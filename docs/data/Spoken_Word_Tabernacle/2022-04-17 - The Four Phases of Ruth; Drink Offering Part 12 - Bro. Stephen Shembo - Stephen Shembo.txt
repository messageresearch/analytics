where brother branham say happy easter so i'm going to read it to you brother branham say good morning to you a very happy easter to each one of you this is one of the greatest days in commemoration

see our jesus and we are so happy to be here this morning one day on this great day and to see the sun rising and the flowers arising from the earth everything speaks of water do you speak of easter teal so when we see you singing and praising the lord we know that somebody is alive because jesus rose again from the dead amen bless be blessed be the name of the lord we greet you all in the name of jesus christ and any family members here this morning we don't have visitors god richly bless you we got family members amen anybody updated with the sermon who is up to date let me see your hand oh okay somebody is still sleeping up amen hallelujah last week was pretty heavy right okay was heavy did you have a time to review it okay your boss told me already so i gotta go over it and touch up a little bit so we make sure nobody is left behind amen your boss love you so much i'm sitting there and before you know it i have to go back somewhere i'm like i already covered somebody's missing it somebody gotta get it somebody gotta get it amen we're reading our cod and church age book blessed be the name of the lord the trustee called me to remind you on building fund so don't get mad at me you get mad on him which i don't think you will if you do then you in the other court [Laughter] amen our house meeting lords willing will be on may the 21st brother of it and that will be at the trustee's home so brother james and sister fenny open the home and they want us to have the house meeting the question and answer there so the sign up city is up there if somebody need they want to take over and sign up it's all right there in a vegetable you can go ahead and do it so it's may the 21st how many heard me saying that so you have up to more than a month to prepare for work schedule and everything don't come back at the last time a manager say if you don't work we're going to close the company we don't want one of those i know how to say that amen amen so make sure you're there we're now recording this question and answer we answer a lot of questions and i learned myself a lot answering those questions so when you're missing it there is no way we can redeem it unless you go sit with somebody who really really really really was paying attention and they can tell you everything all over amen blessed be the name of the lord so let's go to our scripture this morning it's going to be genesis chapter 14. yeah that was a heavy meal last sunday when you get to the mathematics of god it's a problem but don't worry one of this day we will sit and talk to you about how the math in the bible works amen do you know that even your name have numbers your name have numbers there is a way they read numbers in the name you see there is more in this message than you even think amen blessed be the name of the lord oh my let me just leave that alone genesis 14. if you dare you can say amen genesis 14 verse 18. you know this very well and you need this because to get to the holy place you definitely have to understand melchizedek and i believe we went through melchizedek before you should have an idea who melchizedek is amen amen verse 18 and melchizedek king of who you know what it means right you might be seated now pay attention because your boss is reviewing this so we don't want to miss you if you have reviewed the sermon then it will be easy on you amen and melchizedek king of selima this man called melchizedek we went through this before depending on the old testament or new testament there is a way to write it but he's a king a king of selem which was speaking about jerusalem not the earthly but the heavenly because at that time jerusalem was not even existing amen king of selem brought forth water bread and water this man when he came to oh brother robert is getting that quickly bread and what amen he brought forth bread and wine and he was the priest of the most high god so this man was not only a king as you know already but he was also a priest so every time you see priest connected with king you already know that he's speaking about who that's how you read the bible so when you see king priest automatically melchizedek amen verse 19 and he blessed him and say blessed be abram of the most high god possessor of heaven and earth and blessed be the most high god it looks like he's blessing himself blessed be the most high god which has delivered your enemies into your hand this is not a visitor this is a family member that's why i say i welcome all the family members but i need to give a special attention we got brother sam's daughter and her family here god rich you bless you and welcome amen they move down here so they're living very close by so you saw them on wednesday when i say his family members sometimes we don't get it but family member means really family member so you're not visitor here we already knew one another before the foundation of the world long long long time ago amen all you have to do is just talk to somebody before you know it it looks like like i know you 10 years yes we know each other from eternity right my brother so you're welcome there is no visitor amen blessed be the name of the lord and blessed be the most high god verse 20 which has delivered your enemies into your hand and he gave him tithe of all everybody clear there i'm not going to preach on path you already know what it means let's go to genesis chapter 28. if you're not doing it that's between you and your god so genesis 14 king priest that combination speak about melchizedek which we know melchizedek is guarding tiophony everybody clear now we already went through this this is god in tiophony and he often speak of the word the word body of god amen or the pillar of fire genesis 28 verse 10. if you dare you can say amen and jacob went out from beersheba and went toward heron so he's fleeing because his brother is trying to kill him he stole the blessing everybody okay verse 11 and he lighted up on a certain place and terry there all night so he got to a certain place at the sunset because he was traveling they were he was going by the light of the day which is the sun but it reached a point where the sunset began to come in and he stopped to a place and the night was there so the light changed from the light of the sun to the light of the star at night you don't have the sun at night you have the stars so jacob is in this place at night so the sun is no longer shining what is shining now is depending on the light of the star that's how you read the bible amen you don't just read at night and you continue that's why brother branham said you don't read the bible like a newspaper he said and he lighted up on a certain place and tarry there all night under the light of the stars because the sun was water so the sun is no longer there so knights speak of the absence of the sun and the reflection of the star everybody so when you see a star automatically you know that we are at night you need to depend on the light of the star to help you move in we okay now because the sun is not there but the star are speaking of the sun that is somewhere everybody okay because the sun was set and he took off the stones of that place so that place was filled with stones and put them for his pillows some of us don't even want to sleep with a pillow because it's uncomfortable sometimes now this man uses stone for a pillow how can you put a stone for a pillow is that comfortable how can his head rest on the stone which is a rock that's why brother branham say put your head in the word amen and he amen off the stone of that place and put them for pillows and lay down in that place to sleep sleeping on the stone and he dreamed and behold a ladder set up on the earth and the top the top of it reached to heaven so there is a connection between our heaven and earth and behold the angels of god ascending and descending on it ever clear and behold the lord stood above it right on top in heaven and say i am the lord god of abraham your father and the god of isaac the land whereon you lie to you will i give it and to your seed he's repeating the same thing he told abraham verse 14 and your seed shall be as the dust of the earth he already told abraham this and you shall spread the broad to the west and to the east and to the north and to the south the fourth point and in you and in your seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed the same blessing of abraham has been handed down to somebody verse 15 and behold i am with you and will keep you in all places wherever you go what a protection and will bring you again into this land for i will not leave you until i have done that which i have spoken to you off amen what a promise verse 16 and jacob awakened out of his sleep and he said surely the lord is in this place and i knew it not and he was afraid and say how dreadful how awesome is this place this is no other but the house of god so he recognized that that place was the house of god what do you do in the house of god amen and this is the gate of heaven everybody okay and jacob rose up early in the morning and took the stone one that he had put for his pillows ever here and set it up for a pillar so the stone turned into a pillar a memorial ever here it was a stone for him to put his head now that stone is immorphy into a memorial good to see you mama amen he's turned into a memorial amen and then he poured oil upon the top of it everybody clear he poured oil upon the top of it and he called the name of that place bethel ever care but the name of that city was called lowe's at first everybody care so jacob rose what he did he set up the pillow and he took oil and he poured upon the top of it he consecrated that place everybody clear and that place became the place of god verse 20 and jacob vowed a vow saying if god will be with me and will keep me in this day that i go i will give and will give me bread to eat and remnant to put on so that i come again to my father's house in peace then shall the lord be my god and the stone which i have set for a pillar shall be god's water house and all that you shall give me i will surely give the tenth to you who taught him that abraham gave the tenth this one give the ten who taught him that let's go to second samuel chapter 23 then we pray melchizedek bread and wine jacob oil pour on top of a stone with jacob we have oil it out everybody second samuel chapter 23 verse 15. if you're there you can say amen and david longed it was just his desire he didn't force anybody david longed and said oh that one will give me drink off the water of the well of bethlehem which is by the gay did he designated anybody he just said i wish somebody can give me water from bethlehem for some reason somebody when they heard that something in them turned on amen and the three mighty men who told them to go david just wished somebody could give it to him but the wish turned into a command everybody somebody heard the wish say oh he's just wishing that's fine i keep going my way somebody else heard he said that's not a wish that's not really a wish i need to go get the water for my team one got into action one just heard and continued doing what he was doing amen and the three men mighty man broke through the host they begin to do some work some labor he was not a host where you're going through and you say hello and the philistines are saying hello how are you doing good to see you this morning no it was a fight they have to fight through a horse to get water they have to work hey and the three maori men broke through the host of the philistine and drew water out of the well of bethlehem karma that was by the gate and took it and brought it to david nevertheless he would not drink thereof but he did what he poured it out to him so david gave god an offering of water so the offering is not only an animal or a beast an offering can be also in liquid form anybody care so a david poured out water david pour it out to water as an offering unto the lord everybody care as an offering unto the lord he poured out water why did he pour that water and he says be far from me oh lord that i should do this is not this the blood that water when david is looking at that to him it's a bladder the water that you're looking at water david is calling that it's a blood it's a blood because it took some sacrifice it took some work it took some labor it took somebody's sweating everybody to bring the water so it's no longer water it turned into blood and that blood turned into an offering unto the lord okay and he says is not this the blood of the man that went in jeopardy of their lives therefore he would not drink it these things did these three mighty men melchizedek brought bread and wine jacob brought oil and poured that out and david water and poured that out let's pray heavenly father lord we thank you again for your grace for your love and your mercy and for everything you have been doing for us father thank you for this great day of easter because he always remind us of the greatest victory that was ever accomplished in humanity when man finally lord father lord became victorious over death lord once for all and not only for himself but for his seed that was coming after him lord father we thank you for easter for your life lord that you have given us lord for his sacrifice lord because without it nobody was able to even face you or enter into your presence today we can sing we can talk to you freely just because of what you did on calvary of rising up lord and sending back the holy spirit upon your children father may you move me completely out of the way may you come and speak to your children may you be the alpha and the omega lord bless those that are streaming online lord father and speak to us all again because it takes only the action of the spirit lord to unfold your word and bring a revelation to your children we commit everything unto the hand may you touch those that are feeble and sick among us lord may you strengthen your children and bless them in the name of jesus christ amen blessed be the name of the lord the bible says in the book of hebrews 13 here that wherefore jesus also that he must sanctify the people with water with his own blood suffer without the gate so the blood is what sanctifiers my subject this morning is the four phases of roof the drink offering everybody okay if you notice we still have the table of the showbread but we see jacob there pouring oil upon a stone but here when we started this series in the roof we found out that the tabernacle have a language of the plan of redemption that man that god is trying to save man or god is trying to bring man unto himself amen and we took roof and through the stages of roof we found out how roof moves into the gate her roof moves straight and enter into the uh into the tabernacle and then begin to interact with the brazen altar which is repentance and from there he moved she moves into the level from the level she enter into the holy place where we are now roof is in the holy place or roof under luther on the wesley roof under sanctification roof serving or roof under armenian amen now brother branham says this just as a remember he said christ is in all the old testament in all the old testament that's why brother branham said if you read the bible you don't see jesus christ what do you have to do you need to go back again and read it again amen because christ is the very theme of the entire bible brother branham say had the hazard and the cedarwood and all mixing together had the wood in the tabernacle had the brazen altar deliver the showbread which we touched on last sunday everything is pointing to christ everybody here and they so when you look at the tab and i call it crust when you look at the gate it's crushed when you look at the door it's cast when you look at abraham it's christ you look at david's castle you look at joseph's crust everything that you're looking in the entire book of the bible is speaking about jesus christ ever here but you need to read christ everybody okay because the crust in the showbread is a different crust than the crust in the river but it's still the same person i'm refreshing so i pick up whoever i lost last week everybody okay so far the crust in the brazen altar is different than the christ in the ark of the covenant but both of them are still speaking about christ their brother stephen in this church now is different than the brother stephen in eagle chamber dentistry but he's still the same person the brother stephen here is a pastor the brother stephen tomorrow he's going to be a dentist but he's still the same person if you come on my work tomorrow you will see me pulling teeth out but if you come here this morning you will see me preaching the gospel so you need to know how you approach me whether you want to approach me as a doctor or you want to approach me as a pastor or you want to approach me as a brother or you want to approach me as a neighbor or you want to approach me as a father or you want to approach me as a husband oh you want to approach me as anybody okay depending on how you interact with me but i'm still the same person so christa is the showbread christ is delivered christ is the house of christies everything into the tabernacle now when we looked at the way the tabernacle was placed on the on the wilderness the tabernacle was placed right in the middle of israel and all the camp of israel were camping all the tribe were camping all around over there everybody here and the interest of the tabernacle was from the east and now we're talking about melchizedek i need to stress up this one if you coming into the east and you're trying to enter into the tabernacle you need to put your seat belt because we're going up everybody okay when you're coming from the east and you're trying to enter into the gate of the tabernacle you don't just come and enter into the gate you are actually crossing certain parts of the camp of israel before you enter into the gate my brother in the computer stay tight everybody here so when you are approaching over there for some reason when god told israel to camp around the tabernacle god told israel that the camp of judah should camp on the east side everybody here and this camp of judah here was a camp that was given the promise for kingship in other words all the king of israel must come through judah did i lost you so judah is a tribe that is responsible to produce king in israel anybody care and for some reason once you cross this tribe responsible for king as you begin to move you found out that before you enter the tabernacle there is a lever that is step right there everybody here and deliver toward the priest amen did i lose you are we okay so far you need to stay awake amen so delivered was the tribe that was producing the priest so before you enter the tabernacle of god you are crossing the king everybody okay then you cross the priest then you arrive at the gate but when you have a combination of a king and a priest it is speaking about her everybody okay so far this is how you read the tabernacle did i lose anybody anybody care so far and then as soon as you move right there you find that under this priest you have liver himself you have moses and you have aaron because the bible says that moses and aaron are the priests of the lord moses was a prophet but according to psalm 99 verse 6 the bible says moses and aaron among his water there were certain other livers that were there among around the tabernacle but those levers were not priests anybody here you can be a levite and not being a priest but you cannot be a priest if you are not a leaver you remember that so far so as you enter in the tabernacle you are crossing the king and you are crossing the priest and as soon as you finish that the next thing that follows you is what is the gate now in hebrew chapter 7 verse 1 the bible says for this melchizedek who is king of salem we already seen that in genesis 14 and priest of the most high god who met abraham returning from the slaughter of the king and bless him to whom also abraham gave what the tenth part of all first being by interpretation king of righteousness so melchizedek has a problem melchizedek if i can get another one he's king of righteousness everybody okay he's king of righteousness and after that also he's king of water king of selem which means kings of water so melchizedek is king of righteousness and his king of peace in other words under melchizedek we have two kings [Music] everybody here so far melchizedek is king of righteousness the first kingship and he is also king of peace the two kings are under melchizedek everybody okay so far i'm trying to catch you up over there in romans 14 verse 17 the bible says that the kingdom of god when we talk about the kingdom of god we have a kingdom the kingdom of god the bible said the kingdom of god is not meat and drink when you take meat and drink everybody okay this is in the natural everybody okay so the kingdom of god is not meat over there and it's not drink but what is it the bible says but it is righteousness everybody okay amen and it is water anybody okay and melchizedek is king of water and he's king of water so the kingdom of god is home everybody okay so far are we coming okay everybody okay so far so mercy said that the kingdom of god is not really a natural meat and a natural drink because we know that when melchizedek met abraham he brought abraham water bread is a meat and wine is a drink [Music] everybody okay we found out that the kingdom of god is not meat and drink but yet when melchizedek met abraham he gave him bread and he gave him wine and wine is a drink and bread is a meat anybody okay so the kingdom of god is not meat and drink but it's righteousness come on it's peace and it's water righteousness and peace speak about melchizedek what about joy in the holy ghost speak of what we figure it out anybody here so far brother brown says this brother problem says this he says if you notice here when you pass the king when you pass the priest which is melchizedek what follows straight after that is the gate in other words once you cross melchizedek everybody okay the next station that follows in the tabernacle is the gate and we know that jesus said straight is the gate because the gate was jesus christ himself ever here so when you coming to enter the tabernacle you are crossing first god in his revelation as melchizedek everybody okay but melchizedek will turn into a gate brother branham says this brother bonham said to remember that great melchizedek bucky under who had no beginning of days he never had a father nor a mother everybody here he never had an end of life that still lives today then was what kisadek was incarnated anybody okay called jesus christ he became flesh died went back to it again he's still the king of peace the king of righteousness promising us these great eternal things brother branham said in this message in the message who is this melchizedek he said he was at the beginning the word and in morphe body which is the theophany he came in and lived in that in the person of melchizedek everybody okay then later we never heard no more of melchizedek because he became who melchizedek was the priest but he became who so as you move from the from the tribe of judah and from the tribe of of liver as you live in melchizedek the first thing that receives you in the tabernacle is the gate because melchizedek will become the gate merchandiser that will become jesus christ this man who was a theophany this man who was a word would turn from the word and the word will be made flesh in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god but that word was made flesh and that word dwell among us so melchizedek turned into the gate and melchizedek become jesus christ that's why the gate of the tabernacle had four pillars because the ministry of jesus christ is contained in four gospel look matthew john and oh mark did i lose anybody blessed be the name of the lord brother branham says this he said notice his title he is king of righteousness king of righteousness and king of peace he's two kings he is two kings everybody okay king of righteousness also the king of peace he is two kings there already regarded written there now since he has come in the flesh he was married made flesh and received his own body god became flesh in the person of jesus christ in revelation 21 16 he is called the king of king everybody okay he's all three of them together king god anybody okay king theophany and king water we got three kings over there everybody but two of those king are written under melchizedek everybody okay so far brother branham continued he said it's all met just like soul body and spirit all come to make harmony and he is the father which was the first then the sun and the water the spirit king of righteousness which is the spirit attribute the king of righteousness brother branham say it means the spirit of god everybody care and then theophany which is king of water so king of peace is speaking about the tea or fanny of god which is the word everybody okay amen and in the flesh everybody when the world was made flesh ever here he was king of water right here he becomes king of king what is going on the spirit of god was living alone in the beginning was god hey but here god was eternal and god left that state of being just a spirit invisible and god changed into a theophany everybody here so the spirit enter a light body that is called the theophany ever here when the spirit enters the light body back here the first king enter the second phase he becomes two king mark here when these two king enter into the body of a flesh they made three kings but all these three are one open first john chapter three so somebody doesn't struggle let's go to first john chapter 3 hallelujah did i lose anybody blessed be the name of the lord actually john [Music] 1st john chapter 5 if you dare you can say amen if you there you can say amen amen let's go to verse six this is he that came by water and water blood even who jesus christ not by water only but by water and water and it and it is the spirit that bear witness because the spirit is truth everybody okay watch verse seven for there are how many three the bear record where in heaven come out the first is come water the second is water kama and the third is water and these three are water any question everybody okay so right here melchizedek is king of righteousness which is the spirit attribute of god he's the king of peace which is the word attribute of god he's talking but when melchizedek or the word was made flesh in the man jesus christ melchizedek the god now took the title of king of king hey back here so you got two king over there and here you got one of them that one put everybody together everybody okay so far amen so when you enter into when you're coming into the tabernacle you crossing melchizedek you crossing the king then the priest then he turned into the gate everybody okay and once you enter into the gate then you start your redemption everybody okay when you enter into the gate and you cross the gate everybody your redemption started right there why because god had a promise to israel and god told israel that if you will obey my voice indeed and you keep my covenant then you shall be a peculiar treasure unto me above all the people for all the earth is mine the melchizedek and you shall be unto me a kingdom of water and the holy water so god wanted the entire nation of israel to become a kingdom of priests why because god himself was a priest and a king everybody okay but what happened when the word was made flesh the book of john said that he came unto his own to the jews and his own receive him not and guess what they rejected jesus christ and they crucified him and the blessing went into the gentile now in revelation 1 verse 5 the bible said that from jesus christ who is the faithful witness and the first begotten of the dead and the priests of the kings of the earth unto him that loved us and watched us from our sin in his own water and has made us water who is king and priest anybody okay so when christ is coming when you are entering the gate of the tabernacle the purpose of god is to turn you into a king and to a priest [Music] everybody here because brother branham said the normal way we should come on this earth we should have left the thought of god and enter in our telephony and then after we enter into our theophany like jesus christ then we come into flesh because this is what god did god left the spirit form enter into a theophany and then god was made flesh that's why jesus was not able to sin ever here but the problem with you and me we move from the spirit all the way to flesh and we never pick up our theophany everybody okay and our theophany was melchizedek in melchizedek that's why god is coming so that he can bring you back again so you can go back to the step that you've missed you bypass a step so jesus christ by dying he's bringing you back again so you can recuperate the step that you miss you need to go get your own word body your antiopening then your spirit your body and your teeth and it will make you exactly like god because god was a spirit god was a theophany and god was also flesh we got our spirit we got our body our flesh but we're missing our tiopani that's why our tea often is calling our tea off and he's longing to join with you but there was no way your theophany can come to you because of sin so somebody must come down and die and pay the price and go to the grave and resurrect it again and because of easter because of his resurrection now we have the right to go back in the tabernacle and to recuperate our theophany everybody okay so far that's why you heard brother branham saying he's borrowing my body because that is not the body of god that was the body of brother branham so god have to borrow to do something but god has his own body which is the body of jesus christ which is the body that looked like this man that you see right here when you see this man you see god philip when you see me you see god because me and my father we are one [Music] everybody okay so far first peter says that he also has lively stone i build up a spiritual water a holy water not ironic priesthood he's bringing you into a new priesthood which is the priesthood of melchizedek to offer up spiritual water not natural sacrifice because israel was offering natural sacrifice anybody okay spiritual sacrifice acceptable to god by whom by your a chosen water you remember that a royal water a priesthood that is combined with a king royal king priesthood royal prison you are children of melchizedek it doesn't have anything to do with your nationality it doesn't have anything to do with your blood it doesn't have anything to do with your race you only have one race which is the race of god [Applause] everybody here a royal priesthood a holy nation a peculiar water that you should shove off his the praise of him who has called you out of darkness into his marvelous water which in turn pass you another people you were far from god but are now the people of god which had not obtained mercy but now have obtained who mercy by who by jesus christ ever here that's why it's important for you to understand how you are approaching the gate you are approaching the gate by moving this way and when you move you find jesus christ and jesus christ open the gate and but here when you're entering dead then your redemption starts everybody okay so far so when you enter the tabernacle in the tabernacle now you're gonna find out that you have station you have sixth station everybody okay because this sixth station six speak of the number of men are we okay so far and we found out that christ was the tabernacle christ was delivered christ was the showbread christ was the president christ is everything but that crust have a meaning or a message behind it but here they crushed in the brazen or to have a message the crust in the level has a message and the sooner you decode the message you're going to understand what god wants to do for you everybody cares so far so as you entering now the tabernacle everybody here your first interaction you must interact with the president everybody okay when you interact with the president the president although we already explained to you that it's the cross you must first come at the cross everybody here that's why you repent that's why you ask forgiveness that's why you talk to jesus christ you recognize yourself as a sinner whether you were born in a message or not you are still a sinner but here whether you went in a nightclub or not you are still a sinner because we were born in sin sharpening iniquity coming into the world speaking what everybody must meet jesus christ at the cross if you were born in this message and never met christ at the cross you are still a sinner but here when you meet jesus christ you must remind yourself that lord i am a sinner even if you never drunk any drink in your life because when you were a leader you were lying because when you were leader you were taking things and hiding you were doing shady things but you just didn't smoke but that doesn't make you a believer that make you a sinner as much as the sinner that is on the street so when you come your first interaction is with the president and the president this is where you die this is where you die from your country you die from your family you die for your kindred you die for your friend you die from everything that was connected to you everybody here as you did then you take a decision at the president then you move to the next station and your next station is a water baptism you don't stop right there except if you're dying right there in the hospital when you meet the second stage you must be baptized it is essential everybody here the baptism you are showing everybody that this is the side i'm on now i was a sinner before but because i met jesus christ as the altar i am no longer a sinner i'm going to show everybody that i belong to the christian family that's why you get baptized as an outward big witness to the entire church that now i'm part of you everybody okay so far but you cannot stop right there because you're still outside when you reach these two levels or when you have interacted with these two furniture of the tabernacle you reach the summit of justification you have fulfilled the message of luther i'm letting that soak in but you must be careful because the longer you stay here there is a danger and the danger of staying in this state longer is calvina calvin will take the grace that save you at the altar the grace that brought you from darkness and brought you into the christian family and will turn that grace into a disgrace ever here until you are christian for a long time in a message but you are still doing mean things to other people because for you grace is everything as long as grace is there you're going to go to heaven you fell under the trap of kavanaugh are we okay so far so as soon as you get baptized you need to move forward and your next station will be under the golden candlestick which is the third level and under the current candlestick there is a program god wants you to understand god wants you to understand that for each age he's dealing with a specific person and that person is the message of the the messenger for that age and that messenger is the candlestick or the chief reaper and you must find a pastor that is following the message and you must stay under that pastor in a church that follow the light that has been given for your age because that is god filled for your redemption everybody here so far and once you go over there into the candlestick the candlestick doesn't stack you to them [Music] i never started a move to bring people to me the candlestick always point you towards something else if you notice the candlestick heavy light and the light will shine upon something so as soon as you recognize the candlestick ever here off your edge you need to check and not add the candlestick anymore but at what the candlestick are shining that is what brings you all the way to the table of the show bread which is your footage everybody okay so far anybody okay so far then you begin to eat the bread that is illuminated or that is shown upon by the candlestick but here when you reach this stage you reach the top of sanctification you have fulfilled the message of wesley everybody okay so far but you need to be careful for staying here longer because armenians will come down and he will pull you out again and bring and take the message of the day and make it a legal message for you everybody until you begin to obey the message as a legalist don't worry we are coming down the road to roof under sanctification you will understand what sanctification is everybody here the commandment of god are not supposed to be a burden [Music] anybody here when the word of god become a burden to you something is wrong when you are doing this thing because if i don't do it i'm going to go to hell something is wrong that is a minion everybody here armenian will work themselves for their own salvation showing god that they are worthy to go to heaven everybody here there is a danger there okay so as soon as you come here you enter there you move there you must remember there is another furniture in the holy place i'm giving you a journey so this help you anybody care that furniture that is there is the altar of instance which is water but here so as soon as you are eating the bread brother branham say if you want to get closer to god what do you do read your bible and do what read your bible and do what read your bible and do what everybody okay so far as you praying and you begin to consecrate yourself more everybody okay somebody will appear to you everybody okay that person is seymour do you know him how many know him how many know him in 1906 in azusa street amen a group of people begin to pray god they want to see the manifestation and the move of god and they begin to pray and fast and pray and pray and they did it for so many days until the holy spirit drop down like in the day of pentecost everybody here and when the holy ghost jump upon them they begin to speak in tongues that's what started the pentecostal movement anybody okay so far everybody okay so far so your prayer life will open the door to certain gifts that's why cornelius without the holy ghost could pray and see the angel of god but no holy ghost yet do you follow me but you don't stay here longer because there is another danger right here everybody are following me they are danger is billy graham and all of robert brother branham said if there is somebody that knows how to preach repentance better than anybody he knows was billy graham everybody here billy graham is pulling you back again to the present altar and after you give your life to jesus christ you are left alone and brother branham said before you know it 30 000 people receive jesus christ they come next year nobody comes to church everybody's gone back into the world because they stuck at the present altar they could not move anymore and the devil just pulled them back again into the world and they back again into the world amen and the other stream is oral robert oram which means month which deal with the pentecostal and the gift over there they're going to take you in their anointing and speaking in tongues and leaving all kind of anointing by dressing and living like a devil [Music] so the gift of the spirit begins to work in your life but your life doesn't change that's why jesus said many will come in that name and say have we not done cast out devil in your name do many miracles in your name and jesus said i never what they were suck unto aurora robert that's why brother brother say billy graham and oral robert both of them their gospel blinds the people everybody okay so far everybody okay so far so as soon as you get there there is one more station for you and that station is number six which is dealing with the ark of the covenant this is where god will meet you right there everybody okay so far if you look there this picture is in green this picture is in green this picture is in green this picture is in green these are your red spot that you need to watch why because luther preached justification wesley preached sanctification this brought the baptism of the holy spirit we go restoring back the gift so justice sanctification justification made way to water sanctification made what way to what the baptism of the and the baptism of the holy spirit made the way to do everybody okay so far everybody okay so far so until you get here then you know you in the rest with god when you're moving here be careful your snake is there be careful your snake is there be careful the snake is still there when you get here this is what killed the snake anybody here hey back here that's why when brad abraham came he began to condemn organized religion he began to preach why where did the pentecostal fail he began to show all this kind of stuff to remove everything so that god can come and kill the snake in your life everybody okay so far remember this journey so roof under lute roof under calvin roof under wesley roof under armenian roof under seymour roof and the oral robert and billy graham and roofing the message of brother branham hallelujah everybody okay so far did i lose anybody okay let's go back to our showbread when we were dealing with the showbread last week praise god we found out that the bible says that the showbread was made of twelve cakes two tenths a deal because the ark in the car of the covenant have the uh the mana and the measurement of the manner was one tenth and this is two tenths which is twice the mana everybody okay let's leave it alone and those two row and and those twelve cake the bible said that they were set in two rows of six rows per terrible everybody here and they put frankincense on them and they were changing them every sabbath and the one who was cooking that bread must be a liver or a consecrated person to cook the bread remember the one who cooked the bread must be a consecrated person everybody okay so far so when we look at the measurement of the table of the showbread we found out that we compared those measurements with the ark of the covenant we found that the left of the of the table was two cubits the breath was one cubit the height was a cubit and a half and in the arc of the covenant the left was 2.5 the breadth was 1.5 and the height was 1.5 and the difference between the arc of the covenant i'm picking you up so we can go up whoever lost it last week everybody here so the difference between the oak and the table of the show bread because this has bread this has bread the difference was on the breath and on the left everybody okay when you take for instance the breath of the ark which is 1.5 and you take the breath off the table which is one and if you make the difference between them it gives you 0.5 everybody okay so far i have to do this because your boss want me to do it everybody clear everybody so far when you take the life of the ark of the covenant and you compare it with the length of the table and you make the difference it still gives you 0.5 and the height did not change because the height was 1.5 and if you compare the height to the other height it's gonna give you zero so the difference between the arc of the covenant and the table of the showbread was half and but here that's where we ended up with the difference being a half but if you notice this table here there is two rows in this table right here number two and each row have six bread you remember that so when you take six bread and you multiply by two raw it gives you what 12 which is a number of water and we found that six was the number of a man whoever lost it let's get it everybody here we found that we have two rows everybody here we have a table right here we have two row the first row has six bread the second row have six bread and six is the number of men and six is the number of men both of these men are in the same table about here and when you take six plus six he gave you 12 which is a number of worship everybody so these two men are in this table for worship everybody okay so far do you want me to repeat or i lost somebody everybody okay so far so we got two men sitting on this table and both of them bring worship unto god and we found out that the church of god is made out of jews people and it's made out of agenda you remember the body of a samaritan america and these two are in one church worshipping god because jesus said that the hour cometh that's the true it's not in jerusalem where the jews are where we worship the lord it's not gonna be again in samaria to worship the lord but the true worshiper will worship god in spirit and in truth all that god is required is somebody to worship him in spirit and in truth regardless of their language regardless of their country regardless of their place of birth as long as you worship god in the spirit and in the truth then god pick you up so the temple right here is no more for jewish people only he got both jews and he got the gentile mixed together in one table and the two of them bring worship so you got the blood of jesus christ mixed with the jews and the gentiles and the gentiles are bringing worship unto the lord everybody clear so far paul says this in first corinthians chapter 10 he said for we being many are what everybody okay we are jews we are gentle we are many people for in the blood of jesus christ but all of us we are harmony bread one bread even though it looks one two three four five six seven all the way to twelve all those bread everybody okay we are many but we are one bread camera and we are how many body for we are all partaker of that what both the jews and the gentiles we are eating of jesus christ and then we become one bread that's why we stuck in one table did i lose somebody amen so when we talk about the half we found that the half was hidden in the uh in the rainbow when we pulled the rainbow if you remember the candlestick was sending the light towards something according to the scripture the bible says in the book of uh exodus 25 that that shall make the seven lamps thereof and they shall light the lamps thereof they need to put lights on them that they may give light over against it so if the light if the lamps are here the light cannot go this way they have to go in the opposite everybody here if the lamp are looking like this they have to give light this way if the lamp are looking this way they have to give light this way so the lamp were giving light on the opposite of them everybody okay and the bible say in exodus 26 that that shall set the table without the veil and the candlestick over against it so the table of the showbread and the candlestick were up were opposite to one another everybody care and then the table was on the staff and the uh i'm sorry the table was on the north and the candlestick were on the south side everybody so which means that when you enter the tabernacle like we already said this lamp are shining straight toward the table where the breads are everybody okay and the light here of the candlestick we found out that it was the light of the star anybody care so you got the bread right here that are receiving the light from the star everybody which the bread we know it's the word of god so the messenger of the age when he comes in the edge do you follow me god will give him an inspiration and that inspiration is a light everybody okay and then luther will open the bible and he will find a place that says the just shall live by faith and when looter take his light and he shine it in that scripture luther bring a message of justification and that become the bread of god for that hour if you want to go to heaven in that hour you need to come on the looter to preach to hear the word that looter is giving light through it everybody cares so far so you look at every single messenger brother branham said they were seven colors of the rainbow but where did this rainbow start from in the book of ezekiel chapter one the bible says above the filmman that was over the head the head of the caribbean was a likeness of a throne as the apparent the appearance of sapphire stone and upon the likeness of the throne was the likeness as the appearance of a man above it so we got a throne somebody is there sitting on the throne on the throne we got a man sitting there everybody here you're dealing with a throne and a man and the bible says that and i saw as the color of ember we went through this in a hotel as the appearance of fire round about within him from the appearance of his loins upward you remember in the hotel and from the appearance of island even downward i saw as it were the appearance of fire somebody that looked like fire everybody here and he had the brightness round about it so around this person right here 360. there is an appearance anybody here and the bible says as the appearance of the bow that is in the cloud in the day of water so the rainbow right here in the book of uh ezekiel was all around god like this we gotta run about 360. everybody but in the day of noah when god exposed that rainbow he only gave half of it amen that's why when you when you go you're going to see half of it everybody okay so far and the bible said that he was last so as the appearance of the brightness round about it this was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of who the glory of the lord is a rainbow that is 360 which is a circle of eternity but god split the two anybody here ah but the the bible says in the book of revelation chapter 4 that immediately as i was in the spirit a throne was set in heaven another throne the same one and one sat on the throne we know it's god not two person and he does saturn so that's that was to look like jasper and sadist serving stone and there was a red bull how 360. everybody here but when the rainbow appear it's only appearing half of the rainbow everybody here for you to have god the glory or the full glory of god everybody clear you need to have the first rainbow and the second rainbow pulled together everybody here so what did god do to the rainbow anybody okay god split the rainbow into everybody here this rainbow have seven colors everybody okay and the second rainbow have seven colors everybody clear these colors are not different anybody here they are the same everybody here and as long as you're dealing with seven colors you are still missing god hey back here for you to have god you need to have this half plus this half he gave you one everybody so the church ages only gave us half of god everybody so when god was splitting the rainbow follow me carefully god took a portion of revelation and hid it on this son and gave portion here anybody here so far lord help me all the mysteries at this time should be finished at the sanding of this messenger now here is the messenger on earth and another angel mighty messenger come down that's in revelation 10. we have brother branham here and we have the mighty angel coming down everybody here so this engine was an earthly angel or an earthly messenger brother branham down here but here come one down from what a rainbow covenant only who so brother branham said in revelation 10 he is down here a messenger and there is another messenger that is coming down here but when this one is coming there is a rainbow that is there with him everybody okay so far brother bonham said just exactly like was in revelation what which chapter the first chapter standing in the midst of the seven water god then came the stick with what so when the golden scandal stick was here in the church ages there was already a rainbow here everybody here but this rainbow was only half of it that's why paul could tell you that i preach in part because there is something that paul cannot get to it because god took it away and back here luther can preach he's going to put somewhere and he stop because there is a portion that was taken out of him every seven of them god took some colors out of him everybody so when we reach revelation 10 god bring the missing part of the column ever here so when you take what was in the church edges plus what is coming up then you receive god in his fullness brother what i'm saying and here he returned back in the 10th chapter after the coming that after the coming time that all the mysteries to be finished and the seals are to be broken and proclaiming that time is what why because he's bringing that brother branham said the whole revelation of jesus christ is completed in the world everybody here the servants here was only revealing what they did what everybody okay what they left off back there and he opened it up what they have left what luther what wesley what all the reformer and the pentecostal on down to the present water so the servant seal that's why the seals doesn't bring something outside of the bible [Music] it was something that was in the bible but it was just hidden so god gave a portion and kept a portion for the end time and in the end time when the mighty angel is coming he's bringing the portion so that everything that luther missed everything that was remit everything the pentecostal missed god bring them together and now we can see the arrow in calvin we can see the error in armenian we can see the error in billy graham we can see the error in oral robert we can see the error everywhere and when the elect of this edge is walking now you are walking carefully watching the arrow until you're gonna make it to the other side because this brad is not gonna fail anymore [Music] [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah brother branham says this let's go back i'm sorry to the showbread the showbread have harmony crown everybody here i have to work twice to get you back back online amen the showbread have two crowns here and those crown were just the border and we found that the two crown the bible says they were separated by handbreadth the hand breath according to david david says that lord make me know my name and the measure of my water behold that has made my days as a water so the measure of a human day is a hand breath which is short which is not too long because we missed eternal life ever here and on the earth of the covenant we have one crown a back here and we know that the table have to have bread which is the number of worship because the true worshiper that god is looking must worship god in water and in water the truth which is what the spirit the spirit and the truth the truth which is what the word the gospel the bible say and how shall we shall they preach except they be sent as it is written how beautiful are the feet of them that preach the water gospel of water and your feet showed with the preparation of the gospel of water the gospel of water everybody here everybody here so the spirit attribute speaker for speak of the king of righteousness remember and the word which is the gospel of peace speak of who do you see on melchizedek do you see a maltese edict and he's bringing you bread and water what is here is what do we see one yet we're getting there everybody okay so far everybody okay so far brother branham saying what is the crown he says a crime means you have the water you are a king if you are crowned because you want us to be kings and what you understand now and then and we are sons of god when we are what with what why eternal life because our days are a hand breath we need melchizedek with the power of immortality to bring us our crown and to crown us with eternal life make you priest and what that's why the quran have to be in that table blessed is the man that endures temptation for when he's tried he shall receive the crown of what why do you receive the crown of life because we were blocked from eternal life go to revelation chapter two let's go to revelation chapter two go to revelation chapter 2. remember the seven church ages started here we have the candlestick if you're in revelation chapter two you can say amen let's go to verse 20 of chapter one watch that verse

garden of eden god blocked the tree of life so that man cannot live because if men eat the tree of life men will live eternally so god blocked the caribbeans but when christ came and died and paid the price the caribbean must open the road and when they opened the road now the tree of life is now available to human beings that's why the veil of the temple was rented into opening the gate and

don't worry i already planned it's easter we'll be all right if you look at this table this table have bread yes but he doesn't have drink the correct table looks like this he has bread and he have certain things there do you remember let me remind you in exodus 25 everybody okay now catch it the bible said that shall make water dishes and water a table with bread and dishes a spoon what do you do in that table command i'm the master caller commandant we shall feast jesus table all the time do you remember he who turned to the comment the water you understand now that's your showbread table [Applause] everybody okay now make the dishes make the spoon make the water and the water the balls for you to cover with that cover without means to pour out everybody here so now that we have already handled the bread let's handle this now when we pull this out what is going on we found that jacob took something uh a stone and he took oil and he poured on the oil and he called that the house a memorial for the house of god you ready what is joy amen what is going on brother stephen number one the bible says in exodus 29 verse 40 and with the one lamb a tenth of deal of flower mingled mingled with a fourth path of a hen the hean is a measurement for liquid anybody care the measurement for liquid amen if it's something solid you got the ifa the tenth fourth of ifa you will see that in the scripture for you who read the scripture you will see the hephae the all the those kind of stuff he said and the fourth part of a hymn of what beating old remember jacob poor oh you okay now and the fourth part of the hint of water one for water so the drink offering in the bible it was made out of water i'm reading your bible because i see somebody's watching me like this open your scripture and verify anybody here the drink of thing in the bible everybody okay was what anybody care can i help you up a little bit can i help you up a little bit can i help you up a little bit melchizedek gave abraham water bread and what melchizedek gave her abraham water and water so the table of the show bread has water and water this church is deadly man [Laughter] are we okay now are we okay now but this drink offering which is one it seems like it's connected with oil did you see that did you see that did you see that did you see oil there let me read it again before they bring the drink offering of wine they bring water first everybody okay leviticus 23 verse 13. and the meat offering thereof shall be two tenths of a deal of fine flour mixed with what an offering made by fire unto the lord for sweet savor and the drink offering shall thereof shall be of what so the drink offering is wine we okay now but oil is there we okay let's continue number 15 for a drink offering that shall offer the third part of a hen of water for a sweet water so this one is giving god a sweet savory everybody here so when you coming with your offering everybody okay you bring in your flour that you make bread with it make sure there is oil and when you moving all don't stop there make sure you have wine because you gave to be sweet everybody okay then shall he bring with a bullock a meat offering and three tough deals of flour mingle with half or half a name of water and that shall bring for a drink offering half of the hint of water it's oil and wine all in one what is going on you okay number 28 and the drink offering therefore shall be the fourth part of him with um for the one lamb in the holy place you see that in the word which place a roof in the holy place right shall that cause the strong wine to be poured out drink offering to be poured out like david pour it out unto him remember david took water and pour that unto the lord for a water the name for drink offering in the bible is called labation labation is a drink offering they give to a deity you can bring a bullock you can bring a lamb you can bring a goat or you can bring a flower but if you want to give god something in liquid the liquid you bring it to god as an offering is wine everybody okay and melchizedek gave abraham braden anybody okay and their drink offering shall be half of a hand of wine for a bullock a third part of iran for a realm a full part of a handful in other words every single type of offering whether it's a ram or a lamb or a bullock you must bring it together with wine and you take the one and you pour that for a drink offering unto the lord everybody okay all right then in the book of luke we found in the story of the good samaritan that when the man was placed there half dead when the good samaritan came and began to restore the man we found out that he burned him if his wound and poor what and what from the old testament everybody okay now now in the book of revelation the bible say i heard a voice in the midst of the four be saying a measure of what what do you do with wheat you make what a measure of what what do you do with barley you make what and penny and that shall not hurt what and what so the table of god through the church ages have bread made out of wheat and made also out of barley but here remember roof have to go in the harvest of wheat and the harvest of barley you remember roof amen but that table also have oil and what one so the devil entered and begin to temper with the bread he began to manipulate the word of god god said okay you playing with the world but do not touch the oil and do not touch the bread or wine ever here so when you enter in my table of show bread i got bread i got oil in it and i got also wine tempered with the bread but don't touch the oil and the wine don't touch my drink offering everybody here don't touch my drink often everybody here you temper with the word you begin to teach them all kind of false doctrine i understand but when you come to the oil when you come to the wine do not touch my oil and one do not touch my drink coffee can i drop something when joseph was in the prison you okay now two officers of pharaoh made mistake one was a baker responsible for bread and the one other one was the water a battler responsible for water they killed the baker but not the one who was handling wine the battle have to be restored back because you don't touch the wine of the king ever here you have the bread and the wine again with joseph in the prison you have the bread and the drink offering right there you have the table of the showbread of pharaoh was touched they killed the baker but they keep the wine because the wine is what judah like because the eyes of judah are like the eyes of wine the king loves wine do you know that do you know that judah was specialized on wine you want to read it let's go to genesis 49 i'm approaching my time so i'm still good let's go to genesis 49 alleluia blessed be the name of the lord genesis 49 if you dare you can say amen let's go to verse 8. you there who is there judah you are he whom your brethren shall do what the line of the tribe of judah you okay your hand shall be at the water you don't play with judah at the neck of your enemy your father's children every child of jacob shall bow down before you judah you see the gate everybody here judah is a what a lion works from the prey my son you are gone up he stooped down he catches a lion and as an old lion who shall rise him up deception for the king shall not depart from water that's why when israel forced god to have a king god release a permissive will and give soul from the tribe of benjamin so messed up then god said you know what i have a man after my own heart which trap did he came out everybody here perfect will devin everybody okay he says that the scepter shall never depart from judah nor a law giver because he's ruling from between his feet until shallow come which is jesus christ and to him shall the gathering of the people water as soon as jesus come the king of king from the tribe of judah the lion that came out of judah then everybody must go back to jesus now everybody okay so far watch verse now 11 binding his fault to the what and his escort to the choice water he washes his garment in what who does that judah and his gloves in the blood of the water that's why you don't touch the wine of judah he washes his clothing with wine everybody ever care verse 12 his eyes shall be red with water the anger of judah is with wine [Music] that's not my wine ever care and he's stiff white with water the milk not when we go back here we find that god scream he said are you messing up on my table of show bread because the candlestick are lighting up the table of the show bread the devil enter in and begin to talk he said therefore be careful don't touch wine don't touch hole don't play with there what is going on in the wine and all ever here hey but here brother boy remember we have wine and oil wine and oil wine and all from the old testament all the way down to the new testament wine oil wine oh why both of them to go together all the time french is coming out maybe i want to speak in tongue ever here the wine symbolizes water of water we okay we okay we okay oh i like to run all over the place one day i didn't wake up wake up the neighborhood when the lord showed me that show me what that wine was the stimulation of what when brother branham saw that what random drop is pain so there is something in wine that does something to the believer everybody okay brother branham saying oil and what in the bible is associated how many times did brother branham give you the scripture the message and the bible he never gave you one scripture and i just put all the scripture together the message perfectly aligned with the scripture brother barnum said they associated always i got a concordance and looked there is a string of them where one and all goes together how many time everybody cares so far what is going on with this one oil symbolize the holy spirit everybody okay then we found that that all and one is connected in what the true worshiper must worship god in the spirit and in the how many bread did we have daughter 12 the number of what and when you reach the number of 12 worship oil and one must be there everybody here he said all in one is connected in worship and always connected in water the one i said which to come that the wine symbolizes that it was the power of the stimulation by water what does it mean what does it mean that is when something has been watered [Music] everybody care he gives stimulation to who because it's presented by water everybody okay so far what does it mean really it is something that god has said it is first a mystery they can understand it and after a while god comes down and does what and then what [Music] [Applause] everybody okay what does it mean when you take your bible and you read something every day and you don't understand it and one day when you read it it looks like you saw something okay and you eat when you saw something even if you were tired you will see you begin to smile you don't know why you're smiling and suddenly something take you up that is wine [Music] [Applause] ever here that is the wine of the spirit before you know it you begin to walk in the kitchen you begin to press the lord you begin to go back up that one make you forget the problem forget the trouble forget the difficulty forget the trial forget everything that is the wine it brings joy joy joy in the holy ghost [Applause] everybody cares so far because god knew that sometimes you're gonna go through trial the devil will beat on you so hard and you feel like you down but when you read brother branham speaking and something knocked down and goes up suddenly you rose up and you moved [Applause] [Music] hallelujah my wife was asking me was telling me something last night and i was watching her i said you're going to understand that tomorrow she said i was reading in the bible the bible says that mary magdalene when jesus christ resurrected she was the first one to see jesus christ out of her came seven devils my wife say and i sat and i said wait a minute a woman is a church and seven devil these are the seven church ages that god is removing demon from his brother and that's the church that will see jesus christ at first i say that's it right now i said now you begin to understand [Applause] she said i read the scripture all the time i never understood it until now i felt like something coming up that was the wine it's a stimulation by revelation it gives the believers stress even if you are down suddenly you rise up and you pull the sword you say therefore i'm coming back again [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah oh hell look he said she was up again yes says something is wrong i thought i got head down no you didn't get her down god has a bullet the line of the revelation [Music] everybody here you come on wednesday night and it looks like the preacher is preaching about you and before you know it you out before you know it you throw your hand out before you know it you begin to scream and when you leave out you put your chin like this you say devil i'm back again [Applause] [Music] play with the bread but don't touch the wine he keep my believer encouraged he keep my children encouraged he give my children strength when they are weak [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah brother branham said he stimulates he give what because it's god's what the new wine the new one does what when it's revealed the water it brings joy beyond what sometimes we want through that it brings such a joy till you get what [Music] you lose up [Applause] ever here that's the joy of the spirit now the kingdom of heaven is not water oh drink it is water and it's water melchizedek and what bread and wine [Music] [Applause] your drink offering your drink offering is always there god love it because when you begin to get into that job you begin to bring praises back to him [Applause] and before you know it that sickness becomes beginning to go without you even praying [Music] because it's the power of praises that come by the stimulation of the revelation and before you know it you begin to damper [Music] hallelujah hallelujah have you seen somebody that is drunk he loves everybody [Music] [Applause] everybody here everybody here everybody care when that stimulation rise up even if you were mad at your husband you will find yourself honey look at this look at this you forgot that you were mad hallelujah let me get to this we are serving now in the middle of melchizedek where we get bread and we got drink that's why melchizedek when he comes bring abraham water and water the table of the showbread amen everybody okay so far brother branham say i do not believe that crochet bread should be substituted for a cracker i believe that it should be a holy unleavened bread the top of unleavened bread that was made in egypt i believe that the blood should not be grape juice but it should be water are you seeing there grape juice sour and spoil as he get water but one get water and water and what and he never loses his water the blood of jesus christ does not sound hospital as he gets old he gets stronger he gets better as the day goes back by the water everybody here you remember the priest in the old testament have to sprinkle the mercy seat with blood seven times but here the more the gospel is moving from paul to arrest to luther to all the way it's getting more but here ever here what about them say and it is a little water and water which speak about water so when you're taking communion melchizedek bread and wine it becomes a worship to you that's why brother branham said it's a duty for the believer to do that because you're eating his bread and you have your drink offering both of them together ever here and communion bread should be made by the people who is what themselves and consecrated themselves to who the showbread has to be made by the you remember that's why communion must be made by somebody who is consecrated because the showbread was speaking about a priest that is consecrated so your communion spiritually speaking is speaking about the table of the show bread amen everybody okay so far everybody okay so far now let's get this and then i'll let you go my god oh my god the bible says brother branham say i'm sorry that for with stammering lips and with other atoms we don't speak to these people and this is the water this is the water the wine that is water it is a drink offering but what does that drink offering do not only does he stimulate you does he give you strength in the trial but about the wine in the bible means water he refreshes you but here this is the refreshment that comes from the presence of who that's why he was called show bread the bread of his presence the show the show him showing the show bread the bread of his presence everybody everybody wine means refreshment let's go to roof two and we stop here hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord the drink offering oil and wine roof chapter 2 and we will stop here hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord amen roof come after the judges if you dare you can say about it ruth chapter 2 verse 9 everybody here let me jump to verse 11 for the sake of time amen on or 10 then she fell on her face and bowed down to the ground and said to him why have i found favor in your eyes that you should take knowledge of me seeing i am ah was she a stranger anymore she was already in the commonwealth of israel remember the field of boaz now have jewish women and a gentle woman that's the church the jews and the gentiles rufus gentile and jewish lady together in the same field the church both jews and gentiles in the same field they were taking barley it was about bread it was about the field of bread with jewish and the gentiles working in the same field of boaz in the same table of boas but if they are in the table of boaz in the field of boaz working with wheat working with the stuff of bread we must see some liquid there we must see a drink offering there you ready you ready and boys have said and said to her he has been full he has fully been shown to me all that you have done to your mother-in-law since the death of your husband she was living for somebody else eternal life she was living for her mother-in-law she sacrificed everything but she want to do everything for her mother-in-law eternal life living for others everybody okay and how you have left your father your mother like abraham and the land of your nativity and i'll come to a people which you knew not before the lord not me roof but the lord recompensed you it's a labor she's serving and the full reward be giving you of the lord of israel under who's what you are come to do water so whatever roof was doing she was getting under the wings of god so when you are entering the tabernacle you are actually entering through the wings of god that's why david said that in in psalm 91 if you under the shadow of almighty anybody care verse 13 then she's saying let me find favor in your sight my lord for that you have comforted me and for that you have spoken friendly to your handmaid to becoming a wife though i be not like one of your handmaids hey barker watch verse 14. and boaz said to her at what time command time the master caller at what time at meal time when it's time to eat you cannot work under a candlestick without having food you already move into my field you enter there is a chief reaper there and there are reapers under and there are maidens there so you already you are already under the candlestick roof but the candlestick are not there just to be candlestick they are there to shine light on food you must have a table roof where you can eat as you laboring you must eat you must have a table as you're going through sanctification and i will show you what is sanctification and how do you get sanctified as you're going through sanctification you need food and you need wine to refresh you so you can continue to work at meal time there must be a table of showbread because she's under the candlestick everybody clear you see the tabernacle in the roof you say at meal time come here and eat of the what everybody okay the table of the show bread what was it bread and eat the what and dip your moisture in what somebody's already laughing so there is a liquid there so there is a table right there in that table there is bread and there is also a liquid vinegar there is bread and there is offering a drink offering because the short table have drink the kingdom of god is not only meat but bread and david took water and turned water into a drink offering america when you come eat bread because you under the candlestick they must give you you must have access to a table when you get tired go to the table go eat what do you eat today you're going to find bread but not only bread you must find some some beverage and the beverage that i have there is vinegar do you know what vinegar does to somebody who's working it refreshes the person the workers in the barber were working drinking vinegar because vinegar refreshed them in the hot season so you must have some refreshment and you must have some bread you cannot be working under the candlestick without having a table a meal table with remember you're already under the candlestick you're no longer in the other coat remember if you get tired there is a table there go a meal time you're gonna find bread and you'll find some refreshment there to refresh as you so you can go back and continue your journey until i meet you on the other side everybody okay anybody okay he said get there and dip your muscle in the vinegar and she sat beside the everybody okay roof start not with the maiden she's beside her look what boaz does and he who's he reached her what who gave roof the bread that scripture that you were reading all the time and you don't understand who handed to you who who who handed you that revelation you were sitting reading the bible you don't understand and suddenly oh i see what brother stephen was preaching oh that's it right here somebody's [Music] corn and she did eat and was water so fast and water get bread but get also water vinegar you need a refreshment why vinegar white vinegar roof is there sitting there and then they give her bread and there is water why vinegar the bible says in the book of john after this jesus knowing [Music] that all things well now i finished the label i have been beaten they spit on me i took the cross i finished everything now i'm at the end i'm at the end i finished the label i'm already tired my blood has been dripping all along i'm losing water there's no more strength i'm crucified ever here when he knew that everything now was accomplished that the scripture might be what he said i do what everybody okay so far did i lose somebody and there was such a vessel full of what why only vinegar everybody here he labors a lot he needs a refreshment everybody hey remember they give him vinegar before he spit it out because they mix it with god and he spit it out and then and the soldier changed and they took vinegar now but they change it to with something else and then there was a set they were there was set a vessel full of water and they feel a sponge with water and put it upon what he's up in the scripture means what anybody here when they took the refreshment you cannot bring the refreshment without combining with faith because the refreshment is always a stimulation by revelation everybody okay the stimulation by revelation that's your drink offering is stimulated by revelation so they took the drink offering and combine it with faith and then they put it and he put it in his mouth when jesus therefore had received the vinegar he said it is game over devil game over [Music] here why because the drink offering when it comes the game is over because you turn your eyes into red like judah that's why the bravo says touch not the oil do not touch the wine that's why when the devil beats you down beat you down beat you down after a while all it takes is just a refreshment after the refreshment comes then you suddenly rose up again i'm ready to fight it is finished level i'm coming back again i'm gonna take my child i'm gonna take my husband i'm gonna take my money i'm gonna take my uncle i'm gonna take my job i'm gonna take my business i'm gonna take my health i'm gonna take everything
