[22:29] okay and um
[22:32] before I gave it to him um
[22:35] uh the Amazon told me to um
[22:38] pick up a trail like spot number so and
[22:41] so I did but it wasn't the usual trailer
[22:43] but I didn't think nothing of it that's
[22:45] what they told me that's what I took
[22:47] right it turned out that trailer tore up
[22:49] my um my lines and my electrical lines
[22:52] and it had done something to the truck I
[22:54] couldn't find out what it was no fuse
[22:57] and fix the wire and still wouldn't give
[22:59] me no lights and everything
[23:01] so I had to put him because I can't turn
[23:04] down the load so I put the drive in the
[23:06] truck and he took off doing his thing
[23:08] without no lights in the trailer naughty
[23:11] naughty but you know
[23:12] well anyways
[23:14] he got pulled over by the state trooper

[35:48] I'm gonna take there's something about a
[35:51] Wednesday night or Tuesday Tuesday this
[35:53] week it brings out the best songs
[35:56] I mean you have to repeat them on Sunday
[35:58] because ain't everybody here
[36:00] you know
[36:02] keep that in mind come on up brother
[36:04] Stephen man that was wonderful right
[36:07] there wasn't it amen
[36:09] amen
[36:19] off the old
[36:22] Pentecostal sky blue skin killing
[36:26] all folks when they were praying praying
[36:30] praying until the Holy Ghost come down
[36:31] that's what he reminded me praise the
[36:34] Lord amen keep up the good work
[36:40] glory to God no matter what's going on
[36:43] we will praise the Lord
[36:45] where the traffic on 85
[36:47] 77 on 485 no matter what it is we're
[36:52] going to praise the Lord nobody will
[36:54] take my place so I'm here tonight no one
[36:57] will take my place
[37:01] amen
[37:03] glory to God everybody on board with the
[37:06] male and female on deity
[37:09] everybody on board
[37:10] everybody clear
[37:12] glory to God nobody lost
[37:15] nobody lost a wing somewhere praise God
[37:18] he had did great
[37:21] oh my it took a lot to build to build to
[37:23] build to that point but praise be to the
[37:26] name of the Lord he keeps unfolding
[37:29] and unfolding and unfolding and now you
[37:32] will see the whole bubble wrapped up in
[37:34] one story that's why I gave you the the
[37:38] the terminology the Brethren the Bride
[37:41] of Jesus Christ the Church of God the
[37:43] saints of God they call that I even seen
[37:45] some of them that we are called The
[37:47] Beloved
[37:48] and Jesus Christ himself is their
[37:50] beloved and in another place we are
[37:52] called The Cult
[37:54] so all of that we're talking about one
[37:56] thing
[37:57] so once you recognize that all those
[38:00] terminologies speaking about you then
[38:02] before you know it you can feel you you
[38:04] can navigate the scripture all around
[38:08] it's one beautiful story of redemption
[38:12] from the beginning all the way to the
[38:14] end he started with a marriage he end up
[38:17] with a marriage over there amen so Eve
[38:20] is nobody else but Adam in a female
[38:23] version
[38:25] Eve is Adam in a female version
[38:29] that's all now you need to see yourself
[38:34] as the second Adam
[38:37] that's what the devil doesn't want you
[38:40] to see amen but Lord's willing we would
[38:43] dig more more until you look you say I
[38:46] cannot leave this world without having
[38:49] the Holy Ghost
[38:50] it belongs to you
[38:53] amen
[38:55] oh my God I was talking to my wife I
[38:58] believe last night I told her I say
[39:01] you know Elijah
[39:03] went through three stages
[39:06] and then the last one there was 50
[39:08] people that followed him which 50 means
[39:11] Pentecost which means the Pentecostal
[39:14] move will try to follow
[39:17] Elijah and Elijah up to a certain point
[39:21] that would stop
[39:22] and when they stop they cannot go
[39:24] further because this the the further you
[39:27] go you need the second oil
[39:30] to open the Jordan yes and to unveil the
[39:33] evidence that was sealed a long time ago
[39:35] and after they found the stone that were
[39:39] hidden then across Jordan the Rapture
[39:42] open up
[39:47] did you get it
[39:48] if I lost you raise your hand
[39:51] I lost somebody
[39:54] okay so what I'm trying to say is there
[39:57] were steps there were three steps that
[39:59] Elijah and Elisha went brother Branham
[40:02] who are tapped them as Luther
[40:04] Wesley and Pentecost and the last one if
[40:08] you look at the scripture the Bible says
[40:09] there were 50 men that left I believe it
[40:12] should be Jericho
[40:14] and to follow them and 50 means
[40:17] Pentecost showing that the last move
[40:19] that will follow the bride is Pentecost
[40:22] amen amen so somebody will get that
[40:24] first oil
[40:27] okay and move on straight a little bit
[40:29] but they won't reach where Jordan is
[40:32] right they will stay afile the bible say
[40:34] that they stood afar off to watch they
[40:38] have the first sword they can go all the
[40:40] way there but they would not temper with
[40:42] that second home and those that got the
[40:45] second all will advance and get to
[40:47] Jordan when they hit Jordan were open
[40:49] was the seal evidence of the 12th Stone
[40:53] now are open
[40:55] when they open you see them once you see
[40:58] the two of sun and you come up from the
[41:00] the revelation of the Rapture open up
[41:03] Man Three
[41:05] three again the Matthew 25 without the
[41:08] second oil there is no rupture you gotta
[41:10] cross the second hole it will open the
[41:12] seals when he opened the seals you see
[41:15] the seals then the revelation of the
[41:16] Rapture comes up one of these State
[41:18] prayed for me so you can see what really
[41:21] happened from a due birth when you are
[41:24] born again what happened
[41:27] what really happened in you when you are
[41:30] born again
[41:32] amen
[41:34] when that happened you might have other
[41:36] things following up you might fall down
[41:39] on the ground you might be start
[41:41] speaking in tongues you can be shouting
[41:44] and running around all kinds of stuff
[41:46] can happen to you but make sure that one
[41:49] thing happened to you
[41:51] in other words when the anointing come
[41:53] you have to do something in you
[41:57] but the holy ghost that you get is not
[42:00] different than what was represented
[42:02] somewhere
[42:03] if your name is represented in the one
[42:07] Holy Ghost
[42:09] that is both male and female
[42:13] you're going to get the Holy Ghost
[42:15] in other words whether you like it or
[42:17] not God will give you the Holy Spirit
[42:20] you can even run away the Holy Ghost
[42:22] will chase you where you are and say I
[42:24] need to enter you
[42:25] until you're going to surrender you're
[42:27] going to get the Holy Ghost
[42:28] amen
[42:30] amen you know the sons of the Prophet
[42:33] knew that Elisha was going
[42:35] yeah Elijah was going they knew it but
[42:38] they did they were not partake care of
[42:40] that mystery but they knew it so don't
[42:43] be impressive Pentecostal touches
[42:45] certain things
[42:46] about the coming of the Lord they will
[42:49] know but they don't really know what's
[42:51] going on remember Russia Rosa that was
[42:55] one curtain
[42:57] amen the ion curtain and China arose up
[43:01] trying to fight with Thailand that was
[43:03] your bamboo curtain and when we finish
[43:06] the Beast who's rising up now
[43:09] is that complicated why did it happen
[43:12] only after we stopped preaching about
[43:15] the Pope here
[43:17] then what follow he opened up with the
[43:19] pole after we finish the whole trace of
[43:21] this Earth why did it happen like that
[43:24] it's not because of me
[43:26] the boss
[43:27] is giving enough instruction so that we
[43:31] cannot be deceived there is nothing new
[43:34] whatever the pope is doing we already
[43:35] have the blueprint
[43:38] in other words stay tight with this
[43:40] message
[43:41] it's homegoing time amen so pray for me
[43:45] we see the direction of the Holy Spirit
[43:47] how things will uh come up on the
[43:50] weekend amen glory be to God we have
[43:54] brought the same Mouse tonight
[43:56] he will be preaching our Thanksgiving
[43:58] message I learned how to pass the ball
[44:03] amen I learned how to pass the ball
[44:06] quickly amen I might be the one moving
[44:11] left and right or just pass it maybe
[44:13] he's going to shoot it so we can dunk it
[44:15] on Sunday
[44:16] if you know what I'm trying to say Amen
[44:18] so Brother Sam is the one having the
[44:21] ball tonight
[44:22] did it make sense I want to make it like
[44:25] that so you can really get what I'm
[44:27] trying to say Amen so we do not have
[44:30] visitors here tonight
[44:32] remember that we have family members so
[44:34] brother Aaron it's good to see you

[46:44] [Music]
[46:56] foreign
[47:04] God bless you
[47:09] appreciate you
[47:11] let's just turn our scriptures to Saint
[47:14] John 3
[47:16] 16. very familiar text very familiar
[47:19] text we want to talk tonight about the
[47:21] bridegroom's love
[47:24] I'll talk to you tonight about the
[47:25] bridegroom's love
[47:29] amen
[47:33] and Happy Thanksgiving
[47:37] I remember hearing brother Branham just
[47:38] recently says we ought to be thankful
[47:40] that he said I don't feel like we're
[47:42] thankful enough
[47:44] I don't feel like we're thankful enough
[47:47] just this one act in
[47:51] Acts 3 16.
[47:53] uh John 3 16 John 3 16.
[47:58] let's just read the word now
[48:00] for God so loved the world
[48:03] that he gave his only begotten son yes
[48:07] that whosoever believeth in him should
[48:10] not perish
[48:13] but have everlasting life
[48:16] now this is the key right here
[48:19] God sent not his son into the world to
[48:22] condemn the world
[48:24] that wasn't his purpose
[48:27] but that the world through him might be
[48:29] saved
[48:31] he that believeth on him is not
[48:34] condemned
[48:36] but he that believeth not is condemned
[48:39] already
[48:40] because he has not believed in the name
[48:43] of the only begotten son of God
[48:47] so then why then condemnation
[48:51] verse 19.
[48:53] and this is the condemnation
[48:56] that light is coming to the world
[49:00] and Men loved Darkness
[49:06] they love Darkness
[49:11] rather than light because their deeds
[49:13] were evil
[49:14] for everyone that doeth evil hateth
[49:17] light
[49:18] do you ever notice a cockroach
[49:23] bugs bugs of a feather
[49:27] go into it every time we go into hotel
[49:29] room go in and turn the light on if I
[49:32] see anything scary and we're out of
[49:33] there
[49:34] laughs
[49:37] it's true we haven't walked out of more
[49:40] than one hotel room
[49:42] for everyone that doeth evil
[49:45] hate at the light
[49:47] neither cometh till a light lest his
[49:49] deed should be reproved
[49:52] but he that doeth truth
[49:55] comes to the light
[49:57] that his deeds may be made manifest
[50:01] that they are wrought in God
[50:04] Lord Jesus we now are asking you humbly
[50:07] father
[50:08] that you would bless the reading of your
[50:10] word that you would anoint our lips to
[50:13] speak Lord God Lord God that you'd
[50:15] anoint the the hearers to hear Lord
[50:18] those that have a hunger in their heart
[50:21] Lord may they draw on the gift that you
[50:24] place Lord before the foundation of the
[50:26] world and Lord Jesus may you guide us in
[50:29] the direction that you would have us to
[50:30] go and Lord May at the end of the day
[50:32] May you get the glory the honor and the
[50:36] praise for Lord Jesus we can be nothing
[50:38] but like this microphone Lord if you
[50:40] don't do the speaking Lord nothing will
[50:43] be said that's worthwhile but Lord if
[50:45] you will come and do the speaking Lord
[50:47] then we'll all go home satisfied we'll
[50:50] all go home full and we'll all go home
[50:52] praising the worthy one the Lamb of God
[50:55] who took away the sin of the world thank
[50:58] you in Jesus Christ's name God bless you
[51:01] and you can be seated
[51:05] you know what the the last message that
[51:09] brother Branham preached on Thanksgiving
[51:10] day was
[51:15] it's the invisible Union
[51:18] he preached it in Louisiana
[51:21] amen amen and I'll never forget he was
[51:24] saying on there he said uh here I've
[51:27] preached almost I think it was a he was
[51:29] into the service almost uh towards the
[51:32] end of the last half hour of it and he
[51:34] said I haven't said anything about
[51:35] Thanksgiving he said but how thankful we
[51:38] should be how thankful the new Pilgrim
[51:40] fathers were when they came here and had
[51:42] the freedom to worship God that they
[51:45] wanted to the way that they wanted to
[51:47] so the invisible Union was expressed
[51:51] I believe it was in 1965 in November
[51:54] down in the Shreveport meetings amen
[51:57] amen well praise the Lord Jesus
[52:00] praise the Lord Jesus
[52:04] this little story just caught my mind
[52:07] and caught my well it was just something
[52:10] that it's a superhuman story but it was
[52:13] done by a human being and it happened in
[52:16] the 1968 Olympic Olympics has anybody
[52:19] ever heard of a man named awari
[52:22] from Tanzania from Tanzania and he was
[52:27] he was an Olympic runner
[52:29] and he was at the he was at the Mexico
[52:31] Olympics in 1968 and he was representing
[52:35] his country and he had a deep love for
[52:37] his country and he was he was quite an
[52:39] athlete apparently uh in in Tanzania he
[52:42] was one of the uh top Runners that they
[52:45] had and but when he came over to Mexico
[52:48] in Tanzania I guess that they don't have
[52:51] mountains and so he couldn't train in
[52:53] the high altitudes in Mexico cities in a
[52:56] very high altitude and so the air was
[52:58] thin and so it wasn't too long into the
[53:01] run that his legs started to cramp
[53:03] but he wouldn't give up he just kept
[53:05] pressing through pressing through
[53:07] pressing through and then on top of all
[53:09] that brother Stephen there was a little
[53:11] melee between the runners and all the
[53:14] runners kind of jostled together and and
[53:16] this man was thrown to the ground and he
[53:18] dislocated his knee
[53:22] he bruised his shoulder and he could
[53:25] barely uh keep going but that man ran it
[53:29] was a 26 mile race
[53:31] the accident happened at mile marker 11.
[53:35] of course they do it in kilometers but
[53:37] mile marker 11 he ran 15 miles
[53:41] on a dislocated knee
[53:45] and he would not quit
[53:47] I don't care what you're going through
[53:49] you don't have to quit
[53:51] we want to press the battle
[53:57] God's love is drawing us
[54:00] God's like us God's love got us this far
[54:03] and God's love is going to take us the
[54:06] rest of the way
[54:07] just relax
[54:13] I like the way brother Stephen puts it
[54:15] just put it in neutral
[54:19] his love is elective love
[54:22] I like what he said you can't mess it if
[54:24] you don't want it he's going to chase
[54:25] you down and give it to you anyways
[54:28] you say where is that in the Bible well
[54:31] let's look at uh Jonah
[54:33] he was running away
[54:36] did God chase him down
[54:38] brought him back
[54:39] he said boy you gotta go you've got to
[54:41] go
[54:43] he couldn't send anybody else brother
[54:45] Stephen
[54:46] it had to be Jonah
[54:51] it's right
[54:54] amen before the foundation of the world
[55:00] I remember reading in the greatest
[55:02] battle ever fought it's a quote that has
[55:04] stuck with me for years and years and
[55:06] years he said to he said you have to
[55:09] come to a place to where you keep your
[55:12] mind in the word and you doubt your
[55:14] doubts
[55:16] common yes
[55:18] yes if anything comes along and says you
[55:20] can't you just doubt that one
[55:22] if something comes along and says you
[55:24] can then you believe that one
[55:27] it's good to see you so bad we missed
[55:29] you
[55:30] amen
[55:31] imagine that devil trying to give our
[55:33] sister a fever shame on him
[55:39] I'll tell you Satan is cruel
[55:41] when you see what he does the little
[55:42] babies
[55:44] I don't want nothing to do with them
[55:47] and this message called Satan's eaten
[55:50] brother Brandon brings out this thought
[55:51] here he said I wanted to speak to you
[55:53] this morning to bring something to you
[55:55] to Enlighten you to the promise of God
[55:58] for this age
[56:01] now keep in mind this is priests in
[56:03] 1965.
[56:05] and I want to say it in a way that you
[56:07] understand what I'm saying and I'm not
[56:09] trying to make anything mysterious about
[56:11] it but the but the age that we're living
[56:14] in is beyond that
[56:17] what the what is being brought across
[56:19] this pulpit
[56:20] but by the entire fivefold Ministry
[56:24] brother Glenn Kelly bringing that
[56:25] beautiful message the other night about
[56:27] the the the Stone Cutters and the Masons
[56:30] and and how we need to have a stone
[56:32] cutter you can be the right Stone but
[56:34] there's still got to be somebody there
[56:35] to come in and Chip the stuff that's not
[56:39] Christ off
[56:42] you remember Michelangelo brother
[56:44] Stephen gave you that beautiful example
[56:46] that big block of marble that he was
[56:49] using and he he had to take his his
[56:51] chisel and his hammer and he had to
[56:54] knock off everything that was not Moses
[56:58] anything that was not Moses had to come
[57:00] off
[57:01] and I'm here to tell you tonight that as
[57:03] a child of God anything that is not
[57:06] Christ has got to come off and God's got
[57:09] a provided way to knock it off and
[57:12] that's the fivefold ministry I'm not the
[57:15] one that said that the fivefold ministry
[57:16] was given for the Perfection of the
[57:18] Saints
[57:19] I didn't say that
[57:22] but the scripture says that
[57:24] and brother Angela there's people that
[57:26] want to do away with the Firefall
[57:27] Ministry
[57:29] what are they gonna do
[57:31] and we can't and Eve got in trouble for
[57:34] just believing just one word
[57:38] they want to throw out a whole paragraph
[57:42] God help them
[57:45] something not something uh that somebody
[57:48] else was in another day but something
[57:51] when and them things is all right he
[57:53] says and we'll refer to all those things
[57:56] but I thought I would try to bring to
[57:58] your mind with these scriptures
[58:01] now keep in mind he's preaching Satan's
[58:03] Eden with these scriptures
[58:06] uh I got written here
[58:08] that would Enlighten you and make you a
[58:10] better soldier in the field that you're
[58:12] fighting in
[58:13] now now
[58:17] you wouldn't you wouldn't believe how
[58:19] many times that word now is just tucked
[58:21] right in there
[58:24] now are you the sons of God
[58:29] it doesn't yet appear where you shall be
[58:31] but we know
[58:33] that when he shall appear we shall be
[58:36] what
[58:37] for we shall what
[58:39] brother Angela's my microphone
[58:42] I'm only kidding
[58:45] we're gonna we're gonna be like him
[58:47] we'll see him like he is
[58:49] and I've always said it like this
[58:52] uh brother Polly carp when when when I
[58:55] see him I will see him in my mirror
[59:01] I will see him in my mirror
[59:04] damn it
[59:08] it's your character
[59:11] it's your man of walk
[59:13] it's your manner of life
[59:14] [Music]
[59:19] brother Brown said that the beauty of a
[59:21] church
[59:23] is the character of the people
[59:26] and I want to tell you something
[59:27] character is not a gift
[59:31] [Music]
[59:36] characters of victory
[59:39] and every trial that you go through has
[59:43] been foreigned by God
[59:48] before the foundation of the world
[59:52] her brother Branham and Lee Vale talking
[59:54] one time you remember this brother
[59:55] Stephen
[59:56] he's talking to leave
[59:58] apparently somebody had sent something
[1:00:00] to brother Branham and it was offensive
[1:00:02] not only to him but to his family and
[1:00:05] brother Lee looked at him said brother
[1:00:07] Brown how do you take it like that yes
[1:00:12] and brother Branham looked at Lee and he
[1:00:14] said oh lee he said that was a trial
[1:00:16] that was prepared for me before the
[1:00:19] foundation of the world
[1:00:22] you're in his hands
[1:00:26] we're talking about the bridegroom's
[1:00:28] love
[1:00:29] you're in his hands
[1:00:33] brother Stephen was talking uh before
[1:00:35] this before I came up and he said that
[1:00:38] uh one of the words that that he run
[1:00:40] into was beloved
[1:00:41] beloved and that was also used in that
[1:00:44] same text beloved now are you the sons
[1:00:47] of God
[1:00:49] now do you know that that word beloved
[1:00:51] comes from the root word of Agape of
[1:00:54] agape
[1:00:55] and the actual word for beloved is agape
[1:01:00] agape
[1:01:03] you're his dear little one
[1:01:12] are you ready for this
[1:01:14] are you ready for this sister
[1:01:16] that's why he hasn't given you the
[1:01:18] spirit of fear
[1:01:20] that's why we can look at him and call
[1:01:22] him Abba father
[1:01:25] a dear little child can look at her
[1:01:28] father and say Daddy
[1:01:31] and when you look at your daddy in the
[1:01:33] eyes and you ask him something just in
[1:01:35] just the right way you know especially
[1:01:38] you girls you know you're gonna get it
[1:01:42] girls got away with daddies
[1:01:47] Sunshine plug your ears
[1:01:52] so he wants to make us a better soldier
[1:01:54] in the field that we're fighting on now
[1:01:55] to learn the tactics of an enemy now
[1:01:58] this is very key here folks because we
[1:02:01] don't want to wrestle with the Enemy we
[1:02:03] want to block the punches keep them off
[1:02:05] us we don't want to keep falling and
[1:02:07] getting back up falling getting back up
[1:02:08] now I want to say this if you fall get
[1:02:11] back up
[1:02:13] but it's far better not to fall and not
[1:02:16] to have to get back up
[1:02:18] I would rather have a testimony that I
[1:02:20] never fell you sisters have got a
[1:02:23] testimony that you can hold true to it
[1:02:24] and you'll have a testimony that there's
[1:02:27] nobody else in this late to see an age
[1:02:28] will have
[1:02:35] we're talking about the bridegroom's
[1:02:36] love
[1:02:40] it's a no-nonsense love
[1:02:42] it's a pure love
[1:02:46] so you want to learn to keep the punches
[1:02:48] off you as much as you can
[1:02:51] he said no he said let's look a few
[1:02:53] minutes
[1:02:54] this great sinful day that we're now in
[1:02:58] he said I don't believe that there was a
[1:03:01] day that I ever read in history
[1:03:05] that there's been greater days of
[1:03:07] persecution
[1:03:08] when the children of God were put to
[1:03:10] death on every hand
[1:03:12] but the deceitfulness of the enemy
[1:03:16] we've never had a day like we're living
[1:03:18] in now it's the most cunning and
[1:03:21] deceitful day
[1:03:23] and when I see that it brings this it
[1:03:26] brings this
[1:03:28] and when I see that it brings this
[1:03:31] that the Christian has to be more on his
[1:03:34] toe
[1:03:36] than he ever was than he was and today
[1:03:39] than he was in any other age
[1:03:43] now he says back in the days of the
[1:03:44] persecution of Rome
[1:03:48] the Christian would make a mistake they
[1:03:50] would go down the arena they fed him to
[1:03:51] the Lions and he gave his testimony and
[1:03:53] he went to be with the Lord
[1:03:56] but now he says
[1:03:58] the cunningness of the devil listen
[1:04:01] closely
[1:04:02] the cunningness of the devil
[1:04:05] makes people believe that they're
[1:04:07] Christian
[1:04:09] when they are not
[1:04:18] November 19th no no I'm sorry November
[1:04:21] 29th
[1:04:23] 1973. can anybody count back that far
[1:04:29] a long time
[1:04:33] sister Teresa and another man
[1:04:36] walked into a creek
[1:04:39] was it Deer Creek Deer Creek
[1:04:42] in
[1:04:44] Pennsylvania
[1:04:46] it was two o'clock in the morning
[1:04:49] and I would just received the revelation
[1:04:51] of water baptism in the name of Jesus
[1:04:53] Christ amen
[1:04:57] and see back in 1973
[1:05:00] they were looking at 1977
[1:05:03] they were subtracting three and a half
[1:05:05] years off for the tribulation so 1973
[1:05:07] and a half they were out of here
[1:05:11] oh it's true
[1:05:13] so this guy is telling me you're going
[1:05:16] over to Germany November the 29th uh
[1:05:18] November 29 1973 I went overseas that
[1:05:22] same day
[1:05:24] the reason I got baptized at two o'clock
[1:05:26] in the morning is it was the last chance
[1:05:28] I had to be baptized and I didn't think
[1:05:30] there'd be somebody in Germany to
[1:05:31] baptize me
[1:05:33] so we went down into a cold Icy Cold
[1:05:37] Creek
[1:05:39] at two o'clock in the morning was
[1:05:41] baptized
[1:05:43] and I'll celebrate that what on the 29th
[1:05:46] of uh of November
[1:05:49] but it's never been the same since but I
[1:05:53] just want to say this it's been a battle
[1:05:56] it's a battle
[1:05:57] and you have to stay on your toes
[1:06:01] you can't give the devil one inch not
[1:06:04] even a whim and the the more that you
[1:06:08] can get tuned in I I just want to say
[1:06:10] this to you young folks you young folks
[1:06:14] when you when you come to this church
[1:06:16] don't come haphazard
[1:06:19] you come like it's between life and
[1:06:22] death like it's every word that's come
[1:06:26] because we're living listen to what the
[1:06:28] prophet said he said that this is the
[1:06:30] most deceitful age and Satan the devil
[1:06:34] has set every cunning trap that he can
[1:06:37] he's a Deceiver
[1:06:40] and Jesus told us in Matthew 24 how that
[1:06:43] this day that we're living in the most
[1:06:46] deceitful day that we've ever lived in
[1:06:49] so close he said it would deceive the
[1:06:52] very left if
[1:06:57] now we're talking about the bridegroom's
[1:06:59] love
[1:07:01] and the bridegroom's love is a known
[1:07:03] nonsense love
[1:07:06] now we've all been following the
[1:07:07] teaching on the Tabernacle
[1:07:09] and we know there's how many courts
[1:07:14] the outer Court
[1:07:15] spirit is the
[1:07:17] inner court and then there's the holiest
[1:07:19] of holy and that's your soul right
[1:07:23] how many senses control the outside
[1:07:24] Court
[1:07:26] okay when you're in this fight you gotta
[1:07:29] take those five and stick them in your
[1:07:31] hip pocket don't come to church with
[1:07:34] your feelings out on your sleep
[1:07:36] [Applause]
[1:07:40] we gotta move on
[1:07:43] [Music]
[1:07:44] and you have to forget your emotions
[1:07:48] your conscience your reasoning your
[1:07:51] memories remember what Paul said about
[1:07:52] reasonings does anybody remember what
[1:07:54] Paul said about reasonings cast out
[1:07:57] every reasoning
[1:07:59] and the thought that exalts itself above
[1:08:02] God
[1:08:04] cast it down we don't have time for pity
[1:08:07] parties
[1:08:09] we don't need to drag the man of God
[1:08:11] down trying to take care of us and nurse
[1:08:14] us and burp us and feed us a little
[1:08:16] pacifier
[1:08:20] I want to tell you I have been cut I
[1:08:23] have been ripped I have been torn to
[1:08:25] shreds since I've been in this church
[1:08:29] I'm talking about me
[1:08:38] but I'm not the only one
[1:08:42] but there's not one time that that razor
[1:08:45] came by that sword I'd pick it up and
[1:08:47] show you again but I did it last time
[1:08:49] that sword came by and cut something off
[1:08:52] of me that I didn't come back and tell
[1:08:54] the man of God thank you
[1:08:56] thank you
[1:08:58] thank you
[1:09:01] I want to tell you something when I pass
[1:09:03] from this world the way I go down the
[1:09:05] way the tree falls that's the way it's
[1:09:07] coming up
[1:09:08] and brother Branham taught us death
[1:09:09] don't change a thing
[1:09:12] [Music]
[1:09:16] if we're going to get rid of anything we
[1:09:18] got to get rid of it now
[1:09:23] and it's late
[1:09:25] the hour is late
[1:09:28] do you realize that time
[1:09:30] is blending into eternity
[1:09:36] not going to blend
[1:09:39] you know the Ephesian
[1:09:42] s Smyrna age and the Smyrna age blended
[1:09:45] into the pergameon age and the pergamine
[1:09:48] into the thigh Tyrant well I want to
[1:09:49] tell you something that time is blending
[1:09:52] into eternity
[1:09:57] the Bible said of the sounding of that
[1:09:59] seventh angel when he begins to sound
[1:10:02] the The Mystery of the time would be no
[1:10:06] more
[1:10:09] time will be no more
[1:10:12] it said the mysteries of God should be
[1:10:15] finished
[1:10:15] [Music]
[1:10:19] I remember back home
[1:10:21] there was a man of God hammering me on
[1:10:23] that
[1:10:24] he come to me he thought he was the
[1:10:26] eighth messenger
[1:10:27] he did
[1:10:29] still does I guess
[1:10:31] maybe he's the ninth by now
[1:10:36] this guy
[1:10:37] I I'm gonna I won't put his name out
[1:10:39] there but he was so vain brother Robert
[1:10:43] that he told his congregation that he
[1:10:45] helped God write the Bible
[1:10:51] do you see how how far off you can get
[1:10:57] and anyways he would hand me with that
[1:10:59] it says the mysteries of God should be
[1:11:02] finished
[1:11:03] and I said boy that doesn't sound right
[1:11:07] well you know I always felt like the
[1:11:09] King James version was wrong
[1:11:11] because it's it's not should be it would
[1:11:14] be and so you know when they wrote the
[1:11:16] new King James version you know what
[1:11:17] they put in there
[1:11:19] would be anybody got a King James
[1:11:22] new King James
[1:11:24] you got a new King James look it up uh
[1:11:27] uh uh Revelations 10 7 and see if it
[1:11:30] doesn't say would be
[1:11:33] I see we're gonna put it to the test
[1:11:37] that should be would be
[1:11:41] but they're actually not finished
[1:11:44] until they're revealed to you personally
[1:11:48] that's when the mystery is finished
[1:11:51] God can reveal it but until you receive
[1:11:55] it exactly it's not a finished product
[1:11:58] and when the mystery of God is revealed
[1:12:01] to you personally it will produce
[1:12:03] nothing less than the literal life of
[1:12:06] Jesus Christ
[1:12:08] if you've got a if you've got the
[1:12:10] Mysteries all figured out and you do not
[1:12:11] have perfect love go back again and try
[1:12:15] again
[1:12:21] what's it say
[1:12:23] does it say shouldn't be no
[1:12:26] no new King James
[1:12:30] the new King James
[1:12:32] okay anyways
[1:12:33] it does promise you
[1:12:37] and if not I got the Greek word on it I
[1:12:39] can prove it to you that way all right
[1:12:41] so
[1:12:49] amen
[1:12:52] thank you
[1:12:59] I wish I had that Clicker
[1:13:02] turned too many pages that's why I was
[1:13:04] lost all right so here we go so if we're
[1:13:06] living in the holiest of holies we're
[1:13:09] living by faith
[1:13:11] faith alone and faith has no reasoning
[1:13:13] to it
[1:13:15] and Proverbs 27 5 it says this it says
[1:13:18] an open rebuke is better than Secret
[1:13:21] Love
[1:13:23] say that brother
[1:13:26] I would rather a man just come right up
[1:13:28] and tell me straight up
[1:13:33] you know if people would tell me to my
[1:13:35] face the things they say behind my back
[1:13:40] and the things they say behind my back
[1:13:42] tell them
[1:13:45] behind me because I always come up and
[1:13:46] say nice things to you
[1:13:48] but then they tell the people behind
[1:13:51] your back the bad things well just come
[1:13:53] tell me the bad things and then say the
[1:13:55] good things about me behind my back
[1:13:58] do you see how the devil's got it so
[1:14:00] backwards
[1:14:01] if you've got something uh good to say
[1:14:04] to somebody
[1:14:05] then tell that to their friends
[1:14:08] and if you get something that's negative
[1:14:10] either go tell him or get on your knees
[1:14:12] and tell God
[1:14:16] then we'll start moving this boat down
[1:14:17] the road
[1:14:19] then we're going to be one big happy
[1:14:20] family
[1:14:22] because we're all going to have the love
[1:14:23] of God that's when we're all in
[1:14:25] I was I've talked so many times about
[1:14:28] this
[1:14:29] that if every person
[1:14:32] was perfectly lined up with Jesus Christ
[1:14:34] then we would be perfectly lined up with
[1:14:37] each other
[1:14:39] we don't need to try to imitate each
[1:14:41] other we need to keep Jesus Christ as
[1:14:45] our Focus
[1:14:46] from the littlest one to the to the
[1:14:49] oldest one from the from the sisters to
[1:14:51] the brothers we should all have one
[1:14:54] thing in mind the pattern is Jesus
[1:14:57] Christ the righteous
[1:14:59] [Applause]
[1:15:05] now I don't know why a public rebuke
[1:15:08] just a straight out rebuke
[1:15:11] has gotten such a bad name
[1:15:14] they used it in the Bible
[1:15:18] Galatians 4 11 to 12.
[1:15:22] it says but when Peter was come to
[1:15:24] Antioch Paul says I would stood him to
[1:15:26] the face
[1:15:28] because he was to be blamed that's right
[1:15:30] for before certain uh uh came from James
[1:15:34] he did eat with the Gentiles but when
[1:15:37] they were come he withdrew himself and
[1:15:41] separated himself fearing them that were
[1:15:43] of the circumcision
[1:15:48] right for everybody
[1:15:50] his Pals his rookies
[1:15:52] Peter you're wrong
[1:15:55] but this man was filled with the Holy
[1:15:57] Ghost Peter is filled with the Holy
[1:15:59] Ghost
[1:16:00] was there any resentment
[1:16:03] did you ever hear Peter complain to Paul
[1:16:05] Paul you shouldn't you shouldn't done me
[1:16:07] like that
[1:16:12] with my buddies
[1:16:15] let's look what Peter said
[1:16:17] in second Peter 3 15 to 16.
[1:16:23] Peter said an account that the
[1:16:25] long-suffering the Lord is salvation
[1:16:27] even as our beloved brother Paul
[1:16:33] sound like he had any hard feelings
[1:16:36] he called him his beloved brother I want
[1:16:40] to tell you something anybody that will
[1:16:43] rebuke me to the face and set me on a
[1:16:46] course closer to my Lord Jesus Christ I
[1:16:49] will call him my beloved brother
[1:16:53] can I say it like this just one time for
[1:16:56] the advantage of the little ones I don't
[1:16:58] care if a donkey tells me I'm doing
[1:17:00] something wrong I love the Donkey
[1:17:04] you won't find me kicking no donkeys
[1:17:07] telling me I'm in the wrong way
[1:17:08] [Music]
[1:17:13] [Applause]
[1:17:16] that one came straight from him
[1:17:22] I like it when he does stuff like that
[1:17:26] amen
[1:17:29] our beloved brother Paul also according
[1:17:33] to the wisdom given to him
[1:17:36] hath written unto you
[1:17:39] and also in all his Epistles speaking in
[1:17:43] them things in which are some things
[1:17:46] hard to be understood
[1:17:48] in other words it takes a little prayer
[1:17:50] life
[1:17:52] [Music]
[1:17:56] don't get mad at brother Stephen
[1:17:59] start praying look when the angel
[1:18:02] Gabriel came to Mary
[1:18:05] and she spoke something that was hard to
[1:18:07] be understood the angel spoke something
[1:18:09] hard to be understood
[1:18:11] what did Mary do
[1:18:15] you beat unto me
[1:18:17] and then she pondered it
[1:18:19] she mulled it over in her head
[1:18:22] she kept thinking about it kept praying
[1:18:25] about it friends let's pull together
[1:18:29] God is unveiling himself right here
[1:18:33] before our eyes
[1:18:38] his very nature his very character is
[1:18:42] being made
[1:18:46] and when we get to have it cook in a
[1:18:48] couple minutes we're going to find out
[1:18:49] that he made the vision playing upon the
[1:18:51] table
[1:18:58] oh my
[1:19:01] but now look
[1:19:03] we who are wise
[1:19:05] we will we will ponder them we will chew
[1:19:08] on them we'll go home and pray about him
[1:19:10] we will ask the Lord to help us to
[1:19:13] understand
[1:19:15] but they which are unlearned and
[1:19:17] unstable will wrestle with them as they
[1:19:20] do also the other scriptures
[1:19:23] unto their own destruction
[1:19:28] now keep in mind friends that we're not
[1:19:30] walking by sight
[1:19:34] our light is the light of Revelation and
[1:19:38] the light of Revelation is our faith
[1:19:41] expressed
[1:19:42] and faith comes by
[1:19:44] and hearing the
[1:19:47] I like this church
[1:19:50] and how can and how can he preach
[1:19:52] without a how can we hear without a
[1:19:54] preacher and how can he preach except
[1:19:56] that he'd be what
[1:19:57] thank God for God sent uh Pastor amen
[1:20:04] in Hebrews 11 27 Moses by faith forsook
[1:20:08] Egypt
[1:20:09] not fearing the wrath of of the king for
[1:20:13] he endured
[1:20:15] as seeing him who was invisible
[1:20:19] and now look when God the the
[1:20:22] bridegroom's love is a corrective love
[1:20:26] and if you're on the road wrong course
[1:20:28] the bridegroom is going to put you on
[1:20:30] the right course
[1:20:32] and sometimes he'll use very unusual
[1:20:35] ways to do it
[1:20:37] for instance there was a man named Saul
[1:20:39] one time
[1:20:41] and he was on the road to Damascus
[1:20:43] and he was going to persecute the
[1:20:45] Christians
[1:20:46] he was on the wrong course
[1:20:48] and so he had an intervention of divine
[1:20:51] intervention of
[1:20:55] can I say it
[1:20:58] can I say it
[1:21:01] the pillar of fire
[1:21:06] amen you talk about people wrestling
[1:21:09] unstable under their own destruction I
[1:21:13] read an article one person said that was
[1:21:15] a floodlight
[1:21:18] you don't put a floodlight that close to
[1:21:20] a man's head
[1:21:21] foreign
[1:21:26] [Applause]
[1:21:30] [Music]
[1:21:35] just because they don't want to believe
[1:21:37] the truth they love Darkness
[1:21:40] why don't they just love the truth
[1:21:45] that's why they'll be condemned
[1:21:51] I was leaving here Sunday in October
[1:21:53] Michael I said now I know why this gay
[1:21:56] agenda is going on
[1:21:59] Satan is trying to manifest In the Flesh
[1:22:01] what God is doing in the spirit
[1:22:09] he's just a perverter
[1:22:11] he ain't got no imagination
[1:22:14] so he'll take the plan of God put his
[1:22:17] little imp to it and he messes
[1:22:19] everything
[1:22:23] now that Spirit shouldn't touch any
[1:22:25] young people in this church
[1:22:27] it shouldn't touch none of you
[1:22:30] oh my God
[1:22:33] amen
[1:22:35] well after he had that experience
[1:22:38] you know God is a very wise God
[1:22:41] he really is
[1:22:42] because he wanted to get Saul's
[1:22:44] attention
[1:22:45] but he knew that Saul
[1:22:47] didn't have the Holy Ghost
[1:22:49] so he probably had a pretty vile temper
[1:22:53] so you know what he did
[1:22:56] I did him
[1:22:58] that man could get mad all he wanted to
[1:23:00] he couldn't do nothing about it
[1:23:03] right
[1:23:05] and then he sends him a prophet
[1:23:09] and the prophet prayed for him
[1:23:13] he gets the Holy Ghost but then God only
[1:23:16] gives him enough eyesight to where that
[1:23:18] he could read the Bible
[1:23:22] and he could compare his experience do
[1:23:24] you know that he spent three years in
[1:23:26] Arabia right right
[1:23:28] studying the word of God
[1:23:32] you get some people they get a little
[1:23:34] hiccup and they got the Holy Ghost
[1:23:36] oh I got the Holy Ghost bless God well
[1:23:38] where's your three years to go down and
[1:23:40] compare that to the scriptures and to
[1:23:42] come and make sure it was the Holy Ghost
[1:23:50] you ever seen him in a Pentecostal
[1:23:52] Church they come up behind him
[1:23:56] oh you got it
[1:23:58] all right please
[1:23:59] nonsense
[1:24:02] if your Holy Ghost does not produced a
[1:24:04] literal life of Jesus Christ just don't
[1:24:07] have nothing to do with it throw it away
[1:24:09] and wait for the real one to come
[1:24:12] when you can love your enemy when you to
[1:24:15] do good for them in despiteful use you
[1:24:17] when you can be long-suffering when a
[1:24:20] brother when he's wrong and you can bear
[1:24:23] along with him then you hold on to that
[1:24:25] Holy Ghost
[1:24:26] [Applause]
[1:24:30] if you're still getting yourself
[1:24:31] offended and having pity parties don't
[1:24:33] hold on to that one get rid of it
[1:24:36] you're just miserable and you're making
[1:24:38] everybody around you miserable
[1:24:45] God knows how to slow us them
[1:24:51] Paul recognized that being the Lord
[1:24:54] because he looked at him he said Lord
[1:24:56] who are you
[1:24:58] and then
[1:24:59] the Lord
[1:25:01] right up here
[1:25:03] the Lord
[1:25:06] the same one that led the children of
[1:25:07] Israel through the wilderness
[1:25:11] ah can I say it like this the same one
[1:25:14] that kept them Lions off of Daniel
[1:25:16] [Music]
[1:25:17] [Applause]
[1:25:19] [Music]
[1:25:24] Daniel and Darth seeing him that wasn't
[1:25:27] visible
[1:25:29] and friends you're going to endure as
[1:25:31] seeing him that is invisible
[1:25:34] [Music]
[1:25:35] look to the Unseen
[1:25:38] but don't try to figure it out
[1:25:47] God must reveal he must unveil he must
[1:25:51] pull back the cover
[1:25:52] [Music]
[1:25:54] and do you know what you have to do to
[1:25:56] get God to pull back the cover
[1:25:59] just ask ing
[1:26:01] just ask him Lord I don't understand
[1:26:06] lean not to your own understanding
[1:26:15] oh have a good conversation with God
[1:26:17] every day
[1:26:18] you got a question you got a problem you
[1:26:20] got a problem
[1:26:22] somebody in school bothering you
[1:26:24] have you talked to Jesus about it
[1:26:27] have you prayed for him
[1:26:31] amen
[1:26:35] it's hard not it's hard to preach behind
[1:26:37] brother Stephen
[1:26:39] it really is because you could get so
[1:26:42] many thoughts coming up he's already
[1:26:43] said it
[1:26:48] she's already said it
[1:26:52] but he don't have a copyright on it
[1:27:01] that's another one of the most
[1:27:03] dumbest things I ever heard
[1:27:05] is brother Branham plagiarize somebody
[1:27:09] and those same people are saying that he
[1:27:11] plagiarized reads the same books where
[1:27:13] brother Brandon gives credit to Uriah
[1:27:15] Smith and Dr Larkin and I read all them
[1:27:18] books in some places I could make it fit
[1:27:21] but there's other places I just can't I
[1:27:23] couldn't line it up and so I got to
[1:27:25] preach the way God shows me
[1:27:28] and then they want to come along and
[1:27:29] said he plagued your eyes
[1:27:39] yeah
[1:27:42] is God
[1:27:44] so anyways Paul
[1:27:46] was commanded to rise and go down to a
[1:27:49] street called straight and there was a
[1:27:51] prophet there whose name was ananias and
[1:27:53] saw a vision and he baptized him
[1:27:55] remember all him now he was a little bit
[1:27:56] skeptical about this guy
[1:27:58] he had to do a little praying himself
[1:28:01] he had to get a revelation that God was
[1:28:02] really in this
[1:28:04] he didn't want to go lay hands on just
[1:28:06] anybody any time he's a dead old boy
[1:28:09] might bite me
[1:28:11] right
[1:28:15] but when he prayed and God said he was
[1:28:17] one of his and he had no problem
[1:28:19] amen he got the revelation
[1:28:23] Hallelujah so Paul compared his uh his
[1:28:26] uh experience to the scriptures and we
[1:28:29] find that Paul the rest of his life had
[1:28:32] that for a typos
[1:28:35] so don't when you hear something come
[1:28:38] across as pulpit
[1:28:40] don't just go home and feel warm and
[1:28:42] fuzzy
[1:28:43] take it back into the world what else
[1:28:46] you got to do with your time
[1:28:52] what you got to do with your time
[1:28:55] what you doing with your time
[1:28:58] can I tell on myself one time
[1:29:02] this morning I was going through going
[1:29:04] back and forth between the Bible and The
[1:29:06] Message Bible and there was that article
[1:29:07] caught my attention and I stopped to
[1:29:09] read it
[1:29:11] and I got all done brother polycarp
[1:29:13] and I said man that's five minutes I
[1:29:16] could read first uh first Peter two or
[1:29:19] three chapters
[1:29:20] and I wasted my time reading that
[1:29:21] article now what did that I can't even
[1:29:23] tell you what the article was
[1:29:26] and it has no Eternal value
[1:29:29] [Applause]
[1:29:35] I want to ask you a question of your
[1:29:37] children to God
[1:29:39] are you a child of God
[1:29:41] are you a child of God are you a child
[1:29:44] of God
[1:29:45] amen
[1:29:48] then spend your time with Daddy
[1:29:50] [Music]
[1:29:50] [Applause]
[1:29:53] say with me in the beginning was the
[1:29:56] and the word was
[1:29:58] and the word
[1:30:00] and the word was
[1:30:02] and dwelt Among Us
[1:30:05] if I tripped you up I'm sorry
[1:30:08] but spend time with Daddy
[1:30:10] [Applause]
[1:30:13] you're the agapato he's the Abba he's
[1:30:17] the daddy he loves you he wants to solve
[1:30:22] your problems
[1:30:23] he wants to give you Faith where you got
[1:30:26] fear do you know there's no fear in love
[1:30:30] but perfect love casts out fear
[1:30:34] [Applause]
[1:30:42] so he studied
[1:30:44] and brother Branham said he had that as
[1:30:46] a tide post for the rest of his life he
[1:30:48] said what an absolute
[1:30:50] that was the end of all arguments
[1:30:54] that was the end of everything for Paul
[1:30:56] all strife
[1:30:58] everything was gone I don't care what
[1:31:00] the Pharisees said what the sadness he
[1:31:03] said or anybody else said
[1:31:07] he met God
[1:31:11] he met God
[1:31:14] Vindicated by the word
[1:31:16] that settled it
[1:31:20] that settled it
[1:31:24] let's apply the scripture test tonight
[1:31:28] what if the minister come up to you and
[1:31:30] rebuke you openly right in front of this
[1:31:32] whole assembly
[1:31:36] come on now yes
[1:31:39] yes could I could I just suggest this
[1:31:41] this is just me this isn't brother
[1:31:43] Branham I didn't read it anywhere else
[1:31:46] but your ability to receive corruption
[1:31:50] reflects your maturity
[1:31:54] [Applause]

[1:32:10] we need to get lined up quickly

[1:32:21] couple in the Bible named ananas and
[1:32:23] safiro

[1:37:20] [Music]
[1:37:24] all right
[1:37:26] every one of us were part of this
[1:37:30] don't you know that God hates the

[1:38:14] I said I don't think so
[1:38:17] there ain't nothing on a football game

[1:38:22] all excited about somebody with a blown
[1:38:24] up pigskin Throwing It All Over in the

[1:39:16] love

[1:39:23] um
[1:39:24] what's the word I want to use
[1:39:28] little measuring stick that I keep in

[1:39:56] Satan is the false accuser of the
[1:39:58] brother

[1:40:00] Satan is the one who will come and tell
[1:40:02] you you'll never make it if something is
[1:40:04] telling you you're never gonna make it

[1:40:58] him see how many of you want him to make
[1:41:01] the vision plain upon the table
[1:41:06] can we just knock that devil in the head
[1:41:08] once and for all can we just take all
[1:41:11] the trepidation out of his heart we're
[1:41:13] standing and we're asking you as a
[1:41:15] family please make the vision plain
[1:41:19] don't hold nothing back
[1:41:20] [Applause]
[1:41:23] thank you
[1:41:24] thank you
[1:41:27] that wasn't fresh from the throne I
[1:41:29] thought about that this afternoon but it
[1:41:30] was from the throne
[1:41:34] John says this he says love not the
[1:41:36] world neither the things of the world
[1:41:38] If any man loved the world the love of
[1:41:40] the love If any man loved the world the
[1:41:44] love of the father is not in him
[1:41:50] can I make that any clearer could John
[1:41:52] make that any clearer
[1:41:54] for all that is in the world is the lust
[1:41:56] of the flesh the lust of the eyes the
[1:41:57] pride of life it's not of the father but
[1:41:59] it's of the world
[1:42:01] and the world passes away
[1:42:04] and the lust thereof
[1:42:07] but
[1:42:09] he that doeth the will of the father of
[1:42:12] God abides forever
[1:42:15] now look at this curious little
[1:42:18] warning that John sticks in here
[1:42:21] little children little agapetos
[1:42:25] it's the last time
[1:42:30] he didn't say last times like the last
[1:42:33] two thousand years he said it's the last
[1:42:35] time amen
[1:42:37] do you see how brother Seth's message
[1:42:40] resonates all the way back
[1:42:43] they were expecting
[1:42:45] back then do you know how he knew it was
[1:42:48] the last time
[1:42:50] because they were Antichrist as you have
[1:42:52] heard that Antichrist shall come even
[1:42:55] now there are many antichrists
[1:42:58] whereby we know that we're in the last
[1:43:00] time
[1:43:01] now when that Antichrist went forth what
[1:43:04] horse rider was it
[1:43:06] the white horse rider
[1:43:13] and for all you people who think brother
[1:43:15] Brennan plagiarized
[1:43:17] Uriah Smith didn't get that right
[1:43:20] I'm just saying
[1:43:22] I'm just I'm just saying he didn't get
[1:43:23] that right
[1:43:24] that's why brother Branham couldn't use
[1:43:26] that because he couldn't make it fit
[1:43:30] thank you Jesus
[1:43:34] now the white horse rider
[1:43:36] came in flesh
[1:43:40] and the bride is going to the litter
[1:43:43] listen the literal Spirit of Jesus
[1:43:47] Christ it's going to be made flesh
[1:43:52] did I say is going to be I'm sorry is
[1:43:55] made is come in the flesh if that Spirit
[1:43:59] that's in you does not testify that
[1:44:01] Jesus is coming the flesh it makes you
[1:44:04] Antichrist
[1:44:07] it's not about what he's going to be
[1:44:09] it's what he is
[1:44:15] a question for you
[1:44:18] for use or do you love them
[1:44:21] if you love light you have eternal life
[1:44:25] if you love Darkness you condemned
[1:44:27] yourself
[1:44:33] now look at this here
[1:44:35] it says they went out from us
[1:44:38] because they were not of us
[1:44:40] for if they had been of us they no doubt
[1:44:43] would have continued with us
[1:44:46] but they went out but they went out that
[1:44:50] they may be made manifest that they were
[1:44:54] not all of us
[1:45:05] do you have that word for unctions
[1:45:09] it's an anointing
[1:45:11] the Greek word is charisma
[1:45:14] you've got a charisma
[1:45:19] you know you've got a Charisma yes
[1:45:22] that's where they get the word
[1:45:23] charismatic from
[1:45:25] but you've got the and it was uh it was
[1:45:28] a special Sab that was made by the high
[1:45:31] priest let me read it here I got it here
[1:45:34] uh
[1:45:36] it's usually prepared by the Hebrews
[1:45:38] from an old a a romantic herbs anointing
[1:45:44] was the inaugural ceremony for the
[1:45:47] priests the inaugural ceremony for the
[1:45:50] priests and you've got that unction now
[1:45:54] let's see what this unction does
[1:45:58] you've got an auction from the Holy One
[1:46:00] and you know all things
[1:46:08] am I reading a different Bible
[1:46:18] now that word for auction has only used
[1:46:19] two other times in the Bible and it's
[1:46:22] all in this same chapter
[1:46:25] let me read verse 21 real quick as we
[1:46:26] move along
[1:46:28] I have not given uh I have not written
[1:46:30] unto you because you know not the truth
[1:46:34] I have not written unto you because you
[1:46:36] know not the truth but because you know
[1:46:39] it
[1:46:40] and that no lie is of the truth now if
[1:46:43] you drop down to verse 27
[1:46:45] it says but the anointing that's that
[1:46:49] unction that's that charisma
[1:46:51] which you have received of him abides in
[1:46:56] you
[1:47:02] and you
[1:47:03] need not that any man teach you
[1:47:08] but the same anointing
[1:47:12] teaches you what
[1:47:15] of all things
[1:47:16] and his truth and is no lie and even as
[1:47:21] it have taught you you shall abide in
[1:47:25] him and now little children abide in him
[1:47:32] oh I pray God makes that a revelation to
[1:47:35] Every Soul in this building it will
[1:47:37] Revel now illusionize this congregation
[1:47:41] if you abide in him from the moment you
[1:47:44] wake up
[1:47:45] till you lay your head to rest
[1:47:48] and then you commit your sleep to him
[1:47:50] and you do that for the rest of your
[1:47:52] life he will lead you he will guide you
[1:47:56] into all light and Truth
[1:48:03] [Applause]
[1:48:07] and then when the minister stands here
[1:48:09] and says something that's a little bit
[1:48:12] hard to be understood you can go home
[1:48:15] and you can commune with that anointing
[1:48:20] foreign
[1:48:21] and that anointing that is in you will
[1:48:24] break it down break it down break it
[1:48:25] down and you sisters

[1:49:40] and not be ashamed before him at his
[1:49:44] coming
[1:49:51] that's worth its weight in gold yes
[1:49:54] put your anointing to work
[1:49:59] action to work
[1:50:01] I counsel you to buy of me
[1:50:04] tried in a fire
[1:50:06] and anoint your eyes with
[1:50:09] why
[1:50:11] so that you can see
[1:50:13] do you remember brother Brown telling
[1:50:15] the story about the Congress
[1:50:18] how his mama would come up there in the
[1:50:19] morning in that cold wind come across
[1:50:22] their eyes that means I woke up with
[1:50:23] what they call matter in your eyes you
[1:50:25] ever do that
[1:50:26] huh you got to go get some warm water
[1:50:29] and rub it out well she used Grease
[1:50:32] and that's how brother brown type this
[1:50:35] anointing
[1:50:40] if you know that he is righteous you
[1:50:43] know everyone that doeth righteousness
[1:50:45] is born of him
[1:50:48] now in a book called uh Corinthians the
[1:50:51] book of Correction
[1:50:57] few moments
[1:50:59] in this book of Corinthians in paragraph
[1:51:02] 15 he said if we notice
[1:51:05] he couldn't teach the Corinthians deep
[1:51:07] things
[1:51:08] they were just uh a baby fashion
[1:51:13] he couldn't go to them with a deep a
[1:51:16] great deep the messages like he did the
[1:51:19] Ephesians
[1:51:21] and he did to the Romans
[1:51:24] and teach them the Deep things
[1:51:26] because they wasn't able to take it
[1:51:30] how many
[1:51:35] my son proverbs 3.
[1:51:39] this is a beautiful proverb
[1:51:42] he says forget not my law
[1:51:46] I remember we are talking about the
[1:51:48] anointing and we are talking about
[1:51:51] the love of the bridegroom or the
[1:51:53] bridegroom's love
[1:51:55] okay watch now
[1:51:58] forget not my law
[1:52:00] but let your heart keep my Commandments
[1:52:05] I like how he says that my heart
[1:52:09] for length of days and long life and
[1:52:11] peace they shall add today let not mercy
[1:52:14] and Truth forsake thee bind them about
[1:52:17] thy neck and write them on the table of
[1:52:19] your heart
[1:52:20] so Thou shalt find favor and good
[1:52:22] understanding in the sight of God and
[1:52:24] man
[1:52:25] trust in the Lord with all your heart
[1:52:27] and lean not to your own understanding
[1:52:29] in all thy ways acknowledge Him and He
[1:52:33] Shall direct thy past
[1:52:36] be not wise in your own eyes
[1:52:39] but fear the lord and depart from evil
[1:52:46] it shall be held to your navel
[1:52:49] and Marrow to your bones
[1:52:52] on Earth the Lord with your substance
[1:52:55] and with the first fruits of all
[1:52:58] thine increase
[1:53:00] so thy Barnes
[1:53:02] so shall thy barns be filled with plenty
[1:53:05] and thy presses shall burst out with new
[1:53:08] wine
[1:53:10] we'll we'll just let that one go for now
[1:53:13] it's hard not to jump on him my son
[1:53:17] despise not the chastening of the Lord
[1:53:22] neither be weary of his Corrections
[1:53:27] when the Lord corrects you
[1:53:30] thank him
[1:53:34] you want to talk about having a
[1:53:36] Thanksgiving
[1:53:38] the biggest Thanksgiving day you should
[1:53:40] have is when the Lord corrects you
[1:53:54] for whom the Lord
[1:53:56] loveth
[1:53:58] he corrects
[1:54:00] even as a father the son in whom he
[1:54:03] delighteth
[1:54:07] now I want you to see something here
[1:54:10] Solomon ties Your Love or your ability
[1:54:14] to receive correction
[1:54:17] with wisdom
[1:54:19] yes
[1:54:23] the very next verse
[1:54:26] happy is the man that finds wisdom
[1:54:30] and the man that gets understanding
[1:54:35] what do we have to do to get wisdom and
[1:54:38] get understanding
[1:54:40] just ask
[1:54:43] you remember the parable Jesus was
[1:54:45] talking he said you being a father if
[1:54:47] your son asked you for a fish
[1:54:49] would you give him a serpent
[1:54:51] if he asks you for bread would you give
[1:54:53] him a stone
[1:54:55] then how much more will your heavenly
[1:54:57] father
[1:54:58] give
[1:55:00] the Holy Ghost
[1:55:03] which is the oil which is the salve
[1:55:08] to them who asked
[1:55:12] it goes on to say you have not been that
[1:55:14] because you asked not and he said ask
[1:55:16] that your joy might be
[1:55:19] ball
[1:55:20] overflowing
[1:55:25] habit cook too
[1:55:27] look at how have a cook
[1:55:31] a cook was a man that
[1:55:34] and so he puts himself up on the watch
[1:55:36] he said I will stand upon my watch
[1:55:40] I think we should stand upon the watch
[1:55:42] over our spirits
[1:55:45] we should stand upon the watch of
[1:55:48] our attitudes
[1:55:50] you know I found out I'm not supposed to
[1:55:52] judge somebody else's attitude
[1:55:57] um I'm supposed to pray for his attitude
[1:56:00] but there's one attitude that I'm
[1:56:01] supposed to keep a watch on
[1:56:08] and haven't cooked too long he says I'll
[1:56:10] Stand upon my watch and set me upon the
[1:56:13] tower that's the high place on the wall
[1:56:17] and we'll watch to see what he will say
[1:56:20] unto me
[1:56:22] and what I shall answer when I
[1:56:29] do you know what that word reproof means
[1:56:32] it means rebuked
[1:56:35] corrected
[1:56:38] it even means punishment
[1:56:41] it means chastisement
[1:56:46] but but but but we find out have a cook
[1:56:48] here he's on the town he's he's watching
[1:56:50] what he's going to answer
[1:56:52] when he's reproved
[1:56:55] and the Lord answered me and said write
[1:56:57] the vision and make it plain upon the
[1:57:00] tables
[1:57:01] that he may run that reads it
[1:57:04] for the vision is yet for an appointed
[1:57:06] time but at the end it shall speak
[1:57:11] you're not going to be ashamed when he
[1:57:14] comes it's going to speak you're going
[1:57:16] to have confidence when he comes
[1:57:23] it's going to speak
[1:57:25] pay attention
[1:57:29] now note here
[1:57:32] for the vision is for an appointed time
[1:57:33] at the end it'll speak and not lie
[1:57:35] though at Terry wait for it because it
[1:57:39] will surely come it will not Tarry
[1:57:42] now look at if you drop down to verse 14
[1:57:45] the Lord plugs it's about the only real
[1:57:48] positive thing in all of chapter two but
[1:57:51] he gives Abacus a little insight to the
[1:57:54] vision
[1:57:55] he says for the Earth shall be filled
[1:57:59] with the knowledge of the glory of the
[1:58:02] Lord as the waters that cover the sea
[1:58:06] apartment
[1:58:07] up here you applying yourself to uh to
[1:58:11] the Lord and you're going to find out
[1:58:13] that if you love a correction that you
[1:58:16] will you will find wisdom and down here
[1:58:20] you're going to get wisdom
[1:58:21] if you love to be reproved if you if you
[1:58:24] if you're waiting to see what you can
[1:58:25] answer when you're reproved then you're
[1:58:27] going to see the time that the Earth
[1:58:28] shall be filled with the knowledge of
[1:58:30] the Lord and the glory of the Lord uh
[1:58:33] will cover as the waters cover the sea
[1:58:37] now in this message call how can I
[1:58:39] overcome he said he wanted to take this
[1:58:42] subject how can I overcome because he
[1:58:44] said I think it's a time that we should
[1:58:46] never let the spirit of Revival die
[1:58:49] we've got to keep Revival almost almost
[1:58:53] finished now I just want to get through
[1:58:54] this and then we'll be all done but but
[1:58:56] this has got some real meat to it so so
[1:58:59] pay attention uh help me help me to get
[1:59:02] this out
[1:59:03] we've got to keep the spirit of we've
[1:59:06] got to keep Revival we constantly
[1:59:08] revived every day Paul said he had to
[1:59:11] Die daily
[1:59:14] amen amen this is every day this is that
[1:59:19] we don't take a vacation from God
[1:59:21] We Must Die daily
[1:59:26] that Christ could live
[1:59:28] we must never let the Revival die within
[1:59:31] us
[1:59:35] and he that overcomes will sit down with
[1:59:37] me in my throne
[1:59:39] as I've overcome down and set with the
[1:59:41] father in his throne he said do you
[1:59:43] notice the the arrangement of that he
[1:59:46] said set with me in my throne
[1:59:49] not on my throne
[1:59:51] in my throne
[1:59:54] okay Esther are you ready for this
[1:59:57] what did a hazardous give Esther
[2:00:01] the half of the Kingdom
[2:00:03] and I want to tell you something that
[2:00:04] didn't mean that she had the East half
[2:00:05] and he had the West half
[2:00:08] it meant that her word in that kingdom
[2:00:11] was just as good as his word
[2:00:17] and your husband has already said if you
[2:00:20] abide in me and my words abide in you
[2:00:23] ask what you will he has already
[2:00:28] stretched out the golden scepter to you
[2:00:31] [Applause]
[2:00:36] can you imagine God stretching out his
[2:00:39] golden scepter and a person walk away
[2:00:41] say I'd rather have my dark
[2:00:43] [Music]
[2:00:47] dog that said chills down my spot
[2:00:51] but they do it all the time
[2:00:58] Mercy
[2:01:02] see as Christ is a ruler the throne is a
[2:01:05] ruler at this time and the complete
[2:01:07] complete domain of God so will the
[2:01:10] church be with him the pride be with him
[2:01:12] in his throne in the entire domain not
[2:01:16] on the throne but in the throne sea
[2:01:18] where his domain reaches
[2:01:21] this domain is going to reach further
[2:01:23] than Esther's and I want to tell you
[2:01:25] something Esther's was pretty big
[2:01:28] but watch where your domain goes to
[2:01:32] you a throne is over a domain and a
[2:01:35] domain reaches just as far as its
[2:01:38] boundaries does
[2:01:39] and this is from eternity to Eternity
[2:01:44] just think of it
[2:01:51] he said but I come here for one purpose
[2:01:53] he said this is the House of Correction
[2:01:57] this is the throne
[2:01:59] this is the Throne of God now he's
[2:02:01] talking about the church
[2:02:03] he's talked about when they come into
[2:02:04] church
[2:02:06] okay
[2:02:08] and judgments go from the house of God
[2:02:13] and here's where we come together and
[2:02:15] gather in love with one another as only
[2:02:18] Christians can love
[2:02:22] but in here
[2:02:24] we are
[2:02:26] under a leadership
[2:02:28] of the Holy Spirit
[2:02:30] amen the Holy Ghost is amongst us
[2:02:32] and we're here to take Reckoning among
[2:02:35] ourselves to see where our short places
[2:02:37] are
[2:02:40] [Music]
[2:02:42] every time I come through that door I'm
[2:02:44] not listening for anything else but
[2:02:46] where am I missing the mark
[2:02:49] we know sin is unbelief but you know
[2:02:52] what sin means
[2:02:53] to miss the mark
[2:02:58] and that's why Paul had to strive for
[2:03:00] the mark of the high calling in Christ
[2:03:04] Jesus
[2:03:06] it's not going to come with a casual
[2:03:08] study of the word
[2:03:16] keep your mind filled with God
[2:03:21] shortcomings and how we should catch up
[2:03:24] where we should be or to where we uh
[2:03:27] ought to be now where we are and where
[2:03:30] we ought to be and that's what we study
[2:03:33] ministers study those places for their
[2:03:35] people and when they see the people lack
[2:03:37] they begin to work on that
[2:03:45] you know he was uh he he liked the
[2:03:47] Wilderness so he was out walking one day
[2:03:48] in an Old Creek
[2:03:51] and he saw a log
[2:03:53] pay very close attention
[2:03:56] when if you catch what he's saying here
[2:03:59] you will never come through those doors
[2:04:01] into this church the same way again
[2:04:06] pay close attention this is paragraph
[2:04:09] 41.
[2:04:12] um in how shall I overcome if you want
[2:04:14] to look it up yourself when you get home
[2:04:17] I was across an Old Log the other day
[2:04:19] down a wash
[2:04:20] or what is called a hollow
[2:04:23] and I jumped up on this log
[2:04:25] on the outset
[2:04:27] it looked good on the outside it looked
[2:04:29] good
[2:04:29] it looked like a big old beach log
[2:04:33] and when I've jumped on it oh my a great
[2:04:36] chunk fell off it it was real rotten and
[2:04:40] dirty I said that's the way Christians
[2:04:43] are becoming
[2:04:48] now watch watch why this log is getting
[2:04:52] old and dirty can't hold any weight
[2:04:56] and then he's going to explain why
[2:04:57] Christians are getting that way
[2:05:04] oh I read this and I just
[2:05:07] Lord I'll never come to church the same
[2:05:09] way
[2:05:11] of course I come expecting anyways
[2:05:13] brother Seth I know you're listening and
[2:05:15] I come expecting
[2:05:18] that was a Monumental sermon he preached
[2:05:21] that was one for the ages
[2:05:23] amen
[2:05:25] amen where are we at now
[2:05:28] the log old and dirty but when I jumped
[2:05:31] on a great big chunk fell off okay I
[2:05:34] said that that's way Christian
[2:05:36] they've been dead in central sin and
[2:05:38] trespasses so long till they become
[2:05:40] Dodie they can't hold no way at all they
[2:05:44] don't know what overcoming means and I
[2:05:46] begin to think of this text overcome
[2:05:51] comma
[2:05:53] keep life in you
[2:05:56] overcome
[2:05:58] keep life in you when the life went out
[2:06:03] that's what brought the law to that
[2:06:05] condition
[2:06:06] free fell
[2:06:09] but where did it fall it fell into the
[2:06:11] to the Stream
[2:06:13] he's going to type that to somebody that
[2:06:15] has no life in him and he comes and he
[2:06:17] sits on a Christian service day after
[2:06:20] day day after day doesn't pay attention
[2:06:23] let's see if that's what he says I was
[2:06:26] just a
[2:06:28] a quick summary for you
[2:06:31] that's the way Christians they've been
[2:06:32] dead it's interested so long till they
[2:06:34] become dirty they can't hold no weight
[2:06:35] they don't know what overcoming means I
[2:06:38] begin to think overcome let's keep life
[2:06:41] in you and the life went out and that's
[2:06:43] what brought the log to this condition
[2:06:45] and it made it worse than ever when it
[2:06:48] laid in the branch where the water was
[2:06:50] and then there you are you take a
[2:06:53] Christian that's supposed to be that's
[2:06:54] supposed to be a Christian
[2:06:57] in other words they got a testimony
[2:06:59] I'm a Christian
[2:07:00] I go to church I pay my tithes
[2:07:04] I read my Bible
[2:07:06] I pray
[2:07:09] but they don't have any understanding
[2:07:12] they don't have any thirsts
[2:07:14] they don't want correction
[2:07:16] they don't want to be told that they're
[2:07:17] wrong
[2:07:19] brother Branham said the reason that the
[2:07:21] that the Pentecostals wouldn't receive
[2:07:23] his message is because his message was
[2:07:25] corrected him and they didn't want to
[2:07:27] see themselves wrong
[2:07:30] so they died wrong and where are they at
[2:07:33] now
[2:07:35] how many of them would like to come back
[2:07:37] and have another chance to listen to
[2:07:38] brother Brown
[2:07:41] let the life go out from him the
[2:07:43] experience the joy of serving Christ and
[2:07:46] living in a church where such things is
[2:07:48] going on he'll rotten twice as quick
[2:07:51] right living right under so if we are
[2:07:56] trying to follow the message of the hour
[2:07:58] or at least part of the message we
[2:08:00] should live constantly in the life
[2:08:03] of Christ see because it don't if you if
[2:08:07] it don't you'll lay around and know and
[2:08:10] know that these things should that
[2:08:12] you're supposed to do and you don't do
[2:08:14] it and the Bible said he that knoweth to
[2:08:16] do good and doeth or not to him it is
[2:08:18] sin amen
[2:08:20] and then you become Dodie rotten then
[2:08:23] you separated from the life of God so
[2:08:26] strive with all that's in you to stay in
[2:08:30] the life of God the Life of Christ it's
[2:08:35] one thing to read the word but you want
[2:08:38] the life that was in the word to
[2:08:40] transpose itself into you that you would
[2:08:44] be fruit bearing we see this age that
[2:08:47] we're living in it's one of the grandest
[2:08:49] ages of old age all ages the land of sin
[2:08:52] Church age it's the grandest of all
[2:08:55] Church ages because it's the ending of
[2:08:57] time and the blending of Eternity
[2:09:02] and then he says it's the greatest
[2:09:05] sinful age
[2:09:07] it's more a more sin in this age than
[2:09:10] there's ever been the powers of Satan is
[2:09:12] many times harder to fight against than
[2:09:15] it was in any age
[2:09:17] here back in the early ages a Christian
[2:09:19] like he said could just give his life
[2:09:23] and that would be it
[2:09:26] but look what he says
[2:09:28] but the enemy now has come in the name
[2:09:30] of the church
[2:09:31] and it's so deceiving the great age of
[2:09:34] deception when Christ said so the two
[2:09:37] Spirits would be so close
[2:09:40] that would deceive the very elect if it
[2:09:43] was possible see see remember
[2:09:47] Christ spoke of an elected people for
[2:09:50] the last day
[2:09:52] it would deceive the very elected if it
[2:09:55] were possible
[2:09:56] so close the people live they the people
[2:10:00] so live the people can live a clean holy
[2:10:05] life
[2:10:06] not be sinful adulterers drinkers Liars
[2:10:11] gamblers they can live above all that
[2:10:15] and still not with it
[2:10:19] this is the age of life
[2:10:24] that's why I say the Thunders are not
[2:10:27] complete they are revealed but they're
[2:10:30] not complete until they're revealed
[2:10:32] personally to you and the new birth is
[2:10:36] the revelation of Jesus Christ
[2:10:39] personally to you
[2:10:43] that won't come with just a casual
[2:10:46] haphazard Church attendance
[2:10:48] that will come with a dedicated
[2:10:50] consecrated life
[2:10:52] when brother Stephen was talking about
[2:10:55] standing behind this pulpit
[2:10:58] it started to make me wonder
[2:11:00] do you realize that a man in the Old
[2:11:03] Testament that went beyond that Veil
[2:11:06] they had to tie a rope around his foot
[2:11:10] because if he stepped into this
[2:11:13] area here
[2:11:15] and there was something wrong with the
[2:11:16] way he was dressed
[2:11:18] or something that he had did and hadn't
[2:11:20] made right
[2:11:21] he would drop dead on the spot
[2:11:26] and they had little bells and
[2:11:28] pomegranates on the bottom of the
[2:11:30] Garment
[2:11:32] and when he would walk it would go holy
[2:11:35] holy
[2:11:36] holy
[2:11:38] and the only way that they knew that man
[2:11:41] was alive as they heard the bells
[2:11:49] and if they couldn't hear the bells
[2:11:53] pulled the Rope
[2:11:59] it's a fearful thing my sense my
[2:12:02] brothers my sisters to fall into the
[2:12:04] hands of a living God
[2:12:07] but I'm here to tell you tonight by the
[2:12:10] authority of Jesus Christ that this
[2:12:12] church is in the hands of a living God
[2:12:17] wake up take your part get on the front
[2:12:22] row start the whole front row should be
[2:12:25] filled with young people
[2:12:29] why would that God when I was your age I
[2:12:32] had a church like this to attack
[2:12:38] take advantage of it young people it'll
[2:12:41] deliver your soul and it will keep you
[2:12:44] from the most vile the most wicked age
[2:12:47] of all ages and they'll present you on

[2:28:58] but Kelly if somebody is outside tell
[2:29:01] them to get him
[2:29:04] you might be seated
[2:29:12] we all follow this sermon
[2:29:14] and the Holy Spirit is here
[2:29:17] and God spoke back and forth back and
[2:29:20] forth back and forth and there is no way
[2:29:23] you can listen
[2:29:26] God is speaking to four category of
[2:29:29] people
[2:29:36] tonight
[2:29:37] God is speaking to four category of
[2:29:40] people
[2:29:43] find where you are
[2:29:46] fix what you need to fix
[2:29:49] if not that's between you and God
[2:29:53] amen
[2:29:57] this is what I put down when I was
[2:29:59] listening to the sermon and it kept
[2:30:01] coming back over and over
[2:30:04] amen
[2:30:08] amen that's the chart ahead
[2:30:11] amen
[2:30:13] the first category God is speaking there
[2:30:16] is somebody that is resisting the Holy
[2:30:18] Spirit
[2:30:22] and that person is stubborn
[2:30:27] I'm just gonna tell you exactly what I
[2:30:30] receive and that's what I'm going to say
[2:30:33] there is a category that is resisting
[2:30:35] the Holy Spirit God is trying to help
[2:30:38] you
[2:30:39] and that category is stubborn
[2:30:42] and it's a category that is working on
[2:30:45] the pretense
[2:30:47] thinking that everything is right
[2:30:50] but it's not right
[2:30:54] amen
[2:30:55] this is the category that is thinking
[2:30:58] that Brother Sam is here to flatter me
[2:31:02] I'm just telling you what what came to
[2:31:05] me
[2:31:06] and whoever is missing in this church
[2:31:08] make sure you listen to what I'm saying
[2:31:11] listen to the sermon first listen to
[2:31:14] this it's a category that thinks that
[2:31:17] when brother Kelly preaches here he's
[2:31:19] just here to flatter me
[2:31:24] if you find yourself here you need to
[2:31:26] correct your stuff quickly before God
[2:31:28] deals with you
[2:31:30] the second category is somebody who has
[2:31:34] still stuff in his life
[2:31:36] has not cleaned up yet
[2:31:40] there are things that need to be taken
[2:31:42] off from your life
[2:31:44] and God is trying to move you from this
[2:31:46] bad side here
[2:31:48] to the other side
[2:31:51] amen
[2:31:52] these are people that have dropped under
[2:31:54] a religious spirit
[2:31:57] and they are here sometimes they're
[2:31:59] sleeping all the time
[2:32:03] open Zechariah Chapter 3.
[2:32:08] please
[2:32:11] I'm just going to tell you what I heard
[2:32:15] and that's between you and the Lord but
[2:32:17] we will pray for you if you want to
[2:32:19] change it
[2:32:23] Zechariah Chapter 3.
[2:32:28] laughs
[2:32:31] the Holy Ghost is not tolerating things
[2:32:34] anymore that's
[2:32:38] right everybody okay
[2:32:45] if you're there you can say a man
[2:32:47] Zechariah 3
[2:32:49] verse chapter 3 verse 1.
[2:32:53] the Bible says I'm speaking not to
[2:32:56] somebody who's here
[2:32:57] this person need to repent completely
[2:33:00] need to correct their life completely
[2:33:02] your attitude is wrong God would never
[2:33:05] do anything with you unless you correct
[2:33:07] it
[2:33:08] this person is in bad shape you got to
[2:33:11] stop what you're doing
[2:33:12] it's not helping you
[2:33:15] I'm talking to the person who is here
[2:33:19] Zechariah 3 verse 1 the Bible say and he
[2:33:24] showed me Joshua
[2:33:26] the high priest
[2:33:28] he didn't show Joshua The Sinner
[2:33:33] do you follow me Joshua is a high priest
[2:33:35] he's not a sinner on the street
[2:33:38] so it's a person and a religion
[2:33:41] the Bible said he showed me Joshua the
[2:33:44] high priest
[2:33:45] standing before the angel of the Lord
[2:33:49] and Satan standing at his right hand to
[2:33:53] do what to resist it
[2:33:56] how can Joshua be in the presence of the
[2:33:58] Lord
[2:33:59] him a high priest and Satan have the
[2:34:03] right to stand before God and to resist
[2:34:07] the man in the presence of the Lord
[2:34:10] what is in the life of Joshua
[2:34:13] that is giving the devil the right
[2:34:16] to keep accusing Joshua in front of the
[2:34:20] king
[2:34:22] are you getting what I'm saying I'm not
[2:34:24] talking about this category
[2:34:26] this category is getting things all
[2:34:28] backward
[2:34:30] amen they are preparing to always defend
[2:34:34] themselves
[2:34:36] amen
[2:34:38] they don't want to fall under
[2:34:40] the leadership not of my leadership but
[2:34:43] the leadership of the Holy Spirit
[2:34:45] amen I'm talking about this category
[2:34:47] here
[2:34:48] how can you stand in the presence of God
[2:34:51] are you a Son of God and the devil is
[2:34:53] walking in the presence of God and he's
[2:34:56] resisting you he's resisting you in
[2:34:59] front of God what do you have in your
[2:35:01] life
[2:35:04] that is giving Satan the right to resist
[2:35:08] you because God is your father
[2:35:11] Joshua is a high priest
[2:35:13] he's working for the king he's working
[2:35:16] for God
[2:35:18] but Satan doesn't feel God in the
[2:35:21] presence of God this is my job
[2:35:23] job God says that job there is no man
[2:35:27] like him this is Joshua where the Devil
[2:35:29] comes straight ahead in front of God
[2:35:40] such a boldness
[2:35:44] this is your second category
[2:35:47] verse 2
[2:35:49] and the Lord say unto Satan
[2:35:51] the Lord rebuked him or certain even the
[2:35:55] Lord that has chosen Jerusalem rebuked
[2:35:58] him he's not this a brand plugged out of
[2:36:01] fire
[2:36:02] God is rebuking the devil do you see any
[2:36:06] changes
[2:36:09] this is the category that we will
[2:36:12] continue to pray Deliverance will not
[2:36:15] happen
[2:36:19] you will come
[2:36:21] with problem we'll pray
[2:36:23] and you might feel better here when you
[2:36:26] go out the problem comes back again
[2:36:30] there is a key why the devil is
[2:36:33] resisting Joshua
[2:36:35] what is in Joshua life
[2:36:38] that is giving the devil such a boldness
[2:36:41] until God himself have to rebuke the
[2:36:44] devil
[2:36:46] this is what it is
[2:36:48] verse 3 now Joshua
[2:36:50] was clothed with the Priestly garment
[2:36:56] what kind of government did he have
[2:36:58] that's the reason why the devil have a
[2:37:02] right to resist you in the presence of
[2:37:05] God
[2:37:06] he has a right to call you a liar in
[2:37:08] front of God
[2:37:11] do you follow me
[2:37:12] amen there is something in your life
[2:37:15] that Brother Sam say here not Brother
[2:37:18] Sam the Holy Spirit you must take off
[2:37:20] from your closet
[2:37:23] that filthy garment and you gotta burn
[2:37:25] it
[2:37:26] you gotta take those high-heeled shoes
[2:37:28] whoever is listening I know some of you
[2:37:31] are not here
[2:37:32] whoever is online whoever is back home
[2:37:35] whoever is going to listen later you
[2:37:37] have something in your house maybe a
[2:37:40] book that need to be burned
[2:37:44] maybe you have a skirt that needs to be
[2:37:46] burned
[2:37:48] maybe you have polish now we already
[2:37:51] preach about Nails we already preach
[2:37:54] about all these stuff uh I mean uh
[2:37:56] through the hotel you still holding on
[2:37:59] to those stuff that's why the devil have
[2:38:02] a right no matter how much we're gonna
[2:38:04] pray the devil will have the right to
[2:38:06] still continue coming and Buffet you all
[2:38:09] the time because there is something in
[2:38:11] your life that you need to take off if
[2:38:14] it's the nail taken off
[2:38:16] if it's your high he'll take him off if
[2:38:18] it's your conversation or your friend
[2:38:20] get them out
[2:38:24] do you follow me if not you will
[2:38:27] continue to sleep in this church
[2:38:30] you will continue as soon as the sermon
[2:38:32] started you will be starting to sleep
[2:38:34] because you don't want to give up
[2:38:36] something
[2:38:37] you don't want to take something out of
[2:38:39] your life that is a blockage that the
[2:38:41] Holy Spirit have already revealed to you
[2:38:44] through the word that this is wrong you
[2:38:47] don't want to do it you don't want to
[2:38:49] come to church you don't want to give
[2:38:50] God the preeminence continue it's not
[2:38:54] going to change I will continue to pray
[2:38:56] but the devil has a right to stand
[2:38:58] before you in the presence of God and
[2:39:01] resist you
[2:39:02] until this thing is taken out verse 4
[2:39:07] and he answered verse three now Joshua
[2:39:10] was clothed with filthy garment that's
[2:39:12] the reason why the devil have a right
[2:39:14] and stood before the water how do you
[2:39:17] come in church with what you're wearing
[2:39:19] whether you're a man or whether you're a
[2:39:22] woman
[2:39:25] why
[2:39:27] the Bible say verse 4 and he answered
[2:39:29] and spoke unto those that stood before
[2:39:31] him saying do what
[2:39:34] as long as that government is there
[2:39:38] the devil have a right on you your
[2:39:41] haircut have a spirit
[2:39:45] the way you are grooming yourself
[2:39:47] whatever you want to copy with the
[2:39:50] fashion today you are bringing a spirit
[2:39:52] on you
[2:39:53] whatever you're wearing young sister you
[2:39:57] are bringing a spirit
[2:39:58] whatever you're bringing in your house
[2:40:00] you are bringing a spirit that's why the
[2:40:04] devil have a right go clean up your
[2:40:06] house clean your closet up clean your
[2:40:09] shoes
[2:40:12] I can even go deeper clean your
[2:40:14] underwear
[2:40:17] I'm talking to this church and I'm
[2:40:19] responsible for this church clean up
[2:40:21] everything that is bad
[2:40:26] everything that have the appearance of
[2:40:28] evil that doesn't reflect you as a
[2:40:31] Christian that doesn't make you look
[2:40:33] like a respectable young man or a
[2:40:36] respectable young woman take it off
[2:40:39] burn it amen battling depression
[2:40:42] battling trouble look what you have
[2:40:46] why is this church not filled tonight
[2:40:49] because everybody's working
[2:40:52] if I take you to people's home all of
[2:40:54] them that are home are working
[2:40:57] not all of them are working some a guy
[2:41:00] used they can sit home and watch and
[2:41:02] stream and probably they won't stream
[2:41:03] now they're going to stream when they
[2:41:04] get a chance
[2:41:07] some are working and they're trying
[2:41:09] their best to be putting stuff there
[2:41:12] some have legitimate reason there is
[2:41:14] everybody that is not here having a
[2:41:16] legitimate reason no
[2:41:19] continue
[2:41:21] I will continue to pray
[2:41:23] but that setting have a right until you
[2:41:27] take the filthy garment off the Bible
[2:41:29] says verse 4 and he answered and spake
[2:41:32] unto those
[2:41:33] that stood before him saying take away
[2:41:36] the filthy garment from him and unto him
[2:41:39] he said behold I have caused that what
[2:41:42] what is Iniquity
[2:41:45] you know that already you just don't
[2:41:48] want to do it there is Iniquity in
[2:41:50] somebody else's life that doesn't want
[2:41:53] to let it go
[2:41:58] that's why they tell you burn it
[2:42:04] amen iniquity to pass from thee and I
[2:42:08] will clothe thee with a change of water
[2:42:10] you need the Holy Ghost
[2:42:12] God is speaking to you for one more time
[2:42:17] get that thing out of your life
[2:42:20] get that friend out of your life
[2:42:22] whatever you clinging to take that out
[2:42:26] of your life so God can move you from
[2:42:28] this category here
[2:42:29] to another category that I'm about to
[2:42:32] speak
[2:42:36] whoever is not here tonight
[2:42:38] go back and listen to what I'm saying
[2:42:41] and find yourself where you are
[2:42:45] and fix your life
[2:42:48] the third category is somebody who is
[2:42:52] already receiving the word
[2:42:55] amen they are already respecting the
[2:42:58] word
[2:42:59] amen
[2:43:01] God is encouraging you tonight
[2:43:04] Amen to dedicate your life more
[2:43:08] because he's about to fill you
[2:43:12] open
[2:43:14] John
[2:43:17] first John chapter 3 where Brother Sam
[2:43:20] was reading
[2:43:30] if you think I'm too blunt I can speak
[2:43:33] more than what I'm talking
[2:43:36] oh
[2:43:38] yeah make a plane yes
[2:43:40] if a spirit doesn't want to leave there
[2:43:42] is a reason why that spirit is hanging
[2:43:47] some only like God when they go to
[2:43:49] trouble
[2:43:50] when there is no trouble they won't come
[2:43:57] first John chapter 2
[2:44:00] and then we wind up quickly verse 19.
[2:44:04] the Bible said they went out from us
[2:44:08] but they were not of us
[2:44:13] you there
[2:44:15] on Sunday
[2:44:17] we talked about the Holy Spirit
[2:44:20] being one spirit
[2:44:23] you remember that
[2:44:24] and then we divided it like this just to
[2:44:28] give you an idea
[2:44:29] and we say this is the portion
[2:44:32] that belonged to the brother
[2:44:35] everybody okay and in this portion we
[2:44:38] got load of portion because the Bible
[2:44:41] Paul said that he give to everyone
[2:44:43] according to the measure of the gift of
[2:44:46] Christ there is a measure that is given
[2:44:48] up Christ is the only one that received
[2:44:50] the spirit with that measure
[2:44:52] every one of us we're receiving by
[2:44:55] portion based on what was already
[2:44:57] predestinated in the body of Christ
[2:45:00] because this even though it's a circle
[2:45:02] this is the head
[2:45:04] and this one is the body
[2:45:07] amen there is a portion that owes that
[2:45:10] is already appropriated or or
[2:45:12] predestinated to fill the body if you
[2:45:16] are a member of this body you are the
[2:45:18] Beloved the call the Church of God the
[2:45:21] wife of God the children of God the
[2:45:23] Beloved all those names that I gave on
[2:45:25] Sunday there is something for you here
[2:45:27] that you need to feel that's why David
[2:45:29] said
[2:45:32] do what to make up
[2:45:35] fill my cup and tell you what it runs
[2:45:37] over so there is a cup for David
[2:45:40] he have a measure
[2:45:44] the Bible says this that day went out
[2:45:48] from us there is somebody that left
[2:45:50] but they were not of us
[2:45:54] this body here Lord's willing maybe on
[2:45:56] Sunday it is called the US
[2:46:02] amen so the reason why somebody is
[2:46:05] living John is saying because in God
[2:46:09] they were not there to begin with
[2:46:12] there is nothing for that there is no
[2:46:15] representation of them that's the reason
[2:46:17] why they are living
[2:46:22] they went out from us but they were not
[2:46:25] of us for if they had been of us
[2:46:29] everybody there
[2:46:30] were no doubt as what
[2:46:33] continue with water because the more you
[2:46:35] were bad somehow the holy spirit will
[2:46:38] come one day and will fill you
[2:46:40] you will not leave
[2:46:44] the Bible continue he said but they went
[2:46:46] out that they might be made manifest
[2:46:49] that they were not of all of water they
[2:46:53] were among us but according to the Plan
[2:46:56] of Redemption they don't have any
[2:46:58] representation in God so they will come
[2:47:00] a time where separation have to happen
[2:47:03] but verse 20 ye have an option from the
[2:47:08] Holy One and you know what
[2:47:10] job to verse 24 let that therefore a bad
[2:47:14] in you which ye have heard from the
[2:47:17] water
[2:47:17] what was in the beginning
[2:47:20] in the beginning was the water that word
[2:47:23] was that logos over there now but John
[2:47:26] is saying that dialogue that you heard
[2:47:28] from the beginning look what it's gonna
[2:47:30] do the Bible said let that therefore
[2:47:33] abide in you
[2:47:35] amen which ye have heard from the what
[2:47:38] from the beginning if that which he have
[2:47:41] heard from the beginning shall remain in
[2:47:44] water your portion of the holy spirit
[2:47:46] amen ye also shall continue in the and
[2:47:51] in the water because the Son and the
[2:47:53] father are water that's the reason why
[2:47:55] the holy spirit will remain on you
[2:48:00] verse 25 and this is the promise that he
[2:48:04] has promised us
[2:48:06] even water
[2:48:08] why because you were already have
[2:48:10] eternal life here
[2:48:14] amen the promise is up to you and to
[2:48:18] your children and as many as the Lord
[2:48:21] those call are here
[2:48:27] that's why the Bible say in the book of
[2:48:28] Acts those that were ordained to eternal
[2:48:31] life you must be ordained to eternal
[2:48:33] life if you are ordained to eternal life
[2:48:36] somehow you will receive eternal life
[2:48:39] for certain amen verse 26 these things
[2:48:42] have I written unto you concerning them
[2:48:45] that seduce you God
[2:48:49] the anointing which he has received
[2:48:52] of him you are receiving from that from
[2:48:56] him
[2:48:57] you are born here what you call your
[2:49:00] birthday you are here your Genesis 2 7
[2:49:04] amen but you are receiving something
[2:49:07] from him
[2:49:08] amen that which you received from him
[2:49:13] amen but the anointing which he have
[2:49:16] received of him do what
[2:49:19] that's why Paul said you are still until
[2:49:22] he cannot leave you he was a portion
[2:49:25] that was prepared for you he have your
[2:49:28] name
[2:49:29] and that name is not your name given to
[2:49:31] the father but it's the name of the
[2:49:34] Revelation that's why the new birth is a
[2:49:36] personal revelation of Jesus Christ
[2:49:40] there is a revelation that will unfold
[2:49:42] to you and bring the Holy Spirit into
[2:49:44] you and the Holy Spirit will never leave
[2:49:46] you
[2:49:47] because it's a seal God is telling you
[2:49:50] that you are my child you always be my
[2:49:53] child I'm just coming to confirm to you
[2:49:56] that before the foundation of the world
[2:49:58] you were my son already
[2:50:04] verse 27 but the anointing which you
[2:50:07] have received of him abideth in you and
[2:50:10] ye need not that any man do what that's
[2:50:13] why brother Branham said the holy spirit
[2:50:15] is in his sad teacher he's the one when
[2:50:18] we are preaching here somebody is there
[2:50:20] with you he's giving you more scripture
[2:50:23] more code more scripture more God I'm
[2:50:25] saying one thing but he's telling you
[2:50:28] like he's kind of because the Bible say
[2:50:31] he will bring in what and remember
[2:50:34] that's why you are sitting on Sunday you
[2:50:37] are listening to the sermon you see
[2:50:39] scripture coming back to your memory the
[2:50:42] one who's remanding you the scripture is
[2:50:44] the Holy Ghost
[2:50:46] and when he reminds you it seems like
[2:50:49] you understand it more better than
[2:50:51] before because he is the inside teacher
[2:50:57] the Holy Ghost is not complicated
[2:51:00] people made it complicated
[2:51:02] [Music]
[2:51:05] oh God I'm not going to preach on Sunday
[2:51:07] message here but the anointing which you
[2:51:10] have received of him a by death in you
[2:51:13] and you need not that any man teach you
[2:51:17] but as the same anointing do what
[2:51:20] of water
[2:51:25] I can go through many scriptures the
[2:51:27] Bible said they will all be taught of
[2:51:29] God
[2:51:30] and they all are the children of God and
[2:51:33] the Bible continues he say all things is
[2:51:36] the truth and is no water and even as he
[2:51:40] has taught you you shall do what
[2:51:42] there is no way you can depart from God
[2:51:46] because that anointing will stabilize
[2:51:48] you he will put an ankle on you until
[2:51:51] you look like Peter you say to whom
[2:51:53] shall we go because you only have the
[2:51:56] word of what
[2:51:57] eternal life
[2:51:58] all right
[2:52:01] somebody is already respecting the word
[2:52:04] somebody's already sucking he's already
[2:52:06] testing for the word
[2:52:08] consecrate just a little to be
[2:52:10] surrendered
[2:52:12] stay awake when we're preaching because
[2:52:15] the devil is troubling you so you don't
[2:52:17] he doesn't want you to get the word
[2:52:19] that's why he make you sleepy all the
[2:52:22] time so you can miss it
[2:52:25] because he knows that the word of life
[2:52:30] go to James chapter one
[2:52:32] come on Jesus amen

[2:53:35] gift and every perfect gift from water
