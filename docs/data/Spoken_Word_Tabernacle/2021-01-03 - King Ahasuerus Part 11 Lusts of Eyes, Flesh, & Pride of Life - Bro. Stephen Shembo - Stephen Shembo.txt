this morning okay [Music] blessed be the name of the lord can anybody hear me everybody hear me okay praise the name of god hallelujah everybody ready we're in a war yeah the devil is mad but we are also mad amen thank god for the cross he has been fighting left and right getting this one sick this one seek this problem this problem this problem but through it all we learn to trust in jesus amen blessed be the name of the lord brother branham was speaking about the bailor brother branham say that i was told one time that over the baylor there was a fellow went over to get him a job how many knows that story okay let me read it again the name of the lord brother branham said that but i was told one time that over at the baylor and ballards there was a fellow went over to get him a job and they asked him to sign his name to the paper and when he went to sign his name he did not have an eraser on the end of the pencil you know that story and the man told him you have no eraser he said well i don't make a mistake i don't make any mistake and mr beller say then i can't use you you ain't going to do nothing so i think that's about right if we don't make mistake we not been doing anything but what i like about a person is that when you make a mistake a real soldier is ready to rise and try again there used to be a little song that we sing so we're going to reach perfection one of this day when we're going to have the change of the body but as long as we are in this tabernacle right here which is waiting for redemption we are still subject to make mistake so if you got a pencil in this church make sure at the end of your pencil you got an eraser when you make a mistake don't be shy don't run away from the church just come back and then we're going to use that eraser and we're just going to raise it with the blood of jesus christ and we're going to continue amen blessed be the name of the lord let's go to our scripture this morning it might be a little bit heavy so you need to stay a little bit alert we appreciate everybody online thank god we have an opportunity to still tune in the service regardless of what the devil was trying to do amen genesis chapter 28. am i go slower but it's loaded genesis 28 if you dare you can say amen we're picking up from last thursday verse 10 and jacob went out from beersheba and went toward aaron amen this sees jacob leaving his father home going to his uncle lebanon and he lighted upon a certain place and tarried there all night because the sun was set and he took off the stones of that place and put them for the for his pillows and lay down in that place to sleep you might be seated and he dreamed in that place where he put up the stone for pillows and he dreamed and behold a ladder set up on the earth amen and the top of it reached to heaven and behold the angels not only one angel but it's several angels not only one and the angels of god are sending thank you and descending on it so on the dream of jacob in this specific place jacob went to sleep but what he noticed that the angels of the lord were ascending and descending upon that specific space amen and behold the lord stood above it above the ladder and say i am the lord god of abraham your father and the god of isaac the land where on you lie to you will i give it and to your seed and your seed shall be as the dust of the earth in other words the same promise he gave to abraham and you shall spread abroad to the west and to the east and to the north and to the south everything he gave to abraham and in you and in your seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed the same abrahamic promises and behold i am with you and will keep you in all places wherever you go and will bring you again into this land for i will not leave you until i have done that which i have spoken to you of you amen so jacob is departing from the promised land as he is departing from the promised land he reached a place where there was many stones he pick up certain stones and he lay on the stone but in that space that we gonna see that place is called bethel in that space there was something that was unfolded to jacob the angels of the lord were ascending and descending amen and god told him that you're going toward the journey and you're going to come back but when you come back you're going to come back to this place this place started the journey of jacob started with a place where the angels of god were ascending and descending everybody clear so far verse 16 and jacob awakened out of sleep and he said surely the lord is in this place and i knew it not so god was in that place and god unfolded a certain ministry and in that ministry the angels were ascending and descending upon a ladder everybody clear verse 17 and he was afraid and say how dreadful is this place this is no other but the house of water so the house of god is the name of bethel amen this is the house of god and this house when it started there is a descending and the ascending of the angels of god everybody again and this is the gate of water this is the door to the heaven amen in other words that door jesus said he was the gate he was the door so in other words jacob met christ amen and the ministry of christ in that specific spot was a ministry where the angels were ascending and descending upon christ hallelujah amen verse 18 and jacob rose up early in the morning and took what not once not three stones there was only one amen he took this stone did you see that not a stone by this stone amen this stone that he had put for his water so there was a stone there that jacob put for his pillow and that stone had a mystery amen and set it up for a pillar it was a pillow before now it's a pillar and pour oil upon the top of it amen so that stone was anointed amen in battle there is a stone amen in that stone the angels of the lord ascend and descend upon that stone everybody clear and that stone will be anointed [Music] hallelujah verse 19 and he called the name of that place water the house of god that is crushed amen the stone amen but the name of that city was called lose at the first everybody clear i'm just gonna give you this for a background let's go to genesis 31 amen keep that quote i gave you in mind genesis 31 verse 11. this is jacob went he's living with leban the syrian verse 11 and the angel of god spoke to me in a dream saying jacob and i say hear a man he am i and he said lift up now your eyes and see all the ramps which leap upon the caddo are weighing strict sparkle and grizzled for i have seen all that lebron does to you jacob was under 11 and laban keep cheating him left and right amen i am the god of water so he begin to remind him about a ministry he begin to remind him about the beginning remember where you started just like the church started and god said remember from where you fall remember from where you started remember bethel everybody clear i am the god of bethel where you did water anointed the pillar he reminded him about that anointed ministry where the angels of god were ascending up and down amen and where you vow a vow to me now eras get you out from this land and do what and return to the land of water in other words go back again to bethel everybody clear let's jump to verse 17. then jacob rose up and set his sons and his wife upon camels and he carried away all his cattle and all his goods which he had gotten the cuddle of his getting which he had got an independent pen and aaron for to go to isaac his father in the land of canaan and lebanon went to shear his ship and rachel had what stolen the images that were her fathers so god is telling jacob depart from here you left the battle you went through a journey now i want you to go back again to better but as they're going back to better rachel took the images or the gods of her father and carried them back again amen verse 20 and jacob stole away unawares to lebanon the syrian in other words he left without telling him in that he told him not that he did what he fled everybody cleared so far now let's go to genesis 35. and i want to remind you that at this point joseph was already born amen joseph was already born joseph was born before rachel steals the god amen genesis 35 and god said to jacob verse 1 arise and go up to water go back again to the ministry amen he started with that ministry but he need to go back again to the ministry let me help you up when he started that was the beginning of his journey the beginning of his journey is the offer of his journey anybody clear and god is telling him go back again but as he's going back he's not going back as alpha but he's going back as omega but alpha and omega are the same thing it is still the same place [Applause] erase go up to better and dwell there and make there a water and alter to god a church is going to be birthday that appeared to you when you did what fled from the face of esau your brother that a malacat anybody there then jacob when this message came this message that is bringing him back to better amen then jacob said to his household and to all that were with him put away water so there was a purging of those gods anybody clear the gods were packed but before going back to the full restoration a message came and that message helped purge the gods that were in the house of la of jacob put away the strange god that are among you including that which rachel storm we got it now so that curse is going to be removed with a message that sends you back to bethel strange god that are among you and be clean and change your garments and let us arise and go up to water and i will make there an altar to the god who answered me in the day of my distress and was with me in the way which i went and they gave to jacob all the water including the one that rachel picked up from lebanon anybody clear all the strange gods were which were in their hand and all their earrings which were in their ears the wrong faith and jacob hid them under the ark which was by sikkim everybody clear so far verse 5 and the journey and the terror of god after that cleanness after that sanctification after that purging and the journey and the terror of god was upon the cities that were around about them and they did not pursue after after the sons of jacob so jacob came to lose which is in the land of canaan that is what he brought him back again to bethel now as the omega he and all the people that were with him everybody cleared so far now job to verse 16 after that purging this coming to bethel he's going to do something verse 16 are you there and the journey from bethel i'm going to explain this clearly he left better he went into a journey then he came back to bethel amen when he came back for into better everything was purged completely he was with that spot without god without blemish everything that needed to come out came out amen when that journey finished are you following me jacob now departed from bethel going toward bethlehem amen now from moving to bethel all the way to bethlehem rachel must depart from the earth okay verse 16 and the journey from bethel and there was by the leader way to come to ephraim that is bethlehem and rachel did what travailed and she had hard labor it's a load of persecution amen it's a lot of persecution it's hard amen before the departure of rachel okay verse 17 and he came to pass when she was in a hard level that the midwife said to her fear not you shall have this son also and he came to pass as his soul was what so jack rachel and benjamin cannot be together on the earth [Music] are you following me are you following me rachel he's a woman she is a church a man and she was giving birth to who who is benjamin you're you're already in university in this church who is who is benjamin everybody's here everybody clear the church cannot be together with the hundred and forty four thousand amen before the hundred and forty four thousand our birth into this earth rachel must depart rachel must go everybody clear hallelujah and it came to pass when she was in a hard labor that the midwife said to her fear not you shall have this son also and it came to pass as her soul was departing they cannot be together on the earth the bride cannot be here on the earth when the gospel is going back to the jews anybody clear for she died that she called his name ben owning but he's fi in other words the son of my sorrow she's going out through persecution amen the beast is bringing pressure by that pressure we give birth to benjamin everybody clear everybody clear remember in revelation 10 when the angel came down he put one foot on the earth and one foot upon the sea but in daniel 12 the angel already removed the food from the earth and he put two feet upon the sea because the beast from america is released the economical council is now free through the tribulation period hallelujah verse 19 and richard died and was buried in the way to ephra which is water so they were going back from bethel to bethlehem from better out back to better then from better to bethlehem the bride must go because the gospel is going back again to the jews everybody clear so far last scripture john chapter 1 hallelujah john chapter 1 verse 51 if you dare you can say amen let's go to verse 50 first then jesus answered and said to him because i said to you i saw you under the fig tree believe you you shall see greater things than these devil is wasting his time verse 51 and he said to him verily verily i say unto you hereafter you shall see what heaven open and water you need to preach with me this morning i know some were battling some were sick but you just need to shake yourself amen i can't get used to a quiet church brother branham say where god is there is noise okay praise thee the name of the lord hereafter you shall see heaven open and what the angels of god not one many the angels of god doing what ascending and water upon who everybody clear so it started with the alpha ministry of jesus christ and it's going to be finished with the omega ministry in the brother and once that ministry purged the bread completely and we move everything to produce a blood without spot or wrinkle then we gonna depart from the earth because benjamin need to be born hallelujah let's pray now heavenly father lord we thank you again for your grace for your love your mercy father and for everything you're doing for us lord we are surrendering our bodies our spirit our soul everything unto the hand lord father may you move me completely out of the way lord may you come and anoint this service and speak to your children father lord be the alpha and the omega again lord we seal the devil completely away from this place lord father your word stated that you send it lord father to heal your children may lord father those that need the holy spirit together may those that need healing be healed may you touch and minister to each one according to their need lord father we ambly asked in the name of jesus christ amen god richly bless you hallelujah everybody rappy blessed be the name of the lord we are in king ahazaris three feast and esther 2 banquet part 11. amen last sunday if you can go with me on genesis chapter 2 let's go to genesis chapter 2 just give me some grace i gotta travel some avenue we found out last week that god when he created man he created man in his own image everybody knows what he means now and in his own likeness and the man that was created there was a spirit man because the bible says in the book of john that god is a spirit and those that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth so when god birthed this man this man came as a male and as a female and this man was in the image of god himself the image of god is not men and men the image of god is not woman and woman the image of god is man and a woman god is not a gay god is not a lesbian a man it is a man and a female together amen that is the original and everything against the original is a perversion amen now in genesis in when he created man in genesis chapter 1 verse 26 this man here was a spirit man amen when we speak about the spirit i explained to you in living word tabernacle that a spirit is not a soul anybody remember there are different kind of a spirit there is animal spirit there is fish spirit there is a bird spirit and we also have human when we're talking about human spirit it is a spirit that everybody in this building here has a human spirit make you to act and to react and to live like a human a bird spirit make you act react and to fly like a bird a fish spirit will make you live the life of a fish amen but the soul is the nature of the spirit everybody clear in other words the difference between me and my brother we are not different by spirit we are different by soul the soul is your personal identification the soul is what we are different from one another but by spirit we all take a shower by spirit we all drink by spirit we all eat by spirit we talk but by soul you might like the color blue and i don't like the color blue you might like the color white and i don't like the color white somebody might like his car to be black somebody might want his car to be pink that is the preference not on the spirit but on the soul of the individual amen so when god created man god created the spirit and god spirit has already souls and there was a soul for adam and there was also a soul for evil the soul of adam was a masculine soul and the soul of eve was a feminine soul everybody clear now in genesis 2 let's go to genesis chapter 2. verse 5 if you dare you can say amen and every plant of the field before it was in the earth and every herb of the field before it grew for the lord god has not caused it to rain upon the earth the rain happened with noah amen so if you wondered there was no rain brother branham said there was no rain there was no rain until noah your scripture is due there amen for the lord because for the lord god had not caused it to reign upon the earth and there was no man to do what the man already existed in the form of a spirit amen but the spirit cannot till the ground the spirit cannot do your physical work amen there was somebody was already there but he lacked the body to put him in contact with the earth everybody cleared so far praise the name of the lord verse 7 and the lord god form what out of the dust of water so in genesis chapter 2 verse 7 god in this particular part now he's forming the body of adam or the physical body of adam adam already existed here as a spirit adam had a nature amen but what god did in genesis 2 he took that spirit that was already living are you following me adam was already alive amen he just took adam and put him into the body you have let me do this so he can we can make sense this is the body of adam we have a spirit god created the body and he took the spirit of adam the male part and put that inside the body of adam everybody clear so adam here was a human being are you following me with a body with a soul and with our spirit amen let's go to genesis chapter 2 verse 7 and god formed men of the dust of the ground and god did what and he who is breathing are you okay god breathed into his nostril the breath of what i thought adam was already alive i'm going slowly because you need to get this adam was already created adam was already alive amen god took the spirit of adam and put that spirit in the body but god breathed the breath of life what kind of life does god and god breathed in his nostril the word the breath of life and man became a walker man already had a soul are you following me but that soul was subject to death are you following me then god breathes the breath of life the life that came from god enter into adam are you there then adam became a living soul a soul that has eternal life when we say spirit here it's life the body without the spirit james says is what in the book of luke chapter 24 verse 36 the bible says and as they does speak jesus himself stood in the midst of them this is after his resurrection and say unto them peace be unto you but they were water and water and suppose that they have seen everybody care they thought that it was a spirit in other words a ghost everybody clear and he said unto them why are you trouble and why do you why do thoughts arise in your heart behold my what and my what daddy daddy it is i myself handle me and see forever this is from your bible i'm giving you the definition or characteristic of the spirit for air spirit has not what and what as you see me and if and because they continue to doubt jesus told them give me a fish and he took the fish and head to show them that this is not a spirit but this is a body amen this is a spirit in a body a spirit in the body can eat everybody clear god cannot eat that's why in genesis 18 god fabricated a body amen and god could eat pork chops he was not a vegetarian amen if you want to eat your salad that's fine no problem don't say my person say don't eat salad everybody clear praise the name of the lord in blasphemy's name brother branham saying but what god did he breathed the water they prayed for florida everybody cleared so far then he become a soul that cannot now watch we are going to get into honey plum to your elbows breathe the breath of water into his water and he became awake because adam already existed they gave him eternal life i don't want you to get confused because at this point we have no dispensation this is not the law this is not grace nothing has happened sin is not introduced to the word yet this is at the beginning before the fall when the fall happened that's when god changed the jurisdiction job to verse nine hallelujah and out of the ground may the lord god to grow everything every tree that is present that is pleasant to the site and good for what the tree of what the tree of life was in the middle everybody clear also in the midst of the garden and the tree of the knowledge of what an evil everybody clear let's jump to verse 16. hallelujah you there and the lord god commanded the man saying of what of the garden you may freely when they say every tree means every tree including the tree of life everybody there watch carefully verse 17 but of what the tree of the knowledge of good and evil you shall not what for in the dead that you eat thereof you shall water so god is telling adam you can eat every tree here including the tree of life but if you notice adam never touch the tree of life are you there because adam already have the breath of life are you following me god already gave him eternal life that's why he never want to touch the tree of life again are you following me hallelujah [Music] praise be the name of the lord because god breathes not what what by what breathe the breath of life into his and he became a what then you said to me adam died brother branham but remember before adam died he had water a lamb that redeemed him hallelujah those who he foreign he has what remember that lamb was land before the foundation of the world he got the lamb to redeem them he was a top adam fell then the lamb was provided for adam because already in his what he had become the breath of and he became a living he was a son of who luke chapter 3 verse 38 if you check the bible say adam the son of who praise the name of the lord let's continue god especially upon adam breathed the breath of eternal life and he became an eternal person with god he had power like what that's the eternal life god gave him that's what gave him power how was adam moving the stuff where did he get that power amen that's why they said jesus is the second and last adam amen he had power like god he was an amateur god he was god of the earth not god of heaven god of the earth someday the sons of god will again become what jesus said so is he not written in your law he or what now we are getting into something deeper now watch this when we drive it down he is now a son of god but he makes a mistake he knows he's doing wrong now remember adam was not deceived everybody clear it's in the scripture adam was not deceived but the woman was deceived was in the transgression adam walked with eve because he was his wife in other words adam will fully sin to save eve same as christ amen jesus never seen jesus became sin for you he accepted to become sin hallelujah same as who not deceived by satan but walk into death with them just like adam did that's why jesus is the second adam amen he wants to be with the brother so he could redeem the word the church of jesus christ is the body of jesus christ first the lord will enter his temple and then on the day of pentecost he entered again the temple ah that was in god he poured that in what and all that was in christ he poured that in what take colossians chapter 1 amen blessed be the name of the lord bear with me we're moving slowly if you dare you can say amen colossians chapter one pages are still flipping colossians chapter 1 verse 18. everybody there and he is what who's the head everybody clear now amen that's why in sunset montana when the cloud came the seven angels formed only the head not the body because the head came to connect with the body are you there when they took the picture they flip it it's only the head of christ not the body because the body is the church the head is coming to connect with the body and to take the rapture anybody following me colossians 18 18 he is the word the head of what come up there so the church is the body of who anybody clear the body the church who is the beginning the firstborn from the dead that in all things he might have thee drop now to verse 24 who now rejoice in my sufferings for you and fill up that which is behind of the affliction of christ in my flesh for he is which is the ever clear so the body of the lord jesus christ is there everybody clear that's why like we heard the lord's supper that's why brother branham said when they say discern the body they are telling you to discern the church question and answer in 1963 many are sick and weakly among you because of discerning the water that is exactly right because the lord's body is there see they don't know how to behave themselves lives any kind of life and take communion and things like the brother was ministering that's not right when people take communion they lie and steal and drink that is terrible you should not do that everybody clear in a message communion brother branham said but taking the body of the lord jesus christ in this communion doesn't mean that communion is the literal body of christ that is catholic i do not believe that is right i believe it's only a nodiness that god made us it is not the actual body it is really a little piece of kosher bread like the broth explaining it is just a nodiness amen so what we are taking in the lord supper it is a representation amen the body of jesus christ is represented it is not the body but it's just a type a representation of the body and the blood of jesus christ every clear amen adam know he was wrong so he just walked out with evil but there was a lamb provided for them that they were redeemed in a message souls that are in prison after he had done mad men in his own image created he damn man and what and he put him in the dust of the earth therefore he become he was the man this human man was memo he's talking about the body the physical body he was animal but he put this water spirit of god a water into water so adam had eternal life everybody clear brother branham says this in the bridge the fulfilling title is now in the hand of the original owner almighty god amen when man sin when adam willfully sinned the tattoo deal of redemption was taken away from adam back to the original honor god himself because the hand of satan could not handle the tattoo deal let's go back to genesis chapter 3 [Music] blessed be the name of the lord genesis chapter 3 verse 22. remember the tree of life was there adam never touched it he was eating everything he already have eternal life god already gave it to him amen but the tree of life the title he was in his hand so he has a right to the tree of life and a right to govern the earth amen but when he sinned and the tattooed he was taken off from him then god blocked the access to the tree of life now after that from that point nobody had access again to the tree of life genesis 3 verse 22 and the lord god saying behold the man is become as one of us to know good and what and now lest he put forth his hand and take also off the tree of what and eat and leave what in other words from there on no more human being will be allowed to approach the tree of life you must wait for the redeemer to come that's why when jesus christ came he said i am the bread that came down from heaven in other words i am the tree of life that is made flesh [Music] amen he forfeited it when adam forfeited it then certain deadly hand could not take it he went back to the original order god himself it's the title due to the earth and to the eternal life they tatted due to eternal life abstract title due to eternal life when adam forfeited for what instead of what that's why brother branham preached wisdom verses i went back to the hand of the honor almighty god what a great thing everybody clear now last sunday as we enter into into esther chapter five let's go to esther chapter five hallelujah are you still okay are you still happy i hope nobody's sleeping except you work at night if you don't work all night get on bed on time so you won't sleep in church [Music] amen we found out that there were three days everybody clear there was 30 days that esther never went to the king amen and then esther took three steps which we explained to you justification baptism of the holy spirit the three steps here that's going to bring you to eternity everybody clear then we enter on the third day which was the pentecostal edge and we found out on the first banquet that the first banquet was the banquet of wine and that banquet was not on the fourth day but on the third day because on the third day there is a coming of the king into the queen which was the outpouring of the holy spirit on azusa street on the pentecostal edge and that outpouring brought the holy spirit bringing or restoring the gift and bringing also divine healing which was the festival and we found out that haman was there and heaven was happy amen because the rain fall upon the justin bieber it was the time of the anointed one at the end time they can leave any kind of way but still they can protect to the banquet amen until maudeka showed up then the countenance of him and changed which was the first phase of the second pool everybody clear then when he was mad he went home and he unfolded three things that's where we stop right now let's go to esther chapter 5 verse 11. [Music] everybody clear i'm going to start from 10. somebody's still flipping pages if you're there you can say amen nevertheless heyman refrained himself and when he came home he sent and called for his friend and zerush his wife so he had a wife he had the church and zeresh means gold and you know who owned the gold of the earth amen that's the harlot amen which is the wife of satan because later on when we go into the rapture the devil will incarnate himself in the pope amen verse 11 and amen taught them of what [Music] everybody following me too quiet and heaven tell them of the glory of his riches okay i'm gonna read with you one time and we're gonna read it again and heaven taught them of the glory of his riches and the multitude of his children and all the things wearing the king had promoted him and how he had advanced him above the princes and the servants of the king hermann said moreover yea esther the queen did let no man come in with me with the king to the banquet that she had prepared but myself and tomorrow on the fourth day i am invited to her also with the king yet all this avail of what so long as i see mordecai the jew sitting adder so regardless of what a man head as long as mordecai is alive he must destroy the mystery of mordechai amen now let's go back and then begin to dig let's go back to verse 11 now and heaven taught them of the glory of his riches comma so the first thing he's telling him here we know heaven is the type of the devil we already demonstrated that there are three things that heaven is unfolding here that he is possessing don't you buckle up good the first one he's telling them about the what the glory of his riches everybody clear let's go to the second thing number two the what the multitude of his that's the second thing the multitude of his children come on everybody seen that number three and what oh they are summarizing everything now and all the things wearing the king head if you notice the one who promoted a man was the king anybody clear his power came from the king everybody clear oh that the king had promoted him and how he had advanced him above the princes and the servant of the so the third thing is eamon is talking about his promotion and his position above everybody all the princes i have the big shot in this kingdom i am above everybody i am above the entire world there is only one person that is above me that is the king number one the glory of his riches number two the multitude of his children number three the promotion or position that is above all things amen what is happening here what is going on brother stephen take first john chapter two or you can stay where you are or take first john chapter two i have it on board i just want you to read it yourself everybody clear amen the bible says love not what everybody following me can you see better i hope that won't make somebody sleep love not the world neither the things that are in there okay if any man loves the world the love of the father is not in everybody clear so far john is talking to us about the world he said do not love the world and don't even love the things that are in the world so what is the world is it this planet here or it's what for all that is in the world in other words everything that is in the world everybody following me everything that is in the world is con is bundled up in three points are you following me oh that is in the world everything in the world is on three part only are you following me number one the last of the flesh hallelujah we are talking about the world john is telling us that let me put a planet here there are stuff inside this world amen john is saying that everything that is within this world amen is categorized or is under three category let me say it that way the first category is what the last of the flesh that's number one number two the last of the eyes everybody care number three the pride of life so everything that is in the world either it's gonna be under the pride of life or it's gonna be under the last of the eyes or it's gonna be under the last of the flesh everything that is in the world are either between those three everybody clear all that is in the world the last of the flesh number one the last of the eyes number two and the pride of life is not of the father are you following me it doesn't belong to god but it is of the world and the world do not pericomia and uh last thereof but he that do the will of god and by death the will of god we saw it it's the word of god everybody following me brother branham in matthew chapter 4 when jesus is tempted of the devil he overcame the personal temptation of who by the word and by the word only anybody clear in each of the three major what so now brother branham is explaining us that these three categories are the major trials of the devil we need to be taught this thing amen in each of the three major trials that correspond exactly to the temptation of the garden of eden brother branham is going to tell us what are the major trials the last of the flesh everybody see that the lust of the eyes everybody see that and the proud of life jesus overcome by though he fell to the personal temptation of satan by failing to use the let's take matthew chapter four and let's see what's going on hallelujah matthew chapter 4 brother branham say matthew let's go to matthew amen praise the name of the lord if you dare you can say amen verse one then was jesus led up of the spirit in the wilderness to be tempted of the devil we already spoke about this now follow me very carefully the first is the lust of water anybody knows what flesh means it is body amen this body remember paul last week told us that in this body there is sin when i want to do good here somebody's here and the devil uses that everybody clear that's why paul said i must bring this body under subjection everybody clear verse two and when he had fasted forty days and forty night he was afterward what let me ask you a question is a hunger a proud of life can you stay awake it's hunger the lust of the eyes hunger affect what everybody everybody clear brother brother said it he just left it alone everybody clear verse 3 the last of the flesh you just saw amen once that happened verse 3 and when the tempter came to him he said if you be the son of god the god command that this stone be made into what he was tempting him by the last of the flesh that's why brother branham said jesus weakness was what anger it's the last of the flesh everybody now amen but he answered by the word it is written men shall not live by what bread alone but by every word that proceeded out of the mouth of who so jesus is answering that i am not only have to take care of this body but i have the inside men that feed on the world everybody here white dog and black dog amen verse 5 then the devil take him up into a a holy city we are now in religion everybody following me and set him on the pinnacle of what the nightclub of the temple amen religious and said to him if jesus the devil took him and went with him into the temple was people in the temple yes he took him way up in the temple and put him up there and he's telling him to do something he said cast yourself down for it is written you shall he shall give his angel charge concerning you and in the hand they shall bury you up lester any time you dash your foot against the stone we might need to understand this better brother branham help us i want you to get that very good his 40 days of temptation by god's word he overcame satan made what through a major assault he was trial now it's assault three of them upon him in that temptation it's always in them your three categories here everybody here that belong to the devil that's where he operates everybody there don't forget it he made three major assault from the highest to the lowest he tried his best to conquer him what did he use himself the word sentence three major attacks or assault upon him but he met it with the word that's your keys flesh the first he made his attack upon to use his great power and satan came and wanted him to use his own power on himself to feed him he wanted to feed himself he was what a man gets what he can do almost he shall still rob beg borrow anything he had that that's your first one here the last of the flesh everybody clear now we see him in the temple we're trying to understand the temple then the second assault ashahari just look like the time just goes fast the next greatest thought was that he made him that he would be a what everybody following me so when he was telling him to cast himself down people were under and the devil was telling him go ahead and show off cash yourself down so the people will see you when they will see angel coming and carrying you up they're going to believe you and how that he hit god's servants to be here to show what you can do glory to god hallelujah i am a deliverer i am so-and-so i prayed for so and so he was healed i prayed for so and so he was healed you wonder the devil are you there come up here on top of the temple and set down here he tempted him to do it now remember he was tempted to do it hard say now if you want to be something before the people stand up here on this temple jump off i shall give you a scripture for it because it's written he shall give the angel charge over thee lest at any time dash a foot against the stone he bear you up to make him water and show his what everybody care that's why brother branham said you must check your motives and your objective even though it's written in the bible what is pushing you are you there what is motivating you to do what you're doing if you don't pay attention you wonder the pride of life everybody clear drop down to verse 8 the first hunger the second at the temple religiously the pride of life verse 3 and verse 8 and the devil take him up into an exceeding water high mountain indeed what do you see me indeed what do you see me do you see my finger anybody care the devil take him up exceedingly in the high mountain and shows your eyes the lust of the eyes show him all the kingdom of the and the glory of them remember heaven was bursting about their glory are we okay are we okay now okay and say to him all these things will i give you if you fall down and worship me every clear so we understand now that when he showed him the glory of the kingdom everybody there he was with the last of the eyes the pride of life he took him into a temple in the holy city everybody clear praise the name of the lord hallelujah now we found out that herman spoke about three things we have the glory of his riches we have the multitude of his children and we have the promotion or his position that is above everybody everybody following me we know that children comes by the wheel of the flesh everybody following me brother branham the head body on the sixth dimension there could not be sinning the man could not be seen the men and women those women were hugging me brother branham went to the sixth dimension the women were hugging him and for some reason he didn't feel anything amen but there was no possibility of ever seen there again because the glance of her body everybody calling me last of the flesh last of the flesh the glance of our body will be changed there amen we are different sex now because that is the reproducing of where they're reproducing the world for the reproducing the world and our marriage to bring children but then there shall be no more need of that there shall be no more children born we won't have sex glad in the new not at all but there will be no more male and female among them in that way and damn gland won't be in so there shall be no way at all for satan to ever work another trick on because the sex glands are no longer there then the lust of the flesh is automatically blocked everybody there that is the redemption of the body when we receive glorified body he automatically block the devil everybody clear brother branham said he showed here in the beginning that his perfect will was to create man out of the dust of them we talked about it already he permitted what to be brought in he never did intend children to be born by what but he was what which will soon fade away amen so when heaven was talking about the multitude of his children amen was showing one of his kingdom category which is the last of them everybody cleared so far amen the last of the earth which is the glory of his kingdom remember jesus they show him the glory of the kingdom the last of the eyes and the third one he was a promotion he's above everybody the king promoted him the king put him above everybody that is the proud of what all that is in the world the lust of the flesh the last of the eyes and the pride of life that's why herman is demonstrating you his kingdom that he is about the last of the eyes he's about the last of the flesh and he's about the pride of what life and his promotion came from who from the kingdom psalm 75 the bible says that promotion cometh leader from what and from what and from what did you see it from the north are we okay why not from the north because he comes from the north what is in the north psalm 48 beautiful for situation the joy of the whole world is mount what jerusalem on the side of the [Music] the city of the great that's why david said not enough because the promotion comes from god and god is in the north isaiah 14 how are they falling from heaven or lucifer son of the morning how are they cut down to the ground which did weaken the nation for that has said in their heart like heaven i will ascend into heaven i will exalt my throne above the stars of god the children of god i will sit also upon the word of the congregation in what why was lucifer looking for the north amen that's where the king is i will ascend above the height of the cloud i will be like the most high everybody clear amen now when we spoke about the world now the world the true meaning of the word is not the planet are we okay the planet is earth but the word means cosmos [Music] take genesis chapter 1 blessed be the name of the lord speed is slow anyway we can rush genesis chapter 1 verse 1. everybody there in the beginning god created the what and what in the beginning god created the heaven the galaxy everybody here among those galaxies there are many planets amen then they say earth god created the heaven the solar system the galaxies but moses want to speak about the earth he created the heaven and the earth everybody following me amen and he that's the reason why he mentioned earth because jupiter is a planet venus is a planet there are tons of planets but those planets are not connected to redemption and moses is telling about the story of redemption everybody following me so he's starting first he said there is many people in spoken word tabernacle and there was brother kelly amen in other words i'm bringing you to brother kelly i want to talk about brother kelly but there is many people and brother kelly the lord created the heaven and the earth now he goes back to the earth specifically now the earth in other words moses now leaves the universe he picked the earth now he enter inside the earth it's a prophet amen and the earth was without form and what void and was upon the face of the and the spirit of god move upon the face of death in other words god created god was here created everything then moses says god move from outside and enter into the earth are you following me when he entered into the earth whatever there was inside the earth was if without form and was darkness anybody following me tech job 37 amen blessed be the name of the lord job thirty seven if you dare you can say amen job 37 verse 12. everybody there and i'm just trying to explain to you the difference between earth and the world everybody clear and it is turnaround it is turned round about by his council that they may do whatsoever he commands them upon the face of the indy everybody see that do you see that the world this is the earth this is the planet job is telling us that inside the planet there is the world amen in the planet earth you see now so world and earth are two different things go to psalm 90 i'm going to travel a few then we go amen psalm chapter 90. if you dare you can say amen verse 2 before the mountain were brought forth all ever you have formed there and there do you see both of them everybody see that one more jeremiah 25 then i get you where i'm going amen we're looking at the power of heaven and how to break it jeremiah 25 26 if you dare you can say amen and all the kings of the north far and near one with another and all the what after which are upon the world so you see what the world means now amen the world is not the planet the planet is earth the world is whatever is inside the planet that is what is called the world that's why when they say heaven and earth will pass away you gotta know what they're talking about amen brother branham what is the world he uses the word world as the greek word cosmos which means what the world order in other words the atmosphere within the earth within the planet earth everybody clear the earth shall pass away melt the element with fervent heat does not mean that the earth the planet is going to pass away not the planet amen but the world cosmos the what inside the world inside the earth the sinner the system sin disease germs everything that is what all that is in the world is combined in the lust of the flesh it's combined in the last of the eyes and it's combined in the pride of life everybody follow me satan's army bring diseases that is what satan is he is a destroyer the whole kingdom of satan is what and what and what and what and what and what all of satan amen god's eden was established in righteousness satan's idiom is establishing sin because satan is what god is righteousness and god's kingdom was established in righteousness and peace and life and satan's establishment is in sin and religious sin everybody clear in first john chapter 5 verse 19 the bible says that we know that we are of god and the whole world lie in what the cosmos the atmosphere within the earth is completely of the devil [Music] if the world not the earth now hates you if heaven hates you if an amalekite hates you are you following me you know that he hated me before he hated you if you were often the world would have the reason why you are not loved because you don't belong to the kingdom of satan because you are not of the world but i have chosen you out of the world therefore the world hated you everybody clear amen and she spare not this is peter the old world but save noah the eighth person a preacher of righteousness bringing the flood upon the earth of the earth the planet was not destroyed but it was the people and the lifestyle that was on the planet that was destroyed that is called the world amen that's why the bible say whereby the world that was then not the planet being overflown by what perish the world perish but the planet was still there everybody clear amen hallelujah brother pronoun in the mark of the beast he said don't act like the hidden the unbeliever don't yoke yourself with them come out from among them don't be this way if you love them and the things of the the word so we found out that fashion is of the world that word comes from the greek cosmos which means the fashion of god hallelujah and they that use this word as not abusing it for the fashion of this word will do what because it's part of the are you following me that's why paul said that be not conformed to this what because this world is under this category that's the power of heaven amen be not confirmed to this world but be transformed by what the renewing of your mind that he may prove what is what acceptable and perfect will of what the friendship of the world is what because you are under heaven everybody enmity with god whatsoever therefore will be a friend of them not the planet is the enemy of who because of these three categories everybody clear there is so many people that doesn't seems to have any kind of a purpose in life especially in this day that we now live people just seems to think that all they have to do is to keep up with somebody else amen when beyonce does something on tv every single woman including in the message they want to copy beyonce beyonce is under the devil amen when a star does something on tv he is under the devil amen you see people cutting their hair a certain way especially young people before you know it all the young people in the message want to cut their hair a certain way do you know where he come from do you know where he came from it is coming from the kingdom of satan and you are being confirmed with the world they put red hair everybody want to put the head here amen if you want to grow your beard do it but don't do it because a star did let me repeat it again let me repeat it again if you want to grow your being go ahead and do it there's nothing wrong with it but don't do it because every single young man nowadays is growing bill you are under the influence of satan are you there if you want to fix your hair fix it but don't fix your hair according to the trend of the world nowadays they go natural are you going natural because you want to go natural or you are going natural because every woman in america is going natural [Applause] are you following me if you want to do it on yourself no problem but watch the spirit watch the motive watch the source of inspiration where are you getting that why are you doing this no no no i'm just cutting it there why you didn't cut your hair like that all this time amen why you only start doing that because everybody in college is doing it amen you under satan you wonder heaven amen they want to keep up with somebody else with the fashion of the world and with the enticement that the world has given them the bible says that we can overcome the world and how can we do it not by keeping up with the fashion of that stop that amen it is a shame if a football player begin to do this you see sisters brothers in the message they meet one another they meet one another you wonder where did you get that because the alarm is doing that amen somebody turn around and where did you get that because somebody was doing that where did you copy that let's be honest we're going to heaven where do you copy that where do you copy your selfie why you didn't do selfie all this time while you waited when everybody else have to do this that's when you also have to do this all that is in the world even your selfie it is in the pride of life amen all your whatsapp posting the pride of life amen oh your facebook posting the proud of life amen you want to prove to somebody what you gave you want to show off your house you want to show off your car you want to show off your clothing because some people didn't come to church they didn't see you you make sure you post them so they can see you up there all that is in the world the last of the flesh the last of the eyes and the pride of life is of the devil dress nice for yourself fix your hair for yourself have a nice car for yourself have a nice house for yourself but always watch the motive watch the objective watch the source [Applause] if not you can think you in the will of god and then you are under the devil amen the devil taught jesus christ it is written but it was a scripture from the devil yet he was in the scripture amen amen why are you doing what you're doing amen but the bible says that faith is the victory that overcometh the world everybody clear so we found out that these three categories the last of the flesh the last of the eyes the pride of life is the concession of amen that is what heaven is bragging over amen when jesus was taken over there they show him the kingdom of the world amen and they show him the politics of the world amen that was the first one the last of the eyes they show him the politic of the world the kingdom amen the second one the bible says in collection that now the work of the flesh are manifested which are this what it's a spirit fornication a spirit uncleanness a spirit lasciviousness a demon idolatry a demon witchcraft a demon hatred a demon variance a demon emulation a demon raphael demon suffered demon sedition a demon envy demon murder demon drunkenness demon dead that do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of what because you are under the kingdom of the devil what i'm trying to draw there is the lust of the flesh is demonic amen amen the last of the eyes they show jesus the kingdom the politics brother branham say every kingdom was shown to jesus christ including america amen that's the political the multitude of the children lust of the flesh demonic because the work of the flesh we saw them amen but you remember he went to the temple to give him the pride amen that is a religious place amen if you watch those three you're gonna see your three seals amen the antichrist starts with a white horse rather the anticlass is a spirit that was demonic power then he changed to the political power then he began to kill people then he changed to the religious power he began to sell the bread of life the last of the eyes the lust of the flesh and the proud of life the first seal the second seal and the third seal when you put those three sales together you got the fourth seal which is death everybody clear can i add something they're proud of life popularity you ready can i add something else the lust of the flesh women amen can i add something else money the riches amen heaven brag about the glory of his riches demanded of his children and the promotion and his position he was bragging about the last of the eyes the last of the flesh and the proud of the life he was bragging about the first seal the second seal and the third sale because all three seals make the fourth one which is death that's why brother branham saved money money the glory of his witches the last of the eyes we men the last of the flesh and the pride of love popularity were many women popularity your three seals all locked up together under heaven the kingdom of the devil money women popularity first year second seal third sale the last of the eyes the last of the flesh and the pride of life all three combined together everybody clear satan will make you all kind of promises but he has nothing to give you because he don't have nothing he don't have no salvation what is satan anything that is contrary to them his kingdom is what the end thereof is what the pearl horse rather the three horses put together darkness and death is water brother branham repeat it again what is satan kingdom anything contrary to what it is counting my friend but it's time for cutting the branch the tree it's going to bear must be pruned anything contrary to the precept of god the word of god is not of god what is the kingdom of satan anything that is setting something to take the place of what that's an adult [Music] amen that's what rachel packed amen anything any what teaching our teaching must be lined up with the reveal word of the hour amen these things i have spoken to you that in me you might have peace in the world you shall have what but be of good cheer because i have overcome what i have overcome amen i have the solution amen amen don't be afraid all the lust of the flesh the last of the eyes and the proud of life be of good cheers i have overcome the world i have often come satan hallelujah let me check my time hallelujah they that are in what have crucified water have crucified water and what his affection and what for if after they have escaped the pollution of the pollution by the lust of the flesh the last of the eyes and the pride of life how do you escape the pollution of the world through the water of what through the message of your day amen there again entangled therein so once you get in the message and you leave the message amen you are again entangled and overcame the latter end is worse with them then their beginning you get into a worse situation than before because by coming into the light the light will chase away darkness amen and god promised the evening light hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord the seven angels message under the same trumpet same everything exactly the same seal which is the seventh call the people the bride out of the water and the what the message is to deliver you from this amen amen and to bring you to a genuine atonement the word christ impersonated in his word made flesh among us why because he overcome the world that's why he said be of good cheers shunning that same gospel of light that shine in the east is shining in the west it shall be light in the evening time rise and do what trim your lamp trim off water the last of the flesh the last of the eyes and the pride of life trim off the world trim off what dream of what when he start descending from heaven there is uh what is the shout er to get the people together amen now lamp what that's the message gonna help you stream of the world that's why the message say take off the lipstick away take off the high heel away take off the tight dresses away by dressing yourself tight you are enthusing the flesh of someone the lust of the flesh amen dream of the world amen behold the bird gum cometh rise and trim your lamp but it's lamp trimming time it is what that's why a message have to come to trim the god of rachel to trim all the god that they pack to remove the god from jacob before the departure of rachel amen but all this the devil is not pleased with it it means nothing because mordecai because the message of the hour is the only thing that's gonna take the grip of satan out of your life that's why satan is against the message amen hallelujah look at jesus to identify himself as what you remember this yes you remember this you remember that as this stone that would never let the promise slip this stone that would anchor forever and forever god coveted and promised people he said does that believe because i told you these things that shall see greater things than that you shall see the heaven open and the angel of god do what and what upon the son of god up and down what the ministry of the son of man was jacob's lady amen because he is god's ankle the angel ascending and descending going up first and then coming down see they are taking the message going up and bringing it back ascending and descending upon death and in the end time we didn't see one angel not too bad seven engines ascending again and descending upon this son of man the constellation of seven angels descending upon the son of man back to better amen he was that anchoring place where jacob's ladder where the promised seed will be he was god's eternal promises he was that sure stone that perfect foundation that god's truth would anchor him and all devils in hell and everything else could never move it amen praise the name of the lord and eliezer found the woman and he know that was her and noticed he had to deal with how many people when nes went to pick up rebecca there were two people that we stood him amen two people her mother and her do you know the brother of rebecca what was his name lebanon and when rachel was going she stole the idol of whom amen praise the name of the lord so has the messenger the holy ghost of god in this last day picking out the brother he had to deal with the church that called herself mother the catholic and the preacher denominational preacher amen that's your laban amen that is exactly he had to deal with those two there was the one that kicked up and fast against it that's why they get the message amen blessed be the moment the lord there is many gods in the earth today some of them is the god's pleasure jacob rachel picked it up somehow the god of flesh they make most of the worldly pleasure a god they can only be worshiped by those who walk in what of the true and what but we are not ignorant we have the evening light amen the bible says she returned back to her god speaking about oprah many times we return back to the gods of our beginning eyes of what after the wrong thing pornography we shall turn back and lasting again maybe we got others of drinking adults of water adders of water addons of water all kind of water and then profess to be and then turn to detail that's why a message have to come to clean up this thing that's why airmen is against the message he's against mordecai because monica is the one that have the key to unlock the mystery and to tell you that the letter everybody's reading is not truly what is going on there is a background story behind it i know the story i have the seal of god i can unfold to you the seal and the devil doesn't want to be exposed because once he's exposed he become powerless everybody clear amen amen blessed be the name of the lord let's go to esther 5 and then we finish amen i have one minute hallelujah to finish let's go to esther chapter five blessed be the name of the lord amen we were on verse 5 at verse chapter 5 verse 11. you understand the lust of the flesh the last of the eyes and the pride of life verse 12 and a man said queen esther did let no man come with me with uh with the king to the banquet that she had prepared by myself and tomorrow i am invited to her also tomorrow is the fourth day remember the first the second the third she already consumed completely the letter uh the number three now tomorrow is the fourth day it's gonna bring her to zero we're going back to eternity everybody clear so far verse 13 yet all this event of me nothing so long as i see who modika the jew sitting at the kings there is a messenger that is there that is always troubling amen verse 14 then said zaresh his wife and all his friend to him let a what a gallo which is a tree which is a cross amen let a gallow be made of how many cubits the gallow have to be made of 50 cubit and a gallon is a tree remember haman was hanged which was the top of the cross he says that and his wife and his friends say you need to put up a cross and that cross must have how many cubits if you go in the message 50 means pentecostal amen there will be a second crucifixion of the message amen remember the mystery of the first step of the two steps amen the first one was crucified he was broken and rejected amen and the second one have to be rejected again amen that's what they told him they say put up a cross put up a cross a 50 50 cubit it's going to be in the pentecostal age there will be a second crucifixion it was a cross made to crucify mordecai a second crucifixion to reject the message to reject the modica to crucify the message and christ will be on the outside knocking outside trying to get in put up a cross of 50 in the age of pentecost and then crucify mordechai hallelujah let's go to verse 14. then said zerus his wife and all his servant to him let a gallow be made of 50 cubit high the second crucifixion and tomorrow amen on the fourth day speak you to the king to mordecai may he be hanged thereon then you go in merrily with the king to the banquet and the thing pleased him and he caused the gallow to be made the gallow was made to crucify modica on the third day not on the fourth day on on chapter six and then i'm going to close here because we're going to pick up the second banquet amen on that night could not the king's sleep and he commanded to bring the book of record of the chronicle and the red before the king we know this let me drop down and the king say verse 4 and the king say who is in the court if you notice we are on the fourth day it is in the morning now amen hallelujah hallelujah we are on the fourth day the king could not sleep they read for him we are on the fourth day he said who is in the court now heaven was come into the outward court of the king house to speak to the king to do what to hang mordeca this is the fourth day in the morning of the fourth day amen on the gallow that he had prepared for him and what turned out the king said who is the man tell me how we can honor somebody heaven thought he was himself he never understood that it was the ministry of the son of man publicly amen that was on chapter 6 chapter 5 is grace chapter 6 is the number of men which is the ministry of the son of man revealing christ the king stays inside the palace but mordecai went outside with the king horse with the king apparel with the king anointing and revealing to the public completely the son of man on the outside that was the second phase of the tough the second pull the second the first phase it is the discernment of the spirit but the second phase it is to give the messiah son amen when brother branham was turning the back and giving them a side sign and say branham tabernacle received your son that was the second stage of the second pool and he was on the fourth day not on the third day but we enter the fourth day everybody following me then when hammond went home he talked to his wife and his wife said if mordecai is of the race of the jews you're going to completely die amen you won't prevail against him amen hallelujah so what i want you to show you what i want to show you in chapter 6 is in the morning mordecai uh heaven went into the king to get permission he turned wrong unto him he was actually the one who was playing making promotion of modica that's why in the ministry of jesus christ if you notice the pharisee rejected him but when jesus was approaching demon he was the demon they were confessing you are the son of god why did you come to they were the one making advertisement of that ministry amen praise the name of the lord and throughout the entire day it was the ministry of the revealing of the son of man but on the evening time on the evening of the fourth day they came to pick up ammon amen to take him to the banquet he was on the evening of the fourth day to the second banquet which is in esther chapter seven chapter five grace chapter 6 man revelation of the son of man chapter 7 it is fulfillment on the second banquet on the evening of the fourth day let's stand [Applause] amen usually we preach like this and we give you a week before we pick up so you can go
