[22:03] how we love you lord
[22:06] oh father we're so grateful for this
[22:08] relationship that you've unveiled to us
[22:11] lord
[22:12] that personal relationship of yourself
[22:15] to ours
[22:16] is that new birth experience lord jesus
[22:19] and now lord that we've had that birth
[22:21] of that seed that germination of that
[22:23] seed father pour the water of your word
[22:25] in and help us to grow lord god not just
[22:29] into a partial image but into the
[22:31] fullness of the godhead lord jesus for
[22:34] that's what you're yearning for lord
[22:36] you're yearning for your children to
[22:38] come to a place where they perfectly
[22:41] love
[22:42] perfect love
[22:43] help us father
[22:45] help us help me lord
[22:47] help me lord lord jesus and you told us
[22:51] lord god that if we abide in you
[22:53] and you abide in us that we could ask
[22:55] what we will
[22:57] lord we could ask for this brother
[22:59] lamont whose natural brother lord is
[23:02] suffering with blood pressure lord and
[23:04] for his aunt will he may lord jesus we
[23:07] just pray lord god that you'll minister
[23:09] to her healing father god
[23:12] help her lord jesus and for brother
[23:14] jason's church
[23:16] it seems like satan is just targeting
[23:18] the message churches especially with his
[23:21] coven but those demons don't attack
[23:23] those that are of his own flock he
[23:25] attacks those who are outside of his
[23:27] flock father but greater is he that is
[23:30] in us
[23:31] than he that's in the world
[23:32] oh the lord you didn't give us a power
[23:35] of fear but you gave us a spirit of love
[23:38] and of power and of a sound mind and
[23:42] you've taught us to say no to the devil
[23:45] you've taught us to say no to fear
[23:47] you've taught us to say no to
[23:49] frustration you told us to lift up our
[23:51] feeble hands that hang down and consider
[23:55] the ways of the lord jesus who lord went
[23:58] before lord jesus for the joy that was
[24:00] set before him he endured the cross
[24:03] father and lord for the joy that set
[24:06] before us by election and you revealed
[24:09] that election to us at origen now lord
[24:12] god we know what our origin is so we
[24:14] know what our destiny is and lord god
[24:16] we're just looking lord as we grow every
[24:19] day into that full stature of a perfect
[24:22] man father
[24:23] nurtured by your word we love you so
[24:25] much lord god and lord jesus we just
[24:28] pray lord that our worship will be
[24:30] worthy of you lord
[24:31] we pray lord god as children will really
[24:34] be thankful father for the food that
[24:36] you're going to give us today father
[24:38] and lord god will pray that the tithes
[24:40] and the offerings will be given with
[24:41] cheerfulness for the lord loves a
[24:44] cheerful giver and those that don't have
[24:46] lord we know father that you can bless
[24:48] them so they'll have to give abundantly

[30:37] god bless you all
[30:39] amen good morning thank you for all your

[30:42] share
[30:44] yesterday we really had a wonderful
[30:47] as brother sam was saying it's like
[30:49] being on the river to emmaus the lord
[30:51] just
[30:52] was revealing himself to us so
[30:53] wonderfully it just was his grace
[30:56] really enjoyed that trip
[30:58] but um what i wanted to share this
[31:00] morning
[31:01] um
[31:02] most of us will remember last year we
[31:04] had a uh
[31:06] a special gift
[31:07] given to the pastor
[31:10] as it as it was brought to our attention
[31:12] that there was
[31:14] clergy
[31:15] appreciation month was october
[31:19] and um
[31:21] the day
[31:22] october 10 was actually past
[31:24] appreciation day
[31:26] credits to sister priscilla she
[31:28] kept us on line with that
[31:31] um so
[31:34] last year we we all you know came
[31:36] together and gave him a surprise gift
[31:38] but what's been impressing my heart
[31:41] is for
[31:42] if each family here
[31:45] to show our appreciation
[31:48] to the pastor
[31:50] for his dedication for him yielding
[31:52] himself to the gift that is placed in
[31:55] him and how we all benefit
[31:57] rather than just having a group thing if
[32:00] each family
[32:02] could do that
[32:03] and give him something personally
[32:06] just through this month
[32:08] is that something you think we could do
[32:11] okay amen
[32:13] um
[32:14] [Applause]
[32:17] and uh i believe i could speak for the
[32:20] pastor
[32:21] with this verse of scripture
[32:23] the best thing he would like to see
[32:26] as the apostle john
[32:28] in
[32:29] john 3 and verse 4
[32:32] i have no greater joy
[32:35] than to hear that my children walk in
[32:38] truth
[32:39] so for all the labor he has been giving
[32:42] let us show our appreciation to the
[32:44] pastor this month god bless you
[32:52] sister zaddy
[32:55] amen amen
[33:20] god bless you church
[33:24] um this song has been on my heart for a
[33:26] few months um
[33:29] and
[33:30] i just wanted to share this with you as
[33:32] a
[33:34] testimony of how great god is and the
[33:37] feelings that i have towards him for all
[33:39] that he's done in my life
[33:41] i also want to just say that
[33:44] lately you know coming into service a
[33:46] few times has just been really hard to
[33:48] break through
[33:49] and i was told by a close sister and
[33:51] brother that you know
[33:53] another way to look at it is the devil's
[33:55] just trying to block you from being a
[33:58] blessing to other people and so you'll
[34:00] take anything and everything to bring
[34:02] towards you
[34:03] to cause you to not do what the lord has
[34:07] called did you do
[34:09] one of the things that we all know is
[34:11] the gift of
[34:12] singing from me and i don't boast in any
[34:15] way i don't think i'm anything great at
[34:17] all i am grateful for my gift and i do
[34:19] want to use it for his glory but a lot
[34:21] of times the feelings and the
[34:23] emotions of life and the struggles of
[34:26] family and friends and everything else
[34:28] um just tries to to
[34:31] hide that um and so today this song is
[34:34] in defiance to the devil that he will
[34:36] not keep my voice and he will not keep
[34:38] my
[34:39] my my spirit from praising the lord um
[34:42] and so that's what this morning i pray
[34:44] that that's what it is and the lord sees
[34:46] my heart and also
[34:48] um that this is a song that you used to
[34:50] sing at living word and every time
[34:52] he was singing he couldn't get to the
[34:53] song he would just break down crying and
[34:55] it came in my heart one day when i was
[34:57] at work and now at work i'll just sing
[34:59] i'll sing in the hallways i don't care
[35:01] who's watching but then why can't i do
[35:02] that when i come into the house of the
[35:04] lord and so no matter what i may feel
[35:07] the feeling of unworthiness that the
[35:09] devil has tried to put upon me or the
[35:12] way that people maybe think about me or
[35:14] the judgments or the when family maybe
[35:17] see you one way and you don't know like
[35:19] how to express yourself and show like no
[35:21] there has been a change you know i just
[35:24] put all of that behind me today and i
[35:25] just move forward in christ because i
[35:27] know he's been too good for me to stand
[35:29] here and not praise him i feel so bad
[35:32] inside when i have to close my mouth and
[35:34] i'm not opening my mouth and so this
[35:36] morning i will open my mouth and
[35:38] defiance to the devil so i pray this
[35:39] song will be a blessing to each and
[35:41] every one of you that are struggling in
[35:42] whatever way you are i'm just listening
[35:44] to the words
[35:53] i come just now to say thank you o king
[35:58] [Music]
[36:02] you're not just a part of my life but my
[36:05] everything
[36:06] [Music]
[36:08] your love it reaches way down deep
[36:12] within
[36:13] passive human understanding
[36:17] there will always be a song for you i'll
[36:21] sing
[36:24] no word alone cannot express my heart's
[36:29] desire
[36:32] gratitude for one more day my needs

[36:40] your warm embrace and tenderness
[36:45] you're patient with me through all my

[37:26] see

[37:37] gratitude

[37:46] your warm embrace and tenderness
[37:50] you're patient with me throughout my
[37:53] mess

[42:11] as the

[42:14] um i don't think i've ever discouraged
[42:18] anyone
[42:19] from the gift that is placed in them
[42:24] as a singer
[42:25] singers are important
[42:28] they set the battle in a ray
[42:32] to go yes they go first
[42:35] there are others
[42:37] besides sister zaddy here
[42:39] who struggle
[42:41] with allowing that gift
[42:43] to come out and to be used by god
[42:46] and i could call you out individually
[42:48] but i won't
[42:49] okay there's some that aren't even here
[42:51] that are the same way
[42:54] i'm not gonna take any time but i'm
[42:56] gonna say this
[42:57] let
[42:58] god have his way
[43:03] there's no judgment

[43:11] if you have a gift your gift i mean
[43:13] brother we know brother stephen has a
[43:15] gift and we acknowledge that and we
[43:17] appreciate it but without that battle
[43:19] being set in an array properly he won't
[43:22] get past this first row of seats
[43:24] sometimes i can't do it as a song leader
[43:27] it takes a special or two or a group to
[43:30] come up and break through
[43:32] and i'm not a i'm not you know
[43:34] i'm not proud to say i'll do it all no
[43:38] i have encouraged sister zaddy since i
[43:41] don't even know since the first time i

[48:42] i believe the church
[48:44] was well prepared before the departure
[48:47] of our sister to be with the lord
[48:51] the lord
[48:52] led us to speak about the death about
[48:54] the resurrection about the first death
[48:57] about the power of the resurrection
[49:00] where we came from where we're going
[49:03] until there is no more mysteries
[49:06] in this church
[49:07] if somebody live here and go home we
[49:10] know exactly where they're going amen
[49:13] especially a believer that'll be all for
[49:17] the music thank you very much
[49:19] i'm going to read something brother
[49:20] branham spoke
[49:22] concerning our sister
[49:25] brother brother i mean the message the
[49:27] influence of another
[49:28] he said
[49:30] and leo is perhaps here tonight
[49:33] the same boy
[49:35] and i had his mother's funeral
[49:38] the other day
[49:39] and he asked me say billy
[49:42] i wish you would speak on something
[49:44] that proves that my mother ras again
[49:49] i believe that was preached over and
[49:51] over and over in this church we know
[49:54] exactly that sister gene
[49:57] one of this day if you're not going i'm
[50:00] going to meet her
[50:01] before even we meet into the air she'll
[50:03] be rising up here
[50:05] and i won't be surprised if my ring door
[50:09] rang at home
[50:10] and then i come and i say what's going
[50:12] on say pastor i'm back
[50:15] [Laughter]
[50:19] amen
[50:20] if you don't believe it that's your
[50:22] problem i know exactly where sister
[50:24] genie is
[50:25] amen
[50:26] if there was a true believer she was one
[50:29] of them and i am proud to be her pastor
[50:33] amen
[50:34] brother branham continued he said the
[50:36] lord gave me a message for it
[50:41] wait till we get to the resurrection not
[50:43] this morning
[50:45] on exact positive
[50:47] when the bible
[50:48] all nature
[50:50] everything that god created
[50:52] speaks that she shall
[50:55] rise again
[50:56] who is going to speak against them
[51:00] when the lion roars you know what
[51:02] happened
[51:04] god says so
[51:05] proves it by his nature prove it by
[51:09] water
[51:10] i know brother kalima is here so he's
[51:12] not here so you got to preach with me
[51:14] [Laughter]
[51:16] proves it by his word
[51:19] prove it by her
[51:22] who has a problem with sister jin's life
[51:24] again
[51:27] god prove it to you by her life
[51:30] prove it by her life
[51:32] everything else she's got to raise there
[51:36] is no way
[51:38] nothing
[51:39] heaven enough might fail but that won't
[51:41] fail she's got to come forth again
[51:47] [Applause]
[51:50] amen
[51:52] you know when somebody suffers a lot
[51:55] especially goes through sickness
[51:57] and then depart
[51:59] to go
[52:01] to be with the lord
[52:02] usually we have a tendency to say
[52:05] she's in a better place
[52:08] right
[52:09] now she's resting now she's in a more
[52:11] beautiful place
[52:13] but usually when we say that
[52:15] we are saying that in reference to the
[52:18] sickness
[52:22] can i repeat it again
[52:24] do you want me to repeat again
[52:26] in other words if somebody suffered
[52:28] three months two years three years four
[52:30] years if that person passed away
[52:33] we usually comfort ourselves in a human
[52:36] way
[52:38] like oh don't worry she's in a better
[52:41] place
[52:42] and we usually speak that better place
[52:44] in reference
[52:47] to the sickness or the situation that
[52:50] person was before they depart
[52:53] in other words if that person was sick
[52:55] we humanly
[52:58] comfort ourselves saying she's in a
[53:00] better place in other words and most of
[53:03] the time we follow with this word she's
[53:06] no longer sick
[53:08] that's what we usually say she's no
[53:10] longer sick she's in a better place
[53:13] but that's not really where we should
[53:15] stop
[53:18] amen
[53:19] when we say
[53:21] that somebody left and he's in the
[53:23] presence of the lord
[53:25] it is not only a better place in
[53:28] reference
[53:29] to the situation that took the person
[53:32] home
[53:34] what i'm trying to say is
[53:36] how many people are healthy this morning
[53:38] raise your hand
[53:40] you all are healthy sister gin in there
[53:43] is in a better place more than you
[53:49] can i repeat it again
[53:51] if you are healthy you are sitting this
[53:53] morning sister jean is in the far better
[53:57] condition than you who are healthy
[54:02] not in reference to her sickness but in
[54:05] reference to this entire world she's in
[54:08] the far better condition than you
[54:12] you might be healthy today you can get
[54:14] sick tomorrow but sister gene will never
[54:18] never
[54:18] never again test what they call sickness
[54:24] if she comes back right now sickness
[54:26] won't do anything to her anymore
[54:30] [Applause]
[54:32] hallelujah brother branham says this
[54:35] inconvenience then concern
[54:37] brother branham say and i sinned
[54:40] let me go back again brother branham
[54:42] said that i've seen
[54:44] the people want that as that is going on
[54:48] i seen them there
[54:50] the old was water so if you have a
[54:53] vision of sister gene being old you got
[54:55] the wrong one
[54:58] hallelujah
[54:59] and they were standing there
[55:02] human beings just like i am only without
[55:05] water
[55:07] no more black dog
[55:08] on sister gene
[55:10] it's over
[55:11] with that sin it was beyond water
[55:16] are you beyond perfection here
[55:18] suffering to wake up in the morning
[55:21] sleeping waking up she doesn't even
[55:23] sleep
[55:25] hallelujah
[55:27] you could not mention what it is and
[55:29] when i knew that i had to return back
[55:32] there was only one thing
[55:35] that i would return
[55:37] to try to do what
[55:39] persuade people what the young witchy
[55:42] ruler was looking for
[55:44] whatever you do don't work
[55:47] don't
[55:48] don't
[55:49] three times you can't afford to miss it
[55:53] everything else let everything else go
[55:56] but make ready for water
[56:00] whatever you do
[56:01] so when she we say she's in a better
[56:03] place
[56:04] she's in a far better place than you who
[56:06] are healthy this morning
[56:08] she can no longer get sick
[56:10] she can no longer get trouble she can no
[56:13] longer get old
[56:18] hallelujah
[56:19] brother branham said i don't know what
[56:21] to call it he referred to it there as
[56:24] souls under the altar but when he was i
[56:27] have never there was no way to explain
[56:29] how great that is
[56:31] now you just have to take my word i'm
[56:34] just a man see but this vision
[56:38] that is always come to pass just as i
[56:40] have told you and you know there
[56:43] everyone has been true that it's true
[56:45] also whatever you do if you miss
[56:49] everything else
[56:51] health
[56:52] strength your eyesight whatever it is
[56:55] don't miss it
[56:57] there is nothing can compare with it
[57:00] there is no word in the english language
[57:03] that i know that could express it
[57:06] if you say perfect it is beyond that
[57:12] superb
[57:13] it's beyond that sublime there is no
[57:17] word that i know that could express
[57:20] because it was so then to think that
[57:23] it's not the end of it yet i thought
[57:27] maybe
[57:28] me be afraid to come to this
[57:30] because brother brother was afraid to
[57:32] die
[57:33] he usually wonder if you die what
[57:35] happened but when the lord took him to
[57:37] the sixth dimension and he saw what
[57:39] happened very branham look he said me
[57:42] again be afraid of this
[57:44] that's why paul say i'm praying i wish
[57:48] rather to be out of this tabernacle and
[57:52] to be in the presence of the lord then
[57:54] we who are still here that still have to
[57:56] struggle that still have to pray our
[57:58] ways through and make sure we are right
[58:01] with the lord before we meet him so our
[58:03] sister is in a better place she's happy
[58:06] ever to be happy she already preceded
[58:09] that she started before even we get
[58:11] there so she already started the party
[58:13] over there she's enjoying with brother
[58:15] branham she's enjoying with the same and
[58:17] one of this day he won't take too long
[58:20] not like paul we are right at the end of
[58:23] the end before you know it i won't be
[58:25] surprised if i see somebody ringing my
[58:28] door because over there you know more
[58:30] than what you know here
[58:32] she doesn't need a gps when she's coming
[58:34] back there she doesn't need to know even
[58:36] if i change a home she will know
[58:39] you say how how did peter recognize
[58:42] moses and elijah
[58:46] [Music]
[58:47] how did peter recognize moses and elijah
[58:51] who taught him he was moses and elijah
[58:53] how did the rich young ruler knew that
[58:55] was abraham
[58:56] because he was not born in the time of
[58:58] abraham when you get there there is a

[1:02:01] who's responsible
[1:02:05] it to for
[1:02:09] let's go to luke chapter 16.
[1:02:12] we're talking about the tongue in hell
[1:02:16] that's where we are if we finish here
[1:02:18] then we can go to the lake of fire and
[1:02:21] we can come up in the resurrection and
[1:02:23] you're going to see what a resurrection
[1:02:25] is
[1:02:28] i'm not going to say it let me just hold
[1:02:30] it you want to see the resurrection
[1:02:36] hallelujah
[1:02:38] 22. if you're there you can say a man
[1:02:41] and it came to pass that the beggar died
[1:02:44] you already understand you understand
[1:02:45] this now
[1:02:47] and was carried by the angels into
[1:02:49] abraham bosom
[1:02:51] this is paradise which was not up there
[1:02:54] it was below everybody clear
[1:02:56] there is three compartment in hell but
[1:02:58] paradise was below
[1:03:00] in other words when you go to hell
[1:03:03] you're not going there i'm not preaching
[1:03:05] you to go there
[1:03:07] hell is divided in three parts we
[1:03:09] already went through this the devil is
[1:03:11] right here
[1:03:12] at the very bottom
[1:03:14] this is the center of the devil
[1:03:16] and the theophany of the people that are
[1:03:18] not born yet from his kingdom
[1:03:20] we already went through this
[1:03:22] then the next one is the angel we
[1:03:24] already showed you this
[1:03:26] if you need more coach you see me
[1:03:28] and then the third one here is the
[1:03:30] region
[1:03:31] of the lost the lost here left here
[1:03:34] they were born like judah when they
[1:03:37] finished they come back up here but when
[1:03:39] they come they don't go here they stay
[1:03:41] right here
[1:03:42] these are the lost souls like the rich
[1:03:44] young ruler everybody clear
[1:03:47] but what
[1:03:48] luke chapter 16 is showing that at the
[1:03:51] top here it was divided in two
[1:03:56] there was a gulf here
[1:03:58] and this part here was paradise
[1:04:02] and this one was the region of the lost
[1:04:06] they went to paradise because the blood
[1:04:08] of good of bulls and goat was not able
[1:04:10] to bring them into the presence of the
[1:04:12] lord so hell have to pull them down
[1:04:16] when hell is pulling them down it was
[1:04:18] just a covering
[1:04:19] god have to put an extension
[1:04:22] even in hell
[1:04:24] between those that serve him and those
[1:04:26] that do not serve him anybody clear but
[1:04:30] when jesus died
[1:04:33] amen
[1:04:35] when jesus died
[1:04:36] jesus dropped and came here
[1:04:40] and preached to the souls in prison we
[1:04:42] already went through this i'm just
[1:04:44] rebooting the computers
[1:04:46] okay went to the souls in prison
[1:04:49] when he finished preaching to them not
[1:04:51] to be saved
[1:04:53] jesus dropped down here
[1:04:55] brother branham say
[1:04:56] usually when he was coming he was coming
[1:04:59] in his teal funny
[1:05:01] oh my i don't know if i'm gonna be
[1:05:03] preaching
[1:05:05] okay
[1:05:07] your theophany depends on where you came
[1:05:10] from
[1:05:11] we already preach about the origin
[1:05:14] okay
[1:05:15] if you come from god you have a
[1:05:17] different teopany
[1:05:18] if you're coming from the devil you're
[1:05:20] gonna have a different geophony
[1:05:23] the theophany of the devil doesn't
[1:05:25] change your age
[1:05:27] if you die at 10 years old you go there
[1:05:29] you're 10 years old
[1:05:31] if you need coach you see me if you die
[1:05:33] at 50 years old you go in this 50 years
[1:05:36] old but the theophany of god have only
[1:05:38] one age
[1:05:41] if you died here regardless of which age
[1:05:44] you die whether you are 2 or 90 or 50
[1:05:48] when you enter there it's only one age
[1:05:52] you remain young
[1:05:53] and god also have his own personal
[1:05:56] theophany and the theophany of god is
[1:06:00] called melchizedek
[1:06:02] [Music]
[1:06:05] everybody clear
[1:06:06] but the theophany could never go down to
[1:06:10] this region like this
[1:06:12] you follow me and go down to hell all
[1:06:14] the way down there because god is pure
[1:06:18] right
[1:06:19] so they needed to take the word
[1:06:22] the tiopani and send it to the
[1:06:24] headquarter of the devil
[1:06:27] but god cannot enter hell
[1:06:30] so god made a plan
[1:06:33] he took your sin
[1:06:39] he took my sin
[1:06:41] he took the sin of the entire world
[1:06:44] and he inoculated that to jesus
[1:06:49] so when jesus was dying
[1:06:51] jesus died like a sinner
[1:06:56] everybody clear
[1:06:58] so when you die as a sinner
[1:07:00] automatically you need to go to hell
[1:07:04] ever here
[1:07:06] jesus was not a sinner
[1:07:08] he died as a sinner by carrying our sin
[1:07:12] so when he died as a sinner his
[1:07:15] theophany came and detailed and he was
[1:07:18] melchizedek
[1:07:20] so jesus entered into mercy
[1:07:24] and took melchizedek to hell
[1:07:27] so the word enter hell
[1:07:30] the atomic bomb
[1:07:32] finally break into hell
[1:07:38] you okay
[1:07:39] so when jesus went down here when he was
[1:07:43] coming down in this area he was like a
[1:07:46] light between the cockroaches
[1:07:50] are you there when he was passing that
[1:07:52] region the demon just were starting away
[1:07:59] because the holy one was entering there
[1:08:03] and finally he came here brother branham
[1:08:05] said he knocked
[1:08:07] boom boom boom boom boom and the devil
[1:08:09] said who are you
[1:08:12] when the devil opened he said i was
[1:08:14] looking for you for so long
[1:08:17] i thought when i killed a boy i got you
[1:08:21] i thought when i killed moses i got you
[1:08:24] i thought when i killed joshua
[1:08:26] finally you are here
[1:08:28] the lord look at him
[1:08:30] and he reach out to his side
[1:08:33] and say satan give me those keys
[1:08:36] [Applause]
[1:08:42] hallelujah brother upon him say he smack
[1:08:45] him on the face
[1:08:48] are you there when the devil was on the
[1:08:50] floor
[1:08:51] the lord departed and began to rise
[1:08:54] right up here
[1:08:57] then there was another door here then he
[1:09:00] knocked at the door and when abraham
[1:09:02] opened up
[1:09:03] he said sarah come
[1:09:06] come quickly
[1:09:08] come quickly
[1:09:09] you know the man in genesis 18
[1:09:12] yeah he is
[1:09:14] [Applause]
[1:09:16] hallelujah
[1:09:17] hallelujah
[1:09:19] one job heard it
[1:09:21] job said father abraham push push push
[1:09:23] he said that was my redeemer
[1:09:26] i knew that one of this day he is coming
[1:09:30] [Applause]
[1:09:34] god the skin won't destroy my body now
[1:09:37] i'm going back to get my body
[1:09:40] is it yourself push your side
[1:09:43] he said that was the wheel in the middle
[1:09:46] of the wheel
[1:09:50] hallelujah
[1:09:52] hallelujah everybody saw him according
[1:09:56] to the personal revelation
[1:10:05] hallelujah
[1:10:06] he took them all up
[1:10:09] and he did he he finished with the
[1:10:12] paradise
[1:10:13] and he locked the
[1:10:15] the the the gate of paradise and say no
[1:10:19] more in existence
[1:10:22] [Music]
[1:10:24] in other words hell
[1:10:26] is different
[1:10:28] than it used to be by the presence of
[1:10:31] jesus christ
[1:10:34] so when christ come to your life
[1:10:37] he always make a difference
[1:10:40] even when he went to hell hell is no
[1:10:43] longer like the old hair
[1:10:47] [Applause]
[1:10:49] hallelujah under no circumstances a
[1:10:52] witch
[1:10:53] or a magician can pull sister gene out
[1:11:01] let's go to luke 16.

[1:11:36] because they were far away

[1:17:44] last week we talked about the tongue in
[1:17:47] hell everybody clear
[1:17:49] amen
[1:17:51] we are in the story of the rich young
[1:17:53] ruler
[1:17:54] and the rich young ruler is in hell if
[1:17:56] you can go with me in
[1:17:58] james chapter 3.
[1:18:00] that way we stop
[1:18:02] he's in hell
[1:18:03] and we found that in hell he's in
[1:18:05] torment
[1:18:07] and being that he's in torment
[1:18:09] there is one specific spot
[1:18:12] or member
[1:18:13] that this rich young ruler have pointed
[1:18:16] to us that in hell
[1:18:18] and he says that his tongue was the most
[1:18:22] place that was burning
[1:18:24] in hell
[1:18:25] why his tongue
[1:18:26] that's what we were trying to get and we
[1:18:29] got into it why in hell
[1:18:31] nothing else hurt more than the tongue

[1:19:26] if that will be perfect
[1:19:29] go
[1:19:30] and sell
[1:19:31] that
[1:19:32] that has and give it to the poor and
[1:19:36] thus shall have treasure in heaven
[1:19:39] in other words this which young ruler
[1:19:42] here was loaded
[1:19:45] he had
[1:19:46] a big luggage
[1:19:48] and when jesus looked at him
[1:19:50] he says there is a big luggage that you
[1:19:53] carry
[1:19:54] i want you to unload the luggage
[1:19:57] but your unloading of the luggage is not
[1:20:00] a loss
[1:20:05] [Music]
[1:20:08] when jesus asks you
[1:20:10] to take away something of your life
[1:20:14] you're not losing it
[1:20:19] are you with me
[1:20:20] when jesus gave permission to satan
[1:20:24] to go and take the children of job
[1:20:28] job was not losing his children
[1:20:34] are you there brother branham said
[1:20:35] that's the reason why god double
[1:20:38] everything but he never doubled the
[1:20:41] number of his children
[1:20:45] he doubled the earthly things
[1:20:47] because that was lost
[1:20:50] they need to be restored but he could
[1:20:52] not double the children because job will
[1:20:55] end up having nine children
[1:20:59] because the first one that job had were
[1:21:01] already saved
[1:21:05] here so god could not again dabble the
[1:21:08] children because by giving good job to
[1:21:11] uh our new children he was already
[1:21:14] doubling that
[1:21:15] [Music]
[1:21:17] it looks like the devil took the kids
[1:21:20] away
[1:21:21] but they were in the presence of the
[1:21:23] lord
[1:21:24] none of them were lost
[1:21:26] when god asks you to unload
[1:21:29] he doesn't let you unload to lose it
[1:21:32] [Music]
[1:21:34] god asks you to our lord
[1:21:38] he's unloading
[1:21:40] goes with an investment
[1:21:43] amendment
[1:21:45] [Music]
[1:21:46] are you there
[1:21:47] when you are lord he told the rich young
[1:21:50] ruler he said go ahead and sell that you
[1:21:53] have give it to the poor damn and what
[1:21:56] and that shall have treasure in water so
[1:21:59] the more he is given to the poor the
[1:22:02] more treasure he is gaining in heaven
[1:22:06] he is unloading on the earth but he's
[1:22:09] filling his bank accord in heaven
[1:22:16] take matthew chapter 16
[1:22:22] hallelujah how can somebody tell you
[1:22:25] give me a 10
[1:22:27] of your salary
[1:22:29] and you have a trouble with it
[1:22:31] not for the pastor
[1:22:33] i'm not saying that to put in my pocket
[1:22:35] you know me
[1:22:38] are you there
[1:22:40] but he said if you do that
[1:22:43] this is what i'm gonna do
[1:22:44] [Applause]
[1:22:47] they gave him two fishes and three bread
[1:22:50] the young kid unloaded his lungs
[1:22:53] [Music]
[1:22:57] what did he do
[1:22:59] [Music]
[1:23:02] if you keep it you lose it
[1:23:06] you give it to him
[1:23:08] [Music]
[1:23:11] matthew 16 verse 24
[1:23:14] if you did
[1:23:16] my god help me i don't know if i'm gonna
[1:23:18] touch the surface
[1:23:20] matthew 16 verse 24 if you dare you can
[1:23:23] say this
[1:23:25] then say jesus to his disciple if any
[1:23:28] man will come
[1:23:30] after me
[1:23:31] let him do what
[1:23:34] and take up his water
[1:23:36] and do water
[1:23:40] amen am i losing something
[1:23:42] let me see the next verse
[1:23:45] four
[1:23:46] who saw they will save his life
[1:23:49] everybody see that
[1:23:51] shall do what
[1:23:55] you want to save your life
[1:23:59] shall lose it and whosoever will lose
[1:24:01] his life for myself shall do whatever so
[1:24:04] you're not really losing anything
[1:24:08] you actually preserving something
[1:24:12] verse 26 for what is a man profited if
[1:24:16] he shall gain the whole world
[1:24:18] and lose his own water
[1:24:21] or what shall a man give in exchange to
[1:24:23] his water
[1:24:24] what else can you give it to him
[1:24:26] [Music]
[1:24:28] let's go to luke chapter 18
[1:24:33] as we're climbing
[1:24:35] slowly
[1:24:36] when the lord asks you to unload
[1:24:38] something
[1:24:39] you're not really losing it
[1:24:42] he's unloading
[1:24:44] and investing at the same time
[1:24:47] for your benefit
[1:24:50] luke chapter 8 uh 18
[1:24:52] let's go to verse 28.
[1:24:55] everybody clear
[1:24:57] then peter said no
[1:24:59] we have left water in other words we
[1:25:02] have unloaded everything
[1:25:04] i was a fisherman
[1:25:06] i was working you came you saw me you
[1:25:10] say you leave everything
[1:25:14] i left my family i left everything
[1:25:18] it looks like we always just follow you
[1:25:21] did i lose something
[1:25:23] [Music]
[1:25:24] peter said lo we have left all and
[1:25:27] followed you
[1:25:29] verse 29 and he said to them
[1:25:32] verily i say to you
[1:25:34] there is no man
[1:25:36] that has left water
[1:25:39] go look at the story of john sheridan
[1:25:43] [Music]
[1:25:44] god told him take that house and give it
[1:25:46] to somebody
[1:25:48] he become a multimillionaire
[1:25:49] [Music]
[1:25:52] he said there is no man that has left
[1:25:55] the house
[1:25:56] all parent
[1:25:58] all brethren
[1:25:59] all wife
[1:26:01] all children for the kingdom of god's
[1:26:04] sake
[1:26:05] who shall not receive manifold in other
[1:26:09] words many times
[1:26:11] more
[1:26:12] in the future time
[1:26:16] what did your bible say
[1:26:19] [Music]
[1:26:26] in the present time
[1:26:29] and in the world to come
[1:26:32] life water
[1:26:33] so when you lose something you're not
[1:26:36] really losing it
[1:26:38] you are actually investing
[1:26:41] and god is duty bound to pay you back
[1:26:45] and brother branham said god paid back
[1:26:48] very good
[1:26:52] brother i'm saying when you give god
[1:26:54] something he's going to give you a
[1:26:56] hundred thousand times
[1:26:59] i want him to have my children
[1:27:02] i want him to help my wife
[1:27:04] i want him to have my job
[1:27:06] i want him to have my business i want
[1:27:09] him to have this church
[1:27:11] i want him to help me
[1:27:13] because when our lord
[1:27:15] he gave him opportunity to bless me more
[1:27:21] [Applause]
[1:27:23] brother brother said god punch job
[1:27:26] to bless him more
[1:27:30] the rich young ruler they ask him to
[1:27:32] unload
[1:27:33] and come and follow me
[1:27:36] when god asks you to unload something
[1:27:39] not only is he investing that back
[1:27:43] but he also means that he have a new
[1:27:45] lord for you
[1:27:46] [Music]
[1:27:51] hallelujah
[1:27:53] god cannot remove something and leave
[1:27:56] you empty
[1:27:57] if god take the old nature out
[1:28:01] he has a new nature that he's trying to
[1:28:04] put in you
[1:28:06] so by you clinging to the old nature you
[1:28:10] actually blocking your blessing
[1:28:15] [Music]
[1:28:18] hallelujah
[1:28:20] hallelujah
[1:28:21] the bible says in the book of psalms
[1:28:24] chapter 37 and 37 the bible said mark
[1:28:28] the perfect man
[1:28:30] and behold the upright for the end of
[1:28:33] that man is what
[1:28:35] if this young rich ruler would have
[1:28:37] listened
[1:28:38] his end could have been
[1:28:44] but he didn't want to listen
[1:28:46] he said i got too much money
[1:28:48] i cannot do it so there is no way i can
[1:28:51] do it i need to move on let's go back to
[1:28:52] james chapter 3 now
[1:28:55] when god asks you to unload
[1:28:58] it's for an investment
[1:29:01] and for a job that he has for you
[1:29:04] this man did not understand that he has
[1:29:07] a gift to be an evangelist
[1:29:09] and god was trying to take his burden
[1:29:12] and put on him so he can carry a
[1:29:15] different load
[1:29:16] and gain everything else
[1:29:20] he want to keep his lord
[1:29:22] and he lost his reward
[1:29:25] everybody clear
[1:29:27] now james chapter 3 where we were
[1:29:30] let's move on
[1:29:31] brother david if you got triple a
[1:29:33] you can change this
[1:29:36] verse james chapter 3 verse 2.
[1:29:39] the bible say
[1:29:40] for in many things remember
[1:29:43] we offend all we talk about abraham we
[1:29:46] talk about job
[1:29:48] perfect
[1:29:50] if any man offend not in what
[1:29:54] in word
[1:29:56] the same is uh
[1:30:00] we're talking about the word
[1:30:02] and the perfect man
[1:30:04] everybody here
[1:30:06] last sunday
[1:30:08] we talked about job
[1:30:10] a perfect man we mentioned noah a
[1:30:14] perfect man
[1:30:15] we mentioned also uh uh abraham
[1:30:19] god asked him to walk and to be perfect
[1:30:22] and we found that everybody that was
[1:30:25] spoken about being perfect
[1:30:28] the devil tempted them
[1:30:30] by their mouth
[1:30:32] that's why the bible said in all of this
[1:30:34] job never never sinned with his water
[1:30:39] that's why the devil came back and said
[1:30:41] curse why did he want job to curse why
[1:30:44] didn't he want job to go drink why he
[1:30:48] didn't want a job to go do something
[1:30:50] else or kill somebody because god told
[1:30:53] the devil that job was a perfect man and
[1:30:56] a perfect man according to james is a
[1:30:59] man who know how to what to control his
[1:31:02] tongue everybody clear
[1:31:04] so we spoke about job we spoke about
[1:31:06] abraham let's bring another perfect man
[1:31:10] today
[1:31:11] and that man has also a stature called
[1:31:14] the stature of a what
[1:31:17] that meant his name is who
[1:31:20] jesus
[1:31:23] james says that if a man does not
[1:31:26] offending word
[1:31:27] he is a perfect man and there is no
[1:31:31] perfect man
[1:31:33] in this world
[1:31:35] that is more perfect than the lord jesus
[1:31:37] christ
[1:31:38] [Music]
[1:31:39] everybody clear
[1:31:41] and that man called the lord jesus
[1:31:43] christ
[1:31:44] he himself
[1:31:46] is the word of god
[1:31:48] [Music]
[1:31:50] the bible says in the beginning was the
[1:31:52] word
[1:31:53] and the word was with god
[1:31:56] and the word was who we explain you this
[1:31:59] the same was in the beginning with god
[1:32:03] all things
[1:32:05] were made by water
[1:32:09] and without him was not anything made
[1:32:13] that was made
[1:32:15] in other words him being the word
[1:32:18] created everything by the word
[1:32:24] so the word
[1:32:25] have a creative power
[1:32:31] hallelujah
[1:32:32] in hebrew 11 verse 3 the bible said
[1:32:36] through faith
[1:32:37] we understand that the
[1:32:39] world's plural
[1:32:41] we're framed by water
[1:32:44] so everything that we see here
[1:32:47] was generated by the world
[1:32:51] and a man who control his word
[1:32:55] that man is a perfect man
[1:32:59] hallelujah
[1:33:01] so that defeats which are seen
[1:33:04] were not made of things which do
[1:33:06] appear if i say hello
[1:33:10] did you see hello
[1:33:13] did you see hello
[1:33:14] if i said good morning do you see it
[1:33:17] you can hear it
[1:33:18] but you don't see it
[1:33:20] that word created things
[1:33:25] this desk here was created by an
[1:33:28] invisible voice
[1:33:31] [Music]
[1:33:32] hallelujah
[1:33:34] just like abraham when he went to trial
[1:33:38] abraham watched his mouth
[1:33:41] you remember last sunday
[1:33:43] job going to trial job also watch his
[1:33:47] mouth
[1:33:48] and this man also when he was put in
[1:33:52] trial he also was guarding his mouth
[1:33:58] hallelujah
[1:34:00] the bible says this
[1:34:02] oh my
[1:34:03] that
[1:34:04] first peter for even here until when he
[1:34:08] called because christ also suffered for
[1:34:11] us
[1:34:12] leaving us a water
[1:34:14] an example that you should follow his
[1:34:17] step
[1:34:18] what is the step we need to follow
[1:34:21] who did not water
[1:34:23] neither was what
[1:34:25] found in his water
[1:34:27] abraham lied
[1:34:30] [Music]
[1:34:37] himself
[1:34:38] job justified himself
[1:34:41] but jesus christ nobody could convince
[1:34:44] him of sin
[1:34:46] he was the sinless perfect lamb of god
[1:34:51] everybody clear
[1:34:53] who when he was without
[1:34:56] refound not again
[1:34:58] distract him they say prophesy he was
[1:35:00] just quiet watching them
[1:35:05] hallelujah when he suffered he
[1:35:08] threatened not
[1:35:10] he never said you will see
[1:35:12] [Music]
[1:35:13] hallelujah
[1:35:14] but committed himself to who
[1:35:18] to to who
[1:35:19] to him that judge righteously
[1:35:23] hallelujah
[1:35:25] isaiah said he was oppressed
[1:35:27] he was afflicted yet he did water
[1:35:32] a perfect man
[1:35:33] a man that knows how to control his
[1:35:36] tongue
[1:35:37] everybody
[1:35:39] he opened not his mouth
[1:35:41] his broad has a lamp to the slaughter
[1:35:44] and as a sheep before his shearer is
[1:35:47] what
[1:35:48] so he opened not his water
[1:35:50] yet marco the archangel when contending
[1:35:54] with the devil he disputed about he
[1:35:57] disputed about the body of moses does
[1:36:00] not bring against him a water
[1:36:02] a reeling accusation
[1:36:08] he didn't even want to insult the devil
[1:36:12] he could not say stupid devil
[1:36:15] crazy devil
[1:36:17] but what did he say but say the lord
[1:36:20] rebuked him
[1:36:23] clear
[1:36:24] a perfect man a man that knows how to
[1:36:27] control his water
[1:36:30] everybody clears so far
[1:36:31] now as we continue
[1:36:33] that attribute that was displayed
[1:36:37] by the control of this tongue
[1:36:40] is called temperance

[2:28:23] to use of water
[2:28:25] daddy man minister what
[2:28:28] unto them
[2:28:29] that's what you should use your tongue
[2:28:31] for
[2:28:33] hallelujah
[2:28:35] amen
[2:28:37] the bible said but fornication and all
[2:28:39] uncleanness and covetousness
[2:28:42] covetousness let it not be one's name
[2:28:44] among you as becoming sent
[2:28:47] neither water
[2:28:49] no
[2:28:51] no
[2:28:53] which are not
[2:28:54] but but rather giving water that's what
[2:28:58] abraham was doing
[2:28:59] remember last sunday
[2:29:04] but now he also put off this
[2:29:07] anger rough mannis blasphemy filthy
[2:29:12] out of y'all
[2:29:16] lord help me
[2:29:17] the horses
[2:29:19] the bible says here
[2:29:21] i will instruct thee and teach thee in
[2:29:24] the way which that shall go
[2:29:26] i will guide thee with man eyes
[2:29:29] be it not as though
[2:29:32] or as the
[2:29:34] which have no whose
[2:29:37] must be
[2:29:39] in with a beat and
[2:29:42] lest they come
[2:29:47] james says
[2:29:49] in verse 3
[2:29:50] we put bits
[2:29:52] in horse's mouth
[2:29:53] that they may obey us
[2:29:56] and we turn about their whole body in
[2:29:58] other words when we get their mouth we
[2:30:00] can move them whichever direction we
[2:30:02] want even if it's a fight the bombarding
[2:30:06] the horse will continue to go
[2:30:08] because he's breeder
[2:30:09] the one who won who's on him want to go
[2:30:12] to war so the horse is using the
[2:30:14] intelligence of the one that is there to
[2:30:17] accomplish his will because the horse is
[2:30:20] brother
[2:30:21] ever care
[2:30:22] now uh
[2:30:24] david is saying that when they put a
[2:30:27] beat on horse's mouth it's not only to
[2:30:30] obey him but to also bring the horse
[2:30:34] closer
[2:30:38] [Music]
[2:30:40] whose mouth must be held in with beat
[2:30:43] and brother lest they come
[2:30:46] we want a horse close to you
[2:30:48] breathe out his mouth
[2:30:50] he's going to come closer
[2:30:52] and then he's going to obey
[2:30:54] then you can control him
[2:30:56] what are you trying to say i'm going to
[2:30:57] close soon
[2:30:59] praise be the name of the lord
[2:31:01] by the bible says this and brother
[2:31:04] branham says this
[2:31:06] brother when i'm saying thank you
[2:31:07] brother neville good morning friends so
[2:31:09] happy to be here this morning and to
[2:31:11] have this introduction from the pastor
[2:31:13] that was very nice
[2:31:15] you know speaking of the horses you know
[2:31:18] putting their brother on them
[2:31:21] they know the work was
[2:31:27] so when
[2:31:28] god unloads you
[2:31:32] remember
[2:31:33] he's unloading with an investment
[2:31:36] for a new
[2:31:38] that's why to get you the new lord you
[2:31:42] need to control your tongue
[2:31:45] once he take a hold of the control of
[2:31:48] your tongue
[2:31:49] then they deposit the load
[2:31:52] the work
[2:31:54] brother of adam said putting the blood
[2:31:56] all over them they know the work was
[2:31:59] coming so once you put the brother on
[2:32:01] the horse
[2:32:02] they also understand that
[2:32:04] there is a load that i have to pick up
[2:32:07] well it is i'm just glad the lord made
[2:32:10] us a workhorse
[2:32:13] so we can work yet
[2:32:15] we are never never too tired to do
[2:32:18] something for the lord if he forced our
[2:32:20] lord to do it although being very water
[2:32:23] so the point here when you brother the
[2:32:26] tongue
[2:32:27] when you brother the mouth of a horse
[2:32:29] you bring him to obey you
[2:32:31] you bring him to come near to you and
[2:32:33] you want to give him a load
[2:32:35] that's what the which young ruler missed
[2:32:39] james said if any man among you
[2:32:43] seems to be religious and brother not
[2:32:46] his tongue
[2:32:47] but deceiveth his own
[2:32:50] this man religion is what
[2:32:52] so now you understand what it is
[2:32:54] to broaden your tongue
[2:32:56] where are you going
[2:32:58] the bible says in gems here chapter 3 he
[2:33:02] said behold we put bits in the horse's
[2:33:05] mouth
[2:33:06] that they may obey us and we turn about
[2:33:09] the whole body so to control the body
[2:33:13] you need to seize the tongue
[2:33:16] everybody
[2:33:18] so god also have a tongue
[2:33:23] everybody can
[2:33:24] everybody clear i'm heading straight to
[2:33:26] the airport
[2:33:28] god also have a tongue
[2:33:31] god has a mouth that's why the bible say
[2:33:35] men shall not live by
[2:33:37] but by every
[2:33:39] that proceeded out of the word
[2:33:42] so the mouth of god speak of the word
[2:33:47] [Applause]
[2:33:50] so if you can catch god in his mouth
[2:33:59] i'm gonna stop
[2:34:00] here if you can catch god in his tongue
[2:34:09] because a prophet
[2:34:11] is god's mouthpiece
[2:34:17] when the prophet speaks
[2:34:20] he's speaking god said the lord
[2:34:23] from god
[2:34:25] in other words the prophet gave you
[2:34:27] god's mouth
[2:34:29] [Music]
[2:34:31] if you can catch god's mouth
[2:34:34] or the message from the prophet
[2:34:37] if you catch it
[2:34:40] you can control the body of god
[2:34:43] [Applause]
[2:34:48] do you follow me
[2:34:50] do you follow me
[2:34:51] do you follow me
[2:34:54] [Music]
[2:34:57] i can tell you something
[2:34:59] i have to take it back
[2:35:01] many times because i'm just there
[2:35:04] your pastor can tell you things
[2:35:07] he has to take it back
[2:35:09] you can tell your neighbor things all
[2:35:11] your loved ones thinks you have to take
[2:35:14] it back but god
[2:35:18] cannot take his word
[2:35:26] [Music]
[2:35:27] the biggest mistake
[2:35:30] if i can call it a mistake
[2:35:33] because god doesn't make mistake
[2:35:35] but i'm trying to make a point
[2:35:37] the biggest mistake god can do
[2:35:40] is to let his word go to his child
[2:35:44] that's a mistake
[2:35:47] because god cannot take his word back
[2:35:49] again
[2:35:53] [Music]
[2:35:58] and if you understand that god wants to
[2:36:01] speak
[2:36:02] he can't say i'm sorry
[2:36:07] and you catch what he spoke
[2:36:10] [Music]
[2:36:13] god is in trouble
[2:36:24] i am trying to land the plane
[2:36:27] sooner you're gonna hear the the wheel
[2:36:29] of the airplane boom on the floor
[2:36:32] are you there
[2:36:33] god cannot take his word back
[2:36:36] he has to keep his word
[2:36:39] he has to keep it in order to be
[2:36:42] he cannot take back what he say
[2:36:46] he has to keep it his water
[2:36:50] [Music]
[2:36:56] oh my god
[2:36:57] i'm heading there
[2:36:59] oh my god
[2:37:01] god makes a promise god has to keep has
[2:37:06] to keep that promise
[2:37:08] oh
[2:37:09] i hope you see it
[2:37:11] if you could only understand church
[2:37:13] tonight

[2:37:24] of the world to bring pleasure to you
[2:37:27] you will not be seeking from one healing
[2:37:29] service to another you could take god
[2:37:32] where
[2:37:35] and know that it is
[2:37:43] hallelujah certainly when god makes a
[2:37:47] promise
[2:37:48] he cannot move from what
[2:37:51] in other words a dark word
[2:37:55] that's it
[2:37:58] that's it are you there he is duty bound
[2:38:03] to keep his water

[2:56:43] lord we are approaching you again humbly
[2:56:46] father thanking you for everything
[2:56:50] you have been doing for us
[2:56:52] that you such a great god
[2:56:54] that they carry them
[2:56:56] have to cover their faces
[2:56:59] cover further the hand
[2:57:01] cover their feet
[2:57:03] and to hear us
[2:57:05] describing you the way we are describing
[2:57:07] you they probably are amazed
[2:57:11] but we understand because we are your
[2:57:13] children
[2:57:15] we can approach you and call you papa
[2:57:16] god
[2:57:17] [Music]
[2:57:19] you came down in human flesh
[2:57:21] so that the god of the old testament
[2:57:24] that nobody could approach not even in
[2:57:27] the mountain
[2:57:28] if an animal could touch the mountain he
[2:57:30] should be killed
[2:57:32] but through you
[2:57:34] a prostitute could approach you
[2:57:39] and not only approach you touch your
[2:57:41] feet
[2:57:43] and wash them
[2:57:46] and wipe them
[2:57:48] without you even you moving
[2:57:50] without even any death
[2:57:53] until the religious world look and send
[2:57:56] and condemn you
[2:57:57] to be a sinner
[2:57:59] but they never understood
[2:58:01] that only a child
[2:58:03] can approach that way
[2:58:05] and you came to rescue those souls
[2:58:08] father this morning you spoke to us
[2:58:10] about our tongue
[2:58:12] you spoke to us about your own tongue
[2:58:15] and you spoke to us about the temperance
[2:58:17] you spoke to us about the control
[2:58:20] of our body
[2:58:22] lord we're so glad
[2:58:23] because your prophet says that it is not
[2:58:25] the temperance that we were born with it
[2:58:28] because our birth we was a mess to begin
[2:58:31] with but it's a temperance that is
[2:58:33] coming from the holy spirit
[2:58:35] the temperance that is god given
[2:58:38] that is birth into us without any effort
[2:58:41] lord because the spirit itself is a gift
[2:58:44] it's an unmerited grace lord that you
[2:58:47] came to our way and to save us our poor
[2:58:50] sinner lord like we were
[2:58:52] wretched in our ways of life and in our
[2:58:55] behavior and attitude lord but the god
[2:58:57] who is reaching mercy father you drop
[2:59:00] down and rescue us for the dart of the
[2:59:03] devil and father so that we can be the
[2:59:05] righteousness of god
[2:59:07] lord i'm praying for this church
[2:59:10] i'm praying for your children i'm
[2:59:12] praying for those that will be streaming
[2:59:13] lord father or maybe they are streaming
[2:59:16] right now or those that will catch up
[2:59:18] later that father may you granted unto
[2:59:21] them that temperance
[2:59:22] may you give them lord father may you
[2:59:25] birth that ability that virtue into them
[2:59:28] that will help them control their tongue
[2:59:30] because the devil has been using their
[2:59:33] tongue to bring trouble in their life
[2:59:36] they have been confessing things
[2:59:38] speaking things not knowing lord that
[2:59:40] the course of their life has been put in
[2:59:43] jeopardy because of their problem their
[2:59:45] own confession but now lord father upon
[2:59:49] the blood of the atonement i pray that
[2:59:52] every word
[2:59:53] every confession that was spoken to your
[2:59:56] children
[2:59:57] before this day that was negative in
[3:00:00] their life maybe they donate consciously
[3:00:04] or unconsciously father maybe they've
[3:00:07] done it because they were pushed into
[3:00:09] anger into wrath they say things that
[3:00:12] were not correct and they are victim of
[3:00:15] their suffering today because of the
[3:00:17] things that are spoken upon the power of
[3:00:20] the lord jesus christ we break all those
[3:00:23] curses
[3:00:24] we break all those powers may further
[3:00:27] those chains of darkness
[3:00:29] be completely turned loose from their
[3:00:32] life
[3:00:32] may further you give them a tongue of a
[3:00:36] ready rather lord like david who could
[3:00:39] say that my heart is indicted with good
[3:00:43] mother may you feel them with good words
[3:00:46] that they can speak life to their
[3:00:48] children
[3:00:49] life to their family life to their loved
[3:00:51] one life to their job life to their
[3:00:54] business life to their health those that
[3:00:57] are struggling regardless of what they
[3:01:00] are struggling may they be positive in
[3:01:02] their talk may further you help us

[3:01:08] and be able like abraham be able like
[3:01:11] the roman centurion be able like the
[3:01:14] syrophoenician woman to be able to take
[3:01:16] you at his at your word and father to
[3:01:19] bring you so that we can get the full
[3:01:21] benefit of that which you die for on
