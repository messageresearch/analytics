time amen let me see your hand again okay somebody is sleeping up oh my god okay blessed be the name of the lord amen how many are reading the cod book how about the church ages okay great improvement blessed be the name of the lord remember this coming saturday lord's willing brother robert at 2 30 at 2 30 we have our house meeting for question and answer so if you still have some questions please put it on the box before by wednesday we should have everything there amen so don't send me the question at the last minute on saturday morning amen okay so make sure you got your question and put it in the box it's going to be at the clubhouse we've been there before but check your email your text message you should be able to see the the address amen how many read the roof chapter 2 okay all righty you didn't he read it bless your heart the trustee told me to remind you that we have uh building funds today amen so they will take care of that at the end of the service i could not finish the message on wednesday wednesday was very short it's always it's very good but very short for me and i'm always under pressure but the main core was already given so there are three courts that i had to deliver but the time was already over so you give me about five seven minutes i have to deliver those code so make sure everything is locked and there is no [Music] loose nut somewhere amen you'll be all right don't worry all right we spoke on wednesday on ruth and the calvinism now you understand what it is right so if you find yourself under preaching under a camp or whatever click you need to come up let's stay with the message amen the brothers remain brothers we shake hands we're good we keep the fellowship but we're not under any move in this church did you hear me in other words i don't have the headquarters that i have to report to you i preach what the lord put in my heart i'm not preaching to please somebody or a click somewhere i'm preaching to stay with what brother branham say and what the bible says period so if you're coming under a certain doctrine and you want me to preach a certain way it's not going to happen i only have one boss amen brother branham said he believed in the supreme authority of the local church amen the only person i must make sure i am really lined up with is brother branham that's all everybody here so we found out that the calvinist was an error of a lot of fact a lot of fighting a lot of contention and a lot of clicks everybody clear if you own my clique you're going to be invited if you're not on my clique you're going to stay there hallelujah brother branham says because it's an era with a lot of doctrine and if you remember it's an era when the book print began to go and when the books were going the children of god were coming they were younger they were looking for the bread to grow instead of giving them bread the pulpit forgot they got into the fasting into the clique and the children that were growing up begin to suck onto the fastest of the message instead of growing and later on no holy ghost fasting keep continuing camp continue 20 years 40 years doctrine amen brother branham says satan does not care how religious you are anybody care oh how right you are in your water how many people believe that doctrine are right in the message satan doesn't care about it everybody here he said if you miss that life you can get in your clicks in your preferred preachers or in your camp as long as you miss that life satan doesn't care about you you don't even bother him you can continue fasting for 30 years he's fine as long as you miss that life you won't come up the doctrine is right but the doctrine won't pull you out of the grave you won't come up anywhere anyhow no matter how religious how how good how many churches you belong to or will belong to it doesn't matter one thing unless you have been water must be in the holiest that's what shake the devil anybody care brother branham continues he says now i says to brother sis brother ness to answer your question that says now i don't take i do not take either side with you brethren and i know as long as you fuss you are above water two preachers fasting brother branham comes he says i'm not going to take side on neither of you as long as you're fasting it automatically showing me both of you are wrong anybody care but bottom say because i would rather be wrong in my water and writing my water then to be right in my and wrong in my water roof under calvinist wrong heart good doctrines everybody here everybody brother branham say i said after all it is your heart condition the holiest and i made that a practice to know this that if a man no matter what he does and how much we difference and what he says about me if in my heart not from just a water roof serving we will get to that but from my heart i can't love that man as well as i love anyone else then i know there is something wrong with you've been under the doctrine have your heart been changed all it takes is somebody push you to the edge you find out you don't have the holy ghost amen brother bottom say and the pentecostal people you are doing the same thing trying to pick him up by organization you shall never do it separating yourself from another brother from other brothers you got to come back and we got to be i don't care if the man is wrong roof and the calvinist if he's wrong and sincere in his water that's what matters and you are right in your belief and you are wrong in the acting of your way you are acting in other words if that person is wrong in his doctrine and his heart is correct and you the knowing of the big shot you are writing your doctrine but your heart is wrong brother branham said this is what i would like brother branham says i'd rather be in his place than be in water [Music] that is right i'd rather be wrong in my doctrine and right in my water god will respect it more so if a man is wrong what of it do what what do the clique do denomination separating brotherhood why he doesn't belong to us he doesn't preach like us he should remember with the elders we respect the elders we bow down before the elders but i stand on my position amen let's go to our let scripture sink in so get up from your message clicks from your message camp i'm not saying do not listen to another minister that's not what i'm saying i believe in a far-flung ministry we will continue to bring preachers here we love them the brothers but no clique no click in this church no click outside of this church anybody care no clicks no move we're not in any move here in this church no move we're not promoting anybody here we're promoting trust the message of the hour period hey mark here first king chapter 17 this thing is loaded my friend so [Music] relax amen if you're there you can say amen hallelujah don't sleep your time of grace is over the deacon will gently we may i remind you that it's not a bedroom i already told you i'm just reminding you you know you have a problem with sleepiness you stay on the back there so nobody will get embarrassed if you come fasting at me i will remember you i pull youtube and i put that say i already told you twice it's right first king chapter 17. verse 8 and the word of the lord came to him saying eraz i promise to go back to rehab but let's keep rehab down the road eras gets you to zarepha which belongs to zadon and dwelter behold i god have commanded a married woman you might be seated was ruth married again she was water all right now we start working amen i have commanded a we the woman there to sustain thee in other words to provide for you so he elijah arose and went to zarepha and when he came to the what are you reading do you see something when they teach you math in school they don't teach you math to just memorize they teach you math you see the teacher going to the board and demonstrate and demonstrate and demonstrate what the teacher is actually demonstrating there is a concept behind it all they want you to do is to catch the concept when you catch the concept they can change numbers are you with me they can change data you can still solve the equation because you already grasped the concept everybody here so you know how we go through surgery in this church so the more we do in it we're doing it you need to start learning now when you're reading the scripture there is a certain way you're reading the scripture you cannot continue to read the scripture the same way you were reading after everything we went through [Music] all right so verse 10 so he arrows and went to sarifa and when he came to the water do you see something there he came to the gate so this woman was closer to something he came to the gate of the city behold the widow woman was where where are we okay can you read it okay thank you she was there gathering of sticks how many sticks more than one sticks plural how many we'll find out but somebody already got the answer so somebody's reading the bible or listening to the message amen gathering of stick and he called to her elijah and say bring me i pray you a little water okay now it's wonderful okay i see smile coming up so i know praise god bring me water have you seen it you still have not seen it how many people saw it how many people did not see it you didn't see it praise god you know this picture right what is here did you see it what is here the brazen altar what follows it what is in the lever h2o ever here when you enter here what do you see here and what else and the altar of incense and the ark of the covenant anybody here so you see the gate right so you see in the water right okay praise god amen bring me i pray you a little water in a vessel that you may drink that i may drink in other words if you have nuts and if you're still struggling if i'm standing here i tell you bring me water where are you going to get the water you so now you got it right okay verse 11. and now she was going to bring it he called to her and say bring me i pray you a water where do you find bread in the tabernacle you want to go home did i lose anybody [Music] where is the bread okay okay i like that so we got now to the bread brother robin the seals are something else amen blessed be the name of the lord so elijah asks for water and the woman turn around to go get so she has it are we okay she already got water so elijah understood the language then elijah pushed forward he said give me are we okay because elijah found her taking the sticks and but here we will find out how many sticks are there then elijah said okay what does she have in her hand sticks by the rabbit and elijah said give me water the woman turned around to get water elijah say okay she got water give me bread okay i'm gonna help you okay somebody got okay somebody got it okay you got it [Laughter] bring me afraid you a morsel of bread in your hand and she said as the lord liveth i have not a water but a handful of water meal in a barrel a marquee and a leader or elena cruz and behold i'm gathering how many sticks so now we got two sticks uh brother branham [Laughter] you need more you let me know a voice speaks and say go out in the yard and get water this is not written clearly in the scripture you need a prophet to bring this out so brother branham is telling you this woman didn't just go out like that somebody told her go gather two sticks did you notice the scripture says how many sticks which means water what does this represent the president what the president represents water so when elijah came he found a woman where with how many tooths how many sticks elijah said bring me water she said i have water and i just said bring me water she's already there she can serve which stage is she any any question that i may go and dress it for me and my son that we may eat and do what and elijah said to her fear not go and do i want you to do service you need to serve me roof [Music] do as you have said but make me there for a little cake first you must serve me first must serve elijah first there is an interaction between elijah and a weird woman [Music] they have to talk right first and after make for you and for your water son for that save the lord god of israel the burial of meal shall not waste neither shall the crews of all fair water fail not until the day that the lord sent what rain upon the water the meal and the oil that this woman had could waste are we okay the meal that the woman have if she keep it that was the last one it can go and that's it and no more anybody care the meal and the oil the woman had if she makes it to bread that bread if it takes too long you have an expiration date everybody okay the manner when you eat it at the end of the day you have an expiration date are we okay then elijah bring another food [Music] and the food of elijah it doesn't waste anybody here we know in the tabernacle if you keep mana here something will happen to your mana but if you take mana over there there is no aspiration everybody here the first food was there in the holy place but the second one was a different food it's a food that is created you take it it comes back up because god told moses take only a little vessel and put the manner but the priest could go eat and that man is still there every priest you come you eat you go back the man is still there everybody here and the meal that elijah brought by the spoken word is a meal that doesn't go away when you eat another meal when you eat another meal i'm here that's safe the lord let's move into here [Music] everybody okay let's go to proverbs 10. it's called the tabernacle language you've seen it in rahab you've seen it in paul you've seen it all over amen you can go all the way you will see it going on amen why didn't eliezer gave rebecca quickly what she wanted he wanted rebecca to work first and elias waited for her to do the work until she watered the camel then he pulled the earring after work and pulled the bracelet and put it together after she works after she served a roof serving everybody proverb 10 verse 16. if you're there you can say amen the labor of the rapture stand to water so the labor of the righteous will bring her we will bring that righteous person toward life the labor the labor serving the labor of the righteous will bring that righteous to life the labor of the righteous will bring the righteous to life that labor is going to move you you gotta do the work then it moves you to a different stage rehab must do something about the spice then he move her to the token roof must serve before resting the labor of the righteous tend to life the fruit of the wicked to what we're not there let's go to philippians chapter 2 then we're going to pray i hope nobody's failed yet if you feel we need to take you to the doctor those were some roles that they bring at the restaurant while you're waiting for the food appetizer all of those stuff philippians chapter 2 if you're there you can say amen verse 12. the bible wherefore my beloved as you have always obeyed not as in my presence only but now much more in my absence do water your own water how can you work your salvation how can you work your salvation so you want to do something to be safe work out your own salvation not the salvation of your neighbor your own salvation with what and trembling so brother stephen i need now to do work praise god i'm gonna make myself this way make myself this way you you did it for a long time didn't take you no way only major is a big hypocrite so how do you do the work i can go deep now because something is there's a lot here we're going to get to roof under sanctification then roof under wesley then we keep moving amen how do you work verse 13 for it is me [Music] paul said work out your salvation and paul turn around he said it is god the same one that pick up the glass is the same one that's going to clean up the glass it's the same one that's going to fill the one that called you the one that justify you that gate is going to turn into a door and that door is going to turn into a veil everybody here so it is god which works in you both to what that that desire that is coming up it is him [Music] not you you will know that this is nominee this is somebody else because if it's me i would not do something like this it is him that bring the will and the water and they do so it's not a pharisee work because the pharisee when they do they remember everybody here but the rapture is when jesus tells them that when i was sick you came and visit me they don't remember they say when when were you seeking then we came and see you they didn't remember everybody here but the one the other one said lord have we not cast devil in your name have we not prophesy they know the other one doesn't remember it's a nature they were just living they thought it was them that were living they found out that it was not them they were living because the faith that they were living with was not them anymore that's why paul said it is not i who is living now i live by the faith of the son of god the life that i leave now it's not me paul anymore because paul was a murderer over there ever here blessed be the name of the lord he said to do of his good water so that sanctification you do it but it's not you doing it that's right but you do it how can i do something that is not me doing it how can you do it let's go to roof chapter 2 and then we pray alleluia if you dare you can say a man amen let's pray now heavenly father lord we thank you again father for your grace for your love your mercy father and for everything you have been doing for us lord you have given us another opportunity to be here to gather together around the revealed word of the hour father i have done what any man that you give an ability to do can do we can read the word and father people can hear it and listen to it but father when it comes to ministering to your people and to unfold your word it only take the action of the holy spirit lord i am completely 100 dependent upon you father may you move me completely out of the way may you come and bless our soul and minister to this church lord and to those that are not here and streaming lord father may your presence continue to minister and unfold your word to your children to bring forth healing in the name of jesus christ amen all right one more scripture in exodus chapter 25 verse 31 just a reminder the bible says that shall make a candlestick of pure gold we talk about it on sunday we mentioned that on sunday of bidding work shall the candlestick be made there is some beating there his shaft his branches his ball his knobs and his flower shall be all the same when you look at the candlestick it looks beautiful made out of gold it's shining it looks great but there was a lot of building to bring that beauty out here now we are today this morning in the four phases of roof roof at the candlestick hey here we are in the tabernacle you see it on the board there you enter the tabernacle passing the tribe of judah then you pass into the priest after the priest you enter the gate when you enter the gate you find the two sticks everybody okay then you go to the water ever here and from there we put roof under justification and brother branham came again and he said rule founded justification means roof under luther on the sanctification on the westlake and then on all the way to the message of the hour amen then we found that luther has a baby a big one a tribal baby that we call calvin and with the stage of kevin the church miss that the one who is under justification is really a baby or an infant and he needs a different food than the doctrine in hebrews 5 12 the bible says for when for the time you ought to be teachers you have need that one teach you again which be the first principle of the oracle of god so there is something here paul is calling the first principles the first principles of the word or the oracle of god what is the first principle of the word of god amen paul say and i become such as have made of milk and not of water so there is two food the first one is milk and you know who's responsible for the milk we're talking about we're dealing with babies and the second one is strong meat amen and the calvinist they went straight to the strong meat and they forgot the church needed milk and this is the error that happened in a message everybody here if you look at brother branham brother branham never started his ministry and preached the seals brother bonham started with the first pool with the healing and the miracle and going to the teaching all the way the seals were almost at the end of brother branham life there was a reason why the seals have to be down there because the milk have to go first then you bring the strong meat later on when a child is growing up amen and paul continued he said for everyone that uses milk is a skillful in the word of righteousness anybody care for he is a water he's a baby are you giving a baby a stick this is what they did in the message everybody here but strong meat belong to them that are of full age even those who by reason of use have their senses already exercised to discern both water and water they know what is the difference between good and evil those can get the strong meat everybody we can start with the unchanging pattern of god in order to rebuild the altar of malachi 4 we can emphasize on some of the doctrine in order to rebuild again the confidence in the cloud and in everything everybody here and once we reach the referee the lord push a break he says they are still babies down there go back into the black dog territory and begin to clean up the church first i hope you're listening in hebrew chapter six verse one the bible says therefore leaving the principles remember the principles of the doctrine of who let us go on to water the principle here paul says that they are milk anybody here and here you're moving toward perfection everybody but what are the principle of the word of god paul says living the principles of the doctrine of christ let us go on to perfection not laying again the principles which are the principle not laying again because we already laid that we don't want to go back again and keep digging there not laying again the water the foundation of water repentance happened where the principle of the doctrine of christ everybody okay paul saying we need to move toward perfection you cannot remain baby anymore for eternal you cannot be baby 20 30 years in a message we cannot continue to go back here back there back there you baptize one time here and let's move forward anybody okay not lying again the foundation of repentance the present altar from dead work the brazen altar amen and the fifth word god the brazen altar and of the doctrine of water do you see that deliver so this right here the other court belongs to babies because you are just new in the gospel you need milk not the feast of the trumpet anybody here and laying on the fend and the resurrection of the dead and eternal judgment it is necessary this is what you get there ever here and peter said as newborn babies desiring the water the sincere milk of the word that she may do water that's what you need in the other quarter here when you plateau then we gotta move to you and begin to give you some bread anybody here so far so they missed this and they caused a lot of problem because they went through the doctrine and they forgot that the church was coming to learn how they can live with their wife how they can live with their children how they can be good people when they get there the clergy is fighting left and right and the people miss the life and they grew up with doctrine and they still fasting till today but no life living like devils at home but here then under westlake we found our minion so brother branham says this as we begin to go now that roof deciding roof serving roof resting deciding was justification serving was making herself ready in serving i'm catching up from sunday is roof making herself ready another word roof preparing herself everybody here brother branham says this again we move on to roof going into the holiest we're dealing with it brother branham says this he said then after she got there the next thing she has to do was to serve in the field of boas for you to serve you must be in the field of boaz why boas because boaz was the king's man with him anybody care you cannot go anywhere number two brother branham say out there she was barefooted so it was not easy bear footed and brother branham said she had to glean behind the reapers everybody here praise be the name of the lord now to help somebody because last sunday i have to go twice with it buckle up pretty good when we're talking about somebody showing you remember that sunday okay or somebody who's planting my brother who is on the computer make sure you stay there so when they go home they can watch it they can review it when somebody is sowing there is a mystery that goes into the ground you're the one going slowly with me anybody care if you look under there if you pull the ground everybody here when you have a seed and you cast your seed on the ground everybody okay the seed doesn't stay like that after a while the seed will begin to sink everybody okay then you begin to sink then the seed will sink completely in everybody okay when he sink completely in this seed here have life in it but if you take the seed you put it right here that life will remain in the sea then never move on everybody here in this stage there is still life there but you don't see the life here but when the seed is completely sink into the ground the seed will rot in other words the seed dies everybody okay so far i'm trying to help you from last sunday and when the seed dies after a while you think everything is done no the death of the seed is the releasing of the life everybody here as long as the seed remains seed the life is blocked everybody here for the life to live the seed the seed must die and when he dies it's going to release the life that was in it and once the life is released then what come out something will shoot up everybody okay then after the process of time something else shoot up the blade the tassel everybody care then after the process of time we begin to find a mature wheat ever here but in between this stage here and the other stage here there is a stage that something is formed that is called the shock the shark looks like the seed but it is not the seed the shark is an empty seed everybody here if you look you will think you got the seed when you open there is nothing there it is just a protective layer ever here to protect like an anki bedo like a womb that the seed is using until the seed is fully formed then the seed the baby comes out amen everybody okay so far everybody okay so far so when somebody who's not trained correctly look at the shack they will think that they got the seed and they take and they begin to tell the people i got the seed and one day you're going to open up you found out you didn't have the seed you only have the shack anybody here all right blessed be the name of the lord so when i don't know where this is coming from jesus can you close that the devil and do you see where he's dead that's exactly where i am everybody here so with this seed when it reach maturity they bring the sickle or the instrument and then they cut the seed and they make a sheath everybody okay this process this journey of the wheat that you see from here all the way here is exactly a reflection of the church ages anybody here if you notice over here everything is yellow but the ground is dark everybody okay so far if you notice right here you will find everything is white but you see darkness begin to come out there in other words the seed is sinking everybody okay on the next stage you will see the seed sinking more on the third it's sinking until the fourth it dies completely it is sinking anybody okay then it begin to come up then come up then come up all the way to the harvest anybody clear so far jesus says this that verily verily i say unto you except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and do whatever he will lay by the lawn anybody okay but if he dies he bring more water so the depth of the corner with is important in in john chapter 11 verse 15 caiaphas says this he says no consider that it is expedient it is necessary it is very important for us that one man should die for the people and that the whole nation perished not and this spoke he not of himself but being high priest that year he did what so the one who says this was god amen amen he was not careful so according to god the death of jesus christ is important it is important for the whole nation that jesus should die for that nation and not for that nation only which is israel anybody but that also he should gather together in what children of god that were water in other words the the the death of jesus christ is a blessing to us when jesus died he released the god that was in jesus christ [Music] and that god that was locking jesus christ now can go everywhere not only to the jewish only but even to the gentile and begin to search the children of god according to the lineage of melchizedek everybody okay so far john 16 verse 7 nevertheless i tell you the truth it is expedient for you that i do what it was expedient for him to die and it is also expedient for him to go away this going away was his rapture it is also expedient for you that i go away for if i go not away the who the life because when he came from the grave he picked up the life again nobody can receive it so what do we do you must go when he goes he will ease that life and that life come back in the church everybody here it is expedient for you that i go away for if i go not away the comforter the holy ghost will not come upon you but if i depart my rapture i will do what i will send him unto you so the death and the rapture is important everybody okay let's continue brother branham say he died in the dark ages down beneath the dark dead they thought he was gone saint john 12 4 24 jesus said except a corn of wheat fall in the ground he abides alone and the first church was the reproduction that brad that seed that word made manifest that fell into the ground in water in rome brother obama says a corn of which fall into the ground now jesus was that corn of wheat that fell into the ground which after was made perfect he had life in it in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god and in that world was life and that life was the light of man you remember now okay but this perfect one that reflected the word in every age every word he lived by they put him in the grave but three days he broke her open and come out again hey mark here so when jesus christ died his death is important his burial is important his resurrection is important but once the corner which is resurrected after the death they got to take it somewhere everybody okay jesus says this that a believer john doe baptist says whose fan is in his hand he will thoroughly purge his floor and gather his wheat into the water garner but he will burn up the shelf with unquenchable fire the gunner is born the gardener is another word for born this is where you keep the seed everybody here so when the seed that you have you plant it it dies you produce you take the end product into the burner everybody okay amen matthew 13 let both together let both grow together until the harvest in the time of the harvest i will send the reapers gather you together fetch the tears burn them in the binder to be burned to burn them but gather the wheat into water here it's called garner here it's called water so when the wheat is put into the barn he has two missions [Music] anybody okay either this sweet will be used for bread [Music] everybody here and part of this seed will be used for sowing in other words to aerate again the ground so we can produce more so some will be turning to bread and some will keep it to plant them over again so when jesus died and rose again they retrieve him from the father and they put him back into the barn ever here and they pulled the life that was in jesus christ and they planted back again everybody okay so far when they planted he came down with paul right here boom and then that life will begin to go until the end everybody okay so to make everything easy for you we have a sower that is planting after he planted we got a field after the field then we got the harvest everybody clear now that which is in this bed which has been spread here ever here came from the barn [Music] everybody okay it is a seed anybody here and what you see in the office here it is exactly what came out of the barn anybody care so their harvest bring you back to the original everybody okay the difference is in the planting you have one seed everybody okay so far but in the harvest you have the same seed in multiplication you put one but you have many you kill one jesus on the day of pentecost 120 jesus everybody okay jesus became multiplied because when the pillar of fire met a paul on the road to emmaus the penal fire told paul what paul paul so why are you what was paul persecuting jesus christ he was persecuting who the church became jesus christ but it was jesus christ in many members not one person but now it's many seed [Music] everybody okay so far amen so what is this seed here what is it luke chapter 8 verse 11 the bible say now the parable is this the seed is the water any question first peter 1 23 being born again not of corruptable water seed but of incorruptible by the water which liveth and the blood of water so this seed here is the word of god and whatever you start with it over there in the planting is going to be exactly what you get in the harvest you going back again to the original planting to the original faith [Music] everybody okay the faith that you started here we'll go down through the edges and come back again the same thing ever here now we are in the tabernacle we're dealing with roof in the holy place as we put our microscope we pull again again again the holy place like we did last sunday we know that the holy place depending on how you look at if you got according to hebrew the holy place have only the candlestick and the table of the showbread but we know that according to moses moses put the altar of aces which we already talked about it anybody here now we're dealing with roof under the candlestick everybody okay roof chapter two remember last sunday that what move naomi everybody okay to go back to the promised land was not the death of her husband he was not even not he was not the death of her children it was the he was the news that bread is back again in israel the news didn't say that wheat is in israel then you say that it's bread in other words by bread we mean that the wheat is already mature okay but the death of marlon was necessary because your first husband must die everybody here you already know this by last sunday amen and we found out that when naomi returned with roof and her mother-in-law when she begin her daughter-in-law she began to return on the cuff from the country of moab the bible said they came to bethlehem the center of bread in the beginning of barley harvest where are you going with this candlestick we already talked about this on sunday i'm just keeping this is where we were now we understood that the office or the farming have certain principles this is where we were in the farm everybody okay we have let me get it here so we go pretty quick probably pretty quick here we have according to john chapter 4 we got two seasons amen we got the planting season and we got the harvest everybody here because jesus says that he that reapeth receiveth his wage and gathered fruit unto life eternal but both he does soweth the planter and he that reaped may we judge together and hearing is that saying true one so f and one other reaper i sent you to reap that where on you bestow no level at the main library and you enter into their ever here so the one who's sewing and the one who is reaping are two different people but both of them are put together in one set everybody okay and according to matthew chapter nine the bible says that the harvest is truly plenties but the laborers are few pray he therefore the lord of the harvest so the harvest according to matthew have the lord of the harvest not the lord of the planting everybody here and he will send forth laborers into his water so this lord is not alone he have workers all liberals everybody care and we know that these workers and laborers are in category you remember that don't worry we'll get there amen amen now paul in 1st corinthians chapter 3 says i have done water everybody okay we got moses and who elijah we got paul and who brother branham and when you go back to the jews what do you have again moses and who in one transfiguration what do you have and who everybody okay so there is a planting season and there is a harvest season ever here the planting season will have the seed the harvest also have the seed and jesus said one wool plant and the other one will be doing water harvesting but here and we found paul says that i have planted because when naomi was still in the land of moab when malone died everybody care they didn't move everybody they moved in the time of the harvest ever here so the death of marlon here was the time that they were planting something in israel and the planting correspond with the death of the husband anybody here and paul is the one that says that your first husband must die and paul is the one that says that i'm me paul i have planted so paul was a planter but who is in the harvest anybody okay paul says that i have planted apollos dead water what does it mean paul is the one that planted but apollos did what did apollos plant the one who is watering doesn't pamper with the seed [Music] because when you are born under a messenger when you are a baby remember on wednesday you cannot deviate from the right or the left you must stay with what moses is already saying joshua you stay with what moses gave you if you want to prosper if you want to have success in your ministry you must stick with the law of moses you remember wednesday you don't temper with the law all you do is you order what moses already planted [Music] what does watering mean amen why do we have to water paul let's go to second peter and then we're going to go back to ruth chapter 2. let's go to second peter why do we have to water paul why we didn't leave paul leaving the seed and living alone why watering paul ii peter chapter 3 paul already planted just leave the seed there and go everybody okay hallelujah you there second peter chapter three if you're there you can say amen verse 15. everybody here paul say i have planted but apollos is watering do you know who apollos was you know that right okay apollos is doing what watering apollos is not planting because apollos doesn't have a seed that's right not everybody have the seed the spoken word is the original seed the preacher are unique the seed comes from the husband everybody okay paul say i planted apollos water what is wrong with the watering why do we have to water paul let's go to 15. on account or consider that the long-suffering of our lord is salvation everybody even as our beloved brother who brother paul also according to the wisdom given to who has written to you this is peter talking to the church he said consider that what god is doing is for your salvation just like paul peter is calling paul peter is a minister but he's quoting paul peter started with jesus christ but he's quoting paul come on he says paul have a certain wisdom that was given to him and he wrote to you certain things why do we need to water paul verse 16 as also in all his what the episodes of who of paul speaking in them of these things in which are some things water to be water paul peter is saying that paul when you read him there are certain things that paul writes there are certain sermons of power that are hard to understand am i reading a different bible spoil has a hard sherman sometime you put it you listen you don't understand anything everybody okay they are hard to be understood come on which day that i want and on what and learn and unstable do what twist as they do also the other word there is the sermon of paul everybody okay the sermon of paul or the epistles which are the letters of paul and the scripture let's go back again let's go back again i'm trying to let this sink let's go back again in which are some things so hard to be understood come on which day that are unlearned an unstable twist as they do also are the water peter is putting the sun man of poor together with the scripture [Music] the sermon of a prophet are connected with the scriptures and peter said there are certain people that are unknown and what they do they twist the scripture and by this habit of twisting the scripture they also have a tendency to twist the sermon of paul and when they twist the sermon upon what happened everybody here as they do also are the scripture to their own water so by misinterpreting the prophet you bringing destruction to the people [Music] so paul planted there are certain things that power when he planted they are hard to be understood apollos come now not to plant but to water what does water mean everybody here let's go to act chapter 18 hallelujah act chapter 18 if you dare you can say amen verse 24. if you dare you can say amen yes sir we go downtown you there verse 24 and a certain jew name who apolos born at alexandria an eloquent man a muddy in the water he's a very good speaker and not only that the man is loaded in the scripture the man who's going to water is loaded in the scripture [Music] anybody here [Music] came to ephesus the first church of power this man was instructed in the way of the lord and being fervent zealous in the spirit he spoke and thought teaching diligently the things of the lord apollos doesn't play he's right to the letter apollos anybody here knowing only the baptism of power of john and he begin to speak broadly in the synagogue whom when aquila and priscilla had heard they took him to them and expanded in other words explained to him the way of god more water they brought him they said we see that the lord is gifting you have a gift but you're missing something you started with john but the atonement already moved come let's have fellowship so they took him to their home and sister priscilla began to cook when they sat down together they begin to talk to uh to apollos they say look you see that lamb that lamb was already killed he's already came he resurrected and descended this and apollos caught the vision everybody okay now watch apollos verse 2097 and when he was disposed to pass into akaya the brethren wrote exalting the disciple to receive him who when he was come to do what apollos came to help to help them match which had believed through the water apollos was called to come and help the people that just believe verse 28 for he murderly convinced the jews and that publicly everybody okay showing by the water that jesus was what so apollos didn't bring a new message amen apollos took what was already brought forth everybody here and use the scriptures everybody okay to nail the message is zeroed in in other words apollos take the message and he generate the message perfectly with the scripture until you don't know which way to go that is called watering everybody okay so far so paul said that i planted but apollos when he comes he doesn't bring a new message he doesn't touch the message that was already printed but apollo stick the scripture and begin to show you that what paul was saying it is written here what brother branham was saying it is written here what brother branham was saying it is written here apollos was building up he was watering power not changing power not bringing a new gospel but wondering what was already planted by paul [Music] we don't have another message to preach we don't have other sermons to preach we already have their spoken word which is the original seed our job is to order the spoken word by bringing the people through the scripture and they can see what brother branham said in the scripture everybody here but god but god gives the water so that neither is he that planted anything neither is he that does what but god that gives water all the glory goes back to god and he that planteth and he the water of our water so you must be one with your messenger repeat what the messenger say say what paul say [Music] ever here and every man shall receive his own water according to his own water the messenger will receive his and the lay and the and the clergy will receive theirs and we are labored together with god and we are god's husbandry which is the field and you are god building according to the grace of god which is given unto me let's go to ruth chapter 2 now then we nail this candlestick be the name of the lord ruth chapter 2 amen hallelujah verse 2 if you dare you can say amen and roof the moabites say to naomi let me now go to the field and clean ear of corn you understand this now after him in whose side i found water roof was looking for grace everybody okay roof was looking for grace remember the field there were many yes anybody okay the field where many divided this field belongs to who this field belonged to who and we know somehow here this is the field of boars hey back here when roof was coming under the excellent gps roof went and her hop happened to be there when roof reached the field of doors that belonged to boaz everybody here boaz was not there anybody here boys was not there roof was looking for grace everybody okay that she might be able to glean but grace the owner of the field was not there everybody okay the owner of the field left the field under the supervision because we got the category i'm going slowly we got the lord of the harvest everybody okay we got the chief reaper everybody here we got the reapers everybody okay and we got the maidens the reapers are male 1 the maidens are female 2 everybody here so the super this field of powers is left under the supervision of the chief reaper ever here so the chief reaper have a right to let you in the field everybody oh he has the right to say no everybody okay so when you come to this field you must speak to the chief reaper first ever here in other words the grace of powers everybody okay he is handed to the chief reaper even his boss is not present the chief reaper have the grace from boaz that he can open the door and let you in or close it [Music] everybody here because the chief reaper is in connection with boards but here when cases are too difficult for him he goes to the ceo but here he is a supervisor but he has a boss on top of him everybody okay when cases are too difficult he goes to the ceo and he says see you on my field i have people with problem of marriage and divorce they were married three times they were married four times they did it they didn't know what to do they were locked because they were under sin now they came and they believe you and they found out that what they did was wrong boss what should i do and they both said go tell them i forgive them they can live with their husband and wife and let them teach their children not to do it the chief reaper comes with a grace and can give you the grace and you can go free [Music] did i lose somebody paul says this paul says according to the water of god which is water so pour a plantain had the grace the planting the one who planted paul he was giving a grace [Music] do we have a grace on the harvest anybody okay proof under the candlestick ephesians 3 say apple the prisoner of fool further if ye have heard of the dispersation of water which is given to what to toward who he didn't give it to you he give to paul and paul use it towards you [Music] he give to the chief reaper are we okay how that by revelation he made known unto me the water whereby when ye read you may understand my knowledge in the water which in other ages was not made unto the son of man as it is now revealed unto his holy apostle and prophet by the spirit what is the mystery that the who should be what of the same body and partaking of this promise in christ by the water where of i paul was made uh according to the gift of what the grace of god given unto me by the effectual working of his water unto me who i am less than the least of the same is this grace given that i should preach among the gentiles the unsearchable riches of who and more about this woman in israel who should love you the lord said don't let them go amadeus get in the congregation of israel that's what the lord say but the chief reaper talked with ruth and opened the door and said go get it everybody okay so far everybody okay so far but we know that paul says that we know in part and we prophesy in water but when that which is perfect income then that which is part is what the paul that received grace and that planted only did everything in part [Music] amen okay and now a bad day faith hope charity this tree but the greatest of these things is what if you notice there's three things there we got faith brother adam said there were three disciples that jesus was taking with him do you know them when he goes to one transfiguration he took three disciples when he goes in secret place he took three he leave the other one the first one was peter branham said peter was representing faith the second one was who james james was hope and the third one was who john hope here in love who was love john hey this is hope who was talking about the works being justified by work everybody okay did you see that did you see that did i lose you james was the one that was talking about justified by works he was in the holy place peter your faith started in another court and john the lord which is in the holy place did i lose you [Music] peter either coat james in the holy place because you justified by works and then love you get into the holiest the tabernacle all over the scripture everybody here everybody here but the greatest one is water because you want to go to the holidays amen john which is the top of the bread in the holiest and right here for i am jealous of you with a godly jealousy policy for i have married you to one husband i have married you to one husband that i may present you at chester paul say i have his spouse you paul even though he planted he had a grace his grace could only espouse you bring you as a fiancee but no marriage you need a marriage somewhere somebody need to hook you with boaz you need somebody to hook you with boaz [Music] hallelujah everybody here not paul peter says this in the bible he said gird where the lungs of your man be sober you know this now and hope to the end for the water that is to be brought unto you at the water the revelation of jesus christ happened in the end time in the time of harvest there is another grace there remember the two fives in the tabernacle anybody here the enemy that saw with them is the devil anybody care their harvest is what everybody okay the harvest means water so the harvest doesn't belong to paul it belongs to somebody else here the harvest is the end of the world and the reapers are the water everybody okay there the reapers are angels there is two kind of angel they are angelic being's angel and they are human angels everybody which are the messenger or the preachers everybody okay anybody okay and he said i shall command the young men now as you go along the reapers the water you see the scripture right he said every once in a while let her glean wherever she want to and then drop a little handful on purpose let's go to roof 2 now and let's drop to milk let's drop to milk everybody okay my god oh my god you ready all right let's get it luke chapter two she found grace she was looking for grace jump to verse five then say boaz to his servant that was set over the reapers the supervisor the chief reaper boaz came and talked to him boaz never came and talked to roof [Music] anybody here he came first to the chief reaper you shall be judged first you remember last sunday to the chief reaper and he asked for the report he says whose demsel is this so the one who can give the detail is somebody else the chief reaper who's responsible for whatever is in it roof under in other words before boaz came roof was under the supervision of the chief reaper here the chief reaper have his light of the roof in other words roof was under the wing of the chief reaper [Music] here ever here the chief reaper represented boaz but he was not bowers he was only a reflection of boaz [Music] everybody okay when boss is absent that's when he's charming because the candlesticks are used when there is darkness brother branham said can the stick speak of the abscess of the sun and you need the light when the sun is not there because boys represented christ but when christ is not there you must be in the field that is they have the representative of bowers you cannot go to any kind of field let me help you up again according to the law according to god according to the law according to the word of god every field in israel can give food to anybody anybody here if i go to brother kalima's field if he's working i can get food if i go to brother greg for the field i can get food if i go to brother hamilton field i can get through every field that is in israel can give you food all of them are jewish field anybody here but every field cannot give you marriage are you with me every field can give you the natural food that you need everybody but not every field can give you marriage because jesus taught the woman everywhere you can drink of this water tomorrow you'll be thirsty again but there is another world another heaven if i give you that water you will never come to this anymore ever here so when you go to the field of israel roof could have been gone here and get something for food and go back home he can go here and get some kind of food and go back home but all this field even though they are jewish filled [Music] even though they are christians filled [Music] they can provide you some kind of food [Music] the pentecostal can preach the bible the baptist can preach the bible the presbyterian can preach the bible but they are not the qualified field for you the denomination can give you the bible because the bible is universal but you must be in the field that can give you not only baba that can give you more than bubble a field that can bring you into relationship into marriage and that field must have a chief repair [Music] it is a field that is connected by bloodline [Music] you must see your family blood in that field that's the field that you go through because they are the field you can eat all you want and you will remain in that situation it's just soothing you and tomorrow you hungry tomorrow you hungry but your condition doesn't change you go there we know you come there a widow you go there a widow you come there a widow but there is only one field if you enter there he can lock you and change you from a widow woman into a married woman because nobody in israel can marry you only the line of judah and not everybody in the land of judah it must be the wrong line of judah [Music] everybody okay so far so this field is important where you landed when you land there boaz is not there you find the chief reaper the chief reaper is giving report let's go my friend we good on time when you drive like this it's like you in eternity some of you are like ah it looks like two hours it's eternity when you come out there oh we finish your time because you drop back in time anybody here verse five whose stem cell is this and the servant that was set over the water do you see the chief ripper he's on top of everybody every single reaper is under the ripper [Music] you remember every single reaper in the field gabor and the chief written under you listen to what the chief reaper say you repeat what the chief reaper said because the chief reaper doesn't speak his mind he's getting the program from boards he's accomplishing the agenda of bowers follow me as a follower everybody here verse six and the servant that was set up for the the reapers answered and say it is the more british damsel how did he know that how did he know that who taught him that he knows the family of uh of boaz he knows the lineage he understands he can connect to lima like was a brother to boaz and he knows everything everybody here the damsel that came back with naomi out of the country of moab and she said now the chief reaper began to speak to boaz what happened before boaz got there she said i pray you you remember that let me glean and gather after the reapers among the chief so roof could not go and start gleaning she have to ask and somebody in the absence of boaz have to grant that grace that roof was looking because it was grace to reap somebody gotta give her the grace even though boaz is not there i don't know what is wrong with the screen okay the devil okay all right and then the reapers among the chief so she came and has continued even from the morning until now that she terry in a leader in the water how can a stranger come and you let her go in the house to to rest who put who taught her to go rest in the house why did the chief reaper tell tell ruth go rest over there it looks like the chief reaper knew the mind of boaz [Music] and the chief reaper understood that if i put that woman over there he's not going to get mad because it's part of his family [Music] ruth doesn't understand the chief reaper come and say you tired go ahead over there go rest me me yeah go over there do you see the couch over there yes god rest over there oh he's such a good man he's so sweet thank you the chief ripper has just said he said she doesn't understand anything wait till my boss come on everybody here so she worked from the morning until that time she gathered the general food anybody here roof have three foods you okay now the first food the roof got is the general food by the law everybody can get this anybody here when boys came let's see again verse 8 then say bars to roof hear you not my daughter go not to glean in another water be careful you're not here by any chance everybody here don't move from here [Music] because the christian because the christian there is a mystery why you came in here there is a mystery why some other people are there and you are here don't move from here because this field is the only one that can bring you in israel nobody else so don't move from here stay where you are anybody care not to glean in another field even though it's a jewish field do not go anybody here neither go from here but about here fast by water roof when power's meet roof roof was under the supervision of the chief reaper everybody here and roof was gleaming after the reapers everybody here but when powers came boaz told the roof don't go after the reaper anymore everybody okay now you need to go after the water the maiden demands are women and a woman in the bible represent what the church in other words don't be going from preacher to preacher anymore you must find a local church somewhere get more stable now that's why when brother branham was preaching and the people get converted brother branham was sending them to local churches anybody here but make sure your local church have a reaper that is under the chief reaper make sure the maiden that you follow the church that you go with have a repair but that reaper must have his instruction from the chief repair and the chief reaper have his instruction from boaz roof under the candlestick am i trying to say about here [Music] let's go down uh job to verse 15 hallelujah are you there and when she was raising up to glean boaz commended his young men everybody here saying let her gleam even among the water and reproach her knot everybody here verse 16 and let fall also some of the handful of water for her and leave them that she may glean them and rebuke her not the first food was a general food anybody care when they were gleaming the field and something dropped ever here everybody can get that and then the remaining they put it in shift and they take it once it's in the shift of the reaper roof have no right to that food anybody okay now when birds came boaz opened the second food to root the second food of fruit was a food given on purpose or an intention of food everybody okay everybody okay the food that she was once restricted before now she can have access everybody okay but she's not the one going to get it everybody care the reapers get it come on here and drop it for her the reapers are the angels the reapers are the preachers but here they can get certain food and they will drop it intentionally do you follow me do you follow me you're working on the job let me help you you're working on the job and they will make a a party on your job and they bring cupcakes and everything there when you come all the employees come when you eat the cupcake are you afraid of the cupcake are you do you have suspicion of the cupcake do you know why because they told you that the cupcake belongs to everybody at work and the supervisor boarded and everybody in the company will eat right you can even get one two three four some of you will even take some home do you leave it let me take some home because they belong to everybody [Music] everybody okay everybody okay now you go home you have your session at work everybody okay you come tomorrow and you find two cupcakes that are dropping your station are you going to eat it why you don't want to eat it and then one of your co-workers passed he said hey how you doing i dropped those two cupcakes for you anybody okay are you going to eat it ever here if you're a woman are you going to eat it what comes in your mind can you tell me i'm asking the sister what will begin to come in your mind why is he giving me what because now it's not the general cake you ate yesterday it becomes an intentional cupcake ever here in other words this cupcake has a language it is not really cupcake it is saying something everybody okay he didn't say anything but he's talking with a cupcake everybody okay so when the wolf begins to go she remember she knows how she claimed but she came back and she found she's cleaning and boom they said take it take it take it it's okay you say is it okay okay thank you thank you sir that was nice she goes and somebody else drop it [Music] at the beginning are you okay are you okay let me drop the third food so you get it the third food of roof then i'm gonna come back to the intention is this in roof three the bible says that also he said bring the veil that that has upon thee when ruth met with boaz without anybody and hold it and when she held that he measured how many measures of water disturbed the roof this was under the reaper ever here this under the reapers everybody here behind the maiden everybody here but this one is six measures of barley directly from boas nobody in between no repairs no maiden directly straight from boast sixth measure why six six is the number of men everybody okay and oh and when she came to her mother-in-law she said who are they my daughter in other words how did things go america and she told her oh that the man has what done to her did boast do anything you who know the scripture nothing but he just gave her six measures of valley and she said this sixth measure of valley gave him me for he said to me go not empty unto that mother in love so ruth is still blind what what happened what did it happen oh i went there i was scared i was scared mama mama was scared what happened i went there i slept i was trembling i'm telling you when he woke up my heart was up i didn't know what to do and then when he began to i could not talk and then what else and then he gave me this sixth measure of valley he's so kind so now we have food we can eat are you okay when naomi look she saw sixth measure of bali roof so six measurable but a mama understood [Music] everybody here you say you little girl you think he gave you six measure of bali this is what it means everybody okay and she said these six men general bali gave him me for he said to me go not empty unto the mother-in-law it looks like boaz was caring for his mother-in-law get this and say hello to your mama and give it to mama mama need candy everybody okay everybody okay naomi give the interpretation then she said sit still my daughter young girl put your car in neutral that's it what listen to mama put your car in neutral sit still my daughter until then know how the mother will what for the man would not be in water until he had done whatever when naomi saw the sixth measure of ballet he says this your trouble is over you don't have any more trouble it is time for you to rest the trouble has been transferred from you to him he's the one who's not gonna sleep you are not sleeping before now it's your time to sleep he's the one that won't sleep he's not gonna rest until he finished finish what [Music] the work of redemption [Music] [Applause] everybody okay let me see where to get hallelujah hallelujah so we got the first food general the second purpose intentional the third one is boaz himself giving the food what is the first food brother stephen and while she was gleaning in the field directed by the holy spirit to go into that field to glean you see why brother branham says this then come up boaz up kemboas boaz was a representative of who and for he was the lord of the harvest he was over the harvest and notice as soon as he looked out in the field and saw that gentle girl he did water now the prophet begin to open it but here why she was gleaming behind the what this general food everybody okay that is what the church has to do pick up a little bit here and a little bit there cleaning reading over there and seeing what who and what the and how the way of redemption was what picking up this little cleaning behind the jewish water there see what i mean that grain that she that they were ripping represented what what eternal life to us out of the water the word of water men shall not live by bread alone but by every water so the general food that roof was getting behind the reapers remember roof came from the other court young in the faith about here and suddenly she began to read her bible more amen amen after you gave your heart to the lord after you gave your you went to the world of baptism did you notice that after a while you begin to read the bible more do you know who was reading the bible brother branham said she began to look at job you begin to read the barber mold but still that's a general food you don't understand the bible quite late because you're younger in the faith everybody okay brother brother says this hallelujah brother branham says this he says so what was she gleaning for she was gleaming for food and that's what the gentile church did coming behind the orthodox church picking up all the head which was the water gleaming what god give to the water so when you are coming out from the article from under justification when you start entering into sanctification the first sign you would notice you begin to get in tune with reading the bible if it didn't happen to you go check it again but here you will read the bible without understanding what you're reading you just read it looks like something in you love the bible story love the bible story you don't know what is going on because you just move into another stage but here once you get in that stage then the food change here from a general reading of the baba into a food that is given on purpose or intentionally and that food comes from the reapers the reaper pull it from the ship you didn't have access to that the reaper have access to that because the reapers are angels the reaper are messenger the reaper are gifted people everybody here by their gift they can enter in the world anybody here and they can get a revelation here and they can pull that out and when you come to church all discouraged going through a lot of headache in life you will see him opening something in the scripture and before you know it you forget the problem that you came with suddenly you became joyful like wow oh my god you turn around here it is your husband begin to drop certain things but you must be careful to understand it is not just food he's telling you he loves you he already begin to fall in love with you he begin to express it by sending cupcakes [Music] ever here tomorrow you come to work he put a flower there now you become more uncomfortable because you know what he's trying to say when you see him hey good morning good morning and then he said did you see what i gave it to you you know now what he means the more he job the more the job the more the job the more the job the unfolding stuff that you could not see in the world when you are reading the scripture before now when you go to church the reapers drop when you go to church they reap her job when you go to church the reaper it is a language from boaz that purposely i am sending you this i am giving you this i am jumping and tomorrow something job oh my god i've never seen it like this and before you know it before you know it the working of the field is no more painful but here it is no more work it becomes a pleasure when it's time to go to the field when everybody else is suffering you are even enjoy quickly and need to get ready get in the car ready because there are some more handfuls that are coming up ever here why somebody is sending you his goodness because the behind that goodness behind the food that he's giving behind the revelation he's unfolding every day he has a message the message is i'm already in love with you everybody here everybody here brother brother says this but if adam said he says to the reaper you see that young lady that is right behind you let her breathe let the cleaning be heavy and then said every once in a while drop a handful on what it is not those purpose handful if you go to another field you won't see them you only have to remain in the field of boaz it is sermon that you're not going to find somewhere else here i love those handful amen gleaning behind the ripple drop a handful on purpose that she could get oh how rule felt when she grabbed a whole handful the reaper turn around and say it's all right it's all right and when god give us an old-fashioned water pouring off water sometimes you come to church and they start singing and then you feel like the anointing is coming it is boaz it is powers it is boaz everybody here hallelujah brother vladam continue he said now she's claiming for life i want you reapers you angels in other words that is what they are i want you angel you reapers every once in a while to drop a handful on purpose oh don't let be all so tiresome for her boaz didn't remove the work he left the work but he make the work light back here so you're not really doing the work you become a collector at the beginning you are looking like this now you can even rest boom boom you become just a collector it is not you doing the work and back here you're working out your salvation but you're not the one really working it is the reaper that are sweating to make sure the boss is saying the boss say i cannot go to sleep the boss say the boss say [Music] your working is no more work it is no more strain it is not more something painful it is a joyful work you are working under the love [Music] hallelujah because he also taught the reaper not to touch you [Music] why not touch that woman because jealousy begin to come i don't like the boys to look at her don't touch it in other words the boss already claimed ever here the boss became jealous everybody here once in a while don't let that be tiresome she's already tired on wednesday she's coming and suddenly a handful dropped ever here when she's going home she doesn't want to go home anymore she stand outside and she begin to fellowship every care why because once in a while let her hear a good word let the good power of the holy ghost come for her once in a while and let her know that i'm still what do some kind of healing among her some kind of sun some kind of wonder that she shall know that it is i am water i'm gonna do certain sun she got sick i heal her when she come back with a testimony it is boaz i was praying for a job the lord gave me the job it is powers he begin to show the goodness he begin to drop the blessing left and right you don't want to miss church anymore [Music] ever here let me zero into the airport it is the purpose of what he's doing amen yeah gotta stop anybody here roof under the candlestick let me drop the candlestick then we stop here oh my god hallelujah in revelation 1 the bible said the mystery of the seventh star which that sourced in my right hand everybody here and the seven golden candlesticks are what everybody here the seven candlestick which does sowest are the seven churches so when you look at the candlestick and i'm gonna close here when you look at the candlestick the candlestick are seven light in one anybody here we are here there are seven light in one anybody here brother bottom say the way this light was lit was there was a fire that came from the feeling of fire anybody here so we got a pillar of fire here and the leak of fire dropped and came and got there then detect this light and delete the second then delete the turn then delete the fourth then the fifth the fifth this is all these little fires are pillars of fire everybody here they just fragment of pillar of fire from the big pillar of fire anybody okay and in revelation 4 the bible says out of the throne proceeded lightning and thundering and voices we went through this and there were seven lamps of water burning before the water which are the seven water in heaven you have a throne and before the throne you found seven lamps remember moses did what he saw there ever here and those seven lamps were the seven water spirit of god because these seven came from here make sense now let's finish and before the throne there was the sea of glass like unto christ we went through this in heaven there was a sea of glass here so in heaven on the throne was the pillar of fire god and god radiate his light bulk here and the light from the candle stick hit the sea of gas ever here this is the light from god through the candlestick through the sea of glass anybody okay that was in heaven i'm gonna go to the airport brother bottom says that the seven lamps were the seven manifestation of the holy spirit of the seven church ages at the seventh seat of mercy for the people seven seats of mercy seven seats seven church edges seven star seven manifestation let me hurry up and then i'm gonna get it what is going on brother adam said that's we know that the seven spirit of god means that it is one spirit and the same spirit coming forth in what anybody okay but what i'm saying in revelation 4 in heaven it is the same spirit the same seven spirit are called the lamps of fire burning before the lord since john always used nothing but the old testament symbols in the revelation we got to go in the old testament and found from proverbs 20 27 the spirit of a man is what a lamp unto the lord so these seven spirits are found to be associated with what so the seven spirits that are here are connected to human being anybody here all right now brother branham say i have to skip this one because of time you can read it at home come on brother branham say it is evident that the servant spirit of god referred to the continuous ministry of the same holy spirit in the lives of seven men with whom god identified himself very a chief reaper closely anybody here they are his eyes they are his what who these men are can easily be seen because the next phrase called them the seven what which are already known to us as the seventh messenger to the seven water so these seven spirits are the seven anointing that came upon the messenger of the edges in heaven the star war before the throne reflecting on the sea of glass but in the tabernacle it is different this is where i'm going to drop and go anybody okay brother bonham say in every age we have exactly the same pattern that is why the light comes through some god-given man in a certain area the chief reaper and then from that messenger the chief reaper they spread the light through the ministry of others the reapers who has been fed fully what apollos anybody okay his messenger returned back the messenger of joshua despised i have obeyed your orders and there was a woman we found we played the tape to you brother brother said that when the spies went into jericho they enter into herald they played the tips in the time of jericho did they have tips push play did they have tips who was the tips the spies the tape made flesh [Music] a tape doesn't manufacture the message a tape doesn't change the message a tape only repeats what has been recorded into him they repeat it what they received from joshua [Music] hallelujah in exodus 26 the bible says that that shall hang up the veil this one under the touches and that the mayor's bringing tether within the veil the ark of the testimony we are here and the veil shall divide unto you between the water and the water it is this veil right here ever here and that shall put the mercy seat upon the ark of the testimony in the most water we are here everybody and that shall set the table without the in other words outside this bear in the holy place that's where you put the table where was the table and the candle stick over against the water so in the tabernacle the candlestick were opposite to the table anybody okay so when they lit the candlestick the candlestick were given light and the light of the candlestick was charming on the table what was on the table everybody okay and over against the table on the side of the tabernacle towards the water and that shall put the table on the water so on the north side because this is the east gate this is the west the north is here the surf is here so on the north where the eagle dan is this is where the showbread was put there and over against that were the candlestick and the candlestick have the light from the pillar of fire and that light was shining on the bread ever here so when you enter in the holy place you must find the field that have the candlestick and those candlesticks must shine on the world and the light from the candlestick is shining on the world the light from the messenger goes through the bible and when he pick up the bible he opened the bible to you this is where you need to stay this is where you need to eat this is why you need to serve this is where you need to abide this is your plan of redemption that's where you stand in the field of prowess under the messenger of the hour under the reapers under the churches that are under the message of the hour let's stand you don't glean anywhere before you gleam you must know which field you're gleaning because the favor of boaz is only on that field you go to that field and make sure there is a reaper and stay under the reaper and the reaper must stay under the chief reaper if the reaper is not under the chief reaper you are on the wrong reaper you need to come out right here because at the absence of boaz you must be under the candlestick the candlestick must give you light everybody here because the candlestick are going to shine on the showbread and then when they shine on the showbread the light from the candlestick hit the show bread and then the showbread now is a different bread and we will see they call that show bread why is this show bread do you know what showbread means it means the bread of his presence when that bread is there he is there back here and nobody eats those bread except the priest or you must be in the lineage of david following david and david can get that bread [Music] and nothing happened to you only the priest can get it and those bread were sean from the candlestick roof serving you don't serve any kind of way you don't serve in any kind of field you don't serve with any kind of food you must serve under the field of boaz under the messenger and if there is a preacher that preacher must follow the messenger to keep the program of boaz for your life because the one who's giving instruction is boaz and all we do is delivering whatever boaz is saying and what he's delivering is only an expression of love and that he's preparing you because he's going to take you to somewhere and when he take you that place you're going to receive the third food and the third food nobody gave it to you it only boasts do you know that food can i tell you do you know in revelation 10 when the marriage came down everybody he had what he had a book and 10 7 who was there the messenger the chief reaper everybody here the chief reaper sundered the trumpet but the chief reaper didn't give you the book everybody here they told john now you go yourself you go to boaz that book only boasts you take it from boaz [Music] the chief reaper can send it but boaz is the one that gave it to you back here the chief reaper didn't take it and gave it to john they said no the voice told john you go go tell the angel the angel said i'm not gonna give it to you [Music] when john put his hand there there was no chief reaper there was no reaper it was the hand of john and the hand of boaz [Music] that's a different food about here that's a different food once you swallow that you can prophesy let's pray heavenly father lord we thank you again father for your grace for your love your mercy and for everything you have been doing for us father many subject has been touched due to the depth of this book lord there are many ways we can go because the scripture is so loaded but father the main thing is you want your children to understand that to serve you we don't serve you any kind of way we don't serve you in any kind of field there is a program a plan of redemption when we enter that stage we must make sure that the bread we are eating is a bread that have a light that is reflecting from the candlestick of the age because that's the bread that's going to prepare us father to enter into the most holy father like you spoke weeks ago that the water the message of noah could not work in moses time the message of moses could not work in the time of jesus and the message of jesus could not work in the time of moses because there is a specific water there is a specific field there is a specific candlestick there is a specific bread there is a specific wheat that must be given to a people and that's the wheat that's going to clean up your bread under sanctification and remove everything else that is not like you for the denomination we can glean something here and there but that which is giving under the nomination is not able to take the pants off of the woman it's not able to take the high heel of the woman it's not able to take the short hair from the women it's not able to change people it's only covering the people and keeping them in the very state that they came in but father there is a word that can wash there is a word a bread that can wash that the one who's partaking to this bread even though it's painful through the candlestick because there is a beating that is going on there but father that word not only is it washing but it's chipping everything that is not like you away because you could not associate with roof that quick you have to go further through the pen and the toes that she's working father sweating under the sun but you keep showing your goodness father encouraging her that know that i love you i am still with you i'm watching over you i am the one protecting you i am the one encouraging you it's a little bit harder but keep cleaning keep cleaning all i want is a character from you i want everything that is not like me to be completely stripped away i want everything that you came with from moab to be completely taken off and when all is taken off then i can receive you as my brother and i can put my seals of circumcision father we thank you for everything and we are committing this church unto the hand and the sacrifice they're doing to go extra my lord so that we can deliver the message father may you protect them and continue to minister to them throughout the week lord and continue to unfold your word more and more more than what we can say and what we skip lord and what we left lord you more than able to explain your children lord and to give them a revelation so that they can understand that this is not a legalistic standpoint but it is a work of love it is not that we taking the the uh paint off because we are on the obligation but we're taking the paint off because we're trying to find grace we're trying to please the lord we're trying to do things that is going to make him happy because we can see his goodness of the lord all my life i can testify the goodness of the lord i can see the goodness of the lord all over from the chad all the way from my childhood all the way now we see many things happening but once in a while we can see door opening here door opening there somebody's getting healed somebody doing this you healing my mother you're healing my brother you're healing this you're doing this and this and our heart continue to rejoice even though things in the world get painful but father we thank you for that goodness and the handful that you're bringing to this church and drop that day by day as we continue to approach until we meet you into the air father we committed and ask it in the name of jesus christ amen god bless you church we love you brother [Music] such a beautiful life come where [Music] by [Music] y'all are dismissed as we sing this once again this morning [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] shine all around us [Music] the light of the world [Music]
