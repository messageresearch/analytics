[20:50] foreign
[20:52] well let's pray
[20:54] Heavenly Father we're very grateful Lord
[20:56] Jesus for this fresh man
[20:59] Lord God that you're opening up to us
[21:01] Lord Jesus it's it's the manner to
[21:03] strengthen us for the hour that we live
[21:05] in power
[21:06] Lord we just pray Lord God that you give
[21:08] us ears to be attentive
[21:10] to have an understanding of what you're
[21:13] saying Lord God
[21:15] Lord Jesus I believe that if we just
[21:18] keep eating Lord God
[21:19] if we don't get discouraged if we don't
[21:21] stay away
[21:23] we must be determined Lord God to be in
[21:26] those Church doors every time that
[21:27] they're open father and to come and
[21:31] build an atmosphere Lord so that the
[21:32] minister can Minister Lord because truly
[21:35] the gift works on the hunger of The
[21:37] Souls of the people father
[21:39] I've listened to a Minister preach the
[21:41] same sermon three times father and it's
[21:44] always different Lord God and if you
[21:46] notice it's the congregation that makes
[21:48] the difference
[21:49] if they come hungry if they come thirsty
[21:51] if they come with a painful desire not
[21:55] just just a casual appetite but a
[21:58] painful desire and we're hunger and
[22:00] we're thirsting Lord for righteousness
[22:03] Lord because without peace and Holiness
[22:05] no man shall see God no man can
[22:08] understand your father and so Lord
[22:10] tonight father take our hunger pangs and
[22:13] fill them Lord God with your Holiness
[22:15] Lord fill them with the word Lord to
[22:18] strengthen us with the might in the
[22:19] might of our spirit that we might please
[22:21] you in everything that we think say and
[22:23] do Lord because we know it's the hearing
[22:26] of the word that gives us Faith Lord and
[22:28] by faith we're able to please you and
[22:31] now Lord with that faith that was built
[22:33] up in this assembly tonight
[22:35] every one of our hearts bound knit
[22:38] together knit together as Paul said Lord
[22:41] God compacted together he said it in
[22:43] another place Lord we want to bring our
[22:45] sister yoga bed before you Lord we don't
[22:49] know what is going on but one thing we
[22:51] do know is that you're greater than the
[22:53] problem Lord Jesus before there was ever
[22:56] a sickness there was a Healer before
[22:58] there was a sinner there was a savior
[23:00] you had it predestinated before the
[23:03] foundation of the world and now we pray
[23:05] Lord God that that anointing faith will
[23:07] drop down into our heart right now Lord
[23:09] and father that you'll lift her up from
[23:11] that bed of Affliction Lord and that'll
[23:13] be a testimony to all those Lord God
[23:16] that are at present in the room father

[56:39] praise be to God yes
[56:42] but we are right in the middle of the
[56:44] road
[56:47] let's turn to our scripture
[56:50] Romans chapter 9 verse 33.
[56:58] my wife came with me she's in the
[57:01] nursery room with a baby so you won't be
[57:04] able to see it out here but he certainly
[57:06] loves the world and she loves this
[57:08] church so much
[57:14] Romans chapter 9 verse 33 if you have it
[57:17] it reads like this
[57:19] says it is written behold I lay in Zion
[57:24] a stumbling Stone
[57:26] and a rock of offense
[57:29] and whosoever believeth on him shall not
[57:31] be ashamed amen amen
[57:34] behold I yes my brother as a personal
[57:38] pronoun
[57:39] lay inside The Stumbling Stone
[57:43] it's not anyone who is doing this is God
[57:46] himself who is laying in Zion a rock of
[57:50] offense
[57:51] praise be to God
[57:54] blessed is he that is not offended in me
[57:58] praise be to God
[58:00] you may have your seats
[58:03] pray once more
[58:05] Lord we thank you for the inspiration
[58:07] that wrote the Bible we believe the
[58:09] inspiration is still alive tonight come

[58:15] amen may you break the bread in such a
[58:17] way that they will recognize you like

[58:22] in Jesus Christ's name amen amen praise

[58:28] with uh the parallel in the seventh
[58:32] trumpet and the seventh the seal yes
[58:34] uh we just started on it but I feel like
[58:37] we didn't do enough Justice to it
[58:41] so today I will try to give more context
[58:44] and more quotation so that you know what
[58:47] we are talking about amen so as we begin
[58:49] here you'll see that it's God who said
[58:52] here so this is Paul talking about the
[58:55] Jews
[58:56] so Romans 9 10 11 Paul is talking about
[59:00] the Jews
[59:01] that the Jews they stumbled Over The
[59:03] Stumbling Stone
[59:05] but this stumbling Stone it was God who
[59:07] put that stumbling Stone
[59:09] you know when brother Branham was in his
[59:11] home he had a vision
[59:13] and in that Vision he had a blast
[59:16] praise be to God and when he had a blast
[59:19] it was so powerful that it almost shook
[59:22] the Earth
[59:24] and he said I thought I was going to die
[59:27] but Joseph was in that dream I said Lord
[59:30] if I'm not going to die send back your
[59:33] power and God sent back his power
[59:37] praise Bill God now I'm not going to go
[59:40] into the details of the vision but he
[59:42] says when I came out of the vision
[59:45] I was pointing to this scripture behold
[59:48] I lay a stone in Zion
[59:50] so this scripture was being written by
[59:53] Paul concerning the Jews but what
[59:56] happens to the Jews is exactly what
[59:58] happens to the Gentiles that's right
[1:00:00] that God brings estambling Stone yes God
[1:00:04] brings a rock of offense yes God is
[1:00:07] about to do something that will be an
[1:00:09] offense to some people that's right
[1:00:11] Hallelujah yes my brother and brother

[1:00:16] message says is this the time that's

[1:00:20] was talking the vision that would be
[1:00:22] fulfilled in in Arizona yes sir and

[1:14:48] plane that can do that only a rocket can
[1:14:51] do that and the only reason why a rocket
[1:14:54] can do that is because the pilot has no
[1:14:56] control so if you want to go hypersonic
[1:15:00] give up the control yes my brother
[1:15:06] yes sir

[1:23:05] archangel
[1:23:07] now the Bible here is saying that the
[1:23:09] Lord himself
[1:23:12] it's a personal pronoun
[1:23:15] preacher it's not a man doing this but
[1:23:19] it's the Lord himself yes my brother he
[1:23:22] shall descend from heaven yes sir with a
[1:23:26] shout yes with the voice of an archangel
[1:23:29] yes and with the Trump of God and the

[1:23:49] brother in a moment in the twinkle of an
[1:23:51] eye you shall be changed
[1:23:56] Genesis 18 verse 10. and he said I will
[1:24:01] certainly return unto thee
[1:24:03] according to the time
[1:24:06] Hallelujah so God is using that personal
[1:24:10] pronoun I
[1:24:12] I will return unto Thief yes sir
[1:24:16] and he performs not a gift
[1:24:20] at the side the sign of the massage
[1:24:22] that's right why did Sarah laugh behind
[1:24:27] no man ever did that
[1:24:30] that's a masonic sign yes my brother
[1:24:33] it's not the among the non-spiritual
[1:24:36] gifts
[1:24:37] it's not among the five fault that's a
[1:24:41] Messianic sign yes my brother
[1:24:45] I will be certainly return and to think
[1:24:51] oh God called Abraham Guinness is 12.
[1:24:54] and then he confirms his confidence is
[1:24:56] 15 and then he comes together 15 17 and
[1:24:59] then he changes his name says you shall
[1:25:02] not more be called Abraham aha but he
[1:25:05] shall be called Abraham yes sir and God
[1:25:07] hated the letter H
[1:25:10] now the letter H is the fifth letter of
[1:25:12] the Hebrew alphabet and five is the
[1:25:15] number of Grace
[1:25:17] now when you say the letter s in Hebrew
[1:25:20] you split the tongue
[1:25:22] each life
[1:25:24] God breathed life into our men and he
[1:25:28] became Abraham and he breathed again
[1:25:30] into Sarah and she became Sarah
[1:25:34] Hallelujah because when Adam was created
[1:25:38] though he was in the image of God but
[1:25:40] God had to breathe the breath of it of
[1:25:43] life amen to Adam yes sir Adam became a
[1:25:47] living Soul that's right
[1:25:49] Hallelujah yes my brother
[1:25:52] and before Elijah came
[1:25:55] the name had six letters
[1:25:58] in there to change it right God showing
[1:26:01] that he's going to breathe life amen
[1:26:04] hallelujah to confirm it to the seat of
[1:26:07] Ibraham yes sir because the letter H is
[1:26:10] speaking of life amen how many knows
[1:26:13] about jester
[1:26:15] I love jephthah he was an outskirt out
[1:26:18] Outcast that's right they say well he
[1:26:21] says his mother was a harlot so we are
[1:26:24] not going to give him ill inheritance
[1:26:26] and the Bible says that he was from
[1:26:29] Gilead
[1:26:31] Elijah
[1:26:38] [Music]
[1:26:40] they teach bite from us from the
[1:26:42] inhabitants of gilia right because
[1:26:44] remember bomb comes from Gilead right so
[1:26:46] Jester he goes to fight the men of
[1:26:49] Ephraim writer because they had backslit
[1:26:52] that's what these were men that were
[1:26:54] blotted from under Heaven remember
[1:26:57] Ephraim was brought it from under Heaven
[1:26:59] that's exactly right if you think that
[1:27:01] scriptures don't repeat themselves you
[1:27:04] are deceiving yourself
[1:27:12] men who were baptized in the name of
[1:27:15] Jesus
[1:27:16] leaving the message of the hour

[1:29:10] shout himself from Heaven yes sir with a
[1:29:13] shout
[1:29:16] thank you
[1:29:17] and Abraham was a pilgrim
[1:29:20] and he did not have any property
[1:29:22] the only thing that Abraham bought from
[1:29:25] Ephraim the hittite Ephron he said I'm a
[1:29:28] pilgrim right
[1:29:29] right sell me this field that's right
[1:29:32] and that field was called macpella right

[1:33:41] voice of the Resurrection that's a loud
[1:33:44] voice in John 11 38 that God Lazarus
[1:33:47] from the grave amen amen and now the
[1:33:50] third thing is a trumpet preacher which
[1:33:53] Always A Feast of trumpets is calling
[1:33:55] people to the fish tank that's right
[1:33:57] that would be the bride's lamp supper
[1:34:00] pray to my brother Hallelujah
[1:34:04] the actor Gospels
[1:34:06] they are leading you to a Lamborghini
[1:34:08] they're leading you to a new house but
[1:34:10] there is one trumpet which is calling
[1:34:13] you to the marriage supper of the Lamb
[1:34:15] that's the trumpet of Elijah yes my
[1:34:17] brother that's the voice of Elijah

[1:34:35] the message tell me about Jesus bosses
[1:34:38] with Jesus preacher there are many Jesus

[1:34:42] but which Jesus
[1:34:45] Hallelujah yes the sons of Stephen said
[1:34:48] which Jesus are you talking about
[1:34:52] If any man comes and preach

[1:35:03] [Music]
[1:35:05] they could not find fault in the prophet
[1:35:07] and the woman says I have one fault with
[1:35:09] you
[1:35:10] you break too much on Jesus ah man I'm
[1:35:14] going to prove to you that he was not
[1:35:16] divine
[1:35:17] and the prophet says
[1:35:20] preacher to the amusement of the
[1:35:23] mathematicians
[1:35:25] you can put this together it's a
[1:35:27] spiritual Revelation since Jesus was 100
[1:35:30] God 100 man now you put that together

[1:35:39] foreign
[1:35:42] spoke so much about Jesus amen

[1:36:21] and in the evening service he says
[1:36:24] brother Wade fell down and tied in the
[1:36:26] surface
[1:36:28] I believe maybe it's because I preached
[1:36:30] for too long or else my brother was
[1:36:32] having a complex and you know what your
[1:36:35] book you go back to the book of Acts
[1:36:37] Paul preached about Jesus the whole
[1:36:40] night until ticket has fell down from
[1:36:43] the balcony
[1:36:45] talking about Jesus that's right
[1:36:47] Hallelujah preacher he was not talking
[1:36:49] about himself he was talking about Jesus
[1:36:53] that's exactly right
[1:36:55] [Applause]
[1:36:56] there is no man that we know in in
[1:36:59] recent history
[1:37:00] that that spoke about Jesus the same way
[1:37:03] that the prophet spoke about Jesus you
[1:37:07] cannot separate the message from Jesus

[1:37:12] because the message introduces Christ
[1:37:16] amen
[1:37:21] preach my brother he was like poor poor

[1:39:41] sorrows and I am come down to deliver
[1:39:43] them out of the hand of the Egyptians
[1:39:46] now this operation was called Jacob's
[1:39:49] trouble

[1:39:53] trumpet where Christ comes to reveal
[1:39:56] himself to the Jews amen now when he
