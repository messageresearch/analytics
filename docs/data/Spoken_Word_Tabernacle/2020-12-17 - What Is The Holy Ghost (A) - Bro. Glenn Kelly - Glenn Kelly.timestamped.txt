[31:43] his children we thank the lord for
[31:45] giving us grace to be able to go
[31:48] in this area is nothing new it's
[31:50] something that the
[31:51] prophet had worked with but i kept
[31:53] hearing it in my spirit
[31:55] i believe it's time i said lord i want
[31:56] to be obedient unto you
[31:58] i thank you for a pastor to being
[32:01] obedient and
[32:02] he knows that i tried to give it away

[32:06] spot away tonight
[32:07] so the lot has failed here tonight so
[32:10] we're looking for great things from him
[32:12] is that right so we want you to go to
[32:14] math you
[32:15] all you have matthew 5 and verse 6
[32:18] you have to say amen he says blessed are
[32:21] they
[32:22] which do hunger and thirst after
[32:24] righteousness for they shall be filled
[32:26] you may be seated you know what i've
[32:28] been i
[32:29] kept hearing in my spirit about people
[32:32] who
[32:33] uh uh need more of the holy ghost people
[32:36] needing the holy ghost people need
[32:38] understanding of the holy ghost
[32:40] you know we're going in a different
[32:42] angle area tonight so we need your
[32:44] prayers
[32:45] because i know it may be simple to some
[32:47] of y'all that have the holy ghost
[32:49] but you pray with me for the ones that
[32:51] don't have the holy ghost
[32:52] and for the ones that need a refilling
[32:54] is that right i don't get an opportunity
[32:57] you know since i don't know
[32:58] we're not out on the streets like we
[33:00] used to we're not in the prisons like we
[33:02] used to
[33:02] we're not in a job like we used to but
[33:05] you know this was a dear subject to our
[33:07] prophet
[33:08] and when the prophet ministered this he
[33:10] was down with something that was
[33:12] troubling
[33:13] him down in his soul not even just the
[33:15] other ones but it was his self
[33:16] and his wife because he said him and his
[33:19] wife all that
[33:20] they had just got before one another on
[33:22] the stool and rededicated their lives
[33:25] before he preached this message before
[33:27] he ran this series
[33:28] that he was going to do we're not going
[33:30] to have an opportunity to go through it
[33:32] all but we're going to let him
[33:33] have his way in the way that he wanted
[33:35] to lead us and guide us is that right
[33:37] one thing i believe i tell you i know
[33:39] that this bible is true
[33:41] and i know that the words of the prophet
[33:43] is true and hell and god is opening some
[33:45] things up
[33:46] so some of you just hold on it's not
[33:48] going to be just
[33:49] going way back to when the prophet
[33:51] brought it but we're going to bring it
[33:53] up touch on some things
[33:54] why the holy spirit has your pastor in
[33:57] this area
[33:58] he preached this what he's preaching the
[34:00] prophet prophesied and talked about it
[34:02] back in 1959 so i want you to take your
[34:05] time and be prayerful with us tonight
[34:08] okay we got our time set up here and we
[34:11] ask you we know it'll be a great
[34:12] blessing to you
[34:14] we said here he said no and we got the
[34:16] inspiration from what is the holy ghost
[34:19] remember the prophet said he thought he
[34:20] asked you said what is the holy ghost
[34:23] what is the holy ghost given for how do
[34:25] you know it's for you
[34:27] and how do you know you have it right so
[34:30] we're going in there because in this
[34:31] hour here now
[34:32] so many people are being taught
[34:35] different things
[34:36] out there believing that they had the
[34:37] holy ghost
[34:39] is that right but we know god has sent
[34:41] us a message in this hour
[34:43] so i'm gonna do much reading it's gonna
[34:45] be like a sunday school lesson
[34:47] and have your pencils or your papers or
[34:49] you could turn in the scriptures
[34:50] but we're going to do some reading i
[34:52] don't have the powerpoint here tonight
[34:54] but we got our paper is that right
[34:55] hallelujah he said not upon this place
[34:59] we wish
[34:59] to approach this subject and this was
[35:02] 1959 12 1659
[35:05] and you know what is astonishing the
[35:07] devil is so in trouble brother steve
[35:09] i did not know it was 12 16 today
[35:12] it was 12 16 59 when he preached it it
[35:16] was 12 16
[35:17] today so it was no coincidence god is in
[35:21] control
[35:21] why would he preach this around this
[35:23] time of the year he said now look he
[35:25] said well
[35:26] he says think this is an outstanding
[35:29] subject today
[35:31] he said what is the holy spirit what is
[35:34] it
[35:34] and now the reason i have taken this
[35:36] subject in line
[35:38] you cannot come and receive the holy
[35:40] spirit
[35:41] unless you know what it is you cannot
[35:44] receive it
[35:45] if you know what it is unless you
[35:47] believe it's given to you
[35:49] and then and he said and it's for you
[35:52] and then you cannot know whether you got
[35:55] it or not
[35:56] or unless you know what results it
[35:59] brings
[36:00] so if you know what it is and who it is
[36:03] too
[36:04] and what action it brings when it comes
[36:08] then you'll know what we what you've got
[36:11] when you get it see he said now look
[36:15] i'm gonna drop down so y'all bear with
[36:17] me i'm gonna be jumping
[36:18] he says and that's the way with
[36:21] receiving the holy ghost see you've got
[36:23] to know
[36:24] what you are coming for and how to
[36:27] receive it
[36:28] and what it is see if we all come in
[36:30] here
[36:31] on one mind one accord for the same
[36:34] purpose
[36:35] you will have exactly what happened in
[36:37] the book of acts
[36:39] in the day of pentecost you will have
[36:41] your tongues
[36:42] you would have your interpretation of
[36:44] god you will have your prophecy
[36:46] because jesus christ is the same
[36:48] yesterday
[36:49] today and forever we're moving into
[36:52] something saints
[36:54] hallelujah what do you say brother kick
[36:56] the devil
[36:57] out you have no room in here
[37:02] this is the church of jesus christ okay
[37:06] we're moving into something in god's
[37:08] time hallelujah
[37:10] it is not anything complicated it's
[37:12] simple
[37:13] but you got to understand the foundation
[37:16] of he said now look
[37:17] the first place the holy spirit has been
[37:20] a promise
[37:21] it's a promise to us is that right
[37:25] he says no we could take ten weeks to
[37:28] skip the edges of this what the holy
[37:30] spirit is
[37:31] but the first thing i want to approach
[37:33] you just
[37:34] excuse me to just an outline
[37:37] hey let me ask him now i want to talk on
[37:40] it
[37:41] as the holy spirit being assigned we're
[37:44] going to
[37:44] as many things it's a seal it's a sign
[37:48] it's a comfort it's the eternal rest
[37:52] it's an advocate it is it's a deliverer
[37:56] it's your assurance it's your protection
[37:59] it's your witness it's the covenant
[38:02] we've been waiting on huh
[38:04] it's the promise we've been waiting on
[38:06] and it's the power of god
[38:08] they've been taking this holy ghost too
[38:11] lightly
[38:12] it's the power of god the devil cannot
[38:15] stand before
[38:16] each and one of you because you are huh
[38:19] your son's in orders of the most high
[38:21] god
[38:22] oh i tell you brother sean was here
[38:24] suddenly and rather sean he was just
[38:26] tapping in
[38:27] when brother steve came up sunday he
[38:29] said he told the court ones that sent
[38:31] him questions he said you need more the
[38:34] holy ghost
[38:36] i said well that's my confirmation he
[38:38] got around in there right
[38:39] and we're there when we was at the
[38:41] family meeting
[38:42] sister was talking about the holy ghost
[38:45] i said oh lord
[38:47] okay lord if you give me grace see you
[38:50] can't go into an
[38:51] area until god gives you grace to go
[38:54] into that area
[38:55] he's the boss he's in charge to write
[38:58] the footsteps of the righteousness it's
[39:00] the only other lord
[39:02] is that right hallelujah
[39:05] he said now look he says i want to talk
[39:08] to the holy spirit being a sign
[39:10] for it is a sign we realize that all
[39:13] promises is given to us
[39:14] by abraham was the father of the promise
[39:17] he said because god gave the promise to
[39:20] abraham
[39:21] and his what seed is that right
[39:26] after him the promise was made to
[39:29] abraham
[39:30] and to his seed is that right
[39:33] and this sign is to a what covenant
[39:37] people is that we gave it to a covenant
[39:40] people
[39:40] that he made an agreement with us is
[39:42] that right so you have people that's
[39:45] live streaming you have people that's
[39:48] coming in as
[39:49] visitors around and sometimes we assume
[39:52] that they know is that right
[39:56] the holy spirit give you grace to go
[39:58] back to an area for even if it's just
[40:00] one soul is that right
[40:02] because when understanding comes
[40:04] confidence comes with confidence come
[40:06] faith come and faith is a revelation is
[40:09] that right
[40:10] that's why in the message being
[40:12] misunderstood
[40:13] he was sharing them and that what they
[40:15] was being misunderstood
[40:17] they didn't recognize the presence of
[40:18] the holy ghost
[40:20] and that's what he that's what he's
[40:21] bringing him into the holy ghost would
[40:24] come and move the way
[40:25] he wants to move did you see the way
[40:27] brother sean
[40:28] started out and when he started out with
[40:30] his message and did you see the holy
[40:32] ghost take another channel
[40:33] he took another turn and he went
[40:35] directly to the gospel is that right
[40:38] somebody needed it hallelujah
[40:42] he said now look genesis 12
[40:48] hallelujah in here
[40:54] i want you to look here and see what the
[40:56] lord
[40:58] you know if you're writing them down
[41:00] genesis 12 then we're going to go to
[41:01] genesis
[41:02] uh 15. genesis 12
[41:06] let's look at verse 1
[41:09] it says and now the lord has said unto
[41:11] abram get thee out of thy coming from
[41:13] thy father's house
[41:14] unto a land that i will show thee he
[41:16] says i will make
[41:17] the great a great nation and i will
[41:20] bless thee

[41:29] thee

[41:41] he's down and they thought he said so
[41:42] abram what he was obedient
[41:45] to the word of god and abram departed as
[41:49] as the lord had spoken unto him and lot
[41:52] went with him abram is
[41:53] his 75 years old with he he departed
[41:57] out of heroin let's go to chapter 15.

[42:06] he says
[42:07] after this things the the things the
[42:09] word of a
[42:11] of the lord came unto abram in a vision
[42:14] saying fear not abraham i

[42:19] he's your fortune he's your buckler
[42:22] he's that and thy exceeding great
[42:24] rewards and

[42:28] what will thou give me seeing i go
[42:31] childless and the steward of my house is
[42:33] the eliezer of damacus
[42:35] and abram said behold to me thou has
[42:38] given no
[42:38] seed and lo one born in my house is my
[42:41] heir
[42:42] and behold the word of the lord came

[46:18] what
[46:18] exceeding and grace and precious what

[47:08] unto exceeding great and precious
[47:10] promises that by these
[47:12] ye might be what partaker of the divine
[47:16] nature hallelujah
[47:21] what is the holy ghost he says now look
[47:24] divine nature having escaped the
[47:27] corruption
[47:28] that is in the world through lust
[47:31] and besides this giving all diligence
[47:35] add to your what
[47:41] add to your virtue and to your knowledge
[47:46] after your temperance at two years
[47:49] of what i say patience
[47:53] godliness is that right that to your
[47:56] godliness
[47:58] brotherly kindness to your brotherly
[47:59] kindness
[48:01] charity is that right nothing above the
[48:04] charity
[48:05] but when he started out the prophet of
[48:07] god told us
[48:08] it was two seeds there is that right
[48:10] it's either faith
[48:11] or doubt huh so the word is being added
[48:15] to somebody
[48:16] faith seed or doubt seed is that right
[48:19] if you go to that scripture and you look
[48:21] the seed is already there he's saying
[48:23] you add to your faith
[48:25] when he got in there that's what the
[48:26] holy ghost was working with last
[48:28] wednesday
[48:28] he went to first peter he was talking
[48:31] about this what
[48:32] divine nature is that right look at the
[48:35] promise
[48:36] he said now and for if these things be
[48:39] in you
[48:39] and abound they make you that ye
[48:43] shall never be what barren or unfruitful
[48:46] and what the knowledge of
[48:48] our lord jesus christ hallelujah to give
[48:51] him a clap often
[48:52] he said now look he came in abraham
[48:57] look at his sign he said now i want to
[49:00] talk on it the holy spirit being a sign
[49:04] abraham was the father of the promise
[49:06] because
[49:07] god gave the promise to abraham and his
[49:10] seed
[49:10] the promise was made to abraham in his
[49:13] seed
[49:14] the sign is to a covenant people he says
[49:16] now
[49:17] there is a vast difference between a
[49:19] christian
[49:21] and a holy ghost hill christian
[49:26] let it sink in because that's why some
[49:30] what the prophet tell us he said you
[49:32] could be justified
[49:35] and not sanctified you could be
[49:37] sanctified
[49:38] and not have the holy ghost is that
[49:40] right i think that's first john
[49:41] 5 is it whoever everybody talks about
[49:44] that so he's telling us
[49:45] that's why he says the blood the spirit
[49:47] and the word is the father the spirit
[49:49] and the word is what
[49:50] one is that right those other three what
[49:53] agreeing one is that right
[49:55] but now we're becoming one with the
[49:58] father is that right
[49:59] he talked about the shadow is that right
[50:02] we're going to move away from that
[50:03] shadow he said closer you get to that
[50:06] shadow
[50:06] he says what that hand becomes what it
[50:09] becomes what
[50:10] one
[50:14] keep it so simple so a child can receive
[50:16] it
[50:17] is that right hallelujah look what he
[50:20] said
[50:20] he said now he said he said now there is
[50:24] a vast difference between a christian
[50:26] and a holy ghost-filled christian he
[50:28] says now we're going to get this
[50:30] from the scriptures and the place is
[50:32] just exactly in
[50:34] in the scriptures is that right he said
[50:36] now look said there is a christian
[50:38] professor to be a christian
[50:40] but if this christian has not yet
[50:43] been filled with the holy spirit he's
[50:46] only in what
[50:47] process is that right of becoming a
[50:50] christian
[50:51] so now we're talking about receiving
[50:53] this holy ghost is that right
[50:55] we're talking about your being the seed
[50:58] the abraham seed
[50:59] the faith seed the royal seed of god is
[51:02] that right
[51:03] i tell you what another scripture let's
[51:04] turn to galatians three
[51:09] we're looking at his ear because seeing
[51:12] his hour here now
[51:13] he's narrowing it down i like when the
[51:15] holy spirit had brother steve when he
[51:17] came
[51:18] see playing church is over with you know
[51:20] when the brother is talking about
[51:22] diligently you're talking about now you
[51:24] gotta when the holy spirit waking you up
[51:26] three o'clock or so in the morning you
[51:29] got to get on up and listen to that
[51:31] voice and be obedient
[51:32] to that holy ghost he's moving right now
[51:35] he's training you
[51:36] he's getting you prepared for something
[51:38] how are you going to tell these children
[51:40] about all night prayer how you going to
[51:42] tell these children
[51:43] about being obedient to the holy ghost
[51:45] how are you going to tell these children
[51:47] when the holy ghost wake you up at three
[51:49] o'clock in the morning and you praying
[51:51] until
[51:51] seven o'clock in the morning how are you
[51:53] gonna tell these children
[51:54] if you never went through it if you
[51:56] never experienced it is that right
[51:58] that's why god never left them without a
[52:00] witness is that right
[52:02] joshua knew about moses because joshua
[52:05] went to the mountain with moses
[52:06] he knew about fasting for 40 days and 40
[52:09] nights
[52:10] he knew those things is that right this
[52:12] is not going to be an intellectual
[52:13] conception
[52:14] of this message you either believe it or
[52:17] you don't believe
[52:18] it and this is not a play
[52:21] it's a war and people are
[52:23] misunderstanding the type of love
[52:26] this is not affiliated love this is the
[52:28] agra they love
[52:29] and god means what he said is that right
[52:32] when joshua came
[52:33] into the land this is joshua ministry
[52:36] joshua's on the scene now
[52:37] josh we didn't play with them demons
[52:39] just let him play with them devil
[52:41] we got a can you preach something in the
[52:43] camp the holy ghost gonna call it out
[52:46] he called a can and his whole family
[52:48] what did he say
[52:49] bring him here send the five full
[52:51] ministry at them
[52:56] up there the war so what's going on
[53:00] we get around in there food is going on
[53:03] in jeffersonville in different places
[53:07] look what the lord is doing hallelujah
[53:10] thank you jesus galatians six and nine
[53:14] let's look at six hallelujah
[53:18] he talked about the abraham covenant the
[53:21] agreement
[53:22] even as abraham believed god and it was
[53:24] accounted to him
[53:26] for what righteousness know ye therefore
[53:29] that thy which are of what faith
[53:33] the same or the what children of abraham
[53:35] that's what peter saw way back then
[53:37] peter was seeing that statute of that
[53:39] perfect man he was seeing the holy ghost
[53:41] working through your life
[53:42] that's why you think the pastor's just
[53:44] saying it just to be saying it
[53:46] cruz just said no no no no no no no no
[53:48] you see a little bird you want to be
[53:49] like a buzzer you want to be like a bird
[53:50] you know what those little birds do
[53:52] every time they want to go fly they go
[53:55] they got to work so hard they got to
[53:57] work so hard to get out there and work
[54:00] come on now we're in eagle food eagles
[54:03] go whoa whoa
[54:11] ah they feasted on the matter for this
[54:13] age
[54:14] they're getting ready huh getting ready
[54:16] just like brother sean was saying
[54:18] the lord came and bring us the word
[54:20] getting us ready for this showdown
[54:22] that's going on right now
[54:23] this thing is moving fast huh huh
[54:26] businessmen make an agreement with
[54:29] catholicism
[54:30] huh this is close at the door
[54:34] ain't no play play maybe that's why god
[54:36] gave me grace
[54:37] you be sure you got that genuine holy
[54:39] ghost in his
[54:40] hour here right now remember what the
[54:42] pastor said we got the family mean
[54:44] he said don't think you're so strong
[54:45] don't sit up in no stone
[54:47] peter thought he was too didn't he peter
[54:49] cast out devils
[54:50] when peter did what huh they healed the
[54:52] sick god they ran the devil off is that
[54:55] right
[54:55] he opened the eyes of the blind probably
[54:58] huh
[54:58] but then when they came back rejoicing
[55:01] rejoicing that the devil was subject to
[55:03] them but what did he tell what jesus
[55:04] tell them
[55:05] he said well rejoice not the devil
[55:07] because the devil is subject to you
[55:10] the devil is supposed to be subject to
[55:12] you
[55:13] the devil is supposed to back off when
[55:15] he sees you
[55:16] but he said rejoice because what
[55:26] book of life
[55:34] that's why he told him rejoice huh your
[55:37] name is in the book
[55:38] it's been signed by the blood the blood
[55:41] of god
[55:42] that was set on calvary and it can't be
[55:44] taken off
[55:45] is that right because the blood of god
[55:48] who came down and redeemed you
[55:49] no angel couldn't just come and get you
[55:52] the god himself
[55:53] had to come down and fulfill the plan of
[55:56] redemption
[55:58] ah that's right sister hallelujah
[56:03] look what he says hallelujah he says now
[56:07] verse 8 and the scripture foreseen that
[56:10] god would
[56:11] justify the heathen through faith
[56:14] preached
[56:15] before the gospel unto abraham saying
[56:19] in thee shall all nations be blessed
[56:21] look where the gospel was being preached
[56:22] way back then to genesis 12.
[56:25] he said so then they which be of what
[56:28] faith are blessed with what faithful
[56:31] abraham glory be to god
[56:34] keep reading he said now look
[56:38] now there's a vast difference he said
[56:40] the first place
[56:42] there's a there's a christian professed
[56:45] to be a christian
[56:46] he says but if this christian has not
[56:49] yet filled
[56:50] with the holy ghost he's only a process
[56:54] he is professed to be believe it he's
[56:57] working
[56:58] to it but god has not yet given him
[57:01] the spirit of the holy ghost he's not
[57:04] yet
[57:05] reached that goal with god that god has
[57:08] recognized it
[57:09] so let me stop and pause there see when
[57:12] god
[57:13] you got to understand judas and then was
[57:15] right there with them brothers is that
[57:17] right
[57:17] performing the sign performing the
[57:19] wonders brother steve
[57:20] we was all over there the tabernacle
[57:23] there together
[57:24] people would walk together but then
[57:26] they're finding out now when it's time
[57:27] to move forward and get the holy ghost
[57:30] judas showed his colors is that right
[57:33] when they got over there now it's time
[57:34] to perform the big
[57:36] the the book of acts judas showed his
[57:38] colors is that right
[57:40] the bible says who has believed our
[57:42] report
[57:43] and to whom are the arm of the lord been
[57:45] revealed to
[57:46] is that right the arm of the lord has
[57:48] been revealed to the one who believed
[57:50] the report
[57:51] is all based upon faith do you believe
[57:54] god can save your soul
[57:56] do you believe god can heal your body do
[57:58] you believe god can deliver you
[58:00] do you believe god is the one that came
[58:02] down and paid the price for you
[58:04] whom had believed that report huh who i
[58:07] believe
[58:08] the power of the all the power of god do
[58:11] you believe
[58:11] god is able to keep the corona from
[58:13] getting on you
[58:14] do you believe that god is able to keep
[58:17] that bullet
[58:18] from your family if you believe god
[58:20] they're able to keep you
[58:21] from your insurance going up do you ever
[58:23] believe god
[58:24] and believe you from your son going to
[58:26] get delivered
[58:27] not if he's going to get delivered he's
[58:29] going to get the letter
[58:30] who have believed our report is that
[58:34] right
[58:37] this is the real walk this is the hour
[58:40] saints
[58:41] this is the hour what is the holy ghost
[58:44] the holy ghost is power
[58:46] isn't that right hallelujah
[58:49] he said you recognize how god
[58:53] he says now see he is professed to be
[58:56] believe the works but god has not yet
[58:59] given him
[59:00] the spirit of the holy ghost he's not
[59:02] yet reached that goal
[59:04] or with god that god has recognized it
[59:07] so we now know the only one know if you
[59:09] have truly repented
[59:11] don't anyone know if you have truly
[59:13] believed god
[59:14] there's nobody but god god's the only
[59:16] one can give you the holy ghost
[59:18] god the only one come let's turn the
[59:19] attendant in ezekiel 36 it comes to me
[59:23] hallelujah when they get around there
[59:27] ezekiel 36 let's look here verse uh
[59:30] let's look at verse 16. you might have
[59:33] to jump around a little bit
[59:35] ezekiel 36 16. he said moreover the word
[59:37] of the lord came unto me
[59:39] saying see son of man when is that when
[59:42] he says when the house of israel dwells
[59:45] in thy own land
[59:46] so they defiled it by their what their
[59:49] own way it says and by their what
[59:52] on doing see god puts everybody on free
[59:55] more will
[59:56] this is a type here we know he's talking
[59:58] about the jews but brother branham went
[1:00:00] in this when he started talking about
[1:00:01] being born again and people
[1:00:03] understand being truly being born again
[1:00:05] when he got down there
[1:00:06] in in ezekiel he talked about this let
[1:00:09] us keep going just
[1:00:10] pray with me he said now before me as
[1:00:13] the unclean
[1:00:14] of the removed woman verse 18 he says
[1:00:16] wherefore i poured my fury upon
[1:00:19] them for the blood that they had shed
[1:00:21] upon the land and for
[1:00:22] their idols wherewith they had what
[1:00:25] polluted it
[1:00:26] he said then i scattered them among the
[1:00:28] heathen and they were what dispersed
[1:00:30] through the countries according to their
[1:00:33] way
[1:00:33] and according to their doings i judge
[1:00:36] judge them see that's what happens to us
[1:00:38] and then now some of us got in our
[1:00:40] situations
[1:00:41] because they recognized the devil
[1:00:43] recognized you wasn't
[1:00:45] operating according to the word of the
[1:00:47] lord is that right
[1:00:48] he know you wasn't doing what you were
[1:00:50] supposed to do so the devil be spying on
[1:00:52] us
