stand up brother deny and welcome to spoken word Tabernacle so you decode the mystery already God sent us a gift again you heard it yourself gift of God will always make their own places they will find their places God richly bless you there is one more talent that has been spoken of I'm waiting to see it I won't say anything just like you heard it this morning you will see it in expression amen glory to God I believe everybody are reading their Bible everybody are uh we are reading our Cod book our church edges the seals and the 70 weeks of Daniel Amen make sure you keep your word your head in the word not on television not on the information we listen to information for so long and there is so much lies on what is happening on the media let's keep our head in the word one chapter in the morning one chapter before you go to bed your pastor will always remind you that amen we had a wonderful question and answer yesterday I went home I went home and I felt like I just preached a whole sermon because it was so anointed until I have to tell the Deacon go ahead and record this so I can remember those answers because the answer was coming right away but unfortunately I'm not going to release that for the prophecy of the people because when I have questions and answer we interact with the people so I don't want people to go ahead and hear what other people were saying and it's all over the world no sorry talk to the people that were there and they can get it amen I just want to keep the answers so in case the new generation is coming up and they have the same age so the same question we can go ahead and handle it Lord's willing October the 21st brother Kelly if I'm not mistaken that's the next question and answer October 21st I have few questions left so almost finish all your questions unless you add them and Lord's willing we will try to dig into it one was hard we could not dig into it I believe it's the Holy Spirit we'll talk about the dreams when you have dreams who's supposed to tell you about the dream let's keep it that's fine everything will be okay sister Devon you let me know to confirm the topic with every sister we talked about it so make sure they're all in agreement you send me a text message shoot up the date and we go from there amen if I forgot something you let me know Deacon but I believe I got everything squared away so let's stand and go straight to the word of God amen foreign okay if you meet with me and you have a struggle in your life and I talked to you about it it doesn't stop me from preaching about it did it make sense so if you see me preaching about it don't think I'm talking about you because there could be somebody else who's struggling the same thing so it stays spiritual like that so when I'm moving on with the machine gun I'm not shooting you shooting the devil just know that it could be somebody else I've seen it many times you say something you talk to somebody you come and you and the Holy Spirit bring it and it's somebody else and the Holy Spirit bring it and it's somebody else so when you hear me saying don't say I was talking to the pastor and that's why he brought it to the pulpit because you're not the only one struggling with it so I'm saying this so you have peace when I'm shooting I'm shooting to the devil okay so if you come you tell me something it doesn't mean that never preach about it if it's the word that will continue to preach about it there is one thing I'm really grateful to God number one I don't have a bishop except the Lord Jesus Christ and I have freedom to deliver what God put in my heart because I Want to Be Free when I meet him I want to go to heaven please I want to go to heaven I don't want to stay here so I want to make sure I'm also clear to get in heaven we okay I love you so much but I gotta stay true to the world and I have to deliver the message the way it's given Deuteronomy chapter 30. love doesn't means compromise amen glory to God amen if you follow the sermon on Wednesday Brothers Aaron was already preaching the Sunday sermon those who got it you write in line Deuteronomy 30 verse 6 if you dare you can say Amen um but they were just a part of me just as much please amen you there amen and the Lord your God will circumcise your heart we already went through that because the heart need to be circumcised what happened in the flesh was already attacked but God was targeting the heart the Lord will circumcise your heart comma and the heart of your seed so the promise of circumcision is unto you and to your children and as many as the Lord your God will call do you see how the Old Testament the New Testament worked together you might be seated and to love the Lord your God we already went through this how the Holy Ghost comes and bring the love of God Amen to love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul that you may live so the purpose of the circumcision is that it brings the love of God he puts you together in invisible Union with God and God become the top of your life you love him above everything amen verse 7 and the Lord your God will put all these curses upon hope thine enemies well you see how being an enemy to a child of God is a problem you're bringing curses to yourself if you declare yourself an enemy to an elect you just open up a direct deposit from hell correct of curses amen and the Lord your God will put all these curses upon your enemies remember yesterday oh nobody anything except one thing love amen amen which persecuted you verse 8 and you shall return and obey the voice of the Lord and do all his Commandments which are commanded which I command you this day get ready now and the Lord your God will make you have plentice plantures in every word of your hand can you say amen amen so you can get blessing God so everything that you do is supposed to be have plenty years God Jesus gave the parable of the talent and everyone that have the parable uh everyone that received the talent had the potential to receive a hundred percent research the return even the one who refused if he would have put it to work it would have worked amen so when God gives you something he knows what he's doing amen God knows what he's doing amen he says he will make you planchous in every work of your hand in the fruit of your water Daddy and in the fruit of your water cattle and in the fruit of the water for water for good forever for the Lord will again Rejoice over you for good as he Rejoice over your father everybody okay watch verse 11. if you shall hearken we already dealt with the Eve if you shall hearken to the voice of the Lord your God to keep his commandment and his statute which are written in this book of the what law so there is a book called The Book of the law the book of the law amen this book of the law Israel in the Old Testament had the book called The Book of the law and in that book there are stuff that are written there and God said if you follow everything that is in that book amen verse 10 if you hearken if you hearken you shall hearken to the voice of the Lord your God to keep his commandment and his statute which are written in this book of the Lord and if you turn to the Lord your God and if you turn to the Lord your God with all your heart and we fall your soul for this commandment which I commend you this day is not hidden from you the Commandment is not hidden from you in other words the Commandment is available if he was sealed it is often are we okay this commandment is not hidden from you neither is he how far off so this book can be far off but God is saying it is no longer pharaoh in other words the book moved the book can move from one location Amen to another location and we know that the book of the law is the law of God it is God but God is saying that that book is no longer with me I know you're having trouble stay where you are let's go to chapter 33 and we come back let's go to chapter 33. we will see how this how did the Lord get to Israel okay okay chapter 33 just a few chapter you there amen verse two you there amen here brother Benjamin that is creating an echo because it's a bazooka try that one amen uh-huh that's it okay I'm starting to learn some tech stuff everybody okay verse two and he said the Lord came from what Sinai and Rose up from sale to them he Shone forth from Mount Paran and he came with ten thousands of water Saints so God came down with people I'm reading the Bible and when he came down watch clearly from water his right hand went a fiery law for them so the law I mean arrived to Israel by God coming down on the mountain the mountain of Sana God came down and God was had the company are we reading the same Bible and in the right hand of God are we okay now I'm reading the Bible in the right hand of God there was a law and the law came from the right hand of God amen so the law moved from heaven and came down to the Earth by God himself the Lord himself he descended on a mountain and we fellow on his right hand and he had the company to be more specific listen to Stephen here in the book of acting Stephen said who have received the law by the disposition of angels so we thought that it's just Moses talking and coming back God came with angels and he brought the law God Came Upon the mountain and met a prophet Called Moses Moses went to the mountain and met God the god that met Moses in the mountain came down with a book Amen in his right hand amen with angels to deliver unto Moses if you don't understand my language what's the picture over there because according to Revelation 10 the mighty Angel also came down the Lord himself came down with a book in his right hand and the book was open stop playing with mysteries in this message this message is the revelation of the Mysteries yes [Music] [Applause] we don't need the Deep Prince of God the Deep things of God move God down God could not give that to uh Gabriel the Lord himself [Applause] not anybody else the Lord himself amen the message of William Mayon Branham is the revelation of the mysteries of God love is a mystery sin is a mystery the serpent seed is a mystery amen so when we're preaching the mystery we're preaching everything amen I don't know where preacher gets the separation between oh we don't need to preach the Mysteries we need to preach the life of the people how can you separate the mystery with the life [Applause] this is why most of the churches hey I'm independent in this message look like Pentecostal foreign [Music] look like Baptists because they don't want to apply the mystery the mystery will separate you from denomination Pentecost of Hell brought upon and preach a message where the Pentecostal fell but this message won't fail [Applause] [Music] are you gonna impress a Pentecostal by Healing The Sick are you going to impress a pen because about speaking in tongues you need something higher a language they don't know [Applause] we preach the message we're preaching the message like Pentecostal and we begin to pump people the people are not pumped by emotion they pop by revelation [Applause] God wasted his time to preach to us the mystery that we don't need you don't need the seals to go to heaven so God wasted his time the angel of the Lord wasted his time God himself came down wasting his time it's an insult to the message [Applause] put me on tick tock we clear now we're clear now so let's go back to our server to our the Deuteronomy 30. [Music] it's all over the message you don't need the Deep things the Bible say for the spirit of the Lord searcheth the Deep things of God so if you don't know the difference I wonder if you got the Holy Ghost because the Holy Ghost searches the Deep things of God hey if you don't have the Holy Ghost come let's pray for you how can the holy ghost search the difference and you say we don't need the difference any salt to the Holy Spirit we don't need the 70 weeks of Daniel so why did they preach it [Music] the Mysteries the Mysteries the Mysteries is what is bringing young people here in this church I don't force them to come to church they are very honest when you talk to them the mystery is pulling them the Red Bull Shark when you begin to bring the first pool he just watches around you bring the second pool he's just watching around but when you open the world [Applause] without the opening of the word you can feel the church before you wanted the rainbow tract is attracted by one thing the opening of the world because when the world open it is releasing the name [Applause] and there is something in you that say wow that is nothing but the truth [Applause] [Music] they put me here for a purpose I will shoot until I get to heaven I'm not gonna back up I'm not intimidating I will stand for this message brother Branham said what happened before was the years of preparation you heard the sister singing here when his mystery come it's an indication of his love that's why the Capstone is love it is God bringing his own self [Applause] the book that was still now it's open when John saw that he began to Jubilee in heaven [Applause] our difference you can sing somewhere with this but if we begin to bring the word the Pentecost I will be sitting but the message believer you see them on fire because the world is coming brother Branham says the restoration of the word bring the restoration of the power God sent his word to heal you [Applause] foreign okay clean up the stuff if you need coat I can sit with you five hours and continue to give you coat after coat after court after court [Music] this message and when I open my bible every day I see something new because of the seals [Applause] [Music] how many people [Music] if you don't understand something stay on your gift but don't attack the other one because you can't drive into the deep [Applause] [Applause] brother Branham said that was the things that I was looking all my life is this guy right here brother Branham said he was the seventh seal and when he looked at brother Branham he's like this brother Branham say everything else was familiar that's the difference without that you were denomination [Applause] don't worry if you can't swallow this wait for what is coming amen have I lost anyone do you need a CPR you will have praise God we got nurses here so I'm fine everybody okay verse 11 for this commandment which I commend you this day is not hidden from thee it's open amen neither is he how far off watch verse 12 because I told you it was coming from somewhere it is not in water heaven that I mean Revelation 10 verse 1 the mighty angel came down from heaven is it complicated it is not in heaven that you should say who shall go up for us to water heaven and bring it to us that we may do What hear it we might hear it and what else do it hear it and what plus what do it Faith cometh by water hearing and when you hear it what do you do you got even the title of the sermon so when they're bringing the book down it's for you to hear the book and to do it in other words the book have a specific information that will put you in action amen verse 13 neither is he beyond the water the sea if you're in Africa you can access the book God will open the voice of God to send you the book so you don't say it's overseas say amen amen I don't have any camp but I'm free okay but God will send you the book over there so you don't say that okay we are far away from America we cannot receive the book God will send it in other words no excuse amen amen he said neither is he beyond the sea that you should say who shall go over the sea for us and bring it to us that we may do What hear it and water do it the commission is the same are we clear but the word is where very nigh unto thee the word was in heaven then he moved from Heaven he came down on Earth when he came down on Earth he was given to a prophet Moses and Moses took the word and delivered that to the people and when the world is delivered to the people God say the word now is closer to you it is no more in the right hand man sitting on the throne it is closer to you right now when we say closer we usually look at the word beside me let's see where that word is amen today it's gonna get in you and you're gonna speak it [Applause] [Music] Lord father please help me get where I'm trying to get he said but the word is well very nigh unto thee not denial but very very nice and today so maybe somebody will say me and the world we are tied together like this let's see where the word is what does it mean very nigh unto thee in your water mouth how did he get in your mouth John come up here and do what he takes the world do what take the book do you know he was taking the book from who from who in heaven somebody heard that book and no one was worthy to touch that book even to look at the book but when the angel come down the angel look at John he said come and take it because John said can you give it to me he said no you're not the one who took in heaven you and him are the same [Applause] you can take it just the way he did it [Music] that's why I take this message [Applause] amen I take the sins I take the 70 weeks of them I take Revelation for this day this scripture is revealed the perfect Perfection and Faith definition who is this Melchizedek I take everything [Applause] hello because the world must be found in my mouth [Applause] why your mouth [Music] not in your hand in your mouth why your mouth why when the day of Pentecost when the Holy Ghost come the first thing he touches the mouth of the people and the people begin to speak in a different lungs what is in the mouth so they weren't being closer is in the mouth Hallelujah verse 14 but the word is very nice unto you amen in your what mouth come on in your water mouth Karma and in your heart how did he get in your heart in the mouth and in the water heart [Applause] make some connection here electrician add us the abundance of the heart the water mouths [Music] [Applause] so before you get into the Mafi was first wear in the heart and when it's in the heart it's gonna bubble amen deadly begin to come out sometimes you want to close it but the world is [Applause] don't worry my friend amen but the word is very near unto you in your water now and in your water heart that you may water do it number one from the heart where it's the same the center of Revelation and then when he moved from the heart he goes to the mouth when he moved to the mouth it's gonna move now into doing it heart mouth doing it hurt math action today you will know what the third pool is heart Den moth aftermath do it this is the Old Testament amen amen let's go to Roman 10. father help me amen the devil play a lot with people you can't rob me from this message you don't believe it stay over there that's why we in the message but we don't believe the same thing by we in the message but we don't believe the same thing some are Pentecostal message Baptist message Methodist message Presbyterian message that's why when they leave the message they will go to a Presbyterian Church when they leave the message they go to a Pentecostal because they were Pentecost surrounded the message but me a message under the message so I can't go nowhere [Applause] in other words I'm a thoroughbred message [Applause] you left the message you go to the Baptist and you come you were a Baptist you are a Baptist you leave the message you a Jehovah Witness you are a Jehovah Witness Under the Umbrella of the message but me you know when I when you see this water this water is outside of me I the water is here I'm moving he said why are they moving I'm moving is the water moving now watch what happened a portion of the world that is in me when I move what is the body do you see it behind me when I move the message move [Applause] me and the water are one try to get in me and find where it is now that's why they thought John take the book and do it so when John is moving where is the book inside of him when John is sleeping where is the book If you can't find the message come and see me the message is in me foreign if you can't find the court come and see me I am the message [Applause] Romans chapter 10 verse 8. if you dare you can say amen amen the people came and asked for the wealthy father did you see them telling them go to that church he said so you were looking for a place this is the address your GPS sends you correctly your GPS was supposed to tell you you have a raft because I am that Revival I am the message you ever I'm gonna show you in a few minutes Lord help me uh Roman 10 verse 8 if you dare you can say amen amen the Bible say but what say the word Israel neither you remember where it's coming from even in your water mouth and in your water heart watch the world that is the word of what faith now we're more clear because Paul is a prophet he's opening this thing now that word is not just word it's the word of water Faith you see me saying Revelation here it is the word of faith in other words you have received a revelation amen it is the word of faith amen which we do what preach so what I'm preaching right now God is sending you words [Music] let me continue Lord help me verse 9. that if you do water shall confess with your water mouth okay the word must be in the mouth now Paul is telling us what is the month supposed to do the mouth is supposed to do what brother Branham said confess means to repeat the same thing do you know what confess means do you know the one who delivered the box to you he's not supposed to open the box he's supposed to just take the box the way he receive it and deliver that that's why the prophet of odd used to say that's safe in other words not me it is that safe the Lord in other words my intellect my preferences is not added to this I'm just delivering what I received from the Lord exactly the way I receive it we okay now verse 9 that if you shall confess with your water now that the Lord Jesus Christ the Lord Jesus Christ and shall have believe with your water heart do you see what it is in the heart that were faith is amen and believe with your heart that God raised him from the water the dead you shall water be saved so what comes here when he gets here he will produce what he was sent for they're sending a package from Amazon you take the package you bring it home when you open you will know what is in the package we clear let's deliver our package this the way it's supposed to be delivered verse uh that was verse 10 verse 10 for with the heart man do what Believe It Believe to water righteousness and with the mouth confession confession is made to utter salvation so you can not only believe with us speaking everybody okay everybody okay and you cannot speak without doing it one push to the other one make a way for the other if you believe your mouth begin to get some anointing when your mouth begin to talk your body want to move yeah everybody clear let's go to the last one James chapter two oh God if you dare you can say a man James come after Hebrew glory to God James chapter 2. very very familiar scripture 17. amen even so what faith if he has not what works it is out dead being water in other words it is impossible to have faith without work impossible if there is a faith without work you don't have faith it's a dead faith Verse 18 yeah a man say you have faith and I have works show me your faith without work and I will show you my faith by my works I will show you my faith by my words that's why brother Branham say words is Faith Express so the words that you do here is only an expression or a manifestation or a reflection of your faith everybody clear verse 19 you believe that there is one God you do well the devil also believe why is it not change because we can't go to that process and tremble verse 20 but will you also will you know oh van man that faith without work is how there was not Abraham Our Father justified by what works when he had offered Isaac his son upon the altar see you have faith working what with his work and by work was Faith made how perfect that word perfect usually means complete so what start here is incomplete amen until it's put in action when we reach the action then your faith is perfect oh your faith is complete all your faith has reached its goal we clear so far for a team I'm gonna get this one the Bible says in Revelation 12 verse 11 and they overcame him the devil by water the blood of the Lamb you know in this message when we say the blood of the Lamb we usually looking for some liquid that I read when you meet Jesus in the air we live bleed Jesus already have a transformation he had the glorified body can you go into glorify body and pull blood but but the Bible says here that they will overcome him by the blood of the Lamb when we say blood in this message we have Pentecostal thinking we think about the liquid that is red with plasma and you leave it there and it begins to dry that's not the blood that one was done in Calvary and if you go to California you can search all around you won't even find a drop of it and if we would go to the body of Jesus Christ and withdraw all the blood he won't surface all of us because it is a multiple of people that were saved what is the blood because we will overcome by the blood brother Branham says in the message they took it he said God only recognizes what the token what is the token which is the blood that was pulled the token was the blood that they put over there God called that the token or the Sun but what is the token brother Branham say that is the message of the hour amen so the message of the hour is the blood of dilemma amen [Applause] no message no blood [Music] can I continue can I continue when you remove the message from a church you are removing the blood from the church amen when you don't want to preach the message in the church when you don't want to quote the message in the church you are actually removing the blood [Applause] from the people can you say Amen can you say a man brother Branham say that is the message of the hour that is the message of this day that is the message of this time in the name of Jesus Christ receive it what is the blood they shall overcome by the blood of the Lamb which blood you will overcome by the message of Yahweh it stumbles you a little bit swallow this one my friend brother Branham say in the message the Rapture one day there will come a blast From Heaven and the dead in Christ shall do water rise first them Old Testament sent back Yonder who are waiting Will Blast forth and come out of and come out there first and go into the water the resurrection we shall drop right in line going into the water the sky these all Mortal body change and made like unto his own glorious body what a parade that shall be when it start out Heaven were some of this day in that Rapture in time that lays where ahead oh Bradley water displaying the blood 25 school zone 25 miles an hour please my friend Bradley displaying water the blood of Jesus the blood of Jesus Christ upon the water yes so when we are going to heaven we must have the blood on our chest now if the blood is the liquid how are we going to get that liquid because the one who have the blood is in love he's waiting for us in the air but when you go toward him you must have a blood right there on your chest what is the blood he said proudly displaying the blood of Jesus Christ upon the water yes the message of God in the hour that the water lived there so the blood is your message amen [Music] let's go back again in Revelation 12 now let's read it again and day of the camp by water the blood of the Lamb now it changes how do you overcome the devil how can I overcome the devil now the message of the day you remove the message in the church no blood you don't want to read the message no blood you're rejecting the message that came done with the mighty Angel we don't need those seals you are removing the blood from the people and thinking you're preaching the message they will overcome him by the water blood of the Lamb comma and bite the water word of their testimony so somebody must speak you don't you don't overcome just by the message because they told John when you take the book you do what now you have the message you have the blood but they say to John that you must also do what you must prophesy again because somebody already prophesied Revelation 10 7 but we as the bread we must prophesy again we must repeat what the messenger already say you overcome by the blood of the lamb and by the word of your testimony and they love not their lives and to what the death any question so far let's pray Heavenly Father Lord we are approaching you humbly this morning Father thanking you for your grace your love and your mercy and for everything you have been doing for us father we are committing once again this service unto their hand Lord may you move me completely out of the way may you come and speak to our soul this morning Lord as we're waiting and expecting from thee in the name of Jesus Christ amen my subject this morning I'm good in town is the four phases of roof faith in Word and in action faith faith in Word and then your faith is complete we clear we clear now we understand clearly Where We Are you got the Holy Ghost you're in the holiest you're waiting for the Rapture and then you go but before you go to the rapture you're not gonna go like a coward you're not gonna leave this earth like somebody that was desperate and God is coming to rescue you you are living from this Earth Prada amen and you turn around you say devil you got it I will come back amen amen you tell the devil you say I'm coming back when Armageddon come you see me and when you see me on a white horse you see me I'm coming and when we finish Armageddon I go to the honeymoon and after the honeymoon God get murder is there and I will judge you in other words we are not living here powerless that's why the book was sent down to make a church that's gonna be victorious a church that look like God a church that have restored Adam back on Earth in other words we tell the devil you know what you did to Adam now you got it you are paying for what you did to Adam in other words you want to see Adam again on display before we leave here I'm not gonna live without the restoration because the book was already paid for and the book is no longer in heaven the book is now on the Earth but it's not with William Mayan brother Branham already gave me the book [Applause] and the book is the title in other words they give me some right some power and authority what are we dealing with my friend brother Branham says this that what we need today is what my friends some real genuine Faith put into actions we need real genuine Faith that's number one so when you have real genuine Faith you're already good but it's not good enough that Faith must be put in action brother Branham said we need some real genuine Faith how put into action yes sir we need real faith and man who dared to put God's word to the what heart and water apply it to who themselves not only Heroes doers you take the word you put it in your heart but it doesn't stay there you take that word you apply it to yourself you know how you apply lotion you apply the word to yourself every morning you put lotion you apply the word to yourself you say you buddy you must shine you must reflect the message you must be in good health you must look good you must be bright like Moses don't worry my friend the good thing is you swallowing so it's gonna come back brother brought them say our religion must become water in action Christian religion is what in action a Christian religion is a nation it is Jesus Christ himself in water action that what can so my life is no longer my life that's why Paul said the life I live now I leave it by the faith of the son of God we clear so far let's continue to clumber brother Branham says this they're Heroes of the Old Testament Headwater faith put it in that they didn't stop at having faith When Faith come they went to action they put it in action you got them for an example now we got faith but you won't put it in action right away on the powers of the Holy Ghost there is a prophecy in the Old Testament the prophecy of Zechariah 9 verse 9. the Bible says this that Rejoice greatly o Daughter of Zion shout oh daughter of Jerusalem behold that King cometh upon thee he is just and having salvation lonely in other words humble and riding upon in US and upon a court they fall off in Us in other words they ask that he will be driving will be a young one and if he's a call he's a four because they have not broken that ice that that us yet in other words nobody have read in their eyes yet everybody okay so according to this picture we are looking at the king a king that is coming that is riding on us amen that King is humble because he came in humility but when he's coming in glory that's a different story he came he's coming humble and we will see the daughters of Jerusalem rejoicing amen that's the picture so this one is something it's a foundation that was placed there by the prophet now how to make this this word that's the problem now when he come come to this prophecy this is what happened the Bible says in Mark chapter 11 verse 1 that when they came nigh to Jerusalem and to Bedford and Bethany at the Mount of olive he sent the forth two of his disciples we don't know who they are when he sent them for the Passover it was Peter and John this one I don't know unless I see brother Brown I'm saying that and the Bible says and say unto them go your way Jesus was not sending this disciple just like that Jesus already have a foundation in the scripture that spoke about him in other words he was not venturing without a promise he already have something in the Bible that back him up [Music] so when he's going he has a scripture he has a promise he has something that was already pressed there for him and upon the authority of that vision upon the authority of this prophecy Jesus begin to move when he moved he takes to disciples in other words those two disciple were Unwritten in this prophecy in other words this prophecy has a written part and an Unwritten party the written part is the king is coming on the horse but how did the King get the horse it's not taking it it's not saying anything down hidden in the Thunder [Applause] everybody okay which disciple is he gonna use we don't know they therefore don't know it is hidden under the seals everybody okay so Jesus is coming he tell the disciple he said go your way into the village offer against you and as soon as you enter into it you shall find a quote time precision where on never man said because he's a foe amen he has not been broken yet to break a horse it doesn't mean to take him and cut him no it's just to master him amen he says we're on never men sat and you do it lose him and what bring him not everybody can do this Jesus had many disciples he chose two when you are chosen father your choosing [Applause] [Music] all of them are disciple but they were not part of that vision so you have a project for your own life follow your leadership when God say move you move don't look at your brother over there it doesn't mean your brother is massive but what I'm accomplishing now he's not part of it [Music] God knew who will believe it and who are believer this disciple never questioned Jesus Christ they say go they went Jesus said when you go you found the court these are the description what do you do lose him if you intellectual you're going to start asking questions ready amen but Jesus gives them another package we clear verse three and if any man say unto you uh-huh at the beginning you don't talk to nobody follow me carefully you just go and do [Applause] it is not finished yet Jesus said if anybody If any man say unto you what do you do this in other words when you are entering the vision you will find a position when you're going to Egypt to pull Israel you will find your position everybody okay everybody good when you enter in division to do what God wants you to do opposition will rise up in the will of God in the path of Duty opposition will rise up expect the devil thank you are we okay are we good he says when they say to you why do you do this say ye that the Lord not Jesus the Lord do you know what Lord means ownership where did Jesus buy that donkey tell him that the honor the Supreme owner tell him that the Supreme the top on them the master of the Sabbath need it because everything that was created is mine so when they question you I am the one who sent you tell them that purple the top the Lord has need of him and straight away he will send him how hither so when opposition rise up you can't keep your mouth shut everybody okay when you are fulfilling God's word in your life an opposition begin to rise up don't keep your mouth shut make that therefore no [Applause] that listen to me very carefully I'm not venturing myself I'm not doing this just like that I believe a message and because of the message that's why I'm doing what I'm doing so you better shut up [Applause] are we together are we together let's see who spoke the Bible says and they went their way and found the code Tie by the door that's already an action of faith without a place where two ways meet let's leave that alone at the intersection and they did water lose him and a certain of them that stood there so what they were doing that people were standing watching them you need faith my friend in other words God wants you to rise higher [Applause] because the devil is shooting at that time they will take you as Thief you know uh they will call the police on you ah they will do this ah and they will take you to jail everything but they must bypass all of that get there and notice when they are losing the court nobody speak when they begin to go their way that's when the opposition was up Are We There Are We There the Bible say certain of them that stood there say unto them why do you lose why do you losing the code who is there those people listen to The Book of Luke say as this as they were losing the court they were the owners so the one who was in opposition is not just anybody it is the honor of the animal he owns the animal that's why Jesus tell him to say tell him the master owner if he is a president tell him the president of the president taught you to do that amen and the Bible says glory to God that and they say unto them even as what Jesus Headwater commanded they repeated exactly what Jesus gave it to them and they did what let them go so when you are entering a vision everybody care and you are implementing something when opposition come up you cannot keep silence let's continue to move slowly glory to God Amen let's go to Isaiah 55. thank you Jesus Isaiah 55 if I pass this then I'm soaring quickly we are very good on time Isaiah 55 if you dare you can say amen amen verse 8. pages are still turning if you're there you let me know Isaiah 55 verse 8. for my thoughts are not your thoughts I'm glad for that in other words what I'm thinking is not what God is thinking what my little brain is thinking when my little brand is blocked it's not what God is thinking when I say I'm done it's not what God is thinking I'm glad for that amen for my thoughts are not your thoughts neither are your way your plan that you make my way says who the Lord in other words we have our plan and his plan our thought and his plan and he stopped and they are done the same we clear verse 9 for us the heaven I hired to the Earth so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your water in other words what God has for you will pass your mind that's why they say hell Mary you are well faithful it is beyond that's why they say Gideon Mighty Men of value it is beyond it might be made of out of me his daughter higher so get used to something you don't even have in your mind when God is bringing to you don't be afraid when God tells you something that you see like I don't deserve this one it's an indication that it belongs to you [Applause] [Music] because his way are not your ways his daughter not your thoughts when you disqualify yourself that's when he qualifies you it's called paradox we clear verse 10 the Bible says for us the heavens our first thing for us the rain comes well down and the snow from water heaven and returneth not there but do what watereth the Earth we got two things here we got water which is really watery and we got snow that is a little bit more firmer those two amen comes and watered the Earth why amen as the for us the rain comes down and the snow from heaven and return not there so the rain when it comes down it will go back amen it is wired to come down and to go back amen but he will not go back until let's read it but Waters the Earth and makes it bring water forth and bird fourth and bad that he may give seed to the water sower and bread to the water eater Isaiah is saying when the water comes down and it rains and water the grass and everything that rain is supposed to go back where we came from but he won't go back everybody okay until he have finished its mission are we together and the mission of this rain Isaiah say is to bring forth and to bother and what else my friend that it may give seed to the sower to give seed let's go straight when the earth is bringing forth it means something was in the Earth are we together so the red was not really coming from the Earth are we together are we together are we together so the Earth has a mystery that's why I say mystery you gotta love mysteries this is the Earth maybe you have some trees here amen and then there is some rain dropping here like today amen the Bible says when the rain comes it doesn't go back because there will be an evaporation that would suck everything up back again into the into the heaven but the Bible says he won't go back until it have fulfilled its mission and when they come down and he watered the grass its Mission we will see certain things begin to stick out are we together when this thing begin to stick out the rain has finished its Mission and the rain now can go back so the ram is coming back not for the Earth but the uran is coming back for what is inside the Earth in other words the rain is coming for revelation we don't know what is in the Earth if there is no rain because what is in the earth is hidden if there is a seed there do you follow me this seed we don't know what it is we don't know whether it's a corner or whether it's a wheat we don't know we need the rain everybody okay so when the rain come the rain will get and water the Earth in other words the wind that's a stop here brother Robert impervious the word will be the the rain will begin to go down and just something in the Earth whatever was in the Earth was alive but sleeping are we together are we together and the red will Quicken that up [Applause] help me understand this so we can move on the Bible says in Deuteronomy 32 verse 2. my Doctrine we don't love Doctrine in this message my Doctrine shall drop us water the rain [Music] oh no we don't like the doctrine in this message we don't like those mysteries in this message my Doctrine or my teaching shall drop us water the rain my speech shall distill us the water do as the small rain upon the tender water and as they shower upon the Water Christ so God when he said that's why move will come the teaching Reign before the Harvest rain [Applause] have to come first to water the grass so when the teaching is coming the teaching is going to the seed and begin to wax the seed up let me help you up your body is made of the Earth this body is made of the earth when you die we will put you in the cemetery you will be part of the earth so this Earth Here need rain we okay now and the red that is coming on you is not really coming for this it's coming for what is inside of you we okay now and what is inside of you there is a predestinated seed that God blessing you as a child of God so when the rain is coming when God is teaching you those Mysteries it is entering in you and sitting right there where the cities everybody together are we together and when the rain catches the seed he turned the seed on he quickened the seed yeah everybody okay everybody okay and the seed begin to do what to bring forth or the seed begin to come to germatize the seed so the seed can come out once he does that the rain goes back your body is the Earth inside your body there is a predestinedity that's why God sends this message not really for this one but the message is following the predestination and once the message entering to you it quickens you up are we together are we together are we together when you are quick and what happened [Music] you following me let's go back to verse 10. as the rain comes down and there's snow from heaven and return not there but do water water is the earth wonder if the Earth and make make it brings worth a forth and do what but the purpose comma that image water give seed to the sower stop are we following me please put your seatbelt good once you are quickened this seed will come out when the seed begin to come up the seed will bring two things you're following me the seed will bring another seed are we together but this seed is for the sower another word for future use [Music] follow me carefully my friend I don't want to lose you I don't want to lose you let's go back my friend check somebody's hand and say stay up amen the Bible says that's exactly the word amen the Bible says for us the rain come up and the snow from heaven and return not there but do water water is the earth you understand what it means now and makes it bring forth water and bird because there was a seed there now we know the seed is unfolded watch carefully that he may give seed to the water sour this seed is kept for future you it's kept not to be eaten but to sow follow me carefully for so to give seed to the sower Karma and water bread to the eater are you following me when the seed is coming forth he bring two things in your life you you there with me it brings forth a seed for future use but he will also give you something for the present time [Applause] let me start it again read my friend he gives seed to the sower and water bread to the eater bread to eat this is for the present so when your word you'll see this Quicken it will first take care of the immediate need do you follow me and he also provide for the future need there it is before I explained that let's read again verse 11 so shall my water word God is comparing all of this to his word so shall my word be that goes forth out of water my mouth it shall not return to me how void but it shall do what accomplish that which I water please prosper in the things wherein to add water sent it so God said his word for a purpose and that word will never come back to God without fulfilling the purpose that God sended [Applause] [Music] this message will never go back to God without the message fulfilling that which God sent the message to do let me narrow that to your life so when the word come he Quicken you see it do you follow me a wolf Quicken your seat to bring two things number one it will give you what you need for the immediate action and number two it will also give you something for the future in either word this is the seed follow me the seed is a word Jesus say my seed is the word the predestinated cities away so when you are quickened you are producing the word but the word for future use in other words when God does something in your life it'll help you for that present time but what God did for you become the word of God [Music] let me state it again let me state it again let me State It Again David one day was keeping his fathership follow me please okay a Lion King David had an experience with God and killed the lion he helped David in that time but he was a seed for the future come on are we together are we together are we together another day a bear came yes yes and David killed the bear when David killed the bear he served David at the present time he provided bread for David at that time but he was also a seed for David to sow in the future do you follow me do you follow me when David met Goliath David now used the seed he said that God that delivered me from the Lion the god that delivered me from the bear he will deliver me for this and seek himself finished him [Applause] everybody together so what God is doing in your life as a testimony is also the word of God in other words your life is running the Bible [Applause] the Bible that we read is what God did with Abraham he helped Abraham in that time but he was the word for future use today we begin to say the god of Abraham what you going through is not only to deliver you for the present time but somebody else can use your testimony for the future in other words when I go to trial I save God if you deliver me from a kidney trouble [Applause] you can also do it again is the word for the time [Applause] everybody clear the woman that was in Tennessee that the child was dying she opened the Bible she looked at the sunamite that was an experience for that day that he was a seed for future time she said God where is Elijah so your life is written a pizza what God does in your life will be helping somebody else that's why never give up don't go back whatever happened in your life you are riding your pieces you are riding a bubble somebody might not read the Bible when they watch you he gives them the word for the hour [Applause] you think you're going to trial your trial you're riding another Bible [Applause] that's why Christ in the church is a continuation of the book of actors in other words you cannot put a period on the revelation when you talk to people and they are down you say you're done I was in the same situation like you say really yes I passed the same situation about you I could not have a child but you know what we pray and God give me a chance you already have a child it was bred for you but now it becomes seed to the soul now you are sowing you are giving it to somebody so somebody can use it that's why everything that goes in your life all things work together for what the good Hallelujah don't hide your testimony if God delivers you from alcohol say it to somebody else because he's the same yesterday today and forever your testimony is a word for someone your testimony is a word for your children you can tell your children God deliver me [Applause] it's a blood for the time and the word for the future so when God is coming in your life he's not coming just to bless you but he's running another episode God wants to write your life he wants to tell everybody that this is what I can do look what I was look what I am now you want my God come here I'm gonna show you the god that is [Music] [Applause] [Music] are we together so never regret what you're going into your life God is writing another Bible over there he was Abraham today is said to be [Applause] over there he was where is the god of Elijah today where is the god of William Mayon Branham the nature of this day your trial is the Bible whatever you go through is a Bible because your word has been quickened and God is making another history in your life [Applause] don't let your trial put a complex on you no use your child you say I'm using that as an example this is a testimony there will overcome by the blood of the lamb and by the word of my testimony Oh Glory to God glory to God never get complexing God knows what he's doing Abraham didn't know that there were children down the road that's going to use his example job didn't know what he was going he's going to help somebody he helped him in that time but he was seed for the future how many people claim on job how many people claim on Mary Magdalene a woman that is a prostitute can use rehab and say father you use rehab you can sell my family through me you thought he was a prostitute God was riding his Bible [Applause] because God knew somebody will be a positive but that in the shop they will have a predestinated seed let me lay the foundation for future use somebody who killed someone can use Moses Moses kill an Egyptian god use him [Music] [Applause] brother Branham say those that have blemished outnumber those that their life seems to be perfect the people God used Amanda so we can look we say he did it for this one and in the same condition that's it everything worked together for good because it's going to work for the present time it will also work for the future you can use it and move on father I pray you gave me this I pray you gave me this honey don't worry do you remember how God pass us the same God will do it again let's go to sleep it's used for the future it become a testimony he encourages you glory to God [Applause] let me skip this one my friend let me go straight now to the point so we can get where we're supposed to get devil not at this time oh God gracious not at this time Amen brother Branham says so what is faith faith is something that is revealed to you father help me Faith is something that is revealed to you that is not yet but you believe it will be faith is a revelation of the will of water God it's what God wants to do that's why Faith have no doubt because you know that that's what God wants to do help me up my friend we still have time I'm just sowing in eternity the Bible says in Hebrew 11 verse 3 through water faith we understand that the worlds where water refrain by water the word of God so that the fix which are sin were not made by things which water do appear in other words they came from the invisible hold tight my friend when we say the world was framed by the word of God how that what does it mean because when we say the word we're thinking about the Bible that word is a living person it's called the logos in Psalm 33 verse 6 the Bible said by the Water World by the word of the Lord where they have and how may and all the hosts of them by the water breath of his mouth now we begin to get it clear in other words somebody spoke somebody heard something in his mind and he didn't keep it to me to himself but he expressed it verse 9 for God did what to spake and he was water done he did what command it and it was water stood fast so whatever happened here came by this way are we clear are we clear let's get to our territory brother Branham Say by that same says God spoke when there was nothing what is that sense hope God the faith of God went in you the part of God that comes well into you give you the water super sense by the same Super Saiyan God did what to frame the world together which with things which was not and did not water appear he did what spoke his word believed his word so when God was speaking brother brother say God when he spoke he believed what he spoke [Applause] when you speak you must know who you are and you must believe what you're saying based on who you are we okay brother Branham said he spoke his word and did what believed his word and the word shook into water existence Glory [Music] so how did God create his talk what his he believes and he came to pass what did he have nothing but the word [Music] father help me brother brought them say when you get Faith In Hope Jesus Christ Working In Perpetual water motion where in your soul in other words your faith begin to shake it's bubbling in you brother Branham says something is going to other take place sin and water sickness will do whatever get away from you he didn't say You're Gonna cast them out amen when the woman at the well said that I perceived that you are the Messiah amen and Jesus said I am he who prayed for her who cast our Devils she had five six husbands the sixth one he was not her who cast the devil who changed her life when the faith get there the devil look you say everybody okay that's why that when they're opening when God opened his word and he entered into you you might not see what is happening but some things are moving out [Applause] brother Brown I'm saying sin and sickness will do what get away from you therefore was scattered like water roaches on the floor in the water summertime when the light is water turned on when God turn your predestinedity down we pay too much attention to our weaknesses [Applause] we better be our weaknesses too much and we even speak too much about them my father had blood pressure my mother had this problem Mama don't worry say you stayed there until Revelation comes and I will see who will move [Applause] I don't care which family I'm born into it I don't care what is in this body I care about what is inside what's Revelation is in every devil knows you got it [Applause] if you're waiting for long prayers line you are wasting your time that's the first pool only touching in the body that's not for the blood the blood is when the world is coming you open your mouth [Applause] that's it whatever is going in high blood pressure taken care of sugar diabetes taken care of hormone problem taken care of because because they want that entering you is the surgeon he himself knows where the problem is if it's a female traveler he fix it if it's a kidney he look at your kidney she needs a new one [Applause] tomorrow you go to the doctor they enjoy your blood your sugar is good what do you eat what did you are you taking the medication no the world that God enjoyed [Music] I'm still good my friend let me push a little bit see where we can get brother Branham say when you say you got faith forward Divine Healing and something struck you and say what move out that is the confirmation that God has received your faith for what Divine Healing that's right when you got courage to put your faith in water action but when you say you got faith and afraid to let it go your faith is half dead [Music] but when you get Faith and willing to water let it go then God is confirming it with water the signs following and you shall see your water healing in other words when you act upon your faith God said hey this boy locked me up yes sir I must I must react because once he moved like this I don't want to play with my reputation this boy everybody knows him in the in the neighborhood everybody knows him at work so I better heal him quickly before this message get in trouble in either way you are forcing God when you begin to act one stuff you are pulling God like wake up let me move on let me move on listen to all this the Bible said death and what life our way in the power of the tongue and they they love it shall do what eat the fruit thereof so I need to eat rice so my word must be life all the time can I continue watching Isaiah 54 no water weapon thank you continue my friend not weapon that is what formed against thee Shadow prosper and every tongue that's how water rise against thee in water judgment you shall do what condemn in other words you cannot keep your mouth quiet this is why when somebody is around me and speaking negative things I cannot keep quiet [Music] one day Jesus was Gone with the disciple and Jesus begin to speak his agenda that you know what I'm going to Jerusalem and what's going to happen they will kill me and they will do this The Prince and this this and Peter not a sinner a disciple a Son of God a predestinated seed God is Spirit on him they therefore God on him so don't expect your trial sometime to come outside do you follow me the brother is not bad he's just a brother may be in weakness and the devil took over him everybody okay because the devil knows how Jesus and pee they love one another can I continue and then as the moving Peter begin to repeat that you know what it's not going to happen to you Jesus didn't say ah I don't want to offend him [Music] Jesus turn around and say Satan not Peter I'm not talking about you Peter Satan the one who's talking right now get deep behind me in other words and I'm doing my thing about my life and my faith with God don't be negative around me because I have to condemn that term I cannot say quiet when I'm saying God will do this you say no I don't think it's going to happen I'll say please hush it will happen because what you're saying is contrary to what God is telling me and anything that goes contrary to the world I will act like it doesn't even exist that's what Abraham did everything that was contrary to the promise of Abraham Abraham never even considered that right and the Bible say every pound that rise against you you condemn it if you want to take the court and somebody want to say something about it tell him they must need it it's over don't stay quiet because it's a seed that the devil is shooting the Bible said that is the heritage it's a Heritage of the servant of the Lord and the righteousness is of me say who the Lord so our heritage is to condemn everything that is contrary to the world [Applause] oh God let me get to the airport brother Branham say we have faith in our heart the faith of God where in our heart and can see how it clear it become water of Faith then we do what to speak it and he comes into what existing the same thing because the mind of Christ Israel in the man that is what makes healing and so forth when you get the perfect revelation just what you're doing then you know how to walk that's it because that is the Christian water walk so when God delivers something you open up your mouth and deliver it and you don't stop at delivering it you begin to act according to it [Applause] let me leave it alone brother Branham say this if you go back you want to go back a little further just as far as historical you could see the word in the beginning was water the world but what is the word he became a word and the word became water material so everything that God has spoke in his word receive in the right channel will materialize that word for whatever the promise behind it is God will do it he is what obligated to water it if he a bad way in me and my word about where in you then you have hope God and the word is where in you and you believe the word just as you believe who God because God it is who God because God it is God and it is what Inseparable then if you have God's word in you you have God's life where in you you have God where in you and whatever God's word speak forth out of you is I have to do what come to pass just like he was speaking from who God amen perfect faith is a master of water all circumstances perfect Faith Master water all circumstances no matter what it is he does what Masters is when you believe anything what do anything and you got faith in what you are doing no matter what the circumstances is they don't have one thing to do with it a master that circumstance amen if it is in the room of sickness and the Lord do whatever revealed that these certain things is going to happen what do you have to do you just speak it and go on faith is not good just to be faithful When Faith come you speak it and you act like it you don't have a baby go buy baby stuff [Applause] [Music] why are you buying baby stuff is your wife pregnant of course God says so [Applause] everybody okay you don't have to think about it you speak it because it's not your word it is the word of God Lord have mercy Pride upon him say so hold the king safe in water the world and every bit of faith that you believe and you don't water that one's bad you can unlock water every door that stand between you and the water blessing of God that God has for water you so the blessing of God that he had for you you have only one lock amen see on that may God help us to have the keys is my prayer he said let us bow our head now for a word of water prayer brother Branham says this I'm gonna I'm gonna stop he said when you receive the inspiration that Jesus Christ did what died for your sickness it is that very hour that your healing has come amen [Applause] let me start it again so you can go home good when you receive that water that Jesus Christ died for your sickness it is that very hour that your healing has water come don't be waiting for the manifestation it's coming later when the Revelation

Gentile doesn't lie in the laying of hate that's why the Roman said to you and say you don't even have to come to my home but if you can speak the word just the word like Peter say at that word that's all I need Peter never stood to check the water to see if there were fishes or not once he received the word yes he took the net and throw it up where did the fish come that's not a mystery that is your responsibility but what happened is when he pulled the net he was even unable to pull it because he was beyond what he was expecting Lord maybe somebody have worked too much and they have not gotten anything maybe they try many thing and it's not working maybe they hope for this and that and it seems like they cannot grasp it that you are still the same God that can roll up a revelation from heaven and drop it into the channel of their soul so that Lord father whatever the need is they can get what they need and be free and as soon as that Revelation struck whatever hormone is not

Revelation so that you can give them their daily bread the bread for the day the bread for the present time and they can also have a seed for the future so that they can testify and whatever they
