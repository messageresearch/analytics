[21:01] actually sat down and actually listened
[21:03] to the words that these next two and
[21:05] mainly just the courses of both of them
[21:08] I realized how powerful lyrics were how
[21:11] powerful the words were in these songs
[21:12] and I see I catch myself all the time
[21:15] just singing these and you know they're
[21:17] really precious to me but oh yes oh yes

[22:20] and Richard how many grateful they're a
[22:44] child of the king he called us more than
[22:48] overcomers and every time I hear that
[22:50] I'm like thank you or die here the prof
[22:52] I heard the prophets say it the other
[22:53] day he called us more than overcomers
[22:55] that's how much confidence he placed in
[22:57] us and he placed us in this age because
[23:00] he knew we would have confidence to
[23:02] withstand and every time I think of that
[23:03] I think Lord forgive me for where I grow
[23:06] cold on you and when I grow slack on you
[23:08] and and kind of put him on the back
[23:09] burner because his love remains faithful
[23:11] to us whether we don't put him in first
[23:13] place he puts us in first place each day
[23:15] so I'm like Lord forgive me for why I
[23:17] don't put you in first place because I
[23:19] believe he deserves first place he knew
[23:24] me yeah

[27:57] all tonight good to see everybody in the
[28:01] house of the Lord when I see everybody I
[28:04] mean those that are here and good to see
[28:06] you also online if you don't mind let's
[28:10] go to Exodus chapter 4 still continuing
[28:19] on the same series I hope my voice is
[28:23] good everybody hear me good praise God
[28:27] Exodus chapter 4 verse 1 as we promised
[28:32] last Sunday we went through the widow
[28:34] who I was it a widow
[28:36] we just describing everything that is in
[28:39] the Ministry of Elijah to make sure
[28:41] everybody can see why do we believe what
[28:45] we believe brother Branham has been so
[28:48] challenged people have attacked the
[28:52] message portraying things like whatever
[28:55] happened in the ministry of brother
[28:56] Branham is not based in the Bible that's
[28:59] why we are taking these to show you that
[29:02] dog in my
[29:04] we call into a different name but there
[29:07] is still a foundation in the Bible every
[29:10] god-given ministry have a foundation in
[29:13] the scripture but David would you have
[29:15] we can move up here please
[29:17] and Moses answered verse one and say
[29:22] thank you appreciate but behold they
[29:27] will not believe me you might be seated
[29:31] so last Sunday we saw that Moses was
[29:35] sent to pull Israel out of Egypt but
[29:39] before Moses goes there the Pharaoh must
[29:42] died we found out that Elijah was sent
[29:45] to take care of the widow but before
[29:49] Elijah was same the husband must be dead
[29:54] and our husband also our faith nature
[29:57] must die and our denomination where we
[30:01] came from must die before we be united
[30:05] to the Word of God but now as we
[30:07] promised we're going to be dealing with
[30:09] the two sons or the three the two pools
[30:12] we need to find them in the scripture
[30:14] why does brother Branham have those
[30:16] pools now when we look here we found out
[30:19] that Moses was given a commission to go
[30:22] rescue Israel we also we always talked
[30:27] how good or great Moses sees how great
[30:30] his ministry is but there was something
[30:32] that happened to Moses here Moses
[30:35] expressed something together he says
[30:37] they will not believe me
[30:39] in other words sending just a messenger
[30:43] or a man was not enough there was still
[30:46] a blockage rady you can send me anybody
[30:50] can claim God send them anybody can
[30:53] claim God spoke to them anybody can
[30:56] claim God have led them to do something
[30:58] but what is the vindication or the
[31:02] confirmation that this is the Lord
[31:04] so Moses was really conscious of that
[31:07] and he said yes I understand I don't
[31:09] have any problem I'll meet with you I'll
[31:11] see you we talk face-to-face I have an
[31:15] experience with you
[31:17] when I go tell Israel that you are the
[31:21] one who sent me the way I know them
[31:23] they're not gonna believe me because
[31:26] first of all when I tried to rescue them
[31:29] and came back again they rejected me so
[31:33] how am I going to go to a people under
[31:35] such a great difficulty slavery being
[31:39] mistreated by their taskmaster and tell
[31:41] them the Lord Jehovah send me they will
[31:45] not believe me especially when people
[31:48] are going through so much trouble it
[31:51] would be reach a point where they don't
[31:54] even believe there is any hope in the
[31:56] world even if you bring them the word of
[31:59] the Lord you say the Lord said this this
[32:00] this they say well let's see if it's
[32:03] going to happen or not so how are the
[32:06] people going to believe me I met you
[32:09] there's no problem but I'm worried about
[32:11] the people so first one and Moses
[32:15] answered and say but behold they will
[32:17] not believe me nor hearken to my voice
[32:20] for they will say the Lord has not
[32:24] appeared to you and the Lord said to him
[32:28] what is that in your hand and he say a
[32:32] rod and he say cast it on the ground and
[32:35] he cast it on the ground and he became a
[32:39] serpent and Moses fled from it we spoke
[32:42] about these in the constellation of the
[32:44] serpent that they may believe that the
[32:49] Lord of sorry verse four and the Lord
[32:51] said to Moses put forth your hand and
[32:53] take it by the tail we explained this
[32:55] before you see how everything is
[32:57] blending praise the Lord
[32:59] instead put a take it by the tail and he
[33:03] put forth his hand and caught it and it
[33:06] became a rod in his hand first five that
[33:09] they may believe that the Lord God of
[33:13] the fire of their fathers the God of
[33:17] Abraham the god of Isaac and the God of
[33:20] Jacob has appeared to you so the son of
[33:24] the road the miracle sana was given to
[33:28] Moses for a purpose
[33:30] the purpose was to make Israel believe
[33:34] that Moses was sent by God
[33:38] so the Fasano is a miracle working God
[33:43] the God of miracle and wonders
[33:47] send Moses with a son of miracle and
[33:51] Wonder and through this the people will
[33:55] believe if you want the people to
[33:57] believe the gospel
[33:58] you must couple the gospel with mark 16
[34:01] they want to see a God in skin everybody
[34:06] clear verse 6 and the Lord say
[34:09] furthermore in other word in addition to
[34:13] this I am adding this why didn't the
[34:16] Lord stop in one son he wanted to add
[34:20] the second why he could have used the
[34:23] miracle and that's sufficient but God
[34:25] said let me add again this furthermore
[34:29] to him put now your hand in your bosom
[34:33] and he put his hand into his bosom we
[34:37] know that it's the right hand we already
[34:39] described that whatever Adam said it was
[34:41] the right hand most of men are
[34:43] right-handed remember the series and he
[34:46] put his hand into his bosom and when he
[34:48] took it out behold his hand was leprous
[34:51] as snow so the hand was beautiful when
[34:55] he went into the heart and when the hand
[34:58] pulled from the heart their hand
[35:01] revealed that which was hidden in the
[35:03] heart oh my god so there is a hand clean
[35:12] good looking good first when the hand
[35:16] goes into contact with the heart their
[35:19] hand came back with feeling that there
[35:23] is leprosy in the heart revealing a
[35:28] disease from the heart and when they
[35:32] hand went back again and came out there
[35:35] was no disease everybody clear so the
[35:40] heart of Moses had a secret
[35:44] is it clear now but the secret of their
[35:49] heart must be revealed that's the second
[35:53] son God gave to Moses the first son
[35:57] miracle wanders the second tab though
[36:01] the second son to reveal the hidden
[36:04] things of the heart
[36:07] are we clear clear praise the Lord and
[36:13] he said put your hand into your bosom
[36:16] again and he put his hand into his bosom
[36:21] again and plug it out of his bosom and
[36:23] behold he was turned again as he's out
[36:26] of flesh verse 7 verse 8 and it shall
[36:30] come to pass if they will not believe
[36:33] you the problem is to believe Moses but
[36:37] what does believe in Moses means the key
[36:40] is not just to believe Moses but to
[36:43] believe that Moses was sent from God the
[36:47] key is clear everybody there and it
[36:50] shall come to pass if they will not
[36:51] believe you neither hearken to your
[36:54] voice to the voice of the first son so
[36:58] this miracle here God called them as son
[37:03] everybody clear
[37:05] so when brother Branham comes with
[37:07] terminology if you don't know it relax
[37:11] that they will believe the voice of the
[37:14] ladder son so this is a son and the
[37:18] second one is a son so Moses had two
[37:21] sons and verse nine and it shall come to
[37:25] pass if they would not believe also
[37:27] these two sons everybody see there so
[37:32] Moses was given two sons so when you see
[37:36] somebody with two sons it is not
[37:39] unscriptural the son are given for a
[37:44] purpose to bring the people to believe
[37:47] the one God sent everybody clear
[37:51] neither hearken to your voice that you
[37:54] shall take off the water of
[37:56] the river and pour it upon the dry land
[37:59] and the water which you shall take out
[38:01] of the river shall become blood upon the
[38:04] dry land now you can take the water out
[38:07] of the river with a container you can go
[38:11] ahead a river you can pull your
[38:13] container pull the water out go to the
[38:15] dry land and pull it out
[38:17] and it's going to turn bland but the
[38:19] result so in that way you can move the
[38:22] water out of the river without human
[38:25] intervention you can move the water out
[38:29] of the river without your hand or your
[38:32] ability being involve into it you can
[38:36] move the water from the river out of the
[38:39] river
[38:39] you can displace the water from one
[38:42] place to another with a different
[38:45] channel and that channel was revered by
[38:48] Jesus Christ Jesus say if you want to
[38:52] speak to dismantle and if you want to
[38:57] displace the mountain from there without
[39:00] using that amount without using atomic
[39:03] bomb you can just speak to the mountain
[39:06] and the mountain will be moving from
[39:09] there and go into a different place so
[39:12] if they don't believe the Tucson I'm
[39:14] going to tell you another secret the
[39:17] other secret is the power of the spoken
[39:21] word so there is a first silent is
[39:25] miracle and wonders the second Sun is
[39:28] the revelation of the hidden part of the
[39:31] heart and the third sana is the power of
[39:35] the spoken word right here from your
[39:38] Bible
[39:39] everybody clear that you shall take the
[39:42] water of the river and pour it on the
[39:44] dry land and the water which you shall
[39:47] take out of the river shall become blood
[39:49] upon the dry land in other word they
[39:52] don't believe this there is this if they
[39:54] don't believe this there is another one
[39:56] right there
[39:57] that you can just pick the word and then
[39:59] the word will go ahead and take care of
[40:01] the things everybody clear now let's go
[40:03] to first Kings chapter 19 to combine
[40:07] this with what we have been
[40:09] dealing with the spirit of Elijah if you
[40:13] dare you can see a man okay
[40:16] few people it's Wednesday so we take it
[40:20] as a Sunday school everybody there first
[40:26] in chapter 19 verse thousand and as he
[40:32] lay and slept under a juniper tree this
[40:35] is Elijah he was tired running away from
[40:38] Jezebel went to a juniper tree and begin
[40:42] to relax behold then an angel touch him
[40:47] which angel is it we don't know yet an
[40:51] angel touched him and said to him arise
[40:54] and eat and he look and behold there was
[41:00] a cake baked on the cold so when Elijah
[41:05] was shaken by this angel the angel told
[41:12] him wake up and eat what he found was a
[41:16] cake and the second thing was water
[41:22] everybody there so the first touch of
[41:26] the angel the first food of the angel
[41:30] unveiled the cake and the water there
[41:36] was a cake big on the call it was fresh
[41:39] baked on a fire and a cruse of water at
[41:44] his hand and he did eat and drink and
[41:47] lay him down again so the first time he
[41:50] was fed by the angel he has an angel
[41:55] food first time Elijah this is before
[41:58] going to Mount Horeb everybody clear
[42:02] ok and verse 7 and the angel of the Lord
[42:07] so now we know who is that angel
[42:10] so that angel is the angel of the Lord
[42:14] so Elijah has two interaction with the
[42:18] angel of the Lord giving him food
[42:23] everybody clear and the angel of the
[42:25] Lord we started with Moses now we are
[42:27] with Elijah remember Moses Elijah Moses
[42:30] Elijah Moses Elijah
[42:32] you remember that now we are with Elijah
[42:34] and the angel of the Lord came again the
[42:38] second time so there is a second coming
[42:41] of the angel everybody there and touch
[42:45] him and say arise and eat because the
[42:48] journey is too great for you and he
[42:51] arose and did eat and drink and went in
[42:54] the strength of damid 40 days and
[42:57] foreigner to Horeb the Mount of God so
[43:01] we found out that the angel awake here
[43:05] woke him twice by feeding him and that
[43:09] angel was the angel of the Lord the
[43:13] angel of the Lord of the Lord so Elijah
[43:19] has to touch from the angel of the Lord
[43:24] and the third one he went to horrible
[43:27] and to him this is where he got an
[43:30] experience which we described similar to
[43:34] sunset mantle everybody there so before
[43:38] Elijah goes to horrible to experience
[43:42] what happen in our day in Sunset
[43:44] Mountain Elijah have a ministry with the
[43:48] angel of the Lord giving him to touch
[43:52] clear let's go to Luke chapter father
[43:56] and then we're going to pray if I just
[44:00] read this and don't build to dislike
[44:02] this somebody will be lost
[44:03] Luke chapter 5 verse 20 if you dare you
[44:08] can say Amen this is Jesus talking when
[44:13] they brought somebody who was sick Jesus
[44:18] say and when he saw their faith the
[44:20] Bible says actually when when he saw
[44:22] their faith he said to him men your sins
[44:26] are forgiven you the man was sick he
[44:30] came to be here
[44:31] but instead of Jesus dealing with him
[44:33] complete
[44:34] and just healing the man and let him go
[44:36] Jesus say ah first of all your sins are
[44:40] forgiven verse 21 and the scribe and the
[44:44] Pharisee begin began to reason saying
[44:48] who is this which speaks blasphemies who
[44:51] can forgive sin but God alone in other
[44:56] word deity can forgive sin
[44:59] so Jesus Christ was telling them right
[45:02] there that I am God verse 22 but when
[45:05] Jesus perceived their thought there is a
[45:08] perception of Tatia he answered he
[45:12] answering said to them what was on you
[45:15] in your heart Jesus begin to perceive
[45:18] what was happening in the heart and what
[45:21] was happening in the heart was not
[45:23] something good it was something bad he
[45:27] was not something pure he was something
[45:30] very bad everybody discernment in the
[45:35] heart whether is it easier to say your
[45:40] sins be forgiven you or to say rise up
[45:44] and work so right here
[45:47] Jesus is I'm falling unfolding the two
[45:50] components of the atonement Jesus is
[45:54] saying that healing somebody is just as
[45:58] much easier for me as forgiving their
[46:02] sin in other word I have the power both
[46:05] to heal somebody and to forgive their
[46:08] sin because the atonement have a dual
[46:12] component the atonement is I am the lord
[46:15] who forgive your sins and will also heal
[46:19] you from all your diseases so the
[46:22] atonement have the healing of the body
[46:24] and he also have the forgiveness of sins
[46:29] everybody clear so which weather is it
[46:34] easier to say your sins be forgiven you
[46:37] or to say rise up and walk
[46:39] but that you may know that the Son of
[46:41] man had power on earth to forgive sins
[46:44] he said to the sick of the palsy
[46:47] say to you arise and take up your catch
[46:49] and go in your house if you can go back
[46:54] to Exodus chapter 4 and then we're going
[46:56] to be praying praise the Lord
[47:00] so everybody got to pre the picture
[47:03] clear and let's take off from the
[47:05] airport Exodus chapter 4 everybody Dave
[47:11] all right let's pray Heavenly Father
[47:14] Lord we thank you for your grace your
[47:16] love your mercy and giving us another
[47:18] opportunity to be gathered together
[47:20] around the revealed Word of the our Lord
[47:23] your prophet and the Bible also spoke to
[47:26] us Lord that were the carcasses that's
[47:29] where the ego should be gathering law
[47:32] father your prophet also stated that
[47:34] Lord a true evil when the people arrive
[47:38] when the people are brought back to the
[47:40] word of the our Lord that's what we are
[47:42] holding Lord and we are committing this
[47:45] service unto the hand may the Holy
[47:47] Spirit may they he sad teacher Lord
[47:49] father may you come and teach a word to
[47:52] your children may you stabilize this
[47:54] church Lord may you heal those that are
[47:56] sick Lord may you answer to the need of
[47:58] the people according to their heart Lord
[48:01] father we claim everything under the
[48:04] blood of the Lamb rebuking every work of
[48:06] the devil and asking all in the name of
[48:09] Jesus Christ amen
[48:11] god bless you want some or once more we
[48:14] are continuing with our topic the
[48:17] unchanging pattern of God Malachi 4 now
[48:21] brother Branham say this I wanted to
[48:23] brought her to bring this back to your
[48:25] attention in their handwriting on the
[48:27] wall he says everything that is on earth
[48:30] today in the way of spiritual things
[48:33] such as the Spirit of God and the Spirit
[48:36] of the devil and all the codes and
[48:38] everything that we have today in the
[48:40] world they began in Genesis in other
[48:44] word there is nothing new Under the Sun
[48:47] Genesis means the beginning and all
[48:50] those things yet under another name and
[48:54] under another form this is very
[48:58] important when I explained to you that
[49:00] if you take John the Baptist you can
[49:03] spend your whole life trying to find the
[49:06] name of John the Baptist in the Old
[49:08] Testament you will never find it you're
[49:10] gonna lose it
[49:11] you're gonna miss God but when Jesus
[49:14] came he look at John the Baptist and he
[49:17] said this is Elijah who was supposed to
[49:19] come so Elijah was John the Baptist but
[49:23] in the time of John the Baptist he was
[49:26] never called a Raja he was called John
[49:29] the Baptist so you must understand that
[49:32] the Spirit does not change but they form
[49:35] that the spirit takes or the name that
[49:38] the spirit Vail into it might change so
[49:42] don't be caught up into the name and
[49:44] turn around and say I don't see that in
[49:47] the scripture because you can chase John
[49:50] you won't find it John even identifying
[49:54] himself by the scripture when they asked
[49:57] him who are you he said go to Isaiah 40
[50:00] go to Malachi 3 so if you don't know the
[50:02] scripture you can miss God easily so
[50:06] what might be called in the Old
[50:08] Testament Elijah in the New Testament
[50:10] that might be called John the Baptist so
[50:13] what might be called in the Old
[50:15] Testament a son in our day is dama
[50:19] become a pool so when they say it's a
[50:24] first pool it's a second pool if you go
[50:27] into the Bible you searcher you will
[50:29] never find it that's why you need to
[50:32] look at the characteristic of what
[50:34] happened in the pool somebody's claiming
[50:38] here having a ministry with the first
[50:40] floor and the second pool before you
[50:43] judge before you criticize before you
[50:46] try to interpret before you try to
[50:48] figure it out make sure you look at the
[50:52] detail they lack of looking at details
[50:55] that's when we miss things over there
[50:58] when arrowed argick law the Pharisee he
[51:02] says come a little bit I'm hearing that
[51:05] the Messiah is born again
[51:07] born here were shoot the Messiah go they
[51:10] have to go into the detail and go back
[51:13] and forth and say ah it should be from
[51:16] Bethlehem why because the prophecies say
[51:19] Bethlehem little city of Judah so if you
[51:22] search a different way you're gonna miss
[51:25] it if you look at the name Jesus Christ
[51:27] in the Old Testament you won't find it
[51:30] you must identify the Messiah by the son
[51:34] when he discerned the woman at the well
[51:37] then the woman said wait a minute
[51:39] I discerned that you are a prophet and
[51:42] what you talking about is in the line of
[51:45] the Messiah and I know that when the
[51:47] Messiah comes he is going to be giving
[51:49] me explanation of the things you're
[51:52] talking about so the name will change
[51:55] the form will change but the unchanging
[52:00] God will never change in his
[52:03] characteristic that's why we need to
[52:06] look right there understand how God
[52:08] operated if you don't you're going to
[52:11] miss it
[52:12] Samuel grew into the temple he grew
[52:16] under the Ministry of Allah the prophet
[52:18] the Bible said he grew up he knew
[52:21] everything about the church but when God
[52:24] called someone somewhere run to Allah
[52:29] that's the problem in the message when
[52:32] God is speaking to somebody we are so
[52:34] caught up into a preacher we are so
[52:37] caught up into a personality and when
[52:40] God is calling Samuel the Bible says the
[52:43] Lord are called him but he goes back and
[52:47] Sarah you coming Eli say I didn't then
[52:52] he goes back the second time and they'll
[52:54] all call him again
[52:55] guess what who went back again to Allah
[52:57] that were your first Pharaoh must die
[53:01] that's why your first husband must die
[53:05] you must be shaken from your first
[53:07] husband from your first pastor you put
[53:11] too much confidence into him so God has
[53:14] to shake him away and the third time
[53:17] when he came same deal I said I perceive
[53:21] something I'm going to teach you
[53:23] something
[53:24] Eli never told Samuel that Samuel you
[53:27] need to follow me Allah gave Samuel the
[53:31] instruction to help
[53:33] Samuel develop his personal relationship
[53:37] with God that's why I am here brother
[53:42] Branham said the purpose of his ministry
[53:45] was not for people to follow him or to
[53:48] start an organization but to join the
[53:51] people into cluster and if that is the
[53:54] purpose of brother Branham I am now
[53:56] going to change from that purpose my
[53:59] purpose in this church is to give you
[54:02] instruction so that you can develop your
[54:05] personal relationship with God when
[54:08] allah when samuel went back to god he
[54:11] never came back over there again when
[54:13] god said hey señor he just gave the
[54:16] instruction and God begins to develop a
[54:19] personal relationship between him and
[54:22] Samuel until dealer came he say the Lord
[54:25] spoke to you something I hide anything
[54:28] from me
[54:28] I want you to start talking to me that's
[54:31] what I want in this church I want God to
[54:34] speak to the sister I want God to speak
[54:37] to the brother
[54:37] I want the nine gift of the Holy Spirit
[54:40] in the church so when we come here
[54:42] brother police telling me brother Steven
[54:45] the Lord spoke to me at four o'clock
[54:47] brother Maurice is telling me the Lord
[54:49] spoke to me at two o'clock brother Ramon
[54:51] is telling me the Lord spoke to me when
[54:54] I was at work since the Brazil is
[54:55] telling me when I was teaching the kid
[54:57] an inspiration struck me because we are
[55:00] in this together
[55:01] the pillar of fire was not for Moses
[55:04] only he wants for all Israel the pillar
[55:07] of fire was not for brother branham only
[55:09] it was for the entire broad the work
[55:13] that I do shall you do
[55:15] so we must get the sufficient
[55:17] instruction to develop a personal
[55:20] relationship with Jesus Christ the devil
[55:24] doesn't care how you worship Him
[55:26] whether you worship Him consciously or
[55:29] unconsciously or in a crazy way he
[55:32] doesn't care as long as you worship Him
[55:34] but God is very meticulous in the
[55:38] approach and the way you worship Him
[55:40] if you don't worship Him the correct way
[55:42] you're gonna miss God
[55:44] everybody clear so far so we want to
[55:47] know what is the characteristic but
[55:50] don't be caught up into the name don't
[55:52] be caught up into the form by the same
[55:54] spirit the beginning Jesus's will brings
[55:57] it out now when God was smoking was
[56:01] talking to Moses Moses gave God his
[56:06] trouble his problem Moses says that how
[56:09] is Israel going to believe me and God
[56:13] gave him three son to help Israel
[56:16] believe Moses then Moses came up again
[56:20] with another excuse he said I have a
[56:24] problem with my speech and when Moses
[56:27] brought that problem he opened up a door
[56:30] to a man that is called Aaron but God
[56:34] knew already who were on was in Exodus
[56:38] chapter 4 when I told you to open in
[56:41] verse 14 if you can read with me the
[56:44] Bible say and the anger of the Lord was
[56:47] kindled against Moses and he said he is
[56:51] not around there
[56:52] livid Aaron was a livid leave up in a
[56:59] scripture leads the minister and I leave
[57:02] that also in the scripture means the
[57:04] bride I will deal with that later on
[57:07] down the road where we're going to talk
[57:09] about the mystery of the stairs when
[57:13] they were carrying the Ark of the
[57:14] Covenant they were carrying that in the
[57:16] stave we need to find out what are those
[57:19] cave are we there then you will
[57:21] understand what is going on with
[57:23] deliverer
[57:24] he said that our Lord delivered your
[57:27] brother
[57:28] and know that he can speak well God
[57:30] already knew so in other word when God
[57:33] was sending Moses he coupled the
[57:37] Ministry of Moses with Aaron are you
[57:42] there so Moses was not the only one
[57:46] prophesied
[57:48] Aaron also was prophesying
[57:51] everybody following me and behold he
[57:55] comes forth to meet you and when he sees
[57:58] you he will be glad in his heart and you
[58:01] shall speak to him watch this carefully
[58:03] and put word in his mouth
[58:07] in other word God on the top is talking
[58:12] to Moses you need to understand this
[58:16] clearly we have God here giving
[58:22] instruction to Moses I did follow this
[58:27] clearly and you shall speak to him and
[58:32] put words in his mouth and I will be
[58:37] with your mouth and with his mouth so
[58:42] the anointing that puts the word on
[58:46] Moses was the same anointing that also
[58:51] put the word on Aaron so the word of
[58:55] losses originally was not Moses words he
[58:59] was the word of God and when he comes to
[59:02] Moses Moses delivered them to Aaron and
[59:04] Aaron are you have to do oath to repeat
[59:12] to repeat what Moses already said Moses
[59:19] cannot say a and Aaron said B if Moses
[59:23] say a Aaron was just a tape just a video
[59:29] just a repetition of Moses and Moses was
[59:35] a repetition of
[59:39] everybody so the god that anoint Moses
[59:44] was the god that anoint Ellen and if you
[59:48] notice Moses and Aaron were brothers
[59:50] Moses and Aaron were livid so leave that
[59:54] Moses was not different than leave at
[59:58] Aaron they were both of the same nature
[1:00:03] they were both of the same caliber they
[1:00:08] were above of the same family but one
[1:00:12] was just a little bit higher as the
[1:00:15] Prophet everybody clear
[1:00:17] and we'll teach you what you should do
[1:00:22] verse 16 and he shall be your Stockman
[1:00:27] so Aaron is the spokesman of Moses he
[1:00:32] shall be of spokeman to the people and
[1:00:34] he shall be even he shall be to you
[1:00:37] instead of a mouth and you shall be to
[1:00:40] him instead of God so when Moses
[1:00:43] presented himself
[1:00:45] Moses become God to the people everyone
[1:00:50] become a prophet to the people prophet
[1:00:53] under Moses this God was not to be
[1:00:57] worship but he was God as far as giving
[1:01:00] the message or destruction everybody
[1:01:03] clear now when Aaron prop up in Muharram
[1:01:08] if you notice down the road you found
[1:01:11] out that both of them met at the
[1:01:12] mountain of God then we found that there
[1:01:16] is something about Aaron that is a
[1:01:19] little bit tricky ruddy Aaron here is a
[1:01:23] Levite just like Moses Moses is the
[1:01:27] prophet of the hour and he have to give
[1:01:30] his message to Aaron which is a livid a
[1:01:33] type of the brother you say brother
[1:01:36] Stephen Aaron is a man how can a man be
[1:01:39] a brother a broad must be a woman if you
[1:01:43] go to the Book of Jonah you found out
[1:01:45] that in the book of Revelation John was
[1:01:47] a man and he represented the
[1:01:51] are we there if you go back you find
[1:01:55] that some son was a man and Sam son
[1:01:58] represented the church but one preached
[1:02:01] a message and deceived church by the
[1:02:03] world and he tapped Sam son as a church
[1:02:07] when Esau was meeting with Jacob brother
[1:02:11] Branham said Esau was a top of the
[1:02:13] Catholic Church brother Branham said the
[1:02:16] Benjamin was a top of the 144,000 and
[1:02:20] brother Branham also said that Jacob was
[1:02:23] a top of 124 and 44,000 so you need to
[1:02:27] understand how these things work so
[1:02:30] Aaron was a top of the brother and his
[1:02:34] ministry was to repeat what Moses spoke
[1:02:38] are you there but did you know that
[1:02:41] Aaron and Moses have the three years
[1:02:43] difference did you know that let's go to
[1:02:50] Exodus chapter 7 if you dare you can say
[1:02:56] Amen you there you can say a man please
[1:03:00] and the Lord said to Moses see I have
[1:03:03] made you a god to Pharaoh and Aaron your
[1:03:07] brother shall be a prophet
[1:03:09] God can't be sending are you there God
[1:03:14] coming down when God comes down the
[1:03:18] Prophet ministry also come down the
[1:03:21] prophet ministry was there when God came
[1:03:23] down on the Prophet level the prophetic
[1:03:26] anointing job into Aaron's level either
[1:03:30] okay you shall speak all that I commend
[1:03:35] you and Aaron your brother shall speak
[1:03:37] to Pharaoh that he sent the children of
[1:03:42] Israel out of his land verse 7 if you
[1:03:45] dare you can say Amen and Moses was four
[1:03:49] score years old which means every years
[1:03:53] old
[1:03:53] everybody know that so Moses was 80
[1:03:56] years old everybody clear and Aaron's
[1:04:00] four score and
[1:04:02] three years which is what 83 years are
[1:04:07] you there
[1:04:07] so this church was born before the
[1:04:12] messenger when Aaron was born it took
[1:04:19] three years then Moses was born are you
[1:04:23] clear
[1:04:24] now odysseus started in 1906 and in 1909
[1:04:29] three years brother branham was born are
[1:04:36] we clear we clear
[1:04:39] is it clear the bubble so we found three
[1:04:42] people there we found the angel of the
[1:04:44] Lord
[1:04:45] we found Moses who's the prophet and we
[1:04:48] find Aaron who is the top of the brother
[1:04:50] and if you go back to Revelation chapter
[1:04:53] 10 you will find that there is a Mahdi
[1:04:56] angel that comes down which is Christ
[1:04:58] and you'll find that if there is the
[1:05:00] seventh angel who is Moses a prophet are
[1:05:05] you there and you gotta find John who is
[1:05:07] also a top of the brother and the first
[1:05:11] time in Revelation 10 7 the Bible said
[1:05:14] at the voice of the seventh angel when
[1:05:17] he shall begin to sound so the first
[1:05:20] sermon have to be preached by the seven
[1:05:23] angel but in Revelation 8 the Bible said
[1:05:27] to John take the book and eat and you
[1:05:29] must also prophesy just like Aaron
[1:05:33] Professor Moses also prophesied John
[1:05:37] also prophesied everybody clear
[1:05:40] but what is the purpose of these pools
[1:05:43] let's go back to Exodus chapter 4 verse
[1:05:48] 30 if you dare you can say Amen verse 30
[1:05:55] everybody there and Aaron spoke all the
[1:05:58] words which the Lord had spoken to Moses
[1:06:01] indeed the son in the sight of the
[1:06:06] people God gave Moses the son when they
[1:06:10] went and gathered the elder of Israel
[1:06:12] the
[1:06:13] did they perform the sun's first in
[1:06:16] order to gain the credibility or the
[1:06:19] trust of Israel are you there
[1:06:22] verse 31 and the people believed
[1:06:26] everybody here the people believed after
[1:06:29] those side were performed so when they
[1:06:33] got to the elder they took the road put
[1:06:35] it on the ground turn up to a serpent
[1:06:37] put it back up Moses took his hand put
[1:06:40] it on ISA pull it back up and say the
[1:06:43] Lord God met me when he says that clear
[1:06:47] no problem and when God the angel of the
[1:06:50] Lord met Moses in the pillar of fire
[1:06:54] he was secret but to be brought to the
[1:06:57] public Moses needed to son to be
[1:07:01] expressive in order to break the people
[1:07:04] believed him when the angel of the Lord
[1:07:07] met brother branham he was private but
[1:07:10] brother branham must have two son in his
[1:07:13] ministry in order to make people to
[1:07:16] believe him we are dealing with the
[1:07:19] first and the second pole those three
[1:07:23] are line up the Prophet the bride and
[1:07:28] the spirit ought we must say the same
[1:07:31] thing either what a random say here that
[1:07:35] those who receive the prophet in his own
[1:07:39] name will receive the beneficent effect
[1:07:42] of the prophet's ministry and they die
[1:07:47] he him will be blessed and become part
[1:07:51] of the broad of the last day there were
[1:07:54] many people that are hearing the Prophet
[1:07:57] but that are not part of the brother
[1:08:01] that's why the Bible keeps saying to him
[1:08:04] they have a here that's a spiritual ear
[1:08:08] the spiritual ear is a resolution which
[1:08:12] gives the new birth we have so many
[1:08:16] people in the message forty years two
[1:08:19] years five years they don't even know
[1:08:22] how to deal with this ministry
[1:08:24] are you there who mentioned in
[1:08:27] revelation 22:17 their spirit and a
[1:08:31] broad God an errand both of them are
[1:08:36] saying come God Christ and John both of
[1:08:41] them are saying come the god of Moses
[1:08:45] was the god of Aaron the god of brother
[1:08:48] branham is the god of the brother
[1:08:51] are we there now he said here yes listen
[1:08:56] to their authenticated prophet of God
[1:08:58] who appear in this Lesage what he says
[1:09:02] from God there Brad will say that's why
[1:09:07] when we bring the coat when you live in
[1:09:11] brother Branham you must be able to
[1:09:13] humble your wheel toward the Prophet
[1:09:16] chain it is amazing how we can bring
[1:09:19] somebody the word and still they are
[1:09:22] resisting the word because they want to
[1:09:24] go their own way they only accept the
[1:09:27] coat when they caught much their agenda
[1:09:29] but we are not here for our agenda we
[1:09:33] are here for the word of God when they
[1:09:35] bring you the world whether it pleases
[1:09:37] you or not we need to bow down before
[1:09:40] the Word of God
[1:09:40] are we there we want to be trained away
[1:09:44] what he says from God the bride will say
[1:09:48] they spirit and the Prophet and the
[1:09:51] bride will be saying the same thing
[1:09:55] that's why the instruction from God get
[1:09:58] to Moses and the instruction when you
[1:10:01] get to Moses he doesn't change he get
[1:10:04] the same instruction to Aaron and wider
[1:10:07] God the prophet and the brand they are
[1:10:11] all lined up God Christ the seven angel
[1:10:16] brother branham and abroad always say
[1:10:19] the same thing if we don't say the same
[1:10:22] thing you are out of the line and the
[1:10:25] voice of the prophets will say get back
[1:10:27] to line the spirit and the prophet and
[1:10:31] the blood will be saying the same thing
[1:10:33] and what they will say
[1:10:35] we'll have already been in the so it's
[1:10:41] not something new if you have not found
[1:10:44] it to eat the bubble yet maybe the Holy
[1:10:46] Spirit have not quickened that to you
[1:10:48] yet it is hidden somewhere in a way to
[1:10:51] personally until God send a ministry
[1:10:54] that will enlighten you now when we look
[1:10:56] at these Tucson the miracle science of
[1:10:59] the rod and the Sun in the hand that
[1:11:02] went in and pull em proceeded we are
[1:11:05] dealing with the two signs or the two
[1:11:07] pole
[1:11:08] I told you don't be caught up into the
[1:11:10] terminology by you look at the
[1:11:13] characteristic everybody clear now why
[1:11:16] these two sons God is sending Moses to
[1:11:20] Israel but Elmo Moses say I have a
[1:11:23] problem these people won't believe me
[1:11:24] God say I'm going to give you two son
[1:11:27] why why did Moses say people won't
[1:11:29] believe me
[1:11:30] what about them say God does not fall
[1:11:34] upon denominations God does not fall
[1:11:39] upon mechanical devices God the Holy
[1:11:43] Spirit fell upon men man is God's agent
[1:11:49] and the hardest thinks that God has ever
[1:11:53] had to do was to get one mortal to
[1:11:57] believe another that's what Moses said
[1:12:02] they won't believe me we grew up
[1:12:05] together we were brothers and sister and
[1:12:08] you turn around and you say you're a
[1:12:10] prophet get out of here
[1:12:12] I know we were born before you and
[1:12:16] Joseph here you are growing up and you
[1:12:19] come up with dreams with spiritual thing
[1:12:21] where I hear you matter of fact you were
[1:12:25] born out of wedlock we know your story
[1:12:28] that Mary got pregnant before he was
[1:12:31] even married and you come you telling us
[1:12:33] that you are the Messiah
[1:12:35] get out here until Jesus a prophet in
[1:12:38] his
[1:12:39] one country is not well honored why it
[1:12:42] is difficult for a man to believe
[1:12:45] another man you might be at work with
[1:12:48] your coworker your body you're on the
[1:12:51] same job doing the same thing probably
[1:12:53] getting paid the same salary but the day
[1:12:56] they will bring you or take you to the
[1:12:59] office and say from here on you are the
[1:13:02] supervisor that's what you know what
[1:13:07] happen it would be hard for your friend
[1:13:09] to take you as a supervisor are you
[1:13:13] there
[1:13:14] it would take your time until he catch
[1:13:16] up and understanding that's why man it
[1:13:20] is the hardest things God have to do is
[1:13:23] to get one more toe to believe one motor
[1:13:25] Moses was there their new Moses they
[1:13:28] understood Moses they knew even the
[1:13:31] weakness of Moses that Moses killed
[1:13:34] somebody and hide him were there how can
[1:13:37] you take someone like that and bring him
[1:13:39] back to Israel and say Israel the Lord
[1:13:42] spoke to me Moses said with my
[1:13:44] background with everything I deal with
[1:13:46] everything they know about me with
[1:13:48] everything they know about my ministry
[1:13:50] there is no way I can qualify to talk to
[1:13:53] these people why because it's difficult
[1:13:56] for one man to believe another do you
[1:13:58] believe that amen
[1:14:01] they could not believe Moses and God
[1:14:03] give him two sons we are dealing with
[1:14:06] two sons as we promised to prove to the
[1:14:10] people that he was sent from God for
[1:14:14] their deliverance
[1:14:15] it's Babel it's the profit line up
[1:14:18] correctly you believe that well even he
[1:14:22] the same yesterday today and forever the
[1:14:26] unchanging part of God brother Branham
[1:14:30] is telling you if in the Old Testament
[1:14:33] he did that by giving two sons to
[1:14:37] somebody to bring a girl to believe him
[1:14:40] don't you think he's still doing the
[1:14:42] same thing today he did it in the
[1:14:45] Ministry of Jesus Christ he
[1:14:47] Jesus the first pool and the second pool
[1:14:50] and the third pool do you think he can
[1:14:53] do it again today but based on the
[1:14:55] unchanging pattern of God God does not
[1:14:59] change don't be caught up in the name
[1:15:01] don't be caught up in the form but look
[1:15:03] at the characteristic of the ministry
[1:15:06] but a Branham continued he said do you
[1:15:08] believe now he went back to the angel
[1:15:10] the angel that talked to him in a
[1:15:14] burning bush he's the angel of the
[1:15:16] Covenant and what about him said that
[1:15:18] angel is Christ
[1:15:19] we know that I have plenty of coats work
[1:15:22] was that right all right he's the same
[1:15:25] yesterday today and forever in other
[1:15:28] word God does not change he is here now
[1:15:32] in other word will happen in law system
[1:15:37] is here are you there okay and he does
[1:15:42] the same thing today that he did them he
[1:15:47] still perform wonders and son did you
[1:15:51] see that wonders and son he is a
[1:15:56] miraculous God and he's always worked in
[1:16:00] miraculous way with sons and wondered
[1:16:04] and he promised them in this last day
[1:16:08] and we are living in the last day we got
[1:16:13] a right to expect them now to bring his
[1:16:17] people together the Jewish were trained
[1:16:21] to wait on the messiah the samaritan
[1:16:24] were trained to wait on us am I on the
[1:16:27] on a messiah until even a prostitute
[1:16:31] no she have to wait on a messiah but the
[1:16:34] Gentile were not trained to wait on the
[1:16:37] messiah
[1:16:38] now we got to be trained by brother
[1:16:40] branham that there is a promise for you
[1:16:43] that god the unchanging God will be
[1:16:46] expressing himself to the Gentile in the
[1:16:49] last day but when he comes to the gentle
[1:16:52] in the last day it is your
[1:16:53] to expect him to do the same thing he
[1:16:56] did in the Old Testament because Jesus
[1:16:59] Christ is the same yesterday today and
[1:17:02] forever God does not change
[1:17:05] everybody clear as we continue to build
[1:17:08] up what about him say he says do not
[1:17:13] feel when that voice spoke I knew it
[1:17:15] I knew he was the same one he looked at
[1:17:18] me his eyes look upon me kindly not to
[1:17:22] look sympathizing with this angel say do
[1:17:25] not feel say I am sent from the presence
[1:17:27] of God to tell you that to were born a
[1:17:30] peculiar birth and your packet and and
[1:17:33] your peculiar life has been to indicate
[1:17:36] that you are take that you are to take
[1:17:39] the gift of divine healing so brother
[1:17:43] Branham was born with a gift of divine
[1:17:45] healing but we are dealing with the two
[1:17:47] sons either to the people of the world I
[1:17:52] say sir I am uneducated hakuna go he
[1:17:57] said if you shall get them to believe
[1:18:01] you the problem is to believe are you
[1:18:04] there
[1:18:05] so when they tell you you guys are
[1:18:07] talking about third pool first pool
[1:18:09] where is that in the Bible I am bringing
[1:18:11] that down are you there to believe you
[1:18:14] and if you are sincere when you pray
[1:18:17] nothing shall stand before your prayer
[1:18:19] if you get them to believe you and I say
[1:18:24] I bet they would not believe me sir
[1:18:28] history repeat itself
[1:18:31] are you deaf he said you shall be given
[1:18:35] true science as the prophet Moses was
[1:18:40] given to son to get the people to
[1:18:44] believe you is that really the issue so
[1:18:50] the problem was his head is the problem
[1:18:53] rather Branham was concern about it
[1:18:54] because it's hard for one mortal to
[1:18:58] believe in a D'Amato
[1:18:59] especially when the ministries
[1:19:01] great are we there he said one of them
[1:19:06] was detecting disease just by holding
[1:19:08] the person like him in your left
[1:19:11] Moses hand was the right one brother
[1:19:14] branham was left okay
[1:19:17] the near future business here he shall
[1:19:20] come to pass that you shall tell the
[1:19:23] very secret of the heart we were going
[1:19:30] slowly until the picture comes up and
[1:19:35] the things that they were doing wrong to
[1:19:39] do what what is the purpose of the Sun
[1:19:42] to build the faith in the people to be
[1:19:47] in faith and to vindicate you that I God
[1:19:52] will send it to you it's to van de Kate
[1:19:56] you that what Moses is saying is coming
[1:19:59] from God are we clear all right minister
[1:20:05] explain what a Branham say me go right
[1:20:10] here how could I go to face the people
[1:20:12] of the world to take that gift he said I
[1:20:16] will be with you I said they will not
[1:20:19] believe me that's the problem he said
[1:20:22] you'll be given two sons
[1:20:25] now remember sons does not here the
[1:20:31] purpose is to bring the people to
[1:20:36] believe you sons Basner hill the Sun
[1:20:40] rose faith to hear but only through
[1:20:45] faith is he here do you understand son
[1:20:49] only work faith trust credibility the
[1:20:55] angel of the Lord and he performed those
[1:20:59] sons one time and that is what war and
[1:21:02] that Devils all he did it Israel believe
[1:21:07] from then on believe Moses and follow
[1:21:10] the leader why this son is
[1:21:13] not for you to follow me my purpose not
[1:21:18] for you to follow me not to follow me
[1:21:21] but to follow what I tell you that's why
[1:21:25] we must be obedient to the message of
[1:21:29] the hour we must follow the instruction
[1:21:33] of God from our losses brother Branham
[1:21:36] was heat cross the Sun and the Sun are
[1:21:42] vindicated
[1:21:43] whatever he speak follow and the Sun is
[1:21:49] that that you are to follow the Lord
[1:21:55] Moses go to Egypt
[1:21:57] bring the people unto myself we saw that
[1:22:02] you see bring them to God the Lord Jesus
[1:22:06] Christ the Holy Spirit will lead you so
[1:22:10] we understand the purpose of these sons
[1:22:14] the reason that you hear me say
[1:22:16] sometimes get the people get the people
[1:22:20] say believe me see now the reason I say
[1:22:24] that is not to believe me as him is not
[1:22:30] to believe that Moses easy or God are
[1:22:35] you there now certainly not certainly is
[1:22:42] to believe that I have told you the
[1:22:46] truth that he has sent me to do this to
[1:22:52] believe that your messenger was sent
[1:22:55] from God to bring you out of something
[1:22:59] now see when that angel met me he said
[1:23:03] if you get the people to believe you
[1:23:06] believe you as what as God's servant
[1:23:09] anointed for that age and if you believe
[1:23:13] that you must follow what destruction
[1:23:16] everybody clear now when we look at
[1:23:19] these two sons we find there is a son of
[1:23:22] miracle and wonders
[1:23:24] and we found that there is a second Sun
[1:23:26] here which is the Sun of diseases but we
[1:23:30] spoke that in the atonement it's a dual
[1:23:33] Suns either the atonement deal with the
[1:23:38] forgiveness of sin and he also deal with
[1:23:40] the healing of the body and we found out
[1:23:43] that the two science of losses was
[1:23:46] bundled up under the atonement let's go
[1:23:52] slowly sickness is an attribute of
[1:23:56] sinner before we had anything we had no
[1:23:59] sickness sin came and sickness followed
[1:24:03] him as an attribute of see any sickness
[1:24:07] may not you've seen it either or a
[1:24:11] direct or indirect direct you did it
[1:24:14] yourself
[1:24:15] indirect may be a great great great
[1:24:17] father did something and that curse keep
[1:24:20] coming down either he may he may you
[1:24:24] inherited somewhere the weakness of your
[1:24:27] people who sing it's dropping down as he
[1:24:31] said each generation getting weaker and
[1:24:34] wiser but it's either direct or indirect
[1:24:36] calls from sin so somebody seen someone
[1:24:39] for instance like this if a big serpent
[1:24:42] was here or Ebay or a great big
[1:24:45] something that had me by the side with
[1:24:47] his power I explained this before and
[1:24:49] was hurting me with his part now it's
[1:24:52] not necessary for me to have to cut the
[1:24:54] animal pie off because he's still alive
[1:24:57] but if something hits him in the head
[1:24:59] and kills him that kills him all over
[1:25:03] and when Jesus atone for sin he kills
[1:25:07] him and every one of its attribute he
[1:25:10] killed the serpent from its head so that
[1:25:14] serpent that Moses was permitted to
[1:25:18] touch by detail by the attribute because
[1:25:21] the law was dealing with the attribute I
[1:25:24] explained this before was already
[1:25:26] speaking about the atonement coming he
[1:25:29] said Moses you are not the one to bring
[1:25:32] Redemption they will be war
[1:25:34] who's gonna bring Redemption that one
[1:25:36] will be the one crushing the head of the
[1:25:38] serpent because in the Garden of Eden a
[1:25:41] promise was given that your seed will
[1:25:44] Bruce is here but he will crush your
[1:25:46] head everybody clear
[1:25:49] so the atonement had already the first
[1:25:53] son of Moses into it everybody clear
[1:25:57] let's continue why are you going with
[1:26:00] the atonement now because Jesus say
[1:26:03] which one is easier sin forgiven living
[1:26:07] holding the right hand over his heart
[1:26:10] standing like this talking about Moses
[1:26:12] we spoke about the serpent now we're
[1:26:15] talking about the second son here the
[1:26:17] hand where the hidden secret of
[1:26:19] redemption had been healed since the
[1:26:21] foundation of the world
[1:26:23] watch him pulled from his body from his
[1:26:26] bosom bosom his right hand smitten with
[1:26:30] deadly proceed show what God will do
[1:26:34] with his right hand I'm on a job here
[1:26:37] leprosy symbolizes sin and incurable and
[1:26:42] especially in its last stage we're going
[1:26:47] we're talking about the atonement that
[1:26:50] the secret same sermon had been in God's
[1:26:53] bosom all these years covered by the
[1:26:56] right hand who Jesus so the first time
[1:26:59] brother Branham incorporated those two
[1:27:01] sons he's incorporating those son under
[1:27:04] the atonement in other word those son
[1:27:08] are included in the atonement right so
[1:27:13] when Moses is going
[1:27:14] God does not give him two sons by any
[1:27:18] chance God knew that the atonement has
[1:27:22] to go for his children and he gave the
[1:27:26] top of the atonement by the Serpent and
[1:27:28] also by the hand showing that Christ
[1:27:32] will crush him and not only will he will
[1:27:35] cross it he will also bring the
[1:27:37] atonement to
[1:27:38] clean the heart of a man are you there
[1:27:43] whatever Adam say as there are 53 he was
[1:27:47] wounded for our transgressions bruised
[1:27:50] for our iniquity chastisement of our
[1:27:52] peace was upon him with his trap we are
[1:27:54] here healing and forgiveness of sin the
[1:27:58] secret of God's healing lead in the
[1:28:00] bosom of Jesus are you there everybody
[1:28:05] or God he was the right hand of God that
[1:28:09] is the only shift I have in the bosom
[1:28:12] the secret so those two sons that God
[1:28:16] gave Moses which we call today the first
[1:28:19] and the second pool are science that
[1:28:23] component of the atonement when the
[1:28:26] atonement comes to ask you somebody from
[1:28:30] somewhere God put those two sons because
[1:28:33] God is perfected in three there are
[1:28:36] three Exodus the first one Moses did it
[1:28:38] God loaded that atonement the second
[1:28:42] time Jesus came which is the second
[1:28:44] Exodus God loaded o son but the earth
[1:28:47] another third Exodus for the gentle so
[1:28:50] God have to learn those to Sol because
[1:28:53] Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today
[1:28:56] and forever God does not change
[1:28:59] everybody clear
[1:29:01] now let's get to those sign themselves
[1:29:03] the facade he said throw it on the
[1:29:07] ground brother branham and he threw it
[1:29:09] down and when he did it turned to a
[1:29:12] serpent he picked it up by the tail now
[1:29:15] it's no more the atonement the Sun
[1:29:16] itself he turned back to a road again
[1:29:19] and God showed Moses that what could
[1:29:22] what he could do that he was still the
[1:29:25] Living God he could tap the natural and
[1:29:28] change it into supernatural he could do
[1:29:31] whatever he wanted to because he was God
[1:29:35] the God worked in miracle and wonders
[1:29:39] let's go now to the son amen
[1:29:43] thank your hand put it in your bosom he
[1:29:47] did over his heart
[1:29:49] pull it up he was white with
[1:29:52] leprosy white see it means the conscious
[1:29:56] of length the heart of men is white with
[1:30:00] leprosy the very thought of his mind is
[1:30:06] leprosy sin so the first son in brother
[1:30:10] branham ministry will be a sign of
[1:30:13] healing that's why brother Branham is
[1:30:15] born with a gift of healing and when
[1:30:18] brother Branham starting with his first
[1:30:20] pool it is more miracle and wonders are
[1:30:24] you there but on the second son of God a
[1:30:27] Branham it's going to be a son of
[1:30:30] discernment to discern the heart of the
[1:30:32] people and pull the secret of the
[1:30:35] healing out you come for healing the
[1:30:38] prank there is no son no no no healing
[1:30:41] they pray there is no healing you need
[1:30:43] the second pool and when the second pool
[1:30:45] plug in he's going to look and say hey
[1:30:48] the reason why you don't get heal are
[1:30:51] you there the hand is put in your heart
[1:30:53] and when they pull their hand out they
[1:30:56] said the reason why you don't get here
[1:30:58] in 1900 and so you committed adultery
[1:31:02] and you never repented to your wife go
[1:31:05] ahead and repent and that was it and
[1:31:08] when somebody repented they put the hand
[1:31:10] back off come up clean then brother
[1:31:13] Branham say God there is no devil in
[1:31:15] hell that can withstand your healing why
[1:31:19] God wanted to heal his people he healed
[1:31:22] by the first son he knew by the first
[1:31:25] pool or he healed by the second son that
[1:31:27] helped dig into the people hurt to pull
[1:31:30] the sin atoned for the same then Israel
[1:31:34] but those two sons had to bring you to
[1:31:36] believe the messenger everybody here as
[1:31:42] we continue now when we talk about
[1:31:44] healing with Elijah
[1:31:46] we thought that Elijah was fed by the
[1:31:49] crow and he was fed with bread and flesh
[1:31:52] we explained to you what bread was by
[1:31:55] the scripture he was the healing now
[1:31:57] when we talk about healing itself
[1:31:59] we know that bread and flesh have to be
[1:32:01] combined
[1:32:03] because the first in first Thessalonians
[1:32:05] chapter 1 verse file the Bible say that
[1:32:07] the gospel should not be preached by
[1:32:09] word only but by power and what
[1:32:12] demonstration
[1:32:13] you must have bread and flesh everybody
[1:32:17] clear
[1:32:17] now when we talk about healing how does
[1:32:20] healing express itself Healing expressed
[1:32:24] in two ways
[1:32:25] I'm going slowly the first is what we
[1:32:30] call miracle I'm digging this so we
[1:32:33] understand clearly miracle means a
[1:32:36] person work here on the wheelchair you
[1:32:39] pray for that person right now the
[1:32:42] person rise up and begin to walk or a
[1:32:44] person have crutches they pray for that
[1:32:47] person right now and the person through
[1:32:49] the crutches away and go miracle doesn't
[1:32:52] take time everybody here but there is a
[1:32:55] second part of healing there work he
[1:32:58] worked by the casting of of devils you
[1:33:02] first cast out the devil but the person
[1:33:05] is still looking sick I then then after
[1:33:11] a while the healing catch up with that
[1:33:13] person and the person get healed that is
[1:33:16] called
[1:33:16] divine healing that's the reason why
[1:33:20] when Jesus was passing through the fig
[1:33:23] tree he spoke the word and when Jesus
[1:33:26] spoke the word the word struck the tree
[1:33:29] but the tree was still there looking
[1:33:32] right it took the next day for Peter to
[1:33:35] say hey wait a minute
[1:33:37] yesterday you spoke but today the tree
[1:33:40] is withered that is the son of divine
[1:33:44] healing the demon goes first but the
[1:33:47] symptoms are still there and you need to
[1:33:50] hold on to faith because the body need
[1:33:53] to cleanse itself and we move the
[1:33:55] symptom so they can pray for you here
[1:33:58] they keistered ever nothing happened
[1:34:00] after two months you get pregnant
[1:34:03] everybody here now in Matthew 7 verse 22
[1:34:08] 23 you can look at this at home Jesus
[1:34:12] say that
[1:34:13] he shall come on to me you remember that
[1:34:17] we said Lord Lord have we not family yet
[1:34:20] Lord Lord have we not what cast out
[1:34:26] Devils do more miracle in your name are
[1:34:29] you there they say that but they never
[1:34:32] spoke about preaching Gordon remember
[1:34:37] they never said it up they said have we
[1:34:40] not prophesied on him
[1:34:42] have we not cast out their fall in your
[1:34:45] name have we not do many miracle in your
[1:34:48] name are you there
[1:34:50] let's look at that and I'm gonna stop
[1:34:53] here notice the very day when this
[1:34:57] messenger not when he start on but when
[1:35:00] he begins to declare his message see the
[1:35:03] first pool is what healing second pool
[1:35:10] of a sign then put the opening of the
[1:35:14] the ministry revealed the opening of the
[1:35:17] world no more there is no more higher
[1:35:20] order to reveal the word than profit but
[1:35:23] the only way the profit can be
[1:35:24] vindicated is by the world remember the
[1:35:27] third pool was the opening of them seven
[1:35:29] sealed to reveal the hidden truth that
[1:35:32] has been read in the world first pool is
[1:35:34] worth healing second pool is worth
[1:35:36] professed sighing so right here when
[1:35:40] Jesus was talking about the workers of
[1:35:43] iniquity Jesus was telling you that the
[1:35:46] first and the second pool can be
[1:35:49] impersonated we clear
[1:35:56] have we not cast a devil have we not do
[1:36:00] miracle in your name have we not
[1:36:02] prophesy in your name that's why the
[1:36:04] first and the second pools impersonated
[1:36:08] are you there but the third pool is the
[1:36:11] opening of the word but if you look at
[1:36:15] the third pool
[1:36:16] what is the turn pool I'm gonna stop
[1:36:18] here the second please perfection the
[1:36:21] second pool was discernment of the
[1:36:24] spirit they deserve they found out your
[1:36:27] sin pull it out and clean it their
[1:36:29] prophecy France was the healing of the
[1:36:32] sick
[1:36:32] the second was prophecy that went forth
[1:36:35] and he know the secret of the thought
[1:36:37] when the word itself was made manifest
[1:36:40] which that's grace the seven is the
[1:36:43] finish could this be the finished pool
[1:36:46] what about I'm called that the finished
[1:36:47] pool now I'm going to drop here and I'm
[1:36:50] now going to get there because it's too
[1:36:52] deep now but let me go straight to the
[1:36:54] third pool there is no more ministry
[1:36:57] there is more to the ministry than
[1:36:59] divine healing the sick as body our know
[1:37:02] of tonight is the so-called body of
[1:37:05] Jesus Christ in each burrito hearing and
[1:37:08] the OSI and there is only one bomb that
[1:37:11] I know that will hear and that is the
[1:37:13] word so the first is the healing by
[1:37:16] miracle or by casting our devil which is
[1:37:19] the first pool the second pool is the
[1:37:22] prophesy God discern discernment of the
[1:37:26] heart and provide you a healing but they
[1:37:29] turn pool is the healing by the world
[1:37:32] that's why from chapter 107 verse 20 the
[1:37:37] Bible say ascend my word and my word
[1:37:40] heal them
[1:37:42] you can get healing under the first pool
[1:37:44] under the second pool or under the third
[1:37:47] pool are you there
[1:37:50] both of them are bundle up until under
[1:37:53] the atonement they therefore can
[1:37:55] impersonate these two but never this
[1:37:57] down the road are we going to continue
[1:37:59] to see how does those pool interact and
[1:38:03] we're going to see those pool in the
[1:38:05] life of Elijah
[1:38:06] are we there let's pray because our time
[1:38:09] is over
[1:38:10] Heavenly Father Lord we thank you again
[1:38:13] for your grace for your love and for
[1:38:15] your mercy father thank you for bringing
[1:38:18] this stuff clear unto us Lord it took an
[1:38:22] hour of such a shaky load to bring this
[1:38:25] revelation out Lord it is overwhelming
[1:38:28] to me it is overwhelming to your
[1:38:30] show the Lord but is your grace opening
[1:38:33] their eyes so we can see clearly and
[1:38:35] where we were been struggling or where
[1:38:38] we have doubt or where we wonder or
[1:38:41] where doubt was they inserted somewhere
[1:38:44] these doubt can clear that the fog can
[1:38:47] be taken away completely and we can see
[1:38:50] you face to face not again through a
[1:38:52] glass but we can see you face to face
[1:38:54] because we want to kiss our husband they
[1:38:57] reveal word of the our Father we thank
[1:38:59] you again for this service tonight we
[1:39:02] ask you lord father that's the Holy
[1:39:03] Spirit continued to minister to your
[1:39:05] children Lord and as the week go by
[1:39:07] father may you consecrate our heart may
[1:39:10] you keep us close again more closer unto
[1:39:13] the Lord to prepare ourselves for the
[1:39:16] Sunday service Lord if you tarry to come
[1:39:18] Lord prepare our heart every day so that
[1:39:21] whenever you can come father we can be
[1:39:23] ready to meet you in the air father we
[1:39:26] thank you for everything
[1:39:27] committing ourself and to the hand in
[1:39:29] the name of Jesus Christ amen
[1:39:32] god bless you church we love you brought
[1:39:35] a bow
[1:39:57] and forgive me I try not to make a habit
[1:40:00] of getting up and talking after the
[1:40:02] pretty sure I like to just sing a song
[1:40:04] dismiss I know we got to get out of here
[1:40:05] and then everybody's probably ready to
[1:40:07] go home no one's here to hear me I know
[1:40:09] that but God put this on my heart so I
[1:40:11] have to say it I just watch how God has
[1:40:15] led me over the years it's just a
[1:40:17] testimony of what God's done for me I
[1:40:20] first came up here to to visit my my
[1:40:25] wife and we recording and and I moved up
[1:40:27] this way to get to know her better
[1:40:28] because I want to like marry her without
[1:40:30] really getting to know her so I moved up
[1:40:31] this way and I watched God how he
[1:40:33] positioned me in Tim's and at the times
[1:40:35] Tim was still using the quotes and Tim
[1:40:37] brought out an understanding of the Holy
[1:40:40] Ghost better than I've ever seen in my
[1:40:41] entire life through my whole life of
[1:40:43] being born and raised in the message for
[1:40:45] the Tim printed out everywhere where
[1:40:47] brother Branham talked about the Holy
[1:40:48] Ghost and everywhere the scripture
[1:40:49] talked about the Holy Spirit and he tied
[1:40:51] it in and it gave me a revelation of the
[1:40:53] Holy Ghost like I've never seen before
[1:40:54] and that was a blessing to me in that
[1:40:57] time something drew me back to Florida
[1:40:58] and I went back to Florida and then the
[1:41:01] pastor down there that I was attending
[1:41:02] he did a study on the church age book
[1:41:04] and I got a greater understanding of the
[1:41:06] church ages and I've ever got before and
[1:41:08] I watched God I we placed me at Tim's
[1:41:10] for a season then placed me back in
[1:41:12] Florida for a season two and all my life
[1:41:14] as a teenager I prayed for a greater
[1:41:16] revelation of his word I heard brother
[1:41:17] Branham said pretty for a greater
[1:41:19] revelation of his word and I watched God
[1:41:21] how he positioned me here
[1:41:22] positioning me there and gave me a
[1:41:24] greater revelation of his word and they
[1:41:26] can't brought me back here and there was
[1:41:28] something wrong but out of that came
[1:41:30] came this and I watched brother Steven
[1:41:33] and I'm gonna give him a rose and not so
[1:41:36] he can get a big head or anything but I
[1:41:38] want to I know it's God working through
[1:41:40] him and I've heard so many of these
[1:41:42] things all my life being born and raised
[1:41:44] in the message so many of these things
[1:41:45] or where pastors will tie you know the
[1:41:48] message in with the scripture but never
[1:41:50] to the extent of brother Steven and I
[1:41:52] don't believe it's cuz like he's a he's
[1:41:53] our eighth messenger we know we don't
[1:41:55] have an eighth messenger I'm just saying
[1:41:56] I know he's not like more special than
[1:42:00] anybody else but what it is is I see
[1:42:02] that he has devoted so much time into
[1:42:05] studying this word in this and in this
[1:42:07] message like I've never seen before
[1:42:09] I'm so thankful for that I told my wife
[1:42:11] I said he didn't get this overnight he
[1:42:14] didn't get this in a week or a month
[1:42:16] this is a lifetime or however long he's
[1:42:19] been in this message of studying and
[1:42:21] digging in and time spent and I wanted
[1:42:24] to know that I appreciate it because now
[1:42:26] I believe God's placed me here first
[1:42:28] season I don't know if it's forever I
[1:42:30] don't know how long it's in his it's in
[1:42:31] his time but while I'm here the things
[1:42:34] I'm learning even just right here I've
[1:42:36] watched this this Moses and Aaron tied
[1:42:39] into the into the message but never to
[1:42:41] the extent of brother Steven dead
[1:42:43] tonight even with the three years and
[1:42:44] how the lay at the CNH started three
[1:42:47] years before brother Branham came on the
[1:42:48] scene just all these things so perfect
[1:42:51] and I believe it's just I believe it's
[1:42:54] just brother Steven completely giving
[1:42:56] himself over and studying and I'm Graham
[1:42:58] thankful for it I really am I could I
[1:43:00] would love to say and I'm almost done
[1:43:06] I'm almost done I just had to testify it
[1:43:08] was on my heart I'm sorry but I have to
[1:43:10] say I feel like I could listen to it for
[1:43:13] hours and at times I'm I get overwhelmed
[1:43:15] I can't keep up almost I know he goes
[1:43:18] slow but I'm just like oh it's so much
[1:43:19] it's so much I almost wish I could have
[1:43:21] like a 30 minute lesson every day you
[1:43:23] know every evening I have a 30 minute
[1:43:24] lesson but I'm so grateful for it I'm so
[1:43:27] grateful for being here for each one of
[1:43:29] you and for a pastor that really and
[1:43:33] just one last thing and I'll be done one
[1:43:34] last thing but how God talked to Moses
[1:43:38] and told Moses Moses said I'm not a good
[1:43:40] speaker
[1:43:40] so Moses God gave Moses Aaron you know
[1:43:43] as brother Stephen related it back to
[1:43:45] the message I'm doing the same thing and
[1:43:46] allowed Aaron to be Moses mouthpiece but
[1:43:49] Aaron said what Moses said and all my
[1:43:52] life going through the message and
[1:43:53] hearing preachers I watched so many
[1:43:55] times I'll they'll say what Moses said
[1:43:56] but they'll say what they think and what
[1:43:58] they have to say too and one thing I see
[1:44:00] about brother Stephen is he doesn't just
[1:44:02] say what he thinks but every single
[1:44:05] thing he says is what Moses said and
[1:44:08] it's what God said and that's what I
[1:44:10] look for as a pastor because I don't
[1:44:11] want to hear a man's opinion I want to
[1:44:14] hear what the message says because that
[1:44:17] was what was given to us in our time
[1:44:19] because what it says is what God has
[1:44:21] said the way he tied it into
[1:44:23] and like I said I'm giving him roses one
[1:44:26] one after another but I know it's
[1:44:28] because he has completely surrendered
[1:44:30] himself and I'm so grateful for it I'm
[1:44:32] thankful for I don't take it for I don't
[1:44:33] take it for granted not not from brother
[1:44:35] Steven and not from God because he
[1:44:36] placed them here but anyway I apologize
[1:44:38] y'all forgive me I tried to be brief
[1:44:40] will sing will sing a song real fast and
[1:44:43] will dismiss but uh God put this on this
[1:44:46] song on my heart as well so um I trust
[1:44:49] y'all know it spear to God move wretch
[1:44:53] your word in my heart feel my whole
[1:44:58] being consumed my life Spirit of God
[1:45:05] move an empty vessel I wanna be so that
[1:45:12] you can come Lord and fill me one more
[1:45:21] time say Spirit of God move right your
[1:45:26] word in my heart fill my whole being
[1:45:33] consumed my life Spirit of God move an
[1:45:39] empty vessel I wanna be so that you can
