[36:44] you've been praying okay you didn't sing
[36:48] that song by any chance
[36:50] amen falling in love with jesus
[36:54] it's right perfectly in line with the
[36:56] sermon
[36:58] so it's the holy spirit and i appreciate
[37:00] that brother micah daley certainly you
[37:02] were praying too
[37:04] and your song fell in line right
[37:06] everything
[37:08] and brother john begin to speak about
[37:10] the oncoming service
[37:12] his love is our body my god
[37:16] blessed be the name of the lord
[37:18] [Applause]
[37:20] amen hallelujah
[37:25] we appreciate all the family members
[37:27] this morning
[37:29] remember we don't have visitors here
[37:32] if i say visitor then it's going to be
[37:34] maybe something different
[37:37] but we have family members here and we
[37:40] appreciate
[37:40] everybody here and we appreciate the
[37:43] lord for healing his people
[37:45] and for his deliverance it seems like
[37:48] the devil was after us but the lord
[37:51] delivered us from all our trouble
[37:55] amen somebody asked me a question
[37:58] and i don't know if probably there is
[38:00] more than one person who had that
[38:02] question
[38:03] when i mentioned about the blood of
[38:04] jesus christ
[38:06] that the bride was more valuable than
[38:09] the blood of christ
[38:11] so i'm going to read couple quotes so to
[38:14] make sure if somebody else had that
[38:16] question
[38:16] you have your answer amen in the message
[38:19] if you need those quotes you let me know
[38:21] we can send the mass text
[38:23] in the message the mark of the beast and
[38:26] the seal of god
[38:27] preached in 1961 brother branham say
[38:30] that
[38:31] thank you musician for everything and we
[38:34] pray now
[38:35] that you are you shall bless us
[38:38] another thing that i would do if i had
[38:42] in my hand tonight a glass
[38:44] just one drop of the blood of the lord
[38:47] jesus
[38:48] how i would hold it to my heart
[38:52] i'll be almost afraid to breathe but
[38:55] then
[38:55] father in your sight you have given
[38:59] into my hand a greater
[39:02] amen the purchase of your blood
[39:06] your church that you gave
[39:09] your blood for to save it amen
[39:13] so god value you too much
[39:16] to the point that he have to lay down
[39:18] his own blood
[39:20] just to get you amen
[39:23] in the message expectation brother
[39:26] branham said that
[39:27] i have often thought how i would cherish
[39:30] in my hand a charger in other words a
[39:33] plate
[39:34] that held one drop of the blood of that
[39:37] sun
[39:38] but i realized tonight i hold great
[39:43] in his estimation before me
[39:46] is the purchase of his blood that he
[39:49] gave his blood
[39:51] that these might become his
[39:54] amen so god didn't value his blood much
[39:58] he looked at you he looked at me
[40:02] he says i need to get this blood so much
[40:05] to the point that i don't care if i have
[40:08] to shed my blood
[40:09] upon this earth amen blessed be the name
[40:13] of the lord how many receive the reading
[40:15] on the text so you should be ready
[40:18] prepare
[40:19] for the sermon this morning let's go
[40:22] to the book of genesis chapter 42.
[40:26] i will pray i have been praying that you
[40:30] stay alert
[40:32] by the grace of god because we're going
[40:34] to dig into some territory
[40:38] i hate to see people sleeping in church
[40:41] so please try your best if you're sleepy
[40:44] you can go back there where the deacons
[40:46] are
[40:47] you can stand there but i don't want you
[40:49] miss
[40:50] something because when you get to the
[40:53] mouth of god the numbers and things
[40:56] you need to really stay there so you
[40:58] understand that
[40:59] amen everybody knows what number three
[41:02] means right
[41:03] perfection right number five grace
[41:07] right number four i keep it in my pocket
[41:10] for next time
[41:11] [Laughter]
[41:15] number four is the number of the earth
[41:18] which is deliverance amen i will give
[41:21] you a quote lord dwelling
[41:23] as we're moving down in the future
[41:25] number six the number of men number
[41:27] seven

[41:30] number eight
[41:33] eternity praise god number nine
[41:38] brother robert he always get me amen
[41:41] number 10 no

[42:41] number
[42:43] amen and joseph 10 brethren
[42:46] went down to buy corn in egypt
[42:50] but benjamin
[42:53] somebody's phone is honor but benjamin
[42:56] joseph's brother jacob said
[43:00] not with his brethren for he said
[43:03] let's perhaps mischief before him
[43:06] we know that the children of jacob were
[43:08] 12.
[43:10] one stays in canaan one was joseph who
[43:13] was already gone
[43:15] now the one going into egypt to buy
[43:18] grain
[43:19] or corn or ten brother you might be
[43:22] seated
[43:23] let's drop to verse and they say
[43:27] your servants are water
[43:31] if you're sleeping shake yourself
[43:38] i believe brother wayne got your fire
[43:41] blazing so he can't be put up
[43:44] that quick and they said your servant
[43:49] are 12.
[43:54] 12 total
[43:57] which is a number of worship you already
[44:00] know that
[44:01] i already gave it to you here
[44:05] when they try by 12 it's a worship when
[44:08] they attend
[44:09] it's a trouble but when they went to
[44:11] egypt
[44:12] 10 of them went so they were going
[44:16] in carnality
[44:20] and they said your servants are 12
[44:22] brethren
[44:24] the sons of one man in the land of
[44:27] canaan
[44:28] and behold the youngest is this day with
[44:32] our father and one is not one day
[44:36] they thought joseph was already gone
[44:38] probably dead
[44:39] but he was not dead yet and joseph said
[44:42] to them verse 14
[44:44] that that
[44:47] is it that i spoke to you saying you are
[44:50] spies
[44:53] hereby you shall be proved by the life
[44:56] of pharaoh
[44:57] you shall not go forth from here except
[45:01] your youngest brother come here
[45:03] everybody clear
[45:05] amen you are ten here i need that
[45:07] eleventh one
[45:09] to come amen when the eleventh come
[45:13] then i know you're speaking the truth
[45:15] amen
[45:16] verse 16 send one of you
[45:20] and let him bring your brother
[45:23] and you shall be kept here in water
[45:27] so when they turn they're facing the
[45:30] prison
[45:34] amen they're going to be first
[45:38] prison joseph is telling them you take
[45:41] one of your brother
[45:43] and you send them back amen
[45:46] praise the name of the lord and you
[45:49] shall be kept in prison
[45:52] that your words may be proven
[45:55] whether there be any truth in you or
[45:57] else by the life of pharaoh
[46:00] surely you are spies verse 17
[46:04] and he put them all into word in all the
[46:07] word
[46:08] prison into word how many days
[46:15] you see now and brother branham say when
[46:18] they say
[46:19] three days it is not really three days
[46:22] we found uh esther three days
[46:27] fasting for three days it seems like she
[46:30] fasted from the first day
[46:31] second day third day then the fourth day
[46:34] she went uh-uh
[46:35] she fasted the first day the second day
[46:38] then the third day
[46:40] she went there jesus three days and
[46:42] three nights we thought
[46:44] he was one two three then four no
[46:47] one two then three because
[46:50] four you reached the point of lazarus
[46:54] who was in the graves thinking but david
[46:57] prophesied that corruption cannot be
[47:00] found
[47:01] in jesus so if you put four days
[47:04] you're gonna break the prophecy of david
[47:08] amen now joseph put his brother how many
[47:12] days
[47:13] so according to our mind we're gonna say
[47:17] the first day
[47:18] the second day the third day then on the
[47:21] fourth day
[47:22] they came out brother branham say when
[47:24] they say three days
[47:25] it is not truly three days that's why
[47:28] you need
[47:29] a prophet
[47:32] amen watch the next verse and you're
[47:35] gonna see why you need a prophet
[47:37] and joseph verse 9 18 and joseph said
[47:41] to say to them duh
[47:44] i thought it should be the fourth day
[47:49] you see one key from william branham
[47:53] then you begin to
[47:56] [Laughter]
[47:58] and joseph said to them the third day
[48:03] oh my god there is a revelation here
[48:07] that i left honor but it's in hosea
[48:11] you're going to be revived in three days
[48:15] you remember that i left it the holy
[48:19] spirit is bringing that back to me
[48:21] i will send you the scripture by brother
[48:23] david if you remind me

[48:28] chapter six if i'm not mistaken in three
[48:31] days
[48:32] god will revive israel in three days
[48:36] amen the first the second the third day
[48:40] amen and joseph said to them the third
[48:43] day
[48:44] this do and leave for our fear god
[48:47] if you be true man let one of your
[48:51] brethren
[48:52] he was trying to send them to go there
[48:55] but he is now
[48:56] holding one of them back amen let
[49:00] one of your brethren be bound in the
[49:03] house of your prison
[49:05] everybody clear so nine are gonna go
[49:08] out one is gonna stay in prison
[49:11] amen you go carry corn for your family
[49:16] for the famine of your houses in other
[49:19] words joseph is telling them
[49:21] you came 10 people here amen
[49:24] that's a number that is a problem amen
[49:28] now i'm gonna send one of you in other
[49:30] words
[49:31] ten i'm gonna say i'm gonna hold one of
[49:34] you
[49:35] in other words ten minus nine equal
[49:38] one one of you is gonna stay here
[49:42] you came with a corner number and you
[49:46] are going with
[49:47] number nine
[49:50] remember that pretty good okay praise
[49:53] the name of the lord
[49:54] job to verse 24 and he turned
[49:58] himself about from them and wept
[50:02] and returned to them again and commune
[50:05] in other words spoke
[50:07] and communed with them and took from
[50:09] them who
[50:11] why did he take simeon
[50:15] so the one staying his name is what
[50:18] so simeon is the one that is staying in
[50:21] jail
[50:23] he's staying in prison
[50:26] he's holding the key of the prison
[50:29] of israel amen
[50:32] and to liberate simon benjamin must be
[50:36] revealed
[50:38] amen there is something in benjamin
[50:41] when he comes you take benjamin
[50:45] plus nine plus simeon plus
[50:48] joseph then israel is back again in 12
[50:52] with worship
[50:57] hallelujah he took from them simeon
[51:01] and burned him before their eyes
[51:04] let's go to exodus chapter 17.
[51:09] please stay awake
[51:14] exodus chapter 17 we talked about the
[51:18] first banquet we're trying to get to the
[51:20] second banquet you need
[51:22] today so you can enter the second
[51:24] banquet amen
[51:26] exodus chapter 17 verse 1.
[51:29] you already read the whole verse we send
[51:31] this scripture ahead of time
[51:34] the whole chapter and all the
[51:37] congregation of the children of israel
[51:40] journey from what the wilderness what
[51:44] why did they call that sin
[51:49] they started from the wilderness it's a
[51:52] wilderness it's a desert
[51:55] it is called sin
[52:01] after their journeys according to the
[52:05] commandment of the lord
[52:06] and preached in what referendum
[52:10] oh my god so they move from sin
[52:14] all the way to referendum
[52:17] what is going on
[52:20] amen and there was no
[52:24] water for the people to drink in other
[52:26] words god sends you to a place
[52:28] you reach there there is no water did
[52:31] god make a mistake
[52:33] because david said that he leaded me in
[52:35] the
[52:36] to the steel water but now he's leading
[52:39] israel and there is no order
[52:44] hallelujah they got to refer them
[52:47] the the description of referendum
[52:50] is no water no h2o
[52:54] amen no order to drink job to verse five
[52:58] because you already read everything at
[53:00] home if you know in verse 2 the people
[53:03] chatted with him in other words the
[53:05] people got angry
[53:07] why are the people getting mad about the
[53:10] water
[53:10] why there is a key mystery to their
[53:13] anger
[53:14] you need a prophet verse 5
[53:17] and the lord said to moses go on before
[53:21] the people
[53:22] and take with you of the elders of
[53:24] israel because the work of redemption
[53:26] need to be done
[53:28] if you remember in the book of ruth when
[53:30] they want to do redemption
[53:31] the elders must be there so god is
[53:33] trying to do a demonstration of
[53:35] redemption
[53:36] he needs the elders amen the elders of
[53:39] israel
[53:40] and your road everybody there
[53:44] wherewith you smote the river so not
[53:47] just your road
[53:49] but i want to remember you something
[53:51] that is connected to the road
[53:54] you take the road that you smote the
[53:57] river
[53:57] when moses smote the river he turned the
[54:01] water
[54:01] into blood amen
[54:04] we know by the scripture that the water
[54:07] is the multitude of people
[54:10] amen so turning water into blood is
[54:13] speaking about death
[54:16] everybody there it is different than
[54:18] jesus turning water into wine
[54:21] which is the baptism of the holy spirit
[54:25] flowing on the people amen so he's
[54:28] reminding him like
[54:29] take the road that you struck death
[54:34] praise the name of the lord and there
[54:36] shall come
[54:37] water out of it anybody clear
[54:42] let me go to verse five take the road
[54:45] your road where if you smote the river
[54:48] take in your hand
[54:49] and go behold i will stand before you
[54:52] there upon the rock
[54:55] in horrible we already talk about horeb
[54:59] you know horeb right you need to go to
[55:01] the unchanging pattern of god
[55:03] and you shall smart the rock so
[55:07] that's why isaiah said he was smitten
[55:09] struck
[55:10] by god stricken by god you shall smite
[55:14] the rock
[55:15] and there shall come water water so
[55:18] water was
[55:19] in refeedim
[55:22] are you following me but it was not a
[55:25] visible water
[55:27] the water of refidem was sealed
[55:31] in the rock
[55:35] amen so when david said
[55:39] he leaded me beside the steel water
[55:43] you need to find out if god sends you to
[55:45] a widow woman
[55:47] and the widow only have the last meal
[55:50] how can a widow with the last meal give
[55:53] food to elijah it's a third pool mystery
[55:57] there will be a creation of food to
[56:00] sustain
[56:01] both elijah and the widow woman that
[56:04] food
[56:04] was hidden under the seal
[56:08] [Music]
[56:10] hallelujah and moses did so
[56:13] in the sight of all the elders of what
[56:16] israel jumped to verse 8
[56:20] then kim who so
[56:23] the first experience of exodus chapter
[56:27] 17
[56:28] is god providing water
[56:31] to his people number one the people that
[56:34] were thirsty
[56:36] that were looking for water god first of
[56:39] all uh satisfied them with
[56:42] water from the rock
[56:46] everybody following me then the second
[56:49] thing
[56:50] in referendum still amalek
[56:53] attack amalek
[56:56] never attack israel before
[57:00] the water
[57:04] are you with me you must first drink
[57:07] the water of life then
[57:11] your drinking of water
[57:14] will lose amalek against you
[57:20] hallelujah stay in tune
[57:24] stay connected then came amalek
[57:28] and fought with israel in water
[57:31] only in referendum after israel have
[57:34] drunk
[57:35] off the water from the rock and
[57:38] satisfied then for some reason
[57:41] american amalek didn't come before
[57:45] amalek must come after the experience of
[57:52] redemption
[57:57] nine and moses says to joshua
[58:00] choose out choose us out
[58:03] man and go fight
[58:06] when it was time to produce the water
[58:10] for israel moses went and did the work
[58:14] amen moses struck struck the rock
[58:18] and he produces water ever clear
[58:21] then the people drunk water then that
[58:24] experience
[58:25] released amalek amen
[58:28] but when amalek is coming to fight
[58:31] moses doesn't fight amalek moses take
[58:35] the responsibility
[58:37] of amalek fight into the hand of
[58:40] joshua
[58:42] [Music]
[58:48] so when you drink the water of life
[58:52] you must make sure you have joshua with
[58:54] you
[58:55] because joshua will be the one to take
[58:58] care of amelia
[59:01] not moses hallelujah
[59:06] and moses said to joshua choose us out
[59:09] men
[59:09] and go out fight with family to
[59:13] moral do you see not
[59:16] the same day by the next day
[59:22] first day second day third day
[59:25] the first banquet but the second banquet
[59:29] on the
[59:30] second day
[59:34] hallelujah fighter malek tomorrow i will
[59:38] stand
[59:38] on the top of the hill with the road of
[59:41] god
[59:42] i thought it was the road of moses in my
[59:44] hand so
[59:46] joshua did as moses has said to him and
[59:49] fought with amalek and moses aaron and
[59:52] er
[59:53] went up to the top of the hill we
[59:55] already explained you this
[59:56] everybody clear jump to verse 13
[1:00:00] and joshua disconfited amalek
[1:00:03] and his people with what the edge of the
[1:00:08] so joshua fight with a sword amen
[1:00:19] hallelujah amalek is destroyed
[1:00:23] with a sword you we know what a sword is
[1:00:26] right
[1:00:27] okay praise the name of the lord
[1:00:31] this conflicted amalek with the edge of
[1:00:33] the sword
[1:00:35] and the lord said to moses go back to
[1:00:38] verse 12
[1:00:40] but moses hand were heavy
[1:00:45] amen and they took a stone
[1:00:48] and put it under him because as they
[1:00:51] were fighting the battle
[1:00:53] moses lifts up his hand toward god
[1:00:56] and as long as the hand of moses were
[1:00:59] out
[1:01:00] up joshua was winning
[1:01:04] the battle are you there but when moses
[1:01:07] begin to get tired because of
[1:01:10] the gravitational force
[1:01:20] something in you a spirit by water
[1:01:25] it's a natural earthly force your
[1:01:28] arm was made to hang down
[1:01:31] and when you wash your hand you defy the
[1:01:35] very laws of water
[1:01:38] i'm not teaching physics it's in the
[1:01:40] message
[1:01:42] amen it has to be supernatural
[1:01:46] it's against scientific against all
[1:01:50] scientific things for you to
[1:01:52] break the law of what gravitation
[1:01:55] it cannot be done unless there is
[1:01:57] something supernatural
[1:01:59] your arm will continually do what
[1:02:03] so the forces that were fighting moses
[1:02:06] was a gravitational force
[1:02:09] it was an earthly forces it was a
[1:02:12] worldly
[1:02:12] forces and when that worldly force take
[1:02:16] over moses joshua began to lose the
[1:02:19] battle
[1:02:24] father god i commit them in your hand
[1:02:27] they broke every scientific rule
[1:02:30] according to science
[1:02:32] gravitation hold your hand
[1:02:35] like he keep our feet on the ground
[1:02:38] according to the rules of her or in
[1:02:41] in the rules our hand could not raise
[1:02:44] because they're going downward
[1:02:46] because of the weight and gravitation
[1:02:49] hold them down but these people raise
[1:02:52] their hand
[1:02:53] it shows they got a spirit in them that
[1:02:56] can control their what
[1:02:58] so it's something that is overcoming
[1:03:00] amalek in the flesh
[1:03:05] everybody clear praise the name of the
[1:03:08] lord verse 12
[1:03:09] then but moses hand were heavy and they
[1:03:12] took a stone and put it under him
[1:03:15] and he sat there on and aaron and earth
[1:03:18] stayed
[1:03:19] praised the name of the lord aaron and
[1:03:21] earth stayed his hand
[1:03:23] the one on one side and diade on the
[1:03:25] other side
[1:03:26] and his hand were steady until what
[1:03:31] until they sunset
[1:03:37] amalek is defeated on the sunset
[1:03:43] not on the third day but tomorrow
[1:03:47] on the sunset when the sun begins to set
[1:03:51] down that's when you beat amalek
[1:03:55] everybody clear let's go to roman 8 then
[1:03:58] we're going to pray
[1:03:59] a whole message has already been
[1:04:00] preached
[1:04:05] romans chapter 8 i must keep many of
[1:04:10] them
[1:04:12] the sake of time i believe you read it
[1:04:14] at home
[1:04:19] verse 10 let me skip some of them
[1:04:23] and if christ and if christ
[1:04:26] being you the what
[1:04:30] the body is what remember in romans 7 we
[1:04:33] found out that there is
[1:04:35] death they sin in the body everybody
[1:04:37] here
[1:04:38] okay the body is dead because of what
[1:04:42] that's why paul said when i want to do
[1:04:44] good something is
[1:04:45] in me fighting that fight comes
[1:04:49] after amen but the spirit is life
[1:04:53] because of
[1:04:54] righteousness but if the spirit of him
[1:04:58] that raised up jesus from the dead
[1:05:02] dwell in you we talked about the other
[1:05:06] man
[1:05:08] you remember and the inner man
[1:05:12] the flesh the other man is the one that
[1:05:14] have death
[1:05:16] and sin right here but paul is telling
[1:05:19] you if there is sad man
[1:05:22] have the spirit in other words if in
[1:05:25] your soul
[1:05:26] you are already sealed with the holy
[1:05:29] ghost
[1:05:32] are you following me if in your soul you
[1:05:35] already
[1:05:36] drank the water of rephidim
[1:05:42] amen then don't worry about
[1:05:46] the amalekites
[1:05:52] [Music]
[1:05:53] but if the spirit of him is it clear
[1:05:57] if the spirit of him that raise up jesus
[1:06:01] from the dead dwells in you
[1:06:04] he that raised up christ from the dead
[1:06:06] shall also do what
[1:06:09] not your soul but what he is now
[1:06:12] dealing with amalek in the flesh
[1:06:16] amen it is the power of resurrection
[1:06:21] amen that power come to this on the
[1:06:24] success
[1:06:28] hallelujah we shall also
[1:06:32] quicken your water not your soul
[1:06:36] because the spirit already dwell in you
[1:06:40] amen you are on the fight only
[1:06:43] against yourself against the carnality
[1:06:46] of your flesh
[1:06:48] the last of the eyes the last of the
[1:06:50] flesh and the pride of life
[1:06:54] hallelujah it shall quicken your mortal
[1:06:58] body
[1:06:59] by his spirit that do what
[1:07:02] he were already redeemed from the soul
[1:07:05] therefore brethren we adapted not to
[1:07:08] work

[1:09:48] lord as we committed unto the hand
[1:09:50] in the name of jesus christ amen
[1:09:54] god bless you you already been seated
[1:09:57] now we are dealing
[1:09:58] with part 12 of our sermon
[1:10:02] the title as we already know is that
[1:10:05] it's king a hazarist
[1:10:07] three feast and esther to banquet i will
[1:10:10] again remind you
[1:10:11] to stay awake amen we found out
[1:10:14] that there were three feasts that were
[1:10:16] made by the king
[1:10:18] the first feast as we explained to you
[1:10:22] that king ahazaris made a feast and when
[1:10:25] he made the feast
[1:10:26] he was the feast of the princes and the
[1:10:29] servant
[1:10:30] and we found out that the princes and
[1:10:32] the servant are israel
[1:10:34] they are the jewish amen and that feast
[1:10:37] was made for the jewish people
[1:10:39] which was speaking about the
[1:10:41] dispensation of the law
[1:10:44] which was a jewish dispensation
[1:10:46] everybody clear with me
[1:10:48] then on the second feast we found out
[1:10:51] that
[1:10:51] king ahazaris made a feast of seven days
[1:10:56] when he made that feast of seven days he
[1:10:59] spoke
[1:10:59] of the seven church ages which is now
[1:11:02] the gentile
[1:11:04] dispensation where god is going to the
[1:11:07] gender
[1:11:08] to look for a wife for his own
[1:11:11] name are you there with me and 20 was
[1:11:14] time for his wife to come up to him
[1:11:16] god sent seven chamberlain which was the
[1:11:20] seven angel
[1:11:21] that came down on sunset mountain in
[1:11:24] order to call the blood
[1:11:26] amen and that feast was characterized by
[1:11:30] wine
[1:11:31] which was the baptism of the holy spirit
[1:11:35] throughout the seven church ages because
[1:11:37] under the seven church ages
[1:11:39] the ministry of christ is the son of god
[1:11:42] which is the ministry
[1:11:44] of the holy spirit everybody clear so
[1:11:46] far
[1:11:47] praise the name of the lord then the
[1:11:49] third feast was the feast of esther
[1:11:52] and this feast happened when king
[1:11:55] ahazarez chose esther
[1:11:57] he unite himself in marriage with esther
[1:12:01] and the king made a feast for esther
[1:12:04] and that was the marriage supper of the
[1:12:07] lamb because we are joined here on the
[1:12:09] earth
[1:12:09] but we're going into our marriage supper
[1:12:12] for three and a half years
[1:12:14] which was speaking about the rapture
[1:12:16] going into the
[1:12:17] marriage supper everybody clear now when
[1:12:20] we finish those three feasts
[1:12:22] we started with the first banquet of
[1:12:25] esther
[1:12:26] ever clear and on the first banquet of
[1:12:29] esther
[1:12:30] we found out that there is not only two
[1:12:33] ones banquet
[1:12:34] but we have two banquets of esther and
[1:12:37] we found out
[1:12:38] that esther who have a time
[1:12:41] that she and the king did not meet
[1:12:44] together
[1:12:45] and that time was 30 days everybody
[1:12:48] cleared so far
[1:12:50] and 30 has the number three and he also
[1:12:53] has the number zero
[1:12:54] and we also explain to you that number
[1:12:57] zero is a circle
[1:12:58] which is speaking about eternity which
[1:13:01] is exactly number eight
[1:13:03] and number eight is the number of
[1:13:05] eternity because number eight have two
[1:13:08] circles
[1:13:09] which is speaking about the marriage
[1:13:11] about the groom and his wife
[1:13:13] when they get to married together
[1:13:15] they're coming from eternity and they're
[1:13:18] going back to eternity
[1:13:20] everybody clear so far press the name of
[1:13:22] the lord
[1:13:23] then when we look at that number three
[1:13:26] there was a mystery to that number three
[1:13:29] where esther fasted for how many days
[1:13:32] so she fasted from the first day the
[1:13:34] second day
[1:13:35] on the third day she went to the king
[1:13:38] and she approached the king so that the
[1:13:40] king can come
[1:13:41] on to her every clear so it was a coming
[1:13:45] of the king
[1:13:46] into the queen everybody clear now if
[1:13:49] you notice
[1:13:50] here we already have the seven church
[1:13:52] edges that are already explained here
[1:13:55] but for some reason they give us again
[1:13:58] the three last step of esther
[1:14:01] going to the king because we found out
[1:14:03] that
[1:14:04] in the book of revelation revelation 2
[1:14:07] and revelation 3 speak about the
[1:14:10] dispensation of
[1:14:11] the seven church ages he spoke about the
[1:14:13] first messenger
[1:14:15] he spoke about the second messenger he
[1:14:17] spoke about the third messenger
[1:14:19] and all seven messengers but when we
[1:14:21] went in revelation 14
[1:14:24] we found out that the bible made a size
[1:14:27] of three angels not the three beginning
[1:14:31] angels
[1:14:32] but the three angels of the last time
[1:14:36] which were speaking about luther wesley
[1:14:39] and pentecost because they were the
[1:14:41] three step of grace
[1:14:43] which was justification sanctification
[1:14:45] and what
[1:14:46] baptism of the holy spirit so just like
[1:14:50] in the book of revelation
[1:14:52] he first speak about the seven church
[1:14:54] edges then he insists on three
[1:14:57] last angel in the book of esther he
[1:15:00] spoke about a feast of seven days
[1:15:03] but he have to come back also and insist
[1:15:06] on the three
[1:15:07] last days everybody there
[1:15:10] three last step which we saw that he
[1:15:13] spoke about luther
[1:15:14] wesley and pentecost then there was a
[1:15:18] now
[1:15:18] pouring on azusa street it was the
[1:15:21] coming of
[1:15:22] the king into the queen but the problem
[1:15:25] was
[1:15:26] in azusa street when the queen
[1:15:29] came into the first banquet fulfilling
[1:15:32] the third day
[1:15:33] everybody clear heaven was there
[1:15:37] her man was happy hammond was enjoying
[1:15:42] her man was eating her man was drinking
[1:15:45] everything was fine in other words the
[1:15:48] outpouring
[1:15:50] of azusa street never bothered the
[1:15:53] airman
[1:15:55] everybody clear it is a pentecostal
[1:15:59] anointing it is an anointing
[1:16:02] that does not disturb the devil
[1:16:07] everybody there it is the anointing of
[1:16:10] the anointed one of the end time
[1:16:14] it is an anointing that you can play the
[1:16:17] instrument in the church
[1:16:18] and you can still live like a devil
[1:16:22] it is an anointing that you can prophesy
[1:16:25] and yet your life is unclean the devil
[1:16:29] is still happy the devil is still
[1:16:31] praying
[1:16:32] the devil is still comfortable in your
[1:16:35] life
[1:16:36] you can wear high heels you can have
[1:16:39] tight dresses
[1:16:41] you can expose your body but you can
[1:16:43] sing in the church like an
[1:16:45] angel that is a pentecostal
[1:16:48] anointing hallelujah
[1:16:52] if you are under this feast you need to
[1:16:55] come out
[1:16:57] amen we don't want a holy ghost
[1:17:00] that cannot clean your life you don't
[1:17:03] want a holy ghost
[1:17:04] that cannot change you you don't want a
[1:17:07] holy ghost that make you comfortable
[1:17:09] when you watch pornography you want a
[1:17:12] holy ghost that condemn you
[1:17:14] when you do something that is bad
[1:17:18] [Applause]
[1:17:21] everybody clear that's why we need to
[1:17:23] move from number three
[1:17:25] and we need to go to the second banquet
[1:17:28] because the second banquet
[1:17:30] put you on the eternity everybody clear
[1:17:34] the message came to tell you come out
[1:17:38] from among them my people
[1:17:40] come out from the first banquet because
[1:17:43] under the first banquet
[1:17:44] the devil is comfortable
[1:17:48] amen you need an anointing
[1:17:51] that will make the devil mad
[1:17:54] you need an anointing that the devil is
[1:17:57] not comfortable

[1:18:16] blessed be the name of the lord brother
[1:18:19] branham
[1:18:20] under the feast of trumpet in revelation
[1:18:23] 11

[1:20:28] all of the tabernacle all the wood
[1:20:31] all of everything in the tabernacle
[1:20:36] everything spoke of what
[1:20:39] so when you read the bible you see
[1:20:42] they're speaking about a tree
[1:20:44] it's speaking about jesus christ they're
[1:20:46] speaking about a cup

[1:21:11] of the entire if you read the bible

[1:25:01] we preach the word
[1:25:05] in what even the hidden wisdom of god
[1:25:10] so it is not a wisdom of god that you

[1:25:20] hallelujah and it was hidden

[1:28:25] husband
[1:28:26] if you notice elohim spoke about
[1:28:30] having a child but sarah spoke about
[1:28:33] having pleasure it is a mystery of
[1:28:36] marriage
[1:28:40] everybody ready because according to the
[1:28:44] original creation
[1:28:46] amen every species
[1:28:49] was created originally from the ground
[1:28:53] are you following me the woman was the
[1:28:56] only by-product
[1:28:58] that was pulled from the men and they
[1:29:01] all
[1:29:01] and all the entire creation
[1:29:05] they were the the animal
[1:29:09] the bird and everything else were
[1:29:12] melting
[1:29:13] only for one season
[1:29:16] and to have their children
[1:29:19] go to your marriage and divorce are you
[1:29:22] there
[1:29:23] the dog met for one time the
[1:29:26] bird was made for one time but the only
[1:29:29] difference
[1:29:30] is that the woman the woman can make
[1:29:34] any time are you there
[1:29:38] so when elohim came elohim was perfectly
[1:29:41] in love with the zodiac
[1:29:44] elohim said sarah will have a
[1:29:47] shout when according to the time of
[1:29:52] elohim is perfect but the woman that is
[1:29:56] already following sin
[1:29:57] says that should i have what
[1:30:00] for hell it is pleasure for elohim means
[1:30:04] one time one child and that was it
[1:30:09] hallelujah so when you read genesis 18
[1:30:15] sarah is an old woman sarah cannot have
[1:30:19] children sarah doubted god
[1:30:22] you move down a little bit down the road
[1:30:25] i'll be malek so sarah
[1:30:32] i thought sarah was a drummer
[1:30:37] i thought sarah was an old woman i
[1:30:40] thought sarah could not have a baby
[1:30:42] i thought sarah said it's impossible to
[1:30:44] have pleasure
[1:30:46] are you following me but when i be me
[1:30:48] like saucer
[1:30:50] he said that woman looks freddy
[1:30:54] how can a grandma look pretty
[1:30:58] we speak the mystery of god we
[1:31:02] speak we preach christ in what a
[1:31:05] mystery when you read it you're going to
[1:31:08] read the story
[1:31:09] but when the prophet comes
[1:31:16] are you following me when the message
[1:31:18] comes
[1:31:19] the message shows you that something
[1:31:22] happened to sarah sarah became
[1:31:26] young again it is in the bible
[1:31:30] but it is silver are you there
[1:31:34] so when you are located you are
[1:31:36] unlocking
[1:31:38] the back part mind of the bible
[1:31:41] are you following me the logos of the
[1:31:44] bible
[1:31:45] the bible is god in printed
[1:31:48] form but there is a living god
[1:31:51] in the bible that living god is the
[1:31:55] message
[1:31:56] of the hour that's why the bible
[1:31:59] is crushed the message is crushed
[1:32:02] when you reject the message you are
[1:32:04] rejecting the
[1:32:10] bible
[1:32:12] are you there you are rejecting the
[1:32:15] bible
[1:32:16] because the message only brings you the
[1:32:19] hidden part
[1:32:20] of the bible and the hidden part is
[1:32:23] connected
[1:32:24] to the bible when you reject the message
[1:32:27] you actually rejecting the living word
[1:32:31] the logos amen
[1:32:35] you don't understand what you're doing
[1:32:37] you are rejecting the bible
[1:32:39] and you fall down in blindness of
[1:32:42] laodicea
[1:32:43] that's why in revelation 10 7
[1:32:46] when the seven ninja sound the trumpet
[1:32:49] all the what
[1:32:54] per se are preaching all the what
[1:32:58] mysteries of god should be what
[1:33:01] so the message unlock the mysterious
[1:33:05] part
[1:33:05] of the bible and hand it to you
[1:33:08] the message is the bible reveal
[1:33:17] are you there the message is the bible
[1:33:21] reveal it is the absolute
[1:33:25] interpretation of the bible
[1:33:28] without the message the bible is a
[1:33:31] sill book
[1:33:34] hallelujah why do we have to understand
[1:33:38] this
[1:33:39] everybody ready are you still awake did
[1:33:42] i lose someone
[1:33:44] everybody is awake praise be the name of
[1:33:47] the lord
[1:33:48] now we found out last time that we spoke
[1:33:52] about
[1:33:52] jacob and rachel everybody following me
[1:33:57] now we found out that at the birth of
[1:34:00] benjamin
[1:34:02] oh my god where am i okay we found it
[1:34:05] we found out that at the birth of
[1:34:08] benjamin
[1:34:09] are you there you rachel died
[1:34:12] because rachel was a top of the bride
[1:34:15] that cannot be on earth
[1:34:17] at the same time that benjamin is on the
[1:34:20] earth
[1:34:20] so as we go back to the scripture the
[1:34:24] bible is written in what
[1:34:26] so when you read stories in the bible
[1:34:29] there
[1:34:30] are messages locked in this story
[1:34:33] amen there as a proof we read esther
[1:34:38] we found that that was speaking about
[1:34:39] the jewish dispensation
[1:34:41] we found the seven days were speaking
[1:34:43] about the seven church ages
[1:34:45] we found the feast of esther was
[1:34:47] speaking about the marriage supper
[1:34:48] we find many stuff that are locked in
[1:34:51] symbols
[1:34:53] in form in tap in shadow
[1:34:56] in mysteries and you need the prophet to
[1:34:59] unlock
[1:35:00] that are we following me
[1:35:03] are you back on that pretty good make
[1:35:05] sure you stay in tune
[1:35:07] when jacob left his home
[1:35:11] and he went to lebanon jacob met
[1:35:14] rachel when she met he met rachel
[1:35:18] something happened to jacob
[1:35:23] jacob went and spoke to his
[1:35:25] father-in-law
[1:35:26] about his daughter rachel
[1:35:30] rachel was a normal woman
[1:35:33] and she was beautiful and jen leben have
[1:35:37] not only one daughter he has two
[1:35:40] daughters
[1:35:41] but for some reason when jacob went into
[1:35:45] leban housing
[1:35:47] when he met rachel something
[1:35:50] struck the heart of jacob
[1:35:54] that which struck the heart of jacob
[1:35:57] is called love
[1:36:01] are you following me are you following
[1:36:04] me
[1:36:05] is anybody sleeping okay praise the name
[1:36:08] of the lord
[1:36:09] then jacob himself represented grace
[1:36:16] brother branham i was praying one day
[1:36:19] after reading the life of joseph in the
[1:36:21] bible
[1:36:22] and i thought such a perfect man
[1:36:26] abraham was election brother david if
[1:36:28] you can give me a little bit so i can
[1:36:30] lower my tone abraham was election
[1:36:34] isaac was justification and jacob was
[1:36:38] what ever clear in the identified
[1:36:41] masterpiece
[1:36:43] jacob which means so planter
[1:36:46] and that is a deceiver and we realize
[1:36:49] that jacob's life really represented
[1:36:52] what
[1:36:53] because he was the grace of god all the
[1:36:57] time
[1:36:58] everybody there grace move
[1:37:01] into the house of lebanon
[1:37:07] are you following me is everybody in
[1:37:09] june the grace of god
[1:37:11] left abraham left isaac
[1:37:15] and went into a gentle end
[1:37:18] and the grace of god moved into the
[1:37:21] house of lebanon
[1:37:23] remember last time lebanon was a type of
[1:37:26] what
[1:37:27] denominational preacher the grace of god
[1:37:31] came
[1:37:32] when some of you were in denominational
[1:37:35] church
[1:37:38] are you following me then the grace of
[1:37:41] god came
[1:37:42] but grace cannot move without
[1:37:46] love first love must come
[1:37:50] and love make way for grace
[1:37:55] in the message divine love
[1:37:58] what is it when divine love is projected
[1:38:02] sovereign grace do what
[1:38:06] and he has to in other words when
[1:38:09] love starts then grace
[1:38:12] take over are you following me
[1:38:15] hallelujah
[1:38:17] so jacob when he spoke to lebanon
[1:38:21] he said my my uh my uncle
[1:38:24] i love your daughter and i'm gonna work
[1:38:26] for how many years
[1:38:29] when we begin to get in numbers in the
[1:38:31] bible
[1:38:33] that's why you need a prophet brother
[1:38:35] branham says
[1:38:37] there has been threefold there has been
[1:38:40] threefold purpose
[1:38:42] in all these things that bring us back
[1:38:44] to a three
[1:38:46] and seven again seven seals
[1:38:50] seven vows and so forth you can go seven
[1:38:54] church edges
[1:38:55] seven plague and all of that and now
[1:38:58] in trees
[1:39:02] number three amen
[1:39:05] in threes and sevenths
[1:39:09] is god's number in his
[1:39:12] mathematics of revealing
[1:39:15] his so when you see three in the bible
[1:39:20] seven in the bible something is luck
[1:39:23] ready why didn't jacob say
[1:39:27] i'm gonna work for eight years
[1:39:30] why he didn't say i'm gonna work for
[1:39:32] three years
[1:39:34] why he didn't say i'm gonna work for 11
[1:39:36] years
[1:39:37] or two years or one years he chose seven
[1:39:40] years
[1:39:41] remember jacob was a prophet
[1:39:44] is everybody awake i'm going 35 miles an
[1:39:48] hour before i take off
[1:39:49] everybody clear now brother
[1:39:53] the bible says here in genesis 29
[1:39:57] you can see the home and leban had how
[1:40:00] many daughter
[1:40:03] brother stephen you preaching esther
[1:40:06] what does this have to do with fester

[1:40:53] earth from lebanon was
[1:40:56] leah everybody clear
[1:41:01] and the name of the younger one was
[1:41:04] who so rachel came
[1:41:08] after by birth
[1:41:12] everybody clear verse 17
[1:41:15] leah was standardized
[1:41:20] in other words when you get in check of
[1:41:22] housing
[1:41:24] and you see leah coming out there is
[1:41:27] one thing from leah that's going to
[1:41:30] strike you
[1:41:32] it is only heist
[1:41:35] amen you will see a woman walking
[1:41:39] but if you leave the house of jacob and
[1:41:42] you go back to your house
[1:41:44] and somebody asked you a question did
[1:41:46] you see jacob elder daughter
[1:41:49] you say yes oh the one that had
[1:41:53] tender eyes amen everything you remember

[1:42:09] lord
[1:42:10] amen but rachel
[1:42:13] was beautiful and well
[1:42:16] feathered she has the favor like esther
[1:42:20] everybody clear so when they say yes but
[1:42:22] what about the younger one oh
[1:42:24] my god she's gorgeous
[1:42:28] she is beautiful you can see her
[1:42:32] so when you talk about rachel
[1:42:35] you gotta talk about her whole being you
[1:42:38] cannot just say
[1:42:39] esther hair you say man esther is
[1:42:41] beautiful if you look at her
[1:42:43] hairway her way of walking the way she
[1:42:45] talked everything is just
[1:42:47] gorgeous what about leia
[1:42:50] her eyes
[1:42:54] are you there and jacob
[1:42:57] loved who jacob didn't love
[1:43:01] leia his love was
[1:43:04] in leah in richard
[1:43:08] jacob wants to come
[1:43:11] jump the first one and go straight to
[1:43:15] leah
[1:43:16] and to get leah straight to rachel
[1:43:19] to get rachel jumping leah
[1:43:26] and jacob loved rachel and said
[1:43:29] i will serve these seven years for
[1:43:32] rachel
[1:43:32] thy younger daughter verse 20
[1:43:36] and jacob served seven years for rachel
[1:43:39] and they seemed unto him but a few days
[1:43:44] for the love he had for her
[1:43:47] so it was a great love that seven years
[1:43:51] seems like it's two days when he sleeps
[1:43:54] he raised he just dreamed rachel when
[1:43:58] he's going
[1:43:58] he's just thinking about rachel
[1:44:00] sometimes he hit the tree wait a minute
[1:44:02] what were you doing i was thinking about
[1:44:03] rachel
[1:44:04] he was a strong lover what about leah oh
[1:44:09] she's okay
[1:44:13] are we there now we found out a mystery
[1:44:16] here
[1:44:17] that there are two churches
[1:44:22] are you following me a woman in the
[1:44:25] bible stop what
[1:44:27] everybody clear so we have two churches
[1:44:30] here
[1:44:31] everybody follow me the first one is
[1:44:34] rachel which is the younger are you
[1:44:38] there
[1:44:39] and rachel her name
[1:44:43] means a you
[1:44:48] a you is a female
[1:44:51] sheep
[1:44:57] are you following me that's why when
[1:45:00] jacob come when grace is coming
[1:45:04] grace is looking for a wife
[1:45:08] but that was must be a lamb on the
[1:45:11] female
[1:45:12] version
[1:45:15] are you following me are you following
[1:45:18] me
[1:45:19] praise the name of the lord hallelujah
[1:45:22] now rachel hello the daughter was
[1:45:26] liam the bible just told us that rachel
[1:45:30] was what
[1:45:30] beautiful and well favored
[1:45:34] everybody clear but liam esther
[1:45:37] which i just explained to you is a part
[1:45:40] of the bride
[1:45:41] just like esther rachel is the brother
[1:45:44] she's the one who is the female sheep
[1:45:48] because when god created adam he created
[1:45:51] adam
[1:45:52] male and female so
[1:45:55] jacob was looking for his female party
[1:46:00] are you there are you there that's why
[1:46:04] the bible said
[1:46:05] and the lord said it is not good for
[1:46:07] adam to be what
[1:46:09] everybody clear he was not adam and
[1:46:12] steve
[1:46:13] it was adam and eve
[1:46:18] are we clear so when jacobs come
[1:46:22] the woman that struck her is richard
[1:46:26] the one that have the name of his female
[1:46:30] sheep so rachel speak of your brother
[1:46:33] because she was well favored just like
[1:46:37] esther when people saw her esther was
[1:46:39] what
[1:46:40] were favored everybody clear
[1:46:45] you understand the first church but when
[1:46:47] you look at leah
[1:46:50] the only thing you remember about leah
[1:46:54] is only the tender eyes of leah
[1:46:57] leah have soft eyes when you see leah
[1:47:01] her eyes is like they are tired
[1:47:06] are you there when you see me her eyes
[1:47:10] are weary when you sit here
[1:47:14] her eyes look like somebody
[1:47:18] that is under the anointing
[1:47:25] brother branham help me
[1:47:28] in the message that breached between the
[1:47:31] seven church churches
[1:47:33] brother branham said the
[1:47:37] as means what
[1:47:40] singing means what
[1:47:45] stay awake i told you
[1:47:48] from the beginning are you there means
[1:47:51] prophet or what
[1:47:54] christ the mystery of christ is revealed
[1:47:57] in his own word
[1:47:59] down through the edges we start off from
[1:48:02] the foundation
[1:48:03] from the first church age he's talking
[1:48:06] about the
[1:48:06] church amen when the seed went
[1:48:10] in the ground the complete seed
[1:48:13] then he come through the feet defeated
[1:48:16] who
[1:48:18] come back through wesley we go in there
[1:48:21] in the chest then into the pentecost of
[1:48:24] the what
[1:48:26] and what speaking in tongues everybody
[1:48:29] there
[1:48:30] now it is in the word which means what
[1:48:35] everybody clear malachi
[1:48:39] falls so the ice speaks about
[1:48:44] prophet
[1:48:46] are you there so when you look at mia
[1:48:51] the only thing that attracts your
[1:48:54] attention to leah
[1:48:56] is the prophetic anointing upon leader
[1:49:01] that's why her eyes are like wee-wee
[1:49:04] are you there are you following me
[1:49:08] are you following me praise the name of

[1:49:48] the father by what
[1:49:54] are you following me so the first woman
[1:49:58] that was birthed from jacob
[1:50:02] is a type of the old testament church
[1:50:09] are you following me are you following
[1:50:11] me
[1:50:12] the old testament is born before the new
[1:50:15] testament
[1:50:17] rachel comes second layer
[1:50:20] comes first and the characteristic
[1:50:24] of the old testament church is what
[1:50:28] david can you pray
[1:50:31] can you say can you can you go with me
[1:50:33] david
[1:50:34] a prophet abraham prophet

[1:50:48] the whole church
[1:50:56] are you there
[1:50:59] are you there the old testament church
[1:51:02] is based upon prophetic
[1:51:06] anointing that's leah
[1:51:12] everybody clear did i lose anyone
[1:51:16] praise the name of the lord the prophecy
[1:51:19] came not
[1:51:20] in what not new time
[1:51:24] by the will of men but what
[1:51:28] who are holy men of god everybody clear
[1:51:31] holy man of god speak as they were moved
[1:51:35] by the word

[1:51:41] spoke about the dispensation
[1:51:44] of the law
[1:51:49] are you following me hallelujah
[1:51:54] but
[1:51:57] that dispensation have how many years
[1:52:02] jacob want to work for what by
[1:52:05] working with leah for leah
[1:52:09] jacob by working for rachel
[1:52:13] the first seven years he didn't know he
[1:52:16] was working for leia
[1:52:22] in other words grace was under the law
[1:52:27] but grace was locked
[1:52:33] they started out really with grace
[1:52:36] to begin with jacob before they heard
[1:52:40] the lord
[1:52:41] they had grace are you there because
[1:52:45] when it was the day
[1:52:47] that jacob must take rachel he went to
[1:52:50] bed
[1:52:50] he woke up and he was lia he got mad he
[1:52:54] went to his father-in-law
[1:52:55] he said why did you give me leah his
[1:52:57] father-in-law said no

[1:53:02] you must go through the elder you must
[1:53:05] go
[1:53:06] with leah first you must go under the
[1:53:09] dispensation of the law first
[1:53:11] before you move to the dispensation of
[1:53:14] rachel
[1:53:16] [Music]
[1:53:18] are you following me did i lose anybody
[1:53:22] are we okay brother bottom say wow they
[1:53:26] were in egypt
[1:53:27] without law no one down there was just
[1:53:31] the priest and so forth
[1:53:32] but they didn't have any laws the law
[1:53:35] had not
[1:53:35] yet been given grace provided them a
[1:53:38] prophet
[1:53:39] which was moses and also grace provided
[1:53:42] an atonement
[1:53:43] the sacrificial name everybody clear the
[1:53:46] atonement had been provided
[1:53:49] before there was any law grace
[1:53:52] jacob was before doing what
[1:53:57] so when he was working he was working
[1:54:01] for leah are you there grace was before
[1:54:05] the
[1:54:05] there was during the law and
[1:54:09] afterlaw there also there was joshua
[1:54:13] representing what was right along with
[1:54:16] law
[1:54:17] but could not be enforced as long as
[1:54:20] law was in its proper place
[1:54:24] are you there even though jacob was
[1:54:26] christ
[1:54:27] working into it they lock him they say
[1:54:29] you can't get richer
[1:54:31] because you must go by the law the law
[1:54:35] the first born is israel you must go
[1:54:38] through israel first
[1:54:40] before you get to the gentile brand
[1:54:42] everybody clear so far
[1:54:44] so it's speaking there speak about the
[1:54:47] jewish dispensation
[1:54:49] and that dispensation have how many
[1:54:51] years
[1:54:52] praise the name of the lord brother
[1:54:54] branham in the water of separation
[1:54:56] the seventh different streak represented
[1:54:59] the seven church ages
[1:55:01] israel natural and the gentile in what
[1:55:06] seven church edges just exactly though
[1:55:10] israel had how many
[1:55:14] that's why jacob worked seven years for
[1:55:17] leah
[1:55:18] everybody following me let me go again
[1:55:21] the second one
[1:55:22] in the patmos vision one of these days
[1:55:26] i shall bring up and show you that
[1:55:28] israel had what
[1:55:31] two and tap exactly with what
[1:55:34] that's why it took seven years for leah
[1:55:38] and when leban spoke to jacob he said
[1:55:41] you must work again how many years
[1:55:45] seven more years for who which now is
[1:55:49] the seven churches of the
[1:55:51] gender everybody following me
[1:55:55] praise the name of the lord when you
[1:55:58] look at the children of leah
[1:56:00] is everybody tired praise the name of
[1:56:03] the lord
[1:56:04] when you look at the children of leah
[1:56:07] because
[1:56:08] both leah and jacob and rachel
[1:56:12] produce children unto jacob
[1:56:15] but if you look at the first four
[1:56:19] children of leah because leah had the
[1:56:22] first child
[1:56:23] the second child the third child
[1:56:27] the fourth child and her womb was closed
[1:56:31] and we just saw that leah represented
[1:56:34] the old jewish church
[1:56:36] which characteristic is the prophet
[1:56:40] the prophetic anointing we speak about
[1:56:43] the dispersation of the
[1:56:45] law the first child of
[1:56:48] leah was reuben brother branham helped
[1:56:52] me
[1:56:53] now reuben was the man
[1:56:57] he was the first one the weakest of the
[1:57:00] bunch
[1:57:01] everybody following me didn't jacob say
[1:57:04] in genesis 49
[1:57:06] ruben that i'm a first of my strength
[1:57:09] the first of my
[1:57:10] strength but like water you went up
[1:57:13] on my couch and he found my couch he
[1:57:15] went and slept with his father's
[1:57:17] concubine
[1:57:19] and lived with his father conquered that
[1:57:22] is
[1:57:22] the immoral of what human
[1:57:26] being the immoral of human being
[1:57:29] was expressed unto ruben which came from
[1:57:33] leah
[1:57:37] are you following me hallelujah
[1:57:40] in romans 7 paul said
[1:57:44] i did not sin
[1:57:48] did you read your romans 7 except when
[1:57:51] the
[1:57:51] law came out are you there
[1:57:54] and sin taking occasion by the law
[1:57:59] are you there because the law came
[1:58:02] to magnify sin nobody
[1:58:06] knew the word adultery nobody knew the
[1:58:09] word stealing
[1:58:10] people were doing they look came and
[1:58:12] begin to say
[1:58:13] this is stealing this is lying this is
[1:58:17] cheating
[1:58:17] this is this the law leah the
[1:58:20] dispersation of leah
[1:58:22] exposed the immoral of human
[1:58:26] under ruby
[1:58:29] are we awake are we awake
[1:58:34] praise the name of the lord the animals
[1:58:37] don't have their memories
[1:58:39] the lion none of these things has that
[1:58:42] but the man run with the next man wife
[1:58:45] and so forth that's the immoral that is
[1:58:48] produced through the dispensation
[1:58:50] of leah that's when these the sin is
[1:58:53] coming
[1:58:53] because men sin in the garden of eden
[1:58:56] and sin was hidden
[1:58:57] so god sent the lord to choke sin so
[1:59:00] that there's law
[1:59:02] can make sin appear on the same
[1:59:05] so he can destroy it every kid
[1:59:10] the second child the second child
[1:59:13] of leah was who
[1:59:18] anybody clear in our reading
[1:59:22] we found out that the bread and that one
[1:59:24] to jacob were how many
[1:59:30] brother branham 10 is there what
[1:59:33] a bad number that's right to start with
[1:59:36] 10 is a bad number they had 10 tribes
[1:59:41] and them was just all what
[1:59:44] everybody clear anybody care
[1:59:48] paul said that i was sold under
[1:59:51] the law are you there
[1:59:55] he said they call no mind is what
[1:59:58] enmity against who
[2:00:02] because under the law that's when the
[2:00:05] carnal mind was expressed
[2:00:08] are you following me then when the tribe
[2:00:11] of israel
[2:00:12] saw joseph joseph went to the gentile
[2:00:16] which is a type of jesus christ going to
[2:00:18] us
[2:00:19] and the jew were locked up under the law
[2:00:23] the jewish people up to today are still
[2:00:26] under the law
[2:00:28] they still follow the dispensation of
[2:00:30] moses
[2:00:31] when they approach christ
[2:00:36] when they approach joseph they are
[2:00:39] approaching with carnality
[2:00:43] everybody following me under the
[2:00:46] dispossession of
[2:00:47] the world and the law josephine christ
[2:00:52] put them in prison
[2:00:57] are you there and brother problem say
[2:01:01] the law is the one that put you in jail
[2:01:08] lord help me let me go right here
[2:01:13] when he put them in jail he put them in
[2:01:16] three days
[2:01:18] because according to hosea chapter 6
[2:01:21] israel will be redeemed in what
[2:01:25] because they are still under the law
[2:01:27] everybody follow me
[2:01:29] now when joseph requested benjamin
[2:01:33] he taught them that none of you go
[2:01:37] one of you stays the one who stays in
[2:01:40] the priest on his name is who
[2:01:44] are you there but none left
[2:01:47] what is number nine
[2:01:51] brother branham there was three watches
[2:01:54] the first watch started from nine until
[2:01:57] twelve
[2:01:58] the second watch started from twelve to
[2:02:00] three the third watch
[2:02:03] of the night was counted from three to
[2:02:05] six mysteries brothers
[2:02:07] now we got three three threes
[2:02:11] which is what imperfect
[2:02:16] everybody follow me so when joseph sent
[2:02:19] them he sent the tribe in imperfection
[2:02:25] because the law could not bring anybody
[2:02:28] unto perfection
[2:02:32] are you following me so simeon must be
[2:02:36] kept in jail and to liberate simeon
[2:02:40] you need benjamin and to have
[2:02:43] benjamin you need moses and elijah
[2:02:46] to bring the seventh seal to israel
[2:02:49] to bring perfection back to israel and
[2:02:52] bring the tribe back to number 12 which
[2:02:55] is worship
[2:02:56] because the true worshiper who worship
[2:02:59] god
[2:03:00] in spirit and in
[2:03:05] did i lose anybody no flesh can be
[2:03:09] saved by keeping the law the law was
[2:03:12] only here
[2:03:14] the lord didn't have any remedy the law
[2:03:17] was the word
[2:03:19] that's why they keep sinning
[2:03:25] everybody that's why they keep simeon
[2:03:29] you need a prophet are you there the law
[2:03:32] was god policeman that put you in what
[2:03:37] that's why they keep simeone the child
[2:03:40] of
[2:03:40] leah you stay in prison because leah
[2:03:44] is the dispensation of the law pull me
[2:03:47] simply on him
[2:03:48] are you there the third child was
[2:03:52] liver who produced the levitical
[2:03:55] priesthood
[2:03:56] under the law in christ
[2:03:59] the levitical priesthood died in calvary
[2:04:03] he came from leah hallelujah
[2:04:07] and judah also came from leah
[2:04:13] galatian 4 4 but when
[2:04:17] the fullness of time was come god

[2:04:28] there
[2:04:34] are you there because i'm the judah came

[2:04:40] but christ must be born under the law
[2:04:43] and the leader
[2:04:49] are you there to redeem them that were
[2:04:52] under the law that we might receive the
[2:04:55] adoption of what

[2:05:05] the law putting you in jail
[2:05:07] liver speaking about the priesthood of
[2:05:10] levitical priesthood
[2:05:11] and judah christ born under the law
[2:05:15] to redeem you from the law leah
[2:05:18] is the dispensation of israel
[2:05:22] of the jewish dispensation which if
[2:05:24] you'll read

[2:05:52] that work seven years for rachel
[2:05:55] and rachel produce one child
[2:05:59] his name is what joseph means what
[2:06:04] perfection i already gave you the quote
[2:06:08] ephesians father husband
[2:06:11] love your wife even as christ also loved
[2:06:15] the church
[2:06:16] and gave himself for it that he might
[2:06:19] sanctify the church
[2:06:23] and cleanse it the church with the
[2:06:26] watching of the world
[2:06:27] by the word that he may present
[2:06:31] it to himself a glorious church
[2:06:36] everybody not
[2:06:40] not having what perfection
[2:06:44] oh what if you notice there is two words
[2:06:49] the first word is spot
[2:06:56] blessed be the name of the lord
[2:06:59] i thought i will go quickly but it looks
[2:07:02] like it's a steak
[2:07:06] the first dime is spot
[2:07:09] anybody following me i have not even
[2:07:12] gathered into what we read
[2:07:14] the second one is what
[2:07:17] wrinkle spot
[2:07:21] speak of sin
[2:07:24] everybody there sin
[2:07:27] that affected your soul
[2:07:31] which is the enemy
[2:07:34] everybody following me wrinkle affect
[2:07:38] what
[2:07:42] your body which is the outside man
[2:07:49] so let's go back now and read it
[2:07:54] can we read it back now with the eyes of
[2:07:57] a prophet
[2:07:59] now let's go back and read it he will
[2:08:02] present
[2:08:03] to himself a glorious church
[2:08:06] not having spot or not having sin
[2:08:10] no wrinkle we're gonna have a change of
[2:08:14] the body
[2:08:15] it's the redemption of the inside man
[2:08:18] and the redemption of the outside man
[2:08:21] meaning that
[2:08:22] when we're gonna meet christ in the air
[2:08:24] we're gonna have glorified body
[2:08:26] a body with that sin and without rico
[2:08:30] because because we're gonna be younger
[2:08:32] again
[2:08:33] the wrinkle will go away
[2:08:39] a body with that spot which is
[2:08:42] the first water that comes from the rock
[2:08:46] take away your spot because it's the
[2:08:48] washing off the
[2:08:50] what the washing of the what
[2:08:54] remember when moses struck the rock what
[2:08:56] came
[2:08:58] it's washing you off first and then when
[2:09:01] amalek
[2:09:02] come it's taken care of though
[2:09:06] because the body is with death that's
[2:09:09] why we're gaining age we get gray hair
[2:09:12] so paul is telling you that he's gonna
[2:09:14] take off your soul
[2:09:16] and christ is working on you washing you
[2:09:19] by the word
[2:09:20] and when he wash you he's gonna present
[2:09:22] you to himself
[2:09:24] and when you're gonna see him not sin in
[2:09:27] you
[2:09:27] and you're gonna be young again that's
[2:09:30] what paul is telling you
[2:09:34] everybody there and that ministry
[2:09:36] commander
[2:09:37] rachel because he birthed perfection
[2:09:40] everybody clear presented to himself
[2:09:44] a glorious church not having spot
[2:09:47] or wrinkle or any such thing
[2:09:50] whatever is connected to it but
[2:09:53] that it should be what and with that
[2:09:56] what
[2:09:57] perfection comes under richer
[2:10:02] everybody clear everybody clear
[2:10:05] so your first feast of king of hazaris
[2:10:08] which is the dispersation of the law is
[2:10:12] leah
[2:10:14] did you get it your second feast
[2:10:18] of king a hazaris which is the feast of

[2:10:51] leaving the earth there was a departure
[2:10:54] of rachel from the earth going into the
[2:10:57] marriage supper which is the third feast
[2:10:59] of king

[2:11:15] and then the death of rachel removing
[2:11:18] her from the world
[2:11:19] taking her into the presence of the lord
[2:11:21] is the rapture
[2:11:22] of the church because the church reached
[2:11:25] perfection

[2:11:29] spot or blemish
[2:11:30] into the marriage supper which is the
[2:11:33] third christ of king a hazard

[2:12:18] you tell me we stop here if you okay we
[2:12:20] move on
[2:12:22] you okay shake yourself
[2:12:26] because we're getting into something
[2:12:28] different
[2:12:29] in our reading today
[2:12:32] we found in exodus 17 can i raise this
[2:12:38] that israel left the wilderness of sin
[2:12:42] hallelujah lord
[2:12:46] there was a wilderness called the
[2:12:49] wilderness
[2:12:50] or the desert the wilderness of sin
[2:12:55] that word didn't appear there by any
[2:12:57] chance
[2:13:00] it's a wilderness of s-i-n
[2:13:03] and we know sin is what
[2:13:06] everybody clear
[2:13:09] israel departed from the wilderness of
[2:13:12] sin
[2:13:15] before we move on let me say this
[2:13:19] i believe that all of the old things
[2:13:22] was the top of the new to come
[2:13:26] what israel was in there
[2:13:29] we are in the so when we are talking
[2:13:32] about
[2:13:33] this journey here this is what happened
[2:13:35] to israel naturally speaking
[2:13:38] but to us it is applied spiritually
[2:13:42] everybody there because we were born in
[2:13:45] what
[2:13:46] we were born in the wilderness of sin
[2:13:49] [Music]
[2:13:51] everybody shaping what we were in the
[2:13:54] wilderness of sin
[2:13:56] coming into the world speaking what
[2:13:59] under the wilderness of sin
[2:14:01] spiritually application spiritual
[2:14:03] application
[2:14:05] what israel was in the natural we are in
[2:14:07] the spiritual
[2:14:09] god lives so yeah naturally was what
[2:14:12] he's doing for us today what
[2:14:14] spiritually praise god so israel moved
[2:14:18] from the wilderness of sin
[2:14:20] we all were born in sin shepherding
[2:14:23] iniquity
[2:14:24] somewhere in a nightclub some were
[2:14:26] cheating
[2:14:27] some were gin drug some were smoking
[2:14:30] some were drinking beer or candlestick
[2:14:33] born in the wilderness of sin
[2:14:36] amen bear land of sin amen then the
[2:14:40] bible says
[2:14:41] that israel moved from there until
[2:14:44] referendum
[2:14:46] anybody following me they moved up to
[2:14:50] there
[2:14:51] onto a place called refining
[2:14:54] if you look at this like this
[2:14:58] it seems like israel moved from here
[2:15:01] all the way to here but there is a
[2:15:03] mystery
[2:15:05] anybody there the mysteries in number 33
[2:15:10] these are sermons when you get a chance

[2:15:53] now
[2:15:53] they move from the wilderness of sin
[2:15:56] into a place that is called
[2:16:00] dafta hallelujah
[2:16:04] at the opening of the seventh hill the
[2:16:07] bible became
[2:16:08] anew
[2:16:12] and they departed from devka and he camp
[2:16:16] into what
[2:16:17] alas
[2:16:22] everybody clear now
[2:16:25] you see your mystery and then they
[2:16:28] removed from a lush and encamped into
[2:16:31] what
[2:16:32] look at the characteristic of resident
[2:16:34] where there
[2:16:35] was no water for the people to what but
[2:16:38] the water was hidden in a rock
[2:16:44] no water to drink
[2:16:47] no water yes brother michael
[2:16:52] amen so now based on the scripture
[2:16:56] we understand now that the journey of
[2:16:59] israel
[2:17:00] moved from wilderness of sin burning sin
[2:17:03] sharpening it quickly coming into the
[2:17:05] word speaking lies
[2:17:07] we moved to dharfka what does he mean
[2:17:10] because sin we know then from davka we
[2:17:14] go to a loss
[2:17:15] from a lush we go to work for them and
[2:17:18] we already explained to you that the
[2:17:20] first place
[2:17:21] that we start our journey we are
[2:17:23] starting
[2:17:24] from sin born in sin sharpening iniquity
[2:17:28] coming into the world speaking life
[2:17:30] that's when we start
[2:17:32] we are preparing you to deal with amalek
[2:17:35] with him
[2:17:36] are you there then from there we move
[2:17:39] into a place that is called daftka
[2:17:43] davka means knocking
[2:17:49] everybody here you get into a stage in
[2:17:52] your life
[2:17:54] that god begin to knock in your heart
[2:17:57] [Music]
[2:17:59] everybody following me because we are
[2:18:02] in the edge of laodicea and love this
[2:18:06] we saw christ on the outside
[2:18:10] what was christ doing
[2:18:13] everybody there trying to do what to get
[2:18:16] back inside so he can sup with you
[2:18:19] because jesus christ said we will come
[2:18:22] and we will sup
[2:18:23] with you everybody everybody clear
[2:18:26] so after you are in sin you are in an
[2:18:29] iniquity
[2:18:30] you are in the mud of sin living all
[2:18:33] kind of
[2:18:34] uncleanly life suddenly the gospel comes
[2:18:38] and you feel like somebody is knocking
[2:18:41] somebody is calling you somebody is
[2:18:43] pulling you
[2:18:44] you reach the stage of dothka
[2:18:49] anybody there then the preacher preaches
[2:18:53] and they say who want to accept jesus
[2:18:56] christ who want to come to the altar
[2:18:58] then probably you raise your hand you
[2:19:00] say i want to give my life to christ
[2:19:03] and when they do that they pray for you
[2:19:05] you come at the altar
[2:19:06] they pray for you the sinner repentance
[2:19:09] prayer
[2:19:10] you give your heart to the lord then
[2:19:12] from there on you are baptized
[2:19:14] and you are part of the church
[2:19:18] you move from there from davka
[2:19:22] to a loss a lush means a crowd of men
[2:19:27] you enter the congregation
[2:19:31] everybody following me everybody
[2:19:33] following me
[2:19:35] brother brother that is the sinner
[2:19:39] comes to hear the word faith cometh by
[2:19:42] hearing
[2:19:43] after he hears the word then he become
[2:19:46] into the fellowship
[2:19:48] of the church you get into a loss
[2:19:53] you are part of the church now we call
[2:19:55] you brother
[2:19:56] at the beginning when you came here we
[2:19:58] say who's that man today over there
[2:20:00] when you give your life they baptize you
[2:20:02] you begin to come to church we begin to
[2:20:03] call you
[2:20:04] brother because you reach a loss you are
[2:20:07] in the church
[2:20:09] amen and after he hears the word that
[2:20:12] receive it
[2:20:14] then you baptize him christian baptism
[2:20:17] and that brings him into what a loss
[2:20:21] then he gets out there in the water
[2:20:24] everybody clears so far then after you
[2:20:28] reach the step of a lotion
[2:20:30] then that's when you leave and you get
[2:20:33] into refuge everybody following me
[2:20:37] refugee means there is no other there
[2:20:41] but the uh the meaning of uh refedeem
[2:20:46] there is a message there the meaning of
[2:20:48] referendum i'm going to tell you
[2:20:50] the first first of all the
[2:20:51] characteristic of referendum
[2:20:53] is that there is no order one
[2:20:56] israel which this place called
[2:20:58] referendum
[2:21:00] and there was no other israel command
[2:21:03] against moses how many reads does
[2:21:06] chapter 17
[2:21:07] you know what i'm talking about
[2:21:09] everybody clear israel got mad against
[2:21:12] moses
[2:21:13] israel began to murmur to chad with
[2:21:17] moses
[2:21:18] amen the reason why they were chatting
[2:21:21] with moses
[2:21:22] was because of thirst
[2:21:27] because they were thirsting forward if
[2:21:30] you read your scripture at home
[2:21:33] why test can make somebody so angry
[2:21:37] brother brother then i was looking
[2:21:40] and thinking about that word thirst and
[2:21:43] i look up in the dictionary
[2:21:45] to see what it means and here is what
[2:21:48] webster says
[2:21:49] it is a what
[2:21:52] it is a painful desire
[2:21:55] that's why people get mad are you there
[2:21:59] a painful when you want something so bad
[2:22:03] until it becomes painful to you
[2:22:07] it is not a natural thing to thirst
[2:22:10] test is the natural things remember what
[2:22:12] happened to israel natural
[2:22:14] to us is what spiritual
[2:22:17] it's just simply something that god has
[2:22:20] given us
[2:22:22] that we could to give us a desire for
[2:22:25] something
[2:22:26] so god blesses a thirst there in your
[2:22:29] life
[2:22:29] for you to touch after him we're going
[2:22:32] slowly
[2:22:34] amen and this thirst
[2:22:37] this control tower that's set in what
[2:22:41] so the thirst brother branham is saying
[2:22:44] here
[2:22:44] it's speaking about a spiritual thirst
[2:22:48] everybody following me is something that
[2:22:51] god
[2:22:53] give to warn him of the desire
[2:22:56] that is needful for him and there is two
[2:23:00] different kind of thirst
[2:23:02] there is a thirst physically and
[2:23:05] there is a test what spiritually
[2:23:08] physically
[2:23:09] that was israel spiritually that is
[2:23:11] applied to us everybody clear so far
[2:23:14] press the name of the lord then in
[2:23:17] psalm 42 first one david says that
[2:23:21] as a heart painteth after the what
[2:23:26] what a brook so bentif my what
[2:23:30] so now the thirst of a christian
[2:23:33] after you come out of sin you went
[2:23:37] and god knock in your heart and then you
[2:23:40] baptize
[2:23:41] you get baptized you listen to the word
[2:23:43] of god you get into the congregation
[2:23:46] a thirst will rise from your soul
[2:23:52] everybody following me a thirst
[2:23:55] from the soul david says that as the
[2:23:59] heart penteth after the water book
[2:24:01] naturally my soul spiritually
[2:24:05] dusted after thee oh god
[2:24:08] my soul tested for god
[2:24:12] which god the living god
[2:24:16] not a dead god not a historical god
[2:24:20] but a god that can speak to you a god
[2:24:24] that can heal you a god that can deliver
[2:24:27] you
[2:24:27] and god that can bless you a god that is
[2:24:30] the same
[2:24:31] yesterday today and forever
[2:24:35] that's the god that my soul is testing
[2:24:38] after
[2:24:40] amen when shall i come
[2:24:43] and appear before the god
[2:24:46] in psalm 63 verse 1
[2:24:50] david says when he was in the wilderness
[2:24:53] of judah
[2:24:54] remember in the wilderness he said
[2:24:58] o god doubt my god early
[2:25:01] without seeking my what
[2:25:04] not the body of david my soul
[2:25:08] tested for thee my what
[2:25:12] now david introduced two elements here
[2:25:15] i wish i have time everybody there
[2:25:19] now in psalm 63 david now
[2:25:23] is explaining us two tests
[2:25:26] hallelujah david is saying that
[2:25:30] not only does my soul
[2:25:34] not only that's the inner man
[2:25:38] thirst after you lord but my flesh
[2:25:43] my body is also groaning
[2:25:47] romans chapter 8 because in this body we
[2:25:50] also
[2:25:51] grown my flesh
[2:25:56] my body the outside man
[2:26:00] is also groaning

[2:26:16] is testing after you my soul is testing
[2:26:20] after the living god
[2:26:21] not only does my soul test but my body
[2:26:25] also
[2:26:25] is dusting after me the soul deal with
[2:26:29] the spot
[2:26:30] and the body deal with the wrinkle

[2:26:55] the soul
[2:26:56] and my what cry out to what
[2:27:00] over here it was the soul that was
[2:27:04] thirsting for the living god
[2:27:06] but right here the body also is crying
[2:27:10] for redemption are you there
[2:27:13] because the whole creation is groaning
[2:27:17] waiting for the manifestation of the son
[2:27:20] of god

[2:27:24] themselves

[2:28:10] the lord is my shepherd i shall not
[2:28:14] want he leadeth me beside the still word
[2:28:19] but when israel is led here of the lord
[2:28:23] he reached a point where there is no
[2:28:26] water
[2:28:27] in refidem but referedim means
[2:28:30] rest or a resting place
