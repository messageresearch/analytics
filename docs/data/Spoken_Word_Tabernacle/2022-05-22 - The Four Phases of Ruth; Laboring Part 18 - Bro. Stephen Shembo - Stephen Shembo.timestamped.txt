[34:14] usually when people do this kind of
[34:16] stuff they sell them

[36:51] it is not you it's the result
[36:56] hallelujah let's stand and go to our
[36:58] scripture this morning
[37:00] amen
[37:02] blessed be the name of the lord
[37:15] we stop
[37:16] on wednesday we have to change the title
[37:23] i miss you on wednesday
[37:24] [Laughter]
[37:27] but
[37:28] yeah they told me you caught it you you
[37:30] already caught on me amen
[37:32] not only brother greg i miss all of you
[37:34] i was like i hope i wish the whole
[37:36] church was there amen but i know if he
[37:39] missed they gotta be a legitimate
[37:42] reason amen let's go to ruth chapter two
[37:45] verse eight
[37:47] ah
[37:48] this cargo is heavy
[37:52] so i don't know how we're going to
[37:54] deliver it
[37:56] but let's see how the lord will lead
[37:59] roof chapter 2.
[38:01] i tried to move in ruth chapter 3 i came
[38:04] there is so much in this scripture you
[38:06] read it and then you read the next time
[38:08] something open up you say i got it and
[38:10] you read next time something again open
[38:12] up we touch the unlimited that's right
[38:15] amen
[38:16] verse let me read verse six so
[38:21] that will save you down the road and
[38:23] then we will go to verse eight
[38:26] the bible says and the servant that was
[38:28] set over the reapers you understand this
[38:30] now this language answer it and say
[38:34] it is the jewish damsel
[38:40] in other words when you look at roof
[38:44] there is nothing on the outside
[38:48] that looked like a jewel
[38:52] nothing
[38:53] yet he's already a jew amen
[38:58] see i told you you might be seated
[39:01] amen
[39:03] so when they present the roof it's easy
[39:05] to look and say
[39:07] that's not an israelite
[39:09] very easy
[39:12] very easy
[39:13] because when you go to the brazen altar
[39:15] you don't see changes
[39:17] on the outside
[39:18] you're still the same amen
[39:20] you say it is the moabitish demuzel that
[39:24] came back with naomi out of the country
[39:27] of moab she's still even identified with
[39:30] her country so there is no much change
[39:32] on the outside that you can tell that
[39:35] this woman belongs to the uh nation of
[39:38] israel when you look at her straight
[39:40] ahead you can tell she's not from here
[39:42] she's from another country amen
[39:45] but she was not anymore from that
[39:47] country because she already said my
[39:49] people your people will be my people
[39:51] your god will be my god so she was no
[39:54] more more about but when you look at her
[39:56] on the outside she still looks like a
[39:59] moaba
[40:00] hey buddy okay so far let's jump to
[40:02] verse eight
[40:03] then say boaz to roof
[40:07] hear you not my daughter
[40:09] go not to glean in another field
[40:12] neither go from here
[40:14] but abide fast by the
[40:18] maiden
[40:19] boaz didn't tell her to abide first by
[40:22] the reapers
[40:26] everybody okay
[40:27] he says abide with the maidens
[40:30] amen that's the commandment so her
[40:33] liberty
[40:34] was now restricted
[40:39] let me start it again
[40:40] she could go to any field
[40:43] and glean and get whatever she want
[40:46] everybody okay but once she met boaz
[40:50] boas restricted
[40:52] her liberty
[40:56] so before boaz you can stream anybody
[41:02] you can listen to
[41:04] anybody as long as the christian
[41:07] but once you meet boaz
[41:10] then you're
[41:12] you are restricted
[41:13] only to one specific field
[41:18] because the other field can give you
[41:19] food
[41:21] but they can never give you marriage
[41:23] they can never give you redemption
[41:26] only the field of boars can give you
[41:29] redemption
[41:30] in addition to what everybody else can
[41:33] do hey back here so once you hit boaz
[41:36] you meet him your liberty is kinda
[41:39] restricted you cannot go any more out
[41:42] the way you were going
[41:44] because he need to channel you into a
[41:47] different pipe
[41:49] anybody okay so far
[41:50] blessed be the name of the lord lord i
[41:53] didn't even give you the scripture job
[41:55] to verse 15
[41:58] and when
[41:59] she was raising up
[42:01] to glean
[42:02] boaz commanded his young men saying
[42:06] let her glean even among the sheaves i'm
[42:08] repeating the same scripture wednesday
[42:10] because we could not even touch it and
[42:12] we approach her not
[42:14] and let fall also some of her
[42:16] some of the handful of purpose for her
[42:20] and leave them that she may glean them
[42:22] and rebuke her not we spoke on wednesday
[42:25] that we have two foods
[42:27] they were the food that
[42:29] roof labor or work for
[42:32] anybody care
[42:34] and another food she didn't really work
[42:36] for
[42:37] it was given purpose for
[42:40] on purpose
[42:42] anybody care from boaz through the
[42:44] reapers hey mark here in other words as
[42:47] you work
[42:49] boaz is working
[42:51] amen
[42:53] amen so when you come up you coming up
[42:56] with a double portion
[43:01] everybody okay so far
[43:03] blessed be the name of the lord verse 17
[43:06] so she gleaned in the field until
[43:09] evening
[43:11] and beat out that she had gleaned so
[43:14] there is some work going on here
[43:16] and it was about a nephi of barley
[43:19] hopefully i'm gonna get it one if i for
[43:22] a day
[43:24] what does it mean
[43:27] amen
[43:28] blessed be the name of the lord let's
[43:30] drop to verse uh
[43:34] verse
[43:35] 18. and she took it up and went into the
[43:38] city and her mother-in-law saw what she
[43:41] gleaned and she brought forth and gave
[43:43] to her that she had reserved after she
[43:47] was so fast two kinds of food again job
[43:50] to verse 21.
[43:52] remember boaz told her to abide by the
[43:54] maidens
[43:56] amen
[43:57] watch roof when she comes back at home
[44:00] and they ask her
[44:02] what happened verse 21
[44:04] and roof the moabites say
[44:08] he boasts say to me also
[44:11] you shall keep fast by my young men
[44:16] is that what boaz told her
[44:19] this is roof talking
[44:21] what did the man tell you oh no he said
[44:23] you need to keep fast by the man by the
[44:25] young man but boaz told her you need to
[44:28] stay by the maiden
[44:30] amen watch something between the line
[44:33] amen
[44:34] you need to keep fast by my young men
[44:36] until they have ended all my harvest
[44:40] and
[44:42] verse 22 now me say to wolf her
[44:45] daughter-in-law
[44:46] it is good my daughter that you go out
[44:50] with his
[44:52] where did naomi know this
[45:00] who told naomi this
[45:03] you see this bible is different
[45:05] who taught naomi this
[45:09] amen she came back oh what happened she
[45:11] was so excited she said boy i said naomi
[45:15] recalibrated her corrected her like no
[45:18] what they told you is stay by the
[45:21] maidens
[45:22] do they have cell phone in these days
[45:24] do they have facebook they can text
[45:27] how what happened here
[45:32] amen
[45:33] what is the communication there
[45:36] let me help you
[45:38] go back to verse 11.
[45:41] just bear with me
[45:45] and boaz verse 10
[45:48] then she fell on her face and bowed
[45:50] herself to the ground
[45:52] and said to him why have i found grace
[45:54] in your sight in your eyes that you
[45:57] should take knowledge of me saying i am
[45:59] uh
[46:00] on the outside nothing
[46:03] and boaz answered and said to her
[46:06] he has fully
[46:09] been
[46:11] showed me in other words i have received
[46:13] a report
[46:16] who gave boaz the report
[46:19] what report
[46:21] let's see he have been fully showed me
[46:24] all that you have done to your
[46:28] mother-in-law
[46:29] since the death of your husband
[46:33] was ruth husband dead in israel or in
[46:37] moab
[46:38] was boaz in moab
[46:41] who told boaz what happened in moab
[46:47] did he have a facebook or a cnn
[46:53] somebody reported what happened
[46:56] in moab who brought the report to boast
[47:00] about something that happened that only
[47:03] naomi and roof knew the story
[47:09] so there is some kind of communication
[47:13] that is underwater
[47:16] going on
[47:18] under current communication that roof is
[47:21] not aware of
[47:22] but it's all working for her amen
[47:26] and how you have left your father and
[47:28] your mother and the land of your
[47:30] nativity and now come to a people which
[47:34] you knew not before
[47:36] everybody care
[47:38] watch now
[47:40] the lord recompense your
[47:43] word
[47:45] your labor
[47:48] may the lord recompense your labor the
[47:50] labor of ruth and the full reward be
[47:54] given you
[47:56] of the lord god of israel
[47:58] under who's what
[48:00] what are the wings of god
[48:03] god have wings
[48:08] in other words whatever you did in the
[48:11] country of board
[48:14] and then what you did to naomi
[48:17] and the decision you took you put
[48:20] yourself
[48:21] under the wing of jehovah
[48:25] you thought you were just talking
[48:27] but spiritually speaking you were
[48:30] entering the wings of jehovah what is
[48:33] the wings of god
[48:37] let's go back to our verse verse 22. and
[48:40] naomi said to ruth her daughter-in-law
[48:43] it is good my daughter that you go out
[48:46] with his maiden that's what they told
[48:48] her
[48:48] how did you know that you were home here
[48:51] you were not there on the field when
[48:53] they told me but you know everything
[48:56] that they meet you not in any other
[48:59] field
[49:00] so naomi's telling her you are put under
[49:03] uh custody here you don't understand
[49:06] they're pretty good make sure you don't
[49:08] mess up here
[49:10] because somebody's watching you there is
[49:12] pies all over
[49:14] amen make sure you do what they told you
[49:16] to do
[49:18] because if they caught you somewhere
[49:21] you're in trouble
[49:22] amen
[49:23] verse 23 so she kept fast by the maidens
[49:27] of boaz to glean to the end of barley
[49:29] harvest and wheat harvest and dwell with
[49:32] her mother in law everybody clear
[49:36] now let's go to matthew chapter three
[49:41] so we understand clear there is two
[49:44] foods ruth has to work until she
[49:47] complete the full harvest she have to
[49:49] work through the wheat hovers and barley
[49:52] harvest in other words the complete
[49:54] circle of harvest must be completed you
[49:57] cannot cut corners
[49:59] you must finish it all the way up amen
[50:02] matthew chapter 3 verse 5 the bible says
[50:06] this then went out to him to john the
[50:08] baptist jerusalem and all judea and all
[50:11] the region around about jordan
[50:13] and we're baptized the laver
[50:16] of him in jordan confessing their sin so
[50:20] you confess your sin at the brazen altar
[50:22] and you get into the liver you baptize
[50:24] amen but when he saw many pharisees and
[50:28] sadducees the religious one come to his
[50:32] baptism he said to them oh generation of
[50:36] vapors
[50:37] who has warned you to flee from the
[50:39] wrath to come
[50:40] bring forth therefore fruit need for
[50:44] water
[50:45] that's what i want you to get repentance
[50:48] doesn't stop just a repentance
[50:52] anybody care
[50:53] repentance is always followed by the
[50:57] fruits
[50:59] of repentance
[51:01] when you repent you are repenting to god
[51:05] america
[51:06] but the fruit this is not only to god
[51:09] even men will see that
[51:11] anybody care so john is telling them you
[51:13] coming here coming to the brazen altar
[51:15] you go into the river everything is okay
[51:18] but i want to see the
[51:20] result i want to see something more than
[51:23] just coming at the brazen altar
[51:25] confessing your sin what follow after
[51:28] amen what kind that life will follow
[51:32] your repentance
[51:34] what kind of fruit what life
[51:37] what works
[51:41] amen what are you doing after you are
[51:44] repented
[51:45] what is your behavior
[51:48] after repenting
[51:51] repenting is good everybody can come to
[51:53] the altar
[51:54] but what follows after so john say you
[51:58] must bring for fruit
[52:00] meat for repentance amen
[52:03] and think not to say
[52:05] within yourself a proud spirit we have
[52:08] abraham to our father you remember
[52:10] yesterday in question and answer
[52:12] jesus told them abraham is not your
[52:14] father your father is the devil amen we
[52:17] have abraham to our father for i say
[52:20] unto you that god is able of this storm
[52:23] to raise up children to her
[52:26] to abraham so don't stay there and say
[52:28] because i was born a jew automatically i
[52:31] have a right no
[52:33] the jew have works
[52:35] everybody here
[52:37] blessed be the name of the lord and now
[52:39] also the axe is laid to the root of the
[52:41] trees therefore every tree which brings
[52:45] not forth water
[52:47] is water
[52:49] and cast into the water so if you got
[52:52] repentance and you never produce fruit
[52:56] or there is not a life that is following
[52:59] your repentance or they are not works
[53:02] that are following your repentance or we
[53:04] cannot see a behavior meet for the
[53:07] repentance
[53:09] they will cut you
[53:12] off you are drinking and you are
[53:16] spending for free you are spilling off
[53:20] this resources of life
[53:22] you don't use it it's not benefiting you
[53:25] let's go to john chapter six then we
[53:28] pray probably i need to read couple more
[53:31] john chapter 6
[53:33] verse 25
[53:35] amen
[53:37] if you dare you can say amen
[53:43] drop for 26 so i can save you some time
[53:46] you already know this from what is there
[53:48] jesus answered them and say
[53:50] verily verily i say to you you seek me
[53:54] not because you saw miracle
[53:56] but because you did eat off the loaves
[54:00] and where what
[54:01] you're following me for not your food
[54:04] for food stamper
[54:08] it's free that's what you're following
[54:11] amen i'm putting that here so you get it
[54:13] quickly verse 27
[54:16] labor not so somebody must labor
[54:19] labor not for the meat which perishes
[54:25] jesus says that man
[54:28] shall not live by what
[54:33] which is natural meat
[54:35] but by every
[54:38] which is spiritual meat
[54:41] anybody care
[54:42] so jesus is telling them do not labor
[54:45] for this
[54:48] don't do it for this
[54:49] don't label for this because this one
[54:53] the
[54:55] the bird of the air they don't work
[55:00] they don't clock in they don't clock out
[55:02] i take care of them
[55:04] they don't wake up with an alarm clock
[55:06] going to work
[55:07] so don't worry about this
[55:09] i know you need it
[55:11] seek ye first there
[55:14] go first here then i will take care of
[55:16] everything later
[55:18] that's why jesus is saying do not label
[55:20] for this
[55:22] don't take all your mind and put it into
[55:26] worldly stuff
[55:29] anybody care
[55:31] but seek that which is eternal i want
[55:34] you to labor right here
[55:37] how do you label
[55:38] amen
[55:40] labor not for the meat which perishes
[55:43] but for that meat which endureth to
[55:45] water
[55:47] so the laboring here will lead you into
[55:51] everlasting life
[55:56] everybody here so before you reach
[55:58] everlasting life you must go through
[56:01] labor
[56:04] you must go through work
[56:07] you must go through serving
[56:10] amen
[56:11] but liberal follow faith
[56:16] everybody here
[56:17] so when you repent you must move to the
[56:20] next stage and labor
[56:23] when you labor it's going to move you to
[56:25] the next stage eternal life
[56:30] blessed be the name of the lord labor
[56:33] not for the meat which perishes but for
[56:35] that meat which endureth to everlasting
[56:38] life which the son of man shall hold
[56:42] not any man can give you that
[56:45] only the son of man
[56:48] it's a personal relationship
[56:51] only the son of man can tell you come up
[56:53] and take it
[56:55] remember john
[56:56] in revelation 10 only the son of man
[56:58] does that amen
[57:00] for him
[57:02] has god the father seal
[57:05] then say that to him
[57:07] what shall we do
[57:09] that we might work
[57:11] the works plural
[57:13] of god
[57:15] yeah tell us we need to stop praying for
[57:17] the sick and they're here we need to
[57:19] start having campaigns go ahead how can
[57:21] we do the work of god how can i speak
[57:23] and then a squirrel come up
[57:26] slow down
[57:27] you are jumping steps
[57:29] before you want to see the squirrel
[57:31] coming up or you speak something happen
[57:33] you must go through a process verse 9 29
[57:37] jesus answered and said to them this is
[57:40] their work singular
[57:43] if you catch this everything else that
[57:46] you're looking for is connected to this
[57:48] this is the work of god that you do what
[57:52] believe on him who has water
[57:56] believe he's speaking about faith
[57:58] but here so when you got your faith your
[58:02] faith has a package
[58:06] of works
[58:09] amen so as soon as that faith is
[58:12] unlocked it will follow automatically
[58:15] into works
[58:16] and those works will lead you into
[58:19] everlasting life
[58:20] that's why brother branham said
[58:22] justification make way to
[58:25] and sanctification makes way too
[58:28] you don't have to worry about it if you
[58:30] did the first step right
[58:32] everybody okay so far
[58:34] let me get these two here on the board
[58:36] then we can pray by god's grace the
[58:39] bible says in psalm chapter 103 verse 2
[58:43] bless the lord o my soul and forget not
[58:46] all his benefit
[58:48] which benefit
[58:49] who forgiveth all that iniquities
[58:53] and heals all the diseases so we can see
[58:56] here that the atonement
[58:59] or the propitiation for our sin have two
[59:03] a compound word amen it works for the
[59:07] forgiveness of your sins
[59:09] and your iniquities
[59:11] amen
[59:12] and he also heals you
[59:16] for the healing every disease
[59:18] anybody care
[59:20] isaiah 53 verse 5 speaking about christ
[59:23] the bible said he was wounded for our
[59:26] transgression the first part there amen
[59:29] he was bruised for hour our iniquity
[59:32] iniquities you know something better but
[59:34] you don't want to do it
[59:36] you need to be in church on time you
[59:38] come late it's inequity everybody
[59:41] he was bruised for our iniquity the
[59:43] chastisement of her peace was upon him
[59:46] and with his trap we are
[59:48] so you cannot have forgiveness of sin or
[59:52] iniquities or transgression anybody care
[59:56] without having healing
[59:59] they all go together
[1:00:02] but here that's why they call god el
[1:00:05] shaddai
[1:00:06] america because el shadda means the
[1:00:09] breasted one there is a breast for your
[1:00:12] forgiveness for your salvation
[1:00:16] amen and there is another breach for
[1:00:18] your healing
[1:00:20] depending on where you want to get it
[1:00:22] amen
[1:00:23] let's go ahead and pray
[1:00:25] heavenly father lord we are approaching
[1:00:27] you again humbly this morning father
[1:00:30] thanking you for your grace for your
[1:00:32] love your mercy and for everything you
[1:00:35] have been doing for us father what a joy
[1:00:38] this morning to gather together with
[1:00:40] families and lord not gathering about
[1:00:43] natural food but gathering for the
[1:00:46] spiritual food because you spoke that
[1:00:48] man shall not live by bread alone but by
[1:00:51] every word
[1:00:52] lord may you move me completely out of
[1:00:55] the way may you come down and speak to
[1:00:57] your children this is as far as i can go
[1:01:00] according to the ability you have given
[1:01:02] us but lord father when it comes to
[1:01:04] opening the word and speaking to your
[1:01:07] children and bless them and bring people
[1:01:09] unto you it only take the supernatural
[1:01:12] action of the holy spirit may your
[1:01:14] anointing come and work among your
[1:01:17] children we humbly ask it we seal
[1:01:20] everything that is contrary to your word
[1:01:22] away from this place and let's that the
[1:01:24] holy spirit and the elect angel only
[1:01:28] continue to work in this building in the
[1:01:30] name of jesus christ
[1:01:32] amen
[1:01:34] god richly bless you on wednesday
[1:01:38] we were on roof
[1:01:41] the four phases of roof
[1:01:43] roof laboring that was part 17 we have
[1:01:46] to change the title so coming back we
[1:01:48] call that part 18 where we are dealing
[1:01:52] with the stable of the showbread amen
[1:01:55] brother branham say roof under
[1:01:57] sanctification
[1:01:59] means roof is laboring
[1:02:02] and she's laboring in the legalistic way
[1:02:06] and we only we already explained to you
[1:02:08] that legalistic is not good but what
[1:02:11] kind of legalistic is brother brown i'm
[1:02:13] talking about amen
[1:02:15] it's a roof resting waiting for boaz to
[1:02:19] return from the finish work
[1:02:21] if roof
[1:02:22] under sanctification is roof laboring
[1:02:25] what does it mean to us
[1:02:28] when we spoke about the tabernacle here
[1:02:31] we begin the teaching on the tabernacle
[1:02:34] and from there we stop and we went to
[1:02:36] the story of roof
[1:02:38] and we took the story and the phases of
[1:02:42] roof in her life and we blended together
[1:02:45] with the tabernacle that's where we got
[1:02:48] roof deciding in the other court roof
[1:02:51] serving in the holy place then roof
[1:02:53] resting in the holiest place amen
[1:02:57] then from there we blended the church
[1:02:59] age messenger
[1:03:01] and we blend the three steps of grace
[1:03:03] which is justification
[1:03:05] sanctification and the baptism of the
[1:03:08] holy spirit we blend the messenger and
[1:03:10] the deviation either you going to looter
[1:03:14] you don't pay attention calvin will suck
[1:03:16] you in if you're going through wesley
[1:03:18] you don't pay attention you're going to
[1:03:20] find yourself in armenianism if you go
[1:03:22] through the message of the hour you
[1:03:24] don't play right you don't uh get
[1:03:26] yourself set up pretty good or robert
[1:03:29] will pull you up
[1:03:30] everybody here then we move on to the
[1:03:33] book of ezekiel and then we inserted the
[1:03:36] three phases of ezekiel according to the
[1:03:39] plan of redemption so all these things
[1:03:42] locked the plan of redemption the
[1:03:45] tabernacle speak about redemption of
[1:03:47] mankind the church ages speak about
[1:03:50] redemption of mankind the step of roof
[1:03:53] speak about a gentile woman a hidden
[1:03:55] that is coming up and becoming part of
[1:03:58] israel which is speaking about the
[1:04:00] redemption again and then bro uh ezekiel
[1:04:03] says that
[1:04:05] god spoke and said i'm gonna give you a
[1:04:07] new heart i'm gonna give you a new
[1:04:09] spirit and i'm gonna give you my spirit
[1:04:12] all of them are in three because god is
[1:04:14] perfected in three everybody clear so
[1:04:17] far so now when ruth
[1:04:20] was coming into israel
[1:04:22] roof was coming under the dispensation
[1:04:25] of the law
[1:04:28] because israel was still under the law
[1:04:31] and paul if you recall spoke and said
[1:04:34] that the law was a school master
[1:04:37] the law was your teacher
[1:04:39] and it was good
[1:04:40] because the law paul said that the law
[1:04:43] was a school master that lead us unto
[1:04:46] christ
[1:04:47] so if you enter the law correctly
[1:04:52] anybody here if you enter the law
[1:04:55] correctly that law will point you to
[1:05:00] christ
[1:05:01] everybody here if you enter the law of
[1:05:05] moses
[1:05:06] and you don't end up in christ you miss
[1:05:09] something
[1:05:11] because moses himself spoke he said the
[1:05:14] lord your god will send you a prophet
[1:05:16] like unto me so moses was pointing the
[1:05:19] people to christ
[1:05:22] the bible says this
[1:05:24] hallelujah that the law
[1:05:27] was given by
[1:05:29] moses
[1:05:31] but grace
[1:05:33] and
[1:05:34] not only grace
[1:05:36] grace
[1:05:39] plus truth
[1:05:41] anybody care
[1:05:43] why truth
[1:05:44] because the bible say you shall not die
[1:05:48] and the truth has set you
[1:05:51] so your freedom comes from the truth
[1:05:56] everybody here so when grace comes grace
[1:06:00] is a company with something that will
[1:06:03] free you
[1:06:06] everybody here
[1:06:08] grace and truth was not given
[1:06:14] grace and truth came
[1:06:20] but here
[1:06:21] the law was given to moses
[1:06:24] so moses was here and somebody came and
[1:06:27] gave moses the lord
[1:06:29] but when it was time for grace and truth
[1:06:33] amen
[1:06:34] amen
[1:06:36] grace and truth came
[1:06:38] in other words grace and truth is a
[1:06:41] person
[1:06:44] [Music]
[1:06:47] everybody here
[1:06:48] jesus said i am the way
[1:06:51] i am the water so the truth is a person
[1:06:56] the grace of god is a person
[1:06:59] hallelujah
[1:07:01] the bible says in john 1 14
[1:07:05] and the word was made
[1:07:07] that's jesus christ and dwelt among us
[1:07:10] and we behead his glory
[1:07:13] the glory of jesus christ the glory has
[1:07:16] the only begotten of the water
[1:07:19] because he came out from god
[1:07:21] i come from god i'm going back to god
[1:07:24] and that son was full of water and full
[1:07:28] of water so you cannot separate jesus
[1:07:31] from grace
[1:07:33] [Applause]
[1:07:36] amen you cannot separate jesus from
[1:07:39] truth
[1:07:40] jesus is the grace of god made flesh
[1:07:43] [Music]
[1:07:44] jesus is the grace of god and the truth
[1:07:48] of god in human form
[1:07:52] ever here so grace is a person of christ
[1:07:58] [Music]
[1:08:00] everybody okay so far
[1:08:02] that's why brother branham said may i
[1:08:04] add to this woman
[1:08:07] her name is water
[1:08:09] because it's the bread of jesus christ
[1:08:12] we are graced because our husband is
[1:08:15] grace
[1:08:16] ever here may i place her in the bible
[1:08:20] also as called the elect lady dismiss
[1:08:24] whatever
[1:08:26] i'm going to talk about you know the
[1:08:27] bible declares said to the elect lady
[1:08:30] and if you notice elect come from the
[1:08:33] word elected lady she was chosen among
[1:08:37] other women
[1:08:39] that's how you do for your brother man
[1:08:41] one lady amongst all other water
[1:08:44] but she was elected
[1:08:47] why is she misgrace because her husband
[1:08:51] is grace
[1:08:52] grace is a person everybody cares so far
[1:08:56] so when
[1:08:57] this grace came
[1:09:00] israel missed it
[1:09:03] israel rejected the grace why
[1:09:07] did israel rejected the grace what
[1:09:09] caused the israel to misgrace because
[1:09:13] the law was a school master to point
[1:09:16] them to christ
[1:09:17] so automatically when jesus come
[1:09:20] everybody that was under the law should
[1:09:23] see him
[1:09:24] but why did they miss him let's go to
[1:09:26] the book of romans
[1:09:28] amen
[1:09:30] hallelujah
[1:09:31] blessed be the name of the lord
[1:09:35] romans chapter 9
[1:09:38] if you dare you can say amen
[1:09:40] if i pass this then i'm soaring quickly
[1:09:44] amen
[1:09:46] roman chapter 9 verse 30. if you dare
[1:09:49] you can say amen
[1:09:52] few people pages are turning
[1:09:55] you can't sleep
[1:09:58] amen
[1:10:00] what shall we say then
[1:10:03] that the gentile or the hidden
[1:10:07] which follow not after righteousness
[1:10:10] have attained to the righteousness even
[1:10:14] the righteousness which is of water
[1:10:17] it seems like the people to whom the law
[1:10:20] came
[1:10:21] miss god
[1:10:25] and the one that did not even have the
[1:10:27] law of god caught god
[1:10:30] but they caught god by faith
[1:10:35] everybody okay
[1:10:36] verse 31 but israel who had the law
[1:10:41] which followed after the law of
[1:10:43] righteousness
[1:10:44] has not attained to the law of
[1:10:47] righteousness in other words israel
[1:10:50] entered with the law but they never
[1:10:52] reached christ
[1:10:54] why
[1:10:55] amen
[1:10:56] they have not attend to the law of
[1:10:59] righteousness verse 32 wherefore in
[1:11:02] other words why what is the reason why
[1:11:04] israel missed god
[1:11:06] amen
[1:11:08] because
[1:11:09] they sought it not by water
[1:11:14] am i reading a different subject
[1:11:17] anybody here so the reason why
[1:11:19] israel never met christ
[1:11:23] when christ came because they lack faith
[1:11:29] amen
[1:11:30] so when you enter the law
[1:11:33] you must enter the law with faith
[1:11:39] faith is revelation
[1:11:41] [Music]
[1:11:48] everybody
[1:11:49] if you enter this message
[1:11:56] you must make sure you have faith
[1:12:04] everybody cares so far
[1:12:05] he says because the the sorted not by
[1:12:10] faith but as it were by what
[1:12:14] they thought by doing something they
[1:12:16] automatically will have what they're
[1:12:18] looking for armenianism
[1:12:24] stumbling stone everybody cares so far
[1:12:27] go to hebrew chapter three
[1:12:31] as we're building
[1:12:32] because we need to understand the labor
[1:12:36] amen
[1:12:38] hebrew chapter 3
[1:12:40] verse 12. if you dare you can say amen
[1:12:44] the bible say take heed
[1:12:47] brethren
[1:12:48] lest there be
[1:12:50] in any of you a what
[1:12:53] an evil heart of what
[1:12:56] unbelief is an evil heart
[1:12:58] unbelief means you don't have faith
[1:13:01] you are under the law but you don't have
[1:13:04] faith
[1:13:05] you are into something but you don't
[1:13:08] really believe what you are in
[1:13:11] [Music]
[1:13:15] everybody here you are born into
[1:13:17] something
[1:13:19] you grew up into something but you
[1:13:21] really don't believe what you born under
[1:13:26] now
[1:13:28] hallelujah
[1:13:29] he says
[1:13:31] that the an evil heart of unbelief in
[1:13:34] departing from the water
[1:13:37] so a proof of somebody that was into
[1:13:41] something
[1:13:42] and did not believe in that which he was
[1:13:47] the result one day
[1:13:49] that person would leave it
[1:13:55] everybody here so when somebody is
[1:13:58] departing from the message
[1:14:00] do not be surprised
[1:14:02] they were in the message but they never
[1:14:05] believed the message
[1:14:12] i won't play games
[1:14:15] verse 13 but i exhort you
[1:14:18] but exalt one another
[1:14:21] daily sorry what it is called today
[1:14:25] lest any of you
[1:14:26] be hardened through the deceitful of sin
[1:14:31] for we are mad partakers of christ
[1:14:34] if we hold yes brother
[1:14:37] if we hold the beginning of our
[1:14:41] confidence
[1:14:42] steadfast to the water
[1:14:46] everybody here
[1:14:48] if you enter into the holiest can you
[1:14:50] come out again
[1:14:52] if you come out it means you never was
[1:14:54] there
[1:14:57] anybody here so if you start with christ
[1:15:00] you don't come out
[1:15:02] if you coming out it means you never got
[1:15:05] into the same place
[1:15:06] you thought you were in it you were in
[1:15:09] something else
[1:15:10] but you were not in christ anybody cared
[1:15:12] so far
[1:15:13] the bible says in verse 15
[1:15:16] while it is said today
[1:15:19] jump to verse 16 so i can uh gain some
[1:15:22] time
[1:15:23] for some not everybody
[1:15:26] when they had heard
[1:15:28] did provoke
[1:15:30] however
[1:15:31] not all that came out of egypt
[1:15:35] by who
[1:15:36] so when moses police were here
[1:15:40] many people came out 2 million
[1:15:42] if you look you say wow this is a big
[1:15:45] church
[1:15:46] a lot of believers
[1:15:51] watch out
[1:15:52] because none of uh the majority of them
[1:15:55] never made it to the promised land
[1:15:59] but they were following a prophet
[1:16:02] they were eating the manner every day
[1:16:05] but they miss the promised land
[1:16:07] what makes them miss the promised land
[1:16:09] while they were under the anointing of
[1:16:11] god following god what happened
[1:16:15] anybody here
[1:16:17] verse
[1:16:19] 17 but with whom
[1:16:22] was god was he grieved 40 years
[1:16:25] so 40 years god is grieved
[1:16:27] jesus the people that he brought out
[1:16:30] amen
[1:16:31] was he grieved
[1:16:33] for years was he not with them that had
[1:16:37] seen
[1:16:38] whose carcass their bodies fell into the
[1:16:41] wilderness
[1:16:42] and to whom
[1:16:43] saw he that they should not enter into
[1:16:46] his water
[1:16:48] but remember roof resting
[1:16:51] but to them that believe what
[1:16:55] so somebody followed moses
[1:16:57] but he did not believe moses
[1:17:02] everybody here
[1:17:04] so
[1:17:05] verse 19
[1:17:06] we see that they could not enter because
[1:17:09] of water
[1:17:11] everybody
[1:17:13] drop down to verse chapter four
[1:17:17] verse one
[1:17:18] let us therefore fear paul is showing
[1:17:21] you an example he said now be careful
[1:17:24] look what happened to israel you also be
[1:17:26] careful be careful of what let us
[1:17:29] therefore feel
[1:17:30] less the promise being left of us of
[1:17:33] entering into his rest
[1:17:35] any of you should seem to come short of
[1:17:38] it i don't want anybody to miss the step
[1:17:40] of roof resting
[1:17:43] but i have to show you what made the
[1:17:45] other miss that step
[1:17:47] because they never believed into what
[1:17:50] they got into
[1:17:52] amen
[1:17:53] verse two fought to us
[1:17:56] was the gospel preached
[1:17:58] as well as to water
[1:18:01] so they were going to church
[1:18:05] they were going to church on wednesday
[1:18:07] they heard moses preach they went to
[1:18:09] church on sunday they went to church on
[1:18:11] thursday moses was preaching to them
[1:18:15] some were even taking notes
[1:18:18] some were sleeping in church
[1:18:21] some as soon as they say moses is
[1:18:22] calling the congregation again
[1:18:28] everybody here some when they say moses
[1:18:30] is calling the people no i need to wash
[1:18:32] my clothing today
[1:18:34] so i cannot make it today
[1:18:38] nothing is new everybody here
[1:18:41] he continued he said
[1:18:43] but the word preach
[1:18:46] even though they heard it
[1:18:48] did not profit them
[1:18:51] why did the word did not profit them
[1:18:54] not being mixed with water
[1:18:57] in them that eat water so when you
[1:19:00] listening to the word of god that word
[1:19:03] of god must be mixed by faith
[1:19:06] if it's meets my faith
[1:19:08] automatically it will lead you to jesus
[1:19:10] christ
[1:19:13] [Music]
[1:19:14] what are you saying my brother this is
[1:19:17] what i'm saying
[1:19:18] jesus said
[1:19:20] do not think that i
[1:19:22] jesus i will accuse you to the father
[1:19:27] there is one that accuses you
[1:19:30] even who
[1:19:31] in whom you do what so when moses is in
[1:19:34] heaven and you are there you say we
[1:19:37] follow moses moses said no no no no that
[1:19:39] was not me
[1:19:41] this is not what i told them to do
[1:19:45] [Applause]
[1:19:47] instead of moses talking for you moses
[1:19:50] is actually rebuking you in heaven
[1:19:54] everybody okay
[1:19:56] for
[1:19:57] he had he believed
[1:20:06] [Music]
[1:20:10] did he say have you believed the lord
[1:20:15] [Music]
[1:20:20] he said have you believed the law
[1:20:23] does it mean we are worshipping moses
[1:20:28] when they say moses they're talking
[1:20:30] about the law of moses
[1:20:33] so when they say believe moses that's
[1:20:35] why paul told king agrippa do you
[1:20:38] believe the prophet
[1:20:43] so when we say believing brother branham
[1:20:47] we're not talking about the man brother
[1:20:49] branham we're talking about the message
[1:20:52] that was brought through brother branham
[1:20:56] [Applause]
[1:21:01] because brother branham was a man
[1:21:04] brother branham was a prophet moses was
[1:21:07] a man and moses was a prophet but you
[1:21:10] must believe moses
[1:21:12] you cannot separate the man from his
[1:21:16] message
[1:21:17] the message and the messenger are one
[1:21:20] and the same
[1:21:26] [Applause]
[1:21:29] everybody okay
[1:21:30] everybody okay
[1:21:31] you must believe jesus say if you
[1:21:34] believe on whom i sent
[1:21:37] so if god sent somebody you must believe
[1:21:40] that person that person is not god
[1:21:44] you believe in god send him
[1:21:46] and you get the instruction
[1:21:49] that god gave to that person and you
[1:21:51] continue your journey
[1:21:54] [Applause]
[1:21:54] [Music]
[1:21:56] so we're not worshiping brother branham
[1:21:59] but we believe the message of brother
[1:22:02] branham
[1:22:04] because the message is lined up with the
[1:22:06] bible
[1:22:08] so it's no more a man but it's god
[1:22:11] who spoke to this generation
[1:22:18] i'm sorry i gave you vaccine i'm putting
[1:22:21] boosters
[1:22:24] [Laughter]
[1:22:27] for ye have been for had you believe who
[1:22:32] you would have believed water
[1:22:39] so you cannot say
[1:22:42] you believe jesus christ if you didn't
[1:22:45] believe moses
[1:22:48] because moses was the law and the law
[1:22:52] was pointing you to who
[1:22:55] so if you miss jesus it means you never
[1:22:58] even believe moses
[1:23:00] [Applause]
[1:23:06] amen
[1:23:07] he would have believed me for he did
[1:23:10] what
[1:23:14] [Music]
[1:23:17] moses did water
[1:23:24] everybody here in other words moses gave
[1:23:27] you the written word
[1:23:34] anybody here
[1:23:36] that's why israel was going in the
[1:23:38] sabbath and the bible said in the book
[1:23:40] of acts that moses was preached
[1:23:44] you remember i gave you the scripture
[1:23:46] every sabbath so on the sabbath they
[1:23:48] open the bible
[1:23:50] and they read like this they say moses
[1:23:52] say moses say moses said moses and
[1:23:55] israel say amen
[1:23:58] not amen to moses
[1:24:00] amen to the written word of moses
[1:24:04] everybody okay so far everybody okay so
[1:24:06] far so the proof
[1:24:11] that you believe the written word
[1:24:16] is when you can reveal is when you can
[1:24:19] receive the manifested word
[1:24:24] [Applause]
[1:24:25] [Music]
[1:24:27] i'm reading the bible let me read it
[1:24:30] again
[1:24:32] but
[1:24:33] if you believe not his what
[1:24:36] the writing of who
[1:24:38] if you don't believe if you don't
[1:24:40] believe the written word if you don't
[1:24:44] believe the bible
[1:24:46] everybody okay
[1:24:47] how shall he believe my
[1:24:50] because jesus was the word made flesh
[1:24:56] everybody here so when you are rejecting
[1:24:59] the word made flesh
[1:25:01] yes
[1:25:02] but here you are automatically rejecting
[1:25:06] the bible
[1:25:12] you cannot be a bible believer
[1:25:16] and rejecting the word made flesh
[1:25:19] the proof that you really believe the
[1:25:21] bible is when you
[1:25:23] when you accept the manifested word of
[1:25:26] god
[1:25:27] that means you already believe the
[1:25:29] scripture because the bible will point
[1:25:32] you to the word man's flesh
[1:25:37] [Applause]
[1:25:40] everybody here
[1:25:42] everybody here
[1:25:43] because when he came he did what moses
[1:25:45] spoke of him
[1:25:48] ever here so you cannot reject jesus
[1:25:51] christ and you say no i believe the word
[1:25:54] i believe jehovah
[1:25:58] you don't even believe jehovah
[1:26:00] you don't believe jehovah if you believe
[1:26:02] jehovah
[1:26:03] if you really believe jehovah when you
[1:26:06] see jesus christ you will recognize
[1:26:09] jesus christ that oh the jehovah of the
[1:26:12] old testament that's him right here
[1:26:15] [Applause]
[1:26:15] [Music]
[1:26:18] [Applause]
[1:26:21] hallelujah
[1:26:22] hallelujah so the law was good
[1:26:28] the law was a problem
[1:26:30] when it's followed without faith
[1:26:34] then it becomes a burden
[1:26:37] if the message is a burden for you
[1:26:40] [Music]
[1:26:43] but here it means you have not gotten
[1:26:46] the revelation yet
[1:26:48] that's why you feel like a prisoner
[1:26:50] or they say don't do this they say they
[1:26:52] don't do this they don't touch you they
[1:26:54] don't wear this they don't wear this
[1:26:55] it's not really that
[1:26:58] the day you're going to receive the
[1:26:59] revelation that all that god is telling
[1:27:02] you is the law and the prophet all of
[1:27:05] them are in one commandment you shall
[1:27:08] love the god the lord your god then
[1:27:11] everything is no more a law anymore
[1:27:14] then it leads you to christ
[1:27:17] lord
[1:27:18] paul say is holy
[1:27:22] and the commandments are holy and just
[1:27:25] and what
[1:27:27] it is the behavior of israel
[1:27:30] that made the lord look like he was bad
[1:27:34] for we know that the law
[1:27:36] is spiritual
[1:27:38] but i am colonel showed under sin
[1:27:43] david says this
[1:27:44] the law of the lord is perfect
[1:27:48] converting what
[1:27:50] how can someone love the law and another
[1:27:53] one doesn't love the law
[1:27:56] for someone the law is something perfect
[1:27:58] for somebody else the law is a prison
[1:28:02] the testimonies
[1:28:04] the testimony of the lord is sure
[1:28:07] making wise the simple
[1:28:10] the statutes
[1:28:11] of the lord are right doing what
[1:28:17] so when they were reading the law
[1:28:19] the heart of david was rejoicing
[1:28:23] when they were reading the law somebody
[1:28:26] else was again
[1:28:30] yeah do and don't
[1:28:32] yeah when i'm going there they're going
[1:28:34] to tell me what something bad i did but
[1:28:36] when they tell david david say praise
[1:28:38] the lord thank you jesus
[1:28:41] everybody here he said the commandment
[1:28:43] of the lord is water
[1:28:45] enlightening the water
[1:28:47] it's opening your eyes to the things you
[1:28:50] never knew before
[1:28:52] but here the fear of the lord is clean
[1:28:55] enduring forever the judgment of the
[1:28:58] lord are true and righteous all water
[1:29:04] this law that is good
[1:29:06] this law that is pure
[1:29:08] this law that is holy was only one law
[1:29:12] for everybody
[1:29:15] exodus chapter 12 the bible say
[1:29:19] when a stranger
[1:29:21] shall join with thee not an israelite
[1:29:26] and will keep the passover to the lord
[1:29:30] let all his smell be water
[1:29:34] and then let him come near and keep it
[1:29:37] and he shall be
[1:29:39] as one that is water
[1:29:42] so when you get circumcised
[1:29:47] everybody okay
[1:29:49] everybody okay
[1:29:51] automatically you receive the passport
[1:29:55] the citizenship
[1:29:56] of israel
[1:30:00] ever here when you are circumcised there
[1:30:03] is no difference anymore between you
[1:30:07] and a jew even if you're outside look
[1:30:10] different than a jew
[1:30:14] hallelujah
[1:30:17] and it shall be as one that is born in
[1:30:21] the land
[1:30:22] for not on circumcised
[1:30:25] persons shall water
[1:30:27] so even if you are a jew and you are
[1:30:30] born in israel if you are not
[1:30:32] circumcised even though you are a jew
[1:30:36] you cannot approach god
[1:30:37] [Applause]
[1:30:41] so approaching god
[1:30:43] is not based on where you are born
[1:30:49] approaching god is based on the
[1:30:52] circumcision
[1:30:54] and paul spoke about the circumcision of
[1:30:57] the heart
[1:30:58] [Music]
[1:31:01] let me continue
[1:31:03] two laws
[1:31:06] one law shall be to him that is
[1:31:11] and unto the water
[1:31:13] that's a journey among so whether you
[1:31:16] are born in israel
[1:31:21] oh you are not born in israel there is
[1:31:24] only one law
[1:31:27] whether you are born in a message
[1:31:33] oh you are not born in a message
[1:31:35] you only have one line
[1:31:39] [Music]
[1:31:42] hallelujah leviticus 24 22 you shall
[1:31:47] have
[1:31:48] one manner of law
[1:31:50] as well further
[1:31:52] as for one of your own
[1:31:55] so when roof was moving to israel
[1:32:00] she cannot use a different law
[1:32:06] one law everybody okay
[1:32:08] the bible continues one ordinance shall
[1:32:12] be buffed for your congregate for you of
[1:32:15] the congregation and also for the
[1:32:17] stranger that's a journey with you an
[1:32:20] ordinance forever
[1:32:23] in your generation as year so shall they
[1:32:27] stranger be before
[1:32:29] no distinction so through the law
[1:32:32] already
[1:32:33] god was showing israel that he was the
[1:32:36] god of everybody
[1:32:38] [Music]
[1:32:39] israel missed it
[1:32:41] everybody care
[1:32:42] one love and one man shall be for you
[1:32:46] and for the stranger that's a joy with
[1:32:49] you not different lord that's why we say
[1:32:52] that whether you are born in the message
[1:32:57] oh you are not born in a message there
[1:33:00] is only one door
[1:33:03] and usually the problem is with the one
[1:33:05] born in a message
[1:33:08] the problem is usually with the jew
[1:33:11] because paul say the gentiles who were
[1:33:14] not looking for jesus christ found him
[1:33:17] but the jew that were born in the law
[1:33:20] they're the one that rejected him
[1:33:24] ever here paul was born in the law
[1:33:27] taught in the law and he found himself
[1:33:30] crucifying the word made flesh
[1:33:32] and paul said that he was the chief
[1:33:34] sinner hallelujah brother branham said
[1:33:37] the legalist got a hold of this idea
[1:33:41] hallelujah i shall wear my dress down
[1:33:44] this way and my dress down this way i
[1:33:47] shall let my hair grow long i shall be
[1:33:49] all right that's a lie
[1:33:56] and they point back to the woman with
[1:33:58] short hair
[1:33:59] and with short dresses and say she's
[1:34:02] going to hell because she was born in
[1:34:05] the message
[1:34:08] because she was born in israel she can
[1:34:11] say that's a more british woman
[1:34:14] everybody here
[1:34:15] i can't say that
[1:34:17] but i think those things are water
[1:34:21] so dressing with your dress down it's
[1:34:24] good
[1:34:26] keeping your hair long it's good
[1:34:29] i'm not condemning them but when you
[1:34:32] rest your eternal hopes
[1:34:35] and salvation upon that doctrine
[1:34:38] you are damned with it
[1:34:44] dressing with long dresses keeping your
[1:34:47] hair
[1:34:48] is the result
[1:34:51] that will follow later
[1:34:57] you don't start with the result
[1:35:00] and you're missing faith
[1:35:02] [Music]
[1:35:06] then your labor you are the one doing
[1:35:09] the label
[1:35:11] it is not god doing the label that's why
[1:35:13] it's hard for you
[1:35:17] that's why the message is hard
[1:35:19] because you're doing work everybody here
[1:35:21] the man or woman it doesn't matter
[1:35:24] whether you are this that or the other
[1:35:27] you come to that fountain
[1:35:29] filled with blood
[1:35:31] drawn from emmanuels
[1:35:33] and let the purgative of the blood of
[1:35:36] jesus christ do what
[1:35:38] in other words start first with
[1:35:40] repentance
[1:35:45] everybody okay
[1:35:47] what about him say men and women can go
[1:35:50] to church
[1:35:51] and have long faith and pious as they
[1:35:55] can be and never lie
[1:35:58] the jews never steal the jews and try to
[1:36:01] live to there
[1:36:03] like paul as best as they can but unless
[1:36:07] they are water
[1:36:09] because we found israel following moses
[1:36:12] but they were not believing moses
[1:36:18] but they were living according to the
[1:36:21] custom of the jew
[1:36:23] so those customs they were doing that by
[1:36:26] work not by revelation
[1:36:30] i hope you can clearly see where you are
[1:36:33] everybody here
[1:36:34] but unless they are a believer they are
[1:36:39] so there is no scratch of legalists in
[1:36:42] the bible
[1:36:45] not a scratch of it
[1:36:47] anybody here that's why the door is
[1:36:50] always at the cross
[1:36:55] that's why you hear at the cross at the
[1:36:57] cross where i face
[1:37:00] and the burden of my heart
[1:37:04] he was there by faith i received my son
[1:37:09] and now i am happy
[1:37:14] [Music]
[1:37:14] [Applause]
[1:37:20] here now you're going on your journey
[1:37:22] all the way
[1:37:23] everybody cares so far
[1:37:25] so
[1:37:28] i'm good in time
[1:37:30] i'm just sorry amen so
[1:37:34] the decision that roof took
[1:37:37] for leaving her country everybody here i
[1:37:41] wrote it somewhere here leaving her
[1:37:43] country
[1:37:45] boaz when he met roof boa said
[1:37:49] that
[1:37:49] what you did when you were over there
[1:37:52] you put yourself
[1:37:54] under the wing of who
[1:37:57] because roof say
[1:38:00] your people
[1:38:02] will be
[1:38:04] in other words i'm no more more about
[1:38:06] i am a jew
[1:38:08] your nation
[1:38:10] will be
[1:38:12] i'm no more moabite i'm an israelite and
[1:38:15] your god
[1:38:17] everybody here will also be
[1:38:20] in other words wolf completely turned
[1:38:23] away her first nation
[1:38:25] and move into the next nation and that
[1:38:28] decision board says you put yourself
[1:38:33] under the water
[1:38:35] what does it mean the wings of god
[1:38:40] brother uh
[1:38:41] uh david says this in psalm 61
[1:38:45] i will abide in that word
[1:38:51] everybody okay
[1:38:54] forever
[1:38:56] i would trust in the coverage of water
[1:39:01] so the tub and alcohol is water
[1:39:10] everybody here so the tabernacle of god
[1:39:14] is the wings of god
[1:39:19] so boys were telling ruth that the
[1:39:23] decision you took over there you were
[1:39:25] already entering the tabernacle
[1:39:28] [Music]
[1:39:32] that's why roof deciding was already
[1:39:35] roofed the
[1:39:38] president have brother branham gave you
[1:39:41] that scripture
[1:39:42] the message is always
[1:39:46] everybody here so when the roof was
[1:39:49] saying hey
[1:39:50] your people will be my people your god
[1:39:52] will be my god she already entered the
[1:39:55] tabernacle and she went into the brazen
[1:39:58] altar she took decision she stripped
[1:40:00] herself off from her first nation now
[1:40:03] she's moving to the
[1:40:05] and when she meet boaz boaz acknowledge
[1:40:07] first to her faith
[1:40:10] that i know everybody here now watch
[1:40:13] since she put herself in the tabernacle
[1:40:16] when she was coming
[1:40:18] back to israel with naomi now me begin
[1:40:22] to teach her the law
[1:40:25] anybody here
[1:40:27] naomi begin to teach her the law because
[1:40:30] the law is important
[1:40:34] amen it will it's a school master that
[1:40:37] will lead you to who
[1:40:39] which is our powers
[1:40:41] anybody here
[1:40:42] but the only way
[1:40:44] the law will bring you to boaz
[1:40:48] you must mix that lord with faith
[1:40:53] everybody okay so far so when roof begin
[1:40:57] to heal the word of god like israel was
[1:41:00] listening to the gospel
[1:41:03] into the wilderness
[1:41:04] roof heard the word with faith
[1:41:07] when naomi said when you get there we
[1:41:10] got food stamp in israel when you get in
[1:41:13] israel and you don't have food at home
[1:41:15] which i don't know if i'm gonna find
[1:41:16] something at home god gave us a law you
[1:41:19] can go to any field you will go ahead
[1:41:22] and reap and you can do everything
[1:41:24] nobody's going to bother you he'll be
[1:41:25] okay who read all of her
[1:41:28] she heard it she was coming and in roof
[1:41:31] chapter 2 ruth woke up in the morning
[1:41:34] it was not naomi
[1:41:36] that thought groove go to there
[1:41:39] amen
[1:41:40] roof order medically
[1:41:43] knowing the law everybody here moving by
[1:41:47] work
[1:41:49] everybody okay because her love was
[1:41:52] mixed by faith
[1:41:54] and automatically in that same day she
[1:41:57] met boaz
[1:41:58] because the law when it's mixed by faith
[1:42:02] will automatically point you to who
[1:42:06] everybody okay so far
[1:42:08] automatically that law will strike will
[1:42:11] will it'll take you straight ahead and
[1:42:13] put you there
[1:42:15] david says this in psalm 91 he said he
[1:42:19] that dwelleth
[1:42:20] in the secret water
[1:42:24] of the water
[1:42:26] what is the secret place of the monster
[1:42:32] everybody okay he was in the tabernacle
[1:42:35] everybody here shall abide under the
[1:42:38] shadow of the almighty i will say of the
[1:42:41] lord he is my
[1:42:43] and my
[1:42:44] that's why boaz was protecting her
[1:42:47] my god in him will i trust
[1:42:50] surely he shall deliver me from the
[1:42:53] snare of them

[1:43:21] is moving by the law automatically she's
[1:43:26] entering the second stage which is roof
[1:43:28] serving
[1:43:29] and brother branham said roof serving
[1:43:32] means roof under sanctification
[1:43:36] which means roof is laboring

[1:44:30] if you don't mind
[1:44:32] we're talking about roof under
[1:44:34] sanctification
[1:44:36] why sanctification
[1:44:39] wire
[1:44:42] go first to exodus
[1:44:44] so we get this
[1:44:47] then it's going to load a solid
[1:44:49] foundation then we can come out of it go
[1:44:52] to exodus 28 first
[1:44:55] if you don't mind
[1:44:58] exodus 28 36
[1:45:00] why sanctification
[1:45:03] if you're there you can say amen
[1:45:05] exodus
[1:45:06] 28
[1:45:08] 30
[1:45:10] 36
[1:45:11] everybody here
[1:45:13] and you shall make a plate
[1:45:16] of pure gold
[1:45:18] and grave upon it
[1:45:21] like the engraving of a signet
[1:45:25] what do you place upon it
[1:45:28] you know what it means
[1:45:31] holiness to the
[1:45:33] sanctification to the
[1:45:36] god told israel told moses
[1:45:39] i want you to make a mature
[1:45:42] or a hat
[1:45:43] for the high priest
[1:45:45] anybody here when you're making that
[1:45:48] take a plate of pure gold
[1:45:51] right on that plate
[1:45:53] holiness unto the lord in other words
[1:45:55] sanctification unto the lord amen and
[1:45:58] take that and put it
[1:46:00] verse 37 and you shall put it on the
[1:46:04] blue lace
[1:46:05] i'm going to stay away from these
[1:46:07] that it may be
[1:46:08] upon the middle
[1:46:10] or the turban
[1:46:11] upon the forefront
[1:46:14] of the meter
[1:46:15] it shall be so you put it on the
[1:46:17] forehead
[1:46:18] on the forefront here
[1:46:19] so when the high priest goes
[1:46:21] all you see is holiness to the lord
[1:46:24] holiness to the lord when you're talking
[1:46:26] to the high priest
[1:46:29] why
[1:46:31] amen verse 20 38 and it shall be upon
[1:46:35] aaron's what
[1:46:38] brother branham said the forehead means
[1:46:41] the revelation
[1:46:43] and what i'm saying in another place the
[1:46:45] forehead means the knowledge
[1:46:48] anybody care
[1:46:49] it shall be upon aaron's forehead
[1:46:53] that aaron
[1:46:54] may bear
[1:46:56] the iniquity of the holy things which
[1:46:59] the children of israel shall hallow in
[1:47:02] all
[1:47:03] in all their holy gift
[1:47:06] and it shall be always
[1:47:09] upon his water
[1:47:12] that
[1:47:12] they may be accepted before who
[1:47:16] so if the offering of israel
[1:47:19] have to be accepted aaron every day he's
[1:47:24] approaching with the offering
[1:47:26] he must put
[1:47:27] something right here
[1:47:29] that reminds him
[1:47:31] that holiness
[1:47:33] unto the lord
[1:47:35] so
[1:47:36] when aaron we know that the priests were
[1:47:39] entering in the tabernacle only on the
[1:47:44] first and the second
[1:47:46] anybody here
[1:47:47] nobody could enter the holiest on me the
[1:47:50] high priest
[1:47:52] god said take a hat
[1:47:54] put it on the high priest
[1:47:56] make sure there is a plate that goes on
[1:47:58] his forehead
[1:47:59] where his memory is
[1:48:01] where his mind is where his knowledge is
[1:48:06] amen and put upon that holiness unto the
[1:48:10] lord because he's the only one
[1:48:13] that can cross into the holiest
[1:48:17] ever here and before you enter in the
[1:48:20] holiest i want you to remember aaron
[1:48:24] you do not enter here without holiness
[1:48:29] you cannot enter here without
[1:48:32] sanctification
[1:48:36] you don't come in here any kind of way
[1:48:40] amen when you are approaching me i need
[1:48:43] to see in your mind that you talked
[1:48:45] about repenting you thought about
[1:48:48] cleaning up your life you thought about
[1:48:50] stripping everything that is bad before
[1:48:52] me and you meet face to face
[1:48:56] you okay now now let's go to first
[1:48:58] thessalonians
[1:49:01] i just want you to get that
[1:49:07] let's go to first thessalonians chapter
[1:49:09] 4 now hallelujah
[1:49:13] blessed be the name of the lord
[1:49:16] don't worry i'm already up i will let
[1:49:18] you take off your seat belt soon
[1:49:22] first thessalonians chapter
[1:49:24] four if you there you can say amen
[1:49:27] first one you there
[1:49:31] i thought i have it and then i flip on
[1:49:33] the wrong one amen
[1:49:36] furthermore then we beseech you brethren
[1:49:39] and exalt you by the lord jesus that as
[1:49:43] you have received of us
[1:49:45] how you ought to do what
[1:49:48] and to do what
[1:49:50] this work is a work to please god
[1:49:56] anybody here
[1:49:58] and without faith can you please god
[1:50:02] anybody okay so far it is a walk
[1:50:06] a walk that you might please god
[1:50:11] amen
[1:50:12] and with that faith
[1:50:14] you cannot please god
[1:50:16] so automatically we can see which work
[1:50:19] it is
[1:50:20] it's a work of faith
[1:50:22] to water so this work cannot happen
[1:50:26] without faith
[1:50:29] you have faith first
[1:50:31] then you start walking
[1:50:33] because faith works is faith what
[1:50:37] praise god he says
[1:50:39] so you would have burned
[1:50:41] more and water
[1:50:43] so the more you walking
[1:50:45] pleasing the lord what happened to your
[1:50:48] life
[1:50:49] you begin to
[1:50:51] more and water
[1:50:55] what kind of work is this
[1:50:58] verse 2
[1:50:59] for you know
[1:51:01] what commandment we gave you by the lord
[1:51:04] jesus

[1:51:09] the will of god what is the will of god
[1:51:12] are you reading amen this is the will of
[1:51:15] god camera

[1:51:18] i want you to be sanctified
[1:51:22] god wants you to be sanctified
[1:51:25] holiness unto me
[1:51:27] because the caribbeans that are there
[1:51:30] they always sing holy holy holy unto the
[1:51:33] lord
[1:51:34] so you don't enter like that
[1:51:37] ever here
[1:51:39] this is the will of god even your
[1:51:42] sanctification that you should abstain
[1:51:45] from
[1:51:46] fornication
[1:51:48] that every one of you should know how to
[1:51:52] possess his vessels or his body
[1:51:55] in sanctification and water
[1:51:59] everybody okay
[1:52:01] verse five
[1:52:02] not in the lust of concupiscence or
[1:52:05] passion even as there
[1:52:08] which no not what
[1:52:10] you were gentle before
[1:52:12] do not walk anymore like the denture you
[1:52:16] need to work now a different work

[1:52:22] and a clean walk
[1:52:24] anybody here

[1:52:29] brother in any manner that's what you
[1:52:31] were doing before you came to christ
[1:52:33] because that the lord is the avenger of
[1:52:36] all such as we also have forewarned you
[1:52:39] and testify for god has not called us
[1:52:44] unto
[1:52:46] but to water
[1:52:49] at the present altar god doesn't care
[1:52:53] much on the outside

[1:55:17] better
[1:55:18] you did it in ignorance now that you
[1:55:21] know the truth that the way you were
[1:55:23] treating your wife was bad the way you
[1:55:25] were
[1:55:26] what uh treating your husband was bad

[1:55:56] so be what
[1:55:59] in all manners of what
[1:56:02] god cannot ask you to do something
[1:56:05] without him making a way for you to do
[1:56:08] it
[1:56:08] [Music]
[1:56:11] everybody here when god asks you to do
[1:56:14] something in you there is already a
[1:56:16] power
[1:56:17] to do it
[1:56:19] the problem is the self-will
[1:56:22] it is you surrendering your will
[1:56:25] to his will then your work take over
[1:56:30] come on let's go
[1:56:31] he said but as he which call you he is
[1:56:35] so be he what
[1:56:37] he is holy he must connect with somebody
[1:56:39] who is holy that's why you need to clean
[1:56:42] up everybody here in all manners of
[1:56:44] conversation because it's rising be ye
[1:56:49] for i am what
[1:56:50] how can we be holy
[1:56:53] amen
[1:56:55] follow peace with all men and water
[1:56:59] with that
[1:57:01] no one should water
[1:57:03] you cannot see the god here
[1:57:06] in the holiest
[1:57:07] if you are not holy
[1:57:09] even the high priest have to remind
[1:57:12] himself that i must clean up before i
[1:57:15] see him because no one can see me
[1:57:17] without holy
[1:57:19] ever here
[1:57:20] what is holiness and how do you get it
[1:57:25] let's get it now amen
[1:57:28] in mark chapter 12
[1:57:31] we remember if you remember this
[1:57:33] they asked jesus what is the greatest
[1:57:36] commandment
[1:57:37] jesus said love your god with all your
[1:57:39] heart all your strength you know that
[1:57:42] and love your neighbor as yourself
[1:57:44] and that person replied
[1:57:47] this is what he replied he said to love
[1:57:50] him with all the heart
[1:57:52] without the understanding we fought the
[1:57:54] soul we fought the strength and to love
[1:57:57] his neighbor as himself
[1:57:58] is more than the whole
[1:58:01] burnt offering and what
[1:58:04] which was done under the law
[1:58:06] anybody okay
[1:58:08] if you notice this man pointed the law
[1:58:13] he says if you love god
[1:58:15] more than anything and you love your
[1:58:18] brother
[1:58:20] automatically it is more important than
[1:58:23] the gift that you give him because you
[1:58:25] can give a gift by routine
[1:58:29] by just religion
[1:58:30] this is what we normally do
[1:58:34] we give offering we give that we go to
[1:58:36] church we sing we dance we come out we
[1:58:39] live any kind of life
[1:58:42] do you really love the one you're
[1:58:43] serving
[1:58:44] that's a different story
[1:58:47] you can bring a lamb
[1:58:48] but you mad at your wife
[1:58:51] and you sacrifice the lamb and you go
[1:58:53] the same person you don't change you go
[1:58:55] back again abusing again at home
[1:58:58] anybody here
[1:59:00] look at jesus saying and when jesus saw
[1:59:03] that he answered this quickly he said
[1:59:06] unto him there are nothing
[1:59:09] from water
[1:59:11] you are pretty close here
[1:59:14] you almost
[1:59:15] about to enter
[1:59:18] you ride at the door right here
[1:59:20] if you answer like that you understand
[1:59:22] you have a revelation of the law now
[1:59:25] what does it mean sacrifice an offering
[1:59:29] in the book of samuel
[1:59:31] god todd so go
[1:59:34] to the america kill everything
[1:59:38] saul went and he did his own thing
[1:59:41] and he came back
[1:59:42] and the prophet came and said so
[1:59:44] did you do what god told you to do he
[1:59:46] said yes i did it amen oh my brother
[1:59:49] they were so good we slayed those
[1:59:52] amalekites we killed them the meeting
[1:59:54] was so good young people went to the
[1:59:57] altar he was so yummy everything was
[2:00:00] good the food was good the fellowship
[2:00:02] was good and samuel just waited
[2:00:05] when he finished he said
[2:00:07] i'm hearing some buzzing
[2:00:10] on the internet tonight
[2:00:12] [Music]
[2:00:15] no i was i was listening to the tape
[2:00:19] really were you listening to the table
[2:00:23] why did you do this
[2:00:25] oh no the people told me we can get the
[2:00:28] sacrifice to sacrifice to the lord
[2:00:30] [Music]
[2:00:32] god say kill them all
[2:00:35] do you think god didn't see that those
[2:00:38] those
[2:00:39] calves were
[2:00:40] beautiful and healthy
[2:00:44] and samuel rose up and say listen to me
[2:00:46] carefully
[2:00:48] has the lord a great delight in water
[2:00:53] and what
[2:00:54] is more than the whole
[2:00:58] and what
[2:01:00] you okay
[2:01:01] that's what that man caught
[2:01:03] anybody here
[2:01:05] has the lord as great delight in burnt
[2:01:08] offering and sacrifice as in water
[2:01:12] [Music]
[2:01:14] children of obedience
[2:01:19] anybody care
[2:01:21] obedience
[2:01:23] everybody here roof stay here
[2:01:27] i'm not restricting you
[2:01:30] there will come a time you're going to
[2:01:32] shop around all these are you i want to
[2:01:34] see something i want to test and see
[2:01:38] if i tell you to walk this way if you're
[2:01:40] going to do it or not
[2:01:42] everybody here
[2:01:43] he said as obeying the voice of the lord
[2:01:47] behold to obey
[2:01:50] is better than what
[2:01:53] and to hearken to listen
[2:01:55] then the father no water
[2:01:58] all god is answering you instead of
[2:02:01] focusing on how much a calf cost how
[2:02:04] many calf do i need where can i find the
[2:02:07] healthy one i'm tired of buying this
[2:02:09] calf i just want you to do one thing if
[2:02:12] you can obey
[2:02:15] and if you can hearken
[2:02:17] or if you can listen
[2:02:20] that's all i require on you so
[2:02:24] it was not really killing the animal
[2:02:27] i just wanted to see if when i tell you
[2:02:29] something you're gonna do it exactly the
[2:02:32] way i did it
[2:02:34] i had a plan
[2:02:36] i know what amalek is
[2:02:38] i already written in my law that i'm
[2:02:40] gonna wipe amalek that is my perfect
[2:02:43] will i just took you
[2:02:45] to obey and execute my will but you
[2:02:49] thought your intelligence is more higher
[2:02:51] than my will
[2:02:53] do you know who killed saul
[2:02:55] he was an amalekite
[2:02:59] what about if saul would have killed all
[2:03:01] the amalekites
[2:03:05] if you need a scripture you see me the
[2:03:07] one who killed saul was in america he
[2:03:09] saved the amalek and what he spared kill
[2:03:12] him later
[2:03:15] so god was looking at the life of saul
[2:03:17] he saw an amalekite in the future he
[2:03:20] said so
[2:03:22] i'm going to spare you tell you your
[2:03:23] life
[2:03:24] come here kill the americans
[2:03:27] saul never understood that god was
[2:03:30] protecting his future life
[2:03:36] but he thought he was the law
[2:03:39] he missed the love of god
[2:03:41] and that which he spared kill him
[2:03:44] if he would have wiped amalek
[2:03:47] no one would have killed saul
[2:03:52] here
[2:03:53] for rebellion
[2:03:55] is as the sin of water
[2:04:01] when you rebelling against god's word
[2:04:05] against the message of the hour you
[2:04:08] wonder a witchcraft spirit
[2:04:14] that's why you need to be careful who
[2:04:16] you hanging around with
[2:04:18] [Applause]
[2:04:23] let me help you up again
[2:04:25] everybody here
[2:04:27] and stableness
[2:04:30] in other words paul so
[2:04:32] you got two things that are discerned
[2:04:34] out of your life
[2:04:36] you got a rebellion spirit and you got a
[2:04:39] stubborn spirit
[2:04:41] rebellion is exactly like do you see the
[2:04:44] holdu doctor over there
[2:04:48] because they give you commandment and
[2:04:50] you didn't do it it's a rebellion spirit
[2:04:53] one number two stubbornness is as water
[2:04:58] and water
[2:04:59] why is stubbornness like iniquity
[2:05:06] iniquity is when you know something
[2:05:09] and you don't want to do it
[2:05:12] anybody care
[2:05:13] so a stubborn person
[2:05:16] is a person that was already been told
[2:05:19] what to do
[2:05:23] but they are refusing to do
[2:05:26] what they know should be done
[2:05:28] that's why stubbornness is like
[2:05:32] iniquity everybody okay
[2:05:35] so when a child is stubborn
[2:05:38] it's pretty bad
[2:05:41] and stubborn is also like a dollar tree
[2:05:45] what is idolatry
[2:05:50] brother branham say when you take
[2:05:53] something
[2:05:54] and you elevate that thing above god
[2:05:58] that becomes your adult
[2:06:03] everybody here so when somebody's
[2:06:05] stubborn it means that that person has
[2:06:09] something in their mind
[2:06:11] that they give more preeminence
[2:06:14] to it over the word of god
[2:06:17] that's why stubbornness is like
[2:06:21] iniquity and like idolatry but what god
[2:06:24] is require is obey and hearken and
[2:06:28] listen that's all i'm looking for
[2:06:32] hallelujah
[2:06:34] how do you hearken
[2:06:36] where are you going brother stephen
[2:06:39] this is it
[2:06:41] paul say
[2:06:42] john say
[2:06:43] for this is the love of god
[2:06:46] that we do whatever
[2:06:48] is he difficult
[2:06:51] you love the lord yes
[2:06:53] you cannot say i love the lord then
[2:06:55] you're quiet
[2:06:56] if you love a woman you're going to stay
[2:06:58] quiet
[2:07:02] everybody here
[2:07:03] amazon will be rich
[2:07:09] because she will begin to receive
[2:07:11] delivery at home
[2:07:13] all of that because you love her
[2:07:16] when you go to the restaurant you want
[2:07:18] to pay her meal
[2:07:22] you bring in flour
[2:07:24] so love doesn't stop right there it's
[2:07:27] accompanied by a life
[2:07:30] by a behavior
[2:07:31] by it by some doings
[2:07:33] by some works
[2:07:38] if you really love you got fruits
[2:07:40] [Applause]
[2:07:43] you got the life
[2:07:45] we see some works we see some doing we
[2:07:48] see some behavior that that woman really
[2:07:50] understand that this man without me he's
[2:07:53] gone
[2:07:57] hallelujah
[2:07:58] and his commandments are not water

[2:13:58] faith
[2:13:59] and love are water

[2:14:09] automatically
[2:14:11] the wife is following
[2:14:15] everybody here he says the husband work
[2:14:18] with the wife

[2:14:28] what i'm gonna go now handle tight and
[2:14:31] let me shoot
[2:14:32] you ready
[2:14:34] devil this is not the time to play
[2:14:36] around
[2:14:37] all right there is only two ways to do
[2:14:40] anything
[2:14:41] roof laboring
[2:14:43] how are we laboring
[2:14:45] and that is the right
[2:14:47] way
[2:14:48] and the wrong way
[2:14:50] and that is our way
[2:14:54] the wrong one
[2:14:56] and god's way
[2:14:58] our way always
[2:15:03] forever
[2:15:05] guaranteed
[2:15:06] the wrong way
[2:15:08] god's way
[2:15:10] always
[2:15:12] guaranteed
[2:15:14] right
[2:15:15] no matter how foolish
[2:15:20] are you okay
[2:15:21] are you okay i'm just moving the
[2:15:23] airplane are you okay
[2:15:25] foolish it seems to us how simple it is
[2:15:29] god behind it
[2:15:31] there is nothing that can do whatever
[2:15:36] speaks it in his laws
[2:15:38] and his ways operate how
[2:15:42] what are you trying to say brother
[2:15:44] stephen
[2:15:46] my god
[2:15:47] this is what i'm trying to say
[2:15:50] come on
[2:15:52] oh my
[2:15:56] this is the devil it's going to come up
[2:16:01] there we
[2:16:02] go
[2:16:04] the battery is working that's it
[2:16:06] okay now he's trying to run away not
[2:16:09] that one and then he say
[2:16:11] go and sit no more
[2:16:14] or worse things come upon you so
[2:16:18] therefore
[2:16:19] in order to obtain your healing
[2:16:23] you shall have to become a christian
[2:16:26] after you are here
[2:16:29] and i believe
[2:16:30] i would say this talking about the dual
[2:16:34] atonement
[2:16:36] when you are healed
[2:16:38] your sins are water
[2:16:44] what is happening
[2:16:47] anybody here
[2:16:49] when you meet christ at the cross
[2:16:54] we were taught by tradition
[2:16:57] that it's easy
[2:16:59] to give your life
[2:17:01] to god
[2:17:04] anybody care
[2:17:05] and it's hard
[2:17:07] to get heal
[2:17:11] everybody here
[2:17:13] give your heart to god lord jesus i give
[2:17:15] your heart and you go easy
[2:17:17] when they say believe on your healing
[2:17:18] then you have a hard time maybe i need
[2:17:20] to fast maybe i need to do this maybe i
[2:17:23] need to do this that's what we were
[2:17:25] taught
[2:17:26] but the atonement of cross
[2:17:28] have both of them
[2:17:31] everybody okay
[2:17:32] we have both of them connected
[2:17:35] anybody here so when you are approaching
[2:17:39] god in salvation
[2:17:42] you cannot have salvation without
[2:17:44] healing
[2:17:45] [Applause]
[2:17:50] hallelujah
[2:17:52] even if you don't need healing at that
[2:17:54] time
[2:17:55] healing is coming
[2:17:58] once you pull the other the other one
[2:18:01] come
[2:18:02] [Music]
[2:18:04] hallelujah
[2:18:06] when you are healed you are forgiven
[2:18:10] your sins are forgiven
[2:18:11] i didn't hear very emotes on that
[2:18:15] but it's the truth
[2:18:17] confess your fault one to another and
[2:18:20] pray you one for another that you may be
[2:18:23] water
[2:18:24] so confession and healing are put
[2:18:27] together
[2:18:29] go ye and sin no more always things come
[2:18:33] upon you
[2:18:34] jesus said which is easier to do
[2:18:37] say that since be what
[2:18:39] oh take up the bed and water do you
[2:18:42] remember that story
[2:18:44] it's all the water
[2:18:46] in other words when jesus began to
[2:18:48] discern the man came down from bed and
[2:18:52] he was sick instead of jesus healing him
[2:18:54] jesus look and say that sin be forgiven
[2:18:57] the pharisees look they say
[2:18:59] amen forgiving sin
[2:19:02] jesus looked at them he said i know he
[2:19:05] came for healing
[2:19:08] but i don't know what is hard for you
[2:19:11] you think which one is hard
[2:19:13] if i say healing
[2:19:15] or forgiveness of sin
[2:19:17] which one do you think is hard in other
[2:19:19] words both of them
[2:19:20] come as a package
[2:19:22] so when i say i forgive you if that man
[2:19:26] really understand he's going to walk and
[2:19:28] take up his bed and go
[2:19:29] [Applause]
[2:19:33] everybody okay
[2:19:34] why is this important in roof laboring
[2:19:39] why is it important
[2:19:41] in our sanctification
[2:19:43] why should i know what to do in our
[2:19:45] sanctification
[2:19:47] this
[2:19:48] package here
[2:19:50] of healing
[2:19:51] and salvation
[2:19:53] ever here
[2:19:55] lies in the greek word called sozo
[2:20:06] no man can save you
[2:20:08] only god can do that
[2:20:11] and he has already done it when jesus
[2:20:14] died
[2:20:16] he finished the works on your salvation
[2:20:18] for birth
[2:20:21] for your body and your water
[2:20:23] the very same word is used every time
[2:20:28] did you notice our text do not he say
[2:20:31] that faith has what
[2:20:33] faith save you and faith also heal you
[2:20:37] and the greek word
[2:20:39] there is so so
[2:20:42] sozo is used for both salvation
[2:20:46] and divine healing
[2:20:48] you are either saved
[2:20:51] or saved
[2:20:55] are we okay
[2:20:57] i go back to my greek to look it up and
[2:21:01] that word in the greek is so so
[2:21:03] the word save or salvation is sozo same
[2:21:09] one for healing
[2:21:11] means that they were physically safe
[2:21:15] or spiritually
[2:21:17] both words apply because it's the same
[2:21:21] the man
[2:21:23] on the same day he was wounded for hour
[2:21:27] with his trap we were
[2:21:29] both of them are connected
[2:21:31] [Applause]
[2:21:36] what are you saying brother stephen
[2:21:39] this greek song scholar here will tell
[2:21:42] you that the word there in the greek is
[2:21:44] sozo which means just exactly
[2:21:47] like save physically or save water
[2:21:52] that faith saved thee from hell
[2:21:54] the faith sent thee from death their
[2:21:57] faith safety from water
[2:22:00] it is also the same word
[2:22:03] listen to me carefully you ready
[2:22:06] so the same faith
[2:22:10] everybody okay
[2:22:11] that you have in god
[2:22:15] for your salvation
[2:22:17] is the same faith
[2:22:19] you use for your water just water
[2:22:23] [Music]
[2:22:29] how do you get sanctified
[2:22:32] you ready
[2:22:34] you ready
[2:22:36] let's start with healing
[2:22:40] when you somebody comes and they pray
[2:22:43] for you in jesus name amen
[2:22:48] do you feel better
[2:22:51] no you don't feel better
[2:22:53] except it's a miracle
[2:22:55] if it's a miracle right away you heal
[2:22:58] if it's not a gift of miracle when you
[2:23:00] come up it looks like everything is the
[2:23:02] same
[2:23:04] anybody here
[2:23:07] anybody here the headache is there
[2:23:12] the pain is there
[2:23:14] every symptom on the outside
[2:23:17] is still accurate
[2:23:20] but the demon is gone
[2:23:25] anybody here
[2:23:26] the way to remove the symptom
[2:23:30] is for you
[2:23:32] to begin to behave
[2:23:35] [Applause]
[2:23:36] [Music]
[2:23:40] everybody okay
[2:23:42] and act
[2:23:45] like you are already here
[2:23:48] [Applause]

[2:24:32] jesus never came back and said let me
[2:24:35] look at the tree if he worked
[2:24:37] jesus was just going but purposely
[2:24:41] he passed that avenue
[2:24:43] to teach the disciple a lesson
[2:24:51] because if he never passed that avenue
[2:24:54] they would never have known him he said
[2:24:56] i know my voice

[2:25:00] let me pass that up any master which

[2:53:56] struggling
[2:53:57] you want to get that weakness off
[2:53:59] begin to confess it
[2:54:01] begin to act like you already been
[2:54:03] delivered from that
[2:54:08] and associate with the people that
[2:54:11] already get delivered from that
[2:54:13] and they will work into righteousness
[2:54:16] let's pray my friend
[2:54:18] heavenly father
[2:54:19] lord we are approaching you again humbly
[2:54:21] this morning
[2:54:23] father thanking you once again
[2:54:25] for your grace for your love for your
[2:54:28] mercy father and for unfolding these
[2:54:30] things for us
[2:54:32] lord these things has been taught to be
[2:54:34] things that are complicated
[2:54:36] that are difficult that people went left
[2:54:39] and right and could not find deliverance
[2:54:42] but you heed everything under the word
[2:54:45] sozo into the dual atonement that the
[2:54:48] simplicity of salvation
[2:54:51] is the same key that is applied for
[2:54:53] healing and father we have measured many
[2:54:56] times in healing
[2:54:58] about getting be getting delivered for a
[2:55:00] sickness or praying for a loved one or
[2:55:03] praying for an operation or praying for
[2:55:06] an oncoming surgery but father we have
[2:55:09] been also suffering from demonic spirit
[2:55:12] from bad habit from smoking from cussing
[2:55:16] from gossiping from treating our
[2:55:18] families our husband our children our
[2:55:22] wife bad from not behaving good and we
[2:55:25] don't know the key to get delivered from
[2:55:27] those things and the key was still in
[2:55:29] the atonement you are the lord that
[2:55:32] forgive us all ours
[2:55:34] all our iniquities and you heal us from
[2:55:37] all our diseases if you can heal our
[2:55:39] body
[2:55:40] and you can remove a demon
[2:55:43] by healing you can also remove a demon
[2:55:46] by that way of salvation
[2:55:48] father may your children never pay
[2:55:51] attention to their weaknesses
[2:55:53] if their leper would have looked at
[2:55:55] their condition would have looked at the
[2:55:58] situation
[2:55:59] where there were leopards
[2:56:01] and maybe they already lost somebody
[2:56:04] members maybe they lost their fingers
[2:56:07] maybe they already lost their toes maybe
[2:56:09] they already lost some of their members
[2:56:12] but they never look at that situation
[2:56:14] they only took a decision and by
[2:56:17] decision they acted upon that decision
[2:56:20] and lord you step on the scene because
[2:56:23] when we do our part you also come and
[2:56:26] you add your part and when you took over
[2:56:30] not only did you bring food but father
[2:56:33] you brought more because you always give
[2:56:35] us exceedingly and abundantly above all
[2:56:39] we can ask and think and father i'm

[2:57:01] they gather genetics from their family
[2:57:04] and they just behave a certain way or
[2:57:06] they have a weakness in a certain way by
[2:57:09] the power of the holy spirit father i'm
[2:57:12] standing here upon the atonement of
[2:57:14] cavalry i rebuke those demonic spirits
