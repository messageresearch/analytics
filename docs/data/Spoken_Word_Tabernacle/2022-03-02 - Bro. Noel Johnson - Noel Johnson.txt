ask my wife will tell you amen that devil he was really mad for the brazen altar [Laughter] but the blood would never amen never lose its power amen you need that altar amen but thank god we are victorious about god's grace amen i stand i stood there and i can feel the anointing if you don't feel it you need to shake yourself up shake somebody's hand and tell them we are ready for the word amen blessed be the name of the lord how many are up to date with the sermon okay blessed be the name of the lord you continue to pray please for the christian in ukraine yeah it looks like this world is turning into a different direction yeah it's not the way they thought now it's lingering and i was talking to brother kelly and say there is a saying overseas they say when two elephants are fighting the ground suffer amen so when two people are fighting over there it's the innocent that suffers they didn't intend to be in the war they were not even thinking about the war and suddenly they are in the midst of the war amen so i receive correspondence i mean i can say update from a local brother who is usually in contact to let me know what is going on and how things are going it's not pretty good up there so you keep the believers in prayer if we were in the same situation we wanted somebody to pray for us amen that's one side on the other side if your life is not in serious situation with god i don't know what you need to have in your life to wake up i don't know you might be seated so i don't know what you need in your life to wake up if you have a chance going through the message look at the uh iron curtain just go ahead and tap in russia and it will scare you to death amen but for the blood we happy because we know that our time is joining we're not going to stay here longer amen so if your life is not correct with god i don't know what you need to wake up kovid came you now waking up so this is russia coming up you're still sleeping so you better wake up amen wake up go to the brazen altar make sure your life is completely dead before you rise up there then we can move on to perfection amen lord willing i believe it's this coming saturday we have the sisters meeting you will check your cell phone if you don't receive the message it's not my fault i said it over and over in the hotel so you don't want i need to give brother david your your number so you can get the text message the address will be given to you and the time brother robert it's at 2 30 yet 2 30 p.m 2 30 doesn't mean 4 p.m or 5 p.m amen i have almost 55 questions for one meeting how am i gonna answer them amen you have one person sending like four the other one sending like 20 the other person said so if you send me 20 question or five question or ten questions i'm not going to go through your question one two three four because we will be probably holding your paper forever so i might have to go spiritically going touch one person and the next and the next and come back to your question amen because i have 55 questions it's telling me we need more than one meeting amen and some of the questions i'm wondering if some of you were sleeping at the hotel or not because we cover a lot about how a young lady should behave whether you need to go in the same car with a man no because the answer is no it's there on youtube where the young girl need to hug no it's on youtube so we went through all those territory with a lot of detail a lot of scripture and a lot of code so if you miss it and you were sleeping in a hotel when we were preaching talk to me send me a text i'm not going to mention your name i have all the themes of the king of hazaris three fists and esther three banquet i'm waiting for the website to be done then we can change the title so you can view them quickly but if you need reference let me know i'm gonna text to you all the theme from one all the way to 45 so you can you can use the theme as a reference quickly whether you want to know how long should the skirt be and what about the high heel what about the the earring what about the three virtues of a woman all of them we went through them in detail so i don't know whether somebody was sleeping or they were awake or they were running away when i was using the weapon so you better go back remember whatever where you left crust is where you need to go back and grab it amen so be there at 2 30. lord's willing pray for it so we will have a good time by god's grace we will probably have to change the march 19th there is a conflict in the schedule so we will let you know probably by uh sunday lords willing there was a conflict the 19 is closed on the venue so just stay on the lookout for a text or something but we will let you know amen if i'm not mistaken we will have our building fund this coming sunday and lord's willing just continue do the best that you can we still have work to do and also continue to remember brother charles hamilton grandfather i believe and then sister cindy in prayer you don't see sister cindy much here so continue to pray her she need really really really attach in her body amen and when you get a chance i don't have to teach you this you need to give her a call and talk to her you don't see a sister for a while give them a call and check on them you say how are you doing you need something and things like that not only the pastor and the deacon i already checked on her i know what's going on it's your duty to do it i'm not gonna tell you what i got from the report amen so that would be good so you can call amen you need her number talk to the deacon or talk to brother greg or talk to the pastor we can give you a number just to comfort one another when somebody's suffering amen blessed be the name of the lord we have brother noah johnson with us here tonight sister shell is here ready for the word so you know brother joe oh brother no he already preached for us here before pull on the gift of the lord you learn it from last wednesday and the lord will continue to minister for us amen let's stand and continue we only believe [Music] all things are possible only believed [Music] [Music] oh [Music] so all things [Music] feelings [Music] so all things [Music] i want to greet you all in the name of the lord jesus christ and it's my privilege to be with you this evening while we're standing if we would bow our heads for a word of prayer and then we'll get into the word our most gracious and loving heavenly father it is always our privilege to gather ourselves together around your word and then sit at your feet and receive what you'd have for us we've given unto you songs of worship and praise from our heart and lord if it came from my heart then lord we know that you received it and now lord we've invited your presence and we know that it's here so lord now i take me as your vessel and lord use me for your honor and for your glory and speak through me unto your people to encourage us lord in the hour in which we find ourselves just grant this lord i'm asking it in jesus christ's name amen and while you're standing if you'd open your bibles to romans the eighth chapter and read verses 17 and 18. we're living in very difficult times and this is what the lord put on my heart and so i am trusting that it will be an encouragement if you will to you all this evening so romans the eighth chapter will read verses 17 and 18. paul writing here he says and if children then heirs heirs of god and joint heirs with christ if so be that we suffer with him that we may also be glorified together for i reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us you can have your seeds when we look at what's going on in the world um if it wasn't that we have jesus christ i would be nervous because when i read through the scriptures i understand that god's word must be fulfilled and god's word says that this nation must fall it says that all the kingdoms of the world must fall and so everything that's going on in the world today is exactly according to god's plan and purpose god is sovereign nothing happens outside of it being his will you say well what about all the sufferings what about all the things going on in the world well who brought it on if you had accepted jesus christ if you had lived for jesus christ if you had given your heart and heart to jesus christ and you were living according to the word it wouldn't be all this stuff would not be coming but because satan is the one that's in control of this earth that's why we're having the things which we are doing um i won't get into politics that's a bad subject but we know we're living in about we're living in an end time we know that the things going on in the world is anything but happy and like i say if it wasn't for the fact that i knew jesus christ and i knew that he was sovereign really i would be very nervous but because i trust in jesus christ and because i know him as my savior i can rest you know when i did a study on the book of habakkuk that changed my whole concept of faith faith is not believing for something faith is believing in someone if you believe that god is sovereign if you believe that god is all-powerful if you believe that god is able to do all things and you are resting in him then why are we worried because he is the one who's going to you he was the one that's in control i have no idea what tomorrow will bring i'm glad i don't know what tomorrow may bring but see i know he's already been there and because he has already been there i can rest assured that if i walk in his will that he will lead and he will guide me and he will take care of my tomorrow and he takes care of that tomorrow he'll take care of the other tomorrow when we look about healing god's already healed you that's an established fact that's his word well if you can believe it and you trust and you believe in the god that has made the promise then that promise is a reality to you and then you're just waiting for the fulfillment you're merely waiting for the manifestation of the healing that he's already given to you and your body but if you don't believe in him if you don't trust him then all of a sudden then you have worries and doubts and frustrations and all the other things that tend to go with it but here again like i say what what's going on in the world today is it god already knew this was going to happen he knew that covert was com that was covered was going to come he knew the changes it would make within our world order he knew when on 9 911 hid in our in our country a few years back he knew the changes that would bring in our nation and he looks at and in all the governments of the world and you begin to look at what's going on within the world and and to the world like i say it it's a fearsome time i mean the ones in in in tetsnia i mean the things they're going through they hadn't planned on this but now they're in the middle of war and russia is frustrated and so they're they're killing civilians they're not worried about killing military they're killed they want to kill the civilians okay but that's satan i mean here again that's going on with that but we but we have to begin to understand that the time that we are living in these are the things which are these are the things which god had said will come to pass so they have to come to pass you know a minister made he quoted in uh when joshua was sitting on a hill and looking over over over jericho the angel of god came unto him and and and joshua drove his sword and says are you forced or for the enemy and i always thought well yeah he just said he was going to say for joshua but when you read the scripture says no he's not for joshua he's not for the enemy what he's for is for god's word what he's for is for god's plan and god's purpose that god's plan and purpose will be fulfilled that is the only thing that god is trying to hurt that that's what that's everything is geared toward that end and so if joshua would have gone and or if he went ahead and he would deal with the will of god then god was for him but if all of a sudden god gave him the instructions of how to take it take over jericho and he said well no i don't think that's a good plan we're going to do it our way then god would have never helped him but as long as he stayed with the word then the word would be fulfilled as long as we stay with the word then the word will be fulfilled but we have to be willing to submit ourselves to him we have to be willing to take our lives and so put it in his hands until it's no longer i who live but it's christ that liveth in me we know that there's things going on in in our in in our in within the message which i find very disturbing but i also know that i mean during the time in which paul lived there was false teachers all over the place paul would go into glacier and he would preach something and then people would receive it with thanksgiving and rejoicing it and no longer sooner had left and people from jerusalem decided to come along and say oh no you've got to go back to the laws of moses and so paul had to go back and he had to correct all the heirs and wherever paul went the false teachers followed after him but this but here again we come down to the understanding these have to be they have to come they have to manifest who they are so that we can manifest who we are jesus jesus christ even even warned us this in matthew he said he said and many shall come and many shall be offended and shall betray one another and shall hate one another he said that many false prophets shall arise and shall deceive many and because iniquity shall abound the love of many shall wax cold and that's what's going on in the world because the iniquity is is as rampant as it is i mean there is no righteousness there is no holiness there is no purity i mean you can't even walk into walmart with seeing well actually it's almost like going into a zoo but i guess that's not a good but but you have to begin to understand they're they're anointed with a different spirit well we are have do we have to let our light shine so that all this wickedness they can look at says why are you so different well i believe in jesus christ oh really that's what makes you so different yeah can i introduce you to him well you know and so there's an open door that we have but anyway but but christ goes on and says but he that shall endure to the end shall be saved it's not who begins the race it's the one who finishes and i've seen many people begin the race and where are they now like our pastor had made mention once he said do you realize he said that everybody that had ever come into into into bible tabernacle if they ever came back he says we need a church three psalms the size that we have right now and where they where did they go some of them came in there they got on fire for god and for some reason the fire went out and they drifted back out into the world and you never see or hear from them again so paul so jesus christ was saying you have to endure unto the end and so in the troublesome times that we're in right now you have to be willing to endure but but endure implies that well i just put up with it but see that that's not that really doesn't work just just by enduring or you know letting everything grow go along and just well you know this is going to be all right and tomorrow might be better no no that that that's that's not the point but to endure you have you have you have to you have to work at enduring you have to work at being a member of a part of the body of jesus christ you have to work at going and and making your your calling in the election sure because if you don't apply the if you don't apply yourselves to continue in the work if you don't apply yourself to continue in the word you will drift and it's a daily battle that you go through it's not always coming sunday and that's fine and maybe i might show up on wednesday if it's convenient and then we'll suddenly come around well i might i might make it you know um okay if so you go ahead and you you go to a restaurant on sunday and you stuff yourself and then you decide you're not going to eat for the rest of the week you're not going to have enough strength to do anything so you have to get into the word continually you have to sit there and continually apply yourself you have to continually feed upon the word you have to continue to get into the tapes i i know i i wouldn't i still minister in india i do that twice a month and and we have 300 messages now in the telugu language and the selection is actually quite good and so i'm encouraging them get into the tapes get into the word read it because if you don't get into the word if you're not constantly in the word you will never gain the strength that you need in order to be able to endure [Applause] we know in the latest in church age one of the things it's lukewarm okay but i look in the message it's not much hotter than the baptist in fact sometimes the baptists have more fire in them than i've seen in many message churches because we have become used to the to what we call the gospel but see it for what do we strive you take a child or just you use a different example i i'm not much on olympics but i i've read about some of their stories some of them they're they they do the things that they do in the olympics like the ones that i know about the gymnastics that's the one i read about the most their parents wanted them too their parents pushed them too but something within the child sparked them and they say hey i really i really want to do this then they began to apply themselves then they began to exert all of the energy and all of the training and everything all of the encouragement that the coaches would give them and they would exceed beyond what the coaches thought was possible for them to to produce because it came from inside of them they had the desire but see i look at i i look at the message churches i wonder where's our desire where is our on fire for god where is our when we when we go someplace is our life a witness to us that you're going around in nice smiling faces even though you're miserable you're nice smiling faces and you say you you greet them night i mean we go to we go to the to the grocery store how are you doing you know they ask well he says well if we're doing fine how are you doing i said we're doing great are you doing great and they look at me kind of well um yeah okay and then we get a little conversation going and it changes their whole day like i go to the bakery because i like their bread and so the lady was cutting it and i noticed she just decorates cakes and so i asked her how she was doing that i says do you get to lick the bowl and she smiled but see that might have been the only time in her whole day that somebody actually gave her something to smile about that might have changed their whole attitude for the day i mean i don't know but here again this is something that comes to mind and so you talk with them you give them a conversation you're kind and considerate to them you acknowledge who they are and what they're doing and you mean and here again you begin to show yourself the way you care about them as an individual but so we have to get out of the out of lady osea because see that we are no longer supposed to be in ladies here we are supposed to be in revelations of 4 and 1. john come up higher because i have things i want to show you what was god doing through the prophet he said hey you're the bride come up higher i got some things i want to show you and we're only to get to see the deeper things of god simply because god has through the prophet he has revealed all of these things to us the baptist have no idea what's going on my my son-in-law he was starting to teach on the church ages and we attended his service i was curious anyway and uh i'm yet it's good uh baptist teaching as far as baptist teaching could go but there was no revelation there was literally no understanding until we understand they couldn't they could not see the serpent seed they could not see satan going all the way through the church ages and this is what god was trying to show us through the prophet's message the satan started out here it started out with with the deeds of the nicolasians and it progressed and progressed and progressed and now that same spirit has invaded into the into the message but see we are not to be partakers of any of that we are not to be under the leadership of a man we are supposed to be under the leadership of the holy spirit the holy spirit is supposed to be leading and guiding your lives and if you haven't come to the place where he does that you need to make a better connection with him endure means to remain have fortitude or to persevere it's not just laying back well i hope it'll change and i hope it will be better tomorrow no endure means you have to apply energy you have to seek it out you have to you have to get in you have to get in and make a relationship with jesus christ where he literally becomes the very center of your life because anything short of that will not work when we go back into romans we start out here romans 8 18 it says for i reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us and i began to look at that i began to what is this glory that paul was trying to talk about because you see the sufferings of the present time he said they're not even worthy they don't even hold a candle to what's coming and that was in paul's day but we see we're at the end we're at the time when everything is going to come into its fulfillment we are going to experience this glory we are going to be a part of the changing of our body we're going to be a part of the rapture we're going to be trying all of these all of these things and so and and so paul is trying to encourage them he says don't look at the situations of today no look at what's coming focus the focus of the end of the end of the race focus at the glory which god has said will be revealed in you and see right now in paul's day that was 2 000 years ago but see now we are at this time we're at the time when we're actually going beginning to see the fulfillment of these scriptures the rap the process of the rapture has begun it's not a single time event and in thessalonians if we believe that jesus died and rose again even so them also would sleep in jesus god will bring with him okay that means all of the all of the saints that have died on have died since pentecost they're going to rise paul james john timothy matthew and a whole bunch of the rest of them i mean there's going to be what tens of thousands millions and you're going to be able to talk to them i mean literally you're going to be able to convert i don't think there'll be a language barrier at that point in time but you'll be able to see them and you'll be able to talk to them you'll be able to ask them how it was in their day and and they will come and encourage you hey you know brother branham from the types we have it's 30 or 40 days from the time of the resurrection all of a sudden then our we get our change but all of them are coming do you comprehend that all of them are coming and they are coming for what to encourage us to finish the race don't look at today because things are going to get worse if you think they're bad now wait wait till tomorrow it's going to get worse wait till next week it'll get even worse why because it's the end time but see it's going to come to the time it's going to come to the place where we as the bride are going to get so sick and tired of this world and all the things that are going on will say even so come lord jesus but see we have to come to a place in our relationship with jesus christ we really want him to come some don't because they like this world they like doing what they're doing they don't want their sins to be revealed they don't want everybody to know what they have been doing so they're not looking for the rapture they're not looking for this change no they're they're they're willing to to go ahead and let let the world keep going the way they're going because they're like living in this world i have found nothing in this world i like i mean it's getting worse and worse and even anyway but but all of these are going to come we're going to see all of them we're going to talk to them what's going to happen all of a sudden you're sitting at your at your in your in your in your house and you get a knock on the door and one of your your parents which have gone on they knock at the door and they hey hey son daughter i'd like to have breakfast with you that'll change your attitude and talk about having faith after that man nothing will stand in the way but see this is what's coming this is what's coming this is the glory that's going to be revealed in us because when they come forth all of a sudden i know in 30 days i'm going to be a young man again no more aches and pains i'll be back to 120 pounds and you know i'll be back to you know what i would like to be in that regard but see 30 or 40 days after the after there after the resurrection takes place all of a sudden i know i'm going to be changed there'll be no doubt in my mind at that point in time okay i'm looking for that change and i'm waiting for any day any day come on let's go let's go it says for the lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout out the voice of the archangel the trump of god and the dead in christ shall rise first when we talk about the shout brother branham said it's this message but see there's there's some things which we when i was researching some of this i began i ran across a few a few interesting items if you will when brother branham's discernment began in the early 50 that was the son of man revealing himself through the prophet because that was discernment which means he had already descended he was already coming from that dimension into this dimension because he was trying to take a bride and take a bride and prepare them for the rapture and so god was using that man he was speaking through him in the in the lines of discernment and as it progressed in brother branham's life because brother branham in 1950 he didn't know he was the prophet to the age he thought billy graham was i mean i i can show you quotes on that but this was 50 he was just beginning his ministry it took a while for him to realize i mean he realized he was a prophet he had come to that realization before this but here again god was beginning to mold him and make him to the place where god could so speak through him until until we would have confidence in the things god was trying to tell us through him that's why the miracles that's why the healing that's why they're prayer lines what he what was his theme jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever from the beginning of his ministry that was that was that was the message which he was trying to portray because god does not change well if god does not change what he was yesterday he is today what he was what he manifested in brother branham he will manifest in you not necessarily in discernment not necessarily in some other thing but as far as when it goes for prayer for the sick and seeing the sick heal if you have the faith to believe it you can go ahead brother branham continually refers to that he said he says you don't have to wait for your pastor to pray he says the power of god lives in you so he says you take your hand and you if you can if you can recognize that you're sitting next to a son or daughter of god and you take your hand and place it on that person and you pray for that person god will heal that person because god in you is going to reach out to that person and going to heal them it's that simple [Music] we make it complicated it's not jesus christ is here he's wanting to express himself he's wanting to manifest himself but he needs people who believe him we sing only believe only believe all things are possible and it is but do you believe the song you sang we say jesus is here jesus is there therefore all things are possible if you would believe that then why aren't any of us sick i'm just throwing it out okay but if jesus is here the same jesus that healed the same jesus that torches your salvation the same jesus the purchaser here if he is here then when you walk out this door there should not be there's none should not be a sick one amongst us but you have to believe like i say faith is not believing for something faith is believing in someone and if you can believe that that god is all-powerful and almighty if you believe that god is sovereign in everything that he does if you can accept him in that capacity then why are you worried why do you fret why do you why are you concerned about tomorrow because that god already knows and if you have and one of the things that i that i after reading in habakkuk have it's an interesting little i mean it's only three chapters habakkuk had to come to the realization that he that he had to take in place his total faith and confidence in god and he had to come to the place in the the last part of habakkuk he said even though there is nothing even though there is total destitution even though he has resisted reducing no food and no clothing and no housing and no water no nothing yet he still i will worship god as if i possessed everything what i possess will not affect how i worship my god i will worship him and i will honor him and i will and i will do with all of the energy that i have i will worship and praise him even if i am reduced to nothing [Music] but see we have to come to the same. if all of a sudden tomorrow you have nothing will you still worship god and will you worship him as if you possessed everything because in my opinion it's coming anyway invert in the first seal brother branham changed he says i no longer call you church i call you bride in the first seal when the seals were open brother branham said that is when the seventh angel messenger began to sound his message and he turned he was no longer interested in going to the denominational churches he was interested in taking the bride that had taken hold of the message and he wanted them to be able to grab hold of who they are and what they are and so his whole message focused now on the bride not the church world the bride itself and that's who we are we know that the south the bible in romans 8 19 the earnest expectation the earnest expectation of the creature is waiting for the manifestation of the sons of god that the whole creation is waiting and groaning for us to realize who we are but see we still think of ourselves as sinners saved by grace when i was in the baptist church i was a sinner saved by grace in the pentecostal church i was a sinner saved by grace i'm still a sinner saved by grace but now i am also a child of god that has been fully restored to his position with his father and now all i'm waiting for is for the adoption of my body with the changing of my body so i can have the relationship with my father that i desired to have from the beginning because i was a part of him from the beginning and now it's time for me to come into full manifestation so i can literally become a son of god in the full manifestation as a son of god where i can speak in whatever i speak i know that it will happen because god has anointed me to speak that word [Music] this is where this is the this is the glory this is the glory that is to be revealed in us not unto the church well no in us and the in the sons and the daughters of god when we begin to take our place when we begin to realize that we are sons and daughters of god and we begin to realize that we can go ahead and we can defeat satan satan is a tool in the hands of god he's a bulldog on a chain he can only go as far as god lets him go [Music] and you have the power to tell him to to leave but you have to believe you know brother brother branham says the token today is the is the life of jesus christ it's not the baptism of the holy spirit no now it has to be the life of god in us expressing itself through us and so when you stand before satan and all of a sudden you're going to command him no there has to be the life of jesus christ in you which is sitting there and can express itself to satan where he knows you're not a bluff that as he did as he stood before jesus christ and he tried to have jesus christ do something which was contrary to the word all of a sudden when he realizes he's fighting the jesus christ in me okay all of a sudden he realized hey we're on a different page hey you know this guy actually believes who he says he is this guy actually believes in the atonement this guy actually believes in the spoken word this guy actually believes in the message of the hour but see it comes it has to be a change in our thinking the bible brother branham says you are the pure virtuous sinless bride of jesus christ you have been fully redeemed you're fully justified that's just as if you never sin so forget about what you did yesterday or today and begin to realize that there is nothing held against your charge that god views you as sinless as god himself is sinless and that should give you the faith and the ability to stand before satan and satan will remind you oh but what you did yesterday oh what about the day before that man what a mistake you made back then yeah but that's all under the blood god can't find it well if god can't find it why should i remember it and therefore i can stand before him and say no i am the pure verse to a sinless bride of jesus christ i am the living manifestation of the word for this day brother branham told me i am the living manifestation of the word for this day i was a part of god from the beginning i came into manifestation i recognize now who i am and because i recognize that i am i am a son of god i therefore because i can recognize my position i can sit there and in my position i can command [Music] now if you're working for somebody you have a boss most people i would assume have a boss okay and so you take orders from your boss theoretically okay but see when you're the boss then everybody takes orders from you okay but see we're part of a kingdom we rule and reign with christ we are not superior to him we are not beneath him we are equal we are co-equal with him because we are his son and he has given us the authority what did he tell the disciples he says go into this village in these villages cast you know heal the sick raise the dead cast out demon i have freely given you this ability now freely use that has never been taken back but see the disciples knew this the day of pentecost finally finally came all of a sudden that's what they did they healed the sick they raised the dead they cast out demons because they knew they had the authority because that authority was given to them were they perfect oh no way shape or form but they knew who they were brother branham said jesus could do the things that he did because he knew who he was and now it's up for the bride to realize who she is and if you can realize who you are in jesus christ and you can realize you are a son and a daughter of god then satan should not have any power over you in revelation 10 7 it says in the days of the voice of the seventh angel and he shall begin to sound the mystery of god is going to be finished and what is this mystery of god paul in colossians says what is this mystery he says it's been here down from ages and generations but has now made manifest to the saints which is christ in you the hope of glory it's christ living in you you know jesus never performed one miracle no it was the father in him brother branham never performed one miracle he was a father that dwelt in him paul never performed any miracles peter never performed any miracles no he was the god in them but they had to be in communion with that god they had to have a relationship with that god where where that god could speak to them and they would then they could listen and then if they would listen they would obey what god told them to do and it didn't matter what tomorrow was i mean you look at the life of paul how often he was shipwrecked how often he was beaten he said a day and a night he spent swimming around in in in the mediterranean he had to hang on the boards or whatever it was until he finally got rescued he was stoned a few he was stoned and left for dead once he was beaten i don't know how many times are you thrown in jail oh yeah easy life right easy life but he didn't worry about tomorrow he said the sufferings of this present time are not even worthy to be compared to what the glory is going to be revealed in me and we do we struggle shall we struggle but the struggling we have is more mental than it is anything else but see we have to we have to overcome all of this we have to begin to accept what god says that we are in 1961 brother bannon makes a statement but see now remember he explained that by sodom he says and this and this is the time of sodom when the world is going to be burned not drown but burn it's going to be burned and this sign has was to return not an ark but but a god dwelling in the flesh of his people in his church this was 61. he's talking about when when god appeared to abraham and read this into secrets of of the heart of sarah he was saying this was the son of man being revealed this was god coming down and this is and god is coming down and god's going to be dwelling in the flesh of his people and they say oh yeah that was brother branham no god's people sons and daughters of god you see if you if how many have received the holy spirit willing to admit it okay that's good what did you receive the third person of a trinity the same god that from you know from from the from genesis the one that created all things the one that healed the sick the one that raised the dead the one that cast out demons the one that walked on the waters the one that still the storms so what do you do with him you hide him are you going to release him are you by your faith going to allow that god that dwells in you to use you so he can express himself through you brother branham had to come to a relationship with god work where he no longer did his own thing but he listened to what the father was telling him and he went wherever he was directed by that spirit to go it wasn't brother branham living it wasn't brother branham striving it wasn't brother branham trying to pray it up or bring it down or whatever no he said the spirit of god that dwelt in him he said he would take and he would yield himself to that spirit and that spirit would lead him and guide him and direct him well what's the difference what's the difference between him and you can't god lead you if somebody has a need can't you minister to that person will you allow the god in you to minister to that person amen but you have to allow him you can stop god you can say well lord i'm too busy today i don't feel like going there today go find somebody else you know i got my schedule laid out for today and i just can't fit that in so you need to find somebody else to do that today i mean there was a brother he won't mind me saying that there was a brother in our church and he had had a surgery on his elbow the surgery was as good as i guess as the doctors could do and then he had developed an infection other doctors treated with antibiotics and they did the best which they could and it seemed to clear up and then it came back and then it came on back again only this time worse and uh so then he end up end up ending up in charlotte i don't like going to charlotte i don't like where there's more than 10 cars you know you know in a parking lot where we live after 50 cars have gone by our street we have reached the quota for today nobody else has to come i like living in the country okay but anyway that the brother was in charlotte and the lord told me go pray for him well i'm not the pastor i'm not the trustee i'm not one of the deacons um there's plenty others in the church i'm you know i got my schedule laid out today and well um yeah maybe i could fit it in you know but not today maybe next week we could and uh no if i had refused to go what god wanted me to do for the brother would have never happened so i drove into charlotte found the room he was in we'd visited for a little bit and i asked him i said you know why i'm here he says well no not really he says god sent me here to pray for you because we're no longer dealing with with the medical problem we're dealing with a spiritual problem isis satan is attacking your elbow and we have the power to get rid of that so i i anointed him i didn't know i just prayed i commanded that damon to leave and having done what i believe god had sent me to do i i managed to make it home okay um from that point on healing began in his elbow and i'm not patting myself i'm merely trying to express something god directed me to go well if i had determined i wasn't going to go god does you know god does not have a plan b he chose moses moses tried to back out he said you ain't backing out you're going okay and and uh i think it was jeremiah i think it was him anyway he wanted to quit uh he was going to throw in the sponge the god you lied to me you're making me and people don't like me anymore and i'm getting tired of this so i'm not going to speak anymore and then he says it was like like like fire burning in my bones okay he could not quit um jonah didn't want to go to didn't want to go to nineveh god says yes you're going so he said i'd rather die than go so he got in a boat he had to be swallowed by a fish and then finally in the belly of the fish he realized you know it's not really convenient being in here it's they're much better if i was up and doing something different and so the fish finally spit them out and god says now will you go well yeah okay you've persuaded me i guess i will okay but i mean here i mean sometimes god will throw you in the fish if he has to but but i mean you have you have to realize god has a plan and if you are the one that he is predestined to fulfill that plan that he has no plan b brother branham goes on he says it's god in you all that god was he poured into christ no the christ was he poured into the church so it's god above us it's god with us now it's god in us god above us in the father god in with us the son cleansing his way can the condescending coming down making a way for me to go back and bring his people back to the manifestation of the sons of god like they had them in the garden he said he has no voice tonight but your voice he has no hands but your hands he has he ha he has your hands that those hands that those hands it is he says i am the vine you're the branches so he's trying to say he's trying to tell us you if god wants to do something he has to work through his body and if you claim to be part of the body of jesus christ then he wants to work through you he goes on in restoration the right tree he says he says that that day you'll know that i am in the father the father is me i and you and you and me oh i just love that and satan gets so angry with that he says don't you see the oneness of god he's taking you and placing you in the godhead i mean i don't read like there's no other way i can read that but that makes us part of him that makes us a part of his body that makes us a manifestation of him and if we are to be the manifestation of him he says all that god was deported to jesus christ he emptied into jesus christ in everything in jesus christ he has emptied into his church and he says that makes us part of the fullness of the godhead bodily we are the body of god well if god dwells in you then let him if god dwells in you release him if god dwells in you by faith be able to claim what god says that you are and release the god that is within you so that that god that is in you can can express themselves to other people but this doesn't come just by attending church once in a while and reading your bible when it's convenient no it takes a commitment [Music] we are not in lady osea ladies lukewarm now we're in the bright age we're in the bright coming of jesus christ well if we are in the bright age and the bright coming of jesus christ where jesus christ so dwells in his in his bro in his bride until the bride now becomes a full manifestation expression of him then why aren't why don't we express that why don't we live then where is our zeal where where is the where's the burden we have for others where where where's the joy that we're supposed to be able to express unto others he said he said in the book of revelation he says he knows that the people get a true revelation of the true church and what she is and what she stands for that she can do the greater works she will be an invincible army if they get the true revelation of the two spirits within the framework of the church and and and withstand the if they get a true revelation of the two spirits within the framework of the christian church and by god's spirit discern and withstand the antichrist spirit satan is powerless before her okay so we should be an invincible army invincible means undefeatable so no matter what satan throws against you you have god dwelling in you and that god that is in you has the ability to defeat satan but you have to let him how do you how do you defeat satan you have the faith to believe in the god that has called you you have to have the faith and the promises that god has given to us in his word you have to believe in the god that through the prophet began to express to to the bride who she is and what she is and that the power of god now dwells in her it's it's i mean people take and and what they try and do is they try and make it to put everything in the prophet no the god through the prophet began to show me the possibility of what lives in me i'm not a prophet i don't want to be one i don't have discernment i don't want to have it because there's a whole bunch of responsibility goes with some of that stuff but if i can have a relationship with god such that i can walk in the spirit and i can allow him to lead me and guide me to the places he wants me to go and then when i get wherever he wants me to go i can minister according to what he quickens into my mind and then all of a sudden then i am ministering on god's behalf not even realizing what i'm doing god has redeemed us from the curse of the law the law has no applications to us he said we're in love love is above the law in love there is no law because there's something inside of us which is controlling our actions and that love that is one side of us controls the actions that we have love jesus christ because i love him i do the things he asks they're not burdensome i don't look at them as something that's being put upon me that i have to submit to no my wife when we we when we shop we shop together we we do everything together okay and so she i would like a nice pretty dress and i say man that's pretty i said she says yeah but she says it's not decent oh and she one she says okay let me try it on i'll show you so she put it on i says oh yeah no no no that ain't gonna work no no no put it back put it back okay so she proved her point and after that i i mean we go i we have her try on things and if i like it i tell her that if i don't like it i tell her that she dresses to please me okay but she also she dresses because of the convictions she has as far as what she would believe is decent and moral okay the same thing with me and god he tells me what what he says i don't like that oh okay i lord i won't do that anymore lord i'm sorry i did that well you shouldn't go here but lord there's nothing wrong with me going there no don't go there and a couple of times i went and i wish i had not and after that at least i learned don't go there yes sir no problems no no no questions anymore no problem because i know that if i if i disobey him then all of a sudden i am out of his will and then if i'm out of his will then there are consequences that go with that he said to redeem us back into the reconciliation to god that we might walk with him as in the beginning to be able to walk with god the same way adam and eve walked with god in the garden that is how we are to walk with him since we are in jesus christ there is no there is nothing between us and god if your sins have been confessed and they're under the blood there you have open fellowship with god you can talk with him anytime in each place anywhere and he's right there to be able to talk with you and to commune with you and to lead you and to guide you he said if you're standing on god's word and with god's word every man every amen every jot every tittle when you're standing i'm trying to tell you put away from that shuck he said you are the pure virtuous sinless bride of the of the living god every man and woman that's born of the spirit of god and worst in the blood of jesus christ and believes every word of god stands as though you never sinned in the first place you are perfect the blood of jesus christ he goes on he says oh that spiritual union with christ and his church now when the flesh is becoming word and the word is becoming flesh manifested and vindicated just what the bible said would happen in this day it's happening day by day he said you're standing completely you've never seen it the first place god don't even know it's in the sea of forgetfulness you never did it you were accused of it by the accuser but really from the beginning you were predestined to be a son and daughter of god you're standing there worse and your old book of divorcement is put away and it's dead absolutely out of existence you are and again he goes on you are the virtuous rider of jesus christ washing the blood of christ the precious virtuous sinless son of god is standing with a pure unadulterated bride word that he worsh by the water of his own blood and then and that flesh then became manifest that he might take he might take them which were predestinated we're living at the end we're living at the time when time will cease to exist i'm living in a time in which i am looking for the changing of my body i'm living in the time when i'm looking for my father and my mother to come and sit there and have breakfast with me some morning i'm living in the time when my brother should also come by and knock on the door and says hey how's my truck doing it's the only thing i have from him but anyway but but i mean it's you know you say that's that's funny and silly well but i mean i i'm looking for them i mean i'm earnestly looking for them because things are getting worse and worse and worse i mean i i i hear people in other churches and they're talking about have faith have faith have faith and and okay but to me like i say faith is not believing for something believe faith is prince is in believing in someone because if i believe in that someone that no matter what comes i know that god that i believe in he can take care of it because he already have he already has promised me to do that so i become like havoc lord i'm putting my hand in yours this morning don't let go wherever you want me to go you just lead now and i'll follow because if you if i'm in your hand and i'm going where you want me to go and doing the things you want me to do at that point in time you're obligated to take care of me i mean that's what i gathered from the book of habakkuk anyway but see we're time for it you know what people look at the things going on in the world and they say it's terrible and it is there's destruction in every hand we have inflation like we haven't had it in 40 years we look at what's going on in europe i look at what's going on in india because i still have ties with them i minister to them and i keep abreast of what's going on in that country and i was told by the guy that i work with i says we want you to come back but he says if you do he says it's going to be real real difficult for us to take you around because of the laws that they now have passed okay um [Music] but you know when when i look i i watched my wife as she gave birth to our children oh yeah everything was fine all of a sudden she says hey um it's time give me the hospital well i'm going to finish my no no it's time but no no it's time yes yes ma'am yes ma'am yes ma'am i'm exaggerating but you know she knew i was going to do that well she didn't but when it's time for the birth it's a time of great pain brother branham talks about what what was the first what was that when and and in birth pains he says what was the first pain he said that was the first world war what was he said what was the second birth pain that was world war ii we're approaching the third birth pain he said that's going to be armageddon and the world has to be in the position and the condition to be able to for that all of a sudden to come into manifestation and take place so it will not get better it's if for the world it's destruction yes for the world it's time of a great sorrow that is true for the world it's going to be a great a great time of the sorrow and distress and misery and all the other things that go with it this is true but see for the bride no this is the time of our rapture this is the time for the changing of our body this is the time for the manifestation of the sons of god this is the time when i'm going to come into my full expression as the son of god the manifestation of the sons of god all of a sudden will come into the thing in a moment and twinkling of an eye my body will be changed after i've seen my loved ones come back for 30 or 40 days this is what i keep my eye on this this is the focus that i have because this world will not improve it cannot improve and so if i keep my eye on the goal if i keep my eye on on what god has set before me the glory that paul talked about that's going to be revealed in me if i keep my eye and my focus on that then then all the rest of the stuff it doesn't mean anything i added this note to today and in matthew 25 it talks about um it talks about the the fault the wise and the foolish virgins and i was looking at this and i began to well lord you know what you know we were talking about the glory that shall be revealed in us and but all of a sudden it goes on there he says the voice he said he said see a cry came out he said behold the bridegroom cometh and to me that was the message and brother brown and when he began his ministry what was he doing he was trying to tell us the bridegroom is coming the bridegroom is coming make yourself ready but it goes on and says well the bridegroom terry they all slumped all foolish the boys and food as they all slumbered and slept but then at the midnight hour all of a sudden it came hey he's here trim your lamps the wise had oil the foolish did not brother branham types this with the denominational churches and i'm not going to dispute that point but to me it says the bridegroom came those that were ready went into the marriage and then the door was shut to me this is the time of the rapture he is righteous as righteous he's as filthy as filthy and when the door is shut the door is shut there's no no more entry into that and so when i when i look at us as the bride of jesus christ it comes down to the question do you have oil because sometimes pretty soon it's going to be too late there will come a time when all of a sudden the door will be set when we see the dead in christ rise it's over when that happens it is over and if you don't have it and you're not ready you will be left behind i can almost guarantee that and so now is the time in the preparation now is the time that the door is still open now is the time when the holy spirit is still available now is the time for you to make your calling in your election sure now is the time for you to sit there and and so and and so dedicate yourself to jesus christ and and ask for a refilling or ask for whatever it is you need to be able to strengthen you for what is coming because what is coming is not going to be easy habakkuk had to come to the realization if he was destitute if he had nothing yet he would still worship god with as if he had if he possessed everything and i told those in india he says it's going to come a time you when you probably will not have anything and but you will still work will you still worship god will you still devote yourself to god will you still get together in church will you still offer up praises and adoration to god as if you possess everything because this is to me and this is my opinion if you don't like it that's fine but to me this is my opinion this is where we're going this is what's coming there's there's there's a glory that's to be revealed in us and that that's what i look forward to that is that is my focus that is the end of the road that is that is the end of my race that i'm that i'm that i'm running but i also realize that regardless of what comes tomorrow i will still worship my god as if i possess all things when i was in we were in in switzerland my wife and i had been in india for probably about two and a half months um it was a very difficult trip for us my wife became very very sick i wasn't doing much better and so switzerland they had easter meetings and we had a plan to go and so we arrived there when we got there shirley had to go to bed because she didn't have enough strength to get up to to get up to to eat or do anything when the meat when their easter meeting starts i says well can you go to the meetings i says well yeah she'll try and so we got her in the car we got her there got her into bed and i went down to the brothers and i said my my wife needs prayer i mean she's not doing good at all and i was afraid that she was going to lose her okay and that's that was my mentality at that point and so i went down before they had the meetings and i poured my heart out to god because god you don't take her i rely on her too much she's a part of me and god heard my prayer and she began to mend and anyway there was a service and at the end of the service and i was still tore up in myself and so i was going to go up and and i think shirley was down there at the meeting at the time and anyway as they were people were exiting the the auditorium all of a sudden one lady she had a seizure or something i forget what and there was probably about 15 20 people between me and and the sister well there was right now eight or ten ministers around here praying for her and i figured well as a minister i probably should go and you know add mine to theirs and but then i looked at the situation i asked myself what can i do can i heal her the answer is no can i encourage her well yeah but the realization came that had to come from inside of her she had to have the willingness she had to have the the ability the desire to fight until she had the desire to fight satan would continue to do what she was doing what he was doing to her and i could not give her that i could not give her i could not place within her the desire to fight and i look at what's coming to the world now i'm asking you the same thing do you have the willingness do you have within you the desire to fight do you have enough of the unction of the holy spirit in you that when satan comes and attacks you you are willing to stand toe to toe with him and punch him in the face and fight it you're not going to get there by laying it back you're not going to get there by sitting back and wait letting somebody else do it no this has to come from inside of the individual i was in vietnam and one guy got a what do we call a sucking chest when a bullet went through his lung cavity well we had hundreds of those almost all of them lived but this one guy was so despondent and so discouraged he did not want to live and he died and another guy he got hit with something and he got burned over 50 percent of his body massive burns then he got an infection and that infection should have killed him but he wanted to live there was within him the the the the desire the the fight if you will just know i am going home and i am going to be with my family and i'm going to see my kids and i'm going to live a regular life and i'm going to do this and i'm going to do this and i'm going to and i am not going to die here he lived because there was within him the desire to fight there was within him something that says no i am not going to give up i am going to press the battle until i can be i can become and i can do and i can go where i want to go but see that has to now come inside of every single one of us we are at the end time we can look at what's coming we can look at the glory that's to be revealed in us and we can rejoice in those things and we can keep our focus on that and let the world go by and let the world do what the world is doing but when it comes down to to satan when coming down to doing battle with him you have to be willing to fight you have to have the gumption or whatever it is and you're within your own selves and no i am not going to submit to this i'm not going to lay down and die no satan i'm going to sit there i'm going to carry it through until i can i can see you physically and i can punch your lights out there has to come within ourselves that strong of a desire that we no matter what comes our way we will fight into until we will succeed until we will approach until we will get to the end i am looking for the changing of my body i believe that could be at any time that is what motivates me that that's where i keep my focus but see now it has to come to within every single one of you and i can't judge you and i there's nothing i cannot impart within you the desire to fight i cannot i can impart unto you knowledge i can impart unto you i can impart unto you encouragement but until you have within yourself the desire to fight when you look at the people that go running the races are the guys running the race and well yeah i'll get there eventually yeah yeah it's no big thing you know if i come in the 104th out you know 124 people oh that's all right it doesn't matter no if but the ones that are winning are the ones that have it within themselves this is no i'm going to be number one i am going to finish the race and i'm not going to finish in last place no i'm going to finish up front and so they will apply themselves and they will strain within themselves and they will they will put all of their energies into into winning a race which they have been set before them and paul in philippians he says not as though i had all retained either were already perfect but i follow after that i might apprehend that for which also i am apprehended of christ jesus brethren i count on myself to apprehend it but this one thing i do i forget all those things which are behind and i reach forth unto those things which are before and i press towards the mark for the prize of the high calling of god in dry jesus press means to apply all of your energies you have a focus on one thing and that's the end of the end of the race that you're going to finish that you're going to complete paul had to have this all of his life even when he was shipwrecked and beaten and stoned and all the other things he says no none of this bothers me he says because i have a race that i've been placed before me and i'm going to run that race regardless of the obstacles i am going to run that race and i'm going to complete the i'm going to apprehend that which god has apprehended me for but see now this has to come in every one of our lives you have to have that desire and without the desire where will you be next week next month where will you be when the rapture takes place i'm not trying to i'm i'm not trying to discourage but i'm trying to i'm trying to get a reality a wake-up call you are not going to win by sitting back and doing nothing the only way that you're going to win is you're going to have to apply yourself in the scriptures and in prayer and all of the other things you're going to have to apply yourself that you that you are determined that you're going to run the race that god has set before you and you are going to finish that race because god has ordained for you to do that like i say you're the only one that can answer you're the only one that can answer what's inside of you yes my sure have we been i've been discouraged sure have i had my my days when i'm down and out yeah and then god taps me in the shoulder enough for pity party get up we got work to do okay you know so you get up and you start and you start living again you start applying yourself you start doing the things that you know you should be doing you get back into reading your bible you get back into listening to the tips of the messages you get back into just doing the thing which god has ordained for me to do from the beginning but as i look at the world going on around i realize i cannot have an off day anymore because if i have another off day what happens if he comes on that off day no it's time to press the battle it's time to finish the race it's time to look at the end of the goal that jesus that god has set before us and run with patience the race that has been laid before us god bless you amen wonderful message amen how many feel like encouraged tonight i'm man i'm man i'm man it's unbelievable we still have to deal with justification and he's getting into sanctification back and forth back and forth so i need to to talk to the gps and find out because he keeps insisting on sanctification a lot if you are spiritual you can catch a roof serving it's right there amen we don't have any more time decision is powerful and decision can turn the things and the event in life you know it bothers me when a young man graduated and don't know what he's going to do wow it's a sickness in the message all over the message it's a sickness among the young people do you want me to continue you want me to continue you graduated in 2010 where are you today nothing no money in the bank account credit card debt change 20. different work nothing amen it borders me and i told somebody i say until you take a decision yourself from your heart that desire have to come from your heart because god will look at your heart and you will come to the altar 20 times and it's not going to change you the reason why you're not changing because the desire is not there you're not ready for the change yet you're not ready for what god wants to do in your life yet you still think you have time you don't want to let things go that's the reason why you have a problem amen but if you can take a genuine decision i cannot teach you on that you have to come from yourself that you say enough is enough i am done i am not going to go any more with this if it comes from your heart if you really mean it god will come down do you hear me brother branham went to a mental institution and he met a woman she looks normal but she had a mental issue and many people look normal today but they have a real big problem amen brother branham told the woman go ahead and pray she knelt down and stopped praying she prayed she prayed lord jesus this this this and walk up and say i finished brother branham say that didn't work you go back again and stop praying amen she stopped praying she stopped praying and brother branham said suddenly she hit something and when she woke up brother brandon never spoke about i don't know i might have not seen the quote yet about him praying for that woman that woman just rose again and by the brandon look at her he said that was it amen amen brother branham was just standing there witnessing that woman getting her own deliverance amen if you don't have that desire in your heart you will keep spinning and spinning and spinning and spinning and spinning and the years don't wait for you before you know it you're 25 you're 30 years old you're 35 years old and when you look you didn't go nowhere and the people that start with you you're going to see them married they have kids the children are grown up they have 10 years old children you are still hanging there because you don't want to take a decision you don't want to go to that altar and you don't want to die if you get in that brazen altar and you really mean it from your heart amen you really desire it from your heart not from the head many decision comes from the head i'm not talking about the head but from your heart brother branham preach the time of decision if you take a decision from your heart you say lord i cannot help myself but there is one thing there is a desire in me i don't want to go anymore without this amen if you stay in your prayer closet if you don't meet god then something is wrong somewhere amen that god will always meet you if you really mean it amen amen there is no more time you heard the brother talking about even in the message where is the oil where is the old amen i found out in the message people that are very serious with god it doesn't take much for you to see them you will even think they're more older than you because of the way they're serious with god they you are 20 years old they are 20 years old but when you talk to them you will think they are 35 and you're 20. it's because of how serious they are with god god will transform that person will bring that person to a higher responsibility until you would look at them and you look like how old are you are you 40 no they're not 40 it is the message in them doing that amen and to be that you got to be serious with this message and you got to take a genuine decision from your heart to stop playing games stop playing games in church stop following preachers stop playing game from one church to another or with your friend in school or in college or whatever forget about all of that take a full decision you will regret i told somebody i say if you really mean it from your heart you will look back and regret all the years you spend you can give somebody four years they do nothing you can give somebody else four years they come up with a bachelor degree one did something one was just playing around you ask them what they're doing they're in this major tomorrow the job they're in this major measure tomorrow the job in this major tomorrow the job they start working and then they stop working then they go back they're just spinning and you look five years seven years ten years is gone without going nowhere if you were serious with god that 10 years you could have seen what god would have accomplished in your life you will be probably preaching the gospel winning souls left and right and doing things for the kingdom or you will be a mother in the home raising kids and showing other mothers an example what to be in a marriage life so in my sound hard i'll have to rock again with that justification we got to make sure we are ready for the rapture amen if you don't know what the brother is talking tonight that manifestation if you have not make your life serious with god it's not going to happen amen we love you but love is corrective i cannot back up until i see you all make it to the other side amen when you are prospering when you happy when your spiritual life is where you're supposed to be with god i am happy because we did what we're supposed to do amen aren't you tired about your life aren't you tired just let it go release god god has been waiting all this time to help you he has been there he has been waiting you've been on his way you've been doing things the way you wanted you've been blocking him blocking him blocking him brother branham even said that the holy ghost was even blocked tied by the creeds and things like that so a lot of stuff can block the holy ghost until the holy ghost cannot operate the way he's supposed to be amen but god is bringing you freedom what the brother is preaching this is the mark of our high calling this is what god is calling us for god is not calling us to be at the altar today at the altar tomorrow at the altar today at the altar tomorrow that's not you go to the altar one time you die one time and you keep moving and everything else is bloated up all the ordinance all the past saying brother branham say they are completely removed from you you don't look at that and you move forward going on to the holy of holies where you have the communion show me a man or a woman that is really in love with somebody and who want to wait before they get married i heard even people saying may jesus wait until i get married before he comes back because they love one another so much but how can you be married to jesus christ and the signs of the coming of the lord are coming and you now afraid you want to say god hold on hold on i still have a project i still have to buy 10 houses i still have to do this before you come you're not in love with christ if you are really in love with christ you can't wait to be united with your husband that is the sign of a true love amen when rebecca when elias spoke to rebecca rebecca never even have uh i mean an email from uh isaac she didn't have a facebook where she can see isaac she didn't have a face time all she heard is a message coming from a messenger but that message was so powerful until the home of rebecca became uncomfortable when they told her just stay for 10 days she could not even stay 10 days if they tell you i mean stay home 10 days with your parent probably you will say let me stay ten days rebecca say no i wanna go did you see that man no have you seen him before no rebecca when in decent time we know how jesus looked we seen his picture we seen the cloud coming you know who you're gonna meet in the air you're not gonna get there and say who's jesus i never seen him you already have a representation you know exactly how jesus looked like the sun are coming for jesus and you want to hang on to your relationship because you have a body or a friend or something in this world that is tying you up that's why god is shaking everything amen stock market down this going up the gas price going up until you don't know where to put your hope again then you can look up your redemption is joined now amen amen make a decision young man stop wasting time you already wasted three years you wasted five years you wasted seven years you wasted ten years you're not going nowhere if we check your bank account young people zero sum of a draft what do you do with the money nothing it's just spending spending spending spending spinning spending nothing amen because all of that is just the attribute of sin you have not given your life to god give him the preeminence he will take care of everything he will stabilize your life he will give you peace if you need that husband the husband will show up if you need the wife the wife will show up seek first the kingdom of god when you reach that kingdom of god then everything else will be taken care of and even if god is bringing those things but still you are looking up waiting for the coming of the lord if he comes i leave everything i'm going amen because you're not tied to this world anymore you dead like a roof and you want to go to a different land amen let's stand there don't waste your time don't waste your time god is calling for a higher deeper intimate relationship with him amen don't get used to get to church and come out and just go go home and ponder on what the brother was preaching ponder where you are examine yourself check your own life and see where you are if you know where you're supposed to be just keep moving until you get where you're supposed to be at least you know that if the lord comes today i'm in peace with god like paul said when we are justified we had peace with him that's where we want you to be let's pray heavenly father lord we thank you again for your grace for your love and for your mercy father thank you for using our brother tonight in a powerful way to speak to your children and to encourage encourage your children and father to stir and to work those that were sleeping and slumbering because the time is very very close father many times we heard sermon preach after sermon that the lord is coming that the time is closed but what we are experiencing now and the way the direction the world is moving on there is no doubt lord that we're not gonna last again in this world longer father we don't want anybody to be left behind like the brother stated once the dead in christ are raised up once that blood is no more on the mercy seat the door will be completely closed and father whoever will be left will be doomed for the tribulation lord jesus christ we pray that you stir the heart of the people may you remove that stone that is blocking that unbelief completely lord that the word of god can penetrate where he can father reach to the deeper to the soul of your children and wake them up lord until you can bring them to that place where they can make peace with you lord father may you strengthen your manservant that you use tonight lord and father may you

father we thank you for speaking to us and we thank you for healing the sick lord and we are committing lord father the remainder of the week unto the hand and embedding lord father as we ambly ask it in the name of jesus christ amen you can lead with one song amen in fact the lord wanted me to sing this song tonight but i was trying not to sing but the preaching that came brought me back to the song amen i don't know if we know this song but we might learn it tonight amen now i have that everlasting joy within since he came and took away my sin that moment that he blessed me made me truly oh
