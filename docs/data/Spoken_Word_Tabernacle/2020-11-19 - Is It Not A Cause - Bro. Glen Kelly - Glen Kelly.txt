everyone said amen you may have your seats as we pick up the offering um there's a little song that i don't know many of us know it it's it's justified but um as we were going through the book of esther and um touching on justification and seeing how that leads that leads to rapturing faith amen just this song came back to my heart [Music] amen seeing how the revelation of jesus christ justifies us when we recognize him it tells us who we are and we are just as virgin born as he is totally inviolated i'm going to sing the chorus and we just learn the chorus quickly justified [Music]

and you can't see what we see him in but it's not for him it's for us amen the ones who can recognize christ are the ones who were with him before the world began that's the only way we could recognize him no we we knew him before and we recognized him our eyes open up that identifies us just as sinless as he always was amen praise god i didn't ask does anyone have a special that they wanted to give to the lord tonight sisters praise the lord amen hallelujah amen i'll sing this song to the glory of god this evening he is exalted the king is exalted on high and i will praise him he

about a little crow he called johnny crow and johnny crow was tied to that tree for so long and when the farmer came and turned him loose his mind was still tied to the tree we don't want to be like that we want to let go the lord set us free lord justified us leave everything behind give everybody grace forgive everybody forgive yourself take your forgiveness and let go and let god have his wonderful way maybe i'll stand let go and let god have his wonderful [Music] his way you will find all your sorrow will vanish your night turn today let go and let god have let's sing it again as we call our pastor oh let go and let god way oh let go and let god [Music] let [Music] amen praise the name of the lord amen everybody happy tonight okay everybody happy tonight amen blessed be the name of the lord how many are still meditating from sunday service you're still meditating the holy spirit is still speaking amen praise the name of the lord we appreciate all our family members tonight we don't have visitors in this church we always have family member so you home make yourself home pull on the word of the lord and we trust it's going to be a blessing tonight next week is thanksgiving we want to be mindful of the sisters who probably have to cook for thanksgiving so that has been said instead of having service on wednesday next week only well i will repeat this on sunday and we will send the text on monday i believe a mass text just to make sure everybody got it so next wednesday we will not have service here tonight our service will be on tuesday instead so next week we will have service on tuesday night not wednesday amen so wednesday the sister can cook the turkey for thanksgiving amen praise the name of the lord so we want to be mindful of that we don't want to come here and everybody rushing at home and trying to gather food and everything so we're still gonna have service then the following week everything resumed back on wednesday everybody got that i got some reading for you amen okay for this coming weekend lord's willing if you would in preparation for the service you can read first samuel chapter 15. amen we are still on the same subject the three fists of king a hazarist and the two banquet of esther you just saw last sunday from verse one to four we could not even finish it amen so first samuel chapter 15 that's your first chapter so make yourself you uh familiar with it the second one will be esther chapter three that's where we are don't go to chapter four because chapter three is loaded amen esther chapter 3 then the last one will be matthew 25. we need those three scriptures for sunday if you want to make yourself ready go ahead just read it meditate upon it prayer and i believe the holy spirit can even begin to unfold to you before even we get on sunday if you're still struggling a little bit with the book of life i just caught that matthew 25 is the book of life amen when you read matthew 25 there is three parable there is the parable of the ten virgins he gives you the foolish virgin and the wise virgin amen then the second parable is the parable when jesus spoke about the man that gave his servant talent he gave one ten talent the second one five talent and the last one was one amen and two of them multiply or gain their talent by a hundred so the bible says that god gave them those talents according to their ability amen so when god places a gift in your life god already see you that you are capable to take that gift to its maximum amen because the bible says that the one who have ten gained ten more a hundred percent amen the one who had five again also five so the one that had won had also the potential to gain warner but he neglected the gift and he was thrown out in the outer darkness where there is whipping and gnashing of teeth again you have your bride there the two there is two categories of them still in the broad we are not on the same level amen that's the bride and then you will see the wicked one who took the talent and buried that that's your book of life and the last parable is the parable word jesus is saying as a shepherd is dividing the sheep from the goat all those three parables are your three categories that are included in the book of life one is the bride one is the foolish virgin and the righteous of matthew 25 which are the sheep and another one are gonna have their name in the book of life but their name will be raised and whoever is not in matthew 25 his name was now written in the lamb's book of life you have your four category all of them in one chapter amen and the goat the bible says that he talked to the one on the left he said depart from me go to everlasting fire that was prepared for the devil if you recall jesus called judah a devil so that's that character that that specie that is religious that can get anointed have a talent from the master but does not do anything about that talent amen so if you have a gift in this church put it for the lord if you have a beautiful voice put it for the lord if god blesses you with something put it to work once you put it to work recognizing that the gift came from him an anointing will drop on you to take that gift all the way to its maximum capacity amen first samuel chapter 15 esther chapter 3 and matthew chapter 25 dealing with the book of life we need something in matthew 25 to help us unlock something in esther we have brother kelly tonight it's back to back [Laughter] amen we have brother kelly i just kept this month for the local so we go back to back back to back then we reopen and call the brother from our side because we believe in the 5-4 ministry so brother kelly will be ministering tonight you know brother kelly everybody knows his star let's pull on the word of god and get a blessing from heaven tonight only believe only believe [Music] only believe all things [Music] praise the lord amen i tell you it was getting so enticing i was about to take this tie off and give it to you brother steve you gotta be ready to run home now amen and start digging but god bless you y'all hear the if the lot has fell on me tonight so uh we thank you for your grace and your mercy is always in precious opportunity to come before god's precious children it's an honor so you pray for me i'm never comfortable up here so you pray for me let him come down and have his way and i'll get out of my way our hearts and mind the clear let us pal lord god we thank you for your grace your mercy lord jesus we thank you lord god for an opportunity just to come before your precious bride lord god father those lord god that had up that wanted to be here tonight but wasn't able lord god wherever they may be send the word of grace to comfort them father we know it's in the middle of the week lord god but they pressed their way out to hear from you lord jesus and you've never failed us because you said we're two and three we're gathered in thy name that you will be in the midst of us so lord god we bring every demon forth unto subjection and because we come here in the name of the lord jesus christ and father by faith we claim it all done in jesus name we pray amen and amen um you may be seated this time it's just a little uh testimony i wanted this song so many people sing it you know and i just had an opportunity a brother send it to me and i want to ask david if he could just it's not long i think it's just a few minutes and then we'll get right into the words are you ready brother dave i want to see this come to praise our king in 1904 revival swept across wales god made himself known in a very special and personal way after the revival a welshman ventured halfway across the world to india and he trekked up the mountains towards a remote village in the east he was told go back the tribe in that village are famously violent but the welshman ignored the warnings because even these savage headhunters should have the opportunity to hear about the mercy of god one tribesman and his family heard the gospel and received jesus as their savior the good news was too good to keep to themselves and they shared the gospel with others in the tribe the chief was very angry and he had the tribe's man and his family dragged before the village stop following jesus the chief demanded the tribe's man replied no i have decided to follow jesus i am not turning back the chief was furious and killed the tribesman's children stop following jesus the chief insisted the tribesman replied though none go with me i still will follow no turning back the chief showed no mercy and he killed the tribesman's wife now you will stop following this jesus the chief said the tribe's man looked the chief in the eyes and replied the cross before me the world behind me no turning back the chief could not believe his years and he killed the tribesmen jesus said if a grain of wheat dies it bears much fruit and that day many of the villagers who witnessed the persecution of that tribesman and his family also decided to follow jesus even the chief himself became a follower of jesus christ the tribesman's last words became the song of the village and today it is sung all around the world i have decided to follow jesus see what our god did in our time here now got my glasses god help me hallelujah okay you understand we're gonna go to two passages of scriptures and we'll look at uh ephesians six and ten hallelujah but steve started there and and we'll also be going to uh first samuel 17. prestige started talking about samuel i said uh-oh i'll just have ephesians 6 and 10 amen finally my brethren be strong in the lord and in the power of his might put on the whole armor of god that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil we know we wrestle not against flesh of flesh and blood but against principalities and powers and against the rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness we're in high places okay and then this um first samuel 17 and we'll read the uh [Music] we'll read the uh 20 uh 29th first but we'll be working from 17 over to uh 29. praise the lord okay that first samuel 29 amen he said and and david said what have i done now and done is there not a cause you may be seated you know we're looking to listen to a message there um you know brother brown he preached the message the great warrior david but you know here we want to look at uh got the inspiration from it but our topic tonight is there not a cause you know so the times that we're living in we can look at that and say broadly is it not a cause you know so that's why we know now more so than ever it's time for the gospel to be spread out now is that right because we know by what the lord has been doing for us in this hour here now and what he has unfolded is really nothing left but basically the rapture is that right okay because god as we know is just it can happen any day and anytime but god has given us commissions and you know so that's why we're rejoicing we're thanking god for all the mysteries we're thanking god for the things that he's uh unfolding and brother uh uh steve i wasn't that sardius age and i'll tell you i might get a chance to read it tonight but i'm telling you god hid that up under there what you working with he hid that up under that sardis with that wheat and that tear he hid it and that saudi and say it's in there you got to go back and read what the pastor told you to read is in there okay but uh before i get ahead of myself let me read this to you it says now the cause of cause you think we're gonna show you how mighty our god is tonight is that right just four words of exhortation i listen to part of the message suddenly i didn't get a chance to listen to listen to it again i like to go through it twice sometimes three times because there's so much food in there you have to understand what god is richly doing for us in this hour here now you know he says we know because he says malachi i mean revelations 10 and 7. he said when that voice come all the mystery shall be finished is that right the god has to fulfill his word so look how much he loves you so we have someone that loved him and loved his people so much he hid them in a row as a deacon for a while is that right he hid them in that role and you see who know the mind of god no one knows the mind of god but noun is bringing his bride he's bringing his people forward well the party called beautiful message last wednesday i tell you it's getting that's what god is bringing us into so we know in this hour here now and it's not by power it's not by might but it's by my spirit say to the lord we're going to show you what goliath why david had a revelation why the prophet of god said you always come in and be praised up to be spiritually minded if you're not prayed up you won't catch the mind of god you're coming in with a car in your mind but we have to recognize in this hour here now jesus has come to be lifted up the platform is for jesus is that right where the caucus is is where jesus is where the carcass is where the word is is that right so noun is our here now we got many souls out there god said the harvest is plenty in the laborers is few is that right he commissioned we had commissioned the first commission and the last commission is that right they'll go here all the world preaching the gospel is that right telling them but the first thing we have to realize there's a lot of hard-hearted people out there there's a lot of unbelief people out there okay so we have to deal with these things but we'll show you the way that the lord has given what he has given us in this hour here and now you just pray with me cause it's something that produces in an effect result or consequence it says the interest of a person or group engaged in a struggle all right so we're going to see about david and we're going to look at goliath a familiar passage of the scriptures here tonight but we pray that you got your spiritual caps on and realize that who david knew who he was i believe when the prophet of god preached this message he was seeing us is that right he was preaching he was seeing far off he was seeing in the laodicea age he was sin because the things that that was being implemented to david is that right it's only to be implemented in this time because the bible said he was called by god he was anointed by god he was elected by god he was chosen by god he was positioned by god that's what oh brother steve he was hitting right in that area about them gifts he was in that area is that right those gifts are calling are still without repentance is that right the gift is already there inside of you huh hallelujah through samuel 29 he said david said what have i now done is there not a cause before we start reading here in 17 let's give you a preview we know that god that as the lord had been sharing with us months ago they didn't say they didn't want the word of the prophet but it really wasn't the word of the prophet because the word of the prophet is the word of god so they really didn't want god that's all the holy spirit was saying sunday morning that the battle is not ours but it's who is god is that right you know about that we're looking at amateur i see why he was working with that amalekite he was the grand son of esau and you know he saw hated jacob is that right so we got to understand what we're really up against we're not up against flesh and blood you're up against demon forces you're up against jealousy you're up against envy you're up against strife these demon forces is right now they're now so we have to understand we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principality and power in wickedness where in high places so he instructed you he instructed me to put on what the whole armor of god is that right and so you and me able to withstand the wiles of the devil in the end time is that right but we're going to show you no demon forces should be able to stand up against god's children now you push it back anything because you said what i received you my brother by the mercies of god and for getting out of god's mercy forgetting not god's benefits i can heal i hear i'm a healer i'm a jehovah raphae i'm a healer of all thy diseases all died that sickness nothing can sit up in the presence of god nothing sits there we just bring a few words of encouragement tonight but every time i get up there i've been waiting for this message brother steve because the devil don't stand a chance is that right no sir the devil don't stand the chance with this hair you don't have to be afraid of no demon forces speak the word in god on it according to his will hallelujah he said now look let's look at uh chapter 17 and let's start at verse 17. i'll tell you what for the sake of time let's come down to verse 20. he says and david rose up early in the morning and left the sheep with the keeper and looked and went as jesse had commanded him and he came to trench as host was going forth to fight and shout for the battle now remember they got themselves in this situation because they started looking at the world they did not want what god gave them they wanted a king so you have to understand children you children are here you're special you're just like shattered me shaking have been the goat the devil recognizes something different than you the devil recognizes something special there so you don't look at we don't want the things of the world that's why you come up in here see that's why i said david was positioned when they come in i cannot take brother uh uh abel's position brothers john's position is that right god have anointed them to be in that position so they have to understand when understanding comes the confidence comes you know you get around and i said lord where did these funny feelings and things come from i remember brother branham spoke in the message i know in that message he said i know he said you have more troubles when you become a christian because all those funny feelings and different things he says you don't know what they are he said you're not supposed to understand what they are he said then this wouldn't be faith your walk wouldn't be faith so the just we live by what faith in the promised word of god so they didn't want what god gave them they started looking around there filthy looking and you know what it wasn't even the people that wanted it it was it was the leaders it was the elders you let down the bars you let down the bars that's how the goats got in you let down the bars you reason with sin you reason with sin that's how the goats get in he ain't coming up in here the devil ain't coming up in here because god's gonna unturn everything he's gonna call it out he's gonna pick it out because this is the church of jesus christ we are not reason with it though we don't have to we gonna get to david just bear with us when we come around in him and they got there they looked around and they wanted a king and he got around in there samuel he got upset he never asked him for no money if you go to the chapter right before that he just prayed for him he just prayed he asked god to have mercy on them he's just praying for him and the next chapter they come right over there and here come the leaders one the king is that right they start looking around in here that's why your songs that's right brother abel i love you with these songs you're singing the songs got to come to glorify god we don't want no radio song that's not going to glorify jesus christ ah you say i'm home you say i'm home y'all gonna get used to me hallelujah i got no use for the devil no no use for the devil at all just when you come in here why because it drives it out it drives the demon forces the way you say i have my times of ups and downs sometimes when no one was around god came and spoke these words to me it says what praises confuse the enemy see when you're going through something when you struggle through something just start praising the lord just lift him up on high think about the goodness of the lord and god had come down got to move that demon forces so they didn't want what god gave them they didn't want the bread they didn't want the manna from heaven they didn't want it they didn't want no one to leave they wanted a king they started looking around and they wanted that king so samuel he got burdened his heart got heavy but he said samuel that's okay you go tell them what that king is going to do you tell us what they're going to do to you you tell them you go out in that world they're going to use you they're going to abuse you they're going to try to pull you as a prostitute they kind of use you for drugs they're going to get you to smoke with them they want to get you to drink with them they want to get you to party with them god told them tell them he said they're going to take your children they're going to use them for labor they're going to work with in the fields they're going to use them in a way that's not according to god but god's not going to get glory from it but he said samuel but they're not rejecting you samuel they're rejecting me so they got there and they moved on and you know saul they wanted saul as their leader but saul couldn't bring them unto where god had saul had predestinate for them to be god had given them a promise god had brought them out of egypt with a mighty powerful hand that's why the prophet of god spoke the eagles stirred her nest is that right when they come around and then and said the eagle had never went on a flight see some of you had never went on a flight like this so you come up in here and you start letting the devils tell you murmuring ain't complaining oh my heart was heavy for my pastor sunday morning let me tell you something from now up into malachi huh [Applause] there has been no open vision until malachi 4. luke 17 30. revelations 10 7 and the devil will creep in and get you to murder the complaint that he told us and said in first corinthians 10 he gave us an example of things not to do [Music] and you come in there you try to rush them you let it sink in we ambush the devil tonight whoo it sink in and then all that labor through this word but stephen i got around and then witness sardis i couldn't go to bed i just started to be my god that was the dark age that was the dark age and where he's working in esther god hit it in there you got to catch a spiritual mind about the wheat and the tear so you got to you got to realize i mean things that just opened up like it never opened up before so you don't want to put pressure on them you don't want to come in there and and and and all that laboring my heart my heart feels when i know i was self-employed at one time i worked at night also and i come in the end serving the lord and doing prison ministries only god no way he could do that it has to be god i guess god gave me grace to say that off of my heart then hallelujah anyhow he said now look when they come around in there and they look and he says now when when david now had to go with david his father jesus sent him out there with some goods and to find out how they were doing in the battle now you look at this here we're familiar i know a lot of the children are familiar with goliath but we realized let's look at the spiritual aspects what they were real what the philistines was really trying to do to god's people then look and see what they were really trying to do to god's army let's see what was really going on here i may not have all the time to get to but we're going to start moving help me lord i like you brother steve see brother steve you know what i like the best place i mean the best part of flying on the plane i like the runway i love the runway huh [Applause] [Music] 20 and david rose up early in the morning and left the sheep he with that keeper and took and took and went as jesse had commanded him and he came to the trench as the host was going forth to the flight and they shouted through and shout for the battle he says for for israel and the philistines had put the battle in a ray see army against the army now they wanted this valley that they was getting ready to line it up they was getting it in order so you have to understand god has an order and people don't want to follow god's word on if you want to be victorious you got to follow god's order when you're going out the first person you know they had to repent and be baptized in the name of jesus christ for the remission of your sins is that right and you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost but look at it we're going to read some stuff about david in a minute so just be prayerful with me he said now look he said in a raid the army against army he said then david left his carriage in the hand of the keeper of the carriage and ran into the army and came and saluted his brethren and as he talked with them behold there came up the one the champion of the philistines of gath huh goliath he said goliath by name now look at this here he said array now array is to arrange or to set or put something in order and get it ready for this battle is that right god has came and now he's got us ready to get up out of here it's about time for the flight though he's telling us where we are at is that right some of you wasn't around in the 60s this is the second pope that i mean separate second catholic president that we ever had is that right the things are in position for them they know god knows what kind of pressure he brother steve is not just telling you that pressure is going to come a pressure is it is going to come and it's basically on a lot of people now but you're not really out there mentally and spiritually it's already on them so we already know what did he say first he come by the way anti-christ is that right he'll come as the antichrist we have the jesuit pope that's there he's speaking uh like a what like a false prophet is that right now he's been speaking like a false prophet you got to catch these prophecies that the prophet of god told us to be careful i mean be watchful for is that right just bear with me he said now look it was array that they said now verse 23 he said and his to his talk with him behold there came out the champion of the philistines of goliath by name out of the armies of the philistines and spake according to the same words and david heard them he says in all the men of israel when they saw the man fled from him and were sore afraid and the first thing they know now they're looking at the natural but you're not looking at the promise is that right so we went to the place sunday we were there in their ministry and the last two places we've been [Music] just sitting there with masters on their face and i'm sitting in there now there mrs church is getting ready to rapture out of here and you're sitting there with those masses on your face and you want a sinner and believe that you're god as great as this god that we saw with these heathens huh you want them to believe that our god is jehovah raphae the lord thy god i can heal of all of thy diseases we want it we want them to believe them we want them to believe god can deliver them from drugs god can deliver them from alcohol see you've got to understand your commission that's why the prophet of god said earnestly contending for the faith that was once delivered to the saints why because the first commission when he said peter john come what follow me i'm going to teach you how to win souls peter ah that was the first message that was given to them huh we want to read some what the prophet said here too but it's being neglected [Music] it's being neglected and this is our hour so god can get glory he's going to get the glory right now he's preparing us why to go out and win these souls or whatever like brother steve said whatever gets god put inside of you you let god use it we'll read it in a minute is there any brother telling me let's see tell you what the prophet said hope you still love me when i get finished i don't know why i'm going this way but i'm following him he said now look he said he said and all the men of israel when they saw the man they fled with him were so afraid he said and the men of israel said have ye seen this man that has come surely to defile israel israel is he come up and it shall be that the man who killeth him the king will enrich him with great riches and will give him his daughter and make his father's house free in israel he said and they respect to the men that stood by him saying what shall be done to the man that killed this philistine and taken away the reproach from israel ah he says for who is this uncircumcised philistine and that he should defile the what the armies of the living god now there's all this right here god is doing let me see what god is doing for us see god has given us signs god has given us the wonders he's a brother polycarp that god watched over his daughter there last week is that right the angel of the lord who came i think brother steve prayed for a brother and god delivered him from his migraine headache is that right we got the testimonies but david now he's got his heart got heavy it's because when you go around and you see them just sitting there with those fear demons doing them i wish i could bring you some more pictures and just show you those little those souls out there that need this gospel right now that is struggling in this hour here now bear with me array a army a army look at the hebrew before we go any further let me read this an arrangement critically a pile specifically a military array it's a fight be set in order placed rank in a row see you got churches in there don't want the fivefold ministry that's the order of god and when god put that order in there why i send you an apostle pastor teacher and evangelist for the perfecting of the saints for the working of the ministry for what for edifying edifying see that's what kind of pricked my heart when i saw and i heard brother steve said we're in a war we're in a war we're in a war but you got to understand how to fight this war it's a spiritual war so when they went out to jesus when he fought that war he showed them how to deliver them from certain demons he told them about about his authority of having the authority of having forgiveness just bear with me he said look because we went to a place it was medicine i won't say where this sunday and god saved some souls all of them was children it was all children struggling in this world today because if god they know this god that we serve we serve them for a year is able to save your soul we're telling we're able to save your soul they able to heal your body they to provide your needs your food your transportation your health it's a big struggle going on right there with them with these children they're around in there there's so many well let me read this here and i i don't want to get help me lord hallelujah he says in the and and he says defile the armies of the living god now we're talking about a army or ranking or order but here it's a spiritual definition of this when you go look in that army if you look up the hebrews i'mma read it to you it says disposing ranking in order is a pile of wood in order i won't have time to go through all those scriptures and go to judges in six you can go to genesis 22 and 9 you go to first samuel 17. it's a battle set in array but it's also it's lamps range in order that's something bruh steve you're gonna have to grab a hold of because it's in exodus 39 and 37. and where it ran you two is those candlesticks and then those candlesticks it took me to those church ages that's why i was telling you it's something god gave you in sardis and is therein is in and only god and only god can reveal the supernatural spiritual things what you're getting now don't be ungrateful don't start murmuring don't start looking at the time don't be concerned about these things now i don't know why i'm going this way but it's not even in my notes but because we have to recognize in this hour hour here now what god has commissioned us to do these are divine commandments he said look he said let me let you read it first turn to exodus 39. god want to slow it down let him slow it down have your way lord and we'll just read verse 36 and 37 it says the table and all the vessels thereof and the showbread the pure candlesticks with the lamps thereof even with the lamps to be set in order and all the vessels thereof and the oil were oil for light that was one this this is the order that god has brought us in now bill rebuilding this house god is built in this house spiritually he's building this house and in this candlesticks remember there was a type of those church ages he says i'll read i won't read all i already wanted to quote so y'all know that i'm i'm in line with what the prophet said he says the end of this verse he said let's read it this come out of the patmos vision in 60. he says and being turned i saw seven golden candlesticks he says in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks one like the son of man he says my did you notice the stars candlesticks lamps what does that mean what does this mean that the dispensation that we are living in is nighttime candles and lights and stars mean night he says and what does a star do it reflects the light of the sun until the sun returns blessed be the name of the lord and a true minister of god don't reflect some flashlight some match them some shock or burning he reflects the golden rays of the christ of the christ to the church that he is the same he's alive and he's shining on me he said that's the light he reflects the star reflects the light of the sun so we're reflecting the light of the son of god doing the same thing he did giving light what what kind of light the gospel lights look what he said here this is our prophet brother branham is here we still this is uh david the great mighty warrior it says it says we're speaking on the same thing that gifts and calling are without repentance it's god's election and for knowledge is what makes the thing so it says if we have a desire the bible said it's not it's not with him willeth or him that run us but it's god that showeth mercy it's not whether you will or whether you won't or whether you desire it it's whether it is god's will or not he says then we have to find out god's will and if it's that perfect we can find i mean we can just set our faith and to that and say this is it and we can run right on the way the will of god he said look what he said he says then that's what happened to pentecost he said that's what happened to you pentecost people when you thought well the rest of the churches they all go to shows he says their women cut their hairs off and they wear short dresses and say they're christians why can't we i don't know why i'm going this way but god knows god knows he said look i'm start jumping this is here brother branham said this here also he says and the great just in the same um message david this great warrior he says in the great fine millions of dollar churches i ask you something why you're building these churches with millions of dollars and preaching jesus christ is coming ain't that what jesus christ is coming and soon too he said he he said now what do we care about it he said let's go get people saved see that's my ministry that's all i've done in the last 25 years he also said if you try to preach or be like anybody else you are a hypocrite we got the goods we know god didn't make a man a homosexual we know god didn't make a man a lesbian we know god didn't make a man an alcoholic we know god didn't make that that that woman in that condition or a child we know god didn't make them that because we know that god said he's may we he made them in the image of his likeness so when now also then we know that they're really thirsting for god [Applause] look what he says he says why you building he says jesus christ is coming soon he says i don't get that do you he said i can't see it jesus is coming soon what do we care he said let's go and get people saved he said that's the main thing let's say everything our prophets say that's the main thing is saving souls if you're on those streets like i'm on those streets and you see them people are going out there they don't they don't know what's going to happen you have a catholic president our prophet told us these things we're not talking about the people we're talking about these systems we're talking about the rank we're talking about the order we're talking about the battle that we're in go ye all the world preach the gospel earnestly contend for the faith we got a god that's proven you got a guards of people that we got a testimony that can prove that the angel of the lord can protect your child from a bullet we get a testimony that we got testimony that god can pay your bills we got a testimony brother that god at the last minute will keep your insurance from going up and somebody claiming you're in short we got testimony god can god can deliver a lunatic god huh god can deliver someone that's homeless god can deliver someone from drugs god can deliver someone that needs a job god can deliver someone from their mind battles god can deliver someone from their sickness god can deliver someone that needs a job god can deliver someone that's tormented from their mind god can deliver [Applause] i seen those children i was about your heads and i told myself raise your hand i said you know you need your salvation god has spoken to you i don't know when they raised their hand all children their heads down parents heads was down and those children and you know if you don't think the pressure's coming i'll tell you for this message brother steve you stay right where you at god got you there i'm speaking what he sent me to do you're doing exactly what god got you to do you think the pressure god's telling him no man can't do what he's doing when i went and preached my sister's funeral it was 10 of us we have one sister and when i got over there and said you know what jesus christ is the son of god and he's god i'm not talking so much from someone on the street i'm not talking about a neighbor i'm talking about a first cousin that's under islamic belief and he said i had to tell the boys not to put a dagger in you you think this message is something like that i'm telling you it's real it's real the reproach is going to come we're going to see i can read you about martin i could read about columbus in them i was reading brother steve i'm telling you when god put that on your heart i just couldn't bear i was up all night read just read wasn't tired my wife tell you i ain't have a two hour sleep in the last two days for the glory of god i was just there i said lord and he was there and i just kept reading and you know from the reproach someone took for this message they took him and i can't remember which one it was brother steve i know restarted so i can't remember columbia one of them tied them to the tree and he said tie me to the tree let him follow me for the name of jesus christ and when the tree was full the tree swung around and fell on him and killed him it wasn't his time yet the reproach is going to come for this message that's why he was singing when they started talking about masters putting masses i love your testimony brother steve he said we're going to be okay because god didn't give us the spirit of fear but love peace joy in the sound mind he said none of these diseases none of these sickness is going to come upon you he said look he said now this is brother branham he said i haven't got nothing against seminaries they're all right he said but jesus never could neither never commissioned us to do that he never said bill the church would have seminaries he said he never said build hospitals or school but they're all right remember i have nothing against him he said but the very principle that he said for us to do we we've let down and took secondary we have we have built great hospitals schools other things a spiritual condition he said one of the men who passed by me around seeing a few places and said well we know where where there is divine healer at let me drop down here david was born for a purpose you have been born for a purpose you've been called by god amen you have been selected by god you have been appointed by god you have been commissioned by god what he was telling david is what he already saw in us he's moving us he's moving the pastor and so you can be able to have that spoken word amen that's what he's coming to but you cannot handle it without character had a man come to my house he's two three times said he was gonna come he didn't he didn't come i went till eight i went to a scale eight on him been around there i felt bad i went and prayed as god was showing me lord he said you still need some more work he might have been wrong but i didn't show him jesus when he came there to the house he said you want to ask me to come in i said hey come on in he said i'm so sorry i'm so i said no i'm sorry i said god use you to show me what was in me he showed me if you don't get in your position and do just what i commissioned you to do that's why you're getting these funny feelings and busted that's why i was sitting there look standing back there looking at you was hitting it right on the money i said okay lord that you i'm doing what you want me to do because that's my business it's seeking souls when i was in that drug world when i was on that heroin when i was out there in the streets when i was struggling i remember a man told me oh pentecostal preacher said boy way to get tired of this life he said call on jesus that's all he told me and until you get tired of being tired and realize that the grace and the mercy that's been extended to you and the condition that the people are in i wish i could show you those pictures we're one of the fastest growing cities in america and you ought to see all those people downtown living in tents on the entrance of charlotte that's why my heart was heavy and that's why god has given me the opportunity to move when you're used to seeing murderers a man know he's facing a life sentence and he's sitting up in bible study and then after that bible study and when you get there and you may see him in another institution and you're in that room having bible study and the man faces 25 years and he come knocking on your door and other inmates it's tough for a man to cry in jail now and come in and knock on the door he said brother glenn brother glenn he's oh sorry for disturbing your bible study he said they didn't give me about 60 months 60 months crying thanking god seeing them around a man took advantage of his mother-in-law was sitting there in prison came home drunk he was working two jobs she was in the wrong bed he got in and took advantage of it he was locked up facing 20 years i would have never knew why he was in prison and he would come into that bible study and just cry because he didn't want to be that way we don't know the probably god said sometimes it could have been the granddaddy grandmama daddy somebody they're suffering from and he got there and he kept coming and he kept coming and he stayed in that jail for over 18 months and that's the one god was using to bring people into the bible study that's what i think was wesley said wesley said in his age he said you know what remember they called him methodist the method he said his method was to pull away from works and moving to visiting the sick to go into the hospital and going into the prisons that's why i couldn't put it away i don't have time to read it but i brought if god would have gave me grace brother branham said you want to see someone that really got the holy ghost they all always have a burden for lost souls oh this ain't no shout message tonight but it's up to him he said now look he says he know dave we're talking about david's purpose and so so this little boy was born in the world for a purpose you believe that and you know god was with him sure he did because he was able he was a crack shot he was a woodsman and he had a little slingshot out there in a in a old lion he said then a bear one day grabbed the little sheep and and started out with it and david took his slingshot he said well you got my daddy on drugs ah i'm coming to get him you got my wife prostituted i'm coming to get him you got my child on alcohol i'm coming to get him huh you got him stealing i'm coming to get him you got no more nicotine i'm coming to get him david said you run it's like bear you're lying you touch one of god i'm coming to get them [Applause] look at david watch it look what david did that's what david did my god my god look what david did he said david took his knife and lying down and took the sheep out of his mouth and when the lion rose up come to himself and rose up david just caught him by the beard and give his hunting knife to him and that end so he showed god was with him he killed the bear also and he knew god was with him he says and now the next thing he did he put he cast out devils if that ain't a spirit-filled man i never seen one he might be little and ready but he was a spirit-filled man god was with him look what he did let's just jump over here to the over here with your life i'm finishing then we'll stop he said look i didn't if i've got now see why he gave me all this but that's not what he wanted me to say like i said glorifying him the last two days i got two hours sleep looking for god and it was something because when the brothers come one o'clock in the morning he said oh brother you up i said yeah i'm up he said you want to talk and after we got finished talking it was about 3 30. he said now i got my message for them all and i'm still wondering what he wants me to say that's why you pray for the pastor it's a labor no man can't move like this trust me look what he said oh david he said david he said they come to the file the armies of the what kind of god the living god a living god and i'm i'm not god but i'll share this with you guys come back to me don't start murmuring and complaining about the time that your pastor's spending up there because i've seen so many of this live streaming and they had an opportunity to come back into the house of the lord and they're so bound up they're not praising the lord they're not giving them thanks they're not giving them his glory because they sat there and got comfortable that laodicea's spirit people's rights everybody got a right but he didn't put that spirit on his bride he gave us the power and the words not only just to go share the gospel but we got right to grant someone eternal life look how much god loves you look how much he's trusted you with look how much he's given us david said you uncircumcised philistine you come and try to defile the army of the living god what i was going to share with you i'll just because i won't read it goliath come and gonna try to boast to david a demon you got right to drive that demon force back who would david say that's why i said what he said goliath means exile you know what exile goliath means exile look what he says he said exile god help man i got it there exile a person expelled by from his country or home by authority david said you uncircumcised philistine yeah you come to try to build the file that means the ranks you come to find the ranks the order the order of the living god this is a divine order you look at no devil but you get around in there they got to discern that you know who you are and where you stand no devil this is the hour that god has given us the authority he's given us the right to drive he did not want to destroy them goliaths told boasting words any y'all that can work me out ah then we serve you david said you are circumcised philistine i remember when god anointed cover fell upon me and god delivered me from that bear and from that lion is that right when they try to grab god's sheep but if your children is out there struggling you got right to claim your children god has given you the authority this is the order of god uh my word abide in you and you abide in me whatever you ask you can receive [Applause] we have the authority god has given to us come on uh musicians you can come forward you we given us the authority we speak not the describes or the pharisees we speak like one with authority is that right our god is almighty god our god is a great god our god comes in the time of trouble when an enemy come in like a flood he lifts up a mighty standard against it you're talking about right now god said the harvest is plenty and the laborers is true turn to matthew footage come to me turn to matthew 4. in 18 i think it's 18 you look at matthew 4 and 18 he says and jesus walked by the sea of galilee saw two brothers simon peter and andrew his brother casting a net into the sea he says for they were what he said unto them follow me and i were what that's the first message he preached to that's why the prophet of god said earnestly contending for the faith i'm going to teach you how to win souls i'm going to teach you how to go out there and use this authority that god has given us the problems [Music] you got to keep that burden for lost souls that's what it's all about go good brother abel john brother hallelujah heads bow
