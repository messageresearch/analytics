[1:12] living completely
[1:13] because you need to enter into another
[1:16] priesthood
[1:22] judah not only have the staff or the
[1:24] deceptor
[1:26] but judah also has a signal or a ceiling
[1:29] ring
[1:30] and judah also have the bracelet and the
[1:33] last thing will be
[1:34] roof who was never pregnant just like
[1:37] demo
[1:37] never pregnant even though married
[1:40] before but in the land of judah
[1:42] there is a boy that you're gonna get
[1:44] there or your pregnancy
[1:46] is guaranteed over there so we dealt
[1:49] with the two bread we explained it
[1:50] already
[1:51] we dealt with the scepter we explained
[1:53] it already
[1:54] and we dealt with the priesthood we also
[1:57] explained it already
[1:59] so today we're going to deal with the
[2:01] ring or
[2:02] the signet of judah everybody clear
[2:06] now to begin with signal what is going
[2:09] on
[2:09] in the land of judah with a signet
[2:12] take genesis chapter 49
[2:16] this is our part six
[2:20] amen we're going to leave the airport
[2:24] sooner
[2:28] genesis chapter 49
[2:30] [Music]
[2:34] verse 8 if you dare you can say amen
[2:40] praise the name of the lord
[2:43] verse 8 judah
[2:47] you are he whom your brethren shall
[2:50] praise
[2:51] your hand shall be in the neck
[2:55] of your enemy the hand of judah
[3:00] is in the neck of his enemy
[3:07] what does he mean
[3:10] what does he mean so when you see judah
[3:13] he's like this
[3:16] are you there his hand his work
[3:20] is holding the enemy's neck
[3:24] your father's children shall bow down
[3:27] before you
[3:29] just like joseph they have to bow down
[3:31] before him
[3:33] remember in the land of egypt and also
[3:36] his brother
[3:37] which was showing that joseph will reach
[3:40] a position of
[3:41] leadership are you there and judah also
[3:45] have to reach a position of what
[3:47] leadership that's why his brother
[3:49] have to bow down remember the dream of
[3:52] joseph
[3:53] verse 9 judah is a lion whelps
[3:57] we know that because the lion of the
[3:59] tribe of judah himself
[4:00] is the lord jesus christ from the prey
[4:04] my son
[4:05] you are gone up he stooped down
[4:08] he catches as a lion and as an old lion
[4:12] who shall rise him up which is a
[4:14] terrible trouble
[4:16] verse 10 the scepter which we already
[4:18] explained
[4:19] shall never depart from judah nor a what
[4:24] so in judah not only is there a
[4:28] scepter but judah is
[4:31] a law giver
[4:34] judah is somebody who makes law
[4:38] it's somebody who enacts law or
[4:42] makes rule if you want to know the law
[4:45] that will
[4:46] bring the jurisdiction of israel those
[4:49] laws must come out of judah everybody
[4:53] there
[4:53] is somebody who is there who draws up
[4:57] and enough to launch for you he's the
[5:00] one that gives you laws
[5:02] he's a lawgiver everybody clear from
[5:05] between his feet
[5:07] until shallow come and to him
[5:10] shall the gathering of the people be in
[5:13] other words judah will continue to
[5:15] operate
[5:16] until shallow which is cross come once
[5:19] christ come
[5:20] the priesthood move from delivering the
[5:23] levitical priesthood
[5:25] and it's transferred into the
[5:27] melchizedek
[5:28] now all the jurisdiction of judah is not
[5:31] all the jurisdiction of israel is no
[5:34] more in judah
[5:35] but now it is in christ because shallow
[5:38] came
[5:39] we move on with shallow because the
[5:41] gathering now
[5:42] should be into christ everybody clear
[5:46] but the key here is judah is a law giver
[5:50] he's somebody who writes law he's
[5:53] somebody
[5:54] who he knocks law everybody clear
[5:57] let's go to second samuel chapter 22
[6:02] praise the name of the lord we found out
[6:04] that his
[6:05] hand is in the neck of his enemy
[6:09] everybody there second samuel chapter 22
[6:14] verse one now if you dare you can say
[6:18] amen
[6:20] and david spoke to the lord who spoke to
[6:23] the lord
[6:25] from which tribe came david everybody
[6:28] clear
[6:29] a first king from judah was devin
[6:32] perfect will of god and david spoke to
[6:36] the lord
[6:38] the word of this song in the day that
[6:40] the lord has done what
[6:42] deliver him out of the hand of what
[6:46] all his enemy and out of the hand of who
[6:49] saul was his brother so god will deliver
[6:54] you not only for your enemy outside
[6:57] even the enemy within the message
[7:01] those that are so-called brother but
[7:04] they're after you
[7:06] are you there the other ecclesiastical
[7:08] power
[7:09] that is within the church the religious
[7:12] power
[7:13] now drop down to verse 38.
[7:18] david is singing he said i have pursued
[7:21] my enemies
[7:22] and did what he's from the land of juba
[7:26] judah and turn not again until i have
[7:30] done what
[7:31] consumed them and i have consumed them
[7:34] and wounded them that they could not
[7:36] erase
[7:38] yeah they are falling under mine
[7:41] remember every single power will be
[7:44] under there
[7:45] praise the name of the lord judah verse
[7:48] 40.
[7:48] for you have guided me with what
[7:51] so god is the one providing strength to
[7:54] battle
[7:55] for david he said them that rolls up
[7:59] against me
[8:00] you have done what so you never
[8:03] make a mistake to attack a jew
[8:07] once you purpose in your heart to attack
[8:10] a jew
[8:10] automatically you are beyond you are
[8:12] under his feet
[8:14] and the spiritual jew we found out was
[8:16] the bread
[8:17] so once you stop messing around with the
[8:19] children of god
[8:21] just know automatically you are doomed
[8:23] for failure
[8:26] amen verse 41
[8:29] you have also given me what
[8:33] did you see that you didn't see that the
[8:36] neck of my enemies why do you have to
[8:40] have the lack of your enemies
[8:42] because judah is always his hand is in
[8:45] the neck
[8:46] of his enemy why do you have to have the
[8:48] neck of your enemy
[8:50] he said you have also given me the neck
[8:53] of my enemies
[8:54] that i met what destroyed them that do
[8:58] what
[8:59] so if you notice here there are two kind
[9:02] of
[9:02] enemies they are one that are pure
[9:05] enemies
[9:07] and there are others that just hate you
[9:10] without any cause
[9:12] but god gives you the neck
[9:15] in other words if somebody hurts you
[9:18] don't worry about it
[9:19] he's already powerless if somebody
[9:22] declared himself to be your enemy
[9:25] go even worry about him once you are
[9:27] standing between him
[9:29] they are already powerless
[9:33] the benefit of the land of judah
[9:36] everybody clear so far praise the name
[9:39] of the lord tap psalm
[9:40] verse 60 hallelujah
[9:44] the battle is not yours because david
[9:46] explained to us where his strength comes
[9:48] from
[9:49] he said my strength coming from the lord
[9:52] so once you are troubled with the
[9:55] children of god
[9:56] don't worry my brother you're gonna get
[9:58] it somehow
[9:59] amen psalm chapter 60
[10:02] verse 7. if you there you can say man
[10:06] gillard is man and manasseh is man
[10:10] ephraim also is the strength of my head
[10:13] judah is my work everybody clear so far
[10:17] so we found out that judah is declared
[10:20] by god
[10:21] as being the law giver
[10:24] so if there is any law that have to come
[10:27] out to
[10:28] judge israel judah will be the one
[10:31] riding the laws
[10:33] everybody clear but what is wrong with
[10:36] that law
[10:37] brother branham now the seal
[10:40] is a sign of a what a finish work
[10:44] and we know that a seal like you are
[10:47] going to steal a box car
[10:50] well they put all the work in it
[10:53] and store everything up and then it is
[10:56] still
[10:57] till its destination any seal
[11:00] is a finnish word when you do what
[11:05] so when judah have to write the document
[11:09] when judah have to write the law
[11:12] he cannot stop only at the riding of the
[11:16] law
[11:19] when you write a document then it is
[11:22] what
[11:23] still at the end never seal
[11:26] until it is what so as the law giver
[11:31] you must have not only writing or the
[11:35] law
[11:35] written but that law must be coupled
[11:39] by a signet in order to certify
[11:43] in order to enforce in order to
[11:46] put into action the law that has been
[11:49] given
[11:51] are we following now if you look
[11:54] at our picture here of the signet
[11:57] when i blow this picture up you found
[12:00] out that there is two things
[12:02] in the picture we have the writing
[12:05] that is the law that is given and we
[12:08] also have
[12:09] a signet which is like a ring
[12:12] are you there and once the law is
[12:15] written
[12:16] once the document is written it is
[12:19] finished
[12:19] then it is completely sealed it is
[12:23] put into action and once they put the
[12:26] seal
[12:26] it means it is finished in other words
[12:30] we cannot come back and temper with that
[12:36] document
[12:38] everybody clear and if you notice the
[12:41] seal
[12:42] is on the right hand side
[12:46] hallelujah brother branham help us again
[12:51] now
[12:52] those two great things now we are going
[12:55] to start first upon the seal of god
[12:58] now what is a seal i love brother
[13:01] brother
[13:02] the first place a cell in the bible
[13:06] now we back in the bible back in the
[13:09] days
[13:10] before people had educated
[13:14] like they are now they usually
[13:17] their sin was there so when judah
[13:21] writes a document at the end of the
[13:24] document
[13:26] how they say president trump you take
[13:29] the seal
[13:30] and struck them everybody
[13:34] just like we used today our just like
[13:37] you said the name
[13:39] sometimes the romans and on back in
[13:43] jewish and way back in the early eastern
[13:47] countries
[13:48] holiday palestine and thing they have uh
[13:52] they have a ring a signal that they had
[13:55] their
[13:56] seal and stamp it on something
[14:00] so that wing that judah have or that
[14:03] signal
[14:04] on top of that ring there was an
[14:07] engraving
[14:08] and that engraving was the seal so
[14:12] whenever a deal is made somehow
[14:14] or a law is given the king always
[14:18] take the seal and step on it as his
[14:21] signature everybody here
[14:24] praise the name of the lord if they
[14:27] could not send their name
[14:29] dacio a seal was a bona fide
[14:33] statement in other words a genuine
[14:37] statement an authentic statement
[14:40] everybody clear original statement
[14:44] original title deed
[14:48] that is what that is
[14:51] was sealed by this seal to try to copy
[14:56] this
[14:56] was a capital fine just like he would be
[15:00] now
[15:00] to try to forge a check somebody's name
[15:03] on a check
[15:04] it was a great fun to try to copy this
[15:07] seal in other words you don't tamper
[15:08] with it
[15:10] and usually the man wore it
[15:13] had his seal worried on his back
[15:16] of his waist here oil
[15:20] either on his wing
[15:23] and he would seal it instead of signing
[15:26] his
[15:27] name everybody clear praise the name of
[15:30] the lord
[15:31] and there come a day then
[15:34] if a son continues on
[15:38] there come a day to what they call the
[15:41] blessing of
[15:42] her son so brother brother now
[15:45] is dealing with adoption everybody clear
[15:49] position placing then the father called
[15:52] a group of people together in the city
[15:54] he took his own son and dressed him in a
[15:57] lovely robe
[15:59] and set him high so everybody could see
[16:02] him
[16:02] had a ceremony and he adopted
[16:07] his own son that had been born
[16:10] into his home there is a difference
[16:14] between the breath
[16:16] and adoption when you are born
[16:19] in christ when you are born
[16:22] into the family that is called the new
[16:26] breath
[16:26] but you are still a child there are
[16:29] certain things
[16:30] god cannot put in your hand because you
[16:33] are not
[16:34] mature yet but you want to go through
[16:37] the training
[16:38] of tutor and administrator and at the
[16:42] end of the training
[16:43] when you are mature when god evaluates
[16:46] you
[16:47] then you're going to be adopted so
[16:50] adopted adoption in the bible
[16:54] is not like the word adoption
[16:57] sound to us usually when we say adoption
[17:01] we are talking about a child that is not
[17:04] yours
[17:05] and you take that child and you get him
[17:07] to your family
[17:08] that is not with the bible with the
[17:11] bible first you must be
[17:12] born into the family and after you are
[17:16] born
[17:16] then you are guaranteed to be adopted
[17:20] everybody clear so the blessing of the
[17:23] ring
[17:24] is not at your best
[17:28] the ring is given after you
[17:32] are adopted he adopted his own son
[17:36] i had been born into his home or bless
[17:39] him
[17:40] and when he did that son's name
[17:44] after that was just as good as the
[17:48] father's
[17:49] name in other words the authority of the
[17:52] father
[17:53] has been transferred into the sun
[17:56] everybody clear no problem on the check
[18:00] or whatever his signature the seal
[18:03] them this was a a ring
[18:07] because many of them could not write
[18:10] it was penitentiary offense to copy that
[18:14] seal
[18:15] the head on the back of the ring and
[18:18] they will mush it like that
[18:20] and he could wear his father's hand why
[18:24] his name was just as good as his
[18:27] father's world as the fathers was
[18:30] now that is what god
[18:33] is trying to get his church to
[18:37] to a place that when we are
[18:40] sons and daughters of god
[18:44] by birth potentially you are
[18:47] already a son of god are you there
[18:50] but for you to receive the full power of
[18:54] god
[18:54] that happened by adoption
[18:58] and brother branham say your behavior
[19:01] determine your adoption
[19:06] hallelujah blessed be the name of the
[19:08] lord
[19:10] now in the old testament when a son was
[19:14] adopted
[19:15] or placed into the family his name
[19:18] was just as good on a check as his
[19:20] daddy's was
[19:22] they had a ring them days a sun
[19:26] signal speed on it blessed
[19:29] there was a signal he wore his daddy's
[19:32] ring
[19:33] his signal and that was just as good
[19:36] as his daddy remember daddy remains
[19:40] daddy the difference between you and
[19:42] that is only the throne
[19:47] you okay now you start dropping praise
[19:50] the name of the lord
[19:52] when the people see you they see christ
[19:55] [Applause]
[19:56] are you there
[20:00] but trust is different than you only by
[20:03] the throne
[20:07] when jesus has been obedient jesus to
[20:11] god
[20:12] god bless him positionally this is him
[20:15] and when the member is born by the holy
[20:18] ghost into the family of god
[20:20] and has proven to have this virtue in
[20:23] him
[20:24] that god sees his virtue knowledge
[20:27] temperance precious brotherly kindness
[20:31] godliness in him in other words you are
[20:34] growing
[20:35] in the stature of a perfect man
[20:38] are you there praise the name of the
[20:40] lord then god
[20:42] seal him that ceiling is not the best
[20:47] are you there that's ceiling when you
[20:50] are born

[20:55] but as you go to the pyramid when you
[20:58] get here
[20:59] there is another ceiling here this
[21:02] ceiling
[21:03] is not your birth but it's a ceiling of
[21:06] adoption are you there
[21:10] now when you listen to the sermon the
[21:12] statute of a perfect man
[21:14] when brother random said the it's like
[21:16] you get the holy ghost on top of it
[21:18] you are born first and brother branham
[21:21] said when you are born
[21:22] you don't manufacture those virtues
[21:25] they are automatically birthing you
[21:28] afterwards
[21:30] you don't lie anymore after a while
[21:33] you don't cheat anymore after a while
[21:35] the cigarette is gone
[21:37] after a while that temper is gone after

[26:11] because once the lord comes then the
[26:14] transfer goes to shadow
[26:19] are you there judah was only a tap
[26:22] but the true love giver is the lord
[26:26] himself
[26:29] hallelujah the lord is your lord given
[26:33] the lord is ours i thought the king will
[26:36] come from judah
[26:38] and that's why god have to come from
[26:40] judah himself
[26:41] but when he come from judah that is
[26:44] shallow
[26:45] the power goes too shallow
[26:48] hallelujah the lord is our king he will
[26:50] do out
[26:52] praise the name of the lord text james
[26:54] chapter 4
[26:56] blessed be the name of the lord

[27:08] oh praise the name of the lord
[27:13] james chapter 4 if you dare you can say
[27:16] amen
[27:18] chapter 4 verse 12.
[27:25] are you there there is what
[27:31] who is that lord given
[27:34] there is one lawgiver who is able to
[27:38] and to do what so the power of salvation
[27:43] and the power of destruction lies
[27:46] with the lord given
[27:50] the lord giver can speak life
[27:55] or he can speak death
[27:57] [Music]
[27:58] a lot of fish can be dying
[28:03] and you can speak life
[28:05] [Applause]
[28:10] hallelujah who are you
[28:14] that judges another so now
[28:18] we found out that the true lord given
[28:21] is the lord jesus christ right
[28:24] he is our king praise the name of the
[28:27] lord
[28:28] if god is the lord giver
[28:32] judah had a signet then god must have a
[28:35] signet
[28:39] take jeremiah 22.
[28:43] we are dealing now with shallow
[28:47] hallelujah jeremiah chapter 22
[28:52] judah had a signal judah was a lawgiver
[28:57] judah was the one that was writing the
[28:59] law when he finished writing the law
[29:01] he put his seal on it and god is our
[29:05] lawgiver
[29:06] and god also writes laws he gave the ten
[29:10] commandments
[29:11] the bible says the ten commandments were
[29:13] written with the
[29:15] singer of god are you there
[29:18] but does he hear the signal jeremiah 22
[29:22] 24 if you dare you can say amen
[29:28] as i live say who the lord
[29:31] darconia the son of jehoiakim
[29:35] king of what this king was wicked
[29:40] where what upon my
[29:44] you remember i showed you a picture
[29:46] where the sickness was where
[29:49] are you there cornell did something that
[29:51] was bad
[29:53] and god have to destroy him and god is
[29:56] saying here
[29:57] even if conair reach a position
[30:02] to be a ring
[30:05] on my right hand
[30:08] you follow me a signet on my
[30:12] right hand yet will i plug you from
[30:14] there
[30:15] god has a position of the ring
[30:20] and that position is in the right hand
[30:23] and god is revealing here that even
[30:26] though connie reached the level to be
[30:30] a signet on my right hand
[30:33] are you there i will plug him off
[30:35] because of what he did
[30:37] so there is a position of a signal
[30:41] that lies in the right hand of god
[30:45] we clear where is that position
[30:50] where is that position before i jump to
[30:54] that position
[30:55] let's understand something you ready
[30:58] all right now in this little portion of
[31:01] the scripture that i have
[31:03] under consideration for text it is such
[31:06] a little tiny thing
[31:07] five little words but what makes it what
[31:11] it is
[31:11] is because it is the scripture the
[31:14] evaluation of the word
[31:16] the word is so valuable no matter if
[31:20] it's one little word
[31:22] it is the value of the word
[31:26] the word was in the beginning as a
[31:30] a thought of god because a word
[31:33] is a thought that is expressed
[31:36] you follow me all right and then it
[31:39] become
[31:40] after thought a word is the thought
[31:42] expressed
[31:44] and when god thinks or anything
[31:47] you ready then when he expresses his
[31:51] thought
[31:52] when god speaks it becomes
[31:57] a sign document
[32:00] [Music]
[32:03] are you following me so the spoken word
[32:07] when it's released it is a document
[32:11] that has been sealed
[32:14] are you there that's why when god says
[32:17] let there
[32:18] be it has to happen
[32:22] because it was a declaration that was
[32:24] written
[32:25] and still once it's released it is
[32:28] finished
[32:30] everybody clear he said i thought
[32:35] when he expresses his thoughts he become
[32:38] huh
[32:40] and everything that god is worth
[32:45] the value of god and everything that god
[32:48] is is behind that word
[32:53] so the spoken word have the
[32:56] value of god
[33:00] and the very essence of god
[33:04] and the spoken word which is the
[33:07] original seed
[33:08] is a sun document
[33:14] where is the name of the lord you say
[33:17] brother stephen god is riding
[33:20] by speaking

[35:27] is concerning my king he concerned god
[35:32] i have the word of god babbling
[35:35] in my heart i have a thought of god
[35:39] that i have been put in my heart and

[36:01] [Music]
[36:02] everybody clear brother branham said
[36:05] when god
[36:06] speak it is a document
[36:09] that has been written on son
[36:13] and david said that the tongue
[36:16] is a pen
[36:20] are you there that's why brother branham
[36:23] said
[36:23] when god said let there be let there be
[36:27] let there be brother madam said god was
[36:31] riding his first bubble he was
[36:34] rubbing the bible with a tongue
[36:38] but out of the abundance of the
[36:42] the word
[36:47] are we together
[36:50] how is god running
[36:53] second peter chapter one
[36:57] we almost gonna get straight in the air
[37:02] are you there praise the name of the
[37:05] lord
[37:06] ii peter chapter 1
[37:09] verse 20 hallelujah
[37:15] you want to create you need to know how
[37:17] we work
[37:20] it's in the message second peter chapter
[37:24] one
[37:25] you there verse 20
[37:30] knowing this first that no
[37:33] prophecy of the scripture
[37:36] is of any private interpretation
[37:40] why verse 21 why you don't interpret you
[37:43] don't play with scripture
[37:45] why verse 21 for the prophecy
[37:49] not in no time
[37:52] by the way of i showed you
[37:56] before that death it was a prophet
[38:00] you remember it's in the scripture i
[38:02] showed you the scripture
[38:04] so now peter is explaining you don't
[38:07] temper with the word
[38:08] because the word that the prophet speak
[38:12] actually it is not the prophet word
[38:17] are you there it didn't come by the will
[38:20] of man
[38:22] in other words in the head of david
[38:25] there is a brain the brain also thinks
[38:30] but this word is not coming from the
[38:33] brain
[38:34] it is coming from the heart
[38:37] you follow me okay he says
[38:41] for the prophecy came not in no time
[38:44] by the will of men but holy men
[38:48] prophets of god spoke
[38:52] as they were moved by god so when a
[38:55] prophet speaks something
[38:58] and something happened it is not
[39:01] the prophet
[39:05] it is god taking his thought
[39:08] putting into the prophet and when the
[39:12] prophets
[39:13] it is a sign document
[39:16] just as god himself talking
[39:20] [Applause]
[39:24] are you there when we say brother
[39:27] branham create
[39:28] the square it is not brother branham
[39:32] it is god amen
[39:39] my god praise the name of the lord
[39:43] the bible is a different book from
[39:46] any other sacred book there is no book
[39:49] like the bible
[39:50] because the bible is god in word form
[39:54] it's a word a word is a thought express
[39:58] god thinking thinking expressing
[40:02] his word to the god in sandra
[40:05] times and diverse mother speak to her
[40:08] father by there
[40:10] but in this last day by his by
[40:13] shallow
[40:15] [Music]
[40:17] are you there amen then they want
[40:20] the bible which is in one form
[40:24] so god take a thought instead of god
[40:27] speaking
[40:28] god took the thought and dropping a
[40:30] prophet
[40:31] and the prophet begin to bubble and the
[40:34] prophets speak
[40:36] and the squad take that and he write it
[40:39] down
[40:40] it is not the word of the squad it is
[40:43] not the word of the prophet
[40:44] it is the word of god
[40:47] [Music]
[40:48] that's why the message is a word
[40:52] of god
[40:54] [Applause]
[40:56] [Music]
[40:59] oh my god and jesus call it
[41:02] ah spoken word
[41:05] and as any seed will bring forth of
[41:08] it in other words when god speak
[41:12] cars don't expect nothing else by the
[41:15] car
[41:18] when god speak elephant elephant will
[41:21] come
[41:22] because the seed spoken have a potential
[41:26] and that potential will reproduce
[41:29] according to the original
[41:31] thought of god
[41:34] hallelujah bring forth the tonkan
[41:38] in the right condition the right
[41:41] atmosphere this book the bible
[41:44] this book of prophecy is telling future
[41:48] event now the book contained the entire
[41:52] revelation of jesus christ praise the
[41:55] name of the lord
[41:57] hebrew 1 1 i just spoke god in sandra
[42:00] times
[42:01] right there so when the prophet was
[42:04] speaking
[42:05] they were you okay now
[42:10] okay that's why brother branham said the
[42:12] bible is god in
[42:14] printed form are in the prophet he was a
[42:18] living god
[42:22] wrote the bible by his own chosen way
[42:26] he never wrote it by theologian neither
[42:29] does he interpret by theologian
[42:31] he never was the time that theologian
[42:34] there never was a time that theologian
[42:36] even had an interpretation of the word
[42:40] of god
[42:42] the interpretation comes only by
[42:46] because that's the pain god is using it
[42:52] [Applause]
[42:54] and the only way we are going to
[42:58] ever we are ever going to gather this
[43:01] mess
[43:03] it is for god to send us down
[43:08] you want to get out of the mess you need
[43:11] the message
[43:13] [Applause]
[43:18] just exactly the only way it's going to
[43:21] be done
[43:22] it's been belief watch and fulfillment
[43:26] it was not wrought by man but it was
[43:29] wrought by who
[43:31] thank you it's not a man's book
[43:34] it's not a theologian book it's a book
[43:38] of who
[43:39] which is a book of what prophecy wrote
[43:43] by god
[43:45] by the prophet and interpreted by them
[43:49] it is written by prophet interpret by
[43:52] prophet
[43:57] the bible says the word of the lord
[43:59] comes to the
[44:01] exactly so
[44:04] god is a love giver
[44:08] god has a signet the signature

[44:23] was already showing
[44:25] that a man can reach a position
[44:29] to become a signal of god
[44:35] do you want me to repeat it over
[44:38] brother bro the bible says that if
[44:41] conair

[44:46] the right hand of god means the power
[44:49] the authority even if konaya

[44:56] meaning when connie speak
[45:00] it's like god speaking are you there

[54:59] and my servant shall be healed for i am
[55:02] a man under what
[55:04] the power of the spoken word is
[55:08] always connected with authority
[55:12] i am a man of authority having soldier
[55:15] under me
[55:16] and i say to this man go and he goes
[55:20] and to another come and he comes
[55:23] he doesn't have to write and say you
[55:26] come here
[55:27] give him ah when he's picked
[55:30] it is a sun document
[55:34] and he has to be executed
[55:37] according to what is on the paper
[55:41] are you there come and to my servant do
[55:44] this
[55:45] and he does it when jesus heard him
[55:49] he marveled jesus said my my my
[55:52] my my my my
[55:53] [Laughter]
[55:55] are you there jesus loved him
[55:59] he looked at the jews he said my my my
[56:02] my my my
[56:03] where is the species hallelujah
[56:07] and say to them that follow all the jews
[56:11] verily i say to you i have not found
[56:16] so what great what
[56:19] so that was god speaking to god
[56:24] because that faith doesn't come by
[56:27] intellect
[56:28] it was god talking to god
[56:33] but the god of the gentiles is
[56:36] higher
[56:41] hallelujah finally i say to you i have
[56:44] not found so great
[56:46] faith no not in what in other words when
[56:49] jesus said
[56:50] my my mind he stopped he checked israel
[56:54] under the loop zero he said in israel
[56:58] nothing but this faith comes from her
[57:02] and i sent to you
[57:05] that many shall come from there
[57:10] and for and shall sit down
[57:14] with who and isaac and
[57:17] and the in the kingdom of heaven
[57:20] but the children of the kingdom shall be
[57:24] cast
[57:24] out into other darkness there shall be
[57:27] what
[57:29] and nothing of what in other words the
[57:31] jews will be out
[57:33] but by what you are saying the power
[57:37] of the spoken word there is a
[57:40] people down the road that will come
[57:44] that i'm gonna deal with them according
[57:47] to what you just done
[57:48] right now those people will sit with
[57:52] abraham with isaac with jacob
[57:55] while the jews are going under
[57:58] tribulation period
[58:03] make sense because that's why brother
[58:06] branham said
[58:07] when the rapture comes the old testament
[58:10] sin will be in front of us
[58:12] because we must sit with isaac with
[58:15] jacob
[58:16] with abraham while they are they are in
[58:20] tribulation period are we following
[58:24] now that we understand zero baby
[58:28] must be the signal the power
[58:31] would transfer to the robot
[58:35] all right let's deal with this then we
[58:38] begin to sew straight i'm going to
[58:42] introduce
[58:43] this vision of brother brandon
[58:47] what i'm saying and it said i
[58:50] started looking up in the rock there was
[58:53] a brother that came to brother branham
[58:55] he came with a dream and when we came
[58:58] here for jim he said brother one of my
[58:59] had a dream
[59:01] i saw a big mountain
[59:04] and i start looking up the rock like
[59:07] this
[59:08] and look on in past the cloud
[59:12] so the mountain was so high until it
[59:16] reached
[59:16] past the cloud and the man could see
[59:19] past the cloud he said and way up there
[59:23] standing on the rock that reached from
[59:26] east to west
[59:28] a big rock reaching from the east to
[59:30] west east and west
[59:32] meet the gospel started from the east
[59:35] was going
[59:36] to the west but once he hit west there's
[59:39] like
[59:40] something going on there east and west

[1:10:39] when israel looked at moses the face of

[1:10:59] [Applause]
[1:11:02] are you there are you there well
[1:11:05] snow white like man transfiguration
[1:11:09] like jesus and adoption have taken place
[1:11:14] an authority has been given
[1:11:18] are you there the signal was there
[1:11:23] because the sword of the king struck his
[1:11:26] end
[1:11:30] you were standing there and you spoke
[1:11:34] with what
[1:11:36] there was no guessing to it no more joke
[1:11:39] every man
[1:11:41] understood exactly what you said
[1:11:44] because adoption was pressed
[1:11:48] the signet was transferred
[1:11:56] now let's land straight to the airport
[1:12:00] remember when we talk about the scepter
[1:12:03] we to understand the scepter we went to
[1:12:06] the book of esther
[1:12:09] now we are dealing with the segment so
[1:12:12] to understand more this segment
[1:12:14] let's go back to western
[1:12:19] in the book of esther there is a young
[1:12:22] lady by the name of esther
[1:12:25] and that young lady has a cousin by the
[1:12:28] name of mordechai
[1:12:30] take esther chapter 2 then we are
[1:12:32] heading this way
[1:12:37] take a step then we're heading this way
[1:12:39] esther comes after nehemiah
[1:12:42] after nehemiah before job
[1:12:46] if you dare you can say amen esther
[1:12:49] chapter 2
[1:12:51] everybody at work
[1:12:55] esther chapter 2
[1:13:00] verse 5. now in
[1:13:04] shushan the palace there was a certain
[1:13:07] what
[1:13:09] a certain what are you aware core
[1:13:12] sales searching is certain
[1:13:15] [Music]
[1:13:17] you know the jew spiritually speaking
[1:13:19] we're dealing with judah
[1:13:21] jew whose name was mordecai
[1:13:25] the son of jail the son of shema
[1:13:28] the son of kichair when the gospel left
[1:13:32] the jews was going through paul
[1:13:34] remember and benjamin was the tribe that
[1:13:38] cling to judah
[1:13:40] and they also took on the name jew
[1:13:46] clear who had been carried away from
[1:13:49] jerusalem
[1:13:50] with the captivity which has been
[1:13:52] carried away by
[1:13:53] with jeconiah you see that
[1:13:56] king of what the captivity was judah
[1:14:00] but it took benjamin also because
[1:14:02] benjamin
[1:14:03] was with judah remember naomi and ruth
[1:14:06] you remember praise the name of the lord
[1:14:09] whom nebuchadnezzar the king of babylon
[1:14:12] had carried away
[1:14:13] and he brought up hadassah that is
[1:14:16] esther
[1:14:17] his uncle daughter
[1:14:21] so esther and mordecai
[1:14:24] were cousins they were family
[1:14:28] [Music]
[1:14:29] they were in the same family
[1:14:32] but mordecai was older
[1:14:36] than esther
[1:14:40] mordecai was mature
[1:14:43] than esther
[1:14:47] okay for she had neither father
[1:14:50] nor mother and the man was fair and
[1:14:53] beautiful
[1:14:54] who mordecai when her father and mother
[1:14:57] were dead
[1:14:58] took for his own what this is two
[1:15:01] cousins
[1:15:02] but one is so older that he take the
[1:15:06] younger cousin
[1:15:07] as his own daughter so there was a big
[1:15:11] gap between mordecai and esther
[1:15:15] monica reached maturity before
[1:15:18] este they were in the same family
[1:15:22] both of them were jews but one had the
[1:15:26] responsibility
[1:15:28] of esther
[1:15:33] everybody here jump to verse 15
[1:15:36] and when the turn of esther the daughter
[1:15:40] of abigail
[1:15:41] the uncle of mordecai who had been
[1:15:43] taking
[1:15:44] her for his daughter was come to go into
[1:15:47] the king
[1:15:48] she required nothing but what hair guide
[1:15:51] the king's chamberlain
[1:15:52] the keeper of the home appointed and as
[1:15:55] they obtained
[1:15:56] favor in the sight of all of them that
[1:15:58] looked upon him
[1:15:59] she stayed with the message she didn't
[1:16:01] take anything there
[1:16:03] so esther was taken
[1:16:06] to king adversaries into the royal house
[1:16:10] royal judah royal house
[1:16:13] in the 10th month which is the month of
[1:16:17] tibet
[1:16:18] in the seventh year of reign so esther
[1:16:22] was taken in the ten months and in the
[1:16:26] seven years
[1:16:28] you see ten and seven there
[1:16:31] are there in the tenth month of the
[1:16:34] seventh year
[1:16:35] in revelation 10 verse 7
[1:16:42] are you there verse 19 and when the
[1:16:46] virgin were gathered together the second
[1:16:48] time then mordecai sat where
[1:16:51] the kings gave so mordecai never
[1:16:55] entered inside the court monica was
[1:16:58] outside the court
[1:16:59] in the king's day not in the inner part
[1:17:02] inner walls whereas they entered and the
[1:17:05] golden scepter was given here
[1:17:07] you remember inside the inner court
[1:17:09] praise the name of the lord verse 20.
[1:17:12] esther has not yet shown his kindred not
[1:17:15] her people
[1:17:16] as mordechai has charged her for esther
[1:17:19] did the commandment of mordecai
[1:17:21] like us when she was brought up with him
[1:17:24] so mordecai told herself not to explain
[1:17:28] who don't tell the people
[1:17:29] that they were jews and they were also
[1:17:32] related
[1:17:33] everybody clear now after these two
[1:17:36] characters
[1:17:37] in the book of esther we have another
[1:17:40] character
[1:17:41] by the name of nemo
[1:17:45] herman in esther chapter 3 if you can
[1:17:48] drop there
[1:17:49] everybody there everybody there
[1:17:52] amen verse 1 after big things
[1:17:57] did being a hazardous promoted heaven
[1:18:00] the son of hamedatta the elder guide
[1:18:04] and advanced him and set his seat above
[1:18:07] all the princes that were with him
[1:18:11] so there is three characters here one is
[1:18:14] [Music]
[1:18:15] mordecai the second one is esther
[1:18:20] but working with esther and mordecai
[1:18:23] there is a man by the name of heaven
[1:18:27] and heaven was a priest
[1:18:31] just like the servant of king of hazarus
[1:18:34] but a man was elevated
[1:18:37] above all the presses
[1:18:41] are you following me jump to verse five

[1:31:33] i will ascend above the height of the
[1:31:35] cloud
[1:31:36] i will be like who are you there
[1:31:40] so the spirit that was walking into
[1:31:43] neman
[1:31:44] was the spirit of lucifer
[1:31:51] brother branham just about the time that
[1:31:54] jesus came on the scene
[1:31:56] judah came on the scene the antichrist
[1:32:00] and the one against christ i want you to
[1:32:02] notice the natures of this spirit now
[1:32:06] judah was a religious man he was not an
[1:32:08] infidel
[1:32:09] and all of us know that he was the
[1:32:12] antichrist
[1:32:13] he worked their very closest hand to
[1:32:16] christ
[1:32:18] the right-hand man of king
[1:32:22] are hercules did you know that
[1:32:26] in heaven that
[1:32:29] heaven the devil was god's
[1:32:32] right hand man
[1:32:37] are you there in the beginning that
[1:32:40] lucifer
[1:32:41] the son of the morning was given what
[1:32:45] god gave them this signet
[1:32:48] [Music]
[1:32:52] hallelujah in his pride
[1:32:55] went over in the north and set up a
[1:32:58] kingdom
[1:32:59] and fought against michael and his angel
[1:33:02] the right-hand man
[1:33:04] of almighty god was who
[1:33:07] heyman the son of the morning the first
[1:33:10] god granted him almost co-worker with
[1:33:14] him
[1:33:15] he was co-worker partly equal with him
[1:33:19] only satan could not what
[1:33:24] everybody clear we begin now to go
[1:33:26] straight this way now
[1:33:28] you know satan was god's right hand man
[1:33:32] you know he knows more about the
[1:33:34] scripture than any theologian in the
[1:33:36] world today
[1:33:38] satan was the original archangel of god
[1:33:42] he was dwelling in the heaven you ready
[1:33:47] he wants the greatest person
[1:33:51] in heaven outside of who
[1:33:54] who was the greatest priest servant
[1:33:58] in the king a hazaris outside of king
[1:34:02] hazaris with here
[1:34:05] he was god's right hand man to
[1:34:08] fellowship
[1:34:09] him and king of jesus and he got
[1:34:12] puffed up in what i believe there is
[1:34:16] nobody
[1:34:16] the king will elevate like everybody
[1:34:19] clear
[1:34:22] a man without character can reign
[1:34:27] because power apart from character is
[1:34:30] what
[1:34:32] he got power but no character
[1:34:36] are you there but power with character
[1:34:40] is referred to what you can be a
[1:34:44] lawgiver
[1:34:46] are you there and since he wants us
[1:34:50] to share even what
[1:34:53] oh my god on the basis that he
[1:34:56] overcame and he sat down in his father's
[1:34:59] throne
[1:35:00] then we have overcome to sit with what
[1:35:04] with him now when you look at mordecai
[1:35:08] that's the spirit that resisted
[1:35:12] heaven
[1:35:15] god i'm now going this way i just did
[1:35:17] this i'm
[1:35:18] going this way i'm i'm turning are you
[1:35:21] there
[1:35:23] and god and the spirit that is joined
[1:35:25] with god
[1:35:26] is one spirit in other words god
[1:35:30] and his children are one
[1:35:34] that's right now the spirit of god that
[1:35:36] dwell in the church
[1:35:38] is the spirit that comes from heaven
[1:35:41] that god
[1:35:42] knew before the foundation of the world
[1:35:45] that rejected the devil's word
[1:35:50] so when you are rejecting the devil's
[1:35:53] lives today
[1:35:55] and you are standing for the message you
[1:35:58] already did it in heaven
[1:36:02] are you there what you are doing now is
[1:36:05] only a replica a fulfillment
[1:36:08] on what you did in heaven
[1:36:14] that spirit had to take a body of flesh
[1:36:18] to take testing that's what we come to
[1:36:20] do he had to come flesh like this other
[1:36:22] did
[1:36:23] all of them put on echo yoke and god by
[1:36:26] the beginning
[1:36:27] know the spirit that would and which
[1:36:30] would not
[1:36:31] there you are that devil is so wise
[1:36:34] he just deceived the very elect if he
[1:36:37] was
[1:36:38] the reason why you won't be deceived
[1:36:40] because
[1:36:41] you fought the game in heaven
[1:36:44] are you there so just like
[1:36:47] spirits resisted lucifer in heaven
[1:36:51] there was a particular spirit
[1:36:54] that resisted heaven
[1:36:57] and that spirit was responsible
[1:37:00] for esther
[1:37:04] everybody there as we look at mordechai
[1:37:09] i'm heading to the airport there is five
[1:37:13] things
[1:37:13] important for mordechai
[1:37:16] if you're sleeping wake up
[1:37:20] one day there was a plot against the
[1:37:23] king
[1:37:25] and mordecai caught the plot
[1:37:28] and mordecai informed the king
[1:37:31] and the king life was spared
[1:37:35] we know that when everybody was bowing
[1:37:38] down to heaven
[1:37:41] mordecai stood up and
[1:37:44] resisted heaven
[1:37:48] we know that later on mordecai
[1:37:51] came and spoke to his wife and his
[1:37:54] wife's name is
[1:37:55] saresh you can look in the book of
[1:37:57] esther
[1:37:58] which means gold babylon
[1:38:01] are you there and his wife told him
[1:38:05] you want to be happy there's nothing you
[1:38:07] have to do go to the king
[1:38:09] and ask him to kill mordechai
[1:38:12] so heaven had the wife
[1:38:16] that gave him permission to go and
[1:38:19] destroy
[1:38:21] mordechai are you there
[1:38:24] then later on we're going to find out
[1:38:27] that
[1:38:29] god the king of hazards
[1:38:32] took the sickness from heaven
[1:38:36] you follow me and give it to mordechai
[1:38:41] and mordecai in this town
[1:38:44] was disclosed to the king over here
[1:38:49] mordecai was still at the king's gate
[1:38:52] outside the palace are you there
[1:38:56] okay but right here mordecai
