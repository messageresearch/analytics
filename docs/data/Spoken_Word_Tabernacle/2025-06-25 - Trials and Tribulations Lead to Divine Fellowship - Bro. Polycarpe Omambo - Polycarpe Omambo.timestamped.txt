[0:00] a doctor about three days ago said, "You
[0:02] got two children. He gave you a female
[0:04] examination. He said you had a cyst on
[0:07] the womb." She looked down, bowed her
[0:10] head, she said, "That is true." And I
[0:13] said, "Now, if you read the New
[0:15] Testament, is that like Jesus Christ who
[0:17] told the woman at the well, that is
[0:20] true." And I said, "Well, why did you
[0:23] come to me as a Christian? Why didn't
[0:25] you go to your Muhammad and prophet?"
[0:27] She said, 'I think you can help me now.
[0:30] I said, 'I can't help you, but if you'll
[0:32] accept this Jesus who is here now, who
[0:34] knows your life and knows all about you,
[0:36] he'll help you. She said, I accept Jesus
[0:39] as my savior. That did it. That was it.

[47:30] especially on the convention.
[47:35] Let me look at the time.
[47:38] Praise God. If I have a place that I
[47:41] need to enjoy more, it's the house of
[47:42] the Lord. Amen. Think about what the
[47:45] devil trying to do to you all day long.

[48:18] [Applause]
[48:18] [Music]
[48:27] Oh, I'm going to let the glory roll in
[48:29] the rolling rolling glory.
[48:32] I'm going to get beside myself when I
[48:34] get beside the king that day. I'm going
[48:38] to have the time of my life when the
[48:39] time of my life is over.
[48:42] I'm going to get carried away when I get
[48:45] there. Oh, I'm going to let the Lord
[48:49] roll over.
[48:52] I'm going to get myself
[48:56] that day. I'm going to have to come on
[48:59] my life when my life is over. I'm going
[49:03] to get carried away when I get carried
[49:05] away.
[49:07] Oh, I don't know why I become a little
[49:10] shy when I get around a whole lot of
[49:12] people. And I can't figure out why I
[49:14] never can shout about the love that
[49:16] floods my soul. Yeah, I must confess. I
[49:19] can't express the feelings deep inside
[49:22] me. For the things I know and cannot
[49:25] show, one day will overflow.
[49:28] I'm going to let the glory roll
[49:31] in glory.
[49:33] I'm going to get myself.
[49:38] I'm going to have the time of my life
[49:40] when my life is over.
[49:43] I'm going to get carried away. When I
[49:45] get carried away,
[49:48] I'll pass the clouds and I'll shout so
[49:50] loud. May song like thunder, my fearful
[49:54] life will fill the sky until it looks
[49:57] like rain. When I leave this world, the
[50:00] gates above stand before my savior. I
[50:03] let my soul let the glory roll from the
[50:06] rolling cold my
[50:10] [Music]
[50:12] glory rolling. the rolling holy glory.
[50:15] Oh, I'm going to get inside myself when
[50:18] I get inside the king that day. I'm
[50:21] going to have the time of my life when
[50:23] my life is over.
[50:26] I'm going to get carried away when I get
[50:28] carried away.
[50:31] Let the glory roll
[50:33] in glory.
[50:35] I'm going to tell when I get the dream.
[50:40] I'm going to have the time of my life
[50:42] when the love of my life is over.
[50:45] I'm going to get carried away when I get
[50:48] carried away.
[50:50] I'm going to get carried away when I get
[50:53] carried away.
[50:58] Amen.
[51:00] Glory to God. So that last demon is
[51:03] already completely gone. So you ready
[51:05] for the word of God? What a blessing. 50
[51:08] years old. Jubilee. God bless your
[51:11] sister D. God bless your sister. 60
[51:13] years old. The Lord is wonderful.
[51:17] Everybody looking still strong and
[51:19] young. Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[51:22] Let's give him a big clap offering
[51:24] again.
[51:26] Amen.
[51:28] It is that quickening power.
[51:31] It's already start working. Amen. The
[51:34] rapture is getting very very very very
[51:37] close and our Adam's body begin to react
[51:41] and synchronize with the coming of the
[51:43] Lord. Amen. If you don't have that
[51:46] experience, get the Holy Ghost inside of
[51:48] you. Then you will begin to see exactly
[51:51] what we're talking about because it's
[51:53] the spirit that is inside that will
[51:55] quicken our mortal body and we will be
[51:58] changed in a twinkling in a moment. Oh
[52:00] my, I can't wait when the Holy Spirit
[52:02] will open up the way so we can dig into
[52:04] this so you know exactly what happened
[52:06] when the rapture comes. It won't be like
[52:09] okay we going to be maybe flying like
[52:11] this and this one may be no no no no no
[52:13] you need to know exactly what's going to
[52:14] happen and brother Brandham even
[52:16] explained how the sweep will come on you
[52:19] so you need to understand and when you
[52:21] begin to feel it you say okay
[52:24] [Laughter]
[52:25] it's time to go amen if you see your
[52:28] loved one coming up you say oh praise be
[52:30] to the name of the Lord I knew you were
[52:33] coming and I knew we ready to go amen I
[52:36] will go court after quote and scripture
[52:39] after scripture and quote after quote.
[52:41] Brother Brandham even tell you how long
[52:43] we will stay here with our loved one.
[52:45] Yes sir. And what is the purpose of us
[52:48] first saying together before we meet
[52:50] Jesus Christ? There is a purpose on that
[52:52] one. Amen. I will read brother Brandham
[52:55] quote after quote after quote. I was
[52:57] about to dive into it and I got a block
[52:59] from the boss. So I have to wait till he
[53:01] open up the way. Amen. But at least on
[53:03] the meanwhile we can glory in our
[53:05] infirmities.
[53:09] Did you review the sermon? Amen. So pray
[53:12] for me so on Sunday we can get into that
[53:14] thorn and see what is the turn of Paul.
[53:18] What is he really all about? So now you
[53:20] will minimize everything, every dart
[53:22] that the devil is throwing towards you,
[53:24] you will understand that the more he
[53:26] throws, the better you become. Amen.
[53:29] Because everything he's throwing
[53:31] actually it's truly a blessing. I know
[53:34] it hurts but it's a blessing. But you
[53:36] will see what Paul does. Because
[53:37] remember, as long as that guy is there,
[53:40] then the power of Christ will rest.
[53:44] If you take that guy out,
[53:47] I will show you even in the life of
[53:48] brother Bran and you will see how it
[53:50] goes. Amen. We are most privileged
[53:52] people and anxiety time is over. Amen.
[53:57] It's over. Completely over. God is
[54:01] leading his bride all the way to the
[54:03] last push and before we know it, we'll
[54:05] be out of here. So, we greet you all in
[54:07] the precious name of our Lord and Savior
[54:09] Jesus Christ to both visible and
[54:11] invisible audience. And my brothers
[54:13] here, I shook your hand. I don't know
[54:14] your name, but welcome to Spoken Word
[54:17] Tabernacle. You're not a visitor, you're
[54:18] a family member. Amen.
[54:22] God bless you, my sister in the back.
[54:24] And anybody else that I forgot, God
[54:26] bless you. And welcome to Spoken Word
[54:28] Tabernacle. Here we say amen. We you
[54:30] enjoy the word. So if you want to say
[54:32] amen, don't be shy. But I know if the
[54:34] spirit is in you and he kick you, you
[54:36] will say amen regardless of who is
[54:38] around you. Amen. Glory to God. It's a
[54:41] convention night. So I'm not the one
[54:43] preaching. It's brother Polycarp. It
[54:45] says in a little while he have not
[54:47] preached. So brother Polycarp will be
[54:48] preaching and brother J. Albert will be
[54:52] translating. So by God's grace, God in
[54:55] his time, in his season, according to
[54:58] his purpose, he provided a translator
[55:02] so I can get a break. Amen. Let's go. We
[55:05] finally believe.

[57:26] Yes. Everything is possible to those
[57:28] that believe this evening.
[57:31] It doesn't matter the situation.
[57:32] Everything is possible.
[57:34] Thank you.
[57:36] May God bless you richly.
[57:43] I want to thank the pastor
[57:49] for this opportunity that he gave us to
[57:50] come into the house of the Lord
[57:54] to make a little noise for the glory of
[57:56] God. Amen. Amen.
[57:59] [Music]
[58:00] Because we're beings from heavens.
[58:06] May God bless the pastor.
[58:08] his wife and his children and those that
[58:12] belongs to him.
[58:17] We render grace to God for allowing us
[58:19] to come to his presence.
[58:23] I thank you all that are present and
[58:25] those that are online.
[58:31] I believe
[58:33] I believe you will never be dis um I
[58:37] believe you will never be disappointed
[58:38] because you did not come to listen to a
[58:40] man
[58:43] but to listen to God and see God
[58:50] but we can only see God through men.
[58:54] May God bless you richly.
[58:58] [Music]
[59:00] Without taking too long, we can go to
[59:02] the books of Daniel.
[59:06] Daniel chapter 6.
[59:20] I will start from
[59:23] I'll start from Daniel chapter 6 verse
[59:25] 21- 22 and 26
[59:29] over here just to um save time you can
[59:32] read it at home
[59:43] because I believe all of us for reading
[59:45] a chapter in the morning and a chapter
[59:47] in the evening.
[59:51] That's why the servant of the Lord is
[59:53] standing here. Amen.
[59:58] Everything will pass but the word of God
[1:00:00] will never pass.
[1:00:02] I read in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:00:03] Christ.
[1:00:11] Then Daniel Then said Daniel unto the
[1:00:14] king, "Oh king, live forever." Amen.
[1:00:21] My God.
[1:00:23] [Music]
[1:00:25] My God has sent his angel and have shut
[1:00:28] the lion's mouth.
[1:00:40] [Music]
[1:00:42] that they have not hurt me. For as much
[1:00:46] as before him innocence was found in me,
[1:00:51] and also before thee, oh king, have have
[1:00:54] I done nothing? I mean, have I done no
[1:00:57] heart?
[1:00:59] [Music]
[1:01:08] Then was the king exceeding glad for him
[1:01:12] and commanded that they should take
[1:01:14] Daniel up out of the den.
[1:01:23] [Music]
[1:01:26] So Daniel was taken up out of the den
[1:01:29] and no and no manner of hurt was found
[1:01:32] upon him because he believed in his God.
[1:01:38] We'll pray to the Lord.
[1:01:40] Lord, eternal father,
[1:01:43] the creator of heaven and earth,
[1:01:47] the author of the word that we just
[1:01:48] read.
[1:01:51] We're here before you this evening,
[1:01:55] knowing that in the evening time, we
[1:01:57] have food
[1:02:00] that's not like any type of food,
[1:02:03] but a food that comes from.
[1:02:07] And in that meal, everything is found.
[1:02:11] Well, this world is in chaos,
[1:02:16] but we have the solution to all of our
[1:02:20] message in this in your word.
[1:02:23] That's why this evening,
[1:02:27] we come Lord Jesus
[1:02:30] by the promise that you promised us.
[1:02:33] We want to attach ourselves to
[1:02:37] see the evidence of that in our lives.
[1:02:40] There are those that came sick.
[1:02:43] There are those that have problems,
[1:02:47] but they can only find solution in you.
[1:02:52] And there's no man that can bring
[1:02:54] solution.
[1:02:56] But it be you. That's why we call you.
[1:02:59] So you may remove us out of the way
[1:03:02] and that you may take preeminence. May
[1:03:05] you may you speak to your people. May
[1:03:07] you heal the sick.
[1:03:09] We deliver those that are captive.
[1:03:12] May we come to those that are need
[1:03:15] and confirm those those that are trying
[1:03:18] and lift those that are that have
[1:03:20] fallen. Save those that are lost.
[1:03:25] May you manifest yourself this week. We
[1:03:28] thank you for it all
[1:03:31] while leaving you the preeminence
[1:03:33] in the name of Jesus Christ.
[1:03:36] take the control from the pulpit to the
[1:03:38] last row
[1:03:43] and may every door be closed
[1:03:49] that we may listen to you and you alone
[1:03:52] in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen.
[1:03:55] You may be seated.
[1:03:58] May God be worshiped. Amen.
[1:04:03] You will notice where we just came from
[1:04:05] reading a little.
[1:04:10] Daniel the servant of the Lord said
[1:04:16] that God has sent his angel. So he said
[1:04:20] to the king
[1:04:23] to close the mouth of the lion. Amen.
[1:04:26] Amen.
[1:04:30] In what condition did Daniel found
[1:04:32] himself in the lion's den?
[1:04:36] Daniel had not sinned.
[1:04:40] He didn't steal anything from anyone.
[1:04:43] He did not commit any sin.
[1:04:47] And we read that he testified
[1:04:50] that even before God,
[1:04:53] even even before the king and men,
[1:04:57] he had done no wrong.
[1:05:00] But this evening, me and you,
[1:05:04] we can have this same declaration
[1:05:10] that
[1:05:12] we have not done anything against God
[1:05:14] and against man.
[1:05:18] But you see, Daniel found himself in
[1:05:20] trials.
[1:05:23] And during trials,
[1:05:26] that's where he met God.
[1:05:29] That's where he had fellowship with God.
[1:05:33] It wasn't someone else. It was God the
[1:05:36] creator.
[1:05:37] Just like this evening.
[1:05:40] I don't know what type of trials that
[1:05:42] you're going through.
[1:05:45] I don't know what type of tribulation
[1:05:47] that you're going through,
[1:05:49] but this evening your God will tell you
[1:05:53] that trials
[1:05:55] and tribulation
[1:05:59] that produces
[1:06:02] your fellowship with God, a divine
[1:06:04] fellowship. Amen.
[1:06:08] You have to remember that you're God.
[1:06:11] He's called Jehovah Gyra.
[1:06:13] Jehovah Rafa.
[1:06:16] He is the God that has many attributes
[1:06:21] and those attribute cannot operate.
[1:06:26] If you do not find yourself in a trial,
[1:06:30] if you're not going through a
[1:06:32] tribulation,
[1:06:36] it's not because you've done something
[1:06:38] wrong
[1:06:40] that you're going through trials
[1:06:42] or through tribulations,
[1:06:45] but maybe in you
[1:06:48] had missed something.
[1:06:51] Maybe you don't have patience.
[1:06:55] Maybe you don't have uh loyalty. Amen.
[1:06:58] Amen.
[1:07:00] Maybe you're lacking something
[1:07:03] among all the virtue.
[1:07:07] And God occasionally
[1:07:10] may bring a circumstance
[1:07:13] because he wants to see you in his image
[1:07:17] in his likeness.
[1:07:19] He is perfect
[1:07:21] and you also need to be perfect.
[1:07:25] So when you're lacking something,
[1:07:28] he is specialized in every case.
[1:07:32] He can create something
[1:07:36] to bring you closer to him
[1:07:40] to bring you
[1:07:42] to have fellowship with him. Amen. Amen.
[1:07:46] I want to read something
[1:07:50] and be certain of God.
[1:07:57] The prophet of God is saying this in
[1:07:58] paragraph 97.
[1:08:05] [Music]
[1:08:07] Be certain of God of 1959 January 25th.
[1:08:17] If the preachers preaches the word
[1:08:28] And the man that receives it, believes
[1:08:31] it, and acts upon it,
[1:08:37] something has to happen.
[1:08:41] If you're a sinner this evening, Amen.
[1:08:44] Amen.
[1:08:46] You have to be saved.
[1:08:50] If you're sick,
[1:08:53] you have to be healed
[1:08:56] because God promised it.
[1:09:00] If we're certain of God,
[1:09:05] unless if you have something else in
[1:09:07] your spirit,
[1:09:09] but if you're certain of God,
[1:09:12] that he is the one that give the
[1:09:13] promise, he's the one who made the
[1:09:15] promise and he is capable of completing
[1:09:18] his promise. He will do it this evening.
[1:09:23] Your situation will change this evening.
[1:09:25] Amen. Amen.
[1:09:30] I'll read in paragraph 39 he says this
[1:09:35] you know when we have confessed our sins
[1:09:41] and met every requirement that God
[1:09:44] requires.
[1:09:48] We believed on God
[1:09:52] there there is a circumstance
[1:09:55] has to be met.
[1:09:59] and it's according to his will.
[1:10:03] We confessed our sins.
[1:10:07] We made all the wrongs
[1:10:12] that we have done,
[1:10:15] right?
[1:10:19] Done. Everything that we know how to do,
[1:10:25] every requirement that God has made or
[1:10:27] asked, we have met that requirement.
[1:10:33] And yet he lays silent.
[1:10:38] He just won't answer us.
[1:10:42] Listen,
[1:10:45] I'm sure that I'm speaking to people
[1:10:47] this morning for us is this evening.
[1:10:50] Amen. Amen.
[1:10:56] to certain people that are going through
[1:10:58] that.
[1:11:01] [Music]
[1:11:13] Here the prophet is talking that maybe
[1:11:15] one of us are going through a trial that
[1:11:17] maybe you've done something that maybe
[1:11:19] you yourself know.
[1:11:23] [Music]
[1:11:26] and the the prophet is saying if you
[1:11:28] obey to the requirements of God
[1:11:31] and you confess it and you fix it
[1:11:36] there will be nothing that will stop you
[1:11:40] will have your your desire
[1:11:44] if you're sick you will be healed
[1:11:48] amen
[1:11:50] the prophet says is
[1:11:54] maybe you went through something that's
[1:11:56] bad
[1:11:57] or you did it wrong somewhere
[1:12:00] and you're condemning yourself
[1:12:03] the prophet is talking here
[1:12:05] that even he himself
[1:12:08] he found himself that he does something
[1:12:10] wrong
[1:12:12] and when he had done that
[1:12:14] what did he do he would return to God
[1:12:19] let's read the prophet
[1:12:24] He says, "I've been there many times
[1:12:26] myself.
[1:12:30] I've went back and traced my life and
[1:12:33] turn I've went back and traced my life
[1:12:36] [Music]
[1:12:38] and turned over every stone
[1:12:45] and I find that I've did something
[1:12:48] wrong.
[1:12:50] I'd go I'd go confess it
[1:12:54] saying Lord God
[1:12:59] saying Lord God I'll make it right
[1:13:05] and go do so then come back again and
[1:13:08] said now Lord our God you'll answer me
[1:13:16] surely I met every request that you
[1:13:19] required me to do
[1:13:24] and he still won't move.
[1:13:29] He seems to be uh he seems to set
[1:13:32] silence.
[1:13:36] That's when you need to be sure. You
[1:13:39] need to be certain that he is God. You
[1:13:41] don't need to be discouraged.
[1:13:43] Hallelujah.
[1:13:46] The only thing that is
[1:13:49] the only thing that is that in your
[1:13:51] heart to be certain of God in those
[1:13:54] situations. Amen. Amen. Amen.
[1:14:00] Anything that you could do or that you
[1:14:02] have done.
[1:14:04] But if you go back to God based on the
[1:14:07] norms, based on his requirements,
[1:14:12] not based on your own thoughts,
[1:14:15] not based on your own will,
[1:14:19] but based on what is written,
[1:14:22] based on the will of God.
[1:14:25] It is written in the scripture.
[1:14:28] That is the the will of God.
[1:14:31] The message that we're reading
[1:14:34] is the will of God
[1:14:38] and you're fulfilling those
[1:14:39] requirements.
[1:14:41] There will be nothing that God will
[1:14:44] obtain obstain from you this year.
[1:14:49] I'll read a little bit in the beginning
[1:14:51] and ending of the gentile dis
[1:14:52] dispensation
[1:14:55] paragraph 28 of 1955.
[1:14:59] [Music]
[1:15:04] And as I noticed, then God permitted
[1:15:06] Satan to give him the test.
[1:15:11] The trials that you're going through.
[1:15:16] It's the creator, your creator that
[1:15:18] allowed Satan.
[1:15:21] Why did he allow Satan?
[1:15:24] Like I just came from saying a few
[1:15:26] moments ago,
[1:15:29] maybe in you there's no loyalty.
[1:15:34] Maybe in you there's no patience.
[1:15:36] [Music]
[1:15:40] Maybe in you there's no love.
[1:15:45] And God knows that you're his children
[1:15:49] and he creates.
[1:15:52] He arranges himself with the devil
[1:15:56] and the Satan will come to you
[1:16:00] to do a wrong to you. Amen. Amen.
[1:16:04] But when you're a child of God,
[1:16:07] you will seize yourself
[1:16:10] and you will return to God. You will
[1:16:13] repent.
[1:16:15] You will recognize that
[1:16:17] and in that instant
[1:16:20] you will pray to God.
[1:16:22] You will cry before your God at whom you
[1:16:25] have done wrong.
[1:16:28] At whom you have disobeyed
[1:16:31] and your God is there to save you.
[1:16:34] Why does he do that?
[1:16:37] Is to bring you closer to him.
[1:16:41] Because you let yourself go by your own
[1:16:44] understanding,
[1:16:46] by your own will.
[1:16:49] You're saying, "I have to do this.
[1:16:52] Nobody is above me.
[1:16:55] Let me do this.
[1:16:57] And when you do your own will,
[1:17:00] your own will will cost you.
[1:17:04] And that's why you need you start to
[1:17:06] cry.
[1:17:08] And when you start draping your tears
[1:17:10] before your God,
[1:17:12] he will accept you, my son, my daughter.
[1:17:16] And he will wipe your tears. Amen. Amen.
[1:17:21] So you make go beyond. Amen. Amen.
[1:17:42] Paragraph.
[1:17:59] [Music]
[1:18:06] And as I noticed then God permitted
[1:18:09] Satan to give him a give him the test
[1:18:12] and oh they tested them by the fire.
[1:18:16] They tested them also by the lion's den.
[1:18:19] And every instant God brought them out
[1:18:23] more victorious. Amen. Amen.
[1:18:28] And you look at the trials that you're
[1:18:30] going through.
[1:18:34] These people that we saw here, we'll see
[1:18:35] it later on. They tested them in the
[1:18:38] fire
[1:18:40] in the uh fire furnace
[1:18:46] and in the lion's den where the lions
[1:18:48] were hungry. That's right.
[1:18:51] They did no wrong.
[1:18:55] But look what happened to them. Amen.
[1:18:58] Amen.
[1:19:00] They were firm before their God.
[1:19:04] And look at you at what condition that
[1:19:07] you are.
[1:19:10] What situation or trials that you're
[1:19:12] facing? Amen. Amen.
[1:19:16] And over here it was God who provoked
[1:19:19] those situations.
[1:19:23] Many are the testings of the righteous.
[1:19:29] But God deliverth him out of them all.
[1:19:33] Here the prophet is saying that all
[1:19:36] there's not one trial that God cannot
[1:19:39] deliver you out of. Amen. Amen.
[1:19:44] How marvelous that is.
[1:19:47] How we appreciate that.
[1:19:52] trials, tribulation, test,
[1:19:57] all working for good to those that love
[1:19:59] God.
[1:20:02] After a while,
[1:20:07] God can see then that he can put his
[1:20:10] trust in you.
[1:20:14] Then he'll do great things for you.
[1:20:17] Amen.
[1:20:19] You notice um usually
[1:20:26] when we deviate from the word of God,
[1:20:30] God is always in his word.
[1:20:36] Every single time you will take
[1:20:38] negligent to God's word.
[1:20:42] In that same hour, that's when the devil
[1:20:44] will play with you.
[1:20:46] That's when the the devil will try to
[1:20:48] claim you and will hate you.
[1:20:52] And if you're a child of God,
[1:20:56] you will return to your father
[1:20:59] and he will forgive you
[1:21:02] in paragraph 31
[1:21:10] say
[1:21:23] Now
[1:21:31] let's go to 30. Now we find out then
[1:21:34] that Daniel became an instrument in the
[1:21:37] hand of God.
[1:21:41] [Music]
[1:21:48] Daniel became an instrument in the hand
[1:21:50] of God while he was away from his own
[1:21:53] people, out of his own city, away from
[1:21:57] his own church in a strange land. God
[1:22:00] used him
[1:22:05] church. Daniel here
[1:22:07] far away from his people, far away from
[1:22:09] his family,
[1:22:12] far away from his um church
[1:22:16] and he was firm.
[1:22:19] How about you?
[1:22:21] In your family,
[1:22:24] in your own church,
[1:22:26] in your own country,
[1:22:32] and you're sinning like there's I don't
[1:22:35] know what.
[1:22:39] You're in church.
[1:22:43] And maybe you're even serving God
[1:22:48] and you're residing in the wrong in sin.
[1:22:55] Daniel was far away from his country,
[1:22:57] far away from his family,
[1:23:00] far away from his church.
[1:23:03] Let's take the church as his bride
[1:23:06] and you the servant of God.
[1:23:09] You're close to your wife.
[1:23:13] And you're sinning.
[1:23:16] You're in your own village, your city,
[1:23:18] but you're sinning.
[1:23:26] Is that truly? Is that truly the spirit
[1:23:28] that was in Christ that is in you that
[1:23:30] is in us?
[1:23:36] Because if that spirit that was in
[1:23:37] Christ dwells in us,
[1:23:40] We will have the desire that were in
[1:23:42] Christ.
[1:23:45] We will be dressed with those desire
[1:23:49] to do good
[1:23:51] instead of doing wrong evil
[1:23:58] when we stand behind these pulpits.
[1:24:03] I'm not here to attack the
[1:24:04] denominations.
[1:24:07] I was never in denominations.
[1:24:12] So what I am attacking with the people
[1:24:14] of my house.
[1:24:18] So if I if I am going to talk, I would
[1:24:20] talk to the people in my house. Amen.
[1:24:23] Because usually we say the people of the
[1:24:26] world they're doing this, they're doing
[1:24:29] sin.
[1:24:31] They're um lying. They're they're
[1:24:34] stealing.
[1:24:37] they're living an unclean life.
[1:24:41] But we we find out
[1:24:46] that the prophet say we'll find it here
[1:24:48] somewhere
[1:24:52] of a tree that was double. Amen. Amen.
[1:24:58] that dwells with us
[1:25:03] but can also do all kinds of wrong or
[1:25:05] evil towards us.
[1:25:13] Like it is written in the exposition of
[1:25:15] the seven church ages.
[1:25:19] I will read
[1:25:21] in pages.
[1:25:23] [Music]
[1:25:25] Give me a few minutes. Give me a little
[1:25:28] second. Okay.
[1:25:34] I'm in the page
[1:25:37] in the age of um
[1:25:42] and we're in that age of La
[1:25:46] the Christian of the age of Laudia
[1:25:50] towards the bottom
[1:25:53] it is written this
[1:25:57] [Music]
[1:25:59] we see now why there's two vine
[1:26:04] There is a true vine and a false one.
[1:26:06] Amen. Amen.
[1:26:11] We see now why Abraham had two sons.
[1:26:15] One is of the flesh.
[1:26:18] He was persecuting Isaac. Amen.
[1:26:23] And the other was based on the promises.
[1:26:28] We see that the same parent
[1:26:31] produced two twins.
[1:26:37] One knew and loved the things of God.
[1:26:47] And the other one knew a very good part
[1:26:50] of the same truth.
[1:26:54] But he was not of the same spirit.
[1:26:59] which made him persecute the elect um
[1:27:02] the elect child.
[1:27:08] God did not find pleasure to rebuke him.
[1:27:15] He he rebuked He rebuked them by love
[1:27:19] for the sake of the elect.
[1:27:25] The elect cannot persecute the elect.
[1:27:29] No my brother nor my sister.
[1:27:32] An elect persecuting an elect. No sir.
[1:27:38] I'm standing at the pulpit that I go
[1:27:40] persecute brother Kimma or brother John
[1:27:44] or who or who else. That mean I am not
[1:27:48] an elect. Amen. Amen.
[1:27:53] The elect cannot persecute the elect.
[1:27:59] The elect cannot do wrong to an elect.
[1:28:03] [Music]
[1:28:05] It's those that are the the reprimment
[1:28:08] that are doing that to the elected
[1:28:13] and that are destroying them. Amen.
[1:28:16] Amen.
[1:28:18] They truly destroy them. Oh.
[1:28:24] Oh. The reprimand or the repro the
[1:28:29] repro
[1:28:31] they appear to be religious.
[1:28:35] They're in a message.
[1:28:38] They're covered with quotes.
[1:28:42] Someone can do you wrong.
[1:28:45] Let that come to you with a citation,
[1:28:48] with a quote saying that you can support
[1:28:49] it. You're a brother. You can support
[1:28:52] it. Amen.
[1:28:56] But there are certain sins sin that are
[1:28:58] unforgivable. What is the sin that's
[1:29:00] unforgivable?
[1:29:03] It's the
[1:29:05] it's you know the word and you're
[1:29:06] rejecting the word. You know what is
[1:29:08] right
[1:29:09] and you're not doing what is right.
[1:29:12] That is a sin, an unforgivable sin
[1:29:17] when you're persecuting an elect.
[1:29:21] May God be glorified.
[1:29:26] That's why we must pay close attention.
[1:29:33] The prophet of God gives an advice.
[1:29:39] Oh elect of God,
[1:29:43] be on your guard.
[1:29:46] Study carefully.
[1:29:49] Work to your salvation.
[1:29:55] With fear and trembling.
[1:29:59] Put your confidence in God
[1:30:04] and fortify yourself by his power.
[1:30:08] Your adversary, the devil,
[1:30:11] he's roaming like a roaring lion,
[1:30:16] seeking whom he shall devour.
[1:30:21] You must stay, dwell in the prayer and
[1:30:23] be firm, where in the end time
[1:30:30] the true and the false vine
[1:30:33] both vine are immaturity.
[1:30:38] is
[1:30:41] it's right before they bloom. The wheat
[1:30:45] bloom.
[1:30:51] This we has to be a euical from the
[1:30:56] church
[1:30:58] has to be tied around before they be
[1:31:00] burned. They have to be gathered and
[1:31:01] tied before they be burned. Amen. Amen.
[1:31:05] May God be worshiped.
[1:31:08] [Music]
[1:31:10] My brothers and sisters, we're in the
[1:31:11] end time.
[1:31:17] [Music]
[1:31:20] You cannot have a good fellowship with
[1:31:22] God
[1:31:26] without first having something. Amen.
[1:31:28] Amen.
[1:31:36] You cannot act or be led by your own
[1:31:38] will.
[1:31:39] Meet God. Amen. Amen.
[1:31:44] You need the word of God to meet God.
[1:31:47] The word the word of God is his will.
[1:31:50] Amen. Amen.
[1:31:54] I will read something.
[1:32:07] The prophet was talking about how Daniel
[1:32:09] was an instrument in the hands of God.
[1:32:14] Now you could be far away.
[1:32:22] You can be away from whatever you may
[1:32:24] be. You can be away from all your loved
[1:32:27] ones or you can be away from your
[1:32:30] church,
[1:32:33] but you can still be an instrument in
[1:32:35] the hands of God
[1:32:38] because God will because Daniel was an
[1:32:40] instrument in the hands of God.
[1:32:47] God can use you for a testimony. Amen.
[1:32:55] or for anything that he wishes to use
[1:32:58] you for.
[1:33:05] I'll read a little bit in I know 1960
[1:33:08] April 17
[1:33:17] in paragraph in paragraph 28 it is
[1:33:20] written in one of the scriptures in the
[1:33:22] Bible
[1:33:31] that trials are brought up that trials
[1:33:34] are brought upon us are more precious to
[1:33:38] us than gold itself. Amen. Amen.
[1:33:47] Excuse me for an instant.
[1:33:56] It's God who sends us the trials.
[1:34:02] When does he sends us the trials?
[1:34:08] after we become his property. Amen.
[1:34:11] Amen. Amen.
[1:34:14] confession. After our confessions,
[1:34:18] our baptism
[1:34:24] and our promise to walk in life for him.
[1:34:29] Then every trial that comes upon us
[1:34:35] is to perfect us.
[1:34:39] It's for a a goal to perfect us for his
[1:34:43] glory. That's right.
[1:34:50] [Music]
[1:34:55] And it is to bring us to a place where
[1:34:58] God can make himself more real to us
[1:35:02] than he was before the trials.
[1:35:07] imagine you could come to God
[1:35:10] [Music]
[1:35:12] and you started a light um a loosely
[1:35:16] life
[1:35:18] and you're deviating away from God.
[1:35:20] You're getting away from God.
[1:35:22] Now the trials will come to hate you.
[1:35:27] You want to touch on this and it doesn't
[1:35:29] work.
[1:35:32] You want to advance and it's not
[1:35:34] working.
[1:35:35] [Music]
[1:35:37] And your God would tell you that you
[1:35:39] must return.
[1:35:41] Everything that you're touching, he is
[1:35:42] hating.
[1:35:47] When he is hidden, you don't you do not
[1:35:48] have discernment
[1:35:53] because you're walking based on your
[1:35:54] based upon your own will,
[1:35:57] not the will of God.
[1:36:01] You're trying to make your own will to
[1:36:03] be the will of God and that will never
[1:36:06] work.
[1:36:09] When you're forcing your will to become
[1:36:11] the will of God, God will leave you.
[1:36:15] You will think that you're prospering.
[1:36:18] You will think that you're prospering.
[1:36:22] But when God will touch somewhere
[1:36:25] that where you were lifted off, you will
[1:36:28] fall all the way beneath.
[1:36:31] You will fall all the way to the ground.
[1:36:33] Amen. Amen.
[1:36:36] Because our God is not a
[1:36:39] He's not a big God. He is our father.
[1:36:43] When there's problem, he will spank you.
[1:36:46] Amen. Amen. Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:36:52] May God be with worship.
[1:36:58] I'll jump a little
[1:37:06] reading paragraph 30.
[1:37:10] And remember, in all things,
[1:37:18] Satan tries to make us nervous and upset
[1:37:21] us
[1:37:23] to get us to think.
[1:37:28] Oh, why did this happen?
[1:37:32] My brother, my sister, what happened
[1:37:34] happened?
[1:37:36] Well, God is waiting for you
[1:37:38] is a good confession.
[1:37:41] fix your life
[1:37:43] and continue walking.
[1:37:46] It's not why why why
[1:37:51] instead of crying for the why.
[1:37:54] You need to pray God. Return to God
[1:37:59] and um cry to God. Forgive me that I am
[1:38:04] your daughter, your son, that I am your
[1:38:06] daughter.
[1:38:09] And if there's a person that you've
[1:38:10] wronged,
[1:38:12] that person,
[1:38:14] you need to fix it with them.
[1:38:17] You need to see them and to fix with
[1:38:20] them
[1:38:21] in humility,
[1:38:23] not in arrogance.
[1:38:25] To say that, oh, I already asked you
[1:38:27] forgiveness. No, sir.
[1:38:30] It's you who wronged them. You need to
[1:38:33] humble yourself
[1:38:36] and the Lord God will give you
[1:38:37] forgiveness that that person will give
[1:38:40] unto you. Amen. Amen.
[1:38:45] In paragraph 61
[1:38:49] crucifix in paragraph 60 actually. And
[1:38:52] they have to have a crucifixion
[1:38:58] before you can have a resurrection.
[1:39:03] And before the church will ever be able
[1:39:05] to see the resurrected power,
[1:39:11] before
[1:39:13] I can ever see a new ministry take place
[1:39:17] myself,
[1:39:21] before you can enter into a new
[1:39:22] fellowship with God,
[1:39:27] there has to got to be a self
[1:39:30] crucification.
[1:39:33] So that there come so that there can
[1:39:35] come a resurrection. You need to die on
[1:39:38] yourself.
[1:39:40] You need to die to your own will.
[1:39:44] Me
[1:39:47] you find yourself that maybe you're
[1:39:48] beautiful.
[1:39:50] Like I was telling to my children's
[1:39:53] I was telling to my daughters
[1:39:58] when you're taking driver's ed and
[1:39:59] they're teaching you how to drive.
[1:40:04] I have never seen you take those
[1:40:06] practice car bringing it home.
[1:40:10] They do not bring it home.
[1:40:13] So my daughters
[1:40:16] you are not
[1:40:22] You are not those practice cars that
[1:40:24] people have to get on and practice so
[1:40:26] they may go somewhere.
[1:40:30] I was not talking.
[1:40:32] You do not need to do that. Do not do
[1:40:34] it.
[1:40:36] You are not a practice car
[1:40:39] that that men have to come and practice
[1:40:42] in your body
[1:40:44] to go exercise
[1:40:47] in their own marriage.
[1:40:49] No,
[1:40:51] that's the the gospel
[1:40:53] that that the prophet has preached.
[1:40:57] No, you're not there
[1:41:00] like we see in today's day.
[1:41:04] certain pastor or men of God
[1:41:08] or the religious ones,
[1:41:10] the religious men
[1:41:13] that are preaching to the married woman
[1:41:17] that every man
[1:41:19] may be a servant of God.
[1:41:22] They have
[1:41:25] they have their in their side friends
[1:41:29] that they may talk dirty talk and
[1:41:32] comfort themselves and allow themselves
[1:41:34] to play with each other with the um
[1:41:37] woman of someone else. Those are in the
[1:41:39] message.
[1:41:41] Do not do it. My my um daughters, my
[1:41:44] sisters,
[1:41:46] do not do it.
[1:41:48] Those are the representative of the
[1:41:50] devil. Those are the devil in flesh
[1:41:55] that will come in thinking that they're
[1:41:56] your brother.
[1:41:59] Those are not your brother. Amen. Amen.
[1:42:04] That's the devil.
[1:42:07] It's a person in the form of religion
[1:42:11] that could destroy a whole household, a
[1:42:13] whole family. Amen. Amen.
[1:42:16] Do not do it.
[1:42:20] You're not a You're not a training
[1:42:22] ground.
[1:42:25] That people had to come and applied that
[1:42:28] and test. Amen. Amen.
[1:42:31] [Music]
[1:42:33] So you must keep your body jealously.
[1:42:36] You must keep it.
[1:42:38] So you may be honored before God and
[1:42:40] before men.
[1:42:44] That honor will be in the eyes of God
[1:42:46] and before the man. Yes sir. Amen. Amen.
[1:42:54] I will read still in the same title. I
[1:42:56] know 1960
[1:42:59] February 17
[1:43:08] in paragraph
[1:43:12] 47 of I know.
[1:43:20] It was until the Hebrew children was
[1:43:23] forced into the f the fiery furnace
[1:43:29] on one of their most outstanding trials
[1:43:36] that they're seeing one like the son of
[1:43:38] God standing among them
[1:43:41] among them.
[1:43:44] Their
[1:43:49] troubles produce the son of God standing
[1:43:52] among them
[1:43:56] in the breeze to wave away the heat.
[1:44:01] But until they went into the fire,
[1:44:06] that's when did the comforter appeared.
[1:44:16] Usually in your prayer you say, "My
[1:44:17] comforter, my comforter, when have he
[1:44:19] ever comforted you?"
[1:44:28] And now you find yourself fallen in a
[1:44:30] tribulation, in a test, or in a trial,
[1:44:36] and you continue to cry. Why?
[1:44:41] Because in that time that's when the
[1:44:43] comforter comes to comfort you
[1:44:47] to tell you my brother my son my
[1:44:50] daughter
[1:44:52] in this tribulation I am with you
[1:44:56] I was I was with Shadrach Meshach in the
[1:45:00] furnace
[1:45:02] you my sister whatever you're going
[1:45:04] through I am also with
[1:45:07] I was with Daniel in the lion Then
[1:45:11] in that in this tribulation I am with
[1:45:13] you
[1:45:17] when the children of Israel was going
[1:45:19] through the Red Sea.
[1:45:23] Maybe you're in front of a situation for
[1:45:25] you that is the river the Red Sea
[1:45:28] because the sea you cannot go through
[1:45:30] it.
[1:45:34] through it.
[1:45:39] So let the person who let the children
[1:45:41] of Israel,
[1:45:43] he is not far away from you this
[1:45:45] evening.
[1:45:47] He is right near you and he is also in
[1:45:50] you
[1:45:53] even in the boat when the disciples were
[1:45:55] with Jesus.
[1:45:58] It was not them that provoked the storm.
[1:46:02] They did not call for the storm.
[1:46:05] They didn't signal for the storm,
[1:46:08] but the creator of the storm was with
[1:46:10] them
[1:46:13] in your tribulation. You had to know
[1:46:15] that he is the creator that in your
[1:46:17] tribulation in your sickness, he is the
[1:46:19] one that created all things.
[1:46:22] He's the one that can command this
[1:46:24] sickness.
[1:46:26] He is with you.
[1:46:28] It's it only takes
[1:46:31] it only takes for you to have um
[1:46:34] confidence in him.
[1:46:40] The prophet of God said when the
[1:46:41] minister is standing at the pulpit,
[1:46:45] everything is possible for your
[1:46:46] salvation this evening. Everything is
[1:46:49] possible
[1:46:51] for your healing this evening.
[1:46:54] May it be cancer.
[1:46:58] What is cancer before God?
[1:47:01] What is sickness before God? This
[1:47:03] evening,
[1:47:06] God is way bigger than all of those.
[1:47:09] Amen. I'm going to drop a little
[1:47:16] paragraph 45.
[1:47:19] Every believer,
[1:47:22] every Christian believer, that mean
[1:47:24] there must be believers that are not
[1:47:25] Christian.
[1:47:29] There are certain believers that are not
[1:47:31] Christian.
[1:47:33] They also go to church with us,
[1:47:37] but they are not Christians.
[1:47:40] [Music]
[1:47:45] Paragraph 85.
[1:47:51] 84. Every Christian believer has to be
[1:47:54] pushed into those trials.
[1:47:58] My brother, my sister, if you're pushed
[1:47:59] into those trials,
[1:48:02] if you were visited by the son of the
[1:48:03] devil,
[1:48:05] [Music]
[1:48:06] you must know that you're a child of
[1:48:07] God, that you're a daughter of God.
[1:48:12] It's God who allowed you to go through
[1:48:14] that.
[1:48:16] And you can go back and look where you
[1:48:18] pass. That God gave you victory.
[1:48:22] He didn't give victory to whoever.
[1:48:25] He didn't give whoever the victory.
[1:48:29] So you must rejoice.
[1:48:32] You have to know that God was the one
[1:48:34] who allowed it. Amen.
[1:48:37] So you may have a testimony
[1:48:41] that there are certain people that could
[1:48:42] go all the way to the frontier
[1:48:45] that have not fallen. Amen. Amen.
[1:48:50] Because there will be certain people
[1:48:51] that will give excuses.
[1:48:54] He said that we fall because of this
[1:48:57] because we were like this in that day.
[1:48:59] They will say look my son look at my
[1:49:02] daughter.
[1:49:03] Look at my son and my daughter. They
[1:49:05] went for but look where they stopped.
[1:49:09] You become a testimony.
[1:49:12] So take courage.
[1:49:22] He says this,
[1:49:28] "Every Christian believer has to be put
[1:49:31] on the ash heap.
[1:49:39] You know the ashes when they take the
[1:49:40] wounds, the branches and you call the
[1:49:43] fire. It's burning. Those those little
[1:49:47] dust is what we call ashes. Meaning you
[1:49:49] fell all the way down. You find yourself
[1:49:52] in a condition that you're down all the
[1:49:54] way in the ashes.
[1:49:57] Why do God put you in the ashes he when
[1:50:00] you arrive at the ashes he
[1:50:04] go now brings forth another experience.
[1:50:09] That's what the prophet of God is saying
[1:50:14] so that he can come forth with an
[1:50:16] experience
[1:50:18] that I know that my redeemer liveth
[1:50:22] that your redeemer is alive. Amen. Amen.
[1:50:30] We don't come here this evening
[1:50:33] just to sit and talk about some
[1:50:35] historical affair.
[1:50:39] which is all true.
[1:50:44] But we come here with a testimony this
[1:50:46] morning.
[1:50:48] I know that Jesus Christ is the son of
[1:50:50] God.
[1:50:51] I know it beyond any shadow of a doubt.
[1:50:56] I know that he raised from the dead and
[1:50:59] he lives in me today.
[1:51:02] He is mine and I am his. I am a joint
[1:51:06] hair with him in the kingdom of God.
[1:51:12] Are you sick?
[1:51:14] Be certain of God.
[1:51:17] And the doctor says that you need an
[1:51:19] operation. You You haven't got money to
[1:51:22] do it.
[1:51:25] You have a need. The Lord God is asking
[1:51:28] you, do you have a need to be healed? He
[1:51:31] is the same tonight.
[1:51:34] He is the same tonight. Amen.
[1:51:38] I'm jumping a little.
[1:51:41] He tells us,
[1:51:46] I believe, that God
[1:51:49] evil
[1:51:51] in paragraph 272.
[1:52:09] 258.
[1:52:22] Be a Christian of good reputation,
[1:52:26] for we are aliens here.
[1:52:30] This is not our home.
[1:52:32] Our home is above.
[1:52:36] We are sons and daughters of the king.
[1:52:43] Let our lives be a reputable life.
[1:52:48] Their life
[1:52:51] there live a life that honor that we
[1:52:54] claim to be a Christian. And if you
[1:52:57] can't live that kind of life, then stop
[1:53:00] being called a Christian
[1:53:02] because you're only bringing reproach.
[1:53:06] You're only bringing reproach upon the
[1:53:08] cause.
[1:53:13] Is your life worthy of the gospel?
[1:53:18] Let me let me convince you. Let me um
[1:53:24] let me let me beg you as a minister.
[1:53:31] Let me um beg you in the in the name of
[1:53:34] Jesus Christ.
[1:53:38] That was the prophet that was like
[1:53:41] begging.
[1:53:43] Run away from the anger of this.
[1:53:47] Don't serve the god of this evil age.
[1:53:52] The god of this evil age is is
[1:53:55] hypocrisy. Amen.
[1:53:57] Amen.
[1:54:01] It's uncleanliness.
[1:54:04] Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen.
[1:54:19] Oh, I know you say it's good. They're
[1:54:22] fine. Exactly.
[1:54:26] Exactly. A mixed tree.
[1:54:31] You you cannot mix knowledge with God's
[1:54:34] word. Somebody is coming with you with
[1:54:36] knowledge
[1:54:38] starting to talk to you about something
[1:54:40] else deviating you you away from the
[1:54:42] word of God.
[1:54:46] May you be a male or a female. Get away
[1:54:49] from that those type of people.
[1:54:52] Any type of relationship that you may
[1:54:54] have with them. Any type of relationship
[1:54:56] that you may have or friendship that you
[1:54:57] may have with them. Amen. Amen.
[1:55:01] You need to get away from those type of
[1:55:03] men.
[1:55:07] May God be praised.
[1:55:09] I like to go fast.
[1:55:17] He says something here
[1:55:22] [Music]
[1:55:25] that the god of this evil age is married
[1:55:28] with a man.
[1:55:35] If it
[1:55:48] the God of this evil age.
[1:55:53] A woman is married with a man
[1:55:56] and she goes out
[1:55:59] and makes love with another man
[1:56:03] and has an affair with him
[1:56:07] and and come back to her husband.
[1:56:13] He should kick her out. Is that right?
[1:56:17] She must be true to him
[1:56:21] cuz she is vowed to him.
[1:56:28] And the bride of Christ is vowed to
[1:56:30] Christ by a vow.
[1:56:33] And he is the word.
[1:56:40] Not even a wink at the other side.
[1:56:47] A woman should not even wink at another
[1:56:50] man.
[1:56:56] She should she should make no signs no
[1:56:59] emotions
[1:57:02] no emotions to
[1:57:05] she should make no signs no emotions at
[1:57:08] all towards him. For she is absolutely a
[1:57:11] bride to one group to one bridegroom.
[1:57:15] [Music]
[1:57:20] Meaning we are not supposed to make a
[1:57:23] wink or wink at another word because our
[1:57:26] bridegroom is Christ and he is jealous.
[1:57:31] Amen.
[1:57:33] You see
[1:57:40] here in
[1:57:42] the god of this evil age in paragraph
[1:57:50] Notice the children of of obedience and
[1:57:53] disobedience have nothing in common.
[1:57:58] It's like it's like we're in a message.
[1:58:02] It's like we're in a message. We have no
[1:58:04] relationship with heathens. We have no
[1:58:07] uh we cannot marry or espouse an
[1:58:10] unbeliever.
[1:58:13] [Music]
[1:58:16] We cannot go and espouse someone else's
[1:58:18] wife that are in the world.
[1:58:24] The man is still alive and you're going
[1:58:27] to espouse a woman of the man that's
[1:58:30] still alive
[1:58:35] or the man the husband is still alive
[1:58:38] and you're going to the wife and
[1:58:39] proposing to the wife saying that I will
[1:58:41] marry you.
[1:58:45] while you're in the message and you're
[1:58:47] married, for example. Amen. Amen.
[1:58:52] That is the representative of the devil.
[1:58:54] Exactly right.
[1:59:03] They disobedient worship their God. Oh,
[1:59:07] they say we believe the Bible.
[1:59:11] mixed. Yes, it's a mixed tree.
[1:59:20] See, they add the world and knowledge to
[1:59:24] it.
[1:59:27] Satan's tree mixed.
[1:59:31] See,
[1:59:35] she took from Satan's tree good and
[1:59:39] evil.
[1:59:43] Oh, we believe the word
[1:59:46] surely, but not all of it.
[1:59:50] Eve believed the word, too.
[1:59:55] But let Satan take his people
[1:59:59] and pervert it a little bit. That's what
[2:00:03] it is.
[2:00:06] The Bible says,
[2:00:10] the Bible say, "Whosoever shall add one
[2:00:12] word or take one word from me,
[2:00:18] the prophet says he is the same, he's
[2:00:20] still the same yesterday, today, and
[2:00:22] forever." Notice
[2:00:25] meaning the person who added or taken
[2:00:31] are doing evil like the snake had done
[2:00:33] in the garden of Eden.
[2:00:36] He has the same punishment. Amen. Amen.
[2:00:42] Because he's saying that God is the same
[2:00:44] yesterday, today, and forever.
[2:00:50] The serpent who has sinned and done that
[2:00:52] remained broken down to the curse that
[2:00:55] God had um rendered him. That's right.
[2:00:58] Amen.
[2:01:03] This evil age is this evil age is of
[2:01:06] darkness
[2:01:09] yet belongs to church.
[2:01:14] [Music]
[2:01:16] Their God
[2:01:17] their God. They love him for it. The way
[2:01:20] he lets them,
[2:01:27] they have no condemnation.
[2:01:29] Nothing brothers, nothing bothers them
[2:01:32] as long as they belong to a church.
[2:01:38] Balam taught this the church the same
[2:01:41] thing.
[2:01:45] But we're all the same. Mm- mm. We're
[2:01:47] not.
[2:01:48] [Music]
[2:01:52] Someone comes tell you that we're the
[2:01:54] same human. We're all humans. No, no,
[2:01:55] no. We're not the same. We're not the
[2:01:57] same thing.
[2:01:59] That's what Ba Bum tried to do.
[2:02:03] You have to remember it was an
[2:02:04] unforgivable sin.
[2:02:07] Three times in the Bible,
[2:02:11] three times in the Bible for any person
[2:02:14] to add one word of their own
[2:02:16] interpretation to God's word
[2:02:24] after it had been vindicated the truth.
[2:02:27] Amen.
[2:02:36] It's true that in the Garden of Eden,
[2:02:38] one word added caused death in the world
[2:02:41] that we're living in.
[2:02:46] When Bum added the word saying that
[2:02:48] we're all the same,
[2:02:55] they God never did forgive Israel that
[2:03:01] every one of them perished in the
[2:03:03] wilderness.
[2:03:11] So now I'll end just be a bit patient
[2:03:14] with me.
[2:03:23] [Music]
[2:03:28] Every every one of them perish in the
[2:03:31] wilderness except the three that God
[2:03:33] brought out.
[2:03:36] [Music]
[2:03:39] Jesus said there they're everyone dead
[2:03:43] that's eternally separated. Amen. Amen.
[2:03:49] [Music]
[2:03:52] They're all gone. Never was forgiven.
[2:03:55] It's an unpardonable sin.
[2:04:01] Never forgive them. Oh my.
[2:04:05] Flee ate children of the evening light.
[2:04:09] Amen. Amen.
[2:04:13] May God be praised.
[2:04:24] [Music]
[2:04:37] So you have to flee like the prophet
[2:04:38] said he said you feel it. Let me tell
[2:04:41] you, you let somebody come at your house
[2:04:44] and don't like you very much sat in your
[2:04:47] house just a little bit and feel that
[2:04:50] funny feeling.
[2:04:55] Someone meaning someone meaning someone
[2:04:59] that you know that he doesn't like you.
[2:05:02] Listen now to the prophet.
[2:05:09] Multiply that feeling. Multiply that by
[2:05:13] 14,000. Now
[2:05:18] then you get what I'm talking about.
[2:05:21] Those
[2:05:23] type of people will you approach them
[2:05:25] pastor
[2:05:27] a person that does not like you that he
[2:05:30] comes to sit near you the prophet is
[2:05:33] saying multiply that by 14,000
[2:05:36] and after that you will understand what
[2:05:38] he's talking about
[2:05:42] may God be praised may God help us
[2:05:48] then you get into a place where
[2:05:50] everybody loves loves you.
[2:05:53] That welcoming feeling
[2:05:56] just Oh my
[2:06:01] and you could just stay there forever.
[2:06:04] See?
[2:06:06] Amen.
[2:06:11] That's a See, it's a spirit.
[2:06:18] I'm running fast. We can jump a bit.
[2:06:23] We're gonna jump certain things
[2:06:32] in paragraph.
[2:06:45] What? What makes good woman? What makes
[2:06:49] good women pull on them vulgar clothes
[2:06:52] and get out there?
[2:06:59] [Music]
[2:07:10] What makes even now when it's still cold
[2:07:14] little 16-year-old girls with clothes on
[2:07:17] that she ought to wear she ought not to
[2:07:20] wear before her mother
[2:07:24] and out on the street.
[2:07:29] Usually you um you people like to
[2:07:32] condemn us the preachers. Listen to what
[2:07:34] the prophet is saying here.
[2:07:43] Because not that child, that child don't
[2:07:47] know any better.
[2:07:54] But
[2:07:57] that's it. But because some preacher in
[2:08:01] the pulpit failed to hold this post of
[2:08:04] duty,
[2:08:07] like I was telling to my children,
[2:08:09] you're not
[2:08:12] you're not a trash can for a sexual act
[2:08:16] that they may come and touch you.
[2:08:19] When someone is marrying you, they honor
[2:08:21] you. And you have to honor God. And you
[2:08:25] will be happy.
[2:08:27] In that day, I will dance like never
[2:08:30] before because I will be glad. Amen.
[2:08:33] Amen. Amen.
[2:08:37] And you're in the word. Amen. Amen.
[2:08:46] He failed to hold his post of duty to
[2:08:50] smell his homework.
[2:08:56] That's exactly right. Sure. A woman get
[2:08:58] on the street and all sexy dress and
[2:09:00] things like that.
[2:09:11] And the sinners look at them and don't
[2:09:14] and don't know that she is actually just
[2:09:18] as guilty as she lived with that man.
[2:09:30] Jesus
[2:09:38] Jesus said so. Jesus said, "Whosoever
[2:09:42] lookth upon a woman to lust after her,
[2:09:45] have committed adultery with her with
[2:09:47] her in his heart, and will have to
[2:09:50] answer for it at the day of judgment.
[2:09:53] Straight is the gate, and narrow is the
[2:09:55] way." That's right.
[2:10:10] The prophet is saying here paragraph
[2:10:11] 150, I know you think I'm a hard guy.
[2:10:15] I'm not hard. I'm your brother. I love
[2:10:18] you.
[2:10:26] You also my sisters, I am placing myself
[2:10:28] in the place of the past of the prophet.
[2:10:31] I am not hard. I love you. You need to
[2:10:33] run. Run from the wrath that is to come.
[2:10:43] Go to the cross and cry until your heart
[2:10:45] is filled with his spirit.
[2:10:53] [Music]
[2:10:56] They'll turn your back from everything
[2:10:58] of this world and walk godly before him
[2:11:05] with your heart burning for him. Amen.
[2:11:13] Excuse me. I'll close.
[2:11:22] I'll read I'll read somewhere in God's
[2:11:24] provided way for this day
[2:11:28] 1964
[2:11:30] February the 6
[2:11:33] listen to the prophet
[2:11:41] there is no better way for they never
[2:11:44] found a better way for a baby to
[2:11:48] to get what it what it wants,
[2:11:54] then cry for it.
[2:11:58] If you give him a bail
[2:12:01] and you say, "Junior,
[2:12:04] you're only three days.
[2:12:08] [Music]
[2:12:10] But now, when you want to when you want
[2:12:13] your bottle,
[2:12:15] raise your raise up this bell and ring
[2:12:17] it.
[2:12:19] see if that'll work.
[2:12:22] The prophet saying that don't work. It
[2:12:24] won't work.
[2:12:28] The the baby cries for eight for what he
[2:12:32] wants.
[2:12:33] That is God's provided way.
[2:12:37] The louder you cry,
[2:12:40] the louder you cry,
[2:12:46] don't whip the little fellow.
[2:12:50] He is only following God's provided way.
[2:12:54] He wants something to happen. That's
[2:12:57] right.
[2:12:59] It's the only way he knows.
[2:13:02] He It's the only way he knows to call
[2:13:04] his mother.
[2:13:05] Is to scream for it, cry for it.
[2:13:11] Listen to
[2:13:14] God recommends this for his children.
[2:13:18] God recommends this for his believing
[2:13:21] children. He did not he did not not
[2:13:25] intellectual speeches.
[2:13:28] Not some great theology theology
[2:13:31] theology not theology to teach
[2:13:34] theology. Not theology to teach
[2:13:39] but to teach the word the word of the
[2:13:41] the message of the end time.
[2:13:44] [Music]
[2:13:46] Because if you're not taught based on
[2:13:48] the word and the message,
[2:13:51] the Bible say, "My people perish by lack
[2:13:53] of knowledge." And when you don't have
[2:13:56] that understanding, you will perish.
[2:13:59] Somebody will come and deceive you and
[2:14:00] you will let yourself be deceived.
[2:14:03] Somebody will bring you left, you will
[2:14:05] go,
[2:14:09] but if you have the understanding, the
[2:14:11] knowledge, you will say, "No, I will not
[2:14:13] do that." Amen. Amen.
[2:14:21] He says that God wants you to cry for
[2:14:24] your needs.
[2:14:26] That's right. Cry out for it.
[2:14:29] [Music]
[2:14:31] You're too stiff and scr and scrouchy.
[2:14:35] You'll never re you'll never get it.
[2:14:42] If you're ready to limber yourself a
[2:14:44] little and cry,
[2:14:48] God will give it to you.
[2:14:51] He likes to hear his children cry. Cry
[2:14:55] your needs to God. God wants it.
[2:14:59] That's his provided way.
[2:15:02] Cry out for it. That's the way the baby
[2:15:05] cries
[2:15:10] and that's the way he wants you to cry.
[2:15:14] Listen to 52.
[2:15:17] How long does a baby cry?
[2:15:20] [Applause]
[2:15:22] Until he is satisfied.
[2:15:27] And that's the way the believing
[2:15:28] Christian should be God's child. There
[2:15:32] is a problem.
[2:15:34] We will come out of this.
[2:15:37] Your problem is waiting for you after
[2:15:39] this. But you're taking it loosely. And
[2:15:43] the prophet is saying
[2:15:46] the baby will cry until they're
[2:15:49] satisfied. Amen. Amen.
[2:15:53] And he says a Christian, a believing
[2:15:55] Christian should do
[2:16:03] That's the way the belie.
[2:16:09] If you see that God made the promise,
[2:16:13] don't give it up.
[2:16:17] Cry till it's answered.
[2:16:20] Cry.
[2:16:22] Cry till you see God vindicates his
[2:16:25] word. When God vindicates his word
[2:16:30] and proves it's here,
[2:16:34] then you don't have to cry no more
[2:16:37] because you got it.
[2:16:39] Walk away and thank him for it
[2:16:43] until you do that.
[2:16:46] Scream out till you get it.
[2:16:50] Cry out with all your faults till you
[2:16:52] receive it. I like that. Persistence.
[2:16:56] persistence,
[2:16:58] holding on.
[2:17:02] He gave the example of Abraham who
[2:17:04] waited 25 years.
[2:17:09] He was waiting for the u promised son.
[2:17:12] Amen. Amen.
[2:17:16] Now the prophet is also inviting us.
[2:17:19] When you have a problem, you need to you
[2:17:22] need to also do it.
[2:17:25] I read in paragraph 759.
[2:17:29] Yet Abraham had a right to the promise
[2:17:32] just like you this evening. You have a
[2:17:33] right to the promise.
[2:17:36] Healing belongs to you.
[2:17:40] Every blessing belongs to you.
[2:17:45] So why are you not possessing it?
[2:17:48] Because you have never cried.
[2:17:51] You never took those seriously.
[2:17:56] when Hannah had take um her condition
[2:17:58] seriously.
[2:18:03] She even made the the servant of God
[2:18:06] lose his GPS.
[2:18:10] The servant of the Lord did not even
[2:18:12] have discernment
[2:18:14] to understand that Hannah is in the
[2:18:17] church in the house of God and she is
[2:18:20] praying.
[2:18:24] the servant of the go the servant of God
[2:18:26] is saying that you talk wine.
[2:18:29] She said no it's the
[2:18:33] it's the weight of the um case that I
[2:18:35] have that are pushing me. It doesn't
[2:18:38] matter what my husband may tell me or
[2:18:41] may give me
[2:18:43] but I am in need to have a child
[2:18:47] because it's a promise for me.
[2:18:51] You say in the house of the Lord,
[2:18:52] there's no surrender.
[2:18:55] And she she attached herself to that
[2:18:57] promise. And I believe this evening,
[2:19:01] you need to attach yourself to a verse.
[2:19:04] May each of you are attach yourself to a
[2:19:06] verse. Doesn't matter your situation
[2:19:08] this evening. Attach yourself to a
[2:19:10] verse.
[2:19:12] God cannot speak like this in vain.
[2:19:15] Amen. Amen.
[2:19:18] When David,
[2:19:20] when David had picked up the stones,
[2:19:24] they were a small little stone.
[2:19:27] But those small stones,
[2:19:30] God took control of it.
[2:19:33] So he may pierce Goliath
[2:19:36] to make the giant fall.
[2:19:40] So if you take only a scripture this
[2:19:42] evening in the promise of God,
[2:19:45] the giant is before you will fall.
[2:19:54] I wanted to read the prophet.
[2:20:02] Yet Abraham had the right to the promise
[2:20:04] and the promises.
[2:20:06] Yet he had to fight.
[2:20:09] You also have to fight to possess it.
[2:20:13] Amen. Amen.
[2:20:17] There you are the believers today.
[2:20:21] Yeah, we're Yeah, we're air. We know
[2:20:24] that you're heir of all all things.
[2:20:30] Yeah, we're heir of every spiritual
[2:20:32] blessing,
[2:20:34] every physical blessing.
[2:20:38] every blessing in the Bible promise
[2:20:41] every promise.
[2:20:44] Yet you have to fight for every entropy.
[2:20:50] That's God's that's the way God God is
[2:20:53] set up. It has always been like that.
[2:21:00] You have to fight to possess what you
[2:21:02] know is yours.
[2:21:07] Even for your husband, if there's a
[2:21:09] problem, you need to fight if there's a
[2:21:11] problem because it's your husband. Even
[2:21:13] for for your wife, if there's a problem,
[2:21:15] you have to fight for your wife. Even
[2:21:17] for your children, if there's an issue,
[2:21:19] you need to fight for your children
[2:21:21] because they're your children. And the
[2:21:23] prophet is saying, you have to reclaim.
[2:21:24] You have to claim. Amen. Amen.
[2:21:31] They will fight to possess it.
[2:21:34] That's what we must do to save
[2:21:37] the promises is yours.
[2:21:41] But if you ever get
[2:21:44] you ain't going to get it easy.
[2:21:50] So there's promises, but I'm not going
[2:21:52] to obtain it easily.
[2:21:54] Now you're understanding the trials
[2:21:57] that the trials is bringing you closer
[2:21:59] to God. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen.
[2:22:07] I'm going to parachute the m musician
[2:22:09] may come forth. Amen. Amen.
[2:22:16] Amen. I am heir of everything. Amen.
[2:22:20] It's given to me.
[2:22:25] I am an heir. I can claim everything
[2:22:27] that God promised me. It's for me.
[2:22:31] It's my how do you get it?
[2:22:36] By by something you done? No sir.
[2:22:41] It's the unmmerited gift that God gave
[2:22:43] us. And it's ours. It belongs to us.
[2:22:49] Satan cannot hold it.
[2:22:53] If you go to him,
[2:22:56] if you go to Satan
[2:22:59] with the scriptural authorative word was
[2:23:02] saying, saying it is mine, lay it down.
[2:23:07] Amen. Amen. Glory. I like that. Satan,
[2:23:13] lay it down.
[2:23:15] You took it from me. You give it back
[2:23:21] because I'm serving. You notice
[2:23:28] you give it back because I'm serving.
[2:23:30] Notice notice on you.
[2:23:35] I've got the notice written right here
[2:23:37] on the word.
[2:23:40] Heaven and earth will pass away,
[2:23:44] but this notice shall shall not.
[2:23:50] So I come with this notice to serve on
[2:23:53] you.
[2:24:00] Jesus Christ said, "Whatsoever I ask in
[2:24:02] the Father, in the Father's name, he'll
[2:24:05] give you if I say to this mountain, be
[2:24:08] moved, and don't doubt in my heart, but
[2:24:11] but believe, but believe
[2:24:15] that what I've said shall shall come to
[2:24:18] pass, I can have what I said. Lay it
[2:24:22] down.
[2:24:27] That gets him started.
[2:24:32] Don't get him.
[2:24:34] Don't get him started.
[2:24:39] That gets him running. Lay it down
[2:24:42] because I have come with the spiritual
[2:24:44] authority. I am a believer. You get it?
[2:24:47] Yes, sir.
[2:24:51] May God be worshiped.
[2:24:57] He told to Joshua, "Every land that you
[2:24:59] possess."
[2:25:01] Joshua also possessed.
[2:25:04] When he saw that he was facing the
[2:25:06] enemy, a bunch of enemies,
[2:25:09] he stopped the son for 24 hours.
[2:25:13] This evening, just take a scripture,
[2:25:15] take a verse.
[2:25:16] That little stone
[2:25:19] that's in your hand, all it takes is
[2:25:22] something in your hand.
[2:25:25] can pierce the Goliath in your life.
[2:25:28] Amen. Amen.
[2:25:32] Our God,
[2:25:34] he takes what is nothing, what of what
[2:25:37] is of nothing to show his greatness.
[2:25:42] David only has stones and those stones
[2:25:45] pierced Goliath.
[2:25:48] Why? Why? Because he had a commission
[2:25:50] just like you have a commission.
[2:25:53] You have the promises of God.
[2:25:57] All it takes is a a stick in the hand of
[2:26:00] Moses. He delivered the people of God.
[2:26:05] He delivered the people of Israel from
[2:26:07] the hand of Pharaoh.
[2:26:13] It doesn't matter how insignificant the
[2:26:15] stick that he picked up. But when God is
[2:26:17] there, God takes control.
[2:26:21] Take your situation this evening
[2:26:24] with a simple prayer.
[2:26:28] Take a simple scripture
[2:26:32] like Moses took a stick
[2:26:37] like David who picked up a stone.
[2:26:41] Me and you this evening
[2:26:44] let's take only a verse a scripture and
[2:26:48] this sickness will go away. The pastor
[2:26:50] may come,
[2:26:52] the sickness will go away.
[2:26:56] It doesn't matter the situation, it will
[2:26:58] go that will come forth.
[2:27:01] It doesn't matter your situation.
[2:27:03] The prophet of God has said
[2:27:06] that this evening everything is
[2:27:08] possible. You can be saved just like you
[2:27:12] can be healed.
[2:27:14] [Music]
[2:27:16] So, we're inviting the pastor
[2:27:18] who will do a word of prayer
[2:27:22] with a verse that each of us will take
[2:27:24] in their heart
[2:27:26] to conquer the enemy,
[2:27:29] to conquer the devil.
[2:27:31] It doesn't matter your situation. May
[2:27:33] God richly bless you.
[2:27:40] Praise
[2:27:42] God. Let's stand.
[2:27:44] [Applause]
[2:27:47] Do you have your scripture?
[2:27:50] Do you have your verse?
[2:27:52] You have it.
[2:27:54] You know, David was going through a
[2:27:56] trial one time in a scripture
[2:28:00] and the trial was so hard because he was
[2:28:03] coming from his own son.
[2:28:07] There was no time to go to the bush
[2:28:10] because the invasion was getting
[2:28:12] greater. And all he did, he just spoke.
[2:28:16] He said, "Lord,
[2:28:18] turn the council of Ahito
[2:28:21] into foolishness." Amen. That was it.
[2:28:25] And the man whose wisdom was like that
[2:28:28] say the Lord. If he say something, it
[2:28:31] always happened. That man wisdom was
[2:28:34] trouble by his simple prayer. Amen. God
[2:28:40] hide and he reveal himself in
[2:28:42] simplicity.
[2:28:45] He bring trial not to destroy you. After
[2:28:49] trial you'll be settled. You'll be
[2:28:51] refined. You'll be corrected because all
[2:28:55] there's no trial that can come in your
[2:28:57] life that is not connected to your
[2:29:00] purpose.
[2:29:02] Every trial in your life is aligned with
[2:29:06] your purpose. In other words, depending
[2:29:08] on what type of engine you are. That's
[2:29:11] the type of fire you going to go
[2:29:13] through. Stop comparing yourself with
[2:29:16] the next neighbor.
[2:29:18] Stop looking and say, "Why am I the only
[2:29:20] one going through this and everybody in
[2:29:23] the church is going through this?" You
[2:29:24] don't know what everybody's going
[2:29:26] through.
[2:29:27] Amen. Somebody might be healthy in the
[2:29:30] body, but spiritually they are
[2:29:32] disturbed. Somebody might be spiritually
[2:29:35] fine and they're struggling in the body.
[2:29:38] This gentle walk, it's an individual
[2:29:40] walk. It is between you and the Lord.
[2:29:44] Amen. Take that simple scripture. Take
[2:29:47] God at his word. God is simple. God is
[2:29:51] not complicated. God is the one that
[2:29:54] take the word that looks so complicated
[2:29:56] and break it down until you say, "Whoa,
[2:29:59] I see it right there." Because that is
[2:30:01] her purpose. That is his purpose. He
[2:30:04] hide it from the eyes of wise and
[2:30:06] prudent and he revealed them to the
[2:30:09] babes, those that are predestinated. And
[2:30:11] once God revealed it, it doesn't belong
[2:30:14] to God anymore. According to the
[2:30:15] scripture, it belongs to you. Take that
[2:30:18] verse, apply it to your trouble. Right?
[2:30:21] Maybe you have applied many time you say
[2:30:24] I did it over and over and over and over
[2:30:26] it doesn't work. Brother Brandham talked
[2:30:28] to us about I believe it was Benjamin
[2:30:30] Franklin.
[2:30:32] If not it's Thomas Edison the one who
[2:30:35] tried many I don't know how many wires
[2:30:38] tried tried tried today that man is dead
[2:30:40] for years we still enjoying what the man
[2:30:44] discover. Amen. Your persistence will
[2:30:48] save your family.
[2:30:50] Your perseverance will save your
[2:30:52] children. If you give up, maybe you're
[2:30:54] the one God have chosen to hold the
[2:30:57] entire family together. And because of
[2:31:00] you, the family standing. Take that
[2:31:03] simple, very simple smooth stone. He
[2:31:07] took five. He didn't use all five. He
[2:31:11] just used one and one took care of the
[2:31:13] job. There's so many scripture in this
[2:31:15] Bible. Maybe one is important to be
[2:31:19] anointed tonight according to what he
[2:31:21] spoke so we can bring our Goliath down.
[2:31:25] Let's pray. You pray on your own and use
[2:31:29] your scripture.
[2:31:31] [Music]
[2:32:08] Heat. Heat.
[2:32:11] [Music]
[2:33:26] Heavenly Father,
[2:33:28] Lord, we are approaching you humbly
[2:33:30] tonight. Father, thanking you for your
[2:33:33] grace, thanking you for your love,
[2:33:37] thanking you for your mercy, for coming
[2:33:39] down and speaking to our soul, Father.
[2:33:42] Lord, you the author of this walk.
[2:33:46] You're the one that started this
[2:33:48] journey, Lord. And we thank you because
[2:33:51] you are not only alpha, but you you are
[2:33:53] also omega, Lord. Father, we come in
[2:33:57] obedience to your word as you spoke to
[2:34:00] us, Lord Father, tonight to take, Lord,
[2:34:03] Father, that simple stone, that simple
[2:34:06] passage of the scripture and destroy
[2:34:09] what seems to be, Lord, Father, standing
[2:34:11] in our ways for years, a great Goliath
[2:34:14] that has been threatened for days and
[2:34:17] days until, Lord, Father, the entire
[2:34:20] house is terrified because of this
[2:34:23] demon. Lord, I pray in the name of Jesus
[2:34:26] Christ that your mercy goes among every
[2:34:29] family members of this church, those
[2:34:32] that are here and those that are
[2:34:34] streaming online. May Lord, Father,
[2:34:36] every devil from every house Lord, any
[2:34:39] stronghold that has been built around
[2:34:41] Lord be completely destroyed and may you
[2:34:44] set Lord Father your children free Lord
[2:34:48] there is not a time too late Lord.
[2:34:50] Father Lord when the disciple thought
[2:34:52] that Peter was gone at the very eve Lord
[2:34:56] Father that he could be killed Lord you
[2:34:58] send your angel and deliver him Lord
[2:35:01] Father I don't know who is in a tight
[2:35:03] situation that needed a touch and help
[2:35:06] from thee Lord Father I pray that you
[2:35:08] come down Lord and lift up the banner
[2:35:11] upon your children Lord may you provide
[2:35:13] the healing may you provide the solution
[2:35:16] may you provide the deliverance may you
[2:35:19] provide the Holy Spir spirit because the
[2:35:21] hour is very late when we see everything
[2:35:24] that is going around the world Lord.
[2:35:27] Father we can see Lord that our
[2:35:29] departure from this earth to meet you
[2:35:31] into the air is very near and close
[2:35:34] Lord. Father I pray that you take the
[2:35:36] building project unto the hand. You are
[2:35:38] Jehovah Jara Lord. You the one Lord that
[2:35:41] started the work and finish it. Lord as
[2:35:44] you have started may you provide and
[2:35:46] lead everything. Lord, we thank you for
[2:35:48] another inspection that we have passed
[2:35:50] this week, Lord, because every step it
[2:35:53] is taking, Lord, Father, your grace,
[2:35:55] Lord, Father, upon this church to give
[2:35:57] us victory from one side to another,
[2:36:00] Lord. Father, may you strengthen and
[2:36:02] give us travel mercy, Lord, as we will
[2:36:05] go to our respective place. May you
[2:36:07] protect us, Lord, and take the remaining
[2:36:09] of the weak unto their hand. Remove
[2:36:12] everything that the devil is trying,
[2:36:14] Lord, Father, to attack your children,
[2:36:16] Lord. We pray that you Lord strengthen
[2:36:18] brother Pony, strengthen brother Albert
[2:36:21] Lord. Father may you bless them Lord.
[2:36:23] Father remember also the desire of their
[2:36:26] heart Lord as they are giving themsel
[2:36:28] Lord to unto the uh service of your
[2:36:31] kingdom. Lord, I remember the musician,
[2:36:34] Lord, always on point of duty, always
[2:36:37] making an effort to be on time to make
[2:36:40] sure, Lord, Father, they are fresh and

[2:36:44] Lord, the worship according, Lord,
[2:36:46] Father, to the desire of your heart,

[2:36:50] musician, Lord. May you give them the
[2:36:52] desire of their heart, Lord. Father, may
[2:36:55] you remember the technician back there.
[2:36:57] May you remember, Lord, Father, the
[2:36:59] trustee and the deacon and the

[2:37:03] family in this church, Lord. May you
[2:37:05] look at those requests that they have
[2:37:07] been waiting for years, Lord. Father,
[2:37:10] may Lord, something trouble you tonight,
[2:37:12] Lord. Like King Ahazarus was trouble,
[2:37:15] Lord, until they were no sleep, Lord.
[2:37:17] And they have to bring the chronicle,
[2:37:19] Lord. And from the chronicle, Lord,
[2:37:21] Father, you took it to bring, Lord,
[2:37:23] Father, a victory for Morai, Lord.

[2:38:00] blessing for Israel, Lord. Father, under
[2:38:03] the atonement of a physical lamb, Lord,
[2:38:06] but now we have the spiritual one, the
[2:38:08] perfect Lord. Father, not the the the
[2:38:11] the tap, but the antitap itself, Lord.
[2:38:14] Father, may you come down and grant unto
[2:38:16] us, Lord, the desire of our heart, Lord.
