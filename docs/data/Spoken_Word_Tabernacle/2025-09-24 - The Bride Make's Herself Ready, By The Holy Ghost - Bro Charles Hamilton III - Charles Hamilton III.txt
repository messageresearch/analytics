========================================

We'll separate ourselves from all this man-made dogmas and creeds and things and look in the Bible, see what God said about it. He ought to know what he's right. It's his word, his book. It's the reason I like the full gospel. Not half of it, all of it. &gt;&gt; The full gospel. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, and then then he said the first thing you know, here come Andrew running in and saying that this preacher said he saw the Messiah sign over a man. It was a a light like a dove coming down. And the preacher saw it. There's many there. Nobody else saw it but the preacher. So I couldn't hardly go for that. I had heard all kinds of stuff. So I just forgot about it, you know. And one night he come to me and said, "You ought to just go down and listen at him for once. He's going to be down here on the shore the next morning and you ought to go down." Well, I thought poor old Andrew. He and I pulled this boat for a long time. And I remember one day I had a talk with my daddy and he was a good old Pharisee. He just lived in that church, a pillar in it. and his gray hair one night act fishing. We were poor. We had to just live meager as we could. And many times when mother and daddy was living, she used to gather us all around in the morning before we went out to put our nets in the water. We owed debts and we had to have some fish and we would pray to Jehovah to to fill our nets that day. and how daddy would rejoice when we taken a great big catch of fish and get to the bank and get out on the bank and sit down and thank God for giving us the fish for that day. Now we could go pay our debts now and have something to eat for the night and expect the next morning. And one night after we got through thanking the Lord, I remember daddy sat down on the side of the braille of the boat. And he called me over there and he said, "Simon, you know, I have longed all my life to live to see the day when I would see the Messiah." And we've been promised him for many years. All of our people has looked for him. Moses told us he was coming. All the prophets have spoke to him. But Simon's son, we haven't had a prophet among us for hundreds of years. And the church has got off in cold formal condition. But I believe it's nearing the time. If you see my gray hair, I don't suppose I'll live to see it. I'm old now. But Simon, before the Messiah comes, Satan will send out a lot of false stuff first. And there'll be false messiahs come. But I want you to always remember, Simon, don't you never leave this scripture. Our people are told in this Bible that the word of the Lord comes to a prophet. &gt;&gt; A prophet only &gt;&gt; and then first this prophet has to be vindicated by God. &gt;&gt; He has to tell the word and the word has to come to pass time after time. They are born. They're just not just somebody laid hands on them and made them a prophet. They are born. There's a gift of prophecy can come, but a prophet is born a prophet. &gt;&gt; Jeremiah was God said, "Before you is even formed in your mother's wombs, I'll ard you a prophet over the nations." &gt;&gt; John the Baptist 712 years before he's born. Isaiah said he's a voice of one crying in the wilderness. &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ was the son of God before the foundation of the world. &gt;&gt; He was a woman seed that was to bruise the serpent's head. Certainly, God is God places these things. God has set in the church. Apostles, prophets, teachers, pastors, evangelists, all these things God placed in the church. Then there's nine different gifts who operates in that church. But these are offices that goes in the church. And you know, he told me, he said, "Son, we followed Moses and his law. Now Moses told us that this Messiah when he come would be a prophet. So I just thought I would go down and see who this young fellow was stirring up all this emotion down there and said people's being healed by him. So I thought I'd go down and one day when we got the nets all washed and laid out on the bank, he came down to preach and I got me a chunk and sat down up on a piece of driftwood up on the bank. And when he began to speak, uh, I knew that there was something different about this man because he talked like a man that knowed what he was talking about. And when I got up close to him, he looked me right in the face and he said, "Your name is Simon and you are the son of Jonas." He said, "That take it as enough for me." &gt;&gt; Not only did he prove to be the prophet, he knew me before he ever saw me. He knew me and he also knew that godly old father of mine that told me that would be the sign of the Messiah. &gt;&gt; That settled it for me. Oh my. How he was getting all excited too and must have been Philip jumped up said let me [Music] [Music] can be upstanding tonight. Amen. Amen. want to pray committing the service into the hands of the Lord that the Lord himself will take charge tonight that his spirit will take prereeminence and lead the service even as he prepares his vessel to speak tonight.

Father God, we love you, Lord God. We thank you, Father, for your grace, your love, your mercy, Lord. Lord, I've done all that I can as a man, Lord God. And now I pray, Father, that you come down, Lord God, and speak to your people, Lord God. Feed them, Father God. They're here for a reason, Lord. Lord God, every demonic even force that's contrary to you, Father God, we bind it in the name of Jesus Christ, Lord God. Lord God, Jesus Christ's name we pray, Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, um, tonight my subject would be, uh, the bride makes herself ready by the Holy Ghost. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, um, and I don't and with with what the Lord gave me, I'm not even sure if that's a a fair enough title. You know, the Lord gave me so much. I went through like four titles, but the Lord gave me one. So, um, um, so for another, um, another our other opening scripture, we're going to go to Ezekiel 1. I'm going to start with verses 4-5. We're going to be in we're going to be in Ezekiel for the most part. We're going to jump to Revelations 4. Um later on when you get to Ezekiel 1, say amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. So verse four, it reads, "And I looked, and behold, a whirlwind came out of the north. a great cloud and a fire unfolding itself and a brightness was about it and out of the midst thereof as a color of amber and out of the mist of out of the midst of the fire. Amen. Now, I want to take some time and uh just stop right there at that scripture right there because we know exactly what that's talking about. Amen. And you know, I was meditating on it and the Lord just spoke, you know, spoke to me on that scripture. You know, when when you look at it, you have your cloud, got the fire, you got your whirlwind all in that scripture. Amen. And we know each one of those individual physical manifestations is Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; And we know Christ is made perfect in three. Amen. &gt;&gt; And when we look at it, we know the fire. Amen. We know the cloud. But what I want to focus on is that whirlwind. Amen. See, because when we when we speak on that whirlwind, that's when God makes himself manifest on earth. Amen. Because when I was looking at it, you have the cloud, God above us. You have the fire, God with us in the in his children, the pillar of fire. Amen. Then you have the cloud, the whirlwind. Amen. So that whirlwind has to be God when he manifest himself on earth. Amen. So I I looked at it and I wanted to see what brother Brennham said about it. Amen. And in the unveiling of God in um 1964, brother Brenham says Moses one time desired to see God and God told him to stand on the rock. Amen. So him to stand on the revelation. Amen. It says on the rock Moses stood and he seen God pass by. Amen. It says and his back looked like the back of a man. Amen. He says God was in a whirlwind. Amen. See, and then he says again in the mighty God available before us. Amen. See this is the unveiling of God. He unveils himself in that in that whirlwind. Amen. And he says it says um brother Benham says in Job God was so real to him. He wanted to find out if he couldn't go back and knock at his door and have interview with him. &gt;&gt; See, but we find out that God did speak to him. But he was veiled. He was veiled in the form of a whirlwind. Amen. See, and he told Job to gird up his loins and to speak to him like a man. And he came down in a whirlwind and spoke to Job. And he was made known made known to Job through the whirlwind. Amen. Yet he did not he did not exactly see him. He could just hear the wind blowing and turning around the trees and the voice came out of the whirlwind. But God was veiled in the whirlwind. Amen. So we see we look at the scripture. So this is just all God right here. This all the scripture is saying. So So what did God So for God to come and manifest himself in this much. Amen. to show you this is me in all all facets. This is me. Amen. See, so what was so important for him to do that? See, why did he have to do all that? Amen. So, so then um so so then I also wanted to mention, you know, brother Benham, he talks about if you sow the wind, you reap the whirlwind. Amen. He said that many times. He said he always wanted to preach on it, but never but he never got to it. Amen. See, but he did preach on it. Amen. If you go through the message and things, he is he did preach on it. Amen. And uh and see it says it was usually in a negative context because when brother Ben better say you're reaping the whirlwind he would talk about how you know America how you know we're reaping you know all the parties and all the uh all the comedy you know want to have fun all the time. See the they're sewing to the wind. Amen. See and um the whirlwind was you know the wrath that's soon to come. Amen. &gt;&gt; And so um but then you know he comes to the world in one way but he comes to his bride. He comes to the rod as a lion. The bride as a lamb. So that whirlwind is different for us. Amen. See, and I wanted to see, you know, when the Lord is coming to us in that whirlwind, what is happening? Amen. See, and and the handwriting on the wall, Brother Brandon says, "Oh, he rides upon the whirlwind." Hallelujah. His wave is in a whirlwind. See, because when you look at it, Job, see Job, we see wind type trials, wind type war. Amen. See, so Job was going through his own wind at the time. Amen. See, and what was he reaping to that wind? Amen. Because he understood who really was causing the wind. Amen. See, because he rides that wind. Amen. See, because see, because see, he he uses what may seem bad, but it's not exactly bad. Amen. Just like he said, it's a season. Amen. See, see. So, so, so he probably has to see because remember the Michelin statue. Amen. See, it it don't feel good, but he's shaping you shaping you how he's supposed to be. Amen. See? Amen. So when you um so see cuz Job he was going through a trial through his his own winds and he was sewing to those winds but correctly. Amen. See see in that season of winds what are you sewing to? Amen. See see I mean are you sewing to the wind itself? Amen. Or are you sewing to the to the maker of the wind? Amen. See because because look see you have you have u um Lot Lot had eyes. Lot looked. Amen. See, he looked, but then God uh God told Abraham to look. See, God fix Abraham's eyes. Amen. See, so have God fix your eyes through the eyes of faith. Amen. Not not through the eyes of of sensual seeing. Amen. &gt;&gt; See, and and um Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And see, because see what he did was he reaped a conference with God. Amen. See, you reap to those winds and you reap that conference with God that you're seeking for. Amen. See, see what what do you need? What is your need? Amen. Are you are you struggling with something? Amen. Is there a uh is there a a question? Are you stuck between calls or a decision? Amen. What is it? Whatever you need. Amen. Uh uh uh that's when you sew towards that. Amen. In faith and prayer, like brother Benham said, a simple prayer of faith. Amen. And what happens? Amen. He'll come down. Amen. And we know that and he comes down in many different ways as we'll get into later on. He comes down in many different ways. Amen. But primarily today, he he works through man. Amen. As brother Benham said, it's the hardest thing for a man to do is to get for you to receive another man. Amen. Amen. See, because that's how God's working today. Amen. Because it's the pillar of fire now. He's in his people. Amen. He's talking through his people. You have to be sensitive to the spirit. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. Amen. See, see, it says it says in um in uh uh uh brother Brham says in the handwriting on the wall, he says, "Oh, he rides upon the whirlwind." Amen. See, and there's another quote. Brother Brennham says he takes the north, the south, the east, the west, all those winds and he rides them. Amen. See, it says he rides upon the whirlwind. His wave is in the whirlwind. See, and it says that Job, he reaped that conference with the whirlwind. Amen. See, and and what happened? See, uh, brother Brandham says and um, 1965, I have heard, but now I see. He says, so just about that time, this is brother Brennham when the whirlwind came to him. Yes, sir. He says, "So just about that time, I heard something come off the top of the mountain up there. A whirlwind rolling around and around. See, and here come down like that. And the spirit of God moved over the boat and said, "Stand to your feet." Said, "Speak to the dead fish. Say, I give you back your life." Amen. So when you reap that whirlwind, what does it do? Amen. It brings that third pull. Amen. It's it bring it brings it tells you what to say. Amen. See see because because look look. Amen. Look, because you see when we think of the third pull in speaking, Amen. See, it's not it's not you speaking on your own accord. Amen. It's the Lord speaking. Amen. See, because when we speak of Hattie, right, Amen. The Lord spoke through her. Amen. She the Lord told her what to say because she ain't know what to ask for. See, we got many things in our lives we could ask for and issues and and things we want. Amen. But it's it's God in you that'll tell you what to say. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. See? Amen. Because when he reaped that whirlwind, the whirlwind will give you the instruction. Amen. See, because because I was speaking to a brother um I was speaking to a brother recently and he uh we were speaking and you know um there was a quote I never seen before. Brother Benham said uh back in the scriptural days it was so common for men to for God to appear before men. Amen. It was so common but it's not common no more. Amen. Because we got too much too many voices today. Amen. Too much in the way today. Amen. Uh uh too much on the radios, too much on the phones. Amen. It's is is everything everywhere. Amen. Everything is vying for your attention. Amen. All the distractions. Amen. See, so if you if you want to have that conference with God, that conversation with God that you're seeking for. Amen. Because every believer wants that wants that whirlwind in their lives. Amen. See, cuz Brother Bham said, if you believe and just to believe, then something wrong. Amen. It has to be a reason for you to believe. Amen. You have to have that experience to believe. Amen. See, so we're so so we've had the experience in our hearts. Amen. But but but Lord, see Moses Moses had the experience with God. Amen. But yet again, he still wanted to see him. Amen. See, see. So it's not wrong. Amen. You're not disgracing God if you say, "Lord, I want to see you, Lord." Amen. See, Lord, see, Lord, see, see, look, I've been in this message for a long time, Lord. I believe you for a long time. I've been doing everything in my power I can, Lord. But Lord, I want to see you. I want something in my life, something. Amen. Show me something, Lord. Amen. See, because I know who I'm believing to, Lord. I'm not doubting you. It's not doubt. Amen. Amen. It's more of a push. Amen. See, because more revelation brings more of a relationship. Amen. More relationship brings more revelation. See, it's a cycle. Amen. It's a wheel. Amen. See, we get we'll get into that later, too. It's a wheel in the middle of a wheel that keeps turning. Amen. Amen. See, and then uh uh in in conference with God, Brother Brennham says, "But think that God invited us. God invited you. Amen. See, cuz before the foundation of the world, amen, you were chosen. Amen. See, it wasn't it was it's not by by not not by not by power, not by might, by the spirit, sayeth the Lord. Amen. No man can call can call him Christ ex Jesus except except by the Holy Spirit. Amen. See, so it's not you anyway who did all this. Amen. Lord, you called me here. Amen. I didn't ask to be here. I didn't ask to be on this earth, Lord. But I'm here. Amen. and and out of and out of all these people in the world. Amen. Or all the religions of the world. Amen. Why why am I here tonight? Amen. Why are you here tonight? Amen. Out of out of everywhere you could have been. Amen. You can be sleeping right now, eating some food, doing anything else. Amen. But you're here tonight. Amen. See? Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. See, it says, "But think that God invited us." God invited you. See, brother Brandham says that Jesus is the one knocking on the door. Amen. See, but it's up to us to open the door. Amen. You see, remember that uh that painting he said he said um um why uh why the knob's on the wrong side. He said, "No, it's up to you to open the door." Amen. See, and and and and see see we're opening the door. Amen. See, because we we believe this message. Amen. See, uh we praying to God. Amen. Uh we we do good works because we love God. Amen. See, see, so we're doing the right things. Amen. See, and and and and uh uh uh brother Benham says that he says that, you know, um that God wants to give us the Holy Spirit more than we want it. Amen. So, he's right here. He said it's like water trying to go through a small pipe. Amen. The second you open up, it'll rush in. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. See, it says um in the conference with God, Brother Brenham says, "But think that God invited us. The God of heaven invited you and I see poor finite people poor and invited us to come and talk it to him and talk it over of eternal life. Amen. Though our sins be as scarlet, yet they shall be white like snow. See, and further on, brother Benham says, "And God calls for a conference, all these great rich things in the word of God." It makes us rich people to know that God has given us an invitation to come and talk it over with him before the time. Amen. See, so God wants to speak to you. Amen. See, and God speaks to you through through the five-fold ministry, as I was getting to later on, too. See, he speaks speaks to you through the five-fold ministry. Amen. He speaks to you through your life. Amen. He speaks to you through nature, through things that's going on in the politics, in the world. Let you know what's going on in the world. He's speaking to you. Amen. Amen. And you have to be spiritual to pick it up. Amen. See, look. See, uh uh it took See everything going on in the world, everything going on when when Elijah was praying. Amen. diligently praying. Amen. But but he he he he he listened for that sweet silent voice. Amen. See, came like a small little wind. See, small. Amen. See, but everything else going on in the world, all the distractions. Amen. But you have but God has a people tonight who's praying. Amen. Diligently trying to hear that voice. Amen. Amen. And um and you see, because we're all striving for life. Amen. See, anything see uh brother Benham says uh I was going to mention this later but I'll say it now. Brother Benham said uh at one moment everything that has life &gt;&gt; it's a struggle. Amen. See so life is not going to be easy. Amen. See brother say if you're looking for something easy you're not going to find it. Amen. See so you can try to live in the world. They got their struggles too. Amen. But but how why not struggle knowing you got someone backing you up? Amen. See why why not why not choose that? Amen. Why why not strive for that which is not perish? Amen. But why let's not work for the things that do perish. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And see and in this quote you know brother Ben Brandom says all these great rich things in the word of God. Amen. See, when we think of riches in the scriptures, Amen, you have to remember, brother Brandham told us that types faith. Amen. So, all this great faith in the scriptures that's waiting for you. Amen. All these great revelations in the scriptures scriptures is waiting for you. Amen. See, and all you have to do is just you need that that tutor. You need that inside teacher to reveal it unto you. Amen. Because later on, brother Benham talks about the woman who has all the checks and the the nice lovely pictures. Amen. This Bible is nice. It's lovely. Amen. See, because see, we see especially I was speaking with another brother. You know, it's it's beautiful. You you talk to brothers and and you know, you be meditating on something and the Lord will bring it up in the conversation and this Lord give you confirmation that you're that that you're uh that you're meditating on the right things. Amen. See, I was talking speaking to a brother here recently, and we were just talking about how, you know, we we were raised up in the message. Amen. We we know our Bible. Amen. It it's not it wasn't it wasn't um a a work. Amen. To know all these revelations in the scriptures, all um our Bible as well as we do. Amen. Because we were raised up in the way, trained in the way we should go. Amen. The Lord gave us good parents. Amen. He he set those before us. Amen. That that that made path paved the way for us. Amen. See, so it made it easier. Amen. &gt;&gt; And and in that, Satan will try to distract you and he'll try to say, "Well, I mean, see, see, you don't really got revelation because it just it was just given to you." Amen. You you really got it. Amen. See, but that's that's the trick of Satan. Amen. Be because to begin with, the Lord put me in this feeling. So, the Lord knew I would need it. Amen. He just gave it to me a little sooner. That's all. Amen. Amen. See, I I I didn't have to work so hard for it. That's it. I thank the Lord for it. Amen. See? See? And um and and and uh so we were talking about that. Amen. And you see when um see cuz the issue is we have all this revelation. We have all we know our Bible as well as we do. Amen. But you need that supernatural element despite the revelation. Amen. See, that's what we want. Amen. See, that's why when you're in prayer, Amen, you're striving for that. Amen. Lord, I I want to touch something, Lord, in prayer, Lord. Like, so like like really I I want I want to I want to touch you, Lord. Amen. I I'll touch the heaven of your garment, Lord. That's what I want. Amen. Amen. Because I can know my Bible. Amen. But that's not that do me no good. Amen. If if I'm reading my Bible and I and I can't make it real real for my life. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; See u because that woman when she had those checks. Amen. See, she knew how to read. Amen. We know how to read. We we we know we know our Bible. Amen. See, I I I know I know what the check look like, but I want to cast a check. Amen. See uh see uh see uh but brother Benham said uh because we know that the letter killth the spirit giveth life. Amen. See, because she had the letters, but if she didn't have a have someone to show her what the letters really were saying, she would she was going to die. Amen. Because because she was poor. Amen. But she had all these riches riches in her, but but but she was looking at it, but she wasn't looking at it. Amen. See, see, that's why that's why Lord Lord, I I want to look at it, but I want to see it through your eyes, Lord. Amen. See, I want the real revelation that's in this. Amen. See, I I I just don't want to read the Bible to read it. I'm not reading just to read it. Amen. No, that's not why I'm doing it. No, I'm doing it because I I want I want you, Lord. I want eternal life. That's what I want, Lord. That's why I'm reading it. Amen. That's why I'm praying. That's why I'm listening to sermons and reading sermons. That's why I'm doing it. Amen. It's not It's not for vanity. No. Amen. And I'm not doing it just to do it. Amen. No. That's not how the bride works. Amen. See, and um and and see because she needed a guide to tell her what to do with it. Amen. Because see see riches type faith. Amen. See um is there a marker? Amen. &gt;&gt; See riches riches type faith. Amen. See that's a finances type. Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Amen. &gt;&gt; See, because that's what that's a that's a finances type in the scriptures. Amen. See, so we need Thank you, brother. So, so you see cuz she needed a guide. Amen. She needed someone to to decode that letter to her. Amen. See, and and see and the bride makes herself ready with that word. Amen. with the revelation, with inspiration of that word. Amen. Amen. See, because the desire is the supernatural substance that's in that word. Amen. That's what we want. Amen. We want the author. Amen. We we I just don't want the letter. I just I just don't want the I just don't want to uh know the book. Good. No, I want the author of the book. Amen. See, and and you know, and uh I was meditating on it. And you know, I love how the Lord worked with me because um math was math was always hard for me. You know, I I couldn't stand math. You know, my parents know I man me and math not a good mix. But but never nevertheless, I got a whole bunch of revelations through math. See, Lord Lord got a funny way of working, you know. I got whole bunch of revelations through math, you know. And um so right now the Lord has me taking a economics class. Amen. It's called microeconomics. And um it uses some math. Amen. And um I wanted to share something with y'all that the Lord put on my heart. &gt;&gt; Amen. So we know that this woman, she had she had finances. Amen. &gt;&gt; And in in economics, they have this thing called an an indifference curve map. Amen. &gt;&gt; See, and in this indifference curve map, &gt;&gt; you have two goods. Amen. &gt;&gt; And so you have good one here. And for this, I'm going to put Armenian here. Amen. It'll it'll make sense. It'll make sense. And then here, I'mma put Calvinistic here. &gt;&gt; See? And you see? &gt;&gt; Yep. Amen. And you see, and you see when we want to apply our faith to something when we're praying. Amen. You say, "Lord, I I want to know how to apply my faith correctly." Amen. See, because I'm trying to make an investment, Lord. Amen. See, because finances type because finances is faith. Amen. And I want to make the smart investment in what I'm trying to do, Lord. Amen. See, I don't want to put it all the way, put my faith in Calvinistic and go wrong. And I don't want to put my faith on many on many of them to go wrong, Lord. Amen. So, in this indifference curve map, what it's showing you is right here. This is what they call the budget line. Amen. See, so this is all of your finances right here. Amen. And one of the key principles in this is you're supposed to spend all your income. Amen. See, Lord, I want to spend all my faith, Lord. I want to put all my faith in the right in in the right area, Lord. That's what I want to do. Amen. See, and see, so this is the budget line. This is all all your income you have. Amen. And right here is the affordable range. Right here is the unaffordable range. Amen. But that don't apply to us. Amen. See, &gt;&gt; and this indifference curve, how it works is this is your indifference curve right here. on this indifference curve. This is saying everything every bundle on this curve &gt;&gt; is something that you're satisfied with. Amen. &gt;&gt; But however, the most optimal point on the indifference curve is where your where where your difference curve, which is your um which is what you like, meets perfectly meets perfectly with your budget. Amen. Right here in the middle. &gt;&gt; Right here in the middle. Amen. See right there. Amen. Amen. See, and when I saw it, I said, "Wow, Lord." I said, "See, if I put it all up here, it's too close to the Calvinistic. I put it off here too much, Lord." But Lord, I want to put it right in the middle. All my money right here. That's why I want to spend it right here. All my faith, I want to spend it right there. Amen. Amen. And and also when you um and when they go when they teach you uh later on we we we all we all know what what a a demand line is. Amen. See uh supply and demand. Amen. See, so this is the math behind behind your demand curve. Amen. See, because your demand curve looks like this. Amen. It just goes just like that. Just like that. See, and what it's saying, this this is your goods right here. &gt;&gt; This is what you want to get. But this is how much it costs right here. And what it's saying is the more expensive it is, the less of it you want. &gt;&gt; But when I was looking at it, when I was looking at it for a believer, the more faith it requires, the more I want it. &gt;&gt; Amen. See, so this is flipped for me. This ain't the same way. Amen. See, I was like, right. I said, Lord, I said, so you showing me this. This is showing me how much faith I got. Amen. See, because the more expensive it is, my life go like this. They go it go this way. See, that's how a believer works. Amen. Amen. You know, it's a man. When I saw I was It's a beautiful thing. Amen. You got You got to see God in everything. Amen. Amen. See, because because see and you can't expect to be understood by the world. Amen. Because just like the scriptures tells us, wherever the wind bloweth, that's where we go. Amen. See, so so we don't abide by uh we give into Caesar with seeds, but we're given to God what is God's. Amen. See, so if Caesar is going against God, we go with God. Amen. Amen. See, because uh because they told the apostles, "Stop preaching." They said, "Well, we going to keep preaching because God told us to preach." Amen. Amen. See? Amen. And and um and because because um you know uh in John 3:27, it says, "A man can receive nothing except it be given to him from heaven." Amen. See, so whatever is on your heart and whatever the Lord puts on your heart &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; on this indifference curve to want is yours. &gt;&gt; Amen. See, because &gt;&gt; I didn't ask for it, it just hit for some reason I was going about my life and it hit my heart. Lord, it's what I want in my life. Well, you gave it to me, Lord. So, so later on, no matter what, how no matter how much faith it caused, Amen. Well, you're telling me, Lord, I can do it. Amen. See, because because faith faith is the is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things unseen. Amen. See, so so no matter no matter the measure, a a faith the size of a piece of grain can move a mountain, Lord. So this is nothing. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So um Amen. And uh another thing that pricked my heart, you know, when I was meditating on this, you know, uh uh brother Brandham says, "And let your light soul shine before men." He says, "Now, no matter how much I can reflect it here, &gt;&gt; unless it reflects on you too, we'll never understand it." Amen. See, so no matter how much revelation brother Brandham got, &gt;&gt; unless I don't got it, it don't do me no good. So I want that, too. I want the same revelation brother Brandham got. Amen. What did Elijah say? Where's the God where's the God of Elijah? Amen. See, where's the God of your prophet, Lord? That's how who I want to meet. That's the whirlwind I want to see when I pray, Lord, in my life, Lord. Amen. See, see, in my home, I want those angels in my home. Amen. That that's what I want to see. Amen. Amen. See, it says, it says, um, it says the gospel would be in none effect unless somebody was there to take it. Amen. See, there there will be many people who won't take it, but the ones that take it, it'll reflect in them. Amen. See, it says, and and this is what hit me right here. Brother Brennham says right after this, he says, you may never see a vision. You may never put your hands on a sick person and feel the charge of the almighty God make a skeleton of a man turn back to life again. You may never see him standing yonder through three or four rainbows. You may never see his image. You may never hear his voice, but you can still be a signpost. I'll reflect Jesus Christ by a life that's been so pure and unadulterated from the world. Amen. See, it says not smuted up with dirty things around your life, but pure. And then it cuts off and says that'll that'll that it'll cause the hungry heart to hunger and thirst to be like you. Amen. See? Amen. See, so Lord, I want to see that whirlwind, Lord. But whatever your will be, let it be done. Amen. See? See, because I still know who I believe. Amen. I still know who I'm believing. I still know this message is true. It's been vindicated too much to be wrong. Amen. I be a fool to turn away from it. Amen. Amen. See, cuz where else is there to go? Where else is there to turn to? Amen. There's no nothing else can I can I bank my faith on. Amen. No other investment I can put myself in. Amen. See because because I I've seen it turned out good each and every time I paint I put I bank my faith on it. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And um now I want to continue. Um and now that was a a sidebar the Lord told me to go through. So I want to get into the meat of what uh the Lord put on my heart. Amen. &gt;&gt; So out of all this, Amen. This this all this was packaged in the Lord presenting himself. Amen. All this was packaged in that fourth verse. Amen. And then why was all this so important? What was he trying to show &gt;&gt; in verse five of Ezekiel 1 vers5? &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; It says, "Also, &gt;&gt; yes sir. &gt;&gt; Also, &gt;&gt; also &gt;&gt; out of the midst thereof came the likeness of four living creatures. And this was their appearance. &gt;&gt; They had the likeness of a man. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I want And brother Brim talks about this. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; He says in Revelations 4 number three. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; He says and here in Revelations 4, it means a living creature, not a beast, &gt;&gt; but it's called beast. &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. &gt;&gt; But it isn't. So this is that whirlwind right here. This is that revelation that's revealing. Amen. This is what it's saying. This is what it really means. Amen. He says same thing in Ezekiel 18, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; 1-28. See, so the whole chapter says may maybe get to it in a minute. Now it isn't. So if you want to read it now, we haven't got time. I was going to read it, but I haven't. Says put down Revelations 11:13 and 17. Now where oh now there where beast is the chapters in revelation 11:13 and 17 is called beast the same way but the beast there interpretation is t h e r io n theionon amen &gt;&gt; the word Greek word theionon which means a wild untamed beast &gt;&gt; theionon that means a wild untamed beast &gt;&gt; but zoom so he's saying here it's saying it's zoom that's the interpretation amen so zoom means a creature. See, four living Zoom creatures. Amen. Not beasts of wild Theion, &gt;&gt; but Zoom living creatures. See? Amen. See, I'm going to use the board a little bit today. Amen. So, &gt;&gt; Amen. So, we see. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; In Revelations 4 and Ezekiel 1. &gt;&gt; Yes, my brother. &gt;&gt; This is Zoom. &gt;&gt; That's exactly. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, my brother. &gt;&gt; So, Revelations 4. Uh-huh. &gt;&gt; Revelations 4. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And Ezekiel 1. &gt;&gt; Yes, my brother. &gt;&gt; This is Zoom. Living creature. &gt;&gt; That's exactly right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This is the living creature. &gt;&gt; That's what it says. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And so it says zoom. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And but this is not beast. &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; As the way we interpret it. &gt;&gt; That's Revelations 11. &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. &gt;&gt; Yep. 13 17 and put six. Amen. Cuz what beast was there? What four beasts was there? Revelation the six. Amen. See, we know that that by revelation was the the four horse riders was the church. Amen. And brother Brennham says later on he says they were untamed to the gospel. Amen. See. &gt;&gt; Amen. So this is Theion. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; This is Theion, a wild and untamed. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; To the gospel. &gt;&gt; That's exactly right. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But this creature, what does this what does that mean? This creature is then. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And then I'm sorry, I got to I didn't finish. So this is the denominal church. &gt;&gt; That's exactly right. &gt;&gt; That's what it is. &gt;&gt; It's the nominal &gt;&gt; anointing. Anointing. Amen. Amen. The nominal church anointing. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Which is untamed to the gospel. Amen. &gt;&gt; What gospel? Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. The true gospel. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. See. &gt;&gt; Amen. And we see &gt;&gt; brother Benham continues in Revelations 4 number two. &gt;&gt; He says, "What is it?" Talking about these creatures. Amen. &gt;&gt; He says, "What is it?" &gt;&gt; The living creatures represent the living church. The church that's a living by the power of the revelation resurrection of Christ. &gt;&gt; Look look cuz it says also out of the mist came out the four beast. Amen. See what comes out of the pillar of fire. Amen. Amen. Amen. It says it says he says them same amber colors has covered it from the loins upwards. Amen. See that's the pillar of fire but the same anointing is on you. Amen. That same anointing is on his church. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, and these are the the the the four guards. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's exactly right. &gt;&gt; That's what they are. Amen. They're the living church. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; The living church. Amen. Not a dead, cold, formal church. A living church. Amen. &gt;&gt; And they're clothed with that pillar of fire. &gt;&gt; Clothed with the fire. Amen. &gt;&gt; Uh-huh. It says &gt;&gt; they're clothed with the fire. Amen. That's the same Holy Ghost. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's the same Holy Ghost. That's what it is. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The same anointing. &gt;&gt; The same power. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And then &gt;&gt; we continue and uh and we continue. It says in 2 Corinthians 5:17, it says, "Therefore, if if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature." Amen. Old things are passed away. Amen. All things become new. Amen. See, so that pillar of fire in verse 4 that came down, Amen. That's the same pillar of fire that was anointing his church. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And um and let's go to Ezekiel 1:12-16. So, same book. Let's drop down a couple verses. &gt;&gt; Yes, &gt;&gt; we in there. Say, "Amen." Amen. &gt;&gt; All right. It says, "And they went, everyone straight forward, &gt;&gt; whether the spirit was to go, they went &gt;&gt; and they turned not when they went." Amen. &gt;&gt; As for the likeness of the living creatures, their appearance was like coals of burning fire. Amen. &gt;&gt; And like the appearance of lamps, lamps is the spirit of God. Amen. The seven spirits of God, the seven lamps. Amen. See, so it's a lamp, the spirit of God. Amen. It went up. It went see it went up and down. See, because this says the burning coals of fire and alike. Amen. See, so the coes of fire is is she's telling you, he's telling you that there is a fire around them. Amen. See, that's that that's the same anointing of the pillar of fire. Amen. And they went up and down among the living creatures. And the fire was bright and out of the fire went forth lightning. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And the living creatures ran and returned as a prince with a flash of lightning. Amen. I Amen. Amen. I'm get I'm getting that later on. Amen. It says, "As I be as I beheld the living creatures, behold, one will upon the earth by the living creatures with his four faces." &gt;&gt; The appearance of the wills and their work was like unto the color of a burrow. And the four had one and the four had one likeness. And their appearance in their work was as it were a wheel in the middle of a wheel. Amen. Amen. See, and brother Brandham says exactly on this. Amen. I'm I'm let the prophet speak on this. He says, "What is the symbol here, &gt;&gt; brother Brandham?" So, we're asking him. He says, "Brother Brandham, we're asking brother Brandham, what is this?" Amen. What is it? &gt;&gt; He says, "It means that these guards was God's ark." Amen. See, they were in journey rolling on wheels when Ezekiel saw them. Amen. See, and we know what ark. Amen. That's the church. Amen. Cuz the ark is the altar. Amen. And the altar is the church. Amen. See, so these guards is God's church. Amen. See, they were in journey rolling on wheels when Ezekiel saw them in the Old Testament. Amen. &gt;&gt; Church was still moved. Church agency was still going on. Amen. It says, "But when John saw them, they had already come in the right position in heaven." Amen. See, the ark of God was on earth rolling on wheels. As they took it from place to place, meant it was in travel. They took it all the way up through the wilderness and all the way to all the way into the temple. So forth. And he continues. He says, "But now it's it's received up because the church age is over." Amen. See, it's received up into glory. It's stationary now in heaven. Amen. See, where is this church now? In heavenly places. We're stationary now. Amen. We're grounded in the faith. Amen. Look, all mysteries are over with. Amen. See, we're grounded. Amen. In heavenly places because we're in our position. Brother Bam said, "We're in in your position. You're in heavenly places." Amen. That's where we are. Amen. See, so that's that's this is what Ezekiel was seeing right here. The church positioned a job was seeing the church position. Amen. And he says it says um he says with with the angels and things all around it. See cuz the angels angels accomp those who fear him. Amen. See it says we find them after a while taking off their crowns and their faces and giving glory to him. See it was God's guard of the temple, the ark. Now remember God's guard of the ark or the mercy seat. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; See, so we have we have the living church. Amen. The same Holy Ghost, same cloth, the same pillar of fire, and they're on earth. &gt;&gt; They're on earth when Ezekiel sees them. Amen. And it's the ark. Amen. &gt;&gt; And we know the ark is the church. Amen. This is how I think through things just like that. Amen. And then the church is alter. Amen. And I and brother Benham says, I'll show you. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because brother Benham says in Revelations 4 number three, he says four is God's number of deliverance. &gt;&gt; It showed that these beings must have been I'm sorry. It showed that these beings must have been something about the earth. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. It says and in the ark in uh 1955, brother Benham says and the church his ark today. Amen. &gt;&gt; Coming into his church which is no more than his own see his church which is no more than his own spiritual body here on earth. Amen. See we make the body of Christ. Amen. See, he says, "The ark is built as the church." The ark was the church. He says, "And I said, "Oh, I see a God is built out of believers." Amen. See, now we're going to continue in Ezekiel 1, we're going to drop back 6-7. It says, "And everyone had four faces, &gt;&gt; and everyone had four wings." Amen. &gt;&gt; So, Amen. This is And the feet were straight feet, and the soles of their feet was like the soles of a calf's foot, &gt;&gt; and they sparkled like the color of burnished brass. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, Amen. Now, the feet were straight. Amen. &gt;&gt; Straight walk. Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Going forward, not turning back. Not Not going to left or the right. Amen. Staying in the middle of the road. Amen. Amen. Putting our ve investments right in the middle of the road. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. It says, "And the souls of their feet was as a calf's foot." See, a calf is a beast of sacrifice. Amen. We're a living sacrifice unto God. We offer ourselves as living sacrifice unto God. Amen. Because this is God's church, right? And that's what he said, right? Amen. See, he says, "Shouls of the cast." Amen. See, and they sparkle like the color of burnished brass. Amen. See uh the the calf is beast of sacrifice and the sacrifice is possession as if that was their feet. Our our possession only possession only possession we have is our life. Amen. And it's giving that possession to the one that's taking his life. Amen. Because if you keep your life you lose it. If you lose your life you'll keep it. Amen. See if you give your life to Christ as living sacrifice. Amen. See and it says and it says as a color of burnished brass. What is burnished brass? We know what brass is, but what is burnished brass? See, burnished brished brass is when the brass goes through a process of being polished. Amen. And and it appears and and it goes from brass being divinely judged to golden. Amen. See, it turns the brass to gold. Amen. Come on. Amen. See? See? It turns it into gold. Amen. See, because it it it see because once you die on the cross, Amen. Once you die on the cross, like cross once you die like Jesus died. Amen. Die to yourself. Amen. See, see it. You You die to the first husband and you and and you you and you're able to live with the second husband. Amen. See, because it's reveals the deity that's in you. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, now because the straight because the feet were straight. Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; It's a straight. It's a straight walk. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Straight walk. &gt;&gt; Amen. And &gt;&gt; and it was the cow's feet. Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Living a life of sacrifice. Brother Brendom said, "A Christian's life, a Christian's life is is living for others." Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, it's cast feet and it was birdish brass. It went through a process to become gold. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And really, it was always gold. Amen. Because then it because when it when it goes through that polishing process, never changes the nature. It never changes the molecules of of that object. It just reveals what's underneath it. Amen. That's all it does. Amen. &gt;&gt; It goes through a cleansing process. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And now, and now we're going to go to Revelations 4:8. I have it here so you don't have to flip to it. It says, "And the four beasts had each of them six wings about him &gt;&gt; and were full of eyes within." &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And they rest not day and night, saying, "Holy, holy, Lord God Almighty, which is which was and is and is to come." Amen. See, so it has wings and it has eyes. Amen. We know wings speaks of a prophet. Amen. We know eyes speaks of a a prophetic sight. Amen. So this is a double portion. Amen. See this is this is um the second oil. Amen. See. Amen. And it says they have six wings. Amen. They have six wings and full of eyes. They're full of eyes. They can't be caught off guard. &gt;&gt; Full of eyes. Amen. &gt;&gt; And why have wings to fly high but you can't see them where you at? Amen. See. Amen. Amen. Amen. And brother Brham says in Revelations 4 number three, he says, "And they flew and so forth and have eyes without, within, and behind." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; It spoke of their intelligence. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; They knew what was, which is, and which shall come. The Isachar, Amen. See, they had eyes. Amen. They could see which was, which is, is to come. They knew what to do in that time. Amen. See, see, they knew how to fly on on the wind. Amen. See, come on. Amen. See, it says, it says, it says, "And they was right at the seat." Amen. So close till they wasn't even human no more. Amen. See, when you're in Christ, you're a new creature in Christ. Amen. We're so close to it. We're not even human no more. Amen. See? Amen. It says, he says, "Tle guards." He says, "Or not temple guards." See? See? Temple guards, not temple guards. It's so close. Amen. See, he says the temple guards are 144,000. But this is the mercy seat guards, the throne guards, the throne right up next to God. Amen. See living creatures next to God standing there. Their intelligence they knew what was which is and shall come. They had eyes without showing what they could see, what was to come. Oh uh which know what was. Amen. Same God Jesus Christ same yesterday, today and forever. Amen. See and uh and continues. He says now at this I want to show you now and make this sure. It's an altar. Amen. He says it must have been an altar at the Garden of Eden. I'll tell you why. Do you remember both Cain and Abel come here to worship? So that show that God's altar was moved and set at the Garden of Eden. The only way back to Eden is by the altar. Here you go again. See back to Eden through the altar. And they were and and there and they were to keep that way there guarded. They couldn't go back to the altar was covered with blood. Amen. See the church covered with blood. You can't go back till you're covered with blood. Amen. See, and it says, it says, here's the true altar of God is in the heart of men. Amen. Then there's another altar down here representing the holies of holies in the holy place. Amen. See, and now, now we're going to turn a little bit. Amen. See, because in Ezekiel, in Ezekiel, &gt;&gt; they were on the earth. &gt;&gt; They're on the earth. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; But John, &gt;&gt; in heaven, in heavenly places, in the position. Amen. in heaven. &gt;&gt; In heaven. Amen. Amen. And um now I want to I want to I want to go through something. Amen. Now, but Lebrand says, "No, I go I I'll go like this first." Amen. Um I don't want to turn away from that. Amen. &gt;&gt; So, we know that these were temple guards. Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And we know in the Old Testament, &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. &gt;&gt; there were guards also. Guards of the tabernacle. Amen. &gt;&gt; Exactly. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, we know this what the tabernacle tabernacle look like. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, we had Al uh &gt;&gt; court the outer court. This is the um the brazen altar. &gt;&gt; The labor &gt;&gt; have the shoe bread, &gt;&gt; the candles. Seven. &gt;&gt; Amen. And we have the altar of incense. And this and this is fluid. This can be here too. Amen. &gt;&gt; And then we have &gt;&gt; the ark. Amen. So now, &gt;&gt; now &gt;&gt; here, &gt;&gt; yes, sir, &gt;&gt; was Judah. &gt;&gt; That's exactly right. &gt;&gt; The lion. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Here was Reuben. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The man. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Here. &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. &gt;&gt; We have Ephereim. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; The ox. &gt;&gt; That's exactly right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. &gt;&gt; And then here we have Dan the eagle. Amen. That's not right. &gt;&gt; Now, this was an Old Testament. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; See, we're living in a new age today. Amen. &gt;&gt; So, that means those still apply. That's not wrong. Amen. It never changes. Amen. God just adds to his revelation. Amen. See? &gt;&gt; So, brother Brennham says in Revelation chapter 4, number three, he says, now God has a mercy seat today to be guarded. Amen. Where is in the believer's heart. Amen. See, because the believer makes themselves ready by the Holy Ghost. So, how do we make ourselves ready today? Amen. See, see, that's how they made themselves ready back then. Amen. But now, today, how do we guard &gt;&gt; guard the mercy seat here? Make ourselves ready. Amen. For the coming of the Lord. Amen. Because the Lord says when he comes, will we find faith? Amen. See, so we need to guard that faith. Amen. What guards our faith today? Amen. See, and brother Brennham says, um, God has a mercy seat to be guarded. You believe that? Where is the mercy seat found? In the heart of man. &gt;&gt; Where did it come? Where did it come in the heart of man? At the day of Pentecost when the Holy Ghost which is the which is God come into human heart. See remember verse four God came down with the pill of fire. He came down with the cloud came out the whirlwind. So God came down already. Amen. See and it says it says now let's mark this down here. Get ready to draw it if you want to see Pentecost. I put Pentecost. This is the mercy seat. Holy Ghost put it here. I'll tell you what makes it more appropriate. Let's put it here. The dove. Amen. See so brother Benham is talking about this right here. Amen. Talking about this right here. Amen. So, it's the Holy Ghost cuz it has to be guarded. Amen. It's the the dove. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And the dove makes its own oil &gt;&gt; producing within itself. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And then and then which is the altar &gt;&gt; which is the church. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's all the same thing. Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And then but it's being guarded by who? In today and today. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Cuz God's the same yesterday, today, and forever. Amen. See, so it has to be present today as well. Amen. &gt;&gt; And and the mysteries are all done. So that means it's available to be to be sought after. Amen. See? Amen. And brother Brandham said, "Now remember, God's got some guards for that mercy seat." &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; What is that mercy seat guard? All right. &gt;&gt; M A T H. Matthew on the east. Amen. Oh, so he tells us where he's at. Amen. Amen. It's the same. That is taking forever. Amen. So, Brother Ben also already tells us Matthew was here, brother. &gt;&gt; Matthew is right here. That's where Matthew is. Amen. For today. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. He says he says Luke, Mark, and John. We don't know where he's at. Got to got to search for it. Amen. He he said he he don't give revelation to to a lazy man. Amen. You got to work for it. Amen. See, it says all of their four gospels vindicated the book of Acts to come. Amen. What was the book of Acts? The wax of the Holy Ghost and the church. Amen. See, it says they guarded anyone they want to look at it. Amen. See, and number in verse in uh same uh same message. Brother Bam says something's wrong here. Matthew, are that eastern? Are you that eastern guard? How is the gate? The gate is what? So, he's showing us what Matthew's protecting. He says the gate is what? Jesus. Jesus said, "Straight is the gate." Is that right? Is it spelled? How's it spelled? S T R A I T or S T R A I G H T. S T R A I T means water. Water is the gate. So he's guarding baptism. Amen. See, he said he he said he says unlocks the gate. Woo. Oh, but brother Brandon, you got Matthew 28:19 down there. But that's exactly right. But Matthew, are you a guard to it? Matthew responds. See, he says, "Sure, I'm the full guard." Amen. See he says and then he continues and brother Brandham says now let's go over here John 14:12 see if John so this is John now at where's John at amen so he's talking about John he's about to tell us where John is he says and see if John's going back up to guard the precious things of Pentecost in the 14th chapter in the 12th verse Jesus speaking he says verily verily I say unto you he that believeth on me and the works that I shall do he shall do also and greater works than these he shall do because I go to my father oh brother that gate here with the eagle sitting right here. Where's the eagle at? The eagle is where Dan is. Amen. See, he said he says because that's the evangelistic service. Oh, I'm getting that too. Amen. See, it's evangelical service. So the e so he says he says you know flying like an eagle swiftness go plumb down into the prophetic land up there. You see can foresee things and tell us what things is shall come sitting right there guarding it. The works the works that I do. Watch that eagle. See? Amen. See amen. So that eagle is John. Amen. So John is right here. &gt;&gt; Yes, my brother. &gt;&gt; And I'mma add something here. I'mma get to it later on. Ev evangelist. &gt;&gt; That's what he said. &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. &gt;&gt; That's what he said. &gt;&gt; That's what he said. &gt;&gt; I ain't say it. That's what he said. Amen. See, he said he says &gt;&gt; he says he says he continues. He said now he said he continues. Now he says that's when he cursed the tree. That's Matthew 21. Matthew No, I did Matthew. He said, "Pardon me, Mark 11:21." So Mark now, so it sounds like Mark is the spoken word. Amen. It says, "And Peter calling to remember to say unto him, Master, behold the fig tree you thou curses in the way." And Jesus answered, saying unto him, have faith in God. See, for verily I say unto you, whosoever shall say his mouth, be thou removed, and be thou cast to the sea, shall not doubt in his heart. believe that those things or which shall come come to pass. He that he shall have whatsoever he saith. And then right after he says is what his brother say. He says, "Boy, the south gates guarded by the ox." Amen. So who you talking about? Mark. Mark is here where the ox is. Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; That's Mark. Amen. And what is the ox? Ox is the pastor. &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; Ox is the pastor, right? Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. See, so you see what's happening, right? You see where it's coming to, right? Amen. Amen. See, it says it says um he says, oh, he says the north gate's guarded by the lion. The north gate. Oh, he said, oh, I mean the east gate. &gt;&gt; The north gate is guarded by the flying eagle. &gt;&gt; John the evangelist. Oh, he tell he's telling his right plane right there, sir. &gt;&gt; Then the physician this side, Luke the man. Amen. Oh, so Luke is here. &gt;&gt; Yes, my brother. &gt;&gt; And what goes with the physician? Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; He says, he says, um, brother Benham says, "Hear ye him." 1956. He says, "There stood Elijah." What do Elijah stand for? &gt;&gt; The lion of God's justice. &gt;&gt; Elijah was a stern prophet. So the lion, where the lion is, that's where prophet goes. Amen. Amen. I I have more quotes, too, to back it up. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. He says, he says in in 1957, God keeps his word. Brother Brenham says, "Let me tell you something. God has purposes for everything. Stay with the word. What the Bible says, stay with it. It's God's thumb. Amen. &gt;&gt; Old Micah the prophet stay with the word of God. Walk down there just as boldly as a lion. Amen. See, so it's still still there. Amen. It says the seventh seal. It says in the seventh seal, brother Benham says, now you just go back through the history and find out why exactly it will be contrary to the word. Exactly. When the first went forth, it was a lion that was prophet. That's what he said. Amen. In 1963 in the in the breach between the church ages and the seventh seal, brother Brennham says, "Now John looks on mission to write what he saw." We're on John now. He says he says, "So the apostle and prophet pick up his pen and write it." So Ben also told us evangelistic and um and apostle goes right next to goes right next to each goes right with each other too. &gt;&gt; Amen. He's a prophet too though. So that still has to go. Amen. Amen. Because brother Benham also showed us that the prophet can do all can can be in every one of these offices because he did it himself when he was on the scene. Amen. He saw prophet really can go every prophet can go everywhere around there. Amen. &gt;&gt; And then and then um and then in adoption and in the third seal, brother Brennham says John the Revelator, the prophet John was in the vision and saw it. Amen. So, just backing it up some more. Amen. &gt;&gt; In adoption number two, brother Benham says, I'd rather have an So, now we're getting to Luke now. &gt;&gt; He says, I'd rather have an old doctor that had went through that operation many times before before I went to be cut on. I want to know somebody not just out of school. I want somebody with some experience. &gt;&gt; And the best experienced one that I know to call on tonight is the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; He's God's great physician. Look what he says. Great teacher. Amen. So, &gt;&gt; so teacher goes here. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And then and then continue in uh first John 3 uh 3 and2. Amen. Let's go there. 1 John 3 and2. Amen. 1 John 3 and 2. Get there. Say amen. &gt;&gt; First John. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; 1 John 3:2. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He says, "Beloved, now we are the sons of God and does not yet appear what we shall be, but we know that when we shall appear, we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is." Amen. See, so in the preparation time, Amen. as we're preparing to meet Jesus. Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; We need guards. Amen. &gt;&gt; To prepare us along the way cuz we're prepared with the gospel. Amen. See, and then brother Benham also says that these four gospels were the uh uh Mark, uh uh John, Matthew, and Luke. They were they were the the guards of the gospel. That's what he says. Amen. See? Amen. Amen. So these go these four gospels. Amen. This faithful ministry. Amen. &gt;&gt; See this is what guards the church. Amen. And the preparation. Amen. To meet Jesus Christ. Amen. See, and we'll be like him. Amen. Just like him when we see him. Amen. Amen. See, because it's for the edification of the bride. Amen. To where every joint, every everything will be in order. Amen. When it's when we see him. Amen. Amen. See, because we're all striving for something. Amen. We're striving for life. Amen. See, and that's what we're all striving for. Amen. See, cuz brother Benham says, and and the world is falling apart. He says, "Our political world, man-made system and fashions, we want everything so we can take it easy and retire, take life easy." He says, "Life wasn't intended to be easy." Amen. Life is a struggle. Anything that's got life is a struggling. Look at the trees, how they struggle. Look at every everything that's got life. It's a struggle. When we try to go get some kind of a system that takes it easy, then we're wrong and we know there's something wrong. Amen. See? Amen. In uh 1950 in Moses, brother Benam says, "Well, that's the way I did this. I just took him at his word." Amen. And there I went and you just take him at his word tonight. If you and if you may be a sinner and do not understand how to take God at his word, and then God sent me here, Amen. I want you to take take for I want you to take my word for it. Jesus the prophet. Amen. Not me the prophet. Amen. See he says he says take my word for it. See if it doesn't come to pass and God will bless you. Amen. See because in 2 Chronicles 20:20 it says they rose early in the morning and went forth into the wilderness of Jakoa. Nothing went forth. Jehoshaphat stood and said, "Hear me, O Judah, and ye inhabitants of Jerusalem. Believe in the Lord your God, and so shall you be established. believe his prophets, so shall ye prosper. Amen. So this right here, this revelation was given by the prophet. Amen. See? See? So, so just believe if if if you can't see in the words, believe the prophet. Amen. See, believe what he said because he's vindicated by the word. Amen. So, you may not see it now, but you'll see it by and by. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And he says, he said, brother Benham says, he says, men are afraid to speak. &gt;&gt; They're afraid to take a stand. They have to have something behind them to back them up. some great denomination or organization or something they some great band what God called men needs is the Holy Spirit behind him to back them up amen see you stand alone today we won't do it we stand as organization we stand as a move stand this or that or the other amen but says but God wants men to be individuals like Elijah was he was the only one left so far as he knew it but he stood for the right principles noise and shakings didn't bother him he waited till he heard that still small voice and he answered and how do you hear that still small voice today. Amen. See, God sent God sent you a five-fold ministry. Amen. To to build you up. Amen. To teach you how to pray. Amen. Amen. How to approach God. Amen. See See See how to get in the spirit. Amen. How to do these things. Amen. So you can meet God for yourself. Amen. See, because all I'm here to do is to point you towards Christ. Amen. That's all I'm here for. I'm here to do nothing else but that. Amen. See, so the very point of this is to show you the importance of the five-fold ministry. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. See, because you need, you can't go without it. Amen. That's like, that's like going to war, that's like going to war without a helmet on. Amen. You're going to get hit in the head. Amen. It's not going to work. Amen. Amen. See, he said, he says, he says, uh, but we want some kind of backing up. A man thinks because he's a minister, if he don't go out to some great organization to get them to back him up, well, he will not be able to preach. If God called you to preach, preach if you stand alone. Preach anyhow. God spoke to you. Stand out there and preach. It's your God-given right. Amen. See? Amen. Is my God-given right to share the revelation that God gave me. Amen. See, in 2 Timothy 2 3-4, the scriptures say, "Therefore, endure a hardness as a good soldier of Christ." Amen. No man that worth entangle himself with the affairs of this life that he may please him who have chose him to be a soldier because you didn't choose to be a a soldier of Christ. God chose you. Amen. See? Amen. Amen. So now and and he knew he'll receive him. That's why he chose you because your affections are towards Christ. Amen. See, because see if you look at it, there's struggles in your life. Amen. The the the scripture says uh out of the treasures of your heart come the issues of your life. Amen. See, so the issues in your life, what you struggle with on a daily basis. Amen. You always are trying to do something for Christ. Amen. You're always trying to see Christ do this right in your eyes. Amen. See, you're always trying to please Christ. Amen. See, so that shows who you are right there. Amen. See, cuz your affections are towards Christ. Amen. See, so don't let Satan come and come come with the mind battles and attack you with that. And as a matter of fact, if it's a mind battle, if two countries are fighting over a land, they want that land because the land has potential to to to to to um the land has potential. Amen. See, there's a lot of resources in it. Amen. The the land wants to they both want to fight over that land. If the greatest battle ever falls in your mind, that means that both parties want your mind. Amen. That means if saying wants your mind, God wants your mind too. Amen. See? Amen. So that mean because God because there's a potential. Amen. Because the mind is the spirit. Amen. See cuz what you daily put in your spirit drops down to your soul. Amen. See because see it has potential. Amen. Potential to to to to reap riches. Amen. To reap to to reap great faith out of it. Amen. See. And God wants that because Amen. Because when you get to a certain age, Amen. When you turn 13 years old, get to a certain age. Amen. You're turned on. Amen. So now both parties are firing as hard as they can to get you. Amen. See? Amen. See it says and in verse 19 it says, "Nevertheless, the foundation of God standeth sure." Amen. Having this seal. Amen. The Lord knoweth them that are his. Amen. And everyone that nameeth the name of Christ depart from iniquity. Amen. See, God knows who's who's his children. Amen. See? Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm I'm about to close. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. It says in uh questions and answers 1961 there's a question it says is it possible for a holy ghostfilled person to be driven by thee to do minor things and fluent to do minor things that he doesn't want to do but the benom responds he says oh yes exclamation mark yes sir yeah a holy ghostfilled person you're right in you're right in the place then to be drove by these things amen see so don't count it strange when the things come upon you amen see it says see because once you've built up by the five-fold ministry. Amen. Once you've been stable, the foundation is sure. Amen. You have the seal. Amen. See, you know who you are. Amen. It's been revealed onto you who you are. Amen. See, once it's made sure, that's when the battle starts. Amen. See, you thought you had a fight when you're trying to attain it. But now the real fight starts. Amen. See, he says, he says when you're there serving, when you're when you're down there serving the devil, he just let you slouch around any way you want to. But you once take a stand for Christ, you've got the other side. Then he changed every gun right around you. Every temptation, everything that can be thrown to you, then you got it. See, but what have you got? Greater is he that's in you than he that is in the world. Amen. Amen. And he continues, Amen. And then inident identification, brother Brandham says that's about the little bride now that has to take her stand. It looks dark. See the the light is pressing. It looks dark. Amen. See, the council of churches is going to throw you into that thing or you're going to have to take a stand and come out. Amen. You have to reflect your character. Amen. See, all this preparation was to build a character in you. Amen. See? Amen. Amen. And he says he says he says, "What's he going to do in that time?" What's going to happen when you can't buy or sell um when when they have the union of church? Now you say, "What happens?" No. No. See, now you say when that happens. No, you're looking to the future. No, it's now. Amen. See, he says, "Now you say when that happens." No. No. That flash has done took your picture then. Amen. See, your character has already told you. Amen. You're already in it. Amen. See, you know what the Bible said about that. They would come and say, "Yes, Lord, we're coming now." But it's too late. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God bless you, church. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. I um we'll pray before we before we close. Amen. You stand please. Father God, we come to you humbly, Lord God. We thank you, Father, for your grace, your love, your mercy. Father God, thank you, Father God, for the revelation, Father God, you gave your servant, Father God, to share unto your people, Lord God. Pray, Father God, that was received, Father God, as was put on my heart, Lord God. I pray, Father God, that is used, Father God, for the edification of your bride, Lord God. That's my only goal, Lord God, is to is point your bride towards you, Lord God. Jesus Christ, I'm just a mouthpiece. I'm just a microphone, Lord God. Father God, I thank you, Father God, for everything you've done, Father God. I thank you, Father God, for the children that, Father God, that you've that you've ordained to be here tonight, Father God, to hear this word, Lord God. Father God, I pray that they take it, Lord God, and and it be and and it be a revelation unto them, be a stone unto them, Father God, to you, Lord God. When that Goliath comes, Father God, when the Goliath of doubt, unbelief comes, they throw that stone at him, Lord God. Jesus Christ, we love you, Lord God. Thank you for everything you've done, Father. I pray, Father God, for the protection of them, of your children as they go on the highways and the bowways, Lord God, and throughout the week, Lord God. Oh God, in Jesus Christ's name we pray, Lord. Amen. [Applause] [Music] Praise God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Let's give the Lord a big clap. [Applause] You talking about digging in a message. If you if you have not read Revelation 4 1 2 3, you need to go back again. This is a big homework. Amen. Praise God. I don't know how he put it all together in one sermon because if I try to touch on this, this is a problem. Amen. Because there's so much revelation hidden into this. But you did a wonderful job. Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. In other word, all these things started since the Old Testament and they went through the seven churches and the five-fold ministry are right there. We got the teacher over here. We got a pastor over here. We got a there normally an eagle. Brother Brandham say it's a prophet. But in revelation, brother Brandham said the eagle also is an evangelist. &gt;&gt; Amen. So that's why you will understand why God told brother Brandham to do the work of an evangelist because a prophet can move on into those two area. Amen. &gt;&gt; But if you wonder where is the apostle, apostle is somebody who set things in order. &gt;&gt; When the lion roars, everybody shut down and sit down right there correctly and sit down. And brother Brandham when he's referring to the prophet in the lion, brother Brandham specifically talk about Paul which was an apostle. So your lion right there is talking about an apostle setting things in order. You got over there your ego and you got all five ministry that are working and brother Brandham say they addressing the bride. The five four ministry are addressing the bride. That's why we believe in the five ministry. That's why we invite our brothers and sister to come and preach so that we won't be ourself but we have that five-fold ministry moving in and it's working and preparing the bride left and right. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And I love when he says in Ezekiel that also out of the same thing came out the four uh living creature and brother Brandham tapped them also as the church because out of Adam came Eve. So we are coming from the same thing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. And when he say brass burnish uh brass look like gold. I didn't understand when I was looking for golden stuff for back there and they call it brass brass. And I say wait a minute brass is a different color. Then later on I learned that burnish brass look like gold. And when you look, you will see exactly look like gold. And the feet look like burnish brass. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. What a digging. I'm so proud of you digging so tight. Some of you might be lost a little bit. Go back home, take Revelation 4 part one, part two, part three and begin to listen to those sermon. You will begin to see everything clarify and clear where brother Ram goes into the detail. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's amazing and a miracle for a young man like this to touch the book of Ezekiel and the book of Revelation and put your head into it. Denomination are running away from it. But because of the message, &gt;&gt; we have the prophetic insight where we can dive into it and get into it and come out of it. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; So these things can be applied in many ways. Amen. But you when you talking about the seven church ages themsel then you can get the four anointing and separate them together. And the last one will be the ego for the seven church ages. But all four is the number of deliverance the number of the earth. They work with the believer. So when you take all four of them you put them together they got the seven church ages together. Amen. The lion work with Paul and then the ox work through the dark ages. Then the man pick up with Luther and Wesley and Pentecost. Then the flying eagle that's where we are. You put them together that those four anointing are making the bride of Jesus Christ from the beginning all the way to the end. So the four of them are the church but specifically for this age of laia the anointing that is really working on us it is the ego. Not just an eagle, a flying eagle. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Can a lion fly? &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; Can a man fly? &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; Can an ox fly? No. &gt;&gt; Can an eagle fly? Why is the ego at the last stage when the rapture need to take place? Because the eagle is telling you there is a type of people that will be taking a flight. Amen. Amen. So when you see the squeeze, just know the third pull will be right there. And the third pull is in the bride because brother I'm vindicated that I know the third pull is right here. &gt;&gt; Amen. So when you're going through your wind, through your trial, through your difficulty, saw the right thing so that you can get the whirlwind. Not a bad whirlwind, but we want the whirlwind of God where God can be closer to you and speak lip to ear to you. Amen. Let's pray. Heavenly Father, Lord, we are approaching you humbly tonight. Father, thanking you for your grace, your love, your mercy, and for such a miracle to see a young man that could be Lord, Father, talking about any type of things, talking about new gadget that are coming on the market, talking about what is going on on social media, posting things left and right and trying to see the things of the world. But Lord Father, this is a different caliber alto together. A young man that is really deep into the message. Showing Lord Father the diligency of standing and studying the message Lord and trying to get the mind of Christ and looking for the God of Elijah, the God of Brother Brham to be manifested in his life. Father, what a desire for a young man, Lord. Father, I pray that Lord, Father, this not stop at him, but every young man, Lord, Father, in this church will be affected by the same thing. Lord, may this not be a night that we come and watch a man, Lord, but may we see the supernatural working in the heart of a young man trying to tell us that if God can do it for one, they got to be more also that God can work through them, Lord. Father, we saw you working through the young man singing and we saw you working through another one preaching and we pray Lord. Father, we see the young man in technician that we see the young man working over there in the sound booth and all of that is the working of the Holy Spirit and we want to appreciate you father. I pray that you strengthen him Lord and may you help us Lord who are adult to always keep up a good example before them because another generation is coming Lord and they are zeroing in straight with the word of God. May you give us travel mercy Lord. Father if time terry again Lord may we meet again to fellowship about the things of the kingdom. Lord Jesus Christ I pray may the Holy Spirit take what was preached and presented tonight Lord. Father, may you minister to your children. May you give more revelation, Lord. Father, may you uh uh stir up a thirst in the heart of your children, those that are not deep in the message so that they can go back and do their homework. Lord, protect us and bless us. We also commit, Lord, father, the oncoming young sisters meeting unto their hand. Lord, protect us and bless us, Lord, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. Go ahead, brother S.
