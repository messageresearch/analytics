[17:10] we want to report that sister jean
[17:14] is a combo right she's doing better
[17:17] she's been in the hospital for her heart
[17:20] okay and as far as i'm gathering from
[17:22] the information
[17:24] i guess she had fluid on the lungs
[17:25] that's gone
[17:27] um the you know she's
[17:30] she's breathing well um so it's it's an
[17:33] improvement we do want to add her to our
[17:36] prayer list when we get there
[17:37] but she is improving amen
[17:41] so we need to give god glory for that
[17:43] and just ask him to continue to bless
[17:45] amen
[17:46] praise the lord hallelujah
[17:53] brother maurice's mother is home
[17:56] amen that's good as well hallelujah
[18:01] hey man and brother greg has been

[18:06] um brother danny from the philippines
[18:08] his wife um
[18:09] sister isabe isabelle um help me out
[18:14] here brother
[18:15] i'm that's right it was
[18:19] ovaries yes and they
[18:22] were everybody was recommending surgery
[18:24] all the doctors that had seen her
[18:26] and they i think she showed up for the
[18:27] procedure is that right
[18:29] and they took one more lurk and they
[18:30] look and they said there's no reason
[18:32] that
[18:33] it's not there amen hallelujah
[18:39] so god is working he's working in our
[18:42] midst
[18:44] now we sang as we sang a little bit here
[18:46] about feeling better
[18:48] i feel better since i've laid my well a
[18:51] physical infirmity is a burden
[18:54] lay it down this morning amen
[18:57] one of the other songs said that we're
[19:00] free now
[19:01] we're free from those burdens
[19:04] we're climbing higher each day and we
[19:06] say goodbye to the sin and the things
[19:08] that confound
[19:10] so i'm not doubting anybody here
[19:13] does not have the holy ghost but i'm
[19:16] looking for a fresh experience every
[19:18] time we meet
[19:20] and usually he meets it right he's an
[19:23] on-time god and he meets it
[19:27] so anybody else have a
[19:30] praise report about anything before we
[19:33] go into the prayer request
[19:35] yes sir brother robert
[19:43] amen praise the lord amen
[19:49] hallelujah hallelujah
[19:52] anyone else before we move into the
[19:54] prayer request
[19:55] yes ma'am
[19:58] okay
[20:02] great i did hear brother daley say that
[20:04] that's good
[20:06] we'll keep him on the prayer list as
[20:08] well amen praise the lord
[20:10] um let's remember as we go into the
[20:13] prayer requests let's remember brother
[20:15] nikki charnick again he
[20:16] he sends a daily devotion and he had not
[20:19] done
[20:20] it for a few days and when he came back
[20:22] it's
[20:23] i think it's starting to sink in a
[20:24] little bit with him and he's and he's
[20:27] he's um it's it was a very emotional
[20:30] 15 minute um devotion that he
[20:34] that he shared with us um
[20:37] i don't know i don't know if there were
[20:38] any other siblings beside his sister
[20:40] that was taken in the accident
[20:42] um i don't know does anybody else know
[20:47] yeah those those were taken but i don't
[20:49] know if he has a a surviving sister that
[20:51] was her brother
[20:52] because he's yeah because his dad you
[20:55] know his dad surviving that and that
[20:58] um so his work's not finished let's
[21:00] remember the family
[21:02] amen and let's um but it was just very
[21:04] emotional
[21:05] it was a little bit heartbreaking you
[21:07] know um what he sent
[21:08] and uh very very desperate
[21:12] so let's remember the charnock family
[21:14] let's remember sister jean
[21:16] and and your family your family
[21:20] sister divine
[21:42] um
[21:50] [Music]
[21:56] wow
[22:10] uh
[22:14] well we probably believe that the god
[22:16] knows who she is
[22:19] amen and sure he can just to prove that
[22:23] everybody's word wrong because his is
[22:24] the only word that's right
[22:26] amen and there's no there's no request
[22:29] too big for him
[22:30] you know there's nothing too big he
[22:31] likes the big ones
[22:33] because because it just glorifies him
[22:35] more
[22:37] um so let's remember um jermaine still
[22:40] amen does anybody have any more prayer
[22:43] requests that they'd like to speak out
[22:45] before
[22:46] [Music]
[22:48] brother elijah do you mind coming up and
[22:49] praying over these
[22:51] let's remember each other there's still
[22:54] a lot of scary things going on
[22:55] you know and we want to keep each other
[22:58] strong
[23:00] in the faith in the word in fellowship
[23:03] and in love most of all amen
[23:07] and uh i get excited when i get to come
[23:09] over here because i get to see everybody
[23:12] and it just thrills my heart um to just

[35:56] heard sermon 45 minute that stop to
[35:58] speak about the third pool
[36:00] after 20 years we don't even know what
[36:02] it means
[36:03] amen we don't want to do that again
[36:07] let's take our time dig dig dig until
[36:10] the coming of the lord amen
[36:13] i watched brother kelly on wednesday he
[36:16] was preaching he started his subject and
[36:18] he
[36:18] took off his subject and began to go
[36:21] into a
[36:22] different channel and maybe you were
[36:25] there you say wait
[36:26] a minute he said he's going to preach
[36:27] about this but why
[36:29] is he going this direction you need to
[36:31] be spiritual
[36:33] there was a lady that came that was
[36:34] sitting back there in pence
[36:38] that lady came she lives in texas
[36:41] she came in here she's a trainer to
[36:44] transform people down in gastonia
[36:47] and she was living in this hotel here
[36:50] and she came downstairs and attended the
[36:53] service
[36:54] and at the end of the services she
[36:56] requested if we know a message church
[36:59] in texas how she can attend it
[37:02] amen you see what happened
[37:05] so it was not brother kelly was the lord
[37:07] deviating by the kelly
[37:10] so that he can catch a soul for the
[37:13] kingdom of the lord
[37:15] amen let's not give the lord a big club
[37:18] for him
[37:20] amen you need to be sensitive to the
[37:25] holy spirit
[37:27] joshua chapter 10
[37:31] if you dare you can say amen
[37:33] [Music]
[37:34] if you look above chapter 10 you have
[37:37] chapter 9 verse 27 everybody see that
[37:41] okay let me just read that so we start
[37:43] chapter 10
[37:45] verse 27 of chapter 9 which is the last
[37:48] verse of
[37:49] the uh ninth chapter before you start
[37:52] verse 10
[37:53] or chapter 10. the bible say and joshua
[37:56] made them he's speaking about the
[37:58] gibeona
[37:59] they deceived joshua because they were
[38:01] afraid
[38:02] and because of that the children of
[38:05] israel made a covenant
[38:07] with them and there was no way to
[38:10] destroy them
[38:12] so that was one of them that escaped
[38:15] amen
[38:16] if you read in another chapter you'll
[38:18] find out that the
[38:19] bible the lord says that among all
[38:22] the people of the land of canaan
[38:26] the only people that made peace with
[38:28] israel
[38:29] was the gibeonite and the bible says
[38:32] that
[38:32] all the other one god let them recruit
[38:36] themselves
[38:37] pack themselves to come against israel
[38:41] so that the lord can destroy them
[38:44] so when somebody is packing gathering
[38:47] against you don't even worry it is the
[38:50] lord putting them together
[38:52] so he can deal with them one time amen
[38:56] so this is the only one that escaped but
[38:59] when they escape
[39:00] joshua i signed them to a special task
[39:04] in israel amen
[39:08] verse 27 and joshua made them
[39:11] that day viewers of wood
[39:14] they were working with wood praise the
[39:16] name of the lord
[39:17] and joys of water for the congregation
[39:22] so they became worker in the
[39:23] congregation
[39:25] they were gibeonide gentile
[39:28] outside but they got through israel
[39:32] almost like jacob getting the blessing
[39:35] by deception and for some reason when
[39:38] they enter in
[39:39] god assigned them a task to the
[39:42] congregation
[39:43] and the tabernacle
[39:49] for the congregation and for the altar
[39:51] of the lord
[39:53] even to this day in the place which
[39:56] he should choose
[39:59] chapter 10 now when all the other people
[40:03] heard that
[40:04] the city of gibeon which is a big city
[40:08] took a peace or may the peace with
[40:10] israel
[40:12] they got upset so they packed together
[40:15] to attack gibeon and to destroy him
[40:18] in other words you became friend with
[40:20] israel we're going to wipe you up
[40:23] verse 4 came up to me
[40:28] verse 4 yes came up to me
[40:31] and helped me that we must smite gibeon
[40:35] for he has made peace with joshua and
[40:37] with the children
[40:38] of israel you might be saying that
[40:41] therefore the five kings of the amurat
[40:45] the king of jerusalem you remember
[40:47] jerusalem
[40:48] his father was an amorite it's right
[40:51] there
[40:52] the king of jerusalem the king of hebron
[40:55] the king of jarmoth the king of lakeish
[40:59] the king of england gathered themselves
[41:01] together
[41:02] and went up they and all their hosts
[41:06] and in camp before gibeon and made war
[41:09] against it and the man of gibeon sent to
[41:12] joshua to the camp of gilga
[41:15] saying slack not your hand from your
[41:17] servant
[41:18] now we are not gentile we are servants
[41:21] come up to us quickly
[41:23] and save us and help us for all the
[41:25] kings of the amorites
[41:27] that dwell in the mountain are gathered
[41:29] together against us
[41:31] so joshua ascended from gilgal now he's
[41:34] defending no more gentiles
[41:36] he and all the people of war with him
[41:39] and all the mighty men of valor
[41:43] watch verse 8 and the lord said to
[41:46] joshua
[41:47] fear them not for i have delivered them
[41:52] into your hand they shall not
[41:55] a man of them stand before you
[41:59] so in other words joshua now is working
[42:03] under the command of god i want you to
[42:06] keep that
[42:07] it is no longer just you are working
[42:10] it is no longer joshua attacking
[42:13] now it seems like it's joshua
[42:16] but the one who is attacking now is the
[42:19] lord
[42:20] joshua now is positioned in the line of
[42:24] duty
[42:25] are you following me amen verse 9
[42:29] joshua therefore came to them suddenly
[42:33] and went up from gilgal all night
[42:36] and joshua disconfited them
[42:42] you need to wake up
[42:46] the lord are you there
[42:50] you see joshua moving but it's not
[42:53] joshua it is the lord who's moving
[42:58] that's why david said he teaches my hand
[43:01] to fight
[43:03] you see david fighting it's not david
[43:05] fighting
[43:06] it is the lord fighting through desert
[43:09] are you there you need to be able to
[43:12] discern
[43:13] the spirit that is working
[43:16] amen and the lord disconfided them
[43:19] before israel
[43:21] and threw them with a great slaughter
[43:23] that's good brother david
[43:25] afghan gibeon and chased them along the
[43:28] way
[43:29] that goes up to bed horn and smoth them
[43:32] to a zika
[43:34] and to make them so joshua felt the
[43:37] anointing of god
[43:39] he felt that this is the lord working
[43:42] amen and he came to pass
[43:46] as they fled from before israel and
[43:49] where in the going down to bed horn
[43:52] that the lord cast down great stone
[43:56] are you there from heaven upon them to
[44:00] azika
[44:01] and they died there were more which died
[44:04] with hair stone
[44:06] in other words there were more which
[44:08] died without the hand of a man
[44:11] because in the battle israel was
[44:14] fighting
[44:15] but it was not israel it was the lord
[44:18] but those that died
[44:19] without your effort
[44:22] was more are you there
[44:26] i made an application they gave me a job
[44:30] i made it i made i i made it is the lord
[44:34] who gave you the job now you don't make
[44:36] an application but they call you
[44:39] that's a different story are you there
[44:42] more which die with hailstone
[44:44] than they whom the children of israel
[44:46] flew with the sword
[44:49] powerless are you there without your
[44:53] work
[44:53] without your input then
[44:56] spoke joshua to the lord
[45:00] in that day in the day when the lord
[45:02] delivered the map the amorite before the
[45:05] children of israel
[45:07] and he said in the sight of israel son
[45:10] so joshua is fighting joshua felt the
[45:14] anointing of god
[45:16] joshua saw the presence of the lord
[45:19] working
[45:19] already in his life are you there
[45:23] the lungs that were filled with fluid
[45:25] are no longer having fluid
[45:27] sister dean they fit
[45:31] our soul and are no longer stolen so
[45:34] when joshua
[45:35] understood that the lord is in this
[45:38] thing
[45:39] he took advantage of the anointing
[45:43] are you there he didn't wait for the
[45:46] lord to talk to him again
[45:48] as long as the lord is moving
[45:51] joshua turn around and look at the sun
[45:54] he said i need more time
[45:57] i don't have to ask for the lord anymore
[46:00] he just spoke the word
[46:04] are you there when you see lord moving
[46:07] in your life
[46:09] you don't need to pray anymore you don't
[46:12] need to
[46:13] bow on your knees anymore you need to
[46:16] speak
[46:16] the word because you are in the line of
[46:20] duty
[46:25] the anointing of the third pool
[46:28] you need to understand how you operate
[46:30] [Music]
[46:31] amen hallelujah
[46:34] verse 12 and then joshua spoke to the
[46:39] lord in the day
[46:40] when the lord delivered the amorite
[46:42] before the children of israel
[46:44] and he said in the sight of israel
[46:47] son i thought he was talking to the lord
[46:52] right he said son
[46:54] [Music]
[46:55] still stand you still upon gibeon
[47:00] and you moon in the valley of agelom
[47:04] and stayed until the people
[47:07] have avenged themselves upon the
[47:11] enemy until they were satisfied that now
[47:14] it's okay we finished
[47:15] then the sun continued
[47:19] in the old atonement
[47:23] in the blood of bulls and goats
[47:26] [Applause]
[47:28] without the blood of jesus christ
[47:34] amen and the son stood still
[47:38] and the moon stayed until the people
[47:41] have arranged themselves upon their
[47:43] enemies
[47:44] it is not this written in the book of
[47:46] jesus
[47:47] so the sun stood still in the midst of
[47:50] heaven
[47:51] and hasted not in other words delayed
[47:54] to go down about a whole day
[47:58] somebody changed the calendar
[48:01] and there was no day like that
[48:05] before or after it
[48:09] so from joshua all the way to the end
[48:13] time
[48:17] are you there the first one who broke
[48:20] that circle was jesus
[48:23] are you there and then after jesus
[48:27] there was not a day after it until the
[48:31] end time
[48:32] when gay men can speak to the storm
[48:37] jesus spoke to the wind he broke that
[48:41] are you there but the ministry of alpha
[48:44] is the ministry of omega
[48:47] so when he come down with the second
[48:49] step
[48:50] he's gonna break again and speak to
[48:53] nature
[48:54] [Applause]
[49:01] let me help you up the bible says
[49:05] there was no one who was as wise as
[49:09] solomon even before him
[49:13] or after him right jesus
[49:16] came he said here there is greater than
[49:19] solomon
[49:20] [Applause]
[49:23] and when brother branham came he said
[49:26] there is greater than all of them
[49:34] hallelujah there was no day
[49:38] like that before it ever after it
[49:42] that the lord hearken to the voice of
[49:45] who
[49:46] for the lord fought for who
[49:50] so once you recognize the anointing take
[49:53] advantage of it
[49:55] everybody clear let's go again to
[49:57] jeremiah 29
[50:00] we read it last week
[50:03] jeremiah 29
[50:07] verse 11.
[50:12] i don't know how far i would go but
[50:15] there is
[50:15] more to the sickness that i thought
[50:22] amen for i know
[50:26] the thoughts that i think towards you
[50:29] say the lord
[50:31] thought of what so we have the right to
[50:35] be in peace
[50:37] are you there we have the right to be in
[50:40] peace
[50:40] everywhere we are whether in our home
[50:44] in our job in our car we must be in
[50:47] peace
[50:48] because he is jehovah's shalom
[50:51] brother branham which shalom are you
[50:54] there
[50:56] verse 11 and not of evil
[51:01] so when you see an evil thought you know
[51:03] where it's coming from
[51:04] it is not coming from the lord are you
[51:07] there
[51:08] to give you an expected end in other
[51:12] words a hopeful end
[51:13] so the purpose of god in your life is
[51:16] not to do you harm
[51:19] even if he whips you it is to do you
[51:21] good
[51:22] at the end your result will be better
[51:27] if the lord moves you from a job
[51:30] he must have a better job than that
[51:37] amen amen praise the name of the lord
[51:42] do you know that sarah has a body
[51:46] and the first body that said i have was
[51:48] what
[51:49] barren are you there
[51:52] but when the lord gave sarah a new body
[51:56] that body was no longer bearing but
[51:58] could produce a child
[52:02] when god moved sarah from an old body to
[52:05] a new one
[52:06] he was better than the first one the
[52:09] glorified body
[52:10] is better than this one
[52:16] you don't go like this you keep going
[52:18] like that
[52:20] pyramid amen then
[52:23] shall you call upon me and you shall go
[52:26] and pray to me and i will hearken to you
[52:29] just like joshua
[52:32] and you sh
[52:35] you're sick man found me when you search
[52:38] for me
[52:38] with all your last one mark chapter
[52:42] seven
[52:44] so on joshua we understood the line of
[52:47] duty
[52:50] mark chapter 7.
[52:54] if you're there you can say amen verse
[52:57] 25
[52:59] very familiar story
[53:02] we took the roman centurion last week
[53:06] when he spoke jesus called that greater
[53:10] faith so his word
[53:14] where faith expressed
[53:19] he spoke but jesus called that
[53:22] expression
[53:23] faith
[53:26] so the right saying that came from the
[53:29] mouth
[53:30] of the roman centurion where faith
[53:37] verse 25 for a certain woman whose young
[53:40] daughter
[53:41] had an unclean spirit heard of him
[53:44] we know that woman and came
[53:47] and fell at what just like esther
[53:52] we want to go back to western amen
[53:55] the woman was a greek
[53:59] gentile a south phoenician by nation
[54:03] not a jew so we're dealing with a
[54:05] different category here
[54:07] and she besought she begged like esther
[54:11] she begged him that he would cut forth
[54:14] the devil
[54:15] out of her daughter but jesus said to
[54:19] her
[54:20] let the children the jews first be
[54:24] filled let them be satisfied first
[54:27] for it is not meat it is not fitting to
[54:30] take the children bread
[54:32] and to cast it to the dogs if you have
[54:35] your child and you have a dog outside
[54:38] you must let your child eat first when
[54:41] they are full
[54:42] then whatever is left you're going to
[54:43] give it to the dog
[54:48] it's clear and she answered and said to
[54:51] him
[54:51] yes lord in either way you are right
[54:56] because every word that proceed the fact
[54:58] of jesus christ is correct
[55:01] from the devil it's alive are you there
[55:06] yet the dog under the table
[55:10] eat off the children's crumb we already
[55:13] talked about it
[55:14] verse 29
[55:18] and he said to her for this
[55:21] what because of what you just spoke
[55:29] you must say the right thing
[55:36] when the roman centurion said the right
[55:39] thing
[55:40] they call it faith
[55:44] are you there oh my gosh i don't know
[55:47] what's going to happen
[55:48] don't do that
[55:53] don't do that oh my god my husband is
[55:56] coming he's going to kill me
[55:58] don't do that
[56:05] for this saying go your way
[56:09] the devil is gone out of your
[56:12] did jesus go and lay hands on him
[56:16] did jesus pray
[56:21] did jesus fast
[56:26] put your car in neutral
[56:33] let's pray heavenly father lord we thank
[56:36] you for your anointing this morning
[56:39] which is your presence lord thank you
[56:42] for your grace
[56:43] thank you for your love thank you for
[56:45] your mercy
[56:46] thank you for giving us another
[56:48] opportunity to gather together
[56:50] around the real world father may you
[56:53] speak to our soul this morning
[56:55] and not only speak but may you heal
[56:58] may you feel may you satisfy may you
[57:01] bring lord father result or
[57:04] solution where it's needed lord father
[57:06] may you move me completely
[57:08] out of the way the lord father you come
[57:11] in the power of your resurrection
[57:14] lord we are committing this service unto
[57:16] the hand
[57:17] we are selling the devil out of this
[57:19] place
[57:20] with the coronavirus or whatever it is
[57:23] lord
[57:23] every spirit of slumping or
[57:27] sleepiness or being tired lord being
[57:30] weary
[57:30] we rebuke them away from this place in
[57:33] the name of jesus christ
[57:35] may your power come down lord and may
[57:38] you minister to your children
[57:40] as we committed all in the name of jesus
[57:42] christ
[57:44] amen god bless you you already been
[57:47] seated
[57:49] we are dealing still with the mystery
[57:53] of the two stairs everybody
[57:57] pretty good with what we preached last
[57:59] sunday
[58:01] if you miss it you're gonna be behind if
[58:04] you miss
[58:04] wednesday you're still gonna be behind
[58:08] when we talk about part six
[58:11] we describe to you that we are still
[58:13] dealing
[58:14] with the blessings or the benefits
[58:17] of judah because ruth was separated from
[58:21] the land of moab
[58:23] and taken into the land of judah but
[58:26] like we spoke
[58:27] god cannot move you from one place to
[58:30] another he always
[58:31] moves you to a better place are you
[58:34] there
[58:35] israel was in egypt in the land of
[58:38] canaan
[58:38] or um i'm sorry in the land of goshen
[58:42] and goshen was a pretty good land in
[58:44] egypt
[58:46] but the land of israel was far
[58:49] better than the land of goshen
[58:53] if you read deuteronomy chapter 6
[58:55] chapter 7
[58:56] chapter 8 you will see the description
[58:59] of the land of israel
[59:01] a land flowing with milk and what
[59:04] and god said that it is not like the
[59:06] land of egypt
[59:08] where you got to do irrigation to order
[59:10] your crop
[59:11] but in the land of judah god watches
[59:14] over that land
[59:15] god wanted that land 360 days
[59:19] so god when he moved roof from the land
[59:22] of moab
[59:23] all the way to the land of judah there
[59:26] was
[59:26] a benefit there was a purpose there was
[59:29] a reason why
[59:30] god have to take her all the way there
[59:33] and the first purpose
[59:35] we found out that it was the bread but
[59:38] before you understand when we are
[59:40] speaking
[59:41] about the land of judah here we are
[59:44] talking about
[59:45] our position our homeland
[59:49] our nation our country
[59:53] what is that country brother branham
[59:57] in the message gabriel instruction to
[59:59] daniel
[1:00:00] brother branham say hear me
[1:00:04] god save the lord so there is no game on
[1:00:07] that one
[1:00:09] god will not deal with his church
[1:00:13] till she comes back to what
[1:00:16] to the homeland what is the homeland
[1:00:19] the message of the hour
[1:00:24] are you there the message of the hour
[1:00:28] is our homeland
[1:00:31] that's why we are preaching the message
[1:00:34] because you must be positioned in the

[1:04:38] of esther
[1:04:41] amen praise the name of the lord
[1:04:46] we know esther taps what
[1:04:50] the brother and mother mordechai tap who
[1:04:55] brother branham

[1:05:14] going to listen to the bible
[1:05:16] and the message are you there
[1:05:20] esther we know taps the bride
[1:05:24] and we know that mordechai tapped the
[1:05:26] seven church edges
[1:05:27] messenger which is random and the
[1:05:31] signet was given to mordechai because
[1:05:34] according to the riding of zero babel
[1:05:37] the robber bear has to be made a signal
[1:05:40] in the right hand of god the power was
[1:05:43] invested
[1:05:44] into the rubber bell are you there
[1:05:48] now in esther chapter 4 verse 14
[1:05:51] the bible says this we read this on
[1:05:55] wednesday
[1:06:00] if you dare you can say amen this is
[1:06:03] mordecai talking to esther
[1:06:05] he said for if you are together hold
[1:06:08] your peace
[1:06:10] in other words you must talk you must
[1:06:13] speak when the children of israel
[1:06:16] were going around jericho the first day
[1:06:20] they were forbidden to talk you remember
[1:06:23] that
[1:06:23] the second day they were forbidden to
[1:06:25] talk all the way to the seventh day
[1:06:28] on the seventh day they were
[1:06:30] commissioned to shout
[1:06:32] the power of the spoken word was given
[1:06:36] for the last stage
[1:06:38] and mordecai is saying something is
[1:06:40] happening to your family
[1:06:42] something is happening to us something
[1:06:45] is happening to the jews
[1:06:47] but you are quiet because everything is
[1:06:50] going good with you
[1:06:51] if you hold your peace if you don't talk
[1:06:55] if you don't stand for yourself
[1:06:58] that's your problem for if you hold your
[1:07:02] peace at this time
[1:07:04] then shall dare enlargement
[1:07:07] or relief and deliverance arise to the
[1:07:10] jews
[1:07:11] from another place but you
[1:07:15] and your father's house shall be
[1:07:17] destroyed
[1:07:19] and who knows whether you are come to
[1:07:22] the kingdom
[1:07:24] for such a time as this
[1:07:28] in other words you don't understand
[1:07:32] that the reason why you are in that
[1:07:35] position
[1:07:36] was for a special task
[1:07:40] of this time are you there
[1:07:44] the brother of joseph saw joseph
[1:07:47] but at the end joseph told them it was
[1:07:50] not you
[1:07:51] the lord saw that something was
[1:07:53] happening
[1:07:54] and the lord put me in this position in
[1:07:57] order to save the people
[1:07:59] so monaco is telling esther maybe
[1:08:02] you are in the position you are there
[1:08:06] because god predestinated you
[1:08:09] for a special task at a special
[1:08:13] time you were preserved by the preserver
[1:08:18] to stand for the faith
[1:08:20] [Music]
[1:08:23] are you there brother branham
[1:08:26] he said bless them god all the newborn
[1:08:32] babes that has just come to you
[1:08:35] are praying their tinder in the tender
[1:08:37] little way
[1:08:38] that they shall be fed with the sincere
[1:08:41] milk of the gospel because they are baby
[1:08:45] that they shall grow into the statues
[1:08:49] of who so there is a birth
[1:08:52] and there is a time you grow until you
[1:08:55] reach the statute
[1:08:56] of christ where your adoption
[1:09:00] takes place everybody clear
[1:09:03] that there might be his what
[1:09:07] not only brother branham are you there
[1:09:11] brother branham was an example
[1:09:14] to show you that this is where the lord
[1:09:17] is leading you
[1:09:19] to this level are you there praise the
[1:09:22] name of the lord
[1:09:23] but that there might be his mouthpiece
[1:09:26] and what
[1:09:28] to serve him in this great shadowing age
[1:09:32] that we are now living in the evening
[1:09:35] lots
[1:09:35] so the purpose of putting you in that
[1:09:38] position esther
[1:09:40] it is god wants you to be his mouth
[1:09:43] peace
[1:09:44] if you don't speak if you hurt your
[1:09:47] peace

[1:09:52] everybody clear granted father we ask
[1:09:55] this
[1:09:56] in jesus name amen in the exposition of
[1:10:00] the seven church ages
[1:10:01] why is zester placed into this position
[1:10:05] yes sir the church baptist
[1:10:09] methodist oneness fatherless
[1:10:13] twoness all of them that i just put
[1:10:15] together
[1:10:16] those church is no longer
[1:10:19] the mouthpiece of god they don't speak
[1:10:23] for god
[1:10:25] are you there it is its own
[1:10:28] math peace so god is turning on her
[1:10:33] on esther everybody there he will
[1:10:36] confront
[1:10:37] her through the prophet
[1:10:40] and the bread are you there
[1:10:44] he will confront her through mordechai
[1:10:48] and esther are you there
[1:10:51] god have appointed you for a special
[1:10:54] task
[1:10:55] because the church have rejected christ
[1:10:59] in the age of lord this year christ is
[1:11:01] on the outside
[1:11:02] no king tried to come back in so god
[1:11:06] turned to the prophet and to the
[1:11:09] bread everybody clear
[1:11:12] for the voice of god will be in who
[1:11:16] in esther yet it is for he says in the
[1:11:19] last chapter
[1:11:20] of revelation verse 17 the spirit
[1:11:24] and the bride say what
[1:11:27] what small the world will he direct from
[1:11:31] god

[1:11:40] first age if they block you they don't
[1:11:43] want to talk to you
[1:11:44] don't worry about it forgetting what is
[1:11:46] behind let's move to the mark of the eye
[1:11:49] calling
[1:11:49] everybody clear now brother branham
[1:11:52] continued he said our power
[1:11:55] this is what we stopped last week in
[1:11:57] heaven
[1:11:58] and earth is given to my hand go
[1:12:01] and i shall go with you whatever you
[1:12:04] bind on earth
[1:12:05] i shall abandon heaven what you lose on
[1:12:08] earth
[1:12:09] i shall lose in heaven oh
[1:12:12] if the great holy church only relies
[1:12:16] its power to do these things
[1:12:19] but there is so much doubt
[1:12:23] and fear and trembling
[1:12:27] wondering if he will could it happen
[1:12:31] as long as that exists the church can
[1:12:35] never
[1:12:36] stand upright
[1:12:40] and when every talk of fear we cannot
[1:12:43] sit together
[1:12:45] and be talking about stuff that is that
[1:12:48] are gonna discourage you
[1:12:50] are you there don't be entertaining
[1:12:53] people that bring
[1:12:55] bad news people that bring you news to
[1:12:59] bring you

[1:13:17] about
[1:13:18] my god talk to me about how big my god
[1:13:21] is
[1:13:22] above corona virus
[1:13:26] are you there people are looking at the
[1:13:30] election i'm not looking at the election
[1:13:33] i'm looking at god
[1:13:37] the election is not my solution
[1:13:40] my solution is in the lord whoever
[1:13:44] passes that's not my problem
[1:13:47] my eyes release the lord i lift up
[1:13:50] my eyes to the heel from where i got my
[1:13:53] help
[1:13:54] my help coming from the lord
[1:13:59] get your head off politics
[1:14:04] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:14:08] when every talk of fear is furnished
[1:14:12] and the holy spirit is completely
[1:14:16] in control of the church then all
[1:14:19] fear are gone and that church has what
[1:14:25] see why they have everything
[1:14:28] that have an aunt behind them they are
[1:14:30] ambassadors of the throne
[1:14:33] absolutely an ambassador of class has
[1:14:36] the what
[1:14:38] the signet and everything that crashed
[1:14:42] on
[1:14:42] belonged to that and he said
[1:14:46] go ye into all the world you are my
[1:14:49] witness
[1:14:50] after the holy ghost is come on you and
[1:14:53] what is a witness
[1:14:54] is an ambassador is to come to witness
[1:14:57] something the whole power of heaven
[1:15:01] is right in your hand oh
[1:15:04] why do we set and the church is what
[1:15:08] and we set how dormant
[1:15:12] like we are dreaming are you there
[1:15:16] people live in mediocrity
[1:15:19] and they are staying there and cope with
[1:15:22] it
[1:15:27] are you there my mama was like that no
[1:15:33] my mama died with that disease no
[1:15:36] [Applause]
[1:15:37] you are no longer the child of ella
[1:15:40] branham
[1:15:45] are you there why do we sit in the
[1:15:49] church is barren
[1:15:50] and we said to dorman it's because we
[1:15:53] don't
[1:15:54] recognize these things that's the reason
[1:15:57] why
[1:15:58] we are preaching them to you take hebrew
[1:16:00] chapter four
[1:16:04] hallelujah
[1:16:14] amen hallelujah
[1:16:18] hebrew chapter 4 verse 14 if you dare
[1:16:21] you can say amen
[1:16:23] seeing them that we have a great high
[1:16:26] priest
[1:16:27] that is passed into the heavens
[1:16:31] jesus the who the son of god
[1:16:34] we already have the high priest we are
[1:16:36] under that priesthood of melchizedek
[1:16:39] the royal priesthood of judah are you
[1:16:42] there
[1:16:43] passes all the heaven jesus the son of
[1:16:46] god
[1:16:47] let us hold what our
[1:16:50] that word profession means confession
[1:16:54] you must hold what you're speaking are
[1:16:57] you there
[1:16:58] for we have not a high priest which
[1:17:01] cannot be
[1:17:02] touched with the feelings of our
[1:17:05] infirmity
[1:17:06] but was in oh
[1:17:10] when there is nothing that can happen to
[1:17:13] you
[1:17:14] that jesus never experienced
[1:17:18] that's why the atonement is full
[1:17:22] because every single trouble you can
[1:17:25] have
[1:17:26] was represented in the atonement
[1:17:30] are you there if the temptation becomes
[1:17:34] greater
[1:17:35] just reach out to the atonement and say
[1:17:38] christ you are tempted in all things
[1:17:41] i believe you were tempted in what i'm
[1:17:43] going through right now
[1:17:45] i'm reaching out to the atonement in the
[1:17:48] name of jesus christ
[1:17:49] give me the victory instead of seeding
[1:17:54] and accepting things
[1:17:58] i just can't help it i just can't help
[1:17:59] it i just can't help it
[1:18:01] you must do that yourself
[1:18:04] not your pastor yourself
[1:18:09] are you there why father i try and try i
[1:18:12] can no no no no
[1:18:13] go back to the scripture
[1:18:17] take god at his word
[1:18:24] tempted in all points
[1:18:27] but in our point tempted like as we are
[1:18:31] so god was not tempted like he was a
[1:18:35] sum of uh angel or something just like
[1:18:38] you
[1:18:40] yet without sin let
[1:18:43] us therefore because of that
[1:18:47] come out not like esther
[1:18:52] esther came and began to cry to the king
[1:18:56] god said come badly
[1:19:00] to the throne of what
[1:19:02] [Music]
[1:19:03] that we may obtain what
[1:19:07] and find grace to help in the time of
[1:19:10] what
[1:19:11] in the time of trouble esther
[1:19:14] head only to god to the king
[1:19:22] take ephesians chapter 3 we are building
[1:19:26] i will soon leave the airport
[1:19:32] if you dare you can say amen
[1:19:38] you beat me on that one ephesians
[1:19:41] 3 verse 4 everybody there
[1:19:45] whereby when you read when you are
[1:19:48] reading
[1:19:49] what paul is saying
[1:19:52] you may understand my knowledge this is
[1:19:55] paul
[1:19:56] in the mystery of who paul is writing
[1:19:59] the letter
[1:20:00] he say i'm writing when you read what
[1:20:03] i'm writing
[1:20:04] i want you to understand my knowledge
[1:20:07] in the mystery of christ why do we need
[1:20:11] to understand that
[1:20:13] verse 5 which in other age
[1:20:17] that mystery was not made known to the
[1:20:20] sons of men
[1:20:22] as it is now revealed to the holy
[1:20:24] apostle
[1:20:25] that's the new testament and prophet by
[1:20:28] the way
[1:20:31] what is the mystery verse six that's
[1:20:33] there
[1:20:35] not the jews paul said i want you to
[1:20:38] understand the mystery
[1:20:40] and understand the depth of the mystery
[1:20:44] and that mystery was hidden from the
[1:20:47] edges
[1:20:48] and that mystery is that the gender
[1:20:52] should be fellow hair
[1:20:55] and of the same body like the gibuna
[1:20:58] [Music]
[1:20:59] partaker of his promise
[1:21:02] in christ by there do you understand
[1:21:06] verse seven wherefore i was made
[1:21:10] a minister according to the gift of
[1:21:12] grace of god
[1:21:14] given to me by the effectual working of
[1:21:17] his
[1:21:18] power job to verse
[1:21:22] nine and to make all men not only jews
[1:21:26] see what is the fellowship of the
[1:21:29] mystery
[1:21:30] which from the beginning is back again
[1:21:33] afterward has been hidden in god who
[1:21:36] created all things by
[1:21:38] jesus christ why god wants us to
[1:21:43] understand this mystery first of all the
[1:21:46] mystery tells you
[1:21:47] that you are no longer stranger
[1:21:51] because of christ there is a golden
[1:21:53] scepter
[1:21:54] and the god and scepter put you into the
[1:21:57] access
[1:21:58] of the god of israel you have as much
[1:22:01] right to talk to god just like david was
[1:22:05] talking to god
[1:22:07] are you there so why did god open this
[1:22:11] new way
[1:22:12] why did god tear the veil of the temple
[1:22:16] in two
[1:22:17] to bring the gentile into the
[1:22:20] commonwealth of
[1:22:21] israel what was the purpose of doing
[1:22:24] that
[1:22:25] verse 10 to the what
[1:22:28] in other words the intention of god
[1:22:32] the purpose of god for doing that
[1:22:35] is that to the intent that
[1:22:39] now the what principalities
[1:22:47] principalities and what
[1:22:53] everybody principality is in power
[1:22:56] to that intent that the principalities
[1:23:00] and power in heavenly places
[1:23:03] he didn't say heavenly places in christ
[1:23:09] are you there heavenly places in christ
[1:23:12] that's the believer position
[1:23:14] but he said heavenly places
[1:23:20] oh my god heavenly places
[1:23:23] might be known the intent
[1:23:27] that god has is that this
[1:23:32] demon
[1:23:34] principalities and power
[1:23:37] god wants to teach them something
[1:23:43] god wants those demons to know something
[1:23:48] but god needs a channel
[1:23:51] by which he's going to use
[1:23:55] god needs a scream
[1:23:59] the demon has seen god
[1:24:02] put a television and through that
[1:24:05] television
[1:24:07] he wants to express something
[1:24:11] television was with adam you remember
[1:24:14] the stuff
[1:24:16] to the intent that now the
[1:24:19] principalities
[1:24:21] and powers in heavenly places
[1:24:24] might be known by who so the screen of
[1:24:28] god

[1:31:04] prophet with the blood of jesus christ
[1:31:08] [Applause]
[1:31:11] when they say something like this ah so

[1:31:30] receive this blessing
[1:31:33] are you there shall we pray take
[1:31:35] connection to

[1:31:43] philippians collection
[1:31:46] colossians 2 verse 13
[1:31:50] why do we need to teach them a lesson
[1:31:55] are you there

[1:32:03] if you dare you can say amen and you
[1:32:06] being what in your sin and beyond
[1:32:10] circumcision of your flesh
[1:32:12] as he what they took you out now to the
[1:32:15] land of judah
[1:32:16] are you there quick and together with
[1:32:19] him
[1:32:20] having forgiven you or what
[1:32:23] so you are now clean verse 14
[1:32:27] blubbing out the golden scepter
[1:32:30] because the ordinance said no more about
[1:32:33] should gather in the congregation
[1:32:35] when the scepter comes he goes above the
[1:32:37] law
[1:32:38] bloating out the handwriting of the
[1:32:40] ordinance
[1:32:41] that was against us which was contrary
[1:32:44] to us
[1:32:46] and took it out out of the way
[1:32:49] nailing it to what
[1:32:52] watch verse 15. you're there
[1:32:55] and having watched paul who
[1:32:59] look at your board look at your board
[1:33:03] so jesus in the alpha ministry
[1:33:08] he's asking you to do something that he
[1:33:10] did
[1:33:12] because over there he was god in
[1:33:15] flesh and whatever was in christ he
[1:33:19] poured that
[1:33:20] into the verse 15
[1:33:24] and having spoiled who and who
[1:33:29] look at your board
[1:33:33] so what god is trying to do through you
[1:33:36] is not something new it is something
[1:33:40] he did himself
[1:33:45] you understand and when he was going to
[1:33:48] the cross we were in him
[1:33:50] [Music]
[1:33:52] when he died we died with him when we
[1:33:55] heard he went to hell we went to hell
[1:33:57] with him
[1:33:58] when he was we was again with him
[1:34:01] you were already represented in this
[1:34:04] fight
[1:34:06] all you have to do is put yourself in
[1:34:09] neutral
[1:34:11] and let that fight come back to you
[1:34:15] are you understanding you understanding
[1:34:20] he says has exposed principalities
[1:34:23] and what he made what
[1:34:26] a demonstration
[1:34:30] but now i'm not gonna do that
[1:34:33] demonstration myself
[1:34:35] i'm gonna do that demonstration through
[1:34:37] the church
[1:34:40] are you there esther maybe you are in
[1:34:43] that position
[1:34:45] because god wants to deal with you
[1:34:50] airmen was who m and d
[1:34:54] no yes i'm going to go there even the
[1:34:58] aggregate
[1:35:02] are you there are you there
[1:35:05] again comes from the word arga
[1:35:10] which was the king of alec
[1:35:15] you understand when god sent soul
[1:35:19] to kill the amalekite souls spare
[1:35:23] argon and samuel came
[1:35:26] and killed him but one of the seed
[1:35:29] escape do you understand
[1:35:33] so the burger that was done through
[1:35:37] crust
[1:35:40] at the cross making a public show
[1:35:45] god want to finish that brother with
[1:35:48] esther and
[1:35:54] heaven
[1:35:57] i understand they destroyed the air gag
[1:36:01] they chopped him in pieces by samuel
[1:36:05] but his side was still there
[1:36:08] by the second time of destruction it is
[1:36:11] no longer samuel
[1:36:13] it is esther it is no longer christ
[1:36:17] it is the church
[1:36:19] [Music]
[1:36:23] having spoiled principalities and power
[1:36:26] he made a show of them openly
[1:36:30] triumphing over them in what
[1:36:33] in the cross jesus display his power by
[1:36:38] attacking and destroying principalities
[1:36:41] and what
[1:36:43] este este este

[1:37:52] blessing after

[1:40:51] judas right there hang himself thank you
[1:40:54] sister
[1:40:55] fifth i want to show you a little
[1:40:58] parable right quick
[1:41:00] a lot of people only see three crosses
[1:41:02] at golgotha
[1:41:05] there was there were
[1:41:10] four crosses the crosses
[1:41:13] is that right here was jesus
[1:41:16] and the fifth jesus one and a fifth on
[1:41:19] the right
[1:41:20] two and a fifth on the left three
[1:41:24] now here was judah four indeed what
[1:41:28] oh no what is that right just as much
[1:41:32] cross
[1:41:33] as jesus was on the bible said
[1:41:36] curse is he the hang on jesus
[1:41:40] become cursed judah also
[1:41:43] are you there so by hanging a man on the
[1:41:47] tree
[1:41:48] if you look under he was speaking not
[1:41:51] only
[1:41:51] about the crucifixion of christ
[1:41:54] but the the crucifixion of judah
[1:41:57] but the crucifixion also for christ
[1:42:01] because both died at the same time
[1:42:05] seal of the antichrist christ was the
[1:42:08] young
[1:42:09] the incarnated god judah was the
[1:42:12] incarnated what
[1:42:14] devil many people look at calvary and

[1:50:28] you don't know which treatment to give
[1:50:32] that's why when you go to the hospital
[1:50:34] they pull
[1:50:35] your blood to check what are you
[1:50:38] suffering
[1:50:39] whether it's coronavirus whether it's
[1:50:41] tuberculosis
[1:50:43] whether it's a bacteria once they
[1:50:45] identify
[1:50:47] the enemy then you know
[1:50:51] what antibiotic to take from the
[1:50:54] pharmacy
[1:50:55] and to apply it so the last stage
[1:50:59] the ego anointing come and say you
[1:51:02] suffer
[1:51:02] that let me identify when the eagle
[1:51:06] identified
[1:51:07] he said his name is what
[1:51:11] and the lord already took the key
[1:51:14] and gave it to us are you there
[1:51:22] we have the cure
[1:51:26] you just didn't know the sickness
[1:51:30] you need a laboratory at the end time
[1:51:34] to detect the sickness now that we know
[1:51:38] the sickness
[1:51:39] let's take the medication and apply to
[1:51:42] the sickness
[1:51:49] you think i'm beside myself
[1:51:54] i'm not we got
[1:51:58] the devil elsewhere
[1:52:05] not me that liveth but what the world
[1:52:08] believeth in me
[1:52:09] it is not my dear it is his power
[1:52:14] not my dear it is his word
[1:52:17] he promises here it is he said he will
[1:52:20] be there
[1:52:21] and here it is we got his answer we
[1:52:24] have satan's answer
[1:52:27] god has vindicated himself
[1:52:31] god has proved himself to his promise
[1:52:35] in this day hallelujah the handship is
[1:52:38] here
[1:52:39] christ the reason why did brother
[1:52:42] bradham said the reason
[1:52:44] because the reason was the one that had
[1:52:46] the key
[1:52:48] are you there the reason christ is here

[1:54:06] [Music]
[1:54:07] this message is something else
[1:54:11] this message is perfectly aligned
[1:54:15] with the bible without the message the
[1:54:19] bible is a sealed book
[1:54:22] [Music]
[1:54:25] you won't understand the bible without
[1:54:29] the prophet

[1:54:40] [Applause]
[1:54:47] heaven the jew's enemy to esther the
[1:54:50] queen
[1:54:50] are you there and mordecai came before
[1:54:54] the king mordecai was on the other court
[1:54:57] so it's the spirit of elijah working
[1:55:00] within the
[1:55:01] temple no more outside that's the fourth
[1:55:04] elijah he's working in the brother
[1:55:06] because the old testament they were in
[1:55:08] the other court
[1:55:09] nobody could get to the holy of holies
[1:55:12] the tree manifestation was the three
[1:55:14] elijah of the old testament
[1:55:16] you remember last week but this elijah
[1:55:18] enter
[1:55:19] into the king's presence it is the
[1:55:21] elijah with
[1:55:22] the bride you understand now
[1:55:26] okay before the king for esther has told
[1:55:30] what he wants to hear the all the larger
[1:55:33] the three manifestation nobody knew the
[1:55:36] connection between esther
[1:55:38] and elijah that was the elijah of the
[1:55:40] old testament
[1:55:41] but the elijah of the new testament the

[1:56:15] it to joseph
[1:56:16] it was because joseph reached a higher
[1:56:19] position
[1:56:20] adoption so when they take the ring and
[1:56:23] give it to mordechai

[2:09:40] it's not your birth i'm talking about
[2:09:43] your adoption now
[2:09:44] are you there we realized that the old
[2:09:48] law
[2:09:49] was the son was born in the home your
[2:09:52] birth
[2:09:53] he was a son but the teacher the holy
[2:09:56] ghost raised him
[2:09:57] and then when he was of age
[2:10:00] it's been the right kind of a son he was
[2:10:03] taken out
[2:10:04] put there
[2:10:10] you okay so the purple robe
[2:10:14] spoke of royalty and he spoke of
[2:10:18] adoption
[2:10:21] that's why the crowd giving to mordechai
[2:10:25] matches we find lemon of the
[2:10:29] purple it was the adoption of
[2:10:32] mordecai
[2:10:37] put a purple robe on him a ceremony
[2:10:40] and adopted and that's what you're
[2:10:43] trying to do
[2:10:44] to these full gospel people now to get
[2:10:46] them out of themselves
[2:10:48] someone alone with you in faith
[2:10:52] to adopt them not both into the kingdom
[2:10:56] and give them the right to go forth
[2:11:00] and to do the things that you did to
[2:11:03] strip again
[2:11:04] principalities and power just like you
[2:11:08] did
[2:11:10] are you there let's go back to west
[2:11:14] chapter three
[2:11:17] and that's the spoke yet again before
[2:11:20] the king
[2:11:21] after giving the kiss of hell after
[2:11:24] giving all of this
[2:11:25] the bride is still not known
[2:11:28] who she is as they spoke yet before the
[2:11:32] king
[2:11:33] and fell down at his feet if you notice
[2:11:37] esther
[2:11:38] is in the presence of the king mordecai
[2:11:42] is in the presence of the king did you
[2:11:44] see the king giving her the golden
[2:11:46] scepter
[2:11:48] he did it the first time are you there
[2:11:51] that was when christ
[2:11:53] died for you he opened up the veil you
[2:11:55] enter
[2:11:56] but esther is already before the king
[2:12:00] talking face to face to the king
[2:12:03] after having experience the adoption of
[2:12:07] mordecai
[2:12:10] are you there sunset mountain all of
[2:12:12] them happen
[2:12:14] esther is watching then he turned to the
[2:12:17] king
[2:12:18] and begin to cry yet again
[2:12:21] to the king and fell down at what you
[2:12:24] remember the south phoenician woman
[2:12:26] okay to put uh and besott him with what
[2:12:32] so the bride is crying okay
[2:12:36] to put away the mischief of heaven the
[2:12:38] devil

[2:12:48] law when you enter the temple
[2:12:52] the palace if you are not called
[2:12:56] you remember that's when the king
[2:12:59] put the golden scepter because gentiles
[2:13:02] were not caught
[2:13:04] he put a golden scepter and we entered
[2:13:07] to the inner
[2:13:08] right but now esther is already there
