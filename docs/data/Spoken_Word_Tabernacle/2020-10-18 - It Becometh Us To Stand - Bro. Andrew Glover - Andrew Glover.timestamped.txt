[38:09] believers said
[38:11] amen and amen and may god bless you this
[38:13] one in the book of psalms the 16th
[38:15] chapter
[38:16] and we want to look here in the fifth
[38:17] verse
[38:19] david here writing says the lord is the
[38:22] portion of my inheritance
[38:25] and of my cup and thou maintaineth my
[38:28] lot david says thy lines
[38:30] are fallen unto me in pleasant places
[38:34] yea i have a goodly heritage
[38:38] amen my my the lines are falling into me
[38:41] in pleasant places
[38:43] yay i have a goodly heritage
[38:46] in the book of matthew the third chapter
[38:49] i have a few places i'd like to read
[38:51] this morning if that'd be okay
[38:52] in matthew the third chapter
[38:56] and we want to look in the 10th verse
[39:02] matthew chapter 3 and verse 10.
[39:06] there's there's one thing we have
[39:08] learned that when the devil fights god's
[39:09] got a blessing amen
[39:12] in matthew the third chapter in the
[39:13] tenth verse
[39:15] the bible here says now also the axe is
[39:19] laid unto the root of the trees
[39:22] therefore every tree which bringeth
[39:23] forth not good fruit is shown down
[39:26] and cast into the fire i indeed baptize
[39:29] you with water under repentance
[39:31] but he that cometh after me is mightier
[39:33] than i whose shoes
[39:35] i am not worthy to bear for he shall
[39:38] baptize you with the holy ghost
[39:40] and with fire whose fan is in his hand
[39:44] he will thoroughly purge his floor
[39:46] gather his wheat into the gardener but
[39:48] he will burn up the chaff with
[39:50] unquenchable fire
[39:52] and then cometh jesus from galilee unto
[39:54] john to be baptized of him
[39:56] but john forbade him saying i have need
[39:59] to baptize of thee to be baptized of
[40:02] thee
[40:02] and cometh now to me and jesus answering
[40:05] said unto him
[40:06] suffer it to be so now for thus
[40:09] i love this for thus it becometh us
[40:11] let's say that together
[40:12] it becometh us to fulfill all
[40:15] righteousness
[40:16] then he suffered him jesus which he was
[40:19] baptized went up straight way out of the
[40:20] water and lo the heavens were open unto
[40:22] him
[40:23] and he saw the spirit of god descending
[40:26] amen
[40:27] out of heaven the heavens were opened a
[40:29] spirit of god descending like a dove
[40:31] and lighting upon him and low a voice
[40:34] from heaven saying this
[40:35] is my beloved son in whom i am well
[40:39] pleased
[40:39] the rem says or whom i'm pleased to
[40:41] dwell in
[40:43] and if we could look at one more place
[40:44] this morning in ephesians chapter six
[40:47] i have a few readings here on my heart
[40:49] this morning but i trust that's okay in
[40:52] ephesians this chapter
[40:55] ephesians the sixth chapter and i want
[40:57] to look in the 13th verse
[41:00] a very very familiar scripture here this
[41:02] morning
[41:03] ephesians 6 and verse 13
[41:08] paul here writing he's dressing the
[41:10] christian soldier how many soldiers have
[41:11] we got here today
[41:13] paul dressing the christian soldier he
[41:16] says wherefore take unto you
[41:18] the whole armor of god that ye may be
[41:21] able to withstand
[41:22] in the evil day the man picks this up
[41:24] and says that's this day
[41:26] having done all to stand stand
[41:31] therefore having done all to stand just
[41:33] stand there for
[41:34] having your loins gird about with truth
[41:36] and having on the breastplate of
[41:38] righteousness
[41:39] amen we ask the lord this morning to add
[41:41] the blessing to the reading of his word
[41:42] as you may have your seats here this
[41:44] morning
[41:45] for just a few moments from those
[41:47] scriptures i would like to by the help
[41:49] of the lord
[41:50] just to speak to you here and if i would
[41:51] title this today i want to talk to you
[41:53] for a few moments on it becometh
[41:55] us to stand it becometh us
[41:59] to stand and here in the book of
[42:01] ephesians the sixth chapter
[42:02] paul they're writing he says now
[42:04] wherefore take unto you the whole armor
[42:06] of god that you may be able to withstand
[42:08] in the evil day and having done all to
[42:11] stand
[42:12] he says stand therefore now you look at
[42:14] that word stand
[42:15] it actually means to set to establish
[42:18] to stand still it means to be to stand
[42:21] by to set up in the presence of others
[42:24] in the midst before judges before
[42:26] members of the sanhedrin to place
[42:28] wherever but you're going to stand to
[42:31] uphold
[42:32] or to sustain authority or force of
[42:34] something now
[42:35] another place it means to stand in
[42:38] movable amen to stand
[42:39] firm it says speaking of the foundation
[42:42] of a building it means to stand safe and
[42:44] sound now
[42:45] i love this one it means to be of a
[42:47] steadfast mind amen
[42:49] it means of equality and another one it
[42:51] means of one who does not hesitate
[42:53] amen or one who does not waver now amen
[42:56] to think today that we have all heard
[42:58] the same
[42:59] amen if you don't stand for something
[43:01] then you will fall for anything we've
[43:03] all
[43:03] we've all heard that and it's really a
[43:05] reality in this hour that if you don't
[43:06] stand for something
[43:08] amen then you'll fall for anything and
[43:10] to think today
[43:11] in the world there are actually two
[43:12] positions that the people are in today
[43:15] and then they'll find themselves either
[43:17] standing or they will find themselves
[43:19] bowing they will either find themselves
[43:21] standing amen for something and against
[43:23] something amen
[43:24] and having a backbone not to move from
[43:26] it amen or they'll just give into the
[43:28] pressure and they'll bow down and
[43:30] they'll hesitate and they'll waver
[43:32] amen but i don't believe i'm speaking to
[43:34] a bunch of wavering people this morning
[43:36] and then i don't believe i'm talking to
[43:38] a people amen that is hesitant
[43:40] about what they believe that is that
[43:41] it's got questions about what they
[43:43] believe and i believe with all of my
[43:44] heart this morning
[43:45] amen that there are believers here today
[43:47] amen amen there are holy ghost believers
[43:50] here
[43:50] amen that are not bowing to the
[43:52] pressures of this age but as a matter
[43:54] of fact amen they are standing upon the
[43:56] promises
[43:57] of god's word i i think of how today
[43:59] that this is
[44:00] amen this is not a church full of
[44:02] unbelievers amen this is not a group of
[44:04] name believers this morning but this is
[44:06] a group of experienced believers
[44:08] amen amen men and women and boys and
[44:10] girls it knows what it's like
[44:12] amen amen to stand against the devil to
[44:14] stand against the pressure
[44:16] amen to stand against spirits but to
[44:18] know amen that has come
[44:20] before you amen then who can be against
[44:22] you and to think this morning
[44:24] amen that there are experienced
[44:25] believers here that know what it's like
[44:27] to have to stand
[44:28] amen the bible said amen the prophet of
[44:30] god said the greatest experience i've
[44:32] ever had
[44:33] amen is to come up and get something
[44:35] that i couldn't get over it
[44:37] i couldn't get under it he said but just
[44:39] stand there
[44:40] amen and watch god make a way through it
[44:43] amen
[44:43] that's the way to do it just move he
[44:46] said keep moving press your nose against
[44:48] it
[44:48] just keep moving on and god will make a
[44:50] way amen see
[44:52] that is an experienced believer amen
[44:54] that knows when i can't get over it
[44:56] amen when i can't get around it when i
[44:58] can't get under it then the god that
[45:00] called me
[45:01] and it will come down on the scene and
[45:03] he will make a way and i'll go through
[45:05] it
[45:06] amen i don't know about you this morning
[45:07] but let me announce to you the time is
[45:09] at hand
[45:10] amen to make a stand and then the time
[45:13] is at hand to stand
[45:15] brother if you're never going to make a
[45:16] stand for god he says make it now this
[45:19] is the time and then now's the time we
[45:21] need it now is the time
[45:23] when the church has weighed in the
[45:25] balance and found morning after all
[45:26] these great miracles and signs and
[45:28] wonders
[45:29] that god has sent men across the country
[45:32] ain't been doing and yet the church is
[45:34] in the poorest condition
[45:36] and he said backslidden state i've ever
[45:38] run up in years
[45:39] that's right he said i'm preaching to
[45:41] the pentecostals now think of this
[45:44] and that a prophet of god is speaking
[45:46] amen to a pentecostal church
[45:48] and he's saying it's a poor it's a
[45:50] backslidden it's in a confusion
[45:52] amen but at the same time that a prophet
[45:55] is announcing the condition of that
[45:57] church
[45:57] he is calling a bride by the word
[46:01] oh to thank this morning church amen
[46:04] that we are not just a church
[46:05] amen we are not just a group of people
[46:08] amen but a prophet has called us the
[46:10] bride
[46:11] amen of jesus christ in the hour in
[46:13] which we're living
[46:14] amen the message of the hour didn't come
[46:16] to leave us in confusion
[46:18] it come to call us out it didn't come to
[46:21] give us questions
[46:22] it come to be the answer amen to every
[46:24] question the church would have
[46:26] and to think this morning that we are
[46:28] not here as a bunch of
[46:30] inexperienced people but we are here
[46:32] amen as the bride of jesus christ
[46:35] amen as the church amen that has made us
[46:37] stand against the confusion
[46:39] ah this this bride stand and then it's
[46:42] not marching up and down the streets
[46:44] holding signs
[46:45] and that this bride's stand is not going
[46:47] up and trying to change politics and
[46:49] change governments
[46:50] amen but the bride's stand is coming out
[46:54] of babylon
[46:55] into the revealed word of the hour of
[46:58] the age that she is living in
[47:01] i when i begin to think of this and i'll
[47:03] say it like this amen we stand for jesus
[47:06] christ
[47:06] amen we stand for jesus christ we stand
[47:10] for jesus christ and his righteousness
[47:12] amen says it this way he says i want to
[47:16] go on record in heaven tonight
[47:18] that in this audience here in this great
[47:20] city of chicago
[47:22] in this high school auditorium i want to
[47:24] go on record that i
[47:25] stand amen for jesus christ
[47:28] and his righteousness and i wonder if we
[47:31] could bring that here to gastonia this
[47:33] morning amen amen can we bring it right
[47:35] here in this building
[47:36] amen is there anybody here today that
[47:38] wants to go on record and say
[47:40] i stand for jesus christ
[47:43] i stand for his righteousness i stand
[47:46] for the holy ghost
[47:47] i stand for the supernatural i stand for
[47:50] the message of the hour
[47:52] amen i stand for the prophet of god i
[47:54] stand for the witness
[47:56] amen that jesus christ it's not dead
[47:59] but he's alive and he's here this
[48:01] morning and he's moving
[48:03] he meant by many signs many wonders and
[48:06] infallible proofs
[48:07] my to think this morning that we stand
[48:10] somebody look at somebody
[48:12] and say we stand amen we stand this
[48:15] morning
[48:16] we stand for jesus christ we stand for
[48:19] holiness
[48:20] we stand for righteousness we stand for
[48:22] purity
[48:23] we stand for the supernatural we stand
[48:26] for the manifestation
[48:28] of our holy ghost in this generation
[48:32] we stand for it this morning it's the
[48:34] power
[48:35] of the holy ghost and we stand for it
[48:39] ah to thank this morning we go on record
[48:42] today
[48:43] let it be known in heaven we stand let
[48:46] it be known on the earth we stand
[48:48] let it be known in hell we stand let it
[48:51] be known in the countries
[48:53] we stand amen for jesus christ
[48:57] ah we stand brother we stand for it
[49:02] it's who we are it's what we believe
[49:05] it's the reason we're breathing
[49:07] it's the reason we're here and we're not
[49:09] ashamed of it
[49:10] but we stand for jesus christ and then
[49:13] to think the problem of god would say
[49:15] it's going to take courage to make a
[49:16] stand
[49:18] my bible tells me in second peter
[49:20] chapter 1 verse 21
[49:22] for the prophecy came not in old time by
[49:24] the will of god or by the will of man
[49:26] amen but holy men of god spake as they
[49:29] were
[49:30] moved by the holy ghost and then see the
[49:33] holy men of god
[49:34] and then spoke as the holy ghost moved
[49:36] upon them remember says it this way
[49:38] courage god don't want cowards amen no
[49:41] he wants gallop men
[49:43] he says that's the kind that he has to
[49:46] move with
[49:47] it's not cowards amen but but but gal at
[49:50] men
[49:51] see it takes it takes men of god amen
[49:53] they've got to have courage
[49:55] by the holy spirit now think of this the
[49:57] bible says that men of god
[49:59] amen were moved by the holy ghost amen
[50:02] to write the word
[50:04] and that the word could not be written
[50:06] had the holy ghost not moved upon him
[50:08] but let's preach this morning amen the
[50:11] same holy ghost
[50:12] that moved upon them to write it it's
[50:14] the same holy ghost
[50:15] that's got to move upon the church amen
[50:18] to manifest what has been written
[50:20] then to think this morning the word is a
[50:23] fault expressed
[50:24] see so the prophet amen was waiting for
[50:27] god's thoughts
[50:28] and when god revealed his thoughts to
[50:30] him
[50:31] he expressed it in word as thus
[50:34] saith the lord see then the prophet's
[50:37] message
[50:38] is thus saith the lord
[50:41] amen amen a message coming from god is
[50:44] thus
[50:45] saith the lord see and when you receive
[50:48] the saith the lord
[50:49] then it releases a courage in you that
[50:52] those men could defy kingdoms
[50:54] and then they could defy church ages
[50:56] amen because they were bold why
[50:59] they were moved by the holy ghost see
[51:02] and that's why they become bold
[51:04] and then now let me say this morning
[51:05] church you say well but andrew if the
[51:07] holy ghost moves it's going to make me
[51:08] shout
[51:09] or if the holy ghost moves it's going to
[51:11] make me dance or
[51:12] if the holy ghost moves i'll i'll have
[51:14] some type of emotion
[51:16] amen that very well could be the truth
[51:18] amen but what we need today
[51:20] is more than an emotion and it is more
[51:22] than a sensation
[51:23] amen is more than a feeling amen but
[51:26] what we need is the holy ghost
[51:28] amen to move upon the church and to
[51:30] release a boldness in us
[51:32] like it released in the 120 in the upper
[51:35] room amen let that same holy ghost
[51:38] move in this church this morning and
[51:40] release the same boldness
[51:42] upon every believer here today
[51:44] [Applause]
[51:45] [Music]
[51:46] ah the holy ghost moves somebody say the
[51:48] holy ghost moved
[51:50] and then now what you notice here what
[51:52] happened is when the holy ghost moved
[51:54] it actually brought a transformation
[51:56] when the holy ghost moved it moved them
[51:59] amen from being a coward amen to being
[52:02] bold
[52:02] witnesses of god now think of this
[52:05] revelation romans 8 11 says
[52:07] amen if the spirit of him that raised up
[52:09] jesus from the dead
[52:11] amen dwell in you he that raised the
[52:14] christ from the dead
[52:15] shall also quicken your mortal bodies
[52:18] see then the same quickening power that
[52:21] raised jesus from the dead
[52:23] is the same quickening power that filled
[52:26] the upper room
[52:27] and moved those 120 witnesses amen from
[52:30] being cowards
[52:31] to being bold sons and daughters of god
[52:34] it's the same holy ghost
[52:36] that is in this building this morning to
[52:38] move you from where your eyes
[52:40] ain't into where god wants you to go to
[52:44] ah the prophet said let's know this
[52:45] pentecost how they acted see
[52:47] amen if they were quickened by the
[52:49] quickening power that we're talking
[52:50] about
[52:51] on the day of pentecost they were all
[52:53] walking up there in themselves
[52:55] they were afraid the jews was just going
[52:57] to go amen they got scared
[52:59] but what happened when this quickening
[53:01] power fell
[53:02] from heaven amen remember it says there
[53:05] was a
[53:06] bravery that set in upon them when the
[53:09] quickening power removed from heaven
[53:11] into the upper room he meant a bravery
[53:14] came
[53:14] and he said a bravery sent in upon them
[53:17] he said there was something
[53:19] in it an understanding where they wasn't
[53:22] too sure of it
[53:23] amen a few hours before amen but they
[53:26] know he had died
[53:27] and then they know he had risen they had
[53:29] talked to him
[53:30] and then they had seen him but here on
[53:33] the day of pentecost
[53:34] they met the holy spirit and then the
[53:37] abstract
[53:38] fell upon the believers that made them a
[53:40] part of his resurrection
[53:42] it made him a part of his fellowship the
[53:45] holy spirit come
[53:47] and confirmed to them that they was
[53:50] already raised
[53:52] see because amen can i preach this
[53:55] morning
[53:56] because they were potentially raised
[53:58] amen from
[53:59] cowards to brave men that's a direct
[54:02] quote when the holy ghost fell
[54:03] and that it was a sign that when they
[54:06] were raised from being cowards to brave
[54:08] men
[54:08] he said then that's the same token to
[54:11] apply to the resurrection
[54:13] that if he was raised in you'll be
[54:15] raised now
[54:16] if you're raised now you'll be raised
[54:19] oh i'm trying to behave myself this
[54:21] morning but i don't know if you can see
[54:23] it or not but the holy ghost
[54:24] has come in this age amen to do more
[54:27] than just make us shout
[54:30] you want me to use this the holy ghost
[54:33] has come in this age to do more
[54:35] than just make us dance and run the
[54:36] isles but the holy ghost has come in
[54:38] this age
[54:39] amen to release a witnessing power upon
[54:42] the church now the prophet said this way
[54:44] he said and the quickening took place he
[54:46] said then they wasn't afraid to make a
[54:48] witness of the message
[54:50] he said see that they believed it and
[54:52] knowed it to be the truth
[54:54] see they had walked with the message
[54:56] they had talked to the message
[54:57] they had fellowship with the message
[54:59] which was jesus amen but they were still
[55:01] cowards but after pentecost when the
[55:04] holy ghost fell upon them
[55:06] they were no more just witnesses of
[55:08] flesh amen but there was something in
[55:10] them
[55:10] that was bearing witness with what they
[55:12] were walking with oh can i just take the
[55:14] breaks off and preach here this morning
[55:16] i believe i'm talking to some people
[55:17] today that you have walked to the
[55:19] message
[55:20] amen you have heard the message you have
[55:22] talked about the message
[55:23] you have claimed the message amen but
[55:25] something is moved
[55:27] in the depths of your soul that it's
[55:29] more than something you've walked with
[55:30] it's more than something you've talked
[55:32] about but the god of this message
[55:34] has come into your heart by the holy
[55:37] ghost
[55:37] and it has released the power in you to
[55:39] stand
[55:41] ah i'm persuaded to wonder amen the
[55:44] prophet god said if there's somebody
[55:46] amen that won't stand for jesus christ
[55:48] they won't stand for his word
[55:50] they won't stand for truth he said i'm
[55:51] afraid to say something fell on them but
[55:53] it wasn't the holy ghost
[55:55] [Music]
[55:56] he said now let me ask you are you a
[55:58] part of his resurrection
[56:00] amen or are you a worshiper of a bunch
[56:03] of creeds
[56:04] and then i'll see a worshiper of a bunch
[56:06] of creeds will fall amen they will bow
[56:08] they will give in at the least bit of
[56:10] pressure amen but somebody
[56:12] that is a part of his resurrection
[56:16] somebody that is a part of his
[56:18] resurrection will
[56:19] stand as a witness of the full word of
[56:21] god
[56:22] let me say it this way we don't just
[56:24] stand against something
[56:25] amen but we actually stand for amen
[56:28] there is a standing against
[56:30] and then then there is a standing four
[56:32] remember it says now remember that this
[56:34] christ
[56:34] in the true church is a continuation of
[56:37] the book of acts
[56:38] but the book of revelation shows how the
[56:40] antichrist spirit would come in the
[56:42] church
[56:42] and defile it making it lukewarm amen
[56:45] formal and powerless
[56:46] it exposes satan amen revealing his
[56:49] works
[56:50] the attempted destruction of god's
[56:52] people and the discrediting of god's
[56:54] word
[56:55] right down to the time he is cast into
[56:57] the lake of fire
[56:58] he fights that he cannot stand it he
[57:01] knows
[57:02] that if the people get the true
[57:03] revelation of the true church
[57:06] and what she is now notice here and not
[57:08] what she stands against
[57:10] amen but what she stands for amen see
[57:13] amen
[57:14] pentecost was standing against stuff
[57:16] they stood against
[57:17] hair they stood against pants they stood
[57:19] against television they stood against
[57:21] all kinds of things
[57:22] but when they refused to go on with the
[57:24] revealed word amen they
[57:26] lost the courage to stand and what they
[57:28] stood against has now come in their very
[57:30] ranks
[57:31] what they preached against they now say
[57:33] it's okay they meant because they didn't
[57:35] stand for nothing see
[57:36] you you can't just stand against
[57:38] something ain't that because there's no
[57:40] courage there's no
[57:41] power there's no anointing and just
[57:43] standing against something
[57:44] amen but when you stand for something
[57:46] then you're not drawing strength from
[57:48] something you're standing against
[57:50] amen but you're drawing strength from
[57:52] something you're standing for
[57:54] see i stand against sin but i don't draw
[57:57] strength from sin
[57:58] i stand for the faith of jesus christ
[58:01] that i draw strength from the faith of
[58:03] jesus christ
[58:04] i stand against denomination and i don't
[58:07] draw those streets from them
[58:08] but i stand for the message of the hour
[58:11] and i draw strength
[58:13] amen from what a prophet is taught in
[58:15] this generation
[58:17] ah the thing this morning that we can't
[58:20] just talk about what we stand against
[58:21] we've got to remember we stand for
[58:23] something
[58:24] amen we stand for something see that she
[58:26] can do
[58:27] amen the greater work seek not standing
[58:29] against something
[58:30] will not release the power to do the
[58:32] greater works but when you stand for
[58:34] something
[58:35] that releases the power to do the
[58:38] greater works
[58:39] my then i'll say this way the prophet
[58:41] said if they get a true revelation
[58:43] of the two spirits within the framework
[58:45] of the christian church
[58:47] and by god's spirit amen discern and
[58:50] withstand
[58:52] they discern and withstand the
[58:54] antichrist spirit
[58:56] then satan will be powerless before her
[58:58] now do you catch something here
[59:00] there's actually two things you've got
[59:01] to do you've got to discern amen but
[59:04] then you've got to withstand
[59:06] and then you've got to discern but then
[59:08] you've got to withstand see
[59:09] that discerning is one thing amen but
[59:12] with standing is another
[59:13] you realize david is a prime example
[59:16] amen of a man who discerned
[59:18] and withstood my bible says in first
[59:20] samuel 17 26
[59:22] that david spoke to the men that stood
[59:24] by him saying
[59:25] what shall be done to the man that
[59:26] killeth this philistine
[59:28] and taketh away the reproach from israel
[59:30] for who is this uncircumcised philistine
[59:33] that he should defy amen the armies of
[59:37] the living god
[59:38] see right there david discerned him and
[59:40] then david said he's a he's
[59:42] he's an uncircumcised philistine amen
[59:44] he's a he's a boaster without a brag
[59:47] amen he's a big old and can i just
[59:48] preach to you this morning
[59:50] he told me to make myself at home okay
[59:52] i'm just a country hillbilly
[59:53] amen he's a big old bag of wind amen but
[59:56] he ain't got no talk with him
[59:58] amen and david discerned him but david
[1:00:00] went a step further
[1:00:01] and said he took his staff in his hand
[1:00:04] and he chose him five smooth stones
[1:00:06] see david said something's got to be
[1:00:08] done about this
[1:00:09] amen and when he said that he discerned
[1:00:12] goliath
[1:00:13] amen but brother kelly when he walked
[1:00:14] over and he picked up five smooth stones
[1:00:17] amen he moved from just discerning amen
[1:00:20] to withstanding
[1:00:21] and he said this goliath amen this giant
[1:00:24] has got to fall
[1:00:25] and i say this morning church there's
[1:00:27] some giants in the land today
[1:00:29] there's some goliaths in the land today
[1:00:31] there's some voices
[1:00:32] in the land today that's got to fall but
[1:00:35] can i tell you what david's not here to
[1:00:37] do it
[1:00:37] amen since it's not here to do it amen
[1:00:40] then who is here today
[1:00:42] ain't meant to slay these uncircumcised
[1:00:44] blessings
[1:00:45] you are here today by the baptism of the
[1:00:48] holy ghost and fire
[1:00:49] that has come into you since you've been
[1:00:51] to pentecost
[1:00:52] you are here today to cut the devil's
[1:00:55] head off
[1:00:57] [Music]
[1:00:59] he has raised you up he has anointed you
[1:01:02] he has put a sword in your hand the
[1:01:05] pillar of fire
[1:01:06] has descended in this generation and
[1:01:08] it's not come ain't meant informalism
[1:01:11] and lukewarmness but it's coming power
[1:01:13] to withstand this enemy
[1:01:18] no i'm not a crazy man i'm a warrior
[1:01:20] this morning
[1:01:21] amen i'm not a crazy man i'm a fighter
[1:01:24] today
[1:01:25] ain't no devil gonna stop me ain't no
[1:01:27] never gonna set us up
[1:01:29] if we gotta fight by ourselves we'll
[1:01:31] gather in a hotel room
[1:01:33] and we'll sling rocks until every giant
[1:01:36] falls
[1:01:36] until every demon is defeated and the
[1:01:39] holy ghost
[1:01:40] amen has the right of way in the church
[1:01:43] to move the church
[1:01:44] to equip the church to heal the church
[1:01:47] to save the church oh
[1:01:51] somebody's got to cut his head off
[1:01:54] you've been anointed to do it david
[1:01:57] david's not coming back to do your job
[1:01:59] spoken word tabernacle god's not raising
[1:02:02] up david
[1:02:02] amen to cut goliath's head off he's
[1:02:05] raising a pew to do it
[1:02:08] ah amen to think this morning that he
[1:02:11] went over and got him five
[1:02:13] smooth stones amen the problem of god
[1:02:15] said david
[1:02:16] look down there and he saw goliath
[1:02:19] let's just study the day but he said
[1:02:21] goliath was down there
[1:02:23] miles away from david said he had body
[1:02:26] armor on
[1:02:27] all over he said david only had one
[1:02:30] place to hit
[1:02:33] you know david didn't have a big target
[1:02:35] he had one place to hit
[1:02:36] which was right above the head just a
[1:02:39] little hole there
[1:02:40] in the head armor just just one place
[1:02:43] brother marie said that rock could go
[1:02:45] amen but david knew if i'll just stand
[1:02:48] here and preach the message
[1:02:50] if i'll just stand here and stand for
[1:02:53] jesus christ
[1:02:54] if i'll just stand here and do my part
[1:02:56] and start swinging the slingshot
[1:02:58] and i'll just start swinging the
[1:03:00] slingshot then when i get
[1:03:02] ready i'll let that rock go and it was
[1:03:04] not up to david
[1:03:06] amen to get the rock to the giant it was
[1:03:08] up to god
[1:03:10] to get the rock to the child and if
[1:03:11] you'll just stand here
[1:03:13] and sling the slingshot if you'll just
[1:03:16] stand here
[1:03:16] and swing the promises of god if you'll
[1:03:19] just stand here
[1:03:20] and dig and untapped resources and find
[1:03:23] you some smooth stones
[1:03:25] and just start swinging them just start
[1:03:27] slinging them
[1:03:28] before long brother that old devil's
[1:03:30] gonna come down
[1:03:31] because god will not let his church be
[1:03:34] overcome
[1:03:38] ah the rest of them seen it now come on
[1:03:41] church
[1:03:41] amen can i preach to you this morning it
[1:03:43] took a david to step out and make a
[1:03:45] stand
[1:03:46] it took a david and then with some
[1:03:48] courage to say who is this uncircumcised
[1:03:50] philistine
[1:03:51] amen now listen church david didn't have
[1:03:54] no help
[1:03:54] amen david didn't have no support the
[1:03:57] whole army was
[1:03:58] against him amen but when they seen it
[1:04:00] could be done
[1:04:03] when they seen it could be done when
[1:04:05] they seen
[1:04:06] that that giant could come down when
[1:04:09] they seen
[1:04:10] that goliath would not overcome the
[1:04:11] church the prophet of god said
[1:04:13] it released the faith in the camp and
[1:04:16] the rest of them raised up
[1:04:17] and said if david did it then so can i
[1:04:22] and i don't know what you see in this
[1:04:24] message i don't know what you hear
[1:04:26] on those tapes but when i hear a prophet
[1:04:28] of god say satan
[1:04:29] in the name of jesus christ come out of
[1:04:31] the people for the glory of god
[1:04:33] i say if we and random said it then
[1:04:36] there's a bride
[1:04:37] on the earth today that can say the same
[1:04:40] thing
[1:04:40] by the same anointing by the same
[1:04:42] inspiration
[1:04:43] by the same power
[1:04:49] if david done it so can i if brother
[1:04:52] branham did it so can i
[1:04:54] if paul did it so can i if samson did it
[1:04:58] so can i if goliath come down so will
[1:05:01] depression come down
[1:05:03] so will complexes come down so will
[1:05:05] every devil
[1:05:06] that withstands the army of the living
[1:05:09] god
[1:05:11] oh somebody just give him some praise
[1:05:13] [Music]
[1:05:18] that giant's coming down church
[1:05:21] david's not here but you are amen sams
[1:05:24] is not here but you are
[1:05:26] amen goliath is here amen but there's a
[1:05:29] david here too
[1:05:32] my to thank david amen didn't have no
[1:05:35] support
[1:05:36] amen he didn't have no packing he didn't
[1:05:38] have nobody stand there
[1:05:39] saying david you can do it david you can
[1:05:42] do it
[1:05:42] as a matter of fact everybody was
[1:05:44] telling him not to do it
[1:05:46] everybody was telling me he was crazy
[1:05:48] everybody was telling me he lost his
[1:05:50] mind
[1:05:50] but the difference in david was amen
[1:05:52] that the spirit of christ was upon david
[1:05:55] and david said this falls my lot it
[1:05:57] becometh me
[1:05:59] to take this goliath down my to think
[1:06:02] that's the same man
[1:06:04] amen that wrote in psalm 16 and said the
[1:06:06] lord
[1:06:07] is the portion of mind and heritage and
[1:06:10] of
[1:06:10] my cup david said thou maintaineth
[1:06:14] my lot see what david is saying here
[1:06:17] is the lord he is my portion
[1:06:21] amen the lord is my portion now when you
[1:06:24] look at that word portion
[1:06:25] you'll find the word portion actually
[1:06:27] means territory
[1:06:29] so what david here is saying is the lord
[1:06:32] is my territory amen another place what
[1:06:35] he's saying is
[1:06:36] he is all i have and because of him
[1:06:40] all i have i have see amen he is all i
[1:06:43] have
[1:06:44] and all i have is because of him see
[1:06:47] david knew
[1:06:48] that a man didn't give it to him oh god
[1:06:51] can i preach this morning
[1:06:53] amen david knew that a man didn't do it
[1:06:55] for him david knew that if i've got it
[1:06:57] the only reason i've got it is because
[1:07:00] the lord was on my side
[1:07:02] if the only reason i've got it it's not
[1:07:04] because of who i am
[1:07:05] it's not because of how i preach it's
[1:07:08] not because how good i can sing
[1:07:11] if i've got anything it's because the
[1:07:14] lord done it
[1:07:15] i'll tell you spoken word tabernacle if
[1:07:17] there's a reason why this church is here
[1:07:20] it's nothing you've done it's nothing a
[1:07:22] man done
[1:07:23] but what the lord has done and it is
[1:07:25] marvelous in our sight
[1:07:30] david said look here you all can sit
[1:07:32] there and make fun of if you want to
[1:07:34] but i can't sit still because the lord
[1:07:36] gave this to me
[1:07:38] see the lord give me my family amen the
[1:07:41] lord
[1:07:42] give me my church amen the lord give me
[1:07:44] my joy
[1:07:45] and then the lord give me my peace the
[1:07:47] lord give me my anointing
[1:07:49] the lord give me my revelation amen the
[1:07:51] lord give me my understanding
[1:07:53] everything i have is because of him
[1:07:57] and because of him i have everything i
[1:08:00] need
[1:08:04] oh glory to god
[1:08:09] now i'm just going to tell you david
[1:08:12] wasn't a coward neither
[1:08:14] david was a brave man david was a
[1:08:17] warrior
[1:08:18] he didn't look like a warrior but he was
[1:08:20] a warrior and you know what david did
[1:08:22] brother clean but they went out there
[1:08:23] and he said look
[1:08:25] this is mine this is mine this is mine
[1:08:28] this is mine this is mine spoken words
[1:08:31] is the original seed
[1:08:32] this is mine why we are not the
[1:08:34] denomination
[1:08:35] this is mine things that are to be this
[1:08:38] is mine
[1:08:39] the rapture this is mine future home
[1:08:42] this is mine seven seals this is mine
[1:08:45] first pool this is mine second pool
[1:08:48] this is my third pool this is mine
[1:08:51] theophany
[1:08:52] this is mine sunset mountain this is
[1:08:55] mine
[1:08:56] sabino canyon this is mine oh
[1:08:59] glory to god david said everything i
[1:09:02] have
[1:09:02] is because of the lord
[1:09:10] brother stephen david went out there and
[1:09:13] he marked off his territory
[1:09:15] he said listen i'm not going to patch
[1:09:17] you you can do what you want to do over
[1:09:19] there
[1:09:19] but when you step on this when you step
[1:09:22] on this territory
[1:09:24] you're not stepping on my territory
[1:09:26] you're not stepping on a church's
[1:09:27] territory
[1:09:28] if you step on this you're stepping on
[1:09:30] the lord's territory
[1:09:32] amen because i didn't do this amen a
[1:09:35] preacher didn't do this
[1:09:36] amen but jesus christ the son of god
[1:09:39] amen give me this territory
[1:09:41] he give me this ah
[1:09:44] david said listen amen as long as you
[1:09:46] stay over there
[1:09:47] there'll be no fight amen but when you
[1:09:49] cross the line
[1:09:51] amen when you get on what god give me
[1:09:53] that i am under obligation to fight for
[1:09:55] it
[1:09:56] are you hearing me i am under an
[1:09:58] anointing amen to protect what my father
[1:10:00] gave me
[1:10:01] and i'll just tell you this amen the
[1:10:03] three hebrew boys
[1:10:04] were good boys until you touched the
[1:10:06] message amen daniel was a good boy
[1:10:09] until you crossed him on the message and
[1:10:11] we're a nice church
[1:10:12] until you cross us on the message of the
[1:10:15] hour and there's a fight raises up
[1:10:17] because we were born for this this is
[1:10:20] our territory
[1:10:25] are y'all hearing me
[1:10:28] the reason we're in church with our
[1:10:30] family is because of this message
[1:10:32] the reason we've got our right mind is
[1:10:34] because of this message
[1:10:36] the reason we're not strung out on dope
[1:10:38] is because of this message
[1:10:40] then if you touch this you've touched
[1:10:42] the lord
[1:10:45] ah the lord
[1:10:49] the lord is my portion i'll fight for my
[1:10:52] lord
[1:10:53] i'll stand for my there's some people
[1:10:55] here this morning
[1:10:56] if you had to stand by yourself you
[1:10:59] would stand
[1:11:00] because you know all i have come from
[1:11:03] the lord
[1:11:07] the lord is my portion now y'all hear me
[1:11:10] this way
[1:11:11] you say but andrew you're just up there
[1:11:12] preaching because somebody talked to you
[1:11:15] no you're looking at a 24 year old boy
[1:11:17] this morning that had everything against
[1:11:19] him
[1:11:19] i didn't have a home life i didn't have
[1:11:21] much aim in broken homes
[1:11:23] aiming all kinds of things but the
[1:11:24] reason i'm here this morning
[1:11:26] is because i heard amen an eagle scream
[1:11:29] and out of that voice amen released an
[1:11:32] overcomer
[1:11:33] on the inside of me and that same voice
[1:11:35] is here this morning
[1:11:37] it's not here to scare you it's not here
[1:11:39] to condemn you
[1:11:40] it's here to remind you the only reason
[1:11:43] why you're here is because of the lord
[1:11:52] david said goliath can stand down there
[1:11:53] and do what he wants to
[1:11:55] but to mean it he defies my god is the
[1:11:58] man and he steps on my territory
[1:12:00] it's the minute i draw my sword
[1:12:04] oh it's a spiritual warfare it's not a
[1:12:07] flesh and blood
[1:12:08] battle it's a spiritual warfare it's a
[1:12:10] warfare going on in other realms you
[1:12:12] don't even know about
[1:12:15] but david never lost this the lord is my
[1:12:19] portion
[1:12:20] when he saw the bear the lord is my
[1:12:22] portion
[1:12:23] when he saw goliath the lord is my
[1:12:25] portion what i like about this
[1:12:27] is he says the lord is my portion
[1:12:30] therefore saith the lord
[1:12:31] will i hope in him now do you remember
[1:12:33] we we really can't talk about portion
[1:12:36] aim without speaking about oral roberts
[1:12:37] remember that
[1:12:39] when brother brown came out of oral
[1:12:40] roberts university and he saw all that
[1:12:43] nice stuff in the office
[1:12:44] and he saw them big old hands and that
[1:12:46] marble desk he saw
[1:12:48] all kinds of nice stuff and the product
[1:12:50] of god said he looked at that
[1:12:52] and he said lord he said that man's
[1:12:54] ministry came off of mine
[1:12:56] he said maybe you can't trust me with
[1:12:58] this he said but then a voice come
[1:13:01] and a voice it but look up see
[1:13:04] but look up he said then i looked up and
[1:13:07] he said the same voice said
[1:13:09] i am your portion i
[1:13:12] am your territory i am your
[1:13:16] boundary i am your lot amen i
[1:13:19] am your portion now brother brother
[1:13:22] stephen something struck me the other
[1:13:23] day
[1:13:24] is brother banham stood there and he
[1:13:26] looked at oral roberts university
[1:13:28] and he saw that beautiful building he
[1:13:30] saw all that nice stuff
[1:13:32] and he said lord maybe you can't trust
[1:13:34] me this he said now see what an
[1:13:35] inheritance is is actually a portion see
[1:13:39] it's an inheritance now notice here
[1:13:40] amen remember i said i looked there and
[1:13:42] i said god maybe you can't trust me with
[1:13:44] this
[1:13:45] he said but then all of a sudden the
[1:13:46] lord said look up amen for i
[1:13:48] am your portion now i want you to think
[1:13:50] about something amen because in just a
[1:13:52] few moments of time
[1:13:54] amen a fire could burn down or robert's
[1:13:56] building
[1:13:59] in in a few moments of time amen a flood
[1:14:01] could come through there
[1:14:02] and wash all them nice desk away in a
[1:14:05] few moments of time
[1:14:07] amen a tornadica strike and what was a
[1:14:09] beautiful building could be a rubbish
[1:14:11] heap
[1:14:12] in just a few moments of time see but a
[1:14:14] prophet of god
[1:14:15] said he told me to look up see oral
[1:14:18] robbers had an inheritance
[1:14:19] but it was a corruptible inheritance it
[1:14:22] was an inheritance it could burn away
[1:14:24] it was an inheritance that could wash
[1:14:26] away amen but william branham's
[1:14:27] inheritance
[1:14:28] was rosella griffin william branham's
[1:14:31] inheritance was hattie wright's two boys
[1:14:33] william branham's inheritance was an
[1:14:35] incorruptible inheritance
[1:14:37] and i come to tell you this morning
[1:14:39] church quit looking at corruptable
[1:14:40] inheritances
[1:14:42] in just a few moments of time it could
[1:14:43] be called amen but if you're laying up
[1:14:46] treasures
[1:14:46] on the other side amen if you're laying
[1:14:49] up treasures
[1:14:50] where thieves and rust and malls do not
[1:14:52] break through and steal
[1:14:53] amen that is an incorruptible
[1:14:55] inheritance
[1:14:56] oh we have an heritage it is a goodly
[1:14:59] heritage
[1:15:00] it is a spiritual heritage it is the
[1:15:02] word of god
[1:15:03] and for that we will stand
[1:15:08] we see whether you believe it or not
[1:15:09] we're actually this morning under divine
[1:15:11] instructions to stand
[1:15:13] in romans 12 1 paul said i beseech you
[1:15:15] therefore brethren
[1:15:16] by the mercies of god that you present
[1:15:19] your bodies a living sacrifice
[1:15:21] amen holy acceptable unto god which
[1:15:24] is your reasonable service see be not
[1:15:27] conformed to this world
[1:15:29] amen to this corruptible inheritance
[1:15:31] amen but be
[1:15:32] transformed by the renewing of your mind
[1:15:35] that you may prove what is good
[1:15:37] acceptable and perfect will of god
[1:15:40] now that word beseech it means to
[1:15:42] encourage
[1:15:43] it means to instruct it means to move
[1:15:46] now remember the holy ghost moved them
[1:15:49] amen from cowards to being brave men
[1:15:51] amen the spirit of christ moved david
[1:15:53] amen from being just a shepherd boy
[1:15:57] into being a warrior amen and that same
[1:16:00] spirit of god
[1:16:01] actually paul comes and says has got to
[1:16:03] move the church
[1:16:04] amen said see we are transformed by the
[1:16:07] word now what does it mean to be
[1:16:09] transformed
[1:16:10] it means to be made different than what
[1:16:12] it was
[1:16:13] see it's been its character and
[1:16:15] everything has been
[1:16:16] changed see when the spirit of god moves
[1:16:19] oh my
[1:16:20] amen i'm just i'm just going to preach
[1:16:21] here today amen when the spirit of god
[1:16:24] moves

[1:16:29] into beauty are you hearing me that same
[1:16:32] spirit i'm preaching about this morning

[1:16:36] the trail of the spirit amen we've heard
[1:16:37] about the troll of the serpent
[1:16:39] amen let's talk about the trail of the
[1:16:40] spirit here for a minute and then the
[1:16:42] same spirit
[1:16:43] that moved in genesis 1 is the same
[1:16:46] spirit
[1:16:47] that moved on the jordan river is the
[1:16:50] same spirit
[1:16:51] amen that moved in the upper room it's
[1:16:53] the same spirit
[1:16:54] amen that moved out of the grave amen
[1:16:57] into hell
[1:16:58] and led captivity captive it's the same
[1:17:00] spirit that ascended
[1:17:02] amen and gave gifts unto men is the same
[1:17:04] spirit
[1:17:05] amen that was on malachi 4 is the same
[1:17:08] spirit
[1:17:09] that went to luke 17 30. it's the same
[1:17:12] spirit
[1:17:12] that come to first thessalonians 4 is
[1:17:15] the same spirit that went to revelation
[1:17:17] 3
[1:17:17] it's the same spirit that went to
[1:17:19] revelation 10 1.
[1:17:20] it's the same spirit with revelation 10
[1:17:22] 7. it's the same spirit that went back
[1:17:25] to revelation 5
[1:17:26] and then come to revelation 22 and call
[1:17:29] a pride amen from this confusion
[1:17:31] back to the garden of eden
[1:17:37] oh brother i don't know if you know it
[1:17:39] or not
[1:17:40] but that didn't come from me that just
[1:17:42] came from him amen it's the same spirit
[1:17:45] and the same spirit that was there when
[1:17:48] adam and eve left the garden
[1:17:50] it's the same spirit that was in we
[1:17:52] invented when he said there's going to
[1:17:54] be a threefold purpose
[1:17:56] he's going to reveal himself he's going
[1:17:58] to take revelation by the preeminence
[1:18:00] and then by the preeminence of the
[1:18:03] revelation of himself
[1:18:04] he's going to lead amen a warrior
[1:18:07] he's going to lead an army
[1:18:11] he's going to lead a bride back to the
[1:18:14] garden of
[1:18:15] eden see it's the same spirit then the
[1:18:18] spirit that moved in genesis
[1:18:19] is the spirit that's moving here this
[1:18:21] morning that is here to transform us
[1:18:23] in proving his word 1964 he proves all

[1:25:08] wide handkerchief through the air
[1:25:09] let me just let you in a little secret
[1:25:11] okay i heard a proud of god the other
[1:25:12] day he said right now
[1:25:14] he said their souls getting saved he
[1:25:16] said demons are getting defeated
[1:25:18] sicknesses are being healed and he said
[1:25:20] right here in this building
[1:25:21] i see the devil waving his black flag of
[1:25:24] defeat
[1:25:25] he said but at the same time in heaven i
[1:25:28] see the angels of god and they're waving
[1:25:31] the white flags of victory
[1:25:34] [Music]
[1:25:38] they're waving the white flags of
[1:25:40] victory
[1:25:41] he and now let me just say this if the
[1:25:43] angels
[1:25:44] amen are so excited in heaven when they
[1:25:47] see a sinner get saved
[1:25:49] when they see a demon get defeated when
[1:25:51] they see a cancer leave a body
[1:25:53] when they see redemption come upon a
[1:25:55] part of god's body
[1:25:56] that they pick up white flags and they
[1:25:59] begin to wave them
[1:26:00] if the angels can rejoice at the victory
[1:26:03] that they're not even a part of they're
[1:26:05] not even receiving
[1:26:07] they're not even experiencing it then
[1:26:08] what about the redeemed sons and
[1:26:10] daughters of god this morning
[1:26:12] we're a part of it victory is not coming

[1:26:50] field i'm a message believer i'm a part
[1:26:54] of the bride
[1:26:55] [Music]
[1:26:58] oh
[1:27:02] i'm trying to get to my message
[1:27:05] but it become of us to stand we're a
[1:27:08] part of it
[1:27:09] any man would stand for his family
[1:27:11] because they're a part of him
[1:27:13] any father would stand for his children
[1:27:15] because they're a part of him
[1:27:17] any real husband would stand for their
[1:27:19] wife because she's a part of him
[1:27:23] we're a part of it quite a god said
[1:27:27] there will be a resurrection of the dead
[1:27:29] there'll be a rapture of the church
[1:27:31] there'll be a millennium
[1:27:33] there'll be a new heavens and a new
[1:27:34] earth and only the righteous will be
[1:27:37] there
[1:27:37] only the ones that's been made part of
[1:27:40] this word see
[1:27:41] will be their part and their position in
[1:27:44] this word for their age will be the only
[1:27:46] one will be there
[1:27:52] and that and what is a woman the image
[1:27:55] of a man
[1:27:56] what is the church the image of
[1:28:00] the word only the true believers in his
[1:28:05] word know this
[1:28:08] and can believe it
[1:28:11] see there's some that know it but they
[1:28:13] can't believe it
[1:28:15] there's some that's heard it but they
[1:28:17] can't believe it but why
[1:28:18] are you here this morning
[1:28:22] why do you still have joy in your heart
[1:28:24] because you believe it
[1:28:26] you're a part of it my see then the
[1:28:28] marriage is the oldest institution in
[1:28:31] the world today
[1:28:32] marriage was first established in the
[1:28:34] garden of eden
[1:28:37] now the plot of god said this now i know
[1:28:38] a lot of devils don't like this quote
[1:28:41] but i'm gonna read it anyhow if that's
[1:28:43] okay because i'm not a
[1:28:45] not a i don't i don't fear the
[1:28:46] devil you don't want me to read a quote
[1:28:47] i'll read it twice for it
[1:28:52] i study the other day brother maurice
[1:28:53] said something come to me said people's
[1:28:55] tired of hearing that quote but then you
[1:28:56] need to quit reading that
[1:28:57] and you know what i entertained that
[1:28:59] fault for a few minutes and then i
[1:29:00] realized no that's the devil tired of
[1:29:02] hearing it
[1:29:04] ain't the people tired of hearing it the
[1:29:05] devil's tired of hearing it amen but i'm
[1:29:08] going to read it for him that's all
[1:29:09] right
[1:29:10] he said now how he shall appear in the
[1:29:12] last days
[1:29:13] is to bring the people back to the word
[1:29:16] so that the bride will know her husband
[1:29:20] her mate the revealed word of the hour
[1:29:25] see that by that you are washed by the
[1:29:28] water of the word
[1:29:29] the prophet would say cleanse us this
[1:29:31] morning for this is
[1:29:33] our reasonable service see then what is
[1:29:36] a washing
[1:29:37] amen a washing is a bath and what does a
[1:29:39] bath do
[1:29:40] a bath separates you from the dirt
[1:29:44] that you're carrying
[1:29:47] and you don't carry it no more
[1:29:53] now let me just go and tell you you come
[1:29:55] in from work and you're all dirty and
[1:29:57] stinky and
[1:29:57] got stuff under your fingernails and and
[1:30:01] your wife's got a nice table prepared
[1:30:03] with some with some beautiful food and
[1:30:05] good
[1:30:05] and you want to go in there and sit down
[1:30:06] and say how about a bath first
[1:30:09] how about a shower for amen you know why
[1:30:12] because that dirt don't belong at the
[1:30:14] table
[1:30:15] you've got to be washed to that dirt
[1:30:17] then you sit at the table
[1:30:19] and that's why people don't want to
[1:30:20] fully preach this message it's because
[1:30:22] they still want their pentecostal dirt
[1:30:24] they still want their bad disturbance
[1:30:26] they still want their denominational
[1:30:28] dirt
[1:30:28] but you can't see it at the seven course
[1:30:31] meal of the king
[1:30:32] with the denominational dirt on you
[1:30:35] there's got to be a washing
[1:30:36] there's got to be a cleansing and i'll
[1:30:38] tell you what brother you'll step in the
[1:30:40] bath carrying the dirt
[1:30:42] but if it's a real water if it's a real
[1:30:44] clorox bleach
[1:30:45] if it's a real power of soap that dirt
[1:30:48] is not more powerful than the water
[1:30:50] that dirt will stay in the water and
[1:30:52] you'll walk out of there clean
[1:30:55] [Music]
[1:30:56] why are we shouting this morning because
[1:30:59] we were dirty brother
[1:31:00] we were filthy we stunk we were covered
[1:31:02] in all kinds of things
[1:31:04] but god sent a prophet with a word to
[1:31:06] lead us to the shower
[1:31:08] and say get in there and wash your
[1:31:10] godhead teachings
[1:31:11] wash your water baptism teachings wash
[1:31:14] your predestination teach it
[1:31:16] wash the evidence of the holy ghost
[1:31:17] teaching and get rid of all that dirt
[1:31:20] and come out clean
[1:31:24] our bath is the waters of separation
[1:31:28] am i holding too long our bath
[1:31:32] is the waters of separation see then why
[1:31:34] did jesus come to john
[1:31:36] and say john baptize me when john said i
[1:31:39] have need to be baptized of you
[1:31:41] but what it was was the example christ
[1:31:43] was putting forth
[1:31:45] is that a sacrifice has to be washed
[1:31:47] before
[1:31:48] service see then that example here goes
[1:31:51] back to the high priest
[1:31:52] that could not be anointed until he had
[1:31:55] been
[1:31:56] washed see they go you can read that i
[1:31:59] want to read it for the sake of time
[1:32:00] but you can read it in exodus 29 how
[1:32:03] that aaron the high priest
[1:32:04] before he could ever be anointed he had
[1:32:06] to be washed with water so the bible
[1:32:08] said jesus
[1:32:09] was anointed with the holy ghost and
[1:32:11] went about doing good things
[1:32:13] see in this morning church we are not
[1:32:15] going to be kings
[1:32:16] we are not going to be priests but
[1:32:18] revelation 1 5 comes from exodus 29
[1:32:21] and says you are now washed amen in the
[1:32:24] blood of jesus christ which that word
[1:32:26] for the kelly washed actually you know
[1:32:28] it
[1:32:28] actually means loosed amen so what he
[1:32:30] done is he
[1:32:31] loosed you you were bound but he loosed
[1:32:34] you
[1:32:35] to manifest your spot in life
[1:32:42] god i i wish there was an x-ray machine
[1:32:45] in here this morning
[1:32:46] there's signals coming off of this i'm
[1:32:48] not a crazy man
[1:32:50] these are coming from a supernatural
[1:32:51] dimension the holy ghost is here today
[1:32:54] what's he here to do he's here to wash
[1:32:56] you he's here to loose you
[1:32:58] he's sure to loose you from your past
[1:33:01] amen to loose you from condemnation
[1:33:03] we're able to loose you from everything
[1:33:05] that will allow you to come
[1:33:07] into service oh god
[1:33:10] can i preach this morning y'all remember
[1:33:12] matthew 21
[1:33:14] where there was a donkey tied up
[1:33:17] you remember that donkey and the bible
[1:33:19] said jesus come in
[1:33:20] and said go loose the colt i have need
[1:33:22] of it amen you realize that you lose
[1:33:24] that colt
[1:33:25] they brought it down there he got on it
[1:33:27] and he wrote it into town
[1:33:28] do you realize what happened they were
[1:33:30] throwing palm branches down
[1:33:32] they were shouting hosanna hosanna in
[1:33:35] the name of cometh in the name of the
[1:33:36] lord
[1:33:38] remember that remember how they were
[1:33:41] rejoicing
[1:33:42] at jesus coming into town you realize
[1:33:44] now there's a story like this
[1:33:46] that the next day that donkey went back
[1:33:49] to the barn
[1:33:50] it was in there and there was about
[1:33:51] three other donkeys in there with it
[1:33:53] now this next day all three donkeys were
[1:33:56] eaten
[1:33:57] but this one donkey was real depressed
[1:33:59] he was
[1:34:00] he was real sad he was real tore up and
[1:34:02] another donkey come over there and said
[1:34:04] said what's wrong with you what's wrong
[1:34:06] with you today man
[1:34:07] you need to get yourself together get up
[1:34:08] man he said i can't
[1:34:10] he said cause today's not just quite
[1:34:12] like yesterday he said you don't realize
[1:34:14] yesterday
[1:34:15] i went from being just another donkey in
[1:34:17] the barn
[1:34:20] eating the same grass you're picking
[1:34:22] around the same
[1:34:23] i went from being that ain't until they
[1:34:25] put they put a man on me
[1:34:27] and as he got on me he rode me into town
[1:34:29] and they were shouting hosanna
[1:34:31] hosanna he said you don't realize they
[1:34:33] were throwing palm branches at my feet
[1:34:36] he said you know there were people
[1:34:37] rejoicing around me
[1:34:39] they were having a good time and today
[1:34:41] none of that's going on
[1:34:42] what what's different about me today and
[1:34:44] that other donkey looked at him and said
[1:34:46] well let me tell you the difference
[1:34:47] yesterday the anointed word was on you
[1:34:50] but today it's not
[1:34:52] [Music]
[1:34:54] when the anointed word is on you you're
[1:34:56] more than a man
[1:34:58] you're more than a church you're more
[1:35:00] than a prophet
[1:35:01] you're more than a singer you're more
[1:35:03] than a preacher
[1:35:04] you're more than a deacon you're more
[1:35:06] than a young person
[1:35:07] you're more than a musician when the
[1:35:09] anointed word comes on you
[1:35:11] you are the triumphal capstone of the
[1:35:14] age that you're living in
[1:35:16] but you put the anointed word aside
[1:35:18] you're just another donkey
[1:35:20] in the brother andrew what are you
[1:35:21] saying if you lay this message aside
[1:35:24] it'll be another church with another
[1:35:26] preacher and another musician
[1:35:29] but if this message comes in and sits
[1:35:31] down upon the church
[1:35:32] it'll be an invincible army it'll be a
[1:35:35] powerful church
[1:35:36] it'll be more than an organization it
[1:35:38] will be a powerhouse
[1:35:43] oh jesus got on that he got on and it
[1:35:47] separated see
[1:35:47] amen so what does this message do this
[1:35:50] message separates you
[1:35:53] this message looses you to be more than
[1:35:56] a church member
[1:36:00] well i hope this is okay
[1:36:04] brother man now can i can i take a few
[1:36:06] moments here brother brother branham
[1:36:08] rehearse is a beautiful conversation
[1:36:10] between jesus and john the baptist he
[1:36:12] said now suffer this to be so john
[1:36:13] that's right in other words john you are
[1:36:15] a mighty man
[1:36:16] you are a great mighty prophet your
[1:36:18] revelation of me is exactly the truth
[1:36:20] you know who i am
[1:36:21] you know because your ministry didn't
[1:36:23] come from man

[1:36:37] you wasn't taught this in a seminary but
[1:36:40] at the age of nine years old
[1:36:42] you went into the wilderness because you
[1:36:44] were born an
[1:36:46] odd peculiar child and from your very
[1:36:49] birth
[1:36:50] god began to deal with you and even
[1:36:53] before your birth
[1:36:54] the prophet saw you and you are a light
[1:36:57] of this day
[1:36:58] you know who i am jesus speaking because

[1:59:47] at the ark
[1:59:49] of the lord
[1:59:54] do you love him this morning
[1:59:58] has it ever dawned on you that noah
[2:00:01] stood there building the ark
[2:00:04] with families up on the hill bring in
[2:00:08] their
[2:00:08] let's put it this way they would bring
[2:00:10] their families up there on the hill
[2:00:12] for broadband said and what is the
[2:00:13] attraction on the mountain he said for a
[2:00:14] good laugh
[2:00:17] noah was the modern day driving show
[2:00:20] then
[2:00:21] and they would park up downhill and noah
[2:00:23] will be down there pounding away
[2:00:25] at the ark and they would be up there
[2:00:27] laughing at him laughing at him
[2:00:31] imagine imagine when them fathers looked

[2:01:09] with him
[2:01:15] he just kept on pounding away
[2:01:19] bored by board

[2:02:25] enoch to walk
[2:02:28] wall cradled into a body change
[2:02:32] do you love him this morning let's bow
[2:02:34] our hearts together today
[2:02:40] is there a david here this morning that
[2:02:41] can say lord
[2:02:43] i want to stand lord i want to stand
[2:02:47] here today
[2:02:50] it was becoming the daniel to stand for
[2:02:52] the word in the face of idolatry
[2:02:55] it was becoming to him that he fulfilled
[2:02:56] all righteousness that he worshipped no
[2:02:58] other god or entangled himself with
[2:03:00] with the world only to god only
[2:03:05] so he just throwed back the shutters and
[2:03:06] threw up the sash and opened up the
[2:03:08] curtains
[2:03:09] looked out towards the east and prayed
[2:03:10] three times a day just like he always
[2:03:12] did why
[2:03:13] not slip off somewhere and hide to do it
[2:03:16] but he opened up the windows
[2:03:18] let anybody see that he wants to he
[2:03:21] wasn't ashamed of his religion
[2:03:25] how many christians do we have here
[2:03:26] today by the raising of your hand you
[2:03:28] could witness
[2:03:29] lord i'm a christian hands up all over
[2:03:32] the building
[2:03:34] but can i tell you it's unbecoming of a
[2:03:35] christian to be ashamed
[2:03:39] of the gospel of jesus christ
[2:03:42] not ashamed of the gospel it's the thing
[2:03:44] that holds us in the hours
[2:03:46] when the ship is a rock and it never
[2:03:47] stars out of sight
[2:03:49] and the moon and stars and storms are
[2:03:51] blowing
[2:03:52] it still holds for it's the gospel
[2:03:56] of jesus christ
[2:03:57] [Music]
[2:03:59] it was becoming of abraham to separate
[2:04:01] from unbelief
[2:04:03] it is becoming to any believer today to
[2:04:05] separate yourself from unbelief
[2:04:09] and when you see the hand of god moving
[2:04:11] power
[2:04:12] just as abraham did then it's time
[2:04:16] to step out and move
[2:04:18] [Music]
[2:04:20] old branham tabernacle
[2:04:24] it would be okay today can i put your
[2:04:25] name there
[2:04:27] oh spoken word tabernacle
[2:04:30] what kind of a word will we give at the
[2:04:32] day of judgment
[2:04:33] when we've seen his mighty hand we've
[2:04:36] seen his power
[2:04:38] we've watched his glory we've seen what
[2:04:40] he said
[2:04:41] it never fails we've seen his person
[2:04:45] the great pillar of fire a lot hanging
[2:04:47] in the room here
[2:04:48] we've seen it yonder science has taken
[2:04:51] the pictures of it and everything
[2:04:53] and hear the messages go forth write
[2:04:55] straight on the line
[2:04:56] separate yourself from them don't
[2:04:58] associate with anything of unbelief
[2:05:00] it's becoming to us that we fulfill
[2:05:04] all righteousness
[2:05:07] heavenly father lord we could go on and
[2:05:10] on today
[2:05:13] of your goodness and your mercies
[2:05:17] but lord i believe in this building and
[2:05:18] this meeting today
[2:05:20] lord there has been a outpouring of the
[2:05:23] holy ghost
[2:05:26] lord i believe as the prophet told us
[2:05:29] that day
[2:05:30] when they told him brother branham you

[2:05:44] and lord here stands a group of
[2:05:45] believers here today father
[2:05:48] lord that are that have been through
[2:05:49] trials they've stood lord in the hour of

[2:05:55] day and pounded away at the ark
[2:05:57] your prophet said noah went there and
[2:05:59] stood that day
[2:06:00] when it began to rain he stood in the
[2:06:03] ark store in the doorway
[2:06:05] lord there was nothing that got on the
[2:06:07] ark but what went through noah
[2:06:09] lord there was nothing that climbed upon
[2:06:11] that ark but what passed by
[2:06:13] noah the messenger to get on that ark
[2:06:16] and lord as we come here today father
