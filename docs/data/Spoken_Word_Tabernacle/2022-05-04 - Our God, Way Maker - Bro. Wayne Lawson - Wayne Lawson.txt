blessing to get to be able to be here and the lord making a way for us to come tonight we've just been left the meetings there tent meetings in virginia and and i'll tell you what i was just thinking tonight coming over here and i have a show a chauffeur like brother andrew i thought my goodness uh it wouldn't it be something uh if if we could just get him to preach tonight amen and i i i certainly love and appreciate him and he's been a real blessing to the bride of christ powerful speaker and uh and an example for any of the young men uh who want to give their life to something that's what you want to give your life to something something years ago someone was advising him to get an education and go into business or something and i said with a gift like yours i would never do nothing but preach the gospel of jesus christ amen because it's uh it's it's when a man's born to do something that's what he should do amen and so we just want to thank him for being with us tonight and amen it's certainly an honor to have him and to see each of you we want to tonight to bow our hearts in a word of prayer and want to address our faithful lord amen almighty god who gave us life and grace father we bow our hearts before thee tonight because you are our god you are the jehovah of miracles you're the jehovah lord of the old and have made yourself known to us in this dispensation of grace and father as we bow our hearts and your presence lord we are aware that you are here we are not begging you in our midst tonight lord we are welcoming you we are thanking you lord for your presence among us we give you honor and glory we give you the right of way tonight we open our hearts lord as a congregation of people we welcome you in this building that you would come and move among us lord and that your grace would be known to every heart to every life now lord i pray tonight that you would take your word and you would speak something to the need of the congregation lord and lord we commit this meeting into thy faithful hands in the name of jesus christ we pray amen and amen and god bless you if you have your bibles with you tonight i would like to read from the book of isaiah the 50th chapter and i want to read here something that's just very just on my heart so i want to share it with you in the seventh verse let the wicked forsake his way and the unrighteous man his thoughts and let him return to the lord and he will have mercy upon him and to our god he will abundantly pardon for my thoughts they are not your thoughts and neither are your ways my ways saith the lord for as the heavens are higher than the earth so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts and as the rain cometh down and the snow from the heaven and returneth not to there but watereth the earth and make it bring forth bud that it may give seed to the sower and bread to the eater soul shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth it shall not return unto me void but it shall accomplish that what i please and it shall prosper in the thing where unto i sent it we ask the lord to bless his word tonight as you can be seated with me i want to just speak to you on a little subject tonight that's on our heart i want to speak to you about our god the waymaker our god the waymaker amen i i want you maybe just to from my heart to say to you i believe this i believe god has only one way of doing anything i believe god has one way of doing anything and and isaiah was so uh he was so straightforward in telling us very directly that our ways are not god's ways and neither our thoughts god's thoughts as his ways are higher and his thoughts are higher and so when isaiah says this brother branham will pick this up and he'll say some things very very good for us he'll say there's only one way to do anything and that's god's way if you want to do something you want to do it god's way now outside of that he says now it's all off because it will not reproduce itself he said i got scriptures and things to prove uh to prove that here if brother give me a little bit in the monitor on the side and i'll i'll control it from here a little bit he said there's only one way to do it and that's god's way god always had a way and there's two ways see that's our way and his way and god has a way for today he always makes a way for everything so god makes a way and he actually has a way for today now the prophet of god will tell us of course then that there is god's way in your way and that your way is always the wrong way isn't that something that god has a way and you have a way but your way is the wrong way amen and he says now you can't be in god's way and your way at the same time he says see it's it's this way you're either your way is always the wrong way and god's way is always the right way and you cannot be in your own way and god's way at the same time so you've got to get out of your own way so god can have his way in god's provided way you see what it's god's got a way amen he's if you're going to have your way you're out of god's way immediately when you say well i'm going to do it my way you're out of god's way because you can't do them both god can have his way when you cease from your way but as long as you're having way god can't have his way i think sometimes we are to just say god come and have your way lord come and have your way in my life come and have your way in the church come and have your way in our homes amen because what we really want is we want god to have his own way that's what we're wanting as long as you're in your way then you're out of his way so then forsake your way amen then forsake your thought then forsake everything and rely on one thing that's thus saith the lord amen i certainly believe that the message of william branham is thus saith the lord so anytime you're out of the message way of doing things you're in your own way of doing things so you're in the wrong way of doing things amen and god's only got one way and that's in thus saith the lord and if you can ever find out god's way of doing it it's the only way of doing it jesus said i am the way the truth and the life he didn't say it but three ways there's only one way and it's a new and living way and that is christ amen the anointed word is the way that god does anything you've got to find god's way of doing it god has a way in this age to do things amen and i believe we're i believe we're living in that age he had a way to do it in the days of martin luther he had a ways to do it in the days of wesley and he had a way to do it in the pentecostals and they found god's way then if we find god's way to do it in this age then that'll be the same way whether we're in jamaica or we're in africa or we're in america or we're in italy or we're in india it'll be god's way because god's way is an international way it's not it's not to race it's not so society it's not to education it's god's way to mankind to provide anything that god's going to do god's way of doing anything is spoken in the word of god amen when god does it it'll be in the word amen so if you're outside the words you're outside of god's way of doing things now i know i mean i know what it is i know how men are i said okay if i take this jacket off amen do you see what it is man has a way of doing things and he always is trying to find a better way to do things you know sometimes you don't need to find a better way you need to rest in god's way amen and everybody's looking for a better way to do everything but sometimes you've got to recognize we already have the best way to do it we just need to persist in god's way of doing it he meant you so bro brother it's not working it works i promise you the message works are you going to persist in the way god has provided for you i mean are you going to throw down your tools and look for another way let me promise you there's not a better way to get where we're going than what god has provided in this age amen this is the way god does things so you persist in it i i know what it is people say to me all the time well it's too hard but but persistence is a word that is used when things are hard not when things are easy and let me promise you this god's way is the harder way the way god makes a harder way to go but there's somebody going to see that's god's way so we're going to persist until we get where we're going because that's god's way of doing things i believe that i believe persistence is when you come up against opposition but you're going to do it anyhow ain't been persistence is when you get against adversity but you're gonna do it anyhow because you know it's the right way to do it amen and god has chose a harder way for the church but that is the way of god and it'll provide a provision that there ain't no other way going to provide amen i believe that i believe god gave us examples and i'm i'm just an old hillbilly and i see things simple amen but the prophet of god said it clearly he said listen god provides you with a way to do things and you can look for a better way but there ain't a better way than god's way there may be a little work in it but you've got to do what god provided and that'll be the best way to do it brother ma'am said it he said they've been looking for a better way for a chicken to be born for years they're looking for a better way but there was no better way i don't care what you do there's not a better way there's not a better way for a chicken to guide an egg than to beat his way out of that egg that's god's way now he has to persist in that he has to be able to persist in that he has to get out of that egg you all know what it's called it's called peeping your way out of the egg hey man you it's called peeping your way out there you know before a chicken can get out of egg he's got to have something inside the eggshell to get out of the egg do you know that god supplies him what he needs to get out of the egg and he puts it in his beak isn't it funny brother man said the beak is built a certain way is that right that it can beat its way out of the shell and when it beats its way out of the shell it gains something every time it strikes against the shell it gains something amen it's nothing different than a believer you're going to get out of what you're in by the by your mouth you're going to get out by your mouth amen and the faith that's coming out of your mouth it comes god's provided way it comes by the spoken word and paul said it he said the word of faith is that what i preach and tonight you may be in the middle of one of the greatest trials of your life but if you'll take the word that's being preached to you right now it's god's way to provide you a way to break out of that situation that you're under and let the holy ghost come inside you and move in a special way you say well i just keep beating up against this i keep beating up against it well it's god's way brother amen keep prophesying over your situation until every devil is defeated until every power is broken we are god's children we've got god's way and it works tonight god's way works if you'll take it as an example an old chicken getting out of an egg hey man he gotta beat his way out of that egg i'm sorry it's a beautiful picture if you see it that you it's going to work that little that that chicken don't think so the first day but it's going to work you all know how long it takes for him to get out it takes him 21 days isn't that something takes him 21 days 21 days takes him get out that egg isn't it something that god told daniel he said i heard you the first time you prayed but it was 21 days amen until he found what he was looking for and let me tell you tonight you may have started 21 days ago but you don't give up you don't turn over you don't let it go if you found god's way you need to persist until you get through the trial until you get through the problem whatever it is amen you said preacher i'm having a hard time being persistent you need to hear what moses heard brother brahman said why moses could persist is because he heard god's voice in god's presence and when you get in the presence of god and you hear the voice of god then you can be persistent no matter what comes no matter what come listen i'm talking about a god that makes a way amen our god makes the way you say well i don't know if he'll make a way through my problem look he gave us an example in moses and brother branham said it he said the red sea was an example he said that god will make a way when there certainly is just no way when there's no way to get over your situation he said read moses as an example and you can see that god can make a way when there is no way when you are going god's provided way god will move a red sea out of you hallelujah i know the red sea is in the way but god provides a way over it come on y'all know how i'm telling you the truth you know i'm telling you the truth there's a way over that sea and moses found out you can't cry your way over that sea you can't beg your way over that sea god got on to moses for thinking that he said why are you crying to me speak the word of god that you and this people can go forward i think god's got a way he's got a way he created the heavens he got away he created the earth he got away he created the ocean it was by the spoken word and that same god tonight has created you to use the word to speak against the situation if thou shall say unto this mountain be thou moved and cast into the sea it shall be as you have said if you will not doubt it in your heart i believe the word is god's way of doing it yes sir it's a provided way it's the way god provided to do it you know that's what god's given people looking for a better way to get saved no there's no better way there's no better way so well they think they can do something a special way and no sir there's no better way what god provided is the way. what god said is the way now i know i know a birth can get messy i know it but it's god's way it's god's way to die out from sin it's god's way to repent and be baptized it's god's way to do it and if god's got a way that's the way to be doing it amen and you just keep doing it somebody said well i knew somebody that did that and didn't get through now they just didn't do it god's way [Music] because if you come god's way you're going to get life brother if you come god's way you'll get the holy ghost you're going to get what god has promised to you amen my god is not a halfway god he don't halfway save you he don't halfway sanctify you he don't halfway fill you with the holy ghost but my god filled the rivers and the floods and he filled the oceans with water he can still feel a church of the living god with a baptism of the holy ghost it can fill every fiber of your body the dynamics of this church is a refilling of the holy ghost and my god has a holy ghost to give you tonight it's god's way well people say i'm about to give up because i tried and i tried and i tried come on now they ain't no give up in this bride young man coming to prayer line one time says to me said i've been after meeting after meeting after meeting i did this and this and this and god still ain't giving me the holy ghost like god wasn't keeping his word i said let me say if i promised you that i give you a dollar and i already give you three quarters of a quarter at a time and i gave you 75 cents now now if i've already justified you and sanctified you [Music] why would you not think i'll go ahead and give you the rest of it if god's already justified you and sanctified you and brought you in this church what makes you believe that god won't go home and give you the rest of him i believe i come all the way down here tonight to tell you god's got a way to give you the holy ghost god has provided a way to sanctify a church and to fill it with the power of god my god is a waymaker and he makes a way where there is no way well there's no hope well there's no lie he can make life he can make a way so well brother i'm afraid if i get in that anointing i might scream and shout like the rest of these people well you might but that's god's way that's god's way it's the way god does things brother man said i don't care if you squall and speak in tongues or jump up and down or i like this one flop like a chicken with your head off he said it brings forth new life come on shaking hands don't bring life put your name on the book don't blame life but the word preached in his season will bring life into a body and there'll be a new birth unto that church because the holy ghost will come where the word is being preached [Music] ah people don't want god's way they don't want god's way brother and said they don't he said they don't want it he said they're bringing church members all the time he said but see what they don't want is their max 238 tone talking babies the only kind this word will produce do you see what's going on god has a way and when that way comes it will produce things that the nominal church is not comfortable with just the ordinary church is not comfortable with the power of the word bringing emotion and life and strength i know what i'm talking about people say to me all the time so y'all's like a bunch of pentecostals well let me ask you this who's playing the music there ain't no music going on up here there ain't nobody shouting over the mics and got a bunch of piano music and singing it up no sir this congregation is stirred by the preaching of the word of god it's god's way of revival it's god's power of revival listen those pentecostals can shout and scream at the playing of a guitar what are the church be able to do at the preaching of the riches of the mysteries of god in the evening time we are living in the hour of the dissension of the mighty angel to come down and to stare yeah i'm stirred up but it's a seven thunder stare it's a manifestation of life that is coming to this age it's an adoption manifestation it's a word manifestation it's god his way his way come on church our god don't attend funerals everywhere he went there was life and if he's here there'll be life here if his word is here the life of the world will be here you say well what are you talking about this is what i'm talking about you wonder what it was like on the day of pentecost well brother this is that this is that it's the stimulating power of god's word in its age god don't have a better way he don't have a better way to stir a crowd he don't have a better way to heal the sick he don't have a better way to save the lost it's his word and his power of his word is almighty i tell you what you can find this in the word you can find it in the word you know what you can't find you can't find that dry intellectual denominational way and approaching things i find i find it funny sometimes you're sitting in the back room or church and they and they up here singing and playing and everybody's shouting you come out and read one scripture and everybody shuts up that's backwards that's backwards we ought to get the song service over so we can get to the word of god that's what david was dancing about david was dancing about the word that was returning to the age people said well you people are pentecostal really when have you ever seen pentecost shout over seven thunders when you ever see pentecostal shout over adoption or the godhead pentecostals don't shout over that they choke on it brother they choke and get quiet but the bride the church of the living god is scared by the power of the holy ghost speaking the word that's god's way of doing it i think it's time i think it's time to persist i think it's time to move forward i think the word must be preached in its hour and it's season amen i know i know the whole world right now they're praying for the messiah to come the whole world right now they're praying for the messiah to come but brother man said if the messiah come he would have to come god's way of coming they got away they got a way for him to come they got away and if he comes he'll come his way is that right he won't come through denomination he won't come through system he won't come through emotion he'll come by god's anointed system the word and the word cannot come without a prophet but when a prophet speaks he's introducing headship the messiah will come through a prophetic message do you think this generation of warning no they'll refuse it the bible says they refuse him but the prophet said he will not see a messiah in vain if he's going to sin messiah there will be somebody who will receive the messiah [Applause] come on god don't give you what you want he gives you what you need [Music] and what the world needed was a message anointed with a messiah they need leadership to get out of laodicea they need leadership to have an exodus out of the church into the bride they needed a god who could take them out of dark denominationalism and lead them into blind manifestation they needed somebody who could lead them out but when god sent it they rejected it but there is a group called the bride who has received the messiah and they know the message of the hour messiah is not some man messiah is the spirit of almighty god sure it's god's way brother man said they're praying for jesus he said they're saying lord send jesus send jesus send jesus he said and when the holy ghost come they rejected it come on it's a christ rejecting generation but there's a predestinated seed somewhere that was looking for god's way may i say tonight we have found god's way walk ye therefore in it we have found god's way we are not looking we are not searching we are not trying to find we have found the passage that leads to another dimension we have found the passage that enoch walked to get into glory we have found the passage that will lead us back to every redemptive right that god has given to the church we're not looking for it we have found it we have found our messiah something that will lead us come on church it'll take a bribe to amen that it'll take a word church to amen that what we have found we have not found just a message we have not just found another prophet we have not just found another church we have found the messiah that will lead this generation into the bride's revival of the age we're living in it's god's system it's god's anointed system it's the word and the spirit that's leading the church this is what god is doing come on now everything's going to be shaken everything in this earth is going to be shaken is that right you know why the answers in the world falling apart he said they have rejected the word that is the foundations it's the foundations and by rejecting that word they're falling apart they didn't receive god's way to hold it together so it's falling apart watch what the devil did the devil said i'll ascend under heaven and i'll make my throne like his throne i will ascend above and the way listen to me the way the way the devil did it was he devalued the word in the garden of eden he convinced the angels to follow him in their fallen estate now isaiah said it was in his heart that he wanted to do it but in second thessalonians brother branham saw he said paul saw him in position when he exalted himself above the vindicated word of the age the vindicated word of this age is the messiah of this age and when somebody exalts themselves above it satan built his kingdom by fallen angels brother ryan said he does the same thing today by falling preachers they fall from the anointing they fall from the vindicated word and they build their own kingdoms but it's satan's kingdom and it'll come down because god has a way of building a kingdom that shall never be shaken we have received a kingdom [Music] that kingdom is the word of god that's god's way of giving you a kingdom is sending you the word and how can the word come unless it be a prophet and how can the prophet come unless god will send him and how shall we hear him unless god vindicates him but when a vindicated prophet comes amen behold the kingdom of god is naive [Music] even in thy mouth [Applause] this message has restored authority if thou shall say you went back to the garden of eden brother if you shall speak unto this mountain the message has elevated you back to a garden condition under the anointed word you know i'm telling you the truth you know the devil robbed you you know the devil robbed e the devil robbed adam and they fell now when they fell look that was a there was a tree in the garden in the book of genesis says god protected the tree lest adam want to reach forth his hand and took of the tree of life god protected the way to the tree of life he set guards around the way of the tree of life four guards one of them was an eagle but in the last days this eagle is not guarding the way he's pouring the way he's saying to the church the way has been restored all you've got to do is come this way and you'll walk back into everything that adam lost i've got all my shouting shoes [Applause] i'm not looking for the way god has provided the way to return to everything to every desire to everything you ever hope to be god has provided a way [Applause] what's paul what's paul saying in second corinthians 4. remember he said by this ministry god hath manifestly declared unto you by this ministry come on brother branham said i preached what paul preached william branham didn't just come preaching some doctrine but he manifestly declared the word of truth that restores the bride to the position that was lost in the garden we've been put back into paradise [Music] [Applause] it's the truth why does it say in revelation 22 you you watch revelations 10 it's a powerful reading revelation 10 a mighty angel comes down out of heaven remember who that was christ the anointed one comes down out of heaven the messiah comes to the earth come on now but he has a book open in his hand and he's roaring as a lion roars and seven thunders are uttering their voices and you know what the bible said john said i wanted to write what i was hearing but he said john seal it up until until when until when god's got a way but it's going to be sealed up until until the seventh the seventh angel of revelations 10 is the seventh angel of revelation 3 14. he's the messenger of the seventh age he's a man named william branham we are not looking for the seventh angel we are under his influence come on church y'all know i'm telling you the truth now look what happened when he sounded he released the word god's way of giving you anything is by faith that's true how can a man preach unless he be sent how can he do it but if he be sent he said how can a man call upon the name of the lord in whom he hasn't known but if he would have a preacher he would hear the preaching and then faith would bring by the hearing of the word of god everything god has for you will come through faith your healing is by faith your salvation comes through faith the word was preached you believed it and you received it you receive a kingdom look at this hey man he preached healing and you received it when he preaches the right sir we're not talking about just a healing ministry we're talking about a rapture ministry one that will change your body at the moment in the twinkling of an eye what was it the bible said it's oh my goodness something changed what was it when the bible said amen it said that they had a right now go to revelation 22 and watch john meet an angel john meets an angel and he's going to worship that angel you know what the angel said to him said don't worship me i'm one of the servants your brother a prophet a servant [Applause] don't you worship me don't you do that but he said to john unseal this book for the time of the prophecy is fulfilled the book would be sealed to win to the seventh angel and in revelation 22 john is saying the angel said to me unseal the book who was he dealing with it's the truth he was dealing with the prophet unseal the book now what was he going to do it's time now for the book to be released come on church it's time for the thunders to thunder it's time for the seals to open it's time for the revelation to be made known why did adam lose his position he gave up the book but now it's time for the sons of adam to go back to the position that they fell from and at the same time to return to eden god restores the book in the hand of a man in the last days well glory to god i'm talking to a restored bride i'm not talking a bunch of pentecostals tonight we're not talking to lutherans or wesleyans we are talking to a word restored bride who's been positionally placed by the message of the hour [Applause] unseal it they have a right to the tree of life they got a right to the tree of life that's what adam couldn't get back to was the tree of life but you have been invited to return to the tree of life god's way to return is by the word and a word can't come unless the prophet comes the word of the prophet is the return of the church to the tree of life oh glory to god it's the way brother it's the way i woke up with this on my mind this morning i woke up thinking about this this morning that this church has a redemptive right this church has a redemptive right you say what is a redemptive right it's a covenant right a redemptive right means a right that adam held but forfeited but the church today amen is not forfeiting their rights they're receiving their rights come on john come and take this book it's your right to the tree of life it's your right to redemption it's your right to your authority it's your right to your healing it's everything it's the sealed documents of eternal life and we have them in our hands [Applause] they said preacher what are you so excited about i tell you what cause samson typed you and all he had was a jawbone of a mule and he killed a thousand philistines with it shamgar had an oxnard and killed 600 with it amen can you imagine with an oxnard with a with a bone the king the king of israel with a with a with a spear smoke the army twice amen but you know tonight you don't have no spear in your hand you don't have no rock in your hand you don't have no oxnard in your hand you don't have a jawbone of a mule in your hand you've got the book of redemption given back to the church what is in thine hand the title deed to the whole thing with an abstract and my name is written on the pages of it so i'll tell you what brother right here tonight i got a right to tell the devil get off of my property god has given me a way to take authority over every demon power [Applause] every spirit that comes against us you've got a right to tell that devil tonight pack up your bags and get out y'all don't know i tell you truth you know what's the truth if you go home tonight after this meeting and find somebody sitting in your chair they broke in and moved in while you were gone and you come home to them sitting in your chair you'd look them over what are you doing in here they said well i'm taking over you said no wait a minute no sir no sir you're going to have to leave they said no i've got a right to stay then you have to produce the documents it's my home it's my place if they won't go you call the police a provided way to get somebody out of your house is pick up the phone and dial 9-1-1 that's a provided way it'll work it'll work for you tonight because you're a citizen in this country so the law works for you as a citizen of this nation but i'm not talking to a bunch of americans tonight i'm talking to christians and we're citizens of the most high god's kingdom and the devil has moved in on your property you got the right tonight to tell that devil get off of my redeemed property brother if he don't want to move you got to pick up the word and move him i'm not talking about hitting the devil with a book i'm talking about the word that's in your mouth you got to tell that devil it's god's way it's god's way to do it it's god's provision to do it we are god's people this is god's way and we've been activated tonight to prophesy every redemptive right every redemptive ride has been returned to you it's a beautiful law in the scripture it's called a kinsmen redeemer y'all know i don't want to teach it amen but you know ruth you know ruth you know her she was a mob artist but she was going home you're a gentile and you're going home [Applause] god's provided away you got home and you didn't have nothing you got back to israel and you didn't have no money you didn't have no food you didn't have no efforts but god had already provided a law that was a law already in the bible before they ever needed it god had provided it in the word it's god's way it's a law of kinsmen i heard you out here talking about boaz it's a beautiful story ruth it's a beautiful story ruth amen found the right field at the right time and he said you are a virtuous woman who called you the virgin bride anyhow it wasn't just a servant it was the lord of the field that has come in this age he provided a way to take you from your harley tree and put you as a virgin in the scripture look at what look at what she did she worked in the right field brother it was the field of redemption it was the field that bo has amen she didn't come in just any time she didn't just come anytime she wanted she was representing you so she had to come at a certain season when she returned to israel it was harvest season it was barley season at that time in the field a little while and your confidence will get enough to come lay at his feet i just heard brother random on tape this morning he said she went back and asked naomi what's the way to be redeemed you know what brother adam said he said naomi was the old testament example that would teach you how to get redemption so she asked for an example and brother adam said the old testament is an example it holds the law of kinsmen if you go to the scripture it will tell you how to get redeemed god's way is a kinsmen redeemer [Applause] she got enough confidence from the example naomi until she said go lay at his feet in the harvest on the barley field go right there in the threshing floor when the judgments are going forth and the seed is being separated from the husk there's where the bride will come out there's where she will get rid of the husk he's on the threshing floor come on every wind of doctrine will come through but it'll never blow that pride because in harvest the life of the plant goes into the seed but it's not moisture it's oil the oil resides in the seed which gives its weight but it's not blown around it can hold its position in the middle of doctrines in the middle troubles it'll hold its place because there's oil everything in the plant goes into the seed all that was in luther is in this bride all that was in wesley's in this bride all that was in pentecost can i say it later all that was in god was poured into christ and all that was in christ has been poured into the seed word pride of jesus christ and in the hour of harvest she proves she's not a shock brother she's a seed to begin with harvest season seed separating from the shock all at the same time of the marriage of ruth [Music] she went and laid his feet the other man said that was confidence and heard that he could redeem her i tell you where my confidence is tonight it's in this kinsmen redeemer i don't have any confidence in the baptist or the lutheran or the wesleyans or the pentecostals i don't have any confidence in man but i have confidence in the quickening power of god in this age that he can raise a man up [Music] sure he could do it for her and god provided a way he said here's what you got to do you got to get his attention you know what the kinsmen had to do he had to go call the elders there was ten of them he had to call the elders you know what they knew they knew the law and they knew the prophets they knew what it took to make a kinsmen it took a certain law to be met they didn't get rid of the law somebody had to fulfill the law you're not getting rid of the law somebody fulfills the law [Applause] and boaz boaz went to his elders and they knew he had to be wealthy he had to be able to redeem he had to be kinsmen there was a list of laws he had to meet and what he done is he went before them and began to testify i am this woman's kinsmen i have the wealth to take her i have the ability to to give her seed i i can do this and the elders you know what they said you know what film elders said back worthy he's worthy boaz was worthy of redeeming ruth it was an act of redemption that redeemed her which was only a foretaste of revelations the fifth chapter when jesus our redeemer had to make an action of redemption he had already died for the church so he was rich in the blood but the names that was in that book amen was filthy and dirty and ungodly and not worthy of nothing but when he took the book he went before the elders 24 elders they knew the law and they knew the prophets and he held up the book of redemption that had you in it and he said they're my kinsmen they're mine they're all kin to me and i shed my blood for them and the bible said those 24 elders threw their crowns on the ground and said worthy is the lamb i say tonight worthy is the lamb of god to redeem us it's god's way of redeeming it's god's way of doing it brother you know what he did he made a testimony and then he tore the seals off of that book oh you know it's true he tore the seals off of that book and unsealed every redemptive right that was lost and was restored back to the church and under the ministry of elohim he restored everything back that we had lost [Applause] now y'all know i'm in the message strong right here brother branham said when he took that book he said the legal possession of that book meant it meant something it meant that god had restored everything that adam had lost i say to you tonight we are not a growing bride we are not a maturing pride we are not a coming pride we are a perfectly restored church by the power of god's provided way of doing it didn't he say shall be here didn't he say it was coming didn't he say there was a bribe would be on the earth from the last day didn't he say it he said my word cannot go out void but it shall accomplish [Applause] isaiah was a fallen man isaiah was born of a woman he was a fallen man brother brown said when he stood out to prophesy he should have come through eve by the spoken word isaiah should have been a spoken word child but fallen god got into him and prophesied his own redemption and said a virgin shall conceive well 700 years the word 700 years the word looked for a womb it looked for a womb to bring redemption through but when mary said be it unto me according to thy word she had abraham's seed right there now come on y'all know what i'm talking about i'm talking about a vindicated prophet today that is prophesied of an adopted church he's prophesied about a bride he will come into maturity and walk from this dimension to another that word will not return void the only way the word can go back to heaven is in flesh jesus said i come from god and i go back to god he came the word but he returned the word made flesh you came here as a spoken word seed bride but we're not going back as a word seed we're going back as the word and flesh conquering victorious over every problem because god made the way come on ruth god made a way for redemption god made a way to get home god made a way to restore you brother branham where's that grizzly bear coming from where's that grizzly bear coming from god made a way god made a way it was word it couldn't be void it had to be flesh god made the way how did you get here don't give me some some lucky story i was lucky in this happening this way that was god making a way how did you how did you escape the grip of satan trying to drag you out of the word of god i'll tell you how you did it god made a way [Applause] god made a way of escape for you come on church how did daniel get out of the lines then god made a way how did the hebrew children survive the fire god made a way how have you gotten out of laodicea god made the way. he's the god that makes a way when there is no way you might be sitting here tonight i said brother wayne how am i going to get over this god's made a way he's made a way to get you out of every trial amen there is no temptation which come upon you that god has not provided a way of escape with every temptation there is a way of escape this message is your exodus out of temptation it's out of laodicea it's out of the elements of these bodies [Applause] god has made a way for us to walk in the path of victory god has made a way for us to walk like enoch walk to talk like moses talk and speak the name of the lord to preach the message of the hour to believe the word of faith god made the way how did he make the way he put a seed inside you the seed in you is the same seed in this bible it existed before the foundation of the world god made the way for you to have a birth before you were ever here [Music] this message will pull you it'll pull you out of every problem every situation listen you're sitting right here tonight you've got troubles in your life god made a way you don't have to live like that god made a way says he made a way to make a claim he made a way he gave us when we got way more children he made a way god made a way and used had his right to prove it he said that's my way of claiming children you need a storm out of your life god's made a way speak to that storm [Music] so brother wayne there's just no way you all tore up there's just no way you're serving the god that makes the way [Music] i was over in india brother isaac brother isaac vasil tomorrow you've been with me in his church in chennai india real real good pastor and he had a little he had a little apartment and a big family so he moved out of the apartment that he bought

you an eagle he called you an eagle you know why he called you an eagle brother branham said he called you an eagle because an eagle is the only bird that can go all the way down and be renewed back again because god made a way for him to renew himself and god made a way for you to be renewed because you're an eagle you can get so low that you think i'll never rise again but god begins to speak and the bible says the eagle rises at his command well i've heard the call rise and shine thy light has come i feel the winds of redemption blowing across the church i say little eagle just spread
