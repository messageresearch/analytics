amen so we see you and Lord's willing we had a wonderful time yesterday and as soon as I left the Holy Spirit open up again a scripture that I I I read that scripture before but I never seen it in that angle and the Holy Spirit open and I have a hard time getting into this seron because I was moving with two anointing there is still things coming from the c meeting so I have to stop and get those quickly before they go and then come back again so I went to sleep toward after 3:00 so you should be stronger than me are we together amen praise God so Lord's willing March the 22nd we go and same place everything the same the time is still the same and we continue with our subject if you have a question put it so I'm going to work on it there are a couple couple things that are left out

love again amen the formality the routine and everything that we turn into labor remove that completely go back to the first law amen glory to God question and answer sir Lord's willing uh brother Glenn is working on the venue so we'll let you know in the future for recap next week service on Tuesday 7:30 here December 31st Tuesday New Year's Eve service 8 p.m. on February 1st young men February 22nd young sisters March 22nd married C of meeting part five are we clear praise God there was a question that was placed in the question box and I miss it and it was about the young sister's meeting so I thought about answering that because we took courtship one we took courtship two and then we finished now we're getting prepared for the engagement but somebody put a question and I miss it so I didn't get it but I thought it's good for me to answer that question from the pulpit so that the parent knows where we stand standing because when I give instruction according to the prophet and the word if you are going different than your children you getting you are confusing them and it create tension at home we don't want tension and the question was I believe it's a young sister she put a question she say a young man approach her and ask for her number so that he will know her better should I give the number or not according to what we taught you amen do not give the number can you say amen amen H don't give the number to that young man that young man need to be bold enough amen come on are we together to go see your parent amen come ony come on parent can you say Amen that young man need to come home and see your father and your mother and talk to them and ask permission there first before he start talking to you are we together are we together so no communication should exist without the parent being aare and the parent will have to monitor you both of you during your courtship during your engagement until you get married and the pastor should be aware of that so I can send my drones are we together and investigate that man very well which church he's coming through which Ministry has he been under what kind of parent did he live with so I will know clearly where you going because you are my [Applause] children are we together are we together in one sense I will blame the pulpit amen because brother Bram say it's Pulpit delinquency we didn't take time to teach the young people what they are supposed to do we bind on them on the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost and we left all the other aspect of life amen amen so sometime do not be too hard on the young man I'm going to go slowly my friend sometime don't be rude toward the young man the young man might not have the same teaching that you have here are we together but I'm going to hold you responsible if you don't stand on your ground in other word if the young man comes do you follow me this is the best that he knows sometime he doesn't mean bad this is what he knows give me your number so it's your responsibility young sister to recalibrate the young man I don't know if we together are we together are we together politely gently smiling you say God bless you brother yes are we together I appreciate your interest in me but this is not the way things are done that's right if you want to talk to me and you need my number I will advise you to talk to my parent come and talk to my parent and then you can express your desire over there if they agree then we can go ahead in Exchange number and begin to talk you help that young man am if he's a Christian a true young man he will humble himself to the word are we together but if he refuse to Humble himself Andis to get your number oh go find your friends in the message and to get your number and begin to text you and say hello you say how did you get my number I gaed from somebody because they don't want to disclose who gave them the number if this is the way he's approaching he's not entering from the door he's trying to enter from the window he's a fast you didn't get me you didn't get me he's a fief give me a call you didn't get me well if he approach you that way after you already spoke to him give me a call deliver him unto my hand and let me go talk to his Pastor do you understand what I'm saying and I would let know his Pastor what he's doing are we together I'm going to protect you until you get married over there until we bless you either in this church or somewhere else until we deliver you in the hand of your husband I want you to be respected honored and protected are we okay may the parent say Amen any relationship from the back door cut it off we don't want sneaky people hallelujah if you love a young man if you love a young sister you have not seen so why are you hiding why are you hiding come openly be man enough are we together so young sister don't tell them you are not being taught well no no no no no no no you talk to them gently you say I understand where you're coming from but there is a procedure according to the word come and talk to my parent if he's bold enough to enter and talk to your parent then you can come and talk to me amen and remember you only getting into courtship IM might work or IM might not work come on if it doesn't work don't be sad pull back slowly and gently and say brother it didn't work maybe I'm not the right one but brother Bram say if I love you so much I will wish you the best with somebody else are we together and let that young man be free he might come back to your friend amen don't block him like because he didn't work don't come to spoken word you're not the one holding everybody if it didn't work with you let him go somewhere don't destroy his character don't destroy the young sister's character respect one another it didn't work it didn't work because courtship you trying to see if it [Applause] works are we together amen are we together because in this message young sister have a tendency to Horn husband it's like this is mine ah so if he didn't work nobody should marry him uhh he didn't work with you maybe was not your husband but you sister so and so husband do not create tension wait for your husband and everybody will be happy parent are we together are we together if we together let's clap our hand for the [Music] Lord so young men who are not in spoken word if you interested to assist this is the procedure that's it I'm sending as a Shepherd I got to protect the Sheep this is my position come to the front door if you enter the back door or tunnel like hammers then I have to use a ballistic missile I have to block the bank and destroy the whole building all the way down I don't have any choice Zero Tolerance because you came the wrong [Applause] way are we together are we together I love you so much I love this church so much that I don't want any trouble with you are we together let's do things right when you start right the remaining will go right when you already start on the right foot even if something happened the Lord will help you and he will correct and make everything to work together for good are we together amen are we together amen even if you are in this church come on because the spirit just dropped that on me and you got used to one another because we on the same church and we go outside and change number hey don't say Amen can you say Amen my amen even if you are in the same church the procedures still [Applause] apply are we together I don't believe in young men texting with young sisters all the time texting texting how are you doing uh-uh you grown up my friend we know your intention come on go to the front [Music] door how did you get the number no he we were exchanging uh h a link for the service today that's how I got the number even if you got that number like that before you talk to her go back see the parents are we together are we together that young sister will respect you more right amen are we

we have a lot to debunk so make sure you stay up let's go to verse six I I have said ye are gods and all of you are children of the most high you might be seated this is a Divine record you already know this verse seven but you shall die like men and fall like one of the princes so verse six here like we said speak about our divine record our book or life or identity and verse seven speak about our natural record all Earthly are we together this record is connected to death it's connected to sin it is connected to fall this is a spotless record it's a Divine one yes it speaks about deity about God are we together now you say brother Steven how can you take one scripture and keep ping on it for three month amen with me if I can get the cat to come up oh glory to God I already gave brother Rober the backup so it's working glory to God it's the devil it's coming let's go to the Book of Luke I know you certain but we're going to get it through that's right amen hallelujah what is here will save somebody and will clarify something for you who still have a problem with it Luke 15 if you thereare you can say Amen let's drop to verse 11 the Bible say and he said a certain man has two sons got two kids here now it's clear right yes we got the Elder one yes and we got the younger one the Elder one is who the Jew the Jews or who or Israel and the younger one is the Gentile are we together amen and according to the sons of Joseph the older one is manasse we clear and the younger one is Ephraim you remember last Sunday right praise God and then the Bible says verse 12 and the younger one of them say to his father the Gentile father give me the portion of goods that falls to me and the father he divided to them his living are we together verse 13 and not many days after the younger son gather all together together and when he gathered the Bible say and he took his journey into a far country Lord help me if we can reach far country today journey into a far country amen you will see what those words means he said he took journey to a far country and there wasted his substance the substance of the father that was given to him him with riotous living when you say riotous living it's really not uh specific it's vague we can put anything there but I want to be specific to what did he really do jum to verse 30 then we're going to come back up again if you thereare you can say amen amen Robert I might need that back up verse 30 but as soon as this your son was come which has devoured your living with who Harlot so this young boy was involved in a life with Harlot how many harlots plural you remember what it means right thank you my brother brother with Harlot amen he divide with his living with the harlots and you have killed for him the F calf so the all the son is saying him spending all the money with the Harlot amen and what you did for him you gave him the fatted Cal why a Fed Cal for somebody who was with the harot are we together let go back to verse 17 Hallelujah bear with me somehow this thing is going to work amen CU I got to deliver this material praise God in verse 17 the Bible say and when he came to himself he said how many hired servant of my fathers have bread enough and to spare and I perish with Hunger he came to himself meaning everything he was doing he was not himself are we together we already clarified that one so everything he was doing he was not himself he had another nature yes are we together amen ah because he came to himself so you need to blame that nature amen yeah blame that nature but don't blame him and if you kill that nature so his problem is gone ex see this one glory to God yes he will work my friend amen amen jop to verse 20 and he arose and came to his father but when he was yet a great way off his father saw him and had compassion and ran and fell on his neck and kissed him you know what it means MH and the son said to him he says father I have Sinn against Heaven are we together the son was coming back as a sinner toward his father are we together so he has a problem of sin there is a sin issue here and sin issue needs a sin offering that's right am are we together uhhuh he says and I have Sinn against heaven and in your sight I am no more worthy to be called your son but the father said to his servant bring forth the best robe did he ask for it no free so what he got the best robe is free what else my brother Angel the best robe three and put it on him and put a ring on his hand did he ask for it no free and shoes on his feet did he ask for it no this is free shoes free he didn't even claim it he found himself unworthy are we together amen and then verse uh 23 and bring here the FED calf the father didn't say bring here one of the FED C he said the FED Cal so that Cal was already there it's a specific Cal everybody knows that it's a big one are we together when they were feeding the oxes and everything everybody could tell there is a calf that is special a juicy calf a big one a fatted one when everybody want to even come and buy those C they always envy that one amen you want to use but from there okay give me one second it's going to be called lamps meeting and it's uh slide 951 somebody say ouch amen amen somebody say ouch that's exactly where we heading my friend amen we found out that the calf was a fatted one it was not any calf but de calf defaed one yes amen so this calf was alive that's right are we together until the son came back are we together when the son was away the calf was still alive in other words the sacrifice of the sin of this boy was already a home even when he left are we together but he was never killed because he have to express the second nature [Music] first amen are we together remember there is two nature there is a divine nature are we together and there is an Earthly nature amen so before we left home from the father are we together the sacrifice was already there are we together and the sacrifice waited until we fully manifest [Music] sin are we together When sin is manifested to its top and we are coming home then it was the time to kill the FED Cal that's right what I'm trying to say is the sacrifice already [Music] existed amen but he could not be killed until we come back amen amen he was not a calf that was killed and kept we clear he was a calf that was kept until we come back and he have to be killed fresh are we together so this killing is a fresh killing we together it's freshly killed with blood it's a bleeding sacrifice are we together amen glory to God I got to read brother brandham so bear with me so I can pull this up I don't have any choice it's going to work am glory to God is that from you okay because he popped up quickly bear with me I can preach from the computer but I want you to read what I'm reading I want you to see what I'm saying he even work this morning but devil it's going to work you afraid it's going to work too late it is going to work oh glory to God so put your timer [Laughter] off so don't count those minute for technical issue Oh Glory to God God it's just a heavy material praise God if not I have to remove couple slides okay one two you work on it if you catch up we move on that's no problem amen so the fresh kill and the blood we found out on last Sunday that's the the priesthood or the the levitical priesthood amen am Taps the Brad amen and for the sin offering of the priesthood because the Brad according to Peter is a royal priesthood or a holy priesthood are we together and according to the scripture the offering the sin offering of the Brad or the priesthood is a young Bullock or a cal we clear with that one then we found out that when it comes to Israel as a congregation or the people of Israel or the congregation of Israel amen their sin offering was a kid yes right amen amen which we call a goat amen now if we come to the case of ignorance are we together then the offering of the congregation and the offering of the priesthood are the same that's right right amen but if you notice the priesthood offering doesn't change the offering that changes is the offering of Israel as a congregation so when it come to the case of ignorance both the Brad amen and Israel get the same sin offering which is a bulock or a c amen so the one who changes atonement is not the Brad the Brad atonement remain the same are we together but the one that changes the atonement is Israel if the sin of ignorance is placed on Israel and somebody comes and make Israel know their sin then Israel will move are we together from an old atonement follow me my friend of a goat Amen in to a new atonement are we together of a new atonement of a calf but what is new for Israel it's old for the Brad amen it is an atonement that always has been there for the Brad but it was never expressed to Israel are we together and when this atonement of Cal was given unto the bride or the priesthood we found out that the sin of Aaron amen was a golden calf that's right in other words God anticipated on the sin of Aaron before Aaron even sin are we together because the golden because the calf offering was given to Aaron before he produced the calf so God pre L already worked and provided the sacrifice before sin was expressed are we together and we found out that in our life before we were born because God say in Roman that I love Jacob and I hated es God loved Jacob before Jacob was born amen the Bible say before the children does anything good or bad God already spoke I love Jacob am in other word god already have a sacrifice for Jacob God knew Jacob will lie he knew Jacob is going to teach Che and he knew the message Jacob is going to do so God already provided a sacrifice so your sacrifice came before you are we together am are we together are we together that's why the Bible say the lamb was slain before the foundation of the world are we together am before you come in your natural realm to experience sin and fall the lamb was already slain that's why God say I say hallelujah that you are God in other words I already provided your in your protection I already have the antidot I already have the solution to your fa before you even fall amen that's why I say you are God in other words you will never lose your Divine position no matter how deep the devil can get you he won't change God declaration he won't change God's statement for you what God Said you going to be you will be [Applause] it are we together this is why brother Bram came up with statement and saying if the Lord send me to Hell brother Bram say that he say I will go to hell loving [Applause] him didn't say I won't go he say I will go to hell but I will still love him are we together how can that love enter in hell are we together because God sent Jesus himself in hell are we together God took Jesus and sent him to hell did Jesus remain in hell so there is no place you can enter that you cannot be rescued amen you are redeemable amen God loves you with a system of redeem [Applause] amen are we together are we together it's like before you leave God God take uh a little a cord and tie on you do you know that the safety cord that they tie on you in case you sleep up and then you're going to hang on the air like this so God already put a cord and left you and say go ahead and that cord can only go so far that's right amen and God determined the length of the Cod and once the code reach its [Applause] limitation father help me up Hallelujah uh brother Robert if you go on the back there where there is uh where we put the church edges there is a cord there can you bring me that cord pleas oh my God Amen all is well my friend if you gathered from the back you let me know if you gathered from the back you projected amen am glory to God God will do what he wanted to do that's right amen okay this is a Cod here Amen brother polycarp Jr come I don't know how far this one goes because it looks like it's two cords okay let's keep this one in order are we together can you sit down my friend can everybody see him yes get the cord we clear yes we clear amen I'm moving from him MH is the cord doing anything to him no follow me carefully my friend it will deliver you are we together I'm moving for him do you see him moving no I keep moving from him do you see him moving no I keep moving away from him oh my God he's going to get lost he's now smoking oh my God he's now in jail do you see the Cod moving no watch this what happened to the Cod stops now the Cod begin to make signal I don't know if you get me I don't know when you get me I I don't know when you get me when I was going I was pulling nothing I was pulling myself but when I got to the end with the Cod the Cod begin to make a tag to the one who hold it so if I try to push more it begin to awaken God like this is the time this is the time this is the time this is the time this is the time I don't know if you get it thank you very much I don't know if you get it so God as as I was moving from here God is sleeping as I'm going here God is sleeping when I reach the end of the cord my Cod begin to become a tag from God in other words he begin to tell the Redeemer this is the time to rescue me then God awaken and say wait a minute where are you at you far off there now it's time to come back because there is a security Cod that has been put in you there is a Divine C that was put in you that when you were born God took a Cod and plac it in you it is the predestinated seed cord as far as you can go from God it depends on how far you can go some will go two M some will go Five Mile but at the end once he stop he bring the SE back in other word the more you begin to move you are disturbing God and God realize it's time to pick you up so you can never be lost amen hallelujah hallelujah God put a sage on you because he knew you going to fall amen amen that's why God doesn't pan I amen because he knows what he has done when the devil is bragging God is just watching after a while he said keep on bragging and then before you know it you are delivered from something you never thought you can come out of it it's not you delivering yourself it is God pulling you back amen it is God pulling you back and suddenly from here there is no more smoking there is no more lying there is no more cheating there is no and you say how am I getting away from this somebody is pulling you the love of God in your heart is pulling you back to himself [Applause] amen are we together are we together last Sunday we talk about

have no power over her body her body belong to the husband your body cannot be shared with anyone I I I don't know if we together only your band get access to that who are you if God is giving you access to his [Applause] body I don't know if you getting because the message of the hour brother Bram say it is the unfailing body body body word of the son of man so the son of man gave you his body

other word people may know me people may know me but not like my wife people may know Jesus Christ but you the way you know Jesus Christ is different than anyone amen are we together are we together that's the reason why the Bible is changing for you you knowing the Deep things of the [Applause] Bible are we together are we together are we together so the message God gave you are we together he tells you who you are the food you getting tells you how much God value [Applause] you let me read this my friend this is different than everything I prepare let me read this my friend my friend I don't know if it started here it's when I pulled C that's when he went out in the message I'm going to give you the reference because I don't have it on a computer in the message the results of decision preaching 1955 October the 8th paragraph 12 I'm going to repeat it again the result of decision preaching 1955 October the8th paragraph 12 the Bible says brother Bram say you have fine ministers all through here who are preacher they can preach the gospel to you just going back but just going back as he was like a Sunday school lesson and I am a prospector brother Bram is calling himself a prospector follow me my friend he say you didn't know that did you he said yeah I go down in the Bible and dig up these gems let me make sure because you won't say you didn't get my accent these gems amen and dig up these gems and clean them off a little you know look at them and I like to dig in the book of Exodus amen because you find plenty game in there amen amen and if you happen to look every one of them was cheap off of the Lord Jesus in other word brother Bram say when I when I dig dig dig when I pull back I see Christ when I pull back I see Christ when I pull back I see Christ that's why brother Bram say if you read the Bible and you don't see Christ in every scripture you read the Bible wrong you must see Jesus Christ completely because Jesus is the whole revelation of God are we together remember when he dig he sees who when he dig he sees who Christ so Christ is in many places yet it one Christ no problem my friend in the message perfect Faith preaching 1963 in uh August the 25th in the evening paragraph 32 brother brandham say now these are real deep lessons these are deep amen they are deep lessons amen am he says and I shall catch I shall catch the top of it follow me my friend then you dig down in [Applause] it I wish this projector was working my friend I wish this projector was working amen this is the problem with minister in the message let me read it again brother Bram say in paragraph 32 now these are real deep lessons and I brother Bram will catch the top of it right are we together then you dig down in it that's why brother Bram could not preach every verse in the Bible what brother Bram did he opened the lead for us are we together when brother Bram opened the lead it is US minister to get inside and begin to dig [Applause] this message is not superficial this message was given to be digging we are repeating the prophet repeating the tap by digging into the tap if not your church won't be stable it will be an evangelic church but it's not really seated founded on the solid foundation that's right are we together are we together are we together so will Marion Bram this is why when we go to mered Caple meeting your mind is blown because when you read brother Bram you T something when we read in a in in a in a married couple with you you begin to see something else because brother Bram only open the lead and all I needed was somebody to open the lead once you open and the lead that's say then it's my [Applause] [Music] responsibility listen to me very carefully if this church is locked is sealed you need a code to get in you call Brother set you say brother set you the truste do you have the code and brother set give you the code are you it together and then you go you punch the code and you open the door and you stand right there you will not know what is in this [Music] [Applause] church all you will do is just explain us the door the door look beautiful and then the window look beautiful and then the color look beautiful this is what we have been doing that's not what the message came from message open the lead of the Bible hallu so that when you read the prodal song you need to enter in the prodal S and begin to enter in the bathroom and you enter in the pastor's office and you enter in the S booth and you go to the nursery and you begin to know the structure of the church so there is more to this message that what you hear [Music] are we together are we together I'm sorry y'all but I'm going to say it my friend the level of the deepness that you get married coule is the level of relationship you get Mar do you hear me because you're the one pulling me I'm trying to stay on the line the deeper you get into it it will bring a relationship based on how deep you want to

want to hold hand they hold one another it depends on how deep they [Applause] went let me back up my friend I meet you on March 22nd what I'm trying to say is the deeper you get in Christ the deeper your level of Christianity with Jesus Christ amen until when you talk about the Bible it looks like you you were there when they were riding the Bible how do you know the Bible like this because I'm in deep in dep with the altar me and the altar we dig in let me leave it alone my friend let me come back to the surface my friend brother Bram say I catch the top I catch the surface but it's your responsibility to do what young people young Minister when you read this message dig in [Applause] yes if not you will L you will miss what to preach to the people you going to speak 20 minutes and

represented the years of plenty yes plenty until you don't have any number to put into it until you don't have a stop until you don't have a stop with this revelation we keep preaching it every Sunday it keep coming up it keep coming up it looks like there's no end what are we eating don't worry I will get into that deeply what are we eating have you ever eaten a steak uh-huh yes have you ever seen the part that is connected to the F that is the juiciest one let's go to Judges 13 so I can finish here my friend if you dare you can say amen amen amen amen remember when Gideon brought the first offering I we together it was an offering of kids you remember that he was a kid and the angel of the Lord told Gideon take that offering and put it on the rock you remember that Sunday you remember that Sunday he said put that on the Rock Amen and Gideon took the offering it is so deep here but I cannot get it he say Gideon get the kid or the goat amen and put it on the on the Rock Amen with un Le cake we will get into this next Sunday because I can't get into all of these as Sy he get the kid or the goat and Gideon placed that on the Rock do you follow me and he took the broth yes or the sauce amen and he pour on it I'm going to go to this detail next Sunday you're going to see what go what is hidden in D and brother Bram said that was a drink of off amen I'm going to take all of this next Sunday are we together Lord's willing and he pour that on the meat and on the 11 cake are we together and the angel of the Lord touched with the stuff you remember last Sunday and what happened the flame came out and consumed the meat consume the broth follow me carefully I will get into this one and then consume the broth and consume the cake and the angel of the Lord disappear so the angel of the Lord sanction that offering right he was okay with that offering but if he's okay in the same night this is what the Bible says in the same night God comes again the angel come again and say Gideon go get another offering and built an altar do you follow me yes sir and put that offering on the same Rock that's right are we together but this offering was no longer a kid you remember that suay he was what a cast are we together God suction the all atonement yes sir amen but he didn't stop there he moved Gideon from the old atonement onto the new one are we together because the one who said to offer a kid was God right are we together but the time came that the offering has to be changed so you got to move toward the new offering what are you trying to say this is why brother Bram could not deny Luther [Applause] are we together FL attend and prepare for for landing this is why brother brother could not deny wle because he was God at that time he sanctioned them he he acknowledged them he recognized them he recognized Wesley he recognized Pentecost but that's not our offering that is not our message that's why the people that have a problem when brother Bram is coding this and this and this and this and say what is you are a Smith and everything everything that was God before even in portion brother Bram have to say Amen to that but that is not our day message we got to move from Luther from West from Pentecost to a fresh [Applause] skill are we together so we cannot C with Smith wigger here we cannot CAU Mountain Luther here we have already moved father you CAU what is present what have blood and life if not you going to miss God are we together are we together are we together you hear preacher okay Charles Spurgeon say wait a minute we sanction him for his time not this [Applause] time Wesley was good for that time not this time this time we need a seven years old Bullock a pull up that TR seven ches but was never kill a message that was going all along but God could not give it to anyone the message that God hid from Paul that he hid from arenus that he hid from colba that he hi from everyone else he's going to give it to you because the giving of God is showing you who you are the giving of God tells you who you are what you have with stand seven years of faming the bible say that the philistin I mean the people of the the Amal destroy everything why they could not destroy that one amen amen they came the first year they never catch that one they destroyed the second year they never destroy that one the third year nothing the fourth all the way to the sixth where was that Cal hidden amen until he he escaped the devil that's right amen but he was kept for an atonement are we together are we together let me seal this here because we got to go home go to Judges chapter 3 let me finish here oh God praise God Judges chapter 3 uh chapter 6 I'm sorry if you thereare you can say amen amen judg 6 amen you there amen verse 25 and then I'm going to finish I'm 4 minute over so let me nail this you there amen verse 25 and he came to pass which night the same night that the Lord said to him take your father's

we meet you next Sunday it's loaded here why the second one okay but let's just keep it okay but let's see what the second is he said so there was a first bulock amen and a second one God say don't touch the first amen touch the second Bullock but the second Bullock have a mystery what is the mystery the Bible says take take the second bulock of what seven years old the second bulock have 7 years old which is the time of the punishment of Israel the seven years that God was punishing Israel amen so when God follow me when God before God started to punish Israel for his sin amen God send a cal yes sir I don't know if you get I don't know if you get so the calf was already there before the punishing St right I don't know if we together so there was a cow that was pregnant but that cow could not deliver only when God begin to punish Israel when the first year of punishment start the cow delivered are we together the atonement came yes the atonement was there before the trouble start I don't know if you get it before the devil begin to BFF you there was an atonement because remember these people of the East only got one objective they didn't kill the Jews they only came to make them miserable are we together the trial of job never killed him yes sir he only made him miserable and every year they only come to destroy they increase and go back in other word it looks like a paycheck comes in I'm going to go out my friend amen and something comes out and take the paycheck and the trouble doesn't go until the paycheck is finished when the paycheck is finished all trouble goes back everything is going well no more sickness at home no children are sick everything is working good until next Friday are we together it's a circle that continues but remember before the

B rain in the house of Gideon father for seven years without being touched I'm going to come back next Sunday I'm saying that I know what I'm where I'm going are we together are we together but the solution to B was already born I don't know if you get what I'm saying let me start it again before B enter into this house amen a cal was born and everybody thought he was an ordinary C amen amen but they didn't know it was God's solution amen amen if I say this will he shock you I'm just trying to make a point will he shock you maybe he was born in [Applause] Kentucky put that on me put that on me and everybody thought he was an ordinary man but he was a [Applause] solution are we there and the Cal begin to grow without without hammering anything and B was prevailing for first year 7 years all the way no problem then God comes he said get that Cal the one that was born right from the beginning and fulfill seven years so it's a cal that have all the suffering into it what do you do with that Cal he say look at your fathers he has bear what do you do yes are we together verse uh 25 and throw down the what the altar of who that your father has and cut down the Grove that is by it the Grove is a secret it's a sacred tree yes are we together you take the calf and as you taking the calf are we together it destroys B Gideon all this time didn't have power to destroy Bell that's right are we together the power of destruction of bell was hidden in the calf are we together take the calf and throw down Bell seven years this thing has been here throw down amen amen there was something for 7 years are we together are we together remember the sin of Aon Cal sir idolatry amen uhhuh the Bible says he says verse 26 and build an altar to the Lord your God upon the top of what are we together now the rock that first have the kid now he has the the calf are we together and in the ordered place and take the second bulock and offer a what a burn sacrifice with the wood of the Grove which you shall do what so the Two element of idolatry are we together B The Altar and the Grove that were there were destroyed at the end of The Seven Year and when it was destroyed you take the wood from that idolatry and put it there and the sacrifice will go on top of it yes so this sacrifice have the power of destruction of Bell right are we together the Bell that made Israel suffer the Bell that brought God wrath upon Israel for seven years amen there was a sacrifice to take care of that thing but that sacrifice could not come only at the end of The Seven Year so the offering of the seven year amen has a solution to anything that trouble you in your home that's it are we together anything that trouble you in your home have a solution the solution is in a calf a calf of seven years a calf that iscap all the years that is where you found your solution that Cal will give you power to destroy Bell he will give you power to remove idolatry from your home because Gideon have a
