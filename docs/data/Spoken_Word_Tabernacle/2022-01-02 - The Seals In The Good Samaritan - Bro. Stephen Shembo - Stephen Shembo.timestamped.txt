[14:33] feet fall
[14:35] i'd have to go back to quote it
[14:36] correctly but it had to do with you know
[14:40] him walking with god
[14:42] and he just didn't want any of the
[14:44] enemies to interfere with his walk
[14:47] remain standing with me for just one

[44:56] so
[44:58] let's see how tom
[45:00] will help me
[45:01] but
[45:03] if you didn't read revelation 6
[45:06] then really really stay awake
[45:10] matthew 9 verse 9 if you're there you
[45:13] can say amen amen hallelujah amen
[45:17] and as jesus passed
[45:19] forth from there
[45:21] he saw a man named matthew we read this
[45:23] on wednesday
[45:25] sitting at the receipt of custom
[45:27] in other words the tax office
[45:30] and he says to him follow me
[45:33] and he arose and follow him
[45:36] amen
[45:38] and he come to pass he came to pass as
[45:40] jesus sat at meat in the house
[45:43] behold
[45:45] few publicans
[45:47] okay you might be seated somebody's
[45:49] awake
[45:51] amen
[45:52] many publicans and sinners
[45:56] came and sat down with him and his
[45:58] disciple
[46:00] publicans were not good people
[46:03] and when the pharisees saw it
[46:06] they say to his disciple why eat your
[46:09] master
[46:10] with publicans and sinners
[46:13] but when jesus heard that
[46:15] he said to them
[46:17] they that behold in other words they
[46:20] that are healthy
[46:22] need not a physician
[46:24] but they that are
[46:26] sick so jesus himself presents himself
[46:30] here as a doctor
[46:34] amen
[46:36] jesus is a physician
[46:39] the great physician right here jesus is
[46:41] a doctor amen
[46:44] but
[46:44] go you and learn
[46:47] what that mean
[46:48] i have mercy
[46:50] and not sacrifice
[46:54] this physician is emphasizing on mercy
[46:58] amen
[47:00] versus
[47:01] sacrifice
[47:02] who was offering sacrifice in the old
[47:05] testament
[47:07] the priest
[47:09] in other words the levitical priesthood
[47:15] amen everybody
[47:18] amen
[47:19] he's the one that introduced the
[47:21] priesthood
[47:22] but when he came to a certain point he
[47:24] say i prefer mercy
[47:27] versus the levitical priesthood amen
[47:30] and not sacrifice
[47:32] for i am not come to call the righteous
[47:36] but sinners to repentance everybody
[47:40] clear
[47:41] let's go to look 10.
[47:43] let's see if we can get to this
[47:45] samaritan this morning
[47:49] still a lot of folks out
[47:51] beginning of the year
[47:55] amen amen
[47:59] verse
[48:02] 30. if you're there you can say
[48:04] amen and jesus answering say
[48:09] a certain man
[48:12] went down
[48:13] from jerusalem
[48:15] to jericho
[48:17] there is a man who was in jerusalem
[48:23] and he was going down
[48:25] marquette
[48:27] toward jericho
[48:29] if he was leaving jerusalem
[48:32] toward jericho he was in a journey
[48:37] amen
[48:40] hallelujah
[48:43] and fell among thieves
[48:48] so this road is the first
[48:50] infested with thieves
[48:55] and fell among thieves
[48:58] which one stripped him of his reign man
[49:02] so when this man left jerusalem he was
[49:04] fully dressed
[49:06] amen
[49:12] in jerusalem
[49:14] this man was fully dressed
[49:17] amen
[49:18] he had his robe on
[49:20] amen
[49:21] but when the thief met him
[49:24] the first thing they did
[49:26] was to remove his clothes
[49:29] what was in the clothing that they were
[49:31] looking for
[49:33] the first
[49:34] action of a thief was to take his
[49:37] arraignment
[49:39] ever here
[49:40] or his
[49:42] clothing or his robe
[49:46] off of him
[49:48] that's what it's 15. you need to stay
[49:51] really awake because we're going to dig
[49:53] really deep
[49:54] amen
[49:56] okay i'm warning you
[49:59] and he fell among thieves which stripped
[50:02] his
[50:03] of his redment
[50:05] they never beat him first
[50:06] before they beat him
[50:08] they first removed his remnant
[50:10] the remnant that he had in jerusalem
[50:14] number one they removed his woman
[50:16] so in other words he's a man now without
[50:19] clothing
[50:20] everybody
[50:21] amen
[50:22] hallelujah
[50:24] and
[50:26] wounded him
[50:29] the second thing that the thief did
[50:33] they went into a physical assault
[50:46] at first they didn't warn them they just
[50:47] remove the clothes off
[50:49] once the first step is over the second
[50:51] one then they get into the physical amen
[50:55] and wounded him come out
[50:57] and departed
[51:01] number three they departed
[51:04] but when they departed how did they lift
[51:06] him
[51:08] a half dead right
[51:11] remember this
[51:13] you remember that right
[51:15] so one part was already dead
[51:18] amen
[51:19] was dead
[51:21] and there was a part that is alive
[51:24] so he was half dead
[51:26] what does he mean
[51:28] amen
[51:30] verse 31 and by chance
[51:33] they came
[51:34] down a certain priest that way
[51:38] so not only was he the one traveling
[51:40] there is a priest
[51:42] that came
[51:44] you need all this detail
[51:46] because when i begin to dig if you miss
[51:49] it it's a problem
[51:50] and by chance there came down a certain
[51:53] priest that way and when he saw him he
[51:56] passed by on the other side
[51:59] amen and likewise a lever when he was at
[52:03] the place came and looked on him and
[52:06] pass on the other side now you know now
[52:09] based on what we built
[52:11] a levat and a priest represented what
[52:15] which priesthood
[52:23] if you don't get something when you're
[52:26] in the service especially young men
[52:28] young people when you go home play the
[52:30] sermon over again
[52:32] amen
[52:34] that's how we learn
[52:36] verse 33
[52:37] but a certain samaritan
[52:42] that same road
[52:44] this man
[52:45] thief
[52:46] priest levat
[52:48] and a samaritan
[52:52] a busy road
[52:55] and a certain samaritan
[52:58] as he did water
[53:02] so the samaritan also was journeying
[53:07] if you look on him here you will see him
[53:09] walking
[53:12] amen
[53:14] as he journeyed amen amen
[53:18] came where he was
[53:20] and when he saw him he had compassion on
[53:24] him from wednesday you understand what
[53:26] compassion is right
[53:29] the greatest key with this man
[53:31] is compassion
[53:37] help your children
[53:39] verse 34 and went to him and barred him
[53:43] and burned up his wounds
[53:46] the wound that was inflicted
[53:48] by the thieves
[53:50] pouring in
[53:52] oil and water
[53:54] so when he came
[53:56] he was binding his wound
[53:58] by using oil
[54:01] and wine
[54:04] to take care of the wounds
[54:09] amen
[54:10] [Music]
[54:12] and set him on his own beast
[54:16] not somebody else beast he didn't borrow
[54:18] one
[54:22] he got a beast so he took the man and
[54:25] put him on the beast so the man was no
[54:27] longer working
[54:29] the beast was working for him
[54:33] over here the man was walking
[54:35] after a while they put him on the beach
[54:36] beast the beast continued the journey
[54:40] hey mark here
[54:41] amen a certain his own beast come out
[54:44] and brought him to and in
[54:47] he brought him to an inner
[54:50] wish i have a bigger board
[54:52] he brought him to an inn and took care
[54:54] of him
[54:55] that's between him
[54:57] and
[54:58] the man that was wounded that was
[55:03] toward the evening time we already spoke
[55:05] about it amen then on the next day
[55:09] are we okay
[55:11] he changed
[55:13] gears amen amen
[55:15] and on the morrow
[55:17] when he departed the good samaritan
[55:20] he took out two pences
[55:23] two pence
[55:24] and gave to the host
[55:27] so on the first day
[55:28] he's the one ministering
[55:31] and when he's ministering he's showing
[55:34] compassion
[55:35] amen taking care of the wound pouring
[55:38] oil and wine he's doing a certain work
[55:41] amen
[55:42] but
[55:43] on the next day amen
[55:46] amen on a different day
[55:48] [Music]
[55:49] he switched the ministry to a host
[55:53] amen we okay amen
[55:56] we okay
[55:58] normally he was the one that have to
[56:00] finish that ministry
[56:06] do you hear me
[56:08] do you hear me
[56:10] he was when he started something he
[56:13] needed to finish it
[56:16] okay
[56:17] he was the one that have to take care of
[56:20] the man all the way up
[56:22] but he cannot do it all himself
[56:25] he came in
[56:27] did a certain work
[56:29] but he passed the baton to somebody
[56:33] anybody
[56:35] ever here in other words what he was
[56:38] supposed to do himself
[56:40] now it is done
[56:42] through somebody else
[56:46] [Applause]
[56:53] that person is called a host
[56:56] of the inn amen
[56:58] so the host of the inn took his place
[57:03] [Music]
[57:05] here
[57:05] so what the host of the inn is doing
[57:08] if you know the good samaritan well you
[57:12] think it's him in the house
[57:19] everybody here
[57:20] because everything the host is doing is
[57:23] just what the good samaritan himself
[57:26] was supposed to do
[57:33] ever here
[57:35] so on this day the next day here
[57:38] it is still the good samaritan
[57:42] everybody here
[57:44] right here it's the good samaritan
[57:47] everybody
[57:49] the only difference is the vessels are
[57:52] different
[57:59] it is the same man
[58:01] it's the same ministry
[58:06] everybody here it's only changed from
[58:09] one person to another
[58:10] [Music]
[58:12] amen amen
[58:13] you see why you need to put your head in
[58:15] the world
[58:16] [Music]
[58:19] you see now
[58:20] amen
[58:21] and say to him take care of him
[58:24] and whatsoever you spend more
[58:27] he gave him two pence
[58:29] amen
[58:30] two parents and he gave him an ability
[58:33] to
[58:35] expand more into his account
[58:42] anybody here
[58:43] and that man have a right to go in the
[58:45] bank account
[58:47] amen and pull certain things
[58:50] he can pull a money that you never seen
[58:53] before
[58:58] all right
[59:00] whatsoever you spend more
[59:02] when i come again
[59:05] so the good samaritan will come again
[59:11] in other words he will return
[59:18] for the second time when he come again i
[59:22] will repay you
[59:24] which now of these three
[59:27] thank you was neighbor
[59:30] if i get to that word naval to him that
[59:33] fell among fists
[59:35] and he said he that show water
[59:39] remember jesus say i desire water
[59:43] so the good samaritan showed mercy
[59:47] i desire mercy who does show mercy on
[59:50] him
[59:51] then say jesus to him go and do likewise
[59:56] in other words i want you also
[59:58] to be
[59:59] like that
[1:00:01] amen
[1:00:03] let's go now to the last one it's in 2nd
[1:00:07] thessalonian chapter 2.
[1:00:10] new year changing gears

[1:00:34] now we beseech you brethren verse 1 by
[1:00:38] the coming of our lord
[1:00:42] here
[1:00:42] jesus christ and by our gathering
[1:00:46] together to him remember shallow
[1:00:48] that's where everybody should gather
[1:00:51] that you should that
[1:00:53] you be not soon shaken in mind or be
[1:00:56] trouble
[1:00:57] neither by spirit nor by word nor by
[1:01:01] letter as from us
[1:01:03] as that day of christ is at hand
[1:01:06] anybody care in other words don't let
[1:01:09] anybody
[1:01:10] upset you that i hate that day is at
[1:01:13] hand
[1:01:14] what is it what what paul is trying to
[1:01:17] say
[1:01:18] i thought we should tell the people
[1:01:20] the coming of the lord is coming the
[1:01:22] lord is coming that's true but paul is
[1:01:24] trying to point out something verse 3
[1:01:27] let no man deceive you by any means
[1:01:30] for that day
[1:01:32] the coming of the lord
[1:01:34] shall not come
[1:01:36] except there come a water
[1:01:39] all that paul is saying is before you
[1:01:42] really really really really get
[1:01:45] very
[1:01:47] taken up to the coming of the lord
[1:01:49] you will see a sun coming out
[1:01:52] that sun is there will be a falling away
[1:01:55] as soon as you see it falling away then
[1:01:58] if you are sleeping out of church you
[1:02:00] need to wake up
[1:02:04] it's a signal that i am really coming
[1:02:07] now anybody here they will come and
[1:02:09] falling away first karma
[1:02:12] and that man of who
[1:02:15] be water
[1:02:17] if the man of sin is revealed that means
[1:02:20] he was hidden
[1:02:23] amen
[1:02:26] so there is a man of sin
[1:02:29] and that man of sin has been hidden
[1:02:32] or he has been sealed
[1:02:35] [Music]
[1:02:37] america
[1:02:38] he has been hidden
[1:02:40] and paul is saying
[1:02:42] if you really want to know that god is
[1:02:45] really at hand ever here
[1:02:48] the man of sin
[1:02:50] must be revealed
[1:02:53] everybody here in other words they must
[1:02:56] break the seal
[1:03:00] to reveal to you
[1:03:02] the man of sin
[1:03:03] [Music]
[1:03:06] amen
[1:03:07] come on everybody here
[1:03:09] the man of sin
[1:03:11] be with you come on the son of war
[1:03:17] this man of sin
[1:03:18] the bible is calling him the son
[1:03:22] of water
[1:03:24] who was the son of perdition
[1:03:28] judas
[1:03:29] did paul met judas
[1:03:32] i thought judas was dead
[1:03:37] am i reading a different bible
[1:03:39] when jesus betrayed the lord jesus
[1:03:41] christ
[1:03:42] he went they gave him money finally he
[1:03:45] found out that what he did was wrong he
[1:03:47] went back and gave the money away and
[1:03:50] did what hang himself judah was the son
[1:03:53] of perdition that's what the scripture
[1:03:55] said you need that scripture again i
[1:03:57] spoke about it many times you see me i'm
[1:03:59] gonna give it to you judas was the son
[1:04:02] of what perdition and judas was already
[1:04:05] dead when jesus christ was dead
[1:04:08] how do we again reveal judah over again
[1:04:16] everybody here
[1:04:18] and they say that that judah was the man
[1:04:21] of sin
[1:04:22] that's why brother branham said judah
[1:04:24] was the devil incarnated
[1:04:29] he never gave you scripture
[1:04:32] make sense
[1:04:34] so the vessel is not the man judah
[1:04:36] really it's who was inside of judah
[1:04:40] about here because you can remove judah
[1:04:43] but the judah is there
[1:04:46] let me help somebody else because
[1:04:48] you are alert now it's good everybody
[1:04:51] here
[1:04:52] elijah come five times
[1:04:55] the original elijah is in heaven
[1:04:58] ever here but the spirit of elijah can
[1:05:02] come upon somebody else but it's still
[1:05:05] elijah
[1:05:09] are we okay now
[1:05:10] are we okay now
[1:05:12] so when they say elijah has come brother
[1:05:15] branham is elijah if you look it's
[1:05:17] william marion branham but it's larger
[1:05:21] [Applause]
[1:05:24] it is not the same elijah of the old
[1:05:27] testament
[1:05:28] but it's still a larger by the anointing
[1:05:33] by the spirit
[1:05:35] by the ministry
[1:05:37] anybody okay because judah was already
[1:05:40] dead but they say nothing is going to
[1:05:42] happen until they reveal judah
[1:05:46] so judah was sealed
[1:05:48] [Music]
[1:05:52] amen
[1:05:54] verse 4 who opposes and exalt himself
[1:05:59] above all that is called god
[1:06:02] or that is worship
[1:06:04] who did that
[1:06:07] who did that in heaven
[1:06:10] he wanna
[1:06:11] go everybody here
[1:06:12] so that he as god
[1:06:15] sits in the temple of god showing
[1:06:18] himself that he is
[1:06:21] remember you not that when i was yet
[1:06:23] with you i told you these things
[1:06:26] and now you know that
[1:06:29] you know what we fold
[1:06:31] that he might be revealed in his water
[1:06:34] so paul is saying here that there is
[1:06:37] something that is blocking
[1:06:40] the revelation of judah
[1:06:43] not the revelation of judah at the first
[1:06:46] coming
[1:06:48] but the revelation of judah at the
[1:06:50] second coming before the lord jesus
[1:06:53] christ come
[1:06:54] and paul is saying there is something
[1:06:56] that is blocking
[1:06:58] that revelation amen
[1:07:00] and paul explained that
[1:07:02] it is um verse
[1:07:06] 6 and now you know what we
[1:07:08] what withhold that he might be revealed
[1:07:11] in water
[1:07:13] paul is saying that there is a time
[1:07:15] appointed for the revelation of judah
[1:07:19] before the coming of the lord in other
[1:07:22] words paul is saying that this unfolding
[1:07:25] of the man of sin this unfolding of the
[1:07:28] son of perdition this unfolding of judah
[1:07:31] is specified to a time
[1:07:34] anybody care in other words until that
[1:07:37] time arrive
[1:07:39] you cannot
[1:07:41] really
[1:07:42] understand
[1:07:44] the man of sin
[1:07:47] did you get it if that time is not yet
[1:07:50] in other words if god say at 12 o'clock
[1:07:54] the man of sin will be revealed you can
[1:07:56] try at eight o'clock
[1:07:59] you can try at nine o'clock you can try
[1:08:02] and even eleven o'clock you can even try
[1:08:06] at 11 50 55
[1:08:09] you can even try at 11 59 you won't get
[1:08:13] the correct revelation of judah
[1:08:16] but once it's 12 o'clock
[1:08:21] there is nothing in hell
[1:08:23] nothing on the earth
[1:08:25] nothing in heaven that can block the
[1:08:28] fulfillment of that revelation
[1:08:31] automatically there will be an anointing
[1:08:33] coming up
[1:08:34] to unfold and reveal who judah is really
[1:08:39] anybody here
[1:08:40] hallelujah
[1:08:41] [Music]
[1:08:42] verse 7
[1:08:43] for the mystery of water
[1:08:46] that's already water
[1:08:48] paul is saying that he's already working
[1:08:52] but you would not understand him very
[1:08:54] good
[1:08:56] because he's hidden
[1:08:58] you got to wait till the time that we
[1:09:00] explain you really how he operates
[1:09:03] then when you see that time jesus is not
[1:09:06] far away
[1:09:09] so and
[1:09:11] so the mystery of iniquity does already
[1:09:13] work in the time of paul
[1:09:16] only he
[1:09:18] who now lets
[1:09:20] amen
[1:09:21] we let and the one who's doing that is
[1:09:23] god i will explain you later
[1:09:26] until he be taken out of the way
[1:09:30] anybody here everybody here
[1:09:33] there is somebody
[1:09:35] that is controlling
[1:09:36] that ministry anybody care
[1:09:39] but there will come there will come a
[1:09:41] time
[1:09:42] that the one who have supreme control
[1:09:45] will be taken out
[1:09:48] yes amen in other words god is here
[1:09:53] back here and he's watching everything
[1:09:56] and back here but there will come a time
[1:09:59] that god will be taken out
[1:10:03] everybody
[1:10:05] the rapture
[1:10:07] is really the removing of the holy
[1:10:10] spirit
[1:10:11] from the gentile
[1:10:16] do you hear me
[1:10:18] do you hear me
[1:10:19] do you remember the 10th virgin
[1:10:21] they were looking for water
[1:10:23] oil amen
[1:10:25] so when god is coming as a big magnet
[1:10:28] he's just sucking the holy spirit out
[1:10:32] and back here
[1:10:33] do you follow me
[1:10:34] and if you have the holy ghost
[1:10:38] do you follow me
[1:10:39] when they are pulling your holy ghost
[1:10:42] you're not staying here
[1:10:44] they are pulling you and the holy ghost
[1:10:48] [Music]
[1:10:51] do you follow me
[1:10:53] this is a border
[1:10:56] again another border okay
[1:10:59] i take this water out
[1:11:01] i take a big magnet and i put it inside
[1:11:04] this bottle back here if i bring another
[1:11:07] magnet here
[1:11:09] do you follow me
[1:11:10] the magnet is attracting the magnet that
[1:11:13] is inside the bottom amen and you will
[1:11:15] see that magnet begin to go up
[1:11:18] and back here and but when it's going up
[1:11:21] the border won't stay there
[1:11:23] do you follow me the bottle also is
[1:11:25] going up
[1:11:29] do you hear me so when they see that's
[1:11:32] why when the holy ghost enters into you
[1:11:34] it seals you
[1:11:36] in other words the holy ghost cannot
[1:11:38] leave you anymore in other words the
[1:11:40] holy ghost is blocking you
[1:11:43] ever here even if the holy ghost want to
[1:11:46] go out he cannot go out anymore
[1:11:49] but here if you move the holy ghost is
[1:11:51] moving with you if you go to the left
[1:11:53] the holy ghost is going to the land so
[1:11:55] if they've kicked you out
[1:12:00] [Applause]
[1:12:02] everybody here
[1:12:03] so he that is blocking will be taken out
[1:12:07] ever here once they suck the holy ghost
[1:12:10] out
[1:12:11] then the antichrist have a free highway
[1:12:17] so you are the one that is slowing him
[1:12:20] down
[1:12:24] when the angel came down in revelation
[1:12:26] 10
[1:12:27] he put one foot away
[1:12:30] and one foot where
[1:12:32] according to revelation 13 what comes on
[1:12:34] the earth
[1:12:37] there is a beast what comes from the
[1:12:38] water
[1:12:40] why is that angel blocking them here
[1:12:42] because john is here
[1:12:45] and back here that's why he's blocking
[1:12:47] them
[1:12:48] the day he removed his foot like this
[1:12:52] then you will really get it
[1:12:54] so don't stay here
[1:12:56] you need to go to heaven
[1:12:59] don't stay on this earth
[1:13:01] don't stay on this earth
[1:13:03] because of worldly thing
[1:13:06] you're gonna get them in the tribulation
[1:13:08] right back here verse eight and then
[1:13:10] shut that wicked one after he is removed
[1:13:14] everybody
[1:13:15] after they suck the holy spirit out
[1:13:18] then the wicked one the man of sin amen
[1:13:22] then that wicked one be water
[1:13:25] this is a second revelation now the
[1:13:27] first they are explaining you who is
[1:13:30] but this one when they take the holy
[1:13:33] ghost out he's really manifested plainly
[1:13:38] he's not playing games with you anymore
[1:13:40] anybody here and the wicked won't be
[1:13:42] revealed or manifested
[1:13:44] whom the lord shall consume
[1:13:47] everybody here
[1:13:48] with the spirit of his water
[1:13:51] remember in revelation 19 the lord is
[1:13:55] coming back again on the third coming
[1:13:58] and out of his mouth comes what
[1:14:00] the sword of the spirit which is the
[1:14:04] so after we go up
[1:14:07] somebody is fully manifested until the
[1:14:11] third coming when god is coming to
[1:14:13] destroy him
[1:14:15] first second third coming right here in
[1:14:17] the scripture and back here and then
[1:14:20] shall the wicked one be revealed whom
[1:14:22] the lord shall consume with the spirit
[1:14:25] of his mouth there is a word there is a
[1:14:27] sword coming up everybody here
[1:14:29] and shall destroy with the brightness of
[1:14:32] his water this is the third coming this
[1:14:35] is no longer the fourth coming
[1:14:37] back here
[1:14:39] verse 9 even him who's coming is after
[1:14:44] the working of who
[1:14:46] so you understand the man of sin now
[1:14:48] that's why he's a judah uh satan with
[1:14:51] all power and son and lying wonders and
[1:14:54] with all deceivableness
[1:14:57] of unrighteousness in them that perish
[1:15:01] why do they perish come on because they
[1:15:04] receive not the water
[1:15:06] the love of the truth that they might be
[1:15:08] water
[1:15:09] so to be safe you must have water
[1:15:13] that's why you love the world
[1:15:14] [Applause]
[1:15:15] [Music]
[1:15:17] if you don't love the world something is
[1:15:18] wrong
[1:15:21] here you must have the love of the truth
[1:15:23] for you to be saved so not everybody is
[1:15:25] going to be saved
[1:15:27] amen
[1:15:29] all right let's pray
[1:15:31] heavenly father
[1:15:32] lord we are approaching you again father
[1:15:34] humbly this morning lord thanking you
[1:15:37] for your grace for your love and your
[1:15:39] mercy and for everything you have been
[1:15:42] doing for us lord thank you again for
[1:15:44] what you did last year and father you
[1:15:47] have given us an opportunity to gather
[1:15:49] together around the revealed word of the
[1:15:51] hour
[1:15:52] lord i have done what any man that you
[1:15:54] give ability to do can do lord but when
[1:15:57] it comes to interpret your word to give
[1:16:00] a revelation father it's only a work of
[1:16:03] the holy spirit lord this is
[1:16:06] algebra this is a deep things and father
[1:16:10] i'm praying that you forgive your
[1:16:12] children for anything that they have
[1:16:14] done that would hinder them from
[1:16:17] grasping into that revelation
[1:16:19] father may the power of the holy spirit
[1:16:22] come down and break the word in a way
[1:16:25] that it was never done before so that
[1:16:27] they can plainly see jesus christ
[1:16:30] manifested lord and that nobody get lost
[1:16:33] alone father be the alpha and the omega
[1:16:36] we seal the devil completely out of this
[1:16:38] place as we committed all in the name of
[1:16:41] jesus christ
[1:16:42] amen
[1:16:44] you stay awake
[1:16:46] all right we are the high priest in the
[1:16:49] good samaritan
[1:16:51] the purpose of this we talked about the
[1:16:54] priesthood where we have been talking
[1:16:56] about the mystery of the level but we
[1:16:58] want you to look at the good samaritan
[1:17:00] and when you look at the good samaritan
[1:17:03] you see the high priest into him
[1:17:05] ever here
[1:17:06] blessed be the name of the lord it's
[1:17:08] part three when we spoke on wednesday
[1:17:12] we start on this hebrew here
[1:17:16] chapter five verse one
[1:17:18] the bible said for every high priest
[1:17:21] taken from among men
[1:17:22] is so then for man in things pertaining
[1:17:25] to god
[1:17:26] that he may offer both gifted
[1:17:29] sin you already understand this
[1:17:32] but who can have compassion
[1:17:36] on the ignorant and on them that are out
[1:17:39] of the way for that he himself also is
[1:17:43] compassed with infirmities and we found
[1:17:46] out on wednesday
[1:17:47] that compassion is to do the will of god
[1:17:51] compassion brother obama say it's first
[1:17:53] you gotta know the will of god and then
[1:17:56] you gotta do it ever here but to qualify
[1:17:59] as a high priest here paul is saying
[1:18:02] that a high priest must be a human being
[1:18:06] and not only just a human being but a
[1:18:09] human being that is gifted with
[1:18:12] compassion
[1:18:14] compassion to understand the wicked
[1:18:17] people compassion to understand the
[1:18:20] ignorant and compassion to understand
[1:18:22] those that are out of the way
[1:18:25] and we found on wednesday that the law
[1:18:28] of ignorance was already given in the
[1:18:31] old testament and there was one law for
[1:18:34] the jews and one lawful also there
[1:18:37] gentile ever here and we found out that
[1:18:40] even the jews themselves
[1:18:43] were ignorant
[1:18:47] is everybody awake
[1:18:49] we have two groups here
[1:18:51] we have the jews
[1:18:54] and we have the gentiles everybody here
[1:18:59] anybody here
[1:19:00] the jews
[1:19:02] grew up with the law
[1:19:05] amen
[1:19:07] are you there
[1:19:09] the jews when they are born
[1:19:11] their law already existed
[1:19:14] they go to church
[1:19:16] [Music]
[1:19:17] amen
[1:19:20] right by the ebook
[1:19:22] there is a reason why i call him
[1:19:24] right by the evil the jews are born with
[1:19:27] religion
[1:19:28] [Music]
[1:19:31] everybody here
[1:19:32] the jews when they go to church
[1:19:35] they're going to train them
[1:19:37] on religion
[1:19:39] everybody here
[1:19:40] the jews will learn that every sabbath
[1:19:43] we need to be there
[1:19:46] everybody here the jews will learn that
[1:19:48] you must take a lamb and you must do
[1:19:51] this you must do this you must do this
[1:19:54] you must do this they will learn
[1:19:56] everything amen
[1:19:57] the jews were a real jew when you are
[1:20:00] born you cannot fall on the idol at you
[1:20:04] do you follow me
[1:20:06] but yet
[1:20:10] the jew
[1:20:11] were ignorant
[1:20:13] amen
[1:20:14] anybody cared so far
[1:20:16] if you ask the jew about the lord they
[1:20:19] can tell you about it
[1:20:21] back here that's why the rich young
[1:20:24] ruler
[1:20:26] are we okay
[1:20:27] when he came to jesus christ
[1:20:30] he was showing jesus christ
[1:20:32] that i never been in a nightclub
[1:20:36] [Applause]
[1:20:38] i never smoke
[1:20:41] i never drink
[1:20:43] i never prostitute myself all my life i
[1:20:46] grew up
[1:20:48] in the strict way
[1:20:50] as a message believer
[1:20:54] my father was a jew
[1:20:57] my mother was a jew
[1:20:59] and i grew up in the jewish religion
[1:21:02] but despite
[1:21:04] living
[1:21:05] under commandment
[1:21:07] under the law
[1:21:09] i still feel
[1:21:11] that i don't have eternal life
[1:21:15] amen
[1:21:16] everybody here everybody here so there
[1:21:19] was something
[1:21:20] about eternal life that is different
[1:21:24] than religion
[1:21:26] [Applause]
[1:21:28] everybody here
[1:21:29] it is different than just going to
[1:21:31] church
[1:21:32] it is different than just wearing long
[1:21:35] dresses
[1:21:36] it is different than just stopping
[1:21:38] makeup
[1:21:40] it is a very life of god
[1:21:43] in the life of a believer that brings a
[1:21:46] church
[1:21:48] not on the outside but a change on the
[1:21:51] inside
[1:21:53] [Applause]
[1:21:55] ever hear
[1:21:56] everybody here
[1:21:58] but the gentile did not know anything
[1:22:02] [Music]
[1:22:04] in other words there is a difference
[1:22:07] between the ignorance of a jew
[1:22:11] anybody here and the ignorance of a
[1:22:14] gentile
[1:22:18] blessed be the name of the lord
[1:22:20] the very ministry of jesus christ the
[1:22:24] bible say and there was delivered unto
[1:22:27] him the book of the prophet hezei and
[1:22:30] when he had opened the book he found the
[1:22:32] place where he was written
[1:22:34] the spirit of the lord is upon me
[1:22:37] because he has anointed me to do what
[1:22:42] to preach the gospel to the rich
[1:22:46] [Music]
[1:22:49] okay to preach the gospel to the poor he
[1:22:53] has sent me to heal those that are
[1:22:55] healthy
[1:22:58] everybody here they're brokenhearted to
[1:23:01] preach deliverance to those that are
[1:23:03] free
[1:23:07] those that are captive are recovering of
[1:23:10] sight to those that see
[1:23:14] no to the blind or to set a liberty them
[1:23:19] that are bruised
[1:23:21] and to preach the water
[1:23:24] acceptable years of water in other words
[1:23:27] for god to be powerful somebody must be
[1:23:31] in trouble
[1:23:33] [Applause]
[1:23:36] everybody here ever here that's why the
[1:23:40] pharisee missed jesus christ
[1:23:42] because they thought they were right
[1:23:46] [Music]
[1:23:47] [Applause]
[1:23:49] they thought because they're born in the
[1:23:51] message they grew up in the message they
[1:23:54] have a right to go to heaven
[1:23:56] [Applause]
[1:23:58] brother branham said god does not have
[1:24:00] grandchildren
[1:24:02] god have sons and daughters
[1:24:05] in other words you must meet god
[1:24:07] yourself
[1:24:10] [Applause]
[1:24:12] are you there
[1:24:13] paul on they called himself that he was
[1:24:17] under ignorance
[1:24:19] but paul learned under the feet of the
[1:24:22] of gamalien
[1:24:24] he knew the scroll completely he knew
[1:24:27] they caught left and right but when he
[1:24:29] meets jesus christ
[1:24:31] something changing power
[1:24:33] [Music]
[1:24:36] hallelujah blessed be the name of the
[1:24:38] lord for our desire mercy and not
[1:24:42] sacrifice
[1:24:44] and the knowledge of god oh we don't
[1:24:48] need knowledge
[1:24:51] and the knowledge of god more than water
[1:24:55] this knowledge is light
[1:25:01] take second correction
[1:25:04] the speed is slow
[1:25:06] but i will try my best
[1:25:08] don't push me
[1:25:11] hallelujah i can feel it
[1:25:16] anybody here

[1:25:21] somebody when they tire they want
[1:25:22] everybody to get tired
[1:25:26] [Music]
[1:25:27] they don't want to leave another people
[1:25:29] staying it brings condemnation
[1:25:32] they want you to stop so everybody come
[1:25:34] out
[1:25:39] let's go to second corinthians chapter
[1:25:41] four
[1:25:42] [Laughter]
[1:25:44] have you seen you say you can go and
[1:25:46] then you see they're watching i don't
[1:25:48] want to be the first one
[1:25:50] but in the art they want to go
[1:25:55] amen
[1:25:58] second corinthians chapter four verse
[1:26:00] six you there
[1:26:01] for god
[1:26:03] who commanded the water
[1:26:05] they lied to shine out of what
[1:26:08] remember in the beginning let there be
[1:26:10] light everybody here
[1:26:12] has shine
[1:26:13] in our water if you notice that light is
[1:26:17] not shining in the head
[1:26:20] amen anybody here it's a light that is
[1:26:22] shining in the heart
[1:26:24] have shine in our heart
[1:26:27] to give the water
[1:26:29] the light of the water
[1:26:32] the knowledge of the glory of god in the
[1:26:35] face of who
[1:26:37] so that knowledge is a light that comes
[1:26:40] to you
[1:26:42] recognizing your day recognizing your
[1:26:45] light
[1:26:49] hallelujah
[1:26:50] he said i desire mercy and not sacrifice
[1:26:55] because they have been doing sacrifice
[1:26:57] but the worshiper is not purging
[1:27:00] amen they were having doing all the
[1:27:03] commandments but the which young ruler
[1:27:05] still doesn't have eternal life he said
[1:27:07] i desire mercy and not sacrifice i
[1:27:11] desire the knowledge of god that
[1:27:13] knowledge that comes in your heart
[1:27:16] that's why brother branham say your
[1:27:19] priest
[1:27:20] your leader and so forth can teach you
[1:27:23] your religion
[1:27:27] ever here
[1:27:28] you can learn the message that we are
[1:27:31] trying to do what
[1:27:34] anybody here but that still won't give
[1:27:37] you water
[1:27:41] but here
[1:27:42] if that light is struck in your head you
[1:27:45] won't get eternal life
[1:27:47] here
[1:27:48] he said but you got to accept that
[1:27:51] person
[1:27:52] jesus christ you understand that all of
[1:27:56] you got to accept the person jesus
[1:27:59] christ to have water
[1:28:01] but sometimes other leadership gets so
[1:28:04] much influence on us
[1:28:07] till we don't know what to do when that
[1:28:09] times
[1:28:11] we get sucked up into big preachers in
[1:28:14] the message we got sucked up in to bring
[1:28:17] pastors in the message until we don't
[1:28:19] even know what the holy ghost means
[1:28:24] here
[1:28:25] personalities in the message so and so
[1:28:28] he's preaching everybody go there so so
[1:28:31] he's preaching everybody go there so and
[1:28:33] so he's preaching everybody go there
[1:28:35] never receive nothing
[1:28:37] that you got there sinner you cannot see
[1:28:40] him
[1:28:42] because the personality have taken
[1:28:45] influence over you instead of jesus
[1:28:48] christ
[1:28:49] everybody here so far ever here so far
[1:28:52] and paul is talking about the jewish he
[1:28:54] said i bear them record that they have a
[1:28:58] zeal of god
[1:28:59] when you look at the jews they are
[1:29:01] zealous for god
[1:29:02] [Music]
[1:29:04] they are zealous for god so they should
[1:29:06] have god
[1:29:07] ever here but not according to water
[1:29:11] no revelation
[1:29:15] the jews scenario is the scenario of
[1:29:19] people burning a message
[1:29:21] [Music]
[1:29:24] learn to play in the church they learn
[1:29:27] to be musician but there is no
[1:29:29] revelation to what they were doing the
[1:29:32] jewish could bring the lamb into the
[1:29:35] temple but they don't even understand
[1:29:37] why they're bringing the lamb to the
[1:29:39] temple
[1:29:40] they were not just bringing the lamb to
[1:29:42] the temple as a routine
[1:29:45] but that lamb was speaking about
[1:29:47] something
[1:29:49] [Applause]
[1:29:51] the ignorance of the jews
[1:29:54] but here
[1:29:56] for them being ignorant of god's
[1:29:59] righteousness
[1:30:00] and going about to establish the water
[1:30:04] this is when you begin to try to leave
[1:30:06] the message by yourself
[1:30:09] you begin to establish your own message
[1:30:12] by yourself
[1:30:15] everybody here have not submitted
[1:30:18] themselves unto the righteousness of
[1:30:20] water there is nothing you can fabricate
[1:30:24] but you must meet god yourself
[1:30:28] even if you never smoke
[1:30:31] even if you never slept with a man even
[1:30:34] if you never thought the lie
[1:30:36] but you were born in sin
[1:30:39] sharpening iniquity coming into the
[1:30:42] world speaking life you must be born
[1:30:45] again
[1:30:46] [Applause]
[1:30:48] everybody here all your righteousness is
[1:30:51] a filthy rag
[1:30:53] everybody here
[1:30:55] i was born in the message i have nothing
[1:30:57] to do you must repent
[1:31:00] ever here
[1:31:02] the bible says
[1:31:04] that in jerusalem the people that were
[1:31:06] there were devout men
[1:31:08] how can peter tell devout men to repent
[1:31:13] they were good people they came to
[1:31:15] worship and peter said except you repent
[1:31:18] they said what can we do he say repent
[1:31:20] repent of what
[1:31:22] [Music]
[1:31:23] repent of what
[1:31:25] you never smoke
[1:31:27] you repent of what
[1:31:29] repent of what
[1:31:30] you are never in a nightclub you're
[1:31:32] going to repent of what
[1:31:33] ever here you must recognize yourself as
[1:31:37] a sinner
[1:31:38] [Applause]
[1:31:40] because what you living is a religion
[1:31:44] it is not an experience
[1:31:47] an experience is a life
[1:31:49] [Applause]
[1:31:53] oh my god
[1:31:55] blessed be the name of the lord
[1:31:57] in acts chapter 14
[1:32:00] the bible says when paul performed a
[1:32:03] miracle
[1:32:04] the bible say
[1:32:06] which when the apostle barnabas and paul
[1:32:09] heard of them they rent their clothes
[1:32:11] because they came to worship them right
[1:32:13] back here and run in among the people
[1:32:15] crying out and saying sir why do you do
[1:32:18] these things
[1:32:19] we also are men of like passion with you
[1:32:23] and preach unto you that you should turn
[1:32:26] from these vanities unto the living god
[1:32:29] which made heaven and earth and the sea
[1:32:32] and all things that are doing who in
[1:32:35] time passed
[1:32:37] suffered water all nation to walk in
[1:32:42] their own water
[1:32:46] anybody here
[1:32:48] the gentile
[1:32:50] right back here
[1:32:51] are like people who were born outside
[1:32:55] the message
[1:32:56] [Music]
[1:32:58] everybody
[1:32:59] they didn't know better
[1:33:02] they grew up in the ghetto everybody's
[1:33:04] cussing
[1:33:05] everybody's drinking everybody's smoking
[1:33:09] everybody is doing bad thing ever here
[1:33:12] so the ignorance is an ignorance of
[1:33:15] unbelief in sin
[1:33:18] amen
[1:33:19] take acts 17.
[1:33:24] and back here
[1:33:27] here and the dangerous is the one born
[1:33:30] in the message
[1:33:31] because you feel like he doesn't need
[1:33:33] god
[1:33:36] here
[1:33:37] everybody here the one outside knows
[1:33:40] already the bad part
[1:33:42] and when a change happened he can
[1:33:45] quickly tell that i am changing
[1:33:47] because i was bad now i can see myself
[1:33:50] change
[1:33:51] but the other one was under religion
[1:33:56] it's like what else do i need
[1:34:00] everybody
[1:34:02] acts 17 16. if you're there you can say
[1:34:05] amen
[1:34:06] verse 16 now while paul waited for them
[1:34:10] at athens
[1:34:11] his spirit was stirring him when he saw
[1:34:14] the city
[1:34:16] holy
[1:34:17] holy now the word completely
[1:34:19] giving to water
[1:34:22] so paul get into us and everywhere adam
[1:34:26] you don't see that in israel except if
[1:34:29] he's or you're backsliding
[1:34:31] here
[1:34:32] in your home everything good
[1:34:34] mama put the picture of christ
[1:34:37] daddy put the cloud everything is good
[1:34:40] they were monitoring everything but in
[1:34:42] another somebody else home when you get
[1:34:44] there it's a naked woman on the wall
[1:34:48] when you get there
[1:34:50] there is beer over there there is a
[1:34:52] honeycomb sitting over there there is a
[1:34:54] bad wiser over there everything is a
[1:34:57] dollar tree and a big tv screen like
[1:34:59] this
[1:35:00] watching soccer on sunday or football
[1:35:03] [Music]
[1:35:04] that's the genta
[1:35:09] let's go to 24.
[1:35:13] everybody here
[1:35:14] god that made the world
[1:35:17] and all things therein
[1:35:19] saying that he is lord of heaven and
[1:35:22] earth dwell not in temple made with
[1:35:25] hands
[1:35:26] here
[1:35:27] neither is worship with man's hand as
[1:35:30] though he needed anything seeing he give
[1:35:32] to all life and breath and all things
[1:35:35] he's a good god
[1:35:37] verse 26 and has made of how many blood
[1:35:43] one blood
[1:35:44] all nations of men
[1:35:47] for to dwell on all the face of the
[1:35:49] earth and has determined the time before
[1:35:53] appointed and the bond of their
[1:35:55] habitation so god distribute it you go
[1:35:58] over there you go there you go there
[1:36:00] ever here verse 27 that that should seek
[1:36:03] the lord
[1:36:04] if happily in other words perhaps they
[1:36:07] might feel after him and found him
[1:36:10] though he be not far from every one of
[1:36:12] us
[1:36:13] here
[1:36:14] for in him
[1:36:16] we live
[1:36:17] and move and have our being as certain
[1:36:20] also as your own poet have said for we
[1:36:24] are also his offspring we are his
[1:36:27] children
[1:36:28] watch now clearly for as much then as we
[1:36:31] are the offering of god the children of
[1:36:34] god
[1:36:35] we ought not to think that the godhead
[1:36:38] is like to gold
[1:36:40] or silver
[1:36:42] or stone idolatry
[1:36:44] graven by art and immense device
[1:36:48] you ready
[1:36:49] verse 30 and the time of this water
[1:36:54] do you see the ignorance of the gentile
[1:36:56] the time of this ignorant god did water
[1:37:00] in other words god never looked at the
[1:37:03] gentiles because they didn't know any
[1:37:05] better
[1:37:06] ever here but adam said that's the
[1:37:08] reason why when they went to the witch
[1:37:11] doctor they can believe anything and god
[1:37:13] healed them through that
[1:37:18] belief somebody who can understand the
[1:37:22] ignorance
[1:37:25] that's the high priest
[1:37:26] he doesn't know any better because while
[1:37:29] we were yet sinners
[1:37:32] christ did what
[1:37:35] [Music]
[1:37:36] he understood your ignorance
[1:37:38] he said they don't know any better but
[1:37:40] they are my children i will handle them
[1:37:43] at a certain time
[1:37:44] ever here god wink at it but now
[1:37:49] command all men
[1:37:51] everywhere to do water
[1:37:53] ever here at the beginning he blinded
[1:37:56] his eyes he said i don't want to look at
[1:37:57] them they don't know what they're doing
[1:37:59] but now that i am revealing to the world
[1:38:02] everybody must repent
[1:38:06] everybody here so there is an ignorance
[1:38:08] of the jews and there is an ignorance of
[1:38:10] the gender the gender is completely
[1:38:14] turned from one way of living into a
[1:38:16] different way of living he can tell the
[1:38:19] difference quickly the jewish it's on
[1:38:21] the same place but the difference is on
[1:38:23] the revelation
[1:38:25] amen
[1:38:26] everybody
[1:38:28] my god let me rush quickly amen
[1:38:30] paul said that this i said therefore and
[1:38:33] testify in the lord that he has fourth
[1:38:37] walk not as other who
[1:38:40] gentle walk in the vanity of the man
[1:38:44] everybody
[1:38:45] having the understanding how
[1:38:48] being water
[1:38:49] alienated from the life of food
[1:38:52] through water
[1:38:54] that was in water
[1:38:56] because of the brightness of water
[1:38:59] that's why the light of the gospel comes
[1:39:01] to the heart
[1:39:05] i hope you're getting this very well
[1:39:08] blessed be the name of the lord who
[1:39:10] passed feeling have given themselves
[1:39:13] over until a seriousness to work on
[1:39:16] uncleanness with water
[1:39:18] they didn't know that's how they grew up
[1:39:20] grandpa casting
[1:39:22] 14 marriages changing husbands that's
[1:39:24] how i grew they didn't know any better
[1:39:27] ever here and peter said as obedient
[1:39:30] children
[1:39:30] not fashioning yourself according to the
[1:39:33] former lust in your water
[1:39:35] but as he which has called you is holy
[1:39:40] so be water
[1:39:42] in all manner of water
[1:39:44] because it's written be holy for i am
[1:39:46] water there is an ignorance of the
[1:39:49] jewish people and there is an ignorance
[1:39:52] of the gentiles but the high priest must
[1:39:55] understand the ignorance amen
[1:39:58] amen hallelujah
[1:40:00] let's go to hebrew chapter 2.
[1:40:08] so when you bring it to the high priest
[1:40:10] he's looking at you differently
[1:40:13] he's looking he said he's a gentile
[1:40:15] he didn't know any better
[1:40:17] what do you expect from him that's how
[1:40:19] he grew
[1:40:20] understand them but what is the desire
[1:40:23] of his heart
[1:40:25] does he want to serve god that's all i'm
[1:40:27] looking for i am not looking on the
[1:40:29] outside because it's just a matter of
[1:40:32] time and i will change the outside as
[1:40:35] long as i can change the inside
[1:40:38] [Music]
[1:40:39] anybody here
[1:40:41] hebrew 2 if you're there let's go to
[1:40:43] verse 9
[1:40:44] let's see this high priest
[1:40:46] but we see who
[1:40:48] we know our high priest who was made a
[1:40:50] little lower
[1:40:52] than the angel the high priest must be
[1:40:54] human ever here
[1:40:57] for the suffering of death we talked
[1:40:59] about this crown with glory and honor
[1:41:03] that he by the grace of god should test
[1:41:06] death for who
[1:41:08] he's going to test it for everyone
[1:41:11] here
[1:41:12] for he became him
[1:41:14] for whom all things
[1:41:16] are all things and by whom are all
[1:41:19] things in bringing many water
[1:41:22] to water
[1:41:23] to make the captain of their salvation
[1:41:26] perfect through water
[1:41:29] my god
[1:41:30] verse 11 for both he that sanctifies
[1:41:34] remember this god and they who are
[1:41:37] sanctified we
[1:41:39] all are water
[1:41:41] for which cause he is not ashamed to
[1:41:44] call them water
[1:41:46] a bad case so far
[1:41:48] he's our brother
[1:41:49] yet he's a bigger brother because he's
[1:41:51] the high priest the high priest was a
[1:41:53] brother elevated among above the
[1:41:56] brothers remember
[1:41:57] saying i will declare your name
[1:42:00] to my brethren in the midst of the
[1:42:02] church i will sing our praise to you and
[1:42:06] again i will put my trust in him
[1:42:09] and again behold i
[1:42:13] and who
[1:42:15] which who
[1:42:17] has water
[1:42:18] so you the child that god gave to jesus
[1:42:24] everybody here
[1:42:26] me and my children
[1:42:28] me the priest and king
[1:42:31] and my children the sons of the high
[1:42:33] priest
[1:42:34] me and my children ever care for as much
[1:42:38] then as the children are partaking of
[1:42:41] water
[1:42:43] flesh and blood
[1:42:44] because
[1:42:46] we became human
[1:42:48] he must become human like me
[1:42:51] if we never became human no problem
[1:42:55] but because we became human
[1:42:58] the high priest cannot stay there be god
[1:43:02] and we human
[1:43:03] he cannot understand us
[1:43:06] everybody here
[1:43:07] ever here we are talking like human he's
[1:43:11] talking like god there is a conflict on
[1:43:14] our conversation
[1:43:17] so we must take god
[1:43:20] and put him inhuman
[1:43:22] then when we talk we understand one
[1:43:25] another
[1:43:26] everybody here so when he is pleading
[1:43:29] for us he is understanding us as human
[1:43:32] beings
[1:43:33] [Music]
[1:43:35] everybody here for as much then as the
[1:43:38] children are partaker of the flesh and
[1:43:41] blood he our high priest also himself
[1:43:45] likewise took the part of the same
[1:43:48] that through the true death he might
[1:43:51] destroy him that had the power of death
[1:43:54] that is the
[1:43:56] and delivered them who true fear
[1:43:59] of death
[1:44:00] where all their lifetimes subject to
[1:44:03] water
[1:44:04] [Music]
[1:44:06] for verily he took note on him the
[1:44:09] nature of water
[1:44:11] if jesus would have come like an angel
[1:44:14] it's a problem
[1:44:15] [Music]
[1:44:16] when we sing amazing grace angels don't
[1:44:19] know what we're talking about
[1:44:21] because they were never
[1:44:23] have i mean lost and then get saved
[1:44:25] again angel wants you lost you lost
[1:44:27] forever
[1:44:30] hallelujah
[1:44:31] very he took note on him the nature of
[1:44:34] angel but took on him
[1:44:38] the nature of who
[1:44:39] the seed of abraham not natural now
[1:44:43] remember the spiritual seed ever here
[1:44:46] wherefore in all things
[1:44:49] he behoove him to be made like his water
[1:44:54] so there is nothing that you are
[1:44:58] that jesus was not amen
[1:45:02] god made sure that jesus is exactly like
[1:45:07] you in every aspect
[1:45:11] if you hunger jesus must hunger
[1:45:14] if you get upset jesus must be able to
[1:45:17] get upset
[1:45:18] [Applause]
[1:45:23] do you follow me
[1:45:24] you follow me if you walk you get tired
[1:45:27] jesus must walk and get tired
[1:45:30] if they give jesus a certain power he
[1:45:33] doesn't get tired god is unjust
[1:45:41] in every point
[1:45:43] everything
[1:45:44] he's just like you so when you are
[1:45:47] praying to jesus
[1:45:49] don't be praying to somebody like a big
[1:45:52] god
[1:45:53] somewhere like that
[1:45:55] talk to him like a human being
[1:46:01] do you follow me
[1:46:02] don't try to sophisticate your prayer
[1:46:07] don't try to make your prayers special
[1:46:10] oh hallelujah oh you the king of kings
[1:46:13] you're wasting your time
[1:46:16] here be normal
[1:46:19] sit down and say father i am upset
[1:46:24] you know what upset me
[1:46:27] and at this point if you don't help me
[1:46:30] i'll be in trouble
[1:46:32] talk to him like a man
[1:46:35] there is one mediator between god and
[1:46:39] man it's the man not the god the man
[1:46:44] jesus christ
[1:46:48] [Applause]
[1:46:52] everybody if you call your father do you
[1:46:56] think your father will say no
[1:46:58] he will come and say what's going on
[1:47:00] what do you think if you call him
[1:47:03] we have a tendency to feel like you got
[1:47:05] a bag and bag and bed and bed before god
[1:47:08] comes up he doesn't act like that
[1:47:11] you need to change your way of talking
[1:47:13] to him
[1:47:16] even when you don't feel like he's near
[1:47:19] he's already right there it's you to
[1:47:23] understand
[1:47:24] [Applause]
[1:47:28] my god
[1:47:30] let's go to verse 17. lord help me
[1:47:33] amen wherefore in all things
[1:47:36] he behoove him to be made life to his
[1:47:39] brethren
[1:47:40] that he might be what
[1:47:43] i desire what my friend
[1:47:46] god did detract that
[1:47:49] so jesus can be quick to be merciful
[1:47:53] [Music]
[1:47:57] so that he might be merciful
[1:48:00] ever here
[1:48:01] and a faithful water
[1:48:05] is somebody waiting
[1:48:07] and they fail for water
[1:48:09] high priest in faith returning to water
[1:48:12] to god to make reconciliation
[1:48:15] for the sin of the water for in death
[1:48:20] he himself has water
[1:48:22] being watered
[1:48:24] he is able
[1:48:26] to do what
[1:48:28] to say another one to help
[1:48:31] damn that i want her
[1:48:33] god let jesus be tempted just like you
[1:48:38] so when you are tempted
[1:48:41] jesus will remember ah
[1:48:43] i remember how bad he was let me quickly
[1:48:45] go help him
[1:48:46] [Applause]
[1:48:49] [Music]
[1:48:50] ever here he was tempted in no point
[1:48:55] he understand when you are tempted by a
[1:48:57] woman
[1:48:58] he understands when you are tempted by a
[1:49:00] man he understands when you are tempted
[1:49:03] by lust he knows it
[1:49:06] he was tempted of that
[1:49:14] when you talk to god you are talking to
[1:49:16] him like a man who doesn't understand
[1:49:18] sin
[1:49:20] that was in the old testament
[1:49:23] ever here
[1:49:25] listen to this brother branham say in uh
[1:49:28] john the first john first the bible says
[1:49:30] for all
[1:49:31] that is in the world the water
[1:49:35] and the lust of the eyes and the proud
[1:49:37] of life is not of the father but is of
[1:49:39] the water
[1:49:41] in other words everything that is in
[1:49:42] this world is summarizes in three
[1:49:45] categories
[1:49:46] the last of the flesh
[1:49:48] the last of the eyes and the pride of
[1:49:50] life everything that you do in life
[1:49:53] every attack that you have is only in
[1:49:57] these three categories if it's not under
[1:49:59] pride
[1:50:00] that's why you put your
[1:50:02] your
[1:50:03] your picture on facebook all the time
[1:50:06] it's either by something like that all
[1:50:08] of them it's only under those three
[1:50:10] categories ever here
[1:50:12] so jesus could go one by one and say
[1:50:15] this and use it disuse it no jesus went
[1:50:17] and summarized the three
[1:50:20] and say satan come and tempt me in those
[1:50:22] three aspects
[1:50:24] so i can cover everything
[1:50:30] by the bottom say a quick look at those
[1:50:32] scriptures which involve the lord jesus
[1:50:36] overcoming will bring out the truth of
[1:50:39] this proposition
[1:50:41] in matthew 4 when jesus is tempted of
[1:50:44] the devil he overcame the water
[1:50:48] the personal temptation of satan bridal
[1:50:52] and by the water
[1:50:54] in each of the three major trials
[1:50:58] that corresponded
[1:51:00] exactly to the temptation of the garden
[1:51:04] of eden
[1:51:05] the last of the flesh the lust of the
[1:51:08] eye and the pride of life jesus overcame
[1:51:11] by water so everything that the devil
[1:51:15] can bring unto you
[1:51:17] even if you are not strong
[1:51:19] if you can stand on the word of god
[1:51:22] you can defeat everything
[1:51:26] without a vision
[1:51:30] [Applause]
[1:51:32] hallelujah hallelujah the bible says
[1:51:35] seeing them
[1:51:36] that we have a high priest that is
[1:51:39] passed into heaven
[1:51:41] jesus the son of god let us death let us
[1:51:44] hold fast our profession in other words
[1:51:47] don't let loose
[1:51:49] because he's understanding you for we
[1:51:51] have not a high priest
[1:51:53] which cannot be touched
[1:51:55] with the water
[1:51:57] of our water
[1:51:58] paul is telling you the man that is
[1:52:00] there that you pray to
[1:52:02] understand you very well
[1:52:05] it is not a man that doesn't understand
[1:52:08] if matter of fact when they when they
[1:52:10] touch you they are really touching him
[1:52:12] everything somebody is doing to you he's
[1:52:15] understanding that in his body in heaven
[1:52:19] amen
[1:52:21] hallelujah he said he cannot be touched
[1:52:24] with the feelings of the feeling of her
[1:52:26] infirmities but was in water
[1:52:32] how many points
[1:52:34] all points what
[1:52:36] like water
[1:52:38] yet without water
[1:52:41] why did they tempt him
[1:52:43] so he can understand when you're tempted
[1:52:45] amen
[1:52:46] let us therefore come home
[1:52:49] that's why you don't pray afraid
[1:52:54] everybody care because the man that
[1:52:56] you're praying to knows what is going on
[1:52:59] matter of fact the god even took sin and
[1:53:01] put on his body so he can feel sin
[1:53:05] amen
[1:53:07] hallelujah let us therefore come broadly
[1:53:11] unto the throne of grace that we may
[1:53:13] obtain water
[1:53:15] i desire water
[1:53:17] and found grace to help in the time of
[1:53:21] water so when you are in need what do
[1:53:23] you have to do
[1:53:26] take it to the lord in prayer
[1:53:29] but when you're praying you're praying
[1:53:31] sincerely
[1:53:33] and talking to him plainly
[1:53:36] don't even go left and right that you
[1:53:38] understand what i'm saying no
[1:53:40] tell him this is what i have done
[1:53:44] father i did it i'm struggling
[1:53:47] but i don't want to do it but there is
[1:53:49] something that is taking over me and i
[1:53:52] found myself doing it but in my heart i
[1:53:55] don't want to do it would you please
[1:53:57] help me
[1:53:59] [Music]
[1:53:59] [Applause]
[1:54:05] but here then the christian life is not
[1:54:08] hard anymore
[1:54:09] it is hard because you're trying to help
[1:54:12] yourself
[1:54:13] you cannot help yourself you are failure
[1:54:16] to begin with you need to depend on god
[1:54:20] god who is reaching mercy
[1:54:23] to come and help you
[1:54:24] because he went through the cross
[1:54:27] because of you
[1:54:29] why do you want a double worker
[1:54:32] you're carrying a luggage
[1:54:34] and somebody stopped with a car and they
[1:54:36] pick you up and you take the carriage
[1:54:38] and then you hold it sitting in the car
[1:54:40] [Music]
[1:54:42] open the trunk put it in the trunk sit
[1:54:45] in the car and relax
[1:54:55] this high priest must be touched with
[1:54:58] the water
[1:54:59] a high priest it's very important for
[1:55:02] the high priest to have the feeling
[1:55:05] [Music]
[1:55:09] back here
[1:55:10] brother bottom said there was a man a
[1:55:12] preacher who argued with his wife
[1:55:14] about here and when they finish arguing
[1:55:18] he was going out
[1:55:20] and he turned he said love you
[1:55:22] and his wife said love you
[1:55:24] and they went
[1:55:25] and he and his wife begin to cry
[1:55:28] about here and what random say the
[1:55:30] preacher begin to go and say what about
[1:55:32] if something happened
[1:55:34] what about if i get in the car wreck
[1:55:36] what about if something happened to me
[1:55:38] and i'm dead right now

[1:55:45] let me go back again he went right away
[1:55:48] he said love you she said love you
[1:55:50] brother adam said this time

[1:56:00] to your brother you can say i love you
[1:56:02] to your children you can say i love you
[1:56:05] to your wife but you must understand the
[1:56:08] feeling behind i love you
[1:56:12] if i love you that's a hell feeling it's
[1:56:15] hypo hypocrisy
[1:56:17] that's why it's not working
[1:56:21] hallelujah
[1:56:23] if somebody say thank you
[1:56:25] or you talk to somebody did you receive
[1:56:27] what i gave you yes thank you
[1:56:29] uh and and you were saying what
[1:56:31] there is no feeling
[1:56:33] maybe next time that person will never
[1:56:35] give you something
[1:56:36] because you never appreciate it you
[1:56:39] never stop and say brother thank you
[1:56:41] very much for giving me this
[1:56:44] you took it for granted
[1:56:46] [Applause]
[1:56:48] everybody here
[1:56:49] don't wait for somebody to remind you
[1:56:52] if they gave you something
[1:56:54] whether it's an apple whether it's a
[1:56:56] coca-cola

[1:57:08] did you receive what i said oh i'm sorry
[1:57:11] i was so busy thank you very much it's
[1:57:13] too late
[1:57:16] the high priest
[1:57:17] must have feelings
[1:57:20] what is the power of feeling brother
[1:57:21] branham he said these wikis
[1:57:24] enriquetas
[1:57:26] have that that have so such the words
[1:57:30] i have called them wiki
[1:57:32] and wikita
[1:57:34] god gave me to understand i should not
[1:57:37] do that
[1:57:41] anybody here
[1:57:43] because that is many of them are still
[1:57:47] his water
[1:57:48] a high priest must understand they're
[1:57:52] ignorant
[1:57:52] [Music]
[1:57:54] when you say ricky among those wicked
[1:57:56] they are children of god they just don't
[1:57:58] know yet and you are calling them ricky
[1:58:01] and their father say be careful because
[1:58:04] you call in general but under there i
[1:58:05] have not called some of them you need to
[1:58:07] be careful but here he said they can't
[1:58:10] help
[1:58:12] because they act so much different some
[1:58:15] of these old called formal churches has
[1:58:18] got them that spirit upon them they just
[1:58:20] pick up things from religion
[1:58:22] from panic also from presbyterian but
[1:58:24] here they are in a prison as israel was
[1:58:28] in prison
[1:58:30] just as much as moses went down to
[1:58:32] deliver them from slavery human being
[1:58:35] that love jesus christ would serve him
[1:58:38] if
[1:58:40] they only know
[1:58:42] what to serve him by
[1:58:44] and they are in bondage and the
[1:58:47] denominationalism
[1:58:49] that tell them don't do this and don't
[1:58:51] do that religion
[1:58:54] but here
[1:58:55] they don't know any better and brother
[1:58:57] bottom say moses lost the feeling of his
[1:59:00] people because they would not listen to
[1:59:03] him
[1:59:05] amen
[1:59:06] how are you going to pray for them moses
[1:59:09] everybody here
[1:59:10] brother roy you see your dream and now i
[1:59:13] cannot go with a ministry like that
[1:59:17] until i feel different in my heart about
[1:59:20] it
[1:59:21] no matter if god till tell me
[1:59:27] can i read it again
[1:59:28] brother what adam say if god tell me to
[1:59:31] go i won't go
[1:59:32] [Music]
[1:59:35] because i don't have any more feeling
[1:59:39] i cannot operate like a high priest
[1:59:41] anymore
[1:59:42] you cannot touch my children
[1:59:46] he said something got to changing me
[1:59:50] because i in my heart if i go out there
[1:59:53] feeling the way i do now i still feel
[1:59:56] that they ought to have heard that
[1:59:58] message
[1:59:59] i preached to them high heel they still
[2:00:01] do it
[2:00:02] i preached to them stop makeup they
[2:00:04] still put it i preach to them stop
[2:00:07] painting your nails they're still doing
[2:00:08] it
[2:00:09] they don't want to listen
[2:00:11] i can pray for them
[2:00:15] because you're not the one changing them
[2:00:17] if god doesn't want to change them if
[2:00:20] you change that way then you can pray
[2:00:21] for them
[2:00:24] if you think they must hear me
[2:00:27] don't preach them
[2:00:31] hallelujah
[2:00:32] if i still feel that they ought to have
[2:00:35] heard the message
[2:00:36] they ought to have done it and i don't
[2:00:39] have the feeling for the people that i
[2:00:41] should have until i can get that feeling
[2:00:44] there is no need in me going because
[2:00:47] i'll be here
[2:00:49] all these years i try to serve him with
[2:00:51] a true heart and i won't go out there
[2:00:54] being a hypocrite i got to feel that
[2:00:58] that it is not ricky
[2:01:00] enriqueta it is not this bunch it is
[2:01:03] god's children that is in water
[2:01:06] if you say ricky you didn't understand
[2:01:09] but if you say it's a child of god that
[2:01:12] is just deceived by the devil
[2:01:14] then your approach is different then go
[2:01:16] ahead you can do it but here
[2:01:19] that i must go until i can feel that way
[2:01:22] i just have to loaf around preach some
[2:01:25] convention and think but do what
[2:01:27] the feeling is important a high priest
[2:01:30] that can be touched by the feeling of
[2:01:32] our water
[2:01:33] everybody here so far the bible says
[2:01:36] that when he was coming to the sheep he
[2:01:39] that has been possessed with devil
[2:01:41] prayed him that he might be with him
[2:01:43] that's legion how bit jesus suffer him
[2:01:46] not but say unto him go home to that
[2:01:49] friend and tell them how great things
[2:01:51] the lord have done for thee and had
[2:01:54] compassion on them
[2:01:56] brethren if any man be overtaken in your
[2:01:58] fault
[2:01:59] ye which are spiritual
[2:02:04] [Music]
[2:02:06] you must be spiritual you must be a good
[2:02:10] high priest
[2:02:11] if you're not a good high priest don't
[2:02:13] go
[2:02:14] everybody here
[2:02:16] sister we so disappointed of you we
[2:02:18] never thought you can do something like
[2:02:20] this
[2:02:21] don't go
[2:02:23] don't go
[2:02:24] don't go talk to him
[2:02:27] brother branham said even if you go see
[2:02:30] somebody who's sick don't tell him that
[2:02:32] oh you lost so much weight like this
[2:02:34] don't go to the hospital stay in your
[2:02:36] home
[2:02:40] because there is no feeling
[2:02:44] hallelujah lead with your spiritual
[2:02:48] restore such a one in the spirit of
[2:02:51] water
[2:02:52] considering water
[2:02:54] lest there also be water
[2:02:57] a high priest have also infirmities
[2:03:01] that's why when he's trying to help he's
[2:03:03] remembering what he also did himself
[2:03:08] ever here and then bear you want another
[2:03:12] water and so fulfilling their love who
[2:03:16] a high priest
[2:03:17] must have compassion
[2:03:20] okay compassion to the ignorant in the
[2:03:23] message and outside the message
[2:03:25] and then he must understand the people
[2:03:27] that are out of the way
[2:03:29] if not don't go
[2:03:31] don't go show them how much you know
[2:03:33] [Music]
[2:03:35] don't go show them how much you go
[2:03:38] i'm gonna prove to them that they don't
[2:03:40] know nothing
[2:03:42] your feeling is wrong
[2:03:44] you're gonna get in the debate
[2:03:46] you win the debate but they don't change
[2:03:50] many debating the message over the
[2:03:53] internet
[2:03:54] young people in the message debating
[2:03:56] debating
[2:03:58] no solution
[2:03:59] because there is no feeling it's a show
[2:04:02] off but when you approach like a high
[2:04:04] priest
[2:04:05] after your debate after your
[2:04:08] conversation
[2:04:10] somebody will go home and say i need to
[2:04:12] get closer to that sister
[2:04:14] when she was talking to me it was not
[2:04:16] really the word it is the high priest
[2:04:19] that is filling that person
[2:04:24] everybody here so far everybody here so
[2:04:26] far now buckle up
[2:04:30] are you ready praise god you ready
[2:04:33] i spoke to you that jesus comes in three
[2:04:35] names
[2:04:37] son of man
[2:04:40] means water
[2:04:41] prophet son of god means what
[2:04:46] ever
[2:04:47] priest and son of death it means what
[2:04:51] ever here so far
[2:04:53] hallelujah
[2:04:55] brother branham say he came first as the
[2:04:58] prophet
[2:04:59] and they crucified him his own crucified
[2:05:02] him he came as the son of man then after
[2:05:06] the holy spirit came he was there
[2:05:10] so when jesus departed
[2:05:12] and the church ages started
[2:05:14] it was the same jesus that came back on
[2:05:17] the day of pentecost but when he's
[2:05:19] coming on the day of pentecost he's not
[2:05:22] coming as the son of man
[2:05:25] but here
[2:05:26] he's feeling the disciple as a priest
[2:05:28] [Music]
[2:05:33] hallelujah
[2:05:34] he was the holy spirit
[2:05:37] son of god he lived through the set the
[2:05:40] church ages as waters
[2:05:43] in other words throughout the seven
[2:05:45] churches he is a priest
[2:05:50] ever here
[2:05:51] so throughout the church ages he is
[2:05:54] rescuing his children
[2:05:57] he is a priest
[2:06:00] [Music]
[2:06:01] [Applause]
[2:06:01] [Music]
[2:06:03] my god hallelujah in the millennium he
[2:06:07] will be son of david sitting upon the
[2:06:09] throne of his father david he is the son
[2:06:12] of david
[2:06:14] after his death
[2:06:16] burial and resurrection he came on the
[2:06:20] day of water
[2:06:21] as water
[2:06:23] as a priest
[2:06:27] why because somebody's in trouble
[2:06:30] somebody is out of the way
[2:06:32] i'm going to the gentile
[2:06:34] the gentiles are ignorant
[2:06:37] they don't know nothing about me
[2:06:39] i cannot come as a son of man
[2:06:42] because son of man is prophet
[2:06:45] jewish people were trained under prophet
[2:06:48] samaritan were trained on the prophet
[2:06:51] but the gentiles does don't know what a
[2:06:53] prophet is i must come as a priest to
[2:06:57] understand their ignorance
[2:07:00] [Applause]
[2:07:04] are we okay
[2:07:06] did i lose somebody
[2:07:08] did i lose someone we okay she said
[2:07:10] praise be the name of the lord he said
[2:07:13] god the spirit in the form of the
[2:07:17] what was he doing he was changing
[2:07:20] himself making himself known to his
[2:07:23] people in a different form the holy
[2:07:26] spirit which is god he came to deal
[2:07:29] through the water
[2:07:31] as a son of god the water
[2:07:34] why is he coming as a son of god to the
[2:07:37] seven church churches i'm leaving israel
[2:07:39] i'm going to get a bread out of the
[2:07:42] gentile for my name's sake because i
[2:07:45] came to the jews and the jews received
[2:07:48] me not the jews rejected me and they
[2:07:51] crucified me but all those that are
[2:07:54] there they don't know moses they don't
[2:07:56] know isaiah they don't know the prophet
[2:07:59] they don't know the law if i approach
[2:08:01] them as son of man they would not
[2:08:04] understand me if i told them moses said
[2:08:07] they don't know who moses is if i say
[2:08:09] david say they don't know who david said
[2:08:12] i must be a priest so when i'm preaching
[2:08:16] to them i'm i'm i'm preaching to them
[2:08:19] knowing that they don't know what the
[2:08:21] jews know
[2:08:24] [Music]
[2:08:28] everybody cares so far
[2:08:30] because to the jews he could tell them
[2:08:33] search the scripture
[2:08:35] in them you think you have eternal life
[2:08:37] they are testify of me
[2:08:39] if you come to the gentile you say
[2:08:41] search the scripture with scripture the
[2:08:44] gentiles didn't have god
[2:08:45] we didn't have god we have endearmed
[2:08:49] from the commonwealth of israel which
[2:08:52] scripture do i know
[2:08:53] so i must flip myself as a son of god as
[2:08:57] a priest because i'm dealing with
[2:08:59] ignorant people and the people that are
[2:09:02] out of the way that's how i can feel
[2:09:05] their infirmities

[2:16:50] yet three of them three on one
[2:16:53] that was 300 years later at the water
[2:17:00] is saying here
[2:17:02] that the church
[2:17:04] started in jerusalem yes
[2:17:06] here
[2:17:07] and brother branham said when they start
[2:17:10] in jerusalem
[2:17:11] right here in jerusalem ever here as the
[2:17:15] church began to progress
[2:17:17] something happened somebody attacked the
[2:17:19] church
[2:17:20] and when they attacked the church
[2:17:22] the first thing they were trying to do
[2:17:24] to the church was to remove the clothing
[2:17:28] off from the church everybody here
[2:17:31] back here and that attack brother
[2:17:34] branham said he went all the way to the
[2:17:37] nazi council
[2:17:41] hallelujah
[2:17:42] lord help your children amen
[2:17:45] when he start out a spirit of nicolet
[2:17:48] and to form an organization among the
[2:17:51] people and then he kept on
[2:17:54] going on going on become a saying then
[2:17:57] it became a doctrine you remember christ
[2:18:00] speaking back to the church the hatest
[2:18:03] it's in the book of revelation
[2:18:05] the deed of this nicholaten which i hate
[2:18:07] you
[2:18:08] trying to conquer
[2:18:11] take the water
[2:18:13] just only one man he could forgive all
[2:18:17] the sin and everything brother obama
[2:18:20] said the spirit when he start working he
[2:18:23] start working as a white horse
[2:18:26] here
[2:18:27] he starts from the time of paul
[2:18:30] all the way to the nazi castle
[2:18:33] where is the nazi council i want you to
[2:18:36] stay tight now amen
[2:18:38] but what i'm saying then at the first
[2:18:41] great night scene council when i read
[2:18:44] that i just fell on my knees
[2:18:47] the great nazi council has taken place
[2:18:49] in water
[2:18:52] in 325
[2:18:55] this is a different deal my friend
[2:18:57] all of them was brought together the
[2:19:00] bishop the father of the christian faith
[2:19:03] was brought together in nursing that is
[2:19:05] the reason he was called the nursing
[2:19:07] cancer in eddie 325
[2:19:11] if the spirit of nicolaitan which
[2:19:15] expressed itself as a white horse
[2:19:18] attacked the church
[2:19:20] from its birth all the way to 325
[2:19:25] let us stress that in the church ages as
[2:19:28] jesus is the high priest
[2:19:30] are we there
[2:19:31] when we look at the age of emphasis and
[2:19:34] we blow it up
[2:19:36] fs is starting 53
[2:19:39] and ended in 170.
[2:19:42] you who are on the computer make sure
[2:19:44] this is big on the computer so somebody
[2:19:46] can study it at home everybody here
[2:19:49] brother bonham said he went all the way
[2:19:51] to 325
[2:19:53] if we bring 325
[2:19:56] we found that 325 truly is greater than
[2:19:59] 53.
[2:20:01] but 325 is also greater than 170.
[2:20:05] so there is no way we can put 325 right
[2:20:08] there
[2:20:09] he doesn't match
[2:20:12] any question
[2:20:13] [Music]
[2:20:14] any question did i lose anybody
[2:20:18] it's not right
[2:20:19] when we brought up the second church of
[2:20:21] jesus
[2:20:22] the second church age is starting 170
[2:20:26] until 3 20 at 3 12
[2:20:29] when we put 325 there
[2:20:32] 325 is true it's greater than 170
[2:20:37] but 325 is also greater than 312.
[2:20:41] you on the computer leave it right there
[2:20:43] ever here not to screen one screen so
[2:20:46] you can study home but here
[2:20:49] there's no way 325 can
[2:20:52] reach there please
[2:20:53] ever here
[2:20:55] it's not working when we go to the third
[2:20:57] church ages
[2:20:59] when we blow it up
[2:21:01] we see that the third church ages start
[2:21:04] at 3 12
[2:21:05] and it goes all the way to 606
[2:21:08] we found out that 325 here is truly
[2:21:12] greater than 312 and it's less than 606
[2:21:16] so this is the perfect spot we can put
[2:21:18] it there
[2:21:19] any questions so far
[2:21:21] ever here if it's the perfect spot so
[2:21:24] 325 feet on the third church
[2:21:28] and marquia
[2:21:30] we can put it there
[2:21:31] so when brother branham is saying that
[2:21:34] this spirit of the worst horse started
[2:21:37] from the day of pentecost
[2:21:39] and it's going all the way to 325
[2:21:42] what brother problem is telling you is
[2:21:45] the first spirit which is the white
[2:21:47] horse rather cover the three churches
[2:21:51] any question
[2:21:53] are we okay
[2:21:54] did i lose anybody
[2:21:56] so this spirit
[2:21:58] stopped on emphasis and went into uh uh
[2:22:02] esmuno and went into pergamus and when
[2:22:05] he went into programs the devil changed
[2:22:08] hosts
[2:22:10] you follow me
[2:22:12] he left the white horse and he picked up
[2:22:14] another horse
[2:22:16] everybody here so far
[2:22:18] but when the devil is attacking like
[2:22:21] this
[2:22:22] because we have four horses
[2:22:25] the first horse is which color
[2:22:28] that's why i told you read revelation 6
[2:22:32] the second one is what
[2:22:35] the third one is water
[2:22:37] the fourth one is water
[2:22:40] ever care
[2:22:41] how many
[2:22:42] how many beasts do we have
[2:22:45] in the side of god
[2:22:46] the first one is water
[2:22:49] the second one is water
[2:22:51] the third one is what
[2:22:53] man the fourth one is water
[2:22:58] everybody here
[2:23:00] these four beasts brother bottom say a
[2:23:03] beast in the bible represents a power so
[2:23:06] the devil is using power
[2:23:08] to destroy the church of the living god
[2:23:12] but here god could not stand quiet
[2:23:16] anybody here god have to react
[2:23:21] [Music]
[2:23:23] hallelujah
[2:23:24] in 325 he was given a crown so when god
[2:23:28] reacted what happened brother branham
[2:23:31] say as the antichrist went well how many
[2:23:35] on his beast of ministry
[2:23:37] god sent forth how many beasts
[2:23:40] a beast to combat him for
[2:23:43] every time the beast rode on his horse
[2:23:46] the antichrist wrote on his walls on his
[2:23:49] beast to announce his ministry god sent
[2:23:52] his beast also on and he was on that to
[2:23:56] announce his combat to
[2:23:58] it when the enemy comes in like a flood
[2:24:03] the spirit of the lord raises a water
[2:24:06] in other words there is an action too
[2:24:09] there is a reaction to the action ever
[2:24:11] here when the devil attack and he's
[2:24:14] using the white house god look he said
[2:24:17] which number is he using
[2:24:19] he said let me match him up
[2:24:22] he said lion
[2:24:23] go ahead
[2:24:25] hey
[2:24:26] hey so so when the enemy went out as
[2:24:31] antichrist god sent a certain type of
[2:24:34] power out to meet him
[2:24:37] he went out as a red horse another color
[2:24:40] another power another ministry god sent
[2:24:43] another one after him to combat him to
[2:24:46] hold water
[2:24:47] to protect his church so when he comes
[2:24:50] as the white horse rather god attacked
[2:24:53] with a lion
[2:24:58] did i lose anybody
[2:25:00] did i lose anyone
[2:25:04] hallelujah
[2:25:06] after 3 25 the devil changed his
[2:25:09] ministry
[2:25:11] remember under the white house rather
[2:25:14] the devil all he wants to do is to
[2:25:17] remove the holy ghost
[2:25:21] anybody here
[2:25:23] from the church and back here
[2:25:25] what is he doing when he changed colors
[2:25:28] brother branham said the doctrine of the
[2:25:30] nicolaitan the same thing that started
[2:25:33] then we found out it was deed to begin
[2:25:36] with
[2:25:36] in the next church age he became a water
[2:25:40] and then he become a water
[2:25:44] a physical assault
[2:25:50] did that lose anybody did i lose anybody
[2:25:54] did i lose anybody
[2:25:56] did i lose anybody
[2:25:58] the first thing removing the closing off
[2:26:02] then the physical absolute

[2:26:20] everqueer
[2:26:22] i'm preaching the seals right now
[2:26:24] but here
[2:26:25] brother branham say i am calling for the
[2:26:28] mortyology
[2:26:29] from the time of saint augustine of
[2:26:33] apple until water
[2:26:37] brother branham said it start from saint
[2:26:39] augustine
[2:26:41] of harper
[2:26:43] until what
[2:26:44] 1586
[2:26:46] we need to find out when this man was
[2:26:48] born
[2:26:50] ever here
[2:26:52] brother adam said on the roman
[2:26:54] meteorology the roman catholic church
[2:26:56] put 68 million protestants to die
[2:27:01] was he sold red
[2:27:03] was there was he riding a red horse
[2:27:06] what was it the same power
[2:27:09] the same rudder there is this seal
[2:27:12] they admit 68 million on the meteorology
[2:27:16] beside all those put to death outside of
[2:27:18] that during the dark ages there were
[2:27:21] millions fed to lion and slaughter in
[2:27:24] every way because they would not bow
[2:27:26] down to the catholic dogma
[2:27:32] give me more from the second seal that
[2:27:34] was broke last night he had taken peace
[2:27:37] from of the earth and did kill one
[2:27:39] another his own meteorology of the roman
[2:27:42] catholic church show that they put 68
[2:27:45] million protest and death from the time
[2:27:48] of who sent augustine of hapo until 1570
[2:27:54] something
[2:27:56] he said 86 he said
[2:27:59] 1580 something about here
[2:28:03] now 68 million
[2:28:05] recorded on meteorology when one of
[2:28:09] their so-called sent got the revelation
[2:28:12] that anybody that disagree with the
[2:28:14] roman church should die as a heretic
[2:28:16] it's this man that did it and he was the

[2:28:57] church ought and must use force if
[2:29:00] necessary bring her children back to the

[2:29:49] he's saying what
[2:29:51] take me as a dutchman
[2:29:54] i'm putting all of this so nobody come
[2:29:56] to you after church and say your prophet
[2:29:59] say here this way that's why i'm
[2:30:01] vaccinated
[2:30:04] everybody here
[2:30:05] he lasted till 1850 the massacre of what
[2:30:10] if you go in history the massacre of
[2:30:14] harlem
[2:30:16] happened in 1580.
[2:30:19] brother branham just flipped numbers
[2:30:22] i'm saying that so when they tell you
[2:30:24] you know what to answer everybody here
[2:30:27] so the time of to let me say that one
[2:30:30] 354 to
[2:30:32] 1580. he put it 1850. according to the
[2:30:35] history and back here there were 68
[2:30:38] million protestants same concept put to
[2:30:41] death recorded on the roman meteorology
[2:30:44] for disagreeing with the pope rome
[2:30:47] now if we go back to our chart here 350
[2:30:51] is right here
[2:30:53] anybody care now
[2:30:54] anybody here
[2:30:56] and if you look at the edge of sardis
[2:30:59] and you pull it out here it starts from
[2:31:01] 1520 to
[2:31:03] 1750. what random say it's 1580. you can
[2:31:07] see it feeling ready
[2:31:09] everybody here
[2:31:10] so when we put it there we come so right
[2:31:12] there you can see that the second seal
[2:31:15] started right in the middle here and
[2:31:18] went all the way there
[2:31:19] it looks like the seals start in the
[2:31:22] edge
[2:31:22] and it's finishing the edge and another
[2:31:24] one pick up in the middle of the
[2:31:27] brother branham called that overlapping
[2:31:30] i already preached to you about that
[2:31:31] ever here so when he said the red horse
[2:31:35] rather he start assaulting the christian
[2:31:39] now no more speaking the word now he's
[2:31:41] assaulting the christian physically
[2:31:44] killing them
[2:31:45] god have to react
[2:31:47] what did god react
[2:31:49] every time a religious power went forth
[2:31:51] to meet the challenge of the political
[2:31:53] power of the world when the lion was up
[2:31:56] the religious power he went to meet the
[2:31:58] roman power then when he come to the
[2:32:00] sacrifice hour the ox went because he is
[2:32:04] a sacrifice beast of the water
[2:32:07] so when he comes like a red horse rather
[2:32:10] god sent the ox anointing
[2:32:12] and not
[2:32:13] is a sacrifice for what
[2:32:16] a beast of sacrifice that's why you saw
[2:32:19] christian
[2:32:20] accepted to die for the death of christ
[2:32:23] ever here they were not doing that by
[2:32:26] their own power
[2:32:28] the anointing that came in
[2:32:30] was an anointing of sacrifice
[2:32:33] that's why when they want to queen
[2:32:35] christian the christian went slowly
[2:32:38] and they cut their head and they were
[2:32:40] singing the glory of god
[2:32:42] everybody here death where is your sin
[2:32:46] death where grave where is your water
[2:32:48] it was not a problem with them you
[2:32:51] cannot combat the devil on yourself
[2:32:54] you need to be under an anointing
[2:32:56] [Applause]
[2:32:58] everyone cares so far did i lose anyone
[2:33:02] blessed be the name of the lord
[2:33:04] brother branham the second age was the
[2:33:07] red horse rather which was the dark ages
[2:33:10] the next age was the who
[2:33:13] the third beast
[2:33:15] the edge of one which was the water
[2:33:19] he was the edge of the water
[2:33:23] but the one that was speaking in the age
[2:33:26] was represented as a man that is wisdom
[2:33:29] smart shoot
[2:33:31] but the bottoms continue he said the
[2:33:33] reformer down through the church ages
[2:33:36] come the face of a man and the reformer
[2:33:39] has been seized who
[2:33:42] in green and then

[2:33:46] on down to water
[2:33:48] [Music]

[2:33:57] killed he killed he killed he killed he
[2:34:00] got tired the christian are still
[2:34:03] increasing in number
[2:34:04] he said this is not working then he
[2:34:07] flipped and then he changed
[2:34:09] he changed the horse to a black one and
[2:34:11] the black one brother branham said from
[2:34:13] the church the dark ages all the way to
[2:34:16] the pentecosta which goes right there
[2:34:19] that brings the third the black horse
[2:34:22] ever here it is the edge of the reformer
[2:34:25] did i lose somebody
[2:34:30] he's saying
[2:34:31] in revelation 3 the bible say remember

[2:35:19] in the age of luther the church was half
[2:35:22] dead
[2:35:28] everybody okay
[2:35:29] and not only that when they opened the
[2:35:32] third seal about here and the black
[2:35:35] horse was coming
[2:35:37] and begin to destroy now the element of
[2:35:40] the church
[2:35:41] god screams from his throne
[2:35:47] god sent a measure of penny for a
[2:35:50] measure of wheat but touch not the water
[2:35:54] and the what

[2:36:14] call out
[2:36:15] dare come to see what it is he was in
[2:36:18] there in these living creatures and he
[2:36:21] wore and he saw the black horse
[2:36:23] the voice in the midst of the four
[2:36:25] beasts call out a measure of pain and of
[2:36:27] which for water
[2:36:29] three measures of valley for water
[2:36:32] wheat is what would make bread
[2:36:34] barley they make bread with it
[2:36:36] both barley and wheat three measure cuts
[2:36:39] to water
[2:36:40] a penny but see that you heard not water
[2:36:45] what is a penny
[2:36:50] brother branham says this uh the bible
[2:36:52] says this in matthew 20 verse 1 for the
[2:36:56] kingdom of heaven
[2:36:57] [Music]
[2:36:59] i need to change the title so you can
[2:37:01] remember this sermon pretty good

[2:37:06] good samaritan

[2:37:10] everybody okay
[2:37:12] so you're gonna trace it quickly
[2:37:14] everybody okay
[2:37:15] he said that the kingdom of heaven
[2:37:18] is like unto a man
[2:37:20] that is a household holder which went
[2:37:23] out early in the morning to hire a
[2:37:25] laborer into his water
[2:37:28] and when he agreed with the labor for a
[2:37:30] water a penny a water a penny was a
[2:37:34] salary of a whole day
[2:37:38] how can a bread
[2:37:40] cost the salary of a whole day
[2:37:42] it is a time of famine
[2:37:44] that's when inflation hit
[2:37:46] and the price goes up
[2:37:50] everybody okay everybody okay
[2:37:52] that's why brother branham say that the
[2:37:55] third seal is water
[2:38:00] you got it now
[2:38:01] but that's not the water
[2:38:04] and the water
[2:38:05] why the order and the one
[2:38:07] but symbolizing spirit
[2:38:10] all symbolize the spirit
[2:38:13] and one is water
[2:38:19] daddy dust spill with your
[2:38:25] water here ever here the antichrist
[2:38:30] enter and begin to play with the bread
[2:38:33] with the word of god
[2:38:35] with the stuff of life
[2:38:37] when god look he said you can touch that
[2:38:40] one but do not touch the oil and do not
[2:38:43] touch the wine don't touch the holy
[2:38:46] ghost
[2:38:48] and don't touch the joy
[2:38:50] [Music]
[2:38:50] [Applause]
[2:38:53] everybody here
[2:38:55] david says listen
[2:38:57] he said cast me not away
[2:39:00] from the presence
[2:39:02] and take note the water
[2:39:05] from me and restore unto me the water
[2:39:12] not to restore unto me my salvation
[2:39:17] by the joy of my salvation
[2:39:22] everybody here everybody here why go
[2:39:25] your way
[2:39:27] eat the fat drink the sweet send portion
[2:39:30] unto them that was nothing that for whom
[2:39:33] nothing is prepared for this day is holy
[2:39:36] unto the lord neither be water
[2:39:40] for the water
[2:39:42] the joy of the lord is water
[2:39:49] you may have the holy ghost but you can
[2:39:52] go down in your spirit
[2:39:55] everybody here
[2:39:56] but when you climb the mountain by the
[2:39:59] polycarp
[2:40:01] and you go into the mountain
[2:40:03] climbing the mountain is a hard thing
[2:40:06] but when you get to the top of the
[2:40:08] mountain
[2:40:10] then the joy of the lord comes
[2:40:12] and that joy gives you strength
[2:40:16] that's why you come to church sad but as
[2:40:19] you live in the church you feel like you
[2:40:22] are charged
[2:40:23] the joy of the lord
[2:40:25] is giving you strength
[2:40:27] straight for the journey
[2:40:31] [Music]
[2:40:32] i'm sorry
[2:40:35] give me time so i can land
[2:40:37] ever here
[2:40:38] ever here

[2:40:43] the lord is our strength
[2:40:45] that is our strength that is how we live
[2:40:47] is by the joy of the lord that is in our
[2:40:51] water
[2:40:52] wow what is causing that joy brother
[2:40:54] branham
[2:40:55] he said the power
[2:40:57] of revelation
[2:40:59] brings water
[2:41:01] [Applause]
[2:41:04] [Music]
[2:41:07] everybody here
[2:41:08] that's why when you are down at home
[2:41:11] going through many trouble and the
[2:41:14] pillar in the tape is playing
[2:41:16] and suddenly something struck you from
[2:41:19] the top
[2:41:20] and it brings you joy
[2:41:22] [Applause]
[2:41:27] ever hear when they are preaching the
[2:41:29] word there is something in you
[2:41:32] that is kind of happy
[2:41:34] and when it's happy
[2:41:36] you are forgetting the time
[2:41:38] you are forgetting how tired you are
[2:41:41] you don't want to get away with it it is
[2:41:44] the joy of the lord
[2:41:46] it is the power of the revelation
[2:41:49] it is the one of the stimulation
[2:41:52] [Applause]
[2:41:53] [Music]
[2:41:54] hallelujah
[2:41:56] do you know the reason why the disciple
[2:41:58] went in the upper room
[2:42:00] because they were afraid
[2:42:03] but when the holy ghost came
[2:42:05] and stimulated them
[2:42:07] they came like junker
[2:42:10] [Applause]
[2:42:13] everybody here
[2:42:15] everybody here
[2:42:16] it's like a story i heard before
[2:42:19] of a cat that was chasing the mouse
[2:42:22] and the mouse was running
[2:42:24] and suddenly the mouse fell into wine
[2:42:27] and when he drank wine he was no more
[2:42:30] afraid of the cat he came to the cat
[2:42:33] looking at the cat like this
[2:42:35] and the cat began to back up
[2:42:40] [Applause]
[2:42:42] because it's the power of the
[2:42:45] stimulation of the revelation
[2:42:48] [Applause]
[2:42:50] everybody here
[2:42:52] that's why when david came
[2:42:54] when he read goliath speaking
[2:42:57] revelation struck david
[2:43:00] the height of goliath was nothing
[2:43:02] the weapon of goliath was laughing david
[2:43:05] look at goliath he said these are
[2:43:07] circumcised
[2:43:09] he got the revelation that was hidden
[2:43:13] behind the clubs of
[2:43:17] [Applause]
[2:43:21] ever goliath
[2:43:22] he said go light i'm gonna catch your
[2:43:24] head

[2:43:28] bruise the head
[2:43:30] i need your head
[2:43:31] [Applause]
[2:43:34] give me time i'm gonna let you know
[2:43:37] hallelujah
[2:43:38] the power of wine
[2:43:40] natural wine is to do what
[2:43:43] is to bring a present that is all
[2:43:46] slumped down to
[2:43:48] water that's why it's good to come to
[2:43:51] church
[2:43:53] when you down don't stay home
[2:43:55] go to church so they can stimulate you
[2:43:58] and when you go home you're ready to
[2:44:00] fight again

[2:44:07] the world give stimulation of joy to the
[2:44:11] believer stimulation of water
[2:44:14] stimulation that is water

[2:45:25] the plague could hit egypt
[2:45:28] but not goshen

[2:46:47] color
[2:46:48] plus the black color that's what is
[2:46:51] giving you the water

[2:51:09] ever here john 6
[2:51:11] jesus answered them have i not choose
[2:51:14] you to have and one of you is a water
[2:51:17] he was a devil
[2:51:19] [Music]
[2:51:22] so the fifth spirit
[2:51:24] came from the devil
[2:51:25] from the son of position he spoke of
[2:51:28] judas is carrying the son of salmon for
[2:51:31] he was that should betray him being one
[2:51:34] of the water
[2:51:35] ever here
[2:51:36] now he that is washed needed not safe to
[2:51:39] wash his feet but he's clean every week
[2:51:42] he are clean but not what
[2:51:44] for he knew who should betray him
[2:51:46] therefore he said you are not all water
[2:51:49] clean judah was not clean
[2:51:52] he was a devil and he was also a fifth
[2:51:56] if the spirit of a thief come upon you
[2:52:00] what are you going to do
[2:52:03] so if thieves attack him
[2:52:07] they got the spirit from
[2:52:12] who everybody here
[2:52:15] brother branham said in his time the
[2:52:18] revelation at the breaking of the seals
[2:52:21] we know exactly what he was who the man
[2:52:23] of iniquity who is this man of sin this
[2:52:26] fellow that is working iniquity but he
[2:52:28] be revealed in his time the mystery of
[2:52:31] iniquity does already work deceiver
[2:52:34] deceiving the people only he god
[2:52:37] that letter with less until dear
[2:52:40] christ the bride be taken out of the way
[2:52:45] amen by removing the holy ghost then
[2:52:47] shall the wicked one be water at the
[2:52:50] breaking of the seals at his time paul
[2:52:53] say not in my time but in the time when
[2:52:57] he shall be what
[2:52:58] in the end time ever here let me rush
[2:53:01] now to the airport the coming of the
[2:53:03] lord and the gathering of him as god
[2:53:06] will gather his people to him in the
[2:53:08] last day the gathering of the people of
[2:53:10] the lord not to the church
[2:53:12] to the lord gathering together unto him
[2:53:16] the man of sin the man of sin be
[2:53:18] revealed the son of perdition that was
[2:53:21] who
[2:53:23] i'm going to skip this because you
[2:53:25] already got the son of perdition what am
[2:53:27] i saying brother of adam say
[2:53:29] while jesus was upon the earth so was
[2:53:32] judas
[2:53:33] each came from a different spirit
[2:53:36] and upon death each went to his own
[2:53:38] water
[2:53:39] judah came from here
[2:53:42] jesus came from heaven
[2:53:44] god filled
[2:53:46] jesus with the fullness of the godhead
[2:53:49] badly
[2:53:50] and the devil also filled judah with the
[2:53:53] fullness of the devil badly
[2:53:56] but here that's why judah was a devil
[2:54:00] here so when jesus died
[2:54:03] judah could not stay that's why he hang
[2:54:05] himself
[2:54:06] so the spirit of jesus going back to the
[2:54:09] father and the spirit of judah going
[2:54:11] back to hell so on the day of pentecost
[2:54:15] the spirit of jesus came back on the
[2:54:17] children of god the spirit of judah came
[2:54:21] also back in the church
[2:54:25] the spirit of jesus led they came back
[2:54:28] upon the true church and the spirit of
[2:54:31] who
[2:54:33] came back on the water
[2:54:35] right there in revelation water
[2:54:37] in other words the seals were judas
[2:54:41] back again in the church everybody here
[2:54:44] see how that judah spirit came back as
[2:54:47] hell
[2:54:49] on the water
[2:54:50] he was white so close to the real just
[2:54:53] as judah was so close to jesus a crown
[2:54:57] was given to him white horse water
[2:55:00] so when the church started
[2:55:02] judah came here and judah was a fifth
[2:55:05] and when this man started his journey
[2:55:08] coming down from jerusalem because of
[2:55:10] the spirit of judah coming also
[2:55:13] following the journey of the church
[2:55:15] the fifth spirit attack him
[2:55:17] number one trying to remove his clothes
[2:55:20] take the holy ghost off the church and
[2:55:22] number two get into persecution
[2:55:25] and try to kill the man and leaving him
[2:55:27] half dead
[2:55:29] any question so far
[2:55:31] any questions so far
[2:55:33] our sin
[2:55:34] is a very cursed city jericho is in the
[2:55:37] valley jerusalem is on the hill and a
[2:55:40] man like we read in the good samaritan
[2:55:42] when he was coming down from jerusalem
[2:55:44] going to jericho he was backsliding
[2:55:47] coming out of the city of the blessed
[2:55:49] going to the city of the curse and that
[2:55:52] when he fell among the thieves and gas
[2:55:54] strip and wounded laying water
[2:55:57] meaning spiritually
[2:55:59] and physically
[2:56:01] ever here
[2:56:02] back home so i can land this plane
[2:56:05] ever here hey
[2:56:08] we found out that the three seals
[2:56:10] happened under these fields
[2:56:12] back here and normally when you travel
[2:56:15] you travel with a purse
[2:56:19] jesus said
[2:56:21] to the disciple take nothing for your
[2:56:23] journey
[2:56:25] neither staff script neither bag bread
[2:56:28] neither money nor to coat
[2:56:30] so this man has a bag
[2:56:32] that he was traveling with
[2:56:34] and that bag has money
[2:56:36] and they took money off which was faith
[2:56:39] the origin of faith that started in
[2:56:41] pentecost
[2:56:42] the fifth remove it but i will wish toll
[2:56:46] [Music]
[2:56:47] say the lord ever here so this man was
[2:56:51] left half dead
[2:56:52] then came the priest
[2:56:55] and then came delivered
[2:56:57] the first one was a priest
[2:56:59] the second one was delivered
[2:57:02] ever here
[2:57:04] both of these represented
[2:57:10] you remember
[2:57:11] you remember
[2:57:12] you remember but the levitical
[2:57:14] priesthood cannot help
[2:57:17] and the mercy
[2:57:23] that's why they could not do anything
[2:57:25] [Applause]
[2:57:27] they love moses cannot work on you
[2:57:29] anymore
[2:57:33] everybody okay
[2:57:35] everybody okay
[2:57:38] paul's wolf had become nicolaitan
[2:57:42] they were trying to form a priesthood
[2:57:46] like the water
[2:57:47] [Music]
[2:57:48] which was for ran to the new testament
[2:57:51] to utter
[2:57:52] they're trying to bring the levitical
[2:57:54] priesthood under mercy the priesthood
[2:57:58] while the high priest was already
[2:58:00] disqualified
[2:58:02] by tearing his clothes out everybody so
[2:58:04] far let me rush quickly
[2:58:07] saying that our lord sprung out of the
[2:58:09] nation that no not moses never even
[2:58:12] spoke of him came out of the priesthood
[2:58:14] our lord sprung out of the tribe of
[2:58:16] judah not out of liver for they were
[2:58:19] carnal legalists
[2:58:22] can use legalistic
[2:58:24] and the melchizedek but our lord came
[2:58:27] out of judah
[2:58:28] there you are where the promise was what
[2:58:31] so the levitical priesthood could not do
[2:58:34] anything through the church ages
[2:58:37] we need another priest
[2:58:39] who can be the one who can feel who can
[2:58:41] have compassion
[2:58:43] that's why the good samaritan when he
[2:58:45] comes
[2:58:46] he comes with compassion
[2:58:50] ever here somebody that can understand
[2:58:53] the ignorant and somebody that can
[2:58:56] understand those that are out of the way
[2:58:58] but here so far so we found the
[2:59:01] samaritan coming
[2:59:05] why is samaritan
[2:59:08] lord help me
[2:59:10] brother obama say
[2:59:12] we know there is only three
[2:59:14] nationalities of people

[2:59:30] and what
[2:59:32] [Music]
[2:59:33] [Applause]

[2:59:35] ever here
[2:59:37] the lord
[2:59:39] have to come as a samaritan
[2:59:42] because the body of a samaritan
[2:59:45] has a mystery
[2:59:47] it's a body
[2:59:49] that have jews and gentiles
[2:59:51] into one body
[2:59:53] he has a blood offered jew and a blood
[2:59:56] of agenda

[3:00:28] and this man was a good water
[3:00:32] do we know his name
[3:00:34] [Music]
[3:00:36] do you know his name he was a good
[3:00:39] samaritan
[3:00:43] the bible says in mark 10 and when he
[3:00:46] had gone forth into the way
[3:00:48] there came one running and knelt down
[3:00:51] and ask him what
[3:00:53] what shall i do that i mean with what
[3:00:57] and jesus said unto him what causes me
[3:01:00] what
[3:01:01] there is none water
[3:01:03] but who is good
[3:01:04] so the good samaritan is who you are
[3:01:12] [Applause]
[3:01:18] brother branham he said
[3:01:20] the fourth mystery of the new testament
[3:01:23] church as one body
[3:01:28] one man
[3:01:29] composed of what
[3:01:31] and not water that's why he came as a
[3:01:34] samaritan because that's a
[3:01:35] representation of his church the church
[3:01:38] started jerusalem with jewish people
[3:01:40] first
[3:01:41] and then we gentile begin together so
[3:01:44] the body of jesus christ which is the
[3:01:47] church of jesus christ content jews and
[3:01:50] gentiles when we go in the rapture we
[3:01:53] are going to win the rapture with paul

[3:01:59] jews and gentiles together that's the
[3:02:02] body of jesus christ that's the body of
[3:02:05] the good samaritan
[3:02:11] hallelujah
[3:02:12] hallelujah the bible said that at the
[3:02:15] time you were without christ being alien
[3:02:18] from the commonwealth of israel and
[3:02:21] stranger from the covenant of the prayer
[3:02:23] of promise having no hope without god in
[3:02:26] the world but now in christ
[3:02:29] jesus

[3:02:45] of partition between

[3:02:49] and that he let me go here having
[3:02:51] abolished in the flesh the enmity even
[3:02:55] the law of commandment contained in
[3:02:57] ordinances for to make in himself

[3:03:30] apostle and prophet by the water
[3:03:33] what is the mystery that there
[3:03:36] should be water
[3:03:38] and of the same
[3:03:40] the same

[3:04:01] hallelujah
[3:04:03] then he pick up the man and put him on
[3:04:05] his horse
[3:04:06] every year then he switched the ministry
[3:04:10] from himself
[3:04:12] to a host
[3:04:15] ever here because throughout the seven
[3:04:18] church churches
[3:04:19] he was son of god
[3:04:21] he was a priest
[3:04:23] but before his coming
[3:04:25] in between son of god
[3:04:28] and son of david he have to come back
[3:04:31] again
[3:04:32] as a son of man
[3:04:34] not his body but a host
[3:04:38] a host
[3:04:39] another person
[3:04:41] must take on his ministry
[3:04:44] to bring the redemption and the
[3:04:46] restoration
[3:04:48] of the body of jesus christ
[3:04:51] and right here
[3:04:53] ever here he must move from son of god
[3:04:57] over here and come back as son of man
[3:05:01] it is not him but is his ministry and he
[3:05:05] take the ministry and he give it to a
[3:05:07] host
[3:05:08] ever here
[3:05:10] ever here and the host now is the one
[3:05:13] taking care of the body
[3:05:15] he's the one taking care of the church
[3:05:19] [Music]
[3:05:20] [Applause]
[3:05:22] i gotta stop somewhere ever here ever
[3:05:25] here the host
[3:05:27] is not jesus christ
[3:05:29] but the roster is revealing jesus christ
[3:05:33] to you
[3:05:36] [Applause]
[3:05:42] hallelujah
[3:05:44] hallelujah oh my god
[3:05:47] hallelujah
[3:05:49] the good samaritan
[3:05:51] [Applause]
[3:05:53] the bible saying
[3:05:55] remember the good samaritan that found
[3:05:59] the man wounded he brought him in the
[3:06:01] water
[3:06:02] which is what
[3:06:04] [Music]
[3:06:07] which church
[3:06:09] which church
[3:06:11] the church that have a host
[3:06:13] so for complete redemption
[3:06:16] you cannot receive it under baptism
[3:06:19] not on the methodist you must look for a
[3:06:22] church
[3:06:23] that has a host
[3:06:31] [Applause]
[3:06:33] hallelujah
[3:06:34] and gave the man
[3:06:36] two persons and told him if he needed
[3:06:40] more i will pay him when i come and he
[3:06:43] got two pences he's able to do what
[3:06:47] i thought the doctor was him
[3:06:51] the son of righteousness shall rise
[3:06:54] with healing
[3:06:56] with healing
[3:07:00] everybody here
[3:07:01] if he is the man of god that stand on
[3:07:04] god's word he's got what god give him

[3:07:10] the anointed world there
[3:07:12] ever here how is what we are to worship
[3:07:16] in water
[3:07:17] and in water ever here so they gave him
[3:07:20] two passes
[3:07:22] but to the host they also gave him
[3:07:25] another power
[3:07:27] they said there is another money
[3:07:29] that is not revealed
[3:07:33] the first money is the spirit in the
[3:07:36] world
[3:07:37] but there is another money
[3:07:39] it still belongs to the master
[3:07:41] but that money must be revealed by the
[3:07:44] host
[3:07:45] the host is the one that take the two
[3:07:47] pences but he can pull out the money out
[3:07:50] of the two pencils
[3:07:52] are the revelation from the bible
[3:07:56] that if you look like this
[3:07:58] you cannot see it in the bible
[3:08:00] it's the horse that must reveal that
[3:08:03] revelation to you
[3:08:05] [Applause]
[3:08:07] everybody everybody okay because brother
[3:08:10] problem said money represented faith
[3:08:14] it is the precious power so there is
[3:08:16] another faith
[3:08:18] that must be revealed
[3:08:20] by the host and that faith is what you
[3:08:23] need for the coming of the good
[3:08:25] samaritan
[3:08:26] it is the rapturing faith that you need
[3:08:30] to meet the coming of the good samaritan
[3:08:34] into the air let's stand we gotta stop
