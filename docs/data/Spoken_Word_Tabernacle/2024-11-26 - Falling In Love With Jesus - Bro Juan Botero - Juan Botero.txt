walked in and you talked to me brother and the singing and and the freedom of the spirit I certainly feel at home and uh it's my first time here at this church and I you know I'd like to read a quote just to start and and and let you all know what I believe amen and and when I when I go to a new church I like to read this quote and you know I think I'm going to start making it a habit AIT every single new church read this quote because it can be you know when a a new Minister comes by can be a little jittery you're kind of feeling them out so you know it's important to know what you're listening to and brother brandom says in questions and answers yes in 64 he says and we do have today by God's help that's right the perfect interpretation of the word with Divine Vindication amen and I I already know that's what this church believes that this message we heard the sister sing is our absolute it's our armor it's what's holding us and brother Brandon preached over and over that this message is the power that'll take us in a Rapture hey man you know brother I was at brother Josh's this Sunday and he told me get your preaching boots on because they're going to preach you and I'm already feeling it so I feel free and I know we believe the same and that's that this message is our absolute and we are not ashamed right we're not not ashamed of the cloud we're not ashamed of the Prophet we're not ashamed of the pillar of fire and we believe that same Pillar of Fire is here tonight and not only is he here tonight but he goes with each and every one of us home he's the one that protects us he watches over our families and brother there may be prodigals that have left the church but that same Pillar of Fire will go after them and he'll bring them back I believe it amen so let's turn to the Bible Genesis CH 24 glory to God Amen I've been here five minutes and three people told me to take off my coat so I'm I'm just taking it off now yes my brother Genesis 24 yes my brother we're going to read verses 1-9 amen amen amen hallelujah glory to God it says and Abraham was old and well stricken in age and the Lord had blessed him in All Things yes and Abraham said unto the eldest servant of his house that ruled over all that he had put I pray thee thy hand under my thigh go ahead and I will make thee swear by the Lord the god of Heaven and the god of the earth that thou shalt not take a wife unto my son of the daughters of the Canaanites among whom I dwell that's but Thou shalt go into my country and unto my Kindred and take a wife unto my son Isaac in other words you're going to take a wife that's how I am a wife that has my character I don't want a wife that's of the world of Canaan I don't want a wife that's marred by the world but I want you to go take a wife that comes from me and he says and the servant said unto him peradventure the woman will not be willing to follow me into this land must I needs bring thy son again unto the lands from when thou camest and Abraham said Beware that thou bring not my son thither again the Lord God Of Heaven which took me from my father's house and from the land of my Kindred and which spake unto me and that swear unto me saying unto thy seed will I give this land he shall send his Angel before thee and thou shalt take a wife unto my son from thence amen so who was going to go before him this wasn't just a servant coming to pick a random woman right but this was a pre-ordained moment and before the servant even went God said I'll send my angel to get a prepared woman and he says and if the woman is not willing to follow thee then you're clear from this my oath only bring not my son thither again you may have your seats glory to God so we know that brother brandham talks about and he types this with with the Elijah messenger that would come and and and that was brother brandom that would come to to gather a bride that's right and we know brother Brandon preached and even on on the Thanksgiving message he preached about the invisible Union and he said the the most thankful thing we can think of is that God has chosen us and he's given us Redemption that's right and brother Brandon preached about choosing of a bride and he took this scripture and he said God when you see a man choose a wife the wife what she displays shows what's in the man and he said and that types the spiritual that God is going to take a bride but the type of bride that he'll take shows exactly what God is and what is God God is the word so brother Brandon said this bride that he's come to take has to be a word bride not a denominational bride not a bride from the world or that tries to make her own way but a bride that's just like him that's exactly like brother brandham said at the words of God on the lips of a true Holy Ghost filled believer when they speak it he said it's the same as deity speaking and why is that because the bride is made of the same material that God is made of That's So brother the brother brother Steven asked me for the title of this sermon and I said Falling In Love With Jesus because I don't believe that God sent a prophet and a message to gather abro that wouldn't love him but when God sent a message it went to gather of people that would be so given up so surrendered to him that they would love him above everything else that's right so I believe the Bride of Jesus Christ more than ever has to fall in love with Jesus and the Bible says he sent his begotten son Jesus who was the word so more than ever before the bride has to be in love with the message exact with the word because the message is Jesus you know they came and asked Jesus came and asked Peter and he said who does man say that I am and Peter started saying some Say You're Just a a Prophet Elijah some Say You're Just John some say you're just the master some say you're all these things but then Jesus looked at on the word and said but who do you say I am I no longer want to know what they say I am but I want to know a person testimony of who you say I am and Jesus looked at him and brother brandham said brother brandham said Peter didn't know him by Flesh and Blood brother brandom said Peter didn't know him because he walked with him and he saw him but Peter knew him by Revelation he said Flesh and Blood because Peter said Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God and Jesus looked at him the word and said Flesh and Blood hasn't revealed this to you but my Father in Heaven because if Flesh and Blood had revealed it to him he could fall away if Flesh and Blood had revealed it to him he could leave the message but when it's a revelation in your heart there is nothing on Earth that can shake you they can say what they want about the pictures they can say what they want on the internet but when it's revealed unto you and you've seen it alive more than just a word but the word made flesh in your life brother this message works this message is the truth we've seen it take Sinners and save them and raise them up make preachers out of them make wives out of them make Godly mothers out of them that's what this message does your denom ation the world and denomination might reform you but this message does more than just reform you this message completely transforms you brother brandham said you become transformed and you might have had branches laying over you and you grew and you were Twisted because Satan wants to destroy you but when this message came by he loosed you loosed you from the power of the enemy loosed you from reasoning loose you from [Applause] denomination the bride will fall in love with Jesus and Jesus is the word so many people ashamed of a prophet but thank the Lord that we're not ashamed of God's messenger because it was God's messenger that he s to gather a bride and listen eler said what if she doesn't come and I started thinking about brother brandom when he saw the vision of the preview of the bride and he saw the first one go by the alpha church and she was beautiful to look about right long hair dressed properly clothed by the word but what followed after that was denominational and worldly churches right and I'm reminded brother brandom sat there stood and watched and he wept in his heart and he said is this all we could produce is this all the preaching that we did brother Brandon went from side to side of the country preaching and he thought is this all par Adventure she won't follow and the voice said Here Comes the preview of the the bride and all of a sudden here brother brandham looks up and here comes the Omega bride that's us that's us that believe the same as they believed and here she came and brother Brandon said she was marching to the step of the Gospel Onward Christian Soldiers marching ads to war brother brandom say she was so beautiful to look at she was just like the word say she would be you know what's the Vindication of this message to me more than anything more than a sign more than a s a symbol power more than a a manifestation because they can manifest but what's a indication of this message is that it took my life that was steeped in sin and it took me and it gave me mercy and it lined me up with the word notice aler came brother it wasn't a random woman because the angel had already gone brother brandham said the Angel Beat him by 30 minutes in other words she was there and there was already something maybe in a song service something just moving in her heart the Holy Spirit was already working because it was prepared land because this Angel wasn't just coming for any woman he was coming for a specific character for a woman that would fall in love with [Applause] Jesus and what was her character what was the character trait he asked for he said Lord let it be that the one that comes and gives me to drink and not only me to drink but gives my camels to drink in other words the one that's a servant the one that's willing to submit herself the one that's willing to not just take a part of it but to take the whole of it he says let that one be the one for my master brother brandom said when he came Rebecca hadn't heard the prayer had no clue what he was asking for but it was in her it was predestinated in her to do what the prophet said she would do will I find Faith he said when I come to Earth will I find Faith the bride can say yes because we believe a Vindicated Prophet a Vindicated message that will take us in a [Applause] [Music] Rapture she said I will give you the drink and all your camels she said just rest and she started working and working and you know what brother brandham said brother brandom said that she was watering the very power she was watering on a Tuesday night the very power that would take her to Horizon she was watering the Holy Spirit and the word that would one day carry her straight to glory and that's what we're doing in this convention we're watering the spirit and the word that we believe will take us in a r [Applause] brother brother Brandon preached the message he cares do you care right because now we're talking about Rebecca she cared that's she absolutely cared and the care that was in her the love that was in her didn't come from outside it wed up from the inside there was something in her she couldn't explain it and we can't explain it when others turn away we can't explain why we stick around why we stay the only thing we can say is something keeps holding me and it ain't me that's holding myself it's not me that's holding my family but it's Jesus that predestinated me to be a part of this [Applause] bride brother brandom said the bride will be bone of his bone flesh of his flesh that's why on a Tuesday night we can sit here and rejoice over the word we don't need worldly entertainment but we love the word more than anything on this Earth we love the word and we're submitted to the word and it feeds our souls brother brandom said the Holy Spirit feeds on the word she was preprepared ground it didn't matter what had happened in her life life it didn't matter what she had gone through it didn't matter how she was raised it didn't matter that her mom and her her father and her brother didn't have the same calling if you continue reading in the story The servant gives them precious gifts that's right so they had precious gifts but Rebecca wanted more than just a gift she wasn't satisfied just with gifts she wanted a real true experience and a marriage with Jesus and this bride wants more than just gifts we want the gifts but what we want is a true relationship with Jesus Christ and that's what this message [Applause] produces Falling In Love With Jesus Falling in Love with the word willing to water it yes sir day by day when times are good you water it when times are hard you water it you just keep watering this message and watch it it'll carry you all the way home you know brother Brandon talked about the the showdowns sir the Mount Caramel Showdown that's right the mount Transfiguration Showdown and every single one of those showdowns what it was was Jesus showing his word was true everything around it might have seemed like it wasn't making sense and it wasn't going to come to be but when The Showdown came Elijah stood and said at your command Lord you told me to do this and at your command let fire fall and Jesus Vindicated the message of a prophet when that fire fell and it consumed the sacrifice they didn't believe Jesus was the word born a fornication a sinner he you know his mother was in sin and they tried to hide and now he says he's he's just a Man from Nazareth but when he came to that mountain and there the disciples were and watched him and God came down and confirmed his word he said this is my beloved Son and every single believer will need a confirmation that God comes down and said this is my beloved Son and I am pleased to dwell in them brother that's the Holy Spirit when God comes down and confirms it you've spoken it you've said you're a Believer you said you're filled but when God comes down confirms that he says I am pleased to dwell in [Applause] you and when the Holy Spirit dwells in you it turns you to the word and can I say it turns you to this message which is the word to say we just have the message of a man and we just have about message message message and they could realize this message is the same that it's ever been it was in the Garden of Eden it was with Abraham it was that rock that followed the children of Israel in the wilderness and he came in flesh he gave his life for us and this day he came to take a [Applause] bride where the random says he cares do you care right the question isn't whether Jesus cares right that is not the question people say does Jesus love me Jesus Loves You Jesus loves even Sinners Rich Young Ruler came to him and said what do I do to have eternal life and the Bible says Jesus looking on him loved him but this Rich Young Ruler wasn't going to follow but he loved him so the question isn't whether Jesus loves you or not the question is do you love Jesus enough to follow him the question wasn't whether Jesus loved the Rich Young Ruler was it does the Rich Young Ruler love him enough Falling In Love With Jesus for God so greatly in the Amplified so greatly loved and dearly prized the world that he even gave his one and only begotten son that whosoever would believe and trust in him as a savior shall not perish but have eternal life so Jesus loves the world and he loves you but now the question then is do you love him right because if you love him and you if you love this word and if you let it take over your life there is no way you can turn Peter stood there and they were all turning 70 turned all these turned and Jesus looked at him and said will you go also and Peter looked around and said you know I'm a little confused right now I don't know what's going on why are my friends leaving but one thing I know that I'm not leaving because I believe you are the true Son of God and it wasn't something that he he just did of his own but it wed up within him so so how important is it to love him hallelu brother brandham says unless you are deeply sincere take your time and you cannot be sincere until you positive understand in other words you can't actually love him until you realize who he is right you can't actually love this message how you're supposed to because it'll take a special love of this message to take you in a Rapture it'll take a special love for what God has done in our day love and faith to believe that it is for me and it'll take me but unless you're positive am yes sir in your heart not in your mind but in your heart that this message is true then it doesn't matter what comes against your mind Jesus said Upon This Rock I'll build my church and what was that Revelation who Jesus was and the Revelation today is who Jesus is not here people get confused they call us manf followers but it's Jesus brother brandham said I was the only one that was near when he came by and brother Brandon might not be here now but that same Pillar of Fire is here and it's anointed a bride and it will carry us home that same Jesus the Capstone the head of the church has come and now the body of the church is following the head and brother Brandon said where the head turns the body goes with it if the head says healing for you the body says healing for me if the head says the prodigal will return the body says amen they will if the head tells me I don't need to be afraid then I just say Amen Lord I won't be afraid [Applause] brother brandham says if you're presuming or guessing or hoping so he said then there cannot be the depths of sincerity that God requires not sincerity that you ought to have but that God requires there's a sincerity on the part of the Bride that God absolutely requires because a a husband a man won't come to take a bride that doesn't love him what kind of a marriage is that to come and take a woman to be your wife and she doesn't love you to come and take a woman to be your wife that still wants to flirt with the world that still wants to flirt with denomination that still wants to go around town and do things that's not a wife he's looking for he's looking for a wife that is so dedicated to him completely sold out given to him that whatever he wants I want to do for him if he wants me to believe I'll believe if he wants me to stand I'll [Applause] Stand you know that's why they get confused and they think you just are woman beaters and you just have rules they don't realize we're in love and it's a supernatural love it's not a felio love but it's an agapo love that we're so in love that whatever God says through his Prophet We [Applause] Believe Eve was not the kind of wife he's looking for Eve is not the kind of bride God is looking for because Eve was willing to look another way when a greasy Slicker brother brandham said came by Eve was willing to listen and look and reason what she had no reason to because God had given her the word already she was already under headship and she gave it up to go after a greasy Slicker that brought death and brother brandom said we were born in sin because of them for no fault of our own we were sold into sin but he said when there's a seed in you you might have been born into your first nature no fault of your own but when that word comes over and that nature dies a new nature comes forth he said that was your original nature how it was supposed to be Satan likes to remind us of our past but that's the old nature that's dead and buried I have a new [Applause] nature but there's the devil is the enemy of your faith and in this last days Paul would talk to Timothy sir and he said for this know also that in the last days peril time shall come for men shall be lovers of their own selves not of God of their own selves Covetous boers proud blasphemers disobedient to parents unth thankful Unholy without natural affection truce Breakers false accusers incontinence Fierce despisers of those that are good despisers of the Bride what has the bride ever done that's bad all we've ever done is help all we've ever done is be the one that they call when they need prayer right they won't talk to you at all until they need prayer and then they know where to turn not because we're special but because they know where Jesus is they might not want to admit it but they know where Jesus is brother Bram said Jezebel might have not wanted to admit it but Elijah was her pastor and they might not want to admit it but this message is the message to this age both Believers and [Applause] unbelievers he said there'll be traitors highminded lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God that should not be the bride and that will not be the bride the bride will not be a lover of pleasure more than a lover of God no absolutely in Matthew 24 when Jesus is talking about the end time condition he says and then shall many be offended and shall betray one another and shall hate one another and many false prophets shall rise false preachers shall rise and shall deceive many he says and because iniquity will abound the love of many will get cold right because there's so much iniquity because there's so much iniquity and it's so easily accessible it's in your pocket you pull out a phone and there's iniquity you go on Instagram and there's iniquity you go on Facebook iniquity everywhere you go there's iniquity and because of that many are drawn to that and their love for the word their first love that the Bible says you left your first love they grow cold on that first love which is Jesus and start looking after others just like Eve did that's why it is so important to fall in love with Jesus to fall in love with the message which is [Applause] Jesus you know it's funny because I had this quote here in my notes already and I was walking through the woods yesterday morning with my little boys and we're going exploring it's huge Woods to them it's not that big but when they're little they're explorers and I had my oldest he's seven then my 5-year-old and my three-year-old well my three-year-old I mean the they can be pretty steep and slippery and and all these leaves and so you know I have to hold him and watch him carefully but then I also had my you know my nephew also little also had to watch him and so we're going and every step we take I'm saying follow me and there's something about little kids that you say follow me and they think it means lead go forward but that's not what a parent means when a parent says follow me he means follow me don't try to make your own way follow me because if you try to make your own way you'll fall you'll get hurt and this message came so that we would follow it not to try to make our own way because if we make our own way we'll be in hell but if we follow this message he will make sure we make it all right can I just say to everybody that's afraid it's going to be okay Satan might have attacked you with fear and anxiety but I want to say by the holy spirit it's going to be okay it's going to be just fine the Holy Spirit tells you it's going to be just fine so I have this quote and as I'm going and you know there's a little creep uhh and we have to cross the creek and again with the little ones I want to make sure nobody's and so I you know you're Crossing and you're stepping making sure it's solid and I see this piece of wood brother brandom talked about it it looked solid it looked like it could carry me over the creek from the outside it looked perfectly stable but as soon as I stepped on it it crumbled because was rotten brother Bram said on the outside it looks fine on the outside it looks strong but on the inside it's rotten and what it can't do it can sit there and look good but what it can't do is bear the burden of another and God has come here for Christians that are able to Bear the burdens of one another not to just sit in church and look good but to actually have something in you that when somebody needs help you can bear their burden you can say I'll pray for you brother Brandon talked about the sister he stopped in Memphis God down that plane God brought that plane down I believe and he's walking and what you know what he's doing he's doing what every Born Again believer should do following the leading of the spirit because if it would have been up to brother brandom I can't miss my flight I got to make it somewhere you know we're busy busy busy got to make it somewhere sometimes the Holy Spirit wants you to just get still and let me lead you I'll take care of the flight I'll take care of the problems I'll do the saving I'll do the healing let me just lead you so brother brandom's walking and he comes by and he he has no idea what he's doing brother God hasn't actually told him what he's doing God just said follow but God was already working just like Rebecca on the other side the prophet himself had no clue the preacher himself may have no clue he may come from Florida has no idea what's going on in the church but when God's working on the other side and you can have one person surrender and you can have the other surrender God can do great things he walks by and there's this sister yes sir and she says good morning Parson and brother brandom just stops for a moment know how' you know and she says God told me you were coming she said I'm like that Shai notice what God told her where is my Elijah not where is a preacher she didn't just need a preacher what she needed was Elijah [Applause] and this is the same spirit that has come over our lives we didn't know we had no clue you might have been in a barroom you might have been in a denominational Church wherever you were in the world you had no clue but something came down and you started looking where is my Elijah where is my messenger where is the one that will give me what I need [Applause] brother Brandon said do you know who I am she said nope I don't but I have a connection with one who knows brother Brandon went in to pray with her and he said you pray first and when she got on her knees he said I could tell she had prayed and talked to God before he didn't walk into a house that was not surrendered to God now the the young man might have gone into the world and got it into his problems and had his diseases but here was one standing in the Gap a mother standing in the gap for her son and she was standing there saying I need my Elijah somebody to touch my son I can't do it myself but I need somebody greater than me to do it brother brandom said I could tell she'd already prayed she'd already talked to God she was no stranger to God amen amen yes my brother to God and God healed her son when when the Elijah came [Music] by I will send you Elijah Elijah won't just come of his own accord he said if it was up to me I would have been a Trapper but he said I haven't been disobedient to the heavenly vision he said I will send you Elijah to do what Falling In Love With Jesus right to turn your heart not to turn your mind not to turn your knowledge not to give you thoughts and make you smart and make you think you're smarter than somebody but I'm sending you this message to turn your heart back to the faith of God you know what Paul said yes sir if I had every gift he says if I had all knowledge right because so many just want knowledge and that's why you have so many preachers fall away because all they had was a head knowledge all they had was an idea they studied it brother brandom said it'll take more than comparing quotes to quotes scripture to scripture but he said it'll take a revelation from God and he said if revelation is beyond you look up ask God for [Applause] [Music] it he sent Elijah to turn our hearts and Paul said I could have all all in other words in other words I could explain all he said all Mysteries but he said but if I don't have love love love for one another love for those around you love for God love for his word because if you have love for the word then the knowledge might not be there but God lives in the heart God lives in the heart and he leads you and guides you into all [Music] truth so we must fall in love with Jesus it's a requirement to be sincere it's a requirement to treat as more than just a gathering but we come to worship our Lord worship Our Redeemer to water the power he's given us in this day to save us brother brandom's talking about that log yes sir he said what made it worse was that it was laying in the Stream where water is and he said how like a Christian that can sit in a church pew where water is Flowing where Rivers of Life are flowing and can sit there yet be rotten on the inside because they haven't surrendered themselves he says you get rotten twice as fast and then brother Brandon says then what is we have to overcome but he says what is overcome in the same quote he says to keep life in you to keep it in you not to just keep it in the pastor or in your favorite song leader or to keep it in your mother or your father but you need to find life and take it in you and then keep it in you not just keep it in you on a Sunday or Tuesday or Wednesday but when you go home when you're at your computer when you pull out your phone when you're amongst your friends keep life in [Applause] you brother brandom talked about in the choosing of a bride two couples he married he said one of them they were really rich people their parents really rich and they had the the nicest most expensive greatest ceremony yeah it was beautiful it seemed the parts and brother Brandon said he married them but he said a couple months later he went by and he said you know I probably shouldn't do this but he said I went by and I just sat down to hear what was going on and when he over heard they weren't in love they were arguing and why were they arguing because the wife had been flirting with another man because they'd gone to a party where they shouldn't be and she was busy dancing with another man she wasn't what God is looking for in a bride because she was just like Eve was willing to look around and dance with somebody else he said I also married another couple that's right they were poor didn't have much and so he said I asked them a few questions such as where do you have somewhere to take her can you provide living for her and here this young man says he doesn't say I can give her everything he says I'll do everything I can I will not stop trying to provide for her but then brother brandham looked at the young lady and he said sister what are you going to do when he doesn't give you healing right away what are you going to do when he doesn't answer your prayer how you want it right away what are you going to do when he says no to your prayer she looked at him and she said I'll stick right by him I'll believe him even if he said no to my prayer even if the answer takes long to come but I'll stick right by him and that's the bride you might pray and ask for the prodigal and it might take time and time and time but you'll stick right there believing [Music] [Applause] am brother Brandon said I could tell they were in love that was actual love a bride loving her [Applause] bridegroom so that means if you love him his yeses and his NOS are as good as one [Applause] [Music] another if you love him and he doesn't answer your prayer like you thought he would this is what true Holy Spirit revelation will do to a Believer they won't say well God didn't answer how I wanted it I'm leaving they'll say like Peter to whom would we go where else am I going to go he might have not given me exactly what I wanted but he saved my soul he gave me a wedding band a wedding band of Grace and he left but he said I'm coming back for you brother brandom said that rich couple all it was was a put on and he said what a shame for Christians that are just a put on what a shame for a preacher that is just a put on what a shame for believers that are just to put on hang around when things go well but when things start hitting the church brother brandham said stick closer together he said and follow your pastor because he's been ordained to lead you he's been ordained by the holy spirit to guide you through these things why because we're under headship under the leadership of the Holy Spirit where it's no longer making our own way but now it's Jesus leading us not just a preacher a pastor we're not corporate here there's not a a corporate office but Jesus leading each and every member of his bride brother brandham says the very name Ephesus has a strange compound meaning go ahead it means aimed at rela and relaxed brother brandom says the high aspirations of this age that had begun with the fullness of the spirit speaking about the Ephesian age the depth of God whereby they were aiming at the High Calling of God began to give way to a less watchful attitude right a life that began on fire for God that couldn't wait till those doors open to come to church but if they allow it Satan's the enemy of Faith he wants to come and draw you away that's it and make your love cold till that you started out you couldn't wait to come and now you might come to evening service you might not you might come to Wednesday you might not it depends on if I have to work or not if I have to make a little more money you know he says a less Ardent following of Jesus Christ began to manifest itself as an omen listen because this isn't only to the Ephesian age of an omen that in the future ages the physical vehicle called The Church would sink to the awfulness of the depths of Satan it had become relaxed and it was drifting brother bham said the Ephesian age had presented to her the opportunity for God's best you know this message is God's best brother brandham said that in the end time all of Hell poured out but he said when all of Hell poured out God opened up heaven and just let it all out that when every giant that Satan's ever used to destroy a man's life God has poured out all of Heaven to fill a bride to overcome [Applause] but the Ephesian age had presented to her the opportunity for God's best and he says and for a while she prevailed look at your life right I believe church should be introspective look at yourself don't look at your neighbor don't think about the one that didn't come think about yourself for a while you've had the opportunity for God's best right preaching at this church is God's best given to the bride in this place a foreordained place for Hungry souls to come and to receive from [Applause] Jesus for a while she prevailed but then she relaxed and I'm just going to say we've all been there we've all been there for a while we Prevail young people for a while you prevail after you go to a camp meeting and then you relax for a while after the camp you you you get up from The Altar and you say I'm going to throw away all the pornography I'm going to throw away all the worldly movies all the Fashions of the world all these things that have hindered me I'm going to throw them away and for a while you Prevail the problem is then you relax when God doesn't want you to just have a moment of baptism he wants you to have a lifetime of an in fing that a spirit will fill you to lead your life that you will no longer want those things and it's not just for the old people it's not just for the old people no no there's going to be young people that stand for this message you know if time goes on brother Steven there's going to be young men that rise up to be deacons to be ministers that can encourage the bride God doesn't want you to just be a log that's rotted on the inside he wants to use your life to help somebody to help the bride and there's going to be mothers and grandmothers Women of Faith that can be written of like in the Bible Timothy It Was Written of his grandmother and his mother and Paul said the faith that was in them I see it in you where did he get that Faith from an example of a mother Satan wants to tell our sisters that you're nothing and that you're suppressed but God wants to use you for far more than a president could want to use you for far more than a government or a job could use you for to raise Sons and Daughters of God [Applause] we need to be in love with Jesus you know the Bible says you shall love the Lord with all your heart your strength your mind all that you are brother brandom spoke about Samson he said Samson gave God his strength that's right but he didn't give God his heart that's right that's right he gave his heart to Delilah in other words he gave God his strength you know he gave God what what was powerful and what was maybe brought Fame and all these things but when it came down to actually giving God his heart he didn't give it to God he gave it instead to the world and what happened was God had put a promise over him yes sir that if you stay in your place yes sir if you stay in your god-given place if you keep God's word he said I will give you Victory there'll be no Giants no man be able to stand before you so much so that he would take a jawo and slay a whole Army one man sir sir but was his strength slaying a whole Army all that was was he gave God his strength but the whole time his heart he gave it to the world and what that did no matter how strong he was no matter how much God used him for a Time eventually his heart being in the world brought him to a place where the world stripped him of all power it stripped them of every promise it stripped them of overcoming power he could have sat in a church and not been able to overcome as the word comes forth because his heart was in the world that's right right that's right brother Brandon says but you've got to surrender soul body Spirit strength everything you are you've got to surrender your family you've got to surrender your church you've got to quit trying to save them yourself and just let God move however God wants to move you got to quit trying to beat them into coming and just give them to God because they were God's first Jesus sent this message to prepare a bride and to turn not just her strength but her heart her heart back to the faith and the bride's heart will be turned back and there are benefits that come with this right Psalms 103 says forget not all my benefits who heals all your diseases and forgives all your iniquities you know brother Bram I was listening to Invisible Union yes sir and he says when a child of God takes the spirit and the word and receives it that is when the wedding band of Grace is placed on their finger brother brandom said you're not just forgiven you are Justified he says what Justified means you can come and say brother I forgive you for doing such and such for drinking for doing this and I can look at you devil and say what are you talking about I never did it in the first place brother brandham said your first nature did it but when that nature died God put it in the sea of forgetfulness and he slipped the wedding band of unmerited Grace on you and when that wedding band comes on all God's benefits are opened up to you every single one healing forgiveness of your sins restoration of your life opened up to you but if healing was all we wanted we'd be of all men most miserable if we had hope only in this world we'd be miserable but a wedding band means something more than just healing a wedding band means you are promised connect you know Paul said to the Galatians he said that's all right brother he said Paul said to the Galatians he said you've been so quickly moved from the message that I brought what did the message do he said that espoused you the message of the Prophet took a bride and espoused her which means it promised her it married her right brother brandom said when you make that promise in God's eyes you're [Applause] married be spiritually minded when that promise is made to you and that wedding band is given to you it might be an engagement ring but when that's given to you you are promised you are his he takes upon you your upon him your burden he's responsible for you he's responsible for the bride he's responsible for your family he's responsible for your healing he's responsible for your finances he's responsible for your home for your bills he's responsible for the church [Applause] brother Brandon said and I want you to see where we are where we are because we're in a holding period because brother brandom said many we're Western right we're from the west and he says but the Bible's an Eastern book right so when we read the Bible he says we have to realize realiz they had Eastern customs and so when you start reading about marriage in Jewish culture and when this was written the way it would work is that a man would first look for a bride he'd find one and he'd pay for her and when he paid for her she had the option can say yes or no sir right Rebecca's mother and her brother said we don't know ask her and elra looked at her and said will you come now they said no no no wait don't go yet stay for a little while in denomination stay for a little while in the world stay for a little while let me convince you Rebecca looked at the message and the messenger she said I won't stay I will go I will follow and what did aler do he provided clothing for her he dressed her brother bandam said if I can get the bride to stand still I will dress her for a [Applause] wedding so the price is paid the choosing of a bride commences he chose you and now you say yes or no yes yes yes when the elected lady says yes I will go a wedding ring is provided payment is made but then she doesn't go with him right away a ceremony is done but he says all right now wait I will be back for you your promise to me you're mine I've paid for you but I'm not taking you yet he goes in the custom is he goes to prepare a place he goes to prepare a [Applause] home when she says yes she might not have gone with him yet but he is already responsible for her she is his and now what he's doing is he's going to prepare a place and then usually about 12 months later a year later he comes back and that's when he takes her to a wedding supper that's when he takes her and marries her am so you see why when you make that promise sir when you say yes you are as good as married and when Jesus sent this message and we the elected lady the elected right brother brandom says I call her misss Jesus Christ Ms Grace he says when when you receive the message and accept it and he slips that wedding band on you church he might have gone to prepare a place for us and we're sure of that but he is responsible for us right now [Applause] [Music] but there's something expected of the lady those 12 months she can't just sit there and do nothing she has to make preparation because he's already promised he's already told her what he's going to do he's already said I'm coming back for you and now she has to make ready to go she has to start cutting all ties getting ready to leave her father's house leave her mother's house leave this war behind and be willing to go with him brother brandham talked about the man from Chicago that he came and there was all this commotion here comes a message here comes a prophet and all these people came out and all the cousins came out because they thought they were better because they were dressed better maybe had a bigger Church More Money More anointing you could say but here's this little cousin who's forgotten but see she had a character in her that she was willing to serve she was willing to make preparation she was a Rebecca that watered the prophets and was willing to water his camels and when this Elijah came and he saw all the cousins glory to God he said is this all we could produce is this all preaching we've preached and we've preached and we've preached is this all that could be produced a witch he said a witch LED that American Church a witch dancing like the world dressed like the world looked like the world yet said they were Christians brother brandham said you claim to be a Christian you'll be judged as a Christian but this man looked around and that wasn't enough that's not what I'm looking for in a bride I'm not looking for a witch to be my bride I'm not looking for one that looks like the world that tries to act like the world but he noticed something there was a little cousin a little church in Gastonia that they had all written her off they had all said this church is worth nothing it's a small Church it won't last but the message came by and saw something didn't matter how small it was it's all they were Sons and Daughters of God he was looking for a bride and he found character that was like his he found character that fit with him that he said I am the same yesterday today and forever and the bride said amen he said dress like a woman dressed like a man and the bride said amen he found somebody that was willing to serve and submit and you know submitting for a wife to submit is not popular today because Satan is against the word that's right and Satan wants to make our sisters think that they are just being abused and they don't have rights you have rights you have the greatest right of all and that's that you've been given Grace and whatever right you have as an American brother brandom said you give up those rights he said a sheep gives up their rights because they want to follow I was reading a quote brother brandom talked about he said he was in the out east yes and he saw a shepherd and he said it astounded him because here comes the shepherd and there's all these sheep following him in a line but what astounded him was that he was at a Marketplace and the market places there aren't like here this isn't Publix where no animals allowed there was a Street Market Foods on the street all these things that would be oh so tempting for an animal to walk by an open market there's food everywhere you could just turn and eat but if you turn and eat you lose sight of the shepherd and brother Brandon said what was incredible about the shepherd and these sheep is that he walked all those sheep down the middle of the market and he said the Sheep looked at the shepherd the whole way didn't go to the left or to the right didn't go after the shiny thing didn't go after the big church didn't go after the the reasoning and denominational ideas didn't go after the world they just kept their eyes on the shepherd and that these sheep said my sheep hear my voice and they won't go after another that's why this church is here brother because his sheep hear his voice and they won't go after another the little girl the little cousin yes worked and worked uhh and worked uhhuh and worked and prepared and worked and made money and prepared a dress and did all these things and they laughed at her the whole time he's not really coming back but she he told me he was he's not coming you know the message you believe it's not true but he told me in my heart that it was true and that he was coming back from me and the day came he gave an exact date he said on this day I will be there and when that day came she didn't wake up she was like that sister in Memphis she knew he's coming he told me he's coming he's coming she got dressed and she sat there and she waited and waited and waited and they continued laughing at her and she waited but there's a there's a Mount Zion Showdown [Applause] brother brandham said there's a Mount Caramel Showdown where Elijah spoke the word nobody believed it God waited God waited God waited but when the time came fire came down and it Vindicated it Supernatural fire then there was the mount Transfiguration Showdown where they all said this a this is not the word this can't be the word born of fornication but when the time came God came down and Vindicated and brother Bram says there's going to be a Mount Zion Showdown where God sent a message and we've stood and we've believed and we believed and we've waited and we've waited and we've gotten ready he says but there's going to come a time where The Showdown comes and brother Brandon said Jesus will be the showdown between denomination and the word Jesus will come down and vindicate it by doing what coming back for his bride fear not little flock it is your father's good pleasure to give you the [Music] kingdom and that's where we are we're in a holding period we've received the wedding band we've received it we know he's coming back it might take a little time it might have taken longer than we thought but he is coming why because he told us he was [Applause] coming the thing for us to do in closing is fall in love with Jesus because if you fall in love with Jesus all the things of the world will fade away if you fall in love with Jesus and truly ask ask him for revelation God will show you that this message and Christ are one let's all [Applause] stand we are not like that rich couple no sir that want to just flirt with the world the bride is not like that the bride is like that humble couple lived in a box car didn't have much and yet the the husband wanted to give her everything but there was things that he couldn't give her and she was just okay with it because she loved him let's bow our heads H dear heavenly father Lord you are a good God Amen you are a faithful Savior your word is true father and you've sent this message today Lord to gather a [Music] bride and you've given us the wedding band of Grace father and now what you're asking the bride to do is to prepare to be in love with you amen and if there's anybody here that can look in their lives and realize I'm not in love how I ought to be brother brandham said it's going to take a depth of sincerity and I can look in my life and brother brandham himself would say I need to be more sincere and if a prophet was humble enough to say I need to be more sincere where should we be how should we think you know it's Grace that has saved us it's grace that brought this message by our way and it's Grace that put something in us to receive and believe it not by Merit brother Brandon said it's unmerited Grace that if you haven't been as sincere as you ought to be it's going to require why don't you look to God now he's here why don't you raise your hands to him in a declaration of faith and say Lord I haven't been as sincere as I ought to be there's things in my life that are hindering me from truly falling in love with you but I don't want to be hindered anymore father I want to love you you so loved me that you gave yourself for me now let me love you so that I'll give my all to you and God sees your hand and he sees your heart and it doesn't take a long time it takes one moment fall in love with Jesus ask him to put that love in you for him maybe you've grown cold on him like the Ephesian Church age had they were aimed at and then relaxed maybe you you've relaxed but God's looking for Christians that are aimed that have a purpose that know what their purpose is and that is to serve the Lord that if that's your desire talk to him and say Lord help me dear heavenly father Lord you see every hand thank you Jesus more than a hand father Yes Lord you see the Heart Lord and this message Lord
