okay blessed be the name of the lord how many are reading the c.o.d book and their church ages okay all right no problem blessed be the name of the lord we appreciate everybody and we don't have our visitors in this church we got family members amen so everybody this morning family member god richly bless you and good to see brother caleb's father with us this morning is mama here okay but uh caleb's family is here this morning with us amen they're not visitors part of the family so god richly bless everybody amen blessed be the name of the lord buddy john i believe you already announced the building fund thank you very much i'm just going through my list quickly brother miki had a surgery on friday and the surgery went well i met with him yesterday and i was very impressed about the way the surgeon really put up things together that was so beautiful he kind of camouflaged the wound so you got to see him and you understand i don't think he's here this morning he's probably streaming so keep him in prayer for a quick recovery but the same day he was released he's at home we sat down we talked like somebody who didn't have any problem at all and you can see a big change in his face completely his face is back to normal so we praise god for it amen blessed be the name of the lord brother chima i heard that today is your birthday so happy birthday to the trustee before i miss it i had a grace by god grace to slip into brother sean martin's meeting yesterday morning so god allowed me to be there i was there in the morning service but i could not stay till the evening i have to come back and see brother mickey and then go for one thing to the other and we had service but at least we were able to support the service day i believe some of the church members are there so they're supporting the meeting which is a good thing but overall everything went pretty good amen our house meeting will be on may the 21st remember that the address will be sent to you so if you have your question and answer put them in the box so we'll make sure we get them early man this is a person who is hard to get his schedule is very very busy we talked about it since last week and finally a door open this week so lord's willing on wednesday brother wayne lawson will be preaching for us you know when pretty good [Laughter] amen wednesday service has been so good and yummy if you have a chance to just be there you will see what the lord will do for you amen so when it's hard to get by by god's grace he will be on wednesday and ministering for us you know when i saw him on fire he remained on fire still on fire and he's still the same way that i know amen that's truly a person that went into the holiest blessed be the name of the lord so let's get our bible we could not finish last week your sanctification is deep oh my god that's not the slide unless you want me to preach this it should be 209 somebody want me to preach something i can change gear get to 209 should not be looking now if you need help you let me know that's not the layout but that's okay it should be straight 209 let me help you up because i always have the old backup roof chapter 2 always a backup here yes brother sam okay praise god so keep her in prayer amen hallelujah good but it should be on the pulpit let's see still not coming up yet there we go roof chapter 2. i don't know when we're gonna leave this chapter there is so much in it roof chapter 2 verse 10 we went over and over and things keep popping up brother greg don't know what to do with the book of ruth looks like the entire bible was locked in one book a very small book this is what the opening of the seals does it makes the bible in you if you're there you can say amen verse 10 then she fell on her face you understand this already and bow herself to the ground and say to him why have i found grace in your eyes remember she worked from the morning all the way to this time then she found boaz and boaz expressed certain things that we spoke last sunday and to her she found grace amen why have i found grace in your eyes that you should take knowledge of me seeing i am a stranger amen this is a grace extended to a stranger to one who is coming from a gentile who is not part of the commonwealth of israel amen verse 11 and boaz answered and said to her he has fully been shown me you might be seated all that you have done to your mother-in-law since the death of your husband so we're going back again to the decision and the things that she did back there amen but she is in another stage she is serving but that serving is connected to whatever was done back there remember justification make way to praise god so verse 11 and boaz answered and said to her he has fully been shown me showed me all that you have done to your mother-in-law since the death of your husband and how you have left your father and your mother and the land of your nativity just like abraham and i come to a people which you knew not before the lord recompense your water your work i hope somebody is not sleeping remember the word work the lord recompense your work and a full reward be giving you of the lord god of israel under whose wings you are come to trust so everything she did she was putting herself under the wing of god amen jump to verse 14. here roof is serving and she has been serving under the reapers you understand this language now so she was under the candlestick everybody here so boaz came and broke certain things from the law completely and changed the work of roof bo has never removed the work remember he kept the work but he changed the law everybody clear and by changing the law now roof is operating differently yet still laboring the labor will remain there amen job to verse 14. if you're there you can say a man and boy say to her at meal time you remember this now she's moving from the candlestick and she has been invited to the table of the show bread you remember that amen because both the candlestick and the table of the showbread both of these things are in the field of boas remember and we are in the holy place everybody here we are in the holy place we're dealing with the candlestick and the table of the show bread he says and boa said to her at mealtime come you here and eat off the bread and dip your morso in the vinegar you see that drink offering and she sat beside the reapers and he reached her part corn and she did eat and was so fast and left everybody clear so far let's go to jeremiah chapter 31. we started last week it should be clear now jeremiah chapter 31 if you dare you can say amen a few people bubbles still turning this thing is really really really really really loaded okay so stay awake we got to work our way up i cannot rush quickly because the majority of the trouble in the message lays under justify under sanctification this is where the problem is that legalistic spirit and it makes the message bitter because somebody doesn't know how to apply and to operate the message that's why i'm going slowly i started since roof serving roof under sanctification i'm going to go slowly with this sanctification a lot of the marriages in the message are sticking right here a lot of trouble with the children in the message sticking right here the way we brought up the children in the message is because of the mess of misunderstanding the holy place so i'm gonna take my time get the roof under sanctification then get roof on the westlake then take roof under armenianism and you're going to see the mess that you cause to your children to your husband to your wives to the people in the message until they feel like the message is a bunch of law the message is not law the message is something joyful when you come on wednesday nowadays do you feel the burden anymore do you feel like oh it's time to go to church i'm tired i don't want to go to church what makes you happy now to be in church you don't want to miss wednesday you can't even hardly wait for sunday as soon as it's sunday you want to go there if it snows you upset why are you upset before you didn't want to go to church when it's uh sunday you're like nowadays you are you reach a point you even about to leave your father jump in the car and drive yourself because they're taking too long something changed in your life you have been purged from the hotel you didn't know you didn't know service is finished nobody want to go home the people are still dancing and worshiping and something what is keeping you here who's telling you to read your bible now brother stephen brother stephen is not even there who's telling you to read your message who's doing that it's not me anymore that's how the message should be somebody start pulling before i even pray let's go to 31 before the days come you remember this last sunday says the lord that i will make a new covenant so there is an odd and there is a new with the house of israel and with the house of judah not according to the covenant are made with their father remember that covenant was written on stone amen and our heart the bible says that we had a heart like stone god cannot take the commandment and write it on the heart of stone because it's reminding him again the law you're not going to be able to fulfill it you're going to fail you have to change your heart remember last sunday and give you another heart then in the heart god can put his law then that heart will make you different then coming to church is different everybody okay now blessed be the name of the lord not according to the law that i made with their father in the day that i took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of egypt which my covenant they broke they could not keep this one amen although i was ah so god was dealing with them as a husband and life and a wife so if you're dealing with a husband and wife the law really that god was bringing in israel to was a love because it was a love between the husband everybody here and his wife oh lord help me if i can sit down with you today i hope you can catch it amen i was a husband to them say the lord but this shall be the covenant that i will make with the house of israel after those days say the lord i will put my law everybody clear in the inward part the law is not going to be in the book and you are right here that's why you have a problem god is going to take the book and make you swallow it everybody okay you remember revelation 10 the top john take the book and do whatever so now the law is no more outside of you if they ask you where is the law you say well the law is good you want to see the message of the hour [Music] you want to know how to leave the message of the hour if you don't have a book and a tape come and live with me because my life is nothing but an expression of the message of the hour you are written a bit you remember last sunday i wish the whole church was here amen i will put my law in the inward part and write them in their heart which heart a heart of stone or new heart you see now and i will be their god and they shall be mine and they shall teach no more every man his neighbor nobody have to be with you putting like a radar on you in school in a cafeteria or something nobody have to be supervising you you have the supervisor himself [Music] so you're not leaving the message to please somebody anymore now you leaving the message to please they ever present help in the time of trouble [Music] so mama is there our mom is not there i am still to leave the message oh lord have mercy and every man his brother is saying know the lord for they shall all know me from of them to the everybody say the lord for i will forgive their iniquity and i will remember their sin you see calvary there the brazen altar breaking everything let's go to ezekiel then we will pray again remember we don't have visitors in this church we got family members no visitors it's our family member welcome ezekiel chapter 11 verse 18 if you dare you can say amen and they shall come there and they shall take away all the detestable things thereof and all the abomination thereof from there everybody care and i will give them one heart and i will put a new spirit within you remember that and i will take the stony heart so when we are born we are born with stony heart no matter what you preach it preaches it goes on top of a stony heart that's why it's not working it's the law anybody care because the black dog is pulling you somewhere else and god is pulling you somewhere else it's not working hey mark here and i will take the stony heart out of their flesh and will give them a heart of flesh that's the purpose that they may walk in my statute and keep my ordinances and do them so there was a problem in doing the ordinances of god in keeping the ordinances of god because the law was written on stone the law written of stone doesn't help you do the things of god because the law magnifies sin he make the black dog really angry amen that they may walk in my statute and keep my ordinances and do them and they shall be my and i will be there you remember ruth rightly let's go to ezekiel 38 36 glory be to god at the opening of the seventh seal the bible became a new book hallelujah let's go to verse 23 and i was sanctified within sanctification my great name which was profane among the hidden which you have profaned in the midst of them and the hidden shall know that i am the lord say the lord god when i shall be sanctified in you now it's a work that is working in an individual i shall be sanctified in you before the eyes for i will take you from among the hidden like roof remember and gather you out of the country all out of all countries and will bring you into your own land then i will sprinkle water so when they bring you you're still dirty remember brother branham say it's like they pick up a glass but the glass is still dirty but the picking up of the glass is justification but you are still feel free they need to clean you up not with any kind of water remember you gotta have the water for your day with clean water not any kind of water but the water of your day or the message of your day to be precise and i will sprinkle clean water upon you verse 25 and you shall be clean so what makes you clean is the water hey but here the water sanctifiers and make you clean remember those things very important amen make you clean from what from all so when god pulls you you're still filthy remember the glass everybody care remember brother branham when god pulled you you still have adults that's why when you give your heart to god you must still love somebody in the world god gotta cut it off because you justify but you're not clean yet you still have that good sweet companion in school that is not message believer okay no problem you shall be clean from all your filthiness and from all your adults we like cleanse you a new heart also everybody okay will i give you and a new spirit we saw last sunday the first thing god gives you is a new heart the second one is water a new spirit and the third one god put the his spirit the holy ghost in the building of that many people have a new heart they thought they have the holy ghost especially in this message a bunch of them cross them and you see the snake amen just cross them the snake comes up everybody here cross them so stubborn amen and i will take away the stony heart out of your flesh and i will give you a heart of water verse 27 and i will put my spirit within you and cause you after the holy ghost comes in you this is what makes you because when the holy ghost comes it's a rest you take your hand off the wheel somebody take your life over now the message is different anybody okay i will cause you to walk in my statute and you shall keep my judgment and how are you going to do then if the holy ghost is not helping you then you back to the lord anybody okay and you shall dwell in the land that i gave to your father and you shall be mine and i will be your everybody clear so far let's go ahead and pray heavenly father lord we are approaching you again humbly this morning father thanking you for your grace for your love and your mercy and for everything you have been doing for us father we have done what every mortar that you give ability to read father can do but when he comes to interpret and to minister to your children he only take lord father a work of the holy spirit lord i'm a human being i am not the holy spirit the holy spirit is in you for is you lord may you come down and may you minister to your children may you move me completely out of the way lord may you seal every demonic spirit that is contrary to your word away from this place every spirit that will make the people slumber and sleep lord father every resentment spirit will rebuke them back to hell in the name of jesus christ may you bless your children and those that are streaming we commit them unto the hand be the alpha and the omega of this service lord and give a revelation to your children in the name of jesus christ amen god bless you as you already been seated we are on part 14 of the four phases of roof i'm calling this roof in holiness last sunday we were in sanctification if i call last sunday sanctification part one and this part two we don't want to have confusion but holiness is another name for sanctification so when you say holiness or sanctification it's still the same thing everybody here but i made it so you can separate the two and be able to have it clear as in reference everybody clear if you notice here roof is not following any man roof is following maiden at the beginning she was following the reapers which were men young men but when boaz came boaz changed the order and boaz told roof not to follow men anymore but to be among the women we're going to climb everybody okay so far on our journey in the tabernacle we found out the roof moving into the tabernacle and we're moving all the way to the holy of holiest now we are in roof in a holy place and we position roof over there and roof in the holy place brother branham say it means roof serving or roof under sanctification or roof under luther and the deviation from a roof on the westlake and the deviation from westlake is roof under armenianism everybody clears so far my friend in the computer stay pretty tight you there praise be the name of the lord as we continue our journey we found out that when roof enter into the tabernacle roof have to do six interactions with the tabernacle furnitures everybody okay the first one as she enters she meets the brazen altar where she give her life she make a decision and then from there she moved to the water baptism in the level where she get baptized and the water baptism sent her completely to the candlestick where she found the messenger of her day and the messenger of the day is a light that is giving light at the absence of the sun so when he gave light he project roof not to themself but he project roof all the way to the table of the show bread and the table of the show bread down deal with the drink offering and from there roof is moving to the altar of the ancestors and from the altar of the incense we're going into the holy place where is the ark of the covenant and the throne of god in between the caribbean which is the mercy seat everybody cares so far so number one the brazen altar then you move to the lever then to the golden candlestick then to the table of the showbread then to the golden altar or the altar of incense and from there to the ark of the covenant now we are not in the holiest place yet we already dealt with the other court we already we are in the holy place so it behooves to remove the arc of the covenant and to go and still continue to deal with this everybody okay so far did i lose somebody put your seat belt because i'm taking off pretty quick everybody okay so far now as we start dealing with this we found out that when you enter into the tabernacle the first thing that you found out is the present altar anybody okay and that president until we found out that he meant the cross to us we already went to the mystery of the bridge and altar anybody care because when roof left the home edward here she went by the law you remember last sunday roof entered the field of boars everybody here through the law everybody here because the law provided food for the widows and those that were poor ever the bible says that if you are ripping your field and if some of the food are dropping down you cannot clean them you must leave them for the poor and for the widows everybody so roof enter the field of boaz which is a type of crust roof entered the field of christ by the law but here but when she entered this field she entered the field the bible says in the morning you remember and she worked all the way to midday but from the morning to the midday boaz was not there yet so roof operated under the law of moses everybody here but it was the law that brought her into the field of powers [Music] everybody okay so far it was the law of moses that brought roof to meet powers [Music] because of following the law she found herself in the field of boaz she worked under the law first then a midday boys came in amen what are you trying to say brother stephen paul says this brother kelly but before faith came [Music] can i help you again before powers came everybody here before boroughs came we were kept under the water roof was working by the law everybody okay so far we were kept under the law we were water we were like prisoner like slave that's why when roof was operating she was really in fear somebody can slap her because she's a stranger what are you doing in israel what are you doing here you're not even even even in israel get out there i'm sorry sir i'm sorry i'm just want to get some food you strange women look at you why you didn't stay in your country you hulk you denominational crop [Applause] [Music] that's what message believer do to people [Applause] you denominational crow and then roof goes like this i'm sorry i'm sorry because she was operating under the law until boasts come everybody here so we were shut up in the law because faith was not there boaz is not there yet so you can misuse me you can abuse me you can do everything you want to do to me because boaz is not there but wait till boar has come [Music] everybody okay so far we were kept under the law brother robert this anointing is juicy i don't know what time we're gonna get out when we were kept under the law we were shut up onto the water which should water be water roof never seen boys before she didn't know the face of boaz she didn't have the picture of boaz boaz must be revealed to her first everybody okay so far wherefore the lord was a water was a school master to bring us unto him he was the law of moses that brought roof to meet powers the law was important because because of the law the lord took roof to the field and made a way so that roof can meet boards so the law was a school master to bring me to my borders which is jesus christ everybody okay so far the bible says wherefore the law was a school master to bring us unto christ that we might be water by water justification is not only what luther preached because when luther preached justification loot to have a loose end because remember when the children were eating bread usually when a child eat food what happened to the other food they drop into the floor so when luther preached there was certain food that would drop when wesley preached there were certain foods that were dropped when the pentecostal came they were seated and full our job even when poor preacher [Music] because the bible said paul said i preached in part prop didn't preach everything there were certain mysteries there were certain truths there were certain scriptures that escaped paul but until malachi 4 came because malachi 4 his message is not specific he pick up the loose end the loose end of power the loose end of arenas the loose end of columba the loose end of luta the loose end of wesley and he put them all together [Music] my god blessed be the name of the lord amen so when luther preached justification all luther can say is they just live by faith you are justified go to the altar give your life to jesus christ when you stand up you are saved that's all because luther have his plateau once you reach the plateau you remember you cannot produce more if the master gives you tubes pencil you can only produce two and stop there if they give you five you cannot go beyond five you have to stop at five and go there so luther could not help himself up but there was something brother branham said it was the mysterious part of justification that was left there and when brother branham came brother branham said justification goes beyond that amen brother branham say when you are forgiven for something it means that you have done it you are guilty of it but here even though they forgive you the record is still there but under justification of malachi 4 when you are justified by the cloud the supreme judge himself it means that you never done it to begin with [Music] [Applause] in other words there is no record against you everything that was against you even god himself do not remember hallelujah he goes into the book of remembrance and wipe every record of you [Applause] what scene are you talking about what scene are you talking about are you talking about me i never seen to begin with that person that you're talking about is not me he was the devil [Applause] everybody killed so far so don't build complex in your life oh my god blessed be the name of the lord and paul say that a school master bring us unto who who jesus bore us that we might be water by water that's why when boaz met the roof he said wait a minute don't go anywhere anymore you stay here guarantee food for the rest of the life don't go to any field if you want to drink don't act like stranger go over there and go eat and i told the young man not to touch you everybody okay everybody okay but after faith is come [Music] after bo asked him and boaz broke everything from the law anybody care dead we are no longer under water my work is different now my going to church is different now everybody because paul says that christ is the end of water for water to everyone that do water everyone that is coming from the other court that believe on jesus christ christ will end the law and we found out that not only does chris end the law but he changes the law let's see first how he crashes brother branham saying we found out after this dispensation then it lasted on that illegalistic dispensation until the real royal seed came come then he took all the water upon him and paid the price of redemption and god's church is back again in water in grace back again grace again not under the law because i met boaz he's breaking every complex not under the law and legalism it's under grace and the promise of god the true seed of abraham he taken the law upon himself and the lord nailed him at the to the water of what we must do what we must not do and must do and must not do everything cross nail it at the cross because christ paul said is the end of the law so once you meet powers boards take the law and break it completely out you will continue to work but not more not anymore under the law and we found out that the law last sunday not only does the cross elba clear break the law or stop or end the law everybody care but the cross introduced another law remember last sunday which is the law of who the law of christ ever here the old law was under levitical priesthood but this law of christ is under melchizedek and melchizedek it's no longer jews and gentiles it goes with the spiritual gene of god ever here so far now paul says this he says that to them that are without the law the gentile as without the law you remember this sunday being not with the law of god in other words i cannot be without the law either i am under the levitical priesthood or i am under melchizedek you cannot be without any of them anybody here everybody care if you are hidden this law will strike you if you come in christ the christ take you away from here and put you over here so paul is saying that now me paul when i'm talking to the gentile to the hidden i am not dealing with them like somebody who doesn't have the law i have another law but that law is the law of christ what is the law of christ you ready let's go to matthew 17. if i can cross this now this is a difficult zone then we good let's go to matthew chapter five if you dare you can say amen again no visitors in this church family member everybody family member so welcome because after all in the day of the rapture we won't have no more church tabernacle tabernacle there will be only one tabernacle in heaven we all will be under malachi 4. that's it amen hallelujah matthew chapter 5. if you're there you can say amen christ came to end the law that's what paul says what has the law of christ means verse 17 if you're there you can say amen the bible says this i want you to follow me carefully keep your seat belt until i get the correct altitude you there think not this is jesus christ that i am calm to do whatever paul says i put the scripture here that christ came to end the law jesus said i didn't come to destroy the law it's paul contradicting christ we need to understand what's going on what is going on you there think not that i am come to destroy the law or the if you notice jesus doesn't say the law only because the old testament was written number one by moses moses wrote the five books of the old testament he wrote genesis leviticus number deuteronomy and exodus moses himself wrote them even though he didn't live there in some of the story so he went in the mind of god [Music] it's a prophet let me leave that alone everybody here and the rest of the book that follow you will see the majority of them are prophet ezekiel isaiah this this this and then you have the king and everything and now jesus christ summarize everything he says i didn't come to destroy the law everybody here he didn't stop at the law he said the law and remember when jesus was going to the road to emmaus everybody here when he begin to talk to them the bible said he start from who he start from moses which is the law and all the prophet you remember that how many knows that scripture i don't want you to say brother stephen's saying i want you to say the bible says and brother bran i'm saying period anybody care if you need that you let me know it's in luke 24 somewhere you're gonna find it everybody care now jesus says that think not that i come to destroy the law or the prophet i am not come to destroy but to do what to fulfill the law and the prophet everybody so the purpose of christ he came to fulfill the law and the prophet and this fulfilling here paul is calling that he made an end amen let's continue verse 18 for verily i say unto you till heaven and earth pass one jot or one teeth shall in no wise pass from the water from the lord until what all be what so jesus came to fulfill everything that's why when he died get the cross he said it is i finish everything everybody here he finish everything everybody okay what does this finishing means blessed be the name of the lord the bible says this in first john that there is no fear in love anybody okay but perfect love the water in other words love and fear cannot work together love and fear cannot work together god was dealing with israel as husband and wife either you are living in fear as husband and wife oh you are living in love as husband and wife i will get to your marriage down the road [Music] but here you can be in your marriage under luther you remember that right you remember right because under justification the marriage is still filthy [Music] a justified man a justified woman if they get in marriage it's a trouble brother branham said never let them get married it's gonna be hell because the snake is working in both ways their marriage is worthy if i get into this you're gonna get me to another road amen but love and fear cannot work together so when love come he cast out fear when powers came and entered into the field he met roof and break everything away from ruth now roof is serving no more on the fear that she is a stranger but now she belongs to the field of boaz even though she is a stranger because love christ when he comes he takes away your fear everybody okay so far my god amen he says because phil has water it's a torture when your supervisor is coming at work you were talking right as soon as you see the supervisor until one day you say i want to have my own business i'm sick and tired every time two minutes late i'm in trouble three minutes late they put a point on me oh no you did this you did three times we're gonna fire you lord can i have my own business so i can come anytime i want it why because fear goes with torment it's traveling you all the time you want to go to work singing everybody okay so far everybody okay so far so where is fear fear has torment he that fears is not made perfect in water you see a woman in marriage something is wrong my husband something is wrong something is wrong in a marriage marriage is not ruled by fear if i don't cook i'm gonna get in trouble that's not it even if i don't cook he understands me he knows that i left my wife sick at home [Applause] everybody here if i call him and i tell him that honey i could not cook because i don't feel good he's not going to start yelling at me he will say you know what don't worry i'm going to stop by zaxby and get some food and i'm going to bring it home everybody here but because i love him do you do you understand what i'm preaching because i love him even though i don't feel good let me try to cook him something not because he's gonna get mad but because of love [Music] ever here so your work is no longer under fear hey but here you still working but not under fear if you didn't cook he's not going to do anything but i don't want to abuse that one because i love him so much he loves to eat water cook so let me try to cook are you getting what i'm saying i'm trying to take the legalism off of the message everybody here that's why you heard brother branham say if i'm going i'm traveling and i turn around i told my wife if i hear you with another man it's a divorce and the woman said if i hear you also over there on facebook it's over brother branham said that's not a marriage anybody here that's not a marriage but i'm saying what it is even if i go and i can do it but when i think about my wife [Music] not we will get to that let me keep going where i am but here so he that feareth is not made perfect in water we love him why everybody here before even ruth begin to love powers when paul has already heard about rufus boaz told her that i know because wolf said why do you give me grace i'm a stranger he said no i already heard what you did to your mother i already know you i already did my investigation you're a good woman so before before even you start expressing love am i okay before you begin to have good vibration toward boys [Applause] you remember the vibration you remember before you beg because at first you were in enmity with christ but before you even be reconciled he already loves you so roof is thinking she's talking to a stranger oh this is the first time i saw the bus this is your boss yes sir i'm so sorry no when you want to do this go do this why are you doing all of this this is the first time me and you met well i say you too late i already got the whole story when you didn't even know me when i never met you when you were still unconscious of who i am and my relationship between you and me through elimelech because i am the king's man but before you even meet me i already love you why for god has sold on water love the world that he gave his only water that whosoever believed in him should not by have water but the god who is rich in water for his great weather wherewith he did what even when we were [Music] when you were smoking pipes jesus was loving you he doesn't help you up yet everybody when you were dancing in the nightclub he already loves you his love doesn't depend on what you do his love is by election before the foundation of the world i love jacob nothing you have to do you are predestined i already picked you up when the people like it or not when did the church like it or not i am the one making a decision who is going to stay on this field and who's not everybody okay christ is fulfilling the law he's fulfilling the law by love because of love ever here as he's going to cover it he's not going to cover it just to be shown he's having somebody's mind i have the book of life i have names in the book of life and i'm doing everything so that i can serve these people when i say when you were in the nightclub you don't understand me very well let me say this correctly before you were even born before your mother and your man and your father got married god already loves you the reason why your mother and your father got married is because of you [Applause] they think they got married because they love one another no he was god who saw you and god look at your formula he said to produce this i need this man and this man and put them together [Laughter] [Applause] brother branham had to be elijah the prophet and elijah must be a man of wood a man who loved wood and we must have some temper everybody here do you know what god did he went and he picked a nourishment and then he got the temper from irish you don't understand the mystery of god even your dream everything worked together for good but here he took the irish and he put it in a melting pot he said but this man doesn't like the wood elijah need to be in the wood all the time what can i do indian [Applause] he's gonna be born where in america indian from america bring the indian mother blended here so when they met together i'm gonna pull the indian forest here i take the irish here and i mix it together and i make brother branham so when brother branham is born automatically he want to go to the wood he doesn't understand why [Applause] their parents thought they loved one another maybe they showed their father or brother branham look at that woman he said no not that one look at that woman she's afraid they say know that one he was going to the bathroom he looked an indian he said wow they said this is an indian he said that's the one i like he was god who was working everything [Applause] everybody here and brother branham was born everything looked fine oh his hair looks good god look there is no bald head [Music] are you okay he took him to the barbershop brother branham was not born with a broadhead he was an accident from the barbershop the barbershop got the chemical mixed up he thought he was putting the correct chemical god changed the border do you hear me do you hear me your life is predestinated [Music] [Applause] [Music] everybody here when they put the chemical it took brother random hair only here and give him a body matching the scripture perfectly you think it's an accident it's not an accident everything work together for good whether he looks bad don't worry god knows what he's doing where am i at oh my god right here so for his great love well if he loved us even when we were dead in sin has he water with him in water by grace here water [Applause] so the fulfilling of the law was an expression of god loves towards you he loves you so much he have to fulfill the law he took your penalty and put it upon himself instead of you being killed he's saying no let me die in the place leave him alone if that is what he did what do we do to the law and the prophet you ready oh god have mercy go to uh we were on matthew 5. let's go to matthew 7. this is a hard pulling i cannot even move it is so much pulling and i'm going 25 miles an hour the road say 70. amen you there matthew 7 we're trying to understand the new law of christ then we're going to get to your sanctification because sanctification is not the way you thought if not the message will be a burden anybody here 7 verse 12 if you dare you can say amen therefore all things whatsoever you would that man should what do you even sow to you want people to love you love them you want people to give you a gift okay you also give somebody a gift what is that what does that mean let's read the scripture everything whatsoever you would that men do to you do you even sow to them for this is there and christ came to fulfill there and what but jesus is saying you missed the law i'm going slowly i gave you the law but you never understood what was the lord to you the law was good the law was the word of god everybody okay but you didn't understand the law the law have something else different but jesus says here that when you whatever you want somebody to do to you do to them do you want somebody to criticize you do you want somebody to gossip about you do you want somebody to insult you no do you want somebody to pass you without shaking your hand do you want somebody to ignore you everything that you love for people to do everybody here do also to them so everything that you see in the old testament is that that's right what are you trying to say brother stephen let me help you up more you ready go to matthew 22. now it's going to help you if you dare you can say amen matthew 22 36. matthew 22 verse 36 if you dare you can say amen everybody okay everybody okay all right master follow me carefully which is the great commandment in the water somebody came and we're going to see who was that person he said master we have the law tell me what is the biggest commandment do you know why that question because there was so many commandments that's right you must not do this you must not do this you must not do you too much he said can you tell me the biggest one in other words when i get the biggest one i can take care of this other one it's too much give me in other words can you give me the summary do you understand me can you give me the lord have so many things can you put everything together do you know what a summary means do you know what a summary means god has many names anybody okay and whenever god does something he takes and he open up a name if he provides for something he's jehovah jarrah if he heals you he's jehovah rapha if he's fighting for you he's jehovah sabawa if he stands for you he's jehovah chicano who is your justice he's job maybe jehovah which jehovah do you pray to which jehovah are you going to pray to so you're going to wake up in the morning you say jehovah jarrah i love you i do this and you stop yourself jehovah rapha how many jehovah are you going to point to but all those jehovah are only one jehovah everybody here everybody here so this one claim he said oh i love jehovah jarrah because he provided my lamb somebody else said no i love jehovah rapha when i was sick in the hospital he took me out somebody said no i love jehovah's abode he's the lord that fight for me everybody have their own jehovah what is the summary of jehovah rapha jehovah nisi jehovah chicano do you know what god did god heed his name everybody here so when jesus christ came but here ever here jesus took jehovah rapha and put in him you follow me he took jehovah messi and put in him he took jehovah chicano and putting him out the redemptive name of jesus christ of god we're all put together in jesus christ everybody okay so far so when you say jesus it is a full coverage [Applause] here everybody here you don't have to be too specific if you just say jesus when jesus come he's going to evaluate your problem ever here if he sees that he was sick he would flip himself or he morphed himself into other rafa [Music] ever hear so far if he found out that you are in trouble he's gonna immortal himself in jehovah's about in other words jesus can customize himself according to your problem [Applause] one day the mother of john the baptist had a baby [Music] and the baby was not moving everybody here they went together and mary and uh and elizabeth met together and they hugged one another so fame oh how are you doing she said it's been a long time we love you what's going on man you know what i'm pregnant you too what's going on yes my boy oh the name his name will be everybody here mary never say his name will be when a baby is dead in the womb you need to heal the baby when she spoke jesus the name that came out look at the situation and customized to the situation and brought the answer to that situation so if you are tired you don't know how to pray brief the name of jesus christ [Music] [Applause] ever here you have a child in trouble just tell that child jesus tell jesus to your husband tell jesus to your finances tell jesus to your school do your business to everything in your life ever here so the summary of the name and the title of god all of them has been summarized in one name jesus christ the father the son the holy ghost is jesus christ me and my father we are when you see me you see who [Music] ever cares so far everybody cares so far we cleared so far so they wrote many books five books the prophet isaiah ezekiel uh who uh daniel jeremiah habakka all the prophets how can i put them together give me something simple summarize everything you ready now let's go to matthew 22. oh my god you there matthew 22 36 master what is the great commandment in the law jesus said to him everybody okay everybody okay make sure you're not sleeping everybody okay you watching your bible okay you shall do what am i reading a different bible you shall love the lord your god with all your come on and we follow you come on and we follow you we're going slowly verse 38 this is the water and go in the old testament go find that [Music] commandment you know the first commandment of moses what is it here israel the lord your god is what but jesus said this is the first commandment go in the law of moses and see if the law say you shall love the god with all your heart with all your man with all this where is jesus coming up he is giving them the interpretation of the law we okay okay verse 30 uh eight this is the first and great commandment it is between you and god you follow me very good verse 39 and they thought jesus i only need the greatest but jesus is opening the second and the second is what in other words you cannot separate the first commandment or the great commandment with this one do you follow me these commandments are intertwined you cannot separate them the first is you and god ever here but the second which is like the first is what the second is like unto it you shall love your as your first body on this water hang water all the water all the law and the water in other words the entire old testament you can put it together in two commandments the love of god and the love of your neighbor that's why john said how can you love god that you don't see and you cannot love your brother that you see so everything that i gave moses you missed it it was only one commandment if you catch that commandment the law will not be a burden for you if you understand this two commandments you don't need to carry the book of the law do you get what i'm saying in other words whatever i want to do i only have to check two things is he good to god check easy good to my brother check you go you're clear if not you have to memorize everything do not commit adultery do not steal if you love your brother if you love your wife are you gonna commit adultery so instead of memorabilizing the commandment just love your wife and he will take care of adultery do you get what i'm saying you can memorize the commandment and be a legalistic or you can get the key of the commandment of the message within the commandment [Applause] [Music] brother branham say when he wrote a letter to his wife he said how are you doing the kids are sleeping i'm doing fine they can give it to you you will read oh okay this is his wife he's telling him that the kids are sleeping that's what you read when you give to brother brother uh a letter when he read and put the kids to bed the kids are sleeping he is reading something you don't get [Applause] amen oh they help me everybody here you say i miss you you miss a target maybe you miss an appointment you might miss a lot of stuff but to the one who say i miss you he knows what he's saying if you come to my office me and my assistant talk a language you don't get i'll say tooth number 14 this this this you understanding what we're saying but you don't know what i'm talking about imam means i'm going to pull your tooth in the next minute if you understand what i'm saying you'll be like no doctor not today but because you miss my the interpretation you are sitting there not knowing what we talking about ever here when i say bring a certain instrument she understand maybe the surgery is difficult and all i said how are you feeling you good yes i'm good she knows what is going on everybody okay so jesus is summarizing everything and saying this whole book that you struggle with it for so many times that it becomes a burden for you until you hate to go to church you didn't understand it was only bundled up in one thing the love of me and the love of your neighbor what are you trying to say go to mark chapter 12. lord help me mark chapter 12 if you dare you can say amen blessed be the name of the lord verse 28. you dead and one of the scrub came and having heard them reasoning together and perceived that he answered them well ask him which is the over there he was the great commander everybody okay now which is the first commandment of all and jesus answered him the first of all the commandment is he o israel the lord your god is what that one you will find and you shall love the lord your god with all your and we follow your soul and we follow your mind and we follow you this is the first commandment and the second is like namely this you shall love your neighbor as yourself there is no everybody clear there is no other commandment greater than what these two commandments are at the top and the entire law in other words every time you find the law if you look closely [Music] everybody okay did you see that so if you love somebody you're already fulfilling the law in other words you are already living the law you don't need somebody to teach you you don't need somebody you don't need to carry a big bubble like this because the bible is love everybody okay verse nine for this you shall not commit you shall not you shall not you shall not bear false witness you shall not covet if there be any other commandment it is briefly comprehended in this saying in other words any other commitment you can give me from the bible all of them means this everybody here it means what all that i have told you you shall not commit adultery you shall not steal you shall not do paul is saying all those commandments means one thing what does it mean namely this you shall love your neighbor as what because if you love your neighbor you won't steal from him everybody okay if you love your neighbor you won't commit adultery if you love your neighbor you won't comfort his stuff if you all love your neighbor you won't be a fault against your neighbor so when you just love your neighbor you're already fulfilling all the commitment everybody okay verse 10 love works no what nothing wrong to his neighbor therefore love is the fulfilling of water so everything that christ came to do here is combined in the love of god so when you look at the law and you don't see the love of god you miss god that's why brother branham said if you read the bible and you don't see jesus christ who is the love of god in every scripture you read it wrong you miss the old testament it's gonna be a bunch of commandments instead of being the love of god everybody okay so far let's go take off now my god where am i amen brother branham said to the stranger in our gate we want to welcome you back come tonight to the evening service if you are in the city and would like to drop back and be with us again tonight i'll be very happy the door is always open everybody care we have no denomination karma no water but who no law but what where did brother brother get that why did brother brother say that now you understand in other words our law is the love of christ everybody here brother branham said and no book by the water the leader tabernacle has no membership but we have water we have no creed but what no love but what so the law of christ is love that's why when boaz meet roof he crush everything i love you and because i love you you cannot behave like this everybody okay so far let's go back to ruth chapter 2 lord help me roof chapter 2 where we were we are in the field of boaz if you dare you can say amen i'm good in time it's just we taken too far in eternity it's not even one o'clock it's not one o'clock yet it's not one o'clock it's just the the the we are way with the ego so if you're worrying about time it's not one o'clock yet it's the way we are i'm dodging a story [Laughter] so relax now okay don't let the devil bother you like i'm already i'm already full i'm it's spilling over some have little stomachs um okay spiritually everybody okay let's go to roof chapter two you there job to verse 8 we are under roof in holiness we entered the field of boaz the law was a school master introduced boaz to roof and boaz break the law everybody here and change that law into the law of love roof you cannot work in my field like this i want you to be free don't go anywhere if you hungry go eat if you need something to drink go drink if you and then modify you reapers when you put the stuff make sure purposely drop certain things for her the work environment become a joy it's no longer fear everybody here because the law she christ changed the law to a new law the old testament it was fear and trembling if somebody touched the mountain they kill him if a beast touch the mountain they kill him but we'll come to another mountain man zion that's a different mountain you can touch that god and nothing happened he's not a god that is chasing you but he's a god that have his arm open to love you it's a different god amen because israel was afraid you go to the doctor don't go there you're going to get killed wrong interpretation of god normally you go to the temple to see god yes i want to see god why god this is you this is you who created heaven and earth but because of the law israel don't want even up they say moses you talk to him not us you just tell us because what we see there it's too much they misinterpret the law the lord became fearful yet god was dealing there with them as husband and wife now you wanna come to your wife and your wife is always afraid of you what kind of marriage is that you want to put your hand around her what kind of marriage is that it's a trouble everybody okay okay let's go to ruth chapter 2 verse 9. if you there you can say amen verse eight then say boys to ruth hear you not my daughter he's calling roof a daughter yet he's gonna get married to that daughter anybody here good not to glean in another field neither go from here but about here fast by the water when we talk about boars everybody okay we have a tendency to think that everything is perfect in the field of boaz anybody here when boss came roof was following after the young man ever here boys look at that order he said that's not a correct a young woman like this cannot be following men are you following me you cannot hang out with men a woman should hang out with women anybody young brother cannot hang around with young sisters do you follow me young sister must hang out with the sisters i'm fooling that from your scripture boys look at it all they say no no no no no no no no i know you are in my field but there is order you don't hang around with young man young brother hang around yourself young sister hand around yourself if you are interested in marriage then you can talk everybody here if there is no interest in merit stay away because there is danger do you follow me it was hidden right here everybody here why verse nine let's let your eyes be on the field remember the beginning i told you roof is under women you remember okay let your eyes be on the field that they do rip and go you after them not after men anymore after women because you're a woman you're a young lady i don't want you to be around man here have i not charged the young men follow me carefully that they shall not do what if the field of boars was perfect why did he have to caution the young man back here so there is danger in sanctification i'm going slowly sanctification is roof serving brother branham say that i already gave you the quote and under sanctification you are serving in the field of war but in that field sanctification carry a danger because of the law because the law magnifies sin but here and he has a tendency to bring abuse i'm going slowly it's going to help you everybody here he says i charge not the young man to touch you do you know the word touch means what to molest you so there was a potential for a reaper to molest a young woman in the legalistic setting [Music] everybody here when the church in this message is operating under legalistic he have a spirit of sexually abuse that is hidden there [Music] let me help you up again that's why you hear a pastor legalistic legalistic other women long dresses and before you know it the pastor was sleeping with a woman the pastor was sleeping with a woman the pastor was sleeping with a woman because the pastor was operating under legalistic jesus because if the pastor truly have the love of god that woman is your sister that woman is like your daughter are you gonna like to do to somebody else's daughter what you want to somebody to do to your daughter because the lord say whatever you want people to do to you do to them do you want somebody to take advantage of your daughter why do you take other daughters in the church it's covered usually under legalistic spirit because of abuse paul amen okay [Music] paul said now concerning the things whereof he wrote unto me it is good for men to water not to do water but i say do not touch a woman in other words that touch means sexually touched to be planned with you everybody in other words no young man has a right to sleep with a sister in this church [Music] can i repeat it again you who are missing on the internet make sure you listen to this sermon no young man has a right to sleep with a sister in this church if you are not married [Applause] try to molest the child i will be the one calling the police i will put you to jail first then i will come to jail to help you up when you're already inside the jail did you hear me did you hear me paul said nevertheless to avoid water let every man have his own water and let every woman have her own water having a form of what brother killing sanctification long choices evil evil evil but here having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof because the power of the holy spirit will unveil them they don't like the power in the church they want to operate the church and the legalist but here from there from such the water for of this thought out there which do water and lead water silly women laddered with sin led away with death as water every water they learn all the mysteries but never ever to come to the water knowledge of what they missed the message they thought the message was wrong they thought the message was about your floor and before you know it the pastor take advantage of the sisters in the church i told the young men not to touch you everybody cares so far everybody cares so far jump to verse verse 15 when you there when she was risen up to green boaz commended his young man saying let her glean even among them and do what do you know that word reproach means what insult her not no preacher have a right to insult the sister she's not your daughter she's not your wife you must respect her everybody here but what do we see in the message what do we see in the message legalistic spirit have usually an abused spirit hidden behind it and you hear all kind of story this pastor did this to the woman this pastor did this to the woman this person you get to church okay take off your shoes you don't need to take off your shoes lay the message oh my god the bible says this jesus said then speak jesus to the multitude to his disciples saying describe and do you know a pharisee brother branham say he's an actor sit in moses's seat they know the coach anybody care oh therefore whatsoever they beat you observe that do what follow that but do not ye after the water what they speak is not what they do in themselves for they say and do not for they bind heavy burden and grief used to be water and lay them on men's shoulder but they themselves will not move them with water the message is heavy it's a bunch of law everybody here but all their works they do for to be water it's a show they make broad villagers and enlarge the borders of their garment war until you scrub and pharisee what for ye do what what how can you find a fault in a pharisee everything even his dresses is correct but jesus look he say you know the widows in the church that have babies [Music] out the father of those babies are the pharisees jesus am i reading a different bible he said buddha the one that divides with those houses and for practice make water give them to pray they're going to pray with brother branham you came in 1963 watch their life watch their life because they miss the purpose of the law everybody here everybody here ever here so if you burn in a message whether you are born outside of the message remember this your heart looks like that according to brother branham everybody here so when you meet bars and crushed you are still not clean yet anybody they pick you up under justification and something happened to you and brother branham says that we believe in justification by faith romans 5 1 we believe that after a person has been justified by faith he has peace with the lord jesus christ but it is possible that this same person could have what habits such as water smoking doing things that he should not do what of the water that's why the snake is there and brother branham said the snake is still there even though you give your heart to jesus christ i already gave you the quote i'm sorry ever here so we found out last sunday that this process god gave you a new heart you already know what a new heart is and back here you get in the water baptism and it shifts you to the candlestick what happened in the candlestick brother branham say there is seven golden candlestick by the holy place and it's giving water remember the candlestick project light to the table of the show brain everybody here he says the candlestick are giving light light for what that's the that's to the man who quit his drinking everybody okay we're under sanctification now who quit he's smoking who quit lying who quits telling treat his neighbor now you understand what he means good to his wife all her good to her husband the same way man or a woman the believer he has come into a place where he has quit all his what under the candlestick because the shining light on the on the show brain he said which is through the blood brother branham say this candlestick bring justice brings sanctification he sanctifies you but the way he sanctifies you he does it by the blood where is that blood that will sanctify me give me that blood so i can get clean ever here which is through the blood with sanctification he is called to a new life his work he walk in there he don't have to walk by the light out there in the other coat he's got a better light you under candlestick he's walking by the light of the seven golden water we know the messenger of your ages right which is the burning which is burning olive water the holy spirit is burning on the messenger the messenger is giving a light and that light brother branham say is a sanctification by the blood what is the blood that's sanctified you ready brother brother says this pure and not adulterated oh hallelujah living soon for the sky man think your garments which are filthy wash by the water of the water the world becomes water so your blood is not the liquid your blood now is the word of god and the word of god that is coming from the candlestick in other words the word or the message of the hour is what is going to clean you up everybody here you cannot be cleaned by the world of luther you cannot be cleaned by the message of wesley this is another day this is a broad edge you must be under specific water [Applause] hallelujah he said the world became blood and the blood bled for you and you are watching the water according to jeremiah i will clean you with water clean water everybody here those water is not the water liquid but here he said the word bleeding the life of god in the word and the word was bled for you that you might be water from the water of this water the church ages the churches amen and be clean and sanctified by the washing of the water of the water and make your mind and your heart stay on water and on his water so the candlestick when they shine they sun to the show bread which is the message of your day and as you begin to eat the message that message that word is your blood that is cleaning you up lord help me so the candlestick are directing you to the table of the showbread what happened up there brother branham said not his sanctification the second stage of it it cleans the mind because remember as you moving along here brother branham say your snake is there and your habit is still hanging around but here you go with it you come there but somebody gotta deal with this you cannot get in the holiest like this because sanctification means to clean you and to set you aside for service so god can fill you with the spirit everybody here brother bottom say decrease the man set the heart the mind of the heart in order of holiness a man can repent of sin and he's still thinking maybe an immoral man every moral looking woman he found is still there maybe he's a drunkard every time he smell the drink it's still there but when he gets sanctified that cleans the water the desire out of him he takes the want outfit away he can still be tempted but it takes the want of it away still he's not right yet justification you are saved but you're not right yet sanctification it cleans the desire out but you still not right until you receive the holy ghost everybody here and brother branham is saying that when you are justified you can still smell whiskey and be tempted amen so just so so sanctification will come to remove that desire away so now even if you smell whiskey it doesn't tempt you but the snake is still there what is going on hallelujah you remember that the table of the showbread this bread were mixed with frankincense you remember that we already went through that brother branham say so his life was anointed with frankincense which means to jehovah's water and we found out according to the message that frankie says means service and the bread that was in the table of the show bread was a bread that must be sprinkled with sanchez in other words it's a word it's a word that puts you in service it's a word that requires you to do some work you must serve because boaz never took away the work he only took the law away from the work everybody okay so far what are you talking about brother branham climb up and i'm gonna go to the airport he said the next thing she has to do she had to work this is roof she already got justified she become uh do you see why i have to break that legalistic brother bradham said roof serving means roof become legalistic walk on the under legalistic or under moses you see now she had to become a legalist she had to work out her own salvation we fear and trembling like you did she went out into the field and put her clothes upon her and went out into the field and cleaned behind the water in order to get sustaining water brother branham said the work that roof was doing she became legalistic why she entered the field by the law but that law brought her to christ boaz but after boaz she continued the legalistic approach but under a different priesthood anybody okay what was she doing she was trying to find favor with boaz so she worked her way through the stage of water what is a legalistic brother branham wherefore my beloved as he have always obeyed not in my water i don't want you to be a bunch of hypocrites when i mean there everybody behave good when i'm not there everybody's back to the problem that's legalistic but here but now much more in my water so whether the messenger is there or not you're still living the word of god work out your own water with water and water everybody here for it is god which the water and you buff the water and to do his water you think you're the one doing it you think you're the one doing it it is god hang tight i'm gonna head somewhere everybody here blessed be the name of the lord brother branham say the lord believe it by faith and come into the land but the methodist thought sanctification which which was the the legalistic standpoint of it so sanctification is a legalistic stand of looter but here why because you're coming with a snake and you have habit so they gotta chop those habits away how do you chop them away not under the law of moses anybody here you got to do something i got to quit i got to let my hair grow say the women of course they don't do it no more but they didn't do it let the hair grow they had to quit wearing pants on the interface they had to wear their skate wrong short like the other they had to do something that is what she did the state of justification the state of water now yes resting was what roof under justification do you see amen roof under sanctification doing what underwater what do you mean roof laboring brother branham says this pay attention and i'm going to go to the airport because this is too much we are not too much but loaded we all claim to be the bride of christ how many believe to be the bride of christ and yet so untrue what would make this untrueness by leaving contrary to the i'm going slowly to the discipline that god has laid out for his bride to live with so this message this word this blood have discipline under the law watch out that is my own opinion the bible and it's the invaluable word of god i believe what cleans me brother stephen it's the word how does the word cleanse me yeah clean through the which i have water so the word that cleans you must be a spoken word i'm going slowly now i'm getting into your just into your sanctification ever here number two sanctify them through the that word is what so the word that is sanctifying you is the truth and the truth is jesus christ so your sanctification is crust if you need a bible scripture i'm going to show you where the bible say christ is our sanctification it's written in 1st corinthian chapter 2. everybody here husband love your wife even as christ also loved the church and gave him his uh and gave himself for it that hima and the water with the washing off the water by there that he presented to himself air not having water and water or say any such thing but it should be and without water everything that you need is in the world how do i get sanctified by that word ever here so far if brother stephen we are not under the law we under love and christ become our sanctification we under the law of christ now brother branham say that we roof under sanctification is roof under legalism what kind of legalistic is it am i back again under the law there is a different law what can the law am i operating in you ready the bible say by this we know that we love the children of god when we love and keep his water and this is the love of god that we keep his commandments and his commandments are not you cannot have a word without love he make the world heavy you follow me if i give you a commandment without seasoning that commandment with the love that commandment is grievous that's what jesus said everything i give you in the old testament it was just an expression of love all i was looking for you is to love me and to love one another if you love me and you love one another you don't even have to worry about the law you are fulfilling the law everybody here if you love me do what you don't keep the commandment because of hell there are things that you need to be aware of number one is heaven everybody here number two is hell number three is reward number four is torment or punishment everybody jesus said if you love me keep my commandment everybody the keeping of this commandment has nothing to do with heaven amen are you catching me are you catching me you are keeping the commandment not because you want to go to heaven do you follow me because if god take heaven off are you going to keep his commandment are we okay are you catching it are you catching it you're not keeping the commandment of god because you are afraid to go to hell follow me you don't do adultery because of sexually transmitted disease i don't cheat on my wife because i don't want to get aids you're a sinner if they remove eggs guess what you're going to cheat but here you don't do the commandment because you expect a reward from god but here i'm gonna do what god asked me to do because god will bless me wrong i'm going slowly i gotta cut that legalistic away from me i'm have to go to church because if i don't go to church i will miss heaven wrong i'm going to church because if i don't go to church i will be going to hell wrong amen i don't go to church because if i miss going to church god will punish me longer everybody here that's why brother branham said if i meet god do you follow me and god tells me that william marion branham you are going to hell not to heaven to hell brother branham say if that is his will i will go to hell do you follow me do you follow me but if i go to her i still love him [Applause] in other words lord so your perfect will in my life is for me to go to hell god said yes brother branham say i will tell god thank you very much because what you do to me is always perfect if you think i should go to hell i might as well go to loyal but i still love you god [Applause] imagine when nothing can separate me from the love of god where the heaven where the hell where the punishment whatever it is nothing [Music] do you follow me i'm trying to take the legalistic off of you i am not serving god because of going to heaven [Music] i am not playing an instrument here because i am i'm gonna get a reward legalistic oh if i don't go to church god will punish me so i go to church legalistic oh no no no if i don't repent i'm gonna go to hell legalistic because if they take hell off you go back again to sin because no matter what i do there is no more help how many people will leave the church if they call people today they say god heavyweights hell you have two people staying in churches everybody back again there's no more hair let's live in sin internally that's not it if you love me you do the water so when i do the commandment for god i'm doing that because he loved me first because when i remember that when i was singing yet christ already died for me when i was unlovable he already loved me before i was even born he put my mother and my father together just to save me because of that [Music] if he said take the high heel off i'm not taking the high heel off because of hell i am not taking the high heel off because i want to please my father i am not taking my high heel off because i want to go to heaven i am not taking my high heel off because i'm going to get punished i am not taking my high heel off to please brother stephen i am doing that because that's his commandment and because i love him i have to do his commandments lord help me he says he that has mine and keep his name he it is that do what and he that loves me shall be love of mine and i will love him and will manifest myself in water when you enter the legalistic stage of roof that's why boaz broke those stuff from roof so when roof is working she's working under love she's not working under commandment anymore amen amen hallelujah jesus answer and say unto him if a man he will keep my water so you keeping the word of god the message of the hour because you love god nothing to do with heaven nothing to do with health nothing to do with punishment nothing to do with prosperity you come to church god will prosper you okay that's why i'm coming to church that's why after a while if money doesn't come wrong wrong whether i'm poor whether i'm rich whether he works or not everybody care and my father we love him and we will come unto him and make our water in other words before i enter into you in the baptism of the holy ghost go to the legalistic stage you must be cleansed but when you are cleansed watch out you don't get cleansed to please anybody you don't get cleansed for heaven i'm just trying to see your love that's why boaz gave commandment new commandment to roof don't go anywhere stay here stay by the maidens all that bowlers want to see is obedience it has been five months have you seen roof in any field no have you seen roof watching anybody on youtube have you seen roof watching pentecostal preachers have you seen ruth playing on the internet have you seen roof on pornography he stopped pornography he's not doing that anymore why is he not doing that because i love him everybody here anybody here when love catches everything is falling painless you don't push a demon give me a few minutes and i'm going to stop i'm going to reach somewhere i don't want to leave you in the air okay let me get something down what is the purpose why do we have to obey his word why do we have to do his will what is the benefit you want to know the benefit yes get this and i'll let you go we have to go in holiness in third part amen therefore whosoever heareth this saying of man if you hear the word and [Music] there is a hearing of the word which brings faith because faith cometh by hearing but you don't stop a hearing because paul said you justify here but james move he say you justify by do you remember that you remember when that here you you got paul here you got james everybody here i heard it fine i want to see you doing it but when you do it not because of heaven not because of hell not because of reward not because of punishment i'm doing that because of love everybody okay so far hallelujah but what is the benefits of healing and doing and i'm gonna stop here we will pick up on next sunday on sanctification again he says whatsoever here's this saying of man and i will liken him unto a wise man which does what build somebody's house your own house upon a water so what i'm asking you to do is he have a benefit on yourself roof work but don't work anywhere stay in the field the working she's doing i thought the reapers when you see wolf give her what the lord says she can pick up but this is a new commandment me boas i'm telling you every time roof approaches purposely take something and drop it intentionally for roof anybody here so if roof would have gone with one gallon she can go home with 10 gallon i don't have time but i can show you the measurement of roof is uh if it was a food that she can eat five days how can you work one day and have a food that you can eat five days here at naomi according to the ifa i can divide it by the by the way maybe we can get that later everybody everybody so what i'm giving you roof to do you gotta do the work but there is no more fear nobody will trouble you no young man will molest you you are free you can continue to do and at the end you're the one that is gaining food for your own house everybody here at the end you're the one that is benefiting so i'm not telling you to do this just like that i always have a plan behind what i'm asking you to do so if i tell you remove the pants and know what i'm saying there is a benefit behind it if i tell you if i tell you come to church i know the reason why i'm telling you to come to church there is always a purpose behind every word i'm telling you because man shall not live by bread alone but by every what is the benefits the benefits is what you are building your own house upon what so when you are doing the commandment of god in your life number one you are building your house not in any kind of way by you putting your house in a rock and the rock is water as simple as it seems but you're shaking the devil remember you still have habits that are hanging on you but now we gotta get the habit off but you don't get them with moses because moses we say do not commit adultery they come as soon as they leave they go commit again adoption because under the law everybody here and the rain descended so god knows that you're going to go through a trial a rain is coming the rain descended and the flood and the wind blew and beat upon the house and it did work for it was funded on the water so one just listening to the word to the message and doing what brother branham tells you to do by love of god you are building your house and you are putting the house on a solid foundation because one of these days somebody will leave the message and he will shake you he will shake your foundation you don't know now hallelujah he said and everyone that heareth the saying of man and do them not i'm going i'm heading to the airport i'm just zeroing i'm working on my gps i'm gonna go straight everyone that hear with this saying of man and do them not he shall be like unto a water which will lift the house upon the water so when you're listening to brother branama and you don't do what the message are doing you're playing games because whatever is coming in the world now is deadly and you're going to find out but here that's why you see people married and crush divorced and all kind of amen and the rain descended and the flood came and the wind blew and beat up on the house and it fell and great was the fall of it anybody here you thought you were higher like this and the highest you touch you go that's the level you're going to get on the floor everybody here what is the benefit of this wherefore lay apart all what sanctification and superfluity of nothingness and receive with what do you know meekness means what with humility humble before my commandment with meekness the water god is saying receive my word with meekness not under the law i'm giving you this because of love because i know you need a fortification you're not strong i'm trying to protect you what made eve fall in the garden of eden she came out from behind the world i'm trying to fortify you ever here which is about to save your soul but be your doers of the world and not deceiving your honor watch out for if any man heareth the word and not a doer he is like unto a man be holding his natural face in a glass we know the glass is the word and he behold of himself and god this way go his way and straightway forget what manner of men he was you're a woman you woke up in the morning you need to come to church you go to the mirror you look you find out that your hair is messed up everybody okay and you turn around and you forgot what you saw in the mirror are you going to fix your hair the mirror was only trying to help you look good everybody here you can beat the mirror and break it the mirror is only showing you the imperfection so that you can fix it and look good before the people but when you go and you forget what you saw on the mirror you cannot fix anymore what you saw when you were before in other words when the word of god exposes something in your life you gotta take what he it and put it in your life by love if you don't do it sooner you're gonna forget and when you forget you forgot a weakness that god shine light on it to show you you are struggling here fix it quickly in other words when he shows you it is a grace that is coming to cut that stuff off do you follow me do you follow me if you're struggling with stealing the preacher don't know it and you come to church and the preacher begin to preach about stealing it is god telling you that i come to remove that stealing if you look at that and you take it quickly that stealing is going on but if you forget you will go back and that demon hang on more tired than before because you miss it everybody okay so far but whoso looketh in the law of what the law of love is freedom and continue daring he be not here but uh this man shall be when you do the work of god it is always accompanied with a blessing what are you trying to say and i'm gonna close you ready there is a hearing and there is a doing there is a hearing and there is a practice i'm gonna drop everybody here what am i saying brother branham say we teach it in theology but brother christianity is uh get this message and we're going home it is there those pharisees read the same bible that the apostle read but they didn't have faith to put into what their every denomination today reads the same but what i want to see is somebody that is got enough that shall step out and take the word amen that's what we need somebody to do what practice one day without faith without you is what does doesn't do you any good to have faith you say i believe that's the bible where if it's the bible it's got promises and if you believe that is the true wealth the only thing you have to do is to let your faith practice what you believe every bit of what are you saying do right it's your duty to god think right that is your duty to yourself and you got to come out and if you shall try this is where i'm stopping to practice the right thing are you following me if you shall try try try by love to practice the right thing it shall grow around you like care insha do you know what it means do you know what it means do you know what it means do you know what it means this is what it means i was born i was not a dentist anybody okay i look at people teeth all the time i didn't see anything you follow me one day they took me to dental school everybody okay i begin to sit and listen to teachers everybody here and the teacher begin to tell me about teeth teeth look like this thief is this tiffy this tiffany this thief is this anybody okay anybody okay and most of the time we all were studying for tests because what we were worrying was when is the next test if it's the day of test guess what everybody is in front of the computer we memorize everything if i come to school you ask me i will tell you the truth is this the two fish this the two you give the test a plus pass everybody okay three weeks after the test go back to school and ask the same person what was that what you say do you know what happened what happened what happened to the material why do we forget them because of lack of what everybody okay so far but one day we change our study in school now whatever we heard we're going to clinic and we do water are you with me are you with me tooth tooth when you want to pull a tooth you grab like this but here when you want to pull a tooth you do this when you want to pull a tooth you do this i do that the first time i do that the second time i do that the third time do i need to listen to the teacher anymore by putting the word in practice you are removing the word from the teacher and the word is now made flesh [Applause] [Music] everybody okay so when you are practicing the commandment of god you are actually incorporating the commandment of god in your life until your life become the commandment of god the musicians want to sing their practice they practice so much until when they sing they don't remember the practice anymore it looks like she was the one that wrote the song she was not the one that wrote the song she practiced the song so much until that person and the song became and when they sing they don't need to hold the paper anymore it's coming automatically and before you know it they begin to even add certain things that the one who wrote the song didn't put it everybody here you will hear somebody begin to play oh but if you look at the original singer didn't do it because the song is so much flesh in them and he activated even the gift in their life now the doing and the healing are blended together by the practice and brother branham said when you do that whatever was in that word cling to you and begin to take what is troubling you of your life practicing what you listening it is actually a way to take the word of god and to put it in your life unconsciously and before you know it you can practice dentistry without a book i don't know the last time i opened the book i was in school all the books are in me every con every disease you're bringing me i'm working because the book are no longer i don't need a teacher i don't need to hold my book like patient wait for me and you go up in chapter 25 it's not there chapter 25 is in me chapter 22 is in me chapter five is that all the chapters are there because of practice if you hear my word and you put them together in practice by love brother branham say what happened to you he shall grow around you like a vam and do what and when he hug you that habit take off and another word will come to the second habit in your life we will get to that next sunday let's stand christ came to end your lord not to put you lawless you still have a law but you have the law of love you're not not operating with fear you are operating under the law of love you're doing the commandment of god you're following the message of the hour not because of heaven not because of hell not because of reward not because of punishment you're doing that because of love because love is beyond everything the love of god is beyond everything once you understand that all the commandments all the law and the prophet hang into one commandment you shall love the lord when you do that you're fulfilling the law automatically and by fulfilling the law by love god is under obligation to remove whatever is troubling you without your effort and before you know it you will turn around and you begin to notice certain habits where already left you and you don't even know how they were gone you say wait a minute i used to be this way it's gone because the love of god that you're doing if god say read your bible you're reading your bible you think you're just reading your bible by reading the bible in obedience to the word of god that reading of the bible is taking off demons god said go to prayer before you know it you can't help it you become let's go to church you're ready to go but last year you had a hard time going to church who took that hard time going to church away the commandment that you just went with is taking demon away ever here everybody here a child did something wrong ready to be whooped and he's waiting trembling that daddy's gonna whoop him and daddy turn around and say don't do it again mother factor bought something for you from mcdonough what a virus have you injected into that child now he's confused how can i be rewarded if i did something wrong then trouble him so much until next time i'm not gonna do it game over because you're bringing a different input into his system he's expecting you to come by the law and give the whooping if you do that that's correct i deserve it i got a whooping because i did this next time i'm gonna wait when dad is not around that one i'm gonna do it the snake is still there amen because you are approaching it wrong let's pray heavenly father lord we thank you again father for your grace for your love and for your mercy and for everything you have been doing for us father i pray that's the spirit of revelation drop and take a hold of your children so that they can be free completely from the trap of armenianism from any legalistic standpoint because he brought confusion and he brought your children into bondage lord father you came to express to us exactly the very mind until your prophets say that under the seventh soul the back part mind of god was completely lord father unveiled to your children and now we understand the threefold purpose of you that you came to have preeminence in yourself and now all you want is preeminence in your brother and preeminence on your bread until your bread can give you the first place and can love you with all the heart with further mind with all the strength with all that is in them until your commandment is no longer burdened by the commandment further it becomes a commandment of love because those commandments will benefit us will help us build our christian faith into solid foundation and father it's connected to the blessings lord as we continue to labor in this subject father i pray that whatever the devil was troubling your children in the legalistic point until they felt like they were tight in the message and they have to do certain things just because they were in the message and that's the reason why we see people leaving the message and before you know it they're cutting their hair the dressing immorally because they missed the message they thought the message was a bunch of laws they did not understand that the message was not a bachelor the message was just trying to make them dress like a lady just respectfully dress appropriately dress and reflect the beauty of holiness and further if that message was sucked in whether they were out on in they would continue to keep that lord but further because of the devil and because of intellectual speaking and because of reasoning lord father the devil has been troubling so many homes until the people don't know what to do and they just do it by religion just because they have to do it if they don't do it they're afraid they're going to
