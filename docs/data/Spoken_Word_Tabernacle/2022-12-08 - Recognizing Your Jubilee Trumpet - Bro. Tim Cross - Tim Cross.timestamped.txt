[0:00] you go to your
[0:01] break those things that ponder over them
[0:04] we don't have time to break it down as
[0:07] it should be broke down but I want you
[0:09] to do it when you get to the motel or
[0:11] hotel or wherever you're staying or the
[0:12] home gather together and study over
[0:16] miss him by the way that he reveals
[0:19] himself for he is so great yet hides
[0:24] himself in Simplicity to make himself
[0:29] known to the least
[0:32] see don't try to get the great because
[0:35] he goes on the top of it
[0:37] but listen to the Simplicity of God and
[0:41] then you find God you know you're in the
[0:44] simple ways
[0:45] High polished worthy wisdom educated
[0:50] always misses him
[0:52] now I'm not here and I know they're
[0:56] School teachers two or three that I know
[0:57] I'm sitting in here and I'm not here to
[1:01] contradict school and education and try
[1:04] to support illiteratives I'm not here
[1:07] for that but what it is the people as
[1:11] soul
[1:12] much up on that
[1:14] until they're even in the seminaries and
[1:17] so forth they're missing the very thing
[1:20] that God has put before them
[1:25] that's why uh not against brother who
[1:29] are in denomination
[1:31] but I'm against system of denominations
[1:34] because it tries to magnify
[1:38] uh self and and and educate its
[1:41] ministers and thus such a place until if
[1:44] they don't have the proper schooling and
[1:46] education they're ousted and and they
[1:49] have to stand the psychiatrist past and
[1:51] so forth I've never think that it was
[1:53] God's will to test the minister by
[1:56] Psychiatry but the testing by the word
[2:01] God 's way of testing his man that he
[2:05] sent out to have the word preach the
[2:08] word
[2:09] now today we preach philosophy we preach
[2:13] Creed and denominationalism and so many
[2:16] things in leaving off the word because
[2:18] they say it can't be understood it can
[2:22] be understood he promised to do it now
[2:25] we're asking him to do it now we're
[2:28] going to take a few characters sure for
[2:30] a few minutes let's notice in the days
[2:33] of Noah
[2:35] knows they
[2:37] they God seen worldly wisdom so greatly
[2:41] punctuated and respected he sent a
[2:46] simple message by a simple person to
[2:49] show them his grace
[2:53] now we know that in the day of Noah
[2:58] they claim that a civilization
[3:02] for so mighty then until we have never
[3:05] reached that spot yet in our modern
[3:08] civilization
[3:10] and I believe that it will finally be
[3:13] reached because our lord said as it was
[3:15] in the days of Noah so will it be at the
[3:18] coming of the son of man and he gave
[3:20] some illustration
[3:22] and they built the Pyramid in the speaks
[3:25] of Egypt and they built gigantic things
[3:28] that we have no power today to build
[3:31] such with
[3:33] they had
[3:35] a bombing if they could embalm a body to
[3:37] make it look so natural until it still
[3:40] stays today we cannot we cannot make a
[3:43] mummy today we have the stuff to make it
[3:45] with
[3:46] they had colors that that hold so fast
[3:49] for four or five thousand years ago is

[26:36] um today because um he really showed up
[26:40] um this morning we Andrew and I we had a
[26:45] I had her devotion and while we were
[26:47] doing that
[26:49] um
[26:50] my sister called me and she says you
[26:53] know
[26:54] um I just got a note I was on the phone
[26:56] with my friend um in in England and and
[26:59] um I just got to realize that I was on I
[27:01] was using the wrong Channel I came up
[27:03] with a 360 dollar bill our phone are
[27:07] together so that's really me just really
[27:09] me and I was like oh my gosh okay
[27:13] and so we were already in a prayerful
[27:16] mode and everything and I must confess
[27:20] that um you know the first thing you're
[27:22] like
[27:22] oh I just had them take something off my
[27:25] bill before from you know something I
[27:27] didn't do and they're not gonna say that
[27:29] you know this is the last thing we're
[27:31] going to do for you so um
[27:33] you know you're thinking what kind of
[27:35] story can I give them
[27:36] and I was like no I can't lie so
[27:40] let me or how you know we can put it
[27:43] real good so I said you know Andrew
[27:45] let's just pray
[27:47] and I said let me take to the Lord and
[27:49] we just sit at large just make somebody
[27:51] come on the phone that can help us with
[27:53] this
[27:54] and lo and behold a young lady came on
[27:57] her she was so bubbly and everything and

[28:12] did what she could do and she says okay
[28:15] I can put on a long distance on it and
[28:17] whatever and she did that so instead of
[28:21] the 360 dollars if it cost us 15 dollars
[28:25] and so we want to give thanks for that
[28:29] amen and amen amen
[28:33] come on

[28:46] um so I don't know if you guys know but
[28:48] I'm an international student and I'm
[28:50] here at UNCC you know doing school and
[28:52] everything
[28:54] um
[28:56] so it's running down to the end of the
[28:58] semester and we've been having some
[29:01] struggles pain like covering the last
[29:03] bit of my tuition
[29:05] um my mom is a single mother so she's
[29:07] back home you know still supporting me
[29:09] and trying to help me up and stuff and
[29:12] I know like yesterday I found out that
[29:14] like if I don't cover the tuition for
[29:16] the rest of the semester for this
[29:17] semester all my classes from next
[29:19] semester were going to be canceled by
[29:21] tonight
[29:22] so for me it was very you know like
[29:25] worrying because if they got canceled
[29:26] then there's no guarantee I would get
[29:28] back into those classes and it would
[29:30] mess up you know my progress going
[29:31] forward because I only have like a year
[29:33] and a half left
[29:34] so this morning I explained the
[29:36] situation to my aunt and we were doing
[29:38] devotion and everything and we prayed
[29:40] about it and literally maybe like five
[29:42] ten minutes after my mom called and she
[29:44] told me that she got the money to be
[29:46] able you know to clear up that bill so
[29:48] that my classes won't be canceled so I'm
[29:52] a crybaby so I was crying all day but

[50:25] you've seen the seven Church ages they
[50:28] were hidden right there in Genesis
[50:30] scripture have layers the period of time
[50:34] that God took to make Eve to us is the
[50:37] period of time that God is taking
[50:39] through the second Adam to make the
[50:42] second Eve for the marriage of the Lamb
[50:45] that's why the marriage of the Lamb is
[50:47] always at the end not at the beginning

[50:55] book amen so we trust everybody is on

[56:37] bless you this evening amen you can be
[56:40] seated for just a moment if you'd like
[56:42] me
[56:42] I just want to say how thankful we are
[56:45] to be with you in the service again this
[56:47] evening
[56:49] and what brother Stephen said is true I
[56:52] don't know two or three weeks ago and he
[56:55] just started coming on my heart
[56:57] and I sometimes as if you evangelize you
[57:00] think you know I'd like to call this
[57:02] brother but I don't want him to think
[57:03] I'm
[57:04] trying to invite myself you know so I
[57:06] just held off but some kept telling me
[57:08] you're fixing to hear from Brother
[57:09] Stephen you're about to hear so he
[57:12] contacted me on Monday and I said I've
[57:14] been waiting for your call and so uh you
[57:18] know the Lord is wonderful
[57:20] and so yes as he was saying I think the
[57:25] last time I was here my wife wasn't able
[57:27] to come with me
[57:28] but we'd given you an update we were
[57:31] waiting on everything to be finalized
[57:33] with the adoption of our little baby
[57:34] girl so sometime a number of months ago
[57:38] the the county they had been making
[57:40] routine visits and doing things it's all
[57:43] a process and they said all right it's
[57:46] all good to go but they said it's it's a
[57:48] 90-day wait from here till the time you
[57:52] can get the papers and everything will
[57:54] be done legally
[57:55] and so it was our desire for it to to
[58:00] um to finish or to be complete before
[58:03] her birthday which fell
[58:06] um the day after Thanksgiving
[58:07] so we asked the social worker we said is
[58:10] there any way you could ask them to
[58:12] expedite it or just move it up only a
[58:14] couple days and get it uh finalized
[58:17] before she turns to on the Friday after
[58:21] Thanksgiving because the courts are
[58:23] closed on Thursday and Friday
[58:25] Thanksgiving Day and the Friday after
[58:27] and this is all it's a court proceeding
[58:29] so she said well we can ask for it but
[58:32] that's that's about all we can do you
[58:33] know so
[58:35] um they told us they said call on you
[58:39] know call the attorneys uh that were
[58:41] handling it and get updates from them so
[58:44] Monday before Thanksgiving I I called up
[58:46] to the attorney's office and I said I'd
[58:49] like to get an update on this um do you
[58:51] think it'll happen you know by Wednesday
[58:53] because I knew the courts were closed
[58:55] Thursday and Friday and the lady that
[58:57] answered the phone was real nice and
[58:58] real sweet and she said well sir I just
[59:02] I just really don't know she couldn't
[59:03] give me any
[59:04] anything definitive so I was trying to
[59:07] just in a in a kind way just press or a
[59:10] little bit I said well if we don't know
[59:12] something by tomorrow it's very unlikely
[59:14] this would happen Wednesday
[59:16] and I said you know how how will we know
[59:20] or how do you find out and she said well
[59:21] sir I'm the person that goes by the
[59:24] courthouse every morning before I come
[59:27] here to the attorney's office and she
[59:29] said I went by this morning there was
[59:30] nothing
[59:31] so she said if I don't hear something
[59:33] and there's nothing tomorrow morning she
[59:35] said
[59:37] you know it's it's probably not very
[59:39] likely but she said I really don't know
[59:42] so about two hours went by and around
[59:45] one or two I guess Monday afternoon my
[59:48] wife called me she said I just got a
[59:50] call from the attorney
[59:51] she said the clerk of court took this
[59:54] entire week off
[59:57] but she got this finalized before she
[1:00:00] left on Friday
[1:00:02] and the email came through from the time
[1:00:05] I called that attorney's office until
[1:00:07] she called my wife they got the email
[1:00:08] she said the paperwork will be at the
[1:00:10] courthouse tomorrow you can go pick it
[1:00:12] up we got our papers in hand
[1:00:15] and uh all my wife's family all 200 of
[1:00:19] them come in
[1:00:21] it felt like it was a it was a great
[1:00:24] multitude trust me
[1:00:26] we we got to host Thanksgiving this year
[1:00:28] in our new home and so they were all
[1:00:31] trickling in through the week and we had
[1:00:33] Thanksgiving on Thursday we uh had the
[1:00:37] baby's birthday party on Saturday had
[1:00:40] the dedication on Sunday it's all
[1:00:42] official we've got the paperwork to God
[1:00:45] be the glory
[1:00:46] amen
[1:00:51] amen
[1:00:52] we thank God for it I know so many of
[1:00:55] you have prayed with us have believed
[1:00:57] with us and I could take a long time
[1:01:00] telling you how for the last 22 years
[1:01:03] since we've been married we've always
[1:01:05] believed God would make us parrots and
[1:01:08] there's been dreams there's been
[1:01:11] prophecies there have been all kinds of
[1:01:13] things along the way to boost our faith
[1:01:16] and uh you've been a great part of that
[1:01:19] in the prayers and I just thank the Lord
[1:01:22] we're all one one big family as God's
[1:01:25] family and so um we thank God for that
[1:01:30] amen
[1:01:31] so
[1:01:33] it's it's it's affecting my ministering
[1:01:36] it's affecting being places on time it's
[1:01:39] affected my wife's ability to sing but
[1:01:41] it's wonderful amen you know I like
[1:01:44] Divine interruptions and I believe this
[1:01:46] was a Divine interruption in our lives
[1:01:49] so a welcome change so amen if you'd
[1:01:54] like to stand with me this evening
[1:01:56] um
[1:01:57] just it really is an honor to be here I
[1:01:59] don't say that just to be said it I feel
[1:02:01] right at home when I'm here and there's
[1:02:04] always a great pull in the word and so
[1:02:06] that's wonderful I'm going to invite you
[1:02:08] to turn in your Bibles to Saint Luke
[1:02:09] chapter 4 and I was telling brother
[1:02:12] Stephen when I came in tonight I said
[1:02:14] you know it's it's
[1:02:16] outstanding to me uh the order from the
[1:02:20] moment I walk through the door everybody
[1:02:23] knows their place their position their
[1:02:25] responsibility their duties and and they
[1:02:27] just carried it out seamlessly and I
[1:02:30] said that's wonderful to see and so you
[1:02:33] know God is a god of order
[1:02:35] and he has set the church in an order
[1:02:38] amen and when it's followed then God the
[1:02:41] holy spirit is pleased amen and so we
[1:02:44] thank the Lord for that amen and I know
[1:02:48] praise the Lord
[1:02:50] amen
[1:02:53] I I know that doesn't just happen that's
[1:02:56] not uh organized chaos or coincidence
[1:02:59] the devil tries everything to disrupt
[1:03:01] that amen but when God's spirit prevails
[1:03:05] wonderful and you know we're all just
[1:03:07] falling right into place amen so we
[1:03:10] thank the Lord for that and we'll read
[1:03:13] tonight in Saint Luke chapter 4 and just
[1:03:15] before we We Begin here we'll go and
[1:03:19] approach the author of the word in
[1:03:20] prayer
[1:03:21] ask the Lord to come and Quicken these
[1:03:24] words and just have his way in our midst
[1:03:27] this evening

[1:05:19] pray amen
[1:05:21] amen Saint Luke chapter 4 beginning at
[1:05:24] verse number 16.
[1:05:28] and he came to Nazareth where he had
[1:05:30] been brought up
[1:05:32] and as his custom was he went into the
[1:05:36] synagogue on the Sabbath day and for to
[1:05:39] read
[1:05:39] and there was delivered unto him the
[1:05:42] book of the prophet Isaiah and when he
[1:05:45] had opened the book he found the place
[1:05:48] where it was written the spirit of the
[1:05:51] Lord is upon me because he hath anointed
[1:05:55] me to preach the gospel to the poor he
[1:05:59] had sent me to heal the brokenhearted to
[1:06:02] preach deliberates to the captives and
[1:06:06] recovering of sight to the blind to set
[1:06:09] at Liberty them that are bruised to
[1:06:13] preach the acceptable year of the Lord
[1:06:17] and he closed the book and he gave it
[1:06:20] again to the minister and sat down and
[1:06:23] the eyes of all them that were in the
[1:06:25] synagogue were fastened on him may the
[1:06:29] Lord bless the reading of his word as
[1:06:31] you're seated this evening you know I I
[1:06:34] believe this scripture has
[1:06:37] an even greater meaning
[1:06:40] to us today
[1:06:42] because of the light that has been shed
[1:06:45] on this
[1:06:47] through the ministering of God's prophet
[1:06:50] and so it it you know just it seemed
[1:06:53] like maybe a week or so ago the Holy
[1:06:55] Spirit was just impressing upon my heart
[1:06:57] to go and listen to the the series of
[1:07:00] messages that were preached in 1965
[1:07:03] there on the month of February even the
[1:07:06] Sunday before the the meetings moved
[1:07:09] over into the Parkview High School there
[1:07:11] was a series of messages preached there
[1:07:14] in that high school and at the end is is
[1:07:17] marriage and divorce but that whole week
[1:07:20] um I suppose those those those uh days
[1:07:24] had been set aside the building there
[1:07:26] was reserved and so uh as I was moving
[1:07:29] through those series of sermons that
[1:07:31] God's Prophet preached I Came Upon this
[1:07:34] message and just listening to it and oh
[1:07:37] my it it makes the Bible live
[1:07:40] amen it brings what what was history or
[1:07:43] what's written here within these pages
[1:07:45] and it brings it very current amen and
[1:07:49] so you know you realize in the prophet
[1:07:50] of God begins there in that in that uh
[1:07:53] uh series there and he says you know
[1:07:55] this is right on the grounds
[1:07:57] where I went out late one night to pray
[1:08:00] as a boy burdened for my lost father and
[1:08:03] there he saw the the the the Lord Jesus
[1:08:06] appeared before him and his garments
[1:08:08] blowing in the wind and he said then
[1:08:10] right on this very spot here again he
[1:08:12] comes to preach and y'all may not know
[1:08:15] this but uh the the pastor who was the
[1:08:19] pastor before uh brother Josh Bennett
[1:08:22] who now pastors Apostolic Tabernacle
[1:08:25] that Pastor was Reverend Charles Brumley
[1:08:28] and brother Brumley was present for this
[1:08:31] series of meetings that brother Brandon
[1:08:33] preached there in Jeffersonville at the
[1:08:36] Parkview high school and he was there
[1:08:38] when brother Branham preached this day
[1:08:41] is this scripture fulfilled he was there
[1:08:44] with a relative of his brother a Nardi
[1:08:47] and so he he said he was sitting there I
[1:08:51] believe in in like the bleachers it was
[1:08:53] like a High School auditorium and he
[1:08:55] said he was sitting there and he said
[1:08:57] brother Adam would would rare his arm
[1:08:59] back and come back and say this day is
[1:09:02] this scripture fulfilled he said the the
[1:09:05] Holy Spirit would just sweep over the
[1:09:08] audience he said it was such a powerful
[1:09:10] thing to be a part of and he said he He
[1:09:13] Turned and made a comment to his uh I
[1:09:15] believe it was his cousin there brother
[1:09:17] brother Nardi he said if that man does
[1:09:20] that one more time this whole place is
[1:09:23] going to come apart or something like
[1:09:24] that and he said as soon as he made that
[1:09:26] comment that Prophet stared straight at
[1:09:29] him he said brother random stopped and
[1:09:32] just fixed his eyes right on him and he
[1:09:34] said the whole row of pews that whole
[1:09:37] roll of row of seats just began to
[1:09:39] tremble
[1:09:40] just begin to vibrate and shudder it was
[1:09:43] real friend the power of God is really
[1:09:47] men and so that experience he just he
[1:09:50] was transfixed by it and so you know
[1:09:52] when I hear those messages it's so real
[1:09:55] to me amen and I realize that's my
[1:09:59] prophet I mean that's that's that's
[1:10:01] God's Messenger to me in this hour amen
[1:10:05] and I accept it as thus saith the Lord
[1:10:07] amen it's a truth amen and so he he's
[1:10:11] bringing in that message and he's
[1:10:13] talking about how I guess only a few
[1:10:15] months earlier out in I believe it was
[1:10:17] in Phoenix he preached the message birth
[1:10:19] pains and their sister midi had given
[1:10:22] him a new Bible and the pages were stuck
[1:10:25] together and so he couldn't find the
[1:10:27] place in the scripture that he was
[1:10:29] looking for and he was getting kind of
[1:10:31] you know upset or flustered about it and
[1:10:34] he said here comes a priest and he says
[1:10:37] Be steady my son
[1:10:39] God is doing something
[1:10:42] a Catholic priest and so he hands
[1:10:45] brother Adam his Bible and the place
[1:10:47] where the battle is looking for so
[1:10:48] brother Adam then reads the text of it
[1:10:50] and goes on and preaches his message
[1:10:53] but then at the end of it that priest
[1:10:56] comes back and has another conversation
[1:10:58] and says you know we've we've either
[1:11:01] either the church has got to get out of
[1:11:04] the mess it's in or we've got to get out
[1:11:06] of the church he said brother Madam how
[1:11:09] come these preachers can't see this how
[1:11:12] come they can't see what you're
[1:11:14] preaching what the holy spirit is
[1:11:15] revealing and so before it was the
[1:11:18] priest telling brother Bradham Be steady
[1:11:20] my son Be steady my son God's fix God's
[1:11:23] doing something now brother random is
[1:11:25] calming the priests
[1:11:27] saying be still be still God is about to
[1:11:31] do something and then I believe it was a
[1:11:33] relative spoken and unknown tongue and
[1:11:36] interpreted amen and and verified or
[1:11:38] Vindicated the very conversation that
[1:11:41] was taking place there between brother
[1:11:43] Adam and that priest
[1:11:45] and so then brother random in hindsight
[1:11:47] realizes I believe he said afterwards
[1:11:50] they were going to grab something to eat
[1:11:52] with her family and sister meet he
[1:11:54] begins to say oh bill I was so nervous
[1:11:56] when you couldn't find your place in the
[1:11:58] scripture there and knowing I had given
[1:11:59] you that Bible and and how upsetting it
[1:12:01] was for her but then he said he heard
[1:12:04] the the the the the the the the angel of
[1:12:07] the lord of the spirit of the Lord spoke
[1:12:08] to him in an audible voice and quoted
[1:12:11] this very scripture
[1:12:13] recited this very scripture to him
[1:12:16] showing him that it was a repeat
[1:12:21] of exactly what had taken place in Luke
[1:12:24] chapter 4 had repeated itself right
[1:12:27] there in Phoenix Arizona and he
[1:12:30] unknowingly and a priest unknowingly had
[1:12:33] had
[1:12:34] reenacted this scene from the scripture
[1:12:37] and he goes on to say it's the same
[1:12:40] Messiah it's the same Jesus Christ amen
[1:12:43] revealing himself here now not in the
[1:12:47] first Advent but in his second coming
[1:12:50] the Jubilee trumpet is sounding again
[1:12:53] Amen to call a bride out of laodicea to
[1:12:57] call the believer out of denominational
[1:12:59] bondage amen and to set us in the
[1:13:02] Rapture order the coming of the Lord
[1:13:05] amen hallelujah some of you are
[1:13:08] rejoicing even now amen why because it
[1:13:12] is the Jubilee trumpet to the Bride of
[1:13:14] Jesus Christ
[1:13:16] amen and that's what I want to preach on
[1:13:18] tonight is recognizing your Jubilee
[1:13:21] trumpet
[1:13:22] because we realize and and I I'll tell
[1:13:26] you this it takes a prophet of God it
[1:13:28] takes a gift of God to extract this from
[1:13:32] the scriptures
[1:13:33] because I read here in a in a Scofield
[1:13:36] King James Version Bible amen uh Saint
[1:13:39] Luke 4 verses 16 through 19 and I don't
[1:13:42] see anything here referencing a jubilee
[1:13:45] trumpet
[1:13:46] but brother Bradham clearly says the
[1:13:49] acceptable year of the Lord refers to
[1:13:52] the Jubilee
[1:13:54] so that Jubilee was a law that was
[1:13:57] enacted in Israel
[1:13:59] for Israelites
[1:14:01] it was a it was something that was
[1:14:03] placed there when they reached the
[1:14:05] promised land this law was put there
[1:14:08] amen for their benefit
[1:14:11] so it was exclusive to Israelites
[1:14:14] it was exclusive to God's people and The
[1:14:18] Inheritance that God had given them in
[1:14:20] the Earth
[1:14:21] that if they were to be sown into
[1:14:23] slavery or taken into bondage or
[1:14:26] separated from their land and from their
[1:14:29] god-given rights and property amen that
[1:14:32] that would not be permanent but it was
[1:14:35] only for an uh predefined period of time
[1:14:38] at the end of which a jubilee trumpet
[1:14:41] would sound a man which was a signal for
[1:14:45] them to be restored back
[1:14:47] to what was theirs in the first place
[1:14:52] so this would show you that the Jubilee
[1:14:55] trumpet could sound but it would only
[1:14:58] have a special significance to a certain
[1:15:02] class of people
[1:15:03] [Applause]
[1:15:06] amen
[1:15:08] it had no meaning to a stranger
[1:15:10] it had no meaning to a Philistine it had
[1:15:13] no meaning to a hittite or an Amorite it
[1:15:17] had a meaning to an Israelites
[1:15:19] because it was God's law given to his
[1:15:22] people even to be able to regain what he
[1:15:27] had given them
[1:15:28] [Applause]
[1:15:31] [Music]
[1:15:33] so although the trumpet could be sounded
[1:15:36] it would only cause a certain reaction
[1:15:42] in a certain class of people
[1:15:45] who were listening for the trumpet
[1:15:48] and understood what to do when the
[1:15:52] trumpet sounded
[1:15:54] amen
[1:15:59] the acceptable year as we all know as
[1:16:03] Bible readers was the Year of Jubilee
[1:16:06] that when all slaves and prisoners as
[1:16:09] they were had been taken prison and had
[1:16:11] to give a son to pay a debt or a
[1:16:15] daughter to pay a debt and they were in
[1:16:17] bondage no matter how long they had been
[1:16:20] in bondage or how long they were
[1:16:22] supposed to stay there when the year
[1:16:25] come of the Jubilee when the Jubilee
[1:16:28] trumpet sounded every man could go free
[1:16:32] if he wanted to go free
[1:16:34] [Applause]
[1:16:36] you was no more a Slave
[1:16:40] amen
[1:16:41] so it showed amen before another person
[1:16:45] or another entity took ownership of you
[1:16:49] you was under another headship
[1:16:54] before you were sown into slavery before
[1:16:56] you gave away a child before you gave
[1:16:59] away something that was yours you were
[1:17:01] already under another law
[1:17:04] you were already under another
[1:17:06] protection
[1:17:08] that man only thought he owned you
[1:17:11] [Applause]
[1:17:13] that man only thought he was your master
[1:17:16] and it and brother Brown said it did not
[1:17:18] even matter what your Arrangement was
[1:17:22] the law of the Jubilee trumped or
[1:17:27] overrode amen it held a higher priority
[1:17:31] than whatever Arrangement you had made
[1:17:34] with the slave owner
[1:17:39] what a perfect example it is of the
[1:17:43] Gospel of Jesus Christ
[1:17:45] when it is preached the acceptable time
[1:17:48] at the time of Jubilee anybody no matter
[1:17:53] who you are what color you are what
[1:17:56] denomination you belong to how far you
[1:17:59] stooped in sin or what's wrong with you
[1:18:03] you can go free
[1:18:05] when you hear the gospel trumpet sound
[1:18:08] out you are free
[1:18:13] [Music]
[1:18:21] oh my
[1:18:22] I'm going to be sweating if I'm not
[1:18:24] careful
[1:18:27] Jesus was here
[1:18:30] entering the temple
[1:18:33] and the priest brought him the scroll
[1:18:38] the same scroll that every priest read
[1:18:43] every teacher read
[1:18:45] every religious scholar
[1:18:48] every Pharisee every sadducee amen it
[1:18:51] didn't every the Sanhedrin they all had
[1:18:54] the same letter
[1:18:56] they all had the same text
[1:19:00] but here is Jesus amen and the priest
[1:19:03] hands him the book
[1:19:06] and Jesus opened the book and he went to
[1:19:10] a specific place
[1:19:13] that pertained directly to him
[1:19:18] amen what this shows you is that the
[1:19:21] priest could give him the text
[1:19:24] but it took an anointed vessel it took
[1:19:27] the word made flesh to give the text the
[1:19:31] proper context
[1:19:33] because anybody can read the letters
[1:19:37] anybody with an education can read off
[1:19:39] the pages
[1:19:41] anybody can argue it anybody can debate
[1:19:45] it anybody can make a Creed out of it
[1:19:47] can make a Dogma out of it can make a
[1:19:50] law out of it
[1:19:52] but there's only one person that can
[1:19:54] make it live
[1:19:56] and that's the Holy Spirit
[1:19:58] [Music]
[1:19:59] God himself makes the word live
[1:20:03] and when he makes the word live it's not
[1:20:06] a differentiation it's not a contrast
[1:20:09] it's it's not a denial or a conflict
[1:20:11] [Music]
[1:20:13] but it's like a 3D image
[1:20:16] that comes out
[1:20:19] it makes the word three-dimensional if
[1:20:22] you will
[1:20:24] it takes it from what the carnal mind
[1:20:26] can comprehend
[1:20:29] and translates it into what God himself
[1:20:32] alone can live
[1:20:36] now that's the difference between a
[1:20:38] spiritual Spirit field born again
[1:20:42] Christian amen and a carnal or
[1:20:44] intellectual believer
[1:20:45] because to them it's just text
[1:20:48] it's just words on the page it's just
[1:20:50] doctrines it's just rules it's just oh
[1:20:52] you know a brother shimbo said or
[1:20:55] brother Timbo uh timbo
[1:20:57] brother shimbo said her brother Tim said
[1:20:59] or brother Branham said and it's just
[1:21:01] that man's word versus this man's word
[1:21:03] this man's idea versus this man's idea
[1:21:06] that's all it ever is to you you're
[1:21:08] missing the point
[1:21:10] but when the Holy Spirit comes in and
[1:21:13] quickens it not only to you but in you
[1:21:16] it brings it all together
[1:21:20] and it weaves you into that pattern so
[1:21:24] you are becoming the literal fulfillment
[1:21:28] of that word
[1:21:32] Hallelujah so when Jesus was reading the
[1:21:35] scriptures to him brother Kelly he
[1:21:37] wasn't just reading it like a newspaper
[1:21:40] Hallelujah he wasn't just reading in his
[1:21:43] history he wasn't reading it as a
[1:21:46] prophet's opinion
[1:21:47] he said the spirit of the Lord is upon
[1:21:51] me
[1:21:53] because he has anointed me to preach the
[1:21:56] gospel to the poor
[1:21:59] Hallelujah you know what I believe there
[1:22:02] was somebody
[1:22:03] sitting in the temple that day let's say
[1:22:06] wow
[1:22:07] wow
[1:22:09] wow I've heard this script around all my
[1:22:11] life
[1:22:12] but this is different
[1:22:15] this has power
[1:22:17] this is moving me
[1:22:19] this man is not just a teacher he's not
[1:22:22] just a lawyer he's not just arguing the
[1:22:25] word the word is living
[1:22:28] he caught their attention
[1:22:34] he hath anointed me to preach the gospel
[1:22:36] to the poor
[1:22:38] somebody said that's me
[1:22:42] that's me
[1:22:44] I couldn't buy my way here I couldn't
[1:22:47] buy my citizenship I don't have a nickel
[1:22:49] to spare I don't have anything but I fit
[1:22:54] that description
[1:22:56] he was sent to me
[1:22:59] [Applause]
[1:23:01] he had sent me to heal
[1:23:05] the Brokenhearted
[1:23:08] you know what some little poor
[1:23:10] broken-hearted sister
[1:23:13] amen
[1:23:15] Hallelujah
[1:23:17] that's me
[1:23:19] I could follow a Ministry like this
[1:23:23] [Music]
[1:23:24] Hallelujah Jesus was beginning his
[1:23:29] ministry
[1:23:30] it's the first recorded event after he
[1:23:33] comes down from the Temptation in the
[1:23:36] wilderness is to enter the temple and
[1:23:39] take the word of God and make it a lie
[1:23:44] ah he's calling to gather the elect
[1:23:49] and he's using the preaching of the word
[1:23:53] the same word brother they had had for 2
[1:23:57] 000 years
[1:23:58] he was making that word live
[1:24:01] right there in the temple
[1:24:04] Hallelujah
[1:24:05] [Applause]
[1:24:07] preach the gospel to the poor
[1:24:10] send me to heal the brokenhearted
[1:24:12] to preach Deliverance to the captives
[1:24:14] and recovering of sight to the blind
[1:24:17] to Senate Liberty them that are bruised
[1:24:20] to preach the acceptable year of the
[1:24:22] Lord
[1:24:25] I'm sure that was a mixed multitude
[1:24:30] in that Temple that day
[1:24:33] was a mixed multitude as as is the case
[1:24:35] most any time you have a gathering of
[1:24:37] people of any sight
[1:24:39] [Music]
[1:24:41] I'm sure everybody under the sound of
[1:24:44] his voice
[1:24:46] could not fall
[1:24:48] into these categories
[1:24:51] that he just missed it
[1:24:54] there was a maybe a wealthy person there
[1:24:57] who was very dignified
[1:25:00] and self-righteous
[1:25:02] and could buy off the priest
[1:25:05] could pay for whatever sacrifice they
[1:25:07] needed
[1:25:08] in other words they didn't need a
[1:25:10] messiah
[1:25:11] they didn't need a savior
[1:25:13] they didn't need Redemption they were
[1:25:16] not poor they were not brokenhearted
[1:25:18] they did they were not a captive in any
[1:25:21] way so they said who's this man talking
[1:25:23] to
[1:25:25] who who does this who does this Nazarite
[1:25:28] think he is
[1:25:31] coming into this entrance of the temple
[1:25:33] taking this place up here doesn't he
[1:25:36] know we have trained Scholars
[1:25:38] doesn't he know we have a hierarchy of
[1:25:40] priests with a blood lineage
[1:25:43] to prove they come from the aaronic
[1:25:45] priesthood
[1:25:46] who and they sit there in his mind in
[1:25:49] their minds they're resenting everything
[1:25:51] they're hearing
[1:25:55] why it wasn't to them
[1:25:59] it wasn't for them
[1:26:02] and they were not going to respond to
[1:26:06] the sounding of the Jubilee trumpet
[1:26:10] even though it was their opportunity
[1:26:14] to be freed
[1:26:16] it would not have that impact
[1:26:19] [Music]
[1:26:23] amen
[1:26:26] here is the Fulfillment
[1:26:28] the Fulfillment of those scriptures in
[1:26:31] their midst declaring himself
[1:26:35] and only a portion of them catching it
[1:26:38] the Jubilee was sounding
[1:26:41] but it doesn't have the same effect
[1:26:44] on everyone
[1:26:46] it only applies
[1:26:48] to a certain class of people
[1:26:50] here you'll hear and I quote this often
[1:26:52] I've probably quoted it here for the
[1:26:54] rest of the Book of Revelation is not
[1:26:56] meant for everybody
[1:26:58] it's for a specific it's a prophetic
[1:27:00] book
[1:27:01] and it's for prophetic class
[1:27:05] of people
[1:27:07] and I I say this you know a lot of
[1:27:10] people within the the Pentecostal
[1:27:13] denomination
[1:27:14] the charismatics even the religious
[1:27:17] World Protestant churches recognize that
[1:27:20] William Branham was a prophet
[1:27:23] but they classified him with every
[1:27:26] prophet
[1:27:28] anybody who had a gift to prophesy
[1:27:31] that's the category they put William
[1:27:33] Branham in
[1:27:35] men prophets women prophets anybody with
[1:27:39] the gift of Prophecy oh yes William
[1:27:40] Bradham was a prophet but that's not it
[1:27:45] takes a higher realization
[1:27:46] [Music]
[1:27:47] [Applause]
[1:27:48] he wasn't just a prophet
[1:27:51] he was a major prophet a scriptural
[1:27:55] Prophet a Capstone prophet
[1:27:58] coming at the end of the dispensations
[1:28:01] to book in what the first Apostle and
[1:28:05] Prophet The Apostle Paul began God sends
[1:28:08] another prophetic Ministry at the end of
[1:28:10] the Gentile dispensation to validate
[1:28:14] what the first prophet said amen and to
[1:28:18] cap it off and to prepare a bride to
[1:28:20] make her ready for the coming Christ the
[1:28:23] Messiah
[1:28:25] amen
[1:28:28] [Music]
[1:28:30] brother there's a lot of people that
[1:28:32] will even acknowledge the ministering of
[1:28:35] William Branham is the revealing of the
[1:28:37] son of man
[1:28:40] well you can read the messages and see
[1:28:43] that
[1:28:46] of us eighth grade education will tell
[1:28:49] you you could take it right out of the
[1:28:51] message and see that this ministry is a
[1:28:54] Ministry of the son of man but I'm not
[1:28:57] necessarily talking about people who can
[1:28:59] look at a prophetic Ministry and realize
[1:29:02] that's a prophetic Ministry
[1:29:04] I'm talking about a Ministry that can
[1:29:07] come under that same anointing
[1:29:13] a prophetic class of people
[1:29:16] that doesn't just bottle it all up in
[1:29:18] William Bradham But realize just like
[1:29:21] Elisha
[1:29:22] [Applause]
[1:29:23] that they could ask for even a double
[1:29:25] portion and for the same anointing to
[1:29:29] call upon the feminine designation of
[1:29:34] Elijah and the same Miracles continue on
[1:29:38] in a many membered body
[1:29:41] that's a prophetic class of people
[1:29:45] they're not just reading prophecy
[1:29:47] listening to prophecy they don't just
[1:29:49] appreciate prophecy they are carrying
[1:29:52] out
[1:29:55] they are the ongoing prophecy
[1:29:58] they are the perpetuation of what began
[1:30:02] in Malachi 4 hallelujah hallelujah they
[1:30:06] are the Revelation 10 8.
[1:30:09] that 10-7 made possible Hallelujah
[1:30:15] Hallelujah
[1:30:16] yes sir
[1:30:18] they don't just see the vision they are
[1:30:20] catching the vision and they are going
[1:30:23] on into the furtherance of the vision
[1:30:27] amen
[1:30:30] Hallelujah
[1:30:32] Hallelujah
[1:30:33] Hallelujah
[1:30:35] praise God praise God
[1:30:38] Hallelujah aren't you thankful that you
[1:30:40] recognize it why don't you thank God
[1:30:42] there was something dead on the inside
[1:30:44] of you that could say Amen
[1:30:48] amen
[1:30:50] it wasn't for the world it was for me
[1:30:53] it wasn't for the county it was for me
[1:30:56] it wasn't for the church it wasn't for
[1:31:00] the pastor it was for me
[1:31:02] I heard my Jubilee trouble
[1:31:07] Hallelujah
[1:31:08] Hallelujah
[1:31:10] brother when you hear it
[1:31:13] when you hear it
[1:31:15] and you're an Israelite
[1:31:17] and you know that's my signal that's
[1:31:21] myself
[1:31:22] that's my priest that's the call of my
[1:31:27] return to everything that I fell from or
[1:31:31] everything that was taken from me you
[1:31:34] cannot be still
[1:31:35] you cannot be silent you cannot remain
[1:31:39] immobile but it's going to put you into
[1:31:43] action
[1:31:44] you are the response
[1:31:47] your salvation is the response is the
[1:31:52] echo
[1:31:53] the echo of the Jubilee trumpet
[1:31:56] your Justified life it's the echo of the
[1:32:01] trumpet you're a Sanctified life is the
[1:32:03] echo of the trumpet your healing your
[1:32:07] deliverance your Victory the release
[1:32:11] of all those chains of bondage
[1:32:16] it's the effect
[1:32:18] of that trumpet
[1:32:20] Hallelujah
[1:32:22] Hallelujah
[1:32:24] thank you Jesus
[1:32:28] [Applause]
[1:32:30] amen
[1:32:31] and if you can't silence the trumpet
[1:32:34] you sure aren't going to silence the
[1:32:35] reaction
[1:32:37] you sure are not going to silence the
[1:32:38] echo
[1:32:40] [Applause]
[1:32:42] because there's
[1:32:44] one sounding
[1:32:46] and many resoundings
[1:32:47] [Music]
[1:32:49] many echoes
[1:32:51] many reverberations
[1:32:54] many responses
[1:32:56] amen
[1:32:57] and I know you sit under a wonderful
[1:33:00] Bible teacher here
[1:33:01] but turn with me to Second Kings chapter
[1:33:03] eight
[1:33:05] let's see if we can mine something out
[1:33:06] of the scriptures here
[1:33:08] Hallelujah
[1:33:11] that's why I'm so thankful we've heard a
[1:33:12] trumpet
[1:33:15] that to the elect
[1:33:17] is a certain sound
[1:33:20] it's not an uncertain sound
[1:33:23] it's only confusion
[1:33:25] to those who are non predestinated
[1:33:30] they hear it's all just another voice
[1:33:32] just another opinion
[1:33:34] just another whack job
[1:33:37] but to the train deer
[1:33:39] to the elected oh no that's a distinct
[1:33:43] sound
[1:33:44] that's a scriptural sound that makes all
[1:33:48] the scriptures come together in a
[1:33:52] Perfect Blend in harmony
[1:33:54] hallelujah it's not an uncertain sound
[1:33:58] not as thinking about
[1:33:59] this may not be a good illustration but
[1:34:01] I was thinking about you know if you've
[1:34:02] ever had a dog
[1:34:05] the ears of most dogs
[1:34:08] hear
[1:34:09] frequencies that the human ear doesn't
[1:34:12] really even hear
[1:34:14] and so you watch a dog and if he's lived
[1:34:16] with a household or a master for a while
[1:34:18] he'll learn all he'll learn how to
[1:34:21] discern all of these sounds
[1:34:24] like he'll hear a car drive in the
[1:34:27] driveway
[1:34:28] or he'll hear food going in his bowl
[1:34:31] you won't hear that
[1:34:33] because your ear isn't tuned to that
[1:34:37] but his ear is tuned to it because he
[1:34:40] has the ability to pick up those sound
[1:34:43] vibrations and to him it has a special
[1:34:47] meaning
[1:34:49] it can be 50 or 100 feet away but the
[1:34:52] owner will come home and he'll grab an
[1:34:54] old bag of dog food and shake it over
[1:34:56] into the bowl or the painter
[1:34:58] you know and you won't hear that sound
[1:35:00] but all of a sudden that dog will go
[1:35:03] tilt his head
[1:35:05] no matter what you're doing all of a
[1:35:07] sudden he's distracted
[1:35:10] he heard something
[1:35:12] that has a unique meaning to him
[1:35:17] you might be playing with him you might
[1:35:18] be training them you might be trying to
[1:35:20] give them a bath you might be trying to
[1:35:22] get him to teach him something and all
[1:35:24] of a sudden you start salivating
[1:35:27] what are you salivating for I heard a
[1:35:30] sound
[1:35:31] [Applause]
[1:35:32] that's my sound
[1:35:34] that means it's time for me to get fed
[1:35:37] oh it doesn't mean anything it don't
[1:35:41] mean that to the neighbor's dog it don't
[1:35:44] mean that to the dog down the street but
[1:35:46] to this dog that sound has a special
[1:35:49] meaning for him
[1:35:51] it's time for me to get fed
[1:35:54] are you catching what I'm saying friend
[1:35:56] this sound the message of the hour
[1:35:59] does it cause that reaction among Every
[1:36:02] Creature but to those to whom it was set
[1:36:06] that sounds like the marriage supper
[1:36:09] call
[1:36:10] that sounds like time to get dressed to
[1:36:14] put on the wedding garment to lay aside
[1:36:17] the weight and the sin that does so
[1:36:19] easily be set us to lay aside the
[1:36:21] distraction to turn off amen the
[1:36:24] internet and the television and the
[1:36:26] worldly music and the gossip and the
[1:36:29] negativity it's time to turn all that
[1:36:31] off because I hear another sound
[1:36:35] it's going home time for the bride
[1:36:39] Hallelujah
[1:36:41] Hallelujah
[1:36:43] [Applause]
[1:36:49] same sound
[1:36:51] can have a dual effect
[1:36:54] remember the story of man listen to a
[1:36:56] servant two men sat side by side and
[1:36:57] heard a sermon
[1:36:58] one man got outside and said oh my
[1:37:00] wasn't that wonderful
[1:37:02] called me an eagle
[1:37:04] I heard the same message but he called
[1:37:06] me a crow
[1:37:09] the same sound
[1:37:12] because they're very different
[1:37:15] hearing
[1:37:20] thank God
[1:37:23] second Kings chapter eight
[1:37:27] then spake Elisha unto the woman whose
[1:37:30] son he had restored the life saying
[1:37:31] arise
[1:37:33] and go thou to thine household and
[1:37:34] sojourn wheresoever thou can so dirty
[1:37:38] for the Lord hath called for a famine
[1:37:41] and it shall also come upon the land
[1:37:43] seven years
[1:37:45] and the woman arose and did after the
[1:37:48] saying of the man of God
[1:37:51] and she went with her household and
[1:37:53] sojourned in the land of the Philistines
[1:37:56] seven years
[1:37:59] I'm gonna let you pick this up later
[1:38:04] and it came to pass at the seven years
[1:38:07] in
[1:38:08] that the woman returned out of the land
[1:38:12] of the Philistines
[1:38:13] and she went forth to cry unto the king
[1:38:16] for her house
[1:38:19] and for her land
[1:38:22] and the King talked with gehaza the
[1:38:26] servant of the man of God
[1:38:28] saying tell me I pray thee all the great
[1:38:31] things that Elisha
[1:38:33] have done
[1:38:35] now that was the same Elijah anointing
[1:38:39] and Commission Now expressing itself
[1:38:43] through what I would call a feminine
[1:38:46] designation
[1:38:51] same Commission
[1:38:54] same anointing
[1:38:56] but now expressing itself
[1:38:59] in a feminine designation
[1:39:06] Amen to be the vindication
[1:39:09] of Elijah
[1:39:11] what he came to make possible was now
[1:39:15] being lived and expressed
[1:39:18] to fold to a fold Twice The Miracles
[1:39:22] under the same anointing and commission
[1:39:27] as a compliment as a compliment
[1:39:31] to Elijah as a compliment to Malachi 4
[1:39:36] as a compliment to Revelation 10 7. the
[1:39:40] bride's Ministry is the complement to
[1:39:46] Hallelujah we hold our sin unto you
[1:39:50] Elijah the prophet
[1:39:52] you are the benefactors
[1:39:55] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:39:59] the Capstone has been pulled off
[1:40:03] look on this and then the prophet brings
[1:40:06] the revelation of it to put you into
[1:40:09] action
[1:40:10] to put you in the motion
[1:40:11] [Applause]
[1:40:17] the windows of Heaven are open
[1:40:20] we prayed for it here it is
[1:40:25] [Applause]
[1:40:27] it came to pass as he was telling the
[1:40:31] king
[1:40:31] how that He restored a dead body to life
[1:40:35] that behold the woman whose son he had
[1:40:39] restored to life cried to the king for
[1:40:41] her house and for her land and gehaza
[1:40:44] said my Lord O King this is the woman
[1:40:49] and this is her son
[1:40:51] whom Elisha
[1:40:53] restored to life
[1:40:56] and when the king asked the woman
[1:40:59] she told him
[1:41:03] so the king appointed unto her a certain
[1:41:06] officer
[1:41:09] saying restore
[1:41:12] a Double L
[1:41:15] awe that was hurts
[1:41:18] [Applause]
[1:41:21] but but wait a minute
[1:41:26] she went away
[1:41:29] of her own choosing and on the advice of
[1:41:31] this
[1:41:33] prophet
[1:41:34] she left the land of promise to go down
[1:41:37] and sojourn with Philistines because of
[1:41:39] a famine he called
[1:41:42] yes his word to her gave her a
[1:41:46] protection against the very judgments of
[1:41:48] God that was falling upon that
[1:41:50] unbelieving King in his country
[1:41:52] so although it may have looked like she
[1:41:55] was forsaking or forfeiting she was not
[1:41:58] she was under Divine guidance
[1:42:02] through the instruction of a prophet
[1:42:04] [Music]
[1:42:09] doesn't matter
[1:42:11] that she
[1:42:14] doesn't matter
[1:42:16] that she wondered that she's straight
[1:42:18] that's immaterial the king I'm pointing
[1:42:21] unto her a certain officer saying
[1:42:23] restore all that was hers
[1:42:28] and
[1:42:29] not only the property
[1:42:31] not only not only being re-established
[1:42:34] not only reinheriting what had been hers
[1:42:37] all along
[1:42:38] not just giving her back
[1:42:42] what also no doubt had been desolate
[1:42:46] through the fat
[1:42:48] she wasn't there to farm it she wasn't
[1:42:51] there to irrigate it she wasn't there to
[1:42:53] fend off the the Predators
[1:42:56] she didn't do one thing but obey the
[1:42:59] prophet's instruction
[1:43:01] [Applause]
[1:43:06] Jubilee trumpet
[1:43:09] amen
[1:43:12] King appointed unto her a certain
[1:43:13] officer saying restore
[1:43:15] all that was hers and all the fruits of
[1:43:19] the field since the day that she left
[1:43:23] the land
[1:43:24] even until now
[1:43:29] so you know what that officer and
[1:43:31] brother Stephen I'm just going to say

[1:43:44] to every Son of God

[1:43:50] Divine promise of God he is there to
[1:43:54] ensure
[1:43:56] that God's desires are realized to that
[1:44:01] son or daughter of God
[1:44:03] and everything that she identifies
[1:44:08] as hurts
[1:44:09] [Applause]

[1:44:13] so she's going back through this
[1:44:15] territory say that's mine

[1:44:49] here to enforce and I have the full
[1:44:52] backing the full power all of the Power

[1:50:10] study the roots of it you may not like
[1:50:12] it but study the roots of it it's
[1:50:15] Hedonism it's paganism it's idolatry and
[1:50:18] it comes out of the pits of hell
[1:50:21] we've got a prophet who showed us a
[1:50:24] proper order
[1:50:25] he said sisters it's all right to wear a
[1:50:28] necklace your husband gave you it's all
[1:50:30] right to wear a wedding man
[1:50:31] he told us what was in order
[1:50:34] I don't want anybody thinking I'm the
[1:50:36] devil's slave
[1:50:39] I wanted I want it to be known
[1:50:43] the truth
[1:50:44] [Applause]
[1:50:46] it'll give you freedom
[1:50:48] if you'll hear the trumpet
[1:50:52] but in other words
[1:50:54] this board here now
[1:50:57] they could hear the Jubilee trumpet
[1:51:00] sound
[1:51:01] however many times
[1:51:03] it would sound thereafter
[1:51:05] but it lost its meaning
[1:51:08] it lost its significance
[1:51:13] because in the and the prophet of God
[1:51:15] defines it in this message he describes
[1:51:18] it if you listen to me said they've
[1:51:19] allowed someone else
[1:51:21] to interpret the word to them
[1:51:25] that's why they missed it in Luke 4.
[1:51:28] that's why they missed it in 1965.
[1:51:31] and that's why they're missing it today
[1:51:32] they're letting a Ministry they're
[1:51:36] letting a priest
[1:51:37] they're letting something interpret that
[1:51:40] word to them
[1:51:42] to strip away
[1:51:45] the significance
[1:51:47] of what it should mean
[1:51:49] to a true son and daughter of God
[1:51:51] so they continue hearing the word
[1:51:53] but now they're hearing it with an
[1:51:55] intellectual understanding
[1:51:57] with with reasoning
[1:51:59] they're hearing it through the filter of
[1:52:02] a man or a Ministry
[1:52:04] or a church or a system and it's bondage
[1:52:08] and it's death
[1:52:10] but thank God
[1:52:12] it wasn't the same
[1:52:15] man
[1:52:17] amen
[1:52:19] I've probably used this here and I'm
[1:52:21] closing but uh most of you know I I'm a
[1:52:25] musician and and I love to play music
[1:52:27] I'm not even a good singer but I love
[1:52:29] music and singing and then they there's
[1:52:32] something in the the music world
[1:52:35] that they call sympathetic resonance
[1:52:39] I don't know if y'all have heard about
[1:52:40] this
[1:52:41] but it's it's it goes like this
[1:52:45] they use a they use tuning Forks to do
[1:52:48] it
[1:52:49] and and let's just say you have a a
[1:52:52] tuning fork that's tuned to the note of
[1:52:55] C
[1:52:56] ough all right
[1:52:57] you you strike that tuning fork and if
[1:53:00] there's another tuning fork within the
[1:53:03] sound of it
[1:53:05] just wherever those sound waves can
[1:53:08] travel
[1:53:09] and it also is tuned to that same note
[1:53:13] without having to be struck
[1:53:17] without any physical contact
[1:53:20] just the sounding
[1:53:22] of the one
[1:53:24] will resonate over to the other one that
[1:53:27] is tuned to the same note and it too
[1:53:30] will begin to sound
[1:53:31] [Music]
[1:53:33] why because it's answering
[1:53:36] to what it's been tuned to
[1:53:39] with no motion with no physical
[1:53:41] interaction with no Force present no
[1:53:44] visible Force present amen why it's
[1:53:47] answering to a similar note
[1:53:49] [Music]
[1:53:51] and it doesn't have to be a tuning fork
[1:53:54] it can be a guitar string it can be a
[1:53:57] piano string it can be anything a singer
[1:54:00] can hit the note and those strings will
[1:54:02] begin to answer
[1:54:03] why because they're tuned
[1:54:06] to match it
[1:54:08] he that hath an ear
[1:54:12] he that hath An Origin
[1:54:17] in the Homeland
[1:54:20] Hallelujah
[1:54:22] he that has a receiver
[1:54:25] down on the inside that can pick up the
[1:54:28] signal from the transmitter and say Amen
[1:54:35] oh Hallelujah
[1:54:37] Hallelujah let me just give you one
[1:54:39] illustration as we close tonight
[1:54:43] and there I was in the woods and the
[1:54:46] Holy Spirit spoke to me and said what
[1:54:48] are you doing here
[1:54:50] and I said hunting squirrels and said
[1:54:53] how many would you like
[1:54:57] and I said was it five five would make a
[1:55:00] mess three however many the number was
[1:55:03] and he asked me where I wanted them and
[1:55:05] brother Adam's telling this story at the
[1:55:07] table
[1:55:08] and it's a table full of Deacons
[1:55:12] preachers
[1:55:14] religious man
[1:55:16] they're sitting there listening the
[1:55:18] story and they're in their minds
[1:55:23] oh my I think even brother zabel told
[1:55:26] his Abel praise said Lord if what our
[1:55:28] brother has prayed if our what our
[1:55:30] brother has said is the truth Lord help
[1:55:32] him to find that other squirrel in other
[1:55:34] words he needed some physical he needed
[1:55:36] some tangible evidence
[1:55:38] to tie his faith to
[1:55:41] but
[1:55:43] there was a widow woman
[1:55:47] with a woman
[1:55:49] with an earshot
[1:55:51] with an Elisha anointing
[1:55:54] that when she heard the report she was
[1:55:57] tuned to that voice
[1:56:00] to that report
[1:56:01] and she said that's nothing but the
[1:56:06] truth
[1:56:10] she echoed
[1:56:11] [Applause]
[1:56:14] what was vibrating from the lips of a
[1:56:18] prophet and the Holy Spirit echoed from
[1:56:21] heaven
[1:56:22] [Applause]
[1:56:24] give her
[1:56:26] give her
[1:56:27] whatsoever she asked for whatsoever she
[1:56:32] desires
[1:56:34] give it to her in the name of the Lord
[1:56:38] Jubilee Trump
[1:56:40] Jubilee trap
[1:56:43] salvation to her two sons
[1:56:46] she recognized her to believe and her
[1:56:51] children were saved Hallelujah she might
[1:56:54] have died of purple she might have lived
[1:56:56] in a poor home she might have not had
[1:56:58] enough money to hardly put something in
[1:57:00] the offering plate but she got eternal
[1:57:03] life
[1:57:04] she got an eternal blessing

[1:59:51] now to preach it that I said a while ago
[1:59:53] if you preach anything and it's the
[1:59:54] gospel truth then God is obligated to
[1:59:58] vindicate that
[2:00:00] that his soul let the god that wrote the
[2:00:03] word
[2:00:03] let the god that made the prophets Let
[2:00:06] The God Who is God of the word
[2:00:09] come forth prove that he is God he is
[2:00:13] still God as Elijah went up on the
[2:00:16] mountain watching Elisha went watching
[2:00:19] Elijah
[2:00:20] he said I want a double portion
[2:00:23] and the mantle that was on Elijah fell
[2:00:26] upon Elisha he walked down doubled that
[2:00:29] blanket up struck the river and said
[2:00:31] where is the god
[2:00:33] of Elijah and the same thing that
