John chapter 3 verse 1-8 The Book of John 3: 1 through 8 if you there you can say amen and you might be seated tonight verse one there was a man of the Pharisees named Nicodemus a ruler of the Jews the same came to Jesus by night and say unto him Raba we know that thou art a teacher come from God for no man can do these Miracles that that doth except God be with him Jesus answered and say unto him verily verily I say unto you except a man be born again there you go he cannot see the kingdom of God Nicodemus say unto him how can a man be born when he's old can he enter the second time into his mother's womb and be born Jesus answered verily verily I say unto thee except a man be born of water and of the spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom of God that which is born of flesh is flesh and that which is born of spirit is Spirit Marvel not that I say unto thee you must be born again the wind bloweth where he list and thou heish the son thereof but cannot tell whence he cometh and with he goeth so so is everyone that is born of the spirit Heavenly Father Heaven and Earth shall pass away but your word will stand forever father we read a portion of your word father to read it

I already feel good tonight here glory to God Amen amen hallelujah blessed be the name of the Lord my subject or the title of my sermon tonight is The Rebirth of the predestinated seed the rebirthed of the predestinated seed amen amen and I believe tonight that's the rebirth or the New Birth it's something that is very great amen amen and I also believe that predestination it's something that is also great and I also believe that a seed is also something that is glor it's also something that is great so those three great things have something to do with you the rebirth predestination and then the seed of God blessed be the name of the Lord hallelujah hallelujah thank you Jesus now let's start first with our our birth there is something about our birth and we will read it here amen amen let me read it here brother Bram say you are born in the world you come by nature and your whole being is black and SMY and damn and curse and go hell that is right this is the way we come in this world I came to this world you came to this world we came cursed we came damned we came going to hell this is the way we enter this world our first birth already condemned us but there is something tonight about the rebirth am glory to God blessed be the name of the Lord regardless of our first birth have condemned us there is something that is concerning our first birth brother Bram said that's the natural birth is more mysterious than the Virgin birth there is something that concern your natural birth that first birth even though we were condemned brother say there is a mystery that is more than the birth of our Lord Jesus Christ and what is making our New Birth mysterious it is predestination Hallelujah because among so many cells let me say it clearly in the midst of many sp there were million there were million but only one only one will RN will RN their race and then we will get there and then we will go and fertilize the egg and I'm going to tell you tonight that we are born we

sorry I'm sorry you good you be free amen amen Even in our natural birth there is something glorious despite the condemnation because you already won in the midst of so many CS in the midst of millions it was me it is you it is us that want the rest we reach the tar let me tell you tonight that you are born to win you are born to rule you are one to dominate and then you are a son of God don't let anybody tell you that you are not good you are good you are a son of God you are good to something God thought about you before the foundation of the world that's the reason why God in his love he called you he predestinated you to be a son of God because you are an attribute of God you are a son attribute of his Spirit blessed be the name of the Lord amen amen amen Amen brother Bram say but when you are born again we are born condemn say but don't you like the but of the scripture but when you are born again then the light of God Shine Down in th Soul hallelujah hallelujah the light of God will come down and remove the darkness and remove death and then change you from death unto life from a sinner from a prto a prophet that's what the new birth will produce in your life in the life of a Son of God can you say Amen tonight we are sons of God by predestination amen amen amen amen Amen brother Bram says this brother Bram says he has been 48 years amen amen that I belong to the bram's family and nobody ever asked me to come and join By Invitation no no sir amen amen he said I was born member of the family because I was born Bram and that's the same thing when you become

you it makes of you Eternal beings you can't die anymore because God cannot die hallelujah amen amen member of the Bram family by birth each one of us we are member of a family by birth let me tell

God by your birth by the New Birth by marriage by adoption we are married to trust hallelujah hallelujah that's the reason why brother after the opening of the seal he said I won't call you no more church but I call [Applause] you glory to God bride your name has been changed from a church to bride a bride of who of the Lord Jesus Christ and our adoption have placed us at the same level as the Lord Jesus Christ that's why the Bible say we are joint with [Applause] Christ Glory did you hear me well we are jointed with Christ and whatever CR has we have it can you say Amen blessed be the name of the Lord there is something there is something about marriage there is something about New Birth there is something about adoption Hallelujah one day there was a woman that came unto the Lord Jesus

pay attention but now notice something the the tune change from a son of David to Lord when the tune change she said Lord and Jesus pushed the break amen amen and she said my son is sick but notice something the Lord will give her a thunder the Lord speak say he said it's not good to take the children's p and give it to dogs it was like a shock that's why I call it a thunder it shocked her because she was predestinated SE hallelujah hallelujah because she was a predestin listen to her answer she said Lord it is true that it's not good to take the children's and give it to the dog but the dog they take Hallelujah they eat off the crumbs that falls from the master table and and the Lord Jesus Christ also receive a tunder [Applause] Hallelujah Hallelujah Jesus look he said even in isra not such a faith the bride the bride we have a faith a perfect Faith amen blessed be the name of the Lord blessed be the name of the Lord and the lord gave to her the desire of her heart and let

this in the message inspiration brother Bram say say d what are you looking about brother Bram I'm trying what are you talking about brother Bram I am trying to base your faith on a level with God allight read it again I am trying to base your faith on a level with God being Almighty and supreme and all powerful and om he has not changed his nature doesn't change my nature might change yours might change but God's nature will never change if he still the great Jehovah God that created heaven and earth and had all powers in his hand he's still the same Jehovah tonight Jehovah Hallelujah Hallelujah he is the same Jehovah tonight and let me tell you this when you are born again the nature of God come in you and you become a Son of God and when you become a Son of God you have the nature of your father am can you say Amen blessed be the name of the Lord hallelujah hallelujah the queen of the South brother Bram saying in all ages God had man and he's had his ministry in every age God is Supernatural and when God comes on the scene Supernatural takes place for he is Supernatural and his people always look for him in the Supernatural because when they become sons of God they become the nature of God hallelujah I didn't hear your amen you become the nature of God you become the nature of God amen hallelujah amen hallelujah and in that they pick up that believe in him by faith they believe that what God says is the truth no matter how contrary he may seemu we believe the word we believe the Bible we believe the message no matter what can the criticize no matter we are sons of God God predestinated us before the foundation of the world to believe this glorious message hallelujah hallelujah it is not him that will whom that run that is God that showeth Mercy Hallelujah by the grace of God blessed be the name of the Lord hallelujah hallelujah thank you Jesus Oh Thank You Lord The God Who is rich in Mercy say if you have eternal life tonight if we have eternal life it means that we always [Applause] [Music] existed because there is only one form of eternal we always exist that's the reason why we are living because we are a part of God Only God is eternal and we are a part of God you always existed you are first in the thoughts in the mind of God you are attribute of his spirit and now you are now attrib son manifested in flesh am amen that's why let me tell you this the Bible says that the whole creation is groing it's groaning waiting for what the manifestation of the sons of God and the sons of God will manifest the life of God amen amen glory to God amen amen hallelujah thank you Jesus you you don't remember you don't remember it you don't remember it because you were just an attribut in God in other word always you always existed there amen amen you were only in his thoughts even your name if he was never if he ever was in The Book of Life he was placed there before the foundation of the world God knew who you were now after a certain time you heard the gospel maybe you are going to a church you eat here and there and you went from a denomination to another but one day because you were a part of God you must be a part of his word and when you heard the word and you knew where you were coming you recognize the truth amen amen you always existed the the seed you were always there the seed was always in [Applause] [Music] you listen carefully the word the word saw the word that was in [Applause] you hallelujah hallelujah the word saw the word that was in you that was existing before the foundation of the word he saw the word and you came to the word the word saw the word it's like brother says of a story of eag [Music] himself in a Bard he was an old bird among his brother no bird if you ever seen the chick they always go and then scratch the Earth and back and forth but for him that kind of diet didn't work he could never go amen amen blessed be the name of the Lord because he was an eag to begin with and then mother hen want to make him or turn him into an into a CH but he was not his nature he was born different he had a different nature blessed be the name of the Lord but one day one day Mama e mama mama eag was flying over The Bard and when she was flying over she saw an eag and she s a shout the word saw the word hallelu hallelujah eag she said the eagle s shout and there was something in that that receive a [Music] Shar Mama's go that is these are fanaticism come out hallelujah hallelujah but let me tell you something he was a he was a shout of identification he was a message of identification and the message of it's a message of the identific you must be predestinated to believe this message if you're not predestinated you going to hear it but it won't make you anything but D she he heard of Mama ego and because they have the same nature the ego could identify we came to the hour we are the hour identification blessed be the name of the Lord hallelujah hallelujah we are in the evening time where the seeds must be manifested the word saw the word am amen I'm going to finish soon Hallelujah hallu PR brother Bram said the first birth to make us active here put us as mortal because of the sin that happened in Eden that made that man should be born from a woman and a man born of a woman his life is short but a man born for chist is eternal a man born of God man born of the word hallu hallelujah he is eternal if you born from a woman short days amen and then full of trouble but if you born of God when you born from a man Christ Jesus then you become Eternal etal as God is eternal amen amen job say man born of a woman his life is short full of trouble but not but a man born of Christ must be born from heaven now a man born of this Earth he become wise maybe he can be more than his P of I mean intelligence but a man born of but a man born of the word that's why we must be born again brother Bram says that's the new birth is the first
