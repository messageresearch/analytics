[32:52] boaz is working even though he's not
[32:54] present he's working through the reapers
[32:57] through the preachers
[32:58] amen
[33:00] and then roof also is working
[33:02] so when roof is working boaz is working
[33:06] so roof is picking up food and boas is
[33:08] adding up food so when roof goes back
[33:11] home there is
[33:15] there is two category of food
[33:18] there is a food that she picked up her
[33:20] own
[33:21] by the law
[33:23] everybody okay because the law told her
[33:25] to do that and there is another food
[33:27] that she has not by the law but by
[33:29] bowers
[33:31] both of them make one food
[33:33] it's hard to separate the two
[33:36] everybody okay
[33:38] don't worry i know how to warm your
[33:40] engine and crank it
[33:43] everybody care
[33:44] amen so there is two food here
[33:48] one from roof
[33:50] coming from the law or from the
[33:52] commandments of god
[33:55] makes sense now and the second rule and
[33:57] the second food is coming from water
[34:00] from boaz
[34:01] this is an expression of his love
[34:06] towards her or his intention anybody
[34:08] care
[34:10] verse 16 and let fall also some of the
[34:13] handful of purpose for her and leave
[34:16] them
[34:17] so
[34:18] that she may glean them
[34:20] and rebuke her not so intentionally
[34:23] amen
[34:24] so if you don't work
[34:26] in the field of boaz
[34:28] you're not gonna get that food
[34:32] [Music]
[34:35] i wish the whole church was here
[34:40] amen
[34:42] that's why i'm missing service except if
[34:44] you have a legitimate order uh
[34:46] reason it's not good amen
[34:49] so
[34:50] roof
[34:51] if she stays at home she's not gonna get
[34:54] that food
[34:56] you get the food only when you labor
[34:59] in other words that's why paul said you
[35:01] don't work
[35:05] you don't eat
[35:06] anybody care
[35:08] so when you work
[35:10] as you're working god is also working
[35:16] so there is your work right here
[35:21] and god's work
[35:23] amen
[35:24] when you do your part
[35:29] everybody okay now
[35:31] when you do your part
[35:32] he does his part
[35:34] but you got to do your part you got
[35:37] initiated
[35:41] if you stay home it's not going to work
[35:43] you got to do something then he does
[35:45] something
[35:46] then at the end you got a double potion
[35:49] [Applause]
[35:49] [Music]
[35:51] everything double
[35:53] everybody care
[35:55] blessed be the name of the lord verse 17
[35:58] so she gleaned in the field until what
[36:03] until evening
[36:04] that's the end at the evening time it's
[36:07] finished and beat out that she had green
[36:10] so somebody is really working how can
[36:13] you make a woman work like that you want
[36:15] to marry her
[36:17] amen
[36:18] see the love of god is different
[36:20] amen and she beat that she had gleaned
[36:24] and it was about a water
[36:29] so the quantity of food
[36:32] of one day
[36:34] one day
[36:36] produced enifa
[36:38] one e5
[36:42] i hope i've spelled it pretty good
[36:45] h
[36:47] one e five
[36:49] of barley
[36:51] what does it mean
[36:54] why only one
[36:56] one day everybody okay
[36:59] and she took it up verse 18 and went
[37:02] into the city
[37:04] and her mother-in-law
[37:06] saw what she had cleaned
[37:08] and she brought forth and gave to her
[37:11] that she had reserved after she was
[37:13] surfaced
[37:16] so she's eating there if you stay home
[37:18] you're not eating at the table of the
[37:20] show bread
[37:21] so every time she goes to the field she
[37:24] has a right to eat
[37:25] and to clean and when she's cleaning
[37:28] she's getting a double potion and when
[37:31] she's leaving home she's leaving home
[37:33] with a nifa of barley one day
[37:37] and nifa of barley
[37:39] so actually the working that she was
[37:42] doing
[37:44] was not in vain
[37:47] amen
[37:48] everybody okay the working that you are
[37:51] doing
[37:52] have some fruit
[37:55] at the end you got food
[37:58] amen
[38:04] be the name of the lord
[38:06] job to verse 22.
[38:10] and naomi said to ruth her
[38:12] daughter-in-law
[38:14] it is good my daughter that you go out
[38:17] with his maiden in other words stay with
[38:20] his commandment
[38:21] do what the man told you to do
[38:24] that they meet you not in any other
[38:26] field
[38:28] it's going to be a problem
[38:30] so she kept fast by the maidens of boaz
[38:34] to glean
[38:35] to the end of barley harvest
[38:38] and of wheat harvest and dwell with her
[38:41] mother-in-law in other words she
[38:44] completed her full cycle
[38:48] of work
[38:49] anybody care
[38:50] until they were nothing they were no
[38:52] more anything to clean
[38:54] the harvest is finished
[38:56] why do you make a woman work until the
[38:58] harvest is finished if you have an
[39:00] intent order
[39:04] let's go to matthew chapter 3.
[39:07] thank you jesus
[39:09] matthew chapter 3 if you dare you can
[39:11] say amen
[39:13] verse five few people

[44:01] they have a proud spirit in their own
[44:05] they're coming like armenians
[44:10] anybody care
[44:11] they already have we are we are the

[45:11] stay right there
[45:13] we must see fruits
[45:19] if no fruit one day the master will

[46:09] that is showing
[46:11] that you truly repented
[46:14] everybody okay
[46:16] let's go to john chapter 6 and then
[46:18] we'll pray
[46:22] or maybe i'm going to read couple again
[46:24] [Music]
[46:25] if you dare you can say amen

[46:31] wednesday wednesday and time
[46:36] john chapter 6 verse 25 if you're there
[46:39] you can say amen
[46:41] and when they found him on the other
[46:43] side of the sea
[46:45] they said to him rubber
[46:47] when came you here
[46:50] jesus look at them it looks like they
[46:51] were looking for jesus
[46:53] they came they say
[46:55] when did you come here
[46:57] if you look at that it seems like they
[46:59] were really searching for jesus
[47:02] verse 26 jesus answered them and say
[47:05] verily verily i say unto you
[47:08] you seek me
[47:10] not because you saw the miracles
[47:13] anybody care
[47:15] but because you did eat the loaves and
[47:18] were filled
[47:21] you are looking for me for food
[47:24] natural food
[47:27] anybody here
[47:30] verse 27
[47:32] lab or not
[47:35] so there is a
[47:36] label that you must do
[47:40] everybody okay
[47:41] there is a work that roof must do
[47:44] there is a labor
[47:47] everybody okay
[47:49] work labor
[47:51] labor not
[47:53] for the meat which perishes
[47:56] all the effort
[47:58] everything you doing to search for me
[48:01] you are doing that for something that is
[48:03] perishing
[48:05] some natural something
[48:07] do not label
[48:09] for those kind of stuff
[48:11] there is an end to it
[48:14] ever here because according to the law
[48:16] of god you will seek first the kingdom
[48:20] of god then everything else will be
[48:24] added unto you
[48:26] you don't seek those things first then
[48:28] the kingdom led
[48:30] it's backward
[48:32] anybody okay so labor not
[48:35] for the meat which perishes
[48:39] but for that meat
[48:41] or the food
[48:43] which endureth to everlasting life
[48:47] in other words you need to do some work
[48:53] anybody here you need to do some labor
[48:56] but you are laboring for something that
[48:59] does not perish
[49:01] something that will bring you to eternal
[49:04] life
[49:06] something that will unite you with
[49:08] borders
[49:10] [Music]
[49:11] into the marriage
[49:13] anybody care
[49:14] so your label is not a label in vain
[49:17] just to go get food and eating
[49:20] if that was the case the roof could go
[49:22] to any field
[49:24] and get food
[49:25] and eat
[49:26] and remain roof
[49:28] amen but boaz told her you remain in
[49:31] this field because this field is more
[49:34] than natural food
[49:37] this food have natural food and
[49:39] redemption
[49:41] you stay right here and work right here
[49:44] but while you're working you're not
[49:45] working for something that perishing
[49:48] because at the lineage of jesus christ's
[49:50] roof
[49:53] was inserted
[49:56] eternal
[49:58] amen
[49:59] to be inserted in that lineage
[50:02] you know to do some work
[50:04] anybody okay
[50:05] label not for the meat which perishes
[50:08] but for the meat which endure to
[50:09] everlasting life which the who
[50:13] so not any kind of meat you gotta get it
[50:16] from the son of man
[50:18] amen
[50:19] the son of man shall give you
[50:22] there is a specific ministry amen
[50:25] for him
[50:27] the son of man
[50:29] has god
[50:30] the father sealed everybody
[50:33] the son of man is the one that have the
[50:35] approval seal of the father you work for
[50:38] him
[50:39] you work for boaz
[50:42] amen get the food of boas
[50:45] get the seed the barley from the field
[50:48] of boas because the field of boas is the
[50:52] field that have been approved
[50:54] to bring redemption
[50:56] not any other field
[50:58] you must stay on the field of boaz the
[51:01] seal of god
[51:03] is on the field of board
[51:05] the scepter of judah is laying right
[51:08] there
[51:10] not anywhere
[51:12] anybody okay
[51:14] verse 28
[51:15] then
[51:16] say dead to him
[51:18] the one that were looking for natural
[51:19] food
[51:20] what shall we do
[51:22] that we might work or do
[51:26] the water

[51:36] answering them look at the work of god
[51:39] you ready

[56:30] ever here the work of god that you
[56:33] believe on him
[56:37] who he has water
[56:40] so if god sent someone
[56:43] [Applause]
[56:46] brother kalima should be screaming at
[56:48] home
[56:49] amen
[56:50] amen if god sent someone
[56:54] amen and god vindicates that person
[56:59] to be his servant
[57:01] when you believe on that person
[57:04] you are already doing the work of god
[57:08] [Music]
[57:10] [Applause]
[57:14] everybody here so far
[57:16] so if you believe only why believe is
[57:20] always followed by works
[57:25] anybody care
[57:27] because what
[57:28] [Music]
[57:30] by first definition
[57:33] works is what
[57:36] faith what
[57:39] everybody here
[57:40] so
[57:41] works
[57:44] are we okay
[57:46] faith is invisible
[57:52] you have faith where is your faith
[57:56] can you see faith
[57:57] if you see you say faith is there faith
[57:59] is death is there where is faith
[58:01] here
[58:02] faith is invisible that's why brother
[58:05] branham said when abraham was justified
[58:08] by faith this is this was something that
[58:12] only god can see that
[58:16] anybody care
[58:18] but what is visible
[58:22] when james say justify by words brother
[58:25] branham said this is what man can see
[58:29] because it's visible
[58:31] anybody care so faith
[58:34] works once you see somebody doing
[58:36] something
[58:38] ever here they gotta be a faith
[58:40] somewhere
[58:43] anybody here so jesus is telling them
[58:46] don't go afterwards
[58:51] because you can have words
[58:53] without faith
[58:57] [Applause]
[59:00] are we catching it
[59:01] you can be in the message for a long
[59:04] time
[59:08] dressing like a message believer acting
[59:11] like a message believer doing things
[59:14] like a message believer but you never
[59:17] believe the message
[59:20] all it takes is after a while
[59:23] just a matter of time
[59:25] you see people falling off the message
[59:28] but they were doing the work of the
[59:29] message
[59:31] they were preaching the message they
[59:33] were dressing like a message believer
[59:35] where are they today
[59:37] they had works
[59:39] but they didn't have faith
[59:42] on the message that they were working
[59:46] anybody here that's why jesus said
[59:49] to do the work of god
[59:52] first you must believe on him that he
[59:55] sent
[59:56] if you believe don't worry about the
[59:59] words
[1:00:02] ever here the words are a result
[1:00:07] of your faith
[1:00:08] [Music]
[1:00:10] everybody okay so far
[1:00:12] let's pray now heavenly father lord we
[1:00:16] are approaching you humbly tonight lord
[1:00:18] father thanking you once again for your
[1:00:21] grace for your love and your mercy

[1:00:28] again this service unto the hand lord we
[1:00:30] have done what any man that you give
[1:00:33] ability to do can do but when it comes
[1:00:36] to interpret the scripture and to
[1:00:38] minister to the precious bread of jesus
[1:00:40] christ he only take a supernatural
[1:00:43] action of the holy spirit that's why i
[1:00:46] pray father that you move me completely
[1:00:48] out of the way may you come tonight lord
[1:00:50] and speak to your children bless them
[1:00:53] and move them to a higher level than

[1:00:58] father may you heal them if they came
[1:01:00] struggling or having something a concern
[1:01:03] in their heart father may you do
[1:01:05] something or speak to them a specific
[1:01:07] lord for the instruction that will free
[1:01:10] them completely for the struggle that
[1:01:12] they're having we commit and ask
[1:01:14] everything lord and rebuke every demonic
[1:01:17] spirit away from this place in the name
[1:01:19] of jesus christ
[1:01:21] amen
[1:01:22] my subject tonight
[1:01:26] is roof
[1:01:28] let me read the scriptures so we can
[1:01:30] blend them together
[1:01:32] psalm 103
[1:01:34] verse 2 says
[1:01:36] bless the lord
[1:01:38] oh my soul
[1:01:40] and forget not all his water
[1:01:43] what are those benefits david
[1:01:46] david is going to tell us the benefit
[1:01:48] which benefit
[1:01:50] there are many benefits david
[1:01:53] which are those benefits
[1:01:55] david said
[1:01:56] forget not all his benefit
[1:02:00] who forgive all that iniquities
[1:02:06] everybody clear
[1:02:08] who here or the water
[1:02:11] so the benefit david is speaking here is
[1:02:15] the forgiveness of sin
[1:02:26] of the body
[1:02:28] anybody care
[1:02:30] in isaiah 53 verse 5
[1:02:33] the bible say
[1:02:34] but he jesus christ
[1:02:38] he was wounded for our transgression
[1:02:43] anybody okay
[1:02:46] transgression
[1:02:48] he was bruised
[1:02:50] for our water
[1:02:52] iniquities the whole package
[1:02:55] everybody care
[1:02:56] your sins your transgression your
[1:02:58] iniquities all of them are bundled up
[1:03:01] everybody
[1:03:02] the chastisement of our peace
[1:03:06] was upon him
[1:03:08] and with his trap we are water
[1:03:11] so we see two things pointed by david
[1:03:16] and by isaiah
[1:03:17] the forgiveness of sin
[1:03:20] transgression and iniquities something
[1:03:23] that you knew better and you did it and
[1:03:25] then the healing of the body in other
[1:03:28] words the atonement
[1:03:32] the propitiation of your sin
[1:03:35] have two major benefit
[1:03:41] i'm going
[1:03:42] slowly lord help me
[1:03:47] your atonement
[1:03:49] is for forgiveness of sin speak of your
[1:03:52] salvation
[1:03:55] amen so when jesus christ died at the
[1:03:58] cross
[1:04:00] amen two pipes open up
[1:04:04] anybody
[1:04:05] one pipe
[1:04:07] is for your healing
[1:04:09] one pipe is for you
[1:04:13] that's why he is el shaddai
[1:04:19] do you know what he means
[1:04:21] he is the breasted one
[1:04:24] but here he has two breasts
[1:04:27] it depends on where you want a nurse
[1:04:30] here you can get nurse for your
[1:04:32] salvation
[1:04:34] or you can be nurse for your healing
[1:04:40] everybody okay so far
[1:04:41] blessed be the name of the lord my
[1:04:44] subject is the four faces of roof
[1:04:48] roof
[1:04:49] laboring
[1:04:52] hallelujah
[1:04:54] brother branham say
[1:04:57] what roof under justification
[1:05:00] do you see say amen
[1:05:02] my brother stay tight on the computer
[1:05:04] roof under
[1:05:06] sanctification doing water
[1:05:09] laboring as water
[1:05:12] brother branham is saying that roof
[1:05:15] under sanctification
[1:05:17] which is on the westlake you remember
[1:05:19] that
[1:05:21] amen means roof is laboring
[1:05:25] and this laboring is a legalistic work
[1:05:31] and the legalistic speaks of the law
[1:05:35] amen
[1:05:36] which law
[1:05:39] amen
[1:05:41] roof resting
[1:05:42] waiting for boaz to return from the
[1:05:45] finish work we're not there yet
[1:05:47] let's get to the laboring of roof
[1:05:49] tonight
[1:05:51] we talked about the tabernacle
[1:05:53] ever here and the three step of the
[1:05:56] tabernacle which is the other court the
[1:05:59] holy place and the holiest amen
[1:06:02] then we took the tabernacle and we
[1:06:04] blended with the story of roof
[1:06:08] amen
[1:06:09] because both the tabernacle
[1:06:12] and the story of hoof
[1:06:14] house the plan of redemption for human
[1:06:17] beings
[1:06:18] amen and those plan could never be
[1:06:22] unfolded except
[1:06:24] after the opening of the seals
[1:06:31] you heard me many times saying at the
[1:06:34] opening of the seals the bible became a
[1:06:37] new
[1:06:39] what does it really mean
[1:06:41] the opening of the seals
[1:06:43] everybody here
[1:06:44] everybody okay so far
[1:06:46] the whole bible that you see here
[1:06:49] was locked with the seals
[1:06:53] everybody here
[1:06:54] and this whole bible is crushed
[1:06:59] here
[1:07:00] every verse of the bible is jesus christ
[1:07:06] everybody cares so far but when you read
[1:07:09] the bible you will not see jesus christ
[1:07:12] in every verse if you read it
[1:07:15] intellectually
[1:07:17] you following me lord help me this is
[1:07:20] heavy amen
[1:07:22] when i opened the story of joseph
[1:07:25] where is jesus christ
[1:07:27] all i see is a child that is born and
[1:07:30] the child that has a gift and the child
[1:07:33] that dream and his dream come to pass
[1:07:35] and his brother hated him and they sent
[1:07:38] him to egypt and finally he became the
[1:07:41] right hand man of pharaoh where is jesus
[1:07:43] christ there did you see the name jesus
[1:07:45] written there
[1:07:46] everybody here
[1:07:48] everybody here so far
[1:07:49] so now
[1:07:50] when we always preach about
[1:07:54] joseph in this church
[1:07:57] in the denomination
[1:07:59] in the message churches
[1:08:01] do we project joseph to you
[1:08:07] who do we
[1:08:08] project but we cannot project jesus
[1:08:12] christ without mentioning joseph
[1:08:17] amen i hope you're getting what i'm
[1:08:18] saying amen
[1:08:20] amen so when we talk about abraham
[1:08:24] we are not projecting abraham to you
[1:08:30] we are projecting jesus christ
[1:08:34] in the life of abraham
[1:08:38] everybody here so far when we say daniel
[1:08:41] said
[1:08:43] isaiah said
[1:08:45] jeremiah say are we projecting jeremiah
[1:08:49] to you
[1:08:50] are we projecting daniel to you are we
[1:08:52] projecting isaiah to you we are not
[1:08:55] projecting prophet to you
[1:08:58] we are projecting the word of god that
[1:09:01] came through the prophet to you
[1:09:06] everybody okay so far so when we say
[1:09:08] brother branham say
[1:09:11] we are projecting brother branham
[1:09:14] we are projecting jesus christ through
[1:09:18] the ministry of brother branham
[1:09:21] everybody here
[1:09:23] when you read the bible
[1:09:25] do you have a problem reading joseph
[1:09:27] because he was a man
[1:09:29] [Music]
[1:09:33] when you read the bible do you have a
[1:09:35] problem with daniel because he was a man
[1:09:39] do you have a problem reading jeremiah
[1:09:41] because he was a man
[1:09:43] do you have a problem reading isaiah
[1:09:45] because he was a man
[1:09:47] do you ever open your bible and you
[1:09:49] begin to look which part was abraham a
[1:09:52] man and which part was abraham a prophet
[1:09:59] everybody here so why is it a problem
[1:10:04] for you with the message of brandon
[1:10:06] branham
[1:10:07] [Applause]
[1:10:09] here until preacher always struggled
[1:10:13] to move brother branham the man from the
[1:10:17] prophet brother branham how can you
[1:10:20] separate abraham from abraham
[1:10:24] [Applause]
[1:10:28] can i shake you a little bit
[1:10:31] even where abraham lied
[1:10:34] [Applause]
[1:10:36] [Music]
[1:10:38] everybody okay everybody okay
[1:10:41] i challenge anybody come and remove that
[1:10:45] scripture from the bible
[1:10:48] [Applause]
[1:10:50] ever here
[1:10:51] that scripture is the word of god
[1:10:54] but it doesn't tell you to lie
[1:10:57] it shows you amazing grace
[1:11:00] that abraham was like you
[1:11:03] [Music]
[1:11:05] everybody cares so far so when i read
[1:11:08] off the weakness of abraham i am not
[1:11:11] there saying because abraham lie i'm not
[1:11:14] going to take this bible scripture i'm
[1:11:16] going to take the bible scripture when
[1:11:17] abraham believed in god
[1:11:20] the lies of abraham
[1:11:22] the strength of abraham and the weakness
[1:11:25] of abraham all of them are the word of
[1:11:29] god
[1:11:31] [Applause]
[1:11:33] everybody okay because god didn't send
[1:11:35] your times and in diverse manner spoke
[1:11:39] to our father by their prophet
[1:11:42] everybody
[1:11:44] so just give me brother pranam the way
[1:11:47] it is
[1:11:48] [Applause]
[1:11:49] what you think is expired that's you
[1:11:53] [Applause]
[1:11:56] everybody so far i don't have time
[1:11:59] to defend to to sit down and try to
[1:12:03] split
[1:12:04] brother branham the man and brother
[1:12:07] brown of the prophet
[1:12:09] because abraham was a man
[1:12:12] isaac was a man
[1:12:14] jacob was a man isaiah was a man
[1:12:18] daniel was a man jesus was a man brother
[1:12:22] branham was a man
[1:12:24] remove this idea
[1:12:28] [Applause]
[1:12:29] [Music]
[1:12:33] everybody killed so far everybody far
[1:12:36] so let's stop playing around
[1:12:39] no this is the main part this is the we
[1:12:41] already know he's a man
[1:12:44] we already know abraham is a man
[1:12:47] we already know joseph was a man
[1:12:51] paul was a man arenas was a man
[1:12:54] what's the problem
[1:12:58] [Music]
[1:13:01] when we repeat here jeremiah jeremiah
[1:13:03] are we talking about the man jeremiah
[1:13:08] you need to understand christ
[1:13:12] everybody so far so this whole bible
[1:13:15] here was sealed by the seal
[1:13:22] and every scripture in the bible
[1:13:25] take a certain level of anointing to
[1:13:29] unlock it
[1:13:34] everybody okay so far
[1:13:36] you can take that scripture
[1:13:38] and you can read and you can read and
[1:13:41] you can read for two years
[1:13:43] you don't understand what it means
[1:13:46] all it takes is a brother to step here
[1:13:49] and take the same scripture
[1:13:52] and begin to read it
[1:13:54] then that scripture is different
[1:13:57] the bible says
[1:13:59] live by faith
[1:14:01] how many people read that
[1:14:04] everybody read that
[1:14:05] the people in the time of paul read that
[1:14:08] the people in the time of arenas read
[1:14:10] that but that scripture was never
[1:14:12] quitting unto them
[1:14:15] but when luther came
[1:14:17] a certain anointing was delivered
[1:14:21] ever here to unlock that scripture
[1:14:26] do you follow me when the scripture is
[1:14:29] unlocked that scripture becomes light
[1:14:33] [Applause]
[1:14:34] [Laughter]
[1:14:38] a virgin shall conceive
[1:14:40] how many people read that in the temple
[1:14:44] how many women read that for how many
[1:14:46] years in israel
[1:14:48] nothing if you ask them a virgin shall
[1:14:50] conceive a virgin circumcision but when
[1:14:53] mary came on the scene
[1:14:55] but here a certain anointing was
[1:14:58] delivered
[1:14:59] that only mary can receive it
[1:15:02] [Applause]
[1:15:06] everybody clear so abraham delivered god
[1:15:10] according to the level of his anointing
[1:15:17] isaac expressed god according to the
[1:15:20] lever of his anointing
[1:15:24] joseph expressed god
[1:15:27] according to the level of his anointing
[1:15:31] daniel expressed god according to the
[1:15:34] level of his understanding
[1:15:37] but when jesus christ came
[1:15:39] he took all that was in joseph
[1:15:42] oh that was in isaiah oh that was in
[1:15:45] jeremiah oh that was in daniel oh that
[1:15:48] was in all the prophets
[1:15:50] and he mixed it together and he put it
[1:15:53] on himself
[1:15:54] that's why he was the fullness of the
[1:15:56] godhead
[1:15:58] [Applause]
[1:16:00] [Music]
[1:16:06] cares so far
[1:16:07] nobody had the right
[1:16:10] to take this call
[1:16:12] to open it
[1:16:13] and say this day
[1:16:16] this scripture is fulfilled
[1:16:18] nobody could do that
[1:16:20] isaiah could not do it
[1:16:23] jeremiah could not do it
[1:16:25] zechariah could not do that s dress
[1:16:28] could not do it nobody can do it it
[1:16:31] takes the fullness of god
[1:16:33] [Music]
[1:16:39] ever here he takes the supreme anointing
[1:16:43] the top anointing
[1:16:45] to unlock that scripture
[1:16:50] everybody okay
[1:16:51] if that anointing have not come yet
[1:16:55] you can play all you want
[1:16:58] nobody will open that door
[1:17:02] everybody cares so far so when that
[1:17:05] anointing came
[1:17:07] on matthew 24 that anointing touched the
[1:17:10] seals and opened the seals
[1:17:15] and nobody sees it
[1:17:17] the people heard it they didn't see it
[1:17:20] because it was not time
[1:17:22] for the seals
[1:17:24] to be open to human being yet
[1:17:30] everybody cares so far
[1:17:32] paul came paul preached and passed up he
[1:17:36] said everything i preached is in part
[1:17:39] in other words there were certain things
[1:17:41] paul
[1:17:42] was not able to unlock it
[1:17:47] everybody here ever here when daniel
[1:17:50] heard the thunders
[1:17:53] then you said what does that mean god
[1:17:55] said
[1:17:58] is not your level
[1:18:01] you already got your portion
[1:18:04] go to sleep
[1:18:06] this anointing is for the end time
[1:18:12] but here i have an appointment
[1:18:16] in the end time that's when i can unlock
[1:18:19] this anointing
[1:18:23] everybody here so far so when it's time
[1:18:26] to open the seals
[1:18:29] because in revelation 5 the book was
[1:18:32] there
[1:18:36] i'm not even i have not even started my
[1:18:38] subject
[1:18:40] i don't know who's blocking that
[1:18:43] everybody here
[1:18:44] in revelation 5 ever here the book was
[1:18:48] there
[1:18:49] the call

[1:18:54] bring your anointing
[1:18:56] [Applause]
[1:19:02] abraham
[1:19:03] come and try this one
[1:19:08] who is what
[1:19:10] to be worthy you must have a certain
[1:19:12] anointing
[1:19:17] and not and that anointing it's not only
[1:19:20] to take the book
[1:19:26] do you follow me
[1:19:27] just to touch that book
[1:19:30] you need an anointing
[1:19:33] and to break the seals you need an
[1:19:36] anointing and to look in the book
[1:19:40] [Applause]
[1:19:46] so it's an anointing
[1:19:53] it is an anointing
[1:19:55] that gives somebody the right
[1:19:59] [Applause]
[1:20:01] the right to touch the book
[1:20:04] or to take the book
[1:20:06] [Applause]
[1:20:09] everybody here
[1:20:10] and it gives you the right to break this
[1:20:13] hero
[1:20:18] and he gives you the right
[1:20:21] to look into that book

[1:28:13] [Music]
[1:28:19] adam and eve have the same age in

[1:28:36] and female
[1:28:39] created he them
[1:28:43] ever here so far

[1:28:47] dirt they have to take the same dirt
[1:28:50] [Applause]
[1:28:51] [Music]
[1:28:54] that was the first adam
[1:28:56] but he is the second adam
[1:28:59] [Applause]

[1:29:13] [Applause]
[1:29:13] [Music]
[1:29:16] everybody cares so far so he is not the
[1:29:19] only one worthy

[1:29:49] everybody cared so far he took the book
[1:29:52] and he sent it down
[1:29:54] but him and the book are
[1:29:57] so when he sent the book down the book
[1:30:00] took him
[1:30:06] you cannot send the book without him
[1:30:09] coming
[1:30:11] that's why in revelation 10 he came down
[1:30:15] he put one foot on the land
[1:30:18] one foot on the right
[1:30:23] ever here
[1:30:24] he said john

[1:31:07] he broke the seal but he didn't eat the
[1:31:10] book

[1:31:58] head of somebody you must do what i did
[1:32:01] over there
[1:32:04] [Music]
[1:32:05] another word john
[1:32:07] now is worthy

[1:32:16] everybody here so far he said go get the
[1:32:19] book and don't stop that tech deadpool

[1:32:30] [Applause]
[1:32:34] [Music]
[1:32:35] over here
[1:32:36] [Applause]
[1:32:37] the book is in the pride
[1:32:40] that's why we have the devil answer
[1:32:43] [Applause]
[1:32:44] that's why we have the opening of the
[1:32:47] seal
[1:32:48] when we move god move
[1:32:50] when we move god moves
[1:32:52] when we move forward god moves when we
[1:32:55] speak god speak
[1:32:57] speak and move forward
[1:33:00] [Applause]
[1:33:00] [Music]
[1:33:02] [Applause]
[1:33:12] hallelujah that's why brother branham
[1:33:15] saying everything that was in god he
[1:33:17] poured that in who
[1:33:24] and everything that was in christ he
[1:33:26] poured that word
[1:33:28] [Applause]
[1:33:33] in the bride
[1:33:35] that's why when they touch the believer
[1:33:37] he says son
[1:33:40] so
[1:33:41] why do you
[1:33:43] did so persecute jesus christ
[1:33:50] [Music]
[1:33:54] so when we say the opening of the seals
[1:33:57] it's the very person of jesus christ
[1:34:00] [Applause]
[1:34:02] it is the supreme anointing
[1:34:04] when you read your bible you need that
[1:34:06] man
[1:34:08] when you listening to the tape you need
[1:34:11] the person
[1:34:12] he is the author of the message
[1:34:15] [Applause]
[1:34:21] he can unlock every scripture in the
[1:34:24] bible
[1:34:25] that's why we don't have limitation in
[1:34:27] the bible he keep unfolding unfolding
[1:34:31] unfolding unfolding unfolding unfolding
[1:34:35] until you reach a conclusion that i
[1:34:37] don't think we will finish this bible
[1:34:39] [Applause]
[1:34:43] look at how many sermons from roof
[1:34:49] because you touch the unlimited
[1:34:52] [Music]
[1:34:54] ever here
[1:34:56] ever here you touch the unlimited
[1:34:59] the opening of the seal release jesus
[1:35:02] christ
[1:35:03] he released the anointing of jesus
[1:35:05] christ
[1:35:07] that's what makes you completely
[1:35:09] different
[1:35:10] it is because of that anointing
[1:35:14] [Applause]
[1:35:15] [Music]
[1:35:16] everybody
[1:35:17] that's the anointing when you sit
[1:35:19] somebody come and say do you remember
[1:35:21] this do you remember this and then you
[1:35:23] leave everything and you put your hand
[1:35:24] up you say wow i never seen that before
[1:35:27] that's him
[1:35:28] [Applause]
[1:35:30] that's him
[1:35:32] amen
[1:35:33] he's not really a book
[1:35:37] he's a
[1:35:40] person everybody here
[1:35:43] have a back here
[1:35:46] i have only few minutes
[1:35:50] amen
[1:35:53] [Applause]
[1:35:55] so when we say the opening of the seal
[1:35:58] that's why when you look at the level
[1:35:59] you will see level when he comes he
[1:36:02] opened the level it's something
[1:36:03] different
[1:36:05] now when you say the level is crushed no
[1:36:07] problem take christ match him with
[1:36:10] christ he unlock it
[1:36:12] the president is crushed you take him
[1:36:14] when he touched the president he's going
[1:36:16] to tell you three means these five this
[1:36:19] look at the height look at this look at
[1:36:20] this because he's the one that wrote to
[1:36:23] that
[1:36:25] israel did not understand what it was
[1:36:28] because everything was here until the
[1:36:30] appointment at the end time so when he
[1:36:33] comes now he's unfolding every planet
[1:36:38] so his bride will never be ignorant
[1:36:40] anymore and you will recognize the devil
[1:36:43] in every trick
[1:36:45] because it's the supreme anointing
[1:36:48] it's the supreme power it's the supreme
[1:36:51] person
[1:36:52] it is the person himself
[1:36:55] [Music]
[1:36:56] it is the author himself that's why you
[1:36:59] heard brother brother say a man know my
[1:37:01] scripture
[1:37:03] but i know that also
[1:37:05] [Applause]
[1:37:08] everybody here and brother branham said
[1:37:10] the preacher challenged him
[1:37:14] do you know what brother branham did he
[1:37:16] took the bible and he put it on the
[1:37:18] pulpit and he stepped aside he said
[1:37:21] everybody that think they know
[1:37:24] more than me come and take the bible
[1:37:27] and disprove me
[1:37:31] do you know what happened
[1:37:33] nobody moved
[1:37:37] do you know why they didn't move
[1:37:39] not because of brother branham
[1:37:42] not because of the bible
[1:37:44] brother branham said he was standing
[1:37:46] right there
[1:37:50] and they knew he was ready
[1:37:53] and they knew which camp he identified
[1:37:56] with
[1:37:57] he identified with the message
[1:38:00] with the messenger that i am vindicated
[1:38:04] this man
[1:38:05] come and dare open that scripture
[1:38:09] [Applause]
[1:38:13] ever here so the one who opened this
[1:38:15] message is not brady branham
[1:38:20] it is jesus christ
[1:38:22] [Music]
[1:38:24] that's why brother branham keep telling
[1:38:27] you you don't understand me do you
[1:38:29] remember genesis 18
[1:38:31] do you remember who was discerning
[1:38:33] abraham
[1:38:35] he said look look look look you you you
[1:38:42] you in other words i'm just a i'm
[1:38:46] an envelope
[1:38:57] it's already now on the compass
[1:39:00] hallelujah
[1:39:02] hallelujah so when we speak about the
[1:39:04] opening of the seals in this church this
[1:39:07] is what we meant
[1:39:09] this is what we mean we mean the very
[1:39:10] person of jesus christ the supreme
[1:39:13] anointing
[1:39:15] amen
[1:39:16] and when he start opening the bible you
[1:39:18] usually feel your heart like a little
[1:39:20] joy like wow why is him
[1:39:28] everybody here
[1:39:30] until you hold it you hold it you hold
[1:39:31] it and after a while you begin to smile
[1:39:33] and before you know you raise up and you
[1:39:36] begin to clap your hand and you begin to
[1:39:38] shout
[1:39:39] because it's him
[1:39:41] it is not brother stephen he is the one
[1:39:44] doing that
[1:39:45] [Applause]
[1:39:45] [Music]
[1:39:52] what should i enter this the opening of
[1:39:54] the seals
[1:39:56] [Applause]
[1:39:57] everybody here so far
[1:39:59] oh my god oh my god
[1:40:02] 908 amen so when they talk about abraham
[1:40:06] forget about brother branham
[1:40:08] forget about brother branham
[1:40:10] when we say brother branham say we know
[1:40:13] what it means
[1:40:14] when we say oh abraham say esther say
[1:40:17] esther was a woman we know that but when
[1:40:20] i'm reading yesterday i'm not leading a
[1:40:22] woman
[1:40:26] so don't come to me and say you see
[1:40:28] you're reading a woman you need to make
[1:40:30] sure you know when it's a woman and when
[1:40:32] it's not a woman when it's the bride of
[1:40:34] christ
[1:40:35] you're bringing confusion
[1:40:37] [Music]
[1:40:40] ever here why should i read the bible
[1:40:43] with confusion
[1:40:45] every time i read this is abraham this
[1:40:46] is not abraham this is a daniel oh right
[1:40:49] here it's not daniel no no this one is
[1:40:52] paul this one he was paul speaking as a
[1:40:54] man this one is paul speaking as uh
[1:40:57] the bible say every scripture is
[1:41:00] inspired
[1:41:01] [Music]
[1:41:02] [Applause]
[1:41:05] do you know that
[1:41:06] do you know that even when moses killed
[1:41:09] somebody he was inspired
[1:41:11] [Music]

[1:41:18] when david kill uriah it's the word of
[1:41:21] god

[1:41:30] human being he can make mistake and he
[1:41:34] knows how to correct
[1:41:35] [Music]
[1:41:36] [Applause]
[1:41:37] [Music]
[1:41:39] so that when jesus christ come he will
[1:41:41] be the only one with that mistake
[1:41:44] so god had to make sure all of them fell
[1:41:47] in some part
[1:41:48] [Applause]
[1:41:52] that's one angle
[1:41:53] if you change the angle
[1:41:55] but sheba is a top of the brother
[1:41:59] her first husband must die
[1:42:02] and david christ must kill your first
[1:42:04] husband so you can get married to him
[1:42:08] [Applause]

[1:42:55] again if that same woman hugged jesus
[1:43:00] [Applause]
[1:43:03] i thought jesus was 100 men
[1:43:06] the bible said demand jesus christ
[1:43:09] why you don't worry about jesus having
[1:43:10] feelings
[1:43:14] because it's a different
[1:43:15] it takes you to a different
[1:43:17] a different level
[1:43:20] when you go to that level the feeling is
[1:43:22] gone you are going to a different height
[1:43:25] [Applause]
[1:43:28] everybody cares so far so you're not
[1:43:30] going to sit here and try to see this is
[1:43:32] moses this is moses knew exactly what he
[1:43:34] was doing
[1:43:36] everything oh joseph was hated for his
[1:43:38] brother yes he has to be hated because
[1:43:40] they have to hate jesus christ
[1:43:45] here they have to reject joseph they
[1:43:47] have to take him and put him on a pit
[1:43:49] and take his court and put a g uh i mean
[1:43:52] a blood and send it back to his father
[1:43:57] when jesus went to hell into the pit see
[1:43:59] spirit have to go back to the father
[1:44:01] father i return my spirit unto you
[1:44:04] have you thought about that
[1:44:08] [Applause]
[1:44:11] have you thought about that
[1:44:13] you see what i'm saying so when you read
[1:44:15] the bible about joseph it's now more
[1:44:18] joseph
[1:44:19] you are looking at jesus christ in every
[1:44:23] scripture
[1:44:24] when you listen to the message brother
[1:44:26] branham said no i was going and then i
[1:44:28] saw hope and hope did this and then my
[1:44:30] two kids and one jump on me and one did
[1:44:33] you think brother branham is talking
[1:44:34] about his family
[1:44:39] everybody okay the ministry of the son
[1:44:42] of man is a ministry that is combined
[1:44:45] with parable
[1:44:51] [Applause]
[1:44:52] everybody here jesus always spoke in
[1:44:55] riddles
[1:44:57] in parable but those parables has
[1:45:00] mysteries
[1:45:01] [Applause]
[1:45:04] [Music]
[1:45:05] everybody cares so far
[1:45:07] everybody cares so far so one brother
[1:45:09] brought up even the family of bradley
[1:45:11] branham
[1:45:12] even the name of his children
[1:45:16] amen why his first child has to be the
[1:45:19] poor
[1:45:21] why paul
[1:45:22] [Applause]
[1:45:25] why why have to start with paul
[1:45:34] ever hear
[1:45:36] why one of his child is sharon
[1:45:39] and sharon have to die
[1:45:41] because the church throughout when he
[1:45:42] starts with paul in the middle of the
[1:45:44] ages death struck because the pair
[1:45:48] because the the white horse already
[1:45:50] changed to a red horse he's killing the
[1:45:52] bride so sharon must die
[1:45:54] but she's resurrected under the sixth
[1:45:56] dimension
[1:45:58] and then rebecca pick up ending up with
[1:46:00] joseph perfection
[1:46:04] i'm not talking about joseph in
[1:46:06] jeffersonville i'm talking about joseph
[1:46:09] in the parable
[1:46:18] you see now
[1:46:20] so his move is not really a move just
[1:46:23] like david was saying my father my
[1:46:26] father why has that forsaken me
[1:46:29] who forsook david
[1:46:30] [Music]
[1:46:33] somebody came he said king king what is
[1:46:34] going on who forsaken you
[1:46:36] and they look at david raising him you
[1:46:38] have forsaken me they look nobody there
[1:46:44] so when you're reading you say no this
[1:46:45] is david getting excited in his house
[1:46:52] but down the road we found somebody at
[1:46:55] the cross saying my father my father why
[1:46:58] are you what
[1:47:00] who was speaking in david
[1:47:05] now god separate david
[1:47:08] and his prophecy
[1:47:11] you must say david saying
[1:47:16] but here that's why the bible says as he
[1:47:19] was written by jeremiah they have to use
[1:47:22] the reference vessel
[1:47:25] plus what god did through that vessel
[1:47:28] that's why we say brother branham saying
[1:47:31] it is saying as a reference
[1:47:38] hey but here because knowing your vessel
[1:47:41] is very important
[1:47:43] for your redemption
[1:47:45] you must know who your husband is
[1:47:52] you don't want to be like jacob you're
[1:47:54] sleeping with a woman you woke up in the
[1:47:56] morning he was not your brother
[1:48:00] he thought he was richer but he was
[1:48:03] clear
[1:48:06] everybody cares of all
[1:48:07] but all of that he looks bad
[1:48:10] but guess what the churches were locked
[1:48:12] right there
[1:48:16] but here you cannot have rachel before
[1:48:19] leah leah is the law
[1:48:21] because as a custom you must give as a
[1:48:24] caster as a law you must get the first
[1:48:26] one the first one will produce the
[1:48:28] patriarch
[1:48:31] and then rachel have to come later to
[1:48:33] produce only two children joseph
[1:48:36] perfection
[1:48:37] and then benjamin the hundred and forty
[1:48:40] four thousand only two
[1:48:42] they are kept toward the end why did god
[1:48:45] lock those womb
[1:48:51] so now go ahead and separate rachel and
[1:48:54] separately again and show me that they
[1:48:56] were just women
[1:49:01] do you see the scripture now
[1:49:03] do you see the scripture now
[1:49:04] so when we say the opening of the seals
[1:49:07] we're talking about the very person of
[1:49:09] jesus christ those people were not
[1:49:11] living their own life
[1:49:16] why do we use your testimony in church
[1:49:20] why
[1:49:21] you went through something
[1:49:23] and then you suffer and you give your
[1:49:25] testimony here and your suffering
[1:49:28] becomes a scripture to brought to
[1:49:30] somebody and that person will pick up
[1:49:32] and say the god that work for sister
[1:49:34] jerusha is gonna do the same for me
[1:49:37] [Music]
[1:49:38] [Applause]
[1:49:39] [Music]
[1:49:40] are we projecting sister jerusalem we
[1:49:43] are projecting the goodness of god in
[1:49:46] the life of sister jerusalem now he
[1:49:49] became a scripture to help somebody
[1:49:59] i am sorry
[1:50:01] i can't preach roof lawboring
[1:50:04] i have to stop here we need to pick up
[1:50:06] on sunday
[1:50:08] let's stand
[1:50:09] [Applause]
[1:50:18] bear with me i need to find a different
[1:50:20] title for this
[1:50:21] and then roof laboring will be on sunday
[1:50:26] this is beyond me
[1:50:29] i prepare everything i have the court is
[1:50:31] loaded but somebody needed this
[1:50:34] [Music]
[1:50:35] everybody here to understand the
[1:50:37] ministry of the son of man so now when
[1:50:40] you read brother branham you don't skip
[1:50:42] anything
[1:50:43] even the story he's telling you you
[1:50:45] don't skip anything
[1:50:48] but here there is always something
[1:50:50] locked up in the story
[1:50:52] i showed you the law
[1:50:55] and then the law under the under
[1:50:57] levitical priesthood and i showed you
[1:50:59] the law on the melchizedek priesthood
[1:51:02] and if you read brother branham you will
[1:51:03] see brother branham say if i go overseas
[1:51:06] and i tell me that i say if you stay
[1:51:08] here you spoke to another woman do you
[1:51:10] think brother branham is just telling
[1:51:11] you a story brother brother she was
[1:51:13] showing you armenianism and calvinism in
[1:51:16] the light in the parable he was saying
[1:51:19] have you caught that
[1:51:21] some people say yes some people say no
[1:51:24] brother branham says
[1:51:27] that if i'm going overseas
[1:51:30] and i call my wife and i say i am
[1:51:33] traveling
[1:51:34] and because i'm traveling
[1:51:37] if i hear you with another man
[1:51:40] that's it i divorce you
[1:51:42] and by the bottom say if his wife also
[1:51:44] say if you go over there and i hear you
[1:51:47] overseas that you hug another woman
[1:51:49] there when you come here you're a
[1:51:50] divorce man brother branham say that's a
[1:51:52] armenianism
[1:51:55] because now brother branham is going
[1:51:58] he's reframing
[1:52:00] to do something bad in fear of divorce
[1:52:05] so if you take divorce off guess what
[1:52:08] he will do it armenianism wrong
[1:52:11] legalistic way in other words you're
[1:52:13] going to create an adulterer man in the
[1:52:16] heart
[1:52:18] because jesus came he said who looked at
[1:52:20] a woman and lasted after her that was
[1:52:23] already adultery before you consume it
[1:52:25] so you have a doctor in the in the mind
[1:52:28] but they have not manifested in the
[1:52:30] flesh yet because they are scared
[1:52:32] they're going to be brought to the
[1:52:34] church and repent in front of everybody
[1:52:36] armenianism
[1:52:40] everybody here but brother brandon say
[1:52:42] what is the balance
[1:52:44] but what i'm saying but if i go and my
[1:52:47] wife said don't worry if he hug another
[1:52:49] woman that's no problem brother branham
[1:52:51] said that's wrong that's calvinist
[1:52:55] my wife doesn't care he says something
[1:52:57] is wrong your wife must care
[1:52:59] hey but here by the brand i'm saying but
[1:53:01] the true balance is right in the middle
[1:53:04] not liberal
[1:53:06] not tight in the middle what is the
[1:53:08] middle brother branham say it is because
[1:53:11] of love
[1:53:12] i love my wife i know if i fall she will
[1:53:16] forgive me
[1:53:17] but i know the pain it's gonna do to her
[1:53:20] even if she's gonna forgive me i don't
[1:53:22] wanna do something that will hurt her a
[1:53:25] woman that loves me so much in
[1:53:27] appreciation to the love i cannot do
[1:53:30] something like this now it's love
[1:53:32] balancing you you don't go one extreme
[1:53:35] you don't go the other extreme you step
[1:53:37] in the middle you know more on the
[1:53:38] calvinism you know more and armenianism
[1:53:41] in your marriage now your marriage is
[1:53:43] barely stopped now you don't worry about
[1:53:45] your husband even if it's past time if
[1:53:48] somebody say are you sure your husband
[1:53:50] is coming up you say don't worry look at
[1:53:51] the clock when it's two o'clock you're
[1:53:52] gonna see him right here how do you know
[1:53:54] it's two o'clock he's right there why
[1:53:56] because of love he can't wait to go back
[1:53:58] home
[1:53:59] that is the true love but brother
[1:54:01] branham was telling those two doctrine
[1:54:03] under a story
[1:54:08] because it's the ministry of the son of
[1:54:10] man it's a ministry that uses parable
[1:54:14] and riddles and things like that and all
[1:54:16] those parables and readers are things
[1:54:18] that the lord is telling you something
[1:54:21] here something here something here
[1:54:23] something here something here if you
[1:54:25] miss it you're going to miss the very
[1:54:26] purpose that brother branham is telling
[1:54:28] you
[1:54:29] everything was correct
[1:54:31] brother branham wanted to go to the west
[1:54:33] but if you look brother branham stay on
[1:54:35] the uh on the east he stay in
[1:54:38] jeffersonville and brad brown made even
[1:54:41] a promise that i cannot preach a new
[1:54:43] message until i start that message in
[1:54:45] jeffersonville if not brother branham
[1:54:48] would have preached the seals on the
[1:54:50] west
[1:54:51] but why did brother brother make that
[1:54:52] statement
[1:54:54] why they still have to be preached only
[1:54:56] on the east side and not on the west
[1:54:58] side
[1:55:00] take the dollar bill flip it
[1:55:04] and see where is the ego with the scroll
[1:55:06] in the mouth it's on the east side
[1:55:10] check your one dollar view
[1:55:12] and if you look the pyramid and the
[1:55:15] constellation coming down it's on the
[1:55:16] west coast
[1:55:19] in other words brother brother must go
[1:55:21] to the west to meet the angel but the
[1:55:24] preaching the ego with a scroll in his
[1:55:27] mouth must be on the east side the
[1:55:30] dollar sign put that on the east side
[1:55:32] and brother branham never talk about
[1:55:33] that ego with something over there
[1:55:37] so the seal must be preached only on the
[1:55:39] east brother madame thought he made it
[1:55:41] was him that did that it was not him
[1:55:44] it's the ministry of the son of man
[1:55:52] that's why we need that person
[1:55:56] that's why you heard when we say the
[1:55:58] message is crushed we're not talking
[1:56:00] about the paper
[1:56:04] we're talking about the very person of
[1:56:06] the message
[1:56:07] when you meet him he will explain you
[1:56:09] what brother branham is saying
[1:56:12] even if brother branham says something
[1:56:14] you don't understand he have two ways
[1:56:16] sometimes he look he tells you what it
[1:56:18] is sometimes he wait
[1:56:20] he touched brother stephen he said cause
[1:56:22] preacher so-and-so because i delivered
[1:56:24] something to him and brother stephen
[1:56:26] called that preacher and that preacher
[1:56:28] come here on wednesday and when that
[1:56:29] preacher begin to preach and all your
[1:56:31] answers are coming up it is him that is
[1:56:33] orchestrating all these things
[1:56:37] [Applause]
[1:56:42] and to show you that it's him
[1:56:45] most of the time or all the time a
[1:56:48] preacher comes here why do we dovetail
[1:56:52] why do they have to say something we
[1:56:54] already preach here and all of you are
[1:56:56] like
[1:56:58] to show you that it's the same being
[1:57:01] that is moving up and orchestrating
[1:57:03] everything
[1:57:04] that's the person you need for your life
[1:57:10] amen
