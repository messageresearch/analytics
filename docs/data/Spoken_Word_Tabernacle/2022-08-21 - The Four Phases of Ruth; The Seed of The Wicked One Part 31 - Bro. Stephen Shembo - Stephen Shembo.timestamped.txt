[6:57] meeting i started thinking
[6:58] [Music]
[7:00] these songs were meant for this morning
[7:02] and they're not strange songs but it
[7:04] just
[7:05] i believe brother stephen read the
[7:06] scripture yesterday about how great our
[7:09] god is it was almost like the scripture
[7:11] that the song was written from
[7:13] but it just the songs that i picked
[7:15] seemed to make sense after the meeting
[7:18] yesterday i sure did enjoy that amen

[49:23] genesis chapter 2.
[49:28] if you missed it yesterday you need a
[49:30] very real pretty good attention
[49:34] because somebody is ahead of you
[49:39] if you dare you can say amen
[49:44] we announced these things like a month
[49:46] ago
[49:48] and still somebody misses it
[49:50] one month
[49:52] still somebody misses it
[49:54] except you have a legitimate reason
[49:58] but you should not because you have one
[50:00] month to prepare
[50:02] these are stuff of the kingdom
[50:05] one of these days they will shut down
[50:07] everything that you have
[50:09] and you will remember god
[50:12] amen
[50:13] don't wait like other people have a
[50:16] tendency they only get closer to god
[50:18] where things are going wrong in the life
[50:21] and once things begin to get relaxed
[50:23] then the rights again then they go back
[50:26] if you see them in church you know that
[50:28] something is wrong in their lives
[50:30] as soon as everything is resolved they
[50:32] run away they don't have time for
[50:34] anything they can put everything in
[50:37] front of god's things
[50:39] it's only a church time that they have
[50:41] to do this they have to do this they
[50:43] have to do this only on wednesday night
[50:45] that's when they're going to do this
[50:46] this this only when we have this that's
[50:49] when we plan this and this and this
[50:51] don't be don't stop stop doing that the
[50:54] time is gone amen
[50:56] genesis chapter 2 if you're not doing
[50:58] that you say amen
[51:03] genesis chapter 2 verse 16. if you do
[51:06] you can say amen
[51:10] i don't want to face god with your blood
[51:12] in my hand
[51:14] no i want to go home peacefully
[51:16] [Music]
[51:20] everybody okay
[51:22] verse 16.
[51:25] brother caleb if you can work on it i
[51:27] don't know where it's coming from
[51:29] and the lord god commanded the man he
[51:32] remembered this yesterday
[51:35] saying of every tree
[51:38] of the garden
[51:39] don't forget i needed a little bit too
[51:42] of every tree of the garden you may
[51:45] freely eat you may be seated
[51:48] so the commandment god gave to adam
[51:53] amen
[51:54] is to eat everything
[51:58] that is eatable
[52:00] eat of every tree
[52:02] and we know that among the trees we have
[52:05] natural trees
[52:07] you remember
[52:09] that were there for natural food
[52:12] and we also have a spiritual
[52:14] tree
[52:15] amen
[52:17] that was the tree of life
[52:19] which we know was who
[52:25] christ amen
[52:28] you can eat everything so men
[52:31] have an access
[52:33] to the tree of life
[52:35] freely
[52:36] given to him because men
[52:39] men shall not live by
[52:41] but by every
[52:43] everybody okay
[52:48] verse 17
[52:49] but
[52:50] of the tree of the knowledge of good and
[52:53] evil
[52:54] you shall not eat of it
[52:57] for in the day that you shall eat
[53:00] thereof you shall die
[53:03] you shall surely die
[53:06] it is clear
[53:08] so there is another tree here which is
[53:11] the tree of the knowledge of good
[53:15] and evil amen if you touch this tree
[53:20] it's guaranteed 100 guaranteed
[53:24] you will surely die
[53:27] amen so it's a tree of death
[53:31] which we know that was who
[53:35] lucifer satan
[53:38] everybody okay
[53:41] praise be to the name of god verse 18
[53:44] and the lord god say
[53:46] it is not good that man should be alone
[53:51] in other words when this commandment was
[53:53] given eve was not there
[53:59] did you see eve here
[54:02] because adam was still alone
[54:04] it was adam who preached to eve
[54:07] the gospel
[54:10] everybody okay
[54:13] the husband
[54:14] your husband
[54:16] your husband
[54:17] that you praying god for
[54:19] that man that you dreaming all the time
[54:23] must be able to teach you the word
[54:29] am i okay
[54:30] am i okay your husband must be able to
[54:34] open the scripture home
[54:36] and tell you about the message
[54:39] if your husband doesn't tell you about
[54:41] the message he need to go back in the
[54:43] scripture that's why you need to be more
[54:46] working double
[54:48] you get me you need to work double you
[54:51] need to take note
[54:53] because you're going to sit with a woman
[54:54] at home that would be looking at you and
[54:57] say i do not understand this
[54:59] [Music]
[55:01] you don't get me matter of fact the
[55:03] bible says if a woman doesn't understand
[55:07] something in church she need to go back
[55:09] home
[55:10] and ask her husband the husband doesn't
[55:14] read the message the husband doesn't
[55:16] listen to the team the husband doesn't
[55:19] want to read the cod book
[55:21] what are you going to teach
[55:24] teach politics
[55:26] teach facebook
[55:28] or teach about what tesla is doing
[55:31] or what cadillac brand is coming up
[55:40] i'm a man i'm a man i'm a man there is
[55:43] more that goes with a man
[55:46] man is not the head head head head
[55:49] the head means responsibility
[55:51] [Music]
[55:56] you don't even know how to pray
[56:00] if we put you here and just give you the
[56:02] microphone pray for the sick you'll see
[56:05] how you're struggling you don't even
[56:07] remember verses
[56:14] for you to be able to pray good you must
[56:17] know the word
[56:18] because when you pray in god god is not
[56:21] impressed with your feeling
[56:24] god is not impressed with your talking
[56:27] god is impressed by his word remind him
[56:31] his word
[56:33] he is impressed by what he already spoke
[56:37] what are you pressing god for
[56:39] you know papa god are you a good god he
[56:42] already is a good god
[56:46] remind him you say you said in your word
[56:49] isaiah said
[56:51] moses saved that's why i'm coming
[56:55] [Music]
[57:09] glory to
[57:10] god amen brother stephen preach
[57:16] [Music]
[57:23] god give you a heart potato my friend
[57:26] you got to deal with me all the way to
[57:28] the rapture
[57:30] let's go to genesis uh chapter
[57:33] 2 still verse 18 and the lord god said
[57:35] it is not good
[57:37] that the man shall be alone i will make
[57:40] him a help meet for him when god was
[57:44] creating everything it was good
[57:46] it was good
[57:48] it was good
[57:49] this is the first time it was not good
[57:54] that's where the trouble started
[57:57] we okay
[57:58] job two verse uh
[58:02] 24.
[58:04] i just want to say something there
[58:06] the bible says therefore is not there on
[58:09] the board
[58:10] shall a man leave his father
[58:13] and his mother and shall cling to his
[58:16] wife
[58:17] and there shall be one flesh
[58:19] in other words
[58:21] eve and adam were married
[58:25] god married them the first marriage that
[58:27] was performed in a bible it was god
[58:29] himself who married the people
[58:34] god pick his daughter and bring him to
[58:36] the altar
[58:38] and he posed his daughter and he went to
[58:40] the pulpit and blessed them
[58:42] amen
[58:44] okay
[58:47] verse 25 and they were both naked
[58:51] the man and his wife and they were not
[58:53] ashamed
[58:54] they were married but the marriage was
[58:56] no longer consumed it was no not yet
[59:00] consumed so what i'm trying to point out
[59:02] there is the woman we call her the woman
[59:05] here we know down the road she changed
[59:07] into eve the woman was a married woman
[59:13] amen as soon as god created eve
[59:16] automatically he took eve and hook her
[59:18] in marriage
[59:20] why
[59:22] why he didn't give eve some time
[59:28] why he didn't give eve some time like no
[59:30] you go ahead and spend some time as soon
[59:33] as you come up god look he's saying
[59:35] [Music]
[59:39] stay with adam
[59:42] there is a reason why not today down the
[59:44] road
[59:45] everybody care let's go to chapter three
[59:48] amen
[59:50] verse one if you dare you can say amen
[59:53] you know what it means now the bible
[59:55] says and now the serpent i'm sorry was
[59:58] more sadder you know what subtility
[1:00:00] means now
[1:00:03] remember
[1:00:04] we know what it means right
[1:00:06] there is one more subtlety i have let me
[1:00:08] see if i can touch it today now the
[1:00:10] serpent was more sadder than any beast
[1:00:13] of the field you understand now
[1:00:15] which the lord god has made
[1:00:18] and he said to the woman
[1:00:20] yea
[1:00:21] has god say you shall not eat
[1:00:24] of every tree
[1:00:26] of the garden amen
[1:00:29] did god say every tree
[1:00:35] god spoke only one tree
[1:00:37] but he doesn't touch the tree
[1:00:40] he goes generally you point him
[1:00:44] he start general
[1:00:45] i've heard that there is something going
[1:00:47] on like he doesn't know what he's
[1:00:48] talking about
[1:00:51] [Music]
[1:00:52] that's the devil
[1:00:54] he acts like he doesn't know maybe let
[1:00:56] me ask a question so god said you shall
[1:00:58] not itch off any tree in the garden
[1:01:01] is that what god say
[1:01:06] you see
[1:01:08] verse two and the woman said to the
[1:01:10] serpent we may eat now the woman now is
[1:01:14] showing that she was taught by adam
[1:01:17] you may eat
[1:01:18] of the fruit of the tree of the garden
[1:01:22] everybody you
[1:01:24] but
[1:01:25] the fruit
[1:01:27] of the tree which is in the midst of the
[1:01:30] garden
[1:01:31] god has said
[1:01:33] you shall not eat of it
[1:01:36] neither shall you water
[1:01:38] did god use the word touch
[1:01:42] because when you speak to somebody the
[1:01:44] first time
[1:01:46] when god speak
[1:01:47] everybody okay
[1:01:49] god speak directly
[1:01:51] but when the preacher takes what god
[1:01:53] spoke
[1:01:54] and expanded to the church the church
[1:01:58] began to have more understanding of what
[1:02:01] god spoke
[1:02:03] is it okay
[1:02:04] in other words when god spoke to adam
[1:02:07] god used the word eat
[1:02:10] god
[1:02:11] to adam god used the word eat
[1:02:16] amen
[1:02:17] but when adam the preacher
[1:02:20] took the word eat
[1:02:22] and broke it down to eve
[1:02:24] to the woman everybody okay
[1:02:27] the woman came up with the understanding
[1:02:30] that eat
[1:02:35] keep on moving
[1:02:37] you're coming up
[1:02:38] somebody's waking up now
[1:02:40] it is the same as what
[1:02:45] that's why you need the firefall
[1:02:47] ministry
[1:02:48] [Music]
[1:02:52] anybody okay
[1:02:53] anybody okay
[1:02:54] anybody okay if you don't have a firefox
[1:02:57] ministry you'll be stuck here
[1:03:00] it is the minister that break it down
[1:03:04] this and this don't contradict
[1:03:10] it just help you understand more
[1:03:14] you say eat touch for you
[1:03:18] mentally speaking it's different
[1:03:20] what is even eating is
[1:03:23] touching is
[1:03:24] that's what you think
[1:03:26] let's move forward
[1:03:28] amen
[1:03:30] god has said you shall not eat of it
[1:03:34] neither shall you touch it unless you do
[1:03:36] what
[1:03:38] so eating and touches
[1:03:40] bring you to death
[1:03:43] update amen
[1:03:45] glory to god verse 4 and the serpent
[1:03:48] said to the woman
[1:03:50] you shall not
[1:03:53] remember god says surely die
[1:03:56] watch you remember yesterday
[1:03:59] the serpent
[1:04:02] the serpent
[1:04:04] say
[1:04:05] you shall
[1:04:06] not
[1:04:09] surely
[1:04:12] everybody okay
[1:04:14] surely die
[1:04:16] surely die is correct
[1:04:18] if you were there yesterday
[1:04:20] the only difference between the speech
[1:04:23] of the devil
[1:04:24] and the speech of the devil and the
[1:04:26] speech of god is the word
[1:04:31] when the devil
[1:04:33] say
[1:04:34] to eve
[1:04:35] you shall surely not
[1:04:38] what is he doing
[1:04:43] okay
[1:04:44] job to verse five
[1:04:46] why
[1:04:48] what does it mean you shall not surely
[1:04:50] die
[1:04:52] verse
[1:04:53] uh verse 5
[1:04:55] for god knows
[1:04:57] everybody clear
[1:04:59] in the days you eat thereof
[1:05:03] then your what
[1:05:06] the devil
[1:05:07] is pointing
[1:05:09] the eating
[1:05:12] i'm going slowly
[1:05:14] he's connected to the eyes
[1:05:19] everybody okay
[1:05:21] the day that you shall eat thereof
[1:05:24] then your eyes shall be opened
[1:05:30] the opening of the eyes
[1:05:34] amen
[1:05:36] and
[1:05:37] you shall be like who
[1:05:40] knowing good and what
[1:05:42] you shall be your eye when you eat
[1:05:45] number one your eyes are open number two
[1:05:48] you shall be like god
[1:05:52] in the sense that you begin to know
[1:05:55] you remember yesterday
[1:05:57] good and what
[1:05:59] they were already god
[1:06:02] remember yesterday
[1:06:04] but they lack the knowledge
[1:06:07] of good and evil
[1:06:09] everybody okay so the devil told them
[1:06:12] that if you eat of this tree
[1:06:14] you will add the missing knowledge
[1:06:18] everybody here that god has but you

[1:06:36] and when the woman so

[1:07:06] when the woman saw everybody clear
[1:07:09] that the tree was good
[1:07:12] for food
[1:07:15] so the tree is no longer bad
[1:07:17] god say
[1:07:18] if you eat it you're gonna die it means
[1:07:22] it's a bad thing
[1:07:23] anybody care but the devil turn it to be
[1:07:27] a good thing
[1:07:29] anybody okay

[1:07:33] and that
[1:07:34] it is pleasant to the water
[1:07:38] everybody okay you bring pleasure to the
[1:07:41] eye
[1:07:45] i can enter many domains right here amen

[1:07:52] so this tree
[1:07:54] when eve detected that he causes desire
[1:08:03] am i reading a different bible
[1:08:06] are we reading a different bible
[1:08:09] if satan only say you shall surely you
[1:08:13] shall not surely die
[1:08:15] when you eat your eyes will be
[1:08:18] and you'll be like
[1:08:19] that's what satan said that's it
[1:08:22] but when the message of satan
[1:08:26] we okay
[1:08:28] arrive into eve
[1:08:31] that message
[1:08:33] begin to affect the eyes of evil

[1:09:04] it was pleasant to the eyes
[1:09:07] come on and a tree to be

[1:10:20] of both of them were open
[1:10:24] the eyes of
[1:10:25] eve was already open
[1:10:27] remember
[1:10:28] the eyes of both of them were open
[1:10:32] and they knew that they were
[1:10:34] naked and they saw fig leaves together
[1:10:38] and made themselves water

[1:10:44] enmity between you and the woman
[1:10:47] between the serpent
[1:10:49] and the woman amen
[1:10:51] between you and the woman and between
[1:10:53] your seed and her seed so the serpent
[1:10:57] has a seed
[1:11:01] and the woman has a seed
[1:11:04] we need to find out what are those seeds
[1:11:07] amen

[1:12:02] what do you want me to anoint you to see
[1:12:04] [Music]
[1:12:06] amen
[1:12:07] if she ate she uses her mouth they need
[1:12:10] to curse the mouth
[1:12:14] why are they crossing the womb
[1:12:17] what is the connection between the mouth
[1:12:19] and the womb
[1:12:21] can't you see
[1:12:22] [Music]
[1:12:25] i will multiply your conception in
[1:12:28] sorrow you shall bring forth water
[1:12:31] and your water

[1:12:45] let's go now to matthew 13.
[1:12:52] we okay
[1:12:53] remember eve
[1:12:55] the woman ate
[1:12:58] first
[1:12:59] then she went and gave it to her husband
[1:13:03] she didn't go the next day
[1:13:07] the baba didn't say and the next day she
[1:13:09] went
[1:13:10] as soon as she forget
[1:13:12] she went to her husband
[1:13:13] there is a timing problem there
[1:13:16] let's go to matthew chapter 13.
[1:13:19] if you're there you can say amen verse
[1:13:21] 24
[1:13:23] glory to god
[1:13:25] another parable put he forth to them
[1:13:28] saying
[1:13:30] the kingdom of heaven
[1:13:32] is likened to a man
[1:13:35] which saw good seed in his field so
[1:13:39] [Laughter]
[1:13:42] so there is a man
[1:13:44] not on the field
[1:13:46] and in this field the man put his seed
[1:13:49] there
[1:13:51] amen good sin
[1:13:53] but he was not really the man
[1:13:55] he was the
[1:13:57] you can work on this my brother i don't
[1:13:58] know what's going on amen the kingdom as
[1:14:01] a man who saw good seed in his field
[1:14:04] verse 25
[1:14:06] but while
[1:14:07] the one man slept
[1:14:10] if you look another translation it means
[1:14:12] that by that night
[1:14:15] when the workers went to sleep
[1:14:21] let's help
[1:14:23] this man took his worker
[1:14:26] they went to his field
[1:14:28] and they put seed there everybody okay
[1:14:31] amen
[1:14:32] that was during the day
[1:14:37] during the day
[1:14:38] you don't go to your garden at night
[1:14:40] putting seed
[1:14:42] [Music]
[1:14:46] everybody okay
[1:14:48] but at night
[1:14:50] so the interval is not far away
[1:14:57] everybody okay
[1:14:58] at night
[1:15:00] so it's only hours difference
[1:15:04] somebody came and began to put wrong
[1:15:07] seed
[1:15:09] not in a different field
[1:15:12] [Music]
[1:15:15] anybody okay
[1:15:17] let me see where we are
[1:15:20] all right not in a different field
[1:15:22] amen
[1:15:23] so two people
[1:15:26] two people a man
[1:15:28] and mr x are using the same field
[1:15:32] the man has a seed
[1:15:34] mr x also have a seed
[1:15:37] they are using the same field
[1:15:39] but they are sowing seed at difference
[1:15:43] interval
[1:15:44] [Music]
[1:15:48] everybody okay
[1:15:50] but one man slap his enemy so mr x is an
[1:15:54] enemy
[1:15:57] he's an enemy to mix to the man
[1:16:00] we need to know who is this man and who
[1:16:02] is the enemy amen
[1:16:05] the enemy come and saw tears
[1:16:08] among the wheat
[1:16:10] and went his way
[1:16:11] but when the blood was sprung up
[1:16:14] and brought forth fruit then appeared
[1:16:16] the tears also
[1:16:19] in other words the fruit came at the
[1:16:22] same time
[1:16:25] so they were sown
[1:16:27] within
[1:16:28] a short interval that's why both of them
[1:16:32] are coming
[1:16:34] everybody okay
[1:16:35] everybody okay
[1:16:37] so this field brought twins yes
[1:16:42] [Music]
[1:16:46] this field brought the wheat
[1:16:50] and the tears
[1:16:52] and both of them came at the same time
[1:16:54] in other words they were both
[1:16:57] at the same time
[1:17:01] [Music]
[1:17:02] you should be able to already get the
[1:17:03] sermon
[1:17:04] [Music]
[1:17:06] everybody okay
[1:17:08] but when verse 26 the bread was sprung
[1:17:10] up
[1:17:11] and brought for fruit then appeared the
[1:17:14] tear also so both of them were birthed
[1:17:16] at the same time
[1:17:18] so the servant of the household
[1:17:22] of the householder came and said to him
[1:17:24] sir
[1:17:25] did not use so good seed in your field
[1:17:28] from where then has he tears
[1:17:31] he said to them an enemy
[1:17:34] has done this
[1:17:36] the servant said to him will you then
[1:17:40] that we go and gather them up
[1:17:42] let's stop there let's go to second
[1:17:45] corinthians then we pray
[1:17:50] in eden the commandment was
[1:17:53] eat everything
[1:17:54] do not touch
[1:17:56] the tree
[1:17:57] of the knowledge of good and evil
[1:17:59] because it's death as you're flipping
[1:18:00] your bible
[1:18:02] we're dealing with a married woman
[1:18:04] if
[1:18:05] god to adam say eat
[1:18:08] but to eve it means not only eat it
[1:18:11] means eat and touch
[1:18:13] the serpent say
[1:18:15] or just added one word
[1:18:17] not surely die
[1:18:20] what does it mean
[1:18:21] he says when you eat your eyes are open
[1:18:24] and you will know good and evil
[1:18:27] the woman says as soon as she gathered
[1:18:30] the message is transferred decoded in a
[1:18:33] woman opening giving pleasure to the
[1:18:35] eyes causing desires and then making one
[1:18:39] wise there is a seed there there is a
[1:18:42] seed there according to matthew 1 field
[1:18:45] twins wheat and tears
[1:18:47] planted by two people
[1:18:50] second corinthians chapter 11 verse 13
[1:18:53] if you're there you can say amen
[1:18:55] for such as our false apostle
[1:18:59] deceitful worker
[1:19:01] transforming themselves into the
[1:19:03] apostles of what
[1:19:08] and no matter
[1:19:09] for satan himself
[1:19:12] is transformed
[1:19:14] into an angel of water
[1:19:16] so you need to be very careful
[1:19:19] if you're waiting for satan to come with
[1:19:21] big horn like this
[1:19:25] and looking scary like halloween stuff
[1:19:29] they know you're not gonna cope with
[1:19:30] halloween
[1:19:32] they know that for sure amen
[1:19:34] therefore it is no great thing if his
[1:19:38] ministers
[1:19:39] also be transformed as the ministers of
[1:19:44] righteousness whose end shall be
[1:19:47] according to their work so the apostle
[1:19:51] of satan
[1:19:52] and satan himself and the ministers of
[1:19:55] satan they can change form
[1:20:00] but you gotta know how to decode them
[1:20:03] amen
[1:20:04] now let's pray heavenly father
[1:20:06] lord we are approaching you again humbly
[1:20:09] this morning father thanking you for
[1:20:11] your grace for your love and your mercy
[1:20:14] and for everything you have been doing
[1:20:15] for us
[1:20:16] father this is as far as a man can go
[1:20:19] when you give him an ability but when he
[1:20:21] comes lord father to feeding your
[1:20:23] children and to open the word into the
[1:20:26] heart of your children it takes only the
[1:20:29] supernatural work of the holy spirit
[1:20:31] father may you move me completely out of
[1:20:33] the way may you seal every demonic
[1:20:36] spirit away from this place may your
[1:20:38] children be completely free and may they
[1:20:41] enjoy the blessings of heaven be the
[1:20:43] alpha and the omega and touch those that
[1:20:45] are struggling in the body may you heal
[1:20:48] them father in the name of jesus christ
[1:20:51] amen
[1:20:52] i want to remind you again of this
[1:20:54] brother brad i'm saying scripture does
[1:20:57] not play with words
[1:21:00] whatever is in the record
[1:21:02] it's there for the anointed eyes to see
[1:21:05] it is there for a purpose everybody okay
[1:21:09] my subject this morning is the four
[1:21:12] phases of roof the seed of the wicked
[1:21:16] one
[1:21:17] we are still in the trail of the serpent
[1:21:20] the seed of the wicked one
[1:21:22] everybody okay
[1:21:24] we're still on the church in florida
[1:21:25] with ruth
[1:21:27] we still under the
[1:21:29] parable of the 10th virgin where we're
[1:21:31] dealing with the second oil and in our
[1:21:33] tabernacle we are deep in the holiest
[1:21:36] where we're dealing with roof
[1:21:38] resting everybody okay
[1:21:41] when we dealt with the parable of the
[1:21:45] tenth virgin we found out that the
[1:21:47] virgin went
[1:21:48] as they were engaged and paul was the
[1:21:52] one that stated that he have engaged or
[1:21:55] is past the bride of jesus christ but
[1:21:57] paul did not marry them because he
[1:22:00] didn't have the enough equipment to
[1:22:02] marry the brother everybody okay so far
[1:22:05] so as they were going we found out that
[1:22:08] there was a time that the virgin were
[1:22:10] sleeping they all slumbered and slept
[1:22:13] and for some reason there was a midnight
[1:22:15] cry that came in
[1:22:17] and the midnight cry unfolded the second
[1:22:21] oil
[1:22:22] amen
[1:22:23] when we dealt with the second oil we
[1:22:26] found out that the second oil was the
[1:22:29] oil that was dormant throughout the
[1:22:31] edges
[1:22:33] it is the anointing
[1:22:37] they all represent the spirit
[1:22:40] it is the holy spirit
[1:22:44] amen
[1:22:45] but this anointing
[1:22:48] was not working
[1:22:50] it was an anointing that was dormant
[1:22:54] amen
[1:22:56] but this anointing
[1:22:58] was activated
[1:23:00] by
[1:23:01] the midnight cry
[1:23:04] [Music]
[1:23:05] amen
[1:23:06] so without the midnight cry you cannot
[1:23:09] use that anointing
[1:23:11] amen it was at the time that the
[1:23:14] midnight cry came that's when the virgin
[1:23:17] realized that this first oil was already
[1:23:19] running out and they need something to
[1:23:21] supply on their lamp that's when the
[1:23:24] second one came into place amen so the
[1:23:26] midnight cry here we know that he marked
[1:23:30] the end of the first oil
[1:23:34] everybody okay
[1:23:35] now if you watch verse 6 carefully the
[1:23:39] bible says that
[1:23:41] at midnight cry there was a cry made
[1:23:47] the bible says the bible don't play with
[1:23:49] words
[1:23:51] there was a cry
[1:23:53] or you can call it a shout
[1:23:56] and the cry was made
[1:23:59] in other words this cry didn't come out
[1:24:02] by itself
[1:24:05] anybody care
[1:24:06] somebody cried
[1:24:08] [Applause]
[1:24:10] amen so they cry speak of a person
[1:24:16] [Music]
[1:24:19] everybody okay
[1:24:21] this cry is a voice
[1:24:26] everybody here
[1:24:28] so when they say the midnight cry it is
[1:24:31] not really just the cry there is
[1:24:34] somebody that is releasing the cry
[1:24:38] everybody okay
[1:24:40] everybody okay
[1:24:41] and that person is not the bridegroom
[1:24:47] [Music]
[1:24:49] you remember last night young people you
[1:24:52] remember my message
[1:24:53] [Laughter]
[1:24:55] the bible says the christ said behold
[1:24:58] the bridegroom does water
[1:25:01] so it was not the bridegroom who spoke
[1:25:05] everybody here so the cry is a person
[1:25:09] this person is different than the blood
[1:25:12] groom
[1:25:15] amen
[1:25:16] it's only a person
[1:25:20] that is introducing
[1:25:26] amen
[1:25:27] that is introducing the brethren
[1:25:32] amen so they cry
[1:25:35] the shout
[1:25:37] the voice
[1:25:38] and the person i won
[1:25:45] everybody okay
[1:25:47] let's go to genesis chapter 2 3.
[1:25:53] you see how many times you can read this
[1:25:55] parable because the scriptures have
[1:25:57] layers
[1:26:00] do you know the bologna ham
[1:26:02] they cut them in layers
[1:26:04] so you take the first one you eat there
[1:26:06] is a second way that's how the scripture
[1:26:08] works
[1:26:13] let's go to genesis chapter 3
[1:26:16] if you dare you can say amen
[1:26:19] so when they say the midnight cry
[1:26:21] something was hidden in that scripture
[1:26:25] amen
[1:26:26] what was hidden was there was an
[1:26:28] introducer
[1:26:31] there was a messenger
[1:26:34] [Music]
[1:26:37] but when you read the bible he only said
[1:26:39] the midnight cry that's a superficial
[1:26:42] layer
[1:26:43] you need to remove the superficial layer
[1:26:45] when you look under you're gonna see
[1:26:47] there is a person when you move the
[1:26:49] layer that person is a messenger but
[1:26:52] that person is not the bridegroom but
[1:26:54] he's introducing the broad room
[1:26:58] [Music]
[1:27:00] everybody okay
[1:27:03] let's go to genesis chapter 3
[1:27:06] go to verse 8
[1:27:08] and they heard the voice
[1:27:11] they heard what
[1:27:13] they heard water
[1:27:15] the way
[1:27:16] our pentecostal understanding is
[1:27:21] everybody okay
[1:27:23] when they say they heard the voice
[1:27:26] you will think they were hearing
[1:27:34] let's read the bible let's the bible
[1:27:36] talk
[1:27:37] the bible says are you there
[1:27:40] genesis 3 verse 8 are you there
[1:27:43] the bible say and they heard they heard
[1:27:46] what
[1:27:47] the voiceover
[1:27:49] the voice of the lord god doing what
[1:27:53] stop
[1:27:55] have you seen my voice walking
[1:27:58] [Music]
[1:28:00] i'm reading your bible have you seen a
[1:28:03] voice
[1:28:04] like when i'm saying jesus so you see
[1:28:06] that voice working
[1:28:09] what is he saying
[1:28:12] what does he mean
[1:28:15] amen so it's not really the voice

[1:33:19] a great water
[1:33:20] answer for what so what john heard was a
[1:33:24] voice
[1:33:27] did they say he hear somebody there
[1:33:30] let's see
[1:33:32] a voice saying
[1:33:34] i am alpha and water
[1:33:37] the first and the last
[1:33:39] what you see write to the book and send
[1:33:42] it to the seven church ages which are in
[1:33:44] asia
[1:33:45] and ephesus to ephesus and to smyrna and

[1:33:50] and to philadelphia and to laodicea you
[1:33:54] ready
[1:33:55] watch verse 12
[1:33:57] and i turn to sea water
[1:34:00] how can you see a voice
[1:34:04] how can you see a vote if i say jesus do
[1:34:07] you see anything
[1:34:09] but john said that he turned to see what
[1:34:16] and when he turned to see the voice what
[1:34:18] did he see
[1:34:20] when he turned to see the voice that
[1:34:23] spoke with me
[1:34:24] and being turned i saw what
[1:34:28] and in the midst of the seven golden
[1:34:31] candlestick lie come to the water
[1:34:34] so the verse was a person
[1:34:44] brother said revelation 1 12 he says and
[1:34:48] i turn to see the voice that spec with
[1:34:50] me
[1:34:51] and bring turn i saw seven golden
[1:34:54] candlestick
[1:34:55] john does not say that he turned to see
[1:34:59] the one whose voice he heard
[1:35:04] but he turned to see the water
[1:35:07] oh i like that why do you like it
[1:35:10] brother branham
[1:35:11] because he turned to see the water
[1:35:14] and the voice and the person are warning
[1:35:18] the water
[1:35:19] jesus is there
[1:35:21] in the beginning was the
[1:35:24] and the word was with
[1:35:26] and the word was what
[1:35:28] the same was in the beginning with god
[1:35:30] all things were made by him without him
[1:35:33] was not any things made that was made if
[1:35:36] you can ever get to really see the world
[1:35:39] you will be seeing her
[1:35:41] because jesus and his word are water
[1:35:44] the messenger and his message are water
[1:35:47] the voice and the personal water
[1:35:50] this church
[1:35:54] [Laughter]
[1:35:56] everybody okay so far everybody okay so
[1:35:59] far and then when that voice came up
[1:36:03] that voice was not the bridegroom
[1:36:07] he was the introducer of the brother he
[1:36:10] was the messenger to the brother he was
[1:36:13] the one that forerunned
[1:36:17] the forerunner of the bridegroom
[1:36:20] the pointer of the bridegroom the
[1:36:23] billboard
[1:36:24] of the bridegroom the absolute voice
[1:36:27] that will indicate you where the broad
[1:36:30] room is
[1:36:33] he was not true messenger
[1:36:35] he was not two voices it was only one
[1:36:38] voice
[1:36:40] and then one broad game
[1:36:46] everybody okay and after that voice was
[1:36:49] delivered
[1:36:50] the were generals and began to trim
[1:36:53] their lamb and for some reason that
[1:36:55] voice got quiet
[1:37:01] everybody okay
[1:37:03] because in verse 10 the bible said when
[1:37:05] they went to buy the water
[1:37:08] and they they were ready to eat water
[1:37:11] do you see the voice again talking
[1:37:14] why the voice got quiet
[1:37:16] glory to god brother branham said notice
[1:37:20] john immediately said i must
[1:37:24] i must
[1:37:26] he must water
[1:37:27] i must do what
[1:37:29] he presented the church to whom
[1:37:33] amen
[1:37:36] we are told that in the last day that
[1:37:39] will do what
[1:37:44] there is going to be air
[1:37:47] coming off
[1:37:48] that will introduce them
[1:37:51] to the water
[1:37:52] it will be in such a way they shall
[1:37:55] stand down funding
[1:37:58] like they did then
[1:38:00] he promises the next chapter of matthew
[1:38:03] on malachi tells us about it so as soon
[1:38:06] as the voice introduced the blood group
[1:38:09] the voice decreases
[1:38:12] and the bridegroom does water
[1:38:16] [Music]
[1:38:21] the bible says in the book of john
[1:38:23] let's look at this increase and decrease
[1:38:26] the bible says in the book of john that
[1:38:29] hear yourself
[1:38:30] bear witness everybody here
[1:38:33] dada said i am not what
[1:38:36] because there is a difference between
[1:38:38] the introducer
[1:38:40] and the bridegroom he said i am not the
[1:38:44] cross but i am saint water
[1:38:48] so the man that was in the midnight cry
[1:38:52] was sent before jesus christ
[1:38:56] [Music]
[1:38:58] everybody okay
[1:39:00] he
[1:39:01] that has the bread
[1:39:03] is the who
[1:39:04] the bread belongs to the husband
[1:39:09] not the
[1:39:10] messenger but the friend
[1:39:14] of the who
[1:39:15] so the announcer is a friend to the
[1:39:18] bridegroom
[1:39:20] [Music]
[1:39:22] but here he's a friend to the bathroom
[1:39:27] [Music]
[1:39:30] do you keep secret to your friend
[1:39:32] to a true friend do you keep secret
[1:39:36] you tell him everything so if he is
[1:39:38] friend with the bridegroom if you want
[1:39:40] to know the secret of the bridegroom
[1:39:42] who will tell you the secret of the
[1:39:44] bathroom
[1:39:47] who will tell you what the bridegroom
[1:39:48] likes
[1:39:50] who will tell you what he want to eat
[1:39:52] he will tell you how he wants you to
[1:39:54] dress
[1:39:56] how he wants you to walk
[1:39:58] what kind of shoes you need to wear
[1:40:01] what kind of haircut you need to have
[1:40:04] you need to be connected to the friend
[1:40:07] of the bridegroom
[1:40:09] because he knows the blood groomer
[1:40:12] we talk to the bridegroom all the time
[1:40:15] [Music]
[1:40:21] glory to god
[1:40:22] what obama the bible said but the friend
[1:40:25] of the brother which standeth and he
[1:40:28] with you
[1:40:30] rejoices greatly because of the
[1:40:33] bridegroom water
[1:40:35] [Music]
[1:40:37] this is my joy therefore is what
[1:40:41] he master
[1:40:43] by the master
[1:40:45] he that come forth from water
[1:40:51] let me continue he that cometh from
[1:40:54] above is above all
[1:40:56] he that is of the earth is what
[1:41:00] so there is two people
[1:41:02] john is saying we are two
[1:41:05] one came from above
[1:41:09] and another one came from the earth
[1:41:13] amen
[1:41:14] in other words we are two messengers
[1:41:17] two people
[1:41:19] one is heavenly
[1:41:23] and another one is
[1:41:27] we okay
[1:41:28] the bible says he that is of the earth
[1:41:31] is what
[1:41:33] and speaketh of the water but he that
[1:41:35] cometh from heaven is above
[1:41:38] so we found out that when john spoke
[1:41:41] about him decreasing and crushed
[1:41:45] increasing
[1:41:46] john open up and say we are two
[1:41:50] one of us was born from the earth
[1:41:54] and another one came from heaven
[1:41:57] when you see a combination of above
[1:42:01] of someone from heaven
[1:42:03] and someone from the earth when they
[1:42:05] join together one must decrease
[1:42:11] when divorced when the introducer of the
[1:42:15] messenger and the bridegroom meet
[1:42:17] together one must decrease
[1:42:20] [Music]
[1:42:22] but the owner of the bride is not the
[1:42:25] messenger it is the bread room so the
[1:42:28] bread room which is christmas water
[1:42:32] and the other one must water
[1:42:34] [Music]
[1:42:37] what are you trying to say brother
[1:42:38] stephen brother branham said notice
[1:42:41] malachi
[1:42:43] revelation what
[1:42:44] the what
[1:42:48] didn't the bible say now watch
[1:42:50] there was an angel in revelation 10 a
[1:42:54] messenger from he came with a book
[1:42:58] put his foot on the sea foot on the quad
[1:43:01] on the on the land and did what and roll
[1:43:04] with the thunders yes
[1:43:06] amen there was a messenger from above
[1:43:09] and enough free water
[1:43:12] so revelation 10 has two messengers
[1:43:15] we have a messenger that comes from
[1:43:18] above there was a mighty engine coming
[1:43:20] down with an open book and that angel
[1:43:23] was who
[1:43:25] and there was also an earthly messenger
[1:43:28] at their voice over there
[1:43:34] amen
[1:43:36] brother bottom say there was an angel a
[1:43:38] messenger from above and an earthly
[1:43:40] messenger and each messenger was for the
[1:43:43] age of the church
[1:43:45] brother bonham said in the days speaking
[1:43:48] now there came a ninja a messenger the
[1:43:51] word english meaning english word means
[1:43:53] a messenger he came down from heaven and
[1:43:57] he put his foot on the land and the sea
[1:44:00] and saw by him that lived forever that
[1:44:03] time shall be no more is that right a
[1:44:06] rainbow around his head and all these
[1:44:08] things just taking place that angel was
[1:44:11] who
[1:44:12] certainly but what did he say but in the
[1:44:16] days of the water
[1:44:19] so we have a heavenly angel a heavenly
[1:44:22] messenger
[1:44:24] he that is heavenly is above all
[1:44:27] but he that is from the earth is water
[1:44:30] earthly if there is of the seven angel
[1:44:34] which is the seventh the seventh church
[1:44:37] age
[1:44:38] what are you trying to say
[1:44:40] amen
[1:44:42] brother bonham say
[1:44:44] there is a messenger above always
[1:44:49] and a messenger on the water
[1:44:51] the english word angel means messenger
[1:44:54] and in the seventh angel message
[1:44:58] while he was making his proclamation
[1:45:01] revelation 10 his ministry then when he
[1:45:05] began to we begin to send forth his
[1:45:07] ministry not when he started out you
[1:45:10] remember that on sunday when he started
[1:45:13] out he was senior under the priesthood
[1:45:16] but he was not expressing the prophetic
[1:45:19] gift yet
[1:45:20] because malachi 4 have to come with the
[1:45:23] midnight cry
[1:45:27] everybody okay
[1:45:29] in the message the water
[1:45:32] brother branham says this
[1:45:34] maybe this ministry
[1:45:36] that i have
[1:45:38] tried to take people back to the world
[1:45:41] has laid out
[1:45:43] and if he has i will be leaving you
[1:45:48] for what
[1:45:49] they won't be
[1:45:52] at the same time see if it is he shall
[1:45:56] be an
[1:45:58] [Music]
[1:46:00] why did he spoke that on the servant's
[1:46:02] show
[1:46:06] why did he spoke that on the seventh
[1:46:08] year because the bridegroom came
[1:46:12] [Music]
[1:46:15] because the bridegroom came
[1:46:18] that's why they took the picture and
[1:46:20] it's the head of jesus christ
[1:46:23] the bridegroom came he's right there i
[1:46:27] must decrease and the message must be
[1:46:31] water
[1:46:32] [Music]
[1:46:39] glory to god
[1:46:41] glory to god
[1:46:43] everybody clear
[1:46:45] everybody care and if you notice
[1:46:49] are we okay
[1:46:52] if it's sunday make sure you go to bed
[1:46:55] on time
[1:46:57] okay
[1:46:58] don't be staying till two o'clock like
[1:47:00] me
[1:47:01] i went to bed around four and i'm
[1:47:03] preaching
[1:47:04] okay so don't be having your fellowship
[1:47:07] till two o'clock
[1:47:09] stop your telephone go to sleep so you
[1:47:11] don't sleep in the church
[1:47:15] everybody okay
[1:47:16] glory to god if you notice in verse 10
[1:47:20] the bible while the bridegroom went to
[1:47:22] buy or while they went to buy the
[1:47:25] foolish virgin the bridegroom came
[1:47:28] and did they were working
[1:47:30] went into him with water
[1:47:32] to be ready we found out that you must
[1:47:35] have the second oil
[1:47:38] [Music]
[1:47:39] because he was the second one that made
[1:47:42] the wise virgin ready
[1:47:46] everybody here if you didn't have the
[1:47:48] second oil you need to go out and find
[1:47:51] some oil but when you come out that oil
[1:47:54] is not valid
[1:47:56] even if you find it it won't work
[1:47:58] anymore because they came back
[1:48:01] and the lord could not open the door
[1:48:03] everybody here so the second oil is the
[1:48:07] oil that make you ready
[1:48:10] ready what ready to meet the bridegroom
[1:48:14] [Music]
[1:48:21] if meeting the blood group
[1:48:25] and going in the marriage
[1:48:28] means the rapture
[1:48:32] which it means
[1:48:33] which it is
[1:48:34] amen
[1:48:35] so this oil
[1:48:38] are we okay
[1:48:39] royal
[1:48:40] provides you rapturing faith
[1:48:45] [Music]
[1:48:50] it's an oil of wisdom
[1:48:53] and we found out that the wisdom of god
[1:48:56] was through christ
[1:48:59] and the angel that came down was woo
[1:49:03] and the angel releases the thunders
[1:49:07] [Music]
[1:49:09] and the thunder was sealed under the
[1:49:12] seventh field
[1:49:14] everybody here
[1:49:16] so to be ready
[1:49:17] you must have rapturing faith
[1:49:22] [Music]
[1:49:25] brother branham said i have three pools
[1:49:28] he said the first pool was healing you
[1:49:30] remember the coat the second pool was
[1:49:33] water
[1:49:34] discernment and the third pool was the
[1:49:36] opening of the world they're breaking
[1:49:39] off their seals so the third blow
[1:49:43] brother branham said he opened the word
[1:49:46] it was the breaking of the seals
[1:49:48] and when they broke the seal what came
[1:49:51] out of the seal
[1:49:57] [Music]

[1:55:32] was in water
[1:55:34] for this seas this has to be water
[1:55:38] rapturing faith is not a game
[1:55:41] it takes a higher faith
[1:55:43] a higher anointing
[1:55:46] a higher oil
[1:55:48] a higher surge of the holy ghost
[1:55:50] a third cool anointing
[1:55:54] glory to god
[1:55:58] you praying with the seals

[1:56:27] for as certain as the first was water
[1:56:30] the first pool so here's the water
[1:56:34] and if you shall think real closely
[1:56:37] you who are water

[1:57:16] he that has wisdom
[1:57:19] that bird is properly water
[1:57:22] we know where it is so the third pool is
[1:57:25] water
[1:57:30] and the third pool was the water
[1:57:34] opening water
[1:57:41] that i must not say much about them as
[1:57:43] he told me in the beginning say nothing
[1:57:46] of it he speak for itself
[1:57:50] i have tried to explain the other i made
[1:57:52] a mistake
[1:57:53] this will be the things that do my work
[1:57:58] i don't say the lord tell me this
[1:58:01] are you afraid of that
[1:58:03] paul say in the bible this is not god
[1:58:07] this is me paul
[1:58:08] it's written in the bible but paul the
[1:58:11] bible says that every scripture is
[1:58:15] inspired
[1:58:16] even what paul said that it was him in
[1:58:20] this bible is his prayer
[1:58:30] this will be
[1:58:31] this will be a thing what the third pro
[1:58:35] that will start what
[1:58:38] for the water
[1:58:40] it's a different anointing my friend
[1:58:43] it's an anointing that breaks the world
[1:58:47] he breaks the seals and he releases the
[1:58:50] tandems

[2:00:26] not going
[2:00:28] by what
[2:00:29] we are right at the edge now
[2:00:32] it can be
[2:00:34] can't go any water
[2:00:36] we have to wait just a minute until this
[2:00:39] happened over
[2:00:40] to do it
[2:00:41] then it comes
[2:00:43] and it will be it is water
[2:00:46] what do we have to wait
[2:00:50] wait for what
[2:00:52] there is coming a time
[2:00:54] upon
[2:00:56] in this
[2:00:57] america to where this nation

[2:01:20] year is connected to the beast
[2:01:23] everybody okay the beast head before him
[2:01:26] which was water
[2:01:27] when he becomes water
[2:01:30] that this nation will do that
[2:01:33] you need a third pool
[2:01:34] the third pool break the seals the seals
[2:01:37] release water
[2:01:39] if the third pool gives rapturing
[2:01:41] faithful so the seals give was burning
[2:01:44] faith and the thunder give rupturing
[2:01:46] faith because all of them are water
[2:01:49] that's why brother branham said there is
[2:01:51] coming forth water
[2:01:54] that is not even
[2:01:57] because they were sealed everybody care
[2:02:00] that's right i believe that through
[2:02:02] those waters

[2:02:07] in order to get the bread together for
[2:02:09] what
[2:02:15] rapturing fair is in the seventh hundred

[2:09:16] subtility amen
[2:09:19] we took the example of a serpent
[2:09:22] and the serpent used was a masculine a
[2:09:25] male serpent
[2:09:26] then we talk about amnon on wednesday
[2:09:30] and amnon was still a man
[2:09:32] amen so we dealt with a male version

[2:18:56] stop let's go to revelation 17.
[2:19:00] [Music]
[2:19:04] i'm gonna go quickly here i didn't
[2:19:05] intend to get this
[2:19:07] but i'm going to stabilize somebody
[2:19:10] everybody here
[2:19:12] you there
[2:19:15] i will get to this detail down the road
[2:19:17] but let's just scratch the surface verse
[2:19:19] one and there came one of the seven
[2:19:22] angel which have the seven vowel you
[2:19:24] know this angel we went to the hotel
[2:19:26] and talked with me saying to him come
[2:19:29] here i will show you the
[2:19:32] of the great water
[2:19:35] that sits upon many water
[2:19:37] we will get to that later
[2:19:39] job two verse
[2:19:40] five everybody here
[2:19:43] and upon
[2:19:45] you
[2:19:46] there
[2:19:48] and upon her forehead was a name written
[2:19:52] mystery water
[2:19:53] the water
[2:19:54] the mother of water
[2:19:56] an abomination of the water
[2:19:59] and i saw the woman drunken with the
[2:20:02] blood of the water a killer
[2:20:07] her heart
[2:20:09] is a heart
[2:20:10] a sadder heart and the beast in the
[2:20:13] garden of eden
[2:20:15] was a sadder
[2:20:17] more sadder
[2:20:19] than anybody subtlety
[2:20:22] in the beast subtility
[2:20:25] in ammon sanctility in the lord jesus
[2:20:30] in this harlot
[2:20:32] connected with sex
[2:20:35] connected with sex
[2:20:38] [Music]
[2:20:40] we okay now
[2:20:42] who is the seed of the wicked one
[2:20:46] let's get there
[2:20:47] we know that there are two adam
[2:20:51] one is from
[2:20:52] heaven
[2:20:53] and another one from the earth and the
[2:20:56] bible said the earthly is the one that
[2:20:58] comes first
[2:20:59] that's why all messengers are born first
[2:21:02] that's why brother branham has to be
[2:21:03] born first then christ come later
[2:21:06] everybody okay it's a principle of the
[2:21:08] scripture we understand that
[2:21:11] now brother branham says follow
[2:21:13] carefully now the serpent was more
[2:21:16] subtle than any beast which the lord has
[2:21:18] in the field but obama said this beast
[2:21:21] was so close to a human being
[2:21:24] and yet was pure animal we went through
[2:21:27] this
[2:21:28] that he could reason and do what
[2:21:30] the only animal that can talk without
[2:21:32] the permission of god
[2:21:34] different than the uh
[2:21:36] the
[2:21:37] the donkey of uh of berlin
[2:21:40] he was an upright creature he was
[2:21:43] somehow
[2:21:44] somewhat in between the chimpanzee and a
[2:21:47] man but closer to a man he was so close
[2:21:50] to human being that his seed
[2:21:53] could and did what mingle with that of
[2:21:56] the woman and cause her to the water
[2:21:59] where do you think the devil would go
[2:22:02] amen
[2:22:03] he was the more sadder the more saddle
[2:22:07] mushroomed
[2:22:08] cunning
[2:22:09] wisdom
[2:22:11] everybody okay smaller than any than the
[2:22:14] animal he was right next to who
[2:22:17] remember he was a vice president
[2:22:20] the most sadly of all beasts of the
[2:22:22] field and now you say
[2:22:24] satan could not have been the serp the
[2:22:26] serpent
[2:22:28] if you shall go with me now over to
[2:22:30] second
[2:22:32] corinthians chapter 11 verse 14 the
[2:22:34] bible says that he transformed himself
[2:22:37] we read it into an angel of water
[2:22:40] you just underestimate satan
[2:22:43] [Music]
[2:22:44] yes sir he made himself into an angel of
[2:22:48] light if he could come in that kind of
[2:22:51] substance which is the angel
[2:22:53] then why couldn't he come into a beast
[2:22:57] next things to men
[2:23:01] that's why we demonstrated on wednesday
[2:23:04] that now the bible said in revelation 12
[2:23:07] that the great dragon was cast down that
[2:23:10] old
[2:23:12] not the new serpent
[2:23:15] according to the bible
[2:23:17] the old serpent
[2:23:19] follow me carefully
[2:23:21] the old serpent why does john have to
[2:23:25] say old serpent
[2:23:27] because the new serpent doesn't talk
[2:23:31] [Music]
[2:23:33] the new serpent doesn't look like a man
[2:23:37] the new serpent doesn't walk
[2:23:40] upright he crawls on the floor
[2:23:43] so john if he said the serpent it will
[2:23:46] cause confusion john said the old
[2:23:49] serpent
[2:23:50] because the odd doesn't exist anymore we
[2:23:53] have a new serpent
[2:23:56] a new version
[2:23:57] the odd is telling you go back at the
[2:24:01] beginning before the curse the serpent
[2:24:04] that serpent that was talking that
[2:24:07] serpent that was walking that serpent
[2:24:10] that was closer to god uh closer to adam
[2:24:14] that serpent that only was different
[2:24:17] from adam by the soul
[2:24:19] that serpent was the devil
[2:24:22] [Music]
[2:24:24] and water
[2:24:30] we know that the devil
[2:24:32] was the tree of life
[2:24:35] and we know that the serpent was a beast
[2:24:38] the serpent was a
[2:24:40] beast the devil was the tree
[2:24:44] i'm sorry of knowledge
[2:24:46] of good and what
[2:24:48] amen
[2:24:50] how can the tree be a serpent
[2:24:54] everybody here the serpent brother
[2:24:57] bottom say that the serpent
[2:25:00] are certain enter into the serpent
[2:25:04] how do you
[2:25:08] [Music]
[2:25:09] everybody know
[2:25:10] another word what john is saying john
[2:25:13] said that battle serpent
[2:25:15] called the water
[2:25:17] he didn't have a name first
[2:25:20] he was just serpent
[2:25:22] that's how adam call him but when the
[2:25:25] devil enter into him
[2:25:28] you can call the serpent now the devil
[2:25:32] in other words the devil was made flesh
[2:25:36] in the serpent when the devil entered
[2:25:40] the serpent the serpent becomes the
[2:25:43] devil
[2:25:46] everybody okay
[2:25:46] [Music]
[2:25:49] how do you know it's the devil remember
[2:25:52] the name can change
[2:25:54] the bible saying in genesis 3 that the
[2:25:57] serpent
[2:25:59] did he say the devil
[2:26:01] did he say the devil he says the who
[2:26:04] but you say that but john said the
[2:26:06] serpent was the devil
[2:26:10] but they didn't say the devil
[2:26:13] the serpent said to the woman ye shall
[2:26:16] not surely water
[2:26:18] the serpent said to the woman you shall
[2:26:21] not surely what
[2:26:23] god said you shall surely what
[2:26:26] in other words the serpent
[2:26:29] for the first time
[2:26:32] since his creation contradicted
[2:26:35] god
[2:26:39] god created him he was in the garden of
[2:26:43] eden all along he never do any harm for
[2:26:46] some reason we found out that when the
[2:26:48] serpent came and began to talk to eve
[2:26:51] eve repeated to the serpent
[2:26:54] the gospel of god and the serpent
[2:26:57] contradicted god for the first time
[2:27:02] he says he will surely not die in other
[2:27:06] words
[2:27:08] god say
[2:27:09] you will surely die
[2:27:11] the serpent say you will not surely die
[2:27:14] in other words the serpent is making god
[2:27:18] a liar
[2:27:20] [Music]
[2:27:24] everybody here
[2:27:25] when you make god the liar
[2:27:28] the serpent is destroying the character
[2:27:32] of god
[2:27:34] in front of his children
[2:27:39] everybody here
[2:27:41] when you destroy a character of a man
[2:27:45] in front of his children you are
[2:27:47] actually killing the man
[2:27:52] you are committing murder
[2:27:54] [Music]
[2:27:57] are we okay
[2:27:59] so when the devil said you shall not
[2:28:02] surely die he was committing murder
[2:28:05] against god
[2:28:07] and he was also lying
[2:28:14] the bible says in john chapter 8 verse
[2:28:17] 44
[2:28:18] ye are your father the who
[2:28:21] and the last of your father he won
[2:28:24] he was a water from water
[2:28:32] who was speaking on the in the devil
[2:28:34] in the serpent
[2:28:38] he was a murderer from water
[2:28:40] in the beginning he says god is a liar
[2:28:45] and a boat not in the water
[2:28:48] because in heaven lucifer could not stay
[2:28:51] true to god
[2:28:52] when he comes in the earth is he going
[2:28:54] to stay true to the word of god so it's
[2:28:57] not the serpent the beast it is who was
[2:28:59] inside the serpent everybody okay
[2:29:02] because there is no truth in him
[2:29:05] when he speaketh he speak with water
[2:29:07] [Music]
[2:29:09] he shall not surely die was that the
[2:29:11] truth
[2:29:12] he was water
[2:29:14] if this statement shows murder and shows
[2:29:18] lie because he's speaking from his own
[2:29:20] he said and the father
[2:29:23] who do you think was in the serpent
[2:29:26] who was in the serpent
[2:29:28] [Music]
[2:29:30] open genesis 4.
[2:29:36] going to run quickly
[2:29:37] lord help me
[2:29:39] open genesis 4.
[2:29:42] everybody okay
[2:29:45] oh they help me
[2:29:48] you open genesis 4
[2:29:51] if you dare you can say amen
[2:29:54] go to verse 4
[2:29:56] you there
[2:29:57] and able he also brought forth the first
[2:30:00] lane of his flock and of the fat thereof
[2:30:03] and the lord had respect to abel and to
[2:30:05] his offering brother abel
[2:30:08] but
[2:30:09] to cain
[2:30:10] and his offering he had no water
[2:30:13] and ken was very angry
[2:30:15] and his countenance fell
[2:30:17] and the lord said to cain why are you
[2:30:19] angry and why is your countenance
[2:30:21] falling if you do well shall you not be
[2:30:24] accepted
[2:30:25] and if you do not well sin lies
[2:30:28] at the door
[2:30:29] the door of cain
[2:30:31] sin is already there and to you shall
[2:30:34] his desire
[2:30:35] and you shall rule over him
[2:30:38] and can talk with abel his brother and
[2:30:41] he came to pass when they were in the
[2:30:44] field that cain rose up against evil and
[2:30:47] deed water
[2:30:50] he committed water
[2:30:52] the devil
[2:30:53] does two things
[2:30:55] he's a murderer and he's a liar
[2:30:59] ken committed murder let's see if cain
[2:31:02] lied
[2:31:05] we okay
[2:31:07] job two verse nine and the lord said to
[2:31:09] cain
[2:31:10] where is evil your brother and he said i
[2:31:13] know
[2:31:14] he didn't know where ever was
[2:31:20] everybody okay so ken did two things
[2:31:24] murder and what
[2:31:25] the devil did two things murder and
[2:31:28] water
[2:31:29] where is cane coming from hold on
[2:31:32] [Music]
[2:31:33] hold on let's keep moving
[2:31:35] everybody okay
[2:31:36] everybody okay
[2:31:38] now the bible says he that committed sin
[2:31:41] is off the water
[2:31:43] for the devil sinneth from the water
[2:31:46] but we see that the one who sinned in
[2:31:48] the beginning was the serpent
[2:31:50] but john is saying he was not the
[2:31:52] serpent he was there
[2:31:53] that's why the old serpent was the devil
[2:31:56] and
[2:31:57] satan the devil sings from the beginning
[2:32:00] for this purpose the son of god was
[2:32:03] manifested that he might destroy the
[2:32:04] work of water so the one that was
[2:32:07] talking in the serpent was not the
[2:32:09] serpent
[2:32:10] it was their devil
[2:32:13] another example
[2:32:15] in matthew 16
[2:32:17] when jesus began when
[2:32:19] from that time forth began jesus to show
[2:32:22] unto his disciple had that he must go on
[2:32:25] to jerusalem and suffer many things to
[2:32:27] the elder and the chief priest and
[2:32:29] scribe and be killed and be raised again
[2:32:32] there third day jesus is talking
[2:32:35] we okay
[2:32:36] then peter took him
[2:32:39] and begin to do what
[2:32:42] who was rebuking jesus
[2:32:44] if i ask you who's rebuking jesus you
[2:32:46] will say who
[2:32:47] who do you see doing that
[2:32:50] saying fabidi
[2:32:53] this shall not be unto thee but he
[2:32:56] turned and say unto you
[2:32:59] get deep behind me peter
[2:33:05] [Music]
[2:33:10] so who was talking in peter
[2:33:12] who was talking in the serpent
[2:33:14] that's why jesus told peter that satan
[2:33:17] have searched for you
[2:33:19] so long
[2:33:21] but because of predestination
[2:33:24] because you are predestinated sin
[2:33:26] i have prayed for you
[2:33:29] [Music]
[2:33:31] that your faith does water
[2:33:33] that's why the brother don't understand
[2:33:36] you
[2:33:37] you going through crisis in your life
[2:33:39] we put you down he thinks that you
[2:33:42] already messed up and suddenly you're
[2:33:44] coming back to god
[2:33:46] you go down you come back to god you got
[2:33:48] done he come back to god he even make
[2:33:51] you backstreet
[2:33:52] we say i got him finished but for some
[2:33:55] reason
[2:33:56] you come back again to church
[2:33:59] it is not you
[2:34:00] somebody prayed for you
[2:34:03] you got covered
[2:34:05] he cannot do anything
[2:34:08] [Music]
[2:34:12] hallelujah
[2:34:13] that's why you run you come back you run
[2:34:15] you come back you run you come back you
[2:34:17] need to stop and say wait a minute i ran
[2:34:19] three times i came back i am not a child
[2:34:22] of the devil
[2:34:23] i am a child of the king
[2:34:25] [Applause]
[2:34:27] because the devil when he was cursed
[2:34:31] he never
[2:34:32] was redeemed back

[2:35:55] area
[2:35:56] he affected her sight
[2:35:58] he affected her desire
[2:36:01] and he also wanted her to have a wisdom
[2:36:04] higher than the wisdom of god
[2:36:06] brother branham says this
[2:36:09] lord help me he said in matthew 4
[2:36:12] wherein jesus is tempted of the devil he
[2:36:14] overcome the personal temptation of
[2:36:17] satan by water
[2:36:18] and by the word
[2:36:20] in each of the three waters
[2:36:24] that corresponded exactly to the
[2:36:27] temptation of the garden of what
[2:36:30] everybody okay
[2:36:32] everybody okay
[2:36:33] the water
[2:36:37] [Music]
[2:36:39] the eyes were pleasant and the pride of
[2:36:42] water you want to wish them more than
[2:36:44] god
[2:36:47] [Music]
[2:36:51] if you find somebody's telling you
[2:36:54] something
[2:36:56] and after you talk to that person it
[2:36:58] begin to bring a wrong desire in you
[2:37:06] let me continue
[2:37:08] brother branham say he's 40 days of
[2:37:10] temptation by god's word he overcame i
[2:37:14] want to express something here just a
[2:37:15] few minutes satan made premature water
[2:37:19] upon him in there
[2:37:22] it's always in them
[2:37:24] don't forget it he made three major
[2:37:26] water
[2:37:27] from there
[2:37:28] through the water he tried his best to
[2:37:31] conquer him but he was the
[2:37:34] what did he use himself the word satan's
[2:37:38] three major attacks or assault upon him
[2:37:41] but he met him with what
[2:37:43] every attack he could make with the
[2:37:45] water if eve would have stuck with the
[2:37:48] world
[2:37:51] that's all you have to do
[2:37:53] she would have handed a serpent let me
[2:37:56] move on quickly that's why the bible say
[2:37:58] love not the water
[2:38:00] neither the things of the
[2:38:02] lust of the eyes
[2:38:04] desire if any man loves the world the
[2:38:07] love of the father is not even what
[2:38:09] and all that is in the
[2:38:12] the entire kingdom of satan
[2:38:14] is only in three part the last of the
[2:38:18] water
[2:38:18] the last of the water the plot of water
[2:38:22] is not of the water but is of the water
[2:38:25] this wisdom descended not from heaven
[2:38:28] that wisdom there
[2:38:30] but it's earth
[2:38:32] and it's water and it's water
[2:38:34] essential is connected to sex
[2:38:38] it's a wisdom that is connected to
[2:38:41] sexual desire
[2:38:44] it's a wisdom from the devil
[2:38:46] you say sex brother stephen no problem
[2:38:50] you say sex brother stephen no problem
[2:38:52] let me go this way
[2:38:54] eve says this
[2:38:57] that
[2:38:58] the woman say unto the serpent we may
[2:39:01] eat
[2:39:02] of the fruit of the tree of the god
[2:39:05] but of the fruit of the tree which is in
[2:39:07] the midst of the garden god has said you
[2:39:09] shall not
[2:39:11] remember this
[2:39:12] and what
[2:39:15] what is eating
[2:39:17] in first corinthians chapter 7
[2:39:20] verse 1 the bible says
[2:39:23] now concerning the things whereof you
[2:39:26] wrote unto me
[2:39:28] we okay
[2:39:29] we okay
[2:39:30] it is good for a man
[2:39:33] not to water
[2:39:35] catch a water
[2:39:37] what kind of touch is that
[2:39:40] touching like this
[2:39:45] nevertheless to avoid water
[2:39:48] the touch is fornication it's
[2:39:57] why did he curse her conception
[2:40:00] amen
[2:40:01] if to avoid fornication let every man
[2:40:04] has his own and let every woman have her
[2:40:07] own
[2:40:08] so this touch is a sexual act
[2:40:16] check
[2:40:17] what about eating
[2:40:21] you ready
[2:40:22] devil really
[2:40:26] all right in the sound of solomon
[2:40:30] the bible say a garden in clothes is my
[2:40:33] water
[2:40:34] so a woman is a garden
[2:40:36] [Music]
[2:40:41] am i reading a different bible
[2:40:43] a woman is a field
[2:40:46] [Music]
[2:40:48] a garden that isn't close

[2:40:53] my spouse a spring that is water
[2:40:57] she's my spouse a fountain that is water
[2:41:00] she's a virgin
[2:41:03] verse 16 and why call northwind
[2:41:06] and come that's half wind
[2:41:09] blow out upon my water
[2:41:12] that my spice there of my water
[2:41:15] let my beloved come into his water
[2:41:18] and do it
[2:41:21] did you see women walking around with
[2:41:24] apples on them
[2:41:28] [Music]

[2:41:39] do you see women working with fruit
[2:41:43] cantaloupe whatever
[2:41:45] what are they heading
[2:41:48] so it means water
[2:41:50] let me help you again
[2:41:52] prophet t.b search is the way of the
[2:41:55] water
[2:41:57] an adultery is for somebody who is
[2:41:59] already married
[2:42:01] and eve was already
[2:42:03] an adulterous woman she does what
[2:42:10] it's your bible
[2:42:11] so the touching
[2:42:13] is sex
[2:42:14] the eating is water
[2:42:16] both of them are
[2:42:21] everybody okay
[2:42:22] let's see what perfect math and say i
[2:42:24] have done on what adultery that's why
[2:42:27] eve have committed adultery because it
[2:42:31] was saying eating she was a married
[2:42:33] woman and a married woman committing
[2:42:36] adultery she's eating that's why the
[2:42:38] bible say when she ate
[2:42:40] and she because she she now realized
[2:42:43] that she is naked
[2:42:45] what makes her realize naked because
[2:42:48] that eating was a sexual
[2:42:50] [Music]
[2:42:52] act everybody okay
[2:42:55] let's head quickly amen that's why the
[2:42:57] bible said adam was not deceived but the
[2:43:00] woman being water
[2:43:02] was in the water
[2:43:03] adam came later and he looked he said
[2:43:05] god is going to kill my wife
[2:43:07] let me take her sin
[2:43:10] so that when god comes he cannot destroy
[2:43:12] him he cannot destroy sarah when abraham
[2:43:15] is there he cannot destroy me when
[2:43:17] christ has come
[2:43:22] the bird groom comes there's nothing god
[2:43:24] can do if he'd show me he destroyed good
[2:43:27] question
[2:43:28] everybody okay so far
[2:43:29] amen brother branham said the devil came
[2:43:32] down and cut into the water
[2:43:34] and he found eve in the garden of eden
[2:43:37] naked and he talked about the fruit in
[2:43:39] the midst
[2:43:41] the meets the middle you understand in a
[2:43:44] mixed congregation because the woman is
[2:43:46] a gardener he said now it's pleasant
[2:43:48] it's good to the earth what did he do he
[2:43:51] began making love to eve and he lived
[2:43:54] with her and as a
[2:43:57] such is the way of an adulterous woman
[2:43:59] amen what about them says saturday
[2:44:01] morning
[2:44:04] perhaps
[2:44:05] met this evil one the serpent which was
[2:44:08] the serpent not in a raptor but a beast
[2:44:11] more suddenly cunning smart of all the
[2:44:13] beasts just under men a man is a beast
[2:44:16] himself we are warm blooded animal that

[2:44:31] wise he told her the fruit the seed the
[2:44:34] fruit was pleasant it was
[2:44:36] desirable and when he lived with her
[2:44:40] and then the afternoon she persuaded
[2:44:44] adam to do the same
[2:44:47] tell him what he wanted
[2:44:49] the timing was not far away
[2:44:52] this is what brother branham said what
[2:44:54] does the bible say about the timing
[2:44:57] the bible says in the morning do it
[2:45:01] and in the evening do what
[2:45:04] you can sow in the morning you can sow
[2:45:06] in the evening
[2:45:07] [Music]
[2:45:09] why do you need to sow twice
[2:45:13] because you don't know
[2:45:16] whether where they shall water
[2:45:18] either this or
[2:45:20] or what

[2:48:57] was a child of who
[2:49:00] ken was a child of the wicked one who is
[2:49:04] the wicked one
[2:49:07] cain
[2:49:08] was the child
[2:49:10] of the wicked one
[2:49:12] who is the wicked one
[2:49:15] amen
[2:49:16] amen
[2:49:18] cain
[2:49:19] was a child of the wicked one according
[2:49:21] to genesis 4
[2:49:23] the bible says that adam knew eve his
[2:49:26] wife and she conceived and brought who
[2:49:30] according to genesis chapter 4 the
[2:49:33] father of cain is who
[2:49:36] adam is adam a wicked one
[2:49:39] let me help you up
[2:49:41] the bible says
[2:49:43] which was of enos which was of the son
[2:49:47] of said which was the son of whom
[2:49:49] which was the son of who
[2:49:51] so adam was the son of who
[2:49:55] am i reading a different bible
[2:49:57] according to the bible adam
[2:50:00] is the son of who
[2:50:04] but cain is the son of whom
[2:50:07] but the bible say adam knew eve
[2:50:10] and he produced his cain but adam was a
[2:50:13] son of god
[2:50:18] so adam was a wicked one
[2:50:21] so who's the father of cain
[2:50:24] [Music]
[2:50:26] you ready
[2:50:28] go to uh
[2:50:29] we on genesis chapter four
[2:50:32] go to job to verse 25
[2:50:35] i'm almost finished
[2:50:37] give me a few grace you there
[2:50:40] are you there
[2:50:42] are you there
[2:50:43] somebody got are you there
[2:50:45] the bible says and adam
[2:50:48] because right here can kill evil
[2:50:52] so adam was left with one child kane
[2:50:55] okay
[2:50:56] and adam
[2:50:58] knew his wife again
[2:51:01] not the first time
[2:51:03] everybody okay the first time he
[2:51:04] produces
[2:51:05] over there
[2:51:07] adam knew his wife again and she bought
[2:51:11] a son called his name who
[2:51:15] said
[2:51:16] adam produced
[2:51:18] said
[2:51:19] but we know that
[2:51:21] adam came from god
[2:51:24] we okay now
[2:51:25] he knew
[2:51:26] and and produced it
[2:51:29] for god she said had appointed
[2:51:33] everybody okay
[2:51:35] need another water
[2:51:37] another seed instead of water
[2:51:40] whom ken did what
[2:51:42] if he's saying that because ever was
[2:51:46] killed
[2:51:47] set
[2:51:48] replaced
[2:51:52] appointed instead in the place of able
[2:51:56] god replace said so set is the
[2:52:00] replacement of able
[2:52:03] in other words set is the compensation
[2:52:06] that's what the word said to me
[2:52:08] everybody okay
[2:52:10] so now if you want to talk about the
[2:52:12] children of adam you can go straight
[2:52:14] from adam to set
[2:52:17] because set is only ever in replacement
[2:52:21] do you hear me
[2:52:23] seth and ever are the same
[2:52:26] they took stable off and they switch it
[2:52:28] with set
[2:52:30] that's why brother branham say seth and
[2:52:32] evil represent jesus christ
[2:52:35] one represent jesus christ killed at the
[2:52:37] cross and the other represent jesus
[2:52:40] christ resurrected because it's the same
[2:52:42] person they just switched them
[2:52:45] everybody okay so far everybody okay so
[2:52:47] far so we know now that ever from adam
[2:52:51] set from adam adam from god but came
[2:52:55] from the wicked but adam is now wicked
[2:52:58] who's the father of cain

[3:05:25] himself and
[3:05:28] touches him
[3:05:32] is a child of the wicked one a child of
[3:05:37] the devil
[3:05:38] that's why he does not appear
[3:05:41] in the genealogy
[3:05:43] of god
[3:05:44] what happened there was a sexual act
[3:05:47] that happened between eve and the
[3:05:50] serpent and that sexual act

[3:06:34] serpent has a seed
[3:06:37] we know clearly by the scripture that
[3:06:39] that seed is talking about cane
[3:06:43] but who is the seed of the woman
[3:06:46] and if you find the seed of the woman
[3:06:48] if that seed started from the beginning
[3:06:51] there is a seed of the woman both of
[3:06:53] them are going to fight all the way to
[3:06:56] the end
