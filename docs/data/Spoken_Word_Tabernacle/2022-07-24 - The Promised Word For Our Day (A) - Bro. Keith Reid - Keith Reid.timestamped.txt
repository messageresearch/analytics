[37:36] [Laughter]
[37:39] amen
[37:40] everybody's still meditating on the
[37:42] second oil
[37:43] you got it very well
[37:45] one title d
[37:47] two evidences
[37:48] the evidences that are open
[37:52] one open and one close
[37:53] you got that pretty good it's one sword
[37:56] but it appears to be too sword
[38:00] anybody okay
[38:02] oh my god
[38:04] you better make sure you get everything
[38:06] pretty good
[38:08] because your boss opened up the trail of
[38:10] the serpent again
[38:12] you see now
[38:16] it is not me
[38:19] i was just starting something else and
[38:21] then
[38:22] then he opened up amen
[38:25] if i get brother brother i'm saying you
[38:26] would take him four hours
[38:29] for him to preach that
[38:30] so i'm trying to touch just the surface
[38:33] and stay on where we are amen if i dig
[38:35] into it then it's going to be
[38:37] a lot of
[38:40] convention
[38:44] amen
[38:45] it took me to revelation 13 and
[38:47] revelation 17 and revelation and then i
[38:51] say my god now i see why brother branham
[38:53] said he was a beast
[38:55] and you can chase it from genesis all
[38:58] the way down
[38:59] amen
[39:01] blessed be the name of the lord
[39:03] it's amazing how the holy spirit is
[39:05] moving
[39:07] there are things that are opening up
[39:09] and you wonder i was talking to brother
[39:11] chad i said but there are things in this
[39:13] message that if you tell folks they will
[39:16] spin their head
[39:17] like where are you getting them from yet
[39:20] it's in the scripture
[39:22] and it's in the message
[39:24] he said but stephen i seen that i was
[39:26] worrying i thought i was the i hope i'm
[39:29] not the only one saying these things
[39:31] amen
[39:32] oh my god blessed be the name of the
[39:35] lord
[39:36] i was talking to my wife yesterday you
[39:38] remember on sunday
[39:40] the scripture says that the priests have
[39:42] to
[39:43] sprinkle the mercy seat eastward
[39:47] but the ark of the covenant was on the
[39:50] west
[39:51] right
[39:52] how can you be on the west sprinkling
[39:54] the mercy seat on the east
[40:01] everybody okay
[40:02] everybody okay
[40:05] no you're not okay
[40:07] i know my church everybody okay
[40:10] it's sunday
[40:12] you the one that usually starts stuff
[40:15] not me
[40:17] amen
[40:22] this is the tabernacle right
[40:24] you enter the tabernacle from there
[40:28] which was the
[40:29] gate of judah
[40:31] right
[40:32] when you enter you have the brazen altar
[40:35] everybody okay
[40:36] then you got the lever right
[40:38] then we go to the holy place right
[40:41] then in the holy place you got the
[40:43] candlestick here everybody okay
[40:46] then over there the table of the
[40:47] showbread right
[40:49] then over here the altar of the essence
[40:51] right then the ark of the covenant was
[40:54] right here
[40:55] so the ark was on the west side
[40:58] everybody okay
[40:59] on the north was here
[41:02] there were different gates but the
[41:03] tabernacle you get there here
[41:06] and then the sapphires right here
[41:08] and the bible says in leviticus 16 last
[41:11] sunday that when the priest uses his
[41:14] finger which we know the finger means
[41:16] the spirit of god
[41:17] he needs to sprinkle the mercy seat
[41:19] seven times that you sprinkle the mercy
[41:22] seat toward
[41:24] the east
[41:25] and brother branham says that the brazen
[41:28] altar was on the east
[41:29] and brother branham said that the mercy
[41:31] seat which was here on the ark was on
[41:35] the east
[41:39] if you want to start trouble with
[41:41] brother branham
[41:43] you can start right there you say no the
[41:45] scriptures say it's on the west brother
[41:47] branham say it's on the east
[41:50] you need to listen to the prophet very
[41:52] carefully
[41:54] amen
[41:55] everybody okay
[41:57] everybody good
[41:59] now how can you sprinkle the mercy seat
[42:01] toward the east
[42:03] because the mercy city is toward the
[42:05] west you need to be looking at the mercy
[42:08] seat to sprinkle it
[42:09] but if you sprinkle that way you are
[42:11] sprinkling toward the west
[42:14] let's make it easy on you
[42:17] this is the west
[42:20] okay
[42:21] this is the mercy seat
[42:23] everybody good
[42:24] and the door over there is the east
[42:27] everybody okay so if the priest come
[42:30] and he need to sprinkle the mercy seat
[42:32] toward the east
[42:34] if he does this
[42:36] the mercy seat is behind him
[42:38] so he's not really sprinkling the mercy
[42:40] seat
[42:42] everybody okay
[42:43] so the priests have to go behind
[42:48] everybody okay
[42:49] everybody okay then the priest is
[42:51] watching east
[42:53] now the mercy seat is on the east
[42:57] and the high priest is on the west
[43:02] that's the only time the mercy city is
[43:04] on the east
[43:05] anybody here so now when the high priest
[43:08] stands here he begins to sprinkle the
[43:10] mercy seed he's sprinkling the mercy
[43:12] seat eastward
[43:14] because he's behind
[43:17] the mercy seat
[43:19] everybody okay
[43:23] you good or you want me to dig a little
[43:25] b
[43:28] you're going to give this the preacher
[43:29] time right
[43:31] everybody okay
[43:32] now this mercy seat brother branham say
[43:34] he was the throne of god
[43:37] why was he the throne because there was
[43:39] a caribbean on one side a caribbean on
[43:41] the other side and the pillar of fire
[43:44] was standing right in the midst of it
[43:46] which was a reflection of heaven because
[43:49] in heaven you have a throne and the four
[43:51] beasts was around it
[43:53] everybody okay so far everybody okay so
[43:55] far so if the high priest is behind the
[43:59] mercy seat
[44:01] and the mercy seat is here
[44:03] and the mercy seat is the throne of god
[44:06] and the pillar of fire is stealing on
[44:08] the mercy seat so when you come in the
[44:11] tabernacle when you enter the holiest
[44:15] who do you see first
[44:20] can you speak a lot who do you see first
[44:23] you see the mercy seat and the pillar of
[44:24] fire do you see the high priest
[44:29] he's where
[44:30] stop
[44:32] john was in heaven
[44:37] and he saw somebody sitting under
[44:41] you now alive
[44:45] i know what is causing that
[44:48] i was communicating to her sister she
[44:50] asked me a question i say look at the
[44:52] scripture and tell me what you see
[44:55] she said brother stephen i see it's a
[44:57] she but i'm overthinking
[45:00] i say you're not overthinking you're
[45:02] just afraid
[45:04] to accept what your eyes are telling you
[45:08] because you were taught differently
[45:11] the problem you are afraid where am i
[45:13] going
[45:15] anybody okay all right when you get to
[45:17] heaven there was somebody sitting on the
[45:19] throne holding a book in his writing
[45:22] they called for the kingsman redeemer
[45:25] they say who is worthy
[45:27] to come take the book and do what break
[45:30] the seals john look in heaven did he see
[45:33] somebody
[45:37] john look a on the earth did he see
[45:39] somebody
[45:40] he looked underneath the earth did he
[45:42] see somebody but they told him they said
[45:44] the lion
[45:47] of the tribe of judah
[45:49] have prevailed to take the book and to
[45:51] do what
[45:52] so when john turned around because he
[45:55] was crying he saw what
[45:57] where was the lamb
[46:04] [Applause]
[46:05] where was the lamb
[46:11] where was the
[46:12] lamb that's why you heard under the
[46:16] seals brother branham saying that he was
[46:18] in the intercessory box
[46:21] he was working the work of redemption so
[46:24] he has to come out from there
[46:27] the lamb was on the melchizedek
[46:30] priesthood on the backside
[46:33] sprinkling the mercy seat by the seven
[46:35] messenger
[46:40] everybody here and when it's time to
[46:43] break the seal then the lamb himself
[46:45] come out
[46:52] [Applause]
[46:54] the old testament is not difficult
[46:57] with a prophet
[47:01] did you get that
[47:02] that's why john was looking he can't see
[47:04] him because the high priest is hidden
[47:06] behind
[47:10] and brother branham would never tell you
[47:12] that he just said he was in the
[47:13] intercessory box and he left
[47:15] you figure that out
[47:17] it takes the holy spirit
[47:19] the second awhile
[47:24] not the first
[47:25] it takes the second oil
[47:28] to go down
[47:29] and to pull that stuff up and to show
[47:32] you saying this is what was hidden there
[47:36] now you understand why john could not
[47:38] see him
[47:40] because he came out of heaven so he was
[47:43] somewhere in heaven where was it
[47:47] john never said he came out but branham
[47:49] said he came out from the throne but
[47:51] where was he at
[47:53] he was behind somewhere
[47:56] and when you look you see the pillar of
[47:57] fire but i and my father we are
[48:06] everybody okay
[48:07] did i lose somebody
[48:14] amen
[48:17] i kept it to preach on that now you got
[48:21] it before even the sermon
[48:24] i was thinking at home i say i have a
[48:26] hard time
[48:28] is to keep secret from you
[48:32] i don't know what you did
[48:35] i would say i'm going to keep it i'm
[48:36] going to keep it before you know it it's
[48:38] already out
[48:40] amen
[48:42] there is so much in this message
[48:45] the opening of the seals
[48:47] have opened the scripture in the way
[48:49] that you never seen before that's why
[48:53] when you heard brother branham say the
[48:54] bible became a new book brother branham
[48:58] knew what he was talking about
[49:02] everybody okay
[49:04] blessed be the name of the lord so you
[49:06] keep praying
[49:07] because we're gonna dig more
[49:09] amen
[49:11] that sister asked me a question she
[49:12] didn't know it was the holy spirit using
[49:14] her to show me something differently
[49:18] and when i saw it i said my god now i
[49:21] see what it was
[49:23] amen
[49:24] it is very difficult but it is in the
[49:27] scripture and it's in the message if i
[49:29] give you the court you will begin to
[49:31] question brother branham until i give
[49:33] you the scripture and you will see that
[49:34] brother brother most perfectly in line
[49:36] but he never gave you the scripture
[49:41] i keep it you will understand that
[49:43] better
[49:44] by and by amen

[56:00] amen to wave the banner high
[56:03] for the lord jesus christ

[56:09] certainly changed it's unusual that i
[56:12] travel without my wife
[56:13] you know and so

[56:17] had to start a business
[56:19] and now somebody's got to stay back to
[56:21] take care of things while the other is
[56:23] gone so i mean i'm here she's back there
