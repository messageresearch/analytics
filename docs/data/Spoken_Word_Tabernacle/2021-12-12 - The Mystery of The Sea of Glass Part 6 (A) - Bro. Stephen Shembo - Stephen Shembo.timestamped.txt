[44:40] on fire
[44:41] amen
[44:42] so don't get scared when people begin to
[44:44] say hey man
[44:45] [Laughter]
[44:48] at this point they're trembling
[44:50] i am not the one who put the gift in it
[44:53] i'm just trying to nurture and see where
[44:55] that is
[44:56] so we can line you up
[44:59] and prepare you and from there on your
[45:01] life is gonna change completely if it's
[45:04] vindicated it's confirmed your life
[45:07] change
[45:08] you cannot do what everybody else is
[45:10] doing
[45:12] you become a prisoner
[45:14] that's it
[45:16] you can post crazy stuff on facebook
[45:19] because brother stephen will come right
[45:21] after you
[45:21] [Music]
[45:24] your life is changed
[45:25] amen
[45:26] everything you're doing has changed
[45:29] somebody else can do it you cannot do it
[45:31] because you're standing right here
[45:33] amen so when you're standing right here
[45:35] your life must be pure
[45:39] amen because we don't want devils
[45:43] and that goes not only to the preacher
[45:45] he goes to the musician
[45:48] he goes to the church officer everybody
[45:52] must be into a certain category amen i
[45:55] would never never never lower the
[45:58] standard of the word
[46:01] to accommodate you
[46:03] amen never never either you meet the
[46:06] standard of the word
[46:08] if you feel like you cannot meet the
[46:09] standard of the word you can take a
[46:11] vacation
[46:12] in other words you can say brother
[46:14] stephen i'll argue with my wife and my
[46:17] temper is not good today i need to go
[46:19] home and ask my wife forgiveness and
[46:22] repent myself and consecrate my life and
[46:25] you clear everything good then you come
[46:27] back again and you start playing the
[46:29] instrument
[46:30] amen
[46:31] don't play the instrument when things
[46:33] are not correct
[46:34] don't sing if you know that you're not
[46:37] in line with the word
[46:39] and you're messing yourself up
[46:41] amen it's better for you to even sit to
[46:43] them to come and sing but when you sing
[46:45] you make sure everything is clean
[46:48] not in your eyes into the eyes of the
[46:50] lord amen so when you take the sin you
[46:53] confess them you put them under the
[46:55] blood then automatically regardless of
[46:58] how guilty you still feel or regardless
[47:01] of how bad things looks like you put
[47:03] your trust in the atonement
[47:06] into the sacrifice
[47:07] that's when you are feeling like now i'm
[47:10] approaching you not that i'm worthy to
[47:13] approach you but i'm singing because of
[47:15] your grace i am playing the instrument
[47:18] because of your grace i am preaching
[47:20] because of the earth because of your
[47:22] grace because the black dog is still
[47:24] fighting you amen so that goes from
[47:27] everything everybody deacon trust is
[47:30] everybody i would never lower the
[47:33] standard
[47:34] amen if the standard is 10 you are seven
[47:38] push for forward
[47:39] get to 10. if you feel like you cannot
[47:42] get to 10 you say but stephen i feel
[47:44] like i need to
[47:46] fix certain stuff in my life
[47:48] correct it and then i will get back i
[47:50] will respect you more
[47:53] amen i will respect you more
[47:56] and the people will respect you more
[47:58] because you are understanding the
[48:00] sacredness
[48:01] of the work of the lord amen i'm not
[48:04] going to play the instrument now let me
[48:06] sit down and then pray tomorrow i'm
[48:08] coming back don't sit down and go
[48:10] forever
[48:11] that's another problem because god put
[48:14] the gift you not the author of the gift
[48:17] god have a right his sovereign will to
[48:20] do what he want to do with the gift he
[48:22] placed on you so you cannot tell god
[48:25] what to do with your gift
[48:26] it is up to you to surrender to god and
[48:29] let god use it so if you are the man you
[48:32] don't stay out of the line for a long
[48:34] time because god needs you you're
[48:35] missing your spot if you don't he's
[48:37] going to tighten up things and whip you
[48:39] very hard until you understand and come
[48:42] back
[48:42] so in other words what i'm saying it
[48:45] would be quick to repent
[48:47] the bible say what branham said the zeal
[48:50] of this age is what
[48:53] is water repent you did something wrong
[48:56] repent put everything back in line and
[48:58] go back to the
[49:00] that's the just you we fell
[49:02] get back up and then we keep moving
[49:04] that's a child of god amen so don't try
[49:07] to be perfect perfect no just be you be
[49:10] christian if something is out of line
[49:11] correct and move on if you feel like
[49:14] i'm not you back up a little bit take a
[49:16] break
[49:17] prepare yourself realign and move
[49:20] forward with a faster and a stronger
[49:22] determination that i'm going to do
[49:24] better than before
[49:26] that's how christian operates
[49:28] don't worry about what people are saying
[49:30] don't worry about who is looking at you
[49:31] at the church because you're gonna get
[49:33] caught up into a trouble trying to
[49:36] please people
[49:38] amen
[49:39] don't try to please people
[49:44] let everybody say what they want to do
[49:47] as long as you know that you and god are
[49:51] in line that's it
[49:53] that's all
[49:54] that's all don't try to do something to
[49:57] please brother benjamin
[50:01] you're wasting your time
[50:03] your family will be made manifest
[50:05] don't waste your time like that always
[50:08] check yourself with the word with the
[50:10] word with the word with the word and the
[50:12] more you move you move you're going to
[50:14] get better amen
[50:16] in other words i'm shooting for
[50:18] perfection
[50:21] amen
[50:23] amen
[50:25] you want to learn my way
[50:27] it's not easy paul say that
[50:30] i tighten my body
[50:32] very hard
[50:33] amen because there is a work to do amen
[50:37] so don't be lazy if you got whipped just
[50:40] stand up and move forward it will make
[50:42] you better
[50:43] if you want to be a good saver of money
[50:46] come let me sit with you i'm going to
[50:47] tighten you pretty good
[50:49] until you feel like you're choking
[50:52] but when you check your bank account you
[50:54] will see money coming up like this
[50:56] there's two ways
[50:58] either you want to continue the way you
[50:59] want to do and keep spending spending
[51:01] spending and credit card and debt and
[51:03] all kind of stuff or you want to be help
[51:05] but they help sometime take a rough
[51:08] training
[51:10] amen if you see people in this life
[51:12] successfully go sit with them
[51:15] they're more rigid than you think
[51:17] they wake up so early than you think
[51:19] while you're still sleeping they're
[51:21] already on the stock market
[51:23] you're the one sleeping snoring they're
[51:25] already making money
[51:27] amen
[51:28] and when they sleep you are still there
[51:29] waking up
[51:31] because of lack of discipline
[51:34] amen
[51:35] so we love you it's a pastor

[54:58] and i don't know what to do i have to
[55:00] follow the leadership of the holy spirit
[55:03] sometime you might see me going off a
[55:05] little bit
[55:07] i'm trying to reach a certain point
[55:10] to
[55:11] drop to the airport
[55:13] so we're not doing this to linger
[55:17] the time is short
[55:18] we only have two services a week
[55:22] we don't even have a sunday night
[55:23] service
[55:25] so
[55:25] if we can give a lot of sacrifice
[55:29] we will try the best also not to worry
[55:32] you
[55:32] but we gotta do what we got the hour is
[55:36] late we gotta go into the rapture there
[55:38] is a lot of questions there is a lot of
[55:40] stuff and we gotta get busy amen
[55:43] so we don't intend to keep you longer
[55:45] but if you want go to bed on time on
[55:49] saturday go to sleep on time
[55:52] don't go to bed at 2 a.m and you're the
[55:55] one complaining in church because we're
[55:57] staying an hour because you didn't sleep
[55:59] well
[56:00] so go to bed stop texting at 2 am

[56:06] wake up early fresh and you're ready for
[56:08] the lord

[56:13] you will say a man one day
[56:15] [Music]
[56:19] it's a family so i got used to you let's
[56:21] go to genesis chapter 17
[56:26] so we try the best
[56:29] and when i felt checked by the holy
[56:31] spirit that you full i stop
[56:33] then you go home
[56:35] throughout the week and chew it and then
[56:37] you come back again then we move on
[56:38] again and fill it up so we're not going
[56:40] to try to wear you off but by the same
[56:43] talking we just need to balance a little
[56:45] bit especially on sunday we only have
[56:47] one service
[56:49] so at the evening if you want to go cook
[56:51] you can cook it evening if the children
[56:53] are going to school they're going to go
[56:54] to school tomorrow
[56:56] morning so you have all the time to go
[56:58] do the stuff
[56:59] amen
[57:00] but i will try my best
[57:05] i have coat but i leave it alone
[57:10] i have quote i just leave it alone
[57:13] genesis chapter 17 verse 18. if you dare
[57:16] you can say a man
[57:20] brother david is my
[57:22] voice okay
[57:24] okay is that can everybody can hear me
[57:26] okay
[57:28] yeah uh
[57:29] okay no problem
[57:31] i need to bless the devil
[57:35] verse 18 if you dare you can say amen
[57:38] and abraham said to god
[57:40] oh that ishmael
[57:43] might live before you
[57:46] in other words abraham is pleading for
[57:49] ishmael
[57:50] so we found here
[57:52] abraham is pleading for his son
[57:56] ishmael you might be seated
[58:01] and god say verse 19
[58:03] yes that's what i was looking for
[58:05] brother david thank you that's what i
[58:07] was looking for
[58:08] yet
[58:09] sounds like a bazooka now now and god
[58:12] says sarah your wife
[58:15] shall bear you a son
[58:17] indeed
[58:19] and you shall call his name isaac
[58:23] so
[58:24] abraham is pleading for ishmael because
[58:27] it's his own blood
[58:29] but god direct abraham to a different
[58:32] son
[58:33] whose name is isaac
[58:35] amen
[58:36] so now we found the second seed of
[58:38] abraham
[58:42] okay
[58:43] all right
[58:44] you've grown up now you can get it
[58:46] abram it's ishmael abraham is isaac but
[58:50] still
[58:51] the bloodline the natural line is the
[58:54] same man
[58:56] okay
[58:56] but two title
[58:58] okay cool
[59:00] sarah your wife shall bear you a son
[59:02] indeed
[59:03] and you shall call his name isaac
[59:06] and i will establish my covenant with
[59:10] him
[59:11] for an everlasting covenant and with his
[59:14] seeds
[59:16] [Music]
[59:18] everybody okay
[59:20] anybody okay
[59:22] so isaac is not the seed
[59:25] hey
[59:27] with his seed singular after him so the
[59:30] covenant is given through isaac
[59:36] but now in the isaac there is another
[59:38] seed coming up
[59:40] everybody here
[59:41] let's go to verse 20
[59:44] hallelujah and as for ishmael
[59:48] i have heard you
[59:50] behold i have blessed him
[59:53] and will make him fruitful
[59:55] and will
[59:56] multiply him exceedingly
[59:59] have princes shall he father and i will
[1:00:02] make him a great nation
[1:00:05] but outside the covenant
[1:00:07] [Music]
[1:00:08] so the blessings doesn't mean that god
[1:00:10] is with you
[1:00:12] verse
[1:00:13] but in other words regardless of
[1:00:16] everything i'm doing to ishmael
[1:00:18] but
[1:00:20] my covenant
[1:00:22] will establish with isaac
[1:00:25] which sarah shall bear to you at this
[1:00:29] set time in the next year in other words
[1:00:32] regardless of how ishmael is your son
[1:00:35] regardless of his your bloodline or
[1:00:37] whatever you claim i'm gonna bless him
[1:00:39] but
[1:00:41] my work is through isaac
[1:00:44] everybody clear
[1:00:45] let's go to genesis 25th
[1:00:51] blessed be the name of the lord
[1:00:54] genesis 26

[1:04:14] that
[1:04:15] he's not fur
[1:04:20] why
[1:04:21] he understood god told him my covenant
[1:04:24] is gonna be away
[1:04:26] that is the hair
[1:04:28] anybody
[1:04:30] abraham gave all that he had to isaac
[1:04:33] so what about the other children
[1:04:36] verse six but the sons of the concubines
[1:04:41] the bible called them concubines
[1:04:46] you see now
[1:04:48] you see now
[1:04:49] concubines polygamy polygamy okay but
[1:04:53] the sons of the conquerments
[1:04:55] which abraham had
[1:04:58] abraham gave what
[1:05:00] remember ishmael got blessed also
[1:05:04] right
[1:05:05] abraham gave them gifts
[1:05:09] but not the
[1:05:11] not the inheritance
[1:05:14] amen
[1:05:15] that's why don't be intimidated when you
[1:05:17] see outside denomination having gifts
[1:05:23] when you see them speaking in tongues
[1:05:26] when you see them prophesying
[1:05:28] that's okay god can give them gifts
[1:05:31] but the inheritance they cannot have it
[1:05:35] because the seed will not hair with the
[1:05:38] shack
[1:05:39] [Applause]
[1:05:44] god bless ishmael
[1:05:47] but they have to send ishmael away
[1:05:54] don't get intimidated you gotta know who
[1:05:57] you are
[1:05:58] verse six but the sons of the conquer
[1:06:01] man
[1:06:02] which abraham had
[1:06:05] abraham gave gift and did water
[1:06:11] i thought that was his bloodline
[1:06:14] what did they do to ishmael
[1:06:21] you see now
[1:06:24] separation
[1:06:27] not division
[1:06:29] okay and send them away from isaac his
[1:06:33] son
[1:06:38] the separation is to leave the seed to
[1:06:41] grow very well
[1:06:42] get them off amen amen because when
[1:06:46] ishmael was there he began to cause
[1:06:49] trouble to isaac
[1:06:51] and sarah saw it he said
[1:06:54] this seed need to grow up a different
[1:06:56] way get him off
[1:06:58] they got six other abraham look he
[1:07:01] learned from there he said you you go
[1:07:03] far you see the country over there go
[1:07:04] over there
[1:07:06] stay away amen
[1:07:08] but it's his seed
[1:07:09] so by blood they can tell you we are the
[1:07:12] children of abraham but they are not two
[1:07:15] children
[1:07:17] and send them away from isaac his son
[1:07:20] while he yet lived
[1:07:23] eastward
[1:07:25] to the east country everybody okay
[1:07:28] let's go to isaiah 53.
[1:07:34] so from here you can understand
[1:07:37] that
[1:07:37] when we speaks about the natural seed of
[1:07:40] abraham
[1:07:42] the heat there is category
[1:07:48] everybody okay
[1:07:49] usually when we say the natural seed of
[1:07:51] abraham we say the jews the natural seed
[1:07:54] of abraham have category amen
[1:07:57] he can be ishmael
[1:07:59] he can be isaac or he can be the
[1:08:02] children of keturah these two
[1:08:06] were thrown away
[1:08:08] only one stays because god say in isaac
[1:08:12] isaiah 53
[1:08:15] let's go to verse 6.
[1:08:17] if you dare you can say amen
[1:08:21] oh
[1:08:22] we like sheep have gone astray
[1:08:26] all of us
[1:08:27] regardless amen
[1:08:30] we have turned everyone to his own way
[1:08:34] and the lord has laid on him the
[1:08:36] iniquity of ours all
[1:08:39] so all the crazy stuff we did they took
[1:08:42] it and put it upon somebody
[1:08:44] who didn't do anything
[1:08:46] amen
[1:08:47] verse seven
[1:08:48] he was oppressed
[1:08:51] and he was afflicted
[1:08:53] yet he opened not his mouth
[1:08:57] tongue
[1:08:59] he's brought as a lamb to the slaughter
[1:09:03] and as a sheep before
[1:09:05] her shears is dumb
[1:09:07] so he opened not his mouth
[1:09:10] regardless of what they were posting on
[1:09:12] facebook
[1:09:13] regardless of how many stories they were
[1:09:15] telling wrong about him he just didn't
[1:09:18] open his mouth he opened his mouth when
[1:09:20] they asked him about who he was
[1:09:23] amen
[1:09:24] amen
[1:09:25] you need to learn that young people
[1:09:27] quick send him a text quick check send
[1:09:29] him a text who are you to be sending
[1:09:31] people texts
[1:09:33] you might send the text block him
[1:09:40] don't play with me block
[1:09:42] so they don't receive water coming from
[1:09:44] you because you know what fire you put
[1:09:46] in you saw something wait for the return
[1:09:51] amen
[1:09:53] he was taken from prison
[1:09:55] and from judgment verse 8
[1:09:58] and who shall declare his what
[1:10:02] so this man
[1:10:03] who took the iniquity of us all
[1:10:06] who was afflicted who didn't open his
[1:10:09] mouth
[1:10:10] has a generation
[1:10:15] these are known men
[1:10:18] these unknown men
[1:10:19] carry a generation
[1:10:25] do you remember me telling you we will
[1:10:26] talk one day on the missing generation
[1:10:29] you remember
[1:10:32] depending on the time let's see
[1:10:35] he was taken from prison and from
[1:10:37] judgment and who shall declare his
[1:10:39] generation
[1:10:40] for he was cut off out of the land of
[1:10:42] the living for the transgression of my
[1:10:45] people was he stricken the question is
[1:10:49] who will declare
[1:10:52] this generation
[1:10:54] who's going to introduce
[1:10:57] who will make us know
[1:10:59] this generation
[1:11:01] we want to know his generation
[1:11:03] let's go to roman 2 then we will pray
[1:11:07] roman
[1:11:09] chapter 2 verse 28 very familiar
[1:11:12] scripture especially to this church
[1:11:15] if you dare you can say amen
[1:11:25] verse 28 for he
[1:11:28] is not a jew
[1:11:30] which is on
[1:11:32] which is one outwardly
[1:11:36] so when we talk about somebody being a
[1:11:38] jew
[1:11:40] paul is showing
[1:11:42] you something here
[1:11:43] he said there is a jew who can be
[1:11:46] outwardly
[1:11:48] desert words speak of the body
[1:11:51] hey marquee
[1:11:53] which speaking of what is natural
[1:11:55] we're speaking about about the natural
[1:11:58] blood
[1:12:00] anybody here
[1:12:01] he said one outwardly
[1:12:04] neither is that circumcision
[1:12:09] which is outward in the flesh so there
[1:12:12] is a circumcision right here of the
[1:12:15] flesh which is the body
[1:12:17] have a circumcision
[1:12:20] blessed be the name of the lord
[1:12:22] hallelujah but verse 29
[1:12:25] he is a jew
[1:12:27] which is one inwardly so now there is a
[1:12:30] second category offered you
[1:12:32] you can be a jew on the outside
[1:12:34] or you can be a jew on the inside
[1:12:38] on the inside we know we're speaking
[1:12:40] about the soul
[1:12:41] and the spirit
[1:12:43] and he's speaking about the spiritual
[1:12:46] amen and there is also a spiritual blood
[1:12:50] amen
[1:12:51] but this circumcision is of the heart
[1:12:55] amen
[1:12:56] amen amen
[1:12:58] hallelujah but he is a jew which is one
[1:13:01] inwardly and circumcision is that of the
[1:13:05] water so we're talking about the soul
[1:13:08] here
[1:13:09] everybody
[1:13:10] so you can be circumcised in the body
[1:13:13] and go to hell
[1:13:19] oh you can be circumcised in the soul
[1:13:22] and not circumcise in the body and go to
[1:13:25] heaven
[1:13:30] that's why paul told the galatians he
[1:13:33] said oh you foolish gallatin
[1:13:36] you start here you want to go back here
[1:13:39] again
[1:13:41] this was a type
[1:13:43] of something in the future
[1:13:48] amen
[1:13:50] the circumcision is that of the heart in
[1:13:53] the water
[1:13:55] and not in the letter the law
[1:13:58] whose praise is not of water
[1:14:01] but of water this circumcision here give
[1:14:05] glory to god
[1:14:07] the circumcision here give glory to man
[1:14:11] that's the pharisees circumcision when
[1:14:14] they go everybody will know that i am
[1:14:16] this this this
[1:14:18] versus a circumcision that give glory to
[1:14:20] god
[1:14:21] amen
[1:14:22] blessed be the name of the lord
[1:14:24] turn with me to isaiah 32 and let's pray
[1:14:28] so you will have that scripture handy
[1:14:31] when we get there
[1:14:33] isaiah 32 and let's pray
[1:14:37] if you get there you say amen
[1:14:41] isaiah 32.
[1:14:44] brother branham used
[1:14:45] chapter verse 1 and 2 when he preached
[1:14:48] letting off the pressure

[1:14:52] refuge let's pray heavenly father lord

[1:15:19] do when it comes to blessing your people
[1:15:22] interpreting your word lord father and
[1:15:24] giving a revelation to your children
[1:15:26] it's a work of the holy spirit that's
[1:15:29] why i'm asking that you move me
[1:15:31] completely out of the way may you speak
[1:15:33] to your children lord may you bless us
[1:15:35] be the beginning and the ending lord the
[1:15:38] alpha and the omega may the devil

[1:15:45] this place may only the holy spirit and
[1:15:48] the angel of the lord be seldom in the
[1:15:51] name of jesus christ
[1:15:53] amen
[1:15:54] god richly bless you i believe everybody
[1:15:57] should be on board with what we preach
[1:15:59] on wednesday we're on part six and we're
[1:16:02] still handling with uh talking about the
[1:16:04] priesthood amen
[1:16:06] now when we talked about the sea of
[1:16:09] flavor we found out that the sea of
[1:16:12] flavor is connected to the priesthood
[1:16:14] everybody
[1:16:16] i was wondering it is connected to the
[1:16:18] priesthood is connected to the
[1:16:20] priesthood to the fact that that sea of
[1:16:22] lever helped the priests wash the hand
[1:16:25] and wash their feet we pulled foot
[1:16:28] washing from there he helped the priests
[1:16:30] watch the sacrifice which we pulled the
[1:16:32] water baptism from there and then also
[1:16:36] in exodus chapter 40 we found out that
[1:16:39] not only were the feet and the hand of
[1:16:42] the priest washed all the sacrifice
[1:16:44] washed but before a priest enter into
[1:16:48] his office the priest himself must be
[1:16:51] washed completely but here
[1:16:53] these
[1:16:55] verses here have a lot of stuff going on
[1:16:58] we talked about moses already who was
[1:17:00] watching the high priest and his
[1:17:02] children we talk about the level itself
[1:17:05] and we lord's willing we will talk about
[1:17:07] the anointing that came upon the high
[1:17:09] priest and the children and we will also
[1:17:12] talk about the holy government everybody
[1:17:14] clear so far but let's handle the
[1:17:17] priesthood as we're moving forward
[1:17:19] when we talk about the priesthood
[1:17:22] we ended up with melchizedek amen
[1:17:25] because the lever when we look at the
[1:17:28] lever he only gave us the information
[1:17:31] about
[1:17:32] foot washing
[1:17:34] about here he gave us the information
[1:17:37] about water baptism
[1:17:39] but we were missing communion everybody
[1:17:43] but the priesthood have to be introduced
[1:17:46] here on the level and when we hit the
[1:17:49] levitical priesthood we found out that
[1:17:52] the levitical priesthood was only a
[1:17:54] shadow
[1:17:55] of the tree priesthood and when we are
[1:17:58] entering the tree priesthood of
[1:18:00] melchizedek
[1:18:02] anybody care we found out that that
[1:18:04] three priests that uh true priesthood
[1:18:08] opened up with a man called melchizedek
[1:18:11] or a personality called mercy memorial
[1:18:14] kizzadek and that personality is a king
[1:18:19] and he was also a priest
[1:18:22] and he brought abraham bread and wine
[1:18:25] everybody here which was communion so we
[1:18:28] got our three ordinances from there foot
[1:18:31] washing water baptism and we got
[1:18:33] communion right here everybody
[1:18:36] then we found also with melchizedek
[1:18:39] there is an everlasting power
[1:18:42] or an everlasting life
[1:18:44] he has no beginning of days no ending of
[1:18:47] life he's a man that ever lived forever
[1:18:50] and he's still there amen
[1:18:52] and under mercy merchandise also we
[1:18:54] learned about the paying of tithing
[1:18:58] anybody care and under melchizedek also
[1:19:01] his name have a double or a compound
[1:19:04] meaning
[1:19:05] he is king of selem which is talking
[1:19:08] about the righteousness
[1:19:10] and he is also king shalom
[1:19:13] or king of peace
[1:19:15] hey marquis
[1:19:17] but the problem is when we spoke about
[1:19:19] the levitical priesthood we found out
[1:19:22] who was the high priest of the
[1:19:25] priesthood
[1:19:26] it is very important to understand who
[1:19:29] is the high priest
[1:19:30] because the high priest is the one that
[1:19:33] first
[1:19:34] started everything else
[1:19:37] here and the high priest not only is he
[1:19:40] the first one to start something but the
[1:19:43] high priest is the one who make a way
[1:19:48] or who open up the way
[1:19:50] or who open up the road for his children
[1:19:54] ever here
[1:19:56] you cannot watch the children of the
[1:19:58] high priest before the high priest
[1:20:01] you have to start first with the high
[1:20:03] priest
[1:20:04] anoint the high priest
[1:20:06] dress the high priest and whatever was
[1:20:10] done to the high priest first is going
[1:20:12] to make a way all up in the way for the
[1:20:14] children of the high priest to go
[1:20:17] through the same process
[1:20:19] here because when israel was giving the
[1:20:22] atonement
[1:20:23] on the day of yom kippur everybody here
[1:20:26] the entire nation was looking at the
[1:20:29] high priest
[1:20:31] here if the high priest entered the holy
[1:20:34] of holies
[1:20:35] the holy of holies if the high priest
[1:20:38] succeed there
[1:20:40] then the sins of the people are
[1:20:42] completely taken off
[1:20:44] but if the high priest died there
[1:20:47] something is wrong
[1:20:48] so the the the salvation or the
[1:20:52] atonement of the entire nation lies on
[1:20:56] the shoulder of the high priest
[1:20:59] here and once the high priest is
[1:21:02] accepted he comes out from the holy of
[1:21:05] the holiest and he pulled what they call
[1:21:08] a trumpet
[1:21:09] like a
[1:21:10] like a ram horns and he brought the
[1:21:13] trumpet and that trumpet is the trumpet
[1:21:16] of jubilee
[1:21:17] and that trumpet of jubilee is telling
[1:21:20] everybody who was enslaved
[1:21:23] no matter the time
[1:21:25] no matter the circumstances no matter
[1:21:28] the problem when you hear that trumpet
[1:21:31] you can drop what you are doing and you
[1:21:34] can go back again to your inheritance
[1:21:37] even if you hold
[1:21:39] you owe your master a million dollars
[1:21:43] that's no more a problem if the jubilee
[1:21:45] trumpet sound you are debt free
[1:21:48] completely ever here
[1:21:50] you can go back for free and that
[1:21:53] jubilee lies on the high priest
[1:21:57] here so when we enter into the
[1:22:00] melchizedek priesthood we found out that
[1:22:03] melchizedek is a priest
[1:22:08] the bible say melchizedek a priest
[1:22:11] the bible did not say melchizedek a high
[1:22:14] priest
[1:22:15] everybody here
[1:22:16] so if this
[1:22:18] melchizedek he is a priest who is the
[1:22:21] high priest
[1:22:22] anybody here because it's important to
[1:22:25] know the high priest
[1:22:27] because once we know the high priest we
[1:22:30] know who can take our
[1:22:32] responsibility on his shoulder
[1:22:36] everybody
[1:22:37] but the understanding of the high priest
[1:22:40] brought us to first check the seed
[1:22:47] anybody here so far
[1:22:49] put your seatbelt
[1:22:51] because we're heading into some other uh
[1:22:54] territory
[1:22:56] the bible
[1:22:57] the bible says this
[1:22:59] we spoke about this on wednesday after
[1:23:01] the jews refused and rejected paul this
[1:23:04] is what happened
[1:23:05] for i could wish
[1:23:06] that myself were a curse for christ we
[1:23:10] know why paul said that if you listen to
[1:23:12] the sermon on wednesday you understand
[1:23:13] it for my present my kids men according
[1:23:17] to the flesh
[1:23:18] who are israelites
[1:23:20] to whom pretend the adoption that was
[1:23:22] the package god brought them
[1:23:24] and the glory and the covenant and the
[1:23:27] giving of the law and the service of god
