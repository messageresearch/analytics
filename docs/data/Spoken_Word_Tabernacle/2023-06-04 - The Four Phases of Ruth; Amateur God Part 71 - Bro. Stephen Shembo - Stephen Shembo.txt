up to date with the sermon okay glory to God praise be to the name of the Lord let's go to our reading material this morning it's going to be on uh Genesis chapter 2. you cannot be in this message 20 years 30 years 15 years and never even finished the church ages but uh David is there okay please give me volume so if nobody says a man I'm good just increase my volume amen I would never give you a gospel to please you amen no matter how much how upset somebody can get toward me I will continue to say the truth until one day when the Lord gives you the Revelation you will love me more amen and I'm gonna repeat it again you cannot be even 10 years in this message never read the seven churches you are losing you don't you don't have a foundation amen if you're 20 years in a message never even read the 70 weeks of Daniel there is no Foundation when we're laying the foundation you are blank how can you be in this message and always read the book of Psalms I don't know where that one comes amen and it's the evening book before you go to bed some if we're too tired we search for the shortest song so we can read that quickly and go to bed in the message 30 years and you're claiming Brad I'm the bride I'm the bride I'm the bride do you know where the bread feed on God give you one year from January all the way to December you cannot even finish two sermon one year you cannot finish two sermons to start to finish you cannot let's talk about politics and you will see how much people know amen okay that's wonderful that's the way I want Genesis chapter 2 if you dare you can say a man verse 21. the devil is not playing games now okay either you have God or you will see and the devil will prove to you that you don't have God okay so this church is not the message church where you come do your religion and you go I'm not here for that one I'm not here to get you here and then we finish we go to fellowship and begin to to joke and to play games and tomorrow again we get used to one another and we're in trouble I've seen all of that so that Tech game is over amen glory to God verse 21 and the Lord God calls a deep sleep you understand this now to fall upon Adam and he slept and he took one of his weebs and closed up the flesh instead thereof so Eve could not be made without a portion of Adam we okay now clear verse 22 and the rib which the Lord God has taken from man made he a woman and brought her to man and Adam says this is now born of my bones and Flesh of My Flesh she shall be called woman because she was taken out of man you might be seated so what we are looking at here again in Genesis chapter 2 is that God took a part of Adam amen which was a rib and from that rib God built a material everybody okay on top of this rib and when the material that was added onto the rib were completed they look like Adam when Adam looked at Eve Adam said this is not what and Flesh of My Water in other words Eve look like me the only difference between Adam and Eve is the gender Eve was a female a woman and Adam was a man but the the the material the body material the flesh the bond the sinew the muscles everything that was used on Adam was exactly identical to what Eve anybody okay so to build the Bride of Adam God needed first a portion of Adam everybody okay everybody okay and from that portion of Adam God begin to add more portions that look like Adam everybody okay so when Eve was finished Eve was nothing else but Adam in a female version everybody okay even the anatomy of Eve matches Adam I will get to that in a separate room with the young man the young sisters and everything and I will show you how God worked that up that's why when you get married you become one okay blessed be the name of the Lord let's go to Colossians chapter one Hallelujah there is a lot we need to learn in this message amen amen why was Eve made the way she was made Adam was a man why didn't God create Eve like like a man why did he change the morphology of Eve do you think he was just like that no if you understand this thing it will save you headache in marriage in other words he gathered so thin pretty good amen uh what do they say appointment Rendezvous on the 17th we will talk let's go in Colossians 1 verse 15. I will take the scripture and I will buy and and I will climb with the scripture whatever is written in this Bible will will will I measure everything is in this Bible it depends on how you read it Colossians 1 verse 15. so Eve have a portion of Adam and then the remaining of the material looks exactly like Adam so the bread must be made that way if you are True Blood of God God have to cut a portion of himself and put in you and from that portion God need to add more material to that portion according to where you were cut if you were cut from a wood they cannot add anything else but wood everybody okay if you were cut from a concrete God cannot add anything to you but concrete if you were cut from deity everybody okay everybody okay so God cannot add anything else but what he's adding is still deity because only deity will blend with deity it's the image of Daniel that have the clay and the ion it's two different material and it doesn't stick together everybody okay Colossians 1 verse 15 glory to God the Bible said who is the image of the invisible God you know what he means now the firstborn of every creature for by him where all things created that are in heaven and that are in Earth visible and invisible whether they be Thrones or dominions or principalities or Powers all things were created by Him and for him you need to understand these principles because God will not give you his power for you to make a play with it when you want to create something you have to be created for him glory to God Amen verse 17 and he is before all things you understand this and by him all things do water so all things hold together by him let's see how far we will go today if I will reach there let's go to Hebrew chapter 11. my friend is not here and he's postal duty this morning so brother Caleb hand the microphone to brother Benjamin amen I want to hear those big men voices like dirty that's what I want to hear foreign so you need to roar like a lion like a true lion amen Hebrew chapter 11 verse 1. if you dare you can say Amen verse 1 now Faith you there brother Benjamin okay is the substance of things hopeful so there is a hope first you hoping for something but hope doesn't get you nowhere you are still hoping as long as it's a hope it will be your dream like you hear people say my dream house everybody okay it's still a dream you are still hoping amen but it's not crystallized yet everybody okay everybody okay for whatever you have to live your dream and to begin to calm the sand down to becoming reality you must fund or you must channel that into faith everything when it's in faith even though you don't see it with your eyes it's already existed is it complicated we have the Realms of hopes Amen Let Me Circle it this way hope need to drop into faith amen and let me Circle this like this and Faith now will drop into reality or into materialization everybody okay so if you have uh I'm just gonna pick up if you have a car here everybody okay you can hope for this car all you want you can dream for this car all you want everybody okay if this car doesn't move from here into here you will never have it we're talking about the deity material okay once whatever car you have here jump into this thing this is imaginary this is where you make stuff okay you can make a project and put it right here it is still a project it's still a hope you are built like God this is your imagination everybody okay this is your design room are we okay this is your design room here you have to design it everybody okay and when you design something you have to go through inspection everybody okay if we design a plan like we're designing the fellowship right here the fellowship hall everybody okay you have to go through the engineering and they look at everything amen and they send it to the city to the county to be able to receive a stamp on it amen if your project is not according to the laws of duncani they send it back to the engineer they say you missing uh two screws here you're missing a tree here you're missing this this here and the engineering have to work again according to the law everybody okay so when you are designing your house where you are designing your fellowship hall you must design the fellowship hall according to the laws of the coming amen everybody okay when you are designing your future [Applause] why is it difficult when I tell you stuff about God everybody okay it's easy to tell you God will bless you God will bless you God will love God will protect you and then get you pumped up amen amen you need to create your own blessings everybody okay but when you are making your blessing you must have the laws amen that's why the Bible say if we ask anything according to his will so make sure whatever you're asking is matching his plan once he matches his plan then the architect will approve it everybody okay when it's approved it's no longer a hope he jumped into the favor everybody okay when it's first it's the time now for you to speak it this is not the time for you to get prepared to receive it [Applause] why do you want the house you want why do you want it like that why do you want a design yeah what is the motive behind it what are you trying to accomplish amen and if you get it what are you going to do with it [Applause] are you going to stay humble or are you gonna start posting that on WhatsApp Are You Gonna Keep Your prophecy or you will begin to take picture of even your bathroom what are you going to do with that housing when you pass that test everybody okay everybody okay everybody okay once you drop in the realm of faithful even if your bank account is negative if you have five hundred thousand dollars do you need Faith also you're fooling yourself everybody okay you don't need faith for that but the Seed of Abraham can cause things that are not everybody okay and begin to pull those things down until those things become material so what we are trying to do is to turn your God engine on [Applause] everybody okay everybody okay Hebrew chapter one if you're waiting for me to tell you something like oh faith is coming forth is coming that's why you miss it that's why we miss it who told you your car is going to crank this morning who told you that amen when you went to bed you knew I'm gonna be in church this morning and it happened how did it happen as simple as that happened that is as simple as everything can happen the problem is this man and his genetics and his environment and his education he want even God to channel his word according to his intellect for him to be for him to receive it God look at Gideon he say money man of Allah and Gideon maybe look at this say I don't have money you who are you talking to you talking to me amen because according to us Gideon should be exercising every morning have six packs and everything so when God said Mighty Men of father he said yes here I am God won't use you because you got too much strength do you know what he did to Israel when the Army was big he said if they go to war they win the war they will say because we were too big everybody okay when they take the medication they begin to give more credit to the medication than me oh when I take that medication it always work so when do we have a headache the self is telling no Talent or get more credit than God that's why you're telling them sometimes don't work and now you go to the medical doctor to give you something stronger and you brag about it oh man you take this one it works why you don't brag about God why you don't brag about God [Applause] because you don't have experiences with it you have experiences with Tylenol free of charge body now Faith is the substance of things water the evidence of fixed water in other words even though you have not seen it yet faith is declaring that it's there amen once this Faith here begin to declare that it's there that's it it's just a matter of time how it's going to happen that's not your problem verse 2 for buy it by faith the elders obtain a good water so if you want to have a good report what do you need let's continue the first three through faith that's why you heard Paul saying we heard the battery of faith in the Lord go read the scripture of Paul he was uh talking either to colossian or somebody said we heard about your faith it was the report of their faith what God is doing in their midst amen verse 3 through faith ready through the second set here through here so you gotta go through here amen through faith amen we understand that the world's plural were framed by the water the word of God by the word of God in other words before God spoke The World God have to believe himself okay true faith we understand in other words what was God creating with now Paul is describing that what God was using to create he was channeling everything through faith when he Channel through faith God was making the world in other words God was speaking believing what he's speaking that is where perfect faith is it will never miss he says through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God so that things which are water let me call this one amen whatever exists or that you see in through here amen before he was here he was first here amen you might have a project to never accomplish it but there are certain projects that will come to pass amen it depends on where it's coming from amen we understand that the words were framed by the word of God so that things which are seen natural naked eye were not made of things which do water so your material was not made out of a material your material was made by something that you cannot see yet it will that thing is what we call Faith amen it is a substance amen once you can touch something by faith that's it if faith can declare something it means that thing is there in other words whatever you want to know if he belongs to you go through the channel of faith use the hand of Faith to palpate the promises of God do you follow me he first get a hold of something and say Hey brother brother Jim whatever there is something here ask Faith what is it amen if first say it is this that say it belongs to you let's pray Heavenly Father Lord we are approaching you humbly again this morning Father we thank you once again for your grace for your love for your mercy and for everything you have been doing for us father thank you that you walk each person regardless of how much the devil fought father we are here this morning only by your grace Lord may you move me completely out of the way and may you come and speak to your children Lord feed us from the Heavenly bread and Lord may you lock the devil completely out the atmosphere seems to be gloomy outside but Lord father we are not depending on the Zodiac or the other court to be able to worship you but father we are living in the holiest so that no matter what atmosphere is outside it doesn't affect our relationship with you father may you come and bless us and bless those that are streaming and that will be streaming later for we commit them unto their hand Lord and this church and this service for the glory of your own name in the name of Jesus Christ amen glory to God hallelujah my subject this morning everybody okay everybody okay my subject this morning is the four phases of roof amateur God amen amateur God who is an amateur guy [Applause] amen what does amateur God means because we talk about our own internal being now we want to talk about amateur God we are not talking about professional God everybody okay everybody okay there is a difference between an amateur and a professional a professional is somebody who's pursuing a career for money everybody okay a professional is somebody who is in sport and the sport is his living he's under a contractor he's there to make money he's there to make a living everybody okay but a man amateur is somebody who is in the sport not for money everyone okay he's in sport for leisure he's in sport for fun everybody okay he's in sport for pleasure when he's playing sport he's not playing to win something everybody okay he's not playing sports so that at the end he will be remunerated everybody okay in other words and not mature is somebody who sport is his life everybody okay everybody okay a lamb does not make Wishful to make money everybody okay he just eat and the wool comes up and the purpose of his work is not for him to make money it's not for him to go to the market and say see how much wool I have the wool is his life the war is part of him everybody okay so I'm not sure doesn't have selfishness [Applause] everybody okay everybody okay when you put a race everybody's nervous because there is a press to erase and everybody want to win the race and everybody's nervous but when you call the same people to a marathon nobody wins in the marathon the pressure is taken off now everybody is running in its own space everybody okay everybody okay so I'm not sure God are not in competition [Applause] amen I'm not your God are not here to show her spiritual you are I'm not your God are not here to look at the neighbor they are living The Godly life for themselves and for their pleasure because this is one who they are did you get what I just said everybody okay in other words he take the pressure off of you you don't need to prove me that you're a Christian you don't need the approval of anybody you don't need somebody patting you on the shoulder all the time to tell you you the best Christian that is [Applause] everybody okay there is only one person that I worry it is only the Lord Jesus Christ as long as he's telling me keep pressing on keep moving on keep calming on that's all that matters amen I am not in this message for competition I am not in this message to make money I came here to live my life so that whoever God made me to be can be expressed freely without any pressure [Applause] in other words if I need to get mad I will get mad [Music] and after I get mad I will ask God to deliver me from that spirit everybody okay not because of you I'm holding my anger now I'm trying to please you I'm trying to make myself good to your eyes and one day it's gonna blow up everybody okay so it's better for it to blow up so that God can express to you your impurities whatever needs to come out of your life so you can fix it up [Applause] amateur God amen it's selfless amen you don't worry about the next one you dare live in your own life you don't go to sport because if you don't go there they're gonna fire you that's not amateur amateur I go to sport when I want and when I'm going I'm relaxed and when I feel like the game is over for me not for you I can live under that and go home peacefully I don't owe you nothing [Applause] everybody okay everybody okay glory be to the name of the Lord oh my God we are deep deep into roof chapter four and we are dealing with the last phase of roof which is the departure of roof and the changing of Tabernacle because we started from justification unto sanctification from sanctification to the baptism of the Holy Spirit and from their roof need to change their mention and go into a different dimension if you recall in the Book of Revelation chapter 4 when John was taken out or apple which brother Branham said John was the top of the bride and by John being caught up in Revelation 4 brother Barnum said he was the top of the rapture everybody okay everybody okay because the word rapture is not in the Bible the word used is to be caught up so John was caught up in Revelation 4 and if when was soon as he entered Heaven the first thing that he saw was a throne everybody okay why the throne everybody clear because in the last age of the Gentile in the laodicea age it is promised to the overcomer everybody okay let's go to revelation 3. [Music] let's go to Revelation 3 my friend I'm still climbing just about to break the sun bear if you dare you can say man the last Church the age of the Gentile the last one what is God promising to the overcoming of that age did you see that Revelation chapter 3 let's go to verse 21. aha somebody saw it everybody okay Revelation is mathematically placed this Bible got math this Bible got biology he got even macrobiology he got geometry it teaches you the pyramid and everything wait till we get to that amen everybody good verse 21 to him that the water overcometh we like going to do it with me in mind why are you sitting on the throne of God how many of us are here how all of us are going to sit on one throne everybody okay what do you do with a throne when you sit for your only Throne what do you have to do who are you so the age of laodicea is preparing Kings [Applause] the Lord is your message is a message that is building rulers [Applause] it is building people that will be winning people that will be given command everybody okay and they will reign not smaller than God am I reading a different Bible they will win like God because you have been granted to sit on the throne of God let this man be in water that was also in who right that he thought not robbery to be watered with who ah yes yes not in any age only loudly such a change everybody okay everybody good is it clear okay the Bible said to him that overcometh we are going to sit with me in mind even as I also have done water and I'm set down in and I'm set down with my father in his water jump to Revelation 4 verse 1. after this I look and behold the water was open in water and the first voice which I heard was as he were a water talking with me which said and I will show you things which must come water and immediately I was in the spirit and behold a water so the first thing that you get to heaven is your position [Applause] everybody okay everybody okay so the throne that was on the earth is picking you up until you matches the throne in heaven everybody okay everybody okay everybody good so the first thing that you enter into heaven the first thing that John saw is the throne why the throne everybody good everybody good are we okay we found out last Sunday glory to God that God before he stopped creating anything God have to create or to birth himself you remember last Sunday anybody okay and the way God birth himself is God quickened himself everybody okay if you are a seed God also is a seed everybody okay so the first seed that was quick and was God himself everybody okay so when God quickened himself God came as a quick and seed and he he Murphy you understand this now God changed from from the invisible God into the seed that he just quick and which is the logos everybody okay then God took a light you remember that song A covering a theophany amen and Veil himself around and God was inside the light and from that light from that aspect everybody okay God begin to create everything everybody okay now the problem between me and you we didn't go on that line everybody okay we bypass that process instead of being taught quickened and going into our way to your funny amen we were never quickened by God [Music] everybody okay everybody okay matter of fact what God did God created your human being and took your thought your seed your word and quickened dormant sleeping and took you and drop you into the flesh everybody okay that's why you don't know who you are Jesus knew who he was because Jesus was already quickened everybody okay and within that seed is the entire plan of your life he says you were on water by who God nothing happened by Waters with who God he knows all about you it is our water plan for many Waters Generations so that you could be here when did you know that [Applause] [Music] you're coming this morning in this church and the place you are sitting and the clothing you are wearing was already pre-planned [Music] [Applause] let me try to help you up the clothing and the color of the clothing of the vice president was already pre-planned before there is no Direction [Applause] come all I didn't have any other color to wear but purple because the prophet of God went back in the mind of God and so Kamala fell off and he prophesied that there will be a vice president a woman wearing which color did it happen he was assessed alone [Applause] the children you have are programmed by God so don't hate your children because God gave you the best God already prepare your children no matter how they are struggling God doesn't give you a bad gift the Bible says the blessing of God he doesn't add sorrow to it all right if God give you what you think is a troublemaker you need to go back together right that's right everybody okay everybody good everybody good so that seed was never quickened and you were placed into the body we design it like this now you acquainted with this right so they put a seed here and they seed they place here is dormant amen but this seed is coming from an eternal destination from an eternal civilization everybody okay everybody okay these three parts here your body your spirit and your soul this is the you that is temporal everybody okay but the seed is the you that is eternal amen so because the seed was dropped into you dormant everybody okay this is why you didn't know who you were amen and this one was more active than this one and you begin to educate this one we begin to train this one and this one got more preeminence in your life than this one everybody okay listen to brother Branham glory to God Amen this seed what they need is an Awakening we saw that last Sunday but it depends on which age it is everybody okay he must stumble you but I have to drop it everybody okay the Holy Ghost was given in the age of power everybody okay but the holy ghost that dropped there do you follow me was unable to take the people to this world [Applause] he was still the Holy Spirit but he was the holy spirit with limitation everybody okay you can choose this writers the Holy Ghost of Luther could only stop a justification but he was still the Holy Spirit everybody okay the Holy Ghost of Wesley could move from justification to sanctification and stop right there and you can go no higher than that one [Music] everybody okay that's why the Rapture never happened in those ages everybody okay the holy ghost in the Pentecostal could only go to the restoration of the gift and stop there amen we need the measure of the Holy Ghost That should be Unlimited [Music] everybody okay we need the holy ghost that will restore God back on Earth Jesus Christ was the world made water so the end of the Gentile age must be the world made what we must move from the alpha and to the water and the Alpha and the Omega must be water [Applause] what made Jesus what he was because he had the fullness of the godhead how far in this end time we must also have water after God had how because we must be born of his the Flesh of his water we must be him [Applause] everybody okay everybody okay everybody okay that's why the second oil could never be opened by the Virgin until the Midnight Cry [Applause] [Music] and brother Branham said he was the seventh to watch he was the seventh Church ages amen amen so to wake a seed of God today you need to know which message is Awakening that's it okay everybody okay brother Branham says this the bread has not had water there is no there has been water no we fight for there no water of God to stir the water but God was Healing The Sick God was raising the Dead God was removing cancer but brother Branham said the bride regardless of everything you see God doing under the first and second tool the bread is still not awakened [Applause] amen which manifestation laying hand on a sick everybody can do that everybody okay brother Branham say we are looking for each one he shall take those water back there to the water and he shall do it why because he did what promise so the only message that can wake the seed to the caliber that God wanted is a message of the seven pandas which are the Revelation contained under the seventh seal [Applause] because when the seal are broken this entire Bible is completely open [Applause] [Music] [Applause] now we are not dealing with a portion that we are dealing with the fullness there are limited of God [Applause] everybody okay everybody okay everybody good let's progress glory to God therefore this is not time to play pull up this thing quickly everybody okay brother Branham say a real seed of God this is where we stop last Sunday this is where we stop last Sunday a real seed of God is a water for the water do you know what the word absorbent means [Music] [Applause] when brother Branham use his word you need to be very careful absorbent mean that it was designed to suck everybody okay and he does a sack slowly he suck easily everybody okay absorbent means he was designed to capture he was designed to receive everybody okay to receive the Holy Spirit in other word whatever is in this seed everybody okay everybody okay have something in it that can [Applause] that can capture the spirit of God quickly in other words if this is the seed and the Holy Ghost come playing around everybody okay before you know it the Holy Ghost will find himself [Applause] [Music] is for God to pass by you [Applause] when I say Arrow it's stumbling you everybody okay the biggest mistake God will do is to come across and pass by you he did it for blind Bartimaeus as he said who's passing there they're saying to Jesus he says son of David the people say shut up he said mm-hmm give me some water so sorry [Applause] do you know how people Jesus head around him do you think Jesus heard him everybody okay once it drop in the realm of Heaven he will catch Jesus wherever Jesus is Jesus pushed the brick and say what you bring him here why because Jesus made a mistake passing that way I'm you I'm calling that mistake so you understand what I'm trying to say everybody okay so the seed of God when it's designed it's designed to suck the Holy Ghost in other words there is a magnet in the seed that can shut the Holy Spirit if the Holy Spirit ever play around the sea he will never come out God one time instead of saying in heaven minding his business he saw Jacob in trouble and God getting Jacob business to mind Jacob business everybody okay when Jacob saw God had the difficulty going back to heaven everybody okay because Jacob data love you remember last Sunday the seed of Jacob that I love amen when he saw the angel of the Lord he locked God foreign God cannot go nowhere in other words Jacob leaves me I got business to say he said you're not going nowhere everybody okay until you do it and when he pray over Jacob what happened to Jacob Jacob God said who this boy everybody okay why who was holding God who was holy God [Applause] do you think you can hold god with your hand do you think you can block God the angel of the Lord can pass here and go so how can a human block God who was blocking God [Music] in other words you the way you are you can block everything in heaven now everything in other words if God is in the meeting amen you can stop the meeting of God so God can block everything until he reach you [Music] God was going to Jerusalem and Jesus said I must need to go away who was pulling him over there who was fooling God in other words you won't die yet Jerusalem until you change my life [Applause] [Music] [Applause] have I lost anyone [Applause] brother Prana he says all denominationalist Miss water to God all unbelief is water and when the Holy Spirit come into the water that is laying away he produce another sea just how exactly another water Son of God is water amen another water amateur God let's stop there let me reap another layer my friend I believe you can swallow this now follow me carefully you ready are we ready are we ready when a child is conceived in the mother's womb amen amen when a child is conceived in a Mother's tubes we have an egg amen this egg is dormant I can get in the detail if you want me to everybody okay and this air dormant is not dead put your seat belt and swallow this okay another one this egg got life in it that is sustaining it alive amen and from the parent from the father comes another cell everybody okay this cell got their blood cell everybody okay I have quotes for it amen I can go to biology or to the message I'm I'm covered everybody okay you got the blood cell or the hemoglobin go go go searching your message everybody okay so this blood cell here is a love everybody okay another word he also have life that's why it's able to move everybody okay everybody good when these two meets together like I explained last Sunday there is a light that comes everybody okay when these two meet together amen defuse together and when the fuse they do become one everybody good everybody good the two become one and this is what we call a conception oh the baby's dead this baby is not true lives I'm going slowly and I'm heading somewhere this baby it is not true life everybody okay this baby is only one life what happened is this life and this life fuse together if you don't understand this you understand the mystery of birth control with the younger sister I will deal with the younger brother so in your marriage you you don't bring me trouble okay so you will be fine everybody okay everybody okay everybody okay everybody good so the baby is not the baby that is coming up this one is already a baby [Applause] if you kill this one you are killing a human being praise be to the name of the Lord everybody clear everybody clear this one begin to multiply everybody okay and begin to add cells on top of itself and then begin to create the leg and begin to create the head and begin to create the arm and begin to create all of that amen what I'm trying to point to you is this multiplication this division this development is a life I know brother Branham sometimes who say that it's just the body jerking but that body is not jerking like that that body is jerking because he has life William Marion brother that is what you are two a water multiplication of water well you know where you come from holy wedlock between water and water one leader tiny water I just explained it to you if I was going to tear your body down tonight take it out myself he come down to one leader life inside of their life of course there is a water a chemistry of the water and inside the blood is the water and that is the light and that life is who and he begin to water multiply ourselves everybody okay that's why when you kill this guy you are killing the baby this one is you that's what brother Branham said everybody okay everybody good listen to brother Branham again glory to God there is a baby he's begotten in its mother water we are right here conception it's got water everybody clear daddy's life and the little cell in its body is twisting and water and water jumping like that so when Mama is pregnant sometimes when the baby begins to grow mothers are here they will hear a kick amen that kick is a baby it is a life amen maybe mama need to change position in the bed because the baby kicked this way amen if you put maybe some kind of music mother knows what I'm talking about or sometimes if you play the type of brother brother you will hear that baby kicking everybody okay he's kicking because he's alive because there is a life in that baby everybody clear I'm gonna get there where I'm going brother Branham say but when it's born he has brother Branham clap his hand to us imitating water do you like that and then he does water then he become a water follow me carefully whatever I showed you here is happening in the natural in the mother's womb everybody clear but in the spiritual hand do you follow me you are also there everybody okay you exist in the spiritual hand I said so and a spirit everybody okay two lives but they made water the soul and the spirit is also one life everybody okay so one mama is delivering the baby out everybody okay he's delivering the body with a life and that life only have few seconds or few minutes everybody is following me I'm trying to help you in every Court of William ion Runner everybody okay as soon as the baby come with this life this life here are you following me we're entering this baby everybody okay and this life you following me and this life everybody okay we're fuse together amen do you follow me do you follow me until there is no distinction between the two lives that your life are compatible this life came by sex and your soul is designed based on the sex act everybody okay so this life and this life fuse together and they make one life everybody okay everybody okay and when they become one life you can never separate them let me start again when this cell and this cell fuse together to make a baby you can never separate this again we okay when this life and this life mixed together you can never separate them together if they don't fuse together this baby will die everybody okay that's why the wise woman spank the baby in other words quickly buddy go ahead and activate [Music] hey everybody okay when they speak the baby and the baby goes why actually it is this life and this life has joined together in other words the tree of life has made together like this and then suddenly the baby's shaking Have I Lost somebody Have I Lost somebody where are you going with this and what are you trying to say everybody okay this is the mystery of your natural birth not on the spiritual eternal life this life here everybody okay this life here is what was making you jump in mommy's belly this life here was giving you all the kicking mommy was receiving it was you with this life but this life when it comes it's more than a kicking it brings the crying he brings the sacking of milk it brings everything to your life everybody okay [Music] everybody good everybody good so on your Eternal line you also started as a seed are you okay this seed also have life and this life is eternal life [Music] everybody okay so when God take the seed and bless him to you you already have the Holy Ghost I have quotes my friend I have coached my friend let me help you up you already have eternal life this eternal life is there amen just like the baby was kicking in Mama's womb this eternal life is there to block you from moving forward beyond God [Applause] everybody okay that's why you can smell marijuana by you will hear somebody you kicking like I ain't touching marijuana everybody okay everybody can get drunk and die your drinking will not kill you everybody okay everybody okay everybody okay that's why brother Branham say I gave you the code last Sunday that remember when you were a little boy when everybody do something and you do the same thing and you feel a condemnation what was condemning you brother Branham said there was God somewhere there was eternal life somewhere it is this life that was in your predestinated scene whenever you do something bad you will never enjoy it at the end of the day you will be more miserable and you'll be tormented for life because of certain mistakes that you did they want tormenting you is your seed it is the life in your seed amen but that life alone is not enough it needs a quickening Hallelujah everybody okay just like this life has to get in this baby everybody okay and fuse together are you following me when the Holy Ghost come on you everybody okay the Holy Ghost is just so eternal life [Music] everybody okay so when the Holy Ghost squeaking you everybody good the two lives their eternal life that was in your seat and they eternal life that come from the Holy Ghost meet together and you are born again this is the true marriage of the land [Applause] [Music] [Applause] that's when you become the wife of God that's when you become United with God because you that was in the predestiness it seed and the holy ghost that was coming God and you join together you become John hey you become one everybody okay until they can never separate you from God everybody okay until there won't be any distinction again between you and God what God think you think what God like you like because God and you are becoming Have I Lost somebody this is the new birth this is the new birth this is the marriage and once you are united by God by the Holy Ghost everybody okay which bring also eternal life when eternal life and eternal life meet together diffuse when eternal life and eternal life if I take these two others and mix them together you will never separate which order is what the two of them become [Applause] everybody okay so when you begin to pray it is like Jesus praying [Music] thank you [Applause] everybody okay everybody okay so when you pray that's why Jesus said when you pray don't come in your name tell him our way because we are becoming one you don't go yourself put me in when me and you are mixed he won't tell the difference [Music] he doesn't know if it's Jesus Christ or is he with you everybody okay is the new birth complicated it's the Holy Ghost complicated it is God coming to God it is God man coming to God you brother and when you are John it is an invisible everybody okay and if you are joined with him in the realm the next step is he belongs he now want to see you in the body foreign [Applause] because you are already Spirit of his spirit that's why when you're gonna see him you will be like because on the east side you already look like [Music] any difficulty listen to brother Branham a baby can go to church and say oh I believe in church I shall go I shall do this I want to do right I want to do right but what he needs is a gospel Waters wake it up to the water [Music] this is the mystery of the lunar ego in the barnyard that's the mystery of the Ludo ego he was born in the wrong environment he was educated by chicken he was eating chicken food talking like a chicken and the eagle was sleeping but one day Mama ego come [Applause] [Music] everybody okay everybody okay not his mama bigger never give him birth again [Applause] everybody okay everybody okay their mama ego all she need to do was to scream the scream doesn't change the ego the scream doesn't change anything the Scream one distract the eagle he wiped the ego up amen [Applause] he's already illegal he just needed the shout the message to wipe the eagle up everybody okay everybody okay when the shout hit the ego the ego will last that I am an eagle I am not a chicken that's why everything was not blending [Applause] that's why you could not blend with your family your family drink you don't drink you don't understand why because you came from a different species you came from A Different World [Applause] you are not a child of a chicken [Music] you are a child of God [Applause] [Music] [Applause] everybody okay everybody okay is the new birth complicated when the ego wake up the EGO begin to understand this is why when I was eating I just don't like the food now I understand now I understand we will understand it better everybody okay everybody okay everybody good everybody good that's your mystery of being born again and once you are born again once you realize who you are now you must follow the instruction of Mama ego now Mama ego have more instruction for you flap your wings you need to stay now in connection with Mama ego to tell you what to do [Applause] don't worry if you flap your wings and and you still spinning no problem Mama is under training continue to follow destruction when you flap the wings sometimes you might go this way and mama said use this one go ahead this one use the Old Testament and the New Testament use the full word thank you and when you begin to Flap before you know it you begin to to defer the law of gravity towards the heaven [Applause] [Music] where am I at in time my friend everybody okay everybody okay everybody okay the new birth is not a complication [Music] you are always the son of God you are always a child of God you just didn't know who you are you thought you were the child of your father and your mother sometimes the one who give you birth will go in hell because truly your father is dead When you pray say our that's your true father we appreciate our father here but remember you got a bigger father than that when you are born it's not by the will of men not by the will of the flesh but but the will of who God everybody okay have I lost anyone glory to God the Bible brother Branham saying then you begin to do water to grow move and have water it's a big way see just as baby natural baby he has been in the water certain this voice I will preach with it glory to God listen to Brother Brad he said like a baby four minutes mother woman when the baby comes to the mother womb by the little water he does water into the water we already seen that it does not form oneself a human and the next water and the next water and the next what it will be all water because it's building off an original [Music] in other words every cell that is building on top of this baby must be human cell everybody okay you don't put the captain no because it's not a cat birth everybody okay so if you on the spiritual you are born by the word of God so everything that will begin to be added won't be the material of the world it will be word on top of word on top of word on top of word on top of word that's why God taught brother Branham store up the word stir up the food because once an eagle is born he begin to read messages after messages ask the messages after messages after messages before you know it you are building another Giant that's why I'm telling you read your Cod read the church edges read the seal listen to the message because you cannot put something different than the world upon [Applause] land upon here before you know it you had a few gunman praise God Believe It or Not brother brother Robin I'm a five percent of the sermon I have 89 move we are five percent we won't get to that let's say this when a man has been born again by the water how to water eternal life call water of God on top of word on water not the denominational and then Earth and a Creed anyone you can't have that level in it only water why why who this eternal life and this eternal life are [Applause] that's why if a preacher if a preacher come in this public by invitation and begin to say something that is not like the word you hate that man [Applause] you will hear something in you questioning the preacher you don't know the court you never seen the court but something in you is telling you that doesn't sound good it is not you it is the eternity he only take the word and the world only [Applause] as soon as you leave the church brother Stephen text message tell me a little bit what was that preacher saying why because something in you didn't wing where did you know the word who taught you the message that you begin to tell where what is right and what is wrong how do you know what is right and what is wrong did you read the entire message so how can you tell how can you tell it wrong because this guy he knows everything even if you don't know the scripture he knows everything and the day you will see the court you will find yourself just because the Lord that's why that's why that's why that's why you would be like why now I see why yeah yeah yeah man they say what's going on you say I'm sorry yeah man yeah man what is going on it is that man over there [Applause] [Music] the devil can do anything except to deceive the very [Applause] you can touch you cannot touch that one never never the person even if you sugarcoat the world anyway that person won't work with you amen that's why many said in this message have been laying dormant in message churches because they were not preaching the true message or the preacher was deluding the message and the young people are unable to grow but let them come to a real message of church where the message is laid down you don't teach them to be on church on time you don't wake them on Sunday they can't wait to be Sunday what is pressing the young people what is giving them the hunger what are they looking for [Applause] who is trying to suck that word why because somebody is awaken you can turn around you say oh three years ago I remember what I was struggling but today I'm not what I used to be [Applause] why somebody begin to grow begin to grow and you will understand that the Holy Ghost was already new I know where your struggle is I hope I can find there because I have to deal with your condemnation okay okay but I can't get there let me try to close quickly glory to God Amen my god brother Branham says that another amateur God is water it's a Son of God so according to brother Branham I'm not even at my normal time yet I still have 27 minutes to my normal time the problem is we in turn in eternity and some of you are already spilling the food because the belly are full everybody okay brother Branham say and I'm mature God amateur God is a Son of God and we know that Son of God is water God ah I love I love that I love that praise God you make me feel good as a pastor amen I went to a place and I've seen a lot of young people and then when I look at them their haircut and I look at the way they were and they're grooming I begin to say I said this is what is message believer but thank God I found one young man from spoken word was there and I saw him doing something there he was playing an instrument and I could go home in peace and say at least father man is there my spoken word is there when I look at him he's quiet he's just well he's sitting well he's acting like a gentleman I say I'm doing some work I'm proud of you man I'm proud of you I can tell the difference between mine and the other one so I know I'm not preaching in vain and I'm proud of the young man when I see them and the way they behave they come brother Stephen brother Stephen brother Stephen I look at them I say that is the material of spoken word Tabernacle everybody okay that's why I love them they know that I have a group chat we talked with them all the time they they text me at 12 o'clock at 1am we talk because they're not complicated all they want is the word when they send the question they say brother Stephen what about this what about this what about this what about no politics everybody okay right about them said they remember they control the Earth he was an amateur water for he was a water a Son of God is a what amateur God it's now that ain't contrary to the scripture and no that sounds how strange what are you trying to get into it pastor let me see in the next 20 something minutes say there is something about the man he is a you should be swallowing that now okay he was meant to be a his purpose here on Earth was to be a God to have water of the water oh my now don't let that stagger you because I got some more scripture wrote downward here where are you going brother Stephen brother Branham say if you have not received it how do you can you believe miracles who in you to do whatever so who's believing believing who the Lord say to Ma so now you begin to understand when Jesus was saying father I know that you hear me we were thinking about father over there amen until Philip said show us there because Philip taught the father is somewhere and Jesus is somewhere Jesus said you don't understand when you see me you see the father me and my father We Are One everybody okay everybody okay go read brother Branham you will hear Brother Branham say then I Heard a Voice from weaving saying this is the third pool not outside here okay let me continue that takes you in YouTube you know what I like you act like you not like God you think like God the Bible said that you are amateur meaning I will poke this until he gets into you even if you remove it I will continue to push it to push it until you get tired then you say yes brother Stephen I'm God everybody okay Jesus said and you are leader whoever you are maybe leadership and because your parent is that the nature that you are is because your parent is that because you were born off that is this man and the reason that you believe God and believe in miracle and sand and water and and wonders because you are and others often you receive life life come on everybody okay we're gonna get into Hot Potato body but especially upon Adam God breathes the breath of eternal life and he become a water an eternal person with who he had power like God he was a weapon amateur God he was God of the earth not God of the water heaven now God of the water someday the sons of God will again become Gods [Applause] which day Jesus said so is not it written in the law ye are Gods then if you can call those who he call God who God visited how can you condemn me say when I say I am the Son of God now we are getting into something now watch this when we drive it down let's go oh if you could only realize that's you man you were made to be an amateur God you are a son of God you are heir of who God and you have a water Dominion in Genesis 1 26. he give him Dominion of everything in the Earth he made him a god of a dear that is right he gave him a domain he's a remember audition a god and where he got his fall he could speak to the trees be changed be plugged up and stand over there to the wind and the wave distilled and stop he was God a amateur little God a Son of God like you are a son of your water father all the world is doing water and waiting for the water waiting for the church to get back in its water sons of God to be made how waiting for water [Music] now when we say manifestation of the sons of God now you begin to understand what it means what is it brother Branham this may do whatever [Music] but did you know that man that are sons of God are amateur God how many ever know that how many knows that Jesus said so did not your lord say itself that ye are God and if you call them God which God in Genesis 2 that they were God because they were had full domain over over the Dominion of the world he gave him dominion over everything and he lost his water he lost his water he lost his water and Satan took it over but brother we are waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God who will come back and take it over when okay waiting for the water when the water gets where when the sons of God will be how when the power of God will walk out Hallelujah and will take every Power that's set and water from water yes sir he belongs to who ah remember we're going word on top of wood ah but this is the day off the water of the Water mystery that has been water since the foundation of the world will be what may know so the sons of man God can never be manifested if the seals are not broken [Applause] until the opening of this hill nobody will manifest that attribute we play with the seals too much he is the logos that went out of God that is true that was the son of God he made man a little God if they call those who the word of God came the prophet if they called them Gods who the word of God came to and God said so himself that they were gods amen you ready he thought who God and Aaron your water a man I may act like a religious crank but I am not when your eyes can open and see those things which things which feeds brother Stephen let me hurry up now why are we talking about this brother Branham say God Robert to Genesis to the original what is it now with the world and the nature is growing crying everything is doing water what for the manifestation of the water sons of God when true Sons foreign speak and the word is water I believe we are on the order of you right right now yes sir say to water this mountain Let It Be Water so brother I desire so-and-so a certain things done I am believer in Jesus Christ you will say to him water I give it to you in the name of the water lord Jesus Christ amen there is a water manifestation brother brother me saying a manifestation means when somebody comes to you with a trouble just like they were coming to Jesus Christ with the trouble Jesus never sent back like that Jesus found a solution so you must find the solution if they say brother I need so-and-so you need to tell them I give it to you you still doubting that I understand you but let's continue to poke it [Applause] everybody okay I know you're still doubting that if somebody come and say I have a problem use uh the first thing you begin to think about the bank whether you have money in the bank whether you have money on the saving whether you are because that's the way we were wired we we think about God at the last minute did we even pray about it that come late [Music] now it's time to switch brother Branham say if somebody come and say oh brother my crop are burning up you under I have not got any water you tell him I send you a reigning in the name of the water [Music] oh wedding and doing water or nature is water for the manifestation of the water God or damn it a death beginning he gave men the water don't worry my friend we're getting there brother Brandon says there is where God is trying to get the church just to say to this Mountain Water and he will do water what is it Authority sons of God the whole creation is groaning wedding for the manifestation of the sons of God waiting to a spot to wear that the sickness will be a water all right in other words when somebody's sick you say Hey you get out of here no more I will go to the emergency room but you pray for me let's continue it will be that way the plan to receive their sat down deaf and dumb we pray for them now but them you shall do whatever we are praying for people now brother Branham said but when we manifest the Son of God we don't pray anymore we begin to water because the Centurion Roman told Jesus Christ you don't need to come I understand command and Jesus called that a great faith never find even at the Jews it was found in there I am also a gentile [Applause] brother Branham he says didn't say this son shall follow them that believe they shall pray for the sick he said they shakastra devil not I will they will if you say to this mountain not if I brother pranam is removing Jesus he said no to Jesus saying am I reading something different he said not if I if you say to this mountain be water and don't doubt in your heart what we need is water sons and daughter needs water how can the church depend a coastal church and the Methodist and the Baptist Church be adopted until they come to water discipline why discipline we got to be water disciplined first God could not trust this power with the church it is hard to tell what you would do [Music] in other words you are wired born fashion design built a god that's no moral problem we already solved that when the Holy Ghost come he's coming to wake the god up and the God is awakened and the god need to go and become a big big big God the problem is God doesn't have a problem with power he doesn't have a problem with what he built the engine you are God has a problem with your discipline before he release everything the man is in the back [Music] everything you desire there is money to cover it the problem is that you trustworthy to be given their bank account [Applause] because if they are listed wrong you make people disappear on the highway [Music] if somebody crosses you wrong you disappear come on and power with that character is water so what will determine the discipline now placing the water first thing after the sun was he became a water but then we found out his water is what set him where did he behave right oh [Music] amen if you don't know how to discipline yourself to the things of God God will lock the power the engine is there the power is there but the character is needed in order to handle the power everybody okay everybody okay if you don't know how to discipline your prayer life you don't know how to discipline your church life you don't know how to give God things the preeminence in your life God locks it because you will become lazy everybody okay everybody okay everybody okay get the eight years old go give him a million dollars the first thing he want to buy the firm of the candy because he has a candy mind according to him he can eat candy all day and be happy so God cannot give the million dollar to you because you still have a candy mind you need to think like God you need to talk like her you need to behave like God how does God behave on Sunday everybody okay the Bible says it was a custom to Jesus Christ to be always going to church that was the custom of God on the Sabbath day you won't block Jesus from going to church no matter what you put Jesus will go there when they take Jesus Christ into Jerusalem to worship when his friends are playing [Music] and the father thought he's playing with his friend when they check his friend he's not dead I'm reading to you the Bible the one to his friend they said where is Jesus they say maybe he's hanging on downtown over there yes yes maybe they went to the park they went to the park they said where is Jesus he's not here where Jesus but you were with him three days ago no no we don't even remember they went three days to Jerusalem amen when they went where did they find him how did he eat in three days yeah they found him among water among water the people of his age among the people older than him talking about water that is God in human form so when you give him Leisure and you give him the things of God he will God God will leave everything and go away the things of God is because it is his I must be about my father my father what business if you are a god and God is your father you must be about water your father's business so one will be the first thing in your life everybody okay as much as you are investing for your life amen you need to invest for God everybody okay which preeminence are you giving to God when they say let's go to church what comes in your mind when they say we have question and answer where are you when they say we have prayer on church where are you foreign what are you doing everybody okay what are you doing what investment are you doing because afterwards you need the supernatural to live in this world the Beast is tightening everything until you must agree with his system in order to survive normal so you must also build your investment so that you won't depend on the bank [Applause] no problem it's the cpf value no problem if your mother fail you no problem if your husbands have you no problem as long as I know who I am [Applause] everybody okay everybody okay let me Wander from a minute a day listen to brother Branham brother Branham say I've often said that the greatest water our God is who the devil how can brother Branham be an enemy of God I thought the enemy was the devil now brother Prana begin to turn you to a different enemy why is he your enemy why are you your enemies you see that sometimes you blame the devil for nothing and the devil said to God they keep blaming me I didn't build this one this is themselves why did you sleep over it's the devil but you are watching TV till 2 A.M [Music] the poor therefore don't know what to do listen to brother Branham he is the one that water not to the devil he is the one that gets what [Applause] that's why you need to discipline him he's the one that get to a place sometime where he think he can do something about it not the devil when he does that shows God right out of the picture but when I can get rid of who oh God when I can get to a place where his water out of the way what then God can do it come over and do things that William Brad knows nothing but know nothing about it that is when God can use you that is when God can use any of you he can use who anybody when they can do utter get out of the way but as long as we got ourselves in the way then we cannot but the problem is not telling you to commit suicide he's telling you that you got you here and there is another you here he's saying this is the problem that you have in your life and this one need to have way but this one always block this one this one never get lazy he doesn't get tired he doesn't sleep no Slumber because he's God he's always alive he's a different material he comes from the Eternal in eternity you don't sleep everybody okay this is the one that gets you trouble brother Platinum is saying learn how to control this one when you are upset shut up just shut your mouth please and God sit quiet when your nerves begin to quieten you will hear him coming up sometime his way look powerless but they're powerful his way look weakness but they're powerful because this man wanna show off like go tell him this one said don't tell him you go tell him I'm sorry let me try to get somewhere let me try to get someone brother pranam was going to pray for someone everybody okay his step usually he carry his God everybody okay for some reason brother Brown I'm stopping the car left his gun God prepare it for the gun to stay there brother Branham get out of God I'm out of the car move on and get in the face when he got in the face it was somebody else property everybody okay he was a human property everybody okay when he gathered there brother Branham saw a bull coming up there was two William Marion Branham in operation everybody okay the one quick in the trigger amen look for the gun when he put the gun when you fail when the bank declined you when your application is rejected this man begin to get happy saying that's what I was waiting for everybody okay how many have seen they decline you and you push to prayer and they accept it why did they decline you the first time now the next time when you're giving people testimony you won't say I got you will say man we pray God gave it to us now the glory is going differently not towards you the glory now is going towards God how many times it happened in your life look like this no gun so this man fell everybody okay suddenly brother Branham relax everybody okay because as long as he get upset they will kill him everybody okay brother Brian I'm relaxed as brother Branham begin to relax somebody take over everybody okay and somebody look at the ball and say Brandon you trespass brother Branham me trespassing yeah it is the Bull's territory you enter without knocking at the door he looks powerless amen do you know what I'm saying I'm turning around he said Mr boo I'm sorry I step in your territory my intent is not to disturb you I am going over there because I'm crossing to pray for somebody how can a man talk to an animal which man was talking to an animal which man could talk to an animal an animal understanding human language can an animal understand human language they understand Sun everybody okay and when brother say I'm sorry I'm just going over there please creature of God you go back there and sit over there I'm going amen when brother Branham said that brother Branham said there was no fear on him because this man never get afraid amen when you have a situation that is tight in your life and like you are pressed here and you press there suddenly you hear a peace no it is him in other words he's taking everything under control [Applause] he's telling you move out of the way you will see you wanna get upset but you can have you ever seen that you feel like I don't know is this me or what how can this boy talk to me like that and you don't feel the urge anymore because he he's shutting everything down because a Son of God must be manifested because he's trying to look at your situation he's trying to assess your problem he's trying to resolve the problem not in your way according to God's Own plan learn to calm this man down that temper is not you it is your temper from your mother's side everybody okay tell that Tempest stop he said wait a minute you 20 years you always cause me trouble before you know it I have to repent all the time now I don't trust you you shut up stop that I'm not gonna say anything you sit quiet and two two hours you see that same person I'm sorry for the way I talked to you who told him to come and repent did you tell him anything did you tell him anything so which one is stressful come wait for repentance or fast and get upset and get your nerve tense out until you have to drink Motrin God is calling us to a higher level not to a life of stress not to a life of push and solve not to a life of a fight here fight there fight here no you did that for a long time learn to get your hand off learn to move out of the way learn to be quiet does that wait under will do whatever no matter how they push learn to be quiet and if God does appear the first time the second time he begins to build confidence in you now you begin to learn no no no no no twice I was quiet things happen well now you begin to learn more how to be quiet because now God want to see the sons and the daughter of God being what manifested people that act like God not only speaking like God by reacting like God brother Branham was attacked a man coming up I'm closing a man coming up to brother Prana and spit on him and the spirit hit him right here coming down there William Marion Branham who follow a police officer to shoot him that William Mayan Branham was dead Amen brother Branham stood up like this the police officer want to come he say police officer stay where you are and by the brown I'm just stood like this and sadly brother Branham begin to talk and say because you have defiled which brother Branham was talking everybody okay the men crumble like that without any move from Brother Branham without intervention of the police officer because Brother begin to understand how to let go and to let has water you are built as a God you are fashioned like a god you have been wired like God you just don't know God is reminding you you a god amen amen now it's time to wake up looked at every circumstances in your life get your hand off everybody okay take safe and hook that situation to Faith a letter handle when do you pray and stop when that man kicking when that man kicking you will feel a peace you will never worry this man never worries this main matter of fact it has a reason because he doesn't have reasoning whatever you tell him he just take it and he move on that's the way he operates he doesn't reason he only have faith everybody okay everybody okay that's what God wants us to be I'm mature God people that God is trusting in you that if I let him go I can sleep and I know if he fire shot he fired it legitimately amen amen if God ever said bring the cups tape for me to watch her did you react God look he said that was right for him to fire the shot because he behaved exactly like me because if not you don't know you can shoot the Son of God who's still in the earth in the in the world because you don't know how you should amen but if you are the seed of God and if you discipline this man this man will do everything to keep everything under control because he has his own preferences he wants people to love him he doesn't want people to rebuke him these men love everybody to like him if somebody doesn't like me would that like him one person he will forget the whole church he will begin to watch that person every day it's this man this man he will forget every people if it's one thousand people one doesn't like him he will worry about one he will worry about one that will kill him everybody okay the whole Kingdom will bow into him and only one man and because of that one man he they brought him down not you not you tell this person you're not here for this one I'm here for a mission let me fulfill God's mission in my life and move on the way God wants me to move I don't know you're missing I don't know your mission I don't know your mission I'm here for my own mission you were put here to be a god there are things in your life you need to talk to you there are things they are projecting your life you need to bring to pass I'm not talking about God bringing to pass I say you let's stop here ponderone we come back again let's stand I went 13 minutes over [Applause] amateur God amateur God I'm mature God they are little gods amen let's pray you pray on your own let me give you a few minutes as you play something soft because in our life there are things that need to die there's the area we don't have discipline and God is not here to put you down God is here to Build You Up so that you can realize who you are and you can do the work of God and be about the father's business and at that point you will be successful 100 percent because you're not following yourself anymore you begin to follow the guidance of God what he has planned for you what he's kept for you go ahead on your own way and begin to pray and then we will close it

bring each family each person each individual in this building to submit themselves to the will of God to realize how powerless we are how dependent we are built to be looking unto thee who is the author and the finisher of our faith so that Lord fathered these promises that you have promised to us what you have built us Lord father the very hour that we are so we can manifest the nature of God in our lives Lord because Lord we have used our brain we have used our intelligence we have used our human ability and we have failed so many times we found ourselves pushed to the corner we found ourselves where things are not working the way we plan but father there is a bigger plan than what we thought and that is a divine plan that you have for us in our life and father we pray that you come and help us Lord so that from this day forward we can give way to the inner men so that Lord father we can move from Victory to Victory from glory to glory until we can enjoy the very rest of God where our soul are resting is the one working because that is what he was built for father bless your children touch those that are sick in the body and afflicted father may you strengthen and heal
