[49:04] don't know it's the devil that has been
[49:06] fighting our system the new system
[49:08] either it's with the sound and also with
[49:12] the slide that we put in so I loaded all
[49:15] the quotes in a WhatsApp chat good so if
[49:18] you dare you should be able to access
[49:20] the code if there is any code that we
[49:23] read on Sunday that is not there and you
[49:25] still need the code just shoot me a text
[49:28] or something then I'll make sure I put
[49:30] it up so everybody in this church have
[49:33] their foundation not only me keeping it
[49:35] but I want you to keep it so you might
[49:38] help somebody else who have questioned
[49:39] why are you talking or fellowshipping if
[49:42] somebody brought up something you can
[49:44] say no this is what Brad Branham say not
[49:46] what brother Stephen say about what
[49:48] brother Branham say and this is what the
[49:50] Bible says that's where we want to get
[49:52] our foundation from amen so I will
[49:55] remember the question and answer on the
[49:58] 20 on the 19th of this month Lord's
[50:02] willing and I'm open if they are still
[50:05] questioned around what was preached on
[50:07] Sunday as uh or stand for the question
[50:10] in the box so when we on question and
[50:13] answer we can sit and expand it more and
[50:16] communicate more if somebody's missing
[50:18] something you can just ask and we make
[50:20] sure we all on the same page and we see
[50:24] the same vision and that will make
[50:26] things a whole lot easier amen amen

[57:55] the result is
[57:58] known very much to you
[58:00] and it's very very strange so I've been
[58:02] meditating on on things like this it's
[58:06] not just in one place but here and there
[58:09] and I've been wondering what will be the
[58:13] reason why people can go so far
[58:16] and turn around
[58:19] and I realized that it's nothing but one
[58:21] thing
[58:23] the foundation
[58:25] [Applause]
[58:28] yeah the foundation and the entry into
[58:31] the message
[58:35] so I've decided to preach on the
[58:37] foundation
[58:40] but the thing is
[58:43] we've come this far we find no fault we
[58:48] feel like going on we've come this far
[58:54] we find no fault we feel like going on
[59:01] though trials May praise us
[59:06] troubles all around
[59:11] we've come this far we find no fall we
[59:17] feel like going on how many feet are
[59:21] going on
[59:22] yes sir
[59:25] I don't know about you but I've come
[59:27] this far I find no fault I feel like
[59:33] going
[59:34] on I've come this far I find no fault I
[59:41] feel like going
[59:43] on
[59:45] though trials may press us
[59:54] I've come this far I find no fault I
[59:59] feel like going on
[1:00:03] yes sir
[1:00:05] I feel like going on
[1:00:08] [Applause]
[1:00:09] I find no fault
[1:00:13] if you came to sick Falls you find
[1:00:15] plenty
[1:00:18] and I was asking somebody I said hey man
[1:00:22] you put any prophet in this Bible under
[1:00:27] the radar and you are going to find
[1:00:30] false
[1:00:33] yeah
[1:00:36] because that's why we're looking for
[1:00:38] [Applause]
[1:00:40] and the devil will feed you with a lot
[1:00:43] of them
[1:00:46] amen
[1:00:47] but if you were looking for God
[1:00:51] I was looking for God and I found him
[1:00:55] and I found no fault
[1:00:57] and I feel like going on
[1:01:00] Hallelujah
[1:01:03] blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:01:06] you know what Brethren I want to share
[1:01:08] my personal testimony here
[1:01:11] uh I've got so many testimonies to keep
[1:01:14] me from preaching so just share the
[1:01:17] latest
[1:01:25] I was raised up in a Catholic Church
[1:01:29] Springfield as a little baby
[1:01:32] my mother told me they sprinkled me I
[1:01:35] wouldn't have known because I was a baby
[1:01:41] well I grew up and then I heard the
[1:01:43] gospel I repented
[1:01:45] and then I remember I was praying with
[1:01:48] the Pentecostal guy and he spoke in
[1:01:50] tongues and interpreted and I said I
[1:01:52] should go and look for my baptism as a
[1:01:55] baby was wrong so all I knew at the time
[1:01:59] was immersion
[1:02:01] so I looked and I got a Pentecostal
[1:02:04] person that immersed me in the titles of
[1:02:07] father son Holy Ghost
[1:02:09] almost immediately I picked a message
[1:02:12] book
[1:02:13] and it was titled doing God a service
[1:02:17] not according to his will
[1:02:22] and then I started reading it and the
[1:02:25] grammar was so horrible
[1:02:28] but there was something inside there
[1:02:31] I wasn't I wasn't looking for grammar
[1:02:35] I was reading it between their lives
[1:02:38] and then I saw that no I should have
[1:02:43] been baptized in the name of the Lord
[1:02:45] Jesus Christ
[1:02:46] [Music]
[1:02:47] but there was nobody anywhere that I
[1:02:51] knew that could do that for me
[1:02:54] it took a long while and then
[1:02:57] um brother we had a missionary I've
[1:03:00] given this testimony and some of you may
[1:03:02] have may now remember
[1:03:04] so I I wrote dear brother Branham
[1:03:10] I've just read your message book and I
[1:03:13] realized that my but my second baptism
[1:03:15] was also wrong but there's hardly
[1:03:19] anybody around me
[1:03:21] to re-baptize me in the name of the Lord
[1:03:23] Jesus Christ so after a while by Billy
[1:03:27] Paul wrote and told me problem was dead
[1:03:29] but the message is still alive and it's
[1:03:31] true
[1:03:33] so then a missionary came from Fort
[1:03:37] Wayne Indiana
[1:03:38] but Tommy Dillard who passed away
[1:03:41] recently
[1:03:42] so he came in and I was directed and I
[1:03:45] met him and had baptism I traveled miles
[1:03:48] and miles over from the northern part of
[1:03:51] my country yes for water baptism
[1:03:55] and with my mother and my nephew went
[1:03:58] and got baptized in the name of the Lord
[1:04:00] Jesus Christ
[1:04:01] and I have been preaching it ever since
[1:04:04] and even before but stronger along the
[1:04:08] line and for so many years
[1:04:11] now
[1:04:13] I read so many messages and listened to
[1:04:16] the prophet I never felt like worship
[1:04:19] Him brother
[1:04:22] never once
[1:04:24] every time the message brought me on my
[1:04:27] knees to love the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:04:32] so I I can't I just can't understand why
[1:04:37] people complain
[1:04:39] that we we talk about brother Brandon
[1:04:42] more than we talk about the Lord Jesus
[1:04:44] Christ
[1:04:46] who did the prophet reveal what did this
[1:04:51] message reveal
[1:04:53] did the mercy reveal William Branham
[1:04:58] did brother brother promote himself
[1:05:01] [Music]
[1:05:01] [Applause]
[1:05:02] was he was see somebody that was
[1:05:06] interested in a Showmanship
[1:05:11] [Music]
[1:05:13] self-glorification
[1:05:16] I never once ever saw anything to even
[1:05:22] suggest
[1:05:25] oh my goodness
[1:05:28] so I find it so hard
[1:05:31] to understand why people
[1:05:34] can do what they're doing
[1:05:39] these same people
[1:05:41] are blaming others for saying that
[1:05:44] prophets don't make mistakes
[1:05:47] all right now these same people get
[1:05:51] around and say why should the prophet
[1:05:54] blah blah make mistakes
[1:05:57] did they hear me why did you
[1:06:00] [Music]
[1:06:02] prophets make mistakes
[1:06:06] yeah
[1:06:08] you can tell me prophets don't make
[1:06:10] mistakes prophets make mistakes all
[1:06:13] right
[1:06:13] then prophets make mistakes
[1:06:16] so why should he make mistakes
[1:06:20] so what do you want him to do
[1:06:24] is he he shouldn't make mistakes
[1:06:28] and yet he makes mistakes
[1:06:32] and you don't understand it
[1:06:36] well our Brethren yes we don't even have
[1:06:39] to waste our time
[1:06:42] listening to anything that will cause us
[1:06:45] to earn
[1:06:47] the Bible says my son
[1:06:50] sees from listening to anything that
[1:06:53] will cause you to earn
[1:06:57] yes
[1:06:59] therefore
[1:07:00] our commission is not to preach any man
[1:07:03] no
[1:07:06] we are commissioned to preach the gospel
[1:07:10] don't let us waste our time trying to
[1:07:13] defend anything
[1:07:15] this message is a lion
[1:07:18] you don't need to defend a liar
[1:07:22] that's releasing from the cage
[1:07:25] and the lion will defend himself
[1:07:31] and the sad thing is
[1:07:34] the men they are butchering
[1:07:37] the man they are destroying is not even
[1:07:40] here to defend himself
[1:07:45] oh yeah so
[1:07:47] what's the point in doing that
[1:08:03] praise the Lord
[1:08:05] so shall we thrown our feet as we turn
[1:08:07] quickly to our Bible and we read from
[1:08:09] Luke chapter 6. Luke chapter 6 and from
[1:08:14] verse 46 to 49.
[1:08:16] the Lord Jesus told so many parables and
[1:08:19] he made so many powerful statements and
[1:08:23] they are very relevant
[1:08:25] especially to our time
[1:08:31] I wish we had a long time to be able to
[1:08:34] not that I'm here to teach
[1:08:37] know that we have a very solid pastor
[1:08:42] and no breastfeeding for a while and
[1:08:45] thank God
[1:08:47] he's had a thought yeah
[1:08:50] solidly and within a short time frame by
[1:08:55] God's grace being able to secure such a
[1:08:58] nice sanctuary
[1:08:59] I was reading where David was saying my
[1:09:02] son Solomon
[1:09:04] the house of God must be magnificent
[1:09:08] yes sir
[1:09:10] [Music]
[1:09:12] so you know it's not wrong to have a
[1:09:15] nice Tabernacle
[1:09:20] yes sir
[1:09:22] but the beauty of the church is the
[1:09:24] character of the people we know that
[1:09:27] amen so you look chapter 6
[1:09:31] and from verse 49 Lord
[1:09:34] as we open your word we are not worthy
[1:09:37] but you are worthy so we depend on you
[1:09:41] to help us to anoint us
[1:09:44] to Quicken the word unto us
[1:09:47] I yield my spirit to you even as I yield
[1:09:50] my audience to you
[1:09:53] now Lord take over the service is yours
[1:09:56] because the people are the purchase of
[1:09:59] your blood
[1:10:00] so help us Lord to draw closer to you
[1:10:05] through your word in the name of Jesus
[1:10:08] Christ Our Savior amen amen
[1:10:12] for Luke 6 says excuse me from verse 46
[1:10:15] then there came a reasoning among them
[1:10:19] which of the of them should be
[1:10:24] greatest
[1:10:27] no no no
[1:10:29] that's not God has the purpose for me
[1:10:32] reading that
[1:10:36] yeah maybe some were struggling over
[1:10:39] leadership you know
[1:10:47] yes sir
[1:10:53] uh Isaiah chapter 6 from ah what is this
[1:10:58] look
[1:11:02] chapter 6 46 down
[1:11:06] Jesus speaking
[1:11:10] why call ye me Lord Lord and do not the
[1:11:13] things which I see
[1:11:21] whosoever cometh to me and heareth my
[1:11:26] sayings and do with them
[1:11:29] I will show you to whom he is like
[1:11:33] he is like a man which built an house
[1:11:37] and dig deep
[1:11:39] and laid the foundation on a rock
[1:11:45] and when the flood came the flood would
[1:11:49] definitely come
[1:11:52] the stream beat vehemently upon the
[1:11:57] house
[1:11:59] and could not shake it why amen
[1:12:04] if you are founded on the right
[1:12:07] foundation I don't care what
[1:12:09] denominational storms I don't care what
[1:12:12] kind of Doctrine and storms I don't care
[1:12:15] what will be blowing you will still be
[1:12:18] standing
[1:12:20] standing solid on the Rock Foundation
[1:12:24] yes sir he could not shake it for it was
[1:12:28] fun DED
[1:12:29] upon a rock
[1:12:32] Hallelujah
[1:12:34] but he that heareth and doeth not is
[1:12:39] like a man that without a found a
[1:12:42] foundation
[1:12:43] build an house upon the Earth against
[1:12:46] which the stream did beat vehemently
[1:12:50] and immediately it fell and the wind of
[1:12:54] the house
[1:12:56] was great
[1:13:00] so he says through Isaiah 28 16
[1:13:07] Jehovah God says Isaiah 28 16 therefore
[1:13:12] thus saith the Lord God
[1:13:14] behold I lay in Zion a foundation
[1:13:19] a stone a tried Stone a precious
[1:13:23] Cornerstone a sure Foundation
[1:13:26] he that believer shall not make haste
[1:13:32] a sure Foundation
[1:13:35] a rock Foundation
[1:13:38] Jesus our lord was working with the
[1:13:41] disciples in Matthew 16.
[1:13:44] and that's the last one I read before
[1:13:47] you sit and I keep standing
[1:13:52] amen
[1:13:54] oh so you pray for me Hallelujah
[1:14:01] Hallelujah
[1:14:03] song is ringing in my heart I'm standing
[1:14:07] on the rock
[1:14:09] I'm standing on the rock I'm standing on
[1:14:14] the rock Christ Jesus is the wrong
[1:14:19] yes sir from verse 30 when Jesus came
[1:14:23] into the course of caesarea Philippi he
[1:14:27] asked his disciples say whom do men say
[1:14:29] that I the son of man am
[1:14:34] I am
[1:14:36] and they said some say
[1:14:38] that thou art John the Baptist some
[1:14:41] Elias and others Jeremiah's or one of
[1:14:45] the prophets it is very easy to be
[1:14:48] saying what somebody else is saying
[1:14:53] oh yeah sometimes we live off on other
[1:14:57] people's testimonies
[1:15:03] that's building on on
[1:15:09] boarding on or what
[1:15:12] no in Sinking sin
[1:15:19] they said some say thou art John the
[1:15:22] Baptist some Elias and otherwise others
[1:15:25] Jeremiah so one of the prophets is
[1:15:28] heaven to them but whom say ye that I am
[1:15:31] what's your personal revelation of who I
[1:15:35] am
[1:15:36] tell me who do you say I am
[1:15:40] who do you say these messages
[1:15:45] who do you say it is revealing
[1:15:49] [Music]
[1:15:55] and Simon Peter and said said Thou Art
[1:15:59] the Messiah
[1:16:01] the Christ
[1:16:04] the sun of the Living God
[1:16:09] Jesus answered and said unto him blessed
[1:16:12] art thou Simon by Jonah
[1:16:15] for Flesh and Blood have not revealed
[1:16:20] unto thee but my Father which is in
[1:16:24] heaven
[1:16:25] and I say also unto thee that thou art
[1:16:29] Peter
[1:16:31] and Upon This Rock
[1:16:35] I will board my church
[1:16:39] and the gates of hell
[1:16:42] shall not Prevail against it
[1:16:46] the prophet said the case of hair would
[1:16:49] definitely fight
[1:16:51] but I will not Prevail against him
[1:16:55] and I will give unto thee the Keys of
[1:17:00] the Kingdom of Heaven and whatsoever
[1:17:02] thou shall bind on Earth shall be bound
[1:17:06] in heaven whatsoever thou shall lose on
[1:17:09] Earth
[1:17:10] shall be loosed in heaven
[1:17:12] then church he his disciples that they
[1:17:16] should not they should tell no man that
[1:17:18] he was Jesus
[1:17:21] Christ may the Lord bless his word as we
[1:17:25] take our sins
