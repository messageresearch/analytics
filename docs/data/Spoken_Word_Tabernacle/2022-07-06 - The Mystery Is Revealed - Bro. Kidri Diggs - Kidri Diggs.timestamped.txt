[23:17] i had my eyes closed
[23:19] you want to do it right there
[23:21] they praise reports
[23:23] okay go ahead i just want to give a few
[23:25] testimonies um first one a few couple
[23:28] months ago my voice just started hurting
[23:30] out of nowhere it wasn't really hurting
[23:31] it really just started off as a ringing
[23:33] sound
[23:34] and it just kept on getting worse and
[23:36] worse and worse and we're not saying
[23:38] like if that's when it started hurting
[23:40] then it'll crack like i was like just
[23:42] randomly i'm pretty sure y'all heard it
[23:43] when i was singing the last couple of
[23:45] times
[23:46] um there was a line here when i forgot
[23:48] the preacher's name but um i came here
[23:51] on the line to pray for my voice because
[23:52] it was like it's been already it's
[23:54] already been a month and it was
[23:56] just hurting and i prayed about it
[23:58] um the pastor prayed about it um
[24:01] now like i don't know i like i just
[24:03] stopped thinking about it and now i just
[24:05] realized that it stopped hurting no more
[24:06] my voice isn't hurting anymore
[24:08] everything's good the second testimony
[24:10] was
[24:11] saturday when i was driving back home my
[24:13] check engine light came on i was like
[24:14] god i'm not trying to pay like go to the
[24:17] auto shop or do none of this so i just
[24:19] prayed about it and i believed on the
[24:20] spoken word
[24:21] sunday when i was uh i came here my
[24:24] check engine light was still on
[24:26] i was i still prayed about i still
[24:27] believe i was like lazarus rose like
[24:30] after like three days so i'm like
[24:33] well i started the same god
[24:35] um and monday when i was going to the
[24:37] gym i turned on my car i wasn't even
[24:39] thinking about it i just seen the check
[24:40] edge line was
[24:42] off i was like praise god he did exactly
[24:44] what i expected him to do
[24:46] and the last testimony was
[24:48] i think
[24:49] i've been trying to get my passport for
[24:51] now like two years but they can't we
[24:53] kept on going back and forth back and
[24:54] forth back and forth back and forth
[24:56] and
[24:58] the last time i applied was in january
[25:00] usually it takes at most two months to
[25:02] get your passport first time we were
[25:04] going back and forth for like a year we
[25:06] just stopped they sent our paper back
[25:07] the money went to waste second time we
[25:09] just started going back and forth the
[25:10] expert dna test proof of residency proof
[25:13] of that i live with my mom proof that my
[25:15] mom is my mom this night and the third
[25:17] um
[25:19] then
[25:20] what last time then like the last letter
[25:22] they sent
[25:23] my mom uh she didn't want to open it i
[25:26] didn't want to open it because like what
[25:27] are they going to ask now because we've
[25:29] sent nearly everything we could think of
[25:31] even the stuff like we couldn't even
[25:32] think of we sent it because we just
[25:35] didn't want to go back and forth with
[25:36] them
[25:37] um so the last step they said was like
[25:39] um just send your pictures because
[25:41] everything you have is already
[25:43] um is already in line so we sent that
[25:46] two weeks later i finally got my
[25:47] password after two years of trying so i
[25:49] just want to praise the lord about that
[25:59] amen
[26:01] be careful now because you put it in the
[26:03] drawer and it'll expire
[26:05] mine always did
[26:08] just right there laying in the drawer
[26:09] it'll go

[51:20] ephesians chapter 3
[51:23] ephesians 3
[51:26] by the grace of god
[51:32] amen
[51:35] you know sometimes you have to laugh at
[51:37] the devil
[51:40] because it comes with
[51:41] he comes with those wild attacks
[51:47] wild attacks like we don't know who we
[51:48] are
[51:52] you know i i i i go to the gym i go to a
[51:55] gym uh of a of a boxing trainer
[51:59] and one thing about a professional boxer
[52:02] his skill set is a little different
[52:05] because he can throw and defend himself
[52:08] and if you come wildly at him he'll
[52:10] remind you keep your hands up
[52:13] and sometimes i believe god allows the
[52:15] enemy to come wildly at us so we can
[52:18] keep our guards up
[52:20] you know this is not a time to fret or
[52:23] to be afraid
[52:24] but to know god give he he's given us
[52:27] something
[52:28] hallelujah that we can stand and fight
[52:30] with
[52:31] and it's truth amen
[52:33] amen if you have your bibles let's turn
[52:34] to ephesians chapter 3
[52:37] hallelujah
[52:39] ephesians chapter 3 verse 1.
[52:42] the bible says for this cause i paul the
[52:45] prisoner of jesus christ for you
[52:47] gentiles if ye have heard of
[52:50] the dispensation of the grace of god
[52:52] which has given me
[52:54] to you word
[52:55] how that by revelation
[52:58] he made known unto me the mystery as i
[53:01] wrote before in few words whereby
[53:05] when ye read ye may understand my
[53:08] knowledge
[53:09] in the mystery of christ
[53:13] see listen to paul
[53:14] paul is saying you're going to
[53:16] understand the mystery
[53:19] the mystery is no longer hidden
[53:22] it's going to be revealed
[53:24] by my ministry
[53:27] amen hallelujah
[53:29] he says which
[53:31] in other ages was not made known unto
[53:34] the sons of men
[53:36] as is now revealed unto his holy
[53:39] apostles and prophets by the spirit that
[53:43] the gentiles should be fellow heirs and
[53:47] of the same body and partakers of his
[53:50] promise in christ
[53:52] by the gospel
[53:54] whereof i am made a minister according
[53:56] to the gift of the grace of god given
[53:58] unto me by the effectual working of his
[54:02] power
[54:03] amen let's go to revelations chapter 10
[54:06] verse
[54:08] 7
[54:09] hallelujah
[54:11] revelations 10 and 7.
[54:15] familiar verse of scripture
[54:17] but the bible says
[54:19] but in the days of the voice of the
[54:21] seventh angel when he shall begin to
[54:24] sound the mystery of god should be
[54:28] finished
[54:30] that's why it's very important to know
[54:32] this voice
[54:34] because this voice is finishing a
[54:36] mystery
[54:39] he said as he have declared to his
[54:41] servants the prophets amen may the lord
[54:44] have blessed you reading of his word you
[54:45] can have your seats
[54:48] amen
[54:49] you know by by the grace of god
[54:52] uh i want to use for a subject the
[54:54] mystery is revealed
[54:57] the mystery is revealed hallelujah
[55:00] you know if we would think of the hour
[55:03] we in
[55:04] the mystery of god
[55:06] and we know our prophet he came and
[55:08] preached a message the mystery of christ
[55:10] revealed
[55:12] but one thing we got to understand that
[55:14] anything that is a mystery is hidden
[55:18] hallelujah anything that is a mystery
[55:21] i'm i'm about to say something that is
[55:23] going to kind of catch you off guard but
[55:26] anything that you receive as a mystery
[55:29] is still in darkness
[55:32] hallelujah so if you believe this
[55:36] message to be a mystery you're living in
[55:38] darkness
[55:40] so that's why hallelujah god sent a
[55:42] prophet to bring us into the marvelous
[55:45] light
[55:47] because paul said these things have been
[55:49] hidden from all ages but paul said i've
[55:52] come to reveal a mystery
[55:55] i've come to bring you into the light
[55:57] hallelujah and i love how the prophet of
[56:00] god our prophet malachi 4 when it came
[56:03] down to it he said i preached what paul
[56:06] preached
[56:08] hallelujah and paul said i'm no longer
[56:11] preaching a mystery but i'm preaching
[56:13] the revealing of god
[56:15] he said i'll show you a mystery
[56:17] hallelujah if you show me something it's
[56:19] no longer hidden it's revealed
[56:22] hallelujah but churchill we look and we
[56:25] we understand hallelujah the times we're
[56:28] in the bible says in the days of the
[56:31] voice
[56:33] the mystery of god shall be finished
[56:37] that's why we are not looking for
[56:39] another voice
[56:43] if you're looking for another voice
[56:45] you're still in darkness
[56:47] because you're living under a mystery
[56:50] and if anything is a mystery to you that
[56:54] mean it's hidden
[56:58] we are in the last days
[57:00] and if we are proclaiming to be
[57:02] abraham's seed hallelujah god said unto
[57:06] abraham under the spirit under the
[57:09] spirit of obedience
[57:11] i will not hide anything from abraham
[57:16] so faith is not a mystery
[57:21] faith is a revealing
[57:28] [Music]
[57:30] but as we look church
[57:32] and we read the scripture
[57:35] god hallelujah
[57:36] he talked in parables and we go to mark
[57:39] the fourth chapter and he began to talk
[57:42] about a soul without the soul and he
[57:45] began to sow on certain kinds of ground
[57:48] and he said some fell by the wayside
[57:51] holly some fell among thorns and and
[57:54] some were choked out and and on and on
[57:56] he said but some fell on good ground
[57:59] hungaria and that that fell on good
[58:02] ground hallelujah it came forth
[58:05] and if it came forth that means the life
[58:08] inside the sea was no longer hidden
[58:12] that means the life inside the seed was
[58:14] no longer a mystery because it fell on
[58:17] good ground
[58:19] now holy we know that the seed was the
[58:21] word of god
[58:25] hallelujah but the word of god fell
[58:27] among thorns and it was choked up
[58:32] now people are presenting that there was
[58:34] something wrong with the word no
[58:36] it's the ground
[58:38] it's the ground that couldn't contain
[58:40] it's the ground that couldn't let loose
[58:43] the
[58:45] [Music]
[58:48] mystery there's nothing wrong with the
[58:51] word
[58:52] holly but look
[58:53] look when jesus began to talk to them he
[58:56] he preached and he began to speak in in
[58:59] mystery form and then the disciples they
[59:01] came and they said lord why do you speak
[59:04] to them like that
[59:05] why do you talk to them in parables and
[59:08] jesus said it's very plain because it
[59:10] ain't for them
[59:15] so for those who don't understand this
[59:17] message
[59:18] jesus said it very plainly
[59:21] it's not for them
[59:23] they'll hear it but they won't
[59:25] understand it
[59:26] they'll see it but they still don't know
[59:28] what they're looking at why because they
[59:31] are in darkness
[59:32] [Applause]
[59:37] don't get mad at us because he gave us
[59:40] ears to hear
[59:43] [Applause]
[59:47] see this message to a true believer is
[59:50] not in mystery format
[59:52] it's a revealing
[59:55] it's an open book
[59:57] it's a manifestation of something what
[1:00:00] is it is christ being revealed
[1:00:03] [Music]
[1:00:06] and for those who can't see that they're
[1:00:09] looking for something else
[1:00:10] proving they are only in darkness
[1:00:14] [Music]
[1:00:22] listen let's catch it
[1:00:24] let's catch a church
[1:00:26] he said why are you preaching them in
[1:00:27] parables
[1:00:28] he says not giving it to them to
[1:00:30] understand
[1:00:31] holy and it looks like you look at
[1:00:33] what's going on now
[1:00:35] people are trying to take the message
[1:00:37] and twist it around honey when we can
[1:00:40] hear plainly what he was saying
[1:00:42] plainly
[1:00:44] why because it's not a mystery to us
[1:00:46] god gave us ears to hear hallelujah he
[1:00:49] gave us eyes to see what are we seeing
[1:00:52] the revealing of god
[1:00:55] because whenever a prophet came he came
[1:00:58] to reveal god's mind
[1:01:00] samuel god's mind hallelujah came to
[1:01:03] reveal god's mind every prophet
[1:01:05] hallelujah that ever came they had what
[1:01:09] god thoughts were
[1:01:11] what were they doing they were unreal
[1:01:14] revealing the mystery of god
[1:01:22] oh my look
[1:01:25] look he said it's given unto you to
[1:01:27] understand these things
[1:01:29] to understand he said whereby when ye
[1:01:32] read you may understand my knowledge
[1:01:35] in the mystery of christ but then
[1:01:38] hallelujah the prophet comes and he says
[1:01:41] i'll show you a greater mystery
[1:01:44] christ in you
[1:01:46] the hope of glory
[1:01:48] see that's what everybody's missing
[1:01:50] they're trying to put it on brother
[1:01:51] branham but no put it on me
[1:01:55] put it on you
[1:01:56] because the mystery is not in one man
[1:01:59] the revealing of god is in a body
[1:02:01] the revealing of god is in the people
[1:02:04] i'll show you a mystery hallelujah when
[1:02:06] you lay hands on somebody hallelujah
[1:02:09] it's the revelation of jehovah rapha
[1:02:12] living in you
[1:02:14] when you bless somebody let's just say
[1:02:17] financially it's the revelation of
[1:02:19] jehovah jireh inside of you
[1:02:23] [Music]
[1:02:25] the mystery is no longer just a book the
[1:02:28] mystery is the revealing of a person
[1:02:32] that's why the holy ghost can't be a
[1:02:34] tone holly it can't be just a gift holly
[1:02:38] it's a person
[1:02:40] [Music]
[1:02:43] that's where denominations
[1:02:45] get twisted up holly they try to make it
[1:02:48] a gift or a dust or that no it's a
[1:02:51] person
[1:02:52] [Music]
[1:02:54] that's why the prophet came
[1:02:56] to reveal the person of christ
[1:02:59] because billy graham couldn't do that
[1:03:01] all robbers couldn't do that and all the
[1:03:04] other reformers before them couldn't do
[1:03:06] that hollywood that's why beyond the
[1:03:08] curtain of time brother brother was
[1:03:10] saying real problems could be here
[1:03:15] he said yeah paul's gonna be here
[1:03:18] he said well i preached what he preached
[1:03:20] and everybody that heard him say that
[1:03:23] everybody that understood what the
[1:03:25] prophet preached
[1:03:26] up in heaven they said we're resting on
[1:03:30] that
[1:03:31] [Applause]
[1:03:33] somebody ought to say tonight i see it
[1:03:36] i see it
[1:03:38] i see what god was talking about i see
[1:03:41] it it's been revealed god is in me he's
[1:03:45] in you i see it
[1:03:52] listen
[1:03:53] listen
[1:03:54] church
[1:03:56] see the whole purpose of god
[1:03:59] was to reveal himself
[1:04:03] god wanted to have relations
[1:04:05] so he had to reveal himself there was so
[1:04:08] much in god god was so mysterious you
[1:04:11] know what he did he allowed the fall why
[1:04:14] so he could reveal himself
[1:04:16] [Music]
[1:04:20] he allowed sisters to get sick why so he
[1:04:23] could show the power healing
[1:04:29] that prayer hadn't left with the prophet
[1:04:31] with prayers now hallelujah and many
[1:04:33] members pride
[1:04:38] i'll show you a mystery hello the
[1:04:40] message didn't leave with the prophet
[1:04:42] the message is still behind skin
[1:04:47] that's why i'm not looking for another
[1:04:49] voice the voice is inside of us
[1:04:52] [Music]
[1:04:56] because he said in the days of the voice
[1:04:58] when he shall begin to sound the mystery
[1:05:00] of god will be finished
[1:05:05] there's nothing else coming after this
[1:05:07] voice
[1:05:08] but an unveiling of god
[1:05:11] [Music]
[1:05:11] [Applause]
[1:05:13] [Music]
[1:05:16] and you're sitting
[1:05:18] if you're sitting on the ministry who's
[1:05:21] always preaching in mystery format that
[1:05:24] means he's preaching darkness
[1:05:27] [Music]
[1:05:30] why would you want to sit on the
[1:05:31] ministry you can't understand
[1:05:35] hebrews
[1:05:36] hebrews says
[1:05:38] hollywood
[1:05:40] he's a reward of those that diligently
[1:05:42] seek him
[1:05:43] and to get anything from god you must
[1:05:46] first believe and know that he is see
[1:05:50] it's a revealing
[1:05:52] he is he is what a healer he is he is
[1:05:56] what a savior he is what a mighty
[1:05:59] conqueror he is a lord
[1:06:02] he is the one that triumphs he is never
[1:06:06] defeated
[1:06:08] you must first in real life he is that's
[1:06:11] why this brother could say satan i know
[1:06:14] it's just a wild attack but i know my
[1:06:16] god is greater
[1:06:21] that's why you can look at the doctrine
[1:06:23] and say i will not receive this death
[1:06:26] until satan get off my wife honey rise
[1:06:29] up
[1:06:38] he is the resurrection
[1:06:42] [Applause]
[1:06:46] mother and mary
[1:06:47] was speaking in mystery for me
[1:06:49] but jesus said i'ma make this thing
[1:06:51] clear
[1:06:52] holy the mystery of christ is standing
[1:06:54] with the mystery of god standing right
[1:06:56] before you she said lord if you was here
[1:06:59] my brother wouldn't die
[1:07:01] jesus said let me make this thing clear
[1:07:03] to you your brother ain't dead he sleeps
[1:07:08] but this she said lord
[1:07:10] even now
[1:07:11] whatever you ask the father god will do
[1:07:14] it holy she said but i know he'll rise
[1:07:17] again in the day of the resurrection she
[1:07:20] said he god said let me reveal something
[1:07:22] to you
[1:07:25] you waiting on a resurrection let me
[1:07:27] show you the opening of the word he
[1:07:30] looks at her and he says i am the
[1:07:32] resurrection
[1:07:34] i am the mystery of christ revealed i am
[1:07:38] god almighty revealed and it is finished
[1:07:42] there is no other art of me
[1:07:45] [Applause]
[1:07:47] she always came to open the words
[1:07:55] he always came to give the people a
[1:07:58] closer understanding of who he is
[1:08:03] and now for preachers
[1:08:05] and different people
[1:08:06] to try to take that away from us
[1:08:10] and look for another
[1:08:12] they put us back in darkness
[1:08:20] because what is a mystery
[1:08:22] i ain't gonna be too much longer i hope
[1:08:23] you all ain't looking for no punch lines
[1:08:26] i ain't got no punch lines or some
[1:08:28] special quote they're gonna make you say
[1:08:30] oh ah no find your place in what i'm
[1:08:32] preaching

[1:08:35] and become the word
[1:08:37] and see if god will visit this church
[1:08:39] tonight
[1:08:41] [Music]
[1:08:47] what is a mystery
[1:08:49] this is why it's very important
[1:08:51] for us to understand what god brought in
[1:08:53] our day
[1:08:55] this is way beyond skin color
[1:08:57] [Applause]
[1:09:00] [Music]
[1:09:01] people stuck on the surface it's
[1:09:03] something deeper
[1:09:07] god used a man that couldn't mess it up
[1:09:13] who was simple enough just to preach
[1:09:16] what god put in his heart
[1:09:18] and not try to make it all mysterious
[1:09:21] because god never wanted to be
[1:09:23] mysterious
[1:09:24] he wanted to be revealed
[1:09:28] god was tired of being in hiding
[1:09:30] god was tired of being all by himself
[1:09:33] so he let satan do what he do hallelujah
[1:09:35] and satan said i'm gonna mess with eve
[1:09:37] i'm gonna do this i'mma get in creation
[1:09:39] and god say dummy what you about to do
[1:09:42] you're about to start the powers of
[1:09:44] redemption
[1:09:51] satan thought he was smarter than god
[1:09:53] but god used his own enemy to unlock his
[1:09:57] mystery
[1:10:00] the devil is a tool in god's hands
[1:10:03] and if he's messing with you all he's
[1:10:06] doing is unlocking the mystery in your
[1:10:08] life
[1:10:09] all he's doing is unlocking a mystery
[1:10:15] you ought to tell the devil i'm tired of
[1:10:18] being in hiding
[1:10:19] it's time for me to be unlocked
[1:10:30] sorry
[1:10:32] say you say well i'm gonna mess with eve
[1:10:33] i'm gonna mess with his wife and god is
[1:10:35] saying all you're gonna do is unlock my
[1:10:37] attributes
[1:10:41] dumb devil
[1:10:46] dumb devil
[1:10:49] all he's doing is giving us a testimony
[1:10:52] [Applause]
[1:10:57] [Music]

[1:13:02] in the trunk roll he about six two six
[1:13:05] one rolled around with him for three
[1:13:07] hours in the trunk

[1:13:16] nightmare on that boy
[1:13:18] but then church hallelujah they got to a
[1:13:20] place to where the car wasn't moving
[1:13:22] because they was watching it to see if
[1:13:23] the police were coming home and he was

[1:14:32] [Applause]
[1:14:39] your life has to unlock a mystery
[1:14:42] church
[1:14:43] in the miss holly in the midst when it
[1:14:46] looked like he should be losing his mind
[1:14:48] because the robbers were riding around
[1:14:50] with his son and he in the trunk god
[1:14:53] gave him peace
[1:14:57] [Music]
[1:15:02] then finally last time
[1:15:04] they popped the truck
[1:15:06] they told him get out
[1:15:07] he says look
[1:15:09] we're not going to do anything to you
[1:15:10] now let's make this real clear
[1:15:13] when the militants catch you hardly
[1:15:15] when they carjack you it's usually not a
[1:15:18] good ending
[1:15:19] they'll take you to the field put a
[1:15:20] bullet in your head and it's done
[1:15:22] but because matthew was persistent
[1:15:29] because he had his son with him
[1:15:30] hallelujah it was a different story
[1:15:33] hallelujah and now holly he tells him he
[1:15:36] says get out the car here's your money
[1:15:39] back
[1:15:41] here's your cards back
[1:15:44] here's your wallet back
[1:15:46] now what we want you to do we want you
[1:15:48] to go in that field and pray for 10
[1:15:51] minutes
[1:15:56] when was the last time the devil told
[1:15:58] you to go pray while i escaped
[1:16:05] he knew who he was dealing with
[1:16:09] [Applause]
[1:16:12] he said you go pray you're a man of god
[1:16:14] you go on that field and pray for 10
[1:16:16] minutes and after you finish praying go
[1:16:18] up there to the corner store and call
[1:16:20] you a ride while we leave
[1:16:23] so he went in the field he prayed called
[1:16:26] his wife came back to the camp meeting
[1:16:28] and told his testimony
[1:16:32] all the devil is doing is giving us a
[1:16:34] testimony
[1:16:41] [Music]
[1:16:43] [Applause]
[1:16:48] [Music]
[1:16:49] don't let your life
[1:16:51] be locked up under mystery but there's a
[1:16:54] revealing god is trying to get out of
[1:16:56] here
[1:17:03] let's take mystery for a second
[1:17:06] now this this is the youth leader
[1:17:08] because he was the one orchestrating
[1:17:10] everything and the devil said i can stop
[1:17:12] him i can stop the whole meeting
[1:17:16] but when the young people heard about
[1:17:17] what god did for him it was one girl
[1:17:20] hallelujah she was she lost her eyesight
[1:17:22] hallelujah and they said well she got
[1:17:24] diabetes and she needed more insulin and
[1:17:27] all these things that wasn't the case
[1:17:29] her body had too much insulin what it
[1:17:31] was is at the age of 15 she had
[1:17:34] cataracts
[1:17:35] so the doctor said okay it's going to
[1:17:37] take two weeks for us to operate she
[1:17:38] said no i can't miss the camp meeting so
[1:17:41] she started praying then all of a sudden
[1:17:43] a opening came up a week early and they
[1:17:46] operated hallelujah a week early and she
[1:17:48] was in a camp meeting with one eye
[1:17:53] one eye praising god what i worshipping
[1:17:57] god thanking god for opening the door
[1:18:00] why did the devil attack her eyes
[1:18:02] because she starts seeing salvation
[1:18:08] you watch how the enemy attacks your
[1:18:10] life he's trying to strip you from your
[1:18:12] power
[1:18:14] [Music]
[1:18:16] you watch how he attacks
[1:18:20] oh wow attacks
[1:18:24] and from there a young man heard about
[1:18:27] he he fell down the stairs he took all
[1:18:29] the ligaments in his knee he was on
[1:18:31] crutches and he had a cast on but he
[1:18:34] heard about this girl's testimony
[1:18:36] receiving her sight he ripped the cast
[1:18:38] off threw the keg that came down and he
[1:18:40] started walking back up those same
[1:18:42] stairs
[1:18:46] all of it started with the youth leader
[1:18:48] getting contact
[1:18:52] [Applause]
[1:18:57] so maybe the first miracle this week
[1:18:59] started in your house
[1:19:01] and god's getting the whole church
[1:19:03] preparing for something special
[1:19:06] hallelujah because he said holy without
[1:19:08] a shepherd the sheep was scattered so a
[1:19:11] lot of times god will take the shepherd
[1:19:13] through it first to give you an example
[1:19:15] to give you a testimony and by his
[1:19:17] testimony we all will overcome
[1:19:22] because if god did in the shepherd's
[1:19:24] life i got a right to experience the
[1:19:27] same grace
[1:19:30] so you get ready for your testimony
[1:19:41] i don't get envious when god do things
[1:19:43] in my pastor's life
[1:19:45] i pay attention
[1:19:47] i say lord you do you bless them like
[1:19:49] that praise god
[1:19:50] [Applause]
[1:19:52] that's the ministry i set up under
[1:19:54] praise god their blessings on blessings
[1:19:57] every time i turn around see blessings
[1:20:00] blessings every time i turn around i say
[1:20:04] blessings or blessings
[1:20:08] come on somebody
[1:20:11] we are the bride of christ
[1:20:16] we're not living under the mystery
[1:20:19] we are the revealing of this message
[1:20:22] [Music]
[1:20:27] listen let's make it clear
[1:20:30] what is a mystery i want to show you why
[1:20:33] it's very important
[1:20:35] not to be oh my that was deep i didn't
[1:20:38] understand it no that ain't what we want
[1:20:40] that ain't what we want
[1:20:43] that ain't what we want
[1:20:45] i don't want to sit up under somebody so
[1:20:47] deep i don't know what he talking about
[1:20:49] because god didn't use the messenger
[1:20:51] like that
[1:20:53] he used somebody playing
[1:20:55] hallelujah
[1:20:56] or kentucky hillbilly
[1:21:04] eating beans and onions and cornbread
[1:21:08] somebody who couldn't mess it up
[1:21:12] but nowadays these eight angels and
[1:21:15] eight and a half angels and seven seven
[1:21:18] and a half angels and all these people
[1:21:20] that are not even in the scripture
[1:21:24] but we got scripture
[1:21:26] in the days of the voice of the seventh
[1:21:29] angel not the eighth angel
[1:21:31] not the eighth and a half
[1:21:37] listen if they not following the seventh
[1:21:40] angel who they following
[1:21:42] [Music]
[1:21:43] the bible don't speak of another
[1:21:47] [Music]
[1:21:49] if they looking for another angel
[1:21:50] they're in darkness
[1:21:53] because he said when he began to sound
[1:21:55] the mystery of god will be finished
[1:21:58] [Applause]
[1:22:03] i ain't got time to argue whether the
[1:22:05] message is true or not
[1:22:10] i judge about my life

[1:22:15] and what i am now
[1:22:17] what this message made me to be honest

[1:22:58] to be under a mystery
[1:23:01] no you're looking for the revealing
[1:23:05] you're looking for the unfolding of god
[1:23:08] because he got tired of being a mystery
[1:23:12] listen a mystery anything that is kept
[1:23:16] secret
[1:23:24] and the message is no longer secret

[1:23:33] look
[1:23:34] it says something uh anything that is
[1:23:36] kept secret

[1:23:44] branham hallelujah
[1:23:45] god came and he began to break down the
[1:23:48] godheads
[1:23:51] stuff that they knew nothing about for
[1:23:52] years
[1:23:54] god used a man to put it together holly
[1:23:56] say it's not regards her father son the
[1:23:59] holy ghost is the manifestation of one
[1:24:02] person
[1:24:03] [Music]
[1:24:05] what was he doing he was stripping the
[1:24:07] secret away
[1:24:11] hallelujah look what did his ministry do
[1:24:14] his ministry showed us how to get
[1:24:16] healing in our lives

[1:24:24] [Music]
[1:24:28] hallelujah if you take that away from us
[1:24:31] you put us back in darkness
[1:24:35] and i refuse to go back in darkness
[1:24:39] god has shown us the way
[1:24:42] and the things that were hidden for
[1:24:43] years
[1:24:45] god use a profit hug
[1:24:47] to strip the seals and open them up
[1:24:53] we got all the seals revealed
[1:24:55] that the white horse rider is no longer
[1:24:58] a mystery
[1:25:01] we know it's the antichrist
[1:25:03] he's been revealed holly and that gift
[1:25:05] was so precise he showed us harley the
[1:25:08] one that was riding the white horse was
[1:25:10] riding the red horse and the same one
[1:25:12] was riding the black horse and the
[1:25:14] sailor was riding the pear horse what
[1:25:16] was he he uncovered the whole mystery
[1:25:27] and you got these preachers come and try
[1:25:29] to make the seals mysterious
[1:25:31] no
[1:25:33] it's been revealed
[1:25:35] very simply
[1:25:39] [Music]
[1:25:42] they say oh the seventh seal ain't open
[1:25:44] i beg your pardon
[1:25:51] i beg your pardon
[1:25:55] because if it ain't open we have to be
[1:25:58] listening for another voice
[1:26:00] because he says in the days of the voice
[1:26:03] when he begin to sound the mission got
[1:26:05] to be finished
[1:26:08] so is the seventh seal open
[1:26:13] how do we know it's open
[1:26:15] okay let's make it plain
[1:26:20] the first four seals
[1:26:22] deal with the antichrist
[1:26:25] i'm not in there
[1:26:27] that has nothing to do with me
[1:26:29] that has nothing to do with you
[1:26:32] we not in there
[1:26:33] the fifth seal deals with the souls
[1:26:35] under the altar
[1:26:37] we're not in there
[1:26:40] hallelujah six seal deals with the jews
[1:26:43] i'm so not at you
[1:26:46] so where am i
[1:26:49] where are you then
[1:26:51] where are you church
[1:26:53] if you're not in a four if you're not in
[1:26:55] a five if you're not in the six where
[1:26:58] are you
[1:26:59] you must be in that seventh
[1:27:02] and if you're in that seventh that means
[1:27:04] you're no longer a mystery
[1:27:07] you've been revealed
[1:27:13] hallelujah
[1:27:16] because the prophet of god said the
[1:27:18] seventh seal deals with christ and his
[1:27:20] coming
[1:27:22] and his relationship with his pride
[1:27:25] and the opening of the word
[1:27:28] [Music]
[1:27:29] so where are you
[1:27:35] for those of you
[1:27:36] who still didn't catch it
[1:27:38] let's recap it
[1:27:41] let's recap it
[1:27:43] the first four seals deals with the
[1:27:46] antichrist
[1:27:48] hallelujah
[1:27:49] the pope paulie
[1:27:51] riding the devil holly
[1:27:53] riding changing masks
[1:27:55] we're not in there
[1:27:58] we're not in those first four horse
[1:28:00] riders
[1:28:01] fifth seal deals with the souls on the
[1:28:02] altar
[1:28:04] those that didn't get a chance to repent
[1:28:06] we're not in there
[1:28:08] six seal deals with the jews we're not
[1:28:11] jews
[1:28:15] so where am i
[1:28:17] where are you
[1:28:19] you must be in that coming of the lord
[1:28:23] and the seventh seal deals with the
[1:28:24] coming of the lord
[1:28:28] [Music]
[1:28:32] because remember malachi 4's ministry
[1:28:34] came to reveal two things earlier
[1:28:38] one here was restored the hearts of the
[1:28:40] children back to the faith of the
[1:28:42] fathers holy let the church be led by
[1:28:45] the holy ghost
[1:28:47] not a man we're not sitting on the
[1:28:49] moses's ministry we're sitting on the
[1:28:51] joshua
[1:28:53] [Music]
[1:28:55] the holy ghost is leading the church
[1:28:59] and he said the other thing his ministry
[1:29:01] came to do
[1:29:03] was to reveal those unknown seven
[1:29:05] thunders in the opening of the seals
[1:29:08] and we know that every time it thundered
[1:29:10] it was a voice of god
[1:29:13] [Music]
[1:29:17] and as he funded he uncovered a seal
[1:29:20] hallelujah he uncovered the first seal
[1:29:22] second seal first fourth seal holly
[1:29:25] fifth seal six seal and then he said hey
[1:29:28] i'm not gonna say anything about the
[1:29:30] seventh seal but we still caught it
[1:29:38] he didn't say anything about it on tape
[1:29:40] but we still caught it why because we
[1:29:43] are that seven sin
[1:29:45] [Applause]
[1:29:47] [Music]
[1:29:49] hallelujah
[1:29:51] we are the opening of the word
[1:29:55] [Applause]
[1:29:58] [Music]
[1:30:00] remember jesus said for those who it
[1:30:02] wasn't for they can't hear it
[1:30:05] they can't see it
[1:30:07] so how can we see it and hear it if he
[1:30:10] never said anything about it
[1:30:12] we must be the revealing of it
[1:30:17] we must be the revealing of that seven
[1:30:19] seed
[1:30:21] you are the opening of the word
[1:30:23] [Music]
[1:30:25] because remember when a word was spoken
[1:30:28] someone was already there to proclaim
[1:30:30] what's been said that's why john the
[1:30:32] baptist can say i'm the voice
[1:30:35] [Music]
[1:30:36] of one crying in the wilderness
[1:30:38] see he knew his place hallelujah
[1:30:41] hallelujah he knew his place when he
[1:30:43] wasn't even there when it was spoken
[1:30:49] i wasn't there when he preached the
[1:30:51] sales hallelujah
[1:30:56] but i was there
[1:31:02] that word came and found us
[1:31:05] and what did it say it said you are the
[1:31:08] manifestation
[1:31:10] of what the prophet preached
[1:31:13] see the thing is everybody knows who the
[1:31:16] groom is but nobody knows who the bride
[1:31:18] is
[1:31:20] [Music]
[1:31:25] see the bride she's specially elected by
[1:31:28] the groom
[1:31:30] it's all kind of women that's worthy but
[1:31:33] he has his own choice
[1:31:40] oh my i gotta come to a close
[1:31:48] [Music]
[1:31:57] and what god has used this voice to do
[1:32:00] to uncover every mystery
[1:32:02] so we're no longer living in darkness
[1:32:05] and listen he says
[1:32:07] any affair thing or person
[1:32:10] that
[1:32:10] proceeds feature that presents features
[1:32:14] or qualities
[1:32:15] so obscure
[1:32:17] as to arouse curiosity
[1:32:22] and that's what god has done
[1:32:25] has come
[1:32:27] holy and sent the word
[1:32:29] that the whole world couldn't receive
[1:32:32] but what did it do when you heard it it
[1:32:34] aroused your curiosity
[1:32:42] it made you say hey he said come and see
[1:32:45] her
[1:32:46] what the spirit is saying
[1:32:48] and you said i'm coming
[1:32:51] i'm coming
[1:32:53] but then you say like isaiah here i am
[1:32:56] lord use me
[1:33:00] remember the prophet god said he said
[1:33:02] calvary gave us the devil's answer
[1:33:05] [Music]
[1:33:07] you got the devil's answer
[1:33:11] [Music]
[1:33:13] oh my god
[1:33:14] he says any truth
[1:33:17] that is unknowable
[1:33:19] except by divine revelation
[1:33:23] that's what a mystery is
[1:33:25] any truth that's unknowable except by
[1:33:28] divine revelation
[1:33:30] now you give me another preacher that
[1:33:32] broke down the book of revelations
[1:33:35] besides malachi 4
[1:33:37] everybody else was running from it
[1:33:40] nobody else knew nothing about it
[1:33:42] remember before god got him he said the
[1:33:45] white horse rider was christ but then
[1:33:47] god came and checked them
[1:33:53] god said you ain't gonna mess this up
[1:33:55] [Music]
[1:34:03] listen oh my god
[1:34:06] listen
[1:34:07] let's tell the truth about god for a
[1:34:09] second let's tell the truth about god
[1:34:12] look the mysteries here is the mystery a
[1:34:15] mystery is scripture
[1:34:22] that's why everybody can live this
[1:34:26] because it has to be revealed
[1:34:29] [Music]
[1:34:32] you know the bible says great is the
[1:34:34] mystery of godliness
[1:34:37] that's why they look at you sisters and
[1:34:39] say i just can't see how you weigh them
[1:34:41] long dresses because it's not revealed
[1:34:43] to them
[1:34:46] great is the mystery of godliness
[1:34:51] i just can't see why you ain't got no
[1:34:53] tattoo everybody doing it great is the
[1:34:56] mystery of godliness
[1:35:07] he said the mystery of scripture is a
[1:35:09] previously hidden truth now divinely
[1:35:11] revealed
[1:35:13] but which is a supernatural element
[1:35:15] still remains despite the revelation
[1:35:20] so even though we have the revelation
[1:35:22] there still is a supernatural element
[1:35:24] that remains
[1:35:26] what is that element let's make it real
[1:35:28] simple
[1:35:29] faith
[1:35:34] faith is that supernatural element
[1:35:37] because without faith it is impossible
[1:35:40] to please the lord remember he says when
[1:35:42] i return will i find a mystery will i
[1:35:46] find a book will i find a tape no he
[1:35:48] said well i find faith
[1:35:51] when i return
[1:35:58] but before before we get out of here
[1:36:00] hallelujah
[1:36:01] look let's tell the truth about god
[1:36:05] let's look at how god really was
[1:36:07] thinking
[1:36:08] look
[1:36:09] this is the prophecy the first thing was
[1:36:12] that god wanted to reveal himself to his
[1:36:14] people
[1:36:21] he couldn't do it as a great jehovah god
[1:36:24] who covered all space time and eternity
[1:36:27] he could not he is too great to ever be
[1:36:30] revealed to people because it was too
[1:36:33] mysterious
[1:36:34] so what did god do
[1:36:37] god the prophet god said holy is that he
[1:36:39] said he was so high he couldn't go no
[1:36:42] higher so you know what he did he
[1:36:44] started to come down
[1:36:50] god said i'ma get on a level
[1:36:52] i'm gonna take away the mystery
[1:36:56] [Music]
[1:36:59] the prophet said he was just eternal he
[1:37:01] wasn't even god but as he started to
[1:37:04] come down brother simbo hallelujah he
[1:37:06] went from eternity to self-existing amen
[1:37:09] hallelujah that's him coming down
[1:37:12] from eternity to self-existing but you
[1:37:15] know when he became self-existing as
[1:37:17] elohim he still brought eternity with
[1:37:20] him
[1:37:26] wow
[1:37:28] boy my god is a bad boy
[1:37:32] [Applause]
[1:37:34] my god is a bad boy
[1:37:41] when he start condescending
[1:37:43] he didn't leave none of his self behind
[1:37:45] he brought everything that he was to the
[1:37:47] next stage
[1:37:48] [Applause]
[1:37:53] what was he doing he was bringing the
[1:37:55] mystery closer
[1:37:57] so he went from eternity to elohim now
[1:38:00] he's self-existing and then he stepped
[1:38:02] out of self-existence and became the
[1:38:04] logos
[1:38:06] did he start to create and he started to
[1:38:08] say let there be let there be what was
[1:38:11] creating eternity what was creating
[1:38:14] elohim
[1:38:17] all of us wrapped up in the logos
[1:38:20] all that god was he started to bring it
[1:38:22] down and he started let there be light
[1:38:25] and the scripture says that it was
[1:38:28] what was he doing he was uncovering the
[1:38:30] mystery of the earth because the earth
[1:38:32] was in darkness
[1:38:34] so god said let there be light
[1:38:37] and it was
[1:38:38] then he created the sun the moon stars
[1:38:41] animals and the last thing he created he
[1:38:44] created angels and the last thing he
[1:38:46] created he created a man
[1:38:55] [Applause]
[1:39:00] [Music]
[1:39:01] [Applause]
[1:39:03] [Music]
[1:39:06] oh
[1:39:12] [Music]
[1:39:18] i'll show you a mystery
[1:39:22] eternity
[1:39:24] came to elohim
[1:39:26] eternity elohim came to the logos
[1:39:29] the logos elohim eternity came to a man
[1:39:35] and he put all of that mystery in a man
[1:39:42] but before he got there
[1:39:44] he spoke into the mystery form to
[1:39:46] confuse everybody
[1:39:47] he says hey let us
[1:39:50] make man in our image
[1:39:53] let us make man in our image and i some
[1:39:55] people say well
[1:39:57] who was he talking to people talking to
[1:39:59] angels he was talking to that no
[1:40:01] he was talking to himself
[1:40:04] [Applause]
[1:40:05] [Music]
[1:40:06] because the only thing that could match
[1:40:08] up to who he was was eternity
[1:40:11] was the logos was elohim so he said let
[1:40:15] us
[1:40:16] make man in our image
[1:40:22] eternity was the only thing that could
[1:40:24] match up to his stature
[1:40:26] ello hill was the only thing that could
[1:40:28] match up to his statue creative power
[1:40:31] was the only thing that could match up
[1:40:33] to his stature
[1:40:36] you say come on brother these god
[1:40:38] talking to himself well let me ask you a
[1:40:40] question
[1:40:41] don't you talk to yourself
[1:40:46] don't you talk to yourself
[1:40:48] don't you talk to yourself don't you i
[1:40:50] don't know about you but sometimes i
[1:40:52] wake up and i might be feeling a little
[1:40:53] bad and i tell the devil oh no
[1:40:57] it ain't going down like that today
[1:41:00] god gave me power
[1:41:03] over unclean spirits
[1:41:05] i'm the head and not the town
[1:41:09] don't you talk to yourself
[1:41:12] [Applause]
[1:41:16] let us
[1:41:20] create man in our image
[1:41:22] and then god takes all eternity all
[1:41:24] self-existing power all created power
[1:41:27] and puts it in a man and you know what
[1:41:29] church god was so satisfied after he
[1:41:32] uncovered that mystery he never did
[1:41:34] anything else the bible said he rested
[1:41:41] [Music]
[1:41:44] brothers what are you saying
[1:41:46] there's no more revealing out of us
[1:41:50] after he got to us
[1:41:52] there's nothing else to be revealed
[1:41:55] [Applause]
[1:42:08] after he got to us the bible said god
[1:42:11] when he took a rest
[1:42:16] [Music]
[1:42:25] and just to show you that it's true
[1:42:28] just to show you that it's true
[1:42:31] as god condescended
[1:42:34] the rose now is in on us
[1:42:37] so we begin to us
[1:42:40] and we are seeing first with what
[1:42:42] creative power
[1:42:44] third pool ministry
[1:42:46] then we are seeing hallelujah with the
[1:42:48] logos
[1:42:49] then we are seeing harley back in heaven
[1:42:52] with god living for eternity
[1:43:00] the mystery has been revealed in you
[1:43:04] [Music]
[1:43:11] [Music]
[1:43:20] somebody say me
[1:43:22] somebody say me
[1:43:23] after god got to me
[1:43:26] he stopped
[1:43:30] after god got to meet somebody say me
[1:43:34] somebody say me
[1:43:35] after god got to me there was no more
[1:43:39] revealing
[1:43:48] that the god got to me
[1:43:50] there was no more unfolding
[1:43:54] after god got to me
[1:43:57] there was no more mystery
[1:44:01] [Applause]
[1:44:04] [Music]
[1:44:12] [Music]
[1:44:13] that's why the profit
[1:44:16] you be careful
[1:44:18] don't listen to these scoffers
[1:44:21] trying to take you away from this
[1:44:22] message
[1:44:23] if you let them take you away from this
[1:44:25] message they'll put you back in darkness
[1:44:28] because this message is the only thing
[1:44:29] that can tell you who you are
[1:44:37] because look let's make it real plain
[1:44:39] why the voice of the seven major
[1:44:42] because it's real plain and simple holly
[1:44:45] amen i was born after 65.
[1:44:48] so i wasn't here when the literal body
[1:44:51] of the prophet was here
[1:44:53] i wasn't here
[1:44:54] but you know when i was born
[1:44:56] billy graham was still here
[1:45:02] why didn't i connect with his message
[1:45:09] all rivals were still here
[1:45:12] why didn't i connect with his prosperity
[1:45:14] gospel
[1:45:17] because those messengers couldn't unlock
[1:45:20] who i was
[1:45:23] [Applause]
[1:45:25] it took the voice of the seventh angel
[1:45:28] and when he began to sound the mystery
[1:45:31] of god was finished
[1:45:35] [Applause]
[1:45:37] that's why we could come alive
[1:45:40] by just a voice
[1:45:43] but just a magnetic tape
[1:45:47] reading a book
[1:45:49] why because we're connected to a voice
[1:45:52] not a person
[1:45:57] [Music]
[1:46:00] [Applause]
[1:46:05] born after 1965
[1:46:08] but then one day
[1:46:09] i heard something say
[1:46:11] good evening friends
[1:46:16] i heard something say good evening
[1:46:18] friends and some started to say
[1:46:23] i started to come alive
[1:46:28] and the more i had it the stronger i got
[1:46:30] it
[1:46:35] then i began to realize who i was
[1:46:39] i know who i am
[1:46:48] church
[1:46:50] the mystery of god is finishing you
[1:46:55] before i close
[1:46:57] it's very important
[1:47:00] for us to be hearing
[1:47:02] unleavened bread
[1:47:04] [Music]
[1:47:09] because the word we're hearing
[1:47:11] is in seed form
[1:47:16] so i got c's in my hand
[1:47:22] oh we finna strip the devil boy we
[1:47:23] shouldn't give him a black eye
[1:47:26] we shouldn't give him a fat black guy
[1:47:30] look here
[1:47:31] what i have in my hand is seed form
[1:47:35] but you don't know what it is and see
[1:47:37] for
[1:47:39] it ain't no good and seed
[1:47:42] i can take these seeds
[1:47:44] put them on a pulpit
[1:47:46] and preach
[1:47:47] and preach and preach
[1:47:49] they'll never come to life
[1:47:55] they'll never come to life
[1:47:57] just sitting in church
[1:48:00] that seed needs something
[1:48:03] because satan sailor he tried to make
[1:48:05] you feel bad about all your mistakes and
[1:48:07] all this stuff
[1:48:08] sis hallelujah the only way these seeds
[1:48:11] can come forward hallelujah
[1:48:13] what's the element to bring forth this
[1:48:15] life
[1:48:16] dirt
[1:48:22] every seat needs dirt
[1:48:25] all your mistakes made you who you are
[1:48:29] all your shortcomings all your failures
[1:48:32] is a part of your revealing
[1:48:36] these elbows i made mistakes you needed
[1:48:39] that dirt to come forward
[1:48:42] [Music]
[1:48:46] without that dirt
[1:48:49] you'd never come out of your shell
[1:48:52] so god uses the dirt hallelujah to
[1:48:55] compact the seed hallelujah to come pack
[1:48:58] the shell and did it get so dry
[1:49:00] hallelujah to the real life's beginning
[1:49:03] to break out
[1:49:05] and dirt causes the activation of the
[1:49:08] mystery to come forward
[1:49:13] that's why we all got testimonies of
[1:49:16] where we came from
[1:49:34] has a promise in it
[1:49:40] [Music]
[1:49:42] every seed has a promise
[1:49:46] and if it's planted in the right ground
[1:49:48] that promise has to come forward
[1:49:51] and if you have to see the god in you
[1:49:54] you're full of promises
[1:50:02] you're full of promises
[1:50:04] and you know what there'll come a time
[1:50:05] in everybody's life holly
[1:50:07] what a mystery can no longer be
[1:50:09] contained
[1:50:11] the dirt can no longer hold it
[1:50:14] it starts to feel the presence of the
[1:50:16] sun and it starts to moving
[1:50:19] it starts to shaking
[1:50:21] it starts to rump in its head out and
[1:50:23] the next day you know ah
[1:50:26] i'm out of here
[1:50:29] i'm revealed
[1:50:32] i'm in his presence
[1:50:34] [Applause]
[1:50:36] see me for who i am
[1:50:39] i'm no longer a mystery
[1:50:42] [Music]
[1:50:44] what happened
[1:50:46] it feels the presence of the sun
[1:50:51] and the sun begins to pull that secret
[1:50:54] out of it
[1:50:58] until it pushes out fruit
[1:51:03] don't be satisfied with just sitting in
[1:51:05] a message church
[1:51:08] i want your fruit
[1:51:13] and until i can eat off your life you
[1:51:15] are indebted to me because i'm hungry
[1:51:21] i want what god gave you
[1:51:28] [Music]
[1:51:29] and look
[1:51:31] the power of having fruit
[1:51:34] is the reproduction of the seed
[1:51:38] because the seed is now in the fruit
[1:51:42] and then you plant the testimony all
[1:51:44] over again
[1:51:49] come on musicians i'm closing come on
[1:51:51] come on musician
[1:51:55] see god
[1:51:57] never wanted to be mysterious
[1:52:02] so be careful for these people who try
[1:52:03] to take you away from the message
[1:52:06] and say that there's something else
[1:52:08] there's this this that
[1:52:10] what else is there to be revealed
[1:52:14] he said when he began to sound the
[1:52:15] mystery of god
[1:52:17] it's finished
[1:52:20] holiday
[1:52:21] the greatest mystery is understanding
[1:52:23] calvary
[1:52:26] because calvary ties in with revelation
[1:52:28] 10 7.
[1:52:30] because they both are saying the same
[1:52:32] thing
[1:52:33] because when jesus gave up the ghost
[1:52:35] what was his last words it is finished
[1:52:40] so this message should bring you to
[1:52:43] calvary
[1:52:45] showing you that it's finished
[1:52:48] and there's nothing that the devil can
[1:52:50] do
[1:52:51] once god is revealed to you
[1:52:56] [Music]
[1:53:00] so let's not fear
[1:53:02] let them say what they want to say
[1:53:06] let them take down pictures let them do
[1:53:08] whatever look my salvation is not in a
[1:53:12] picture
[1:53:19] i'm wrapped up
[1:53:21] tied up
[1:53:23] in the blood and knowledge of christ
[1:53:27] and as long as i got jesus i'd be all
[1:53:29] right
[1:53:32] church
[1:53:34] from now on
[1:53:36] let this be your testimony
[1:53:39] it ain't about brother branner
[1:53:42] it's about me
[1:53:46] it's about you
[1:53:49] so when they try to show you brother
[1:53:51] graham did this brother ram did that he
[1:53:52] did it he said you say so
[1:53:57] what's that got to do with me
[1:54:01] i i'm gonna get real country right now
[1:54:04] i'm home i'm just i'm in carolina right
[1:54:06] i'm gonna get real country what that got
[1:54:09] to do with me i don't met the lord
[1:54:16] i
[1:54:17] don't met my god
[1:54:21] [Applause]
[1:54:22] [Music]
[1:54:23] [Applause]
[1:54:25] they need to go back and read their
[1:54:27] bible
[1:54:28] we rebecca met isaac she didn't even get
[1:54:31] ali's a thank you call
[1:54:33] [Music]
[1:54:34] [Applause]
[1:54:35] it was over
[1:54:37] you never heard anything else about
[1:54:39] elisa
[1:54:40] [Music]
[1:54:48] we thank god
[1:54:50] but too many people trying to get rid of
[1:54:52] eliza no he did his part we can't get
[1:54:55] rid of them you know why because eliezer
[1:54:58] was the only one who knew the way back
[1:55:00] to abraham's house
[1:55:04] [Music]
[1:55:06] so stay with this message
[1:55:08] if you stay with this message i
[1:55:10] guarantee you you will get back to god
[1:55:13] the father
[1:55:16] you will get back home

[1:55:24] let's give god some praise
[1:55:26] come on let's give him some praise
[1:55:29] [Music]
[1:55:30] let's give him some praise
[1:55:35] [Music]
[1:55:38] come on let's give him a prayer
[1:55:41] let's give god
[1:55:49] [Music]

[1:56:14] hallelujah
[1:56:15] [Music]
[1:56:22] my god
[1:56:23] what else do you want me
[1:56:25] what else should i tell you he was not
[1:56:29] here when we were preaching
[1:56:32] and he summarizes all back left and
[1:56:35] right and put it up together
[1:56:37] what else do you want me to tell you
[1:56:40] this is god
[1:56:42] this is god
[1:56:44] hallelujah
[1:56:46] i always say this message cannot be
[1:56:49] complicated
[1:56:51] we cannot leave the church and spinning
[1:56:53] around like we don't understand no the
[1:56:56] ministry was sent to make the message so
[1:56:59] plain
[1:57:01] because what branham said when god
[1:57:04] had the information
[1:57:06] he had the information with the purpose
[1:57:09] to make the promise so plain
[1:57:12] that the seed can receive it
[1:57:18] the mystery is revealed
[1:57:20] what else can i say
[1:57:22] amen the trial are you going through
[1:57:25] it's not a trial
[1:57:28] it's not an opportunity
[1:57:30] for him to unfold himself more and more
[1:57:33] and more and more and more and more and
[1:57:37] more and more
[1:57:39] look every time you go to a trial after
[1:57:42] the trial what happened to you
[1:57:44] you are even stronger than before
[1:57:48] amen
[1:57:49] he's going to bring you through a bear
[1:57:51] then he increase the power a little bit
[1:57:54] and bring a lion and then guess what
[1:57:56] there is another one that is coming up
[1:57:58] goliath and guess what
[1:58:00] then you can use the bear and the lion
[1:58:03] to defeat goliath
[1:58:08] anybody here
[1:58:11] so the trial you're going today is going
[1:58:14] to be a stepping stone a seed for you to
[1:58:17] use
[1:58:18] tomorrow to attack the next trial
[1:58:22] if the devil understood this thing
[1:58:24] the bible says heaven they know they
[1:58:27] would not have crucified
[1:58:29] the prince of peace if they knew all of
[1:58:32] this
[1:58:32] if they have seen this church
[1:58:34] they should have left jesus alive
[1:58:39] and back here because we are not in the
[1:58:41] first seal
[1:58:43] we are not in the second city we are not
[1:58:46] in the third seal we are not under the
[1:58:48] ministry of the antichrist
[1:58:50] we are not under the souls on the altar
[1:58:53] and the sick sill is even tribulation
[1:58:56] the bread can never go to tribulation
[1:59:02] remember boaz
[1:59:03] that's why he opened the first the
[1:59:05] second the sec the third the fourth the
[1:59:08] sixth measure of barley and he stopped
[1:59:12] like rebecca the seven
[1:59:14] it's me
[1:59:17] amen
[1:59:18] the seven it's me
[1:59:20] ruth the seven is me but that seven is
[1:59:23] not me alone
[1:59:25] i cannot share it myself
[1:59:28] i must have a bread
[1:59:31] [Music]
[1:59:34] amen
[1:59:35] do you know the woman at the well
[1:59:37] which husband jesus finally met
[1:59:42] which number why did jesus find him when
[1:59:45] he had the six
[1:59:46] not the first
[1:59:48] not the second
[1:59:49] not the third only when he reached six
[1:59:52] then jesus come he said you already have
[1:59:54] six
[1:59:55] now number seven belongs to me
[2:00:00] [Applause]
[2:00:02] amen number seven is the sabbath
[2:00:05] it's the resting that belongs to me
[2:00:09] and that seven turn that woman upside
[2:00:11] down and the whole city was on fire
[2:00:17] from a woman that was a prostitute to
[2:00:19] somebody who's speaking about the son of
[2:00:20] man ministry
[2:00:23] all the dirt that was collected
[2:00:27] all the husband
[2:00:29] that were collected
[2:00:30] was to manifest christ
[2:00:33] the pharisee didn't have that only that
[2:00:36] woman could manifest it he said sir i
[2:00:39] perceive that you are uh
[2:00:43] at the beginning he heard christ as a
[2:00:45] prophet
[2:00:49] did you hear that
[2:00:51] did you hear that the first time he
[2:00:53] heard the voice of christ
[2:00:55] he heard it as a prophet
[2:00:58] he recognized it as a prophet
[2:01:00] and jesus pulled him beyond the prophet
[2:01:03] he said it's okay i am a prophet but
[2:01:06] look behind the prophet i am the messiah
[2:01:12] so when this message pull you out you
[2:01:14] look behind the message you're gonna
[2:01:16] find the very person of jesus christ
[2:01:23] because he's number seven
[2:01:26] [Music]
[2:01:28] and we got all seven lines up
[2:01:30] seven seals seven churches seven
[2:01:33] messengers set every seven line that
[2:01:35] what else do go go in the world to see
[2:01:38] what number seven seven in lottery means
[2:01:42] i don't play lottery
[2:01:44] they know what it means
[2:01:46] anybody here but we have the original
[2:01:49] the seven finish everything when he
[2:01:52] created man then god
[2:01:55] because game is over
[2:01:58] because that man is responsible
[2:02:02] to do exactly what i was supposed to do
[2:02:05] in the earth
[2:02:07] i created the earth i'm too busy with
[2:02:09] the universe
[2:02:11] i was looking for somebody that looks

[2:02:32] knowledge of yourself
