tonight good to see everybody in the house of the Lord when I see everybody I mean those that are here and good to see you also online if you don't mind let's go to Exodus chapter 4 still continuing on the same series I hope my voice is good everybody hear me good praise God Exodus chapter 4 verse 1 as we promised last Sunday we went through the widow who I was it a widow we just describing everything that is in the Ministry of Elijah to make sure everybody can see why do we believe what we believe brother Branham has been so challenged people have attacked the message portraying things like whatever happened in the ministry of brother Branham is not based in the Bible that's why we are taking these to show you that dog in my we call into a different name but there is still a foundation in the Bible every god-given ministry have a foundation in the scripture but David would you have we can move up here please and Moses answered verse one and say thank you appreciate but behold they will not believe me you might be seated so last Sunday we saw that Moses was sent to pull Israel out of Egypt but before Moses goes there the Pharaoh must died we found out that Elijah was sent to take care of the widow but before Elijah was same the husband must be dead and our husband also our faith nature must die and our denomination where we came from must die before we be united to the Word of God but now as we promised we're going to be dealing with the two sons or the three the two pools we need to find them in the scripture why does brother Branham have those pools now when we look here we found out that Moses was given a commission to go rescue Israel we also we always talked how good or great Moses sees how great his ministry is but there was something that happened to Moses here Moses expressed something together he says they will not believe me in other words sending just a messenger or a man was not enough there was still a blockage rady you can send me anybody can claim God send them anybody can claim God spoke to them anybody can claim God have led them to do something but what is the vindication or the confirmation that this is the Lord so Moses was really conscious of that and he said yes I understand I don't have any problem I'll meet with you I'll see you we talk face-to-face I have an experience with you when I go tell Israel that you are the one who sent me the way I know them they're not gonna believe me because first of all when I tried to rescue them and came back again they rejected me so how am I going to go to a people under such a great difficulty slavery being mistreated by their taskmaster and tell them the Lord Jehovah send me they will not believe me especially when people are going through so much trouble it would be reach a point where they don't even believe there is any hope in the world even if you bring them the word of the Lord you say the Lord said this this this they say well let's see if it's going to happen or not so how are the people going to believe me I met you there's no problem but I'm worried about the people so first one and Moses answered and say but behold they will not believe me nor hearken to my voice for they will say the Lord has not appeared to you and the Lord said to him what is that in your hand and he say a rod and he say cast it on the ground and he cast it on the ground and he became a serpent and Moses fled from it we spoke about these in the constellation of the serpent that they may believe that the Lord of sorry verse four and the Lord said to Moses put forth your hand and take it by the tail we explained this before you see how everything is blending praise the Lord instead put a take it by the tail and he put forth his hand and caught it and it became a rod in his hand first five that they may believe that the Lord God of the fire of their fathers the God of Abraham the god of Isaac and the God of Jacob has appeared to you so the son of the road the miracle sana was given to Moses for a purpose the purpose was to make Israel believe that Moses was sent by God so the Fasano is a miracle working God the God of miracle and wonders send Moses with a son of miracle and Wonder and through this the people will believe if you want the people to believe the gospel you must couple the gospel with mark 16 they want to see a God in skin everybody clear verse 6 and the Lord say furthermore in other word in addition to this I am adding this why didn't the Lord stop in one son he wanted to add the second why he could have used the miracle and that's sufficient but God said let me add again this furthermore to him put now your hand in your bosom and he put his hand into his bosom we know that it's the right hand we already described that whatever Adam said it was the right hand most of men are right-handed remember the series and he put his hand into his bosom and when he took it out behold his hand was leprous as snow so the hand was beautiful when he went into the heart and when the hand pulled from the heart their hand revealed that which was hidden in the heart oh my god so there is a hand clean good looking good first when the hand goes into contact with the heart their hand came back with feeling that there is leprosy in the heart revealing a disease from the heart and when they hand went back again and came out there was no disease everybody clear so the heart of Moses had a secret is it clear now but the secret of their heart must be revealed that's the second son God gave to Moses the first son miracle wanders the second tab though the second son to reveal the hidden things of the heart are we clear clear praise the Lord and he said put your hand into your bosom again and he put his hand into his bosom again and plug it out of his bosom and behold he was turned again as he's out of flesh verse 7 verse 8 and it shall come to pass if they will not believe you the problem is to believe Moses but what does believe in Moses means the key is not just to believe Moses but to believe that Moses was sent from God the key is clear everybody there and it shall come to pass if they will not believe you neither hearken to your voice to the voice of the first son so this miracle here God called them as son everybody clear so when brother Branham comes with terminology if you don't know it relax that they will believe the voice of the ladder son so this is a son and the second one is a son so Moses had two sons and verse nine and it shall come to pass if they would not believe also these two sons everybody see there so Moses was given two sons so when you see somebody with two sons it is not unscriptural the son are given for a purpose to bring the people to believe the one God sent everybody clear neither hearken to your voice that you shall take off the water of the river and pour it upon the dry land and the water which you shall take out of the river shall become blood upon the dry land now you can take the water out of the river with a container you can go ahead a river you can pull your container pull the water out go to the dry land and pull it out and it's going to turn bland but the result so in that way you can move the water out of the river without human intervention you can move the water out of the river without your hand or your ability being involve into it you can move the water from the river out of the river you can displace the water from one place to another with a different channel and that channel was revered by Jesus Christ Jesus say if you want to speak to dismantle and if you want to displace the mountain from there without using that amount without using atomic bomb you can just speak to the mountain and the mountain will be moving from there and go into a different place so if they don't believe the Tucson I'm going to tell you another secret the other secret is the power of the spoken word so there is a first silent is miracle and wonders the second Sun is the revelation of the hidden part of the heart and the third sana is the power of the spoken word right here from your Bible everybody clear that you shall take the water of the river and pour it on the dry land and the water which you shall take out of the river shall become blood upon the dry land in other word they don't believe this there is this if they don't believe this there is another one right there that you can just pick the word and then the word will go ahead and take care of the things everybody clear now let's go to first Kings chapter 19 to combine this with what we have been dealing with the spirit of Elijah if you dare you can see a man okay few people it's Wednesday so we take it as a Sunday school everybody there first in chapter 19 verse thousand and as he lay and slept under a juniper tree this is Elijah he was tired running away from Jezebel went to a juniper tree and begin to relax behold then an angel touch him which angel is it we don't know yet an angel touched him and said to him arise and eat and he look and behold there was a cake baked on the cold so when Elijah was shaken by this angel the angel told him wake up and eat what he found was a cake and the second thing was water everybody there so the first touch of the angel the first food of the angel unveiled the cake and the water there was a cake big on the call it was fresh baked on a fire and a cruse of water at his hand and he did eat and drink and lay him down again so the first time he was fed by the angel he has an angel food first time Elijah this is before going to Mount Horeb everybody clear ok and verse 7 and the angel of the Lord so now we know who is that angel so that angel is the angel of the Lord so Elijah has two interaction with the angel of the Lord giving him food everybody clear and the angel of the Lord we started with Moses now we are with Elijah remember Moses Elijah Moses Elijah Moses Elijah you remember that now we are with Elijah and the angel of the Lord came again the second time so there is a second coming of the angel everybody there and touch him and say arise and eat because the journey is too great for you and he arose and did eat and drink and went in the strength of damid 40 days and foreigner to Horeb the Mount of God so we found out that the angel awake here woke him twice by feeding him and that angel was the angel of the Lord the angel of the Lord of the Lord so Elijah has to touch from the angel of the Lord and the third one he went to horrible and to him this is where he got an experience which we described similar to sunset mantle everybody there so before Elijah goes to horrible to experience what happen in our day in Sunset Mountain Elijah have a ministry with the angel of the Lord giving him to touch clear let's go to Luke chapter father and then we're going to pray if I just read this and don't build to dislike this somebody will be lost Luke chapter 5 verse 20 if you dare you can say Amen this is Jesus talking when they brought somebody who was sick Jesus say and when he saw their faith the Bible says actually when when he saw their faith he said to him men your sins are forgiven you the man was sick he came to be here but instead of Jesus dealing with him complete and just healing the man and let him go Jesus say ah first of all your sins are forgiven verse 21 and the scribe and the Pharisee begin began to reason saying who is this which speaks blasphemies who can forgive sin but God alone in other word deity can forgive sin so Jesus Christ was telling them right there that I am God verse 22 but when Jesus perceived their thought there is a perception of Tatia he answered he answering said to them what was on you in your heart Jesus begin to perceive what was happening in the heart and what was happening in the heart was not something good it was something bad he was not something pure he was something very bad everybody discernment in the heart whether is it easier to say your sins be forgiven you or to say rise up and work so right here Jesus is I'm falling unfolding the two components of the atonement Jesus is saying that healing somebody is just as much easier for me as forgiving their sin in other word I have the power both to heal somebody and to forgive their sin because the atonement have a dual component the atonement is I am the lord who forgive your sins and will also heal you from all your diseases so the atonement have the healing of the body and he also have the forgiveness of sins everybody clear so which weather is it easier to say your sins be forgiven you or to say rise up and walk but that you may know that the Son of man had power on earth to forgive sins he said to the sick of the palsy say to you arise and take up your catch and go in your house if you can go back to Exodus chapter 4 and then we're going to be praying praise the Lord so everybody got to pre the picture clear and let's take off from the airport Exodus chapter 4 everybody Dave all right let's pray Heavenly Father Lord we thank you for your grace your love your mercy and giving us another opportunity to be gathered together around the revealed Word of the our Lord your prophet and the Bible also spoke to us Lord that were the carcasses that's where the ego should be gathering law father your prophet also stated that Lord a true evil when the people arrive when the people are brought back to the word of the our Lord that's what we are holding Lord and we are committing this service unto the hand may the Holy Spirit may they he sad teacher Lord father may you come and teach a word to your children may you stabilize this church Lord may you heal those that are sick Lord may you answer to the need of the people according to their heart Lord father we claim everything under the blood of the Lamb rebuking every work of the devil and asking all in the name of Jesus Christ amen god bless you want some or once more we are continuing with our topic the unchanging pattern of God Malachi 4 now brother Branham say this I wanted to brought her to bring this back to your attention in their handwriting on the wall he says everything that is on earth today in the way of spiritual things such as the Spirit of God and the Spirit of the devil and all the codes and everything that we have today in the world they began in Genesis in other word there is nothing new Under the Sun Genesis means the beginning and all those things yet under another name and under another form this is very important when I explained to you that if you take John the Baptist you can spend your whole life trying to find the name of John the Baptist in the Old Testament you will never find it you're gonna lose it you're gonna miss God but when Jesus came he look at John the Baptist and he said this is Elijah who was supposed to come so Elijah was John the Baptist but in the time of John the Baptist he was never called a Raja he was called John the Baptist so you must understand that the Spirit does not change but they form that the spirit takes or the name that the spirit Vail into it might change so don't be caught up into the name and turn around and say I don't see that in the scripture because you can chase John you won't find it John even identifying himself by the scripture when they asked him who are you he said go to Isaiah 40 go to Malachi 3 so if you don't know the scripture you can miss God easily so what might be called in the Old Testament Elijah in the New Testament that might be called John the Baptist so what might be called in the Old Testament a son in our day is dama become a pool so when they say it's a first pool it's a second pool if you go into the Bible you searcher you will never find it that's why you need to look at the characteristic of what happened in the pool somebody's claiming here having a ministry with the first floor and the second pool before you judge before you criticize before you try to interpret before you try to figure it out make sure you look at the detail they lack of looking at details that's when we miss things over there when arrowed argick law the Pharisee he says come a little bit I'm hearing that the Messiah is born again born here were shoot the Messiah go they have to go into the detail and go back and forth and say ah it should be from Bethlehem why because the prophecies say Bethlehem little city of Judah so if you search a different way you're gonna miss it if you look at the name Jesus Christ in the Old Testament you won't find it you must identify the Messiah by the son when he discerned the woman at the well then the woman said wait a minute I discerned that you are a prophet and what you talking about is in the line of the Messiah and I know that when the Messiah comes he is going to be giving me explanation of the things you're talking about so the name will change the form will change but the unchanging God will never change in his characteristic that's why we need to look right there understand how God operated if you don't you're going to miss it Samuel grew into the temple he grew under the Ministry of Allah the prophet the Bible said he grew up he knew everything about the church but when God called someone somewhere run to Allah that's the problem in the message when God is speaking to somebody we are so caught up into a preacher we are so caught up into a personality and when God is calling Samuel the Bible says the Lord are called him but he goes back and Sarah you coming Eli say I didn't then he goes back the second time and they'll all call him again guess what who went back again to Allah that were your first Pharaoh must die that's why your first husband must die you must be shaken from your first husband from your first pastor you put too much confidence into him so God has to shake him away and the third time when he came same deal I said I perceive something I'm going to teach you something Eli never told Samuel that Samuel you need to follow me Allah gave Samuel the instruction to help Samuel develop his personal relationship with God that's why I am here brother Branham said the purpose of his ministry was not for people to follow him or to start an organization but to join the people into cluster and if that is the purpose of brother Branham I am now going to change from that purpose my purpose in this church is to give you instruction so that you can develop your personal relationship with God when allah when samuel went back to god he never came back over there again when god said hey señor he just gave the instruction and God begins to develop a personal relationship between him and Samuel until dealer came he say the Lord spoke to you something I hide anything from me I want you to start talking to me that's what I want in this church I want God to speak to the sister I want God to speak to the brother I want the nine gift of the Holy Spirit in the church so when we come here brother police telling me brother Steven the Lord spoke to me at four o'clock brother Maurice is telling me the Lord spoke to me at two o'clock brother Ramon is telling me the Lord spoke to me when I was at work since the Brazil is telling me when I was teaching the kid an inspiration struck me because we are in this together the pillar of fire was not for Moses only he wants for all Israel the pillar of fire was not for brother branham only it was for the entire broad the work that I do shall you do so we must get the sufficient instruction to develop a personal relationship with Jesus Christ the devil doesn't care how you worship Him whether you worship Him consciously or unconsciously or in a crazy way he doesn't care as long as you worship Him but God is very meticulous in the approach and the way you worship Him if you don't worship Him the correct way you're gonna miss God everybody clear so far so we want to know what is the characteristic but don't be caught up into the name don't be caught up into the form by the same spirit the beginning Jesus's will brings it out now when God was smoking was talking to Moses Moses gave God his trouble his problem Moses says that how is Israel going to believe me and God gave him three son to help Israel believe Moses then Moses came up again with another excuse he said I have a problem with my speech and when Moses brought that problem he opened up a door to a man that is called Aaron but God knew already who were on was in Exodus chapter 4 when I told you to open in verse 14 if you can read with me the Bible say and the anger of the Lord was kindled against Moses and he said he is not around there livid Aaron was a livid leave up in a scripture leads the minister and I leave that also in the scripture means the bride I will deal with that later on down the road where we're going to talk about the mystery of the stairs when they were carrying the Ark of the Covenant they were carrying that in the stave we need to find out what are those cave are we there then you will understand what is going on with deliverer he said that our Lord delivered your brother and know that he can speak well God already knew so in other word when God was sending Moses he coupled the Ministry of Moses with Aaron are you there so Moses was not the only one prophesied Aaron also was prophesying everybody following me and behold he comes forth to meet you and when he sees you he will be glad in his heart and you shall speak to him watch this carefully and put word in his mouth in other word God on the top is talking to Moses you need to understand this clearly we have God here giving instruction to Moses I did follow this clearly and you shall speak to him and put words in his mouth and I will be with your mouth and with his mouth so the anointing that puts the word on Moses was the same anointing that also put the word on Aaron so the word of losses originally was not Moses words he was the word of God and when he comes to Moses Moses delivered them to Aaron and Aaron are you have to do oath to repeat to repeat what Moses already said Moses cannot say a and Aaron said B if Moses say a Aaron was just a tape just a video just a repetition of Moses and Moses was a repetition of everybody so the god that anoint Moses was the god that anoint Ellen and if you notice Moses and Aaron were brothers Moses and Aaron were livid so leave that Moses was not different than leave at Aaron they were both of the same nature they were both of the same caliber they were above of the same family but one was just a little bit higher as the Prophet everybody clear and we'll teach you what you should do verse 16 and he shall be your Stockman so Aaron is the spokesman of Moses he shall be of spokeman to the people and he shall be even he shall be to you instead of a mouth and you shall be to him instead of God so when Moses presented himself Moses become God to the people everyone become a prophet to the people prophet under Moses this God was not to be worship but he was God as far as giving the message or destruction everybody clear now when Aaron prop up in Muharram if you notice down the road you found out that both of them met at the mountain of God then we found that there is something about Aaron that is a little bit tricky ruddy Aaron here is a Levite just like Moses Moses is the prophet of the hour and he have to give his message to Aaron which is a livid a type of the brother you say brother Stephen Aaron is a man how can a man be a brother a broad must be a woman if you go to the Book of Jonah you found out that in the book of Revelation John was a man and he represented the are we there if you go back you find that some son was a man and Sam son represented the church but one preached a message and deceived church by the world and he tapped Sam son as a church when Esau was meeting with Jacob brother Branham said Esau was a top of the Catholic Church brother Branham said the Benjamin was a top of the 144,000 and brother Branham also said that Jacob was a top of 124 and 44,000 so you need to understand how these things work so Aaron was a top of the brother and his ministry was to repeat what Moses spoke are you there but did you know that Aaron and Moses have the three years difference did you know that let's go to Exodus chapter 7 if you dare you can say Amen you there you can say a man please and the Lord said to Moses see I have made you a god to Pharaoh and Aaron your brother shall be a prophet God can't be sending are you there God coming down when God comes down the Prophet ministry also come down the prophet ministry was there when God came down on the Prophet level the prophetic anointing job into Aaron's level either okay you shall speak all that I commend you and Aaron your brother shall speak to Pharaoh that he sent the children of Israel out of his land verse 7 if you dare you can say Amen and Moses was four score years old which means every years old everybody know that so Moses was 80 years old everybody clear and Aaron's four score and three years which is what 83 years are you there so this church was born before the messenger when Aaron was born it took three years then Moses was born are you clear now odysseus started in 1906 and in 1909 three years brother branham was born are we clear we clear is it clear the bubble so we found three people there we found the angel of the Lord we found Moses who's the prophet and we find Aaron who is the top of the brother and if you go back to Revelation chapter 10 you will find that there is a Mahdi angel that comes down which is Christ and you'll find that if there is the seventh angel who is Moses a prophet are you there and you gotta find John who is also a top of the brother and the first time in Revelation 10 7 the Bible said at the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound so the first sermon have to be preached by the seven angel but in Revelation 8 the Bible said to John take the book and eat and you must also prophesy just like Aaron Professor Moses also prophesied John also prophesied everybody clear but what is the purpose of these pools let's go back to Exodus chapter 4 verse 30 if you dare you can say Amen verse 30 everybody there and Aaron spoke all the words which the Lord had spoken to Moses indeed the son in the sight of the people God gave Moses the son when they went and gathered the elder of Israel the did they perform the sun's first in order to gain the credibility or the trust of Israel are you there verse 31 and the people believed everybody here the people believed after those side were performed so when they got to the elder they took the road put it on the ground turn up to a serpent put it back up Moses took his hand put it on ISA pull it back up and say the Lord God met me when he says that clear no problem and when God the angel of the Lord met Moses in the pillar of fire he was secret but to be brought to the public Moses needed to son to be expressive in order to break the people believed him when the angel of the Lord met brother branham he was private but brother branham must have two son in his ministry in order to make people to believe him we are dealing with the first and the second pole those three are line up the Prophet the bride and the spirit ought we must say the same thing either what a random say here that those who receive the prophet in his own name will receive the beneficent effect of the prophet's ministry and they die he him will be blessed and become part of the broad of the last day there were many people that are hearing the Prophet but that are not part of the brother that's why the Bible keeps saying to him they have a here that's a spiritual ear the spiritual ear is a resolution which gives the new birth we have so many people in the message forty years two years five years they don't even know how to deal with this ministry are you there who mentioned in revelation 22:17 their spirit and a broad God an errand both of them are saying come God Christ and John both of them are saying come the god of Moses was the god of Aaron the god of brother branham is the god of the brother are we there now he said here yes listen to their authenticated prophet of God who appear in this Lesage what he says from God there Brad will say that's why when we bring the coat when you live in brother Branham you must be able to humble your wheel toward the Prophet chain it is amazing how we can bring somebody the word and still they are resisting the word because they want to go their own way they only accept the coat when they caught much their agenda but we are not here for our agenda we are here for the word of God when they bring you the world whether it pleases you or not we need to bow down before the Word of God are we there we want to be trained away what he says from God the bride will say they spirit and the Prophet and the bride will be saying the same thing that's why the instruction from God get to Moses and the instruction when you get to Moses he doesn't change he get the same instruction to Aaron and wider God the prophet and the brand they are all lined up God Christ the seven angel brother branham and abroad always say the same thing if we don't say the same thing you are out of the line and the voice of the prophets will say get back to line the spirit and the prophet and the blood will be saying the same thing and what they will say we'll have already been in the so it's not something new if you have not found it to eat the bubble yet maybe the Holy Spirit have not quickened that to you yet it is hidden somewhere in a way to personally until God send a ministry that will enlighten you now when we look at these Tucson the miracle science of the rod and the Sun in the hand that went in and pull em proceeded we are dealing with the two signs or the two pole I told you don't be caught up into the terminology by you look at the characteristic everybody clear now why these two sons God is sending Moses to Israel but Elmo Moses say I have a problem these people won't believe me God say I'm going to give you two son why why did Moses say people won't believe me what about them say God does not fall upon denominations God does not fall upon mechanical devices God the Holy Spirit fell upon men man is God's agent and the hardest thinks that God has ever had to do was to get one mortal to believe another that's what Moses said they won't believe me we grew up together we were brothers and sister and you turn around and you say you're a prophet get out of here I know we were born before you and Joseph here you are growing up and you come up with dreams with spiritual thing where I hear you matter of fact you were born out of wedlock we know your story that Mary got pregnant before he was even married and you come you telling us that you are the Messiah get out here until Jesus a prophet in his one country is not well honored why it is difficult for a man to believe another man you might be at work with your coworker your body you're on the same job doing the same thing probably getting paid the same salary but the day they will bring you or take you to the office and say from here on you are the supervisor that's what you know what happen it would be hard for your friend to take you as a supervisor are you there it would take your time until he catch up and understanding that's why man it is the hardest things God have to do is to get one more toe to believe one motor Moses was there their new Moses they understood Moses they knew even the weakness of Moses that Moses killed somebody and hide him were there how can you take someone like that and bring him back to Israel and say Israel the Lord spoke to me Moses said with my background with everything I deal with everything they know about me with everything they know about my ministry there is no way I can qualify to talk to these people why because it's difficult for one man to believe another do you believe that amen they could not believe Moses and God give him two sons we are dealing with two sons as we promised to prove to the people that he was sent from God for their deliverance it's Babel it's the profit line up correctly you believe that well even he the same yesterday today and forever the unchanging part of God brother Branham is telling you if in the Old Testament he did that by giving two sons to somebody to bring a girl to believe him don't you think he's still doing the same thing today he did it in the Ministry of Jesus Christ he Jesus the first pool and the second pool and the third pool do you think he can do it again today but based on the unchanging pattern of God God does not change don't be caught up in the name don't be caught up in the form but look at the characteristic of the ministry but a Branham continued he said do you believe now he went back to the angel the angel that talked to him in a burning bush he's the angel of the Covenant and what about him said that angel is Christ we know that I have plenty of coats work was that right all right he's the same yesterday today and forever in other word God does not change he is here now in other word will happen in law system is here are you there okay and he does the same thing today that he did them he still perform wonders and son did you see that wonders and son he is a miraculous God and he's always worked in miraculous way with sons and wondered and he promised them in this last day and we are living in the last day we got a right to expect them now to bring his people together the Jewish were trained to wait on the messiah the samaritan were trained to wait on us am I on the on a messiah until even a prostitute no she have to wait on a messiah but the Gentile were not trained to wait on the messiah now we got to be trained by brother branham that there is a promise for you that god the unchanging God will be expressing himself to the Gentile in the last day but when he comes to the gentle in the last day it is your to expect him to do the same thing he did in the Old Testament because Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever God does not change everybody clear as we continue to build up what about him say he says do not feel when that voice spoke I knew it I knew he was the same one he looked at me his eyes look upon me kindly not to look sympathizing with this angel say do not feel say I am sent from the presence of God to tell you that to were born a peculiar birth and your packet and and your peculiar life has been to indicate that you are take that you are to take the gift of divine healing so brother Branham was born with a gift of divine healing but we are dealing with the two sons either to the people of the world I say sir I am uneducated hakuna go he said if you shall get them to believe you the problem is to believe are you there so when they tell you you guys are talking about third pool first pool where is that in the Bible I am bringing that down are you there to believe you and if you are sincere when you pray nothing shall stand before your prayer if you get them to believe you and I say I bet they would not believe me sir history repeat itself are you deaf he said you shall be given true science as the prophet Moses was given to son to get the people to believe you is that really the issue so the problem was his head is the problem rather Branham was concern about it because it's hard for one mortal to believe in a D'Amato especially when the ministries great are we there he said one of them was detecting disease just by holding the person like him in your left Moses hand was the right one brother branham was left okay the near future business here he shall come to pass that you shall tell the very secret of the heart we were going slowly until the picture comes up and the things that they were doing wrong to do what what is the purpose of the Sun to build the faith in the people to be in faith and to vindicate you that I God will send it to you it's to van de Kate you that what Moses is saying is coming from God are we clear all right minister explain what a Branham say me go right here how could I go to face the people of the world to take that gift he said I will be with you I said they will not believe me that's the problem he said you'll be given two sons now remember sons does not here the purpose is to bring the people to believe you sons Basner hill the Sun rose faith to hear but only through faith is he here do you understand son only work faith trust credibility the angel of the Lord and he performed those sons one time and that is what war and that Devils all he did it Israel believe from then on believe Moses and follow the leader why this son is not for you to follow me my purpose not for you to follow me not to follow me but to follow what I tell you that's why we must be obedient to the message of the hour we must follow the instruction of God from our losses brother Branham was heat cross the Sun and the Sun are vindicated whatever he speak follow and the Sun is that that you are to follow the Lord Moses go to Egypt bring the people unto myself we saw that you see bring them to God the Lord Jesus Christ the Holy Spirit will lead you so we understand the purpose of these sons the reason that you hear me say sometimes get the people get the people say believe me see now the reason I say that is not to believe me as him is not to believe that Moses easy or God are you there now certainly not certainly is to believe that I have told you the truth that he has sent me to do this to believe that your messenger was sent from God to bring you out of something now see when that angel met me he said if you get the people to believe you believe you as what as God's servant anointed for that age and if you believe that you must follow what destruction everybody clear now when we look at these two sons we find there is a son of miracle and wonders and we found that there is a second Sun here which is the Sun of diseases but we spoke that in the atonement it's a dual Suns either the atonement deal with the forgiveness of sin and he also deal with the healing of the body and we found out that the two science of losses was bundled up under the atonement let's go slowly sickness is an attribute of sinner before we had anything we had no sickness sin came and sickness followed him as an attribute of see any sickness may not you've seen it either or a direct or indirect direct you did it yourself indirect may be a great great great father did something and that curse keep coming down either he may he may you inherited somewhere the weakness of your people who sing it's dropping down as he said each generation getting weaker and wiser but it's either direct or indirect calls from sin so somebody seen someone for instance like this if a big serpent was here or Ebay or a great big something that had me by the side with his power I explained this before and was hurting me with his part now it's not necessary for me to have to cut the animal pie off because he's still alive but if something hits him in the head and kills him that kills him all over and when Jesus atone for sin he kills him and every one of its attribute he killed the serpent from its head so that serpent that Moses was permitted to touch by detail by the attribute because the law was dealing with the attribute I explained this before was already speaking about the atonement coming he said Moses you are not the one to bring Redemption they will be war who's gonna bring Redemption that one will be the one crushing the head of the serpent because in the Garden of Eden a promise was given that your seed will Bruce is here but he will crush your head everybody clear so the atonement had already the first son of Moses into it everybody clear let's continue why are you going with the atonement now because Jesus say which one is easier sin forgiven living holding the right hand over his heart standing like this talking about Moses we spoke about the serpent now we're talking about the second son here the hand where the hidden secret of redemption had been healed since the foundation of the world watch him pulled from his body from his bosom bosom his right hand smitten with deadly proceed show what God will do with his right hand I'm on a job here leprosy symbolizes sin and incurable and especially in its last stage we're going we're talking about the atonement that the secret same sermon had been in God's bosom all these years covered by the right hand who Jesus so the first time brother Branham incorporated those two sons he's incorporating those son under the atonement in other word those son are included in the atonement right so when Moses is going God does not give him two sons by any chance God knew that the atonement has to go for his children and he gave the top of the atonement by the Serpent and also by the hand showing that Christ will crush him and not only will he will cross it he will also bring the atonement to clean the heart of a man are you there whatever Adam say as there are 53 he was wounded for our transgressions bruised for our iniquity chastisement of our peace was upon him with his trap we are here healing and forgiveness of sin the secret of God's healing lead in the bosom of Jesus are you there everybody or God he was the right hand of God that is the only shift I have in the bosom the secret so those two sons that God gave Moses which we call today the first and the second pool are science that component of the atonement when the atonement comes to ask you somebody from somewhere God put those two sons because God is perfected in three there are three Exodus the first one Moses did it God loaded that atonement the second time Jesus came which is the second Exodus God loaded o son but the earth another third Exodus for the gentle so God have to learn those to Sol because Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever God does not change everybody clear now let's get to those sign themselves the facade he said throw it on the ground brother branham and he threw it down and when he did it turned to a serpent he picked it up by the tail now it's no more the atonement the Sun itself he turned back to a road again and God showed Moses that what could what he could do that he was still the Living God he could tap the natural and change it into supernatural he could do whatever he wanted to because he was God the God worked in miracle and wonders let's go now to the son amen thank your hand put it in your bosom he did over his heart pull it up he was white with leprosy white see it means the conscious of length the heart of men is white with leprosy the very thought of his mind is leprosy sin so the first son in brother branham ministry will be a sign of healing that's why brother Branham is born with a gift of healing and when brother Branham starting with his first pool it is more miracle and wonders are you there but on the second son of God a Branham it's going to be a son of discernment to discern the heart of the people and pull the secret of the healing out you come for healing the prank there is no son no no no healing they pray there is no healing you need the second pool and when the second pool plug in he's going to look and say hey the reason why you don't get heal are you there the hand is put in your heart and when they pull their hand out they said the reason why you don't get here in 1900 and so you committed adultery and you never repented to your wife go ahead and repent and that was it and when somebody repented they put the hand back off come up clean then brother Branham say God there is no devil in hell that can withstand your healing why God wanted to heal his people he healed by the first son he knew by the first pool or he healed by the second son that helped dig into the people hurt to pull the sin atoned for the same then Israel but those two sons had to bring you to believe the messenger everybody here as we continue now when we talk about healing with Elijah we thought that Elijah was fed by the crow and he was fed with bread and flesh we explained to you what bread was by the scripture he was the healing now when we talk about healing itself we know that bread and flesh have to be combined because the first in first Thessalonians chapter 1 verse file the Bible say that the gospel should not be preached by word only but by power and what demonstration you must have bread and flesh everybody clear now when we talk about healing how does healing express itself Healing expressed in two ways I'm going slowly the first is what we call miracle I'm digging this so we understand clearly miracle means a person work here on the wheelchair you pray for that person right now the person rise up and begin to walk or a person have crutches they pray for that person right now and the person through the crutches away and go miracle doesn't take time everybody here but there is a second part of healing there work he worked by the casting of of devils you first cast out the devil but the person is still looking sick I then then after a while the healing catch up with that person and the person get healed that is called divine healing that's the reason why when Jesus was passing through the fig tree he spoke the word and when Jesus spoke the word the word struck the tree but the tree was still there looking right it took the next day for Peter to say hey wait a minute yesterday you spoke but today the tree is withered that is the son of divine healing the demon goes first but the symptoms are still there and you need to hold on to faith because the body need to cleanse itself and we move the symptom so they can pray for you here they keistered ever nothing happened after two months you get pregnant everybody here now in Matthew 7 verse 22 23 you can look at this at home Jesus say that he shall come on to me you remember that we said Lord Lord have we not family yet Lord Lord have we not what cast out Devils do more miracle in your name are you there they say that but they never spoke about preaching Gordon remember they never said it up they said have we not prophesied on him have we not cast out their fall in your name have we not do many miracle in your name are you there let's look at that and I'm gonna stop here notice the very day when this messenger not when he start on but when he begins to declare his message see the first pool is what healing second pool of a sign then put the opening of the the ministry revealed the opening of the world no more there is no more higher order to reveal the word than profit but the only way the profit can be vindicated is by the world remember the third pool was the opening of them seven sealed to reveal the hidden truth that has been read in the world first pool is worth healing second pool is worth professed sighing so right here when Jesus was talking about the workers of iniquity Jesus was telling you that the first and the second pool can be impersonated we clear have we not cast a devil have we not do miracle in your name have we not prophesy in your name that's why the first and the second pools impersonated are you there but the third pool is the opening of the word but if you look at the third pool what is the turn pool I'm gonna stop here the second please perfection the second pool was discernment of the spirit they deserve they found out your sin pull it out and clean it their prophecy France was the healing of the sick the second was prophecy that went forth and he know the secret of the thought when the word itself was made manifest which that's grace the seven is the finish could this be the finished pool what about I'm called that the finished pool now I'm going to drop here and I'm now going to get there because it's too deep now but let me go straight to the third pool there is no more ministry there is more to the ministry than divine healing the sick as body our know of tonight is the so-called body of Jesus Christ in each burrito hearing and the OSI and there is only one bomb that I know that will hear and that is the word so the first is the healing by miracle or by casting our devil which is the first pool the second pool is the prophesy God discern discernment of the heart and provide you a healing but they turn pool is the healing by the world that's why from chapter 107 verse 20 the Bible say ascend my word and my word heal them you can get healing under the first pool under the second pool or under the third pool are you there both of them are bundle up until under the atonement they therefore can impersonate these two but never this down the road are we going to continue to see how does those pool interact and we're going to see those pool in the life of Elijah are we there let's pray because our time is over Heavenly Father Lord we thank you again for your grace for your love and for your mercy father thank you for bringing this stuff clear unto us Lord it took an hour of such a shaky load to bring this revelation out Lord it is overwhelming to me it is overwhelming to your show the Lord but is your grace opening their eyes so we can see clearly and where we were been struggling or where we have doubt or where we wonder or where doubt was they inserted somewhere these doubt can clear that the fog can be taken away completely and we can see you face to face not again through a glass but we can see you face to face because we want to kiss our husband they reveal word of the our Father we thank you again for this service tonight we ask you lord father that's the Holy Spirit continued to minister to your children Lord and as the week go by father may you consecrate our heart may you keep us close again more closer unto the Lord to prepare ourselves for the Sunday service Lord if you tarry to come Lord prepare our heart every day so that whenever you can come father we can be ready to meet you in the air father we thank you for everything committing ourself and to the hand in the name of Jesus Christ amen god bless you church we love you brought a bow and forgive me I try not to make a habit of getting up and talking after the pretty sure I like to just sing a song dismiss I know we got to get out of here and then everybody's probably ready to go home no one's here to hear me I know that but God put this on my heart so I have to say it I just watch how God has led me over the years it's just a testimony of what God's done for me I first came up here to to visit my my wife and we recording and and I moved up this way to get to know her better because I want to like marry her without really getting to know her so I moved up this way and I watched God how he positioned me in Tim's and at the times Tim was still using the quotes and Tim brought out an understanding of the Holy Ghost better than I've ever seen in my entire life through my whole life of being born and raised in the message for the Tim printed out everywhere where brother Branham talked about the Holy Ghost and everywhere the scripture talked about the Holy Spirit and he tied it in and it gave me a revelation of the Holy Ghost like I've never seen before and that was a blessing to me in that time something drew me back to Florida and I went back to Florida and then the pastor down there that I was attending he did a study on the church age book and I got a greater understanding of the church ages and I've ever got before and I watched God I we placed me at Tim's for a season then placed me back in Florida for a season two and all my life as a teenager I prayed for a greater revelation of his word I heard brother Branham said pretty for a greater revelation of his word and I watched God how he positioned me here positioning me there and gave me a greater revelation of his word and they can't brought me back here and there was something wrong but out of that came came this and I watched brother Steven and I'm gonna give him a rose and not so he can get a big head or anything but I want to I know it's God working through him and I've heard so many of these things all my life being born and raised in the message so many of these things or where pastors will tie you know the message in with the scripture but never to the extent of brother Steven and I don't believe it's cuz like he's a he's our eighth messenger we know we don't have an eighth messenger I'm just saying I know he's not like more special than anybody else but what it is is I see that he has devoted so much time into studying this word in this and in this message like I've never seen before I'm so thankful for that I told my wife I said he didn't get this overnight he didn't get this in a week or a month this is a lifetime or however long he's been in this message of studying and digging in and time spent and I wanted to know that I appreciate it because now I believe God's placed me here first season I don't know if it's forever I don't know how long it's in his it's in his time but while I'm here the things I'm learning even just right here I've watched this this Moses and Aaron tied into the into the message but never to the extent of brother Steven dead tonight even with the three years and how the lay at the CNH started three years before brother Branham came on the scene just all these things so perfect and I believe it's just I believe it's just brother Steven completely giving himself over and studying and I'm Graham thankful for it I really am I could I would love to say and I'm almost done I'm almost done I just had to testify it was on my heart I'm sorry but I have to say I feel like I could listen to it for hours and at times I'm I get overwhelmed I can't keep up almost I know he goes slow but I'm just like oh it's so much it's so much I almost wish I could have like a 30 minute lesson every day you know every evening I have a 30 minute lesson but I'm so grateful for it I'm so grateful for being here for each one of you and for a pastor that really and just one last thing and I'll be done one last thing but how God talked to Moses and told Moses Moses said I'm not a good speaker so Moses God gave Moses Aaron you know as brother Stephen related it back to the message I'm doing the same thing and allowed Aaron to be Moses mouthpiece but Aaron said what Moses said and all my life going through the message and hearing preachers I watched so many times I'll they'll say what Moses said but they'll say what they think and what they have to say too and one thing I see about brother Stephen is he doesn't just say what he thinks but every single thing he says is what Moses said and it's what God said and that's what I look for as a pastor because I don't want to hear a man's opinion I want to hear what the message says because that was what was given to us in our time because what it says is what God has said the way he tied it into and like I said I'm giving him roses one one after another but I know it's because he has completely surrendered himself and I'm so grateful for it I'm thankful for I don't take it for I don't take it for granted not not from brother Steven and not from God because he placed them here but anyway I apologize y'all forgive me I tried to be brief will sing will sing a song real fast and will dismiss but uh God put this on this song on my heart as well so um I trust y'all know it spear to God move wretch your word in my heart feel my whole being consumed my life Spirit of God move an empty vessel I wanna be so that you can come Lord and fill me one more time say Spirit of God move right your word in my heart fill my whole being consumed my life Spirit of God move an empty vessel I wanna be so that you can come for Dan me god bless you [Music]
