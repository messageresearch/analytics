[0:01] and his love is to you to give you that
[0:04] what you ask for. Do you believe that?
[0:07] Then Lord God
[0:09] omnipotent, we pray that you will
[0:12] manifest your blessings to this woman
[0:15] and give to her and reward her according
[0:18] to her faith through Christ's name. We
[0:21] ask this. Amen. The Lord bless you, my
[0:24] sister. And as you have believed, so
[0:27] will it be unto you. God be with
[0:32] you. Now, how do you do, sir? I suppose
[0:36] that you and I are total strangers to
[0:39] each
[0:42] other. I never met you in my life as I
[0:46] know
[0:47] of. But you are
[0:50] aware that something's going
[0:52] on. And that is the feeling that you
[0:55] have now. You don't get that by standing
[0:58] by a
[0:59] man. It's his presence that the audience
[1:02] might know. Would you raise your hand if
[1:05] there's a sweet humble feeling around
[1:08] you? You feel the spirit of the Lord.
[1:11] Raise up your
[1:18] hand. There's something connected with
[1:21] this man about waters or across the
[1:25] sea. Now I see a woman also near him.
[1:30] It's in
[1:31] vision. And it is a woman here. She sits
[1:34] right here with a little red hat
[1:39] on. And I see
[1:43] waters and she's praying about
[1:48] someone. It's a
[1:50] relative. It's a man. It's her brother.
[1:56] And the man is sick unto death if God
[2:01] doesn't heal him because he's got a
[2:03] tumor in his
[2:07] breast. And he doesn't live here. He
[2:10] lives across the seas in Norway. It's a
[2:12] great hilly naughty country. That's thus
[2:16] sayeth the Lord.
[2:23] Have faith in
[2:25] God and say to this mountain, "Be ye
[2:29] raised up and thrown into the sea."
[2:32] Don't
[2:33] doubt. But if you don't believe right
[2:36] now, something will turn
[2:44] loose. This man's connected with some
[2:47] sort of overseas water.

[4:25] Once my
[4:27] soul was
[4:29] [Music]
[4:31] array from the heavenly
[4:38] way and was wretched
[4:43] and
[4:44] vi could be.
[4:52] But my
[4:55] savior
[4:58] above gave me
[5:01] peace, joy and
[5:05] love when he
[5:08] reached down his
[5:12] hand for me.
[5:16] [Music]
[5:19] When he
[5:21] reached down his
[5:25] hand for
[5:31] me when he
[5:35] reached down his
[5:38] hand for me.
[5:44] [Music]
[5:46] I was
[5:48] lost and
[5:51] unknown without
[5:55] God or his
[5:58] son when he
[6:01] reached down his
[6:05] hands for you. Let's sing a little bit
[6:08] more of this this morning. Amen.
[6:12] I was
[6:15] fearing
[6:18] despair when he came
[6:22] to be there.
[6:25] And he showed
[6:28] me that I
[6:32] could be free.
[6:39] And he
[6:42] lifted my
[6:44] feet, gave me
[6:48] glory
[6:51] complete when he
[6:54] reached down his
[6:57] hand. For let's sing the next verse. How
[7:01] my heart does rejoice. Amen.
[7:05] How my
[7:07] heart does
[7:10] rejoice since I made
[7:14] him my
[7:17] choice. From the
[7:21] tempest to him. Now I
[7:30] flee. Now I bleed.
[7:34] On his
[7:37] arms, I'm
[7:40] secure from a
[7:43] heart since he
[7:46] reached down his
[7:50] hand for me when he reached. Amen.
[7:57] When he
[7:59] reach down his
[8:02] hand for
[8:09] me when he
[8:12] reached way
[8:15] down for me.
[8:20] [Music]
[8:23] I was
[8:25] lost and
[8:28] undone without
[8:32] God or his
[8:35] son. When he
[8:38] reach down his
[8:41] hand for me, let's sing the last. Amen.
[8:48] Now since the
[8:50] [Music]
[8:51] Lord gave me
[8:54] peace of heavenly
[8:58] joy never
[9:01] cease. Lord I
[9:04] give all my
[9:07] life to thee.
[9:12] [Music]
[9:15] Guide my
[9:17] feet, hold my
[9:20] hand. Grant with
[9:24] thee I may
[9:27] stand. For you
[9:30] reach down your
[9:33] hand for me.
[9:37] [Music]
[9:41] When he
[9:43] reached down his
[9:46] hand for
[9:49] [Music]
[9:53] me when he
[9:56] reach out his
[9:59] hand for me.
[10:02] [Music]
[10:06] I was
[10:12] lost without
[10:15] God or his son.
[10:19] And he
[10:21] reached down his
[10:24] hand for me.
[10:28] [Music]
[10:32] Oh, when he
[10:34] reached down his
[10:38] hand for me.

[10:46] When he
[10:48] reached down his
[10:52] hand for me.

[11:06] undone without
[11:09] God or his
[11:12] son. when he
[11:16] reached down his
[11:20] hand for you,

[11:29] God. Thank you, Father. Thank you,
[11:33] Lord. Lord, thank you for reaching down
[11:36] your hand for everyone here, Lord. each
[11:38] person. Lord, we might not have been in
[11:41] the same trouble, Lord, but your mercy
[11:44] was
[11:45] great and your grace was
[11:48] great and you showed us mercy, Lord.
[11:53] And you showed us that grace, Lord.
[11:57] And you saved us, Lord.
[12:00] [Music]
[12:01] Your death on the cross, Lord, was a
[12:04] mighty thing,
[12:06] Lord, and you saved
[12:09] us. We can't begin to express our
[12:13] gratitude,
[12:15] Lord. It doesn't matter, Lord, whether
[12:18] it's 11th hour, Lord, or in the morning,

[12:34] Lord. We want to praise your name, Lord.
[12:37] We want to let you know how grateful we
[12:39] are, Lord
[12:40] God. But we're also here for more, Lord
[12:44] God. More and more and more,
[12:47] Lord. As brother Zach sings, Lord, I was
[12:50] made for
[12:53] more. And we are here for our portion.
[12:56] Lord, give us this day, Father, our
[13:01] Father, our daily bread,
[13:04] Lord. And Lord, also forgive us of our
[13:07] trespasses, Lord, as we forgive, Lord,
[13:11] those who might trespass against
[13:13] us. Have mercy today, Lord God. Bless
[13:17] your people this morning, Lord. Bless
[13:20] that precious word that's about to come
[13:22] forth, Lord. And as we till the ground,

[13:27] seed falls. Lord, we have no doubt about
[13:30] that. Lord, this is a precious people

[13:43] pastor.

[13:53] When one hurts,
[13:56] Lord, we all
[13:59] hurt. So we thank you,
[14:02] Father. We thank you for the unity and
[14:05] the love that you've given this
[14:09] congregation. No malice, no
[14:12] strife, no
[14:14] backbiting, no jealousy or envy.
[14:20] Just godly love, pure agape love.

[48:49] the house of the Lord. Amen. Amen. Amen.
[48:54] Glory to God. Forget about all your
[48:57] trouble. Brother Tine already dealt with
[48:59] it.
[49:00] Amen. Amen. Amen. Never come to the
[49:04] house of the Lord with a low energy.
[49:10] Don't worry, I will get into that.
[49:14] I will get into that. Amen. We greet you
[49:17] all in the precious name of our Lord and
[49:19] Savior Jesus Christ, both visible and
[49:22] invisible audience. Amen. Amen. Any
[49:25] family members here, any new subscriber
[49:28] online, welcome to Spoken Word
[49:31] Tabernacle. Amen. Where the message of
[49:34] Brother Branam is yummy.
[49:37] [Laughter]
[49:38] Amen. We got uh saints that came in to
[49:43] comfort the family. And also if this is
[49:46] your first time or second time to come
[49:48] to the church, we just want everybody to
[49:51] stand. those that came first time and
[49:53] let's just welcome you in the name of
[49:56] the
[49:57] Lord. Thank you very much. God bless
[50:00] you. God bless you. God bless you.
[50:03] Welcome. Welcome to Spoken Way. You may

[50:19] richly bless you where you are. They're
[50:21] cooking some food. So, God bless you.
[50:23] Amen. Glory. Glory to God. I believe we
[50:26] are all up to date with the sermon.
[50:29] We're reading our Bible twice a day. Our
[50:31] cood book, Church Ages, 70 weeks of
[50:33] Daniel, the seals adoption. Or
[50:37] somebody is listening or reading the
[50:41] message of the hour. Amen.
[50:46] Glory to God. Our question and answer.
[50:48] I'm still waiting on the deacon to come
[50:50] up with the date, but uh married couple
[50:53] meeting, we will work it up and then
[50:55] tell you the date. It probably maybe two
[50:57] month or three month by God's grace. So,
[51:00] let's work up and make sure uh we got a
[51:03] a clear date. So if I sent you a date,
[51:06] you have probably 24 hours to respond
[51:10] back to me quickly if there is something
[51:12] that is blocking or or or you're not
[51:15] going to make it versus you sit quiet
[51:17] and then before you know it, this one is
[51:19] not going to be there. This one is not
[51:21] going to be there and we already prepare
[51:23] everything. So if I send a date, just
[51:25] respond quickly. You say, "Brother
[51:26] Stephen, I have something that is
[51:28] blocking so we can see if we can
[51:30] maneuver around the date because the
[51:32] venue is not ours." So we cannot
[51:34] definitely say that this is the date
[51:36] that we want. So just respond so we know
[51:39] exactly what to do. Amen. And Lord's
[51:41] willing on June the 7, that's when the
[51:44] youngs man is. We start with courtship
[51:47] and the building. You keep praying for
[51:49] us. You see what is going on there. But
[51:52] the cruise of oil and meal is running
[51:55] low. So we need some Elijah to speak the
[51:57] word. Amen.
[52:01] I I hope uh I believe you already
[52:04] understand my message. We need Sam
[52:06] Elijah to do what? Speak. Ah, we need
[52:08] somebody to speak the word, right,
[52:10] Sister Teresa? Uh, congratulation.
[52:13] Amen. Amen. Glory to God. So, make sure
[52:16] you keep praying and do what you got to
[52:18] do. Stay with faith. But brother set
[52:21] love some
[52:23] works. He's not here. He should have
[52:26] said amen. But he's in the back. Sooner
[52:28] he will be here. Amen. Glory to God. At
[52:31] the end of the service, I I thought it's
[52:34] going to be around 2:00, but it will be
[52:37] around 300 p.m. That's when the family
[52:40] will have a private viewing for the
[52:43] family. The public one, Lord's willing,
[52:45] I believe it will be tomorrow for those
[52:47] who can make it. But if somebody want to
[52:49] comfort the family and you plan to do it
[52:51] today when service is over, you can go
[52:54] straight to the house. You will see
[52:55] sister Pam's sister and the other one
[52:57] will be there. You can meet them. But
[52:59] just know that at 3:00 they will go
[53:01] privately and then come back again. So
[53:03] if you want to visit, you can go ahead.
[53:05] So there is no pressure with the time
[53:08] here. Everything is okay. So don't put
[53:11] any pressure like we need to go. No, no,
[53:13] no. Everything is okay. Amen. Give
[53:16] preeminence to the word. Brother Alvin
[53:18] is in a perfect place because he cleaned
[53:21] up everything and corrected everything
[53:23] and he went to be home with the Lord. So
[53:26] the prayer of a father and a mother have
[53:29] finally come to the Amen.
[53:33] [Applause]
[53:37] Amen. We should even learn how to be
[53:40] strong in times like this because she
[53:43] have all the right to stay home. But
[53:45] she's right here in the service with
[53:47] brother
[53:51] Andrew. So somebody's showing to the
[53:54] devil which side they are. Amen. Amen.
[53:58] Glory to God. So it's a celebration.
[54:01] It's not a morning. It's a celebration
[54:03] because we know with the fulfillment of
[54:05] the prophecy and everything, the Lord is
[54:08] coming sooner. Amen. If you were in the
[54:10] time of Ephesus, you can say, "Well,
[54:12] there is six more ages to go." Uhuh. We
[54:14] are not there. We in Laadia and the Pope
[54:17] is already there. And so there is not
[54:19] too long we will meet again with our
[54:22] loved one and never to be separated.
[54:25] Amen. Glory to God. On the other side
[54:28] I'm going to call brother Sabin and
[54:30] sister Espirans so you can see them
[54:33] first before we pray for them because
[54:35] they have 30 years of marriages. Amen.
[54:47] Glory to
[54:50] God. You can stand right
[54:55] here. God bless you, my brother. Thank
[54:57] you and congratulations.
[54:59] Congratulations, Sister HP. You can face
[55:02] the congregation so you see how they
[55:04] look. So, let's give the Lord a big clap
[55:06] offering.
[55:14] This is what we want to
[55:16] see. 30 years of
[55:20] marriage. Mate that came from eternity
[55:23] and they going back to eternity
[55:26] together. Amen.
[55:28] Amen. You can't hide this. Brother Seb,
[55:33] how do you feel?
[55:34] [Laughter]
[55:38] [Applause]
[55:40] I gave brother Manhattan a chance to
[55:43] speak. So there is no way I can let you
[55:45] sit here stand here without saying
[55:47] something. Just say something to the
[55:49] church so they hear. If I tell sister
[55:52] Esper, she will be she can't take that
[55:55] one. Amen. But brother Sabin, at least
[55:57] you can say something to the church. I
[56:00] can translate you if you want to.
[56:07] I don't have words.
[56:11] I can only say thank you to the Lord.
[56:16] 30 years of marriage is not easy.
[56:21] I was married when I was 26
[56:25] and my wife was 19.
[56:33] Uh it was an age we could forsake one
[56:36] another.
[56:38] But by the grace of God,
[56:41] we are here 30
[56:43] years
[56:51] together. Sister Esper, at least say one
[56:55] word. Just one word. You see the
[56:58] microphone is matching your dress.
[57:02] [Applause]
[57:08] I just want to say thank you to the
[57:10] Lord.
[57:14] 30 years it's not
[57:16] easy and I and I would like to say thank
[57:19] you to my pastor, brother Steven
[57:22] and for the whole church. Thank you.
[57:25] [Applause]
[57:30] Praise God. So let's pray for them. You
[57:34] pray with me together so that from now
[57:37] on God continue to bless them even more
[57:41] with all the training in married couple
[57:44] meeting. You are doomed for success.

[1:00:15] might be tired but JM is doing a good
[1:00:18] job but if you can I want this material
[1:00:20] to soak in very good. So when you get a
[1:00:23] chance if you can translate and make
[1:00:25] sure this is permeating completely so we
[1:00:28] can deal with certain things. Amen. If
[1:00:31] you do good today, then Lord's willing
[1:00:34] next Sunday I will pick up in Paul and
[1:00:37] pray. And then if you do good with Paul,
[1:00:39] then I pick up on what do you do when
[1:00:41] you are in season and what do you do
[1:00:44] when you are out of season? That's good.
[1:00:45] Then when you get there, we continue to
[1:00:47] move. If you do good,
[1:00:50] so you promise to do good. So let's
[1:00:53] pray. Heavenly Father, Lord, we are
[1:00:55] approaching you humbly this morning,
[1:00:57] Father. Lord, we thank you for your
[1:01:00] grace, for your love, your mercy, and
[1:01:02] for everything you have been doing for
[1:01:04] us. Father, this is as far as I can go
[1:01:07] with the ability that you have given me
[1:01:09] as a human being, Lord. But when it come
[1:01:12] to speaking to your bride and to
[1:01:14] blessing them, it's only a supernatural
[1:01:16] action of the Holy Spirit. Father, may
[1:01:19] you move me completely out of the way.
[1:01:21] May you come down and be the one
[1:01:23] preaching, the one interpreting and the
[1:01:25] one ministering to your people and
[1:01:27] blessing and healing because you are God
[1:01:29] who is all in all in us Lord. Father
[1:01:32] bless us and seal the devil completely
[1:01:34] out Lord. Father may you bring us
[1:01:36] together into focus into your word as we
[1:01:39] commit it all unto thy hand in Jesus
[1:01:42] precious name. Amen. Amen. Glory to God.
[1:01:45] Let's go to Jeremiah 29. Everybody
[1:01:49] looking good and I'm happy. Amen. When
[1:01:53] you look good, you need to smile. You
[1:01:55] cannot look good with a frown face.
[1:01:59] You look good, you smile.
[1:02:02] Amen.
[1:02:04] Amen. My son was telling my wife, he
[1:02:07] say, "Mama, you look good." I say, "Hey,
[1:02:09] what? How? How do you say you look good
[1:02:12] to my wife before I did
[1:02:17] it? I'm the one to do it first because
[1:02:20] she's my wife and he usually say mommy's
[1:02:24] mine. I say little
[1:02:27] lion wait till you grow up and your
[1:02:30] voice change and you start roaring.
[1:02:34] Have I say something wrong? Have I say
[1:02:36] something wrong? Ah, so it's at least
[1:02:38] it's relaxing. Right, brother Mickey?
[1:02:40] Ah,
[1:02:42] let's go to Jeremiah 29.
[1:02:46] Let's stay focused so we can drop this
[1:02:48] completely. Amen. Glory to God. My
[1:02:53] subject this
[1:02:55] morning is our life journey through
[1:02:59] Joseph's five garment part 61.
[1:03:07] How did you get there? My theme
[1:03:11] today is divine purpose.
[1:03:18] Are we there? Versus humanity.
[1:03:24] That's why I want you all to really
[1:03:26] focus. If you're sleeping, just know the
[1:03:29] devil don't want you to hear this. Wake
[1:03:32] up. So you see somebody sleeping, you
[1:03:35] just tell them, "God bless you."
[1:03:39] Let's go to Jeremiah 29 verse 11. If you
[1:03:43] dare, you can say amen. Amen. The Bible
[1:03:46] say for I know who knows you. God. Ah, I
[1:03:52] know the thoughts plural that I think
[1:03:56] toward you. So if nobody's thinking
[1:03:59] about you, God is thinking about you.
[1:04:03] [Music]
[1:04:04] There is a God in heaven who doesn't
[1:04:07] sleep nor slumber. He's thinking about
[1:04:09] you. Even when you feel like you're
[1:04:11] lonely, no, there is somebody thinking
[1:04:13] about you. There is a God in heaven. You
[1:04:16] may be seated. He says, "I know the
[1:04:19] thoughts that I have toward you." Amen,
[1:04:22] says the Lord. Thoughts of
[1:04:25] peace and not of evil to give you an
[1:04:30] expected end.
[1:04:32] So the beginning of the thoughts of God
[1:04:36] when we are dealing with the thoughts of
[1:04:38] God toward us in the beginning.
[1:04:42] Amen. They are thoughts of
[1:04:45] peace. They are good thoughts. Amen.
[1:04:48] Amen. And the
[1:04:52] ending is also good.
[1:04:56] It's
[1:04:57] hopeful. It's expected.
[1:05:01] Are we together? If you notice, God is
[1:05:04] talking about the beginning, right?
[1:05:07] Amen.
[1:05:08] And he's talking about the ending
[1:05:11] because he himself is the beginning.
[1:05:14] Amen. Amen, brother. Amen. And the
[1:05:16] ending.
[1:05:18] Because once you get the beginning and
[1:05:20] the ending locked,
[1:05:24] whatever happen in between is nothing.
[1:05:27] You must secure the beginning.
[1:05:31] Are we together? And then you secure the
[1:05:34] end.
[1:05:36] If you secure the beginning and the end,
[1:05:39] whatever is in between have to uh adjust
[1:05:43] itself.
[1:05:48] To become the end.
[1:05:51] I don't know if you Okay. In other
[1:05:54] words, whatever the devil is doing here,
[1:05:57] just know that the end is going to be
[1:05:59] good.
[1:06:00] Because the beginning is already good.
[1:06:03] And God sees the ending in the
[1:06:05] beginning. From the beginning, he
[1:06:08] already seen the ending. That's why he's
[1:06:10] alpha and omega. That's why he's the A
[1:06:13] and the Z. He's the Reuben and the
[1:06:16] Benjamin. The beginning and the end, the
[1:06:20] amen of God. Amen. Are we together?
[1:06:25] Are we together? I got thoughts that I'm
[1:06:28] thinking. thoughts of peace, good
[1:06:30] thoughts to give you an expected end, a
[1:06:33] good and hopeful, something good up
[1:06:35] there. If you notice, he doesn't say
[1:06:37] anything about what is in between.
[1:06:40] Follow me carefully.
[1:06:42] Are we together? Are we together? Let's
[1:06:45] go to 1 Corinthian chapter 2.
[1:06:50] Oh, glory to
[1:06:53] God. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen.
[1:07:02] Uh, I'm sorry for those on the camera.
[1:07:06] Every time I take my jacket off, the
[1:07:08] camera readjusts to the color and then
[1:07:12] make it a little bit darker, especially
[1:07:14] when it's auto. So, people say the image
[1:07:16] is a little bit
[1:07:18] darker. I got a projector behind me. So,
[1:07:21] just to give you some answers. 1
[1:07:25] Corinthian 2. If you dare, you can say
[1:07:27] amen. Amen. Verse seven, please follow
[1:07:29] me
[1:07:31] carefully. I wish all of you were here.
[1:07:35] Amen. Amen. Verse seven. You there? Yes,
[1:07:39] sir. The Bible say, "But we speak,"
[1:07:44] are we clear? Amen. Yes. The wisdom of
[1:07:47] God. You know who the wisdom of God is,
[1:07:50] right?
[1:07:53] Yes, sir. Amen. Amen. Uh stay right
[1:07:57] there. Go to chapter one because I don't
[1:08:01] want people to say brother Stephen say
[1:08:03] go to chapter one verse 24. Can you read
[1:08:07] with me? But to them which are called
[1:08:10] both who
[1:08:12] and Jews and Greeks Christ the what? God
[1:08:18] and the what?
[1:08:20] So the wisdom of God is who? Christ. We
[1:08:23] clear now. Now let's go back to second
[1:08:26] chapter 2 verse
[1:08:28] 7 and Paul say we speak what
[1:08:34] in other word we we we are preaching
[1:08:36] about who we clear now we preach Christ
[1:08:40] amen we speak the wisdom of God how
[1:08:45] the mystery Paul was preaching how
[1:08:48] mystery mystery so why are we having a
[1:08:50] problem with a
[1:08:51] mystery that's mystery Good question.
[1:08:57] He said we speak the wisdom of God. How?
[1:09:01] In a mystery. In a mystery. What type of
[1:09:04] mystery? Come on. Even the what? Hidden
[1:09:07] wisdom. So it's not a crust that
[1:09:10] everybody knows.
[1:09:14] We are preaching a crust that has been
[1:09:16] hidden.
[1:09:18] A crust that you can look, you can read
[1:09:20] the Bible and you won't see that crust
[1:09:23] until the Lord open up to you.
[1:09:26] It's an intimate crust.
[1:09:29] It's a crust that only revealed to his
[1:09:32] own elect.
[1:09:33] I hope we are together. And Paul say we
[1:09:36] preach that Christ in a mystery. Amen.
[1:09:40] Even the what? The hidden mystery of
[1:09:42] God. Amen. The hidden mystery which
[1:09:47] God did what? Ordained. Ordain or
[1:09:50] predestinated
[1:09:52] or prepare?
[1:09:54] Ordain before the world to our what?
[1:09:59] Glory. So the mystery of God, the
[1:10:02] purpose of it, Yes sir. Yes sir. is to
[1:10:05] do what? For our glory. For our glory.
[1:10:08] For the glory of who? Us. So the purpose
[1:10:11] of the mystery of God is for our glory.
[1:10:15] So if you see the mystery of God being
[1:10:18] revealed that's why brother Brandham
[1:10:20] preach Christ is the mystery of God.
[1:10:24] What it is for our glory. So you should
[1:10:28] love mysteries
[1:10:30] especially when they are open because a
[1:10:33] reveal mystery is for your glory. Are we
[1:10:37] together? Amen. So God had a hidden
[1:10:40] mystery
[1:10:44] before the foundation of the world.
[1:10:47] Amen. Before the foundation of the word,
[1:10:51] the world God have a hidden mystery.
[1:10:54] Amen.
[1:10:57] And Paul is saying that that mystery the
[1:11:00] purpose
[1:11:02] the destination
[1:11:05] the address.
[1:11:07] Yes. Where they have to deliver that
[1:11:09] mystery. It is for our
[1:11:13] glory.
[1:11:16] Amen. So now we know the beginning is a
[1:11:19] good mystery. And the end is going to
[1:11:22] bring our glory.
[1:11:25] So if you want your glory, you need to
[1:11:27] find the mystery. That's right. Amen.
[1:11:29] Okay. Are we together? Are we together?
[1:11:33] We clear now. Amen. Now, how do we get
[1:11:36] from a hidden mystery to the mystery
[1:11:39] becoming our glory?
[1:11:43] We clear? Yes, sir. Verse eight. You
[1:11:46] will need your scripture, your Bible.
[1:11:48] The Bible say that mystery which none of
[1:11:52] the princes
[1:11:54] of this world knew.
[1:11:58] Watch out. None of them. Are we
[1:12:00] together? The princes. None of them
[1:12:03] knew.
[1:12:04] For had they know it, in other words, if
[1:12:08] they would have known what God have in
[1:12:11] reserve for you.
[1:12:16] If what if if they would have known your
[1:12:19] package of glory,
[1:12:22] are we together? Follow me, my friend.
[1:12:25] The Bible say they would not have what?
[1:12:28] Crucified crucified the Lord of what?
[1:12:31] Glory. In other word, if they would have
[1:12:34] known that what I'm doing now, come on.
[1:12:38] Come on. Will bless brother Charles.
[1:12:45] The devil would have left it alone.
[1:12:48] I I don't know if we together.
[1:12:51] I'm trying to leave the airport, my
[1:12:53] friend. Amen. If they would have known
[1:12:57] the mystery, they would not have killed
[1:13:00] Jesus Christ. That's right.
[1:13:05] Are we together? So God blinded them.
[1:13:10] Amen. Because what God purpose must
[1:13:13] happen.
[1:13:17] Are we together? God blinded them so
[1:13:19] that they can crucify Jesus Christ. Is
[1:13:23] the crucifixion good or bad?
[1:13:26] [Applause]
[1:13:27] Today you see how you answering now.
[1:13:30] Yes. Do you know the crucifixion? The
[1:13:33] crucifixion means they put you naked
[1:13:38] before your mother
[1:13:41] and your father, before your friends,
[1:13:45] they nail you at the cross. They spit on
[1:13:48] you and they make fun of you. Is it
[1:13:51] good?
[1:13:53] But without that, your glory cannot
[1:13:56] come.
[1:13:58] Amen. Amen. I hope we together.
[1:14:02] [Music]
[1:14:04] I hope we are together. Remember to
[1:14:06] develop your picture, we need trouble.
[1:14:09] [Applause]
[1:14:13] Amen. Amen. Are you still elementary or
[1:14:16] what? To develop your picture, we still
[1:14:20] need trouble because without trouble,
[1:14:22] God blinded them.
[1:14:27] Amen. Amen.
[1:14:30] Do you know why they crucified Jesus
[1:14:32] Christ?
[1:14:34] Do you know
[1:14:35] why they crucify
[1:14:38] Joseph? I'm saying that that way. Do you
[1:14:41] know why they sold Joseph?
[1:14:47] Hallelujah. You there? The Bible says in
[1:14:50] Acts
[1:14:51] 7:9, the patriarch
[1:14:56] patriarch
[1:14:59] moved with what? Envy. Jealousy.
[1:15:03] Amen. And did what? Sold Joseph into
[1:15:06] Egypt. But God was with him. Amen. That
[1:15:10] jealousy was important.
[1:15:12] [Applause]
[1:15:14] [Music]
[1:15:15] I hope we are together. Without
[1:15:18] jealousy, no glory.
[1:15:21] Without jealousy against Joseph, no
[1:15:24] glory in Egypt. It takes jealousy to
[1:15:27] send Joseph to the destination.
[1:15:30] I hope we are together. And Joseph was a
[1:15:33] perfect type of Jesus Christ. If Joseph
[1:15:37] was sent to his destination by jealousy,
[1:15:40] what do you expect Jesus Christ to be
[1:15:42] sent to his destination? By what?
[1:15:44] Jealousy. Ah, the Bible says in Mark
[1:15:48] 15:9, "But
[1:15:50] Pilate answered them, saying, "What will
[1:15:54] ye that I release unto you the king of
[1:15:56] the Jews?" For he knew
[1:16:01] that the chief priest have delivered him
[1:16:03] for what? Envy.
[1:16:09] But the chief priest moved the people
[1:16:12] that they that that that he should
[1:16:14] rather release who
[1:16:17] in other word even when the Jews say
[1:16:20] crucify him, it was not them.
[1:16:23] It was the teaching of the Pharisee.
[1:16:28] It was the anointing for the Pharisee
[1:16:30] that entered the people and they begin
[1:16:33] to call for the blood of Jesus Christ.
[1:16:36] It was the anointing from the minister,
[1:16:40] [Applause]
[1:16:43] the anointing from the preachers,
[1:16:47] the anointing from the pastor and that
[1:16:50] anointing enter the
[1:16:52] congregation and the congregation begin
[1:16:54] to hurt so and so when you have not done
[1:16:58] anything, it is for your glory.
[1:17:04] Amen.
[1:17:07] Are we together? It is for your glory.
[1:17:10] [Applause]
[1:17:12] Are we together? Are we together? Are we
[1:17:15] together?
[1:17:17] I'm going to show you how you deal with
[1:17:19] this type of stuff. God has a mystery
[1:17:23] for you. And that mystery is for your
[1:17:26] glory. But to develop the picture.
[1:17:30] Amen. Amen. Somebody must be moved by
[1:17:34] jealousy. Yes.
[1:17:39] To do what? To crucify.
[1:17:43] Uh who? The prince of peace.
[1:17:50] So your package was carried by who?
[1:17:55] The prince of peace.
[1:17:58] So they have to poke the prince of peace
[1:18:00] to release your package.
[1:18:04] If you keep the priest of peace, he's
[1:18:06] holding your package. They got to poke
[1:18:08] him.
[1:18:10] When they poke him, he relieves your
[1:18:12] glory.
[1:18:14] I hope we are together. Are you
[1:18:17] following me? Are we together?
[1:18:21] Hallelujah.
[1:18:24] Brother Brham says that we live in three
[1:18:27] different realms. Do you remember that?
[1:18:30] If you don't remember, raise your hand.
[1:18:36] Nobody. If you shy, that's your problem.
[1:18:39] Brother Brandham say we live in a
[1:18:42] humanistic level realm. We live in the
[1:18:46] revelation
[1:18:48] and brother Brandham say we live in
[1:18:50] vision.
[1:18:52] These are the three realms. He say human
[1:18:55] level is hope.
[1:18:58] He say revelation is faith. And brother
[1:19:02] Brandham say vision is that saith the
[1:19:04] Lord.
[1:19:07] Amen. And brother Brandham say this one
[1:19:10] is perfect.
[1:19:14] Are we together? We found out follow me
[1:19:17] my friend that according to Ecclesiastic
[1:19:21] 3 there are three elements that goes
[1:19:24] with our prayer. Follow me carefully.
[1:19:26] Put your seat belt my friend.
[1:19:29] When you pray God, God answer every
[1:19:33] prayer.
[1:19:38] We already went through this. And the
[1:19:40] answer is either yes
[1:19:44] or either no,
[1:19:48] but it's still an answer.
[1:19:51] Are we together? Amen. And the way we
[1:19:53] were brought up in this world and in
[1:19:56] this message,
[1:19:58] we think that God answer prayer when he
[1:20:01] only say yes.
[1:20:06] If you ask somebody, what about your
[1:20:08] prayer? Huh? God did not answer my
[1:20:10] prayer. What we actually are saying? We
[1:20:13] are saying God did not say yes.
[1:20:19] Because answering our prayer means yes.
[1:20:23] In other word, every time you go to your
[1:20:26] natural father, brother to ask
[1:20:29] something, he must say yes.
[1:20:35] I'm going this way, my friend. But even
[1:20:38] our natural father says no.
[1:20:41] Does he mean he doesn't love you? No,
[1:20:43] sir. Are we together? So answering
[1:20:47] prayer doesn't mean yes.
[1:20:51] Even when God say no, God have answered
[1:20:54] your prayer.
[1:20:56] Even when God stay silenc.
[1:21:00] [Applause]
[1:21:04] Are we together? I will get to that. God
[1:21:07] answer your prayer. But we found out
[1:21:10] that what is the problem with our
[1:21:12] answering prayer.
[1:21:14] The way we were brought up is you pray
[1:21:16] it happen. Oh hallelujah. God love me.
[1:21:19] When I pray everything I pray God
[1:21:22] answer. You are saying that everything
[1:21:23] you pray you get it.
[1:21:26] When you didn't get it you say oh God
[1:21:28] didn't hear my prayer and you have a
[1:21:31] tendency to go back
[1:21:34] and to begin to reinforce that area.
[1:21:38] And the way you reinforcing is because
[1:21:40] you think God have not heard you. Right.
[1:21:43] Right. Amen. I hope we are going
[1:21:45] together. I hope we are. In other words,
[1:21:48] when you are assisting to God, you are
[1:21:51] actually telling him, "You have not
[1:21:53] heard my prayer yet." When God already
[1:21:56] heard you from the beginning,
[1:22:00] I hope we are going together. But the
[1:22:03] reason why the answer is not coming
[1:22:05] along is because there is a principle in
[1:22:09] the earth.
[1:22:12] Amen. Amen. Amen. And the principle is
[1:22:16] to everything there is what and a time
[1:22:20] to what? Every purpose where under the
[1:22:23] heaven. So in this world just remember
[1:22:25] your prayer go with three element. Amen.
[1:22:29] Are we together? The first element is
[1:22:32] timing.
[1:22:34] The second element is a season. Amen.
[1:22:37] The third element is what?
[1:22:41] We already went through this. We are
[1:22:42] dealing with purpose. Amen. Amen. If
[1:22:46] those three element are not line up,
[1:22:49] right? That's right. God won't respond.
[1:22:53] [Music]
[1:22:56] But it doesn't mean God didn't heal you.
[1:22:59] Amen. I'm giving you time, so it's
[1:23:02] soaking in pretty good. Thank you. In
[1:23:05] other word, you can pray today
[1:23:09] and God will answer you when you are
[1:23:11] dead.
[1:23:15] Glory to God. Yes sir.
[1:23:18] Can you put your seat belt? Yes sir. I'm
[1:23:20] trying to preach is brother Glenn. I
[1:23:22] want him there so he can holler. Amen.
[1:23:24] From that corner over there. H brother
[1:23:26] set his back. So let me preach now. Ah.
[1:23:29] Amen.
[1:23:30] In other words, they are prayer that
[1:23:32] will be answered quickly.
[1:23:35] They are prayer that will take years
[1:23:39] and they are prayer that you won't see
[1:23:41] even yourself the result of it
[1:23:50] you see how you do you want me to switch
[1:23:52] sermon or do we want to go together?
[1:23:57] God told Israel,
[1:23:59] Abraham, your people will go to surgeon
[1:24:02] in Egypt
[1:24:04] for how many years? If you slowing me
[1:24:07] down, you got to pay my time back. You
[1:24:10] going to go to Egypt? Uh I mean to
[1:24:12] Egypt, how long? 400 years. Okay. How
[1:24:15] how many people live 400 years? So in
[1:24:19] other words, those that went to Egypt,
[1:24:21] all of them died.
[1:24:24] So if you are praying, you say, "God,
[1:24:26] come and deliver us from Pharaoh." Your
[1:24:30] prayer will be heard, but he won't be
[1:24:32] answered until 400 years.
[1:24:37] [Applause]
[1:24:40] Are we together? Are we together? Let me
[1:24:44] explain it this way so somebody
[1:24:46] understand it. Yes sir. God have a have
[1:24:51] a
[1:24:52] uh a place
[1:24:56] in heaven. God have reservoir.
[1:25:02] He have a pot. I'm I'm just making a leg
[1:25:05] restriction. So don't come after me say
[1:25:07] where is the pot. Uhuh. God has a pot.
[1:25:11] Amen. That pot receive prayers. Yes sir.
[1:25:16] Amen. Amen. So when you pray, your
[1:25:18] prayer goes and sit there.
[1:25:21] And some prayer can go and leave God
[1:25:24] quickly.
[1:25:27] And they don't linger over there. But
[1:25:30] some prayer will linger for a long time.
[1:25:33] But they are still in the presence of
[1:25:35] the Lord
[1:25:37] until the time comes
[1:25:40] and the season comes and the purpose
[1:25:43] line up together. Then your prayer will
[1:25:46] leave that pot
[1:25:48] [Applause]
[1:25:49] and bring your answers. But from the
[1:25:52] very first day, Daniel, you pray,
[1:25:56] I already heard you, but it takes 21
[1:25:59] days for me to bring the
[1:26:02] [Applause]
[1:26:04] answers. Amen.
[1:26:08] Brother Brham says this we climbing my
[1:26:10] friend in the message the bridge between
[1:26:12] the seven church ages and the seven
[1:26:14] seal. Brother Brham is reading the book
[1:26:17] of revelation. Brother Brham say when he
[1:26:20] had taken the book the four beasts and
[1:26:23] the four and 20 elders did what? fell
[1:26:26] down before the lamb having every one of
[1:26:28] them water the heart and golden vow full
[1:26:32] of water which are the prayers of who
[1:26:36] the saints so the prayer of the saint
[1:26:39] were held right amen by the elder follow
[1:26:43] me my friend and brother Brandham
[1:26:46] continue he interpret this he say that
[1:26:49] is those that are where under the altar
[1:26:52] that have prayed for what long ago Amen.
[1:26:56] Are we together? They had prayed for
[1:26:59] what? Redemption. But it was not time
[1:27:02] for redemption yet.
[1:27:04] Amen. So God was holding their prayer.
[1:27:07] Yes, sir. Because the time of the
[1:27:09] redemption didn't come yet. But God
[1:27:12] already agree with the prayer, but the
[1:27:14] prayer cannot be answered because Jesus
[1:27:16] is not born yet.
[1:27:19] [Music]
[1:27:20] Are we together? I'm trying to free your
[1:27:23] anxiety. Brother Brham said they had
[1:27:25] prayed for what? Redemption. They have
[1:27:27] prayed for what? Resurrection. So how
[1:27:30] can the resurrection come when the lamb
[1:27:32] is not killed yet?
[1:27:34] So the prayer goes and sit into heaven.
[1:27:40] Are we together? Brother Brham say these
[1:27:43] elders are pouring out what?
[1:27:47] Their prayer. Preach with me my friend.
[1:27:49] Because now we got the what?
[1:27:51] Representative. We got the kingsman
[1:27:53] where in heaven that is coming forth to
[1:27:56] make what is claimed. So when the time
[1:27:58] of redemption is coming now all the
[1:28:01] prayer that have been there since the
[1:28:03] old testament job and all the other one
[1:28:06] that say I know my redeemer liveth now
[1:28:09] they can take those prayer and pour it
[1:28:11] down. In other words the answer is
[1:28:13] coming when job already died.
[1:28:19] I hope we are together. I hope you are
[1:28:22] following me. Brother Brham says this.
[1:28:25] Let's stay focused my friend. Brother
[1:28:27] Brham says in the message the baptism uh
[1:28:30] uh the the baptismal service. Brother
[1:28:33] Brham say heavenly
[1:28:35] father 1900 years since the scripture
[1:28:38] has been written and your promise is
[1:28:40] what? Still moving on. And now Lord here
[1:28:44] these young people follow me my friend
[1:28:47] these two young ladies standing here to
[1:28:49] my right they have accepted you as their
[1:28:53] savior they believe the gospel story to
[1:28:57] the right we clear to my left Lord is my
[1:29:01] little nephew Melvin and my own boy
[1:29:06] I don't know whether it was Billy Paul
[1:29:07] or who he said but I believe it's Billy
[1:29:10] Paul because hope was
[1:29:14] Yes, sir. Don't worry, my friend. He
[1:29:16] said, "To my left, Lord, is my little
[1:29:18] nephew." Who? Melvin and my own boy. So,
[1:29:22] we got Melvin and brother Brandham on
[1:29:24] boy. Oh, God. If it's possible this
[1:29:27] morning, that two mothers
[1:29:31] could be called to look over the
[1:29:33] banister.
[1:29:35] Those mothers already died. Right there.
[1:29:38] Yes, sir. The mother of Melvin died.
[1:29:42] Hope died. Are we together? If they can
[1:29:46] call them to look over the banister, to
[1:29:49] look down and see the boys now. Oh, how
[1:29:54] happy I am, Lord. Oh, to know that you
[1:29:58] answer what? Prayer. That poor little
[1:30:01] mother roof, she's gone on for her what?
[1:30:04] years ago. And but her prayer is
[1:30:07] answered now.
[1:30:13] That's why you need a prophet. Her
[1:30:16] prayer is answer. She prayed that he
[1:30:19] will love you and serve you. He's making
[1:30:22] his stand when this morning. So God
[1:30:25] answers prayer.
[1:30:29] Lord,
[1:30:32] the mother was already gone, but the
[1:30:34] prayer is still there because it was not
[1:30:37] time yet. It was not the season yet. It
[1:30:41] was not the purpose yet. But when the
[1:30:44] time and the season and the purpose line
[1:30:46] up, even if you dead, God will honor his
[1:30:50] word. Amen.
[1:30:55] Mother never lose hope for children.
[1:30:59] Father never lose hope for children. No
[1:31:02] matter how long it take, God answer your
[1:31:05] prayer. Whether you alive or not, God
[1:31:08] answer your prayer.
[1:31:12] Amen.
[1:31:15] Amen. Are we together? Amen. Are we
[1:31:18] together? Listen to this, my friend.
[1:31:21] Brother Brham says this. He says, "And
[1:31:24] to show how to show you how slow it
[1:31:28] comes."
[1:31:30] I waited myself for a next from God. For
[1:31:34] what? A vision. That say the Lord for
[1:31:37] how many years? 15 years.
[1:31:40] [Music]
[1:31:42] God showed you. You got a vision, but
[1:31:45] it's not fulfilled yet.
[1:31:50] Glory. God already answered the prayer,
[1:31:53] but it's not time yet. I'm helping you
[1:31:56] to remove anxiety.
[1:31:58] We should be calm. We should be
[1:32:01] peaceful. Once you pray, chill out.
[1:32:10] All I'm waiting for is the time, the
[1:32:13] season, and the purpose.
[1:32:16] Hallelujah. If the devil comes, he say
[1:32:19] God didn't hear your prayer. You say,
[1:32:21] "Devil, let me preach you about the
[1:32:24] time, about the season, about the
[1:32:27] purpose. My prayer are always answering
[1:32:32] because I am Jesus Christ.
[1:32:35] Jesus prayer is always answered and I am
[1:32:39] of the same DNA the same lineage sir of
[1:32:43] Jesus Christ sir
[1:32:47] [Applause]
[1:32:48] I hope we are together are we together
[1:32:52] are we together brotherham say he had a
[1:32:55] vision if you have a vision right now
[1:32:58] you know how you will scream you will
[1:33:00] tell everybody
[1:33:03] it's going to happen. It's going to
[1:33:05] happen 15 years.
[1:33:13] Abraham
[1:33:14] 25 years.
[1:33:17] [Applause]
[1:33:21] So we go back to God. We say, "Lord, can
[1:33:23] you give me that one? You already got a
[1:33:24] vision.
[1:33:34] Can I continue? Uhhuh. Brother say he
[1:33:38] waited for how long, my friend? 15
[1:33:40] years. And then another come and won't
[1:33:43] have to wait but what? Three minutes.
[1:33:47] Why is one 3 minute and another one 15
[1:33:51] minute? There is an element of purpose,
[1:33:55] an element of season.
[1:33:58] Both prayer are
[1:34:01] but the timing is different. The season
[1:34:04] is different.
[1:34:09] Brother Brandham say he have to wait by
[1:34:11] what? Three minutes. It's God answer in
[1:34:15] his own time. We don't control it. He
[1:34:18] control us.
[1:34:20] [Applause]
[1:34:25] Amen. Why you discouraged to pray? Uh
[1:34:28] because God don't answer me. Who told
[1:34:30] you God doesn't answer you? Uh because
[1:34:33] you have your time. And because it
[1:34:36] didn't happen on your time, you think
[1:34:38] God didn't hear you. God heard you. But
[1:34:41] your time must match with his time
[1:34:44] because his time is always perfect.
[1:34:52] Are we together? Are we together? Are we
[1:34:56] together? We're dealing with the
[1:34:58] purpose, my friend. My God.
[1:35:01] Amen. When it comes to divine purpose,
[1:35:04] the Bible says this according to
[1:35:06] Ephesians 1 verse 11. The Bible say, "In
[1:35:10] whom also we have obtained what?"
[1:35:12] Inheritance. Being how?
[1:35:15] According to the purpose
[1:35:19] of what? Of him, not your purpose.
[1:35:23] The purpose of God who does what?
[1:35:26] Workketh all things after the counsel of
[1:35:29] what? His own will. In other words, the
[1:35:32] purpose of God for your life is the will
[1:35:36] of God.
[1:35:39] Yes, sir.
[1:35:40] the purpose of God for your life is the
[1:35:43] will of God.
[1:35:46] Are we together? Amen. And because it's
[1:35:49] the will of God
[1:35:51] because it's the purpose of God. Are we
[1:35:54] together? God will work everything
[1:35:59] everything
[1:36:01] toward the fulfillment of what he
[1:36:04] planned.
[1:36:06] Amen. Amen. Amen.
[1:36:10] In other word, every devil devil that
[1:36:13] comes to your life
[1:36:17] before he begin to deal with you, God
[1:36:20] will push the break and say when you
[1:36:24] enter this life, you can only push one,
[1:36:27] two, three.
[1:36:30] Yes sir. That's why he limit the devil
[1:36:34] with job.
[1:36:36] He said push here, push here. But don't
[1:36:38] touch his life. Amen. Because I'm trying
[1:36:41] to make a statement sir that even if you
[1:36:45] remove everything, Job is perfect.
[1:36:49] Job will stand on my word.
[1:36:55] Because God already said Job is perfect.
[1:36:58] He's proving to the devil that what I
[1:37:01] say is what it is.
[1:37:07] Are we together? Are we together my
[1:37:09] friend? Are we together? The purpose of
[1:37:12] God is his will. It's what God want to
[1:37:16] achieve.
[1:37:17] And because God want to achieve
[1:37:19] something, everything else have to work
[1:37:23] to match that purpose.
[1:37:26] [Applause]
[1:37:29] Amen. In other words, what comes in your
[1:37:31] life, just know that it's going to match
[1:37:34] the purpose.
[1:37:35] There is nothing that can come into your
[1:37:38] life that will deviate you from the
[1:37:40] purpose.
[1:37:47] In other word, your test have been
[1:37:49] predestinated.
[1:37:52] Your trial are predestinated.
[1:37:55] That's why the Bible say he cannot give
[1:37:58] you more than you can handle because he
[1:38:01] will be against his purpose. You must be
[1:38:04] able to handle it so he keep you in the
[1:38:07] purpose. It keep you on the highway.
[1:38:12] [Applause]
[1:38:13] You will see somebody saying how can
[1:38:15] that sister survive that event? No, that
[1:38:19] sister was built for that event. Amen.
[1:38:24] Amen.
[1:38:30] That brother was built for that event.
[1:38:33] You are not built for that. It's an
[1:38:36] individual affair. Amen.
[1:38:39] Oh, glory to God.
[1:38:41] [Applause]
[1:38:42] Do you follow me? Yes, sir. Are we
[1:38:44] together? Are we together? Because the
[1:38:48] will of God is the purpose of God. And
[1:38:52] because the purpose of God, God is the
[1:38:54] one that rules everything. He will work
[1:38:57] everything to work together for good to
[1:39:01] them that are called according to his
[1:39:05] purpose.
[1:39:08] Are we together? That's why brother
[1:39:10] Brham says this
[1:39:13] and we come on such a morning
[1:39:17] to gather what? Hopes some what? new
[1:39:20] hopes of what we are here for and what
[1:39:23] is the purpose and I think that this is
[1:39:26] a wonderful time to think on the hopes
[1:39:29] that God has done what given us. Now we
[1:39:31] want to draw this first into our mind
[1:39:35] that there is not what
[1:39:38] that can destroy us until the purpose.
[1:39:42] Yes sir. Yes sir. Yes sir.
[1:39:46] If they destroy you, they're destroying
[1:39:49] the will of God.
[1:39:53] But no one is greater than God.
[1:39:56] And he that is in you is greater than he
[1:39:59] that is in the world.
[1:40:02] Yes, sir.
[1:40:04] Hallelujah. My friend, I don't care what
[1:40:06] the devil did in your life. Me, I don't
[1:40:08] joke.
[1:40:10] [Applause]
[1:40:12] Why should I be sad? Amen. Why should I
[1:40:16] be sad? There is nothing.
[1:40:21] Even if the wheelbarrow is going down,
[1:40:23] it's not a problem for me. I didn't
[1:40:26] start this church. The one who started
[1:40:28] must provide.
[1:40:31] [Applause]
[1:40:37] Are we to God? Are we together? If not,
[1:40:40] you will compromise because so and so
[1:40:43] have more money in the church. You
[1:40:45] cannot correct them. If you need to
[1:40:47] leave, leave.
[1:40:49] But God will take care of his church.
[1:40:51] Amen.
[1:40:54] [Applause]
[1:40:56] I am not depending on you. I'm depending
[1:40:58] on the master.
[1:41:04] Are we together? Are we together?
[1:41:06] Because I must be free to deliver the
[1:41:09] message without compromise.
[1:41:12] [Applause]
[1:41:15] Are we together? Are we together? He
[1:41:18] says, "Let's go, my friend." He said,
[1:41:19] "There is what? Not one thing that can
[1:41:22] do what? Destroy us." Continue. Until
[1:41:25] the purpose of he until the purpose of
[1:41:28] he who created us has been what?
[1:41:31] Fulfilled. So if you are dead today,
[1:41:34] just know your purpose has been
[1:41:36] accomplished.
[1:41:39] Amen.
[1:41:41] [Applause]
[1:41:44] Hallelujah. You didn't get me. As a
[1:41:48] parent, we have our purpose for our
[1:41:51] children. But God have a purpose for
[1:41:53] your child. So according to your purpose
[1:41:57] parent you might think you want your
[1:41:59] child to do this this this then go to
[1:42:01] heaven that is your purpose but God has
[1:42:04] his own purpose so where God stop that's
[1:42:07] where your child will stop it might not
[1:42:10] match your purpose but it's matching his
[1:42:13] purpose that's what matter
[1:42:17] [Applause]
[1:42:20] you don't understand me a parent is
[1:42:22] mechanic he want his children to be
[1:42:25] mechanic.
[1:42:26] A parent is a doctor. He want his child
[1:42:29] to be the doctor to take over at the
[1:42:31] practice. Who told you your child was
[1:42:33] born to be a doctor?
[1:42:36] [Applause]
[1:42:38] And before you know it, people in the
[1:42:41] message has been pushed to fix they
[1:42:44] don't like
[1:42:46] because it was not God purpose. It was
[1:42:49] the parent purpose. But parent now we
[1:42:52] need to learn. Watch the child. See
[1:42:56] where God want him to be and let him go.
[1:42:59] Amen.
[1:43:01] Because when you are in your purpose,
[1:43:03] you got power.
[1:43:05] Amen.
[1:43:11] [Applause]
[1:43:14] We we created our own problem. There is
[1:43:17] money in this. Everybody get there.
[1:43:21] Who told you it was yours?
[1:43:27] It might be for brother so and so, but
[1:43:30] not for you. Make sure it's your
[1:43:32] purpose. Because if it's your purpose,
[1:43:35] then it's a different story.
[1:43:42] [Applause]
[1:43:46] There were disciple that were in the
[1:43:48] boat. All of them struggling the same
[1:43:51] thing.
[1:43:53] Do you follow me? And Jesus come
[1:43:55] walking. Not all of them say we want to
[1:43:58] walk. The one who was designed
[1:44:01] to walk on the water. Something move
[1:44:04] him. That was Peter. He said, "Father,
[1:44:08] if it's you, let him come." Why didn't
[1:44:11] the other do that?
[1:44:13] And watch, my friend, because it was his
[1:44:16] purpose. When he begin to walk, he got
[1:44:19] distracted and begin to sink. He sent a
[1:44:23] prayer. He said, "Father,
[1:44:26] save me." Because he was in his purpose.
[1:44:30] God answered that prayer.
[1:44:34] When you are in your line of duty, all
[1:44:37] prayer are answered.
[1:44:40] [Applause]
[1:44:42] Yes, sir. In other word, if God told me
[1:44:46] to start this business, if something
[1:44:48] happened with the business, I go back to
[1:44:50] God.
[1:44:54] [Applause]
[1:44:58] We are not in the age of trying. You try
[1:45:02] this one, you leave it. This one, you
[1:45:04] leave it. Before you know it, you lose
[1:45:05] money here. You lose money here. You
[1:45:07] lose money here. You lose because you
[1:45:09] don't know your purpose. That's it. I
[1:45:11] don't move until I know.
[1:45:16] [Music]
[1:45:18] And when I move it with
[1:45:20] precision, brother, I don't know if
[1:45:23] you're getting me. It is not the purpose
[1:45:25] of our parent. No, sir. It is not the
[1:45:28] purpose of what we want. It is the
[1:45:31] purpose of God. Amen.
[1:45:37] Are we together? Are we together?
[1:45:41] Brother Panam say that could be what?
[1:45:44] Nothing. We were made for what? A
[1:45:46] purpose.

[1:45:53] You went to be a builder.
[1:45:56] That's why you uncomfortable.
[1:45:58] [Applause]
[1:46:01] You see the other the builder are happy
[1:46:03] but you are not happy. Find am I in the
[1:46:06] right place? Because brother Brandham
[1:46:08] say when you find your position it give
[1:46:10] you a constant satisfaction.
[1:46:13] [Applause]
[1:46:15] If not you are following the peace.

[1:46:21] what God want you to do.
[1:46:27] If not you going to have a big diploma.
[1:46:30] No work. No work. A lot of people in
[1:46:33] America under student loan. don't work
[1:46:36] for what they went to college because we
[1:46:39] were pushed into pipes.
[1:46:42] Hallelujah.
[1:46:44] [Music]
[1:46:46] But now God is opening your eyes.
[1:46:49] Are we together? Because the purpose of
[1:46:52] God is his will and he will do
[1:46:55] everything to work the purpose together
[1:46:58] to match his will. Are we together?
[1:47:01] Brother Brham says this, "My friend,
[1:47:04] God's purpose can what? Never be
[1:47:06] defeated. There is nothing can do what?
[1:47:09] So how happy ought to uh ought to we to
[1:47:12] be today doing what resting upon that
[1:47:14] beautiful upon that beautiful revelation
[1:47:17] of the word of the living God that there
[1:47:20] is neither what being present nor things
[1:47:24] that come.
[1:47:27] That's it. That's it. No things what
[1:47:30] present or whatever.
[1:47:32] Should I worry about the future? No. So
[1:47:35] whatever is coming in the future, it
[1:47:37] will match the purpose. Amen. No things
[1:47:40] to come. There is no what? Sickness. No
[1:47:43] what? Sorrow. No what? No what? Peril.
[1:47:47] No. Nothing can do what? Separate us
[1:47:50] from the purpose of what? Delivering
[1:47:52] God.
[1:47:55] In other word, you will never get out of
[1:47:57] line.
[1:48:01] Yes sir. Amen. Amen. Because some
[1:48:05] sickness actually push us in line.
[1:48:08] [Applause]
[1:48:15] He says, "Amen. There is nothing that
[1:48:18] can separate." Let Let's read it again.
[1:48:20] There is no what? Sickness. There is no
[1:48:23] water. Sorrow. There is no what? There
[1:48:25] is no water. No. Nothing can do what?
[1:48:28] Separate us from push the break. If a
[1:48:31] sickness cannot separate you and then
[1:48:34] you fell sick.
[1:48:37] What does he mean? It mean that sickness
[1:48:40] is in the purpose. Amen.
[1:48:44] If there is a sickness that can move you
[1:48:47] from the purpose, it will never reach
[1:48:49] you. Amen. Only the sickness that work
[1:48:52] with the purpose will reach you. Amen.
[1:48:55] Only
[1:48:57] church. I'm trying to build you up. I
[1:49:02] don't know if you getting me. In other
[1:49:04] word, no trial can come unless he work
[1:49:07] for your purpose.
[1:49:09] [Applause]
[1:49:12] If a trial is coming your way, it is
[1:49:15] already been measured,
[1:49:17] calibrated,
[1:49:18] [Applause]
[1:49:20] for your purpose.
[1:49:23] [Applause]
[1:49:25] [Music]
[1:49:27] We gave the devil too much power in this
[1:49:30] message.
[1:49:34] [Music]
[1:49:36] In other words, your sickness keep you
[1:49:38] in the purpose. The more trial you
[1:49:41] going, it really stabilize you in the
[1:49:44] purpose.
[1:49:46] [Applause]
[1:49:50] There is something about German cars,
[1:49:53] BMW and Mercedes. Those that have it
[1:49:56] know what I'm talking about. The more
[1:49:58] you increasing the speed, the more the
[1:50:01] BMW goes down.
[1:50:04] That's why you don't see BMW flipping.
[1:50:08] You don't see Mercedes flipping. The
[1:50:10] more they flying, the more they going
[1:50:12] down.
[1:50:14] The more the trial, the more I'm
[1:50:16] stabilized.
[1:50:18] [Applause]
[1:50:23] In other words, the trial make me
[1:50:25] stronger. He develop my picture.
[1:50:30] [Music]
[1:50:34] Are we together?
[1:50:36] Are we together? Brother Robert, is the
[1:50:39] temperature good?
[1:50:41] Glory to God. He says no death, no what?
[1:50:45] Peril. Let me stop here. He says no
[1:50:49] sorrow, no water. Yes.
[1:50:51] So if death happened to you,
[1:50:57] that death is in the purpose. Amen. You
[1:51:00] didn't get me. That death is in the
[1:51:03] purpose. Lazarus.
[1:51:05] [Applause]
[1:51:07] The death of Lazarus for a purpose.
[1:51:11] [Applause]
[1:51:15] I'm trying to stay away from Hezekiah. I
[1:51:18] will touch Hezekiah next week. I will
[1:51:21] touch Hezekiah next week.
[1:51:24] I will touch Hezekiah next week because
[1:51:27] Hezekiah was put in the hospital bed to
[1:51:30] fix his life
[1:51:32] so that he can go. Don't worry.
[1:51:36] But the pressure, the pressure keep 15
[1:51:41] years which was an error.
[1:51:44] Wait next Sunday. Leave him. Wait next
[1:51:47] Sunday.
[1:51:50] Wait next Sunday. I will deal with Paul
[1:51:52] and Ezekiah next Sunday. Let's leave it.
[1:51:56] Let's come back here, my friend.
[1:51:57] Hallelujah. He said nothing can do what?
[1:52:01] Separate from the purpose of what? The
[1:52:03] living God. Not your purpose. The
[1:52:05] purpose of the living God. What God has
[1:52:08] what imagined in his mind. What God has
[1:52:12] what purpose in his heart to bring it to
[1:52:15] do what? Pass. There is what? No demon.
[1:52:18] There is what? No power. There is no
[1:52:20] what? Nothing can ever separate God
[1:52:24] great immortal.
[1:52:26] It must be as God said. Amen.
[1:52:34] [Applause]
[1:52:37] Everything you calling headache,
[1:52:39] heartache right now that make you cry is
[1:52:42] for a purpose.
[1:52:47] Are we together? Are we together? That's
[1:52:50] why we went to this. Now we have start
[1:52:53] our sermon.
[1:52:56] I'm starting my sermon now.
[1:53:02] If you fool, you tell me. I'm starting
[1:53:06] my sermon right now. You ready? You
[1:53:09] ready now? Brother Tony, can we come?
[1:53:12] Okay. Brother Brham says in the God who
[1:53:15] is rich in mercy. I read this so many
[1:53:18] times. But please be careful because
[1:53:20] we're going to change gears. Brother
[1:53:22] Brham say I ask him for what? Something.
[1:53:26] Sometime he shake his head and say what?
[1:53:29] No, I just rejoice so much about it as I
[1:53:34] can if he would have said yes. Now you
[1:53:37] begin to understand this. Why? Because
[1:53:39] there is a purpose. Because there is a
[1:53:42] time. Because there is a season. Brother
[1:53:44] Brham say because we always ought to ask
[1:53:48] what? Thy will be done.
[1:53:51] [Music]
[1:53:52] What brother Brham is quoting it's the
[1:53:55] prayer of Jesus.
[1:53:57] Follow me my friend. Brother Brandham is
[1:54:00] quoting the prayer of Jesus.
[1:54:04] The prayer of Jesus.
[1:54:08] Our father who are in heaven. Hallowed
[1:54:10] be thy name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will
[1:54:15] be done. But his will is his purpose. In
[1:54:19] other words, you're telling God, your
[1:54:21] purpose be done.
[1:54:26] Your purpose be done, it be done on
[1:54:29] earth as it is. So what you purpose over
[1:54:34] there must be done here.
[1:54:37] In other words, Jesus, keep me in my
[1:54:39] purpose.
[1:54:41] [Applause]
[1:54:45] Can I continue? Brother say, because we
[1:54:49] ought to ask, there will be water. His
[1:54:53] nose
[1:54:54] If that is what will. So if the knows of
[1:54:59] God is the will of God and the will of
[1:55:03] God is the purpose of God. In other
[1:55:05] words, they know is because of a
[1:55:07] purpose. I don't know if you
[1:55:09] understanding it.
[1:55:13] No, is because it's his will. Which is
[1:55:17] his purpose. Amen.
[1:55:22] No.
[1:55:24] Follow me my friend. If it it is a whole
[1:55:27] lot of better than the what? Yeses. If
[1:55:30] it's his will to do it, that is when you
[1:55:34] really do what? Love him. Amen.
[1:55:38] Not when he say yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. But
[1:55:41] when he say no, you say father I love
[1:55:45] you so much because I know your no is
[1:55:48] better
[1:55:50] because there is a purpose. Amen.
[1:55:56] You ready? You ready, my friend? You
[1:55:58] ready? I'm going to rock this thing
[1:56:00] differently. In other word, there will
[1:56:03] be prayer in your life that matches
[1:56:07] God's will.
[1:56:10] And there will be prayer in your life
[1:56:12] that will not match God's will.
[1:56:19] Amen. Amen.
[1:56:21] Amen.
[1:56:24] Where is he at? Let me start it again.
[1:56:28] There will be three things with your
[1:56:30] prayer. Let me put four things.
[1:56:35] Maybe five.
[1:56:38] Can I continue? Number one, you will
[1:56:41] have prayer in your life that everything
[1:56:45] matches God's will.
[1:56:48] Number one.
[1:56:51] All of them will be answered.
[1:56:55] We clear you will have prayer that
[1:56:58] doesn't match God's will.
[1:57:02] All of them will be answered.
[1:57:07] We say no.
[1:57:11] This one we say yes.
[1:57:16] That's right. Are we together?
[1:57:18] Are we together? The third category
[1:57:22] where I'm going to stop. You will have
[1:57:24] prayer that have a mixing.
[1:57:30] In other words, inside your prayer, some
[1:57:33] prayer are matching, some are not
[1:57:36] matching.
[1:57:37] [Music]
[1:57:39] Message believer need to learn stuff. A
[1:57:42] mixing prayer that match and some do not
[1:57:46] match.
[1:57:49] Are we together? Those that are matching
[1:57:52] will receive. Yes.
[1:57:57] Amen. Those that are not matching will
[1:58:00] receive.
[1:58:02] That's why when you pray for five
[1:58:04] things, five things, you will see three.
[1:58:08] You receive the answer. But it looks
[1:58:11] like I mean uh two other are not
[1:58:14] working. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. All of
[1:58:18] them has been answered. Amen. The three
[1:58:22] matches the time. The season and the
[1:58:26] purpose. Amen. The other one, it's not
[1:58:28] time yet. Amen. Amen. Amen. It is not
[1:58:32] the season yet. It is not the purpose
[1:58:35] yet.
[1:58:36] You already spoken with. You can swallow
[1:58:39] this. Open Matthew 8.
[1:58:42] Please, let's do good. So, I I'm reach
[1:58:44] where I'm going. I just started the
[1:58:46] sermon. Amen. Let's go to Matthew 8. If
[1:58:50] you dare, you can say amen. Amen.
[1:58:54] Matthew chapter 8. But Robert, you see
[1:58:56] why I told you I need I wish I hope I
[1:58:58] have time. You there? Matthew chapter 8.
[1:59:02] Please get your Bible. Matthew chapter
[1:59:05] 8. These things you need to have it.
[1:59:08] Yes, sir. Matthew chapter 8 verse one.
[1:59:10] If you there, you can say amen. Amen.
[1:59:13] The Bible says, "When he come down from
[1:59:16] the mountain, great multitude follow
[1:59:19] him, and behold there came a leper." And
[1:59:24] did what? Wash the food, saying,
[1:59:28] "Lord, watch his prayer. If you will,"
[1:59:34] ah, now spoken word, you learning
[1:59:36] something. He didn't say, "Lord, heal
[1:59:39] me.
[1:59:42] [Music]
[1:59:44] He said, "Lord, if you will," in other
[1:59:47] words, if it's your purpose,
[1:59:50] [Applause]
[1:59:50] [Music]
[1:59:53] because we ought to ask thy will.
[1:59:57] I hope we are together. If you get
[1:59:59] tired, I stop because this material, we
[2:00:01] can't play with it. He said, "Lord, if
[2:00:05] thy will, if you will, you can make me
[2:00:09] what?" Queen. This man never came and
[2:00:12] say Lord heal me.
[2:00:16] Is my Bible different than your Bible?
[2:00:19] He came he say Lord if you will. Not if
[2:00:23] I will. Me I want to be will. That's the
[2:00:26] reason why I'm coming. But I want to
[2:00:29] make sure what I'm desiring is also
[2:00:33] matching your will.
[2:00:37] I love this boy.
[2:00:41] I saw that he looks good.
[2:00:45] He matches Mr.
[2:00:47] He have all the sixpack.
[2:00:53] He's on fashion with all the build and
[2:00:55] everything.
[2:00:57] He has some uh uh body work that have
[2:01:01] been built up with all the stuff. Now my
[2:01:04] question is, is this your will?
[2:01:10] [Applause]
[2:01:11] Are we together? Instead of saying Lord
[2:01:14] make me marry this
[2:01:16] boy. Is this your will?
[2:01:20] Is this your purpose for my life?
[2:01:26] Is this my husband purpose?
[2:01:32] Because if it's your purpose, nothing
[2:01:35] will separate you.
[2:01:39] [Applause]
[2:01:43] Believer claim to get revelation and
[2:01:46] later on they got trouble in the
[2:01:48] marriage and they don't want to stay
[2:01:50] together. I thought you told me you got
[2:01:53] a revelation.
[2:01:56] [Music]
[2:01:57] So what is your revelation? Revelation
[2:02:00] is important to make you stand in the
[2:02:03] hard time.
[2:02:06] Hallelujah.
[2:02:08] Hallelujah.
[2:02:10] And we shall preach marriage and
[2:02:12] divorce.
[2:02:13] Are we together? Are we together?
[2:02:16] Revelation will make you stick.
[2:02:20] Instead of running away from the
[2:02:22] situation, revelation will change you.
[2:02:26] You say, "Hey, that is my husband.
[2:02:30] [Applause]
[2:02:35] You woman at work, you think you got my
[2:02:38] husband, you hit the wrong button.
[2:02:44] I'm going to go to my maker and I will
[2:02:47] see how long your relationship will
[2:02:49] last.
[2:02:53] Instead of you being sweet, you going to
[2:02:55] be be there.
[2:02:57] Your taste to him will be there because
[2:03:00] you touch the wrong thing.
[2:03:08] And when he's coming back, he say, "Ra
[2:03:10] honey, I'm sorry." You say, "I knew it.
[2:03:13] You're not going anywhere
[2:03:16] because you are the purpose of my life.
[2:03:25] Young people, you play with J. You are
[2:03:28] playing with relationship."
[2:03:31] He's my boyfriend. We just talking.
[2:03:33] Ah, it's serious.
[2:03:38] It's serious.
[2:03:40] It's not a joke. Who you taking? My
[2:03:44] husband. I don't have to watch his cell
[2:03:46] phone. Let him go.
[2:03:52] Even if he delete whatever he delete,
[2:03:55] the maker will remind me and say, "Your
[2:03:58] husband deleted something.
[2:04:05] [Music]
[2:04:06] Are we together? Are we together? Are we
[2:04:10] together? I don't know who is that for.
[2:04:13] Let me continue my stuff. This guy came.
[2:04:17] He said, "Lord Jesus, if it's your will,
[2:04:21] do what? Make me clean." Watch verse
[2:04:24] three. And Jesus put forth his hand and
[2:04:28] did what? Touched him. saying what I
[2:04:32] will. In other words, his will matches
[2:04:34] with Jesus.
[2:04:37] Church church, please stay in tune now.
[2:04:41] He says, I will be thy what? Clean. And
[2:04:44] what happened? And immediately his
[2:04:47] leprosy was what? So his request, his
[2:04:51] prayer matches Jesus prayer immediately.
[2:04:56] Amen. Yes sir. Yes sir. Any question? No
[2:05:01] sir. Any question? No sir. No sir. So
[2:05:04] sometime our prayer Amen will match his
[2:05:09] purpose. And what happened?
[2:05:12] Now let's change category.
[2:05:15] Please stay in tune.

[2:06:59] Peter and say to him behold he's talking
[2:07:03] to Jesus we have forsaken all and did

[2:08:03] In this generation no in the generation
[2:08:06] to come they have 12 there. The only one
[2:08:11] who didn't have it is Judah who was
[2:08:13] replaced by Paul
[2:08:17] because Judah was a son of predition. So
[2:08:20] according to this verse here every
[2:08:22] apostle have a throne sir Jesus Christ
[2:08:26] have his throne sir the apostle have
[2:08:28] their throne. That's why we got a throne
[2:08:31] in heaven and 24.
[2:08:39] Have I lost you? We got a throne in
[2:08:43] heaven.
[2:08:45] Oh, glory to God. We got a throne in the
[2:08:49] heaven. The throne of Christ. Amen. Then
[2:08:53] we got 12 here and 12 over there. But we
[2:08:58] already seen the 12 are the apostle.
[2:09:02] And brother already told us the other 12
[2:09:05] are the patriarch.
[2:09:07] Amen. But we are dealing with the
[2:09:09] apostle.
[2:09:11] Are we together? So according to Jesus
[2:09:14] Christ, every apostle have already a
[2:09:18] predestinated
[2:09:20] follow me my friend position in heaven
[2:09:24] before the foundation of the world and
[2:09:28] John come on brother and James
[2:09:32] being apostle already have two thrones.
[2:09:38] I hope you are following me. So if you
[2:09:40] have 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12. So
[2:09:51] maybe somewhere here we got John. So he
[2:09:54] want to sit with his brother James.
[2:09:58] Any problem? I don't have a quote. I
[2:10:01] just pick it up. Any problem? Are we
[2:10:03] together? Yes, sir. So John position
[2:10:07] secure before the foundation of the
[2:10:09] world. James position secure before the
[2:10:13] foundation of the world. Are we
[2:10:15] together? In other word you cannot claim
[2:10:18] his position.
[2:10:20] Follow me. Follow me.
[2:10:23] Because this position have a name. If
[2:10:26] you get there when John get to heaven,
[2:10:29] John will tell you you are sitting on my
[2:10:31] spot.
[2:10:33] You are on my spot.
[2:10:37] [Applause]
[2:10:38] This spot was predestinated to me and no
[2:10:42] one can take my position and James
[2:10:44] already have it. Are you following me?
[2:10:48] And not only James and John, but all 12
[2:10:52] apostle receive the same thing. Follow
[2:10:56] me. The same thing, the same throne
[2:11:00] judging Israel. So the throne of John is
[2:11:04] now greater than the throne of James.
[2:11:08] Are you following me? The throne of
[2:11:10] James is now greater than the throne of
[2:11:13] Peter. The throne of Peter is now
[2:11:15] greater than the throne of Barell. All
[2:11:18] of them 12 throne. So when they get to
[2:11:21] heaven in line, Peter say h this is me
[2:11:25] but you over there. And everybody sit
[2:11:28] and they say, "How was your day today?"
[2:11:32] And this one say, "Hey, Peter, you
[2:11:34] okay?" And John say, "Oh, I'm all
[2:11:36] right." And then let's listen to the go
[2:11:39] to to the Lord Jesus Christ, the master.
[2:11:41] So, Father, what do you want us to do?
[2:11:43] Everybody's sitting in their throne.
[2:11:45] Everybody in the same position. No one
[2:11:48] is greater than another.
[2:11:50] Everybody's the same throne.
[2:11:53] Everybody in this church is sitting on
[2:11:55] the same tree.
[2:11:59] [Applause]
[2:12:01] So, brother Angelo, can I tell brother
[2:12:04] Tony, my chair is better than yours?
[2:12:07] Brother Tony say you wasting your time.
[2:12:09] Look at the color. Are you blind?
[2:12:14] Are we together? Are we together? We
[2:12:17] clear now. But we dealing with John and
[2:12:20] James. We want to see our prayer toward
[2:12:23] Jesus Christ.
[2:12:24] Come on, brother. Let's go to John 20.
[2:12:27] Uhhuh. Please help me now. Let's go to

[2:12:33] Matthew 19. Now, Matthew 20. We start on
[2:12:36] Matthew 10, Matthew 19, now Matthew 20.
[2:12:41] So, in other word, what happened in
[2:12:43] Matthew 20 is after Jesus already
[2:12:47] revealed to everybody that they got a
[2:12:50] throne. Amen. We clear at the beginning
[2:12:53] they didn't know. Now Jesus unfolded
[2:12:56] their position before the foundation of
[2:12:57] the world. Now watch 20.
[2:13:01] You there my friend? Verse 17. If you

[2:13:09] how many disciple? 12. We clear enough?
[2:13:13] We we are we clear? He took how many
[2:13:15] disciple? 12. So everybody was there.
[2:13:18] All the 12 were walking with Jesus
[2:13:20] Christ. If you ask all the 12, what is
[2:13:23] your new revelation now? My brother, I
[2:13:25] got a place in heaven. Uhhuh. You will
[2:13:28] be over there. But we will be in in the
[2:13:32] concert. We will be sitting with the

[2:18:54] [Applause]
[2:18:55] In other word, Mama Zebedee is saying,
[2:18:58] "Get this, put one here, and take this
[2:19:01] and put one there."
[2:19:05] Mama Zed,
[2:19:08] we have so many. Mama Zebedee,
[2:19:13] I want my boy to be a preacher. Mama,
[2:19:17] [Applause]
[2:19:21] before you know it, your boy will

[2:19:57] you ask."
[2:20:02] The leper, his will match Jesus will.
[2:20:07] But mama Zebedee, her will is different
[2:20:11] than Jesus will. Jesus look he said mama
[2:20:15] I know you love your children but you
[2:20:17] don't even know what you're asking

[2:20:36] say you know not what you ask
[2:20:39] are you able
[2:20:41] to drink of a cup that I shall drink and
[2:20:46] be baptized of the baptism that I'm
[2:20:49] baptized with.
[2:20:52] In other words, to sit on the throne.
[2:20:57] Yes. To have a
[2:21:01] reservation, brother in heaven, in the
[2:21:04] merit banquet to reserve your seat.
[2:21:09] Brother Kenny, you need to think.
[2:21:12] You need to be baptized with the same
[2:21:15] baptism that Jesus was baptized.
[2:21:20] [Music]
[2:21:20] [Applause]
[2:21:22] And you also need to have some suffering
[2:21:26] just like Jesus want to suffer.
[2:21:31] So to go to heaven, Holy Ghost and
[2:21:33] suffering.
[2:21:35] But suffering is for your development.
[2:21:37] [Applause]
[2:21:42] My friend, when I preach things like
[2:21:44] this, the high blood pressure should
[2:21:47] begin to go.
[2:21:49] I don't want to see a young child here.
[2:21:52] I have
[2:21:54] anxiety. Instead of me praying, I will
[2:21:56] begin to get upset because I'm already
[2:21:59] working on it right now.
[2:22:01] I don't want to see a young sisters
[2:22:03] here.
[2:22:06] I don't have no husband. Hey,
[2:22:13] you got a husband. It's a matter of
[2:22:15] time, season, and purpose.
[2:22:23] Are we together? So when I see all of
[2:22:26] you smiling,
[2:22:28] come on. I don't want people front faces
[2:22:32] like this. Hey, we going to heaven.
[2:22:36] Amen.
[2:22:38] Can I continue? And so let me go back to
[2:22:41] where I was. So to reserve your ticket,
[2:22:45] right? To reserve your ticket in heaven,
[2:22:48] you need two conditions. Number one, you
[2:22:51] must be baptized and you must drink the
[2:22:53] cup of suffering.
[2:22:56] And Jesus is asking Mama Zebedee. Mama
[2:22:59] Zed, you don't even know what you're
[2:23:00] asking. What you're asking goes with
[2:23:03] pricing. And the price is follow me my
[2:23:06] friend because I'm going to drop
[2:23:08] something. The price is you must drink
[2:23:11] the cup
[2:23:13] the cup of suffering
[2:23:15] and also you must be baptized with the
[2:23:18] same baptism Jesus was baptized which is
[2:23:22] the baptism of the Holy Ghost.
[2:23:26] Amen.
[2:23:27] Amen. Amen.
[2:23:30] Amen. Amen. Let me move ahead and I come
[2:23:33] back. Was all apostle being baptized
[2:23:36] with the Holy Ghost? No sir.
[2:23:40] All of them. Remove Judah. Exactly.
[2:23:44] They were baptized. All of them in the
[2:23:46] upper room. They got the Holy Ghost.
[2:23:50] Follow me. Follow me. And uh verse 22,
[2:23:55] but Jesus answer and say, you know not
[2:23:57] what you ask. Are you able to drink the
[2:23:59] cup that I shall drink and to be
[2:24:01] baptized with the baptism I'm baptized
[2:24:03] with?
[2:24:04] They mama zebed they mama zebed and her
[2:24:09] two children they it's plural mama zebed
[2:24:14] uh John and James all of them because
[2:24:18] they were in one accord
[2:24:22] asking one thing father you say in your
[2:24:25] word when we come together in one
[2:24:29] accord can I continue and they Say to
[2:24:33] him, "What?"
[2:24:35] In other words, we going to do it. In
[2:24:37] other words, we going to do it. So, you
[2:24:39] must grant unto us the two position.
[2:24:42] Watch Jesus. Watch Jesus. Verse 23. And
[2:24:46] he said to them, you shall drink indeed.
[2:24:51] Amen. In other words, John and James,
[2:24:54] you will suffer. Go search the
[2:24:56] scripture. You will find John the Revel
[2:24:58] was persecuted and James was persecuted.
[2:25:02] Do you follow me? He said, John and
[2:25:04] James, you will be you will drink indeed
[2:25:06] the cup and be baptized
[2:25:09] with what? The baptism that I am what?
[2:25:13] Baptized with. In other words, Jesus
[2:25:15] said, even though you are able
[2:25:18] to meet the criteria,
[2:25:21] I will baptize you with the Holy Ghost.
[2:25:24] You won't suffer for my name. But when
[2:25:28] he come to the position,
[2:25:32] [Applause]
[2:25:35] spoken word. When we come to the
[2:25:38] position,
[2:25:39] your request doesn't match.
[2:25:44] Your request is not matching my purpose.
[2:25:50] [Applause]
[2:25:55] Brother Chris, brother Lemon, let's
[2:25:58] stick together and pray. Oh father you
[2:26:00] say when two or three are gathering
[2:26:02] remember
[2:26:04] your prayer will be answered if it
[2:26:07] matches the purpose
[2:26:11] spoken word I believe are you
[2:26:14] understanding
[2:26:17] so no more headache
[2:26:21] the Bible says but where are we at 23
[2:26:25] but to sit where
[2:26:28] on my hand and on my what? It is not
[2:26:32] mine
[2:26:35] but it shall be what?
[2:26:38] To them
[2:26:40] for whom it is what? Prepared of
[2:26:43] prepared of what? My father. So God
[2:26:48] had Moses.
[2:26:50] Yes sir. Yes sir. Yes sir. Yes sir.
[2:26:57] And Elijah.
[2:27:00] already there.
[2:27:03] I know where I'm coming from. I already
[2:27:06] went through this. Now, mama
[2:27:10] want to move John and James to go over
[2:27:14] here. Jesus say ah baptism I give it to
[2:27:17] you.
[2:27:19] Suffering I give it to you. But the
[2:27:21] position is against my will. It's
[2:27:24] against my purpose. In other words, I
[2:27:27] have to move someone. I have to reshift
[2:27:30] order. Sometime your prayer doesn't
[2:27:33] match his will.
[2:27:37] [Applause]
[2:27:40] Brother Michael, are we together? Your
[2:27:43] prayer is not matching his will. Are we
[2:27:46] together? So, what should be the answer?
[2:27:50] No. His nose are better than his yes
[2:27:56] because you already got thrown.
[2:27:59] Hallelujah.
[2:28:02] [Applause]
[2:28:04] Ask Jesus to sit at the right hand. He
[2:28:06] refused. Jesus told you you got a
[2:28:08] throne.
[2:28:12] Now watch where I'm going to strike
[2:28:14] hard. Amen. We there. Verse 24. You
[2:28:18] there? Amen. And when the who the 10
[2:28:21] heard it follow me 12 disciple minus two
[2:28:25] sons of mama
[2:28:27] he give you what? 10. Now the 10 heard
[2:28:30] it.
[2:28:32] Let's push the break. Follow me. Spoken
[2:28:35] word. Follow me. Did Jesus give them the
[2:28:38] position?
[2:28:40] Jesus didn't give them the position
[2:28:42] because Jesus already gave the position
[2:28:44] that all apostle have. Watch what
[2:28:47] happened now. When the 10 heard,
[2:28:50] they were what? Moved with indignation.
[2:28:54] Moved with what? Indignation against
[2:28:57] what? The true brethren. Come on. Come
[2:29:00] on.
[2:29:03] Come on, brother.
[2:29:05] Do you see the problem in this message?
[2:29:09] Did Jesus give the two brother the
[2:29:11] position?
[2:29:12] Did Jesus change their position? I mean
[2:29:15] in regard to the other apostle. So what
[2:29:18] was the jealousy about?
[2:29:23] Now they got upset. They got upset like
[2:29:27] Jesus gave them. Jesus didn't give them
[2:29:31] the suffering. All apostles suffer.
[2:29:34] The baptism. All of them were in the
[2:29:36] upper room. They received the same
[2:29:38] baptism. What are you envying your
[2:29:40] brother about? In other words, when your
[2:29:44] brother have a certain type of faith
[2:29:48] different than you, leave him alone.
[2:29:53] Yes, sir.
[2:29:59] [Applause]
[2:30:01] Who forbid you to go ask Jesus?
[2:30:04] Everybody have a right to go ask Jesus.
[2:30:07] You are sitting there doing nothing.
[2:30:09] Somebody got courage enough to go do it.
[2:30:12] Now it's your problem.
[2:30:16] You already have all the same throne,
[2:30:19] but you have different faith.
[2:30:22] You all are singers, but you got
[2:30:25] different voices.
[2:30:28] If somebody want to sing more, don't get
[2:30:31] jealous. Leave them alone.

[2:31:38] them received the same baptism. At the
[2:31:40] end of the day, when they went to
[2:31:41] heaven, all of them sat on the same
[2:31:43] throne. Why were you jealous about your

[2:35:23] friend. Are we together?
[2:35:29] Are we together? Are we together? I

[2:35:52] now to the airport. So I'm I'm climbing
[2:35:54] down. Okay. Okay,
[2:35:58] friend. Okay. Ah. Okay. So as a
[2:36:04] conclusion
[2:36:08] sometime your prayer matches
[2:36:11] Lord if it's thy will
[2:36:14] make me whole I will get it glory to God
[2:36:19] I pray it happen and we create problem
[2:36:22] in the message
[2:36:25] sir we begin to get the gift of healing
[2:36:28] and to put it on certain ministry that's
[2:36:31] right that's And the minister become
[2:36:33] like they the one healing the people.
[2:36:38] No, you will see even those that have
[2:36:40] multiple miracle. Some of them don't
[2:36:42] happen.
[2:36:44] They pray for 100 people. 10 are healed
[2:36:48] and 80 are not healed because it's not
[2:36:50] the minister.
[2:36:52] It is the time, the purpose and the
[2:36:55] season.
[2:36:57] I don't care how much that minister
[2:36:58] pushes
[2:37:00] you on the floor. You rise up there,
[2:37:03] nothing happen. And he frustrates you
[2:37:05] more.
[2:37:09] So and so when he pray for you, things
[2:37:10] happen. Everybody pray a line.
[2:37:14] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Boom. On the
[2:37:16] floor. You walk up, things don't change.
[2:37:19] Now you frustrated. I went to so and so,
[2:37:21] he pray, nothing happened. I went to so
[2:37:23] and so, he prayed, nothing to happen.
[2:37:25] I'm I'm discouraged. I'm not I need to
[2:37:27] leave the message. Let me watch some
[2:37:29] Pentecostal preacher because you don't
[2:37:31] know this message. You don't know the
[2:37:34] time. You don't know the season. You
[2:37:36] don't know the purpose. If it's the
[2:37:39] time, the season, and the purpose, even
[2:37:43] your own husband will pray for you and
[2:37:45] the devil will leave.
[2:37:50] Amen.
[2:37:53] Are we together? Are we together?
[2:37:56] Sometime we come with prayer and when we
[2:38:00] come with prayer in our prayer we got
[2:38:03] things that are mixed like mama zebed
[2:38:08] mama zebed came with a request but the
[2:38:10] request is contrary to God's original
[2:38:13] plan because God purpose he cannot
[2:38:16] change it. He already gave it to
[2:38:18] somebody else. It's for those who have
[2:38:20] been given. But the request about the
[2:38:22] Holy Ghost, Jesus said get that one.
[2:38:25] About the suffering, get that one.
[2:38:27] That's a universal one. You can get that
[2:38:29] one. But as far as the position, no.
[2:38:31] That's why when you pray, some prayer
[2:38:34] works and some are not praying. It's not
[2:38:36] going because it's not the season or
[2:38:40] because it's not the time or because
[2:38:42] it's not the purpose. But God answered
[2:38:45] the prayer by saying no. and his nose is
[2:38:49] better than the yes because what God
[2:38:52] give you is the best for you.
[2:38:57] Amen. Don't envy somebody's husband. The
[2:39:00] one God gave you is the best. That one
[2:39:03] need to match with sister so and so, not
[2:39:06] you.
[2:39:08] [Applause]
[2:39:11] Because sister so and so was built for
[2:39:13] brother so and so. You are not built for
[2:39:15] him.
[2:39:21] Are we together? Are we together? So
[2:39:24] when we pray,
[2:39:27] we pray and we say according to thy
[2:39:30] will.
[2:39:33] I'm going to stop right here.
[2:39:35] According to thy will. You pray, you say
[2:39:39] according to thy will. Because if it's
[2:39:42] his will, you're going to get it. If
[2:39:45] it's his will but it's not the time,
[2:39:47] you're going to get it later.
[2:39:53] If it's his will but it's not the
[2:39:54] decision. You're going to get it later.
[2:39:56] Jesus already said yes. But it's not
[2:39:59] going to happen at that time. It will
[2:40:01] happen 15 years. It will happen after 3
[2:40:05] years. It will happen when you are gone.
[2:40:11] Amen. Amen. You are there in the
[2:40:13] banister of glory, but your prayer has
[2:40:16] been answered because God always answers
[2:40:20] prayer. Let's stop here, my friend. We
[2:40:22] will pick up next time.
[2:40:25] [Applause]
[2:40:32] Hey, hey, hey, hey.
[2:40:35] Sorry, brother Robert.
[2:40:38] I look at this slide. that say 1 2 3
[2:40:41] boom we
[2:40:43] done we stop right
[2:40:46] here we stop right here so we had to go
[2:40:50] on the back
[2:40:51] here that's why I say we go to another
[2:40:54] hour let's push it what you got is
[2:40:57] already sufficient to go through
[2:40:59] throughout the week amen amen
[2:41:04] when you pray just know God answers
[2:41:08] prayer
[2:41:13] and have faith that God heard me
[2:41:16] because God always hears your prayer
[2:41:20] and remove anxiety and stay calm. It's
[2:41:23] going to come. Don't look at the
[2:41:25] pressure of who's getting something
[2:41:27] quicker than you. We are not in
[2:41:28] competition.
[2:41:30] Everybody have their own timing, their
[2:41:32] own purpose, and their own season.
[2:41:35] the apostle a throne
[2:41:38] the Moses and Elijah a throne if you
[2:41:41] notice brother Brham when he went to the
[2:41:43] sixth dimension he was on the throne
[2:41:47] but it was not the 24 elders it's
[2:41:50] another one and matter of fact in the
[2:41:52] book of revelation chapter 3 to him that
[2:41:55] overcometh
[2:41:59] I will make him sit where with me in
[2:42:02] which throne
[2:42:05] So, how should I envy the apostle
[2:42:07] throne?
[2:42:09] When I'm going to sit in his throne, why
[2:42:12] should I envy the apostle throne?
[2:42:17] You ask, you don't know what you're
[2:42:19] asking.
[2:42:20] And I'm going to show you because we
[2:42:22] don't know what we asking. What does God
[2:42:25] do to help us asking the right thing?
[2:42:28] That's where I was trying to go. Let's
[2:42:30] keep it for Sunday. Heavenly Father,
[2:42:32] Lord, we are approaching you humbly this
[2:42:35] afternoon. Father, we thank you for your
[2:42:37] grace, for your love and your mercy and
[2:42:40] for everything you have been doing for
[2:42:42] us. Father, this is as far as you wanted
[2:42:45] me to go to help your children here and
[2:42:48] worldwide. Father, I commit everything
[2:42:51] that was spoken unto hand. Lord, may the
[2:42:53] Holy Spirit take this and go deeper than
[2:42:56] what was spoken so that Lord the child,
[2:42:59] your children, their life can be
[2:43:01] delivered completely. And this should
[2:43:04] build faith in our life and confidence
[2:43:06] and peace knowing Lord Father that when
[2:43:10] we come to you, it's not a myth. It not
[2:43:13] a joke. This is serious. You are hearing
[2:43:16] our prayer. You are hearing and you are
[2:43:18] answering our prayer. And now we
[2:43:20] understand the element of time, the
[2:43:23] element of season, and the element of
[2:43:25] purpose. And we thank you because
[2:43:28] regardless of how we feel, you don't
[2:43:30] deviate from your purpose. Father, you
[2:43:32] didn't compromise with Mama Zebedee to
[2:43:35] change your program because Lord,
[2:43:38] Father, you already predestinated and
[2:43:40] you kept your program separate only the
[2:43:43] way you said it. Father, if you would
[2:43:45] have followed our desire, how many time
[2:43:48] would you have changed your program, you
[2:43:50] will be changing your program every
[2:43:52] second because this one want this, this
[2:43:54] one want this. But father, your word is
[2:43:57] eternal. You purposed for one time. You
[2:44:00] did it for eternity and you took the
[2:44:02] best for us. And the plan that you have
[2:44:05] for our life, our plan of peace to give
[2:44:07] us an expected end. And because of that,
[2:44:10] Lord, we know that our position are
[2:44:12] secure. No matter who's going to pray
[2:44:15] where in the message, no one will take
[2:44:17] our place and we will not take somebody
[2:44:19] else place. Our place has been ordained
[2:44:22] and we are guaranteed to meet you on the
[2:44:25] other side. Father, we thank you and
[2:44:27] commit everything. May you take the
[2:44:29] remaining of the week. May you take the
[2:44:31] service, Lord, Father, the funeral
[2:44:33] service tomorrow onto the hand. May you
[2:44:35] continue to strengthen the family and
[2:44:37] bless all of us, Father, in Jesus
[2:44:40] precious name. Amen. Amen. God bless
[2:44:43] you. We love you.
[2:44:45] [Applause]
[2:44:51] I have believed it and he is
[2:44:59] able to keep that which I
[2:45:04] committed unto him again that day.
[2:45:11] But I
[2:45:12] know I have
[2:45:15] believed and I was
[2:45:18] waiting that
[2:45:21] he
[2:45:24] [Music]
[2:45:34] to not why God wants grace to
[2:45:41] He had
[2:45:44] me. No, I
[2:45:48] unworthy. Christy love me before him.
[2:45:57] I
[2:45:58] know I
[2:46:01] believe and
[2:46:03] persuade that he is
[2:46:07] able to keep that
[2:46:12] time. Y'all can be dismissed. God bless
[2:46:15] you. Enjoy your afternoon.
[2:46:19] I know not how saving faith to
[2:46:27] [Music]
[2:46:29] me nor
[2:46:33] howing in his word brought peace within
[2:46:39] my heart.
[2:46:42] I
[2:46:43] know I
[2:46:46] [Music]
[2:46:53] believe
[2:46:55] he will
[2:46:57] be unto you again that day.
[2:47:04] I
[2:47:05] know how the spirit
[2:47:11] moves in. I
[2:47:13] [Music]
[2:47:14] see
[2:47:16] revealing Jesus through his
[2:47:22] wording faith in me.
[2:47:26] I
[2:47:28] know. I
[2:47:31] believe that I'm pers.
[2:47:33] way that he is
[2:47:40] able to
[2:47:42] be unto him again.
[2:47:49] I know the one of good or
[2:47:55] maybe
[2:47:59] [Music]
[2:48:01] deser
[2:48:04] [Music]
[2:48:05] way for his face I
[2:48:10] see. I know who I am.
[2:48:16] I
[2:48:18] am
[2:48:22] [Music]
[2:48:26] heaven
[2:48:28] but
[2:48:32] I
[2:48:35] know my
[2:48:37] [Music]
[2:48:39] heart for
[2:48:43] you glory.
[2:48:46] I
[2:48:47] wonder with him for
[2:48:53] me. But I know I
[2:48:56] know I
[2:49:00] have this
[2:49:03] [Music]
[2:49:10] way. I believe I can
[2:49:16] save. Yes, I
[2:49:18] know. I
[2:49:20] [Music]
[2:49:24] believe he is
[2:49:27] able to
[2:49:29] [Music]
[2:49:33] keep him here.
[2:49:35] [Music]
[2:49:39] Yes, I
[2:49:40] know. I
[2:49:44] [Music]
[2:49:46] believe that
[2:49:49] he
[2:49:52] keeps
[2:49:54] away
[2:49:56] until again that day.
