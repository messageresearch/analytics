possible jesus jesus [Music] jesus is here all things are possible jesus amen god bless you all we greet you all in the name of jesus christ looks like we got some empty chairs here we need people on the firing line amen i promised last sunday based on there was a a question that was sent to me and it was brother micah daily who asked me the question about the seventh angel of revelation 10 and the seventh angel of revelation 11. and i know people are attacking the message through that showing that it's the same angel so i promise to do that today but our boss the lord jesus christ told me before i can teach that i need to speak on something today so if you miss something throughout one all the way to 19 this is your summary it's going to pull everything together and put it together for you so if you miss something we sleep something you're gonna get it today so be prepared stay alert shake yourself if you're sleepy and may the holy spirit speak to the church this morning yeah brother mike will even remind me something i say elijah shall come first and i omitted first i say no no elijah shall come first the key is shall we because it's projecting to the future elijah shall it's in the future but raja is already came which is the past so just want to connect that in case somebody's watching on youtube seeking for trouble second king chapter 25 i'm glad brother branham says 700 then he said no i meant 7 000. so i sent brother michael uh uh uh a quote brother branham say you take me as the dutchman take me for what i wanted to say amen i love brother micah he's always there watching backing me up it's good to her brothers like that second king chapter 25 if you dare you can say amen you really need your bible verse eight and in the fifth month on on the seventh day of the month which is the 19th year of king nebuchadnezzar king of babylon kem nabusarandan captain of the guard a servant of king of the king of babylon unto jerusalem you might be seated so the key here that we're trying to point there is that babylon came to destroy israel that's the key the key is babylon came to destroy israel verse 9 and they burn the house of the lord in other words the temple we know that when we speak when we spoke about the temple we showed the temple of solomon with 120 people then when jesus came jesus brought the transition jesus told the disciple he said destroy this temple and i'm going to build it in three days so when they heard him they say wait a minute this temple was built in 46 years brother branham said 49 the bible say 46 brother branham did not make a mistake when we gonna get on the 70 weeks of daniel you're going to see why it's 46 here and why is the prophet saying 49 so jesus pointed them that it is not this building and the bible said he was not talking about the building but he was talking about his body because according to malachi 3 the lord will come into his temple and that temple was no longer the temple of solomon but it was the temple of the lord jesus christ but on the day of pentecost we found out that the temple changed from jesus into the bread and we give you scripture after scripture to show you that you are the temple of the lord we are the house of the lord so we found out that this temple of solomon was built but babylon came and when babylon came to jerusalem not only did they destroy the city of jerusalem but they destroyed the temple so the temple that was built by solomon there was a temple by solomon that was built that temple when it was built we found out that there was 120 level there and that temple was doing its own thing worship but somehow in the middle of the road babylon came and babylon destroyed the temple there there was a temple of solomon there was a temple of jesus christ there was a temple of the brother god does not change everybody there and he burned verse 9 the house of the lord and the king's house and all the houses of jerusalem and every great man's house burn here with fire verse 10 and all the army of the caldeans that were with the captain of the guard broke down the walls of jerusalem so not only was the temple destroyed but the city was destroyed now the rest of the people that were left in the city and the fugitive that fell the way to the king of babylon with the remnant of the multitude did nabu surrender the captain of the guard carried away but the captain of the guard left of the poor of the land to be vine dressers and husband men so when this destruction happened there were people that were taken into captivity to babylon everybody clear let's go to the book of ezra if you never heard certain books being preached in the message you're going to hear everything in this church by the grace of god we're going to get in the song of solomon we get to ezra we get to habakkuk we get to all of them because by the opening of the seventh year there is no restriction to any books in the bible the entire word of god has been opened ezra chapter 3 if you dare you can say amen page is still turning ezra chapter 3 verse 1 and when the seventh month not the first month not the second not the third bada 7 we found out that at the beginning of the seventh month was the sounding of trumpet and we explained that the seven month was the seven church ages and at the beginning of it where the trumpet sounding bringing israel back to the promised land and when the seventh month was come not on the first not on the sixth on the seventh was come and the children of israel were in the cities the people gathered themselves together as one man to jerusalem so everybody left some people left babylon and they went back to jerusalem but when they went back to jerusalem they gathered together as one man in other words there was a unity it was like in the day of pentecost because in the day of pentecost they were gathered together as one man one thought one accord and we found out that when the people left babylon when they went back to the promised land they gathered together as one man getting ready for a pentecost are you there then stood up joshua i'm gonna show you in another place his name is joshua okay then stood up jeshua or joshua the son of jesus and his brethren the priest so the first man that was spoken here his name is jeshua or joshua which was speaking about jesus christ are you there there is joshua here and joshua was not alone but joshua had preached with him this and uh and his brethren the priest the second man was zerubbabel the second man is the ruba bell the bubble call him sometime zorobabel and his brethren so joshua here has priest i want you to follow me carefully but zorobel has his brethren so the robber bell was a jew but for some reason they put him assad from his brethren praise the lord and built the altar of god of israel they went back to rebuild the temple but instead of starting to rebuild the temple the first thing they rebuilt was the altar there are many altar in the temple but we want to know which one the altar of god of israel to offer burn offering so the first thing joshua and the robber bell did was to rebuild the altar and that altar was the author of the burn offering which is speaking about the brazen order if you need more clarification you see me you already got my number the number of the church officer if you have any question feel free open your cannon give us a call let's talk no hiding stuff and you are struggling if we preach something you need more clarification give us a call okay they built the altar of god of israel to offer burn off in their own the present okay as it is written in the law of moses the man of god so the bible in the old testament was the book of the lord he came in moreover with the mighty angel so jehovah did everything with joshua according to the book according to their bible of their time [Music] but the first thing was the altar everybody there job two verse six from the first day of the seventh month seven churches we are still on the seventh month began dead to offer burnt offerings to the lord but watch carefully the foundation of the temple of the lord was not yet laid so they only work with the altar but the second thing the bible is talking about is the foundation of the temple remember paul says that i later okay verse seven they gave money also to the meson and to the carpenter and meet and drink and all to them of zion and to them of tyre to bring cedar streets from lebanon just like solomon did to the sea of joppa according to the grant that the head of sarri's king of persia watch verse 8. now the second year of the coming of the house of god at jerusalem in the second month begins jeroboam the son zerubbabel the son of celtia and jeshua the son of jose deck and the remnant of the brethren the priest and the levite so there is three category of people here we have joshua we have zerubbabel and we have a remnant of people and that remnant had priest he had levite he had children of israel in another place he also has prophets and these children were not all israel it was only two tribes it was the tribe of judah and the tribe of benjamin i would deal with this when we talk about the two stave of the ark of the covenant are you there the remnant of their brethren the priest and the levite and all day that will come out of captivity to jerusalem so these people came out of captivity of babylon back to jerusalem and appointed they leave out from 20 years old and upward to set forward the work of the house of the lord job to verse 10 very important and when the builder laid the foundation of the temple of the lord the first thing they built the brazen altar according to the law or the order bible the second thing now they are building the foundation everybody there the foundation that was destroyed by babylon now zero bell and joshua are coming back before they put the foundation they started first with the brazen altar to make sure the sacrifice is continually given to god then they rebuilt the foundation of the house of the lord everybody there and when the bill delayed the foundation of the temple of the lord they set the priest in their apparel with the trumpet and they leave out the sons of azer with symbols to praise the lord after the ordinance of david king of israel and they sang together by course of praising and giving thanks to the lord because he's good for his mercy endures forever toward israel and all the people shouted with great shout so when they put the brass an altar no problem but when they laid the foundation shouting begin to start in the house of god something happened with that foundation that when the foundation came back shouting came back are you there shouting when they praised the lord there was presence shouting like the like a pentecost back are you there because the foundation of the house of the lord was laid but many of the priests and leavert and the chief of the father who were ancient men that had seen the first house when the foundation of this house was laid before the eyes they did what wept so when the foundation was placed some people were shouting for joy and other was weeping depending on what the holy spirit does to you when the holy spirit drop her imam makes somebody shout he might make somebody jump and he can make somebody also crying are you there praise the lord and for the foundation of the house was laid before the eyes wept with her loud voice they were not whipping like they were weeping like a pentecost and many did what shouted a lot for joy they were not saying praise the lord they were going out like praise the lord are you there praise the lord verse 13 so that the people could not discern the noise of the shout of joy from the noise of the whipping of the people for the people shattered with a large shout and the nose was heard and far off so when the holy spirit dropped in this place i want you to be free if you need to shout shout if you need to cry cry if you need to jump jump because the people in the hotel must heal your shout out are you there so be free in this church worship god according to the liberty of the holy gods we are not catholic we are not religious here we are free if the holy spirit make you jump jump zechariah chapter 4 if you have a trouble with that you listen to the tape of brother branham and you're going to hear noise and shouting and speaking in tongues and interpretation in the message zechariah chapter four if you dare you can say amen and the angel that talked with me verse one came again and worked me as a man that is working out of his sleep and said to me what see you he's talking about the prophet and i said i have looked and behold a candlestick of gold with a ball upon the top of it and with its seven lamps there on and seven pops to the seven lamps which are upon the top thereof so when zechariah is looking what he's seeing he's seeing a candlestick with seven lamps everybody there and there was a ball here on top from where the seven lamps were pulling oil verse three and two olive trees by it we already preached about this one upon the right side of the ball and the other on the left side of the ball so with this there were two trees here one on the right one on the left are you there verse four so i answered and spoke to the angel that talked with him with me saying what are these my lord zechariah is asking a question what does this mean then the angel that talked with me answered and said to me no you know what this be and i say no my lord then he answered and spoke to me saying this is the word of the lord to zerubbabel so when zechariah was looking at the candlestick zechariah said what does this mean instead of the angel answering him and saying it means this this the angel begin to talk to him about zerubbabel in other words the candlestick have something to do with zerubbabel this is the word of the lord to who it is a message specific to not everybody i am talking to zorobabel saying not by might nor by power but my spirit said the lord of hosts in other words the work that are gonna be done here are not gonna be done by the power of men it's gonna be done by the power of the holy ghost in other words zoro babel his first message must speak about the holy ghost holy ghost remind zoro babel that that the first thing of his message must be the holy ghost he must take the people from doing things on their own he must take the people out of the law he must bring them to the foundation of pentecost seven who are you oh great mountain before zero babel you shall become a plane so when you see a mountain standing before the rubble bell you are already doomed are you there and he shall bring forth there oh so the third thing according to zechariah so robert bell must bring the headstone headstone is also called capstone your eyes are open now are you there the ministry of zorro baba connected with joshua have three works rebuilt the altar rebuild the foundation and then bring the capstone down [Applause] are we clear now are we clear now hallelujah and have the uh verse 7 and he shall bring forth the headstone thereof with what shouting again are you there crying oh my god crying what grace grace to eat double grace a message of grace moreover the word of the lord came to me saying the hands of who jeroboam who is this rubber bell the hands hence brother bottom say it means works so the ministry of zoroable bear are you following me have led the foundation of this house so the first work of the robber that he's gonna do what lay the foundation are you there praise the lord his hand also that same ministry okay we'll do what the word use is what did you get it not yet the word use is what at the sounding of the seven ninja all the mystery will be okay the hand of the rubber band have laid the foundation of this house his hand the same ministry shall also finish it and you shall know that the lord of hosts has sent i'll go with that scent later me to you for who has this passed the day of small things so so babe when he start his ministry he's struggling i am nazarova bell but i'm just giving an example so when zoroba best started his ministry he didn't have a piano player i am not zoro babel are you there he was struggling at the beginning of his ministry when he want to preach his coat as a whole okay and people look at him and they say this is gonna be a garage here who has dispersed the day of small things for they shall rejoice and see the plummet that word plummet is also called a plum line when a mason built a house they usually have a load of thread like this that has like a stone over there are you there because when you hold the thread like this it's not going to keep a right line so they put a stone for them to measure the wall and to make sure the wall is straight so rubber bear will have that instrument the people will rejoice when the hand of the robot his hand will catch an instrument and that instrument is used to measure every wall of the temple if you are building a house you must go by the measure of zorobabel that measure struck the hand of the robber watch and shall see the plummet or the plum line in the hand of zorobabe with those so the plum line that is on zorobabel have a stone under and that stone have seven something relax continue they are the what so this stone that's the rubber ball has with a thread have seven eyes where do you get that go back to verse three chapter 3. just go back this way i don't want you to say brother stephen saying you see chapter 3 there job 2 verse 9 and for behold the stone that i have led before who joshua upon how many stones there is only one stone upon one stone shall be what so it's one stone but seven eyes seven angels one stone are you there and when you look at the stone of the planet here you usually have a shape of a pyramid now let's go back to chapter 4 verse 3 then we're going to pray for whoever despised the day of small things for they shall rejoice and shall see the plummet or the prime line in the hand of zorobabel with those seven they are the eyes of the lord which one two and four uh which run through and four to and fro through the whole earth as a summary the temple was destroyed by babylon that temple needed to be restored we built back to rebuild that temple it took joshua jerobel and a group of people that's going to be caught up into this move that group have priests they have leverage in other words they have preachers there ministers are you there they have the simple people from the house of judah [Music] are you there and benjamin also hooked himself there and we know benjamin is 144 000. let's pray heavenly father lord we thank you again for your grace your love your mercy and for everything you're doing for us lord you have given us another opportunity to gather together into your house lord we urge your word what anybody can do but unveiling this word it takes lord the anointing coming from thee father may you move me completely out of the way may you speak to your children lord father bless us may the windows of heaven open up lord and may the holy spirit that great inside teacher come down and unveil the eyes of the heart of your children father be the alpha and the omega of this service in the name of jesus christ amen joshua remnant of the people number one the rebuild the altar number two we have the foundation number three we have also the headstone my message this morning summarizing everything is who is this prince zero babel who is this prince the rubber bell we see a man there that is moving and trying to rebuild the temple who is this man you ready all right if you look at the star of david which is the flag of israel the flag of israel have a specific star i want you to stay really tuned have a specific star that is called the star of david sometimes the star is called the six point star of david because he have six point but if you look at this star closely with a spiritual eyes you'll see that this star have two pyramids that have merged together there is a pyramid that is looking down [Music] and there is also a pyramid that is looking up everybody following me and we know that when you spoke about the zodiac everybody should be comfortable with the zodiac now in this church the seals and the zodiac if you still have a problem you see me when we spoke about the zodiac we found out that the zodiac have to end the zodiac started with the virgin vigo and the zodiac end with leo the lion are you there and with virgin it was the first coming of jesus christ and when jesus christ came jesus christ came under a ministry called the cornerstone are you there because when jesus was talking to the pharisees jesus taught them he said the stone that they build rejected in the old testament when they were building the temple of salomon there was a stone that was a little bit funny there was a stone that was a little bit peculiar and when the builder look at that stone they kick that stone away they thought that stone was of no importance but as the builder continued to build the house they found out that they got in trouble because the progression of the house was stopped and then they come to find out that the stone that they were rejected was the main stone of the building so when jesus christ came down jesus stopped the pharisee he said remember the stone that the builder rejected that same stone became the corner stone and that ministry when jesus christ came if you notice you will find out that the pyramid is not looking up but the pyramid is looking down because jesus have to carry a sin god have to fall not because god sinned but because god took your place and he must go to hell and from health pick up the old testament sen and bring them up together are you there and then when we finish and jesus christ rose and goes back to heaven in the end time we found out jesus coming down according to revelation 10 and mighty angel came down but this time the pyramid is not coming down this way but the pyramid is coming down looking upward because down on the earth there is a church over there and that church had been building up and that church built up as a trapeze and that church was missing the cornerstone so the cornerstone must come down in the position of departure so as he come down he fits the building and once he fits the building he brings perfection to the building and he takes the church into the rapture are you there together praise the lord so this ministry of the end time is called the capstone or the head stone so the star of david put the two together he put the two hands of the zodiac together he put the alpha and the omega ministry together that's why we explained the ministry of defects which is the head of the women and the body of the lion are you there everybody good so far now as we begin to move when jesus left we found that parking when pogba came paul said that i laid the foundation and the foundation paul said was what and that cross was duh everybody clear you remember we are summarizing everything together are you there and then last week we found out that the church was built upon the foundation of the apostle and the prophet and jesus christ himself the chief everybody there so paul raised the foundation of the cornerstone but that foundation was just a part let's see this dedication the spiritual builders today and that is why the bride building of class is not ready for the broad group it's because that the builders has rejected the what the chief cornerstone that was led on the day off everybody clear on the day of pentecost which is there so when paul laid down the foundation the foundation that paul lay was what the baptism of the holy ghost and once the rubber bear comes because babylon entering are you there through the nicoletan spirit into berlin bellum into jezebel when babylon enter in somebody must restore the church back but the first message of the robber bell is go back to lay the holy ghost we are going slowly paul laid the foundation that foundation was just a part in the end time we found out that we have malachi 4. i showed you from 1 to 19. you should be clear with brother branham now malachi 4 malachi 4 had a ministry that means we will have the word once again as he was perfectly given and perfectly understood in the days of power i will tell you who will heaven it will be a prophet paul was a prophet jesus was a prophet brother branham was a prophet are you there it will be a prophet as thoroughly vindicated or even more why more totally vindicated because he must go higher than john the baptist are you there are you there thoroughly vindicating there was any prophet in all the ages from enoch to this day why because this man will of necessity have the capstone prophetic ministry everybody so when we look at the capstone ministry of brother branham we found out last week or the week before that we have two parts we are summarizing everything now this messenger of malachi 4 and revelation 10 7 is going to do what two things one according to malachi 4 he would turn the heart of the children to the we saw it last week which is bringing them to the foundation of the cornerstone the foundation of power because paul preached in part number two he will reveal the mystery of the seven thunders paul did not do this so he goes higher than paul in revelation 10 we charge the revelation content in the seventh seal so when the end time ministry comes first we have to bring back the foundation the foundation the rubber bill must bring back first the foundation are you there he must first start with the foundation he must bring paul back are you there after that foundation the foundation bring us back to what paul that's why brother branham said i preach like paul are you there that was before the seals but the second thing the foundation is bringing the holy ghost back the second thing when we're gonna see brother branham say today the methodist the baptist in 1953 the lutheran the pentecostal everywhere around if you don't watch out friend the real what you shall rejected and the cornerstone in the building of this spiritual house is down you are afraid of it you are afraid of fanaticism when the cornerstone comes when the foundation is laid some people shout some people whip some people roll on the floor the people the baptists the mentalities the pentecostal they don't want to do anything with him they said we don't want this kind of religion in our churches they were rejecting the cornerstone [Music] i know we got a lot of scarecrow and mockery why if there was not that there would not be a real one but there is a genuine article of the holy spirit in the baptism that is true all right and now they have rejected say oh we can't do that oh well we can't have that brother who so brother branham we stole back the cornerstone and the people rejected them praise the lord the second ministry is the capstone ministry because the hand of the robber bear brings the foundation and the same hand of zero babel bring also the headstone everybody clear and the headstone was the opening of the seventh seal now let's go to the book of haggai let's see who is this is a robber bell who is this zoroville you want to see how guy you go through the prophet throughout zechariah toward the end of the old testament just to help you up if you dare you can say amen the book of her guy chapter one thank you brother mike in the second year of darius the king in the sixth month in the first day of the month came the word of the lord by haggai the prophet to zero babel the son of shelter what governor of judah when we read they only say zero babel the robber belt the robber bell we don't know who was zero battle now it's clear the robber bell is who the governor off so this man calls the rubber bill or zorobabel his name zerobabel means born at babel let me take my time what does babel mean now our subject tonight begin in babylon and babylon was first located which it is in the channel and he was first called the gate of god what babel everybody clear bevel and ladder was called babylon which means confusion so baba means babylon in other words zorobabel was not born in israel so rubber bear was born in babylon they were taken captive in babylon when they got there zoral babel was born under babylon take matthew chapter one keep her guy because we're gonna go back to her guy keep your finger in her guy take matthew chapter one praise god matthew chapter one if you're there you can say amen a priest of judah not a priest of it's uh uh what do you call a issachar or naphtali but judah and judah that's where christ was coming are you there and the tribe of judah was the tribe that always tempted to marry gentile women are you there the children of judah went and married them nobody say anything when they were coming down to jericho is someone from judah mary rahab the prostitute nobody say anything in the time of roof bowers judah mary ruth nobody say anything only judah and judah was a tribe where the messiah the lawgiver was coming out the king was coming from judah but judah was always mingling with the gentile women not jews he doesn't like jewish women he only goes to the gentile and zoro comes from judah matthew chapter 1 verse 12. and after they were brought to what to babylon jacob and i are father who salathiel and salat are father who so so rob baby was born in in babylon but this matthew chapter one is the lineage of jesus christ look right here so the robber bear was off the lineage of jesus christ he was of the species the blood of christ zerubbabel means born a baby or born in babylon brother stephen say i show you that in the bible now today we have babylon go to the book of revelation keep your hair guy because we're going to go back to haggai go to revelation chapter 17 we miss detail and we don't understand our ministry now we're going down like a microscope brother stephen you going there there there there brother brother i'm saying this i have a blindness he said that blindness is near saturn they don't like details [Music] revelation 17 and there came one of the seventh angel we're gonna see that angel down the road which had the seventh vow and talk with me saying to me come here i will show you the judgment of the great who a prostitute that sits upon many waters with whom the kings of the earth have committed fornication and the inhabitant of the earth has been made drunk with the wine of her fornication so he carried me away in the spirit in the wilderness and i saw her a woman seated upon a scarlet color beast full of name of blasphemy having seven heads and ten horns and the woman was a red in purple and scarlet color and deck with gold and precious stone and pearl having a golden cup in his hand full of the abomination and filthiness of the fornication verse five and upon her forehead was a name written mr who the great the mother of who and the abomination of the earth so let's go back to our guy now so we found out that today we have a babylon that babylon is a woman called babylon the mother of harlot zerubbabel was born in babylon brother branham i dream that i saw a man that was supposed to be my father supposed though he was a great big man and i saw in the book of revelation we found out there was a woman i saw a woman that was supposed to be my mother only she didn't look like my mother natural mother and this man was very mean to his wife and he had a three-corner stick where he had cleft his wood you know and a chop of wood across a log you know it makes a three-corner stick and every time this woman will start to stand up he just grab her by the neck and hit her on her head and knocks her out a man with his wife but abusing his wife that's the dream brother branham saw what does he mean by the brand but the problem said he was supposed to be his mother the woman represent the church of the world today all the world i was born right in this so brother branham also was born under a mercy woman [Applause] and here i am she's supposed to be kind of my mother of a mother she was a mother of what so brother branham also was born in babylon but yet i was born right into it like zero babel her husband is the denomination that ruled over her the three cornersticks she that she had is a trying baptism in first name brother branham the woman represented the church of the world i was born right in this mess the mess that is in that she is in she was supposed to be kind of a mother she was the mother of what so cerebral bear was born in babylon born in a mess but of the lineage of christ and brother branham also says that god gave him a vision and he was born under babylon so robert bell was a governor a governor what does he mean take matthew chapter 2. i'm sorry keep your bible the bible say when the foundation is shaken what can the righteous do that's why we need to make sure the foundation is stable solid matthew chapter 2 verse 6 if you dare you can say amen and you bethlehem in the land of what again judah judah are you not the least among the princes of who judah for all of you shall come uh a governor that shall rule mine so jesus christ was also a governor brother stephen said a government that shall rule so a governor is somebody that rules it is somebody that is called a priest we following me take luke 20 20. jesus was a governor so robert bell was a governor so robert came under the lineage of christ who was the big governor a governor and the governor so robert ben was a governor jesus was the governor hey governor be governor hey son of man be son of man luke 20 20. if you dare you can say amen praise the lord and they watch him and send forth spies the pharisee which should fan themself just men hypocrite that they might take hold of his word so they were looking to accuse jesus that so they might deliver him to the power everybody see and authority of the so a governor is somebody that has power and authority are you following me now that governor came from judah what does he mean judah in revelation 2 9 brother branham is interpreting this scripture another works in tribulation and poverty but they are rich and i know the blasphemy of them that say they are jews and are not but are the synagogue of what satan to begin with the word jew does not describe the religion of the jewish people he refer only to the people of judah and has the same precise the same priestess meaning if i were to say i am irish born brother branham said the jew the tribe of judah is the true jews are you there and it's the same way that they call me i am an irish why did brother branham say irish close to judah when i was a liberal i was irish of course my conversion did not change that too much so when you are born in your country you're gonna be born under a certain influence the influence from your country and the influence from your family but when the holy ghost comes the holy ghost doesn't change you completely if you are an american you will continue to eat pizza if you are an african you will continue to eat fufu but both of you have the holy ghost the holy ghost only clean up the part that is wrong are you there so brother branham say he was born irish so there were stuff in irish that are very important for the ministry of brother branham but drinking like irish like his father that sad the holy ghost clean up and brother branham said that my conversion did not change that too much he kept certain things from the irish but he removed others i was an irish and my conversion didn't change that too much someone said do you think there is a change for a nourishment i said yes there is one of them in heaven his name is what brother branham said the nature of my god lynch ginger it is an irish nature you're gonna smell the message you're gonna think the message you're gonna talk the message you're gonna leave the message are you there no more playing games no skim milk in this church solid food are you there the nature of michael that temple of fighting are you there god did the problem to have that why did you get a brother branham it is from heaven there is one called micah and the shout at the voice of thee second miracle this is the way heaven will be they shall be german finns italian and even irish will be there amen i say i know there is one day they call him michael why is the nature of the entire messenger matches michael and when the lord shall descend with a shout with a voice of the archangel michael is coming down because there must be a one with the same caliber the same nature as michael jews are from judah tech roman chapter 2. who is this zerubbabel who is this zerubbabel romans 2 chapter 28 if you're there you can say amen you heard the robot there's a robot let's lay it down roman 2 are you there verse 28 for he is not earth which is one of the outworldly in other words not somebody who's by blood jewish is jew this is park saying that are you there neither is that circumcision which is outwardly in the flesh but he is a jew in other words the jew which is what are you there and circumcision is that of the heart in the spirit and not of the letter whose presence is not of men but of god paul is telling us that the true jew are not the people of judah in israel the true jew are the jews in heart are you there and we found out that the jews were the brethren of jeroboam jorah babel was from judah jeroboam was a jew he has also his other brother jews but he was just elevated in a position higher than his brother jews he's a part of the brother he is your brother he is your precious brother he only have a position of leadership amen i have seen her when i seen her this time she looked the same way and i was sitting there on this place brother brother i'm talking about the vision beyond the curtain of them and i said i don't understand this you put me up here so brother brandon when he went in the sixth dimension he began to hug people when they asked him he said you know what if they're gonna judge paul they're gonna judge me also ah my people will enter because i preach like paul that was before the opening of the seals if you go back in the sixth dimension today and you ask brother branham that same question he's gonna answer you differently he's gonna tell you not only did that preach like paul but i also opened the seals and brought the book of redemption down i preach more than power not at this time at this time it's more than power and when he went there brother branham hug people after a while they pick him up they go with him into a higher place they're putting them on them say wait a minute why do you put me in the position of a leader why do you put me in the position of a governor [Music] who is this is a robber you was a leader you were born a leader to lead the people i said don't mind well this is perfection say this is like a patriarch when they were gathered with there when you die you are gathered with your messenger and that messenger is your governor and just then a voice was went to talking to me i never did see the voice he said you have been gathered you have been gathered to your people and so and then some men pick me up set me way up on the big i think like this i said why do you do that said enough you was here everybody there and we found out in the book of hagai let's go back now in her guide chapter one lord help me to finish this everybody there go back to her guy chapter one if you dare you can say amen in the second year of the riots the king in the sixth month in the first day of the month came the word of the lord to her guide the prophet to who jeroboam you begin to get preacher about jeroboam born in babylon a governor of judah the son of sheldon governor of judah and to joshua everybody see there the son of jose deck their high priest so joshua is a high priest so this ministry of zerubbabel is couple it's connected to joshua we know that when moses was under his ministry moses also was connected with joshua are you there but joshua entered the promised land and moses was left out but with zoroable both joshua and zola babel entered the promised land joshua the high priest joshua who are you joshua was a type of who so jorah babe is not jesus he's a governor jesus is the governor but when he worked he worked with joshua joshua was a type of jesus because joshua means jehovah savior he was a type of jesus and as he sat there to begin to think yes and i remember the great warrior joshua hi how my mother used to say honey just across there just at the fourth right down there below the city joshua the great maori warrior who took moses place a top officer at top of the holy spirit now moses didn't bring the children into the promised land he wants the lord given but didn't bring the children in the promised land joshua took them over see and the holy spirit is the one that is taking them over now so the robber bear is working with joshua joshua at the top of the holy spirit why is joshua a high priest take hebrew because the first leadership priesthood came from the tribe of aaron are you there but when jesus christ died that priesthood was destroyed that's why when jesus went in front of kfs [Music] caiaphas took his cross and ripped them and once a high priest represents he is disqualified because the melchizedek priesthood was already coming in take hebrew seven bear with me give me time hebrew chapter 7 verse 11 if you dare you can say amen if therefore perfection were by the levitical priesthood for under it the people received the law what father need was there that another priest should rise after the order of melchizedek and not be called after the order of aaron paul is saying that if persuasion was under the law why do we need grace we need grace because perfection was not under the law we already preached you that are you there because the blood of bulls and god could not bring the worshiper into perfection it took the blood of christ a high priest under the order of melchizedek let's go verse 12. for the priesthood being changed there is made a necessity of change also of the law so we got to move from the lord to the bible the altar must be built according to the bible okay for all he of whom these things spoken pretend to uh neither trump the priesthood was coming from aaron you who are you aaron liver aaron liver errol liver but for some reason when melchizedek comes he doesn't go through aaron he choose a different trouble pretend to a trouble to another tribe of which no man gave attendance at the altar nobody from this tribe was permitted to work on the altar which tribe is it verse 14 for it is evident that our lord sprang out of what you understand you understand that and zorro babe came also from the tribe of he's under the lineage of melchizedek of which tribe moses spoke nothing concerning priesthood he was still under the seven seals and it is yet far more evident for that after the simulator of melchizedek there rises another priest who is made not after the lord of colonel's commandment but after the power of endless life he doesn't die the high priest died the high priest died when jesus died rose again he doesn't die in other words they cannot change him that's why he's the high priest that can be touched by the feeling of our the high priest brother man i'm saying the unfailing of god notice that he came first as prophet and they crucified him when jesus christ came jesus had three tattles he is called son of man he's called son of man which means prophet he's called son of god everybody there which means a priest or the priesthood and he's called son of david which is called he's a king melchizedek was priest and king are you there so melchizedek is the priesthood are you there hello so he came first as the prophet and they crucified him his own crucify him he came as the son of man a prophet then after the holy spirit came he was the son of god god is a spirit he was the holy ghost the holy spirit son of god he lived through there so throughout the church jesus jesus is a high priest he is a high priest after melchizedek are you there and it is under the high priest under the seventh church ages under the dispensation of the gentile that zoro babyliss boner are you there in the millennium he will be son of david sitting upon the throne of his father remember between son of god in love this year church a priesthood they put him out he's outside knocking in luke he said he will be revealed again as son of man the prophet fulfilling the rest of it the scripture dies perfectly son of man son of god son of david what is it it's the same god all the time just changing his form e more faith after his death burial resurrection he came on the day of pentecost as son of god a priesthood melchizedek the spirit in the form the holy ghost what was he doing he was changing himself making himself known to his people in a different form the holy spirit which is god he came to deal through the church ages as son of god the holy spirit so here we find out that joshua the holy ghost is working with jeroboam everybody there under the churches help me up that is the reason tonight starting this exodus of the church i believe that we are in there we are in the exodus again i believe moses being a perfect type of the church organization which fell moses worked with joshua but moses could not take the people to the promised land but not jorah babel so robert took the people and with joshua entering to the promised land without any problem what are you trying to say joshua took israel across the promised land perfect if you watch it how that god moved back there in the days what are you trying to say brother stephen like moses was the church age that brought them to santa to their theology of last night moses was not permitted to take the children of israel over in the promised land because he had failed the church organization denomination has failed they shall not touch the church over god will raise up a new system not moses another system with joshua the system of zero babel are you there an interdenominational system by the power of god he would take the church in the promised land organization and denomination has messed it up each one after their own theology each one after their own way of thinking but god will take his joshua and he will raise his joshuas that will take the church to the promise with no denomination or string tied anywhere that will take his church over joshua was called the capstone comes with what what are you trying to say what i'm trying to say is this every three years a great meeting what takes place a denomination but the problem says that every time god starts something big every time god starts a big move after three years it becomes a denomination even moses became a denomination but not zoro babel are you there this is 20 years no denomination dear dying lamb may never do that if i go in this generation if i die may the people who believe this message never stand still for a denomination are you there when a preacher begin to play around don't stand still get out [Applause] [Music] you shall die right in your truck remember that the very hour that you mentioned denomination among you i don't care how sincere you are take a man for your leader instead of the holy spirit to confirm this word that is the hour you die you don't need a preacher to confirm the message you don't need the preacher to tell you whether the message is right or not you need the holy ghost to confirm the message the day you gonna allow a pastor a preacher to confirm to you this message you die [Applause] we play too much for there is a new message coming forth a new thing try to hold it over but that's been the attitude of the church a revolver goes forth and defense things you know within about three years they start an organization over a denominational style organization but have you noticed this has been sweeping for 20 years now and there is no organization and there will never will be this is the end [Applause] you can become a denomination but the message will never be a denomination [Music] you can die not the message it's up to you to take choice and follow the message this time moses stay out joshua enter but with zola babe there is no denomination because joshua is always working with him him and joshua entered the promised land no denomination nobody left out no children left out no auntie left out no father left her everybody in the promised land hallelujah three category of people joe robert joshua and the remnant of the people from judah and judah are the jew the jew are the children of god they have the holy ghost the elect of that age are you there the temple was destroyed by babylon then in the book of haggai god tell israel he said go get the wood in the mountain and come and build the temple i'm trying to save time you can read it in the book of hagai when they went and built the wood we found out that wood spoke of humanity remember the series which was a church in other words this temple is built by people are you there now in the book of our guide chapter two let's go there i skip a lot of stuff so we can stay in good speed let's go there if you can verse 2 haggai 2-2 if you're there you can say amen speak now to zerubbabel the son of shetter governor of judah and to joshua the son of jose the high priest and to the residue of the people you see three group joshua zero babel and the residue the remnant who is left among you that saw this house in his first glory and how do you see it now is he not in your house in comparison of it as nothing in other words there were people that saw the temple when babylon came babylon destroy everything when you look it becomes nothing and god is asking a question he say how do you remember the glory of this temple look what it is now it looks like it's nothing are you there he moved from a big temple to nothing all you see is just wounds everybody there verse three who is left uh verse four yet now be strong also robert bell say the lord and be strong oh joshua the son of jose the high priest and be strong all you people of the land everybody be strong are you there if you notice in ezra you will see that an anointing drop on all three categories i can show you that are you there all you people in the land say the lord and work for i am with you in other words don't fear say the lord of hosts according to the word that are covenanted with you when you came out of egypt so my spirit remained among you fear you know for that saith the lord host of hosts yet once in a while and i will shake the heaven and the earth and the sea and the dry land and i will shake our nation and the desire of all nations shall come and i will fill this house with what with glowing so in the words of a bell restore the temple god is gonna fill the house are you following me with glory the silver is mine and god this man said the lord watch verse nine the glory of this latter house shall be greater than of the former so once the robber will rebuild the temple the glory of that tabernacle will be greater than the time of solomon but we have a problem you ready we have a problem brother pranam god came into the sanctuary that was to be anointed and was giving over to him for the people to come to worship that solomon so to anoint the holy but to are not the most holy place and we will notice that new jerusalem is the most holy you're following me god spoke that god according to daniel he will come and anoint the most holy brother brother said the most holy is new jerusalem and the anointing will be upon the new jerusalem that descend from god out of heaven prepare us a brother dawn for a husband remember last sunday when the angels say let me show you the brad he showed him what a city and we found out that that city was a woman because ephesus is a city smyrna is a city permanent is a city now this is a city all the church edges a city but the broad also is a city which is called the new jerusalem remember that now zwanzero babel dedicated his temple after he was rebuilt he was not anointed again god says that once the robber will rebuild the temple i will anoint it and that anointing will be greater but when zoroba debuted the temple which was the natural god did it anointed so which temple is zoro babel rebuilding are you there because he was already being anointed and been told that it was just instructed again the destruction has come to it it's been instructed again and put up so there was no anointing of it anymore when he was one time anointed that carried through and it goes until the very time see brother brother the city he goes ahead and say which is the new jerusalem the new jerusalem i shall put him i shall put on him the new jerusalem the bride or the church is there how many knows that the church itself is there you understand it now are we there we're clear now so there is an anointing that daniel say that must be anointed on the new jerusalem and when god spoke people thought when the natural zero bad comes when he rebuilt the temple that anointing would drop no anointing job but god said i will fill the temple of zorobabel who is zoro babel are you there we have three temples the temple of solomon was built destroyed by babylon and rebuilt again by jeroboam are you following me jesus also was the temple of god and jesus was destroyed by rome are you there because jesus said destroyed this and i would build it in he was talking about his death and are you there and when jesus resurrected the mighty angel came down are you there to pull jesus from the grave you're following me and then the other temple in the temple of in the book of fate on the day of pentecost we found a 120 temple and what happened babylon entering through the berkelen the palmer they're all the stuff and destroyed and we found together the mighty angel come down again temple destruction of babylon zero baby temple destruction of rome babylon rebuilding again and jesus when he was rebuilding he had a glorified body a body higher than the first body and the blood also was destroyed where they started at pentecost destroyed but down the road there is a restoration i will send you elijah the prophet in revelation chapter 10 we shall get into the 30 minutes in the days of the message of the seven angel the mystery of god ought to be finished here is the question if you follow in that line in this hour will it be finished will i find faith will have fun with malachi 4 fulfilling this time brother branham said when jesus was asking will i find faith what he was meaning that faith was malachi 4. the way god has through his churches from justification sanctification baptism of the holy ghost and now the ministry of the spirit which what which is what quickened the word that ministry in the church will have to be just exactly like his everybody there we found three temple temple destruction restoration temple destruction restoration temple destruction restoration because god does now are we there now let's finish zoro babel you tell me why brother john i saw you giving me a son okay praise the lord so let me be free i thought he was giving me a sign are you there we found out that zoro papa did three things number one we stored the brazen altar number two he restored the foundation number three he bring the headstone are you there the bride's an altar god's brass altar of judgment and you want to be born again just lay yourself upon there don't expect to pick it up again you are going to die that's the end of you that's all if you don't do that if you don't feel like it you can do that you can do you can do that don't don't try it it won't work deeply sincerely with about 10 pages more of this lesson here and more scripture are quit but lay yourself on god's brothers and altar of god's judgment and become just as dead to the word as christ was i'm gonna explain you this then we confess our sins before thee and land them on that blood as an altar of judgment and ask that the blood of christ take them away in the sacrifice that was made so the brazen altar was the altar where they were killing the sacrifice he was speaking about the atonement which happened on calvary so the beginning of the ministry of the robber bell he's gonna begin to preach divine healing because the atonement has healing and salvation you will see when zoro babel begin to work at the beginning of his ministry under the first pool he's more preaching healing and bringing souls to christ preaching healing and accepting jesus christ as your savior preaching healing and accepting jesus christ as a servant he was the rebuilding of the altar you're following me okay vada branham there is not a devil in hell that can touch you if you believe that you are covered by the blood you are surrendered by prayer ministers of the gospel and messenger of the covenant prayer every one of you standing here come up knowing that you had habits fault and things that you were ashamed of if you now lay them on god's bra as an altar of judgment and will accept it now as your pardon and christ give it to you will you make an offer by faith to rise up to raise up your hand and say are now accepted it's gone and from this day i shall never do it again you are saved by the blood of god so the brazen altar is the bringing of people to salvation that's what brother branham start with it first are you there then after that we found that the foundation was laid and brother problem said i laid the foundation the pentecostal the baptist the presbyterian don't want to do anything with it they're rejecting the cornerstone and the foundation was the genuine baptism of the holy ghost when it comes some people are crying some people are rejoicing everybody following me now brother brother says someone asked me to repeat that in hebrew again in job chapter 2 28 where he is picking off the coming of the former and lateral there is two run that was promising job it is the former end and the laddering the former reign comes to do something but the lagaran comes to bring maturity the former wren in hebrew word murray murray which means what that's why after the healing you will find out that brother branham begin to teach more what is the holy ghost what was the holy ghost giving for how you can receive all this teaching beginning to come it was the pouring of the first rain but not the laddering the ladder rain have to come with the opening of the hills are you there it shall be a teaching rain and a harvest rain now we have had the teaching rain and we are ready now for that watch he which year 62 and the seals were broken in which year so he's telling you we had the former end we are already led the foundation now we need the headstone are you following me praise the lord you know the first rain is when you plant the seed that starts your crop growing then just before we mature then come another crop that is what they call the harvest rain we know that the spring rain and then the rain about june it makes your crop now the rain we found out was what so there is they are pouring off the spirit to put the seed but later on the same holy spirit comes to unveil the word everybody following me now we found out that when joabel brings the headstone in his hand there is a plummet the head of zorro babe this planet is called also the prime line what is it what is the cause of this misunderstanding the answer is what brother branham said the trouble we have today is because of experience ah i have an experience with god i met the pillar of fire i did this this this the misunderstanding today we have gone by experience and not duh tell me your experience but your experience much much must match the world you cannot have an experience today and later on you reject the message we need to verify your experience are you there a way we've experienced us measuring are you there i have an experience fine let's see your life matching the world are you there i have an experience i met the pillar of fire and later on you reject that same pillar of fire check your experience are you there there is only one you didn't read there is only one one plummet one plumb line only one and that is the so the planet in the hand of babel is the word are you there and in sabino canyon when brother branham was praying he put his hand up and suddenly the sword hit his hand which was the planet we are measuring you by the sword by the world by the planet we are building the church by the sword hallelujah brother branham satan you lost we are coming over now we are marching over in the promised land because we are going zoro babel and joshua together are you there what is it what is this mountain before zero babel who is this stand before them you shall become a plane why is zoro babel destroying you

is written it is written it is written it is written it is written and satan look he said because the word of god will defeat the devil everywhere anywhere under any circumstances so rubber bell bring what the headstone who is this is a rubber bell hallelujah we are all acquainted with this scripture that reads the bible we know that this was during the time of the preparation of the restoration of the temple and the robber there was a great we understand that now among the people who had laid the foundation of the building now i want you to put on your spiritual thinking this is brother brother why brother branham anointing jacket this morning as we think brother branham is about to talk about zero baby he said i want you to put your spiritual jacket read between the line and this great priest had determined to rebuild the house of the lord when he did he had laid the foundation stone are you there the cornerstone 49 and as we read on further we found out that god said babel has laid the foundation with his hand he also shall bring forth the headstone i want you to notice he never said he shall bring the cornerstone brother branham is pointing you to something he shall bring there are ibraheem continues and we know that the scripture says jesus is the chief and he said he is also there the alpha and the omega the pyramid coming down and the pyramid coming this way are you there

the faith of the children back to the father in other words rebuild are you there the church again the church that was destroyed by babylon as shall we stole saying the lord he shall rebuild the church again under the power of the under joshua are you there not by not by but my mind the high priest said the lord not by organization not by denomination but by the way joshua the high priest god

the eyes of the blind man with the verse seven and said to him go wash in the pool of what salom which by interpretation means what i'm going to repeat again the pool of solomon which my

that pool and your eyes will be open are you there you need to go in the pool of zoro baby you need to go in the pool of the seven messenger because he's the one that has said if you wash yourself

usually a ring a man could not sign his name he just had the ring and he sealed it he ever was his ever what he wrote why he just instead of signing his name he put a seal on it so brother branham said the war is sealed instead of signing the name they just take the shield and seal it there it was the same as their signature let's finish with this jeremiah chapter 2 chapter 22 and we finished who is this prince zero babel jeremiah chapter 22. i hope i have the right scripture 29 i'm trying to see if i had the right scripture there was a king that the lord spoke about him yeah it's 20
