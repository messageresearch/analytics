enjoying that amen but I have to be in a room there preparing for the sermon amen we greet you all in the precious name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ both visible and invisible audience amen if we have any family members here here you know what let me have you have you SE for a minute because uh we got one uh visitor not even visitor I won't call him like that it's a family member it's a pastor from Canada he was here on Wednesday with brother Aaron he's a pastor in Canada got two churches one in Montreal one in Otawa and he goes back and forth preaching on two churches so he's here way in the back br bundu if you can stand and we will welcome you in spoken word thank you very much so some of you saw him on Wednesday and he's here for a trip uh just relaxing taking his time off a little bit relaxing as a pastor before he goes back amen I believe everyone is up to date with the sermon we are reading our Bibles two chapters a day if you have a problem with that I'll call brother to handle you clear amen amen and we reading our Cod our church ages the 70 weeks of Daniel the seals the adoption or somebody is in the message of the hour amen you're listening to the message of the hour there is nothing else that I can point you but the Bible and the message of the hour amen glory to God young sisters I'm still waiting for your date and young men meeting brother Kelly brother Robert if you can confirm to brother Enoch so we know and nail this completely for the month of uh May yesterday we had a question and answer which turned out to be a sermon I preach a sermon that I didn't even prepare and I went home I say wow I preach without an iPad without a computer amen and by God's grace that was wonderful things begin to to open up and I begin to see things clearly but thank God it was recorded so whenever I want to preach that message somewhere I will be able to do it amen and every single quote I handed to you it's on the church group chat I gave you six if I'm not mistaken about a fleece and how to place a fleece before the Lord so you know what it is you know what brother Bram say you know your position we don't want any foolishness because brother brandham God warned him in the seventh seal that hey do not go and start any easm or something like that just remain calm and clear and the Holy Spirit will lead you like a sister say yesterday we are already lamb so we already have a fleece but you will know when to apply it and how to move in the direction that the Lord wants you to do amen so God's that was his sovereignty he want me to handle one question so that was what we did so but it turned up to be wonderful by God's grace amen so you ready for the word let's go straight to our scripture this morning in Genesis chap 39 glory to God hallelujah let's see how far we can go by the grace of God Amen thank you Jesus you there Genesis 39 verse one somebody should even guess what we're reading amen amen 39 verse one and Joseph was brought down do you hear me okay well all the way to the back yes sister you can hear me better okay uh brother bundu you can hear me better praise God I already gave you a quote when the prophet is asking about the sons somebody need to respond from the audience amen am brother brandham say God gave Adam and Eve a wall of protection and that wall was the word of God that's right so your protection is to stand behind the word amen so my protection is to make sure whatever I tell you in this church amen I have to cover myself with the word of God Amen I must have a Bible scripture and a code and I protected myself so whenever you bringing your attack you not bumping against me you bumping against the Bible and the word of God and God will handle you yourself you will see me behind the word I'm saying hello God bless you if you bump you bump against brother Bram and the people who tried to bump against brother Bram go see what happened to them at the beginning it seems like everything is working after a while you're going down like a Titanic and a Titan amen because you challenge a Vindicated Prophet amen that's why whatever I do in this church everything the way I position even the music even the musician training I give you even the C the scripture for it I put everything in the word and I can go to sleep in peace amen because I place the people on the word and I know that one of these day the word that I have been preaching to you that word will take you to the brro amen that one I'm very confident because heaven and earth will pass away but the word of God will remain forever amen amen those that have been praying to be seated let's go with verse one first it's a relaxing my friend and Joseph was brought down to Egypt and Piper an officer of who Pharaoh you might be seated so they brought him to this man called Piper you know that he's a mil man Lord help me if I can reach there he's not a Christian believing the message he's a heathen he's an Egyptian he beli in a false god yes but he life is necessary for the Journey of Joseph he's very important amen amen he's a military man an officer of the Guard a man very close to to Pharaoh amen amen they never took him straight to Pharaoh m- you got to go through the P for house amen and the Bible says captain of the Guard an Egyptian bought him of the hands of the ishmaelite which had brought him down here that question is something ishmaelite amen they called them medanite and they called them ishmaelite Ishmael came from Hagar that's right and medanite came from K how can they be the same people this Bible is something amen amen and the Lord was with Joseph and he was a prosperous man and he was in the house of his master the Christian no the Hebrew no he was a master to Joseph how can God give you a master that is not a message believer verse three and his master so that the Lord was with him the Heathen man the adol M could discern that H this boy got a God Amen and that God is working amen amen amen he had other God they were not working for his businesses but when this God came everything begin to change so there is something particular about this boy amen amen amen the Bible say and then his master verse three so that the Lord was with him and that the Lord made all that he did to prosper in his hand yes remember Joseph is a slave amen that's right Joseph is a slave now he's a slave servant so he got some responsibility we clear amen amen glory to God verse four and Joseph found Grace in his sight and he serve him serve the hidden man the man that is not a message believer Joseph serve him Joseph didn't say because you don't believe the seven SE I'm not going to listen to you did that get it he didn't say because you don't believe brother brandham to be a prophet I'm not going to listen to you Joseph serve him so if Piper say I want to have my food at 5:00 Joseph got to bring the food at 5:00 even though Piper don't believe the message of the hour amen glory to God verse 5 and it came to pass from the time that he had made him what overseer somebody got a promotion in his house house and over all that he had that the Lord blessed the Egyptian house the Heathen house that don't believe the message of the hour the Lord blessed the Egyptian house for Joseph's sake amen and the blessing of the Lord was upon all that he had in the house and in the field so God didn't make a distinction God is focusing on Joseph amen and whatever Joseph touches God bless where Joseph is God bless him he's in the house of Piper guess what God begin to bless him do you know what happened to the Ark of the Covenant he was taken uhhuh and when he was taken somebody died and they stopped they say you know what we can't take the ark to the destination this is a trouble which house is around here oh this is the house of brother uh Joshua codo they say take the ark and put it there it there and when they put it there guess what the Lord begin to bless the house amen the ark was not in the Tabernacle he ended up to [Music] be hophazardly according to us in the house of somebody and because the ark was there God begin to bless them man and when David says you can't stay with that thing over there he forgot about killing somebody he say let me get that thing out of there because I can see that the blessing of the Lord is there wherever you put it it's going to bless you amen amen hallelujah verse 6 and he left all that he had in Joseph what hand and he knew not anything that he had save the what the bread which he did eat and Joseph was a goodly person and well favored now we found out that this responsibility of Joseph amen amen goes to everything that part far owns amen everything that party fall owns amen but we got some exceptions the first exception the food of P that one he still have some supervision on it so there is an area that belong to Joseph there is an area that belong to Piper right there is an area that belong to your boss that's right amen and you also got your job we clear on that one verse uh 7 and it came to pass after these things that his master's Wife cast her eyes upon Joseph and she said lie with me but he refused and said to his master's wife behold my master knows not what is with me in the house because everything is under his jurisdiction and he had committed all that he has to my hand that is his area he's d man there is none greater in this house than I the position neither has he kept back anything from me but who the so the second exception is the wife amen amen amen so these two things Joseph is not supposed to touch them everything else Joseph can touch it P if I have no problem about it but these two that's not your domain amen so when you go to a work place you will have your limitations that's right amen amen amen you will have your field of work amen and your limitations where you're not supposed to be getting they say this is for the supervisor only if you're not the supervisor don't go there are we clear amen look where Satan is attacking Joseph verse 9 uh verse uh 9 there is none greater in this house than I neither has he kept back anything from me but you because you are his wife how then can I do this great wickedness and sin against God somebody try first to get you off from your job responsibility right and you standing you say no no no no no no no no I know what I'm supposed to do this is not what I was uh appointed in this company for I'm supposed to do this not this that's the area the devil will get you amen will attack you verse 10 and it came to pass as she spoke to Joseph what day by day so she never told Joseph to do something that Joseph was already allowed that's right because there is no temptation there uhhuh the Temptation always will happen where there is limitation amen where you got restriction amen that's where the devil attack you amen come on if they tell you get into your work you can use your cell phone there is no temptation that's that's right because you can have your cell phone and doing whatever you doing and working no temptation but if they make you sign a paper and they say in this company do not use cell phone when you're in church do not use cell phon guess what that is when the devil will tempt you with a cell phone only when the church service is going on Amen and that's when they're going to send you an important text message only when the church service is going on because that's where you can sin and be off from your path that's right are we clear amen verse uh 11 and it came to pass about this time that Joseph went into the house to do what his business so somebody was going to do his business his field of action he went to his business he went to his work doing his work normal work prayed in the morning wake up good day oh it's beautiful outside praise be to the name of the Lord going to work and start singing Glory Glory Hallelujah didn't know what was coming up amen amen and then he went to do his business and there was none of the men of the house there inside so number one nobody's there nobody is there brother Bram even say that party for traveled I have the quote I give it to you if you forget I can bring it to you part for the master travel amen amen maybe whenever this woman was coming before and talk to him day by day maybe people were around and he said no I cannot do that I cannot do that so the woman made sure that day pipy is going where are you going I'm going to Georgia he say no problem it takes 4 hours to go 4 hours to come back that's 8 hours that's right so we got our Windows who's in the house nobody's in the house that's fine whenever there is no [Music] supervision amen amen that's when the Temptation comes amen amen amen amen the first time you refus you refus because pyer was there God did you refuse because they had a work was there and if he sees you he's going to tell pipa you know what I saw your wife and Joseph talking in the corner over there wow wow wow that is very easy to stay under commandment because somebody's watching you because the Deacon is sitting at the corner it's very easy not to touch the cell phone am so God will open up an opportunity where you have no supervision Amen to see if you obey the Commandment only under supervision or not supervision when mommy's there you're going to watch Christian movie God will take mommy and daddy away somewhere else and leave you the house to see what kind of movie you going to watch if momy and Daddy are not there amen if you don't pass that test you're going to stay in the house of partyer if you pass that test when there is no supervision then God shift you to another one amen amen amen there was a Preacher Brother Bram say he came to a church and he start preaching when he preach he goes repent yes they give him another sermon repent they give him a third sermon repent fourth repent fifth repent sixth repent the Deacon say uh-uh the pastor call him with the Deacon Bo they say BR this whole Big B here you don't see anything but repentance brother Bram say he say I have had a sermon but the problem is I will stop preaching repentance when the people change amen when they repent then I move you to the next step in other word if you don't learn from what God is trying to teach you you will stay in that class until you graduated amen until you pass the test then God will take you to the next level amen so stubborness is a Bad Thing amen because stubborness is only blocking you where you are amen until you will surrender and God will move you to another destination am amen are we together amen are we together amen jum to verse uh 11 again and it came to pass about this time that Joseph went into the house to do what his business and there was none of the men of the house there where within no supervision and she caught him by the Garment saying lie with me and he left his garment in her hand and fled and got him out she thought maybe this if I catch him I can get him but the boy was so strong and he and he stay with his faith regardless whether people are there or not there I still going to be loyal to my master I'm loyal in presence and in absence your loyalty have to stay there amen amen where are you heading Pastor let's go to First Corinthians chapter 6 Glory to God you know the destination of Joseph it's way toward the throne yes but before you get to the throne you got to go to a ground a boot camp to see how loyal you are under supervision and without supervision amen this is where we fell that's right that's and I'm going to show you even your work you fell and it was God using your work you thought there is a difference between here and church I will only serve God when I'm in church that's when I'm a Christian when we are not in church I'm somewhere else then I will change my clothing then I'll change my shoes under no supervision when brother Steven is not there that is where the devil will try to get you amen amen 1 Corinthians chapter 6 verse1 if you dare you can say amen amen the Bible say dare any of you having mother against another in other word does it happen that among you sometime you bad heads I said brother so and so look at me bad sister so and so past me didn't shake my hand oh sister so and so spoke to somebody about me I was not happy about it something happened between you something happened between the brothers something happened between the sisters in the church amen amen there any of you having a mother against another go to law before the what the unjust and not before what so God is saying if you have a problem one with another why did you take your brother to the court amen amen amen amen amen amen why didn't you take your brother with the sent amen amen amen amen why didn't you bring the problem to the church amen you took him to the law over there to the judge but that judge is a hidden and God is saying they are brother they are sent that can solve the matter correct in other word Believers are Judges amen can you say amen amen the amen is the name of God and can you say amen [Applause] amen bels are also judges amen amen amen amen are Judges really verse two is my Bible different than yours verse two do you not know that the what the Saints shall what judge the world do you see now amen in other word if something happen between you uhhuh and you don't know how to handle it you don't understand your future responsibility there it is amen I don't know if we are together are we together if you don't know how to sit with your sister with your brother and solve something and be done and clean it up because you sat together we thought the issue was finished and when you separated the issue still continue so something is wrong with you am amen somebody was not sincere if we spoke and you say I forgive you forgive me that problem should stop right there am but if tomorrow you continue with the problem something is wrong with you amen because we finished the problem yesterday why do you bring it up again today [Applause] you told me you understand me you told me you forgave me you told me I understand you so why do you come up with something else the next day God bless you brother Benjamin oh this is what was going on oh I'm sorry my brother I'm sorry everything is good good tomorrow you block brother Benjamin why did you block him I thought you and him spoke tomorrow I won't go to his house anymore I thought you finish the problem and God is saying if you don't know how to handle that look at the future responsibility Joseph if you don't know how to handle part for house amen look what I have in the future amen [Applause] but logos we talk together talk everything good we good good finish finish yes tomorrow brother stepen I'm gone I thought me and you talk come on come on I thought me and you talk brother Kelly we got a problem we talk with brother kayy

will bury you I have to squeeze that absess and that passes out until blood comes out when blood comes out it's a healing amen so no matter how much attitude you going to have I won't back up amen because at the end of the day you going to be healed amen and the only healing bomb that I have is the word of God so I will preach this message until all the passes are amen you want to un subscribe from this channel go ahead and [Applause] unsubscribe I don't want to stand before Jesus Christ with your blood because I try to please you we have to Baby them change diapers I mean 14 years old I have to change your diapers it's time sometime you get a whooping Jesus did it amen the humblest man amen whoop people in the temple amen and he didn't only whoop he got a table and roll it up amen that was Jesus Christ am with a full anointing rolling the table he look [Applause] rude amen amen amen [Music] if you coming to me and I see an infection and I told you you don't have an infection and tomorrow you ended up losing a whole jaw will you come to me to treat you [Applause] again I had people telling me I mean go ahead doctor just put that thing and say I was not trained for that regardless of what you need to find another then it's not me because if anything happen there you come back on me and do you know what the bo of Dentistry say you knew better than them regardless of what they want you know better than them that's what the pressure the pastor [Applause] have don't know where I'm going to go my friend where are we at my GPS uh verse 12 verse what no verse two vers two he said do you not know that the what Saints shall do what judge the world in other words Paul is saying a little matter you don't even know how to handle it can I say something in other word God allow those problem as a [Applause] training we cannot give you a big word to handle if you don't know that's why Jesus said if you are faithful on the little one so they have to give you little one am to train you for the big one [Applause] amen the Saints will judge not only the entire world you will Judge Joe B you will judge Jo Donald Trump you will judge Putin you judge everyone that is here you going to be sitting and say next [Applause] one let me leave it alone wait Sister Sarah ah you see Sister Sarah she will Judge Joe Baden before Joe Biden goes to heaven she need to stand he need to stand and say Sarah what do you think amen and Sarah will say let me check you first amen amen is that complicated no sir do do you see how big of a responsibility you have amen Hall brother Glen I don't know if I will move the Bible says do you not know that the saint shall do what judge the world judge the world and if the world shall be judged by who by you put your by who you as much as you exist you the world the world will be judged by you pastors will stand before you let me repeat it again pastors pastors will stand before you and you going to judge [Applause] them have I say something wrong no sir so the word got only unbelievers the world means the world that's right everybody that is there that's right the Bible say if the world shall be judged by who by you are you unworthy to judge the what smallest matters amen I gave you a little training look how you fell how am I going to give you the entire worldall are you are we together amen are we together am listen to this verse uh three he says know you not that we shall judge What Angels oh my God human being it's very easy now it's no longer human being even angels amen amen amen you will judge the world and you will judge who else Angel so Satan will be judged by you amen every demon will be judged by you amen so if you don't know how to judge human being how are you going to judge an angel maybe you don't get it listen to this the Bible says this in the book of Isaiah speaking about Jesus Christ the Bible says and there shall come forth a what a rod out of what the stem of Jess because he's the root and the offing of David amen so this is speaking about Jesus Christ amen if you need a coat you see me I'll handle you amen and a branch that branch is another name for Jesus Christ it's another title Jesus is also called de Branch if you need Scripture and quote see me send me a message I give it to you to make sure you stabilize amen amen and the road out of the stem of Jesse and a shall grow out of what Ro in other words Christ will come from the lineage of David amen which happened amen and the spirit of the Lord shall rest upon Him Upon Jesus Christ the spirit of what of wisdom and what and understanding the spirit of what of counsel and what and might the spirit of what of knowledge and the spirit of what the fear of the Lord what is the purpose of this qualification on Jesus Christ why does he need such a spirit the Bible say and shall make him of what of quick understanding in the what the fear of the Lord and he shall not judge after what the sight of his eyes and neither reprove after what the hearing of his ears so no matter how much you tell your story uhhuh that's not what Jesus really go by it Jesus doesn't look at you and then begin to judge you by the way you are amen am what are you trying to say that's why Solomon when God gave him the throne and God came to Solomon and say ask anything look what Solomon is asking God Solomon says give therefore who thy servant a servant a servant Joseph as a servant give what thy servant a what an understanding heart to do what to judge thy people that I may what discern between what good and bad for who is able to do what judge these such great people and the speech did what please the Lord that Solomon had asked what this thing that's why God told him and say Hey you a king I thought you going to ask for a long life so you stay on the throne for a long time I thought you going to ask for riches I thought you going to ask for the life of your enemy but you left all of that you went to the main thing give me an understanding heart and brother Bram say it was the gift of discernment Amen to know how to discern good and bad how to judge the people [Applause] correctly how do you judge people correctly two women MH come on sleeping in the same place come on both of them have babies on the same time best bodes all over besties forever but sometime one of them was too negligent and the other one took the time as was watching the baby and one SLP over the baby and killed the [Applause] baby and when the other one was sleeping snoring she went slowly and took the other baby out and S the baby and kept the other baby in the morning they one he say uh this doesn't look like my child he said this is your child no no no no no no this is your child this is your child guess what let's go to who to Solomon Solomon the king to do what to execute what Jud when they brought the two party it seems like either one is right but one was telling lies amen this one have his version this one have her version but one of them was was telling lie how do I de the LIE Solomon said bring me what sword what is the sword of God what happened in Sabino Canyon what happened in Sabino Canyon what came down from heaven and struck the prophet hand it's telling you judgment has begun [Applause] am when the sword was BR when the word can the word is a designer of the thought and the what intent of the heart he prove who was right and who was wrong how do I judge you judge by the word amen even if it's your wife judged by the word amen your husband judged by the word amen your best friend judged by the word amen your family be judged by the word amen you don't sit down and say this is my best friend so I'm going to back him up you don't back people when they're wrong amen that's right brother amen when you wrong you wrong [Applause] amen husband husband learn to sit with your wife and tell your wife that you see what happened between you and and so and so you are wrong amen you need to apologize wife name to sit with your husband and tell your husband you see what happened between you and brother so and so according to this matter you are wrong amen but not this is my husband this is my baby I'm going to stand for him you both of you will be anas and saf we going to heaven we are not playing games if it's your child put your child down you say you wrong I love you but you wrong go apologize to your brother go apologize to your [Applause] sister how do we judge people how do we stand for people this is my grandma this is family M we need to stand for each other no you stand when it's right amen I back you off but I will tell you that this is wrong amen you my M yes when you wrong I'm going to tell you you wrong amen [Applause] amen if you don't know how to do that how can God trust you how can God trust you you already biased from your home how can God judge you you already biased completely you always take you only take s because that's your best friend how can God give a judgment to you I'm expecting brother Kelly to look at me and say brother Steven that place you wrong period because he's a deacon brother Bram say an officer that cannot express his mind I will take him from the boat can you say amen amen do you need the [Applause] quot you know what let's just pray since we already took took off Heavenly Father Lord we are approaching you humbly this morning Father we thank you for your grace your love your mercy and for everything you have been doing for us this is the best that I can do with the ability you have given us father may you move me out of the way you're the only one that can interpret your word and bless your children I'm humbling myself and this church together Lord so that you can speak to us edify us change our life heal our body and Lord father give us a great service Lord in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen the scent will judge the what world and you will also judge What Angels what a great responsibility am listen to this this is the Lord Jesus Christ in John 7 verse 23 the Bible say if a man on the Sabbath day receive what circumcision that the law of Moses should not be what broken are ye angry at me because I have made a man every withold on the what Sabbath day so Jesus heals somebody on the Sabbath day and the Pharisee came they said no this is the Sabbath day you can't heal nobody Jesus turn around and look at them he said you know the reason why you're talking like this because it's not your child if he was your child he I see you and I come to heal him you won't say like this okay you know the law of Moses right amen you circumcise somebody do you wait for that day to be uh Monday or Tuesday or the Sabbath day if it's the eighth day whether it's on the Sabbath day or not what do you do you circumstance he say okay you did something good you respected the law what about healing somebody so we have to let this person die until tomorrow why because they already have a bad intent toward the lord Jesus Christ even if something is righteous they're trying to find fault with it that's right and listen what Jesus say Jesus said this in verse 24 judge not according to to the what but judge how righteous judgment never look at somebody because they got tattoo that's right and you say he must be the one that M upop they other the one that never even smoke might be more criminal than the one with a tto exactly right that's correct god rebuked brother Brahma and told him don't call those people Ricky because my children are there if you look at those children some of them got even ear nose that's right that's right ear pieces in the nose or whatever you call it what are you going to say this one will go to hell don't judge with the appearance s Samuel made that mistake God said go find the king do you know what happened Samuel getting there he look at somebody to he said this is the king look at his head he's going to feed the crown God say the Holy One doesn't look at appear the Holy One is looking in the he look good with a crown but he's probably the bad one and who called David a nauy boy who did it the one that was supposed to be king according to the appearance of men John 8 verse1 15 the Bible say ye judge after what the flesh I judge no man and yet if I judge my judgment is how is true why for I am not alone but I am the father that did what that in other words Jesus never judge somebody except the father in him does the Judgment that's right if the little matters you don't know how to judge how are you going to judge the world how are you going to judge the angel how do you connect this to Joseph amen let's go to verse uh three know ye not that we shall judge What Angels how much more things that pertain to what this life so God will bring small matters God will bring things of this life as a training am for the future so God is saying if small matters petty stuff and what things of this life amen you don't know how to handle that how are you going to handle where I'm trying to get you in other words God is using using these things as a training ground for your future position are we together amen are we together verse four if then you have Judgment of things pertaining to this life set them to judge who are least esteem in know what I speak to your shame that's right is it so that there is not a wise man among you know not one that shall be able to do what judge between his Brethren but brother goes to law with who with brother and that before who the unbel in other words you forgot your responsibility and you taking these things to the unbeliever if you the believer don't know how to judge how is the unbeliever going to judge am and you are going to be the one judging even the unbelievers what are you trying to draw this because we coming from the house of parer here Joseph with a responsibility under or no supervision now you jump quickly to the Judgment where are you taking me into let's go to the last scripture in Revelation 3 verse 21 amen if you dare you can say amen amen glory to God the Bible says to him that overcometh will I grant to do what sit with me where in my Throne what do you do on the throne what was Solomon doing on the throne I don't know if now we we getting together juding judging Solomon they put him on the throne he say the throne goes with judgment amen the throne is connected to judgment amen when you speak about throne you are talking about judgment and Solomon say Hey you give me the throne I need to know how to judge amen amen amen and God in the last stage the age of laia God is saying that if you overcome I will make you sit in what my Throne which Throne the Throne of who how many Throne is there one one Throne you're going to sit in one Throne yes so that Throne belong to him it belongs to Christ you're going to sit in his throne if you overcome that's why he say hey you don't know you going to judge the world you will even judge What Angels so how now we reach the End of the Age I'm expecting you to be at the position to be ready to judge this world amen amen are we together amen I will he will sit with me in what throne even as I have what also overcame and sat down with my father in what his throne when you overcome then you sit on the throne amen but the throne goes with judgment amen what are you trying to say there is only one throne here one how can everybody fit on one Throne because the saint will judge the Earth so the saint have Thrones but in the in the age of odia we found that none of us have a throne we only have one Throne that all of us will go sit there a let's go to Revelation 20 if you thereare you can say Amen if I decode this then we fly Revelation chapter 20 verse 4 the Bible says this and I saw what Thrones how many plural plural I want you to watch the scripture in Revelation 3 there was only one everybody sitting on that Throne follow me carefully now we got Thrones plural so how many Thrones are there we don't know the number so everybody have a throne so when you go to heaven how many Throne are we going to have if the brought these thousands of thousand of thousands so we going to have thousand of thousand of thousand of Throne no sir you need a prophet and I saw Thrones plural and they sat upon them so somebody was sitting on the throne how many are there we don't know the Bible continue he says and judgment was what given unto them so a throne goes with judgment amen what I was trying to Jo is Saint will inherit Throne amen Joseph will inherit the throne amen and Throne will go with judgment but you got to go through a training ground because if you don't stand the small training uhhuh how are you going to handle the big one the big one is more dangerous amen the Bible says and I saw throne and they sat upon them and judgment was given to them to those that sat on the throne and I saw the souls of them that were beheaded for what the witness of Jesus these are believers and for the word of who God and which had not worshiped what the Beast neither his what his image neither had receive what his Mark upon their foreheads and all of their what hands and they live and did what and reign with Christ for how many years a thousand years for you to Reign you must be on the throne so Throne goes with judgment and rulership am Joseph you going to rule Egypt s you're going to rule the world and you will be doing judgment how do you handle what I'm giving you for training how do you handle the things of this life that I bring unto you how do you handle the trials are bringing unto you it will determine whether you can go to the throne or not amen are we together now we got one throne here where everybody's there here we got Thrones who are they in that Thrones this is Brother Branham brother Branham say see the Brad is with who him where in the throne so our position is in this Throne we don't know about these Thrones amen follow me carefully the bride sits in the of Christ because we are joint him and I we are one but who is sitting on these Thrones brother Bram say and she is to judge the world Amen she has to be sitting where in the Judgment with him we clear amen that is exactly what Daniel saw Daniel 7:9 the Bible says I beheld until they were water the Thrones were cast down we see many Thrones again but the BR sit in the throne with Christ not in Thrones I'm going slowly and the anent of the day did what s that's where we are whose garment was white as what as snow and the hair and the hair of his head like what like the pure wool his throne was like a fiery flame and his will as burning fire there is a meaning to that and a fire stream issue and came for it's a it's a throne of judgment came forth before him and what thousands thousands ministered unto him thousands thousands Minister unto him and 10,000 times 10,000 did what stood before him so there were some that Minister unto him and some that stood before him amen are we together are we together but the brde cannot be standing amen the brde must be sitting on the amen are we together amen and brother Bram say and the Bible say and the judgement was what was set because Throne goes with judgment uhhuh and the books were what were open brother Bram interpret that he say see it is the same thing amen for the thousand thousand who are what ministering to him not the one that are standing before him but those that are ministering to him are the what the bride for who minister to the husband but what the wife if the brde is on the throne with him one Throne who sits on these other Thrones William Mar Bram brother Bram says notice this judgment was what was set Daniel again Daniel when he saw the throne at the Judgment they were how they were empty he seen the throne down what cast down come down from what heaven the ancient of of time came down from what heaven but when John saw it John saw Throne the throne were already what occupied by who Jesus watch that is one throne and the Thrones plural for the what disciples and what the Patriarchs redeem was already what fulfilled in other words the number of these Thrones is 24 wow John saw a throne and around the throne he saw 24 Elders uh-huh amen wow 12 12 and brother Bram said 12 are disciple and 12 by the patriar and brother Bram said the brde won't sit on those Throne those Thrones are for the TW patriarch and the 12 Apostle but the brde SE in his throne amen because we and him are one one are we together Amen brother Bram said Daniel 7 what did Daniel do he foresaw the what the Judgment SE see the city the throne was how was empty they were just putting the throne and they were supposed to be how empty as John in his time after the what raptured church because the disciple amen amen and the Apostle all of them are dead till right now amen all the Apostle are waiting for you and me so there is no way somebody can occupy the throne that's they have to wait for the Rapture of the church then after the Rapture they will go to their position am their position will be among the elders but our position is in the Throne of God Amen listen to brother Bram he say as John in his time after the Rapture Church they were what occupied by by the what redeemed Elders so when we say Thrones it's only 24 yes amen that belong to the disciple and the patriar but me and you we going to sit where in the Throne of God am to do what to execute judgment and to reign with Christ amen amen amen amen amen butam says this again in First Corinthians 6 he said do ye not know that the saint shall judge what the world not only will be the 12 Apostle uhuh and on the 12 Throne judging the 12 tribe of Israel but what the Saints in other word the Apostle will judge the Saint the patriarch will judge the saint and the bride will judge the saint amen but also will judge the what the world that is when these who claim to belong to God and claim that God love them will find out exactly who is the child of God and who is love of the son yes that day is what coming brother Steven you talking about throne and as in the age of laia you talking about throne and us because the throne goes with a judge if sent are going to be judged if the Saints the believer are Judges and the Saints are the bre of Jesus Christ amen what do you think the groom will be if we are Judges the groom will be what a judge a judge right that's why in this end time this picture here came amen and what does the picture mean William May Bram brother Bram say if you turn the picture like this and look you can probably see it from what the audience it is who is Christ see his what eyes looking here just as what perfect as it could be wearing a what the white wig of what Supreme deity and what judge prise the Lord why is he coming as a judge the age of laia is already given the promise to sit on the throne so the one you meeting is a judge amen the second coming is not a lamb it's a lion amen he's coming as the judge of Heaven and Earth amen so the judge is coming what is he coming to do because we full of sin listen to brother brandham brother Bram say can you see his what eyes nose and his what mouth the congregation says what amen just turn the picture from this the way they headed this way the way it's supposed to be can you see it congregation says what amen he is supreme what judge there is not but who him and that is a perfect uh-huh what identification again and a Vindication that this message is what the truth that is this is the truth it is what truth and making him not the third person but the what the only person why with the white see you see the dark his face his beard and his eyes and notice he's looking from him comes what this light shining from which side on the right hand side to which he was what looking to on the cross that is where he did what he looked to the what to the right where he pardon what the sinner the said the direction God was looking he was looking on the right side amen because that is the direction he forgave the sin at the cross amen why is God coming down as a judge but still looking at someone to forgive amen somebody to justify [Applause] amen go find me a scripture where Jesus told that fief that your sin are [Music] forgiven I'm giving you time to to think over go find me a scripture when Jesus Christ turn around and say you murderer your sins are forgiven he didn't get his word of baptism Jesus just turned around and say today me and you we going to be found where in Paradise how did he repented how did he get Justified listen to brother Bram everything that shall never die is constantly what rolling itself from the very thing happening to the picture being who Jesus standing looking at who us yes amen he was looking at us he was looking at the brother the one that is on the right side and now exactly on Sunset mountain and the sunset light the evening light has what come God Vindicated what himself what was it it is the fact that God and Christ are what one the white how many SE it the white wig upon him as we talk in Revelation one the Supreme what deity Supreme what Authority no other voice no other God no other nothing in him dwelleth what the fullness of the godhead bot the angel thems was what his way this message is bringing us our husband amen it is bringing us the judge himself amen not any judge but the Supreme judge the supreme authority because this is where we have into it in other word God put this picture so you can see the image of God and as you focus on the image we are transformed to be conformed to the image of the only son we are transformed unto judges amen that's why he left that picture so you remember you going to judge the world Amen you will judge also Angels amen your responsibility is big yes sir but to get there you got to go through the house of py my subject this morning is our journey through Joseph 5 garment we go on time my friend just relax part nine amen amen Shake somebody else hand and say God bless you the Lord second sermon amen you ready amen you ready amen we saw last Sunday that we are a we are air and we are also joint hair jint hair with who Christ with Christ whatever he is belong also to us and according to Paul Paul say that a hair as long as he's a child he defer nothing from a slave right or a servant in other word even though we are a to the throne even though we going to sit on the throne we're going to be judging the Earth we will be judging the world and the angel but when you are a child when you are immature when you are just born into the kingdom of God by default you are treated as a slave that's right you are treated as a servant God cannot take you from that position and put you on the throne you going to be a disaster on the [Applause] throne are we together are we together that position of a slave and the position of a servant is coupl with suffering amen the Bible says in Luke 24: 26 ought not Christ have to what offered these things and to enter where into his glory so before Jesus inherited the Throne of the father Jesus must suffer first that's right that's what he says amen Jesus must suffer first before he inherited the throne so no suffering no Throne no crying when you have to study and stay up because you have an exam tomorrow you won't graduated school is not easy school is hard homework is tedious test is and exam are hard but without them you won't graduate amen without them you won't get a board license that's right you get a pass them to get a license they want to make sure you won't kill somebody that's [Applause] right no I just want to be a doctor I just want to be an engineering but don't give me I don't want to go to school it doesn't happen like that you got to go through Tor uh-huh you got to go through instructors that's right you got to go under teacher you got to go through Governor so they can prepare you for the uncoming task amen you don't sit there and say oh we're going to have an operation bring the book you put the book where is the kidney oh my Lord you a butcher Butcher you a butcher you need to go cat Cow and army there but not human but if you want to hand a human being you got to go through [Applause] train and the Bible says that if not no suffering amen no glory and listen to the Bible second Timothy verse two Paul say if we do what suffer in other word we identify with suffering we shall also what rain with so you won R if you didn't suffer amen I want that to sock in amen even Jesus Christ before he received a new name he had to suffer he had to be rejected fely accused spit upon taken his glove and His Garment and they lie upon him they crucify him after the Throne all of that are taking you to your glory amen so when you see rejection when you see suffering when you see backbiting when you are crucified begin to thank God because what come after suffering is the glory amen what comes after suffering is the throne [Applause] amen are we together amen are we together amen amen before he reaches there even though he's Lord of all God have to put you through tutor those tutor are the people that God himself will choose that's right if you notice there are two words there one is a tutor and one is a governor a tutor is a private teacher yes sir somebody that work with a small group or somebody that deal one onone with you so God will appoint you somebody that will hander you [Applause] closer somebody that will be following you it looks like when is this person going to get off my back it is God that put him there because without that person you won't learn your future career on without that person you want to cut Corners that's right that's right a tutor is a private instructor and when you look at the governor is somebody who's teaching you about the laws about the rulle ship about the authority so God will CER a Ministry that will be teaching you and preparing you towards your position so sometime it will be teaching sometime it will be to make you recognize who you are and understand what is your task ahead it is God doing that through the farall ministry are we together are we together am so those teachers are appointed by God and the time is appointed by God if you go to university there is a time appointed for you to be an engineer they will tell you you go four years you get your degrees they will tell you you go 2 years you got your degree they will tell you you go three month you get your certificate there is an appointed time there is a teacher there there is an instructor there is somebody there to prepare you for the oncoming service amen that's why this road here as a servant this garment is a ragged one that's right because it's connected with suffering brother Bram says this glory to God you know Christianity has changed so much when in these last days Ah that's where the changing happened now you got to do what baby a person you got to promise them what a whole lot give them what a whole lot to make them what believe what to church even coming to church they got to beg you and promise them that they shall have a what better Associates and everything that is not Christianity Amen brother Bram say Christianity is not what baby but Christianity is how rugged it is Christianity is not a what a hot bed place you're not somebody that they have to put fertilizer all the time Christianity is ragged amen why is he ragged you got to have a ragged training amen because your task ahead is very [Applause] serious do you think they will get somebody and bring a person to you for you to do a heart surgery even if you're a normal doctor no if you want to do heart surgery you graduated as a doctor they send you again back to school to learn again more because the area you trying to deal with is more complicated so you need another training so your training your level of graduation goes with your position my my my am am if somebody else already got their position and you still struggling maybe yours is bigger than their that's why you still going to more adverse education I don't know if you getting me somebody else got married quickly you didn't get married yet maybe yours is a little bit better they got a good marriage but yours is better you need more training before you can handle one amen I don't know if you getting me let me start it again if somebody else is blessed today and you are not blessed today maybe your blessing is bigger than this so God have to give you more advanced training amen so you can handle your they can hand but you need to handle yours amen so somebody might have a graduate degree somebody might have a doctor degree somebody might have a certificate but God is training everybody according to their future [Applause] position brother Steven what are you trying to teach with this government the Garment of a slave what is going on with this government Hallelujah if you look on the future of Joseph the Bible says this glory to God that Pharaoh say unto Joseph for as much as God has done what show thee has show thee of this there is none so discreet and wise as what thou are we're looking at the future of Joseph he's in the house of py okay we put a pause in the house of Piper we're looking where Joseph is heading okay jph didn't know this we know it because we got the whole movie now when we look at the future the bible say that shall be how over by my house over my house and according unto what Thy word shall what all my people be ruled so all Egypt will be ruled by the word amen of Joseph amen so Joseph position was to rule with the word so whatever comes out from the mouth of Joseph all Egypt must obey amen and God saw how big that position was God say I need to put him under children the Bible continue he says only in the throne so Joseph had a throne only in the throne will I be how great than thou so Joseph had a throne and according to his throne everything he said to all Egypt must come to pass if Joseph come in the morning and say none of you go to work tomorrow nobody will go to work that's right you cancel all your job said amen if Joseph come he said tomorrow everybody will stay home sleeping all of you will be sleeping do you see how dangerous that is what about if somebody is in emergency they got to take him to the Hospital Joseph said no emergency no ambulance will work today kill people the Bible says this Joseph came in Egypt as a slave amen but his position Joseph had to move from a slave into a throne when we read this we think it's easy because we watch them so much in the movie in cartoons in Jehovah Witnesses stuff we saw all those picture now we got used to it we say ah Joseph was a slave and going to the King number one he was a stranger right that's right number two he was an Abomination he was not just a slave but a slave that was stranger a slave that was an Abomination a slave that was in another country and that slave have to inherit a big position higher than anyone except Pharaoh in the Kingdom of Egypt and all Egypt will be ruled by a stranger for you to understand the level of this in the book of proverb Chapter 30 verse uh 21 Solomon say for three things the Earth is disting in other word there are three things that when it happen the Earth is shaken the Earth is agitated he said and for four which he cannot what so they can't take it what are those three things what are those four things do you follow me Solomon say for a servant when he rain I'm reading the Bible in other word if you take a slave and you put him on the throne the Earth can't take it break it down every look he say no no no no no no not this stranger here this is an Abomination how can an Abomination be over there so what I'm trying to show you is the position that you are going into is bigger amen it's something that even your family never int you got to reach [Applause] amen don't worry he said for a slave when he went and a fool when he's filled with what How can a will have food we thought he's stupid but look at him God bless him let me pick up on this one for an audious woman when she is what mared do you know what odios mean a despised woman the woman that everybody say she's ugly she's ugly she's ugly and guess what God gave red a handsome husband all the sister in message can't take it they say oh my God I don't know I don't know how this is possible how can she have a be I mean a handsome husband like that I'm telling you this world we will see all kind of stuff I'm telling you this woman look at her husband she got the best we thought that man need to marry sister so and so who's beautiful but God don't work like that God will take the O your one and give her the best and nobody can handle it you can bear it but that's your problem that is God [Applause] choice and en hands man that is her to her what mistress who can Su that he said the mistress die now she's the wife brother stepen we need to investigate this situation when did it start that's why he was I mean he was always giving her the car to go to the you will come up with all kind of stuff because Solomon said the Earth cannot bear with me is my Bible different than your B in other words God is a god of paradise things that you cannot fix can happen will happen position that your mind don't have yet soon they going to happen if you look you don't qualify but what brought you there is the grace of God based on the training of God how can I be this way and inherit something like this how can I be despised and be in such a position it is God that [Applause] determin Joseph a big position when he speak everybody obey let's look at the authority of Joseph again in the future the Bible say in Psalm 105 he sent a man before them even who who was sold for a what a servant that's where we are who feet they did what hurt with feathers it's combined with suffering and he was laid where in Iron do you see what he had to go through until the time there is an appointed time that his word came his prophecy the word of the Lord did what Tried Him the king sent and lose him even the ruler of what the people and let him go how free how can you free a slave that was born slave and put there amen he made him Lord of what house so they didn't just free Joseph and say okay before you interpreted the dream you can go to your country no we keep you it's a strong intelligence it's going to work for the country if he can B the cyber security we need to keep him and work with him amen somebody understand what I'm saying and he made him Lord of what his house and ruler of what all his substance to do what bind his princes at his pleasure Joseph can put you to prison if he wanted to wow do you see how danger it is so guess what if you wake up in the morning you didn't Shake Joseph hand guess what get him to the prison I will show him whom I am if you didn't smile to Joseph guess what put him to PR that's why God have to train him that's right amen amen amen because he's going to bind anyone at his pleasure he's going to be like a god that's right amen doing F the way he wanted to do amen and teach his s to what wisdom if this is the position of Joseph in the future he's going to rule Egypt by his word by his word he's going to bind princes it's not that Joseph would take somewhere I mean some feathers and go and say princess I'm going to B that's not it he rule by what word when he speak whatever he speak happen if Joseph said take him to prison Joseph will turn around and go but your destination will be prison even though it take two hours that's right for you to get to prison after two hours he will make sure you in a prison amen so the word of Joseph has a power and no matter how long it take whatever he speak it's going to happen amen let me show you what I'm trying to say Amen if Joseph sit right now and say hey I need that Bible how long will it take for that Bible to come here how many seconds maybe one or two second the Bible is here but if Joseph say hey I need to see you in the prison in Charlotte how long will it take it would take maybe what half an hour so sometime the command might take a [Applause] while sometime the command might be quick sometime the first squirrel will come quickly that's right amen some time it will linger uhhuh but remember you already spoke amen amen don't linger it will happen Amen in other words sometime you will speak the word and something happen sometime you

the baptism pool and that word will give him the Holy Ghost are we together you are learning the third pool my friend amen the position the future position of Joseph is to bind everything by his word to rule by his word not by his strength by his [Applause] word in other word if Joseph want to move this Pulpit he just need to speak and but the pulpit will move he doesn't take his strength he

message young people independent people who want to do whatever they want no sir no sir we got to be disciplined by the message before you do anything you stop you say what did Brother brandham say about this what does the word say about this so when you know it's the word you discipline yourself and the devil won't touch you because you hid yourself behind the word are we together he says You must discipline people if you love them if your little girl was sitting out where in the RO as I said this morning making what mud cakes little tiny brain if you really love her you get her what off that road oh no he will cry the baby will cry if you touch that baby he goes and throw everything out undisciplined that's right I got to take that girl by force and get him off if I love him because if a car is coming I will be the one taking them to the funeral what do you want to do on Church Must Be disciplined let me see and the Bible say brother Bram say oh God may I throw myself with these people this week and may you what discipline us Lord you discipline us Lord to what your word we need discipline by the word what brother brandham say stop right there don't go over it amen even if your mind your brain you you are Albert Einstein remember the prophet spoke the word of God Amen humble yourself and the word of God Lord help me up amen if you notice this man called Piper is a military man why is military important in our training amen military is prone for discipline amen for respect amen for submission to Authority amen the first thing you learn in military before you learn the weapon you got to learn how to respect authority you got to learn how to respect whoever is above you you got to be disciplined you eat a certain time you sleep a certain time you wake up a certain time you got to act a certain way rigid and God took Joseph and put him on the military man why Matthew 8 verse five when Jesus was entered into what herum there came unto him a what a centurion a centurion is what a military man a centurion is a military man I hope you getting that amen amen amen beseeching him and say Lord my servant at home is how lies at home sick of lies at home sick with the py Grievous what tormented and Jesus say unto him what I will come and heal him the Centurion answered and say Lord I am not worthy that you should this what come under my roof but do what speak the word on power of Joseph is speaking the word only so the Centurion being a military man learn the power of order amen amen learn the power of the word am the power of command amen am speak hallelujah amen amen he says speak the word only and my servant shall be how healed for I am a man under what Authority having what soldiers under me and I say to this man do what go and this man do what and he go and now do what come and he does what he coming and to my Serv amen I do what do this and he does what do and Jesus heard it and he did what he marel and he said to them that follow him verily I say unto you I have not found what so great faith the greatest Faith the faith of the spoken word the faith of the Gentile was decoded because somebody understood Authority [Applause] that Faith was only decoded by a military man amen no one else decoded only a military because he was already trained under Authority amen this man decoded this faith based on his natural training amen I hope we talking that I so I hope you soing that God put this man in a military camp and he being in a military Camp he learned Authority he was a man under Authority so he learned how to obey Authority and by getting that training God used that training and flip him into the spiritual amen amen and he could be able to unlock the third pool before the time of the Gentile a military home a military home a military place a discipline place is important for you to decode the third pool amen the third pool was decoded because of understanding Authority and command why did God choose only a Soldier to decode the third pool and God said none on Israel have I found this one only the soldier could be able to decode it how did he decode it because he took his natural training and from what God was training him naturally that he thought oh maybe I'm going to be just a soldier I'm a senturion now he didn't know God use that Centurion ship to bring him to the third pool God use his normal job the training that you got on your normal job was leading you to the third pool I don't know if you get what I'm saying don't worry my friend listen to this the Bible says in Act 10 verse 1 there was a certain man in what in cesaria called what Cornelius a what a centurion why is God using military men to De call the third pool and military man to bring the holy spirit amen the first time to the Gen he drop in the in the home of a military [Applause] man why did Joseph go through a military officer the Holy Spirit fell on the Genta in a military home the first time that's right the third pool came to the Gent by a military man Joseph went through a military man got I learn decipline he says the band of the called the Italian a what a devout man the one that free god with what all his house which gave much arm to what the people and prayed to God what always do you know the condition to get the Holy Ghost listen to brother Bram he says full what obedience to the what full word of you to what the token so if this man got the Holy Ghost without the sermon of the Holy Ghost without even the laying on hand of the Holy Ghost Peter was preaching about Jesus Christ and something like that Peter didn't come and say I'm going to preach hard to receive the Holy Ghost thank you Jesus hallelujah amen amen amen don't worry my friend no other way is there you could ever be entitled to the Token until you do what fully obey the word not what somebody has put into it or add into it but what God has what said about it full obedience to the word brings what God you want a God in your life learn to be disciplined amen learn to obey amen obey what the word of God [Music] amen amen Running Out of Time thank you Lord go with me on Judges 3 so I can close here I can't go

your alarm and see what happened if they tell you come to work anytime you want and leave anytime you want guess what I won't show up I just want the paycheck I will never even go to work because there is no discipline brother Bram said the law when they put the light it's an absolute amen amen am because they got to regulate the circulation let's go to Judges chapter 4 3 verse one if you dare

humbly this morning this afternoon father we thank you for your grace you love your mercy and for everything you have been doing for us father this is a heart searching message but there is no way that we can do it without pressing the absess to get the pass out so that your children can find Healing because you sent the word for the healing of the daughter of Zion Lord God May the Holy Spirit help each one of us go and Ponder onto these things and see what we have been doing in our homes in our work in the responsibility that we got in church in the project in the business that we have how did we handle things what was our attitude how did we react what brought us to the situation that we are here father we went through our life we thought life is growing up getting a job moving but we never understood that all those steps the prophet taught us in the message leadership that all those steps you put those steps for a reason you say there is a time a mother teaches a child and there is a time a child have to go to under a teacher in school and until he reached the point where the child get to you father we miss with didn't understand this training we were against the boss that treat us bad those that were too rigid in our life that were too straight with us we didn't like them and we didn't understand that you the one that put everything in our path because you were training us for the future Lord father position but now that you have shown unto us Lord that you even use a normal regular job to prepare us for the task that is lying ahead Lord may we be wise enough to discern to discipline to open our eyes to look at the supervisor as a mentor to look at the supervisor the manager as a tutor to look at whoever the Lord put under us as a governor that is preparing us maybe we will learn how to handle our finances from somebody like that maybe we will learn how to go to a good bank through somebody like that maybe you will use somebody on the field that Joseph never met to direct him where his brother are but we miss those stuff because we were not taught right we thought we only handle those that have the Holy Ghost that believe the message like us but father you coming to help us to understand how to handle the people in the message and outside the message so that whichever way you're going to use for the training ground we don't miss anything but may we benefit for those from those training ground so that we can be where you want us to be for the benefit of us and our family and our own life we commit everything unto their hand and father we thank you in the name of Jesus Christ amen God bless you church we love you brother John we need the keyboard on if you want to know if you want to know where I am going where I am going
