[12:59] about three weeks ago
[13:01] i was getting up five o'clock in the
[13:03] morning cutting
[13:04] an onion and on a vegetable slicer the
[13:08] guard was up on three and i came down
[13:11] and sliced my hand
[13:14] i sliced it all the way down to the bone
[13:16] the nerve and the tendon
[13:19] my husband
[13:20] we provided me he cleaned it up the best
[13:22] way we could i worked a full day got off
[13:26] went straight to emergency i sat there
[13:28] for three hours and the doctor said well
[13:31] he said the tendon's not severed the
[13:34] nerve is not severed it came close to
[13:36] the bone but everything's okay i'm sorry
[13:39] there's nothing i can do
[13:41] i said okay so they put neosporin on and
[13:44] for some reason that burned really bad
[13:47] i got home and got that off and we put
[13:50] vitamin e on it and we prayed about it
[13:52] the doctor said you may take months for
[13:55] it to heal and then after that a plastic
[13:57] surgeon i said no lord
[13:59] i'm not believing that my son looked at
[14:03] my finger and he said the next morning
[14:05] we pray every morning before we leave
[14:06] and he said lord you touch my mom's hand
[14:10] and i've been trying to give this
[14:11] testimony for the last two weeks and the
[14:12] lord's been telling me to wait to wait
[14:15] to wait
[14:16] okay lord last week my husband said
[14:18] you're almost out of band-aids i said
[14:20] okay i said well when i'm done i'll use
[14:22] these other band-aids
[14:24] so i ran out of band-aids i believe it
[14:26] was tuesday
[14:27] and i looked at my finger and he said
[14:29] baby out of band-aids i said i forgot to
[14:31] pick some up
[14:32] wow i put his band-aids on him from work
[14:36] which allowed i guess the air to get to
[14:39] it went to sleep woke up the next day
[14:42] went to change it and i began running
[14:44] through the house i said babe it's
[14:45] healed i said my skin is growing back it
[14:48] completely covered over in three weeks
[14:51] i can clap i can move my hand i can type
[14:53] at work
[14:54] so i just want to give god glory for
[14:56] that
[14:58] [Applause]
[15:00] amen and amen amen bless the lord for
[15:04] that finger amen
[15:06] amen i also have a testimony man
[15:09] i wanted to give that uh this this one
[15:11] on wednesday but because of time i
[15:12] decided to push it today amen
[15:16] it meant so um
[15:18] what happened was that
[15:20] i fell into the hands of
[15:23] this kind of
[15:24] hackers
[15:26] that
[15:27] we hacked into our school system and got
[15:30] access to
[15:32] our student account
[15:35] and
[15:37] so the
[15:39] did this
[15:40] um advertising of jobs like work from
[15:43] home
[15:44] so because it was coming from the school
[15:46] i thought was coming from the school so
[15:48] i thought it was legitimate so i decided
[15:51] to follow up on it and then um
[15:56] they they engaged me for like three to
[15:58] four days were having chats and stuff
[16:01] like that
[16:02] they asked for my details and stuff like
[16:04] that but
[16:05] i didn't give out
[16:07] the thank god in the ask for social
[16:09] security and all that stuff because
[16:12] that was really private amen so um what
[16:15] happened was that i
[16:17] i had to open a different account
[16:19] because i didn't use
[16:21] i didn't want to use the account that
[16:22] we're using a different bank account
[16:25] so when i went to open the bank account
[16:29] we're still having this chat with this
[16:31] guy
[16:32] who introduced himself as
[16:34] whatever his name was
[16:36] whatever company he was working with
[16:39] and i thought was legitimate so i was
[16:41] following up with him
[16:43] and then
[16:44] what happened was that
[16:47] they they said that uh their company do
[16:50] this kind of donations to foster homes
[16:54] so what you're going to do as part of
[16:55] your job
[16:56] is to
[16:57] [Music]
[16:58] manage his account
[17:00] and then do the donation on his behalf
[17:02] to those foster homes so
[17:05] so he's going to
[17:06] transfer money to me every every week
[17:10] and then i'm going to do those donations
[17:13] to those foster homes saturday was
[17:15] legitimate right so um
[17:18] um he wanted to uh
[17:21] see how trustworthy i was so
[17:24] let me just send um
[17:26] any amount that i think i can send to
[17:29] him so he sees that uh i'm really
[17:32] genuine because there's a number of
[17:34] people who he engaged with and they
[17:36] didn't turn out to be good people and i
[17:38] said i'm
[17:40] i'm good i mean you can trust me so
[17:42] [Laughter]
[17:44] so then i he sent me a site a link to
[17:49] to buy a gift card
[17:51] to some foster home that's what he
[17:53] claimed
[17:55] um nothing um clicked in my mind that
[17:58] this thing wasn't right so i i tried to
[18:01] prove to this guy that i was not i was
[18:04] genuine
[18:05] so i transferred the money
[18:08] he gave me the link and and for some
[18:10] reason
[18:11] my bank started up
[18:14] giving alert
[18:16] that there was something wrong with this
[18:18] but i thought it was genuine so i went
[18:21] on and
[18:22] gave the go-ahead to the bank
[18:24] for uh
[18:26] for the deduction for my account
[18:28] but then what happened was that
[18:31] their uh website
[18:34] um sent me a message
[18:37] what happened was that the the lord made
[18:40] me to make an error in purchasing the
[18:43] gift
[18:44] so the guy said that the gift that i
[18:46] bought wasn't the right one
[18:48] so he asked me that okay um
[18:51] try and do it again try and resend it so
[18:53] that the next day he's going to refund
[18:55] me um the money
[18:57] so i decided to go back to the website
[19:00] and
[19:01] purchase the gift again
[19:03] but then the website told me that i
[19:05] shouldn't use the first card that i used
[19:09] so i was like okay what's wrong with
[19:11] that card so i decided to call my bank
[19:14] and
[19:15] we tried to resolve that issue
[19:18] and the bank said there's nothing wrong
[19:20] with it uh with a card i can go ahead
[19:22] and
[19:23] do that
[19:24] so
[19:26] once i was engaging with a bank a second
[19:29] guy sent me a text message
[19:31] so i was like okay the first guy has
[19:33] already told me that he was going to
[19:35] link me to his supervisor so i thought
[19:38] this guy was a supervisor
[19:40] so i was engaging with this guy
[19:43] and then he was like okay what's going
[19:45] on what did you buy what gave it looks
[19:47] like he didn't know exactly what i did
[19:49] initially so
[19:51] i said okay wait a minute do you know
[19:53] this guy
[19:54] the the first guy that i was talking i
[19:57] was chatting with
[19:58] so he said he told me that do not
[20:02] send any text to any other person
[20:04] so i was like okay if you guys are
[20:06] working together why are you asking me
[20:08] not to
[20:09] to reply to any other person
[20:12] and then once that was going on
[20:14] the other guy the first guy sent me a
[20:16] text
[20:17] so
[20:19] i asked him okay so who do i take orders
[20:21] from do i take it from you or the next
[20:24] guy and then this guy said okay i'll be
[20:26] careful of this fraud guys and all this
[20:28] and i was like okay
[20:31] i can see you guys i spam and then i
[20:34] sent messages to both of them i said i
[20:38] know you guys are fraught this but i'll
[20:40] definitely i'm going to track you guys
[20:43] and then
[20:46] so what happened was that you know uh
[20:49] my bank had already deducted that amount
[20:51] so
[20:52] and the reason why i'm giving this
[20:53] testimony is because of two things
[20:56] i wanted to speak on that money
[20:59] i wanted to speak on that money and i
[21:00] believe that whatever i spoke was going
[21:03] to take effect
[21:05] but then
[21:06] but then this voice dropped and said
[21:08] remember the prophet
[21:10] went like
[21:11] uh
[21:13] when like um he got his items so um his
[21:16] thing stolen and he was like he said a
[21:18] prayer and said lord i believe these
[21:20] people needed it more than i do i don't
[21:22] know if you remember that
[21:24] so that dropped in my heart that
[21:26] remember the prophet so i decided to
[21:29] keep mute
[21:30] so that the following day um i sent a
[21:32] text to our uh
[21:35] a chat
[21:36] a platform and
[21:38] wanted to give a testimony on wednesday
[21:41] because of the voice that came to me and
[21:44] and asked me not to do what i wanted to
[21:46] do
[21:47] so
[21:49] then i decided to call my bank and tell
[21:52] them that
[21:53] what happened was a fraud transaction so
[21:56] if
[21:57] they can put an outlet on that if they
[22:00] um they see any website trying to do the
[22:03] same thing let them know it is fraught
[22:06] so when i called the bank
[22:08] they were like okay
[22:10] we can't see
[22:12] anything on your account
[22:14] i'm like
[22:15] okay previously you have done a
[22:17] deduction
[22:19] but they said they can't find any trace
[22:22] of any
[22:23] um transaction in my account so
[22:26] everything was wiped off there was no
[22:28] trace of any deduction in the account
[22:30] the account stayed intact and i want to
[22:32] give glory to the lord for amen
[22:43] all right so we have um a prayer request
[22:47] from my brother joseph said i need a
[22:49] church to pray
[22:50] sorry he said i need a church to pray
[22:52] for my brother joseph he is an icu
[22:56] with a condition
[22:58] where his immune system is attacking his
[23:01] muscles

[23:07] induce coma

[55:16] yes
[55:18] lord
[55:19] [Music]
[55:30] [Music]
[55:39] hallelujah
[55:44] i believe it's a wonderful time
[55:52] being in the princess of the lord
[56:00] i just want to salute your friends in
[56:02] the name of the lord jesus christ
[56:05] and
[56:06] maybe you may be seated for a minute
[56:13] so glad to be here and it has been a
[56:15] wonderful time for me
[56:18] you know you can't imagine we're meeting
[56:20] for the first time
[56:22] but of course we met in internet before
[56:24] we came to
[56:24] [Applause]
[56:28] so it was special and
[56:30] i've been treated like a king i think
[56:32] they have confirmed that i'm a king
[56:39] yeah so
[56:41] i thank god that
[56:43] [Music]
[56:44] i made it here by god disgrace
[56:47] successfully
[56:48] and it was not easy
[56:50] certainly
[56:51] we'll always keep fighting
[56:54] but i always believe that
[57:00] anything you know if you have a ministry
[57:03] or a life
[57:04] that does not arouse the wrath of the
[57:06] devil
[57:09] then there is something wrong somehow
[57:14] so but if you have got that pill of fire
[57:16] that that hand of god following you
[57:20] certainly the devil will have to be
[57:21] desperate
[57:24] so there was some delays at the airport
[57:26] in michigan i mean detroit as i was
[57:28] trying to come here
[57:30] they came up with something like well
[57:33] the car that paid
[57:36] for your ticket has got issues this some
[57:38] fraud a lot on it
[57:42] so
[57:44] so i had to miss the plane the flight
[57:46] that i was
[57:47] come with
[57:48] and i was booked on the next one because
[57:50] brother chad had to drive
[57:53] all the way from lima to dayton
[57:56] to put that right
[57:58] they wanted to look at the cart to prove
[58:02] that i had not bought the ticket by
[58:04] fraud
[58:08] something that happened for the first
[58:10] time you know
[58:12] and then
[58:14] as i came here
[58:16] you know you've heard the story of what
[58:18] happened
[58:20] but i knew that the devil will always
[58:23] try to do something
[58:26] not because
[58:27] i am special
[58:29] but because i'm representing the special
[58:32] one
[58:36] and
[58:37] all of you are special that's why i
[58:39] think
[58:40] the brother was hit but somehow i got
[58:42] the warning that something is going on
[58:44] so i couldn't also sleep
[58:46] so i was awake praying
[58:49] then it's like god didn't want to show
[58:52] me what it is
[58:53] but i kept praying and when he rang me
[58:55] at eight i mean three a.m
[58:58] i said this is it
[59:00] so but i i know that god has always
[59:03] brought those things under control
[59:06] so i bring greetings to you from uganda
[59:09] from my family and
[59:11] the church the saints they sent it their
[59:14] greetings
[59:15] have been a while in the u.s so far and
[59:19] this is my first time to be here
[59:22] and i thank god
[59:23] i had a precious time with the sisters
[59:26] and the brothers brother michael omachi
[59:29] sometimes something like that
[59:31] at our at their home it was wonderful
[59:35] and yesterday was the pastor's home
[59:37] wonderful time
[59:40] you can't help but fall in love with
[59:42] these people they're
[59:43] they're they're so special
[59:46] amen so we were just laughing and
[59:49] chatting as if we have known one another
[59:51] for a long time before
[59:54] you know something clicks when you when
[59:57] when they elect meet
[1:00:03] you don't need a lot of introduction and
[1:00:06] some carefully whatever the cv
[1:00:13] that which is in euclix and
[1:00:15] because it's now time for the fellowship
[1:00:18] of the attributes of god
[1:00:20] so when you are an attribute of god
[1:00:23] definitely
[1:00:24] you can't help it
[1:00:26] but when you meet a child of god
[1:00:29] something will click
[1:00:32] so i think i i found a very nice
[1:00:36] welcoming atmosphere when i met
[1:00:38] brother stephen
[1:00:40] and the saints so far and i you know
[1:00:42] when i heard you people singing i said
[1:00:44] come on this is home now
[1:00:47] [Applause]
[1:00:51] i
[1:00:52] i i was always you know dashing out i
[1:00:55] was almost dashing out of my room to
[1:00:57] come and join
[1:00:58] [Laughter]
[1:01:01] yeah
[1:01:02] so
[1:01:03] i mean i
[1:01:06] i'm not really a good preacher i'm
[1:01:09] as some of you have already seen me
[1:01:13] i'm not a teacher i'm just
[1:01:16] i try preaching the word
[1:01:18] i leave the teaching to the pastors
[1:01:21] i just try to preach plain gospel to
[1:01:24] encourage the blood of christ
[1:01:26] around the world
[1:01:28] and that to me suffices
[1:01:31] so
[1:01:32] i would just request that we all stand
[1:01:34] up and have a word of prayer
[1:01:45] as we prepare to read the word
[1:01:50] let's pray loving heavenly father i want
[1:01:53] to thank you for such a day
[1:01:56] such a time that you've
[1:01:59] lord arranged and ordained that we would
[1:02:02] meet here
[1:02:03] with your
[1:02:04] children you are never
[1:02:08] surprised
[1:02:09] and you always know all about us
[1:02:12] whatever we go through
[1:02:15] whatever
[1:02:16] lord we are forcing in our lives
[1:02:19] there is no better blessing
[1:02:21] that you can bless us with than the
[1:02:23] blessing of your princes
[1:02:26] and i'm praying that god that ultimate
[1:02:28] prince's
[1:02:29] blessing will come
[1:02:31] upon us now and lord you are the only
[1:02:35] one who knows your children is needs and
[1:02:38] what they have gone through and what
[1:02:40] they are going through and
[1:02:41] what is a coming
[1:02:43] and lord is only you by your spirit that
[1:02:46] can lift up a standard
[1:02:49] against the enemy
[1:02:51] and lord we are not scared of the enemy
[1:02:55] because we don't live by the mercy of
[1:02:58] the enemy
[1:02:59] we live by the grace of god
[1:03:02] and we are praying that god will come in
[1:03:04] our midst and even anoint your servant
[1:03:06] and speak through these lips of clay
[1:03:10] that which you've ordained
[1:03:12] lord to edify to encourage and
[1:03:14] strengthen your children
[1:03:17] and even bless the reading of your word
[1:03:20] in jesus name we pray
[1:03:22] amen
[1:03:26] you're just trying to pick some
[1:03:27] scripture here in the book of
[1:03:38] in the book of genesis
[1:03:45] i think we shall pick genesis chapter
[1:03:47] three
[1:03:52] and um
[1:03:54] i want to read from verse
[1:03:56] six
[1:04:02] you know preachers these days don't
[1:04:04] preach different things we preach the
[1:04:06] same thing
[1:04:07] because the same spirit everywhere
[1:04:10] so don't be surprised if i come here and
[1:04:13] preach what has just been preached
[1:04:17] because it is the same spirit everywhere
[1:04:22] so genesis chapter 3 from verse 6.
[1:04:27] and he says and when the woman saw that
[1:04:29] a tree was good for food and that it was
[1:04:31] pleasant to the eyes
[1:04:33] and the tree to be desired to make one
[1:04:35] wise she took of the foot of the roof
[1:04:37] and did it and gave also and her husband
[1:04:40] with her and he did it
[1:04:43] and the eyes of both of them both were
[1:04:46] opened and they knew that they were
[1:04:47] naked
[1:04:49] and they sued
[1:04:50] fig leaves together and made them aprons
[1:04:53] made themselves a promise
[1:04:59] they had the voice of the lord god
[1:05:00] walking in a garden now i want you to
[1:05:03] look at that the voice is walking
[1:05:11] the voice of god walking in the garden
[1:05:14] in the cool of the day
[1:05:16] and adam and his wife heeded themselves
[1:05:18] from the princes of the lord
[1:05:21] the lord god amongst the trees of the
[1:05:24] garden
[1:05:25] and the lord god called and read them
[1:05:28] and said unto him where at la
[1:05:32] and he said i had the voice in the
[1:05:34] garden and i was afraid because i was
[1:05:36] naked
[1:05:37] and i hated myself
[1:05:40] and he said who
[1:05:45] which other voice which other person
[1:05:48] who told thee that thou art or washed
[1:05:52] naked
[1:05:53] has thou eaten of the tree wherefore
[1:05:56] commanded thee that thou should does not
[1:05:58] eat
[1:06:00] and the man said the woman whom thou
[1:06:03] gave is to be with me
[1:06:05] she gave me of the tree and i did it
[1:06:10] and the lord god said unto the woman
[1:06:12] what is this that thou has done
[1:06:15] and the woman said the
[1:06:16] serpent beguiled me
[1:06:19] and i did eat
[1:06:23] may god bless his word and bless you you
[1:06:26] may be seated
[1:06:33] i know a lot of this has been preached
[1:06:35] for a long time
[1:06:39] i'm not going to tackle the working
[1:06:40] voice
[1:06:49] but you know of course
[1:06:50] the bride will be the walking voice
[1:06:52] today
[1:06:55] and today we are not going to
[1:06:57] run away from it because we are eat
[1:07:02] we are not going to hide
[1:07:06] from the walking voice
[1:07:08] the walking voice is now in the bride
[1:07:12] because she
[1:07:15] will be the final voice
[1:07:18] to the final age
[1:07:21] a people
[1:07:22] under their prophet
[1:07:25] and that they are messengers
[1:07:29] and i'm glad that you still are under
[1:07:33] [Music]
[1:07:35] the lord
[1:07:37] blessed be the name of the lord and the
[1:07:39] devil doesn't want you to be under.
[1:07:47] but you see i was sharing with the
[1:07:49] saints the other day
[1:07:51] that you only have authority when you
[1:07:54] are under authority
[1:08:00] when you cut yourself from being under
[1:08:02] authority you lose authority
[1:08:07] so when we continue to be under the
[1:08:09] authority of the voice we become the
[1:08:10] voice
[1:08:12] and then our voice is not just a voice
[1:08:17] of a man or a man who believes in god
[1:08:21] but is the voice of
[1:08:22] god walking in a church
[1:08:27] blessed be the name of the lord
[1:08:30] and um
[1:08:32] i was thinking about one scripture
[1:08:34] as i was coming here i think the second
[1:08:37] corinthians chapter
[1:08:40] 14
[1:08:42] verse 8 he says
[1:08:44] for we can do nothing against the truth
[1:08:50] but for the truth
[1:08:52] [Music]
[1:08:54] we are handicapped
[1:08:57] when it comes to doing anything against
[1:08:59] the truth
[1:09:02] that is the elect
[1:09:04] that is the believer
[1:09:06] that is the manifested son or daughter
[1:09:09] of god
[1:09:10] you will never be able to do anything
[1:09:13] against the truth
[1:09:16] try it you will fail
[1:09:19] because you don't have the wherewithal
[1:09:21] what it takes
[1:09:23] to fight the truth
[1:09:25] because you are the truth
[1:09:28] fighting the truth will be fighting
[1:09:30] yourself
[1:09:35] which is impossible
[1:09:37] blessed be the name of the lord so today
[1:09:40] i want us to go to something
[1:09:45] about adam
[1:09:49] who heard from god
[1:09:53] about what god
[1:09:55] wants to be done
[1:09:58] and not to be done
[1:10:03] and
[1:10:04] this is the same man
[1:10:07] who had that before
[1:10:10] the woman was married
[1:10:13] because when you come in
[1:10:15] in genesis chapter 2
[1:10:18] i think in verse 15 he says and the lord
[1:10:20] god took the man
[1:10:22] not a man the man
[1:10:25] [Music]
[1:10:26] and put him into the garden of eden to
[1:10:29] dress it and keep it
[1:10:34] and the lord god commanded the man
[1:10:37] saying
[1:10:39] of everything regarded thou means freely
[1:10:42] it
[1:10:44] but of the tree of the knowledge of good
[1:10:46] and evil
[1:10:48] thou shall not eat of it
[1:10:51] for in the day
[1:10:54] that thou eatest thereof thou shall
[1:10:56] surely die
[1:11:00] then
[1:11:02] after he had revealed and you know what
[1:11:04] he once done
[1:11:06] to the man
[1:11:10] then he brings the idea of a woman
[1:11:14] in verse 18
[1:11:16] and the lord god said it is not good
[1:11:20] that the man should be alone
[1:11:23] i'll make him and help meet for him
[1:11:27] that comes after
[1:11:29] so we know that adam knew god's will
[1:11:34] before the woman was made
[1:11:42] and therefore the woman which is the
[1:11:44] type of the church was to come after
[1:11:47] the man
[1:11:48] of course adam represented the
[1:11:52] christ but not in the failure
[1:11:55] [Music]
[1:12:01] now something is here which is you know
[1:12:04] very weird
[1:12:05] because he knew the will of god before
[1:12:07] the woman is made and eventually god
[1:12:09] says for your sake
[1:12:11] just that you should have fellowship
[1:12:14] it's not good for the man to be alone he
[1:12:18] doesn't say it's not good for a man
[1:12:21] because there are some men who can be
[1:12:23] alone and they are comfortable with it
[1:12:26] but not the man
[1:12:28] because the man was created in the image
[1:12:31] of god
[1:12:33] and god
[1:12:34] is expressing what he is
[1:12:37] he knows that i'm also not comfortable
[1:12:40] being alone
[1:12:42] i will also get a bride for myself
[1:12:47] one day
[1:12:50] and that's why he says
[1:12:52] let us
[1:12:53] make man
[1:12:55] in our image
[1:12:57] and the name elohim comes in the plural
[1:13:01] it is presented as plural although it's
[1:13:03] singular
[1:13:05] why
[1:13:06] who is the letters
[1:13:10] the other part of him was also with him
[1:13:15] his wife was also in him
[1:13:19] in the attribute form
[1:13:21] and before she will be manifested
[1:13:24] so the man
[1:13:26] was created as a reflection of letters
[1:13:33] and the word that was given the man
[1:13:38] was given for both the man and and the
[1:13:41] woman that is him because this man was
[1:13:44] created in the image of god and now
[1:13:46] let's look it let me just go back a
[1:13:49] little bit
[1:13:52] in genesis
[1:13:54] chapter 1
[1:13:57] let's go verse 326 and god said let us
[1:14:00] make man in our image
[1:14:04] who is the hour
[1:14:07] that is written to blind in the
[1:14:10] trinitarians but
[1:14:12] they are not free
[1:14:16] but you know
[1:14:18] who is the hour when you look at the man
[1:14:21] that he has created in his image
[1:14:25] let us make man in our image
[1:14:28] after our likeness
[1:14:30] and let them
[1:14:31] now this man is at them
[1:14:38] let them have dominion over the fish of
[1:14:41] the sea and over the falls of the air
[1:14:44] and over cattle and over all the earth
[1:14:47] and over all ever creeping thing that
[1:14:49] creepeth upon the earth
[1:14:52] now listen verse 27 is so good not good
[1:14:56] not today
[1:14:58] so god created a man in his
[1:15:01] not in there
[1:15:04] but it is letters
[1:15:06] but the ass is his
[1:15:10] so god created a man in his own image
[1:15:14] in the image of god created he him
[1:15:18] but
[1:15:19] male and female created he them
[1:15:28] glory be to god
[1:15:29] now that is telling us who god is
[1:15:33] because this man was created in the
[1:15:35] image of god and this man is a man but
[1:15:38] he's both male and female
[1:15:42] in the spirit
[1:15:47] so as long as they are in the spirit
[1:15:49] they are always agreeing there is no
[1:15:51] problem when adam was just a man
[1:15:55] one
[1:15:56] but when god takes a rebound of adam and
[1:15:59] he makes a physical woman
[1:16:06] now here comes a chance for the devil to
[1:16:09] bring a double idea
[1:16:11] so that this man
[1:16:14] who was originally one in the reflection
[1:16:17] of god and god is the word
[1:16:21] is beginning to have two opinions about
[1:16:24] a word
[1:16:29] and that's why the devil brings this
[1:16:31] issue to the woman and says
[1:16:33] has god said
[1:16:38] now
[1:16:39] listen
[1:16:40] he jumps the pastor he jumps this man
[1:16:44] and he knows
[1:16:45] everything that adam was telling the
[1:16:47] woman was from god
[1:16:49] and his right
[1:16:51] has god's side creating some reason some
[1:16:54] doubt
[1:16:59] so they begin to have a double opinion
[1:17:07] and that's where the whole problem is
[1:17:11] and that's what saturn is doing
[1:17:15] when we moved
[1:17:17] from the mind of god
[1:17:20] from being just attributes and we were
[1:17:22] expressed here
[1:17:24] we are just supposed to still remain in
[1:17:26] the same mind of god
[1:17:29] same intention same purpose same vision
[1:17:33] same will of god but when we come here
[1:17:36] saturn is always attempting to create
[1:17:39] another idea about a word
[1:17:46] now i'm talking about recognizing the
[1:17:49] ministry's
[1:17:50] ultimate person and voice of influence
[1:17:59] who is that ultimate person
[1:18:03] what is that final person
[1:18:06] what is that voice
[1:18:08] that we should be influenced
[1:18:10] and the adam
[1:18:12] is telling god
[1:18:14] that the woman
[1:18:16] that you give me
[1:18:19] [Music]
[1:18:21] she has convinced me away from your word
[1:18:25] the woman that you gave me
[1:18:29] how dare you adam tell god that
[1:18:32] i gave you the word before i gave you
[1:18:35] the woman
[1:18:37] i gave you the word before i gave you
[1:18:39] the church
[1:18:41] i gave you the word before i gave you
[1:18:43] children
[1:18:44] and now you cannot send the children
[1:18:46] that you gave me
[1:18:48] they are the ones who are making me
[1:18:50] break your word
[1:18:52] or the church that you gave me
[1:18:54] is the one making me fail
[1:18:57] all the pastor that you give me is the
[1:18:59] one making me to fail
[1:19:01] you are a predestination
[1:19:04] you were in the mind of god you were
[1:19:06] part of god
[1:19:08] so what excuse are you going to give me
[1:19:14] [Music]
[1:19:18] man living in the shadows of excuses
[1:19:23] but god pointing you back
[1:19:28] in the beginning was the word
[1:19:33] not the church
[1:19:35] beginning was the word
[1:19:38] not your family
[1:19:39] in the beginning was the word
[1:19:42] not your friends
[1:19:44] in the beginning was the word
[1:19:46] not your deacons
[1:19:48] in the beginning was the word
[1:19:50] not your pastor
[1:19:52] in the beginning was the word
[1:19:54] not your husband
[1:19:56] what did you hear
[1:19:59] [Music]
[1:20:06] glory be to god
[1:20:13] i i always say i wish i'm a good
[1:20:15] preacher i wish i was then i would start
[1:20:17] preaching now
[1:20:23] so the devil brings
[1:20:26] people with ideas
[1:20:28] ideas in the families ideas and friends
[1:20:32] ideas nepal's and the purpose is to take
[1:20:35] you away from the world so that you tell
[1:20:37] god it was so and so
[1:20:47] and yet we are here
[1:20:48] to have nothing against the word
[1:20:52] but only for the word
[1:20:54] because the
[1:20:58] word preceded everything else
[1:21:03] and the word
[1:21:04] will outlive anything else
[1:21:10] so the ministry's
[1:21:12] person
[1:21:13] you know of influence now the prophet
[1:21:15] comes here and he's talking about
[1:21:18] influence of course you know he preached
[1:21:20] the message of influence
[1:21:22] and here he says you know there is so
[1:21:24] many of us and most of us influence
[1:21:27] somebody
[1:21:28] [Music]
[1:21:29] by the things that we do the way we live
[1:21:32] and the things we say
[1:21:34] we influence somebody
[1:21:38] somebody is watching your life
[1:21:44] now he doesn't say we influence
[1:21:46] believers
[1:21:55] so you have no excuse here
[1:22:01] somebody
[1:22:03] somebody's watching your life and
[1:22:05] then
[1:22:06] when we profess to be christians what
[1:22:09] type of life should we live if somebody
[1:22:11] is watching us
[1:22:13] and your life that you live will reflect
[1:22:15] an influence on somebody
[1:22:18] their internal destination will rest
[1:22:20] upon the way that you live and the
[1:22:22] things that you do for they watch you
[1:22:26] they watch you
[1:22:27] but you don't watch them
[1:22:31] they watch you
[1:22:32] but you don't watch them
[1:22:37] you are the light
[1:22:38] for them
[1:22:40] but they are not the light for you
[1:22:47] you are the reflection of god truth to
[1:22:49] them but they have no truth to show you
[1:22:53] the truth that is in you sets them free
[1:22:57] because they set you free
[1:22:59] now we influence somebody that's right
[1:23:05] but if
[1:23:06] a true child of god is being influenced
[1:23:09] by a man or a believer or a christian
[1:23:13] that gets to become wrong
[1:23:18] and i'm going to prove that
[1:23:25] so that's why we should not struggle to
[1:23:27] say i am like brother sons
[1:23:30] at least i treat you well better than
[1:23:33] brother son so treats his wife
[1:23:36] at least i am a better christian than so
[1:23:39] and so
[1:23:40] at least our pastor is better than at
[1:23:43] least my family is better than life
[1:23:51] you had to be like jesus
[1:23:54] to be like jesus
[1:23:58] to be like jesus
[1:24:03] that's what i long on earth
[1:24:06] that's all my journey is about
[1:24:08] that's what you are here for
[1:24:11] to be like him to reflect him to show
[1:24:14] his glory to stand for his word to look
[1:24:17] at him
[1:24:20] that is the person of influence
[1:24:23] and then he says
[1:24:26] now we see usia
[1:24:31] he was a great man and we find out that
[1:24:33] because that he took those terrific
[1:24:35] stands that he took
[1:24:38] terrific
[1:24:39] because if you go back and look at the
[1:24:41] life and testimony of mosiah he made a
[1:24:44] radical stance
[1:24:47] not to cut off himself from anything
[1:24:49] that was contrary to the word and as
[1:24:52] long as he did that he was very
[1:24:55] prosperous
[1:24:57] very strong
[1:24:58] very rich very famous
[1:25:00] until the prophet says
[1:25:05] terrific styles that he did that you
[1:25:07] know his kingdom was next to that of
[1:25:10] solomon
[1:25:13] josiah
[1:25:15] powerful
[1:25:21] he spread out even all the countries
[1:25:23] around about love him and he paid a
[1:25:26] tribute to his kingdom
[1:25:28] and we find out that even went down in
[1:25:30] egypt his influence was felt
[1:25:34] even in the world
[1:25:37] and this being the way he stood
[1:25:40] and this young prophet standing there
[1:25:42] before the king
[1:25:44] it was a great influence to isaiah
[1:25:49] so
[1:25:50] isaiah was influenced by a king because
[1:25:53] this king is righteous has made radical
[1:25:57] decisions to defend the truth and to
[1:26:00] live right
[1:26:01] and he thought i can pick my influence
[1:26:04] from this man
[1:26:11] and there are people in this world who
[1:26:14] can make radical decisions who can stand
[1:26:18] this you know in a way that you can
[1:26:20] think if i can only make it like that
[1:26:22] man if i can only stand like that sister
[1:26:30] [Music]
[1:26:31] that could be right
[1:26:34] but don't make your fixation of
[1:26:37] you know focus on that person and you
[1:26:40] think that person should be your
[1:26:42] ultimate person of influence
[1:26:47] that is still wrong
[1:26:52] [Music]
[1:26:55] that's why you see the prophet says
[1:26:57] every true preacher will never point you
[1:27:01] to himself but will
[1:27:03] point you
[1:27:04] to jesus to the finished work of calvary
[1:27:09] because i know i am a man
[1:27:12] i can fail
[1:27:15] but he will never fail
[1:27:18] i can fall rice for rice but he'll never
[1:27:22] fall rice full of rice he stays the same
[1:27:26] so now when we come to such a time
[1:27:30] our fixation is on one man
[1:27:33] what that is what does he say
[1:27:36] what does he say about me
[1:27:38] what is his word telling me
[1:27:42] so isaiah followed this man thinking he
[1:27:46] was right
[1:27:48] but god had to do something
[1:27:54] to take away
[1:27:55] isaiah
[1:27:57] from deriving his influence from a man
[1:28:02] [Music]
[1:28:05] and then he says
[1:28:07] it was great influence myself however
[1:28:09] the god would bless any man that would
[1:28:12] be true to his word this is very right
[1:28:14] god
[1:28:15] can bless any man
[1:28:21] that would be true to his word
[1:28:25] he says regardless of what he's hispanic
[1:28:27] his politics tried to influence him to
[1:28:30] regardless of what anything else tried
[1:28:32] to improve to be
[1:28:34] usia was determined to stay with the
[1:28:36] word and god blessed him and isaiah saw
[1:28:40] it
[1:28:48] but what does the bible say in isaiah
[1:28:50] chapter 6 verse 1
[1:28:53] in the year that king uzziah died
[1:28:56] [Music]
[1:28:59] i saw the lord
[1:29:05] [Music]
[1:29:07] so there has to be a time
[1:29:10] that the shadows of man die away
[1:29:15] the shadows of man is influenced
[1:29:20] do you know why even brother ranam was
[1:29:22] taken away
[1:29:23] [Music]
[1:29:27] so that we are not influenced by brother
[1:29:30] abraham the man
[1:29:33] but jesus whom we introduced
[1:29:36] the words
[1:29:38] the reality that he showed us
[1:29:44] glory to god so they're going away
[1:29:46] brother branham doesn't make the church
[1:29:48] weaker
[1:29:49] it makes the church stronger
[1:29:55] glory to god and the falling out of many
[1:29:58] men in the world today doesn't make the
[1:30:01] bride weaker it makes the bride stronger
[1:30:04] the children of god become stronger
[1:30:09] because
[1:30:11] our influence
[1:30:12] [Music]
[1:30:14] we push aside everything
[1:30:16] we look beyond man
[1:30:19] we look at the word
[1:30:21] we look at the reality
[1:30:23] that was revealed to us in this day
[1:30:26] jesus christ the same yesterday today
[1:30:29] and forever
[1:30:31] that's where we are standing
[1:30:37] glory to god
[1:30:39] so if it's about time that if you are
[1:30:41] looking at a sudden brother a saturday
[1:30:43] sister a certain pastor a saturday
[1:30:45] evangelist and you are trying to pick
[1:30:47] influence from him
[1:30:49] it's about time that that shadow dies
[1:30:52] out of your life
[1:30:57] so when that shadow dies
[1:30:59] [Music]
[1:31:00] you begin to see the lord
[1:31:04] now listen when isaiah was under the
[1:31:07] influence of uzziah
[1:31:10] he never could see that he had any clean
[1:31:12] lips
[1:31:19] because
[1:31:20] he had a body
[1:31:23] a bell a pile
[1:31:27] we grew up together we grew in the
[1:31:30] message
[1:31:31] we know one another i loved our brother
[1:31:34] i loved our sister
[1:31:38] the pastor we believed with him in the
[1:31:40] same year we grew up together i know him
[1:31:44] beyond the curtain
[1:31:46] beyond that level
[1:31:48] when you see beyond the isaiah when you
[1:31:51] see beyond a guru brother when you see
[1:31:54] beyond a guru sister
[1:31:56] when you see beyond a spiritual man
[1:31:58] and you see jesus christ himself
[1:32:02] you'll begin to see
[1:32:04] that you are undone
[1:32:12] and that's why sometimes
[1:32:16] god
[1:32:17] permits certain things to happen
[1:32:24] glory to god
[1:32:27] and you know all over the world they are
[1:32:29] happening
[1:32:30] all over the world
[1:32:32] key men key women
[1:32:35] that we had
[1:32:36] you know in his team looking at
[1:32:40] if that brother can make it i try to
[1:32:43] make make my life like him
[1:32:45] i i'll make it
[1:32:47] and then you find out
[1:32:49] what is happening
[1:32:52] what is happening lord
[1:32:55] what is happening lord
[1:32:57] that's not your end
[1:32:59] that is your beginning
[1:33:01] that's not the time to give up
[1:33:03] that's the time to pressure
[1:33:06] that's not the time to say lord i'm
[1:33:08] frustrated that's the time to say lord i
[1:33:10] get the revelation
[1:33:12] now i see
[1:33:14] now i see where i'm supposed to anchor
[1:33:17] my faith is supposed to be anchored in
[1:33:19] the world and calling me
[1:33:22] jesus
[1:33:23] standing on the words that will never
[1:33:26] fail and we thank god for maracai for we
[1:33:29] thank god for the message we thank god
[1:33:32] for the restorative truth
[1:33:34] we had god's own voice
[1:33:39] we heard god his own voice
[1:33:42] in the days of the voice
[1:33:47] in the days of the
[1:33:48] voice and we are not going to run away
[1:33:51] from the voice
[1:33:53] we are going to go
[1:33:55] until we become the voice
[1:33:57] in the days of the voice
[1:34:01] why
[1:34:02] why did the adam ride running to hide
[1:34:06] why did the adam hide
[1:34:08] because she he lived under the influence
[1:34:11] of his wife
[1:34:16] my wife influenced me
[1:34:22] i thought she is also a good preacher
[1:34:26] i thought
[1:34:28] she also is a good speaker
[1:34:31] i thought she also believed you like i
[1:34:34] believe
[1:34:35] i thought she got an alternative
[1:34:38] revelation
[1:34:40] i thought maybe things have changed
[1:34:42] somewhere
[1:34:43] my wife influenced me
[1:34:46] so when somebody influences you when god
[1:34:49] comes down you run away
[1:34:53] but when god is your influence when he
[1:34:56] comes down you run to him
[1:35:04] glory to god
[1:35:07] hallelujah
[1:35:10] and now it's not the voice of god
[1:35:12] walking in the garden
[1:35:14] it's the voice of god walking in the
[1:35:16] bride
[1:35:17] and we are the one walking with him he
[1:35:20] in us
[1:35:24] he in us
[1:35:26] the hope of glory the assurance of glory
[1:35:30] [Music]
[1:35:32] glory to god
[1:35:36] so you see
[1:35:39] that's where the devil wants to bog us
[1:35:41] down from
[1:35:44] and brother sister
[1:35:46] let me talk to you
[1:35:48] don't be that human not your husband i
[1:35:51] mean he is not supposed to refer to you
[1:35:54] as the cause of his failure
[1:35:58] but
[1:35:58] you should not also act in a way that
[1:36:02] his weakness can peg his life on that
[1:36:07] [Music]

[1:36:49] husband is just interested in playing
[1:36:51] tithe and singing songs and going to
[1:36:54] church and appearing christian but he's
[1:36:56] not a christian
[1:36:58] why should you be that man why should

[1:38:19] i'm just a victim i i'm not a culprit
[1:38:22] you said to me you gave me to preach
[1:38:25] this but the people are looking at me
[1:38:28] like do i do lord
[1:38:37] the church that you give me
[1:38:44] the church that you gave me
[1:38:47] lord i'm not the one who gave myself the
[1:38:49] church
[1:38:50] you gave me the church
[1:38:52] but now the church has become a problem
[1:38:58] would you be like you want to be such a
[1:39:00] church
[1:39:03] a church that becomes a problem to the
[1:39:05] ministry
[1:39:08] do you want to be such a pastor a pastor
[1:39:10] that becomes a problem to the church
[1:39:12] [Music]
[1:39:15] oh god we would be rejoicing we were
[1:39:17] okay we were in peace we were pressing
[1:39:19] on but the pastor that you gave us
[1:39:25] became a problem
[1:39:28] brought something else
[1:39:32] he left the channel
[1:39:34] what's this
[1:39:40] glory be to god
[1:39:44] and i want to thank god that some of you
[1:39:46] people are standing because you looked
[1:39:48] beyond a man you looked beyond a church
[1:39:53] you looked beyond
[1:39:55] ideas
[1:39:57] and you stuck with the what
[1:40:00] say
[1:40:01] come what mace
[1:40:04] i know what i've got is this truth
[1:40:07] i will never leave it
[1:40:09] i'm more than persuaded
[1:40:12] that nothing shall separate me from this
[1:40:15] let me separate with every man separated
[1:40:18] with every woman separated with friends
[1:40:21] separate with all that who would love me
[1:40:23] but let me stand with the word
[1:40:26] because i heard from heaven
[1:40:32] i heard from heaven
[1:40:34] i didn't hear from a man
[1:40:40] so
[1:40:41] all the osiris
[1:40:44] come out of the shadow
[1:40:46] god is now telling us reminding us all
[1:40:49] over the world
[1:40:50] come out of uzia's shadows
[1:40:55] if you remain under the shadow of usaid
[1:40:58] when usaiah collapses
[1:41:01] you will collapse
[1:41:07] and when usia is still the source of
[1:41:09] your influence
[1:41:11] you will never be perfected
[1:41:13] [Music]
[1:41:16] it is only when uzziah dies out of your
[1:41:19] life
[1:41:20] and you begin to see god
[1:41:25] and then what happens when you see god
[1:41:29] you see you are weaknesses
[1:41:31] [Music]
[1:41:32] you see you are unclean rips
[1:41:35] and you cry out to god
[1:41:38] say lord have mercy upon me
[1:41:41] all along
[1:41:42] i thought i was okay
[1:41:44] but now my eyes have seen
[1:41:47] i have been hearing about you
[1:41:50] through another person but now my eyes
[1:41:54] see you
[1:41:59] blessed be the name of the lord
[1:42:03] so here we are
[1:42:06] isaiah the isaiah the younger prophet
[1:42:10] lived under the shadow of the
[1:42:12] great spiritual
[1:42:15] rich
[1:42:16] and evidently successful man
[1:42:23] and the prophet goes on to say
[1:42:26] usaid was also influenced by his right
[1:42:30] as parents
[1:42:31] righteous and good fearing parents so it
[1:42:34] was like a continuation
[1:42:39] but isaiah was later proven wrong
[1:42:43] for basing his trust on a man and what
[1:42:45] does the bible say in jeremiah chapter
[1:42:47] 17
[1:42:49] cast be the man
[1:42:52] that puts his trust
[1:42:58] let me tell you friends we have come to
[1:43:00] a time that i don't even trust myself
[1:43:03] [Applause]
[1:43:06] i don't even trust myself
[1:43:12] without god in me i'm nothing i'm a
[1:43:15] failure
[1:43:20] don't even say brother abraham pray for
[1:43:22] me to have more faith
[1:43:24] the best faith that a man ever had is a
[1:43:27] failure
[1:43:33] but the bible says it's now the faith of
[1:43:36] god
[1:43:36] the faith of jesus christ in eu
[1:43:41] that's what the prophet says
[1:43:45] the best faith a man ever had was a
[1:43:50] failure the prophet says it's not you
[1:43:53] who is the believers christ in you is
[1:43:54] the believer it's the holy spirit in you
[1:43:58] and then he even says in another place
[1:44:01] he says
[1:44:03] when you receive the person of the holy
[1:44:05] spirit
[1:44:06] you already have all that you need
[1:44:08] between now and glory
[1:44:11] and you don't need faith
[1:44:14] you already got faith
[1:44:19] all that you need is
[1:44:21] how to operate that faith
[1:44:28] [Applause]
[1:44:32] glory to god just operate it
[1:44:35] you need to get an operational manual
[1:44:40] from the one resident in you
[1:44:46] blessed
[1:44:52] the church the wife the friends the
[1:44:55] children the husband you gave me
[1:45:03] they have convinced me to break your
[1:45:05] word
[1:45:12] the prophet says the first ones failed
[1:45:15] but this one will not fail
[1:45:19] and we have a predestination guarantee
[1:45:24] on this one
[1:45:26] that's why i i cannot you know i'm not
[1:45:29] afraid i'm not scared
[1:45:31] no matter what will come
[1:45:34] blessed be the name of the lord
[1:45:38] let me continue a little bit here
[1:45:40] and he says now that that is that's what
[1:45:43] made him such a great example to this
[1:45:45] young prophet
[1:45:48] at the same time isaiah
[1:45:50] isaiah the prophet lived in the days of
[1:45:52] uzziah king and both of them being young
[1:45:55] together
[1:45:56] bodies
[1:46:02] the prophet and the king
[1:46:04] and they were great charms together
[1:46:07] and isaiah stayed at the palace
[1:46:10] he leaned upon the arm of the king
[1:46:14] and
[1:46:15] and we find out
[1:46:17] that this young fellow's influence
[1:46:19] influenced isaiah
[1:46:21] he become a hero to isaiah
[1:46:27] because he was he made no differences in
[1:46:29] the people he never let anything sway
[1:46:32] him from one side to the other he was
[1:46:35] determined to serve god and serve god
[1:46:38] alone look at the description of usaiah
[1:46:48] but time came
[1:46:50] that he wanted to take
[1:46:53] an office
[1:46:56] that is not his.
[1:47:01] and that became his downfall
[1:47:06] and this is what i'm always praying lord
[1:47:08] let me never at all reach to a time that
[1:47:10] i feel so secure
[1:47:12] so strong
[1:47:15] so capable
[1:47:17] of tackling or touching that which is
[1:47:20] beyond me
[1:47:22] [Music]
[1:47:28] one brother was asking me brother
[1:47:29] abraham
[1:47:30] i think i was in kenya
[1:47:32] he said
[1:47:34] what is your view about this and that
[1:47:37] and that and the prophet saying this and
[1:47:39] this
[1:47:41] i said i'm not here to give anybody my
[1:47:43] views
[1:47:48] we are not in the days of views
[1:47:56] that when you talk about views that is
[1:47:58] reasoning
[1:47:59] [Applause]
[1:48:04] [Music]
[1:48:06] i said i have no view
[1:48:09] i just have a revelation
[1:48:15] and christ in you is the center of
[1:48:17] revelation
[1:48:20] i cannot share revelation with you
[1:48:29] it is him to reveal himself to you
[1:48:34] you tell ask him god reveal this to me
[1:48:39] not looking for my view
[1:48:42] i'm not here to share views
[1:48:45] the message according to brother so and
[1:48:47] so the message according to pastor son
[1:48:49] so the message according to this message
[1:48:52] according to that
[1:48:53] not the message being channeled through
[1:48:55] our filters again
[1:49:01] no
[1:49:02] but it means just like he took him
[1:49:06] glory be to god
[1:49:11] you see
[1:49:12] so he says you know he comes there is
[1:49:15] only one way to be a christian
[1:49:20] one way
[1:49:23] the word christian means to be
[1:49:25] christ-like
[1:49:28] and you can't do it
[1:49:31] in your own way
[1:49:33] you can't work it in yourself
[1:49:38] there is no way at all you can do
[1:49:40] it you have to forget yourself
[1:49:47] forget about yourself
[1:49:50] your interests your feelings your
[1:49:52] your likes and dislikes and this
[1:49:57] die out to yourself
[1:50:00] and let christ come in and live
[1:50:03] the life of christ in you that is the
[1:50:05] only way of being a christian
[1:50:11] forget about yourself
[1:50:12] forget about your likes and dislikes
[1:50:16] your ideas
[1:50:18] the way i see it brother
[1:50:23] [Music]
[1:50:24] and when you forget about your friends i
[1:50:27] mean yourself you'll forget about the
[1:50:28] usayas
[1:50:31] [Music]
[1:50:34] so he says
[1:50:37] and a man don't have to walk up
[1:50:39] nothing if he's a christian
[1:50:41] he is because he is
[1:50:43] in other words he's a christian because
[1:50:45] he is
[1:50:47] he that's what he's made up of he's a
[1:50:50] christian by nature
[1:50:54] that is supernatural that's not the
[1:50:56] signature
[1:50:57] that you're born with
[1:51:01] an apple tree is an apple tree because
[1:51:04] it is an apple
[1:51:08] [Laughter]
[1:51:12] i'm a christian because i'm a christian
[1:51:16] and because christ lives with me that is
[1:51:19] all
[1:51:20] so he says a peachy tree is a peachy
[1:51:22] tree because it's a peachy tree
[1:51:27] and a christian is a christian because
[1:51:29] christ lives in that person
[1:51:32] and christian makes i mean makes christ
[1:51:35] like not a membership
[1:51:37] but a vindication
[1:51:40] [Music]
[1:51:42] god
[1:51:43] producing through you just what a
[1:51:45] christian is
[1:51:47] not you getting out
[1:51:48] not i mean it's you getting out of the
[1:51:51] way and letting god come in
[1:51:54] you taking no thoughts
[1:51:57] let the mind that was in christ be in
[1:51:59] you there you are that's the real
[1:52:02] christian
[1:52:05] not when you see the trees good for food
[1:52:09] looks nice sounds good
[1:52:16] oh
[1:52:18] sounds good brother makes sense
[1:52:22] i see some sense
[1:52:25] [Music]
[1:52:27] we are not living by common sense i'm
[1:52:29] not i i'm not common
[1:52:33] [Music]
[1:52:37] common sense is for the common people
[1:52:40] i am not a common
[1:52:42] person i'm a person of revelation
[1:52:46] i'm a special person
[1:52:48] a royal priesthood a holy people
[1:52:52] a special people
[1:52:54] so leave common sense before the common
[1:52:58] [Music]
[1:52:59] i read by revelation
[1:53:04] common sense
[1:53:06] many even the disciples do not
[1:53:08] understand that john the baptist was
[1:53:10] elijah why say
[1:53:13] the eli the scribes
[1:53:16] that a liar is supposed to first come
[1:53:22] who was asking
[1:53:23] the believers of jesus
[1:53:27] they were going by the winds of common
[1:53:29] sense
[1:53:31] that were blowing around
[1:53:36] this is no time for messiah because the
[1:53:39] messiah cannot come without elijah
[1:53:42] coming and they were trying to challenge
[1:53:43] the disciples and the disciples bring it
[1:53:45] to jesus we are coming with common sense
[1:53:48] why should these people say
[1:53:50] they say
[1:53:52] they say
[1:53:56] that elijah
[1:53:58] must first come before messiah comes
[1:54:01] that is the wind of common sense it's
[1:54:03] blowing around what do you say about it
[1:54:07] elijah shall truly first come and
[1:54:10] restore all things but
[1:54:12] i say unto you that he has already come
[1:54:19] and they did to him whatever they
[1:54:21] witnessed
[1:54:22] [Music]
[1:54:26] common sense in john chapter one will
[1:54:29] tell you that john the baptist is not
[1:54:31] the prophet
[1:54:32] who are you are you that the prophet
[1:54:35] nope are you elijah no
[1:54:38] are you that jeremiah no
[1:54:40] but who are you
[1:54:42] i'm just a voice
[1:54:44] so common sense verbatim
[1:54:46] john is saying i'm not a prophet so i
[1:54:49] have a quote
[1:54:51] i have a quote
[1:54:53] john says i'm not a prophet
[1:54:56] who are you going to tell me that is a
[1:54:58] prophet
[1:54:59] and then jesus comes and says if you are
[1:55:02] to receive it
[1:55:05] if you among those
[1:55:07] who have packages to receive the
[1:55:09] revelation
[1:55:11] this is that elijah who wants to come
[1:55:16] so john
[1:55:19] pointed you to me
[1:55:20] and i am the one to reveal to you to
[1:55:23] confirm that he is
[1:55:26] so because you have not received the one
[1:55:28] that john introduced you don't
[1:55:30] understand the message of john
[1:55:37] glory to god
[1:55:40] but if you had received
[1:55:43] that's why when they questioned him by
[1:55:44] what authority
[1:55:46] do you do these things he didn't answer
[1:55:48] that question he pointed them back to
[1:55:51] john says the baptism of john
[1:55:55] was it of man
[1:55:57] was it of god
[1:56:00] now
[1:56:00] if we say it is of men
[1:56:03] the people stone us
[1:56:05] because the people know that john is a
[1:56:07] prophet
[1:56:08] but if we say of god he'll say why
[1:56:11] didn't you believe so we cannot answer
[1:56:14] aha now what do we say jesus also
[1:56:17] neither will i also tell you because the
[1:56:19] answer to your question
[1:56:22] is in the mystery that john introduced
[1:56:25] so if he had received the reality that
[1:56:28] he john introduced you will not have
[1:56:30] asked him in this question
[1:56:33] [Music]
[1:56:37] why
[1:56:39] because now
[1:56:40] is the dynamics
[1:56:42] the reality
[1:56:43] the horror power of god
[1:56:45] walking in human flesh
[1:56:47] and that was introduced by john now and
[1:56:50] because john was introducing the
[1:56:52] greatest reality ever to live on earth
[1:56:56] he never even performed a single miracle
[1:57:02] not even a single miracle
[1:57:04] and yet he was the greatest of all
[1:57:06] prophets that were born of women why
[1:57:10] because he creates he connected promises
[1:57:13] prophecies with reality he says he is
[1:57:16] the man
[1:57:17] he is the man
[1:57:20] so
[1:57:21] don't tell me about brother abraham
[1:57:23] brother browningham
[1:57:25] just simply introduced the man
[1:57:27] and now the man is here
[1:57:29] and a man with an open book go to the
[1:57:32] book got the anger and take the book eat
[1:57:35] the book
[1:57:36] digest the book you are going to get all
[1:57:39] that you need
[1:57:40] and you are going to prophesy again
[1:57:43] and when you begin to prophesy you are
[1:57:45] going to understand it
[1:57:51] that's why he says
[1:57:54] do you believe me to be god is prophet i
[1:57:57] i mean god is a servant
[1:58:00] [Applause]
[1:58:05] do you believe me
[1:58:06] to be goddess prophet i mean glory
[1:58:09] servant he's addressing two groups at
[1:58:12] the same time
[1:58:13] they are those who will never receive
[1:58:15] him as a prophet
[1:58:17] he is the servant they are those who are
[1:58:19] receiving him as a prophet
[1:58:22] some statement answering all of them
[1:58:26] well it's revealed it's revealed but
[1:58:29] it's not broken to the public
[1:58:31] where it's revealed it's not revealed
[1:58:33] it's revealed it's not revealed
[1:58:35] why the revealer that i'm introducing
[1:58:39] will reveal it entirely in you just
[1:58:41] receive him
[1:58:43] christ in you the center of revelation
[1:58:46] when jesus comes into you
[1:58:48] why is there the sabbath
[1:58:51] why did god say rest on the sabbath day
[1:58:54] the answer is not in the sabbath
[1:58:57] you will not find the sabbath on the
[1:58:59] seventh i mean the answer
[1:59:01] in the seventh seal
[1:59:03] the answer
[1:59:05] for the servant is seal is in the six
[1:59:08] scenes
[1:59:10] why did god rest on the seventh day
[1:59:13] because he had to finish the work in six
[1:59:16] days
[1:59:22] so
[1:59:23] he's resting
[1:59:25] that is
[1:59:26] quiet
[1:59:27] seven ish
[1:59:30] why
[1:59:31] because the mysteries are revealed
[1:59:34] now
[1:59:37] hallelujah
[1:59:38] that's why when abraham was preaching
[1:59:40] the seals
[1:59:42] he preaches up to the sixth seal and he
[1:59:44] opens the floor for questions and
[1:59:46] answers
[1:59:48] because all your questions are in these
[1:59:51] six seams
[1:59:54] but when he preaches why didn't he
[1:59:56] finish seven is a series first
[2:00:00] because seven is a seal no question
[2:00:03] that is the coming of him in you
[2:00:06] [Applause]
[2:00:11] no question
[2:00:15] answers for the seven is a seal
[2:00:18] behind the six seals
[2:00:25] blessed be the name of the lord
[2:00:31] you just die out you just disappear
[2:00:34] and he comes into you
[2:00:37] blessed be the name of the lord
[2:00:39] and then he says oh my there you are
[2:00:41] that's the real christian
[2:00:44] let me continue
[2:00:47] so you see he's giving her a reason
[2:00:50] will you be
[2:00:51] you will you like to be equal with the
[2:00:54] god that's how he started saturn started
[2:01:01] so adam gets insults from the woman the
[2:01:04] woman gets the influence from the
[2:01:06] serpent
[2:01:11] so when you begin to see this
[2:01:14] out for special reasonings coming
[2:01:18] questions
[2:01:20] questions that never used to be
[2:01:26] but coming now
[2:01:32] it's because saturn wants to put there
[2:01:34] another source of influence
[2:01:41] why didn't you people question these
[2:01:43] questions those days
[2:01:46] to see us
[2:01:52] why now
[2:02:06] why come now with the questions
[2:02:14] and who is the orchestra who i mean
[2:02:16] orchestrator who is the author of these
[2:02:18] questions
[2:02:21] who began
[2:02:23] who asked the first question in the
[2:02:25] bible
[2:02:47] whatever god he did was good was good
[2:02:50] was good was perfect
[2:02:53] and then the devil comes
[2:02:55] the first question
[2:03:02] who brings the first questions
[2:03:06] did the god say
[2:03:08] [Music]
[2:03:12] did the
[2:03:16] did the bible say this what about this
[2:03:20] and i preached about that i think many
[2:03:22] years ago i think 2017 in europe i was
[2:03:25] preaching in britain i i was pre i was
[2:03:27] titling it satan is demoting promotion
[2:03:31] versus god is
[2:03:33] promoting the motion
[2:03:44] because satan comes like he's promoting
[2:03:46] you while actually he's demoting you
[2:03:50] because he says
[2:03:52] god knows that if you eat you shall be
[2:03:55] asked
[2:03:56] as good
[2:03:58] when actually there were already goods
[2:04:05] they were already goods
[2:04:09] not us but they were real gods
[2:04:13] but saturn says if you eat this you
[2:04:15] shall be as
[2:04:17] gods
[2:04:19] yet they were already gods because the
[2:04:20] word of god was always coming to them
[2:04:23] every evening god would come and
[2:04:25] fellowship with them
[2:04:26] they were gods
[2:04:29] so it sounded like a promotion
[2:04:32] well awarded
[2:04:36] fine detail tailored statement
[2:04:41] the devil is a narrator
[2:04:47] you shall be asked
[2:04:53] when they were already gods
[2:04:57] [Music]
[2:04:59] and then the woman thought i'm going to
[2:05:01] be promoted
[2:05:05] [Music]
[2:05:06] when she was receiving a message of
[2:05:08] demotion
[2:05:10] wrapped in the envelope of promotion
[2:05:15] but for us today we received a message
[2:05:18] of promotion
[2:05:19] wrapped in the envelope of demotion
[2:05:22] you become nothing
[2:05:29] you don't you become nothing you
[2:05:32] disappear
[2:05:33] you die out
[2:05:35] then when he comes to live
[2:05:37] that is your promotion
[2:05:47] oh i wish i was like brother stephen
[2:05:50] you better come and take over brother
[2:05:52] stephen and fire up
[2:05:55] i'm an older man i'm finished
[2:05:59] glory be to god
[2:06:03] [Music]
[2:06:06] so in other words
[2:06:08] will you like to be equal with the god
[2:06:14] you want really to be right with god
[2:06:17] take my advice listen to me
[2:06:20] god didn't mean that
[2:06:23] it meant this it didn't mean this
[2:06:26] i give you to understand i have also
[2:06:29] just noticed it brother after all these
[2:06:31] years i've come to notice this meant
[2:06:33] this it didn't mean this
[2:06:40] lord oh god
[2:06:45] it meant this
[2:06:46] god didn't mean that
[2:06:49] he says when you hear that
[2:06:53] when you hear that
[2:06:55] get away from me through your fast
[2:07:05] that's right
[2:07:07] that is the hiss
[2:07:08] of the serpent
[2:07:14] it didn't mean this it meant here
[2:07:18] me in my understanding brother i've now
[2:07:20] realized this
[2:07:22] meant this this is wrong this is this
[2:07:25] shhh that is the heat of the serpent
[2:07:34] oh
[2:07:36] that is the heat of this happened
[2:07:38] it sounds reasonable
[2:07:41] but don't reason at all
[2:07:43] just believe the word of god what god
[2:07:45] said
[2:07:48] see what it was his reasonings brought
[2:07:51] her to know
[2:07:52] that it was right it was true the devil
[2:07:55] reasoned
[2:07:57] out of right
[2:07:58] into what seemed to be right when it's
[2:08:01] very wrong
[2:08:11] and this happened
[2:08:12] it was present to the eye and a tree to
[2:08:15] be desired and and brother abraham asks
[2:08:18] the congregation to make one have faith
[2:08:22] congregation says no
[2:08:26] to make one have knowledge
[2:08:29] will make one look wise
[2:08:32] and you know what is happening
[2:08:33] the message
[2:08:35] the way it came
[2:08:37] apparently for fools
[2:08:45] although fools
[2:08:47] they will not error the ring
[2:08:50] they will not error in the way of
[2:08:52] holiness
[2:08:53] so if you are not a fool you are in
[2:08:56] trouble
[2:08:59] [Applause]
[2:09:04] you want to appear smart
[2:09:07] intelligent
[2:09:09] reasonable
[2:09:13] speak like a man who has some education
[2:09:25] [Music]
[2:09:30] um okay
[2:09:33] to make man to make someone look wise at
[2:09:36] least see what it was
[2:09:38] saturn presenting knowledge
[2:09:41] knowledge that was controlled to the
[2:09:44] word
[2:09:48] to make one wise
[2:09:53] so their eyes
[2:09:56] of
[2:09:57] both
[2:09:58] of them both were opened
[2:10:02] and they knew that they were naked
[2:10:07] and they sued
[2:10:08] filled leaves together
[2:10:11] and made themselves aprons
[2:10:15] you see this is what is happening when
[2:10:16] you leave this message you begin to sow
[2:10:18] some kind of approach
[2:10:21] [Music]
[2:10:24] that cannot cover your naked
[2:10:28] [Laughter]
[2:10:32] because you know you are naked
[2:10:37] you know outside there you are naked
[2:10:40] there's nothing that can cover you
[2:10:42] no other truth no other denomination no
[2:10:45] other faith
[2:10:50] you become completely naked and it
[2:10:53] cannot help your nakedness but you
[2:10:55] pretend that you have covered yourself
[2:11:01] that's why i was telling the brother
[2:11:03] when you now leave the world you can't
[2:11:05] even go back successfully to egypt
[2:11:15] because the children of israel who
[2:11:17] failed to cross over to the promised
[2:11:18] land
[2:11:19] they couldn't even when they said let us
[2:11:22] make us a captain to go back to egypt it
[2:11:25] was impossible to go back
[2:11:28] what you know now
[2:11:30] makes you naked everywhere you go
[2:11:36] you you will try to look for something
[2:11:38] to cover yourself
[2:11:40] but you still know i'm naked
[2:11:44] because
[2:11:45] what covered you comfortably was the
[2:11:48] word
[2:11:50] [Music]
[2:11:54] but you something emanating from your
[2:11:56] brains from your reasoning
[2:11:58] [Music]
[2:12:00] it will never cover you enough
[2:12:06] says he says
[2:12:08] made them themselves aprons now what
[2:12:10] started it reasoning see
[2:12:12] faith has no reason
[2:12:18] faith has no reason
[2:12:21] you don't reason at all you believe
[2:12:24] when you are prayed before you accept
[2:12:26] god's word for him for your healing you
[2:12:29] don't reason with your feelings you
[2:12:31] don't reason with nothing else there's
[2:12:34] no reasoning into it god says
[2:12:37] say this so
[2:12:38] and that settles it
[2:12:42] amen
[2:12:44] i have to leave many things here
[2:12:52] blessed be the name of the lord
[2:12:54] amen
[2:12:56] let's go here somewhere in the scripture
[2:13:05] when you come to the book of i think
[2:13:07] exodus
[2:13:19] chapter
[2:13:20] 32
[2:13:22] i want us to look at something
[2:13:25] about the people
[2:13:28] and god
[2:13:32] exodus chapter 32
[2:13:34] and when the people saw that moses
[2:13:37] delayed to come down out of the mountain
[2:13:40] the people
[2:13:42] gathered themselves together
[2:13:44] and to aaron
[2:13:46] and say that to him up
[2:13:48] make us gods which shall go before us
[2:13:52] for us for this moses the man that
[2:13:54] brought us up out of the land of egypt
[2:13:57] with what not what has become
[2:13:59] of him
[2:14:02] as for this moses
[2:14:07] moses has become dismissed
[2:14:10] in a very short time 40 days
[2:14:16] not even profit
[2:14:21] [Music]
[2:14:24] 40 days
[2:14:28] as for this man moses
[2:14:32] look at that attitude
[2:14:37] with all the miracles they saw in egypt
[2:14:39] the miracles they saw the way
[2:14:42] the pill of fire the opening of the red
[2:14:45] sea
[2:14:53] water coming out of a rock for them
[2:14:58] look at that
[2:14:59] unbelief
[2:15:00] [Music]
[2:15:03] disrespect
[2:15:07] as for this moses
[2:15:13] [Music]
[2:15:18] they are gathering
[2:15:21] to the contemporary of moses
[2:15:24] the man
[2:15:25] moses's body
[2:15:28] the associate
[2:15:31] i was with moses
[2:15:33] we worked together we were with him in
[2:15:35] the wilderness
[2:15:37] i walked with him
[2:15:48] ask for these moses
[2:15:50] not even the prophet moses
[2:15:53] not even pastor moses
[2:15:56] oh
[2:15:58] this moses
[2:16:04] man that brought us up out of the land
[2:16:06] of egypt
[2:16:07] made us separate with our denomination
[2:16:09] the thinking is he having the truth
[2:16:16] i don't know how he convinced me
[2:16:21] i wish i knew the faults that i'm seeing
[2:16:24] now
[2:16:26] this man moses
[2:16:32] i don't know what has become of him we
[2:16:34] don't know
[2:16:37] and look at the body of moses the
[2:16:40] contemporary of moses the associate of
[2:16:43] moses what he's doing and aaron said
[2:16:45] unto him break off the golden earrings
[2:16:48] which here in the ears the ears of your
[2:16:51] wives of your sons okay even sons had
[2:16:54] earrings
[2:16:55] [Music]
[2:16:57] yay
[2:17:00] okay
[2:17:02] potential
[2:17:04] for idol idolatry they were carrying
[2:17:07] their potentials
[2:17:10] they were carrying their gods in their
[2:17:12] ears
[2:17:13] no wonder they could not hear the word
[2:17:16] and believe it
[2:17:18] because
[2:17:19] their god was in their ears
[2:17:25] having their eyes their ears seared
[2:17:32] seared
[2:17:33] they will never hear
[2:17:36] they are god's way on their ears
[2:17:45] so all of them with earrings can imagine
[2:17:48] men
[2:17:49] younger men women
[2:17:51] sure
[2:17:58] your wives your sons and your daughters
[2:18:01] bring them here to me
[2:18:04] and all the people broke off that that
[2:18:06] obedience comes automatically 100
[2:18:09] percent obedience
[2:18:11] to anything which is not the word of god
[2:18:15] you see
[2:18:16] you got it man
[2:18:18] we have influenced you now you can
[2:18:20] influence us because we know we are off
[2:18:23] from the original influence
[2:18:26] whatever you tell us we are now gonna do
[2:18:28] it
[2:18:38] and all the people all broke off the
[2:18:41] golden earrings which were in their ears
[2:18:44] and brought them unto aaron and he
[2:18:46] received them at their hand and
[2:18:48] fashioned it with a graving tool brother
[2:18:50] stephen everyone that where he kept the
[2:18:53] engraving tool
[2:18:56] all along
[2:18:58] he had it in his
[2:19:04] back the signs and wonders and miracles
[2:19:08] of the prophet are nothing
[2:19:10] like today they are denying they are not
[2:19:12] even regarding what god did the
[2:19:14] vindication that was in the prophet's
[2:19:16] life is nothing
[2:19:22] and the people who grew up seeing all
[2:19:24] these things
[2:19:26] he has got an engraving tool in his back
[2:19:30] just in a case
[2:19:34] i will need it one day
[2:19:37] one day i'll need it
[2:19:39] so all along around you have been
[2:19:42] carrying this the road
[2:19:45] and speaking
[2:19:47] miracles and putting miracles
[2:19:50] and in your bag
[2:19:52] and god made sure he never revealed to
[2:19:55] moses that this is a an arrow hiding
[2:20:01] an engraving tool
[2:20:03] [Music]
[2:20:06] that makes idols
[2:20:08] in his back
[2:20:16] all along
[2:20:18] mother thought i'm with a man who fear
[2:20:20] who believed the word
[2:20:23] no wonder he came back and broke the
[2:20:25] tables
[2:20:26] [Music]
[2:20:37] god have mercy upon us
[2:20:40] with him
[2:20:42] he fashioned it
[2:20:45] very beautiful according to the fashion
[2:20:48] according to the trend
[2:20:51] that the people's test can receive
[2:20:57] [Music]
[2:21:00] okay fashioned it with the graving tool
[2:21:02] after he had made it a mullet cuff he
[2:21:05] beautified it
[2:21:07] and they said
[2:21:09] this be thy god so israel which brought
[2:21:12] the app out of the land of egypt we have
[2:21:16] turned our back on the message
[2:21:18] that brought us out we've got another
[2:21:22] idea
[2:21:24] that will pressure take us home
[2:21:27] impossible
[2:21:28] [Music]
[2:21:30] that's manny's idea
[2:21:33] now look
[2:21:35] in there when aaron saw it he built an
[2:21:38] altar before it
[2:21:41] people to sacrifice
[2:21:45] and now look at what's going to happen
[2:21:48] and the aaron made
[2:21:50] proclamation and said tomorrow is a
[2:21:53] feast to the lord now that's the two
[2:21:56] gods religion now two lords
[2:22:05] i have not completely left the message
[2:22:09] [Music]
[2:22:13] there are suddenly things that i still
[2:22:15] believe
[2:22:16] certain values i still cherish
[2:22:20] if you look at my wife she still steals
[2:22:22] dresses like a message
[2:22:26] look at my children
[2:22:28] even me myself
[2:22:32] so today we can serve the golden calf
[2:22:35] tomorrow is the feast for the lord
[2:22:37] so we can alternate
[2:22:44] i have not completely left the message
[2:22:45] who told you that i've lifted the
[2:22:47] message
[2:22:49] i still serve the lord although we have
[2:22:51] an altar and then the brother the golden
[2:22:54] calf is here
[2:22:56] for those who are interested
[2:23:13] blessed be the name of the lord
[2:23:18] and then what happens and when you know
[2:23:20] in verse 6 and they rose up ally
[2:23:24] on the morrow this time
[2:23:27] ah their own family altar very
[2:23:30] serious sure
[2:23:33] you know when someone has backslidden
[2:23:35] he's going to fall asleep he will behave
[2:23:38] as if he's got the truth and he's very
[2:23:40] fiery
[2:23:41] and he's now like he got it
[2:23:44] you people who remain in there you have
[2:23:46] nothing
[2:23:47] [Music]
[2:23:49] regarded now
[2:23:51] very early in the morning
[2:23:58] rosa palin tomorrow and offered
[2:24:00] battlefronts and brought peace offerings
[2:24:03] and the people sat down to eat and to
[2:24:06] drink and rose up to play
[2:24:15] now we are going to see the double a the
[2:24:18] two tongues of the snake
[2:24:21] the same serpent that was in the garden
[2:24:24] of eden
[2:24:25] let's drop to verse 21.
[2:24:30] and we see
[2:24:31] what aaron says when moses comes
[2:24:36] when he is in the presence of
[2:24:37] the real source of the message
[2:24:41] what does he say
[2:24:46] and moses said unto aaron what did these
[2:24:48] people do unto thee
[2:24:52] that thou has brought so great a sin
[2:24:54] upon them
[2:24:57] and aaron said let not the hang of my
[2:25:00] lord works hard
[2:25:02] thou along with the people
[2:25:05] that they have certain mischief you know
[2:25:08] the character of these people they can
[2:25:10] be so rigged and so demanding and so
[2:25:12] pressing and so so what could i do you
[2:25:15] know you know you know
[2:25:18] you know
[2:25:20] you know you know
[2:25:24] verse 23 for they say that to me make us
[2:25:27] gods which shall go before us
[2:25:32] from god to gods
[2:25:37] for us for this moses he is reporting
[2:25:40] the thing
[2:25:44] for this moses
[2:25:46] the man that brought us up out of the
[2:25:49] land of egypt we want not what is become
[2:25:51] of truth of him that is true
[2:25:54] but now listen where the double tanks
[2:25:57] come
[2:25:59] when he's here he's saying this and
[2:26:01] doing this when he's here he's saying
[2:26:04] this and doing enough
[2:26:06] so he says
[2:26:08] that's 24. and i say that to them
[2:26:10] whosoever has any gold
[2:26:14] let them break it off
[2:26:16] so they gave it to me and then i cast it
[2:26:19] into the fire
[2:26:20] and there came out this scarf
[2:26:23] so the calf created itself
[2:26:33] he can't now mention that he has got an
[2:26:35] engraving too
[2:26:40] i i i never formulated this i never
[2:26:42] planned this it came upon me
[2:26:47] oh
[2:26:49] you threw the gold into the fire and out
[2:26:52] of the fire came the calf
[2:26:58] what a teaching
[2:27:04] now listen verse 25 back to genesis
[2:27:08] and when moses saw that the people were
[2:27:11] naked
[2:27:12] naked because
[2:27:14] they have been influenced away from the
[2:27:17] word
[2:27:18] just like adam
[2:27:21] and if
[2:27:24] we're naked
[2:27:33] when the mother saw that the people were
[2:27:36] naked
[2:27:38] for aaron had made them
[2:27:41] naked into their shame among their
[2:27:44] enemies
[2:27:49] naked because they left the world
[2:27:54] and the people are now seeing moses and
[2:27:56] trying to hide
[2:27:57] because they are naked
[2:27:58] but they were comfortable in the camp of
[2:28:01] arun
[2:28:04] until when the voice comes
[2:28:08] [Music]
[2:28:20] and the prophet says
[2:28:22] cause number one killer they say is
[2:28:24] hearty trouble no
[2:28:26] i differ from that
[2:28:28] number one killer isn't they had a
[2:28:29] trouble number one killer is the scene
[2:28:32] in trouble
[2:28:34] sin is unbelief
[2:28:38] that is the killer not had the trouble
[2:28:44] and he says for when the spirit of god
[2:28:45] is in you it lines up with the word of
[2:28:47] god and if it denies the word of god
[2:28:50] then it isn't you haven't got the
[2:28:53] got the right shot yet that's all
[2:28:56] you are not innoculated sin still lays
[2:29:00] at the door any belief in the word
[2:29:07] so it detects the toxin of god to kill
[2:29:09] sin and sin is number one killer
[2:29:13] yes it is it gives and it appeals to the
[2:29:16] uttermost
[2:29:20] so what are we looking at
[2:29:25] when you go to somewhere in the days of
[2:29:27] somewhere you remember saul
[2:29:29] when he was sent to go and
[2:29:31] you know
[2:29:32] kill the americans
[2:29:35] and he came back and said praise the
[2:29:37] lord i did everything like you told me
[2:29:40] and then the prophet is saying but
[2:29:42] what is this that i'm hearing
[2:29:44] [Music]
[2:29:47] says the people
[2:29:49] [Music]
[2:29:53] the excuses there's somebody
[2:29:56] [Music]
[2:29:57] and aaron is taking the excuse and
[2:29:59] saying you know the people
[2:30:06] the people you left with me
[2:30:08] they are the ones who made me to make
[2:30:11] a cuff
[2:30:15] friends should i tell people should i
[2:30:17] tell god that the church you gave us
[2:30:20] the believers you brought in the church
[2:30:24] are the ones that made me change from
[2:30:26] preaching the truth
[2:30:30] [Music]
[2:30:37] so i'm just here to tell you friends
[2:30:41] that there is approach
[2:30:43] there is an ambush that the davis coming
[2:30:46] with
[2:30:47] but we thank god we have got the
[2:30:49] assurance
[2:30:51] that a true bride is not going to be
[2:30:53] deceived
[2:30:55] she's not going to be swayed
[2:30:58] that's where my consolation is
[2:31:04] glory no matter what happens
[2:31:07] you may not be popular brother
[2:31:10] you will become unpopular
[2:31:13] more unpopular
[2:31:15] but you rather become unpopular here
[2:31:17] when heaven knows you
[2:31:23] look at how aaron is fidgeting with
[2:31:26] words
[2:31:31] guilty consciousness
[2:31:33] he knew better
[2:31:35] and he could have done better
[2:31:41] this man moses
[2:31:42] this man william branham
[2:31:45] he's no longer a prophet i don't regard
[2:31:47] him
[2:31:48] i have found out he's just a man
[2:31:52] after you've left egypt and you've come
[2:31:54] all away
[2:32:02] they're people you know their people
[2:32:03] they are hardy people they are
[2:32:05] complicated people they are very very
[2:32:07] very very very resistant they are hard
[2:32:09] people
[2:32:10] which people i had
[2:32:15] i think we preachers are more
[2:32:17] responsible for the complications and
[2:32:19] confusions in the churches
[2:32:25] we are more responsible for all the
[2:32:27] doctrinal messages
[2:32:29] that have gone on
[2:32:31] misrepresenting the message the message
[2:32:33] misrepresented mispreached
[2:32:36] christ misrepresented and then sometimes
[2:32:39] the people become more complicated
[2:32:43] [Music]
[2:32:45] but if we point the people to the real
[2:32:48] person of influence
[2:32:51] the ultimate voice
[2:32:53] until they and him become one
[2:32:57] and then their voice is not just working
[2:32:59] in the garden but they are
[2:33:02] the tabernacle of the body they
[2:33:05] the temple that is the voice is walking
[2:33:08] in
[2:33:12] that is the thunder that shakes the
[2:33:14] devil that is the thunder that they
[2:33:16] never cannot stand and as the church
[2:33:18] that's going to be triumphant
[2:33:24] blessed be the name of the lord
[2:33:31] so all along people have been
[2:33:34] keeping
[2:33:36] engraving tools
[2:33:41] at the back side of their mind
[2:33:44] it was there
[2:33:47] time will come we shall pick this pick
[2:33:49] this pick this pick ideas pick ideas
[2:33:53] what people want to hear what they don't
[2:33:55] want to hear
[2:33:56] the feelings of the people and what they
[2:33:58] want and then we shall make them
[2:34:00] something a package of the good they
[2:34:02] want
[2:34:05] [Music]
[2:34:07] glory to god
[2:34:08] may god bless you brother steven keep
[2:34:10] pressing on man
[2:34:12] we are here to preach jesus christ to
[2:34:15] the end
[2:34:16] the truth to the end
[2:34:20] and that's why paul says i was not
[2:34:22] disobedient to the heavenly vision
[2:34:26] in other words i was ready to disobey
[2:34:28] every man
[2:34:31] i was ready to lose every friend
[2:34:35] but i will never disobey the heavenly
[2:34:39] voice the heavenly vision what i heard
[2:34:42] from heaven no
[2:34:45] and he was testifying before a king or
[2:34:48] king agrippa i was not disobedient
[2:34:51] that's why i'm suffering that's why i'm
[2:34:54] unpopular that's why i'm hated that's
[2:34:56] why i'm persecuted but i'm not ashamed
[2:34:59] of it because i heard from heaven
[2:35:05] i heard it from heaven
[2:35:08] and that's why there is corruption as
[2:35:10] one you know moving quickly from him
[2:35:14] that called you
[2:35:16] unto the truth to another gospel which
[2:35:19] is not another
[2:35:21] they can't there can't be a duplicate of
[2:35:24] the message but just there are some men
[2:35:28] that trouble you
[2:35:29] [Music]
[2:35:32] trouble here
[2:35:35] you are trying to focus on going home
[2:35:37] they are coming with their ideas you are
[2:35:40] trying to focus on the rupture they are
[2:35:42] troubling you with that did you did you

[2:36:43] he says
[2:36:44] [Music]
[2:36:46] by the same sense

[2:37:25] you that part of god that comes into you
[2:37:28] and gives you dispersants by the same
[2:37:31] supersense god framed the world together
[2:37:33] with things which was not and did not
[2:37:36] appear he spoke his word and he believed
[2:37:39] his word and the world shook into
[2:37:41] existence
[2:37:42] god spoke the word and god believed the
[2:37:45] word and the world came into existence
[2:37:48] so today again
[2:37:50] as it was in the beginning so it is god
[2:37:52] will speak the word and god will believe
[2:37:54] his word and what he has spoken will

[2:38:13] get out of the reasonings of the five
[2:38:15] senses

[2:38:22] expressions
[2:38:22] [Music]
[2:38:24] glory
[2:38:26] and then he says the sixth sense

[2:39:03] memory takes me back to this all these
[2:39:06] ones are off
[2:39:08] [Music]
[2:39:09] let the sixth sense this persons of god
[2:39:12] come
[2:39:14] lord i'm waiting to surrender this five
[2:39:17] my own knowledge thoughts casting down
[2:39:20] all reasonings lord let thy word be true
[2:39:24] and every other man is worth a lie
[2:39:28] [Applause]
[2:39:30] every reasoning every doubt be cast out
[2:39:32] of my way let me walk by this person's
[2:39:35] the sense of the holy spirit
[2:39:40] glory and i love this quote where the
[2:39:43] prophet says they will love him they
[2:39:45] love
[2:39:47] love his and and
[2:39:49] and he
[2:39:50] will have his potentials they love his
[2:39:53] potentials and he will have his
[2:39:54] potentials for he is their head
[2:39:58] and they are his subjects subject to the
[2:40:01] head headship of christ was his now in
[2:40:04] other words
[2:40:05] that is the source
[2:40:08] of their influence
[2:40:12] the head is the sense of the source of
[2:40:14] the influence of the whole body
[2:40:17] and then he says oh not what a harmony
[2:40:22] jesus never did anything until he sinned
[2:40:25] of the father this is what we have to
[2:40:27] see
[2:40:29] not from english human being
[2:40:33] never compare these notes with the
[2:40:35] sanhedrin
[2:40:36] the pharisees the sadducees the
[2:40:38] herodians the ethnics the zealots the
[2:40:40] nazarites no
[2:40:44] what he saw the father
[2:40:49] harmony between god and christ
[2:40:51] so will the bride
[2:40:54] and he shows her his word of life
[2:40:57] he shows her
[2:40:59] and she receives it she never doubts it
[2:41:04] and for that reason nothing can harm her
[2:41:06] not even in death you believe in that
[2:41:11] not even death can harm you for if the
[2:41:13] seed be planted the water will raise it
[2:41:16] up again
[2:41:18] amen then i got a great big hallelujah
[2:41:21] here is the sacred
[2:41:23] the word is in the bride
[2:41:28] and the mind of christ
[2:41:30] to know
[2:41:31] what he wants done with the word
[2:41:37] and she does it in his name
[2:41:39] she has thus says the lord
[2:41:44] that's what she has
[2:41:46] that is her influence
[2:41:48] that says the lord
[2:41:50] and that says the lord comes through a
[2:41:51] prophet
[2:41:54] [Music]
[2:41:56] they do only his will amen i believe
[2:41:59] that
[2:42:00] no one can persuade them
[2:42:02] different
[2:42:08] doesn't matter what reputation
[2:42:13] how powerful
[2:42:15] how rich
[2:42:17] how influential
[2:42:19] [Applause]
[2:42:26] no one can persuade them different
[2:42:32] they have thus saying the lord oh they
[2:42:36] keep still
[2:42:39] and still doesn't just mean quiet
[2:42:45] but they stand still and see
[2:42:49] the glory of the lord and invading
[2:42:53] you shall not need to fight in this
[2:42:56] battle
[2:42:57] stand still
[2:42:59] and see the lord himself coming down the
[2:43:02] fight
[2:43:06] they have that say the lord oh they keep
[2:43:08] still
[2:43:09] then they will do the works of god
[2:43:12] for it is himself in them
[2:43:15] continuing his word to fulfill
[2:43:18] as he did complete in his days all
[2:43:22] things
[2:43:25] as he was here
[2:43:27] he did not complete all when he was here
[2:43:30] for it was not yet time
[2:43:36] [Music]
[2:43:37] so that's why
[2:43:41] what did the elijah commission elijah
[2:43:44] you shall do three things
[2:44:01] he did only one
[2:44:07] the two were done by
[2:44:09] elijah
[2:44:12] but it was his commission
[2:44:16] but when god was commissioning elijah
[2:44:19] elijah was going to ride the trail again
[2:44:22] in elisha
[2:44:23] [Music]
[2:44:28] and god
[2:44:30] included elijah
[2:44:33] in the commission that he gave elijah
[2:44:43] so
[2:44:45] that spirit that was in maracai 4 is not
[2:44:48] brother abraham that is the spirit of
[2:44:51] jesus christ and he is here
[2:44:55] to ride this trail once more
[2:44:59] and the devil cannot stop it
[2:45:01] saturn will not stop it
[2:45:07] this bride is going on
[2:45:09] this church is going on
[2:45:12] the minister of elisha is going on
[2:45:15] and the devil is not going to stop it
[2:45:18] glory be to god
[2:45:21] do you believe you are the candidate for
[2:45:24] the elijah ministry
[2:45:27] you believe
[2:45:28] that spirit is to be in you
[2:45:32] and he's here
[2:45:34] to vindicate that word
[2:45:37] to prove it
[2:45:41] may god bless you
[2:45:45] [Applause]
[2:45:52] hallelujah
[2:45:53] [Applause]
[2:45:55] we are going to pray
[2:45:57] and if you want to be remembered in this
[2:45:59] prayer
[2:46:01] friend
[2:46:03] what a time what a challenge that we are
[2:46:06] living in as we bow our heads and close
[2:46:08] our eyes
[2:46:11] just think
[2:46:13] about what happened in eden
[2:46:16] and you know that's always been the
[2:46:17] trick of the devil throughout
[2:46:22] saturn wanting the people to malign and
[2:46:25] to be little
[2:46:27] the messenger of the day and even saying
[2:46:30] this man moses
[2:46:33] coming up with their own idols
[2:46:39] and having a hybrid religion
[2:46:43] where they cannot touch themselves the
[2:46:45] message
[2:46:46] but they are not genuine message
[2:46:47] believers
[2:46:49] that that should not be your condition
[2:46:51] brother that should not be your
[2:46:52] condition sister
[2:46:54] and never be that person you will say
[2:46:57] lord
[2:46:58] i got lost i broke your word i failed to
[2:47:01] come to perfection
[2:47:03] because of the wife you gave me
[2:47:05] because of the husband you gave me
[2:47:08] because of the children you gave me
[2:47:10] because of the church you gave me or
[2:47:12] because of the pastor you gave me
[2:47:14] that should not be your excuse
[2:47:17] we should live beyond the level of
[2:47:19] excuses
[2:47:22] and say lord i heard from heaven
[2:47:25] i have no excuse
[2:47:28] i have heard and i know
[2:47:31] this is the truth
[2:47:33] help me lord to
[2:47:35] be exactly what you want me to be
[2:47:39] without any excuse
[2:47:42] because i heard from you
[2:47:44] [Music]
[2:47:47] and we are going to pray
[2:47:48] if you want to be remembered in prayer
[2:47:50] just lift up your hand
[2:47:52] lord jesus
[2:47:54] in the name of jesus christ

[2:48:00] time we are seeing these things lord
[2:48:05] how these spirits are getting manifested
[2:48:07] before us
[2:48:09] and there is a challenge
[2:48:12] to the ministry
[2:48:15] the message
[2:48:17] being maligned belittled abused
[2:48:22] by scientific minds
[2:48:24] reasoning
[2:48:25] [Music]
[2:48:27] lord we are here have mercy upon us help
[2:48:31] us
[2:48:33] that we shall live by the supersense
[2:48:36] the sixth sense
[2:48:38] the sense of faith

[2:48:43] to know that lord is you to reveal unto
[2:48:46] us
[2:48:47] what we are supposed to be
[2:48:50] and never never never should we give the
[2:48:53] enemy room
[2:48:54] to sow the seeds of discrepancy
[2:48:59] lord that while men slept
[2:49:01] [Music]
[2:49:02] should not happen again
[2:49:04] may we always be on our god
[2:49:08] watchful
[2:49:09] may we not be
[2:49:10] among those who slept

[2:49:15] seeds
[2:49:16] of discreet person

[2:49:34] help us know that
[2:49:36] every bit of what's required to be in us
[2:49:40] lord will be in us
[2:49:42] and anything that is not
[2:49:44] supposed to be in us
[2:49:47] should not be in us
[2:49:49] like you say through yourself and a
[2:49:51] prophet
[2:49:52] what is death
[2:49:53] death is anything which is not the word
[2:49:55] of god
[2:49:56] and what's life
[2:49:58] life is the word
[2:50:00] so help us lord

[2:50:58] we don't serve a god that we keep
[2:51:00] defending that he exists

[2:51:05] always reveals himself and vindicates
[2:51:07] his word

[3:08:37] burden
[3:08:38] he created the fishes and the dolphin
[3:08:41] and uh
[3:08:43] and the shark does a shark look like god
[3:08:46] but on the sixth day
[3:08:50] he created something
[3:08:52] that looked exactly like him
[3:08:55] because they created man
[3:08:58] in his own image and in his own likeness
[3:09:03] so if you don't know how god is
[3:09:07] look at me
[3:09:13] amen
[3:09:14] when you see god god is a human being
[3:09:18] he looks like man
[3:09:19] one day moses asked a question and moses
[3:09:22] said i talked to this fire for a long
[3:09:24] time and this fire is talking like a
[3:09:27] human being
[3:09:29] it is not talking like an animal because
[3:09:31] animals do not talk
[3:09:33] except if the lord opened a way for an
[3:09:36] animal to talk like belem
[3:09:38] but animals don't talk they talk in
[3:09:41] cartoons
[3:09:45] everybody okay so far
[3:09:46] everybody okay animal don't talk amen
[3:09:50] and moses said lord at least let me see
[3:09:52] who's talking
[3:09:54] when he showed moses he was like the
[3:09:56] back of all a donkey
[3:09:59] an elephant
[3:10:00] in the back of water
[3:10:02] because man was created in the image and
[3:10:06] in the likeness of
[3:10:08] in other words when god created man in
[3:10:10] the sixth day that was the top
[3:10:16] that was the summit
[3:10:18] that was the climax
[3:10:20] that was the highest level
[3:10:23] that's why god could rest because
[3:10:26] somebody looked like him
[3:10:28] he can take the earth and give it to man
[3:10:32] so that man can lead the earth
[3:10:35] because man was a complete reflection of
[3:10:38] god
[3:10:39] anybody here so on the seventh day if
[3:10:43] this is the top
[3:10:44] what else do you do on the seventh day
[3:10:48] so what do you have to do
[3:10:52] so the answer to rest is what because of
[3:10:55] the labels that happen in the other six
[3:10:57] day
[3:10:59] so when you go to the seventh day it's
[3:11:02] silence
[3:11:04] you say seven days
[3:11:06] what happened in your day nothing
[3:11:10] what happened in your day god rested
[3:11:13] what does it mean god rested
[3:11:15] god rested because he was working
[3:11:19] anybody here
[3:11:21] so to understand the seventh day the
[3:11:23] seventh day tells you that there was
[3:11:25] work before me
[3:11:27] so it's the seventh day that i have the
[3:11:30] answer to the other six days
[3:11:33] if god never rested you would never
[3:11:36] understand he was working
[3:11:38] so you need to go to the rest to
[3:11:40] understand the working
[3:11:43] you need to go to the that's why when
[3:11:45] they open the seventh seal quiet
[3:11:50] because on the first year he unfolded
[3:11:52] things
[3:11:53] the second seal he unfolded thing the
[3:11:56] third seals he unfolded him the fourth
[3:11:58] seal he unfolded the fifth seal he
[3:12:01] unfolded when he reached the seventh
[3:12:04] year he unfolded even the trumpets
[3:12:07] [Applause]
[3:12:12] and when you finish you got to question
[3:12:15] and answer
[3:12:16] because he already finished everything
[3:12:23] anybody okay
[3:12:25] anybody okay that's why when brother
[3:12:27] branham wanted to preach the trumpet
[3:12:30] god said no no no no no go in the six
[3:12:32] cell
[3:12:33] you already preached the trumpet
[3:12:36] so when you look at the sick seal it
[3:12:38] looks like it doesn't help trump and the
[3:12:39] trumpeter there
[3:12:43] i'm gonna help you up i know somebody
[3:12:45] still struggling
[3:12:48] i know brother branham said the way
[3:12:51] the scroll was written
[3:12:54] now you're gonna understand amen
[3:12:57] they take one and they roll it this way
[3:13:01] and the ceiling
[3:13:03] and the the one they seal the roll the
[3:13:05] second one on top of it
[3:13:07] and the seal
[3:13:09] and then they roll the third one on top
[3:13:12] and the seal so let's start number one
[3:13:14] is rolled
[3:13:16] is sealed
[3:13:17] number two is rolled it's healed number
[3:13:20] three is rolled
[3:13:21] it's here number four is raw it's water
[3:13:24] number five
[3:13:26] number six
[3:13:27] and number seven
[3:13:30] is sale right
[3:13:32] so how can you read number one if seven
[3:13:34] is locking everything
[3:13:37] [Applause]
[3:13:39] in your okay now you cannot read number
[3:13:41] one
[3:13:42] number two number three number four
[3:13:45] number seven because they all are
[3:13:47] wrapped up in the seven so when you
[3:13:49] break the seventh one
[3:13:56] everybody okay so once you break the
[3:13:58] seventh here he automatically open the
[3:14:01] seat up and the fifth up in the fourth
[3:14:04] all the way the whole book is now
[3:14:07] any question
[3:14:15] in other words you need to go back to
[3:14:16] this message and listen more
[3:14:19] [Laughter]
[3:14:22] amen
[3:14:23] you need to go back to the message and
[3:14:25] listen more and you're going to see
[3:14:26] there's more stuff that was spoken there
[3:14:28] but it's so deep
[3:14:32] i'm trying to help you get the package
[3:14:34] so you can go home
[3:14:37] israel left egypt which is the world
[3:14:40] and they went into the wilderness in the
[3:14:42] middle
[3:14:43] amen then it's the promised land
[3:14:46] the people that left moses here
[3:14:49] lost the promised land
[3:14:51] and they lost egypt
[3:14:55] everybody okay
[3:14:57] they could never go back again to egypt
[3:15:01] they cannot go to the promised land
[3:15:03] they're dying in the wilderness amen
[3:15:06] so don't expect the leaders of those
[3:15:09] that left the message to go totally
[3:15:12] worldly
[3:15:14] they cannot
[3:15:16] they will try to wear
[3:15:18] stuff look like message believer but
[3:15:20] they rejected the message
[3:15:22] because they cannot go totally in egypt
[3:15:25] because what they already received would
[3:15:27] not allow them to go back
[3:15:30] but they cannot progress again to the
[3:15:32] promised land they are stuck right there
[3:15:35] make sense now
[3:15:36] so make sure in your ears you don't have
[3:15:39] a potential for idolatry
[3:15:44] if you have it it's time to break it
[3:15:47] not to make a golden calf
[3:15:50] anybody here remove all potential for
[3:15:53] idolatry because down the road there was
[3:15:55] somebody will come and stop picking it
[3:15:57] up and calling you every day or calling
[3:16:00] your wife
[3:16:01] what do you think about the message what
[3:16:03] do you think about hey hey hey those
[3:16:05] questions were there all along why you
[3:16:07] didn't answer why you didn't go ask
[3:16:09] brother branham when he was alive
[3:16:14] everybody
[3:16:15] find how many record rockets you have to
[3:16:18] shoot to come up with the with the
[3:16:20] picture of huffman
[3:16:23] you will continue to shoot until hell is
[3:16:26] destroyed
[3:16:27] and no rocket can produce that
[3:16:30] and that matches this one
[3:16:33] how can you keep this one without that
[3:16:35] one
[3:16:36] this one was spoken first and he was
[3:16:39] joined by men but that one he was joined
[3:16:42] by god and this one vindicate that this
[3:16:45] one was correct
[3:16:48] [Music]
[3:16:51] amen
[3:16:52] there is nothing for you to fight
[3:16:54] against the truth
[3:16:56] all you can do is work for the truth
[3:16:58] so god richly bless you continue to
[3:17:01] ruminate and to chew and may god
[3:17:03] continue to work in his church brother
