[0:05] doesn't work
[0:08] who told you you are the failure
[0:12] is that a god's language
[0:28] when you
[1:08] death and life are in the power of the
[1:10] tongue
[1:15] and they beloved shall eat the fruit
[1:17] thereof
[1:19] so it's clear you heard it
[1:23] god send you to school
[1:37] no matter where you prayed and god
[1:40] answer your prayer and send you there
[1:44] and then if you go to that place and you
[1:47] find
[1:47] an opposition and you find difficulty
[1:52] maybe in your wedding
[1:53] maybe at your work or wherever god
[1:55] pleases you
[1:58] why not go back to the god that gave you
[2:01] the marriage
[2:03] god is in you his word is in your
[2:20] and if you confess bad things death will
[2:22] happen
[2:23] amen amen god put
[2:26] everything upon your own wrapper
[2:31] so why don't you delight in only
[2:34] confessing
[2:35] that which is good amen amen
[2:41] god spoke in his word that we are gods
[2:47] and brother read
[3:00] when someone is sick the elders have the
[3:02] ability to pray and anoint the person we
[3:05] follow
[3:07] but no matter your condition
[3:12] god doesn't have a
[3:15] favoritism amen amen
[3:21] everybody that confessed his name
[3:25] he gave them the power to become sons of
[3:29] god
[3:44] first john yeah i think
[3:48] first john chapter one angel
[3:52] first john chapter one
[3:57] no jean silva
[4:13] but as many as received him i set him
[4:17] quiet
[4:18] to them he gave power
[4:23] to become the sons of god even to them
[4:26] that believe on his name
[4:29] which were born not the son not of blood
[4:35] nor of the will of flesh
[4:39] know of the will of man of god
[4:42] amen amen you see
[4:45] you snot is here
[4:50] god gave you the ability to become his
[4:53] son
[4:54] or his daughter not
[4:57] by the will of your father or your
[4:59] mother
[5:02] that's the reason why
[5:07] that's why he spoke to jeremiah he said
[5:09] before you were conceived
[5:11] in your mother's womb
[5:14] i already know you see as we are here
[5:18] tonight
[5:20] god already knew us prior to the
[5:23] foundation of the world
[5:28] but why do you always pay attention to
[5:30] what the world
[5:31] is saying the world did not create you
[5:36] you have a creator
[5:40] you have a garden
[5:43] when the world is seeking after god
[5:47] they must find that god in you
[5:51] [Applause]
[6:00] let that people see jesus through your
[6:04] behavior
[6:15] to see jesus christ through your immune
[6:18] humility
[6:28] we want to see jesus christ in you
[6:30] triumphing in a victorious christ
[6:36] [Music]
[6:45] we found that when peter was down below
[6:50] they never knew what happened between
[6:52] jesus and moses
[6:55] so to be partaker of what happened over
[6:58] there
[6:59] you must come higher
[7:04] [Applause]
[7:12] because in you you are carrying the name
[7:14] of jesus
[7:17] because you are carrying the name of god
[7:21] you can remember david
[7:23] [Music]
[7:25] there was a philistine
[7:43] bear and the lion remember
[7:47] so the man the same god that gave me
[7:49] that victory
[7:52] he's also able to give me the victory
[7:56] tonight
[7:59] and tonight god is able to give you
[8:01] victory to your problem
[8:06] that situation that i have been longing
[8:08] for so
[8:09] staying for so long
[8:12] [Applause]
[8:31] let me see if elijah was a big
[8:34] uh someone coming from a different world
[8:38] than where
[8:38] we
[8:51] james 5 17.
[9:03] as we are oh my god
[9:21] by the space of three years and six
[9:23] months amen
[9:25] amen the bible says
[9:29] the bible is comparing us to elijah
[9:34] so the same way you were born
[9:38] elijah was born the same way
[9:42] but when he faced the issue
[9:46] he was taking his personal problem
[9:49] seriously
[9:50] and he was praying earnestly
[9:53] so that the solution can happen
[9:57] the problem with the church tonight
[10:00] your problem tonight um
[10:30] you are not like everybody else deity
[10:33] lives in you
[10:36] they still live in you
[10:44] jesus
[10:46] the fullness of the godhead badly amen
[10:49] amen
[10:54] because god created all things

[11:21] [Music]
[11:26] amen
[11:52] let me read it let me read it
[12:01] to see what did god do to man after he
[12:04] created him
[12:04] amen amen amen
[12:20] when god created all things
[12:26] he brought everything to men amen
[12:36] amen
[12:45] okay genesis 2 19 20.
[12:52] amen amen amen
[12:59] and out of the ground the lord god
[13:02] formed
[13:04] every beast
[13:47] but for adam there was not found and
[13:49] helped me for him
[13:52] i just told you that man was a partner
[13:56] of god not a servant
[14:00] as we
[14:01] [Applause]
[14:06] [Applause]
[14:10] god never came back and created
[14:12] something else
[14:15] he brought everything that he created
[14:18] and presented that to adam
[14:20] to see what will adam do with it
[14:24] because he created men to his own image
[14:29] you are created to the image of god
[14:35] so how can you explain
[14:40] that adam could sit and start with
[14:52] for you to give a name to a creature
[14:58] you must know your science pretty good
[15:04] you must know the characteristic of the
[15:07] beast or the
[15:11] to creature this fish from that fish
[15:15] based on their characteristics
[15:18] do you understand the level adam was
[15:21] listening

[15:31] that's the deity i'm speaking about
[15:35] that deity dwells in you
[15:52] every creature and god only
[15:56] posed his approval god never

[41:23] and i thought the power of the man's
[41:25] prayer do i believe that it was god's
[41:26] will
[41:27] for those children to die just because
[41:29] they were making fun of a prophet
[41:31] god could have had grace on those
[41:36] [Music]

[41:48] speak the word over my situation but we
[41:50] pray for god's will
[41:52] but it doesn't mean we have to struggle
[41:54] with sickness we can be
[41:56] told by many doctors we have cancer and
[41:58] we can say lord we pray for your will
[42:00] but we don't
[42:03] [Music]
[42:12] to fight what any doctrine they said so
[42:15] we speak the word
[42:16] we hold to it we progress and sooner or
[42:19] later we'll confess
[42:20] when we put that to confess even if it
[42:22] takes us to our grave
[42:24] we know that we still need the victory
[42:26] no matter what happens we still get the
[42:28] victory
[42:29] god's over that thing whatever it is
[42:31] sickness struggle
[42:32] you speak the word you claim it and god
[42:35] will handle it put it in his hands let
[42:37] go and let god
