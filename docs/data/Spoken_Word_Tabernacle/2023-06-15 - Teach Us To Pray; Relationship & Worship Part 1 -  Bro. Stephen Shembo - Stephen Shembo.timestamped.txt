[42:36] brother Caleb just give me a little bit
[42:38] and to make sure I can hear myself it's
[42:42] a church prayer not the church should be
[42:45] full
[42:47] amen
[42:48] the church should be full amen oh my I
[42:52] believe everybody is up to date with the

[42:56] glory to God glory glory hallelujah amen
[43:00] continue to read your books your Cod
[43:02] your church age is and everything and
[43:05] just a reminder Saturday at 2 30 right
[43:09] you already know where it is Young
[43:11] sisters so we meet at the venue for the
[43:14] young Sisters Meeting and on June the
[43:17] 24th Lord's willing that's a question
[43:20] and answer if somebody sent me a message
[43:23] or a text or something just be patient
[43:26] with me uh have been attacked left and
[43:31] right by hell
[43:33] amen but we got the victory I'm here
[43:37] amen
[43:39] I was almost at the brink of saying
[43:42] maybe brother Kelly go ahead and pick
[43:44] this up and move on so I sent them a
[43:46] text today I say the Deacon I say you
[43:49] pray for me and after 15 minutes things
[43:51] begin to change after both of them
[43:53] responded so
[43:55] I know the devil is mad
[43:57] and I'm not happy either
[44:00] so we're pressing on and everything will
[44:04] be okay standing here it's by the grace
[44:06] of God if you notice my wife is probably
[44:08] streaming she's not here so you know
[44:10] what I have been going through it's it's
[44:12] heavy from hell and it comes in a
[44:16] different way but I know what he's
[44:17] looking after and we know how to
[44:20] maneuver out of this thing amen so we
[44:23] got the victory we're here tonight by
[44:25] God's grace amen let's go to Second
[44:27] Chronicles chapter seven I'm using my uh
[44:31] question and answer Bible so
[44:35] I don't have the court uh the slide line
[44:38] up but thank God brother Caleb tried to
[44:41] manage to put everything on the on the
[44:44] PowerPoint so so that you can follow me
[44:47] it's not going to be in order so I will
[44:49] be jumping left and right just like we
[44:52] did the music part one part two and part
[44:55] three so we will approach this as a
[44:58] Sunday school lesson as a teaching amen
[45:02] I don't know if 30 minutes is enough to
[45:06] cover prayer pray is a big and huge
[45:09] subject amen
[45:11] second Chronicle chapter 7 verse 14. I
[45:17] hope those that are not here are
[45:18] streaming
[45:22] because it was announced
[45:25] for a long time
[45:32] and I even have a quote whenever you see
[45:34] you want to pray and the devil is
[45:37] blocking you it's a signal that there is
[45:40] a blessing
[45:44] so if you try to make it to church in
[45:47] prayer night and something block you
[45:48] just know they was blocking you for
[45:52] a blessing amen
[45:54] second Chronicle chapter 7 verse 14 the
[45:59] Bible says amen
[46:03] If my people
[46:06] not anybody
[46:10] do you see why it's hard for me to
[46:12] preach this in 30 minutes
[46:16] right if my people
[46:19] so you gotta be a people of love
[46:22] amen
[46:24] it's not everybody
[46:26] it is my people
[46:28] in other words it's concerning God's
[46:32] people
[46:35] amen
[46:37] If my people
[46:39] which are called
[46:41] by my
[46:43] you might be seated
[46:45] so those people
[46:48] don't carry their name
[46:51] amen amen
[46:54] amen
[46:56] these people do not carry their name
[47:01] they don't call them brother Isaac
[47:04] they don't call these people Brother
[47:05] David
[47:07] they don't call them brother polycarp
[47:09] Junior they call those people by the
[47:12] name of God and we know the name of God
[47:15] is Jesus Christ everybody okay so if the
[47:20] people that are Jesus
[47:22] amen amen this was the Old Testament now
[47:26] the opening of the seals is opening
[47:28] something different
[47:30] so you preach with me okay or you teach
[47:32] with me okay
[47:34] so these people are not just people
[47:37] they are the people of God
[47:41] and they don't call them the people of
[47:43] God they have a name

[49:41] Branham say it's a word for repentance
[49:44] amen amen amen those people are humbling
[49:50] themselves they are praying seeking God
[49:53] Amen and God is also adding a repentance
[49:59] amen meaning something did some somebody

[50:30] God say
[50:32] I will hear from where
[50:34] so God is Not on Earth
[50:40] you will understand why I'm saying this
[50:43] so somebody is on Earth and somebody
[50:46] else is in heaven
[50:48] everybody okay
[50:50] so you're not in the same location
[50:55] are we okay
[50:57] they are
[50:58] these people is on Earth
[51:02] amen amen and God is in heaven
[51:10] glory to God
[51:12] so on the earth we got the people of God
[51:17] we are the people of God right we are
[51:20] never here right call by his name
[51:23] amen the name is Jesus Christ
[51:26] and for you to be called Jesus Christ
[51:27] you must be part of the Bride
[51:31] we okay now
[51:35] amen these people are on earth
[51:38] and In Heaven There is Hope
[51:42] amen so God say if these people
[51:46] humble themselves
[51:48] praying
[51:49] seek me repent turn from their ways I
[51:54] will hear not from the Earth
[51:56] I'm gonna hear from where
[52:00] amen so the connection
[52:05] Between Heaven and Earth
[52:11] is what
[52:19] everybody okay everybody okay the
[52:23] communication between Heaven and Earth
[52:25] is water
[52:25] [Music]
[52:28] we can even stop right here
[52:54] everybody okay
[52:56] everybody okay if you're in trouble
[53:01] if you need a number that you don't know
[53:07] everybody okay
[53:11] then I will hear from heaven
[53:15] and we'll do what
[53:17] forgive their sin and heal the water so
[53:21] somebody here is in trouble
[53:26] they need a healing
[53:27] [Music]
[53:29] okay these people are in trouble
[53:33] and they need a healing
[53:35] and the healing not of their body
[53:39] foreign
[53:40] amen
[53:43] amen but they need to do this
[53:45] and whoever is over there will answer
[53:48] them
[53:49] amen
[53:51] so the prayer is not complete
[53:55] if this man do not answer
[54:04] let's go to First Timothy chapter 2.
[54:10] amen
[54:13] Lord help me brother Robert you let me
[54:15] know when it's 45 minutes or something
[54:22] I gave a 15-minute Grace
[54:25] second tip First Timothy chapter 2.
[54:29] verse 8 if you dare you can say Amen
[54:38] pages are still turning
[54:42] I will try to keep this as a teaching
[54:46] I will therefore
[54:50] in other board Paul preferred
[54:53] I will therefore
[54:56] that man do what
[55:00] pray well
[55:03] so prayer should be way
[55:09] you pray in the bathroom
[55:14] you pray in the kitchen
[55:17] you pray in your car
[55:20] you pray in your bedroom
[55:22] you pray in Walmart
[55:32] Paul wants us to pray well
[55:35] so this thing that we're trying to talk
[55:38] about is available everywhere
[55:47] amen
[55:48] even at work
[55:51] lifting up holy hands
[55:54] without
[55:56] and water
[55:57] so if you want to pray you cannot be
[56:00] upset
[56:01] [Applause]
[56:06] oh Lord have mercy
[56:09] is my Bible I'm using this King James
[56:12] Bible
[56:13] okay is it different
[56:15] [Music]
[56:19] so you cannot Pray when you are upset
[56:25] amen
[56:29] and the second thing is you cannot pray
[56:32] where
[56:37] amen
[56:39] if you doubt
[56:41] why are you praying then
[56:43] and I'm gonna show you
[56:45] if you're already doubting
[56:47] don't waste your time
[56:50] amen if your husband got you mad or your
[56:54] wife got you mad or your children got
[56:57] you mad you need to cool down
[57:02] everybody okay everybody okay
[57:06] you cannot Pray when you are upset
[57:10] I'm already teaching you prayer amen
[57:14] one day there was a prophet who was
[57:16] upset
[57:19] his name is Elisha amen they brought him
[57:23] a case and because of what happened with
[57:26] the case and Jezebel he got upset to the
[57:30] man that was talking to him amen now
[57:33] they needed a solution and the man was a
[57:35] prophet not because of his attitude
[57:40] everybody okay there was no way for him
[57:43] to enter into prayer
[57:45] do you know what he did
[57:47] he called for a song leader
[57:51] Amen to play First music and when music
[57:55] came
[57:57] and changed the atmosphere amen
[58:00] then the spirit of the Lord was able to
[58:03] come and the men could receive a
[58:06] solution you don't pray when you're
[58:08] upset
[58:12] everybody okay so if you see something
[58:14] that is trying to upset you
[58:19] closer to your prayer time
[58:22] you need to be careful and try to avoid
[58:24] it
[58:25] because your state is important
[58:29] before you pray before you pray you must
[58:33] have a complete a a a a same
[58:37] a calm a good atmosphere
[58:46] sometimes you get into a house
[58:48] and you see children doing things to
[58:50] upset you if you're not spiritual enough
[58:53] you will begin to get upset because you
[58:57] don't understand that the devil is
[58:59] working with your children I have the
[59:00] quote where they were doing that for
[59:02] brother Branham
[59:04] amen and after you get upset then you're
[59:08] not going to be able to go pray
[59:12] you don't pray when you're upset
[59:15] you don't pray when you doubting
[59:20] everybody okay
[59:22] let's go to James chapter 5.
[59:29] I don't know if I'm teaching or
[59:31] preaching it's hard to tell
[59:33] amen
[59:35] God's people call by his name humble
[59:38] Earth and Heaven very important if I can
[59:40] only touch that that will be good
[59:43] let's go to James Chapter Five if you're
[59:45] there you can say Amen
[59:47] oh God glory to God
[59:50] verse 14.
[59:52] is any
[59:54] among you
[59:56] let him call the Elder of the church
[59:59] and let them do water
[1:00:01] so solution to sickness is water
[1:00:04] pray over him anointing him with oil in
[1:00:08] the name of the Lord
[1:00:10] and the prayer of water so you can pray
[1:00:14] without faith
[1:00:18] that's why Paul said do not pray
[1:00:21] doubting
[1:00:24] amen
[1:00:26] I will show you those things as I'm
[1:00:28] moving it's different than the prayer of
[1:00:32] faith
[1:00:33] it's not just praying
[1:00:36] amen it's the prayer of
[1:00:40] in his prayer with
[1:00:46] amen
[1:00:48] and the prayer of faith shall save the
[1:00:50] sick and the Lord shall raise him up if
[1:00:54] he has committed sin they shall be
[1:00:56] forgiven him confess your fault one to
[1:00:59] another and pray one for another that
[1:01:03] you may be healed the effects of fervent
[1:01:07] prayer
[1:01:10] so this prayer is not just prayer it is
[1:01:14] perfect
[1:01:16] amen there is an emotion
[1:01:23] there is a difference between a prayer
[1:01:28] with emotion and a prayer that is dry
[1:01:38] everybody okay
[1:01:40] we have a fervent prayer
[1:01:45] and I'm using the word emotion
[1:01:50] amen
[1:01:52] I know when we talk about prayer all we
[1:01:55] see is two hours five hours seven hours
[1:01:58] please let that alone first okay let's
[1:02:02] go like from kindergarten okay
[1:02:04] okay until we get to your five hours
[1:02:07] because you want to know how to you how
[1:02:09] you can pray seven hours
[1:02:13] you can go seven hours and come out to
[1:02:15] zero
[1:02:17] and somebody enter five minutes and come
[1:02:20] up with an answer
[1:02:25] amen
[1:02:29] the effects of prayer fervent prayer of
[1:02:32] a water
[1:02:36] not of a man
[1:02:38] a man that is how
[1:02:41] how can you be righteous
[1:02:45] because the Bible say Christ is our
[1:02:48] so that's why it's important to be
[1:02:50] called in his
[1:02:55] so when you are presenting before God
[1:02:57] you're not presenting you
[1:03:00] the one that is approaching God is Jesus
[1:03:03] Christ
[1:03:07] okay
[1:03:10] Elias was a man subject to like passion
[1:03:14] as we in other words their lies that you
[1:03:17] heard is not different than you
[1:03:19] he was eating like you he was a human
[1:03:21] like you talking like you doing things
[1:03:23] like you
[1:03:24] and he pray how
[1:03:34] earnestly amen
[1:03:37] that
[1:03:38] Iman naturally
[1:03:41] and he went not on the Earth by the
[1:03:44] space of three years and water
[1:03:47] and he prayed again
[1:03:49] another way he looks like Elijah have
[1:03:52] something that he can play with prayer
[1:03:54] open close open close and he works for
[1:03:58] him
[1:04:00] but but what James is saying is he was
[1:04:03] not a supernatural being like an angel
[1:04:05] he was a human
[1:04:07] but that human could talk and close
[1:04:09] heaven
[1:04:11] and he talked in the open again so you
[1:04:13] can close the entire country's Heaven
[1:04:15] one man can do that when that one man
[1:04:18] can also open not five men not a group
[1:04:20] of men not a whole church just one
[1:04:22] person
[1:04:26] amen
[1:04:27] and he pray again and they have indeed
[1:04:29] what gave rain and the Earth brought
[1:04:32] forth her fruit
[1:04:34] so the power to open to close was in the
[1:04:37] hand of a man in the Old Testament
[1:04:40] who knew how to pray
[1:04:44] let's pray Heavenly Father
[1:04:47] Lord we are approaching you humbly
[1:04:49] tonight
[1:04:51] father once again thanking you for your
[1:04:53] grace for your love and your mercy for
[1:04:56] me to be standing here it is nothing but
[1:04:58] the grace of God and your mercy Lord may
[1:05:02] you help us tonight as we're talking
[1:05:04] about this subject may you move me
[1:05:06] completely out of the way may you remove
[1:05:08] every trouble that the devil have thrown
[1:05:12] on your children on their Pathway to
[1:05:15] trouble them to weary them to make them
[1:05:18] tired but father May the strength from
[1:05:21] the Holy Spirit come tonight and may you
[1:05:23] speak to us and help us catch the things
[1:05:26] that belongs to us for the betterment of
[1:05:29] our families of Our Lives of our church
[1:05:32] of our of your kingdom in the name of
[1:05:35] Jesus Christ amen
[1:05:39] my subject tonight is teach us
[1:05:44] to pray
[1:05:47] my subject to none is teach us
[1:05:50] to pray
[1:05:51] everybody okay
[1:05:53] I will be reading brother Branham back
[1:05:55] and forth amen
[1:05:58] why is this prayer
[1:06:01] subject
[1:06:02] such a huge big subject why is he good
[1:06:06] amen
[1:06:07] Brother Brad I'm saying in the message
[1:06:09] faith brother Caleb the first uh quote
[1:06:13] in paragraph five brother Branham say
[1:06:16] Prayer Changes Things
[1:06:22] prayer changes death to life
[1:06:28] he said prayer changes sickness to
[1:06:31] health
[1:06:34] I'm reading it's on the board right
[1:06:37] uh
[1:06:39] please give brother Benjamin the
[1:06:41] microphone come over here
[1:06:43] so we can do this job together
[1:06:45] amen
[1:06:46] let me get some amen coming up left and
[1:06:49] right amen
[1:06:51] glory to God
[1:06:53] yes sir please be to the name of the
[1:06:56] Lord
[1:06:56] brother Branham say prayer changes
[1:07:00] sickness to health that
[1:07:03] he changes Sinners to Center
[1:07:06] [Music]
[1:07:07] so if you want to change a deaf
[1:07:10] situation into a life you need prayer
[1:07:13] [Applause]
[1:07:14] if you want to remove sickness into
[1:07:17] Health you need prayer
[1:07:19] in other words prayer is something that
[1:07:23] you can connect to something bad and
[1:07:25] prayer will change it into something
[1:07:27] good
[1:07:28] [Applause]
[1:07:30] everybody okay
[1:07:31] brother Branham say you may last too
[1:07:35] much
[1:07:36] you may shout too much
[1:07:39] you may eat too much but you shall never
[1:07:43] pray too much because where do we pray
[1:07:46] everywhere
[1:07:48] [Music]
[1:07:48] [Applause]
[1:07:51] in other words you can never reach a
[1:07:54] level in your life that you feel like
[1:07:56] you're comfortable with praying
[1:08:01] prayer is something you need every day
[1:08:05] it is something you need every time
[1:08:07] [Music]
[1:08:08] [Applause]
[1:08:11] I know when we talk about prayer what we
[1:08:15] have a tendency is to go kneel and do
[1:08:17] this that's where we're missing how are
[1:08:20] you gonna kneel if you are driving your
[1:08:22] car
[1:08:26] how are you gonna near if you're working
[1:08:28] on your job
[1:08:30] how am I gonna kneel if I'm pulling a
[1:08:33] tooth
[1:08:35] how are you gonna kneel if you cooking
[1:08:39] but you can pray cooking
[1:08:42] you can pray pulling a tooth amen you
[1:08:45] can play drops in your car
[1:08:46] [Music]
[1:08:53] um
[1:08:54] everybody okay
[1:08:55] brother Branham said the Bible say I
[1:08:58] will that man pray everywhere lifting up
[1:09:02] holy hand so you shall never be able to
[1:09:06] pray too much
[1:09:10] so prayer will never have a summit
[1:09:14] you will not have a top level where you
[1:09:16] wish you say now I pray too much even if
[1:09:20] you pray now you can continue to pray
[1:09:24] amen prayer Prayer Changes Things
[1:09:28] amen glory be to the name of the Lord
[1:09:32] let me follow my GPS here
[1:09:35] why are we talking about prayer in the
[1:09:37] church
[1:09:38] brother Caleb where he said the burden
[1:09:40] for prayer
[1:09:42] it's on the second page brother Branham
[1:09:44] say
[1:09:45] I rather have a church
[1:09:48] that had such a burden on their heart
[1:09:51] for prayer
[1:09:52] that they just stay at this Altar and
[1:09:56] will be there day and night
[1:10:00] and everything else
[1:10:02] and in their house
[1:10:04] was constantly in prayer and humble
[1:10:08] so you pray in your house and you pray
[1:10:11] in the church but brother Branham is
[1:10:14] talking about humble because the
[1:10:16] scripture that we read say if my people
[1:10:18] do water
[1:10:21] [Music]
[1:10:23] and trying to get the people to God and
[1:10:27] making calls at the hospital and
[1:10:29] visiting the sick and trying to get the
[1:10:31] people to come to church and do right I
[1:10:34] rather have that
[1:10:36] all the other put together although the
[1:10:39] other is right he belongs in the church
[1:10:42] brother Branham wanted church that has a
[1:10:45] burden to pray
[1:10:46] a burden to pray in church and a burden
[1:10:49] to pray at home and they burden to pray
[1:10:51] every way
[1:10:55] we talking about teachers how to pray
[1:10:59] amen
[1:11:00] why do we need all of these things why
[1:11:04] is the importance in prayer
[1:11:07] brother Branham say
[1:11:10] prayer is the most father first
[1:11:14] that God ever put in the hand of a
[1:11:17] mankind
[1:11:19] the most effective force that is known
[1:11:22] to man is prayer do you believe that yes
[1:11:26] sir
[1:11:27] yes sir it is prayer that changes things
[1:11:31] if you want something to change in your
[1:11:33] life go to prayer amen
[1:11:36] if you want your children to change go
[1:11:39] to prayer amen if you need a good job
[1:11:42] God to pray if you want to change in
[1:11:45] your marriages God to pray
[1:11:47] if you want a good church God to pray
[1:11:49] amen
[1:11:51] why Prayer Changes Things
[1:11:58] in the second quote get the people to
[1:12:01] believe brother Branham saying god
[1:12:04] listen to a mortal's prayer
[1:12:08] and I say this with all true reverence
[1:12:11] there is not another force on Earth
[1:12:13] there is nothing on Earth no matter what
[1:12:16] it is what kind of gift it is
[1:12:20] there is nothing in the world that will
[1:12:24] come ahead of Prayer
[1:12:27] prayer is what does the work
[1:12:30] that's right
[1:12:32] we are talking too much
[1:12:37] you are spending five hours on the
[1:12:39] telephone try to solve something try
[1:12:42] praying
[1:12:45] [Applause]
[1:12:47] prayer will serve a situation without
[1:12:50] you doing anything
[1:12:54] prayer will change your situation when
[1:12:56] you are sleeping when you are eating
[1:12:59] prayer will resolve problems
[1:13:02] prayer will keep your child in school
[1:13:05] when you are not around yourself
[1:13:08] prayer will keep your husband at work
[1:13:11] [Music]
[1:13:13] come back
[1:13:19] if your husband is struggling with
[1:13:21] something
[1:13:22] put him in prayer
[1:13:26] because you're not going to be driving
[1:13:28] around with him put him in prayer
[1:13:31] and see what prayer can do
[1:13:34] oh God
[1:13:37] I'm I'm just on the surface we are
[1:13:39] dropping slowly okay
[1:13:42] brother Branham say in my angel go
[1:13:44] before me he said whatsoever you ask the
[1:13:48] father
[1:13:49] in my name that I will do whatsoever
[1:13:52] things
[1:13:54] Mark 11 24 whatsoever thinks you desire
[1:13:58] When you pray
[1:14:00] believe you receive it you shall have it
[1:14:03] now he gave us the strongest weapon that
[1:14:08] there is in all the world
[1:14:10] and that is prayer
[1:14:11] is what changes things
[1:14:15] the Christian does not relax
[1:14:18] what a force he has when he kneels on
[1:14:23] his knee before almighty God In The Name
[1:14:27] of Jesus Christ
[1:14:28] he does not realize what power that it
[1:14:31] is if the people could only realize that
[1:14:36] what is given right unto them anything
[1:14:39] that you ask for will be given if you
[1:14:43] can appropriate the faith to believe it
[1:14:46] for God's word is true

[1:15:09] to do
[1:15:11] and the only way and not to do is prayer

[1:19:22] and we put our intellect on top of them
[1:19:24] that's why we don't see God doing many
[1:19:27] things
[1:19:28] because we miss the order
[1:19:30] the top of your life should be prayer
[1:19:35] everything

[1:19:59] change we need prayer we understand that
[1:20:01] prayer need to be the first place
[1:20:04] but can you teach somebody how to pray
[1:20:09] are you trying to introduce a
[1:20:11] Catholicism in the message
[1:20:13] can you teach somebody prayer or prayer
[1:20:16] is somebody that some ill or or is it
[1:20:19] something that someone needs to know
[1:20:20] let's go to Luke chapter 11.
[1:20:25] my subject tonight is teach us to pray
[1:20:31] let's go to Luke chapter 11. if you dare
[1:20:35] you can say Amen
[1:20:37] oh God
[1:20:40] Hallelujah
[1:20:44] thank you Jesus if you're there you can
[1:20:47] say Amen
[1:20:48] can you teach somebody how to pray
[1:20:52] Luke chapter 11 verse 1. if you dare you
[1:20:54] can say amen amen the Bible say and he
[1:20:58] came to pass that as he was what pray in
[1:21:01] a certain place when he did water ceased
[1:21:04] one of his disciples say unto him the
[1:21:08] Lord daughter teach us to pray that's
[1:21:11] why I got my tattoo
[1:21:14] so the disciple were living with Jesus
[1:21:18] Christ and the notice in the life of
[1:21:20] Jesus Christ that he was praying a
[1:21:23] certain way amen that they don't know
[1:21:26] [Applause]
[1:21:29] instead of just following Jesus Christ
[1:21:32] one of the disciples stood and say wait
[1:21:35] a minute
[1:21:36] when we go throughout the day this man
[1:21:39] doesn't pray too much
[1:21:41] he's always executing miracle
[1:21:47] why because he's already charged up
[1:21:51] before he can go out amen everybody okay
[1:21:54] his gasoline has already been filled
[1:21:58] amen Jesus was feeling his tank with
[1:22:02] prayer
[1:22:03] [Applause]
[1:22:03] [Music]
[1:22:06] so when he get on the highway if there
[1:22:09] is a traffic he doesn't bother him he
[1:22:12] bothered the one who doesn't have enough
[1:22:14] gasoline
[1:22:15] [Applause]
[1:22:20] because he's ambushed he didn't know
[1:22:22] whether there would be an accident on
[1:22:24] the road or not
[1:22:25] amen so one of the disciples they watch
[1:22:29] him praying praying praying praying
[1:22:30] praying when he finish he came out he
[1:22:33] say Lord
[1:22:35] teach us how to water pray so you can
[1:22:38] teach somebody how to pray amen
[1:22:41] it is not Catholicism oh sir everybody
[1:22:44] okay he said teach us to pray Karma as
[1:22:49] who John also did what else are his
[1:22:51] disciples
[1:22:53] so John the Baptist
[1:22:55] sat down and taught his disciple had to
[1:22:59] pray
[1:23:01] amen
[1:23:03] in the message we enter in the message
[1:23:06] and we grow up in the message and very
[1:23:09] few times have we learned how to pray
[1:23:13] preach Brothers

[1:23:21] denomination they came under
[1:23:25] if somebody came from the Pentecostal
[1:23:27] Church they will be praying like a
[1:23:29] Pentecostal the Baptists will pray like
[1:23:32] a Baptist the one who came from the
[1:23:34] Methodist will pray like a Methodist
[1:23:39] but the disciples say Lord do what teach
[1:23:43] us how to do what to pray
[1:23:47] so you can teach somebody how to pray
[1:23:50] amen so we want to know
[1:23:53] prayer

[1:42:11] it is too much on him he lost his family
[1:42:14] he loves his children he loves his

[1:47:13] you there
[1:47:14] I'm going to read the message communion
[1:47:18] prayer is back and forth
[1:47:21] in other word prayer is communion
[1:47:24] [Music]
[1:47:28] prayer
[1:47:30] is communion
[1:47:37] oh God
[1:47:40] you have to understand these things so
[1:47:42] you know now how to pray
[1:47:45] brother Branham in the message communion
[1:47:47] he says communion is to talk
[1:47:52] and he talks back job told us
[1:47:56] something that you talk to
[1:47:59] the very word commune means to talk to
[1:48:03] or be associated with something that is
[1:48:08] talking back to you
[1:48:10] is God a love yes sir is God a human
[1:48:13] being the man Jesus Christ so God can
[1:48:16] talk
[1:48:17] God can even write he wrote down when he
[1:48:21] was on Earth he wrote on the wall of uh
[1:48:24] Babylon or Babylon
[1:48:27] amen
[1:48:30] brother brought them say
[1:48:33] go to paragraph 30. he say but I have
[1:48:37] wondered many times if that word we use
[1:48:40] is just right communion
[1:48:42] communion means to talk to
[1:48:44] see to commune with I wonder if really
[1:48:49] when we meet together like this in
[1:48:52] Heavenly places if that is not communion
[1:48:55] that we are communing with God talking
[1:48:58] to him
[1:48:59] listen to this 31 and then if we just
[1:49:03] sit still
[1:49:05] can you put that on the board so
[1:49:07] everybody says it
[1:49:10] [Music]
[1:49:14] because we pray many of us pray like
[1:49:17] Pentecostal
[1:49:19] yeah out
[1:49:25] teach us how to pray
[1:49:29] then if we could just do water sit still
[1:49:33] and let him do water commune 31.
[1:49:37] and let him answer back probably it's
[1:49:40] not that one that's 45 it should be
[1:49:42] paragraph 31. amen you go into the one
[1:49:46] further that was 48 go back again the
[1:49:49] one back
[1:49:50] they all come right there 31. you there
[1:49:52] he said if we just sit still and let him
[1:49:56] answer us back many thing and the one of
[1:50:01] the water horrible things
[1:50:03] who does that
[1:50:06] do
[1:50:19] I try to do all the water talking
[1:50:24] brother Kalima miss you my friend
[1:50:27] and not sit still how long enough for
[1:50:30] him to do water answer me back we do
[1:50:33] that so many times in water
[1:50:38] so when you pray
[1:50:41] you must also eat better to hear from
[1:50:45] somebody that's right
[1:50:47] [Music]
[1:50:48] welcome to the supernatural world
[1:50:52] if your religion was just like this
[1:50:55] today you need to start hearing from God
[1:50:58] that's right you will know the voice of
[1:51:00] God you will know God God will begin to
[1:51:03] talk in your life
[1:51:07] 25 years have you heard God talking in
[1:51:09] your life you don't even know how God
[1:51:11] talk
[1:51:14] I think we will get off of our heart
[1:51:17] what is in a job
[1:51:20] and express ourselves to the Lord Jesus
[1:51:22] job and then just kneel and just be how
[1:51:26] steal a water wow just see what he would
[1:51:30] what say back to us
[1:51:33] sometime I have did that and my whole
[1:51:37] opinion was changed
[1:51:40] you see I go ask him something
[1:51:43] now Lord these people really they got
[1:51:46] something I believe they want me over
[1:51:48] there and I just pray start praying and
[1:51:50] the first thing you know I'm just
[1:51:52] satisfied that it's the Lord will so
[1:51:55] brother Brandon pray Lord these people
[1:51:57] want me to do and when brother stop you
[1:51:59] say ah it's the Lord's will and he begin
[1:52:01] to go but look where the burner before
[1:52:04] he goes he stopped a little bit to hear
[1:52:07] back from God what is God saying
[1:52:10] brother Branham say but after I pray
[1:52:14] I just do it linger a little while
[1:52:18] then it is well changed all together
[1:52:22] sometimes sent somewhere else just
[1:52:25] commune with the Lord oh how glorious
[1:52:29] Fellowship
[1:52:32] if you're too quick that's why you
[1:52:34] continue to do what you already have in
[1:52:36] mind
[1:52:40] you already purpose in your mind you're
[1:52:42] gonna go there and you go pray five
[1:52:44] minutes you wake up and you go yeah
[1:52:46] that's what you have in your mind
[1:52:47] what does God have for you
[1:52:50] prayer is going back and forth that's
[1:52:53] right
[1:52:54] prayer is a firm call
[1:52:57] from Earth
[1:52:59] everybody okay and a phone call from
[1:53:02] Heaven it is you talking and you stop
[1:53:06] for God to talk back that's right
[1:53:13] everybody okay amen everybody okay
[1:53:18] go to 49 on the next one then I'm gonna
[1:53:20] get the definition
[1:53:23] brother Branham say there is where many
[1:53:25] times that we make a great mistake we do
[1:53:28] all the talking and don't wait and give
[1:53:31] him a chance to do what to answer that
[1:53:33] we got sometimes say Lord I would that
[1:53:36] you do so and so and so and so amen and
[1:53:39] get up and leave now that is not that is
[1:53:43] not communion that is going and asking a
[1:53:46] water a favor but when you stay how long
[1:53:49] enough until he does water answers so
[1:53:52] the life of prayer is not about you
[1:53:55] talking
[1:53:56] [Applause]
[1:53:58] you are staying two hours maybe you talk
[1:54:01] 45 minutes the other hours is you
[1:54:04] keeping quiet so you can hear him to say
[1:54:07] something that's right
[1:54:10] our life is if somebody say I pray two
[1:54:14] hours it means from starting to finish
[1:54:17] every second he was the only one talking
[1:54:22] teach us how to pray
[1:54:26] but when you stay long enough until he
[1:54:29] hears her back that is when you get to
[1:54:31] what communion communing with who the
[1:54:34] Lord now a great way to commune is to be
[1:54:37] have agree you must agree upon what
[1:54:39] certain things
[1:54:40] job was looking for something where is
[1:54:44] God where does God live if I found him I
[1:54:48] will get inside I will talk to him and
[1:54:51] then I'm gonna hear what he says back to
[1:54:54] me how do we find the address of God
[1:54:57] [Music]
[1:54:59] God is in heaven how do you enter Heaven
[1:55:03] [Applause]
[1:55:05] how do you get to heaven

[1:55:13] do you use which ticket do you use which
[1:55:17] Highway do you use
[1:55:19] what is prayer
[1:55:24] and probably we slow down here because
[1:55:26] it's getting someone
[1:55:29] everybody okay
[1:55:32] in the message that knoweth all things
[1:55:35] it says definition
[1:55:38] you there in paragraph 17 I want you to
[1:55:41] follow me carefully
[1:55:43] brother Branham say see what prayer does
[1:55:49] I want you to bring it my friend because
[1:55:51] I don't want you to hang on my word
[1:55:55] amen
[1:55:56] we are on earth we're trying to
[1:55:59] communicate with water jobs say there is
[1:56:02] one thing I need get me into his house
[1:56:05] when I get into the presence of the king
[1:56:07] he will ask me like King Esther like a
[1:56:10] Queen Esther what do you need what is
[1:56:12] bringing you here what is going on here
[1:56:15] Queenie tell me
[1:56:17] amen then you tell him what you want and
[1:56:20] he can cancel whatever he was trying to
[1:56:22] do he say I'm coming to your banquet
[1:56:24] right now amen but you must leave your
[1:56:27] place to go into his place how do you
[1:56:30] leave your place to go into his place
[1:56:33] we know now he live in heaven Jesus said
[1:56:36] when you pray you say Our Father which
[1:56:38] are in heaven we know where he is
[1:56:42] how do I get to heaven
[1:56:44] Amen in heaven why because there is a
[1:56:48] separation
[1:56:49] you there all right let's go
[1:56:53] see what prayer does help me my brother
[1:56:56] prayer is not exactly what bringing God
[1:57:00] down to man
[1:57:04] that's what we usually think I'm praying
[1:57:07] I'm praying I'm praying and God is
[1:57:09] coming down
[1:57:12] brother Branham say prayer is not
[1:57:15] bringing God down
[1:57:18] God will come down as a result of Prayer
[1:57:24] I have heard the Cry of my people and I
[1:57:27] have come down to deliver them
[1:57:30] but before I come down the people were
[1:57:33] crying
[1:57:35] they were praying
[1:57:37] then I heard their prayer and I came
[1:57:40] down
[1:57:41] in other words somebody calls someone
[1:57:44] and say I need help and that person left
[1:57:47] whatever they were doing and went to
[1:57:49] rescue
[1:57:51] everybody okay brother Branham say
[1:57:54] prayer is not exactly bringing God down
[1:57:57] to me
[1:57:58] it is bringing water man how up to God
[1:58:06] said show me his place Jesus said when
[1:58:10] you pray say Our Father which are in
[1:58:12] what heaven Jesus already gave you the
[1:58:15] destination
[1:58:16] My Father which is not in Gastonia not
[1:58:19] in Africa not in America he is in a
[1:58:22] specific place which is called heaven
[1:58:25] and brother Branham explained to us that
[1:58:28] heaven is not far away
[1:58:32] brother Brahman say heaven is where here
[1:58:35] only in the water another dimension in
[1:58:39] other words Heaven is here but the
[1:58:43] problem is the connection
[1:58:49] brother Branham say heaven is not far
[1:58:52] far away Heaven is here that's right but
[1:58:55] we are just Out Of Tune
[1:58:58] we are out of the presence of God we are
[1:59:01] out of connection amen that's why we
[1:59:04] don't feel him
[1:59:08] brother Branham say prayer what is
[1:59:11] prayer prayer is a way to take you to
[1:59:15] heaven
[1:59:16] to take you to the place job was looking
[1:59:19] for because once you enter Heaven that's
[1:59:23] it
[1:59:28] when we say heaven
[1:59:30] I'm not talking about when you enter
[1:59:32] Heaven you begin to see the cloud
[1:59:38] prayer it's bringing man how up to God
[1:59:43] listen carefully I don't know I need to
[1:59:46] stop somewhere
[1:59:48] see
[1:59:49] as you do water right you do water you
[1:59:52] lose sight of water these Earthly things
[1:59:55] brother Branham say when you start
[1:59:58] praying
[1:59:59] amen before you start praying you are
[2:00:03] worrying about your children yeah
[2:00:05] maybe you came from work
[2:00:08] whatever happened at work is in your
[2:00:10] mind
[2:00:10] everybody okay you were driving on the
[2:00:13] highway you saw maybe Food Lion you saw
[2:00:16] people there you were on the phone
[2:00:18] talking so your mind is so crowded and
[2:00:22] you are in full contact with the Earth
[2:00:26] the heaven seems to be far away now
[2:00:30] brother Branham said before you pray
[2:00:33] everybody okay you need to start first
[2:00:36] leaving the Earth
[2:00:37] [Music]
[2:00:41] in other words as you are entering in
[2:00:44] prayer what happened and work need to go
[2:00:50] what you saw in the highway need to go
[2:00:52] that's right
[2:00:54] amen
[2:00:56] everybody okay you are already changing
[2:00:59] dimension
[2:01:02] oh God
[2:01:06] let's go my brain
[2:01:08] as you pray
[2:01:10] you lose sight of this water Earthly
[2:01:14] thing that's the reason why
[2:01:16] men pray with their eyes closed
[2:01:23] normally you can pray with your eyes
[2:01:25] open
[2:01:26] the reason we close our eyes is to shut
[2:01:30] us out
[2:01:32] from what is surrounding us right amen
[2:01:36] amen when I'm here I have a puppet I
[2:01:40] have brother a polycarp I have the
[2:01:43] microphone I'm trying to forget all of
[2:01:46] this
[2:01:48] and to begin to think about one person
[2:01:52] this man that is on the picture that's
[2:01:54] right
[2:01:55] [Applause]
[2:01:57] Cannot drop something
[2:02:00] that's the reason why brother Kalima
[2:02:02] brother Branham have a tendency to pray
[2:02:06] before the picture of half man
[2:02:09] [Applause]
[2:02:14] because brother Branham wanna keep his
[2:02:17] focus on who he's going to talk to amen
[2:02:22] I am not talking to the pastor I'm
[2:02:25] talking to the man that look like this
[2:02:28] Offman picture
[2:02:29] [Applause]
[2:02:31] then I'm closing my eyes so I forget
[2:02:34] who's beside me
[2:02:35] [Music]
[2:02:37] and as you begin to Lose Yourself Amen
[2:02:41] in other words as you begin to detach
[2:02:44] from your surrendering that's when you
[2:02:48] are entering Heaven amen
[2:02:51] and the way to do it is by praying
[2:02:55] prayer is the vehicle that take you in
[2:02:59] the presence of God
[2:03:00] [Applause]
[2:03:10] we all are rebuked by this
[2:03:13] everybody okay everybody okay that's why
[2:03:17] before we pray amen we have a tendency
[2:03:22] to sing
[2:03:25] all we're trying to do is to get us out
[2:03:30] of what we wear
[2:03:35] are you trying to do is to detach
[2:03:39] from what was going on in the house so
[2:03:42] you can focus so the children can focus
[2:03:45] so everybody can begin to focus like
[2:03:48] okay okay okay now now now we are
[2:03:50] talking to to God we need to sit well we
[2:03:53] need to fix our skirt we need to to
[2:03:55] dress how we are because if you don't
[2:03:58] you're not conscious of that amen you
[2:04:02] can begin to pray you don't know how you
[2:04:03] pray
[2:04:04] but when you begin to know that I'm
[2:04:06] approaching God you will see a sister
[2:04:07] pulling
[2:04:09] because you are detaching you are now
[2:04:11] approaching somewhere
[2:04:14] let's go my brother and we can stop as
[2:04:16] you pray you lose sight of this water
[2:04:18] everything you sway out somewhere else
[2:04:22] way behind Beyond and water on and on
[2:04:26] and on until you become into water this
[2:04:29] present that's what job was looking for
[2:04:30] amen
[2:04:32] everybody okay
[2:04:34] then a fifth that you have laid it out
[2:04:37] before who God say now hear God here it
[2:04:41] is in other words you cannot ask until
[2:04:45] you get there
[2:04:48] amen
[2:04:52] brother Stephen
[2:04:54] if I need to get there
[2:04:56] how do I get there without asking
[2:04:59] because we get in our prayer
[2:05:01] in five seconds we start asking
[2:05:05] did you get into his presence
[2:05:08] did you get into his presence brother
[2:05:10] Branham say before you ask first you
[2:05:14] need to lose everything amen and you
[2:05:17] need to enter first into his presence
[2:05:20] once you enter in his presence then you
[2:05:23] begin to ask
[2:05:25] amen that's the reason why help me
[2:05:29] brother Robert Jesus say our father who
[2:05:34] are in water heaven
[2:05:37] go ahead again Hallowed be thy name did
[2:05:40] you see Jesus asking no sir it's later
[2:05:43] that Jesus said give us our daily bread
[2:05:46] oh
[2:05:48] that's right are you with me Jesus never
[2:05:50] said Our Father which is heaven give us
[2:05:55] Our Father which away in heaven Hallowed
[2:05:59] be thy water what are you doing by
[2:06:02] hallowby amazing
[2:06:04] glorifying you are worshiping him first
[2:06:11] so when you stop prayer you need to
[2:06:14] start praying by worship that's right
[2:06:17] and worship is taking you into his
[2:06:21] presence that's right once you fill his
[2:06:24] presence around you
[2:06:26] that's when you begin to talk
[2:06:31] teach us how to pray
[2:06:36] let's go my friend sorry about Robert
[2:06:39] as you pray you lose no now on the blue
[2:06:43] color now here God here it is I want to
[2:06:47] get well for this cause I want you to do
[2:06:50] this for me and this course I want you
[2:06:52] to hear me from this cancer or TB or
[2:06:55] anemia condition or whatever it is I
[2:06:58] will walk before you
[2:06:59] I will do everything I can I will give
[2:07:03] this testimony Everywhere I Go
[2:07:05] all of this are teaching right there is
[2:07:08] linking
[2:07:09] if you notice what Abraham is giving
[2:07:12] uh I mean a request with a reason why a
[2:07:15] request with a reason why jobs say I
[2:07:18] will give it with argument
[2:07:20] everybody okay he said I will be happy
[2:07:22] to do that law I will use my life not
[2:07:25] for myself I will use it for your glory
[2:07:27] to help other to see you do you see the
[2:07:30] prayer this prayer you talk only when
[2:07:32] you are in presence that's why Jesus
[2:07:35] said Our Father which are aware
[2:07:37] the water Hallowed be thy name Hallowed
[2:07:41] be thy name
[2:07:43] you see two three words in the prayer of
[2:07:46] Jesus what he means
[2:07:47] look what we were doing
[2:07:50] let me read this quote and then we wind
[2:07:52] up we stop somewhere here you there
[2:07:56] next my friend where you say definition
[2:07:58] the next one
[2:08:00] follow me carefully and I close this
[2:08:03] We Understand Job
[2:08:06] Supernatural brother Branham says this
[2:08:08] God never come
[2:08:11] for just any haphazard way
[2:08:18] is not perhaps
[2:08:21] please are you reading with me yes sir
[2:08:24] prayer is the water
[2:08:28] is talking to God
[2:08:32] watch brother Branham
[2:08:34] prayer is not
[2:08:37] okay get done shut your eyes and
[2:08:41] thinking about your washing all your
[2:08:44] work you are doing say Lord help me and
[2:08:48] John heal Mrs John and so forth that is
[2:08:52] not a prayer that is water repeating
[2:08:55] some words
[2:08:57] that's why we don't go nowhere
[2:09:00] when you are to praying you are thinking
[2:09:03] about something else
[2:09:05] in other words you are like this but
[2:09:07] your mind is somewhere when the Pastor
[2:09:09] said let's pray you are still thinking
[2:09:12] about the dishwasher at home
[2:09:14] brother Branham say your word is just
[2:09:17] repeating
[2:09:18] it's a formality
[2:09:21] because we want the one who's standing
[2:09:23] here to do the praying not us and and
[2:09:26] matter of fact we are listening to his
[2:09:28] prayer to make sure he is God in every
[2:09:30] request
[2:09:35] everybody okay everybody okay brother
[2:09:38] Branham said that is not prayer that is
[2:09:41] repeating some word listen now but
[2:09:44] prayer follow me carefully please I'm
[2:09:47] closing but prayer is what to come into
[2:09:50] water an atmosphere where you realize
[2:09:54] that you are in the water the presence
[2:09:56] of God and you are moving to them in
[2:09:59] house the deepest of sincerity first it
[2:10:02] is a worship
[2:10:04] [Music]
[2:10:07] uh-huh
[2:10:09] first it is water
[2:10:11] oh Jehovah I love you you see them after
[2:10:16] the water worship prayer then you come
[2:10:19] with us and see heart doing what you
[2:10:22] cannot ask without worshiping
[2:10:25] amen because the mother prayer say our
[2:10:29] father who are in water heaven Hallowed
[2:10:32] be that name that Kingdom I will get
[2:10:35] that that way I can't guess in that
[2:10:36] Kingdom Come
[2:10:38] amen
[2:10:40] I can't get in that Kingdom Come that
[2:10:43] will be another day
[2:10:45] because we need to know what does it
[2:10:48] mean our kingdom come
[2:10:51] because it's a mother prayer
[2:10:53] what do you keep today
[2:10:57] teach us how to pray
[2:11:02] ER is your vehicle
[2:11:05] everywhere that will take you from this
[2:11:08] Dimension to the heaven the heaven we're
[2:11:11] talking about it's not a heaven over
[2:11:12] there in the solar system that's the
[2:11:14] second heaven
[2:11:16] which is the solar system the first
[2:11:18] Heaven is the sky the third is what
[2:11:21] we're talking about
[2:11:22] amen and brother Branham said the third
[2:11:25] heaven is here but it's just in the
[2:11:27] fastest Dimension amen but the reason
[2:11:30] why you lose connection is because of
[2:11:32] your body your five senses are
[2:11:35] contacting the Earth all the time
[2:11:37] everybody okay when you're driving on
[2:11:39] your when you are walking in your house
[2:11:41] you see a spot there you need to clean
[2:11:43] this oh there is no sugar no that that's
[2:11:45] that's automatically the five senses
[2:11:48] that's the word you are in amen that's
[2:11:50] why we are the connection
[2:11:52] but God is worthy so now prayer is what
[2:11:56] take you from this Atmos for this Cosmos
[2:11:59] for the activities of the day and take
[2:12:03] you out
[2:12:05] until you drive in your car your
[2:12:08] subconscious knows that you're going
[2:12:10] somewhere that your mind is not in your
[2:12:13] car
[2:12:15] and someone will tell you did you see
[2:12:18] brother John over there brother John
[2:12:19] just pass us because your mind is
[2:12:22] somewhere
[2:12:24] you won't have an accident because your
[2:12:27] subconscious already memorized the exit
[2:12:30] to work
[2:12:33] you know how to leave my house to go to
[2:12:35] brother Mickey's House your subconscious
[2:12:38] will take you there you don't need a GPS
[2:12:41] you don't need a GPS to come to church
[2:12:43] how many people here use the GPS to come
[2:12:45] to church
[2:12:46] but how many times do you come to church
[2:12:49] and you talking on the phone
[2:12:50] how are you driving getting to your
[2:12:53] destination and you're talking on the
[2:12:54] phone
[2:12:55] is the talking of the phone I mean uh
[2:12:58] stopping your driving
[2:13:00] that's how prayer is
[2:13:03] until you can pass every stop sign and
[2:13:07] you don't see whatever is there somebody
[2:13:10] else will be looking like look at
[2:13:11] Mcdonough look at Chick-fil-A look at
[2:13:13] this but if you are under into a
[2:13:16] different world
[2:13:17] you will realize that you map passive
[2:13:20] and McDonald don't see McDonald because
[2:13:22] you are detached from the world and the
[2:13:25] only way to get detached is the prayer
[2:13:28] how do you detach from prayer you need
[2:13:31] to start getting into the atmosphere
[2:13:38] you need to create an atmosphere of
[2:13:41] prayer that's why you don't pray when
[2:13:43] you're upset
[2:13:46] you are praying when there is an
[2:13:49] atmosphere that's why we sing before we
[2:13:52] pray because we're trying to do what
[2:13:54] create an atmosphere that's why we stop
[2:13:57] the TV before we pray because we want to
[2:14:00] do water that's why we stop the
[2:14:03] telephone before we pray because we're
[2:14:06] trying to do water creating Atmos that's
[2:14:08] why we stop everything and everything is
[2:14:10] quiet in the house and every child is
[2:14:12] sitting in their place before we start
[2:14:14] the water
[2:14:17] and when the atmosphere is set our
[2:14:20] father
[2:14:21] which are in water Heaven before you
[2:14:24] start saying bless mommy bless this one
[2:14:26] bless this one
[2:14:28] in other words you start worshiping
[2:14:31] first
[2:14:32] Lord I thank you because you have been
[2:14:34] so good to me
[2:14:36] Lord You Are My Creator father you the
[2:14:39] mercy God
[2:14:40] the merciful god you're the one that
[2:14:43] died for me at the Cavalry Lord how much
[2:14:45] I love you
[2:14:47] how much I miss you
[2:14:49] when you're doing that you are
[2:14:51] automatically God of Adam said first
[2:14:53] worship when you are doing that you are
[2:14:55] moving from the things of the world you
[2:14:59] are detaching from this environment and
[2:15:02] you are entering into a different
[2:15:04] environment that job was looking for and
[2:15:07] when you enter in that environment
[2:15:09] that's when you need to plead your case
[2:15:12] and not only pleading your case you need
[2:15:15] to wait for him to tell you what do you
[2:15:17] think about the case
[2:15:21] Our Father which are in heaven
[2:15:24] Hallowed be thy name that's where we
[2:15:27] stop
[2:15:28] let's bow ahead
[2:15:41] time is up
[2:15:44] foreign
[2:15:50] you heard
[2:15:53] we could continue doing what we do

[2:16:01] sometime he works sometime he doesn't
[2:16:04] work
[2:16:06] amen
[2:16:07] you heard what God spoke to you
[2:16:10] you heard what he says
[2:16:13] time is gone
[2:16:15] but for few minutes
[2:16:17] amen
[2:16:20] as you close in your head your eyes you
[2:16:23] bow in your head
[2:16:24] forget about who is beside you
[2:16:28] forget about what is going on at home
[2:16:31] forget about everything
[2:16:34] amen
[2:16:39] begin to talk to him
[2:16:42] and let's thank him
[2:16:46] and let's worship Him
[2:16:48] and we talked to him a few minutes and
[2:16:50] we can go home
[2:16:52] put a lot of volume on the music just
[2:16:54] the music a little bit
[2:17:00] I know now
[2:17:01] many of you don't want to speak loud
[2:17:05] it's because of something that we will
[2:17:07] learn later
[2:17:12] but if you know who you're going to see
[2:17:15] you forget about what is going on
[2:17:17] brother give them some music so they can
[2:17:19] speak to their King
[2:17:21] and we can all talk to our King
