how are you doing I know somebody's there Mana make it to your house but at least I can see you in church amen let's go to our scripture in Genesis 21 I made an announcement uh last Sunday and we were only able to lay the foundation on Sunday and the foundation we laid was only by the scripture we were unable even to touch the prophet that's right amen but I'm going to say it again I'm turning the corner okay God gave us three day uh three years when we start this ministry the Lord lay Foundation left and right and clean up our lives he he will continue to do that but we reach a point where I have to turn the corner goad amen if you afraid like I said on Sunday hold me really tight tight amen it's a spiritual holding so hold me very tight even if you hear like we almost right there don't worry we're not going to fall I have to turn the corner amen and by turning the corner I'm going to pick you up wherever you are if you're in kindergarten we pick you up you're in first grade we pick you up in other words you cannot stay where you are we have to push you forward everybody good amen amen amen okay let's go to Genesis 21 glory to God and again if a minister get across with what I'm delivering please before you start fighting hold on go back to the last sermon go through the scripture go through the message of the hour make sure you know what you're talking about amen because I lay the scripture I have not even touched brother Bram now today by God's grace I'm going to start pulling brother Bram and you see what brother brandham say amen amen I know it's going to shake people it might trouble some but I have no choice I don't have a bishop so I have to deliver amen I'm not delivering this to fight no I'm delivering this to help the children of God I have no choice I have to deliver amen Genesis 21:9 if you thereare you can say amen I just want to pick up something here so Genesis 22 makes sense amen amen am verse n and Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian which he had born to Abraham mocking in other words word ridiculing you might be seated wherefore said uh wherefore she said my pilot is right there sir okay praise God glory to God thank God I didn't deliver my thought last Sunday because I miss you I was like if he was old enough I need to get him married quickly I say when he's old enough so he can stay put a little bit amen amen because he's doing a great job you go home and sit and hear him the way he's going he follows the spirit correctly amen glory to God who knows what is inside there I'm only responsible for what I say that's okay amen that's me amen wherefore she said to Abraham cast out this Bond woman and her son this bondn woman it's no more Hagar this bondn woman and her son for the son of this Bond woman shall not be here with my son even with Isaac precisely amen amen because Abraham had at this point only two children at this point the other children came after Sarah was dead amen so now a circumstance happen at home where they have to remove one of them amen watch verse 11 and the things were very was very Grievous in Abraham sight because of his what son so he was a son of Abraham amen now I'm going to kick my son out because they were having a fight with his brother wow amen amen so Abraham now is going through a painful time amen but the seed cannot haar with the Shar so a separation must happen separation are painful so don't expect separating and you laughing so you're not really separating when you separate and it's painful you know it's working amen and God was in it God was in this scenario right now it looks like it's Sarah who's protecting Isaac and Sarah is coming up with the idea but let's see what's going on amen amen verse 12 and God said to Abraham let it not be Grievous in other word when Abraham was sorrowful God came he said hey what's going on you know what's going on he said chill out slow down yes I'm putting that in plain word so we all understand say slow down what's wrong why you crying like a child s say say that come on this is now God not Sarah he said let it not be Grievous in your sight because of the L and because of your Bond woman in all that Sarah had said not some everything that Sarah said in all that Sarah has said to you you do what hearken hearken to what her voice in other words Sarah is right that's right so what Sarah was saying was the word of God that's why Paul pick it up in the book of uh Roman and Paul quot Sarah amen he say in all that Sarah has said to you hearken to her voice yes sir for in Isaac shall your seed be what called so God open a new promise to Abraham in a painful time amen amen amen Lord I know why I'm saying this sir if you don't if you don't understand this you won't understand Genesis 22 Amen in the painful time the time of distress amen that painful moment amen God revealed something to Abraham about Isaac amen he says through Isaac your seed will come in PL word Isaac will have children you didn't get it God is telling Abraham that you see Isaac yes Isaac won't die that's right that now now now we start getting in Isaac was a child a child cannot have a baby to have a baby he need to grow in other word Isaac need to grow and have a baby and when he have children through those children I will bring the Messiah there am so God lock himself up God put himself in trouble because Abraham now is going to use that against God are we together yes sir are we together so according to this place God is telling Abraham Abraham Isaac will have children and Isaac had children he had Esau and Jacob so there is nothing that can bother Isaac if he has not have a child yet are we together are we together so what seems to be a painful Experience open up a greater Revelation what seems to be a hard trial for job it is open up something about the resurrection are we together are we together in here A promise is given about Isaac having the children and through his genealogy will come the seed which is Christ amen amen let's go now to Genesis 22 so you understand now two things happen number one they have to separate Ishmael out he has to leave the seed cannot be here with the Shar they have to separate them after the separation a promise was given now watch now Genesis 22 Genesis 22:1 and he came to pass after what these things you understand these things now now you begin to understand these things if you don't read it you don't understand what really happened and it came to pass after these things that God did what tempt Abraham how can God tempt somebody come on brother the Bible say God doesn't tempt people that's what the Bible says this temptation is not the temptation of James that's right that's exactly right brother the temptation of James is a Temptation toward doing something wrong corre toward the last that's why James say everybody's is uh is tempted according to the last that's right but God was not tempting Abraham to do something wrong are we together glory to God he says and God did tempt Abraham and say to him Abraham and he say behold here I am way can pay attention Budd amen and he said take now your son your only son ISAC whom you love for the first time in the history God is requiring a human sacrifice amen please do you have your Bible oh God for the first time in the history God want a human sacrifice sir and the human sacrifice is a child only child of a man what is he talking about we clear listen he says and he says take now your son your only son who Isaac whom you love so this son God already seen the love that Abraham have toward Isaac remember Abraham is already deprive of Ishmael and he grieve him so hard now they they already remov Ishmael Ishmael is gone okay no problem he's probably the son of a born woman that's okay but I still have Sarah by the way I didn't choose to have I mean ishma it was Saha that brought ish now I heaven and God say I know what I'm going to do now God goes to that son again he said give me that oneus Isel stay alive but this one God want slay him if Ishmael was too hard for Abraham how much more Isaac and God told him that I know how you love him I know exactly how you love him that's the one that I want but you told me to kick Ismael out I kick Ismael out I only have one child left now you coming to take this child and to slay him everybody okay amen but God told Abraham you following me Isaac cannot die without having what a child was Isaac having a baby do you see the trial of God amen amen watch now amen he says to whom you love and get you into the land land of what Mariah do you know what this land is about have you ever studied the scripture where Isaac offered H where Abraham offered Isaac at that place that's where the Temple of Solomon was built do you know that remind me after church I'm going to send you the scripture yes the very place that Isaac was offered amen that's where Solomon came and built the temple so the first sacrifice of the temple was from Abraham in other word God was indicating to Abraham this is where the temple is going to be right is this a trial or somebody's writing a Bible watch this he said get you into the land of Moriah and offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountain which I will tell you so God indicated the place of worship that's why the temple was built there amen and Abraham rose up early in the morning remember Sarah stays home we talked about it and sat on his ass and took two of his young men with him and Isaac his son and he split the wood for the burnt offering and Rose up and went to the place of which God has told him watch now verse four then on the third day it took it took three days three days journey the first day we're not there yet the second day we not there yet the third day we arrived but we not there yet are we okay it took three stages amen it took justification yes sir they didn't reach it yet then they went into sanctification they didn't reach it yet then they went to the baptism of the Holy Ghost but the place was still a far off on now okay let's go to verse four then on the third day Abraham lift up what his eyes and saw the place where far so the third day was not even though they were there the place was still further are we together so when you move from the first day to the second day to the third day you need to go a little bit further then the third day amen and this this this distance here this extra distance here only Abraham alone with Isaac can go there whoever was going with Abraham the ask the servant everybody must stay on the third dayus beyond the third day nobody goes there [Music] are we together are we together we are on the place of the third day right here that's one place a and there is a place of worship right here amen this is the place B amen from here to here 3 days when you reach here you're not there yet but you can see far off right are we together even if you are under Luther and the Wesley and the Pentecost which is on the seventh day but you still not there yet hallu everybody okay everybody okay everybody okay this part here cause a separation separation between Abraham and his servant are you following me verse five and Abraham said to who his young man do what abide ye here with this is the further you can go if you ask those young men what happened in the first day they will tell you you ask them the second day they will tell you you ask them the third day they will tell you but if you ask them beyond the third day have you noticed that those young men were two that's right did you notice that they were two young man amen have you noticed they were two young men and those two stuck at a certain level but they could not go further have you noticed that because two messenger can go to Sodom [Applause] but the messenger with h only stay with Abraham everybody okay everybody good two Messenger will go to Sodom but they are a messenger stay with Abraham [Applause] alone are we together have I lost anyone have I lost you my friend watch what happened in this part here amen verse uh five and Abraham say to the young man to his young men there were two of them that's what the Bible says aide you here with the water yes everything stays here and I and the what so two people me and Isaac I and Isaac will go Yonder and do what worship so Abraham include Isaac in the worship Isaac was a sacrifice but but Abraham turned Isaac into a worshiper are we together he said me and it will go together and we'll go do what worship and when we worship we'll do what come again to you come again to you so Abraham is saying we are going to and as we going to we will come back to where is Abraham getting this stuff what happened in Abraham in this spot Abraham is saying him and his son will go and come back but Abraham knows that at this point Isaac will be killed everybody okay everybody okay so Abraham at this point released the resurrection that's right slow down put your seat belt listen to this follow me carefully if I can even cross this I will be good the Bible say this is Paul in Hebrew 11 Paul Say by what faith so Abraham was doing things by what faith now you begin to understand that Abraham was not just talking like that he was talking by what faith faith in what because faith faith must have a foundation follow correctly he say by faith Abraham when he was what Tri Paul didn't use the word tempted what is Paul saying Tri did you see Paul saying tempted no so that Temptation was a trial that's it that's it are we together yes sir if you go with me like this we would take too long what up amen what they call tempting was actually trial amen he says Abraham when he was tried no tempted amen offer up Isaac and he that received the promises offer up his only what begotten son do you hear that terminology the only begotten son that's right does he say something it's talking about who Christ Abraham took the wood and put it on Isaac because Jesus Christ will carry [Applause] water brother Bram say when they put the wood on Isaac he was speaking about Jesus carrying the cross because the cross is a wood so do you see what is happening everybody okay everybody good Hallelujah everybody good Verse 18 watch now watch clearly Abraham had a faith because of that Faith Abraham was not afraid to offer up Isaac amen what was in the mind of Abraham what produced that Faith because because when Abraham say me and the Lord we are going and come back Abraham was speaking by faith what was the generator of that Faith this is what Paul is explaining follow me carefully Verse 18 of whom he was what said that in what Isaac shall that seed be what called so when God told Abraham kill Isaac Abraham said wait a minute recently he told me that in Isaac Isaac will have children but Isaac is not grown enough and he want to kill him oh no problem take Isaac let me see how you going to kill him in other word if your purpose is to kill Isaac you must raise him back [Applause] again because what you told me yesterday is going to be a lie but God it's impossible for God to lie when you dealing with God catch him by what he [Applause] says don't be wasting your time in prayer talking talking talking you talk with [Applause] Precision you get him you say do you remember what you say here this is it do you remember what you say here this is it do you remember what you say here in other word you are pushing God back you push him back you push him back you push him back you until God is at the corner you put God to the [Applause] corner Hall word word hallelujah watch this the faith of Abraham here at Point a is based on the promise the promise that was given to Abraham that Isaac will not die without a baby the promise about Isaac producing the seed so Abraham had something to lock God when Abraham look he say oh don't worry let's go let me see him kill you but there is one thing after he finish killing after after I cut your throat I would turn around that say this child need to have a baby he need to be married so you I'm going to say in my word I'm going to say my way you telling God you better you better [Applause] because I didn't say I didn't ask you for the promise you the one that gave me the promise sir and Heaven and Earth will pass away but his [Applause] word church you must change your life you must change your environment you must be tired of [Applause] religion you must see God alive in your life you must see God working in your [Applause] life you're not here to hear testimony on people only you must bring also your testimony today is brother Christ tomorrow is my testimony I am not expectat I am a [Applause] [Music] participator in other word your your your your soul must have some blood that you can testify I kill a Philistine amen amen Point number one that Abraham used is the promise God gave him what is point number two follow me sir you you need to be gracious with me I have not start preaching I'm just reading the scripture this is how I read my Bible verse 19 accounting that God was able to what raise him up do you see why Abraham was thinking about it because God gave me the promise amen God gave me the promise that's why I know God will raise him up that's why Abraham said they chared me wel come back because God gave me the promise he said accounting that God was able to raise him up even from the what the dead do you see what was in the mind of Abraham the promise trck him and say oh Isaac will have a baby don't worry Isaac won't die God will raise him up watch the second gear Abraham used amen watch it he said from W also he receive him in a what figure that's I want you to follow me carefully the first thing uh Abraham used Amen to give him strength in this triy he used the promise of God Amen the second thing Abraham used Abraham used his [Applause] experience when I tell you keep up with the sermon I know what I'm talking about experience give you bread for the moment and he give you the bullet for the future the god that deliver me from The Lion past from the bear past this are ccum stand for the [Applause] present are we together are we together so the second thing Abraham is using Abraham is using his experience his past experience what was the past experience Paul is saying that from W also he did what received him in a figure he receive him him who he receive Isaac in a figure listen to me carefully we clear listen to Paul follow me carefully don't look at the verse on the top go to 19 you ready being not weak in what faith he considered not his own body his own body body how now dead so Abraham was how dead I want you to follow me Abraham in his body dead but Abraham was married to have a baby you need a daddy and the mommy the daddy is declared dead we need to for watch mama if Mama was still alive you ready for me you ready he con not his own body how now dead when he was 100 years old nether yet the what deadness of of who Sarah W so Daddy was how de mama was how dead I love this church mama was also dead everybody okay so Abraham remembered that this boy Isaac receive him as somebody from the [Applause] dead in other word do you follow me do you follow me in other word because Abraham was dead Sarah was dead it was impossible for both of them to have a baby so God have to resurrect Abraham do you follow me God have to change Abraham and Sarah back again to be younger in order to receive the child so Isaac was a product of the [Applause] Resurrection hallu hallu can I drop something you will swallow it are you sure you will swallow it if Isaac was the first begotten of Abraham from the [Applause] dead so when when Abraham died and resurrected the first begotten from the dead was [Applause] Isaac are we together are we together so when the trial came Abraham stop and say wait a minute this boy the way I receive him I receive him as somebody who was dead and Was Made Alive that's why I receive him to begin with and number two recently God told me this boy will have baby sir so Abraham has two feet now yes sir of he said you know what me and the child we going back we come [Applause] back in other word if God could Raise Me Up he will raise this boy up and M fact he also gave a promise that this boy will have children everybody okay everybody good these two things right here makes the faith of Abraham everybody good now I'm going to climb up again you ready this faith is only the first level of faith of Abraham this Faith here happened on point a he Tau the servant that I will go and come back amen Abraham have not spoke about the real yet that's that's on point a do you follow me do you follow me do you follow me faith in the promise of God and faith in the past experience of the resur of the power of Resurrection do you know when Paul was in the in the in in the boat do you know what gave Paul Faith yes sir do you know do you know what gave Paul Faith do you know how Paul overcome the member because God told Paul you going to meet Cesar when God say that Paul knew that there is nothing that's going to block him until he sees season brother Bram said that's why when he jum in the Isen and the snake pick him up he look at the snake he said do you see Caesar around here do you see do you see my face as Caesar I have not met Cesar [Applause] yet everybody okay everybody okay in other way he he said you it's face Cesar you don't know the identity of people go to the fire and the Bible say he continue picking up stuff in other way it's a distraction it was no longer a trial he was a [Applause] [Music] distraction why a distraction because God say so because God told me Caesar and Paul say I must know him and the power of what in other word this Faith here is the faith of Paul Hallelujah everybody okay that's why brought the BR and before the seals he says I preach like Paul amen I have a question can I ask you a question where did Paul create something so so we need to go beyond the third day we need to step beyond the third day the faith of Paul is good we can hold on to the promise we can bring Resurrection but there is [Applause] more Have I Lost somebody hold me tight my friend everybody good I'm still turning the corner W in other word can I continue Abraham has two Gars of faith in the first gear of faith of Abraham he can use his past experience and he locks God or he can take a promise of God and he lcks God but this temp a God wanted to bring the true Abraham out we clear are we together are we together let's go to verse six father help me you need to be gracious to me I'm just reading the Bible verse 6 and Abraham took the wood of the burn offering and did what laid it upon Isaac he put the cross on Isaac and he took the what the fire judgment in his hand that's verse six and a knife I don't want to get into those detail because all of that have meaning I'm trying to stay away because if I dig in the detail we lost we're going to lose our GPS right here because Abraham is a prophet the prophet is pushing the son toward the cross I'm I'm leaving that alone there is more stuff in here let's let's stay on the highway okay there is too many Billboard so let me stay on the highway amen but uh uh verse uh n and they went both of them together so at this point Abraham and Isaac are going along the servant are behind the servant heard the faith of Abraham let me drop this the servant and Abraham heard the same to preach about the resurrection all of us can preach [Music] it to hold on to the promise of God everybody can do that there is no difference the difference is beyond [Applause] that Pentecost can pray for the sick and they will get result that's that's not the problem let's go beyond that can I continue now watch verse seven and Isaac spoke to Abraham this is the first time we hear the voice of Isaac sir his father and say my father now remember he's included as a worshipper Abraham has his sacrifice he sacrific is Isaac but Isaac is looking me and my father we are going to worship but where is the sacrifice so Isaac doesn't have a sacrifice amen but Abraham has a sacrifice are we together Abraham sacrifices Isaac but Isaac doesn't know he's a sacrifice so he need a sacrifice because he is a worshiper are we together have I lost you you want me to repeat again Isaac is a worshiper the will go to worship a worshiper must have a sacrifice Abraham in his mind he knows what the sacrifice is the sacrifice is Isaac but Isaac as a worshiper need a sacrifice so what Abraham spoke trigger something can I continue and Isaac verse S spoke to Abraham his father and said my father and he said here I am just like God called Abraham my son and he said behold the what the fire and the water the wood but where is the Lamb for a burnt what offering Abraham now have just finished his faith he laid his faith down he says the lad and me will come down and Paul told us that the way he laid that faith is that God gave me a promise and God also delivered me so everything is okay so now Abraham is resting on that Faith to move toward the mountain now Isaac squeeze Abraham [Applause] again Abraham say now boy what else can I produce again [Music] here in other words I already have faith to handle this deal the deal is me and you will go but you won't die my son if you die God will raise you up we coming back that's it let's go stay quiet God says no God pull Isaac he said push something on Abraham because Abraham need to use the second gear are we together are we together watch now verse eight and Abraham said my son God will do what provide himself a lamb for what a burnt offering so they went both to both of them how together God will provide himself a lamb was a lamb there when you say God will provide it means something is not there is everybody okay so in this Faith Abraham begin to call things that do not exist sir yes sir hallah [Music] everybody good everybody good everybody good the second gear of Abraham is Abraham when you push him too hard he will begin to call [Applause] things [Music] everybody good everybody good have I lost anyone so the second gear be of Abraham is calling things that are not that do not exist everybody clear into existence amen hallelujah do you follow me so depending on which pressure come on Abraham if it's another pressure he can use the promise of God and he get by with it if it's another pressure he can push his experience using the bullet again but if you squeeze Abraham too much Abraham will be God [Music] [Applause] do you follow me do you follow me this type of faith that that come up in this area is a faith that works good with [Applause] pressure in other word when you bring pressure in that faith it is like fuel it's a great ingredient it makes that Faith work quickly that's why brother Bram say wait for the pressure of the ecal move and watch the [Applause] third so when Rome is squeezing squeezing it is just pushing you to a different [Music] [Applause] gear Have I Lost somebody am where do you get this two faith of Abraham watch now Roman 4:17 let's go up to 177lu you there watch as it is written I have made the what of what before him let me go here okay before him go ahead my brother whom he believe whom he believe faith he believe what even God God who does what quickeneth the dead stop a God who quickened the dead that's Abraham that's his first gear amen watch the second gear then and cth those things which be as not as though they were do you see that Abraham can use the quickening power of God or he can call things into existence depending on how you push him are we together are we together are we together are we together so your trial is not really a [Applause] [Music] trial I don't know if I Will preaching Hallelujah 1 Corinthians 10:3 the Bible says what Paul there has no what temptation taken you but such as is what Comming to man but God is how faithful who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are what able follow me carefully but will with the what Temptation in other word when God bring a temptation to you God put something to that Temptation yes sir are we reading the same Bible with the Temptation he does what also make a way to escape that what may be able to Bear it so when God bring a trial to you that trial cannot come without a way of [Applause] Escape I don't know if you get me any trial that come in your life if you sit quiet you will see an [Applause] exit God never bring you into a trial to lock you up the trial when he comes he comes with pressure but if you look in that pressure you will see a door wide [Applause] open amen that's why Peter say that they trial of what your faith is what being much more precious than of gold gold that do what perishes your trial is much precious than gold because without this Trier the gears of Abraham won't be [Music] activated so the trial that come to you is just to exercise your faith to to to make you discover Who You Are because when there is no trial no exercise everybody good everybody good let's go to the thron of me 7 two father help me you know what let's pray because this is getting different Heavenly Father Lord we are committing oursel unto thy hand father we thank you for your presence and we committing this service may you be the Alpha and the Omega may you move me completely out of the way father speak to our soul and bless us today in the name of Jesus Christ amen Deuteronomy 2 if you there you can say amen amen two I was trying to read till 14 I cut down on eight I say so I can do it quickly so we can move on but now it's slowing now theonomy 2 verse1 you thereare you can say Amen then we turned and took our journey into the Wilderness by the way of the Red Sea as the Lord spoke to me and we Compass what Mount SE how many days many days and the Lord spoke to me saying you have Compass this Mountain what long enough in other way you have been playing in around this area too long that's why I'm going to turn the corner everybody okay everybody okay you have been playing around in this

mountain long enough turn you how northward northward and command you the people saying you are to pass through the coast of your brethren not hidden so when you have been going around going around going around going around in the message God come he say push a break youve been playing around too much like this now you need to move forward but remember as you begin to move forward you're going to start passing your [Laughter] brethren H don't start a fight yet everybody okay you won't you won't pass the Sinners the Breen in other word as you begin to progress your brother will begin to remain there but you are continuing he says as you your brother who the children of Esau do you know Esau came from who so God is talking to Jacob and he's telling Jacob when you begin to move forward you're going to pass Esau pass even though you brother I won't say something I'm going to let brother Bram say it amen he says which dwell in s there shall be a of you let me leave it alone they will say I'm talking about as let me leave it alone because God has been doing something in Israel and everybody around is [Applause] afraid so when they see you sometime they start shooting dark [Applause] [Music] there is nobody that is bigger than anyone did I tell you that I'm bigger than you you are afraid you are [Applause] afraid you will hear in this in this message we are still the same knowing doesn't mean you have something what is wrong who who for you to know the message you know why you talking like [Applause] that you got faith on who I [Applause] am there's no big eye

you begin to hear that don't trample them leave them alone can I continue m not with them for I will not give you the what in other way don't go in fight with them that's not your battle remember continue North word keep moving [Applause] forward he says I will not give you the land no not so much as a what a foot breath even a little bit because I have given my ha to who es for what a possession you shall buy what meat of what them for what money that you may eat and you shall also buy what water of them for what money that you may what drink in other way don't owe them [Applause] anything if they want to give it for free say no get the money because I don't want you to talk tomorrow and you say I am the one that help Abraham no no no no sir hallu no sir we don't need that

you you have lacked what nothing remember after 40 years Israel lack what nothing but God was not satisfied with them staying there am in other way even though you seen God this is not the promised land you need to move forward in the wilderness I give you water in the wilderness I give you Mana but that's not my my my my plan these are the temporary things to help you move on what does this mean [Applause] I don't know if I need to get in my subject listen what brother Bram say brother Bram say listen man don't you make the same mistake your what Fathers Day or you will be here what 40 years see see where the Christian men what organization and so forth and Christian what men what were they doing they were fasing in the wilderness that's right that's EXA rightly in other word we grew up in this message with a lot of fighting all the time around the preachers don't do that don't argue with nobody don't get on the chat begin to argue this is not argue time this is moving forward [Applause] time it can I continue can I continue oh God he says if you ever organize it you shall do what stuck right here you shall stick right here in other what 40 years but it's time that God is calling the church to what move [Applause] up I believe that notice he said now as you go by what Mount sear there is your what denominational brother who Esau doing what setting up there a good what Presbyterian not a bad one a good what Presbyterian and what Methodist and what or Baptist let me say this this way those denomination are in the message [Music] [Applause] ring they are no longer outside the way certain Message Church behave they are like Baptist Methodist Presbyterian they are good good Presbyterian but don't fast with [Music] them let me ask you a question what is a Baptist today going to do to you can a Baptist give you trouble who give you trouble the people in the message who stumble your life the people in the message who tell lies and you are the people in the message who sleep with the sister in the church the people in the message who act like politician the people in the message but there is a crop that won't do that Hall we are moving forward huj H

Revival he came out of the same Revival that you did because Esau and Jacob came from the same parent [Applause] this bride has a Revival but this bride produce [Applause] twins are we together are we

anything do what you pay him for it if you drink any water do what pay it for it don't touch the borderline believer [Applause] [Music] do you know what border line means do you know a border land means what it means they can come as close to the prod but they don't want to bite the [Applause] stuff they cannot go with the further part of the word they want to stay around the body listen to brother Bram he says because I will not bless you in it don't do what beat him anymore just do what pass by quietly if the Methodist and the Baptist live up there at the what borderline every Revival ever come for produce what swings I don't care where it is that it produce what Twins and the bride Revival have twins so what God is saying today is we have been around the lot is house we've been compassing this mountain too much let's get out of this environment even though we have the manner even though we have the water but the promised land is not there yet we need to move up everybody clear everybody clear let's go to 2 Corinthians 4 Jesus Lord help me this is not the time to fast you come with fasting I don't give you a quote you go search it yourself I don't give people quote to fast I give people quote for quote to move them life up with God you want to build your organization go ahead and build it not me the time is treacherous God is coming we need to prepare the Brad to go home no time for popularity let's go to 2 Corinthians 4 verse 13 amen we have the same Spirit of what faith according as it is written we believe and therefore I have spoken we have I spoken we also believe and therefore we do [Music] what I'm doing good my subject this [Applause] morning Shake somebody's [Applause] hand [Applause] [Applause] yes you ready are you ready if you fool we stay and we come back are you ready my subject this morning is the four phases of rof claming toward great [Applause] faith claming toward what great in other word we are moving up everybody okay everybody good yes sir last Sunday we establish that faith has category yes sir we found out that faith has measure everybody okay which talk about the first Faith which was leer faith I told you I'm going to pick you up wherever you are little faith we found out that he was fearful little faith worries too much about the moral L of Faith forgot the past experience that God did for him but still L of Faith Can Walk on Water you remember that Peter walk on water with FL of faith yes sir L of Faith Can Walk on Water amen then we spoke about the great faith amen amen we found out that great faith worry about the spoken word speak the word only it's only about the spoken word amen great faith have no problem with distance amen great faith can pull something closer or push it away because the Roman Centurion say if I say come you come go you go so the faith can push something and pull it it can push up everybody okay this Faith need no prayer you don't cast out devil amen everybody okay you don't lay the hand on the sick everybody okay it's a faith that rely on Authority and that Authority is knowing who you are everybody okay it is a faith that says the right thing can I continue it is all so a faith that teaches [Music] God I let you swall that when the Roman Centurion came to Jesus amen he said have mercy on me my servant is over there sick Jesus say I will go do you follow me yes sir brother Bram said Jesus was going to lay hand on the servant Hallelujah and the Roman Centon stop [Applause] Jesus he said you don't have to come don't waste your money to take a Uber I don't need your presence in my house because I'm unworthy all I need is speak the word it's a faith that tell God what to [Applause] do everybody good Have I Lost somebody have I lost someone have I lost someone amen we found this Faith happened in men the Roman Centurion you remember and he also raen on a woman which is the SAR phenician so this faith can happen to everybody everybody okay in the sorrow phenician Woman Jesus told her that you are a dog I don't take the stuff of the children and give it to dog and the woman begin to leure Jesus am I saying something different the woman begin to give Jesus a lesson he say what you say is true but let me teach you something when the food come the food is not only for the children the food have a provided way for the dog in the [Applause] house are you following me because brother Bram said dog is the only animal that live with human being so dog depend on the food of the human being and the woman say if you notice whenever the children are eating crms fell down amen and that's what the dogs need Jesus pushed the break hallelujah hallelujah he said woman great is thy faith for what you have said for the lecture you gave me Jus if you struggling let me load this one again one day God wanted to destroy [Applause] Israel and God told Moses move out of the way let me destroy Israel Moses told God chill out come here let me teach you something do you know what you did to these people you don't see who is around here do you know what you can cause trouble today and God was sitting watching Moses and when Moses finished God look he say you are [Applause] right and brother Bram lost the GPS and brother Bram say how can a man correct [Applause] God everybody okay everybody good and brother Bram say he was Crist in Moses that's why brother Bram say your inward man is God it is God beling his own [Applause] wordu I'm going to leave Jacob alone because Jacob could hold to the Angel and the angel don't go nowhere it everybody good everybody good so it's a faith that teaches God what to do God didn't say I'm going to provide a lamb it was Abraham telling God you need to provide a lamb for yourself you heard the boys the way he's saying so you better provide a lamb for [Applause] yourself you need to know who you are [Applause] it is written in your low year [Applause] Gods you are the children of God ye are [Applause] Gods everybody good everybody good have I lost anyone yes so we got little faith we got great faith brother Steven sometime I struggle that's right it looks like I don't have faith that's right yes sir I told you I'm going to pick you up where you are third category faithless no faith let me pick you up where you are everybody okay everybody okay go to Mark 9 glory to God Mark chapter 9 oh God help me out like josa we need to speak to the time sir and hold the time tell everybody hold on we still having a good time here you there sir Ro uh Mark chapter 9 verse 17 if you there you can say amen amen I'm trying to pick you up where you are if you have little faith great faith or no faith let's pick you up because if I continue with faith somebody say I don't even have faith I feel like I can't even believe anything let me pick you up amen verse 17 if you there you can say amen amen and one of the multitude answered and said master I have brought to you my son which has a what a dumb spirit and wherever he takes him he tears him and for and he form and Nash with his Thief epilepsy and P away amen and I spoke to your disciple that they should cast him out and they could not he answer him and said oh what faithless generation a generation no faith but what is the solution amen he says how long shall I be with you how long shall I suffer you bring him who unto me so he's moving from the one that doesn't have faith to the one that have faith the Bible says and they brought him to and they brought him to him and when he saw him immediately the spirit tore him and he felt on he fell on the ground and wallow form him and he asked his father how long is it ago since this came to him and he said of a child he started when he was a child and often he has cast him into the fire and into the waters to destroy him but if you can do anything have compassion on us and do what help us are we clear people without faith Jesus said to him if you can believe you there all things are possible to him that do what believe it Jesus told the man I can do it but to do it I need your faith that's it amen I'm reading the Bible I'm I'm ready to do it I'm more than able to do it but in order to dispatch the power from me into your solution or your problem I need [Music] Faith amen this man look at him Jesus already said they don't have faith what do you do you there verse 21 im 24 and immediately the father of the child did what cried out and say with what tears Lord what I believe do what help thou my unbelief so even if you don't have faith even if you don't have faith God is there to help your faith up I'm reading the Bible Jesus told them generation with our faith Jesus say if you want me to do this you need to have faith the man pray he say father I am believing but I want you to help my unbelief in other word even if there is not faith if you are willing for God to help you God will help you have faith and this child was delivered everybody okay so without faith means there is unbelief there everybody clear let's go to the Book of John glory to God John chapter 20 l Faith great faith no faith the levels of Faith then we see how you climb up you there are you there amen John chapter 20 verse 24 if you there you can say Amen myot you there amen praise God let's go but Thomas one of the 12 called who dius was not with them when Jesus came he miss a service and he begin to hear people telling him oh my God the anointing fell down you miss you should have been in church brother Thomas was not there amen they are the disciple therefore say to him we have seen the Lord but he said to them except I shall see in his hands the what the print of the nails and put my finger into what the print of the nails Thomas have a problem here his problem is he need he need to see and to touch it's a faith limited to the [Applause] senses are we together except at tou and attach the print and put my finger into the nail and trust my hand into his side I what will not believe in other words I have zero belief to what you're saying the only way I can believe I must see and I must touch if I see and I touch then Thomas have faith as long as Thomas didn't touch didn't see he doesn't have faith it looks like Thomas live in Missouri whoever put me on Tik Tok don't put me before the statement I am not saying everybody that live in Missouri don't have faith but I'm going to C brother Branham so put this whole part on Tik Tok brother Bram say we are so close to what Missouri that is the show M State say amen [Applause] [Music] amen everybody okay everybody okay they say seeing is what believing you have heard that haven't you and how many of you heard that all saying let me see how foolish that is right am are we together are we together are we together now you can put on Tik Tok let's continue verse 26 amen and after 8 days again his disciple were with him and Thomas with them now Thomas is in church amen then came Jesus the door being how shut so when we shut the door here and we start service that's not a problem for God he can even enter right here he doesn't need the door open let me continue he says the door being shut and stood in the midst he said Peace be to you then say he to whom why didn't he go straight only to [Music] Thomas so if you are struggling with faith Jesus sees you if you don't have no faith as long as you are part of the elect God sees your need God knows that you don't have faith and God will do everything he can in order to quank the faith in [Applause] you everybody okay if you are great faith that lead the faith we need clamp up no faith don't be discouraged God is there as long as you part of the elect everybody okay now watch watch Thomas watch Jesus turning on the car of Thomas so that Thomas can have faith amen the other one say help my unbelief watch what he says verse 27 then say he to Thomas which he your what thy finger exactly what Thomas asked because Thomas is an elect God will do whatever he can to crank that faith in you if this is what you need need to be to have faith I'm going to provide it amen he says put your finger and behold my hand and which he your hand because when Jesus appeared Thomas already so so the first part is already covered but Thomas say even if I see I need to do what that's why Jesus said now move to the next one come and touch so I must make sure your faith is there before I go everybody okay and he said reach out he your hand and Trust into my son and be not what faithless be not what faithless so Thomas didn't have faith Thomas was faithless but Jesus can put a faith even when you are faithless everybody okay he said and Thomas and he said be not faithless but do what believ him watch when Jesus Crank that engine look at get the faith that Thomas have verse 26 and Thomas answered and said to him my Lord and my God Thomas recognized Jesus Christ now as a Lord and as a God so Thomas received the revelation of the deity of Jesus [Applause] Christ Jesus gave him a personal re of himself now Thomas knows that Jesus is just not a man he is Elohim he is God the Mighty God the Everlasting father this is the man Jesus Christ even if you don't have faith when you are stuck in the corner don't keep quiet tell god father help my unbelief in other word Lord run out my batter is low I need some charging amen I want you to help me up because I must be honest with you I don't believe this thing will happen but I'm not going to stay there help me believe [Applause] it everybody C so far everybody C so far so we have established leader Faith great faith faithless all of them God can help with it amen can we climb up in faith sir can we let's go to Luke 17 oh God if you notice I have not touched any Luke 17 if you there you can say Amen are you there Luke 17 verse 5 if I pass this thank God if I can pass this I will try amen verse five you there are you there the Apostle say to the Lord am I reading a different Bible am I reading a different Bible Professor we together ah the Apostle say to the Lord do what increase our faith do you see how the Bible is a new book you read this before but when we reading it now it look like something new because of the anointing of the [Applause] seals hallu it become like a new book because of the presence of the Lord Jesus say the apostles say Lord do what increase our faith so the Apostle realized their faith is low thank you Lord some faithless some lead a faith they realize that what Jesus have they don't have it they say father we see you operating but the way we shoot it looks like our gun is different than your gun can you upgrade can you upgrade our telephone can you upgrade software because your speed is too quick our speed is still spinning spinning spinning spinning I have to restart the internet again yours works quickly can you update I'm going this way so the younger generation can pick it up everybody okay can you increase our faith everybody want to know the answer glory to God [Laughter] can I continue father help me he says the Apostle say to the Lord increase our faith and the Lord [Applause] say the way they were they were expecting they were expecting Jesus to say oh wait a minute Thomas which level two Peter this one Jesus didn't do that and if you notice Jesus doesn't answer the question Jesus begin to say something verse six and the Lord say if you had Faith as a grain of what Mustard Seed we already know our faith is little this is not what we ask you what we ask you is take our faith pushes up you begin to tell us what our faith is now Jesus goes instead of saying yes when you receive this I'm going to increase your faith tomorrow I'm going to increase your faith Jesus doesn't say that Jesus turn and begin to say something what is Jesus saying Jesus say that if you have a faith as what a mustard seed what is this meaning what does it mean tighten up if you have faith as a grain of Master seed you must say to this siot tree be you plugged up by the root and be you planted in the sea and he should do what obey you remember Peter with a load of Faith walk in the water and Jesus also walk in the water but Jesus and Peter have different Faith but Peter they walk inward you following me Jesus is saying if you have a faith like this mastered seed you can say to something move and do this and it's going to happen in other words you can speak the word ah brother stepen I thought speaking the word you need to have a big great faith before we move forward we need to know what is a mastered seat let's go to Matthew 17 Lord help me if you there you can say Amen Matthew 17 verse 21 let's get this you there verse 20 and verse 20 uh verse 20 I'm sorry you there Matthew chapter 17 verse 20 you there the Bible say Jesus said to them because of your what unbelief for verily I say to you if you have what faith as a grain of what mustard seed you shall say to this mountain speak to the mountain for a mustard seed to this mountain remove here to Yonder place and it shall in it shall remove and nothing shall be impossible what unto you if your faith is like a grain of mustard nothing will be impossible to you nothing impossible if your faith is like a little Mustard Seed so why do we need great faith then if little faith can do everything why do we need great faith let's go to Matthew 13 and I'm going to see where I'm going to go Matthew 13:31 follow me carefully now if I can clam this amen you there another Parable put he forth to them saying the kingdom of what heaven is like to a grain of what mustard come which a man did what took and do what sold in his field we need to know what a master seed is now Backle up my friend verse 32 which indeed is the what least of all seeds stop so a mastered seed is the smallest of every seed According To Jesus Christ I'm using the Bible Hallelujah so when they ask Jesus increase our faith Jesus look at them he went to the smallest of all Faith he said you see the little little little little little little the kinding of garden Faith you see this kinding of garden faith if you have this kinding of garden faith is you see that mountain you with a kindergarten faith can move that mountain let's go slowly so a master seed is the smallest of all seed this is Jesus himself explaining in red verse 32 which indeed is the least of all seed Kama but when it is what grown so the master seed does remain Master seed church are we together if you tired I stop they asked Jesus increase our faith Jesus went to the elementary he went to kindergarden he say if you have a Faith Like a What mastery and Jesus now is explaining that a master seed is first of all the smallest of the faith but when you put it it doesn't stay small that faith will [Applause] grow everybody okay one makes a tree grow hallu come on what makes a tree grow water so if the faith is already there and the watching of the word bite the word the Bible say the washing of the word b the what word so if the word is continuing to come on the master seed the master seed won't Remain the smallest seed it will begin to do what grow that's why brother Steven say read the Cod read the church ages read the seals read the 70 weeks of Daniel put your head in the master because your faith need to [Applause] grow are we together are we together follow me he says oh God help me when he will begin to grow amen he says when it begin to grow it is grown K it is the what greatest thank you Lord am when he start he was a what the word Jesus used smallest but when he grow it is the what greatest so the great is already in the small can I continue can I continue if I begin to pull brother Bram now it's a problem everybody okay he says and when he goes he becomes the what greatest among her so he mov from the smallest to the whoever is praying for me to stop don't worry I'm going to stop your prayer will be answered soon everybody okay everybody okay he says he says it is the greatest among what hers and become a what tree when it's the greatest it becomes a tree amen it become a tree come so that the what birds of the air come and do what large in the branches [Music] thereof I'm going to drop this because I don't have time if you go to the Book of Daniel nebuchad had a dream of a big tree with bird and everything on it and God gave the interpretation that it's the greatness of the kingdom of Nebuchadnezzar which was a golden Kingdom everybody okay everybody okay and then the Beast and everything can come under it so that faith that you want to increase instead of Jesus telling them that hey here is the key get the key crank up you thereare Jesus said no no no no no no if you have a Faith Like a What because every faith comes from God no matter how leader it is every faith come from God so God cannot ignore your faith no matter how little it is amen my God I don't know how this kept moving here it is Hebrew 12:2 the Bible say looking unto who Jesus the what author and and the Finish he's the author and the what finisher so the one who the faith that you have is Jesus so there is no way Jesus can be lead anybody's Faith because Faith come from him the Bible say faith is a gift of God in Ephesians 28 the Bible say faith cometh by what hearing hearing what the word so the word of God produce Faith so no matter which level you are God is there to pick you up everybody okay everybody okay but to grow all you need to do is the lot of faith that you have there Jesus said if you put it on the ground you continue to water it that faith will begin to grow when he grow he become a greatest of all herb until even the bird begin to come and then sit on it what used to be big like this one day we'll become a big J everybody okay everybody okay so far everybody good everybody good listen to what brother brandham say then I have to stop brother Bram this is the first quote on everything I put in some people has what great big Faith like this anything can what happen I told you faith is in proportion in measure and everything I told you all of that I didn't give you any quote now brother Bram is speaking the authoriz mouth peace of God for this age now he's talking and when he talk I say amen amen some people has great big Faith like what this anything can what happen the next has a faith that deep it takes a little longer next has fath that deep takes a quite a little while some has Faith Like a What Mustard Seed but if it's Master Seed Faith let's go my brother genuine Faith hold on to it I'm picking you up where you are my friend hold on to it just keep watching believing it it shall become a what marble Faith then it will become a what grapefruit fa then it will become what mountain faith it shall bring you right out uh-huh just the same with it [Applause] amen because a master seed will grow he might be a master seed today if you give it more water tomorrow you find out that begin to grow amen and he begin to push the mountain a little [Applause] bit yes sir amen he says he become a marble Faith then he become a great fruit Faith then he become a mountain faith it shall bring you right out if you just stay with it hold on to it it shall bring you right out to the water if you stay with it but don't be what discouraged and do not believe what symptom symptom that is what the devil's [Applause] lie so what I'm saying is when they pray for you and if your faith is not where it's supposed to be it doesn't mean you don't have faith because if you come for prayer it means you already have faith but your faith might not be where it's supposed to be but hold on to that M continue to believe continue to believe continue to believe as it's growing up brother Bram say watch out for symptoms because symptom want to discourage you because you don't have the result yet but if you focus on the faith the the seed will grow he will take care of your [Applause] problem I'm almost there my friend listen to brother Bram the only thing she has to do is to do what accept it according to her what faith it shall be to her if she believe how spontaneously right now great faith over what her head she can she shall go right on be what healed here if she believe that much he might take her what two or what few weeks to get well I am helping you my friend because we want if we be praying for something happen even if it doesn't happen it could be according to your faith it doesn't mean you don't have faith you need to know how to fight the devil even if I'm going home but the symptom is still there I have faith and I'm going to hold on the faith that they pray for [Applause] me I'm going this way until the spoken until we reach the spoken word brother Bram say it might take two or few weeks to get well if she's done to a what Mustard Seed if she just have that kind of Faith do what hold on to it it shall bring you right out of the light just stay with it believe it and do what testify of and do what confess [Music] [Applause] it let me go let's start again if you have a master seed Fai in other word if you are the lowest in this church in faith if you have faithless like Thomas God will crank you if you are the lowest in faith in this church don't worry brother Bram is giving us how to make the master seed grow what do you do to the master seed believe it and do what testify of it and do what confess it and God will do what bring it to pass so when you are confessing and professing and testifying you are actually putting water am on the seed [Applause] everybody okay everybody okay have you seen a baby did you see a baby a baby just eat and the change diaper eat and the change diaper but after a while you will see the baby begin to flip and you want to say hey this is the first time she's flipping one day you see she begin to crawl you don't know when changes happen because you keep giving milk as long as mil enter development will [Applause] enter so maybe today you not where you are don't be discouraged keep drinking the milk keep eating the word keep confessing keep moving up keep testifying before you know it the god of Abraham the god of Jacob the god of William Marion Bram the God of this message will vindicate [Applause] you I can't touch this my friend oh my God I can't touch this my friend let me see if I can get this oh my God oh my God let me touch this I will come back to the other next time time and land the ship brother Bram say understand now the angel of God sometime when a blessing is pronounced upon you he may not be that he can't get to you right [Music] then it may not be that he can he may not be that he can get to you right then it might not just not it might not be just instant what healing but as you believe your faith will make you how some people has what spontaneous Faith what great faith how that de that is a what a miracle some of them have faith about what that de it shall just take a little while some has Master Seed Faith very leader but just stay with it he shall do what bring you out and brother Bram say sometime when you pray for the angel of

sees you if it's a faith it comes from God God honors Faith amen but if it doesn't happen it doesn't mean God didn't heal you everybody okay it means you might be in a different level of Faith don't

if you got that much Faith why don't you just give it over into the hand of Jesus and he shall feed thousands there is no much in your hand but once in his hand then he shall do what miracle if you let the faith get into his what that little faith that woke you up this morning and say I'm taking you to church take that Faith this morning put it in the hand of Jesus Christ Peter with a little faith Walk On The Water even if you struggle like Peter Jesus will reach you up there in other word what I'm saying whichever Faith you have that faith can make things happen even though we moving forward toward the great faith don't be discouraged where you are now you know how to grow yes sir you know how to make your faith grow begin to give it more worthy give it more word so the faith will begin to grow and it will become a great tree let's pray Heavenly Father Lord we are approaching you humbly this afternoon father once again we thank you for your grace we thank you for your love we thank you for your mercy and we thank you for everything you have been doing for us thank you Lord father you pick us up again in whichever level that we are whether we don't have faith you the god of Thomas you're the god that help our unbelief you the god that can lower yourself to the very place that we are to make sure that we don't lack Faith even though you told Thomas that blessed are they that do not see but believe in other words this is where Thomas you need to go but I can jop down here to pick you up Lord but even though that I pick you up this is not the level I want you to stay you need to get to the level where you don't see but you still believe father each person here you know their heart you know the level of their faith you know what they have and maybe they're struggling with something maybe they're fighting over against something maybe they have been praying for something for so long and nothing is happening thank you Lord and they expecting to have such a great faith or maybe they wonder if brother Bram was here we would have went to Brother branam and ask him a question and say why is such and such in my life why is this now moving why is this happening but father the same God that was with William Marion Branham is with us this morning and that God have spoken to us that if we have a faith like a master SE Hallelujah you went not to the preach kallu you didn't go even into the first or second grade but you went to K the garden yes you say if you even have a kindergarten if you are at the starting point yes if you hold on to that Faith you can receive the same result because all Faith come from you you are the author and you are the finisher of our faith if you ignite a faith in the heart of someone you will finish that faith because you started you're going to finish it father I pray whichever your children are that father you help them Lord give them that Grace for them to testify for them to move on for them to confess for them to stay with it for them to focus on the ray of light and don't look at symptoms and keep holding on knowing that that God somehow you will bring me out of this situation because you did it
