[0:00] not me you never turn me down you turn
[0:02] him
[0:02] down not me because you said I don't
[0:05] believe in such the word says
[0:08] such there you are blind Pharisees they
[0:11] can discern communism discern all these
[0:14] things but the hour they're living in
[0:16] they can't discern it that's exactly
[0:18] right now it's about to reach its my
[0:22] final goal Again The crucial hour here
[0:25] again what is it
[0:28] crucify we'll make with we can't all
[0:30] make them all Methodist we can't make
[0:31] them all Baptist we can't make them all
[0:33] Oneness we can't make them all Trinity
[0:34] we can't make them all this side of the
[0:36] other but we can have a c where you
[0:39] disagree as far as the East is from the
[0:40] west and the whole thing's wrong it's a
[0:43] satellite to Rome exactly right now as
[0:46] an individual I'm going to ask you what
[0:49] will you do with this anointed word
[0:51] which is the Christ the word that was
[0:53] promised for this you as an individual
[0:56] pilot never got it off his hands you
[0:57] know that he screamed cried and
[0:59] everything scheme he could do he failed
[1:01] to do it there's a legend up in
[1:03] switzland there where green blue water
[1:06] washes up where he committed suicide you
[1:07] know the history of it he finally
[1:09] running crazy and he committed suicide
[1:12] why didn't he repent he couldn't
[1:14] repent no more than Esau could repent he
[1:17] had done it don't you let that happen to
[1:22] you he's on your
[1:25] hands The Works is done the Bible's
[1:28] preached the Holy Ghost has identified
[1:30] fed and he sinful man Dare You To Say It
[1:34] Isn't So the Holy Ghost in This last
[1:36] days and the words that's been spoke
[1:38] said it would come to pass and here it
[1:40] is right before us don't try to do it
[1:43] don't let your end be like pilate no he
[1:45] should have accepted him in his heart
[1:47] that's the only way you can get him off
[1:49] your hands is take him in your heart oh
[1:51] don't make that same mistake listen
[1:53] Hebrews 10 says this if we sin
[1:57] willfully disbelieve willfully After we
[2:00] receive the knowledge of the truth there
[2:03] remaineth no more sacrifice for
[2:06] sin if you sin willfully after it's been
[2:09] identified to you and then you turn it
[2:11] down you are
[2:14] absolutely no chance of ever repenting
[2:18] just a moment a note here I want to
[2:20] bring to you before closing like this on
[2:24] the road to the promised land there was
[2:27] in an exodus coming out of Egypt come
[2:30] out by a promised word of God God made

[2:35] down there he was identified that he was
[2:37] a God to bring him out under the
[2:38] conditions that he would promis to the I
[2:41] am when they come to the B land ktie
[2:44] spia the great mistake they made when
[2:46] they got to the land and looked over
[2:48] into the promised land they said we
[2:50] can't take
[2:51] it what was the other 10 they looked at
[2:55] the circumstances their PR they would
[2:57] lose we grasshoppers through the of but

[3:03] back to the word of the Lord said I've
[3:05] give you this land it's a good land p
[3:08] with milk and honey they didn't count
[3:10] what it looked like what was what this
[3:12] evidence was God's word said I'll give

[1:01:59] met on the hall I meet on the hallway
[1:02:02] what are you going to
[1:02:05] do
[1:02:09] bye-bye what about if the police officer
[1:02:12] turn around and say I gave you a
[1:02:16] ticket and it's already been
[1:02:19] dismissed by the judge who do you listen
[1:02:22] to the judge do you pay attention to the
[1:02:24] police officer no sir but what about if
[1:02:26] you coming out and your friend say you
[1:02:28] got a ticket you would say go search my
[1:02:31] record my ticket has already been
[1:02:34] discharged completely everything is gone
[1:02:36] amen so you need to pick or to choose
[1:02:39] who do you want to
[1:02:43] listen amen amen because your judge is
[1:02:46] also your lawyer amen everybody clear so
[1:02:48] far am jump to verse 6 and verse 6 say I
[1:02:53] have
[1:02:54] said ye are God Amen and all of you are
[1:03:00] children of the most high we found out
[1:03:03] that in verse 6 he was talking about a
[1:03:05] Divine
[1:03:07] record now we clear on that one which we
[1:03:11] call it's a
[1:03:13] book
[1:03:17] amen spoken word anyway we got used to
[1:03:21] each other amen amen it's a book are we
[1:03:25] together and this book is without any
[1:03:29] fault it's
[1:03:31] faultless Amen am it's a clean
[1:03:34] record and it's a record that has power
[1:03:38] amen amen amen if you bring this record
[1:03:41] even the dev BS up amen amen amen
[1:03:45] because this record say who can convince
[1:03:47] me of sin
[1:03:51] amen amen amen so when you fight the
[1:03:54] devil you need to know which record you
[1:03:56] using
[1:03:57] amen and even when you approaching God
[1:04:01] you need to know which record you
[1:04:02] approaching god with amen
[1:04:05] am are we together amen are we together
[1:04:09] amen are we together amen because if you
[1:04:12] approach God as a
[1:04:13] criminal you will be
[1:04:16] complexed and even the way you talk is
[1:04:18] different but if you are B but if you
[1:04:22] approach him with
[1:04:23] boldness knowing that when I'm
[1:04:25] approaching him I am not what I'm
[1:04:28] thinking I
[1:04:30] am but I am what he says I am I don't
[1:04:34] know if you get what I'm saying so
[1:04:37] approach God not about what you thinking
[1:04:40] about yourself but approach God about
[1:04:43] what he's saying about who you
[1:04:45] [Applause]
[1:04:48] are because you won't forget am but he
[1:04:52] can forget
[1:04:54] am are we together are we together amen
[1:04:59] the Bible says in verse S but you shall
[1:05:02] die like men this is an Earthly
[1:05:06] record are we together this is an
[1:05:09] Earthly record or an Earthly book amen
[1:05:15] or what we call our natural
[1:05:20] record which is a messy one
[1:05:26] this is where all the mess are amen this
[1:05:29] is all the
[1:05:31] crying all the
[1:05:34] fall
[1:05:36] sin
[1:05:38] amen
[1:05:41] tribulations and so
[1:05:45] forth bottom line it is a bad
[1:05:49] record a bad one we clear amen are we
[1:05:53] clear amen so he says but you shall die
[1:05:58] like man and fall like one of the
[1:06:01] princes so
[1:06:03] God is
[1:06:06] mindful of your second record before you
[1:06:10] were
[1:06:19] born remember on Wednesday you do not
[1:06:22] inform
[1:06:23] God God knows about
[1:06:26] everything this Psalm was spoken before
[1:06:30] any of us were
[1:06:32] born it was spoken in the time of David
[1:06:36] amen but David only caught the Eternal
[1:06:39] mind of
[1:06:41] God and spoke it so he was already in
[1:06:44] eternity are we together so before
[1:06:48] that's why God told jeremi before you
[1:06:50] were even
[1:06:52] formed in your mother's Wom I already
[1:06:56] knew you I know I'm I'm I'm I'm going
[1:06:59] through the scripture so I can stabilize
[1:07:01] somebody so we can take off quickly God
[1:07:04] says before the children were born this
[1:07:08] is what your boss just gave me to help
[1:07:10] somebody the Bible say before the
[1:07:13] children were
[1:07:15] born you know that scripture right
[1:07:18] before they even do anything good or bad
[1:07:23] this is what the Bible say how many
[1:07:25] knows that
[1:07:26] scripture the Bible say I love
[1:07:30] Jacob are we together and I hated
[1:07:34] Esau God how can you hate a child that
[1:07:38] is not born
[1:07:39] yet how can you hate a child that have
[1:07:42] not even committed a
[1:07:46] crime in other word god knew your record
[1:07:52] already and knowing your record he L
[1:07:59] you according to our
[1:08:03] way you are slowing me down so remember
[1:08:07] to give me my time okay ah if I if I sit

[1:08:37] brother devil
[1:08:40] amen if you never seen the
[1:08:44] devil and if you never seen brother
[1:08:46] Benjamin we human being you will begin
[1:08:49] to conjure up you will begin to
[1:08:53] create your own image of who Benjamin
[1:08:57] is you would say you know what if
[1:09:00] brother Steven love Benjamin so benjam
[1:09:03] must be a good boy must be a boy like
[1:09:07] this a boy like this a boy like this a
[1:09:10] boy and you will have a whole curriculum
[1:09:12] V of brother
[1:09:15] Benjamin are we together and if they
[1:09:17] turn around they say hey I hate the
[1:09:20] devil you will put horns on the
[1:09:23] devil and you will put a tail on the
[1:09:26] devil but brother Bram said the devil
[1:09:29] doesn't have a
[1:09:31] tail the devil doesn't have a
[1:09:38] home and matter of fact brother Bram say
[1:09:42] when the devil was also expressed in
[1:09:45] human flesh he looks
[1:09:49] handsome in the person of Judas is
[1:09:52] [Applause]
[1:09:53] scariot right are we together are we
[1:09:56] together but God declare he say I love
[1:10:01] Jacob that's
[1:10:04] right God didn't say I love
[1:10:10] Israel please my friend please my friend
[1:10:14] Shake somebody's hand say hey where are
[1:10:16] you at God never say I love
[1:10:20] Israel God say I love who Jacob do you
[1:10:23] know what Jacob means
[1:10:28] do you know what it means is my Bible
[1:10:30] different than your Bible God say I love
[1:10:33] who Jacob and Jacob means what a supp a
[1:10:40] cheer and God say I love
[1:10:44] Jacob in other word God didn't remove
[1:10:49] that name when he expressed his
[1:10:53] love Hallelujah and brother Bram say a
[1:10:57] name goes with a
[1:10:59] [Applause]
[1:11:00] nature now your eyes have change when I
[1:11:04] say I love Jacob you were looking at
[1:11:06] Jacob according to the predestinated
[1:11:08] seed but God look at Jacob by the name
[1:11:15] Jacob amen and when Jacob came into the
[1:11:18] word he was the bad one in other word
[1:11:22] when Jacob moved from the first record
[1:11:25] and bypass the record are we together
[1:11:29] and jump into the second record we found
[1:11:32] Joseph a bad
[1:11:36] man are we together but when es
[1:11:43] saw because in hell they got theop also
[1:11:47] let me leave that alone amen but when
[1:11:49] Esau came down he appeared to be the
[1:11:52] good one
[1:11:55] [Applause]
[1:11:58] amen amen amen so when you look you say
[1:12:02] who did God choose the bad
[1:12:04] one that's why God is telling you before
[1:12:07] you were born I already love
[1:12:12] you I saw this record
[1:12:15] already but I look he look
[1:12:20] beyond my fault and saw my need
[1:12:25] are we together am are we together are
[1:12:28] we together so this prophecy was big was
[1:12:32] given before any of us here was born sir
[1:12:36] what I'm trying to make you understand
[1:12:38] is God knew you he knew your
[1:12:42] record amen when we will get into the
[1:12:45] depth of perfection you will see that
[1:12:47] even your future sin God already saw
[1:12:51] them amen amen
[1:12:57] let me ask you a question Lord look at
[1:13:00] Judas he say heaven have did he not
[1:13:04] choose you all of so who chose
[1:13:11] Judah and he say one of you is an angel
[1:13:16] one of you is what a devil how can God
[1:13:18] choose a
[1:13:21] devil please do you need the scripture
[1:13:24] why why why did God choose a devil so
[1:13:27] you think God didn't know
[1:13:30] Judah Amen brother Bram say he already
[1:13:33] knew and he even call him
[1:13:37] friend are we together knowing what
[1:13:40] Judah would do and giving even Judah the
[1:13:43] power to preach the
[1:13:46] gospel now it's getting into different
[1:13:49] material amen so before you have done
[1:13:53] anything in this world
[1:13:55] God already knew
[1:13:58] you God knew you in a Divine record and
[1:14:03] God knew you into the natural record and
[1:14:06] God say listen even though you're going
[1:14:09] to go through this but remember you are
[1:14:16] God because there is a batt here between
[1:14:19] the two amen which is contradiction to
[1:14:23] the first sentence amen
[1:14:26] Amen in other word This Record here will
[1:14:30] never change the first
[1:14:33] record amen I am mindful of
[1:14:38] everything because Love cover how many
[1:14:43] sin that's why our
[1:14:46] love the love of God in Jacob will do
[1:14:49] what for Jacob cover how many
[1:14:52] sin are we together now we clear right
[1:14:56] we clear right hall let's go to Luke
[1:15:01] 15 glory to
[1:15:04] God Luke
[1:15:06] 15 I'm going to start to ver from verse
[1:15:09] 11 instead of 17 so we can make a point
[1:15:15] here you see how long you can read the
[1:15:19] scripture amen so when you're reading
[1:15:21] one chapter a day you don't know what is
[1:15:23] under that chapter
[1:15:26] and God is saying just read one chapter
[1:15:29] and you think you are doing some hard
[1:15:31] work oh I didn't read the chapter what
[1:15:33] about if God say read the chapter and
[1:15:35] read the things under the
[1:15:39] chapter you will stuck in one chapter
[1:15:41] for
[1:15:43] eternity amen amen let's go to verse 11
[1:15:47] if you dare you can say amen amen amen
[1:15:51] you there amen the Bible says and a
[1:15:54] certain and he said a certain man had
[1:15:56] two sons we are focusing on the

[1:16:20] of them said to his father father give

[1:16:55] record is when he came back
[1:16:58] home amen from home outside the home

[1:17:07] resurrection

[1:17:23] relationship yes sir with his
[1:17:26] father there was a
[1:17:29] relationship amen oh a
[1:17:33] fellowship amen with his father this
[1:17:37] fellowship at home gave him access to
[1:17:41] even ask anything including his own
[1:17:48] inheritance are we together usually when
[1:17:52] do you receive an inheritance
[1:17:55] when your father die are we together but
[1:17:59] this boy receive it when the father is
[1:18:01] not even

[1:20:25] of Daddy and Paul say a testament is not
[1:20:30] in effect until the death of the one who
[1:20:33] wrote it
[1:20:35] amen and if the death of Jesus Christ is
[1:20:38] confirmed by autopsy that Jesus died it
[1:20:43] means everything that Jesus had for me
[1:20:46] and
[1:20:52] you are we together are we together are
[1:20:56] we together are we together but watch
[1:21:00] this

[1:21:06] that but watch the son daddy is not dead
[1:21:14] yet I'm giving you time to get

[1:21:31] daddy before his death what kind of
[1:21:37] relationship existed between this boy
[1:21:40] and his
[1:21:41] father take time now you will understand
[1:21:45] why they gave him the best
[1:21:47] [Applause]
[1:21:51] robe I hope we are together I hope we
[1:21:54] are together let me start it again my
[1:21:57] friend let me start it again my friend
[1:22:00] because you slowing me way down okay let
[1:22:04] me start it again okay okay you go to a
[1:22:08] bank you want to buy a house brother AB
[1:22:12] they say before you buy a house you need
[1:22:15] to have three years of experience and
[1:22:17] work do you follow me do you follow me
[1:22:21] whatever they told you it's not a lie
[1:22:23] that's it and it is built in the bank
[1:22:27] system that they must take those
[1:22:30] information and verify them and input
[1:22:33] them so the computer can generate an
[1:22:37] approval amen an approval through and
[1:22:42] under do you follow me do you follow me
[1:22:45] now I know clearly that brother
[1:22:49] Greg only have one year of experience
[1:22:52] yes yes sir yes sir
[1:22:55] amen amen but for some reason brother
[1:22:58] Greg is coming to me he said brother
[1:23:00] Steven I got an approval from the bank I
[1:23:03] said which bank that Bank of America
[1:23:05] right there gave me an approval from the
[1:23:08] bank but I only have one year of
[1:23:10] experience when brother CH did the same
[1:23:13] thing and they refus him before you
[1:23:16] begin to get upset you need to ask a
[1:23:19] question who does brother Greg know in
[1:23:21] the bank
[1:23:26] I I I I'm I'm going through this example
[1:23:29] so you can suck in in other word brother
[1:23:32] Greg might have a different
[1:23:34] Channel and that channel can bypass the
[1:23:38] laws of the
[1:23:40] bank are we together so he can use a
[1:23:43] different leverage that leverage need
[1:23:47] only a saying somebody give him a phone
[1:23:50] call and say I understand he doesn't
[1:23:53] qualify but go go ahead and give him the
[1:23:56] [Applause]
[1:23:59] blone we clear now together let's go
[1:24:02] back again to our prodal son according
[1:24:05] to the law according to Paul you cannot
[1:24:08] get your inheritance until your father
[1:24:11] die are we together but this boy his
[1:24:15] father is
[1:24:16] alive mama is alive because usually when
[1:24:20] you approach father like that mommy will
[1:24:23] be the one getting up
[1:24:24] said and say what are you trying to do
[1:24:28] huh your father is not even dead so you
[1:24:30] want to take
[1:24:31] everything usually it's mama who get
[1:24:39] upset amen amen amen because even a life
[1:24:45] insurance cannot be dispersed to you
[1:24:48] correctly until the death of the one
[1:24:51] that have the life insurance you can
[1:24:53] borrow from this
[1:24:55] but you won't really get the full
[1:24:58] benefit are we together are we together
[1:25:02] but this son goes to Father elive say
[1:25:06] Daddy give me what belongs to
[1:25:09] me so you are even Breaking Bad I mean
[1:25:13] uh daddy's
[1:25:15] business if Daddy owns a company you're
[1:25:17] telling him now to sell the company
[1:25:20] which brother Bram say he had to sell it
[1:25:22] amen and to divide everything what I'm
[1:25:25] trying to point out to you is there was
[1:25:28] a
[1:25:30] relationship between this boy here and
[1:25:33] his father are we together and his
[1:25:36] relationship was so strong until even
[1:25:40] before the death of his father this boy
[1:25:45] can push something amen and receive what
[1:25:49] is usually received after the death
[1:25:56] I'm going to drop where you want me to
[1:25:57] drop my friend amen amen amen Jesus came
[1:26:03] on this Earth and he looked at the
[1:26:06] disciple amen and he was walking
[1:26:09] somewhere and his weakness hid
[1:26:11] [Music]
[1:26:14] him we getting somewhere my friend and
[1:26:17] when he HD him Jesus was looking for
[1:26:20] food that's right he turned around he
[1:26:22] look at the tree and he curs the tree we
[1:26:26] all know the story everybody goes home
[1:26:29] in the morning they coming back they
[1:26:30] look Peter say hey remember it's only
[1:26:33] Peter who sees stuff like that because
[1:26:36] Peter means
[1:26:38] Faith are we together and when Peter
[1:26:41] look he said Master you remember the
[1:26:43] tree that you cursed yesterday Jesus
[1:26:46] purposely went with them through the
[1:26:49] same
[1:26:51] road to make sure they witness that's
[1:26:54] what he did
[1:26:57] yesterday amen when he spoke the tree

[1:27:03] normal when he bypassed the tree was
[1:27:06] normal and Jesus went to sleep he never
[1:27:10] put a
[1:27:11] camera to watch if the tree is dying or
[1:27:14] not he had confidence on his
[1:27:21] word are we together and when he woke up
[1:27:24] in the morning Jesus never say wait a
[1:27:26] minute let me call who lives one day
[1:27:29] buddy go check if the tree is dead
[1:27:31] before I bring my disciple there and
[1:27:33] because I don't want to bring them there
[1:27:34] and the tree is not dead then they would
[1:27:36] say master you don't have power Jesus
[1:27:39] never had time for that he knew what he
[1:27:41] spoke
[1:27:44] happened we getting somewhere ye are
[1:27:48] Gods ye are Gods amen and then when he
[1:27:53] came he was in full confidence of what
[1:27:55] they're going to find and notice he
[1:27:57] never even told them look at the tree
[1:27:59] that are cursed he let them witness
[1:28:03] [Applause]
[1:28:04] [Music]
[1:28:06] that are we together are we together
[1:28:09] when Peter spoke Jesus pushed the break
[1:28:13] he said
[1:28:14] Peter you know one thing he said you see
[1:28:18] that mountain that is over there follow
[1:28:20] me carefully he said if you speak to
[1:28:24] that
[1:28:25] mountain not me if you speak to that
[1:28:29] mountain how do you speak just like
[1:28:32] Jesus spoke and when you speak to the
[1:28:34] mountain you cannot stop also watching
[1:28:36] the
[1:28:39] mountain you see what kind of faith we
[1:28:41] need to Heaven you see what kind of
[1:28:43] Faith you need to heaven in other words
[1:28:46] if I spoke to this hand I won't pay
[1:28:48] attention to this hand anymore
[1:28:51] Hall the hand must obey what has
[1:28:56] spok and you need to testify that I used
[1:29:00] to see your hand like this what happened
[1:29:02] to your hand brother
[1:29:05] Steven are we together are we together
[1:29:09] my friend and then he says if you speak
[1:29:12] to this mountain amen amen amen you move
[1:29:16] and throw yourself onto the sea it will
[1:29:20] happen amen and brother brother
[1:29:25] yes what about I'm say wait a minute
[1:29:28] this power amen cannot be given without
[1:29:33] the death of Jesus
[1:29:37] Christ I have the quat my
[1:29:40] friend Amen brother Bram say normally
[1:29:44] Jesus must die
[1:29:46] first follow me carefully and then his
[1:29:50] blood will cleanse
[1:29:52] men and then when the blood of Jesus
[1:29:55] Christ cleans man man comes back to the
[1:29:58] position of
[1:30:01] Eden are we together when man is in the
[1:30:05] position of Eden when he's completely
[1:30:07] without sin then man can speak like Adam
[1:30:11] but Jesus didn't wait for his
[1:30:16] death he released that power without his
[1:30:21] death so the creative power of God was
[1:30:25] released before the
[1:30:27] [Applause]
[1:30:32] atonement and brother Bram come he say
[1:30:35] no no no no no no I don't understand the
[1:30:37] scripture brother Bram say I won't even
[1:30:39] preach on that one right because I don't
[1:30:42] think that promise is in the atonement
[1:30:45] right amen and one time brother Bram was
[1:30:48] going in the wood and God came down
[1:30:52] butam was thinking about that he said I
[1:30:54] still don't understand how can this
[1:30:57] scripture be given before the atonement
[1:30:59] God came down the author of the book
[1:31:02] came
[1:31:03] down he said brother what are you
[1:31:06] thinking about he say I have difficulty
[1:31:08] with that scripture he say what what
[1:31:11] when you speak on the discernment do you
[1:31:13] think it's
[1:31:14] [Applause]
[1:31:17] you how can you have a discernment that
[1:31:20] never
[1:31:21] misses do you think it's a human being
[1:31:25] and he said brother Bram what do you
[1:31:27] think about the prophet of
[1:31:32] old because the prophet were
[1:31:36] [Applause]
[1:31:41] Gods because Jesus said if they call
[1:31:45] those to whom the word of the Lord came
[1:31:49] God that's why the Bible say the word of
[1:31:51] the Lord came to Isaiah the word of the
[1:31:54] Lord came to Jeremiah the word of the
[1:31:56] Lord came to this and Jesus said if the
[1:31:59] word of the Lord comes to you you are
[1:32:07] God and according to Revelation 10 not
[1:32:11] just a portion but the full word of God
[1:32:15] came down toward
[1:32:17] [Applause]
[1:32:20] you and God say now Ro Brad take the
[1:32:25] word eat the word you are
[1:32:30] [Applause]
[1:32:37] God I hope we are moving together I hope
[1:32:41] we are moving together I hope we are
[1:32:44] moving together I hope we are moving
[1:32:47] together are we together are we together
[1:32:51] are we together in other word created
[1:32:54] Power could be taken before the death of
[1:32:58] Jesus Christ that's why Moses
[1:33:05] created I'm going slowly my friend and
[1:33:08] the Bible says God say among all the
[1:33:12] prophet Propet there is no Prophet like
[1:33:17] Moses because Moses when I talk to
[1:33:21] him I don't have a veil
[1:33:29] that's why God told Moses I'm going to
[1:33:32] do something that Abraham doesn't know
[1:33:35] Isaac doesn't know Jacob doesn't know
[1:33:37] I'm going to reveal myself to you like
[1:33:40] Jehovah you a man will become
[1:33:44] [Applause]
[1:33:48] God before the death of Jesus Christ
[1:33:52] showing you that the
[1:33:54] showing you that the
[1:33:56] relationship between Moses and God was
[1:33:59] so
[1:34:04] tight
[1:34:06] until God never allow even the body of
[1:34:10] Moses to be touched by the
[1:34:17] [Applause]
[1:34:20] devil not a living body a dead body
[1:34:24] God didn't allow the devil to even
[1:34:30] [Applause]
[1:34:31] know are we together are we together so
[1:34:35] the level of
[1:34:38] relationship detering the access into
[1:34:41] the
[1:34:43] [Applause]
[1:34:47] atonement the closer you are in the
[1:34:50] relationship is the more powerful
[1:34:54] to and this child here even though dadd
[1:34:58] is not dead yet he had the power to ask
[1:35:02] for his inheritance before the death of
[1:35:07] daddy we read this scripture over and
[1:35:10] over but it's a new book this morning
[1:35:13] amen so this boy had a full access to
[1:35:17] the
[1:35:18] atonement because he was very closer to
