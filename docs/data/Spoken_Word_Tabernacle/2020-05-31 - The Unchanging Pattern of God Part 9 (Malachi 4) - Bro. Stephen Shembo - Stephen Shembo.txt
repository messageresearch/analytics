religion and called in okra he's a man than the profit from the desert he started preaching all around God as heard our prayers Jehovah has come down Moses sure was no good preacher nothing nothing nothing polished I could tell but we all began to notice that he knew to Hoover well has disturbed behind this pulpit showing signs of God's great powers to overhear the message of the on the journey through the desert about 30 miles high was a cloud the lettuce in a day and a night a pillar of fire I know Jehovah's here to lead us all the way a pillar of fire by night and the cloud by day I know

Jesus [Music] Jesus things are possible Jesus easy amen god bless you we greet you all in the name of Jesus Christ those that are here and those that are online streaming so the brothers have not helped express any burning yet so by the grace of God we continue with our thoughts Genesis chapter 8 verse 6 we need your spiritual life saver jacket some of you know how to swim so when I say that I don't mean everybody some of you already know how to swim some are still learning so if you dare you can say amen verse thinks I need to go slowly and he came to pass at the end of 40 days that Noah opened the window of the ark which he had made you might be seated I was coming with my wife and there was a truck driving in front of me and they draw a crow a raven and they also wrote on the truck Raven so I told my wife I'd say look at that she said whoa that's not good in Jesus name she didn't know you was to me a confirmation of this message amen verse seven and he sent forth a raven now you saw the Raven so it was a confirmation that I'm lineup and he sent forth a raven which went forth to and fro that word to and fro does not mean that the raven was going in and out if you look in another translation to infra means that when the raven left the ark the raven was going from places to places in other word the Raven never came back to the ark he stayed outside there was no more rain and the Raven keep feasting on whatever was out there so he stayed up there so the first time or the first ministry that Noah is pushing forward is a raven and are even when he went in begin to go from places to places and the Raven never came back if you notice the revenues in the ark there Evan lived in Ark but one of this day a window was open for the Raven to leave the ark and was the Raven left the ark the true nature of the Raven was revealed inside the ark draven could feast with the food that Noah carry in the earth but once the resin left the earth then the true nature that was covered under the ark came out everybody clear hallelujah until the waters were dried up from of the earth verse 8 also he sent forth a dove so number one a raven comes out and after the raven as the ministry progresses we find out that the ministry was changed from a raven to a ministry of a dog everybody clear you must understand this now because down the road things are going to change hallelujah he said and he also sent forth a dove from him to see if the water's were abated so the water we know in the Bible means the multitude of the people and I bought those water were bodies of dead men dead women they were floating upon the waters of judgment so the people that were outside the ark were already dead they all seemed and they all come short from the glory of God they were all dead in sin Ella very queer I hope that why I say put your spiritual jacket are you there to see if the water's were abated from off the face of the ground but the dog found no rest for the sole of her feet the sole of her foot speak of a position if you need a scripture on that brother branham save it you never give a scripture probably if you don't find a scripture see me because our prophet is line up with the Bible there is no way you can separate the message from the Bible there is no argument between the Bible and the message they are together the message was inside the Bible but the message was hidden and it took a prophet to pull the message out of the Bible so you cannot separate the message from the Bible blackball went into the Old Testament and pulled the New Testament from the Old Testament and the message pulled both the new and the Old Testament and pull everything together so there is no way you can contradict that one so the dog have not found a rest for the sole of the foot are you there so the dog was looking for a rest place the dog was looking for a place where she can put a cleanse the sole of the foot so the dog was looking for a place where she can rest and we know the word western speak of the baptism of the holy ghost you know so this bath was looking for a place where she can baptize someone where she can rest on someone she traveled all around but all she could see was dead bodies so there was no one that the dog could claim as a possession and to enter the body everybody clear and she returned to him into the ark for the waters were on the face of the whole earth then he puts forth his head who put forth the hand Noah so when the dog was coming back into the ark Noah reach out his hand everybody listened and the dog sat on the hand of Laura and Noah pulled the dog back into the ark and I'm gonna say that there was a hand that Noah helped to push outside there was a hand and let me call this handle I presume it was and what a Steven the Baba didn't say that you need the Prophet everybody there verse 9 but they don't find no rest for the sole of her foot and she returned to him into the ark for the waters were on the face of the earth so the first ministry of this dog she goes out she was funding for a place to claim there is no place for the claim the dog came back as the dog is coming back Noah pushed his right hand outside and the dog sat on the right hand of Lord and the dog came back into the ark she came into the ark by sitting on the right hand of Noah and he put forth his hand and took her and pull her in to him into the ark and he stayed yet other seven days after this first ministry of the dog Noah have to wait seven days there was a disposition of seven days I have to follow the us into the ark for seven days one two three four five six seven everybody clear hallelujah and again he sent forth the dog out of the ark the dog was sent out of the ark brother of it not on the seventh day but on the day that followed the seventh day which is the eighth day hallelujah with the opening of the seals the barber became a new book are you there and he sent forth the dead they dove out of the ark and the dog came into him in the evening so on the eighth day they dog slept again the ark we have the first coming of the dog where I hear everybody here there is a first coming of the dogs and there is a second coming of the dog into the earth day everybody there and then if you notice on the next verse on the same verse the Bible said the next verse verse 11 the Bible say and the Dove came into him in the evening so the dog must have been left from the ark in the morning the dog was left out of the ark in the morning but they have never came run a quick they have to wait until the evening that came back into the ark so there is a coming back from the outside in the evening time but there is something that happened in the evening with the dog everybody there verse 11 and the dog came in to him in the evening and lo in her mouth was an olive leaves those products so when the dog was left in the morning they dove left the ark on the eighth day that was the morning but on the evening the dogs came back to the ark with an olive leash that means that a dog stooop or stood on all these trees somewhere so there is a ministry of an olive tree that is going to happen with that love'em an olive tree in the Bible means Israel you need a Bible in Vedic Scripture you see me that God left when she left on the eighth day she first left in the morning and she went somewhere where we don't know but after that they both continued and went into an olive tree because the dog heaven industry to finish upon the olive trees and when they finished a ministry upon the olive tree then she planned us a list from an olive tree and the dog went back again to the ark after finishing the ministry of the olive tree not the morning history but evening ministries that she's dealing with Israel before the dog goes back so that dog is coming out going somewhere job to Israel when she finishes then the job comes back again to the ark everybody clear your Bible change now amen so Noah knew that the waters were abated from the UM of the earth verse 12 and he stayed yet other seven days after the coming back into the ark everybody following me they don't stay again Noah stays again seven days there was a disposition of seven days here and there is a second dispensation of the seven days here everybody clear seven days here and the dog was will on the eighth day and no aware that against seven days here and he's gonna send the dog again watch your verse verse 12 and he said yet other seven days and sent forth the dog so that dog again for the third time here was sent on the eighth day let me recapitulate give me my time the first ministry is the weapon rather lofty never came back then the earth was release the dog was looking for a place of claim who puts the sole of her foot and when the Lord a dog came back again glowers stretch up his right hand the box didn't say right hand I am to one okay and then when the opposite he spreads his hand but we need the Prophet to know which hand water are we but I'm saying just by presuming now that it is nor stretch out his right hand they dog sat on the right hand and he pull it back into the Oracle then he waited seven days of a disposition on the and coming up the dog comes down when that dog comes down he dropped down into an olive tree and the evening and when he finished the Ministry of the evening he goes back again to the ark Noah waited against seven other days but on the eighth day he will leave the top again the picture is clear let's go back on verse 12 and he stayed yet other seven days and sent forth the dog which returned not again to him anymore so when the dog was released on the eighth day the dog went forever they both went for eternity there is no more coming of death back to the artist everybody there okay verse 13 and he came to pass in the six hundred and first year in the first month the first day of the mouth the waters were dried up from of the earth and no I removed the covering of the Ark there was a covering of the Ark that no ahead Noah kept that covering this time - after the last release of the dog remove the covering from of the ark he didn't need that covering anymore because the earth was already we knew he was a new earth the first covering the first heaven have to be removed let us sink because it's a new beginning of another day everybody clear of the ark and look and behold the face of the grand was water dry in other words there was no more water there was no more waters there was a new era here a new covering new heaven and there was no more water and no more sea after yesterday it was released and when I was release in this condition then those never came back again into the ark everybody clear so far let's go to first Kings chapter 17 a whole message has been already preached well it David is weather over there praise God you greet him for me first Kings chapter 17 verse 1 I'm begging you to give me my time everybody there and a large added Tish but who was of the inhabitant of Galen say to Arab as the Lord of Israel lives before who must and they shall not be do nor when these years but according to my word and the word of the Lord came to him saying get you from here and turn a sorter new ish word and hide yourself by the brook he carried that is before Jordan and it shall be that you shall drink of the brook and I have commanded the revenge my wife the relevance there is a Ministry of Elijah that is connected to the Ravens he have commander if you notice does have does reven were commended by God they were commended they were under the leadership of God there were ordained by God everybody clear they were ordained by God I have commanded the rhythm to feed you there so we went and did according to the word of the Lord for he went and well by the book carrot that is before Jordan and the revin brought him bread and flesh if you notice the know the diet or the the meal that the Raven brought they brought bread bread is not a dead body as far as somebody who is dying outside but this is a food that is cooked by someone so they doves of Elijah were not even food they have bread and they also have flesh or meat brother branham call it somewhere a sandwich so somebody was cooking somewhere bread and meat a true hamburger everybody there okay flesh in the morning and bread and flesh in the evening they were morning and evening everybody there and he drunk off the brook and he came after he came to pass after a while that the brook dried up because there had been no rain in the land and the word of the Lord came to him saying arras get you to Zarafa Zarafa is not in Israel zurafa is a Gentile place there is an interaction of Elijah with reverence and there is an interaction of Elijah with a Gentile woman with a gentle woman who was a widow verse 9 he was get you to the wafer which belongs to Zion and you are there behold I have done water I have commanded everybody's in there God commended the ravenna and good also commended their we know who man she was a Weedle that means that her first husband died already she was no longer after under the leadership of her first husband because Paul Paul in Romans chapter 7 Paul told us that your first husband must die and you must be married to your second husband are you there so this window already left from under the headship of the first husband everybody did and she was a widow that God commended she was a leader that was under the leadership of God yet she was a Gentile she was married to everybody clear I have commanded a widow woman there to sustain you if we can job to verse 12 and she say everybody there as the Lord your God leaves I have not a cake but a handful of mill in a barrel and a leader all in the crews and behold I am gathering water she is gathering two sticks so this widow woman no headship first husband died we notice also that the Bible say that this woman was connected to two sticks we need to find out what are those two sticks are you there that I may go in and dress it for me and my son that we may eat it and die life scripture let's go to add to chapter 10 if you dare you can say Amen add to chapter 10 if I don't do this when I'm traveling you want to be lost quickly add to chapter 10 verse 11 if you dare you can say Amen all right this is Peter who was in his house and Peter got a vision because an angel met a Gentile a Gentile by the name of Cornelius and he sent the people to go and to talk to Peter now verse 11 and I saw heaven open these things are coming from heaven okay I saw heaven open and a certain vessel descending to him as he had been a great sheet knit at four corners and led down to the earth wherein all manner of four-footed beasts of the earth and while the beasts so there was a sheet that came down from heaven that had animals dead and that have wild animal not tame animal but that that came from heaven was filled with wild animal world animal world beast verse 12 and creeping things and fowls of the air so the force of the earth were also in this sheet that came down from heaven everybody did they tell you what category of falls so I can assume that somehow here the crow or the Raven was undone from heaven and we are verse 13 and there came a voice to him saying rise to him Roz Peter kill and eat but Peter say not so Lord for I have never eaten anything that is wake up please that is common all so these things that came out of heaven where unclean unclean this wild beast unclean thousand winter Raven is an unclean foul Riven from the Ark of Noah Raven dealing with Elijah Gentile with an unclean from heaven everybody there this was done twice and the vessel was receive up to oh no verse 15 and the voice spoke to him again the second time what God has cleans da call not you common when people look because he was a Jew Peter could distinguish the clean animal according to the Book of Leviticus and the unclean animal but when Peter was looking Peter said this category is an unclean category I do I am forbidden by the law to eat unclean animal but God corrected the breeder and say that God the animal on the that are dropping down for heaven this category here are not unclean as you think they are clean by God are you there this is a raven right here but this raven is under the command of god this is a gentle woman here this gentle woman is under the command of god these are unclean beasts to the normal eye but these are clean beasts has been cleaned by god they are not anymore everybody there verse 28 if you can drop down and he said to them you know how that is an Olaf ooh think for a man that is a Jew this is the law now to keep company or to come to one of another nation are there either is explaining and you cannot have fellowship with a gentle period are you there okay now God show him the Gentile as unclean animal but those unclean animal are coming down from heaven everybody clear okay praise God all come not to another nation we own verse 20 but God has showed me that I should not call any man common or unholy or unclean everybody there lets job to verse 34 that we're going to pray then Peter opened his mouth and say of a truth I perceive that God is no respecter - a person a leader of person but in every nation they were teaching them that it was not only to the Jewish nation that God was dealing only with the Jews but God also deal with gentle you know in every nation either that feed the fears him and work righteousness is accepted to him in the eyes of Peter you will remain a gentle in the eyes of Peter you will remain an American in the eyes of Peter you will remain a Congolese in the eyes of Peter you want to imagine but in the eyes of God you are no longer in the eyes of God you are no more African in the eyes of God you are no more Canadian and God don't pee they don't look on the outside because I already clean those people and is a different category of people altogether and that category is Gentiles let's pray Heavenly Father Lord we thank you for your grace your love and your mercy for giving us another opportunity to gather together around your word father we are committing this service unto the hand menu remove every weakness Lord every weary spirit Lord every spirit Lord father that is putting people under pressure Lord may we will add sunder the leadership and the anointing of the Holy Spirit Lord may you come and strengthen and teach Lord and heal and burn the brokenhearted and stabilize and baptize with the Holy Spirit Lord father may you do mighty work in the midst of us this morning for those who are present here even for those who are on the online virtual Lord father be deified the Omega of this service in the name of Jesus Christ amen god bless you and then we are on part 9 of our team the unchanging pattern of God oh brother Branham say that in the handwriting on the wall that's brother Branham said that but any and now any Bible reader here knows that all scripture have a compound meaning every prophecy some most of it has a dual to a time there or two terms or more are there sometimes a scripture can mean one thing sometimes scripture can be applied twice or sometimes a scripture can be applied multiple times means different things two terms or more that it shall be answered as a revolving of history in other world history repeats itself something that was applied to Israel might be applied today to the Gentile everybody clear in a message this day the scripture is fulfilled by random say history always repeat itself and a scripture has a compound meaning to it and a compound revelation so a scripture can mean one thing here and you can take the same scripture and it means something different that's why a preacher can stand on this pulpit he can use a scripture and preach a message and another preacher comes after him he uses that same Scripture and preached a totally different message because every scripture have a compound meaning everybody clear so far so last week we establish the process of horrible because we are dealing with Malachi 4 it was easier for you to go to Malachi 4 and to begin to read this is the day the Lord will burn the Lord will do this the Sun of righteousness and then remember Moses in Horeb but today when you go back to Malachi 4 when you begin to read those chapter they begin to make different to you when you begin to look at the Sun of righteousness you know remains when you begin to look at remember my servant Moses in or Horeb the way you looked at her before is completely different than the way you are looking at Horeb today and then when we looked at Horeb we found out that there were two prophet Tower in Horeb and we have been dealing with this prophet back and forth Moses and Elijah Moses and Elijah Moses and Elijah modern Moses modern Elijah so when we looked at Moses in a horrible we found out that the three point that we pull from orab Auto Moses the first point we found out that they were the table of the law that were given first to Moses and brother branham explained to us under the vision of junior Jackson that door table of law represented the Bible and then we found out that there was a second table of law that was given to Moses and brother Branham explained to us under the vision of genetics on that's that second table of law that did not have riding on it was the revelation of the seals that were locking the entire Bible and then the third point was that brotherbrother were the words that in Horeb God established a law with Israel and God showed to Israel that from this day forward any time I want to talk to my people I will use a prophet so we found out that spoke that spoke of the ministry that happened on Sunset Mountain on Sunset Mountain because on Sunset Mountain the blaster came there because Sunset mountain was connected to the revelation of the Seventh Seal and we found out that they are folding of the sixth seal and the seven shall require a prophet that's why before God say I will send you Elijah the prophet God first they have to tell you remember horrible remember what happened to Horeb and then I'm gonna send you Elijah the prophet because it's a ministry that will require prophet everybody clear then from there on we found out that when that ministry came out we found out that the second table of the law were not different than the first table of the law this has to make sure that the second table of the law has to line up with the first table of the law that's why we say that you cannot separate the message from the Bible because the message is completely line up with the duck whoa everybody fear he was written in your Bible the second person that we saw in Oran was Elijah and then Elijah revealed to us in Horeb that it was a kiss so speaking that if Elijah come in the end time we must be a man we must see a man that is connected with a cave then the second part of Elijah's ministry in Horeb was connected with a sequence of five element number one there was a whirlwind that came from heaven number two there was rocks that came out of it number three there was an earthquake that followed that number four they was fired at him off and then number five they also is still small force at the voice of the seventh angel the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound or the meaning of the mystery of God must be we feel and we found that this all happened in Sunset Mountain when the angel came and visited brother Branham everybody clear but does the same Mountain which is Sunset mountain this event happened twice that was the first time in the second term when the event happened brother Branham says here he says that right beside a great Canyon eight or ten times higher than this building it is a box canyon like a fire we see fire again here everybody come down from heaven like a whirlwind we see again a whirlwind coming down here just a few feet above where I was standing this is the second time are you there because every word must be established with two or three witness everybody there so he says and rip the rocks the rock again popping up with the rocks right out of the mountain went through and cut the top of the mesquite trees of a four hundred yards out everybody is running trying to get the truck and everything else he went back up again and club like a great thunder so this the first Thunder that came up with the seven angels one panda and seven and jokin but this time it was three thunders that thundered one to return but the same event again happen under sunset multi you know what wanna say went back up to the sky again and came down again is on that three times and he went wall over any world and when he was all over they come over and asked what did he mean in another message when they asked brother Branham worried evil brother branham gave the voice behind no standard random say immense judgment was striking the worst code in other words brother branham have an ability to understand the Thunder of God you need the Prophet who can listen to the Thunder but is not hearing noises but he's living the voice of God speaking under the Thunder are you there and he say I say I don't want to tell you please allow me Tom don't be too quick we are loaded here I don't want to tell you he was a judgment son in a few days a great earthquake you have your fire you have your whirlwind you have your work and you have an earthquake who is going to strike on western and he won't stop California Los Angeles will see it's going down she shall slide right into the ocean and two days after that the Alaskan earthquake shook Alaska so we found the fire there were when we fire the rock rolling down and we found that the other that came out under the Thunder and we also find out that there was an earthquake that shook but if you notice here brahmam is connecting that earthquake with the earthquake of Los Angeles if you study this which I don't want to get deeper here because I'm going to take three hours if you study this you gonna find out that their voice spoke to brother Branham to pick up a rock and to shoot the rock into the air why is brother branham's shooting a rock into the air and when he shoot the rock into the air but when I'm saying that was a judgment sign that struck Alaska my brother branham is telling you here that the Sun became of look he knew a cascade later on and we'll heat also Los Angeles and seek Los Angeles but later on we wanna see why brother branham have to pour something in the air because if you study the book of Revelation you'll find out that the seven angel which have the seven vowels pour his vial into the air are you there we got everybody here and you're gonna see who is my ranger praise God on the what is the attraction on the mountain rather one I'm saying I went westward upon the same Mountain in other word he was still on Sunset Mountain passing up with banku there say grow up Rock say to mr. would that self the Lord you shall see the glory of God the very next day standing there were we came down and blasted the mountain just like Elijah if you remember last week Rock cuts the tops of the top of the trees off about three or four feet above my head meant three blasts we just wear that and the brothers came running over there was about 15 men standing there preachers and everything else what was it he said what was it I said judgment is striking the cause but two days after that the earthquake almost sunk Alaska what is this light on sunset mountain in the Coronado forests of Arizona what is this strange thing that happened there that the people has been driven to has been drilled driving is from West picking up the rocks in other words when that blast shook Pritam's Rock came out from the mountain and when the blast when the thunder of God was hitting the mountain he was coming rock in a pyramid shape we did with God pick him up roads that lead around here where we struck and every one of them perfect every one Rock has three corners on it doctor of the three are one brother branham said he was a three corners Rock which was in the shape of a pyramid and he said that is part of the disease of Jesus Christ that the Father the Son and the Holy Ghost are not we person but there are three offices of one God they are one that was explained rather they are laying on discs on paper way across the nation what is this strange thing upon sunset mountain in the Coronado forest now we need to understand a little bit about that tree corner stone put your seatbelt pretty good brother branham said did you see the Lancer translation of the Bible there was a man called dr. lancer dr. Hamza was a great preacher ortero a theologian and dr. lancer translated a Bible just like we have a Scofield Bible we have a kink Bravo but this man also have a Bible which was called it has balanza translation of the Bible now brother Branham said did you ever see the lumps our translation of the Bible the old Hebrew son of God is a triangle right in other way when you look at the translation Bible of lanza on top of the cover lancer put a son of the jewels of the hebrew and that son was a he will shine for God and brother branham say go look at the bubbl look on top of the bubble you wanna sit recover there is a Sunday that Sun that is there is the Hebrew son of God every day he says that a triangle light everybody clear more or less something like that that the three attribute of God in one Godhead everybody clear and Lanza did this bubble in 1933 and this triangle right they threw in one being one God was a son to the rebou of God light so he was a light they had three corners and he was placed on top of the lamps a bubble but a Branham say in the message Shalom now now brother wanna begin to take the light of the picture of the cloud and begin to connect the picture of the cloud with the Sun that was in the lungs a bubble and that Sun appear in 1933 and the light or the cloud on son sent mountain appear in 1963 brother Branham take something that is 30 years apart it tells look at acid mantle look at the cloud and go back in the bubble that was published in tint and check the cover of a bubble everybody clear and brother branham say now in the heaven above did you notice I'm looking on this day right on the picture out there of the Life magazine we know it's the cloud that's the brother that lives here in this home has put in his wall the brother heaven his house the triangle of light now brother branham is calling the cloud that happened in Sunset Mountain the triangle of light and brother branham continues and he says I just happened to run across my man if any of you have the Lancer Baba we're talking about the three corners are you there if you notice over the cover it is a trial Trinitarian right a three-cornered right like a halo and when dr. Lanza a friend my personal friend was translating the Bible 19:33 that's when the angel told brother Branham as john the baptist was sent to forerun the first coming your message will fall on the second coming he says that is the old Hebrew symbol of God in the truth Trinitarian way that he is not true God but three manifestations of the same God Father Son and Holy Spirit the light is one complete circle of life in a triangle shape which means that God will dwell in three offices the fatherhood sonship and Holy Ghost dispossession are the same God now let me ask you a question how many people have already seen the lungphu Baba okay let me draw your attention to this border are you ready this is the Lancer bubble I let the sink brother branham say if you look at that right over there everybody following me brother bottom say that light over there it is exactly what happened in Sunset Mountain if you look at this light right here is exactly what happened in South Mountain what happened is they never knew they have the face of God in them it took the Ministry of brother Branham to reproduce the light in the cloud and when they change the angle of the light to the right he pull the first of the Hebrew God digi of the Old Testament is Jesus Christ of the New Testament you gonna find yourself one day you have blaspheme the Holy Ghost by attacking this picture as we getting down in our subject this morning halle-loo sink and then shake your hand or whatever everything clap your hand out brother Robert he's alive people get out of his website this is the light of God 930 years before this man drew and put it there but in the sky he was not pranam Joey himself confirmed this message that you hope of the Old Testament is Jesus car of the New Testament the same yesterday today and forever his brother Robert still alive in pres garden with Elijah comes after which a seat belt with brother Branham say all right remember yet future now he could not have bring the coming of God he was the Elijah but he comes first and Jesus ji j esus faith grace see five is the number of grace Elijah makes five appearance one Tom is Raja then as relation number two number three as John number four at the end of gentle gentle where is a base where is the foundation in the Bible that show us an interaction of villages with gentle people are you there and also with Moses to the Jews perfect number the perfect prophet the perfect messenger Stern both under the feet zero notice this men are kept alive by God from the original ministry for future service they serve it so well see just think the spirit of Elijah ministers fast and Moses to what keep for father further services the first time Elijah himself the second time Elijah who received Menten of elijah the tectum John the Baptist the fourth time we don't know yet we presuming they fast the system Elijah back again with Moses because I have to talk to them about the law but if you notice Elijah himself Elijah himself was a Jew in Israel Elijah was a Jew in Israel John the Baptist was a Jew in Israel Moses and Elijah Jews in Israel but this one brother Branham says he's a jackass why what is the base I'll then first Timothy chapter 4 now the spirit speaketh expressly that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith so now I'm going to take the first compound when we finish dealing with that then at Remagen differently you know it says job shall depart from the faith when you depart from the faith that means that you will pay you will under this day you were under the effects but something happened that caused you to leave the faith and to deport everybody giving heed to seducing spirits and doctrines of devils verse 2 brother Greg and speaking lies in hypocrisy when somebody begin to depart from faith you going to see a sign of life son of hypocrisy are you dead they're coming anointing of lives and an anointing of hypocrisy we're jumping to that compression why because having their conscience seared it's already sealed with an iron or hot continuing second core entity of the 13 verse 5 he said exam yourself whether you be in the face I then prove your own self no you're not your own self you don't know yourself you know what you're doing how that Jesus Christ is in you except you be help Robyn vertebral explained the scripture under the second seal he said the spirit speak expressing ly that in the last time they depart from the faith and will give him to seduce to know what sent you seducing spirits in the church that is clergy that is preachers that is preachers you know seducing clergy spirit workings of devil in the church because they have departed so that's why when we look at our scripture with power we found out that the crew was inside the ark was in the message of North Crow was living inside the message the crowd was evening they blew the food of Noah something happened to this crow that the crowd departed from Noah and the crew went outside because the window was open because the metal net window was open because the internet window was open a quasi web site was open that window won't happen and because of that crazy web site Republican to depart from the Lord when we look at the chrome but watch you see the son of Ravan on the road what is a crow let's look at vertical chapter 11 give me my time please leave it because chapter 11 hallelujah hallelujah probably not we are still on the surface I have not started getting under yet are you there let's read Because chapter 11 verse 13 and these if you dare you can say Amen what does it is what of it still allows praise God and these are they which you should these are day which you should have in order in abomination verse 13 if you dare you can say men in abomination in other words unclean detest among what they found there shall not be eaten they they are an abomination the first one is what amigo yet in heaven there is a legal anointing and a visual anointing is for the gentle yet not clean outside unclean gentle everybody the second is the OC fridge and the offspring number 14 verse 14 and a vulture and the kite after each candle verse 15 every Raven after each can so a reven clearly speaking here is word in heaven either an unclean bird let's go to Genesis chapter 7 if you can and after that we will continue to soar everybody clear I don't have a lot of scriptures today everybody there Genesis chapter 7 about saying amen brother David verse 14 everybody there verse 1 and the Lord I'm sorry verse 1 and the Lord said to Noah I thought 1 for 14 and the Lord said to Noah come you and all your house into the ark for you have for you have I seen righteous before me in this generation of every clean beast watch it's the Beast every clean beast you shall take to you by sevens the male and the female of the beasts that are not clean by two so when he concerned the Beast God say they are clean beasts and they are also unclean beasts if they are clean put them into their heaven if they are unclean bring them into the ark bye to everybody clear to seven Alleluia everybody there verse 3 and ofsted of files also of the air by seven in the foul Rama category whether it's clean or unclean all seven not extension of seven the male and female to keep seed alive upon the face of the earth for yet seven days and I will cause it to rain upon the earth forty days and forty nights you remember those number last week and every living substance that I have made will I destroy from off the face of the earth so clearly you found out here that's the revenue unclean bird I'm going with one compound first it's running it's a it's an unclean bird and we found out that despite the fact that he was an unclean the Raven has been given opportunity to enter into the Ark of Noah but yet even though he staged so long toward the end before the depart from the ark something happened and we know open up to let the Dove the crow graça brother Branham said now the animal dove was represented in the ark the ark in the ark all species was there and they dove and then we're there but the lab was on one floor I can prove this by the scripture or you go read your Bible and the dog was on another that was the second level and the birthday bird and thousand but in the ark set the dog and the crew and all the other they said closer together perhaps there were twins into the ark are they the zodiac spoke to the Gemina then in the ark we found the crew and a dog we found Cain and Abel we found in straw and Jacob and the crew was also under the ministry of Noah and window open up then the true color of this shows up are we there and he says and a crow in the Bible is a scavenger each [Music] denomination they are already expired that's one day Krakow is after that's why a preacher in the message cannot stand on YouTube and watching TV Jason reading the other people book and green TD jakes message in the message he was good in the time of return he was good in the time of Wesley he was good at the beginning of Pentecost but it's not our food today it is an expired Lana it is a mama that have mothers and the crew is the one eating the market additional research history under the message but a column said he is the meanest bird that's why people are so mean in the message they can do something wrong and yet they are in the message and you found this reason in preachers reven I know yet a long life fellow they don't die quickly you know he's a hypocrite in the message where they love you but they don't love you they are destroying you on the back because you don't fit the agenda the cruel under the yoke brother branham self scavenger mintzberg hypocrite under the message even in the orc the world's leaders and the crew in New York both members both of them could fly they are anointed Varanasi you know the crow is a hypocrite he is just a body hypocrite now a crock and sat down over there and on an old dead horse and just eaten cow and flap his wings and have returns but the crew can sit there and eat dead horses a half a day go out in the field and come home and eat dinner with with he can eat food from Prasad you know he is an appropriate is all did you ever notice a dog has no goal of business neither does anyone that is baptized with the Holy Ghost Oh the Builder life is gone away people in the message so bidder they have grantees for 10 years 12 years and they are still proclaiming believing the message like a hypocrite the hypocrite and the real believer in the same church and very clear in the same church same denomination setting together same pew setting together under the message but this bomb a window is already open we want to see your true colors are you there this is not the time you wanna linger anymore the biggest hypocrite there is in the world is a crow and dove and the crow they set on the same pole perhaps in New York now the dog can only eat one kind of food because it dove is one bird who does not have a God he can digest rotten things it will born again scent of God does not have anything to do with the things of the world because he has not got any go anymore he does not go around fussing with a chip on his shoulder wanting to debate and argue about something how many times you seen people in the message argue all the time the unbeliever can believe it so now if anybody want to argue about the serpent see the things and you try to show them they won't listen to it just work away that's why Jesus said you can receive it this is a logic that was spoken in a bubble are you there just leave them alone see God don't argue neither does his children are you for his god brother branham continued here he say oh yes he sat on the same rooster day with the dog they both sit in the same host but one he turned they all crow out speaking about Noah I imagine all the waters was thinking with millions of people swelled bodies rotating upon the water and washes and animals all day the whole world was destroyed and there there was this all dead carcasses falling on top of the order and things like that and the old-growth through them a not grown in or dead body my just fine that's good see eating a dead body why that was his nature how can you live the message today and tomorrow we're insured you will all this time why that was his nature he was a cruel no matter how much his sack with the dog then how much he heard Noah preached he was under the message he was listening to the message our this year twenty years ten years and one of this day they will come a falling away we will open up the crew will have to leave are you there no matter how much he heard Noah preached how much he said with discrete world they thought he was a quote to begin with as soon as he got the opportunity to show his colors he shouted don't be surprised oh no oh this time he never believed them now but when we turn the dogs out when she started out whoo she could not stand up they can give you a message you listen you say you know what turned a message of I don't need to finish even that one I don't even need to waste my time and listening to that this is not my food this is the food of the denomination it's not our food no way she could go she could not find no rest for the sole of her feet so she came back to the earth and that's the waiting sometimes you might be turned loose for a little while to see what you will do but you always if you got the nature of a dog you cannot eat food it's the nature so my brother when the dog brother branham say dead body work salty on the water so he found food that he can feast on but if he was still under this condition you need a universe not what you are trying to impersonate them if you are you are still a crow you find yourself me you find yourself eating dead food you'll find yourself hypocrisy you find yourself aren't you all the time you find yourself on the telephone if you notice cross it on the telephone line they always hello hello they know what happened to church so and so they know what happened to church so and so they know happened teacher some of the message believe I like CNN if you want to know what happened in the message just get in contact with them they are sitting on the telephone pole that's where they eat watching for dead food from the pulpit all the way to the last few even preachers Deacon trust is right everybody you got to get your natural change to make your desires change then how can you do something wrong and you are happy and you claim you believe the message you tell a lie you are mean for 3ma and you go to sleep and you wake up and your conscience is good you learn to people your conscience is good timotei told us they got their conscious theory the Bible said godly sorrow bring them to repentance you do something wrong to somebody and yet you continue then when you truly love God and we here believe him with all your heart when you do anything wrong you feel the tears of repentance rolling down your cheek you can't stand it that's the nature of a child of God either you have to go back did wrong sister I did wrong but you fans people men under political anointing political agenda under grudges under jealousy under backbiting and then still claim to being a message a message you are equal you need your natural change hallelujah you have to go back you lay on your face before God and say God you know I didn't mean to do that and you shall stay right here until it settle with God forever that's right everybody there and the man that is born of the Spirit of God becomes a love of God now say gods that are born of God become a new creature we are friends you are still American on the outside but on the inside your head corner is heaven you are African on the outside you are you know plain on the outside but on the inside you come from God hallelujah his natural he's changed his makeup yes sir you put the spirit of Adolfo in the crew the outside women you want to still be a white man you want to still be a black line you want to still be a panic mode you want to still be whoever you want to call it you still do but the inside the we are same that's why we can fellowship together because we come now from the same father then he never sat on the dead carcass why that crew don't anymore on dead carcass the crew doesn't set any more on dead carcass because his nature has been changed today if he lived down by mistake because the body has now received redemption yet if by any chance you make a mistake whatever him say he certainly get away quick quick to be mouth before you ask forgiveness five years before you ask forgiveness the Bible said that Jesus loved righteousness and hated iniquity therefore I have elevated you above your brother they can not do something wrong to somebody and you are happy he shows that what is in you is wrong get away quick he could not stand a man that is born of the Spirit of God during tolerance he might light in a barrel some time but he said get there who oh my god a woman my touch him get him to turn around but he said turn his head again yeah he said get away from there quick not enjoy enjoy enjoy enjoy until that woman kick you out when you come for repentance Joseph run away you know why he is a dog you aren't going to fool him because that he knows my sheep know my voice and a stranger they will not follow he is a dog to begin with there is what we are speaking about the actual is something that anchor in there if we believe his word then we shall believe we shall live by his word it's our duty if we have a met God not because you say well I go to church I've got to do this you are miserable don't do that why do you want to be a miserable they quipped ungodly cruel for when you could be a Gulf there is a possibility for you to change and yet you don't want to change you want to continue doing bad stuff certainly you just have to have your nature change and you change your nature become a son and daughter of God be at peace with who with God now that was the first aspect of the crew now let's turn our God different because every scripture of a compound meeting do you see why equivocal now let's change our gun differently now if you notice on our storage here we found out that Elijah was fed by the crew the crew of Elijah did not bring rotten food with changing guns it is they were not the crew diet dead food over here the Bible says they were commanded by God they were under the leadership of God they were told them by God over there and the Bible says that both that are the children of God are led by the Spirit of God so these clothes must have the nature already change we are changing direction everybody clear they were bringing bread and meat fresh food not rotten food fresh message the message of the hour not the old town message everybody clear brother branham help me what did I like to do he found a hidden spring way up in the mountain where he got some water of life we find revelations from God as he sit up there under the power of God the revelation being in leader hidden spring while the rest of them were vanishing catch this and God bless his servant why did brother Branham call this servant and they being closed when you look at the scripture superficially you come with a superficial understanding are you there one column said God bless his servants reven so they were not the heaven delivered with the dirty nature of scavenger hypocrite and building he says they brought him something to eat while he was isolated from the people and they were down there publishing furnishing for a revival and all go everybody was in femine he said they didn't know he pulled himself with god out into an isolated place where they didn't hear his voice then they begin to see he ordained ordained destinated commanded leadership of God he or dam dereference this servant members he suffered that kept the voice of Elijah a love doing the tongue of his oscillations the church so there will be some people there will be some clothes there will be some gentle people and another turn away from the message but they're gonna take the message of Elijah and keep them false off a large I rise brother balance ad scroll are his servant if the servant of God they are human things if there are human being when we see the vision Peter we found that that the birds doubles over there where unclean birds over here and the true in Leviticus was an on Twitter so the rules also day so what does this mean we need a prophet the water but the water baptism now then while Peter was on has for quantum at some on detainer he saw a vision because Cornelius a Jetta new remember focus Elijah to Jew Jordan is Jew then - we want to find a connection in the Ministry of Elijah window for the Gentile everybody everybody clear because Cornelius and Gentiles there is a Jew Samaritan now Jacob every oh Jesus dealt with the Jew Jesus dealt with the Samaritan now Jesus is dealing with their few gentle but here okay and Peter was on the housetop taking a little nap before dinner while they was fixing dinner he seen a sheet being lowered down all kind of what unclean creeping animals from the earth was only if you notice because the Holy Spirit's just remind me this now if you note it in the Ark of Noah there was no fish if you notice from the sheet that came from heaven no fish you see the connection okay you just came back or kind of unclean could mean animals from the earth war zone and then when he did that he heard the voice saying rise Peter slain it brother brothers say he was a good presbyterian where is in the scripture you need to see what Presbyterian to do then you understand brother Branham say a good presbyterian are you there okay fifty arise elite he says nothing ever come in my mouth unclean remember the first crow we found out that it's a believer that sit under ministry and then he left he was not a believer to begin with because the Holy Spirit just bring back something again to me ran out if you notice over and under the same roof I'm there now me for a long time they were connected to the family but the dam was come come that is opportunity was given for both of them oppa took that we know and left the message but Ruth cling on to Naomi and Ruth white and she managed both there which is a type of crust and when she gave birth to each other she did not only took the child from roof and then begin to nurse her because the seven show to the projector is the second chopper to DJ and continuously that was your holy spirit the Obama boss remanded odd so let's continue here hallelujah praise God say don't you call unclean water call Oh call oh come on in and clean water clean since dolls because God have to send Peter to the gentle but there was a restriction from them don't get along with the gentle so comes and give me the revision to explain to him like those gentle that you go bad don't call them bad anymore you go there and do what I did and one Peter was speaking the Holy Ghost fell down and baptized the Delta that's why Peter say God have no respect for any person we found that Elijah was interacted with servant and those servant were human and those servant were a top of the Jetta everybody here your first analyzed at you first families at you second lamented you tell Thomas a Jew but the for Tom a window of the Gentiles there where he's entertained by the crew by human being by the servant of God by the judge and not only that after this example he went to a Gentile country where there was a we go again Malachi 4 is not for the Gentile it's footage right see why we built as we moving are you there look at that woman how human must have been a fake a Libra Elijah remember the Bible say that the woman was commanded by God she was under the leadership of God just like the Raven under the leadership of God that's why brother Branham said she must be in a caravan she must be illegal to are you there she must be thank you some substance brother Michael this little woman must have been of the calibre of Elijah because you chose her I love you brother you don't love me let me keep moving and again she had been chosen to entertain God's prophet remember she was her gentle mortal corruption of Raja with the Jetta because the father Raja is a gentle and the land was burning up and no doubt that this little woman bring of that calibre bring off death they believed her type you said she's a gentle she was a believer so it would be a Ministry of Elijah that's going to go to the Gentile believer to the Gentile servant are you there for we see that God could not have called to her if she had not been a worthy want to entertain God's prophet for he would never send his prophet to a house that was unworthy he would never say to the house of Cornelius if the wives of Cornelius was not worthy the Bible said Cornelius was a good lad he pray and the angel met him so God said that is not a gentle that is my child in gentle skin even though they are not Jews but they are my children everybody he was not his choosing grace he was God's choosing he was not your bidding him that woman was not the one say Elijah come here but God sent her who I will send you a large adder I God will send you Elijah I God will send you Elijah that Elijah is said by God that woman did not invite Elijah Elijah will be send by God to the Gentile we are doing a vaccine it was not her bidding him he was God bidding him he had been blessed by the book the revenue were feeding him but he was God command for something to take place and God surely went to a believer of the same nature Elijah that believer was a Gentile is the larger must be of the nature of their so that Elijah must be gentle that just job right now I didn't CDC homie just drop right now I dare show your face denied job Jew second Atlanta Jew tell Elijah Jew from Fallujah Jacob then when we drop on Malachi 4 it's clear how we they are we there I have part 10 already I have part 11 ready now there was a woman in the land neither one of these people know each other but she must have been an honorable woman she must have been the type of woman that Elijah was a man because God chose a woman and of all the women there was even to tell his God lest the Jews left the Jews left the women of the Jews God went to the death woman hallelujah in their own area to remember that woman had to stick right Vera Pauline catch piss in the entryway they use two sticks he was crushed crushed right and the fight was in the middle the engine still use it and when they move the logs happen the cross you know Christ I was in leader that sixel hidden your judgment of the gentle heating rowdy are you there he said perfect friend my prophet witness she won't talk today morning to pick up two sticks and break them just be patient with me I felt check but just be present and put them together see the truth speak is done so this woman is the gentle and she carry the cross when she meets Raja so he takes the classroom to change the dispensation from the jewels to the Jetta that's why while Joseph brings to son Jacob have to cross him Jacob was about to bless them he crossed his hand so that the right hand fell on the younger Joseph cried not so father this is the firstborn to arise by Jack God cross my and here is the last thing which belonged to the firstborn the Jews was given over to the younger the gentle through the cross that's why the gentlewoman carried a cross willful Elijah you need a prophet through the cross cross hand of the Lord Jesus the blessing come through the cross Galatians 3:13 14 currencies everyone that hang on the tree which is the cost that's the blessing of Abraham I come to the Jetta through Jesus Christ the blessing of Abraham came through the cross to the gentle that you rejected the cross idelle Father forgive them they don't know what they're doing and then therefore Jesus get the gentle breath but I will send you Elijah the prophet your first Elijah to second and a Jew to the larger Jew fifth one at you a fourth one is your Jetta everybody now let's head straight to the airport we found out that in the first ministry God gave us a tap here that is going to be visiting the Jetta one day that's why Noah a type of first of all send the crowd a different compound me everybody and the only profit that was entertained by the crew was Elijah is it taking time to catch it is it that in time to catch you catch it the first one Elijah the first one they send the crew and we found the crew ministry when he left to heaven the Ark is a type of heaven because remember the animal were coming from heaven right right the Ark is the top of your heaven either so they have to send the first ministry of the crew to kind of show you that I will visit the gentle one time are you there are you there then the second ministry because the Ministry of the crew happen in the Old Testament but before the end of the Old Testament John the Baptist came and when John was baptizing Jesus Christ we found that the bus was released from heaven I told you if somebody's dying or they love they need CPR and we they we are talking about heaven where the crew is they send the crowd to Allah Old Testament but before the end of the Old Testament we see the Messiah coming when the Messiah coming also happen of no open applicant Noah release the dogs but this Dharma the first partner the dog didn't find any place to claim but this time when the dog was relieved he found that Jesus Christ and he put claim of Jesus Christ and in him dwelleth the fullness of the head Godhead the body of Jesus they dog finally found the rest we clear anybody needs CPR remember the Holy Ghost descended on Jesus we 12 which Jesus was a part of the why the germ of life was they they have to quick imagine the life of God was desiring the womb of a woman Allah with which was the earth all right and then the life of God coming so he was the beginning the beginning of sending the love the beginning of creation of God what for to the earth now it's been justified it's beautiful and are we there and now it has to receive its baptism of fire to be cleansed is bright these are that is Joe out of the earth the earth you are part of the earth your body your soul is part of God an attribute of God display here on the body needs to be rooted deep just like the dog have to come in the body of Jesus Christ and claim the body of Jesus Christ they'd love released the first time find a place this is my only begotten Son in whom I am pleased to dwell because on the Old Testament there was dead body dead body all have sinned and come short from the glory of God but this one is this one I can claim him then the dog come and sit and when he finished his ministry hallelujah when he finished his ministry he went back up and then Noah reach out and hear each other is right handed what did you say and the Bible didn't say it brother branham and put what is written about moses put the hand in the bosom but what this concern now with a voice what the hell buzu he was talking about Moses we have no reason to believe that Moses was left-handed so he must have put his right hand in his bosom because most men huh brother Stephen say my wife say what do you normally say this I get so happy you know so Noah charity's right-handed and what did he do he took the dog back again that's why when Jesus Christ came when he died he rose again when he went to heaven he went to the right hand daughters ride the dog back again to heaven in the right hand man of God his brother Robert still allows the development under the Old Testament the dogs came in Christ claimed he went back again seated in the right hand of God was follow the seven churches discipline seven days no I remember into the ark 1st 2nd 3rd 4th 5th 7 days which are the seven churches seven days seven churches where do you get this stuff you remember the last Thursday night message but you still love your husband must like the way the woman the old has been mastered that your old nature must that now your new husband is the word okay seven days shall bear it 11 brain seven days one as that typify they complete seven church ages seven days over yeah and the whole church ages from the beginning to the end has to be on the word so so you're rollin queens Meggitt Methodist Baptist Pentecostal quiz all dead because our nature are changed we are on the outside Gentile on the outside cruel human mistaken me like pleaded but ask God about me he will tell you when I was converted now leadership seven days that there was not to be living among the people anyone knows that in Exodus no leaven shall be found in your capital seven days that seven day represented the full seven Church then after the seven churches which are suitable are you still alive are we still okay brother Johnny after the seven churches on the Earth Day either on the Earth Day which is the bright edge let's go slowly brother branham the word that fell on the day of Pentecost will not work this day clear no sir that was for pinnacles this is the bride with the jesus' that we are in this world but we are not afterward when you are born again even though you are American but your lifestyle is no more according to America you are living in Egypt but in Egypt there was a place called Ocean he was still under Odisha still in Egypt but separated well they believer are there it is an edge within an edge which is called the bride egg that's why when the angel came down he said thou shall be no more you are no more quicker of time you enter into the earth day F gamma eternity you are in marriage with Jesus Christ but you are still in this world you are in the world but you are not ask the world over there this is for the broad going home of the broad we got something different that's why our message has to be the Pentecostal represented that again we are in the broad edge you are dead to that and you cannot have them we are not living in a place Turkish knowledge this is modern day we are living in an average weather we are laude sure but we are not part of that system but we are still in Goshen in Egypt we need extra days which is the rapture we are living in another age since we are not living in a Methodist age we are living in another age we are living on up here to the bride age they're crawling out of the church and they getting ready together further so Moses take Israel Israel is living in Goshen yet Goshen is in Egypt and they prepare Israel in Goshen for everybody to put the token then they can leave Israel Egypt they can go into the Promised Land we can leave this world we can go into the Roger but before you must be gathered into a different age you must leave now Isha you must leave the system of loudest are you there he says here that we are living upon the broad age they're calling out of the church and getting it together for the rapture that is the age we are living on now - my honest opinion that is exactly the truth so the last days now you see it switched on now it's getting harvest on this is not Luthor Ange this is not Pentecostal age this is the broad age and then we see on the Earth Day which is the brown algae what happened the dog was release again we found out in sunset Mantegna the place that the seven angel fell down God's ended of the servant of chemicals the opening of the seventh year the barber became a new book on the wings of this no I don't know no other way to say it that's no to tell what you are my witness to truth myself Lord oh my own healing in the future I don't know when I don't know how I don't understand about I believe Lord that I received this rain you've never had it off Luther never had it off Wesley never had a dog but in the beginning of pentacles no dog but when the seals open and revelation ten seven fulfill the muddy angel come down when the manager comes down he says there is no time no more he's declaring the Bradish the Earth Day then the seventh dog is released I believe Lord but I receive a son for mobile that's seven dogs and we got here the second time the window forever now open the doggies again release the 7ng soon finish on that Adam oh it is a over I look laying on the pad and they were laying a little squirrel there was a squirrel the mad brother branham suffer all the time and finally the square of came and died and on the spot that that square of that that's where brother Branham fan the seventh dog and he says your enemy is already done the dog came to slay nothing you hear jump out on something merely sit and act of Cola so what key brother branham so inefficient the squirrel jump on him and miss him and when brother branham went on sunset mantle he found that squirrel Dallas envisioned physically death but when that squirrel was dead he hit a bad Cola with these jumping captures and he and dad were

hit a cola-cola is a jumping cutters and the voice of the Lord say your enemy is there I stood there and tremble I took my foot and if you continue the message he must his foot because your enemy must be all your footstool are you there usually in Sunset Mountain put your life jacket again I hope you still alive in that same sunset mountain usually close got a little bit I hope you have enough

passing by we're on sunset mountain everybody everybody the water supplier gets low in my country where I live in trucks on everything out there has got a sticker on it everything you look at health speaker on because there is no other because it's so dry that sticker is a leaf roll together that's the mystery of the cactus okay so tight and so sharp there is no instrument could be grounded like that no instrument could be ground like a jumping cactus the one that kill it are you there because it's got bird on a little hook and all the way to the end it should jump right at you that's why

dead the enemy of God random dead who is our enemy if it is against God's world against the world don't bring me idea I think we need to do this business if it's against the message it's my enemy you know in the morning they both went to sunset mountain he finished the ministry of the seven field then he goes back to the Israel because Israel is an olive tree he goes to the olive tree under Moses and Elijah and then he talked to Moses and Elijah and then when he finished he picked up the leaf to come back but level because the seventh seal the angel descended he deal with the gentle when he finished as the seventh year he goes to the Jews as the seventh trumpet when that door finished then he goes back again to heaven he waited for several other days he send it out like that but he said help my friend and then when she went out there directed by who she so she was in Israel now dealing with the Jews under Moses and Elijah when she finishes she pick up a leaf and flew back and peck at the window God use a door for a sign she came back saying that the fraud is now I have finished Redemption with you Jewish people are you there that's your seventh trumpet or are there God Himself represented on the earth we came in the form of the most biggest bird flies to heaven the God the God is a peculiar way it's a different bird from all other world many times and we noticed that they love also is it of what he brought his Vizier is destroyed then he is going back to the Father he said father finish the job now which piece are you there the dog come back represented if no leaf live in his because he finished his ministry with Moses and Elijah and after that no aware that again what what are these seven days he still enough I'm almost dropping in the airport are you seen enough okay seven days the millennium start off his burn and then the introduction of the millennium because brother Branham said the seventh seal when he goes he finished the trumpet he finished the file he finished the seven churches he finished with Israel and he is sharing the introduction to the millennium where do you get seven days with a millennium Radha Branham all right let's take the last feast which is mr. fort Quranic oh he gives the scripture seven days not facilitated seven days shall you offer offering made by fire unto the world and all the earth the seven days with Israel then there is another are you still enough okay the holy convocation notice by Banamex friendís seven days only has to do with the old creation work done seven days that is death rest day as God delivered six days rested on the seventh day the church labor six days and rested on there but you are still in time element because it's a thousand years everybody fear everybody clear so on the Earth Day there is another holy cow just where the scripture release the Dove for the last time but this time when they'd of Italy leaves the Dove don't come back again to heaven why is not the Dove not coming back after the holy convocation of the millennium why is not the Dove coming back now we got HD there is only seven days but we'll speak of the eighty a holy convocation convocation notice do not work in it 8b ah what back to the first day why speak of what because God have finished with the devil finish with everything now the New Jerusalem is coming down the tabernacle of God is no longer in heaven God comes down to live in the earth they don't stay now alpha he doesn't go back again either it speak of eternity I see well done without stopping place stay of tabernacle after the last complete seven days upon the earth after the Millenium but this holy convocation comes welcomes the cities coming down as a pyramid ship God left heaven now God is coming to inhabit the earth forever the Dove is released for the last time he doesn't come back to the Ark of Noah because it doesn't come back to the Ark of Noah Noah remove the cover the Bible said the first half and will be removed it will be a new heaven no I don't need that anymore the dog is out God forever will be living with us on earth let me get this again and we finished the tabernacle of God is with men the former things have passed away this means that heaven come down to resident he come down to say God become a permanent resident of the earth God began to have a green card of the earth [Applause] he can to eat go to resident with men see heaven and in earth water embrace just exactly when they does come upon the part of the earth which was Jesus he was the dust of the earth because what man now the city LaMontagne the New Jerusalem there is nothing destroying there there you are there is the paradises of God the light of the world that perfect kingdom they eternal one not the millennium then you earth Noah enter into the new earth the water dried up John say they won't be no see there will be a new heaven there is very new claim a new beginning then the Dove is really he started from the river they revered under Elijah then he comes to believe the dog under Jesus Christ and the Jesus Christ he claimed come and claim the earth Jesus goes back again to the right hand of God then the seven churches and the eighth day the doggies released on sunset mountain he finished our ministry he goes to Israel on the olive tree when he comes back the millennium started after 1000 years because Adam never completed 1,000 years when we complete 1000 years which is a day with the Lord then the city comes the dog is released God comes down and now live with men that is the end of our
