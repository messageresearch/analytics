[0:00] that he's been able to do to build a
[0:02] beautiful homes like up on Campbell's
[0:04] Back Mountain Cavalier mountain is a
[0:07] pass through there a 35 years ago that
[0:10] was a desert we run Burrows through
[0:12] their own horseback and over on South
[0:14] Mountain here chasing Burrows the horses
[0:18] and now it's become a great metropolitan
[0:21] area of this great fabulous City that's
[0:25] growing into the tens of thousands times
[0:27] thousands just stretched out until now
[0:30] their own decay of the Cities bring it
[0:33] to a chaos smogs coming in your humidity
[0:37] is as bad as it is in Jeffersonville
[0:38] Indiana and Ohio valleys irrigation man
[0:42] always pollutes the world
[0:46] when the Indians had it it was a
[0:49] beautiful place but when white men come
[0:51] in he brought his sins and liquor and
[0:53] immorality and he's polluted the lands
[0:55] that has become nothing but a almost
[0:58] assessed pool
[1:02] what a thing to look up on God will wipe
[1:07] it from the face of the Earth one of
[1:09] these days
[1:11] and he's choosing a people of Ryan
[1:14] righteousness that shall reign upon the
[1:17] Earth As He Reigns his King he is now
[1:22] taking his people for his name
[1:24] the people for his kingdom
[1:28] now
[1:29] would this smart
[1:32] intelligent
[1:33] intellectual group of Israel it's great
[1:39] powerful intellectual president or King
[1:42] jeroboam
[1:45] who was a smart man
[1:48] and
[1:49] what they hear this little unknown
[1:53] problem
[1:55] would this great message that's burning
[1:59] in his heart
[2:01] would he be able to walk through the
[2:03] streets and the people with women would
[2:06] dress themselves nicely again A man
[2:09] should leave the taverns and the places
[2:11] of sin and turn to God at the preacher
[2:15] this little unknown fella
[2:18] that was a question might have come into
[2:20] his mind or does mine when I seen
[2:23] standing there in his little bald heads
[2:25] shining in the sun his Gray beard
[2:27] hanging around his coat looking down
[2:30] through there and looking up on that sit
[2:32] in his air eyes narrowing his heart
[2:35] beaten
[2:36] yet and I saw the kingdom of God that
[2:40] should be established there all waited
[2:43] in sin and with the rebuke from God that
[2:47] would rebuke from the King to the beggar
[2:50] in the street
[2:51] every priest preacher King potentate
[2:55] Monarch whatever he was he had the curse
[2:58] of God to put on him because
[3:00] they would receive him on
[3:05] whether you're understanding
[3:07] remember he had no recommendation he
[3:11] come different from our evangelists of
[3:13] the day
[3:14] he had no recommendation from the priest
[3:18] they didn't even know who the fellow was
[3:21] but there's one who knowed who he was
[3:25] as the one that's standing
[3:28] that's all counted to him
[3:30] as long as he knows where he was sent
[3:33] from
[3:34] his message had to go forth just the
[3:36] same
[3:38] and regardless
[3:41] he had no denominational credentials to
[3:44] back him up when he went into the city
[3:45] to come to the Ministerial Association
[3:48] and say my brethren I
[3:50] of this certain group this religious
[3:52] group I belonged to the certain certain
[3:55] he had not that foreign
[4:01] neither did he had a fellowship card
[4:03] the show that he even stood in good
[4:05] fellowship with the minister of
[4:07] associations from the country came from
[4:10] [Music]
[4:14] yaddle cooperation for his campaign
[4:20] you never even consulted anybody about
[4:22] it
[4:26] that little fella was standing in a
[4:28] difficult place
[4:30] it'd be enough for a man to turn and go
[4:33] back
[4:35] and take up his hurt again
[4:38] don't take off where you left if he was
[4:41] just a thought but you see the man
[4:44] didn't take no second thought
[4:47] he didn't think about any credentials
[4:51] neither did he think about a fellowship
[4:53] card
[4:54] he only thought about one thing and that
[4:57] was the word of the Lord
[4:59] God had given a dream of the charge that
[5:02] he must go over there and prophesy
[5:06] that's all made any difference to him
[5:09] he had the word of the Lord
[5:11] and therefore he felt he didn't need
[5:13] credentials or any recommendation or any
[5:16] cooperation the only thing he needed was
[5:19] he had cooperation with God and that's
[5:22] all it took
[5:23] long as he was in the will of the Lord
[5:25] what differs did it make
[5:27] as long as he know that his message was
[5:29] from God God would vindicate that
[5:32] message you had to
[5:36] and when he broke the message it looks
[5:39] like
[5:40] that there would be a all the priests
[5:43] and preachers and the prophets of that
[5:45] age would have come and repented because
[5:48] they would have seen the condition of
[5:50] the place the scene the moral corruption
[5:53] but when you begin to prophesy with the
[5:56] word of the Lord it was thought

[56:44] get to stand in the presence of God's
[56:47] children this evening amen
[56:50] now if we could I'd like to just go into
[56:52] the scripture
[56:53] turn with me over to the book of Saint
[56:55] Luke
[56:58] the 18th chapter
[57:03] Saint Luke the 18th chapter
[57:18] let us begin reading at the ninth verse
[57:23] amen Jesus here and he spake this
[57:27] Parable unto certain which trusted in
[57:31] themselves
[57:33] that they were righteous
[57:36] and despised others
[57:39] notice the Lord himself is speaking a
[57:42] parable
[57:44] these aren't necessarily real people
[57:45] he's talking about but he's given them a
[57:47] a story
[57:50] parable
[57:52] and who he's talking to them
[57:55] that trusted in themselves
[57:59] and they despised others
[58:01] two men went up into the temple to pray
[58:04] the one a Pharisee and the other
[58:07] Republican
[58:08] the Pharisees stood and prayed thus with
[58:11] himself God I thank thee
[58:13] that I am not as other men are
[58:16] extortioners unjust adulterers or even
[58:20] as this publican
[58:22] I fast twice in the week I give tiles of
[58:26] all that I possess
[58:29] and the publican
[58:31] standing afar off
[58:35] would not lift up so much as his eyes
[58:37] unto heaven
[58:39] but smote upon his breast
[58:43] saying God
[58:45] be merciful
[58:47] to me a sinner
[58:51] and Jesus said I tell you this man went
[58:54] down to his house Justified
[58:59] Justified rather than the other for
[59:02] everyone that exalteth himself shall be
[59:05] amazed and he that humbleth himself
[59:08] shall be exalted dear heavenly father we
[59:12] thank you tonight God
[59:15] Lord that you'd call upon us father but
[59:19] Lord in this word that we've read in
[59:21] this time that has set aside God we pray
[59:24] father for your presence
[59:26] God that made these lips of clay speak
[59:28] only thy words let us not run asunder in
[59:32] our own faults
[59:34] but God let every heart
[59:36] be thinking upon you continually
[59:39] let us humble ourselves tonight under
[59:41] Thy Word
[59:42] God that we might receive of thy kingdom
[59:45] let it become tonight father we pray and
[59:49] bless every heart every need
[59:52] God and let it our ears be inclined to
[59:55] hear you this evening in Jesus Christ's
[59:57] name
[59:58] amen and amen you might have your seat
[1:00:02] and I'd like to look tonight if I could
[1:00:04] upon this scripture
[1:00:06] and the Lord is laid upon my heart
[1:00:09] this title that when Grace
[1:00:13] reveals Mercy
[1:00:16] when Grace reveals Mercy tonight
[1:00:20] when we look at when is a Time
[1:00:24] is a time when there becomes a a certain
[1:00:27] time Grace
[1:00:29] is the
[1:00:31] unmerited favor
[1:00:34] of a living God
[1:00:39] unmerited favor election I would call it
[1:00:42] Grace is the election of God Upon A
[1:00:45] people
[1:00:46] Grace was the election of God that
[1:00:48] looked upon Moses and he found Grace in
[1:00:50] the sight of God
[1:00:52] when he looked upon the whole earth that
[1:00:54] he couldn't see anything there but he
[1:00:56] saw Noah
[1:00:57] and something of Noah found a Grace in
[1:01:00] the sight of God I believe Noah's name
[1:01:03] was written in a book somewhere and God
[1:01:06] said this name is going to carry forth
[1:01:08] my very word in this hour
[1:01:11] and by that Grace that that God had
[1:01:15] chosen he revealed unto Noah the mercies
[1:01:18] of God in the midst of the Judgment that
[1:01:21] was coming upon the Earth
[1:01:24] and it was at that time when all of the
[1:01:26] sin had heaped up when that when we
[1:01:28] would say in this hour that the cup of
[1:01:30] the amorites had come to fulfillment and
[1:01:33] was overflowing that God would look and
[1:01:36] he would have Grace and his election
[1:01:37] would stand that he would find Noah
[1:01:41] there in the midst of it he would reveal
[1:01:43] Mercy unto Noah that would show him a
[1:01:46] way out
[1:01:47] of the Judgment that was coming upon the
[1:01:49] face of the Earth
[1:01:51] and so to look upon this
[1:01:54] we would look and we would see that
[1:01:56] Jesus has given a a parable
[1:02:00] it's not not necessarily two real people
[1:02:03] but it's it's God expressing himself and
[1:02:06] showing to to those there that thought
[1:02:08] that they were righteous in their self
[1:02:11] they thought that what they were going
[1:02:12] to do was going to achieve something
[1:02:15] great
[1:02:16] but yet Jesus comes and he gives the
[1:02:18] parable of I don't know I want to look
[1:02:20] not at the Pharisee but I want to look
[1:02:22] at that public and that was standing
[1:02:24] there
[1:02:25] he was standing to where he couldn't
[1:02:27] even approach it would seem that he
[1:02:29] would stand afar off he'd come into the
[1:02:31] temple but he didn't enter in so much
[1:02:33] but he he would he would stand afar off
[1:02:36] and he wouldn't he wouldn't wasn't even
[1:02:38] able to raise his head up to heaven to
[1:02:41] look into the face of the one that he
[1:02:43] was come to
[1:02:44] him but as he bowed his head and he beat
[1:02:46] upon his breast
[1:02:48] and this here was an Israelite this here
[1:02:51] was that God was referencing was just a
[1:02:54] a an Israelite that would understand the
[1:02:56] laws and he would understand the the
[1:02:58] offerings and he'd understand the
[1:03:00] Tabernacle in a in a sense of of he had
[1:03:03] been raised up and he'd understand all
[1:03:05] the all the all the ins and the outs all
[1:03:08] the all the eyes that were dotted all
[1:03:10] the t's that were crossed he would he
[1:03:12] would had been raised to understand he
[1:03:14] wasn't a Pharisee but yet he was still
[1:03:15] an Israelite
[1:03:17] he knew the laws of what they were he
[1:03:19] knew the understanding of the Tabernacle
[1:03:22] he knew how that the priest could
[1:03:24] approach into that place of Mercy
[1:03:28] and so he stands there and he cries out
[1:03:30] he beats upon his breast and he cries
[1:03:32] out and he said Lord God be merciful
[1:03:37] merciful
[1:03:38] Mercy he was looking for a place to find
[1:03:41] Mercy from God because in his life he
[1:03:45] understood that Mercy he wasn't just
[1:03:48] talking about just any Mercy but you
[1:03:50] followed that through and he was looking
[1:03:52] for a place of where that Mercy Seat
[1:03:54] laid
[1:03:56] he was looking for that Mercy Seat
[1:04:01] and this was The Mercy Seat standing
[1:04:04] there tarot telling the parable
[1:04:06] of a republican of a somebody that would
[1:04:09] understand about a mercy seat
[1:04:12] and he would be crying out and show me
[1:04:15] mercy show me the entrance into the
[1:04:18] place of Mercy show me an Open Door a
[1:04:22] place that God has been sprinkled with
[1:04:24] the blood of an innocent one show me a
[1:04:27] place God that I can release all of my
[1:04:30] cares somewhere God that I can find an
[1:04:33] atonement show me God where I can find
[1:04:36] my position in this place
[1:04:40] foreign
[1:04:42] and and we see this
[1:04:47] and this is what I'm that that I look
[1:04:50] upon and we see that here
[1:04:53] it wasn't just a a mercy of
[1:04:57] Lord be Mercy you know
[1:05:01] you know Lord just just lift a little
[1:05:04] burden and be merciful but this was
[1:05:07] this was a cry for show me that Mercy
[1:05:10] that show me that perpetuation
[1:05:13] that perpetuation that is a continual
[1:05:16] God where that blood was sprinkled to
[1:05:19] where I know that all of the sins of the
[1:05:21] past all of the sins of the present all
[1:05:24] of the sins of the future show me the
[1:05:27] place of perpetuation show me the blood
[1:05:30] that is the perpetuation show me the
[1:05:33] just God that has given a just law but
[1:05:37] not only that but he gave a just
[1:05:39] fulfillment to that law
[1:05:43] show me a God show me a place God that
[1:05:46] where all of my burdens yes
[1:05:50] are covered all of my all of my
[1:05:54] oppression is relieved all of my sin is
[1:05:58] dealt with all of my fears are
[1:06:01] vanquished show me God
[1:06:04] reveal unto me your mercy
[1:06:08] and you know Revelation isn't something
[1:06:10] we just learn about
[1:06:11] because this man had known about it the
[1:06:14] public the the Pharisee understood it
[1:06:16] the Pharisee had set in church all his
[1:06:19] life
[1:06:20] he wasn't even looking for Mercy because
[1:06:23] he thought he had done worked his way
[1:06:24] into it but this man was looking for
[1:06:27] Mercy he was looking for a place
[1:06:33] and mercy is that release
[1:06:36] amen Mercy is that release you know it
[1:06:39] reminds me of a time that that an eagle
[1:06:41] found himself scratching in a barnyard
[1:06:44] amen and he was looking for a release of
[1:06:48] that burden of this that was nothing of
[1:06:51] his very nature
[1:06:53] you know he'd go over here and he'd
[1:06:55] nibble a little bit and it didn't
[1:06:57] satisfy
[1:06:58] he'd walk over here and talk to this
[1:07:00] group and he'd try to talk to him and
[1:07:02] they'd cluck back at him amen he'd go
[1:07:06] over here and you know he'd look at he'd
[1:07:08] stand beside of him and somebody would
[1:07:09] snap a picture and he didn't look like
[1:07:11] they looked he'd go and they'd look in
[1:07:13] the same mirror and they'd stand side by
[1:07:15] side and they'd look one way but he'd
[1:07:18] look another way
[1:07:19] hey man he was birding with something
[1:07:22] that you couldn't explain
[1:07:24] he was burdened with something amen that
[1:07:27] nothing could teach him out of it they
[1:07:31] were trying to teach him you hold your
[1:07:32] beak down like this and you and you plug
[1:07:34] down like this
[1:07:36] but he just couldn't he he couldn't he
[1:07:39] couldn't conform to that image
[1:07:43] amen he couldn't conform to what
[1:07:45] everybody else wanted him to conform to
[1:07:47] and he was seeking mercy God
[1:07:51] show me your mercy and and deliver me
[1:07:54] from this vile place that I'm under
[1:08:00] to give me a revelation God
[1:08:04] I'm not satisfied with with these with
[1:08:07] these chickens teaching me all about
[1:08:10] what an out to me
[1:08:12] see it was deeper than that
[1:08:16] it was deeper than that there was a bird
[1:08:18] and there was a long and that that
[1:08:20] public and that public and when he he
[1:08:23] stood afar off in the temple he really
[1:08:27] wasn't like the rest of them he couldn't
[1:08:30] even lift his head up and praise in the
[1:08:32] midst of all that they were doing
[1:08:33] because he knew in him seeing new in
[1:08:36] reality that all of this workings all of
[1:08:39] this carrying on wasn't going to satisfy
[1:08:43] God opened mine I revealed to me
[1:08:47] give me Revelation
[1:08:49] I don't want knowledge I want revelation
[1:08:52] I don't want a head knowledge but God
[1:08:55] give me the very knowledge of the Living
[1:08:57] God
[1:08:58] [Applause]
[1:09:05] burden in the desire
[1:09:08] design of this that the word of Jesus
[1:09:12] himself standing there where did this
[1:09:14] story come from
[1:09:16] where did that story come from he wasn't
[1:09:19] just just making up some story but but
[1:09:21] God himself was delivering a parable a
[1:09:24] story
[1:09:25] of the very burden of the heart of what
[1:09:28] he had come to give answer to
[1:09:31] amen there was a question there was a
[1:09:33] question who are these what do these are
[1:09:35] right but he was the one that asked the
[1:09:37] question but he was the same one that
[1:09:39] had the answer
[1:09:44] Hosea would find over in the book of
[1:09:46] Hosea chapter 6.
[1:09:49] we'd find over there and as we look
[1:09:51] there in Hosea chapter 6.
[1:09:54] we find them talking of of the remnant
[1:09:56] they're talking about my how great and
[1:09:58] and how God's going to give Deliverance
[1:10:00] in the first but he comes down to the
[1:10:05] the sixth verse
[1:10:07] and he says and this is God being in
[1:10:10] response and he's talking about Ephraim
[1:10:12] and how that my their goodness is like
[1:10:14] the morning Cloud it just vanishes away
[1:10:17] under the heat of the Sun
[1:10:19] and he says in verse 6 for I
[1:10:22] desired Mercy
[1:10:26] I desired Mercy
[1:10:29] and not sacrifice
[1:10:31] this was the god that had given them the
[1:10:34] law of sacrifice
[1:10:36] and to where they had sacrificed and
[1:10:38] sacrificed and sacrificed and sacrificed
[1:10:41] until it became a stink in the nostrils
[1:10:43] of God
[1:10:44] for he desired Mercy
[1:10:47] he desired Mercy
[1:10:51] he desired that mercy and not sacrifice
[1:10:55] and the knowledge of God more than burnt
[1:11:00] offerings
[1:11:01] that knowledge of God is not a head
[1:11:04] knowledge
[1:11:05] but it is a a recognition
[1:11:09] of a living God I'd say it like this in
[1:11:12] this hour it is the recognition
[1:11:15] of your message and your day
[1:11:20] somebody that can recognize that God
[1:11:22] that was standing present not a god of a
[1:11:25] book or a law or a tradition not a god
[1:11:28] of somewhere in the future but to
[1:11:31] recognize God standing in their midst
[1:11:36] because God wanted somebody to
[1:11:38] fellowship with
[1:11:40] he wanted somebody not to be able to do
[1:11:43] it on their own but to come and cry for
[1:11:45] mercy
[1:11:46] he wanted to show somebody the love of
[1:11:49] almighty God the mercy that would show
[1:11:51] them who they really are
[1:11:53] and to acknowledge
[1:11:55] who he is
[1:11:58] who he is
[1:12:00] so it's not that uh that the works would
[1:12:02] get us there it's not the ability of our
[1:12:04] ourselves to attain it's not
[1:12:07] how long I've been in it but it's
[1:12:10] God that you would give a revelation
[1:12:14] of Mercy that your election would show
[1:12:16] your people
[1:12:18] who
[1:12:19] and what
[1:12:20] has given them their freedom
[1:12:23] you know job one time
[1:12:26] job you look at job and you and you and
[1:12:28] you find that job was was was a man that
[1:12:32] that needed Mercy
[1:12:34] he needed he was under a a place in the
[1:12:37] whole book of Job and and you can read
[1:12:39] it and I know we have and we've studied
[1:12:41] it but you look at job and job the whole
[1:12:44] book of Job is a showing
[1:12:47] of what man and the Devil Himself had
[1:12:50] presented to man that if if if God is
[1:12:53] good to you you'll serve him
[1:12:56] and if you're good God will be good to
[1:12:58] you
[1:13:01] and so job
[1:13:02] in all of us and job is way before the
[1:13:05] law
[1:13:06] it's given way before the law so job's
[1:13:09] not running on just law he's running on
[1:13:11] tradition of what the devil had
[1:13:14] implemented in the Garden of Eden that
[1:13:16] you do this and you get this you do that
[1:13:19] and you understand this you take this
[1:13:21] and you become as God
[1:13:25] laughs
[1:13:27] see so it always placed in the heart of
[1:13:29] man trying to attain to something
[1:13:32] and so job The Book of Job was all about
[1:13:35] somebody trying to obtain under the
[1:13:37] under the place of God but as job was
[1:13:40] there he was found of God and he was
[1:13:42] found a place of that he was perfect and
[1:13:45] astute evil and he was he was in the
[1:13:48] sense of everybody else he lived a
[1:13:50] higher place
[1:13:52] but then so the devil come to God and
[1:13:55] and and and and said now if you take all
[1:13:57] of this away he won't serve you foreign
[1:14:03] he didn't know the truth
[1:14:06] of what was leading job
[1:14:09] so Joe
[1:14:12] had offered a sacrifice a burnt offering
[1:14:14] notice he had burnt us offering for his
[1:14:17] kids and all of his family in case that
[1:14:19] they did something or got somewhere he
[1:14:21] had a burnt offering
[1:14:23] and so we know the story The Devil
[1:14:25] coming he took everything under the hand
[1:14:27] of God he took everything this and that
[1:14:29] and and then we find job and this is
[1:14:31] where I want you to look we find job
[1:14:34] sitting on an ash Heap
[1:14:37] and he's scratching himself with a pot
[1:14:40] shirt he's he's got this utensil that
[1:14:43] he's scratching and he's oozing and and
[1:14:45] he's under this this this place of
[1:14:49] where all my friends now
[1:14:52] they didn't want to come to him because
[1:14:54] he was filthy and dirty now
[1:14:57] they thought man this was the this was
[1:14:59] the one that everybody come to ask
[1:15:00] question this is the one that every body
[1:15:02] comes seeking wisdom but now nobody
[1:15:04] would even come talk to him to where
[1:15:06] even his wife would sit there and say
[1:15:08] Joe why don't you just Curse God and die
[1:15:11] but job was sitting there and I want you
[1:15:13] to look at where he was sitting on that
[1:15:15] Ash Heat
[1:15:17] but as he you look at what was it it was
[1:15:20] a remnants of a burnt offering
[1:15:22] and what was job and his heart doing job
[1:15:25] was taking all that he could muster and
[1:15:28] he was trying to return back to where he
[1:15:32] knew God was because he thought maybe I
[1:15:35] left him somewhere maybe I've ran off
[1:15:38] from him maybe I maybe there's something
[1:15:41] I can do so job in all of his humility
[1:15:45] runs back to the ash pal and he gets
[1:15:48] down in that ass pile and he's seeking
[1:15:50] God with all that is within him and he's
[1:15:53] not finding the answer
[1:15:56] foreign
[1:15:58] but he finds three friends that come to
[1:16:01] him amen and one comes he's a
[1:16:04] Pentecostal like none other he says
[1:16:06] listen Joe
[1:16:07] Ma I woke up in the night and I saw a
[1:16:10] vision and man I felt chills run all
[1:16:12] over my body
[1:16:14] and so you listen to me job I've got the
[1:16:16] answer for you I'm going to teach you
[1:16:19] how that you can get out of this
[1:16:21] situation
[1:16:23] another of his friends said listen to
[1:16:25] her we've got Traditions to handle this
[1:16:27] we've got a long list of church
[1:16:30] Traditions that if you do this this is
[1:16:32] going to lift and you'll be okay
[1:16:34] another one come to job and he said
[1:16:37] listen job I don't know how it is but I
[1:16:39] just know
[1:16:40] and if you do what I say
[1:16:42] and do it perfectly you're going to get
[1:16:45] you're going to get delivered
[1:16:47] and so they sat and we know the story
[1:16:49] they they talked around everywhere they
[1:16:52] talked and they talked and they talked
[1:16:57] but then one day God come
[1:16:59] one day God
[1:17:02] and he asked job he said job he said
[1:17:05] you've been talking about all of this
[1:17:07] you've been discussing things you had no
[1:17:09] knowledge of but he said I want uh job I
[1:17:11] want you now to pull up your bootstraps
[1:17:14] I want you to stand here like a man and
[1:17:17] I'm going to ask you a question where
[1:17:19] were you Joe
[1:17:21] whatever you when I called for the sun
[1:17:23] to rise where were you when I fed every
[1:17:26] beast in the field where were you job if
[1:17:29] you're so perfect
[1:17:31] if you're so right Joe where were you
[1:17:34] and all of this brother Brandon would
[1:17:36] say that here he was taking job to a
[1:17:38] lower level and showing job who he
[1:17:40] really was
[1:17:44] and then and then we find job I want you
[1:17:46] to notice where we find job then after
[1:17:48] God talks to him
[1:17:51] hot dogs joke we find job over there at
[1:17:53] 10 and what is he doing he is repenting
[1:17:56] he is him hard with himself and he is
[1:17:58] repenting where in dust and Ashes
[1:18:03] because he recognizes Abraham who am I
[1:18:06] talking to God but dust
[1:18:10] who am I he said I have uttered things
[1:18:12] that I don't know
[1:18:15] and right there he said I have heard
[1:18:18] but now I see
[1:18:21] and when the revelation of Mercy comes
[1:18:24] by grace that God has chosen a time he
[1:18:28] has chosen a place and he is chosen a
[1:18:31] people that he is going to express his
[1:18:33] Mercy to
[1:18:36] so when Grace reveals Mercy it changes
[1:18:39] the situation
[1:18:41] but it's the revealing of that Mercy
[1:18:45] that is shown and you watch job how that
[1:18:48] he changed everything about him changed
[1:18:51] he changed I want to read I want to read
[1:18:53] over and look because there is as as
[1:18:56] Hosea would say that my I desired mercy
[1:18:59] and not sacrifice the knowledge the
[1:19:00] recognition of God more than burnt
[1:19:03] offerings and Jesus would talk to him
[1:19:05] over in Matthew the ninth chapter and
[1:19:07] the 12th verse
[1:19:08] and they were talking about why do why
[1:19:11] does why does this happen why do your
[1:19:13] disciples do this why do you eat
[1:19:14] Republicans and sinners why do you
[1:19:16] mingle with this crowd
[1:19:19] and he'd say but when Jesus heard that
[1:19:21] he said unto them that they that behold
[1:19:23] need not a physician but they that are
[1:19:26] sick
[1:19:27] but go ye and learn what that meaneth I
[1:19:30] will have mercy and not sacrifice for I
[1:19:33] am not come to call the righteous but
[1:19:35] Sinners to repentance
[1:19:38] there's a place that brings us to an
[1:19:41] understanding a revelation
[1:19:44] a revelation changes
[1:19:49] the situation
[1:19:52] all that we can learn of our own ability
[1:19:54] all that we can study of tradition all
[1:19:58] that we can gather of our own ability
[1:20:00] will lead us to not
[1:20:02] but when Revelation comes
[1:20:05] when Revelation comes
[1:20:10] then it all changes
[1:20:12] it all changes now watch when you go to
[1:20:15] that and that Republican he was looking
[1:20:16] at that Mercy Seat he was looking for a
[1:20:18] place of Mercy
[1:20:20] and over and over in Romans chapter 3 in
[1:20:24] the perpetuation on read in verse 22
[1:20:26] even
[1:20:27] the righteousness of God which is by
[1:20:30] faith
[1:20:32] we know bioluminescence faith is a
[1:20:34] revelation
[1:20:36] it's not something we must it's not
[1:20:38] something we work it's not something
[1:20:40] that we can we can we can do this this
[1:20:42] and this and gather Faith but it is a
[1:20:45] revelation
[1:20:46] given by God Alone
[1:20:50] amen
[1:20:52] which is by faith of Jesus Christ
[1:20:56] unto all and above all them that believe
[1:21:01] for there is no difference
[1:21:04] for all have sinned and come short of
[1:21:07] the glory of God
[1:21:08] what being justified freely by his grace
[1:21:13] through the Redemption that is in Christ
[1:21:16] Jesus
[1:21:18] whom God has set forth to be a
[1:21:20] perpetuation
[1:21:22] there he is
[1:21:24] there he is
[1:21:26] there is that Mercy that that public and
[1:21:29] Jesus was expressing through that
[1:21:31] Republican he was looking for this this
[1:21:35] is what mankind is looking for
[1:21:39] but even more than just mankind but the
[1:21:42] Bride of Jesus Christ is looking for
[1:21:45] that Mercy above everything
[1:21:47] [Music]
[1:21:49] they're looking for that place of
[1:21:51] perpetuation the Prophet would even
[1:21:52] preach a message that God's provided
[1:21:55] place of worship
[1:21:58] there's no other place it's got to be in
[1:22:01] there
[1:22:02] it's got to be in there where it's
[1:22:04] granted it's not granted just in a
[1:22:06] church building it's not granted under
[1:22:08] some School of Theology it's not granted
[1:22:10] under my good tutorship of raising a
[1:22:13] child it is granted by the mercies of
[1:22:16] almighty God and the election of God
[1:22:19] what
[1:22:20] whom God has set forth to be the
[1:22:22] perpetuation through faith in his blood
[1:22:25] through the Revelation in his blood
[1:22:28] to declare his righteousness for the
[1:22:32] remission of sins that are passed
[1:22:34] through the forbearance of God to
[1:22:37] declare I say at this time his
[1:22:39] righteousness that he might be just
[1:22:44] who God
[1:22:48] has to be just
[1:22:51] that he might be just
[1:22:54] and the justifier
[1:22:57] of him which believeth in Jesus
[1:23:00] now you go into you go back into Exodus
[1:23:03] the 25th chapter and we begin to look
[1:23:05] and we see the the the Tabernacle and
[1:23:07] god-given direction to Moses and he's
[1:23:09] telling him all about the the the
[1:23:11] Tabernacle and the place and Heaven he
[1:23:13] puts it in there and he establishes the
[1:23:15] place of The Mercy Seat
[1:23:18] amen he establishes the place in Exodus
[1:23:21] 25 and 22. and he's built it all up he's
[1:23:24] expressed the golden and overlaying the
[1:23:26] cherubims and placed in there for wings
[1:23:27] up over the top of it and lay in The
[1:23:29] Mercy Seat in verse 22 and God says and
[1:23:32] there I will meet with thee
[1:23:35] foreign
[1:23:56] that he was going to give and there he
[1:23:59] tells and expresses there in the Old
[1:24:01] Testament in Exodus 22 there I will meet
[1:24:04] with thee and I will commune with thee
[1:24:07] from Above The Mercy Seat
[1:24:09] now if Jesus himself the word of God was
[1:24:12] talking about this public and that was
[1:24:13] expressing a desire for this Mercy Seat
[1:24:17] to see this Mercy Seat he'd heard about
[1:24:21] it
[1:24:23] he had been told stories about it he had
[1:24:26] studied about it he has there had been
[1:24:28] offerings on it for him
[1:24:34] but it ain't the same
[1:24:37] it's not the same
[1:24:40] when you're just hearing about it job
[1:24:43] heard about it
[1:24:45] but he had to see it
[1:24:48] had to see it
[1:24:50] had to see it
[1:24:54] what she said
[1:24:56] Above The Mercy Seat from between the
[1:24:58] two cherubims which are upon the Ark of
[1:25:00] the testimony of all things which I will
[1:25:04] give thee in commandment unto the
[1:25:07] children of Israel now here he's telling
[1:25:09] Moses he said in this place I'm going to
[1:25:11] meet you
[1:25:12] under the under the under the wings of
[1:25:15] the cherubims
[1:25:16] in between there
[1:25:18] Above The Mercy Seat
[1:25:20] and then you go back and you study the
[1:25:22] mercy said I'm sure the pastor here's
[1:25:24] preached on it how did The Mercy Seat
[1:25:26] was sprinkled out of the air and the
[1:25:27] priests would come in the high priest
[1:25:29] would come in and he had taken he'd take
[1:25:31] the two uh bullets and he'd bring one
[1:25:34] for himself he'd bring one for the
[1:25:36] congregation he'd bring in the realm for
[1:25:39] the sins of the whole thing and he would
[1:25:41] bring him and he would bring the fire
[1:25:42] and he'd place it upon the presence and
[1:25:45] in the presence there upon that Holy
[1:25:46] Fire it burst up into a into a cloud or
[1:25:49] a a sweetened smell and it would burst
[1:25:51] up and he would sprinkle that mercy seat
[1:25:54] seven times over with the blood and as
[1:25:56] he was sprinkling that blood what was it
[1:25:58] doing it was making an atonement for
[1:26:00] adjustment that God could come and dwell
[1:26:03] in the place where he's so long to dwell
[1:26:07] the low is not to keep man away but the
[1:26:10] low is to make provision so that God
[1:26:13] could have Fellowship that God could
[1:26:16] come down and talk and fellowship with
[1:26:18] the very creation that he had made
[1:26:21] it was in this evil thing to keep man
[1:26:23] away but it was the very love of God
[1:26:26] that he knew that I am a clean would
[1:26:28] just God holy
[1:26:31] and I can't commune with filth
[1:26:35] and my whole creation has become filth
[1:26:39] so I've got to make a way
[1:26:42] and he presented a law and he gave a
[1:26:45] dressing and he gave an ordinance and he
[1:26:48] gave away that he could be just in
[1:26:51] communion with his people
[1:26:53] Glory
[1:26:57] why did Jesus stand there with that
[1:27:00] woman at the well when she said not in
[1:27:02] this matter in this mountain we're
[1:27:03] supposed to and over here we're supposed
[1:27:05] to and Jesus said nowhere in any of that
[1:27:08] but God
[1:27:11] seeking the true worship to Worship in
[1:27:15] spirit and in truth
[1:27:18] not in a church
[1:27:20] not under some tradition not under some
[1:27:23] law
[1:27:25] but to worship the true worshiper
[1:27:29] worships
[1:27:30] in the presence of God
[1:27:33] and God only has one place
[1:27:36] for true worship
[1:27:39] and he had to make a way
[1:27:42] when the whole thing was filthy
[1:27:46] he had to make a way
[1:27:49] in all of the world
[1:27:52] and a tent on the backside of the desert
[1:27:55] he made a way
[1:27:58] he laid out a list of commands he chose
[1:28:01] a person he chose a people he chose a
[1:28:05] tribe he chose an order he chose a blood
[1:28:09] he chose a he chose a place a place of
[1:28:13] perpetuation he chose a mercy seat he
[1:28:16] chose everything that he could make way
[1:28:20] together
[1:28:22] that he could bring Fellowship back
[1:28:27] it was all in Shadow of time
[1:28:32] until
[1:28:35] when
[1:28:38] a Time
[1:28:41] that all of that
[1:28:43] wouldn't be a tabernacle made with a
[1:28:46] hands
[1:28:47] oh my
[1:28:51] because he was going to come himself
[1:28:54] and make a way
[1:28:56] toward the law would even mention a
[1:28:59] place of this Hebrews would pick it up
[1:29:01] and say where this pie priest would not
[1:29:03] offer an offering he wouldn't bring in
[1:29:05] two Lambs or two Bullocks one for him
[1:29:08] and one for the congregation because he
[1:29:11] was offering himself
[1:29:13] he was Harvard in himself
[1:29:16] that he would be the once and for all
[1:29:21] oh my God
[1:29:23] Paul would pick it up in Hebrews over
[1:29:25] there in the in the ninth chapter and
[1:29:27] he'd pick up the emergency scene he said
[1:29:28] not in any particulars not in detail he
[1:29:31] brings it up
[1:29:32] but he begins to talk and he begins to
[1:29:34] express and show and he talks to the
[1:29:36] high priest
[1:29:37] and then a high priest was the entrance
[1:29:39] and by that high priest he would come
[1:29:41] and he would walk out and he would tell
[1:29:43] everyone and they would watch as he
[1:29:45] would walk in and go and do the service
[1:29:47] and he'd and he they would listen for
[1:29:49] that Holy Holy Holy they'd wants and
[1:29:51] they'd see the things taking place from
[1:29:53] the outside but they never saw what was
[1:29:55] going on never and so they would sit
[1:29:58] there see there was tribe their Levi and
[1:30:01] them they were the only ones that would
[1:30:02] go in and touch anything and wrap it all
[1:30:04] up and put it away and establish and
[1:30:06] pick it up and move it forward nobody
[1:30:08] outside got to see that
[1:30:11] and only the high priest got to stand
[1:30:13] under the Shekinah Glory
[1:30:20] and here here he was
[1:30:22] and as he was standing there that
[1:30:24] Republican was crying out to see this
[1:30:27] not just to hear about it
[1:30:30] to see it
[1:30:31] I just hear about it but to see it
[1:30:35] amen I'd be merciful show me mercy show
[1:30:37] me your place of Mercy
[1:30:40] show me that place of Mercy show me
[1:30:44] and look number seven in verse 89 and
[1:30:46] when Moses had was gone into the
[1:30:48] Tabernacle of the congregation to speak
[1:30:50] with him
[1:30:51] then he heard the voice of one Speaking
[1:30:54] unto him from all for the mercy seat
[1:30:56] that was upon the Ark of the test of
[1:30:59] testimony from between the two cherubims
[1:31:01] and he spake unto him
[1:31:04] all right so now he's speaking and he's
[1:31:06] deliberate and he's telling us telling
[1:31:08] each and every one by the mouth of Moses
[1:31:11] and he goes out and he expresses but
[1:31:12] listen the heart of the believer
[1:31:14] is not satisfied
[1:31:17] it's not satisfied
[1:31:19] we're just hearing something
[1:31:22] no they're not satisfying
[1:31:26] but they need Mercy
[1:31:29] because Mercy changes everything Mercy
[1:31:32] is the release of the pressure and the
[1:31:34] least of the burden Jesus was coming and
[1:31:36] say take my yoke upon you for my burden
[1:31:39] is light
[1:31:41] this was the word of God the mercies
[1:31:43] he's standing there showing this is the
[1:31:45] place of Mercy this is the release of
[1:31:48] the pressure and the burden of this life
[1:31:51] this is the mercy
[1:31:53] when we cry Lord have to be merciful be
[1:31:55] mercy God we're about to be in the car
[1:31:57] wrecking Mercy Lord
[1:31:59] Mercy but see we say it in vain so often
[1:32:03] but the Publican was crying out mercy
[1:32:06] God show me show me this place of mercy
[1:32:09] and here Moses he was there and and job
[1:32:12] discovered and looked upon it but but we
[1:32:14] look and we see that that revelation of
[1:32:16] what God had come that when that place
[1:32:18] of Mercy
[1:32:19] or when that Grace that election had
[1:32:23] revealed Mercy I want to look because
[1:32:26] Paul would talk about it over in Hebrews
[1:32:27] and he'd go through it and we don't have
[1:32:29] time here this evening but look I want
[1:32:31] to I want to go on jump on over
[1:32:34] in the Book of Revelations because we we
[1:32:37] know that there is the place
[1:32:40] of the mercy in this hour
[1:32:42] amen
[1:32:44] because it's that Mercy
[1:32:48] in the book of Hebrews he'd talk about
[1:32:49] that high priest
[1:32:51] you know they didn't have to offer one
[1:32:53] for self because he was an offering
[1:32:55] continually right there he was that that
[1:32:57] high priest
[1:32:59] and he'd go and he'd Express
[1:33:02] Mercy
[1:33:04] he would be tempted and come and and be
[1:33:06] as we are so that he could he could
[1:33:08] provide true Mercy
[1:33:10] that he would come and make a way that
[1:33:12] that this could be delivered
[1:33:16] unto his children
[1:33:18] amen Grace when when would Grace come
[1:33:22] when did when did Grace give the the
[1:33:24] revelation of Mercy he gave it over
[1:33:26] there in in the book in the four gospels
[1:33:28] he gave it over there at the day of
[1:33:30] Pentecost he gave it through the
[1:33:32] scriptures of Hebrews he's given it all
[1:33:34] down we've had men have picked it up
[1:33:36] through the church ages and talked about
[1:33:37] it and then tried to explain it and and
[1:33:40] tell about it
[1:33:44] but it takes a revelation
[1:33:47] to really know this Mercy
[1:33:50] why would the prophet in himself he
[1:33:52] would say that I would push a quarter
[1:33:53] down the street if that would get you
[1:33:55] healed with my nose
[1:33:58] that's the burden in a man that knows
[1:34:00] this Mercy
[1:34:02] but it's
[1:34:03] but is has a weakness that he can't
[1:34:06] provide it
[1:34:08] you know what that's called it's called
[1:34:09] an infirmity
[1:34:12] it's called in infirmity
[1:34:15] and we are we have a high priest that
[1:34:18] can be touched
[1:34:20] by the feeling of our infirmities
[1:34:23] because why did he become
[1:34:26] flesh
[1:34:27] so they can suffer like we suffer so
[1:34:30] that he would sit over there he said so
[1:34:32] he could secure or he could bring help
[1:34:34] in the time of need
[1:34:37] Paul would look and he'd say salt the
[1:34:39] Lord three times gone to deliver me of
[1:34:42] this
[1:34:43] this infirmity that that buffets me
[1:34:46] continually
[1:34:48] he'll talk about that infirmity that
[1:34:50] would grip him so that God if you would
[1:34:52] just deliver me of this thing but God
[1:34:54] would would deliver back a truth to him
[1:34:57] and he'd say hold on Paul but my Grace
[1:35:03] is sufficient
[1:35:04] [Music]
[1:35:10] my grace is sufficient
[1:35:14] see what was he showing Paul he was
[1:35:17] showing Paul it's not the infermin to
[1:35:19] everybody's got him
[1:35:21] but it's my grace
[1:35:24] that is sufficient that my strength is
[1:35:27] made perfect in your weakness
[1:35:30] what is the desire of the True Believer
[1:35:32] it is that perfect faith it is a perfect
[1:35:36] love it is where Jesus said be thou
[1:35:39] perfect as your father in Heaven is
[1:35:42] perfect he'd have never said that if he
[1:35:44] didn't have a way
[1:35:46] he'd never give us that
[1:35:49] but when we mess up we say Mercy
[1:35:52] when we come short we say Mercy when we
[1:35:56] see somebody struggling that we can't
[1:35:57] help we cry Mercy
[1:36:01] now why because that is the infirmity of
[1:36:04] the weakness of the human being that I
[1:36:06] cannot help another
[1:36:09] for I need help myself
[1:36:13] man can't help man but God is the only
[1:36:16] one
[1:36:17] but through the through the Avenue of of
[1:36:21] Revelation
[1:36:23] that is delivered
[1:36:25] [Music]
[1:36:28] oh it's carried in these Earthen vessels
[1:36:30] though where's that hidden it's hidden
[1:36:34] in these Earthen vessels
[1:36:38] the Earth and vessel can't help you
[1:36:48] but under the revelation
[1:36:51] of who is this Melchizedek
[1:36:54] [Applause]
[1:36:55] the high priest
[1:36:57] he begins to show us
[1:37:00] that there's something in the believer
[1:37:03] he said he said there he said what by
[1:37:05] the foolishness of preaching
[1:37:08] he chose
[1:37:11] I love when he I love it when he chooses
[1:37:13] something because this is the god that
[1:37:16] cannot lie a God that does not make
[1:37:17] mistakes but he chose by the fullness of
[1:37:20] preaching
[1:37:22] to do what to save
[1:37:24] them
[1:37:27] which believe
[1:37:29] they never said he'd save the unbeliever
[1:37:31] but he had saved them which believed
[1:37:34] see we think oh everybody out there but
[1:37:36] then we believe those are the chosen
[1:37:38] elected of God they are the ones that
[1:37:41] believe
[1:37:43] they believe when nothing else will
[1:37:46] because there's something in them
[1:37:49] there's a desire in them why
[1:37:55] I remember walking into a restaurant one
[1:37:57] time this this stands with me
[1:38:00] I walked into a restaurant one time and
[1:38:02] there was a lady standing there Sunday
[1:38:03] afternoon I'd I believe
[1:38:05] at a place and
[1:38:08] and I looked at her she had her earrings
[1:38:09] and she had her her makeup she had her
[1:38:12] you know her bobbed hair and she had her
[1:38:15] worldly attire on and and as I was
[1:38:18] looking I'm thinking
[1:38:20] what is it
[1:38:22] and people don't desire anymore
[1:38:25] and at that point I realized that's all
[1:38:28] that they desire
[1:38:30] They Don't Really desire Mercy
[1:38:34] they desire the ability to do something
[1:38:38] and to hopefully be good enough to one
[1:38:40] day make it into heaven
[1:38:43] because everybody wants to go to heaven
[1:38:47] who wouldn't
[1:38:49] who wouldn't
[1:38:51] that's that's recognizing a story of
[1:38:54] streets of gold
[1:38:56] it's recognizing hearing stories about a
[1:38:59] wonderful place who wouldn't want to go
[1:39:00] there brother Steve
[1:39:02] but what makes somebody
[1:39:05] that could serve this God and be in
[1:39:08] communion with this God
[1:39:11] and so desire a closer walk and a
[1:39:14] revelation
[1:39:16] that he would stand there and say that
[1:39:18] if God if I get there on that day and he
[1:39:21] kicks me into hell
[1:39:22] I'll still love him
[1:39:25] there was there was something to desire
[1:39:27] in him that would stand there and say
[1:39:29] that if he desired me to be Antichrist
[1:39:32] that's what I would want to be
[1:39:35] see it's aligning with the revelation
[1:39:39] so Desiring
[1:39:43] of Mercy
[1:39:45] show me God
[1:39:47] watch Revelations I want to get over the
[1:39:49] revelations it's it's it's it's it's
[1:39:51] common understanding in the around the
[1:39:54] message forgive me for my weak eyes
[1:39:57] but once you're in Revelations we know
[1:39:59] that we know in Revelation the fourth
[1:40:01] chapter we know the the the the the
[1:40:03] church ages are are over
[1:40:07] chapter 4 we know that this is the the
[1:40:09] calling up that John would look in verse
[1:40:12] one after this I looked
[1:40:14] and behold a door was opened in heaven
[1:40:18] and the first voice which I heard was as
[1:40:21] it were of a trumpet talking with me
[1:40:22] which said come up hither
[1:40:25] and I will show thee things which must
[1:40:29] be hereafter
[1:40:30] and immediately I was in the spirit and
[1:40:32] behold a throne was set in heaven and
[1:40:36] one sat on the throne now here John is
[1:40:40] gathering a revelation like he's never
[1:40:42] had and he that said was to look upon he
[1:40:45] begins to talk about the throne and the
[1:40:47] elders and he comes down to his Express
[1:40:49] and he sees all of heaven and he's
[1:40:51] beginning to see things now that he's
[1:40:53] never seen before he's heard of these
[1:40:55] things he's watching and he's come up
[1:40:57] hither to another place
[1:40:59] amen
[1:41:00] amen but if you notice there
[1:41:04] and after this
[1:41:07] I looked
[1:41:09] when when is the time
[1:41:13] when is a Time
[1:41:16] when after this
[1:41:20] after this John recognized
[1:41:25] another voice was calling for it not
[1:41:28] another but the same boys was calling
[1:41:30] him to something else to show him and
[1:41:33] then we know that we're going down into
[1:41:34] verse 5 and we see there and I saw in
[1:41:36] the right hand of him that sat on the
[1:41:38] throne of book written within and on the
[1:41:40] backside sealed with Seven Seals
[1:41:44] after this is when he saw this
[1:41:48] after this and I saw a strong angel
[1:41:50] proclaiming with a loud voice he's
[1:41:53] asking the question who is Worthy
[1:41:57] who is Worthy
[1:41:59] to open the book and to loose the seals
[1:42:01] thereof
[1:42:03] and the response of John and I wept
[1:42:07] while no man in Heaven Nor nerve neither
[1:42:10] under the Earth was able to open the
[1:42:12] book neither to look thereon
[1:42:18] and I John wept
[1:42:21] wept
[1:42:23] wet of infirmity
[1:42:28] who can be touched by the feeling of our
[1:42:30] infirmities
[1:42:32] but here John is is weeping under the
[1:42:35] bird and
[1:42:36] who's Worthy
[1:42:38] and he we know that he he looked all
[1:42:40] over Heaven he looked all over Earth he
[1:42:42] looked he he he he would say he shot
[1:42:45] instruments Down Under the Earth he he
[1:42:47] he sent messages all through Heaven he
[1:42:50] got on if it was present day he'd got on
[1:42:52] he'd got on social media and he asked
[1:42:54] and he looked and he'd find and he'd
[1:42:56] seek and he'd find where who is worthy
[1:42:59] to take me and show me mercy
[1:43:04] who can give me the revelation of this
[1:43:07] Mercy that I'm looking for
[1:43:09] why John was under a burden
[1:43:13] he was under a burden
[1:43:15] he was under a burden a time for the
[1:43:17] bride here in this hour he's under a
[1:43:18] bird and he was looking he was looking
[1:43:19] he was looking
[1:43:21] he was looking he had heard he'd heard
[1:43:22] he'd heard he'd gone through all the
[1:43:24] churches he'd studied all the Traditions
[1:43:25] he'd read all the books of all the
[1:43:27] preachers he had studied all the schools
[1:43:29] of theology he'd gone this way and he'd
[1:43:31] gone that way but he come to something
[1:43:33] and that that when he stood there and he
[1:43:35] said there's something more
[1:43:38] [Music]
[1:43:41] something more than just going to church
[1:43:43] there's something more than just living
[1:43:45] a good life there's something more
[1:43:49] because they don't satisfy me
[1:43:54] because there's something deeper
[1:43:56] there's something crying out on the
[1:43:58] inside
[1:44:01] and look
[1:44:02] he said those are none's worthy what
[1:44:05] were they looking for somebody worthy
[1:44:06] not somebody that was that had that had
[1:44:09] done good
[1:44:11] man that would one of these study that
[1:44:13] we look it out it's the one that is
[1:44:15] elected for a position
[1:44:18] [Music]
[1:44:20] looking for
[1:44:21] that was elected where were they elected
[1:44:27] before the foundation
[1:44:32] so John had
[1:44:34] he he's where'd he search he searched
[1:44:37] all through Heaven All Through Time he
[1:44:38] searched everywhere
[1:44:41] and he's looking and he's looking and he
[1:44:43] wept but then all of a sudden the voice
[1:44:45] comes to him don't weep John
[1:44:47] we found one
[1:44:54] what book is he in
[1:44:58] what tape is he on
[1:45:02] what church does he show up at
[1:45:06] what preacher does he hang out with
[1:45:09] where is he
[1:45:11] he said behold the lion of the tribe of
[1:45:14] Judah
[1:45:15] he hath prevailed
[1:45:18] what did he Prevail to do he was one
[1:45:21] Worthy
[1:45:25] and John turned around to look
[1:45:27] he'd heard about it he he had been there
[1:45:31] with it
[1:45:34] he had been standing there looking at
[1:45:38] he'd watched it in real life
[1:45:43] come on Saints
[1:45:46] he said we were Witnesses
[1:45:48] [Applause]
[1:45:50] first John he gave witness of it little
[1:45:54] children
[1:45:57] he stood there with Peter and James and
[1:46:00] they witnessed with their eyes
[1:46:04] but over here he couldn't find out who
[1:46:06] was Worthy
[1:46:09] takes a greater Revelation why Paul
[1:46:11] would say no man Nothing by the flesh
[1:46:17] now you know the frustration when you're
[1:46:20] trying to witness to somebody and tell
[1:46:21] them the hope that lies within you
[1:46:24] you can't tell them
[1:46:26] but he's got to give it to him
[1:46:30] John was looking for one worthy he knew
[1:46:32] there was one that died on the cross he
[1:46:35] knew that there was a prize that had
[1:46:36] been paid but who was going to be worthy
[1:46:39] to take the book
[1:46:43] what was it about that book
[1:46:47] what was it about that book
[1:46:51] he looked and he looked he said behold
[1:46:52] and John turned around and there he saw
[1:46:54] the very thing he saw the bloody Lambs
[1:46:57] standing there
[1:46:58] the bloody lamb watch what he said there
[1:47:01] but in the breach between the Sea of the
[1:47:03] church ages and the seals John looked at
[1:47:06] that lamp
[1:47:07] and that lamb looked like he had been
[1:47:09] slain
[1:47:11] and then he noticed he was wounded and
[1:47:14] cut and bruised and bleeding
[1:47:18] oh my a bloody lamb that's what took
[1:47:22] our place
[1:47:25] that's what took our place
[1:47:27] is an exchange of simple lamb had to
[1:47:29] take our place
[1:47:31] and he saw the lamb he proceeded out
[1:47:35] talking about the lamb the lamb
[1:47:36] proceeded out
[1:47:38] because listen John it doesn't looked
[1:47:40] everywhere
[1:47:41] John hadn't saw him
[1:47:44] because he had been way back into the
[1:47:47] eternities
[1:47:51] Glory
[1:47:52] when
[1:47:55] when has this come to pass
[1:47:58] watch now and brother Adam says there
[1:48:00] where was he he was back there into the
[1:48:02] eternities even making intercession
[1:48:05] and showing that those who had come to
[1:48:09] God under the offering of the blood of
[1:48:10] bulls and of goats of substitutionary
[1:48:13] offering
[1:48:14] because them who believed it pointed to
[1:48:17] him
[1:48:18] for every offering that was offered in
[1:48:20] forever for every burnt offering that
[1:48:22] was given for every blood that was
[1:48:24] sprinkled every lamb that was
[1:48:25] slaughtered every single one they all
[1:48:28] sat there when the True Believers when
[1:48:30] they offered it and and their conscience
[1:48:32] was was was was was just washed over for
[1:48:35] another year and they would sit there
[1:48:37] and they were doing what they were
[1:48:38] pointing to one to come
[1:48:39] not seeing him
[1:48:42] but knowing about it
[1:48:46] about him my brother Brandon said what
[1:48:47] she said now look because them who
[1:48:48] believed it pointed to him and the blood
[1:48:50] had not been shed yet as back there so
[1:48:53] he was there to clear them
[1:48:57] he was there to clear them
[1:48:59] he was there to clear you
[1:49:03] and I
[1:49:05] I
[1:49:06] know God I hope he's here tonight for
[1:49:08] every sinner of the Lamb been slain how
[1:49:10] can Jehovah see anything but that Bloody
[1:49:13] lamb standing there
[1:49:15] that's all that he sees
[1:49:19] and the lamb proceeded out watch
[1:49:22] and the lamb proceeded out
[1:49:25] into the vision now
[1:49:29] where'd he come to
[1:49:31] where'd that Bloody lamb appear out of
[1:49:33] Eternity to he come from all eternity
[1:49:35] and where did he come he come here
[1:49:38] brother Brian said he'd come out of that
[1:49:39] Vision John was watching what was John
[1:49:41] watch he was watching a vision but the
[1:49:43] Visions got to speak
[1:49:45] the vision has to come manifest the
[1:49:48] vision cannot stay a vision it's got to
[1:49:51] become reality
[1:49:52] John was the type of that bread
[1:49:55] that bread has got to recognize
[1:49:59] she's not recognizing a church she's not
[1:50:02] recognizing a tradition she is
[1:50:05] recognizing that Bloody lamb that is
[1:50:08] steadforth out of Eternity
[1:50:11] she knows
[1:50:13] it wasn't an altar
[1:50:16] that she got saved at
[1:50:19] the bride knows
[1:50:21] it wasn't some night
[1:50:23] she got saved
[1:50:25] she knows
[1:50:28] hey a minute want some Sensation that
[1:50:30] saved her
[1:50:32] she knows it wasn't some work they put
[1:50:35] her there
[1:50:37] but now she's understanding
[1:50:41] she's getting revelation
[1:50:44] she's getting revelation
[1:50:47] of a bloody lamb she's getting a
[1:50:50] revelation what is it something is
[1:50:52] coming to her something is expressing
[1:50:54] through this message when he said them
[1:50:56] divinely revealed mystery truths would
[1:50:59] literally
[1:51:00] turn her heart

[2:02:57] I hope you understand the language of
[2:02:59] God
[2:03:01] Romans chapter 9.
[2:03:04] if you dare you can say Amen verse 11
[2:03:07] the Bible say for the children
[2:03:11] being not yet born
[2:03:14] so does he have anything to do with your
[2:03:16] birth
[2:03:18] so take your birth out
[2:03:20] come on neither
[2:03:23] having done any good or water
[2:03:28] if they would have said any good and
[2:03:30] stop there somebody would have said
[2:03:32] something
[2:03:33] the Lord said not only good good or evil
[2:03:38] some did things good some are evil
[2:03:41] so does he have to do with what you did
[2:03:45] it's difficult for human being to accept
[2:03:48] this
[2:03:50] amen Kama that the purpose of God not
[2:03:56] your purpose
[2:03:57] but the purpose of God according to
[2:04:01] election must end so God won't establish
[2:04:05] his election
[2:04:06] and that election have nothing to do
[2:04:09] with your birth or nothing to do with
[2:04:11] what you have done it is all about God's
[2:04:15] sovereignty amen what he says and what
[2:04:17] he picked that's what gonna matter
[2:04:20] Amen in other words you can be 100 good
[2:04:28] it doesn't matter
[2:04:29] and somebody might be 100 bad what
[2:04:33] matter is what did God say about you
[2:04:38] do you hear me what God says
[2:04:44] I don't have time
[2:04:46] everybody okay
[2:04:47] in other words if God say yes
[2:04:52] amen if then if they find you in evil
[2:04:56] yes we'll take evil and change that evil
[2:05:01] to make the yes of God stand
[2:05:05] do you understand what I'm saying I wish
[2:05:08] I have time
[2:05:09] I would have set some people free
[2:05:13] by the preaching of the word
[2:05:16] do you hear what I'm saying
[2:05:19] usually the way human being operate
[2:05:28] this is God
[2:05:30] and this is you
[2:05:33] amen
[2:05:35] and you want to be good
[2:05:38] amen so you can tell God
[2:05:41] that you deserve it
[2:05:44] amen what Paul is saying is this one
[2:05:49] doesn't matter to God
[2:05:53] everybody okay this one have nothing to
[2:05:57] do with God what matters to God is what
[2:06:00] he spoke
[2:06:03] do you understand it is what God
[2:06:06] determined
[2:06:08] in other words it is God's own personal
[2:06:12] decision
[2:06:14] thank you
[2:06:16] everybody okay amen if God decided no
[2:06:26] you can make Judah a disciple
[2:06:29] [Music]
[2:06:31] I can make this I don't have time do you
[2:06:34] know who chose Judas
[2:06:36] who chose him
[2:06:38] how can he choose somebody and lose him
[2:06:43] your boss is speaking now but you you
[2:06:45] don't have time
[2:06:47] everybody okay
[2:06:48] everybody okay who chose Judas
[2:06:51] how can Jesus choose something and lose
[2:06:54] him
[2:06:55] because
[2:06:57] the scripture said
[2:07:01] do you hear me the scripture says that
[2:07:05] accept the son of perdition
[2:07:10] everybody here so no matter how much
[2:07:12] good how good Judah will do things
[2:07:17] Jesus will be forced
[2:07:20] to lose Judah
[2:07:25] remember Judas came and returned the
[2:07:28] money
[2:07:31] do you understand what I'm saying Judas
[2:07:34] returned the money but even the
[2:07:37] returning of the money which look good
[2:07:40] cannot make Judah back again he cannot
[2:07:44] restore Judah back
[2:07:46] because the decision for Judah was no
[2:07:50] do you understand what I'm saying but
[2:07:52] Peter
[2:07:57] deny Jesus how many times
[2:08:01] with a three Witness
[2:08:03] everybody okay he even cast
[2:08:08] everybody okay but Peter's decision was
[2:08:11] yes
[2:08:15] do you follow me so when Jesus looked at
[2:08:19] Peter about to go to Temptation he goes
[2:08:22] quickly he begin to pray for Peter he
[2:08:24] said Lord not Peter not Peter not Peter
[2:08:26] not Peter not Peter
[2:08:30] why didn't Jesus pray for Judah
[2:08:34] he said Peter I pray for you why he
[2:08:38] didn't pray for Judah
[2:08:40] why he didn't pray for Judas only Peter
[2:08:44] because the decision the election say
[2:08:47] Peter is right here
[2:08:50] anybody here so when he goes down to
[2:08:53] Hell when he comes back up the first
[2:08:56] person is
[2:08:57] who was struggling he was feeding God
[2:09:00] tell Peter
[2:09:07] do you see the message of the hour you
[2:09:10] see the message of the hour can I read
[2:09:12] or you good you already got it
[2:09:15] can I read
[2:09:16] you sure
[2:09:19] verse 11 he says that election must
[2:09:22] stand not of what
[2:09:27] are you reading not of works but of him
[2:09:30] that do what
[2:09:32] so it doesn't matter what you want to
[2:09:35] work or how much you want to do stuff
[2:09:39] verse verse 12. he will say the unto her
[2:09:43] the Elder Shall Serve the
[2:09:47] when
[2:09:49] before they were even born
[2:09:52] amen so what can you do to help Esau
[2:09:58] if you understand these things you will
[2:10:01] take your hand off your life
[2:10:04] and you will stop having high blood
[2:10:06] pressure
[2:10:10] amen
[2:10:12] verse 13 as it is written Jacob Heather
[2:10:16] but he so ever
[2:10:18] what shall we say then
[2:10:21] is there unrighteousness with God
[2:10:25] humanly speaking you will say that's
[2:10:27] partiality
[2:10:30] the Bible say God forbid in other words
[2:10:32] the harsh
[2:10:33] you can't say that everybody okay
[2:10:37] verse 15 for he said to Moses I will
[2:10:41] have
[2:10:45] on whom I will have
[2:10:48] and I will have
[2:10:50] compassion on whom I will have
[2:10:53] so then it is not of him that
[2:10:57] nor of him
[2:10:59] but of God that showeth water
[2:11:02] what can you do
[2:11:03] [Music]
[2:11:08] amen what can you do jump now to verse
[2:11:12] 22 so you're going to see who is Mercy
[2:11:15] what if God willing to show his water
[2:11:19] he's wrath and to make his power known
[2:11:23] endureth with much long suffering the
[2:11:27] vessels of what
[2:11:29] fit into water in other words this
[2:11:32] vessel is a human being you know vessels
[2:11:34] we already talked about it's a human
[2:11:36] being so there is somebody that is
[2:11:38] prepared but he's programmed for rough
[2:11:44] am I reading a different Bible
[2:11:46] the Bible say he was a vessel of Wrath
[2:11:49] which was faded
[2:11:52] for Destruction so they made him to
[2:11:55] destroy him
[2:11:57] everybody okay
[2:11:59] everybody okay
[2:12:01] okay that's the vessels of Wrath and
[2:12:04] verse 23 that he might make known the
[2:12:08] water
[2:12:09] The Witches of his
[2:12:12] on the vessels of water
[2:12:18] so why Mercy come to you
[2:12:21] because you are
[2:12:23] because you are a vessel of Mercy
[2:12:27] just the way you are you are the vessel
[2:12:31] of Mercy
[2:12:40] in other words if you are not a vessel
[2:12:43] of Mercy you will not have mercy
[2:12:51] Mercy The Vessel of Mercy which he had
[2:12:56] what
[2:12:58] do you know what a four means a four
[2:13:01] prepare unto what
[2:13:03] so a vessel of Mercy is a vessel that
[2:13:07] was prepared Before Time for Glory
[2:13:11] so
[2:13:12] do you need to manufacture Your Glory
[2:13:15] there is something in you that will
[2:13:18] produce Glory
[2:13:22] if you learn to just obey God
[2:13:26] that's why I told you if you're doing
[2:13:28] something wrong take it remove it
[2:13:32] that's all you have to do and that's it
[2:13:34] amen
[2:13:36] Jesus Christ he said verse 24 even as
[2:13:40] whom he has called not of the Jews on me
[2:13:43] but also of the water of the Gentile and
[2:13:47] he said also in Hosea
[2:13:49] I will call them my people which were
[2:13:52] not my people and her beloved it's a
[2:13:56] woman
[2:13:57] so Mercy is a woman
[2:14:00] I'm gonna call that woman her beloved
[2:14:02] which was not what
[2:14:04] because we were Gentile
[2:14:06] but he's going to take a Brad from The
[2:14:09] Gentile amen and he shall come to pass
[2:14:12] when that happened that in the place
[2:14:14] where he would say unto them which is a
[2:14:17] people in the brand ye are not my people
[2:14:19] because we were not Jews they shall they
[2:14:23] there shall they call the children of
[2:14:28] the living
[2:14:30] what else can you do
[2:14:34] amen what else can you do I could have
[2:14:38] tell you more than this
[2:14:40] but I'm gonna stop because you're
[2:14:42] already tired you need to go home
[2:14:45] I know I know what I'm trying to say but
[2:14:48] it will set somebody free
[2:14:51] amen maybe Lord willing one day you will
[2:14:54] understand that amen if you understand
[2:14:57] the power of this thing
[2:15:00] I'm gonna say it in in in in
[2:15:03] a very close sentence
[2:15:06] so you understand the Publican prayed
[2:15:11] when he finished praying that he has a
