[0:17] Brother, why am I going to withhold you
[0:19] for something that is good?
[0:21] &gt;&gt; Right.
[0:21] &gt;&gt; I will preach it to you.
[0:23] &gt;&gt; I say put faith to work.
[0:24] &gt;&gt; Ask God forbid things, but when it's
[0:27] wrong, let also come back and say that
[0:28] is not.
[0:29] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[0:32] WE ARE NOT HERE TO PLEASE THE
[0:34] CONGREGATION
[0:35] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE WE ARE AFRAID IF WE PREACH
[0:37] AGAINST CHRISTMAS we will lose half of
[0:39] the congregation.
[0:43] &gt;&gt; WE GOT PRESSURE FROM OUR FAMILY MEMBER.
[0:46] THEY WANT TO do Christmas tree. So the
[0:48] pastor is silence.
[0:50] &gt;&gt; He's avoiding to touch it BECAUSE HE
[0:52] WILL TOUCH HIS OWN FAMILY member
[0:55] &gt;&gt; in Christmas.
[0:58] Amen.
[1:00] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02] &gt;&gt; That's not the case, my friend.
[1:04] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. If you call a pastor, make sure
[1:07] God call you.
[1:08] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:08] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE A PASTOR MUST speak the truth.
[1:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13] &gt;&gt; REGARDLESS OF THE PERSON,
[1:16] &gt;&gt; A PASTOR MUST SPEAK THE TRUTH REGARDLESS
[1:19] OF WHO IT IS.
[1:20] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:23] &gt;&gt; OR WE HERE FOR PAYCHECK.
[1:25] &gt;&gt; NO.
[1:26] &gt;&gt; WE HERE FOR MONEY OF STUDY. NO.
[1:29] &gt;&gt; AND PEOPLE SOUL ARE DYING.
[1:34] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER?
[1:35] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:35] &gt;&gt; THEY CALL ME SOMEWHERE. I WENT
[1:37] SOMEWHERE. I SAT. THEY PUT A CHRISTMAS
[1:39] TREE.
[1:40] &gt;&gt; I say I'm sorry. I'm going to go to
[1:42] another corner.
[1:43] &gt;&gt; I don't even want to sit beside that
[1:45] Christmas tree.
[1:46] &gt;&gt; Because I don't want people to TAKE A
[1:47] PICTURE AND SAY, "HEY, I SAY LET me stay
[1:50] away the Christmas tree.
[1:52] &gt;&gt; I KNOW THE DEVIL. I KNOW THE DEVIL."
[1:54] &gt;&gt; RIGHT?
[1:56] I know the devil.
[1:59] &gt;&gt; I know the devil.
[2:04] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER?
[2:06] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER?
[2:08] &gt;&gt; This is the only sermon you're getting
[2:09] today.
[2:11] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:12] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:12] &gt;&gt; CAN WE CONTINUE? THAT IS AN OASIS FOR
[2:15] WHAT?
[2:16] &gt;&gt; DEVIL'S A DEVIL'S EXCUSE.
[2:17] &gt;&gt; YOU WANT TO GIVE SOMETHING, IT IS
[2:19] &gt;&gt; YOUR life to Christ. Amen.
[2:21] &gt;&gt; Give what?
[2:22] &gt;&gt; Your life TO CHRIST. DON'T GIVE TO ONE
[2:25] ANOTHER.
[2:26] &gt;&gt; UHHUH. RIGHT.
[2:28] &gt;&gt; RIGHT.
[2:29] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:32] &gt;&gt; MY BROTHER PREACHER, MY BROTHER PASTOR.
[2:35] &gt;&gt; UHHUH.
[2:36] &gt;&gt; SIT DOWN AND CONSIDER
[2:38] &gt;&gt; YOU ARE MAKING CONFUSION IN the church
[2:41] &gt;&gt; and confusion all over the world
[2:44] &gt;&gt; because of trying to please people
[2:46] &gt;&gt; because of trying to hold people in the
[2:48] church.
[2:56] We got so much mess in this message.
[3:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:01] &gt;&gt; Church become families.
[3:05] &gt;&gt; Church become racial issue.
[3:11] &gt;&gt; The pastor is a black man.
[3:13] &gt;&gt; So let's take our children there. So our
[3:16] children will go under a black
[3:18] environment.
[3:19] Nonsense.
[3:23] &gt;&gt; THE PASTOR IS A JAPANESE.
[3:25] &gt;&gt; Let's take our children there so they
[3:27] can go in an environment of Japanese.
[3:29] The pastor is an African.
[3:32] &gt;&gt; Let's go to AN AFRICAN CHURCH. LISTEN,
[3:34] DON'T COME HERE BECAUSE I'M an African.
[3:36] &gt;&gt; Right.
[3:40] &gt;&gt; PUT ME ON TIK TOK.
[3:42] &gt;&gt; DON'T COME IN THIS CHURCH BECAUSE I'M AN
[3:44] AFRICAN.
[3:45] &gt;&gt; COME HERE BECAUSE OF THE WORD.

[4:14] CAUCASIAN CHURCH. MY CHILDREN ARE BLACK.

[4:27] GOES TO THIS CHURCH. EVERYBODY FROM THIS
[4:29] TRIBE GO TO REST YOUR SPIRIT.
[4:32] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHAT IT IS.
[4:33] &gt;&gt; UH-HUH.
[4:34] &gt;&gt; LET'S COME BACK TO THE WORD.
[4:35] &gt;&gt; RIGHT.
[4:37] &gt;&gt; RIGHT.

[4:40] KINGDOM.
[4:41] &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT.
