[38:49] and i usually want to stick with my
[38:51] church
[38:52] and be there amen i was supposed to be
[38:55] maybe somewhere
[38:56] but i'm here this morning amen so i
[38:59] understand
[39:00] when a pastor an established one
[39:03] for a long time can leave the church and

[39:13] thanks to you

[39:28] and you're going to have sunday schools
[39:31] and everything else so you got to get
[39:33] used to it a little bit amen
[39:36] you got used to one service one service
[39:38] without sunday school
[39:39] once we get in the building sunday
[39:41] school is included
[39:43] amen because now we have the place to do
[39:46] it
[39:46] so brother chadland will take his
[39:49] liberty
[39:50] brother chad this is not a new church
[39:53] this is home for you amen if you don't
[39:57] have a place to go somewhere
[39:58] just remember there is home in north
[40:01] carolina for you
[40:02] amen always if you don't have anywhere
[40:05] just remember there is home here so you
[40:07] preach like homer
[40:09] there is a boat there you thought your
[40:11] pastor is a teacher you
[40:13] wait
[40:13] [Laughter]
[40:16] amen amen
[40:20] you're gonna hear a true anointed
[40:23] teacher
[40:24] by the grace of god all the glory goes
[40:27] to jesus
[40:28] but we want to acknowledge one another
[40:30] amen
[40:31] brother branham say you don't wait till
[40:33] somebody's passed away
[40:35] before you cast your flower you give it
[40:36] to him when he's alive amen
[40:39] amen hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[40:43] and he's one of the special one because
[40:46] he went exactly through what we went
[40:49] every experience we went through he went
[40:52] before it
[40:53] and trust me he's the one who told me
[40:56] things and it happened exactly the way
[40:59] he wanted me
[41:00] he told me i won't call him a prophet
[41:02] before somebody say i call him a prophet
[41:05] anyway a new testament preacher is a
[41:07] prophet
[41:08] [Laughter]
[41:10] if you need a quote on that one i can
[41:12] give it to you amen
[41:14] yes so he knows what we went through
[41:17] he's here standing with us he understand
[41:20] the pain
[41:21] and the suffering and the lord lets the
[41:23] holy spirit
[41:24] take his liberty and let him preach his
[41:27] heart out
[41:27] just like his home amen pull on the gift
[41:30] of the lord and i believe the god who
[41:32] orchestrate
[41:33] everything and who work everything
[41:36] according to the council
[41:38] of his own will knew that today he's
[41:41] going to be with us
[41:42] let's sing only believe
[41:43] [Music]
[41:46] oh lay

[41:54] only believe
[41:59] all things are
[42:02] possible but each other

[42:12] or not
[42:16] thank you
[42:30] [Music]
[42:42] amen praise the lord thank you musicians
[42:46] i just want to say it's a pleasure to be
[42:48] here with you this morning
[42:50] amen we want to greet you in the name of
[42:52] the lord jesus christ
[42:53] my family and i i was privileged to have
[42:56] my wife travel with me
[42:58] and my children at least four of my five
[43:00] our oldest is married now
[43:02] and he's back home but he couldn't make
[43:04] it
[43:05] but they don't usually travel anywhere
[43:07] with me because most of my travels have
[43:10] been overseas so it's been a blessing to
[43:11] have him here
[43:13] we bring you greetings from the home
[43:14] church as well
[43:16] and just want to say thank you for all
[43:18] your hospitality
[43:20] you've treated us really well you've
[43:21] said some kind things that have really
[43:23] encouraged and blessed us
[43:25] we want to thank brother stephen and his
[43:26] wife sharon for their hospitality and
[43:29] their generosity and their blessings
[43:31] and sister lorell for all the good
[43:33] cooking we've been well fed amen
[43:37] i hope we can give a little back this
[43:38] morning amen
[43:40] for you sure fed us good i also want to
[43:43] say happy father's day to all the
[43:44] fathers
[43:46] amen father's day is a it's just a thing
[43:49] that somebody made up along the way
[43:52] but you know what we have a father
[43:54] [Music]
[43:56] and for that we're all grateful amen and
[43:59] we all have the same father
[44:01] and that's what makes us part of the
[44:02] same family
[44:07] [Music]
[44:11] and so the world can say what they want
[44:13] about father's day and do what they want
[44:14] about father's day
[44:16] but i had a father before the foundation
[44:18] of the world
[44:19] before i had an earthly father i had a
[44:21] heavenly father
[44:24] he will always be my father my maker
[44:28] my husband my lover
[44:31] my all in all amen
[44:36] while we're standing if we could turn to
[44:38] the book of genesis and let's just get
[44:39] right into the word
[44:49] the most difficult part of this for me
[44:53] is saying hello and getting started
[44:57] the easiest part is when we go to the
[44:58] word amen and god starts working
[45:01] so i'm always eager to go to the word
[45:03] amen
[45:04] i see some ministers they're so smooth
[45:07] and they're so comfortable greeting
[45:08] people saying hello and
[45:10] i say oh god i can't do that amen i just
[45:13] want to go to the word that's when i'm
[45:14] comfortable
[45:16] so bear with me god bless you all in
[45:18] genesis chapter 3 verse 6.
[45:21] this morning i'd like to preach on the
[45:23] ministry of the father
[45:26] the ministry of the father genesis
[45:28] chapter 3 verse 6.
[45:32] and the woman saw that the tree was good
[45:34] for food
[45:35] and that it was pleasant to the eyes and
[45:37] a tree to be desired to make one wise
[45:40] and she took of the fruit thereof and
[45:42] did eat and gave also into her husband
[45:43] with her and he did eat
[45:46] and the eyes of them both were open and
[45:47] they knew that they were naked and they
[45:49] sowed
[45:50] fig leaves together and made themselves
[45:52] aprons
[45:53] and they heard the voice of the lord god
[45:55] walking in the garden in the cool of the
[45:57] day and adam and his wife hid themselves
[45:59] from the presence of the lord god
[46:01] amongst the trees of the garden
[46:03] and the lord god called unto adam and
[46:05] said unto him
[46:06] where art thou and he said i heard thy
[46:09] voice
[46:09] in the garden and i was afraid because i
[46:12] was naked and i hid myself
[46:16] let's just bow our heads and ask the
[46:17] lord's blessing over his word
[46:19] dear lord jesus we thank you for this
[46:21] privilege to be here god
[46:24] god may the gathering of the saints
[46:25] never become a tradition
[46:28] may it never become formalized out of
[46:30] and become a habit
[46:31] may it always be precious to us lord
[46:34] something we value something we set
[46:36] aside our time
[46:37] something we arrange our whole week
[46:38] around
[46:40] because lord this is a opportunity we
[46:42] may not always have
[46:44] but while we have it lord let us take
[46:46] advantage of it and come
[46:48] with a fresh desire with a fresh
[46:50] expectation lord
[46:52] coming to this service as as if it were
[46:54] the last lord that we would have
[46:56] may we receive from you all that you
[46:58] have for us today
[47:00] god i pray you take this vessel in your
[47:02] hand and use it as a tool
[47:04] for the ministry of your word may it be
[47:07] you lord who breaks the bread of life
[47:09] and may our eyes come
[47:10] open at the breaking of the bread and
[47:11] may we recognize
[47:13] it was you lord lord i pray that you
[47:16] would take control of the service and
[47:17] have preeminence
[47:19] that you would be pleased with all that
[47:20] we say in all that we do
[47:22] in jesus christ's name we pray amen
[47:26] you can be seated
[47:30] before we we go any further stay in this
[47:32] scripture because we're going to deal
[47:34] with this scripture for just a little
[47:35] while
[47:36] but you know as uh brother stephen was
[47:39] saying
[47:40] that we've went through some similar
[47:42] things your assembly and our assembly
[47:45] and um we understand you know we're
[47:48] we're far enough down the road that we
[47:50] can look back with a different
[47:51] perspective
[47:52] than we had when we were in the middle
[47:53] of our trouble and
[47:55] we're just a few years further down than
[47:57] you may be but
[47:58] god has brought you down the same path
[48:02] and really when when tragedy struck and
[48:05] we have a
[48:06] pastor who we have confidence in and
[48:08] love
[48:09] not didn't hate the man loved him
[48:13] respected him wanted him to be right
[48:16] we wanted him to be right we wanted him
[48:18] to be our brother
[48:20] but when he left the word we had to stay
[48:22] with the word
[48:27] and we didn't realize
[48:30] as we were sitting under that atmosphere
[48:33] of unbelief
[48:35] we didn't realize what it was doing to
[48:37] us
[48:39] we didn't realize the the lethargy that
[48:41] had come in and the apathy and
[48:43] the compromise and it was like the frog
[48:47] and the kettle you know he goes in and
[48:49] the water's comfortable and
[48:50] keeps turning it up and he's he's dying
[48:54] and he doesn't know it
[48:56] he just becomes accustomed to it and
[48:57] gets used to it
[49:00] but god will not let his bride be
[49:03] manhandled
[49:06] this this is not like any other age
[49:13] this age is different than any age
[49:14] that's been before
[49:17] because god prophesied he will present
[49:20] to himself a bride without spot or
[49:22] wrinkle
[49:24] and you realize that bride has no
[49:26] ability to present herself without spot
[49:29] a wrinkle
[49:30] because she's coming to this life in a
[49:32] fallen condition she's come
[49:34] compromised to begin with and in the
[49:37] flesh in our human spirit and in our
[49:39] mind we're prone to compromise
[49:41] we come a perverted way and we're prone
[49:43] to the perversion
[49:45] and in every age it went the same way
[49:47] god brought a fresh word he gathered the
[49:49] elect to that word
[49:50] amen and then fallen spirits begin to
[49:52] come in and begin to pervert the word
[49:55] and bring the church into formalism
[49:57] and move them away from the word and it
[49:59] happened
[50:00] first age second age third age fourth
[50:03] age fifth age
[50:04] six age it even happened in the seventh
[50:06] age to the pentecostal revival
[50:10] but in this age something was going to
[50:12] change
[50:13] to make sure that never happened again
[50:17] and now the bridegroom himself was going
[50:20] to come
[50:21] and the bridegroom is here
[50:24] and the presence of the bridegroom
[50:26] ensures that this bride will not be
[50:29] manhandled like before
[50:31] she will not fall in the same cycle the
[50:33] cycles broken by the presence of the
[50:38] bridegroom
[50:40] amen the prophet of god told us this
[50:43] message will not denominate
[50:47] but it doesn't mean there's not
[50:48] denominational spirits all around the
[50:52] message
[50:54] but the message is christ and you can't
[50:56] denominate christ
[50:57] [Applause]
[50:58] [Music]
[51:01] so so what we realized happened to us
[51:05] is we were eagles in a cage and we
[51:07] didn't know it
[51:09] our wings had been clipped
[51:12] because when you clip away the word you
[51:15] clip away our power
[51:18] because what was the power that lifts
[51:20] the eagles two great wings
[51:22] the new and the old testament the word
[51:24] of god and we will fly on the word of
[51:26] god amen
[51:28] and as you trim the word you start
[51:31] trimming the power to fly
[51:34] and our and as the word was trimmed here
[51:37] we didn't notice it at first and then
[51:39] another trimming and we did
[51:40] and before we realized that we were back
[51:42] on the post in the barnyard
[51:46] and we thought we were okay because we
[51:48] were still higher than the chickens
[51:55] but we're not supposed to be on the post
[51:57] in the barnyard just a little higher
[51:59] than the chickens
[52:00] we're supposed to be in the heavenlies
[52:02] above the clouds
[52:03] above the storms flying by the power of
[52:06] god in this age
[52:08] where no storm can touch us amen where
[52:11] nothing can happen because we're we're
[52:13] in his presence
[52:17] so what we thought was a a difficult
[52:19] time
[52:21] what we thought was terrible we look
[52:24] back and say it's wonderful
[52:29] it is the best thing that's ever
[52:30] happened to us
[52:34] and we've went through all of the
[52:36] emotions and all of the things that go
[52:38] along with that
[52:40] the the disappointment the grief
[52:43] the separation separation of friendship
[52:46] separation of those that you love
[52:48] the hardship that goes with that we even
[52:51] went through the resentment
[52:54] and the thing is you have to be honest
[52:56] with yourself
[52:59] we even went through the criticism we we
[53:01] became critics of others
[53:03] critics of those who would stay critics
[53:05] of those who would say things critics
[53:08] we became we went through criticism
[53:10] where we were the critics
[53:12] we went through uh anger and frustration
[53:15] and resentment
[53:20] but but we come to a place where we we
[53:23] realize god rescued us and brought us
[53:25] out but we look
[53:25] back almost with disdain and disgust on
[53:28] those
[53:29] who caused us problems and those who who
[53:32] separated from
[53:32] us until we got to the point where we
[53:36] realized
[53:37] the whole time i had 1200 sermons
[53:43] the whole time that was happening the
[53:46] whole time my wings were being clipped
[53:48] the whole time i became a lazy christian
[53:50] i became i fell into compromise i can't
[53:53] blame anybody i had the message
[53:56] i had 1200 books and tapes i could
[53:59] listen amen i
[54:00] i could receive from the source amen i
[54:03] can't blame anybody else it's nobody's
[54:05] fault it's my fault
[54:07] i became lazy it was my fault amen
[54:10] i was in compromise it was my fault amen
[54:13] and when i finally got over the
[54:15] resentment and passed the pain
[54:17] and to the point where i could really
[54:19] repent
[54:20] for my part then that's when god totally
[54:25] set me free amen
[54:27] now there's no more anger no more
[54:29] resentment
[54:30] no hard feelings amen no more pain
[54:33] we're just as free and happy and whole
[54:36] and healed
[54:37] because i realized it was my fault
[54:40] i can't blame anybody else it was me
[54:44] and when i finally come to a repentance
[54:46] and recognized it was
[54:47] me and fell on my face and asked god to
[54:51] forgive me
[54:52] forgive me for letting down on the word
[54:54] forgive me for not following my
[54:56] instincts
[54:57] forgive me for making excuses for others
[55:01] forgive me for getting laxed on the word
[55:03] forgive me for getting laxed in my
[55:04] holiness when i come to repentance
[55:08] god finally broke that chain
[55:12] because if you have resentment and
[55:13] regret and hurt feelings you're still
[55:15] attached to the one who hurt you
[55:18] and they still have a measure of control
[55:20] over you
[55:24] but when you can come to repent and
[55:26] recognize it's not brother so and so
[55:27] it's not this one it's not a form of
[55:29] this
[55:30] it was me god forgive me
[55:34] and then god can break that chain
[55:36] because you can forgive all of them
[55:38] because you realize
[55:39] it wasn't them god was dealing with me
[55:41] he wanted me to go higher he wanted me
[55:43] to be free
[55:44] he wanted me to come to him
[55:48] this was all about god dealing with me
[55:52] and now i can say god bless you
[55:56] you've helped me i'm not angry
[56:00] i'm not hurt not upset
[56:04] no resentment now i'm just happy
[56:09] and i pray god is doing the same for you
[56:12] that you can just be happy happy
[56:16] where you don't have to rehearse the old
[56:17] hurt and go over and over and over
[56:20] don't worry about who's saying this and
[56:22] who's saying that i don't care because
[56:24] my lord's now speaking to me
[56:26] amen that's the only voice i want to
[56:28] hear amen there's critics there's always
[56:31] been critics
[56:34] thank god for the critics
[56:36] [Music]
[56:39] there are those who fall away thank god
[56:42] for those who fall away
[56:45] evil spirits get in among men and begin
[56:47] to pervert and compromise the pureness
[56:49] of this word
[56:50] thank god because if that
[56:54] didn't follow this message this message
[56:56] wouldn't be christ
[56:58] because that followed every true revival
[57:01] of god
[57:02] and every true word of god had spirits
[57:04] that tried to pervert it
[57:05] had people who would fall away had those
[57:07] who had become critics
[57:09] and if it's not here then this isn't
[57:11] christ
[57:13] so the very presence of critics and men
[57:16] falling away
[57:17] and fallen spirits trying to come in and
[57:19] change the word and pervert it amen the
[57:21] very presence of that is evidence to you
[57:23] that this message is true
[57:26] and it is the word of god
[57:30] so instead of being upset about that get
[57:32] really happy about that
[57:34] that's all vindicating that what i
[57:35] believe is the truth
[57:40] there's no reason to be upset when god's
[57:42] on the throne
[57:44] there's no reason to be upset when he
[57:45] orders your steps
[57:47] when he's watched your way when he wants
[57:50] to deal with you
[57:52] bring you through something to open your
[57:54] eyes like they've never been open before
[57:56] bring you through something to lift you
[57:58] up higher than you've ever been before
[58:01] remember there was a storm one time that
[58:04] blew an eagle down
[58:08] brother branham was in colorado and he
[58:09] saw there was a storm and it blew an
[58:11] eagle down and that eagle was down
[58:13] but that eagle didn't stay down
[58:17] and while he was there the chatter of
[58:19] the chipmunk the chatter of the squirrel
[58:21] chatter chatter chatter chatter chatter
[58:23] chatter chatter chatter chatter
[58:25] he just looked he looked over at the
[58:28] hunter and the hunter says i have a gun
[58:30] i can kill you
[58:31] he just looked and brother ben said what
[58:34] makes that eagle so calm
[58:37] said shortly he began to stretch out
[58:39] those wings
[58:44] he began to realize the word is still
[58:48] here
[58:50] the word of god is still here the whole
[58:53] word from genesis to revelation
[58:55] the whole mind of god is still here i
[58:58] still have the power to fly away from
[59:00] the hunter
[59:00] and fly away from the chatter and go
[59:03] back where i was before the storm blew
[59:04] me down
[59:05] [Applause]
[59:10] so all i can say is be happy
[59:15] just be happy thank god
[59:20] amen it's a good day to be alive
[59:24] friends realize you didn't rescue
[59:28] yourself
[59:31] you didn't choose the word the word
[59:33] chose you
[59:36] you're here because the word chose you
[59:40] you only have the capacity to choose the
[59:42] word because the word first chose you
[59:45] because you're part of the word it's not
[59:46] what you've done it's what he did for
[59:48] you
[59:49] no pride can enter in here because we
[59:53] didn't do anything
[59:54] if i had been left to myself i would be
[59:56] in ruin but god didn't leave it to
[59:58] myself the bridegroom was here
[1:00:00] to make sure he said no more
[1:00:04] you're coming back
[1:00:07] praise god so god is good friends
[1:00:11] we love him for what he's done for us
[1:00:13] we're thankful for what he's done for
[1:00:15] you
[1:00:16] and i just tell you these are the best
[1:00:18] days
[1:00:20] to be on this earth there's not been a
[1:00:23] better time
[1:00:26] prophets and wise men have longed to see
[1:00:28] your day
[1:00:30] but god has chose you
[1:00:33] don't waste time being upset
[1:00:36] be happy let's look back here at genesis
[1:00:40] chapter 3 in genesis chapter 3
[1:00:45] verse 6 we know we we all know this so
[1:00:48] well and i've been going over this so
[1:00:50] much at home
[1:00:51] it's almost the scripture i start with
[1:00:53] almost every time i preach now
[1:00:57] because brother venom said everything
[1:00:58] started in genesis
[1:01:01] everything everything you find for the
[1:01:03] rest of the bible started in genesis
[1:01:06] and here god had one commandment for man
[1:01:08] is not to touch
[1:01:10] not to eat of the tree of the knowledge
[1:01:11] of good and evil and the serpent comes
[1:01:13] along and he begins to beguile
[1:01:15] the woman and the woman has the
[1:01:18] commandment of god she has the word of
[1:01:19] god
[1:01:21] but he begins to ask questions
[1:01:25] and everybody always thinks it's safe to
[1:01:27] ask questions but it depends on the
[1:01:29] motive of the one asking the question
[1:01:35] some questions are just they're just
[1:01:38] deception in disguise
[1:01:41] and that was the serpent's question to
[1:01:43] eve it was deception in disguise
[1:01:46] it wasn't a sincere question
[1:01:49] he was asking a question to test her
[1:01:52] to see if there's an open door here
[1:01:57] that's why brother branham said we don't
[1:01:59] have to answer the devil's questions
[1:02:05] when we get under the that that worldly
[1:02:08] layout to see
[1:02:09] an anointing thinking that we have to be
[1:02:11] the answer man to answer every question
[1:02:14] you're going to get caught in the trap
[1:02:15] of deception because brother branham
[1:02:17] said we don't have to answer the devil's
[1:02:19] questions
[1:02:22] they come and ask jesus a question one
[1:02:24] time to lay a trap for him
[1:02:26] and he says answer my question first
[1:02:32] was john the baptist was he son of god
[1:02:35] or of man
[1:02:38] they couldn't answer the question he
[1:02:39] says well neither do i answer your
[1:02:40] question
[1:02:43] so we don't have to answer the devil's
[1:02:44] question but but eve got sucked into
[1:02:47] that trap
[1:02:48] where she felt like she had to have an
[1:02:50] answer and she didn't have a good answer
[1:02:52] so she began to look at the tree
[1:02:56] before the tree had been there how long
[1:02:58] the tree had been there i don't know but
[1:03:00] the tree was there
[1:03:01] amen that that that opportunity for
[1:03:04] failure was there
[1:03:05] amen but up to this time it doesn't it
[1:03:08] doesn't appear
[1:03:09] that she had given it consideration
[1:03:11] because she had the word of god
[1:03:12] but now the question of the devil causes
[1:03:15] her to look to that tree
[1:03:16] and when she looks to the tree now she
[1:03:19] she looks and she said the woman
[1:03:21] saw that the tree was good for food
[1:03:25] and that it was pleasant to the eyes
[1:03:28] and the tree to be desired to make one
[1:03:30] wise
[1:03:33] god never said that that wasn't true
[1:03:38] god never said it wasn't pleasant to the
[1:03:42] eyes
[1:03:44] all of those things may have been true
[1:03:47] he just said don't eat it
[1:03:51] he didn't say it was ugly he didn't say
[1:03:52] it was bad he didn't say it wasn't good
[1:03:54] for wisdom
[1:03:55] what she saw what she saw was true
[1:04:00] and once she saw she began to reason
[1:04:04] she began to reason she looked at the
[1:04:06] tree in her own mind her own reasoning
[1:04:09] and she couldn't see anything wrong with
[1:04:11] it
[1:04:12] it's good for food it's pleasant to the
[1:04:15] eyes
[1:04:16] a tree to be desired to make one wise
[1:04:19] what's wrong with it
[1:04:23] what's wrong with it is it's contrary to
[1:04:26] the word
[1:04:27] [Applause]
[1:04:28] whether you understand it whether it
[1:04:30] makes sense whether you can answer the
[1:04:32] question
[1:04:33] whether you can look at it and see
[1:04:34] what's wrong with it it doesn't matter
[1:04:36] it's contrary to the word and if it's
[1:04:39] contrary
[1:04:40] to the word it brings death not life
[1:04:45] why can't i wear this and why can't i do
[1:04:47] that and why can't i and everybody wants
[1:04:49] an answer the answer is it's contrary to
[1:04:51] the word
[1:04:54] but i saw this and i don't see what's
[1:04:57] wrong with that and i don't understand
[1:04:59] and
[1:04:59] how can this harm me
[1:05:06] what's so wrong with it it looks good
[1:05:10] i see others partake of it and they're
[1:05:12] not dying
[1:05:17] it was contrary to the word
[1:05:21] and so she began by reasoning to
[1:05:23] consider the tree she wasn't supposed to
[1:05:25] consider
[1:05:27] and when she and herself couldn't find
[1:05:29] anything wrong with it
[1:05:30] she partook of the tree she gave to her
[1:05:33] husband also with her
[1:05:36] and he did also verse seven and the eyes
[1:05:40] of them both were open and they knew
[1:05:41] that they were naked and they sewed fig
[1:05:43] leaves together
[1:05:44] and made themselves aprons
[1:05:48] and brother brother banham says in the
[1:05:50] message conference he said all the
[1:05:52] hour the tremendous time that we're
[1:05:53] living when men
[1:05:55] is told of their error instead of trying
[1:05:57] to come back and say father i'm wrong
[1:05:59] forgive me
[1:06:00] they still hide behind the fig leaves
[1:06:03] fig leaves is what they sewed together
[1:06:05] themselves
[1:06:06] and that the word religion means a
[1:06:08] covering
[1:06:09] and they tried to make themselves a
[1:06:11] handmade covering
[1:06:13] and man hasn't changed yet
[1:06:16] what they did now after they partook of
[1:06:18] this tree we know
[1:06:20] that they partook of sexuality sexual
[1:06:22] relations and so what did they make
[1:06:24] they took a fiddle leaves and they sewed
[1:06:26] the fig leaves together
[1:06:27] and they made themselves a covering to
[1:06:29] cover their nakedness
[1:06:32] is that right so they're now man is now
[1:06:35] making his own covering to cover his own
[1:06:37] sin
[1:06:39] and this is the foundation of religion
[1:06:42] religion started right here with adam
[1:06:44] when adam tried to make his own religion
[1:06:46] his own covering to cover his sin
[1:06:49] and he took something that god had made
[1:06:52] god did god make the fig leaf he took
[1:06:56] something that god had made
[1:06:57] and he plucked it off and changed the
[1:07:00] purpose that god gave it for
[1:07:02] and brought it into his own purpose and
[1:07:03] he made a religion
[1:07:05] out of it and he made a covering for
[1:07:07] himself made an apron
[1:07:08] to cover himself with his own idea
[1:07:13] but listen to verse 8 and they heard the
[1:07:17] voice of the lord god
[1:07:18] walking in the garden in the cool of the
[1:07:22] day
[1:07:24] and adam and his wife hid themselves
[1:07:26] from the presence
[1:07:28] of the lord
[1:07:31] how did adam know that the presence of
[1:07:34] the lord was there
[1:07:36] did he see god no he heard his voice
[1:07:41] when he heard his voice he recognized
[1:07:44] his presence amen
[1:07:45] when he heard his voice walking in the
[1:07:47] garden in the cool of the evening
[1:07:49] in the evening time there will be a
[1:07:51] voice and that voice will mark the
[1:07:52] presence of god
[1:07:53] has come back and when the presence of
[1:07:56] god came back
[1:07:57] adam realized that his religion was
[1:08:00] insufficient
[1:08:02] because because he says
[1:08:06] it says here he says now adam and his
[1:08:09] wife
[1:08:10] hid themselves from the presence of the
[1:08:11] lord god amongst the trees of the garden
[1:08:13] and the lord god called unto adam and
[1:08:15] said unto him where art thou
[1:08:18] and he said i heard thy voice in the
[1:08:19] garden and i was afraid because
[1:08:21] i was naked and i hid myself
[1:08:25] listen technically adam was not naked
[1:08:29] adam had his religion
[1:08:33] adam was covered in his religion but in
[1:08:36] the evening time when the
[1:08:38] voice comes back amen the voice
[1:08:40] penetrates the religion
[1:08:42] and adam realized in the presence of god
[1:08:45] my religion is not sufficient to cover
[1:08:47] my sin
[1:08:48] i am still naked
[1:08:53] and that's what happened to you and i
[1:08:54] amen we heard the voice in the evening
[1:08:56] time
[1:08:57] and we knew in the presence of god amen
[1:08:59] my baptist religion my pentecostal
[1:09:01] religion
[1:09:02] my message religion it's not sufficient
[1:09:05] amen
[1:09:05] i've made something myself and i put it
[1:09:07] on myself
[1:09:08] but in the presence of god i'm still
[1:09:11] naked
[1:09:12] [Applause]
[1:09:15] that's the grace of god to us
[1:09:18] to come as a voice
[1:09:22] [Music]
[1:09:27] so let's go to verse 21.
[1:09:33] and then to adam also and to his wife
[1:09:35] did the lord god make coats of skins
[1:09:38] and clothe them in this day that the
[1:09:41] father come down he came down
[1:09:43] as he would normally come down the
[1:09:45] prophet of god tells us he would come
[1:09:47] down in the cool of the evening to have
[1:09:48] fellowship with his children
[1:09:51] because god's desire from the beginning
[1:09:53] when he began to create and begin to
[1:09:55] form himself into creation
[1:09:57] god wanted to bring his attributes out
[1:10:00] and then he wanted to have fellowship
[1:10:01] with his attributes
[1:10:03] that was god's desire god god's desire
[1:10:07] was fellowship
[1:10:08] friends he would come down in the cool
[1:10:11] of the evening to fellowship with his
[1:10:13] manifest attributes
[1:10:17] because that was his desire that's what
[1:10:20] he wanted
[1:10:22] and so he enjoyed the fellowship amen
[1:10:25] and as long as man stayed under the word
[1:10:27] the fellowship was intact
[1:10:29] but he came down this day for fellowship
[1:10:32] but something was different this day
[1:10:33] now the fellowship was broken because
[1:10:36] man left the word
[1:10:37] and when man left the word he broke his
[1:10:40] fellowship with god
[1:10:42] but god so desired his attributes he
[1:10:45] wouldn't let them go
[1:10:46] he was going to make a way in which he
[1:10:49] could bring an atonement
[1:10:50] because under that atonement would
[1:10:52] provide a covering and under the
[1:10:53] covering would restore fellowship
[1:10:57] right here in the beginning of genesis
[1:10:58] he tells us the story of the whole bible
[1:11:01] this is the whole bible that man would
[1:11:03] fall away but god himself would come
[1:11:05] down with the voice with his word
[1:11:06] amen he would expose the neckiness of
[1:11:09] the religion
[1:11:10] then he would bring a sacrificial lamb
[1:11:12] for a blood for atonement
[1:11:13] and then he would take that word that
[1:11:16] covering of the lamb the word of god
[1:11:18] and he would now clothe them in the word
[1:11:20] so he can unite them back to himself
[1:11:24] you've just read the whole bible in
[1:11:26] genesis
[1:11:28] chapter 3 when you get that picture the
[1:11:31] rest of the bible makes sense
[1:11:34] [Music]
[1:11:36] so god wouldn't let it stay there but as
[1:11:37] a good father he came down
[1:11:39] but as a good father remember we're
[1:11:41] preaching on the ministry of the father
[1:11:43] as a good father he couldn't excuse
[1:11:45] their sin
[1:11:47] as a good father he couldn't say it's
[1:11:48] okay you come here everything's fine
[1:11:51] that's not a good father the bible says
[1:11:53] it's not a good father
[1:11:55] but in a good father he would bring
[1:11:57] judgment because a good father brings
[1:11:58] judgment
[1:12:00] he would bring judgment he would judge
[1:12:02] his son he would judge his daughter he
[1:12:03] would judge the serpent
[1:12:06] but as a good father he would not let
[1:12:08] them stay in broken fellowship
[1:12:10] because the ministry of the father must
[1:12:12] bring judgment
[1:12:14] but the father who brings judgment is
[1:12:16] also responsible for reconciliation
[1:12:19] and so the the children could not
[1:12:21] reconcile themselves back to god
[1:12:23] they had nothing with which they could
[1:12:25] bring themselves to god so god himself
[1:12:28] would take a lamb
[1:12:29] the first thing that was ever slain in
[1:12:32] this creation and
[1:12:33] in eden nothing had died nothing had
[1:12:35] been slain until the father himself
[1:12:38] comes and takes the life of an instant
[1:12:40] lamb
[1:12:41] where did he get the skins to clothe him
[1:12:43] something had to die
[1:12:44] and he was foreshadowing the coming lamb
[1:12:47] the lamb of god
[1:12:48] the father's offering for his family
[1:12:52] and he slayed the lamb and shed the
[1:12:53] blood and took the covering off of the
[1:12:55] lamb
[1:12:56] and he covered his children in the
[1:12:58] covering of the lamb
[1:13:03] listen to what the prophet of god says
[1:13:04] in the message fellowship he says then
[1:13:06] god made a remedy for that
[1:13:08] in closing i might say this in the
[1:13:10] garden of eden when god saw that his
[1:13:12] children had sinned and
[1:13:13] had gone from him god himself who is the
[1:13:16] supreme judge
[1:13:19] made a reconciliation so he could
[1:13:22] restore
[1:13:22] that fellowship to his creatures by the
[1:13:24] shed blood of an animal
[1:13:27] god wanted fellowship
[1:13:30] man by sin broke fellowship but god as a
[1:13:33] father come down and judge their sins
[1:13:35] but in judging their sins he had to make
[1:13:38] a way back
[1:13:39] for fellowship so he brought an
[1:13:41] atonement that would cover their sins
[1:13:43] he brought a covering so that he could
[1:13:44] bring them back into fellowship
[1:13:48] this is the ministry of the father
[1:13:51] the father provides leadership for his
[1:13:53] children
[1:13:54] see without the message we don't even
[1:13:56] know how to be a father
[1:14:01] you can't take the the the normal
[1:14:04] standard of society
[1:14:06] you can't take what culture and society
[1:14:08] and and what's normal all around what
[1:14:10] normal
[1:14:11] what's normal around us is antichrist
[1:14:14] what has become normal to the world is
[1:14:16] counter to scripture so it's antichrist
[1:14:19] you can't take the ideas of nominal
[1:14:21] christianity who have sliced and diced
[1:14:23] the word and altered and watered it down
[1:14:25] without the message you don't know how
[1:14:27] to be a father without the message you
[1:14:29] don't know how to be a mother
[1:14:32] without the message you don't know how
[1:14:33] to be a good son
[1:14:36] because the word of god the restoration
[1:14:38] back to the word
[1:14:39] the word shows you how to be a father
[1:14:41] the word shows you how to be a mother
[1:14:43] the word shows you how to be a son or a
[1:14:45] daughter
[1:14:48] and so you look at father god he's the
[1:14:51] model father
[1:14:53] you look at jesus christ he's the model
[1:14:54] son
[1:14:56] you look at the bride of christ she's
[1:14:57] the model wife
[1:15:02] so now you know how to act if you're a
[1:15:04] wife act like the bride
[1:15:08] shows respect to your husband the way
[1:15:10] the bride shows respect to christ
[1:15:13] honor him and reverence him and cherish
[1:15:15] him
[1:15:17] but if you're a husband be the kind of
[1:15:19] husband christ is to his wife
[1:15:22] who sacrificed himself for who gives
[1:15:24] himself or who loves and cherishes her
[1:15:26] as his own body
[1:15:28] if you're a father be a father like god
[1:15:30] was a father to his children
[1:15:34] if you're a mother be the same kind of
[1:15:36] mother new jerusalem as because she's
[1:15:38] the mother of us
[1:15:39] all
[1:15:42] amen if you're worried about how to be a
[1:15:45] husband the bible tells you how to be a
[1:15:47] husband
[1:15:48] if you want to know how to be a father
[1:15:49] the bible tells you how to be a father
[1:15:51] don't go read some book in some
[1:15:53] christian bookstore by somebody who's
[1:15:55] rejected the word
[1:15:57] come back to the original source
[1:16:00] brother branham says we have one book we
[1:16:03] have no book but the bible
[1:16:05] no law but love no creed but christ
[1:16:08] let's come back to what god has restored
[1:16:11] to us and given us in this day
[1:16:15] praise god so the ministry of the father
[1:16:18] brings leadership to his children
[1:16:21] how does he bring leadership he breaks a
[1:16:24] seal
[1:16:28] what is the breaking of a seal the
[1:16:30] breaking of a seal is revealing the mind
[1:16:32] of god
[1:16:34] and revealing the mind of god is
[1:16:36] bringing leadership to his children
[1:16:40] right because without the word you have
[1:16:42] no leadership
[1:16:44] you only have leadership by the word so
[1:16:46] when he breaks a seal when he come to
[1:16:48] adam and he said don't eat of that tree
[1:16:50] he broke a seal to adam
[1:16:52] you can eat all of these but don't eat
[1:16:54] of that he broke the seal that was his
[1:16:56] mind
[1:17:00] and then when he broke the seal he gave
[1:17:02] a warning
[1:17:04] that's a trumpet because a trumpet is a
[1:17:07] minor judgment
[1:17:09] because brother bannon said to the
[1:17:10] church ages that god would break a seal
[1:17:13] he'd bring a messenger he'd break a seal
[1:17:14] bringing a revelation from
[1:17:16] god the mind of god this is good
[1:17:18] leadership
[1:17:19] this is how a father the father operates
[1:17:22] then when they would begin to get from
[1:17:23] that word he would bring a thunder a
[1:17:25] correction
[1:17:26] don't go that way bring them back a
[1:17:28] warning judgment
[1:17:30] and when they wouldn't turn back then he
[1:17:31] pours the vial out
[1:17:35] that's how the father operates amen he
[1:17:38] breaks the seal
[1:17:39] amen if you have a little son or a
[1:17:40] little daughter amen you can't go to the
[1:17:42] vial and bring chastisement amen and
[1:17:44] bring
[1:17:45] and bring a correction and begin to
[1:17:46] bring a rod amen when you've never
[1:17:48] broke the seal first you have to tell
[1:17:52] them what's in your mind
[1:17:54] [Music]
[1:17:55] i want you to do this i don't want you
[1:17:57] to do that this is what i expect this is
[1:17:59] what i
[1:17:59] i don't expect god never went straight
[1:18:03] to the vial
[1:18:04] he he went to the seal first
[1:18:09] then after he broke the seal and his
[1:18:11] children starts to get away
[1:18:12] he brings a voice of thunder to bring
[1:18:14] correction
[1:18:18] and then when they reviews the thunder
[1:18:20] then they go into the vile he brings a
[1:18:24] judgment
[1:18:26] so our children get frustrated
[1:18:29] when we don't follow the pattern god
[1:18:31] laid out
[1:18:34] you have a mother or a father amen they
[1:18:36] don't take the time to break the seal
[1:18:38] but all they do is thunder thunder
[1:18:40] thunder thunder
[1:18:41] thunder but the children don't even know
[1:18:43] what's expected they don't even know why
[1:18:45] what am i supposed to do how do you want
[1:18:47] me to act
[1:18:47] but every time they do something wrong
[1:18:49] thunder or worse than that
[1:18:51] vile vile vile
[1:18:56] but god showed us how to be a father
[1:18:58] first thing we do for our children is
[1:19:00] break the seal
[1:19:02] the next thing we do is we bring a
[1:19:04] thunder say no that wasn't what i said
[1:19:06] that was wrong you come and stand beside
[1:19:07] me
[1:19:10] next time it'll be worse
[1:19:13] and if they push past the thunder then
[1:19:15] we bring the vile of the rod
[1:19:18] according to the scriptures but the
[1:19:21] reason we have children who rebel
[1:19:23] against their parents is because they
[1:19:24] haven't taken the model that god has
[1:19:26] given us
[1:19:27] because the model that god has given us
[1:19:29] is just is righteous
[1:19:31] is holy and is pure
[1:19:35] if you bring the if you break the seal
[1:19:37] correctly
[1:19:39] say you don't need dr dobson you just
[1:19:40] need the bible
[1:19:42] [Music]
[1:19:43] if you break the seal correctly
[1:19:46] the children now know right and wrong
[1:19:50] they clearly know what's expected
[1:19:53] and when they do something different
[1:19:55] than what you expected they
[1:19:57] willfully chose to do wrong
[1:20:00] so then when you bring a thunder to
[1:20:02] remind them of the rule and to remind
[1:20:04] them that judgment's coming
[1:20:05] it's righteous it's holy it's pure
[1:20:10] and then after that thunder they go
[1:20:12] further into their own will
[1:20:14] now it's righteous holy and pure to
[1:20:17] bring correction
[1:20:18] and it's actually ungodly not to bring
[1:20:20] the vile
[1:20:23] now by letting it go you become
[1:20:25] antichrist again because you didn't
[1:20:26] follow the pattern of the word
[1:20:31] and if we would just take god's pattern
[1:20:32] to raising our children we'd have
[1:20:33] children who knows what's expected
[1:20:35] somebody's taken the time to explain it
[1:20:37] to them
[1:20:37] they've given them their mind and now
[1:20:39] they know what's right or wrong when
[1:20:40] they come past that they know that they
[1:20:42] chose to do wrong and they know they
[1:20:43] deserve punishment
[1:20:45] they're not wondering why i'm always
[1:20:47] getting yelled at why is mom always
[1:20:48] screaming why is dallas yelling
[1:20:49] why does dad all of a sudden get super
[1:20:51] angry and come over and chastise me
[1:20:54] no by the time you get there they know
[1:20:57] and when you tell them what's going to
[1:20:58] happen they're like
[1:20:59] yes
[1:21:00] [Music]
[1:21:03] because it's god's pattern
[1:21:06] it works in churches for church
[1:21:08] discipline amen
[1:21:10] it works in businesses if you're a
[1:21:11] supervisor because god's pattern of
[1:21:14] leadership works
[1:21:18] so the ministry of the father is to
[1:21:19] bring leadership
[1:21:22] and the ministry of the father is to
[1:21:24] bring correction
[1:21:27] and then the ministry of the father is
[1:21:28] to bring restoration
[1:21:31] it's the father's responsibility to
[1:21:33] reconcile
[1:21:34] with the child
[1:21:38] let's go to first corinthians
[1:21:55] first corinthians chapter 11 verse 31
[1:22:00] this is the scripture we always read at
[1:22:02] communion
[1:22:04] i'd like to look at this in verse 31 for
[1:22:06] if we would judge ourselves
[1:22:08] we should not be judged but when we
[1:22:12] are judged if we fail to judge ourselves
[1:22:15] by the word that's been given to us then
[1:22:17] the father will judge us
[1:22:19] he gives us an opportunity by breaking
[1:22:21] the seal for us to judge ourselves
[1:22:24] how else would you judge yourself if not
[1:22:25] by the word
[1:22:28] but when we are judged we are chastened
[1:22:30] to the lord
[1:22:31] that we should not be condemned with the
[1:22:34] world
[1:22:35] the reason the father chastens us is so
[1:22:38] we will not be condemned with the world
[1:22:42] he doesn't chasten us to chasten us he
[1:22:45] doesn't
[1:22:45] chasten us for punishment god's desire
[1:22:48] for his children is not punishment
[1:22:50] god's desire for his children is
[1:22:52] reconciliation
[1:22:54] god will judge us and bring us to
[1:22:55] chastisement so that we will not be lost
[1:22:58] with the world
[1:22:59] he's got a he's a father he's watching
[1:23:01] over his children
[1:23:02] those that aren't his children they can
[1:23:03] go but you that are his child you get
[1:23:05] away
[1:23:06] with nothing amen because he will not
[1:23:08] let you be lost with the world
[1:23:13] hebrews chapter 12 let's turn there and
[1:23:18] look
[1:23:21] hebrews chapter 12 verse 5. it says
[1:23:34] and you have forgotten the exhortation
[1:23:36] which speaketh unto you as unto children
[1:23:39] my son despise not the chastening of the
[1:23:41] lord nor faint when thou are rebuked of
[1:23:43] him
[1:23:44] for whom the lord loveth he chasteneth
[1:23:46] and scourges every son whom he receiveth
[1:23:48] if you endure chastening god deals with
[1:23:51] you as with sons
[1:23:52] for what son is he whom the father
[1:23:54] chasteneth not
[1:23:56] but if you be without chastisement we're
[1:23:58] of all our partakers then you are a
[1:23:59] bastard and not sons
[1:24:01] furthermore we have had fathers of our
[1:24:03] flesh which corrected us and we gave
[1:24:05] them reverence
[1:24:06] shall we not much more rather be in
[1:24:07] subjection unto the father of spirits
[1:24:10] and live for they verily for a few days
[1:24:13] chastened us after their own pleasure
[1:24:15] but he for our prophet that we might be
[1:24:18] partakers
[1:24:19] of his holiness he said your fathers
[1:24:23] he's speaking the gentiles amen your
[1:24:25] fathers before
[1:24:26] they chastened you after their own
[1:24:27] pleasure but god chastened you for your
[1:24:29] own good
[1:24:30] so that you'll be a partaker of his
[1:24:32] holiness
[1:24:34] that's the ministry of the father i'll
[1:24:37] look at a few more scriptures let's go
[1:24:38] to proverbs and
[1:24:39] look at a few scriptures and proverbs
[1:24:45] this isn't the main thrust of what i
[1:24:47] want to speak but it lays a good
[1:24:48] foundation
[1:24:50] proverbs chapter 13.
[1:24:58] proverbs 13
[1:25:03] he that spareth his rod hateth his son
[1:25:06] be he that loveth him chasteneth him be
[1:25:08] times
[1:25:10] why because the father loves us
[1:25:14] chapter 29 proverbs 29
[1:25:21] chapter 29 verse 17.
[1:25:26] correct thy son and he shall give thee
[1:25:28] rest
[1:25:30] what's the purpose not because you're
[1:25:33] angry
[1:25:34] not because you're mad that wasn't god's
[1:25:36] purpose
[1:25:38] correct thy son and he shall give thee
[1:25:40] rest
[1:25:41] yea he shall give delight unto thy
[1:25:44] soul paragraph 23
[1:25:52] and 12.
[1:25:55] apply thine heart unto instruction and
[1:25:57] thine ears to the words of knowledge
[1:26:00] withhold not correction from thy child
[1:26:02] for if thou beatest him with the rod he
[1:26:03] shall not die
[1:26:05] thou shalt beat him with the rod and
[1:26:06] shalt deliver his soul
[1:26:08] from hell my son
[1:26:11] if thine heart be wise my heart shall
[1:26:13] rejoice
[1:26:15] even mine what is the purpose
[1:26:18] wisdom all the correction was to bring
[1:26:21] wisdom and he said
[1:26:22] son if thine heart be wise my heart
[1:26:25] heart shall rejoice even mine yea my
[1:26:27] rain shall rejoice when thy lips
[1:26:29] speak right things
[1:26:33] oh i would like to say that god has
[1:26:35] brought a
[1:26:36] correction in this day through the
[1:26:39] prophet of god
[1:26:40] amen that prophet of god came down with
[1:26:42] a rod of the word and he spanked
[1:26:44] every denomination amen he spanked the
[1:26:47] laodicean church age
[1:26:49] and he brought a great correction a hard
[1:26:51] correction
[1:26:52] a firm correction amen because they had
[1:26:54] switched straight from the word amen
[1:26:56] they had all gone their own way all the
[1:26:58] tables had become as vomit
[1:27:01] he sent a prophet down with the rod of
[1:27:02] the word and he spanked them for false
[1:27:04] baptism he
[1:27:05] spanked them for all the other things
[1:27:07] that they were after but what was the
[1:27:08] purpose of the spanking
[1:27:10] the purpose was reconciliation so that
[1:27:12] you have wisdom that my heart will
[1:27:14] delight in your wisdom
[1:27:15] and my reigns will rejoice when your
[1:27:17] words speak wise words when you speak of
[1:27:19] knowledge
[1:27:20] amen and god has brought his children in
[1:27:22] this day through the correction from a
[1:27:24] prophet because a prophet brings
[1:27:25] correction
[1:27:27] and through the correction of a prophet
[1:27:29] he has brought up a people who have been
[1:27:30] corrected corrected
[1:27:32] from wrong thinking corrected from wrong
[1:27:33] dressing corrected from wrong speaking
[1:27:36] corrected from false doctrines corrected
[1:27:38] from wrong spirits
[1:27:39] we have been spanked and spanked and
[1:27:41] spanked and spanked and he broke the
[1:27:43] seals and he broke the seals and he
[1:27:45] broke the seals
[1:27:46] so that he could have a people that will
[1:27:47] speak right words
[1:27:50] that will think right thoughts amen that
[1:27:53] will bring delight to his heart that
[1:27:55] will bring
[1:27:55] joy to his inward parts god is delighted
[1:27:59] amen
[1:28:00] when a son begins to act like the father
[1:28:04] brother ben told us the story in
[1:28:05] adoption he said the holy ghost was sin
[1:28:07] as a tutor
[1:28:08] amen and he got uh he's taking the story
[1:28:10] of two different signs and one is not
[1:28:12] the right kind of sign
[1:28:13] but one is the correct kind of sign and
[1:28:15] the wrong sign is doing wrong he's not
[1:28:17] listening to the tutor
[1:28:19] and the father is displeased but the
[1:28:22] tutor comes along with the right sign
[1:28:24] and he says listen i saw him do this and
[1:28:26] i saw him do that
[1:28:28] and oh he's just like you
[1:28:34] that brings delight to the father's
[1:28:36] hearts
[1:28:37] that brings joy and pleasure to the
[1:28:40] heart of our father
[1:28:42] what does he want what does god want
[1:28:44] friends
[1:28:46] he wants fellowship but god cannot have
[1:28:49] fellowship with sin he cannot
[1:28:51] fellowship with perversion he cannot
[1:28:53] have fellowship with something that's
[1:28:54] polluted
[1:28:55] amen in order to have the right kind of
[1:28:57] fellowship he has to bring an atonement
[1:28:59] and when he brings that atonement
[1:29:00] there's a washing
[1:29:01] and with a washing comes a covering and
[1:29:03] with a covering comes a reconciliation
[1:29:06] back to fellowship again what did god
[1:29:08] want in this age
[1:29:09] not just correct denominations not to
[1:29:11] just correct dress
[1:29:12] and doctrine amen that was just the
[1:29:14] beginning amen what he really wanted to
[1:29:16] do was bring you his mind amen
[1:29:18] bring you his understanding so that you
[1:29:20] would think his thoughts amen
[1:29:22] so that you would see with eyes that see
[1:29:24] like god sees so you would read your
[1:29:26] bible the way god would read his bible
[1:29:31] so that we could come back the goal was
[1:29:34] restored fellowship
[1:29:37] let's take a look at luke chapter 15.
[1:29:49] luke chapter 15.
[1:29:56] and let's go to verse 11.
[1:30:04] and a certain man had two sons
[1:30:07] and the younger of them said to his
[1:30:08] father father give me the portion of
[1:30:10] goods that followed to me
[1:30:12] and he divided unto him as living and
[1:30:14] not many days after the younger son
[1:30:16] gathered all together and took his
[1:30:17] journey into a far country
[1:30:19] and there wasted his substance with
[1:30:21] riotous living
[1:30:23] and when he had spent all there arose a
[1:30:25] mighty famine in that land and he began
[1:30:27] to be in one
[1:30:29] and he went and joined himself to a
[1:30:30] citizen of that country and he
[1:30:33] sent him into the fields to feed swine
[1:30:36] and he would have feigned filled his
[1:30:38] belly with the husk that swine did eat
[1:30:40] and no man gave unto him and when he
[1:30:43] come to himself
[1:30:44] he said how many hired servants of my
[1:30:46] fathers have bread enough to
[1:30:48] to spare and i perish with hunger i will
[1:30:51] arise and go to my father
[1:30:54] see he came to himself
[1:30:58] there was a time that we came to
[1:31:00] ourselves
[1:31:02] and we were in a far country and we
[1:31:05] became a servant to the task masters
[1:31:08] of laodicea and he had long forgotten
[1:31:12] his heritage who he was who his father
[1:31:14] was and
[1:31:15] he had gone out with the life that had
[1:31:17] been given to him because god had given
[1:31:19] us a life when we come to this earth and
[1:31:20] we began to waste our life
[1:31:23] through riotous living and we got to
[1:31:26] where our life was falling into poverty
[1:31:30] and we became a slave to the very system
[1:31:32] of laodicea
[1:31:35] so much so that we were willing to eat
[1:31:37] pigs food
[1:31:41] at the movie theaters and in the arcades
[1:31:44] and in the places of entertainment and
[1:31:46] on netflix and on
[1:31:48] we were willing to eat pig food
[1:31:53] but somehow he come to himself
[1:31:59] said who am i what am i doing here
[1:32:03] why am i willing to eat pig's food amen
[1:32:06] i'm a sheep not a pig and he come to
[1:32:12] himself
[1:32:14] he said i would rather be a servant in
[1:32:16] my father's house than be in this
[1:32:18] condition
[1:32:20] he was broken amen he come to humility
[1:32:23] he realized he had failed and he was a
[1:32:25] failure and he was no good
[1:32:26] and was not worthy to be called a son of
[1:32:29] god
[1:32:32] what a wonderful place to be in
[1:32:36] he said i will arise and go to my father
[1:32:38] and will say unto him father i have
[1:32:40] sinned against heaven and before thee
[1:32:42] i am no more worthy to be called thy son
[1:32:45] make me as one of thy hired servants
[1:32:47] what did he do he came in true
[1:32:50] repentance
[1:32:51] and true humility
[1:32:54] true repentance and true humility was
[1:32:56] well you know i messed up but i'm okay
[1:32:58] i'm back now
[1:33:00] god i'm back father i'm back
[1:33:03] where's my room you keep my room how's
[1:33:06] where's all my stuff
[1:33:09] that's not how he came back he came back
[1:33:12] through true repentance and true
[1:33:14] humility
[1:33:15] he knew he was not worthy
[1:33:18] he knew he didn't even deserve to be a
[1:33:21] servant but he would be
[1:33:22] happy just to be a servant in the house
[1:33:24] of his father than to live in the world
[1:33:26] another day
[1:33:27] and he come back through humility and he
[1:33:29] come back in reverence to his father
[1:33:31] and he come back with respect and he
[1:33:33] come back and said i'll just be one of
[1:33:35] thy hired servants
[1:33:39] when you see the response of the son
[1:33:43] it shows you why there was a certain
[1:33:45] response of the father
[1:33:50] verse 20 and he arose and he came to his
[1:33:52] father but when he was yet great way off
[1:33:54] his father saw him
[1:33:55] and had compassion and ran and fell on
[1:33:57] his neck and kissed him
[1:34:00] and the son said unto them father i have
[1:34:01] sinned against heaven and in thy sight
[1:34:03] and am no more worthy to be called thy
[1:34:05] son
[1:34:06] but the father said to his servants
[1:34:08] bring forth the best robe
[1:34:09] and put it on him and put a ring on his
[1:34:11] hand and shoes on his feet
[1:34:13] and bring hither the fatted calf and
[1:34:15] kill it and let us be merry
[1:34:18] amen you see the ministry of the father
[1:34:21] at work here because the ministry of the
[1:34:22] father
[1:34:23] is to bring reconciliation amen he's not
[1:34:26] to bring
[1:34:26] punishment amen the boy already served
[1:34:29] his own punishment
[1:34:31] he already suffered of his own choices
[1:34:33] he was already
[1:34:34] humbled by the correction he was already
[1:34:38] repentant he already come with respect
[1:34:40] amen and so now the father doesn't have
[1:34:43] to bring chastisement there's already
[1:34:45] been chastisement he's looking at the
[1:34:47] fruits of chastisement
[1:34:49] and the fruit of chastisement is true
[1:34:51] repentance with humility
[1:34:54] with reverence and respect and when the
[1:34:57] father said that he said
[1:34:59] bring the robe bring the shoes bring the
[1:35:02] ring
[1:35:02] for my son which is dead is now alive
[1:35:06] that's why god as a father he's never
[1:35:10] interested in correction for corrections
[1:35:12] sake he's always interested in
[1:35:13] correction for reconciliation sake
[1:35:16] because the father wants fellowship
[1:35:21] that's why some people get so angry when
[1:35:23] the pastor starts bringing correction
[1:35:25] and say why does he say this and why is
[1:35:27] he always harping on that
[1:35:29] amen it's a ministry of a father
[1:35:32] because the father is not here to bring
[1:35:34] punishment and chastisement
[1:35:36] and doesn't enjoy i don't know a good
[1:35:38] father who enjoys chastisement
[1:35:40] if he enjoys chastisement he's not got
[1:35:42] the heart of a good father
[1:35:45] but chastisement is necessary for
[1:35:48] reconciliation
[1:35:50] because breaking the word of god god
[1:35:53] cannot
[1:35:54] dwell with perversion on the word he
[1:35:56] can't dwell when the word is broken
[1:35:59] the fellowship between god and his
[1:36:00] children was broken when they left the
[1:36:02] word
[1:36:02] and if we're still leaving the word
[1:36:04] we're breaking fellowship
[1:36:06] so god will send the ministry along and
[1:36:08] that ministry is speaking the word of
[1:36:10] god
[1:36:11] bringing chastisement because the goal
[1:36:13] is reconciliation back to the father
[1:36:19] i've seen people under correction and i
[1:36:21] don't mean harping on something word
[1:36:23] correction
[1:36:23] by the what the prophet has told us
[1:36:25] matched with the word of god
[1:36:27] bring a correction and they'll leave the
[1:36:28] church to go somewhere else where
[1:36:30] they're not harped on so that they can
[1:36:32] still be a message believer in their fig
[1:36:36] leaves
[1:36:39] because they've taken the message and
[1:36:41] they've stitched it together in a
[1:36:43] certain way
[1:36:47] and they put it as a robe and feel like
[1:36:51] because i used quotes
[1:36:52] and i stitched them together and make a
[1:36:54] robe i'm now covered
[1:36:55] but i tell you when there's a real
[1:36:57] anointing of a holy ghost filled
[1:36:59] minister
[1:36:59] he'll make that road nakedness
[1:37:03] it's the voice of god and the presence
[1:37:05] of god will pierce through the robe
[1:37:07] of quotes used the wrong way stitched
[1:37:10] together to serve our own purpose
[1:37:12] bringing us back to the intention of
[1:37:13] what the father wanted
[1:37:15] with that quote because if you
[1:37:18] if you take the quote and use it
[1:37:20] differently than the mind of god
[1:37:22] then you've perverted the very quote
[1:37:24] that you're using
[1:37:29] amen but to bring it back to the mind of
[1:37:32] god
[1:37:33] and bring it back to the word amen what
[1:37:35] the prophet has said and why he said it
[1:37:37] will bring a correction that will bring
[1:37:39] reconciliation back to the fallen
[1:37:48] so when god brings correction say thank
[1:37:50] you
[1:37:53] because if we would just judge ourselves
[1:37:55] by the word we wouldn't be judged
[1:37:58] but when we are judged we are chaste
[1:37:59] unto the lord so that we will not be
[1:38:02] lost with the world and if god threw a
[1:38:04] ministry through a tape through your
[1:38:06] brother your sister however he brings it
[1:38:08] if he brings correction to you that
[1:38:09] brings a chastisement
[1:38:11] say praise god my father loves me so
[1:38:13] much he won't let me get lost with the
[1:38:15] world
[1:38:20] what does it feel like sometimes
[1:38:23] the pastor has a camera set up in your
[1:38:26] room and a listening device in your car
[1:38:35] why is it sometimes the husband's asking
[1:38:36] the wife did you call him
[1:38:46] you look at your kids and like you've
[1:38:48] been talking to people at church
[1:38:53] no it's the father it's the ministry of
[1:38:56] the father
[1:38:57] the father brings judgment but with the
[1:39:00] judgment he'll bring an atonement
[1:39:02] and with the atonement comes a covering
[1:39:04] and with the covering comes a
[1:39:10] reconciliation
[1:39:12] in the message the super sign the
[1:39:14] prophet of god says adam
[1:39:17] he tried to make a super religion
[1:39:19] without
[1:39:20] an atonement there was no atonement
[1:39:25] in adam's religion said they're still
[1:39:28] trying to do it a super religion make a
[1:39:30] religion so he could live any way he
[1:39:32] wanted to
[1:39:34] without an atonement and still
[1:39:37] have a covering he tried to do it in the
[1:39:40] beginning and he is still trying to do
[1:39:42] it
[1:39:43] but god's provided way was an atonement
[1:39:45] and it'll never work no other way it has
[1:39:48] to come back
[1:39:49] to an atonement i want to look at the
[1:39:52] word atonement
[1:39:54] i like this board i watched a service
[1:39:58] where brother stephen was preaching and
[1:40:01] i said i like that board
[1:40:07] we're going to look at the word
[1:40:08] atonement
[1:40:17] atonement
[1:40:20] at 1.
[1:40:29] what does god want he wants you to be
[1:40:31] one with him
[1:40:33] what was the purpose of the atonement to
[1:40:36] bring back the oneness with god sin
[1:40:38] separates leaving the word separate but
[1:40:40] the atonement brings us back
[1:40:43] the atonement was so that we could be at
[1:40:46] one
[1:40:46] with god it was god's idea it was his
[1:40:50] concept it's his desire
[1:40:52] it's what he wants amen
[1:40:58] now listen to this quote in the
[1:41:00] indictment
[1:41:02] and that's the one place that he meets
[1:41:04] with man today is under the shed blood
[1:41:06] of the sacrifice see he told us in super
[1:41:10] sign
[1:41:10] that he wants a super religion without
[1:41:12] an atonement
[1:41:14] that was cain's religion
[1:41:17] because abel caught a revelation and
[1:41:20] that revelation
[1:41:21] amen was was uh that revelation was his
[1:41:25] faith by faith which is a revelation
[1:41:27] god revealed to him what the proper way
[1:41:30] of worship was and it was through the
[1:41:32] atonement
[1:41:33] through the blood without the shedding
[1:41:35] of blood
[1:41:37] there's no atonement there's no
[1:41:38] forgiveness of sins
[1:41:40] so abel he had
[1:41:43] no means to be reconciled to god by his
[1:41:47] own thinking
[1:41:50] he had to wait for a revelation from god
[1:41:55] cain did not wait for a revelation cain
[1:41:57] started working
[1:41:59] they knew there was going to be a time
[1:42:01] to worship god a time to come
[1:42:03] amen to the gate of eden time to offer a
[1:42:05] sacrifice
[1:42:06] and they knew that and they began to
[1:42:08] work amen and so
[1:42:09] cain began to labor he began to plant
[1:42:12] began to till
[1:42:12] began to pull weeds began to do
[1:42:14] everything that you would do
[1:42:16] to bring forth flowers and fruits and
[1:42:18] vegetables to present the god
[1:42:19] he couldn't start the day before how
[1:42:21] long had cain been working to bring the
[1:42:23] sacrifice
[1:42:24] and brother brown said he built a
[1:42:26] beautiful altar
[1:42:28] carved it out of stone and set
[1:42:29] everything just right and made it
[1:42:31] beautiful according to
[1:42:32] everything he thought god would want but
[1:42:35] he did it with no revelation
[1:42:37] it was all wisdom intellect
[1:42:42] abel comes over here and abel is not
[1:42:44] working
[1:42:46] because it's not by works it's by faith
[1:42:50] abel's got nothing he can do to please
[1:42:52] god
[1:42:54] i mean when abel begins to think how can
[1:42:56] i please god abel can come up with
[1:42:58] nothing
[1:42:59] what can i do to make god happy what can
[1:43:01] i do to please god what can i do
[1:43:03] how can i give god something he doesn't
[1:43:05] already have
[1:43:07] what can i give to god cain thought i'll
[1:43:10] give him something i made something i
[1:43:12] worked for something eyebrow
[1:43:14] i i i i i it's the spirit of lucifer
[1:43:18] it's the spirit of religion it's the
[1:43:20] spirit of denomination
[1:43:23] i'll worship god the way i want i'll
[1:43:25] believe what i want to believe i'll sing
[1:43:27] the way i want to sing i'll take the
[1:43:29] doctrine i want to believe
[1:43:31] if this church doesn't agree with me
[1:43:33] i'll go to a church that agrees with me
[1:43:36] i i i i
[1:43:40] able just waits
[1:43:44] can you imagine the conversation where
[1:43:46] cain he's working he's diligent his
[1:43:48] garden is beautiful the plants are
[1:43:49] coming up
[1:43:50] he's keeping the weeds out he's shoeing
[1:43:52] the animals away
[1:43:55] and abel and cain have a conversation
[1:43:59] cain says what are you going to offer to
[1:44:01] the lord
[1:44:02] abel says i'm not sure yet
[1:44:08] and cain says but we're getting near the
[1:44:11] time
[1:44:12] that we offer a sacrifice to the lord
[1:44:16] and abel says but i'm not sure what to
[1:44:19] give him
[1:44:23] he can look over and see all that cain's
[1:44:25] doing
[1:44:26] who's working harder
[1:44:30] who put forth a greater effort where is
[1:44:33] the beauty
[1:44:41] he can look over and no doubt abel can
[1:44:43] have a little self-doubt
[1:44:47] am i really doing all that i should do
[1:44:52] i mean look at how look at how kane
[1:44:55] feeds the poor
[1:44:56] and he has a homeless shelter they take
[1:44:59] care of orphans and they build churches
[1:45:07] but i have nothing
[1:45:10] and you know the devil is not new and
[1:45:13] edgy just showed up and landed on your
[1:45:14] shoulder to begin to talking to you
[1:45:18] abel is wondering what can i give what
[1:45:21] can i do
[1:45:23] what will please the lord
[1:45:27] cain has his own ideas he doesn't wait
[1:45:30] on the lord he just moves forward with
[1:45:31] his own ideas
[1:45:34] but one day abel is just sitting there
[1:45:39] he's thinking what does god want what
[1:45:41] does god want
[1:45:43] and all sudden forgive me for
[1:45:45] dramatizing
[1:45:49] this isn't a quote this is just brother
[1:45:51] chad
[1:45:52] break it down he thinks
[1:45:57] why are we out here anyways why aren't
[1:46:00] we in the garden
[1:46:05] what happened
[1:46:13] why am i on the east side of eden and
[1:46:16] locked out of the gate
[1:46:20] what was it mom said
[1:46:22] [Music]
[1:46:24] what was it she said that they did
[1:46:27] something wrong
[1:46:31] brother branham said both of them heard
[1:46:33] the same story
[1:46:36] one of them thought it was fruit
[1:46:40] so he's going to offer fruit
[1:46:43] the other one heard fruit but he was
[1:46:46] saying what kind of fruit
[1:46:52] what kind of fruit was that
[1:46:56] he says what was that that dad said
[1:46:59] god did he killed
[1:47:02] he took one of the lambs and he killed
[1:47:03] it and made skins and that's why i'm
[1:47:06] wearing this today
[1:47:09] why and all of a sudden as he was
[1:47:12] walking back
[1:47:14] bing it drops
[1:47:22] i know why i'm wearing this garment i
[1:47:25] know why
[1:47:26] god killed a lamb why would god who
[1:47:29] created everything kill
[1:47:30] why would god slay why would god start
[1:47:33] bloodshed
[1:47:34] why would god clothe them in skins why
[1:47:36] am i wearing this amen why am i outside
[1:47:38] of the garden
[1:47:39] all of a sudden in a moment of
[1:47:40] revelation he understood it all
[1:47:42] he knew why he was wearing skids he knew
[1:47:44] why god had slayed a left he knew why he
[1:47:47] was outside the garden
[1:47:52] and now just as happy as can be he goes
[1:47:55] and he gets one of his lambs he says i
[1:47:56] know what god wants amen
[1:47:58] i know what will bring the relationship
[1:48:00] back i know how to please the lord
[1:48:04] he goes back
[1:48:05] [Applause]
[1:48:09] he looks over his lambs
[1:48:10] [Applause]
[1:48:12] and i gotta find the perfect one no
[1:48:15] splot
[1:48:16] no no blemish nothing wrong so brother
[1:48:19] ben said he takes a little vine
[1:48:21] and he ties it around his neck and he
[1:48:24] comes dragging it
[1:48:29] dragging it
[1:48:32] now come over here and look at kane
[1:48:35] hewnstone beautiful altar he's carrying
[1:48:39] his vegetables over he's got the fruit
[1:48:40] laid out and all the flowers in place
[1:48:44] he's sitting back he goes to this side
[1:48:48] no no no that's not right i got to get
[1:48:50] the purple one in front of the pink
[1:48:54] he's doing it according to his own
[1:48:56] thinking according to his own
[1:48:58] understanding
[1:48:59] he's worshipping god in a way that
[1:49:01] pleases him
[1:49:03] not in a way that pleases god
[1:49:06] [Applause]
[1:49:09] amen and the fallacy and
[1:49:12] denominationalism is they worship god in
[1:49:14] a way that pleases them
[1:49:16] not in a way that pleases god they want
[1:49:19] to worship because god man has a
[1:49:21] god-shaped void
[1:49:22] and man has a desire to worship man
[1:49:24] wants to worship so the devil offers him
[1:49:26] religion
[1:49:27] with the name of christianity tacked
[1:49:29] onto it with no word amen
[1:49:32] just portions enough word to make them
[1:49:33] think they're christian so that they can
[1:49:35] continue worship god the way they want
[1:49:37] to worship god
[1:49:41] and look down on abel as abel comes
[1:49:44] dragging his pitiful little lamb
[1:49:49] and he's got it all arranged just right
[1:49:51] and he steps back and says
[1:49:53] that's good god will surely accept me
[1:49:56] now
[1:49:58] i've worked for nine months
[1:50:01] i've labored i've got it just right
[1:50:05] and he looks over and here comes abel
[1:50:07] smile on his face
[1:50:12] he's dragging a little lamb
[1:50:16] because he now knows what god wants and
[1:50:18] why god wants it
[1:50:19] the word has been revealed to him he's
[1:50:21] got a revelation of the word all the way
[1:50:23] from eden he knows what to do
[1:50:25] now he drags this little lamb
[1:50:31] and brother branham said no beautiful
[1:50:32] alternative he just flips over a flat
[1:50:35] [Music]
[1:50:36] rock he takes that lamb and he wrestles
[1:50:39] it down
[1:50:41] sticks his knee on its head his knee in
[1:50:43] his side and he grabs a sharp rock and
[1:50:45] he begins to hack at his throat
[1:50:46] and the thing begins to squall and
[1:50:48] deplete and the gurgle and he's got
[1:50:50] mud on him from the feet of the lamb and
[1:50:53] he's got blood all over him
[1:50:54] he's sweating with the effort and he
[1:50:56] stands up and it's hacked to pieces it's
[1:50:58] dead blood all over
[1:51:00] mud on him blood on him and god looks
[1:51:02] down and says
[1:51:03] that's beautiful to me that's what i
[1:51:06] want
[1:51:07] because it's by revelation of my word
[1:51:12] [Applause]
[1:51:17] now now you know why cain was so
[1:51:21] angry because it said cain was roth
[1:51:26] god how can you look at that it's dirty
[1:51:30] it smells it's filthy
[1:51:33] look what he did to that lamb look what
[1:51:36] i've done with your nature
[1:51:39] look what i've given and god says i
[1:51:42] refuse yours
[1:51:44] because it had none of my mind attached
[1:51:47] to him
[1:51:48] but abel by faith offered a more
[1:51:51] excellent sacrifice
[1:51:53] than came in it didn't say
[1:51:58] cain did not offer an excellent
[1:51:59] sacrifice
[1:52:01] but abel had a more excellent second
[1:52:05] cain had an excellent sacrifice because
[1:52:07] it was the sacrifice of first fruits
[1:52:10] which would come later in the law he had
[1:52:12] actually offered something that was good
[1:52:15] but not by revelation but by his own
[1:52:17] will
[1:52:18] abel offered by faith revelation
[1:52:21] and god accepted his and refused cain
[1:52:24] and cain became angry
[1:52:27] after all i've done for you after all
[1:52:29] i've worked for you after all
[1:52:31] look at the look at the very nature of
[1:52:33] lucifer himself in cain
[1:52:36] but abel had the humility of christ
[1:52:42] cain offered a sacrifice with no
[1:52:45] atonement
[1:52:48] and because there was no atonement there
[1:52:49] was no reconciliation
[1:52:52] abel by faith offered a sacrifice
[1:52:54] according to the word
[1:52:56] according to a divine revelation of the
[1:52:58] word and with his sacrifice
[1:53:00] there was an atonement and with an
[1:53:01] atonement god accepted him in a
[1:53:04] sacrifice
[1:53:06] if we're going to worship god we have to
[1:53:09] find the atonement
[1:53:12] we have to come by revelation what's the
[1:53:14] atonement
[1:53:15] how do i atone how because i come back
[1:53:18] in oneness with god
[1:53:19] what is it he's looking for in my day
[1:53:21] what is it he wants from me
[1:53:22] how can i please him amen and we got to
[1:53:25] come by revelation friends
[1:53:29] not our efforts our efforts don't mean
[1:53:30] anything to god he doesn't need our
[1:53:32] efforts he created all the world by a
[1:53:34] spoken word he doesn't need anything
[1:53:36] that you can do for him
[1:53:37] he's looking for a reconciliation of his
[1:53:39] manifest attributes
[1:53:40] he's bringing himself back together
[1:53:44] and the method for bringing himself back
[1:53:46] together is by divine revelation
[1:53:51] he made it by faith so that it could be
[1:53:54] by grace
[1:53:56] so that the promise would be sure to the
[1:53:58] elect because the elect would get it by
[1:54:00] faith
[1:54:02] everybody else by intellectualism by
[1:54:04] wisdom by their own knowledge and own
[1:54:06] understanding would miss it
[1:54:09] no matter how close they got they would
[1:54:10] miss it
[1:54:12] because you only get it by revelation
[1:54:19] brother ben said in the message things
[1:54:21] that are to be
[1:54:23] you told me to take my time brother
[1:54:25] right
[1:54:28] praise god
[1:54:31] i'll pay the overtime fees
[1:54:37] amen amen
[1:54:42] brother branham said a child of god can
[1:54:44] listen to the word hour
[1:54:45] after hour after hour
[1:54:53] i've heard preachers preach 20 minutes
[1:54:55] and it felt like two hours
[1:54:58] i've heard him preach two hours and it
[1:54:59] felt like 20 minutes
[1:55:02] because the word is eternal and when you
[1:55:05] go to breaking the word we slip into the
[1:55:07] eternal friends
[1:55:09] god is good things that are to be
[1:55:13] brother branham says but the other one
[1:55:15] is called my father's house i'll go and
[1:55:17] prepare a place for you
[1:55:18] take you out of this pest house and
[1:55:20] deliver you into my father's house amen
[1:55:22] there you are take you out of this old
[1:55:24] earthly pastels
[1:55:26] he's gone to prepare a place a perfect
[1:55:28] place where no evil exists
[1:55:30] no sickness exists no old age exists no
[1:55:32] death exists
[1:55:33] it's a perfect place calling you to that
[1:55:35] perfection and you have to be a perfect
[1:55:37] you have to be perfect to get there
[1:55:39] the bible said so jesus said be
[1:55:41] therefore perfect even as your father in
[1:55:42] heaven is perfect
[1:55:44] it is a perfect kingdom so it must be a
[1:55:45] perfect people come
[1:55:47] because you have to stand to be married
[1:55:49] to a perfect son of god
[1:55:51] and you must be a perfect bride this is
[1:55:54] tough
[1:55:54] friends who wants to try to do that
[1:55:58] give you your effort so how can you do
[1:56:02] it through anything else but the perfect
[1:56:04] word of god
[1:56:06] which is the waters of separation that
[1:56:09] washes
[1:56:10] us from our sins what is that water that
[1:56:13] washes us from our sins
[1:56:15] the word of god amen that's right
[1:56:18] the blood of jesus christ think of it
[1:56:21] the dripping
[1:56:22] bloody word
[1:56:26] amen the blood the word of god bleeding
[1:56:28] blood
[1:56:29] to wash the bride in he's going to wash
[1:56:33] her in the blood but what did he just
[1:56:34] say the blood was the blood was the word
[1:56:35] of god
[1:56:38] she stands perfect virgin unadulterated
[1:56:42] she never sent in the first place
[1:56:44] she was trapped into it there's the
[1:56:46] father's house that he's gone
[1:56:48] to prepare in the invisible union of the
[1:56:52] bride of christ he says what is sin sin
[1:56:54] is unbelief
[1:56:55] unbelief in what the word unbelief in
[1:56:58] god
[1:56:58] which is the word but unadulterated oh
[1:57:03] hallelujah leaving soon for the skies
[1:57:05] amen standing ready think your garments
[1:57:07] washed by the water
[1:57:09] of the bleeding word
[1:57:12] listen friends we are our garments are
[1:57:14] washed by the water of the bleeding
[1:57:17] word so that means in this
[1:57:20] day there must be a bleeding word there
[1:57:23] must be a fresh blood for a fresh
[1:57:25] application
[1:57:26] for a fresh cleansing there's got to be
[1:57:29] a blood that's flowing today
[1:57:31] it can't be a blood that flowed another
[1:57:33] day it's got to be a blood flowing today
[1:57:38] washed by the water of the bleeding word
[1:57:41] the word become
[1:57:42] blood the word bled for you
[1:57:45] and you are washed in bleeding word
[1:57:49] the word bleeding the life of god in the
[1:57:51] word and the word was bled for you
[1:57:54] that you might be washed from the filth
[1:57:55] of these prostitutes and be clean
[1:57:57] cleaned and sanctified by the washing of
[1:58:00] the water
[1:58:00] of the word and makes your mind and
[1:58:03] heart stayed on god
[1:58:04] and on his word so brother brenham is
[1:58:07] saying being washed in the bleeding
[1:58:08] bloody word
[1:58:09] is to be washed by the water of the word
[1:58:12] so to be washed by the water of the word
[1:58:14] is to be washed by the blood
[1:58:19] some people don't like that but i love
[1:58:22] it
[1:58:24] and i'll i'll tell you why in a minute
[1:58:28] because that's my atonement
[1:58:31] without an atonement i can bring a
[1:58:32] sacrifice but if i bring a sacrifice
[1:58:34] with no atonement it'll bring death like
[1:58:36] it did to cain
[1:58:38] but sacrifice with an atonement brings
[1:58:40] life
[1:58:42] and reconciliation back to god so if
[1:58:45] we're going to bring a sacrifice of
[1:58:46] praise if we're going to bring a
[1:58:47] sacrifice
[1:58:48] and offer to the lord we must bring a
[1:58:49] sacrifice with an atonement
[1:58:54] let's turn to ephesians chapter 5.
[1:59:03] in verse 25
[1:59:07] husbands love your wives even as christ
[1:59:09] also loved the church and gave himself
[1:59:11] for it that he might sanctify and
[1:59:12] cleanse it with the washing
[1:59:14] of water by the word so why is he gonna
[1:59:18] wash her
[1:59:18] with the water of the word what's the
[1:59:21] only thing that'll make her clean
[1:59:24] the word how can you bring
[1:59:27] purity with dirty water
[1:59:30] if the word has been polluted how can
[1:59:32] you get clean with polluted water
[1:59:35] if the word has been doctored altered
[1:59:37] things added things taken away
[1:59:40] now there's a corrupt perverted word how
[1:59:42] can you get clean by a corrupt perverted
[1:59:44] word
[1:59:44] you can't wash with dirty water
[1:59:48] so if he's going to have a pure bride
[1:59:50] he's got to first break a pure word
[1:59:52] so that a pure word can wash a bride
[1:59:54] pure
[1:59:55] because he cannot be united with
[1:59:57] anything that's not virgin
[1:59:58] clean pure holy
[2:00:02] no perversion so he sent the word so
[2:00:05] that we can be washed by the water of
[2:00:06] the word
[2:00:07] to wash away all the effects of the
[2:00:09] prostitute spirits through seven
[2:00:11] ages so that he could be united what was
[2:00:14] the washing of the water to do
[2:00:16] washing of the water of the word to do
[2:00:18] bring us back into union with god
[2:00:23] this prophet didn't come so we can say
[2:00:25] god sent a prophet
[2:00:28] the prophet came as the voice of god in
[2:00:31] the garden in the cool of the evening
[2:00:33] so that we would recognize the presence
[2:00:35] of god
[2:00:37] and in recognizing the presence of god
[2:00:39] we would realize we were naked
[2:00:42] and when realizing we were naked we'd
[2:00:43] come to god and god would judge us
[2:00:46] people are afraid of judgment by the
[2:00:48] word but i say i love judgment by the
[2:00:50] word
[2:00:51] because that judgment is the path to my
[2:00:52] reconciliation
[2:00:56] brings the judgment then in judgment he
[2:00:59] brings an atonement
[2:01:00] and brings a covering and brings a
[2:01:02] reconciliation
[2:01:04] so in this day god come down as a voice
[2:01:12] in the days of the voice of the seventh
[2:01:14] angel
[2:01:15] what was it it was the voice of god
[2:01:17] through that man
[2:01:19] it recognized so we could recognize the
[2:01:21] presence of god
[2:01:22] and the voice exposed the nakedness of
[2:01:25] creeds and denominations
[2:01:26] and fig leaves and under that nakedness
[2:01:30] then
[2:01:30] now he brings an atonement that will
[2:01:32] bring a fresh
[2:01:34] bleeding word a bleeding bloody word
[2:01:38] that'll be the washing of the water by
[2:01:41] the word to wash away
[2:01:43] all the wrong doctrine all the wrong
[2:01:46] understanding
[2:01:47] everything that got picked up through
[2:01:49] seven churches
[2:01:50] to wash it away so he could do what so
[2:01:53] he could unite with his bride
[2:01:57] amen god did not send the prophet so we
[2:02:00] could say god sent a prophet there was
[2:02:01] malachi 4
[2:02:02] and i'm happy about that god wanted a
[2:02:04] reconciliation with his attributes
[2:02:06] he wanted to become one with one flesh
[2:02:09] with his bride in the end time
[2:02:12] if we miss that we've missed the seventh
[2:02:14] seal if we've missed that
[2:02:15] we've missed the opening of the seals if
[2:02:17] we missed that we've missed the purpose
[2:02:19] of the coming of the forerunner what was
[2:02:21] he for running
[2:02:27] i want to stay with the forerunner but
[2:02:29] the forerunner was for running something
[2:02:31] catch what he four run step into what he
[2:02:34] four run
[2:02:34] become the seventh seal become the
[2:02:37] mystery unveiled
[2:02:38] which is a bride in the end time
[2:02:41] [Applause]
[2:02:43] the prophet came to unite the bride in
[2:02:46] christ together
[2:02:48] he come in an eleazar ministry amen to
[2:02:50] fetch a bride for isaac
[2:02:56] and how's he going to do it he's got to
[2:02:58] bring a water
[2:03:00] of separation that will cleanse
[2:03:07] and the feast of trumpets prophet of god
[2:03:10] said in revelations 11
[2:03:14] revelations 11 call their ministry will
[2:03:16] be the ministry of moses
[2:03:17] and elias calling to israel out of the
[2:03:20] jewish traditions
[2:03:22] just as the seventh angels message
[2:03:25] called the bride out of pentecostal
[2:03:26] tradition
[2:03:28] so he's running a parallel
[2:03:31] moses and elijah is to call israel out
[2:03:33] of the old atonement of the lamb
[2:03:35] and sheep and blood and goats and
[2:03:37] sacrifice to the real
[2:03:39] living sacrifice the word
[2:03:44] where is the living sacrifice today it's
[2:03:46] the word where's the atonement at in the
[2:03:48] word
[2:03:49] where's the bleeding word and the
[2:03:50] revelation of the word it's a fresh
[2:03:52] blood that's come to cleanse the bride
[2:03:57] to bring them to the real living
[2:03:59] sacrifice
[2:04:01] to the word and the seventh angel's
[2:04:03] message under the same trumpet same
[2:04:05] everything exactly the same seals to
[2:04:07] what call the people the bride
[2:04:09] out of the pentecostal and world
[2:04:10] tradition to the genuine atonement
[2:04:14] are you ready for this this is the
[2:04:17] prophet of god not brother chad
[2:04:22] to bring the bride call the bride out of
[2:04:24] the pentecostal world tradition
[2:04:26] to the genuine atonement the word
[2:04:31] what is our atonement this revealed word
[2:04:38] impersonated in his word here made flesh
[2:04:41] among us
[2:04:42] science has proved it by pictures the
[2:04:44] church knows it the world around
[2:04:46] we firmly know it for he's never told us
[2:04:48] one thing and thus saith the lord but
[2:04:49] what's been the truth
[2:04:50] did he not say down there in the river
[2:04:52] as john the baptist was sent so will
[2:04:54] this message
[2:05:02] i'm going to draw something because i
[2:05:04] like this board
[2:05:08] i don't have one of these at home
[2:05:16] i'm going to draw something and i just
[2:05:18] want you to pay close attention to what
[2:05:19] i'm saying and don't pass any judgment
[2:05:21] until you hear what we're saying
[2:05:31] all right going to call this
[2:05:34] old testament
[2:05:41] new testament
[2:05:48] and this line begins at the fall of eden
[2:05:52] i've got a quote for that we'll see in a
[2:05:54] minute
[2:05:55] and this line is the bloodline
[2:06:02] brother brendan calls it the scarlet
[2:06:04] thread
[2:06:08] we know that jesus
[2:06:12] was the lamb of god and he was the word
[2:06:16] made flesh
[2:06:18] and the word made flesh all the word was
[2:06:21] brought into flesh and that flesh was
[2:06:23] jesus christ
[2:06:24] and he come as a man and that man would
[2:06:27] live the perfect life fulfilled all the
[2:06:29] law
[2:06:29] so that he was worthy to be a sacrifice
[2:06:32] to fulfill all the ordinances of the law
[2:06:34] all the requirements and he died and he
[2:06:36] shed his blood
[2:06:37] to redeem us back to god and free us
[2:06:39] from the bondage of the law
[2:06:41] we understand that so we were redeemed
[2:06:45] at calvary with the shed blood
[2:06:48] of god's lamb
[2:06:52] but truthfully he was the lamb slain
[2:06:56] from before the foundation of the world
[2:07:00] so before the fallen eden
[2:07:04] he was already the lamb that was slain
[2:07:09] is that true
[2:07:13] so there's been a line of blood and this
[2:07:16] bloodline
[2:07:16] goes to calvary and from calvary into
[2:07:18] eternity
[2:07:22] adam comes here
[2:07:30] and now adam needs an atonement
[2:07:37] adam is here in time adam
[2:07:41] can't wait to get over here because that
[2:07:44] won't come for 4 000 years
[2:07:48] so what's adam going to do how is adam
[2:07:50] going to be atoned
[2:07:52] how is adam going to be saved in his day
[2:07:54] the only thing he can do is get a hold
[2:07:56] of this bloodline in his day
[2:07:58] and when he grabs a hold of that
[2:07:59] bloodline what is the bloodline
[2:08:01] the word for his day he got a hold of
[2:08:05] the word for his day
[2:08:06] and when he got a hold of the word for
[2:08:08] his day he grabbed a hold of that word
[2:08:10] and that's the bloodline amen because
[2:08:12] the life is in the blood it's the life
[2:08:14] of the word moving through
[2:08:18] then abel come along
[2:08:22] and abel couldn't wait to get over here
[2:08:25] amen for redemption
[2:08:26] abel had to do something in his day that
[2:08:29] would that would give him an atonement
[2:08:30] amen that would bring him to the
[2:08:31] redemption
[2:08:32] so the only thing he could do was
[2:08:34] believe god by faith for his day
[2:08:36] and when he believed the word for his
[2:08:37] day he got a hold of this lifeline amen
[2:08:40] because the bloodline is the lifeline
[2:08:43] it's the life of the word amen
[2:08:47] then come noah
[2:08:52] amen now noah can't go back and grab a
[2:08:56] hold where abel grabbed a hold of
[2:08:58] because the bloodline the life is moving
[2:09:00] on and as the life moves on
[2:09:02] god is revealing more and now noah can't
[2:09:05] just
[2:09:05] he can't just rely on salvation by the
[2:09:08] shedding of a lamb
[2:09:09] because there was another word that came
[2:09:11] for his day
[2:09:12] and the word that came for his day said
[2:09:15] i'm going to destroy all the earth
[2:09:17] but i've prepared an ark go and build
[2:09:19] the ark
[2:09:20] and all that come into this revealed
[2:09:22] word for the hour
[2:09:24] shall be saved from the destruction of
[2:09:26] the earth
[2:09:26] [Applause]
[2:09:30] noah noah was not contradicting abel
[2:09:35] noah was not against abel
[2:09:38] noah was not calling abel an unbeliever
[2:09:42] but noah couldn't just rely on what abel
[2:09:45] did
[2:09:45] when he was presented with the lifeline
[2:09:47] he had to get a hold of it
[2:09:56] then come moses
[2:09:59] do you ever hear brother bennett say
[2:10:00] moses couldn't come and say let's build
[2:10:02] an ark and float down the nile to escape
[2:10:04] this amen moses
[2:10:07] when moses come he had a different
[2:10:09] message because he was further down on
[2:10:11] the lifeline
[2:10:12] he was further down on the revelation of
[2:10:14] christ
[2:10:16] and the bible says of of moses
[2:10:19] he says moses
[2:10:22] forsook the treasures of egypt
[2:10:27] esteeming the reproach of christ
[2:10:31] that means there was a christ in moses
[2:10:33] day christ was alive
[2:10:36] christ was here amen how can he not bear
[2:10:40] the reproach of christ as there was no
[2:10:41] christ
[2:10:42] christ was there because christ is the
[2:10:44] anointed word and wherever the anointed
[2:10:46] word is
[2:10:47] it's christ
[2:10:51] i'll ask you a question who was that
[2:10:54] rock that followed them through the
[2:10:55] wilderness
[2:10:56] that rock was christ
[2:11:01] when they drank from the rock they were
[2:11:03] drinking from christ
[2:11:06] [Music]
[2:11:09] moses wasn't calling noah false
[2:11:13] unbeliever not a child of god
[2:11:16] but neither could he build an ark that
[2:11:19] was the word for a previous day
[2:11:21] but now in order to have salvation
[2:11:25] there was a fresh word
[2:11:28] fresh blood fresh life of christ
[2:11:32] that fresh life of christ in their day
[2:11:34] was the only path to salvation
[2:11:38] and they had to get a hold of the
[2:11:39] lifeline
[2:11:41] [Applause]
[2:11:44] when god slayed the lamb here
[2:11:47] he was foreshadowing a lamb here
[2:11:51] in time the lamb hadn't come yet
[2:11:54] but in god's mind the lamb had already
[2:11:57] been slain
[2:11:58] god already had blood in his mind he
[2:12:01] already had redemption in his mind
[2:12:03] he already knew what was going to happen
[2:12:05] that's why whenever you grab the hold of
[2:12:07] the word
[2:12:08] amen god accounted it to you for
[2:12:10] righteousness and you were declared
[2:12:12] righteous with god
[2:12:13] because that lamb was slain before the
[2:12:15] foundation of the world
[2:12:16] and you were holding on to the life of
[2:12:18] that lamb
[2:12:26] when moses came along and believed the
[2:12:28] word those who believed it with him were
[2:12:29] joshua and caleb what were they doing
[2:12:31] they were putting their hands on the
[2:12:32] head of that lamb
[2:12:35] identifying themselves with that lamb
[2:12:39] that lamb was not going to be slain for
[2:12:40] another 2000 years but they were placing
[2:12:42] their hands on the lamb
[2:12:44] and that lamb was going to bear their
[2:12:46] sins and that lamb was going to be a
[2:12:47] sacrifice for them
[2:12:49] but they were identifying with the lamb
[2:12:51] in their day
[2:12:54] [Applause]
[2:12:55] they come all the way down till we come
[2:12:59] to jesus christ
[2:13:08] jesus christ came what was he
[2:13:11] he was the word
[2:13:15] what was this in adam's day the word
[2:13:19] what was it in abel's day the word what
[2:13:22] was it noah's day
[2:13:24] the word moses day the word solomon's
[2:13:27] day
[2:13:27] the word jeremiah's day the word so now
[2:13:30] when the word was made flesh and dwelt
[2:13:32] along among us everything that they
[2:13:34] grabbed hold of was inside jesus christ
[2:13:37] their anchor point man their hand hold
[2:13:39] where they laid their hands it was now
[2:13:41] here in a body of flesh
[2:13:42] and when that flesh bled and died for
[2:13:44] them amen they were atoned for because
[2:13:46] they received him in their day
[2:13:49] so much so that the scripture says when
[2:13:51] jesus arose
[2:13:52] everybody attached to this line
[2:13:55] resurrected with him when he rose
[2:14:02] amen they weren't here they weren't here
[2:14:07] to believe that jesus christ was the son
[2:14:09] of god
[2:14:10] they weren't able to make their
[2:14:11] confession in the lamb that died on
[2:14:13] calvary
[2:14:14] they could only make their confession
[2:14:16] and the life of the lamb that was
[2:14:17] presented to them
[2:14:22] so when all that life all that word was
[2:14:25] bottled up
[2:14:26] all here everything they touched was in
[2:14:28] here
[2:14:29] everything they believed was in here
[2:14:30] amen when he died
[2:14:32] he died for them they were with him when
[2:14:34] he died
[2:14:35] they died with him they paid for their
[2:14:38] sins with the lamb
[2:14:39] because they identified with the lamb in
[2:14:42] their day
[2:14:44] amen this is the bible friend
[2:14:49] you can't argue with the bible
[2:14:54] [Music]
[2:14:57] when christ went up everybody attached
[2:14:59] to this line went up too
[2:15:03] including you
[2:15:08] because the apostle paul says and you
[2:15:10] are now seated in heavenly places in
[2:15:12] christ jesus when god ray
[2:15:14] when god raised him up when god raised
[2:15:16] him up when god raised him up he raised
[2:15:18] you up also
[2:15:20] when did you get raised up and go to
[2:15:22] glory when he raised up you raised up
[2:15:25] [Applause]
[2:15:31] it wasn't just this side of the line
[2:15:33] that went up when he went up
[2:15:34] this side of the line went up too
[2:15:38] [Applause]
[2:15:40] that's according to the apostle paul
[2:15:43] [Music]
[2:15:46] when he raised him up he raised you up
[2:15:49] also
[2:15:51] do you believe that
[2:15:52] [Applause]
[2:15:57] but god had one way to make sure that
[2:15:59] the promise would be attached to the
[2:16:00] seed
[2:16:02] he did it by grace which is his love but
[2:16:05] yet he's a just god
[2:16:06] and in order being a just god he can't
[2:16:08] come to the judgment day
[2:16:10] and somebody say i never had an
[2:16:12] opportunity you're not fair with me
[2:16:15] so god gave everybody a chance
[2:16:18] they all had a chance to hear the word
[2:16:20] they all had a chance to grab a hold of
[2:16:22] the lifeline
[2:16:23] it was presented in every day and every
[2:16:26] day the word was presented
[2:16:28] the life that was in the word was coming
[2:16:30] forth and every day they had an
[2:16:32] opportunity brother ben says you don't
[2:16:34] go to hell
[2:16:35] because you smoke because you drank
[2:16:37] because you committed adultery
[2:16:39] he said you go to hell because you
[2:16:40] refused the lights
[2:16:46] so when he went up i went up
[2:16:53] how do you know you're going on a
[2:16:54] rapture because i already went
[2:17:03] according to the bible i am now seated
[2:17:07] in heavenly places in christ jesus
[2:17:10] because i'm part of that word if that
[2:17:12] word is in me
[2:17:13] amen then that word is there i'm linked
[2:17:15] to the word there the word there in the
[2:17:17] word here
[2:17:18] is not two different things it's the
[2:17:19] word it's the same thing
[2:17:28] so now the apostle paul comes along
[2:17:34] the apostle paul comes down as a light
[2:17:36] and to the gentiles the apostle to the
[2:17:37] gentiles
[2:17:38] he's going to people who've never been
[2:17:39] in jerusalem may never go to jerusalem
[2:17:44] and he's telling them that they have to
[2:17:46] receive the gospel message
[2:17:50] but they can't go back here
[2:17:56] they can't go back when the scoffers are
[2:17:58] crying crucify him
[2:17:59] they can't go back and say i believe
[2:18:02] lord you're the lord
[2:18:03] they can't fall at his feet amen like
[2:18:05] the woman
[2:18:06] that did with the alabaster box they
[2:18:08] can't kiss his feet
[2:18:09] they can't get to him in his body of
[2:18:11] flesh because that manifestation has
[2:18:13] already moved on
[2:18:17] they can't go back and stand at the
[2:18:18] cross and say i believe it
[2:18:20] they can't go back and dip their fingers
[2:18:22] in the blood and apply it to themselves
[2:18:24] but yet they need an application of the
[2:18:26] blood
[2:18:30] everybody has to be atoned by the blood
[2:18:35] because a sacrifice without atonement
[2:18:37] brings death
[2:18:39] all of our worship without atonement and
[2:18:41] the bleeding bloody word will bring
[2:18:43] death
[2:18:44] but the worship with atonement brings
[2:18:46] life
[2:18:50] so the father has provided a sacrifice
[2:18:56] i can't go back and dip
[2:19:00] my finger in that blood and apply it
[2:19:04] so how do i get an application of the
[2:19:06] blood
[2:19:07] the same way they did back here
[2:19:10] [Music]
[2:19:12] [Applause]
[2:19:14] because the word is eternal he does not
[2:19:17] change in his purpose he does not change
[2:19:19] in his order
[2:19:20] he does not change in his
[2:19:21] characteristics
[2:19:25] paul was speaking to gentiles who
[2:19:27] couldn't go back
[2:19:28] and get that blood but yet they had to
[2:19:30] be covered in the blood
[2:19:32] they had to have a blood atonement they
[2:19:34] had to come in contact with a fresh
[2:19:36] bleeding word
[2:19:37] and paul was bringing them the gospel
[2:19:39] and by their faith in the gospel
[2:19:41] they could get a hold of that bloodline
[2:19:48] then we go into the church ages and we
[2:19:50] go to lucifer's
[2:19:51] lucifer luther sorry
[2:20:08] luther had a fresh word for his age
[2:20:12] that fresh word brought a fresh blood
[2:20:15] that word had a life in it the life in
[2:20:18] that word would bring in atonement
[2:20:21] and would bring acceptance by god
[2:20:25] is that what the prophet told us luther
[2:20:27] by
[2:20:28] coming to justification hey listen they
[2:20:31] weren't believing yet
[2:20:32] in the restoration of the gifts they
[2:20:34] weren't even believing yet and
[2:20:35] sanctification
[2:20:36] they didn't even live holy lives
[2:20:40] luther swore and smoke and and all of
[2:20:42] these other things right
[2:20:44] no holiness but he was only you were
[2:20:47] only required
[2:20:50] to grab a hold of the lifeline when it
[2:20:52] was presented to you in your day
[2:20:59] and the lutherans when the word came
[2:21:01] forth they
[2:21:02] recognized that's god and they got a
[2:21:04] hold of that
[2:21:08] now the wesleyans come along and they
[2:21:09] were further down on the lifeline
[2:21:13] and the wesleyans couldn't reject luther
[2:21:17] because the lutherans were sons of god
[2:21:20] they couldn't call them unbelievers do
[2:21:23] you see the pattern
[2:21:25] they couldn't reject them as children of
[2:21:27] god but neither could they stay in
[2:21:30] justification only
[2:21:33] they couldn't just accept what luther
[2:21:34] brought it was okay that day
[2:21:36] it's not okay this day now
[2:21:40] christ is presenting more of himself
[2:21:43] more of the word is being unfolded
[2:21:45] more of the life of the word and that
[2:21:47] word is a bleeding bloody word
[2:21:49] with a fresh atonement for their day and
[2:21:51] wesley's day
[2:21:52] and if they would grab a hold of that
[2:21:54] word amen they would get the atonement
[2:21:56] and they would be reconciled back to god
[2:22:02] then in the pentecostal revival
[2:22:05] you couldn't stay under wesley's word
[2:22:08] alone
[2:22:10] you had to accept it when you came
[2:22:13] listen when you came here
[2:22:15] you believed all of this
[2:22:19] when you came here you believed all of
[2:22:21] this
[2:22:23] when you came here you believed all of
[2:22:25] this
[2:22:25] [Music]
[2:22:31] because as christ is revealed those who
[2:22:34] were with him before the foundation of
[2:22:35] the world those who were with him when
[2:22:37] he was crucified
[2:22:38] they believe all of christ amen they
[2:22:40] accept it
[2:22:41] all
[2:22:42] [Music]
[2:22:45] but neither can i come here
[2:22:48] and only believe this
[2:22:55] because if i believe all of this
[2:22:58] but reject the bloodline in my day i
[2:23:02] have rejected christ i have turned
[2:23:04] god down i have let go of any
[2:23:07] opportunity at the lifeline
[2:23:14] till we come to the end then there's a
[2:23:17] bride
[2:23:20] under the message and christ is
[2:23:22] presenting himself in full glory
[2:23:25] the mighty god unveiled before us amen
[2:23:28] the unveiling of god
[2:23:29] christ amen as he's peeled back all the
[2:23:32] layers of the churches he's opened the
[2:23:34] seals
[2:23:34] revealed himself and now in order to get
[2:23:37] the benefit of this
[2:23:39] which took place in the mind of god
[2:23:41] before the foundation of the world
[2:23:42] you don't have to go back here you can
[2:23:44] go back to the mind of god
[2:23:47] and you can grab all of this and say i
[2:23:49] believe it all
[2:23:50] [Applause]
[2:23:57] [Applause]
[2:23:58] amen
[2:24:02] listen listen
[2:24:05] when the pharisees came to this point
[2:24:07] right here
[2:24:09] they believed all of this or so they
[2:24:12] thought
[2:24:16] they thought they believed it all they
[2:24:19] believed the law they believed the
[2:24:20] prophets they believed the psalms they
[2:24:22] believed
[2:24:23] they believed it all but jesus says if
[2:24:26] you believe moses you would believe me
[2:24:28] for moses spoke of me i am what moses
[2:24:32] said
[2:24:33] what moses was i am
[2:24:38] you know that rock that followed moses
[2:24:40] that's who i am
[2:24:42] you know that reproach that moses bore
[2:24:44] he bore my reproach
[2:24:50] see really when it comes truthfully down
[2:24:52] to it when they come here they thought
[2:24:54] they believed all of that
[2:24:55] but when they didn't believe this it
[2:24:57] showed they didn't believe that
[2:25:01] they only had an intellectual
[2:25:03] understanding through education that
[2:25:05] they've been trained in since they were
[2:25:07] children
[2:25:08] they were taught to say moses was right
[2:25:10] they were taught to say jeremiah was
[2:25:12] right
[2:25:12] they were taught to say we came out of
[2:25:14] babylon they were taught to say we're
[2:25:16] the children of god
[2:25:17] they were taught to say we're god's
[2:25:18] elect but it didn't mean they were
[2:25:20] because when they rejected present day
[2:25:22] word they rejected
[2:25:24] all the law all the prophets
[2:25:31] so when we come to this day there's
[2:25:34] people here
[2:25:36] and they say i believe all of this
[2:25:41] but if you don't believe this you don't
[2:25:43] believe that
[2:25:45] [Applause]
[2:25:47] because all of this is christ
[2:25:50] and all of this is christ and if you
[2:25:53] reject christ
[2:25:54] you reject christ
[2:25:56] [Applause]
[2:26:02] now do you see the message now
[2:26:05] you see the bleeding word now do you see
[2:26:08] the life that was in the word
[2:26:10] now can you get a hold of that life can
[2:26:12] you bring a sacrifice of worship with an
[2:26:14] atonement
[2:26:14] and will the atonement bring you a
[2:26:16] covering of the covering the dresswear
[2:26:18] the garment of the word and can you now
[2:26:21] be united with your husband
[2:26:24] amen this is the day
[2:26:36] if you reject this you reject this
[2:26:46] people will fight you on that
[2:26:50] but it's been that way in every age
[2:26:54] every age through the bible the plan of
[2:26:57] salvation was the word for that day
[2:27:00] the way of escape for pending judgment
[2:27:02] was always the word for that day
[2:27:05] it's never changed through god's bible
[2:27:07] because it hasn't changed in his mind
[2:27:13] praise god
[2:27:17] brother branham says in the message the
[2:27:19] god of this evil age
[2:27:21] said the word was from the beginning
[2:27:24] god's plan
[2:27:26] so what was god's plan from the
[2:27:27] beginning the word
[2:27:29] i thought you said a slain lamb a slain
[2:27:31] lamb's part of the word
[2:27:35] it's not separate from the word that's
[2:27:36] the word what's calvary the word
[2:27:39] what's the redemption by blood the word
[2:27:42] what's healing the word what's holiness
[2:27:44] the word
[2:27:44] what's what's justification in the word
[2:27:46] what's restoration in the gifts the word
[2:27:48] it's all the word we believe all the
[2:27:50] word
[2:27:53] you can't say i'll take this part of the
[2:27:56] word and this part of the word and this
[2:27:57] part of the word and that part of the
[2:27:59] word but the rest of it i won't take
[2:28:01] if you reject christ you reject christ
[2:28:12] the word was from the beginning god's
[2:28:13] plan
[2:28:15] but god revealed by revelation the very
[2:28:18] thing that he vindicated and punctuated
[2:28:20] that was right
[2:28:21] not religion not an altar
[2:28:27] not belonging to church not making
[2:28:29] sacrifice
[2:28:31] not being sincere but the revelation of
[2:28:34] the word of god
[2:28:35] that was god's plan from the beginning
[2:28:38] that's what saved abel and that's what
[2:28:40] saves you that's what saved no one as
[2:28:43] family that's what saved those who
[2:28:45] followed moses
[2:28:46] that's what saved them all was
[2:28:49] revelation of the word of god
[2:28:54] brother bam says in the message satan's
[2:28:55] eden the god of this world today the
[2:28:57] worship person in this world today is
[2:28:59] satan
[2:29:00] and the people are ignorant of
[2:29:02] worshiping satan but it's satan
[2:29:04] impersonating himself as the church
[2:29:09] not in the bar room not the tattoo
[2:29:12] parlor
[2:29:12] not the house of prostitution
[2:29:14] impersonating himself as the church
[2:29:21] they worship satan thinking they are
[2:29:22] worshiping god through the church but
[2:29:24] it's the way satan has done it
[2:29:26] so how has he done it listen to how
[2:29:28] satan's done it
[2:29:30] how has he duped the whole world into
[2:29:32] worshiping him as the church
[2:29:33] they think they're worshiping god
[2:29:35] through the church but they're
[2:29:36] worshipping satan
[2:29:38] and brother brown says look at how satan
[2:29:40] has done it
[2:29:43] oh you say but wait a minute we preached
[2:29:45] the word look back here at my text
[2:29:46] tonight see
[2:29:47] was satan was the one who preached the
[2:29:49] word to eve
[2:29:51] god i said it's that misconstruing that
[2:29:55] part of the scripture that applies to
[2:29:57] the day
[2:30:00] that's how that's how satan is
[2:30:02] worshipped as the church
[2:30:04] that's how satan is the worship person
[2:30:05] of this world is because he's
[2:30:07] misconstrued
[2:30:08] the part of the word that applies to
[2:30:10] today
[2:30:13] [Music]
[2:30:15] that's how he's done it
[2:30:18] it's the misconstruing that part of the
[2:30:20] scripture that applies to the day
[2:30:22] he'll let you know all jesus did was
[2:30:24] perfectly well
[2:30:26] he'll let you know all that moses did
[2:30:27] was perfectly well
[2:30:30] he'll let you believe what jesus did was
[2:30:33] perfectly wrong
[2:30:39] you can confess jesus believe in him
[2:30:41] down on the cross believing in being a
[2:30:42] son of god according to the prophet
[2:30:44] and still be worshiping satan and not
[2:30:46] know it
[2:30:49] because what has he done he's
[2:30:50] misconstrued that part of the word that
[2:30:52] applies today
[2:30:53] he'll let you know all that jesus did
[2:30:55] was perfectly well he'll let you know
[2:30:57] all that moses did was perfectly well
[2:31:00] but when you take that promise that they
[2:31:02] gave for this day
[2:31:07] then that was applied to another age
[2:31:12] moving the word out of place
[2:31:16] that's just all he has to do see is to
[2:31:18] get the people to believe it that way
[2:31:20] that's all you cannot take one word away
[2:31:24] from it or add one word to it but that's
[2:31:25] what he does
[2:31:30] the anointed ones at the end time the
[2:31:31] prophet says we notice moses never give
[2:31:34] them what was noah's time
[2:31:37] we'll build an ark now because that's
[2:31:38] the word you know noah built an ark one
[2:31:40] day
[2:31:41] no vultures was eating on that
[2:31:44] [Music]
[2:31:48] i'm glad he said it so i didn't have to
[2:31:53] i don't know if i'd have nerve enough to
[2:31:55] say it but brother branham said him
[2:31:59] that is a promised word notice for his
[2:32:01] message he had from god he had the
[2:32:03] genuine
[2:32:04] predestinated word of god for that hour
[2:32:06] neither did jesus serve and moses is
[2:32:08] left over
[2:32:09] moses had the word for that or but moses
[2:32:11] was a prophet
[2:32:12] here is god himself see he never served
[2:32:14] them moses is left over
[2:32:17] but just look at the vultures there and
[2:32:19] the organization was glutting over it we
[2:32:21] know we got moses we don't have to have
[2:32:23] you
[2:32:24] he said if you'd have known moses you
[2:32:25] would have known me because moses spake
[2:32:27] of me
[2:32:29] listen where the carcass is
[2:32:40] the eagles will gather eagles
[2:32:43] the fresh kill of the word
[2:32:49] the word that's raised up and fattened
[2:32:51] and been made manifest and give
[2:32:53] out to food for the children where are
[2:32:55] the eagles gathered
[2:32:56] wherever the fresh kill of the word is
[2:32:58] wherever the word is fresh
[2:33:00] and wherever the blood is flowing fresh
[2:33:02] not all been hit on the road months ago
[2:33:05] or weeks ago
[2:33:06] but a fresh kill what does a fresh kill
[2:33:08] have it has fresh blood
[2:33:14] amen it's the blood
[2:33:18] what was the blood god took all of this
[2:33:22] from here to here and he put it in one
[2:33:25] man
[2:33:27] and the life of all of this
[2:33:31] was in that man and the life was in the
[2:33:34] blood
[2:33:35] so that when the blood cell was broke
[2:33:37] the blood life could come out
[2:33:39] and that life that was down through
[2:33:41] these ages could atone for every one of
[2:33:44] us wherever we caught that life
[2:33:46] in our age and for us we catch the life
[2:33:50] right here
[2:33:57] this is why people want to say i just
[2:34:00] want to preach the cross
[2:34:03] i just want to preach the cross all i
[2:34:05] want to do is preach the cross
[2:34:07] brother the cross is in this word
[2:34:10] what moses brought is in this word
[2:34:12] noah's day is in this word
[2:34:14] justification is in this word
[2:34:16] sanctification is in this word
[2:34:18] the gifts of the spirit are in this word
[2:34:21] everything is in
[2:34:23] this word
[2:34:27] i just want to preach the cross i'll
[2:34:29] accept this but i'll reject this
[2:34:32] you've cut yourself off from the
[2:34:34] lifeline
[2:34:36] the very line that ties you to calvary
[2:34:41] brother chad how can you say that
[2:34:43] because this
[2:34:45] was there it was all
[2:34:48] bottled up there all that word was in
[2:34:51] him when he was nailed to the cross
[2:34:54] and so this word that's here alive today
[2:34:57] was already there
[2:34:58] so this word bled for me back there this
[2:35:01] word atoned for me that there
[2:35:03] this word i have here was nailed there
[2:35:06] crucified there
[2:35:07] bled for me there was my redemption
[2:35:10] there but i wasn't there
[2:35:12] i'm here so i have to grab it here
[2:35:17] to have the effect of what took place
[2:35:19] there
[2:35:21] [Applause]
[2:35:24] which is only the manifestation what
[2:35:26] took place in the mind of god before the
[2:35:28] foundation
[2:35:33] when did i receive the message 1999
[2:35:36] 2000 2000 no in the mind of god before
[2:35:39] the foundation
[2:35:40] of the world i was a message believer
[2:35:44] [Applause]
[2:35:48] i was here and i was here
[2:35:52] and i was here and i was here
[2:35:59] what the prophet said you are the word
[2:36:02] all the word was there he said he made
[2:36:05] me pay for my sins on calvary
[2:36:10] do you want to see it in the word let's
[2:36:13] go to colossians
[2:36:27] [Music]
[2:36:32] colossians 19 or colossians chapter 1
[2:36:36] verse 19 colossians chapter 1 verse 19.
[2:36:41] for it please the father that in him
[2:36:43] should all fullness dwell
[2:36:45] and having made peace through the blood
[2:36:47] of his cross by him to reconcile
[2:36:49] all things unto himself by him i say
[2:36:51] whether they be things in earth or
[2:36:53] things in heaven
[2:36:54] and you that were sometimes alienated so
[2:36:57] he's reconciling you too
[2:37:00] are you in this verse are you the you
[2:37:03] that paul's talking about
[2:37:05] because you have to find yourself in the
[2:37:06] word i'm right there
[2:37:10] and you that were sometimes alienated
[2:37:12] and enemies in your mind
[2:37:14] by wicked works yet now
[2:37:17] hath he reconciled in the body of his
[2:37:19] flesh through death
[2:37:21] see where it skips from verse 21 to 22.
[2:37:26] look at the end of verse 21 where it
[2:37:28] says reconciled
[2:37:29] is there a period there is there any
[2:37:32] punctuation
[2:37:34] so is that the end of the sentence
[2:37:36] what's the rest of the sentence
[2:37:38] the rest of the sentence is the next
[2:37:40] line you have to read it as one
[2:37:42] sentence and that one sentence said yet
[2:37:45] now hath he reconciled
[2:37:46] in the body of his flesh through death
[2:37:49] where were you you were
[2:37:50] in the body of his flesh
[2:37:54] that's where you were reconciled
[2:38:00] man broke the scripture into two but
[2:38:02] it's one sentence friend
[2:38:05] where was i reconciled not here i was
[2:38:08] reconciled there
[2:38:09] according to colossians
[2:38:11] [Music]
[2:38:13] that's what paul says that's why brother
[2:38:15] branham said i preached what paul
[2:38:17] preached
[2:38:19] people want to take a they want to say
[2:38:21] you say you were there he made you pay
[2:38:23] for your sins when you were there
[2:38:24] hey where did brother branham get that
[2:38:26] he got it from the apostle paul
[2:38:29] [Music]
[2:38:33] amen
[2:38:38] praise god
[2:38:43] you know
[2:38:47] people want to try to correct brother
[2:38:54] branham
[2:38:58] not here
[2:39:12] i love you all you just love me anyways
[2:39:31] people say i want to take the bible
[2:39:35] and i want to correct brother branham by
[2:39:37] the bible
[2:39:46] if you if you can correct brother
[2:39:48] branham if you can correct this message
[2:39:50] by the bible
[2:39:52] then why not get rid of the whole
[2:39:54] message
[2:40:00] what you're doing when you say i want to
[2:40:02] correct brother ben i want to correct
[2:40:04] the message by the bible
[2:40:05] what you're saying is my understanding
[2:40:07] of the bible is
[2:40:09] perfect
[2:40:12] look at the pride the pride
[2:40:16] that says the pride that would say i
[2:40:19] just
[2:40:20] want what the bible says they're not the
[2:40:22] message
[2:40:23] brother man said this message is christ
[2:40:25] this bible is christ
[2:40:26] there's an equal sign right here the
[2:40:29] message
[2:40:30] is christ the message is the bible
[2:40:39] [Applause]
[2:40:45] because if not if that's not the case
[2:40:48] the problem
[2:40:48] and i don't mean listen we're not
[2:40:50] understand we're not into foolishness
[2:40:52] says brother ben said seven thousand and
[2:40:54] seven hundred they're both correct
[2:40:56] brother bam said himself that was wrong
[2:40:58] he was a man
[2:40:59] we're not we're not trying to make every
[2:41:01] word he said divine but the message he
[2:41:03] brought is the word
[2:41:06] the message he brought is the word the
[2:41:08] bible
[2:41:09] is the word christ is the word god
[2:41:13] is the word the message is the word the
[2:41:15] message
[2:41:16] is christ the message is the bible it's
[2:41:18] all the same thing
[2:41:26] everything he taught come from here
[2:41:31] [Applause]
[2:41:33] every time brother ben is preaching he's
[2:41:35] preaching the bible
[2:41:40] because remember somebody said to him
[2:41:43] brother madam you don't know the bible
[2:41:45] very well
[2:41:47] you know what they were saying you don't
[2:41:49] have good
[2:41:50] intellectual training on the recitation
[2:41:53] of the bible
[2:41:55] sometimes you get characters reversed
[2:41:58] sometimes you get the numbers
[2:42:00] of people wrong sometimes you
[2:42:03] word it funny and don't say it exactly
[2:42:05] like the bible says
[2:42:06] it yeah
[2:42:09] and they're saying you don't know your
[2:42:10] bible very well but brother man said
[2:42:12] that may be true
[2:42:15] but i know the author
[2:42:21] what's he saying i know the one who
[2:42:24] wrote this
[2:42:26] and the one who wrote this is the one
[2:42:28] who revealed this
[2:42:31] it comes from the same source from the
[2:42:34] same mind amen
[2:42:36] it is the mind of god
[2:42:39] [Applause]
[2:42:45] so if we have to start
[2:42:50] correcting the message by the bible how
[2:42:54] many different men
[2:42:56] with different understanding of the
[2:42:58] bible would it take to give us the
[2:43:00] correct interpretation of the message
[2:43:02] you know we're going to wind up with 40
[2:43:05] 000 message denominations by everybody
[2:43:07] taking their mental understanding
[2:43:09] of the bible and trying to fix the
[2:43:11] message with their own mind
[2:43:12] you're going to have one denomination in
[2:43:14] the message after another after another
[2:43:16] because it's repeating the same process
[2:43:18] that caused the church ages
[2:43:19] we'll be coming into the mess
[2:43:25] there are things the prophet said that
[2:43:27] we haven't understood for decades
[2:43:32] but in a flash who opened the word
[2:43:35] and that that he taught is laying right
[2:43:37] there in the bible
[2:43:38] that he said there is right there and
[2:43:40] that's there and that's there
[2:43:43] [Applause]
[2:43:47] but you know what brother branham said
[2:43:48] sometimes he says things in such a way
[2:43:51] that'll cause them to stumble
[2:43:54] some to go away some to fall away you
[2:43:56] say well god thinking do a thing like
[2:43:58] that he has and he does yet
[2:44:02] why he made it by faith
[2:44:05] so that it could be by grace so the
[2:44:08] promise would be sure to the elect
[2:44:10] how does the elect get it by the grace
[2:44:12] of god what did the grace of god give
[2:44:14] you
[2:44:14] a seed a predestination in your soul
[2:44:17] that could say that's nothing but the
[2:44:18] truth brother adam
[2:44:21] so he made it by faith so that it could
[2:44:24] be by grace
[2:44:25] so the promise would be sure to the
[2:44:26] elect and so nobody else would get it
[2:44:31] because his grace was only for his elect
[2:44:35] so he had to have a way where he could
[2:44:37] be a just god
[2:44:38] and give everybody the same chance to
[2:44:40] grab a hold of the life life
[2:44:41] and if you grab ahold of the lifeline
[2:44:43] and don't let go you'll be safe and
[2:44:45] you'll come up in that resurrection
[2:44:46] but if you don't grab that lifeline then
[2:44:49] you weren't in my mind before the
[2:44:50] foundation of the world
[2:44:55] and now when god comes to the judgment
[2:44:57] he's just
[2:44:58] he's holy he's true because everybody
[2:45:01] had the same chance to grab the lifeline
[2:45:03] but god by grace knew there was going to
[2:45:05] be his seed in the earth
[2:45:07] that would see that living word in their
[2:45:09] day and say
[2:45:10] that's the truth that's nothing but the
[2:45:12] truth and they would get a hold of
[2:45:13] it
[2:45:14] [Applause]
[2:45:18] and that's why he made it by faith
[2:45:22] so that it could be by grace so the
[2:45:25] promise would be sure to the election
[2:45:30] i remember hearing for years brother
[2:45:31] banham say
[2:45:33] when he was on the cross i was in him
[2:45:36] i'd say okay i don't understand it
[2:45:40] i don't see how it works and one day i'm
[2:45:43] reading through colossians
[2:45:45] and the spirit of god says there's no
[2:45:48] period
[2:45:52] there's no period those aren't two
[2:45:54] different sentences
[2:45:55] that's one sentence he has reconciled
[2:45:58] you
[2:45:59] in the body of his flesh through death
[2:46:04] [Applause]
[2:46:08] now if i had taken the doctrine that i
[2:46:11] have to fix
[2:46:11] this with this
[2:46:15] would i have already rejected what now i
[2:46:17] found out to be true
[2:46:20] how many things would we have rejected
[2:46:22] because we didn't see them yet
[2:46:24] in the bible it doesn't mean it wasn't
[2:46:27] in the bible
[2:46:29] but we didn't see them yet because it's
[2:46:32] taking a while to wash away our
[2:46:34] denominational
[2:46:35] understanding of the bible
[2:46:40] and as he's peeling back layer by layer
[2:46:43] all of a sudden you're saying there it
[2:46:45] is there it is there it is
[2:46:46] there it is where's the seventh seal the
[2:46:49] seventh seal was all the way back
[2:46:50] revealed already in genesis when god
[2:46:52] took a man
[2:46:53] pulled a woman out of a man united the
[2:46:56] two together
[2:46:56] that what was that that was his
[2:46:58] masterpiece what's his masterpiece his
[2:47:00] heart purpose
[2:47:01] what's his heart purpose the seventh
[2:47:03] seal
[2:47:05] where do you see the seventh seal in the
[2:47:07] bible i see it from genesis to
[2:47:08] revelation
[2:47:11] i see it in sarah
[2:47:14] i see it in ruth i see a nestor
[2:47:20] what's the seventh seal christ male and
[2:47:23] female
[2:47:23] united back together as one the oneness
[2:47:26] of god
[2:47:33] i'm so glad we don't have to correct the
[2:47:35] message with our feeble
[2:47:37] miniscule tiny carnal understanding
[2:47:41] of the bible
[2:47:44] but we can just take what he said look
[2:47:47] at the vindication
[2:47:48] and our hearts tell us that's the
[2:47:50] prophet of god
[2:47:57] to us it's a fresh bleeding word for
[2:48:00] this day
[2:48:02] to us it's the fresh kill of the world
[2:48:05] and the eagles have gathered
[2:48:07] to the carcass let's turn to job 39
[2:48:14] i just want to point out that that
[2:48:16] scripture
[2:48:17] where the carcasses the eagles will be
[2:48:19] gathered
[2:48:21] is a resurrection scripture
[2:48:24] because it comes from luke 17 and in
[2:48:26] luke 17 he said two will be in the field
[2:48:28] one will be taken
[2:48:29] two will be laying in the bed and the
[2:48:30] disciple says where will they be taken
[2:48:32] and he says where the carcass is there
[2:48:35] will the eagles be gathered
[2:48:36] and brother branham attached that
[2:48:38] scripture to his day
[2:48:40] meaning this is the resurrection day
[2:48:42] this is the resurrection system we've
[2:48:44] been resurrected out of dead
[2:48:45] denominationalism and brought
[2:48:47] quicken to newness of life it's a
[2:48:50] resurrection scripture so it's for today
[2:48:56] amen job 39
[2:48:59] this is where jesus is quoting from
[2:49:04] job 39 verse 27
[2:49:08] that the eagle mount up at thy command
[2:49:12] and make her nest on high
[2:49:14] now he's talking about eagles
[2:49:17] she dwelleth and abideth on the rock
[2:49:19] upon the crag of the rock in the strong
[2:49:21] place
[2:49:22] from thence she seeketh the prey in her
[2:49:24] eyes behold afar off
[2:49:26] and her young ones also suck up
[2:49:29] the blood
[2:49:34] and where the slain are there is she
[2:49:39] where are these young eagles mother
[2:49:41] eagle's been flying over the barnyard
[2:49:44] screaming come up hither come up hither
[2:49:46] and the eagles have taken flight
[2:49:48] where did they go they went to the fresh
[2:49:50] carcass what are they doing they're
[2:49:52] sucking up the fresh blood
[2:49:54] of atonement that's washing and cleaning
[2:49:56] and purifying them
[2:49:59] this is the bleeding bloody word of god
[2:50:08] and the anointed ones at the end time he
[2:50:10] says now i want you to know this is sure
[2:50:12] and you that listen to this tape you
[2:50:13] might have thought today that i was
[2:50:15] trying to say that about myself
[2:50:17] being that i was packing this message i
[2:50:19] have no more to do with it than nothing
[2:50:21] no more than just a voice
[2:50:23] and my voice even against my better
[2:50:25] judgment i wanted to be a trapper
[2:50:29] but that's the will of my father that i
[2:50:31] cleared declared to do and i determined
[2:50:33] to do
[2:50:34] i wasn't the one that appeared down in
[2:50:35] the river
[2:50:37] i was only standing there when he
[2:50:38] appeared
[2:50:40] i'm not the one that performs these
[2:50:41] things and foretells these things that
[2:50:43] happens as perfect
[2:50:44] they are i'm only one that's near when
[2:50:46] he does it
[2:50:48] i was only a voice that he used to say
[2:50:49] it i wasn't what it wasn't what i knew
[2:50:51] it's what i just surrendered myself to
[2:50:53] that he spoke through
[2:50:55] it isn't me it wasn't the seventh angel
[2:50:57] oh no it was the manifestation of the
[2:50:59] son of man
[2:51:01] it was the angel his message it was the
[2:51:04] mystery that god unfolded
[2:51:05] it's not a man it's god the angel was
[2:51:09] not the son of man he was the messenger
[2:51:11] from the son of man
[2:51:12] the son of man is christ he's the one
[2:51:15] you're feeding on
[2:51:17] [Applause]
[2:51:20] where are the eagles gathered fresh kill
[2:51:23] of the word
[2:51:25] he's the one you're feeding on you're
[2:51:27] not feeding on a man a man his words
[2:51:29] will fail
[2:51:30] you're feeding on the unfailing body
[2:51:32] word of the son of man
[2:51:35] if you haven't fed fully on every word
[2:51:37] to give yourself strength to fly above
[2:51:39] all these denominations and things of
[2:51:41] the world
[2:51:41] will you at this time do it while we
[2:51:44] pray
[2:51:46] hallelujah amen
[2:51:50] brother branham says god always has
[2:51:53] provided a way of escape for those
[2:51:55] who want to escape
[2:51:58] and every generation in every age of the
[2:52:00] bible he's provided a way of escape for
[2:52:03] those who want to escape
[2:52:05] but what was that way of escape the
[2:52:07] fresh word for their day
[2:52:10] the word of god coming forth in third
[2:52:12] day the word may manifest in their day
[2:52:16] let's go to second thessalonians
[2:52:19] chapter 2.
[2:52:30] second thessalonians chapter 2
[2:52:38] verse 7 for the mystery of iniquity doth
[2:52:42] already work only who now letteth will
[2:52:44] let until he be taken out of the way
[2:52:47] and then shall that wicked be revealed
[2:52:48] whom the lord shall consume with the
[2:52:49] spirit of his mouth and shall destroy
[2:52:51] with the brightness of his coming
[2:52:53] even him whose coming is after the
[2:52:55] working of satan with all power and
[2:52:56] signs and lying wonders
[2:52:58] and with all deceivableness of
[2:53:00] unrighteousness in them that perish
[2:53:02] because they receive not the love of the
[2:53:04] truth
[2:53:06] why did they perish they didn't receive
[2:53:08] the love of the truth
[2:53:10] it wasn't that they didn't have the
[2:53:11] truth
[2:53:13] they didn't love it
[2:53:17] they had not received the love of the
[2:53:18] truth that they might be saved
[2:53:20] they would be saved by love of the truth
[2:53:25] and for this cause god shall send them
[2:53:27] strong delusion that they should believe
[2:53:28] a lie
[2:53:30] that they all might be damned who
[2:53:32] believe not the truth but had pleasure
[2:53:34] and unrighteousness
[2:53:35] but we are bound to give thanks always
[2:53:37] to god for you brethren
[2:53:39] beloved of the lord because god hath
[2:53:41] from the beginning
[2:53:43] chosen you to salvation
[2:53:47] through sanctification of the spirit and
[2:53:49] belief
[2:53:50] of the truth
[2:53:56] from the beginning he hath chosen you
[2:53:59] through sanctification of the spirit and
[2:54:02] belief of the truth your salvation is
[2:54:05] resting on believing the truth
[2:54:07] he had that plan from the beginning
[2:54:09] that's why brother branham said
[2:54:11] it was from the beginning the word that
[2:54:13] was god's plan
[2:54:17] brother bran is not just saying things
[2:54:19] he just says it and doesn't give the
[2:54:21] bible reference but everything he's
[2:54:22] saying is the bible
[2:54:27] if you allow the eye salve of the
[2:54:29] message to come
[2:54:31] by believing the prophet for this age
[2:54:33] that i sav will come and get rubbed in
[2:54:35] your eyes
[2:54:35] and when you go back and look at the
[2:54:37] bible you'll say that's what it was
[2:54:38] there it was all alone
[2:54:40] i've read that scripture 20 30 40 50
[2:54:42] times
[2:54:43] but now i see
[2:54:45] [Music]
[2:54:46] that's exactly what he said
[2:54:50] so he has chosen you my brethren from
[2:54:52] the beginning
[2:54:54] he has chosen you under salvation
[2:54:57] through sanctification of spirit and
[2:55:01] belief of the truth
[2:55:06] what truth the truth that's presented in
[2:55:09] your age
[2:55:12] that's the way it's always been you
[2:55:13] can't change the bible
[2:55:16] you can't rewrite it friends
[2:55:23] brother braham said in
[2:55:26] recognition future home look how all
[2:55:29] kinds of forms those pharisees had
[2:55:32] but the word was made manifest they
[2:55:34] didn't recognize it see
[2:55:36] and if you are the bride the brightest
[2:55:38] part of the husband and the only place
[2:55:39] that you'll ever recognize it is
[2:55:40] recognize what part of that husband
[2:55:43] the word you are
[2:55:47] are we at the feet no
[2:55:51] are we at the legs the arms
[2:55:54] the eyes we've come to the full headship
[2:55:57] to the mind
[2:55:59] what part of the husband are you we've
[2:56:01] been given back the mind of christ when
[2:56:03] we've been given back the word
[2:56:11] you have to recognize what part of the
[2:56:12] husband the word you are you
[2:56:14] can't recognize being the bride how many
[2:56:16] sees that
[2:56:17] you have to recognize your position you
[2:56:20] can't recognize somebody else's
[2:56:23] what if moses would have come with
[2:56:24] noah's message no was part of it
[2:56:26] but it wouldn't have worked jesus would
[2:56:28] have come with moses message it wouldn't
[2:56:30] have worked see it was a different age
[2:56:31] it was a different prophecy a different
[2:56:33] part of the word
[2:56:34] had to be fulfilled there they was in
[2:56:36] another day of the week
[2:56:38] not tuesday's work can't be done on
[2:56:39] wednesday and wednesday has got to be
[2:56:41] done on
[2:56:41] wednesday saturday has to be saturday's
[2:56:43] work see
[2:56:45] and they was recognized oh moses we have
[2:56:47] moses he said if you'd know moses you'd
[2:56:49] have known me
[2:56:51] the lord your god shall raise a prophet
[2:56:53] like unto me god
[2:56:54] get the idea oh my see
[2:56:58] he said in recognizing your day in its
[2:56:59] message that the reason people in noah's
[2:57:01] day did not get into the ark
[2:57:03] because they never recognized the
[2:57:05] message nor the messenger
[2:57:08] that's the only reason they perished is
[2:57:11] because they didn't recognize the hour
[2:57:13] that they were living
[2:57:15] the door was open whoever wanted to
[2:57:17] could go in that door
[2:57:20] but they did not recognize the hour
[2:57:24] or the message
[2:57:27] brother bram says in the message in
[2:57:28] absolute
[2:57:31] i don't make any difference what others
[2:57:32] want to believe to the individual you
[2:57:35] are tied to it
[2:57:38] that's your ultimate brother ben and
[2:57:39] pat's bible that's your ultimate
[2:57:42] that's the last word and then if he is
[2:57:44] the word
[2:57:45] then this must be the last word this
[2:57:48] must settle it
[2:57:49] whatever that says that's the scarlet
[2:57:51] thread
[2:57:52] that is christ what the word
[2:57:56] and anything contrary to that i don't
[2:57:58] know nothing about it
[2:58:00] that's what we want to know is what this
[2:58:02] word says for i am tied to christ
[2:58:04] and christ is the word
[2:58:08] you get it now and the portion of this
[2:58:11] word that's lotted for this day
[2:58:13] his holy spirit is here to manifest that
[2:58:15] portion of the word
[2:58:17] just like it was back there at his birth
[2:58:19] isaiah 9 6
[2:58:20] all down through the scriptures
[2:58:22] everything was spoke of him it was
[2:58:23] fulfilled
[2:58:24] over in the book of luke we see that he
[2:58:26] was the end
[2:58:28] he was the end of the prophecy too of
[2:58:29] him he fulfilled that the history the
[2:58:31] songs
[2:58:32] everything in the old testament that
[2:58:33] spoke of him it was fulfilled right
[2:58:35] there
[2:58:36] that become the ultimate that become the
[2:58:38] thai post of the word for that age
[2:58:40] and the real born-again people of this
[2:58:42] age that's filled with the holy spirit
[2:58:43] is
[2:58:44] the thai post of this scripture that's
[2:58:46] got to be fulfilled in these last days
[2:58:49] they are the ultimate it's god's
[2:58:52] ultimate because
[2:58:53] it's his word and the word is christ
[2:58:56] the thai post
[2:59:00] further down in the same message he says
[2:59:02] i can see eternity break
[2:59:04] come down into time since eden
[2:59:10] he said i can see eternity break and
[2:59:12] come down into time in eden
[2:59:14] so in eden eternity broke and come down
[2:59:16] into time
[2:59:18] and when it did there come a line of
[2:59:20] blood
[2:59:22] all the way up to calvary and from
[2:59:24] calvary
[2:59:26] tied with this line and all goes to the
[2:59:29] thai post
[2:59:30] jesus and someday when he comes to claim
[2:59:33] his own
[2:59:34] everyone that's tied to that ultimate
[2:59:36] will be raised into eternity
[2:59:39] why they have they have been in eternity
[2:59:42] all the time they were predestinated in
[2:59:44] eternity they were part of god
[2:59:46] they were in his thinking at the
[2:59:47] beginning and when that big rope is
[2:59:49] pulled of the line of blood
[2:59:51] that token was speaking of when it comes
[2:59:53] up from the earth
[2:59:54] everyone that was included in that blood
[2:59:56] will be dropped right up into eternity
[2:59:58] again
[2:59:59] but the only way it will be will be tied
[3:00:02] to the absolute
[3:00:03] jesus christ
[3:00:07] that bloodline's been coming since
[3:00:09] eternity broke into time and eden been
[3:00:10] coming all the way to calvary and beyond
[3:00:15] and you have to be tied to that
[3:00:17] bloodline
[3:00:19] how do i get tied to that bloodline by
[3:00:22] receiving christ in my day
[3:00:31] brother ben said in the easter seal
[3:00:35] he said his messianic anointed ones
[3:00:38] believe that
[3:00:40] what is the messiah what is the messiah
[3:00:42] messiah's anointed one
[3:00:44] and now if he was the messiah by being
[3:00:46] the anointed one for that day to fulfill
[3:00:47] the word of god to be the redeemer and
[3:00:49] the anointed one
[3:00:50] and god raised up that body his bride is
[3:00:53] the anointed one for this day
[3:00:57] it's already raised with him in the
[3:00:59] resurrection because these two
[3:01:00] are one
[3:01:09] see the father
[3:01:14] the ministry of the father is a ministry
[3:01:17] of reconciliation back to fellowship
[3:01:22] now if we want to be a good father we
[3:01:24] have to be about reconciliation back to
[3:01:27] fellas
[3:01:30] could he fellowship with unbelief no he
[3:01:31] had to judge it but when he judged it he
[3:01:33] brought an atonement
[3:01:35] the atonement provided a covering and
[3:01:37] the covering brought them back into
[3:01:38] fellowship
[3:01:40] because now their sins were covered
[3:01:43] and now in this day the father is still
[3:01:46] has a ministry of reconciliation
[3:01:50] he's still a good father he's provided
[3:01:53] a bleeding word for this day a fresh
[3:01:56] kill of the word
[3:01:57] why has he provided a fresh word for
[3:02:00] this day
[3:02:01] because he wants reconciliation
[3:02:05] why did he offer a fresh word in
[3:02:06] luther's day for reconciliation
[3:02:09] for an atonement in reconciliation why
[3:02:10] did he offer a fresh word in wesley's
[3:02:12] day
[3:02:12] same pentecost but in this day he's
[3:02:15] brought a fresh
[3:02:16] word a fresh bleeding word amen the life
[3:02:19] of the word is here amen to bring a
[3:02:21] cleansing to bring an atonement
[3:02:23] to bring a reconciliation and now
[3:02:30] revelation
[3:02:30] 22 17 said in the spirit and the bride
[3:02:33] say come
[3:02:35] why because she's the anointed one for
[3:02:37] this day
[3:02:39] continuing the ministry of christ and
[3:02:41] christ had the ministry of the father
[3:02:43] and what was the ministry of christ to
[3:02:45] seek and find
[3:02:46] all the lost sheep and bring them back
[3:02:49] to the father's fold
[3:02:51] what was his ministry it was the
[3:02:52] ministry of the father i am about my
[3:02:55] father's business i do all the father's
[3:02:57] works
[3:02:57] he was here in the ministry of
[3:02:59] reconciliation to reconcile them back to
[3:03:02] god
[3:03:07] and brother branham said the ministry of
[3:03:09] christ and the ministry of the bride
[3:03:11] is the same ministry
[3:03:15] so what is the ministry it's the
[3:03:17] ministry of reconciliation
[3:03:20] and the spirit and the bride and the
[3:03:22] prophet will be saying the same thing
[3:03:25] and what they will be saying will have
[3:03:27] already been said in the word
[3:03:28] come out from among them my people and
[3:03:30] be separate
[3:03:32] separate from the worldly separate from
[3:03:35] the nomination
[3:03:36] separate and come be united with christ
[3:03:39] there's a fresh
[3:03:40] bleeding word here today
[3:03:45] has he called us to be kings and priests
[3:03:50] is that later is that now he said
[3:03:54] now we have a spiritual kingdom
[3:03:56] spiritual priesthood
[3:03:59] there will be in the millennium but he
[3:04:00] said now it's spiritual
[3:04:05] every priesthood has an order
[3:04:09] when god started it it was the order of
[3:04:11] the aaronic priesthood
[3:04:13] aaron and the sons then after everything
[3:04:16] got mixed up through babylon it became
[3:04:18] the levitical priesthood
[3:04:21] but now god has restored the melchizedek
[3:04:25] priesthood
[3:04:27] now brother branham he said who
[3:04:30] is this melchizedek the high priest is
[3:04:34] here
[3:04:34] the priesthood has been restored and if
[3:04:36] you're going to be a priest you have to
[3:04:38] be in the priesthood
[3:04:40] under the head of the priesthood which
[3:04:42] is the high priest and our high priest
[3:04:43] is melchizedek
[3:04:44] and we're part of the melchizedek
[3:04:46] priesthood
[3:04:48] which is an eternal priesthood
[3:04:52] and every priest had to have blood
[3:04:59] the aaronic priesthood had blood the
[3:05:04] levitical priesthood had blood
[3:05:06] but because every priest had blood jesus
[3:05:09] could not carry beyond the eternal
[3:05:11] realms
[3:05:11] the blood of bulls and goats all he
[3:05:13] could carry was his own blood
[3:05:15] his own life that had been given and he
[3:05:17] carried his own blood amen
[3:05:20] so that the life that was in the blood
[3:05:22] can come back to the believers
[3:05:24] so that they can be restored to a
[3:05:25] melchizedek priesthood not without blood
[3:05:28] but now they have the life of the blood
[3:05:30] in their vessel
[3:05:32] [Applause]
[3:05:34] we're walking through this life with the
[3:05:37] blood
[3:05:39] we have the restored word we have the
[3:05:41] bleeding word we
[3:05:42] have the life of the blood the life that
[3:05:46] was in the blood
[3:05:47] the life that went out at the shedding
[3:05:49] of the blood and that life went to cat
[3:05:51] with
[3:05:52] went to beyond a tabernacle built with
[3:05:55] man it went to the tabernacles in heaven
[3:05:57] to atone for us all
[3:05:59] to send the life back down
[3:06:03] so that now we could carry the blood
[3:06:06] and we have a spiritual priesthood and
[3:06:09] the spirit and the bride are saying
[3:06:11] come there's a blood that can atone for
[3:06:14] you
[3:06:15] there's a blood that can sanctify you
[3:06:17] that can wash you there's a bleeding
[3:06:19] bloody word that's been given in this
[3:06:20] day
[3:06:21] and you'll come to this in a lifeline
[3:06:23] and grab ahold you can be saved just as
[3:06:25] they were saved and noah's day
[3:06:27] moses day the day that calvary when
[3:06:29] jesus was slight
[3:06:30] you can be just as saved if you'll come
[3:06:32] to this lifeline
[3:06:36] now the bride is the anointed one for
[3:06:38] this day
[3:06:40] she has the priesthood under the order
[3:06:43] of melchizedek
[3:06:45] she has the life of the blood inside of
[3:06:47] her
[3:06:49] and now the spirit in her is calling out
[3:06:51] come
[3:06:53] come drink of the water of life
[3:06:59] all who are thirsty come
[3:07:04] let's look at second corinthians
[3:07:07] chapter five
[3:07:18] 2 corinthians chapter 5 verse 18.
[3:07:24] and all things are of god who hath
[3:07:26] reconciled us to himself by jesus christ
[3:07:29] and hath given to us the ministry
[3:07:33] of reconciliation the same ministry the
[3:07:37] father had in the garden
[3:07:39] is the same ministry going on by the
[3:07:41] same tools
[3:07:43] the same tools he used there was the
[3:07:44] blood of an innocent one and a covering
[3:07:47] the same tools he's using here was the
[3:07:48] blood of an innocent one and a covering
[3:07:52] now paul is saying that ministry of
[3:07:54] reconciliation has been committed to us
[3:07:58] now then we are ambassadors for christ
[3:08:03] what's he saying an ambassador is
[3:08:04] somebody who goes to a foreign land
[3:08:06] and represents the home country
[3:08:09] and we are here ambassadors for christ
[3:08:13] well i just want christ but i'm here
[3:08:14] representing him
[3:08:19] the amen is the anointed one for this
[3:08:21] day
[3:08:23] we are ambassadors for christ
[3:08:30] but now we are ambassadors for christ as
[3:08:33] though god did beseech you
[3:08:38] by us
[3:08:44] i want to hear from god paul was saying
[3:08:48] this is the same thing as god speaking
[3:08:50] to you
[3:08:52] we are ambassadors we are ambassadors of
[3:08:54] christ as
[3:08:55] though god did beseech you by us
[3:08:59] it's god calling to you it's god
[3:09:01] beseeching you
[3:09:02] we are ambassadors on behalf of christ
[3:09:04] and as though
[3:09:05] god did beseech you by us
[3:09:13] where is the word in this day what part
[3:09:15] of the body have we come to what is the
[3:09:17] manifestation
[3:09:19] where is the blood where is the life
[3:09:27] as though let's read it again now then
[3:09:30] we are ambassadors for christ as though
[3:09:32] god did beseech you by us
[3:09:34] we pray you in christ stead
[3:09:37] in the place of christ we are standing
[3:09:41] in the place of christ under a
[3:09:42] melchizedek priesthood
[3:09:45] and we pray you in christ's stead
[3:09:49] be reconciled to god
[3:09:53] this is the ministry of the father which
[3:09:56] became the ministry of christ
[3:09:57] which is now the ministry of the bride
[3:10:01] happy father's day
[3:10:04] god is reconciling his children
[3:10:07] back to himself through an atonement
[3:10:12] [Applause]
[3:10:17] through an atonement and he's provided a
[3:10:20] covering
[3:10:22] the prophet said let this be the
[3:10:24] crowning of my ministry
[3:10:26] the pride to provide the clothes for the
[3:10:28] bride
[3:10:29] that she might be dressed in the word
[3:10:33] god has brought an atonement in our day
[3:10:37] a bleeding word the life
[3:10:41] that's been in this lifeline the
[3:10:42] bloodline is here
[3:10:45] where is it i don't see it i'm looking
[3:10:47] at it
[3:10:49] that life is contained in earthen
[3:10:51] vessels
[3:10:53] it's not the vessel it's the life inside
[3:10:55] the vest
[3:10:58] it's not my brother my sister it's
[3:10:59] christ that's inside
[3:11:04] there's a priesthood here in flesh
[3:11:07] standing as ambassadors of christ
[3:11:11] saying as though god did beseech you
[3:11:14] by us and now we say
[3:11:17] in christ's dead if you want god
[3:11:21] if you want christ listen what i'm
[3:11:24] saying
[3:11:24] this is his voice because she will be
[3:11:28] the final voice
[3:11:29] and the final day
[3:11:33] what is she saying what's been said
[3:11:35] before
[3:11:37] in that message in the word of god
[3:11:41] god bless you let's all stand
[3:11:50] [Applause]
[3:11:53] let's just pray oh mighty god we love
[3:11:57] you lord
[3:11:59] we thank you father for this opportunity
[3:12:01] to be here
[3:12:02] to hear things lord that apostles and
[3:12:05] prophets and men of old have longed to
[3:12:07] hear
[3:12:08] god i don't think we could humble
[3:12:10] ourselves enough i don't think we can be
[3:12:12] humble enough or sincere enough to ever
[3:12:14] grab the gravity of what is going on in
[3:12:16] this day
[3:12:18] open our eyes give us a fresh dose of
[3:12:20] the eyes to have
[3:12:22] so that we can come with sincerity and
[3:12:24] earnestness to the day we're living in
[3:12:26] not laughing and joking and half-hearted
[3:12:28] but may we give our whole selves to this
[3:12:30] ministry of reconciliation
[3:12:32] may we recognize our position when we
[3:12:35] recognize our position as kings and
[3:12:37] priests on this earth
