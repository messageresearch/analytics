[0:00] you can't understand it
[0:02] that you believe it anyhow
[0:05] if I could understand God I wouldn't
[0:07] have to believe God I do not understand
[0:09] God no man understands God I cannot
[0:13] understand the word of God
[0:16] except this is
[0:22] I don't spend to know seminarian all
[0:24] this great understanding of man's
[0:26] knowledge on that honestly the Bible
[0:29] says that Jesus Christ is the same
[0:30] yesterday and forever and I'll look for
[0:32] him in that same category
[0:34] I know he promised what he would do in
[0:36] this day uh look for him to do it and he
[0:38] doesn't
[0:39] right he promised Grace uh look for it
[0:42] and I received it he promised healing I
[0:44] believe
[0:45] and I accepted it and I receive it now
[0:49] don't take too much of your time
[0:52] but I want to ask one thing if you'll
[0:54] bear with me a minute to consider some
[0:57] of those who did not leave on their own
[0:59] understanding some characters of The
[1:02] Bible just for abuse
[1:05] that lean not to their own understanding
[1:07] regardless of what the understanding of
[1:09] their age was let's take for instance
[1:11] Noah Noah lived in a
[1:16] day research
[1:18] the days of Noah they probably built the
[1:20] Pyrenees that they cannot reproduce

[26:06] for
[26:07] the testimonies and then um
[26:10] the offering and then the tithes amen
[26:15] praise the Lord
[26:18] I want to give this testimony for the
[26:21] glory of God
[26:23] and for the edification of the church
[26:26] I've been having some health problems
[26:29] for a long time
[26:31] that is from since
[26:33] 2014 even before that
[26:36] I'll start with one because there are
[26:38] three I'm going to talk about
[26:40] one was sleep apnea which means you stop
[26:45] breathing when you are you are asleep
[26:47] actually
[26:48] I want to thank God for my wife she's
[26:50] the one who realized that I was stopping
[26:53] breathing when I'm asleep
[26:56] so it went I was using this sleeping
[27:00] machine some of you who don't use it you
[27:02] don't know what Grace God has given you
[27:06] you are breathing normally when you are
[27:08] asleep that thing is terrible
[27:12] yet you have to use it because that's
[27:14] what you have there
[27:16] then come early this year something came
[27:20] in my heart and I said I'm not going to
[27:22] use it anymore
[27:24] and I used my faith to to stop it my
[27:28] wife was saying okay if God has led you
[27:30] to do it that is okay I'll pray with you
[27:34] so
[27:35] I started breathing okay
[27:37] and I'm not using the machine right now
[27:40] so sleep apnea is gone
[27:43] and
[27:44] [Applause]
[27:49] the second one was nasal
[27:53] um what do you call it this
[27:56] yeah
[27:57] what do you call it natural drainage
[28:01] so it has been giving me a lot of
[28:03] problems
[28:05] drainage drainage drainage
[28:09] so come around May
[28:11] we talked with my wife and we decided
[28:13] that we are going to stop some of the
[28:15] things
[28:16] so we stopped that nasal drainage
[28:19] and we were waiting to see what will
[28:22] happen
[28:23] and nothing happens
[28:26] because we prayed about it
[28:29] then
[28:32] brother Stephen was preaching here
[28:34] and we were saying let me paraphrase it
[28:37] I'm not going to say exactly what he
[28:39] said he said
[28:40] is it normal for you to have those all
[28:42] those medicines
[28:44] is it normal you think it's normal
[28:47] and I know some preachers you want to
[28:49] get amen but you know sometimes when you
[28:52] are hit so hard
[28:54] amen is not there
[29:01] so that that he's so hard is it really
[29:04] why should should we be using all these
[29:06] medicines really
[29:09] you could come and see how much I was
[29:11] having
[29:12] so I was
[29:14] unmet morphine for diabetes because I
[29:17] was struggling since 2014.
[29:21] um
[29:21] on and off
[29:23] bring it short because I know we have to
[29:25] have give time for the word
[29:27] last year July
[29:29] my A1C was 9.1
[29:33] okay
[29:35] but which means I was going on
[29:38] adding more metamorphin and you know the
[29:41] dangers of metamorphine
[29:43] and then
[29:46] come
[29:47] they gave me they added me another one
[29:50] called Julius
[29:51] to to bring it down
[29:55] so by
[29:57] January this year
[29:59] it was it came down with medicine and
[30:02] increased metamorphine it came down to
[30:05] 7.1
[30:07] so that's the time when I was hit during
[30:10] July June May June
[30:13] and we stopped it
[30:14] and we started the Met muffin and when
[30:17] brother was preaching here my wife wrote
[30:20] me a message we are stopping the
[30:22] audience too
[30:23] [Laughter]
[30:26] that was
[30:28] right there we are stopping Jordans too
[30:31] so I said okay
[30:35] then we stopped Jordans and that's why I
[30:38] took time I wanted to give this
[30:39] testimony after we have seen the doctor
[30:41] yes
[30:43] so I waited from June
[30:46] my blood sugar was 90s 110 120 if it
[30:50] goes too high before that it was higher
[30:53] than that
[30:54] so when I went to see the doctor this
[30:56] time it came down to 6.3
[31:00] without medicine
[31:02] yeah
[31:04] [Applause]
[31:13] so I want to thank God
[31:16] you know sometimes
[31:19] the things that our pastors say
[31:22] they are very
[31:24] led by God because
[31:26] of course you will go to heaven
[31:30] even if you are poor okay
[31:33] but you don't have to you can enjoy some
[31:35] here okay
[31:37] while you wait okay even sickness you
[31:41] can take away some of the problems while
[31:43] you're right here okay
[31:46] [Applause]
[31:49] so I want to thank God and praise him
[31:52] for his goodness to us
[31:54] there are so many
[31:57] countless that we can I can stand here
[32:00] and say but those are the highlights
[32:02] that I wanted to say God bless you and
[32:04] thank you God bless you
[32:05] [Applause]
