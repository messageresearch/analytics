[23:56] um first I'll start with brother Charles
[23:58] the second amen amen
[24:02] [Music]
[24:12] oh there you go okay now I told you I
[24:16] didn't give the whole testimony but
[24:18] three Witnesses came and said you should
[24:20] have gave the rest
[24:21] but um I'm gonna give it now by God's
[24:24] grace
[24:25] so with everything that transpired with
[24:28] the First with the first portion of it
[24:31] what I didn't say was
[24:34] when they offered me the position
[24:36] it came with a truck
[24:39] so
[24:40] when that truck came I don't pay no fuel
[24:44] I don't pay no maintenance if anything
[24:47] happens to that they take care of it
[24:49] it's completely 100 free
[24:53] now
[24:55] but when we were looking for the
[24:56] position
[24:58] we hit a we hit a spot to where my wife
[25:00] said she said sweetheart you got the
[25:02] experience but you just don't have the
[25:04] paper
[25:05] so you're gonna have to go to school
[25:06] somewhere or find somewhere you can get
[25:09] in the door to get the experience to
[25:11] equal to the paper
[25:15] I don't know well when they offered me
[25:19] the job during the interview
[25:20] he said would you mind going back to
[25:23] school for these things
[25:25] so he's paying for all of it
[25:28] so
[25:32] it's the last portion
[25:35] you know I had a few concussions in my
[25:37] life so my my brain wasn't working the
[25:39] way it supposed to work and anybody that
[25:41] suffered with concussions you know you
[25:43] you know that
[25:44] and um by God's grace it said Lord my
[25:47] you know this position you know I can't
[25:49] my mind can't do what it has done in
[25:51] times past I said I need you to restore
[25:53] to me that's that um Supreme
[25:56] intelligence that I had with you before
[25:58] the foundation of the world I lead my
[26:00] portion and when I got in the position
[26:03] and the first time I had to speak in
[26:05] front of everybody I was just amazed
[26:07] with the words that were coming out of
[26:08] my mouth so
[26:11] I'll leave the testimony with this
[26:14] I'll leave the Bride of Jesus Christ
[26:16] with this when brother Bradham says stay
[26:19] with that word stay with that word
[26:22] [Applause]
[26:26] stay with that word amen and amen amen
[26:31] amen
[26:33] amen
[26:35] so I
[26:37] I I just decided to start out with the
[26:39] husband uh because I know the wife comes
[26:42] after that so because it's like Airline
[26:44] man
[26:46] amen
[26:48] amen
[26:49] then after that we have sister diamond
[26:52] giving a testimony amen
[26:58] tough act to follow
[27:03] um but you know we live in the same
[27:05] household we're husband and wife but
[27:06] it's an individual walk
[27:09] um he had his trials at work I had my
[27:11] own and I was fortunate enough to be
[27:14] brought back to my old employer about a
[27:16] year ago exactly in May and you know he
[27:21] was good to me my hours if the children
[27:23] had something at school and I needed to
[27:25] leave I could do that so sometimes you
[27:28] you hold on too long
[27:30] I got into a crossroad to where I began
[27:33] you know at work they would you would
[27:35] hear them joking I would be at my desk
[27:37] reading my messages or praying or
[27:40] talking about the Lord to another
[27:41] co-worker of mine and you would hear the
[27:43] jokes about the Lord and I said okay
[27:45] lord well they're not talking to me so
[27:47] Lord just forgive them and I would you
[27:50] know go about my business and then
[27:51] pastor preached a couple Sundays ago
[27:55] we're living below our means mediocracy
[27:57] we're compromising we don't have to know
[28:01] who we are and it begins to really Vex
[28:03] my spirit just sitting there and I said
[28:05] Lord I said I need you to either move
[28:07] them or move me
[28:09] and you know I'm in school for
[28:12] accounting and same situation not having
[28:15] the experience but not the paperwork so
[28:16] the doors are being closed and closed
[28:18] and closed and so I said well it's not
[28:21] my time to apply my husband's telling me
[28:23] my mom's telling me my co-worker where
[28:24] you need to apply you need to no I said
[28:27] I'm praying on it the Lord will direct
[28:28] me well
[28:30] just like Downton Thomas the lord loves
[28:32] us all he knows what he has to do to get
[28:34] each and every one of us
[28:36] I overheard a joke and someone in the
[28:40] office sneezed and my direct supervisor
[28:43] said huh God bless you and then it was a
[28:46] statement he made after I won't repeat
[28:47] it but it was so offensive
[28:49] to the Lord that I serve I said that's
[28:52] it I don't have something inside of me
[28:54] rolls up faith has muscles I don't have
[28:56] to compromise this is the day
[28:58] and I had applied maybe the Wednesday
[29:02] before that four position hadn't heard
[29:04] anything back
[29:05] they reached out to me that day
[29:08] I said oh Lord what are you doing and at
[29:11] the time most of the time I researched

[38:51] he was done actually for free
[38:55] and I had to give man to force the man

[38:59] actually for free
[39:03] it's another testimony
[39:06] [Music]
[39:09] amen
[39:10] amen so what I gave is just the talking

[47:11] Heaven how many what the second time and
[47:14] he said by who myself have I sworn saved
[47:18] the Lord for because thou has done this
[47:21] thing and has not withheld thy son thy
[47:25] only son is that right now we don't want
[47:28] to make these scriptures already you
[47:30] know a common to us so we'll see what
[47:33] the prophet of God said about this so
[47:35] we'll see how we're going to come up
[47:36] tonight right he's going to bring us up
[47:39] to stand is that right this is an
[47:42] individual walk is that right God just
[47:45] didn't call you for nothing at all is
[47:46] that right no no no no no no no he
[47:49] called you for a purpose yes sir he said
[47:51] now look he said that in blessing I will
[47:55] what
[47:56] who's going to do it God's doing it
[47:59] that's why the pastor came up and said
[48:01] God is blessing us yes God is blessing

[48:06] thing we give him the praise him the
[48:09] honor yes we give him the Glory thank

[48:21] the same in which are upon the sea and
[48:24] thy seed shall possess what
[48:26] enemies but not if come on now we should
[48:30] be the happiest people in the world not
[48:33] if he shall right he shall right yes
[48:37] we're going to possess every enemy the
[48:40] enemies should have no hope in your life
[48:43] that's your Victory no nothing in his
[48:45] life why because you are the Royal Sea
[48:49] of Abraham yes sir
[48:51] [Applause]
[48:53] Hallelujah
[48:57] he said and in and in dice he said You
[49:01] shall possess the gates of his enemy and
[49:04] in thy seed shall all the nations of the
[49:07] earth be blessed because thou has what
[49:09] obeyed may the Lord add a blessing to
[49:12] the reading of the word you may be
[49:13] seated amen
[49:15] he said now
[49:17] you know it's something because I didn't
[49:19] know which way by the grace of God we're
[49:21] going to go it's just so much been
[49:23] opening up when I leave here and you're
[49:25] going to the institution you know you
[49:27] kind of got to go another Direction so
[49:30] if I go this way that way y'all keep me
[49:32] in the middle and keep praying say Lord
[49:34] bring him back so you gotta realize
[49:36] right we get around and because we've
[49:39] been working with that inner man you
[49:41] know we're still working with that inner
[49:43] man with them there's something now that
[49:45] is going to happen when the Holy Spirit
[49:47] changed that channel you know he was
[49:49] talking about the body the spirit and
[49:52] the Soul you know they don't have the
[49:54] little they can't get a whole other deep
[49:56] things yet right first we got to help
[49:58] them in being born again you got to
[50:01] bring him in the office of a prophet you
[50:03] got to bring in these things but God has
[50:05] given us grace and mercy to do so and so
[50:09] when you're dealing with that inner man
[50:11] you know you'll find out that that voice
[50:14] that's speaking to you and the things
[50:16] that you speaker is not really you in
[50:20] the flesh is that right it's not that
[50:22] fun not that she takes feel smell in
[50:25] here person is that right so you have to
[50:28] now God is bringing us to be able to
[50:31] fight this spiritual war in the end time
[50:34] now because we wrestle not against flesh
[50:36] and blood but against principalities and
[50:39] powers and wickedness and rulers in high
[50:41] places so what you have to do is get in
[50:44] your position is that right if you don't
[50:46] get in your position if you jump in here
[50:48] you jump in there you're running here
[50:50] you're running in I'm trying to tell you
[50:52] something God is just going to keep with
[50:54] you whooping you is that right because
[50:56] he promised he's not going to lose not a
[50:58] one so we have to understand for you to
[51:01] fully be operating the way God called
[51:04] you first you got to get in your
[51:06] position once you learn your position
[51:08] and then you know you have that
[51:10] Authority because God will confirm it
[51:13] with what signs and wonders and things
[51:16] behind it the these signs shall follow
[51:18] them that what believe is that right so
[51:22] we're going to show you that this
[51:24] Abraham seed you know where I got my
[51:26] timer on here so I'm all right he got
[51:29] around there so
[51:30] you have to realize in this hour now who
[51:34] you really really are that right so we
[51:37] want to do some reading tonight and
[51:39] we're going to jump back and forth
[51:41] um in some scriptures also so we're
[51:44] coming out of the inspiration came out
[51:47] of the patriarch
[51:48] um Abraham right
[51:50] that's where the inspiration comes it
[51:52] was the faith test promise of the word
[51:55] okay because each each time God gives us
[52:01] the word but being the Seed of Abraham
[52:05] or a Believer all of us is going to be
[52:08] tried and tested you're gonna be tried
[52:12] and tested that's why he said we wrestle
[52:15] not against flesh and blood but against
[52:17] principalities and powers and wickedness
[52:19] and rulers we're at in high places so
[52:22] we're so what we're dealing with is an
[52:25] organized Army of Satan so we remember
[52:29] our War's religion versus salvation this
[52:33] religion versus salvation so let's read
[52:36] down here I meant the paragraph two
[52:39] with the message 2 7 64. those that
[52:43] streaming if you want to uh keep up
[52:45] y'all just got to bear with me don't
[52:47] have a board so you got to pray he said
[52:49] now he said well look when God promised
[52:52] that thy seed shall possess the gates of
[52:57] the enemy the enemy he says now what a
[53:00] promise because because of what
[53:03] obedience is that right
[53:06] so now we're getting somewhere it's
[53:08] because of obedience like when I tell
[53:11] them in an institution obedience brings
[53:14] you a blessing Disobedience bring you a
[53:17] consequence so you have to understand
[53:19] when you're when you're Abraham's seed
[53:22] let me keep going he said now what a
[53:25] promise because of obedience obedience
[53:28] is what God wants it was once said
[53:31] obedience is better than sacrifice is
[53:33] that right the Lord is better than
[53:35] sacrifice he knows the time he was
[53:38] talking about in The Book of Samuel
[53:39] remember me shall God came and he was
[53:41] working with Samuel then by the way
[53:43] there and he was there and he was trying
[53:45] to tell Samuel uh uh with Saul and Saul
[53:48] was telling him he should have stuck
[53:49] with the word like you heard from
[53:51] somebody's testimony I think might have
[53:53] been John said what stay with the word
[53:55] you stay with the word and when you
[53:58] speak there because why because the word
[54:00] is God and it will lead and guide you
[54:03] into all truth so he told them when he
[54:05] was telling Saul remember Saul didn't
[54:08] stay with the word and so God had to
[54:10] take what he had to take that Authority
[54:13] in that position from him and when he
[54:15] took it from him but you got to remember
[54:17] that Disobedience you can be careful
[54:19] because now you you can open the door
[54:22] for sorcery you can open the door for
[54:25] witchcraft you can open the door with
[54:27] those iniquity Spirits is that right
[54:29] I'll tell you what some of you looking
[54:31] at me turn to first Samuel 15.
[54:34] help me Lord
[54:36] he's getting around in there
[54:38] he says uh first Samuel 15 for the sake
[54:42] of time let's look at verse uh 20 uh 22.
[54:48] what you have it say Amen
[54:50] and Sam you said have the Lord has the
[54:53] great delight and burning offer and
[54:55] sacrifices and obeying the voice of the
[54:58] Lord behold to obey his what better than
[55:02] sacrifice and and hearken than the fat
[55:05] of rams he says for what rebellious is
[55:09] as the sin of what witchcraft he said so
[55:13] in stubbornness is as this as iniquity
[55:16] and what idolatry because thou has
[55:19] rejected thy what the word of the Lord
[55:25] huh so you're not running and moving
[55:29] rejecting the pastor you're not running
[55:32] and moving rejecting the order of the
[55:34] Lord I mean of us of the deacons or the
[55:38] trustees of someone what you're running
[55:40] against you're kicking up against the
[55:43] word of God that's what you're kicking
[55:45] up against
[55:46] and so especially if you know better is
[55:49] that right so you need to be careful
[55:52] because you this Mission here that has
[55:55] been given to the to the pastor and the
[55:58] ministry that come through is to bring
[56:00] you higher is that right it is to bring
[56:03] you higher not to stay in a religious uh
[56:06] sector it's to bring you higher because
[56:09] you already have your salvation right
[56:11] because you told us Prosper as your what
[56:14] so Prosper your soul is prospering is
[56:18] because Christ already came and paid for
[56:21] your salvation is that right now once
[56:24] the Holy Ghost comes in there in your
[56:26] life he's the leading and guiding you
[56:28] into all the truth so you gotta want to
[56:31] receive these blessings just bear with
[56:33] us by the grace of God and we'll see
[56:35] what the prophet said here
[56:37] he said now we're facing a grand Patriot
[56:41] Abraham he said which was called the
[56:44] father of what faith because that God
[56:47] made him the what the promise to inherit
[56:50] the earth and who else and his seed not
[56:53] just Abraham but the Abraham seed now
[56:57] you have to realize who you are right so
[57:00] sometimes God wants to show us how to
[57:03] operate and for you to operate you got
[57:06] to understand that inner man is that
[57:09] right then you've got to understand when
[57:11] the spirit is moving that inner man and
[57:14] sometime it may be someone in the world
[57:17] that God is speaking to to give you a
[57:20] message
[57:22] we got testimony it's the testimony
[57:25] night you know I've got an institution
[57:27] down there I'm going in three
[57:29] institutions now you keep praying for me
[57:31] and sometimes we Minister four times a
[57:34] week you gotta understand what God is
[57:36] doing God is what he's loading me up
[57:39] here so when I go out there I got them
[57:42] credit for every demon every religious
[57:45] demon that tries to come against me
[57:48] because God said uh no weapons formed
[57:51] against me shall what prosperous so you
[57:55] gotta understand them we were sitting in
[57:57] a meeting one time and we were looking
[57:59] going down trying to get into an
[58:01] institution and the brother came and all
[58:04] he did was ask me we were sitting next
[58:06] to me he said brother are you down in
[58:09] the Mecklenburg yeah
[58:11] and I looked at him
[58:13] but it wasn't him it wasn't him that
[58:16] said it you got to understand when it's
[58:18] a voice down here that speaks to you
[58:22] and when you got around in them and if
[58:24] it's God come on we're bringing you up
[58:26] that's what the Holy Spirit been
[58:28] ministering through the pastor he's
[58:30] trying to understand that inner man is
[58:33] that right when you're dealing with that
[58:34] inner man so what you got the body you
[58:37] got the spirit you got the soul but
[58:40] remember he said what when that light
[58:42] come is that right when that light and
[58:45] that sperm and that egg straight is what
[58:47] now that seed is coming forth is that
[58:50] right is life that's going to start
[58:52] moving but down in there you can have
[58:55] who you can have faith or you can have
[58:57] doubt is that right you're right because
[59:00] you had Jacob and you had Esau is that
[59:02] right he said Jacob by love and Esau I
[59:05] hate it even that time it's funny when
[59:07] there's something faith that inter
[59:09] strikes you so I went on there and I
[59:11] called and when I called the lady said
[59:14] oh they hadn't called you yet to be
[59:17] reinstated you see so it wasn't it
[59:21] wasn't him it was is God speaking
[59:23] through him you got to learn that he and
[59:26] have an ear let him hear what the spirit
[59:29] is saying to you amen
[59:32] amen
[59:33] [Applause]
[59:35] then we come down there and the Lord is
[59:37] richly blessing okay you're having a
[59:40] study
[59:41] we can minister to one-on-one
[59:44] we go pray with them
[59:47] God is doing some great things and
[59:50] that's what I'm saying you got to
[59:51] understand we'll keep going in a minute
[59:53] but you got to realize what God wants to
[59:57] do through you God just didn't call you
[1:00:00] just to sit there and do anything that's
[1:00:02] why the holy spirit said no one's
[1:00:05] de-christianizing you but what are you
[1:00:08] doing since you got the Holy Ghost you
[1:00:11] see so now we got to understand that God
[1:00:15] is vindicating what he called us to do
[1:00:17] so within them and the Lord is just
[1:00:20] richly really richly blessing and we got
[1:00:23] a good just some things going on I can't
[1:00:25] say on on the tube but it's just some
[1:00:28] great things that's going on huh
[1:00:33] and and I'm telling you you'll see the
[1:00:36] devil just ain't gonna let you walk in
[1:00:37] now we gotta have one when we went to
[1:00:40] the meeting and we went to the meet I
[1:00:42] went to one of their sisters and she was
[1:00:44] going to help me she said well you want
[1:00:46] me to talk to the sheriff I worked with

[1:01:26] mean bless the Lord all my what
[1:01:29] huh what's in the soul it's the seed
[1:01:32] that's down in the soul so the seed
[1:01:34] that's down in the soul it feeds off the

[1:01:55] feeds off of so you're dealing with body
[1:01:58] you're dealing with the spirit and
[1:02:00] you're dealing with the soul and so the
[1:02:02] Lord came and ministered US told us no
[1:02:05] don't judge yourself on your zodiac sign
[1:02:12] [Music]
[1:02:13] don't judge yourself on your flesh
[1:02:18] don't judge yourself on what part of the
[1:02:21] earth you were born in is that right
[1:02:23] don't judge yourself by your education
[1:02:27] so the Lord came and showed us those
[1:02:31] things are temporal that's right yes
[1:02:34] you're dealing with it you got body you
[1:02:36] got Spirit you got sower those things
[1:02:40] are what and your spirit are temporal is
[1:02:43] that right but now deep down in your
[1:02:46] soul that's it God put a seed there yes
[1:02:49] he put a foundation of the world now and
[1:02:53] why is he the faith or even doubt is
[1:02:56] that right we feed man should not live
[1:02:58] by what bread alone but by what
[1:03:01] everywhere
[1:03:03] Saints preach yes

[1:03:21] huh
[1:03:24] then he's like preach that devil don't
[1:03:27] like that
[1:03:29] because he's bringing it from his soul
[1:03:32] it's something down in his soul you just
[1:03:34] can't bring it up like that just for
[1:03:36] entertainment no stop
[1:03:40] [Applause]

[1:03:50] things are temporal
[1:03:52] but he said oh bless my soul and forget
[1:03:55] not all thy benefits it's in the words
[1:03:58] let me keep going help me Lord he said
[1:04:01] we're facing now he said because God
[1:04:03] made him the promise
[1:04:06] he says in inherit to inherit the earth
[1:04:10] and his seed he said so and it's through
[1:04:14] Abraham we being dead in Christ become
[1:04:18] Abraham's seed and or what heirs with
[1:04:22] him according to the promise that's a
[1:04:25] powerful thing when you answer
[1:04:27] everything that God has your heirs to
[1:04:30] what Christ has that's why the same
[1:04:33] movement that Christ that when Christ
[1:04:35] was here that's how we got the
[1:04:37] testimonies we got those testimonies is
[1:04:41] because you're Abraham see and you're
[1:04:43] believing the word so it can't just be
[1:04:46] louder the testimonies will continue to
[1:04:48] come
[1:04:51] he said now you look now Abraham was
[1:04:54] just an ordinary man
[1:04:56] Ordinary People common people you know
[1:04:59] what I'm saying well used to say

[1:05:24] that out he said look he says in Abraham
[1:05:28] sees our heirs with with him according
[1:05:30] to what the promise

[1:05:38] never called him as far as as we have
[1:05:40] any record until he was what 75. right
[1:05:44] he said God called a complete what this
[1:05:47] is where we get in trouble some of us
[1:05:49] God called a complete separation from
[1:05:53] any doubt

[1:08:06] wanted you just to see that there but he
[1:08:09] has rejected the word of the Lord that's

[1:08:12] sharing that with you when people were
[1:08:13] disobedient what you're doing you're
[1:08:15] rejecting the word of God
[1:08:17] and God's trying to bring you into

[1:08:34] Hallelujah help me Lord we're going to
[1:08:37] get to some uh individuals in a minute
[1:08:39] just bear bear with me because I want
[1:08:42] you to see what the prophet of God said
[1:08:44] on these things here he said the child
[1:08:46] he's he he said now he knows God
[1:08:49] promised it he said the child in the
[1:08:51] ladder when he returned when Abraham
[1:08:54] went there with the child and the lab he
[1:08:58] didn't have any doubt because God
[1:09:00] promised it if God said it it's going to
[1:09:03] happen it's going to happen in God's
[1:09:06] time but it's gonna happen is that right
[1:09:09] he said now let us keep going he says
[1:09:12] that's all we care to know he said I'm
[1:09:15] at 14 paragraph 14 the ones is writing
[1:09:18] it down he says that's all we care to
[1:09:21] know he said God promised it how it's
[1:09:25] going to be I can't tell you but God
[1:09:28] said so he says he will send Jesus
[1:09:31] Christ the second time he will come in a
[1:09:33] physical form is that right we know
[1:09:36] we're looking for the second coming of
[1:09:39] Christ is that right so we're looking at
[1:09:42] the second coming of Christ is because
[1:09:44] God promised it he said I will not have
[1:09:47] you what ignorant is that right he said
[1:09:50] the Lord who himself shall descend from
[1:09:54] heaven what with a shout with a voice
[1:09:56] and with a trunk he already came not a
[1:10:00] physical Court body when he came on the
[1:10:03] mountain he came down and opened his
[1:10:05] seals up for each and every one of us is
[1:10:08] that right the ones that don't want the
[1:10:10] seals and they don't want the Thunders
[1:10:12] that Sumter it then that's why some of
[1:10:15] you you're going to find out you're
[1:10:17] still fighting this battle in your flesh
[1:10:19] and moving forward prospering is that
[1:10:22] right especially in your health because
[1:10:24] what you're doing is you're not taking
[1:10:27] down the rapturing faith of Grace
[1:10:30] message everybody is invented the
[1:10:33] pastor's sharing with you look at the
[1:10:35] question and answers
[1:10:36] huh look at themselves okay he's sharing
[1:10:41] those things you're ages he's sharing
[1:10:44] those things with you because he's gonna
[1:10:46] build your rapturing faith of Grace you
[1:10:49] gotta have him now because why the
[1:10:52] second oil now has been open Matthew 25
[1:10:56] is that right we know that he came now
[1:10:59] and that oil that we're getting now is
[1:11:03] those the Thunders that was hidden up
[1:11:05] under the seals is that right so now we
[1:11:08] had to have a covenant Messenger to come
[1:11:11] and bring us that message to get us
[1:11:14] ready to meet Jesus in the air is that
[1:11:17] right let me keep what I'm trying to I'm
[1:11:20] interpreting I'm trying to do my best
[1:11:21] slowing down he said now look
[1:11:25] he says now he said all that we know
[1:11:28] they come in a second time the physical
[1:11:31] body he says and with the redeem let us
[1:11:33] drop down there to what verse 15 chapter
[1:11:36] 15. he said he promised to do what heal
[1:11:40] the sick
[1:11:42] now we don't know how you're gonna do it
[1:11:45] but he promised
[1:11:46] amen God promised to do it
[1:11:49] in this agent now if Christ is back
[1:11:52] inform again Christ said all scriptures
[1:11:56] are written by the inspiration of God is
[1:12:00] that right for reproof for correction
[1:12:02] all is worth now so the same as Christ
[1:12:06] when he was here in the flesh the son of
[1:12:09] man the first time he was here now he's
[1:12:11] here again what in the spirit form is
[1:12:14] that right so to see Jesus Christ is the
[1:12:17] same yesterday today and forever never
[1:12:21] so we should be lacking nothing God
[1:12:25] promised he said told us forget not all
[1:12:28] those what benefits his Lord came and
[1:12:32] the Lord thy God that heal of all thy
[1:12:35] diseases is that right when Moses came
[1:12:38] up against they had to be what used when
[1:12:41] Moses came and he had to be tested and
[1:12:44] the time for him to bring them out of
[1:12:46] the liver bringing them bringing being
[1:12:48] the deliver her and bringing Egypt
[1:12:50] bringing Israel out of Egypt come on now
[1:12:53] Moses what he had to do he had to be
[1:12:56] tried and he had to be tested so if he
[1:12:59] tried and he had to be tested so he had
[1:13:01] to run up against who uh uh James and
[1:13:05] Jamboree is that right they had a ride
[1:13:07] and Moses had a ride but Moses had to be
[1:13:10] tested but Moses knew that who God sent
[1:13:13] to him is that right God told him Moses
[1:13:16] I'm going to deliver my people but I'm
[1:13:19] gonna show you these things you're going
[1:13:20] to have to be facing up against him so
[1:13:23] when he came in there and when he ran up
[1:13:25] against that what sorceries that right
[1:13:27] Moses but God had to vindicate that
[1:13:30] Moses was his man and when Moses was his
[1:13:33] man he swallowed up what their rod is
[1:13:36] that right now it's the same way when
[1:13:39] we're out there we're battling these
[1:13:41] religious demons when the religious
[1:13:43] demons that's out there now you got now
[1:13:45] we got the word by Revelation that God
[1:13:49] is bringing us is that right you don't
[1:13:51] have to worry about because we got the
[1:13:53] quote and you got the message which is
[1:13:55] the revelation of the word which is all
[1:13:58] of them is what one so we have the women
[1:14:01] the word is the voice of God so you
[1:14:04] should meet him no sicknesses no
[1:14:07] diseases no Affliction will come apart
[1:14:10] in your body is that right and when it
[1:14:13] comes and someone asks you what's wrong
[1:14:15] uh I'm okay I'm glorifying God God is
[1:14:19] going to come and make it delivered God
[1:14:21] said it this sickness this disease is
[1:14:25] doing what it's trespassing is that
[1:14:27] right this disease and this sickness is
[1:14:30] trespassing you have to understand it's
[1:14:33] like a natural code when you get a
[1:14:35] natural code and that natural cold when
[1:14:37] they get there on your body you got to
[1:14:39] be able you know when it's coming when
[1:14:42] you know it's coming you gotta drink you
[1:14:43] some hot tea you got to get around there
[1:14:45] and get the bacteria off your tongue and
[1:14:48] out of your mouth was the same way when
[1:14:50] Satan Satan come at you like he came at
[1:14:53] Jesus is that right he said man should
[1:14:56] he says he said if you be the Son of God
[1:14:58] turn these words stones to bread is that
[1:15:02] right until you say what man should not
[1:15:04] live by bread alone but by every word I
[1:15:07] perceive the value of the mouth of God
[1:15:09] we're talking about being tested and
[1:15:12] we're talking about your faith now being
[1:15:15] tested you got to understand I'ma get
[1:15:19] back to the reading but you got to
[1:15:21] understand in this hour here now it's a
[1:15:24] lot of lack of faith they got more
[1:15:26] doctors more medicine more equipment all
[1:15:30] these things but there's less Faith out
[1:15:32] there is that right A man is not going
[1:15:34] to be quick not to tell you not to take
[1:15:36] something when he's making two 10 or 15
[1:15:40] billion dollars a year off of it you
[1:15:42] think he's not going to tell you I'm
[1:15:44] telling you that your faith has to be
[1:15:46] tested maybe this is testimony night
[1:15:48] then let me tell you about when my wife
[1:15:50] and I went to the doctor you know when
[1:15:52] we go there to the doctor sometimes I
[1:15:55] guess they look at me and they look at

[1:20:53] works is bad enough you'll know me by my
[1:20:56] faith by my works and you know my works
[1:20:58] by my faith son got to back you go ahead
[1:21:01] and do it why because now you're putting
[1:21:03] God on the spot you're putting God Out
[1:21:06] There Our God we serve a great God a
[1:21:09] mighty God is able to keep all of his
[1:21:12] promises no woman in his bride shall be
[1:21:15] unfruitful or Byron is that right you
[1:21:18] got a sickness you got an illness in
[1:21:20] your body keep speaking it it's
[1:21:23] trespassing it has no right to touch
[1:21:26] your body
[1:21:28] [Applause]
[1:21:33] say look help me Lord he said now he
[1:21:37] says and that's the way Abraham believed
[1:21:39] God
[1:21:41] now is asked to destroy now look what he
[1:21:44] said they wanted him to destroy the
[1:21:45] evidence they wanted him to destroy iron
[1:21:48] the evidence is that right but he had to
[1:21:52] be tested right but it has to be tested
[1:21:54] but he's focused the latter and I shall
[1:21:57] what return
[1:21:59] is that right
[1:22:01] brother Brandon said it was the buzzing
[1:22:03] the intellect battle started he said the
[1:22:06] intellect started up there that's why
[1:22:08] some of you don't get what you need
[1:22:10] right now because you're listening too
[1:22:12] much of what the doctor said you're
[1:22:14] reading too much on the internet you're
[1:22:17] out there running and looking at that
[1:22:19] forces is that right because God
[1:22:21] promised it to you now if the pastor the
[1:22:23] Lord give a pastor something for you to
[1:22:25] tell you then you become disobedient you
[1:22:28] don't become obedient to the word of the
[1:22:30] Lord so you become to a halt is that
[1:22:33] right maybe something is affecting your
[1:22:35] health or maybe getting your finances or
[1:22:38] what you what you need there are the
[1:22:40] life if God promised to supply all of
[1:22:43] your needs is that right he promised it
[1:22:49] you have to write if you've Got
[1:22:51] Confidence with God if you're doing what
[1:22:54] God's sharing with you telling you to do
[1:22:56] then you've got right to go to God to
[1:22:58] find out why is that right if you've got
[1:23:01] a business and that business is not
[1:23:03] prospering if you prayed and you went to
[1:23:05] God and God told you to get it then you
[1:23:07] need to go to God and ask God why it's
[1:23:10] not prospering is that right
[1:23:13] that's exactly right Faith tested that's
[1:23:17] what it is the promised words he said
[1:23:19] help us Lord he said Not only did he
[1:23:22] give give this great
[1:23:24] he says and that's the way Abraham
[1:23:27] believed he said now was asked to
[1:23:30] destroy every evidence that his promise
[1:23:33] would be taken care of but he was
[1:23:35] persuaded that God could do it raise him
[1:23:39] right back he says not only he gave he
[1:23:42] gave this great promise he give it to
[1:23:45] who his seeds you see and also and
[1:23:49] because Abraham was what faithful the
[1:23:53] word God God promised him and knowed
[1:23:56] that God could raise up this child and
[1:24:00] he spared not his own what child but
[1:24:03] with God his son let me drop one down
[1:24:05] for the sake of time he said all
[1:24:08] Abraham's seeds all Abraham's seed as us
[1:24:13] as Christ see as the faith see that's
[1:24:16] the Royal seed is that right all Abraham
[1:24:19] she believes God just like that
[1:24:23] God said it I believe it I stand on it
[1:24:28] and that's it
[1:24:30] we don't look at the condition we are
[1:24:33] the Abraham seed the faith see the
[1:24:39] look who we are my my my We're The Germ
[1:24:43] of God
[1:24:44] we're the economy of God
[1:24:47] huh the devil can't touch this what we
[1:24:50] got he can't come near it
[1:24:53] he said now look he said oh Abraham she
[1:24:57] believes like that they are believing
[1:25:00] God and we know that it pleases God so
[1:25:04] well that here is what he what he said
[1:25:06] what the seed shall do what possess the
[1:25:10] gates of his enemy
[1:25:12] but what after the trial
[1:25:16] everybody's going to be tried and tested
[1:25:20] he said now look he said remember he's
[1:25:23] he said now remember that we shall
[1:25:27] possess the gates of the enemy that's
[1:25:29] thus say the Lord Abraham's C believes
[1:25:32] that if you are a genuine Seed of
[1:25:36] Abraham
[1:25:37] the faith that Abraham had in God
[1:25:41] it's in you
[1:25:45] is that not your hook and you believe
[1:25:48] that what God's saying has said God
[1:25:52] keeps his promises he said now you look
[1:25:55] you look into the word you got to
[1:25:57] realize God has brought in examples In
[1:26:00] Those Old Testament looking shot right
[1:26:02] Michelle is that right they had to be
[1:26:05] what tried and tested is that right come
[1:26:09] on now look how much the Lord loved you
[1:26:11] so much
[1:26:13] look how much you love you what did she
[1:26:15] write me check in the Bendigo had to bow
[1:26:17] down to is that right once they did what
[1:26:20] played the music come past them once
[1:26:23] they played the music is that right some
[1:26:25] of you gotta understand now it's just
[1:26:28] music what's in the music it was the
[1:26:30] rhythm is that right he told us It's the
[1:26:32] Rhythm that grabs a hold of them so why
[1:26:35] did why did Nebuchadnezzar first start
[1:26:38] playing the music is that right because
[1:26:41] they know if they didn't bow down to the
[1:26:43] music and then he was going to what
[1:26:46] throw them into the fire is that right
[1:26:48] so we all got to be what tried and
[1:26:51] tested so shy right me Shaq independigo
[1:26:54] they had a fake seed inside of them and
[1:26:57] they recognized that their God how great
[1:27:00] their God was no matter what what
[1:27:03] Nebuchadnezzar would try to do to them
[1:27:06] they're not they wasn't going to bow
[1:27:08] down to that God so we have to
[1:27:11] understand the anything come at you any
[1:27:15] sickness any diseases any doubt if you
[1:27:19] know you apply for a specific job and
[1:27:22] you need that job God will get that job
[1:27:25] for you if it's there to glorify God if
[1:27:28] you need a certain vehicle to get your
[1:27:31] to and fro from work God will get that
[1:27:34] vehicle for you because you need that
[1:27:37] vehicle don't cut yourself short that's
[1:27:41] what the Holy Spirit been saying don't
[1:27:43] cut yourself short you would believe in
[1:27:45] the word of God he said of your word
[1:27:48] abide in me and I abide in you whatever
[1:27:51] you ask you what you can't receive is
[1:27:54] that right but you're going to be tried
[1:27:56] and tested Satan is going to bring all
[1:27:59] kinds of obstacles before you he's going
[1:28:02] to throw stumbling blocks before you so
[1:28:06] we have to understand that God is
[1:28:08] greater is he that is in thee is that
[1:28:11] right then he that is in world so what
[1:28:14] is he building you have to be tried and
[1:28:17] tested so your character can be just
[1:28:20] like him job said we brought nothing in
[1:28:23] this world we'll take nothing out of
[1:28:26] this world but Joe was talking about
[1:28:28] material things and things you could see
[1:28:31] but who the character because the Bible
[1:28:34] asks they say we may not appear to be
[1:28:37] anything but we're going to be just like
[1:28:40] him who when we leave here we gonna have
[1:28:43] the character of Christ is that right so
[1:28:46] you don't see the the seed of God is led
[1:28:50] by the spirit of God is that right
[1:28:53] you're not born of The Incorruptible
[1:28:55] seeds I mean other corruptible sea We
[1:28:59] Are The Incorruptible sea which is the
[1:29:02] word of God that's going to be

[1:36:05] around and looking is that she doing it
[1:36:08] purposely and she turned around catching
[1:36:10] you looking she see that you avoid of
[1:36:12] understanding is that right you're void
[1:36:14] of understanding so now that's why they
[1:36:16] call on the streets trick cause him some
[1:36:19] old filthy woman untaught her how to
[1:36:22] trap you is that right so you got to

[1:36:39] going to lead you to death then she's
[1:36:41] going to lead you to the Grave then
[1:36:43] she's going to lead you to hell is that
[1:36:45] right some of you got around in it you
[1:36:48] got to understand what she's trying to
[1:36:49] do to you young man so we get around
[1:36:51] there I said look at Samson is that
[1:36:53] right something played with Delilah

[1:36:58] with Samson brother Brandon said Samson
[1:37:00] was a ladies man is that right who said
[1:37:03] so she knew that is that right and she
[1:37:05] kept playing with him she kept playing
[1:37:07] with him in certain parts is that right
[1:37:09] and sooner or later what she do she
[1:37:11] deceived them why you gave God his heart
[1:37:14] but he gave him I mean it's hard to
[1:37:16] Delilah but he just gave God the
[1:37:18] strength is that right I don't know who
[1:37:20] that's for but some of you better leave

[1:46:21] when you are the Royal Sea of Abraham
[1:46:25] Abraham believed the Bible said he's
[1:46:28] staggered not at the promises of God but
[1:46:31] grew up strong in faith because God said
[1:46:35] it and he knew it was going to happen
[1:46:36] let me finish Peter here look at this
[1:46:39] seed here with Peter

[1:46:58] fighting against getting the Mysteries
[1:47:00] how are you going to fight against it
[1:47:01] how you're going to have Rapture and
[1:47:03] faith without it when he promised it the
[1:47:06] latter rain in the former ring it got to
[1:47:09] come prophet of God said it that's why
[1:47:11] he told Joshua he said whatever the soul
[1:47:15] of your foot tread he said what he said
[1:47:18] it shall be you you shall possess that
[1:47:21] land he said but you got to fight for
[1:47:24] every inch of it now for you to fight it
[1:47:27] you've got to speak it first and you got
[1:47:30] to speak it and you walk in it
[1:47:35] we're talking about the born-again of
[1:47:37] God look what he says he says in verse
[1:47:40] 22 he says and you being purified your
[1:47:43] souls and obeying the truth through what
[1:47:45] the spirit into the unformed love of
[1:47:47] what the Brethren see that she loved one
[1:47:50] another what they were pure her heart he
[1:47:52] said being born again not of the what
[1:47:55] but of the what
[1:47:58] by the what word of God which liveth an
[1:48:02] abideth win forever you see so it's the
[1:48:05] word of God that's moving inside of you
[1:48:09] you're being born again back to the word
[1:48:12] that's why the Lord was showing us that
[1:48:15] Elohim Elohim was out there all by
[1:48:18] himself
[1:48:19] he was in a self-existing one and then
[1:48:23] when he came down he did what Let There
[1:48:27] Be what light is that right oh my
[1:48:30] there's no that time Hallelujah just
[1:48:33] give me a few more minutes I'm about to
[1:48:35] stop
[1:48:35] uh help me Lord I'm gonna have to jump
[1:48:38] Hallelujah but we're born now the
[1:48:40] corrupt uh uh corruptable see but The
[1:48:43] Incorruptible seed which is by the word
[1:48:45] of God and that's why all your blessings
[1:48:47] is in the word through my Affliction my
[1:48:49] comfort come through the word of God
[1:48:51] that pray and read your Bible pick those
[1:48:53] those seals and those ages up just pick
[1:48:57] them up and read them constantly look at
[1:48:58] your time if you're wasting time most
[1:49:00] people that waste time you got financial
[1:49:02] problems uh
[1:49:07] huh because the businessman uh a
[1:49:10] businessman is based on his things on
[1:49:12] time and money what he's paying you he's
[1:49:14] basing it on time that's what he's
[1:49:16] basing it on so if you're not doing that
[1:49:17] then hello he said now look
[1:49:21] thus say the Lord let's look at Christ
[1:49:25] let's look at Christ here then we'll
[1:49:27] wind it up help us Lord he said now
[1:49:31] I'm a paragraph 61. he's there at
[1:49:34] paragraph 61. you can look into Romans 4
[1:49:37] 13 through 18. he said then one day
[1:49:39] Along Came what the Royal season of
[1:49:42] Abraham Jesus Christ the son of God
[1:49:44] Abraham see by what faith not through
[1:49:47] Isaac the natural scene they did not
[1:49:50] depart that's why last time when I was
[1:49:52] here I was working with the Inner Man
[1:49:53] and the inner man always have conflict
[1:49:55] with what the end of man has conflict
[1:49:57] with the flesh with the intellect with
[1:50:00] the carnal mind so that's why they can't
[1:50:03] grasp it no no you got to pray for your
[1:50:05] pastor pray for the gift it's not his
[1:50:07] gift is our gift it's my gift was the
[1:50:10] Bible said once it's revealed it's mine
[1:50:12] it's not what he said it's mine now I
[1:50:15] take it out there and when I take it out
[1:50:17] there I'm getting results uh why because
[1:50:20] I believe it I believe it I know it's
[1:50:23] God that's minister to us so when you
[1:50:25] take it you got to realize that what God
[1:50:27] has called you to do is that right help
[1:50:29] us Lord I know we're jumping tonight but
[1:50:31] let me keep going he said now
[1:50:34] not who was not Natural Born he come one
[1:50:37] and let me say this here thank you Jesus
[1:50:38] you got to understand some of you don't
[1:50:40] listen why did I believe the Lord we're
[1:50:42] sharing that about the medical terms
[1:50:44] because we're in the Supernatural walk
[1:50:46] is that right he told us to do what
[1:50:48] Pastor put on the what whole armor or
[1:50:50] what now we're talking about the whole
[1:50:52] armor of God a helmet of salvation let's
[1:50:54] play the righteousness preparation of
[1:50:56] the gospel of peace girtual good in your
[1:50:58] loins with truth but we're talking about
[1:51:00] the whole armor of God on the inner man
[1:51:02] that's what we're talking about that's
[1:51:04] what we've been ministering that's what
[1:51:06] he meant that's what we're getting it's
[1:51:07] the inner man is that right love peace
[1:51:10] Joy righteousness long-suffering is that
[1:51:13] right what's the Holy Spirit then he
[1:51:15] brings this flesh under subjection he
[1:51:17] bring your intellect under subjection
[1:51:19] now you're starting to recognize when
[1:51:21] that inner man is speaking to you and if
[1:51:23] it's him it will come to pass
[1:51:29] foreign
[1:51:30] that's why he came in through Luther's
[1:51:32] day that's why he had to come with what
[1:51:34] Malachi 4 Luke 17 30. Revelations 10 7.
[1:51:38] is that right Abraham had to come which
[1:51:41] was Melchizedek he had to see that sign
[1:51:43] is that right that sign of Melchizedek I
[1:51:46] think it was Genesis 17 when he came to
[1:51:48] the 10th what did God do God burned that
[1:51:51] body is that right he said that same
[1:51:54] sign that had to be brought again but
[1:51:56] was not brought yet he had to tell
[1:51:58] William Mary and Brenham don't drink her
[1:52:01] don't smoke her don't do anything to
[1:52:03] your body why because I gotta use that
[1:52:06] body to bring this last sign to my bride
[1:52:09] in the last time the no Christ is not
[1:52:12] dead but he's alive the resurrected
[1:52:14] Christ is here back on the scene again

[1:58:25] the word
[1:58:27] amen
[1:58:28] you know brother Branham say if you got
[1:58:30] God inside of you
[1:58:32] you see God everywhere
[1:58:36] you know that
[1:58:38] I remember being in school
[1:58:40] and they were teaching Immunology
[1:58:43] and when I'm looking at the slide I'm
[1:58:45] seeing the seals
[1:58:48] I see how your body fight he looks like
[1:58:51] the devil the way he's attacking the
[1:58:53] body it's looked like the first seal the
[1:58:55] second cell
[1:58:57] and I wrote The Sermon spiritual
[1:58:59] Immunology
[1:59:01] and I have not preached it yet since I
[1:59:04] was in Dental School
[1:59:05] in other words when God is in you when
[1:59:08] you're looking at things you see in God
[1:59:12] amen that's why he can remember the Lion
[1:59:15] King and he can see a message through
[1:59:19] amen
[1:59:21] amen
[1:59:22] do you know that that beat him on the
[1:59:25] head
[1:59:27] by the Bible do you know that
[1:59:30] do you know that when Simba was growing
[1:59:33] up the baboon hit him on the head
[1:59:35] he hit him the first time and he heard
[1:59:38] him and he came the second time and he
[1:59:40] dodged it do you know what he told him
[1:59:43] he says the past hurt
[1:59:46] but you can dodge it
[1:59:49] because the past was was what was
[1:59:52] blocking him to go back to take over
[1:59:58] so when the devil begin to bring your
[2:00:00] past
[2:00:01] dodge it
[2:00:02] [Music]
[2:00:04] [Applause]
[2:00:07] don't let the devil hit you with the
[2:00:10] past because you will hurt
[2:00:12] and when he hurt you at this courage you
[2:00:15] don't have the strength to continue but
[2:00:17] when he begin to bring the past you
[2:00:19] dodge it
[2:00:20] just remember who you are
[2:00:23] you have to look through the mirror of
[2:00:25] the word
[2:00:27] and to see who you are
[2:00:31] remember who you are
[2:00:33] remember who you are
[2:00:35] amen and go and take every territory
[2:00:39] that is not functioning properly
[2:00:42] everything that is below a hundredfold
[2:00:45] you need to fight for it
[2:00:47] amen you need to fight for it amen God
[2:00:52] gave you the victory God said so he
[2:00:55] knows what he's doing God is challenging
[2:00:58] our faith because we have been so lazy
[2:01:01] in this message so relax and we got used
[2:01:04] to everything we got health care we got
[2:01:08] this insurance we got this we got this
[2:01:10] we got this until we don't trust God for
[2:01:13] even a headache
[2:01:16] amen that's why God begin to rock the
[2:01:19] boat and Shake everything so now
[2:01:21] whenever they close the door
[2:01:24] you don't have to worry when the
[2:01:26] pressure of The ecumenical move begin to
[2:01:29] come you're not gonna be worrying about
[2:01:31] that pressure anymore why because you
[2:01:34] got the spoken word
[2:01:36] you're not gonna be worrying if Walmart
[2:01:38] is closed you're not gonna be worrying
[2:01:40] if Sam's Club is closed because you
[2:01:43] already got used to a god that is daily
[2:01:46] taking care of you and day by day he's
[2:01:50] unfolding his strength
[2:01:53] and his goodness towards you
[2:01:56] amen the trial is not your trial it is
[2:02:00] the trials of the faith but remember
[2:02:03] faith is always coupled with patience
[2:02:06] that patience is what gives you the
[2:02:09] under the endurance for you to continue
[2:02:11] to hold on to the promise until you get
[2:02:14] it amen actually when you get a vision
[2:02:18] from God you automatically have to be a
[2:02:21] prepared for a test
[2:02:23] but they're not testing you they're
[2:02:25] testing the vision that God gave you
[2:02:29] when Joseph got a vision he was so good
[2:02:32] he came up he said I saw everybody
[2:02:34] bowing down that Vision have to be
[2:02:37] tested but when he was testing he only
[2:02:40] developed your character and release the
[2:02:43] inner man and you will know really who
[2:02:45] you are after every battle that you went
[2:02:49] through now you can turn around you say
[2:02:51] I can see that I'm a better person than
[2:02:54] what I was before if I didn't go through
[2:02:56] that through this through this probably
[2:02:59] I would not have been closer to God the
[2:03:02] way I am right now
[2:03:03] so everything worketh together
[2:03:06] for good
[2:03:09] everything is working together for
[2:03:11] goodness
[2:03:12] everything
[2:03:14] we will understanding better when
[2:03:18] and you will appreciate God more and
[2:03:21] more before you begin you say oh my God
[2:03:23] now I see the reason why you were doing
[2:03:26] that amen God knows it
[2:03:37] you know that marriage that you start
[2:03:39] with your wife
[2:03:41] and you're buying your little stuff
[2:03:42] together
[2:03:44] and then you work together and then you
[2:03:47] buy a home together and you move
[2:03:48] together Those whom are more sweeter
[2:03:53] because you want together through the
[2:03:55] trial
[2:03:57] every trial in the family was just
[2:04:00] bringing you
[2:04:02] the devil thought he's gonna bust them
[2:04:04] up before you know it that's why brother
[2:04:06] Branham say tension is blessing it's
[2:04:09] attention and he comes back tension and
[2:04:12] until a certain time you will reach a
[2:04:14] time of peace
[2:04:15] you'd argue no more
[2:04:17] you know where everybody pretty good you
[2:04:20] can look at one another eyes and you
[2:04:22] understand what the person is saying you
[2:04:24] get the signal and you know what had to
[2:04:26] operate and and it's like automatic you
[2:04:29] are you are synchronized together
[2:04:32] but it takes certain trial to Rob Iran
[2:04:35] and get the dirt out by God these know
[2:04:38] what he's doing
[2:04:40] all right young people
[2:04:42] God knows what he's doing amen stay
[2:04:46] strong God is challenging our faith you
[2:04:50] can do it
[2:04:51] don't look at this man don't look at
[2:04:53] your zodiac don't look at where you were
[2:04:55] born don't look at your past failure
[2:04:58] look at the man who is inside as long as
[2:05:01] you have a breath of life
[2:05:04] there's still hope
[2:05:06] as long as you're living there's still
[2:05:09] hope
[2:05:10] as long as you're living meaning you
[2:05:12] have not finished the purpose of God yet
[2:05:15] in this life you still have something to
[2:05:18] do amen so cheer up
[2:05:21] and let's move on and fight again and
[2:05:24] recuperate some territory so on Sunday
[2:05:27] we come with more testimony
[2:05:29] amen let's pray Heavenly Father Lord we
[2:05:33] are approaching you humbly this evening
[2:05:35] Lord father once again thanking you for
[2:05:38] your grace for your love and for your
[2:05:41] mercy and father for speaking to our
[2:05:43] soul tonight

[2:05:47] and father reminding us
[2:05:49] Who We Are
[2:05:51] that we are the Royal Seed of Abraham
[2:05:54] and things that must seem normal
[2:05:56] because of the way we were educated and
[2:05:59] the civilization you begin to unforce to
[2:06:02] us that they are not normal they are
[2:06:04] contrary to your word
[2:06:06] they're not ramming together with what
[2:06:08] the promises of God are saying because
[2:06:11] in according to your promise you want us
[2:06:13] to prosper
[2:06:15] you want us to prosper in every aspect
[2:06:17] of our life
[2:06:18] you want us to have a a prosperity of
[2:06:22] our spiritual work with you you want our
[2:06:25] family to prosper spiritually to prosper
[2:06:28] material to prosper in every aspect and

[2:06:42] our soul also to continue to prosper
[2:06:44] father may you shake every devil
[2:06:48] that is trying to hang on to this to
[2:06:51] keep your children in bondage because
[2:06:53] the time have come that we have to stand
[2:06:56] and move on move on into the deep
[2:07:00] reality of God
[2:07:02] begin to experience the supernatural
[2:07:05] power of God
[2:07:06] begin to experience the things that we
[2:07:09] have been reading in the scripture that
[2:07:11] we thought it's only for Abraham it was
[2:07:14] only for Daniel he was only for Joseph
[2:07:17] but now father you're bringing them back
[2:07:20] into reality that we are more we are
[2:07:23] even the Royal seed
[2:07:25] father how can you take care of
[2:07:28] a generation that you destroy
[2:07:32] and when you came down in human flesh
[2:07:34] you say all of them were dead
[2:07:37] and your Prophet stated that they were
[2:07:40] totally
[2:07:41] eternally separated from you
[2:07:43] but that Eternal seed that was not even
[2:07:46] your seed you took care of them
[2:07:49] you give them bread
[2:07:51] when they whine you give them Lord
[2:07:54] father the flesh they quell
[2:07:57] you took care of them in the wilderness
[2:08:00] you healed them
[2:08:02] when they rebel against you
[2:08:05] father you took the present Serpent and
[2:08:07] you told that generation of rebellions
[2:08:10] to look and you heal them
[2:08:13] until they were all dead
[2:08:15] because your prophets say it was their
[2:08:18] children that have to enter in the
[2:08:20] Promised Land
[2:08:22] father if you can take care of a
[2:08:25] rebellion generation
[2:08:27] of people that withstood your messenger
[2:08:31] that shattered with Moses that argued
[2:08:34] that wanted to Stone Moses
[2:08:36] that were constantly longing to go back
[2:08:39] to Egypt
[2:08:41] they wanted to find a new captain that
[2:08:44] would take them back to Egypt
[2:08:46] there are even esteemed the things of
[2:08:48] Egypt
[2:08:49] greater than the manner that you have
[2:08:51] given them and yet you took care of them
[2:08:54] because of the promise that you gave to
[2:08:57] Abraham
[2:08:58] father how much more we who are honoring
[2:09:02] your prophet
[2:09:03] we don't argue with the prophet we are
[2:09:06] humbling ourselves
[2:09:08] below the word that was spoken by the
[2:09:11] prophet
[2:09:12] because we realized that it was not the
[2:09:15] word of man he was the unfailing body
[2:09:18] word of the son of man
[2:09:21] we don't chat with brother Branham we
[2:09:24] don't try to remove him from being the
[2:09:26] messenger we acknowledge and we respect
[2:09:28] it and we uphold his position where you
[2:09:32] put him Lord father how much more
[2:09:36] should you take care of us
[2:09:38] should you take care of our families
[2:09:42] should you take care of every single
[2:09:45] aspect of our life
[2:09:48] that is not functioning that is not
[2:09:51] responding well that is giving us
[2:09:54] trouble
[2:09:55] father may you Quicken that Revelation
[2:09:58] to your children
[2:10:00] that was the first Exodus that we are in
[2:10:03] the third one in the perfected one where
[2:10:06] not only are you changing the ins word
[2:10:09] man you're gonna change even the odd
[2:10:11] word man
[2:10:15] father you even told us that if we
[2:10:18] receive the one that you sent
[2:10:21] we will receive the prophet reward
[2:10:24] father we have cherished this message
[2:10:28] your Prophet taught us
[2:10:30] you don't only remember the curses
[2:10:33] but you remember the blessings
[2:10:35] father there are many of them in the
[2:10:37] Bible who remember them Lord and may the
[2:10:41] Holy Spirit Quicken them
[2:10:44] and pour them down in the life of this
[2:10:47] church
[2:10:48] in Every Family on this church
[2:10:51] may we see changes in our life
[2:10:54] May a spiritual realm broke
[2:11:00] open it Lord
[2:11:06] so that we can get access to the Unseen
[2:11:09] World
[2:11:13] father looked at the young children
[2:11:16] look at our young men
[2:11:19] that we call patriarch Lord
[2:11:25] father if any young man can be taken out
[2:11:29] to the world
[2:11:30] and the devil can fulfill his part so
[2:11:34] successfully
[2:11:38] until it's harder
[2:11:40] it's getting even harder
[2:11:42] to go by a day without seeing someone
[2:11:45] with tattoo
[2:11:48] father sure the Holy Spirit also
[2:11:51] will fulfill his word more
[2:11:55] may you take a hold of the young men of
[2:11:57] this church
[2:12:01] may you refocus them
[2:12:06] may you bring them Lord to a greater
[2:12:09] responsibility
[2:12:11] father make them prosper
[2:12:13] cut every bound
[2:12:17] Every Chain
[2:12:19] from the world
[2:12:20] every foolishness
[2:12:22] on the telephone on the computers
[2:12:28] every spirit of destruction
[2:12:31] that is always pulling them toward
[2:12:34] pleasure
[2:12:36] toward hanging around
[2:12:40] [Music]
[2:12:43] they are precious to us
[2:12:46] you gave us these children
[2:12:53] father make them prosper
[2:12:58] those that have backsliding
[2:13:02] those that seems to be offended by this
[2:13:05] message
[2:13:07] father we're not looking at them we're
[2:13:09] looking at our faith in you
[2:13:12] because you taught us to have faith in
[2:13:14] you
[2:13:15] father turn them around
[2:13:19] I don't care the situation
[2:13:21] because that's not the problem for you

[2:13:31] for every family in this church
[2:13:34] that heaven loved one that is not where
[2:13:37] they're supposed to be
[2:13:41] father May the Holy Spirit hunt them
[2:13:45] and bring them back to the folder
