[0:00] allotted to his great great grandson
[0:02] down here. The seed of the righteous.
[0:05] Now here comes the seed of the of the
[0:07] serpent. Now remember there'll be immity
[0:10] war between them. The seed of the
[0:14] serpent comes along and what does it
[0:16] produce? Now let's take the first few
[0:18] years and watch what takes place. Now we
[0:20] read it right down because I've just
[0:21] checked it up. The seed of the serpent
[0:23] produced Cain. Cain went to the land of
[0:26] Nod, produced giants. And then to come
[0:28] to the land of Noah, they were smart,
[0:31] educated, intelligent people. Is that
[0:34] right? They were builders, inventors,
[0:37] scientists, not through the seed of the
[0:39] righteous, but through the seed of
[0:40] Satan, the serpent. They were such man
[0:43] as as scientists and builders and great
[0:45] men, educators. The scripture says so.
[0:48] They worked brass. They worked iron.
[0:50] They worked metals. They invented
[0:51] things. to temper different metals and
[0:53] build houses and so forth. Scripture
[0:55] says so. And they were
[0:58] scoffers at the seat of the woman Noah
[1:02] the righteous. Is that right? Amen.
[1:05] Let's follow a little farther. There we
[1:07] go.
[3:47] They
[3:48] need the
[3:52] every most
[3:57] gracious Lord.

[12:04] I was thinking about this song all week
[12:08] and I was thinking about this pope that
[12:11] they just brought
[12:13] in. Y'all forgive me, but I wrote a
[12:16] little verse about it for this song cuz
[12:18] we This is manifestation, right? Can I
[12:22] sing it?
[12:24] Amen. Y'all hold on. Don't laugh. Okay,
[12:27] I'm not a songwriter, but look at this.
[12:30] Pope Leo has arrived as it was
[12:34] prophesied. God's telling his little
[12:37] bride she's going
[12:40] home. So run the race with patience and
[12:44] wait upon the Lord. Can't you see him?
[12:48] He's coming in for
[12:51] you. It's manifesting time. The fruits
[12:56] are on the vine and the lovely one is
[12:59] coming in
[13:02] you. You catch God's chosen bride.

[13:10] coming in with
[13:12] you. You know I would not be
[13:18] denied. No, I would not be denied.
[13:25] Till Jesus came and he made me whole, I
[13:31] would not
[13:35] be. When pain of
[13:38] death on my soul, unto my Lord I
[13:45] cry. Till Jesus came and he made me
[13:51] whole, I would not be
[13:56] denied. You know, I would not
[14:01] be. No, I would not
[14:07] be till Jesus came and he made me whole.
[14:14] I would not be
[14:18] denied as Jacob in the days
[14:23] alone. I wrestled with the
[14:29] Lord and stand with my
[14:34] car. I stood upon his word.
[14:41] I would not be
[14:44] denied. No, I would not be
[14:50] denied. If Jesus came and he made me
[14:56] whole, I would not be denied.
[15:02] For Satan said that my Lord was gone and
[15:08] he would not hear my
[15:12] prayer. But praise the
[15:17] Lord and Christ our Lord is
[15:22] near. You know I would not be denied.
[15:29] know I would not be
[15:34] denied till Jesus came and he made me
[15:39] whole. I would not be
[15:44] denied. You know I would not be
[15:49] denied. I know I would not
[15:55] be till Jesus came and he made me whole.
[16:02] I would not
[16:08] be. Amen. Amen. And
[16:11] amen. Amen.
[16:14] We can't be denied of this this truth as
[16:17] late as it is. Amen.

[18:01] is a
[18:03] place of
[18:05] perfect
[18:07] grace
[18:09] behind
[18:14] that.
[18:17] So little
[18:21] bright for
[18:23] all his way.
[18:30] Let's give him a clap offering this.
[18:39] Amen. If y'all could stand with me just
[18:42] for a minute. I don't have much to read
[18:43] this evening. Um, Brother Greg uh said,
[18:47] "Brother Sam greets the church this
[18:49] evening." Amen.
[18:51] Um, also as a as a prayer request,
[18:56] um, let's continue to remember Sister
[18:59] Pam and her family, uh, for the loss of
[19:01] their oldest son. Amen. Was just kind of
[19:04] heartbreaking to hear that. Um, so let's
[19:08] let's remember them in their time of
[19:09] grief. We're grieving as well. Amen.
[19:12] Because she's our sister and that's
[19:14] that's our family. Amen. Praise God.
[19:18] Brother Kimma, do you mind?
[19:21] Yes, ma'am.
[19:25] Yesterday.
[19:27] Yesterday.
[19:30] Amen.
[19:33] Amen. We did see that. Amen.
[19:37] Wonderful.
[19:40] Wonderful. Amen. Let's just bow our
[19:43] heads.
[19:45] Gracious heavenly father, we come before
[19:47] your throne of grace to give you thanks,
[19:50] oh God, for bringing us back into your
[19:52] house again. Dear Jesus, as brother John
[19:55] put a line about Leo, oh father God
[19:59] 14, your
[20:01] prophet spoke about the ecinical
[20:04] council, Father, way back in
[20:08] 1964 as he warned the people, do not go
[20:12] into there because it's the mark of the
[20:15] beast. Denominationalism or God will
[20:19] take you to hell. Oh dear Jesus, that
[20:22] was the birth of the ecumenical council.
[20:26] Lord, in all of these years, this system
[20:29] has become mature. Father God, she's
[20:32] become a a woman now, Father. Oh God,
[20:37] she's Oh, Father God, showing her
[20:39] muscles, oh Father, what she can do. And
[20:42] we see the manifestation thereof. But
[20:45] also on the other side, oh father, you
[20:47] sent the word, oh God, the breaking of
[20:50] those seals, oh father God, was the
[20:52] birth of your bride. Oh God, back then
[20:55] she was just a little girl growing. Oh
[20:57] God, also today she's become a fully
[21:00] mature woman. Dear Jesus, the battle of
[21:04] the women. Oh God, may you help us, oh
[21:07] father God, stand firm. Oh Lord, you say
[21:09] when that persecution come, let Leo
[21:11] come. Oh father, there's also Leo the
[21:14] lion, the lion of the tribe of Judah. Oh
[21:17] father God, who's roaring his word to
[21:19] your people. Father, that's the reason
[21:21] why we're learning about the tear and
[21:23] the wheat. Let them both grow together.
[21:25] And here we are, Father God, at harvest
[21:28] time. Oh Lord, you're harvesting your
[21:30] people, Father. You're binding them for
[21:33] the burning, oh God, by your putting us,
[21:35] Father God, and your gardener, Father.
[21:38] Oh dear Jesus, help us to mature by the
[21:40] word. Oh God, to cling close to thee, oh
[21:43] Father, as we see that day approaching,
[21:45] oh Father God, help us to get in our
[21:47] books and our tapes and our Bibles, oh
[21:49] Father, oh dear, to mature, to become
[21:53] men and women of God, oh Father,
[21:55] whatever Leo has in plan, you have a
[21:57] greater plan for us, Father, we thank
[22:00] you, Lord, for we see the end time
[22:02] before us. Lord, help us, oh God, oh
[22:06] dear Jesus, to love you even more day by
[22:08] day. Father, whatever we do, Lord God,
[22:12] look unto thee, Father, for the result,
[22:15] Lord, we want to remember our sister
[22:17] Pam, Lord God. I know how it is to lose
[22:20] a loved one, Father, but he's not lost.
[22:23] He's just in your presence, Lord,
[22:25] enjoying the blessings, oh Father God,
[22:27] he's gone to his reward, but it's hard
[22:30] on the body, Father. his heart on us, oh
[22:32] God, who are left behind. Let's take
[22:35] Father God, our sister tonight, Brother
[22:37] Andrew, Lord, the whole family. May you
[22:40] comfort them as you alone can, Father.
[22:43] Oh, dear Jesus, take care of the family,
[22:45] Father, and us also as a church. May you
[22:48] continue to bless us. We see the
[22:50] manifestation of our faith in the
[22:53] church, oh God. The building, how it's
[22:55] advancing, Father. May you continue to
[22:58] bless it, Lord, as we give the tithes
[23:00] and offering to thee, Father. May you
[23:02] multiply as you multiply the fish and
[23:05] the bread, oh Father God. And may you
[23:08] put something in the hands of the
[23:09] believers, oh Father, that they may be
[23:11] blessed for you. You said you love a
[23:13] cheerful giver. Bless our service as we
[23:15] continue. Do not forget Brother Seth, oh
[23:18] God, as he bring forth the word of life
[23:21] to your people, for that is the most
[23:23] important part of our service. May you
[23:25] take him out the way. Father, we have
[23:27] not come to see him, but we've come to
[23:29] hear from heaven. Your prophet said the
[23:32] gift is putting yourself to the side.
[23:34] May you help our brother tonight is my
[23:36] prayer. And we'll be careful to return
[23:38] glory and honor to you in Jesus name. In
[23:41] Jesus name.
[23:45] Amen. Amen. Y'all can be
[23:49] seated. We have one special tonight. Um,
[23:52] Sister Lily is going to come up and sing
[23:54] this evening and then we'll uh bring the
[23:56] pastor out. Amen.
[24:02] Um, if I could give just a brief
[24:05] testimony that I've been putting off for
[24:07] a while. Um, but I just want to share
[24:10] what the Lord has been doing for me. Um,
[24:13] and I'm praying that the Lord will help
[24:14] me make it short.
[24:16] Um, uh, I know brother Steven made an
[24:19] announcement about a month ago that I
[24:20] was having a procedure done. Um, and
[24:23] just to give some context so you'll kind
[24:25] of understand, I was pregnant for about
[24:27] eight weeks. Um, and I had two
[24:30] ultrasounds where kind of similar to the
[24:33] last one, they had told me they just
[24:34] didn't see anything. They just saw like
[24:36] the gestational sack but nothing inside
[24:39] and to prepare to have another
[24:41] miscarriage. And we were holding out,
[24:44] you know, hope of course and faith. Um,
[24:47] but the day after my second ultrasound,
[24:51] I had a doctor call me early that
[24:53] morning, a different one, saying, "I
[24:55] looked at your ultrasound and I'm really
[24:57] concerned because this is not a normal
[24:59] pregnancy at all. I am suspicious that
[25:02] this is a rare um pregnancy called a
[25:06] molar pregnancy." I had never heard of
[25:08] that before, but after some research and
[25:11] them kind of explaining essentially
[25:13] instead of, you know, a normal embryo
[25:15] being produced after conception, there's
[25:19] two types, a partial molar pregnancy and
[25:21] a complete partial, there's some DNA
[25:24] formed, but in my case, I had the more
[25:28] the one that had the higher likelihood
[25:30] of being more dangerous and actually
[25:32] cancerous. Um, essentially it instead of
[25:35] an embryo being conceived, it's just a
[25:37] massive tissue um with no DNA, but it
[25:40] instead of it being in your embryo like
[25:42] a one little jelly bean is, it was like
[25:45] a cluster of grapes. And so that's what
[25:48] um tipped him off. And he said, "We need
[25:50] to have surgery like immediately to get
[25:52] this out because it grows rapidly and
[25:54] it's if it's cancerous, it's really
[25:56] dangerous for you." And so this came as
[25:59] a shock. you know, we called brother
[26:00] Steven to get some answers. Um, and he
[26:04] told us just go ahead and schedule the
[26:05] surgery tomorrow. So, we had the
[26:07] surgery, everything went well and they
[26:09] had to have the surgery to test the
[26:11] tissue to see if it was a molar
[26:13] pregnancy and number two if it was
[26:15] cancerous. Um, so I recovered really,
[26:18] really well and they had to monitor my
[26:20] pregnancy hormone levels. I've been
[26:22] going every single week because if they
[26:25] don't drop or if they drop and come back
[26:27] up, that means I have to have another
[26:29] surgery and that means I didn't get all
[26:31] the tissue. And so my levels have been
[26:35] dropping really, really well over the
[26:36] last few weeks and I had my posttop and
[26:40] she told me that the tissue was not
[26:42] cancerous. So that's a blessing.
[26:46] Um, I don't I didn't really understand
[26:50] kind of the gravity of the situation
[26:53] until I joined a Facebook group with
[26:56] women that have also had this type of
[26:57] pregnancy to kind of understand more
[27:00] about it and understand other people's
[27:02] experiences of it. And that's when I
[27:04] realized like how much God actually did
[27:07] for me, how worse it could have been.
[27:10] Because with this type, I had the
[27:12] complete. So there was just no DNA. it
[27:14] was just tissue. There are so many women
[27:17] that have had the exact same one that
[27:18] has been dealing with
[27:21] chemotherapy, multiple surgeries, and
[27:23] dealing with infertility after that for
[27:25] years. So, I just want to praise the
[27:27] Lord for that.
[27:46] See my hands and look at my
[27:52] feet. It's okay if it's hard to
[27:59] believe. I have faith that you will
[28:04] do things.
[28:07] It's my time to
[28:10] go. But before I
[28:14] leave,
[28:16] so go tell the world about
[28:24] me. I was dead, but now I
[28:31] live. I've got to go now for a living.
[28:36] little
[28:40] while, but goodbye's not the
[28:46] end. Don't forget the things that I
[28:51] taught
[28:54] you. I've
[28:56] conered death and I hold the keys.
[29:03] Where I go, you will go to
[29:10] someday. But there's much to
[29:13] do here before you
[29:18] leave.
[29:20] So go tell the world about
[29:27] me. I was dead, but now I live.
[29:34] Oh, I've got to go now for a little
[29:41] while.
[29:43] But goodbye's not the end of the
[29:49] journey. The end of the
[29:52] road. My spirit is in you.
[29:57] Wherever you
[30:00] go, you have a
[30:03] purpose and I have a
[30:07] plan. I'll make you this promise. I'll
[30:12] come back
[30:14] again. But until
[30:19] then, go tell the world about me.
[30:28] I was dead, but now I live.

[38:31] Amen. Now, we shook that last demon out

[38:38] whatever. Now it's completely gone.
[38:40] Amen. Glory. Glory to God. Wonderful
[38:44] singing and wonderful testimony. Sister
[38:46] Lily God
[38:51] nothing. Nothing will take you out of
[38:54] this word until God has finished with
[38:58] you. Amen. No demon. There is nothing
[39:01] because God got a purpose. Amen. And
[39:04] that purpose will be fulfilled. Amen.
[39:08] Sometime he looks weary. Sometime he
[39:11] looks bad. Look at Lazarus.
[39:16] You see now? You see now? Look at
[39:18] Lazarus life now. Many souls came to
[39:22] Jesus Christ because of Lazarus.
[39:25] Lazarus showed the true color of Martyr.
[39:29] Amen. Now you know Martha because of
[39:32] Lazarus. That's right. Now they
[39:34] activated the prophecy for Jesus Christ
[39:36] because of Lazarus and Lazarus was the
[39:39] key to prepare those that needed to
[39:42] welcome Jesus Christ when he was
[39:45] entering Jerusalem.
[39:47] So the key was coming from Lazarus.
[39:49] That's why his
[39:51] death was for the glory of God. Amen.
[39:56] Amen. That's why everything
[40:00] everything
[40:02] is working together for good.
[40:09] Amen. Everything is working together.
[40:11] Anxiety should be completely gone from
[40:14] our life. You should be at peace knowing
[40:17] that God
[40:19] when you didn't know God, God was
[40:21] protecting you. when you didn't know
[40:24] God, everything was working together for
[40:26] good. Now that you know God with the
[40:29] opening of the seals, how much more
[40:32] should be?
[40:35] I don't know, my friend. I'm not looking
[40:36] at my trials. I'm now looking at what is
[40:39] going on, what the enemy is throwing
[40:40] left and right. When he shows something,
[40:42] I say, you know what? It's working
[40:44] together for good. Satan, whatever you
[40:47] bringing, these are ingredient. These
[40:49] are the fire God need. I was reading a
[40:52] work Psalm
[40:54] 105. The Bible says that it was God who
[40:57] sent Joseph to Egypt.
[41:01] You have seen that scripture. It's in
[41:03] Psalm 105. The Bible say he sent Joseph
[41:06] to Egypt.
[41:08] So for me and you, who sent Joseph to
[41:10] Egypt?
[41:12] No. Naturally, who sent Joseph to Egypt?
[41:17] His brother with hatred.
[41:21] saw them to Egypt. But when David picks
[41:23] up under the anointing, he say it was
[41:26] God that sent Joseph to Egypt because he
[41:29] needed to use that in order to bring him
[41:32] to his purpose. Not to kill you, but we
[41:35] have an expected end. The attribute of
[41:38] God, your purpose is so powerful that
[41:40] the devil can keep quiet.
[41:43] Amen. So your purpose is very great that
[41:47] Satan say uh I must be part of it
[41:52] and we're going to tell the story when
[41:54] we overcome and we will understand it
[41:57] better. How
[41:59] now you understand it better. Amen. We
[42:02] greet you all in the precious name of
[42:04] our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ both
[42:06] visible and invisible audience. Any
[42:09] family members here? God richly bless
[42:11] you and welcome to spoken word
[42:13] tabernacle on a Wednesday where we got
[42:15] our convention. Amen. Deaf in the body
[42:20] it's not easy. It's a separation.
[42:23] Brother Brandham say it's a separation
[42:25] in the body it's hard but the scriptures
[42:28] say when we sorrow as believer we do not
[42:31] sorrow like those that do not have hope.
[42:34] So believers sorrows differently because
[42:38] we know that there is a hope especially
[42:40] if you know how the person left. Amen.
[42:44] Hard in the body continue to pray for
[42:46] our sister but there is a great
[42:48] testimony behind that boy right there.
[42:52] Amen. He clean up everything
[42:56] before he went to be with the Lord.
[43:03] So you think God answer his prayer? God
[43:06] answer sister Pam's prayer.
[43:11] Now brother Alvin is more secure for
[43:14] sister Pam to see her than he was in
[43:17] this world.
[43:20] Clean up everything. Everything. Clean
[43:23] up here. Clean up. And at 7:00 in the
[43:25] morning before he passed away did the
[43:28] last clean up completely out and they
[43:31] change him and they put him in unit six
[43:34] but in room seven.
[43:40] Amen. And he told his father that I'm
[43:43] ready to go home
[43:48] and the pope from America is on the
[43:50] throne. So how long will it take to see
[43:52] him back?
[43:56] This is not the age of Paul. Where you
[43:59] waiting for Laisha? We are in the Laian
[44:02] age at the end of the age when we are
[44:05] ready for the rapture. So it won't be
[44:07] too long before we see our loved one.
[44:13] Amen. Amen. So you pray for the
[44:16] strength, but as far as where he is at,
[44:18] we at peace
[44:21] because we know exactly. And when you're
[44:23] going to see him, he's not going to look
[44:24] like that. He will look very young in a
[44:28] perfect body, more precious than that.
[44:30] And never to be separated. That's the
[44:33] hope of a Christian. Amen. So, continue
[44:36] to pray, continue to encourage, continue
[44:38] to stay and stick with us, sister. You
[44:40] already got the program. Everything was
[44:42] sent in the group chat. And God is
[44:44] working everything together for good.
[44:48] Amen. Amen. what seems to be dark right
[44:52] now, you will see what God is doing
[44:53] behind the scene. Amen. So, keep praying
[44:56] and all is well by God's grace.
[44:58] Hallelujah. I'm not preaching tonight.
[45:02] Brother Set is preaching. Keep praying
[45:04] for the building. We need some faith and
[45:07] we need some works.
[45:13] The good news about spoken word is you
[45:15] can read between the lines. So I so I
[45:18] don't have to elaborate a lot. Amen. So
[45:22] I'm in a middle of left things going
[45:25] left and right left and we moving and
[45:28] it's uh it's coming up beautiful. Amen.
[45:32] At the end the product is coming up
[45:33] good. But remember faith without work
[45:39] dead my friend. Right S. Faith without
[45:43] work is what? So remember remember I'm
[45:46] talking on behalf of the trustee. Amen.
[45:50] He he's working. It's unbelievable the
[45:54] way he's operating. I don't even know
[45:55] how he's doing this working staying on
[45:58] top of everything and coming and he's
[46:00] he's leading the song. He's I I don't
[46:03] know. Ask brother Robert and the deacon
[46:04] will tell you how he's operating. It's
[46:06] unbel It's a miracle the way he's
[46:09] coordinating everything. It is a mirror.
[46:11] I'm I'm I'm even discovering his other
[46:14] side of strength that we never seen
[46:17] before and therefore you won't get him
[46:21] because he's under the blood. Amen. So
[46:25] pray and then remember the building. All
[46:28] is well by God's grace. Let's go. Only
[46:30] believe.

[56:34] that it is time for us to manifest.
[56:37] Amen. It is a homegoing time. Amen. So,

[57:03] You remember he's both king and priest.
[57:06] So bring the lion. That spirit is able
[57:09] to conquer that lion.
[57:12] There was one time,
[57:15] there was one time a prophet was given a
[57:18] mission to go to talk to Jeroboam who
[57:22] was a wicked king, right? He went to
[57:25] manifest that God gave him specific
[57:27] instructions, but he swed away from it.
[57:31] And guess what? the lion. God prove that
[57:35] when something gets into
[57:39] iniquity, oh my goodness, when something
[57:42] gets out of line of the word, we have
[57:44] the lion, that consuming fire, that

[59:12] Hosea chapter 4 verse
[59:15] 6. It said, "My people are

[59:21] right. Amen.
[59:22] Because thou has rejected knowledge, I
[59:26] will also reject thee, that thou shalt
[59:29] be no priest to me. Seeing thou has
[59:34] forgotten the law of thy God, I will
[59:37] also forget thy children. May the Lord
[59:39] add his blessing to the reading of the
[59:41] word. Amen. Can you be seated tonight?
[59:44] Amen. Amen.
[59:46] So um the prophet says something. We can
[59:49] take scripture and look at it from so
[59:51] many angles
[59:53] and I know um the pastor have been
[59:56] dealing with with us with uh Hosea 4:6.
[59:59] Amen. I want to turn another angle to
[1:00:02] this. Amen. Amen. So my my title tonight
[1:00:08] is for lack of knowledge.
[1:00:11] Amen. For lack of knowledge. Bible said
[1:00:15] that for lack my people are destroyed.
[1:00:18] That's right. For lack of knowledge. Now
[1:00:21] we we look at knowledge in so many
[1:00:23] aspect or so many areas. Let's say
[1:00:26] somebody I just want to take brother
[1:00:28] Zach as an example as I'm seeing work
[1:00:31] in. Amen. So if we're talking about
[1:00:35] knowledge in HVAC
[1:00:38] Amen you would you would have to learn
[1:00:43] it. Amen. You've have to learn it to
[1:00:45] gain all those information. Amen. To be
[1:00:49] able to operate the the the HVAC machine
[1:00:52] or or whatever device that is connected
[1:00:55] to that. Amen. So when you don't have
[1:00:58] that information, you can't deal with
[1:01:01] anything that comes with HVAC. That's
[1:01:03] right. Let's say somebody who is a
[1:01:06] mechanic or somebody who works with
[1:01:08] vehicles. Amen.
[1:01:10] That person has to go through training.
[1:01:12] Amen. To be able to handle the fixing of
[1:01:15] a vehicle. That's right. So, let's say
[1:01:18] you give it to somebody who has no
[1:01:21] knowledge about trying to fix the car.
[1:01:24] Sometimes we take our cars to mechanics
[1:01:26] and we want to be sure that this
[1:01:29] mechanic is well experienced enough to
[1:01:32] be able to handle whatever situation is
[1:01:36] happening to the car. Amen.
[1:01:39] So what I'm trying to say is that when
[1:01:42] we don't have knowledge about
[1:01:45] something, we might end up destroying
[1:01:48] something. Amen. When we have been given
[1:01:51] something to handle and we don't have no
[1:01:54] knowledge about it, we end up in in in
[1:01:58] destruction. Amen. Now the the the book
[1:02:02] of John, can we go to John chapter 8
[1:02:05] verse 32?
[1:02:09] Amen. John chapter 8 verse 32. Amen.
[1:02:13] Amen. Amen.
[1:02:18] Amen.
[1:02:20] I had I had wanted to take uh the team
[1:02:23] tonight to be the silent weapon of God's
[1:02:26] secrecy. Amen. But then whilst whilst I
[1:02:30] was working on that, God had to start
[1:02:32] this for lack of knowledge. Amen. God
[1:02:36] has a weapon of secrecy. Amen. That the
[1:02:39] devil has no knowledge about. Amen. So
[1:02:44] God God just moved me to this portion so
[1:02:48] we can deal with that and next time we
[1:02:50] go onto that. Amen. God's silent weapon
[1:02:53] of secrecy. Amen. So we read John
[1:02:56] chapter 8 verse 32. Yes sir. Amen.
[1:03:01] John chapter
[1:03:03] 8 verse 32.
[1:03:07] Amen.
[1:03:09] He said, "And ye shall know the truth."
[1:03:12] That's right. And the truth shall make
[1:03:14] you free. That's right. Amen. So we see
[1:03:18] that lack of knowledge gets us into
[1:03:21] destruction. That's right. But then when
[1:03:23] we have the truth, the truth will make
[1:03:26] us free. That's right. In other words,
[1:03:29] the truth is a source of knowledge or
[1:03:32] the truth is given to us as a basis of
[1:03:35] knowledge to be able to get us free from
[1:03:39] any kind of bondage from any kind of
[1:03:42] situation that we are in. Amen. Amen.
[1:03:45] Now we want to take Proverbs chapter
[1:03:48] 9:10.
[1:03:51] Proverbs
[1:03:53] 9:10. Trying to build this foundation
[1:03:55] here. Amen. Proverbs 9 verse 10.
[1:04:07] Proverbs 9:E
[1:04:09] 10 it says the fear of the Lord is the
[1:04:14] beginning of wisdom.
[1:04:17] The beginning of wisdom
[1:04:19] and the knowledge of the holy is
[1:04:22] understanding.
[1:04:24] So we we we see right here
[1:04:27] that having fear for God begins
[1:04:32] something we call wisdom.
[1:04:34] Amen. And and with the holy or the
[1:04:38] children of God, understanding is very
[1:04:41] important because it builds up knowledge
[1:04:44] in our lives. So the beginning of wisdom
[1:04:50] is connected to the fear of God. That's
[1:04:52] right. Amen. So let's have that in mind.
[1:04:56] Let's read Amos 3 6
[1:05:00] to8. Amos 3 6 to
[1:05:07] 8. So after Hosea we have Joah and then
[1:05:11] we have Amos. Amos chapter 3 verse 6
[1:05:15] to8.
[1:05:23] If we are there, we say amen. Amen. The
[1:05:26] Bible said, "Shall a trumpet be blown in
[1:05:30] the city and the people not be
[1:05:33] afraid." So the word here is afraid of
[1:05:37] fear. Shall there be evil in a city and
[1:05:40] the Lord have not done it?
[1:05:44] So he said, "Surely the Lord God will do
[1:05:47] nothing, but he revealth his secret unto
[1:05:52] his servants, the prophets."
[1:05:54] So the prophets come here. Amen. And it
[1:05:57] says something here. It said, "The lion
[1:06:00] has roared."
[1:06:02] Who will not fear?
[1:06:08] So the prophets are connected to
[1:06:10] something we call fear.
[1:06:13] And remember that the Bible said the
[1:06:16] fear of the Lord is the beginning
[1:06:19] of wisdom.
[1:06:23] So it means to begin the walk with
[1:06:27] Christ, we must get connected to the
[1:06:30] prophetic. That's right.
[1:06:33] To begin your walk with Christ, it must
[1:06:37] be connected to the prophetic.
[1:06:40] Amen. I'm going to read
[1:06:43] from what the prophet has said.
[1:06:47] This is in God's power to
[1:06:50] transform. Amen. Paragraph
[1:06:55] 208. Preach in 1965. He said, "It seems
[1:06:59] that people has lost their common
[1:07:02] decency and modesty." That's right. They
[1:07:05] are not like they used to be. Uh-huh. It
[1:07:08] used to be when the prophet said, "Thus
[1:07:11] said the Lord, the people trembled."
[1:07:16] Yes, sir. Amen.
[1:07:19] Amen. Amen. It said, "Yeah, they
[1:07:21] certainly did. The people moved for they
[1:07:26] was afraid,
[1:07:28] but now they lost all their scare of
[1:07:32] it." That's right. They don't fear God.
[1:07:36] So when the death se the Lord comes and
[1:07:40] we do not fear that it means we are not
[1:07:43] fearing God. So you remember that the
[1:07:47] beginning of the walk with God has to
[1:07:50] start with the fear. Amen. Amen. So it
[1:07:54] takes the prophetic to even start a
[1:07:57] walking with God.
[1:08:00] So say Solomon said the fear of God is
[1:08:02] the beginning of wisdom. The prophet
[1:08:05] said just the beginning of it.
[1:08:08] Amen. Just the beginning. So I can
[1:08:11] imagine how how many people have not
[1:08:14] even begun the work with God
[1:08:18] because it has to be connected to the
[1:08:20] prophetic.
[1:08:22] Amen. Amen. It said but the prophet can
[1:08:25] speak that say the Lord. People say
[1:08:28] nonsense.
[1:08:32] My God. My God. Amen.
[1:08:35] So we have courts after courts being
[1:08:39] preached on the pulpit.
[1:08:41] You don't say nonsense by your mouth.
[1:08:46] Amen. But you say nonsense by your
[1:08:50] actions.
[1:08:52] Amen. So when the prophet says something
[1:08:56] and you are doing contrary in your
[1:08:58] heart, you are saying nonsense to God.
[1:09:02] Yes sir. Amen. You have not begun your
[1:09:06] work yet.
[1:09:11] It's a people say nonsense. See there is
[1:09:13] not a hope for them.
[1:09:17] It's it's they say why we are
[1:09:21] smart. We are
[1:09:23] intellectual. We don't have to take that
[1:09:25] kind of stuff. We know that we are talk.
[1:09:28] We know what we are talking about.
[1:09:32] So the smartness of men, amen, try to
[1:09:37] oppose the that say the Lord. That is
[1:09:40] why they call it nonsense in their
[1:09:43] heart.
[1:09:45] Amen. So when you when you kind of um
[1:09:49] just to illustrate it when you kind of
[1:09:51] know something in your life, right? You
[1:09:54] understanding concept to you, you know
[1:09:56] it, right? and then somebody else comes
[1:10:00] and then does something that you think
[1:10:02] is not right. How is your reaction going
[1:10:05] to be like?
[1:10:08] Excuse me to say you might say that is
[1:10:09] rubbish, right? Yep. Exactly. So your
[1:10:14] action shows that okay um that is that
[1:10:17] is a lot of garbage, right? You didn't
[1:10:19] say it by your mouth, but the actions
[1:10:22] show that you are saying that's a lot of
[1:10:25] garbage. Amen.
[1:10:27] So when the prophet says something and
[1:10:30] then we do contrary what we are trying
[1:10:33] to say is that that is garbage to me.
[1:10:36] Because if something is precious to you,
[1:10:39] you are definitely going to treat it
[1:10:41] right. Something that is precious to
[1:10:43] you, you might wake up in the morning,
[1:10:45] take it, clean it up, you're always
[1:10:47] looking at it, you're always watching
[1:10:49] it, you make sure that everything is
[1:10:51] right with it because it's precious to
[1:10:53] you. But if it's not precious to you,
[1:10:56] Amen. Where does it end up? It end up in
[1:11:00] the garbage bin. Right. Exactly.
[1:11:08] So, so it ends up in the trash can.
[1:11:11] Amen.
[1:11:13] So, what are we saying tonight? Amen.
[1:11:16] Our work has not even begun when we take
[1:11:21] away the dia the law from the pulpit.
[1:11:24] Our work with Christ has not even begun
[1:11:28] when we take away the message of the
[1:11:31] hour from the pulpit and is is being
[1:11:35] replaced by our creeds. Now what is a
[1:11:39] creed?
[1:11:41] A creed starts like an idea in your
[1:11:44] mind. That's right. Because that's what
[1:11:46] the prophet said. It was just a saying.
[1:11:49] That's right. And then it became it it
[1:11:52] went on to become something that the
[1:11:54] people were doing and then doctrine.
[1:11:57] Exactly. And then it it gets into the
[1:12:00] lives of the people. Now it becomes a
[1:12:02] man that is walking. Amen. So we develop
[1:12:06] our own creeds by our own intellectual
[1:12:10] understanding of of of what we think
[1:12:12] it's supposed to be. Amen. Amen. So
[1:12:16] creeds are not just literally things
[1:12:19] that that were written just like you go
[1:12:21] to u the Roman Catholic churches and um
[1:12:24] some of us who came from the
[1:12:25] Presbyterian churches we have a bunch of
[1:12:28] creeds that you have to recite and all
[1:12:30] those stuff. Amen. It started as an
[1:12:33] idea. So you can be sitting in church
[1:12:36] once the word comes and you have your
[1:12:39] own creed in your mind because your
[1:12:42] thinking is contrary to what is coming
[1:12:44] out. Amen.
[1:12:48] Go ahead brother. So the last time we
[1:12:50] talked about u the power of remembrance,
[1:12:53] right? And and we can we can recollect
[1:12:58] that the prophet made us to understand
[1:13:01] clearly that when God makes an oath or
[1:13:06] when God says something, he watches over
[1:13:09] that word. Amen. And because we are
[1:13:12] under spiritual amnesia. Amen. The
[1:13:16] spirit of God or the Holy Ghost has been
[1:13:18] sent to bring to remembrance the things
[1:13:21] that he has said before or the things
[1:13:24] that he prophesied. Amen. And remember
[1:13:26] that one form of remembrance is that he
[1:13:29] comes to manifest what he said just to
[1:13:32] prove to you that what he said is the
[1:13:35] truth.
[1:13:36] Amen. Yes, sir. So, so, so as as the
[1:13:39] prophet said, we must be under teaching
[1:13:43] because when the spirit of God speaks
[1:13:45] something, he comes to illustrate to us
[1:13:48] to really understand what he was talking
[1:13:50] about. Amen. Amen. So now, so now this
[1:13:55] is the thing. God doesn't hide the truth
[1:13:57] from the chosen.
[1:14:01] God will never hide the truth from the
[1:14:04] chosen. Why? Because to begin with, the
[1:14:08] truth was part of the chosen. Before you
[1:14:11] were born, the truth was already part of
[1:14:14] you. The truth was already in you. So
[1:14:18] you were just born as a child just like
[1:14:21] an adoption. Amen. You were born as a
[1:14:24] baby to be trained to know exactly what
[1:14:27] your inheritance was. Amen. Amen. So it
[1:14:31] I it is really important that you go
[1:14:33] under training or under teaching just to
[1:14:36] understand what you've been made for.
[1:14:39] Amen. Amen. We want to we want to take
[1:14:43] this from the message the faith of
[1:14:45] Abraham.
[1:14:47] Amen.
[1:14:49] God doesn't hide anything from the
[1:14:51] chosen.
[1:14:53] That is why that is why it's important
[1:14:56] for him to bring that knowledge to you.
[1:15:00] So when you reject knowledge,
[1:15:04] Amen. you are rejecting God.
[1:15:08] Amen. So you get to the point where you
[1:15:11] are getting destroyed. Amen. Things are
[1:15:14] happening. Prophecies are being
[1:15:16] fulfilled and people have no idea what
[1:15:18] is going on. But to the bride, we have
[1:15:22] that knowledge. Amen. And when we see
[1:15:24] that happen, we know what time it is.
[1:15:27] Amen.
[1:15:28] When when when Daniel Amen got to a
[1:15:31] point where he calculated the time and
[1:15:34] he realized that it was 68 years. Amen.
[1:15:37] How did he know it was 68 years? He
[1:15:39] already had a knowledge. Amen. From the
[1:15:42] prophecy of Jeremiah. Amen. So when the
[1:15:45] time came, he had to take action. Amen.
[1:15:48] To go and pray. Amen. Amen. Knowledge
[1:15:52] puts us to action. Especially when the
[1:15:55] time is at end. That's right. Amen. So
[1:15:59] the faith of Abraham, Amen, preaching
[1:16:02] 55, Amen. He said, and predestination is
[1:16:05] a hard word among a congregation of
[1:16:07] people. Because predestination, the
[1:16:10] prophet really fornowledge is a better
[1:16:13] word. He said, and predestination looks
[1:16:16] back to fornowledge
[1:16:18] and fornowledge looks onto destiny.
[1:16:21] That's right.
[1:16:23] Amen.
[1:16:24] So before destiny happens, there is
[1:16:28] fornowledge.
[1:16:31] As long as there is fornowledge, there
[1:16:33] is an assurance of destiny.
[1:16:36] So wherever God has made us to or
[1:16:39] whatever he has prepared us to get to,
[1:16:43] there is an assurance because there was
[1:16:45] a fornowledge.
[1:16:47] God looks back to the forn knowledge and
[1:16:49] the fornowledge points him to the
[1:16:52] destination. Amen. Amen. So when God is
[1:16:55] looking at you, he the picture takes him
[1:16:58] back to the forn knowledge. Amen. That
[1:17:01] is why the spirit of God is such that he
[1:17:05] wants people to be saved. Amen. But by
[1:17:08] knowledge, Amen. He knows that they
[1:17:11] can't be saved. Amen. Because for
[1:17:13] knowledge takes him back to the picture
[1:17:16] of how it was from the beginning. Amen.
[1:17:19] And then that for knowledge points him
[1:17:21] back to the destination.
[1:17:24] Amen. So it said, "And for knowledge
[1:17:27] looks unto destiny,
[1:17:29] that God being infinite in the beginning
[1:17:33] knew the end from the beginning." That's
[1:17:35] right. Therefore, he knew what people
[1:17:39] would do. That's right. So he could
[1:17:42] foretell what would take place. That's
[1:17:44] right. For he knew what would be. That's
[1:17:47] right. Amen.
[1:17:49] So when God comes with that say the
[1:17:51] Lord, he already knew it from the
[1:17:53] beginning and he knew what the ending
[1:17:56] was going to be. Amen. That is why the
[1:17:59] sea the Lord is as sure as it is. Amen.
[1:18:03] So when the Lord comes and said thus say
[1:18:05] the Lord, there is an assurance. Amen.
[1:18:08] When the Lord said thus say the Lord,
[1:18:10] there's coming a bride, a prophet bride
[1:18:13] that is going to conquer whatever Laisa
[1:18:16] brings to in in this dispensation, it is
[1:18:19] that said the Lord and that's an
[1:18:21] assurance that it is going to happen.
[1:18:24] Amen. Amen. So when he said when the
[1:18:27] squeeze come, watch the third pull
[1:18:30] unfold. That is the dust say the Lord.
[1:18:32] The Lord already saw it from the
[1:18:34] beginning. So now that we are seeing
[1:18:36] prophecy fulfilled, there is an
[1:18:39] assurance that that pool shall come into
[1:18:42] full effect. Amen.
[1:18:47] Amen.
[1:18:52] Thank you, Lord. So paragraph 20, it
[1:18:54] says, "Therefore he by election he chose
[1:18:58] Abraham." That's right. For he knew what
[1:19:01] Abraham would do. That's right.
[1:19:03] He knew what he will do. Amen. Before he
[1:19:06] came to him. So when the Lord comes to
[1:19:09] you, he knows that he knew what you were
[1:19:12] going to do. But so many times we look
[1:19:15] at ourselves, our situation and and how
[1:19:18] the current condition is. Amen. But God
[1:19:22] knew that was exactly. Amen. The story
[1:19:26] of Gideon. Amen. When God came, he said,
[1:19:29] "Mighty man of hell." Amen. He already
[1:19:31] knew who he was. Amen. Before he came to
[1:19:34] him, Amen. If he were not to be a mighty
[1:19:36] man of valor, Amen. God wouldn't have
[1:19:39] come to him. And and and and and the
[1:19:41] same thing with Mary. Amen.
[1:19:44] Amen. If God didn't know what she was,
[1:19:48] he wouldn't have sent the angel to to
[1:19:50] her. Amen.
[1:19:52] So, if God didn't know the bride in this
[1:19:55] last age, he wouldn't have sent us a
[1:19:57] prophet.
[1:19:59] God knows exactly what the bride is. and
[1:20:02] what the bride will do. That is why he
[1:20:04] came to us in this last age.
[1:20:08] Amen. And so you remember when he called
[1:20:11] him out there and said he not keep the
[1:20:15] thing a secret from him.
[1:20:20] When he called him, he said he's not
[1:20:22] going to keep it a secret from him
[1:20:24] because he was a chosen.
[1:20:27] That is why the deeper secret of God is
[1:20:31] for the bride.
[1:20:33] It is not for anybody. That is why the
[1:20:36] devil can lo lay hold on that because it
[1:20:40] is not for the children of predition. It
[1:20:43] is a secret for the bride. That is why
[1:20:46] he uses that to confuse the enemy. The
[1:20:49] enemy cannot get to revelation because
[1:20:52] revelation is a secret that has been
[1:20:54] revealed. Amen.
[1:20:56] only to the bride.
[1:20:59] Why? There's a content of faith in the
[1:21:02] bride that can connect to revelation.
[1:21:05] Anytime revelation comes, it is bubbling
[1:21:07] in you. Amen. That that is exactly the
[1:21:11] truth. Amen. And it's only the pride
[1:21:13] that can take that.
[1:21:15] Amen.
[1:21:17] When he was going down to destroy Sodom
[1:21:19] and Gomorrah, he said, "For I know that
[1:21:22] Abraham will teach his children
[1:21:26] I know it. God himself. I know that
[1:21:29] Abraham will send this message on down
[1:21:33] from one to the other generation.
[1:21:38] So when God called the bride in this
[1:21:40] last age, he knows that we are children,
[1:21:44] spiritual children of Abraham. Amen. The
[1:21:46] royal seed of Abraham. And he knows that
[1:21:49] when he brings the message to you, your
[1:21:53] children are also going to hear about
[1:21:55] it. The generations after them are also
[1:21:58] going to hear about it. God has an
[1:22:00] assurance that when he brings a message
[1:22:03] to you, it is going to be handed down to
[1:22:06] generations to come.
[1:22:09] That is why there is an assurance that
[1:22:12] our children can never be lost
[1:22:15] regardless of the situation, regardless
[1:22:19] of the condition. And we can hear the
[1:22:21] testimony of Sister P tonight. Amen. He
[1:22:25] gave that testimony. He said her child
[1:22:28] will never be lost. And we can see it
[1:22:31] manifest today. And we just say glory be
[1:22:34] to God. Glory. Hallelujah. Amen. And
[1:22:37] amen. Amen. Amen.
[1:22:41] Hallelujah.
[1:22:43] Amen. Yes, sir. Hallelujah. Amen. It
[1:22:46] said, "But God knowing that and knowing
[1:22:49] that Abraham would do it, then he told
[1:22:52] Abraham in the beginning that he will
[1:22:55] save him and save his seed after him."
[1:22:58] So God said he knew Abraham would do it.
[1:23:02] He knew that a time will come that he
[1:23:04] was going to test Abraham. Amen. To
[1:23:08] offer his son. That's right. God knew
[1:23:10] all that. Amen. That's why he came to
[1:23:12] him and brought him the test. So when
[1:23:16] God brings a test to you, he knows that
[1:23:19] you are going to overcome. That was why
[1:23:21] he brought it to you because you are
[1:23:23] chosen. You are a seed. Amen. You have
[1:23:27] already overcome. Amen. That was why he
[1:23:29] came to you with a test. Amen. Amen. And
[1:23:32] amen. Amen. Amen. Amen.
[1:23:38] Praise the Lord. Amen. So say Abraham in
[1:23:41] the beginning that he would save him and
[1:23:42] save his seed after him and will give
[1:23:45] him the unconditional covenant that he
[1:23:48] made with Abraham. Not because Abraham
[1:23:51] was good,
[1:23:53] but because God was good.
[1:23:57] Amen. Not because you and I are good in
[1:24:01] our flesh, but because God is good. And
[1:24:05] he said, I have said that ye are God's.
[1:24:10] Hallelujah.
[1:24:12] Amen.
[1:24:13] So he God is good and he God is going to
[1:24:18] make sure that goodness manifest and
[1:24:22] overcome every challenge of this flesh.
[1:24:28] Amen. Not because you were good, but
[1:24:31] because God was good. Amen. And God
[1:24:34] comes to God. Amen. God is not coming to
[1:24:37] your flesh. He's coming to the God in
[1:24:39] you because he sees the goodness in you.
[1:24:43] Amen. So we sing the goodness of God.
[1:24:47] Amen. Amen. The goodness of God when we
[1:24:51] sing it, it is in our soul. Amen. The
[1:24:54] goodness of God is moving everywhere we
[1:24:57] go to. Amen. So we just proclaim him.
[1:25:00] Amen. He is the goodness, oh God, in us.
[1:25:04] Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:25:06] Amen. And amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen.
[1:25:15] Amen.
[1:25:16] The faith of Abraham. Amen. Continue.
[1:25:18] and said, "And every believer in here is
[1:25:21] a Christian tonight
[1:25:23] because not that you are good, but
[1:25:27] because God was good to call you."
[1:25:31] God was good to call you. So God is call
[1:25:36] God who is good is calling you who is
[1:25:39] good.
[1:25:40] So good cause unto good. Amen. Amen. A
[1:25:45] good to respond. Ah, they got to be a
[1:25:48] good to respond. So I see a good call
[1:25:51] brother Greg. I see a good call sister
[1:25:54] Cindy. I see a good called brother
[1:25:56] Michael. I see a good call brother
[1:25:59] Khalma. I see a good Amen. So we sit
[1:26:02] down here and it's a bunch of goods.
[1:26:05] Amen. That is that is sitting and
[1:26:08] rejoicing to the mama good that is
[1:26:11] coming to us. Hallelujah.
[1:26:14] Amen and amen. Amen. Amen. He said you
[1:26:19] couldn't come yourself.
[1:26:22] Your nature is against you
[1:26:25] because because there has to be a good
[1:26:27] to connect to the good. Amen. Your
[1:26:30] nature is against that good. You
[1:26:32] couldn't come yourself. It was God in
[1:26:35] you that came to meet God. That is why
[1:26:38] when we meet him in the air, we shall be
[1:26:41] like him. Amen. Because you see a good
[1:26:44] connecting to a good. Hallelujah.
[1:26:48] Amen. Amen. They say you just couldn't
[1:26:52] you just couldn't as I said the other
[1:26:54] night make a pig believe he's wrong
[1:26:57] eating slop because it's his nature.
[1:27:00] Amen. See now the only said a leopard
[1:27:04] could not change his spot. No matter how
[1:27:07] bad he would lick, he'd only brighten
[1:27:11] it.
[1:27:14] Amen. Amen. It's a nature in there. So
[1:27:19] the spots are there. So he he's trying
[1:27:22] to take it out. Licking it. Licking it.
[1:27:24] But rather is actually showing more
[1:27:26] spot. It's becoming a clearer spot.
[1:27:29] Amen. Just to tell you your flesh can do
[1:27:33] nothing. Amen. Amen. Our flesh can do
[1:27:36] nothing. When we try to go by the way of
[1:27:40] our flesh, we rather we rather project
[1:27:43] sin the more. But when we connect to the
[1:27:46] inner man, Amen. that inner man is able
[1:27:48] to consume the desires of the flesh.
[1:27:53] Amen.
[1:27:56] Hallelujah. And said, and you don't want
[1:27:58] reformation.
[1:28:01] That that's why the reformers couldn't
[1:28:03] overcome sin.
[1:28:05] It has to take an eagle eye that can
[1:28:09] look to the inside and see where the
[1:28:12] problem was. Amen. To change you from
[1:28:15] the inside,
[1:28:17] inside out. Amen. So now the inside
[1:28:20] comes to consume the outside.
[1:28:23] Amen.
[1:28:24] Hallelujah.
[1:28:26] Amen. Amen. Yes sir. He said you got to
[1:28:29] be completely
[1:28:31] changed completely inside and the nature
[1:28:34] come from within. Amen. And it will work
[1:28:37] out. That's right. The prophet said it
[1:28:40] will work out.
[1:28:42] Regardless of whatever, regardless of
[1:28:45] the spot, regardless of how bad it is,
[1:28:48] it will work out. Even if it takes the
[1:28:52] last day on the hospital bed, it will
[1:28:54] work out. Amen. We proclaim that upon
[1:28:58] our families. Amen. It will surely work
[1:29:01] out. Hallelujah.
[1:29:04] Amen. Amen. It's said by getting it
[1:29:08] right inside at the beginning.
[1:29:11] Amen. At the beginning. That is why it's
[1:29:14] very important to connect to the
[1:29:16] prophetic from the beginning. Because
[1:29:19] the beginning has to be right. The
[1:29:22] prophetic brings you to how you have to
[1:29:24] get baptized. Amen. The prophetic brings
[1:29:27] to you how you have to receive the Holy
[1:29:30] Ghost, how we conduct ourselves, how we
[1:29:33] have to dress, how we have to do things
[1:29:36] in the church. So we must start from the
[1:29:40] beginning.
[1:29:43] I said and you and you begin with a soul
[1:29:47] before the world was ever formed.
[1:29:50] Amen. Amen. So from the beginning, God
[1:29:53] had already worked out what he was going
[1:29:56] to manifest in you.
[1:29:58] Amen. He said when God created man in
[1:30:01] his own image. Amen. Now you got to get
[1:30:04] that right. And that's what has to be
[1:30:06] born again. Not your thinking. It takes
[1:30:10] care it. It moves with this. But get
[1:30:14] this right. And this will be all right
[1:30:17] too if you just get your heart right.
[1:30:20] Your
[1:30:21] intellectuals will move right with it.
[1:30:25] If you get your heart right, your
[1:30:27] intellectuals will move right with it.
[1:30:30] Because the power is on the inside. The
[1:30:34] inside power is greater than what is
[1:30:36] outside. The Bible said greater is he
[1:30:39] that is in me than who is in the world.
[1:30:41] Amen. So that greater person in me
[1:30:45] overcomes whoever is outside or the
[1:30:48] outward man.
[1:30:50] Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. Amen. Now from
[1:30:55] this message, Amen. I try to be watching
[1:30:58] my time. Amen. He said, sir, we will see
[1:31:01] Jesus. Amen. Preaching 60 1960 paragraph
[1:31:06] of 171. He said, "But watch this one
[1:31:10] that stayed with Abraham."
[1:31:12] Now close. We are fixing to close in a
[1:31:15] minute, but um we have a little time.
[1:31:18] Amen.
[1:31:20] Amen. He said, "Watch Jesus. What he
[1:31:23] said will be in the last day." That's
[1:31:26] the church nominal getting their message
[1:31:30] for Billy Graham and many of the great
[1:31:33] men has swept the earth with it. The
[1:31:37] church
[1:31:38] spiritual has to get their message in
[1:31:41] the last days.
[1:31:43] So once we see the fulfillment on the on
[1:31:46] one side, you also see the fulfillment
[1:31:49] on the other side. Amen. Once we see
[1:31:53] prophecy being fulfilled on one side, we
[1:31:56] must also see prophecy fulfilled on the
[1:32:00] other side. Hallelujah.
[1:32:03] Hallelujah.
[1:32:05] So when we see when the time is coming
[1:32:08] that the spirit of the devil is going to
[1:32:10] be incarnate in man, God sent a message
[1:32:14] to the church. He said ye are gods. Ye
[1:32:17] are gods. I said ye are gods. Remember
[1:32:20] God has to be incarnate in man. That is
[1:32:22] why he sent the capstone ministry. The
[1:32:26] capstone ministry is the fullness of
[1:32:28] Christ. The unveiling of Christ in in
[1:32:32] the body of flesh.
[1:32:34] Hallelujah.
[1:32:36] That is our promise. Amen. Yes, sir.
[1:32:40] Amen. And amen.
[1:32:42] We don't care how it's going to happen.
[1:32:44] Amen. Just like how the the prophet was
[1:32:47] moving with this brother with with that
[1:32:50] silver tip bear. Amen. They they were
[1:32:52] getting closer, getting closer, getting
[1:32:55] closer, getting closer. And it got to
[1:32:58] the point the brother was like, "Oh,
[1:33:00] brother Abraham, are you really sure
[1:33:02] about this?" The prophet had a key.
[1:33:05] Amen. He had a key to the door. The
[1:33:07] prophet said when God shows you a
[1:33:09] vision, he has he has shown you the key.
[1:33:12] Amen. And nothing can take it away from
[1:33:14] you. So the prophet had that key. Amen.
[1:33:17] So while he were moving on was it looks
[1:33:21] impossible. Sometimes we think how are
[1:33:23] we going to be speaking things into
[1:33:26] existence when that squeeze come. But as
[1:33:29] we are getting closer, getting closer,
[1:33:31] it is a promise of God when we get to
[1:33:34] 500 years out. Amen. It to get to that
[1:33:38] point that we begin to see the
[1:33:40] manifestation of what was promised.
[1:33:46] Hallelujah.
[1:33:48] Hallelujah.
[1:33:50] The church spiritual has to get their
[1:33:53] message in the last days cuz Jesus said
[1:33:56] as it was in that day so shall he be. He
[1:34:01] said watch this angel how he acts of
[1:34:04] this man. Hallelujah.
[1:34:07] He had his back turned to the tent and
[1:34:10] he said Abraham where is your wife
[1:34:13] Sarah? Amen. He came to prove to the
[1:34:16] church,
[1:34:18] God in flesh, and we are promised that
[1:34:21] in this last age. Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:34:25] Yes sir. God incarnate. That is the
[1:34:29] capstone revelation of the Lord Jesus
[1:34:32] Christ. That is the ministry that is
[1:34:35] promised the bride in this last age.
[1:34:38] Hallelujah. We've seen a sign in a
[1:34:41] prophet called brother Brham. Amen. that
[1:34:44] he turned his back just to prove
[1:34:48] hallelujah God in flesh. There is a
[1:34:51] promise to the bride that there's coming
[1:34:53] a time that you speak things into
[1:34:56] existence. You speak things Amen to
[1:34:59] change your situation. Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:35:07] Yes sir. Amen. He said,"Abraham, seeing
[1:35:10] that you are an heir of the world, I am
[1:35:14] not going to keep this a secret from
[1:35:16] you.
[1:35:17] I'm going to visit you according to the
[1:35:20] time of life."
[1:35:23] Hallelujah.
[1:35:24] Time of love. Time of life.
[1:35:30] Hallelujah. That is that is for the
[1:35:33] married couple. Amen. Yes, sir. Amen.
[1:35:38] Amen. He said he couldn't keep that
[1:35:40] secret from Abraham.
[1:35:43] Amen. Amen. Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:35:48] Hallelujah.
[1:35:50] Now, now before we go, we can go to
[1:35:53] Romans uh chapter 8 verse 6 and 7.
[1:35:57] Amen.
[1:35:59] Hallelujah.
[1:36:02] Now, there's there's one interesting
[1:36:04] thing about knowledge. Amen. Yes, sir.
[1:36:07] knowledge can can get you to a point
[1:36:11] where you can fear depending on the
[1:36:13] amount of knowledge that you have
[1:36:16] or you can be completely in assurance.
[1:36:21] Amen. So let's say I'm just looking at
[1:36:24] it in in this way. Let's say you've been
[1:36:26] asked to go somewhere we have no idea
[1:36:29] about.
[1:36:31] Sometimes you do hear stories that
[1:36:34] people have said. Right? So they said
[1:36:36] okay when you go to this city you're
[1:36:38] going to meet this you're going to have
[1:36:40] this this is going to happen to you and
[1:36:42] that and that is going to happen to you
[1:36:44] because you have partial knowledge about
[1:36:47] it. You get into the state of fear
[1:36:51] anxiety because they said a lot of
[1:36:53] things but then when you go and
[1:36:55] experience it yourself. Amen. The next
[1:36:59] time you're going, you have a knowledge
[1:37:02] of how to overcome any situation that
[1:37:04] comes your way. That is why it is
[1:37:07] important for knowledge to be complete.
[1:37:11] Amen. Those who cause a lot of trouble
[1:37:15] are those who just have an idea about a
[1:37:17] concept.
[1:37:20] Because when the truth is coming to
[1:37:22] them, they'll tell you, I know about
[1:37:24] this.
[1:37:25] But then they didn't have the full
[1:37:27] picture. of the whole thing. They are
[1:37:31] mostly the trouble causes.

[1:37:44] little bit or a part of the knowledge.
[1:37:46] Amen. He causes a lot of trouble. Amen.
[1:37:50] But then the bride is stabilized. Amen.
[1:37:53] Because the bride knows what is going to
[1:37:55] happen. We are not moved. Amen. People
[1:37:58] who have no idea or or or have some idea
[1:38:02] about the coming of the Lord are in
[1:38:04] constant fear
[1:38:06] because what they know is that when the
[1:38:09] coming of when the time of the coming of
[1:38:11] the Lord comes, you're going to u see
[1:38:14] cars knocking each other. You're see um
[1:38:17] earthquakes and all those things
[1:38:18] happening. And so people are so scared
[1:38:21] about that. But the bride has a complete
[1:38:25] picture of the coming of the Lord to we
[1:38:28] are so stabilized and now we have gotten
[1:38:31] to the point where we are like Lord come
[1:38:34] quickly. I want to see you. I want to
[1:38:37] see how you look like. I' I I've been
[1:38:40] talking about you. You've been
[1:38:42] manifesting in healing. You've been
[1:38:44] manifesting in the sermons. You've been
[1:38:47] manif you manifested when my wife was
[1:38:49] sick. Amen. and and and and and you came
[1:38:52] and said, "I am the Lord your healer.
[1:38:54] I'm Jehovah Rafa." You manifested when
[1:38:58] when when I didn't have money. Amen. And
[1:39:01] he said, "I am the Lord your provider."
[1:39:04] Amen. Amen. So, Amen. So, the bride is
[1:39:08] waiting to see him because the bride has
[1:39:12] full knowledge. Amen. Of who he is. That
[1:39:16] is why it is important
[1:39:18] to get knowledge.
[1:39:22] That is why it is important to have
[1:39:24] knowledge.
[1:39:26] Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:39:29] Romans chapter 8 verse 6 and 7.
[1:39:33] Lord help me.
[1:39:41] Oh Lord Jesus. Romans 8.
[1:39:48] Romans 8. Yes, sir. Romans chapter 8
[1:39:50] verse 6 and 7.
[1:39:56] It said, "For to be carnally
[1:39:59] minded is death,
[1:40:02] but to be spiritually minded is life and
[1:40:07] peace."
[1:40:09] Amen.
[1:40:10] life and peace.
[1:40:14] So when you have that spiritual mind,
[1:40:18] when the Lord brings that stability in
[1:40:21] your life, it is speaks to you because
[1:40:25] you understand what is happening. Amen.
[1:40:28] When when a child is growing up, Amen.
[1:40:31] and and is going through certain
[1:40:33] trouble. Amen. The parents are looking
[1:40:35] at the child and like okay we have been

[1:40:40] getting to. They are not moved but the
[1:40:42] child can can can be moved. The child
[1:40:45] will be like what is happening to me?
[1:40:46] Especially maybe if it's a girl child
[1:40:48] and get to that teenage years. Amen.
[1:40:51] It's like but what's happening to me?
[1:40:53] I'm having headache. I'm having this
[1:40:55] that and and and all those things
[1:40:58] and amen. And then and then mama will be
[1:41:01] looking at you and like okay my child is
[1:41:04] growing. Welcome to the club. Amen. Mama
[1:41:07] is not moved. Amen. Because mama has a
[1:41:10] complete knowledge of what is going on.
[1:41:13] But you the child maybe you might have
[1:41:16] heard something from your friends. Amen.
[1:41:18] It begins to destabilize your mind.
[1:41:20] Amen. That is why it is important to get
[1:41:23] the full picture of Christ. Amen. People
[1:41:27] don't understand Christ enough. So when
[1:41:30] challenges are happening in their life,
[1:41:32] it disturbs them a lot. It disturbs
[1:41:35] their mind. Amen. When you ask God for
[1:41:37] something and he says no. If you don't
[1:41:40] get the complete picture, it's going to
[1:41:42] disturb your mind. You'll be like,
[1:41:44] "Lord, are you not going to give this to
[1:41:47] me?" Amen. But hallelujah.
[1:41:51] When he's 4 days late,

[1:42:18] has so many things in store. Amen.
[1:42:21] Hallelujah. You might be looking for a
[1:42:23] child. Amen. Hallelujah. But the Lord
[1:42:26] has something in store. It's not just
[1:42:29] one event. Amen. But multiple events.
[1:42:32] And God specializes in this. Amen. He
[1:42:35] can just take one stone. Amen. Not kill
[1:42:39] two beds, but kill multiple beds.
[1:42:45] Hallelujah.
[1:42:48] Yes, sir.
[1:42:50] Hallelujah. He can just throw that
[1:42:52] stone. It knock this and this goes to
[1:42:55] knock that knock this knock this knock
[1:42:56] and knocks everything out. Hallelujah.
[1:43:00] That is the God that we serve.
[1:43:03] Yes, sir. Oh, Lord Jesus. I'm still
[1:43:07] watching my time. Oh my. Yes, sir.
[1:43:12] Amen.
[1:43:13] He said because the carnal mind is
[1:43:16] enmity against God for it is not subject
[1:43:20] to the law of God neither indeed can be.
[1:43:25] Amen. So carnality has to do with the
[1:43:28] way we are thinking. A it aality in in
[1:43:33] its u definition has to do with the
[1:43:36] flesh. Right. But then it's talking
[1:43:40] about the fleshly thinking. Right. Amen.
[1:43:44] But then God also uses the carnal mind
[1:43:48] spiritually. That's exactly right. So
[1:43:51] when we are talking about the body,
[1:43:54] Amen. We have the functions that God has
[1:43:58] made the body for. Amen. Each body part
[1:44:02] has a function. And all these things
[1:44:06] fall in line with the program of God.
[1:44:09] So when God comes, he's bringing your
[1:44:11] mind to how these things work. That is
[1:44:13] why he's talking about the ear. He's
[1:44:15] talking about the eye. He said this can
[1:44:17] function without this one. Amen. The
[1:44:20] ones that we think that they they are
[1:44:22] not uh uh what's the word? Amen. They
[1:44:27] are not important. Amen. Amen. Those
[1:44:30] ones, Amen. that we think are not
[1:44:33] important. Amen. Amen. They do certain
[1:44:37] things that connect the important ones.
[1:44:43] Amen. That connect the important ones.
[1:44:46] Amen. Amen. That is why when your toe
[1:44:48] hurts. Amen.
[1:44:50] You can be home for a whole week.
[1:44:54] But you might think that it is your hand
[1:44:55] that you are using to work. Amen. But
[1:44:58] just that little nail on that toe, Amen.
[1:45:03] is is going to knock you down for days.
[1:45:06] Amen. Yes, sir.
[1:45:10] When somebody pokes your eye. Amen. You
[1:45:14] know how precious it is. Amen.
[1:45:16] Hallelujah. Yes, sir. So, to be carnally
[1:45:20] minded has to do with the way our
[1:45:23] intellect is programmed connected to um
[1:45:27] the the nature of how we were born.
[1:45:29] Amen. Amen. That's what Bible is talking
[1:45:32] about. So having that carnal mindset,
[1:45:36] Amen. is an opposition, That's right. to
[1:45:40] the program of God. That's right. Cuz
[1:45:42] any program of God is spiritual. That's
[1:45:45] right. So we say the Bible is spiritual
[1:45:48] because it is the program of God. How
[1:45:51] God has laid the foundations, how he
[1:45:53] wants them to go, how events are
[1:45:56] supposed to take place. That is why
[1:45:58] anything that is contrary to how God has
[1:46:02] programmed everything we say it is
[1:46:05] intellectual.
[1:46:08] It's carnal. Amen. Amen. So verse eight,
[1:46:13] he said, "So then they that so then they
[1:46:17] that are in the flesh cannot please
[1:46:20] God." That's right.
[1:46:22] Amen. Those that are in the flesh cannot
[1:46:26] please God. has to do with our carnal
[1:46:28] thinking.
[1:46:32] I want to try and hurry up. Amen.
[1:46:35] This is this is um from the message a
[1:46:37] deceived church by the world. Uhhuh.
[1:46:40] Paragraph 16. He said, "And there's no
[1:46:43] need for any man to try to make his
[1:46:46] worldly knowledge and ever please God
[1:46:48] with it." He said, "It's an abomination
[1:46:52] in the sight of God. You will never
[1:46:54] please God with the worldly ambitions
[1:46:57] and knowledge because it's en enmity to
[1:47:01] God says the scripture. He cannot do it.
[1:47:05] That's right. Amen. And each one tries
[1:47:08] to have all the knowledge. They know
[1:47:11] just what to do and the words to say and
[1:47:14] it becomes just a political speech in
[1:47:17] thestead of a powerly demonstrated Holy
[1:47:21] Spirit message that sinks to the heart
[1:47:25] of man and discovers his saints.
[1:47:29] Amen.
[1:47:31] So intellectually we all we all know
[1:47:33] politicians. Amen.
[1:47:36] Yeah. As long as they want their party
[1:47:39] to come into power. Amen. They're going
[1:47:42] to say all sort of things. Amen. Amen.
[1:47:45] And then when they get into power,
[1:47:47] sometimes we get disappointed. Amen.
[1:47:49] Amen. Cuz they have to talk in such a
[1:47:52] way to sway your mind. Amen. To kind of
[1:47:56] fall for them. Amen. Political speech.
[1:47:59] Amen. That is conality. Amen. We are
[1:48:02] talking about the spirit of God. And he
[1:48:04] said spiritually the Holy Ghost comes to
[1:48:08] demonstrate what he's talking about. So
[1:48:11] when the Holy Spirit says something, it
[1:48:13] is not just to persuade you with with
[1:48:17] enticing words of men. Amen. But it's
[1:48:19] coming to demonstrate what he's talking
[1:48:21] about. So the only way for us to
[1:48:24] understand what the spirit of God is
[1:48:26] saying is by seeing it happen.
[1:48:32] Amen. Amen. That is why the Lord always
[1:48:35] watches over his word. He will never
[1:48:38] miss the mark. That is why every promise
[1:48:42] of the Lord is an assurance to his
[1:48:44] bride.
[1:48:47] Amen. Amen. He said, "But all these men
[1:48:51] go off to seminaries and they learn
[1:48:53] great educations. how they must stand
[1:48:56] before the people, how they must present
[1:49:00] themselves, how they must dress, and how
[1:49:03] they must act. They should never use the
[1:49:06] wrong grammar.
[1:49:08] So you see,
[1:49:12] carnality, amen, teaches you these
[1:49:15] things. Amen. But God also teaches you
[1:49:19] how to dress.
[1:49:22] And how to talk. Amen.
[1:49:25] Amen. And how to act. Amen. Amen. That
[1:49:29] is why he puts order in the church.
[1:49:32] Amen. So when we are coming the way we
[1:49:35] have to act. Amen. Not just in the
[1:49:37] church when we are outside the way we
[1:49:39] act. Not to play hypocrisy when we are
[1:49:42] in church. Amen. So God gives us the
[1:49:45] directions on how we should act. Not
[1:49:49] man's knowledge. Because men go to put
[1:49:53] things together to entice other men to
[1:49:56] convince other men.
[1:49:59] Amen. But that is not the way of God.
[1:50:01] Amen. So Paul said the gospel that I
[1:50:04] preached didn't come like but it come
[1:50:07] through the renewing of the Holy Ghost
[1:50:11] and the power of demonstrations
[1:50:14] doesn't come by a right formed speech
[1:50:18] that your wisdom would be or your trust
[1:50:20] will be in the wisdom of men but it come
[1:50:23] through the demonstrations of the power
[1:50:26] of the risen Christ that's the gospel to
[1:50:29] know him in the power of his
[1:50:32] resurrection
[1:50:35] to know him in the power of his
[1:50:38] resurrection.
[1:50:40] That is why when he portrays or he
[1:50:44] manifest that he is the resurrection.
[1:50:48] That was the gospel that was preached to
[1:50:50] the Jews. Amen. And he began to pull
[1:50:54] people. He began to pull the Jews in the
[1:50:57] power of his resurrection. Amen. And we
[1:51:00] know him in the power of his
[1:51:02] resurrection in this last age. Amen.
[1:51:05] That he comes, he shows us the cloud.
[1:51:08] Amen. In the power of his resurrection.
[1:51:11] And he said, "I am the risen Christ.
[1:51:14] Coming to the bride, the capstone
[1:51:17] ministry. It is time for us to meet him
[1:51:21] in the air." Glory to God. We invite
[1:51:23] Brother Steven. Amen.
[1:51:30] Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:51:33] Amen. I couldn't finish my sermon
[1:51:35] tonight, but I'll just end it here.
[1:51:37] Amen. Invite Brother Steven. Amen.
[1:51:42] Praise God. Oh, praise God. Praise God.
[1:51:45] Wonderful. Wonderful. Wonderful. Oh,
[1:51:49] hallelujah. Amen. What a landing.
[1:51:53] I was sitting right there still waiting
[1:51:55] for him to continue.
[1:51:59] Oh, praise God. Let's give the Lord a
[1:52:01] big
[1:52:08] clap. Praise God. Praise God. Praise
[1:52:11] God. Praise God. Praise God. My people
[1:52:14] suffer for lack of knowledge. And this
[1:52:17] knowledge that he's preaching about is
[1:52:19] godly knowledge. Amen. If you go to the
[1:52:23] stature of a perfect man, you read it.
[1:52:25] Brother Brandham say this is a godly
[1:52:27] knowledge. It's a knowledge of God. It's
[1:52:29] come by revelation of the word of God.
[1:52:32] Amen. Amen. We are so privileged. God
[1:52:35] gave the promise and when God the pro
[1:52:37] when God gave the promise, God will
[1:52:40] watch over that promise to fulfill it.
[1:52:43] Amen. Amen. God doesn't send his word
[1:52:48] for vain. No sir, never it will never
[1:52:51] return to him void. It will accomplish
[1:52:54] that which God is sending it. Amen.
[1:52:58] Don't look at this world to trust or to
[1:53:01] cling in anything. That's right. Amen.
[1:53:04] Everything is shaking. They don't even
[1:53:06] know what they doing themselves. Amen.
[1:53:09] Everybody's acting like crazy. War here,
[1:53:13] war there, war there, war there.
[1:53:15] Pakistan, India and this one. All over
[1:53:17] the world, it's a mess. What started in
[1:53:20] Israel is still continue. Amen. Is one
[1:53:23] thing, one thing, it's only the word of
[1:53:27] God. Amen. If you put your hope into
[1:53:30] this world, you'll be completely
[1:53:32] disappointed. But the word of God will
[1:53:35] change you completely and give you hope
[1:53:37] that will renew you every day knowing
[1:53:40] that God is in control of your life and
[1:53:42] God is making everything work together
[1:53:46] for good. Amen. No matter how hard it
[1:53:49] is, God is doing everything and we have
[1:53:53] an expected end. Amen. Trust in the
[1:53:56] Lord. You will never be disappointed.
[1:54:00] Glory to God. Wonderful message, brother
[1:54:02] set. I'm
[1:54:09] happy. It make you feel so good when you
[1:54:12] see them picking up like this and keep
[1:54:14] moving and keep moving and keep moving.
[1:54:16] So I can sit down and just watch them
[1:54:18] being preaching weeks after week. Huh?
[1:54:21] Right. Oh my
[1:54:24] god. Somebody say yes. Somebody say no.
[1:54:27] Okay. We get a mixed blend together.
[1:54:29] Amen. Amen.
[1:54:33] Brother Brandham said the pastor is
[1:54:34] elected until until and brother Steven
[1:54:38] won't die. I'm going to the rapture.
[1:54:44] Are we together? Are we together? So I'm
[1:54:47] not going to be here preaching
[1:54:48] Wednesday, Sunday, Wednesday, Sunday.
[1:54:51] Hey, slow down. Use some wisdom. God put
[1:54:56] people there. God put brothers from
[1:54:58] other churches. Let the brother preach.
[1:55:01] Let the five four ministry do their job.
[1:55:04] And he blessed the
[1:55:07] bride. It is not one man show. You need
[1:55:09] to learn how to pass the ball and let
[1:55:12] the other person go and score. Amen. And
[1:55:15] we learning from one another. You sit
[1:55:17] down and you learn things every single
[1:55:20] day and we thank God for it. Let's stand
[1:55:22] my friend.
