no no if you're going to be here on time we'll move aside and i was like all right i was like we're barely going to be here on time but we'll make it and we we did and by god's grace even a wrong turn

me how great is our god and all we'll see how great how great is our god amen amen he is great and greatly to be praised there is no god like him [Applause] i used to wonder what that saying meant when i was a kid there's no god like him because i'm like he's the only god there obviously there's no god like him there's only one god and it was until i got older that i realized that god is an object of worship and though the world worships other things this group of people only worships one thing and that's the one true god so even people can make brother branham a god and we've been accused of that here but we don't do that we know that it was one the same i got to be careful i don't want to confuse anybody we know is one and the same but we know is god working through the man not the man himself but we believe there's only one true god one true god and that's the lord jesus christ and i'm grateful that he died on the cross for me and he saved me and then he sent me his prophet to teach me his word and to help me grow he gave us the pastor to our age as we're as we're learning and i'm so grateful for just his his plan the way he put things together it's just such a blessing the way he did it i'm so grateful for it does anybody have a testimony the same thing on their heart that they'd like to give kelly amen thank you praise the lord thanks i tell you it's like fire shut up in my bones i had to tell this testimony we went out sunday when we stopped by the restaurant to get our supper and uh we saw brother john and them there and we went in and went up the order of food and uh i stand there a gentleman came in and i spoke to him i said how you doing he said fine he walked and he looked and he looked at me again he said i got a question for you he said you used to go down to the jail and have bible study i said yes sir he said i thought that was you he said i want to let you know at the time i was struggling drinking drugging said two years he said i've been clean for two years he said i just want to tell you this what you doing works keep doing what you're doing god bless you amen praise the lord does anybody else have a testimony this evening [Applause] we know that prayer works just keep on praying pray for whatever you have need of because god answers prayer sometimes it's not always the answer we want but god answers prayer he's never failed me that's for sure but we have a prayer request this evening and i don't have a name on it so i'm not sure who handed it in but it says childhood friend was badly in a bad accident and they are

you all in the name of the lord jesus christ how many are happy tonight hallelujah brother david gave me more in this it looks like this church loved the bazooka be all the music amen you very much amen everybody can hear me pretty good that's it we have a plan b whatever i praise the lord for you to be here tonight he sent a message he was not going to be here tonight because he had to travel so i sat down and i thought about it i just say a prayer i say lord may you send him to church tonight and when i came in here he's the one singing i'd say but robert is this it okay praise the lord amen so god hear those prayers that you think that the student small one sometimes we think we have to go like jesus jesus lord turn the council of fajita fell into foolishness that's it that's what david said and that was it and the men got in trouble amen so the lord is working blessed be the name of the lord you keep sister cheryl the hamilton in prayer she's going to a little situation she is fun it's just a family situation with her family so just keep her in prayer so that the lord will intervene and show his mighty hand amen blessed be the name of the lord but robert if i remember well the trust in this coming sunday is the building fund yes so just remember the building fun this coming sunday lord's willing so we can continue and finish what we got to do on our agenda amen the lord is working bodily and in a powerful way somebody who's not a member of this church gave a building fund offering you want me to tell you the amount again [Laughter] he gave five hundred dollars see [Applause] amen so god has been working left and right in a miraculous way amen how many enjoy the service on sunday have you pointed to him you are malachite the one who was troubling you troubling your children troubling your wife troubling your husband troubling your uncle your nephew amen just show to him say this is the malacca david will slow him amen he already did it at the cross he will slay him he already did it at the cross amen it's just up to you to say this is it go ahead and slay him amen blessed be the name of the lord let's go to our scripture tonight roman chapter 12. for the one who put the title on youtube it's origin chapter 3 origin 3. so if you can correct that origin 2 was on sunday so we we're going origin 1 origin 2 origin 3. i thought i'm going to preach it one time and move on and as soon as i touch it everything open up amen do you remember me telling you that i will preach on predestination have you caught it already that we're going through predestination have you caught it all you want in a title that's a predestination amen the way we go we navigate into a story in the bible and then through that story you'll begin to see things in the bible branching out all of this the first death the second death all of these are locked in the book of esther if i show you i say this is the first death you can say amen but you don't understand that's why we need to open the mystery of the first death open the second death open everything so when you go back to the book of esther you look you say i see why it's the first thing i see right here i see it right so the message gives you tools to unlock the scripture that's why paul said we preach christ according to the revelation of the mystery in other words you preach christ according to the message of the hour amen if not you're going to preach another christ yet you're saying christ but it's not christ [Laughter] hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord brother branham was preparing to preach the trumpet he even went and searched for a room until the lord told him he said you don't have to go dara you already preached the trumpet when you were preaching the sixth hill amen so as i was going i said my god this is just pulling me to predestination predestination i say okay somebody will catch it that will preaching predestination to understand the second death you need to understand predestination or origin so it's origin one origin 2 tonight is origin 3. everybody clear yeah we saw the white throne judgment on sunday you saw those that are as the lamb and the other one as the goat amen and the mercy that you can give it to them so we continue there is a different area and if you get this correctly you will put it together in the book of life because remember in the white throne judgment the book of life is open why is he open because they are named that are going to be there but they are not part of the bride amen the bread is in the lamb's book of life which is a section inside the book of life oh my god romans chapter 12 verse one i already felt the anointing here with the music so it's going to be your problem who whoever is pulling romans chapter 12 verse 1 if you dare you can say amen i beseech you therefore who you might be seated is paul talking to the unbelievers he's talking to her if you miss this you're not going to understand the scripture this is why people has been preaching the gospel a different way amen i beseech you who so paul is talking to who [Music] paul is talking to believers the devil you're just wasting your time the breathing all believers everybody clear so when you keep this in mind then you will understand what is coming down if you miss this you miss everything amen i beseech you therefore brethren by the mercies of god we know who he who is the vessels of mercy amen that you present your bodies i living sacrifice that's why we don't put high heels we don't put makeup we don't put all this kind of stuff because our body are reflecting the gospel amen watch it now a living sacrifice holy acceptable to god which is your reasonable service we already explained to you this many times now jump to verse three remember in verse one it's brethren verse 3 for i say through the grace given to me to every man that is among who who are they you the believer so he's talking about the believer keep that in mind amen not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think but to think soberly according as god has dealt to every man the measure of water god didn't give everybody the measure of faith amen it is to the brethren to the believers do you see how we preach the gospel down there oh god gave everybody the measure of faith no everybody doesn't have the measure of faith if they have the measure of faith they're going to be saved but not everybody is going to be saved make sense now so to these brethren these believers their god gave them a measure of faith that's what makes them believers [Music] amen god because usually what we say we say god has dealt to every man the measure of faith so we have a tendency to think like everybody in this world has been given a measure of faith that's not the case it is only to them by the believer according to your origin make sense in non-seed there is nothing to how are you going to have faith there are certain people that are non-seed you see now amen so i said through the grace given to me to every man that is among you among the believers i'm talking to the believer not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think but to think soberly according as god has dealt to every man those believers the measure of faith for us we have many members in how many body so we who is he talking to the believer of the body of who makes sense now everybody that entered there entered by birth by one spirit we are born into the body if you burn into the body god gave you a measure of what if not you are outside so as we have many members in one body and all members have not the same office everybody clear so we being many are one body in christ you see that and everyone remember one of another having then gift that fairing according to the grace that is given to us where the prophecy let us prophesy according to the water proportion of water you see that a measure of faith everybody clear so what i want you to keep here to every believer not everybody i know it's going to be a different avenue but you're going to get it down the road i have scripture and we're going to back it up amen if we get on sunday then you'll see more things unfolding so to every believer god give a measure of faith everybody clear when boaz was redeeming naomi was boaz going to get married to naomi everybody here if you look at the work he's working for naomi but in his backyard mind he's going to get married to ruth amen let's go to titus chapter 2. usually i keep them in order but if i do it today you're not going to get it so we need to go back and forth usually i want you to go one two three today you're going one three and two amen tattoos too if you dare you can say amen all right verse 11 for the grace of god that brings salvation has appeared to who so all men can be saved let's see the grace of god appeared to who did they say whether they believe it or not the grace of god that brings salvation has appeared to all men the rich young ruler met salvation the rich young ruler met the grace that was bringing salvation but even though he came in contact with the grace that brings salvation he ended up in hell even though salvation appeared to all men not all men will be saved make sense now amen teaching us that denying ungodliness and worldly lust we should live soberly righteously and godly in this present world looking for that blessed hope and the glorious appearing of the great god and our savior the great god deity ready jesus is god the great god me and my father we are what i want you to keep is the grace that brings salvation appeal to all men but not really all men let's go to second thessalonians now you need to go back amen we read this before so you should be familiar hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord 2nd thessalonians 2 verse 9 even him the antichrist whose coming is after the working of satan with all power and son and lying wonders amen is working by the power of satan amen and with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that do water so certain people will perish there is something in certain people that will make them believe the antichrist [Music] this is hard food because they receive not the love of the water that there might be water or how can salvation appear to everybody but some people did not receive the love of the truth you should be really thankful if you were a christian amen god could have chose you to be somebody else amen but he could not he didn't have no choice no option to choose you because you were in it the real you not the one i'm looking at right now but the real you never had the beginning [Music] don't worry church we're going to preach you into this going to repeat it repeat it until you get it and for this cause god sent them strong delusion that they should believe the water you can talk to them bring scripture bring code brings pictures they don't see it yet the grace of god that brings salvation appear too you see now let's see that they all might be damned condemned who believe not the truth but had pleasure in water how do you condemn them because there is nothing that was put there to receive the truth that's why paul said who are you to question god he's the powder he can bring the vessel off and reversal of what it's the sovereignty of god amen but we are bound to give thank our words to god for you always for you why brethren beloved of the lord because god has from the beginning chosen you to what you didn't put yourself there you were programmed to be saved amen through sanctification of the spirit and belief of the water that sanctification is of the spirit it's the holy spirit doing that amen not you and belief of the water it is god believing god you are just a carrier of god hallelujah hallelujah when mary carried the seed of jesus christ amen when she spoke the name of jesus christ john the baptist over there in the belly from the belly to the belly they were communicating amen where do he call you by our gospel to the obtaining of the glory of the lord jesus christ brethren therefore brethren stand fast and hold the tradition which you have been taught whether by word the voice you remember tapes or episode which is the books in the time of paul it was word and epistle in our time we get 10th recorder they recorded it we have word and we have books i preach like paul do you see i preach like paul if he preached like paul what do you expect amen now job to chapter 3. finally brethren pray for us that the word of the lord may have free course and be glorified even as it is with you so with this believer the word of god has a highway free course when you preach destination amen and it's been glorified amen watch verse two and that we may be delivered from our unreasonable and wicked water the grace of man of god that saved all man that's that brings salvation appeal to how many men oh man jesus love everybody amen delivered from unreasonable and wicked man you there for all men right here the grace that appeared to all men all men same word for all men have not water so there are certain people that do have faith because they were predestinated to be saved and other do not have faith how do you expect them together amen the origin will determine if you can you are subject to the second death or not everybody clear so we started he was talking to the brethren to the believer god gave them a measure of faith predestinated from before the foundation of the word for you to be saved the grace of god appeared to all men but paul continued he says that all men do not have faith so you're going to have a mixed malted pray heavenly father lord we thank you again for your grace your love your mercy and for everything you have been doing in the midst of your children father thank you for giving us another opportunity tonight to gather together around the revealed world of the hour father i have done what every man that you given an ability to can do lord this is as far as i can go but now father we are looking unto thee the holy spirit to come down and to minister to us lord father remember again lord father sister sherrod you know exactly what to do in every circumstances because there is nothing that takes you lord by by uh by chance you already know everything prior the foundation of the world because you're a god that is infinite the god that knows everything lord father what we're asking is for your grace lord father to overcome every situation and bring lord father solution where it's needed lord father may the devil and his army be completely sealed out of this place and this property father may nothing but the holy spirit lord and the angel of the living god not the devil but the angel of the living god the elect angel father be here ministering to your children lord we commit everything unto the hand in jesus precious name amen god richly bless you you've already been seated like i stated we are in the second banquet of esther part five we're dealing with the second death but origin part three everybody clear on sunday we already seen about the white throne judgment when we spoke about men we know that men have three parts the soul the spirit and the body everybody clears so far then the soul and the spirit make the spiritual man or the living part of a man and the body make the natural man or the non-living part of the man because james said that the body without the spirit is dead in other words if you take the spirit out completely the body cannot move it's the spirit that makes the body operate amen now since we're dealing with the spiritual death about the body i wanted to go back here and drop again slowly in luke chapter 12 the bible says that and i say unto you my friend be not afraid of them that can kill the body and after that have no more that they can do so we can see right here that i even though the killing of the body is not the end amen the killing of the body is the end to satan and to the people of the world but there is something that you can do beyond the killing of the body amen what can you do but i will forewarn you whom you shall fear i'm gonna show you who you should respect feel him which after he had killed he can kill just like satan he can kill just like anybody can shoot you amen he can kill like a car accident or something after he had killed has power to cast into hell so the first thing that we see from god here god can open the door for death to strike you amen but depending on your origin if your origin was not from the mind of god god will cast you into hell anybody clear this hell here have a meaning it means prison amen because you need to be judged before they execute you anybody clear i'm going to get down the road into the prison how was that prison open because hell was created amen hell did not exist before hair was created because the devil rebel so they got to be a prison to put him amen hallelujah matthew 28 10 28 and fear not them which killed the body they can do it satan can do it and the people can do it but are not able to kill the soul that's a second part amen but rather in in luke chapter 12 you can get killed and they put you in here but you are still alive you are alive in hell in your soul which is living in a theophany amen everybody clear that's why the rich young ruler was in soul talking to father abraham everybody ever here if you remember the souls under the altar were crying out they were crying out for vengeance so when you die here you are now really dead you are still alive because paul said if this tabernacle dissolved we enter into another tabernacle amen so god first have the power to open death the first death to hit your body then you can put you in soul as in prison but in soul in hell you can still be living like the rich young ruler he was talking to abraham and he recognized uh uh lazarus ever clear but in matthew 10 verse 28 the bible says here that it is who who can kill the body but are not able to kill the soul now it's not talking about the killing of the body only and going to hell but it's talking about the killing of the body about here and then this is followed by the killing of the soul and back here in this place you are no longer in existence anybody here on the first scenario you are killed you put in here you still alive but you alive and atonement because you're in prison under the flame look anybody here the book of luke but in here when they kill you amen they kill again your soul you disappear completely you are no longer in existence what are you trying to say but rather feel him which is able to destroy buff water and body where the hell is not this hell this hair is a hell that destroyed the body and destroy what this one is just a prison that they put you in waiting for your court trial anybody clear but being in prison you are not comfortable you are tormented ever clear but this hell here is a different hair it's a hell that when they put you there he also killed the body but the body was already killed here why does this hair have to kill the body again makes sense now in here they kill your body and then you stay alive in here they killed the body and the soul so to kill this body the body must be alive again anybody here there is a resurrection that happened to this body ever here and then this body and the soul that entering must be destroyed i'm going slowly [Laughter] blessed be the name of the lord hallelujah that's why when you look in a different translation you will see they change that word hell into gehenna make sense now okay in revelation chapter 20 verse 11 and i saw a great white throne and him that sat on it from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away that's a judge and there was no no there was fun no place for them and i saw the dead small and great you remember this not the same age small and great stand before god they were dead remember by now they are standing before god so a resurrection happened but the resurrect the way they went into the grave if they die as a teenager they woke up teenager if they die 40 years old they woke up 40 years old but when they wake up they are waking up before the judgment amen that's why brother branham said resurrection is not replacement resurrection is what went down there coming back up again and when they back up again in the same body if they were thinking about going to the nightclub and they got involved in the car wreck when they woke up they woke up with the same desire did you follow me you remember i showed you that in the book of ezekiel the bible says when a sinner died his sin lays on his one bones you remember they go with their sin in their body so when they are resurrected back for judgment they are resurrected with their sin now god need to destroy both their body and do you love the bible is it clear now so this distraction this hair is something else at the opening of the seventh hill the bible became anew what is the name of this hell amen and books were open and another book was open so there are many books oh god give me time which is the book of life so here there are books plural and there is another book which is the book of life so in the judgment there are many books and they are the book of life amen here they're going to read a lot of stuff in your life but the final determination where you going will be the book of life the book of life is the supreme judge it's the book of origin amen and another book was open which is the book of life and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the what not the book of life so when you do bad things somebody is recording anybody everybody when you're drinking when you're smoking when you're committing fornication and everything somebody's recording in heaven and not only recording us writing but they are also recording you with a camera hallelujah according to the water work so this book here these books are books that record your works is the bread here so what happened to your works and the sea gave up the dead which were in it and death and hell deliver up the dead there is a resurrection which were in them and they were judged every man according to the water they are still using the books he did this he stole he did this he went drinking he didn't listen to his father all of that written you wanted that record cleared there is a way to clear it amen and death and hell were cast in the lake of what this is the second and whosoever was not found written in the book of life eberle was cast into the lake of water so the place where the body and the soul are destroyed is the lake of water so this hell here is the lake of fire everybody here the first hell is a prison they put you to be judged amen your soul is put in torment until the appropriate time which is the judgment of the white throne but in this judgment of the white throne you're going to be resurrected back again if you didn't go by the atonement ever here and when you are resurrected with the same sin and the same desire that you have ever here if you die with a tattoo you are waking up with a tattoo hallelujah there is only one way to remove your title if you can't see a surgeon it's to have a glorified body ever cleared so far so we see that here we can destroy both the soul in hell both the soul and the body in hell who's doing that it's the judge who's the judge it's the lord he's our lawgiver he's our king he will do what save us in james chapter 4 verse 12 the bible says there is one lawgiver which is god who is able to save and to destroy remember one he's saving about here the other one he's destroying when he's saving his lamb when he's destroying his leo the lion anybody clear but we who accepted the atonement amen for john there is no leo the lion leo the lion for john is a blessing ever here for the bread of jesus christ the coming of the lord is not something they feel it's something they're actually waiting expecting and longing for because when the judge come not only is he coming to get us but he is coming with a different revelation of justification hallelujah the bible says that he that comes to me is i will in no ways cast out is that right and listen here is the man's word about it jesus christ saint john 5 24 he whosoever he that heareth my words and believeth on him that sent me has present tense has now presented everlasting water that is not just from one meeting to another that is a temporary but this one is eternal everlasting that is not just for one meaning to another everlasting life and shall not come into work so there is no way you can stand to be judged that's why the scriptures say blessed is who who's gonna be part in the first resurrection the second death has nothing to do with you because your judgment is already when you're alive hallelujah you shall not come into judgment or condemnation never be cast away you can never go to the lake of fire because you cannot kill god [Music] how do you kill him again amen saint john 5 24 jesus said so i am the bread of life that come from heaven out of heaven for your father's eighth man are in the wilderness and are dead we're going to get into this but he that eats my flesh and drink my blood have everlasting life and i shall raise him up at the last day in other words he's not gonna face the second death which is the lake of fire to destroy your body and to destroy your soul in other words to wipe you out of existence if they wipe you out of existence it means you never existed before everybody here those that received the second death had a beginning everybody here oh my that makes you forget the hot weather notice and while you are in that body you are just as free from condemnation as he is you shall never have to stand any judgment god cause judgment to be struck upon his body and if you are in him god cannot judge you he is already judged you when he judge christ that's why you don't go to the tribulation period the sixth year he crashed in in the uh uh uh at calvary in the cross so when christ was dying you were judged there you were sinner by representation and you are also judged by representation and justified by representation and rose again by representation hallelujah if what has first adam did affected us what the second adam have done also must be affecting our life [Music] [Applause] why do you accept the first adam and you don't accept the second adam because the first already because the the second existed before the man from heaven amen you want to condemn me for adam fine don't stop there put a camera you must finish your story you must bring the second adam and in the second adam i was also represented there in the first adam i was represented identified by death by the second adam i'm identified by life that i always existed and i will never be destroyed and i'm going back to my father amen death is nothing nothing to the believer amen he's already judged you when he judged christ amen the ordinance that was against you was nailed at the cross amen and you can't be under judgment no more christ took your judgment and when you are baptized into that body of christ you are free from god's judgment the wrath of god will pass over you that is why he said when i see the blood i shall pass over you so the one way to avoid judgment is to accept jesus christ and to be born again and him that receive the son have passed from death and to life never to come to judgment or condemnation again amen blessed be the name of the lord that's why the judge came with a white wig amen and when we came what did he say well if you turn the picture that decent look we know to the right right right you can probably see it from the audience it is crust see his eyes looking here just as perfect as it could be wearing the white wig of water supreme deity and water but it's not bringing us fear amen when esther sees the king she is not afraid she is married to the king she long to see her husband she long to see the one that she loves when the king comes she's happy she's not trembling amen because that supreme deity is the judge but when he sees us the queen minister what do you want amen the lord said do not enter into the king in a cult if you are not called esther enter there amen by law as they was condemned by the supreme church the king stretch the scepter and say i am the one who decide you're not gonna die you shall leave [Music] he can bypass that law hallelujah the supreme judge of all heaven and earth can you see his eyes nose his mouth just turned the picture from this the way the head this way and the way it's supposed to be he's supreme judge why is the supreme judge coming there is none other but him and that is a perfect identification again a vindication that this message is what come on this is the truth it is true amen that's why people attack the cloud because if they discredit the cloud they are discrediting the vindication of the message and making him not a third person but the only person with the white see you see the dark his face his beard and his eyes and notice he's looking from him come this light shining the right side so the judge when he's coming he's not coming to condemn you actually he's coming bringing light [Music] and bringing light to the right side who is on the right side what is the mystery of the right side who sit on the right side to him that will overcome he will sit with me on the throne hallelujah at the right side to which he is looking to so his attention is the right side and not only is he attentive to your life but he's bringing you also light yes sir queen esther what's going on what's going on it has been 30 days i've never been to the king now the king has come you have invited me i'm here what's going on amen the judge to which he's looking and on the cross that is where he looked to the right where he poured on the water in the light of his resurrection we still go forth in his water so when he came he's looking at the right side reminding you that i am giving the last grace to the predestinated seed i am coming from them [Music] you're bringing them light why zechariah 14 but it shall be one day which shall be known to the lord not day no night this morning but it shall come to pass that at the evening time it shall be water that's correct psalm chapter 119 that word is a water a lamp unto mine and the water anti-ma so the light is bringing is the world [Music] he is the one who opened those hills he is those hills for the whole word of god is christ and christ is the seal that was open what is the opening of the seal then revealing cross and the very seven angels which represented the water the light of the moon shall be like the light of the sun and the light of that sun shall be like the light of seven days the light of paul the light of arenas the light of martyr the might of columbus the light of jewishly the light of luther all those lights put together amen and the seventh one was the new one that's why he was bursting like this looking at brother branham you still have one message one message i'm coming with it you already know this but i'm saying all six others were familiar because they were already preached by the messenger hallelujah he is and there is standing there supreme judge showing that he is alpha and the omega the beginning and the end what identification quickening power did that to us he's bringing light in genesis chapter one verse five and god called the light what that's why brother branham said recognizing your recognizing your light and his message recognizing your day and his message because the day was called light hallelujah so the first death struck the body the second death struck the spirit of the soul and the inner man the second death is the lake of fire death and here were cast into the lake of fire which is second death but the fearful the unbelieving and the abominable and the murderer and the whole monger the sorcery the idolater and all liars shall have their part this word part means time in the lake of fire which burn which burn with fire and brimstone we're gonna see this on sunday god's willing which is the second death so the second death is the lake of fire that destroyed the body and the soul but blessed are those that are in the first resurrection because those died in christ hallelujah let's go to the book of jude blessed be the name of the lord the book of jude the mystery of your origin remember the judge has the power to save and the power to destroy he's coming in decent time as a judge that's why he looked he said i justify you it's like you never done again in the first place that decision come from the supreme court with a supreme judge luther could give justification by faith but there was a mysterious part that was locked [Music] all right thank you sister [Laughter] jude verse 1 the servant of jesus christ and brother of james to them to to them that are sanctified by you remember the sanctification of the spirit so judy is talking to who is everybody sleeping is somebody sleeping he's talking to her believers to them that are sanctified by god the father and preserve for judgment preserve in who you see where you are kept that's why the devil cannot find you when the devil uses his radar when he gets to your zone it's black that's why you sleep in peace because as demon are flying in your neighborhood your radar is black hell have no communication you the one opening the communication by watch watching us movie by what you're bringing in your home they say take the high heel kick the high heel you bring the height here you're bringing hell homer amen hallelujah and preserve in jesus christ and call so paul uh jude is talking to the people that have been called sanctified and preserved in christ secure full coverage amen you in good hands not all state amen mercy to you because you're children of water mercy to you and peace because by reconciliation with christ paul said in roman that we made peace with god peace and what love this judge is not coming to condemn you he's looking at the right hand side because that is love leaving he and dying he did what hallelujah mercy to you peace to you spoken word tabernacle love be multiplied bring me more gift multiply that love amen verse 3 who he's talking to who beloved when i gave all diligence to write to you of the common salvation in other words i was getting ready urged to write to you about the common salvation and something happened what happened jude it was needful for me to write to you and exalt you that you should earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered to the water jude is saying here that i was writing to you about the common salvation we all are believer i was trying to write you a letter but the subject i want to insert what i'm trying to speak under this common salvation is i want you to contend for the faith that was once delivered to the center amen because jesus christ says that remember the weak judge by importunity he went and did justice to the widow but when the son of man cometh shall he find what because faith was already in danger amen george begin to tell the believer hold on to that faith hold on to that faith because somebody is trying to destroy the faith but thank god malachi 4 was already prepared amen god already worked proactively by the time that faith will be restored there will be a gentleman in the end time that's going to restore the faith back to the faith of the apostle i shall restore say the lord what the god what what the the the the canker room the palm room all of them what they eat i won't restore jude why do you warn us about this faith what is going on amen verse 4 you there yeah we good for there are certain men crept they didn't enter so when somebody's creeping you know how he's coming amen they crept unaware in other words in the economy of god in the field of god in the field of god there is a net filtration remember in matthew 13 we saw the sower going and sowing the good seed but the enemy waited when everything is dark then he slept unaware and then begin to sow the other seed so in the field of god there are two seed remember the origin ever clear and for thee there are certain men corrupting animals unnoticed these man that crept him let's see the origin you ready who were before old salvation appeared to whom but not all men have do you have faith you should be praising god [Music] amen don't play with your faith it is precious that's why jude said you must contend content means you must fight for it don't play with malachi 4 [Music] amen it is precious to me amen i must fight for that i must complain for that i must stand for that for the message of the hour because the message of the hour is the restoration of the origin of faith that was lost through the edges and if jude said you must fight for it i will fight for it people play with the message amen these people were before of old or then to water do you have a different bible than mine brother when you preach this message he has a different sound [Laughter] hallelujah whoever before of old or damn to this condemnation in other words predestinated to be condemned come on ungodly man you there turning the grace of god into water in other words they have the power to pervert and the one who originally had power to prevent was the devil that's why when jesus looked at the pharisees he said you are of your father the devil these are children of satan but into the message group [Music] hallelujah denying the only lord god and our lord jesus christ he said brother stephen they all believe the message they all believe the deity hold on amen five i will therefore put you in remembrance i'm gonna stop in five then we dig into this then on sunday we pick up on six you ready i will therefore put you in remembrance what do you want to remind us jude your message is stand for your faith because they are infiltration there is a wrong seed that entered anywhere you didn't know they entered they are sitting some of them are even on the pulpit [Music] i'm responsible to this church they are also in the pulpit preaching the message but wrong seed [Music] to whom they were predestinated for condemnation amen remember the other one were completely unbelievers they were only good to you they didn't know because when jesus christ asked them when i was sick you came to see me say where where were you they were they didn't know they were just outside the message [Music] but they respected you but this kind is boastful it's very arrogant and proud you you need the omni the ammunition correct so when you shoo if you see it do you know how to shoot anybody clear all right let's go to verse five i will therefore put you in remembrance jude what is going on though you once knew this i know you know this but let me refresh this what do you want to replace how that the lord having done what can you look at the board the lord having done what okay let's see if this is there the lord having saved the people out of egypt not right away not right away he gave some time after afterward god did what can you look at the board the judge who can save him so when they are pulling people out of egypt there were a certain seed that approached to it they are entering so when the pool it's like a net it's bringing everything out it is up to the feature to sit now and open the net and begin to see who is the correct fish who is that rainbow trout fish that have a rainbow and who was a parasite hallelujah after having served the people out of egypt after all destroyed them that did whatever how did they follow moses but they didn't believe moses to leave egypt you have to put the blood on the lantern everybody these people follow moses so when moses said let's go to the right they went let's go to the left they went let's go to the right the left but surely in their heart they never believe moses [Music] do you follow me when jesus christ came he looked at the pharisee and he put a dna test and he put in a laboratory he said if you have relief moses you should believe me because moses spoke on me so just like your father rejected moses you are of the seed of your father that kills the prophet that destroy the prophet [Music] hallelujah so we see right here that's the coming out of egypt fulfill the saving and also the destruction [Music] who was destroyed them that believe not why they didn't believe why the other one was not destroyed how can 12 spies they're looking at the same thing and one is giving a right report and the other one is giving a wrong report they're seeing the same thing one minute the other give the right report and the other a wrong one yet there were spies jews sent by moses but the dna is wrong judah was chosen by christ preach the gospel cast the devil with the wrong dna as son of hell [Music] origin and second death anybody clear let's see what happened exodus 12 37 and the children of israel surgeon journey from ramesses to sukkot about 600 000 on foot that were men beside children so there were more than none they didn't even say women there and what so when israel moses brought the message and was pulling israel out of egypt when moses pulled his wire somebody crept in his name is a mixed multitude a mixed motivated went up also with them and flocked and heard even much very much cattle because jude is saying there are three people we have them that believed and were saved and marquis we have them that did not believe the unbelievers and they were destroyed and they came out of egypt the third one is pharaoh everybody here so you have your unbeliever your make-believer and your believer number chapter 11 the mixed multi-devils among them fell and lasting who started causing the trouble you see that you see that when the next show does happen a mixed-melted champion and he's the one that's going to cause trouble not at the beginning as you moving in the road and the children of israel also wept again so somebody influenced somebody else then they won't just start the problem they are the one that's parked the fire they are the one that first initiated and the other one just copy carden oh i heard so and so say this i heard so and so and then it's going i heard i heard i heard i heard and before you know it everybody is crying the whole camp is quite who started a mixed multitude anybody clear and the children of israel also wept again and say who shall give us flesh to eat the one who started lasting was somebody else now everybody yeah yeah you're right you're right let's go much we need bread we need bread we need bread who started israel look at the savior at the at the judgment a hidden man said that i judge this man and i see nothing wrong with him amen and the pharisee went into the crowd and tell the people you say give us barabbas and then do what crucified jesus and the people will crucify him crucify him it was not the people it was the mix multiplied behind that were organizing everything be careful in the message hallelujah we remember the fish which we did eat in egypt freely why were you crying then if you were eating fish fish freely why were you screaming lord deliverance lord deliverance you should pray for pharaoh amen the cucumber have you eaten kokuma cucumber the cucumber and the melon and the leek and the onion even onion and the garlic really go in walmart and go buy this stuff amen but now our water is our soul is water dried away there is nothing at all beside this water before our the mixed multitude cause israel to disgust the manner hallelujah israel was receiving manna israel was receiving manna israel come to church on wednesday they give them the manner they come on sunday they give them the manner and they mix multitudes stand up they say no no no no that's too much mysteries mysteries mysteries mysteries mysteries mystery they want you to preach like a baptist they want you to preach like a methodist they begin to remember the garlic mystery don't save people mystery this is just intellectualism [Music] at the voice of the seven engine oh the weapon [Music] you hear they don't approve it it's just intellectualism take it off from the message they're mixed multitude cause israel to discuss the manner israel was eating the manner without any problem somebody came and began to show them that this is not right why every day this this they want you to read their love story [Music] they want to read something outside read a certain book and come on the pulpit i was reading so and so i was reading so and so i was reading so-and-so are you there are you there it's like a minister very good brother told me to say brother stephen i mentioned something about this this this if it's not okay i said brother you coded correct you say you took this from the rubber you explained the origin so that's fine amen but our food the bible says brother branham say the brothers say brother branham say the bible say brother branham say the bible say brother brother i'm saying but the mixed multiple cause israel to believe that manner this is too much now people in the message begin to run for skim milk they want to sit in the church when the the they preach like joe austin they preach like tv checks we don't have pd checks message we have the message of william mario branham the message of the hour a mixed-motive in the manner what was manner [Music] hallelujah what was manner and the people speak against god and guess who [Music] who caused this when israel requested another king samuel went to god and began to cry god told samuel it is not you that they're rejecting they are actually rejecting me rejecting moses is rejecting god [Music] let me help you up rejecting william mayan pranam is rejecting god god said i have come down to go to egypt who saw him when when when when who was talking to pharaoh did you see god there why didn't god speak himself squirrel why didn't god speak himself why did he need a man let me [Music] hallelujah wherefore have you brought us out of egypt to die in the water was that the message of moses did moses tell them you're going to die in the wilderness [Music] for there is no bread neither there is any what i thought the rock was following them amen and our soul did what loved this what they discus they hated manner they begin to call it light bread amen and the lord sent fairy serpent among the people and they beat the people and much people of israel did what what is manner [Music] and they he had some seven years and had rained down manner upon them to do what and giving them of the water so mana is what the very bread of heaven was manner let me drive it home man did eat water he sent to them meat to the water and this constellation was made of water seven water seven course meal and your food because there is a light coming from the constellation which is the word of god the angel food the message of the hour came which was ancient food because the message was brought by angels [Music] but a mixed malted caused the people to disgust the message [Music] hallelujah the people of israel when you say moses say they all stand up you say moses said they all stand up everybody [Music] when jesus talked to them he said moses said moses said moses said what's wrong with the people in the message you say brother branham say and they're still discussing with you you can show somebody five code 10 code this is the way brother branham say by the brand i'm saying and still they are still resisting the code and yet claiming to be believer or claiming to be preaching the message hallelujah discussing angel food amen but it become burden oh this old light bread angel's bread well what do we care about this old bread our souls love this stuff and everything is what [Music] so everything in the message became wrong when you were eating that at the beginning you will sweet who caused you to disgust the message hallelujah our soul loved this stuff and this old manner that falls out every night why we would rather have some garlic and leak out of egypt you see the water was nothing for the water [Music] because they were ordained to a condemnation [Music] are you there are you there just as god the lord that brother branham there is a coral and death and that has been loaded also in the exodus to help pull that crowd out and destroy it [Music] hallelujah and when a man or a woman begin to complain about going to church they get so tired of going to church they are not ready for the journey there is something wrong somewhere [Music] hallelujah hallelujah if i touch you a methodist message it won't take no effect on you hallelujah so by causing you to disgust the manna they are actually blocking your breath and your progression because god identified each age with a message [Music] hallelujah this is goddamn if moses taught the message of noah it would take no effect if jesus taught moses message it would take what no effect because the predestinated seed are laying there that will only be watered by that type of water that is give for that you were programmed for the message of the hour there is no other message that can quicken that can make your heart burn except the message of the hour when they give you skim milk it doesn't taste good you put it in two minutes you hungry again because they're giving you below cheap stuff amen it won't grow any other condition it must be the condition that grows it it must be the appropriate manner america but what did the mixed multitude do they begin to discuss the message you preach the message where are you coming with this thing where did you get it by the point i'm saying it brother branham say it by the brand i'm saying brother branham say this is what happened 20 years sitting we become baptist message method this message behave the only outside is your skirt and everything but you talk to somebody it's not different than a baptist skin milk mysteries mysteries mystery music i heard but i understood not daniel heard the trenders but he didn't understand then i said oh my lord what shall be the end of these things i want to know what it is and he said go that way daniel for the world are closed up and still till the time of the wedding these mysteries are not for you daniel my boy go to sleep this is for the end time there is a prophet predestinated in the end time for this stuff john they opened the same thing john we want to write god say don't write this don't write this keep this do what seal it so if you so the seal contains something so if you break the seal a thunder pop-up instead of riding the thunder they sealed the tunnel so the thunder was inside the sea so for you to know the thunder you must break the seal then they still release the thunder the thunder roll seven people john said god said close close leave everything amen what will those thunder do what will that end your food do watch many shall be what purified by water which word so if you don't preach the message what do you expect for people to be purified with many shall be purified and made what and do what you must be in the church that challenge you you must sleep under a ministry that try and challenge your faith until you feel like it's like every day i gotta grow up yes you gotta grow up i thought i'm 20 years in the message i thought i'm 15 years in the message i thought i'm 20 years in the message when the message began to come it is shaking everything what is what has been shaking is your religious part god is pulling that off it looks like you don't understand we are understanding you it is god shaking you get those high heel off get this off get the tragedies of get this it is challenging challenge and the more challenge you get you are actually approaching something purifying you not a judge to destroy you a judge to save you by the word people want to sit in the church that doesn't challenge their life where their life are cuddle they go to church they go out they fine because nobody touch where they are [Music] but the message was programmed for this hour so the message knows everything that you go through and the message must be preached in its purity because he knows what is going on in the life of the people [Applause] go to a convention you come back oh he was good did he challenge you what challenge you what make you go home and sit down and ponder what make you go home after that convention and sit down and begin to read more the scripture or after the convention send back life again we go out and eat and talk and joke the people ate and rose to pray israel drink eat talk talk and roast to play no challenge this one no no every day every day every day every day every day poop out peep out don't want to be challenged but the mystery must try you that try you must be judged here not to be judged over there that's why they are trying you they are judging you they are shaking you telling you forget everything look at this look at this look at this look and the more you surrender the more power because power is made perfect his strength is made perfect when you become weak he's weakening your humanity weakening weakening we can weaken until you begin to depend on him [Music] how can you trust him you he slayed you do you trust somebody who slay you but pork job said though he slammed he knew what was that slaying doing he was not slaying job he was slaying the enemy of job the greatest enemy of william marion branham is william marion branham though he slayed me though he slayed that enemy i'll trust him slay that guy hallelujah many shall be tried but the wicked shall do wickedly and none of the wicked shall water because there is nothing in them to understand there is nothing in them to decode no revelation but the what wisdom shall what who went into the rapture the foolish virgin order hallelujah hallelujah my god i gotta stop half i gotta stop i thought i'm gonna finish this today but half amen the bible says that when israel was eating the lamb in egypt in what condition were they eating dilemma you said brother pranam say and people are looking at you like this brother why did you do this no the prophet said this this this and they're just looking at you like you're saying nothing because a mixed multitude believer the manner amen and that's shall you eat it with your lunch water your shoes on your and your stuff in your and you shall eat it in what the message should be when the preaching the people are on fire you are eating the message not calmly you should eat the message in an uncomfortable situation that uncomfortable situation is the growing home it was the living of egypt going to the promised land that makes you nervous what else can we do what what what you you you want the expectation for the coming of the lord it make you eat the message you want to get it you excited you're eating it with all preparation anytime the lord can come i'm ready to go that's the way the message should be received [Music] not we sit in church and we sit like this like conference you finish and then people woke up it was good it was good it was good it was good the message was good yeah it was good yeah yeah he preached good amen there is no urgency there is no fear there is no enthusiasm to receive the word because somebody belittle it because some preacher belittle it you go read it a little bit you go home you read it a little bit you go 20 years in the message you ask one question they don't know this you ask this they don't know this you ask this they don't know you hack the basics of the message you don't know where were you under all these 20 years where were you under all these 10 years now when they bring something where is this coming from it was in the tapes it was in the book it was in the scripture but a mixed-melted a mixed multitude calls it amen yeah i gotta stop here this is too deep let's stand yeah if i get here it's another 30 minutes amen i thought i'm gonna finish this then we get the other one so keep it there in june chapter 5 and verse 5 it says that after the left egypt two seed one was destroyed that did not believe what made them not to believe what because the scripture says here that the grace of salvation appeared to all men but not all men have what what makes this one not to
