exhorted maybe 30 minutes and pray for the children and I'm waiting for a successful year where everybody will do good in school because God wants us to prosper even in school as our soul continue to prosper amen on August the 12th which is next week next uh Saturday I don't know why I'm having this it's the devil fighting but anyway I'm gonna preach uh August the 12th which is next Saturday we will have a question and answer and the address will be sent brother Kelly throughout the week so 2 30 again next week next Saturday we have a question and answer and then on August the 26th is a young sister's meeting it's a follow-up on the meeting we have for five hours or something I believe I got your question I don't know which question is lingering again so don't bring me the question at the last minute I was expecting your question and we will go over and make sure we understand everything clearly amen for the Young's man we announced on September another date but it was requested if we can change the date to September 2nd for the Young's main meeting is that okay with you is that okay with you okay you deal with your youth leader back there but I did uh we were communicated less late last night about September 2nd and make sure you send me your question please as soon as possible so make sure I have them and I'll go over them so we can go ahead and follow up on those questions amen amen can you still hear me glory to God Amen and uh one more for those who are waiting for teachers had to pray please be patient with us it's a missionary season we try to line up as much as we can and then we come back again and continue amen uh the young man had some fellowship among themselves so as a father my daughters brought a complaint and they say the young men are getting the fellowship together and we're not getting any Fellowship so they want also to have their day where they can meet together as young sisters and just have Fellowship together so I'm working on that and Speaker of the House you go ahead and check the date for me and give me the available date where all of you are going to be there so we will see what we can do amen so as a father I have to balance everything together and the young men were telling me that brother Stephen they have four meeting we only have one or two so I'm having men's and sisters here going back and forth so I will try the best that I can to balance everything up so I don't get any trouble and say you're not fair not fair but fur and then before I get this is not fair amen so I would do my best very interesting we got a very group day a good very interesting group back there but as a father I have to stay tenacious until I win and I did win because I was the last one to send the response they know what I'm talking about they are in their chat group so that's my time that I spent with my family so when my wife is doing something or shopping I just sit there and just go ahead with my children and make sure they're all doing okay if you have a problem when I say children you see me I will give you scripture because Paul called Timothy his son in the gospel we clear so far so I believe everything is clear Brother David brother Caleb if you can mute me for two minutes only and then we can come back online again amen amen so I do fight I fight on a puppet I fight on the back I fight back and forth until I make sure I clear everybody here amen because if God puts you under my Ministry I don't want anybody to touch you before they touch you they need to touch me in other words they need to talk to me first before they handle you amen amen so if somebody handle you and you begin to fight that's your problem don't fight come back and see me and let me handle him amen we covered 100 let's stand for the reading of the word glory to God amen Glory Glory let's go to the Book of Ezekiel well they take her working there we exited a little bit now we're back again on the highway amen same scripture I'm using them over again because we had to exit because of the evidence of the Holy Spirit if you dare you can say Amen Ezekiel 36. glory to God verse 24 back again to the same thing the Bible say for I will take you from Among the Hidden I don't know how deep I will go with this but I have to lay some scripture down as I'm moving amen for I will take you from Among the Hidden you understand this now because we were all Among the Hidden amen and gather you out of all countries that's why the bread is coming from different countries amen and will bring you into your own land which is the promised word of the hour amen then I will sprinkle clean water upon you we know that this is spiritual because Israel was not sitting there in God sprinkling water on them you might be seated and you shall be clean we know the water is the word we already went through this from all your filthiness and from all your adults will acquaint you amen verse 26 and a new heart also will I give you so the target of God like we spoke three weeks ago is the heart amen God's Target is the heart that's why when Malachi 4 is coming amen the very Target of Malachi 4 is to turn the heart we clear he say a new heart also will I give you and a new spirit will have put within you amen and I would take away the Stony heart out of your flesh and I will give you a heart of Flesh everybody clear verse 27. and I will put my spirit within you and cause you to walk in my statue so the whole purpose of this surgery this heart transplant is just to make sure you got the right heart and God want to dwell in in other words we started with a wrong heart amen you remember that right so God wanted to Target the heart and clean this heart do a heart transplant give us a heart but not just a heart God want to dwell in the heart for which purpose the Bible says in verse 28 that you shall uh verse 27 that I will put my spirit within you so the spirit need to be inside the heart and when the spirit come within the heart God wants his spirit inward amen within the heart and cause you to walk in my statute so if you are walking in the statute of God what cause you to do that the spirit of the Lord amen so this spirit will cause you to walk I have to go with this word one by one today amen to walk in my statute comma and you shall do want to keep my judgment so who's keeping the judgment who's causing you to keep the Judgment spirit it causes you to keep in other words we were unable to keep his touches and his Commandments amen without the spirit of the Lord you won't do it it will be legalistic you will be doing that for fear because if you don't do it you get a whooping but truly you don't want to do it amen that's what happened to Israel they were doing it because if they don't do it they get killed an eye for an eye amen and he says and you shall keep my judgment Karma and what do them so the walking again the keeping and the doing all comes from the Holy Spirit keep these three words walk keep and do we need to see how they're going to be fulfilled amen once the spirit comes and you begin to walk you begin to keep you begin to do what follows verse 28 and you shall dwell in the land that I gave to your father and you shall be my people and I will be your what God because you belong to God and God belongs to you you're going to see it sooner amen verse 29 I will also save you from all your uncleanness and I will call for the what corn now the blessing begin to come amen and we'll do what increase it and lay no famine upon you so the blessing followed the indwelling of the spirit in your life amen that's why we seek ye first the kingdom of God then what will follow will be the blessings because God wants you to prosper because we know what is in the heart really is your soul amen God wants you to prosper and to be in good health as you so we clear the verse 30 and I will do what multiply the fruit of the tree and increase of and the increase of the field that you shall receive no more water Repro of famine among the water so in other words there will be a distinction completely between you and the hidden they will tell by the way God is working in your life by the way God is blessing you somebody will look and say truly you got a good God you have a living God amen so the world needs to see that amen glory to God let's go to mark 11. amen blessed be the name of the Lord Mark 11. if you dare you can say amen I have to add this back again because I'm going to make a point verse 12 and on tomorrow when we when they were come from Bethany he was hungry amen amen and seeing a fig a far off having leaves he came if happily amen he must find anything their own so Jesus was not sure he found he thought he's going to find something there amen and when he came to it he found nothing but water leave for the time of figs was not yet in other words it was not the season amen so there is a season for for everything amen but Jesus had the desire out of the season maybe one day I will teach you on seasons okay you need to understand season because if you don't understand season you can get in trouble in the future do you know what I'm talking about have you ever noticed sometime in your life like everything works nice yes and then suddenly he stopped and then you go to trial trial trial or child and after a while you open up again because it seasons everybody okay so when things are working right you need to wake up and seize the season let me leave season alone amen maybe one day I will sit with you and go into detail do you know that the dream of pharaoh have two seasons oh yeah huh there was a season of abundance and there was a season of famine and in the season of abundance you had to do something you cannot just be enjoying amen everybody okay when everything is in abundance you better do something you enjoy but you need to keep okay one day we will talk about season let me go back to my stuff so there is a natural season I will show you one day where the season is there is a natural season that goes with the course of the event it's a natural season amen and there is also a spiritual season amen this one override this one amen this spiritual season when it hits he doesn't care what is going on in your natural season how can Jesus go to a tree hey that doesn't have fruit and expecting to find fruit out of Caesar how and because he didn't find the fruit he didn't stop there and say you know what it is the season let me leave it alone let me wait for the season Jesus didn't wait for the season he wanted to have what he wants even though it is out of season everybody okay because if you go to the Book of Revelation there is a tree of life do you know that and the Tree of Life don't have season do you know that how many knows it raise your hand so I make sure you're good okay for those who don't know you ask the one who know who knows amen the tree of life every month produce fruit so you can go every month every year all the time of the year and you can get fruit amen but these three are natural tree amen sometimes they do have fruit sometimes they don't have fruit depending on the season everybody okay and Jesus went out of season amen and when he found no fruit out of season an anointing kick him [Music] a turd pull anointing came out of season out of Natural season the Colorado Storm could be changed by the temple the third pool can change the season [Music] even if if it's spoken that it's gonna snow the third pool can come and flip the season and make the sun shine for three days [Applause] have I lost someone do you know when brother Branham created the square he was in a bad weather that he cannot have any Square amen God didn't say I'm gonna tell squares where they hiding to come out no God created square that don't care about the weather the creation forced those Square to come out despite the bad weather because the square have to leave for a short time because they need to receive a bullet [Applause] [Music] everybody okay everybody okay so even so the season of this world is now really a problem you need to know the season of God let me just continue before you come to church you need to pray okay you need to pray you need to take time inside and pray so when we get here you are already in the spirit because God doesn't speak for speaking his word will never return to him for you you need to tell God I don't want that that sermon to pass me by and go back to you without accomplishing that which you said before in other words I'm not gonna leave this place without receiving what you have for me amen tell your neighbor I didn't bring you out to church here I came to get my blessing and I'm gonna live with my blessing so don't worry about your neighbor everybody okay if there is one person to receive a blessing that will be me verse 14 and Jesus answering and say to it no man eat fruit of you Hereafter for water ever and he's disappointed water heard it did they treated anything on verse 20. if you can go with me let me drop down to 22 so we can save time and Jesus answering said to them have water faith in God for verily I say unto you that whatsoever whosoever shall say to this mountain be you water removed can you move a mountain a tree you can move a tree okay can you go to Kings Mountain and say okay today we're gonna move you so Jesus is taking that faith and hook it to something that is impossible in other words it's a faith that doesn't care about what the natural law says [Applause] he say and constant and be you cast into the sea and shall not that way in his heart do you see where that faith is coming the target is where [Music] do you see where that faith is coming from amen yes so this heart must produce faith so where is this Faith coming from amen that those things which he shall say come to pass he shall have whatsoever he would say whatsoever means whatsoever so ever mean to whatsoever so don't put don't don't don't don't fill in my whatsoever okay don't come with your faith and try to poke that on me that brother Stephen you can only ask this my whatsoever is different than your whatsoever amen [Applause] if you're whatsoever it's more like this don't bug me in the ear all the time [Applause] because brother Branham say ask for big things amen [Applause] you should be free at this time amen verse 24 go my friend therefore I say to you what feels so ever you water desire not my question you see how I can preach this I don't know if I your desire comes from where the heart my my my in French they say so in English oh okay amen so if you sit quiet and suddenly you desire something [Applause] Lord help me which way I'm trying to reach [Applause] whatsoever you desire when you water pray believe that you what you receive them and you shall do whatever have them so thank you amen amen amen let me get a tone do you desire thorn why because it's gonna do what to you it's going to hurt you amen so what you desire is what is something that is bad to you or something that is bad did you get it so what you love they taught brother Branham whatever you love go away [Applause] is it a differently am I saying a different quote they thought brother Brown I mean the sixth Dimension whatever you love and God kept a chair in the sixth dimension because brother Branham regretted that chair so much [Applause] even the dog foreign because brother Branham loves the dog [Applause] so how did the dog enter into the sixth Dimension because in the sixth Dimension nothing entered there but perfect love who gave to the dog perfect love who gets the dog perfect love he said God can enter death how much more me amen amen amen like this goes into the sixth dimension is the chair in the image of God is the chair in the lightness of God no sir [Applause] please let's go to James chapter one oh God help me glory to God we have a powerful message [Applause] the people in the message don't even realize the message that they have this message I can try to pull a tooth and it's blocking me and I remember what brother Branham was doing and I do the same thing and the truth pop up I've seen that over and over the and I've seen the tooth coming up like this and I just grab it and they say wow you're a good dentist [Applause] when I use Maggie it doesn't work I just switch and when he used his gear he's the best dentist ever oh yeah and I learned these things by Brother Branham let's go to James chapter one the first father [Laughter] never play with this message never play this with this man even if you don't understand it just say Amen that's it verse 5 if any of you lack water wisdom let him do what ask of God that give to all men how liberal you remember that right an upgraded water nah you remember that right and it shall be water given him and let him ask how in faith so the point is you have to do everything by faith because without faith it is impossible but how can I get safe that's the key he says and let him ask by water in faith not what wavering for he that waivers is like a wave of the sea driven with the water the wind and the water glory to God verse 7 for let that not the man the man that is wavering think that he shall what receive anything from the water the Lord so if you are wavering God won't give you anything but we don't want to waver anymore what do we do job to verse 17 please glory to God if you dare you can say amen amen every water good gift no torn you remember that I'm no turn every water good gift and what every perfect gift is from who above so if I want to get good stuff and stuff that are perfect I need to receive information and comes water down so they coming out down they are there and they're coming they're coming down the way when they're coming down where are they going you're dangerous now amen amen so when it's coming down from above it is coming and dropping somewhere and the target is the heart and whatever job there is good amen and it's even perfect and it's usually a gift amen from your father above in other words daddy chose to drop a deposit and when you look you look what is this money doing here you need to learn that he didn't come just like that it is Daddy who send it amen you need to take the money they purchase power and use it amen glory to God and come down from the father of what light the Father of Lights so there is many lights and he's the father of those lights in other words when he give birth he give birth to likes his children looks like likes their their father there is a light [Applause] you see him he's the light his children also look like that amen so he's the father of light that's why in the day of Pentecostal when he came and he sees how many children are am I having there 120 then he birth 120 likes amen and God's light went and sat on top of the disciple and enter them [Applause] okay amen with whom is no water in other words this is a 100 guarantee it is not a place where you file an application and you are hesitant whether it's going to work or not it will always work especially if you know that it's our father [Applause] it is the father of light Jesus said when you pray say our father very good can I continue amen need the shadow of water turning so he won't play around with you [Music] let's go to verse 18. of whom of his own will he what began begat of father he has with the word of water truth so the father birth you by the word you remember last Sunday right that we should be a kind of water first fruits of his water creature so God when he birth you he wants you to be first fruit amen why do you have to be faithful why Paul says this in Colossians chapter one he says who is water the image of the water invisible God the water first born of every water creature so Jesus was the firstborn of every creature and we know that first born was the pillar of fire amen which was the logos everybody okay amen watch First Corinthians chapter 15 verse 23 the Bible say but every man in his own water order cross the water first through if he's the first fruit he wants you also to be the first fruit because you are his wife amen the first fruit will marry the first fruit that's why he him and his wife are one Adam and Eve were one amen Adam is the one who gave birth to evil of Adam and when Adam looked he said this is now and water Flesh of My Feet in other words she's exactly me and God being the first fruit want us to be also wanted [Music] everybody okay First Peter chapter 1 verse 23 being how born again not of what corruptible but which color which seed of Incorruptible by the water word the word of God which liveth and abideth house forever so you are gonna be born like God was born and God being born was the first fruit of everything so his wife must be at his level that's why let this mind that was also in Christ beware in you that you and Christ are equal Queen Esther asked up to the half of the Kingdom the kingdom have to be divided in half he takes 50 we take 50 because we are joints here the Bible say in the Book of Revelation that the tree of life is on either side of the river how can one tree be on either side of the river it is a female and a male tree that are put together and they are on either side of the river the Bible said one tree but that tree is only the side of the river how can one tree be on either side of the river thank you if you put one tree here another tree here you put in two trees but it's one tree it's a tree that does this but it joins together like this it is a male and a female [Applause] [Music] [Applause] and the two become one so he is the I'm just taking an example to make sure because that's the language we understand now when we say I love you so one side is coming and one love and the two are joining to form one heart there will be one flesh the two shall be any question let's pray then Heavenly Father Lord we are approaching you again this morning Father thanking you once again for your grace for your love and your mercy and for everything you have been doing for us father thank you for the presence of your spirit this morning and giving us an ability and the opportunity to be able Lord to Fellowship together with scent of like Precious Faith father I have done what a man can do with the ability that you can give him but now I've prayed Lord that you move me completely out of the way may you come and speak to this church those that are visible and invisible because we know that your children is prayed all over the world we committed unto their hand be the Alpha and the Omega remove every demonic spirit away from us father in the name of Jesus Christ amen my subject this morning is the four phases of roof as we promised faith and love for our resources everybody okay faith and love for our resources so we are back again on the highway on the last phase of roof which is roof rewarded where we are preparing to uh for the takeoff of roof to leave the natural tabernacle into the spiritual Tabernacle amen three weeks ago we talked about the great commandment and according to the great commandment Jesus spoke of two Commandments that are joined together and Jesus said that great commandment number one is to love God amen with all our heart all our mind all our souls and the second commandment is to love one another amen or to love your neighbor as yourself amen and if you look at those Commandments the first love belonged to God everybody okay it is the love toward the groom or it is the love of the king everybody okay but the second commandment which is joined or connected to it is not about loving God it is loving one another or your neighbor this love is the bride's love all the love of the queen and the queen is made of many members but God is only one God hear your Israel the Lord your God is one God but when it comes to the bread Jesus said love one another because the Bread is made of many people in other words the first commandment Target the king and the second commandment Target the queen and the two Commandments are together because the king and the Queen Are One everybody okay have I lost anyone have I lost anyone in other words when you are fulfilling the loving of God it is toward the king but the loving of one another is you being a member of the Bride you will find out that you are not the only member of the Bride you have other member of the bride and as being are the member of the blood we need to love each other it is a love within the bread amen but the bride and the groom cannot be separated that's what Jesus said the second commandment is like unto the first because this is the pillar of fire we also have Pillar of Fire this is the father of light and these are the lights from the father or the sons of God so we together are joined together into one everybody good so far everybody good so far then we found out that the way our heart were created we were created wrong because our hearts were created with a foreskin you remember that right the Bible says in Deuteronomy I'm keeping this a little bit so we can take off that circumstance therefore the water for skin of your heart and be no more water stiff neck because our heart was Stony heart bad heart amen and the circumcision Paul explained to us that it's done by the Holy Spirit in Deuteronomy 30 verse 6 the Bible say and the Lord that God will do whatever circumcise so the one who circumcised the heart is not a man it is God himself that comes in the form of the Holy Spirit and circumcise or chop off the nature that you were born with that was a bad nature and remove that nature away for a purpose everybody okay and and Moses says that the Lord that God will circumcised that heart and the Heart of the water see to do water love the Lord thy God with all done water and without water so and we found that water strength in other word to fulfill this commandment you need a circumcision from God God have to come in the form of the Holy Spirit and circumcise your heart and then the Holy Spirit Will begin to produce love everybody good now we talked about our circles here you remember these circles amen the last thing right here is a seed and in this seed we got potential amen and we found out that that seed had eternal life you remember that and that eternal life we found also that Paul explained to us that the seed had the love of God you remember that amen and the Capstone Revelation that was coming up was also the love of God amen so it was love coming to love and when the true love meets the king and the Queens are married together let's go to John chapter 14 as we begin to climb if I pass this then I'm beginning to move faster John chapter 14. glory to God follow me carefully please so we can go John 14 verse 15. if you dare you can say Amen everybody there Jesus says this if you do what love me Kama do what keep my commandment so there is no way you can keep his commandment if you don't love him amen everybody okay so the love of God will cause you to keep his Commandments amen amen everybody okay but remember in Ezekiel the one who calls you to keep the Commandment is the spirit of God we okay let me go back again he says if you love me keep my Commandments amen prayer verse 16 and ah will pray the father and he shall give you what another comforter that he made a bad with you forever Jesus begin to talk about the keeping of his commandment and he said the keeping of his commandment goes with the love of God and after that Jesus begin to give the promise of the holy spirit in other words you won't keep the Commandment if the Holy Ghost is not there everybody okay job to voice uh uh are we on first uh drop to verse 17. even the spirit of Truth whom the world cannot water receive receive because he sees him no need and knows him but you but you know him for he you are with you and shall beware in you he shall be because the disciple didn't have the Holy Ghost that Jesus that's why Jesus said he shall be he's dwelling with you I'm here but he shall because you have to wait till Pentecost for the spirit to come in you everybody okay so far job to verse 18. I will not leave you comfortless or as orphans I will come to you yet a little while and the world sees me no more by you see me because Ali you shall live also watch carefully I'm getting there at that day you shall know that I am in my father and you in me and I wear in you at that time Jesus was with them Jesus was not in them but he said wait for that day you will realize that I'm inside of you we okay watch now verse 21. he that has my commandment and keeps them he it is that do what loveth me and he that loveth me shall be love of my father and I will love him and will manifest myself toward him so before God manifests himself to you or reveal himself to you you must have a portion of love [Applause] can I read it over again let's go back again on verse 21. he that hell that has my commandment and keeps them he it is that what love is me so first you must have a portion of love remember your seed got that love I know what I'm talking about we okay now and then if you love him me and he that love me shall be loved by water so they love in you will push something into the father everybody okay and I will love him and will manifest myself to water him manifest me to reveal myself to you in other words love from you woke up to love in God and when the true love begin to synchronize God understand who he has to reveal himself to amen [Applause] amen I'm gonna say it again you have a receiver God is essential God sent signal amen when the signal of God come in your life your receiver will react amen when God understands that he is in the receiver God knows that this is the one that I have to give the Holy Ghost amen this is the one that I need to reveal myself to him this is the one that I need to give the new birth because he got a portion of me in him in other words eternal life is in you I can give you eternal life love is in you that's why I can give you love the word is in you that's why the word can come to you but if God sends signal and there is no response the holy spirit will now reveal himself because he only revealed himself to his children amen [Applause] job to verse 23 amen Jesus answered and said to him if a man do what love me he will do what keep my word and my father will do what love him and we will come after the true love have talked after you love and the father responded after the two asynchronous they cleared the past they say hey this is a correct seed you can go ahead and move on everybody okay we see that if a man loves me he will keep my word and my father will do what love him in response to your love and we will come and do water and make will come unto him and make our water Abode with him so before the Holy Spirit can come and dwell in you they have a check they have to do they have a test they have to do Amanda God will come and said something amen even in your bad state even as sinful as you are there won't be something in you that only love God [Applause] everybody okay that's why the thief had the closet as bad as he could be he could take sad for Jesus Christ yet he's bad because in him there is something to love God there is something to stand for God that is what God is looking for when God receives that response God understand that this is the one that I need to give the Holy Ghost that's why Jesus said if you love The Father the father will love you and once we pass the test then me and the father will come and make our dwelling in you everybody good so far we good so far let's go to chapter 15. if I cross this chapter we begin to climb amen chapter 15. it is just stabilizing whoever didn't get it last Sunday amen verse 7 if you dare you can say amen amen watch that if you abide in me and my word a bad word in you you shall do water ask what you will and it shall be water down unto you keep that in place drop to verse 10. if you do water keep my commandment you shall abide in my love even as I have kept my father's commandment and abide in water his love we clear that job to verse 12. this is my commandment that you love one another as I have water love you how can the disciple love one another the way Jesus loved them because the love Jesus Christ's head for them was agape love how can you love like Jesus love you so you must have agape love for you to Love Like Jesus Christ everybody okay verse 13 greater love has water no man then this that a man lay down his life for who his friends how can you lay down your life for somebody watch Paul here John says this we know that we have passed from death and to life because we love the brethren he the love if not his brother a bad fuel in death whosoever ahead of his brother is water a murderer and ye know that no murderer have water eternal life abiding where in him so for you to have eternal life abiding in you you must produce love we're not talking about Christian Science love remember we're talking about our capitals we already cleared that one hereby perceive with the love of God because he did water lay down his life for who us and we ought to lay down our life for the water Brethren this is what Jesus is requiring for to you for for you to lay your life down for your brother you cannot do it with your feel your love it's only agape love can do that because the love of God did that in Jesus Christ so you cannot do that by your female love only agape love will take a bullet for someone else [Applause] everybody okay job to verse 16. you have not water chosen me but I have done what I've chosen you and did what ordained in other words I have predestinated you amen that you should go and do what bring forth through so you have been programmed to bring forth fruit amen if you need to bring forth fruit you must be first a seed [Applause] everybody okay everybody okay everybody okay the one who bring forth fruit is a seed that seed need to be planted and be quickened and begin to grow and begin to bring forth fruit and brother Branham said every fruit that you will have is already in the seed in other words your seed here got potential [Applause] everybody okay God program you to bring forth fruit amen amen and the fruit that you will bring will come in season amen [Music] everybody okay if you have an apple tree every year it will continue to bring Apple it doesn't bring all the Apple in one time he bring it as you progress Amana so all your potential don't come out in one time as you begin to grow in the Lord after a while God brings fruits after while God brings fruit after a while God brings fruits right so your potential coming season amen Jesus Amen in 2023 you got protection if the Lord tell me they got potential for 24. amen one is 24 God's potential will begin to come out amen [Applause] let me continue to clamber he said that you should bring forth water fruits and that's your fruit to do water should we man amen that whatsoever you see he comes back again whatsoever amen how are you talking about bringing fruit remember the tree that Jesus so was supposed to bring fruit in its season but that was not the season so whatsoever get in place everybody okay there is this Natural season and there is a spiritual season when Jesus Christ came and it was not the season naturally for the tree to bring forth fruit Jesus used a different season everybody okay and here Jesus is saying that I already programmed you to bring forth fruit so there are stuff in your life whether the devil like it or not when it's the season of God it will come out [Applause] everybody okay but if it's not the season and the desire come out then whatsoever you ask in season another season amen when it's not the time for the square then the third full kick in if it's the time for square the third pool is quiet you go ahead and shoot the square [Music] [Applause] have I lost anyone have Allah said one so in season another season we are covered here we okay so far let me continue verse 16 and that your fruit should remain that whatsoever you shall ask the father in my name he made water give it to you everybody clear so far watch this now as we clamber John say beloved let us do what love one another for Love Is water of God and everyone that loveth is born of water God so for you to love you must be birthed by God and know God and to know him his life he that love is not know if not who God because God is what love we clear on that glory to God and he that keepeth his commandment dwelleth in him and he in him and hereby we know that he God a by death in Us by the spirit which he has not given us watch again I'm gonna drop quickly there no man has seen God at any time if we love one another God dwelleth where in us so to fulfill that commandment God have to dwell in you and his love is perfected well in US hereby know we that we dwell in him and he in us because he has given us what of his spirit hope maketh not a shame because the love of God is shared abroad in our hearts by who the Holy Ghost which is given what so when the Holy Ghost come in your life the Holy Ghost dispatch love amen are we okay now so when the spirit of God get into you Paul is saying well get in your heart not in your head it will create love we know that this love is a gap in love amen why do you need this Agape alone everybody okay we saw three weeks ago that collusion say above all these things amen put on Water charity which is the bond of water perfectness amen so when the Holy Spirit enter your heart it will dispatch the love of God and love and love will hit together and love and love marry together and God seals you forever no matter death angel principalities or whatever nothing shall separate you from the water love of God which is where in Christ you are hooked forever we okay now we okay now so after the love is established after you are stabilizing Christ after now you belong to God God belonged to you you and God are one what follows it and why do we need that love first we okay now we okay brother Branham says this I read this last week I heard brother Matthew said this morning someone might have been asking him why did inter preach on the Holy Ghost why didn't that do this here it is the Holy Ghost is water the action so when the Holy Ghost get in your life and connect with you and seals you and stabilize you and establish the bond of perfection the Holy Ghost cannot stay quiet [Applause] because what happened is point zero you remember that amen the Holy Spirit Will begin to react in your life come here Lord help me amen the Holy Ghost is the water action in you it is air alive not an emotion not some sort of a fleshly evidence but it is a water a person a person of who Jesus Christ the word of God established where in your heart to do water Quicken every word of water so every time you're listening to the tip of brother Branham the Holy Spirit Will begin to digest the table and give you more nutrient and you begin to grow in the word of the edge [Applause] everybody okay watch the Holy Ghost how in action not so much in water demonstration because Judah can demonstrate you stuff many will come in my name and say Lord Lord have we not cast our devil and God said I never knew you so not so much on demonstration but watch the action in other words the Holy Spirit Will begin to do work amen not so much in demonstration but in water action what he does according to the water why why is this action important why do we need the Holy Spirit after establishing us in Christ why does the why is not the Holy Spirit remaining quiet God wants you to prosper watch what's going on brother Branham say God made the promise that he would do what bless [Applause] but them blessings are under conditions [Applause] another word for you to get something out of God you must meet the requirement [Applause] let's continue you get to meet those conditions to make that water work amen let's go here now we found out that God promised to do water supply all of our need all of our need we have need of in this water Journey we all know that but how do we get those needs amen is that right congregation say Amen but remember he only supplies it how on conditions we got to meet his condition first if we do not meet his condition he will not meet our condition we got to do the things that is right first got to go down to the bottom and build up that's exactly we can start at the top and come down we get to go from water and begin to do water build up and go back to the water he shall meet our water all his promises are how unconditioned that's why you must seek first the kingdom of God put God first give him the preeminence first start from the bottom first correct your life first then we can begin to go up amen everybody good amen everybody good so the point here is every promise that is in the Bible is under condition [Applause] what is that have to do with the love of God let me continue brother Branham say so does the blessing of this last day he belongs to who this church we don't have any problem with that but it is how under condition you got to meet those conditions if you don't you can have all kind of healing services shouting Services pricing Services fruit Services speaking in tongue Services no good [Applause] you can have our convention that you want he won't do you no good because you have to work according to the guideline [Applause] everybody okay you get to come to God's what condition god promise I'll always have unconditional you must have absolutely no matter how fundamental you are with the promise it is on the house how many times always how we could stop here and work through the scripture back and forth hours see that the condition in who is what means water something you can be just as fundamental as you want to but it's underwater condition by the water the promise and water predestination remember you are predestinated to bear fruit [Applause] but every promise of God is under condition amen brother Stephen we understand now that everything God have for us is under condition now can you tell us those conditions so we know that if we meet those conditions now we're clear before God everybody okay everybody okay everybody good but remember when the Holy Spirit Come he will make you do water and do water he and do water do open Deuteronomy 28. we want to know the conditions amen we have to go like a Sunday School if you dare you can say Amen because if we run quickly you come out you don't understand anything and tomorrow you will be flipping convention to Convention churches to churches preachers to preachers until that preacher disappoints you because you're looking at the wrong thing you need to focus on the word Deuteronomy 28 uh if you dare you can say amen amen every every Promises of God are under condition clear watch again and it shall come to pass water if stop did you see that so before God begin to talk about the blessing God put if so everything that I'm about to

you going to do his commandment how are you going to do it diligently you need somebody to help you do the Commandments because when the spirit of the Lord getting you Ezekiel said he will condition you to do the Commandments and you're doing the Commandment because that is what I like the blessing [Applause] [Music] let me continue jump to verse two amen and all this blessing shall do what come on thee and do what overtake thee do you not overtake do you know whatever take in other words you are running away from the blessing and the blessing are following you and afterwards the blessing will outrun you they will run more than you until the blessing catches you and say come back here we need you [Music] and the blessing swallow you up and you begin to swim around the blessing of God [Applause] can you say amen amen let's go to verse two and all this water blessing shall come on you and do what overtake this watch again if [Music] every promise is under condition if you shall do

always says I'm independent in that way don't put me under a bushel that brother Stephen you only have to preach this no God gave me the full message wherever I can fall in the message I will preach

no time for security my friend I don't need any scanning now amen glory to God brother Branham said in 20 years of water research of the water the Bible who did the research brother I'm good then I'm gonna head to the airport in 20 years of water research of the Bible and talking with the who Angel of the Lord in other words brother Branham is saying that I did my research and I talked to the author of the book 20 years what did you find he said and the many things I found here how many things two things that it is how love and water hey [Music] you understand the love of God is coming from the Holy Ghost now we need to get in safe everybody okay if you love God just how purely an adulterated love you get to have faith in him amen bring them back I let that soak him if you love God just purely an adulterated love you get to have faith in him he shall accompany Faith water every time and he went in love and faith get water Mary then you do after us what you want to and you know what you have it [Applause] yeah we talk about the Holy Ghost coming in your life fulfilling the requirement we talk about the Holy Ghost bringing the love of God now brother Branham is saying when you speak about love you cannot speak about love without faith everybody okay when love and faith get married then ask what you want cannot continue and you shall have it William Marion Branham listen to this John said we know and believe the love of God that has for us God is water and he that dwelleth how in love dwell if way in God and God where in him here is our love made how perfect that we may have how boldness in the day of water judgment because as he is so are we in this world in other words we are representing Jesus now amen [Applause] when you need Jesus today you need to see me [Applause] I don't know if you get me if you want to see Jesus come and talk to me so we would see Jesus you don't ask the Jews anymore you come and ask me because I am his representation now everybody good everybody good he there is no fear in water but perfect love do what cast it out fear so when the Holy Ghost come in your life and dispatch love that love is multi-purpose everybody okay number one he loves you with God number two it will help you fulfill the Commandment of God it'll help you walk with God keep with God do the will of God and number three love begin to look for fear he said what fear is in his life fear is there come out come out please over there come on is that the one perfect love is removing fee why is he removing fear because you need to start getting blessing amen [Music] father help me listen to this brother Branham think of it no water fear that is the greatest plague there is in the Christian church today it is water afraid and the reason they are afraid is because they are not taught right we call our teaching intellectual in this message because somebody doesn't know how to get in the Deep then we become intellectual we all bake a cake and we call everybody to eat our cake I didn't tell the people to leave your cake and to come and eat my cake so when the people come and eat my cake don't start jealousy ask me how do I bake my cake [Applause] amen we all preach the message I didn't tell people to subscribe in our Channel but it depends on the cake you breaking so don't start the jealousy we have to bake the cake because we are begging for Malachi fall but for some reason they are searching somebody else they don't search you you need to recalibrate your cake [Applause] everybody okay because they are not taught how right they say the right on the water gospel [Applause] and then it creates jealousy that God came if your brother is accepted go ask him yes You Preach something different in the message oh no that's intellectualism that's intellectualism because you don't know how to launch in the Deep [Music] intellectualism people continue to finish the cake [Applause] we have how great things that we can do in the realm of water Faith safe work great things for us and if you Brethren here get it you can't have faith until you have love so the love of God remove fear then when he removed fear he doesn't stop there he begin to produce faith Faith why because you must pull out what you have in you must come out brother Branham said you can have faith until you have water love that is just all there is to it perfect love the Water cast out all fear as long as you got fear you can't have what hey so you got to have water love first fear out fear out then Faith water comes in so when the Holy Ghost come dispatches love he removed here when fear is all about because fear create torment that's why you can't sleep that's why when the alarm sound in the morning you go boom because it's another day it's another problem that bill need to be paid the hospital bill over there that insurance guy was calling me he created all kinds of frustration the love of God come and remove all of that and because you got problem God have to generate faith so that you can get access to whatever you desire [Applause] [Music] he says so you get to have water first and then love will do it and then Faith water comes in and takes the place of what fear so the love of God we places fear with faith it takes fear out and he takes faith and put him in what are you doing with that if so when you have that you are coming how right along listen to this I'm gonna search the airport perfect fifth just like water perfect love all fear all water doubting if you believe it no matter what the symptoms are what the result you believe in just the water the same stop this believing is not you because you didn't have it to begin with but you will feel something in your heart rising up [Music] Lord help me he said just you believe it is just the water say do you ever have something you just knew was going to happen no matter what look like a man that happened but it's going to happen how anyhow because you believe it how that way have it happened to you you don't know how but you just feel like it will be okay and somehow it becomes okay it is God that is doing that [Music] and if you notice when you believe that it's okay you're not afraid you will see everybody say mama do you think it will be okay you say that's fine go to sleep you eat mama you sure don't worry you'll be okay maybe mom is doing that to make me feel good no and you see mommy sleeping snowing and woke up because that Faith keep your nerve quiet father help me so I can land this ship when you get pure water unadulterated Faith Like Your Love Is to your companion then you prove it by the way you act you ain't complaining no more you know it is done just walk what alone no matter what the things you look like what anybody else says you know what is happen you know that it is finish just as well as you know you love your husband as well as you know you love love and faith has to go together love love produce faith everybody okay let me lay the scripture and we go he says in Ephesians 6 peace be to the present and love with Faith from who God the Father everybody okay second scripture the grace of the of Our Lord of Lord was exceeding abundant with faith and water love which is in who Christ Jesus third scripture hold fast the form of sound word which that has heard of me in say and love which is how in Christ Jesus everybody okay Galatians 5 verse 6. in Jesus Christ neither circumcision eval if anything no uncircumcision by how Faith which worketh by water love everybody together how can you have faith in your wife if you don't love her [Applause] to God how can it be if you don't love God [Applause] whoa healing of the love and faith which that has to order the Lord Jesus first commandment and towards are there same second commandment almost my friend [Applause] brother Branham says this uh Paul says this but let us who are of the day be how sober putting on the breastfeed of the breastplate of what faith and water love get it now Leo said to me coming in this morning he said brother pranam which was first Faith produce love or love producer they I said law producer they not Faith love you have to love first before you can have faith faith and love for our resources faith and love is relation because you can't have faith unless you gather because your faith is in God Who is the very essence of water faith and love the Water Works together Lord help me up three everything in the Bible is the water three three blinds to our water a one father son Holy Ghost not true God but who one faith hope and Waters charity not three different things but all the essence of one water in other words love produce hope and Lord produce faith that's why God say love hope all things and believe with all things amen it's in the book of First Corinthians 13. I'm just skipping for time amen you get scared and that's the reason scared a scare fear accompanies water doubt love accompany water faith I love my father I'm not afraid of him because I love him he will not hurt me he will do good for me if I was scared of him oh I don't know whether he would do it or not see then you're in trouble what are you laying down my friend the great physician who is here who said this son shall follow them that believe if they lay their hand on the sick they shall recover and if you say to this matter be moved and don't doubt in your heart but can water believe you ready if he can create squirrels who has no way at all or nothing there to believe it is my own that goes and does that let me start it again who has no way at all or nothing there to believe it is my own way that goes and does that my faith in what he challenged me to ask so God can I ask you for something you cannot produce when God asks you for something just know you can do it everybody okay he said he challenged me to do water ask it and I receive his water challenge challenge in obedience to what his word us and it's a period God in heaven knows that is what true so we have been challenged that God wants us to prosper and to be in good health as I saw Prosper we need Now to respond in obedience to God's challenge and to begin to ask him according to his word [Applause] in other words God is challenging you and I'm not accepting his challenges [Applause] do you know that God challenged job amen because he knew what was in job amen God will not challenge you if you're not able to do it God knows the potential of the sea when God is challenging you that's why he led things to squeeze you because when you are pushed to the edge that you you will wake up [Applause] that's the mystery of desperation brother Branham said desperation is to bring the best of you out so God has to tighten things together until you say enough is enough [Applause] I'm gonna stop here there was a man called shanga every year and pick up his crops and go and God was sleeping and God was doing nothing God was just watching same God and some God is praying father don't you see the Philistine father don't you see the Philistine God is just watching him and watching him then he continued next year God said no if I do something this boy won't understand let them get it next year next year they take it Daddy at the ticket until one day the boy said no you know what he looked at his family he looked at his wife he said you know what either it's gonna change or we will continue like this but let me take a chance now it's gonna change it because he was pushed to the end and when he began to react to God said that was it amen how can one man kill 600 people [Applause] in other word when you put yourself in that sin God also stepping [Applause] everybody okay everybody okay because the Jew had a secret and the secretary circumcision and the secret was a secret the secret was a secret because circumcision is not to the public amen so when you fight the Jew he will be fighting with you but if he remember that done in him he has something different than you yes yo gave me something get him his office that's why when David come he said wait a minute since [Applause] Goliath was dressed for liar Dead Clothing but David saw behind his clothes he said he's a man I'm a man he star I'm short but there is one thing different I got the circumcision he doesn't have it amen [Applause] how can a stone destroy again amen because when Faith launched out when David took a stone and sent the stone God said that's all I was waiting God took the song and he forced it and got Goliath down the Holy Ghost is an action faith is a nutshell When Faith is there Faith does the rest quiet you need to act on what you believe in [Applause] no more you cannot continue the way you are going you need to push your break and say enough is enough amen look in your life what is not going right amen you got the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost didn't come there to be watching you suffer [Music] God when you get him into a circumstances he will change it you take him to a funeral he will say he he will bring life back wherever you take out he will change the circumstances so how can God be sitting 20 years and you are suffering and God is doing nothing amen amen and you pray and you pray until you discourage because you think your prayers are not answered amen take the Lord of faith that you have increase our faith no no no no no no no no no you don't need to increase our faith the Lord will be that you have if you say to this monkey if you say to this man [Applause] I tried so many times that's not the problem amen the love of God is in you it's telling you everything will be okay amen lunch unto the deeper and get into the deep amen and then push what you want to push that's all God is waiting for amen that's why you're going through desperation that's why things are cutting up because you're too lazy [Applause] let me stop here let's stand [Applause] brother Branham says here but Daniel had purpose in his heart to do the purpose of God and God has placed that in his heart before Daniel could have have this desire they had to be something to create that desire before he could have that Faith there had to be something to tell him that there was a God that could deliver so The Heroes of Faith that you see there they are not different than you they operated without the Holy Ghost in them amen and they shut the mouth of a lion amen I don't know where you were it the purpose of the Holy Ghost is not to come to serve you and stop there the Holy Ghost is coming to fulfill God's word to open the door for your blessing if something is not working you need to talk to the Holy Ghost you need to go awake Jesus Christ that is sleeping on your boat wake him up and say master we are perishing we can go on a third this is not a Titan no this one we don't think this is not a Titanic we don't think if he is in our boat we don't think that's the Titan and the Titanic in my marriage no implosion in my life I want bastard I won't go crazy I will never have depression I won't bust I won't go to the psychiatrist I will not go there amen I have been built for this and if I go I will come up [Music] amen let's pray Heavenly Father Lord once again we are
