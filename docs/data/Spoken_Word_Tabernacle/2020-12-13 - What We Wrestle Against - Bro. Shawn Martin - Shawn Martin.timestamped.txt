[32:59] bible you need the holy ghost
[33:02] because man of old spoke by the
[33:06] holy ghost amen and the same thing
[33:11] apply for the message of the hour
[33:15] amen brother brown i'm saying here this
[33:18] way brother branham stay here this way
[33:20] put them together and ask the holy ghost
[33:23] to
[33:24] lead you amen
[33:27] hallelujah no matter what you do
[33:30] there will be a pharaoh that will not
[33:33] recognize
[33:34] joseph even though he got his paycheck
[33:37] from joseph
[33:41] amen but still he's not going to
[33:43] recognize joseph
[33:45] amen despite everything you're going to
[33:48] give it to him
[33:49] he's not going to recognize joseph
[33:52] amen blessed be the name of the lord
[33:56] you know brother branham said that jesus
[33:59] christ
[34:00] spoke certain things purposely
[34:07] to make somebody else to live
[34:10] [Music]
[34:11] so i'm not going to be able to explain
[34:14] you the entire message
[34:16] because there are stuff that have been
[34:18] spoken in a message
[34:20] to help somebody leave the message
[34:26] amen it was meant for that purpose
[34:32] ii thessalonians chapter 2
[34:35] and with all deceivableness
[34:38] of our righteousness in them that perish
[34:43] because they receive not the love of the
[34:47] truth that they might be saved
[34:51] for this cause god shall send them
[34:55] strong delusion
[34:58] not just a delusion a strong one
[35:04] strong delusion that they should believe
[35:08] a lie you go back in the old testament
[35:13] you found out that to deceive ahab
[35:17] amen god used a lying spirit
[35:23] and that spirit was not going to the
[35:28] nightclub
[35:30] spirit was not going to the gamble place
[35:34] that spirit went on inside the prophet
[35:39] inside the preachers amen
[35:43] and the preacher begin to prophesy lies
[35:49] history repeat itself amen
[35:52] but there was one preacher
[35:55] by the name of makaiah amen
[35:59] the difference between makaya and the
[36:01] other preacher
[36:03] machias sermon was line up with elijah
[36:07] the prophet
[36:11] amen zedekiah got angry
[36:14] that's the anointing of a lying spirit
[36:18] it is an anointing with anger
[36:21] i am angry i am frustrated
[36:25] i am mad it is an anointing on zedekiah
[36:30] in an expression of a lying anointing
[36:34] amen do you know why did they hate him
[36:37] by zedekiah
[36:39] because mackay was unveiling the spirit
[36:43] that was on the false prophet he
[36:46] received the revelation
[36:48] of the lying spirit that was upon the
[36:51] other prophet
[36:53] church flee amen
[36:56] look for a mecca preacher that's going
[37:00] to preach you the bible
[37:02] in line with malachi 4
[37:07] amen look for a preacher that's going to
[37:10] preach you a message
[37:11] line up with elijah the prophet that's
[37:14] the preacher
[37:15] you need to follow that's the message
[37:18] church you need to be under
[37:21] amen we don't have another message we
[37:24] only have the message of the hour
[37:26] a sure word of prophecy and that word is
[37:30] a lamp in this

[44:03] walking with the lymph
[44:05] and we brought her home in a brace and
[44:08] so we
[44:09] just began to pray we wouldn't accept
[44:10] what the doctor said
[44:12] that was nice of what he was saying and
[44:14] and according to the natural scientific
[44:17] uh yeah it was true what he was saying
[44:19] but we believed in the word of the lord
[44:21] and
[44:22] and we began to pray and so we took her
[44:24] to a specialist
[44:26] uh that they had scheduled for us and
[44:28] and
[44:29] um to see if they could do the operation
[44:31] and all that and
[44:32] you know uh my i was out on the road

[44:43] it and
[44:44] he says i don't know something's wrong
[44:46] here so he he says i'll be right back so
[44:48] he brought in another doctor and
[44:50] and he uh working on her and testing her
[44:53] and we had the x-rays

[45:15] testimony after what god has done and
[45:18] they've come too late to tell me that
[45:20] god doesn't exist that god isn't real
[45:22] and
[45:23] amen the lord is just so wonderful and i
[45:26] know there's testimonies here this
[45:28] morning that we could all just
[45:29] testify all day long of what god has
[45:32] done and still can't
[45:33] tell at all amen the lord is so good
[45:36] amen
[45:36] praise the lord if you have your bibles
[45:38] we're going to turn to
[45:40] first peter and like to
[45:44] say is it's just a real honor to stand
[45:47] before you this morning
[45:49] and to uh preach the gospel and i
[45:52] i appreciate your pastor for extending
[45:56] the invitation to come and we've
[45:59] certainly been uh upholding uh you all
[46:02] in our prayer and uh just so grateful
[46:06] to see the lord just uh working among
[46:09] you
[46:10] and really enjoyed what your pastor had
[46:12] to say this morning and
[46:14] and uh tell you what we're living in a
[46:16] treacherous hour aren't we
[46:17] amen but you know the prophet already
[46:19] warned us of these things and
[46:21] so it's it's not anything that really uh
[46:24] surprises us uh uh or or sets us back
[46:29] we've already been warned and prophet
[46:31] said we're sailing through treacherous
[46:33] waters
[46:34] amen and um so so we just got to keep
[46:37] our head
[46:38] uh looking upward amen because we know
[46:41] the coming of the lord is very soon
[46:43] amen and i appreciate my family
[46:46] my wife and children some of my children
[46:49] here
[46:50] and uh we certainly love and appreciate
[46:53] them
[46:54] and but uh we want to turn to first
[46:58] peter the fifth
[46:58] chapter and um
[47:02] before we go in to the the reading of
[47:05] the word may we just bow our heads and
[47:09] talk to our lord for just a few moments
[47:11] here
[47:12] father lord we're so
[47:15] thankful for the opportunity to come and
[47:18] speak to your people
[47:21] lord it's it's just an honor and to be
[47:24] with your redeemed and lord
[47:27] these people you loved even more than
[47:30] yourself
[47:32] for you gave your own life you gave your
[47:34] own blood
[47:36] the prophet even made the statement a
[47:39] few times that if i had a little cup
[47:42] a charger the the the literal blood of
[47:45] our lord jesus
[47:47] just a couple drops how precious and how
[47:50] sacred that would be that
[47:52] we would hold it to where we couldn't
[47:54] wouldn't spill it and
[47:56] we'd treasure it but lord how much
[47:58] greater
[47:59] sins sitting before us is your blood and
[48:02] that's the redeemed
[48:04] father your blood shed for the people
[48:08] and oh god we're so glad to be a part of
[48:10] the redeemed of the lord
[48:12] and i pray father that you would come in
[48:15] a special way and anoint
[48:17] the gift that you placed within me god
[48:20] and help me to yield
[48:22] to you and may you anoint the seed
[48:25] that's in the people father that
[48:27] they could yield to you as well and any
[48:30] spirit that would try to hinder
[48:32] we ask that you'd drive that thing away
[48:35] this morning
[48:36] lord that we would have the freedom in
[48:38] you
[48:39] god we just ask it in your lovely name
[48:43] jesus christ and the church says
[48:47] man and a man but uh
[48:50] first peter 5 and we're going to
[48:55] start at maybe the the sixth verse
[48:59] and it says humble yourselves
[49:03] therefore under the mighty hand of god
[49:07] that he may exalt you in due time
[49:12] casting all your care upon him
[49:15] for he careth for you be sober
[49:20] be vigilant because your adversary the
[49:23] devil
[49:24] as a roaring lion walketh about seeking
[49:27] whom he may devour
[49:31] i want to just read part of that ninth
[49:33] whom
[49:34] resist steadfast
[49:37] in the faith resist
[49:41] steadfast in the faith
[49:44] amen you can have your seats this
[49:46] morning
[49:48] and may the lord just bless the reading
[49:52] the ministering of the word this morning
[49:54] and
[49:55] i i've been kind of on a series
[49:59] uh back home and and by the way our uh
[50:03] the church greets you in the name of the
[50:05] lord and
[50:06] and uh but the uh the series that i've
[50:09] been on
[50:10] is what we wrestle against and i'd like
[50:14] to
[50:14] maybe just take part of that this
[50:16] morning and
[50:18] speak to you and trust that it'll it'll
[50:21] be a blessing
[50:23] in some way but
[50:26] you know uh there i i think that
[50:29] sometimes
[50:30] uh people get the wrong idea
[50:34] of christianity and they
[50:37] they think that christianity is a
[50:40] carefree life
[50:42] a life without trouble a life without
[50:45] you know
[50:45] heartaches and and it seems to be the
[50:48] popular
[50:49] uh thought idea that is presented to the
[50:52] world
[50:54] uh but our our opening scripture there
[50:57] addresses believers they're not
[50:59] addressing anyone but
[51:00] but believers and and christians who are
[51:04] holy ghost-filled amen and the prophet
[51:08] said when you get the holy ghost you're
[51:10] just beginning
[51:11] your your troubles uh are just starting
[51:15] now now i'm not saying that christianity
[51:17] is bad
[51:18] but it's the best life you could ever
[51:20] live but at the same time
[51:23] we we do face troubles ain't that right
[51:26] and and christians have struggles amen
[51:30] as they sojourn in this life and it's
[51:33] it's not that we struggle to to live a
[51:36] christian life
[51:37] it's it's not that we struggle to love
[51:40] our lord how many loves the lord
[51:42] how many glad you're a christian so so
[51:45] the
[51:45] the struggle is is not there
[51:49] uh we we do not struggle to possess
[51:52] a desire to to serve him it's
[51:56] it's really not that we struggle to be
[51:59] sold out
[52:00] uh to him i i don't think that
[52:04] you would be here today uh uh if
[52:07] if you really didn't love the lord and
[52:10] actually
[52:11] you could not be a christian uh
[52:14] unless you are sold out to him lock
[52:16] stock and barrel
[52:18] in other words your whole being you
[52:20] you've got to be sold out or you really
[52:22] couldn't be a christian
[52:23] amen and and we we we couldn't we
[52:26] couldn't be filled with the holy ghost
[52:29] if if we weren't a believer amen for the
[52:32] prophet says when god
[52:34] recognizes that faith amen then he gives
[52:37] us the seal of the holy ghost that he
[52:40] has recognized
[52:42] our faith so it's not that you have to
[52:44] beg god for the holy ghost
[52:46] it's not that you have to you know plead
[52:48] and and
[52:49] and fast 50 days in order to get the
[52:51] holy ghost
[52:52] the holy ghost comes when god recognizes
[52:55] your faith
[52:56] so so how many's got the holy ghost amen
[52:59] so
[53:00] you got the holy ghost so that we're not
[53:02] struggling to believe this morning
[53:04] amen we we've got that anchor because
[53:07] god wouldn't have given you the holy
[53:09] ghost
[53:09] if he did not recognize the faith amen
[53:12] and the prophet says faith
[53:14] is something that's born in you it's
[53:16] something
[53:17] that god gives you amen so so we do not
[53:21] struggle
[53:21] to believe in god and we do not struggle
[53:24] amen with his word
[53:26] yet christians struggle christians
[53:30] wrestle ain't that right for that's what
[53:32] paul said we
[53:33] wrestle amen it's it's it's something
[53:36] there
[53:36] and and we all have an adversary and
[53:40] and it's it's the same adversary but yet
[53:43] it's a personal
[53:44] adversary for the the peter said in our
[53:47] opening scripture
[53:48] that it's your adversary he just didn't
[53:51] say
[53:51] the adversary or a adversary
[53:54] he said he's your adversary so it's a
[53:58] personal
[53:59] warfare it's a personal battle it's a
[54:02] personal
[54:02] enemy that is come after you and yet we
[54:06] all
[54:07] have the same enemy but see we're all
[54:10] made up of different
[54:11] personalities we're made up of different
[54:13] likes where
[54:14] we we're we've all made up differently
[54:17] and satan knows
[54:18] exactly what to hit you on he knows how
[54:21] to come at you
[54:22] he knows all about you he intimately
[54:25] knows who you are as an individual
[54:29] if you have complexes that's where the
[54:31] devil's going to come
[54:32] if if you have if you have uh
[54:35] issues in some ways a circumstances well
[54:38] that's where the devil's going to try to
[54:39] sneak in
[54:40] amen but in other he's your adversary
[54:44] can you say amen
[54:46] amen so so uh the warfare
[54:49] amen has never been so great
[54:52] as it has in this age here amen and the
[54:55] prophet
[54:56] uh spoken here christ is revealed
[54:59] in his own word he said now where i come
[55:02] to the conclusion to talk on this
[55:05] was because that knowing that what we
[55:08] say we mustn't just say because we're
[55:11] gathered together
[55:13] just to haphazardly speak on anything
[55:16] but it's something that will help
[55:18] stabilize
[55:20] the people for we are going
[55:23] he says we're going to pass through
[55:26] dangerous
[55:27] treacherous waters and we're already
[55:30] sailing through them now
[55:33] and sometimes i guess with like it is
[55:35] with me
[55:36] and and must be with you that is so much
[55:40] of it is so scary
[55:42] amen and and we can we can we can say
[55:44] that's true
[55:45] amen everything around us it just seems
[55:48] frightening and
[55:49] and even the bible says that men's
[55:51] hearts would fail them for fear
[55:53] who would have ever thought that we're
[55:55] fighting this virus and
[55:56] who would ever thought that were where
[55:59] the country is in the shape that it's in
[56:01] and the church is in the shape that it's
[56:04] in who would have ever
[56:05] thought that you all would be in the
[56:07] condition that you are
[56:09] now can you say amen amen but it's a
[56:12] treacherous hour hey
[56:13] we're sailing through dangerous waters
[56:16] now the prophet said that 55
[56:18] years ago amen and and also in the
[56:21] message the greatest battle
[56:23] ever fought in 62 he said i believe that
[56:26] the greatest battle that was ever
[56:28] thought is now ready to go in action
[56:31] i believe that god has been selecting
[56:33] his soldiers
[56:35] do you believe god selected you god
[56:38] has been selecting his soldiers amen and
[56:41] i believe he's been
[56:43] dressing them he's been training them
[56:46] and the battlefront is now set getting
[56:49] ready to start now he made that
[56:51] statement
[56:51] about 58 years ago amen and here we are
[56:55] as a selected soldier amen not knowing
[56:58] what to do
[57:00] no no no we know what to do because god
[57:02] has trained us
[57:04] through the message of the hour we know
[57:06] how to handle ourselves we know
[57:08] how to stay stable we know how to stay
[57:11] anchored
[57:12] amen the winds are going to blow the
[57:14] critics are going to come
[57:15] everything is coming against us and
[57:17] we're living in this dark hour
[57:19] and thank god we've been selected by god
[57:23] and trained by god amen to know how to
[57:26] amen to confront the battle amen at hand
[57:30] amen that's right now the prophet says
[57:33] this
[57:33] he said now people don't believe in
[57:35] demons this day can you imagine that
[57:37] amen but the thing to do to my opinion
[57:40] is
[57:41] know your enemy can you say amen
[57:45] know your enemy amen he says know your
[57:47] enemy
[57:48] and train for the contest that you're
[57:51] going to have
[57:52] when you meet him not if you meet him
[57:55] when you meet him he said because
[57:59] you're going to meet him
[58:02] can you say amen now it ain't just your
[58:05] pastor going to meet him
[58:06] you young people are going to meet him
[58:08] mamas and daddies are going to meet him
[58:10] uncles and aunts are going to meet him
[58:12] grandpa's are going to meet him
[58:14] can you say amen the preacher is going
[58:16] to meet him you're going to meet him
[58:19] and know him know what his strength is
[58:22] and then you train for this contest when
[58:25] you do meet him
[58:26] for it's one thing sure you're
[58:30] going to meet him so you train for this
[58:33] contest
[58:34] now he says now training for a contest
[58:36] is just like a boxer
[58:38] his enemy that he's going out to meet
[58:40] out there in a contest to fight a real
[58:42] good fighter
[58:43] usually knows and studies his opponent
[58:46] he studies his licks
[58:47] knows what he's fighting where he fights
[58:49] at see whether he leans forward he hangs
[58:52] back
[58:53] he fights right-handed left-handed he
[58:55] studies all of this
[58:56] and if he's a good smart fighter he gets
[58:59] him a sparring partner
[59:01] that'll fight just like his opponent
[59:03] fights for he knows
[59:06] all of his licks when he gets to that
[59:08] place can you say amen
[59:09] now i want to tell you about our enemy
[59:11] the devil wants to devour us
[59:14] ain't that right he wants to devour you
[59:16] amen
[59:17] that's right john 10 and 10 says the
[59:20] thief cometh not
[59:21] but for to steal to kill and to destroy
[59:25] can you say amen amen the christian life
[59:28] is is the greatest life
[59:30] but that doesn't mean you live this life
[59:32] at ease for he
[59:34] comes to kill steal and destroy
[59:38] can you say amen now you think of that
[59:40] because i've i've thought well why
[59:41] doesn't people just walk away from the
[59:43] messages just leave us alone
[59:45] amen because they're anointed of a
[59:46] spirit that wants to take you away
[59:49] that wants to take you out that wants to
[59:51] discourage you
[59:52] that wants to confuse you amen that
[59:55] wants to
[59:55] amen desire you can you say amen he
[59:58] wants to desire you young people
[1:00:00] amen he wants to desire the preacher he
[1:00:02] wants to desire
[1:00:04] every ounce of us and that word devire
[1:00:07] is to swallow you up to gulp you
[1:00:11] entirely can you say amen
[1:00:14] so understand that that the devil our
[1:00:17] adversary wants to bring us to a place
[1:00:20] to where there is nothing left of us
[1:00:24] to where we're just a has-been amen to
[1:00:27] wear
[1:00:27] everything is a memory i remember when
[1:00:31] i i remember when i was under that
[1:00:33] anointing i remember when
[1:00:35] i walked with god he it doesn't care of
[1:00:38] the fact that you still in church
[1:00:40] as long as you don't have an experience
[1:00:42] with god
[1:00:43] as long as you ain't got the joy you
[1:00:45] used to have as long as your faith
[1:00:48] isn't as strong as it used to be can you
[1:00:51] say man
[1:00:51] he wants to devour you and age is no
[1:00:55] concern of him
[1:00:56] amen gender is no concern to him
[1:00:59] family that you belong to is no concern
[1:01:03] to him
[1:01:04] then you think well then why doesn't he
[1:01:06] just leave
[1:01:07] me alone amen why doesn't he leave the
[1:01:10] church alone
[1:01:12] amen well ii thessalonians 2 4 speaking
[1:01:15] of that devil
[1:01:16] our adversary says he opposeth
[1:01:20] and exalteth himself above all that is
[1:01:23] called god
[1:01:24] or that is worshipped so that he as
[1:01:27] god sitteth in the temple of god
[1:01:30] showing himself that he is god can you
[1:01:33] say amen
[1:01:34] the warfare ain't out in the bar the
[1:01:36] warfare ain't out in the prostitutes
[1:01:39] the warfare is in the church can you say
[1:01:42] amen
[1:01:43] for he opposeth he opposeth god
[1:01:46] and he opposes anything that has to do
[1:01:49] with god
[1:01:50] he opposeth anything amen that has the
[1:01:53] name of god
[1:01:54] can you say amen amen he's opposing
[1:01:57] because he wants to exalt himself
[1:01:59] above god ain't that right and that word
[1:02:02] opposeth
[1:02:03] is means repugnant which means to
[1:02:06] stubbornly
[1:02:08] resist amen so you take a step
[1:02:11] he's going to stubbornly resist you
[1:02:14] every step you take
[1:02:15] he's going to resist you every growth
[1:02:17] you have
[1:02:18] he's going to resist you every
[1:02:20] triumphant battle you have
[1:02:22] he's there to resist you and he's going
[1:02:25] to resist you in every way
[1:02:27] possible he wants to get you sidetracked
[1:02:30] off the promise of god can you say amen
[1:02:34] that's right now notice ephesians 6 11
[1:02:38] put on the whole armor of god that you
[1:02:40] may be able to stand against the
[1:02:42] wiles or trickery of the devil
[1:02:46] now the prophet said he's a slickster so
[1:02:49] you better watch him
[1:02:50] he's the greatest deceiver man has ever
[1:02:53] had
[1:02:54] and and the deception is in the most the
[1:02:56] greatest deception is in this age
[1:02:59] he deceived eve and look what it done to
[1:03:01] the world but that was in its
[1:03:03] infant stage to what the deception is
[1:03:05] today
[1:03:06] so you've got to be able to put on the
[1:03:08] whole armor of god
[1:03:10] that you can stand against this
[1:03:11] deception that you can stand against his
[1:03:14] trickery
[1:03:15] amen of the devil for he is our
[1:03:17] adversary right
[1:03:19] for we wrestle not against flesh and
[1:03:22] blood
[1:03:23] it's not the individual that we're
[1:03:24] wrestling against amen it's not mama
[1:03:27] that we're wrestling against he's not
[1:03:28] the preacher
[1:03:29] that we're wrestling against it's it's
[1:03:31] not the people around us our friends
[1:03:33] amen see it's it's it's a devil that
[1:03:36] we're wrestling against
[1:03:42] do you believe that now notice he says
[1:03:45] see
[1:03:45] we wrestle not against flesh and blood
[1:03:48] but against principalities
[1:03:50] against powers against the rulers of the
[1:03:53] darkness of this world
[1:03:54] against spiritual wickedness in high
[1:03:57] places
[1:03:58] now you just bear with me as we go on
[1:04:00] now amen because i find this interesting
[1:04:03] that paul puts this in the book of
[1:04:05] ephesians
[1:04:07] amen it's written in the book of
[1:04:08] ephesians and what does ephesians
[1:04:10] mean to us when you study amen the the
[1:04:14] paradox you study the messages
[1:04:16] uh adoption you study their messages and
[1:04:19] the prophet says the book of ephesians
[1:04:22] parallels the book of joshua
[1:04:26] can you say amen amen see so what what
[1:04:29] uh
[1:04:30] and the book of joshua deals with the
[1:04:32] dividing up
[1:04:34] and setting in order the overcome ones
[1:04:37] and the book of joshua is a book of
[1:04:39] redemption
[1:04:40] but it deals with the second part of
[1:04:43] redemption
[1:04:44] now exodus is a book of redemption but
[1:04:47] it's dealing with the
[1:04:48] first part of redemption see those two
[1:04:50] parts of redemption
[1:04:51] there's coming out and there's going
[1:04:53] into can you say amen
[1:04:55] you see god didn't just call you out or
[1:04:58] something
[1:04:59] there's a position for you to come into
[1:05:02] there's a land
[1:05:04] that is ordained for you there's a place
[1:05:07] that he's called you to come to
[1:05:09] can you say amen that that's right so
[1:05:13] there's two parts of that redemption
[1:05:14] coming out of
[1:05:15] and going into and the book of joshua
[1:05:18] is dealing with the people of god coming
[1:05:22] into their
[1:05:23] inheritance ain't that right amen so i'm
[1:05:26] glad for the book of ephesians
[1:05:28] amen because it's dealing with our
[1:05:30] inheritance that paul
[1:05:32] in that ephesians is telling us you
[1:05:34] better watch it
[1:05:35] because you're not wrestling against
[1:05:37] flesh and blood there's going to be a
[1:05:39] warfare
[1:05:40] when you come into your inheritance
[1:05:42] there's going to be a warfare
[1:05:44] and it's in positions amen that is high
[1:05:47] it's a power it's a dominion it's a it's
[1:05:50] an authority
[1:05:51] that you're wrestling against
[1:05:57] so it's dealing with the people of god
[1:06:00] coming
[1:06:01] into their inheritance in joshua by
[1:06:03] inspiration
[1:06:04] divided the land and allotted it to each
[1:06:07] man
[1:06:08] placing the people where they belong
[1:06:12] hallelujah and notice this book of
[1:06:15] ephesians
[1:06:17] is to a certain group of people those
[1:06:20] who
[1:06:20] are in christ jesus the ones who are
[1:06:24] setting
[1:06:24] in heavenly places that's the position
[1:06:28] of the believer those who god foreknew
[1:06:32] he called and then he called he
[1:06:35] predestinated
[1:06:36] and then he predestinated he already
[1:06:39] glorified
[1:06:42] he ain't that right so these are the
[1:06:45] ones
[1:06:46] amen that are wrestling against the
[1:06:48] principalities
[1:06:49] powers and strongholds so indeed
[1:06:53] ephesians deals with us
[1:06:56] entering in to our position
[1:07:00] and our inheritance now you have to
[1:07:02] remember it was not moses
[1:07:04] that took the people over moses was law
[1:07:08] moses was condemnation ain't that right
[1:07:12] moses could not bring the people into
[1:07:14] their promise
[1:07:15] it took a joshua to bring them over and
[1:07:18] joshua is the one that had the message
[1:07:20] of grace
[1:07:21] amen joshua was one that
[1:07:24] that dealt with predestination
[1:07:28] the law can only put you in amen the
[1:07:31] pawn shop
[1:07:32] he can only put you in jail but it
[1:07:34] couldn't bring you out
[1:07:36] but here come a message of grace that
[1:07:38] said hold it hold it hold it
[1:07:40] i know they're in jail but i see them
[1:07:43] before the foundation of the world
[1:07:45] and i know they have a place they have a
[1:07:48] land
[1:07:49] that rightfully belongs to them
[1:07:53] hello amen
[1:07:57] so moses represented the law which was
[1:07:59] the church age
[1:08:01] amen dispensation amen joshua
[1:08:05] represented the dispensation of grace
[1:08:08] now as long as the people were in the
[1:08:10] wilderness they didn't have to fight
[1:08:12] because they did not own the land amen
[1:08:15] they didn't fight their battles
[1:08:17] amen because the land wasn't theirs
[1:08:20] ain't that right they walked through the
[1:08:22] land of esau
[1:08:23] that god said hold your peace this isn't
[1:08:26] your inheritance
[1:08:27] this belongs to esau you just keep on
[1:08:30] walking
[1:08:31] ain't that right they walked through the
[1:08:33] land of mohab
[1:08:34] man but god says hold your peace this
[1:08:37] isn't your land
[1:08:38] i've given you another land this is
[1:08:40] moab's portion amen i've got another
[1:08:42] place for you
[1:08:43] can you say amen amen see god didn't
[1:08:46] give them
[1:08:47] i let that land to possess and i want to
[1:08:49] say this there's things that god did not
[1:08:51] give you
[1:08:52] a man to possess that others are
[1:08:55] possessing
[1:08:58] can you say amen others are coming into
[1:09:00] their land
[1:09:01] and you might look and say well they're
[1:09:03] getting blessed look at them but don't
[1:09:05] you look at them
[1:09:06] don't you fuss with him don't you fight
[1:09:08] with him you've got another portion
[1:09:11] [Music]
[1:09:13] are you with me the land of canaan
[1:09:16] didn't belong to them that belonged to
[1:09:17] thee it belonged to you
[1:09:19] the land of the promised land did not
[1:09:21] belong to moab
[1:09:22] it did not belong to esau it belonged to
[1:09:24] the elect of god
[1:09:29] praise the lord now the land the
[1:09:33] promised land was across the river
[1:09:36] ain't that right and it was legally
[1:09:39] their inheritance amen and i believe
[1:09:42] this is where we are today
[1:09:44] i believe that brother branham's
[1:09:46] ministry is the ministry of joshua
[1:09:51] now i know i know brother brown said
[1:09:53] joshua is jesus
[1:09:57] but you can't separate jesus from this
[1:09:59] message
[1:10:01] jesus christ is the message can you say
[1:10:04] amen
[1:10:05] jesus christ is the message of grace
[1:10:08] jesus christ is the very one that
[1:10:10] anointed this prophet
[1:10:11] amen to call out the elect of god god
[1:10:14] knew his own
[1:10:15] can you say amen brother branham didn't
[1:10:17] know who the elect of god was
[1:10:19] god knew who the elect of god was
[1:10:26] that's right amen and i believe brother
[1:10:30] branham's ministry
[1:10:32] is a type of the joshua ministry amen
[1:10:35] for the sole purpose
[1:10:36] of carrying us over into the land of
[1:10:39] promise
[1:10:40] and positioning us i want to tell you
[1:10:42] there was the first pool
[1:10:44] that was great there was the second pool
[1:10:46] that was good
[1:10:47] but there's a third pool that is our
[1:10:50] land
[1:10:54] [Music]
[1:10:55] now brother branham said the third pool
[1:10:57] is the opening of the word
[1:10:59] in other words this book is open to the
[1:11:02] elect
[1:11:07] we're understanding our place we're
[1:11:09] understanding our inheritance
[1:11:11] we're understanding where we come from
[1:11:13] we're understanding where we're going
[1:11:15] we understand there's a new heaven
[1:11:17] there's a new earth there's a millennium
[1:11:19] there's a body change that is coming
[1:11:22] it's in our land
[1:11:26] well it's true
[1:11:29] see the open book is our land of promise
[1:11:37] we're talking of adoption now can you
[1:11:39] say amen
[1:11:41] amen that's right now it's in this age
[1:11:45] that we are now claiming coming to claim
[1:11:48] our land
[1:11:50] that is ours by inheritance
[1:11:53] god gave it to us are you with me
[1:11:57] see we're not just looking at this as
[1:11:58] bible stories anymore
[1:12:00] we're not looking at these things as
[1:12:03] just a history book
[1:12:05] and say well i'm glad god done what he
[1:12:07] done for daniel i'm glad for what god
[1:12:09] done for the hebrew boys
[1:12:10] now we're looking at it as our
[1:12:12] inheritance
[1:12:16] basically we were looking at and said
[1:12:17] mama it's me
[1:12:22] this is me
[1:12:26] that's right now notice
[1:12:29] but this land it it's a it's a
[1:12:32] it's a territory that satan has
[1:12:35] dominated
[1:12:37] and inhabited for so long even though it
[1:12:40] doesn't belong to him
[1:12:42] amen you realize before the book was
[1:12:45] open
[1:12:46] men had probed and tried and they tried
[1:12:49] to understand the book
[1:12:51] and there's many people still trying to
[1:12:53] understand the book
[1:12:56] because it's not open unto them it's
[1:12:58] opening to the elect
[1:13:00] ain't that right so satan is a poacher
[1:13:03] he's
[1:13:04] he's a squatter now notice again what
[1:13:06] you're wrestling against
[1:13:08] you're wrestling against principalities
[1:13:10] which is
[1:13:11] governments you're wrestling against
[1:13:14] powers
[1:13:15] the prophet said spiritual powers
[1:13:17] against the rulers of this darkness
[1:13:20] which is the devil he controls he
[1:13:23] controls the
[1:13:23] world he controls the democracy he he
[1:13:26] controls politics he controls culture
[1:13:29] he controls education he controls
[1:13:31] science he controls religion
[1:13:36] and against spiritual wickedness in high
[1:13:38] places the prophet said
[1:13:40] big places great places
[1:13:44] see so so we're not wrestling some
[1:13:46] little peel
[1:13:50] we we're we're not coming against some
[1:13:52] little weakling
[1:13:54] because that's not your position
[1:13:58] i hope you understand see he's ruling in
[1:14:01] the position that belonged to you
[1:14:06] you were made to rule not the devil
[1:14:10] you were made god over this earth not
[1:14:12] the devil
[1:14:14] you were made to control the winds not
[1:14:15] the devil
[1:14:17] you were made control to control things
[1:14:19] not the devil
[1:14:22] can you say amen see but satan
[1:14:26] dominates with power and authority
[1:14:30] he's controlled the world and dominates
[1:14:32] in the political realm
[1:14:33] dominates he controls the nature he's
[1:14:36] the one that causes typhoons he's the
[1:14:38] one that
[1:14:38] because it's a perversion of control of
[1:14:41] authority
[1:14:42] amen you were made to settle it down
[1:14:44] just like the prophet said when eve was
[1:14:46] walking through the garden and they were
[1:14:48] walking through the garden she said oh
[1:14:49] honey it's
[1:14:50] it's cool the wind's cold and he says oh
[1:14:53] he says don't worry he win be still
[1:14:57] but satan takes that wind and he creates
[1:15:00] typhoons
[1:15:01] he creates hurricanes ain't that right
[1:15:05] he he calls his blizzards he's the one
[1:15:07] that does these things
[1:15:09] and and and that's why there'll be
[1:15:11] nothing like that in the new earth
[1:15:13] amen see he's the one that's dominating
[1:15:15] and
[1:15:16] and and and we look even when jesus was
[1:15:19] going across the
[1:15:20] the the sea of galilee i believe it was
[1:15:23] and uh to help that man of gatteri
[1:15:25] amen in the middle of the sea the wind
[1:15:28] began to pick up and the waves began to
[1:15:30] amend to roar and and and it almost sunk
[1:15:33] the ship
[1:15:34] and the prophet said see satan got into
[1:15:36] that
[1:15:37] and was trying to destroy jesus
[1:15:40] trying to drown the ship can you say
[1:15:42] amen that's right see
[1:15:44] amen see so we're not wrestling against
[1:15:47] flesh and blood
[1:15:48] and we're not wrestling against someone
[1:15:51] that is just so weak and helpless and
[1:15:54] and all these things if you notice in
[1:15:56] the book of isaiah
[1:15:58] the 14th chapter the bible says that
[1:16:01] satan
[1:16:02] has determined and said within himself
[1:16:05] that he would exalt his throne
[1:16:08] above the stars of god now the prophet
[1:16:11] said that's the sons of god
[1:16:15] bear with me now satan has set in his
[1:16:18] heart
[1:16:19] amen to set his throne and establish his
[1:16:22] authority
[1:16:23] over the sons of god
[1:16:29] i i can't help but believe that he wants
[1:16:32] to dominate
[1:16:34] over the children of god
[1:16:38] you believe that
[1:16:41] that's why you've got to be sober
[1:16:46] vigilant
[1:16:48] because he's seeking to establish his
[1:16:51] kingship
[1:16:52] over you and for years he has done that
[1:16:57] he has indoctrinated us
[1:17:01] he has plagued us he has made us his
[1:17:04] slaves
[1:17:07] if he said dance we'd say how high or
[1:17:09] how long
[1:17:11] whatever he said we were at his bidding
[1:17:15] how many has ever dealt with habits in
[1:17:16] your life
[1:17:19] what is it it's a control
[1:17:26] ain't that right now your adversary
[1:17:30] he wants to dominate our soul
[1:17:34] our spirit our mind
[1:17:39] he wants to dominate our body
[1:17:44] you with me he wants to dictate you
[1:17:47] in every way possible
[1:17:52] think that right now you don't break
[1:17:54] from his power just because you go to
[1:17:56] church
[1:17:58] i i'm reminded of pharaoh amen when
[1:18:02] moses come with the message of
[1:18:03] deliverance
[1:18:05] and he said let my people go pharaoh
[1:18:08] said all right i'll let you go
[1:18:09] you can go out in the wilderness for
[1:18:10] three days but you got to leave
[1:18:12] something behind
[1:18:13] you got to come back now that's the way
[1:18:16] a lot of folks in the church are
[1:18:20] they've gone so far but satan still has
[1:18:23] a control on their life
[1:18:25] but you see moses come with the message
[1:18:28] of total deliverance
[1:18:34] [Applause]
[1:18:36] joshua came with the message of total
[1:18:40] deliverance
[1:18:44] that's why the doubters could not enter
[1:18:46] into the promised land
[1:18:48] because they were looking at the giants
[1:18:50] and saying they're too big for us
[1:18:52] god didn't want that attitude coming
[1:18:53] into the promised land
[1:18:57] you you you cannot come into this
[1:19:00] message and wholly believe the message
[1:19:01] with unbelief
[1:19:05] let's just preach you you you can't
[1:19:08] come and have this message totally
[1:19:11] affect your life
[1:19:13] when you still doubting
[1:19:16] i believe that this message of the hour
[1:19:19] is calling for a total
[1:19:21] deliverance a total separation
[1:19:25] from unbelief
[1:19:28] i don't care what devil you're facing i
[1:19:31] don't care what your trial is
[1:19:32] i'm telling you god has called for
[1:19:36] a total deliverance a total triumph
[1:19:42] can you say amen now see so
[1:19:45] you you you've got to understand that
[1:19:48] god sent a prophet
[1:19:50] with the message of deliverance ain't
[1:19:52] that right
[1:19:53] that's right amen now we we look
[1:19:57] moses or pharaoh amen it
[1:20:00] was going to have to relinquish
[1:20:03] every bit of his power over
[1:20:06] the children of god when moses come with
[1:20:10] the message
[1:20:12] it wasn't a bargain with pharaoh
[1:20:17] it was a command let my people
[1:20:20] go any control you have over their mind
[1:20:24] let them go any control you have over
[1:20:27] their soul
[1:20:28] let them go any control you have over
[1:20:30] their thoughts
[1:20:31] let them go any control you have over
[1:20:34] their body
[1:20:35] let it go ain't that right
[1:20:39] you see it's more than just coming into
[1:20:41] church see god
[1:20:42] has called us to come into our land
[1:20:47] that has been predestinated for us
[1:20:53] i hope this all right it's more than
[1:20:56] just coming to church
[1:20:59] it's more than just having holiness
[1:21:00] standards
[1:21:02] we believe in holiness don't we i hope
[1:21:04] you do
[1:21:05] but it's more than that amen people have
[1:21:08] you know
[1:21:09] we we get some that believe in holiness
[1:21:11] so much that they make it a legalist
[1:21:13] message that's not deliverance
[1:21:16] that actually binds the people this is a
[1:21:19] message of grace
[1:21:21] and we believe in holiness
[1:21:24] but if holiness was our land then we
[1:21:27] would have stayed with wesley
[1:21:32] under the message of sanctification i'm
[1:21:34] glad for the restoration of the gifts of
[1:21:36] pentecost
[1:21:37] but that's not my land if that was my
[1:21:40] land i would stay there
[1:21:44] now they're trying to get us go back to
[1:21:46] that spot that's not my land
[1:21:51] well are you with me
[1:21:52] [Applause]
[1:21:55] if our land was just the restoration
[1:21:58] god wouldn't have sent a prophet but god
[1:22:01] sent a prophet with a joshua ministry
[1:22:05] to open the land
[1:22:12] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:22:15] hallelujah you see satan's been able to
[1:22:18] not
[1:22:19] to dominate he dominated him that in the
[1:22:22] wesleyan h
[1:22:23] he dominated in the lutheran age you say
[1:22:26] well i don't know about that then why
[1:22:27] did they go back to denominations
[1:22:31] he was able to dominate they weren't
[1:22:34] able to break all the way free
[1:22:35] amen from satan's onslaught he dominated
[1:22:39] in that pentecostal church
[1:22:40] look at the pentecostal church today
[1:22:43] they've lost their holiness
[1:22:44] they've lost all convictions they
[1:22:47] they're stealing the titles
[1:22:49] they've lost their power their young
[1:22:52] people ain't getting the holy ghost
[1:22:56] they've gone to man-made programs
[1:23:01] so it did not break them from satan's
[1:23:05] dominion because that wasn't the land of
[1:23:08] promise
[1:23:09] but here comes a joshua ministry
[1:23:13] not just to lead us around another age
[1:23:16] he said there's no more ages to come
[1:23:20] can you say amen this is the time for
[1:23:23] the people
[1:23:24] to cross over never
[1:23:27] to be dominated by sin again
[1:23:33] never to go back wandering in the
[1:23:35] wilderness again
[1:23:40] this is our land of promise
[1:23:44] young people i hope you understand this
[1:23:46] is our land of promise
[1:23:49] you realize that now you can take the
[1:23:51] book you see i was in the pentecostal
[1:23:54] age
[1:23:55] raised under the pentecostal message
[1:23:57] there was so much confusion about this
[1:23:59] book yes we had the bible
[1:24:01] but there was so much confusion because
[1:24:03] we didn't know what scriptures belonged
[1:24:05] to us
[1:24:06] we didn't know what it was talking about
[1:24:08] we knew that god loved us but we didn't
[1:24:10] know this was a love story
[1:24:13] satan beat us all the time if we didn't
[1:24:15] feel having some emotion
[1:24:17] we felt lost if we weren't kicking our
[1:24:20] heels we felt lost
[1:24:21] we felt condemned we didn't understand
[1:24:24] that god's love for us is forever
[1:24:26] it's permanent whether i feel him or
[1:24:28] whether i don't feel him whether i feel
[1:24:30] victory or whether i don't feel victory
[1:24:32] whether i feel god's love for me or
[1:24:34] whether i don't feel god's love
[1:24:35] he loves me
[1:24:39] i didn't know the scriptures oh we
[1:24:43] quoted the scriptures
[1:24:44] but i couldn't apply them to me
[1:24:51] but then here comes the opening of the
[1:24:52] word
[1:24:54] now i'm able to look at every page
[1:24:59] and see myself in the book
[1:25:02] i can take healing from my i don't have
[1:25:04] to take the doctor's words
[1:25:06] the doctor said you're going to die no
[1:25:07] i'm not
[1:25:09] i've got an open book now i can
[1:25:12] personally claim my
[1:25:13] inheritance do you realize there's a
[1:25:17] people on this earth that's never going
[1:25:19] to die
[1:25:20] they're ready for a rapture
[1:25:24] [Applause]
[1:25:25] it's an open book satan has broke his
[1:25:28] power
[1:25:32] if god will break the power of your soul
[1:25:34] why can't he break the power of your
[1:25:36] body
[1:25:37] if god can break the power over your
[1:25:40] very soul
[1:25:42] to where satan cannot possess you any
[1:25:44] longer
[1:25:45] why can't he break the power over your
[1:25:48] mind
[1:25:51] i know we're living in a world of
[1:25:52] insanity but that don't have to be you
[1:25:56] i know we're living in a world of
[1:25:58] darkness but you're the children of the
[1:25:59] light
[1:26:00] darkness can never affect you
[1:26:03] well praise the name of the lord it's an
[1:26:06] open book
[1:26:07] [Music]
[1:26:09] now notice
[1:26:12] satan's power came by way of sin
[1:26:16] and what is sin what is it
[1:26:21] satan's power come by way of
[1:26:24] unbelief
[1:26:28] unbelief do you realize he still finds
[1:26:30] his power that way
[1:26:33] he still finds his power through the
[1:26:34] unbeliever the moment you doubt the book
[1:26:38] the moment you doubt the promises satan
[1:26:40] gains his power over your life
[1:26:43] well are you with me the moment you
[1:26:45] start believing that victory ain't yours
[1:26:47] what just might as well just know
[1:26:49] victory ain't yours
[1:26:50] but if you believe that victory is yours
[1:26:53] if you believe you're going to come out
[1:26:56] you're going to come out it's just the
[1:26:59] truth
[1:27:00] now notice he finds his power so he is
[1:27:03] in
[1:27:03] the position to rule and to dominate but
[1:27:06] that position
[1:27:08] is rightfully yours as long as adam was
[1:27:11] in that position
[1:27:12] then satan could not dominate he
[1:27:15] couldn't express
[1:27:16] the power that he had ain't that right
[1:27:20] but he when he got man to fall then he
[1:27:23] came to power
[1:27:24] and dominion see satan does not want to
[1:27:27] give it up
[1:27:30] he does not want to yield that authority
[1:27:32] over to you
[1:27:34] are you with me now i'm thinking of this
[1:27:37] past election
[1:27:44] we ain't gonna get in politics so don't
[1:27:46] throw your tomatoes
[1:27:50] but here we've got the struggle for
[1:27:51] power we got one
[1:27:54] saying it's rightfully mine
[1:27:58] we've got the other and saying no it's
[1:27:59] not
[1:28:01] i belong in the white house and it's a
[1:28:04] struggle for
[1:28:05] position ain't that right
[1:28:08] now it's going to go to the courts and
[1:28:10] the courts are going to decide
[1:28:12] what is what ain't that right but you
[1:28:15] see
[1:28:16] it's just like us we're coming to power
[1:28:28] but our power isn't some some republican
[1:28:31] or democrat power
[1:28:33] our power is not belonging into england
[1:28:36] so we're not trying to dethrone the king
[1:28:38] or the queen or whoever we're not trying
[1:28:40] to amen get putin
[1:28:42] out of his place because that's not our
[1:28:44] power our power is
[1:28:46] where the devil's at our power
[1:28:49] is there and we're saying hold it that
[1:28:51] is rightfully mine
[1:28:53] i fell from that position
[1:28:57] i'm made to rule over the devil not the
[1:28:59] devil rule over me
[1:29:01] and he is trying to say no no no no i've
[1:29:04] been in this position for thousands of
[1:29:06] years
[1:29:07] how dare you try to come into my and
[1:29:09] take me over
[1:29:10] but see our our it ain't going to the
[1:29:13] courts of america
[1:29:15] god has already said it
[1:29:20] it's already been final
[1:29:23] god has laid claim and said hold it
[1:29:26] this is the relaxed position
[1:29:33] the devil has nothing to do but to
[1:29:35] relinquish his power
[1:29:41] it's your right it's your inheritance
[1:29:44] because god himself gave it to you oh
[1:29:47] i hope you get it it's i'm so glad
[1:29:52] that when i get i can tell my children i
[1:29:54] could tell my wife hold it
[1:29:55] you know you're the victor you're the
[1:29:58] victor
[1:29:59] but i'm not giving it because i'm their
[1:30:00] daddy i can say hold it god said you're
[1:30:03] the victor
[1:30:04] god said you're the overcomer god said
[1:30:06] you can rule over this thing
[1:30:08] teenagers i know you're going through
[1:30:10] some battles but god said you're the
[1:30:11] ruler over it
[1:30:13] you don't have to go out in that world
[1:30:14] you don't have to hey man go out and be
[1:30:16] a drug addict and a smoke act victim
[1:30:18] and get caught up in your marriage and
[1:30:20] messed up you can look at the devil
[1:30:22] and say devil i've had enough of you
[1:30:27] parents can look and say devil let go of
[1:30:29] my daughter
[1:30:30] let go of my son let go of my family
[1:30:33] it's not yours any longer
[1:30:37] we are coming back to authority
[1:30:41] of what rightfully belongs to me
[1:30:56] you believe you got power even over the
[1:30:57] devil in this church
[1:31:00] yes you do but people come united
[1:31:03] together
[1:31:04] and such at one the devil ain't got no
[1:31:06] strength in the church
[1:31:09] when the people get behind their pastor
[1:31:11] pray for the pastor and the pastor
[1:31:13] amen staying prayed up and loving the
[1:31:15] people and stand with this message of
[1:31:16] the hour
[1:31:17] satan ain't got a chance in a
[1:31:18] congregation
[1:31:22] why we are a people that's called to
[1:31:25] rule
[1:31:26] we are a people of the land of
[1:31:28] inheritance
[1:31:32] you love him now we're coming in to take
[1:31:35] our position
[1:31:37] satan's been in this power this position
[1:31:40] for many years and notice notice how it
[1:31:42] keeps it
[1:31:44] he is the accuser of the brethren
[1:31:47] everybody say he is the accuser of the
[1:31:50] brethren
[1:31:51] who puts them thoughts of condemnation
[1:31:53] in you the devil does
[1:31:55] who keeps throwing his past to your past
[1:31:57] that you the devil does
[1:31:59] who keeps reminding you of your past the
[1:32:01] devil does he's an accuser
[1:32:06] and what happens we begin to believe it
[1:32:09] i've been there i've been wearing just
[1:32:11] praising god at work
[1:32:13] and then just the thoughts of my past
[1:32:15] and before you know it
[1:32:17] my hands start getting down i start
[1:32:19] silencing my song
[1:32:21] and before you know it i start
[1:32:22] meditating and before you know it i
[1:32:24] start all over again lord
[1:32:26] please forgive me oh jesus if you just
[1:32:27] forgive me oh god help me
[1:32:29] i'm so sorry that well that ain't a life
[1:32:31] of faith you see i've already confessed
[1:32:33] it under the blood
[1:32:34] i don't need to put it back under the
[1:32:36] blood it's the devil that keeps
[1:32:38] reminding me
[1:32:39] can you say amen that now i can see
[1:32:41] myself in the book
[1:32:42] and i see that he's a loser i i he
[1:32:45] reminds me of my past i remind him of
[1:32:47] his future
[1:32:50] and i remind him of who i am i'm not a
[1:32:53] fallen downtrodden sinner
[1:32:55] i am a son of god and i'll never be a
[1:32:58] sinner
[1:32:58] in the sight of god again
[1:33:08] you realize that
[1:33:12] once you're ever filled with the holy
[1:33:13] ghost you're sealed to the day of your
[1:33:15] redemption
[1:33:16] god will never look at you as a sinner
[1:33:18] again
[1:33:19] now let's just let's just preach for a
[1:33:21] moment let's just talk
[1:33:24] god will never look at you as a sinner
[1:33:25] again quit looking at yourself as a
[1:33:27] sinner
[1:33:28] see we're coming to a land of
[1:33:30] inheritance
[1:33:32] and while satan is reminding us of egypt
[1:33:35] we're already out
[1:33:36] of egypt we're not part of that world we
[1:33:38] found out we're not part of that world
[1:33:40] are you with me so i understand the
[1:33:42] bible says that men's hearts are failing
[1:33:44] them for fear
[1:33:45] that that does not apply to me i'm not
[1:33:47] of that part that's not my portion of
[1:33:49] land
[1:33:50] my land is of faith my land is of
[1:33:52] authority my land is a
[1:33:54] is a position that i cast out the devil
[1:33:59] [Music]
[1:34:01] do you believe you have that authority
[1:34:02] to cast out devils
[1:34:05] well apparently you don't i said do you
[1:34:07] believe
[1:34:08] that you yourself is in the authority
[1:34:10] and position
[1:34:11] to cast out devils it isn't just a
[1:34:15] preacher
[1:34:16] it can be your what you moms it could be
[1:34:18] you young people
[1:34:27] can i say it this way you can still cast
[1:34:28] out devils even in your
[1:34:30] deepest trials because your trials
[1:34:33] doesn't affect you as sonship
[1:34:35] you're a son and daughter of god
[1:34:37] regardless you could be in the bottom of
[1:34:39] hell and not feel the presence of god
[1:34:41] and steal that dominion
[1:34:42] and authority still lives in you to
[1:34:44] where you can say satan get your hands
[1:34:45] off my
[1:34:47] get your hands off me get your hands off
[1:34:49] my family
[1:34:50] get your hands off my church get your
[1:34:52] hands off of anything
[1:34:53] that belongs to me it's an authority as
[1:34:57] a
[1:34:57] son whether you feel like it or not
[1:35:01] we don't go by emotion we go by what's
[1:35:04] in the book
[1:35:14] i hope this is all right
[1:35:15] [Music]
[1:35:18] caleb 80 year old that means 80. anyone
[1:35:22] got
[1:35:22] any 180 maybe not good
[1:35:26] i've got some 80 year old saints in my
[1:35:28] church
[1:35:29] now they're little feeble
[1:35:34] you know they're walking in you're
[1:35:36] thinking bless their little hearts
[1:35:40] but caleb had 80. says give me my
[1:35:43] mountain
[1:35:44] now i i'm going to tell you something as
[1:35:46] an 80 year old he did not feel like a 20
[1:35:48] year old
[1:35:50] i guarantee he had symptoms as an 80
[1:35:52] year old would
[1:35:53] but see he was not looking to his
[1:35:55] symptoms he was not looking how he felt
[1:35:58] he was not looking at his feebleness
[1:35:59] he was not looking how weak he was he
[1:36:01] was looking at the promise of god
[1:36:03] and church is time to start looking at
[1:36:05] the promise of god
[1:36:07] i don't care how dark it is look through
[1:36:08] the promise i don't care how impossible
[1:36:11] it seems
[1:36:11] look to the promise i don't care how
[1:36:13] ugly it is look to the promise
[1:36:16] it's dark but look to the promise i'm
[1:36:18] feeble
[1:36:19] i can't make it another day look to the
[1:36:22] promise
[1:36:25] [Applause]
[1:36:29] look to the promise and you say amen
[1:36:34] now satan is the accuser of the brethren
[1:36:37] so he's trying to make his case that we
[1:36:38] are unworthy
[1:36:40] of this position he makes the case that
[1:36:43] we are unfit
[1:36:44] and we're misfits he makes us a case
[1:36:48] amen as to why we are not worthy
[1:36:51] he makes this case as to why we should
[1:36:54] remain discouraged
[1:36:55] he makes his case as to why we should
[1:36:58] remain
[1:36:58] powerless and defeated and hopeless
[1:37:02] amen he makes this case as to why we
[1:37:04] should be mentally deranged
[1:37:07] when it comes to the promises of god
[1:37:11] but listen the only way he could keep
[1:37:14] the position
[1:37:15] is if redemption price had not been met
[1:37:25] i know this is simple but i'm trying to
[1:37:27] make it simple for you
[1:37:31] i want to just explain what a redemption
[1:37:33] is
[1:37:36] i had a dog it was a corgi you all know
[1:37:40] where corgi is
[1:37:41] little oh long body
[1:37:47] somehow it got bred with a labrador
[1:37:54] and it had pups and they were so cute we
[1:37:58] just gave them away
[1:38:00] we didn't tell people we didn't even
[1:38:01] know what they were
[1:38:03] bread too we just knew she had pups
[1:38:07] we have a little old town and we gave
[1:38:09] him one to the store owner
[1:38:11] of a grocery store and he really liked
[1:38:13] that pup
[1:38:14] but one day he came to me said what kind
[1:38:16] of pup did you give me what kind of dog
[1:38:18] cause i don't know what part of it's
[1:38:19] corgi i said why he said well the thing
[1:38:21] can't even bark
[1:38:24] now i i drove by his house one day and
[1:38:28] his
[1:38:28] his grass was a little high and i see
[1:38:31] this long body
[1:38:33] just like a golden or a lab
[1:38:37] long tail and short legs
[1:38:42] he's moving around in the grass you
[1:38:43] can't even see his legs look like he was
[1:38:44] just floating
[1:38:47] i thought oh my goodness i hope i never
[1:38:48] see him again
[1:38:52] people made fun of my corgi but i liked
[1:38:53] her
[1:38:55] but she would get out a lot when we go
[1:38:57] to the store like i said we lived in a
[1:38:58] small town about 2 000 people but
[1:39:02] she would literally run to the store and
[1:39:05] when we'd come out there she was
[1:39:07] and and so everybody knew that you know
[1:39:10] this dog but
[1:39:11] anyway she showed up missing one day
[1:39:13] called her ginger ginger showed up
[1:39:15] missing you know and showed up
[1:39:16] missing and uh disappeared
[1:39:21] we we uh didn't see the dog for a while
[1:39:24] a few days and
[1:39:26] so we got to wondering where's ginger so
[1:39:28] i called the dog pound
[1:39:30] and they said y'all we got we got gender
[1:39:34] i said all right so i told my wife i
[1:39:36] said honey i'm gonna go
[1:39:38] i'm gonna go there and get ginger now at
[1:39:40] that moment
[1:39:41] i become redeemer
[1:39:45] why because see redemption
[1:39:48] means to bring back
[1:39:52] back so my wife
[1:39:56] my wife could be uh she could be happy
[1:39:59] and at rest
[1:40:00] because i didn't say i was gonna go shop
[1:40:03] i said i'm gonna go get ginger i'm gonna
[1:40:06] redeem
[1:40:08] so i wasn't gonna come back with a
[1:40:10] doverman pincher or a pit bull
[1:40:13] i wasn't gonna come back with any other
[1:40:15] dog but ginger
[1:40:17] so i walk into this deal and there's big
[1:40:19] old dogs i mean now that's a man's dogs
[1:40:22] you know
[1:40:23] not little old ginger man dog man
[1:40:26] they're growling
[1:40:28] but ginger see if she understood where i
[1:40:30] was coming from
[1:40:32] she could be at rest too maybe she felt
[1:40:35] intimidated
[1:40:36] by these big dogs and said oh my oh my
[1:40:39] if he ever sees these other dogs he'll
[1:40:40] forget about me oh my
[1:40:42] they're so much bigger they're so much
[1:40:44] more talented they're so much more
[1:40:45] beautiful
[1:40:46] and muscular and handsome and all that
[1:40:48] they're so much more attractive but see
[1:40:50] if she could understand my position
[1:40:52] and my mind i didn't come to shop for
[1:40:54] other dogs i come to
[1:40:55] redeem
[1:41:02] so the other dogs get out bar currents
[1:41:04] the other dogs could outgrowl her
[1:41:06] the other dogs get out and smart her or
[1:41:08] whatever but ginger was safe
[1:41:10] because i come to redeem now i thought
[1:41:13] of that because see when
[1:41:15] jesus come he didn't come to shop
[1:41:19] he didn't come to this earth to shop
[1:41:21] around he come to
[1:41:23] redeem
[1:41:27] now i look at another thing i bought my
[1:41:31] wife some
[1:41:32] some dishes a while back and and
[1:41:35] we we we have young people over and my
[1:41:38] boys and their boys
[1:41:39] these other boys got to wrestling in the
[1:41:41] kitchen and they broke
[1:41:44] a glass of that i bought just bought my
[1:41:47] wife that day i believe
[1:41:48] but it broke and it just shattered all
[1:41:51] them pieces
[1:41:52] now i said no don't worry honey
[1:41:56] i'm going to go get you another glass
[1:41:58] don't worry i'm going to replace
[1:42:00] that but see that's not redeeming
[1:42:03] that's replacing
[1:42:08] i could not redeem that because it was
[1:42:11] shattered
[1:42:13] i had not the power to bring it back
[1:42:19] i had to go shop not
[1:42:22] shop for just for something new i i went
[1:42:24] to shop to replace
[1:42:26] but see he didn't come to replace
[1:42:30] he come to redeem and no matter how bad
[1:42:33] you're broken
[1:42:34] and no matter how bad you're shattered
[1:42:36] god is able
[1:42:38] to put all the pieces back together and
[1:42:40] that's why i'm here today
[1:42:42] i ain't got a good life story my past
[1:42:44] ain't the greatest
[1:42:45] but i can tell you this the redeemer
[1:42:47] came one day and began to work on my
[1:42:49] life
[1:42:50] and what seemed to be impossible i
[1:42:52] thought i had no future
[1:42:54] but he gave me a future and he said
[1:42:56] every promise in the book
[1:42:57] is yours you've got it it's yours to
[1:43:00] claim
[1:43:02] do i feel worthy no he made me worthy
[1:43:06] [Applause]
[1:43:08] he redeemed me i was
[1:43:12] in his mind from the beginning
[1:43:24] now the old accuser says oh but
[1:43:29] but you see you've done this and you've
[1:43:32] done that and you've
[1:43:34] you're
[1:43:37] but he redeemed me can you say amen
[1:43:41] so now if you'll just bear with me for a
[1:43:44] few more moments
[1:43:45] if the price of redemption was not paid
[1:43:48] we could not
[1:43:49] entirely absolutely claim our
[1:43:52] inheritance
[1:43:53] but i believe with all my heart that the
[1:43:56] the price of redemption has been paid
[1:43:59] it's been paid not only for your soul
[1:44:01] but for your body
[1:44:03] your mind your spirit your entire
[1:44:06] being oh are you with me
[1:44:09] now notice brother brown says all jesus
[1:44:11] works was complete
[1:44:12] everything was complete totally
[1:44:14] delivered he totally delivered the leper
[1:44:16] from leprosy
[1:44:17] he totally delivered the woman with the
[1:44:19] issue of blood from her
[1:44:21] issue he totally delivered the world
[1:44:23] from sin when he died that that day
[1:44:25] at of the atonement he totally delivered
[1:44:28] every sin
[1:44:29] he delivered the church so there's no
[1:44:32] need
[1:44:33] this is joshua ministry there is no need
[1:44:36] for us to live underprivileged people
[1:44:41] there is no need for us
[1:44:44] to live in a defeated state because he
[1:44:48] defeated the devil
[1:44:49] he took all the principalities and
[1:44:51] powers and subdued them
[1:44:53] under his feet and they have no legal
[1:44:56] rights
[1:44:56] over you
[1:45:01] does this help you they have no
[1:45:04] legal rights to rule over you anymore
[1:45:10] we are christians filled with the holy
[1:45:13] ghost
[1:45:14] we don't have to have the devil to
[1:45:15] dictate us
[1:45:18] christ delivered us total deliverance
[1:45:21] he delivered us from evil delivered us
[1:45:23] from sin
[1:45:24] delivered us from habits delivered us
[1:45:26] from talking
[1:45:27] delivered us from black guard delivered
[1:45:30] us from all kinds of smutty things
[1:45:32] he totally delivered us and put us
[1:45:35] into his holy hands a complete total
[1:45:39] deliverance what's he looking to
[1:45:42] he's looking at calvary and seeing a
[1:45:45] total
[1:45:46] complete deliverance can you say amen
[1:45:48] amen now he says the title deed
[1:45:50] to the earth and to eternal life adam
[1:45:53] forfeited for wisdom
[1:45:55] instead of faith and the book that the
[1:45:58] title deed went back to its original
[1:46:01] owner
[1:46:01] which is god so satan couldn't get his
[1:46:04] filthy hands
[1:46:06] on it he could not legally
[1:46:09] claim it ain't that right now in the
[1:46:12] book of revelations the fifth chapter
[1:46:14] we see god sitting amen on the throne
[1:46:17] with the title deed in his hands
[1:46:21] waiting for redemption claims think of
[1:46:25] it
[1:46:25] waiting god waiting he's been under
[1:46:28] expectation
[1:46:29] now we've all it in some way or another
[1:46:31] been under expectation
[1:46:33] maybe of a vacation or maybe of a baby
[1:46:35] coming or
[1:46:36] marriage or whatever but we've been
[1:46:37] excited being under expectation
[1:46:40] notice god was under expectation and for
[1:46:43] the sons of god to come back to their
[1:46:46] position
[1:46:47] this is the day that god has been
[1:46:51] waiting on
[1:46:54] do you believe that and i don't believe
[1:46:56] that there's a people on this earth
[1:46:57] that's going to disappoint him
[1:46:59] god ain't going to be disappointed
[1:47:00] because you have been selected
[1:47:02] for this age to come back to your
[1:47:05] position of authority
[1:47:08] [Music]
[1:47:12] are you with me
[1:47:16] you ain't going to make excuses
[1:47:20] now i know the devil's throwing things
[1:47:22] that are dark at you
[1:47:26] but see there's a way for you to come
[1:47:28] back to position and that's where you're
[1:47:30] going to
[1:47:32] now notice god provided being jehovah
[1:47:35] jireh he provided himself
[1:47:37] a lamb by being the lamb himself
[1:47:40] revelations 5
[1:47:41] 1 and i saw in the right hand of him
[1:47:43] that said on the throne a book written
[1:47:45] within and on the backside
[1:47:47] sealed with seven seals and i saw a
[1:47:50] strong angel proclaiming with a loud
[1:47:52] voice
[1:47:52] who is worthy to open the book and to
[1:47:55] loose the seals thereof
[1:47:57] no man in heaven nor in earth neither
[1:47:59] under the earth
[1:48:00] was able to open the book neither to
[1:48:02] look there on and i went much because no
[1:48:04] man was found worthy
[1:48:06] to open and to read the book neither to
[1:48:08] look there on
[1:48:09] ain't that right so he's weeping he's
[1:48:11] sad he's
[1:48:13] because the opening of the word meant
[1:48:16] much it well brother branham says i
[1:48:19] think he went because if no one was
[1:48:21] worthy could open this book of
[1:48:22] redemption
[1:48:23] all creation was lost ain't that right
[1:48:25] which meant that satan would maintain
[1:48:27] his position
[1:48:28] would maintain his control amen and we
[1:48:31] would all
[1:48:32] amen be have one destiny and that was
[1:48:34] hell we would all
[1:48:36] remain under the bondage of satan we
[1:48:39] would all
[1:48:40] would not stand a chance amen to even
[1:48:43] come against him
[1:48:44] amen at all can you say amen amen if the
[1:48:47] book
[1:48:48] the abstract title deed wasn't open
[1:48:51] then man would forevermore be under the
[1:48:54] control
[1:48:55] and dominion of satan because uh he
[1:48:58] would uh uh
[1:49:00] a man would never be able to lay claim
[1:49:02] to what he fell from
[1:49:04] can you say amen that's right amen we
[1:49:07] would go to church but church wouldn't
[1:49:08] mean nothing
[1:49:09] we would talk about uh calvary that
[1:49:11] calvary wouldn't mean nothing we'd talk
[1:49:13] about heaven but heaven wouldn't mean
[1:49:15] nothing
[1:49:15] because we could not lay claim to them
[1:49:17] promises
[1:49:18] except the book be open
[1:49:22] i hope you understand because you cannot
[1:49:25] lay claim to anything
[1:49:26] except by faith i know
[1:49:30] you know we could we could we could take
[1:49:31] series of these things
[1:49:33] but you can't you can't like you can't
[1:49:35] claim your healing except by faith
[1:49:37] you can't claim a new body except by
[1:49:39] faith you can't claim victory except by
[1:49:42] faith well see god doesn't want you just
[1:49:44] wondering
[1:49:45] well i know he's saved i understand he
[1:49:47] died but does it for me
[1:49:50] i know he heals but is it for me i know
[1:49:52] there's a rapture but is it for me
[1:49:54] you know you can't go that way you got
[1:49:57] to know
[1:49:58] that healing is for you you've got to
[1:49:59] know these things
[1:50:03] so if the book wasn't opened then we
[1:50:05] could not have faith
[1:50:07] now notice but the prophet said here's
[1:50:09] the book here's the title deed it'll be
[1:50:10] offered to the kinsmen redeemer
[1:50:12] that can meet the qualification that's
[1:50:14] god's own
[1:50:15] law and he cannot defy his law
[1:50:19] see god required a kinsman redeemer who
[1:50:21] was worthy
[1:50:22] who was able to do it who had the
[1:50:24] substance to do it
[1:50:25] and the angel said now let that kinsmen
[1:50:28] redeemer
[1:50:28] step forward john looked he looked all
[1:50:32] over the earth
[1:50:32] he looked beneath the earth and there
[1:50:34] was nobody their
[1:50:36] creation was lost everything of course
[1:50:38] john wept
[1:50:39] but his crying didn't last but just a
[1:50:41] minute though
[1:50:42] for the fifth verse says and one of the
[1:50:44] elders saith unto me
[1:50:46] weep not ain't that right this ain't the
[1:50:48] time to weep
[1:50:50] this isn't the time to mourn this isn't
[1:50:52] time to be discouraged
[1:50:54] can you say amen behold the lion of the
[1:50:57] tribe of judah
[1:50:58] the root of david have prevailed to open
[1:51:01] the book and to loose
[1:51:02] the seven seals thereof now what is john
[1:51:06] seeing
[1:51:06] he is seeing a resurrected christ
[1:51:11] ain't that right and he knew that jesus
[1:51:14] was alive
[1:51:15] because he had seen him come and do a
[1:51:18] work
[1:51:20] now notice the bible or the prophet the
[1:51:23] well the bible says john is caught up on
[1:51:25] the
[1:51:26] lord's day do you believe he's in this
[1:51:29] day
[1:51:30] he was in this day looking at what was
[1:51:33] transpiring
[1:51:36] can you say amen now jesus christ has
[1:51:40] been sealed up
[1:51:42] for almost 2 000 years with
[1:51:43] denominational tombs
[1:51:47] are you with me the prophet said the
[1:51:49] holy spirit has been bound by these
[1:51:51] denominational rivers
[1:51:52] for almost 2 000 years but is to be
[1:51:55] loosed in the evening time by the
[1:51:58] evening time message
[1:52:02] the holy spirit back in the church again
[1:52:05] christ himself revealed in human flesh
[1:52:09] in the evening time
[1:52:13] now we know why to open the book
[1:52:16] and to give you your inheritance
[1:52:27] hello give you your inheritance
[1:52:31] we didn't see that in the pentecostal
[1:52:32] age
[1:52:34] but in this age we've seen a resurrected
[1:52:36] christ
[1:52:40] come forth and open the book
[1:52:45] that's right see notice
[1:52:49] he saw the lamb and he come and took the
[1:52:51] book out of the right hymn that set up
[1:52:52] on the throne
[1:52:54] ain't that right now this theme of the
[1:52:56] message of this hour is
[1:52:58] that jesus christ the same yesterday
[1:53:00] today and forever
[1:53:02] it's a resurrected christ living among
[1:53:04] us again
[1:53:05] he was dead but he's alive forevermore
[1:53:09] brother brown said what a resurrection
[1:53:11] that was speaking of 2000 years ago
[1:53:13] and what a resurrection this is
[1:53:16] why it's jesus christ in the bride
[1:53:22] [Music]
[1:53:24] amen this is one of the things that john
[1:53:28] or jesus revealed to john i was dead
[1:53:32] and am alive forevermore ain't that
[1:53:35] right
[1:53:36] and it's one of the things that god
[1:53:37] would show to the church
[1:53:39] and he has showed it in this age that he
[1:53:41] is resurrected
[1:53:43] from the denominational ages he is
[1:53:45] worthy
[1:53:46] to open the book we see him alive
[1:53:50] we see him real we see him as triumphant
[1:53:54] we see him as the mighty conqueror
[1:53:57] because he's opened the book
[1:54:02] and you say amen that's right
[1:54:05] it's proved to us that redemption price
[1:54:08] was paid
[1:54:09] now that that means something to us
[1:54:12] because people are saying that jesus
[1:54:14] is just a man critics are saying as well
[1:54:17] that it's just a figment of our
[1:54:18] imagination
[1:54:19] but in this day it's become more real to
[1:54:21] us than any other age
[1:54:23] amen because we understand if he hadn't
[1:54:26] been alive
[1:54:27] if he hadn't done the work of calvary if
[1:54:29] he hasn't wasn't worthy
[1:54:31] we would be lost forever but now we're
[1:54:34] finding our position
[1:54:36] not as mortal beings but as sons and
[1:54:39] daughters of
[1:54:40] god coming back to reign over sin
[1:54:45] over trial over sickness over anything
[1:54:48] can you say amen now notice
[1:54:50] revelations 10 1 i saw another mighty
[1:54:52] angel come down from heaven
[1:54:54] clothed with a cloud and a rainbow upon
[1:54:56] his head his face as it were the sun
[1:54:58] and his feet as pillars of fire and he
[1:55:00] had in his hand a little open book
[1:55:02] and he set his right foot upon the sea
[1:55:05] his left foot on the earth and he cried
[1:55:07] with a loud voice
[1:55:08] as when a lion roars and when he had
[1:55:11] cried
[1:55:12] the seven thunders uttered their voices
[1:55:16] ain't that right brother brown said the
[1:55:18] first thing that represented that
[1:55:19] redemption come the lamb
[1:55:21] that had been slain from the foundation
[1:55:23] of the world he
[1:55:24] took the book opened the book tore off
[1:55:26] the seals
[1:55:27] sent it down to the earth to his seventh
[1:55:29] angel to reveal it to
[1:55:31] his people why
[1:55:34] so you could come to your
[1:55:37] inheritance do you believe that
[1:55:47] bless his holy name when the book was
[1:55:50] open
[1:55:51] john the bible says he saw his himself
[1:55:54] in the book
[1:55:55] if i could find the quote right fast
[1:55:58] i'll i'll get ready to
[1:55:59] let you go amen but the prophet said
[1:56:02] john
[1:56:03] saw himself but i want to look at this
[1:56:06] because uh uh brother brown said now
[1:56:09] the lamb he sends the book to the
[1:56:12] seventh angel
[1:56:13] to reveal it to his people so what is
[1:56:16] revealed
[1:56:18] the abstract everybody say the abstract
[1:56:21] title deed that's what's been revealed
[1:56:26] brethren said what does abstract mean it
[1:56:28] means it searched
[1:56:29] all the way back to its beginning
[1:56:33] now notice he's reading from an abstract
[1:56:36] title deed an open book
[1:56:39] and notice what he says you never
[1:56:42] did it in the first place
[1:56:47] [Applause]
[1:56:50] it's a message of grace you never
[1:56:54] did it in the first place you are
[1:56:57] justified everybody say justified
[1:57:02] see so by the open book he gave us the
[1:57:05] true meaning
[1:57:06] of what justification really means
[1:57:10] you are justified in that you've never
[1:57:13] done it in the first place
[1:57:18] not forgiven remember the prophet said
[1:57:20] now you could go out and drink
[1:57:22] and you'd say i'm sorry and we'd say
[1:57:23] well we forgive you but see
[1:57:25] you couldn't be justified because you've
[1:57:26] done it but if i heard you went and
[1:57:28] drunk
[1:57:30] and i come up to you and says look
[1:57:31] brother i i forgive you for drinking you
[1:57:33] shouldn't have done that and you say
[1:57:34] well forgive me for what i've never done
[1:57:35] it
[1:57:36] ain't that right and the proof is there
[1:57:39] you've never done it
[1:57:40] so i could never forgive you because
[1:57:41] you're justified
[1:57:43] justification goes beyond forgiveness
[1:57:47] can you say amen so this redemption is
[1:57:50] not just god forgiven you
[1:57:52] this redemption is looking at the devil
[1:57:54] and saying no sin is being applied to
[1:57:56] him
[1:57:58] he's justified see because in the
[1:58:01] beginning
[1:58:01] you never had sin you never was a sinner
[1:58:05] in god's mind
[1:58:08] you never were scarred in god's mind you
[1:58:11] had never
[1:58:11] fell in god's mind so his redemption is
[1:58:14] to bring you back
[1:58:16] to what you was in his thoughts
[1:58:20] you never did it and began with
[1:58:23] that's the way he saw you i know i come
[1:58:26] as a sinner
[1:58:28] i know i was born in this world a sinner
[1:58:32] now you think of that i was born
[1:58:35] as a sinner all of us were
[1:58:40] how how how do you change it
[1:58:45] but he did
[1:58:49] i got scars to prove of what i've done
[1:58:51] wrong
[1:58:54] if we all stood here we'd scare each
[1:58:57] other
[1:58:58] of what our past was how do you change
[1:59:02] it but he did
[1:59:07] he so changed it that god never looks at
[1:59:10] you as a sinner
[1:59:16] your relationship with him is not god
[1:59:19] and sinner
[1:59:20] it's god and son god and redeemed
[1:59:26] that i can literally think of it now god
[1:59:29] can't
[1:59:30] forget the only thing that makes him
[1:59:33] forget is his blood
[1:59:36] [Music]
[1:59:40] his blood makes him forget so much
[1:59:44] so that when you or the devil tries to
[1:59:47] bring up
[1:59:47] your sins
[1:59:50] god looks this but what sins
[1:59:52] [Music]
[1:59:56] what sins are you talking about i don't
[1:59:59] know them
[2:00:00] are you with me you couldn't have
[2:00:02] fellowship
[2:00:03] under condemnation of sin so god takes
[2:00:06] the sins away
[2:00:07] you've never done it in the beginning
[2:00:12] [Applause]
[2:00:14] we're reading from an open book because
[2:00:17] the book is expressing god's thoughts
[2:00:24] that's why i took a lamb a lamb had to
[2:00:27] open the book
[2:00:28] a preacher couldn't open the book
[2:00:32] because he couldn't make you sinless a
[2:00:35] theologian couldn't open the book
[2:00:37] but when the lamb himself presented
[2:00:40] himself
[2:00:41] as a bloody bleeding lamb a kinsman
[2:00:44] redeemer
[2:00:45] he could open the book and god's mind
[2:00:48] was unfolded
[2:00:51] and he saw you innocent he
[2:00:54] saw you victorious and the devil is
[2:00:58] nowhere to be found
[2:00:59] in your book
[2:01:08] i hope it helps you
[2:01:13] who's missing did you read the book of
[2:01:16] revelation who's missing
[2:01:18] the devil when the lamb opens the book
[2:01:21] the devil ain't nowhere to be found
[2:01:26] he's lost he's lost his hold
[2:01:29] he's everything he he was the accuser of
[2:01:32] the brethren
[2:01:33] but he's no longer in that in that book
[2:01:35] he's no longer in the vision in the
[2:01:36] picture anymore
[2:01:41] now the book has been opened and sent
[2:01:43] down to a prophet
[2:01:45] now the book has opened and been read
[2:01:47] the prophet's reading from an open book
[2:01:49] looking in the open book
[2:01:51] and he said you're justified you've
[2:01:53] never done it in the first place
[2:01:54] you are the sinless virtuous bride of
[2:01:57] jesus christ
[2:01:58] in so much that you are miss jesus
[2:02:02] christ
[2:02:03] no wonder the devil is opposing you
[2:02:11] now if you can know who you are
[2:02:15] the prophet said if the bride could
[2:02:17] discern the two spirits within the
[2:02:19] framework of the church
[2:02:22] and know who she is she would be
[2:02:26] a what invincible army
[2:02:32] can you say amen so i want to tell you
[2:02:35] you're not defeated this morning
[2:02:37] you're not some downtrodden coincidence
[2:02:39] here this morning
[2:02:40] god selected jew for the age
[2:02:44] for his battle this battle but he gave
[2:02:47] you the weapon and that's an open book
[2:02:50] anytime satan says all you little peon
[2:02:52] say oh no no you don't understand i'm
[2:02:54] redeemed i'm a son of god
[2:02:57] i have every legal right
[2:03:00] young people you have every legal right
[2:03:03] hey man
[2:03:03] thinking of my son my daughter in law
[2:03:05] had had a headache the other day just
[2:03:07] really hurting they're driving home
[2:03:08] and she says honey would you pray for
[2:03:10] him in my head uh pray for me and
[2:03:12] my son just laid her his hand on her as
[2:03:14] their drive and say a father in the name
[2:03:16] of jesus christ i rebuked this
[2:03:18] headache in the name of jesus and that
[2:03:19] headache disappeared
[2:03:21] what is it it's an open book it's a
[2:03:24] people
[2:03:24] coming to claim their redemptive rights
[2:03:31] now the prophet said satan's a bluff
[2:03:34] if he can bluff you he said his only
[2:03:37] power
[2:03:38] is when he can bluff you into it he said
[2:03:41] if he can bluff you into taking your
[2:03:42] sickness
[2:03:43] then so be it you're sick but you don't
[2:03:46] have to be sick
[2:03:48] you don't have to be you you don't have
[2:03:50] to be defeated
[2:03:51] if you're sitting here this morning
[2:03:52] defeated it's because you're allowing
[2:03:54] the devil to defeat you
[2:03:56] i'm telling you it's an open book you
[2:03:58] want victory you can have victory
[2:04:00] you start walking start claiming your
[2:04:02] promise
[2:04:04] you want your family start claiming them
[2:04:07] you start walking the land it's your
[2:04:09] land
[2:04:10] [Applause]
[2:04:12] well praise the lord we're not a people
[2:04:16] whose hearts are filled with fear
[2:04:20] that's the world we are a people of an
[2:04:24] open book
[2:04:25] that's walking rock in our land who are
[2:04:27] you devil
[2:04:30] you think of it in zechariah
[2:04:33] when the bible talks about that
[2:04:36] headstone coming down
[2:04:38] jesus christ the headstone coming down
[2:04:40] on the body
[2:04:41] what was said what was declared who
[2:04:45] art thou o mountain
[2:04:50] which stands before zerubbabel
[2:04:53] thou shalt be made a plague
[2:05:00] so i declare to you mountain of sickness
[2:05:03] you gotta go
[2:05:05] this is the h you're going to be made a
[2:05:08] plane
[2:05:09] mountain of discouragement you got to go
[2:05:12] well start claiming your mountain church
[2:05:15] is there a caleb here
[2:05:16] that says give me my mountain because
[2:05:20] you can have it
[2:05:21] this is the age for it this is the age
[2:05:24] where the mountain doesn't stand before
[2:05:25] you and you just
[2:05:26] i just don't know no it's the age you
[2:05:30] stand as a son and daughter of god with
[2:05:31] that authority and say hold it i know
[2:05:34] what is rightfully mine
[2:05:36] he did not just die for my soul he died
[2:05:38] for my body
[2:05:39] he just didn't die for my body but i've
[2:05:41] got a claim to my family
[2:05:43] now there's promises there now that you
[2:05:46] can literally claim your family
[2:05:52] did not the prophet say you can do that
[2:05:54] you don't see your children go to hell

[2:05:58] understand it's a bad mess i don't care

[2:06:08] got an authority

[2:06:11] the enemy and that's the word of god
[2:06:13] and it's not a closed book it's not a
[2:06:15] sealed book
[2:06:16] it's an open book that tells you what

[2:08:50] oh my soul
[2:08:53] our worship is whole
[2:08:57] as they just play softly i thought of
[2:09:00] that you know john
[2:09:01] brother brown said john saw himself and
[2:09:04] he said there's john
[2:09:07] i used to think that it was just maybe
[2:09:09] he saw his name on one page
[2:09:12] and he says oh yeah my name's in the
[2:09:13] book but i can't help
[2:09:16] i was just thinking about it a while
[2:09:18] back
[2:09:19] i can't help but think that maybe as
[2:09:23] every page was turned
[2:09:25] to the promises john began to see his
[2:09:28] name on every page
[2:09:31] i'm the lord god that healeth thee ah
[2:09:33] there's john
[2:09:36] behold i'll sin unto you elijah the
[2:09:38] prophet ah there's me
[2:09:40] that's me he was wounded for our
[2:09:43] transgressions and i could just see john
[2:09:45] seeing his name on there
[2:09:48] every promise john began to claim
[2:09:51] and see his name see every redemptive
[2:09:54] right
[2:09:55] belongs to the children of god and today
[2:10:00] you might say well i'm so glad that i'm
[2:10:02] saved i am just so glad
[2:10:05] but what about the other promises
[2:10:08] won't you take that same faith and use
[2:10:10] it and apply it for your healing
[2:10:13] won't you take that same faith and apply
[2:10:15] it to your family
[2:10:16] won't you take the same faith and apply
[2:10:18] it to any aspect in your life
[2:10:21] because the blood of jesus christ covers
[2:10:23] all sin
[2:10:24] it covers everything whether it's for
[2:10:27] your affliction whether
[2:10:28] i i just stand here by the grace of god
[2:10:31] and i i tell you i know i've seen the
[2:10:33] blind open i've seen the
[2:10:35] the blind eyes open i've seen the

[2:10:59] to pray and god brought life into this
[2:11:01] body
[2:11:02] i'm so glad for his resurrection power
[2:11:05] his resurrection life
