[0:00] i think was yesterday today so she's
[0:02] doing
[0:03] way much you know a whole lot better and
[0:05] um so just keep her up in prayer
[0:08] i believe that god can be them lungs you
[0:11] know amen
[0:18] amen anyone else has testimony
[0:23] brother freddie god bless your sins
[0:31] i want to give this testimony a thing
[0:34] usually i don't give testimony but i
[0:36] know god is doing a love in my life
[0:39] so today i went to the doctor
[0:41] appointment
[0:42] i was diagnosed with high blood pressure
[0:45] so most of time my pressure is like 160
[0:48] by 100 so i don't know why but
[0:52] since last time brother polly can give
[0:54] his testimony what the lord has done for
[0:56] to his life with his blood pressure
[0:58] issue i told him that hey
[1:00] just pray for me i have the same issue
[1:03] the doctor wants me to keep taking a
[1:04] medicine
[1:05] but i don't like to take it because
[1:07] every time when you take this kind of
[1:09] medicine you have to
[1:10] the sad effect you have to take a
[1:13] different medicine
[1:14] so there was keeping adding medicine so
[1:18] last time i decided i said i have to
[1:20] hold to leave everything away and keep
[1:22] praying
[1:23] so today i went with my wife for they
[1:26] checked my blood pressure it was 138
[1:30] but i think 70 something that's the
[1:32] first time it's been a long time
[1:34] it's been a long time they know me
[1:36] that's my blood pressure is always 160
[1:38] by 100
[1:40] but i don't have no symptom so at the
[1:42] end the doctor said
[1:43] even though it's 138 by 100 you have to
[1:47] keep taking the medicine
[1:48] but in my heart i was like okay i have
[1:51] to keep praying so
[1:53] i can that blood pressure can go below
[1:55] so that's the solution i thank god for
[1:57] that
[1:57] thank you praise the lord
[2:02] amen
[2:05] that actually gives me a testimony
[2:07] myself every time i
[2:09] either go for a checkup or if i go to

[2:43] machine and it said 180.
[2:45] and she's like you need to go to the
[2:46] hospital i was like no the machine's

[15:22] to the church amen so we really really
[15:25] truly appreciate you
[15:27] being here stopping by showing your
[15:30] support
[15:31] and we know that we got big brothers
[15:33] amen
[15:35] blessed be the name of the lord
[15:39] let's go to our scripture tonight thank
[15:41] you
[15:47] i hope everybody is on board since
[15:50] sunday
[15:51] nobody is behind all right amen
[15:54] blessed be the name of the lord we got
[15:56] question and answer coming up
[15:58] one after the other so i can't wait for
[16:01] you
[16:02] to have your cod book
[16:05] so you dig on a cod book you listen to
[16:08] the tip you dig on the bible so when we
[16:10] meet together for question and answer
[16:12] we're traveling left and right before
[16:14] you know it your muscles
[16:16] will be really really really big amen
[16:19] blessed be the name of the lord brother
[16:21] david will start working on this
[16:23] but we on part 32 so it keeps saying the
[16:27] same title but the theme the help that
[16:30] we have been dealing with
[16:31] sometime is different so if you click
[16:34] the link on youtube i don't know when
[16:36] he's going to start this
[16:37] and there will be a title first but
[16:40] there is an arrow that's a description
[16:42] or something like that
[16:43] when you click on the description it
[16:45] will tell you the theme
[16:47] whether we spoke about the high heel
[16:49] whether we spoke about the nail
[16:50] whether we spoke about the long hair
[16:53] whatever was being
[16:54] has been ministering that day you're
[16:56] gonna see it so that
[16:57] that way it's gonna be easier for
[16:59] somebody to track it
[17:01] amen versus going through the numbers
[17:03] sometimes
[17:04] we might be speaking about something
[17:06] else and different
[17:07] amen there was a couple questions that
[17:10] came out
[17:12] and i answered them privately to the
[17:14] individual that
[17:15] asked me but if couple people have that
[17:18] question that means
[17:20] maybe somebody else in the church have
[17:22] it
[17:23] so i was studying something through that
[17:26] line and it seems like the holy spirit
[17:28] brought that thing
[17:29] back again to me so we will
[17:32] touch up on certain things that we
[17:34] already went through a little bit
[17:36] just to tighten some bolt amen and make
[17:39] sure
[17:40] nobody is staying behind this time
[17:43] nobody we're not going to leave even a
[17:45] hoof
[17:47] we all going by the grace of god amen
[17:50] let's go to number
[17:54] chapter 31.
[18:01] we started on sunday we stopped with the
[18:04] earring
[18:05] and i was uh reading
[18:08] brother brown i'm standing
[18:12] along the line of what we have been
[18:14] ministering what branham says that if
[18:16] you didn't know it before
[18:18] he said most of these trouble the mess
[18:20] that we have about our
[18:22] attire the way we we we wear our
[18:25] clothing and things
[18:26] brother branham say it comes from the
[18:28] wrong teaching
[18:29] it's the way people were taught they
[18:30] were not taught properly
[18:32] and what random say but for those that
[18:34] are in the tabernacle
[18:36] if you continue to do it while you have
[18:40] been taught
[18:40] then you become guilty of it amen
[18:44] so whatever you didn't know before we
[18:46] minister here
[18:47] the lord sees that but since we already
[18:50] minister
[18:51] and if you continue wearing long nails
[18:54] and high heel and you don't want to trim
[18:56] your nail you don't want to
[18:58] check your your clothing you don't want
[19:00] to do this thing
[19:01] at this point now you become guilty amen
[19:04] because you know better if you're still
[19:06] wearing your earring we
[19:08] demonstrated to you by the prophet by
[19:10] the bible that hearing is wrong
[19:12] it's a sign of hedonism if you continue
[19:14] doing it
[19:15] at this time you'll become guilty of it
[19:17] and you're going to be judged for it
[19:19] amen so your blood is no longer under my
[19:22] hand
[19:24] amen number 31
[19:28] verse 6. if you dare you can say amen
[19:33] remember last sunday no marriage between
[19:36] israelite and those in the land of
[19:38] canaan
[19:39] amen no marriage
[19:44] verse six and moses sent them to war
[19:48] the children of israel a thousand of
[19:51] every tribe dem and
[19:54] fanihas the son of eliaser the priest
[19:58] to war with the holy instrument and the
[20:00] trumpet to blow in his hand
[20:03] and the war against the midianite
[20:06] remember those women as long
[20:10] as the lord commanded moses and they
[20:13] slew all the water
[20:15] because the male are the carrier of the
[20:18] seed
[20:19] for some reason they didn't sue the
[20:21] women they slew the men
[20:23] what are they going to do to the women
[20:24] remember no marriage between an
[20:26] unbeliever and a believer
[20:28] no marriage between any young man here
[20:31] or any sister here
[20:32] with somebody who's not born again and
[20:35] believe the message of brother branham
[20:37] no marriage you bring it i'm not going
[20:39] to marry you
[20:40] i already told you amen bless the name
[20:43] of the lord
[20:44] brother branham said the success for the
[20:47] success
[20:48] of dwight moody ministry because he was
[20:51] telling the people the truth
[20:53] amen just straight ahead amen
[20:56] verse 8 and they slew the king of media
[21:00] beside the rest of them they were slain
[21:03] namely eva and ricam and zur
[21:06] and er and reba five kings of median
[21:10] balamond saw the son of beer they slew
[21:13] with the sword amen you might be seated
[21:16] verse 9 and the children of
[21:19] israel took all the women of
[21:22] median captive and
[21:26] dele and their little one and took the
[21:28] spoil of all their caddo
[21:31] and all the flock and their goods
[21:33] everybody cleared so far
[21:35] job to verse 14. and moses was
[21:38] angry with the officers of the host
[21:42] not with the people first but with those
[21:45] that are responsible
[21:46] moses got angry because you went with
[21:49] the people you were responsible for the
[21:51] people
[21:51] how did they get into this mess when
[21:54] israel produced the golden calf
[21:57] moses came straight to aaron to the
[21:59] ministry what happened
[22:01] amen and moses was angry
[22:04] that's a prophet with the officers of
[22:06] the host
[22:07] with the captain over thousand and
[22:10] captain over 100
[22:11] which came from the battle and moses
[22:14] said to them
[22:15] have you saved all the women alive
[22:19] in other words they should be killed as
[22:21] well what are you going to do with them
[22:23] amen verse 16 behold
[22:26] these calls the children of israel
[22:30] through the cancer of balaam to commit
[22:34] trespass against the lord in the matter
[22:37] of
[22:37] people you went to wall you killed
[22:41] all the male you killed balaam who was
[22:44] responsible
[22:45] for that teaching but you left the women
[22:48] that were already
[22:49] anointed by that anointing of belem to
[22:52] seduce the children of israel
[22:54] and on sunday we see that there is no
[22:57] marriage
[22:58] that should be taking place between
[23:00] israel and the tribe that were in the
[23:02] promised land
[23:03] amen he said to commit trespass
[23:07] against the lord in the mother appeal
[23:09] and there was a plague among the
[23:11] congregation of the lord in other words
[23:13] you didn't learn
[23:15] we went through this you went and
[23:17] mingled together with strange women
[23:19] remember solomon
[23:20] and you got in trouble and it seems like
[23:23] you have been given a test
[23:24] the second time but you didn't learn to
[23:27] go back again and do the same thing
[23:29] the lord said do not marry with them
[23:33] amen why remember on sunday because
[23:36] their women will turn your heart away
[23:40] from god
[23:40] no matter what you do solomon tried
[23:43] and it was that safe the lord it
[23:46] happened
[23:47] amen now dear therefore
[23:50] kill every male among the little one
[23:53] they kept the children but the male the
[23:55] carrier of the seed
[23:57] kill them because if you leave them they
[23:59] grow up you want to bring that seed back
[24:01] again
[24:02] remember how the serpent seed crossed
[24:04] into the orca
[24:05] because somebody carried the seed amen
[24:08] now therefore kill every male among the
[24:11] little ones
[24:12] and kill every water every woman that
[24:16] has known men by lying with him
[24:18] everybody that was touched by those
[24:21] strangers
[24:22] don't bring her into israel why
[24:26] remember on sunday you are not equipped
[24:29] enough
[24:30] to handle the women of the world
[24:33] amen you stay with your women not the
[24:36] women of the world you are not
[24:37] equipped to handle them amen blessed be
[24:41] the name of the lord
[24:42] verse 18 but all the women
[24:46] children those that have not been
[24:48] touched in other words those that are
[24:50] virgin
[24:51] you see now all the women children
[24:54] that have not known a man by lying with
[24:57] him
[24:58] keep alive for yourself everybody clear
[25:01] so far
[25:02] so you know why he told them stop the
[25:04] other one because you're going to bring
[25:06] that pollution
[25:07] back into the camp amen let's go to
[25:10] deuteronomy chapter 20.
[25:12] blessed be the name of the lord the
[25:15] median and women
[25:16] women cause trouble to the camp of
[25:20] israel god killed many people
[25:22] and never forget that never forgive that
[25:25] sin
[25:26] and they went back again to test again
[25:29] and they fail
[25:30] amen deuteronomy chapter 20
[25:34] verse 12. if you dare you can say amen
[25:38] remember those were the medianite
[25:41] women under the teaching the anointing
[25:44] of berlin
[25:46] which is just nothing but a another form
[25:50] of jezebel a morphe
[25:53] amen remember we went through that
[25:56] verse 12. if you dare you can say amen
[25:59] and if and if it will make no peace with
[26:04] you
[26:05] but will make war against you then
[26:08] you shall be sieged talking about a city
[26:11] amen
[26:12] and when the lord your god has delivered
[26:15] it
[26:15] into your hand deliver a city unto your
[26:18] hand
[26:19] you shall smite water every male
[26:23] thereof with the edge of the sword we
[26:25] don't want carrier of the scene
[26:27] kill him but the women
[26:31] come out and the little ones and the
[26:34] caddo
[26:35] and all that is in the city even
[26:38] all the spoiled thereof shall you take
[26:42] to yourself
[26:43] and you shall eat the spoil of your
[26:45] enemy
[26:46] what they did on number because that's
[26:49] exactly what it did or number
[26:51] moses was angry because women
[26:54] caused trouble to the camp of israel
[26:57] before
[26:58] brother branham said they begin to dance
[27:00] and world
[27:01] and when israel look remember on sunday
[27:03] they seen
[27:04] a whim women that were different than
[27:06] the israelites
[27:07] you can't go back that road anymore amen
[27:11] blessed be the name of the lord verse 15
[27:15] thus shall you do to all
[27:18] the cities which are very what
[27:22] very far off from you in other words
[27:25] you're going
[27:26] in the land of canaan remember the land
[27:29] of canaan
[27:30] have inhabited already and we
[27:32] demonstrated to you that
[27:34] those inhabitants were from the seed of
[27:37] cain
[27:37] brother branham explained that amen so
[27:40] when you go to the promised land do not
[27:42] marry
[27:43] anybody in the promised land but if you
[27:46] go to war
[27:47] not with the people of the promised land
[27:50] the people
[27:50] that are far away because those in the
[27:54] promised land
[27:54] carry the serpentine remember
[27:58] very specific thus verse 15
[28:02] shall you do to all the cities which are
[28:04] very far
[28:05] not in the land of israel from you
[28:09] which are not of the cities of this
[28:12] water
[28:13] i don't want you to mingle with israel
[28:16] so when you go with the cities that are
[28:19] already in the land of israel
[28:21] whether it's a woman or a male whether
[28:24] it's a virgin or what
[28:25] kill everybody don't leave nothing but
[28:28] if the city is very
[28:30] far away in other words the city
[28:33] is not under the influence of the
[28:36] inhabitant of the land of canaan
[28:39] at that point take only the virgins
[28:43] make sense now amen thus
[28:47] shall you do to all the cities which are
[28:50] very far off from you
[28:52] which are not the cities of this nation
[28:55] verse 16
[28:56] but of the series of the people which
[28:59] the lord your god
[29:02] does give you for an inheritance
[29:04] remember this on sunday
[29:06] you shall save a love water
[29:09] kill everything nothing that breathes
[29:12] but you shall orderly destroy them
[29:16] namely the high tide and the homo right
[29:20] the canaanite and the parasite
[29:24] they have fight and the jebusite as the
[29:27] lord your god has commanded
[29:29] you why verse 18 that they teach you
[29:33] not to do after all their abomination
[29:38] which they have done to their god so
[29:41] should you sin
[29:42] against so should you sin against the
[29:45] lord jeopard
[29:47] there is something about the canaanite
[29:49] women brother branham said
[29:50] from the lineage of can domingo with
[29:53] them amen
[29:54] and we sin that cain that's where the
[29:56] anointing of jezebel came from
[29:59] amen let's go to deuteronomy 21
[30:02] then we're going to pray
[30:05] amen the medianite kill him
[30:09] because the wrong influence under the
[30:10] teaching of bellum
[30:12] those that are very far away not under
[30:14] the influence
[30:16] get on in the virgin not the other one
[30:18] because you're not equipped
[30:19] to handle them deuteronomy 21
[30:23] verse 10 if you dare you can say amen
[30:25] this is the scripture we use for long
[30:27] nails
[30:29] amen verse 13
[30:33] verse 12. but we said it should be ten
[30:37] when you go forth to war against your
[30:39] enemy another one
[30:41] and the lord your god has delivered them
[30:44] this is right after deuteronomy 20.
[30:46] now he give more specific he get more
[30:49] specific
[30:50] and the lord your god has delivered them
[30:52] into your hands
[30:54] and you have taken them captive remember
[30:56] the women are taken captive
[30:59] and see among their captive a beautiful
[31:03] woman not those in the land of canaan
[31:06] because those in the land of canaan you
[31:07] killed them
[31:08] amen these are far away if you see a
[31:11] beautiful woman
[31:12] and have a desire to her that you should
[31:16] have her
[31:17] for your lover
[31:21] you see now not to play with it for your
[31:24] wife
[31:25] it's a covenant then you shall bring her
[31:28] home
[31:28] to your house and she shall shave
[31:32] her head why does this woman
[31:36] have to shave her head
[31:40] number one shave her head
[31:43] what was in that woman here that needed
[31:47] to be shaved
[31:49] amen praise god
[31:52] amen number two and pear
[31:56] or trim her nail we already talked about
[31:58] this sister are not supposed to have
[32:00] long nails
[32:01] even the little beauty that the devil
[32:03] trying to tell you
[32:04] get them off amen
[32:09] even your cdc will tell you that
[32:13] amen verse 13 and she shall put the
[32:16] remnant
[32:17] of her captivity from off of her that
[32:20] remnant here have to come off
[32:23] and shall remain in your house and
[32:26] beware
[32:27] her husband
[32:30] okay somebody is not sleeping and beware
[32:33] her father
[32:34] and mother a full month not her husband
[32:38] because those that has been touched what
[32:40] do you do to them you kill them
[32:42] father and mother because she's still
[32:44] under the headship of the father
[32:47] she's still virgin these these are the
[32:49] ones you handle
[32:50] everybody clear now read between the
[32:53] between the line her father and her
[32:55] mother a full month
[32:57] and after that you shall go into her
[33:00] and be her lover
[33:04] her husband and she shall be your wife
[33:08] in other words she got to go through the
[33:10] transformation
[33:11] she got to be born again amen she got up
[33:15] died from her
[33:17] birth of her father and mother died
[33:20] again

[33:24] from her

[33:37] your love your mercy father
[33:39] and for everything you have been doing
[33:40] for us father thank you for giving us

[34:19] devil in his army be completely
[34:22] sealed out of this place and father may
[34:25] you bring us

[34:28] as we humbly ask it
[34:30] in the name of jesus christ amen
[34:33] praise the name of the lord on sunday we
[34:36] read this scripture with you
[34:38] on second corinthians chapter 6 verse 14
[34:41] to 18. i just want to brush to this
[34:43] quickly
[34:44] be not an equally yolk together with
[34:47] unbelievers
[34:49] clear for what fellowship there is no
[34:51] fellowship
[34:53] has righteousness with unrighteousness
[34:55] the righteousness are the children of
[34:57] god
[34:58] because we become the righteousness of
[35:00] god by accepting christ
[35:02] amen with the unrighteous which are the
[35:04] unbeliever
[35:05] and what communion have light with
[35:08] darkness amen jesus said i am the light
[35:12] of the world
[35:13] and he turned again he said you are the
[35:15] light of the world
[35:17] amen so we are the children of light
[35:20] we must reflect that light and not be in
[35:23] communion
[35:24] with darkness everybody so far and what
[35:27] conquer there is no agreement
[35:29] that has christ with belial and what
[35:32] part
[35:33] has he that believed with an infidel
[35:35] they don't even believe your god
[35:36] you're not going to convert them you're
[35:38] not going to change them amen
[35:40] they don't want to learn about you just
[35:42] like jezebel she entered
[35:44] different than ruth ruth wanted to die
[35:46] from her god
[35:48] help people everything else and be
[35:50] partaker
[35:52] of the commonwealth of israel through
[35:54] their religion
[35:55] amen but jezebel want to enter the
[35:59] congregation
[36:00] but still keep their old life
[36:03] and what agreement has the temple of god
[36:06] which you are
[36:07] with adults so these women are adults
[36:10] you hear american adults for you are the
[36:13] temple
[36:13] of the living god as god have said i
[36:16] will dwell in them
[36:18] and walk in them and i will be their god
[36:20] and they shall be my
[36:22] people wherefore come out from among
[36:25] them and be
[36:26] separated say the lord and touch not the
[36:29] unclean thing
[36:30] and i will receive you god want or call
[36:34] for a total separation with what
[36:37] unbelief
[36:38] everything that has a threat of hidden
[36:41] completely separates yourself from that
[36:44] everybody clear so far so we on part 32
[36:47] amen
[36:49] on sunday we were dealing with jezebel
[36:52] we dealt with her spiritually
[36:54] on revelation 17 and on revelation
[36:57] 18 we are still dealing with her
[36:59] naturally amen
[37:01] we found out that there were three major
[37:03] key with jezebel
[37:04] her induction was through forbidden
[37:07] marriage
[37:08] it was not like roof we explained you
[37:09] this on sunday
[37:11] and once you get the spirit of jezebel
[37:13] it revolves the old pollution
[37:16] that you escaped that's why during the
[37:18] reign of ahab
[37:19] jericho was rebuilt back again amen
[37:22] once you go back that route
[37:24] automatically your old life will come
[37:26] back up again amen
[37:28] and jezebel also bring hiddenism or
[37:31] pagan custom that's what we talk about
[37:34] the painting of the nail and everything
[37:36] now brother branham says this this is
[37:38] still very important
[37:40] he said now what a difference in this
[37:42] day
[37:43] in this day of conception instead of
[37:47] him being her ruler this is a problem in
[37:50] america
[37:51] she has become his god remember the
[37:54] temple of the lord and adult she becomes
[37:56] a god
[37:57] sure she rules him under no
[38:00] circumstances
[38:01] a woman should be the ruler of the home
[38:05] let me drive this and then you will see
[38:07] now you can probably well understand
[38:10] what i have been hitting it
[38:12] buy her water remember those three
[38:15] elements
[38:16] very important number one brother
[38:18] branham say by her beauty
[38:21] amen and number two by her sex control
[38:26] that's why you don't marry a woman
[38:28] outside that has been touched by a man
[38:31] you don't know how to handle it amen
[38:34] but by her beauty and her sex control
[38:38] and her water and her ship number three
[38:45] by beauty we know that we're talking
[38:47] about the face
[38:49] amen by sex control we know what it
[38:52] means
[38:53] and by shape we're talking about the
[38:55] body form
[38:58] and when we're going to get under the
[39:00] high heel you're going to see that there
[39:02] is two specific area
[39:04] that these work they work on the torso
[39:09] the chest amen and the second one is
[39:12] going to work on the waist
[39:15] this is what your high heel does to you
[39:17] i will prove it on sunday if the lord
[39:19] willing
[39:20] i don't know why i tried to get it and
[39:22] there's still a blockage amen
[39:24] somebody said brother stephen wait till
[39:26] i come back and you can minister that
[39:29] so by her beauty and her sex control
[39:32] her shape that was given to her by who
[39:36] so you must be very careful not to try
[39:40] and very careful on this area your
[39:42] beauty must be natural
[39:45] amen blessed be the name of the lord
[39:48] they byproduct that certainty
[39:51] she is sent to deceive the sons of god
[39:55] and she can sway more of them to hell
[39:58] than any other instrument
[40:01] satan has got in other words this is the
[40:04] top
[40:05] instrument of satan this is the top
[40:10] amen this is the top
[40:14] the top weapon and this
[40:18] reflects the church whatever you see in
[40:22] the women
[40:23] that's exactly what is happening in the
[40:24] church amen
[40:26] that is exactly right i am talking off
[40:29] any more of the immoral now
[40:32] in other words an immoral woman is a
[40:35] woman
[40:36] that will try to control a man by her
[40:39] beauty
[40:40] can you say amen by his sex control and
[40:43] by her sheep
[40:45] you're not supposed to control a man by
[40:48] this
[40:49] a man should be controlled by the holy
[40:52] ghost and peter said that a woman should
[40:55] have
[40:56] a good life so that by your life
[40:59] not by your preaching you can convert a
[41:02] husband that does not know the lord
[41:05] so you are controlling your husband by
[41:07] the life of christ
[41:09] in your life anybody clear
[41:12] i am talking of the immoral now not you
[41:16] sisters
[41:16] we shall give your place right place in
[41:19] a few minutes in the word
[41:21] of the god of the lord here everybody
[41:24] clear
[41:24] now in second king chapter 9 verse 30
[41:28] last week last sunday the bible says
[41:31] that when jehu
[41:33] was come to jezreel jezebel
[41:36] heard of it she heard that a man was
[41:38] coming and she did three things
[41:41] number one she did water she painted her
[41:45] face
[41:47] this is sunday uh wednesday so let me go
[41:50] up slowly
[41:51] she painted her face brother branham
[41:54] said
[41:54] she's controlling by water which is the
[41:57] face
[41:59] you understand now she painted her face
[42:02] number two she did water she tired her
[42:06] head
[42:06] and we're gonna see what i mean tonight
[42:10] and number three she did water she
[42:13] looked out to the window
[42:16] you wonder why your internet was called
[42:18] window
[42:21] do you think they did it just by any
[42:23] chance
[42:26] amen and she painted her face
[42:29] and tired her head and look out at the
[42:32] window
[42:33] this painting of the face have a purpose
[42:37] what is the purpose of it jeremiah 4
[42:40] verse 30
[42:41] and when they are spoiled
[42:45] what will that do though that closet
[42:48] that self with crimson remember
[42:51] peter and paul were against costly
[42:54] apparel
[42:54] you remember that when they were talking
[42:57] about a prostituted woman
[42:59] though you deck deal with ornament of
[43:02] water
[43:03] remember peter and paul both say costly
[43:06] apparel
[43:07] gold and silver and then they talk about
[43:10] the hair
[43:10] amen now do that deck is deal with
[43:14] ornament of gold
[43:16] though that went test that face with
[43:19] water
[43:20] this was speaking about the children of
[43:23] israel
[43:24] israel did not have a custom
[43:27] to paint their face but for some reason
[43:31] this anointing entered into the
[43:33] congregation of israel
[43:35] and the daughter of zion found
[43:38] themselves doing these kind of things
[43:40] but what is the purpose of painting your
[43:44] face
[43:44] jezebel though
[43:48] directed that face with water
[43:51] painting in vain shall they make the
[43:54] self white
[43:56] for who so the painting of the face
[44:00] is to increase the element of beauty
[44:04] that's why brother branham said the
[44:06] beauty of the women
[44:07] increased so much and the max factor
[44:11] those that make those powder and
[44:13] everything are making so much money
[44:15] because the children of god the sons of
[44:19] god
[44:19] will begin to fulfill the the prophecy
[44:23] that was in the time of noah
[44:25] as he was in the days of noah so shall
[44:27] it be the days of the
[44:29] son of man when the sons of god begin to
[44:31] look at the daughters of men
[44:33] they care night that they were beautiful
[44:36] what made those came out
[44:37] beautiful because they have the art to
[44:40] increase the beauty
[44:42] this beauty is not what they have it's
[44:45] an artificial beauty
[44:49] it is a beauty that looks good on
[44:51] facebook
[44:53] it looks good on whatsapp it looks good
[44:56] on instagram
[44:57] but the day you marry her you put her in
[45:00] your home
[45:01] she doesn't look anything like the
[45:04] picture
[45:05] you love it first that's why brother
[45:07] branham said
[45:08] if you want to get married to a woman go
[45:11] see her on her watch day
[45:13] when she's working in the kitchen when
[45:15] she's at home
[45:16] when she has not put all the powder then
[45:19] you know what you're getting
[45:21] you might think she has a light skin
[45:23] you're gonna be deceived
[45:25] just like jacob was deceived one time
[45:28] amen
[45:28] so the purpose to do this is a purpose
[45:32] to please a lover
[45:34] that's why jezebel painted her face
[45:37] because a man was coming
[45:40] so when you do paint your face
[45:43] to put your picture on the internet
[45:45] according to god
[45:47] you wander a spirit of adultery
[45:51] amen and you don't do it remember naked
[45:54] and don't know it
[45:55] and no if not remember that and on the
[45:58] day of judgment you're gonna be
[46:00] responsible
[46:01] for all the men that you have been
[46:04] attracting on the internet
[46:06] amen it is a shame to see a married
[46:09] woman
[46:10] presenting her breasts
[46:14] amen you put a profile and when you look
[46:18] at the profile
[46:19] there is a breast that has been
[46:21] augmented a certain way
[46:23] why do you have to show up your torso
[46:29] you already married them you want us to
[46:32] like it
[46:34] amen blessed be the name of the lord
[46:38] the second thing is tie your head what
[46:41] does he mean
[46:43] brother bonham said so we found jezebel
[46:47] towering her head which was
[46:50] water so the tiring
[46:54] of the head means the cutting
[46:58] of hair
[47:01] what does cutting a hair have to do
[47:04] why was this woman shaven
[47:09] make sense remember paul
[47:12] is he clicking which was cutting her
[47:16] hair
[47:17] rolling it up tiring her head
[47:21] which is a water that's why even
[47:24] a wig for a sister you cannot wear a wig
[47:28] that have the appearance of cutting
[47:31] off of a haircut once you do that you
[47:35] under
[47:35] you are portraying a demonic spirit
[47:40] a jezebel spirit everything you do
[47:44] must be close to nature
[47:48] because that's the way god created you
[47:50] remember we created you wonderfully
[47:53] and everything you must stay appreciate
[47:56] and remain the way god created you
[47:58] if god wanted you to be tall he would
[48:01] have made you tall
[48:02] if god made you short don't put on high
[48:05] heel
[48:10] a woman that cut her hair dishonor
[48:14] her husband the bible said so
[48:18] a dishonorable woman should be
[48:21] divorced and put away
[48:24] so that is a son that she loves somebody
[48:28] water
[48:29] when you cut or you trim your hair maybe
[48:32] you are not
[48:33] aware of it but what god interprets in
[48:37] your life
[48:37] you are telling god you're under a
[48:39] spirit of adultery
[48:42] according to the bible because she
[48:44] dishonor
[48:45] her husband when she does it
[48:48] painted face jezebel now here paint
[48:53] and scissor that cuts your hair that
[48:56] bothers you it is not really the
[48:58] material
[49:00] whatever happened in the natural is just
[49:03] a reflection of a spirit
[49:04] remember on sunday everything that moved
[49:07] moved by
[49:07] spirit amen so it's not really
[49:11] depending it's not really what you do to
[49:13] your hair
[49:14] it's not really what you do to your nail
[49:16] what what gives you the desire to have
[49:19] long nail
[49:21] why you don't want to have short nail
[49:23] why you are the only one
[49:25] that is attracted to make your nail grow
[49:28] what is that thirst coming from that's
[49:32] the key
[49:32] brother bonham say he and the paint
[49:36] and scissors that cuts your head that
[49:38] bothers you
[49:39] it is that spirit in you that make you
[49:43] go get it
[49:44] so it's a demonic spirit that you have
[49:47] been playing around with it
[49:49] and it's that spirit that drives you to
[49:52] do these kind of things
[49:53] and god will judge you by the desire
[49:57] because your desire entertain that demon
[50:01] if you don't like it that demon will go
[50:03] away but as long as you are pleased with
[50:05] it
[50:06] that's the reason why we have been
[50:08] catering
[50:09] condoning or keeping demon for years
[50:13] because of her heart condition that's
[50:15] why malachi 4 comes
[50:17] to turn the water not the head
[50:21] many people have their head turned but
[50:24] not the heart that's why they are living
[50:27] contrary to the message because their
[50:30] heart was never
[50:31] touched
[50:35] it is that spirit in you that makes you
[50:38] go get it
[50:39] that is what it is max factor what do we
[50:42] call it today
[50:44] america there we go thank you you're not
[50:48] you're your modern american
[50:50] mary kay could make all of it
[50:54] he wanted to and lay it over there and
[50:57] if you was
[50:58] a christian you shall never do what
[51:02] in other words if the holy spirit is in
[51:05] you
[51:05] the holy spirit will blocking you will
[51:08] block you from going that route
[51:11] so no matter what the world will do
[51:14] your protection is under the token
[51:17] if the token is in your life it's gonna
[51:20] remove
[51:21] the desire because the worshiper once
[51:24] purged
[51:25] have no more desire for sin
[51:32] amen what the people were doing
[51:35] they were coming in the message under a
[51:37] law
[51:38] and they were trying with their effort
[51:42] amen to leave the message and after a
[51:45] while you're going to blow up
[51:47] it might take 20 years you're going to
[51:50] blow up
[51:50] because you never made it to the person
[51:54] of christ but once the worshiper is
[51:57] purging
[51:58] amen the message becomes a joy
[52:02] it become a peace it becomes something
[52:05] that is your life it is no more a
[52:09] law it is no more a prison
[52:12] you just live like the messenger
[52:15] amen and sometimes you might find
[52:18] yourself doing something
[52:19] and you don't even have a quote and one
[52:22] day you're going to read it you say oh
[52:24] i see it here i didn't know brother but
[52:26] i'm talking about it
[52:27] because you became the message
[52:32] hallelujah hallelujah enough
[52:35] with that word that kind of way amen
[52:39] if you are not where you are supposed to
[52:41] be with the lord
[52:42] don't fool yourself it is homegoing town
[52:45] don't fool yourself with a proud spirit
[52:48] humble yourself
[52:50] amen before the word of god and seek the
[52:53] holy spirit
[52:55] because the showdown has come
[52:59] amen don't worry
[53:02] don't worry don't worry you can work for
[53:04] one week
[53:06] and you are good i'm trying to be good
[53:08] i'm trying to be good
[53:10] and the lord send the test again before
[53:12] you go up you blow up again
[53:14] it is showing you something is not
[53:16] correct there amen
[53:18] amen oh i'm sorry honey i'm sorry i
[53:20] won't do it again
[53:21] by the grace of god i'm going to change
[53:23] you're going to turn pages
[53:25] after prejudice people have been doing
[53:27] this at the end of the year
[53:29] years after year next year i'm going to
[53:31] do this is still not working
[53:33] because the man thing have not been
[53:35] touched
[53:36] amen if you was a christian
[53:40] you never touch it i mean if you was
[53:44] baptized with the holy ghost
[53:48] and living where you are to live
[53:52] that's right and your pastor preached
[53:54] water
[53:56] this pulpit only the message of the hour
[54:01] as pure as he was given
[54:04] i will never by the grace of god don't
[54:07] push me to compromise
[54:09] i'm going to tell you what brother
[54:10] brother i'm saying amen
[54:12] your pastor preached the truth and
[54:15] let you know about it you would not even
[54:18] want him
[54:20] care about it in other words if that
[54:22] thirst
[54:23] is still there if you're still
[54:26] struggling
[54:27] with that thirst it is a signal that
[54:30] something
[54:30] is still wrong put your life in order
[54:35] anybody clear so far now brother brother
[54:38] just explained to us that the tearing of
[54:41] the head
[54:42] is a cutting of the hair what does he
[54:44] mean
[54:45] getting that scissor and cutting it
[54:48] praise the name of the lord
[54:50] amen what is wrong with a woman cutting
[54:53] her hair
[54:55] amen you said cutting hair
[54:59] what is that got to do brother
[55:03] let's stop here just a minute i feel
[55:06] i just feel somebody resented that might
[55:09] have been out
[55:10] on the wire somewhere maybe somebody's
[55:12] streaming
[55:14] listen a hair to a woman
[55:18] is a nazarite vow
[55:22] held to samson was a nazarite
[55:26] vow samson was a man
[55:29] everybody clear and when a woman cuts
[55:33] off her hair
[55:34] she absolutely denies her nazarite
[55:39] vow that she is a bride to her
[55:43] if you don't look at this clearly you're
[55:46] going to get confused
[55:48] brother branham is dealing with a woman
[55:53] in two ways as a church
[55:58] you follow me and as an individual
[56:04] which is a woman herself the person
[56:09] anybody clear keep those two in mind
[56:13] because he said go home and study amen
[56:17] and when a woman cuts off her hair
[56:21] she absolutely denies her nazarite vow
[56:25] that she is the bride of who we're right
[56:28] here
[56:30] in the church amen because
[56:33] there that one thing she support
[56:36] the whole picture how can one thing
[56:40] denies you
[56:43] amen correctly a nazirite
[56:47] is one that is consecrated for a purpose
[56:51] remember we showed you that god created
[56:54] you for a
[56:55] purpose is that right
[56:59] samsung was consecrated to an age
[57:03] and to a purpose therefore he had
[57:06] long hair he had to destroy the
[57:08] philistine
[57:09] the woman that is a child of god
[57:12] let her grow to show
[57:16] that she is consecrated to water
[57:19] every word of god when you catch your
[57:23] hair
[57:25] you are rebelling against the word of
[57:27] god
[57:29] i want this to soak in so you never let
[57:32] somebody bring a caesar close to you
[57:35] amen if she cut it off
[57:38] i don't care how much she dances
[57:40] pentecostal
[57:42] sings is in the choir
[57:45] speaks in tongue runs up and down
[57:49] or has all kind of added society
[57:52] she is what
[57:59] that is
[58:02] when you catch your hair sister from now
[58:05] on
[58:06] you are spiritually dead
[58:12] god serve the lord the word of god
[58:15] first corinthians 14 here she has denied
[58:19] her nazarite vow and sought out to the
[58:22] god of this water
[58:24] the god of jezebel she does it
[58:28] now shame on you lady or woman
[58:31] brother brother why so strong amen
[58:36] and our pentecostal women like that that
[58:39] is too bad
[58:40] that is too bad shame sister
[58:44] there is a letdown somewhere and i hope
[58:47] it is not in the pulpit because usually
[58:49] that's where it started
[58:51] when a clergy when a pastor does not
[58:53] believe what he preaches
[58:55] that's what you have amen remember
[58:58] what a woman is to be she is very what
[59:02] so sister if you have an arrogant spirit
[59:07] something is wrong
[59:11] i hope the whole church was filled today
[59:14] i was talking to someone today when
[59:17] rebecca come to meet isaac
[59:19] did you notice she veiled her face
[59:23] they still do it they don't know what
[59:26] they are doing
[59:27] but the bride veils her face why
[59:30] the man is ahead keep this in mind
[59:34] when we get to correction you're gonna
[59:36] see the nature of a woman
[59:39] is to yield to a man not to control
[59:43] by sex by beauty and worship
[59:46] and that is the reason the church should
[59:49] be veiled
[59:50] you remember i told you brother branham
[59:52] dearly with
[59:53] individual and he goes up to the church
[59:56] about clear
[59:57] that is the reason the church should be
[1:00:00] there
[1:00:00] it's got a head that is water
[1:00:04] so now spiritually speaking the head of
[1:00:07] a woman is crossed
[1:00:10] which is the head of the church anybody
[1:00:13] clear
[1:00:14] individually that's your husband
[1:00:19] if you're not married that is your
[1:00:21] father
[1:00:23] if you need the scripture you see me
[1:00:25] amen
[1:00:27] the woman is supposed to wear long hair
[1:00:30] because of her head
[1:00:35] husband hey which is her what
[1:00:38] you see her brother brother move up and
[1:00:40] down
[1:00:42] amen he is to have
[1:00:45] short hair because of christ we're going
[1:00:48] to get to that
[1:00:50] the woman well longs hair because of the
[1:00:54] angel i thought he was a husband
[1:00:58] now it's angel
[1:01:02] praise god hallelujah
[1:01:06] what is the angel the water
[1:01:15] do you know who your messenger is right
[1:01:20] the messenger a true messenger to the
[1:01:24] church
[1:01:24] you see how brother branham goes back up
[1:01:26] again you see
[1:01:29] individual life the church of god
[1:01:32] universally and he has also
[1:01:35] included something that is called the
[1:01:38] church age
[1:01:40] your age your church age
[1:01:44] the head is the messenger
[1:01:48] at home your head is your husband

[1:01:55] age in your local church the head is the
[1:02:00] pastor
[1:02:02] in your church age now
[1:02:06] the head is the messenger you follow me
[1:02:09] that's why brother branham said the
[1:02:11] seven messenger were pastors
[1:02:14] you understand now and for the bride
[1:02:17] entirely
[1:02:18] from ephesus all the way to laodicea
[1:02:21] the head is crushed you understand now
[1:02:25] so we go by christ the messenger
[1:02:29] the pastor and the husband amen

[1:02:35] who
[1:02:36] and you pastor you must stay under your
[1:02:39] messenger and husband stay under the
[1:02:43] pastor

[1:03:19] himself through the messenger
[1:03:24] and the messenger and his message become
[1:03:27] one
[1:03:29] you follow me then the messenger
[1:03:32] will reflect christ to the local church
[1:03:36] everybody then the pastor must reflect
[1:03:40] also christ on the pulpit
[1:03:42] then the husband must be crushed in your
[1:03:46] home

[1:04:11] messenger to the church that's right
[1:04:13] he will always call it down
[1:04:16] and say it is wrong and so forth
[1:04:20] and the church to be so yielded to jesus
[1:04:24] that he don't claim its own head you see
[1:04:27] how he goes up and down
[1:04:28] its own headship christ is the headship
[1:04:32] of the
[1:04:33] you see that right here amen
[1:04:36] fell we are not our own but we are his
[1:04:41] yielded to him and him alone
[1:04:44] how beautiful everybody clears so far
[1:04:48] now let's go to number six
[1:04:54] brother branham say it's a nazarite vow
[1:04:58] where is that coming from
[1:05:02] number chapter six if you dare you can
[1:05:06] say amen the head is crossed
[1:05:10] then your messenger your messenger will
[1:05:13] point you to christ
[1:05:15] then your local pastor your local pastor
[1:05:18] must be
[1:05:18] under the messenger amen
[1:05:22] and must be faithfully taught
[1:05:26] to get the light from the messenger and
[1:05:28] to spread it up
[1:05:30] and to only repeat what the messenger
[1:05:34] said because it's not the messenger
[1:05:38] it is christ
[1:05:43] number chapter six if you're there you
[1:05:45] can say amen
[1:05:47] verse two speak to the children of
[1:05:50] israel
[1:05:51] and say to them when either what
[1:05:58] man
[1:06:02] man is a he
[1:06:06] or a woman
[1:06:10] she is a she
[1:06:13] everybody know that praise the name of
[1:06:16] the lord
[1:06:18] when either man or woman
[1:06:21] shall separate themselves to vow
[1:06:25] a vow of a nazirite to separate
[1:06:28] themselves to the lord
[1:06:31] he who is he
[1:06:35] why is he not talking about she
[1:06:40] why didn't he say they
[1:06:46] the bible says man or woman when the
[1:06:49] bible begins to give a description
[1:06:52] he begins to only talk about the man
[1:06:55] why not the woman
[1:07:00] hallelujah three
[1:07:04] he no she shall separate himself from
[1:07:07] wine
[1:07:09] and strong drink and shall drink no
[1:07:12] vinegar of wine
[1:07:14] or vinegar of strong drink we already
[1:07:16] preached to you those three things that
[1:07:17] the angel of the lord spoke to brother
[1:07:19] branham
[1:07:20] don't smoke wine and women remember we
[1:07:22] already went through that
[1:07:24] amen neither shall he drink any liquor
[1:07:28] of grapes nor eat moist grapes
[1:07:31] or dried on the day of
[1:07:34] her separation
[1:07:38] he's thank you somebody's awake
[1:07:42] he's separation shall she
[1:07:45] eat not a woman
[1:07:48] he eats nothing that is made of a van
[1:07:51] tree
[1:07:52] from the colonels even to the house
[1:07:56] all the days of the vow of her
[1:08:00] know his separation
[1:08:03] there shall no razor come upon his water
[1:08:07] number one no wine nothing connected to
[1:08:11] wine
[1:08:12] we already explained you wine number two
[1:08:15] the hair
[1:08:16] of the man nazarite not the woman
[1:08:22] amen no razor shall come upon his head
[1:08:27] until the day be fulfilled into which he
[1:08:31] separate himself to the lord he shall be
[1:08:34] water
[1:08:35] holy and shall let the locks of him
[1:08:38] of the hair of his head do what
[1:08:42] grow verse 6
[1:08:45] oh the day that he separate himself to
[1:08:48] the lord
[1:08:49] he shall come at no dead body no
[1:08:52] pollution
[1:08:53] he shall not make himself unclean for
[1:08:56] his father
[1:08:57] or for his mother for his brother or for
[1:08:59] his sister
[1:09:00] when they die because the consequence
[1:09:03] of god is upon his water and nazarite
[1:09:08] the consecration is on the head
[1:09:13] and the head has held
[1:09:17] so the son of a nazarite
[1:09:21] amen was upon the head
[1:09:25] and that sun was the hair
[1:09:28] of the head anybody clear
[1:09:32] remember jezebel cut her hair
[1:09:37] we clear verse 8
[1:09:41] all the day of his separation he is holy
[1:09:45] to who
[1:09:45] to the lord let's get an example here
[1:09:49] judges chapter 13 verse 3 and 5.
[1:09:53] and the angel of the lord appear unto
[1:09:55] the woman
[1:09:56] and say unto her behold now thou are
[1:10:00] barren
[1:10:01] not but that shall conceive and bear a
[1:10:04] wiper
[1:10:06] a man or a woman we're dealing with a
[1:10:09] man about here now
[1:10:12] therefore be aware of prey and drink not
[1:10:16] water we just read it with you about
[1:10:19] clear now
[1:10:20] drink not wine no strong drink we read
[1:10:24] it with you
[1:10:25] and eat not any unclean thing ever here
[1:10:30] for love that shall conceive and bear
[1:10:33] a son not a woman
[1:10:37] and no razor shall come on his water
[1:10:41] everything that was spoken by moses
[1:10:44] was given as an instruction to the
[1:10:48] parent to the mother of samson because
[1:10:50] god
[1:10:51] stays behind his word everybody clear
[1:10:54] for the child amen shall be a water
[1:10:59] a nazareth unto god from the womb
[1:11:02] anybody clear that's why brother branham
[1:11:05] could tap
[1:11:06] samson as a type of
[1:11:10] church understand
[1:11:13] because the church in the bible brother
[1:11:15] bradham said it is type as a woman
[1:11:18] amen but when brother branham preached
[1:11:20] the saved church
[1:11:21] by the world he used samson as a top of
[1:11:25] the church
[1:11:26] because samsung had a nazarite vow on
[1:11:29] his head
[1:11:30] and his hair looked longer like a woman
[1:11:36] a church and an individual
[1:11:41] we clear for the child shall be a
[1:11:44] nazareth brother branham said he even
[1:11:46] looked like a
[1:11:48] because of the hair
[1:11:52] not that he was a sisi
[1:11:56] for the child shall be a nazarite unto
[1:11:59] god from the womb it was consecrated
[1:12:02] from the womb
[1:12:02] and he shall begin to deliver israel out
[1:12:05] of the hand of the philistine
[1:12:08] then the woman came and
[1:12:11] kept the secret to her husband
[1:12:18] a married woman
[1:12:23] should always tell her husband
[1:12:26] everything
[1:12:29] a married woman should not handle
[1:12:32] stuff on herself outside of the marriage
[1:12:36] with men without her husband knowing
[1:12:39] [Music]
[1:12:41] you don't have any private life your
[1:12:44] life and your husband's life are
[1:12:46] together
[1:12:48] your husband should not be surprised
[1:12:52] if somebody tells him that your wife did
[1:12:55] so and so
[1:12:56] even if you messed up come back like
[1:12:59] eve and bring it back home
[1:13:06] then the woman came and told her husband
[1:13:10] saying a man of god came unto me
[1:13:13] and his countenance was like the
[1:13:15] countenance of an angel of god
[1:13:17] very terrible but i asked him not once
[1:13:20] he was
[1:13:21] neither told him told him me his name
[1:13:24] but he says unto me behold that shall
[1:13:27] conceive and bear
[1:13:29] a son and now no
[1:13:32] drink no wine no
[1:13:35] strong drink neither eat any unclean
[1:13:38] thing
[1:13:39] for the child shall be a nazareth to god
[1:13:42] from the womb
[1:13:44] right here to the day of his water
[1:13:47] his entire life samson
[1:13:51] was a nazarite and the son of an azeroth
[1:13:54] the way you recognize him it was not
[1:13:58] because he was a man
[1:13:59] there is only one thing that makes you
[1:14:01] know that a man has been a nazareth
[1:14:04] it is his hair because a woman
[1:14:07] automatically should have long hair
[1:14:09] so you don't know whether she is under
[1:14:11] that consecration or not
[1:14:13] it was usually detected by men
[1:14:16] make sense that's why they give a
[1:14:18] description for the man
[1:14:20] not the woman everybody clear
[1:14:24] let's go to judges 16
[1:14:27] hallelujah amen
[1:14:30] because at the end if you read
[1:14:34] the bible says when these days of
[1:14:36] nazareth are done
[1:14:38] he's going to go and do what and cut his
[1:14:41] head
[1:14:41] the bible never spoke about the woman
[1:14:45] because if you put the woman there then
[1:14:47] the woman can cut her hair
[1:14:49] then paul is under contradiction
[1:14:53] make sense but he never touched the
[1:14:55] woman
[1:14:56] because the man is not good for a man to
[1:14:59] have long hair
[1:15:01] that's why at the end of his nazarite he
[1:15:04] must cut it off
[1:15:05] but not description for the woman
[1:15:08] because other medically she's always
[1:15:10] have long hair you can tell
[1:15:13] that's why the description is only to
[1:15:16] the man
[1:15:16] and the only example given in the bible
[1:15:19] was a man's son
[1:15:24] make sense now i'm going slowly so you
[1:15:26] understand
[1:15:27] why brad branham is against this thing
[1:15:30] and when you soak him
[1:15:31] you will never do that again let's go to
[1:15:34] judges chapter 16.
[1:15:40] because we got demons on the land
[1:15:43] that are killing people it should be in
[1:15:46] the bible it should be in the bible
[1:15:47] okay if you know the message very well
[1:15:51] the message came from the bible so now
[1:15:53] let's grind you in the bible
[1:15:55] back it up with brother branham
[1:15:58] amen judges like paul say we preach
[1:16:01] christ
[1:16:02] according to the revelation of the
[1:16:04] mystery
[1:16:07] you preach christ according to the
[1:16:09] message of the hour
[1:16:11] let's go judges 16 verse 1
[1:16:15] if you dare you can say amen
[1:16:18] what did god told israel when they came
[1:16:20] out of egypt
[1:16:21] do not marry what strange women do not
[1:16:24] mess around with them
[1:16:25] stay away judges chapter 16. remember
[1:16:28] solomon on sunday
[1:16:30] he went after strange women that's why
[1:16:32] the entire book of proverbs
[1:16:34] all over strange women oh how wisdom
[1:16:37] will protect you from strange women
[1:16:39] because solomon
[1:16:40] learned he got burned pretty good amen
[1:16:44] judges 16 verse 1
[1:16:47] then went samson together
[1:16:51] forbidden and so there was a water
[1:16:55] remember jezebel spirit in revelation
[1:16:59] she was the great a harlot
[1:17:02] which is the spirit on the end time now
[1:17:05] samsung
[1:17:06] goes to a harlot amen
[1:17:09] and azerite going to a harlot
[1:17:12] and then went samson to gaza and saw
[1:17:15] there
[1:17:16] a harlot and went into her everybody
[1:17:19] clear
[1:17:20] jump to verse four and he came to pass
[1:17:23] afterward
[1:17:24] that he loved a woman
[1:17:27] in the valley of israel
[1:17:33] makes sense not an israelite in the
[1:17:36] valley of
[1:17:37] sorek whose name was dilala
[1:17:41] god said don't do it he carry his nazar
[1:17:45] advan
[1:17:46] and move on to that and the lord of the
[1:17:49] philistine
[1:17:50] came unto him and said to her entice him
[1:17:55] and see wherein his great strength lies
[1:17:58] and by what means we may prevail against
[1:18:00] him
[1:18:01] that we may burn him to afflict him
[1:18:04] and we will give you every one of us
[1:18:08] 1100 pieces of water
[1:18:12] money the root of all evil
[1:18:15] this woman loved money amen
[1:18:19] in verse 4 the bible says samson loved
[1:18:22] her
[1:18:23] young people you think you love her
[1:18:25] let's see if she loves you
[1:18:28] you there verse 6 and delilah said to
[1:18:32] samson
[1:18:33] tell me i pray you wearing your great
[1:18:36] strength lies
[1:18:38] and where if you might be bound to do
[1:18:41] what
[1:18:42] who is a normal woman in the world
[1:18:46] that can ask your husband i want to know
[1:18:49] how
[1:18:50] do you make money i want to know where
[1:18:53] is the strong
[1:18:54] where is the strength of your business
[1:18:56] and i want to know how we can destroy
[1:18:58] your business
[1:19:03] can you imagine can you imagine
[1:19:07] and samsung loves her
[1:19:10] but do you think when a woman asks that
[1:19:12] question samson will walk up and say
[1:19:15] wait a minute this is not a good woman i
[1:19:17] need to run away with it
[1:19:19] right that's what you think young people
[1:19:22] you
[1:19:22] think you're going to be able to detect
[1:19:24] a jezebel
[1:19:26] you're not going to be you're you're not
[1:19:28] going to be able to be
[1:19:29] able you will not equip for that amen
[1:19:33] normally a normal man when they ask you
[1:19:36] a question
[1:19:36] you want to go home you say maybe at
[1:19:38] your job you say wait a minute
[1:19:40] this woman is asking me where is my
[1:19:43] power to be destroyed
[1:19:45] what what is she looking after samson
[1:19:49] didn't work
[1:19:50] like that why
[1:19:53] that's why god said do not go to those
[1:19:56] women
[1:19:56] because there is power in those women to
[1:19:59] turn you away from me
[1:20:01] you're not going to overcome the only
[1:20:04] thing is the holy spirit
[1:20:06] but the holy spirit will block you even
[1:20:08] to go there
[1:20:11] amen verse seven and simpson said to her
[1:20:15] if they burned me we still under the
[1:20:16] nazareth
[1:20:18] if you're sleeping you can wake up but
[1:20:20] you can stand up there and samsung said
[1:20:22] to her
[1:20:22] if they bind me with seven green wishes
[1:20:26] that will never dry you begin to lie
[1:20:29] because you're already living an unclean
[1:20:31] life
[1:20:32] one demon after another and then
[1:20:36] shall i be weak and be as another man
[1:20:40] then the lords of the philistine brought
[1:20:42] up to her
[1:20:43] seven green wishes which has now been
[1:20:46] drive
[1:20:47] and she burned him with them now
[1:20:51] there were men lying in weight a burning
[1:20:54] with her in the water
[1:20:57] this is what you get for me an outside
[1:21:00] woman
[1:21:01] amen a man you think you're under a
[1:21:05] relationship
[1:21:06] but people are living with you in the
[1:21:08] house
[1:21:09] they might not be physically there but
[1:21:12] open her cell phone
[1:21:14] and look how many men she has in contact
[1:21:17] with
[1:21:20] amen a married woman friends on facebook
[1:21:24] that are men
[1:21:26] why why
[1:21:29] she loves samsung let's see if samsung
[1:21:33] will wake up and say
[1:21:34] enough i need to go back to israel amen
[1:21:38] and she said to him that philistine be
[1:21:41] upon
[1:21:42] you some son and he broke the wisdom
[1:21:46] as a thread of town is broken when he
[1:21:49] touches fire
[1:21:50] so his strength was not known
[1:21:54] you told a woman your secret and in the
[1:21:57] morning and night
[1:21:58] she goes and she binds you and she tells
[1:22:02] you
[1:22:03] the philistine has upon you you woke up
[1:22:05] you found yourself bound
[1:22:08] and you break the bond but you still
[1:22:11] care
[1:22:12] come back to your mind like this woman
[1:22:15] asked me a secret
[1:22:16] i told her and she bind me
[1:22:21] you see how stupid the devil can get you
[1:22:25] do you see do you see stay behind the
[1:22:29] word
[1:22:30] amen verse 10 and delilah said to samson
[1:22:34] behold you have mocked me and told me
[1:22:38] lies
[1:22:39] you're a liar you message believer you
[1:22:41] see now you start lying
[1:22:44] you're living already under fornication
[1:22:46] what kind of sanctification do you
[1:22:50] express
[1:22:52] amen you were mocked me
[1:22:56] and told me lies now tell me i pray you
[1:22:59] where if you might be bound samson
[1:23:01] should stay
[1:23:02] enough what are you looking in my life
[1:23:06] let's see samsung and he said to her if
[1:23:09] they
[1:23:09] burn me with fast with new rope
[1:23:12] that never will occupy then i shall be
[1:23:15] weak
[1:23:15] and as another man what did she do
[1:23:19] she did it again did something change
[1:23:24] let's go to 15 to save time and she said
[1:23:28] to him
[1:23:29] how can you say i love you
[1:23:33] when you're working the woman understood
[1:23:37] that this is a player
[1:23:40] his heart is not with me the heart
[1:23:44] that god is hunting through the ministry
[1:23:47] of brother branham
[1:23:48] the same heart the harlot is hunting it
[1:23:52] remember in the book of proverbs we
[1:23:55] showed you that the harlot is calling
[1:23:57] and which them also is calling folly's
[1:24:00] calling
[1:24:00] wisdom is calling she understood that
[1:24:03] i'm still
[1:24:03] dealing with him intellectually let me
[1:24:06] get to the root
[1:24:08] how do i get into the root under the
[1:24:10] laws of god
[1:24:11] watch him your heart is not with me
[1:24:15] you have mocked me this water three
[1:24:18] times
[1:24:18] you still don't wake up what power
[1:24:22] is in this woman that i'm son of god
[1:24:25] cannot be cannot be awake from a danger
[1:24:30] remember she's controlling by water
[1:24:34] everybody can understand and she's
[1:24:36] controlling by water
[1:24:39] and by water once you uncontrol under
[1:24:42] this your brain don't function
[1:24:44] normal
[1:24:47] they will tell you leave that woman
[1:24:49] alone she's not converted yet
[1:24:52] and you see a young man keep pushing
[1:24:54] keep pushing
[1:24:55] keep pushing because he's blundered by
[1:24:58] the shape of the woman
[1:24:59] he's blunded by the beauty he cannot
[1:25:02] even sit and think and say
[1:25:04] this woman he doesn't have a good
[1:25:06] character no
[1:25:08] he's blinded by beauty sex control
[1:25:12] by shape you can say all you want mama i
[1:25:15] still want her
[1:25:19] she's not a message believer she's so
[1:25:21] sweet we showed you in proverbs
[1:25:23] those women are sweeter sweeter than
[1:25:25] honey
[1:25:29] amen you have mocked me these three
[1:25:32] times
[1:25:33] and have not told me wherein your great
[1:25:35] strength lies about here
[1:25:37] and it came to pass when she pressed him
[1:25:40] out
[1:25:41] daily with her words and urged him
[1:25:45] put him under pressure so that his what
[1:25:48] finally the door to the heart the soul
[1:25:52] open up was vexed to death
[1:25:55] that he told her all his heart and said
[1:25:58] to her
[1:25:59] there was no come there there has not
[1:26:01] come a razor upon my what
[1:26:04] the nazareth is open for i have been a
[1:26:07] welcome
[1:26:09] now say hi to who to god from my
[1:26:11] mother's womb
[1:26:12] and if i be saved then my strength will
[1:26:15] go from me
[1:26:16] and i shall become weak and be like any
[1:26:19] other man
[1:26:21] and when delala saw that he told her all
[1:26:24] his heart
[1:26:25] she sent and called for the lords of the
[1:26:27] philistine say come up this one
[1:26:30] for he had shown me all his heart then
[1:26:32] the lords of the philistine came up to
[1:26:34] her
[1:26:35] and brought money in their hand and she
[1:26:37] made him sleep upon water
[1:26:42] how did she make samsung sleeper
[1:26:45] you don't need a sleep pills she's
[1:26:48] controlling you
[1:26:50] by her body by her beauty by her shape
[1:26:54] what happened to samson three times
[1:26:57] brother branham said those three times
[1:26:58] shows luther
[1:27:00] wesley pentecost are you there
[1:27:04] and finally the church was getting under
[1:27:07] satan and what did they do they blinded
[1:27:10] him because laodicea is
[1:27:14] enter the territory of the devil
[1:27:20] everybody clear everybody clear
[1:27:23] jump to verse 22 however
[1:27:26] he the hair of his head began to grow
[1:27:28] again after he was what
[1:27:31] they shave him completely when they
[1:27:33] shave samson
[1:27:35] you follow me the power is gone
[1:27:39] when they cut the hair the power is gone
[1:27:43] the consecration is gone and it takes
[1:27:45] the power away
[1:27:47] what is wrong in the hair amen
[1:27:52] amen let's go to first corinthian 11
[1:27:55] then i will stop a certain time then we
[1:27:57] will continue
[1:27:59] let's go now to first corinthian 11. you
[1:28:01] understand
[1:28:02] jezebel towering her head we already
[1:28:04] talked about the painted face
[1:28:06] she cut her hair what is important about
[1:28:09] this brother bottom explained to us
[1:28:10] about the head
[1:28:11] of the church being crushed the head of
[1:28:14] the church ages the messenger
[1:28:16] in your home your husband or your father
[1:28:18] if you are not married
[1:28:20] in your church the pastor and then the
[1:28:22] shaving of the head
[1:28:24] the nazarite vow is a son to man
[1:28:27] in the head ever clear and the woman as
[1:28:30] well but a woman is hard to tell because
[1:28:31] she already have
[1:28:33] long hair let's go to first quarantine
[1:28:35] 11 now
[1:28:37] i have to build this up so you
[1:28:38] understand first corinthians 11. you
[1:28:42] ready now
[1:28:44] let's get this now let you go home be ye
[1:28:47] followers of me remember this we talked
[1:28:50] about them
[1:28:51] me who paul paul was there
[1:28:55] messenger you understand now be your
[1:28:58] followers of
[1:28:59] me the messenger even as i am also
[1:29:03] follower of what
[1:29:04] of who crossed you see this now it makes
[1:29:07] sense
[1:29:08] it's clear verse 2
[1:29:12] now i praise you brethren that you
[1:29:14] remember me
[1:29:15] in all things let me read it again
[1:29:19] i praise you present that you remember
[1:29:22] jesus in all things is that what he says
[1:29:27] remembering who remembering the
[1:29:30] messenger in
[1:29:32] everything everything in your life
[1:29:36] you must check it with the word of your
[1:29:39] day
[1:29:43] you want to do something did you check
[1:29:46] the word
[1:29:47] or you just take a decision because it
[1:29:49] is my life
[1:29:53] amen and keep the ordinance
[1:29:57] as i have as i delivered them to who
[1:30:02] why do we have to keep the ordinance
[1:30:04] exactly like
[1:30:06] paul gave it remember
[1:30:09] jericho remember those two
[1:30:12] boys that went there brother branham
[1:30:14] said they played what
[1:30:16] a man playing tapes was tapes over there
[1:30:19] you remember what we spoke on sunday the
[1:30:21] tape became human
[1:30:24] amen when they speak they like a tape
[1:30:27] they are just repeating what the
[1:30:29] messenger
[1:30:30] said they don't have any thought of
[1:30:32] their own
[1:30:33] because the thought of the messenger is
[1:30:35] not really the thought of the messenger
[1:30:37] it is the thought of christ
[1:30:43] keep this right here i'm going to come
[1:30:45] back drop to
[1:30:46] verse 23 why do we have to keep it just
[1:30:49] like paul gave it
[1:30:53] for i have wanted receive of who
[1:30:58] that which also i did what so why did
[1:31:01] paul
[1:31:02] get this information now let's go back
[1:31:04] again
[1:31:06] let's go back again now verse two
[1:31:10] now i praise you president that you
[1:31:12] remember me in all things
[1:31:14] keep the ordinance as i did what
[1:31:18] but paul just told us that what he
[1:31:20] delivered he gathered from who
[1:31:22] that's why you keep it exactly like he
[1:31:24] was given
[1:31:25] because it's not coming from a man it's
[1:31:27] coming from god
[1:31:28] it is we are not feeding upon the word
[1:31:31] of man
[1:31:32] but we are feeling informed there and
[1:31:34] failing by the word of the
[1:31:36] son of man make sense i deliver them
[1:31:40] unto you watch now verse three but i
[1:31:43] would have you know
[1:31:45] that the head of every man is who
[1:31:49] watch here
[1:31:52] make sense thank you come on
[1:31:56] and the head of every man is christ
[1:32:00] and the head of every woman is who
[1:32:03] do you see what i gave you here
[1:32:07] make sense now clear come
[1:32:10] up and the head of christ is who
[1:32:15] if you look here it looks like we have
[1:32:18] four people
[1:32:23] brother branham question and answer
[1:32:25] followers of me
[1:32:27] as i am of christ paul said you follow
[1:32:30] me
[1:32:31] just as i follow why is brother branham
[1:32:34] saying that
[1:32:35] read between the line now i praise you
[1:32:38] brethren
[1:32:39] that you remember me in all things and
[1:32:41] keep
[1:32:42] off the ordinance as i delivered unto
[1:32:45] you
[1:32:45] but i would have you to know that the
[1:32:48] head of every man is who
[1:32:50] and the head of the woman is who and the
[1:32:54] head of christ is who
[1:32:56] see how it is who god
[1:33:00] man four people
[1:33:06] god is perfected in what why do we have
[1:33:10] forward
[1:33:13] you ready let's get this and we go home
[1:33:18] the head of christ is god
[1:33:21] that's what paul said and the head of
[1:33:24] the man is crust
[1:33:26] and the head of the woman is the man so
[1:33:29] the bottom line is the woman
[1:33:32] and the top is who
[1:33:37] when we spoke about wisdom and
[1:33:39] understanding
[1:33:41] are you ready now just get ready and
[1:33:43] we're going to go home
[1:33:45] god we found out that god
[1:33:48] was portrayed as the understanding
[1:33:52] you remember that somebody missed this
[1:33:54] everybody clear
[1:33:56] then we found that christ was the wisdom
[1:33:59] of god
[1:34:00] you follow me it is not really through
[1:34:04] four people it is actually true
[1:34:10] i who the wisdom of god is who
[1:34:15] christ our wisdom dwell with prudence
[1:34:18] and find out knowledge of witty
[1:34:20] invention
[1:34:22] counsel is mine and sound wisdom i
[1:34:25] am water so wisdom and understanding are
[1:34:28] water
[1:34:30] i am a father as well
[1:34:35] the lord possessed me in the beginning
[1:34:38] of his way
[1:34:39] before his work of old i was set up from
[1:34:42] water
[1:34:44] from the beginning the jehovah of the
[1:34:46] old testament
[1:34:48] is jesus in the new testament when there
[1:34:51] were no depth
[1:34:52] i was brought forth we explained to you
[1:34:54] this as a logos
[1:34:56] when there was no front and a bonding
[1:34:58] with water before the mountain was
[1:35:00] settled before the hills
[1:35:02] i was brought forth in other words i was
[1:35:04] birthed
[1:35:05] when he prepared the heaven i was dead
[1:35:08] when he set that a compass upon the face
[1:35:11] of the death
[1:35:13] then i was by him as one brought up with
[1:35:16] water
[1:35:17] through the process of kinosis and
[1:35:20] in more faith than god changed from the
[1:35:24] spirit
[1:35:24] into the pillar of fire everybody follow
[1:35:27] me
[1:35:28] and i was dealing his delight rejoicing
[1:35:31] always before
[1:35:33] that's why brother branham said he was
[1:35:35] playing like a child
[1:35:36] brother branham never give you a
[1:35:38] scripture perfectly in line with the
[1:35:40] scripture
[1:35:41] everybody clear so god and christ are
[1:35:44] water
[1:35:45] we don't have four people we have three
[1:35:47] people
[1:35:48] make sense now thank you now
[1:35:53] he revealed that deep and the secret
[1:35:56] thing
[1:35:56] he know if word is in darkness and the
[1:35:59] light
[1:35:59] dwelleth with who because god
[1:36:03] was a spirit we know that but that
[1:36:05] spirit
[1:36:06] in more faith into a light i
[1:36:09] already preached on this and that light
[1:36:12] was the logos
[1:36:13] which was the pillar of fire anybody
[1:36:16] clear
[1:36:17] you already know that psalm 104 somebody
[1:36:21] asked this question
[1:36:22] bless the lord all my soul oh lord
[1:36:25] my god they are very great
[1:36:28] there are clubs with water honor and
[1:36:32] majesty
[1:36:33] who cover up that self with water
[1:36:36] remember when jesus was taken up he
[1:36:39] entered into a
[1:36:41] cloud which was the pillar of cloud
[1:36:45] in the night the pillar of fire i came
[1:36:48] from god
[1:36:49] i'm going back to god you understand now
[1:36:52] first timothy 6 that that keeps this
[1:36:55] commandment with us part
[1:36:57] are rebukable until the appear of who
[1:37:01] our lord jesus christ which in his time
[1:37:05] he shall show who is the blessed
[1:37:08] and the only water patented
[1:37:11] the king of kings the lord of
[1:37:15] lords who only has water
[1:37:19] immortality melchizedek dwelling
[1:37:23] in the water everybody clear
[1:37:26] in the light which no man can approach
[1:37:30] whom no man has seen nor can what
[1:37:33] see so god dwell in the light
[1:37:37] everybody clear in the beginning was the
[1:37:41] and the word was with and the word was
[1:37:45] water
[1:37:47] god and cluster
[1:37:51] the same was in the beginning wisdom
[1:37:54] all things were made by him and without
[1:37:57] him was not anything that was made
[1:38:00] in him was water and the life was the
[1:38:03] light offer
[1:38:07] john 1 14 and the word was made water
[1:38:11] now it's no more the pillar of fire it
[1:38:14] becomes a human being
[1:38:18] the pillar of fire took on skinner
[1:38:21] and the world was made water and dwell
[1:38:24] among us
[1:38:25] and we behead his water the glory as the
[1:38:30] only begotten after
[1:38:32] he was birth the logos and when he was
[1:38:36] birthed the logos
[1:38:37] by kenosis when he comes out he pick up
[1:38:41] god
[1:38:41] and he put god in him
[1:38:45] do you understand kenosis
[1:38:48] is not this are you there
[1:38:52] kinosis is this
[1:38:57] you follow me so when god was birthing
[1:39:01] christ
[1:39:02] christ means the fullness of god
[1:39:06] so as christ was coming out of the bosom
[1:39:09] of god
[1:39:10] he also picked god with him and he sack
[1:39:13] him
[1:39:17] great is the mystery of godliness the
[1:39:20] word was made flesh
[1:39:22] and dwell among us and we behead his
[1:39:24] glory
[1:39:25] the glory of the only begotten of the
[1:39:27] father full of grace and truth
[1:39:30] no man has seen god at any time
[1:39:33] the only word begotten of the son
[1:39:37] the only begotten son which is in the
[1:39:41] bosom of the father has declared him
[1:39:45] so he came as a kingsman
[1:39:48] you follow me hallelujah wherefore
[1:39:52] when he cometh into the world he said
[1:39:55] sacrifice an offering that would not but
[1:39:59] a what the pillar of fire needed a body
[1:40:02] that has prepared me first corinthians 2
[1:40:05] corinthians 4
[1:40:06] 4. in whom the god of this world has
[1:40:10] branded the mind
[1:40:11] of them which believe not lest the light
[1:40:14] of the glorious gospel of who
[1:40:16] come out who is the water colossian
[1:40:20] 1 14 in whom we have redemption through
[1:40:24] his blood
[1:40:25] even the forgiveness of sin who is the
[1:40:28] water
[1:40:29] of the invisible water the firstborn
[1:40:32] among every
[1:40:33] so jesus was god manifested in flesh
[1:40:38] everybody clear hallelujah yes
[1:40:42] in this last day spoken to us by his
[1:40:45] word
[1:40:46] whom he has appointed air of all things
[1:40:49] by whom also he made the wisdom
[1:40:52] who bring the water brightness of his
[1:40:56] and the express image of water
[1:41:00] oh my god again when he bringeth in the
[1:41:04] first begotten
[1:41:06] into the world he said let all his god
[1:41:09] let all the angel of god do what why do
[1:41:12] you worship the son
[1:41:14] but unto the son he said that throne oh
[1:41:17] son
[1:41:19] [Music]
[1:41:25] his name shall be called water counselor
[1:41:31] you calling a son mighty god everlasting
[1:41:34] what
[1:41:35] how can a son be everlasting father
[1:41:37] again
[1:41:41] but unto the son he said that throne oh
[1:41:44] so that son is a god hallelujah
[1:41:49] that which was from the beginning which
[1:41:52] we have heard
[1:41:53] which we have seen with our eyes
[1:41:57] which we have and our hand have handed
[1:42:00] the water
[1:42:01] the logos was handled in the person of
[1:42:04] jesus christ
[1:42:06] for their life was manifested and we
[1:42:09] have seen it
[1:42:10] and bear witness and show unto you that
[1:42:13] eternal life
[1:42:14] which was with who and was manifested
[1:42:17] unto us
[1:42:18] and then is the message which we have
[1:42:22] heard of him
[1:42:23] and declare unto you that god is what
[1:42:26] and in him there is no water so he is a
[1:42:29] king's man
[1:42:30] and he is also your brother
[1:42:34] god has love righteousness and hated
[1:42:37] iniquity
[1:42:38] therefore even
[1:42:41] who is god
[1:42:45] therefore god even that god has anointed
[1:42:48] thee
[1:42:49] with all of goodness above that he is
[1:42:52] your brother
[1:42:54] and lord in the beginning has laid the
[1:42:57] foundation of the earth
[1:42:59] remember proverb romans 8 17
[1:43:02] if children then water as we flow out of
[1:43:05] who
[1:43:06] and do what with who
[1:43:10] he's your brother ever clear
[1:43:13] then solomon in proverbs 7 say call
[1:43:16] wisdom
[1:43:17] your what your sister and call
[1:43:20] understanding your water
[1:43:23] god understanding christ
[1:43:27] the wisdom through which the supreme
[1:43:29] intelligence immortal
[1:43:30] to begin to create then he dropped down
[1:43:34] and the word was made flesh
[1:43:35] to become a king's men to become a
[1:43:38] brother to us
[1:43:39] then while that was in god he poured
[1:43:41] into
[1:43:43] and all that was in class he pour into
[1:43:45] the
[1:43:46] and the church becomes the bride
[1:43:50] when you get into the brad baptist you
[1:43:52] are also
[1:43:53] you get your kids to become a king's
[1:43:56] woman
[1:43:57] jerusalem that's the church a
[1:43:59] condescending
[1:44:01] a condescending right there in first
[1:44:03] corinthians god
[1:44:05] christ man woman the spirit of god
[1:44:09] condescended to the logos all of them
[1:44:13] become one then from the logos he was
[1:44:16] made flesh into a man
[1:44:18] the man is the head of the church
[1:44:21] you follow me you follow me now and that
[1:44:24] church
[1:44:25] is a woman and that woman is the body
[1:44:29] that's why in sunset mountain when the
[1:44:31] picture came
[1:44:32] they turned the picture to the right
[1:44:34] everything that was in the picture was
[1:44:36] nothing but the water
[1:44:39] and that head was who
[1:44:43] everybody here wife
[1:44:46] submit yourself and to your husband as
[1:44:49] unto the what
[1:44:51] why a woman must respect you like god
[1:44:56] i'm gonna stop her for a
[1:44:59] husband is the water
[1:45:03] you understand now paul this is ephesian
[1:45:07] even as christ look how paul play with
[1:45:10] the two
[1:45:11] the natural and he goes back up to the
[1:45:14] spiritual the husband is the head of the
[1:45:17] wife
[1:45:19] husband and wife even as christ
[1:45:22] is the head of the church spiritual
[1:45:26] and he is the savior of the body
[1:45:28] therefore as the
[1:45:30] church is subject time to christ
[1:45:32] spiritual
[1:45:33] so let the wife natural be still
[1:45:36] be to their own not somebody else's
[1:45:42] husband somebody else's husband want his
[1:45:45] wife to do the hair like this
[1:45:46] you also want to do your hair like this
[1:45:52] for no man ever yet hated his own flesh
[1:45:56] but nourishes and cherishing even as the
[1:45:59] lord the
[1:46:01] spiritual for we are a member of his
[1:46:04] body remember
[1:46:05] of his flesh and of his bones for this
[1:46:09] course shall men leave his father mother
[1:46:11] and shall be joined unto his wife and
[1:46:13] the two shall be what
[1:46:15] this is a great mystery but i speak
[1:46:19] concerning who and the water
[1:46:23] makes sense now nevertheless let every
[1:46:26] one of you in particular
[1:46:28] so love his he goes back again down
[1:46:32] even as himself and when the wife
[1:46:35] see that she happens her work
[1:46:40] let's go to first corinthians back and i
[1:46:43] finished
[1:46:46] where was i that was verse two
[1:46:49] verse three but i would have you
[1:46:52] that your that the head of every man
[1:46:56] is who and the head of every woman is
[1:46:59] who
[1:47:00] and the head of christ is who we
[1:47:02] understand the two are one
[1:47:04] every man praying oh prophesying
[1:47:08] now we're getting to where we're going
[1:47:11] having his head covered
[1:47:15] dishonor his head who is the head of a
[1:47:19] man
[1:47:21] what does mean head cover does it mean
[1:47:24] putting a hat
[1:47:30] hold on i'm i'm maneuvering to the
[1:47:33] airport
[1:47:35] does it mean having the head cut job to
[1:47:37] verse 14
[1:47:38] then we're going to stop somewhere so
[1:47:40] you hang on to that
[1:47:43] does not even nature itself
[1:47:46] teach you that if any man have water
[1:47:51] so that covering is not a hat
[1:47:55] it is the only one
[1:47:59] that was permitted was a nazarite
[1:48:02] man not the woman
[1:48:06] amen does not even naturally self
[1:48:09] teach you that if a man have long hair
[1:48:13] it is a shame to him
[1:48:17] dishonor but if a woman
[1:48:21] has long hair it is a water
[1:48:26] a glory to her for her hair
[1:48:29] is giving her for a water so long
[1:48:32] hair for a woman is a
[1:48:35] covering by the scripture
[1:48:39] go back again and then we finish
[1:48:42] verse four every man praying
[1:48:45] or prophet saying having his head
[1:48:48] covered in other words having long hair
[1:48:52] makes sense now dishonor
[1:48:55] christ makes sense make sense
[1:49:00] but every woman that prays
[1:49:04] or prophesy with her head
[1:49:07] uncovered
[1:49:11] what is the covering of a woman it's
[1:49:13] water
[1:49:15] if her if her head is uncovered
[1:49:18] what does he mean
[1:49:22] it is now now you're giving me the
[1:49:24] answer yourself
[1:49:25] gender is what cut right
[1:49:30] clear but every woman that prays
[1:49:33] or prophesy her head uncovered dishonor
[1:49:37] her what
[1:49:38] who is the head of the woman the husband
[1:49:42] and if we go back in the bread who is
[1:49:44] the head of the bride
[1:49:46] do you see the two quotes i gave you at
[1:49:48] the beginning
[1:49:49] now it makes sense why brother branham
[1:49:51] say when you do that
[1:49:53] you are double sinning when a woman
[1:49:57] committed
[1:49:57] adultery she's double sinning
[1:50:01] she's first sinning against her
[1:50:04] that's why when that woman committed
[1:50:06] adultery
[1:50:07] and confessed to god she keeps suffering
[1:50:10] suffering until she get to brother
[1:50:12] branham and brother branham said you
[1:50:14] committed adultery she said i
[1:50:16] already asked forgiveness what random
[1:50:18] say you didn't sin to god you said to
[1:50:20] your
[1:50:21] go first corrected with y'all then you
[1:50:24] go back to who
[1:50:26] when you cut your hair you are
[1:50:28] disrespecting
[1:50:29] both your husband
[1:50:33] you okay and then you disrespecting god
[1:50:36] as a member of the bride and you also
[1:50:39] disrespecting your messenger of the age
[1:50:42] and you also disrespecting your local
[1:50:45] pastor
[1:50:48] who want to cut her hair again
[1:50:53] you're going to find god with four sins
[1:50:55] right there
[1:50:58] let me go back again but every woman
[1:51:01] that prays or prophesy with her head
[1:51:03] uncovered cut dishonor her head
[1:51:07] for that is even all one
[1:51:10] as if she wear in other words a woman
[1:51:15] that have hair that looks cut
[1:51:18] is the same as a woman that does not
[1:51:22] have
[1:51:22] hair at all when you go
[1:51:25] to captivity to war
[1:51:29] when you fight and you see a woman and
[1:51:32] that woman is a virgin
[1:51:34] if you want to get her to a wife tell
[1:51:37] her
[1:51:38] to cut her nail because israelite don't
[1:51:41] keep long nails
[1:51:44] they don't put a clear coat to play
[1:51:46] around with the devil
[1:51:49] young sister it's a law it's a hmong
[1:51:51] young sister full of them
[1:51:53] clear coat and make their hair their
[1:51:56] nail go this way and the second thing
[1:52:00] shave ahead which is the same as a what
[1:52:07] the style of cutting her hair cutting
[1:52:10] hair
[1:52:11] is a hidden star the style of trimming
[1:52:15] of having long nails
[1:52:16] it's a hedonism they're hidden
[1:52:20] cut their hair they're hidden
[1:52:23] have long nails they hid them paint
[1:52:26] their face
[1:52:27] they hid them paint their eyes remember
[1:52:29] a holy boy in ezekiel 23
[1:52:33] and god wants you to separate from all
[1:52:36] of that
[1:52:39] that's why brother branham said not even
[1:52:40] a caesar
[1:52:42] should be closed getting into your hair
[1:52:45] because you're breaking the nazarite
[1:52:47] valve
[1:52:48] you're breaking it it's the covering
[1:52:50] that covering is not what the
[1:52:52] pentecostal went and put
[1:52:54] a covering on a woman saying a covering
[1:52:56] it's a hair
[1:52:58] you are reflecting the glory and you're
[1:53:00] going to see why did sarah
[1:53:02] call abraham my lord
[1:53:06] because of this i will show it to you
[1:53:08] but time is gone
[1:53:10] let's stand father
[1:53:13] father father daddy
[1:53:17] when they say the head of the home
[1:53:20] it doesn't mean that you did chief
[1:53:26] not what it means
[1:53:29] let me help you on that i have to give
[1:53:31] it to you
[1:53:33] i have to give it to you
[1:53:39] hallelujah
[1:53:44] let me see where it is
[1:53:52] hallelujah
[1:53:55] go to verse seven
[1:53:58] for a man indeed ought not to cover his
[1:54:02] head
[1:54:03] you don't need long hair for as much as
[1:54:06] he is the what
[1:54:10] can you read it as much as he is what
[1:54:13] the image and the water and the glory of
[1:54:17] god
[1:54:18] are you an image and the glory of god in
[1:54:20] your home
[1:54:24] daddy daddy online husband
[1:54:27] are you the image of god and the glory
[1:54:31] of god
[1:54:32] in your home because the reason why they
[1:54:35] told you
[1:54:36] cut your hair because you are reflecting
[1:54:38] god
[1:54:39] so you should be god to your home your
[1:54:42] wife should
[1:54:43] see god in you amen
[1:54:47] your children must look at daddy and see
[1:54:49] god
[1:54:51] if they don't have any idea what is god
[1:54:53] they can look at you and know exactly
[1:54:55] what a christian should be
[1:54:57] because you should be you you are
[1:54:59] already built to reflect
[1:55:01] the glory of of god as a man
[1:55:05] because the scripture will say later
[1:55:07] that the woman will reflect the glory
[1:55:09] of the man not of god as a bread you're
[1:55:13] going to reflect
[1:55:14] the glory of christ but as a married
[1:55:17] woman you're going to reflect
[1:55:19] the glory of your husband that's why
[1:55:21] brother bradham said
[1:55:22] show me the woman that a man want to
[1:55:25] marry i will tell you the spirit that is
[1:55:27] in that man
[1:55:29] amen people can watch your wife and know
[1:55:32] what kind of men you are if your wife is
[1:55:35] always just
[1:55:36] scared like this something is wrong at
[1:55:38] home
[1:55:40] you see a wife joyful she's fun there's
[1:55:43] something that happened at home that
[1:55:44] make her like that
[1:55:47] you see a wife wearing tight dresses
[1:55:52] amen short clothes and all kind of stuff
[1:55:56] check sometime it is not the wife
[1:56:00] somebody have a demon and when they show
[1:56:03] him he say i don't see anything wrong
[1:56:04] with my wife
[1:56:05] i don't see anything wrong with my wife
[1:56:07] he can't go outside he's controlling
[1:56:09] himself by laws
[1:56:11] and he's trying to transform his wife to
[1:56:14] to be
[1:56:14] conformed to the image of those women
[1:56:17] out there
[1:56:17] to please his folly his passion
[1:56:22] and it won't work still tomorrow fight
[1:56:25] tomorrow fight tomorrow fight
[1:56:26] it is not it is the man the wife is just
[1:56:29] a reflection

[1:57:33] that every heart be so open and humble
[1:57:37] in front of your word to receive
[1:57:40] exactly that which was given because
[1:57:43] that's the bomb
[1:57:44] that you sent to this age to heal your
[1:57:47] children
[1:57:48] father may we take this word and go home
[1:57:51] go on our job and continue to meditate
[1:57:54] if in our life we are really reflecting
[1:57:58] you as a bride of jesus christ
[1:58:01] father many things were done in
[1:58:03] ignorance
[1:58:04] because the people were not taught they
[1:58:07] thought it was just an opinion
[1:58:09] that somebody can do whatever they want
[1:58:12] and even ministers
[1:58:13] came to the place to some of them begin
[1:58:16] to say we are not in the days of brother
[1:58:18] branham
[1:58:19] like the word of god have ages but this
[1:58:22] word
[1:58:23] was an eternal word that will continue
[1:58:25] to remain
[1:58:26] eternal and true because when you spoke
[1:58:29] you see it all the time
[1:58:31] and you spoke and you knew that what you
[1:58:33] gave will
[1:58:34] automatically fit in through eternity
[1:58:37] father may you be merciful to this
[1:58:40] church
[1:58:40] and may you be merciful to each one of
[1:58:42] our life that we remember that wherever
[1:58:45] we going
[1:58:46] we are nazarite we are part of the
[1:58:49] brother
[1:58:50] we are part of this woman we become
[1:58:52] king's woman lord father
[1:58:54] part of this broad to reflect the crust
[1:58:57] in our character
[1:58:58] in our way in our talking in everything
[1:59:01] that we do
[1:59:02] so that people can see living oracle
