engagement at hand which will involve Great danger and suffering and deprivation amen so when God say not he's just telling you there is a danger coming up that's God language when he say he sleepeth he's telling you the person is died he's dead amen and brother Bram continues and he says now he does not say it in a blunt curd manner tribulation is coming that would frighten one but like a mother who about to turn out the light say gently to her child lest he be frightened now don't be afraid for the light will go out and it will be dark but remember that I am here with you so he says don't be

Wayne is with us here you know brother Wayne pretty good I know him since the old church in marida Street and amen and the first time I saw him he preached and that was the first preacher for me that

that the Lord amen would uh say something to be a blessing to you today and amen it's in our heart Amen to be a blessing to the Bride of Jesus Christ what I believe to be the most precious thing that there is is the believer is the Bride of Jesus Christ and sometimes we think about the powerful blessing of the blood of Jesus and the prophet said if we had a charger of it how we would care for it and what we would think about it he said but you know he said God gave that blood to purchase you so there's a purchased product setting here this morning of the blood of Jesus Christ that he deemed you valuable amen for that blood I want to say God bless you and brother Steven thank you for the invitation and to the saints of God uh online this morning God bless you amen and we've been we've been in a little bit of a meeting up at brother Shawn Martin's for the last couple days so uh we we've certainly uh been experiencing a blessing there and we trust God's going to just give us something here this morning amen and uh we want to turn into the Bibles Amen to the Book of Romans the 10th chapter um I'm uh bringing you greetings from Brother Ericson and the church there true word Tabernacle in bluon Ohio amen and uh Brother Ray says please give the Brethren our greetings amen we're we're with you in heart amen and uh I want to read from here Romans the 10th chapter and the 13th verse for whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved how then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard and how shall they hear without a preacher and how shall they preach except they be sent as it is written how beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace and bring Good Tidings Glad Tidings of good things but they have not all obeyed the gospel for Isaiah saith Lord who hath believed our report so then Faith cometh can you say it with me Faith cometh Faith come Faith cometh by hearing and by the hearing of the word of God Amen let's just bow our hearts this morning Heavenly Father we're certainly honored to be with your children amen but father it is written in your sacred scripture that wherever two or three are gathered in your name that you would be in the midst of them and Lord we most welcome you this morning we welcome you in the songs Lord in the worship we welcome you in the ministry Lord father before uh the people of God lord them that are present them that are listening father I I openly confess my need of you I openly confess that without you we are nothing Lord Lord and that we have nothing of our own but father we thank you for the word that you've placed in our heart and we openly confess our need for you to come on the scene this morning Lord and to ignite the heart and the children of God and and Lord to bring Faith into their lives I I ask you this morning for a divine presence Lord I ask you that you would be the voice that's behind the voice that you would be the grace that would move in this meeting today Lord you would convict hearts Lord father that you would heal bodies Lord that you would set Ablaze The Souls of the children of God father we never joined ourselves here together just for some Creeds or just to hear a man speak but we've come together to invite the presence of the allmighty god the one that can change the situations of home life and families the the one that can change our bodies the one that can change our hearts and Minds oh God we invite you to the platform this morning Lord Lord as you have promised Lord that you would hear us if we would humble our hearts and pray and Lord we come before thee this morning inviting you now in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen and amen and God bless you as you could be seated this morning uh I want to speak to you just a little bit today on this subject and um here from The Book of Romans and I I I would if I would take a title I want to uh speak to to you about this amen it's time to accept your Liberty it's time to accept your Liberty do you know there is nothing this morning that I can preach to you of Redemptive rights is nothing that I can preach to you that is not already paid for do you know there's nothing that I could say to you this morning and promise uh whether it be healing or salvation or Deliverance uh everything that God has to offer is already been paid for by the blood of Jesus Christ a prophet will teach us that he died at Calvary and he paid the Supreme price all the Redemptive blessings that he died for at Calvary is already paid for before God the debt is fully paid and you're excused before God you've been taken out of the pawn shop that's right the only thing you have to do is accept it in faith and Christ and walk out of the pawn shop that's all do you know that everything that God has done and is going to do has already been done for you and the only thing left is for you to accept it by faith do you know there's nothing here this morning amen that God can do he's already done it he done it that day at Calvary so the only thing that can happen at this point in our Christian experiences is that God would send a word and that word would ignite a faith and by faith you would begin to believe that my body is healed that my life is saved and that my sin debts have been paid and when you get your faith high enough amen there is the baptism of the Holy Ghost that will settle upon the word of God that has already been confirmed in the age amen the Holy Ghost amen it's not something amen that just comes the Holy Ghost is something that comes upon the word of God in your belief in a finished work at Calvary if Jesus Christ was wearing my suit this morning he would have to say it's finished 2,000 years ago he announced it from calvary's Cross amen it is finished amen the sin that is paid amen amen the life amen of Jesus Christ was offered that your sicknesses are healed that sins curs has been destroyed the Spells have been broken everything the devil has against you has already been broken are you hearing me church it's finished uh the word of God has announced it he announced it from calvary's Cross and how could he come this morning and say anything else brother let me tell you it's not coming it's already here and if our faith can reach out this morning the angels of God are here the power of God is here the Dynamics of the Holy Ghost is here it's right here in the building this morning behold I stand at the door and knock and if any man will open up his heart I will come in unto [Music] him and this is not something that's on its way it's something that is here and if we're not a part of it then that means we need to open up our hearts right now and say God I'm aware of your divine presence and this this this world that I'm living in amen cannot recognize amen but there's something about the inspiration of the Bride of Jesus Christ that's been released in this hour and a prophet said this he said what you ought to do is you ought to pray until you know my inspiration until you feel the inspiration that he is present the scripture tells us that Christ is present right now he is the omnipresent God right now if there's anything that is declaring to you that he's not here that it's a lie it's contrary to the word of God Amen I know right now that the angels of God are here they're encamped about them that fear the lord the presence of God is here it's in the building right now let the inspiration fall on the church that can say he's here I declare amen by Divine Vindication that the god that can change lives the god that can change Hearts is right here in the building this [Applause] morning I'm talking about something with power I'm not talking about some little mansy pansy something somebody come up with in their mind I'm not talking about a watered down gospel I'm talking about a straight laac power from the old High that come into the Church of the Living God well there's some men that's not scared to qualify the word in the age you're living in that they're ready to vindicate the word of God and the time that they're living in do you know this is a beautiful time to live do you know this is the best time there is to live do you know nobody ever lived in a time like you're living right now do you know the Bible declares the holy prophets declare that there has never been a day like this day there has never been a time like this time there ain't never anybody set in the seat you're set an in there nobody ever heard the power of the Gospel the way you have people like to fantasize and they like to say well back in the days of this guy and back in the days of this guy and there ain't nobody ever amen don't you under underestimate or diminish the experience that God has given you by looking at another age and wishing this age was like that age but there's never been another people on the planet come on Church you know what I'm telling you is the truth the Bible said that your name is written in the Lamb's Book of Life from before the foundation of the world so there's millions of people in that book amen there's millions of people in that book amen from the beginning of time every redeemed of God is in that book but you are the first church you are the first people that actually knows that your name is in there while you're living everybody else found about when they died amen but while you're yet alive God is requiring you to see your name in the Lamb's Book of Life we should ignite a Revival like nobody's ever saw this not going to be a worldwide Revival because it's not meant to the world but to them that have their name in the Book of Life they're going to hear our voices in heaven they're going to hear our voices on the earth and everything there in is going to hear I John say Amen that the lamb is worthy to take away the sins of the world you're going to hear me say You're going to hear this bride singing a different song brother we're not crying about the sins of yesterday we're not crying about the days going by amen there's been a change we've seen the book open up and I heard myself begin to say the lamb is worthy and we shall and we shall and we shall rain on this Earth You got to see those little changes in scripture you got to pick them up Revelations the first chapter said the time is at hand didn't it say that amen and and when he's writing Revelations 1 John begins to say that the lamb has washed the church Loos the church in his own blood is that right it said he loosed it in his own blood and he shall rain on the earth Revelations 1 and he shall reign on the earth the blood of the Lamb has loosed you and the lamb shall rain on the Earth but in Revelation chapter 5 John saw it from a different view after the book was open and he realized the blood was for him he then begin to say we shall reign it's not just Jesus shall reign but we shall reign do you recognize as the Bride of Jesus Christ you're just as spotless as the Lamb of of God God is not looking at you he's looking at the lamb God is not looking at you he's looking at the power of the lamb and if you would quit looking at you and start looking at the lamb your faith would get into a place that you could say under this mountain be thou moved your faith will begin to reach to a place and every disease and every devil and every Power will be subject to the church hey I don't know about you but I wore my dancing shoes this morning amen the power of God is still Justice real this morning as it ever [Applause] was listen the days of former religion is behind us amen the days of just some intellectual something is behind us this is a bride's anointing it's a bride's Jubilee it's a bride Revival [Applause] oh this message ain't calm down this message ain't lost its power amen amen this message is as powerful as it's ever [Applause] been to them that are drawn to it it's still the greatest drawing power it's still the greatest anointing to them that are ordained to it they still realize that it's the resurrection of God do you know God sets a Time God actually sets times he's a timekeeper God's a he sets a time and he's never late to an appointment he's never missed an appointment you might think he's late but he ain't it took him four days to get to Lazarus grave but little did we know he was writing prophecy amen that in the fourth day in the time of restoration that the light would come in the evening time and a resurrection would bring Lazarus out of the Grave by voice not the whole grave one man not the whole Cemetery one man but Jesus knew his name and when he called his name he called a Revival in the middle of a leard Dean cemetery and do you know God still has the same power to call a Revival in the middle of this Leia in the middle of a dead dark denominational world the light of Jesus Christ has returned to the Earth in the form of a pillar of fire and I believe this morning we can salute the return of Jesus Christ in the form of the pillar of fire and he's here to lead a bride back to every Redemptive right every blessing that God has given the [Applause] church I feel like flying I feel like walking in another dimension amen this is a dimension changing message this is an anointing that comes from another world this is not a Pentecostal anointing this is not a lay de seal anointing this is a bride anointing it's a seven seal anointing it's a seven Thunder anointing it's the power of God that will change every life and every [Applause] heart if you don't think it's powerful just let it in your heart just let it in your [Applause] life why you well go ahead and praise him this is your hour to do it yeah God said sometimes and the wheels of Prophecy keep the timing of God do you know you got to work within the limits of what God sets the time and season he sets it God's word is just as true in any age but then there comes a season that that word is to be fulfilled you you go back you go back and watch Moses's life every one of us in here knows Moses was born the prophet he was the seed amen of the deliverer of Israel that had been prophesied over Abraham that I should deliver thee with a mighty hand and after 400 years God had lazed up a man that was ordained to lead them out but watch God do something for you and me show the failure of human intellect and the training of humanism because Moses had been trained 40 years by the greatest men that live by the greatest education amen and God showed us that education even will make a profit fail if he leans up it amen look Moses failed leaning on education and went and killed one man and God run him out in the desert he lived out in the desert 40 years to figure out that Moses ain't going to be the one that delivers the children of Israel amen Pharaoh is not going to be the one that delivers the children of Israel God is said I will deliver them with a mighty hand I'm going to do this work Moses I just need to borrow your body I don't need your mind I don't need your understanding I need your Humanity amen because God had to get into a man amen to lay a platform you you all know the story and you know that Moses spent 40 years in that desert till he seen that light do you know Moses had beg to forget about the promise of Deliverance Moses had beg to forget that God had made those kind of promises you know why he forgot it because in his humanism he tried it and it didn't work do you know there's been a many people that have tried out the power of God in their human intellect and they go read about it and they come out and try it and if it fails all of a sudden Something's Wrong With God all of a sudden something's wrong with a message something's wrong with God Amen and what it is is a man gets in his flesh and decides he wants something to happen and if it don't happen then there's got to be something wrong amen but if we would surrender our beings unto the god of Abraham to everything there is a time and to everything there is a season amen I do nothing until I see it with my father but when the father sends the vision there is a liberty Amen to manifest every promise now now you know now you know amen you know that the prophet said five minutes in the presence of that burning bush give Moses more than all the schools of Egypt five minutes in the presence of that burning bush what did it do it ignited the ordination of his life and it gave him what he was lacking what did the pillar of fire give to Moses it gave him a revelation of the will of God in the season that God was going to do it you see what it did it imparted to him a direct Revelation that this is the time this is the season of it do you see what the bride Church did back throughout the church ages do you see what they did Mark 11's been laying this Bible all throughout from from the time of Jesus until today and men have tried that and they've tried that and they tried that until they got people believing that it was just a mountain of sin it's just a mountain of this it's it's just a mountain of that that's all all the Mount of Olives means but when Jesus said if you say on this mountain he's pointing at a mountain he wasn't pointing at an imagination or a spirit he was pointing at a mountain and when he said to the Fig Tree I curse you it was an actual tree that the left the thing because the authority of the spoken word was being imparted to the Church of the Living God and everybody thought that it was in the season of those disciples but do you recognize that God will make a promise to one man and fulfill it to another come on now you you know I'm telling you the truth when God called Abraham he said I'll give you the land I'm going to give you the land you know the book of Acts says that Abraham never even stepped in that land he never possessed that land Abraham never possessed the land that God said but God called Abraham but it wasn't until under Joshua that the children of Israel possessed the land that God gave them through a promise to Abraham are you hearing me that Thessalonian church amen he raised them up and said I'll show you a mystery that the Lord shall descend from heaven with a shout and a voice and a trump but they never ever possessed that but in the last days under the ministry of the Holy Ghost God would call a church together and say now is the season now is the [Music] time come on the Corinthian Church heard it you shall take on incorruption and put off this corruption and put off this mortality they never did it they never did it and had they tried it would have been a carnal impersonation but when the pillar of fire returns it brings the season and the direct revelation of the will of God to fulfill the word in its season are you hearing me then there's a season then there's a time in the Book of Daniel did not God tell Daniel to shut up the book until didn't he use those words until didn't he say you got to shut up this Revelation cuz they can't have this until what in the world was God waiting for what was he waiting for a prophet said he was waiting for somebody that could comprehend it he was waiting for somebody that could understand it are you are you hearing what I'm saying that the the church in its infancy could not accept these things but God was saying there's coming a bride a bride speaks of maturity you don't marry a little girl you wait till she's mature and she can have children and God chose a bride in the age of maturity and Paul called it the age of adoption amen that in the day that you're going to know you're going to know I wasn't the son of Charles and Elam I was the son of God and there's a revelation coming in this age of maturity that you got to know where you come from amen are you hearing me job where were you before the foundations of the world I know there a crazy world going on right now but to understand this you would have had to been there when God created the thing what did he say he well that predestination is a bunch of of milk that ain't what God called it he said job G your loins I'm going to talk to you like a man go to La I'm going to talk to you with some understanding you're going through some trials right now but I ordained you I got I got faith in you because in the season in the season of understanding in the season of adoption in the season of reality I'm going to let some stuff go and the people through education is going to miss it and Jesus said I thank thee father thou has hid can you imagine God would hide in a symbol and he would come unto you in the volume of a book that he would hide the symbol in the Book of Revelation and wait until a Prophet come to reveal it can I say this The Book of Revelations is actually your book that's not the Corinthian book or the Thessalonian book that's the Book of Revelation it is a love letter unto the Bride of Jesus Christ God didn't trust that book with just anybody amen you better put your seat belts on but God didn't trust that book with an angel he amen John said that was an angel that signified the writings of that book and brother Ram says it could only be a prophet but in revelation 22 guess what the Bible said don't you worship me John I'm one of your brothers I'm a prophet amen unseal this book for the time is at hand amen when is The Book of Revelations open in the age it's going to be fulfilled in that's right it's not fulfilling those other ages it's fulfilling the ages fulfill well you might as well go ahead and Shout it's your season so what are you actually talking about I'm talking about let let me let me just say this some of you girls sitting here maybe your boyfriend or your husband wants to get you a love letter and and he's going to send it amen and there's going to be 2,000 people read that letter before it gets to you but he got a secret message he wants to get to you he's got some love he wants to transfer to you but if he writes it in a symbol form no matter who carries that letter the true meaning will be did until until he sends a prophet to reveal the symbol come on you can take a CD I can hand you an MP3 and you can carry something on that and I don't care where you go nobody will know what's on it till you put it in a CD player it's recorded in a symbol but played back in reality and God recorded a letter to the Bride of Jesus Christ in a simol form but in the days of The Voice of the seventh angel God would reveal the symbol of this Bible back to the church hey come on Church the very interpreter of the word has come down in the form of a prophetic word to ignite you to deliver [Applause] you do you know God's interpret of his own word y'all know that right everybody don't want to believe the message they say that God's inter of his own word and yet they don't accept God's interpretation because God interprets his word by bringing it to pass Peter said we've not followed cutting devices of man's ideas and fables he said but I was on the Holy Mountain and I seen the cloud come down and I Heard a Voice say this is your beloved Son hear ye him and he said God is an interpreter of his own word let the day star rise in your heart Amen Let us more sure word of Prophecy word what's more sure than what Isaiah said Jesus a a virgin shall conceive Isaiah 7 a virgin shall conceive what's more sure than that Jesus he was more sure he was the living manifestation of what Isaiah said amen it's amazing to me the people that leave this message they say we don't preach the Bible but let me let me just give you a real reality right here this morning we're not just preaching about the Bible we are the Bible we're not just preaching about Malachi 4 we are Malachi 4 I'm not just preaching about first Thessalonians 4 I am first Thessalonians the 4th chapter and 1 Corinthians chapter 15 there's a name on the book in the time of the manifestation come on little lady come on you can't fail you can't fail not this Eve because she's not going to fall from the word because she is the word now I I I'm just a hillbilly I'm just a simple man and understand things in a simple way I had my little daughter Bethany she just a little bitty Ty she might have been one or two year old she was still wearing the diapers but she could scribble on a paper with crayons and me and her was at the house her mom was teaching school uh we had a little home school church school thing and she was helping out there and I was having to babysitter well I was still studying and and I had a a CD brother Donnie Reagan was was singing some song I don't remember what he was singing now but Bethany enjoyed it my little daughter some of you know or maybe and she was out there in the floor dancing in her little diaper man she was she was cutting up she was enjoying that music and I'm sitting there studying and I'm studying second Peter the first chapter God's interpreter of his own word and in a minute she goes over and she starts writing and she comes over and hands me this letter and she says to me here Daddy and I take this letter in my hand and it's just got a bunch of scribbling and stuff on it so I lay it down I say that's real nice honey here and she she looked at him me she looked at me and she said no Daddy it's for you and I said well thank you that's really nice and I hand it back to her she said do you do you know what it means daddy well let me let me just say this to you there is not a college in the world that could train you to read what that letter said there is not a school on this planet to tell you what that letter meant do you know the only person in the earth that knew what that letter meant was the girl that wrote it and she said Daddy it means I love you all that scribbling me I love you I said glory be to God we've got a Bible and it's full of symbols but when you're finished what it means is I love you I love you Pride God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son I'm not here guessing about what it means y'all might think I'm excited but I'm not really excited you ain't never even seen me excited but you wait till we get up in heaven and you see a guy go bouncing by and dancing in the spirit and you'll say oh there goes brother Wayne I tell you what we're going to teach the Angels how to dance they never know what it is to dance the dance of redemption they don't know what it is to be lost and be saved but I know what it feels like to be in the depths of depression and the depths of sin and God who is rich in Mercy come to my [Music] life and Shook Me by the message of the hour what does all this mean I love you he loves me unlovable me but see there's a season well here will love the unlovable you're not even Israel by seed you are Israel by Grace you are the Seed of Abraham connected to the Covenant of Abraham only by Grace it's only way you got in you just got hi by Grace Daniel said there's a time appointed do you know Daniel saw the same thing John saw Daniel 12 and Revelations 10 compare them compare them one time sit down and read them next to one another you got somebody standing up fighting for the people book open you it's a it's a it's a beautiful comparison but both Daniel and John had to seal up the book one says until the time of the end the other says until the voice of the seventh angel so both of them had a key point the voice of the seventh angel would be an end time voice that's why the Bible said he was the seventh angel then he would be the seventh star that's in the Book of Revelations in the hand of God in other words when God timed out Gentiles he didn't put you on weeks months dates and years he actually put you under Stars we don't keep Time by calendar we keep Time by star now let me explain that to you he said unto Daniel back there in Babylon and he said I give unto your people 70 years and he actually could tell them the number of or 70 weeks sorry he could actually tell them the number of weeks from the time of end until the time of the temple they could they could have it down to the day according to the calendar but when God called you he called you in watches of Seven Ages and put Seven Stars to announce those ages that's why the times amen will break up and and you'll see a time a little while you'll see another time you need amen but the star is the one that announces the season it has nothing to do with a calendar it has everything of which star you're under right now in the book that was written to the rest of the world a star they don't even know what it means but to them that's had an interpreter Christ himself has opened that book to us that a star in the right hand was a messenger of God that was sent in a certain season to reflect his light to the church that was in that age that's why God called him man like William brandom because he can become a reflector and not an educator he can become a reflector of the power of God upon your life and he would from that star would announce the season of the Church of the Living God now you know I I could pull this from a lot of places in 1 Corinthians 13 He said hey he said you pray Perfection would come where there's prophecy that's in part where there's gifts are in part when when he that which is perfect is come why is that in the age of perfect love in First Corinthians watch Paul writes about love and then he talks about imperfection because Perfection is the Capstone which is divine love and there is nothing else in the pyramid that God says he is God never said I'm faith God never said I'm virtue God never said I'm Temperance he said I'm love so in the age when Christ comes there's a Clarity that you will be known as you have you will know as you have been known right Romans 8 chapter said the whole earth groans until until you can grown all you want to but till God gets ready to open the season it will never happen until God manifests his word it'll never come didn't matter what Moses was didn't matter what Moses tried but when the moment of approval came God sent a light and ignited a faith so the Gentiles have a season in John the 12th chapter it was Gentiles that went to the disciples to see Jesus do you know that's the way people see Jesus today it's through a servant that's exactly scriptural now they went to Jesus they went to a servant to see Jesus do you know that those servants went to Jesus and Jesus sent back word and he said now unless a corn would go on the ground and die it abideth alone but if it would go in the ground and die it'll come forth and bring forth many so he's prophesying to the Gentiles it's not your season to see me but after I die and I'm buried I'm going to resurrect and the life that's in me that makes you want to see me is going to be manifested throughout an entire crop come on put one piece of corn in the ground and when that corn grows up and becomes a stock of corn and it starts bearing fruit you take one corn a cob and there might be a hundred kernels on that corn but you tell me which of them you put in the ground they're everyone identical they bear the same life they bear the same fruit they bear the same thing and Jesus said I amen am the vine and ye are the branch and the life of Christ is manifesting through the church come on no don't dis don't diminish who you are and what you're doing this is a gentile time as Jesus himself said in John the 14th chapter for in that day ye shall know that is a direct prophecy that ye shall know well what God is going to do to find out amen how are we going to know how are we going to have a sure Faith amen how are we going to know the day star would have to rise Vindicated word would have to come to the church for in that day you shall you shall know ain't that beautiful you're going to know amen isn't that what job come up with when job said though the skin worms would destroy my body I know I know what do you know job I know that my redeemer is alive and in that day there going to be a bride that's going to know Jesus is not in the Tomb Jesus is not in the grave and that's not just because we read about it but he has been here manifesting Divine [Applause] [Music] promises now we got we got to we got to realize God set some times in Genesis 21 Sarah conceived and be Abraham a son in his old age at the set time she didn't just get up and have a baby but God set a time for that baby amen do you know that time coincided with one who was named Elohim that when the Lord came to them and read the heart of Sarah it came at the same time time the time of Sarah's deliverance and her change coincided with the time that God visited the Earth in the flesh isn't it beautiful now look in Exodus the 9th chapter the Lord appointed a time and said tomorrow the Lord shall do this thing in your land amen am I too fast on the interpretting okay I'm sorry I I I I've been in a meeting and I should have gave you the notes huh I ain't using them anyhow so wouldn't have helped you in job the 14th chapter even the resurrection is set on time in Job chapter 14 the Bible said that would hide me in the grave that would keep me a secret until the Wrath be passed that thou would appoint me a set time isn't that beautiful it would appoint me a set time David sang the Psalms yes sir y'all love y y y'all y'all enjoy David y'all y'all know you you might not know this but I'll tell you why you like David I tell you why you like David's Psalms because David was singing most of the Psalms that he wrote sitting next to the Tabernacle of David the Tabernacle of David was a tent set up in the city of David which was on Mount Zion and he set that tent up and David sang those songs amen without the levitical order they had a levitical law set up in the temple I think it was in Shiloh at that moment and they had the law they had Moses's order down there but David had carried the ark out from under the law and had carried it to a tent and he was singing songs to God while he was in a tent under a daily sacrifice and it's written in the scripture when God got ready to come to the Gentiles amen they was getting on to the men for bringing the gospel to the Gentiles and they said is it not written that God would restore again the Tabernacles of David then the praise and the worship of David would return in the house of God and he would take a people a people for his name's sake that's you and me that's when David be listen listen when David begins to sing his Psalms the first song David ever sings He said oh I want to be like a tree that's planted by the water amen though it be withered amen it cannot disappear amen you cannot move it amen though though you cut it to a stump it'll come back again but whatever you do it will give forth its fruit in its season do you know Psalms the first chapter is actually a prophecy of you amen that David was singing about a tree amen that couldn't be destroyed amen the book of Acts tells us about a bride tree don't it but it's destroyed by the Roman bug it's destroyed by by cre Joel two said four things eat on it C pom worm canker caterpillar they all eat that tree but Joel actually goes on to say I shall restore and David said it'll have fruit in it season so God has to restore the bride to bring the fruit of Christ into the Church of the Living God come on we're going to go somewhere we're going to go somewhere amen they took down that tree in its prime the Roman Church took it down amen but when God said I will rest store there's a season that that tree is coming back to life and there is nothing that can keep it from manifesting this [Applause] fruit are you hearing me all the same bugs that eat it are still here all the same bugs that come against it are still here the difference is we still got our leaves we still got our bark we still got our life we still got our fellowship well I'm a bit of a hill belly I thought it pretty good cuz same bugs eating on the same tree but it ain't hurting at this time you know why it's fruit season God have appointed a time and nothing can prevent that from coming forth I lived in Arkansas most of my life my dad always had fruit trees they were they were plum trees and man he always wanted to Orchard the plum trees so he planted but we was in Northern Arkansas so every year the buds had come on that tree warm up a little bit early March or something the buds had come out man it would Bloom out man it was a promise of a great fruit coming but then about two weeks into his blooms or a week into his bloom a late Frost always hit and that late Frost would kill the bloom while it was yet on the tree but see this tree is a different tree this bride tree is a a supernatural tree and God has promised the fruit's going to show up amen it don't matter if the devil sends a late Frost it doesn't matter how cold loud to see it gets we've got our own light in the evening time it's shall be light amen what we are manifesting is not a worldly fruit our fruit is coming from another dimension and our light is coming from another dimension this is the church of the Living God uh Jesus said I shall build my church I'll raise up my tree and the Gates of Hell we'll never Prevail against it the devil can come against it with everything he's got but I got something to tell the devil you're too late we already have a rapturing faith we already believe the message of the hour who said preacher are you listening to all the things they're saying about the message actually I don't amen but they ain't got nothing to say to change my mind they ain't got nothing to add I've already got it I've already added to Faith knowledge I've already added to knowledge Temperance I am a sealed vessel it's a virgin wom of a virgin bride a The Whispers of Satan has no place in the Church of the Living God am I talking to a word bride she's a virgin born word bride of Jesus [Applause] Christ then what you're going to bring forth is already predestinated can I can I can I just say this to you you cannot fail you cannot fail this ain't about you this ain't about your ability this is about the promise of almighty [Music] [Applause] God David got done preaching about that tree and in Psalms the 2 chapter he started and he began to say that they have took counsel and they have decided Amen Let me just put it away in in in our language they have decided to stop the Prophecies of God read read and he said that's why the Heathen begin to rage they're raging at the prophecies that are being fulfilled amen but you know what David said he said God sits in his counsel and laughs God has not got some nerve pills wondering how all this is going to turn out God is Not anxious to figure out whether or not you're going to believe or whether you're going to be saved or whether you're going to be in a Rapture God prophesied in this Bible 2,000 years ago that there would be a bride without spot a wrinkle she would raise up out of denomination and be the first fruits of the Resurrection of the power of God as sure as there is a bridegroom that's going to be a bride and I believe she's sitting right here this [Applause] [Music] morning you don't understand the chords of Prophecy there's a chord wrapped around your life that is dragging you and pulling you into the resurrection it's dragging you into adoption messages it's pulling you it's a draw that you cannot resist it's an unresistable force that has broke out over your life no matter what you had planned no matter what you wanted to do something got a hold of you it's not a third pull it's a third and third push it's a third pull and God is pulling the church into every promise that he made that's then can I say this God wrapped God wrapped Court of Prophecy around the seed he put in you we say a little cler amen he he he put a TI poost on you and he wrapped you into the promise of God and you can't mess this one up I know that's a shock to the legalist mind if you don't listen to me you don't go the way I think you ain't never going to listen let me tell you something God ordained you and that's the reason you believe the way you believe it's not because you can explain everything it's because you were ordained to believe it that little woman at the well represents who you are she was actually a harlot but when she heard the voice of the word she said I perceive you are the Messiah because she was ordained to believe [Applause] it next somebody says why do you believe that message of Malachi 4 just simple answer I'm ordained to it you don't have to answer every question somebody's got you can just say I'm ordained to it I can't help somebody else don't see it because the Bible said they would look with eyes but they wouldn't see they would hear with ears and they wouldn't hear so you can sit and explain it to them all day and they're still not going to believe it but unto them that Happ been ordained amen it just takes one sweep of the anointing of God and some inside recognizes that's my God talking to [Applause] me oh my goodness y'all going to get me in trouble for [Applause] sure isn't it odd you can take a little child and raise it up in your home and you can teach it and it can look up in the heavens and say daddy where did the stars come from you say God created them and you can say they say where did the where' the Sun come from God created and it's little life that satisfies it because it just has simple faith that if God did it then I don't know how he did it but he did it and that's enough you take that same kid and put it in college and within a couple years those scientists will give that kid every question of every unbeliever that ever had and after a little while they begin to wonder who did put the sun who did put the Stars it was settled until some educator educated a question into you because it wasn't your question to be begin [Applause] with oh if they're going to publish it we might as well talk about it cuz there is some men left with a sword on their side who is ready to take the land that God gave them we are not pullbacks or cowards we are not somebody hunting a place to hide we are the children of the most high god with an adoption Authority upon our life we got a sword in our hand and a faith to will the thing [Applause] I don't have to answer a question I am a believer I was not put here to answer people's questions I was put here to believe the message of the [Applause] hour listen to me God sent William brandom and the Bible said there is a season of sending and there is a season of receiving and God sent William brandom that's over that's a finished work it's settled forever amen it was tried it was proved it was found to be of God well I might as well go ahead and preach brother Brandon put this message on trial years ago all over the south in in Tampa and he took a Congregation of people and said I'm going to make you the jury it wasn't some calone Johnny lately that's hiding behind the death of a prophet it was people that were living right at that season and they said that's the truth so can I give you a little bit of clarification here what people are trying today is not the message it's a trial of your faith it has nothing to do with the message the message is what it is it's what do you believe it is what do you believe about this message but there's some people that believes it's the Fulfillment of Malachi 4 of Luke 1730 of first Thessalonians you want to talk about the Bible we'll talk about it what about Revelations the first chapter with seven stars who are they what about Revelations 4 amen the Throne of God who is it what about Revelation 5 an elder with an open book what is it what about them Seven Seals what about Revelations 10 what about Revelations 9 what about Matthew 17 how about some more what about Malachi 4 what about what about Isaiah 14 what about Isaiah 7 [Music] I guess people want me to become blind but I already got sight I've already seen the [Applause] [Music] [Applause] word oh I feel something rising up in this building right now I feel something rising up that's coming from another place this is not coming from your from your neighborhoods this is not coming from your radio stations this is coming from another dimension almighty God has down into humanity and has ministered by the promise of a gift Faith back into the church for I shall restore sayith the Lord problems we got them conditions we got them but regardless of the conditions the church ain't fell apart the church ain't falling apart [Applause] it becomes smaller in the sixth chapter of [Music] John because unbelievers started walking away y'all say y'all talking about somebody no I'm talking about a spirit now think about this just a minute but Peter but Peter did not understand any more than the ones that were walking away but Peter had already seen something he had seen Vindication he said I believe that you're the Messiah I believe it see and when you start seeing something and you start believing well I mean we might as well preach amen because the Old Devil he just keeps throwing darts don't he he just keeps throwing darts but I tell you why amen that brother brandom he's out there and oh God help us he's out there and he's just plagiarizing he's plz and Lin he's prizing this he's prizing that well you know I I I just got a little something to say I'm one of the guys want to raise my hand and say hey wait a minute wait a minute hey ain't going minute here hey heyyy can I ask a question can I ask what where did L can get what he said on are you telling me Lin had all this inspiration but L and borrowed it from different men in the ages and he borrowed things from Paul and he borrow things from Isaiah and he borrowed things from Moses but he don't make a a point of telling every place he gets everything but there's some things that locken didn't have there's some things that locken didn't understand but God said in the last days I will send the seventh angel and he will tie together every you Sin from the time of Paul until the time of the church you said preacher what are you trying to say I'm not trying to fight I want to show you something there is a season to accept this there's a season to believe it and the devil's not fighting William brandom the devil's not fighting brother brandom he's fighting you brother Bram season is finished no matter what you think about him he did his job no matter how you feel about the message the message is the message you will not change the message and the devil's not trying to change the message he's trying to change [Applause] you woo but I'm already tied up I'm already tangled up I'm already baptized in the power of the Holy Ghost there's angels that are around me this morning energizing my faith to believe oh we got we got we got to get back to reality haven't we let's get back to reality there's got to be a season do you know that Mary was a virgin and maybe only 16 years old come on now but Isaiah years before she was born said a virgin shall conceive let me ask you something was that a changeable product it was a sealed word that God spoke through a man and it was meant for somebody's life it was meant for somebody and Mary was only a 16-year-old old girl walking by well one one day and the Bible said Gabriel come out and stood before her and said Mary thou H have found favor with God in other words the time for this Deliverance has come and you're the girl that's going to come through a virgin shall conce how many girls had heard that prophecy and it did not affect them how many girls had heard the words of Isaiah and it did not change them but this time it was an angel and it wasn't just talking to the crowd it was talking to an individual person and it was saying this is your season and this is a time of favor for God has favored you and you're going to be found with a child and his name is going to be called Jesus are you hearing me and she she put up this conditional question but I don't know any man he said don't worry about it can I paraphrase for you don't worry about it it's the season and God will overshadow his word that falls into you [Music] now that word had circled the Earth 700 years because when the word went out Isaiah said it cannot return void but it has to Circle until it be accomplished it can't go home without it the word cannot return to God without its attended purpose and Mary and Mary was the intended purpose of the word that that Isaiah spoke now when she conceived that seed she brought forth a child but you know what he said it was a season of her favor yes sir do you know that David the same writer we've been talking about also says of the church how many knows you're Mount Zion you are actually Mount Zion according to Psalms 102 the Bible said Thou shalt arise and have mercy upon Zion for the time of to favor her is come the time of favor for her has come do you know God had a time to favor Mount Zion do you know that when you're working in the plan of God you can find that time and that season and the position that you step in is in a position of favor it's a position of blessing it's a position of Liberty that's why the Bible says in Psalms 102 and when the Lord shall have built up Zion he shall appear in his Glory when you build her up from Faith to a Capstone then he'll appear in that church he will appear in that church he will manifest his glory right in the Church of the Living God according to Psalms 102 he will not he will actually regard he will actually regard the prayer of that destitute he will not despise their prayer for these things have been written these things have been written for the generation that shall come and the people that shall be created in the Lord now listen this this these things will come for a people that it has been written about a season when the word will manifest of who it's been written about a season of people who are created for praise do you know that God actually calls a seed a generation they Avid says it and he shall count the seed for a generation we can break into some heavy stuff I'm going to stay here all day but I I I just want to touch this little point if you go to Matthew the first chapter and you read you'll think that Matthew made some mistakes in the way he said things because Matthew starts introducing Jesus and remember he starts at Abraham the king Lon and he comes down through Abraham's kingly Lon and then he gets there and he said there 42 Generations from Abraham to Jesus and then he breaks up the 42 generations and 14s until he gets to the 42nd generation but if you take time to count them I'm sorry there's only 41 there there is not 42 amen between Abraham and Jesus because there is a 42nd generation somewhere there is another generation somewhere Abraham had another seed it's a royal Seed of Abraham amen a generation that shall be considered amen the generation of the Lord a g are you hearing me you're a part of the dissension of Jesus Christ just like RAB and Tamar was a part of his descension into the Earth and his Humanity the Bible says again he shall descend from heaven with a shout of voice and a trump the 42nd generation is the path of the dissension of the word of God in this age let's go to the Cross let's go to the Cross Psalms 22 let's go there what what's what does he actually say in Psalms David said who shall declare his generation you kill a man on the cross how's he going to have a child in Isaiah 53 he said prolong his days and declare his generation when you kill a man you killed his seed but in this case when they killed Jesus Christ they released his seed when they killed Jesus they released they released the bride that was on the inside and today just like Adam was separated from Eve and Eve come out of Adam amen so has there been a bride that has stepped out of the word of God and she is the Fulfillment of the word of the age she's living [Music] in a it's a season it's a season like never before what what does this anointing mean what does this anointing mean it means God's getting ready to do something sir yes sir yes sir when John got anointed he seen Jesus anointed the Bible said he bear record the spirit Came Upon Jesus and said this is my beloved Son in the Book of Luke the fourth chapter when Jesus come out of there he went straight to the Wilderness you know what the devil did if you be the son now if he questioned Jesus Christ being the Son of God you don't think he won't question you being a son you don't think he w't question you but he puts up his own rules to qualify you and if you don't meet his rules then you're unqualified ified to be what God said you are isn't that beautiful if thou be a Son cast yourself down bear you up but brother BR said watch he wouldn't make bread for the devil that's right that's right what did them deci what did them Pharisees say to Jesus come off the cross we'll believe you do something to prove who you are but Jesus didn't have to prove nothing to nobody he was who he was yes now notice in the Book of Luke Jesus picks up the scripture and turns the book of Isaiah and he found the place he actually looked for the scripture that talked about where he was living and he said the anointing has come on me not to cast myself down not to make bread not to make stones but to preach but to preach the acceptable year of the Lord [Music] y' y'all know what the acceptable year is right it was the [Music] Jubilee now I'm not a I'm not a theologian I just read my Bible but but I've read it a lot and I've looked a lot to find out and maybe our brother's a bit of a teacher maybe he could tell us but does anybody know where that the Jubilee trumpet was changed for preaching from the time time of Jesus all the way back to Moses yes sir the 50th year was announced by Rams Horn they would blow a Rams Horn and it would announce to the world the season of Jubilee had come but when Jesus walks in the popit he opens up the scripture and said the Lord has anointed me to preach the acceptable year I'm not going to blow a Ram's Horn but my words my Ministry will be a season of Jubilee to the Church of the Living God I'm talking to you about something right [Music] now you know what the Jubilee was right it was when Israel you know there was there was 12 there was 12 states of Israel that was the 12 sons of Jacob because God changed Jacob's name to Israel so Israel was a man and a nation samna was an age and the city so was Judah a state a tribe it was also a man and judah's children were to live in Judah amen a and Benjamin's children was to live in Benjamin in the tribe in the land and Joshua said you go there and you go there and you go there and the Lord and the Lord said I own the Earth and I own the Earth and I'm going to let you live on the land I've adorned you to live on anointed you to live on but if so happens that you sell it off as I know you're human nature you're going to get in a little trouble and you're going to sell this land off but I've give it unto you for an eternal inheritance and every 50 years no matter what debts against it no matter what is built up against that land I'm going to blow a trumpet at the same time that I make an atonement and the blood of the atonement will come to the children of Israel through the sound of a horn and people that never even see the blood will hear the sound of the trumpet and they will know that in that season it don't matter if we have been in the in the in the in the slavery amen for 25 years it don't matter if we owed $100,000 when we he when we hear the sound now here's the thing you should know that before you deal with Israel hallu you should know before you loan them money that God can just forgive them that's it just a little just a little blood and a sound and it's all over and you can run around saying they owe they ow they owe and God said I don't know what you're talking about now every 50 years the sound of that horn would go out into that land into every corner and whether you were actually up there and seeing the blood or not you would hear that sound and it would be a Ram's Horn and that Rams Horn would reach them and through that horn they would understand that was the moment a Ram's Horn does not make its own sound a Ram's Horn has to have somebody to blow through it just like a prophet is a mute the Rams Horn is a mute and until somebody picks it up and uses it it has no Authority or no power but the horn only has the authority of the one that's behind it and if it sounds in the 49th year it doesn't have the same meaning as when it sounds in the 50th year but in the 50th year if you heard the sound of somebody making a noise across the piece of horn it would mean we can return back to everything and here's the beautiful part is that in the days of Israel do you know they hired servants and servants stayed with the household they actually hired them they stayed with the house but but but if the if the house got sold off the sons and the servants left with the household so let's just say that you that you had a servant in your house and and you lost the house due to its uh damages and you you and your servants go work out in the field if I looked out in the field I wouldn't be able to tell the difference working side by side you look the same but when the but when the trumpet blew Jesus said the sun set you free you're free indeed and it's not the same to a servant as it is to a son but Unto the Sons of God the sound means that you are always a son that you always be a son and there's some people that'll hear the same message but it won't mean the same thing it's not the message it's who they are it's not it's nothing wrong with the trumpet it just matters whose ears it falls on if it falls on the servants they cannot return because they have no inheritance that if it's a Son of God and they hear the sound of the Jubilee they will have to return to everything because they have an inheritance oh come on Church of the Living God Jesus changed that from a horn to the preaching of the Gospel So today we're not standing at Calvary you're not seeing blood you're not seeing the cross but you're hearing a sound the sound of the gospel and through the blood it is saying you're free you're free from every denomination you're free from every idea you can go back to where you come [Applause] from a it's a time of [Music] Liberty I don't want to wear you out are we okay they picked that horn up and they blew across it it was then a wind instrument it took a breath and the breath would blow across and you would hear something now I want y'all to just think about this because do you know that Abraham actually had a name change yes sir and it was an H put into Abraham's name do you know it was the fifth letter and that in the fifth letter of the alphabet is actually grace and grace was being added to Abraham's name at the time the season of the change the season of when Christ manifested himself in mect and eloh him came right down there to him I tell you man sometimes it's hard to stay in this human body I was standing in Israel one day and I asked a rabbi a great and learned man he's Rabbi Rickman he's in the the modern uh Institute to rebuild all the temples and Things Great schooled man and I asked him I said now to you Israelites what's that H got to do with the thing what's that H matter he said well brother Lawson the only thing I can tell you is this he said see in English you pronounce Abraham he said but when we say it he said we have to actually breathe across the name to say it he said we say Abra how he said it cannot be pronounced without breath and when he would Breathe Out the name do you see what it was he would actually breathe he would Breathe upon Abraham the breath of Promise the breath of change the inspiration would come into his name I don't know if you're he he me but God has breathed from Heaven there's been a breath that has been released on the church and it changed our name from Pentecost to the bride it changed us but we're not just another church we're the blood wash Blood Bought baptized Holy Ghost Field Church of the Living God we have heard the sound of Jubilee we're ready to return to everything do you know it actually writes in Revelations the 10th chapter and when the seventh angel sounds his trumpet what's that actually mean then brother Bram said when you heard the gospel it meant this it meant you could throw down your hole and go home that's what it meant it meant it don't matter how long that you've been working for the devil you can just go home now you can just return to the Lord you know what that means that means if you was out working in the field and you heard that sound you could just lay it down and go home nobody had to come and teach a class on how to let go of a hole nobody had to come and give you a fivepoint psychology lesson of what it means to walk away from a sin debt but when you heard the sound if you were a son to begin with there was something in you that knew I've got a home place I've got a father I've got a lady oh come on you prodical son it's time to come back home the father has been waiting for the adoption time my God somebody the Lord is talking to somebody this morning that prodal left home but the father sat on the porch waiting till he got done eating that Pentecostal shuck waiting till he got done with the Hogs and he would rise up and say the food for the servants is even better than this in my father's house that's right so he was coming home but he was coming home with a servant attitude he was going to call home but he was just going to be a servant in his father's house I don't care what he done he'd never be a servant I don't care amen listen to me the only place you'll ever be a servant is in your mind the only place you'll ever be a servant is in your mind where you've let the devil talk you out amen of the grace that God put in your life but when that boy come over the hill and he got ready to come home his father had been sitting there waiting for that just one question how many people walked over that Hill how many people have walked over that hill and that father sat right there and never moved but when that boy who was his son started on his way home the father stood up and went out to meet him let me tell you something God Amen has come to meet the bride in the power of the adoption and tell you you are not just a servant you're a child of God you're a Son of God oh let Liberty come this morning amen quit letting the devil bombard your mind and tie you down to a bunch of ideas and unbelief let the power of God Break Every Chain release every bit of the bondage that the mind is under this [Applause] morning every time you go to raise up there's something that tries to bind you every time you get ready to really worship God there's some chain that's wrapped around your mind that says you did and you did and you did amen but there is a power in the house of God this morning to break every chain Amen to break every Power to break every bondage that's upon the [Applause] [Applause] church what am I talking [Applause] about I'm not going to slow down and read because I don't want to take the time but when you get home you read first Corinthians the third chapter and you see if Paul didn't say that the people had a veil on their heart that's right was Christ Christ yeah but they crucified him not because of him because of their eyes They Crucified him because they couldn't see but he was what he was right it was their standing and Paul said so their eyes are blinded and there's a veil upon their heart he said but when it shall be turned to the Lord when the heart is turned to the Lord he said then their eyes will open and they will see for the spirit of the Lord is Liberty the Lord is that spirit and where the spirit of the Lord is there's liberty that's not just Liberty to Rejoice that's not Liberty just to rejoice and just to praise that's a liberty to lay aside every lie the devil has put in your mind that's a liberty to say to the devil you held me in that life and abused me and now when I'm trying to be free you won't let me go a child of God will decide I'm going to love the Lord and I'm going to worship God and that lion devil will follow you to church and sit down beside you if he can't keep you from coming to the house of God he'll try to talk you out of it the whole time you're there he'll try to say well this ain't for you and amen look at that guy he just doing this and saying that he means this and he means that he's a liar to begin with that Devil's been lying to you your whole life amen but there's a sound of the Gospel of Jesus Christ that says you're free you're free to destroy every lie that the devil's put in your mind you can throw it down this morning you can just throw it down this morning and say I'm walking out of here free I am tired of the devil riding my back he's not getting another free ride for me yes come on church you've been packing complex around with you you've been packing that thing from church service to church service just waiting for somebody to say something so you can build up and be mad about it and let me tell you this morning there is a place amen that the power of God can break the complexes that's put in your life by the lies of the devil it keeps you from having friends oh yeah keeps you from having friends make you feel mistreated all the time he didn't even talk to me he didn't even shake my head man he didn't say this he didn't do that amen can can you imagine that my preacher what are you getting me into those things ride people and then they come to the house of God packing them on their back and they just pack it from one place to the other you know at some point you got to just let it go it go at some point you got to just make up your mind I'm just going to go on with the Lord I don't know who else is going but I'm going I don't know who else is going to be free but I'm going to be free I don't know who else is going to praise God but I'm going to praise God I don't know who else is here amen that's been ordained but I have been ordained I don't know who else is going to go in the Rapture but brother I'm going into the Rapture oh that's right if a bunch of Pentecostals can Shout amen with their makeup and bobbed hair amen and their big earrings what ought the Church of the Living God be doing in this season amen it's your season to praise him it's your season to worship it's your season of Freedom if you ever wanted to worship God this is your hour if you ever really wanted to just dance in the spirit this is your hour if you ever wanted to preach the gospel this is your hour

eagle and I feel the Winds of the rapturing faith breathing across my life this [Applause] morning I feel something rising up in this building the faith of the Living God has swept down and is carrying you into a realm every devil is defeated every spirit of God and the devil has been defeated in this building the spirit of God has been [Applause] released yes sir put me in the place where Mary could conceive put me in the place where where Joshua could say son be still put me in the place amen where the rivers could be parted where the Dead Sea can back up [Applause] [Music] where are

that my what an hour what a season can our musicians come this morning what a time to live for God now it means something brother Bram said the sound of that trumpet means the devil is finished that's what it means it means the devil is finished would it be something this morning if you just look around and say Satan you're finished then you would be saying what Jesus said from the cross and he that heareth my words is that what he said he that heareth my voice John 5:24 now how do you know the voice you're hearing is coming from God how do you know there's been an abstract on this voice that's right and if you run an abstract on the house you know what you can do you can tell me from the time of its origin who's owned it who's had debts on it where it's went and who now owns it and from the time that the voice left Jesus Christ I can tell you where it's been because a prophet stood in this age and said when Jesus spoke it he transferred it and it went to Paul and it went to Iranians and it come right up through this age until it stood in the seventh age and when a prophet was leaving just as he was walking out the door he said now you're the final voice this is finality
