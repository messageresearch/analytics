sing i want to sing oh i want to see him because i want to see him okay i don't know if i sang this recently i sing it a lot because it's one of my favorites but let's sing it as i journey through the land singing as i go pointing souls to calvary to that crimson flow many arrows piss my soul from without within but my lord leads me on yes through him i must win and oh i want to see him look upon that face there to sing forever of his saving grace on the streets of glory let me let my voice his all pass home at last ever to rejoice now winning service for my lord dark may be the night but i'll fling more close to him he will give me light satan's stance may fix my soul turn my thoughts aside but my lord goes ahead he leads but every time and on the streets of glory let me lift my voice my chairs all pass home and last ever to rejoice now when before me billows rise from the mighty deep then my lord god breaks my park he does safely and he leads me gently on through this world below [Music] [Music] on the streets of glory let me oh i want to see him look upon his face and bear to sing forever i'll be saving grace on the streets of glory let me lift my voice here's how fast home and laughs ever to rejoice hallelujah hallelujah can y'all imagine on the streets of glory just let me lift my voice we'll be shouting care's all gone i want to sing one more i got a little something i want to tell y'all that i heard yesterday but let's sing this right here as well there is none like you no one else can touch my heart like you do [Music] there is none like you one more time hallelujah [Music] there is not like you sweet jesus [Music] no one else can touch my heart like you do [Music] and i [Music] there is none like you [Music] i could search for all eternity love and find there is none like you hallelujah hollywood there is truly none like you lord hallelujah y'all can um y'all could be seated just for a second i don't have any uh praise requests or praise reports or or prayer requests this morning um so let me get let me give you this little testimony i i saw something yesterday i guess he was a college he was a college man like a phd or something but he was explaining about uh the hebrew language and he said that they used just consonants and you should know that they said if you know the hebrew language you know it well enough to interject the correct vowel in the word so he was speaking of the word yahweh and how you know the bible just got it as four letters but he did call it the the great creator's name so he said that it's one of the only words in language that you don't you really don't use your tongue with so i started and then he he went on to explain he said the word yahweh expresses breath i hope this microphone will do it because he's spoken to his and he said when you breathe in and then you breathe out okay it says the word yahweh the great creator let's see if i don't know that it'll do it i haven't tried it this morning but you can do it you know and you can think about it so let's see so he said the first word that you said when you were born was the name of the great creator he said the last word that you'll say on the way out is the name of yahweh man he said he was sitting in a room of phds and he said you could hear the tears falling with these with these other people he said now here's what here's what struck me there's no catholic way to breathe there's no hindu way to breathe there's no muslim way to breathe so everyone says yahweh they acknowledge our god yahweh when they take a breath isn't that awesome amen does anybody have a praise report that they would like to share this morning yes ma'am i don't i don't know if you remember in october my truck was driving just shut off kia wind up paying for the full engine i got it back in november and i gave that testimony well this is march and we were coming back last week from philadelphia on sunday and my engine light came back on my husband says your engine light is on i said oh i just want to give the truck back so i took the the calder mechanic he told us you know take your truck up to autozone get the report the diagnostic came back that it was the catalytic converter and a gasket called kia my truck has two catalytic converters and some other pieces that i don't know i go on google waiting on key to call me back one part on sale right now seventeen hundred dollars i said lord have mercy but i started praying and researching i said lord you had this happen for a reason and i left it just like that all as well so the lord's been dealing with me as he's been having pastor say about my temper and traffic and driving my husband says leave on time or leave before time so i took the lord at his word on wednesday and i was obedient i was okay lord i give it to you thursday is when all of this started happening kia the guy the manager kia calls me back and he says unfortunately your truck is over the mallets to be covered under warranty so well your website it says 10 years 100 000 miles my car's under 100 well i'm sorry when you brought it in it was 4 000 miles over i said oh lord i said okay he said but i'm gonna he said we fixed your engine in november i said yes he said sometimes these engines can cause you to have bad catalytic converters let me see if they'll help you with some of the cross i said okay i begin just got off the phone with him started praying lord you'll work it out he calls me back at 1 30 and he said he said are you feeling lucky i said well just tell me he says um he is going to pay for it cost labor all parts repair and i just started giving god the glory on the phone you know sometimes people in the world they don't know how to take that but i know what god is doing for me internally he's cleaning me up so i can go home and these are just fruit so i have to give him glory amen glory it's a work in progress isn't it it is it is with me amen anybody got a

wine and milk milk is for babies paul spoke about milk stay on the top say oh nettle don't dig it amen i know what is there without money and without water so there is no money there is no price it's priceless we love it everybody loves this one amen wherefore do you spend verse 2 money for that which is not bread you labor for that which satisfies not harken diligently to me and eat you that which is good not the material thing and let your soul delight itself in water so this food is a soul food hey marquis incline your ear and come to me here and your soul not the body he's not talking about the body and the unders and your soul shall leave and i will make an everlasting covenant if you notice he says that when you get there your soul shall live so what happened to the first soul leave it alone amen your soul shall leave and i will make after your soul is leaving and i will make an everlasting covenant with you even the sure mercies of david you remember that from the hotel speaking about the resurrection amen once your soul is redeemed then what is following is the sure mercies redemption first part redemption second part number five number five you remember the grace that come to save you up and the other grace that is coming to do something else amen the temple of solomon is right there but i'm trying to stay away and to stay with this one somebody even temper and ask me but stephen what do you think about the new name i'm like please don't even start it that's a deep subject but lord's willing we will talk about the new name of jesus christ one day and you will see what is that name please can you tell me no let's go to matthew 25 i just mentioned about marriage in luther before you know it somebody was banging please please can you explain what you were saying on wednesday please hold off matthew 25 we have one service so don't put pressure on me before we give you two services chill out you only have one verse 1 if you're there you can say amen then shall the kingdom of heaven stay on surface it's loaded be likened to 10 virgins which took their lamps and went forth to meet the bad the bridegroom all these women are virgins brother brother say virgin means holy which means sanctify we're not in sanctification yet but all of them are sanctified amen but despite their sanctification five of them were wise and five foolish in the sanctified state wise and foolish they that were foolish took their lamp and took no oil with them those lamps were not empty all the lamps of the ten virgins all of them their lamps have owned everybody here and they were all virgins hey right here you will think this oil will make them meet the bridegroom this is deadly what is all this the holy ghost oh god so they have the holy ghost why they didn't meet the bridegroom you need to be very careful i hope the whole church is here amen some of you are still struggling with gas i don't know okay but the wives took oil in their vessels with their water so the foolish have oil but not the second oil there is two oil am i reading a different bubble there is a first oil and there is a second oil amen the first soul will make you go until a certain spot and you can even slumber and sleep oh god five why the bridegroom terry he delayed they all slumbered and did water with the old everybody okay verse six and at the midnight amen there was a cry stay on the surface made behold the bridegroom cometh go you out to do water everybody virgin everybody have a lamp everybody have oil the only difference there was another set of oil that could not be revealed only after the midnight cry there was a first container the first container i'm just there there is like a flame there there is a container there is a lamp right there and there is a flame right there amen in this lamp we got oil that's your first soil you keep it sanctified jesus is coming jesus is coming jesus is coming amen but there was another oil that was in a different container amen only the foolish kept it at all and they didn't use that oil until in other words could not be unloaded until the midnight cry is it okay amen it takes the midnight cry to activate this oil amen hallelujah my god then all verse seven all the virgins arose and trim their lamp they start cleaning their lives amen and the foolish say to the wise givers of your oil they were not looking at this oil here they already have it amen they found out that when the midnight cry came what they had was no longer enough to meet the bridegroom they needed the second set of oil to be opened that oil only opened after the midnight cry the first oil could prepare you to wait for the bridegroom but you can slumber remember peter have faith you remember you remember peter have faith but his faith could fail and jesus saw them he said when you are converted when you get the second one over there no more game you're going to meet the bridegroom hallelujah brother kelly got it verse eight and the foolish say to the wise givers of your oil for our lamp are gone out how can you have an oil and that lamb begin to go out you need a second set of oil this second set of oil will make you meet the blood group that's a different yet it's oil but it's just on a different container amen verse nine but the wise answered saying not so lest there be not enough for us and you so that oil is customized for one person it's a quantity that belongs to one person you will see even the measurement of roof down the road amen hallelujah but go you rather to them that cell you need to go back again go search for it because the midnight cry is saying that the husband is here we got to move on now it's your time to go back again and to start all over again amen to them they sell and buy for yourself and while they want to buy they realize they're in trouble when they go to fix their lives amen while they went to buy the bridegroom came back here the one who saw the bridegroom was the one that had the oil on the sec in the second container not the first one all of them missed it while the bridegroom came and they they were ready so to be ready was what this is now ready amen while they were ready they went in with him to the water you see now you see now to the marriage and the door was water shut after came also the other virgin saying lord lord there is a key here why while they're calling him lord open to us but he answer and say verily i say unto you i know you not watch therefore for you no need of the day nor the hour wearing the son of man cometh in other words in our language there is no solution here it's a mathematical language everybody okay so this oil is the only oil that puts you into the rupture anybody here but the first oil you can still remain virgin but it's going to put you through the tribulation before you come up everybody okay let's go to luke chapter 14 blessed be the name of the lord isaiah free salvation you don't have to do anything jesus paid it all on calvary praise the lord hallelujah thank you jesus free amen let's look at look oh mother robert got it again luke 14 verse 25 if you dare you can say amen and there went small multitude with him so when jesus was going there was a lot of people following him wow all of them love jesus christ all of them would like to stay with jesus christ a wonderful manti the entire world love jesus christ and there went great melted with him [Music] and he turned and say to them so jesus turned and looked and he saw a big church huge church many thousands multitude means thousands of people you will think christ will turn around and say father thank you for the children you given me what a wonderful biggest church i work a lot now the building is big jesus turn around and look at that audience that are following him they're not following the devil they're following jesus christ what did he say he says if any man come to me you guys are following me let me make sure you understand naomi and opry ruth slow down young girls you want to go where i'm going let me make sure you understand if any man come to me and hate not if you keep looking at me i'm going to hide because you got it on your bible hate not his brother see when i was looking for a scripture like this my father is always on me and the father are trembling what stephen what are you trying to say and hate not his father so do we need to hate our fathers and head not his father karma and mother oh my goodness not my mama karma and wife oh sweetie you also you gone from me and children oh my god i love my children and brethren he is such a wonderful brother and sister such a lovely sister yea and his own life so what do we need to love [Music] hate everybody hate myself too commit suicide that's not it that's not what he's saying he cannot be my disciple salvation free but there is a higher price to pay should we hate our families that's not what i'm saying let's continue verse 27 and whosoever does not bear his cross so he goes not only with a price it's going with a cross amen and does not bear his cross and come after me cannot be my disciple you all are following me let me tighten you up pretty good and tell you that when you follow me this is what you got to do and this is what you got to do verse 28 for which of you intending to build a tower sit not down first and count the water so jesus is showing you there is a cost amen whether he have sufficients to finish it lest happily after he had laid the water what is foundation by the robert can you say it loud what is foundation i don't want you to follow me if you have not examined what you're getting into it does it make sense lest you start like judah and don't finish the house that you started make sure you evaluate but stephen the gospel is good it's free yes it's more than you think amen less happily after he had laid the foundation and he's not able to finish it so laying the foundation is not too much the end the problem is to finish what you started amen the end amen and finish it all that behold it begin to do water look at them when they started brother brandon i'm safe what random say long they look at them now they start wearing pants oh they start putting makeup like ass you see now they start putting hearing now they say them their own message have trouble you started you didn't know where you finishing now the people will mock you you think you being cool the denomination will mock you when you try to imitate them when you're wearing dresses like them when you come with tight dresses they look they say you see they were like lose lose look at her now and when they see you they say yes this is the way you need to dress and they turn around and say branamite you didn't know what you were getting into saying verse 30 this man began to build and was not able to finish it or what king going to make war against another king sit not down first and consult whether he be able with ten thousand to meet him that comes against him with twenty thousand let's stay on the surface or else while the other is yet a great way off he sends an ambassador and desire conditions of peace or an ambassador amen verse 33 so likewise there is two parables there whosoever whosoever he be of you that forsake not what that he has amen he cannot be my disciple forsaking your father forsaking your mother forsaking your wife forsaking your husband forsaking your children and forsaking yourself but the proper language here they say hate let me quieten your nerve a little bit down matthew 10. the bible says you okay now he the lovely father or mother more than me that's what they hate me not for you to go hate your father everybody here but do not put daddy before god do not put your wife before god god say do this mama your wife is in the back giving command and you can't stand upon the word of god you're just obeying the command of your wife you're in trouble everybody here god said go to church your husband say stay home if that husband is before god you're gonna find yourself in hell he the lover father i'm just helping you now so take the heads a different way that love a father or mother more than me he's not worthy of me he the love of son or daughter more than me now it makes sense he's not worthy of me and he that take care not his what you understand the scripture now and follow after me is not worthy of me and he defunded for his life that word means save shall lose it and he that loses his life shall fund it for my sexual it so there is a price for you to love everything even yourself more less than god you gotta forsake everything there is a price there is a cross yet it's free let's pray heavenly father lord we are approaching you again humbly father this morning thanking you for your grace your love your mercy and for everything you have been doing for us father starting a week and finishing it it's not a habit it is lord a grace because many people started this week with us and were not even able to finish it lord but by your grace and your mercy you have preserved us in the midst of pandemic in the midst of everything that is going careless father you even given us the desire to come into your house father when the weather is so bad when it's very cold outside but lord father you gave us the strength and the ability to come into your presence lord if there is anything that we have done that grief the holy spirit may you forgive us father may nothing hinder the work of your spirit this morning we commit ourselves unto the hand be the alpha and the omega the beginning and the ending of this service as we're expecting and looking unto thee the author and the finisher of our faith we humbly ask it in the name of jesus christ amen god richly bless you we are tonight today on the fourth phase of roof we're talking about the baptism if i can get there on the four phases of roof we found out that roof departed from moab everybody okay when he departed from moab he was going into the land of judah and going into the land of judah we found out that roof met a certain point on his life which was a very critical point because at that point roof have to take a decision everybody okay and we took the point of that place which is the road going to judah and we found out that when we took that place and we converted that place into the tabernacle language everybody okay that place in the tabernacle language was called the other court everybody okay the bible have conversions everybody okay the bible have a language the bible is written in numbers it's written in science it's written in many different things and all those sounds all the numbers all the furniture everything that is going on in the bible have a message behind it everybody okay i can tell you grace that's a language you can open it in the bible it's there it's grace but when i take grace and i convert grace into a numerical language of the bible that grace becomes firm everybody here so when i say five and i say creation i'm saying the same thing it's only a different language everybody correct just like you convert the celsius degree into fahrenheit degree everybody here the temperature outside does not change if it's called in celsius it is also called in fahrenheit ever here but the language is only different everybody here so far so there is a conversion or a language in the bible there is a mathematics that goes in the bible everybody here if you don't learn that mathematic you're going to get in trouble everybody and only a prophet can afford that mathematics how many heard about quadratic equation how many heard about it have you heard about something that is called delta have you heard about it when delta is positive there is two answers there is like x1 and x2 have you read about it when delta is equal to 0 x1 equal to x2 do you remember that and then when delta is negative there is no solution do you remember that do you remember that this thing also goes in the scripture everybody here they are scripture that have a compound meaning [Applause] when i say justification sanctification baptism of the holy ghost here i can say it like luther wesley and pentecost i can say it like roof deciding roof surfing and roof resting everybody here and sometimes that language might be saying the same thing ever here it is the mathematic of the scripture and sometimes you can plug in something and there is no solution they ask jesus christ one time when are you coming and jesus said i don't know nobody knows only the father because there is no human solution it is locked by the father delta is negative are we okay so when we're talking about roof at the place of decision before you distract somebody when we talk about roof in the place of decision when you convert the place of decision it means roof in the other court everybody cares so far and we found out in the other court we have the brazen altar and we have also the lever everybody okay we explained to you in detail the brazen altar amen then we found out later on that israel was in trouble israel was taken away from god into idolatry by jezebel everybody okay when israel was completely on the idolatry the faith of israel was completely gone then god sent a prophet by the name of elijah everybody and the reason why elijah came elijah came to restore the faith of israel that was completely lost and we found out that when elijah came instead of elijah bringing israel to talk to them elijah begin to repair the altar when elijah repaired the altar elijah also took water and put there anybody when you take these symbols here and you convert that symbol into the tabernacle elijah was bringing the other court to israel the door because water is the gate here ever here so when somebody is completely away from god you must know what to bring to that person not the seventh seal not the feast of the trumpet you must bring unto him the other court first everybody okay because the altar was speaking about the brazen altar and then the lever the water was speaking about the level everybody care and later on elijah prey and the fire came on anybody care then we have repent when you converted toward the book of acts be baptized in the name of jesus christ and back here and you shall receive the water when you converted in the book of acts he goes to act 238 so you're moving from elijah to the tabernacle from the tabernacle to the book of art the conversion of the bible is perfect and you need a prophet everybody okay so far now if you look right here we have repentance everybody okay then we have the baptism repentance at the present altar everybody okay and the baptism at the level and we found out that the third element was fire everybody care when we went into the tub and i called the tabernacle have three parts everybody okay we found out that the brazen altar and the level was speaking about the other court right here that's your one embark here ever here your two also was right here repent and be baptized everybody okay then your tree goes into the holy place but there is a space here that is missing everybody okay elijah rebuilt the altar in reference to the present altar elijah put water in reference to the level the fire of god not a human fire a divine fire that consumed everything came from god in reference to the pillar of fire in the holiest but where is the other court right here although the holy place right here we still see that there is a place that is missing here the holy place i want you to keep this pretty good because down the road you need it ever here if you go to the book of uh first king you'll find out that before the fire fell elijah prayed and in the prayer of elijah it's only two verses elijah said that and it came to pass at the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice you know what it means that elijah the prophet came near near what he came near the altar the altar that was combined with the level elijah approaches the altar everybody okay and what is the larger deed that at this altar because remember the publican you remember and the pharisee both of them went for prayer in the temple and we found out that they were in the other court everybody okay now when elijah came near to the altar he said lord god of e of abraham of isaac and of who he didn't say jacob let it be known this day that the art god in israel and that i am the servant everybody okay and that i have done all these things at that water so everything elijah was doing was according to the word of god everybody here the foundation of god must be based according to the word of god everybody okay so far he did it not with his intellect he did it not with what somebody else said but he did it according to the vision that god gave to him and that vision matches perfectly the tabernacle everybody okay so far and when he did it according to the word if you will notice here when elijah approaches the altar elijah begin to pray anybody here he say hear me o lord hear me that these people may know that they are to the lord god and that are and that has turned their heart back again so between everybody between the brazen altar and the level and they're coming down of fire ever here there was a space of time of prayer and that prayer before the altar let's go to the book of second chronicles hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord second chronicle chapter six i was looking for this scripture i just put touch my bible i did it and i fell so i knew what the boss was telling me amen ii chronicle chapter six solomon came and built the table there the temple he finished the temple and this is the day of the dedication and solomon is coming in the temple what is solomon doing in the temple if you're there you can say amen second chronicle chapter six everybody okay let's go to verse 10. the lord therefore solomon came and begin to speak he said the lord therefore has performed his word that he has spoken for i am reason up in the room of david my father and i am set on the throne of israel as the lord promised ever here and have built the house for the name of the lord of israel everybody here and in it in the house the temple heaven put the ark yes wherein is the covenant of the lord that he made with the children of israel watch carefully now you there and he stood before the water so the prayer of solomon in the tavern in the temple was before the present altar remember when they were burning the sacrifice it was also prayer going on so solomon rose went straight ahead and approaches the president and begin to pray and elijah also at the time of the evening sacrifice approaches the present altar and begin to pray everybody okay verse 12 and he stood before the altar of the lord in the presence of all the congregation of israel and did water do you see a son to pray a way to pray amen everybody spread forth his hand for solomon has made a water a what it's a brazen altar everybody clear now a present scaffold of five cubits long and five cubit broad you see those number you see the grace remember in the tabernacle five five cubic broad and three qubit water do you remember the president in the temple in the tabernacle it was five five five and three because it was grace coming everywhere and then when you come to digress he perfects you by the sacrifice bring you unto perfection look at where ceremony is why is solomon praying at the present altar hey and had set it in the midst of the water so solomon was doing everything that was in the tabernacle and reproduce it there so solomon right here is at the other coat yes before the president alter everybody okay and upon it he stood and kneeled down everybody okay you see why you knew he kneeled down upon his knees both of them before all the congregation of israel and spread forth his hand toward water you can see a man kneeling down and praying before the congregation but he's praying where he's praying in the other court anybody here everybody here now when he begin to pray his prayer is longer let's keep the prayer and let's see what happened when after he finishes praying let's go to verse chapter seven the next chapter everybody there if you're there you can say amen chapter seven now when solomon had made water a nand of water everybody here so all the time between the coming down between the holiest and the other coat there is always a space of time everybody okay and that space of time is what prayer brother stephen how can i move from one spot into the next part anybody here how am i gonna move from the other court into the holiest everybody okay when he finished to pray let's go to verse one now when solomon had made an end of praying come out the water am i reading a different bible let me come here make sure am i reading a different bible am i reading a different bible what did elijah do and when he prayed what happened x1 equals x2 delta is equal to zero everybody okay the mathematic of the bible you there the fire came down from where the fire of elijah came from where the fire came down from heaven and consumed the water when the fire of elijah came down he consumed also what lord i have done all of this according to your everybody here and confirm and consume the burn offering and the sacrifice and the water deed water so they're coming down of the fire was bringing the glory of god remember in the day of pentecost it was the holy ghost and fire the fire and the glory are coming together everybody okay verse two and the priest could not enter into the house of the lord because the glory of the lord had filled the lord's house and when all the children of israel saw how the fire came down and the glory of the lord upon the house they did water do you remember in elijah they cried they bowed themself with their face to the ground upon the pavement and worshiped and praised the lord saying for he is for his mercy endure for what so we can find out that even with solomon he approaches the present altar and when he begin to pray something happened elijah had a space of time for prayer what is wrong with prayer everybody okay we find repentance baptism it's the other court we found the fire is the holiest but we found between the outer coat and the hole yes there is a space of time for what prayer everybody okay but when you go into the tabernacle inside the holy place we have true furniture towards the south we have the candlestick and then you have the table of the showbread but in before the veil here there was something another altar that was called the altar of water which was representing water [Music] everybody here so prayer activate the holy place are you following me this is a tabernacle language [Music] are you with me let's go to luke chapter one relax because i can't go 75 miles in this one let's go to luke chapter one oh my god at the opening of the seventh seal the bible became a new so now you understand the seventh seal is not a book that anybody can read even the people that hate brother branham the seventh seal is something else if you catch the seventh hill then you will see the bible is always opening like this yes the shields the shields they see you better know what the seals is you will be blaspheming let's go to luke chapter one you there you know the story zechariah stay on the surface there is a lot of stuff loaded stay on the surface everybody okay verse eight and it came to pass that while he executed or performed the priest office before god in the order of his course this is zechariah he was of the course of ebay which was the eighth course leave it alone everybody okay verse nine according to the custom of the priest office his lot was to burn water the father of john the baptist when he went into the temple of the lord everybody okay you have not caught it yet now you're going to catch it verse 10 and the whole multitude of the water where are the people in the other court or in the holy place in the holy place only the priest entered there and the high priest alone the congregation stayed on there outside where the pharisee and the publican was ever here so everybody is on the outside of the other court before the president and zechariah the priest enter into the water holy place so there is a sacrifice burning outside and the people are praying but on the same time the sacrifice is burning outside something is activated in the holy place everybody okay verse 10 and the whole multitude of the people were doing water outside at the time of water so when you are praying here outside on the inside the altar of jesus is activated everybody okay when elijah is praying at the evening sacrifice elijah knew that when they were burning the evening sacrifice there is a priest inside there that is also burning the incense everybody here so between the other coat and the holiest there is a space of time that always involve prayer and prayer is an element that is also seen in the holy place what are you trying to say brother stephen so when zechariah is there an angel appeared to him [Music] what is going on brother stephen the bible says in luke chapter 11 if he then being evil brother robert got it again know how to go with good gift unto your water how much more shall your water give the water holy spirit to them that do what everybody okay elijah built the altar but elijah have to ask for the fire to come down when solomon asked the fire came down the holy ghost is given to them they ask him [Music] you need a prayer life [Music] everybody okay at five and we are his witnesses of these things and so is also the holy ghost comer whom god has given to them that the water so according to the scripture not only do you ask but you must do what i have done everything according to your word now i am asking jesus taught the disciple on act one he said being assembled together with them he commanded them that they should not depart from water but do what they have to obey to wait wait for the water the promise of the father which he said you have heard of me they have to wait for the holy ghost and that wedding must be with obedience so what we think is when they went in the upper room they sat down like this the bible said in verse 14 they all continue with one accord in water so their wedding was combined with prayer the disciples were justified the disciples were already sanctified but before the holy ghost came they have to obey jesus christ and not only obey but stay in an atmosphere of prayer everybody okay prayer and supplication with the women and marry the mother of jesus and with his water between the other coat and the holiest you must go to a time of prayer everybody okay so we found act 2 38 here and when we go back in the tabernacle and we begin to convert this in the tabernacle we find out that we have the level we have the present altar the first part the second part repent be baptized in the name of jesus christ and you shall ever hear you understand now receive the gift of the holy ghost or justification sanctification baptism of the holy spirit roof deciding hoof serving roof water roof coming into the tabernacle we are in justification we talked about the present altar we're trying to get into the level so we can move on everybody okay when roof approaches the president roof says that naomi said that sister-in-law is going back onto her people unto her god returned that after that sister-in-law we talked about it and ruth said entreat me not to leave them or to return from following after thee for without that ghost hour ago in judah where the lord yes i would love in bethlehem that people the jews shall be my people and that god shall be my god not our god where that dies the death i will die whether buried the burial i will be buried and the burial speak of the resurrection and there and the lord do so to me and more also if ought by death part d and me when she saw that she was steadfastly minded she was very decided sincerely to go with her then she left speaking unto her so naomi could not let anybody follow her if she's not sure you made up your mind everybody here because naomi was holding a secret of the light of the lineage of the messiah do you know that and limerick was of the image of jesus christ and that lineage you have to be kept a certain way pure so before you can hop into that energy you must make proof of what you have ever care so she was in protection of that lineage she has to make sure you are stripped completely out of your family of your friend of your country you must be able to pay the price [Music] what are you talking about brother stephen amen the bible uh brother branham say coming to god is not an easy thing you swallow that you see people let the out there but one of them said 30 000 tomorrow coming to god is not an easy thing as you would think you will be as people try to make it to you oh well go gone just anyway john the church that is a story of god that is a story of the devil it's a great price to pay your salvation is free it's already paid for everybody but there is a cost that goes with that salvation on your part we play with the altar salvation is free that's right but you got a lot to get with your first abraham get deep behind your father that's why jesus said if you want to follow me you okay now and you don't hate your father in other words you must love your father less than me you must be willing if i'm telling you move you gotta move you must be willing like roof to leave her father leave her mother leave her brother leave her sister and go into a land roof doesn't know roof must be able to forsake everything she grew up in moab she went to school in moab she had friend in mohammed she have neighbor in mohammed she had family in moab but ruth have to be willing to forsake her in order to follow that road brother branham say wherefore come out from among them and be separate say the lord and touch not the unclean thing and i will not just receive you like that you got to separate from something everybody here and i will be a worker once god receives you he becomes a father to you keep that in mind i will be a father unto you and you shall be my son and daughter if you're a man son if you're a woman daughter because he's your father keep that in mind say the lord almighty there is a price to pay for those government and that is the price of water you must be willing to cut off certain things some of you don't want to let go that facebook you don't want to let go that youtube you don't want to let go that instagram and you still want to follow jesus christ you don't want to cut off with your friend your friend is worldly there is no good influence with your friend they always take you away from the message and you still want to keep them you thought you gonna convert to them it has been five years they don't want to come to your church they don't need your religion they don't want to be converted why do you fool around them oh no they're good people the good people they're better than some of the message believer there is a price to pay you must die to the things that brought you in this thing how did you come in the message what brought you in the message you were born as a child you gotta die to that relationship you came because of a husband die to that that death is going to separate you from your father and mother time because god doesn't have grandchildren you're cutting off with daddy and mommy and you hooking yourself to god but you still love your mommy and daddy you must die to the thing that brought you you pentecostal people to where you are this afternoon you gotta die to it samson was willing to pay the price to get the power of god back in his life again i wonder if the church is this afternoon willing to pay the price and die with the enemy they think all your popularity your friends that love you on facebook ever here and all this and that the other just to see the power of god back on you again and become a prisoner of jesus christ everybody here now they think of it is the people are now willing to pay the price to get back to that i believe that god just remained the same as he ever was but they think of it is the people has got so wound up into the world and the world in them till they just got enough religion to make them miserable not enough to really turn loose to god and give your whole heart to him but enough yeah i go to church certainly i enjoy good singing and clapping hand yeah i love that see it is more than that ever here ever here the trouble of it is the church today is not like samsung they are not willing to pay the price samsung prayed right when he prayed lord let me die with the enemy he know he was going to cost him something that's why david said i will not sacrifice unto my lord something that doesn't cost me ever here he knows he was going to cost something it's going to cost you something it's going to cost me something your social prestige your place and position in the denomination lord let me die then i see your purpose he know he was going to cost him something you must be ready to die out to your enemy to get the blessings of god samson was willing to pay the price to get the power of god again upon him he was willing to do it are you are you willing to sacrifice your water you want to sacrifice that netflix are you you know it used to be wrong for us to go to the movie but now the devil put one over you brought it right in your water now you have it on your cell phone are you willing to die to that married sister are you willing to die to that [Music] hallelujah hallelujah why is it because the price you pay has a consequence everybody here the price you praying and the president will open the door for you or lock the door for you there is a power of decision there is a time of decision and there is a result of decision whatever you do in this altar if if it was not done with sincerity your progression is hindered brother branham says this we know that this is justification this is sanctification this is the baptism of the holy ghost brother branham says this he said and the life that was in the stock went yes and one went to make the other are you following me i'm following you whatever you start here everybody here we'll open the next stage justification made way you okay now for sanctification and sanctification make way for the baptism of the holy ghost and the baptism of the holy ghost make way so whatever you start here is very important if this step is wrong it's going to block everything down the road if these things are not taught that's why we bring people at the altar they go and tomorrow they fall they go and tomorrow they fall and they don't understand why they can't have the victory whatever started here was not genuine but here because naomi made sure that roof before you continue with me i must make sure you are stripped completely and roofs say by confession i am denouncing my country i am dismissing my people i'm denouncing my family i'm denouncing everything that i hold dear oh in all my life since i was born till now all of them i left them on i'm going to a different land your god will be my god your people will be my people in other words the wolf have changed citizenship amen open roof chapter 2 roof come after the judges hallelujah let's go to ruth chapter 2. if you dare you can say amen for those who worry about time i'm good because some of you take 10 20 minutes i'm full and you take three hours of netflix you're not hungry have you seen kids watching tv four hours they keep watching watching watch and they don't want to stop you stop them they go back again cannot watch anybody here roof chapter two and naomi roof already took a decision she's moving and naomi had the kinsmen of her husbands a marry man of wealth did ruth knew about this man of the family of who elimelech the lineage of jesus christ go to matthew 1 you're going to see it and his name was boaz everybody okay and roof there more by test say to naomi let me go to the field stay on the surface who told the roof to go to the field did somebody tell them who said to who normally who should have told somebody naomi knows the law of israel naomi should be the one saying roof get up how are you doing fix yourself this is a new country welcome to america when you come here there is a way we behave we are widows god have provided something and according to the word of god you need to rise up and go after the the reapers over there and go there and follow them and get food that's what naomi was supposed to do anybody care but naomi never done that why because the decision of ruth gave her a citizenship outside of the natural blood are you following me a normal jew that was born jew by blood must know the law by the jew that is born by spiritual that bloodline is under melchizedek everybody here nobody will teach them anything but all will know me say the scripture jesus said in that day paul said no one will teach one another because the father is seeking for true worship not in jerusalem not in samaria those that are going to worship him in spirit and in what and paul expanded he said it will come of a time that all of us will be taught of god you won't call your friend that say come and teach us about the lord because all of us will know god it is not a priest telling you but it's a different bloodline and that blood instructs you what to do nobody told the roof but the decision roof took here everybody changed the roof into a different citizenship and when she changed ruth he activated the royal blood of jesus christ everybody okay and the wrong blood of jesus christ get the automatic give in your life he make you do things you don't understand why [Music] everybody okay and one day you will find that it was written in the bible but you didn't know he was in the bible when you were doing those things everybody here everybody clear everybody here one time my my wife took my child isaac it was a baby everybody go beautiful baby beautiful baby beautiful baby beautiful she went i don't know until the week or whatever appointment and someone look and say you know what if you want we can take a picture of your baby and we can put on the diapers and you're going to be paid money and everything for lifetime every time they use it for lifetime my wife came and told me that i said no i could be a millionaire but this time right and most of you some of you would have jumped into it brother stephen it's just a picture of a baby i want to get money the root of all evil when it happened i was not a dentist because you will say that you are a dentist that's why you didn't mean money i was not a dentist yet my wife is there so it was a very good opportunity for me to make money passive income and unpaid every time the diaper has been sold in america i say no everybody okay one day i was reading brother branham and i fell into a court brother branham spoke about the brother that they call to use a picture of his daughter to put in a diaper or something like that and the brother got very upset he said that was an insult for her brother for for for his own child i didn't know they court when i say that but i come to find out later on what i was doing was according to the message of the hour when your beginning is good it's going to transfer you into melchizedek and when merchandise take off your life nobody told the roof you need to go over there it was roof telling naomi that hey it's over there in the morning i'm gonna go over there naomi probably look he say this woman is something i told her to stay over there she doesn't want to stay i don't know why she learned these laws here who told the roof you need to go after the reaper because the law of moses already put it there roof did not know the law ruth did it like by instinct what activated the spiritual instinct is the genuine decision that you took here everybody okay so far if this alter is genuine if you give your life to god genuine and you mean really business melchizedek will take you over [Music] anybody okay but if still you still doing it because you want to do it but you want to hold certain things in your life are you doing it to please your father so daddy will see that now my child is is a good child and everybody going back i'm gonna take you to the restaurant today i'm so glad you say yes now we're gonna get all the favor from daddy he's gonna open all the doors you playing games let's go to roof chapter 2. hallelujah watch roof chapter 2 verse 2. and roof them all about this say to naomi let me go to the field and glean ears of corn after him of whose side i i found what look at the language of this woman where did she learn grace who taught her grace and she said to her grow my daughter what an easy daughter-in-law i don't have to teach this is strange okay go let's see what you got you ready verse three and she went by the robert got it again and came and gleaned in the field after the reapers everybody watch next and her hap was do you know what happened you know what it means her hap was means she happened what you call hazard what you call by chance you call it like that but melchizedek doesn't see it like that but here because once you make it right here the righteousness of christ comes on you everybody here and the footsteps of the are water they have a gps they have a gps the footstep of a righteous have a gps they will tell you i will come and after a while they turn around they say i'm sorry something is telling me to go this way they have a different gps everybody here they use 85 as they're going through 85 something says stay on 74. they stay on 74 and accidentally 35 because their footsteps have a gps everybody okay watch again he said and it happened to light on a part of the field belonging to who how the first time this woman ever gleaned into a strange land not knowing her kinsmen redeemer just rising up in the morning and going after the ripper and there were many fields over there but the gps was moving here into a different field ever here but here maybe when she was walking the people were looking at her they said you need food she said i'm okay i'm okay she keep going she keep going and something say here roof didn't know what that means roof just

to the right roof going let's go to the left and everybody you seen here that's her that's her that's how she came from and the roof is just going going and suddenly i don't know but something in my heart brother stephen i don't know how to explain it but i just felt in my heart it's a gps go down here and it happened that she green she the the part of the field belonging to boaz who was everybody of kindred to who who did that oh it's by any chance it just happened that's what happens when you sneak out and play lottery too much lottery is wrong stop chasing after money everybody okay everybody okay you there and behold boys came from bethlehem and said to the reaper the lord be with you and the answer to him the lord god bless you my brother okay you got it then say boaz to his servant that was set over the reapers let me stay on the surface because the church ages are ready let me stay on the surface okay remain on the surface don't get there don't get there slow down the church edges are right there i can see when the holy place right there leave it alone anybody here who's themselves is this boss came on the same day that roof went it's the same day boaz is returning to bethlehem who is organizing all auditions who is orchestrating all of this who is putting everything together to work together according to his own prayer oh it just happened by like that

naturalized she could get the the the the judah passport everybody okay but the people still called her more advertised by accent are you okay it's just the word made flesh i'm just actualizing it everybody okay he said the more about this themselves that came back with nahomi out of the country of moab there was a conversation between the chief reaper and the roof and that conversation happened in the morning let's see now verse seven and she said this is roof who was talking to him before boaz i pray you with prayer roof already left she's in the promised land she begin to pray she

your eyes be on the field that they do what everybody okay the maiden are women everybody okay and ruth is a woman everybody okay because under the vision of brother branham of the third pool ever here first of all they put a lure on the hook you remember and they cast it there it's usually the little fish ever here that goes after it's the maiden that goes because there is a movement back here so the third roof check the movement of the maiden check the little fish ever here when you pull the hook over here the load of fishes will begin to follow the hook and he gives he get the attraction of the rainbow trout to see the maiden so the telling roof follows another fishes when they go it means there is movement going on did i lose somebody do you know what i'm talking about you know what i'm talking about the pools are hidden right here boys say follow the medal look at the little fishes the little fish is always run after revival when they begin to to to rip they run when you see without for going on then the rainbow trout begin to go everybody here everybody here you go after them after the maiden have i not charged you the young men shall not molest you touch you so you see a pastor sleeping with women in the church get out of that church [Music] and when you are thirsty go to the vessels and drink of that which the young men have drawn verse 10 then she fell on her face and bow herself to the ground and say why have i found in your eyes that you should take knowledge of who singing i am what why am i receiving all this stuff everything i'm doing is working why since i gave my life i pray it happened i pray it happened i pray it happened boy i say let me explain you what happened what happened the reason why you're receiving all of this is because of what happened in the brazilian altars watch verse 11 and boys answered and said here he was fully shown me he was fully being showed me everybody here all that you have done to your mother-in-law since the death of elimelech elimelech was not your husband he was your father-in-law since the death of your own husband not naomi's husband your first husband was dead you were free you could go back and do whatever you want to do anybody here and how you have left your water forsaken all right everybody okay and left yahoo forsaking all and the land of your water nativity and now come to a people which you knew not before the lord recompense your work and a full reward be giving you of the lord god of israel under who's what you are come to do what so according to boaz what you did here you were putting yourself under god that's why things are happening the way they are happening because you didn't trust anymore on yourself you put your trust into the jehovah under the wings of the jehovah that's why everything is automatic that's why you came later in the message but you are moving faster than the children that were born in the message because the children that were born in the message never done this but you were prostituted you came from the street and you're moving faster and you're going to get the holy ghost because you trusted not in your parent religion but that parent religion became your own religion that's why god is opening the way quickly [Music] the decision that the president is very important because your justification will open make way to your sanctification everybody okay then roof move from there to the water she say where i'm buried you bury me the burial spoke about the resurrection it is the death the burial and the resurrection which which is symbolized in the world of baptism let's get this and then let you go home you there brother branham say watch when i baptize people and you minister take this for an example i have taught those people until they had that life cleanup am i reading another quote before they went to the water that's why benecosta misses it everybody here and i had them believing that god was obligated to keep his promise as soon as there was baptized in the name of jesus christ the holy spirit was right there to receive it and when they came up out of the water they received the holy ghost brother bradham said the key is i stood with them and i taught them so much until as soon as i put them in the world come out the holy ghost is in them how are we baptizing people in the message how one day we baptized 42 people one day we baptized 30 people come down out come down look at their lives after buttons anybody here shepherd teach your sheep get them in the bible here brother branham pat in his bible ever here get away from the old textbook not the message the old textbook from the denomination of some churches and get down here in the bible where god taught and you won't have those water do you see why we have trouble in the message how are we baptized but young people get so enthusiasm as soon as two are baptized i'm gonna be right baptized also boom i'm gonna be re-baptized also boom i'm gonna be and we came up there we say praise the lord the young people are touched this morning we baptize 25 of them tomorrow living like devil sleeping with men everybody here everybody here what is baptism in the level but for us also to whom it shall be imputed if we believe on him that raise up jesus our lord from the dead who was delivered for our offenses and was raised again for our what knowing not that so many of us as were baptized into jesus christ were baptized into his what so the baptism here is only an expression of what happened right here what happened at the brazen altar is supernatural what happened in a president is completely invisible the present alter work is an inward work even though we speak by confession and that work is invisible nobody knows whether you really accept it or not we only saw you at the altar so to give us a proof that you really accepted it you need to come to the water when you go in the water we look at you like this man really mean business that's why naomi stood up and stayed quiet she said when i where i would die where i would baptize where i would be buried that's it she got baptized let's go i'm not going to say anything anymore i got it ever here therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death that like as christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the father even so we also should walk in the newness of life for if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death we shall also be in the likeness of his water that's why we are bearing whoop and come up everybody okay hang tight what is going on else what shall they do which are baptized for the dead that death is not plural anybody here if the dead rise not at all why are dead dead baptized for the dead why do we baptize for the dead that dead is singular brother branham say paul speaking here was talking of the dead jesus christ if the dead was not why are you baptized in jesus christ's name then if the dead was not but he goes ahead and glorified god for the glory for the resurrection of the dead and we are baptized to jesus christ unto his death whereas where you die i will die unto his bear where you bury up your berry and this water that is why we baptize unto the death i have not called it yet brother stephen let me help you up they like figure where unto even baptism dude also now save us not the putting away of filth of the flesh but the answer of a good water conscience toward who but the rage by the resurrection of who now i believe that you are saved by accepting jesus christ brazen altar and water baptism is an outward expression to show that something inwardly invisible has happened because water have no virtue it's just a water it doesn't clean you up it is just a proof to us that you really mean business everybody okay my god some of you were baptized don't even know this anybody here now let's go to act chapter nine we've seen the pattern here repentance everybody okay be baptized everybody care give me some time and then i'll let you go home let me erase this hallelujah number one repentance everybody okay number two be baptized baptism roof baptism number three we found there is a space of time everybody okay that space of time have prayer everybody okay everybody okay and number four we have the baptism the holy ghost coming ever care in fire other court everybody okay holy place everybody holiest by conversion anybody okay everybody clear there now let's go in the scripture take act to chapter nine and then we go home let me nail it in the scripture should i be baptized again brother stephen hold on there act now if you're there you can say amen act nine let's go to verse three we know it's about paul and as he journeyed he came near damascus and suddenly there shone around about him a light from heaven and he fell on the earth and heard a voice saying to him so so why are you persecuting me everybody and he said who are you lord yes paul is asking the light who are you anybody here and the lord that light say i am jesus whom you persecute it is hard for you to kick against the priests everybody okay and he trembling and as astonished saying lord what will you have me to do and the lord said to him arise and go into the city and it shall be told you what you must do number one paul was a hedge it was a header of jesus christ he hated jesus and he hated the people the uh preacher jesus christ he hated christians you need to get this very good because when we when we will get to ezekiel about giving you a new heart you will understand what it means i have to go through all those avenues and right here so at first the disposition of paul was wrong toward jesus christ everybody okay when i will get to ezekiel you will be jumping happy back here number one zero paul was had a wrong disposition a wrong disposition toward christ he hated christ hey but when christ unfolded to him into an experience this experience did not give paul the holy ghost can i repeat again paul saw the pillar of fire he spoke with the peter of fire the penal fire spoke back to him but he didn't receive the holy ghost oh when i was a child i saw a pillar of fire when i was talking i was a period when i was eating the pillar of fire doesn't mean you received the holy ghost what was the purpose of this experience you okay when paul asked he said who are you he said i'm jesus you hating everybody that carried my name i am that person that you heading i am he paul's turn around he say lord who are you i never understood that the pillar of fire was you because when i talked i talked i was talking to the lord this is the pillar of fire that spoke to moses this is elohim so now elohim was really you oh i am the standard i am sorry lord what do you want me to do the experience everybody change of you toward jesus christ but he didn't give him the holy ghost he only changed poor disposition from this day if you talk about jesus christ paul doesn't see jesus again as an enemy because the enmity that was between paul and jesus christ has been broken [Music] everybody okay everybody in other words paul met christ at the brazen altar i'm going slowly everybody here paul changed his heart his heart doesn't hate god anymore brother kelly his heart now begin to love jesus christ and his light his heart became obedient to what jesus is saying number one checked paul had an experience he's paul baptist yet but paul changed his disposition remember brother branham said to repent means to what so paul now is no more on 85 south paul now have changed to 85 north jesus was jehovah of the old testament i just spoke to jehovah of the old testament and when jehovah was talking to me it was jesus christ paul got repented everybody okay you need a prophet but no what a baptism yet let's continue you want to go home oh yeah i'm going to give you four examples so you get vaccinated very well everybody okay let's go to verse nine everybody here let's go to verse eight and saul arrows from the earth and when his eyes were open he saw no man but they led him by the hand and brought him to water and he was three days without sight and neither did eat nor drink somebody was this church is deadly somebody was fasting let me put it somewhere here fasting we will try to put it somewhere you okay he was fasting everybody here verse 10 and there was a certain disciple at damascus named ananias and to him say the lord in a vision ananias and he said behold i am here and the lord said to him arise and go in a street which is called street and inquire in the house of judas the house of judas let me leave it alone for one call saw of torches four by the robes you you broke my thunder and so and and behold he does what he does what elijah before the fire came did what solomon before the fire came did what everybody okay at the opening of the seven seal my friend this bible became a new he was doing what so in between paul repenting and paul receiving the holy ghost brother michael oh mark we found paul doing what oh prayer is well check prayer plus fasting check is he baptized yet did he receive the holy ghost yet let's see the holy ghost you there you there let's go to verse 13 then and another sensor lord i have heard by many of these men how much evil he have done for your scent roof is a moabitess girl roof the more bites girl roof the more bites girl then boaz turn he say roof my daughter paul lord for he made the mess of your christian ananias i know i already met him in the president on the road to damascus he already changed his disposition toward me he's no more an enemy who is it i don't know my wife this time gets so juicy towards the end let's go to verse sorry trusty i'm trying i'm trying i'm going to land let's go to to to verse 14. and there uh verse 15 but the lord said to him go your way for he is an enemy to me the one you saying a wicked man the bad guy you're talking about he is not a bad guy he was the devil making you think like that he was a chosen vessel he is an elector everybody here oh ananias say my goodness so he's my brother god said yes but ahead no i changed him on the road everybody here he's a chosen vessel to bear my name it's like a thunder who's going to bear your name god that man this is a more about this woman boys you calling her your daughter everybody here everybody here job to verse 17. ananias now change his view toward paul but paul doesn't have the holy ghost yet hallelujah now ananias is coming to paul let's see if he is going to go you messy boy how are you doing ever here you troublemaker how are you doing the lord told me you troublemaker let's see how ananias is calling him without the holy ghost brother john i'm sorry i don't know what to do verse 17 and ananias went his way and entering in the house and putting what he was not coming up like let me have a two by four just in case ananias came he didn't say obviously ananias came he say [Music] because something already happened to her everybody here it is opening the door to the second one it's making way for paul everybody here and then he says he put his hand on him camera and say water a brother without the holy ghost ananias calling brother because he already changed his disposition that's why when you are baptized in jesus name you get into this message we begin to call you brother but you don't have the holy ghost yet brother so and so brother son so no holy ghost tell the brother you need to keep moving if not the brother will do something wrong and he stumble you because you gave him the holy ghost too quick brother kelly i don't know what to do i don't know what to do everybody okay he called him brother son the lord even jesus had that appeared to you in the way as you came has sent me that you might receive your and be what anybody okay everybody okay and immediately they fell from his eyes as he had been scared and he received full sight and arose and was what paul they sent me by your boss for you to be everybody okay filled with the holy ghost when paul received the holy ghost paul miss and paul did what everything finished any question any question let me skip some of them quickly let me skip some of them quickly because of the form of the time let's go to act chapter 10. second example amen brother bronham say i believe paul the reason that he had to be baptized again is he did what everybody okay i have chosen him a vessel to the gender god knew that ananias will be able to baptize him in the name of jesus christ in the damascus river three days later but i believe his sin were already the message and the bible are [Music] everybody okay paul by by just this experience they took away that sin away everybody here but he doesn't have the holy ghost yet everybody okay everybody okay but he had to do this brother kalima to show to the because they know him a bad boy we need to see you in the water you got the holy ghost fine get in the water so because the water is our proof that you change go back in the water everybody here and i believe that the reason that we must be baptized in the name of jesus christ and i believe the predestinated seed will see it they have to baptize him so when he came out of the water everybody dropped their weapon they say he's a brother pull him inside let's go to the restaurant he's a brother take him to the restaurant everybody okay let's go to cornelius example two please give me grace are you there are you there let's go to verse one there was a certain man in caesarea called cornelius a centurion of the band called the italian a devout man and one that feared god with all his house which gave much arm to the water indeed what water a man that already feel god everybody okay can i check can i check on this board a man that already feel god there is no problem between him and god he's a devout man and he's a man that was given to what prayer everybody clear so we get through here is he baptized does he have the holy ghost did he see the angel coming and talk to him yes but no holy ghost who has the holy ghost everybody here he saw in a vision evidently like paul about the nine hour the angel coming down to him saying to him cornelius everybody here jump to verse 22. i'm skipping now tom let's go to 22. and they say everybody okay cornelius your pre uh cornelius de santillion can anybody read that for me a water so he was justified and justification means he already cleared repentance but justification also take the baptism as an outward expression but cornelius is not baptized yet but we see cornelius praying already he's in preparation in prayer already so cornelius is devout he's on sanctification he's already praying he's on the holy place and back here he's already in the holy place but he's not in the holiest yet how did he get in the holiest everybody okay job to verse 44. ever here and why you there and why peter yet spoke this word the water fell on all them the all them which heard him and they of the circumcision which believed were astonished as many as uh came with peter because that the gentile also was poured out the water of the water now cornelius have this one everybody okay on the board what is missing let's see let's go to verse 47. four can any man forbid water that this should not be baptized which received the water as well as we and he commanded them peter to be water in the name of water can i check here what is missing again in cornelius redemption donna can i give you two more can i give you two more let's go to actor chapter [Music] 19 i taught you for like two sermons or three now i'm nailing down in the scripture let's go to act chapter 19 if you can if you're there you can say amen verse one you there i'm skipping a lot now and he came to pass that while apollos was in congress paul having passed through the apricos came to ephesus a church and finding certain water this is a disciple an enemy so can we check number one can we check it so since we check too much i'm gonna do this okay so we know this is checked okay okay disciple and he said to them have you received the water since you water so those disciples already believed they already have repented everybody okay paul is asking them did you get here they were disciple they were leaving the christian life already they were already praying everybody okay but no holy ghost paul say did you receive the holy ghost since you number one we give the holy ghost on number one anybody okay since you believe and they said to him we have not so much as a word whether there be any holy ghost and he said to them to what what paul now begin to go back to the checklist paul say wait a minute baptism is check what repentance is check you believe her you don't know what the holy ghost means wait a minute which other court let's go back to the other code come on come on now come out everybody come out i thought you were in the holy place come out they all came out back again here on the on the on the on the uh on the water add a coat let's go to the other coat stand there did you get baptized amen and they said to the baptist mofu john then say paul john verily baptized with the baptism of repentance saying to the people that they should believe on him which should come after that is on christ that was the first baptism but the progression already moved you have to move with the second provision amen so something is a glitch there what is going on and when they heard this they didn't feel like they were not believers they didn't think that their pastor was telling them you are not christian they obey in the state where they were and they begin to correct that state to move forward everybody okay and when they heard that this they were water ah we are here on number two there were water now can we check this so we got one two three what is remaining let's see if the holy ghost comes they were baptized uh they were baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ and when paul had laid his hand upon them the water everybody okay paul cornelius emphasis three go to act eight and we finish here i can get you to the court go to act eight you there if you're there you can say amen actor chapter eight verse nine everybody here but there was a certain man called salmon which before time in the same city use water was this man for christ or against christ brother kelly he used sorcery and bewitched the people of samaria giving out that himself was some great one to whom they all gave hid from the least to the greatest the whole city saying this man is the great power of god do you see how people give the power of the devil sometime that the power of god ever and to him they they had regard because that for a long time he bewitched them with sorceries everybody here you there watch now verse 12 deadly thing but when they did what can i check number one can i check again let me raise this again they did what repentances were here were they baptized were they baptized let's go down the checklist when they believe philly preaching the thing concerning the kingdom of god and the name of jesus christ come out they were everybody okay now everybody okay now what remains prayer and what let's see they were baptized both men and women then someone himself did what believe also and when he was baptized he did what someone the sorcerer believed and was baptized the other people also believe and were baptized but when you believe you must be careful if you really believe it or not because your believing will open up the way to the other stages everybody okay let's see what happened and wondered beholding the miracle and what which we were which were when someone believed and were and was baptized his mind was only about the miracle oh he's praying for the sick they are here it's all about miracle that's what attracted him everybody okay verse 9 the verse 14 now when the apostle which were jerusalem heard that samaria had received the word of god they said to them who peter and john who when they were calm down pray for water that they might receive the water for us yet they were not receiving the holy ghost yet i want you to have that in your mind for as yet he was not fallen upon none of them they believed god they were baptized but nobody have the holy ghost how many people have the holy ghost in the message do you see why we got trouble that we get in the message just because somebody believed the message ever here none of them they were baptized in the name of jesus christ then lay dead their hand on them and they received the what can i check this or two but let's see salmon everybody here verse 18 and when someone saw that through the laying of the hands of the apostles the holy ghost was given he offered them what the president although was wrong he blocked him because the holy ghost fell but he didn't receive it everybody received it not him because your president is wrong now his mind was about making money because he was making money before by sorcery now he was looking at the power that he can use for for money again but here saying verse 19 give me also this power that on whomsoever lay hand he may receive the water and peter said to him your money perish with you he wants money all the time what is your disposition what are you looking for money money money money minded don't go to church money don't do this over time over time don't worry about your spirituality ever here your money perish with you because you have thought that the gift of god may be purchased with money you need a have part no lot in water by predestination we can see now that you don't belong to this ever here everybody else went through this except someone last drop to verse 27 and now finish here first paul second cornelius three disciple of ephesus four salmon father the utopian eunuch and he arose and went and behold the men of ethiopia a eunuch of great authority under camden's queen of the ethiopian who had the charge over all his treasure and he had come to jerusalem for to do what was he the believer can i check this was he baptized did they receive the holy ghost you there everybody here then verse 9 29 let me go to 28 i'm sorry was returning and sitting in his chariot reading isaiah the prophet young preacher get this then the spirit said to philip go near and join yourself to this chariot and philip randy to him and heard him read the the prophet the prophet the prophet the prophet isaiah and say understand you what you read you can read the prophet and don't understand what the prophet is saying [Music] a believer that was reading the message book but i have no understanding full of them in the message churches brother branham said brother branham say you do tomorrow sleeping with women on the hotel tomorrow skirt always here here here tight don't understand the prophet everybody here and he said how can i except someone should water you must have a fireform ministry to unlock the profit everybody okay everybody okay and guide me and he desired look at this look look at that pool he desire don't sleep i'm done i'm gonna see you talking outside in desire philip that he would come up and sit with him the place of the scripture where he read was this he was led as a ship to the slaughter like a lamp you know what it is it's isaiah hey jump to verse 34. and the unique answer peter and say uh philip and say i pray you of whom the prophet say uh the prophet this speak this of himself or of some other he was reading the prophet he have a problem decoding whether the prophet was preaching about himself or the prophet was preaching about christ [Music] reading the message of the hour [Applause] oh that was just the opinion of brother branham you have a difficulty if brother branham is really talking about himself or he's talking about somebody else this message beautiful beautiful my friend you see but that's why brother branham said this is where you have a difficulty separating the two when brother branham turned the back is he talking about himself or is he talking about somebody many believe in the message everybody here then phillip opened his mouth for folk ministry anointed and distracted by god not any far from ministry philip had the holy ghost ever here and began at the same scripture and preached to him who isaiah was talking like he was him but philip could decode that it's not him behind what you see there he's just a son it is jesus christ this message is not brother branham this message is jesus christ [Music] you need to look beyond the flesh and see jesus christ in this message this message is crossed [Music] you're not feeding on the word of a man you're not feeding on the word of brother branham we are fair feeding upon the unfailing body world of the son of man when we say brother branham say it is jesus christ your husband is the revealed world not the man he was a carrier but the jesus christ that brother brown i'm introducing oh my god glory to god hallelujah let me finish here and as they went on the way they came to a certain water to a certain water to a certain water and the eunuch see and say here is the water justification make way the man is automatically philip didn't tell him this is water do you want me to baptize him no he was the other one who was following pastor i need to get baptized who taught him who gave you the desire to get baptized come on but here baptize and philip say look at philip i want to get baptized philip say you want to get baptized the car is still running the chariot is going philip say okay final check let's go to the other court there's two things in the other court unique you must believe and be baptized let me make sure you got the altar first verse 37 and philip say if you everybody okay let's go back to the altar if you believe with all your you must be sincere unique so you can open all the doors it will be automatic god himself will pull you there we believe with all your heart you may and he answered and say i believe that jesus christ is the water verse 38 and then he commanded they sell you the cheryl to do what philip say push the break that's all i want to confirm come out let's go to the level you already passed the resident let's go let me take you to the level now because you confirmed to me the president ever here and when he baptized he commanded the chariot and they went down buffing the water not sprinkling buff philip and the eunuch and he did water and when he came out of the water the water so the spirit of the lord was ready okay the holy ghost was right there right there because they taught him right the holy ghost was right there he took phillip off and he handled the champion and then and the spirit called him away and that unit saw him no more and he went in his way what this is the day he keeps moving he keep moving that's it game over five example skip skip skip skip skip let me go slowly so you can read it yourself at home skip you get it brother you got it on the screen okay skip you can read it at home okay skip you can get it at home okay skip you can get it at home skip you might have left him at baptism you might have left him at the holy ghost you might have left him somewhere wherever you left him don't take this heartbreaking church stuff there is one that represents you this morning for salvation skip i was baptized at 13 shall i be baptized again you want to know about it let's stand there with everything you taught brother stephen should that be re-baptized again because now i understand now that i went to this altar i didn't know what i was doing should i be baptized again somebody's trembling i already did it good brother branham say if you have been a christian all along since you was 13 years old a believer in christ i would just remain like you are i would not now if god has blessed you and give you the don't do it again the baptism is only a form to show the world or the congregation that you are with at that time that you before witnesses prove that you have believed that god sent his son and died and rose again on the third day and you was buried in him and have reason to walk in the newness of life and the same people that watch you when you was baptized will meet you at the judgment if your life has been good god gave you the holy ghost don't do it but you say brother bill did you ever baptize anybody over who had been baptized when there was a little fellow and they've been rebaptized many times now there is a scripture in revelation they say repent and do your first work brother branham corrected this he said he was not talking to the individual he was talking to the church that's wrong you can read it but random say i'm not disagreeing with this because we have got baptistry filled we are ready to baptize anybody that wants to be baptized any time if you want to be baptized if that is something that is standing in your way and you feel like you should be you go do it that's right you got to do it don't let nothing stand in your way you make yourself perfectly clear what are you saying brother stephen by this if you have taken something years ago and you feel like you should go make it that right you got to make it right no matter what it is you keep everything clear because you shall come up to that thing and you can't go any further till you get that out of the way see you just got to lay aside every weight and the thing that so easily beset you if you want to be baptized again go ahead that's the thing to do i have baptized many over but if you want to be baptized you was baptized when you were 13 or whatever age why you want to be baptized if it is on your way what are you talking about brother stephen brother brother say if you have been if you have been redeemed and you feel that the blood of jesus christ cleaned you from sin then i would live a christian life i wouldn't think it would be necessary the man that baptized me in the name of the lord jesus christ finally run me out of the church because i would not agree with him on women preachers that didn't make me be re-baptized again what brother bradham is saying if you are living a christian life since you got baptized you don't have to do it over you've seen through all the example baptism is essential even if you got the holy ghost you miss it they go back to you to give it to you but brother brother is saying that if you feel a condemnation in your heart that is telling you you must correct certain things if you feel it yourself you need to go corrected but if there is no condemnation everything is good you continue in your life everybody let's pray heavenly father lord we thank you for your grace your love and your mercy and for everything you have been doing for us father i'm sorry i took a little bit more of the time but i have to grant this thing to the people so that they can see the plan of salvation clearly because with confusion people have been locked and the devil loved it and locked the people in different states where they can see no victory they try with their might they don't see anything happening in their life and the more they have tried for years father they get discouraged and they don't want to fight anymore because they're confused but lord you send your word to correct the error you gave us the precious word that would come lord and clear everything all the smoke away so that we can see clearly what we're talking about and we can't understand now by justification did we come to the altar the right way did we come by emotion did we get here because of a family did we get here because of a certain benefit like some on the sorcery did we come here which way did we come did we repented right did we confess our self right did we accepted the person of jesus christ have we died at the brazen altar have we been stripped from our families our countries our colleagues our uh uh association all these things have we forsaken all are we in the point that everything in our life have been giving the preeminence to you have we been baptized right have we make that decision correctly if it's so where is the holy ghost and if we have done it correctly father it is time for us to go to preparation to get into prayer to pray like elijah to pray like solomon to pray like paul was praying to pray like the disciples were praying in the upper room further waiting and praying so that that holy spirit can come and seal this faith and complete the work of redemption and then we can look up and to adoption further i commit everything that was spoken onto the hand may you help this church
