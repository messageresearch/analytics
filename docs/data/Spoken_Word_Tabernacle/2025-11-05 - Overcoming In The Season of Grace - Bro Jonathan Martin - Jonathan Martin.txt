========================================

The devil always looked in to find out what he was. One day they said, "If he's the Messiah, he'll he'll certainly do some strange signs." He said, "If thou BE THE SON OF GOD, TURN THESE STONES INTO BREAD." Messiah is a miracle worker. He is yet. He's always been certainly the Messiah was anointed one. The anointed one TODAY IS THE MESSIAH CHURCH. THIS CHURCH, this church OF THE NEWBORN, THIS CHURCH HAS COME THROUGH THE WATER. FAITH COMETH BY HEARING THROUGH THE BLOOD CLEANSED LIFE THROUGH THE BAPTISM OF THE HOLY GHOST. Holy Ghost is the anointed one, the Messiah Church. GLORY TO GOD. &gt;&gt; WHY? MESSIAH CHURCH WILL HAVE SIGNS OF MESSIAH. HALLELUJAH. SURE. BECAUSE IT'S A MESSIAH CHURCH. &gt;&gt; It is the church of the Messiah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That makes me feel as good AS THAT I DID A WHILE AGO. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. A Messiah CHURCH WITH THE MESSIAH power with Messiah signs. Amen. &gt;&gt; There you are. That's where you have fellowship. Oh, there's nothing like it. It's perfect. Now, think of Jehovah doing a thing like that. Here he was. The devil looked at him and said, "I wonder if that really is the son of God. I wonder is that just an ordinary prophet or is that the son of God?" HE SAID, "IF THOU BE THE SON OF GOD, COMMAND THESE stones to be turned to bread." See, he was really an intellectual boy. He he he really knowed what he was talking about. But Jesus said, "It is written." &gt;&gt; Now, he take him up and kept trying him to find out. One day, he got him in the in the gentile courts and he kept wondering, "Could that be?" See, God really pulled the wool over Satan's eyes when that super sign came. &gt;&gt; He didn't know what he was. How could Jehovah be born in a manger? How could Jehovah cry like a baby and wearing's claw? [music] &gt;&gt; [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] &gt;&gt; Amen and amen.

If you're not excited, I am excited. &gt;&gt; And I can tell you the reason why I'm excited. &gt;&gt; Oh, let's just move on with the service. &gt;&gt; Amen. [laughter] It was it was about two weeks ago, if I'm not me, two weeks or three weeks ago, they were the the the the builder came to pour the concrete and they were waiting on the inspector and the inspector came and push a block. It I mean it stopped right there and with the mixed cement and everything was mixed and everything was ready to be poured. They stopped they say we cannot pour. We need to There was a drawing that it's not our fault. The drawing was missed by the CD to look at the drawing or something like that. So now all that material that was wasted is on us. Don't worry about it. We got the God of John Shar. Amen. God will take care of it. So we say, you know what, the best way to do it, no more inspection when the poor. You come and do your inspection first, then we poor later. So yesterday we had a prayer meeting, &gt;&gt; a wonderful one, &gt;&gt; and we pray for inspection for the concrete slab and the footing. And guess what? Both of them pass. [applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. after the rain and all the suffering of removing the the mud and the leaves and repositioning everything and and sucking the water out and you don't know what type of work was done here. But brother set, brother Michael, brother John, brother Robert, I don't know. God richly bless you and return a thousandfold for all the work and the labor that has been doing. Amen. So now everything is wide open to come and pour. God started this work. &gt;&gt; Huh? &gt;&gt; Brother, you go ahead and finish it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, I forgot. Brother Zach, I am so sorry. Brother Zach was there, too. My apology. He was there getting everything ready. Praise God. Oh my. My My apology. That's the problem when you start naming names. So now the next time I say the whole crew that was there. So I get everybody covered. But it is a big miracle that we cross that because he can't block everything. We can't move. And if another rain would have come, oh then it will be a disaster that you have to cover everything and water and get the water out because they don't even want to see a mud around the the the rebar or anything. So you got to remove the mud and everything need to look nice and neat and that's the job that was done by the brothers. So we thank you for everything and praise the Lord. Now we got the way paved so they can pour. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And there was a correction that needed to be done on the front u connector up there when they did the framing there. And we call on brother Solomon to come and do the work. And he say he will not charge us to do the correction. And brother Solomon is right there tonight. [applause] Amen. So, Brother Solomon, on behalf of Spoken Word, thank you very much for everything, for the labor and the love and the framing. It's it give you such a peace. You know, you're dealing with brothers and you are investing on the brother. they're getting blessed and also they're doing a wonderful job that you sure they're really doing the job from the bottom of the heart knowing that they're doing the job for the Lord. So God richly bless you for everything and may he bless your company. Amen. And may we prosper. If you need quote I got the line up and I got scripture line up so everything is good. Amen. So we greet you all in the precious name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ both visible and invisible audience. Any family members here God richly bless you and welcome on Wednesday to our convention at spoken word tabernacle. Amen. Everybody clear now with the wisdom of God. &gt;&gt; So when we speak about prosperity, we're speaking about the person of Jesus Christ. Amen. And that person take care of everything for us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He can heal. He can provide financially. He can raise the dead. He can do everything because he's our LA Leon. Amen. &gt;&gt; If you ask for wisdom, then you get everything else. But if you ask for money, you will miss wisdom. If you ask for long life and you will miss wisdom. But if you got wisdom, wisdom will provide everything. That's why we seek first the kingdom of God, then everything. Don't stop at first the kingdom of God. Continue the verse. Then everything will be added unto. So if the first one is already fulfilled, so don't block my way. &gt;&gt; Don't block my way for God to begin to add because I'm under expectation now for God to begin to add everything because the kingdom is already there. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. The young men's remember we got a meeting on Saturday. Everything you know the place, you know the time. But as a reminder, brother Tony will probably put it on uh uh church group chat so you remember that continue in prayer. I usually give you like 3 minutes to stay in silence, but that's just an exercise. But when you're alone praying, this is when you sit down 20 30 minute quiet and you wait on the Lord and you will hear that voice begin to talk to you. Then everything will be you've been hearing in the message won't be anymore just quote. it will become a reality to you and you will learn how God specifically talk to you different than somebody else. Amen. But prayer is doing a lot of things and prayer changes things. Amen. So tonight our speaker for the convention is brother Jonathan Martin. &gt;&gt; This is your first time probably to see him here. He's welcome. He's the brother of brother Shawn Martin. If you remember, Brother Sean preached for us. He's a pastor in Virginia. If I'm not mistaken, he preached for us in a hotel. So, we've been hunting his brother for a while. And suddenly, the Holy Spirit gave us an open door. So, coming down from Ohio all the way there coming down to preach for us. Amen. So, Brother Jonathan Martin, welcome. I told him he's home. He's not a visitor. He's going to preach like home and we will pull like home. Amen. I don't talk to preacher about what they need to preach. I let them do what the Lord, what the Holy Ghost speak. So hear what the spirit say and you will see how God is working in a miraculous way. Amen. So forever only believe. [music] Oh, believe. [music] Oh, we believe [music and singing] all things [music] are impossible. [singing] Only [singing and music] believe. Only [singing and music] believe. All [singing] we believe [music] all things [singing and music] are [music] Lord. I receive. Lord [singing] [music] I receive. Lord [singing] [music] receive all things [singing] [music] are possible. Lord [singing] I [music] receive. Oh Lord [singing] I [music] receive. Lord, [singing] I receive. [music] All things are [singing and music] possible, Lord, I [singing and music] receive. Isn't that a tremendous thing to be able to say that we not only believe, but we receive the promises of God and everything that God has promised us in this hour. We are beneficiaries. &gt;&gt; We're beneficiaries of his resurrection. &gt;&gt; He not only died, he was not only buried, but he resurrected. That's right. And we are a part of the resurrection in this age. not a part of dead denominationalism, but we've raised out of that and &gt;&gt; we're a part of a living God and a living reality that God is in the midst of his people. &gt;&gt; Amen. And uh it's so good to be in the house of the Lord on a Wednesday night and and uh we just appreciate uh your pastor, brother Stephen, for just opening the uh invitation to us to come and and uh we've just uh uh we've just been hearing about all the good things that God has been doing for you and and uh just been blessing you, prospering you, and and uh the building project and things. And uh I just say God just keep pouring it on. &gt;&gt; Amen. I I tell you I I I believe in the right kind of prosperity and [cheering] the the prosperity our our brother spoke of and you know I think that we are uh again beneficiaries and and uh I think God is just pouring out his blessings upon his people and &gt;&gt; and uh you know he's just going to keep pouring it out until we are not for God's going to take us home. &gt;&gt; Amen. And so we're not beggars in this life. We're we're kings and we're priests and and uh we we have a right to come into his presence and into his shakina glory. And uh amen. So uh for those of you who don't know me, I say God richly bless you. And uh we love the message with everything that is within us. And uh we believe that Jesus said that if I be exalted, I'll draw all men unto me. And we believe this message is Christ. And we're just trying to exalt this message so high &gt;&gt; above every problem, above every difficult situation in your life. And just keep exalting Christ higher and higher. Amen. I believe that's the anointing that is upon the church of the living God. And it's an eagle anointing. It's &gt;&gt; and it's just causing us to lose all uh just lose uh just just rise above all of our these earthbound senses. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And uh so we bring greetings from brother Wayne and uh True Word Tabernacle there and uh at home. Brother Wayne's our pastor and uh so we just send uh just bring greetings to to everyone. &gt;&gt; And uh so uh see brother Solomon back there. God bless you, buddy. Amen. And uh so we just want to go into the word now and we'll turn to Zechariah the 4th chapter beginning at verse one and then also Psalms 110 and verse three. And uh there's a lot of things that we can bring out of these portions of scriptures. Uh but we've just got something that uh that has just uh been dropped into our heart and we just pray that it'll be a blessing to you. Amen. &gt;&gt; And I'd like to speak on overcoming in the season of grace. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, Zechariah the 4th chapter beginning at verse one. And the angel that talked with me came again and wake me as a man that is wakened out of his sleep and said unto me, What seeest thou? And I said, I have looked, and behold, a candlestick all of gold with a bowl upon the top of it, and his seven lamps thereon, and seven pipes to the seven lamps which are upon the top thereof, and two olive trees by it, one upon the right side of the bowl, and the other upon the left side thereof. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So I answered and spake to the angel that talked with me, saying, "What are these, my Lord?" Then the angel that talked with me answered and said unto me, "Knowest thou not what these be?" And I said, "No, my Lord." Then he answered and spake unto me, saying, "This is the word of the Lord, and Zerupel, saying, Not by might, nor by power, but by my spirit, saith the Lord of hosts." &gt;&gt; Amen. Who art thou, oh great mountain, before Zerubabel? Thou shalt become a plain sir. &gt;&gt; And he shall bring forth the headstone thereof with shoutings, crying, grace, grace unto it. Ain't that a beautiful scripture? &gt;&gt; Amen. He shall bring forth the headstone, &gt;&gt; shouting grace, grace unto it. Yes. &gt;&gt; Now, Psalms 110 and verse three, thy people shall be willing in the day of thy power. &gt;&gt; Now, I believe that I'm speaking to that people, which is God's people, &gt;&gt; that we are a gentile bride that's been called out for his name's sake. &gt;&gt; And so, the scripture that is he's referring or the people he's referring to is a bride. I I believe that we are that people. Thy people &gt;&gt; shall be willing. &gt;&gt; That word willing is meaning spontaneous. &gt;&gt; Amen. They will they'll be willing to move into action. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; In the day of thy power &gt;&gt; in the beauties of holiness from the womb of the morning thou hast the dw of thy youth. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, if we could just bow our hearts in a word of prayer and maybe you want to be remembered this evening. Why don't you just make it known by an upraised hand? I know God sees every need. Heavenly Father, we're so grateful to be assembled in divine presence on this Wednesday night. Lord, we so appreciate the songs that have been sung. We appreciate the atmosphere that has been created. Lord, truly we recognize that you're in our midst. And Father, there's a group of believers gathered together, called out for your name's sake, Lord, we're we're recognizing that this is our time. This is bride time, Lord. And it's a time that we could ask for whatsoever we would and you would give it to us, Lord. I pray God that you would meet the needs of the people Lord and the request that is upon their heart father and move so supernatural Lord. &gt;&gt; I pray God that there would be such a Lord just such a moving of your spirit just bless your children. We ask it at the name of Jesus Christ. Amen and amen. God richly bless you. You can be seated. Overcoming in the season of grace. And we're very familiar uh with this uh quote in the invisible union of the bride of Christ. And you are wearing the wedding band of predestinated unmarited grace. That's right. &gt;&gt; A wedding band of grace unmmerited of your own. &gt;&gt; God did it himself. &gt;&gt; He knew you before the foundation of the world. So he slipped the wedding band on you there, put your name on a book. &gt;&gt; I I think that that is a marvelous thing that the prophet would say that God did it himself. &gt;&gt; He would say in the message of of grace, he would say that grace is from a sovereign one. Sovereign grace is from a sovereign one. And God is that sovereign one. He is the sovereign king and he does as he pleases. He does as he chooses, as he elects to do. Uh he doesn't need to ask permission from anyone. God simply does it because he is sovereign. &gt;&gt; The Bible says that we were chosen in him before the foundation of the world. And God being infinite and God knowing the end from the beginning. God knowing that you were in him. You were a part of his eternal life. Therefore, God forneew you. Therefore, he could predestinate you. And nothing is changing in his infinite wisdom. God being infinite, he never has had a new thought about anything. So God could predestinate because of his fornowledge. Therefore, he placed your name on the lamb's book of life. What a beautiful thing it is as the lamb's book of life. It doesn't have your deeds. It doesn't have your works. It just has your name because you are identified with the lamb. You're identified with his perfection. identified with his completion. So when we are looking at grace, we are looking at something that is unmmerited. It is simply the unmmerited favor of God upon your life. Amen. to think this evening that we are under the influence of the divine favor of the sovereign God, the King of Kings and the Lord of Lords who is the amen. He's the final say. You know, I know the devil, he likes to think and and likes to convince us that he's got the final say over our life. But in this last days, the leoty age, we find that the amen of God came into the age. The final say, the the the the absolute authority over our life has moved into the age. The infinite ancient of days, the the one who knew you before the foundation of the world has moved on in on the scene to declare that the devil does not have the final say over your condition. He doesn't have the final say over your family. He doesn't have the final say over anything. But when God says enough is enough, let me just say it like this. The devil will never have enough. He's never got enough over your family. He's not got enough over your situations. WHEN GOD says enough is enough, then he changes the scene. Hallelujah. So, the devil WAS CREATED AND ALL OF HIS angels were created to just be an adversary. But that adversary is working for our good to mold a character that is fit to rule for all eternity. I tell you friends, it's a the GREATEST REVELATION I believe. Amen. That God has given us is the revelation that God lives and he is supreme authority over this bride. He is our headstone. He is Amen. He has the Amen. He has the amen, THE FINAL SAY over our lives. Amen. The devil doesn't have enough. You see, we are under his influence. Amen. For a people who could not help themselves. Amen. Situations that are impossible to change. Amen. Health situations. Amen. Impossible to change. AMEN. HOME situations impossible to change. But you see, when we come up to a mountain, a situation that we can't go over it, we can't get around it, we can't get UNDER IT, BUT GOD WILL make a way through it. Hallelujah. I think of how the prophet Isaiah said, "Who hath believed I report and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed?" The prophet of God in the OPENING OF THE SEALS HE SAYS BELIEVE the report and the arm OF THE LORD WILL BE MADE MANIFEST. Uh you WANT TO SEE GOD MADE manifest in your life believe this message. You want TO SEE A SITUATION change in your marriage BELIEVE THIS MESSAGE. UH YOU WANT TO SEE THE POWER OF GOD SHAKE THIS CHURCH then believe THIS MESSAGE. IT'S THE AMEN OF GOD. IT'S THE FINAL SAY OVER every condition, every situation. Hallelujah. The prophet of God would say that Jesus Christ was God's love expressed. Hallelujah. It's not an angry God. You know, God being mad at us, but Jesus loves us. No sir, it is Jesus Christ is the expression. It it is the characteristics of God BEING EXPRESSED, AMEN, to his people. Amen. Slaved to sin, AMEN, BOUND IN DARKNESS and unbelief and going to a DEVIL'S HELL. AMEN. BUT GOD BEGIN TO begin to express his divine love. And when HE WENT TO CALVARY, IT WAS BECAUSE you were in his mind. AND IT WAS SOVEREIGN GRACE UH THAT NAILED HIM TO THAT CROSS. Uh hallelujah. It wasn't it wasn't because it wasn't Roman nails that did it. IT WAS THE LOVE OF GOD AND SOVEREIGN GRACE MET WHAT GOD needed for his sacrifice. Amen. You see the prophet would say it like this. When divine love is projected and comes to its destiny. Oh, don't you like that? When sovereign when divine love is projected and comes to its destiny, then sovereign grace takes over. Hallelujah. Well, I'm thinking of this last days, amen, when the church has been growing, amen, into a complete bride body. And it's prophesied, amen, that there will be a ministry that will introduce ush to the capstone. And the capstone is charity. It is Christ himself, the love OF GOD THAT IS COMING to its destiny. And it's moving upon individuals, sons and daughters of God that he forneew before the foundation of the world. Uh and he PREDESTINATED YOU FOR THIS TIME AND THIS SEASON. UH AND NOW IN THIS AGE UH THERE IS A MOVING UH OF DIVINE LOVE UH AND IT'S MANIFESTING THE POWER OF GOD INTO THE BRIDE BODY OF JESUS CHRIST. I TELL YOU WHAT IT'S DOING. UH as that love is coming upon this BRIDE BODY, THERE IS A SOVEREIGN GRACE UH THAT IS TAKING OVER OUR LIVES. UH THAT WEDDING BAND, A PREDESTINATED UNMMERITED GRACE UH THAT SAID I YOU'RE MINE. YOU'RE MY BRIDE. I'LL NEVER LEAVE YOU. I'LL NEVER FORSAKE YOU. I'LL NEVER LOSE YOU. YOU'RE GOING IN THE RAPTURE. YOUR FAMILY'S GOING IN THE RAPTURE. I BREAK EVERY STRONGHOLD OF HELL IN YOUR LIFE. UH IT IS THE SOVEREIGN GRACE OF GOD moving on the scene in this age. Hallelujah. [cheering] Grace, grace unto the headstone. You see, &gt;&gt; you can't separate love and grace &gt;&gt; because brother Brennham said, "Love and grace are the same thing." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It's just simply divine love &gt;&gt; is what comes to its destination. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Then sovereign grace &gt;&gt; takes his place. I tell you it's grace that has brought us this revelation that YOU CAN BELIEVE NOT IN YOUR WORKS, not in your ability. This is not a denomination. This is not an ecumenical move. This is a moving of the Holy Ghost. AND GOD HAS BROUGHT US TO A FAITH to believe in grace. THERE'S A RAPTURING GRACE. BUT there's a rapturing FAITH IN RAPTURING GRACE. If there's going TO BE A BODY CHANGE, IT'S GOING TO BE GRACE. IF YOU'RE GOING TO MAKE THIS RAPTURE, IT'S GOING TO BE GRACE. UH IF YOUR FAMILY'S GOING TO MAKE THE RAPTURE, IT'S GOING TO BE GRACE. UH IF YOU'RE GOING TO MAKE IT TO INTO TOMORROW, IT'S GOING TO BE GRACE. UH IF YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BE DECEIVED UH BY THE ANTICHRIST SPIRIT OF THE LAST DAYS, IT'S GOING TO BE GRACE. BUT LOVE HAS COME. LOVE HAS COME TO ITS DESTINATION. AND SOVEREIGN GRACE WILL TAKE YOU ON. NOW BELIEVE IT. Believe it. ACT UPON IT. BE SPONTANEOUS. HEALING'S HERE. DELIVERANCE IS HERE. RAPTURE'S HERE. [cheering] IN THE DAY OF MY POWER, THERE WILL BE A LITTLE LADY that realizes who she is. AND SHE'LL REACH OUT AND TOUCH THE HYMN OF HIS GARMENT AS SHE'S PASSING BY. She's recognizing her day [cheering] and her hour of visitation. Brother Brandham says, "We have received the king's message." And then he would say, "This is the lamb's message. King's message &gt;&gt; and the lamb's message &gt;&gt; at the same time. We have received the greatest message that the world has ever heard. Moses would love to be sitting where you're seated. [cheering] DAVID PROPHESIED OF THIS day and he would LONG TO BE SITTING WHERE YOU'RE SEATED. I know you think that you're just a carpenter. Maybe you think that YOU'RE JUST, YOU KNOW, A MAMA. Maybe you think that you're just a computer tech. You're more than that. David would love to take your place. ESTHER WOULD LOVE TO TAKE SHE PROPHESIED OF YOUR POSITION. FOR SUCH A TIME AS THIS, THIS BRIDE HAS COME AS THE MERCY SEAT OF GOD. every type, every shadow prophesied of you. And you're sitting where you're standing. You're sitting where you're sitting because God has chose you to hear the GREATEST MESSAGE OF OMNIPOTENT power of almighty God that the world has ever known. [cheering] Hallelujah. You see, the message is Christ. &gt;&gt; The message is more than just intellects. The message is MORE THAN JUST QUOTES. &gt;&gt; THE MESSAGE IS CHRIST. &gt;&gt; It's the anointed word. Who do you SAY I, THE SON OF MAN, AM? THOU ART THE CHRIST. And Peter, UPON THIS ROCK, I'LL BUILD MY CHURCH. WELL, HE'S BUILT HIS CHURCH. I'M not adding to it, but I'm just TRYING TO SAY IT LIKE THIS. WHO DO YOU SAY I, THE SON OF MAN, AM? THOU ART THE CHRIST. UH UPON THIS CHURCH, UPON THIS ROCK, I BUILT MY CHURCH. AND NOW I'M THE ROCK THAT IS CAPPING THIS CHURCH. [cheering] HALLELUJAH. [screaming] WHO DO YOU SAY I THE THE SON OF MAN AM? THOU ART THE HEADSTONE. THOU ART the revealed word. THOU ART THE SAME YESTERDAY, TODAY, AND FOREVER. PRAISE THE NAME OF THE LORD. WHAT'S HE DOING? HE'S SEALING THE CHURCH. [cheering] It's an age of sealing. The devil can't get to you. YOUR WOMB'S ALREADY SEALED. You say, "BO, BROTHER JONATHAN, YOU DON'T KNOW ME." LET ME JUST SAY THIS. IT DOESN'T MATTER THAT I KNOW YOU. IT'S THAT GOD KNEW YOU. AND BEFORE THE FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD, HE SEALED YOUR WOMB. The devil can't get to you. THE DEVIL CAN'T WORK IN YOUR LIFE. THE DEVIL CAN'T HAVE YOU. YOU'RE ALREADY SEALED. [cheering] &gt;&gt; The greatest love story. &gt;&gt; The greatest message the world's ever heard. &gt;&gt; Christ being preached. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Christ being revealed &gt;&gt; in the last days. &gt;&gt; Expressing love. [screaming] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. THE HOLY GHOST &gt;&gt; TAKING CHARGE OVER the church &gt;&gt; AND JUST INFLUENCING THE CHURCH &gt;&gt; WITH HIS SOVEREIGN grace &gt;&gt; changing our way of thinking. Changing our attitudes, &gt;&gt; changing this slave mentality. [cheering and applause] &gt;&gt; God providing evening time light in Goan to change our attitude, to change how we view life, TO CHANGE HOW WE VIEW OUR S FAMILY SITUATIONS. CREATING CREATION TO LET YOU KNOW THE SUPERNATURAL GODS AMONG US. ONLY OMNIPOTENCE CAN BRING FORTH FLIES. ONLY OMNIPOTENCE, AMEN, CAN BRING FORTH LOCUST.

I I'VE GOT MY COMPLEXES. THE OMNIPOTENCE, THE POWER OF GOD IS HERE TO DELIVER YOU FROM COMPLEX, DELIVER YOU FROM INSECURITIES, to deliver YOU FROM EVERYTHING THE DEVIL'S TRYING TO PUT ON YOUR LIFE. IT'S GRACE. [screaming] [cheering] &gt;&gt; You don't need You don't know my past. I don't need to know your past. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We are preaching a message of divine love. &gt;&gt; We are preaching sovereign grace &gt;&gt; that is the supreme authority &gt;&gt; over every individual situation &gt;&gt; conditional, family, &gt;&gt; church. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We are preaching the uncarchable riches of Christ. For brother Bradom says, "My ministry, &gt;&gt; hallelujah, sir, &gt;&gt; my commission, sir, &gt;&gt; is to introduce you to the coming word." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It's the word. &gt;&gt; We've entered into another age. &gt;&gt; And the prophet says, "It's the word age. &gt;&gt; THIS IS HIS AGE. &gt;&gt; WE'VE had denominational ages, but this is his age. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; WE ARE PREACHING THE UNSEARCHABLE RICHES. &gt;&gt; The depth. Oh, the depth and the riches of the love of God that nothing CAN SEPARATE US FROM GOD'S LOVE. &gt;&gt; Famine can't do it. &gt;&gt; NO. NO. NATIONAL CRISIS CAN DO IT. NO ANTICHRIST SPIRIT REJECTING THE MESSAGE of the hour can do it. &gt;&gt; MAN DIDN'T GIVE ME THIS REVELATION [cheering] AND MAN CAN'T TAKE IT AWAY FROM ME. IT'S GRACE. &gt;&gt; It's grace. Everything that Jesus died for &gt;&gt; is in full effect. &gt;&gt; The title deed that Adam lost &gt;&gt; is back into the hands of the sons and daughters of God. &gt;&gt; Not a partial title deed, &gt;&gt; but the same title deed. &gt;&gt; You say, "Where do you get that?" The message of THE HOUR. GOD SENT A PROPHET IN THIS HOUR, VINDICATED HIM, &gt;&gt; AND THEN SAID, "THE TITLE NEED IS PUT IN YOUR HANDS. &gt;&gt; EVERYTHING THAT ADAM LOST IS IN YOUR HANDS. &gt;&gt; The only thing that WE DON'T HAVE IS THE BODY." BUT IT'S COMING. &gt;&gt; It's coming. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But the grace TO CHANGE MY BODY IS ALREADY HERE. &gt;&gt; And I believe in that grace. [cheering] Praise the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; We have witnessed THE GREATEST VINDICATION OF omnipotence &gt;&gt; the world has ever known. &gt;&gt; When omnipotence speaks, the miraculous takes place. &gt;&gt; The lepers are healed. &gt;&gt; The Lazaruses are raised from the dead. &gt;&gt; Dead churches are brought to revival. FAMILY SITUATIONS ARE CHANGED. IT'S BECAUSE you're not hearing from a man. YOU'RE HEARING FROM THUS SAYAETH THE LORD. [cheering] &gt;&gt; I believe what I'm telling you. &gt;&gt; I believe that when we listen TO THIS MESSAGE AND YOU HEAR YOUR PASTOR PREACH THIS MESSAGE, WE ARE HEARING THE VOICE OF OMNIPOTENCE. WE ARE HEARING, AMEN, A WORD OF POWER RELEASING GRACE INTO YOUR HOME AND YOUR LIFE AND SITUATIONS THAT SEEM IMPOSSIBLE. YET GOD, WHEN HE DROPS THAT REVELATION IN YOUR HEART THAT YES, I BELIEVE THAT THERE'S A [screaming] grace that begins TO MOVE and changes the situations, CHANGES the atmosphere. &gt;&gt; [applause and cheering] &gt;&gt; People have been in drugs for 20 years &gt;&gt; and yet by sovereign grace sir &gt;&gt; completely delivered. &gt;&gt; Alcoholics &gt;&gt; for maybe 30, 40 years totally delivered. &gt;&gt; Marriages falling apart. The devil wreaking havoc. And yet the amen of God comes and says enough. &gt;&gt; I'm the amen over this marriage. HAD THE FINAL SAY over this family. [applause] [cheering] &gt;&gt; It's time that we get our faith where it needs to be and that is the word of omnipotence THAT HAS BROUGHT GRACE. GRACE IN this hour. The opening of the seals was to bring us a faith in rapturing grace. &gt;&gt; I know I I'm quoting to you now. the opening of those seven thunders. Those seven thunders of thunder is the voice of God. Those seven thunders was the mysteries of the seventh seal releasing of faith into this bride THAT YOU'LL REALIZE THERE'S A GRACE. But it's not just any KIND OF A GRACE. UH IT'S A RAPTURING GRACE. UH IT'S A CATCHING AWAY GRACE. UH IT'S A CHAIN BREAKING GRACE. UH IT'S A BULK CUTTING GRACE. UH THERE'S A GRACE UH THAT IS MOVED UPON THIS BRIDE. AND IT'S PROPHESIED THAT IN THIS DAY OF GRACE WHEN THE POWER OF GOD IS REVEALED, THERE WILL BE A PEOPLE THAT WILL STEP INTO IT. THEY'LL BE WILLING TO MOVE, WILLING TO ACT, WILLING TO CLAIM THEIR BIRTHIGHT. WILLING TO SAY, "YES, [screaming] LORD. YES. BY HIS STRIPES, I'M HEALED. YESH. MY FAMILY'S COMING HOME. YES, I'M GOING TO BE CHANGED IN A MOMENT IN THE TWINKLING OF AN EYE. YES. [screaming] [cheering and applause] [cheering] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; OH, how we've heard the voice of omnipotence. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We've heard the king speak himself. &gt;&gt; We're not under an earthbound anointing. &gt;&gt; This is not a REFORMER ANOINTING. THIS IS NOT DEALING WITH YOU ACCORDING to your deeds. &gt;&gt; THE FIRST THREE POWERS WERE earthbound creatures. &gt;&gt; But this is something greater. &gt;&gt; It's going to BE SOMETHING. WE NEED SOMETHING GREATER TO GET US OUT of Leosa. &gt;&gt; Lukewarm, dead, formal, religious. &gt;&gt; And that religious spirit is the greatest spirit to break. BUT THIS EAGLE ANOINTING WILL BREAK IT. [cheering] HALLELUJAH. You can sit in church for 50 years, BUT THIS EAGLE ANOINTING IS WHAT YOU HAVE NEED OF. IT'LL BREAK THE YOLKS. &gt;&gt; It's a IT'S AN ANOINTING &gt;&gt; THAT IS SAYING COME UP HIGHER. IT'S AN ANOINTING &gt;&gt; THAT is you're being magnetized from above. &gt;&gt; The magnetism is from above. &gt;&gt; Look up. &gt;&gt; For your magnetism. &gt;&gt; Look up. [cheering and applause] &gt;&gt; I am he that was. &gt;&gt; I am he that is &gt;&gt; and I am he that is to come. I am the amen of God. &gt;&gt; The magnetism that is DRAWING US TO THE HEADSTONE is coming from above. &gt;&gt; You see, LET ME SAY IT LIKE THE PROPHET. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; He said he went to a factory &gt;&gt; and he said that he seen, you know, the magnet come over and it began to pull all of the shavings that were magnetized &gt;&gt; and it all came to the magnet. &gt;&gt; He the PROPHET SAID, "WELL, WHY WEREN'T THEY MAGNETIZED?" He said, "They're aluminum. THERE'S NOTHING TO PULL, NOTHING TO DRAW THEM." OH, I SEE. BUT WHAT ABOUT THEM? HE SAID, "OH, THEY'RE THE SAME MATERIAL." That's right. But they're bolted down. &gt;&gt; For a long time, I read that &gt;&gt; and I think I may have read it wrong &gt;&gt; because I left them bolted down. &gt;&gt; I kept thinking, "Well, bless their hearts. THEY'RE THE SAME MATERIAL, BUT THEY'RE NOT COMING UP. &gt;&gt; And then when I then I BEGIN TO THINK THIS IS A CYCLE BREAKING MESSAGE. THIS IS A BOLT BREAKING MESSAGE. THIS IS A POWER THAT HAS THE DYNAMICS TO GO AND BEGIN TO CUT AWAY LEAN, CUT AWAY HURT FEELINGS, CUT AWAY PRIDE, CUT AWAY LUKEWARMNESS. GOD'S NOT GOING TO LEAVE YOU IN LEOSIA. GOD'S NOT GOING TO LEAVE YOU IN A HOPELESS CONDITION. GOD'S NOT GOING TO LEAVE YOU NAKED. HE'S COME TO BREAK THE CYCLE. HE'S COME TO BREAK THE GENERATIONAL CURSES, THE THINGS THAT ARE BOLTING YOU DOWN IN YOUR SPIRIT, OF YOUR MEMORIES, OF YOUR PAST. AMEN. THE THE THE THE THINGS IN YOUR IMAGINATION, THE THINGS IN YOUR CONSCIENCE CAUSING YOU TO FALL APART. BUT THIS MESSAGE CAME TO BREAK THE CYCLE, BREAK THE COMPLEXES, TO HEAL THE WOUNDED SPIRITS, TO BREAK THE STRONGHOLDS OF THE DEVIL IN your life. [cheering] I'm &gt;&gt; telling you, we're in a season of grace. &gt;&gt; We're under a different anointing. &gt;&gt; It's a chain breaking anointing. God's grace covenant &gt;&gt; is in full effect. &gt;&gt; Do you believe that &gt;&gt; the power of grace &gt;&gt; is in full effect and will not fail &gt;&gt; to accomplish what he forneew &gt;&gt; and predestinated to be in your life. You see, the prophet of God would say that we are &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; in the dispensation, &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; of the son of man. &gt;&gt; Yes, my brother. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; We've went through the church agesh &gt;&gt; under the dispensation of son of God. &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost moving. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. The lamb interceding on the ignorance of the people &gt;&gt; knowing there would come a time &gt;&gt; that the lamb would take the book open the seals &gt;&gt; and the day of IGNORANCE WOULD BE OPEN would be over. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Because the son of man anointing &gt;&gt; is the revealing of the word. So, as it was in the days of Noah, as it was in the days of Lot, so shall it be in the revealing of the son of man. Who was that son of man? Elohim. &gt;&gt; Elohim come in flesh. [screaming] &gt;&gt; Just a few days before, &gt;&gt; Abram had his name changed from Abram to Abraham. &gt;&gt; Abram had received A PORTION OF GOD'S OWN NAME, &gt;&gt; THE HUM. Elohim Abraham. But he didn't stop there. He said, "I'm going to change Sarah's name, too. &gt;&gt; SHE'S SARAH, &gt;&gt; but now she's going to be called Sarah." &gt;&gt; SARAH'S NAME WAS CHANGED, &gt;&gt; BECAUSE SHE WAS A PART OF ABRAHAM. &gt;&gt; SO, THE SAME PROMISE THAT WAS WITH ABRAHAM WAS ALSO WITH SARAH. Abraham [groaning] was walking with God. Abraham was receiving growing and grace and revelation. BUT THE SAME TIME SARAH, IT LOOKED LIKE NOTHING WAS HAPPENING IN HER LIFE. BUT THROUGH JUSTIFICATION, SANCTIFICATION, the baptism OF THE HOLY GHOST AND THE PROPHET OF GOD SAID THE NAME CHANGE WAS THE ADOPTION. &gt;&gt; So it went from ABRAM TO ABRAHAM. Sarah the whole time it looked like she was in unbelief, &gt;&gt; BUT SHE WAS A PART OF THE ANOINTING. &gt;&gt; WITH EVERY SEASON, SHE WAS CHANGING WITH THE SEASON. It didn't LOOK LIKE IT. IT DIDN'T LOOK LIKE BY HER WORKS, BY HER ABILITY, IT WAS JUST THE SAME OLD SARAI. &gt;&gt; BUT WHEN ELOHIM WAS MADE flesh &gt;&gt; and Abraham recognized [screaming] my Lord, And now Elohim, the son of man, IS SITTING THERE EATING CALF. AMEN. CALF AND AND AND HE'S GOT SOME HE'S GOT SOME GOAT MILK AND HE'S DRINKING IT AND HE'S GOT DUST ALL OVER HIS CLOTHES. AND THEN HE BEGINS to tell Abraham. ABRAHAM, I REMEMBER MY PROMISE. I'VE SWORE BY MYSELF. IT'S A GRACE COVENANT, ABRAHAM. It's not anything OF YOUR WORKS. IT'S NOT ANYTHING OF YOUR ABILITY. I'VE GOT WHAT YOU LACK AND I'VE COME TO VISIT YOU ACCORDING TO THE TIME OF LIFE. [cheering] SARAH [screaming] WAS IN THE tent behind him. And when she heard about that, Amen. She heard what Elohim said. She kind of snickered up her sleeve and said, "ME BEING AN OLD WOMAN HAVE PLEASURE WITH MY HUSBAND, US BEING OLD." AND ELOHIM SAID, "WHY DOES SARAH laugh behind you?" Notice he didn't say Sarah. HE SAID, "SARAH, THY WIFE, WHY DOES SHE LAUGH?" AND WHEN SHE CAME OUT AND SHE SAID, "NO, I DIDN'T LAUGH." THE PROPHET SAID GOD WOULD HAVE KILLED HER RIGHT THERE, BUT SHE WAS A PART OF THE PROMISE. NO ONE COULD TAKE SARAH'S PLACE. [cheering] HALLELUJAH. So Elohim had to HAD TO DECLARE TO SARAH AND PROVE BY VINDICATION THAT SHE IS A PART OF THE PROMISE. AND HE DID IT NOT BY ACCUSING HER, NOT BY CONDEMNING HER, NOT BY BEATING HER DOWN, BUT HE CALLED HER BY HER NAME CHANGE. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. AMEN. TERRY, YOU'RE A PART OF THE PROMISE. NO ONE IS GOING TO TAKE YOUR PLACE. NO ONE CAN TAKE YOUR PLACE. YOU'RE IN THE FORN KNOWLEDGE OF GOD. [applause] [cheering] Let me SAY IT TO YOU LIKE THIS. IF YOU'RE WAITING FOR SOMEONE ELSE TO COME AND be a better church member, IF YOU'RE WAITING FOR SOMEONE ELSE, AMEN, TO FULFILL THE GIFT THAT GOD HAS PLACED IN YOUR LIFE, I'LL TELL YOU WHAT GOD IS WHAT THE PROPHET OF GOD SAYS. HALLELUJAH. IF YOU'LL REALIZE YOUR position &gt;&gt; and if you WILL LET HIM HAVE HAVE HIS POSITION IN YOU. &gt;&gt; OH, HOW YOU'LL SAVE GOD A LOT OF TIME. I TELL YOU, IT'S TIME TO SAVE GOD SOME TIME. AND JUST SAY, LORD JESUS, I AM the sinless, VIRTUOUS BRIDE OF JESUS CHRIST. I AM A PART OF THIS END TIME BRIDE MINISTRY. I AM ANOINTED FOR SUCH A TIME AS THIS UH TO TEAR DOWN UNBELIEF UH TO MOVE BEYOND MY FIVE SENSES OF REASONING AND AFFECTION AND WHAT I SEE AND WHAT I HEAR. I'M ANOINTED TO MANIFEST THIS WORD. [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; The prophet of God in the opening of the seals, he said, "So you'll understand, I'm not going to call you church any longer. I'm going to call you bride. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The name change took place in the opening of the seals. &gt;&gt; But God, &gt;&gt; oh, God's been patient. This season of grace that has been moving over the bride. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. This word THAT HAS BEEN PROPHESIED OVER our lives, God has been growing us, a little changing us, ripening us. The heat of the vindicated sunlight of THE WORD, JUST BAKING ALL THE GREENNESS out of us. Hallelujah. So we can come into the position OF WHO WE TRULY ARE. A POSITION OF SUNSHIP, A POSITION OF SUPREME AUTHORITY, A POSITION THAT I AM HERE TO MANIFEST THE PROMISE. IT'S THE GRACE OF GOD UPON MY LIFE AND NO ONE ELSE CAN [screaming] DO IT BUT ME. [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; This adoption message has been waved over your life for years and years and years. But we are in a season to come into manifestation. We are in a SEASON THAT WE'RE NOT JUST QUESTIONING IT AND WONDERING ABOUT THIS QUOTE WITH THIS QUOTE AND AND AND WELL DOES THIS MEAN THIS AND WE GOT TO ARGUE AND DEBATE. NO SIR, THERE'S A JOSHUA GENERATION THAT SAYS I'VE BEEN RAISED UP TO STEP INTO MY INHERITANCE. UH THIS IS MY PROMISED LAND. UH IT'S MY SEASON. IT'S MY APPOINTED TIME. [cheering and applause] HALLELUJAH. It's a dispensation. &gt;&gt; The prophet of God would say dispensation of son of man, &gt;&gt; but it's also a dispensation of adoption. &gt;&gt; AND THE PROPHET OF GOD SAYS YOUR ADOPTION IS NOT YOUR BIRTH. &gt;&gt; Your adoption is your placing. &gt;&gt; Can you say yes to it? &gt;&gt; Your birth is your rest. &gt;&gt; Rest. &gt;&gt; YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY. &gt;&gt; REST. BUT YOUR ADOPTION IS YOUR POSITIONING. &gt;&gt; SO YOU COME INTO YOUR REST. &gt;&gt; BUT THEN THERE'S a position. &gt;&gt; SO YOU GOT TO COME INTO YOUR POSITION, YOUR PLACING AND SAY, "THIS IS WHO GOD HAS PLACED ME TO BE." SO LET ME JUST SIMPLIFY THIS. THE MESSAGE of the HOUR CAME TO PLACE YOU. &gt;&gt; YOU ARE PLACED AS THE BRIDE OF JESUS CHRIST. YOU ARE PLACED AS AN INVINCIBLE ARMY. YOU ARE PLACED AS A JUSTIFIED ELECT LADY, AS IF YOU HAD NEVER SINNED IN THE FIRST PLACE. YOU ARE PLACED FREE OF FEAR, FREE OF CONDEMNATION, PLACED FREE OF GUILT, PLACED AS ONE OF GOD'S ETERNAL THOUGHTS MADE MANIFEST. THAT'S YOUR POSITION. [applause and cheering] [screaming] And no, no. See, &gt;&gt; see, thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; We're born of the spirit of God. We are sons of God, but we were predestinated. Now, here's what I'm trying to get to you for the sons of the last day. We were predestinated unto adoption. &gt;&gt; So, it's the dispensation of the son of man. &gt;&gt; The revealing, &gt;&gt; it's the dispensation of adoption, your placing, sir. &gt;&gt; But it's also the dispensation of overcoming. When I see of the dispensation of overcoming, I think of Caleb. &gt;&gt; We had heard when when when he and Joshua went to the land of promise, &gt;&gt; my goodness, &gt;&gt; it was everything the prophet said it was. &gt;&gt; It was flowing with milk and honey and sir, &gt;&gt; oh, the the fruits were Amen. in full bloom. Hallelujah. They were carrying back the evidence. It's a good land. &gt;&gt; They were partaking of the grapes and the pomegranates and &gt;&gt; they HAD GRAPE JUICE RUNNING ALL over their face. They were just full. THEY WERE JUST IN THEY THEY WERE THEY WERE ELATED &gt;&gt; FULL OF THE EMOTION THAT THE HOLY GHOST GAVE. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. Coming back and saying yes sir. The healing is mine. Joy is mine. Victory is mine. My family is mine. The rapture is mine. &gt;&gt; THEY BEGIN TO SHOUT BECAUSE THEY WERE RIGHT SMACK dab in the bride's revival and all they had to do is take it as an inheritance. &gt;&gt; They seen the same walled cities. They seen the same giants, but they didn't even look at them. You know what they said? &gt;&gt; They're not even in the eternal thoughts of God. &gt;&gt; And God has already told me that this is my land. &gt;&gt; And I was here before the foundation of the world. God created this land of the Holy Ghost. AND IT'S MINE. IT'S MY INHERITANCE. &gt;&gt; And all I've got to DO IS JUST STEP INTO it as an inheritance. Don't have to beg. Don't have to plead. don't have to WORK A REVIVAL UP. ALL I'VE got to do is just step into it and say, "Joy is mine. Peace is mine. Happiness is mine. FAITH, VIRTUE, KNOWLEDGE, TEMPERANCE, PATIENCE, BROTHERLY KINDNESS, GODLINESS, ALL OF THESE THINGS, IT IS MINE." [screaming] &gt;&gt; WELL, GLORY, GLORY, GLORY. &gt;&gt; And there they are. They're carrying the evidence. And then they start hearing an evil report. &gt;&gt; It's not for us. &gt;&gt; IT'S A GOOD LAND, BUT IT'S NOT FOR US. &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT FOR MY CHILDREN. &gt;&gt; MY CHILDREN IS GOING TO GET SWALLOWED UP. &gt;&gt; WE NEED SOMETHING BETTER. We need ANOTHER PROGRAM. WE WE NEED PSYCHOLOGY. WE WE NEED SOMETHING ELSE TO HELP OUR FAMILIES. &gt;&gt; WELL, praise the NAME OF THE LORD. [screaming] I DON'T KNOW FOR YOU, but that's an evil report. &gt;&gt; EVERYTHING I HAVE NEED OF IS CHRIST. AND AND THIS MESSAGE IS CHRIST. AND THIS MESSAGE HAS JOY. IT HAS PEACE. IT IS FULL OF NEW WINE. IT IS IT IS THE STIMULATION OF REVELATION FOR MY BLUES. IT IS RAPTURING GRACE. [cheering] Glory to God. Joshua and Caleb &gt;&gt; silenced the people &gt;&gt; and said, "Don't do this." &gt;&gt; Let me just put IT TO OUR MODERN WAY. DON'T DO THIS. &gt;&gt; It's an antichrist spirit. &gt;&gt; THAT IS A FALSE ANOINTING. &gt;&gt; TRYING TO TURN YOUR HEARTS TO UNBELIEF. &gt;&gt; IT'S A GOOD LAND. HERE'S THE EVIDENCE. HE'S ONLY LOOKING FOR A HEART OF FAITH TO SAY, "WE'RE MORE THAN ABLE TO POSSESS THE LAND. 40 years. &gt;&gt; 40 years. &gt;&gt; God said &gt;&gt; that every one of you is going to die in the wilderness except Joshua and Caleb because they had a right spirit. &gt;&gt; He said the children that you said would fall prey. &gt;&gt; They're the ones that's going to possess it. &gt;&gt; I tell you, we've had a generation of old fighters. But let me tell you something, friends. &gt;&gt; Caleb was an old man when he took this took that mountain. &gt;&gt; I believe that there's an old gener there's that old generation that has stood with this message that you don't HAVE TO GET A COMPLEX WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT THOSE old fighters. BUT I'M HERE TO TELL YOU THERE ARE SOME THERE IS SOME WARRIORS THAT HAS STOOD WITH THIS MESSAGE THAT HAS BEEN WAITING FOR A FRESH GENERATION IN THE SEASON OF RESTITUTION OF ALL THINGS. THERE WOULD BE A GENERATION RISE UP THAT IS FLEXIBLE TO THE MOVING OF THE HOLY GHOST THAT CAN BEGIN TO CLAP THEIR HANDS TO THE WORD AND SAY YES LORD. YES, LORD. UH, MILK AND HONEY, LORD, IT'S MY INHERITANCE. UH, AMEN. THOSE CITIES IS MY INHERITANCE. UH, OH THOSE THOSE JOY AND THE PEACE AND ALL OF THIS IS MY REVIVAL. [screaming] [cheering] I'M TELLING YOU FRIENDS, WE'VE TURNED THE CORNER. IT'S A SEASON OF GRACE. IT'S TIME TO OVERCOME [screaming] IN THE PROMISED LAND. [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; Caleb began to look around. &gt;&gt; He's watching. &gt;&gt; He's watching this family conquer. &gt;&gt; He's saying, "Glory to God. &gt;&gt; That's the revival we're in." &gt;&gt; Looks around and sees that family conquer. that tribe conquer. &gt;&gt; He's amen. They've all got their swords in hand saying, "Greater is he that is in me &gt;&gt; than he that is in the world." &gt;&gt; Something begin to bubble up in his heart. &gt;&gt; And he said, Joshua, &gt;&gt; Joshua's a type of the Holy Ghost. Now, &gt;&gt; it's a type of the grace dispensation. &gt;&gt; Moses was a type of law. &gt;&gt; Law had passed away. Denominational ages passed away. And now God's provided play God's provided place of worship. God's provided way of worship is completely open. &gt;&gt; AND JOSHUA HAS LED HIM INTO IT. &gt;&gt; This is where the giants fall. &gt;&gt; This is where deliverance takes place. Amen. &gt;&gt; In that place, &gt;&gt; in that position, &gt;&gt; IN THAT DISPENSATION OF ADOPTION, &gt;&gt; WHERE MECHANICS and dynamics HAVE COME TOGETHER, IN THAT PLACE, I MEET YOU. [cheering] THAT'S WHERE RESTORATION TAKES PLACE. THAT'S WHERE MARRIAGES ARE RESTORED. THAT'S WHERE DRUG ADDICTS, SONS, OR DAUGHTERS COME HOME. &gt;&gt; NOT BY YOUR WORKS. BUT BY MY SPIRIT, SAITH THE LORD, [cheering and applause] &gt;&gt; CALEB. YES, SIR. Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Caleb had to wait a long time, &gt;&gt; but now Caleb, &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; is a part of a new generation. &gt;&gt; They've come into the promised land. They believe the report, the arm of the Lord has been revealed. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And Caleb, &gt;&gt; he's different &gt;&gt; because he's a gentile, &gt;&gt; he's a gentile, and somehow he had found his place in the inheritance of Israel, &gt;&gt; a part of the adoption &gt;&gt; and he had a different spirit. He believed the word of God. &gt;&gt; When Caleb &gt;&gt; came to Joshua and said, "Now Joshua, &gt;&gt; we need to have a conference. I think I I I think some of us just need to go to the Holy GHOST AND SAY, "HOLY GHOST, &gt;&gt; we need a conference. [cheering] I've heard the tapes. &gt;&gt; I know what the spirit of grace has spoke to my heart. &gt;&gt; AND THE PROPHET SAID, "THAT'S MY INHERITANCE." &gt;&gt; NOW, JOSHUA, &gt;&gt; I'm just as capable. &gt;&gt; I'M JUST AS STRONG THE DAY that that that that THE PROPHET SPOKE THAT PROMISE TO ME. &gt;&gt; AND I HAVE GOT THE STRENGTH TO GO and conquer. and I've got the strength to return. In other words, those giants doesn't have ENOUGH TO DESTROY MY LIFE. THEY DON'T HAVE ENOUGH TO DESTROY MY HOME. THEY DON'T HAVE ENOUGH TO TAKE my joy. [cheering and applause] &gt;&gt; I THINK WE JUST NEED TO HAVE A GOOD OLD-FASHIONED HOLY GHOST MOVE AND SAY, "SATAN, YOU DON'T HAVE ENOUGH. You tried to TAKE MY FAMILY, BUT YOU DON'T HAVE ENOUGH. YOU TRIED TO TAKE MY HEALTH, BUT YOU DON'T HAVE ENOUGH. AMEN. AMEN. WHERE WERE YOU? AMEN. AMEN. A YEAR AGO WHEN THE DEVIL SAID YOU'RE NOT GOING TO MAKE IT ANOTHER YEAR, BUT YOU'RE HERE BY THE GRACE OF GOD. WHAT ABOUT AMEN. 10 YEARS AGO WHEN YOU WERE TRAPPED IN SIN, TRAPPED IN DRUGS, TRAPPED IN ALCOHOL, AND THE DEVIL SAID YOU'RE MINE, YOU'RE NEVER GOING TO GET FREE, BUT YOU'RE HERE IN YOUR RIGHT MIND, IN YOUR POSITION, STANDING AS CALEB'S. IT'S TIME TO SAY, SATAN, YOU DON'T HAVE ENOUGH. YOU CAN'T TAKE ME. YOU CAN'T DEFEAT ME. YOU CAN'T TAKE MY FAMILY. YOU CAN'T TAKE MY JOY. YOU CAN'T TAKE MY RAPTURE. YOU CAN'T TAKE MY MARRIAGE UP. YOU CAN'T TAKE MY MILLENNIUM. YOU CAN'T TAKE ETERNAL LIFE. [applause and cheering] I think it's TIME TO TELL THE DEVIL THAT I'M GOING TO BE THERE and I'm GOING TO BE THE ONE THAT TAKES YOUR SCRAWNY NECK AND I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU THE BOOT INTO THE lake of fire. HALLELUJAH. IT'S MY POSITION. IT'S MY SUPREME AUTHORITY. &gt;&gt; [cheering] &gt;&gt; BUT I'M NOT GOING TO WAIT FOR THAT DAY. I'M GOING TO CAST YOU OUT. I speak peace. I SPEAK JOY. I SPEAK DELIVERANCE. I SPEAK HEALING. I SAY THIS IS NOT BY MIGHT. THIS IS NOT BY POWER. THIS IS NOT A PREACHER'S REVIVAL. THIS IS A BRIDE'S REVIVAL. THIS IS A BRIDE AGE. [screaming] IT'S YOUR SEASON OF GRACE TO CONQUER THAT ENEMY. [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. [screaming] &gt;&gt; You know what Caleb did? &gt;&gt; He acted on the promise. &gt;&gt; An 85, I believe it was, 85y old man &gt;&gt; was willing in the day of God's power. I tell you, &gt;&gt; I don't have time to get into all of these things. &gt;&gt; But I I let Let me just tell you about another battle. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; When Joshua was leading &gt;&gt; his army. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And now now this is the season of adoption, right? Dispensation of adoption. &gt;&gt; And God said, "It's time, Joshua. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Take them on into it." &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Well, I tell you, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. The prophet of God had a vision &gt;&gt; and he seen a map of Palestine. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And he said, "You come twothirds of the journey, &gt;&gt; the first two pools." &gt;&gt; WE DIDN'T HAVE A PART IN THOSE first two pools. &gt;&gt; I'M NOT TRYING TO REPRODUCE THE first two pools. &gt;&gt; But when God told his prophet said, "It's now time to go into the fullness." go into the full manifestation of the covenant word. &gt;&gt; It's time TO MAKE THE WORD EFFECTIVE IN THE HEARTS OF THE PEOPLE. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; ARE YOU HEARING ME? &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; IT'S TIME TO COME INTO THE THIRD POOL, &gt;&gt; THE OPENING OF THE WORD WHERE ALL THE PROMISES ARE. AND THE PROPHET UNDER THE JOSHUA MINISTRY, A SON OF MAN, REVEALING THE SON OF MAN, LED US INTO THE PROMISE AND SAID, "IT'S YOUR LAND. IT'S YOUR INHERITANCE." [applause and cheering] THEN GOD TOOK THE PROPHET OFF OF THE SCENE, BUT HE LEFT US WITH THE GREATEST MESSAGE OF OMNIPOTENCE THE WORLD HAS ever known. And now there's a PEOPLE IN THIS SEASON SAYING, "YES, IT'S MINE. [screaming] I SEE IT. I SEE IT. MY EYES ARE OPEN. THE EYES OF MY UNDERSTANDING IS OPEN. [cheering] &gt;&gt; I'm not trying to hype you up. I'm trying to tell you the season you're in. [cheering] &gt;&gt; You see [cheering] &gt;&gt; as they stepped into the into that new dispensation turned the corner. THE DENOMINATION JUST KEPT ON GOING. &gt;&gt; Pentecostals just went RIGHT ON DOWN THE LINE. &gt;&gt; BUT THE BRIDE ALL OF A SUDDEN TURNED THE corner &gt;&gt; and they went right into battles. All of the forces, &gt;&gt; ALL OF HELL, &gt;&gt; HELL &gt;&gt; HAS BEEN released &gt;&gt; because they recognize something. Satan has recognized THAT THIS IS HIS TIME TO STRIP WOMEN. IT'S HIS TIME TO TAKE SANITY AND MAKE THEM INSANE. HE SEES IT'S HIS TIME TO WORK IN POLITICS AND NATION AGAINST NATION. IT'S HIS TIME. &gt;&gt; But by A VINDICATED WORD, PROPHET, THIS BRIDE IS RECOGNIZED. IT'S BRIDE TIME. [cheering] DON'T RUN FROM THE DEVIL. PUT YOUR SHOULDERS BACK. YOU'RE PREDESTINATED FOR THIS SEASON. YOU'RE PREDESTINATED FOR ADOPTION. YOU'RE PREDESTINATED FOR THIS MOUNTAIN DRAW MOUNT TREETOP WHERE THE SUNLIGHT IS RIPENING THE FRUIT. &gt;&gt; WHAT IS THE FRUIT? THE MESSAGE OF THE HOUR [screaming] MADE FLESH. [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; Don't think me crazy, &gt;&gt; BUT I AM [screaming] THE WORD. &gt;&gt; [cheering] &gt;&gt; I AM THE DWELLING PLACE OF CHRIST. &gt;&gt; I AM [screaming] &gt;&gt; MESSIAH. [cheering] &gt;&gt; Don't you know that the law says that to whom the word has come to, ye are gods? &gt;&gt; And the PROPHET OF GOD SAYS, "YOU are miniature creators." &gt;&gt; WHAT ARE YOU CREATING? WE don't need squirrels. We don't need to speak a storm out of existence. WE NEED A HOLY GHOST ATMOSPHERE. BECAUSE IT'S NOT BY MIGHT, IT'S NOT BY POWER, BUT IT'S BY MY SPIRIT, SAYETH THE LORD. WE NEED TO CREATE AN ATMOSPHERE OF BELIEVING THAT ALL THINGS ARE POSSIBLE. WHEN WE'RE IN THE HEAT OF THE BATTLE, WE CAN RECOGNIZE WE'RE UNDER ANOTHER DISPENSATION. spontaneous &gt;&gt; in the heat of the battle, &gt;&gt; but was in &gt;&gt; it was when the shadows were falling. &gt;&gt; It was when sir &gt;&gt; it was becoming a dismal day. &gt;&gt; It was when sir &gt;&gt; Joshua understood that the forces were going to gather all together against Israel. &gt;&gt; So something in him Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Spontaneous. &gt;&gt; He didn't pray about it. &gt;&gt; He didn't have a 40-day fast. &gt;&gt; He didn't say, "God, is this your will? Can I speak?" &gt;&gt; He just SIMPLY SAID, "SON, STAND STILL. MOON, you stay in your place on Agelon." &gt;&gt; What was he doing? He was A SON OF GOD THAT WAS ANOINTED TO LEAD THEM INTO THE PROMISED LAND. AND HE SPOKE THERE SHALL BE LIGHT IN THE EVENING TIME [applause and cheering] AND THE BIBLE SAYS THAT THERE WAS NOT A DAY LIKE IT from that time AND THERE'S NOT BEEN A DAY LIKE IT SINCE &gt;&gt; BUT I JUST WANT TO SAY LIKE THIS PSALMS 118 verse 22- 24 THE STONE WHICH THE BUILDERS refused has become the headstone OF THE CORNER THIS IS THE LORD'S DOING IT'S MARVELOUS IS IN OUR EYES WHOSE EYES OUR EYES. THIS IS THE DAY WHICH THE LORD HATH MADE. We will rejoice and be glad in it. This is not man's day. This is the Lord's day. THE SAME DAY THERE'S GROSS DARKNESS. THE SAME DAY judgment has been pronounced OVER THIS OVER THIS NATION, OVER THE WORLD. THEY'RE IN THE spirit of tribulation. &gt;&gt; BUT THE SAME DAY, GOD HAS MADE A BRIGHT AGE. HE'S MADE A DAY TO REVEAL HIS POWER THAT THE VINDICATED SUNLIGHT OF THE WORD MADE MANIFEST COULD SHINE OVER THIS END TIME PRIDE THAT YOU COULD DO BATTLE AGAINST YOUR ENEMY. &gt;&gt; I'm closing for LISTEN NOW. WE ARE DEALING with a defeated enemy. [cheering] &gt;&gt; DO YOU BELIEVE IT? THE MIGHTY CONQUEROR &gt;&gt; HAS ALREADY CONQUERED DEATH, HELL, AND THE GRAVE. &gt;&gt; HE'S BEEN STRIPPED OF ALL OF HIS POWER. [applause and cheering] &gt;&gt; The prophet of GOD WOULD SAY IT LIKE THIS. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; He would say, &gt;&gt; "We Amen. We are dealing with a defeated enemy." &gt;&gt; And doomed devils are on the run. Glory to God. &gt;&gt; The sun is still shining. &gt;&gt; He tried to hide, but the sun's still shining. &gt;&gt; He tried to gather forces against you, but the sun's still shining. [cheering] &gt;&gt; WHAT IS LIGHT? THE WORD made manifest is light. AND THE SAME LIFE THAT HAS EXPOSED THE DEVIL &gt;&gt; is the same life that has ripened you to maturity. [cheering] &gt;&gt; SO YOU HAVE COME TO A PERFECT FAITH &gt;&gt; IN THE PERFECT WORD OF GOD. WHAT IS PERFECT FAITH? JUST SIMPLY SAYING I am healed. &gt;&gt; I am I am delivered. &gt;&gt; JUST SIMPLY SAYING WHAT IS ALREADY WROTE. It's a confession. JUST CONFESSING WHAT HE ALREADY SAID. THAT'S PERFECT FAITH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; JUST A SIMPLE FAITH THAT GOD SAID IT. I BELIEVE IT. It's settled. [cheering] [applause] THE PROPHET OF GOD SAYS HE'S A DOOMED DEVIL. HE'S ALREADY DEFEATED. AND THEN HE SAID, "LOOK, I SEE HIS TAIL LIGHTS GO OVER THE HILL. [screaming] I SEE HIS RED TAIL LIGHTS GO OVER THE HILL." WELL, I TELL YOU, FRIENDS, THAT'S MORE THAN JUST BACK THEN. I SAY HE'S STILL ON THE RUN. [cheering and applause] &gt;&gt; I SAY HE'S NOTHING BUT A BLUFF. &gt;&gt; I KNOW THE DEVIL KEEPS TRYING to say you're the bluff. &gt;&gt; He takes those quotes and said, "Now, you can't bluff it now. You either got to have it or you don't." &gt;&gt; And the devil tries to talk you out of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; TRIES TO TALK YOU OUT OF your redemptive rights. &gt;&gt; But we're in ANOTHER SEASON. &gt;&gt; WE'RE NOT JUST CHILDREN ANY LONGER. WE'RE WE'RE SPEAKING AS GROWN MEN. &gt;&gt; WE'RE SPEAKING AS REVELATED SONS AND DAUGHTERS OF GOD WHO KNOWS WHO WE ARE AND SEES OUR POSITION ACCORDING TO THE MESSAGE OF THE HOUR. [cheering] &gt;&gt; WHAT'S MY POSITION? I'M A BELIEVER. [cheering] &gt;&gt; I BELIEVE THIS WORD. I BELIEVE THIS MESSAGE. THAT'S MY POSITION. MAS, THAT'S YOUR POSITION. DADDIES, IT'S YOUR POSITION. PREACHERS, IT'S YOUR POSITION. &gt;&gt; NOW, now the prophet of God says, "Now we had the devil on the run." &gt;&gt; He said, "Now the problem with this last revival, that Pentecostal revival, &gt;&gt; he says we did not." He said, "We led off." &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. &gt;&gt; We had him on the run. &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. &gt;&gt; He said, "And we let up." &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. &gt;&gt; He said, "Now that was the problem with that last revival." That's right. &gt;&gt; Well, I just want to tell you this, sir. &gt;&gt; Cuz the word come to correct the error. &gt;&gt; And every revival had a cycle &gt;&gt; of of of life and death. Life and death. Life and death. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I just want to say this in this bride's revival. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; That I am determined. &gt;&gt; I I I I have taken an oath by the grace of God &gt;&gt; that I'm not going to let up one iota. I'm going to preach this message with everything that is within me. &gt;&gt; I'm going to wave the this I'm going to wave this vindicated promises of God over the bride of Jesus Christ. And I'm going to keep the devil on THE RUN. &gt;&gt; I DECLARE WE'VE GOT HIM ON THE RUN AGAIN. And I declare THAT I HAVE MY SWORD DRAWN. AND I'M JOINING WITH YOUR PASTOR WITH THESE OTHER BROTHERS. AND I JUST SAY, "MOMAS, YOU'VE GOT A RIGHT TO FIGHT. DADDIES, YOU'VE GOT A RIGHT [screaming] TO FIGHT. CHURCH OF THE LIVING GOD. DON'T JUST LEAVE IT TO THE PROPHET FIGHTING FOR FOR TO GIVE GOD A FRESH DRINK OF PENTECOSTAL WATER. YOU FIGHT. &gt;&gt; YOU FIGHT THE GOOD FIGHT. &gt;&gt; People are so fearful. And I'm closing. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says the word corrects the error. &gt;&gt; Remember he shot that 22 and he got it nine times in the same hole. &gt;&gt; And then and then he got an affidava what took place and then it went off and he couldn't understand it. Y'all remember that? &gt;&gt; He took a he sent it back to Winchester and they said, "Ah, it's a it's it's only good for 25 yards. It's just a little plinkster." But uh Mr. Brandom And brother Brand said, "But I I proved it. &gt;&gt; I shot it at 50 yards in the same hole and it hit it every time." &gt;&gt; His wife said, "Why? Why can't you just simply be satisfied with what the people who who who made the gun? &gt;&gt; Why can't you just BELIEVE WHAT THEY SAID?" HE SAID, "Because I proved it." &gt;&gt; He said he went hunting and all the other brothers could shoot the squirrel anywhere, you know. You know, they could get up and preach a sermon and it sounded good, &gt;&gt; but it would hit here and hit there and hit there. And brother Bam says, you know, I'm not satisfied with those denominational teachings and ideals of man. And &gt;&gt; so he said, I'm sitting there, I'm leaning up against a tree and I'm crying. He said, why am I such a baby? and I why have you made me this way? Why can't I be like the other brothers? &gt;&gt; And about that time, God spoke to him and said, I made you thus. &gt;&gt; He said, because you know, if it hit it the if you hit it in the mark the target once, it'll do it again. &gt;&gt; If you hit it in the bullseye once, it'll do it again. If you aimed at the eyeball, and you hit it, it'll do it again. &gt;&gt; That's it. And you know that if Peter preached this and it hit the target and you preach it again, it'll do it again. &gt;&gt; If you preach what Paul preached, it'll produce the same effects. &gt;&gt; Well, praise the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You see, the prophet of God was correcting the error where they went off. The message of the hour was meeting the challenge of the age. The prophet OF GOD SAID THE CHALLENGE WAS DEALING with that uninspired leadership that was keeping the people so far below their privileges that they couldn't LIFT THEIR HEAD UP AND believe for even for A HEADACHE HARDLY THEY LET ALONE RAPTURING FAITH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; But the prophet of God says you got to you got to start stop living below your privileges. &gt;&gt; You got to realize WHO YOU ARE NOW. YE ARE THE SONS OF GOD. NOT GOING TO BE, BUT YOU ALREADY ARE THE SONS OF GOD. NOW REALIZE WHO YOUR WHERE YOUR POSITION IS. SEE YOUR PLACE IN THE WORD. Just as THE BRIDEGROOM CAME TO FULFILL THE Old Testament AND HE'S SEEN IN THE OLD TESTAMENT WHO HE WAS, SO THE BRIDE HAS COME AT THE END TIME TO FULFILL THE NEW TESTAMENT. SHE SEES HER POSITION IN THE WORD. the prophet in the message of grace. &gt;&gt; Now, if you haven't heard that in a while, uh it'd do you good, I think, to just go back and listen to that message of grace. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon gives us some before he starts his sermon and starts reading there in Zechariah the 4th chapter of Azerubable. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. He takes us to three rainbows he's seen while he &gt;&gt; he's in the woods and it's still dark and &gt;&gt; and it's rainy and he sees three rainbows coming up. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And and and they're coming up, you know, and and and and then he's and then he turns and he sees Amen. It's it's like God brings his attention to a tree down the way and he goes to that tree and it's the same same place that just a year before he spoke squirrels into existence and the prophet of God is meditating upon that and describes the tree and and and if you remember the first time it happened brother Brandham was talking he was thinking about the scripture if you say into this mountain &gt;&gt; that's exactly right &gt;&gt; and he was thinking about how sir &gt;&gt; how how could it be that a man &gt;&gt; this was before the atonement &gt;&gt; not if I say but if you say &gt;&gt; that's exactly &gt;&gt; and then it took him back to Moses and how that Moses spoke creation into existence &gt;&gt; and then all of a sudden that voice a voice began to talk to him and and take him through all of these things and you know and Moses and on and then he says now what do you have need of &gt;&gt; and how that brother Brandham got excited Remember that he spun around and said, "Who? Who's there? Who am I talking to?" &gt;&gt; And then God spoke back. &gt;&gt; I'm the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. And understood who he was in the presence of omnipotence. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; And then he tells him, "What do you have need of?" And brother Brandham couldn't think of anything. So he said, "Well, you need game, don't you?" &gt;&gt; He said, "There was no squirrels anywhere." &gt;&gt; That's exactly right. He said, "But he spoke and he said, and and there was a young red squirrel and and how the brother Brandon was still he got so e excited and and so caught up and like like is this really happening?" &gt;&gt; And and then the squirrel came and and remember he shot and he missed it &gt;&gt; because he got ahead of where he said it was going to be. &gt;&gt; Exactly right. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; And now here he IS IN THAT SAME VOICE. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; THE SAME POSITION. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; And he's saying, "What do you have need of?" He said, "Oh," he said, "Just, you know, the same amount as last time, the limit." &gt;&gt; He said, "I no longer had said that." Then I said, "Now," he said, "I was in a swarm of mosquitoes and I said, now not one of them will bother me the rest of the day." He said, "And then the sun is going to shine in 30 minutes." He said, "And I'll have my limit by 10:00." He said, "Every one of those things happened, I have my limit by 3 minutes till 10:00." &gt;&gt; He said, "As soon as I said that," he said, "I heard a chatter chatter and I turned around and there was a red young squirrel 70 yards away." He said, "I put up my rifle and he said, I could barely even see through that powerful scope. I could barely see its eyeball." He said, "But I just no more than just aimed above it and I pulled the trigger and it hit it right in the eyeball." &gt;&gt; How did the prophet know? &gt;&gt; So relaxed, &gt;&gt; not nervous. He knew what was happening. &gt;&gt; You see, he had been there. He had already had that experience. &gt;&gt; And he knew. How did he know exactly that? All he had to do was just not even aim, &gt;&gt; just simply put the gun above the squirrel &gt;&gt; and pull the trigger. &gt;&gt; And the bullet knew exactly where to hit. &gt;&gt; Now, he didn't say, "I'm going to put the gun above it. I'm going to aim two inches above it. It's going to be like this. It's going to be like this. And then I'm going to hit." He didn't say that. He just said, &gt;&gt; he just spoke it and then the Holy Ghost got a hold of it. &gt;&gt; You see, I immediately began to think of how that there was another example of that &gt;&gt; and how that there was an anointed little boy &gt;&gt; that had been overlooked by all of his brethren and all the great men of battle. &gt;&gt; He was just put on the back side of the desert with the sheep. &gt;&gt; Right. Amen. &gt;&gt; But there was a lion and a bear that rose up and &gt;&gt; he got that slingshot and he beat that lion, slung that stone and hit the line, hit the bear and then he grabbed a hold of it and killed it with his knife. &gt;&gt; As he come into the battle, he's seeing his brethren and they're all hiding, discouraged. For 40 days, they'd heard the boast of a giant. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Calling them the armies of Saul. Come and fight me. Bring a champion. The armies of Saul. Do you see when you leave the pillar of fire &gt;&gt; and you leave the voice of omnipotence? &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You're under another headship. &gt;&gt; All of them others were being identified. And you know what? They had to sit there and take it &gt;&gt; for 40 days. That giant said, "You armies of Saul." Yeah. &gt;&gt; But when David showed up, &gt;&gt; he said, "Who is that uncircumcised Philistine that he would challenge the armies of the living God?" &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You see, the revelation, &gt;&gt; we're not under man. &gt;&gt; We're under the divine leadership of Almighty God. &gt;&gt; THE PILLAR OF FIRE IS MORE than just a picture &gt;&gt; over over that prophet. But that pillar of fire accompanies the message always. And this message is in you, in you, in you. AND WHEREVER [screaming] YOU GO, CHRIST is &gt;&gt; all of a sudden David &gt;&gt; said, "I'll go fight that giant." &gt;&gt; And he began to dance. Now, this is what the prophet said. He danced all all the way down to that brook. And he got five stones. And then and then he danced all the way to to that giant. And the prophet of God said he had already seen by faith that giant falling and he took his head off. &gt;&gt; Already saw it. So dancing is a sign of victory. And he was not defeated. He was going to battle with the revelation that he was fighting FROM THE POSITION OF VICTORY. I tell you, BRIDE OF JESUS CHRIST, whether you can see it now OR WHETHER YOU'LL SEE IT TOMORROW or a month from now, BUT YOU ARE THE BRIDE OF Jesus Christ. You are the elect lady. You are an invincible army. And it's time that you recognize that your position, YOU ARE NOT FIGHTING FOR VICTORY. YOU ARE FIGHTING FROM THE POSITION OF VICTORY. [cheering] AND THE DEVIL IS NO MATCH FOR YOU. SO YOU CAN GO AHEAD AND DANCE. [cheering and applause] YOU CAN PUT THAT CONFESSION IN THE SLINGSHOT OF YOUR MOUTH AND YOU CAN GO AHEAD AND SPEAK. [screaming] &gt;&gt; I AM HEALED. I AM RAPTURED. I AM DELIVERED. [cheering] &gt;&gt; The whole time Goliath is making his boast, laughing. You sent a scrawny, ruddy little boy to FIGHT ME. BUT WHAT HE DIDN'T KNOW IS THIS IS THE MINISTRY OF ZERUBABLE. IT'S A MESSAGE OF GRACE. IT'S NOT BY MIGHT. IT'S NOT BY POWER, BUT IT'S BY MY SPIRIT, saith the Lord. AND THE PROPHET OF GOD SAYS THE HOLY GHOST GOT A HOLD OF THAT STONE AND IT THAT STONE WENT A THOUSAND MILES a second. AND IT HIT BETWEEN THE ARMOR, THE ONLY PLACE IT COULD HIT. HOW DID DAVID KNOW IT? HE KNEW THAT HE WAS NOT FIGHTING ON [screaming] HIS OWN. IT WAS NOT HIS ABILITY, BUT HE WAS OVERCOMING IN THE SEASON OF GRACE. HE WAS ANOINTED, ANOINTED IN THE SEASON OF GRACE [screaming] TO DESTROY THE YOLKS OF THE DEVIL. [cheering and applause] [cheering] &gt;&gt; The stone is confession. I know it looks I know it looks crazy. &gt;&gt; It may even look crazy to your family, &gt;&gt; but if you've got a wavered son or a daughter, go ahead and speak it. They're saved. They may be drug addicts, but they're coming home. They're coming home. What are you doing? upon the authority of the vindicated spoken word of omnipotence. You are confessing the same thing THAT HAS BEEN PROVEN OVER AND OVER AND OVER &gt;&gt; AND THE HOLY GHOST. &gt;&gt; YOU SPEAK IT AND THE HOLY GHOST GETS A HOLD OF IT. [cheering] It'll hit the mark. &gt;&gt; Are you HEARING ME? &gt;&gt; QUIT TRYING TO FIGURE IT OUT. &gt;&gt; QUIT TRYING TO CALCULATE THE QUOTES. &gt;&gt; JUST SPEAK the quotes. [cheering] &gt;&gt; David already knew. It was time-tested, time-tested testimonies. He already knew the effects, the lion and the bear. And he SAID, "YOU'RE GOING TO BE LIKE ONE OF THOSE, AND I'M GOING TO TAKE YOUR HEAD OFF." AND THEN HE WENT FORWARD to make IT HAPPEN. &gt;&gt; HE SPOKE it &gt;&gt; and then he ran to make it good. &gt;&gt; Friends, the Let the musicians come, friends. The prophet of God said, "If there's ever a time to speak, &gt;&gt; it's now." [cheering and applause] &gt;&gt; David didn't have to get prayed up. The prophet of God says God got him prayed up before the foundation of the world &gt;&gt; of God. &gt;&gt; If there is ever a time &gt;&gt; to realize &gt;&gt; that the only ones that can use this word &gt;&gt; to kill the enemy &gt;&gt; is this elect lady. &gt;&gt; You're elected for it. &gt;&gt; Five stars aligned in 62. And the prophet of God says it's grace. &gt;&gt; And the power of God has begun to fall upon this bride. Friends, we're no longer just an infant bride. We are a bride that has come into position. &gt;&gt; A mature a mature bride. We're not just fighting with quotes any longer. &gt;&gt; We're putting our the quotes in our mouth. We're convinced. &gt;&gt; We're convinced. I honestly I I I am taking too much liberty. &gt;&gt; When it comes to this message, &gt;&gt; you can take it &gt;&gt; or you can leave it. &gt;&gt; But as for me, I'm convinced. [cheering] &gt;&gt; It's the answer for my children, my wife, my home. It's my rapture. I'm convinced. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. If you want to talk, I'll talk. But I'm not going. You're I I'm already convinced. &gt;&gt; IT IS THUS SAYAITH THE LORD FOR MY LIFE. Supreme authority. &gt;&gt; I've already seen the miraculous. I've already seen the vindication. I've already seen deliverances take place. HEALINGS TAKE PLACE. MIRACLES TAKE PLACE. CANCERS DROP OFF. BLIND EYES OPEN. BUT I'VE SEEN THE GREATEST MIRACLE. LIVES THAT THE DEVIL HAD DESTROYED. AND GOD RESTORED THEM BACK TO THEIR RIGHT MINDS. FILL THEM WITH THE HOLY GHOST. &gt;&gt; It's a living word. &gt;&gt; I'll just say what the prophet of God said about it. I'm riding on it. &gt;&gt; I I'm not fighting with it. I'm riding on it. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Step into it. &gt;&gt; The angel of the Lord has stirred the waters. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. step into it &gt;&gt; and say it's my inheritance. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Every say let's just &gt;&gt; let's say you are God alone &gt;&gt; from before time began. &gt;&gt; You are on your throne.
