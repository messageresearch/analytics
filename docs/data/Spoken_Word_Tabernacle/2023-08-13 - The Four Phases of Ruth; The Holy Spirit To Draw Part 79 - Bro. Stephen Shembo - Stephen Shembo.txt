very much you might be seated all from Canada came to visit and came to her for for a wedding but we surely enjoyed the presence of everybody this morning if there is someone here that I have forgotten that is a family member not a visitor God richly bless you amen I believe that everybody is up to date with the sermon I believe you all reading your Bible two chapters a day according to brother Branham one chapter in the morning one chapter a night and the scriptures say meditate day and night so we all doing that right we all doing reading our Cod book our sales our church ages our 70 weeks of Daniel so everybody's clear praise be to the name of the Lord amen yesterday we have a wonderful session on question and answer everything went well by God's grace and those who were there I believe they kind of prepare for the sermon this morning amen Lord's willing our next question and answer will be on September the 16th remember so it's going to be a month from today September 16th those dates do not really depend on us they depend we are depending on the venue until we built that Fellowship Hall then we don't have to depend on anyone but we just have a fixed date like either the second weekend of the month or the third weekend of the month and everybody knows about it but until then we still have to depend on the venue so September 16th the Lord's willing we see you at 2 30. amen for the young sisters it'll be August the 26th and we have a follow-up for the young Sisters Meeting and the Young's men meeting is on September 2nd everybody got me Amen brother Derek Cherry he sent me a message from South Africa he asked me to greet the church so brother Derek usually these are our invisible audience the way way way far away but they're listening to almost every sermon that is coming up here so brother Derek you heard me brother Derek say greet the church and spoken word Tabernacle say what you heard them God we actually bless you amen so we have one more to go before we get back to our teaching on prayer how to pray so bear with me there is one Minister that was already scheduled and we will go from there so Lord's willing I heard the request of the young sisters for fellowship and they are the younger one for fellowships so bear with me I will talk to Sister Pam and see what we can do I don't see sister Pam probably she either traveled or something but we figure it out what to do I believe I got everything covered but Robert did I forget something brother Kelly we clear so let's go to our scripture this morning Genesis chapter 1. very familiar scripture glory to God everybody have some good sleep nice weekend okay refreshed amen glory to God Genesis chapter 1 verse 26. I will see how the leading of the spirit goes because we can drop quickly deep here and uh try to find how we can land amen Genesis chapter 1 verse 26. you there my friend okay ready and God say let us make man in our image so men look like who God you might be seated so this man that was made was made in the image and in what my friend the likeness so in the image he looks like God in the likeness he is like God so this man is God amen amen if a dog gives birth to something what is the dog giving birth to [Music] if an elephant give birth an elephant is giving birth to what if God is giving birth God is birthing who God is it complicated this message is never complicated Hallelujah and God say let us make man in our image after our likeness and let them so this man is double he's plural he's not one man because the Bible says them if you look it looks like one man but it's two people we okay then we went through this before so you should be hollering amen quickly so we can move on Amen and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the file of the earth that the air and over the cattle and over all the Earth and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the Earth so when man is created by God he is created with the power to control are we reading the same Bible I'm reading King James version that's what brother Branham used are we reading the same Bible so man when he's created he is created to have dominion in other words when man is fabricated automatically he's fabricated with the power to have dominion to dominate Man was created to dominate not dominant man we are clear man was not created to dominate man he was created to dominate nature the file of the air the Beast of the field and thing when men begin to dominate somebody something is wrong then it's a nicolating spirit [Applause] everybody okay so the one you need to dominate is not your brother it's not your system you dominate the dog you got dominated the elephant when you go to the zoo then show your muscles everybody okay so man was given Dominion by birth amen so in you in all of you you have this potential all of you here have this potential whether you believe it or you don't want to believe it you have this potential even if you refuse it's already loaded in you when they fabricate the computer whatever a computer need is there whether you turn that computer on and not the potential is there all you have to do is hook the computer to the power then the software will begin to work so your software is already prepared program ordained predestinated to dominate amen so if you are dominated by something you don't know who you are [Music] [Applause] you should be always the head amen and never to tell amen if you either tell something is wrong the problem is you you letting somebody take over everybody okay oh my God job to verse 27 glory to God so God created her man in his own water image and in the image of who God and the Bible said the image of God is Christ then God who was creating man for to be more precise look like this light here the God that was created he looks like that the God that was creating was looking like God so when he was creating he was creating something that looked also like that that's why he's the Father of Lights because God is like so he was creating a theophany that looked like him [Applause] that's why that tea off and you already have power already hooked into him everybody okay we have to stretch you that's what they say in my word that's my language amen glory to God Amen and in his own image created he him how male and female so you see that man who was not really man the way we understand it in other words this even you sister you included in this if you say in Christ there is no because at the beginning when government when Man was created like Christ he was already male and female so when you look at Adam you don't know where which how is he because he's a light that's when we get in the body that when that's when you can make a difference so man is male and female so this Dominion is not only for men that's right it's for sisters also amen amen male and female created heat them amen verse 28. and God did what bless them stop why do you bless a god I thought man when he was created he already have dominion God already told him that I created you have fabricated you for you to dominate to have dominion why does he need a blessing why why do you bless God why does Jesus need the pillar of Fire in Jordan why does Judah need another baptism of Satan oh my God you remember yesterday right amen you remember yesterday right amen even though Judah was born the Son of Perdition for him to fulfill his mission he needed a permission from Jesus Christ Jesus gave him something to eat and the Bible said the devil enter him and even Jesus himself have to go to Jordan so that the pillar of fire can enter into him so being created give you already the engine but despite the engine you need something to activate you need the dynamic to activate it your potential is already there the reason why the potential are not operating because you have now receiving the blessing the blessing yet Man was created in the image and the likeness of God men look like God God created him to have dominion but before men begin to exercise that Dominion God have to bless him amen amen this blessing doesn't change the fact that you were already God there is a blessing that followed amen what is the purpose of this blessing Amen in other words there is a potential but that potential needs a blessing and when the blessing comes it kick in what is the purpose of this blessing why do you bless a god he's already God you already say you give him the Dominion why do you need to bless him again verse 28 and God blessed them not one bless both of them and God said to them amen be what fruitful and do whatever multiply and water replenish the Earth and do what subdue it and have water Dominion is this Dominion different than the one God put there no so this blessing is only to make you aware of what you of your abilities in other words the blessing that is coming is only to bring out what you already are everybody okay when you created you created for Dominion you have potentials amen so when the blessing is coming do you know that uh Jacob got the blessing amen he got the blessing and then he ran away but he was still suffering he was still working working and they changed his salary the first time the second time until he began even to cheat he thought he was under a curse but when he met the angel of the Lord he began to fight he was still looking for blessing did you see the angel blessing him again and saying Jacob I give you blessing did you see the angel blessing him the angel just changed his name that change of name finishes everything because Jacob was already blessed amen so we are already created with this when the blessing is coming it's only making you aware or bringing out or activating whatever God already loaded you into it if they say be fruitful means that in you you have fruit how can you be fruitful if you don't have food if they say be fruitful it means that you already have fruit it's up to you to find out how to bring those fruits out are we okay we clear so far so the Bible says God bless them and God say be fruitful and multiply and replenish the Earth and subdue it and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fall of the air he's repeating the same thing he already made man for that's why brother brought them say God man was a God of this Earth so God is only reminding God that hey this is the responsibility this is what you need to do this is what I created you for amen and the and the file of the years and every living thing that move upon the Earth everybody okay everybody good so far let's go to Matthew 13. so Man was created in the image in the likeness of God but despite that creation that give him potential he needed the blessing and the blessing to put into operation whatever potential was already created in him Jesus was God he was Emmanuel he was God being born but Jesus needed the Jordan he even before he can start his ministry even Judas needed Satan to enter to him when Satan entered Jesus say whatever you have to say to do go ahead and do it quickly because now you are anointed with the fullness of the devil badly brother Branham say Jesus Christ was God incarnated and Judah was Satan incarnated we okay now okay Matthew 13 verse 14. verse 15 Matthew 13 verse 15 if you dare you can say amen amen we went through this I'm going to draw something there for this people's heart is wax gross and their ears are dull of hearing and the eyes they have clothes less at any time they should do what see there is only three things that I want to draw there number one it's about the eyes you remember this to see and their ears you remember this right to here and the third one is what the heart what do you do with the heart can you read it understand you know do you see where you understand not here you understand here when you understand the message here it doesn't help you because the message Target is nothing is never here I shall send you Malachi for to turn the hearts when the message hit here then you understand the message by that understanding is not here it's called revelation amen let's say anytime they should see with their eyes and hear with their ears and should understand with the heart and should be have converted and I should do what to heal them so to be converted you must heal you must see and you must also understand with the heart all three need to be connected are we okay amen now let's go back to uh let's go down to verse 16. but blessed as your what eyes for the sea and your water ear for the water here did you see him talking about the heart that's why the disciple didn't receive the Holy Ghost until the day of Pentecost because if they already understood with their heart they should be converted that's why Jesus told Peter when you are converted go strengthen your brother because Peter was not converted yet he was converted when you received the Holy Ghost that's what brother Branham say we already went through this everybody okay we got those three elements remember let's go to John then we pray glory to God John chapter 4 it's a little bit lengthy let's pray because this is lengthy Heavenly Father Lord we are approaching you humbly this this morning Father once again thanking you for your grace your love and your mercy and for everything you have been doing for us father we are committing this service unto their hand may you move me completely out of the way may you come and speak to your children father and bless us may we depart from this church differently than the way we came in May you seal the devil and his army away from this place because your Prophet told us that Holy Angel also in Camp and they stay in the churches we believe that they were already here but we need your presence more than anything in the name of Jesus Christ amen John chapter 4 verse 7 if you dare you can say Amen there Kim comes a woman of Samaria to draw water the purpose she was coming was to draw water yes yes you keep that Jesus said to her give me to drink amen amen for his disciple were gone away to the city to buy meat then saved the woman of Samaria to him how is it that you being what a Jew what was the woman looking at flesh the Flesh of Jesus Christ are we together are we together so the contact of the flesh got the woman confused because Jesus decided to take the body of a Jew everybody okay so the first Contact of this woman the body contact of this woman she qualified or called Jesus Christ a Jew was really Jesus a Jew no amen Jesus was not a Jew let me help you up a lot of you [Laughter] that's that's why this message is different amen amen you are what you are but the blood of your father everybody okay if your father is from the Congo amen it doesn't matter how your complexion is you receive Congolese bread if your father is an American you receive American blood amen so the blood of Jesus Christ came from which father which Jewish father contributed to the blood of Jesus Christ it's an Immaculate birth brother Branham saying brother Branham said the egg and the sperm both of them were created by God amen so Jesus even though he chose to go through Mary have nothing to do with the Jews that's why the blood of Jesus Christ can save everybody amen it is not a Jewish blood it is the very blood of God Amen that's why the blood of Christa is a precious blood amen because it's a blood of God God in human flesh he looked like a Jew but he was not a Jew so the first bull is very dangerous amen everybody okay everybody good glory to God verse 9 then say the woman of Samaria to him how is it that you being a Jew ask me of drink which I am a woman of water Samaria so he got into prejudice you racism you're a Jew or magenta didn't know that that was not really a Jew that was the very God himself amen so the body contact can get you in trouble they Veil that a prophet used can get you in trouble if you arrest this you won't receive brother Branham [Applause] if you were racist you always say brother Brandon that's right but the color of brother Branham is not a problem to me because I know who was inside today amen [Applause] amen I don't identify God by the color of the skin but identify God by his characteristics amen when he can turn the back like this it is not a man it is not an American all right it is the Fulfillment of Genesis 18. amen [Applause] you will miss God by me because of the skin [Applause] he chose by his sovereignty to use an American that's it that is his choice all I say is amen amen that's the choice of God that is not your choice you are not there to advise him he's so fit to use an American amen for the Jew has not dealing with the water Samaritans Jesus answered and said to her if you knew the gift of God and who in other words you don't know who you talking to because you caught up into the flesh amen the flesh is troubling you amen if you knew the gift of God and who is it that says to you give me a water to drink you should have asked of him and he would have given you water Living Water so there is two well there is a world that existed there that Jesus asked for water and Jesus is moving the woman from a well a natural well to another well but the natural way for you to get water you need to have something to draw amen because the world is usually deep let me read it [Applause] amen amen let's go to verse 11. the woman said to him my brother what did he say what did she say Sir that has nothing to draw with and and the well is deep from whence then hast thou that Living Water the woman is saying that I see you you are talking about giving me water to begin with to have water you must have a tool to draw water the reason why you needed to because the wear is not superficial the well is deep correct amen amen so when the well is deep you must have something to draw with amen everybody okay when the whale is deeper when the well is deep whether it's a natural amen amen or it is a spiritual well amen we need the tool to draw [Applause] that is what we're dealing with today amen you need something to draw amen the woman had the war was needed to Joe welder from menacho well that's why Jesus asked him he said would you help me have water because she had the tomb and she looked at Jesus and Jesus said you know what yeah if you knew who I am you would have asked me to give you water so the woman thought that Jesus is talking about the same way and the woman say but you want to give me worthy I don't even see you with a bucket how are you going to draw water and give it to me amen if a natural well need a natural bucket or a natural bucket to draw the spiritual aware also need the bucket [Applause] remember the water is in the Deep everybody good Have I Lost anybody amen well if you can you can help me click this right here by the Angelo if you can please my brother thank you amen thank you very much amen the Bible says verse 11 the woman thank you my brother the woman says to him sir you have nothing to draw the world is how the remember that from where then have you that living water water are you greater than our father Jacob which gave us the well I can get to this because it's another sermon and drunk thereof himself and his children and his cattle Jesus answered and said to her whosoever drink of water this water shall do water and thirst again because it's a natural water amen so there is a natural thirst and a spiritual test remember we already talked about tests because test is the Deep calling to the Deep amen you cannot test if you don't have water in you so whatever you taste is already new [Applause] [Music] whatever you are testing is already on you it's a deep that is calling to a deeper glory to God verse 14 but whosoever drink of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst so you see the different tests but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a what oh well of water so when that what they're getting you it becomes a well so actually they are putting a well in you that was there doesn't come itself when I put this water in you and then the word that comes with the bottle everybody okay and that shall give him aware of water springing up into water Everlasting so everlasting life begin to come from that well that's why you can impart life [Music] [Applause] if you have the Holy Ghost you can lay hand on somebody else and they can get the Holy Ghost you are dispatched [Applause] it's like a franchise [Applause] oh my God Lord help me verse 15 the woman said to him sir give me water this one now the woman is moving now to a different world like now I understand give me the water give me this water that attest nah need they come here to water so draw so she already disqualified that water now she's caught up to a different water I don't want this anymore because this keeps bringing me here give me that word that I drink I won't have to come again everybody okay glory to God verse 16. Jesus said to her call go call who thy husband and come where hither Jesus is already changing gears to the second Pole because Jesus already discerned the woman and saw what was wrong in her life so the gear I already changed to the second pool we okay okay no problem I hope I don't want to lose anyone verse 17 the woman answered and said I have water no husband Jesus said to her you have water thou Hast well said you have well said I have no husband for you have how five husbands that's the second pool discerning five husband and he whom you have now uh whom you now have is not your husband in that say you truly watch again at the beginning the woman said that being a now watch what the second pool is doing to the woman amen amen amen the second pool is moving her up watch what the second pool does verse 19 the woman said to him sir I perceive that there are water a prophet is not enough ah oh my God it's not a mafia [Applause] not the second the second the spirit of the woman when he was contacted amen he unfolded the woman he brought the woman to a prophetic level he said now thou art a prophet no longer a Jew because the characteristic you are displaying is not a normal Jew it's a characteristic of a prophet amen and that was fulfilled by the second Paul if you notice if you look look at verse 9 the Bible say then says the woman of Samaria to him how is it that that being what a Jew it's verse nine because the numerology of the Bible don't pray it's verse 9 is a Jew amen God to 19. [Applause] so let me put 29 down here so every time we go 10 something open I keep 20 now but we are not in 29 yet everybody okay we okay we okay that is still knowing that he's a Jew didn't help her amen knowing that he's a prophet still doesn't help the woman but he already prepared the woman everybody okay you need to go beyond the prophet yes yes sir an American is not enough a prophet is good but it's not enough you need to see beyond the prophet what you see beyond the prophet that's what gives you life everybody okay glory to God how many people believe that brother Branham was a prophet they say brother Brown and we believe Prophet we understand by the prophet but what you preaching we don't want to take it right now only a rainbow and fly that level in other words Jesus is pulling until she get to where he wants everybody okay verse 20 Lord help me for our father our fathers worshiping this mountain you say that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship Jesus said to a woman believe me they are our cometh when you shall neither in this mountain nor Atwater Jerusalem worship the father you worship you know not what we know what we worship for salvation is of the water Jews let me skip quickly amen job to verse 24 God is a water a spirit and they that worship he must worship him where in spirit and what in truth you already know this watch verse 25 the woman said to him I know that water Messiah coming now the conversation is no longer a prophet because when they ask John the Baptist the question they say are you one of the prophets or are you him that he means the Messiah the Messiah is not a prophet he is the prophet he is the god of the prophet so the conversation now is changing the woman is now climbing into a different level like wait a minute amen this is no more discernment but the preaching the opening of the world that is coming up is pulling the woman into a level like this kind of talking only the Messiah should do something like that [Applause] Jesus say okay the target is zero go ahead and shoot when you shoot there to kill it's a it's a third when you pull that the fish have to come out everybody okay verse 25 the woman say I know that Messiah cometh which is called how Christ look how the woman Cramer if you notice the woman is talking vaguely in other words she understand that there is a messiah that need to come but that's not good enough she need to take the Messiah and put it on Jesus knowing that the Messiah cometh is fine you must identify who is the Messiah [Applause] [Music] [Applause] just as you identify him as a Jew you identify him as a prophet your own mouth have to identify him as the Messiah [Applause] everybody good everybody good okay praise God ah man we are 25 when he comes he will tell us what all things stop the Messiah doesn't give you things in portion that's right when the Messiah come he will cover everything when you see a Ministry that cover everything that can tell you everything [Music] [Applause] a Ministry that opened the entire world the entire Bible from Genesis to Revelation is open that's a messiah oh yeah it is a masalic Ministry I'm not talking about this man I'm talking about the one on top of the man [Applause] the reason why this man have to be used because the body of Jesus is locked if the body of Jesus move it triggered the rapture normally Jesus himself was supposed to do that because he did it to the Jews and the Samaritan but because of the Rapture they have to borrow somebody that's why brother Branham said he borrowed brother brother means not the body of Jesus Christ it's a borrowed body to reveal a son of man revealing [Applause] I'm trying to go back to what I'm trying to prepare today amen so a minute when the Messiah cometh he will show you the full world is connected to the Messiah because faith has been lost but a promise say that Elijah succumb and restore how can Elijah restore all things but but all things belong to the ministry of the Messiah so that's a larger Ministry [Applause] [Music] [Applause] that's why brother Branham said the Elijah of this day is the Lord Jesus Christ but he has to come through a prophet he said it's a channel [Applause] is he complicated is it complicated oh God help me up where am I at verse 26 Jesus said to her I that speak to you I am he now Jesus tell her Jesus himself revealed to her no nobody told him if you ask her how do you know Jesus is Christ he won't tell you P they told me he will not tell you brother Stephen said me myself me myself he told me he revealed to me myself that he is the messiah and he is the word of God and when the word open up and revealed to you nobody need to tell you anything else [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] I'm preaching something different my friend let me ask you a question did you see Jesus praying for that woman did you see Jesus casting out the devil he cast therefore he marry Magdalene but not this one so when the World opened up to you he remove all the Devils amen amen [Applause] that's what that's why brother Branham said there is no higher form of God to reveal them his word when the World opened up you don't need to be prayful [Applause] the woman never say okay now that I know you the Messiah go ahead and pray for me and remove this prostitution Spirit no if I know you the Messiah the prostitution spirit is already gone [Music] this is the difference between us and the Pentecost amen it is the opening of the world [Applause] when did she when she saw it do you know what she did nobody told her job in either one by seeing that the party's already done [Applause] now she begins to testify so when the Revelation come it puts you in testimony amen [Applause] it's a personal revelation of Jesus Christ to you [Applause] nobody between that because the Bible say he said the disciple away he took the disciple he said ah get away I don't want after my departure this woman begin to follow after you [Applause] that's right everybody okay everybody okay job to verse 29 my God [Music] 29. remember 9 19 and what let's see 29.99 she says he was a water in 19 he should say he was what a prophet now we need to hear from her own mouth in 29. the numerology of the Bible you don't get this only by Malachi 4. [Applause] that's why you need the prophet [Music] you there amen look at the woman come and water see a man amen amen amen comma which told me water all things that I ever did is not Disturbed Christ now the woman called Jesus Christ there it is from a Jew to a water a profit from a prophet to water right when you meet him as Christ your trouble is over [Music] [Applause] everybody okay everybody good everybody are good because Jesus said God is a spirit they that worship we must worship Him how in spirit and in water truth so to draw the spiritual water you need something that can go deeper yeah everybody okay everybody good my subject this morning is the four phases of roof the Holy Spirit to draw everybody good everybody good already praise God we are still dealing with the last phase of roof amen roof rewarded and we found out that when the spirit of the Lord come in your life amen when that Spirit come in your life and enter into your life amen it is just a starting point you remember that I gave you quotes from Brother Branham and everything and once that started break started what happened is the Holy Ghost get into you and releases the love of God we sin that I gave you quote and everything amen and first of all before even that he will circumcise you because we have uh you need the circumcision of the heart we went through that and he removed the Surplus the excess of the flesh remove a Stony heart amen releases the love of God and when the love of God is released into you it brings the bond of perfectness you remember that you and God you are married and it's finished and brother Branham say when that love come if you remember last Sunday that love will cast out fear you remember that because the Bible said perfect love casts out water and brother Branham said when the fear is removed amen then love will produce faith because the great commandment need to be fulfilled in your life only the Holy Spirit can fulfill it the holy spirit will make you walk keep and do the will of God you remember last Sunday amen and the last thing the holy spirit will come is remove fear completely from you and when fear is removed brother Branham say the holy spirit will be places fear by faith or by revelation Faith by definition in Hebrew 11 verse 1 the Bible says that Faith you know this now is the substance everybody okay go to Hebrew 11 my friend so we can climb up now the Bible say in Hebrew 11 verse 1 now Faith is what the substance faith is a substance a substance we all quoted this for years amen faith is the substance of water things hoped for and the water the evidence of water Things Not Seen so we got two worlds that are hidden water we have an invisible world and a visible word you have a world of the Unseen or the invisible amen or the imaginary amen this is where we hope because you don't see what you're hoping for everybody okay and we have another world that is the word of the visible amen or a material all natural world amen this is where you see things like I see this chair I see this point I can touch the boy all of these are visible amen now the Bible says that faith is the substance the substance of things hopeful amen so before something become Faith he was actually in an unseen way are we together before something become faithful it usually starts as a hope it starts as an imagination it starts as something that you are thinking in your mind you want to get married one day are you married now is still in your mind it's hope amen where is your wife I don't see her where's she at do you know her you don't know all you know is something is there I'm gonna get married it's just a hope that hope doesn't help you man the fact he can torment you everybody okay he can trouble you especially young sister because they want to get married they want to get married he looks like marriage is somewhere but they don't have the man everybody okay everybody good now Faith is the substance of what you are hoping for but it's also an Evidence of what you have not seen yet in other words in between the invisible and the visible word faith is laying ready in other words faith is the state in between the invisible and the visible world Have I Lost somebody in other words when you hoping for something before that which you hope become material you have to go through the channel of faith everybody okay in other word when something leave hope or leave the invisible and become a substance he exists everybody okay if something reached the level of Faith you are 100 guaranteed that's nothing existence everybody okay as long as it's not faithful it's a speculation he might or might not happen but once he reached the level of Faith a substance it will happen the problem is you don't see it yet so this substance help you understand that you already gathered even though you don't see it yet that's why it's a substance of things hoped for the evidence of what you have not seen yet so faith is what quieting your nerve [Applause] [Music] everybody okay everybody good everybody okay so far so faith is the substance the substance of what what you are hoping for when he moved from hope it is no longer here it is standing right there when he stand here safe tells you that you got it but if brother Benjamin asked you where is it you don't you cannot show it to brother Benjamin but you can see it you don't see it with your eyes you see it with a different eye everybody okay everybody good so when we say substance what is a substance William Marion Branham brother Branham say it's been said and it's true that coward died ten thousand times where a hero Never Dies I'm reading brother Branham so you say Amen to the prophet God wants people who are How brave and can take the water stand if anything that Christ could not use in his kingdom will be a water coward so if you are a coward you need to deal with that spirit amen a coward is a man that always look at the negative side [Applause] [Music] [Applause] every time you bring him a project he will talk more about the failure versus the the the the success in other words he doesn't want to try anything he want to stay in the comfort zone he doesn't want to progression he's comfortable with mediocrity [Applause] if you tell him do this he doesn't want it because it's too much headache and he will show you what about this happened what about this happen what about this happen but what about if he work remember amen not to stay around somebody who's negative [Applause] it's a negative vibration you wanna do something don't do it be careful what I have a big God Amen [Applause] God doesn't want to lose coward [Applause] everybody okay glory to God brother Branham say have water faith in God the first place we should find out what faith is the Bible says that faith is water the substance of water things hoped for and it is water the evidence of water things not seen this little word faith get mixed up a lot of time with water oh Hope and Faith they are just as much water different as water days from night faith is water the substance and hope is water what you're hoping for faith is here hope is over there Faith do water delivers to make it clear When Faith something is already in faith amen it's already being packaged in Amazon amen do you hear me it's already in package it is ready for shipping it's gonna be shipped to your home and you're gonna hear a ring bear coming up telling you that he delivers it is faith that deliver death is your shipping company [Applause] [Music] it's a company that pick up your item put it in the shipping put the right address process it and send it and deliver that to you faith is the company that pick your item that pick your order your order is here your order is sent to Faith and Faith process your order and bring your order home [Music] amen William Marion Branham he says faith being the water substance of water things hopes for then it would not just be a water at all fat is an imagination it would not be a water at all but it's water a substance now a substance is something that you can have let's clarify this a little bit more William Marion Branham my scripture lesson to not say faith is the substance of water things hoped for the evidence of water Things Not Seen It is water a substance it is something Direct something that you really have amen not something that you imagine something that you think you have but it's some direct positive at that water that's why I say faith is 100 guarantee amen William Marion pranam he said faith is different than what you think it is or not what you I mean the average person would think mostly it is Hope instead of faith you have a mental conception of faithful what it means immense and mentally you have faith but you go deeper than that you go away remember the world is away faith is water that's why you don't want to stay around negative it is a water the substance not a mess not an intellectual imagination but it is water a substance and a substance is something that you can hold on to amen in other words faith is your anchor amen when you have faithful even though the wind is blowing self is what you hold on to it if you have hope the wind will take you away only fat can resist the wind [Music] everybody okay why is this Faith here important why glory to God listen to brother Branham they said that nothing is impossible to who God God said nothing is impossible with who you we wanna know who is the you who is the you that nothing is impossible this is the you if you want to believe not with God but with who you so that you is the you that believe let's go to the Book of Mark chapter 9. glory to God let's go to Mark chapter 9 because we're dealing with faith faith is a substance a substance of things hopeful in evidence of what you don't see Faith delivers faith is what you can hold on to it amen and brother Branham say we usually say nothing is impossible with God but God is saying nothing is impossible to you we need to know when is nothing impossible to you when what makes you what makes you you which a level where everything you want to work because everything God wants he will do it nothing me when they say nothing is impossible to God it means that God can do anything if God wants to create a chair he will create it if God wants to appear now he will appear there is nothing that is impossible to God but now we need to know when is nothing impossible to us Mark 9 verse 22 if you dare you can say amen amen you there amen Jesus said to him what if thou can't believe so if you can believe if you can have faith amen let's go Kama then all things are possible to him that believeth so faith is the key that makes all things possible to you in other words if you want to do something find faithful if you find Faith whatever you need there won't be anything that can block you if you find faithful faith is what makes you like God [Applause] created the world by believing his own word that's what brother Branham saying the word was framed by the word of God the things that are visible were made by invisible God use Faith to be important so that nothing can be impossible to him faith is what make you act like God [Applause] everybody okay so if you have faith nothing is impossible to you that's why the Bible say it is impossible to please God without water so when God found faith in you God begin to Rejoice he say now I don't have to do anything that man can do everything just like me I'm mine brother Branham say deity is where the very God that stood but there on a medical platform mythical platform of The Eternity and raw water worlds so the man that was saying let there be let there be let there be let there be words off of his hand and created these things give you the water privilege to be what his son we know what the Son of God means a son of a dog is a dog a son of a goat is a goat a Son of God is God we already went through this amen and you are a part of him and God dwell away in mankind and man himself is water deity in the beginning Man was created in the image and the likeness of her God Hallelujah there you are he might shock you but study over that a little while god dwelled well in a man and man become a Son of God not him himself but who the holy spirit that is where in him is water God the Creator lives where in the creation oh my how I think of that then stand with a water unwavering faith and ask what you will and he shall be water down unto you there he is God there he is amen the problem is this but the trouble of it is with science they are moving on and we preacher are doing water setting still we got iphone 5 iphone 6 iPhone 7 iPhone 8 whatever message believer there it is Glory together that's it they move up until they can do whatever explaining Adam but we named Divine Healing or something another well see what Moody said about her what doctor so-and-so said they were all right in their age we are moving on science can only climb as far and it falls back we got the unsearchable [Applause] untapped resources younger but they think of it is they have to look back and see if their school part started don't let any preacher limit yourself in this message it's the preacher don't don't believe it that's his problem you believe our faith Jesus Jesus was God okay Jesus was God and Jesus said the work that I do me God you shall do it even how greater if I can do something greater than Jesus who are you to limit what I can do foreign there is no territory in this message that you can block me to access whatever the message say belong to me if the pastor don't believe it that's his problem take the full world [Applause] Lord help me I don't care what this could say the Bible said it that is water God's science book what is God science book The Bible very close never fail don't have enough passes if God's word said so it is water the truth so we need Faith to be like God [Applause] why do we need this faith my brother brother Branham says this I read this last Sunday the great physician who is here who said this son shall follow them that believe if they lay hand on the sick they shall recover if you say to this mountain be moved and done that in your heart but you can believe if he can create water squirrels who has no way at all or nothing there to believe it is my own faith that goes and War and daughter does that so which Faith created the square is Faith for who brother Brian the faith of brother brother made him look like God [Applause] created Square because of Faith what the brother also begin to create Square but brother Branham say it's massive [Applause] because God said nothing is impossible to you not to me I can create it the problem is you I'm asking you to create you gotta use your faith [Applause] [Music] [Applause] I hope I'm I hope we are getting where we're going oh my god brother Branham says it is myself this kind of stuff it's a shame when we preach the Supernatural and the people in this message look at you like they are dreaming chandelier back and forth looking at the chandelier and the chandelier went this way and turn around and stop brother brother never touched the chandelier the woman that was there scream he said no but I'm saying I thought you told me you believe I told you to move it you say no brother Brandon begin to look and the chandelier goes tell them who is moving the chandelier brother Brenner your faith can move something amen your faith can make the devil for this [Applause] [Music] [Applause] oh my God this message came to introduce you to your godship [Applause] this message this message came to introduce you to who you really are to make you understand that you just not a human being you are God and you need to be acting like God listen this is not a religion this is not another church an initiation [Applause] let's go my friend he said it is my honor they did water goes and does that my faith in what he what challenged me to ask [Applause] [Music] God said what do you need what are you doing here I'm hunting you're hunting for what was he hunting for Bible he said you're hunting for square go ahead and speak it is up to you to believe what God Said in other words God is asking you he's only trying to activate what you already have Jesus have to crank the woman from a Jew towards Prophet from a prophet to a messiah when he she reached the level of the Messiah Jesus took his hand off and went away and then like in other words the engine is already cranking leave it alone and the woman forget about Jesus in the city so Jesus going left to the woman going right in by the way the engine is turned on I don't have to tell her anything the remaining the guarded hair will begin to do the work [Applause] oh my God he said he challenged me to do water ask him and I received his letter challenge [Music] in obedience to water his word God in heaven knows that is water true [Applause] by the problem even want to stop God how many you say go back again you don't believe it ah you said three let's go back again go ahead and get make sure it's there before you go back why is this Faith important why is the faith important Lord help me listen to brother Branham 63 brother Branham say God secret mystery he had one before the world began now back in the water back part of what God's mind not the front part of God so God has a front mind and a back mind you are so amazed like God you also have a front mind and a Batman but as a man thinking boy in his heart the back minded that's why brother pranam say there is a conscious a first consensus and a subconscious a subconscious is a conscious below the first conscience is your mind that is operated by your brain but the subconscious brother Branham said it's your soul that's why you understand with your heart everybody okay so there is a mind and a mind a mind on top and a mind under there is a front mind and a backpack mind everybody okay the front man is in your brain that's your intellect but the bad part is in your heart that's what Jesus said have faith in water whatever you believe if you say to this mountain and believe where in your heart in the back part not in the front in the back part if I lost somebody have I lost someone but the problem say God also in the back part of God's mind there was something that was true that he was trying and was going to achieve and he had the water a motor in doing it in order to let himself Be Water Express so the back part Mind Of God had a mystery in other words when God speak there was another part of God that was deep in the back part that God never say anything about it God just kept quiet he would just say you know what day Israel will be taken to Egypt and they will stay there for 40 100 years and I would deliver them with a mighty hand that is the front part of God everybody can read it and that and and understand that that Israel will go to Egypt and God will deliver them what does deliver means in the backpacked man of God when God said I will deliver them with a mighty hand the back part of man of God has Moses the front path said I would deliver them with a mighty hand that's why Moses could be put in the hand of pharaoh and Pharaoh doesn't kill him because the bad part man of God is sealed [Music] you have not called me yet you have not understood yet let me and make you understand better when God say Israel will go to Egypt after 400 years I will come and deliver them you should ask God the question how are you going to deliver them who are you going to use to deliver them and what do you mean by Mighty hand all of that is love it's in the Park part man in other words your father said go to school I will take care of that you heard go to school but I would take care of that doesn't mean what you hear it means at 10 AM daddy will swing by you in school and pay the school fee and get out daddy don't tell you that he just say you go to school everybody okay the back path man of God is what control everything everybody okay because the bad part Mind Of God was sealed do you follow me do you follow me the devil didn't know who God is going to use [Applause] everybody okay he doesn't know is it this he said you know what those Hebrew children begin to kill them and he did it in the time of Jesus Christ he didn't know who Jesus was but he can tell by the front part that the prophecy is about to happen but where is this child he doesn't know he said you know what how old is he he should be around two years two years every child from two years down weapon per Adventure I can catch that one so he thought he's gonna wipe the children and they start taking the children to the crocodile the back part of man have something different because the back part of Mind was locked God took Moses and sent him to Old pharaoh and Gabrielle came Gabriel came he said father what are you doing what he said Gabriel give me a Coca-Cola I'm just paraphrasing God opened his Coca-Cola and say let let Moses go he said but they're going to kill him he say the plan is here [Applause] everybody okay everybody okay Mercy who who directed The Sheep of Moses towards pharaoh it's a GPS that is greater than what we have God put the GPS and loaded and it's going well towards Pharaoh Pharaoh took and nourished his own enemy [Applause] a fellow knew that the man who's gonna destroy Egypt is that baby that is crying right there he would have killed it but he can't kill it because the back part of what is him [Applause] that's why when you were in this world when you were drinking and smoking they therefore didn't know who you are [Applause] he's gonna have you for eternity God was laughing but one day you heard the ego cry you heard the message of the hour the message of the hour revealed to you who you are [Music] the devil don't know what to do it is too late [Applause] now do you know who you are you became a machine of Destruction you become the one that is causing trouble to the devil you become a hot potato [Applause] [Music] [Applause] some of us our mother were not message believers Our Father were not message believers they were drunker they were catholic but despite that time God was watching you God was overshadowing you [Applause] they can shoot anybody but not you you always come out from a car accident and you don't die because God had a purpose [Music] that's why the seven seal is the greatest seal of the Bible it is the Seal of your life your life was hidden in Christ thank you [Applause] everybody good everybody good have I lost anyone have I lost anyone God has your mystery of your life hidden in him amen that's why they want to remove your pregnancy the doctor look and he say Madam madam chambo I see that the pregnancy is difficult we need to seal your womb but I'm trying to save that baby and that baby is preaching to you today [Applause] chapter he was God who was watching me [Applause] hello okay everybody okay everybody good oh my God the Lord help me so your life is a mystery and your mystery is still it is still in the back part of God [Music] it is sealed deep in a well it's in the world but it's not on the surface it is deep we need to drown we need something to draw our mystery up [Applause] are we good are we okay my friend translating to John means that one okay the mystery of water his will and remember how we hang on that how many was here this morning let's see how we stuck on that we stuck on what the mystery of his will now it is not just a little thing then it's water a mystery God's will is water a mystery the will of God the will of God the will of God is a mystery in other words what God wants you to do is a mystery because the devil cannot touch it if we touch that brother Brahman said if he would have Hitler here what the 17th say he would have caused me great damage God only give a little bit and the devil think he got everything but he doesn't know that he can heed Moses and prepare him to come and destroy pharaoh he said God's will is water a mystery and each man has to do what seek out the will of God for water yes or herself God's Water mystery so you need to know what does God want you to do but that mystery is in the Deep we need to search for a tool that can pull that information for us because when Moses understood that information it was a different Moses he was not the Moses that ran away from Egypt Egypt he was the Moses that was going towards Egypt not with a sword with a stick not the strong Moses but with God on the inside [Applause] and Moses that doesn't use muscles but every Moses that use the word he just came he said Pharaoh let my people like it his people he become God oh my God [Music] God Moses I'm making you God and he because you're a God I'm gonna give you a prophet your brother Aaron that's your Prophet so when Moses said he doesn't say God said he said my people go he become the representative of God there's spokesman of God when you see Moses it is God speaking to Israel everybody okay how do we get to this let's go to Roman 8. I'm good in time it's just where we are it makes you feel like we are far away I'm still good in time so relax your body let's go Romans chapter eight if I can lay this down then I'm gonna climb quickly Romans chapter 8. if you dare you can say Amen Romans chapter 8 verse 27 we're talking about to you and faith 27 are you there amen listen to this and he that do what searches the heart knows what is the mind of the water the spirit we okay because he the spirit maketh makes intercession for the water the Saints according to the water will of God so who knows the will of God and because he knows the will of God he knows what to pray God for you the spirit knows how to pray for you that's why he said Peter I pray for you amen and his prayer work because Peter was not lost he didn't pray for Judah even though Judah was a disciple he only selected to pray for Peter he said be the second one to sift you but I won't let him do that because you were predestinated Judah he can take Judah Judah don't belong to me remember yesterday okay verse 28 and we know that what all things work water together for good to them that do what love God and to them that are called according to water his purpose so there is a purpose of God for you and everything that goes in your life is working according to the purpose of God for your life [Applause] everything that goes in your life God won't put something in your life that won't work according to what he's trying to achieve in your life whatever God wants to achieve in your life he already programmed in other words your trial has been evaluated that's what the Bible said he will never give you a trial greater than Who You Are if a trial is greater than you God say ah not him how is he going to fail this is too much for him give me the little one put it here not this one give me that one put it here give me this one put it here something is missing give me that one Gabriel give me that one give me that one shut up you're the one crying my my mama God is just saying he say if you know what I made you if you know what I made you you will be dancing in your trial because your trial won't take you down [Applause] yeah yeah yeah

reserving God because God knew you not going nowhere that Traya feel stronger [Applause] it will make your marriage stronger [Applause] about this allow me to move my friend you're pulling left and right where am I at 28 amen oh my god let's go to when I say oh my God I'm saying that a Christian way ah so don't put it either way anyway ah Amen Let me jump to verse 29 for whom he did what foreign to the water image of his son you are programmed to become Jesus amen that he might be water the firstborn among water many Brethren now moreover whom he also did what predestining he also did water so in other words when the predestined epidemicinated when God lord predestination predestination is a combo he got salad he got tomato it's a combo predestinated he has called call have justification justification have what everything is loaded so when they take the package of predestination they loaded everything is in me if you can bite the mystery of predestination you are eating tomato you are eating you are eating the calling the justification you never donate to begin with it was the devil that did it you are also glorified [Applause] let's go if I study moreover whom he did what predestined he also did what to call and whom he called he also did what so you cannot call with that justification it's a combo and justify and whom he has water justify then he also water glorified so when you get predestination you got all of this in the package [Music] what shall we then say to this thing if water God before us who can be whatever against them how many believe that God is for you what do you have to worry in your life watch the next verse you ready verse 32. he that spell not his own son but did water delivered him up for who us all how shall he not with him also what freely gave us all things he give you how freely freely how all fake hell really let me write it here freely amen he give us free what some things all things amen we need to draw amen let's go to Second First Corinthians if I get this scripture then we move on let's go to First Corinthians Lord help me First Corinthians chapter one if you dare you can say Amen remember he give you all fixed how so I need to know how to get my offense how to withdraw I need to know how to withdraw my office now I know that all things is faithful in other words I don't have to pay anything I understand it now all things is for me if you believe there's nothing impossible to you how do I draw all things you there let's go to First Corinthians chapter one if you dare you can say amen amen let's go to verse 21. for after that in the wisdom of water God the World by the wisdom by wisdom knew not who God so there is two wisdom there is a wisdom of God and a wisdom of this world keep that in mind amen amen he pleased God by the foolishness everybody okay by the foolishness of preaching to do what save them to save them that do whatever believe everybody clear so far we clear so far job 2 verse 30. you there amen but of him are you aware in Christ Jesus who is of God who of God is made to us whatever wisdom so wisdom is who God is Christ the wisdom of God is Christ we clear we're clear now we clear that let's go to chapter two there we go we need to know how to draw you there let's follow this because sometimes message believer preacher preach this is a different route because they don't want to teach verse one and I Brethren when I came to you came not with Excellency of speech all of water wisdom which wisdom is Paul talking about of the world so we need to know when Paul is telling something don't just say oh the gospel is natural it's in power and demonstration hold on because your life is in a mystery remember your life is hidden a mystery watch Paul the wisdom declaring to you the testimony of who God for I determined not to know anything among you say who Jesus Christ and him have crucified watch verse four jump to verse four my friend you there and my speech and my preaching was not with interesting words of man's water wisdom not the wisdom of God the wisdom of man so Paul didn't preach the gospel with the wisdom of man of man but there is another wisdom which is the wisdom of God when Paul is preaching the gospel here he doesn't use the wisdom of God he's using the preaching but watch how what is he doing not the wisdom of man sorry amen not the wisdom of man amen but in the water in demonstration of the spirit and of water power that's your faith should not stand in the water wisdom of man not a wisdom of God but in the water power of God okay so when Akama preached to you I don't use the wisdom of man I use what what preaching of God and and the demonstration so your faith can be founded where in the demonstration and the power of God it looks like Paul is eliminating wisdom watch now the next verse verse 6 however you see that we speak water wisdom however I use a wisdom but not the wisdom of man so Paul was preaching with wisdom but the wisdom of God we okay now however we speak wisdom among them that are water perfect stop so the wisdom of God they don't give that to babies are we together Paul when he goes to evangelize amen he's using the power and the demonstration of the word Jesus Christ love you Jesus Christ saved you Jesus come to die for you you need the healing in your body that is the preaching of the Gospel that is Paul is trying to catch somebody and try to bring him to Christ that one Paul won't use the wisdom he keep it everybody good but when Paul catches you and baptize you and you woke up from the baptism and they lay hand on you and you receive the Holy Spirit you don't need salvation anymore now Paul say now come I need to switch the diet you don't need milk anymore [Applause] amen you are called for a purpose you need to know why God bought you here now the wisdom is coming we okay now we okay now and that wisdom they don't give it to baby they give them to those that are mature what is in that wisdom verse 6 amen however we speak wisdom among them that are hard perfect yet not the wisdom of this world nor of water the princes of this world that come to water not but we speak what the wisdom of God in the water a mystery everybody okay even the water hidden wisdom which God ordained before the world to our Glory so that wisdom is For Your Glory amen we need to know the program of life we need to know how to draw how do you draw now I know that God has something for me for my glory how do I get it Paul said when I send it to you I send it to you in in a mystery now how do you understand the mystery can I continue amen verse 8 which none of the princes of this world know had they know it there will not have water crucified the Lord of Glory are we okay now it's the people that crucify Jesus ever understood that mystery ever understood the backpacked mind of God they thought Jesus was troubling them they didn't know the backpack man of God the back part of God was Jesus would save you in order for Jesus to save you they must kill him the one Killing Jesus that's a heaven idea of you the devil knew that Killing Jesus Christ will produce so many believers and open the seventh seal the devil would have left it alone like leave Jesus alone Jesus said it is good for me God in other word if the devil heard that he should have Keep Jesus down because if Jesus don't go the Holy Ghost don't come but the devil had down by his even though he's hearing the word he's still doing what they would say [Applause] by Killing Jesus Christ he opened the door to the Holy Ghost now the Holy Ghost have to come God can enter into you if God if you don't want these people to become God lock Jesus alive keep him in love even if Jesus come and say kill me you should leave him alone the devil was searching to kill Jesus Christ Killing Jesus Christ it's an advantage to us that's what the scripture say if they knew that's what they're trying to do will produce this they would have left it alone we Okay we okay bear with me I'm gonna go to the airport because this is deep amen let's go to verse 9. but water as it is written I have not seen stop look at my board please as it is waiting water I continue the next one ears have not heard can you see my body what is the sex element so what is missing the heart watch the next verse neither have have answered into the heart of man stop how many element Paul is using are we okay Paul is using water three ears and water hearts and we know that as ear and the heart give the Holy Ghost to somebody watch what Paul is saying now let's go back to verse now but as it is written eyes has nothing if you see it's a good thing no ears have heard neither have entered this is what the disciple missed first Into the Heart of water man the water thing which God has what prepare for water them that love him so there are things that God prepare for you we need to know how to draw there are things that God has prepared for you that love him foreign what God in other words the plan of God for your life you have not caught it yet because the plan of God for your life brother Branham said it's a mystery [Applause] but it's For Your Glory how do I get access to that you don't have something to draw how do you get to the world are we okay are we good bear with me put your seat belt I'm gonna launch up and then go to the airport let's go we need to know how to get it let's go to verse 10 now with full force my friend but how God has water revealed them to us by water his Spirit stop so how do you get what God have prepared for you the spirit is doing what revealing means water make known means what faith so the spirit is the one that revealed to you the things that God has for you the one who give you faith is the holy spirit that faith is a revelation of what God wants for you [Applause] so Have I Lost You Have I Lost You In other words when the Holy Ghost entered remember he removed fear and he produce water the faith he's bringing is easy he's telling you that this is what this is what God have for you but for you together you need Faith get Faith and go get it let's read let's read it let's go verse 10. but God has what revealed them to them back to us by what his spirit for their Spirit such as water all things God has freely give us water all things God has freely give us what all things let's visit such as water so the spirit goes into the shopping mall of God right and he said who is it brother Benjamin who is it Brother David he take your list he goes into the shopping mall you say what is the do you have you been in Sam's Club and you've seen the shopping I mean the employee of Sam's Club going on there picking up stuff have you seen that before do you know what happened people are at home they don't want to go to same shopping they go online and they send the order they say I want this I want this I want this I want this and the shopping so in the store they received the order and an employee in the store begin to go around and scan the order and look at the list and say he need milk he need this because it's already paid for [Music] when did he finish he bring it to the front and they're waiting for you to come and pick it up [Applause] so the Holy Ghost have your shopping list [Applause] because your list might be different than hellish there are certain things God didn't assign you for your life [Applause] [Music] [Applause] that's why the car I like you don't like you like a different car I like a different car according to your shopping list [Applause] so are you tired so the Holy Ghost gets your list and goes into the shopping he said what does God has for his life God said he's going to be uh a boss what else you take bus in the cart the Holy Ghost is shopping what else it's over there in the corner because the spirit searches all things he's searching our things according to God's program for you [Applause] a spirit to draw [Music] a spirit to go and shop for you shopping according to God's program for you even your husband there it's the holy ghost that knows where he is [Applause] and you're looking for the Holy Ghost knows him he will make him move from another state he will make him move from another country you see people living one country and go to another country while there are women around because you're not in the shopping list if that woman is in Africa you will see that man he will try this he does away try this he doesn't later on he goes to Africa because that's why it is [Applause] if that woman is in this church that man can go left and right one day you will see him like sister look good she was here all the time [Applause] the Holy Ghost knows who he is that's why everything that happened in your life it's working for good all right if somebody is blessed praise God be happy for them you have your own list you have your own time we judge with them be happy for them the next one might be you [Music] [Applause] please let me see and wind up I'm five minutes of it let me see God verse 10 has revealed them to us by what his spirit for the spirit to do water searches all things yeah the Water Deep things of God not The Superficial thing Remember The Superficial the devil can know it but the Deep things of God there is only one person who can go there and pick it up there is only one person that can draw that that's why Jesus spoke to the woman everywhere when the Holy ghosts will come God is a spirit when the Holy Ghost will come those that worship Him must worship him in the spirit because it's the spirit that can go inside of God and when the spirit enter God he doesn't stop at the first man of God he goes deeper and then he say what do you have for this boy and the spirit search if he say I see God purpose for your life is there and the Holy Ghost come back and he come back and he's delivered when he's delivering you he come up like a fifth you begin to feel something in your heart begin to yearn for something it looks like there is a pool that always want to be something I have quote my friend well I'm just saying but I have quote the Bible says yeah the Water Deep things of God it's the spirit that can draw from the deep because the woman said the well is deep how can you draw we need something that can go in the deep and pull the Deep things that God have for us I'm gonna finish for what man knows the water things of man save the water spirit of man which is where in him in other words if God has certain things Who would know the things of God only the spirit of God amen even the face of God knows what no man everybody okay no man but the water spirit of God we clear we clear there amen job to verse 16. for who has known demand of who the Lord that he may water instruct him but we have the mind of water Christ how did you get the mind of Christ what are you trying to say and I have to stop somewhere here everybody okay so we understand that God have a plan everybody okay that plan that God has for your life it's in a mystery the only one that can go there and pick up the mystery and bring it to you is the Holy Ghost everybody okay because he can go to the Deep things of God and bring the things that God freely give it to you because everything that you receive now is a free gift you will see people try to receive what you want and they can't but it looks like yours when you try it works and if you look you say I didn't do even much effort and the people ask you how did you do to get this job you say I don't know sometimes you go to the interview they don't ask you too many questions you see just somebody look at you say how are you doing you look like a good young man what are you doing in life then tomorrow I said you know what start work tomorrow but somebody come they checking this they're checking this they're checking and after all the credential they brought I'm gonna get this job they give the gift tomorrow they say who will give you a call back they don't receive the job why yours goes quickly it's a free gift he was already paid for and it's predestinated for you let me wonder my friend and then we go remember the former things of old for I am who God and there is water no one else I am who God and there is water none like me how is this God that says that there is nobody like him we want to know how he is that he can be so special because he say I am God and like me nobody in other words I'm special in other words I am unique what makes you unique please put your seatbelt because I'm gonna head straight to the airport okay what is this God that he says that me for you I'm special you see me in your life there is nobody that can be compared to me you can search all all eternity there is none like me for your life why who what makes you special God we need to ask him a question what makes you special that you God are saying today that there is no one like you I want to know what makes you special for me why should I consider you special you want to know let's investigate then we go home declaring water the air from the water beginning and from water ancient time the things that are not yet done saying water my counsel shall stand and I will do all my water pleasure push the brake this God say that he's special he's special there is nobody like you what makes him special is that he declare the end from the beginning what does it mean in other words God when he starts something it means it's already finished [Applause] [Music] God never starts something he have not finished when God begins something he always begins something when he's finished I don't know if you're getting me in other words before God starts you God make sure he finish you he sees your end [Music] I don't know if you get me so when God begin you amen it means you already finished his specialty is you are already finished he has things about you that he already spoke about you before you even start everybody okay and the Bible say his cancer will stand [Applause] [Music] in other words what God planned for you will happen no matter what [Applause] and if and if God has not started yet it means he is now he's still working the day he will finish that's when he started so the starting of God in your life it means that he's not stabbing God is actually storing what he already finished somebody's full he's not getting it somebody's full he has not finishing when the architecture Joe something to build amen the architect one built if he didn't finish the job [Applause] he finishes the drawing he get the cost and everything and they gave him a permit when they give I architect the permit it means that your plan is approved and your plan is already finished what follow is only an implementation of Japan they won't change anything anymore [Music] amen Lord help me let me say this amen let me say this do you know how you were conceived do you know how you were born do you know that before you are who you are do you know that you went through a fight [Applause] do you know that you went through a fight do you know how many people fought against you not one person a million [Applause] yes sir brother Brandon preached a message one amen brother Branham said when the sperm comes from a male it is a Millions film that million was you so when you are from your birth you were fighting [Applause] sometimes you are even behind but for some reason you keep jumping jumping jumping jumping until you find the egg and you're not dead and all the brothers and the sisters that were fighting with you they all die so by best you are a winner if you exist today because you want a battle by birth you are a winner if you didn't win you won't exist so I'm talking to women these are winners you already a witness you won why did you want because your brother was already finished [Music] [Applause] let's stop here let's stand let's stop here we will pick it up let's stop here [Applause] [Music] if I push too hard we're gonna launch in the Deep again if I push too hard if you are a human being today is because you want a battle [Music] so what makes that you want and everybody else didn't want who gave you the strength to bypass everybody [Music] do you see how much power you have that's why you heard David say even if an army Compass me around I will be therefore confident in other words the multitude is not my problem because before I come to this world I beat the multitude [Applause] I beat all of them that's why I'm here so I'm already a winner so I'm entering this word as a winner as a champion how did you win the battle you didn't have muscle you didn't have the intelligence how did you win that battle who helped you bypass everybody who was directing because somebody can't sell about you was already finished somebody already purposed something for your heart and what he said will happen there is more deeper stuff following this but let me hold off for next time we will pick up from here you are special you're not just anybody it doesn't matter how you were born I can prove to you I have quote I mean and and and what scripture to prove it to you amen the pro the way you came in is not a problem even if you came from a prostitute why didn't you drop you do you know how many pregnancy did we move why they didn't remove yours sometimes your mother suffer a lot but finally you came out God has a mystery for your life God has a plan for your life and those plan are good plan that's what I was trying to get to with those plans are good plan the only one who knows that plan who can get deep and pull it up it's the spirit of the Lord a spirit to draw that's why the Holy Ghost is you you can I cannot offer emphasize the
