[48:52] request of the young sisters for
[48:54] fellowship and they are the younger one
[48:56] for fellowships so bear with me I will
[49:00] talk to Sister Pam and see what we can
[49:02] do I don't see sister Pam probably she
[49:04] either traveled or something but we
[49:06] figure it out what to do I believe I got
[49:08] everything covered but Robert did I
[49:10] forget something brother Kelly
[49:11] we clear so let's go to our scripture
[49:14] this morning
[49:17] Genesis chapter 1.
[49:21] very familiar scripture
[49:26] glory to God everybody have some good
[49:29] sleep
[49:31] nice weekend
[49:34] okay refreshed
[49:36] amen glory to God Genesis chapter 1
[49:42] verse 26.
[49:45] I will see how the leading of the spirit
[49:47] goes because we can drop quickly deep
[49:51] here
[49:52] and uh
[49:54] try to find how we can land amen
[49:58] Genesis chapter 1 verse 26.
[50:01] you there my friend
[50:03] okay ready
[50:05] and God say
[50:07] let us make man
[50:10] in our image so men look like who God
[50:15] you might be seated
[50:18] so this man
[50:21] that was made was made in the image
[50:25] and in what my friend the likeness
[50:28] so in the image he looks like God
[50:31] in the likeness he is like God
[50:35] so this man is God
[50:38] amen amen
[50:45] if a dog gives birth to something
[50:49] what is the dog giving birth to
[50:52] [Music]
[50:53] if an elephant give birth an elephant is
[50:56] giving birth to what
[50:57] if God is giving birth God is birthing
[51:01] who God
[51:04] is it complicated this message is never
[51:06] complicated
[51:10] Hallelujah and God say let us make man
[51:13] in our image
[51:16] after our likeness
[51:19] and let them
[51:21] so this man is double
[51:24] he's plural he's not one man
[51:27] because the Bible says them
[51:31] if you look it looks like one man but
[51:33] it's two people
[51:36] we okay
[51:38] then
[51:39] we went through this before so you
[51:41] should be hollering amen quickly so we
[51:43] can move on Amen
[51:45] and let them have dominion
[51:50] over the fish of the sea
[51:54] and over the file of the earth that the
[51:57] air and over the cattle and over all the
[52:01] Earth and over every creeping thing that
[52:05] creepeth upon the Earth
[52:07] so when man
[52:10] is created by God
[52:13] he is created with the power to
[52:17] control
[52:21] are we reading the same Bible
[52:24] I'm reading King James version that's
[52:26] what brother Branham used
[52:28] are we reading the same Bible so man
[52:31] when he's created he is created to have
[52:35] dominion
[52:36] in other words when man is fabricated
[52:40] automatically he's fabricated with the
[52:43] power to have dominion
[52:47] to dominate
[52:50] Man was created to dominate
[52:54] not dominant man
[52:57] we are clear
[52:59] man was not created to dominate man he
[53:02] was created to dominate nature the file
[53:05] of the air the Beast of the field and
[53:07] thing when men begin to dominate
[53:09] somebody something is wrong then it's a
[53:11] nicolating spirit
[53:13] [Applause]
[53:15] everybody okay
[53:16] so the one you need to dominate is not
[53:19] your brother
[53:20] it's not your system you dominate the
[53:22] dog
[53:23] you got dominated the elephant when you
[53:26] go to the zoo then show your muscles
[53:31] everybody okay so man was given Dominion
[53:36] by birth
[53:42] amen
[53:43] so in you in all of you you have this
[53:47] potential
[53:49] all of you here have this potential
[53:52] whether you believe it or you don't want
[53:54] to believe it you have this potential
[53:57] even if you refuse it's already loaded
[54:00] in you
[54:04] when they fabricate the computer
[54:06] whatever a computer need is there
[54:08] whether you turn that computer on and
[54:10] not the potential is there
[54:12] all you have to do is hook the computer
[54:14] to the power
[54:16] then the software will begin to work so
[54:19] your software is already prepared
[54:23] program
[54:25] ordained
[54:27] predestinated
[54:29] to dominate amen
[54:33] so if you are dominated by something you
[54:37] don't know who you are
[54:38] [Music]
[54:39] [Applause]
[54:43] you should be always the head amen and
[54:47] never to tell amen if you either tell
[54:49] something is wrong the problem is you
[54:51] you letting somebody take over
[54:59] everybody okay
[55:02] oh my God job to verse 27 glory to God
[55:06] so God created her man in his own water
[55:10] image and in the image of who God and
[55:13] the Bible said the image of God is
[55:14] Christ
[55:17] then God who was creating man
[55:20] for to be more precise look like this
[55:23] light here
[55:25] the God that was created he looks like
[55:28] that
[55:30] the God that was creating was looking
[55:32] like God
[55:33] so when he was creating he was creating
[55:36] something that looked also like that
[55:40] that's why he's the Father of Lights
[55:44] because God is like
[55:46] so he was creating a theophany that
[55:49] looked like him
[55:50] [Applause]
[55:52] that's why that tea off and you already
[55:54] have power already hooked into him
[55:57] everybody okay
[56:00] we have to stretch you
[56:02] that's what they say in my word that's
[56:04] my language amen glory to God Amen and
[56:08] in his own image created he him how male
[56:13] and female so you see that man who was
[56:15] not really man the way we understand it
[56:18] in other words this even you sister you
[56:22] included in this
[56:26] if you say in Christ there is no
[56:30] because at the beginning when government
[56:32] when Man was created like Christ he was
[56:35] already male and female
[56:38] so when you look at Adam you don't know
[56:40] where which how is he because he's a
[56:43] light that's
[56:45] when we get in the body that when that's
[56:47] when you can make a difference so man is
[56:51] male
[56:52] and female
[56:54] so this Dominion is not only for men
[56:57] that's right it's for sisters also amen
[57:00] amen
[57:01] male and female created heat them amen
[57:08] verse 28.
[57:10] and God did what bless them stop why do
[57:14] you bless a god
[57:19] I thought man when he was created he
[57:22] already have dominion God already told
[57:24] him that I created you have fabricated
[57:26] you for you to dominate to have dominion
[57:29] why does he need a blessing why
[57:32] why do you bless God
[57:36] why does Jesus need the pillar of Fire
[57:42] in Jordan
[57:45] why does Judah need another baptism of
[57:49] Satan
[57:50] oh my God you remember yesterday right
[57:53] amen you remember yesterday right amen
[57:55] even though Judah was born the Son of
[57:58] Perdition for him to fulfill his mission
[58:01] he needed a permission from Jesus Christ
[58:04] Jesus gave him something to eat and the
[58:07] Bible said the devil enter him
[58:10] and even Jesus himself have to go to
[58:13] Jordan so that the pillar of fire can
[58:16] enter into him
[58:18] so being created give you already the
[58:21] engine
[58:24] but despite the engine you need
[58:28] something to activate
[58:30] you need the dynamic to activate it
[58:34] your potential is already there the
[58:37] reason why the potential are not
[58:39] operating because you have now receiving
[58:41] the blessing the blessing yet
[58:46] Man was created in the image and the
[58:49] likeness of God men look like God
[58:52] God created him to have dominion but
[58:55] before men begin to exercise that
[58:57] Dominion God have to bless him amen amen
[59:00] this blessing doesn't change the fact
[59:03] that you were already God
[59:10] there is a blessing that followed
[59:13] amen what is the purpose of this
[59:16] blessing
[59:20] Amen in other words there is a potential
[59:23] but that potential needs a blessing and
[59:26] when the blessing comes it kick in
[59:30] what is the purpose of this blessing why
[59:33] do you bless a god
[59:36] he's already God you already say you
[59:38] give him the Dominion why do you need to
[59:40] bless him again
[59:42] verse 28 and God blessed them
[59:46] not one bless both of them
[59:49] and God said to them
[59:51] amen
[59:52] be what fruitful and do whatever
[59:55] multiply and water replenish the Earth
[59:58] and do what subdue it and have water
[1:00:00] Dominion is this Dominion different than
[1:00:03] the one God put there no so this
[1:00:06] blessing
[1:00:07] is only to make you aware of what you of
[1:00:12] your abilities
[1:00:17] in other words the blessing that is
[1:00:20] coming is only to bring out what you
[1:00:24] already are
[1:00:28] everybody okay when you created you
[1:00:31] created for Dominion you have potentials
[1:00:36] amen
[1:00:37] so when the blessing is coming
[1:00:41] do you know that uh Jacob
[1:00:45] got the blessing
[1:00:47] amen he got the blessing and then he ran
[1:00:51] away
[1:00:51] but he was still suffering
[1:00:54] he was still working working and they
[1:00:56] changed his salary the first time the
[1:00:58] second time until he began even to cheat
[1:01:02] he thought he was under a curse
[1:01:05] but when he met the angel of the Lord he
[1:01:08] began to fight he was still looking for
[1:01:10] blessing
[1:01:11] did you see the angel blessing him again
[1:01:14] and saying Jacob I give you blessing
[1:01:16] did you see the angel blessing him the
[1:01:18] angel just changed his name
[1:01:23] that change of name
[1:01:26] finishes everything
[1:01:28] because Jacob was already blessed
[1:01:32] amen so we are already created with this
[1:01:35] when the blessing is coming it's only
[1:01:39] making you aware or bringing out or
[1:01:43] activating whatever God already loaded
[1:01:46] you into it
[1:01:48] if they say be fruitful
[1:01:52] means that in you you have fruit
[1:01:58] how can you be fruitful if you don't
[1:01:59] have food
[1:02:00] if they say be fruitful it means that
[1:02:02] you already have fruit it's up to you to
[1:02:05] find out how to bring those fruits out
[1:02:07] are we okay
[1:02:09] we clear so far so the Bible says God
[1:02:12] bless them and God say be fruitful and
[1:02:16] multiply and replenish the Earth and
[1:02:19] subdue it and have dominion over the
[1:02:22] fish of the sea and over the fall of the
[1:02:25] air he's repeating the same thing he
[1:02:27] already made man for that's why brother
[1:02:29] brought them say God man was a God of
[1:02:31] this Earth
[1:02:32] so God is only reminding God that hey
[1:02:35] this is the responsibility this is what
[1:02:37] you need to do this is what I created
[1:02:39] you for amen and the and the file of the
[1:02:42] years and every living thing that move
[1:02:44] upon the Earth everybody okay
[1:02:47] everybody good so far let's go to
[1:02:49] Matthew 13.
[1:02:52] so Man was created in the image in the
[1:02:57] likeness of God
[1:02:59] but despite that creation that give him
[1:03:02] potential he needed the blessing
[1:03:05] and the blessing to put into operation
[1:03:07] whatever potential was already created
[1:03:09] in him
[1:03:10] Jesus was God he was Emmanuel
[1:03:14] he was God being born but Jesus needed
[1:03:17] the Jordan he even
[1:03:18] before he can start his ministry
[1:03:21] even Judas needed Satan to enter to him
[1:03:24] when Satan entered Jesus say whatever
[1:03:26] you have to say to do go ahead and do it
[1:03:29] quickly
[1:03:30] because now you are anointed with the
[1:03:32] fullness of the devil badly
[1:03:36] brother Branham say Jesus Christ was God
[1:03:39] incarnated and Judah was Satan
[1:03:41] incarnated
[1:03:43] we okay now
[1:03:45] okay Matthew 13 verse 14.
[1:03:51] verse 15 Matthew 13 verse 15 if you dare
[1:03:54] you can say amen amen
[1:03:56] we went through this I'm going to draw
[1:03:58] something there for this people's heart
[1:04:00] is wax gross
[1:04:03] and their ears are dull of hearing and
[1:04:08] the eyes they have clothes less at any
[1:04:11] time they should do what see
[1:04:14] there is only three things that I want
[1:04:16] to draw there
[1:04:19] number one it's about the eyes
[1:04:22] you remember this
[1:04:24] to see and their ears
[1:04:29] you remember this right
[1:04:31] to here and the third one is what the
[1:04:33] heart
[1:04:37] what do you do with the heart can you
[1:04:39] read it
[1:04:40] understand
[1:04:41] you know do you see where you understand
[1:04:44] not here
[1:04:45] you understand here
[1:04:49] when you understand the message here
[1:04:52] it doesn't help you
[1:04:54] because the message Target is nothing is
[1:04:56] never here I shall send you Malachi for
[1:04:59] to turn the hearts
[1:05:02] when the message hit here then you
[1:05:03] understand the message by that
[1:05:05] understanding is not here it's called
[1:05:08] revelation
[1:05:11] amen let's say anytime they should see
[1:05:14] with their eyes and hear with their ears
[1:05:16] and should understand with the heart and
[1:05:19] should be have converted and I should do
[1:05:22] what to heal them so to be converted you
[1:05:24] must heal
[1:05:25] you must see and you must also
[1:05:28] understand with the heart all three need
[1:05:31] to be connected are we okay amen now
[1:05:34] let's go back to uh let's go down to
[1:05:36] verse 16. but blessed as your what eyes
[1:05:39] for the sea and your water ear for the
[1:05:42] water here did you see him talking about
[1:05:44] the heart that's why the disciple didn't
[1:05:46] receive the Holy Ghost until the day of
[1:05:48] Pentecost
[1:05:51] because if they already understood with
[1:05:54] their heart they should be converted
[1:05:56] that's why Jesus told Peter when you are
[1:05:59] converted
[1:06:01] go strengthen your brother because Peter
[1:06:04] was not converted yet he was converted
[1:06:07] when you received the Holy Ghost that's
[1:06:09] what brother Branham say we already went
[1:06:11] through this everybody okay we got those
[1:06:14] three elements remember let's go to John
[1:06:16] then we pray
[1:06:19] glory to God John chapter 4 it's a
[1:06:22] little bit lengthy
[1:06:26] let's pray because this is lengthy
[1:06:29] Heavenly Father Lord we are approaching
[1:06:31] you humbly this this morning Father once
[1:06:34] again thanking you for your grace your
[1:06:36] love and your mercy and for everything
[1:06:38] you have been doing for us father we are
[1:06:40] committing this service unto their hand
[1:06:42] may you move me completely out of the
[1:06:45] way may you come and speak to your
[1:06:47] children father and bless us may we
[1:06:49] depart from this church differently than
[1:06:51] the way we came in May you seal the
[1:06:54] devil and his army away from this place
[1:06:56] because your Prophet told us that Holy
[1:06:59] Angel also in Camp and they stay in the
[1:07:02] churches we believe that they were
[1:07:04] already here but we need your presence
[1:07:06] more than anything in the name of Jesus
[1:07:09] Christ amen
[1:07:11] John chapter 4 verse 7 if you dare you
[1:07:13] can say Amen
[1:07:16] there Kim comes a woman of Samaria
[1:07:22] to draw water
[1:07:24] the purpose she was coming was to draw
[1:07:27] water yes
[1:07:29] yes you keep that Jesus said to her give
[1:07:32] me to drink
[1:07:34] amen amen for his disciple were gone
[1:07:37] away to the city to buy meat
[1:07:40] then saved the woman of Samaria to him
[1:07:44] how is it that you being what a Jew what
[1:07:48] was the woman looking at
[1:07:50] flesh
[1:07:52] the Flesh of Jesus Christ
[1:07:56] are we together
[1:07:57] are we together
[1:07:59] so the contact of the flesh got the
[1:08:02] woman confused
[1:08:05] because Jesus decided to take the body
[1:08:10] of a Jew
[1:08:12] everybody okay so the first Contact of
[1:08:16] this woman
[1:08:17] the body contact
[1:08:19] of this woman she qualified or called
[1:08:22] Jesus Christ a Jew was really Jesus a
[1:08:26] Jew no
[1:08:28] amen Jesus was not a Jew
[1:08:33] let me help you up a lot of you
[1:08:35] [Laughter]
[1:08:38] that's that's why this message is
[1:08:40] different
[1:08:41] amen amen
[1:08:43] you are what you are but the blood of

[1:09:00] bread

[1:09:08] from which father
[1:09:13] which Jewish father contributed to the
[1:09:16] blood of Jesus Christ it's an Immaculate
[1:09:19] birth
[1:09:20] brother Branham saying brother Branham
[1:09:22] said the egg and the sperm both of them

[1:09:34] Jews that's why the blood of Jesus
[1:09:37] Christ can save everybody amen
[1:09:40] it is not a Jewish blood
[1:09:45] it is the very blood of God Amen that's
[1:09:49] why the blood of Christa is a precious
[1:09:51] blood amen because it's a blood of God
[1:09:54] God in human flesh
[1:09:58] he looked like a Jew but he was not a
[1:10:01] Jew so the first bull is very dangerous
[1:10:05] amen

[1:10:20] say the woman of Samaria to him how is
[1:10:22] it that you being a Jew ask me of drink

[1:10:34] you're a Jew or magenta didn't know that
[1:10:36] that was not really a Jew

[1:10:47] you in trouble
[1:10:49] if you arrest this you won't receive
[1:10:52] brother Branham
[1:10:53] [Applause]
[1:10:55] if you were racist you always say
[1:10:57] brother Brandon that's right but the
[1:10:59] color of brother Branham is not a
[1:11:00] problem to me because I know who was
[1:11:02] inside today amen
[1:11:05] [Applause]
[1:11:09] amen I don't identify God by the color
[1:11:13] of the skin but identify God by his
[1:11:16] characteristics amen when he can turn
[1:11:19] the back like this it is not a man it is
[1:11:23] not an American
[1:11:24] all right
[1:11:26] it is the Fulfillment of Genesis 18.

[1:11:30] [Applause]
[1:11:33] you will miss God by me because of the
[1:11:36] skin
[1:11:39] [Applause]
[1:11:44] he chose by his sovereignty to use an
[1:11:48] American
[1:11:49] that's it
[1:11:50] that is his choice all I say is amen
[1:11:53] amen
[1:11:56] that's the choice of God that is not
[1:11:58] your choice you are not there to advise
[1:12:01] him he's so fit to use an American
[1:12:11] amen
[1:12:13] for the Jew has not dealing with the
[1:12:16] water Samaritans Jesus answered and said
[1:12:19] to her if you knew
[1:12:21] the gift of God and who in other words
[1:12:25] you don't know
[1:12:26] who you talking to because you caught up
[1:12:28] into the flesh

[1:12:34] you knew the gift of God and who is it
[1:12:37] that says to you give me a water to
[1:12:40] drink you should have asked of him and
[1:12:43] he would have given you water Living
[1:12:45] Water so there is two
[1:12:48] well
[1:12:50] there is a world that existed there
[1:12:54] that Jesus asked for water
[1:12:56] and Jesus is moving the woman from a
[1:12:58] well a natural well to another well
[1:13:01] but the natural way for you to get water
[1:13:04] you need to have something to draw
[1:13:13] amen because the world is usually deep
[1:13:17] let me read it
[1:13:20] [Applause]
[1:13:22] amen amen
[1:13:24] let's go to verse 11. the woman said to

[1:13:39] the woman is saying that I see you you
[1:13:42] are talking about giving me water to
[1:13:45] begin with to have water you must have a
[1:13:48] tool
[1:13:50] to draw water
[1:13:51] the reason why you needed to because the
[1:13:54] wear is not superficial
[1:13:58] the well is deep
[1:14:00] correct amen amen so when the well is
[1:14:04] deep you must have something to draw
[1:14:06] with amen
[1:14:09] everybody okay when the whale is deeper
[1:14:13] when the well is deep whether it's a
[1:14:17] natural
[1:14:18] amen amen or it is a
[1:14:21] spiritual well amen we need the tool to
[1:14:26] draw
[1:14:27] [Applause]
[1:14:30] that is what we're dealing with today
[1:14:33] amen you need something to draw
[1:14:37] amen
[1:14:39] the woman had the war was needed to Joe
[1:14:42] welder from menacho well that's why
[1:14:45] Jesus asked him he said would you help
[1:14:48] me have water because she had the tomb
[1:14:50] and she looked at Jesus and Jesus said
[1:14:52] you know what
[1:14:53] yeah if you knew who I am you would have
[1:14:57] asked me to give you water so the woman
[1:14:59] thought that Jesus is talking about the
[1:15:01] same way and the woman say but
[1:15:04] you want to give me worthy I don't even
[1:15:06] see you with a bucket
[1:15:09] how are you going to draw water and give
[1:15:12] it to me
[1:15:13] amen if a natural well need a natural
[1:15:16] bucket or a natural bucket to draw the
[1:15:21] spiritual aware also need the bucket

[1:15:42] click this right here by the Angelo
[1:15:45] if you can please my brother thank you
[1:15:48] amen
[1:15:49] thank you very much amen the Bible says
[1:15:52] verse 11 the woman thank you my brother

[1:15:59] the world is how the remember that
[1:16:03] from where then have you that living
[1:16:06] water water
[1:16:08] are you greater than our father Jacob
[1:16:11] which gave us the well I can get to this
[1:16:14] because it's another sermon and drunk
[1:16:16] thereof himself and his children and his
[1:16:18] cattle
[1:16:20] Jesus answered and said to her whosoever
[1:16:23] drink of water this water shall do water
[1:16:26] and thirst again because it's a natural
[1:16:28] water
[1:16:29] amen so there is a natural thirst
[1:16:34] and a spiritual test remember we already
[1:16:37] talked about tests
[1:16:39] because test is the Deep calling to the
[1:16:41] Deep amen you cannot test if you don't
[1:16:44] have water in you
[1:16:46] so whatever you taste is already new
[1:16:49] [Applause]
[1:16:50] [Music]
[1:16:53] whatever you are testing is already on
[1:16:56] you
[1:16:57] it's a deep that is calling to a deeper
[1:17:01] glory to God
[1:17:03] verse 14 but whosoever drink of the
[1:17:07] water that I shall give him shall never
[1:17:09] thirst so you see the different tests
[1:17:12] but the water that I shall give him
[1:17:14] shall be in him a what oh well
[1:17:18] of water so when that what they're
[1:17:20] getting you it becomes a well
[1:17:23] so actually they are putting a well in
[1:17:26] you
[1:17:30] that was there doesn't come itself
[1:17:34] when I put this water in you and then
[1:17:37] the word that comes with the bottle
[1:17:42] everybody okay
[1:17:45] and that shall give him aware of water
[1:17:48] springing up into water Everlasting so
[1:17:51] everlasting life begin to come from that
[1:17:53] well
[1:17:54] that's why you can impart life
[1:17:57] [Music]
[1:17:59] [Applause]

[1:18:06] hand on somebody else
[1:18:07] and they can get the Holy Ghost
[1:18:14] you are dispatched
[1:18:15] [Applause]
[1:18:18] it's like a franchise
[1:18:21] [Applause]
[1:18:25] oh my God
[1:18:27] Lord help me verse 15 the woman said to
[1:18:30] him sir give me water this one now the

[1:19:01] husband and come where hither Jesus is
[1:19:04] already changing gears to the second
[1:19:06] Pole
[1:19:09] because Jesus already discerned the
[1:19:12] woman and saw what was wrong in her life
[1:19:14] so the gear I already changed to the
[1:19:17] second pool
[1:19:19] we okay okay no problem I hope I don't
[1:19:23] want to lose anyone verse 17 the woman

[1:19:34] have no husband for you have how five
[1:19:36] husbands that's the second pool
[1:19:38] discerning five husband and he whom you

[1:19:43] uh whom you now have is not your husband
[1:19:47] in that say you truly watch again at the
[1:19:51] beginning the woman said that being a
[1:19:54] now watch what the second pool is doing
[1:19:56] to the woman
[1:19:58] amen amen amen the second pool is moving
[1:20:03] her up watch what the second pool does
[1:20:05] verse 19 the woman said to him sir I
[1:20:10] perceive that there are water a prophet
[1:20:12] is not enough
[1:20:13] ah oh my God
[1:20:18] it's not a mafia
[1:20:21] [Applause]
[1:20:24] not the second the second the spirit of
[1:20:27] the woman when he was contacted amen he
[1:20:31] unfolded the woman he brought the woman
[1:20:34] to a prophetic level
[1:20:36] he said now thou art a prophet no longer
[1:20:40] a Jew because the characteristic you are
[1:20:43] displaying is not a normal Jew
[1:20:46] it's a characteristic of a prophet amen
[1:20:50] and that was fulfilled by the second
[1:20:52] Paul
[1:20:53] if you notice
[1:20:56] if you look look at verse 9 the Bible
[1:21:00] say then says the woman of Samaria
[1:21:03] to him how is it that that being what a
[1:21:06] Jew it's verse nine because the
[1:21:09] numerology of the Bible don't pray it's
[1:21:11] verse 9 is a Jew amen God to 19.
[1:21:20] [Applause]
[1:21:23] so let me put 29 down here
[1:21:29] so every time we go 10 something open
[1:21:34] I keep 20 now but we are not in 29 yet
[1:21:37] everybody okay
[1:21:39] we okay
[1:21:40] we okay
[1:21:41] that is still knowing that he's a Jew
[1:21:45] didn't help her
[1:21:48] amen knowing that he's a prophet still
[1:21:52] doesn't help the woman but he already
[1:21:55] prepared the woman
[1:22:01] everybody okay you need to go beyond the
[1:22:04] prophet
[1:22:06] yes
[1:22:09] yes sir
[1:22:13] an American is not enough
[1:22:18] a prophet is good but it's not enough
[1:22:22] you need to see beyond the prophet
[1:22:27] what you see beyond the prophet that's
[1:22:30] what gives you life
[1:22:34] everybody okay glory to God
[1:22:40] how many people believe that brother
[1:22:42] Branham was a prophet they say brother
[1:22:43] Brown and we believe Prophet we
[1:22:45] understand by the prophet but what you
[1:22:47] preaching we don't want to take it right
[1:22:48] now
[1:22:54] only a rainbow
[1:22:59] and fly that level
[1:23:00] in other words Jesus is pulling
[1:23:04] until she get to where he wants
[1:23:06] everybody okay verse 20 Lord help me for
[1:23:10] our father our fathers worshiping this
[1:23:13] mountain you say that in Jerusalem is
[1:23:15] the place where men ought to worship
[1:23:17] Jesus said to a woman believe me they
[1:23:20] are our cometh when you shall neither in
[1:23:23] this mountain nor Atwater Jerusalem
[1:23:26] worship the father you worship you know
[1:23:29] not what we know what we worship for
[1:23:32] salvation is of the water Jews
[1:23:35] let me skip quickly amen job to verse 24
[1:23:39] God is a water a spirit and they that
[1:23:42] worship he must worship him where in
[1:23:44] spirit and what in truth you already
[1:23:46] know this watch verse 25 the woman said
[1:23:50] to him I know that water Messiah coming
[1:23:56] now the conversation is no longer a
[1:23:58] prophet
[1:24:03] because when they ask John the Baptist
[1:24:05] the question they say are you one of the
[1:24:08] prophets or are you him
[1:24:11] that he means the Messiah
[1:24:13] the Messiah is not a prophet he is the
[1:24:17] prophet
[1:24:20] he is the god of the prophet
[1:24:24] so the conversation now is changing the
[1:24:28] woman is now climbing into a different
[1:24:30] level like wait a minute
[1:24:32] amen this is no more discernment but the
[1:24:36] preaching the opening of the world that
[1:24:39] is coming up is pulling the woman into a
[1:24:41] level like
[1:24:43] this kind of talking only the Messiah
[1:24:46] should do something like that
[1:24:49] [Applause]
[1:24:51] Jesus say okay the target is zero go
[1:24:55] ahead and shoot
[1:24:57] when you shoot there to kill
[1:25:02] it's a it's a third when you pull that
[1:25:04] the fish have to come out everybody okay
[1:25:07] verse 25 the woman say I know that
[1:25:11] Messiah cometh which is called how
[1:25:13] Christ look how the woman Cramer
[1:25:19] if you notice the woman is talking
[1:25:22] vaguely
[1:25:24] in other words she understand that there
[1:25:26] is a messiah that need to come but
[1:25:29] that's not good enough
[1:25:30] she need to take the Messiah and put it
[1:25:33] on Jesus
[1:25:38] knowing that the Messiah cometh is fine
[1:25:40] you must identify who is the Messiah
[1:25:43] [Applause]
[1:25:44] [Music]
[1:25:48] [Applause]
[1:25:51] just as you identify him as a Jew you
[1:25:55] identify him as a prophet your own mouth
[1:25:58] have to identify him as the Messiah
[1:26:00] [Applause]
[1:26:05] everybody good
[1:26:07] everybody good okay praise God
[1:26:10] ah man we are 25
[1:26:13] when he comes he will tell us what all
[1:26:17] things stop
[1:26:18] the Messiah doesn't give you things in
[1:26:22] portion
[1:26:24] that's right
[1:26:27] when the Messiah come he will cover
[1:26:30] everything
[1:26:32] when you see a Ministry that cover
[1:26:34] everything that can tell you everything
[1:26:38] [Music]
[1:26:38] [Applause]
[1:26:42] a Ministry that opened the entire world
[1:26:46] the entire Bible from Genesis to
[1:26:50] Revelation is open that's a messiah
[1:26:53] oh
[1:26:57] yeah
[1:27:01] it is a masalic Ministry
[1:27:08] I'm not talking about this man
[1:27:11] I'm talking about the one on top of the
[1:27:13] man
[1:27:17] [Applause]
[1:27:21] the reason why this man have to be used
[1:27:24] because the body of Jesus is locked
[1:27:28] if the body of Jesus move it triggered
[1:27:31] the rapture
[1:27:34] normally Jesus himself was supposed to
[1:27:37] do that because he did it to the Jews
[1:27:40] and the Samaritan but because of the
[1:27:43] Rapture they have to borrow somebody
[1:27:45] that's why brother Branham said he
[1:27:48] borrowed
[1:27:49] brother brother means not the body of
[1:27:51] Jesus Christ it's a borrowed body
[1:27:55] to reveal a son of man revealing
[1:28:00] [Applause]
[1:28:11] I'm trying to go back to what I'm trying
[1:28:13] to prepare today
[1:28:15] amen
[1:28:18] so a minute when the Messiah cometh he
[1:28:21] will show you
[1:28:26] the full world is connected to the
[1:28:29] Messiah
[1:28:30] because faith has been lost
[1:28:33] but a promise say that Elijah succumb
[1:28:37] and restore
[1:28:44] how can Elijah restore all things
[1:28:47] but but all things belong to the
[1:28:49] ministry of the Messiah so that's a
[1:28:51] larger Ministry
[1:28:53] [Applause]
[1:28:55] [Music]
[1:28:55] [Applause]
[1:28:58] that's why brother Branham said the
[1:29:01] Elijah of this day
[1:29:04] is the Lord Jesus Christ but he has to
[1:29:07] come through a prophet
[1:29:10] he said it's a channel
[1:29:15] [Applause]
[1:29:16] is he complicated
[1:29:19] is it complicated
[1:29:22] oh God help me up where am I at verse 26
[1:29:27] Jesus said to her I that speak to you I
[1:29:31] am he now Jesus tell her Jesus himself
[1:29:35] revealed to her
[1:29:39] no nobody told him
[1:29:42] if you ask her how do you know Jesus is
[1:29:44] Christ he won't tell you P they told me
[1:29:47] he will not tell you brother Stephen
[1:29:50] said
[1:29:51] me myself
[1:29:54] me myself
[1:29:56] he told me he revealed to me myself
[1:30:00] that he is the messiah
[1:30:03] and he is the word of God and when the
[1:30:06] word open up and revealed to you nobody
[1:30:10] need to tell you anything else
[1:30:13] [Music]
[1:30:13] [Applause]
[1:30:14] [Music]
[1:30:15] [Applause]
[1:30:20] I'm preaching something different my
[1:30:22] friend let me ask you a question did you
[1:30:24] see Jesus praying for that woman
[1:30:27] did you see Jesus casting out the devil
[1:30:30] he cast therefore he marry Magdalene but
[1:30:33] not this one
[1:30:38] so when the World opened up to you
[1:30:44] he remove all the Devils amen amen
[1:30:51] [Applause]
[1:30:52] that's what
[1:30:54] that's why brother Branham said there is
[1:30:57] no higher form of God
[1:30:59] to reveal them his word when the World
[1:31:02] opened up you don't need to be prayful
[1:31:05] [Applause]
[1:31:10] the woman never say okay now that I know
[1:31:13] you the Messiah go ahead and pray for me
[1:31:15] and remove this prostitution Spirit no
[1:31:19] if I know you the Messiah the
[1:31:21] prostitution spirit is already gone
[1:31:24] [Music]
[1:31:29] this is the difference between us and
[1:31:32] the Pentecost amen
[1:31:37] it is the opening of the world
[1:31:42] [Applause]
[1:31:48] when did she when she saw it do you know
[1:31:51] what she did nobody told her job
[1:31:54] in either one by seeing that the party's
[1:31:57] already done
[1:31:59] [Applause]
[1:32:03] now she begins to testify
[1:32:06] so when the Revelation come it puts you
[1:32:09] in testimony amen
[1:32:14] [Applause]
[1:32:22] it's a personal revelation
[1:32:26] of Jesus Christ to you
[1:32:28] [Applause]
[1:32:30] nobody between that

[1:34:35] yeah
[1:34:36] everybody okay everybody good my subject

[1:35:10] amen when that Spirit come in your life
[1:35:13] and enter into your life amen it is just
[1:35:16] a starting point you remember that I
[1:35:18] gave you quotes from Brother Branham and
[1:35:20] everything
[1:35:21] and once that started break started what
[1:35:25] happened is the Holy Ghost get into you
[1:35:26] and releases the love of God we sin that
[1:35:30] I gave you quote and everything amen and
[1:35:33] first of all before even that he will
[1:35:36] circumcise you because we have uh you
[1:35:39] need the circumcision of the heart we

[1:35:43] Surplus the excess of the flesh remove a
[1:35:46] Stony heart amen releases the love of
[1:35:49] God and when the love of God is released
[1:35:51] into you it brings the bond of
[1:35:53] perfectness you remember that you and
[1:35:56] God you are married and it's finished
[1:35:57] and brother Branham say when that love
[1:36:00] come if you remember last Sunday that
[1:36:03] love will cast out fear
[1:36:06] you remember that because the Bible said
[1:36:08] perfect love casts out water and brother
[1:36:11] Branham said when the fear is removed
[1:36:14] amen then love will produce faith
[1:36:19] because the great commandment need to be
[1:36:21] fulfilled in your life only the Holy
[1:36:23] Spirit can fulfill it the holy spirit
[1:36:25] will make you walk keep and do the will
[1:36:28] of God you remember last Sunday amen and
[1:36:31] the last thing the holy spirit will come
[1:36:33] is remove fear completely from you and
[1:36:36] when fear is removed brother Branham say
[1:36:37] the holy spirit will be places fear by
[1:36:40] faith or by revelation
[1:36:44] Faith by definition in Hebrew 11 verse 1
[1:36:49] the Bible says that Faith you know this
[1:36:53] now is the substance
[1:36:56] everybody okay go to Hebrew 11 my friend
[1:37:00] so we can climb up now
[1:37:05] the Bible say in Hebrew 11 verse 1 now
[1:37:09] Faith is what the substance
[1:37:14] faith is a substance
[1:37:18] a substance
[1:37:21] we all quoted this for years
[1:37:23] amen faith is the substance
[1:37:28] of water things hoped for
[1:37:31] and the water the evidence of water
[1:37:33] Things Not Seen so we got two worlds
[1:37:38] that are hidden water
[1:37:40] we have an invisible world
[1:37:44] and a visible word
[1:37:47] you have a world of the Unseen
[1:37:51] or the invisible
[1:37:54] amen or the imaginary
[1:37:58] amen
[1:38:00] this is where we hope
[1:38:05] because you don't see what you're hoping
[1:38:06] for
[1:38:07] everybody okay
[1:38:09] and we have another world that is the
[1:38:12] word of the visible
[1:38:15] amen or a material
[1:38:19] all natural world
[1:38:21] amen this is where you see things like I
[1:38:25] see this chair I see this point I can
[1:38:28] touch the boy all of these are visible
[1:38:31] amen now the Bible says that faith is
[1:38:35] the substance the substance of things
[1:38:39] hopeful
[1:38:41] amen so before
[1:38:44] something become Faith he was actually
[1:38:47] in an unseen way
[1:38:53] are we together
[1:38:55] before something become faithful it
[1:38:58] usually starts as a hope
[1:39:01] it starts as an imagination
[1:39:04] it starts as something that you are
[1:39:07] thinking in your mind
[1:39:11] you want to get married one day
[1:39:14] are you married now
[1:39:15] is still in your mind it's hope
[1:39:19] amen where is your wife I don't see her
[1:39:22] where's she at do you know her you don't
[1:39:24] know all you know is something is there
[1:39:27] I'm gonna get married it's just a hope
[1:39:31] that hope doesn't help you
[1:39:36] man the fact he can torment you
[1:39:41] everybody okay he can trouble you
[1:39:43] especially young sister because they
[1:39:45] want to get married they want to get
[1:39:47] married he looks like marriage is
[1:39:48] somewhere but they don't have the man
[1:39:52] everybody okay everybody good now Faith
[1:39:56] is the substance of what you are hoping
[1:40:00] for
[1:40:01] but it's also an Evidence of what you
[1:40:06] have not seen yet
[1:40:07] in other words in between the invisible
[1:40:11] and the visible word faith is laying
[1:40:14] ready
[1:40:16] in other words faith is the state
[1:40:21] in between the invisible and the visible
[1:40:25] world
[1:40:27] Have I Lost somebody
[1:40:29] in other words when you hoping for
[1:40:31] something before that which you hope
[1:40:34] become material you have to go through
[1:40:37] the channel of faith
[1:40:40] everybody okay
[1:40:42] in other word when something leave hope
[1:40:46] or leave the invisible and become a
[1:40:50] substance he exists
[1:40:55] everybody okay if something reached the
[1:40:59] level of Faith you are 100
[1:41:03] guaranteed that's nothing existence
[1:41:08] everybody okay as long as it's not
[1:41:11] faithful it's a speculation
[1:41:13] he might or might not happen but once he
[1:41:17] reached the level of Faith a substance
[1:41:19] it will happen
[1:41:21] the problem is you don't see it yet
[1:41:25] so this substance help you understand
[1:41:28] that you already gathered even though
[1:41:31] you don't see it yet
[1:41:33] that's why it's a substance of things
[1:41:35] hoped for the evidence of what you have
[1:41:38] not seen yet so faith is what quieting
[1:41:42] your nerve
[1:41:44] [Applause]
[1:41:45] [Music]
[1:41:50] everybody okay everybody good everybody
[1:41:54] okay so far so faith is the substance
[1:41:57] the substance of what what you are
[1:41:59] hoping for
[1:42:00] when he moved from hope it is no longer
[1:42:03] here it is standing right there when he
[1:42:06] stand here safe tells you that you got
[1:42:08] it
[1:42:10] but if brother Benjamin asked you where
[1:42:13] is it you don't you cannot show it to
[1:42:16] brother Benjamin but you can see it
[1:42:20] you don't see it with your eyes
[1:42:22] you see it with a different eye
[1:42:26] everybody okay
[1:42:28] everybody good
[1:42:29] so when we say substance what is a
[1:42:33] substance
[1:42:36] William Marion Branham brother Branham
[1:42:40] say it's been said and it's true that
[1:42:43] coward
[1:42:44] died ten thousand times where a hero
[1:42:47] Never Dies
[1:42:51] I'm reading brother Branham so you say
[1:42:54] Amen to the prophet
[1:42:56] God wants people who are How brave and
[1:43:00] can take the water stand if anything
[1:43:02] that Christ could not use in his kingdom
[1:43:05] will be a water coward
[1:43:08] so if you are a coward you need to deal
[1:43:11] with that spirit
[1:43:13] amen
[1:43:14] a coward is a man that always look at
[1:43:17] the negative side
[1:43:18] [Applause]
[1:43:19] [Music]
[1:43:22] [Applause]
[1:43:24] every time you bring him a project he
[1:43:27] will talk more about the failure versus
[1:43:31] the the the the success
[1:43:36] in other words he doesn't want to try
[1:43:39] anything
[1:43:40] he want to stay in the comfort zone
[1:43:43] he doesn't want to progression he's
[1:43:46] comfortable with mediocrity
[1:43:48] [Applause]
[1:43:54] if you tell him do this he doesn't want
[1:43:56] it because it's too much headache
[1:43:59] and he will show you what about this
[1:44:01] happened what about this happen what
[1:44:02] about this happen but what about if he
[1:44:05] work
[1:44:06] remember
[1:44:07] amen
[1:44:11] not to stay around somebody who's
[1:44:13] negative
[1:44:14] [Applause]
[1:44:18] it's a negative vibration
[1:44:21] you wanna do something don't do it be
[1:44:24] careful what I have a big God Amen

[1:44:31] God doesn't want to lose coward
[1:44:38] [Applause]
[1:44:41] everybody okay glory to God brother
[1:44:45] Branham say have water faith in God the
[1:44:48] first place we should find out what
[1:44:50] faith is
[1:44:51] the Bible says that faith is water the
[1:44:54] substance of water things hoped for and
[1:44:56] it is water the evidence of water things
[1:44:59] not seen this little word faith get
[1:45:02] mixed up a lot of time with water oh
[1:45:04] Hope and Faith they are just as much
[1:45:07] water different as water days from night
[1:45:16] faith is water the substance and hope is
[1:45:19] water what you're hoping for
[1:45:22] faith is here hope is over there
[1:45:25] Faith do water delivers

[1:46:41] [Music]
[1:46:43] amen William Marion Branham he says
[1:46:47] faith being the water substance of water
[1:46:50] things hopes for then it would not just
[1:46:53] be a water at all fat is an imagination
[1:46:57] it would not be a water at all but it's
[1:47:00] water a substance now a substance is
[1:47:03] something that you can have
[1:47:05] let's clarify this a little bit more
[1:47:08] William Marion Branham my scripture
[1:47:11] lesson to not say faith is the substance
[1:47:14] of water things hoped for the evidence
[1:47:16] of water Things Not Seen It is water a
[1:47:19] substance it is something Direct
[1:47:24] something that you really have
[1:47:26] amen not something that you imagine
[1:47:30] something that you think you have but
[1:47:33] it's some direct positive at that water
[1:47:36] that's why I say faith is 100 guarantee
[1:47:41] amen
[1:47:43] William Marion pranam he said faith is
[1:47:48] different than what you think it is
[1:47:50] or not what you I mean the average
[1:47:52] person would think mostly it is Hope
[1:47:56] instead of faith you have a mental
[1:48:00] conception of faithful what it means
[1:48:02] immense and mentally you have faith but
[1:48:06] you go deeper than that you go away
[1:48:08] remember the world is away
[1:48:11] faith is water
[1:48:14] that's why you don't want to stay around
[1:48:16] negative
[1:48:17] it is a water the substance not a mess
[1:48:20] not an intellectual imagination but it
[1:48:24] is water a substance and a substance is
[1:48:28] something that you can hold on to amen
[1:48:33] in other words faith is your anchor amen
[1:48:37] when you have faithful
[1:48:39] even though the wind is blowing self is
[1:48:43] what you hold on to it
[1:48:49] if you have hope the wind will take you
[1:48:51] away
[1:48:52] only fat can resist the wind
[1:48:55] [Music]
[1:48:58] everybody okay
[1:49:00] why is this Faith here important why
[1:49:04] glory to God listen to brother Branham
[1:49:07] they said that nothing is impossible to
[1:49:11] who God God said nothing is impossible
[1:49:14] with who you
[1:49:21] we wanna know who is the you
[1:49:26] who is the you that nothing is
[1:49:28] impossible this is the you
[1:49:31] if you want to believe
[1:49:36] not with God but with who you so that
[1:49:39] you is the you that believe
[1:49:46] let's go to the Book of Mark chapter 9.
[1:49:51] glory to God
[1:49:54] let's go to Mark chapter 9 because we're
[1:49:57] dealing with faith
[1:49:59] faith
[1:50:03] is a substance a substance of things
[1:50:06] hopeful
[1:50:08] in evidence of what you don't see
[1:50:10] Faith delivers
[1:50:12] faith is what you can hold on to it amen
[1:50:15] and brother Branham say we usually say
[1:50:18] nothing is impossible with God but God
[1:50:21] is saying nothing is impossible to you
[1:50:24] we need to know when is nothing
[1:50:26] impossible to you when
[1:50:29] what makes you what makes you you which
[1:50:33] a level where everything you want to
[1:50:35] work
[1:50:37] because everything God wants he will do
[1:50:40] it
[1:50:41] nothing me when they say nothing is
[1:50:44] impossible to God it means that God can
[1:50:47] do anything
[1:50:49] if God wants to create a chair he will
[1:50:52] create it
[1:50:53] if God wants to appear now he will
[1:50:55] appear there is nothing that is
[1:50:58] impossible to God but now we need to
[1:51:00] know when is nothing impossible to us
[1:51:03] Mark 9 verse 22 if you dare you can say
[1:51:07] amen amen you there
[1:51:09] amen Jesus said to him what if thou
[1:51:13] can't believe
[1:51:16] so if you can believe
[1:51:19] if you can have faith
[1:51:23] amen
[1:51:25] let's go Kama then all things are
[1:51:28] possible to him that believeth
[1:51:32] so faith is the key that makes all
[1:51:36] things possible to you
[1:51:41] in other words if you want to do
[1:51:43] something find faithful
[1:51:45] if you find Faith whatever you need
[1:51:50] there won't be anything that can block
[1:51:53] you if you find faithful faith is what
[1:51:57] makes you like God
[1:51:59] [Applause]
[1:52:04] created the world by believing his own
[1:52:07] word that's what brother Branham saying
[1:52:09] the word was framed by the word of God
[1:52:12] the things that are visible were made by
[1:52:15] invisible
[1:52:17] God use Faith to be important so that
[1:52:21] nothing can be impossible to him
[1:52:23] faith is what make you act like God
[1:52:26] [Applause]
[1:52:30] everybody okay so if you have faith
[1:52:34] nothing is impossible to you
[1:52:38] that's why the Bible say it is
[1:52:40] impossible to please God without water
[1:52:43] so when God found faith in you God begin
[1:52:46] to Rejoice he say now I don't have to do
[1:52:49] anything
[1:52:50] that man can do everything just like me
[1:52:58] I'm mine brother Branham say deity is
[1:53:01] where
[1:53:06] the very God that stood but there on a
[1:53:09] medical platform mythical platform of
[1:53:12] The Eternity and raw water worlds
[1:53:16] so the man that was saying let there be
[1:53:18] let there be let there be let there be
[1:53:21] words off of his hand and created these
[1:53:24] things give you the water privilege to
[1:53:26] be what his son we know what the Son of
[1:53:29] God means a son of a dog is a dog
[1:53:32] a son of a goat is a goat a Son of God
[1:53:36] is God
[1:53:39] we already went through this amen and
[1:53:42] you are a part of him and God dwell away
[1:53:44] in mankind and man himself is water
[1:53:48] deity in the beginning Man was created
[1:53:51] in the image and the likeness of her God
[1:53:56] Hallelujah there you are he might shock
[1:53:59] you
[1:54:00] but study over that a little while
[1:54:02] god dwelled well in a man and man become
[1:54:06] a Son of God not him himself but who the
[1:54:10] holy spirit that is where in him is
[1:54:12] water God the Creator lives where in the
[1:54:16] creation oh my how I think of that then
[1:54:19] stand with a water unwavering faith and
[1:54:22] ask what you will and he shall be water
[1:54:24] down unto you there he is God there he
[1:54:28] is amen the problem is this
[1:54:32] but the trouble of it is with science
[1:54:35] they are moving on and we preacher are
[1:54:37] doing water setting still
[1:54:45] we got iphone 5 iphone 6 iPhone 7 iPhone
[1:54:49] 8 whatever message believer there it is
[1:54:57] Glory together that's it they move up
[1:55:00] until they can do whatever explaining
[1:55:02] Adam but we named Divine Healing or
[1:55:04] something another well see what Moody
[1:55:08] said about her what doctor so-and-so
[1:55:10] said they were all right in their age we
[1:55:12] are moving on science can only climb as
[1:55:15] far and it falls back we got the
[1:55:18] unsearchable
[1:55:19] [Applause]
[1:55:24] untapped resources younger but they
[1:55:27] think of it is they have to look back
[1:55:28] and see if their school part started
[1:55:35] don't let any preacher limit yourself
[1:55:41] in this message it's the preacher don't
[1:55:44] don't believe it that's his problem
[1:55:47] you believe our faith
[1:55:51] Jesus Jesus was God
[1:55:54] okay Jesus was God and Jesus said the
[1:55:58] work that I do me God you shall do it
[1:56:01] even how greater if I can do something
[1:56:04] greater than Jesus who are you to limit
[1:56:06] what I can do
[1:56:08] foreign
[1:56:15] there is no territory in this message
[1:56:18] that you can block me to access whatever
[1:56:22] the message say belong to me
[1:56:26] if the pastor don't believe it that's
[1:56:29] his problem
[1:56:30] take the full world
[1:56:32] [Applause]
[1:56:37] Lord help me I don't care what this

[2:02:21] before you go back
[2:02:29] why is this Faith important
[2:02:31] why is the faith important Lord help me
[2:02:34] listen to brother Branham 63 brother
[2:02:37] Branham say God secret mystery
[2:02:41] he had one before the world began now
[2:02:46] back in the water back part of what
[2:02:49] God's mind not the front part of God
[2:02:56] so God has a front mind and a back mind
[2:03:06] you are so amazed like God
[2:03:09] you also have a front mind and a Batman
[2:03:12] but as a man thinking boy in his heart
[2:03:16] the back minded
[2:03:18] that's why brother pranam say there is a
[2:03:21] conscious
[2:03:22] a first consensus
[2:03:26] and a subconscious
[2:03:29] a subconscious is a conscious below the
[2:03:33] first conscience is your mind
[2:03:36] that is operated by your brain
[2:03:38] but the subconscious brother Branham
[2:03:40] said it's your soul
[2:03:42] that's why you understand with your
[2:03:45] heart
[2:03:47] everybody okay so there is a mind and a
[2:03:51] mind a mind on top and a mind under
[2:03:56] there is a front mind and a backpack
[2:04:00] mind
[2:04:03] everybody okay the front man is in your
[2:04:06] brain that's your intellect but the bad
[2:04:09] part is in your heart
[2:04:11] that's what Jesus said have faith in
[2:04:13] water whatever you believe if you say to
[2:04:16] this mountain and believe where in your
[2:04:18] heart in the back part
[2:04:21] not in the front in the back part
[2:04:24] if I lost somebody
[2:04:26] have I lost someone but the problem say
[2:04:29] God also in the back part of God's mind
[2:04:33] there was something that was true that
[2:04:36] he was trying and was going to achieve
[2:04:39] and he had the water a motor in doing it
[2:04:42] in order to let himself Be Water Express
[2:04:46] so the back part Mind Of God had a
[2:04:49] mystery
[2:04:52] in other words when God speak there was
[2:04:55] another part of God
[2:04:58] that was deep
[2:04:59] in the back part that God never say
[2:05:02] anything about it
[2:05:04] God just kept quiet
[2:05:07] he would just say you know what
[2:05:09] day Israel will be taken to Egypt
[2:05:12] and they will stay there for 40 100
[2:05:14] years and I would deliver them with a
[2:05:17] mighty hand that is the front part of
[2:05:19] God
[2:05:21] everybody can read it
[2:05:23] and that and and understand that that
[2:05:26] Israel will go to Egypt and God will
[2:05:28] deliver them what does deliver means
[2:05:31] in the backpacked man of God when God
[2:05:35] said I will deliver them with a mighty
[2:05:37] hand the back part of man of God has
[2:05:40] Moses
[2:05:43] the front path said I would deliver them
[2:05:46] with a mighty hand that's why Moses
[2:05:49] could be put in the hand of pharaoh and
[2:05:51] Pharaoh doesn't kill him because the bad
[2:05:54] part man of God is sealed
[2:05:56] [Music]
[2:06:00] you have not called me yet
[2:06:02] you have not understood yet let me and
[2:06:05] make you understand better when God say
[2:06:08] Israel will go to Egypt after 400 years
[2:06:12] I will come and deliver them you should
[2:06:15] ask God the question how are you going
[2:06:16] to deliver them who are you going to use
[2:06:19] to deliver them and what do you mean by
[2:06:21] Mighty hand all of that is love it's in
[2:06:25] the Park part man
[2:06:27] in other words your father said go to
[2:06:30] school I will take care of that you
[2:06:32] heard go to school but I would take care
[2:06:35] of that doesn't mean what you hear it
[2:06:37] means at 10 AM daddy will swing by you
[2:06:40] in school and pay the school fee and get
[2:06:42] out daddy don't tell you that he just
[2:06:45] say you go to school
[2:06:48] everybody okay the back path man of God
[2:06:51] is what control everything
[2:06:55] everybody okay because the bad part Mind
[2:06:59] Of God was sealed
[2:07:02] do you follow me do you follow me the
[2:07:05] devil didn't know who God is going to
[2:07:09] use
[2:07:10] [Applause]
[2:07:13] everybody okay
[2:07:15] he doesn't know is it this he said you
[2:07:17] know what those Hebrew children begin to
[2:07:20] kill them
[2:07:22] and he did it in the time of Jesus
[2:07:24] Christ he didn't know who Jesus was but
[2:07:27] he can tell by the front part that the
[2:07:30] prophecy is about to happen but where is
[2:07:32] this child he doesn't know he said you
[2:07:34] know what how old is he he should be
[2:07:36] around two years two years every child
[2:07:39] from two years down weapon
[2:07:41] per Adventure I can catch that one so he
[2:07:45] thought he's gonna wipe the children and
[2:07:48] they start taking the children to the
[2:07:49] crocodile the back part of man have
[2:07:52] something different
[2:07:53] because the back part of Mind was locked
[2:07:56] God took Moses and sent him to Old
[2:07:59] pharaoh
[2:08:06] and Gabrielle came Gabriel came he said
[2:08:09] father what are you doing what he said
[2:08:12] Gabriel give me a Coca-Cola
[2:08:16] I'm just paraphrasing God opened his
[2:08:19] Coca-Cola and say let let Moses go he
[2:08:23] said but they're going to kill him he
[2:08:24] say the plan is here
[2:08:27] [Applause]
[2:08:29] everybody okay everybody okay Mercy who
[2:08:33] who directed The Sheep of Moses towards
[2:08:36] pharaoh it's a GPS that is greater than
[2:08:39] what we have
[2:08:40] God put the GPS and loaded and it's
[2:08:44] going well towards Pharaoh Pharaoh took
[2:08:46] and nourished his own enemy
[2:08:49] [Applause]
[2:08:55] a fellow knew that the man who's gonna
[2:08:58] destroy Egypt is that baby that is
[2:09:01] crying right there he would have killed
[2:09:03] it but he can't kill it because the back
[2:09:06] part of what is him
[2:09:08] [Applause]
[2:09:12] that's why when you were in this world
[2:09:14] when you were drinking and smoking they
[2:09:17] therefore didn't know who you are
[2:09:19] [Applause]
[2:09:23] he's gonna have you for eternity God was
[2:09:28] laughing but one day you heard the ego
[2:09:30] cry
[2:09:32] you heard the message of the hour the
[2:09:35] message of the hour revealed to you who
[2:09:37] you are
[2:09:38] [Music]
[2:09:41] the devil don't know what to do
[2:09:43] it is too late
[2:09:46] [Applause]
[2:09:51] now do you know who you are you became a
[2:09:54] machine of Destruction
[2:09:56] you become the one that is causing
[2:09:58] trouble to the devil you become a hot
[2:10:01] potato
[2:10:02] [Applause]
[2:10:02] [Music]
[2:10:06] [Applause]
[2:10:11] some of us our mother were not message
[2:10:14] believers
[2:10:15] Our Father were not message believers
[2:10:18] they were drunker they were catholic but
[2:10:21] despite that time God was watching you
[2:10:25] God was overshadowing you
[2:10:28] [Applause]
[2:10:32] they can shoot anybody but not you you
[2:10:35] always come out from a car accident and
[2:10:39] you don't die because God had a purpose
[2:10:42] [Music]

[2:10:50] greatest seal of the Bible

[2:11:37] save that baby and that baby is
[2:11:40] preaching to you today
[2:11:44] [Applause]
[2:11:50] chapter he was God who was watching me
[2:11:54] [Applause]
[2:11:59] hello okay everybody okay everybody good
[2:12:02] oh my God the Lord help me so your life
[2:12:06] is a mystery and your mystery is still
[2:12:10] it is still in the back part of God
[2:12:14] [Music]
[2:12:16] it is sealed deep in a well
[2:12:20] it's in the world but it's not on the
[2:12:23] surface it is deep we need to drown we
[2:12:27] need something to draw our mystery up
[2:12:33] [Applause]
[2:12:38] are we good are we okay
[2:12:43] my friend translating to John means
[2:12:47] that one okay
[2:12:51] the mystery of water his will and
[2:12:55] remember how we hang on that
[2:12:57] how many was here this morning let's see
[2:13:00] how we stuck on that we stuck on what
[2:13:03] the mystery of his will now it is not
[2:13:06] just a little thing
[2:13:09] then it's water a mystery God's will is
[2:13:13] water a mystery
[2:13:18] the will of God
[2:13:20] the will of God
[2:13:23] the will of God is a mystery in other
[2:13:26] words what God wants you to do
[2:13:29] is a mystery
[2:13:31] because the devil cannot touch it if we
[2:13:34] touch that brother Brahman said if he
[2:13:36] would have Hitler here what the 17th say
[2:13:38] he would have caused me great damage
[2:13:42] God only give a little bit
[2:13:45] and the devil think he got everything
[2:13:47] but he doesn't know that he can heed
[2:13:50] Moses and prepare him to come and
[2:13:51] destroy pharaoh
[2:13:55] he said God's will is water a mystery
[2:13:58] and each man
[2:14:00] has to do what seek out the will of God
[2:14:04] for water yes or herself God's Water
[2:14:08] mystery
[2:14:10] so you need to know what does God want
[2:14:13] you to do
[2:14:15] but that mystery is in the Deep
[2:14:20] we need to search for a tool that can
[2:14:23] pull that information for us because
[2:14:26] when Moses understood that information
[2:14:28] it was a different Moses
[2:14:32] he was not the Moses that ran away from
[2:14:34] Egypt Egypt he was the Moses that was
[2:14:37] going towards Egypt not with a sword
[2:14:40] with a stick
[2:14:43] not the strong Moses
[2:14:48] but with God on the inside
[2:14:52] [Applause]
[2:14:55] and Moses that doesn't use muscles
[2:14:59] but every Moses that use the word
[2:15:02] he just came he said Pharaoh
[2:15:05] let my people like it his people he
[2:15:10] become God
[2:15:11] oh my God
[2:15:17] [Music]
[2:15:19] God Moses I'm making you God
[2:15:24] and he because you're a God I'm gonna
[2:15:26] give you a prophet your brother Aaron
[2:15:28] that's your Prophet so when Moses said
[2:15:31] he doesn't say God said he said my
[2:15:33] people go
[2:15:39] he become the representative of God
[2:15:43] there's spokesman of God when you see
[2:15:46] Moses it is God
[2:15:49] speaking to Israel
[2:15:55] everybody okay
[2:15:58] how do we get to this let's go to Roman
[2:16:01] 8.
[2:16:02] I'm good in time it's just where we are
[2:16:04] it makes you feel like we are far away
[2:16:07] I'm still good in time so relax your
[2:16:09] body
[2:16:11] let's go Romans chapter eight if I can
[2:16:13] lay this down then I'm gonna climb
[2:16:15] quickly Romans chapter 8.
[2:16:18] if you dare you can say Amen
[2:16:21] Romans chapter 8
[2:16:23] verse 27
[2:16:25] we're talking about to you and faith
[2:16:30] 27 are you there amen listen to this
[2:16:34] and he that do what searches the heart
[2:16:37] knows what is the mind of the water the
[2:16:40] spirit
[2:16:41] we okay
[2:16:42] because he the spirit maketh makes
[2:16:46] intercession for the water the Saints
[2:16:48] according to the water will of God
[2:16:51] so who knows the will of God
[2:16:56] and because he knows the will of God he
[2:16:59] knows what to pray God for you
[2:17:03] the spirit knows how to pray for you
[2:17:07] that's why he said Peter I pray for you
[2:17:14] amen and his prayer work because Peter
[2:17:17] was not lost
[2:17:19] he didn't pray for Judah
[2:17:21] even though Judah was a disciple he only
[2:17:24] selected to pray for Peter
[2:17:29] he said be the second one to sift you
[2:17:33] but I won't let him do that
[2:17:35] because you were predestinated
[2:17:39] Judah he can take Judah Judah don't
[2:17:41] belong to me
[2:17:42] remember yesterday
[2:17:43] okay
[2:17:45] verse 28 and we know that what all
[2:17:48] things work water together for good to
[2:17:51] them that do what love God and to them
[2:17:53] that are called according to water his
[2:17:55] purpose
[2:17:56] so there is a purpose of God for you
[2:18:00] and everything that goes in your life is
[2:18:03] working according to the purpose of God
[2:18:05] for your life
[2:18:06] [Applause]
[2:18:07] everything that goes in your life God
[2:18:12] won't put something in your life that
[2:18:15] won't work according to what he's trying
[2:18:17] to achieve in your life
[2:18:19] whatever God wants to achieve in your
[2:18:21] life he already programmed
[2:18:24] in other words your trial has been
[2:18:27] evaluated
[2:18:33] that's what the Bible said he will never
[2:18:36] give you a trial greater than Who You
[2:18:38] Are
[2:18:39] if a trial is greater than you God say
[2:18:42] ah not him how is he going to fail this
[2:18:45] is too much for him give me the little
[2:18:47] one put it here not this one give me
[2:18:50] that one put it here give me this one
[2:18:53] put it here
[2:18:55] something is missing give me that one
[2:18:58] Gabriel give me that one give me that
[2:19:01] one

[2:19:11] you know what I made you if you know
[2:19:13] what I made you

[2:19:23] [Applause]

[2:19:27] yeah yeah
[2:19:29] [Music]

[2:19:37] why are you still alive
[2:19:39] why are you still laughing why are you

[2:20:21] Christian way ah so don't put it either
[2:20:24] way anyway ah

[2:20:30] did what foreign
[2:20:34] to the water image of his son you are
[2:20:37] programmed to become Jesus
[2:20:40] amen that he might be water the
[2:20:43] firstborn among water many Brethren now
[2:20:46] moreover whom he also did what
[2:20:48] predestining he also did water so in
[2:20:51] other words when the predestined
[2:20:53] epidemicinated when God lord
[2:20:55] predestination predestination is a combo
[2:20:59] he got salad he got tomato it's a combo
[2:21:03] predestinated he has called call have
[2:21:05] justification justification have what

[2:24:03] for after
[2:24:05] that in the wisdom of water God the
[2:24:09] World by the wisdom by wisdom knew not
[2:24:13] who God so there is two wisdom
[2:24:15] there is a wisdom of God and a wisdom of
[2:24:18] this world keep that in mind amen
[2:24:21] amen he pleased God by the foolishness
[2:24:26] everybody okay
[2:24:28] by the foolishness
[2:24:31] of preaching to do what save them to
[2:24:34] save them that do whatever believe
[2:24:36] everybody clear so far we clear so far
[2:24:39] job 2 verse 30.
[2:24:42] you there amen but of him are you aware
[2:24:46] in Christ Jesus who is of God who of God
[2:24:50] is made to us whatever wisdom so wisdom
[2:24:54] is who God is Christ
[2:24:58] the wisdom of God is Christ we clear
[2:25:01] we're clear now we clear that let's go
[2:25:05] to chapter two there we go we need to
[2:25:07] know how to draw
[2:25:08] you there let's follow this because
[2:25:11] sometimes message believer preacher
[2:25:13] preach this is a different route because
[2:25:15] they don't want to teach
[2:25:18] verse one and I Brethren when I came to
[2:25:22] you came not with Excellency of speech
[2:25:24] all of water wisdom which wisdom is Paul
[2:25:28] talking about of the world
[2:25:30] so we need to know when Paul is telling
[2:25:32] something
[2:25:34] don't just say oh the gospel is natural
[2:25:36] it's in power and demonstration hold on
[2:25:39] because your life is in a mystery
[2:25:41] remember your life is hidden a mystery
[2:25:44] watch Paul the wisdom declaring to you
[2:25:47] the testimony of who God for I
[2:25:49] determined not to know anything among
[2:25:51] you say who Jesus Christ and him have
[2:25:54] crucified watch verse four jump to verse
[2:25:56] four my friend you there and my speech
[2:25:59] and my preaching was not with
[2:26:01] interesting words of man's water wisdom
[2:26:05] not the wisdom of God the wisdom of man
[2:26:09] so Paul didn't preach the gospel with
[2:26:12] the wisdom of man of man
[2:26:16] but there is another wisdom which is the
[2:26:18] wisdom of God
[2:26:19] when Paul is preaching the gospel here
[2:26:22] he doesn't use the wisdom of God
[2:26:27] he's using the preaching
[2:26:29] but watch how what is he doing not the
[2:26:31] wisdom of man sorry amen not the wisdom
[2:26:35] of man amen but in the water in
[2:26:37] demonstration of the spirit and of water
[2:26:40] power that's your faith should not stand
[2:26:43] in the water wisdom of man not a wisdom
[2:26:46] of God but in the water power of God
[2:26:49] okay so when Akama preached to you I
[2:26:52] don't use the wisdom of man I use what
[2:26:55] what preaching of God and and the
[2:26:58] demonstration so your faith can be
[2:27:00] founded where in the demonstration and
[2:27:02] the power of God
[2:27:03] it looks like Paul is eliminating wisdom
[2:27:06] watch now the next verse verse 6 however
[2:27:13] you see that
[2:27:14] we speak water wisdom
[2:27:20] however I use a wisdom
[2:27:23] but not the wisdom of man so Paul was
[2:27:26] preaching with wisdom but the wisdom of
[2:27:29] God
[2:27:31] we okay now however
[2:27:34] we speak wisdom
[2:27:36] among them that are water perfect stop
[2:27:41] so the wisdom of God they don't give
[2:27:45] that to babies
[2:27:50] are we together
[2:27:52] Paul when he goes to evangelize
[2:27:56] amen he's using the power and the
[2:28:00] demonstration of the word
[2:28:02] Jesus Christ love you Jesus Christ saved
[2:28:04] you Jesus come to die for you you need
[2:28:07] the healing in your body that is the
[2:28:09] preaching of the Gospel
[2:28:11] that is Paul is trying to catch somebody
[2:28:14] and try to bring him to Christ that one
[2:28:17] Paul won't use the wisdom he keep it
[2:28:20] everybody good but when Paul catches you
[2:28:25] and baptize you and you woke up from the
[2:28:28] baptism and they lay hand on you and you
[2:28:31] receive the Holy Spirit you don't need
[2:28:33] salvation anymore
[2:28:34] now Paul say now come
[2:28:37] I need to switch the diet
[2:28:40] you don't need milk anymore
[2:28:43] [Applause]
[2:28:44] amen
[2:28:45] you are called for a purpose you need to
[2:28:48] know why God bought you here now the
[2:28:51] wisdom is coming
[2:28:53] we okay now we okay now and that wisdom
[2:28:56] they don't give it to baby they give
[2:28:58] them to those that are mature what is in
[2:29:01] that wisdom
[2:29:03] verse 6 amen however we speak wisdom
[2:29:07] among them that are hard perfect yet not
[2:29:10] the wisdom of this world nor of water
[2:29:13] the princes of this world that come to
[2:29:15] water not but we speak what the wisdom
[2:29:19] of God in the water a mystery
[2:29:24] everybody okay
[2:29:25] even the water hidden wisdom which God
[2:29:29] ordained before the world to our Glory
[2:29:32] so that wisdom is For Your Glory
[2:29:36] amen
[2:29:37] we need to know the program of life we
[2:29:40] need to know how to draw
[2:29:42] how do you draw now I know that God has
[2:29:46] something for me for my glory
[2:29:48] how do I get it Paul said when I send it
[2:29:51] to you I send it to you in in a mystery
[2:29:55] now how do you understand the mystery
[2:29:58] can I continue amen verse 8 which none
[2:30:03] of the princes of this world know
[2:30:07] had they know it
[2:30:09] there will not have water crucified
[2:30:13] the Lord of Glory
[2:30:15] are we okay now it's the people that
[2:30:19] crucify Jesus ever understood that
[2:30:22] mystery ever understood the backpacked
[2:30:26] mind of God
[2:30:27] they thought Jesus was troubling them
[2:30:29] they didn't know the backpack man of God
[2:30:32] the back part of God was Jesus would
[2:30:35] save you
[2:30:37] in order for Jesus to save you they must
[2:30:39] kill him the one Killing Jesus that's a
[2:30:42] heaven idea of you
[2:30:46] the devil knew that Killing Jesus Christ
[2:30:49] will produce so many believers and open
[2:30:52] the seventh seal the devil would have
[2:30:55] left it alone like leave Jesus alone
[2:31:01] Jesus said it is good for me God in
[2:31:06] other word if the devil heard that he
[2:31:09] should have Keep Jesus down because if
[2:31:11] Jesus don't go the Holy Ghost don't come
[2:31:13] but the devil had down by his
[2:31:18] even though he's hearing the word
[2:31:24] he's still doing what they would say
[2:31:28] [Applause]
[2:31:30] by Killing Jesus Christ he opened the
[2:31:33] door to the Holy Ghost now the Holy
[2:31:35] Ghost have to come God can enter into
[2:31:38] you if God if you don't want these
[2:31:41] people to become God lock Jesus alive
[2:31:43] keep him in love even if Jesus come and
[2:31:46] say kill me you should leave him alone
[2:31:48] the devil was searching to kill Jesus
[2:31:50] Christ
[2:31:52] Killing Jesus Christ it's an advantage
[2:31:54] to us that's what the scripture say if
[2:31:57] they knew
[2:31:58] that's what they're trying to do will

[2:41:36] the Bible says yeah the Water Deep
[2:41:40] things of God it's the spirit that can

[2:41:47] how can you draw we need something that
[2:41:49] can go in the deep and pull the Deep
[2:41:52] things that God have for us I'm gonna
[2:41:54] finish for what man knows the water
[2:41:57] things of man save the water spirit of
[2:42:00] man which is where in him in other words

[2:43:43] they say who will give you a call back
[2:43:45] they don't receive the job why yours

[2:43:49] it's a free gift
[2:43:51] he was already paid for
[2:43:53] and it's predestinated for you
[2:43:56] let me wonder my friend and then we go
[2:43:59] remember
[2:44:01] the former things of old for I am who
[2:44:04] God and there is water no one else
[2:44:08] I am who God and there is water none
[2:44:11] like me how is this God
[2:44:13] that says that there is nobody like him
[2:44:15] we want to know how he is that he can be
[2:44:18] so special
[2:44:20] because he say I am God and like me
[2:44:23] nobody in other words I'm special
[2:44:26] in other words I am unique what makes
[2:44:30] you unique
[2:44:31] please put your seatbelt because I'm
[2:44:34] gonna head straight to the airport okay
[2:44:36] what is this God that he says that me
[2:44:40] for you I'm special
[2:44:43] you see me in your life there is nobody
[2:44:46] that can be compared to me
[2:44:48] you can search all
[2:44:50] all eternity there is none
[2:44:54] like me for your life why who what makes
[2:44:58] you special God
[2:45:00] we need to ask him a question what makes
[2:45:02] you special that you God are saying
[2:45:04] today that there is no one like you I
[2:45:07] want to know what makes you special for
[2:45:09] me
[2:45:10] why should I consider you special
[2:45:13] you want to know let's investigate then
[2:45:15] we go home
[2:45:17] declaring water the air from the water
[2:45:20] beginning
[2:45:24] and from water ancient time the things
[2:45:27] that are not yet done
[2:45:30] saying water my counsel shall stand and
[2:45:33] I will do all my water pleasure push the
[2:45:36] brake
[2:45:37] this God say that he's special
[2:45:40] he's special there is nobody like you
[2:45:43] what makes him special is that he
[2:45:47] declare the end
[2:45:50] from the beginning
[2:45:53] what does it mean
[2:45:56] in other words
[2:45:58] God when he starts something
[2:46:02] it means it's already finished
[2:46:04] [Applause]
[2:46:05] [Music]
[2:46:09] God never starts something he have not
[2:46:13] finished
[2:46:16] when God begins something he always
[2:46:19] begins something when he's finished
[2:46:25] I don't know if you're getting me
[2:46:27] in other words before God starts you
[2:46:33] God make sure he finish you
[2:46:37] he sees your end
[2:46:39] [Music]
[2:46:42] I don't know if you get me
[2:46:44] so when God begin you
[2:46:47] amen it means you already finished
[2:46:53] his specialty is you are already
[2:46:56] finished
[2:46:57] he has things about you that he already
[2:47:00] spoke about you
[2:47:02] before you even start
[2:47:06] everybody okay
[2:47:08] and the Bible say his cancer will stand
[2:47:12] [Applause]
[2:47:13] [Music]
[2:47:15] in other words what God planned for you
[2:47:20] will happen no matter what
[2:47:25] [Applause]
[2:47:27] and if and if God has not started yet it
[2:47:33] means he is now he's still working
[2:47:37] the day he will finish
[2:47:40] that's when he started
[2:47:43] so the starting of God in your life it
[2:47:47] means that he's not stabbing
[2:47:52] God is actually
[2:47:55] storing what he already finished
[2:48:04] somebody's full he's not getting it
[2:48:08] somebody's full he has not finishing
[2:48:10] when the architecture Joe
[2:48:13] something to build amen the architect
[2:48:16] one built if he didn't finish the job
[2:48:19] [Applause]
[2:48:21] he finishes the drawing he get the cost
[2:48:24] and everything and they gave him a
[2:48:27] permit when they give I architect the
[2:48:30] permit it means that your plan is
[2:48:32] approved
[2:48:34] and your plan is already finished what
[2:48:37] follow is only an implementation of
[2:48:41] Japan
[2:48:42] they won't change anything anymore
[2:48:44] [Music]
[2:48:48] amen
[2:48:51] Lord help me
[2:48:57] let me say this amen let me say this do
[2:49:01] you know how you were conceived
[2:49:04] do you know how you were born
[2:49:06] do you know that before you are who you
[2:49:08] are do you know that you went through a
[2:49:10] fight
[2:49:11] [Applause]
[2:49:18] do you know that you went through a
[2:49:20] fight
[2:49:21] do you know how many people fought
[2:49:23] against you
[2:49:25] not one person
[2:49:28] a million
[2:49:29] [Applause]
[2:49:32] yes sir
[2:49:35] brother Brandon preached a message one
[2:49:37] amen
[2:49:39] brother Branham said when the sperm
[2:49:41] comes from a male it is a Millions film
[2:49:45] that million was you
[2:49:47] so when you are from your birth you were
[2:49:50] fighting
[2:49:53] [Applause]
[2:49:59] sometimes you are even behind
[2:50:03] but for some reason you keep jumping
[2:50:06] jumping jumping jumping
[2:50:11] until you find the egg and you're not
[2:50:14] dead and all the brothers
[2:50:18] and the sisters that were fighting with
[2:50:21] you they all die
[2:50:23] so by best you are a winner
[2:50:33] if you exist today because you want a
[2:50:37] battle
[2:50:38] by birth you are a winner
[2:50:40] if you didn't win you won't exist
[2:50:44] so I'm talking to women
[2:50:47] these are winners
[2:50:49] you already a witness
[2:50:52] you won
[2:50:54] why did you want because your brother
[2:50:57] was already finished
[2:50:58] [Music]
[2:50:59] [Applause]
[2:51:02] let's stop here let's stand let's stop
[2:51:05] here we will pick it up let's stop here
[2:51:08] [Applause]
[2:51:11] [Music]
[2:51:17] if I push too hard we're gonna launch in
[2:51:19] the Deep again
[2:51:21] if I push too hard
[2:51:23] if you are a human being today is
[2:51:26] because you want a battle
[2:51:28] [Music]
[2:51:33] so what makes that you want and
[2:51:36] everybody else didn't want
[2:51:39] who gave you the strength to bypass
[2:51:42] everybody
[2:51:43] [Music]
[2:51:48] do you see how much power you have
[2:51:51] that's why you heard David say even if
[2:51:55] an army
[2:51:57] Compass me around
[2:51:59] I will be therefore
[2:52:01] confident
[2:52:04] in other words the multitude is not my
[2:52:06] problem because before I come to this
[2:52:08] world I beat the multitude
[2:52:10] [Applause]
[2:52:16] I beat all of them that's why I'm here
[2:52:21] so I'm already a winner
[2:52:23] so I'm entering this word as a winner as
[2:52:27] a champion
[2:52:31] how did you win the battle
[2:52:34] you didn't have muscle
[2:52:37] you didn't have the intelligence how did
[2:52:39] you win that battle
[2:52:41] who helped you bypass everybody
[2:52:44] who was directing because somebody can't
[2:52:48] sell about you was already finished
[2:52:51] somebody already purposed something for
[2:52:54] your heart and what he said will happen
[2:53:01] there is more deeper stuff following
[2:53:03] this but let me hold off for next time
[2:53:06] we will pick up from here
[2:53:08] you are special
[2:53:11] you're not just anybody
[2:53:14] it doesn't matter how you were born
[2:53:17] I can prove to you I have quote I mean
[2:53:19] and and and what scripture to prove it
[2:53:21] to you amen the pro the way you came in

[2:53:33] why they didn't remove yours
[2:53:38] sometimes your mother suffer a lot
[2:53:42] but finally you came out

[2:53:47] God has a plan for your life and those
[2:53:50] plan are good plan
[2:53:52] that's what I was trying to get to with
[2:53:54] those plans are good plan the only one
[2:53:57] who knows that plan who can get deep and
[2:53:59] pull it up it's the spirit of the Lord
[2:54:02] a spirit to draw that's why the Holy
[2:54:04] Ghost is
[2:54:05] you you can I cannot offer emphasize the
[2:54:10] need of the Holy Ghost for for the

[2:54:43] you have freely died
[2:54:47] so that we can receive freely all things
[2:54:52] and you knew
[2:54:54] that it's impossible for us to go into
[2:54:57] your mind
[2:54:59] to search the Deep things that are in
[2:55:01] you
[2:55:02] but Lord you send your spirit

[2:56:00] not profit us
[2:56:02] all of that because we were under the
[2:56:05] influence
[2:56:06] following one another
[2:56:08] copying one another
[2:56:10] not knowing the plan and their purpose
[2:56:14] and the project that you have for us
