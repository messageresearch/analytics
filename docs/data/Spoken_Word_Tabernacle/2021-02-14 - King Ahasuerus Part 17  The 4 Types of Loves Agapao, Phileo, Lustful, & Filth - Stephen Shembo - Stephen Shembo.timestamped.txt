[20:48] testimony here uh
[20:49] for the glory of the lord um as the
[20:52] church knows i
[20:53] was diagnosed with latent tv
[20:56] and um they did the test of the test you
[20:59] know it kept on
[21:02] coming back negative but there was one
[21:03] major test that i was waiting on
[21:05] it's called the uh cultural results
[21:08] that takes like eight weeks so when i've
[21:11] been back i was still
[21:12] waiting on those results to come back
[21:14] and
[21:15] i think almost two weeks ago they called
[21:17] me up
[21:18] to just check up on me and everything
[21:20] else and um
[21:22] the results came back and it came back
[21:24] again negative
[21:26] and i just want to thank the lord for
[21:28] that i know
[21:30] the dev was not giving up uh but god is
[21:34] not giving up either
[21:35] so and i'm not giving up either so um
[21:38] i'm just thankful for the law because if
[21:41] it
[21:41] came back positive just a lot of
[21:44] headache
[21:45] so i'm just thankful that god is still
[21:47] god you know even
[21:48] even you know with the with the
[21:50] preaching that's coming forward god is
[21:52] i believe you know it's coming straight
[21:54] from the tone of god because it's a time
[21:56] where i
[21:56] i believe god is making that separation
[21:59] you know that you're either in or you're
[22:01] out and if you're in
[22:03] you know 100 you know it's not 50
[22:05] percent you know 100
[22:06] so i'm thankful for the word that's
[22:07] coming forth and
[22:09] um it's it's time for us to get out of
[22:12] here you know i'm just
[22:13] thankful to to god about that you know
[22:16] so i and i appreciate all the prayers

[44:57] trustees about everything that was given
[45:00] in the church report for tithing report
[45:04] for
[45:04] offering report for building fund
[45:07] we spoke to you last sunday that for

[45:12] laboring more on the building fund but
[45:14] what we had
[45:15] since last year is very little it is
[45:18] less than even five thousand dollars
[45:21] in a building fund when we purchase the
[45:23] church
[45:24] cash and the property cash whatever we
[45:27] have depleted
[45:29] significantly and we got work to do and
[45:31] we need to do some work
[45:33] so i have to tell you about looking and
[45:36] screaming
[45:37] screening onto the report from the
[45:41] trustee
[45:42] some of you are not paying your tax
[45:46] and as a pastor i don't want to wait for
[45:49] minister coming from outside
[45:51] to come and preach about that
[45:54] can you say amen i'm responsible to make
[45:58] sure you are in correct order
[46:02] and you can make it to heaven if i see
[46:05] something wrong in your life
[46:06] i'm not going to compromise with the
[46:08] world
[46:10] i'm going to lay the word as pure as i
[46:13] can
[46:14] to make sure when i faced my maker i
[46:17] don't have anybody's blood
[46:19] in my hand the bible says that if a
[46:21] watchman sees a danger
[46:24] that is coming up from somewhere if he
[46:27] does not
[46:28] warn the city if the people get killed
[46:32] if you need that scripture you see me
[46:34] the blood will be upon the watchmen but
[46:37] if the watchman sees a danger and he
[46:40] warned the people of the city
[46:42] and the people don't take heed to the
[46:44] watchmen
[46:45] the blood is not going to be on me and
[46:47] the blood is going to be on you
[46:50] you say brother stephen you begin to
[46:52] talk about turning
[46:53] brother branham said turning is god's
[46:55] money
[46:57] can you say amen i gave you the
[46:59] scripture brother branham said that he
[47:01] belonged to the pastor
[47:02] can you say amen never told you that if
[47:06] your pastor
[47:08] is a rich man you're not supposed to
[47:10] take time
[47:12] you don't pay tad because the pastor is
[47:14] a poor pastor
[47:16] you don't pay tad because the pastor is
[47:18] a dentist like your partner
[47:21] you pay that because the word of god
[47:23] said
[47:24] you need to pay time
[47:30] amen whether your pastor is a
[47:33] millionaire
[47:34] or not you need to pay your taxes
[47:39] amen and as your pastor i'm gonna make
[47:42] sure
[47:43] at least i speak to you if i
[47:46] uh bastard your bubble it's gonna do you
[47:49] good

[47:52] worship god with our thought
[47:54] with our being with our life with our
[47:57] offering
[47:58] with everything we must be lined up with
[48:00] the word of god
[48:02] if you struggle with turning and you
[48:05] don't know what timing mean
[48:07] if you want to see scripture you see me
[48:10] tithing means
[48:11] that you need to give the 10th unto the
[48:14] lord
[48:16] i'm going to take my time amen if your
[48:20] earning
[48:21] is five hundred dollars
[48:24] if you are sleeping you need to wake up
[48:28] if your earning is five hundred dollars
[48:32] this is what you get from your paycheck

[48:37] do this so you don't have no excuse

[49:06] ten percent of five hundred dollars is

[52:22] an offering so that the people can get
[52:24] blessed
[52:25] i say brother branham used to refuse it
[52:28] and brother branham came back he said
[52:30] what he was doing
[52:31] he was robbing the blessings of god from
[52:34] the people
[52:35] so he was supposed to get the offering
[52:38] and so that the people can get blessed
[52:41] because of
[52:42] that scripture because of that cult
[52:45] because of the word i took that offering
[52:49] from the trustees but you're tiring i
[52:51] have never touched your tithing
[52:53] up to today everybody clear so when i'm

[1:25:57] god bless you good to see you this
[1:25:58] morning we are continuing with king a
[1:26:01] hazardous feast
[1:26:02] uh three fists and esther's to banquet
[1:26:05] everybody clear we're on part 17.
[1:26:09] we already talked to you about the three
[1:26:11] feasts of king ahazaris
[1:26:13] we talk to you about the first banquet
[1:26:15] of east of uh
[1:26:16] esther which as we are progressing with
[1:26:19] what we are teaching
[1:26:20] you can begin to see what is coming up
[1:26:23] on the second banquet everybody clear
[1:26:26] now from where we left on wednesday
[1:26:29] we spoke that david was expressing
[1:26:32] to christ he expressed the cry
[1:26:35] that he wants his soul to be delivered
[1:26:38] which is so
[1:26:39] speak about the inward or the inside man
[1:26:42] and david also explained that he want
[1:26:45] also his body
[1:26:46] to be delivered and we found paul in
[1:26:49] romans chapter 7
[1:26:51] expressed the same thing that in my body
[1:26:53] i found another law
[1:26:55] and that law is sin and paul say oh
[1:26:58] wretched that i am
[1:26:59] who shall deliver me from this body
[1:27:02] everybody clear
[1:27:03] and then we found on wednesday that for
[1:27:05] the redemption of the soul
[1:27:07] god give us a grace and that grace
[1:27:11] brings
[1:27:11] faith in our heart and that faith cleans
[1:27:14] the inside man amen
[1:27:16] but when we look at peter peter
[1:27:19] explained to us that
[1:27:20] you need to continue in this faith and
[1:27:23] wait for another grace a second grace
[1:27:26] which is the grace that will come at the
[1:27:29] end
[1:27:29] at the revelation of jesus christ
[1:27:32] everybody clear
[1:27:33] and we explain to you that the capstone
[1:27:36] as he was coming down
[1:27:38] he didn't cry grace but the capstone was
[1:27:41] crying
[1:27:41] grace grace double grace in other words
[1:27:44] the message
[1:27:45] that we receive have a grace to save
[1:27:48] your soul and the message also also
[1:27:51] agrees
[1:27:52] to change your body everybody clear
[1:27:55] no problem so we get into the
[1:27:58] indian chief tap which explained that
[1:28:02] once he got saved he had a black dog and
[1:28:05] a white dog
[1:28:06] fighting and brother branham explained
[1:28:08] to us that the white dog was the holy
[1:28:10] ghost
[1:28:11] in tap and the black dog is seen
[1:28:14] that paul says that it was in the body
[1:28:17] everybody clear so from that we had
[1:28:20] three scenarios
[1:28:21] the first one you are born in sin
[1:28:24] shape and iniquity on the inside of you
[1:28:27] you have a black dog
[1:28:29] on the outside you have a black dog you
[1:28:32] are living
[1:28:33] like a hidden you are living like a
[1:28:36] sinner
[1:28:36] even if you are born from parents that
[1:28:39] have the holy ghost
[1:28:40] even if you are born in the message on
[1:28:44] the inside of you
[1:28:45] black dog on the outside black dog
[1:28:48] because you are born in sin that birth
[1:28:51] of
[1:28:52] sin and iniquity is speaking about a
[1:28:55] birth by sex
[1:28:56] he took a sex act to conceive you that's
[1:29:00] the reason why
[1:29:01] you are born with a perverted nature
[1:29:04] anybody clear so far
[1:29:06] then david spoke to us that god
[1:29:08] preferred that the inside man
[1:29:11] should receive his word so we told you
[1:29:14] that
[1:29:15] when we began when we became christian
[1:29:18] on where or
[1:29:19] when we are born again you're outside
[1:29:22] according to romans 7
[1:29:24] remain with a black dog ever clear
[1:29:27] that's why
[1:29:27] you are tempted because you are still in
[1:29:30] the body
[1:29:31] that's why you are forced into doing
[1:29:33] certain things
[1:29:34] because you are still in the body that's
[1:29:36] why you are growing
[1:29:38] that's why you get wrinkled that's why
[1:29:40] you get gray hair
[1:29:42] normally you should stop at a certain
[1:29:44] edge and never grow up again
[1:29:47] but the reason why we are growing up
[1:29:48] because death
[1:29:50] is in the body and death has been
[1:29:52] working
[1:29:53] trying to destroy the body everybody's
[1:29:55] saying well understand me
[1:29:56] whether you go to the hospital tomorrow
[1:29:58] you get sick they pray for you tomorrow
[1:30:00] you get sick because you are fighting
[1:30:02] with the black dog inside your body
[1:30:04] everybody clear
[1:30:06] so from moving from your birth to net
[1:30:09] new birth
[1:30:10] we explain to you that the holy ghost
[1:30:12] come with the word of god
[1:30:14] and the holy ghost claimed the inside
[1:30:16] man and the holy ghost
[1:30:18] enter and then see you there everybody
[1:30:20] clear
[1:30:21] now on the inside you are pure
[1:30:24] but your outside is still unclean now
[1:30:27] the
[1:30:27] white dog get on inside and
[1:30:30] automatically
[1:30:31] you begin to fight with the black dog
[1:30:33] that's why when israel drank the water
[1:30:36] from resident the next thing that
[1:30:38] followed the amalekite attack
[1:30:40] because somebody received the holy ghost
[1:30:43] ever clear
[1:30:44] brother branham in question answered he
[1:30:48] said dear brother branham
[1:30:49] will all the sons and daughters of true
[1:30:53] born again believer be saved brother
[1:30:56] branham said no
[1:30:58] brother no the sure won't
[1:31:02] as a copy david do places on this remark
[1:31:05] god don't have water
[1:31:09] grandchildren just water sons and
[1:31:12] daughters in other words if you are
[1:31:14] born in the message you still
[1:31:17] must be born again you must have
[1:31:20] your own personal experience with god
[1:31:23] not the experience of your mother not
[1:31:26] the experience of your father
[1:31:28] not the experience of your pastor but
[1:31:30] your own personal relationship
[1:31:33] between you and jesus christ can you say
[1:31:35] amen
[1:31:38] they shall have to be born just exactly
[1:31:42] like their father
[1:31:43] and mother was born of the spirit see
[1:31:46] that's what makes make a new man make a
[1:31:50] man
[1:31:50] a new person is because he's what
[1:31:53] born again he is reborn like jesus
[1:31:57] taught nicodemus
[1:31:58] you must be what born again he could
[1:32:00] never say wait a minute should i go to
[1:32:02] my mother's womb again
[1:32:03] and then come back and he said no no no
[1:32:05] you got to be born of water
[1:32:06] and of spirit water which is the word
[1:32:08] everybody clear
[1:32:10] now his first birth bring him a natural
[1:32:14] man on earth
[1:32:14] which is shepherd iniquity his second
[1:32:18] birth which is the new birth
[1:32:20] bring him a what spiritual man of heaven
[1:32:22] see
[1:32:23] he changed him he's what
[1:32:26] not his what so brother branham is
[1:32:29] telling you that when you get
[1:32:31] born again your soul changes but not
[1:32:35] your outside not your body anybody clear
[1:32:38] his of being he senses he still feel
[1:32:42] and smell and taste and here but he's
[1:32:45] what
[1:32:47] where david spoke if you tired you can
[1:32:49] stand back there i won't mind it
[1:32:51] he's in his inward part his desire
[1:32:55] what motivated him has been what
[1:32:58] changed to god so if your desires
[1:33:01] are still the same it means you are not
[1:33:04] born again
[1:33:06] because paul said that the worshiper
[1:33:08] once purged
[1:33:10] has no more what desire for
[1:33:13] sin everybody clear praise the name of
[1:33:16] the lord
[1:33:16] so the black dog staying in your body
[1:33:19] have a mission
[1:33:21] his mission is to pull you back to where
[1:33:24] you came from
[1:33:25] and the white dog coming into your life
[1:33:28] is coming also with a mission or an
[1:33:31] agenda
[1:33:32] and his agenda is to push you forward
[1:33:35] towards redemption so one is pushing you
[1:33:39] back to egypt
[1:33:40] one is pushing you to the promised land
[1:33:43] and you are
[1:33:44] caught in between two opinion everybody
[1:33:47] clear so far
[1:33:48] brother branham we grow up
[1:33:51] each day our heart anger hunger
[1:33:55] keep moving on there is something
[1:33:57] growing water
[1:33:59] we explain to you that when the holy
[1:34:01] ghost gets into you
[1:34:03] when you are born again the holy ghost
[1:34:06] will come
[1:34:07] you are 100 50 here black
[1:34:10] 50 here black completely 100
[1:34:14] black 50 here 50 here when you are born
[1:34:17] again
[1:34:18] your 50 percent here becomes white
[1:34:21] everybody clear but you have another 50
[1:34:24] of you that is still black and as the
[1:34:27] white dog which is the holy ghost coming
[1:34:30] to you
[1:34:30] the only gods will begin to grow you
[1:34:33] need to feed him with the word
[1:34:35] as he grows he begins to push the white
[1:34:38] of the black dog
[1:34:39] away that's why paul said we die what
[1:34:43] daily the more you die the more the holy
[1:34:46] ghost
[1:34:46] is getting grown into your life
[1:34:50] brother branham continue there is
[1:34:52] something going inside of you the white
[1:34:54] dog amen
[1:34:55] you get bigger he spread out paul
[1:34:59] said told the corinthian church you are
[1:35:02] maturing
[1:35:03] growing but when you ought to be
[1:35:05] teachers
[1:35:06] you are still what babes needing
[1:35:08] teaching
[1:35:09] is that right when you ought to be what
[1:35:12] teacher
[1:35:12] paul is telling the christian of
[1:35:14] corinthians that you already have been
[1:35:16] born again
[1:35:17] i'm expecting when i come a year or two
[1:35:20] years later
[1:35:22] i want to see you on the inside 70
[1:35:24] percent
[1:35:25] i want to see some of you ready percent
[1:35:28] i want to see some of you
[1:35:29] 60 but it seems like when i come back
[1:35:33] you don't grow something is wrong
[1:35:38] amen something in there
[1:35:41] growing out pushing out making bigger
[1:35:44] like i told you the stone of daniel the
[1:35:47] stone came
[1:35:48] struck the image destroyed the image but
[1:35:50] the stone
[1:35:51] never stopped there the stone began to
[1:35:53] grow until it filled the whole earth
[1:35:55] everybody clear
[1:35:57] he says something in there growing out
[1:36:00] pushing out making bigger the holy
[1:36:02] spirit
[1:36:03] doing what the white dog is growing
[1:36:06] everybody clear their new birth
[1:36:10] if a birth is born from the outside
[1:36:13] from the inside out do you see that
[1:36:17] the child he grows if he lives
[1:36:20] if he doesn't he remain is that right
[1:36:24] well when a birth is on the inside
[1:36:27] shouldn't it grow in other words when a
[1:36:29] child is born
[1:36:30] the baby does not remain baby the baby
[1:36:34] continued to grow
[1:36:35] everybody clear if somebody is sleeping
[1:36:37] beside you shake him a little bit
[1:36:39] everybody clear amen so when the baby
[1:36:42] grows if a baby grows
[1:36:44] if you are born again inside of you god
[1:36:48] also need to grow
[1:36:50] you cannot be born again and remain the
[1:36:52] same
[1:36:54] if your experience today is not
[1:36:56] different than your experience
[1:36:58] five years ago you need to check
[1:37:00] yourself
[1:37:01] you need to seek for god you must be
[1:37:03] able to look back
[1:37:05] and say that i'm not what i used to be
[1:37:08] i am not where i'm going because the
[1:37:10] white dog is pushing me
[1:37:12] but i know i am progressing somewhere
[1:37:14] everybody clear
[1:37:16] he said the christ in your heart or to
[1:37:20] be doing what
[1:37:22] growing what not monthly
[1:37:28] jesus christ in your heart need to grow
[1:37:31] every day hallelujah
[1:37:35] getting what more what
[1:37:39] our what
[1:37:43] amen as you grow your understanding with
[1:37:47] god
[1:37:47] increasing the power of god
[1:37:50] increases because the white dog
[1:37:53] is pushing the black dog outside
[1:37:57] ever clear praise the name of the lord
[1:38:00] growing bed getting
[1:38:02] bigger more powerful understanding
[1:38:05] things better
[1:38:06] how can you be five years you still have
[1:38:08] a problem understanding certain things
[1:38:11] amen you are five years in the message
[1:38:14] ten years in the message you don't know
[1:38:15] how to pay taxes
[1:38:18] amen you need to die to that today
[1:38:22] and let the white dog take over that
[1:38:24] territory
[1:38:26] everybody clear more powerful
[1:38:29] understanding things better forgiving
[1:38:32] working on god as god would till christ
[1:38:36] be forming you the hope of what
[1:38:39] so as we get born again we don't stop
[1:38:43] but every day we die and as we die
[1:38:46] christ is growing christ is growing
[1:38:48] until you reach a point then one of this
[1:38:50] day
[1:38:51] your entire body will be quickened
[1:38:53] together and you're gonna meet god
[1:38:55] into the air that won't be the time that
[1:38:57] the black dog won't be completely out
[1:39:00] and from the inside and the outside you
[1:39:03] are purely
[1:39:05] white dog everybody
[1:39:10] praise the name of the lord brother
[1:39:12] branham
[1:39:15] at the coming of who at the coming of
[1:39:19] the lord jesus
[1:39:20] this body is picked from the earth again
[1:39:24] and made in a water a glorified state to
[1:39:28] live in what
[1:39:30] so brother branham is telling us here
[1:39:33] when jesus christ come

[1:42:21] of a christian water that's why when the
[1:42:24] holy spirit
[1:42:26] gets into your life the holy ghost begin
[1:42:29] to grow
[1:42:30] that's why the bible says the spirit
[1:42:33] inside of you and the bread which you

[1:42:37] are saying come because when god comes
[1:42:42] he kicks the white the the black dog out
[1:42:44] of you
[1:42:45] and the black dog goes to its
[1:42:47] destination from hell
[1:42:49] and when they judge you they don't see
[1:42:51] any blackness in you
[1:42:53] amen when they look at you i thought
[1:42:57] yesterday you did something wrong
[1:42:59] where is it they can't find it because
[1:43:01] hell
[1:43:02] open and swallow everything that you did
[1:43:05] and you are completely
[1:43:07] free that is the stage we are going in
[1:43:10] everybody clear praise the name of the
[1:43:12] lord
[1:43:13] as we are dealing with the black dog
[1:43:16] let's go ahead and get in now
[1:43:20] in galatians 2 20 paul says that
[1:43:24] i am crucified with christ we identify
[1:43:27] on the sixth year
[1:43:28] at the cross nevertheless i live
[1:43:32] yet not who but who
[1:43:35] that lives with me in other words i am
[1:43:38] being crucified
[1:43:39] with christ on the inside man the one
[1:43:43] living inside of me
[1:43:44] is not me paul anymore it is christ
[1:43:47] jesus christ that is living on me under
[1:43:50] the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:43:52] everybody following me and the life
[1:43:55] which i now live

[1:44:04] by the water
[1:44:06] which is your victory the faith of the
[1:44:08] son of god
[1:44:09] who loved me your valentine and gave
[1:44:12] himself to what
[1:44:14] galatians 5 24 and they data
[1:44:18] christ belong to christ have crucified
[1:44:21] the word
[1:44:22] with the affection and what that's the
[1:44:25] reason why

[1:45:17] report corruption but
[1:45:20] he does so if to what the white dog
[1:45:23] shall of the spirit report so
[1:45:26] as you give the holy ghost the word of
[1:45:30] god and you feed the holy ghost in your

[1:45:33] the holy ghost will continue to gain
[1:45:35] more strength
[1:45:36] and push you all the way to redemption
[1:45:39] but
[1:45:40] as you begin to feed the black dog

[1:49:20] sanctified but you are justified
[1:49:23] in the name of the lord jesus and by the
[1:49:25] spirit of our god
[1:49:28] everybody clear all things are lawful to
[1:49:31] me
[1:49:32] but all things are not expedient they
[1:49:34] are not profitable
[1:49:36] all things are loveful to me but i will
[1:49:38] not be brought under the power of
[1:49:40] any meat for the belly and the belly for
[1:49:44] meat
[1:49:45] but god shall destroy both it and them
[1:49:48] now the body is not for what
[1:49:52] young people their body is not for you
[1:49:55] to have
[1:49:56] sex before marriage
[1:49:59] i'm gonna talk to you plan
[1:50:02] amen your democrats play too much
[1:50:06] with morality i'm not a republican i'm
[1:50:09] not a democrat
[1:50:10] but we're living on the democrat where
[1:50:13] they play with
[1:50:14] uncleanness anybody clear
[1:50:18] the body is not for fornication
[1:50:22] but for but for who and their lord for
[1:50:25] the word
[1:50:26] so this body that the black dog living
[1:50:30] is not for you to commit fornication
[1:50:35] i'm going and god has both raised up the
[1:50:39] lord
[1:50:40] and will also always raise us up by his
[1:50:43] own power we know roman 8 says that
[1:50:46] no you not that your what
[1:50:49] our what so your body not only
[1:50:52] is he a temple but your body
[1:50:56] is a body that god borrow to do certain
[1:50:59] things
[1:51:01] are you following me you are members of
[1:51:04] god
[1:51:05] shall i then take the members of christ
[1:51:08] and make them members of what prostitute
[1:51:12] god forbid what no you
[1:51:15] not that being which is joined to a
[1:51:19] harlot a prostitute
[1:51:20] is what you become one flesh
[1:51:24] for two for two say he
[1:51:27] shall be one flesh but he that is joined
[1:51:30] to the lord
[1:51:31] is one spirit verse 18 young people
[1:51:35] flee in other words run away
[1:51:39] free what every sin
[1:51:42] that a man does is outside of the world
[1:51:47] so when you cast somebody it is outside
[1:51:50] your body
[1:51:51] when you are lying it is outside your
[1:51:53] body
[1:51:54] but when you are committing fornication
[1:51:57] you actually are bringing uncleanness to
[1:52:00] your body
[1:52:02] i'm gonna talk to you plan
[1:52:07] are you there free fornication
[1:52:10] everything that man does is outside the
[1:52:13] body
[1:52:14] but he that commit fornication since
[1:52:17] again what
[1:52:19] so if you are here and you are having
[1:52:22] sexual relationship before you are
[1:52:25] married
[1:52:26] you are actually committing sin against
[1:52:29] your own body
[1:52:30] and against god do you follow me
[1:52:34] brother stephen i don't commit sinner i
[1:52:37] have not touched any woman
[1:52:39] what do you do with that pornography

[1:52:47] clear
[1:52:48] verse 19 what know you not that your
[1:52:51] body is what

[1:53:01] and you are not of your own for you are
[1:53:04] burnt
[1:53:04] with a work therefore do what

[1:53:12] which belongs to who paul is saying
[1:53:15] glorify god in your body
[1:53:18] and glorify god in your holy gospel

[1:56:00] when they're boiling more he gives you a

[1:56:42] in the message god hiding himself in
[1:56:44] simplicity
[1:56:46] brother branham say now getting in this
[1:56:49] now there might be chemists sitting here

[1:56:55] will be chemists
[1:56:56] listen at it i don't know the formula
[1:56:59] but i want
[1:57:00] just to explain it in my own humble way
[1:57:03] trusting that god will reveal himself in
[1:57:05] it
[1:57:06] but branham is taking an example of
[1:57:08] chemistry but he's trying to draw a
[1:57:10] message
[1:57:11] to make you understand something about
[1:57:14] god everybody clear

[1:57:44] are you there where did they come from
[1:57:47] cosmic light
[1:57:48] see you plumb back past finding of
[1:57:51] chemistry
[1:57:52] and if it's a substance it's a creation
[1:57:54] it comes from water
[1:57:56] so in other words it's a creator that
[1:57:59] creates a substance
[1:58:01] and that substance brings cosmic light
[1:58:03] cosmic lights bring
[1:58:04] election election being adam adams bring

[2:56:58] just want to find a point where we can
[2:57:00] stop
[2:57:01] so that they can at least leave the
[2:57:03] church having something
[2:57:04] that they can grasp on to chew
[2:57:07] throughout the week
[2:57:08] before we come back again and continue

[2:57:16] morning
[2:57:16] to your children some of them might
[2:57:19] think that it's heavy and probably they
