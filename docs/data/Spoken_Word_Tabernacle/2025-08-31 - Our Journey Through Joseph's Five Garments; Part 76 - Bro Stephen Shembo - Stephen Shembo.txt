eternal life. Is that right? And he gives it to you. But what? He that heareth my words and believeth on him that sent me has eternal life. That's without end. And shall never come to the judgment, but hath passed from death unto life. Now find you a good church home quickly. Be baptized and move into that church, you and your family, and live peacefully with God. And if I never meet you again this side of the river, I'll meet you on the other side. The Lord bless you. Maybe if we have time after the prayer cards are given and we're praying for the sick tonight that you'll you can come up around the altar and stand here a little while. so the pastors or the city can see who you are. I let a 50,000 converts go here not long ago. I don't know what happened in a certain nation that I was in. Someone just set up the meetings. We didn't have any cooperation. They just set up the meeting and thousands poured into that country and there was no church home to take them to. I don't know what happened. I thought every church in the country was cooperating, but just a minister or a man, just a lawyer just set up the meeting and said, "Come on." And I just flew in there and started. We had five nights and 5,000 each night or more come to Christ. And I don't know what happened where they went to church home. Uh learning a little better than that now. Every every person that's saved ought to have a church home. &gt;&gt; Amen. the ought to be in church and there every every time that church has a service or every time you pass it go in open the doors and go in and pray or do something love the Lord. It was a today where I live there was a some people that had to leave. There happened to be a very good Norwegian friend of mine who's sitting here is my secretary for the Norwegian people and has been since I was in Norway and he's done all the translation not one scent part or anything.

You know, these brothers, I had this I had my portion of the service planned. You know, I try to get a little inspiration through the week and let everybody know in advance, but everything that these brothers sang and talked about yesterday just kind of confirmed it. They mentioned the rock a few times in their songs, and I wanted to sing the rock of ages this morning. Amen. Cuz that's what he is. And sometimes, and I'm a hard head, but sometimes that rock can display itself through my wife. She, you know, and I and sometimes I beat my head against the rock, you know, headship and submission and, you know, but she speaks and it's the voice of God.

Lily has a praise report if get her miked up again. And &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I know we already know it's my parents anniversary, but I feel like I just need to say something about it. Um, being the youngest, I feel like, you know, you have a different perspective than your older siblings do. My older siblings kind of saw the beginning stages of my parents' marriage, but I saw like years and years later that I saw the wisdom that they grew in towards, you know, closer to now. And I got to reap more of the benefits of that. And you know, your older siblings say that the youngest is the most spoiled and the one where the one, you know, where your parents are more lenient, but I think my parents just grew in a lot of wisdom when they had me and um getting married. You rely a lot on your parents' wisdom. When you're getting started and my parents have really shared a lot of their wisdom of their early year struggles with us with no judgment. We've always been able to come and talk to them. Amen. &gt;&gt; And um being able to just sit and talk to your parents for hours and see like 37 years of of growth and 37 years of your family. Um it's really a blessing to me and Zach. So I just wanted to praise God that our family got started 37 years ago today. &gt;&gt; Brother Kelly, you want to say something? Can I say something first? We didn't get a chance yesterday. This brother here, you talk about an inspiration. I started thinking, Lord, I ain't done nothing. And what have I done for God compared to this man? You know, Brother Brandham used to say that, but after hearing everything that this brother's done, it's just amazing the life that he's had and what he's done in the kingdom. And I just want to say, you know, hopefully for spoken word that we love you with all our heart. We appreciate you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise. Praise the Lord. But John, congratulations. I'm not going to take anything away from uh your marriage, your year. Sister Edith, God richly bless you, your anniversary. But I just wanted to bring this testimony from yesterday. You know, one of some of the ones that were there, the the senior pastor that was there, he came to me probably, he says, "I've never witnessed nothing like this before." &gt;&gt; And we thank the Lord for Sister Lorel, Sister Pam, and I wanted to wait till they can hear it internationally. what God was doing. But he said it wasn't that that really struck his spirit. He said it was the people, the love that was in the people that was there yesterday. He said that's what he never seen like he never seen before. God bless you and thank you all. Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Isn't it wonderful to be a part of this? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, really? &gt;&gt; Caroline and brother Tony, &gt;&gt; it's your anniversary, brother Tony, today. You didn't forget, did you? &gt;&gt; Happy anniversary, brother. 36 years. Amen. It's today. Yesterday. Ah, wonderful. Wonderful. &gt;&gt; I I was really impressed yesterday with with the elders to look at some of those old soldiers. &gt;&gt; You could see battle scars. &gt;&gt; You could tell in their spirit that they had been through a lot. and and it was just wonderful because there's they're still here for us. Yes. The threefold cord, it can't be broken. And we just appreciate I had not seen brother Anderson. Brother Kelly, we were baptized in his church by another man in 1992. And brother Anderson had counseledled my wife and I with the presence of his wife and we had not seen them since that day in January of 1992. And it was such a joy to see them and brother Isaiah Brooks to see them just to just to enjoy the fellowship. We have brother Kelly's brother here today as well, brother Patrick from West Palm Beach. So we want to make sure that we greet him and make him feel welcome as well. And and and you feel you fill out a visitor card. But brother Kelly, you know we ain't got no visitors here. Amen. Amen.

Somebody's lost. &gt;&gt; Abraham Lincoln ship is the United States warship that they keep on the Pacific to keep everything. So once all those three are clear, we turn our Abraham Lincoln ship toward the fellowship hall and then begin to work and see how we can put the foundation and everything. Amen. &gt;&gt; What God is doing to this church, some of the testimony, I don't even know how to tell you because I'm on YouTube. &gt;&gt; So it's hard for me to tell you. I just need to keep quiet. If I I tell you, it's on YouTube. You just uh just let's just keep God is doing many things &gt;&gt; because this one will blow your mind but I can't tell it because I got the camera on me. Amen. &gt;&gt; Uh so &gt;&gt; I got two audience. I got the visible and the invisible. &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Glenn, what should I do? I can't tell it on the camera. I'm sorry the invisible audience. &gt;&gt; It's our season. &gt;&gt; You want to know? [Laughter] &gt;&gt; Brother Robert, do you agree? &gt;&gt; I'm sorry. I made a big mistake.

The Lord's willing. My theme this morning, if you need a title, my title is our life journey through Joseph's five garment part 76. It's a seven seal silence. Our team this morning, if the Lord give us time, is taking advantage. &gt;&gt; All right, &gt;&gt; there we go. of the seasons. &gt;&gt; You know very well if you start pulling that's your problem. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's pray. Heavenly Father, Lord, we are approaching you humbly this morning again. Father, thanking you for your grace, your love, your mercy, and for everything you have been doing for us. Father, this is as far as I can go with the ability you have given me. But when it comes to speaking, ministering to your children, the purchase of the blood of the lamb, he only take a supernatural action of the Holy Spirit. So, Father, may you come and move me completely out of the way. May you be the one talking, the one speak, speaking, the one ministering, and the one hearing and listening. Lord Father, may you come and bless us, Lord Father, in the power of your resurrection. We rebuke every demonic spirit away from this place.

Even if you don't you are sick yourself, &gt;&gt; you can still pray for somebody &gt;&gt; and God will heal that person. &gt;&gt; Jesus was on the cross &gt;&gt; but he could grant salvation to somebody &gt;&gt; but he could not remove himself from the cross &gt;&gt; because the cross has a different path for him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But he can still grieve salvation. He didn't say wait till I come off from the cross then I'm going to give you salvation. So whichever state you are in &gt;&gt; whether you going through the valley or you are on green man I mean pastor whatever just know God is with you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; 1 Chronicle 12:32. The Bible says this is the children of Issachar and the children of Isachar which were men of what? &gt;&gt; That had understanding of &gt;&gt; men that had understanding of time. The children of Issacha. Now you understand this very well. Those were men that have understanding of what? &gt;&gt; The times. &gt;&gt; Times in plural. &gt;&gt; Understanding of times. &gt;&gt; In other words, these people have a discernment. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Of times. In other word, of seasons. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; The children of Issachar have understanding of times. Come on. To know what Israel ought to do. So it's not just a discernment, just knowing &gt;&gt; but their revelation &gt;&gt; goes with the works. &gt;&gt; You may be seated. So they also know &gt;&gt; what to do. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The first one is a revelation which means faith and the second one is work. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. They know, they understand the time, &gt;&gt; but they don't stop at understanding the time. &gt;&gt; After understanding the time, they also get into action. &gt;&gt; So, it's faith with works &gt;&gt; because faith without work is dead. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The Bible says that to know what Israel ought to do. The heads of them were 200 and all their brethren were at their commandment. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; This was needed for the throne of David. Now let's go to the book of proverb chapter 6. &gt;&gt; If we cross the book of proverb, it will be wonderful. Sister Adansa, you can refocus again if you cross this book of proverb. It will be wonderful. So Lord, help me cross it. Amen. &gt;&gt; Proverb chapter 6. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Verse 6. If you dare, you can say amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know this, we dare. We We went into a detail. Now, I'm going to go ahead and maneuver differently. &gt;&gt; Verse six, the Bible says, "Go to the end." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, God is sending somebody to the end. Amen. &gt;&gt; This is grace. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; This is mercy. &gt;&gt; In other words, God have seen the suffering of someone. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And now God is bringing the solution. &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. &gt;&gt; And the solution is go to the end. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You who? &gt;&gt; Slugger. &gt;&gt; Slugger is a lazy man. All right. &gt;&gt; So today as we moving we will see what is wrong with a slugger. &gt;&gt; A lazy man. Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So God is extending his mercy. Amen. &gt;&gt; His grace. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Upon a lazy &gt;&gt; upon a slagger &gt;&gt; because God could have left that slagger like that. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And he can continue on his own ways in his own ways and continue to suffer. &gt;&gt; But God came down &gt;&gt; and say, "I see your condition." Amen. &gt;&gt; You are struggling. &gt;&gt; And I'm bringing you mercy. &gt;&gt; I'm bringing you a solution. &gt;&gt; And your solution is go to the end. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Keep your seat belt. I'm going to take off from the airport. Amen. &gt;&gt; He said go to the end, you slugger. Amen. &gt;&gt; He says, "Consider its way and do what?" &gt;&gt; Be wise. &gt;&gt; Consider its way and be wise. If you notice, God is sending a slugger. A slugger is a human being. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This slugger is a human being. &gt;&gt; Amen. But God doesn't send this human being to another human being. &gt;&gt; God is sending this human being to an end. &gt;&gt; Now look at the size that you are. &gt;&gt; Who is here who never seen an ant? &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Number one, God is showing mercy. &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord. God is showing grace. &gt;&gt; God is bringing deliverance. &gt;&gt; God is bringing solution &gt;&gt; to the problem that this man is struggling with. &gt;&gt; And the solution is in the house of an ant. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God cannot send you a big man like brother Steven. &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. A big man like you are, &gt;&gt; a big lady like you are, &gt;&gt; and God send you to the end. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There must be some type of a proud spirit. &gt;&gt; Help me leave the airport, my friend. &gt;&gt; I'm going through a surgery. Help me leave the airport, my friend. There must be a proud spirit &gt;&gt; in this slagger. &gt;&gt; He's a proud slagger. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And and in order for God to help him, &gt;&gt; God have to humble him. &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. &gt;&gt; This is my Bible different than yours. &gt;&gt; This slagger here is proud. Amen. &gt;&gt; So God say, "Since you proud, I'm going to send you to the end." &gt;&gt; In other words, I want you to gain wisdom, &gt;&gt; not from another human being, &gt;&gt; not from a preacher, &gt;&gt; not from a prophet, &gt;&gt; your wisdom will come from an ant. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. And the Bible says this about the ant. I'm still reading my Bible. So turn your 45 minute off. Amen. The Bible says about the ant in proverb 30:4. He says there be what? &gt;&gt; Four things. &gt;&gt; If you read this yourself at home, which I will also advise you to do, stay on uh chapter 6. These four things in if you go to the book of proverb, the four things are the first one is an end. We clear. &gt;&gt; The second one is a connie. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The third one was the locust. It's written in your Bible. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the fourth one was a spider. You can verify that in the book of Solomon. Solomon said there are four things. The first is an ant. The second is a connie. The third one is a locust. And the fourth one is a spatter. But out of all these four, &gt;&gt; the smallest one &gt;&gt; is the end. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the Bible says that these four creatures, these four things which are little upon the earth, but they are exceedingly what? &gt;&gt; Wise. &gt;&gt; So the spider according to the Bible is wise. Right. Right. &gt;&gt; If you doubt, you don't say, "Amen." We going to open Proverb 30. &gt;&gt; We're good. &gt;&gt; We good. &gt;&gt; According to the Bible, the spider is wise. &gt;&gt; The locust is wise. &gt;&gt; The conies are wise. &gt;&gt; The ant are wise. &gt;&gt; Exceedingly wise. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; But God didn't send this man to the locust. &gt;&gt; He didn't send him to the spider. He didn't send him to the conies. &gt;&gt; God sent him to the end to the smallest one &gt;&gt; because this guy have a problem of a proud spirit. &gt;&gt; I know you won't get me now, but you will get it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So God is humbling this man. &gt;&gt; God is humbling this woman. &gt;&gt; Say you got a problem, &gt;&gt; but your solution go to the right. &gt;&gt; Humble yourself. &gt;&gt; Amen. to the wisdom of an end. &gt;&gt; And we know that wisdom was God's wisdom. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But it was displayed in humility. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Proverbs 6 verse 7. Which have what? &gt;&gt; No guide. &gt;&gt; You already understand that. &gt;&gt; Overseer or what? &gt;&gt; Ruler. &gt;&gt; But the end provide her meat when &gt;&gt; in the summer. &gt;&gt; And gather her food when? &gt;&gt; In the harvest. So the ant is a creature that understand season. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The ant. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Understand understand time. Understand season. Amen. &gt;&gt; When it's summer, the ant knows what to do. And when it's fall, which is the harvest, the ant knows exactly what to do. And God say go learn from the end. &gt;&gt; And when you learn from the end, you find out that the end work with the season. &gt;&gt; The end take advantage. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Take opportunity. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Of the season. &gt;&gt; When it's the correct season, the ant is in action. &gt;&gt; The ant knows how to discern the time &gt;&gt; and walk in a time. &gt;&gt; Are we together? Because the children of Isachar, not only do they have understanding of time, but they know what to do. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; And the Bible says that the end provide her meat when &gt;&gt; in the summer. &gt;&gt; And gather her food where? &gt;&gt; In the harvest. &gt;&gt; In the in the harvest. He's gathering the food. In other words, somebody's storing the food. Keep that in mind, my friend. If you look on Proverb right here, the Bible says that the ant are a people not strong. So it's not about the physical strength. &gt;&gt; It's about wisdom &gt;&gt; and knowing what to do. Yet they prepare the meat when &gt;&gt; in the summer. &gt;&gt; And what are they preparing the meat for? &gt;&gt; For the future oncoming season which is called what? &gt;&gt; Winter. Keep that in mind. Lord help me. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Verse uh 8 uh verse 9. How long &gt;&gt; will you sleep who? &gt;&gt; Oh slugger. &gt;&gt; I'm going to read it again. God is saying &gt;&gt; how long &gt;&gt; will you sleep who? What? &gt;&gt; Slugger. &gt;&gt; So this man must be in this condition for a long time. &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. It's a man that God is bringing mercy, &gt;&gt; grace, deliverance, solution. It's a man that have been proud &gt;&gt; and has been in this condition. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; For a long time until he became a nature. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And they call him already slagger. &gt;&gt; He was not born slagger. But he became slagger. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The Bible say, "How long will you sleep or oh slugger? &gt;&gt; When will you arise out of your what?" &gt;&gt; Sleep. &gt;&gt; So God is wanting this man to wake up. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; God want this man to wake up or this woman wake up. In other words, you've been sleeping too long. &gt;&gt; So God is bringing an awakening. Amen. That's right. Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Verse 10. Why? &gt;&gt; Yet a little sleep. &gt;&gt; This is the behavior of the man. &gt;&gt; We went through this. Yet a what? &gt;&gt; A little sleep. &gt;&gt; Not a big one. You remember this? &gt;&gt; Yet what? &gt;&gt; A little sleep. &gt;&gt; Uh-huh. &gt;&gt; A little slumber. &gt;&gt; And a little folding of hand. In other words, doing nothing. &gt;&gt; Amen. So shall poverty come as one that travails and you and your want as a nman. In other words, poverty will hit you like a thief. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; So God is showing the behavior of this slagger right here that his behavior that have consequences of poverty is that this man is inactive. &gt;&gt; Amen. doing nothing, &gt;&gt; folding hand and as a consequence poverty and God is bringing the solution. Go to the house of the ant. And this is your solution. Everybody clear? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Everybody clear? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's go to Proverb 12 as we dealing with this slagger. &gt;&gt; If you dare, you can say amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Proverb 12 verse 27, a slagger, a lazy, a sloful man. It's the same word. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Don't worry, you'll be all right. &gt;&gt; Proverb 12 27. If you dare, you can say amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The slothful, which is the slagger, man roasteth not that which he took in hunting. In other words, this man will go to hunt &gt;&gt; and God will bless the man. &gt;&gt; Follow me my friend. &gt;&gt; And after God brought his blessing to the man, &gt;&gt; the man stop right there &gt;&gt; and does not complete the task. &gt;&gt; He does not utilize the resource &gt;&gt; that God brought unto him. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Number five, it's a man. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Who does not complete task [Laughter] does not complete task or a man. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. who waste &gt;&gt; resources &gt;&gt; provided by God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In other words, God will give him some blessing. &gt;&gt; He goes to hunting &gt;&gt; and he come back with a big paycheck. &gt;&gt; Amen. But he doesn't continue all the way. &gt;&gt; He gets stuck somewhere. &gt;&gt; And before you know it, &gt;&gt; they prey &gt;&gt; whatever he caught up from the hunting &gt;&gt; will be destroyed &gt;&gt; and spoiled &gt;&gt; because of his attitude of being slagger. &gt;&gt; That's what the Bible is saying. The slothful man roasteth not that which he took in hunting, but the substance &gt;&gt; the prey of a diligent man is how &gt;&gt; precious. &gt;&gt; So a man that is diligent as soon as this come into his hand, he said, "Thank you Jesus for giving me this. &gt;&gt; So what should I do &gt;&gt; with what you have given to me &gt;&gt; so that I can utilize this? &gt;&gt; You brought this for my blessing. But if you don't know what to do, you will spoil it. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Please shake somebody's hand. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; I'm going to get to those who spend a lot. [Laughter] &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's go to Proverb 13:4. I'm dealing with this slagger. Amen. &gt;&gt; If you dare, you can say amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The Bible says the soul verse four of a slagger does what? &gt;&gt; Desire. &gt;&gt; So this slagger is not that because he's a slagger he doesn't have wishes. &gt;&gt; No, he does have wishes. &gt;&gt; He desire to have a big life. Right. &gt;&gt; Don't say amen, my friend. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The slugger has desire. &gt;&gt; Yes, he does. &gt;&gt; A lot of them. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He can sit and he say, I want to drive a car like so and so. &gt;&gt; I want to have a house like so and so. I also want my children to do like this. &gt;&gt; He has desire. &gt;&gt; The problem is he's a slugger. &gt;&gt; And what happened to his desire? Verse four, the soul of the slagger desires and has water. &gt;&gt; So it's a man that will never be satisfied of his desire. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; His desire will never never be fulfilled. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He will go to the grave with unfinished desires. [Music] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Even if he desire, he say I want to build a house. that say because he doesn't do what is necessary to get a house &gt;&gt; before you know it he will be renting all his life. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So the desire of a slagger stays in his heart. &gt;&gt; The desire buried in the heart. &gt;&gt; There is a tombstone on the desire. He's a man full of theory. &gt;&gt; Full of theory. &gt;&gt; Full of project. &gt;&gt; Unful fulfill project. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm I'm I'm just describing you this man. &gt;&gt; Then we going to take off. &gt;&gt; We together. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We together. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To go to Proverb 18. If you dare, you can say amen. &gt;&gt; Proverb 18, just keep your Bible. &gt;&gt; If I tell you all of this, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Where is he coming from with this? Proverb 18:9. If you dare, you can say amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't get tired. It's just the beginning, my friend. &gt;&gt; The Bible say, "He also that is who? slothful &gt;&gt; in his work is a brother to him that is a great what &gt;&gt; waster. &gt;&gt; So the slugger always have friend of people that spend too much. &gt;&gt; I'm reading your Bible my friend. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Have I said something wrong? a slagger. &gt;&gt; A slagger. You will think because he doesn't work, &gt;&gt; he will be spending less. &gt;&gt; No, he's the one that spend a lot, &gt;&gt; but he doesn't want to work &gt;&gt; because he's always friend to the spender. &gt;&gt; He want adventures, &gt;&gt; but he doesn't want to bring the income &gt;&gt; for the adventure. &gt;&gt; So, whatever he gets, he burns it. As soon as money come, it's wasting. &gt;&gt; As soon as before the paycheck come on Friday, &gt;&gt; the paycheck is already gone. &gt;&gt; And the paycheck is very skinny one &gt;&gt; because he doesn't want to work. &gt;&gt; Have I said something wrong? &gt;&gt; Have I said something wrong? Brother Angelo said no. So it's a friend of the westernus. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You want to find him? Go around. Those who waste the money, &gt;&gt; they hang out somewhere in downtown. &gt;&gt; Are you working? No. I got fired. &gt;&gt; So you eating on the expensive restaurant and you got fired. Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, okay. You want me to preach the seven seal? This is the seventh seal. The seven seal open up everything. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Go to Proverb 20. &gt;&gt; The slagger. I'm describing this so you find yourself where you are &gt;&gt; before we take off. Proverb 20:4. If you dare, you can say amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The slagger will not plow by reason of what? &gt;&gt; It's a person who usually doesn't want to move out of a comfort zone. &gt;&gt; And God is bringing a solution. This cold is not the cold of the winter &gt;&gt; because you don't plow in the winter. You plow in the fall. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But this man doesn't want to move from a comfort zone. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If it's a comfort zone, he doesn't want to do it. But the motive behind it, he just doesn't want to work. &gt;&gt; The Bible say he doesn't want to go uh plat. Therefore shall he beg &gt;&gt; in harvest and have what? &gt;&gt; Nothing. &gt;&gt; Why are you begging? [Music] &gt;&gt; What were you doing when the season came to plow? &gt;&gt; Where were you when it was plowing season? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Go to Proverb 21. We moving forward, my friend. Verse 25. If you dare, you can say amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The desire verse 25. The desire of the slothful does what? &gt;&gt; Killth him. &gt;&gt; Full of worries. &gt;&gt; He has desire, but the desire does what? &gt;&gt; Killth him. &gt;&gt; He's he's eaten up. &gt;&gt; By his own desire. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because they never come true. His dream never come true. &gt;&gt; His desire kills him for his hand refused to neighbor. He knows what to do, &gt;&gt; but he doesn't want to do it. &gt;&gt; So he stay in an imaginary world. &gt;&gt; Until he dies poor. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? Amen. &gt;&gt; Job to uh chapter 22:E 13. [Laughter] If you dare, you can say amen. &gt;&gt; You there? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The slothful man says what? &gt;&gt; There is a lion without. &gt;&gt; There is a lion outside. &gt;&gt; I is my Bible different. &gt;&gt; There is a lion where? &gt;&gt; Outside. &gt;&gt; I shall be slain in the water street. &gt;&gt; Usually they have poor irrational excuses. &gt;&gt; Are we together? Amen. &gt;&gt; It's poor &gt;&gt; irrational &gt;&gt; excuses. Why are you not doing this? They will come up with an excuse. &gt;&gt; In other words, they will fabricate even an excuse &gt;&gt; to prove the reason why they're not they're not doing what they supposed to do. &gt;&gt; Jesus. &gt;&gt; But God is bringing a solution. &gt;&gt; Go to the end. &gt;&gt; Are we together? We talking about taking advantage of the season. &gt;&gt; We clear, my friend. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Jump to Proverb 24. [Laughter] &gt;&gt; Ah yeah yeah yeah yeah. My my my my hallelujah. &gt;&gt; 24:30. If you dare, you can say amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Solomon say I went by the field of water. &gt;&gt; So a slo is not that he doesn't have anything. He owns a field. &gt;&gt; God gave it to him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God gave him some field. &gt;&gt; God gave him resources. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Solomon say, "I went by the way of a of a slugger." Amen. By the field of a slugger. &gt;&gt; And by the vineyard of a man void of water. &gt;&gt; Understand? &gt;&gt; So it's a lack of wisdom somewhere. There is a field and there is a vineyard. God granted them resources. But what happened? Verse uh uh uh 31. And lo, it was all grown over with what? &gt;&gt; Thorn. &gt;&gt; So it's a man who wast &gt;&gt; the resources that God put on him &gt;&gt; in his life. He say it's full of thorn and water. &gt;&gt; Nettles &gt;&gt; and water &gt;&gt; that covered the face thereof. &gt;&gt; And the stone wall was what? They're all broken down. &gt;&gt; It's usually people who are very negligent. [Music] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The toilet bowl is destroyed. You will take three years to fix it. &gt;&gt; I don't know where that one came from, &gt;&gt; but I have to deliver it, my friend. &gt;&gt; They keep procrastinating things over and over. And the house look like a mess. &gt;&gt; Amen. Lord, &gt;&gt; can I continue? &gt;&gt; Can I continue? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Then I saw verse 32. And consider it well and look upon it and receive what &gt;&gt; instruction. &gt;&gt; Yet what? &gt;&gt; A little sleep. &gt;&gt; He's repeating again. A little slumber, a little folding of a hand to sleep shall water. &gt;&gt; Thy poverty come as one that travelth &gt;&gt; and your want as an armen. Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. Go to proverb 26. Then we finish with proverb. &gt;&gt; We are describing the proud man. &gt;&gt; Proverb 26. &gt;&gt; Verse 16. If you dare, you can say amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because I told you before, this man is proud. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Some of you say amen. Some didn't say amen. &gt;&gt; But now you're going to say amen. &gt;&gt; Proverb 26:E16. If you dare, you can say amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The slagger is wiser in his own conceit. &gt;&gt; In other words, he's wiser in his own eyes. &gt;&gt; When you talk to them, they have a big head. &gt;&gt; They know everything. &gt;&gt; Yet they are suffering. &gt;&gt; You cannot tell them anything. &gt;&gt; They already know a lot. Am I saying something? &gt;&gt; The Bible say that the the the the slider is wiser. It's a proud man. &gt;&gt; He cannot take instruction. &gt;&gt; He cannot humble himself to follow instruction. &gt;&gt; He say he's wiser how? &gt;&gt; In in his own conceit. &gt;&gt; And he's wiser in his own conceit than what? &gt;&gt; Seven men &gt;&gt; that can render a what? &gt;&gt; A reason. In other words, this man think he's greater than seven men. &gt;&gt; If you notice, not one man, &gt;&gt; not two men, &gt;&gt; not three men, but he think he's greater than seven men. Why seven men? Because seven men hold the wisdom of God. &gt;&gt; Are we together? Are we together? Are we together? This cloud was made by seven angels and the seven angel work with the seven messengers. But the slider thinks he knows more than the cloud. He thinks he knows more than the messenger. &gt;&gt; He thinks he knows more than the message. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Barnam says this, my friend, in the message shalom. He said just exactly like he showed us in the seven churches, what would come &gt;&gt; just what? &gt;&gt; Exactly. &gt;&gt; What he showed us what would come when he set that light right there. &gt;&gt; Amen. Up there in revelation to it to show what &gt;&gt; the world. &gt;&gt; When he sent what? &gt;&gt; The seven angels &gt;&gt; to do what? &gt;&gt; Reveal the seven messengers &gt;&gt; that he had been through. that we've been through down there and show the loose end each angel coming when &gt;&gt; each day &gt;&gt; and revealing the loose end that who &gt;&gt; Luther left &gt;&gt; and who &gt;&gt; Wesley left &gt;&gt; and who &gt;&gt; Pentecost left &gt;&gt; it all represented what &gt;&gt; in there. &gt;&gt; So a man that think he knows more than Christ &gt;&gt; because the highest order of the earth is the messenger &gt;&gt; and God wisdom is upon the messenger. You cannot know more than William Marion Bran. I'm not talking about the man, but I'm talking about the God that was in the land. Because we are not feeding upon the word of man, but we are feeding upon the unfailing body word of the Solomon. The messages are absolute. The word is your top. Humble yourself under the message. Hallelujah. Glory to God. Whatever you do be under the message because the message is the wisdom of God. &gt;&gt; It is the cloud my friend. &gt;&gt; It is the head of God. It is the intelligence of God. It is the wisdom of God that have been sent to make you prosper in everything that you do. Oh, glory to God. We thank God for the cloud. We thank God for the message and not only one message but a message that summarize everything. What Paul had, what Aranius had, what Luther and Martin put together and given unto us by one. &gt;&gt; My brother, let's humble &gt;&gt; under the message of Yahweh. &gt;&gt; Are we clear? &gt;&gt; Are we clear? &gt;&gt; This man usually think we just left the airport. So keep your seat belt. The airplane is still going. &gt;&gt; This man think he knows more &gt;&gt; than seven men. &gt;&gt; He knows more than Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's go to uh Matthew 25. Then we finish our reading. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If you dare, you can say amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; You will still keep your Bible &gt;&gt; cuz we're going to dive into something here. &gt;&gt; If you there, you can say amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You there? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Your board is filling up quick. &gt;&gt; Matthew 25, very familiar. Again, wisdom versus foolishness. Then shall what? &gt;&gt; The kingdom of heaven. &gt;&gt; Continue, my friend. &gt;&gt; Be likened unto 10 virgins, &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. &gt;&gt; which took their lamps, &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. and went forth to meet the bridegroom. &gt;&gt; And five of them were how &gt;&gt; wise &gt;&gt; it's wisdom. And five of them were how &gt;&gt; foolish. &gt;&gt; Now they that were foolish what? &gt;&gt; Took their lamps. &gt;&gt; Uh-huh. &gt;&gt; And took no oil with them. &gt;&gt; So there was a time of preparation. &gt;&gt; There was a season of preparation &gt;&gt; before meeting the bridegroom. &gt;&gt; And in the season of preparation, somebody was working. &gt;&gt; Amen. And somebody else was not working. &gt;&gt; And the wise were working, &gt;&gt; but the foolish were not working. &gt;&gt; But both of them were given the same season. &gt;&gt; But one took advantage &gt;&gt; of the time of preparation &gt;&gt; to prepare for the future meeting of the bride. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The Bible say they that were foolish, verse three, took what? their lamps &gt;&gt; and took what? &gt;&gt; No oil with them. &gt;&gt; But the wise did what? &gt;&gt; Took oil in their vessels with their lamps. &gt;&gt; Why did the wise took oil? &gt;&gt; What were the what what was going on in the wise? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. They told them the bridegroom is coming. &gt;&gt; And for some reason they say the bridegroom is coming. &gt;&gt; Okay, we all have the lamp. &gt;&gt; Both the foolish and the wise have lamps. Yes. &gt;&gt; But the wise when they knew that the bridegroom was coming, &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; the wise went and took an an extra oil, &gt;&gt; a second oil. &gt;&gt; Not the oil only in the lamp, but an oil for reserve &gt;&gt; just in case. &gt;&gt; In other words, the wise virgin were not really looking at the time. &gt;&gt; They were looking at the average time. They were preparing beyond the time. &gt;&gt; They are in the summer, but they're looking at the winter. &gt;&gt; They are gathering in the summer, but they are preparing for the winter. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; If you come in the summer, they have oil. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; But if you come to the winter, they also have oil. &gt;&gt; But but with the foolish, when you come in the winter, there is no more oil. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So this wisdom is here demonstrated by the ability to foresee. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's stay put. Foresee the future and prepare for the future. And God called them wise. &gt;&gt; Because if you notice, they were going to meet the bridegroom &gt;&gt; in the evening &gt;&gt; because the bridegroom came at midnight. Follow me my friend. &gt;&gt; They were going to meet the bridegroom in the evening. And there is a key that Jesus says. &gt;&gt; The Bible says in the book of John chapter 9:4, Jesus say, "I must do what?" &gt;&gt; Work the works. &gt;&gt; The work of him that sent me while it's what? &gt;&gt; It is day. &gt;&gt; So work is only done during the day. &gt;&gt; Forget about your job. I'm talking about work right here. Before some of you begin to get in trouble. &gt;&gt; Those that work third shift, leave the third shift alone. &gt;&gt; Are we together? Are we together? Jesus said, "Why is what day &gt;&gt; and the night come &gt;&gt; when no man can do what?" &gt;&gt; So if you want to work, if you want to find the oil, &gt;&gt; you need to find the oil during the day. Because when the night will come, even the seller of the all will close. &gt;&gt; Walmart will close the night. &gt;&gt; Target will close the night. &gt;&gt; So if you want to get something, you better get it during the day. &gt;&gt; This is what Jesus is saying. &gt;&gt; But do you know when did the braon came? He came at midnight. And there is a mystery about midnight. The Bible says in the book of Luke 11:5, "And he said unto them, which of you shall have a what? &gt;&gt; A friend." &gt;&gt; Remember this is a friend. And shall go unto him when &gt;&gt; at midnight. &gt;&gt; Do you follow me? &gt;&gt; And say unto him what? &gt;&gt; Friend. &gt;&gt; Lend me what? &gt;&gt; Three loaves. &gt;&gt; For a friend of mine in his journeys come to me, and I have nothing to set before him. And he from within shall answer and say what? &gt;&gt; Trouble me not. &gt;&gt; The door is how? now shut &gt;&gt; and my children are away &gt;&gt; with me in bed. &gt;&gt; I cannot rise and do it &gt;&gt; and give thee. &gt;&gt; So midnight is the most unfortunate time &gt;&gt; to get something even from your friend. &gt;&gt; I'm reading the Bible. &gt;&gt; And this is the time Jesus came. &gt;&gt; This is the time the bridegroom came. So if you need to get the all, get the all before midnight &gt;&gt; because at midnight the store are closed. &gt;&gt; Even your friend won't give it to you. &gt;&gt; Do you follow me? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Do you follow me? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There is a mystery about the coming of the bridegroom. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The Bible says this, glory to God. In the book of Mark 13:35, the Bible Jesus said, "Watch he ye therefore, for ye know not when &gt;&gt; the master of the house coming." &gt;&gt; So there is a time that the master can come. There is a window. &gt;&gt; Ah &gt;&gt; my friend, you can verify your Bible. &gt;&gt; There is four windows. &gt;&gt; The first window is what? &gt;&gt; At evening. &gt;&gt; At evening. That's right. &gt;&gt; And this is what all the virgin were waiting. &gt;&gt; But they didn't know there were other season. &gt;&gt; Do you follow me? &gt;&gt; And the wise work for the next season. [Music] &gt;&gt; What is the next my friend? &gt;&gt; At midnight. &gt;&gt; So the bridegroom can come at what time? &gt;&gt; Midnight. &gt;&gt; And in Matthew 25, when did he come? &gt;&gt; Midnight. &gt;&gt; So there is a secret of the season &gt;&gt; of the coming of the bridegroom. If he doesn't come at the evening, &gt;&gt; watch the midnight. &gt;&gt; In other words, if you preparing for the evening, &gt;&gt; prepare beyond evening &gt;&gt; because he may come at midnight, &gt;&gt; which he did. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Midnight. The third one is what? &gt;&gt; Or at the crowing. &gt;&gt; Uh-huh. &gt;&gt; At the crowing. &gt;&gt; Amen. And what else, my friend? &gt;&gt; Or in the morning. &gt;&gt; Or in the morning. D in the morning. Amen. So when they say go meet the bridegroom, &gt;&gt; which season are you working on? &gt;&gt; The foolish were working for the evening. &gt;&gt; And the evening the bridegroom Terry &gt;&gt; and they all slumber and slept &gt;&gt; and all the lamp were going out. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And at midnight this is when the bridegroom came. So the one who had oil in reserve &gt;&gt; for the oncoming season &gt;&gt; sir. &gt;&gt; Amen sir &gt;&gt; is the one that got inside &gt;&gt; and got the bridegroom. Everybody that thought is going to happen right here &gt;&gt; miss it. They had to go at midnight to try to find the old and the bridegroom came. &gt;&gt; So the virgin will prepare whether he come at midnight. If they come, if he come a roll, &gt;&gt; if he come in the morning, we don't need any more oil. &gt;&gt; Because it's the day. &gt;&gt; You didn't get me, my friend. You didn't get me, my friend. &gt;&gt; You didn't get me, my friend. They got the oil for the evening. &gt;&gt; And the oil for the evening was finished. Then the second oil open up to keep them at the midnight all the way to the crocking. But in the morning we don't need oil anymore because it's a daylight. Now the bridegroom can come. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; They knew how to take opportunity. Take advantage of the season for another season. &gt;&gt; When God is doing something, watch your future. We are a prophetic people. A prophetic people. Look toward the hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Turn your 45 minute on my friend. &gt;&gt; According to Ecclesiast 3:1, the Bible say to what? &gt;&gt; Everything. &gt;&gt; There is what? &gt;&gt; A season. Remember, this season is not your season, &gt;&gt; but it's God's season for you. &gt;&gt; It is God's season for you &gt;&gt; because it's God's season. Whatever he said must happen. &gt;&gt; Whether people like it or not, &gt;&gt; whether the time is good or not, &gt;&gt; the clock is not our clock. &gt;&gt; The clock is his clock. If he find me in the wilderness, he will create squirrel. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To everything that is under this earth, there is a time. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? Amen. &gt;&gt; And the Bible say in Genesis 8:22, while the earth does what &gt;&gt; is going on? Sea time &gt;&gt; and water &gt;&gt; and harvest &gt;&gt; and water &gt;&gt; and cold and water and heat and water &gt;&gt; and summer and water and winter and water &gt;&gt; and day and water and night shall never cease. &gt;&gt; This is God's program. &gt;&gt; It revolve all the time. &gt;&gt; You will have season going on over and over until you get to eternity. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And brother Bham say that everything comes right in its season. Amen. &gt;&gt; To everything, &gt;&gt; there is a season. &gt;&gt; And it's not just a season, but it's God's season for your life. &gt;&gt; And now we call it because it's God's season for my life. I call that my season. &gt;&gt; In other words, my divine season, &gt;&gt; my Godgiving season has stood the test. Therefore, my season have come to be blessed. And in the season, everything comes right. &gt;&gt; In the season, you don't push. &gt;&gt; You don't force because it's not you doing the work. It is God doing the work in his own season. &gt;&gt; Are we together? Because when the noise of a man pleases the Lord, he make even at peace his enemy. God will move everything. Even if it's the Red Sea, he will pardon. If it's the Jordan, he will pardon. If it's the world, he will bring them down. &gt;&gt; Why? Because the time has come. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Why is everything happening nice in a season? &gt;&gt; Why does it happen right in a season? Brother Brandham said, "Do you believe that?" &gt;&gt; He says, "What?" &gt;&gt; Everything &gt;&gt; you plant the wheat. Now &gt;&gt; in the fall of the year, &gt;&gt; in the spring of the year, it does what? &gt;&gt; It brings itself forward. &gt;&gt; Or what? &gt;&gt; God brings it forth. &gt;&gt; The key behind the season, it's God doing the work. &gt;&gt; It is no longer you doing the work. Even if you are doing the work, it is God in you &gt;&gt; who's doing the work. &gt;&gt; It is God in me now who's doing the preaching. &gt;&gt; Because the time of the preaching has come. &gt;&gt; It is no longer me. I was not feeling good but now I feel good because the God Almighty has come to use the vessel. &gt;&gt; In other word when you going in season it's automatic shift my friend. &gt;&gt; You don't go one two. No no no no no no. It's automatic. You just put drive and all you do you put the foot on the pedal. And sometime you can even put a cruise control and you let the car run itself because somebody's driving the car. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And I learn in this world I learn a long time. My life is not my own. &gt;&gt; So I put my life in you. You take me and lead me. &gt;&gt; Are we together? Because even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I feel no evil, God is with me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Brother says this, my friend. He said Jesus was speaking. He says what? &gt;&gt; Fatherhu, &gt;&gt; the time has come. &gt;&gt; Now there is a season for what? &gt;&gt; Everything. &gt;&gt; Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; Amen. You saw when &gt;&gt; in a certain season &gt;&gt; and you reap when &gt;&gt; in a certain season &gt;&gt; now there is a season when what &gt;&gt; the time comes &gt;&gt; right that's the time comes that is right for what &gt;&gt; things to happen &gt;&gt; season bring the right time &gt;&gt; for certain things to happen &gt;&gt; when it's the season the time have come for something to happen &gt;&gt; are Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Even if the delivery make a mistake. &gt;&gt; Because it's the seasonal, &gt;&gt; everything will work together for good. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Why is all the supernatural things happen? Because it's the season. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Listen to this with brother Brham. Brother Branam say we pray what &gt;&gt; this prayer &gt;&gt; because we know &gt;&gt; what do we know &gt;&gt; that it what &gt;&gt; is in season &gt;&gt; because I know that it's a season. &gt;&gt; I'm praying. &gt;&gt; I'm praying. &gt;&gt; Some of the prayer &gt;&gt; are answered after &gt;&gt; because it was not the season. That's why sometime you pray &gt;&gt; something nothing happen. &gt;&gt; Sometime you pray automatically boom because it's the time &gt;&gt; and you get frustrated. You say I pray yesterday nothing happened. So God doesn't hear me. That's not the case. God always answer prayer but God work with a season. If it's a season, automatic response. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Pam said, because we know that it's what &gt;&gt; is in season. &gt;&gt; For that said, I will I will I will with thee even to the what? &gt;&gt; The end of the world. &gt;&gt; The things that I do shall owe you also, even greater. For I go to who? &gt;&gt; My father. &gt;&gt; I know that we are praying right &gt;&gt; because thou has always desired to do what? &gt;&gt; Fulfill thy word. You watch over it to do what? &gt;&gt; Finally. &gt;&gt; In other words, brother Brandham is telling God, anoint the season. &gt;&gt; And if the season you send your word, it won't return to you back. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He must accomplish that which you send because the season has come. &gt;&gt; And because it's the season, I know I'm praying right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In other words, it's a type of faith that is not coming from you. &gt;&gt; It is the faith of the season. If somebody is sitting beside you, they will think you crazy &gt;&gt; because you are believing the impossible. &gt;&gt; Leave me alone. It's not your season. It is my season. Let me take God and his life. &gt;&gt; Brother says God deal with the gentile individual. &gt;&gt; We might be twins &gt;&gt; but we are individual. &gt;&gt; So when I'm entering my season, don't disturb me. work for your season. Let me believe God for what he promised me. What he said must happen because it's the season. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said I must not stand on the way of somebody who want to take God at his word. &gt;&gt; Stay with your internet. me my season. Money or no money, I have the creator of everything. I have all the God that possess everything. He will be there for me because in the season everything comes right. Oh, glory to God. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. When you praying, &gt;&gt; when you praying and you feel that anointing coming up, &gt;&gt; don't leave &gt;&gt; because it's no longer you. &gt;&gt; It's a different gift from heaven. &gt;&gt; Let him pray. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. There are sometime we pray &gt;&gt; and we forcing &gt;&gt; but there are sometime you just start praying &gt;&gt; and you feel like it's an automatic pilot that is taking you my friend don't get out. &gt;&gt; Stay right there and pray it on. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Because it's not you praying. It is the spirit of the Lord in your life that is praying. If the anointing fall on the church &gt;&gt; and they are worshiping, don't run away. Stay right there. It's a season. Stay there. Take advantage of the anointing. Take advantage of the season. Hallelujah. Our busy schedule have blocked our blessing because we're looking at the clock. We're looking at the clock. We're looking at the clock. You're going to go out and face that same demon. But I want to be like Jacob when I catch the angel. I'm not going to let you go. I'm not going to let you go until you bless me. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. I don't know. Oh, glory to God. &gt;&gt; I don't know when I will see the angel again. &gt;&gt; Maybe this is the only time I met the angel of the Lord. &gt;&gt; You can fire me, but I must deal with the angel. Change me. &gt;&gt; A man overcame God. &gt;&gt; A man who knew how to seize opportunity. Do you know what? Even God himself punch him &gt;&gt; to discourage him, &gt;&gt; but he says no. Even though you slay me, &gt;&gt; yet I trust you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Taking advantage of the season. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You can remove your seat belt. Amen. &gt;&gt; As we moving, my friend, &gt;&gt; are we okay? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we okay? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. &gt;&gt; Last Sunday. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Last Sunday. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. &gt;&gt; Last Sunday. Amen. &gt;&gt; We so some &gt;&gt; 1 verse three. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We found that a tree &gt;&gt; have every apple &gt;&gt; inside the tree. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You don't go to the apple tree &gt;&gt; and you say apple tree we want to add the apple. &gt;&gt; The apple are there. &gt;&gt; If you open the tree you won't see the apple &gt;&gt; but they are there. Just wait for the season &gt;&gt; and sometime that tree may go through winter &gt;&gt; and it look like there is no leaf &gt;&gt; but the apple are there. &gt;&gt; You say tree how are you doing? He say I'm doing okay. &gt;&gt; The apple are there. &gt;&gt; Because by the problem say in winter the life goes into the root. &gt;&gt; The root is a protection against winter &gt;&gt; and you have a root &gt;&gt; and the offspring of death. In other words, there is a part in your life that the devil won't enter. [Applause] &gt;&gt; There is a part of your life where the devil won't enter. &gt;&gt; The devil can move. He can move. He can who move in which a time they say authorized personnel only. You are not authorized in this area. This area is an area of deity. Only God enter here &gt;&gt; because you can cut it branch, &gt;&gt; you can destroy everything, but as long as the root is there, &gt;&gt; the root can rebuild the whole tree. &gt;&gt; Because everything, all things is in the root. Are we together? &gt;&gt; So the tree got every apple. &gt;&gt; Not every apple for one season. &gt;&gt; Every apple for the lifetime &gt;&gt; of the tree is inside the tree. &gt;&gt; But those apple don't come out all at one time and one time. That's why don't expect everything you want to happen in one time. God knows when is the right time to give you what you just drink and push out. Drink and push out. Drink and push out. &gt;&gt; What are you doing? I'm listening to the message. I'm reading my Bible. I am praying. I am going to church. Suddenly a season open up. Everything is rolling with my strength, with the strength of almighty God. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Why do we push? &gt;&gt; Why do we struggle? &gt;&gt; Relax, my friend. &gt;&gt; All is well. Shalom. &gt;&gt; Everything is okay. &gt;&gt; If it doesn't happen, I already put my petition. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We found out that everything &gt;&gt; that the tree needed &gt;&gt; is in the tree. But the Bible say the fruit don't come up all the all the time. &gt;&gt; The fruit come up when &gt;&gt; in the season. &gt;&gt; So if the tree is not in the season &gt;&gt; did you ever seen did this tree complaining to you? &gt;&gt; No &gt;&gt; that this is winter. &gt;&gt; I don't have any fruit in winter. &gt;&gt; No they are crown &gt;&gt; because they know their circle. Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Can I say something? &gt;&gt; He won't offend you, right? &gt;&gt; Every egg a woman has &gt;&gt; is born with her a child birth. &gt;&gt; Every m she releases, &gt;&gt; do you control that? There is an intelligence &gt;&gt; that is controlling your body. &gt;&gt; Tell that intelligence control my heart &gt;&gt; so my heart will beat good control my kidney control my leg control my back. Control my shoulder because I know you controlling my body. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; God is already working in you. &gt;&gt; We want to feel the chills. &gt;&gt; Who make you breathe? &gt;&gt; Do you tell your heart to be? &gt;&gt; When you sleep, who's protecting your heart? &gt;&gt; And it's always on time. Who who who's there? Why is Satan not doing anything when you're sleeping? &gt;&gt; Because the angel of the Lord can't run those that fear him. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So according to Psalm 1, &gt;&gt; according to Psalm 1 verse three, &gt;&gt; the fruit &gt;&gt; comes when? &gt;&gt; In season. &gt;&gt; Amen. So you cannot go to the tree &gt;&gt; on the on the uh I mean in winter &gt;&gt; and say tree I need the fruit. &gt;&gt; The tree will look at you and say &gt;&gt; you miss the season. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; On you produce fruit and water. &gt;&gt; But I have a news for you. [Music] What is the what is what is the surprise &gt;&gt; in Mark? In Mark 11 &gt;&gt; verse 12, &gt;&gt; the creator &gt;&gt; of heaven and earth. &gt;&gt; The one who created the season. &gt;&gt; The one who is behind the season. &gt;&gt; The one who knows the season. &gt;&gt; He got hungry. &gt;&gt; You want to go home? &gt;&gt; He got hungry. The Bible say and on the water &gt;&gt; when they were come from what &gt;&gt; he was what? &gt;&gt; Hungry &gt;&gt; and seeing a water &gt;&gt; a big tree &gt;&gt; a far off having water &gt;&gt; leaves. &gt;&gt; If the tree have leaves which season are we in &gt;&gt; spring &gt;&gt; I'm going to get today &gt;&gt; we got a tree. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Having what? Please, &gt;&gt; the tree is in springtime. &gt;&gt; Do you have fruit in spring? &gt;&gt; We can take this different direction, my friend. &gt;&gt; You might be a treeh &gt;&gt; because it's a fig tree &gt;&gt; and the tree have leaves. In the garden of Eden, when Adam and Eve sinned, &gt;&gt; they went to the fig tree &gt;&gt; and they got the leaves to cover themselves, &gt;&gt; which was religion. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In in Genesis 1, &gt;&gt; they didn't leave. No, they didn't need any covering. &gt;&gt; But they were naked, &gt;&gt; but they didn't know it. &gt;&gt; But in Genesis 2, even though they put covering, &gt;&gt; they still remember they were naked. So God clothing was better than that. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; So we found the fig tree having leaves &gt;&gt; and Jesus came and cursed the tree. &gt;&gt; He cursed religion. &gt;&gt; That's one angle. &gt;&gt; The tree also fig tree represent Israel. &gt;&gt; That's also another angle. Let me leave those angle. &gt;&gt; Let me maneuver the airplane into a different angle. Our end goal today is this because brother Bham say scripture has accompanied me that free me my friend &gt;&gt; that one free me because I know now that since the seventh seal is open I can get a different angle &gt;&gt; because scripture I loaded &gt;&gt; scripture have layers &gt;&gt; let's look at this angle s &gt;&gt; the tree is the heaven leaves Amen. And he Jesus if what came &gt;&gt; perhaps &gt;&gt; he may find what? &gt;&gt; Anything there on &gt;&gt; if he can find some fruit there. &gt;&gt; And when he came to it he found what? Nothing but &gt;&gt; but what &gt;&gt; because &gt;&gt; for the time &gt;&gt; of the fig was not what &gt;&gt; whose fault is it? &gt;&gt; Was it the fault of the tree? &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; The tree accord &gt;&gt; the tree according to someone &gt;&gt; it produce fruit. So Jesus should know better. [Applause] Shake somebody's hand. Tell him, "Are you still awake?" &gt;&gt; If you refocus, you tell me. &gt;&gt; If you refocus, you say, "Amen." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? Now, how can the creator &gt;&gt; the creator &gt;&gt; who created all things &gt;&gt; who laid out the season &gt;&gt; miss the season &gt;&gt; and go into a tree &gt;&gt; when it's not the time &gt;&gt; when it's not the season &gt;&gt; of the fruit yet &gt;&gt; and Jesus went to look for the fruit &gt;&gt; and when he command &gt;&gt; that there is no fruit &gt;&gt; because it's not the time &gt;&gt; instead of sparing the tree &gt;&gt; and say ah I remember &gt;&gt; you only produce fruit &gt;&gt; in season &gt;&gt; no Jesus didn't do that &gt;&gt; he turned around &gt;&gt; amen &gt;&gt; and the third pool anointed Am I saying something different? The thirdpool anointing came &gt;&gt; and Jesus spoke the word &gt;&gt; and touched that tree. &gt;&gt; And father pam say he was preaching the gospel to that tree &gt;&gt; because tomorrow on the tomorrow when they came up &gt;&gt; the tree has wither away &gt;&gt; and the disciples said look at that &gt;&gt; and Jesus open up the third pool. He said if you say to this mountain &gt;&gt; be moved &gt;&gt; the mountain will move &gt;&gt; if you don't that in your heart &gt;&gt; but my problem is the creator should be coming in season &gt;&gt; let's nail it again Brother Bradam says this. He said, "And then when he was going, he found water, &gt;&gt; a fig tree." &gt;&gt; The next morning that the tree had water, &gt;&gt; leaves on it. &gt;&gt; And he thought &gt;&gt; perhaps &gt;&gt; he will find what? &gt;&gt; Some figs. &gt;&gt; So he went to get what? &gt;&gt; Some figs &gt;&gt; in the wrong season. &gt;&gt; And there was what? &gt;&gt; No figs on it. &gt;&gt; Because it was not what &gt;&gt; season yet. &gt;&gt; And he said to the tree, "No man eat it from the h forth. Brother Steven, &gt;&gt; fruit comes when? &gt;&gt; Jesus went out of season. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Fruit comes in season. &gt;&gt; According to Mark, he went out of season. &gt;&gt; And because nothing was out of season, he open up the spoken word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; What are you trying to get us to? &gt;&gt; Now we begin to understand something different. &gt;&gt; That God is in season and out of season. &gt;&gt; Brother Robert, my time. My time, my friend. Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; God is not only the God of the season. &gt;&gt; He's also out of season. Open the book of Matthew. &gt;&gt; Go to the book of Matthew, &gt;&gt; chapter 10. &gt;&gt; Go to the book of Matthew, chapter 10. Oh my god, my friend. The airplane is way up there &gt;&gt; and I'm trying to begin to come down. [Laughter] &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Let's go to Matthew 10, my friend. &gt;&gt; My friend, this is in and what? &gt;&gt; Out. If I unload what I have here, you will stay here two more hours. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You are right here. &gt;&gt; You are right here. &gt;&gt; We still have this. &gt;&gt; So don't worry, my friend. &gt;&gt; Hey, stretch your belly. We ready? &gt;&gt; I know. I know. My friend, it's Labor Day. We ready? &gt;&gt; We ready? &gt;&gt; If you pass out, we go CPR. &gt;&gt; Let's go to Matthew 10, my friend. &gt;&gt; Matthew 10:5. If you there, you can say amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's the opening of the seals. &gt;&gt; You there? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You there? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You there? &gt;&gt; Verse five, my friend. Let's go. These 12 Jesus did what? &gt;&gt; Sent forth. &gt;&gt; Remember Jesus is in and what? &gt;&gt; Out of season. &gt;&gt; He says these 12 Jesus sent forth and commanded them, saying what? &gt;&gt; Go not into the way of the Gentiles, and into any city of the Samaritans, enter ye not. But go rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel. &gt;&gt; Let's push the brake a little bit. Keep your finger right there, okay? Because I'm going to read it again. Go to John 1. &gt;&gt; Keep your finger right there. &gt;&gt; Go to John 1. This must shock some of you. &gt;&gt; John 1 chapter 11. If you there, you can say amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The Bible say what? &gt;&gt; He came unto his own. &gt;&gt; Who came? &gt;&gt; Jesus. &gt;&gt; He came to what? &gt;&gt; His own. &gt;&gt; And his own did what? &gt;&gt; Receive him now. &gt;&gt; Stop. Let's read it again. He came to who? &gt;&gt; His own. So when Jesus came on the first coming, he came for who? &gt;&gt; The Jews. &gt;&gt; For the who? &gt;&gt; The Jews. &gt;&gt; He didn't come for you. &gt;&gt; We clear now? &gt;&gt; We clear now. So let's go to Matthew. So according to John 1 verse 11, &gt;&gt; Jesus came to the to Israel. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; To the Jews. And as a matter of fact, it was the Jews that were waiting for the Messiah. &gt;&gt; Not me and you. [Applause] Only the Jews and the Samaritans &gt;&gt; knew about the Messiah. &gt;&gt; Me, all the Gentile didn't know anything about the Messiah. &gt;&gt; We were not even Christian. &gt;&gt; We were hidden. &gt;&gt; We were worshiping Adam. &gt;&gt; So Jesus didn't come to us. &gt;&gt; He came to the Jew. &gt;&gt; He came to his own. &gt;&gt; Follow me, my friend. Now in verse 5, these two have Jesus sent for and commanded them saying go not in the way of what? &gt;&gt; The gentile. &gt;&gt; Who's talking to the disciple? &gt;&gt; Jesus is telling the disciple listen when you preach the gospel don't preach to the gentile. &gt;&gt; Don't don't go to Gastonia. &gt;&gt; Don't go to North Carolina. &gt;&gt; Don't go to the United States. &gt;&gt; Stay in Israel. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. Yes sir. So the so so so the maker himself &gt;&gt; is determining the season. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's clear the season is a Jewish season. &gt;&gt; And Jesus is putting landmark. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Not to cross. &gt;&gt; Don't go to the gentile. &gt;&gt; Let's go, my friend. Uh uh go to the gentile and into what? &gt;&gt; Any city of the Samaritan. &gt;&gt; Not a city. Any city &gt;&gt; of the Samaritan. Don't go. In other words, because there are three group of people. I already gave you the scripture in the hotel. We got the what? &gt;&gt; Jews. &gt;&gt; The Jew. We got who? &gt;&gt; Samaritans. &gt;&gt; We got the Samaritan. And we got who? &gt;&gt; Gentiles. &gt;&gt; The Gentile. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Jesus say go only to the Jew. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't go to the Samaritan. Don't go to the Gentile because he came to water &gt;&gt; and his own water &gt;&gt; Jew. &gt;&gt; So the season is the season of who? &gt;&gt; The Jews. &gt;&gt; Jesus continued. He says verse 6, but go right away where &gt;&gt; to the lost sheep of the house of Israel. &gt;&gt; In other words, precision you only preach to the lost sheep of the house of Israel. Period. So the first coming of the Lord &gt;&gt; was restricted for the Jewish nation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm going slowly, my friend. &gt;&gt; But God is in season. and also out of season. &gt;&gt; The Jews were waiting for him. &gt;&gt; The Samaritan by being under the Jewish religion was also waiting for the Samaritan. &gt;&gt; Was also waiting for the Messiah. Remember the woman at the well. &gt;&gt; But the Gentile were not waiting for him. &gt;&gt; But I got a news for you. &gt;&gt; Go to Matthew 15. Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Go to verse 21. &gt;&gt; If you there, you can say amen. &gt;&gt; Matthew 15. &gt;&gt; You there? &gt;&gt; Matthew 15:21. &gt;&gt; You there? &gt;&gt; Then Jesus went forth from there &gt;&gt; and departed where? &gt;&gt; The ghost of water. Tire and sit on. &gt;&gt; Tire and what? &gt;&gt; Sit on. &gt;&gt; Was that Israel? &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; So what was he doing in the gentile land? If he doesn't have anything to do with the gentile &gt;&gt; according to the to the word of Jesus Christ, Jesus should stay within the borders of Israel. &gt;&gt; He himself venture out. Somebody's not catching it. &gt;&gt; This is Israel. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Tar and Soden are somewhere there &gt;&gt; where Lebanon is. &gt;&gt; Amen. If I'm not mistaken, Jesus should be moving over here. &gt;&gt; For some reason, here it's a season. &gt;&gt; For some reason, Jesus venture out. Are we together? &gt;&gt; But the season is not for the gentile, &gt;&gt; but because he venture out of season. [Music] &gt;&gt; Can I continue? &gt;&gt; What happened? &gt;&gt; Verse 22. &gt;&gt; And behold, a what? &gt;&gt; A woman, &gt;&gt; a church. A woman of water &gt;&gt; came in &gt;&gt; came out of him &gt;&gt; in the water. &gt;&gt; The same coast. &gt;&gt; She came out from where? &gt;&gt; The same coast. &gt;&gt; The Bible say she was a sorrow Phoenician woman. &gt;&gt; A gentile woman &gt;&gt; came out. &gt;&gt; Say you venture in this land. &gt;&gt; You doomed. I don't know if we're together. &gt;&gt; You should stay in Israel. But because you move out of Israel, &gt;&gt; welcome. &gt;&gt; Welcome. There is no &gt;&gt; Are we together? Verse 22. And he came and did what? &gt;&gt; And cried to him, saying what? &gt;&gt; Have mercy on me. &gt;&gt; Oh, &gt;&gt; Lord. &gt;&gt; You who? Thou son of David, &gt;&gt; my daughter is what? &gt;&gt; Previously back, &gt;&gt; she's using the season of the Jew. &gt;&gt; Son of David, &gt;&gt; but it was not her season. &gt;&gt; I hope you are understanding. He's using the season of the Jew, but it was not her season. &gt;&gt; She begin to use the language of the season. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Verse 23, what happened? &gt;&gt; But he answered her not a word. &gt;&gt; Jesus did what? &gt;&gt; Answered her not a word. &gt;&gt; Why? &gt;&gt; It was not her season. &gt;&gt; It was not her season. &gt;&gt; In other words, Jesus ignore her &gt;&gt; because it's not your season. Me and you, &gt;&gt; we would have quit. &gt;&gt; Me and you, we would have left the church of Jesus. &gt;&gt; But Jesus met a different breed. &gt;&gt; He was not a Jewish breed. &gt;&gt; He was not a Samaritan breed. It was the gentile where he said don't preach to them. &gt;&gt; The gentile say you trespass. &gt;&gt; You came on my territory. &gt;&gt; I didn't go to you. You the one that came in my territory. You trespass. Are we together? Are we together? And Jesus want to push out and he ignore &gt;&gt; sometime it seems like his service when you are praying but don't give up remember who you are. Are we together? Are we together? Are we together? I'm showing you the behavior of Gentile. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Let's read, my friend. &gt;&gt; Let's read, my friend. &gt;&gt; Verse 23. &gt;&gt; Let's read, my friend. &gt;&gt; Verse 23. &gt;&gt; Verse 23. But Jesus did what? &gt;&gt; Answered her not a word. &gt;&gt; And his disciple came and said, "What?" &gt;&gt; And besought him, &gt;&gt; saying, "What? &gt;&gt; Send her away. &gt;&gt; Push, push the brake." Why did the disciple told Jesus send her away? Because the Because the woman was not stopping. &gt;&gt; Jesus ignore her. &gt;&gt; But instead of the woman looking and say, "Ignore me." The woman was not stopping. She was continuing. Son of David. Son of David. Listen, you are the son of David. You trespass here. Son of David. Son of David. Are we together? Are we together? Jesus is walking around. Son of David, I know who you are. Son of David. Son of David. &gt;&gt; Maybe. Are we together? &gt;&gt; Maybe she went to the ear of Jesus. Son of David. You can ignore me all you want. Son of David. Son of David. Son of David. I don't know if we together. In other words, in other words, this is my opportunity. &gt;&gt; Because Because the footstep of the righteous, [Applause] &gt;&gt; you made a mistake. You trespass this way. &gt;&gt; Are we together? Amen. &gt;&gt; And the disciple look, they say, "Ah, &gt;&gt; this is a noisy woman right here." &gt;&gt; Instead of the disciple, &gt;&gt; instead of the deacon, &gt;&gt; instead of the deacon, &gt;&gt; the disciple &gt;&gt; doing the job &gt;&gt; to push the woman away, &gt;&gt; the disciple could not do it. &gt;&gt; So the woman was more powerful than the disciple. That's why the disciple call for national guard &gt;&gt; this time. Jesus please deal with me. &gt;&gt; In other words, we are trying but this step is stubborn. &gt;&gt; My friend, the disciple were the disciple of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; If the woman is troubling them, what should they have? take the woman away and say, "Sister, you stop coming up here." &gt;&gt; But the disciple could not do it. &gt;&gt; They tried, they cannot. So they went to Jesus. They say, "Please, since you are the one she's following, &gt;&gt; please give her n her &gt;&gt; so she can go. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Where are we at?" &gt;&gt; Verse 24. &gt;&gt; For she cries after after her. Verse 24. But hear and say what? I am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of God. &gt;&gt; He's answering who? &gt;&gt; Finally, Jesus opened up his mouth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Remember all this time Jesus mouth was quiet. &gt;&gt; It was a silence. &gt;&gt; All that the woman was looking for is to open the silence. You didn't get me my friend. The woman was pressing for Jesus to open his mouth because there was service. The servant seal was locked. So she was just waiting for the seals to open up. &gt;&gt; Are we together? Are we together? If Jesus &gt;&gt; would have stayed quiet, &gt;&gt; it would have been better. &gt;&gt; Jesus make again. &gt;&gt; Inverted comeras a big mistake. &gt;&gt; He opened his mouth &gt;&gt; and whatever come out of his mouth he cannot take it back. &gt;&gt; Jesus opened his mouth &gt;&gt; and what is he saying? &gt;&gt; He says I am not sent but to what? &gt;&gt; The lost sheep of the house. In other words, he's telling the woman, "I'm not sent for you. &gt;&gt; This is not your season." &gt;&gt; But he's a God of season and out of season. &gt;&gt; Did the woman stop? &gt;&gt; The woman changed. &gt;&gt; He said, "You don't know me yet." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Then verse 25, what happened? &gt;&gt; She came and worshiped him. &gt;&gt; She came and what? &gt;&gt; Worship him. &gt;&gt; She came and did what? &gt;&gt; Worship him. &gt;&gt; What exactly did she do? &gt;&gt; She say, "I know you, God. Let me worship you." &gt;&gt; In other words, every weapon I'm going to use. &gt;&gt; If this doesn't work, &gt;&gt; this is going to work. Are we together? &gt;&gt; Fight attend and prepare for landing. &gt;&gt; He says and he say he worship him and say what? &gt;&gt; Lord help me. &gt;&gt; Oh finally she used the right approach. &gt;&gt; So she's going to get what she needed. &gt;&gt; Watch again &gt;&gt; because it's not her season. &gt;&gt; And but he answer and say what &gt;&gt; it is not meat &gt;&gt; children's bread. Uh-huh. &gt;&gt; He cast it to the dog. &gt;&gt; Jesus struck back again &gt;&gt; and said, "You don't understand this is not your season. As a matter of fact, you a dog &gt;&gt; and what you asking is the children's bread &gt;&gt; and you are a dog. &gt;&gt; I cannot give it to you. This is not your season." &gt;&gt; The woman said that was your last mistake. &gt;&gt; Please confirmation now. Now that's it. I lock you on the first, on the second, on the third. That's what I was looking for. &gt;&gt; He said, "You know a mystery." &gt;&gt; You already open your mouth. Do you know a mystery? &gt;&gt; You know the dog have a mystery. &gt;&gt; They don't eat the bread. &gt;&gt; Because when the children eat bread, &gt;&gt; crabs are falling. &gt;&gt; The thunderers, &gt;&gt; they lose end. When the children are eating, there is a loose end. lose food. The seven ters are losing in sle. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because throughout the ages, there were mystery that had been lost. &gt;&gt; There were food that were lost. &gt;&gt; When the children were eating and the Malachi for when he comes, he gather not the bread. [Music] the loose end. &gt;&gt; So the gentile look for the loose end. &gt;&gt; That's why the seven seat is important for us &gt;&gt; because he brings the thunder &gt;&gt; and the thunders open the door out of season. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What happened to the woman? Jesus told her, "It's not your season. &gt;&gt; I am not sent for you. I'm sent for the lost sheep of Israel. This is not your season." She could have turned around and go and Jesus struck her with the last one. &gt;&gt; You a dog. &gt;&gt; She didn't say he he he uh uh what you mediating me. &gt;&gt; She said no. Everything that come from your mouth &gt;&gt; is right. I'm going to show you that I don't take beating like that. &gt;&gt; Since you say dog, &gt;&gt; look at the mystery. &gt;&gt; When the mystery hit Jesus, &gt;&gt; Jesus forgot in the season. &gt;&gt; He forgot that it was the season of the Jews. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Jesus says, he says, and she said what? Truth, Lord. Yet what &gt;&gt; the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from the master's table. &gt;&gt; Then Jesus answered and saying to her, "What?" &gt;&gt; Oh woman, &gt;&gt; what &gt;&gt; great is thy faith. &gt;&gt; So what type of faith is that one? &gt;&gt; And that great faith was found where &gt;&gt; and who are you this morning? &gt;&gt; What is God finding in you? Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And oh woman, great is your faith. &gt;&gt; Be it what? &gt;&gt; Unto thee. &gt;&gt; As you what? &gt;&gt; Will. &gt;&gt; Who's willing? &gt;&gt; God or the woman. &gt;&gt; The woman. My brother problem say this woman is a type of antiight. &gt;&gt; And her daughter was what? &gt;&gt; Made whole &gt;&gt; when &gt;&gt; from that very hour. &gt;&gt; And why? Because a woman, a gentile approached Jesus out of season [Music] &gt;&gt; and he opened up the temple. And one day Jesus was entering somewhere and a Roman cention came in. &gt;&gt; Another gentile. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It was not the time of the gentile. The Roman centurion came entering. And he said, "Lord, &gt;&gt; I got a problem in my home." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Jesus turned around. He said, "I will come." He said, "Stop. You don't need to come this way. You are dealing with a different breed. &gt;&gt; We don't need laying on hand. Speak the word. Speak the word. I know we are out of season because we are out of season. Out of season. Open the spoken word. And me and you, we are gentile. And God left the Jews. Let me say something. &gt;&gt; In the time of the Jews, &gt;&gt; in the season of the Jews, &gt;&gt; God opened the third pool. &gt;&gt; And he turned around. He said, "And there's never seen such a great faith." &gt;&gt; Not even in in Israel. Those great faith are always found in the Gentiles. And those great faith push the master &gt;&gt; out of season. &gt;&gt; Are we together? To get what they want. &gt;&gt; But today Jesus left the Jews. &gt;&gt; Now he said the Gentile is at the season. We could take something from Jesus. How about now in the season of the Gentile? Are we together? Are we together? Some of you didn't get me. &gt;&gt; Your example in the Bible is a man and a woman. It's a man and a woman. It's a brother and a sister. Brother Santion and Sister Sophian went out of season and they took what they wanted. Now it is not the Jewish season. It is our season. If God can do that out of season, how much more in season? Whatever you have need of us, speak the word. Speak the word. Take God and his word. Hallelujah. Why? Because it's the season. [Applause] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Brother Robert, I'm going to drop the airplane. I'm going straight to the airport and I'm going to hit the tarmac. I'm going to skip certain things here quickly. We pick them up on Sunday, but let me drop the airplane with this. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Brother Bam says this and I'm going to jump the airplane with this. Brother says this. He said, "Don't know their day." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They don't know their day. The ox does what &gt;&gt; knows his master. And the mule knows what &gt;&gt; knows the star. &gt;&gt; But my people knows not. &gt;&gt; Say God. That is water. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; They don't know the day &gt;&gt; of their visitation. &gt;&gt; It's the finest things to try or the water. &gt;&gt; Strangest thing &gt;&gt; to get God's people to see the day of their visitation. &gt;&gt; Your time &gt;&gt; of the gentile. You are waiting for the rapture, &gt;&gt; but you're going to regret it. My friend, &gt;&gt; I must say this just now because the Holy Spirit seems to be pulling this uh uh seems to be putting it on my heart. Be what? &gt;&gt; Careful. &gt;&gt; Spoken word. Be what? &gt;&gt; Careful. &gt;&gt; Why? Satan &gt;&gt; will try to do what? &gt;&gt; Tell you of something great. &gt;&gt; To tell you of something great way &gt;&gt; off in another age to come. You didn't get it. &gt;&gt; Brother say be careful &gt;&gt; because Satan will always point you way up &gt;&gt; because Satan don't want you to see the season you go into &gt;&gt; because Satan knows if you cross your season you lost your blessings. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He says he wants you to see something where &gt;&gt; great &gt;&gt; where &gt;&gt; way off in another age to come &gt;&gt; or another what &gt;&gt; coming along of another revival &gt;&gt; and you may be living in the last part of it you ever get it may be how &gt;&gt; now &gt;&gt; in other words people are still telling you wait for the brand revival &gt;&gt; wait for the brand revival so what is God doing now &gt;&gt; until the rapture will surprise you &gt;&gt; because you missed the season. &gt;&gt; The seals were open in 63. &gt;&gt; How long are you going to wait for the bride revival? &gt;&gt; Brother say, brother say the Pentecostal are praying. &gt;&gt; Let's fast and pray. Let's fast and pray. Brother Brandham came, he said, you know why they doing that? &gt;&gt; Because they have not recognized &gt;&gt; the awakening of the brother. So when the bride was awakening, people are still looking far away. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Until your children are leaving home, &gt;&gt; until your children are getting married. &gt;&gt; You still waiting for the bride revival. &gt;&gt; No, sir. The bride revival is on. &gt;&gt; It's on right now. &gt;&gt; I am not waiting for something way up. &gt;&gt; I'm in the season, my friend. Some of you are waiting for the for the persecution. &gt;&gt; So you are holding your sickness until they start persecuting the church. No, I'm not holding my sickness right now. [Applause] Let's wait for the pressure of the euical concept so that we will see the third pool. So what happen you lay dormant &gt;&gt; when the third pool is there and brother say I want to declare to you the third pool is here. manifest the third pull anointing started before the opening of the seals. Brother created a squirrel before the opening of the seal. If the anointing was there before the opening of the seals, what do you think when the seals are open? &gt;&gt; It's the preacher. The preacher have limit the faith of the people. We told the people you can go all the way here. But in this church, &gt;&gt; release God. Release God. &gt;&gt; All things are possible. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To him that believe. &gt;&gt; It is a trick of the devil &gt;&gt; to push you in hopes &gt;&gt; in the future. in the future. &gt;&gt; Yesterday was a future. &gt;&gt; Yesterday it was a future. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Today is which day? &gt;&gt; Today is what? &gt;&gt; Sunday. &gt;&gt; Yesterday was Saturday. &gt;&gt; On Friday, Sunday was future. &gt;&gt; On on on Friday, Saturday was future. &gt;&gt; But today on Sunday, Saturday is a past. &gt;&gt; So what you pushing in the future, it's going to be a past. Ah, I'm not going to wait for that. He's I am the God of the present time. He told Moses, you want to give them my name? Tell them I am. Not I was not I will be. I am. When I wake up in the morning, I am. When I'm driving my car, I am. I want God today. Hallelujah. Brother say you may be living in that it may be when &gt;&gt; now &gt;&gt; it's always been what &gt;&gt; that way &gt;&gt; they come and the revival is what &gt;&gt; and they don't know it &gt;&gt; and they don't know it &gt;&gt; because because folks are waiting &gt;&gt; let him finish to pray &gt;&gt; then he's going to lay hands on me &gt;&gt; and we did that to the people. So when you go to convention, everybody's just waiting for the prayer line, &gt;&gt; even those that on wheelchair are waiting for the prayer line &gt;&gt; until the sermon is finished. &gt;&gt; No. The Bible say when Paul was preaching and he looked and he saw somebody that had faith to be healed, Paul told that person, you the rise up, receive your healing. And Paul was an apostle to the Gentile. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; In this church, don't wait for the end. &gt;&gt; When they are singing, you already got it. When I'm reading the Bible, you got it. When I'm preaching, you get it. So when the sermon is finished, I'm worshiping God for what he has done for me. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That is the way it is. What &gt;&gt; today? &gt;&gt; It's always been. That is what it is. How? Now &gt;&gt; if we have only know the what &gt;&gt; the day of visitation &gt;&gt; but the day of the visitation does what &gt;&gt; goes right through &gt;&gt; and the people are looking where &gt;&gt; way over here &gt;&gt; for what &gt;&gt; something else &gt;&gt; and the first thing you know the visitation is what &gt;&gt; over &gt;&gt; and there it is &gt;&gt; because they poke a lot of stuff in your mind &gt;&gt; and then some are waiting for Los Angeles to go down &gt;&gt; brother Brandham Okay. &gt;&gt; Everything that you have need of &gt;&gt; is where? &gt;&gt; In you. &gt;&gt; And brother say, even what? &gt;&gt; The rapture. &gt;&gt; The rapture is where? &gt;&gt; Did the rapture happen? &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; But the rapture is where? &gt;&gt; So you don't worry about the rapture. &gt;&gt; You continue to live the life when the time of the rapture come. The rapture in me will meet the rapture of God. And the two rapture will meet together because the rapture will happen in it season. So since the rapture has not happened, let me take opportunity, take advantage of God now. &gt;&gt; Why am I taking adventure? Why am I taking adventure? Because the holy one have unfolded himself. &gt;&gt; Because the presence of the Lord has come down. &gt;&gt; Because the angel have trouble the water. &gt;&gt; The water is troubling. and you are talking to me here. Leave me alone. Let me jump in the water to get my healing. After I get my healing, I will talk to you about my testimony because I took advantage of my season. Let's stop here, my friend. God bless you. Let's stand right here. Oh, glory to God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We stopped somewhere, my friend. &gt;&gt; I don't even know if it's taking advantage of the season or what you going to call it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But we have not gotten to taking advantage yet. We just on the surface of it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's keep that title. Maybe next Sunday we say seizing opportunity. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Church. &gt;&gt; Get out the dreamland. &gt;&gt; God is real. &gt;&gt; God is real. &gt;&gt; The God you read in the Bible &gt;&gt; is he he's real. &gt;&gt; He's not somewhere. He's here. Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; How can you be staring at me giving you testimony all the time, brother? &gt;&gt; And you don't give your testimony. &gt;&gt; Now, you going to put your eyes on me. &gt;&gt; Like I have some type of special anointing. &gt;&gt; No, I don't want that. &gt;&gt; The anointing is in me and in you. &gt;&gt; We need to share testimonies. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; How can I sit and this one testifying and this one testifying and this one testifying and I'm sitting I say I'm waiting for the persecution to come. &gt;&gt; So when the squeeze will come, oh brother, you will watch the third pull there. &gt;&gt; Brother Brham his wife got a tumor. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; He didn't wait for the squeeze. &gt;&gt; He went to God &gt;&gt; and he spoke to God. &gt;&gt; He said, "This woman washed my clothing. She cooked for me. She did this, this, this, this." And God came down. &gt;&gt; Auntie Wright didn't wait for the persecution. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Stop limiting the holy one. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Do you think when you take the anointing today, then God uh will begin to decrease in anointing? &gt;&gt; Do you think when we go to the rapture now and the third pull is over, it's finished? &gt;&gt; It's an unlimited power. &gt;&gt; God is in season &gt;&gt; and out of season. &gt;&gt; If he came to search for the fruit out of season and they are not there, the spoken word open up. I will get to where Paul is telling the preacher. He said, &gt;&gt; Timothy, &gt;&gt; be what? &gt;&gt; Preach the word and be what? &gt;&gt; Instant. &gt;&gt; Instant when? &gt;&gt; Instant. &gt;&gt; And what? Where? Where? Why is Paul saying that? &gt;&gt; I will get to that Lord willing next Sunday. Why is Paul saying that? I have it right here. &gt;&gt; I have it right here. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. You are a gentile. &gt;&gt; You are not a Jew. &gt;&gt; You are not a Samaritan. &gt;&gt; You are a pure Gentile. And the Bible say he came to his own &gt;&gt; and his own receive him not. &gt;&gt; And the one who receive him is actually the Gentile. &gt;&gt; So you are more of a bride than the Jewish people. &gt;&gt; He's calling the people out of every tongue, every nation. Is that the Jews? &gt;&gt; No. It's after me. I'm gone. That's when he goes back to the Jews. But this is my time. &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost is not in Israel. &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost is here. &gt;&gt; When we leave, then the Holy Ghost goes to the Jews. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Let's pray. Heavenly Father, &gt;&gt; Lord, we are approaching you humbly this afternoon. Father, thanking you for your grace, &gt;&gt; for your love, &gt;&gt; for your mercy, &gt;&gt; and for everything you have been doing for us. &gt;&gt; Father, this is as far as you wanted me to go today with these thoughts, Lord. But Lord, Father, we are believing and we are confident &gt;&gt; that something was spoken that is helping your children, &gt;&gt; strengthening, healing, removing all doubt and anxiety, all type of limitation put up by preacher about your children, Father, to access their promises. Lord, if in your day of your flesh, you could extend it a door to the Gentile &gt;&gt; to provide that which they needed. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And this is not only in the New Testament, &gt;&gt; even in the Old Testament when the deliverance that was promised to Israel, &gt;&gt; to the seed of Abraham &gt;&gt; came in through Moses. Father, as they were journeying back to the promised land, &gt;&gt; yes, &gt;&gt; there was a woman in Jericho. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; She was not part of the seed of Abraham. &gt;&gt; But father, she entering &gt;&gt; into the commonwealth of Israel when it was not her season. &gt;&gt; She was living into a different place where the place was condemned by the angel of the Lord &gt;&gt; for complete and total destruction. But a woman who knew how to seize the opportunity. &gt;&gt; When she saw the spies, &gt;&gt; when everybody else was looking and say, "Who are these people, she look at them as the only hope she can get out of Jericho." &gt;&gt; Father, she sees her opportunity and that opportunity save her and save her entire family. Father, these are the type of the women that you brought in &gt;&gt; from the Old Testament all the way to the New Testament. And you testify yourself that that type of faith is only found into the Gentiles. Lord, may you awaken us. &gt;&gt; May those that are procrastinating, may those that have been touched or affected by this spirit of laziness, &gt;&gt; of being slagger, &gt;&gt; of now being diligent, &gt;&gt; Father, release them this morning. &gt;&gt; Free them completely. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Father, may you wake them up, Lord. &gt;&gt; And may they wake up to the season &gt;&gt; and seize the opportunity &gt;&gt; and come out, Lord. Father and be free, Lord. Father, we are committing this entire day unto their hand and the oncoming week unto their hand. May your blood continue to protect us. May you strengthen us, Lord. Father, we thank you for touching those that were sick. &gt;&gt; For strengthening my body, Lord, for giving answer to those that need it, Lord. Father, be with us as we commit it all unto the hand in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; God bless you, church. We love you. [Applause] Hallelujah.
