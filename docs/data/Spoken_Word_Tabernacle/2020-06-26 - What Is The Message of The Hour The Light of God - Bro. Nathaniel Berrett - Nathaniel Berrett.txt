our midst Lord God we just don't want to invite you but we want to make you welcome father and as we're coming to this sacred moment Lord we ask humbly Lord that you do as you did after your resurrection that vindicated and proved that it was you Lord you took the bread of life and you come by the breaking of the bread Lord the disciples knew that wish you father and Lord has the two disciples that were bewildered Lord confused perplexed Lord on the way to Emmaus how you've stepped in in your grace and your mercy Lord from the roadside and Lord you spoke to them you open their understanding to the scriptures that they might recognize the day in the hour that they're in and may you do so this morning father for I can't open the scriptures and of us can open the scriptures but only you the revealer of the secrets father can open the scriptures Lord we commit this service into your hands in Jesus name we pray amen amen the sound all right sounds good up here there's a little bit of an echo but we'll deal with it praise the Lord do you commend your hands to praise the Lord amen in other words are you is the Spirit of God in your life strong enough to bring your flesh subject to the word amen praise God you know for the Prophet said that this flesh will always be sticky a man it'll get tired it'll get a little bit a little bit fussy maybe and all these different things that we've gotta bring a subject to the Spirit of God and subject to the chapter 1 we're gonna we're gonna read three portions of scripture I'm not in a hurry but I'm not gonna take too long as we announce will it will have a an extra sort service and then we'll go into and more of a church meeting type setting and but we do want to give preeminence through the Word of God a man how many wants to hear from God a man is that your attitude Amen because remember the prophecy is that you you you know you get what you expect amen and if you're expecting to hear from God you know if Balaam was expected to hear from God God spoke through the donkey amen but he wasn't expecting and he missed the Word of God amen and so I'm not a donkey but you know God can still give you heart's desire no matter what Amen the children of Israel needed water and God provided them water out of the rock game and he's supernatural there's an old limits to God him and we limit to him and of unbelief isn't hinder God it only hinders the unbeliever amen so let's just take all the unbelief out let's just take all the flesh our fleshly mentality out let's take everything out and allow the Lord God to speak to us amen and I'm not here to speak to your carnal mind I'm not here to speak boy man and may God help us the Word of God can penetrate your soul and place you I'm not worried about our circumstances going around us I'm worried about the rap dream and I'm worried about the headstone I'm worried about Christ the word of God amen so that's my duty as a minute this hour of this gospel is to place you your soul in the rapture amen and if you're truly predestinated for the rapture you'll believe it and you'll march toward Zion amen and you can have the testimony of Jesus Christ and the scripture said that the testimony of Jesus Christ is the spirit of prophecy amen and we can talk about the testimony of Jesus Christ you know Jesus Christ testify and he said I am the resurrection and the life I am that I am I mean all these things he identified himself by the scripture and that became his testimony amen now what about you is that your testimony have you identified yourself by the scripture have you allowed the opening of the word to reveal to you who you are in this day can you say I am the rapture Amen I am the resurrection I am The Bride of Christ she is him amen is that your testimony without me there could be no rapture amen without you if that's your testimony there could be no rapture I am the rapture I am the fulfillment of that scripture that future was rid of me amen low in the volume of the book I have seen it is raining on me here I come to do that wheel Oh Lord amen and we submit ourselves to the Word of God and the Word of God does its work in our life amen amen it sounded pretty good there for a while now it's kind of going all over the place but we'll we'll plow through it so st. John chapter 1 verse wanting want to greet everybody that's still on the hook-up streaming the service this morning Madonna virtually Brett bless you we trust him and pray that the service has been a blessing to you so far and that the Word of God will minister to your heart say ma'am God is omnipotent he's no respecter of person or respected distances and he can he can fill those with the Holy Ghost they're on the hook-up as much as he can here amen so we love him we love everybody want to greet you in the name of Jesus Christ and we just want to give preeminence to the word here just for a few minutes I don't have too much I'll try not to be two scattered and would just plow in trust that God will bring the the increase ain't man alright I think that sounds good that sound good to y'all alright we'll work with that okay so the scripture says very familiar reading and I love that I love the writings of John in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God the same was in the beginning with God is that better it's better for me alright praise the Lord st. John chapter one verse one in the very very familiar scripture very powerful reading in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God the same was in the beginning with God all things were made by him and without him the word was not anything made that was made in him the word was life amen he was the source of life we're not just talking about botany life or natural life life it's excuse me in him was life verse four and the life was the light of man think about that now focusing on that light we're gonna be speaking on continuing on what is the message of the hour but for a subtitle the light of God okay all right few more verses in him was life and the life was the light of men the light shining in darkness in the darkness comprehended or not verse 6 there was a man sent from God whose name was John the same came for a witness to bear witness of the light a tall man through him might believe amen you may be seated how many father local prayed your blessings to the reading of the word in Jesus name we pray and we'll turn quick to John 17 but you notice here you know as our subtitle is the light of God what is the message of the hour a subtitle the light of God and you know it says here in verse 6 well let me back up real quick so in verse 4 in him was life and the life was the light of men think about that so what God has given you to bring to be light to you is the life of God his life in him was life and that life is the light of men so when the scripture says rise and shine for thy light has come it could be nothing else than the light of God which is also the life of of men praise God now John John's Commission and I like that you can see the Eagle anointing here upon John the Apostle John how he's riding right he didn't just he didn't write all about the natural and about you know how tall the Lord Jesus was in the flesh and what he looked like and all these characteristics he wasn't so much worried about the aspect of John introducing the man Christ Jesus right because there was a hundreds and thousands of people we can say that saw the man seen the man and they recognized him to be you know so high and so quick so color hair and so color eyes and so on and so forth but John wasn't look judging after the flesh the Eagle anointing upon him realized that even though John did introduce the man Christ Jesus but more importantly that the thing that was the concept the thing that God was trying to get across was the light amen and that's that was the vindication that John was a true prophet of God anybody could have said oh look there there's a there's a middle-aged man that's probably the Messiah but no he recognizes remember the Spirit of God I said the one whom you seen the light descending up and remaining upon that is the Messiah and so John was commissioned to recognize that light and then to introduce that light amen praise God and so you know John he didn't have any miracles there was no signs and wonders that John could say hey this vindicates me so John wasn't vindicated by signs and wonders by miracles but he was vindicated by his ability to identify the light amen and so people heard the Lord Jesus preaching they heard him teaching but they could not see the light and so was it in this hour that's the prophet of God's duty is to introduce us to the light amen the light of this hour amen and so without that without seeing that light you're lost without seeing that light there's no redemption for you without seeing that light there is no rapture for you so you can you can read all the books you want you can listen to all the tapes you want you can read every verse in the Bible and have every person memorize but without coming in contact with that light there is no life for you amen and that is the core that is the message itself is the light of God for this hour amen and without that you're lost without that you're in darkness and heading towards the Tribulation Period amen and I found they were striking when we were listening to that tape this morning as it was playing you know brother Baylor made reference reference that the builders had lost the headstone how embarrassing amen the builders that are supposed to be instructed in the house of God how the house is supposed to be built the contractors are professionals those that are supposed to be able to read the blueprints they lost the headstone and so as in this message am I'm fully persuaded that the majority of the builders in this message have lost the headstone even though the Prophet introduced us to the headstone they've lost it they focus on everything else they focus on the mechanics they focused on on on the do's and don'ts and their legalism and all this other nonsense but they folk they have lost the best stone there was no headstone there's no rapture with no headstone there's no redemption with no headstone there's no redemption for you a man with no headstone there's the Tribulation Period a man at best producing tribulation Saints good tribulation Saints that are to have a holy conviction of the Word of God and are not willing to accept the mark of the beast a man just like the Jews that gave their life some of this back there under the World War 2 and all that amen but we've got to watch that light and when the prophet of God said I'm watching for that light to come down in a meeting a man we've got to find that light we've got to strike that tip is in vain all of our efforts are in vain think about that a man we're in a serious hour a very serious hour we've got to have that light we've got to come to contact with it something to change us a man from a church member from a carnal cane like spirit a religious attitude a fighter a man to a redeemed son and daughter of God coming in contact with the headstone the prophet of God said and you know as we move on further and further into the bride age further and further into the headstone age a man the two are becoming one the intelligence of Christ in the bride a man and you know one of these days we won't have to read scriptures all the time one of these days when when the Word of God is coming forth they won't have to be backed up with a quote just to convince for carnal mind no we'll all be in one heart in one mind and one accord the intelligence of Christ flowing freely through the body amen what will will will be traveling a thought then praise God I'm looking forward to that our a man and it's right upon us it's not around the corner it's not a far off amen now hey man you're not gonna be any more closer to God than your right now amen we got to ask God to help us help us help us help us help us amen praise God so let's see here we're doing good let's see Saint John chapter 17 Amen everybody happy happy in the Lord anyhow praise the Lord praise the Lord praise Lauren st. John chapter 17 so you know this was a little bit of a struggle for me I you know I try to you know you kind of want to take your time and dig real real deep but I'm not gonna be able to dig real deep so I'm just gonna hit the highlights and y'all can can and can can pray and maybe dig down into it a little bit more but y'all would know where I'm coming from so Saint John chapter 17 again what is the message of the hour the light of God amen the light of God the prophet of God introduced us to the light amen the light of this hour the light of the coming of the Lord the light of the headstone the light of redemption the light of the rafter the light of resurrection power the light of the bride age' light of the coming of Christ that's the hour that we're living in the bride coming of Christ where she used to come to maturity amen and manifest all that Christ was all that the father was reporting the Christ all that crisis he pours into the bride a man and a man and a man let's listen let's read this st. John 17 verses 1 amen these words spake Jesus and lifted up his heart lifted up to heaven heavenly places in Christ Jesus a man not worried about all these natural communistic inspired things going on around this we got a worry up keep our eyes on the headstone we don't want to lose track of the headstone amen because there would just be a headless something running around not knowing what's going on amen amen but the prophet of god introduced us to the headstone say ma'am but with it we've got resurrection power rapturing faith no worries a man we're gonna overcome death death shall be swallowed up a victory amen all right Oh then Jesus lifted up his eyes to heaven and said father the hour is come glorify thy son that thy son also may glorify thee think about that a redeemed Son of God or Jesus Christ the perfect son of God on earth recognizing what our it is amen why because he had the mind of God amen he said I the father worker that I work in here the to a man is it possible the bride of Jesus Christ can recognize the hour we're in amen the door of the Gentiles closing Amen de the prophet of God said when the door of the Gentiles closed God will anoint the church amen are we in that hour that thy son also may glorify thee so Jesus is asking glorify thy son how powerfully men glorify thy son a man I'm not worried about having a new house a new car and new this or a new that I'm worried about the same glory that's mine that's my inheritance being endowed and coming upon me and me stepping into that that I might glorify my bridegroom amen father the hours come has the hour comptuer CH that the bride can be glorified a ma'am father the hour has come glorify thy son that thy son also may glorify thee as thou has given him power over all flesh that he should give eternal life to as many as thou has given him and this is life eternal that they might know thee the only true God and Jesus Christ whom thou has seen a man I would love to break down into that I'm not sure if we're gonna have time but that is eternal life that they might know thee the father and the son amen they might know the father and the lo gosh they might know the father the the self-existing one the one with with all the attributes contained within them that they might know thee and the expressed attributes praise God keep that in mind the father and the son the thoughts and the expression in the on unrevealed still veiled and then the logos the expression of the thoughts which is the light the logos is the light and the light hello is your life the expression of God is the message of the hour praise God not books tapes not carnality not do's and don'ts not legalism not so much dressing and all this other nonsense sorry I shouldn't say nonsense but all these other you know all these other things that go along with that amen it is the express thoughts of Almighty God amen the light of God and this is eternal life that they might know thee the only true God and Jesus Christ whom thou has sent I have glorified beyond the earth I have finished the work which thou gave us me to do and now O Father thou an our Father glorify thou me with thine own self praise God think about that that's where the scripture says that Christ thought it not let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus that Christ Jesus not thought it not to be Robert II make himself equal with God let that mind being you think about that now O Father glorify thou me with thine own self with the glory which I had with thee before the world was praise God you know Jesus recognized that he was with the father before the foundation of the world and brother Branham said that you know of course Jesus the logos being the first one to come out of God the first which was the entire attribute of God expressed in somewhat of a tangible form right the the complete concept of God expressed and brother BAM said that down that we didn't come that way see Jesus came from the thought to the theophany and then to flesh so we bypass that we who know the thoughts of God were still the thoughts of God concerning us up to the time of this message were unexpressed the they were sealed the names in the Lamb's Book of Life was sealed nobody knew anything about it they were never been expressed but yeah so we come through carnality through sin through the womb of a woman unexpressed we come here in the body of this sinful flesh unexpressed to our true DNA are true attribute of God of who we are has not been expressed yet and so but yet Jesus he was from the thought to the expression and then to the word unto the flesh body where the map said we we bypassed that we're coming from the thought well the thought of God being revealed expressed is entering our mortal body amen through this hour of redemption so it's manifesting time its expression time so Jesus is saying glorify me with the glory that I had with thee before the world was alright now let's turn to the second the 22nd verse of that same chapter Jesus is saying and the glory which thou gavest me I have given them that they may be one even as we are one isn't that something praise God you know Jesus said the glory even had the same glory that you endowed me with before the foundation of the world I'm asking you to glorify that with me now and not only that I'm also giving it to them and then though they may be one you know kind of like we're one you know no no he said that they may be one as we are one and Jesus said when you see me you've seen the father the father worketh and I work at hitherto amen so he's saying that I the same glory that you've given me I have given them that they may be one as we are one a man that we can say as you see me you see Christ I am the fullness of the Godhead body I am the manifested Word of God I am at the rapture I am the resurrection and the life praise God because it is my inheritance I have been glorified I have been redeemed think about that strong meat amen be longer to them that are of full age that have their senses exercised by reason of use to discern between good and evil to discern between the two spirits working within the framework of the church amen and so Jesus saying that the same glory that you've given me I'm giving in and they may be one as we are one isn't that something powerful you the proper God said that to all that God was all tell him was he poured into crimes all that Christ was he poured into the bride amen how do you all a part of the bride right amen I am my father are one praise God you know where it's manifesting time a man it's an hour where the varieties that come to maturity the door of the Gentile is closing we've got to recognize where we are a man and being step with the light first John chapter one praise the Lord first John chapter one that which was from the beginning which we have heard which we have seen with our eyes which we have looked upon and our hands have handled of the word of life John was a witness of it he had heard the word of life for the life was manifested and we have seen it and bear witness and show unto you that eternal life which was with the father and was manifested unto us amen so that eternal life which was with the father before the foundation of the world John was a witness of it he was a recipient of it and because he was a recipient of it he could turn around and share it with you amen and that's what our that's where our fellowship is in that's where our fellowship is in email that which we have seen and heard declare we unto you that ye also may have fellowship with us to fellows in one ship going the same direction amen praise God and surely our Fellowship is with the father and with his son Jesus Christ surely our Fellowship is with the pro generator truly our Fellowship is with the creator's truly our Fellowship is with the UH the the the unseen God and him who he has expressed and the expression of him a man truly we've been connected to the thoughts of Elohim and we've been a part of the expression praise God Amen I just explained everything I wanted to explain alright and these things right we unto you that what your joy may be full how many has their joyful Amen if you don't have your joyful then I I suggest that you get into that your joy may be full hallelujah this then is the message which we have heard of him and declare it to you that God is light that's the message of the hour and if you're not preaching that you're not preaching Christ amen and in him is no darkness at all if we say then that we have fellowship with him and walk in darkness we lie and do not the truth but if we walk in the light as he is in the light we have fellowship one with the other and the blood of Jesus Christ His Son cleanses us from all sin hallelujah praise God so let's go back here to st. John chapter one verse one real quick you know brother Branham explains it like this and if the Lord will help me all I'll pick up and kind of and continue with the thought that the Prophet is is is portraying here so in the message is the unveiling of God where the RAM says here this is a part of his way this is the way that he manifests himself to us manifests the Eternal Word God Jehovah made flesh like in Saint John one in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and in the beginning was Elohim so the prophet of God again is like the Prophet said the thought runs deeper than the word so he's getting down into the thought and you know as a young man and in the message I used to get confused all the times because you know I would hear brother Branham say Elohim it's here you know talking about LEM coming and then Michael coming and then and then El Shaddai and then Jehovah and and then Christ and then Michael and gate you know all these different things and I'm well which one is it you know where we are amen but the prophets come to find out the fullness of the Godhead bodily is here think about that no wonder the Satan is screaming and howling ain't fighting for all he can to keep you from recognizing that light because that light is your life he's fighting to keep you from that life fighting to keep you from Redemption he's fighting to keep you from thereafter he's fighting of your predestinated position out of out of being a squatter in your inheritance out of being a squatter and your rights he's fighting to keep this revelation from you amen with Hollywood with all these all this nonsense of the world the Tribulation Period is right upon us and some of us sleep like like you know like we've got a bunch of Devils this rocking us to sleep amen a bunch of Hollywood worldly Devils we got to shake ourselves we're in a battle a resurrection battle Mount Zion battle RAF during battle a Redemption battle hallelujah amen the kingdom of God must be pressed into yes or you got to take this sword of the Lord and fight shop every devil out of the way shop every hindering spirit chop every carnality shop every Dogma chop every Creed chop everything that's contrary to this light chop everything everything contrary to this light is your enemy just like Peter telling our Lord when our Lord was declaring the light when our Lord was declaring the word for his hour how he must go up to be crucified Peter got in the flesh I said not so Lord Jesus said get behind me Satan get behind me Satan can you recognize when Satan speaks can you recognize when he's trying to motivate you against the Word of God can you recognize when he's hindering and casting a shadow upon your life upon the light of this hour can you recognize that rebuking get it out of the way we're in a battle we're in the evening time we're in the last hours of the last day the Gentile days are closing the sword of the Lord is here bring in the kingdom of God to deliver you to positionally place you in another Ephesians 2 positionally place you in the body of Christ in the mind of Christ think about that can you be one actually one we're supposed to be one in the mind of Christ the body of Christ one with one another amen praise God so a man Satan is doing everything he can to prevent you from coming to this revelation the proper God said if you fail go back to this message crisis of mystery of God revealed you let everything take it away from you your job your husband your wife all these carnal things of the world Jesus for warned us and Saint Luke chapter 21 do to you know take heed of the cares of this life of eating drinking all of this all of this carousing all this type of world events take heed that those things do not overcome you they don't overwhelm you they don't distract you from the revelation of the light of God bringing brought forth in this hour and the property God said how are the people going to recognize him when he comes unless they're constantly in the word amen praise God yes sir so a man the fullness of the Godhead bodily is here amen oh my god the host of heaven Michael Gabriel Elliot and every all the attributes of God have been revealed to the bride that the bride can take on the fullest of the Godhead bodily to probably God said think about what was once a great mysterious secret in the mind of God is now in the body of Christ hallelujah what was once hidden in the mind of God that safety knew nothing about nobody knew nothing about is now in the body of Christ the fullness of God is here the mind of Christ is here the capstone is here the intelligence is here we're in the body of Christ praise God amen what was once a great mysterious secret in the mind of God is now in the body of

of the world before angels before Lucifer before anything back to the mind of God so now they're in this hour the prophet of God was not just connected with anything he went back it was connected with Elohim the Ancient of Days the Wed the wise one the ancient one the all-knowing one the eternal judge of heaven and earth the Prophet was connected to the mind of God to deliver you the Lamb's Book of Life the redemption of your of your souls man so the Prophet was connected to the mind of God he was connected to Elohim and brought you into the living image of the Living God a man when you've heard

the thought to the expression that was before he was made flesh but Satan interrupted the plan of God it was all part of the plan of God he thought he interrupted it now we're here on earth born of a woman full of all kinds of mass all kinds of hippocrates all kinds of trouble but yet we've got a predestinated seed in our soul yet unexpressed and in this hour the book has been open the seven angels brought the prophet into the mind of God and ulo him from before the foundation of the world and picked up those attributes and now they're being expressed from Elohim to the logos in there now you praise God the expression of the bride of Jesus Christ past the light of the shower brother Stephens telling me to slow down all right we're gonna we're gonna do the best we can praise God so in the beginning uh what the Word was with God and who heard and in the beginning was Elohim and Elohim was became the word and the word was Elohim and the word was made Elohim and he goes on to say see nothing's out of order it's just Elohim materializing amen from Genesis to Revelation it's Elohim unfolding himself Elohim what is Elohim like I said the Father the Pro generator the creator the one in whom all the seeds come from the one that has uh of the self existing one the one that was unexpressed amen and now the fullness of his expressions are coming forth yes sir so go st. John chapter one in the beginning was the word that's the logos in the beginning was the logos in the beginning what is the logos a thought expressed is a word in the beginning was the expression of God stopped in the beginning before the beginning okay before the beginning there was the thought of God unexpressed their self existing one but since the beginning the thoughts of God were expressed in the first son the first expression which was God Almighty the fullness of God expressed in a theophany Jesus Christ so in the beginning was the expression of God and the expression of God was with Elohim and the expression of God was Elohim amen so I got the quote right here I have time to read it but brother Graham said that let me just admit me let me just read this one particular quote here then out of God or out of Elohim oh say came the logos out of Elohim out of the unexpressed came the expressed which we would say is like a little sacred light moved out of the darkness or out of eternity I hope you guys are listening see that light came out of eternity and that's when the beginning begun began a ma'am and now the prophet of God and now the scripture says in this hour Jesus reveals himself as the beginning of the creation of God Angie tempura brother BAM said it has to do with another creation he is creating himself his bride this is the the work of the Lord creating himself his body and sober have said that those seven angels came forth out of eternity and so here we are out of eternity in the beginning is the creation of God in this hour expressing the thoughts of Elohim that they might be materialized in your mortal beings hallelujah and safety can't do nothing about it any man the squatter has finished the accuser of the brethren is cast down why because we've been fully redeemed by the abstract title deed which is now in our hand now in the bright hand now in the body of Christ the property god said when that when when Adam lost the title deed it couldn't go back to Adam it couldn't go back to the dirty hands of Satan where did it go - ello him why because it hadn't been expressed yet Adam had the title deed Adam had the book of redemption but none of it had been expressed yet Satan couldn't hold that filthy thing with all of his unbelief and lust and and and jealousy and all this nonsense no and went back to the mind of God concealed never to be revealed until the end time and the prophet of God met that light the prophet of God the angels of God connected the one like unto the Son of Man with Elohim the Ancient of Days and and the book was unfolded amen the book was open praise God the beginning of the kingdom of God being ushered in hallelujah yes sir so brother Graham says that from Elohim came to logos and from logos came the man a man do y'all realize that y'all that's the process of the birth of a son of God or a daughter of God you're no longer the son or daughter of your earthly parent amen you come forth from the loins of Elohim through what through the expression of the word through the expression of the word through the light the bread Brooke the Bible says whatsoever makes manifest is light the property God said what is light it's the spoken word of God made manifest so in this hour the prophet of God connects to the mind of Elohim the Elohim though the boss of God dropping the Prophet each angel every night revealing a seal revealing the thunders the whole nine yards what do they do expresses the word expresses the logos and now from that sons and daughters of God are born in this hour of creation amen the begin the creation of God this is another creation this is a special designation of himself just as the Holy Spirit overshadowed in the womb of Mary the logos the expressed word of this hour things that have never been heard things that have never been spoken things that have never been entering into the hearts of man until this hour amen the work of redemption what was once quads great secret in his mind is now in the body of Christ hallelujah let the expression of yourself amen can you say I and my father are one I am my bridegroom are one rejoice for the marriage of the lamb has come and his bride hath made herself ready it was John's job to identify that light descending and remaining upon the Lamb of God but in this hour the prophet of God seen that light descending and remaining upon not the lamb but the Lambs wife the Bride of Christ she is to come on the scene in this hour the move is on for the bride thus saith the Lord amen the move is on for the bride her identification is here what are the opening of the seven seals floor at the 11th hour Gentile workers might receive their inheritance amen that's thus saith the Lord that's the scripture that's the light of this hour where are you are you headed for a Tribulation Period are you caught up in all this nonsense in the world are you in love with Jesus Christ are you fellowshipping with elohim and the logos are you fellowshipping with the attributes of God in the expression of those attributes are you Fellowship in with the light of this hour amen that the blood of Jesus Christ can cleanse you from all unrighteousness outside of that you're a church member outside of that you're in idolatry and the majority of the like I said the majority of the folks in the message have lost the headstone it's that way it's always in the minority they've lost the headstone they focus on everything else they focus on all like I said that the framework of it the simulants of it the the outworking of it but they have missed that light and like I said that best they're producing tribulations things but it takes the Word of God the light of God to produce rapturing Saints mmm praise God now let's take a breath take a deep breath everybody all right what is like the vindicated spoken word of God I'll try to that there's no light see you can't lighten the world with flashlights so a man-made idea you can't lighten the world with that no sir it just cast shadows and makes confusion and everything else it takes God's Word that's manifest the Esso in the Sun Amen that's why the scripture said he's spoken unto us but in this last day by his son by the manifested word that word comes through the prophets that word comes to the bride that word comes to apostles whatever it is it's all the Word of God the bride of Jesus Christ speaking by the son a man the expression of God if we could stop here for a moment if it would be possible and think of that tonight of the message of the hour the express thoughts of Jehovah and that's the message of the hour the expressed thoughts of Jehovah hallelujah before listen mediately where he connects that to you he doesn't just go like st. John this there's not any other he connects it before the foundation of the world we are told our names are put on the Lamb's Book of Life a ma'am so that's the express thoughts of Jehovah the property God is talking about we know what we can say it's st. Luke 1730 Malachi 4 revelations 10 relations you know all these different scriptures but yeah it's also the names that God put what was written in the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world the expression of Jehovah a man that's to bring rapturing faith to the bride of Jesus Christ amen where the RAM says here as I've already mentioned in other words Adam the first man and the lower creations of God the first creation was God himself then out of God came the logo so he's saying the first creation was God creating himself in a body the logos was what which was the son of God then out of the logos which was the word and the word was made flesh into what among us and out of the logos came forth the man and it's the same thing that was God's Way of creating a son of God at the beginning and eye upon that upon creating that son that son had received the book of life the title deed to the earth but we know Satan came in and spoiled the plans so he thought and that caused the fall that caused those names to not be expressed the title deed went back to the mind of Jehovah concealed still still sealed with seven seals never opened and in this hour there was only was one that was worthy the Lamb of God he paid the price of a Redemption and endued and in the fullness of time a man those names have been expressed the prophet of God said see it comes from the mind of God Elohim he says he comes forth from eternity those names the Lamb of the book of redemption to Christ to the seventh angel and then the seventh angel does what hands it out to the bride a mem so we've got ell him the logos and then their sons and daughters God being born again by the Lamb's Book of Life how do we you're the light of God that's the message of the hour that's the message over the hour is the light of God that's when all hell turn loose amen demons begin screaming in the image and that certainly worked I woke Satan up amen 200 million demons amen coming against the bride to keep you from that revelation to keep you from that but there's more with us than there is with them the same ones that kick them out in the beginning are with us Michael and Gabriel Elohim we have the fullness of heaven the hosts of heaven a man on our side Bryan amen praise God recognize the light a man step into that light it is your inheritance a man can you say glorify thou me with the glory I had with you before the world was a man glorify thou me with that which I was supposed to have now I'm receiving it amen praise God amen what was once in the mind of God a great mysterious secret is now in the Bride of Christ I just love saying that praise God now listen to this this is my last cult and we'll close we've got plenty of time three more minutes just as we know listen Weber I'm saying here as a man asked me a few moments ago about the coming and the rapture we know we live the time out at the time of the at the time of the rapture is at hand and we're looking for a rapturing faith that can pull the church together and give it some supernatural strength and the property glass Center the third seal he says you don't see something has got to happen to change this church you know up to that time they had just had Creed's and all this carnality and all this a dead word and everything else like that but he said he's got to have something to wake the church it'll take the seven thunders to awake the church to give the bride the rapturing faith proper said the opening of the seven seals is the seven thunders all this stuff so it's gonna take that to give the bride the rapturing faith a man so some supernatural strength that can change these bodies that we live in when we see a God that can raise the dead off the floor out out of the yard and bring them back in life again a breeze in them before us when we see a God that can take the cancer that's eating man to a shadow and raise him to be a stronger man that ought to give wrath drink faith to the people but still it's got to be more than that a man because that was in the second poll but brother BAM said the spirit spoke and said the third poll will be the thing that catches the bride the rainbow trout for the rapture we know a man yes sir and what is the third poll of the opening of the word what is the opening of the word the expression of Elohim the logos bringing you your light rise and shine for thy light has come and the glory of the Lord is what risen upon me how do you praise God first and second coming a mem all right so listen to what he says here all right so strong man I oughta give us an afternoon faith that in that light flashes from the sky and the trumpet sounds the body of Christ will be quickly gathered together and change in a moment and are tinkling in a moment and taken into the heavens yes there's got to be something like that happen in our schools a theology can never produce that yet they intellectually are all right but you've got to meet that light you've got to find that something you've got to meet that light and that light is the little book in the Angels hand that was minister to the Prophet and the Commission was image for you for the bride John representing the bride to eat the book amen and so we've got to meet that light for the men were also caught in one place a light of deliverance you know Moses tried to introduction he conquer the children of Israel a man and he missed the mark but when he met the pillar fire immediately when he met the expression of God for the hour the logos he met the light in that instilled in him and complete redemption the marriage of the light the marriage of the lamb has come and his what bride has made herself ready the prophet god said all the material that we need for the wedding garment is on the earth now yes sir hallelujah the righteousness of the saints is here the glory of God is here to react sure you to quicken your body and when the light of God has come to surround
