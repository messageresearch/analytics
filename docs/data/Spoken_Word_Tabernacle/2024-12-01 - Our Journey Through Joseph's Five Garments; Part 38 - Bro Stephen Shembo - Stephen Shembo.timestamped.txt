[53:27] and we reading our Bible twice a day one
[53:30] chapter in the morning one chapter
[53:32] before you go to bed if you don't I will
[53:34] call Brother Mickey and he will talk to
[53:36] you about it amen then uh we are reading
[53:39] our cood our church ages 70 weeks of
[53:43] Daniel the Seal's adoption or somebody
[53:47] is listening to the message of the hour
[53:49] amen you forgive me young man I will try
[53:53] the best to schedule something for you I
[53:55] don't know if it's going to happen this
[53:57] year because December is almost uh
[54:00] booked so let's see what we will do with
[54:02] the deacons so December the 7th which is
[54:05] this coming uh Saturday it's the young
[54:08] Sisters Meeting we clear on that one
[54:11] okay and then December the 14th is the
[54:15] question and answer then December the
[54:17] 21st is merried couple part four I will
[54:22] try the best I'm not anticipating a
[54:25] question and answer you put your
[54:27] question in the box and as we developing
[54:29] the subject we are automatically
[54:32] answering your question this is the one
[54:34] time you don't put your name so you can
[54:36] put your question there and we will deal
[54:38] with it so I will see how far we will go
[54:41] with what we have remaining if not we
[54:43] might have to continue until we make
[54:45] sure no stone is left unturned so we
[54:49] don't come up with any question
[54:51] everything is clear because it's such a
[54:53] tremendous subject that need to be dealt
[54:55] with especially in the message of the
[54:58] hour so the 31st will be a Tuesday just
[55:02] like we have Thanksgiving on a Tuesday
[55:05] so Lord's willing that will be the New
[55:07] Year's Eve so we will have service on
[55:10] Tuesday the December the
[55:12] 31st so I will talk to the Deacon and we
[55:15] will give you the time it's not going to
[55:17] be 7:00 we will push it up because we
[55:19] have to go all the way to midnight but
[55:21] at least you heard me December the 31st
[55:24] that is our uh New Year's Eve so on
[55:28] Wednesday which is going to be January
[55:30] 1st we not going to give service
[55:32] everybody heard me so far amen I met
[55:35] with an elder recently uh the one uh
[55:38] from the Congo and uh brother kumu he
[55:41] didn't have a chance to preach for us
[55:43] but when we talked with him on the phone
[55:45] yesterday he said please greet the
[55:47] church for me so brother cumu if you
[55:50] hear this a thought spoken word
[55:52] Tabernacle that you greeted them in the
[55:55] name of the Lord Jesus Christ so can you
[55:57] reply so he he can hear you
[56:02] okay so brother Kumo whenever you hear
[56:06] this you just know I pass on to your
[56:08] message he's a he's a great a great
[56:11] tremendous Elder that I knew back home
[56:14] but I never get a chance to meet him
[56:16] face to face you only see him far away
[56:19] back home churches are really really big
[56:21] like 7,000 people and things like that
[56:24] so you far away and amen are coming from
[56:27] the corner so you see the preacher way
[56:29] small like this so by God's grace we had
[56:32] a chance to talk to him and to
[56:34] fellowship and everything went well amen
[56:37] amen amen amen Oh Glory to God you might
[56:42] I just have to explain this so at least
[56:44] you have an answer for
[56:46] this I do not have a quote for
[56:49] it but I did it in response to a request
[56:54] the way I preach preach I I usually
[56:59] engage my
[57:02] audience you already know what I'm
[57:04] saying so meaning when I'm talking I'm
[57:07] waiting for a
[57:09] feedback we are not
[57:11] Catholics where the priest have uh a
[57:14] certain book and the congregation
[57:16] doesn't have it and I praise God that he
[57:19] put me in the age that we can project
[57:22] the
[57:24] court so see the old church I always
[57:27] preach with the screen and the main
[57:30] thing that I want about the screen is I
[57:32] want to project the code so that what I
[57:35] read you read it with me when I talk to
[57:39] people I tell them bring your Bible so
[57:42] when I'm reading the Bible don't look at
[57:44] me look at the Bible so me and you we
[57:46] make sure we reading the same thing so
[57:49] when you leave this building you never
[57:51] use my name you say the Bible say or
[57:54] brother Bram say amen that's the reason
[57:58] so sometime when I read in question and
[58:00] answer in church I usually read one
[58:02] portion and I let you read the other one
[58:05] so I make sure we are all engaged
[58:07] because we're preaching together so
[58:09] sometime I can read the quot here I will
[58:12] read a portion and I'm expecting you to
[58:14] read another portion of the code amen
[58:17] but sometime you don't do it or sometime
[58:20] your voices are very low very so whoever
[58:23] goes back and uh listen to the sermon
[58:26] again my microphone goes straight in the
[58:29] streaming right but your voice is not
[58:32] really captured in the streaming that's
[58:34] right so if I'm reading Jesus Christ if
[58:37] I read Jesus it's clear on the recording
[58:40] right but when you say Christ it is not
[58:43] really clear on the so whoever is
[58:46] listening is missing certain portion
[58:49] right and because of that somebody ask a
[58:52] question I mean request he say brother
[58:53] Steven can you get the microphone to
[58:56] somebody yeah so that when the
[58:59] congregation is reading that person is
[59:03] representing I have to explain this so
[59:06] next time you know if somebody ask you
[59:09] where is the cat uh-uh you know why I'm
[59:11] doing this are we together are we
[59:15] together so that person usually it's
[59:17] brother Angelo and brother Benjamin so
[59:20] those person are actually representing
[59:23] you they're using the microphone so that
[59:26] your portion is heard on the tape on the
[59:31] recording so when you are home even if
[59:34] you sleeping you don't watch but you can
[59:36] hear the quot in it entirety because if
[59:40] you're driving and you're listening you
[59:41] cannot be watching to see exactly what
[59:44] you're missing so it's not that I have a
[59:47] coat I'm doing that so that your portion
[59:51] of the recording comes
[59:53] into the table so that we can continue
[59:56] to have uh like uh a continuity
[1:00:00] everything is clear of the court whether
[1:00:02] you sleeping or whether you working you
[1:00:04] put an iPad and you listen to the sermon
[1:00:07] at least brother Steven doesn't cut it
[1:00:09] off like I'm reading one and the
[1:00:10] congregation is reading one no we
[1:00:12] reading together amen so these here are
[1:00:16] your voices amen if you want to push me
[1:00:20] toward the court brother brandham
[1:00:21] sometime we ask the congregation I want
[1:00:23] you to hold amen so that the people on
[1:00:25] the tape will know that you you say
[1:00:28] something amen so the purpose that I'm
[1:00:31] doing this is just to make sure that I
[1:00:35] don't leave anything left alone because
[1:00:38] the way I preach if I read a portion I'm
[1:00:40] expecting you to read a portion so we
[1:00:43] can work together that's right amen the
[1:00:45] gift of teaching that's the way he works
[1:00:48] in my
[1:00:49] life amen amen so if you don't say amen
[1:00:54] and they say Amen in my ear I'm moving
[1:00:56] on because they are saying amen for
[1:01:00] you we clear now you got an answer now
[1:01:04] we clear now blessed be the name of the
[1:01:07] Lord that's those are certain things we
[1:01:09] need to clarify because somebody might
[1:01:11] ask a question why is why is he doing
[1:01:14] this or this or this no no no no this
[1:01:16] that's the reason why we're doing that
[1:01:18] we clear so far and I'm going to explain
[1:01:21] the second thing because I felt it
[1:01:23] pressing into me amen amen
[1:01:26] in the message the word Bishop is in the
[1:01:33] Bible the word Bishop is in the Bible
[1:01:36] the word Bishop is in the message but
[1:01:39] the way it's
[1:01:42] applied this is where the problem
[1:01:45] is would you give me some
[1:01:48] time so do me a favor technician keep
[1:01:51] dislike on a Tik Tok yeah H so whenever
[1:01:55] in the future somebody ask you a
[1:01:57] question just give them the link this is
[1:01:59] where our pastor responded to this are
[1:02:03] we together can I say it okay what does
[1:02:07] a bishop
[1:02:09] mean in this message when we say Bishop
[1:02:12] it means what it means what amen I'm
[1:02:15] going to use an example in this church
[1:02:17] brother Charles thir he's back there he
[1:02:21] he start preaching in this
[1:02:23] church are we together brother Ben start
[1:02:26] preaching in this church brother de M
[1:02:30] start preaching in this church and they
[1:02:32] will begin to grow in their Ministries
[1:02:35] and Lord's willing later on they might
[1:02:37] be invited to a church or a conference
[1:02:40] or overseas and they will be going back
[1:02:43] and forth and preaching and if the Lord
[1:02:45] Terry I don't know maybe one of them may
[1:02:48] end up being a pastor somewhere amen for
[1:02:52] those three I'm just using those three
[1:02:54] so you understand so it's very very easy
[1:02:56] because we also have brother poop and
[1:02:59] brother uh Glen Kelly I'm not ignoring
[1:03:01] them I just want to nail the devil
[1:03:03] everywhere amen I'm just using the the
[1:03:06] younger on so you understand what I'm
[1:03:08] trying to say so if so as they grow
[1:03:12] according to the message I am their
[1:03:15] Bishop that's right that's right in
[1:03:17] other word they were birth under the
[1:03:20] ministry of God that he plac in my life
[1:03:26] whoever is in the sister church and that
[1:03:29] start preaching in that sister church
[1:03:32] that Pastor is their Bishop but that
[1:03:35] Bishop is not a Catholic
[1:03:39] bishop it just means that they were
[1:03:42] birth under my Ministry they can consult
[1:03:46] me if they have any question but if they
[1:03:49] don't have any question they don't need
[1:03:51] to consult me if they Pastor somewhere I
[1:03:55] can have go to their church and begin to
[1:03:58] pressurize or control their church
[1:04:01] that's Catholicism come on now if
[1:04:04] brother Benjamin ending up somewhere
[1:04:06] being a pastor he's completely
[1:04:09] Sovereign I don't know if you okay so
[1:04:12] whatever the holy spirit will put in his
[1:04:15] heart he will preach it with full
[1:04:19] freedom I don't know if that's okay
[1:04:22] without worrying that if I say this
[1:04:25] maybe brother Steven won't like it no as
[1:04:28] long as he sees that in the Bible and in
[1:04:32] the message where the brother Steven
[1:04:34] doesn't see it yet he is free to preach
[1:04:38] it the way the Holy Spirit show him and
[1:04:42] then me and him keep
[1:04:44] Fellowship that is what a bishop
[1:04:47] mean but when a bishop begin to have
[1:04:51] control over the churches that's naden
[1:04:56] that's what the message
[1:04:59] condemn amen amen the one from whom I
[1:05:04] left amen left the
[1:05:10] message so I don't have a
[1:05:13] bishop are we together now the one who
[1:05:17] was supposed to be my Bishop left the
[1:05:19] message so I do not have a bishop but I
[1:05:24] have elders
[1:05:25] [Applause]
[1:05:29] that preach the message before me and I
[1:05:32] can consult those Elders when I have
[1:05:36] question not any
[1:05:38] Elders those that are strictly on the
[1:05:42] word it is My Prerogative to choose who
[1:05:47] I'm going to consult because some of
[1:05:49] them are not on the
[1:05:51] word but they are Elder I will respect
[1:05:54] them as Elder but when they come to the
[1:05:56] word of God I'm not going to deal with
[1:05:59] them are we together but there are
[1:06:01] Elders that are in the word those Elder
[1:06:05] when we have question we can reach out
[1:06:07] to them and say brother I have a
[1:06:09] question how did you solve this thing
[1:06:11] how did you see this and we Fellowship
[1:06:14] together are we together but I don't
[1:06:17] believe on the Elder that put a pressure
[1:06:20] on
[1:06:20] me I don't believe that I have somebody
[1:06:23] or a move or a click
[1:06:26] or a group going on in a message that
[1:06:29] before I preach something I need to make
[1:06:31] sure I line up with them this is why we
[1:06:34] in the trouble that we
[1:06:37] are because there is no
[1:06:40] Freedom amen I am not preaching what I'm
[1:06:44] preaching con I mean in line with an
[1:06:47] elder no in line with the
[1:06:51] message as long as it's in the message
[1:06:54] it's in the Bible then we can preach it
[1:06:57] so when I say I do not have a bishop it
[1:07:01] is not
[1:07:04] proud but I seen churches being abused
[1:07:08] by Elders I've been in this message for
[1:07:11] a while and I never want it to happen in
[1:07:14] this church
[1:07:17] never am clear I was an assistant
[1:07:21] dentist before and I seen how dentist uh
[1:07:26] some of them amen were abusing the stuff
[1:07:32] when they come they yelling they say
[1:07:33] this and I made a decision I say if I
[1:07:36] ever become a dentist a doctor I would
[1:07:40] never treat my staff like that and go to
[1:07:43] my office and ask my staff right there I
[1:07:46] don't even talk to them much I'm in my
[1:07:48] office because I'm looking at my coat
[1:07:50] and my stuff when they call me I go pull
[1:07:52] a tooth and go back and continue with my
[1:07:54] coat that's way
[1:07:56] I in other word as long as you keep what
[1:07:59] you're supposed to do me and you will
[1:08:00] never
[1:08:02] talk and ask them I increase their
[1:08:04] salary without even a meeting or them
[1:08:07] asking me they just see oh thank you
[1:08:09] very much they that's it I don't have
[1:08:11] time for meeting meeting meeting me too
[1:08:12] much headache that's the same way I made
[1:08:16] the decision for this church never
[1:08:20] somebody to abuse this church because we
[1:08:23] were hurt from where we came out am so
[1:08:25] made my decision to make sure you are
[1:08:28] respected you are honored you are
[1:08:31] cherished and you are treated well even
[1:08:35] if somebody come on the poopet when they
[1:08:36] talk to you they need to know how
[1:08:39] they're talking to
[1:08:41] you amen so when I say I don't have a
[1:08:45] bishop this is what I meant amen I'm not
[1:08:48] saying I don't have brothers or I'm
[1:08:52] independent I'm independent as far as
[1:08:55] has Clicks in the message I cannot get
[1:08:58] into any clicks I refuse
[1:09:01] [Applause]
[1:09:04] clicks so if you know there is a click
[1:09:07] of preacher where they have convention
[1:09:09] only certain preachers are preaching
[1:09:10] there me I'm not there but I can shake
[1:09:13] hand I can fellowship with them but I'm
[1:09:15] not going to get in any move Ministry
[1:09:19] the ters this move this hey I don't want
[1:09:21] to get into that I want to stay with the
[1:09:24] word and with the message of the hour
[1:09:27] but I can fellowship with everyone as
[1:09:30] long as they stay in the
[1:09:33] word are we together are we together so
[1:09:37] and don't disrespect anyone I'm just
[1:09:40] making a point that when I'm speaking
[1:09:43] I'm speaking freely and every church is
[1:09:46] Sovereign so please sistera do me a
[1:09:50] little clip tick Tok and keep it aside
[1:09:54] so that when somebody ask a question or
[1:09:56] something this is where I'm coming from
[1:09:59] amen because usually people will stay
[1:10:02] there PhD on looking for trouble they're
[1:10:05] looking for one thing to poke
[1:10:07] you just trying to destroy your
[1:10:13] character are we together are we
[1:10:15] together so we respect the Elder
[1:10:18] whenever I see an now day I usually do
[1:10:20] this because they work for the kingdom
[1:10:23] of God Amen but I'm
[1:10:26] Sovereign amen but when we talk we
[1:10:29] talking Sovereign to Sovereign I cannot
[1:10:32] see an and Shake I cannot do that when I
[1:10:36] talk to them I look at their
[1:10:38] eyes if what you say is not the word of
[1:10:41] God
[1:10:43] period I'm going to look at you in the
[1:10:47] eye even if my church is two people
[1:10:49] yours is a big church I'm still
[1:10:52] Sovereign with two people
[1:10:58] are we together because the denomination
[1:11:01] spirit that brother BR was talking about
[1:11:04] entered in the message and already
[1:11:08] maneuver in the message and if you still
[1:11:10] looking at the Baptist the Methodist you
[1:11:12] wasting time they are all in the message

[1:17:56] we commit it all and ask it in Jesus
[1:17:58] precious name amen amen glory to God now
[1:18:02] you can turn your clock
[1:18:06] on we okay now amen glory to God Psalm
[1:18:10] 82 verse
[1:18:12] 1 a Psalm of aav
[1:18:16] God stands in the congregation of the
[1:18:20] mighty you might be
[1:18:22] seated he God
[1:18:25] judges among the gods now these
[1:18:29] scripture are more clear to you than
[1:18:31] ever amen then when we jum in verse six
[1:18:35] the Bible say I have said who's talking
[1:18:39] there
[1:18:40] God it's important to know that it's God
[1:18:43] talking that's right amen because when
[1:18:46] something come out from the mouth of God
[1:18:48] it's very special yes sir the Bible says
[1:18:50] I have said that ye are Gods amen so God
[1:18:56] says that you are God's so it's not me
[1:19:00] let every man's word be a lie but his
[1:19:03] word only be the truth so whether you
[1:19:05] believe it or not I believe that I'm a
[1:19:07] God
[1:19:09] Amen we clear amen and all of you
[1:19:15] all amen amen why can you look at
[1:19:18] somebody you looking at the congregation
[1:19:20] and you
[1:19:22] say you are God
[1:19:25] who am I talking to I'm talking to the
[1:19:28] congregation I'm talking to everybody
[1:19:30] that is here I say you are God am then I
[1:19:33] come back again and I say all of you so
[1:19:37] meaning maybe
[1:19:42] somebody in the
[1:19:44] congregation doesn't really think he
[1:19:52] is did I miss you me started again when
[1:19:57] I'm preaching I'm preaching to who
[1:19:58] everybody that is here if you somewhere
[1:20:01] on the street then I'm not preaching to
[1:20:02] you that's so when I come and say good
[1:20:06] evening spoken word or good morning
[1:20:08] spoken word I'm talking to all of you
[1:20:11] but when I turn around and I say all of
[1:20:13] you good morning it means I want to make
[1:20:17] sure that everybody that is present is
[1:20:22] included because there could be somebody
[1:20:26] struggling and say wait a minute me a
[1:20:30] God I don't know me can I really be a
[1:20:34] God so God knows us better than
[1:20:37] our and God knowing that he said all of
[1:20:41] you to make sure you don't come up again
[1:20:44] with a question because somebody may
[1:20:47] come out and say do you know what
[1:20:48] brother Steven was talking about he was
[1:20:50] talking about me amen because I talked
[1:20:53] with brother Steven yesterday
[1:20:55] so because me and brother Steven were
[1:20:57] talking yesterday so when he said that
[1:20:59] he's talking about me but I was also
[1:21:02] there we all
[1:21:04] heard amen so God remove that that that
[1:21:09] uh option sir so that no one can say
[1:21:12] that uhuh he was talking about myself no
[1:21:16] if you come you say brother Steven you
[1:21:17] were talking about me I was say m I say
[1:21:20] all of you that's right God were you
[1:21:23] talking about uh so and so no no no no
[1:21:26] God say all of
[1:21:27] you are children of the most high so
[1:21:31] there is no exception
[1:21:33] here amen are we together so remove your
[1:21:38] complexes of what you think you are not
[1:21:41] that's right this is the problem with
[1:21:43] Gideon in the Bible when God look at him
[1:21:45] he said Mighty Man of Valor and he's
[1:21:48] looking at God like who me of course do
[1:21:50] you think God made a
[1:21:52] mistake God sees beyond what you can see
[1:21:56] God sees what he did in your life before
[1:21:59] you even know it before you are even
[1:22:03] aware of who you are God already knows
[1:22:06] you and God say that all of
[1:22:10] you are children of the most high God
[1:22:14] why is this important brother Steven why
[1:22:16] do you always keep repeating this
[1:22:18] subject for three month
[1:22:22] amen the Bible says in 1 John chapter 3
[1:22:27] verse 1
[1:22:29] behold behold what what manner of what
[1:22:34] love who the father father means he got
[1:22:39] children amen yes sir what manner of
[1:22:42] love the father has bestowed upon
[1:22:47] us that which should be
[1:22:51] called the what the sons of God so when
[1:22:54] you are called a Son of God it is an
[1:22:58] expression of love amen and not just any
[1:23:02] kind of love but it's a supreme in other
[1:23:04] word what manner of love what greatest
[1:23:08] love have God expressed to us amen by
[1:23:12] dying at the cross of course that was
[1:23:15] love but John here is saying by you
[1:23:18] being called a Son of God so when God's
[1:23:21] call you a son of God God is actually
[1:23:25] expressing his greatest love upon
[1:23:30] you the Bible says what manner of
[1:23:33] love the father has bestow upon us that
[1:23:37] we should be called The Who The Son of
[1:23:40] God therefore the world knoweth as
[1:23:45] not so this identity here don't expect
[1:23:49] the world to know it no sir the world
[1:23:52] will know it by manifestation
[1:23:55] amen
[1:23:57] amen you will know it by Revelation am
[1:24:00] and when your Revelation become flesh
[1:24:04] become a life in you then the people of
[1:24:07] the world will see a television
[1:24:10] amen they will begin to watch the movie
[1:24:13] of God Amen a human being being God
[1:24:18] Amen are we together therefore the world
[1:24:22] know us not because because he knew him
[1:24:25] what not amen the beig god they didn't
[1:24:29] know
[1:24:30] him amen when Peter knew him he said
[1:24:34] Peter Flesh and Blood did not reveal
[1:24:38] this to you so you only know him by
[1:24:42] Revelation amen amen amen listen to what
[1:24:45] brother Bram says here brother Bram say
[1:24:48] in the message God's power to transform
[1:24:50] he says now we can Fellowship

[1:24:58] in which you are a part of when we say a
[1:25:01] part of everybody love it because he
[1:25:03] means I'm a little portion of the word
[1:25:07] brother Bram say you are part of the
[1:25:11] word everybody will say
[1:25:13] Amen because he was the word at the
[1:25:18] beginning you are the word

[1:29:43] says in John 11 verse 49 and one of them
[1:29:47] named chaas being the high priest that
[1:29:50] same year say unto them ye know nothing
[1:29:54] at all nor consider that it is
[1:29:58] expedient for us that one man should die
[1:30:02] for the people and that the whole what
[1:30:05] nation that nation was
[1:30:07] Israel that the whole nation perish not
[1:30:11] and this spake he not of
[1:30:15] himself but being high priest that year
[1:30:19] he prophesies that Jesus should die for
[1:30:23] that Nation
[1:30:25] Israel the Bible continue and not for
[1:30:29] that Nation
[1:30:30] only why because God has his children
[1:30:35] scattered in many Nation that's why the
[1:30:39] Bible say out of every nation and
[1:30:41] Kindred and tongue God is pulling his
[1:30:44] brother in other word God took us as
[1:30:48] seed and Scatter us all over the world
[1:30:50] and God knows where you are and who is
[1:30:53] who
[1:30:54] at the appointed time God will send a

[1:31:15] children of the most high
[1:31:19] god listen he say and not for that
[1:31:22] Nation only
[1:31:25] but that also he God should gather
[1:31:29] together in
[1:31:32] one so there is a one come on brother
[1:31:36] and we need to be gathered in the
[1:31:38] one
[1:31:43] amen I don't know if you get that one
[1:31:46] that's why the Bible say one sat on the
[1:31:50] throne the Bible never said one man sat
[1:31:53] on the throne
[1:31:54] you know that right do you know that do
[1:31:58] you know that the bible say that when

[1:32:25] Bible didn't say that the Bible say one
[1:32:27] sat on the throne and the Bible say here
[1:32:30] we will be gathered all in
[1:32:34] one that's why the Bible say you will
[1:32:37] sit on the throne with him how can all
[1:32:40] of us sit on one
[1:32:43] Throne we need to go back to
[1:32:46] one when Jesus is in the one and all of
[1:32:49] us in one one will sit on the throne it
[1:32:58] are we
[1:33:02] together this is one that's right amen
[1:33:06] this is the one that sat on the throne
[1:33:09] amen this is Brother kayy this is
[1:33:12] Brother John this is brother Greg this
[1:33:15] is brother Michael Omar uh this is
[1:33:18] Brother patient amen when we are outside
[1:33:22] we are individuals
[1:33:25] are we together but if you you cross
[1:33:27] this and you put it here Amen brother
[1:33:31] Michael is now
[1:33:34] one are we together and then you cross
[1:33:37] one you put him here and you cross six
[1:33:39] you put him here and you cross this you
[1:33:41] put it here and you cross this and then
[1:33:43] you put it here then we are gathered in
[1:33:45] one now God take one and put him on the
[1:33:48] throne
[1:33:54] are we together because husband and wife
[1:33:58] are Jesus and you are Jesus and his
[1:34:02] bride are so when the bride is United
[1:34:05] back to the husband they become and God
[1:34:09] take one and put one on the
[1:34:12] [Applause]
[1:34:17] throne you are looking at a big Throne
[1:34:20] where everybody will sit and we say push
[1:34:23] a little bit then this one say that's
[1:34:26] not the Throne of God Throne is
[1:34:29] something else one of this day we will
[1:34:30] preach about what is that throne but but
[1:34:33] the main thing is be G in
[1:34:36] Christ get in the one when you get in
[1:34:39] the one then you are guaranteed the
[1:34:41] Throne of
[1:34:43] God are we together and this one here is
[1:34:47] God that's
[1:34:49] right so when you enter there and no one
[1:34:54] can enter into God and blend with God if
[1:34:57] you are not made of the same material
[1:35:00] that's why brother Bram say you are the
[1:35:02] word because in the beginning he was the
[1:35:05] word your material are compatible amen
[1:35:09] that's why you can blend together and no
[1:35:11] one can make the difference who is Jesus
[1:35:14] and who's not
[1:35:15] Jesus
[1:35:18] amen are we together amen and not only
[1:35:22] for that Nation on
[1:35:24] but that also he should Gather in one
[1:35:27] what the children of God that were how
[1:35:30] scattered abroad that's why Jesus say I
[1:35:33] have sheep that are not of this fold
[1:35:36] brother Bram say he was talking to the
[1:35:37] Jews but there were other sheep that
[1:35:39] were from somewhere else so God need to
[1:35:42] gather everybody and put the children of
[1:35:45] God in one when the children of God are
[1:35:49] in one they are
[1:35:51] one amen now one can s can go and sit on
[1:35:55] the throne that's right ye are Gods all
[1:35:58] of you are children of the most high god

[1:36:05] 15
[1:36:08] amen we are
[1:36:11] so embedded in
[1:36:14] humanity that's why it's
[1:36:16] hard to begin to accept Divine
[1:36:21] language amen amen
[1:36:24] but what you forget God gave us the best
[1:36:27] example he came himself and live in
[1:36:31] flesh to show you that God can be
[1:36:36] hungry for you according to the movie
[1:36:39] the the Greek

[1:36:48] liquid God say that's myology I'm coming
[1:36:52] in human flesh
[1:36:54] give me a
[1:36:56] fish according to you God should be

[1:37:10] mother-in-law and God sit down and
[1:37:12] waiting for

[1:37:19] him from being God
[1:37:21] [Laughter]
[1:37:24] do you see what I'm saying in other word
[1:37:27] God is not what you

[1:37:32] time that God can be coming into a river
[1:37:35] and forget and just keep walking on the
[1:37:39] river then we the one he's walking on oh

[1:53:47] right here we clear right and there is a
[1:53:50] distance right here he was great Far Far
[1:53:53] Away amen great way off that's what the
[1:53:57] Bible says and then the father gave all

[1:54:08] Him Father I have Sinn against Heaven
[1:54:11] the Zeal of the age and in your sight
[1:54:13] I'm no more worthy to be called your son
[1:54:16] but the father said to his servant bring
[1:54:18] forth the best robe you understand what
[1:54:21] it means and put on him amen and put a
[1:54:25] ring on his hand and shoes on his feet

[1:54:46] why for this my son was dead is now how
[1:54:51] alive again alive again he was lost and
[1:54:54] is what found and they began to be how
[1:54:57] married so this party here that is going
[1:55:00] on here concern the people that were
[1:55:03] dead you remember that Sunday and now
[1:55:07] they are what so it concerned the
[1:55:09] sleeping scent that's right amen those
[1:55:14] that were under
[1:55:15] corruption but when they raised they
[1:55:17] raised with
[1:55:19] incorruption and those that were lost
[1:55:23] and they were found which is the Living
[1:55:26] Center amen because Paul say we shall
[1:55:30] not all die so some will stay alive and
[1:55:34] some will be dead but at the end of the
[1:55:36] day all of them will be Chang and the
[1:55:39] last Trump so it's a feast of the
[1:55:43] Redeemer that's right amen a feast of
[1:55:46] those that went in the
[1:55:49] Rapture and the one who goes in the
[1:55:51] rapture is the Brad which is the younger
[1:55:55] son right are we together and we notice
[1:55:59] that the the the the instruction was
[1:56:03] given here but there is a
[1:56:06] time of
[1:56:09] preparation amen because brother Bram
[1:56:12] said there are three things let's pick
[1:56:15] up now he says one of them is the shout
[1:56:19] he said the first things that come forth
[1:56:21] is his
[1:56:22] message calling the bride how the next
[1:56:27] is the resurrection of the sleeping
[1:56:29] bride that's why he said those that was
[1:56:31] dead and I alive the one die back in the
[1:56:35] other ages they are caught up how
[1:56:38] together and the trumpet the feast in
[1:56:40] the what heaven where in the sky in the
[1:56:43] sky so the first the last thing that is
[1:56:46] remain is for all of them to go back in
[1:56:49] the
[1:56:50] house are we together together and have
[1:56:53] a feast in the house that's right amen
[1:56:57] so in between this time the killing and
[1:57:00] and the cooking and everything with
[1:57:02] sister p and sister Lael and sistera all
[1:57:06] the preparation of those things by the
[1:57:08] time we get there the fist began but if
[1:57:11] you notice the Bible says that and then
[1:57:14] they begin to make Merry that's right so
[1:57:18] the Bible doesn't tell us the exact time
[1:57:23] that's right that the feast
[1:57:25] started amen we know that there will be
[1:57:29] a feast we know that we need to kill the
[1:57:32] fatted Cal we need to cook it and
[1:57:34] everything but as far as when is the
[1:57:37] time that the F started the Bible
[1:57:39] doesn't say it because Jesus himself
[1:57:42] said that the father only knows
[1:57:45] it nobody knows the hour only the father
[1:57:49] knows it so right here the still hold
[1:57:53] that coming that's right brother that's
[1:57:56] right are we together are we together
[1:57:59] are we together now the important things
[1:58:02] is when everything is going on until the
[1:58:07] party start or the feast started are we
[1:58:10] together the Elder son is completely not
[1:58:14] there that's right he's not at home he's
[1:58:18] not right here he's not in the house and
[1:58:21] even when the part is started he's not
[1:58:24] even
[1:58:26] there are we together he's completely
[1:58:30] absent so what happened let's pick up
[1:58:33] now let's go to Matthew
[1:58:36] 21 now we getting there if you there you
[1:58:40] can say
[1:58:42] amen hallelujah father help me so we can
[1:58:46] get to this let's see where we are we
[1:58:49] are good amen amen Matthew 21 verse 23
[1:58:54] if you there you can say Amen the Bible
[1:58:57] says amen and
[1:59:01] Jesus uh and when he come into the
[1:59:04] temple The Who Chief priest the chief
[1:59:07] priest you remember that one right the

[1:59:24] by what Authority do you these things
[1:59:27] and who gave you this Authority you
[1:59:29] understand who's asking the question
[1:59:31] jump to verse 33 we getting good my
[1:59:34] friend verse 33 and here in another
[1:59:38] Parable there was a certain
[1:59:42] householder which means a farmer or a
[1:59:45] Vine grower which planted a
[1:59:48] Vineyard and he did what hedged it round
[1:59:51] about follow me carefully he hedg it

[2:00:25] out that what the vineyard was was
[2:00:29] Israel you remember that Lord help me
[2:00:32] all right in Isaiah 5 the Bible says now
[2:00:36] I will sing to my who well beloved a
[2:00:40] song of my beloved so this person here

[2:01:03] same person asaiah is singing to him he
[2:01:06] says he my beloved touching what his
[2:01:10] Vineyard so the owner of the vineyard
[2:01:13] according to Isaiah is the well beloved
[2:01:16] follow me
[2:01:17] carefully the owner of this Vineyard is
[2:01:21] the well beloved or the Beloved right
[2:01:25] the Beloved is the
[2:01:28] owner you going to see how scripture
[2:01:30] work together amen my beloved has a
[2:01:34] Vineyard he's the owner in a very
[2:01:36] fruitful Hill and he did what f it do
[2:01:40] you see what Jesus was talking about

[2:01:45] did what planted it do you see what
[2:01:47] Jesus was talking about yes with the
[2:01:49] choice van and built a what a tower you
[2:01:52] see that yes and in the midst of it and
[2:01:54] also made a what a wine press there you
[2:01:57] see that so all characteristic of Jesus
[2:01:59] Christ came from Isaiah amen and he
[2:02:02] looked that he should bring forth grape
[2:02:05] and he brought forth what wild grapes
[2:02:08] for the vineyard of the Lord of host is
[2:02:11] who the house of Israel so this Vineyard
[2:02:14] is the house of Israel are we clear now
[2:02:17] the Lord planted hedged fence it built a
[2:02:20] wine PR and heav thing and and a tower
[2:02:23] in it we clear now jum now where we are
[2:02:27] in verse
[2:02:29] 34 and then and when the time of what
[2:02:32] the fruit Drew near he sent his servant
[2:02:35] to the what the husbandman so the
[2:02:38] servant don't come at any time that's
[2:02:43] right the servant only come at the time
[2:02:48] of the fruit follow me carefully
[2:02:51] let me read it again let's go slowly
[2:02:55] verse 34 and when the time of the fruit
[2:02:59] Drew n in other word the Harvest was
[2:03:03] closer that's when the servant he sent
[2:03:07] his servant to the husband man that he
[2:03:10] they might receive the what the fruits
[2:03:12] of it so God won't send his servant if
[2:03:16] the time of the fruit is not closer
[2:03:19] that's right
[2:03:20] amen amen let's go slowly amen amen
[2:03:25] there is a farm amen amen in the farm we
[2:03:29] got crops amen as crops are growing and
[2:03:33] everything God is quiet yes amen when he
[2:03:37] comes when they begin to B God is quiet
[2:03:40] when the fruit begin to form amen that
[2:03:44] is the time God sent a messenger so when
[2:03:47] you see a messenger appearing
[2:03:53] [Applause]
[2:03:55] it is an
[2:03:56] indication that there is some fruit
[2:04:01] there I don't know if we together
[2:04:04] because God cannot send his
[2:04:07] word void his word cannot return to him
[2:04:11] void when he s his word his word has a
[2:04:15] purpose and his word goes with his
[2:04:18] servant the prophet amen so when a
[2:04:21] prophet appear on the scene it is the
[2:04:24] Harvest
[2:04:26] time are we together it is the time of
[2:04:30] the fruit in other word Ali won't come
[2:04:34] if there is no
[2:04:35] Rebecca when Ali begin to move it's
[2:04:39] because Rebecca is Right
[2:04:43] amen because Rebecca is ready for
[2:04:46] marriage that's why is is moving I will
[2:04:51] send you Elijah the Prophet Elijah won't
[2:04:55] come if I'm not
[2:04:56] [Applause]
[2:04:59] there because Elijah came and brother
[2:05:03] Steven must be there to receive the
[2:05:07] Elijah
[2:05:11] amen William Marion Branham in the
[2:05:14] message birth pen brother Bram say I
[2:05:17] know there be somebody where somewhere
[2:05:20] would do what would believe
[2:05:22] God would not send a message unless
[2:05:25] there be somebody to do what receive
[2:05:30] [Applause]
[2:05:32] it so this message is not for
[2:05:36] [Applause]
[2:05:38] everybody those that receive the message
[2:05:42] are the fruits of
[2:05:48] God are we together are we together
[2:05:52] are we together remember the shout come
[2:05:54] to GA and the servant are coming to GA
[2:05:58] to gather the fruit so when you hear the
[2:06:02] message and you receive the message you
[2:06:05] are actually a
[2:06:07] [Applause]
[2:06:11] fruit I know when I say fruit when I say
[2:06:15] fruit you you in your mind you have love
[2:06:17] peace longsuffering don't worry we will
[2:06:19] get to what the fruit is amen a fruit is
[2:06:23] somebody a fruit is an
[2:06:25] individual a fruit is a person you are
[2:06:29] the fruit of your
[2:06:32] mother you are the fruit of your mother
[2:06:35] and your father so God knows that this
[2:06:39] time I got sister charene there this
[2:06:42] time I got brother Loos there when they
[2:06:45] are already sent the
[2:06:47] messenger and when the messenger came
[2:06:50] somebody is already there a Rea is
[2:06:53] already there that will be also moved
[2:06:56] toward the for some reason she came
[2:07:00] alone why did she came alone and nobody
[2:07:03] was there because God was looking for
[2:07:10] one her mother didn't go with her her
[2:07:14] brother didn't go with her her uncle
[2:07:16] didn't go with her her father didn't go
[2:07:19] with her so sometime you be the only one
[2:07:22] from a
[2:07:25] [Applause]
[2:07:29] family are we together are we together
[2:07:34] are we
[2:07:35] together glory to God the Bible says in
[2:07:38] verse 34 when the time of the fruit
[2:07:41] junai he sent his what servants plural
[2:07:45] amen do the husband man that they might
[2:07:48] receive the what the fruits of it 3 five
[2:07:52] and the husband took the servant and did
[2:07:54] what and beat
[2:07:57] one they took the servant and beat one
[2:08:00] and what else and killed another so
[2:08:02] there is some killing going on and what
[2:08:04] else and stoned another and stoned
[2:08:07] another it's beat killing and
[2:08:10] stoning keep those word amen beat
[2:08:14] killing and stoning again he sent are
[2:08:17] the what servants more than the first

[2:08:23] words they did the same thing beat Stone
[2:08:27] and kill are we together are we together
[2:08:31] amen verse 37 but what last of all he
[2:08:35] sent unto them his son so the son was
[2:08:41] there the son when he was sending the
[2:08:44] servant the son was there when he sent
[2:08:47] the servant again the son was there but
[2:08:50] the son was the last
[2:08:54] resource in other words the son was the
[2:08:57] last
[2:09:01] messenger I'm going slowly my friend sir
[2:09:06] amen so when God deal with a
[2:09:10] dispensation he will first send servant
[2:09:14] servant servant servant servant when the
[2:09:18] dispensation is about to be finished
[2:09:22] the one who come won't be a servant it
[2:09:26] will be the
[2:09:30] son I don't know if we are together at
[2:09:34] the beginning you will receive a servant
[2:09:36] at the beginning a servant after while a
[2:09:39] servant but when the dispensation is end
[2:09:43] only the son will
[2:09:46] come the S will come not anyone else so
[2:09:50] when you see the son just know the
[2:09:53] dispensation is at
[2:09:59] end are we together are we together are
[2:10:03] we together yes sir are we
[2:10:06] together the last
[2:10:09] messenger I'm going with this Parable
[2:10:13] then we're going to take this Parable
[2:10:14] and go back to the Elder son if you give
[2:10:17] me time amen so the last messenger
[2:10:22] amen he always who the
[2:10:27] son amen amen let's continue with this
[2:10:31] son the Bible say and last of all this
[2:10:35] is what the Bible say he sent to them
[2:10:38] who his
[2:10:39] son how many son
[2:10:42] One Singular saying they will receive
[2:10:46] who they will reverence my son but when
[2:10:49] the husband man saw the son from a far
[2:10:53] off like Joseph brother when they saw
[2:10:56] him from a far off they begin to
[2:10:57] conspire you remember when they saw the
[2:11:01] son they said among themselves this is
[2:11:05] who the air stop so the son that come is
[2:11:10] the air yes sir yes sir am are we
[2:11:14] together the last messenger is the Son
[2:11:17] and that son is the air
[2:11:21] amen we need to know who is this
[2:11:25] son are we together but before the son
[2:11:29] come there will be servant and those
[2:11:33] servant will be
[2:11:34] stoned beaten and killed who are the
[2:11:41] servant are we together the Bible says
[2:11:44] in Matthew 23 verse 34 wherefore behold
[2:11:49] I said unto you who prophets and what
[2:11:53] and wise men and what and scribes and
[2:11:56] some of them you shall do what kill and
[2:11:58] crucify and some of them you shall do
[2:12:01] what scorge in your synagogues and
[2:12:03] persecute them from what city to city oh
[2:12:08] Jerusalem
[2:12:10] Jerusalem die follow me carefully beaing
[2:12:14] killing and what stoning th that do what
[2:12:18] killest the prophet and do what stonest
[2:12:21] them which are sent unto thee you see
[2:12:24] Killing and stoning you kill the prophet
[2:12:27] and stone them which are sent unto thee
[2:12:30] how often would I have what gathered thy
[2:12:32] children together even as a hand
[2:12:35] gathereth her chicken under her wings
[2:12:37] but what and you would not so it is the
[2:12:39] behavior of the Jew come on
[2:12:43] brother to kill and to Stone
[2:12:48] prophets amen so this
[2:12:51] sent our
[2:12:55] prophets I have just read it my friend
[2:12:58] you who kill what the prophet and do
[2:13:01] what and stone it them and and stone who
[2:13:04] them that are what so who is
[2:13:07] sent who is killed who is Stone Propet
[2:13:12] the prophets so the
[2:13:14] servants the servants
[2:13:17] amen are the prophet in the day days of
[2:13:21] the voice of the seven Angel when he
[2:13:24] shall begin to sign all the mysteries of
[2:13:28] God should be finished as he has
[2:13:31] declared to his servant the prophet and
[2:13:35] now you begin to understand amen so God
[2:13:39] was sending Prophet to
[2:13:41] Israel and Israel was killing the
[2:13:43] prophet and then at last God send his
[2:13:47] son right let's see but this

[2:14:51] Jesus say the Beloved is the son of the
[2:14:57] H are we together let me help you with
[2:15:00] this the Bible says in Mark 12 and again
[2:15:04] he said another and him they did what
[2:15:08] same Parable and many other doing what
[2:15:11] beating some and killing some having
[2:15:15] yet therefore how many son one son
[2:15:21] so this son is only one
[2:15:24] begotten right are we together the son
[2:15:27] is the only begotten of the father amen
[2:15:32] he is what well
[2:15:36] beloved Jesus say the son is well
[2:15:41] Beloved the son is the Beloved and
[2:15:44] Isaiah say the Beloved and the well
[2:15:47] beloved is the honor that's right in
[2:15:49] other word me and my father We Are
[2:15:54] One in word the son was only the father
[2:15:59] in another
[2:16:00] form are we together now are we together
[2:16:04] so the Son and the father are
[2:16:06] one Hallelujah are we together because
[2:16:10] God doesn't share his glory with
[2:16:12] somebody else he keepeth his glory with
[2:16:16] someone himself but Jesus was full of
[2:16:19] the glory of the father
[2:16:22] and Jesus said the glory that I have I
[2:16:25] give it to you but God doesn't share his
[2:16:28] glory with
[2:16:30] anyone hallu you didn't get it God say
[2:16:34] his glory he doesn't share with somebody
[2:16:38] but Jesus said the glory that I have me
[2:16:41] God I give it to
[2:16:42] [Applause]
[2:16:45] you you didn't get me again let me start
[2:16:49] it again the B say God doesn't share his
[2:16:53] glory with anyone God keep his glory to
[2:16:57] himself but Jesus said the glory that I
[2:17:01] have I also give it to
[2:17:05] you so who are
[2:17:08] you who are
[2:17:14] you in other word when God give you his
[2:17:18] glory it is like he kept his glory to
[2:17:22] himself it looks like his glory didn't
[2:17:24] move it is still in God so you are

[2:19:55] do what kill him and The Inheritance
[2:19:57] shall be who
[2:20:00] ours are we clear let's go back to our
[2:20:03] scripture father help me as I'm
[2:20:05] navigating this amen amen jum to verse
[2:20:10] uh 39 and they caught him and did what
[2:20:14] cast him out of the vineyard and did
[2:20:16] what and slew him so they slew him
[2:20:18] outside of the vineyard
[2:20:20] that's why the Bible say Jesus suffer
[2:20:23] outside the
[2:20:25] gate you remember that amen and when the
[2:20:29] Lord therefore of the vineyard cometh
[2:20:32] what he what he what will he do to those
[2:20:35] husband they say to him he will
[2:20:38] miserably do what destroy those wicked
[2:20:41] men and we let out his Vineyard to add
[2:20:46] husband men so there are two groups of
[2:20:49] husband men that's right
[2:20:51] the first group will be destroyed and
[2:20:54] the vineyard or The Inheritance will go
[2:20:57] toward a c other group follow me
[2:21:00] carefully
[2:21:01] amen that shall be which shall render
[2:21:04] him the
[2:21:06] fruits when in their Seasons so when The
[2:21:11] Inheritance goes to other fer those
[2:21:15] farmer have seasons amen amen and God
[2:21:19] will begin to send messenger again to
[2:21:24] collect the season of the
[2:21:27] new
[2:21:29] company they sold the first company unto
[2:21:33] a new company and hire new people to
[2:21:37] receive new fruits amen are we together
[2:21:41] are we together are we together jum to
[2:21:45] verse
[2:21:46] 43 therefore say I unto you the king om
[2:21:51] of God so the vineyard now means what
[2:21:55] the kingdom of God shall be taken from
[2:21:58] you follow me now
[2:22:01] carefully and give to a nation ah the
[2:22:06] kingdom will leave Israel and give to a
[2:22:11] nation watch that nation is singular
[2:22:13] that's right amen yes sir it is one
[2:22:16] nation will be given to a nation and
[2:22:20] amen One Nation to a nation amen they
[2:22:26] will give that Nation the kingdom of God
[2:22:29] and what happened my friend it will be
[2:22:31] given to a nation bringing forth the
[2:22:34] what fruits thereof so there will be a
[2:22:37] nation that will begin to bring fruit in
[2:22:40] it season amen amen jum to verse 45 and
[2:22:45] when the chief priest and the who
[2:22:49] Pharisees and the
[2:22:52] Pharisee have heard his Parable they
[2:22:56] perceived that he spoke of them so they
[2:22:59] understood that Jesus was talking about
[2:23:01] them that they're going to kill him and
[2:23:05] after the death of Jesus Christ The
[2:23:08] Gospel will leave the Jew that's right
[2:23:10] amen and go to the Gentile do you follow
[2:23:14] me but remember the PN is first
[2:23:18] messenger first servant and the last one
[2:23:23] is the son the son is the one that
[2:23:26] closes the
[2:23:29] dispensation are we together so the Jews
[2:23:33] will have a dispensation and the end of
[2:23:36] that dispensation will be God will
[2:23:39] reveal himself in human
[2:23:43] flesh and do the Messi
[2:23:46] son and he will be rejected and he will
[2:23:50] be be
[2:23:51] crucified and then rejected then the
[2:23:54] gospel goes to the Gentile and the
[2:23:56] Gentile will also begin to receive
[2:23:59] messenger so how do we know that the
[2:24:02] Gentile dispensation is
[2:24:04] finished look what God did the first
[2:24:08] time he's the
[2:24:10] same today and forever when you see the
[2:24:14] son revealing again in human
[2:24:18] flesh amen doing the Messi son it is
[2:24:22] telling you the gentle dispensation is
[2:24:26] also finished now the gospel need to go
[2:24:30] back
[2:24:31] [Applause]
[2:24:34] again are we together are we together
[2:24:38] God doesn't deal with the two husband
[2:24:41] men group together he doesn't deal with
[2:24:44] the youngest son and the Elder together
[2:24:47] when he deal with one one is out of the
[2:24:49] picture are we together where are you
[2:24:52] coming from with this brother Bram says
[2:24:56] this we could bring it down through the
[2:24:59] Old Testament and through the seven
[2:25:01] Church ages for the seventh stroke and
[2:25:03] so forth that looking through those
[2:25:06] streaks of blood the seven different
[2:25:09] streaks represented what seven Church
[2:25:11] ages Israel how natural and the Gentile
[2:25:15] how church in spiritual seven Church
[2:25:18] ages just exactly how the same way
[2:25:21] Israel had seven
[2:25:28] churches
[2:25:30] wow no problem let me read Bon again in
[2:25:34] the pmos vision now notice also the days
[2:25:37] of who Elijah when they had rejected
[2:25:40] Elijah as a prophet the leader thread
[2:25:43] the ancient church one of these days I
[2:25:46] shall bring it up and show you that
[2:25:49] Israel
[2:25:50] had what seven Church ages two and tap
[2:25:54] exactly with
[2:25:57] this amen so Israel has seven Church
[2:26:01] ages we okay now the Gentile have seven
[2:26:05] Church ages and the end of the seven
[2:26:08] Church ages is only when the sun come
[2:26:13] that's right this is why Paul says this
[2:26:16] in Hebrew he said
[2:26:18] God who
[2:26:22] s and D Man speak in the PTO Our Father
[2:26:27] by who the Prophet The Prophet has in
[2:26:30] these last days spoken unto us by his
[2:26:34] who son who he has appointed what heir
[2:26:37] of all things the son is the air of all
[2:26:42] things the son is the air of all
[2:26:47] thingsall so when Paul was talking Paul
[2:26:50] says we had Church ages and God was
[2:26:53] sending us Prophet but the last day of
[2:26:57] the Jews God sent his own son who was
[2:27:01] aeir of all things and him they crucify
[2:27:07] him are we together and reject him and
[2:27:10] the gospel mov completely into the who
[2:27:13] the genti listen to this my friend the
[2:27:16] Bible says this he said which of the
[2:27:18] Prophet have not you father do what
[2:27:21] persecuted and they have slain them with
[2:27:23] show before of the coming forth of who
[2:27:26] the just one of whom you be now the what
[2:27:29] betrayers and murderers amen so when
[2:27:33] they destroy the son they crucify him
[2:27:36] the Gentile the gospel left the Jews
[2:27:39] follow me carefully and it's given to
[2:27:42] the Gentile and when it's given to the
[2:27:44] genti God says that he will give to the
[2:27:47] Gen as a nation listen to what Peter
[2:27:51] says here he says but ye are a what a
[2:27:55] chosen generation a what a royal
[2:27:58] priesthood a what and holy nation you
[2:28:00] think he's talking about the Jews let's
[2:28:03] read it he said a what a peculiar people
[2:28:06] that you should suffer the what the
[2:28:09] Praises of him who who has called you
[2:28:12] out of what Darkness into what his
[2:28:15] marvelous life which in time pass you
[2:28:18] are not a people
[2:28:20] we were not the people of God the people
[2:28:23] of God was the Jews but God transferred
[2:28:27] The Inheritance the kingdom into a
[2:28:31] nation are we together are we together
[2:28:34] which in time pass we were not the
[2:28:37] people but are now the what people the
[2:28:41] people of God which has not obtained
[2:28:44] what Mercy but now has obtained what
[2:28:47] mercy so God as he did to the Jews begin
[2:28:50] to S
