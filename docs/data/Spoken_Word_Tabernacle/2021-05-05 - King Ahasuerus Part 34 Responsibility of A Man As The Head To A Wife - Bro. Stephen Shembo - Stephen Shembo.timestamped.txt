[31:39] going to bring you to the church for
[31:40] prayer

[31:54] blessed be the name of the lord even if
[31:57] the contract was signed
[32:00] god can turn things around amen

[34:26] genesis chapter 3 verse 16. if you're
[34:29] there you can say amen
[34:32] to the what not the man
[34:37] not the man and there is a reason for it
[34:41] to the woman not the man
[34:44] let's see what god says to the woman
[34:49] after the sin
[34:52] sin is already introduced to the woman
[34:55] he said i will greatly
[34:58] multiply your sorrow and your conception
[35:04] so when it comes to conceiving a baby
[35:07] it is not a responsibility of a man
[35:13] it is a responsibility of a woman
[35:17] sorrow with conception that's what he
[35:19] says he didn't say that to the man
[35:22] amen in sorrow you shall bring forth
[35:25] children that's the woman and your
[35:29] desire shall be to
[35:33] the desire of the woman
[35:38] i wish the whole church was here i even
[35:42] said it on sunday
[35:44] the desire of the woman must be directed
[35:47] to who
[35:49] and the husband compared to the woman
[35:51] he's what
[35:53] i'm glad it's coming from sister praise
[35:56] god
[35:56] i thought the brother should say head
[35:59] but now it's the sister
[36:01] amen and your desire shall be to your
[36:05] husband come on
[36:09] and he shall rule over you
[36:15] the husband now has been given
[36:19] the headship to rule
[36:22] over
[36:25] in other words he shall be responsible
[36:29] for you when you need something
[36:35] can you say amen when you need something
[36:38] you go to
[36:40] you ready to get married
[36:44] you ready
[36:48] no wonder the sisters are saying amen
[36:52] amen verse 17 and to who
[36:57] the man that's finished with the woman
[37:00] finish so don't put anything else god
[37:02] didn't put
[37:06] okay to the man
[37:11] what does god says to the man
[37:15] man is he and to adam he said
[37:19] because you have hearkened to the voice
[37:21] of your wife
[37:23] and have eaten of the tree and of which
[37:27] i commanded you saying
[37:29] you shall not eat curses the water
[37:36] you might be seated i was trying to go
[37:39] quick but
[37:40] something is dropping slowly
[37:43] and i gotta deal with it
[37:47] give me a minute because he was not on
[37:48] my note but the holy spirit just brought
[37:51] it to me
[37:52] keep where we are let's go to genesis
[37:54] chapter 2
[37:55] verse 5 and then we're going to come
[37:57] back there
[38:01] and every plant of the field
[38:04] before it was in the earth
[38:09] and every herb of the field before he
[38:12] grew
[38:13] for the lord god has not caused it to
[38:16] reign
[38:17] upon the earth and there was not
[38:20] water a man
[38:24] to do water
[38:27] ever clear so the responsibility of a
[38:31] man
[38:33] when they put man from the spirit into
[38:36] the body was for man to be able
[38:39] to contact the earth and to tilt the
[38:42] ground
[38:43] because god gave the responsibility of
[38:46] the garden unto the men
[38:48] in other words god gave man a job
[38:54] do you hear me before he got married
[38:59] so don't come in this church to get
[39:01] married when you don't have a job
[39:03] i'm not going to marry you
[39:08] if you need a coach you see me i also
[39:11] have a quote
[39:13] go listen to the choosing of the bride
[39:15] before brother branham
[39:16] married took a couple what
[39:20] what did he do he sat with them and
[39:22] asked them if the men
[39:24] were working where did brother branham
[39:26] get that
[39:29] he just made it up you learned enough in
[39:31] this church of them
[39:32] in this church about it amen
[39:38] let me get it again because something
[39:40] keeps coming back too my
[39:41] to my mind
[39:50] verse 15 yes lord and the lord
[39:54] took the man and put him into the garden
[39:58] of eden to do what
[40:02] in other words cultivate it to dress it
[40:05] and to do what so the responsibility the
[40:09] grand here
[40:11] was given as a labor for adam
[40:16] we understand how clearly now let's go
[40:18] back to our reading
[40:20] verse 17 chapter 3 verse 17
[40:23] and to adam he said because you have
[40:27] hearkened to the voice of your wife
[40:29] and you have eaten off the tree of which
[40:31] i commanded you
[40:32] saying you shall not eat of it curses
[40:35] the water
[40:38] you understand now where the the curse
[40:41] went
[40:42] curse is the ground why the ground
[40:46] why they didn't curse the ground for eve
[40:51] they cursed the ground for adam because
[40:54] work was not a responsibility for eve
[41:00] can you say amen work
[41:05] was a responsibility for men
[41:09] let's put everything back in order i'm
[41:11] the head i'm the head
[41:12] let me give you your headship and when i
[41:16] give you your headship
[41:17] you must do what the headship is
[41:19] supposed to do
[41:21] not a head to give command not a head to
[41:24] be the first one to eat
[41:27] you gotta understand what is the head
[41:30] now i will see
[41:31] how you gonna claim it again but you
[41:33] must claim it if god make you a man
[41:37] amen in sorrow
[41:41] shall you what the sorrow of the woman
[41:44] was for the birth
[41:47] not for the ground
[41:50] amen in sorrow i hope
[41:54] those that are not here tonight that are
[41:57] home they are streaming
[42:00] amen in sorrow shall you eat of it
[42:04] all the days of your life in other words
[42:07] the labor of a man
[42:09] become hard it was a pleasure at the
[42:12] beginning
[42:13] now they did something to the ground and
[42:15] he makes it hard
[42:17] amen but jesus when he went on the cross
[42:20] he took that curse
[42:21] and put it in so as a man your work
[42:24] should be a leisure
[42:26] because jesus restored you back to what
[42:29] adam lost
[42:30] so a word should not be a burden for a
[42:32] young man
[42:34] a work would should not be a burden for
[42:38] er for a husband
[42:42] hallelujah verse 18
[42:45] thorn also and peace which jesus had on
[42:49] on his head shall it bring forth to you
[42:53] and you shall eat the herb of the water
[42:57] off the field the ground verse 19
[43:00] in the sweat of your the face of who
[43:07] is the woman supposed to sweat
[43:11] she's going to sweat in delivery
[43:14] you sweat on the warehouse
[43:23] we try to switch stuff like this and
[43:26] still you're not going to give a baby
[43:28] you're not going to be burying a baby
[43:31] she's going to work and yet she got to
[43:33] bring your children so she work on the
[43:35] double
[43:38] you see now from the scripture
[43:42] and in the sweat of your face the man
[43:45] shall you eat bread till you return
[43:49] to the ground for out of it were you
[43:52] taken
[43:53] for dust you are and to that shall you
[43:56] return so right here in genesis
[43:59] we understand that motherhood
[44:02] was given to the woman motherhood
[44:08] everybody clear but the responsibility
[44:12] to work was given to the man
[44:17] from the beginning let's go to isaiah 4.
[44:25] like i said you heard me those that are
[44:27] going to come behind
[44:29] you don't have a job don't talk to me
[44:31] about marriage
[44:34] and not just a job that you work 20
[44:36] hours a week
[44:39] because you're not going to be able to
[44:40] pay the apartment
[44:43] so you're still not ready to get married
[44:50] oh my god you work 20 hours a week 16
[44:55] hours a week you want to get married
[44:58] i'm going to live in food stamp
[45:06] let me leave that alone isaiah 4
[45:09] verse 1 and in that day seven women
[45:13] shall take hold of one man i already
[45:15] told you about this
[45:17] saying we will eat our own water
[45:21] so in this time the women
[45:24] begin to make their own bread
[45:29] everybody clear now brother branham said
[45:32] that's the prophecy of the end time
[45:34] in isaiah 4 instead of the man
[45:38] bringing the bread the woman now
[45:41] is the one taking care of her own bread
[45:45] while in genesis the bread was
[45:49] the responsibility of adam you want to
[45:52] see
[45:53] what what what a deadly thing it is with
[45:55] this kind of stuff
[45:59] and i'm going to read it to you from the
[46:00] scripture
[46:03] amen and where
[46:06] you're on apparel
[46:10] who eat your bible so somebody's not in
[46:13] tune here
[46:14] and wear your own apparel
[46:18] our it is their clothing
[46:22] not your clothing the woman take care of
[46:25] her bread
[46:27] she's taking care of her own clothing
[46:31] and you think it's normal
[46:36] only let us be called by your
[46:40] i want to become mrs so-and-so
[46:43] but i am the one responsible for myself
[46:50] you see let him let i want to get
[46:53] married
[46:55] i want to carry your name so they can
[46:58] call me
[46:59] mrs x but
[47:02] when it comes to the responsibility
[47:05] i have it to take away our
[47:09] reproach so marriage is not a spiritual
[47:13] revelation
[47:14] but marriage is done for a purpose
[47:18] and the purpose is only to remove a
[47:20] reproach
[47:22] she just doesn't want to appear among
[47:25] people like she's a bad woman
[47:28] so i just want a husband but i can live
[47:32] on my own
[47:33] don't tell me what to do with my money
[47:37] in that day shall the branch of the lord
[47:41] be beautiful and glorious and the fruit
[47:43] of the earth shall be excellent
[47:45] and calmly for them that are escape of
[47:48] israel
[47:50] and it shall come to pass that he
[47:53] that is left in zion brother obama said
[47:55] that's the bride
[47:57] and he that remains in jerusalem that's
[48:00] 144 thousand
[48:02] shall be called water holy even
[48:06] everyone that is written among the
[48:08] living in water
[48:09] so this is going to be the condition of
[48:12] the women
[48:13] in the end time but there will be a
[48:16] different
[48:17] woman and that woman is going to be the
[48:20] bride
[48:22] she is in zion and the second type will
[48:25] be the hundred and forty four thousand
[48:27] and both the bride and the hundred and
[48:29] forty four thousand
[48:30] receive the same message because the
[48:34] seventh seal to the bride is the seventh
[48:37] trumpet to her
[48:39] ever clear so they're gonna behave
[48:41] differently
[48:43] let's go to first timothy chapter one
[48:46] then we're gonna pray first timothy
[48:49] chapter 2.
[48:51] if you dare you can say amen
[48:56] i wish everybody was here so we can nail
[49:00] this one time
[49:02] he came from the hair and he opened up a
[49:04] different aspect to
[49:05] clean up something a territory of the
[49:08] black dog
[49:09] somebody was slacking on the
[49:11] responsibility
[49:13] amen this is a preparation to the second
[49:17] banquet
[49:18] if you don't clean up all of this you're
[49:20] not going to be a candidate to the
[49:22] second banquet
[49:23] the second banquet is to remove a man
[49:25] completely out
[49:29] amen first timothy chapter two if you
[49:32] dare you can say amen
[49:34] verse one i exhort therefore
[49:38] that first of all supplication
[49:43] prayers intercession
[49:46] and giving thanks be made for all women
[49:52] why men why do we have to do all of this
[49:56] for men
[49:58] why why not women
[50:03] two four kings
[50:07] did they say queens did they say the
[50:11] queen
[50:13] for king's comer and for all that
[50:16] are in authority that we may lead
[50:20] a quiet and peaceable life
[50:24] in all godliness and water in other
[50:28] words
[50:28] pray for the people that are
[50:32] in the higher position pray
[50:35] for the people that hold the headship
[50:39] pray for the people that are the top
[50:43] because if your prayer goes for them
[50:46] you're gonna live a peaceful life if
[50:49] the head is bad it's a terrible things
[50:53] under them
[50:57] if the president is bothered the country
[51:00] is in trouble
[51:01] if the husband is bad the whole family
[51:04] is in trouble
[51:05] if that is bad the family is in trouble
[51:08] if the pastor is bad the whole church is
[51:12] in trouble
[51:12] that's why you pray for the heads
[51:19] is this a good thing verse 3 for this is
[51:22] god good and what
[51:26] acceptable in the sight of god hour
[51:30] so god loves it when you pray for your
[51:34] head
[51:36] who will have all women
[51:40] okay all men to be saved
[51:43] and to come to the knowledge of the
[51:45] water
[51:46] jump to verse nine in like manner also
[51:51] that women adorn
[51:55] themselves in modest apparel
[51:58] we explain this with shamefestness
[52:02] and sobriety not with breaded hair we
[52:06] explained this
[52:06] that was the prostitute on the other
[52:08] town or gold or pale or costlier
[52:12] but which becomes women
[52:16] professing these women are
[52:19] talking number one word
[52:22] professing godliness with
[52:25] water so these women they are not
[52:29] just talking about something but they're
[52:32] also
[52:32] manifesting the life of what they are
[52:35] talking
[52:36] it is word and deed amen
[52:41] but i suffered not a
[52:45] a woman to teach not to
[52:49] observe authority that's why in verse 1
[52:52] he said you pray for the man
[52:54] you understand now and observe authority
[52:58] not the word exercise authority
[53:00] over the water because from the garden
[53:03] of eden
[53:04] he shall be the ruler make sense
[53:09] so paul stays consistent amen
[53:12] exert authority over the men but be
[53:16] in silence verse 3 13
[53:19] for adam was what we saw this on sunday
[53:23] remember
[53:24] adam was first formed kama then
[53:29] we know that eve came after the fall
[53:31] that word eve
[53:32] remember on sunday amen
[53:36] and adam was not deceived
[53:39] we understand why the devil have to go
[53:41] there it's a wicked person
[53:42] but the woman being deceived was in the
[53:46] transgression remember in the garden of
[53:49] eden
[53:50] motherhood was given to her look what
[53:53] paul is going to say
[53:55] verse 4 15 not withstanding
[53:59] she shall be what in doing what
[54:03] everybody clear so far you see that
[54:05] child bearing again
[54:07] back again here motherhood conception in
[54:10] childbearing
[54:12] if they continue in water
[54:16] so you must stay in the faith and
[54:19] charity and holiness with water
[54:24] the key here the woman in the garden of
[54:26] eden responsibility
[54:28] conception motherhood childbearing
[54:31] her desire her want what she need
[54:35] she needs to go to her husband anybody
[54:38] clear
[54:39] man was work to bring bread
[54:42] but according to isaiah 4 there is a
[54:45] prophecy
[54:46] that women are doing producing their own
[54:49] bread
[54:50] and taking care of themselves they don't
[54:52] need the man they just need the man for
[54:54] covering
[54:56] to remove the reproach but there will be
[55:00] a different woman
[55:01] with the wisdom of the end time that's
[55:04] going to be different because she will
[55:06] have a message
[55:08] that's gonna make her behave different
[55:10] anybody clear
[55:12] let's pray heavenly father lord we thank
[55:15] you again for your grace
[55:16] your love your mercy and for everything
[55:18] you're doing for us
[55:20] father thank you for giving us another
[55:23] opportunity to gather together
[55:24] around the revealed word of the hour
[55:27] lord i have done
[55:28] what any man can do on this planet earth
[55:31] lord
[55:31] if they have an ability to do so but
[55:34] lord father to come
[55:36] break the word and unfold it you're the
[55:38] only one that can do it
[55:40] lord i'm surrendering myself and this
[55:42] church
[55:43] even those that are streaming unto the
[55:45] hand may the holy spirit come and
[55:48] minister to your children may you move
[55:50] me completely out of the way lord
[55:52] may the devil be sealed out and his
[55:55] devil
[55:56] lord and and his demon angel
[55:59] but may only the holy spirit lord be
[56:02] sealed and shut in this place
[56:04] that you can speak to our soul give us a
[56:07] revelation
[56:07] i'll rebuke every demonic spirit of
[56:10] resentment
[56:11] or that's going to bring a slickness of
[56:13] your own on your children
[56:14] in the name of jesus christ amen
[56:19] god bless you all we are in part 34
[56:22] dealing still with the air on
[56:26] sunday we showed you the different
[56:29] level we say that the top was crust
[56:33] and crust and gold are the same and
[56:35] crust is the chief
[56:37] shepherd and the shepherd is a pastor so
[56:40] that's why we put it there the chief
[56:41] pastor
[56:42] we're talking about the hair to the
[56:44] woman why is it bad
[56:46] then we talked about the messenger being
[56:48] the pastor of the age
[56:50] we demonstrated to you on sunday then we
[56:53] showed that the pastor
[56:54] is also an elder he's the head of the
[56:57] church
[56:58] and when he come to home either he's
[57:00] going to be your husband if you're
[57:01] married
[57:02] or he's going to be your father amen if
[57:05] you are still under your father
[57:07] or your legal guardian just like he was
[57:09] for esther
[57:10] with mordecai amen and when the bible
[57:13] says that a woman must wear
[57:15] a son on her head about
[57:18] showing a son that she's under power or
[57:22] under
[57:22] authority of the angels brother branham
[57:25] explained to us
[57:26] that the word angel means man and he
[57:29] showed that the
[57:30] man was a messenger which we
[57:33] demonstrated to you that
[57:34] that man is the messenger to the edge to
[57:37] the local pastor
[57:39] and then your husband or your father
[57:40] depending on where
[57:42] you are then we showed you that that
[57:44] authority
[57:45] or the position that was given to man
[57:48] was not a position just to be spoken
[57:52] or to be a position of a proud or just
[57:55] to brag about it
[57:56] it was a position that goes with
[57:59] responsibility
[58:00] and not only responsibility it is a
[58:03] position
[58:04] that must be used with respect and
[58:07] sacredness because being the head
[58:09] does not give you the authority to abuse
[58:12] the woman
[58:13] that's why paul says that with the
[58:15] authority
[58:16] that the lord have given us not to
[58:19] destroy
[58:20] but the authority was given to build up
[58:23] everybody clear
[58:24] that's where we stop and let's go to
[58:26] first peter
[58:27] chapter five
[58:32] i skip this but i cannot skip
[58:36] first peter chapter five if you dare you
[58:38] can say amen
[58:41] blessed be the name of the lord first
[58:44] peter chapter five
[58:46] verse one we're talking about the
[58:48] position
[58:49] that was given was not given for abused
[58:53] it was given for building up
[58:57] to the local pastor everybody clear
[59:01] the elders everybody there
[59:04] which are among you a pastor is an elder
[59:09] i exhort whom i
[59:12] also an elder and a witness of the
[59:16] suffering of christ
[59:18] and also a partaker of the glory that
[59:21] shall be revealed
[59:22] so not only am i suffering but if i
[59:24] suffer i'm gonna be also be partaker
[59:27] of that glory amen verse two
[59:30] feed the flock of god the church
[59:34] which is among you an elder a pastor
[59:38] feed the flock of god which is among you
[59:42] taking the oversight thereof
[59:45] not by water not by
[59:48] constraint in other words not like
[59:50] somebody
[59:51] is forcing you amen it must be
[59:55] a pleasure for a pastor to take
[59:58] responsibility for the sheep
[1:00:02] they should not force a pastor into the
[1:00:05] office
[1:00:06] when a pastor is in the office and
[1:00:09] trouble is going on in the church
[1:00:11] it's gonna be a pleasure for that pastor
[1:00:15] to handle that because god already
[1:00:17] equipped him from the task
[1:00:20] amen you cannot call a pastor and then
[1:00:22] he's like oh my god what am i gonna do
[1:00:24] no if you're a real pastor
[1:00:26] amen it's not gonna be that they're
[1:00:28] forcing you it's a pleasure you have
[1:00:30] been built for it
[1:00:32] amen paul says
[1:00:35] peter says not by constraint but how
[1:00:39] willingly because you're an elder not
[1:00:42] for
[1:00:42] filthy lucra not for money
[1:00:46] you're not doing the job of a pastor
[1:00:48] because he pays money
[1:00:50] no it is a calling amen
[1:00:53] not for filthy look but of a ready
[1:00:57] man a willing man you have that heart
[1:01:01] to serve amen when they call you
[1:01:04] that somebody is in need automatically
[1:01:07] you engage without even understanding
[1:01:09] you already there
[1:01:10] it's not a burden somebody will say wait
[1:01:12] a minute he's working too much
[1:01:14] no it's just him amen
[1:01:17] verse three now neither as being water
[1:01:22] god even though you the head of the
[1:01:24] church
[1:01:25] you cannot be like a dictator
[1:01:31] position not for abuse
[1:01:35] are you there not neither
[1:01:38] as being lord over god's word
[1:01:42] so that church does not belong to the
[1:01:45] pastor
[1:01:47] the church is the heritage of the lord
[1:01:51] they gave you responsibility watch how
[1:01:54] you handling them
[1:01:56] anybody clear but being water
[1:02:01] example to the in other words
[1:02:04] lead them by life anybody clear
[1:02:09] and when the who you see the pastor now
[1:02:14] that's the top pastor who is up there
[1:02:16] when the chief
[1:02:17] shepherd shall appear you shall receive
[1:02:21] a crown of glory
[1:02:22] that faith is not her way why
[1:02:26] because you have been treating his
[1:02:28] heritage with respect
[1:02:30] and with honor everybody here but god is
[1:02:33] saying here that if my god
[1:02:35] bless is a pastor that pastor should not
[1:02:38] be
[1:02:39] ruling the church like a king
[1:02:45] mark chapter 10 verse 42 but
[1:02:49] jesus called them to him and say unto
[1:02:52] them
[1:02:53] ye know that day which are
[1:02:56] a content to rule over the water
[1:03:01] hidden pagan when a pastor
[1:03:05] ruled the church like a dictator he is
[1:03:09] actually ruling the church like a pagan
[1:03:13] like a gentile like an unbeliever
[1:03:21] to rule over the gender exercise water
[1:03:25] god said here do not be lords over them
[1:03:29] those are the gentle way exercise
[1:03:32] lordship over them
[1:03:33] and their great one exercise what
[1:03:37] authority upon them is a wrong kind of
[1:03:40] authority
[1:03:41] but socially not be among you in other
[1:03:45] words
[1:03:45] i don't want you to copy the way the
[1:03:48] gender
[1:03:49] handle the people that's why when israel
[1:03:53] said
[1:03:53] we want to have a king like the other
[1:03:56] nation
[1:03:57] samuel got angry god got angry
[1:04:01] because you want to copy the ways of the
[1:04:04] pagan
[1:04:05] the way of the unbeliever the way of the
[1:04:08] hidden
[1:04:08] but i want you to separate completely
[1:04:11] from the kingdom of the heathen because
[1:04:14] my kingdom
[1:04:15] is not from this world my kingdom is
[1:04:18] from above
[1:04:20] anybody clear but so shall it be
[1:04:23] not among you but whosoever will be
[1:04:26] great the head among you shall be a
[1:04:30] water
[1:04:30] in other words the attitude of a pastor
[1:04:34] should be a servant the attitude
[1:04:37] of a supervisor is willing to come and
[1:04:40] step down and help you up
[1:04:42] the attitude of a father he should be
[1:04:46] a servant the attitude of a husband
[1:04:49] should be a servant the head is not a
[1:04:52] lord
[1:04:55] the only lord and savior is the lord
[1:04:57] jesus christ
[1:04:58] because the head of all men everybody
[1:05:01] creates so far
[1:05:03] and whatsoever shout of you
[1:05:06] will be the water the top shall be the
[1:05:09] water
[1:05:10] so if you want to be the top just
[1:05:12] remember you cannot be the top with a
[1:05:15] caring servant
[1:05:16] the more you want to climb out just
[1:05:18] remember pick up the word servant
[1:05:20] if you don't want to be servant so we
[1:05:22] cannot give you that top position
[1:05:27] amen and whosoever of you will be the
[1:05:30] chiefest
[1:05:31] shall be servant of all for even the who
[1:05:36] god himself came not to be what
[1:05:40] minister aren't you but to do what and
[1:05:43] to give his water
[1:05:45] as a ransom for what they had
[1:05:48] the quality of a headship is
[1:05:52] somebody who is ready to deny
[1:05:55] himself somebody who's
[1:05:58] ready to give himself as an offering
[1:06:06] as nothing somebody who's ready to
[1:06:09] dedicate himself
[1:06:11] anybody care somebody who's willing to
[1:06:14] serve
[1:06:15] that's the key for a pastor not
[1:06:19] somebody who's after money looker
[1:06:22] not somebody who they're gonna push him
[1:06:24] because they think he need to be the
[1:06:26] pastor
[1:06:27] that's not it that's carnal
[1:06:30] that's amen because i'm dead i feel i
[1:06:34] believe this one should be here and they
[1:06:35] just put it
[1:06:36] because it's the pastor amen
[1:06:39] blessed be the name of the lord
[1:06:42] colossians 3 verse 18
[1:06:45] wives submit yourself unto your owner
[1:06:49] your owner your owner
[1:06:55] as it is fit in the water so in the lord
[1:06:59] god wants you to submit yourself to your
[1:07:02] husband

[1:08:02] lest there be water if they discourage
[1:08:05] you are not building up anymore your
[1:08:08] power
[1:08:09] was given to build up now your power
[1:08:12] is a destructive power and a destructive
[1:08:15] power
[1:08:16] reflect the kingdom of satan because the
[1:08:19] enemy comes to kill
[1:08:21] to steal and to do utter you are
[1:08:24] destroying your own heritage
[1:08:26] that's the devil
[1:08:29] the devil take his children bring them
[1:08:33] to steal something
[1:08:34] and the same devil called the police and
[1:08:37] catch the children
[1:08:38] and put them to prison the same devil
[1:08:41] he's not building up his children
[1:08:43] he's there to destroy his children
[1:08:46] because his makeup
[1:08:47] is to destroy but you have been given
[1:08:51] authority
[1:08:52] not to destroy but authority to build up
[1:08:59] it is not just marriage and sex
[1:09:02] it goes beyond that
[1:09:08] servant come on obey enough fix your
[1:09:12] water
[1:09:13] why according to the
[1:09:16] not without service not hypocrite when
[1:09:19] they're there you do
[1:09:21] when they live there
[1:09:25] as men pleasers but in singleness of
[1:09:29] heart
[1:09:29] genuine fearing your master
[1:09:34] your position your gps is god
[1:09:38] i'm respecting my husband with my gps in
[1:09:41] god
[1:09:42] i'm respecting my boss with my gps in
[1:09:46] god
[1:09:48] and whatsoever you do do it
[1:09:52] hurtly as to the water
[1:09:55] do you see what kind of stuff we do at
[1:10:00] work
[1:10:02] if they tell you jesus need that package
[1:10:04] how are you going to package it
[1:10:07] and not unto men knowing that of the
[1:10:11] lord
[1:10:11] you shall receive the water remember
[1:10:14] paul just told the shepherd
[1:10:16] that if you take care of the flock of
[1:10:19] god good you shall receive
[1:10:21] a reward a crown of glory now he's
[1:10:23] telling
[1:10:24] here those that are worker he said you
[1:10:26] shall receive
[1:10:27] the reward of the inheritance for he
[1:10:30] served the lord christ
[1:10:32] but he that do wrong shall receive for
[1:10:36] the wrong which he has done
[1:10:38] and there is no respect of the water in
[1:10:41] other words
[1:10:42] no no judgment not this is big or not
[1:10:45] everybody is going to be treated
[1:10:46] equally everybody clear so far let's go
[1:10:49] to ephesian five
[1:10:52] it's a position it's a great position
[1:10:56] it is not a position like you thought
[1:10:58] before
[1:10:59] it's a position that is big because it
[1:11:02] goes with responsibility
[1:11:05] it's not a position to give command all
[1:11:07] the time
[1:11:09] it's not just about command he goes with
[1:11:12] a burden
[1:11:13] with a responsibility amen
[1:11:17] let's go to ephesians chapter 5 verse
[1:11:20] 22.
[1:11:21] let's get to our subject now amen
[1:11:26] for the husband is the head of the wife
[1:11:30] everybody understand now here let me go
[1:11:33] back
[1:11:33] to 22. wife submit yourself to your
[1:11:37] honor this is ephesian that was
[1:11:39] colossian
[1:11:40] you see how the consistency of the
[1:11:42] scripture goes
[1:11:43] amen one to uh submit yourself
[1:11:49] to your husband as to the water remember
[1:11:52] the gps
[1:11:53] you doing it but as to the lord you do
[1:11:56] it service to your boss
[1:11:57] as to the lord
[1:12:01] amen not that your husband is your god
[1:12:06] amen verse 23 for the husband
[1:12:10] is the head of the wife even as
[1:12:14] christ is the head of the water remember
[1:12:17] over there
[1:12:18] we already explained to you the top head
[1:12:20] is crossed the husband is right here
[1:12:23] amen and he is the
[1:12:26] savior of the body because the head came
[1:12:29] in sunset mountain
[1:12:30] the body is the brain about here verse
[1:12:33] 24
[1:12:33] therefore as the church which is the
[1:12:37] wife of christ
[1:12:38] is subject to christ so let the wives
[1:12:43] be to their own husband in every thing
[1:12:47] the natural woman always
[1:12:50] reflect the condition of the church
[1:12:55] you follow me your behavior as a sister
[1:12:59] it shows which church you belong to
[1:13:04] if you belong to the bride of jesus
[1:13:06] christ
[1:13:08] the spirit of the bread is the holy
[1:13:10] ghost
[1:13:11] that holy ghost will make you respect
[1:13:14] and obey your husband but if you
[1:13:18] are only in the building if you are
[1:13:21] only in the setting of the message
[1:13:24] but you are not baptized into christ
[1:13:27] you want to reflect a different woman
[1:13:31] you want to reflect the woman of jezebel
[1:13:35] even though you sit in the message
[1:13:37] church
[1:13:38] that's why we must get in christ
[1:13:45] hallelujah
[1:13:48] let the wife be to their own husband
[1:13:52] in water in what
[1:13:56] everything why because your desire
[1:14:01] makes sense shall be brought to who
[1:14:06] let's go slowly and no question my papa
[1:14:08] what about if he tells me to kill
[1:14:10] somebody
[1:14:12] relax amen
[1:14:16] verse 25 husband not for abuse remember
[1:14:20] his authority not for abuse he cannot
[1:14:23] tell you to go kill somebody
[1:14:26] that's an abuse of authority husband
[1:14:30] do what love your wife remember
[1:14:33] colossians
[1:14:34] love your wives even as
[1:14:37] who also love the water
[1:14:42] and gave himself for what
[1:14:45] the way a husband
[1:14:48] should love his wife that's why i say i
[1:14:51] wish the whole church was here
[1:14:52] the way her husband should love his wife
[1:14:57] is that a husband must be able
[1:15:00] to give himself for his life
[1:15:06] i'm reading the scripture
[1:15:09] you want to get married praise the name
[1:15:13] of the lord
[1:15:14] verse 26 that he might do water
[1:15:19] sanctify and do what and
[1:15:22] cleanse it with the washing of the water
[1:15:26] by the water
[1:15:27] in other words the personal care
[1:15:30] of a woman
[1:15:35] this woman is the brother she's the
[1:15:38] bride of jesus christ
[1:15:39] jesus christ when he loved his wife he
[1:15:42] gave himself for his wife
[1:15:45] and then he takes his wife and wash his
[1:15:48] wife
[1:15:51] to remove every unclean thing from his
[1:15:54] wife
[1:15:55] the personal grooming of a woman
[1:15:59] is a responsibility of the man
[1:16:08] they tell you we need money to buy
[1:16:10] lotion you get upset
[1:16:17] personal care
[1:16:21] if you in that stage don't get married
[1:16:23] yet
[1:16:25] amen verse 26
[1:16:29] that he must sanctify and cleanse it
[1:16:32] with the washing off the water by the
[1:16:34] water
[1:16:36] watch crust you pick up a woman
[1:16:40] you give yourself for that woman you die
[1:16:43] for that woman
[1:16:44] you wash that woman what is the purpose
[1:16:47] you do in all of this
[1:16:49] why do you have to die for this woman
[1:16:52] why do you have to clean
[1:16:54] this woman up why do you have to make
[1:16:56] this woman look so beautiful
[1:16:58] for somebody else to see her
[1:17:02] for her to post herself on facebook
[1:17:05] for help to continually push herself
[1:17:08] every day on what's happened
[1:17:10] why do you clean up this woman
[1:17:15] christ can you give me your answer
[1:17:18] you ready verse 27 that he might do what
[1:17:23] present to you
[1:17:30] you understand when god fixes his wife
[1:17:35] he fixes his wife to fit his test
[1:17:41] do you follow me do you follow me
[1:17:44] do you follow me so the reflection
[1:17:48] of a woman shows the character
[1:17:51] of the man
[1:17:54] that's why brother branham said show me
[1:17:57] the woman you want to get married
[1:17:59] i'm going to tell you who you are
[1:18:03] do you understand me so when christ
[1:18:05] takes responsibility for his wife
[1:18:08] he prepared his own wife he beautify
[1:18:12] his own wife so that he can present
[1:18:15] his own wife to himself
[1:18:18] [Music]
[1:18:23] that he may present it to himself
[1:18:26] a water how can she be glorious
[1:18:31] so christ was doing work
[1:18:34] he was building up that church so that
[1:18:37] church become
[1:18:38] glorious amen not having water
[1:18:44] what a job not a slack job
[1:18:47] he was really taking care of detail
[1:18:51] you understand not having spot
[1:18:54] or wrinkle or any such thing
[1:18:58] but that should be how holy
[1:19:02] and without what verse 28
[1:19:05] so out man this is the way man
[1:19:09] should love the wife as their own water
[1:19:14] he the love of his wife loves his water
[1:19:18] because the church is the body of christ
[1:19:21] and this is the way christ treated his
[1:19:23] own body
[1:19:24] that's the same way a man ought to love
[1:19:27] his wife
[1:19:30] what are you up to brother stephen
[1:19:32] ezekiel chapter 16. you got it now
[1:19:37] you got it now you got it now god

[1:20:19] confidence with you

[1:30:57] i'm not there to get your property i'm
[1:30:59] not there to get your car
[1:31:02] paul amen sick not yours
[1:31:06] but you what i needed is you for the
[1:31:09] children ought not to do what
[1:31:12] to lay up for the water but the parent
[1:31:16] for the water
[1:31:17] it is a responsibility of the father
[1:31:20] to take care of the home what did we do
[1:31:25] we got our kids into job and we're
[1:31:28] splitting bills with the kids
[1:31:33] you see what we did we got our kids you
[1:31:36] got five kids you got four kids you got
[1:31:38] three kids
[1:31:39] this one is working this one is working
[1:31:40] this one is working and you
[1:31:42] as a father you relax and when the
[1:31:45] stimulus check is coming
[1:31:46] you're waiting for the stimulus check of
[1:31:48] the kids
[1:31:55] you see what is going on why my daughter
[1:31:57] is making so much money
[1:31:59] my son is making so much money it is to
[1:32:01] the parent
[1:32:02] to lay for the children
[1:32:06] 15 and i will very gladly
[1:32:09] not grudgingly gladly spend
[1:32:13] and be spent for what paul is saying i
[1:32:17] am
[1:32:17] ready myself to be sacrificed and i'm
[1:32:20] also ready to spend for you
[1:32:22] that's the responsibility of the head
[1:32:28] amen taking money putting in a pocket
[1:32:32] you don't have a building
[1:32:37] i hope you cut that hebrew 3 verse 4
[1:32:42] for every house is built by some woman
[1:32:50] can you read it with me
[1:32:54] every house is built by some
[1:32:58] everybody when you building a home
[1:33:03] man you are supposed to build your house
[1:33:08] not your wife your wife is now
[1:33:13] responsible
[1:33:14] to buy your house
[1:33:18] you are responsible to take care of her
[1:33:21] bread
[1:33:22] you are responsible to take care of her
[1:33:24] clothing
[1:33:25] you are responsible to take care of her
[1:33:27] shoes you are responsible
[1:33:29] for her personal care you are
[1:33:31] responsible for her passion
[1:33:33] you are responsible to provide a home
[1:33:37] for your family you demand not the woman
[1:33:40] because in hidden in eden that was your
[1:33:44] responsibility
[1:33:45] [Music]
[1:33:46] you want to be the head it goes with
[1:33:49] responsibility
[1:33:52] every house is built by some
[1:33:55] men but he that builds all things is who
[1:33:59] the man is under the authority because
[1:34:02] the head of men is who christ
[1:34:05] you understand now and the head of
[1:34:07] christ is who
[1:34:08] god even though he's building
[1:34:12] he's building under god
[1:34:17] a song of degree of for solomon except
[1:34:20] the lord built the house because he
[1:34:22] built nothing
[1:34:24] they never invented the water
[1:34:27] so before you build a house you go by
[1:34:29] god
[1:34:30] and god help you build the house but
[1:34:32] it's not the woman responsibility
[1:34:37] titus 2 verse 4 that they may teach the
[1:34:41] water
[1:34:44] can you read it the young women to be
[1:34:47] what
[1:34:49] karma to love their water these are
[1:34:52] women that are married
[1:34:54] okay come on to love their welcome
[1:34:58] that's their responsibility karma to be
[1:35:00] what
[1:35:02] you have a problem it's on facebook a
[1:35:05] problem with your husband on facebook
[1:35:07] all love for the country everybody knows
[1:35:09] about it
[1:35:10] you argue with your husband it's all
[1:35:12] over the message
[1:35:17] before you know it you even make video
[1:35:20] to explain people what happened
[1:35:21] your version of the story craziness
[1:35:26] to be discreet chest keeper of
[1:35:30] water who keeps the home
[1:35:33] who built the house
[1:35:40] keepers at home good obedient to their
[1:35:44] own water
[1:35:46] that the word of god be not water
[1:35:49] you are responsible to build the homer
[1:35:52] [Music]
[1:35:55] she is responsible to keep the house
[1:35:58] keepers of home
[1:36:02] so when she's out of the home
[1:36:05] what happened
[1:36:08] now we commend you brethren in the name
[1:36:11] of our lord jesus christ
[1:36:13] that ye withdraw yourself from
[1:36:17] every brother that walk how
[1:36:21] what does it mean if a brother worked
[1:36:23] disorderly quickly we say oh maybe he's
[1:36:26] chasing women
[1:36:27] or maybe he's stealing money let's see
[1:36:29] what that disorder means
[1:36:31] withdraw yourself from every brother
[1:36:34] that walks disorderly
[1:36:36] and not after the tradition which he
[1:36:38] received of us
[1:36:39] which tradition paul did you give to the
[1:36:42] church we go downtown
[1:36:44] for yourself know how he ought to follow
[1:36:47] us
[1:36:48] for we behave not ourself how paul is
[1:36:52] saying
[1:36:53] if a brother walk disorderly you need to
[1:36:56] withdraw from him
[1:36:57] because we the messenger we the ministry
[1:37:01] we didn't walk among you disorderly what
[1:37:04] does it mean to walk disorderly
[1:37:09] eight neither did we do what
[1:37:13] eat any man's water for water
[1:37:19] those ministers were not after the laity
[1:37:24] paul did the best to work with his own
[1:37:28] hand
[1:37:29] so he cannot be a burden to the believer
[1:37:34] because it's him who need to spend
[1:37:38] for the believer
[1:37:41] eat any man's bread for not but
[1:37:45] wrote with labor and travel
[1:37:48] night and what this is the apostle that
[1:37:51] we
[1:37:52] might not be water chargeable
[1:37:55] to any of you not because we have not
[1:37:58] water it is not that i don't have
[1:38:01] authority
[1:38:02] for you to pay me
[1:38:06] because the scripture says you shall
[1:38:08] never measure
[1:38:09] the ox that threaded the cone do you
[1:38:12] know what it means
[1:38:14] do you know what it means in other words
[1:38:16] you cannot tell
[1:38:17] somebody who work where they're making
[1:38:20] hamburger
[1:38:21] and french fries you cannot tell him not
[1:38:24] to eat french fries when he's hungry
[1:38:26] that's what the scriptures say because
[1:38:28] he's there watching food
[1:38:30] all the time he's gonna get hungry and
[1:38:33] you give him a restriction not to even
[1:38:35] touch french fries
[1:38:36] god said don't do that to a beast
[1:38:38] because the ox is shredding the corn
[1:38:41] and the corn is food but if you master
[1:38:44] his mouth
[1:38:45] you are killing him because he is
[1:38:47] tempted by that desire
[1:38:49] and you still quenching him god said
[1:38:51] don't do that it's cruel
[1:38:53] if he is working for you let him eat
[1:38:57] and god used that paul used that for the
[1:39:00] ministry
[1:39:00] and paul is saying that i have a right
[1:39:03] because i work for you
[1:39:04] you need to pay me but i didn't want to
[1:39:08] go that route
[1:39:10] i want to work to be an example to you
[1:39:13] [Music]
[1:39:14] because i'm the head
[1:39:18] anybody there not because we have not
[1:39:21] power
[1:39:22] but to make ourselves an example unto
[1:39:25] you da
[1:39:25] to followers for even when we were with
[1:39:28] you
[1:39:29] this we commend you what is the
[1:39:31] commandment that
[1:39:33] if any would not do what
[1:39:37] neither should be what
[1:39:41] that's said for the lord
[1:39:44] everybody here for we heal
[1:39:48] what do you people that there are some
[1:39:51] which work among you how what does it
[1:39:54] mean to walk disorderly paul
[1:39:57] walking disorderly working water
[1:40:01] not at all but what a
[1:40:04] brother who doesn't want to work he's
[1:40:07] there on the telephone busy body
[1:40:10] just talking about any other person
[1:40:12] thinks in the message
[1:40:14] he knows about his brother about his
[1:40:16] family about his family he doesn't want
[1:40:18] to go to work
[1:40:20] if you talk too much you need to find a
[1:40:22] customer service job
[1:40:24] where they're going to work you're going
[1:40:26] to talk and they're going to pay you
[1:40:30] you talking they don't pay you
[1:40:37] two hours on the telephone three hours
[1:40:39] on the telephone
[1:40:40] no pay go find a customer service job
[1:40:43] so at least you talk you satisfy your
[1:40:46] passion
[1:40:47] and they pay you
[1:40:54] now them that are such we command
[1:40:58] an exalt by our lord jesus christ
[1:41:01] that with quietness they work
[1:41:04] and and what eat their own water
[1:41:08] we want the man to work we don't want a
[1:41:11] man sitting in the church not working
[1:41:14] become busybody doing nothing that's not
[1:41:17] what man was giving as a responsibility
[1:41:20] amen as soon as something is wrong for
[1:41:24] your job
[1:41:25] as a man you should be looking for
[1:41:27] another job and praying for another job
[1:41:29] you cannot be relaxed while things are
[1:41:33] going down
[1:41:34] because by those we behave you this is
[1:41:37] why
[1:41:37] you get in trouble with your credit card
[1:41:41] because now you use credit card to
[1:41:43] compensate your bill because you don't
[1:41:45] want to work
[1:41:48] and you're waiting for stimulus check to
[1:41:50] pay off the credit card
[1:41:51] but you still don't have job and you're
[1:41:53] going to go back again to the same thing
[1:41:57] hallelujah amen
[1:42:01] so anyhow but oh my
[1:42:04] it is all right but you need a weakling
[1:42:07] man
[1:42:08] i am ashamed of you as a christian
[1:42:10] brother
[1:42:11] we let your wife do such a thing as that
[1:42:14] it shows what you are made out of that's
[1:42:17] right
[1:42:18] now women you ought to say amen
[1:42:21] after fasting at you like that because
[1:42:24] he is the water
[1:42:26] brother branham straightened the women
[1:42:29] but he turned around he said it is you
[1:42:31] the man
[1:42:32] you are the one that calls all of this
[1:42:35] remember on sunday that's right and the
[1:42:38] way
[1:42:39] he lets you leave it is his water
[1:42:43] god is going to hold him responsible for
[1:42:47] it
[1:42:47] that's right if you are men enough to
[1:42:50] take up
[1:42:51] and put your heart your own house in
[1:42:53] order god be
[1:42:54] merciful to you if you a man
[1:42:57] that is not buying bread for your home
[1:43:00] and you splitting bills for your wife to
[1:43:02] be paying the food
[1:43:04] put your house in order
[1:43:10] she's the one paying for the food i am
[1:43:13] the one paying for this
[1:43:14] if she gets sick
[1:43:18] who told you to split bills did they
[1:43:21] split it in hidden
[1:43:26] that's right because the bible says in
[1:43:28] the very beginning
[1:43:29] that he shall rule over thee now she's
[1:43:32] not
[1:43:32] a doormat now remember no abuse
[1:43:36] she is your sweetheart but you should
[1:43:39] sit down and talk to her
[1:43:40] and reason it with her and tell her and
[1:43:43] read the bible
[1:43:44] and pray together you see the man these
[1:43:46] things would not be
[1:43:48] in the church then if you don't water
[1:43:51] we should not even talk about it in the
[1:43:53] church we got away
[1:43:55] from the real thing amen
[1:43:59] listen here the man is the ruler
[1:44:03] don't you think you shall rule the house
[1:44:06] you are
[1:44:07] not sister the ruler of the house
[1:44:11] you are not a slave now not abuse
[1:44:14] he keep putting that you are but you are
[1:44:18] a helpmate remember on sunday
[1:44:20] now the man has the rule over his wife
[1:44:24] and he is responsible solely for his
[1:44:28] wife
[1:44:28] god makes the man answer for his water
[1:44:32] you're going to be answering what is
[1:44:34] going on in your home
[1:44:35] amen brother branham the bible tells us
[1:44:39] that a wife should obey her husband i'm
[1:44:42] a christian
[1:44:43] and my husband is a water a sinner
[1:44:46] he persecuted me in every way that he
[1:44:49] came
[1:44:50] and for me not to go to church and read
[1:44:53] my bible
[1:44:54] and deny the word what should i do
[1:44:59] we clear what should you do now
[1:45:03] listen you are supposed to obey your
[1:45:06] husband
[1:45:08] that is the word now if
[1:45:11] he tells you and refuse
[1:45:15] you to read the bible go to church or
[1:45:18] something like that
[1:45:19] you don't have to obey that that's an
[1:45:23] abuse
[1:45:24] of power
[1:45:28] because he that won't forsake his father
[1:45:33] mother husband wife or whatever it is
[1:45:37] and follow me is not worthy of mine
[1:45:40] no demand our support you are not a man
[1:45:43] is
[1:45:44] not supposed to use that authority
[1:45:47] over a woman just because he is a water
[1:45:51] no abuser hey
[1:45:54] god is her ruler above you brother

[1:47:40] from home
[1:47:41] don't you i say it's just a little shack
[1:47:46] but it doesn't take a bit a big house
[1:47:50] to make a home it is the character
[1:47:53] on the inside that make a home
[1:47:56] and i am thankful for a home
[1:48:00] i look around i hear somebody say isn't
[1:48:03] that
[1:48:04] a beautiful home i say i don't know home
[1:48:07] is not the house it is the order
[1:48:10] of the house that makes the water
[1:48:13] that is what makes home no matter if it
[1:48:17] is a
[1:48:18] chanting whatever it is if the order is
[1:48:22] right on the inside and godly
[1:48:25] it is more of a home than if you had a
[1:48:28] palace somewhere
[1:48:29] i rather live in a shanty and be happy
[1:48:33] than to live in the palace and be water
[1:48:36] the woman is responsible for the
[1:48:40] atmosphere of the home you're building
[1:48:43] your house you're building your home the
[1:48:46] husband take care of the building
[1:48:50] because brother brother said the beauty
[1:48:51] of a church is what
[1:48:53] the character of the water not the
[1:48:56] building the pastor take care of the
[1:48:57] building
[1:48:58] but the beauty of the church is taken
[1:49:00] care by the
[1:49:01] church itself by your life everybody
[1:49:04] here
[1:49:05] we pass down the street many times and
[1:49:08] we see a house and sometimes we say
[1:49:10] isn't that a lovely home now it might
[1:49:12] look like a lovely house
[1:49:14] but a home is the order of the water
[1:49:18] you see the order that is in it order
[1:49:21] off the water
[1:49:23] the order of the family who's
[1:49:25] responsible for that family under
[1:49:28] who's that fifth gospel a woman
[1:49:32] a woman is not meant to have an iron
[1:49:35] disposition
[1:49:38] she is according to the holy spirit of
[1:49:40] scripture
[1:49:41] to be submissive to the male that is
[1:49:44] commanded of her
[1:49:45] woman who is truly female or female
[1:49:49] will be at that disposition not a dorm
[1:49:52] but again
[1:49:53] back again not abuse no real man
[1:49:57] makes a female a dormant but she
[1:50:00] will want to be under authority and not
[1:50:04] rule over a man a man real is not
[1:50:07] supposed to abuse a woman
[1:50:09] and a normal woman automatically should
[1:50:12] be
[1:50:13] under submission that's why you have a
[1:50:15] tendency
[1:50:16] if your husband is driving with you who
[1:50:19] usually drive the car
[1:50:22] why
[1:50:25] you see what i'm saying you order your
[1:50:28] body respond
[1:50:29] automatically like that you can drive
[1:50:32] your kids
[1:50:33] if your husband said pick me up and make
[1:50:35] donna
[1:50:36] when he get there what do you have a
[1:50:38] tendency to do
[1:50:39] you leave the javascript why do you
[1:50:41] leave the driver's seat who told you to
[1:50:43] leave the jeopardy
[1:50:44] your body is recognizing that the head
[1:50:47] is there
[1:50:49] amen but if you want to drive your
[1:50:51] husband drive your husband drive your
[1:50:53] husband
[1:50:53] check it up sometime
[1:50:59] if she breaks that image that god
[1:51:02] made for her she is perverted
[1:51:05] any man that let a woman take authority
[1:51:09] has also broken that image and he is
[1:51:12] perverted both ways
[1:51:14] that is why a woman cannot wear that
[1:51:17] which pretends to a man
[1:51:19] or cut water
[1:51:22] your hair is more than just this
[1:51:25] protein she is never to wear garments
[1:51:29] that you turn to a male or cut her hair
[1:51:32] when she does she is intruding
[1:51:35] into the male domain taking authority
[1:51:39] and preventing water you think you are
[1:51:42] driving your home
[1:51:43] you think you are taking authority over
[1:51:45] your husband you just preferring
[1:51:46] yourself
[1:51:49] and when a woman invades the pulpit
[1:51:53] which is which she is commanded she must
[1:51:56] not do
[1:51:57] she shows what spirit is off she is off
[1:52:00] being a dominating female is water
[1:52:04] can i repeat it again being a dominated
[1:52:07] female is water
[1:52:09] and the seed of the roman catholic
[1:52:13] church
[1:52:13] are in her though she may deny this ever
[1:52:18] so vehemently
[1:52:20] that's why when the woman the vice
[1:52:22] president
[1:52:23] becomes a woman it is telling you
[1:52:27] who is getting into the united states
[1:52:31] when the president stands there and
[1:52:33] behind him
[1:52:35] it is the vice president and uh what's
[1:52:38] her name again
[1:52:41] nancy pelosi two women behind the man
[1:52:45] it is telling you we under a perversion
[1:52:49] in the country and that is the seed for
[1:52:52] the roman catholic because he loves that
[1:52:55] you are just attracting the roman
[1:52:57] catholic by
[1:52:58] putting a woman on top of the position
[1:53:02] it is not just things happening but
[1:53:04] modern events
[1:53:06] are made clear by white
[1:53:09] i have a few minutes and let me drive
[1:53:11] this why
[1:53:13] are these men called angels you ready
[1:53:17] we know at the beginning god was the
[1:53:19] seventh spirit
[1:53:21] you know that better than god in more
[1:53:24] faith
[1:53:25] and become visible as a pillar of fire
[1:53:28] and that pillar of fire was called
[1:53:30] christ which is the son of god the logos
[1:53:34] then from that pillar of fire god
[1:53:36] condescended again
[1:53:38] and become man in the man jesus christ
[1:53:41] everybody clear so far then after the
[1:53:43] death
[1:53:45] of and the resurrection of jesus christ
[1:53:47] because he went on the cross
[1:53:49] first of all he went into the river
[1:53:51] jordan and that pillar of fire
[1:53:53] was immorphed into a doth and the dove
[1:53:57] entered the lord jesus christ because in
[1:53:59] him do i left the fullness of the
[1:54:01] godhead how
[1:54:03] badly then from there he went to
[1:54:05] gethsemane
[1:54:06] in gestamine the pillar of fire left him
[1:54:09] that's why he was crying
[1:54:11] my father my father why have that
[1:54:13] forsaken me because the father
[1:54:15] took off everybody clear then he went to
[1:54:18] the cross
[1:54:19] and at the cross he died after he died
[1:54:22] he resurrected again
[1:54:23] on the day of pentecost he came back and
[1:54:26] did what
[1:54:27] poor himself why because everything that
[1:54:30] was in god he poured that into water
[1:54:32] and everything that was in christ he
[1:54:34] poured that into water
[1:54:35] the pillar of fire came and broke down
[1:54:38] into pieces
[1:54:39] entered the children of god because
[1:54:40] jesus was the temple of god
[1:54:42] and we the church become the temple of
[1:54:45] god
[1:54:46] everybody clear so far now when you look
[1:54:49] at this
[1:54:50] the one who came out from god was a man
[1:54:55] when he was made flesh he became a man
[1:54:59] the only time he changed is when he went
[1:55:02] to
[1:55:03] the uh to the upper room then he get
[1:55:06] into his brother
[1:55:08] but from here it is man man man
[1:55:11] then class being poured into the church
[1:55:13] which is the broad then he become a
[1:55:15] woman which don't become a woman
[1:55:18] everybody cares so far brother branham
[1:55:21] now
[1:55:21] if the church of the living god camera
[1:55:24] which is the weapon
[1:55:26] the pillar of the truth that's the
[1:55:28] church
[1:55:30] god intended this church to be powerful
[1:55:32] church brother kelly
[1:55:34] a glorious church a church that the
[1:55:37] whole world could look upon
[1:55:40] as the bride of christ well accepted
[1:55:44] in his past and to live in such an
[1:55:47] atmosphere
[1:55:48] and conduct itself in such a way god
[1:55:51] will be proud of this church
[1:55:53] to present it to who god fixing the
[1:55:56] church to present it to himself
[1:55:58] at the coming of the he should live
[1:56:01] in that characteristic in the church and
[1:56:05] he shall be living
[1:56:06] that way that is the church a reflection
[1:56:09] of christ
[1:56:09] everybody clear so far now brother
[1:56:12] branham says
[1:56:13] that this condensation here is called
[1:56:17] the regular line it is in the message
[1:56:20] who is this melchizedek
[1:56:21] anybody clear so far now when
[1:56:24] god created adam what i want you to
[1:56:28] remember here
[1:56:29] god left the spirit eternal god
[1:56:33] and in warfare into a theophany
[1:56:36] which is the logos you already know that
[1:56:39] then god
[1:56:40] left the logos and he muffled into flesh
[1:56:44] which is the lord jesus christ then god
[1:56:47] went at the cross and pierced
[1:56:50] him on the right on the left side and
[1:56:53] the poor
[1:56:54] blood water and the spirit came up
[1:56:57] and came out on the day of pentecost now
[1:57:00] god
[1:57:00] enter a woman which is a church number
[1:57:04] one
[1:57:04] is the spirit two is the lord god so the
[1:57:07] theophany
[1:57:08] three is the flesh fourth is in this
[1:57:11] bread
[1:57:12] everybody clear spirit theophany
[1:57:16] flesh bread everybody clear now when god
[1:57:20] created adam adam was first created
[1:57:25] in as a spirit because in genesis 1 27
[1:57:30] we found that on one sunday that when
[1:57:33] god
[1:57:33] created man he created men how
[1:57:38] male and water and female
[1:57:41] but when he put men in the flesh he was
[1:57:44] one man
[1:57:45] and that man was called who adam
[1:57:48] everybody here
[1:57:49] so when god created adam first adam was
[1:57:53] a spirit
[1:57:54] because god is also a spirit and those
[1:57:57] that worship him must worship him in
[1:57:59] spirit and in water
[1:58:01] praise the name of the lord normally
[1:58:04] adam
[1:58:04] should move from here into the theophany
[1:58:09] you follow me because when god created
[1:58:12] him
[1:58:12] he was both male and female so he should
[1:58:16] move completely
[1:58:17] from there all the way to the theophany
[1:58:20] but for some reason i don't miss that
[1:58:23] step
[1:58:27] you follow me you need coach you see me
[1:58:31] instead of adam being a morphe
[1:58:35] like god and enter his teopony
[1:58:39] adam by counter bypass
[1:58:42] his theophany and came from
[1:58:45] spirit all the way to flesh
[1:58:50] do you understand me then just
[1:58:53] like when he came on the flesh
[1:58:57] god made everything male female
[1:59:01] male female male female male
[1:59:04] female he spoke remember on sunday he
[1:59:06] spoke the elephant came male female he
[1:59:08] spoke
[1:59:09] the zebra male female but when he spoke
[1:59:12] adam on the earth
[1:59:13] adam came along and god left him alone
[1:59:16] and god realized that something wrong
[1:59:19] something was wrong with adam
[1:59:21] because everything was pale everything
[1:59:24] was male and female
[1:59:25] adam in the spirit already was male and
[1:59:28] female
[1:59:29] but on the flesh adam became alone
[1:59:32] that's why god said it is not good for
[1:59:34] men to be white
[1:59:36] and what god did he took adam just
[1:59:39] like he took jesus at the cross he peace
[1:59:43] jesus said the cross to bring the bread
[1:59:45] god also
[1:59:46] pulled from adam on the side a rib
[1:59:49] and he made what a woman he put adam to
[1:59:52] sleep
[1:59:54] amen and the sleep is a sight of a death
[1:59:56] a deep anesthesia
[1:59:58] and then he did the same to christ at
[2:00:00] the cross he put christ on death
[2:00:02] and he pulled eve amen and then from
[2:00:06] there
[2:00:06] god now want to enter his wife make
[2:00:09] sense
[2:00:10] now when eve was created if he has a
[2:00:13] long hair
[2:00:17] where do you get that now i want you to
[2:00:20] notice
[2:00:21] as we are moving on the holy spirit
[2:00:24] after brooding into man
[2:00:26] man come up what a beautiful thing he
[2:00:29] was
[2:00:29] and then god made the water
[2:00:33] now she was not in the original creation
[2:00:36] we explained that on
[2:00:37] sunday she is a what we explained that
[2:00:41] on wednesday
[2:00:41] on sunday she was a product of the
[2:00:44] product
[2:00:45] she is a by-product of a man i don't
[2:00:48] want to get started on that
[2:00:51] but she is a by-product of men then when
[2:00:54] she came
[2:00:54] into existence eve and she was the
[2:00:58] prettiest woman in all the world
[2:01:01] leader eve i can see her water
[2:01:05] hanging water where did you see her
[2:01:08] brother brother
[2:01:10] amen another thing that sons of god took
[2:01:15] daughters of men
[2:01:16] and did you know the bible never did not
[2:01:20] sex in angels
[2:01:22] there is no denoting of sex in angel
[2:01:26] and there is no place in the bible where
[2:01:30] there is a water
[2:01:32] because it started for men
[2:01:35] man man then when he get to the church
[2:01:39] god enter his bride
[2:01:40] that's why the angels when they appear
[2:01:43] to you
[2:01:44] they have a form of a man
[2:01:48] not a woman that's why a woman should
[2:01:51] not be a preacher
[2:01:53] the bible word there is a woman angel
[2:01:56] because a woman is a water
[2:01:58] a by-product of men and it shall
[2:02:02] all be the same like adam was both adam
[2:02:05] and eve to begin with
[2:02:06] she was taken from his water
[2:02:09] about here where are you heading now
[2:02:13] first corinthians for a man indeed ought
[2:02:16] not to cover his head
[2:02:18] for as much as he is the water and the
[2:02:22] water
[2:02:22] he's not just the glory he is the image
[2:02:26] and the glory of god when you see man
[2:02:29] you see god that's why the messenger
[2:02:33] should show you crust the pastor
[2:02:37] should show you crust daddy should
[2:02:40] display
[2:02:40] crust your husband should display quest
[2:02:44] every man should display christ
[2:02:47] pray for every man
[2:02:51] pray for the king because they are the
[2:02:54] reflection of the
[2:02:56] image and the glory of who
[2:02:59] that's why they need to cut their hair
[2:03:01] because they represent
[2:03:02] god but the woman is the glory of water
[2:03:08] not the glory of god and the bride
[2:03:11] being the wife of christ became the wife
[2:03:14] the become the glory of christ and
[2:03:17] christ
[2:03:17] had the glory of god which he said
[2:03:20] father
[2:03:20] glorify me with the glory i have with
[2:03:23] you before the foundation
[2:03:25] then he turned around he said my glory i
[2:03:27] give it to them
[2:03:28] now the bride begin to reflect the
[2:03:30] husband christ
[2:03:31] and your wife must must reflect you
[2:03:35] ever clear for the man is not of the
[2:03:39] woman
[2:03:40] genesis but the woman of the water man
[2:03:43] was created first
[2:03:44] then the pool the woman neither was the
[2:03:46] man created for the woman
[2:03:49] but the woman for the water created the
[2:03:53] woman
[2:03:53] to be a helpmate to adam remember sunday
[2:03:57] for this cause because of this
[2:04:01] ought a woman to have water
[2:04:04] power on her water a son of authority of
[2:04:08] her head
[2:04:08] which is her hair you understand now
[2:04:13] over here because of the water
[2:04:17] the word is what angel
[2:04:20] i'm almost heading to the airport
[2:04:22] genesis 18 verse 1
[2:04:24] and the lord appeared unto him in the
[2:04:27] plans of memory
[2:04:29] and he sat in the tent door at the heat
[2:04:32] of the day
[2:04:33] abraham and he lift up his eyes
[2:04:37] and look and lord there was water
[2:04:41] they were human when the angel came
[2:04:45] when god came to visit abraham with two
[2:04:48] angels
[2:04:48] both god and the angel looked like men
[2:04:54] not like woman stood by him
[2:04:58] and when he saw them abraham he run to
[2:05:01] meet them
[2:05:02] from the tenth door and bow himself
[2:05:05] toward the ground
[2:05:06] and say my water
[2:05:12] why did abraham call sarah my lord
[2:05:16] you getting there did anybody got it
[2:05:20] the bible says there were three men
[2:05:23] everybody three men
[2:05:27] they were not spiritual they were human
[2:05:30] but when abraham saw him he called this
[2:05:32] man wow
[2:05:37] now man is called lord
[2:05:44] and say my lord if i have found favor in
[2:05:47] that side
[2:05:48] pass not away i pray thee from that
[2:05:51] servant
[2:05:52] genesis 19 1-2
[2:05:55] this is 18 1-3 hey back here
[2:05:59] and there came how many angels
[2:06:03] on 19 they begin to describe us that not
[2:06:05] only were they men
[2:06:07] but they were what these men
[2:06:10] were angels
[2:06:17] i'm almost done and they came to angel
[2:06:20] because one stuck with abraham
[2:06:23] to sodom at even and lord sat at the
[2:06:26] gate of sodom remember abraham was at
[2:06:28] the ten door
[2:06:30] and lord seeing them rose up to meet
[2:06:33] them
[2:06:33] just like abraham did and he bowed
[2:06:36] himself abraham also by himself
[2:06:38] he bowed himself with his face to the
[2:06:40] ground abraham bowed himself to the
[2:06:43] ground
[2:06:44] and he said beyond my what
[2:06:47] why these these people calling human
[2:06:49] being lords
[2:06:52] angel i'll call how
[2:07:00] everybody clear praise the name of the
[2:07:03] lord
[2:07:04] likewise peter you wives
[2:07:08] be in subjection to your own water
[2:07:11] we seen it with paul in colossians and
[2:07:13] in ephesian
[2:07:15] that if any obey not the word
[2:07:19] any have a husband that is a sinner
[2:07:23] they also may without the word without
[2:07:26] preaching to your husband
[2:07:28] be won by the conversation the life
[2:07:33] of your wife so the life of a woman
[2:07:38] should bring a sinner to repentance
[2:07:41] let's go while they do what
[2:07:45] why they are observing you
[2:07:49] they're observing your chest life
[2:07:52] couple with what as a christian you must
[2:07:56] always keep respect
[2:07:59] we okay who's adorning
[2:08:03] let it not be the water
[2:08:08] this husband is a sinner
[2:08:11] he need to be saved peter is saying that
[2:08:14] if you take yourself and behave
[2:08:18] as a christian your christian life
[2:08:22] your inside life have more
[2:08:26] power on a man
[2:08:29] than what you're trying to do outward
[2:08:33] because remember the women the wrong the
[2:08:37] immoral women
[2:08:38] controlled by what beauty
[2:08:42] by sex and by what
[2:08:45] shape or form everybody clear
[2:08:49] now peter is saying if you want to gain
[2:08:52] your husband
[2:08:54] don't rely like the immoral woman
[2:08:58] don't control a man by your beauty
[2:09:02] because beauty will fade away don't
[2:09:05] control your man by sex he will get
[2:09:08] tired of it
[2:09:09] don't control man by your ship because
[2:09:12] you can gain weight don't become skinny
[2:09:15] it's going to change these are temporal
[2:09:23] whose adorning let it be not the outward
[2:09:26] adorning of playing of hell that was the
[2:09:28] immoral woman
[2:09:29] and the wearing of gold and putting on
[2:09:31] our peril but let it be the water
[2:09:36] use your power of a christian life
[2:09:39] to control the husband and it's not
[2:09:43] gonna be even
[2:09:44] you controlling him is going to be the
[2:09:46] holy spirit in you
[2:09:47] controlling him because greater is in
[2:09:50] you
[2:09:50] than he that is in the
[2:09:54] let it be the hidden man of the heart
[2:09:57] and that which is not water your form
[2:10:00] your beauty if you die
[2:10:02] it's corruptable all of these sex
[2:10:04] corruptable
[2:10:05] all of this shape corruptable if they
[2:10:08] put you on a casket it's all gone
[2:10:10] there is many of them in the cemetery
[2:10:12] amen
[2:10:13] even the ornament of the what a meek and
[2:10:16] water
[2:10:18] and a quiet spirit which is in the sight
[2:10:20] of the lord the water
[2:10:22] god is valuing more your life than what
[2:10:25] you're trying to impress your husband
[2:10:27] with
[2:10:29] for after this manner watch now
[2:10:32] in the old time the holy water
[2:10:38] a holy church women also who trusted in
[2:10:41] who
[2:10:43] not in themself the holy women put their
[2:10:47] trust in god
[2:10:48] not in themselves by their beauty they
[2:10:51] never put their confidence in their
[2:10:53] beauty
[2:10:54] they never put their confidence because
[2:10:56] they have a beautiful shape
[2:10:57] they never put their confidence in the
[2:10:59] sex but they put their confidence
[2:11:01] in god
[2:11:04] adorn themselves
[2:11:07] being in water they keep their respect
[2:11:11] unto the lord being in subjects and unto
[2:11:14] their own what
[2:11:16] even as who sarah obey who
[2:11:22] calling him what
[2:11:29] amen being called what
[2:11:35] you understand now calling him what
[2:11:39] lord whose daughter year
[2:11:43] as long as you do well and i'm not
[2:11:46] afraid with any water you have
[2:11:48] confidence in god
[2:11:50] you're not afraid of anything likewise
[2:11:53] your husband
[2:11:54] dwell with them according to knowledge
[2:11:57] giving honor
[2:11:58] unto the wife as unto a weaker water
[2:12:02] and as being ahead together
[2:12:05] of the grace of life that your prayers
[2:12:08] be not what do you see why some of your
[2:12:11] prayers are not going up
[2:12:14] do you see why do you see why
[2:12:18] a husband angel sarah what do you mean
[2:12:21] a man is an angel and they call angel
[2:12:25] lords that's why sarah said my lord
[2:12:28] my head my ruler
[2:12:32] when she said my lord he was telling
[2:12:35] abraham
[2:12:35] you my head you are responsible
[2:12:42] jesus wants to be supreme ruler of your
[2:12:44] life
[2:12:45] and the only way that he can bless you
[2:12:48] is when he become your water
[2:12:52] take the man give him his position
[2:12:55] he's gonna bless you a man by nature
[2:13:00] want to feel like he's under control
[2:13:04] that's the way god built him make him
[2:13:08] feel that way he's going to release
[2:13:11] everything
[2:13:12] if he feel that you are challenging him
[2:13:16] then you're gonna go into a marriage of
[2:13:18] a fight
[2:13:20] until you learn the hard way if you
[2:13:23] don't learn the hard way divorce
[2:13:26] because he will get to a point where he
[2:13:28] can't
[2:13:29] take it anymore he would rather go to a
[2:13:32] woman
[2:13:33] that is bad on the outside but i respect
[2:13:36] him
[2:13:37] versus sitting with you who always
[2:13:39] trouble him
[2:13:44] the only way he can bless you is when he
[2:13:46] becomes your what
[2:13:48] lord is what and what
[2:13:52] when sarah said my lord my angel
[2:13:56] you are my ruler you are my head
[2:13:59] you own me that's why i call you my
[2:14:02] husband
[2:14:07] who made you jesus who has a right to
[2:14:10] every press in your heart
[2:14:12] the creator have no secret before what
[2:14:15] open up your water a woman should have
[2:14:18] no secret toward his husband
[2:14:19] speak everything
[2:14:23] he already knows you to the detail what
[2:14:26] you're trying to hide
[2:14:28] but he wants to be more than a savior
[2:14:31] than your savior he wants to be your
[2:14:33] water
[2:14:34] lord is what ruler
[2:14:37] that is why the church gets in its
[2:14:40] lukewarm
[2:14:40] condition that's why you get in trouble
[2:14:44] you don't understand the headship and
[2:14:47] you head
[2:14:48] get in trouble because you don't
[2:14:50] understand that
[2:14:52] she is here with you together and your
[2:14:54] prayers
[2:14:55] are hindered by fighting each other in
[2:14:58] the marriage
[2:14:59] you are hindering your prayer the hair
[2:15:02] of a woman have a big deep mystery
[2:15:06] that's what we uncovered that is why the
[2:15:10] church get in its lukewarm condition
[2:15:12] it accepts christ as savior but not as
[2:15:15] water
[2:15:16] the women there say we're gonna eat our
[2:15:18] own bread
[2:15:19] we're gonna eat our own we're gonna have
[2:15:22] our own clothing
[2:15:23] but in other words we don't want your
[2:15:26] headship
[2:15:26] when you do that you block the blockage
[2:15:29] because that's the way god
[2:15:30] operates respect your husband recognize
[2:15:34] him even if he looks stupid to
[2:15:36] you do it as unto the
[2:15:39] lord because god say respect respect
[2:15:42] let god handle him and he's gonna fix
[2:15:46] that husband for you
[2:15:48] don't try to control him i just give it
[2:15:51] to him
[2:15:52] because i seen he got nervous you give
[2:15:54] it to him you know what i'm saying
[2:15:56] and tomorrow he's more nervous again
[2:15:59] it's not solving
[2:16:00] it is not sex it is not beauty there are
[2:16:04] women there that are more beautiful than
[2:16:06] you
[2:16:06] it is not this there is something a
[2:16:09] character that a man look he said yes
[2:16:12] that one is beautiful but what i have is
[2:16:14] a jew
[2:16:15] she cannot be compared to any that's
[2:16:17] what you want the man to beat your hand
[2:16:19] over
[2:16:20] amen christ want to be lord of your
[2:16:23] being
[2:16:24] to rule and guide you that is why he not
[2:16:27] set the heart
[2:16:28] to come in for that purpose is to be
[2:16:31] your spiritual guide
[2:16:33] and to be the ruler of your water
[2:16:36] the ruler of your well fair
[2:16:39] if you found out that the woman's head
[2:16:42] is her husband
[2:16:43] how many knows that the man's head is
[2:16:45] crushed therefore a man should cut his
[2:16:48] hair because of who
[2:16:50] because in him in christ was his both
[2:16:53] man woman and all his both father
[2:16:57] mother sister brother all but
[2:17:00] in man it's a masculine alone
[2:17:03] god expressed himself only like a man
[2:17:05] therefore he must cut off
[2:17:08] because of what christ but if the woman
[2:17:11] is a feminist shalom so he could have
[2:17:13] her
[2:17:14] covering her hair because her husband is
[2:17:16] over
[2:17:17] her he is her what
[2:17:21] he her lord means
[2:17:24] ruler that ruler goes with what
[2:17:29] abraham you are my lord you are my head
[2:17:33] you are my responsibility you are my
[2:17:35] responsible
[2:17:37] i am under your care when abraham
[2:17:40] understood that
[2:17:41] that's the way the old women adorn
[2:17:44] themselves before the husband
[2:17:46] they recognize the head the american
[2:17:49] spirit
[2:17:50] and the spirit of the world is against
[2:17:53] this christian principle
[2:17:55] it is a spirit that is taking the woman
[2:17:57] and pulling her
[2:17:58] as the head and you hear people say
[2:18:01] she is the one deciding you talk to a
[2:18:04] man my wife desired you talk to a man my
[2:18:06] wife desire you talk to a man
[2:18:08] she is my boss no according to the
[2:18:10] scripture
[2:18:11] you the boss she is your helpmate
[2:18:14] but that boss is not to abuse her that
[2:18:17] boss
[2:18:18] you are partner together you are working
[2:18:21] as a companion for life and working
[2:18:24] together
[2:18:25] so your prayer will be answered by god
[2:18:28] she respects you you love her and
[2:18:31] everything is there and god come
[2:18:33] and bless us because that's the couple
[2:18:35] god is looking for
[2:18:36] let's stand
[2:18:46] amen amen i went 17 minutes over
[2:18:50] i have to quench this so on sunday we
[2:18:53] get into another territory
[2:18:54] amen you understand here now you
[2:18:57] understand here now
[2:18:59] when you're cutting your hair sometimes
[2:19:01] you did it ignorantly
[2:19:03] it's a spirit and that spirit is only
[2:19:06] showing people that
[2:19:07] if if a man is christian you're telling
[2:19:10] god that you are not under authority
[2:19:13] that's what it means when you trim your
[2:19:15] head
[2:19:16] we manage it somebody else might not see
[2:19:19] it
[2:19:20] you do it yourself in your bedroom but
[2:19:22] the lord sees you
[2:19:23] you are rejecting authority authority
[2:19:26] might be your father
[2:19:27] authority might be your husband
[2:19:29] authority might be your legal guardian
[2:19:31] authority might be your pastor authority
[2:19:33] might be god himself
[2:19:35] if father is not there mother is not
[2:19:37] there a legal guardian
[2:19:39] is not there and nobody in the family
[2:19:42] you alone then automatically remember on
[2:19:44] sunday a widow
[2:19:45] and a divorce is under directly under
[2:19:47] crust
[2:19:49] because he is always there for you when
[2:19:52] everything fell when the pastor fell
[2:19:55] when the husband fell when daddy fell
[2:19:58] when the legal guardian fell
[2:19:59] there is one head that will never fail
[2:20:02] that head is always
[2:20:03] available because he told you i would
[2:20:05] never leave you nor forsake you
[2:20:08] submit to the head automatically
[2:20:11] listen to the head your marriage he's
[2:20:13] going to handle
[2:20:15] when you start putting these things in
[2:20:17] order the devil will try to fight you
[2:20:21] to show you that you see it's not
[2:20:23] working matter of fact it's causing
[2:20:24] trouble
[2:20:25] it is a test if you stick to it god will
[2:20:29] always watch over his word to confirm it
[2:20:32] and to support you you want god to back
[2:20:34] you up stay with his word
[2:20:36] because he always back up his word
[2:20:40] if you cannot meet the two
[2:20:43] bills in the mouth your wife is working
[2:20:45] we understand that brother brother gave
[2:20:47] us those things
[2:20:48] but always aim don't get comfortable
[2:20:52] always continue to pray you say god
[2:20:54] bless me
[2:20:55] so that i can be in order to your word
[2:20:58] god bless me
[2:20:59] because i don't want my wife to be
[2:21:01] working third shift and i'm sleeping at
[2:21:03] home
[2:21:03] you should be sleeping and your wife
[2:21:05] beside you
[2:21:08] you sleeping alone when you wake up
[2:21:10] she's coming
[2:21:12] you're going out she's coming in and you
[2:21:13] think it's normal
[2:21:16] that's not it i can nail more scripture
[2:21:19] here from the bible
[2:21:21] but i believe you got the point respect
[2:21:24] the head
[2:21:25] the head goes with responsibility take
[2:21:28] care of your wife
[2:21:29] let's use your paycheck pay her stuff
[2:21:32] don't let her own paycheck pay her own
[2:21:36] stuff
[2:21:37] it's it seems simple but it may have a
[2:21:40] meaning
[2:21:42] when a woman gets her paycheck she uses
[2:21:44] her paycheck she buys her own clothes
[2:21:46] her own thing
[2:21:47] you don't know what you're doing you are
[2:21:49] building something and someday
[2:21:51] a thought the devil it's not her the
[2:21:54] devil will come
[2:21:55] and tell her what does he do for you you
[2:21:58] work you pay your own thing he doesn't
[2:21:59] even give you money
[2:22:01] that's the devil because what a door was
[2:22:04] open
[2:22:05] so to quench that devil take your money
[2:22:08] put it in the bank account with you with
[2:22:10] him
[2:22:10] or whatever you do but let his money
[2:22:14] pay for your stuff when the devil comes
[2:22:17] you say you see this it's him you see my
[2:22:21] watch
[2:22:21] it's him you see this here it's him you
[2:22:24] see the shoes
[2:22:25] it's him he's the one taking care of me
[2:22:27] then he's locked
[2:22:28] but don't use yourself because when you
[2:22:30] go yourself and you develop
[2:22:32] independency you're going to go through
[2:22:34] isaiah 4.
[2:22:36] and it's it's the the devil operate only
[2:22:38] with
[2:22:39] ignorance that's why brother branham
[2:22:40] said to overcome
[2:22:42] is to recognize the devil in his tactics
[2:22:45] amen you can pay the two bills the
[2:22:48] husband is struggling you're trying to
[2:22:50] help
[2:22:50] fine keep that order it seems simple yes
[2:22:53] i need my
[2:22:55] underneath clothes you pay for it we
[2:22:58] need lotion
[2:22:58] you pay you use your own card to pay for
[2:23:01] it
[2:23:02] then god sees that i am the one paying
[2:23:04] for it the husband is holding there
[2:23:06] and the lord opened up the blessings it
[2:23:08] seems easy well it's the same money
[2:23:09] going over and over
[2:23:11] you are developing independence and when
[2:23:13] the devil will come to you because he
[2:23:14] came to the woman
[2:23:16] when he comes to you brother branham
[2:23:18] went through a strong trial
[2:23:20] and he says everything the devil was
[2:23:23] telling him was right
[2:23:25] except he could not tell him that he god
[2:23:28] doesn't exist
[2:23:29] so he nailed brother branham like look
[2:23:31] he doesn't love you
[2:23:32] look your wife dead look your child and
[2:23:35] brother branham was going like
[2:23:36] uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh until something
[2:23:39] speaks like wait a minute therefore i
[2:23:41] know he's there
[2:23:43] so when you do those kind of stuff when
[2:23:45] he come one day you're gonna see
[2:23:46] a word sleeping up what do you do to me
[2:23:50] and you don't understand where he came
[2:23:52] from he was building up slowly
[2:23:54] you didn't understand amen
[2:23:58] the man is responsible for the woman
[2:24:00] young people
[2:24:01] work hard work hard before you get
[2:24:05] married
[2:24:07] work hard let's pray heavenly father
[2:24:11] lord we thank you again for your grace
[2:24:14] for your love
[2:24:15] your mercy and for everything we're
[2:24:17] doing for you
[2:24:18] and you know everything you are doing
[2:24:19] for us father thinks much seems like
[2:24:22] it's impossible
[2:24:24] like it's difficult due to the age that
[2:24:27] we
[2:24:28] are living in father how can we believe
[2:24:31] a god that can split the water
[2:24:34] of the red sin too
[2:24:37] we talk about these things but many of
[2:24:41] us
[2:24:41] probably none of us has been at the red
[2:24:43] sea
[2:24:44] to see how the red sea looks and
[2:24:47] probably if you ask them a question
[2:24:49] do you believe i can split this water
[2:24:52] left and right
[2:24:54] and israel went under in the dry ground
[2:24:57] then we're going to realize how powerful
[2:25:00] you are
[2:25:01] regardless of the obstacle father that's
[2:25:04] what i want the church to understand
[2:25:06] regardless of what the country is
[2:25:09] regardless
[2:25:10] of what the circumstances and the
[2:25:12] difficulties are
[2:25:13] we can only take you extra word father
[2:25:17] you can do
[2:25:18] above everything that we can even
[2:25:21] conceive on things because you the god
[2:25:23] that is the same yesterday today and
[2:25:25] forever
[2:25:26] lord i know the devil will try to fight
[2:25:29] many of them
[2:25:30] trying to tell them that if you try to
[2:25:32] do this it's not going to work
[2:25:34] but this is the word of god obedience
[2:25:36] only will bring power
[2:25:38] because father you're gonna watch over
[2:25:40] your word father you need that branch
[2:25:43] that remaining branch that can express
[2:25:46] you completely in the pureness
[2:25:48] in the holiness father because that's
[2:25:51] what you're looking for
[2:25:52] to go to the rapture lord father i
[2:25:54] commit this sermon
[2:25:56] onto the hand i commit the heads of this
[2:25:59] church and to the hand i commit the
[2:26:01] husband and the young men
[2:26:03] i commit the sister unto the hand lord

[2:31:05] us
[2:31:06] before we go praise the lord
[2:31:11] i wanted to give it at the beginning of
[2:31:12] the church but i was late
[2:31:14] so um but
[2:31:17] this happened yesterday to me and
[2:31:20] it really kind of changed my perspective
[2:31:23] on
[2:31:24] things that i was going through so i was
[2:31:27] watching this movie
[2:31:29] and it was a christian movie but it was
[2:31:31] about this lady
[2:31:33] who been through like really rough
[2:31:34] patches in life
[2:31:36] and so she was trying to change
[2:31:39] and the people were praying for her and
[2:31:42] so
[2:31:44] she had trouble with fear and so they
[2:31:47] asked her
[2:31:49] they said ask the lord to
[2:31:52] show you where that fear began beginning
[2:31:55] your life
[2:31:57] and as soon as they said that i began to
[2:31:59] cry i just i broke down
[2:32:01] and i was just like oh my goodness
[2:32:02] because i've struggled with fear for a
[2:32:04] very long time in life
[2:32:06] and i was like where did it start from
[2:32:09] and i went it went all the way back
[2:32:12] you know to toddler age and i just broke
[2:32:15] down
[2:32:16] about everything about fear about
[2:32:19] resentment about
[2:32:20] doubt it was like it all stemmed from
[2:32:22] that place
[2:32:24] and so i just felt led to give a
[2:32:26] testimony of
[2:32:28] how god delivered me you know
[2:32:31] even when you're not expecting it god
[2:32:32] just
[2:32:34] is so good and we have to go back to
[2:32:38] where it started
[2:32:40] so i just wanted to give that testimony
[2:32:43] amen praise the lord amen
[2:32:45] praise the lord thank you lord amen
[2:32:49] thank you jesus amen as the dismissal
[2:32:53] prayer has already been made and we
[2:32:55] respond to the lord in our hearts just
[2:32:57] take the name of jesus with you we all
[2:32:59] dismissed
[2:33:01] amen take the name of jesus
[2:33:06] with you

[2:33:13] woe it will joy
