[41:49] enter into the fellowship of my
[41:51] my straight
[41:53] uh
[41:54] i never cease
[41:56] to
[41:57] tremble
[41:58] when i stand before god's children
[42:01] and i've had the privilege of standing
[42:03] before thousands at one time
[42:06] but
[42:08] i never get accustomed to it somehow or
[42:10] another
[42:11] you know there's only one thing that's
[42:13] more precious than the blood of the lamb
[42:16] and that's the purchase of that blood
[42:19] and when we stop and realize that it's a
[42:22] very sacred thing then to have
[42:25] the purchase of the blood in your in
[42:27] your hands and in your presence
[42:30] oh my
[42:31] i
[42:33] i don't want to start being critical
[42:36] for sure i don't want to start off on
[42:38] the wrong note because
[42:40] you know
[42:41] but i heard a minister the other day
[42:43] so-called in this message and he said
[42:45] the blood of jesus
[42:46] and the body of jesus wasn't divine
[42:50] yeah
[42:51] a great ministry in this message
[42:54] but see we get too far out and you leave
[42:56] the power of the blood
[42:58] you don't going too far
[43:00] and i was hearing them singing about the
[43:02] blood here tonight it just encouraged my
[43:05] heart
[43:06] amen
[43:07] amen we were not redeemed by corruptible
[43:09] things
[43:12] the silver
[43:14] oh man
[43:16] god created both the egg and the sperm
[43:18] in that virgin womb
[43:21] and
[43:22] it's actually the blood of
[43:24] jehovah amen that was
[43:27] poured out for us yes and then the life
[43:31] of that blood
[43:32] comes back upon the worshipper
[43:35] amen not just the chemistry but the life
[43:37] of that blood
[43:39] that's the token that we
[43:41] are
[43:43] desiring to manifest and express
[43:46] amen and possess
[43:49] tonight i just want to
[43:53] i was talking to brother tommy morris
[43:55] today on the phone and he said now bro i
[43:57] told him i said brother tommy pray for
[43:58] me i said i have no idea what i'm going
[44:01] to be preaching on tonight
[44:03] and i was honest i didn't i and i still
[44:06] don't know for sure
[44:08] so you know it takes the pull
[44:11] [Laughter]
[44:14] and so
[44:15] the letter killeth but the spirit giveth
[44:18] life
[44:19] and uh so
[44:20] we're here for you
[44:22] it takes
[44:23] you know
[44:24] having
[44:25] been brought up in the ozark mountains
[44:27] of arkansas very poor
[44:29] and we didn't even discover electricity
[44:31] there until i was 11 years old
[44:34] and
[44:35] i
[44:36] i don't glory in my poverty but i'm glad
[44:39] that i come up you know arkansas english
[44:42] is a lot like kentucky english
[44:44] and uh
[44:46] but
[44:47] having come up very poor
[44:51] we pulled the old two-man cross-cut saw
[44:53] to saw the
[44:55] wood to keep warm in the winter time
[44:57] and
[44:58] it takes two to pull it
[45:02] and that's kind of the way it is
[45:07] so
[45:09] i remember my big brothers would be on
[45:11] the other end of that saw it would be
[45:13] about six foot long you know
[45:15] and they'd be on the other end of that
[45:16] you know and i
[45:18] and uh
[45:20] they was longer legged and longer arm
[45:22] and stronger i was younger
[45:25] and
[45:27] i learned that they just wear you out
[45:29] they just
[45:30] kill you just about you know working
[45:32] that's all
[45:33] and so i learned if i put a little
[45:35] pressure on it when those pulling
[45:38] then it you know it it cut deep and then
[45:40] whenever it comes back my time i lift up
[45:42] on it a little bit
[45:46] don't be
[45:47] my older brother would say if you're
[45:50] going to ride that thing get a side
[45:52] saddle
[45:54] quit riding the saw
[45:56] so we don't want anybody riding the saw
[45:58] tonight
[45:59] you just pull okay
[46:02] it's not the third push it's the third
[46:04] pull
[46:06] and
[46:08] i come to get something from the lord
[46:10] tonight
[46:12] i want
[46:12] something amen and
[46:15] i'm certainly glad to have brother uh
[46:18] brother
[46:19] michael with me tonight brother mccandy
[46:22] i guess he's already been recognized
[46:25] but he's our um
[46:30] kind of like our head trustee and uh and
[46:32] then the first lady of the church my
[46:34] wife i'm glad to have her here
[46:40] tonight how many believes that god can
[46:43] still speak today
[46:47] when i was about
[46:49] 17 well 18 years old i
[46:52] i fell in love with i thought i i was
[46:54] infatuated with a little girl it was a
[46:56] preacher's daughter
[46:58] and she spoke in tongues and i thought
[47:00] if she was an angel
[47:02] and i thought surely that would be the
[47:03] one that i was supposed to marry
[47:06] and
[47:06] lo and behold when i sought the lord
[47:08] about it he gave me a scripture over in
[47:11] deuteronomy i believe it is somewhere in
[47:13] the there where it says
[47:15] that they couldn't
[47:17] draft a man into the israeli army
[47:21] for two years after he was married
[47:23] because he had to have that bonding time
[47:25] with his wife
[47:27] and so the lord gave me that scripture
[47:29] now
[47:30] i wasn't engaged to that little girl but
[47:32] i was sure inflatuated with her and i
[47:34] thought she was going to be my wife
[47:36] and so
[47:38] the
[47:39] when i sought the lord he gave me that
[47:41] scripture
[47:42] and i knew i was up for the draft i was
[47:45] mandatory draft i had to go into the
[47:47] military
[47:48] the vietnam war was pretty hot during
[47:50] that time
[47:52] must have been 65 1965
[47:56] and so
[47:58] i said well i knew that wasn't the will
[48:00] of lord for me to get married at least
[48:02] at that time
[48:04] and so to make a long story short by the
[48:06] time i got out of the military
[48:09] two years later
[48:10] my little dove had flew the coop
[48:13] she had done in a backslid and so forth
[48:17] and uh
[48:19] really
[48:20] oh i just tore my heart out
[48:23] i knew that was not god's program for me
[48:27] she has already got married and divorced
[48:30] and
[48:31] ready to remarry
[48:36] and her mother was determined that i was
[48:38] going to be the man that marry her
[48:40] but i knew that wasn't god's program
[48:43] and when i seen how near i had come to
[48:45] making the wrong decision
[48:48] now you young people listen to this
[48:50] boy or girl
[48:52] when i
[48:53] realized how close i had come to making
[48:56] the wrong decision on my own
[48:58] i made a vow to almighty god
[49:01] i said lord god you know my heart i'm
[49:03] not getting married period unless or
[49:07] until you speak to me
[49:11] with an audible voice
[49:14] and i know what you speaking
[49:16] and you'll have to tell me that's the
[49:18] one for me to marry
[49:21] now i'm not saying you have to do that
[49:23] i'm not suggesting you make that vow
[49:25] because there was many times i wish that
[49:27] i hadn't made the vow
[49:28] but i realized the importance of the vow
[49:31] and so i kept the vow by the grace of
[49:33] god
[49:38] that was in
[49:40] 67 that i made that vowel 1967
[49:44] and it wasn't until 1975
[49:48] that the lord spoke to me
[49:50] and i'm going to tell you how he spoke
[49:53] now like i said i wished a lot of times
[49:55] that i hadn't made that vow
[49:58] but i kept the vowel
[50:00] and the vowel kept me
[50:01] [Laughter]
[50:04] and
[50:04] so
[50:05] i thought well how am i going to know
[50:07] whether it's god's voice or the devil's
[50:09] voice because the devil's got a voice
[50:11] too
[50:12] he's a good counterfeiter
[50:17] and so
[50:19] but when i recognized the message in
[50:21] 1968
[50:23] right after getting out of the military
[50:25] and it wasn't too long after i made that
[50:28] bow
[50:29] then i started studying the message
[50:32] and hearing the voice of god for my day
[50:37] [Music]
[50:38] [Applause]
[50:40] you've heard brother branham speak of
[50:41] junior jackson
[50:44] uh brother junior jackson
[50:46] was i think it was the seventh dream uh
[50:49] before brother branham went west to open
[50:51] the seals you know
[50:52] and then it was capped off with a vision
[50:55] but
[50:56] uh brother jackson was over in prior
[50:58] oklahoma ministering he preached a
[51:01] message entitled royalty introduced
[51:04] and he was showing how jesus christ is
[51:06] royalty
[51:07] and he had a introduction at his first
[51:09] advent 2000 years ago and showed how it
[51:11] was scriptural john the baptist
[51:13] in the bible
[51:15] you know
[51:16] the voice of one crying in the
[51:17] wilderness
[51:18] and malachi 3 behold i send my message
[51:22] okay he said if jesus christ is the same
[51:25] hebrews 13 8
[51:28] if he's the same today
[51:30] and he's still royalty
[51:32] he still has to have an introduction
[51:35] and if he had a scriptural introduction
[51:38] at his first advent he'd have to have a
[51:40] scriptural introduction at his second
[51:42] advent
[51:43] and then he began to show the scriptures
[51:46] how i'd already heard two or three tapes
[51:50] but i had never seen brother branham's
[51:52] ministry in the scripture
[51:54] okay
[51:55] and brother junior jackson began to show
[51:58] malachi 4.
[52:00] revelations 10 7
[52:02] luke 17 30.
[52:04] oh my all these scriptures amen that
[52:08] identified the message of the hour
[52:11] in the bible
[52:12] hallelujah you've got to see this in the
[52:15] bible
[52:16] hallelujah because this is the
[52:18] revelation of jesus christ hallelujah
[52:22] hallelujah if you can read one verse of
[52:25] scripture in here and you don't see
[52:26] jesus christ you're instructed to read
[52:29] it again read it
[52:34] and then one day
[52:36] oh i was ministering up in
[52:39] that was actually in 68 that i first
[52:41] began to recognize the message but i was
[52:43] ministering way up in
[52:44] michigan and
[52:47] i met this little girl right back here
[52:50] well actually i first met her in
[52:51] jeffersonville at the brown tabernacle
[52:54] in 63
[52:56] but then later i had
[52:58] ministered for her her dad and they was
[53:01] having little services in their home
[53:02] actually there in
[53:04] lawrence michigan
[53:05] and
[53:07] i knew there was something special about
[53:09] that girl
[53:11] but i also remembered my vow
[53:15] and then
[53:16] so after two or three years i
[53:19] you know
[53:20] i i i said well i'm gonna have to tell
[53:22] her about my vow
[53:24] so i told her about my vow we had the
[53:27] opportunity to be alone
[53:29] and so
[53:31] i told her i said but now honey
[53:33] i didn't say honey
[53:35] but i said now if if god should show me
[53:39] everything
[53:40] if god should show me that you're the
[53:42] one for me to marry
[53:44] would you marry me
[53:46] she said well
[53:48] probably
[53:50] i said probably
[53:52] i i was wanting a more positive i was
[53:54] hoping for a more positive answer you
[53:55] know
[53:57] she said well well yeah if god told you
[53:59] you know that was the one you was you
[54:01] know i said well if he don't if he
[54:04] doesn't
[54:05] speak and show me that you're the one
[54:07] we wouldn't want it to happen anyway
[54:10] amen
[54:11] you wouldn't want it to happen now i
[54:12] wouldn't want it to happen
[54:14] so i said you pray i'll pray
[54:16] and we'll just see you know but at least
[54:18] i told her you know about the vow
[54:22] well it wasn't too long after that maybe
[54:25] a couple of weeks
[54:26] she wrote me a dear john letter i used
[54:28] to call it dear john
[54:30] god will never show you anything about
[54:32] me
[54:34] i'm just
[54:35] i'm not worthy to be your wife he would
[54:38] never show you anything about me to be
[54:41] your wife
[54:42] and it was three or four five pages long
[54:44] big long letter and it started out
[54:47] with a no and ended up with a no i'm
[54:49] just unworthy to be your wife
[54:52] well i thought
[54:54] what happened here i thought i had the
[54:57] maybe possibly the leadership of the
[54:59] lord or something here you know and
[55:01] and but boy this doesn't sound so i
[55:03] called her up on the telephone that's
[55:04] back in the olden days when you had to
[55:06] dial it up you know or bring it up
[55:09] and uh a telephone call back those days
[55:12] cost pretty good amount of money too
[55:15] so i called him from south carolina
[55:16] where i was already pastoring
[55:18] actually i pastored for two years before
[55:20] i was even married
[55:23] but anyway
[55:24] uh
[55:26] the uh
[55:28] when
[55:31] so
[55:32] i called her up from the church where i
[55:35] was actually living in the back of the
[55:37] church
[55:38] and um there in columbia
[55:41] and
[55:41] i i said now
[55:43] what about this letter you wrote
[55:46] always the same thing again
[55:49] and i thought well maybe she wasn't a
[55:50] virgin or something you know because she
[55:52] knew that brother branham said a
[55:54] minister supposed to marry a virgin
[55:56] and so i thought well
[55:58] maybe maybe it's possibility that but i
[56:01] always thought she was a
[56:02] well and when i tried to cross-examine
[56:04] her a little bit oh no brother hughes
[56:06] i've never known another man nothing
[56:08] like that i'm just unworthy to be your
[56:10] wife god will never show you anything
[56:12] about me
[56:13] i'm just
[56:14] unworthy well i thought
[56:18] okay you know it was after a long
[56:22] expensive telephone call it was still a
[56:24] no
[56:24] [Laughter]
[56:28] but i didn't give up
[56:31] i kept praying
[56:33] and it wasn't too long after that maybe
[56:35] a couple of weeks
[56:37] you know back in those days we had the
[56:38] old reel-to-reel tapes i had 300 of them
[56:41] in the church we got from brother perry
[56:43] green we call them seed tapes
[56:45] and then
[56:46] a
[56:47] friend of mine there in colombia
[56:50] a elderly gentleman had passed on
[56:52] uh he was really believing the message
[56:54] he had nine ninety
[56:56] of the tapes his wife wasn't a real
[56:58] believer so when he died
[57:00] she gave me all of his tapes now we've
[57:02] got 390 tapes
[57:05] of the prophet
[57:06] and this was 1975
[57:09] and so
[57:10] i
[57:11] thought well i haven't heard
[57:13] those 90 tapes yet you know let me get
[57:15] my hands on one of them
[57:17] and i was preparing a message for where
[57:19] i was doing little missionary outreach
[57:21] down in charleston area from columbia
[57:23] and so i i picked this tape
[57:26] uh entitled the secret sudden going away
[57:29] of the church i think that's the name of
[57:31] it
[57:31] and in there brother branham is talking
[57:33] about the man going out west to look for
[57:35] his wife
[57:36] you know the armor meat packing man
[57:39] and so
[57:40] uh
[57:41] i'm i got my up in the middle of the bed
[57:44] with my legs crossed and i got my real
[57:46] real tape right here in the bed with me
[57:48] you know it was a actually it was an old
[57:50] man i used to have a wallow sack and
[57:51] this is sony i nude up a little bit and
[57:54] got a nicer uh
[57:55] reel-to-reel tape
[57:57] player
[57:58] and
[57:59] i get to this place where this
[58:01] uh
[58:02] this
[58:04] young man goes out west you know and
[58:06] he's
[58:07] uh
[58:08] visiting out there looking for a wife of
[58:10] course all the
[58:12] ranchers daughters they all you know
[58:14] acted like they're going to get him and
[58:15] they put on their frock and everything
[58:18] and they're sick shooters and the dance
[58:20] and the big feast and so forth
[58:22] but that's he didn't he wasn't looking
[58:24] for that
[58:25] but there was one little girl
[58:28] amen that little cousin or something
[58:31] that was pouring out the dishwater
[58:33] you know
[58:35] and happened to work barefooted
[58:38] and he noticed her
[58:40] you know because he he went away from
[58:42] the party and set out on the crowd fence
[58:44] and then he noticed this little girl and
[58:47] one day he or one night it was i think
[58:49] he got between her and the house and
[58:51] said now
[58:52] do you know why i'm over here
[58:54] and uh she said well i
[58:58] you know and he said well i'm i'm
[59:00] looking for a wife
[59:02] and he said i believe you're you're the
[59:04] one that i'm looking for
[59:07] amen aren't you glad the lord was
[59:09] looking for you
[59:10] oh
[59:11] my
[59:12] oh my
[59:13] you have not chosen me but i've chosen
[59:16] you amen only
[59:19] only the predestinated are considered in
[59:22] redemption
[59:26] if you question that go listen to the
[59:28] tape
[59:30] who is this melchizedek
[59:33] let me say that again only the
[59:35] predestinated are considered in
[59:38] redemption
[59:39] amen unless you have a predestinated
[59:42] representation
[59:44] you haven't got an ear to hear the voice
[59:46] of god for your day
[59:48] [Music]
[59:52] and i had just heard brother branham
[59:55] he said it's one of the quotes here i
[59:57] want to if we have the time to get to it
[59:59] tonight
[1:00:00] uh brother branham i hear in one of the
[1:00:02] quotes we have tonight he said now here
[1:00:04] it is right here i'll just read this or
[1:00:07] maybe we have it on the screen do we
[1:00:08] have that on the screen it's actually
[1:00:10] number three
[1:00:12] uh two of number three
[1:00:14] if we could bring that up on the screen
[1:00:16] i want the church to see this
[1:00:18] because this was so key in my life
[1:00:20] brother stephen
[1:00:22] it was so key
[1:00:23] because i had just heard brother branham
[1:00:25] say this
[1:00:26] he said i
[1:00:28] am god's voice to you
[1:00:34] he said
[1:00:36] he said now if that offended you but he
[1:00:38] said it again i am god's when the angel
[1:00:41] of the lord moves down and so forth i am
[1:00:43] god's voice to you
[1:00:44] is that right
[1:00:46] look at this
[1:00:48] now this that's not the one right there
[1:00:50] but
[1:00:54] uh it's number three
[1:00:58] in the order
[1:01:00] i believe
[1:01:03] okay here we go here we go
[1:01:06] now i'm your brother by the grace of god
[1:01:09] but when the angel of the lord moves
[1:01:11] down it becomes then a voice of god to
[1:01:14] you
[1:01:15] maybe if i offended you by saying that
[1:01:18] forgive me
[1:01:19] but i felt that might have been resented
[1:01:23] you know that's the problem in this
[1:01:24] message
[1:01:25] people without a revelation resist
[1:01:29] the authority of the voice of god
[1:01:36] but i am god's voice to you see
[1:01:39] i say that again
[1:01:41] that time was under inspiration you see
[1:01:44] and i felt bad about it the first time
[1:01:47] but i it repeated it it repeated it now
[1:01:50] see i can say nothing in myself but what
[1:01:53] he shows me i say it
[1:01:55] you believe it and watch what happens
[1:01:58] see he did
[1:02:00] after sitting in the great meetings
[1:02:03] and so
[1:02:04] i thought well
[1:02:06] but i really wasn't thinking about that
[1:02:08] quotation i just heard brother branham
[1:02:10] say it and here i am listen to this tape
[1:02:12] and all of a sudden this little woman
[1:02:15] says
[1:02:17] i'm unworthy to be your wife
[1:02:21] and and the voice of god through the
[1:02:23] prophet said that's the one the one that
[1:02:26] says she's unworthy
[1:02:30] [Applause]
[1:02:34] i
[1:02:35] i turned i flipped the switch and i put
[1:02:37] it on rewind
[1:02:40] i played it again
[1:02:42] and
[1:02:43] what it said to me
[1:02:45] was
[1:02:46] that's the one the one that says she's
[1:02:48] unworthy
[1:02:50] i played it the third time
[1:02:53] you know what i said the third time
[1:02:56] the same thing
[1:02:58] the tapes always say the same thing
[1:03:00] [Applause]
[1:03:03] amen you can't make them say anything
[1:03:05] different
[1:03:08] but i didn't tell nobody i just slipped
[1:03:10] out of my room there went into the
[1:03:12] auditorium and knelt down and started
[1:03:14] praying i said god could you possibly be
[1:03:16] speaking to me
[1:03:18] i don't want to just
[1:03:19] you know you can make the bible say
[1:03:21] anything you want to
[1:03:23] the bible says
[1:03:24] what they'll do is do quickly
[1:03:27] and then it also said judas went out and
[1:03:29] hung himself you could put it together
[1:03:31] and
[1:03:32] say well so-and-so's got to go hang
[1:03:34] themselves
[1:03:35] but and do it right now quickly
[1:03:39] but see i said lord am i just hearing
[1:03:42] things am i just wanting to hear this
[1:03:45] you have to be careful now you better
[1:03:48] know it's the holy ghost
[1:03:49] you better know it's the leadership of
[1:03:51] the spirit of god amen
[1:03:54] amen
[1:03:55] i didn't tell nobody
[1:03:58] i just felt a witness in my heart
[1:04:00] that was god
[1:04:02] speaking the voice of god
[1:04:04] answering my vow
[1:04:06] but i didn't tell anybody
[1:04:07] i went straight to arkansas or that they
[1:04:10] was having a special meeting about 700
[1:04:12] believers were
[1:04:14] gathered during those times for meetings
[1:04:16] a camp meeting
[1:04:18] and there happened to be my little wife
[1:04:20] i knew she was going to be there
[1:04:22] and so i
[1:04:24] i
[1:04:25] checked with her
[1:04:26] a sister who was in charge kind of a
[1:04:29] older sister at that time i think
[1:04:31] and we had the privilege of having a
[1:04:33] little privacy to talk
[1:04:35] and i told her
[1:04:37] and then i told her my background and
[1:04:38] she told me her background
[1:04:41] and that night
[1:04:42] i said now if your daddy agrees
[1:04:44] [Laughter]
[1:04:46] we had to call daddy
[1:04:48] amen
[1:04:49] do you realize the bible brother brown
[1:04:51] said consider the law consult the law
[1:04:55] of marriage and divorce in those things
[1:04:57] in the scriptures amen he see it doesn't
[1:05:00] all those things are still relevant in a
[1:05:02] sense
[1:05:03] and so i called up her father that night
[1:05:06] and i said brother davis i said would
[1:05:09] you uh
[1:05:10] i got him up it was about eleven o'clock
[1:05:12] at night
[1:05:14] and his name was charles you know so i
[1:05:16] said would you mind coming out on the
[1:05:17] porch and me talking with me you know
[1:05:18] brother branham had to ask his father
[1:05:20] out on the porch he didn't catch what i
[1:05:22] was talking about
[1:05:24] because i woke him up at 11 o'clock at
[1:05:26] night i said well what i'm trying to say
[1:05:28] is i'm wondering if i could marry your
[1:05:30] daughter
[1:05:32] ah and he said well son he said i
[1:05:35] i don't know of anybody that i'd rather
[1:05:37] have as a son-in-law than you
[1:05:40] he said in fact god had already showed
[1:05:42] me that you is going to be my son-in-law
[1:05:44] yeah
[1:05:45] amen
[1:05:51] and so
[1:05:53] uh i went back to south carolina didn't
[1:05:55] tell nobody but when i got back i told
[1:05:57] my song leader and he said well you
[1:05:59] gotta announce it to the to the church

[1:06:03] morning and i was so well i really
[1:06:06] didn't want to announce it uh and kind
[1:06:08] of semi forgot about it i guess but out
[1:06:10] on the front porch then we'd all
[1:06:12] dismissed little church wouldn't hold
[1:06:14] but about 75 people maybe there on pope
[1:06:17] street in colombia

[1:06:23] the church the song leader said i
[1:06:24] believe the pastor's got an announcement
[1:06:26] to make to the church

[1:06:43] few dreams for her

[1:09:56] that word has never failed in the mouths
[1:09:59] of believing
[1:10:00] christians and in this last age it is
[1:10:04] here stronger and greater than ever in
[1:10:08] the true word bride

[1:10:24] [Applause]
[1:10:28] that word has never failed in the mouths
[1:10:31] of believing christian and in this last
[1:10:33] age this age
[1:10:35] it is here stronger and greater than
[1:10:37] ever in the true word right

[1:10:53] the new
[1:10:55] this is the opening of the word of god
[1:10:58] oh
[1:10:59] my here's stronger and greater
[1:11:03] in this age on page 64 he says it like
[1:11:06] this don't fear john
[1:11:08] don't fear little flock
[1:11:10] all that i am you are heir to
[1:11:14] oh my power is yours
[1:11:17] my omnipotence is yours
[1:11:19] and i stand in your midst
[1:11:22] i have not come to bring fear and
[1:11:24] failure but love and courage and ability
[1:11:29] all power is given unto me
[1:11:32] and it is yours to use
[1:11:35] you speak the word and i will perform it
[1:11:39] that is my covenant and it cannot never
[1:11:43] fail

[1:11:48] that's god's covenant
[1:11:51] oh my god i needed that back there
[1:11:54] because i didn't know
[1:11:56] you know you feel
[1:11:57] so unworthy
[1:11:59] and so forth
[1:12:00] but that was an encouragement to me as
[1:12:03] the lord reminded me of those scriptures
[1:12:05] so i thought i'd just share them with
[1:12:06] you if you have your bibles and would
[1:12:09] like to stand i want you to i'd like to
[1:12:11] draw your attention to hebrews chapter
[1:12:13] 3.
[1:12:15] verse 1
[1:12:17] wherefore holy brethren
[1:12:19] partakers of the heavenly calling
[1:12:21] consider the apostle
[1:12:25] and high priest of our profession christ
[1:12:29] jesus amen
[1:12:30] who was faithful to him that appointed
[1:12:33] him
[1:12:34] as also moses was faithful in all his
[1:12:37] house
[1:12:38] for this man was counted worthy of more
[1:12:41] glory than moses in as much as he who
[1:12:45] hath builded the house is has hath more
[1:12:48] honor than the house
[1:12:50] for every house is builded by some man
[1:12:54] but he that built all things amen he's
[1:12:57] god
[1:12:58] and that was emmanuel is that right
[1:13:00] which being interpreted is god with us
[1:13:03] jehovah the old testament none other
[1:13:05] than jesus christ of the new testament
[1:13:07] and moses fairly was faithful in all his
[1:13:10] house as a servant
[1:13:12] for a testimony of those things which
[1:13:15] were to be spoken after but christ as a
[1:13:19] son over his own house whose house are
[1:13:22] we
[1:13:24] if we hold fast the confidence
[1:13:28] and the rejoicing of the hope firm unto
[1:13:30] the end wherefore
[1:13:33] as the holy ghost saith today if you
[1:13:36] will hear his voice
[1:13:40] harden not your hearts as in the
[1:13:42] provocation
[1:13:43] in the days of temptation in the
[1:13:45] wilderness
[1:13:47] amen i'm going to skip on down to verse
[1:13:49] 14.
[1:13:51] for we are made partakers
[1:13:53] of christ if we hold the beginning of
[1:13:56] our confidence steadfast unto the end
[1:13:59] while it is said today
[1:14:02] if ye will hear his voice harden not
[1:14:05] your hearts as in the provocation
[1:14:08] i believe that's sufficient reading
[1:14:09] let's pray now
[1:14:11] with our heads bowed
[1:14:13] lord jesus we need you this hour to
[1:14:16] speak to every heart
[1:14:18] and especially to mind or consecrate us
[1:14:20] for this little service tonight

[1:14:25] bless it lord continue to bless uh
[1:14:28] brother shembo lord god just continue

[1:14:33] the windows of heaven and continue to

[1:14:38] service
[1:14:39] granted is our prayer in jesus name amen
[1:14:42] you may be seated the lord bless you
[1:14:45] i want to speak tonight on the voice
[1:14:50] of god for our day but a sub-topic
[1:14:54] the
[1:14:54] order
[1:14:56] the apostolic order of the scripture
[1:14:59] and
[1:15:01] i want to ask the church a question here
[1:15:03] and i don't want you to answer it
[1:15:05] verbally but in your heart just tell me
[1:15:07] just tell yourself whether or not you
[1:15:10] have the answer
[1:15:11] if you'd like to lift your hand and you
[1:15:13] have the answer that's okay too who was
[1:15:15] the first apostle in the new testament
[1:15:20] anybody know
[1:15:22] all right good all right we just read it
[1:15:25] here in the scripture
[1:15:27] this is evidence that jesus christ was
[1:15:30] the first apostle in the new testament
[1:15:33] because this is the only place in the
[1:15:34] bible where jesus is called an apostle
[1:15:38] you say well what about john the baptist
[1:15:40] he was one sent from god and the
[1:15:41] missionary apostle is one sin john the
[1:15:44] baptist himself said christ was
[1:15:47] preferred before me because he was
[1:15:49] performing
[1:15:51] before abraham was i am
[1:15:54] twice john the baptist said he was
[1:15:56] preferred before me because he is before
[1:15:58] me he was before me
[1:16:00] so we see then that jesus christ
[1:16:03] is the first apostle in the new
[1:16:05] testament
[1:16:07] and
[1:16:07] if they have the order of those quotes
[1:16:10] now
[1:16:10] i want to
[1:16:12] be real quick with these quotes brethren
[1:16:14] and
[1:16:15] just have them ready to flip on the
[1:16:17] screen
[1:16:18] because we want the message to speak to
[1:16:20] us tonight just
[1:16:22] not a
[1:16:25] uneducated south carolinian
[1:16:30] now
[1:16:32] maybe we'll read one other scripture
[1:16:33] while they're getting ready to pull
[1:16:34] those quotes up and we'll do them in the
[1:16:36] order that we that i gave them to you uh
[1:16:40] if you will
[1:16:42] let's go over here now right quick
[1:16:44] to first corinthians
[1:16:47] three
[1:16:50] and this is just kind of a
[1:16:52] a little teaching
[1:16:54] little teaching
[1:16:56] uh
[1:16:57] message i guess you'd call it that
[1:16:59] first corinthians 3 1 uh 3 9 i'm sorry
[1:17:03] verse 9.
[1:17:05] for we are laborers together
[1:17:07] with god
[1:17:09] ye are god's husbandry you are god's
[1:17:11] building
[1:17:13] whose building you are so we just
[1:17:17] according to the grace of god which is
[1:17:19] given unto me as a wise master builder
[1:17:21] i've laid the foundation and another
[1:17:23] buildeth their own
[1:17:25] but let every man take heed how he
[1:17:28] buildeth their own for other foundation
[1:17:31] can no man lay than that which is laid
[1:17:33] which is jesus christ
[1:17:36] so
[1:17:38] we're
[1:17:39] talking about the apostolic order
[1:17:42] and um we want to go forward here
[1:17:48] and um
[1:17:50] maybe
[1:17:51] read one other scripture before we go to
[1:17:53] the quotes and we'll try to be real
[1:17:54] quick
[1:17:56] uh revelation chapter 3
[1:17:58] and if you'll notice here
[1:18:01] verse 20
[1:18:02] behold i stand at the door and knock if
[1:18:04] any man hear my voice and open the door
[1:18:07] i will come in to him and will sup with
[1:18:11] him and he with me
[1:18:14] none of the previous six uh ages
[1:18:18] spoke of the voice of god
[1:18:20] only in this seventh
[1:18:23] age
[1:18:25] of laodicea
[1:18:28] is the voice of god mentioned
[1:18:31] if any man hear my voice
[1:18:35] okay
[1:18:36] now then i want to draw your attention
[1:18:38] while we're here in revelations to
[1:18:40] chapter 6 and verse 7.
[1:18:45] and before we read verse 7 i'd like to
[1:18:48] draw your attention to the first
[1:18:50] three beasts
[1:18:52] the first three seals
[1:18:55] and in each case verse 1
[1:18:59] i saw when the lamb
[1:19:01] had opened
[1:19:03] one of the seals and i heard as it were
[1:19:05] the noise of thunder
[1:19:07] one of the four beasts say saying come
[1:19:10] and see
[1:19:11] all right verse three and when it opened
[1:19:14] the second seal i heard the second beast
[1:19:16] say come see
[1:19:19] and the third
[1:19:21] seal in verse five and when he had
[1:19:23] opened the third seal i heard the third
[1:19:25] beast say come see
[1:19:28] but notice the difference now when it
[1:19:30] comes to this fourth
[1:19:31] seal
[1:19:33] which is the eagle
[1:19:35] age
[1:19:36] and
[1:19:38] we'll read beginning with
[1:19:44] verse 7
[1:19:47] okay
[1:19:48] and when he had opened the fourth seal
[1:19:51] i heard the voice of the fourth beast
[1:19:55] say come and see
[1:19:58] and we know that
[1:20:00] this is the eagle age amen
[1:20:03] and i was so uh
[1:20:05] encouraged to see the big eagle out
[1:20:07] front
[1:20:08] and then when i it's my first time to be
[1:20:11] here and then the spoken word
[1:20:15] amen the spoken word is the voice of god
[1:20:17] for our day and that's the original seed
[1:20:20] the spoken word is the original seed is
[1:20:22] that right
[1:20:23] amen
[1:20:24] all right one other scripture if it's
[1:20:26] not scriptural it's it's we don't want
[1:20:29] it is that right
[1:20:30] one other scripture and that's in isaiah
[1:20:33] chapter
[1:20:34] 62 52
[1:20:36] isaiah 52
[1:20:39] and uh this is very important
[1:20:42] and here we're going to read the three
[1:20:44] verses at least beginning with verse six
[1:20:47] isaiah
[1:20:48] 52 6 listen real closely
[1:20:51] because remember now
[1:20:54] uh in the message
[1:20:56] uh christ the mystery of god revealed
[1:20:58] the prophet taught us that if you can
[1:21:00] read one verse of scripture and you
[1:21:02] don't see jesus christ
[1:21:04] in your bible in that verse of scripture
[1:21:06] you need to read it again
[1:21:08] because jesus christ is the principle
[1:21:10] theme of the entire scriptures is that
[1:21:12] right
[1:21:13] okay so
[1:21:14] all right then let's see if we can see
[1:21:16] the message and we can see christ in
[1:21:18] these verses
[1:21:20] isaiah 52 6
[1:21:23] therefore my people shall know my name
[1:21:28] not titles
[1:21:30] therefore they shall know in that day
[1:21:33] that i am
[1:21:35] he that speak
[1:21:38] that doth speak
[1:21:39] behold it is i
[1:21:42] how beautiful upon the mountains are the
[1:21:46] feet of him that bringeth good tidings
[1:21:48] and publish of peace and bringeth good
[1:21:50] tidings of good and publishes salvation
[1:21:53] that saith unto zion
[1:21:56] thy god reigneth
[1:21:59] now here it is
[1:22:01] thy watchman
[1:22:03] he's not talking about false shepherds
[1:22:04] here he's talking about thy watchman
[1:22:06] god's watchman thy watchman shall lift
[1:22:09] up the voice
[1:22:11] with the voice together shall they sing
[1:22:15] for they shall see eye to eye when the
[1:22:17] lord shall bring again zion
[1:22:21] the restoration of zion see
[1:22:25] brother adam said any time you see the
[1:22:27] the words daughter of zion it's speaking
[1:22:29] of the bride
[1:22:30] and the way god restores zion is the way
[1:22:33] he restores the bride tree
[1:22:35] amen
[1:22:36] and so we
[1:22:38] are living now
[1:22:40] in the fulfillment of malachi 4.
[1:22:44] behold i send unto you elijah the
[1:22:46] prophet
[1:22:47] and he
[1:22:48] not some denomination not some group of
[1:22:50] preachers but he shall
[1:22:54] turn the heart of the children back to
[1:22:55] the fathers is that right
[1:22:57] and restore the word of god
[1:23:00] and so here he says it now
[1:23:02] when the lord shall bring against zion
[1:23:05] there's a time when this voice of god is
[1:23:08] going to be elevated
[1:23:10] it's going to be lifted up
[1:23:12] and we have to not only talk about the
[1:23:15] message
[1:23:16] anybody can just
[1:23:17] read that's just being able to read you
[1:23:20] know or hear
[1:23:21] that just using your ear the natural
[1:23:24] but see
[1:23:26] if we had a song book we could read to
[1:23:29] you i could read to you out of the song
[1:23:30] book
[1:23:32] but for me to sing that song
[1:23:34] that's that's something different
[1:23:37] put the words with music and the lyrics
[1:23:39] the music and the harmony and then for
[1:23:41] all of us to get in one mind and one
[1:23:43] accord
[1:23:44] and lift up the voice together that's
[1:23:46] when the holy spirit is really going to
[1:23:48] move in our midst because the holy
[1:23:51] spirit loves harmony and unity
[1:23:54] amen and we can only do that as we see
[1:23:57] with one eye
[1:23:59] as the seer of god has brought the word
[1:24:01] of god to us
[1:24:03] and the spirit and the prophet and the
[1:24:05] bride all say the same thing
[1:24:07] amen
[1:24:10] under her messenger she will be the
[1:24:13] final voice to the final age
[1:24:16] under her messenger
[1:24:20] and then when the rapture takes place
[1:24:22] the spirit of the the voice of the
[1:24:25] bridegroom and the voice of the bride
[1:24:27] will be heard in her no longer
[1:24:30] see the voice of the bridegroom and of
[1:24:32] the bride is one voice
[1:24:35] god doesn't have two different voices
[1:24:38] and all that was poured into
[1:24:41] all that god was was poured into christ
[1:24:43] and all that was in christ is poured
[1:24:45] into his elect
[1:24:47] into the true church of the living god
[1:24:51] oh my what are we living in no wonder
[1:24:54] he's here stronger and greater in this
[1:24:56] age than in any other previous time
[1:25:02] all right i want to go forward
[1:25:04] now so
[1:25:05] let's go fast as we possibly can
[1:25:08] i realize that this is wednesday night
[1:25:12] and uh how many how many gifts how many
[1:25:15] privileged to have a job and you get to
[1:25:17] work tomorrow
[1:25:19] you get to go to work
[1:25:21] you should never say i have to go to
[1:25:23] work
[1:25:24] you should never say i i have to go to
[1:25:26] church
[1:25:27] you should say oh it's a privilege to go
[1:25:29] to church
[1:25:30] i was happy when they said unto me let
[1:25:33] us go into the house of the lord
[1:25:36] amen enter his cage with thanksgiving
[1:25:38] into his course with praise right yes
[1:25:41] amen all right
[1:25:44] now
[1:25:45] the order that we have these i want you
[1:25:46] to do them one right after another
[1:25:49] and i wish i had a pointer but it's all
[1:25:51] right
[1:25:52] bible teaching is usually a little
[1:25:54] treacherous
[1:26:00] a little you know kind of uh walking out
[1:26:03] on the thin ice we call it
[1:26:06] but you just feel
[1:26:08] we just feel
[1:26:10] that maybe at this point and at this
[1:26:13] time it might be good to kind of bring
[1:26:15] the church to what i think a complete
[1:26:18] understanding positionally
[1:26:20] of what we are in christ jesus
[1:26:24] and sometimes i think that preaching is
[1:26:27] a wonderful thing
[1:26:28] but i believe sometimes brother dealer
[1:26:31] that teaching goes beyond that
[1:26:34] it kindly especially to the church
[1:26:37] now preaching usually catches the sinner
[1:26:40] brings him under condemnation by the
[1:26:42] word but teaching places the man
[1:26:45] positionally what he is
[1:26:47] and we can never rightly be able to have
[1:26:50] faith until positionally we know what we
[1:26:54] are
[1:26:57] that's adoption
[1:26:59] what's adoption brother hughes your
[1:27:01] position in christ
[1:27:03] amen
[1:27:05] all right
[1:27:07] he was taught by the holy ghost one day
[1:27:10] jesus was up on the earth a certain
[1:27:12] important man came to him we know it was
[1:27:14] nicodemus this man said rabbi we know
[1:27:17] you are a teacher sin from god
[1:27:19] but
[1:27:20] you will notice that jesus cut him short
[1:27:24] he turned to nicodemus and the words
[1:27:27] that he spoke may well be paraphrased
[1:27:30] thusly i am not a teacher
[1:27:35] when i first read that in the church age
[1:27:37] book i thought what is this
[1:27:40] i am the sacrificial lamb for sin
[1:27:44] i am making possible the new birth
[1:27:47] my spirit
[1:27:48] by my spirit
[1:27:50] but there is coming one who is the
[1:27:52] teacher he is the holy spirit
[1:27:56] when jesus was up on the earth he came
[1:27:58] as the lamb and as the prophet but when
[1:28:01] he came back upon the church he the same
[1:28:04] one came back upon the church
[1:28:07] by his spirit he became the teacher
[1:28:10] and to every age we hear the same truth
[1:28:13] he that hath an ear let him hear what
[1:28:15] the spirit saith to the churches
[1:28:19] in all seven church ages
[1:28:22] the same
[1:28:24] words are
[1:28:27] he repeated hath an ear let him hear
[1:28:29] what the spirit saith to the churches
[1:28:32] now we're talking about the evidence of
[1:28:34] the holy ghost
[1:28:34] [Laughter]
[1:28:37] they either have an ear let him here
[1:28:40] oh my here it is now
[1:28:43] david no better than that nathan was in
[1:28:46] the land
[1:28:48] in that day he wasn't even consulted at
[1:28:50] all
[1:28:53] see
[1:28:54] he consulted the captains of hundreds
[1:28:56] and thousands and the people shouted and
[1:28:58] screamed and danced
[1:29:00] instead they had all religious motion
[1:29:03] but it wasn't in the line and order of
[1:29:06] god's word and it failed
[1:29:09] listen close now
[1:29:11] anything else is not in the line and
[1:29:13] order of god's word will fail
[1:29:17] only god's word will stand forever
[1:29:19] heavens and earth will pass away but not
[1:29:22] my word
[1:29:24] so tonight we're talking about the
[1:29:27] apostolic order
[1:29:31] anything that's outside of the line and
[1:29:34] order of god's word will fail
[1:29:36] remember the scripture also says let all
[1:29:38] things be done decently and in order
[1:29:41] so god's got an order
[1:29:44] listen closely
[1:29:46] now i'm just
[1:29:47] your brother we had that one already
[1:29:49] let's let's go forward
[1:29:53] now faith
[1:29:54] is based on forgiveness
[1:29:58] perfect faith
[1:30:01] and then if we now brother branham had
[1:30:03] just read the text in mark 6 uh mark 11
[1:30:07] 22
[1:30:08] if you say unto this mountain okay
[1:30:10] that's where he took his text when he
[1:30:11] preached this message and then the first
[1:30:13] thing he says after he takes his text
[1:30:16] now faith is based on forgiveness then
[1:30:19] and then as we said this morning trying
[1:30:22] to get the church into the place to
[1:30:24] where we could really see apostolic
[1:30:27] times
[1:30:29] moving among us
[1:30:31] that's what we all hunger
[1:30:35] and that's just laying right at the door
[1:30:37] we see it
[1:30:38] but we want to see more of it
[1:30:41] we wanted such a flow that it'll it'll
[1:30:44] be a help to us
[1:30:47] us flow out to others
[1:30:52] my
[1:30:53] apostolic order flowing out to others
[1:30:56] we need a revelation of the apostolic
[1:30:59] order of almighty god and then we can
[1:31:02] come to order ourselves and then we can
[1:31:05] let that same order flow out to others
[1:31:08] and teach the proper order of church
[1:31:10] order and the scriptural order
[1:31:12] of the living god
[1:31:16] and the brewery lesson we had last night
[1:31:19] now this is backing up to 1954 mark of
[1:31:22] the beast
[1:31:23] listen closely
[1:31:25] actually i didn't even recognize this
[1:31:27] quote until about two years ago three
[1:31:29] years ago
[1:31:30] of all my study and all the years of
[1:31:32] studying the myths i probably heard it
[1:31:33] but it didn't register you know what i
[1:31:35] mean
[1:31:36] okay
[1:31:37] and the very lesson we had last night
[1:31:40] he had seven stars in his hand
[1:31:43] and each star was to be given
[1:31:47] to each church age for a light
[1:31:51] right
[1:31:52] just the same as there's an apostle
[1:31:54] there there's an apostle there there's
[1:31:56] an apostle there there's an apostle
[1:31:58] there which was the seven spirits in the
[1:32:03] beginning of our lesson standing before
[1:32:06] god to be sent out to the seven church
[1:32:09] ages
[1:32:12] [Applause]
[1:32:16] now
[1:32:18] brother branham said brother branham
[1:32:20] said i don't know why they want to be
[1:32:21] called missionaries
[1:32:23] but really it's an
[1:32:24] apostle so
[1:32:26] then
[1:32:28] he's
[1:32:29] if you want to be technical brother
[1:32:30] branham calls himself an apostle over 40
[1:32:33] times in the message
[1:32:36] over 40 times brother branham said i'm a
[1:32:38] missionary
[1:32:40] but he didn't go around patting himself
[1:32:42] on the back
[1:32:43] boast himself and say you got to follow
[1:32:45] me
[1:32:47] i want to compare
[1:32:48] the apostolic ministry that god has sent
[1:32:52] to us in this day i'd like for us to
[1:32:54] consider it a little bit and compare it
[1:32:57] with the so-called apostle
[1:32:59] ministry that we find in
[1:33:01] africa
[1:33:03] south america
[1:33:04] north america
[1:33:06] and europe
[1:33:07] many different parts even in india i run
[1:33:09] into it over there
[1:33:11] some
[1:33:12] man that raise up and even claiming to
[1:33:14] believe the message but you've got to
[1:33:16] come under my authority
[1:33:19] you got to be one and and you got the
[1:33:21] different little churches even have to
[1:33:22] pay tithe in many cases to the head
[1:33:24] church
[1:33:26] brother bran i never did do anything
[1:33:27] like that
[1:33:30] and you don't see paul doing that either
[1:33:33] but look
[1:33:36] only one message for each age receives
[1:33:38] what the spirit has to say for that age
[1:33:41] and that one messenger is the messenger
[1:33:43] to the true church
[1:33:45] he speaks for god by revelation to the
[1:33:48] churches plural both true and false
[1:33:52] the message is then broadcast to all
[1:33:55] but though it is broadcast for all who
[1:33:57] come within the range of the message
[1:34:00] that message is received individually
[1:34:04] individually
[1:34:05] by only a certain qualified group in a
[1:34:09] certain way
[1:34:11] [Applause]
[1:34:12] each individual in that group is the one
[1:34:15] who has the ability to hear what the
[1:34:17] spirit is saying
[1:34:18] by way of the messenger
[1:34:22] those who here are not getting their own
[1:34:24] private revelation
[1:34:26] nor is a group getting their collective
[1:34:28] revelation but each person and brother
[1:34:31] branham has it in big bowl letters
[1:34:33] each person
[1:34:35] is hearing and receiving what the
[1:34:38] messenger has already received from god
[1:34:40] amen
[1:34:44] that's when we can see eye to eye
[1:34:46] that's when we can lift up the voice
[1:34:49] and and sing together
[1:34:52] they may not just talk the message but
[1:34:54] walk the message and sing the message
[1:34:58] oh it's music in god's ears then
[1:35:01] hallelujah
[1:35:02] oh my then we can see
[1:35:06] how that angels could not perfect
[1:35:08] worship
[1:35:09] they cannot sing amazing grace they've
[1:35:11] never been lost only the elect can sing
[1:35:15] oh
[1:35:16] my
[1:35:17] the amazing grace of god
[1:35:18] [Music]
[1:35:21] if that was taught by the lord then
[1:35:24] confirmed by his disciples
[1:35:26] that we've heard now paul being the same
[1:35:30] uh paul was that first church angel
[1:35:32] messenger right first apostle let's
[1:35:34] let's pause here hold that on the screen
[1:35:36] just a moment
[1:35:37] now
[1:35:38] where did the 12 apostles get their
[1:35:41] apostolic
[1:35:42] anointing from jesus christ the first
[1:35:45] the first apostle
[1:35:47] we determined that jesus christ was the
[1:35:49] first apostle
[1:35:51] all right who's the last apostle
[1:35:54] of course but he himself said i'm the
[1:35:56] first and the last
[1:35:58] right
[1:35:59] okay
[1:36:00] okay but now i'm going to say something
[1:36:02] here in just a minute
[1:36:05] all seven of these manifest it takes the
[1:36:08] seven varieties of the spirit not seven
[1:36:11] gods
[1:36:12] but the seven varieties of the seven
[1:36:14] spirits
[1:36:15] to bring forth the fullness of the true
[1:36:18] apostolic ministry
[1:36:21] we have received the greatest apostolic
[1:36:24] ministry of all time
[1:36:31] what is it brother hughes it's the alpha
[1:36:33] and the omega
[1:36:35] the alpha apostol apostolic ministry the
[1:36:40] alpha son of man ministry
[1:36:42] and the omega son of man ministry
[1:36:45] [Applause]
[1:36:46] apostolic
[1:36:48] hallelujah certainly apostolic
[1:36:50] [Applause]
[1:36:54] now paul was saying record 105
[1:36:57] paul was saying that to his hebrew
[1:37:00] audience
[1:37:01] now they didn't have tape recorders
[1:37:04] today
[1:37:05] like we got here
[1:37:08] they had scribes who was sitting there
[1:37:11] taking it down just as paul was
[1:37:13] preaching it
[1:37:16] and that's what it is right here
[1:37:19] we're getting it by tape recorders
[1:37:21] and these tapes go all over the world
[1:37:25] see to show that it is the truth
[1:37:28] our religion is not in vain it's
[1:37:31] absolutely the resurrected jesus christ
[1:37:34] the same thing
[1:37:38] now we mustn't neglect it
[1:37:41] how shall we escape if we neglect who
[1:37:45] have heard the very voice of god for our
[1:37:47] day how shall we escape if we have heard
[1:37:51] the message of grace
[1:37:54] it's not law
[1:37:56] the letter killeth god
[1:37:58] it's grace
[1:38:00] oh my it's amazing grace
[1:38:02] oh
[1:38:03] yes
[1:38:06] and then i thought that sounded pretty
[1:38:08] good so i just held to that
[1:38:10] if a man's got love
[1:38:13] does sound good don't it
[1:38:17] ain't that all you need just love love
[1:38:19] everybody just go anywhere
[1:38:21] love the homos love everything just love
[1:38:24] love the government love everything
[1:38:26] let me pause here just a moment did you
[1:38:28] realize god don't love everybody
[1:38:32] you say now wait a minute brother hughes
[1:38:34] where's that in the bible
[1:38:36] jacob have i loved
[1:38:41] but esau
[1:38:43] i have hated
[1:38:45] god hates sin
[1:38:49] god hates compromisers god hates
[1:38:51] hypocrites
[1:38:54] god loves his elect god loves him
[1:38:56] predestinated
[1:38:58] god foreknew
[1:39:00] that you would love him and would want
[1:39:02] to serve him
[1:39:04] hallelujah now maybe i better say
[1:39:07] something here also before we go for
[1:39:09] further
[1:39:10] god does not predestinate just on the
[1:39:12] basis of his desire because he his
[1:39:15] desire is not that any should perish
[1:39:18] but that all should come to repentance
[1:39:20] he's long suffering
[1:39:22] but
[1:39:23] he predestinates on the basis of his
[1:39:25] foreknowledge
[1:39:26] is that right
[1:39:28] amen oh my god
[1:39:31] yes indeed
[1:39:33] all right here we are now let's go
[1:39:35] forward
[1:39:36] and then i thought well that sounds
[1:39:38] pretty good so i just held to that you
[1:39:40] know the background of this if you want
[1:39:42] to go listen to it he's been talking to
[1:39:44] brother vale about what is the evidence
[1:39:46] of the holy ghost okay and uh he asked
[1:39:49] brother vale uh you know what do you
[1:39:52] think and brother bill asked him well he
[1:39:54] said do you think it's in uh speaking in
[1:39:57] tongues he said no even though i've been
[1:39:59] taught that i don't think so what do you
[1:40:01] think it is then brother branham he said
[1:40:03] well you know
[1:40:04] best i know is is love
[1:40:06] and he said so i held to that we held to
[1:40:08] that for a while
[1:40:10] but i want you to notice that god
[1:40:12] straightens his man out
[1:40:14] look what's this
[1:40:17] but one day the lord in a vision
[1:40:19] straightened me out
[1:40:21] [Music]
[1:40:23] pause again
[1:40:25] i gotta pause again
[1:40:28] we are not feeding on the words of a man
[1:40:32] his words will fail
[1:40:35] but we are feeding on the unfailing body
[1:40:37] word of the son of man
[1:40:40] jesus christ
[1:40:41] the same yesterday today and forever
[1:40:45] oh we must not neglect this message
[1:40:49] we must have an ear to hear and feed
[1:40:52] oh my respect the voice of god for your
[1:40:55] day
[1:40:58] god straightened me out in a vision he
[1:40:59] said the evidence of the spirit was
[1:41:02] those who could receive the word
[1:41:05] neither love nor speaking in tongues but
[1:41:08] it's receiving the word
[1:41:10] [Applause]
[1:41:12] [Music]
[1:41:15] and then dr vale was saying to me he
[1:41:18] said that's that's scriptural he said
[1:41:20] because in john jesus said when the holy
[1:41:23] ghost is come upon you he will reveal
[1:41:26] these things to you that i've taught you
[1:41:29] and will show you things to come so
[1:41:32] there is a genuine evidence of the holy
[1:41:35] ghost he has never told me anything
[1:41:37] wrong yet
[1:41:40] it is the evidence of the holy ghost
[1:41:43] is he who can believe the word you can
[1:41:46] receive it
[1:41:48] jesus never said when the holy ghost
[1:41:50] comes you'll speak in tongues he never
[1:41:52] said when the holy ghost come you do any
[1:41:55] of these things manifestations
[1:41:58] i'll put that in there but he said he
[1:42:01] will take these things of mine and show
[1:42:04] them to you and will show you things
[1:42:06] that is to come
[1:42:08] so there is the genuine evidence of the
[1:42:10] holy ghost according to jesus himself
[1:42:15] [Music]
[1:42:17] he that hath an ear let him hear
[1:42:20] amen
[1:42:24] when this chain is broke this is harvest
[1:42:26] time 64.
[1:42:29] listen now we're going to say something
[1:42:32] when this chain is broke
[1:42:35] i've got a chain in my pulpit
[1:42:37] at the church
[1:42:39] about two foot long
[1:42:41] and sometimes i'll get somebody hanging
[1:42:43] on that chain over the over the
[1:42:46] altar
[1:42:47] and i'll hold on to that chain
[1:42:50] and that's how we are hanging over hell
[1:42:54] by a chain
[1:42:56] and it's only as strong as its weakest
[1:42:58] link
[1:43:00] don't forget that
[1:43:02] when this chain is broke adam and eve
[1:43:04] the first family now remember they
[1:43:06] didn't break a sentence they didn't
[1:43:08] break three words one word
[1:43:11] man shall hang over hell by every word
[1:43:14] every word that proceedeth out of the
[1:43:15] mouth of god that's where man's eternal
[1:43:19] destination is determined
[1:43:23] there's where man's eternal destination
[1:43:26] is determined
[1:43:28] why he'll hang by that chain
[1:43:31] or he'll hang by creed
[1:43:33] and if there's a creed mixed into the
[1:43:35] chain there's where the weak link is
[1:43:39] and you're gone
[1:43:41] that's where the weak link was with adam
[1:43:44] and with eve
[1:43:45] that weak link
[1:43:47] surely he said you know the serpent
[1:43:50] god surely god said it
[1:43:53] if god said it god meant it
[1:43:55] and he also keeps his word by saying the
[1:43:58] day that you eat thereof that day you
[1:44:00] die
[1:44:01] everybody awake
[1:44:04] listen closely the day you put into you
[1:44:09] anything else besides the unadulterated
[1:44:12] word of god into your soul that's the
[1:44:15] day you set you're separated from god
[1:44:21] what have you been feeding on
[1:44:23] [Applause]
[1:44:27] the day you put it to you
[1:44:30] into your soul anything else
[1:44:33] besides this spoken word which is
[1:44:35] original seed
[1:44:37] the unadulterated word of god
[1:44:39] that's the day you separate yourself
[1:44:41] from god
[1:44:42] by feeding on the wrong thing
[1:44:45] we must come back to the word
[1:44:48] the truth the whole truth and know him
[1:44:50] but the truth
[1:44:51] amen the word of god for our day
[1:44:54] sure amen
[1:44:57] now we can see that jesus christ is
[1:44:59] revealing himself through the ages by
[1:45:01] his spirit in the messengers
[1:45:04] they are as moses was to the children of
[1:45:06] israel
[1:45:08] the messengers each one of these seven
[1:45:10] apostles
[1:45:11] were
[1:45:12] as moses was to the children of israel
[1:45:15] amen now remember
[1:45:17] moses
[1:45:18] wrote the basis of the old testament
[1:45:21] first five books
[1:45:22] paul wrote the majority of the epistles
[1:45:25] of the new testament
[1:45:26] amen
[1:45:28] and they both had to go to the backside
[1:45:29] of the desert amen to do that and then
[1:45:32] god sent our prophet to the backside of
[1:45:34] the desert to bring the interpretation
[1:45:37] of both the old and the new and that's
[1:45:40] what we have
[1:45:41] oh my god
[1:45:43] amen
[1:45:44] and when that happened the bible become
[1:45:46] like a new book
[1:45:49] yes amen
[1:45:52] [Music]
[1:45:54] as he had the revelation for his day so
[1:45:57] each messenger had god's revelation and
[1:46:00] ministry for that day
[1:46:02] thus when we see the messengers are in
[1:46:05] his hand we see the lord identifying
[1:46:08] himself with these men and granting them
[1:46:11] his power
[1:46:13] listen now it's not enough
[1:46:16] there's something that's not quite
[1:46:17] enough
[1:46:18] it is not enough
[1:46:21] that he has associated himself with the
[1:46:22] whole church
[1:46:24] which we saw when we seen
[1:46:26] uh when he was seen standing amongst the
[1:46:29] seven golden lampstands
[1:46:31] nor is it even enough it's not enough
[1:46:35] that's still not enough
[1:46:36] nor is it even enough that we see the
[1:46:39] fivefold ministry of ephesians four
[1:46:42] apostles prophets teachers evangelists
[1:46:46] and pastors
[1:46:48] now notice the apostles are included in
[1:46:51] here
[1:46:52] all the prophets and all the apostles
[1:46:54] are included in here
[1:46:56] but he still said that's not enough
[1:47:00] [Laughter]
[1:47:03] for in each age
[1:47:06] even in the bride age
[1:47:09] anointed ones at the end time
[1:47:13] come on now
[1:47:14] think about it in each age
[1:47:19] in each age for in each age the church
[1:47:22] goes astray
[1:47:25] and it is not just the laity but the
[1:47:28] clergy group shepherds are wrong as well
[1:47:30] as sheep
[1:47:32] then what happens capital g.o.d
[1:47:36] god brings himself on the scene as the
[1:47:39] chief shepherd
[1:47:40] in the ministry of these seven men
[1:47:43] to lead his people back to the truth and
[1:47:46] the abundant power of that truth
[1:47:49] oh hallelujah
[1:47:50] oh
[1:47:51] yes
[1:47:54] mama
[1:47:55] he that hath and ear let him hear what
[1:47:56] the spirit saith unto the churches in
[1:47:59] each age
[1:48:00] in every age it was the same crowd
[1:48:04] hear what the spirit says
[1:48:06] if you are a christian how many
[1:48:08] christians we have here tonight
[1:48:11] you will get back to what the spirit is
[1:48:14] teaching
[1:48:16] that is the word of this age
[1:48:19] every messenger of every age will preach
[1:48:23] that word
[1:48:25] how many would like to have a new and a
[1:48:27] fresh revival
[1:48:30] in your heart
[1:48:31] in your home
[1:48:32] in your church
[1:48:34] i sure would
[1:48:36] okay here's it

[1:48:46] oh
[1:48:47] my here it is here it is
[1:48:54] every fresh every one of them every
[1:48:57] fresh and every true revival
[1:48:59] will be because men have gotten back to
[1:49:02] the word for their age
[1:49:06] [Music]
[1:49:08] the cry of every age is the rebuke you
[1:49:12] have left the word of god
[1:49:14] repent
[1:49:15] and come back to the word
[1:49:18] from the first book in genesis to the
[1:49:20] last book revelation there's only one
[1:49:23] reason for god's displeasure
[1:49:27] leaving the word
[1:49:30] and there's only one remedy
[1:49:33] to regain his favor
[1:49:35] back to the word
[1:49:38] back to the word
[1:49:40] back to the message for your day
[1:49:44] hallelujah

[1:54:31] the scribe of the old testament
[1:54:34] uh that wrote he didn't write the book
[1:54:37] of revelation but he received it as
[1:54:38] described and when he got so old that he
[1:54:41] couldn't preach anymore hardly
[1:54:44] the deacons would lead him to the pulpit
[1:54:46] and he'd just beat on the pulpit
[1:54:48] and he'd say love one another that was
[1:54:51] his last words his last message love one
[1:54:54] another love one another
[1:54:56] amen
[1:54:58] amen he that loveth amen is born of god
[1:55:03] amen and so love your brother love your
[1:55:05] sister love one another and above all
[1:55:07] love god and remember
[1:55:10] this message to the laodicean age
[1:55:13] he said as many as i love i love
[1:55:16] i will rebuke and chase it be zealous
[1:55:20] therefore and repent
[1:55:22] let's bow our heads just a moment
[1:55:25] and this will be
[1:55:27] the evidence the scriptural evidence
[1:55:30] to show that you'll know whether or not
[1:55:33] you are among
[1:55:35] the elect of god
[1:55:41] you be honest with god now i've had him
[1:55:43] pull the rug out from under me i tell
[1:55:44] you he knows how to give you a weapon
[1:55:47] but he said as many as i love
[1:55:50] in the church age book brother brown
[1:55:51] said it's not our love that's in
[1:55:53] question
[1:55:54] it's god's love
[1:55:56] that's in question
[1:55:58] anybody can say i love jesus
[1:56:01] but this
[1:56:03] has the elective love of god
[1:56:06] been revealed to you
[1:56:07] through calvary
[1:56:09] for god so loved the world he gave his
[1:56:11] only begotten son how do we know that
[1:56:14] god loves us brother branham because god
[1:56:16] said so
[1:56:18] we take him at his word
[1:56:20] amen
[1:56:22] and we want to conduct ourselves in a
[1:56:24] godly manner
[1:56:25] to show
[1:56:26] amen our love back to him amen
[1:56:30] elective love
[1:56:32] with our heads bowed every eye closed if
[1:56:34] you will just for a moment
[1:56:37] thank you for your respect you've been
[1:56:39] so
[1:56:40] so
[1:56:41] jubilant tonight and victorious and
[1:56:43] pulling uh you certainly pulled your end
[1:56:45] of the saw as it were
[1:56:47] and uh it made it real easy for me to
[1:56:50] bring this message
[1:56:52] even if it was in a condensed form
[1:56:55] but
[1:56:56] i wonder now you'll be honest with god
[1:56:58] i'm not going to call you up here to the
[1:56:59] altar or anything like that but i want
[1:57:02] you to be honest with yourself see
[1:57:05] one place
[1:57:07] in the message brother ben said he's
[1:57:09] coming back
[1:57:10] for the honest in heart
[1:57:13] that's one he's coming back for the
[1:57:15] honest in heart
[1:57:17] and when the
[1:57:18] the bride raptures she won't be raptured
[1:57:20] by her good track record
[1:57:21] it'll be by the grace of god
[1:57:24] by grace through faith
[1:57:27] and so
[1:57:28] but now if you find
[1:57:30] in your own individual life that you've
[1:57:31] been maybe feeding on the wrong thing
[1:57:33] too much
[1:57:34] actually
[1:57:36] a little is too much
[1:57:39] we don't want to put anything into our
[1:57:41] soul except the unadulterated word of
[1:57:43] god
[1:57:44] remember your heart and your mind is
[1:57:46] like the womb
[1:57:48] and it
[1:57:49] it must be filled and pregnanted with
[1:57:52] this spoken word which is the original
[1:57:54] seed and when that is sealed in you by
[1:57:57] the holy ghost that token comes in
[1:57:59] nothing else can come in then see it
[1:58:01] seals the womb
[1:58:03] that life-giving flow seals the womb
[1:58:07] and
[1:58:08] you're sealed through time and eternity
[1:58:11] but maybe you'd say brother hughes i'm
[1:58:15] maybe i seem like my life i've just
[1:58:17] maybe left the word a little bit i
[1:58:19] haven't been you know paul said
[1:58:22] how shall we escape if we neglect
[1:58:25] so great a salvation
[1:58:27] and maybe you just say well brother
[1:58:28] hughes i feel like maybe the holy
[1:58:30] spirit's
[1:58:31] bringing to my attention that i've been
[1:58:33] neglecting the message i've been
[1:58:34] neglecting to read my bible a christian
[1:58:37] must read the bible and pray every day
[1:58:40] every day
[1:58:42] one place brother brown said water read
[1:58:44] chapter after chapter
[1:58:45] might think about it
[1:58:47] and you'd say well i
[1:58:49] i want to come back to the word i want
[1:58:51] to come back and line up i believe the
[1:58:53] holy spirit's speaking to me tonight
[1:58:56] and i have some repentance to do lift
[1:58:58] your hand up
[1:59:00] yes uh yes all over my
[1:59:03] yes god bless you my my my my
[1:59:06] amen
[1:59:08] amen
[1:59:09] i believe it's actually the majority but
[1:59:10] let's stand to our feet
[1:59:13] all of us together if you will
[1:59:16] heavenly father
[1:59:18] we love you
[1:59:20] lord my hand also i
[1:59:22] lord you know how that i neglect
[1:59:25] many times
[1:59:26] and lord it's because we're not
[1:59:29] conscious always of your presence
[1:59:32] but you've brought yourself on the scene
[1:59:33] as the chief shepherd
[1:59:36] and you're here
[1:59:37] and if there's anything the gates of
[1:59:39] hell is against they're not against the
[1:59:40] denomination they're not even against
[1:59:42] the so-called message churches
[1:59:44] but the gates of hell are against the
[1:59:46] revelation of jesus christ being present
[1:59:49] now being here now
[1:59:51] lord you've taken your
[1:59:53] your man but you didn't take your spirit
[1:59:56] you're here to present to yourself
[1:59:59] a bride without spot or blemish
[2:00:03] our prophet said even as john said when
[2:00:05] christ came on the scene i must decrease
[2:00:07] that he might increase
[2:00:10] oh lord jesus you vindicated your
[2:00:13] presence
[2:00:14] in
[2:00:14] around and around the world
[2:00:17] through the messenger
[2:00:18] oh god and we know
[2:00:21] that you're here lord to present to
[2:00:23] yourself a bride we just want to line up
[2:00:25] i want to line up lord
[2:00:27] and i'm sure those that have uh been
[2:00:30] rejoicing with me tonight and then have
[2:00:33] the courage to lift their hands and say
[2:00:35] i see brother hughes in my life or that
[2:00:38] i need to measure up
[2:00:40] oh god that's the whole purpose of
[2:00:42] coming to church that we might be
[2:00:43] corrected and draw closer to you and
[2:00:46] receive your love which is corrective
[2:00:50] oh father we thank you
[2:00:52] and lord i thank you for this assembly
[2:00:55] may they continue to grow in the grace
[2:00:57] and knowledge of our lord jesus christ
[2:00:59] may the stimulation of revelation always
[2:01:01] be their portion
[2:01:03] oh god
[2:01:04] how we thank you lord for this little
[2:01:07] flock bless them lord give each one
[2:01:10] individually the desires of their heart
[2:01:12] you know what was behind the hand when
[2:01:14] it went up lord
[2:01:15] and lord
[2:01:16] uh that in itself hallelujah to me
[2:01:19] hallelujah
[2:01:20] oh god you don't have to come down and
[2:01:23] storm the building
[2:01:25] but lord that in itself shows that these
[2:01:28] are your children they love you lord
[2:01:31] and oh god i'm sure
[2:01:33] oh god that you love them
[2:01:35] because you've manifested yourself to
[2:01:37] them by revealing yourself to them

[2:01:58] however you'd like to do it i want to
[2:02:01] step out of the way here
[2:02:02] again i want to thank brother
[2:02:06] maybe i should say dr shimbo
[2:02:09] you know i've trusted him to work on my
[2:02:11] mouth
[2:02:13] and
[2:02:14] he's asked me to minister on different
[2:02:16] occasions but i said well i'm going to
[2:02:18] do you just like you done me

[2:02:31] view of my entire mouth
[2:02:34] and
[2:02:35] x-ray after x-ray of course i'm i'm sure
[2:02:37] that wasn't the type of x-ray that's
[2:02:39] zapping all the light out of your body
[2:02:41] but nonetheless
[2:02:43] uh when he asked me to minister then i
[2:02:45] said well i no i'm not tonight i said i
[2:02:47] sit and listen to him minister i said
[2:02:49] i'm just here to take some x-rays

[2:07:16] from

[2:07:22] [Music]
[2:07:37] is that your prayer tonight let's give
[2:07:40] him a big clap of him
[2:07:47] hallelujah
[2:07:50] do you see how god is wonderful
[2:07:55] those who were here on saturday
[2:07:58] we dealt with the evidence of the holy
[2:08:00] spirit
[2:08:01] and then on sunday
[2:08:05] it looks like brother hughes was here on
[2:08:07] sunday
[2:08:07] [Music]
[2:08:09] amen
[2:08:10] it is not me buddy
[2:08:12] it is the holy spirit
[2:08:15] it's a language of god
[2:08:17] he's pointing you something
[2:08:20] amen
[2:08:21] he's insisting and confirming that i am
[2:08:24] exactly the one who's bringing this
[2:08:27] thing to you
[2:08:28] amen
[2:08:29] because brother yours is coming way
[2:08:32] south carolina he was not here you might
[2:08:34] say maybe on sunday he might have heard
[2:08:38] us on youtube
[2:08:39] but on saturday it was not recorded
[2:08:44] he was questioned and answered on the
[2:08:45] evidence of the holy spirit
[2:08:48] it was not recorded
[2:08:50] so it is purely the holy spirit
[2:08:54] clearly the spirit of the lord
[2:08:56] moving amen
[2:08:58] and we thank the lord he could move
[2:09:00] aside and be
[2:09:02] led by the spirit of god to nail on the
[2:09:05] seven spirit of god the seven stars and
[2:09:08] everything on the money right there in
[2:09:11] line like he was in service
[2:09:13] amen
[2:09:14] brother use your father-in-law did he
[2:09:17] have a vision or was it a dream
[2:09:20] he said the lord spoke to him already
[2:09:23] you don't know
[2:09:24] yet it's the sister that was the dreamer
[2:09:28] the sister was the dreamer
[2:09:30] okay yeah
[2:09:31] because there is a hidden message in
[2:09:33] that
[2:09:34] in what he was
[2:09:35] saying at the beginning it's a whole
[2:09:38] message that is coming up
[2:09:40] amen
[2:09:41] amen
[2:09:42] it's a marriage of a man and a woman
[2:09:45] through the office of the voice of god
[2:09:49] for the day it's a message
[2:09:51] it was a message hidden right there i
[2:09:53] caught the language ready amen it was
[2:09:56] not his marriage
[2:09:57] he thought he was giving a testimony but
[2:10:00] he was not giving a testimony he was
[2:10:02] talking about the marriage of the lamb
[2:10:06] amen
[2:10:07] the marriage of the lamb you remember on
[2:10:09] sunday those virgins were only
[2:10:12] engaged they were only a spouse but the
[2:10:16] marriage was not yet
[2:10:18] amen
[2:10:19] and guess what brother used pastor
[2:10:21] before he was married
[2:10:23] and jesus christ was the great shepherd
[2:10:26] he said in john chapter 10 that he was a
[2:10:28] shepherd but he was not married yet
[2:10:34] everybody here
[2:10:36] he's gone he's getting married now
[2:10:38] but he was already the pastor
[2:10:41] so it was not your testimony i can pull
[2:10:44] the whole message that i already have
[2:10:46] for the church
[2:10:48] anybody here
[2:10:52] and the evidence came from a man
[2:10:54] and a woman
[2:10:56] his father-in-law was a man
[2:10:58] he said the lord spoke to him
[2:11:00] but the woman got a dream
[2:11:04] there is a reason why that woman must
[2:11:06] have a dream and the men have to speak
[2:11:08] the evidence is coming from a man and
[2:11:10] from a woman about his wedding
[2:11:16] you know a dream
[2:11:18] meaning you're sleeping
[2:11:20] and you know the scent slipped through
[2:11:22] the edges
[2:11:25] right
[2:11:26] right
[2:11:27] so the marriage is coming from those
[2:11:29] sleeping and those that are awake
[2:11:32] because you have to wake one at one in
[2:11:34] the night
[2:11:40] you see how i read that
[2:11:44] everybody here
[2:11:45] and what did his wife keep repeating all
[2:11:48] the time
[2:11:50] where did ruff fell at the feet of who
[2:11:53] boasts meaning
[2:11:56] [Applause]
[2:11:57] [Music]
[2:11:59] [Applause]
[2:12:04] you see how the spirit of the lord moved
[2:12:06] you thought he was giving his testimony
[2:12:09] he was wrapping up the marriage of the
[2:12:11] lamb completely and even what have been
[2:12:13] preached here
[2:12:15] [Music]
[2:12:17] amen brother branham said the reason why
[2:12:20] ruth wanted defeat because she was not
[2:12:22] worthy
[2:12:23] and the woman kept repeating i am not
[2:12:25] worthy i am not worthy i am not worthy
[2:12:28] and the prophet said the one who is not
[2:12:30] worthy that's roof
[2:12:32] that's the brand
[2:12:39] hallelujah
[2:12:40] glory to god i already got a
[2:12:42] confirmation for the message
[2:12:44] so you keep praying we appreciate you
[2:12:46] brother you thank you very much for
[2:12:49] yielding to the holy spirit that was the
[2:12:52] spirit of the lord speaking amen you
[2:12:54] didn't understand why they were pulling
[2:12:56] you were right in line
[2:12:59] amen let's give the lord one more big
[2:13:01] clap
