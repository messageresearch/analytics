amen these little places as David could not build the true Tabernacle of God because he wasn't prepared to do it there was nothing he could do he was the Marlin shed blood so is it today to us we are

you very much we greet you all in the precious name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen how many are up to date with the sermon amen amen so basically what we're going to enter with today is just a result of what has been built all over amen so if you miss one or two sermon you probably can get lost easily so stay up and everything will be okay amen we have a wonderful meeting yesterday and I believe it's probably three hours service Wonderful Wonderful by the grace of God we recorded and I will talk to the Deacon and see if anybody want to review it over because there was a lot of scripture that have been given so they can make it available to the church not for you to take it and begin to send to the people outside it is for this church I know there is a lot of material a lot of scripture that was laid down which can help somebody else but before he goes out you need to ask permission for me amen so it's for this church give it to the church and let the church grow into the Lord and understand the real purpose of God what are we doing in this life and the purpose that God sent us here in this one amen so if you miss it you were not there make sure you contact the Deacon I will talk to them brother Kelly and brother Robert to see how we can make it available with Brother David because we record it so we know how to get it in other words do not operate if you didn't get that instruction because you're going to cause a traffic and we don't want to be in the traffic we want to clear the hour for the Lord and clear the highway you can see what happened this morning I told you you can see what happened a man came in the book came in the morning car parked on the parking lot and everything that is God doing this amen so if you miss it go back and talk to me so you can sit and review this word by word and make sure you really grasp the concept and once you catch it I don't have to tell you anything amen so don't come sing here if you don't know what we were talking about amen because you can come out here and be out of line and be a target for the devil I don't want you to be a Target where the devil will continue to use you to trouble The Host the god want to use you to be a blessing to the host so let's be blessing to one another and for the Bride of Jesus Christ all over the world Amen we apologize for Wednesday we lost a little bit of chunk of it especially those online or those that were at home could not make it for a legitimate reason I apologize maybe if there is any question when we go to our question and answer on December 17th you can bring out those questions and we can kind of make sure everybody is on the same page amen so we apologize by God's grace we already bought the the the recorder the new recorder and we're gonna try to wire everything so we will have a recording going on YouTube and a recording going directly here so if something happened we have a backup automatically the first is having one route amen so praise be to the name of the Lord so let's go straight to our scripture this morning very familiar scripture but like I told you on Wednesday scripture have layers amen you can look at one verse the first time you see something the second time you see something and it's amazing the way the scripture are written amen I can take one verse and preach the serpent seed out of it and when you look at that you don't see the serpent seed with your eyes you just take the Holy Spirit to unfold it amen and once the holy spirit unfolded that same holy spirit will come back up again and show you maybe one word and that word when you open you see five sermon laying under amen that's how the word of God is glory to God let's go to Genesis chapter 2. verse 7. amen looks like everything working fine glory to God Hallelujah Genesis chapter 2 verse 7. you might say we read this a lot of time brother Stephen he's a whole lot in this world amen we can preach Genesis for three four years amen and the Lord God formed man Out of the Dust of the ground and breathe into his nostril the breath of life and Man became a living Soul you might be seated we know that we got two men we got the man in the spirit amen which is Genesis 1 26-28 and we got man in the body which is Genesis 2 7. amen glory to God drop to verse 18. the Bible says and the Lord God said it is not good that the man should be alone is my volume okay amen I will make him a help meet for him so remember in the spirit man was double everybody okay man was male and female amen you got the microphone but killed yes sir okay praise God Amen and out of the ground the Lord God verse 19 form every beast of the field and every fowl of the air and brought them to Adam to do what to see what we call them God wanted to test war was in Adam amen God created Adam and he knew the software he put in Adam amen so he created all the beasts the cattle and everything and brought them to Adam so that he can test the software he put in Adam I'm saying that way so you can really catch what I'm trying to say to test when I say software I'm talking about the mind so God had the mind that he put in Adam everybody okay and when he put we on the computer last time so when I talk that language you can get it quickly okay I'm not calling the mind of God the software I'm just making a point like when we say the black dog the white dog we don't mean the holy spirit is a dog it is a type okay amen so when God had the mind that he put into Adam so God wanted to see to test the mind that he put an Adam how is the mind of Adam amen in continuity with his own mind everybody okay because Man was created in the image and in the likeness of water God so man was a replica of God so God want to see if his mind is in Adam so the only way to test his mind is bring an animal before Adam so that Adam will Express the son of man foreign have to come up with the name of the Beast and that name must be exactly the name that God already have in his mind everybody okay everybody okay so nobody can give Adam the name Adam must be able to look at you and say you are uh everybody okay you gotta clear everybody okay Adam must look up and they say you know what you are cephas you got that one you guys see first oh who is there oh oh this is Nathaniel this is an Israelite where there is no God and Natalia say wait a minute who told you about me I don't need anybody to tell me I have the mind of God everybody okay you see how the son of man is hidden here and you can read it over and over and you don't see the son of man that's why God wanted to see he wants to test what he put in Adam let me see how we work is he working correctly Adam said this one is an elephant god say check next next next that's why Adam could call either woo man in other words the revelation of Adam was nothing but God everybody okay verse 19 and he brought them to Adam to see what he would call them and whatsoever Adam did what in other words everything that came from the mouth of God Adam nothing failed everybody okay in other words Adam had the ministry of infallibility everybody okay he was not deceived you remember on Wednesday he did it purposely with his eyes open in other words every time you're gonna bring a an animal on the platform yeah do you really get me every time you're gonna bring an elephant on his platform whoever passes there none of them will fail every time you're gonna bring your patient on the pulpit every time somebody's coming on a prayer line his discernment will never fail seven come around the world never fail thank you [Applause] glory to God everybody okay my God whatsoever Adam called every creature that was the name thereof no contradiction between him and God everybody okay verse 20 and Adam gave name to all cattle and to the file of the air and to every beast of the field but for Adam they was not found a help from a help meet for him everybody okay glory to God who first say that it is not good for Adam to be alone God so who start the problem about Adam being alone God did Adam complain no so the very origin of a wife that's why the Bible say whoever found the wife find a good thing if you have a trouble with your wife maybe something is wrong amen who started the idea of a woman God that idea was not contradicting what was here it's always started from eternity dropping down dropping down God look he said wait a minute this man is walking alone he's not supposed to walk alone somebody needs to walk with him to reflect what was here amen so a wife cannot be a traffic to your life everybody okay a wife should be a complementary to your life when you get married you should feel like my God now I feel much better much better than my parents house [Applause] everybody clear everybody here have you ever went to your parents house after you got married and you stayed there for two days you don't want to stay too long you'll be like you know what I need to go back to my house what is in your house that is better than your parent's house you live in your parents house for years but now you don't want to take a longer vacation that bedroom don't fit you you want to go home [Applause] everybody okay [Applause] I am sorry I gotta Lay You Down amen we are message Believers we must be happy in our marriages [Applause] [Music] oh my God [Applause] you are pulling me off the the the the highway amen so God started amen verse 21 and the Lord God calls a water a deep sleep to fall to her Adam who calls Adam to sleep God calls Adam to sleep why amen and he slept and he who's the he God took one of his rib so who punched Adam God the very thought of Eve started from God the one who need to make Eve amen is not Adam it is the one who started the talk he's the one who have to make a abroad not anybody else everybody okay thank God and Adam slept and he took one of the his rib and closed up the flesh instead thereof did Adam see this he was completely asleep amen God pulled something out watch carefully at the rib so there is a pudding to sleep of Adam a pudding to sleep of Adam amen through this sleep they pull something out of it amen they pull a piece of river out amen Adam stays sleeping everybody okay nothing to do with it it's God watch verse 22. and the weave which the Lord God has taken from man when God pulled something from Adam God didn't pull a complete woman everybody okay he only picked a rib everybody okay if they show you that rib it doesn't look really like a woman everybody okay but it's a woman amen but Adam cannot get married to a reap Adam cannot be working with Serena everybody okay that we need to be worked on we okay are you following me I want you to get the picture so you can swallow what is coming up amen and they read which the Lord God has taken from man made he a water woman so this Rib was transformed from a rib into a full grown-up woman everybody okay everybody okay everybody okay so at the beginning after the surgery amen what you look at is a river everybody okay you cannot marry Adam to a river everybody okay so there was a period of time you're following me there is a period of time after they put into sleep of Adam amen that God had to make abroad I don't know if you following me if I lost you raise your hand [Applause] pay attention my friend God you need to know how to read the scripture God didn't come and reap Adam and put Adam and Paul and Eve came out that's not the way he went God have to give him an anesthesia first and the Anastasia worked slowly because it's a slip so Adam somehow after he demonstrated the son of man Ministry he began to feel a little bit sleepy everybody okay everybody okay he begins to be a little bit sleepy Adam say father I don't know let me give me some time I need to take a nap and God was watching him and Adam went went and he went to sleep when he went to sleep God look he said perfect time he went Assad and punch him everybody okay and then he pulled the river the rib doesn't look like a human being everybody okay so God have to God needed some time everybody okay that he can take the weave and begin to work on the rib to make the rib to become a woman [Applause] everybody okay so there was a period of time a period of time in the making of the brother all right everybody care another word when the bride is pulled from the side she is not complete yet [Applause] God needed some time to work on the pride until he completes the bread [Applause] everybody okay glory to God everybody okay now verse 22 and the rib which the Lord God has taken from man made he a water a woman a woman and brought her to who the man stop right there if God have to take the rib and make it a woman and bring that woman back to Adam it means that where God was working in his manufacture amen Adam was not dead [Applause] what I'm trying to say is this there was a distance between where Adam sleep and where God was working So Adam was away everybody followed me when God is working on the bread Adam must be away everybody okay so when God finished he looked at the woman brother Branham said it was a perfect type of a woman Eve was created by God and designed by God [Applause] not what you had before like Satan came and begin to work on Eve that's a lie everybody care everybody care that's not what brother Branham saying we already explained you that anybody okay God made the ease and Adam was a little bit away everybody okay so when God finished making Eve somehow Adam begin to come out from sleep everybody okay when Adam woke up there was nobody around but here he looked God is Not There he said maybe I'm gonna see him in the evening time this is the time that God usually come and talk to me everybody okay then God has to pick Eve from that distance and take ease and begin to bring her closely to Adam foreign I'm trying to say is not only is there a period of time of the making of the bread but there is also a distance between where Adam is amen and where is is amen and he will take God himself I don't know if you're getting me the one who say it is not good for Adam to be alone was who God the one who punched Adam was who God the one who pulled the whip was who God the one who created the woman was who so since he started from God he is the author and the water finisher and the finisher of your faith once you start something if he is Alpha he have to be the Omega if God started your marriage your marriage will not help if your marriage started from God he will not care no matter how much difficulty you going through your marriage if God started it God will finish your marriage what God has put together like what no man put in water asunder [Music] everybody okay everybody okay everybody okay so nobody nobody can take ease to Adam amen nobody no preacher [Applause] everybody okay everybody okay he have to be God himself who started the word to take the bread and to marry the brother [Applause] in other words the marriage of Adam have to be done by God himself [Applause] the marriage of Adam have to be done by whom God himself and what God has jumped together let water no man [Music] verse 22 you need to be gracious with me on time because time is running quickly for me let's go to verse 23. Genesis 2 23. and Adam say this is not water born of my body remember he already have the mind of God so whatever God was doing there somehow Adam didn't have that Revelation was tormenting Adam but when Adam saw is a revelation open up Adam say hey I never seen this Revelation before I have lived in this world I grew up with my sister I grew up with my mother but I never seen a woman like this one he's seen a lot of women in high school he's seen a lot of women in the on the street he have seen a lot of women in Walmart but there is something different about this woman [Applause] thank you [Applause] you talk to married people amen you say what did you see said man I never seen that she wants that beautiful you were with her all the time in the church where did that beauty come from a revelation open up your eyes change you begin to look at her differently yeah everybody okay now Adam said this is now born of my bone and Flesh of My Flesh she shall be called a water a woman who gave the name again so what Adam says is perfectly in line with What God Says everybody okay because she was taken out of water man so the revelation of Adam is always correct when God put Adam to sleep did Adam knew what was happening no amen when God finished the surgery do you think he left his car everybody okay so when God took Eve away was Adam there when God was making him how did Adam knew that Eve came out of him how did Adam knew when Adam just looked he said you you came out of me how did he know that Adam had the mind of God everybody okay that's why he knew all things everybody okay glory to God he said therefore verse 24 shall a man leave his father and his mother and shall be cling to his water why and there shall be water one flesh because they came from the to you they look too flesh this is my wife's brother Stephen this is me that's what you think yeah but you're not too flesh you were too flesh when she was in her parents house but since you got married you got one flesh that's why whatever happened between you and her God doesn't seed are you catching me are you catching me God is Not There oh it is it is one flesh what's the problem I don't know if you're catching me God doesn't see it he doesn't even pay attention brother said put your hand on your wife does he bother you does he bother you oh that's a man touching a woman why he doesn't bother you but let a young man put the hand on the young woman before I leave this church I will help people line up over there why did brother so and so did this why is that one not bothering you why it doesn't bother you have you ever thought because the day we marry somebody here God goes in every one of you and he take away that stuff away the same people that were telling you no no no no you need to protect yourself you're not married yet okay be careful the day of marriage when brother Stephen say upon the authority that God given me I pronounce you husband and wife you the same one who was so legalistic you are the first one to say brother hold your wife hold them like this hold the hair like this move her with oh when he's a little bit he said don't be too shy but you are the one telling her not to hold the wife [Applause] at that point when he does this when when we go to a wedding you start sitting there what do you want to see [Applause] what do you want to see I thought that was bad it was bad before but now that is John together he won't bother you anymore why because they become one flesh God bless you Mama good to see you she might need the translation stuff amen glory to God Amen let's go now to verse uh 25. and they were above water make it the man and his wife and were not water a shame why one flesh nothing happened two flesh that's when you get in trouble because you are still in your parents house everybody okay let's go to Genesis 5. glory to God if you dare you can say amen amen Genesis 5 verse 1 and 2 glory to God remember there is a period from the punching of Adam that God have to take a period of time to make the bread and when the period of time is finished and the bread is completed God himself nobody else have to be responsible to take the blood and to bring the bread back to Adam to marry Adam and bringing back something from each original because Eve was here everybody here and Eve is now out as a rib and she immorphic from a rib into a human being when Eve is completed Eve doesn't belong to God he was in Adam so God must take Eve back to Adam The Taking of Eve back to Adam is what we call marriage everybody okay The Taking of Eve back to her original position is called marriage and because we are taking Eve back to her husband it is also Redemption [Applause] it's a great mystery so marriage is a Redemption when we are marrying somebody we are really telling this woman that you came from this man and we're telling the brother brother you were missing a party now your party is back here you take care and you continue with it and from that time your life amen cannot be selfish anymore I don't know why I'm saying this amen amen the phone call of your wife cannot be a disturbance I don't know if you get me do you want her to call who you want her to call who everybody okay she needs to know where you are [Applause] if you took so long you need to give her a report where did you stop yeah everybody okay because she's part of you if you're not ready for this don't get married stay at your parents house play with yourself until 4am in the morning but not when you are married you need to put that cell phone down [Applause] at block right there I can't get to the other let's go to verse one this is the book of the generation of Adam in the day that God created man in the likeness of who God made he him have male and female you see it right here we went through this already male and female amen created he them amen and blessed them in a spirit and call their name the name of Adam is not the name of a male amen God called Dead plural he blessed them plural So Adam and his wife both of them have one name Adam so when you call Adam you are calling two people everybody okay everybody okay I'm am I reading the Bible [Applause] can you verify in your Bible God called their name water Adam so Eve is Adam in a feminine version if you want to see Adam how he looked like a woman it's easy it came after the fall the name of Eve was given after the fall you know that right amen it's in Genesis chapter 3 after he fell then Adam gave Eve another name because Adam seen the serpency everybody okay but the name of Adam means is a demand you okay he called their name Adam in the day when they were water let's go to Ephesians 5 then we saw with these fast I don't know five sermon that we preach your marriage should be changing in this church your marriages should be changing if your husband didn't listen to the five sermon we went through get him get him home on his day off if he gives you trouble give me a call I will come to visit him and me and him will watch the discernment make him sit down and watch the sermon so you can live a peaceful life not a headache home everybody okay Ephesians 5 23 if you dare you can say amen amen for the husband is the head of the water wife we already explained you this amen according to God if this is Adam if this is a man amen this head here is the man this part here is the bride is the head we already shown you that the head the head the head they had the head is a man this head is the head the head the head the head is why is the head coming in the last day [Applause] [Music] [Applause] did you see seven angels coming in the time of power did you see them coming in the middle age why is only at this time that the head must come you want the head to be married to a rib are we okay are we okay for the husband you're gonna understand the message very clearly and the purpose of this message I believe the five sermon we went through I don't know four or five you should see clearly why we have the message of the center for the husband is the head of the wife even as who Christ so Christ is who even as Christ is the head of the water church the church and he is the savior of water the body so crushed the head of the church and this is his body and his body is the bride [Applause] complicated jump to verse 25. you there husband love your wife even as Christ also loves the church and gave himself for it so the love you must love your wife is not a natural love it is not in Hollywood love it is the love of God so for you to love like God you must have God that's why brother Branham said before you get married you need the Holy Ghost so the Holy Ghost when he's in you he will bring the love of God in you so that you can love your wife with the love of God that's how God wants you to love your wife okay we already went through this even as God loves the church Christ loved the church and gave himself for it

needs to come down on Sunset Mountain and he's bringing the messages and when he bring the message he needs to hand it to the messenger and when the messenger begin to preach God stand behind him when he finished God come out and God talked to his brother so he himself is presenting to himself [Applause] that's why brother Branham said you are not feeding on the word of a man [Applause] I know how many times have you heard brother Branham say sister you know the one that was talking to you he was not me everybody care because God has left there and he goes again and stand here amen and when you want to talk he goes back again to brother Branham he said go ahead and do this do this and he goes back again he's flipping Ministry that is a shifting of ministry sometimes it's the son of God and sometimes it's the son of man we will get to that next time everybody okay verse 27 that he may present to it himself a glorious Church already 40 minute government not having water spots or water Winkle who took the spot away he did who took the wrinkle away what do you have to do so all you have to do when he's coming just sit quiet don't tell him what to do he knows how to give you a detail

thinking about it he got so much in your life [Applause] laughs that he might not have exporter Rico or any such thing but it should be half holy and without water blemish so ought to men everything I explained to you this is how a husband so ought to men to do what love the wise you see you see now that you love a woman it's more than what we think it's more the Hollywood amen amen amen and he does love his wife himself let me leave it alone job to verse 30. for we are members of his water body oil for his water flesh of his water bombs for this cause shall men leave his father now you see now and his mother and shall be joined to his water why and the truth shall be water one flesh this is a great mystery do you see it's easy it's a great one this is a great mystery but I speak concerning who Christ and the Water Church let's pray Heavenly Father Lord once again we are approaching you humbly father have you read the scripture to the best of the ability you have given us Lord once again we pray that you may come and minister to your children may you move me completely Assad may you come and bless this congregation and those that are streaming Lord in the name of Jesus Christ amen glory to God my subject this morning don't start okay we already butchered my subject this morning is the four phases of roof Redemption and the greater Redemption bringing back to original position and the great mystery which is about Christ and his church marriage everybody okay we are on the threshing floor with roof it's part 48. well roof now is entering at the rest and rest according to the Book of Ruth as a mean going and just going to sleep rest according to the Book of Ruth means marriage but it was not just easy as far as much as roof have to get in got married and I will say no the marriage of roof never happened like that the marriage of roof was a marriage that was coupled with the work of redemption before Boaz can marry roof borrowers must first of all gave her six measure of value everybody okay you know what he means now okay because Boaz was the seventh one it is the seventh that give the sixth it is the seventh seal that opened the six sided everybody okay in other words the seals must be broken that's right everybody okay and when the seals are broken then boys have to go back to finish the work of redemption and come back and pick up roof hey everybody okay so what's the seals are broken it tells you where you are in Redemption and right here so when you hear the opening of the seals it tells you that the bridegroom has already unfolded himself amen now he's going back to deal with something and when he comes back he's coming to pick you up everybody okay so since the opening of the seals the instructions were given to roof get the food go home get the sixth measure of Valley go home this measure of ballet will give you food to eat until I come back to get you [Applause] everybody okay everybody okay so that's why the opening of the seals brought the full word into manifestation while the bridegroom is finishing the work of redemption [Applause] everybody okay have I lost you now according to Matthew 25 we found out that we got the parable of the uh ten virgins amen if you recall that we have two vessels you remember there was one vessel that was connected to a lamp [Music] there was two vessels there was one vessel that was connected to a lamp and that vessel was burning amen and this land were given to the bride to be because five of them realized they were not Brad everybody okay only five were born amen and there was another vessel anybody follow me that was not used that vessels was the one that was contending the oil of Reserve everybody okay and this all was a refilling when the first all is completely gone and everybody okay the first oil that was here and the second all are the same everybody following me this oil and this oil came up from one everybody okay but these two all are separated based on what they're doing everybody okay this oil helped the bread or the Virgin to move all the time amen but whatever they were doing or traveling the bread groom was not there everybody okay so it's an oil that work when the bridegroom is not there everybody okay are you following me but when the bridegroom came everybody okay the oil have to be flipped amen from a banol of Brad to be everybody okay to annoying of the groom amen and only those that have the oil of Reserve where they want that qualify to enter into the marriage that's why we call this oil the first oil and this oil we call it the water so the fish oil have to deal with the broad bombing in the absence of the groom everybody okay but the second oil was the oil that was burning only when the Gloom has come everybody okay so the groom is a man everybody okay are you following me and the Bride is a female everybody okay so these two oil are one everybody are following me yet they have two Ministry one will burn for the female but the other one will bring only when the male comes [Music] have I lost anyone have I lost anyone Now by looking at the oil we got the oil I mean the the vessel that is connected to the lamp and another vessel that is not connected to the lamb but it's only a a used or utilized when the groom comes because it's the all of the groom it is a male oil and there is a female oil but both of those oil are when we go back again and pulling the candlestick everybody okay we found out that the Candlestick had also a ball ready and about them right here everybody okay there was a bull at the bottom right here now this Candlestick are not seven lamps everybody okay they are one limp everybody okay divided in seven everybody okay but the ball is still one we didn't have seven boats no everybody okay he was one ball feeding seven laps but all this lamp are just one and we know according to the Book of Revelation there Candlestick represented the church amen and the church was not only one church but it was seven Church and all seven churches have only one boy everybody okay everybody okay and these seven Church make up what we call the Bride of Jesus Christ did I lost anybody brother Brandon says this glory to God oh my God let me see if I can get it here amen he says now examine this lamp stand you will notice that if he had that he has a large bowl a reservoir that is essential to seven arms that come out of it this ball is filled with olive oil which flows through the water seven weeks which are placed in the seven everybody okay it is the same old that burns and make a light at the end of the seven water pipes so those right together are one light you cannot take one two three no you take just one Candlestick but you go with the Candlestick and it gives you light for seven amen you don't take one Candlestick only no when you poop when you when you pick up the ball you picking up seven Lane you cannot separate them if you take one out you don't have the candlestick everybody okay brother Branham said the original outpouring of Pentecost which our poem came direct from who Jesus on The Mercy Seat is undoing his church through all the seven churches and showing perfectly showing forth perfectly that Jesus Christ is the same today to end today and water forever they never changing God in his Essence and in his whatever ways so there is one source feeding seven land everybody okay get closer now glory to God brother Branham say heart thrilling it is to think that those seven lamps showing life and like from the source of the water main boy only one ball because they had their weak deep during everybody okay each Church age messenger is depicted here his life is on fire with the Holy Ghost he's weak his life has been immersed into what Christ so this ball here is Christ yes everybody okay now back all that pretty good okay because we need to chew up some stuff brother Branham said he was not that God don't deal with a person in a group God don't deal with you either organization he deals with you as water individual an individual and individually we are baptized with the Holy Ghost collectively everybody okay so we have an individual walk everybody okay I told you tubercula and we have a collective walk everybody okay individual is between you the person and Jesus Christ himself everybody care but collectively because the body of Jesus Christ is not one person it is many members but everybody okay everybody okay everybody okay this is a church this is a church this is a church this is a church this is a church this is a church this is a church individually you following me we have seven Church ages each other just have its own messenger amen and each Church edges have its own group of people that receives the messenger of that time and that are born into the body of Jesus Christ so individually we have seven churches but collectively Everybody follow me collectively we only have one brother [Applause] did I lose you even though we have seven Church edges all these seven churches all of them together are the Bride of Jesus Christ individually it's seven churches but collectively it's one bread of Jesus Christ but one bride in seven three changes everybody okay everybody okay I told you individually we are baptized with the Holy Ghost collectively we are baptized into the body when we are baptized with the water so when God gives you the Holy Ghost individually God has sealed and tell you that I have approved your faith you are my brother But as God is selling you everybody okay you are now part not only of the Holy Ghost but you are part of the blood of Jesus Christ internationally everybody okay so now you have brothers and sisters in Africa in Asia in America in Europe that are also baptized with the Holy Ghost just like you because out of every nation every tongue every people God will draw abroad for himself [Applause] I hope we're getting that glory to God individually each one baptized with the Holy Ghost God deal with each one individually that was his purpose scatter them across the Earth so he could deal individually with them everybody okay watch this here we are in the end time coming from the East to the west north and south what are we doing getting ready for water Rapture getting ready holding ourselves steady for a few minutes till every father calling the people together too himself is that in the true Oneness with himself because it is his what Holy Spirit he's what one one Holy Spirit by What Spirit we are are individually baptized into one body collectively the body of Jesus Christ everybody okay so you are the Bride of Jesus Christ she is the blood of Jesus Christ that's why Paul said in Christ there is no man and what female because all of us we are one but individually you're a woman he is a brother she's a sister but collectively God look at both of us as one person the Bride of Jesus Christ everybody creates so far brother Branham say and Jesus Christ living with his spirit in our flesh is serving the church and doing the same thing he did as a son as a Nissan to the world that we are in the last thing getting ready for the water Rapture everybody okay follow me carefully even though the Holy Ghost are you ready come on the day of Pentecost you following me and I'll pull itself on the day of Pentecost everybody okay the Holy Ghost still existed everybody okay on the day of Pentecostal the pillar of fire came and divided himself remember onto a 120 people according to the need of that hand everybody okay we thought the Holy Ghost was finished everybody okay but we found out that when Paul met Jesus Christ on the road to Damascus the same Pillar of Fire was still there in his fullness [Applause] the holy ghost that entered the 120 never came out of it opens first John chapter one now we're sorry I'm good in time John 1 if you dare you can say man John 1 verse uh verse 18. if you dare you can say amen amen go to verse 16. I'm sorry you there amen amen the Bible says amen and of his what fullness have we water received have we all received have have all we receive and water Grace for water Grace so there is how many fullness one fullness but all of us we are receiving from that one fullness when you're receiving that you're not changing that person open second king chapter four before somebody struggled second king chapter four glory to God amen open second king chapter four you there amen first one now they cry a certain woman of the wives of the sons of the prophet to Elisha saying your servant my husband is dead and you know that your servant did feel the Lord and the Creditor is come to take to him my two sons to be bondsmen to be slave everybody okay watch carefully and the Lord shall say to her what shall I do for you tell me what they have you in the house and she said your husband has not anything in the house save a water a pot of oil so there was a vessel in the house of this woman and that vessel was filled with oil everybody following me when you enter the woman first house you only see one vessel when you look there is only one vessel the woman said there is nothing in the house only what one vessel of owing everybody okay let's see what happened then verse 3 he said go and do whatever he's borrowing borrow you vessels April of all your water Neighbors walk on the faces my question do all the vessel have the same size somewhere somewhere somewhere small the problem is God to your neighbor and just wow get a big truck you stop to your neighbor do you have an empty vessel you put it there do you have an empty vessel do you put there Who's Gonna Fill those vessels everybody okay everybody okay job to First are we on first third three then he said go you go borrow theirselves abroad borrow your vessels abroad of all your neighbor empty vessels borrow not water in other words borrow many so there is one vessel that I have Owen but there is many vessels everybody okay Dada coming from different houses but all those vessels are empty they are coming from different houses they are coming from South Carolina from North Carolina from Canada from South America from Africa borrow those vessels bring them up make sure they are empty if there is something there dump it dump it down perfect I think that is in that person being defensive empty God doesn't want anything [Applause] everybody okay verse 4 and when you are coming you shall do water shut the door it's a secret upon you am I reading a different Bible you shall shut the door upon you and upon your sons and you shall do at him oh well into water all those versions stop do we know the number of the vessels did Elisha say a number of the vessels so if this woman bring a million vessels or if this woman bring two vessels or if she bring a hundred million Versa he does a mother as far as you can borrow but did I just said don't bring to you ask many ask a lot everybody okay everybody okay everybody okay now this woman come with an 18 trailer author of vessels she put them one by one where is the all coming up now let's take a number let's pick up a number I'm gonna pick up a million because I want to be thinking big everybody okay I pick a million vessels and we put it in the house so it must be a big house so we close the door amen some of the vessels are small like this your faith will quick quickly yes this vessel that we have in the house is big so when we put in the small it's gonna feel one two three four what about when you get to ten that vessel will be empty amen because there is another big vessel that probably look bigger than the one that is in the house are you following me what are we gonna do Who's Gonna Fill those vessels in other words if the vessel is this size maybe there was the woman borrow a big I mean a big bad world I don't know something bigger like this how is this oil filled this one [Music] let's see what happened and verse 4 and when you are coming you shall shut the door upon you and upon your sons and shall pour into all those vessels and you shall set aside that which is what for in the house that you talked was one when the prophetic anointing everybody here that's the oil that first self was many vessels into one I don't know if you follow me there was the original oil there was the origin of vessel and now there are many vessels that was brought amen at the beginning all you see was the vessel but you didn't see that in this professor there were many vessels everybody okay Lord help me verse 5 so she went from him and shut it's Elisha it is a double portion of Elijah not one portion but Elijah too comes to Elijah and Elijah Elijah and the second Elijah they give you two Elijah but both Elijah are just one it is just a double portion of the Same Spirit amen Amen brother Branham say Elijah was Christ he said Elisha was the brother so Elisha his ministry need many vessels [Applause] you follow me do you follow me when Elijah went and he left his spirit how many people received that spirit okay but when they come to Elijah Elijah cannot work with one he need many vessels everybody okay in a larger one in a larger one in a larger many the anointing of Elijah and the anointing of Elisha is the same anointing only one is double everybody okay job to verse 4. so she went from him and shut the door hell upon her son who brought the vessels of her and she did water and he came to pass when the vessels my million vessels where for so no vessels was partial wherefore that she said to herself bring me yet water in other words next one next one next one when she reads one when the sun with one million the woman said bring me the next one they say mama there is no more watch what happened everybody care when she said bring me yet if yourself and he said to her there is not a vessels move and he all did what stayed in other words the original ball was still full but out of that one bowl came a million balls everybody okay now when you look you have the original bow and a million ball all of them have oil but those oil are the same but at the beginning all the million all were inside the road everybody are you understanding me so that all that is coming out from the pot is the portion that will fill the specific vessels once the last predestinated vessel is filled the oil will stop because there is no more people that can receive that all [Music] [Applause] are you getting what I'm saying in other words John said ahead of his fullness we are received so everybody who's the Bride of Jesus Christ has a portion of the holy spirit that God predestinated for you when the time come God will dispatch dispatch despite until the last predestinated vessel of the Bride is filled then inside Jesus Christ there is no more oil for the bride [Applause] I don't know if you get me the Brad oil is finished when the last predestinated member of the Bride receive his passion then everything is finished but the original bucket is still full everybody okay now according to Elijah's story we have one oil versus a million oil everybody okay everybody okay this million all came from here everybody okay but now we have the original oil and the million or all these oil are the same what are you trying to say inside this bucket amen this bucket was he and they everybody okay they were a million he was one but he have the ability because John the Baptist say I baptize you with water water but there is one coming after me he will baptize you with water [Applause] so that bucket has to be poor it can be one bucket have to be poor in each age he poor he got the children of God poor got the children of God poor got the children of God poor God the children of God who are gathered children of God poor God the children and all they were all receiving all from Harmony One [Music] everybody care when all these are filled he's still dead as the Eternal Pillar of Fire in other words when you see the pillar of fire here inside brother brought them here there was another portion of the pillar of fire that don't belong to him I'm talking to you so you understand the person that was in here in brother Branham is a specific portion of the pillar of fire unique to brother Branham himself [Applause] everybody okay so that when the big magnet is coming up everybody that have a magnet everybody that have the Holy Ghost will begin to respond quickly when the magnet goes to the right you will see all of you going to the right well the reason why you are behaving that way it is no more you it is Trust the fifth that I live with now it is the faith of the Son of God everybody okay clear everybody okay everybody okay so in the spirit it's male and female in the body also we find out that it's male and female everybody okay oh God help me brother Barnum said this about Jesus Christ he said but remember he went there with you in him see God has never separated the bread from the groom yet so when God looked down upon the body of who because he saw what of melon and water female he was all redeeming to water one body so the body of Jesus Christ also was double everybody okay so what happened to Christ glory to God brother Branham said I want to show you when God gave adam his blood from his side he said Jesus Flesh of My Flesh and born of my bone is that right when God gave Christ his brother the spirit gave the flesh the bride he did what punch and blood and the Spirit come forth that become water flesh and water born of his bones we are the Flesh and Bones the blood will be water the Flesh and the bones of who Christ exactly everybody okay glory to God get ready to swallow this now amen amen Jesus was put to sleep everybody okay just like Adam was put to sleep you're following me when Jesus was put to sleep at the cross because they sleep is death God peace Jesus Christ because Isaiah say Jesus was Smitten by God you know the scripture it's Isaiah 53 he said he was Smitten by God it was God that punch him using a Roman spear that's why all things happen for a reason amen when God pulls Jesus pierced Jesus from the side water and blood came out everybody but what came out there amen Jesus himself did not see it that exactly right I told you you need to swallow this everybody here when the bride was been pulled from Adam I am Adam didn't see Adam was asleep and if you remember God made sure they made sure Jesus was there they touch him they say he's already dead don't touch him anymore and they did what then they please him after he was completely asleep so whatever was happening Jesus was not away everybody okay so what came out of there Jesus didn't see are you following me so God have to take the rib everybody okay that came out of Jesus and just like the first Adam God needed a period of time everybody okay to manufacture the bread God need also a period of time to build the bread of Jesus Christ unto seven Church ages everybody okay so the Bride of power is to leader that's why Paul said I can only espouse you to Jesus Christ amen so the bride have to grow up everybody okay everybody okay the period of time that God took to make the bread of Adam is called to ask the seven churches [Applause] [Music] so the seven churches were in Genesis [Applause] okay everybody okay so God must make the bread until she's a fully grown-up woman when she's fully grown up then God have to take the blood not men God and take the blood and bring it bring her back again everybody okay everybody okay you want to go home swallow this my friend you ready you ready be alert my friend when God made his first break room he made the bridegroom house first Adam was made first and he was both water and woman in water spirit any question we went through this get this from him in the dust of the earth Genesis 2 7 to make him what material and notice when he made if from Adam he took not another piece of water clay because it's going to be contrary to the original there must be born of born and flesh of Flesh he took from the same piece of water clay a rib the same word for Adam was spoken of water God blessed both of them everybody okay and call them one name amen watch carefully he took from him and then taken he had taken the water masculine and what a feminine Spirit can you go higher give him volume because I need volume at this time amen he had masculine and water feminist Spirit he took the feminine spirit away from what Adam and place it in water so it is still part of water Adam's spirit thank you I'm gonna go slowly the spirit that was on his was the spirit of Adam [Applause] everybody okay but he was the feminine spiritual father everybody okay everybody okay the spirit down and say hey everybody okay he's still the spirit of God he was the female [Applause] man he wants the one million that was coming out of one [Applause] I don't know if you catch me the Holy Ghost of Jesus Christ and the holy ghost that we have are one Holy Ghost the first oil and the second Earth are one oil they're only in one million faces and the old on one vessel came up from One Source but the old God came to one million is a feminine oil I have that bridegroom [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] everybody okay the holy ghost that you receive is the female the broad portion of the Holy Ghost it is not different but it qualifies it you as the Bride of Jesus Christ everybody okay everybody okay it is the portion of the Holy Ghost that God reserves for the bread of Jesus Christ God split himself he took a portion of himself he called him but the one who work and the one who's receiving both of them are one I don't know if you're kidding me Eve and Adam are one Eve came out of Adam So Adam cannot give God cannot give Eve a different spirit because she came out from other he need to go to Adam and when God goes to Adam Adam has he's worth what and what a female so he have to take the female part of Adam which is nothing but the spirit of Adam and bring that female apart and put it in other So Adam becomes 50. I don't know if you're kidding me and if also becomes 50 that's why King has service God Esther ask me up to the house for me half of the Kingdom not the whole Kingdom half of the Kingdom [Applause] Have I Lost You Have I Lost You Why do they give us the half of the Kingdom because that's the portion of the pride the broad get half the groom get half and the two when they are put together

Holy Ghost you don't understand what I'm saying amen it is the Holy Ghost but it's only given to the bride amen when God calls you he said that's my brother because you debride because the spirit you have and his Spirit are both one but your spirit that you got Jesus will never recuperated you are sealed when Jesus give it to you he lost it forever because he lost it he want to be with his own Spirit that's why he said I'm going to prepare a place so that where I go you may come and we can live together without you anymore we need to live together work together dance together eat together and matter of fact I won't drink off the wine again until I drink with you in the Kingdom glory to God glory to God [Applause] do you know where I am I am a preacher I am a one-third of the sermon trust me my friend I sat at home I said today I'm gonna get it I can't even move everybody okay brother Branham say he took the water feminist spirit away from who Adam and press it in her Eve so it is still part of what it is Adam's what the Flesh and then it was Adam Spirit the water the mamic that quick and death mechanic of the water his body everybody okay everybody okay hope you will swallow this Lord help me so when God poured that Spirit on the day of Pentecost he's not put that's why on the day of Pentecost he filled 120 and the pillar of fire is still full because it's the big pot he's just giving the portion how many are here 120. that say how many are in here 200. but he's still there until the last predestinated then when he will look at the portion of the brother he said there is no more so all my children are full okay now let me go to the Rapture and let me pick them up [Applause] everybody okay because when he come in the Rapture he doesn't want to guess amen amen when he's coming in the Rapture he doesn't want to guess whoever have the magnet will be feeling it when you have the magnet suddenly you will leave and you begin to go up [Applause] brother Branham says this God needed a period of time to build the Bride of Adam now Jesus is punch the bread came out Jesus a walk he doesn't see any bread God begin to work with the bride Ephesus because Jesus is away Adam was away when God was fabricating the brand so when the bread finished then the marriage of the Lamb has come and here's Brad has a man to herself ready everybody okay he said now from this then bringing this into water seven churches God is water building is in water bribe for Christ is Jesus here Adam must be away when the making his bread so that the day he will see you he will say this is flesh of muffins born of my body he said you the one that was looking all this time finally we can be together everybody okay he says through water Philadelphia it's your church that Jesus said if the bridegroom come in the first what what or the seventh what what all this virgin did what Awakening they were they awoke the virgin of Ephesus smell now pergames the terrier Saudis Philadelphia and laodicea did you notice that he was there seven eight the last that when he came and water woke up those water sleeping versions because at the seven Church ages it is no longer a rib the bread is now complete she started as a Reaper to a plain woman everybody okay and then he says that bring them all way back down here in this through the years ages he has built a bride borneel bright begotten he's perfect he's bringing the holy ghost from the big pot amen proud on Earth for who Christ and the same way that he began this right he has begot what individuals collectively and individually everybody okay he said but he has been the Holy Spirit damage the water emphasis Church the female spirit part of it he was there holy spirit that birthday holy spirit that gives the water and the Italian churches in the dark it is the water holy spirit that built the water the bride the elect that is pulled out of all the organization system down through the edges like that there is an elect a predestinated blood of who Jesus Christ that's the Holy Spirit has gone out the elect it has been the holy spirit in this age in that age in that age that that what's up the oil the oil the oil the oil do by the feminine part of the old because the making not the groom they are making the bread everybody okay they're not making the head everybody okay the head will come later Lord help me brother barnab said during this time why see what happened it's the gentle blood is water selected in the seven churches and do what goes up this is why brother brother made this statement yeah in Revelation 13 ah Revelation 1 verse 13 the Bible says in the midst of the seventh candlesticks there was what one how like unto the son of man he was not the son of man [Music] he was one life scripture don't play with words when Jesus Christ came Jesus came as the son of man he said the son of man the son of man the son of man but when they punch him they punched the son of me amen but when that bread came out everybody here the Holy Spirit came out and entered into the church and begin to build the church the one they were building was not the son of man it was like he was not the son of man he was like to the son of man did I lost you watch brother Brown I'm interpreting this he said now that that is the Bible that is what the spirits say the Candlestick we went through the Candlestick all right and in the midst of the water seven golden water Candlestick the church ages there is one like the son of man what one like hey because he that Sanctified and they who gets Sanctified birth of Emma one foreign to present her to himself everybody okay that's why it is not the son of man but he is like the son of man like the son of man what one like him who was this his what right ministers suffer with this quote that's right yes they do amen he said one like him clothed with a garment down to the foot who does that in our churches the brother the brothers he said the Holiness of who Jesus Christ covering water her has washed us from our sins with his own blood God about the water [Applause] woman and if the church churches he's a woman which side of the Holy Spirit must enter the churches the male or the woman the female the female part of the Holy Ghost which is the part of the bread that will be responsible to make the blood of Jesus Christ so God is pouring the portion of the Bride into the woman so now the woman and the bride both of them are one he gets five sermon to guide you to this body everybody okay everybody okay let me see where I can uh land the world must deliver the bread the word bro church the church got to be delivered out of her they brought for who Christ them that fell asleep in all ages will make up their prayer that come out on out on the word and that and that that they come out on like from your feet coming to your head because God is building it he need a period of time gets greater and more you have to have and so forth the body grows up so that's the body of Christ do what grows up because they cannot give Jesus Christ a rib they cannot give Adam away God needed a period of time to build and then finally the water hey we'll do what come to it when the bra the bad is completed then what comes now the head that's why they had this called the Capstone is coming to cap the building [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] hey everybody okay this one is the bread but the blood is not a pyramid But the Groom is the head But the Groom himself is a pyramid he is always a pyramid he's always the pillar of Fire everybody okay so when he comes and connects to the bride the bride and the groom both of them make a pyramid and when they blend together this meter here disappeared [Applause] and this is what Paul said now it's the God who is all in all true inner everything now there is no more difference now the pyramid is one did I lost you mature food body amen and then finally the head will do what come to the head of its will if you notice because it is linked to the head the head that's the water turn it and the water pulling the big magnet that is everybody okay everybody okay let me find the landing place you want to stop here let me push a little then we stop so somebody can chew at home now amen we found out that this is the head and this one is the bride everybody okay this is the female part of God and this is the male part of God amen you cannot have marriage if the male doesn't come that's right did you get me did you get me you cannot have the marriage if the second oil doesn't come the first all will work you up but you will reach a certain point where the bridegroom then you need to use a second gift to pull you there because the ministry here must be so close to this exactly the same that they can blame and until they don't see any scar [Music] everybody okay maybe I need to stop here everybody okay everybody okay now when God pulled the bread out of Adam he pulled Eve Wednesday we found that he made the eve a byproduct you remember that and when the bride was punched out of Jesus Christ we came out from the side we are by product also by sex because Jesus came with a sex that's right all of us are born with sex Adam came originally but Eve came from the the flesh that was already worked with and then producing so just like there was a bright product of the first Adam there was also a byproduct of the second Adam because both two Brad came from the Sun are we okay are we okay because of the by-product he fell amen everybody okay what do you expect to come if the bride of Christ is brought forth out as a byproduct you want to go home I'm getting to a different material let me try to stop somewhere the birth of the church was that what Pentecost as the first Adam was given a bread how fresh from the hand of God and was how undefiled for a brief span three so was who Christ the last Adam giving a bride pure and fresh and what Pentacles and she remains separate and undefaultful sometimes everybody okay brother Branham say how long did this how long this continue we don't know but one day even as Eve was tempting and seduced by who Satan so the church was contaminated but the interest of an antichrist What Spirit remember the Beast that's why Paul say I see you as the serpent began you both got up from the side of Christ the serpent is coming back again everybody okay everybody okay brother Branham say and this he quotes the scripture is that other Spirit of antichrist whereof ye have heard that it should come and even now already it is in the world this is already the first stage the Antichrist amen he said and Jesus said concerning his bread in that first stage I'm going to skip for time the church was in that first stage already here Fallen woman I said them has gotten to eat before Adam even now had Satan seduced the church the Bride of who Christ before the marriage supper of the Lamb individually certain didn't win because individually we were baptized with the Holy Spirit but collectively something happened to the brother everybody okay man Lord help me the first son Adam was the spoken words the spoken seed word of who God he was given a bride to do what we produce himself that is why the bride was given to him to do what we produce himself to produce another Son of God but she did what Fair she fell by water she caused him to the water die the Second Son second Adam Jesus also a spoken seed word of God was given her right like us who was it Adam but before he could marry her she also done what Fallen they tapped us she like Adam 's wife was put to test whether she would believe the word of God and live or that the word and do what die she doubted and she left the word and she did what died you ready now yes from a little group of a true seed of the word God will present Christ a what beloved beloved water she is a virgin of his word she is a virgin because she knows what no man made creatures or water Dogma by and through the member of the Bride will be fulfilled all that was promise of God to be made manifested in the water version are you following me Adam giving a bride amen with a female part female spirit and a by-product flesh failed second Adam giving a female sad of the Holy Spirit by product by our birth through sex amen God have to do something because the marriage is not done yet what is God doing the purpose of your message everybody okay let me put something here predestinated there is the Water mystery he before Christ or anything else was ever on Earth you see his great mystery that he chose the water the bride knowing water evil fall from water disbelieving the word knowing that she would want for but he would choose a right that would work now fall so the end one is here amen he went and pick you up amen but Jesus Christ also when pilgrims enter and the serpent the dragon got into it the old serpent God never left the bread like that amen God started to rebuild through Luther justification he picked up one sanctification and began to worship and the Pentecostal that God must present himself abroad to prove to Lucifer that I will have a brother that you will never catch everybody okay everybody okay brother Bradham say knowing that he would choose a brand that will not fall that would hold to the world how regardless of what are the water the rest of the world has to say what about they will hold to that word they are predestinated to do what to stand there the adoption of the children by who Jesus Christ destinated the church to that great glorious what stands so somebody will not stare itself second blood cell so there is one because God is perfected in three let me see if I can land this trip amen you say brother Stephen they have the Holy Ghost yes but how did they fail remember Adam was a man he was Eve was a female she was in if that she missed watch this brother Branham say each one of those ages only taken a what whoa watch out yeah wow everybody okay they were coming from one ball are you following me are you following me I'm talking about the church collectively that's why Paul said I preach in they were only taking water they didn't have the full thing everybody okay you want to understand your message they were only taken water into the water justification is a work of water my brother you there can you give him another microphone you dare try it again praise God man is working praise God praise God okay I don't know what happened amen he said justification is a work of the water Holy Spirit sanctification is a work of work the Holy Spirit the baptism of the baptism means the work of what holy spirit that is the reason he took a prophetic perfect calm down no messenger today because the Holy Ghost came wow himself fullness baptism thank you are you following me are you following me they kind of stigma the fact remember this is just part amen there is missing the perfecting part as long as the perfecting part is not come this part here is not a pyramid it looks almost like a pyramid that's why Satan when he knocks this one out knock him down because the head is nothing that's why we need the head so that when Satan come again when he's tested he will hear what he heard in the wilderness when Jesus came out of the wilderness because when Jesus came out from the 40 days of passing Satan came and thought he was like Abraham because Abraham lied he thought he was like Joseph because Joseph lied he thought he was like Jacob but Jacob lied but he never met that anointing before because when that anointing was coming out he was a little man that was tired like this Satan look he said look at him he looked like a let me try to get him again when he tried him there are nothing responded it is written it is written it is written certain looking good he said who is loving that is the son of man it is the son of man this one is like the son of man we don't need like the son of man we meet the son of man himself foreign [Applause] [Applause] is this Benjamin he try again he goes this way he said let me try caliber he tried Caleb and say what is going on let me try sisters he tries to say that he said let me run away from this report because the bride and the groom both of them are one let's stop here let's head next time we will pick it up my friend if I continue here we're gonna get deeper again [Applause] Tommy's gone my friend everybody okay everybody okay the Redemption and the great mystery everybody okay I apologize I have to stop here if I try to get here we will get again deeper I know what is coming up everybody okay everybody okay that's why the son of man because the one in the churches is like the son of man that's why the devil has been playing [Music] finish he comes the nomination sit down the Wesley come up preach the Revival they therefore just waited denomination down the Pentecost will come speaking in tongue look at them today look at the Pentecostal churches today amen come down God preserve a prophetic message at the end for a purpose amen so that now it's not going to be like to the son of man but it's gonna be the son of man man amen let's stop here then we will pick up the son of man and see what does the son of man does everybody okay then you will understand the purpose of this message and why you need to esteem the message above everything because that is your protection that is the only thing that the pop is afraid the only religion that trouble the only people that do not want to submit
