[48:07] declared to be the Epistle of Christ
[48:10] ministered by US Written not with ink

[49:30] topic tonight by God's grace I'd like to
[49:31] talk about written Epistles written
[49:33] Epistles I want to kind of lay a little
[49:35] groundwork here just for a few minutes
[49:37] if you'll be patient with me and we see
[49:39] here that as apostle Paul was talking to
[49:42] this he was really when he starts in
[49:44] verse one he's he's asking him the
[49:46] question do I do I do I need your
[49:48] approval have I do you not know me you
[49:51] know remember they asked Jesus show us
[49:53] the father and they'll satisfy us and
[49:55] Jesus gave the answer have I been with
[49:57] you so long you don't know who I am
[49:58] that's right and see sometimes that's
[50:00] the way it is man wants approval of man
[50:02] but we must have the approval of God
[50:05] God's the one that approved us we've
[50:06] received a message that's been
[50:08] Vindicated by God that God has sent us a
[50:10] prophet to receive a message this is
[50:12] what Paul was he was the prophet to the

[50:58] out he's saying look I have received a
[51:00] message from God a message of God not to

[1:00:09] God as they see God in you that's
[1:00:12] it he said that's the only way that
[1:00:16] they'll know God is when we are written
[1:00:19] Epistles yes sir Epistles of the
[1:00:22] scripture amen this message did not
[1:00:25] change the Scripture it BR light on the
[1:00:30] Scripture it BR understanding of the
[1:00:34] scriptures God said he'd reveal nothing
[1:00:36] till he reveals it to his servants the
[1:00:38] prophets
[1:00:40] first that's God's order that's God's
[1:00:42] written order he cannot go against his
[1:00:46] written
[1:00:48] order it has to come through that
[1:00:52] manifestation glory be to God
[1:00:56] he said in the life that we live
[1:00:58] reflects what's on the inside of us
[1:01:00] that's ex Not only was it written that
[1:01:03] Moses would be used of God to be a
[1:01:05] deliverer but it was also written that
[1:01:07] Pharaoh would
[1:01:10] reject it's also written of the vessels
[1:01:12] of Dishonor as much as it is of the
[1:01:14] vessels of Honor right so this has been
[1:01:17] written of both there's only two
[1:01:21] here two
[1:01:23] spirits and they bring forth what
[1:01:25] they're written
[1:01:27] about oh
[1:01:30] Hallelujah glory be to God thank you
[1:01:33] Jesus what a message what a word we've
[1:01:36] received not just any word not just any
[1:01:39] word but a real word he said a man is
[1:01:41] identified by The Works that he
[1:01:47] does if you're not producing works you
[1:01:50] don't have no
[1:01:52] identification that's why a lot of
[1:01:53] people had their identity stole because
[1:01:55] they don't know what kind of work
[1:01:56] they're supposed to be
[1:01:57] [Applause]
[1:01:57] [Music]
[1:01:59] doing there's a lot of stolen identity
[1:02:01] that's why they don't know their because
[1:02:03] they don't know their written
[1:02:05] Epistles the Bible's not written of this
[1:02:08] not of this it's written of
[1:02:11] this is producing a life that's going to
[1:02:14] change this in the moment in the
[1:02:16] twinkling of an eye when the Trump of
[1:02:18] God shall sound and we shall be
[1:02:22] changed we shall give
[1:02:25] mortality to immortality corruptible
[1:02:28] shall take on
[1:02:30] incorruptible
[1:02:33] amen so our works should be
[1:02:39] good I thought we just done any way we
[1:02:42] want to if we was predestinated to see
[1:02:44] we just live any other way we wanted to
[1:02:46] do any no it ain't written like that
[1:02:48] don't rewrite the
[1:02:50] script be careful because he said if you
[1:02:52] add to it take away
[1:02:55] don't add to
[1:02:56] it don't take away just do what it
[1:03:01] says stay in
[1:03:02] [Music]
[1:03:03] prayer he said always good because we
[1:03:07] are representing our Lord Jesus
[1:03:10] Christ I think people would act better
[1:03:12] if they realize who he representing
[1:03:14] they're not just representing this
[1:03:16] church or brother Steven we're
[1:03:18] representing Jesus

[1:03:28] be right am
[1:03:30] amen glory be to God what a truth we've
[1:03:36] received he said the deity of Jesus
[1:03:40] Christ he said he made Moses a God to
[1:03:43] Pharaoh
[1:03:44] once what a strong words for a lot of
[1:03:46] people to understand God make a man God
[1:03:49] yeah he was his
[1:03:51] God you better believe he was his God
[1:03:53] yes sir
[1:03:55] he was a represent he was a written
[1:03:56] Epistle of God God WR that he was going
[1:04:00] to be the deliverer he I'm going to use
[1:04:01] Moses why you think he told him to take
[1:04:03] his shoes

[1:26:16] out of drama in this age that me and you
[1:26:19] are fulfilling out Peter said in First
[1:26:21] Peter 122 he said ye have see ye have

[1:26:32] the
[1:26:33] Brethren see that ye love one another
[1:26:37] with a pure heart
[1:26:39] F I believe that's what it's lacking
[1:26:42] around the message he's loving one
[1:26:44] another with a pure
[1:26:47] heart Bible said blessed are the pure in
[1:26:49] heart for they shall see God
[1:26:53] we're looking at the flesh too much

[1:26:57] word and the seed that lives in
[1:27:00] it hallelujah what a mighty God we
[1:27:04] serve listen what brother Brown said

[1:27:11] wrote right when when an actor's given a
[1:27:14] part he has to re he has to act out what
[1:27:17] is written of
[1:27:18] him he can't act out another part amen I

[1:27:29] out my part let's just get in our
[1:27:32] position and act out the part that God
[1:27:35] has given
[1:27:37] us in the deity of Jesus Christ brother
[1:27:40] talking about the drama he said I
[1:27:42] believe that we are facing yes sir he
[1:27:44] said are you
[1:27:45] listening he said to me congregation
[1:27:47] says amen he said all right we are
[1:27:51] facing now
[1:27:53] looking at the greatest drama that's
[1:27:56] ever been said in human history working
[1:27:59] out right here before us the great field
[1:28:02] of the world here and the drama that God
[1:28:04] is going to act out right now that it's
[1:28:08] starting to look
[1:28:11] around over the world and see how the
[1:28:15] thing is moving
[1:28:17] together oh how it's something fixing to
[1:28:20] happen friend he said this is what we've
[1:28:24] talked about and I said about it is
[1:28:27] right here now yes it's already starting
[1:28:34] everywhere breaking
[1:28:37] out this is the breaking out of the
[1:28:40] season it's the coming of the lord it's
[1:28:43] the bringing forth it's the third
[1:28:50] pull as I begin to look at this at
[1:28:54] this this drama do you know a
[1:28:57] drama forms a
[1:29:00] pyramid that don't happen just for any
[1:29:03] reason as I got to looking at that it it
[1:29:05] just I said my goodness no wonder
[1:29:08] brother St that's what is
[1:29:11] [Music]
[1:29:12] building coming to that Capstone of
[1:29:16] love there's five stages of it of this
[1:29:19] drama that we are fulfilling right
[1:29:22] that's being fulfilled right now brother
[1:29:23] Robert before mine and your eyes the
[1:29:26] first part of the drama is called the
[1:29:28] exposition the story starting
[1:29:33] point there had to be a prophet to start
[1:29:37] this
[1:29:38] thing there had to be a message to be
[1:29:41] preached that was the starting
[1:29:44] point it's the starting point is the
[1:29:46] setting of
[1:29:49] characters that's why I probably had to
[1:29:51] come and set every character and his
[1:29:53] possession to be placed as a son to
[1:29:57] receive
[1:29:59] adoption it's the extent of the story
[1:30:02] starts with the story's
[1:30:05] conflict God is
[1:30:08] safe
[1:30:09] Glory it ain't a flesh and blood
[1:30:13] Warfare
[1:30:16] Hallelujah the second part is the rising
[1:30:19] action it explores the is conflict up
[1:30:23] until the
[1:30:24] climax often things get worse because of
[1:30:28] wrong
[1:30:31] decisions that's what makes things worse
[1:30:34] be careful what decision you
[1:30:36] make you either decide to make a
[1:30:39] decision to follow Jesus or follow your
[1:30:46] emotions oh Hallelujah the third part of
[1:30:49] it is the climax every part of the drama
[1:30:53] is important but the climax is the
[1:30:57] landing spot or the turning point of the
[1:31:02] structure something had to turn us back
[1:31:05] to the faith of the
[1:31:08] father there had to be a message to
[1:31:11] bring a turning
[1:31:13] point come out from among them be not
[1:31:17] partakers of
[1:31:20] her
[1:31:23] to how can two walk together unless they
[1:31:26] agree can light and darkness have
[1:31:31] Fellowship the fourth part of it brother
[1:31:34] is the falling action is the aftermath
[1:31:36] of the climax it's the place where the
[1:31:41] director ties up the loose
[1:31:45] hands woo glory be to God we needed God
[1:31:49] to send us a prophet to tie up the loose
[1:31:53] end oh hallelujah what a message to time
[1:31:57] the loose to take us back to the
[1:31:59] unadulterated word of God back to the
[1:32:01] original
[1:32:05] faith and the fifth part is the
[1:32:08] resolution is how the story ends the
[1:32:12] final
[1:32:15] conclusion the enemy dies amen and the
[1:32:19] hero with the pride amen
