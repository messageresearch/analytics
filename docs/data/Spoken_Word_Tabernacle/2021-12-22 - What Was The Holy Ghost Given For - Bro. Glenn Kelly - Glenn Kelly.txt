are you our god alone from before time began as our brother comes here on your throne [Music] you are god alone [Music] you are god alone you are god that's just the way it let's give him is clap offering tonight amen amen in good times and bad time he's still god amen and he's not really alone you know that right there is somebody that was there do you remember that generation [Music] do you remember that mixing generation did anybody have a problem on that one because somebody told me just keep looking he said really and i went over again i say let's go one two three four five and uh wow i say yeah he was hitting under the seventh seal amen number 13 was hidden under the seventh seal his genealogy the genealogy of melchizedek is not among human beings and the genealogy of jesus christ because melchizedek became jesus christ is not a genealogy among human beings so what do you expect his wife genealogy to be not among human beings amen that's why they hid it and when on on revelation 5 when the seals when the lamb took the book automatically they opened that genealogy they say out of every kindred every tongue every nation and he has made us priest and king and peter say you are the chosen generation royal priesthood king and priest all of them together amen you are special in the eyes of god brother bradham say what gave jesus christ perfect faith is because jesus knew who he was amen so you gotta know who you are amen let this man be that was in who because we and him we are the same seed amen and brother branham say when you see this it will make the devil tremble amen when you see what when you see really who you are then in good time and bad time he's still god amen it doesn't matter what the devil can throw away it's nothing there is much much more to go with this priesthood just a lever is unfolding a lot of stuff like this by the time we get to the curtains of the tabernacle then it's something else amen boy this message is so good and so yummy and if you don't like it keep hanging around you will understand exactly what is in this message a seed shall serve him which is the woman who served the husband and that seed will be counted for a generation that makes it generation from abraham the father of our faith all the way to christ that perfect faith he gave signal with four gentile women one two three four telling you that it's a gentile gentleman tagenta then he hit mary mary shows you the perfect seed which is a multiplication by the spoken word not a pregnancy humanly speaking but by the spoken word that is the true ways that's the spiritual race the spiritual seed faith of abraham amen so you keep staying in prayer and then we're going to dig on that high priest a little bit and see what does the high priest really do beside us knowing him as a high priest what does it mean to us a high priest and you can see that there is nobody that will understand you like the high priest amen nobody amen they saw a short man on the tree and maybe somebody was passing and say what is he doing on the tree and nobody could decode what that man was doing on the tree only the high priest can decode that when he stop when he looked he's not looking at the man on the tree he's looking at something behind the man amen all we know is about that until brother branham comes and brother branham take us into zacchaeus home and brother branham entered in the house of zacchaeus and pulled the name of the wife of zacchaeus it's not even in the scripture he said her name was and so and this is the discussion they have in the morning because a prophet can go far away and get in your house and look and come back and begin to tell us what was going on so brother branham give you the back part of the story that is in between the land that will happen in the morning this is what happened in the house of zacchaeus so it's not just a man sitting on the i mean sitting on the tree it is more than that amen oh my god brother greg what can we do amen what can we do with this word amen blessed be the name of the lord we appreciate everybody of you everyone that came tonight i know it's a struggle with the highways and the christmas and everything with the traffic because of the christmas light which we do not celebrate i have to continue saying that so maybe somebody's struggling we do not celebrate christmas amen green or purple whatever if i if i dig now i had somebody calling me and begin to tell me about christmas i said did you watch the ceremony say no it just came in my heart to tell you how bad christmas is i study that look it's this it's this is this is i say you go back and listen to what i was preaching amen so all of that there's nothing to it we are the royal chosen generation that means more to us than anything amen good to see you back by the same and good to see everybody and sister sherrod it has been she was amen good to see you amen blessed be the name of the lord i am not the one preaching tonight brother kelly is preaching tonight amen he preached last sunday in south carolina and he came in the look at him like caleb amen still having that sword and ready to fight like give me the mountain amen so brother kelly will be ministering for us tonight and you keep praying for us for the oncoming service on new year's eve and we will have some good good time and i will be so happy to be sitting there and enjoying one by one and then even the secret one one by one that would be wonderful amen aren't you excited if you are not don't worry i will be excited i will be screaming amen amen and we will see some new faces some will be trembling some shaking we say praise the lord preach my brother amen don't worry about that as soon as the anointing hits you you're gonna forget everything that is going on here amen but we want to make sure you get into god's channel when it's earlier and you're going to save yourself a lot of headache and get there and before you know it the lord will lose you in a powerful way matter of fact we don't have any more time left it's almost gone the coming of the lord is really really really near amen thank you so let's go only believe um [Music] all [Music] we believe all things are [Music] hallelujah [Music] brother sam and brother polycarp my brother said that now it's not fair for me to have to come behind what came forth god hit that i'll tell but it's the same holy ghost right you can't look for no lobster and steak tonight we're gonna get you some top uh tilapia and uh we'll get you some rice tonight but it'll all be the holy ghost amen our hearts and mind the clear amen let us bounce lord god we thank you for your grace your mercy lord god we thank you lord jesus for just giving us the opportunity lord god to come here to be in thy presence of this oppression chosen precious generation lord god so we give you praise we give you honor we give you glory lord jesus and father those that are alive streaming strengthen them lord god bless them brother john and the other ones and david and the saints lord god that's looking in far in our floor god let them not be disappointed because they come to hear from you lord jesus so father we come now thanking you for receiving the songs of zion tonight lord god we know that you and your children are encouraged now we need you lord god just to come lord god anoint the word tonight father you can unfold us through your precious bride lord god and father we bring every spirit under subjection tonight father get glory to thy name and get glory to thy kingdom we thank you in jesus name we pray amen and amen okay and while you're standing you can turn to um um we could turn the psalms 16. and it's just a little thought by the grace of god that we was been on our heart and um nothing new we just want god to anoint it for worse and um be a blessing yes say psalm 16 and let's look at verse 8 and 9. once you have it you say amen it says i have set the lord always before me because he is at my right hand and i shall not be moved hallelujah it says therefore my heart is glad and my glory rejoice my fresh and my flesh also shall rest in hope in john chapter 14 and then you may be seated and once you have it say amen but look at verse 12. john the gospel of john verse 14 verse 12 says verily verily i say unto you he that believeth on me the works that i do shall he do also and greater works than these shall he do see this is perfect for what the lord showed you sunday so you know he's expecting something greater out of this generation is that right much is given much is required is that right hallelujah he said the works that these shall be that you should these shall he do because i go unto my father may the lord add a blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated no we just look in that little thought we got the thought from um the inspiration was um what was the holy ghost given for what was the holy ghost given for just a little simple thought here tonight we want you to you know things have really been pressing on me we can see by the signs by the prophecies time is near and you know we we you want to be sure that you have the goods you know because this is not an hour to be you playing with a devil that he has an organized army and he come to take us out but we know because he come to kill steal and destroy is that right he's the author of confusion but god has told us greater is he that is in thee than he that's in the world he says no weapons formed against us you're prosperous so we're now recognizing that you know the generation i'll tell you that's really special that just opened things up that should take you to a rapturing faith of grace just to re-ready the rapture of up about here god hid that there for years right there you know we've always lining all of them up in that generation is that right well when god showed us that he didn't start with adam who did he start with he started with david and abraham is that right so i tell you those three types with those 14 in there and that 13 hidden in there boy i tell you my my my mind we have a total now you know you're of the royal priesthood you know you have roar your blood you notice it's not believing you know it so it should not be no wavering now things we got to be sure that you got that baptism of the holy ghost that right because we're about to get out of here and that's the only thing that's going in the rapture is the message of the hour for your day is that right we're going in so i don't want to by the grace of god let me read this here you know when the holy ghost you know actually you know we're looking at so much and just kill we're actually you're going back but you're going but we're moving forward you know when that labor was opened up you you shrimp was able to see calvary in it is that right it bring you right there all the way to to that blood and you know but we know in calvary that god had came when he defeated the devil there at calvary right all sin was defeated at calvary and so we know that right there when the lord said it is finished it's finished but he also has given us the right down to authority to bind and loose is that right there's no way when the holy ghost come you move forward the joy of the lord is our strength and no matter what satan can throw with you now it cannot bind your thought it cannot take your joy because we are fighting a defeated enemy is that right he's defeated he's the bluff he's a good adversary but as long as we're walking out after the flesh but stay in the spirit is that right and that's why the holy spirit showed us even those that getting thrown off in this message right now he done taught us he said some is looking at the prophet of god as just in the flesh is that right and so if god had told us where we walk in the spirit is that right and then when you walk in the revelation of the word the light of the word uh god will open up and show you war is that right so then he also told us we can walk in the rim of visions is that right so we can move in there so now you know by you being a chosen generation all these things are yours you don't have to worry about it you can look for it is that right we're walking in this hour here by faith now you see why the holy ghost kept anointing the past about walking with boldness i could come to boldness before the throne of god is that right you can go to boldness through the throne of god for your family for your loved ones something that's someone that's suffering you claim him is that right don't give up on anyone you'll find out because the true seed of abraham they fully believe that all things are possible is that right but the prophet of god we're only not saying i heard him say brother branham saying the message not so much as all things are possible but do you believe the words that you say can come to pass if you say to this mountain it shall be moved huh i don't want to get ahead of myself we're talking about all what he did for calvary then he came in he sent what he send us the holy ghost is that right when he send us that holy ghost he come with the lead and guide us into all truth it's the spirit of god it's the what is the melchizedek is that right ah god has given us another anointing in this hour here now he's opening that word up is that right now you got a revelation of who melchizedek really is is that right he had to come the holy spirit told us that jesus christ he had to switch place with jesus christ is that right he had to switch place because he had to come and get in the body he created his flesh he created a sail is that right that seeds sail inside of mary and he had to get in there to do what to perform to finish the work is that right to finish the work he had to fulfill isaiah 9 and 6. is that right he had to come and that seed had to be burned in there and what was he called a child shall be grown a son shall be given he shall be called what the counselor you young children you got the best counselor in the world i you got the holy ghost living inside of you he'll talk to you he'll walk with you he'll sleep with you he'll keep you huh we are not sent to live a defeated life we are more than conquerors you are all retrievers in this generation hallelujah it's true look what we say now we're at what what was the holy ghost sent forth when we're coming in it's out we're here now the holy ghost had a purpose when the holy ghost is there's many things we won't get to all of it tonight i don't want him to say like i did before coming in and said i try to preach a two-hour message in the hour the humble brother saying but all is well he says now he says let's look and see what this holy ghost is sent for and then when you see what this holy ghost is sent for now since god have nailed it i mean open up the words and show you who you really are is that right some have the holy ghost and they don't realize it and some need the holy ghost you see so we are the rig because god's not going to lose not a one said brother kelly we know these things that's okay i'm a preacher anyway because god gave me grace to bring it here tonight because you still have individuals struggling is that right you got people out there struggling and when they're around they're struggling we don't want none of our because god said that he wasn't going to lose neither one of them and it's our hair now so they have to first go back and get a revelation of calvary is that right what the blood has jesus christ has done for you is that right but if you go into acts 10 to tell you it was the blood of god is that right it was god that came down in here he could not send anyone out to you not any other angel god had to come himself is that right he had to come and get his bride when he had to come and get his bride first we were justified he's like what you never did it now you see in your origin why you never did it now you see why brother brahma said you never did it because the revelation of with the blood from the foundation of the world you were in the mind of god you were not part of the other lineage your origin was in the mind of god uh you were the supernatural being that had to come forth and he saved the best for what laodia is that right what was the holy ghost for we had to understand saints you got this you you're battling this battle but you have the victory god doesn't warn us we're going to have to fight for every inch of it and the brother said every inch of it is that right god is doing so much he's getting his music organized okay stay strong brother john that's not about the devil coming at you stay strong brother because god put this together he's the one that started the good work and he's the one that's going to finish it is that right it's not by power it's not by might but it's by the laws is that right says that right huh the spirit of god is coming in he's in this place and he's in you because you brought him with you hallelujah the holy ghost he was sent what he said one he was sent forth one to be with god he wanted us now when he come god and god as he wanted to be with adam he always fellowship with him in the cool of the night is that right so when he cool with fellowship with him in the cool of the night god always wanted what fellowship is that right when he got over there in the sin see when they got in there and they just looked at the natural part of it he said whoa when god looked around he said i had no one to do what tilt the ground is that right but we know the problem of god brother branham told us it was a compound meaning is that right physically tilting it but spiritually he loved what worship is that right i needed someone to worship me that's why he got around he had no one yet but he had to bring a plan of what a redemption it had to be filled we had to move into the adoption part but god always wanted us to be one that's why we're one with him that what jesus prayed in the in the lord's prayer john 17 is that right that was the that was the lord's prayer over in matthew 9 that was your disciples prayer when jesus prayed and that the father that they be one as we are one the one with what one with the word you'll be coming now one back again with the word in the beginning was the word the word was god the word was with god and the word was made flesh is that right you rather hallelujah lord this is a glorious time hallelujah my god my god thank you jesus thank you lord thank you jesus and look and see what he said now he always wanted that one he always wanted that fellowship adam wasn't looking for god he should have been but when he got deceived there i mean when he willfully sinned there in that garden what he should do god came looking for adam is that right because he always wanted that fellowship when we was here in our routy lives and what god had us hidden in in that world is that right he had us in whatever that walked of life that we was in but if god god came looking for his child he came out looking for him he know that you were out there why because he you were in his mind before the foundation of the world saints god wanted us to be one with the word that's why he had to do what restored he said i shall restore what the power worm the cankerworm the caterpillar the locust have eaten up that religious demon he had people bound up with that religious spirit that's a rough demon out there now is that right we're going to walk let us take our time because i want you to see this by the grace of god in this hour here now it's always been it's always been a religious battle is that right then that brother branham said that cain was a believer huh he said cain was a believer he was trying to show us that what and that it was all by election it was by election he chose us before the foundation of the world so you give him praise you give him mind he gets all the glory because god foresaw all this from the beginning up until the end this is all our saints we've been waiting for the opening of the word uh you see what i'm saying he's taking a lot of darts this fellowship is taking a lot of darts the pastor's taking a lot of darts you don't really know what's going on in the spiritual realm that's why he said we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principality and powers and wickedness and rulers in high places but god has given us the victory he said you want to whip him he wanted to be able to withstand the love of the animal he said i said put on the whole arm of god and when you will be able to withstand why all the while all the trickery and what is it now the whole world is only being revealed to his bride anointed by the holy ghost help me lord he said look he said he wanted what he wanted fellowship the holy ghost wanted fellowship he always did had that fellowship he loved to have fellowship with his children that's why when brother branham said he had confidence in job the reason why you have confidence in job is because he had fellowship with joe [Music] see you got fellowship with god you know you know what you're troubling with you know the things that you're troubling witness hour here now he says how can you get to know someone if you don't have fellowship with them is that right we're family is that right we're family we coming out there i'm gonna hit you a little bit is that right huh say you got the holy ghost and the holy ghost lean guide you i thought i heard the pastor say if you if we had some kind of gathering whatever they send to me they send it out to all those are texts is that right i'm getting ready to pinch you now he said you know even if you're not going to come he said do what send a text back and respond to the text is that right because a reservation has to be made if you go into a wedding if you go into some island and you get an invitation you have to send an rsvp is that right because why because they're planning for you to be there they're not if you come there and if you don't you haven't made plans and then you may not be able to have a plate or get something to eat hallelujah anyhow i don't know where that comes from but it's there huh we're a family huh when you come we truly truly love everyone that right god god corrects us is that right hallelujah he come to do what he come to finish the work he come to finish the work of redemption now the holy ghost said he came in here he had to finish that work and to finish that work is through who it's through you and i is that right let's go to john 14. and we'll read a few scriptures hallelujah he said now look he said let not your heart be what did he believe in god he believed also in me is that right huh he said in my father's house or many what manson and if they were not so i would have told you i go to do what the place for you i thought i heard the holy ghost say they're trying to talk about the birth of jesus christ i thought i heard him say a couple sundays ago and that he spoke more of the death than the bearing and resurrection then then the birth is that right huh so we had to understand let me keep going he said look he said i'll go away and prepare a place for you he says if i go and prepare a place for you i would do what come again and receive you unto myself that where i am there you may be with also that's a rapturing scripture that's not the baptist scripture that's our scripture that's why they always holler god is good all the time god is good all the time yeah you bring a correction to ride a correction to them and see how good god's just thrown in they're running pastor out of there huh hallelujah don't let them steal your scripture don't let them steal your scripture that's our scripture god promised he promised he's going away to prepare a place for us is that right but it's going to come again that's why the holy ghost said he had to come and send the resurrection had to come and send the holy ghost he told us the other week that what that's why he didn't call everybody from that grave is that right hallelujah because the chosen generation has got to wait until the end time is that right hallelujah if you bring them up from the other ages help me lord help me lord finish the work their redemption he said now look and whether i go you know and the way you know he says drop down to verse seven he said now look i mean verse he says and whatsoever ye what ask in my name that will i do that the father may be glorified we're at in the son if your mother then objective is to glorify the lord to glorify him whatever you ask in his name you can receive is that right it's your saints you're living below your standards if you believe what you asked do what prepared get prepared is that right then brother brenda preacher message preparation and he was talking about them preparation people can talk about this rapture people know a rapture is coming he talked about the intellectual demon in the end time and they saying these things but we have to understand if you really want to know if they got a revelation of what god is saying they will what prepare is that right we are preparing god is bringing every word that he promised to us is that right he promised the latter rain we're getting it is that right we can't get it without it it has to be the form in the ladder it has to come together the teaching reign has to come is that right it establishes you it puts you in your position that's why he said go ye all the world and do what preach and teach the gospel hallelujah where did jesus come you're going to see why i looked in that scripture when he got over there brother steve you're thinking we don't want to have a prayer line yes we want to have a prayer if that's where god's grace and mercy is but that's not what god is calling for in this hour you have to be careful because the sum in the message knows how to work it listen to what i'm saying they know how to work it that's under the permissive will of god that was for the jews they the one that believed on the laying in hand you gotta ask them show me where they cast out devils but by their what words huh the jews they had to lay hands on not a not a gentile i don't want to get ahead of myself you got to catch what he wanted to do it's the spoken word it's the original seat see they don't want to move them up there the only way you're going to get there you got to be preached up there he sent a five-fold ministry to bring you up there is that right you got to understand who you are you are the sons and daughters of the most high god you come from royal blood uh here now i tell you when george bush was president and his daughters got their self in little jam you know what they said brother steve when the policemen stopped them they looked around and said my daddy is george bush you know what ah devil you trespassing i got the holy ghost my daddy is god i come from the origin of god i'm from the royal blood you can say your name by revelation devil in trouble devil in trouble oh he won't be able to touch this generation huh shout right me shaq and i've been the girl [Laughter] what did he say look at here he says if he ask anything in my name i will do it if you love me keep my commandments see you gotta run in according to the rules of god you'll get what you're supposed to deserve but it's got to be according to god's way when nobody is not going to change it he didn't change it for himself is that right god did not change the word for himself he's not going to change it for you he's not going to change it for me isn't that right but we coming boldly to the throne of god oh saints when you go there that's why when the pastor holy ghost knowing that the pastor brother stephanie said to walk around humble and like that stop acting like your that old religious devil getting on you huh you stand up to that devil sometimes you just you got to stand boldly you understand and one of the things was power and prayer one of the was power and prayer the holy ghost brought when you're down there praying you don't go to their begging you don't go to the god whining you go that way whether you go to him what as a son is that right and a daughter for the most high god what you ask you can't receive you got the word if it's according to the will of god he said they asked they ask a miss is that right they ask a miss because their motive and their projective is not right and they're not believing what they're asking for anyway is that right come on now that's why he asked him have ye received the what the holy ghost since he believed this holy ghost is essential brother branham when he ran that series he said this is some food for the soul he realized that deep down inside some didn't have the holy ghost some need that holy ghost and some have it and don't recognize that they have it so we have to understand every last time we was here we was telling you guys you possess the gates of the enemy after your test after your trial when he got around and then you have to understand that's why when god brought jesus on the scene now his 30 years he had a ministry is that right and he was tested for 30 but those last three years was hard trials and tests is that right so we have to understand that what this holy ghost noun is sent to do after jesus christ had went to calvary and he died there on calvin rose again is that right send back the holy spirit to anoint his word in the end time to finish the redemptive plan of god [Music] he said look what he said hallelujah verse 15 if ye love me keep my commandments and i will pray the father and he shall give you another comforter that he may abide with you for what now we're talking about how did he go all he did was pray he said i pray i i heard brother uh to sean in his last wednesday and he was talking about what the holy ghost he was talking about christ and he was talking about prayer remember they was in there praying when peter there he was in jail and when he was there in jail they was there praying all night they just took john's head off is that right and when they got around there so they was after peter um next but the saints was in prayer all night is that right signing and crying but they were going through the throne boldly is that right they didn't have to they they didn't have to back up now you don't have to back up off of any devils one of your weapons that the holy ghost gave you was the power of prayer and when you get around it whatever you bind on earth shall be buying in heaven whatever you loose on earth shall be loose in heaven but we're gonna have to show you but what is greater than that times you won't have to you don't have time near the prayer but he showed you the spoken word can perform in the same worker if you don't have that time to pray we're moving into the spoken word saints bear with me you want to see i mean the word that's what shakes the devil is that right when the devil came at jesus christ there when he was tempted and he was tested and he was trying to get him to use his power his authority for himself but he turned around and then and he said he said to me he says if you be the king of god trust you've turned his breath to stone okay over there matthew 4. he's telling him he said now you let me see you turn these breads to stone jesus said what man should not live by what bread alone but by everyone words that proceedeth out of what ah the mouth the tongue is that right the holy spirit doesn't brought that to you you're moving to another level you're moving into the spoken word but you can't handle the spoken word without the character and without wisdom is that right that's why when you give you got to have the wisdom remember brother branham was in that prayer line and he was there to stay there for i think was an hour and 15 minutes he was praying for a baby and he was praying for that baby and he got around there she pauled and they had zeal but the wisdom of god got got to grow on you that's why you hear the pastor say and that the message isn't in the 40s he's got messages in the 50s he got messages in the 60s he got limited messages they he progressively moved into that ministry in the leadership of the holy ghost is that right so that's why he was saying when questions and answers of what what is the holy ghost on the question and answers i'm trying to slow down for you brother he got over there what he was telling him that his ministry he said first he wasn't he says the uh praying for the sick then he came and he said the discernment is that right he said but what i've always been trying to get you to is the spoken word he said that's what their ministry was bringing us to and you are in the age that reap all the benefits hallelujah so that's why it takes wisdom and he was saying when he was praying for that baby in that hour and 15 minutes but then remember he went back to the scriptures and started and made an example of the prophet that was under the wrong spirit when those children called him bald head this is the way we're saying wisdom only comes from god we come not the wisdom of man so he had the gift but he had to grow into it and what he was showing and remember when he told moses when his father-in-law jethro told moses moses you need some help you're going to wear yourself out and the people too so when brother branham spoke that what he was referring to actually he made all those people wait for an hour and 15 minutes and he said sometimes god is leaving things on people he said don't be quick to take it what he was showing you wisdom only comes from god that's where you have to move into certain things so that's why we're showing you things now god has given us what the wisdom of god the mind of god all the wisdom that we need is in jesus christ and then look help us lord he said now with that comforter he says even the spirit of what truth who in the world cannot receive because it seeth him not neither knoweth him let me show you come to me again before i turn to luke god help me 11. let me show you where this god help me with this spoken word hallelujah looking for the scripture where where he cast out uh the demons and he came back hallelujah help me lord that was luke 11. let me see if i wrote it down lord help me yeah i want you to see this because some field that don't truly see where the lord is moving us into but remember he says that that they had he was clean his body was swept clean and when he was swept clean and then he he went about the devil went about the i think it was luke nine was it nine 11 24 11 24. there it is thank you brother hallelujah luke 11 24. we want you to look at this here and i don't have the quote in front of me but when i was reading and looking at look what brother branham said what happened here he said in this scripture here that's what sealed it in my heart about he wants the spoken word he wanted he said here he said when the when the unclean spirit is going out of the is going what he do what was he cast out brother branham said he laughed he left because you received the word once you receive the word and it's mixed with faith you see the only way the devil can enter back in is doubt there's no other way he can come in so he didn't go about that's why when you hear the pastor saying they're going to be pentecostal some of you laughed but he's trying to move you to another level i'll come at y'all in the name of jesus christ jesus never did that you see and so in pentecost they think that some they're still doing it in this message you see where god is moving us to look what he said he said now he never cast them out he said when the unclean spirit is going out of a man he walketh through dry places seeking what rest he's looking for rest and we're supposed to have the rest ah because the holy ghost is the power that's right brother abel the holy ghost is the power the holy ghost is what god sent done he leads you to guide you your fortress your buckler your protector you are sealed grieve not the holy spirit of god which is why you are sealed unto the day of your redemption hallelujah i'm going to get through some quotes in a minute just bear with me i want you look look what he says he says and when he coming he finally swept and garnished he says then go with he and and take him to him seven other spirits more wicked than what himself so now you're dealing with eight demons you can go over to deuteronomy and seven and look at and and look at them cain tonight paradise hives jebusites seven demons greater that's right seven nations they're spiritual now they're demons we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities and powers and wickedness and rulers in high places these are demon forces that's why when the pastor came up suddenly when i was looking at the service he was there saying i can't i hate the devil i got no use for the devil he has right to we got a lot of blood on our hands and if satan trespasses i have no problem unless the lord i need a word you said when the enemy come in like a flood you will lift up a mighty standard against it huh greater is he indeed than he that is in the world no weapons formed against me shall prosper is that right because god has given us the words god in his hour here now what did he swore by he swerved by nothing greater than himself which is the word of god speak the word and stand on it he's giving you the authority what you buying on earth should be buying on heaven who sends you remitted see that was one of the benefits that god gave you also when you receive the holy ghost you can grant someone eternal life that's a powerful statement there's no other age that they have that that's why peter and john said in the gates called beautiful he said silver and gold have i none give it he said look upon me i give you such as i have he said what if you can have faith in the name of the lord jesus christ rise up and give up and welcome and they could not touch him is that right when peter came when the holy ghost came peter had the power what speak is that right speech let's go over to acts 2 saints hallelujah we're talking about coming to another level you know you got to understand it has to be a test i was telling them there's sunday when we got over there and played a little football there used at a junior high junior high school level and you get over there you know when you at a junior high school level they got around and so then they went to the high school level and they got down there on the high school level um brother benjamin and they got down there you know and the guy line right up in front on brother steve and they got over there he said boom boom and when i got up my head was going just going like this like welcome to high school buddy now you got to understand what god is doing here now now you got to realize what that you're wrestling against 200 million demons that's loose out there right now this is not this is no play play but god has given us the word to take us to rise above is that right because god prepared a place for us we see you know that you have the holy ghost you're getting prepared is that right just shows that your preparation is there you've been justified you've been sanctified you're filling with the holy ghost now you're moving it to the adoption is that right when we move until now the adoption god is just training you he's seen that you worthy he's getting us worthy is that right getting us ready for the resurrection getting us ready for this this one time show that that's going to happen saints oh boy i'm excited look what he said now we know here in acts 2. and peter we're going to just paraphrase it we're going to read not all of it but over in acts 2 peter being the spokes remember when peter was over there in the book of luke when jesus to be praying for him and jesus told peter that he was going to deny him three times is that right when he got over there peter yet he had the affiliated love but he did not have the agape love yet no one can call him the christ only by the holy ghost and that's the affiliated love you've got to have that seed down inside you being worried by the spirit that's why he said put on the whole armor of god the letter killeth but the spirit gave his life is that right so we have to understand now god has done bringing us to work help us lord he said look now peter knew god did not tell them to go in the upper room he told him to go there galileo wait is that right brother branham said what they was afraid he said they was afraid because the jews would have killed them and i'm telling you you don't have to worry about the drunkard the drug addict or those prostitutes homosexual lesbian robbers stealing the one you got to watch out for is demo religious demons they were the worst demons out that's right brother seth and the worst demons out there they would let kill you believe they doing god or servants is that right because they what this age they blind miserable wretched naked and rich of good and got their religion is that right saying that they got god but denying the power thereof denying the holy ghost who are we saying religious demons i like them demons all the time when they're in in in the prisons and in the jails as soon as you leave out of there you're telling them about acts 2 38 repent be baptized in the name of jesus christ for remission of your sins you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost and then you become religious demon come right behind you and tell them about matthew 28 18 19 is that right now you got to fight that demon when you come back first that's why he said you got to first get a man what born again is that right he said peter now remember peter when he was over in book of luck when jesus said he had to pray for him is that right he said peter the devil desires to sift you like weak but i what pray for you he said but peter but though once you are what converted be boring again once you convert it then you can go and help your brother your brother or your sister that's why brother branham said they're running out there with the missionaries they're doing that missionary work and ain't even got the holy ghost yet is that right hallelujah let's get the holy ghost first then let's get the missionary work done out there is that right hallelujah have your way lord peter he got there now he was among those jews in that upper room when they got there they had to go and they had to wait until they was endured with what power from up on high they had to get there and tarry look at the grace that's being extended to us we don't have to tarry he said they received the holy ghost umbrella robert the holy ghost fell on them as he spake these words the spoken word is bringing into action again it's going to be a book of acts again it has to bring forth another branch and you're a part of it saying boldly for the name of the lord jesus christ thank you lord he came in his hour here now knew that if they couldn't come down out of that upper room huh without that holy ghost they know they could that's right brother steve they couldn't leave out there without that holy ghost them jews would have killed them he said brother brandon they talk about the pandemic talk about the mask talk about these plagues running around here huh we the message of you know what brother brandon said the biggest plague is he said exactly what he said fear running among the bride huh don't come with me with no doubt don't come with me with that fear huh huh with joshua what caleb tells joshua i'm 80 years old when joshua put that sword in my hand he said i want my mountain i feel just as strong as i was 45 as i'm 80 years old now give me my mountain give me my promises don't come around me with no doubt huh why you want to doubt this ain't my home anyway huh if you take me out i'm getting close to the home satan is just a tool to get us out of here that's all oh death where's dice thing oh grave where's thy victory glory be to god he did not give me the spirit of fear he gave me the spirit of love peace joy and a sound [Music] peter and them knew they couldn't come down there without the holy ghost they knew it they knew his dollar here now that's what he said the baptism of the holy ghost and then he doesn't know why he sent it he sent it so we could finish fulfilling the plan of redemption the work of god says look over here in acts chapter 2 peter crane see they all got to be on one mind one accord we all got to be on one mind one accord don't let that spirit come up in here the devil tried to take away you know your benefits just about every place i go they it's a famine of hearing the words huh they can sit there and watch a movie for two hours they can go around in and we talk about a ball game for two hours and and being good uh i'm caught up in the things in it of that world and then but think jesus says setting out your treasures on things on earth and put your treasure on things above above things that are what eternal that's what happened to the one when jesus was looking at the young rich ruler is that right he looked at that young rich ruler and jesus knowing everything and the young rich ruler recognized the character jesus had a life that he didn't have all he had was what was religion he hid behind religion for a long time but then the one here we come the word be able to discern the thoughts and intents of the heart looked at him and told him what okay master he said good master he said why you call me my star he only saw jesus as a teacher he did not see jesus as being god in the flesh why do you call me master he says only one good master that's god and he came around there he said what must i do to inherit eternal life he said what must i do he said sell all your good give your riches give it to the poor is that right it was another thing he told me had to do too right pick up the cross and follow me he could not why he said where your treasures are that's where your heart is he turned around and looked at him and said what now when you look at yourself you're self-examining time is that right his heart was not totally sold out to the will of god he wanted he was selfish he had a selfish spirit that's what i'm trying to drive these demon forces out here how many of you even pick up the phone and call the head deacon and ask them what needs to be done around the church or call a trustee and ask him what needs to be done around the thank church lord that wasn't in the notes lord thank you you see what i'm saying every whatever we do and word indeed do it in the what name of the lord is that right hallelujah the footsteps of the righteous he's ordered of the lord yeah you gotta you gotta hit him you gotta get out the way and let him have his way he ambushed somebody he ambushed somebody i'ma tell you tell you about tell you tell your boss you ain't coming to work don't call in on your job even if you're staying home oh he ain't pushing you now ain't he yeah i'm not going to stop have you wait lord you see see one thing i learned a long time ago see when i go into jails in the prisons then i i preach a little harder than this and if they even put a dagger or something in me by now and i say thank you jesus you know what i'm doing why because one thing they recognize sitting in there they recognize two things they recognize the devil and they recognize if you love them or not that's the key you see so when they know these things when you come because you love them because when you go in there is no money there's no popularity there's no glory you always dump and that's why i thank you humbly when you pray for me when you pray for me when you're out there god is doing some great things we went down there i've been going the last three weeks down to the jail and it went down in there they got a new program they call rest re-entry the service support support services and then that service down there we went down there the first time when i went you go and you got a little package a care package for the inmates and when you go around and you give an opportunity to talk to them about the lord and tell them if they got the lord they don't have the lord and then you know give them some directions so we turned around when the first time we went down there you know it was the chaplain got down then was talking with her and talking there with the chaplain in real life started pouring her heart out and and she testified said i believe your first day here god sent you for me i'm telling you the lord is good the footsteps of the righteousness is ordered on the lord and before we left it brother steve she said pray for me now that's what i'm telling you what god is doing he's doing some great things wherever that seed is we're not going to lose not a one you got to realize what god sent this holy ghost for that's why he's sending his love when we're telling you about this this is a faith that's working by love is that right so we have to continue to move forward don't let the enemy rush try to rush the pastor up here in the blue pit he's trying to cut you on your blessings share it with me you got to realize this take your notes and take your notes do i catch everything that comes from everything no i got to go back home and do a little digging myself is that right he understands that but god is extending it giving him grace it's not this is not just being a blessing just here he's going far and wide trust me saints when we get on the other side you're going to recognize you have front row seats so what god is doing hallelujah peter look what he said now we're talking about the power of speech when the holy ghost come when the holy ghost come and give you power of speech that brother's saying look at verse 14 when they come in there look what pete how peter responded acts 2 14 but peter standing up with the eleven lifted up his voice and said unto them ye men of judea and all ye that dwell like jerusalem be this known unto you and hear and hearken to my what he knew where he was then ah he came down out of that upper room he knew what he was who he was then he knew why he was here he knew where he come from he knew where he was going huh he knew it saints he was that spokesman for the group that boldness with him peter ignorant couldn't even read or write his name but they recognized he had been with jesus hallelujah he had been anointed by the holy ghost and he had been called by god he had been anointed by god have been appointed by god doing the work of god by the spoken word for his day did not cast that devil out that devil was not cast out that's why the pastor holy ghost kept having the pastor say that making people think then they're falling on out falling out there on the ground and still walking around in there just like they did when they sacrificed when when they sacrificed in the in the old testament it was to cover their blood you know i mean cover their sins for for a year it's like they're making the people think they got the holy ghost because they can stay speaking in tongues this holy ghost you know just no speaking in tongues that's the least of the gifts it's a manifestation of of the holy ghost when this holy ghost is powerful this holy ghost is able to save your soul stop your lying stop your drugging stop your drinking stop your smoking stop your gambling stop your fooling around stop your stealing stop your disobedience this is power in the name of jesus christ the devil trembles when you hear that name we back down off of no devil no devil saints huh we come to set the captive free what do you say brother robert the spirit of the lord is upon me he has anointed me to preach the gospel open the eyes of the blind cast out devils heal the sick raise the dead deliver them from cancer deliver them from leprosy deliver him in the name of the lord rise up give him his glory i just satan we chose to stick with the despised few as moses he chose not for the riches of egypt huh but he's chosen to stick with the children of god you want to take reproach she's saying she got to realize this one thing the lord showed brother steve a long time ago the name of jesus walking with jesus is not popular jesus was not popular huh he came in there tearing down the kingdom of satan it's no glory that's why when brother branham said what he said young man you get out there you need to take your wife with you huh need to keep you is that right don't be handling that money don't let no no pride get on you huh it can happen that's why you left that thorn raided in paul's side hey get around you got to make sure you're hearing the holy ghost i'm getting ready to pitch some of y'all i'm getting ready to pinch some of y'all but the stephen said brother stephen said brother stephen said i said whoa wait a minute i'll go home and start praying i'm not claiming to be no more holy but a blind man know a righteous man faith come by what here in the what [Music] the holy ghost through your scriptures is the only way you're going to be able to discern it you make sure that's why you hear me say the holy ghost even if i don't understand it i believe it the holy ghost because what he preaches he backs it with the scriptures he says nothing is god saying that when they tried to lift jesus up did not he run oh yeah i know i'm hitting some demons in here because god doesn't ambush them i can feel it let me tell you something got to hold me accountable for if he speak he told me to speak it and i don't speak it because it come to set somebody free that's what he come to do you see because the gift is there i was telling a young fellow he got over there and he played professional baseball my wife and i was giving them a ride to the airport and i said oh you so you hit who are you at what league you're in such triple oh you didn't make it to the pros yet huh now they want you to get up there hit home runs i said they do i said where can you hit from both sides of the place he said no he says uh now i'm past that i said we told you that i said one thing you have to remember young man the gift is in you they cannot teach you to hit a baseball they can teach you what you're not doing why you're not hitting that baseball but the gift is already in you now we got the gift and the giver the gift the gift was put in him before the foundation of the world so you have to become spiritual minded quit thinking you like men you got to catch the holy ghost you got to catch what he's doing in his hour here now you see we walk not after the flesh but after the spirit he told him now that's why he was he when you go in and uh uh uh go over the first uh corinthians hold your hand there help me lord go to first corinthians chapter 2. see if we come back to that yeah i know some of you got quiet that's okay i still love you you you got to understand what's going on you see because first communion first corinthians look at two and we'll start at um just say good um go back to 30 first corinthians 1 and 30. but of him are ye in christ jesus who of god is made unto us what and what and what and what redemption that according as it is written he that glorified let him glory in the what he says and i brethren when i came to you came not with excellence of what speech or what wisdom declaring unto you the testimony of who of god for i determine not to know anything among you say what jesus christ and him crucified he said and i was with you in the weakness and in fear and in much trembling and my speech and my preaching was not with what see i don't come here to play with the devil i got no use for the devil you come here for the word of god the holy ghost corrects us all that's why you hear the pastor say he's the boss he's being honest he's an honest man you have to try him see you got to recognize why you're here you've been called for the glory of god in the name of the lord jesus christ he's teaching you this is a what this is a individual walk and by this being an individual walk we respect that office that's why you tell us they talk about trump i said no bro don't do that i said i i said don't do that because god taught us to respect that office you just make that office you know why i could be right here president of the united states four years i'm going benjamin could come here he's the president of the united states he could be going but what is it called see us because of authority comes with that office in that position is that right so we really have to you have to use wisdom so you're respecting that office that god has put in here to move you into perfection he said i sent you an apostle a prophet pastor teacher and evangelist for the perfecting of the saints for the maturing of the saints for the working of the ministry to edify the body the body the body the body of jesus christ it's a war and you have to be taught to use that weapon the right way and now you're really changing when you go into the military you go in there as a civilian and when you go in there as a civilian now they bring you to boot camp they're training you he says he told us by when i was putting on the whole armor of god to do what he said for what what weapon the helmet of salvation is that right he didn't teach the corinthians those things in episodes he told him what the weapons were you are getting what you're getting through that ministry is because god knows you can handle it he put you there because he hit him he hit him for years he was obedient he was humble he did what he was supposed to do he was faithful to his position now much more is required through all of us let me keep going so i maybe i can get to some of some of those quotes i know i've been quoting but i want to read a few of them he said but look he said in verse 3 he says and i was with you in weakness and fear and they're much trembling and my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man's wisdom but in demonstration of the what and of the what that your what not should be standing in the what but in the what ah i heard the holy ghost see there's no way you move and let the holy ghost work through you what he put in you how he you can operate no other way you see so that's what we're moving into in in this hour so when god has called you he's called you for a purpose let me keep going hallelujah we can go back over to uh who's the acts he said now peter peter stood up there and he said you men of judea verse 14 and all you that dwell at jerusalem i'm in chapter 2 and verse 14 the book of acts he said for these are not drunken as you supposed to see but the third hour of the day but this is is that which was spoken by the prophet joel and it shall come to pass in the what last days say of god i will pour out my what upon what and your sons and daughters shall what prophesies and your young men shall see visions and the old men shall dream dreams he said and all my servants and all my handmaids i will pour out in those days of my spirit and they shall prophesize now look verse 22 he says ye men look at peter the boldness now he's the men of israel hear these what now you see why the devil keeps trying to get them the mix the multitude to rush your pastor when he's up there trying to give you something none of us is no match for satan but the holy ghost says that he send you here anything that come to hinder him you're precious as i shared with you before i'm not even worthy to stand here for god in front of god's royal people chosen priesthood he came down and not die for each and every one of us god came now hid himself in that seas some of them were in the preaching losing man talking about a man no no no no no no no god identified his servant this is my servant only servant to move into the end time he had three names means what completion is that right seven letters in each each one of them seven seven letters completion three perfection that right three names seven letters nobody but god knock the dust off your feet let them go on and keep kicking up against that wall you don't have to argue with nobody huh brother says huh you don't have to argue with no no we got what thus say to the lord peter didn't cast nothing he said by his what words look what peter did though he wasn't playing with him now he caught the revelation ah the grace that was extended to peter huh peter gardner took away that hot temper of peter the guy that peter could have been wasn't charged with killing chopping off a man in he said what but what god we preach what the lord tell them peter we did not live by the sword don't you realize i can pray and call the angels down the angels down here he said peter now i'm going to hide the evidence peter you see what i'm saying don't you do that again peter i'm going to take it i'm gonna put it up there is that right huh peter i got work for you to do peter huh only god can destroy the evidence through the blood of jesus christ is that right is what king wants to weigh my sins nothing but the blood of jesus what can make me whole again nothing but the blood of jesus when huh don't try don't let nobody try to resurrect the old you the oh you is dead brother the old dead they're gone brother that's life's over with you have the royal blood they can't even find you [Music] this thing is real buddy oh hallelujah who could peter say you men of israel these words of nazareth amend what approved of god among by miracles wonders and signs hallelujah give them a clap offering things [Applause] the holy ghost what it was sinful power and prayer live a holy life peter power of speech he said you men of israel he says jesus of nazareth a man approved of god among you by miracles and signs and god by which him in the midst of you as ye yourselves also know you're witnessing god's opening that word unfolding that word you know no man can't open that word like that it's only the god is in our midst what am i saying give god the glory give him the praise give him the honor he deserves his things the power of the holy ghost was come it's sin so you can finish this work anyone that's struggling out there in their life we know that they're really thirsting for god and when they're thirsting for god and we have to recognize that it's not about us it's about christ what he's sending us here to do whatever you're struggling with you judge the lord have already took care of it you see he's already took care of it so when they cast so when the word comes you received the word and now you're receiving what brother greg the holy ghost now the word comes you are only struggling with these things is because you won't let the holy ghost take over you won't let the holy ghost do it so now you're struggling in your mind so those things that satan try to bring back to you christ already took care of it on calvary everything is a finished work and so that's why when you're obsession you stop receiving the wrong thoughts what you gotta receive what did god tell you to do he said cast down every imagination and try to exhort itself against the lord brothers did i tell you when the holy ghost had you say that that was powerful it could only be one priest on this high priest on the scene at one time is that right but what was the battle going to be the battle was going to be with the words there's going to be in the scriptures that's going to be on the end time but that's why when it came to jesus he came to jesus with the scriptures so we have to understand now you won't let the devil you won't let god just as he says just get put it in neutral and just let god take care of it because satan is going to fight you he's going to come at you first it's going to come right at your mind but we have to realize now put on the whole arm of god think of your salvation what the lord have already did for you on calvary if you had the baptism of the holy ghost the holy ghost is going to resurrect that word that's inside of you that's what he's going to resurrect he said he would bring every promise unto your what to your remember is that right then come on forth musicians come on musicians when they come around and we just want you to say we just want you to realize what the lord has really really done for us that's why sister when you sing that song god is good huh when god is good you meditate on that song don't let it come just a repetition to you because you let you sing it to the glory of god anytime to any enemy come in you got to have a song there on your heart and then when you had that song on your heart now you give them praises is that why brother steve when paul and silas i heard what you told us what the holy spirit said to us that back there in weeks what did he say it's not dues or don'ts in this message when peter in the jail the humble brother robert when they locked him up beat him up mercifully hung there all night and they got in there and when they looked around they had them in chains they had the prisoners and chains and when they had them down in the chains they had peter and silas and they was whipping them there all through the night and now they're whipping their through tonight they thought peter and them really they thought peter and silas went to the jail just for the the charge that the jews had been charging them with but god sent them to the jail for another reason huh we send us god vindicates what he sent us there for it was a jailer in there he needed to know about the gospel he sent peter and saul is in there and when he got around in there and they would burn down and peter them they started whooping him i can hear him now say god is good all the time put a song of praise in this heart of mine god is good all [Music] god is good and then what happened the jail started shaking the foundation of the jail it started shaking it shook it up the jail the chains flew off the jail flew open the jailer wanted to commit suicide he said hold still we all here then what did he say did he tell him to stop drinking no tell him to stop smoking no brother steve he said what believe on the lord jesus christ huh you in your household you know shall be saved hallelujah hallelujah give us a song brother hallelujah hello god did you know what happened brother god is good huh you know that one brother seth god is

there is power [Music] precious [Music] is [Music] [Music] in the blood [Music] oh [Music] amen thank you lord amen brother shangri did you want to dismiss us in prayer amen blessed be the name of the lord how many enjoy the service tonight amen do you know the good thing about wednesday when you come in you feel tired and everything and before you go you feel like you want to dance and continue dancing you feel like you're free have more energy amen the holy ghost he can never never never over emphasize on the need of the holy ghost amen and when he was talking about brother brown i'm holding that line for so long and i thought about it i said yes that's why we need the spoken word where we don't have to hold the line no longer anymore where we can just speak the word and everything is gone amen remember the faith of mary believing the impossible by just accepting what the angels have said that's it how are you gonna have that pregnancy i don't know have did it happen before i have no record but god says so a virgin shall conceive am i a virgin yes so i take that word and move on and before you know it something begin to happen amen she didn't even feel anything she went speaking the word of jesus christ then he quickened john the baptist amen oh my god the power of the holy spirit continue praying always well amen there is nothing to fear god have everything under control amen everything is under control i was sitting there and i can see how he's touching the colors of the tabernacle one by one and he doesn't even know that i have been studying on those things in the tabernacle amen i don't know it depends on the boss how he's pushing the brakes amen but i can see left and right how he's touching the the curtains of the tabernacle one by one and say my god amen he even touched on the message on sunday already amen there's nothing out of control that's why first you got to know who you are where you're coming from who where you are then things begin to change in your life that's the mystery brother branham was unfolding under that slave that was walking with his chest up despite the treatment he didn't work anything against him amen his attitude was up way up when somebody looked at him and said why is that person different than all of them do you treat them different no do you do something different no is he sleeping in a different place than they are there no so what's happened and uh and the buyers say i was also wondering myself until i come to realize that what happened is his origin amen his origin make him behave a different way and that origin gave him power to ride over the circumstances of slavery without really feeling slavery he's working as a slave but he doesn't feel it amen you fishing peter but your fishing is a leisure to get money out of it at the beginning he was working working working you go home you tired but this kind of fishing is sent by the master you go fish and open the mouth what do you think amen i work all night there is nothing take the net cast it and you pull it what did you do what did you do no work still doing the same thing and then they begin to call the other die guys come here come here come here why that is the that just knowing who you are changed that slave mentality the slave was not worrying about his geographic spot location that was not his problem as long as he understood who he was even if he's in a strange land he still behave like a child of the king when everybody is beat down they depress they don't know what to do the economy is bad the business begin to run low everything it seems to be crushing there is another strength that is coming up when everybody's perplexed you see somebody standing up and just rejoicing whoa that that's what you need to be until somebody will ask who's that why are you always happy why are you not scared why are you not worrying about everything that is happening all over the world and then they will find also your story and this time it's a different story you say beyond the edges of time i came from a lineage that lineage is an eternal lineage it's a lineage of melchizedek i am from that lineage and even though i'm still in this world going through everything i'm going it doesn't change who i am and because of that it gives me strength of what is going on on the world till you numb do you know what numbing have you been there the doctor and they give you a shot and you can't feel nothing amen yet they are operating on you but you don't feel anything because something numb you that's the power of knowing who you are amen that's the power of knowing who you are it doesn't that when when you when you receive that revelation that slave was not rich that slave didn't even have a bank account but just that revelation was enough to give him boldness you don't need to have money in the bank account to become bolden that's proud that's proud because you're looking at the money now you're trying to show off at the beginning you were humble that's proud but whether i have it or not i'm just that's a different thing that one is a revelation a revelation of knowing who you are what is your lineage what is your father so i'm not caring about who's there whining whining whining over there the other slaves are winding that was not his problem when they gave him five he start working he finished boss anything else no i finished thank you very much and he's going doing the same task but why is he not feeling the pain there is something about the revelation i don't even know how to express when you are afraid your whole house is anointed with that revelation with that anointing anybody you understand do you understand what i'm saying if a past if we get caught up in what is good happening in this world we won't have service in this place [Music] i will be the only one preaching here and everybody at home streaming everybody here but if that revelation comes differently amen when you get in this place you even forgot we're under a pandemic you don't even remember there is a pandemic going on you don't even understand that outside there there is a new strain that came up why are you not scared why you keep shaking hand why are you not scared because there is something in you and when the death that's why you heard brother branham say when the devil sees that when the devil sees that the demon themselves back up you don't see them they just back up you going to walmart you going to walgreen who is disinfecting the the the door of walgreen who is disinfecting the door of your job because everybody is holding the same door dog open and close who's there sitting when the first employee comes they pray the second employee come this prayer he will be tired what tells you in that door knob there is not covered anybody here what tells you there is no coffee what tells you that cashier where you who's disinfecting the credit card machine where we're swapping the card like this did you see people standing there and wiping the credit card machine why they don't wipe anybody here the devil knows who you are [Applause] anybody here anybody here when you touching that door knob the germ is saying not this one how many people cough around you go take a test we might find all of us head covered some felt it some didn't even feel it amen but who was protecting you because the revelation is already what i'm saying i'm not talking about this mind i'm talking about this mind when this mind is rapture do you follow me when it's taken up to a certain level and he sees things differently you don't feel what is going on if you don't understand my language this is what makes somebody graduate from college because the man that they are looking at i want to be this so even though they are struggling studying they don't sleep well but because of that vision it is making them keep going through and before you know it at the end of college they sit they say am i the one who did this it was that vision that was carrying you up if you lose that then everything become to normal then you move from here up here you begin to reason then phil grab you anybody that's what it is this man right here it's powerful if you understand if you just let him and the lord deal keep talking to god this man is powerful amen amen these men are here when you're not afraid the germ knows that you are not afraid brother branham say even a dog knows that you are not afraid anybody care if you talk to somebody and you really know what you're talking about that person senses that's why you see you talking about the same thing and they complicate somebody and they let you pass somebody come and say i want to pass but when they look at your face he said go ahead where's your id why did they make him go there is something when this man is awakened he anoints you and when your family look at you they see mommy a certain way and the children also get courage and the whole house is changing and you sitting there you don't even instead of talking about oh did you see the number going up you talking about did you hear the sermon on something amen and the more you talk about the sermon guess who's coming in your home the same man will step in your home and before you know it you begin to talk and one of this day you're gonna hear one of your child speaking in tongues because you are creating an atmosphere and the devil when the sunset those demons themselves go away and you can go to sleep without any problem you're just sitting like this and before you know it it's it's time to go to work i feel and somebody else cannot sleep because too much on this the sleepness is gone you you you have even over time you're looking for more time to sleep they say how can you sleep in this situation yes because i have a high priest that died for me when he died for me he wiped everything don't you resurrect my past anymore no fishing amen no fishing [Music] oh my god let me stop before i start preaching let's pray heavenly father lord we thank you again father for your grace for your love and for your mercy father for speaking to us again about the holy spirit lord we know that probably some of us are still struggling of certain things and the only thing is they don't want to let it go if lord we can self-examine ourselves and make sure that between that which we are struggling and as there is not a love connection if there is a pure separation in the inner man there is no way that demon can stand anymore because there is no ground father lord may the holy spirit continue to minister to your children lord strengthen your children and let them be enraptured into the reigns into the dimension of revelation and vision because that is what is keeping us moving forward despite the opposition despite the trial despite the battle we can keep our head up knowing lord father that there is a hope and a reward on the other side father i'm committing every single one that is online for the following that you may minister to them as well lord every demon that has been bordering your children left and right upon the authority of the word i don't even have to scream but they know who we are because we are that chosen generation father may they depart from your children and may your children be completely free and may lord the holy spirit only that you have purpose in your heart to work lord and to prepare the believer until we reach the stature that you want us to reach may the holy spirit only minister to us we seal the devil and his army out we welcome only the holy the elect angel of god and the holy spirit lord because we are chosen generation father we are precious in your sight lord we commit the remaining of the week and the remaining of the year unto the hand father remove every hindrance any battle every spirit of accident or death or tragedy or trouble to your children lord father protect us all under the blood lord we committed and asked it in the name of jesus christ amen go ahead baby amen y'all are dismissed as we sing this we'll sing a couple as you all go what can wash away nothing but the blood of jesus and what can be [Music] is [Music] nothing [Music] is
