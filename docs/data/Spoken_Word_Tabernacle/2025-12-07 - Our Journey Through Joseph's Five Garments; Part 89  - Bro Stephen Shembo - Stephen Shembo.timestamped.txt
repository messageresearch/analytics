[27:43] Tuesday.
[27:45] Uh she was short on her rent, which she
[27:47] was due which was due on Tuesday.
[27:50] Uh she was doing Uber Eats, trying to
[27:52] make a little money, you know, make up
[27:54] the rest of the money for the rent.
[27:56] Brother Angelo said he gave her
[27:58] everything he had on him at the time,
[28:00] but it wasn't enough to cover what she
[28:02] needed. He didn't catch her name, but he
[28:06] said, "Let's pray that God provides
[28:07] everything she needs and reveals himself
[28:09] to her in an undeniable way." Amen.
[28:13] Praise God.
[28:15] &gt;&gt; And uh I also have have one as well. I
[28:19] don't know. I think I've mentioned a
[28:21] friend of mine that was in Desert Storm
[28:22] with me. He's developed um pancreatic
[28:25] cancer
[28:27] and uh I haven't had an opportunity yet.
[28:29] Every time we try to plan to go down
[28:30] there, it's a it's not a good day. So,
[28:32] you know, we respect that. But um he
[28:36] sent me a text yesterday and just
[28:38] thanked me for the love that I've shown
[28:40] him, you know, through text and stuff
[28:43] and and uh and I reexpressed that and
[28:46] and explained to him that I, you know,
[28:49] he knew he knew back then that um we
[28:52] were trying to begin to start serving
[28:56] the Lord according to this message. And
[28:58] and I told him, I said, you know,
[29:00] brother, I still believe in a God with
[29:02] divine healing, divine intercession and
[29:04] divine healing. I'm kind of getting the
[29:06] feeling from his text, just the fact
[29:08] that he sent it out that he's given up.
[29:10] He's accepting that he's not going to
[29:11] make it. His name is Fred Harris. He
[29:14] lives down in Elgen, South Carolina.
[29:17] And uh it's just been on my heart since
[29:20] I learned of his diagnosis.
[29:24] Um you know, you develop bonds. They're
[29:26] not always good as far as some of the
[29:28] relationship, but um
[29:32] you know, we serve together in in in
[29:34] Desert Storm and um you do form a bond
[29:37] regardless. And I just I just got a
[29:41] burden for him in my heart and I just
[29:42] want to share it with y'all that y'all
[29:44] can help me pray for him. Amen. So, I'm
[29:47] going to ask um I'm going to ask brother
[29:49] Michael Omach to come up and uh pray
[29:52] over these things. and he told me his
[29:55] family is doing fine as well. So, we
[29:57] want to thank the Lord for that.

[53:48] write scripture so we went we had even
[53:50] one person who was not even a message
[53:52] believer

[54:12] myself because it was vow in the
[54:15] scriptures after scripture after
[54:17] scripture after they got so many
[54:19] scripture in the vow. A vow is a
[54:21] dangerous thing.
[54:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. Asked them yesterday.
[54:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. The Bible say he binds your soul.
[54:29] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[54:29] &gt;&gt; I brought that from the Bible yesterday.
[54:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:33] Amen.
[54:33] &gt;&gt; He brands your soul and you are binding
[54:35] your soul by a word.

[54:46] &gt;&gt; Don't joke with your word.
[54:49] &gt;&gt; Because you're going to get bind.
[54:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. But brother Brandham say it's not
[54:54] even a preacher that bind you.
[54:56] &gt;&gt; Jesus.
[54:56] &gt;&gt; I gave them a coach yesterday. Brother
[54:58] Brandham say it's not a preacher that
[55:00] marries you. He said you are married by
[55:03] your own word,
[55:04] &gt;&gt; by your promise. He say it's not a
[55:06] magistrate. It's not even a preacher.
[55:08] What we do here, we just sanction
[55:11] &gt;&gt; what you already have done somewhere
[55:13] else.
[55:14] &gt;&gt; So I told them, young man, it's not
[55:16] about decoration going in downtown and
[55:19] put uh candles all over and make a big
[55:22] show. I say you will be in trouble,
[55:25] &gt;&gt; right?
[55:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[55:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:31] &gt;&gt; What did I tell you yesterday? I say if
[55:33] I preach this to married people
[55:35] &gt;&gt; because we do vow by traditions.
[55:38] &gt;&gt; We just repeat what people are doing and
[55:41] we grew up we saw wedding and
[55:42] everything. Do you know what you're
[55:44] saying?
[55:44] &gt;&gt; When we give you the microphone, we give
[55:46] this one the microphone. You are sealing
[55:49] your life to death.
[55:51] [laughter]
[55:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:54] &gt;&gt; If you have any question, ask them. They
[55:56] will give you scripture after scripture
[55:58] after scripture. When we finish then we
[56:00] pick up brother Brandham and you should
[56:02] see how everything is lining up with the
[56:05] word. It's impossible for this message.
[56:07] It's it it's God.
[56:10] &gt;&gt; This message is nobody but God
[56:13] &gt;&gt; to line up. When brother Brham was
[56:15] speaking, he didn't give all the
[56:16] scripture I gave yesterday.
[56:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen.
[56:19] &gt;&gt; Brother Brham just laid the foundation.
[56:21] And when we took the scripture and took
[56:23] the message and put it together, hand
[56:24] and glove fitting all together.
[56:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[56:28] &gt;&gt; So I warned them stay away from trouble.
[56:31] &gt;&gt; I told them I said you have a free way
[56:33] to not make any mistake
[56:36] &gt;&gt; and marry without any problem and we
[56:38] don't have to deal with anything because
[56:40] a vow is a dangerous thing.
[56:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:45] &gt;&gt; So parent let's stick with what we are
[56:48] teaching the children here because I'm
[56:50] pulling that from the Bible and from the
[56:52] message of the hour.
[56:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. I don't want to deal with divorce
[56:56] cases.
[56:57] &gt;&gt; No, sir.
[56:59] &gt;&gt; No, sir.
[56:59] &gt;&gt; In your generation, I don't want to deal
[57:01] with divorce cases. You get married once
[57:03] for eternity.
[57:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.

[57:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:22] &gt;&gt; We clear so far?
[57:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. And then I thought, whoever miss
[57:25] yesterday, make sure you follow up with
[57:28] the deacon because I will hold you
[57:30] responsible for what I preached
[57:32] yesterday.
[57:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:34] &gt;&gt; And any marriage contrary to what I
[57:37] taught you yesterday, I am now going to
[57:39] bless you.
[57:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:43] &gt;&gt; You will find another pastor to bless
[57:45] you. I am now going to bless you because
[57:47] I want to stay there and when we cross
[57:50] on the other side, I want to be free to
[57:52] go to heaven. Amen.

[58:04] question about marriage before we solve
[58:06] this problem. Amen.

[1:09:13] blessing to come in your life so we can
[1:09:15] do things like that.
[1:09:17] &gt;&gt; That's correct, brother.
[1:09:18] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:09:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:20] &gt;&gt; When am I going to start preaching
[1:09:21] because you keep moving like this?
[1:09:25] [laughter]
[1:09:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Sister Sharon
[1:09:30] gave you the trip uh the report for the
[1:09:33] trip from Florida.
[1:09:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:35] &gt;&gt; So everybody's clear on the report from
[1:09:37] trip from Florida, right?
[1:09:39] &gt;&gt; Everybody's clear. Sister Sheron gave it
[1:09:42] and everything. You know how Sister
[1:09:43] Sheron gave it? She really pull up
[1:09:46] everything. I was like, "Oh my god."
[1:09:48] Some of them I was not even trying to
[1:09:49] mention them. And here she pull
[1:09:51] everything. Amen.
[1:09:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:53] &gt;&gt; But thank you very much for allowing us
[1:09:55] to have a time to go. Usually we are I'm
[1:09:59] vibrating on a different wavelength
[1:10:01] [laughter]
[1:10:03] &gt;&gt; and and sometime if you don't pay
[1:10:05] attention you will forget that you
[1:10:06] married and you have children.
[1:10:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:10:10] &gt;&gt; So sometime you do a Navy Seal
[1:10:12] operation, you come down
[1:10:14] &gt;&gt; and you pick them up and tell them
[1:10:17] daddy's around, husband is around, then
[1:10:19] you go back up again and you continue
[1:10:22] learning. So everybody is at peace at
[1:10:24] home.
[1:10:25] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:10:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:27] &gt;&gt; Do you know that Rebecca told brother I
[1:10:29] won't marry a preacher.
[1:10:30] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHAT SHE SAID.
[1:10:32] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHAT SHE SAID.
[1:10:33] &gt;&gt; AH, you need a coat.
[1:10:35] &gt;&gt; Do you know that?
[1:10:37] &gt;&gt; Because of the way brother was moving.
[1:10:39] Exactly right.
[1:10:40] &gt;&gt; Until brother Brandham and then she
[1:10:41] came, she corrected. She say, "You know
[1:10:43] what? I will begin to travel with my
[1:10:45] husband if he's a preacher."
[1:10:47] &gt;&gt; That's exactly.
[1:10:48] &gt;&gt; Do you see what I'm saying? Because you
[1:10:49] need to balance things together.
[1:10:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. As a minister, as a pastor, I'm
[1:10:55] going in the different wavelength. But
[1:10:57] sometime you got to remember you got
[1:10:58] people that are not in the same
[1:11:00] wavelength with you. So sometime you got
[1:11:03] to drop a little bit and fellowship
[1:11:05] together and then you come back up again
[1:11:07] and you continue to sow. So now when I'm
[1:11:10] soaring they happy over there. I'm also
[1:11:12] happy over there and everybody's minding
[1:11:14] their businesses.
[1:11:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:18] &gt;&gt; Because we are still in this flesh.
[1:11:21] [applause]
[1:11:22] &gt;&gt; You didn't get me well. We are still in
[1:11:24] this flesh.
[1:11:25] &gt;&gt; So you need to be mindful of the spirit
[1:11:26] and also the flesh. So there is a time
[1:11:29] to talk about the word and there is a
[1:11:32] time to eat food.
[1:11:35] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:11:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:37] &gt;&gt; There's a time to put the Bible aside
[1:11:39] and to bring food.
[1:11:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:41] &gt;&gt; And to eat food.
[1:11:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:43] &gt;&gt; You got to balance the two together.
[1:11:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:11:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:47] &gt;&gt; So they were happy enjoying over there.
[1:11:50] And sometime I sleep up and sit down and
[1:11:53] uh go with my reading and my Bible and
[1:11:55] everything. So by God's grace, all is
[1:11:58] going well and everything went well by
[1:12:00] God's grace. There's a couple that are
[1:12:03] part of the invisible audience. They
[1:12:04] live there. They bought a house. I know
[1:12:08] how to suffer for getting a house by
[1:12:10] God's grace and God open up. It's a
[1:12:12] season. They jump in the water and in a
[1:12:15] miraculous way, God gave them a a
[1:12:17] beautiful house.
[1:12:19] &gt;&gt; And uh and I already planned my
[1:12:21] operation a long time ago. I was
[1:12:22] studying Florida, studying the map and
[1:12:25] everything and and so before I get
[1:12:27] there, I was already in Florida. So by
[1:12:29] God's grace, when I got there, I didn't
[1:12:31] tell them anything.
[1:12:33] &gt;&gt; Uh I just gave some signal, but they
[1:12:36] were not uh uh perceiving the the the
[1:12:40] signal. So I have to drop on my
[1:12:42] operation. My wife didn't even know
[1:12:43] about the trip. My family didn't know. I
[1:12:46] just told them maybe two or three days.
[1:12:48] I say, "Pack, we going
[1:12:50] &gt;&gt; are we going alone?" I said, "No, I'm
[1:12:52] I'm going with you." So, everything
[1:12:55] worked out pretty good. We got there. I
[1:12:57] got there. I called the brother and he
[1:12:58] was on the phone. I say, "Somebody's
[1:13:00] ringing at the door." He says, "Really?"
[1:13:02] I say, "Yes, go check it." He comes out.
[1:13:04] He looked, he said, "Pastor Steven."
[1:13:06] [laughter]
[1:13:11] Amen. Wow. The wife was at work and she
[1:13:15] felt like, "What is God?" Brother Steven
[1:13:17] is here. So it was I say I didn't want
[1:13:19] to say anything before somebody called
[1:13:21] me to preach somewhere and say go preach
[1:13:23] over there. I didn't go to preach. I
[1:13:25] went to just take a break and then uh
[1:13:27] begin to to move on. That's why I did it
[1:13:29] that way. So but God grace everything
[1:13:31] went I say I came to dedicate your house
[1:13:35] &gt;&gt; and they were not ready. So they say
[1:13:37] pastor you need to come back and
[1:13:38] everything. So by waiting to come back
[1:13:42] what they did they begin to call people
[1:13:43] that are not in the message.
[1:13:47] Amen. Amen. That's it right there,
[1:13:49] brother. Amen. Amen.
[1:13:51] &gt;&gt; And the total was 28 people.
[1:13:53] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:13:57] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:13:58] &gt;&gt; That's good enough, right? We can start
[1:14:00] preaching.
[1:14:01] &gt;&gt; 28. Oh, it's good enough. So, we stop
[1:14:04] right here.
[1:14:04] &gt;&gt; Oh, okay. So, 28 people were invited.
[1:14:09] So, I got there and I say, "Okay, I'm
[1:14:11] coming. I'm going to pray for your house
[1:14:13] and move on and go." The brother sat
[1:14:15] down. He said, "Brother Steven, no, no,
[1:14:17] no, no, no, no. Please, pastor, you need
[1:14:18] to go. We invited a lot of people. You
[1:14:21] need to say something." I said, "Oh my
[1:14:22] God."
[1:14:24] &gt;&gt; I said, "I didn't prepare for this." He
[1:14:26] said, "No, no, no, no. Pastor, please
[1:14:27] go. Come at 9 when everybody's coming.
[1:14:30] You need to preach a little something."
[1:14:39] &gt;&gt; And among all of them, if I'm not
[1:14:41] mistaken, only two were message
[1:14:43] believer.
[1:14:45] And there was even a Pentecostal
[1:14:46] preacher right there.
[1:14:49] &gt;&gt; So I sat down. I say, "Okay, we going
[1:14:52] home."
[1:14:53] &gt;&gt; And I say, "Here I come. I'm now put on
[1:14:55] a preaching right here."
[1:14:57] &gt;&gt; I begin to go home. When I begin to
[1:14:59] focus and meditate, a whole brand new
[1:15:03] sermon broke.
[1:15:06] &gt;&gt; Why do we dedicate a home?
[1:15:09] &gt;&gt; I never even know that sermon. I don't
[1:15:11] even know what it is. I got in the
[1:15:13] hotel, a scripture came. A scripture, a
[1:15:15] scripture, a scripture. Before you know
[1:15:17] it, a whole sermon. I need to preach to
[1:15:19] Somebody need to buy a house so I can
[1:15:21] preach.
[1:15:23] [laughter]
[1:15:24] [cheering]
[1:15:31] &gt;&gt; I know I got to dedicate few more houses
[1:15:33] here. Sister Miriam, there is two more
[1:15:36] brother. I' never been brother Chris and
[1:15:38] there is brother Dina. I went to his
[1:15:40] home. I've dedicated. He bought another
[1:15:41] house. So I already it's brother Chris's
[1:15:44] sister and there is another one that I
[1:15:46] need to dedicate the home. So I'm I'm
[1:15:48] going to work with you. I don't know. I
[1:15:50] was just going for vacation. He turned
[1:15:52] up for something. But brother a whole
[1:15:54] sermon open. Even a quote came up.
[1:15:58] &gt;&gt; I can take that same sermon and even
[1:16:00] preach to you the Holy Ghost.
[1:16:02] &gt;&gt; Why do you dedicate a house? Why do we
[1:16:04] call a preacher to dedicate a home?
[1:16:06] &gt;&gt; So there were people pulling. So by
[1:16:09] God's grace, I'm going to ask the
[1:16:10] brother because he recorded to take the
[1:16:12] sermon so we would load it on YouTube.
[1:16:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:17] &gt;&gt; Brother, I got there. I got back. I look
[1:16:19] a lot of people that were there and it
[1:16:22] turned to a service. The presence of the
[1:16:24] Lord came down. You should hear in
[1:16:26] Pentecost people that are not in the
[1:16:28] message how they praying.
[1:16:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:30] &gt;&gt; And the word soaking. I don't I won't
[1:16:32] say anything. Just call the brothers and
[1:16:34] ask them what is even the preacher that
[1:16:36] was there was looking for my number.
[1:16:38] They gave him the the YouTube channel
[1:16:41] here. He's a Pentecostal preacher.
[1:16:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. They told him about the ant. He
[1:16:45] went to his own church and preached the
[1:16:47] mystery. Preach the ant. The church was
[1:16:49] on fire.
[1:16:50] &gt;&gt; Yes, SIR.
[1:16:53] [applause]
[1:16:58] [cheering]
[1:16:59] &gt;&gt; The people of his church are asking him,
[1:17:01] "Where are you getting this revelation?"
[1:17:03] Come on. [laughter]
[1:17:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:09] &gt;&gt; The Lord came down. It was such a
[1:17:12] blessing in a supernatural way. Amen.
[1:17:15] And there was a family that came here
[1:17:18] one time from Florida. They part of the
[1:17:20] invisible audience. They in Miami. And
[1:17:22] they used to stream. And one day they
[1:17:24] went all the way they came. I believe it
[1:17:27] was the wife uh uh birthday or something
[1:17:30] like that. So the husband took her all
[1:17:32] the way from Florida to here just to
[1:17:34] make sure we get it. But by God's grace
[1:17:36] when they told me to go the first time I
[1:17:39] look and I called sister Jerusha. It was
[1:17:42] probably a month when we spoke. She
[1:17:43] didn't know that I was coming there. So
[1:17:45] I I sent some drone and she didn't
[1:17:48] understand what I was saying until I
[1:17:50] told her. I said, "You remember me
[1:17:51] talking to you that day?" And guess
[1:17:53] what? I got on the road and I went I
[1:17:55] traveled two hours all the way to see
[1:17:57] sister Jerus.
[1:17:59] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY
[1:18:01] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[1:18:04] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:18:05] &gt;&gt; I got there. I saw brother Robert over
[1:18:08] there. [laughter]
[1:18:11] [applause]
[1:18:12] &gt;&gt; Now we turn into another fellowship with
[1:18:15] brother Robert and sister and sister
[1:18:17] Adasa. So we spent time two hours again
[1:18:20] drove all the way back to Orlando. So
[1:18:22] there was a family that came here one
[1:18:24] time and as we were going there I told
[1:18:27] my wife I say would you check that
[1:18:29] family because I was trying to see where
[1:18:31] they are uh compared to the place that
[1:18:33] we were staying. So my wife contacted
[1:18:36] her them uh the wife she didn't uh the
[1:18:39] sister she didn't respond so I was like
[1:18:42] this is gone but this is what the Lord
[1:18:44] did. I'm just going to say this then we
[1:18:46] go to the word of the Lord. Amen. If
[1:18:48] you're tired so we stop right here.
[1:18:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. So I didn't know myself that that
[1:18:54] family already plan
[1:18:57] &gt;&gt; to come on Thanksgiving right here.
[1:19:01] So they want to they say, "Brother
[1:19:03] Stephen, we were trying to get a
[1:19:04] surprise trip
[1:19:06] &gt;&gt; and they book the Airbnb in Charlotte
[1:19:10] &gt;&gt; and they rented a brand new van
[1:19:13] &gt;&gt; and they got in the car in Florida and
[1:19:16] as they were moving coming to North
[1:19:17] Carolina did not know that I was already
[1:19:20] in Florida. Their van broke down. A
[1:19:23] brand new van broke down
[1:19:26] &gt;&gt; on the road in Florida. They tried to
[1:19:29] get any other new car. Thanksgiving week
[1:19:31] booked. No car. They got stuck there.
[1:19:34] Before you know it, they were unable to
[1:19:36] come to North Carolina. And they changed
[1:19:38] their mind. And the husband say, "You
[1:19:41] know what? Let's just go to Orlando."
[1:19:43] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:19:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:51] &gt;&gt; They got to Orlando. When they heard it,
[1:19:54] it was like the sister was in explosion.
[1:19:57] I didn't understand. They gave the
[1:19:59] address. I key the address. They were 15
[1:20:01] minutes from where I was.
[1:20:03] &gt;&gt; My God.
[1:20:03] &gt;&gt; Wow. My God.
[1:20:06] &gt;&gt; God.

[1:20:16] big family in spoken word.

[1:20:21] &gt;&gt; THERE WERE NINE PEOPLE. NINE PEOPLE. Are
[1:20:24] we together? We spend time like it was
[1:20:27] heaven. They look at me, they say, "You
[1:20:29] don't have no clue what your ministry is
[1:20:31] doing in Florida." Right here.
[1:20:33] &gt;&gt; Then they begin to give me testimony. I
[1:20:35] was talking about sister Aos and then
[1:20:37] the healing. Didn't know another sister
[1:20:40] got healed in Florida.
[1:20:44] &gt;&gt; With kidney problem,
[1:20:47] [applause]
[1:20:51] &gt;&gt; are we together? THE FELLOWSHIP WAS SO
[1:20:53] GOOD. I look at the time we were already
[1:20:56] pass the getting passing the time we had
[1:20:59] to head to the airport. I said the
[1:21:00] brother we need to cut this and go. I
[1:21:03] got into the car flying toward the
[1:21:05] airport. Got there everything. I got
[1:21:08] there the train was there. We take the
[1:21:09] train. We got there. The train was
[1:21:11] there. We got there. I got on the
[1:21:12] airplane. They say which group is it? It
[1:21:15] was group.
[1:21:18] &gt;&gt; And we just walked straight inside the
[1:21:20] airplane.
[1:21:21] &gt;&gt; I didn't even sit at the airport.
[1:21:23] straight inside the airplane. And here
[1:21:25] I'm in North Carolina. God knows how to
[1:21:28] orchestrate things.
[1:21:31] [cheering]
[1:21:33] Yes, sir.
[1:21:34] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Everything is working
[1:21:37] together for good.
[1:21:39] &gt;&gt; It looks like the car was broken down.
[1:21:42] They want to come. They didn't know God
[1:21:45] was telling them, "THE MAN YOU SEEKING
[1:21:47] IS RIGHT HERE,
[1:21:49] &gt;&gt; AND I'M GOING TO TAKE YOU CLOSER TO
[1:21:51] HIM." 15 minutes in Orlando. GOD IS
[1:21:55] [screaming] ALIVE.
[1:21:56] &gt;&gt; THE HOLY SPIRIT IS ALIVE. THAT'S THE
[1:22:00] SAME GOD THAT BROUGHT YOU TO THIS
[1:22:01] MESSAGE.

[1:22:07] CLAP OFFERING. [applause and cheering]

[1:22:47] minute. Are we together?
[1:22:50] &gt;&gt; We clear.
[1:22:51] &gt;&gt; So now let's go to the reading of the
[1:22:53] word.
[1:22:55] &gt;&gt; Flight attendant, prepare for takeoff.
[1:22:59] &gt;&gt; Ah, spoken word tabernacle. It has been
[1:23:02] a long time since we seen each other on
[1:23:05] Wednesday on Sunday.
[1:23:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. [laughter]
[1:23:08] &gt;&gt; It feels like eternity. Amen.
[1:23:11] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Oh my. What I was supposed
[1:23:15] we stopped somewhere couple weeks ago
[1:23:19] and we were supposed to pick up where we
[1:23:21] stop and get in your life. But what was
[1:23:23] supposed to be preached here today has
[1:23:26] been moved
[1:23:29] to probably next Sunday because in
[1:23:31] Florida in Orlando things were coming
[1:23:34] up. [laughter]
[1:23:35] &gt;&gt; So I had to take note quickly in
[1:23:37] Orlando. And I tried to use that and
[1:23:40] move forward but I could not. It keep
[1:23:41] opening up. It keep opening up. So we
[1:23:44] will today's sermon is move to next
[1:23:46] Sunday and today it's something
[1:23:49] different.
[1:23:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:51] &gt;&gt; So you will stay alert
[1:23:53] &gt;&gt; and focus
[1:23:56] &gt;&gt; Yeshua
[1:23:58] you need to stay really really focused
[1:24:01] &gt;&gt; because it's a different route.
[1:24:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:04] &gt;&gt; So let's pray. Heavenly father Lord we
[1:24:07] are approaching you humbly this morning.
[1:24:09] Father, thanking you for your grace,
[1:24:11] your love, your mercy, for everything
[1:24:14] you're doing in this church and all over
[1:24:16] the world for your children. The glory
[1:24:19] is not unto a man. The glory is unto
[1:24:22] you, the Lord Jesus, because you deserve
[1:24:25] it and you have been so good to us. To
[1:24:28] see the miracle and the things that
[1:24:30] you're doing in the lives of the people
[1:24:32] beyond these four walls, Father,
[1:24:35] &gt;&gt; it is amazing and it's mindblowing. But
[1:24:38] it's your grace and we will see more
[1:24:40] unfolding Lord. Father as the time Lord
[1:24:43] Jesus Christ permit until you come.
[1:24:45] Father this is as far as I can go with
[1:24:48] the ability you have given me Lord when
[1:24:51] it comes to speaking to your children.
[1:24:53] Lord we pray that you come down and move
[1:24:55] me and the audience completely away. May
[1:24:58] you touch baby Tony and heal him
[1:25:00] completely Lord Father by the power of
[1:25:03] the Holy Spirit. And Lord, come and
[1:25:05] speak to our soul and seal every demonic
[1:25:08] spirit away from this place, Lord, in
[1:25:11] the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.
[1:25:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:14] &gt;&gt; Let's go to Exodus 34.
[1:25:18] &gt;&gt; You see where we we are? We are in
[1:25:20] Exodus 34.
[1:25:24] [clears throat]
[1:25:25] If we would preach what we can preach.
[1:25:29] My theme. Let me give you the title.
[1:25:34] Oh, glory to God. My title is our life
[1:25:38] journey through Joseph's five garment
[1:25:42] part 89.
[1:25:46] &gt;&gt; Ah, spoken word.
[1:25:49] Amen.
[1:25:50] &gt;&gt; We are still on the second garment
[1:25:52] [laughter] and we are on part 89. I
[1:25:56] don't know when we going to get into the
[1:25:57] fifth garment.
[1:25:59] &gt;&gt; [laughter]
[1:26:00] &gt;&gt; Which part are we going to be? Amen.
[1:26:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:05] &gt;&gt; My theme, if we can get it, is a
[1:26:09] mysterious.
[1:26:12] Remember what was supposed to be
[1:26:14] preached today has been pushed. A
[1:26:17] mysterious season.
[1:26:20] A mysterious season
[1:26:27] in the parable
[1:26:33] of
[1:26:36] the 10 pounds.
[1:26:40] &gt;&gt; You're going to learn that parable if
[1:26:42] you don't read your Bible.
[1:26:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:46] &gt;&gt; Do you know the parable of the 10
[1:26:48] pounds?
[1:26:50] You know the talent
[1:26:52] &gt;&gt; but today you will learn about the
[1:26:54] pound.
[1:26:55] &gt;&gt; In another scripture they call that the
[1:26:57] miners.
[1:26:58] &gt;&gt; You will see it's written in other
[1:27:00] translation they call that the either
[1:27:02] manas or minas or whatever it's the same
[1:27:05] thing. But the King James version use
[1:27:08] pounds. Are we together?
[1:27:10] &gt;&gt; So please stay really focused.
[1:27:13] If I see you lingering, I would push the
[1:27:16] brake because these are material you
[1:27:17] need to stay focused. We clear
[1:27:20] &gt;&gt; Genesis Exodus 34. If you dare, you can
[1:27:23] say amen.
[1:27:25] &gt;&gt; You see, we're in Genesis, but we are
[1:27:27] going to talk about the parable over
[1:27:29] there. So, we got to blend Genesis and
[1:27:32] the New Testament. We clear?
[1:27:35] &gt;&gt; Verse one. And the Lord said to Moses,
[1:27:40] "You," in other word, cut out,
[1:27:44] &gt;&gt; in other word, go chop
[1:27:46] &gt;&gt; Moses, you can be seated so we can begin
[1:27:49] to so help me move with the the reading.
[1:27:53] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:27:54] &gt;&gt; In other words, Moses have to do some
[1:27:57] work,
[1:27:57] &gt;&gt; right? [laughter]
[1:27:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:00] &gt;&gt; In other word, Moses have to get a tool.
[1:28:04] Maybe a shop tool. Stay very spiritual.
[1:28:08] Keep your seat belt.
[1:28:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:10] &gt;&gt; Moses have to get a shop tool.
[1:28:13] &gt;&gt; We touch up on this in the hotel. Moses
[1:28:16] have to get a sharp tool
[1:28:18] &gt;&gt; and go and begin to cut.
[1:28:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:22] &gt;&gt; To cut a rock.
[1:28:26] &gt;&gt; Okay, let's read it. The Bible say, "And
[1:28:29] the Lord said to Moses,
[1:28:31] &gt;&gt; you you in other words, cut out
[1:28:36] &gt;&gt; water, two tables of water,
[1:28:39] &gt;&gt; stone."
[1:28:39] &gt;&gt; So those table must be in a stone.
[1:28:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's correct. Amen.
[1:28:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:46] &gt;&gt; Those table must be in a rock.
[1:28:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:50] &gt;&gt; Or maybe in a in a rock or in a
[1:28:53] mountain.
[1:28:54] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:28:55] &gt;&gt; Somewhere. Amen.
[1:28:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:58] &gt;&gt; And the stone are inside there.
[1:29:01] &gt;&gt; Just like the the image of Michelangelo,
[1:29:04] &gt;&gt; the stone are inside there.
[1:29:06] &gt;&gt; So Moses the prophetes.
[1:29:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:10] &gt;&gt; Have to get a tool.
[1:29:12] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:29:13] &gt;&gt; And a sharp tool.
[1:29:15] &gt;&gt; Because and and go to the mountain.
[1:29:18] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. And when he get
[1:29:21] to the mountain, HE NEED TO START
[1:29:23] CUTTING the stone
[1:29:25] &gt;&gt; because Moses needed a piece of stone,
[1:29:29] two pieces, the table
[1:29:31] &gt;&gt; to pull them from the mountain.
[1:29:33] &gt;&gt; So it's a prophet with a tool
[1:29:35] &gt;&gt; toward the mountain.
[1:29:41] &gt;&gt; And some are still warming the engine.
[1:29:44] &gt;&gt; Let me start it again [laughter]
[1:29:46] because I can't I can't let you go.
[1:29:48] There is a prophet, a major prophet.
[1:29:52] &gt;&gt; By the name of Moses,
[1:29:54] &gt;&gt; a prophet that God talked to him face to
[1:29:57] face.
[1:29:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:29:59] &gt;&gt; Without any parable.
[1:30:02] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:30:02] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:30:03] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE GOD SAY WITH a prophet I speak
[1:30:06] different
[1:30:07] &gt;&gt; but with Moses I SPEAK TO HIM FACE to
[1:30:09] face.
[1:30:10] &gt;&gt; So Moses was a special prophet.
[1:30:14] And even Jesus Christ have to come in
[1:30:16] the magnitude of Moses
[1:30:20] &gt;&gt; because Moses said the Lord your God
[1:30:23] will send you a prophet like unto me.
[1:30:26] &gt;&gt; Jesus have to come at the magnitude of
[1:30:29] Moses.
[1:30:30] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together.
[1:30:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:32] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together.
[1:30:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:34] &gt;&gt; Are we clear?
[1:30:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. So God told that prophet, he said,
[1:30:37] "GO TO A MOUNTAIN."
[1:30:41] &gt;&gt; And take a sharp tool.
[1:30:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:45] &gt;&gt; And go and cut.
[1:30:47] &gt;&gt; So the PROPHET WILL PICK UP A SHARP tool
[1:30:51] &gt;&gt; and cut the mountain.
[1:30:54] &gt;&gt; We are together.
[1:30:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:56] &gt;&gt; WHEN HE CUT, HE PULL a piece off the
[1:30:58] mountain.
[1:31:00] &gt;&gt; BUT NOTHING IS WRITTEN ON THAT PIECE.
[1:31:06] Are we together?
[1:31:08] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:31:11] &gt;&gt; I'M ALREADY IN THE VISION OF JUNIOR
[1:31:13] JACKSON.
[1:31:16] &gt;&gt; I'M ALREADY IN THE VISION OF GINA
[1:31:18] JACKSON.
[1:31:19] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE JUNIOR JACKSON, BROTHER, BROTHER
[1:31:21] WAS STANDING BY A MOUNTAIN AND A
[1:31:23] CROWBAR, SOMETHING LIKE A CROWBAR CAME.
[1:31:26] BUT WHEN THE INTERPRETATION CAME, he was
[1:31:29] not a crowbar. He was THE SWORD OF THE
[1:31:32] king
[1:31:33] &gt;&gt; and HE WAS THE SWORD THAT HE CHOPPED THE
[1:31:36] MOUNTAIN. AND WHEN HE CHOPPED THE
[1:31:37] MOUNTAIN, A PIECE CAME OUT. BUT NOTHING
[1:31:41] WAS WRITTEN IN THAT PIECE.
[1:31:43] &gt;&gt; But the WORD MUST BE INTERPRETED BY FROM
[1:31:46] THE UNWRITTEN PIECE.
[1:31:51] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? Help me leave the
[1:31:54] airport, my friend.
[1:31:56] &gt;&gt; Have I lost you?
[1:31:58] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:31:58] &gt;&gt; Have I lost you?
[1:31:59] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. It's not powerful.
[1:32:01] &gt;&gt; Moses
[1:32:02] &gt;&gt; get in the mountain
[1:32:04] &gt;&gt; with a sharp tool cut up the m the
[1:32:07] stone. When he come up with the stone,
[1:32:09] if you notice the stone doesn't have any
[1:32:12] writing.
[1:32:14] &gt;&gt; So Moses have to take the stone.
[1:32:16] &gt;&gt; That's correct.
[1:32:17] &gt;&gt; And go with that in the mountain
[1:32:20] &gt;&gt; to get the interpretation
[1:32:23] &gt;&gt; right
[1:32:23] &gt;&gt; of the unwritten stone
[1:32:26] right there. That is my brother.
[1:32:31] &gt;&gt; YES SIR.
[1:32:32] &gt;&gt; BROTHER BRHAM CUT OUT THE MOUNTAIN, OPEN
[1:32:35] UP AND SAW A STONE WITH NO WRITING AND
[1:32:39] BROTHER BRANDHAM HAVE TO GO TO SUNSET
[1:32:41] MOUNTAIN TO GET THE INTERPRETATION
[1:32:44] OF THEIR WRITTEN WORD.
[1:32:47] &gt;&gt; I HOPE we are together.
[1:32:50] Some of you are not synchronizing.
[1:32:54] We need to send more energy. Amen.
[1:32:56] [laughter]
[1:32:57] Are we together?
[1:32:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:58] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:32:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:00] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:33:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:01] &gt;&gt; So when you see Moses going to the
[1:33:03] mountain, you say, "What is this?" He
[1:33:04] say stone. What is written on it?
[1:33:06] Nothing.
[1:33:07] &gt;&gt; Nothing.
[1:33:08] &gt;&gt; But those stone got scripture.
[1:33:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:11] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:33:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:12] &gt;&gt; So Moses has to go to the mountain for
[1:33:15] God to write
[1:33:17] &gt;&gt; to interpret
[1:33:19] &gt;&gt; the scripture.
[1:33:21] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:33:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. Uh if you slow I won't finish this
[1:33:25] to get to the parable.
[1:33:26] &gt;&gt; Are we clear?
[1:33:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:28] &gt;&gt; The Bible say and the Lord said to
[1:33:29] Moses, you you out you uh you you two
[1:33:33] tables of stone like to the water.
[1:33:36] &gt;&gt; The first
[1:33:36] &gt;&gt; So there were two tables of stone. The
[1:33:38] first one was broken and destroyed.
[1:33:40] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:33:40] &gt;&gt; And remember the first one was already
[1:33:42] written.
[1:33:43] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:33:43] &gt;&gt; But the second one have have the
[1:33:45] unwritten part.
[1:33:47] &gt;&gt; Remember the pyramid of Junior Japson.
[1:33:49] The first part was written.
[1:33:52] Amen.
[1:33:54] &gt;&gt; The mountain of Junior Jackson have
[1:33:56] riding all around
[1:33:58] &gt;&gt; but on the top there was a part where
[1:34:00] brother Brandham cut it was the
[1:34:02] unwritten one.
[1:34:04] &gt;&gt; And Moses have two tables of law.
[1:34:06] &gt;&gt; The first one was already written but
[1:34:08] the second one he's taking to the
[1:34:10] mountain have no writings.
[1:34:11] &gt;&gt; This message is perfectly in line with
[1:34:14] the Bible.
[1:34:15] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together.
[1:34:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. [laughter]
[1:34:18] &gt;&gt; Do you read your message?
[1:34:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. go in the message, sir, is this
[1:34:23] the time of the end time or something
[1:34:25] like that. Oh, sir, what time is it? Go
[1:34:28] listen to that sermon.
[1:34:29] &gt;&gt; Can I continue?
[1:34:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:30] &gt;&gt; If you have a hard time swallowing this,
[1:34:32] what is coming up might be too strong.
[1:34:35] &gt;&gt; Okay, we clear.
[1:34:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:37] &gt;&gt; We clear?
[1:34:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:38] &gt;&gt; And mo and God say like unto the first,
[1:34:41] and I will do what?
[1:34:43] &gt;&gt; Write upon the stone.
[1:34:44] &gt;&gt; So, who's going to write on the stone?
[1:34:46] &gt;&gt; God.
[1:34:47] &gt;&gt; Remember who's going to write on the
[1:34:48] stone?
[1:34:49] &gt;&gt; God. So God is the one doing the
[1:34:51] writing. [music]
[1:34:52] &gt;&gt; God will write on the stone. Moses bring
[1:34:57] the stone and God is supposed to write.
[1:35:01] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:35:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:04] &gt;&gt; Please, you can't sleep. It's the devil.
[1:35:07] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:35:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.

[1:35:28] &gt;&gt; On Wednesday, we had a wonderful service
[1:35:31] &gt;&gt; this Wednesday. Amen.
[1:35:33] &gt;&gt; And the Holy Spirit came down
[1:35:36] &gt;&gt; and some of you received the Holy Ghost.
[1:35:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:35:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:41] &gt;&gt; On Wednesday,
[1:35:43] &gt;&gt; are we together?
[1:35:44] &gt;&gt; Are we together? The Lord opened up a
[1:35:47] door to outpour the Holy Ghost on
[1:35:49] someone.
[1:35:50] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:35:52] &gt;&gt; And it was a wonderful service.
[1:35:55] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:35:56] &gt;&gt; Because brother Tony was used by God to
[1:35:59] come straight with a sermon that is
[1:36:02] called receive ye the Holy Ghost.
[1:36:05] &gt;&gt; Are we together? It was a special grace
[1:36:08] by God that brought the Holy Spirit.
[1:36:12] &gt;&gt; But I WANT YOU TO BE VERY CAREFUL.
[1:36:15] &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit doesn't come only with a
[1:36:18] sermon that is called Holy Ghost.
[1:36:25] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? BECAUSE MESSAGE
[1:36:28] BELIEVER are used TO TRADITION.
[1:36:32] &gt;&gt; They were here. We have to preach what
[1:36:33] is the Holy Ghost. What was the HOLY
[1:36:36] GHOST GIVEN FOR? HOW DO YOU RECEIVE IT?
[1:36:39] And we need TO MAKE A LONG PRAYER LINE
[1:36:42] TO LAY HAND ON THE PEOPLE TO RECEIVE THE
[1:36:45] HOLY GHOST.
[1:36:46] &gt;&gt; BUT GOD CAME ON THE WEDNESDAY AND
[1:36:49] BROUGHT THE HOLY GHOST.
[1:36:50] &gt;&gt; THE HOLY GHOST IS ALWAYS AVAILABLE IN
[1:36:54] EVERY SERMON. [cheering and applause]

[1:40:22] GOD TODAY. I FEEL ANOINTED. I DON'T FEEL
[1:40:25] ANOINTED. WE DON'T WANT THAT.

[1:40:53] NOW? YOU STUCK AND THE DEVIL WOULD TELL
[1:40:54] YOU YOU DON'T HAVE IT. DEVIL, IT'S NOT
[1:40:57] IN MY FLESH.
[1:40:59] &gt;&gt; THAT IS THE FIRST POOL.
[1:41:01] &gt;&gt; IT IS NOT IN MY SPIRIT. THAT'S THE
[1:41:03] SECOND POOL. IT IS SOMETHING WAY BEYOND
[1:41:06] IN MY SOUL
[1:41:08] &gt;&gt; THAT AGREE WITH THE WORD OF GOD
[1:41:10] [cheering]
[1:41:11] FOR MY TIME. [screaming]

[1:41:19] &gt;&gt; I'M LEAVING THE AIRPORT, MY FRIEND. KEEP
[1:41:21] YOUR SEAT BELT. THE AIRPLANE IS GOING ON
[1:41:23] LIKE THIS. [cheering] WHENEVER WE
[1:41:25] PREACHING THE WORD, YOU ARE AVAIL.
[1:41:37] HALLELUJAH.
[1:41:40] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham say the message of the
[1:41:43] seven angel came to deliver us from the
[1:41:45] tradition of the world.
[1:41:47] &gt;&gt; And which traditional
[1:41:49] &gt;&gt; and Pentecostal tradition
[1:41:52] &gt;&gt; receive the Holy Ghost. Receive the Holy
[1:41:54] Ghost and they push you even they push
[1:41:55] you and then you fell and then you
[1:41:57] didn't feel anything
[1:41:58] &gt;&gt; because you have another expectation.
[1:42:01] You have a wrong interpretation.
[1:42:05] &gt;&gt; Who lay hand on who on the day of
[1:42:07] Pentecost?
[1:42:11] &gt;&gt; ANSWER MY QUESTION. WHO LAY HAND ON WHO?
[1:42:14] On the day of Pentecost, who was laying
[1:42:17] hand ON PEOPLE? THEY WERE ALL SITTING
[1:42:20] AND THE HOLY GHOST CAME.
[1:42:28] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:42:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:29] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER?
[1:42:30] &gt;&gt; AMEN. WHO LAY HAND ON THE DAY OF
[1:42:32] PENTECOST BECAUSE JESUS PHYSICAL WAS NOT
[1:42:34] THERE.
[1:42:35] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY BROTHER BRANDHAM SAY ONE DAY
[1:42:37] IT WON'T BE THE LAYING ON HAND OF THE
[1:42:40] PEOPLE. IT WILL BE THE HOLY GHOST
[1:42:41] HIMSELF
[1:42:42] &gt;&gt; WILL LAY HAND ON YOU
[1:42:49] &gt;&gt; I have a question.
[1:42:50] &gt;&gt; I have a question. IF A MINISTER PRAY
[1:42:53] for you
[1:42:54] &gt;&gt; to receive the Holy Ghost
[1:42:56] &gt;&gt; and you believe you receive the Holy
[1:42:58] Ghost
[1:42:59] &gt;&gt; and that minister backs lead from the
[1:43:01] message.
[1:43:02] &gt;&gt; ARE YOU GOING TO ACCEPT YOUR HOLY GHOST
[1:43:04] OR NOT?
[1:43:08] &gt;&gt; I DON'T PLAY GAME. I'M USING A DIFFERENT
[1:43:11] BAZOOKA NOW.
[1:43:13] &gt;&gt; ARE YOU GOING TO BELIEVE DID YOU RECEIVE
[1:43:16] THE HOLY GHOST OR NOT?
[1:43:18] &gt;&gt; IN OTHER WORD PREACHER, GET THE PREACHER
[1:43:20] OUT.
[1:43:25] I HOPE YOU UNDERSTANDING ME.
[1:43:28] &gt;&gt; PREACHER SO AND SO PRAY FOR MY HOLY
[1:43:30] GHOST. NOW THE PREACHER LEFT THE
[1:43:32] MESSAGE. NOW DID YOU RECEIVE THE HOLY
[1:43:34] GHOST OR NOT? IT IS NOT THE EVIDENCE OF
[1:43:37] A PREACHER. LET'S GO BACK TO THE WORD.
[1:43:40] &gt;&gt; LET'S GO BACK TO THE [cheering] WORD.
[1:43:41] &gt;&gt; WHEN THE WORD [screaming] IS COMING AND
[1:43:44] I RECEIVE THE WORD,
[1:43:46] &gt;&gt; I DON'T CARE ABOUT THE PREACHER. I'M
[1:43:48] CARING ABOUT THE WORD. HEAVEN AND EARTH
[1:43:51] WILL PASS AWAY, BUT MY WORD WILL REMAIN
[1:43:54] FOREVER.
[1:43:59] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:44:01] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:44:02] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:44:03] &gt;&gt; IF THE PREACHER WHO PRAYED for you, you
[1:44:06] see him in weaknesses.
[1:44:08] &gt;&gt; So what are you going to do?
[1:44:09] &gt;&gt; Ah, he prayed for me. But look at what
[1:44:11] he did. Did I GOT THE HOLY GHOST OR NOT?
[1:44:14] THE TIME HAS COME TO GET THAT ALL OUT OF
[1:44:17] THE WAY. I DIDN'T GET THE HOLY GHOST
[1:44:19] FROM HIM. I GOT THE HOLY GHOST FROM THE
[1:44:22] WORD.
[1:44:23] [applause]
[1:44:25] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:44:26] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:44:27] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER?
[1:44:28] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:44:28] &gt;&gt; AND JESUS SAID, "THE WORD THAT I SPEAK
[1:44:31] TO YOU,
[1:44:32] &gt;&gt; THE WORD THAT I'M SPEAKING," IN OTHER
[1:44:34] WORDS, WHEN JESUS IS SPEAKING, THERE IS
[1:44:36] A SPIRIT AND LIFE
[1:44:38] &gt;&gt; IN THAT WORD. [screaming]
[1:44:43] &gt;&gt; IT IS NOT THE WRITTEN WORD. [screaming]
[1:44:45] IT IS THE LOG GHOST,
[1:44:48] &gt;&gt; THE ANOINTED WORD, [cheering] THE PILLAR
[1:44:51] OF FIRE,
[1:44:52] &gt;&gt; THE WORD THAT IS LIVING AND ABIDE THERE
[1:44:56] FOREVER.

[1:45:38] &gt;&gt; PETER WAS STILL TALKING. HE DIDN'T
[1:45:41] FINISH THE SERMON TO START THE PRAYER
[1:45:43] LINE WHILE PETER IS TALKING. THE HOLY
[1:45:46] GHOST INTERRUPTED.
[1:45:49] [cheering]
[1:45:51] &gt;&gt; YOU DON'T HAVE TO WAIT FOR THE END OF
[1:45:53] THE SERVICE.
[1:45:55] &gt;&gt; WHEN THE WORD IS COMING,
[1:45:59] [applause and cheering]
[1:45:59] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together.
[1:46:01] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[1:46:02] &gt;&gt; GO TO THE BOOK OF ACT.
[1:46:04] &gt;&gt; GO LISTEN. GO READ the sermon of Peter.
[1:46:07] Yes sir.
[1:46:07] &gt;&gt; PETER WAS NOT PREACHING about the Holy
[1:46:09] Ghost.
[1:46:10] &gt;&gt; HE WAS PREACHING ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE.
[1:46:12] &gt;&gt; INTRODUCING TO THEM JESUS CHRIST.
[1:46:14] &gt;&gt; AND THE HOLY GHOST CAME.
[1:46:16] &gt;&gt; THE BIBLE SAY WHILE PETER YET WHAT
[1:46:19] &gt;&gt; SPAKE THESE WORDS.
[1:46:20] &gt;&gt; IT MUST BE FROM THE SPOKEN WORD. THE
[1:46:22] WHAT?
[1:46:22] &gt;&gt; HOLY GHOST
[1:46:23] &gt;&gt; FELL ON SOME OF THEM.
[1:46:25] &gt;&gt; ALL.
[1:46:26] &gt;&gt; ON HOW MANY PEOPLE?
[1:46:27] &gt;&gt; ALL.
[1:46:28] &gt;&gt; THAT DID WHAT?
[1:46:29] &gt;&gt; WHICH HEARD THE WORD.

[1:46:32] &gt;&gt; FAITH COMETH FROM WHAT?
[1:46:34] &gt;&gt; HEARING.
[1:46:34] &gt;&gt; THE HOLY GHOST IS COMING. FAITH IS A
[1:46:38] REVELATION. THE HOLY GHOST IS A
[1:46:40] REVELATION OF JESUS CHRIST PERSONALLY TO
[1:46:43] YOU.
[1:46:45] &gt;&gt; SO WHEN I'M PREACHING RIGHT NOW, IT
[1:46:47] DEPENDS ON WHAT YOU WANT.
[1:46:49] &gt;&gt; THE HOLY GHOST CAN FEED YOU.
[1:46:52] &gt;&gt; THE HOLY GHOST CAN HEAL YOU. [screaming]

[1:59:06] &gt;&gt; and the Holy Ghost is straightening.

[2:03:45] &gt;&gt; Uh-huh. AND HE WAS THERE HOW MANY DAYS?
[2:03:47] &gt;&gt; With the Lord 40 days
[2:03:48] &gt;&gt; and water.
[2:03:49] &gt;&gt; And 40 nights. and water.
[2:03:50] &gt;&gt; He didn't neither eat bread
[2:03:52] &gt;&gt; nor drink water.
[2:03:53] &gt;&gt; How did he survive?
[2:03:56] &gt;&gt; I HAVE A I'M READING THE BIBLE. MOSES
[2:03:59] DIDN'T drink water.
[2:04:01] &gt;&gt; Didn't eat bread for how many days?
[2:04:04] &gt;&gt; 40 days.
[2:04:05] &gt;&gt; How was he alive?
[2:04:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:11] &gt;&gt; WHAT HAPPENED TO THE BODY OF MOSES?
[2:04:16] &gt;&gt; WHAT HAPPENED TO THE BODY OF MOSES?
[2:04:18] AMEN.
[2:04:19] &gt;&gt; REMEMBER WHEN THEY TOOK THE MANA
[2:04:22] &gt;&gt; AND THEY PUT IT IN THE HOLIEST,
[2:04:24] &gt;&gt; THE MANA WAS NOW ROTTEN.
[2:04:28] &gt;&gt; SO WHAT HAPPENED TO THE BODY OF MOSES?
[2:04:34] &gt;&gt; It got quickened.
[2:04:38] &gt;&gt; IF THE SAME SPIRIT
[2:04:40] &gt;&gt; THAT ROSE CHRIST FROM THE DEAD DWELLETH
[2:04:43] IN YOU, HE SHALL DO WHAT?
[2:04:45] &gt;&gt; YOUR WHAT?
[2:04:46] &gt;&gt; Your mortal body.
[2:04:50] AMEN.
[2:04:51] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY THE MAMBA HIT PAUL AND PAUL
[2:04:54] SHAKE IT
[2:04:55] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE INSIDE PAUL THERE WAS something
[2:04:58] &gt;&gt; there was electricity
[2:05:01] &gt;&gt; ENERGY.
[2:05:03] &gt;&gt; A POWERFUL ENERGY.
[2:05:05] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER?
[2:05:06] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:05:07] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER?
[2:05:08] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:05:08] &gt;&gt; THE BIBLE SAY FOR 40 DAYS AND 40 NIGHT
[2:05:11] HE DID neither eat water
[2:05:13] &gt;&gt; bread
[2:05:13] &gt;&gt; nor water
[2:05:14] &gt;&gt; drink water. And he wrote, who wrote?
[2:05:17] &gt;&gt; Moses,
[2:05:18] &gt;&gt; not God. Upon what?
[2:05:19] &gt;&gt; The tables of the words of the covenant.
[2:05:21] &gt;&gt; Uh-huh.
[2:05:22] &gt;&gt; And 10 and the ten commandments.
[2:05:23] &gt;&gt; OKAY. AND IT CAME TO PASS WHEN MOSES
[2:05:26] CAME DOWN FROM MOUNT Sana
[2:05:29] &gt;&gt; with the two table of the testimony in
[2:05:32] Moses' hand. When he came down from
[2:05:34] what?
[2:05:35] &gt;&gt; The mount.
[2:05:36] &gt;&gt; That Moses knew not.
[2:05:40] &gt;&gt; Continue. The skin that the skin of his
[2:05:43] FACE
[2:05:43] &gt;&gt; THE SKIN OF WHAT?
[2:05:45] &gt;&gt; His face.
[2:05:47] &gt;&gt; SO THE FACE OF MOSES
[2:05:49] &gt;&gt; was doing what?
[2:05:50] &gt;&gt; Shining.
[2:05:53] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:05:55] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:05:57] &gt;&gt; IT LOOKS LIKE OUT OF ALL THE ENTIRE BODY
[2:06:01] OF MOSES,
[2:06:02] &gt;&gt; THERE WAS SOMETHING ABOUT HIS FACE.
[2:06:09] If not, we will stop and go home the way
[2:06:12] you guys are acting.
[2:06:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:06:17] &gt;&gt; This is Moses.
[2:06:18] &gt;&gt; He got charge.
[2:06:20] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:06:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:06:22] &gt;&gt; And he cannot eat
[2:06:24] &gt;&gt; or drink even water
[2:06:26] &gt;&gt; for 40 days.
[2:06:28] &gt;&gt; THEN AS MOSES COME, MOSES didn't know
[2:06:31] that all the electricity
[2:06:33] &gt;&gt; concentrate TO HIS FACE.
[2:06:37] SO THE FACE OF MOSES,
[2:06:41] &gt;&gt; THE FACE of Moses
[2:06:43] &gt;&gt; was shining.
[2:06:46] &gt;&gt; AND MOSES DIDN'T KNOW.
[2:06:49] &gt;&gt; NOT THE BODY OF MOSES. FOLLOW ME.
[2:06:51] &gt;&gt; THE BODY WAS NOT SHINING.
[2:06:54] &gt;&gt; WHEN MOSES LEFT THE PRESENCE OF THE
[2:06:56] LORD,
[2:06:57] &gt;&gt; HIS FACE WAS SENDING LIGHT.
[2:07:02] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:07:03] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? AMEN.
[2:07:05] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:07:06] &gt;&gt; On the back there, I don't hear amen.
[2:07:08] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER?
[2:07:10] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER?
[2:07:11] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:07:13] &gt;&gt; Where are we at?
[2:07:14] &gt;&gt; VERSE 30.
[2:07:15] &gt;&gt; THAT MOSES KNEW NOT THAT THE SKIN OF
[2:07:17] WHAT
[2:07:18] &gt;&gt; his face
[2:07:19] &gt;&gt; while he talked with him. Uh did what?
[2:07:22] The skin of his face shone. While he did
[2:07:24] what?
[2:07:25] &gt;&gt; Talk with him
[2:07:26] &gt;&gt; with God. And when Aaron and all the
[2:07:28] children of Israel saw Moses, BEHOLD,
[2:07:31] THE SKIN of his face did what? Sure.
[2:07:34] &gt;&gt; AND THEY WERE AFRAID TO COME NEAR HIM.
[2:07:36] &gt;&gt; IN OTHER WORDS, AS MOSES IS APPROACHING,
[2:07:39] the people are backing up.
[2:07:41] &gt;&gt; MOSES DON'T UNDERSTAND. WHY ARE THE
[2:07:44] PEOPLE BACKING UP?
[2:07:48] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER?
[2:07:49] &gt;&gt; THERE WAS SOMETHING THAT HAPPENED TO
[2:07:51] MOSES
[2:07:53] &gt;&gt; THAT WAS MAKING HIS FACE
[2:07:56] &gt;&gt; TO SHINE.
[2:07:58] &gt;&gt; HIS FACE WAS SENDING LIGHT.
[2:08:01] HE WAS A FAC WITH LIGHT.
[2:08:06] &gt;&gt; I'm already going slowly now. I'm in
[2:08:08] surgery.
[2:08:09] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:08:11] &gt;&gt; Verse uh uh 31. And Moses called them.
[2:08:16] And Aaron and all the rulers of the
[2:08:18] congregation uh uh the congregation
[2:08:21] returned to him. In other words, Moses
[2:08:23] said, "Hey, Aaron." Because everybody's
[2:08:25] going back. He said, "Earon,
[2:08:28] &gt;&gt; uh, brother child, brother Angel, come,
[2:08:30] come."
[2:08:34] [laughter]
[2:08:34] &gt;&gt; Then everybody begin to come. Are we
[2:08:36] together? AND THEY RETURNED TO HIM AND
[2:08:39] MOSES TALKED with them.
[2:08:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:08:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:08:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:08:43] &gt;&gt; IT SEEMS LIKE MOSES HAD something to
[2:08:46] tell them.
[2:08:48] &gt;&gt; AND WHATEVER WAS IN MOSES
[2:08:50] &gt;&gt; WAS MAKING HIS FACE SHINE.
[2:08:53] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:08:54] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. Yes sir.
[2:08:56] &gt;&gt; Verse uh
[2:08:57] &gt;&gt; 32.
[2:08:58] &gt;&gt; 32. AND AFTERWARD the who?
[2:09:00] &gt;&gt; All the children of Israel
[2:09:02] &gt;&gt; came what?
[2:09:03] &gt;&gt; The whole congregation came.
[2:09:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. And he gave them in the what
[2:09:09] &gt;&gt; commandment.
[2:09:10] &gt;&gt; ALL THAT THE LORD HAD SPOKEN WITH HIM
[2:09:12] WHERE
[2:09:12] &gt;&gt; IN MOUNT SI.
[2:09:13] &gt;&gt; REMEMBER WHEN GOD WAS SPEAKING
[2:09:16] &gt;&gt; NONE OF THEM HEARD IT.
[2:09:20] &gt;&gt; THEY WERE HEARING ONLY THUNDERS.
[2:09:23] I HOPE WE ARE TOGETHER.
[2:09:25] &gt;&gt; SO WHEN GOD WAS SAYING I AM THE LORD
[2:09:28] &gt;&gt; IN ISRAEL it was
[2:09:32] &gt;&gt; and THE AND THE PEOPLE WERE SHAKING THEY
[2:09:34] SAY OH MY GOD BUT TO MOSES IS I AM THE
[2:09:37] LORD YOUR GOD
[2:09:39] &gt;&gt; YOU SHALL HAVE NO OTHER GOD IN THE CAMP
[2:09:42] THEREUM.
[2:09:46] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:09:47] &gt;&gt; AMEN. AMEN. SO THE WRITING THAT WAS ON
[2:09:51] THE ON THE TABLE WERE THUNDERS.
[2:09:53] [screaming]
[2:09:56] [cheering]
[2:10:01] [laughter]
[2:10:04] HALLELUJAH.
[2:10:06] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. GLORY. HALLELUJAH.
[2:10:11] &gt;&gt; God have been so good to me.
[2:10:14] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[2:10:15] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[2:10:17] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:10:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:10:19] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:10:20] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:10:20] &gt;&gt; WHEN GOD WAS SAYING YOU SHALL HAVE NO
[2:10:23] OTHER GOD
[2:10:25] &gt;&gt; AND MOSES RIGHT IN ISRAEL HE was
[2:10:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:10:33] IF YOU ASK ISRAEL, WHAT IS THE
[2:10:35] INTERPRETATION OF THE THUNDER? THEY
[2:10:37] DON'T KNOW. FOR YOU TO INTERPRET THE
[2:10:40] THUNDER, YOU NEED A PROPHET. [screaming]
[2:10:43] [cheering]
[2:10:48] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[2:10:49] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER?
[2:10:51] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER?
[2:10:52] &gt;&gt; YOU NEED A MOSES
[2:10:54] &gt;&gt; TO TELL YOU THAT
[2:10:58] &gt;&gt; MEANS I AM THE LORD YOUR GOD.
[2:11:01] &gt;&gt; [cheering]
[2:11:02] &gt;&gt; SO THE THUNDER WAS [screaming] THE WORD
[2:11:04] OF GOD.
[2:11:09] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER?
[2:11:10] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:11:10] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER?
[2:11:11] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:11:12] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER?
[2:11:13] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:11:15] &gt;&gt; So the face of Moses came with the word.
[2:11:19] &gt;&gt; And that word was the interpretation
[2:11:22] of the thunders.
[2:11:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:11:26] &gt;&gt; In other words, WHAT THE THUNDERS WERE
[2:11:28] SAYING.
[2:11:29] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. That's right. Yes, sir. Yes,
[2:11:31] sir.
[2:11:31] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:11:33] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:11:35] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:11:36] &gt;&gt; Energy. Are we together?
[2:11:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:11:38] &gt;&gt; Uh-huh. Where are we at, my friend?
[2:11:40] &gt;&gt; Verse 32.
[2:11:41] &gt;&gt; 32. And after all, all the children of
[2:11:44] Israel did what?
[2:11:45] &gt;&gt; Came nigh
[2:11:46] &gt;&gt; and did what?
[2:11:46] &gt;&gt; And he gave them in commandments.
[2:11:48] &gt;&gt; He gave them in the commandment all that
[2:11:50] the Lord did what?
[2:11:51] &gt;&gt; Had spoken with him in Mount Si.
[2:11:53] &gt;&gt; Watch this carefully
[2:11:55] &gt;&gt; because after this we stop preaching.
[2:11:57] &gt;&gt; Yes. Verse uh 32. AND TILL MOSES HAS
[2:12:02] DONE WHAT?
[2:12:03] &gt;&gt; Speaking with them
[2:12:04] &gt;&gt; with the congregation, he did what?
[2:12:06] &gt;&gt; Put a veil on his face.
[2:12:07] &gt;&gt; In other word,
[2:12:08] &gt;&gt; when Moses was coming,
[2:12:10] &gt;&gt; Moses was shining.
[2:12:13] &gt;&gt; EVERYBODY BACKED UP.
[2:12:14] &gt;&gt; MOSES SAID, "BE NOT AFRAID."
[2:12:16] &gt;&gt; IT IS.
[2:12:17] &gt;&gt; Come on. It is I.
[2:12:18] &gt;&gt; Take your time, brother.
[2:12:19] &gt;&gt; Take your time.
[2:12:23] &gt;&gt; Yes, SIR.
[2:12:24] &gt;&gt; HE SAY, "COME ALL OF YOU." AND THE
[2:12:26] CONGREGATION COME AND MOSES DELIVER THE
[2:12:30] SERMON.
[2:12:32] &gt;&gt; DAVID MOSES PREACHED THE THE THUNDERS.
[2:12:37] &gt;&gt; I'm watching my mouth.
[2:12:39] &gt;&gt; AND WHEN MOSES FINISHED PREACHING THE
[2:12:41] THUNDERS,
[2:12:42] &gt;&gt; he took a veil.
[2:12:45] &gt;&gt; My God. My God. My God.
[2:12:47] &gt;&gt; Amen, Lord.
[2:12:49] &gt;&gt; Amen, LORD.
[2:12:50] &gt;&gt; HE DIDN'T VEIL HIS BODY. HIS BODY WAS
[2:12:52] ALREADY HAVING CLOTHING,
[2:12:53] &gt;&gt; BUT HE ONLY VEILED WHAT? HIS FACE.
[2:12:57] &gt;&gt; We clear?
[2:12:59] &gt;&gt; We clear.
[2:12:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:13:00] &gt;&gt; Where are we at?
[2:13:01] &gt;&gt; WHEN MOSES DONE SPEAKING with them, HE
[2:13:04] PUT A WHAT?
[2:13:04] &gt;&gt; A veil on his face.
[2:13:06] &gt;&gt; Verse 34. BUT WHEN MOSES WENT in before
[2:13:10] the Lord to speak with him, with God, HE
[2:13:14] DID WHAT?
[2:13:14] &gt;&gt; He took the VEIL OFF.
[2:13:15] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:13:16] &gt;&gt; UNTIL HE DID WHAT?
[2:13:17] &gt;&gt; Came out.
[2:13:18] &gt;&gt; I hope we ARE TOGETHER.
[2:13:19] &gt;&gt; SO WHEN MOSES IS AROUND THE
[2:13:21] CONGREGATION, HE'S LIKE THIS.
[2:13:23] COME ON.
[2:13:24] &gt;&gt; WHEN MOSES GOES TO GOD, WHEN HE REACHED
[2:13:27] GOD,
[2:13:28] &gt;&gt; HE OPEN
[2:13:30] &gt;&gt; AND GOD TALKED TO HIM FACE TO WHAT?
[2:13:34] &gt;&gt; SO THE FACE OF MOSES
[2:13:37] &gt;&gt; AND THE [screaming] FACE OF GOD
[2:13:43] CHURCH. [music]
[2:13:47] &gt;&gt; YES SIR.
[2:13:48] &gt;&gt; CHURCH SIR.
[2:13:50] &gt;&gt; MY TIME IS RUNNING. YOU ARE WASTING
[2:13:52] TIME.
[2:13:53] &gt;&gt; I DIDN'T GO.
[2:14:00] &gt;&gt; My God.
[2:14:01] &gt;&gt; THIS IS GOD.
[2:14:02] &gt;&gt; GOD SAY ALL THE PROPHET
[2:14:05] &gt;&gt; I SPEAK TO THEM DIFFERENTLY.
[2:14:06] &gt;&gt; BUT MOSES I SPEAK TO HIM HOW
[2:14:08] &gt;&gt; face to face.
[2:14:11] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:14:12] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:14:13] &gt;&gt; AND WE FOUND OUT THAT WHEN MOSES CAME
[2:14:15] OUT HIS FACE CHANGED
[2:14:17] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE HE WAS SEEING SOMEBODY
[2:14:19] &gt;&gt; FACE TO FACE. SO THE FACE OF GOD AND THE
[2:14:22] FACE OF MOSES WERE LOOKING AT EACH OTHER
[2:14:25] &gt;&gt; UNTIL WHEN MOSES removed
[2:14:27] &gt;&gt; the light
[2:14:30] &gt;&gt; OF THAT FACE BECAME ON MOSES.
[2:14:34] [applause]
[2:14:36] [cheering]
[2:14:37] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together.
[2:14:39] &gt;&gt; I HOPE WE ARE TOGETHER.
[2:14:40] &gt;&gt; SO WHEN MOSES REACHED THE PEOPLE, HE
[2:14:43] DELIVERED THE LIGHT.
[2:14:45] &gt;&gt; IN OTHER WORDS, MOSES BECAME THE LIGHT.
[2:14:49] AMEN.
[2:14:53] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[2:14:54] &gt;&gt; My friend, this is ribs with bones.
[2:14:56] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:14:57] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER?
[2:14:59] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER?
[2:15:00] &gt;&gt; AND THE BIBLE SAY WHEN MOSES FINISHED
[2:15:02] TALKING,
[2:15:03] &gt;&gt; WHAT DID HE DO?
[2:15:05] &gt;&gt; His face.
[2:15:06] &gt;&gt; AND THEN HE GOES TO THE GENERATOR.
[2:15:09] &gt;&gt; AND WHEN HE REACHED THE GENERATOR,
[2:15:10] [screaming] HE OPENED THE FACE. AND THE
[2:15:13] GENERATOR BEGIN TO CHARGE.
[2:15:17] AH.
[2:15:18] &gt;&gt; [cheering]
[2:15:21] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? WHEN THE GENERATOR
[2:15:23] CHARGE CHARGE AND THE BATTERY IS FULL,
[2:15:26] &gt;&gt; MOSES CLOSES AGAIN
[2:15:28] &gt;&gt; AND HE GOES TO ISRAEL
[2:15:30] &gt;&gt; AND HE OPEN UP AND HE UNLOAD THE
[2:15:33] CHARGING
[2:15:34] &gt;&gt; AND THEN TOMORROW MOSES CLOSE.
[2:15:37] &gt;&gt; SO MOSES WAS [screaming] A BATTERY
[2:15:43] &gt;&gt; THAT WAS DISPATCHING CHARGES FROM GOD
[2:15:45] [screaming] TO THE PEOPLE. [cheering]
[2:15:51] THIS IS NOT ELEMENTARY MY FRIEND. I AM
[2:15:54] SOARING SOMEWHERE.
[2:15:55] &gt;&gt; CAN I CONTINUE?
[2:15:57] &gt;&gt; WHERE ARE WE AT, my friend?
[2:15:59] &gt;&gt; BUT WHEN MOSES WENT IN BEFORE THE LORD
[2:16:01] TO SPEAK WITH HIM, he did what?
[2:16:03] &gt;&gt; He took the veil OFF
[2:16:04] &gt;&gt; UNTIL HE DID WHAT?
[2:16:06] &gt;&gt; Because he's he's hooking the charging.
[2:16:08] &gt;&gt; THE FACE OF GOD is going toward Moses.
[2:16:10] &gt;&gt; And when he finished, Moses say,
[2:16:12] "Battery charge 100%."
[2:16:14] &gt;&gt; God say, "Go to the people." Amen.
[2:16:16] &gt;&gt; And Moses goes again and say where is
[2:16:17] your problem?
[2:16:18] &gt;&gt; Bring all your problem Israel hook the
[2:16:20] charging
[2:16:22] [laughter]
[2:16:22] &gt;&gt; the battery. Are we together?
[2:16:24] &gt;&gt; And the Bible say and the and and he
[2:16:27] came OUT AND HE CAME OUT AND SPOKE to
[2:16:29] water.
[2:16:29] &gt;&gt; Children of Israel
[2:16:30] &gt;&gt; that which he
[2:16:32] &gt;&gt; was command was command
[2:16:33] &gt;&gt; and the children of Israel saw the face
[2:16:35] of water
[2:16:36] &gt;&gt; Moses.
[2:16:36] &gt;&gt; SO GOD WAS TRANSFERRING HIS energy
[2:16:41] &gt;&gt; toward Moses.
[2:16:44] Amen. AND MOSES WAS REFLECTING GOD.
[2:16:48] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together.
[2:16:49] &gt;&gt; AND THE PEOPLE WERE SEEING GOD IN THE
[2:16:52] FACE OF MOSES.
[2:16:55] &gt;&gt; That's exactly right, brother.
[2:16:58] Amen.
[2:16:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:16:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:17:01] &gt;&gt; In other word, if you want to see the
[2:17:04] effect
[2:17:05] &gt;&gt; of God, the effect of God, go see the
[2:17:08] face of Moses.
[2:17:10] AMEN.
[2:17:10] &gt;&gt; WHEN YOU SEE MOSES, you are receiving
[2:17:13] the face of God.
[2:17:15] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:17:16] &gt;&gt; AND THE FACE OF GOD CAME WITH THE WORD
[2:17:18] OF GOD.
[2:17:20] &gt;&gt; THE INSTRUCTION THAT WAS GIVEN TO MOSES
[2:17:23] &gt;&gt; BY [screaming] GOD TO GIVE TO ISRAEL.
[2:17:26] &gt;&gt; THAT INSTRUCTION OF THE THUNDER GOES
[2:17:29] WITH THE FAITH
[2:17:31] &gt;&gt; THAT BRING LIGHT.
[2:17:35] &gt;&gt; SLOW DOWN. WE ARE SOARING MY FRIEND. Are
[2:17:38] we together?
[2:17:40] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:17:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:17:42] &gt;&gt; I know some of you. So Moses was God.
[2:17:44] Relax.
[2:17:45] &gt;&gt; Relax.
[2:17:46] &gt;&gt; Today you're going to swallow even
[2:17:47] bones. [snorts]
[2:17:49] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:17:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:17:51] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:17:52] &gt;&gt; You're going to crack some bones, my
[2:17:53] friend.
[2:17:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:17:54] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:17:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:17:55] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER?
[2:17:56] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:17:57] &gt;&gt; VERSE 35. LET'S GO.
[2:17:59] &gt;&gt; And the We read that.
[2:18:00] &gt;&gt; Lord.
[2:18:00] &gt;&gt; 35.
[2:18:01] &gt;&gt; And the children of Israel
[2:18:03] &gt;&gt; saw the face of Moses that the skin of
[2:18:05] Moses did what?
[2:18:06] &gt;&gt; Face shown. And Moses put the veil upon
[2:18:09] his face until he went to speak water
[2:18:12] &gt;&gt; with him.
[2:18:12] &gt;&gt; So when you see Moses, you don't see the
[2:18:14] head.
[2:18:16] &gt;&gt; The head of Moses doesn't exist anymore.
[2:18:19] &gt;&gt; When you see a face veil,
[2:18:21] &gt;&gt; h you know that it's Moses coming up.
[2:18:24] &gt;&gt; You will see him only when he got charge
[2:18:28] &gt;&gt; from God with a new message,
[2:18:31] &gt;&gt; with a new thunder
[2:18:33] &gt;&gt; and then he brings it and he deliver to
[2:18:35] you. Amen.
[2:18:36] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:18:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.

[2:19:39] talking. He's watching. I say, "You need
[2:19:41] to take note. You won't remember
[2:19:42] everything I'm saying."
[2:19:44] &gt;&gt; You're sitting like this. Okay. You
[2:19:46] finish, you go out. That's why you don't
[2:19:48] retain stuff.

[2:19:50] yourself.
[2:19:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:19:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:19:53] &gt;&gt; Verse one. And Jesus entered and passed
[2:19:56] through what?
[2:19:57] &gt;&gt; Jericho.

[2:20:02] &gt;&gt; Zakius. which was the chief among what?
[2:20:06] &gt;&gt; The publicans.
[2:20:06] &gt;&gt; Remember two of Jesus disciple were also
[2:20:09] publicans.
[2:20:11] &gt;&gt; It was Matthew and Leva.
[2:20:14] &gt;&gt; It's in your Bible.
[2:20:15] &gt;&gt; They were they were public. THEY WERE
[2:20:17] TAX COLLECTORS.
[2:20:19] &gt;&gt; CPAS.
[2:20:23] &gt;&gt; Have I say something wrong?
[2:20:25] &gt;&gt; Are we together? I'm bringing the word
[2:20:27] flesh.
[2:20:28] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:20:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:20:29] &gt;&gt; And he was he was the chief among what?
[2:20:32] THE PUBLICANS.
[2:20:33] &gt;&gt; AND HE WAS POOR.
[2:20:35] &gt;&gt; RICH,
[2:20:40] &gt;&gt; OH,
[2:20:43] &gt;&gt; you start again.
[2:20:44] &gt;&gt; Zakarius.
[2:20:46] &gt;&gt; Hey,
[2:20:47] &gt;&gt; how did you pronounce him? Zakarius.
[2:20:49] Zakius.
[2:20:51] &gt;&gt; Zakius. I want to say good. So, he goes
[2:20:54] in all all around internationally.
[2:20:57] Zakius.
[2:21:02] ZAKIUS WAS RICH.
[2:21:05] &gt;&gt; Very rich.
[2:21:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:21:09] &gt;&gt; Some of you have problem.
[2:21:11] [laughter]
[2:21:14] &gt;&gt; You remember LAST SUNDAY WE FOUND OUT
[2:21:16] THAT JESUS CHRIST, the Bible says that
[2:21:20] for we know the grace of the Lord, our
[2:21:22] Lord JESUS CHRIST, THAT THOUGH HE was
[2:21:24] what?
[2:21:25] &gt;&gt; Rich,
[2:21:25] &gt;&gt; then he became what?
[2:21:27] &gt;&gt; For more. So that we through his poverty
[2:21:29] becomes HOW
[2:21:30] &gt;&gt; RICH.
[2:21:31] &gt;&gt; SO WE FOUND OUT THAT JESUS CONDESCENDED.
[2:21:34] &gt;&gt; You remember that?
[2:21:35] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:21:36] &gt;&gt; HE WAS FIRST RICH.
[2:21:39] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:21:40] &gt;&gt; AND HE CONDESCENDED IN the level of
[2:21:42] poverty.
[2:21:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:21:45] &gt;&gt; And when HE CONDESCENDED, HE MET JOSEPH.
[2:21:49] &gt;&gt; The husband of Mary.
[2:21:51] &gt;&gt; AND JOSEPH MATCHED THE DESCENDING.
[2:21:54] &gt;&gt; And Joseph also was poor. Amen.
[2:21:58] &gt;&gt; BUT ORIGINALLY JESUS IS RICH.
[2:22:01] &gt;&gt; It's right there in the Bible. Say amen
[2:22:03] MY FRIEND.
[2:22:04] &gt;&gt; THEN WE FOUND THAT JESUS WENT THROUGH
[2:22:06] HIS JOURNEY on earth
[2:22:08] &gt;&gt; AND BEFORE HE EXIT THE EARTH
[2:22:10] &gt;&gt; AND GO BACK TO THE FATHER, I CAME FROM
[2:22:13] GOD. I'M GOING BACK TO GOD. GOD, I'M
[2:22:18] GOING BACK TO GOD. WE FOUND THAT JESUS
[2:22:21] DIDN'T WANT TO BE UH IDENTIFIED WITH
[2:22:24] POOR PEOPLE IN THE IN THE GRAVE.
[2:22:30] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[2:22:32] &gt;&gt; IT WAS ISAIAH WHO PROPHESIED
[2:22:34] &gt;&gt; AND MEN OF OLD WERE ANOINTED BY THE HOLY
[2:22:37] GHOST.
[2:22:38] &gt;&gt; THE HOLY GHOST CHOSE A GRAVE OF A RICH
[2:22:41] MAN.
[2:22:46] &gt;&gt; HIS NAME WAS JOSEPH.
[2:22:49] OF
[2:22:50] &gt;&gt; ARAMATIA.
[2:22:52] &gt;&gt; HE WAS A RICH PERSON
[2:22:54] &gt;&gt; AND THE BIBLE SAY HE WAS JUST
[2:22:57] &gt;&gt; I GAVE YOU THE SCRIPTURE LAST TWO WEEKS.
[2:22:59] THE BIBLE SAY HE WAS A JUST AND A GOOD
[2:23:02] MAN.
[2:23:04] &gt;&gt; SO HIS MONEY KEPT HIM
[2:23:05] &gt;&gt; JUST
[2:23:10] &gt;&gt; AND A GOOD MAN. HIS PROSPERITY NEVER
[2:23:14] TOOK HIM AWAY
[2:23:16] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE HE WAS UNDER [screaming]
[2:23:18] PROPHECY.
[2:23:22] [cheering]
[2:23:23] &gt;&gt; I HOPE WE TOGETHER.
[2:23:25] &gt;&gt; I HOPE WE TOGETHER.
[2:23:26] &gt;&gt; SO THE JOURNEY OF JESUS,
[2:23:29] &gt;&gt; are we together? CAME FROM A POOR INTO A
[2:23:33] RICH.
[2:23:34] &gt;&gt; THE RICH WAS BECAUSE HE WAS EXITING THE
[2:23:36] WORLD. NOW HE BECAME RICH RIGHT HERE
[2:23:40] &gt;&gt; AND GOES BACK TO MUCH RICH IN HEAVEN.
[2:23:45] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER?
[2:23:46] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:23:47] &gt;&gt; THE BOOK OF HEBREWS SAYS THIS IN Hebrew
[2:23:50] 2 that we see who
[2:23:52] &gt;&gt; Jesus
[2:23:52] &gt;&gt; who was made what?
[2:23:53] &gt;&gt; A little lower than THE ANGELS
[2:23:55] &gt;&gt; FOR SUFFERING OF WHAT?
[2:23:56] &gt;&gt; OF DEATH.
[2:23:57] &gt;&gt; JESUS became poor.
[2:23:59] &gt;&gt; HE BECAME POOR CROWNED WITH WHAT?
[2:24:01] &gt;&gt; GLORY
[2:24:02] &gt;&gt; AND WHAT
[2:24:02] &gt;&gt; AND HONOR. SO THE POOR JESUS WAS ONLY
[2:24:05] CROWNED WITH GLORY AND HONOR.
[2:24:08] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:24:10] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER?
[2:24:11] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:24:11] &gt;&gt; THAT BY THE GRACE OF GOD uh by the GRACE
[2:24:15] OF THAT HE BY THE GRACE OF GOD SHOULD
[2:24:18] TEST WHAT?
[2:24:19] &gt;&gt; Death for every man.
[2:24:20] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER?
[2:24:21] &gt;&gt; NOW WHEN JESUS ROSE AGAIN AND WENT TO
[2:24:24] HEAVEN IN THE BOOK OF REVELATION 5, THEY
[2:24:28] WERE LOOKING FOR A KINGSMAN REDEEMER.
[2:24:31] &gt;&gt; AMEN. BECAUSE THERE WAS A BOOK
[2:24:34] &gt;&gt; IN THE RIGHT HAND OF THE ONE THAT WAS
[2:24:36] SITTING on the throne.
[2:24:37] &gt;&gt; AND THEY SAY, "WHO IS WORTHY
[2:24:39] &gt;&gt; TO TAKE THE BOOK
[2:24:41] &gt;&gt; AND TO BREAK THE SEALS?"
[2:24:42] &gt;&gt; THERE WAS NO ONE IN HEAVEN. YOU KNOW THE
[2:24:44] STORY.
[2:24:45] &gt;&gt; NO ONE ON THE EARTH.
[2:24:47] &gt;&gt; NO ONE EVEN WHERE
[2:24:48] &gt;&gt; UNDERNEATH THE EARTH.
[2:24:49] &gt;&gt; EVEN IN HELL THERE WAS NOBODY.
[2:24:51] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? AND THEN THEY SAY,
[2:24:53] "BEHOLD [screaming] THE LION."
[2:24:56] &gt;&gt; YES.
[2:24:56] &gt;&gt; OF JUDAH
[2:24:58] &gt;&gt; HAVE PREVAILED. AND WHEN HE CAME UP, HE
[2:25:00] CAME UP AS A LAMB.
[2:25:02] &gt;&gt; HE WAS THE LORD JESUS CHRIST.
[2:25:04] &gt;&gt; HE WAS NOT AN ANIMAL.
[2:25:07] &gt;&gt; HE was a HUMAN BEING.
[2:25:09] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE JOHN WHEN HE SAW JESUS A HUMAN
[2:25:11] BEING, HE SAID, "BEHOLD THE LAMB OF
[2:25:14] GOD."
[2:25:15] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:25:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:25:16] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:25:17] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:25:18] &gt;&gt; SO WHEN JESUS CHRIST PICK UP THE BOOK,
[2:25:21] ALL THE ALL THE PEOPLE, ALL THE ANGEL,
[2:25:24] the 24, EVERYBODY BEGIN to scream.
[2:25:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. They say saying with what?
[2:25:31] &gt;&gt; A loud voice.
[2:25:32] &gt;&gt; What?
[2:25:33] &gt;&gt; WORTHY IS THE LAMB.
[2:25:34] &gt;&gt; WORTHY IS THE LAMB THAT WAS SLAIN.
[2:25:37] &gt;&gt; TO RECEIVE WHAT?
[2:25:39] &gt;&gt; POWER.
[2:25:39] &gt;&gt; IN OTHER WORDS, THE PURPOSE THAT HE WAS
[2:25:42] SLAIN WAS TO RECEIVE WHAT?
[2:25:44] &gt;&gt; POWER.
[2:25:45] &gt;&gt; AND WHAT?
[2:25:46] &gt;&gt; RICHES.
[2:25:48] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[2:25:50] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:25:50] &gt;&gt; SO JESUS WAS SLAIN TO RECEIVE WHAT?
[2:25:53] &gt;&gt; POWER.
[2:25:54] &gt;&gt; AND RECEIVE ALSO WHAT?
[2:25:55] &gt;&gt; RICHES. BECAUSE HE'S GOING [screaming]
[2:25:57] BACK OVER THERE.
[2:25:58] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:25:59] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:26:01] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:26:03] &gt;&gt; AH
[2:26:05] &gt;&gt; TO RECEIVE WHAT?
[2:26:06] &gt;&gt; RICHES.
[2:26:07] &gt;&gt; TO RECEIVE RICHES.
[2:26:09] &gt;&gt; This is in heaven.
[2:26:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:26:11] &gt;&gt; This is in heaven.
[2:26:13] &gt;&gt; In heaven. THIS ALL OF THIS IS IN
[2:26:15] HEAVEN.
[2:26:16] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE HE JUST PICK UP THE book
[2:26:18] &gt;&gt; and everybody screaming that you were
[2:26:21] slain to receive what?
[2:26:23] &gt;&gt; Power.
[2:26:23] &gt;&gt; And to receive what? It means the
[2:26:25] resurrected Jesus have what?
[2:26:27] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[2:26:28] &gt;&gt; He have power.
[2:26:29] &gt;&gt; And he has what?
[2:26:30] &gt;&gt; Riches.
[2:26:31] &gt;&gt; You understand now? And he also have
[2:26:34] what?
[2:26:34] &gt;&gt; Wisdom.
[2:26:35] &gt;&gt; And he also have what?
[2:26:36] &gt;&gt; Strength.
[2:26:36] &gt;&gt; And he also HAVE WHAT?
[2:26:38] &gt;&gt; HE ALSO have what?
[2:26:39] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[2:26:39] &gt;&gt; AND HE ALSO HAVE WHAT?
[2:26:41] &gt;&gt; BLESSINGS.
[2:26:41] &gt;&gt; HE WAS NO LONGER THE JESUS THAT WAS IN
[2:26:44] &gt;&gt; GALILE.
[2:26:47] &gt;&gt; HE WAS A GLORIFIED JESUS.
[2:26:49] &gt;&gt; A JESUS THAT COULD CROSS THE WORLD.
[2:26:53] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. I hope we are together.
[2:26:55] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:26:57] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:26:58] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:26:59] &gt;&gt; SO WE UNDERSTAND NOW THE REASON WHY THIS
[2:27:03] JOSEPH HERE HAVE to be rich.
[2:27:06] &gt;&gt; Oh,
[2:27:08] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER?
[2:27:09] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE JESUS WAS GOING THROUGH HIS
[2:27:11] ORIGINAL FORM.
[2:27:13] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:27:15] &gt;&gt; And if YOU NOTICE, JOSEPH, THE POOR WAS
[2:27:19] AT THE BEGINNING.
[2:27:21] &gt;&gt; That's correct.
[2:27:23] Ah,
[2:27:26] &gt;&gt; can you say amen? No, YOU SLOWING ME
[2:27:29] DOWN. JOSEPH THE POOR WAS AT THE
[2:27:31] BEGINNING
[2:27:32] &gt;&gt; AND JOSEPH THE RICH WAS AT THE END.
[2:27:35] &gt;&gt; Are we together? WHEN JOSEPH THE RICH
[2:27:38] APPEAR, WHAT FOLLOW AFTER WAS THE
[2:27:41] RESURRECTION.
[2:27:43] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:27:46] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:27:48] &gt;&gt; AND WHAT FOLLOW THE RESURRECTION WAS THE
[2:27:51] RAPTURE. AMEN.
[2:27:53] &gt;&gt; THE OLD TESTAMENT SAINT,
[2:27:55] &gt;&gt; rose again, AND WERE TAKEN UP IN the
[2:27:58] rapture.
[2:27:58] &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT.
[2:27:59] &gt;&gt; ONLY WHEN JOSEPH THE RICH WAS RAISED
[2:28:03] APPEAR ON THE SCENE.
[2:28:05] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:28:06] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:28:08] &gt;&gt; AND BROTHER BRANDHAM ALSO HAD A FAMILY.
[2:28:16] &gt;&gt; I'M NOT IN THE MOVE,
[2:28:18] &gt;&gt; BUT WORD MUST BE SPOKEN. IF IT'S IN THE
[2:28:22] COURT, WE MUST READ IT.
[2:28:24] &gt;&gt; BROTHER BRHAM HAS A FAMILY.
[2:28:27] &gt;&gt; AND HIS FIRST SON WAS WHO?

[2:28:33] THE APOSTLE PAUL.
[2:28:35] &gt;&gt; AND THE SECOND CHILD WAS WHO?
[2:28:40] &gt;&gt; WAS WHO?
[2:28:41] &gt;&gt; REBECCA. AND AFTER REBECCA, WHO FOLLOW?
[2:28:44] &gt;&gt; SARAH.
[2:28:45] &gt;&gt; AND AFTER SARAH, WHO FOLLOW?
[2:28:48] WHY DID JOSEPH APPEAR IN THIS END TIME?
[2:29:01] &gt;&gt; I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT YOUR MOVE. I'M
[2:29:03] TALKING ABOUT THE WORD.
[2:29:05] &gt;&gt; BROTHER BRHAM SAYS THIS IN THE MESSAGE,
[2:29:08] SIR. THIS IS THE TIME OF THE END TIME.
[2:29:10] WHEN BROTHER BRHAM SAW THE VISION OF THE
[2:29:13] CONSTELLATION,
[2:29:15] &gt;&gt; JOSEPH WAS THERE.
[2:29:17] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:29:23] &gt;&gt; We need to stop and go home, my friend.
[2:29:26] &gt;&gt; Some of you have a problem.
[2:29:31] &gt;&gt; Do you have a problem with Trump?
[2:29:32] [cheering]
[2:29:33] &gt;&gt; Trump is in the Bible.
[2:29:34] &gt;&gt; There he is.
[2:29:36] [applause]
[2:29:37] &gt;&gt; Come on, brother.

[2:30:17] &gt;&gt; THE RESURRECTION CANNOT COME.
[2:30:24] &gt;&gt; THE RESURRECTION MUST COME WITH A
[2:30:27] GROWNUP [screaming] JOSEPH THAT HAS
[2:30:29] MONEY.
[2:30:33] [cheering]
[2:30:35] &gt;&gt; [laughter]
[2:30:42] &gt;&gt; You will HAVE A HARD TIME, MY FRIEND.
[2:30:45] &gt;&gt; Let me say it again.
[2:30:47] &gt;&gt; Let me say it. Let me say it again. Let
[2:30:50] me say it again,

[2:31:40] &gt;&gt; IN THIS CONSTELLATION.
[2:31:42] &gt;&gt; NO, THAT IS NOT. IN OTHER WORDS, BROTHER
[2:31:44] THOUGHT HE'S GOING TO DIE.
[2:31:47] &gt;&gt; That's right. THAT'S WHAT HE SAID
[2:31:48] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE IT WAS AN EXPLOSION.
[2:31:50] &gt;&gt; BROTHER BRANDHAM SAY I'M GOING TO DIE
[2:31:52] AND GOD SAY HE SAYS NO.
[2:31:56] &gt;&gt; IT WAS NOT FOR YOUR DEATH.
[2:31:57] &gt;&gt; AMEN. HE WAS FOR THE COMING OF THE ANGEL
[2:32:00] AND BROTHER BRANDHAM AND THE LORD SAID
[2:32:02] NO THAT IS NOT. IF HE WOULD HAVE WHAT?
[2:32:04] &gt;&gt; Killed you.
[2:32:05] &gt;&gt; HE WOULD HAVE KILLED WHO?
[2:32:07] &gt;&gt; JOSEPH.
[2:32:07] &gt;&gt; AND HOW COULD HE JOSEPH DOING WHAT?
[2:32:10] &gt;&gt; CALLING ME.
[2:32:11] &gt;&gt; SO WHEN YOU SEE A JOSEPH WITH MONEY
[2:32:17] &gt;&gt; RICH JUST KNOW WE ARE APPROACHING
[2:32:20] SOMETHING.
[2:32:23] &gt;&gt; WHEN MONEY BEGIN TO BE GIVEN TO JOSEPH.
[2:32:28] WE ARE APPROACHING [screaming] THE
[2:32:29] RESURRECTION AND THE RAPTURE.
[2:32:33] &gt;&gt; AMEN. [cheering and applause]
[2:32:35] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:32:37] &gt;&gt; AMEN. IF YOU CAN'T SWALLOW THIS, I WON'T
[2:32:39] I WON'T MOVE.
[2:32:45] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER?
[2:32:47] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE GOD TOLD BROTHER, I WILL GIVE
[2:32:49] YOU A SON.
[2:32:51] &gt;&gt; HIS NAME WILL BE JOSEPH. AND WHEN MA
[2:32:54] WHEN UH MA GOT PREGNANT, HE WAS NOT A
[2:32:57] BOY.
[2:32:58] &gt;&gt; IT WAS A WOMAN THAT CAME UP
[2:33:01] &gt;&gt; AND THEY SAY, "IS THIS JOSEPHINE?"
[2:33:04] &gt;&gt; BROTHER BRANDHAM SAID, "NO, THIS IS
[2:33:06] SARAH."
[2:33:07] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE SARAH IS GENESIS 18,
[2:33:10] &gt;&gt; GENESIS 18. GOD MUST REVEAL HIMSELF IN
[2:33:15] HUMAN FLESH TO SARAH BEFORE JOSEPH
[2:33:18] PERFECTION COMES.
[2:33:24] I HOPE WE ARE TOGETHER. I'M USING A
[2:33:27] DIFFERENT GUN FROM ORLANDO, MY FRIEND.
[2:33:30] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[2:33:31] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER?
[2:33:32] &gt;&gt; ARE YOU NOT SWALLOWING, MY FRIEND?
[2:33:36] &gt;&gt; Are we amen?
[2:33:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. [cheering and applause]
[2:33:41] &gt;&gt; I'M NOT TELLING YOU TO GO BEHIND PEOPLE.
[2:33:43] NO, NO, NO. WE STAY WITH THE WORD.
[2:33:45] &gt;&gt; BUT I'M GIVING YOU INDICATORS
[2:33:48] &gt;&gt; THAT WE ARE GETTING VERY CLOSE.
[2:33:49] [screaming]
[2:33:57] ARE WE TOGETHER?
[2:33:58] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:34:00] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:34:04] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:34:06] &gt;&gt; You will search me for any click in the
[2:34:08] message. I'm none of them.
[2:34:11] &gt;&gt; My click is the message of the hour.
[2:34:16] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:34:17] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? SO WE GO FROM POVERTY
[2:34:20] &gt;&gt; INTO WHAT?
[2:34:22] &gt;&gt; Into rich.
[2:34:24] &gt;&gt; Are we together? IF YOU HAVE A PROBLEM,
[2:34:27] IF YOU NOTICE WHEN JESUS WAS RAISED,
[2:34:30] JESUS ALWAYS ATTRACTED THESE TWO.
[2:34:35] &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT.
[2:34:35] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THE PROBLEM IS WE LEAN TOO MUCH
[2:34:37] ON THE POOR.
[2:34:39] &gt;&gt; AND WE LEFT THE RICH.
[2:34:41] &gt;&gt; OH, JESUS ATTRACTED JOSEPH THE POOR.
[2:34:44] &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. AND JOSEPH THE RICH
[2:34:46] &gt;&gt; EVEN AT HIS BIRTH WHO WAS THE FIRST ONE
[2:34:50] TO MEET Jesus
[2:34:52] &gt;&gt; the what
[2:34:54] &gt;&gt; who saw the baby Jesus
[2:34:56] &gt;&gt; the major never saw the baby
[2:34:59] &gt;&gt; THAT'S A LIE OF CHRISTMAS
[2:35:02] &gt;&gt; SHEPHERD
[2:35:03] &gt;&gt; WHO SAW JESUS THE BABY FIRST
[2:35:06] &gt;&gt; THE SHEPHERD BROTHER SAYS THIS HE SAY

[2:35:20] &gt;&gt; THEY WERE HOW
[2:35:21] &gt;&gt; ILLITERATE SHEPHERD.
[2:35:22] &gt;&gt; THEY WERE POOR AND WHAT?
[2:35:23] &gt;&gt; ILLITERATE SHEPHERD.
[2:35:24] &gt;&gt; THE SHEPHERD WAS THE MOST WHAT?
[2:35:27] &gt;&gt; ILLITERATE OF ANYBODY.
[2:35:28] &gt;&gt; HE DIDN'T KNOW NOTHING BUT JUST ABOUT
[2:35:30] WHAT?
[2:35:31] &gt;&gt; HIS SHEEP.
[2:35:31] &gt;&gt; WHEN HE WAS BORN, THE FIRST PEOPLE THAT
[2:35:34] CAME WERE POOR.
[2:35:39] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together.
[2:35:42] I hope we are together.
[2:35:44] &gt;&gt; AH, YOU WHO LOVE POVERTY, SAY AMEN.
[2:35:47] &gt;&gt; BUT HE DIDN'T STOP RIGHT [screaming]
[2:35:48] THERE.
[2:35:50] &gt;&gt; WHILE HE WAS STILL YOUNGER,
[2:35:52] &gt;&gt; WE SAW ANOTHER GROUP OF PEOPLE
[2:35:55] &gt;&gt; THAT WERE MAJORS. [screaming]

[2:36:11] MEASURES

[2:36:52] THE FIRST ONE WAS DRIVING
[2:36:59] [screaming] AN AUCTION CAR, BUT THE

[2:37:49] &gt;&gt; THE POOR RECEIVED THE VISITATION OF
[2:37:51] ANGEL.
[2:37:53] &gt;&gt; AND THE ANGEL TALKED TO THE POOR
[2:37:55] &gt;&gt; AND THE MAJ DIDN'T RECEIVE THE ANGEL.
[2:37:58] &gt;&gt; THEY HAD THE PILLAR OF FIRE FOR TWO

[2:40:15] &gt;&gt; which he ish.
[2:40:16] &gt;&gt; Yet the greatest thing is being RICH IN
[2:40:18] MERCY.
[2:40:19] &gt;&gt; UHHUH. IF YOU NOTICE IN CORINTHIAN, THE
[2:40:23] BIBLE SAYS THAT HE WAS WHAT?

[2:41:31] &gt;&gt; Supply all your need.
[2:41:33] &gt;&gt; All your needs.
[2:41:34] &gt;&gt; How many needs?
[2:41:35] &gt;&gt; All your need.
[2:41:36] &gt;&gt; SO DO YOU HAVE ANY NEED THAT GOD CANNOT
[2:41:39] SUPPLY?
[2:41:43] &gt;&gt; ACCORDING TO WHAT?
[2:41:44] &gt;&gt; HIS RICHES.
[2:41:45] &gt;&gt; NOT YOUR RICHES. HIS RICHES.
[2:41:48] &gt;&gt; HIS RICHES IN GLORY.
[2:41:49] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY GOD GIVE YOU SOMETHING BEYOND
[2:41:52] WHAT YOU ASK HIM.
[2:41:53] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE HE'S NOT PROVIDING ACCORDING TO
[2:41:55] YOU. BUT ACCORDING TO WHAT HE HAS IN
[2:41:58] MIND FOR YOU.
[2:42:01] [applause and cheering]
[2:42:07] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER?
[2:42:08] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:42:09] &gt;&gt; ZAKAYAS THE RICH MAN.
[2:42:11] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[2:42:12] &gt;&gt; ZAKAYAS THE RICH MAN. YES, SIR.
[2:42:14] &gt;&gt; AND WE ALL KNOW HE WAS A SINNER.
[2:42:17] &gt;&gt; OH MY GOD.
[2:42:18] &gt;&gt; TAKE YOUR TIME, BROTHER.
[2:42:20] &gt;&gt; BUT HE WAS RICH.
[2:42:22] &gt;&gt; TAKE YOUR TIME.
[2:42:23] &gt;&gt; BROTHER STEVEN, YOU SEE HE'S A SINNER.
[2:42:25] HE'S RICH.
[2:42:29] &gt;&gt; Let's go slowly, my friend.
[2:42:32] &gt;&gt; IN THE PARABLE.
[2:42:33] &gt;&gt; CAN I CONTINUE?
[2:42:34] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[2:42:35] &gt;&gt; UH, you are you are getting low, my
[2:42:38] friend.
[2:42:39] &gt;&gt; YOUR BATTERY ARE GETTING LOW.
[2:42:41] &gt;&gt; IN THE PARABLE OF THE RICH young ruler,
[2:42:45] &gt;&gt; when we saw him with Lazarus,
[2:42:47] &gt;&gt; WE FOUND OUT THAT THE RICH young ruler
[2:42:49] was rich.
[2:42:51] &gt;&gt; And Lazarus was the Christian. He was
[2:42:53] poor. That's right. And when he went to
[2:42:55] heaven,
[2:42:56] &gt;&gt; when they ALL DIE, WE FOUND THAT the
[2:42:58] rich went to hell.
[2:43:00] &gt;&gt; But Lazarus went in the
[2:43:02] &gt;&gt; bosom
[2:43:03] &gt;&gt; of Abraham.
[2:43:04] &gt;&gt; SO HE WAS A SON OF ABRAHAM.
[2:43:07] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together.
[2:43:09] &gt;&gt; But we NEED TO KNOW ALSO WHAT IS THE
[2:43:12] ORIGIN OF ZAKAYOS?
[2:43:15] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE ZAKAYAS IS RICH.
[2:43:18] &gt;&gt; SO IS HE GOING TO GO IN HELL OR WHICH
[2:43:20] [screaming] SON IS HE SPIRITUALLY? Here
[2:43:28] you are already slowing me down.

[2:43:38] &gt;&gt; IN THE OTHER PARABLE, THE POOR WAS THE
[2:43:40] ONE THE child of Abraham.
[2:43:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:43:42] &gt;&gt; The rich one in hell.
[2:43:45] &gt;&gt; Ah, you see, brother Stephven, no

[2:45:44] &gt;&gt; MONEY IS A PROBLEM ALSO TO YOU.
[2:45:51] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER?
[2:45:52] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY SOLOMON IN HIS PRAYER
[2:45:55] &gt;&gt; HE SAID DON'T GIVE ME POVERTY
[2:45:59] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE I WILL BE BOUND TO GO STEAL
[2:46:02] &gt;&gt; TO GO TO CROOKED DEALS.
[2:46:09] ARE WE TOGETHER?
[2:46:11] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? SO MONEY IS NOT A
[2:46:13] PROBLEM FOR THE RICH PEOPLE ONLY. IT'S
[2:46:15] ALSO A PROBLEM FOR THOSE WHO WHAT?
[2:46:19] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:46:21] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:46:23] &gt;&gt; Some of you are very quiet.
[2:46:25] &gt;&gt; I'm going to shoot again fire.
[2:46:29] &gt;&gt; I'm going to shoot again fire.
[2:46:32] &gt;&gt; Oh,
[2:46:33] &gt;&gt; you don't want the word.
[2:46:35] &gt;&gt; You don't want the word.
[2:46:37] &gt;&gt; Let me get IT TO YOU.
[2:46:39] BROTHER IS TALKING ABOUT THE RICH YOUNG
[2:46:41] RULER.
[2:46:42] &gt;&gt; He says when did he HAVE IT? WHEN JESUS
[2:46:45] SAYS WHAT?
[2:46:46] &gt;&gt; Follow me.
[2:46:47] &gt;&gt; But he did what?
[2:46:48] &gt;&gt; Turned it down.
[2:46:49] &gt;&gt; He went the way that he could make what?
[2:46:51] &gt;&gt; Money.
[2:46:52] &gt;&gt; He could do what?
[2:46:54] &gt;&gt; Make money.
[2:46:54] &gt;&gt; MAKE MONEY. AND THAT [screaming] IS ALL
[2:46:57] RIGHT.
[2:46:59] &gt;&gt; ALL RIGHT.
[2:47:00] &gt;&gt; I know you won't say amen.
[2:47:02] &gt;&gt; But wait with what is coming.
[2:47:04] &gt;&gt; I know you won't say amen. I already
[2:47:06] know message believer. BUT THIS IS 63
[2:47:10] AFTER the seals.
[2:47:11] &gt;&gt; YOU WILL SAY AMEN.
[2:47:13] &gt;&gt; THAT IS WHAT
[2:47:14] &gt;&gt; ALL RIGHT
[2:47:15] &gt;&gt; NOTHING WRONG WITH MAKING MONEY.
[2:47:20] &gt;&gt; Say amen. [cheering]
[2:47:21] &gt;&gt; Say
[2:47:24] &gt;&gt; amen.
[2:47:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:47:28] &gt;&gt; THIS WAY. SAY AMEN.
[2:47:34] &gt;&gt; Big boss. I'M NOT HEARING YOUR AMEN.
[2:47:37] NOT.
[2:47:38] &gt;&gt; DID I SAY IT?
[2:47:39] &gt;&gt; NO.
[2:47:39] &gt;&gt; DID I SAY IT?
[2:47:40] &gt;&gt; NO.
[2:47:41] &gt;&gt; NOTHING WRONG WITH DOING WHAT?
[2:47:43] &gt;&gt; MAKING MONEY.
[2:47:44] &gt;&gt; BUT FOLLOW JESUS WHILE YOU ARE
[2:47:46] [screaming]
[2:47:47] &gt;&gt; DOING IT. [cheering]
[2:47:55] &gt;&gt; IN OTHER WORDS, IF YOU ARE IN YOUR
[2:47:57] BUSINESS, KEEP GOD FIRST. KEEP THE
[2:48:00] MESSAGE FIRST. KEEP THE WORD FIRST. YOU
[2:48:04] MAKING YOUR TRANSACTION, YOU KEEPING
[2:48:06] GOD. YOU MAKING YOUR TRANSACTION, YOU
[2:48:08] KEEPING GOD. GIVE GOD THE FIRST PLACE.
[2:48:13] [cheering and applause]
[2:48:19] &gt;&gt; Sorry y'all. God has his time to clear
[2:48:23] and free his children.
[2:48:25] &gt;&gt; You shall know the truth
[2:48:27] &gt;&gt; and the truth will set, not me, the
[2:48:30] truth
[2:48:31] &gt;&gt; will set you free. THE WORD THAT I
[2:48:33] SPEAK,
[2:48:35] &gt;&gt; THEY ARE SPIRIT
[2:48:36] &gt;&gt; AND THEY ARE LIFE.
[2:48:38] &gt;&gt; THEY ARE ALSO DELIVERANCE
[2:48:43] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE GOD SENT HIS WORD TO HEAL.
[2:48:48] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:48:50] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER?
[2:48:51] &gt;&gt; SO, ZAKIUS IS A RICH man
[2:48:54] &gt;&gt; and he's poor.
[2:48:56] &gt;&gt; Maybe people has been judging him.
[2:48:59] message believer of that time when they
[2:49:02] pass through Zakius they say sinner
[2:49:06] &gt;&gt; when he's driving his uh when he's
[2:49:09] driving his Mercedes they say these
[2:49:11] things will be burned on fire
[2:49:14] &gt;&gt; the coming of the Lord is coming
[2:49:19] &gt;&gt; are we together
[2:49:21] &gt;&gt; WHEN ZAKUS CHANGE TO A NEW CAR EVERYBODY
[2:49:25] IS UNCOMFORTABLE
[2:49:29] JEALOUSY.
[2:49:31] &gt;&gt; ZAKIUS, THESE ARE WORLDLY THINGS.
[2:49:33] &gt;&gt; BUT BROTHER BRANDHAM GAVE US THE NAME OF
[2:49:36] THE WIFE OF ZAKIUS
[2:49:38] &gt;&gt; AND IT'S NOT WRITTEN IN THE BIBLE.
[2:49:40] [screaming]
[2:49:40] &gt;&gt; IT WAS IN THE THUNDERS.
[2:49:46] &gt;&gt; HER NAME WAS REBECCA.
[2:49:49] ARE YOU THERE?
[2:49:51] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? HER NAME WAS REBECCA.
[2:49:55] SISTER REBECCA IS right there.
[2:49:57] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER?
[2:49:58] &gt;&gt; AND SHE WAS THE ONE PRAYING FOR HER
[2:50:01] HUSBAND,
[2:50:03] &gt;&gt; THE SINNER,
[2:50:04] &gt;&gt; THE [screaming] RICH MAN.
[2:50:08] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER?
[2:50:10] &gt;&gt; REMEMBER THE RICH YOUNG RULER? HIS
[2:50:13] PROBLEM was povert I mean with the POOR
[2:50:16] PEOPLE.
[2:50:17] &gt;&gt; HE DIDN'T WANT TO SHARE WITH THE POOR.
[2:50:19] &gt;&gt; AND JESUS SAY YOUR PROBLEM IS ONLY ONE
[2:50:22] THING. begin to share with the poor.
[2:50:25] &gt;&gt; He didn't listen. SO WHEN LAZARUS THE
[2:50:27] POOR WAS AT THE DOOR, HE COULD NOT GIVE
[2:50:29] HIM SOMETHING TO GET THE BROTHER OUT OF
[2:50:32] TROUBLE.
[2:50:37] &gt;&gt; I HOPE WE ARE TOGETHER. REMEMBER HE
[2:50:40] CALLED ABRAHAM, HE ALSO CALLED ABRAHAM
[2:50:43] FATHER ABRAHAM.
[2:50:44] &gt;&gt; SO BOTH OF THEM WERE CHURCHGOING PEOPLE.
[2:50:49] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together.
[2:50:50] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. AMEN.
[2:50:52] &gt;&gt; BUT LET'S SEE BROTHER SINNER ZAKOS.
[2:50:56] &gt;&gt; WHEN you ask message be have you seen
[2:50:58] sister Zak brother Zakus Zakius
[2:51:02] they say pray for sister Rebecca.
[2:51:06] Oh dear pray for sister Rebecca. Her
[2:51:09] husband
[2:51:11] is a sinner.
[2:51:13] &gt;&gt; We see sister Rebecca cannot even enjoy
[2:51:16] her car because people are saying it's
[2:51:18] sinful stuff.
[2:51:21] She want to get a ube.
[2:51:26] &gt;&gt; Oh, have I said something wrong? Can I
[2:51:28] continue with Zakus?
[2:51:31] &gt;&gt; We got to stop somewhere. I can't preach
[2:51:32] the parable. I can't get to the 10
[2:51:35] pound. Let's get to Zakarius. And verse
[2:51:38] three, AND HE SOUGHT TO SEE WHO
[2:51:40] &gt;&gt; Jesus
[2:51:41] &gt;&gt; who he was and could not for THE WATER
[2:51:44] &gt;&gt; DEPRESS. WHY IS A sinner
[2:51:49] &gt;&gt; wanting to see Jesus?
[2:51:51] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:51:52] &gt;&gt; WHAT HAPPENED TO ZAKAYAS?
[2:51:54] &gt;&gt; ZAK HEARD.
[2:51:55] &gt;&gt; THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT.
[2:51:56] &gt;&gt; SO MUCH ABOUT JESUS
[2:51:58] &gt;&gt; BUT NEVER SAW JESUS.
[2:52:01] &gt;&gt; ALL FAITH.
[2:52:04] &gt;&gt; COMETH BY WHAT?
[2:52:07] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:52:07] &gt;&gt; I hope we ARE TOGETHER.
[2:52:09] &gt;&gt; AMEN. SO SOMETHING PRICK THE SINNER
[2:52:12] [applause]
[2:52:14] &gt;&gt; THAT WAS JUDGED BY MESSAGE
[2:52:16] &gt;&gt; BELIEVER.
[2:52:20] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:52:21] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:52:22] &gt;&gt; AND THEY S SAY LET ME SEE THIS JESUS
[2:52:24] they talking about.
[2:52:27] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:52:28] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE OF THE PRAYER OF SISTER REBECCA.
[2:52:31] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:52:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. Zakayas search the Bible SAY AND
[2:52:35] HE COULD NOT FOR the water the press
[2:52:38] which is the crowd BECAUSE HE WAS A WHAT
[2:52:41] &gt;&gt; little stature
[2:52:43] &gt;&gt; so the height is not a problem
[2:52:46] &gt;&gt; are we together
[2:52:48] &gt;&gt; SO ZAKIUS TRIED TO SEE JESUS THE CROWD
[2:52:51] EVERYBODY'S TALL THE BROTHER is the
[2:52:54] sinner is trying
[2:52:59] &gt;&gt; he jump ON THE CHAIR AH
[2:53:02] WHAT IS IN YOU
[2:53:04] &gt;&gt; THAT WANT TO SEE GOD?
[2:53:09] &gt;&gt; WHAT IS IN YOU
[2:53:10] &gt;&gt; THAT WANT TO SEE JESUS?
[2:53:13] &gt;&gt; WHAT IS IN YOU THAT IS MAKING EVERY
[2:53:16] EFFORT
[2:53:17] &gt;&gt; TO SEE GOD?
[2:53:21] &gt;&gt; AND PEOPLE ARE CALLING YOU SINNERS.
[2:53:25] &gt;&gt; PEOPLE ARE CALLING YOU FANATICS.
[2:53:29] [applause]
[2:53:29] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:53:31] Let's see, brother Zak what he did.
[2:53:34] &gt;&gt; Verse four. And he did what?
[2:53:36] &gt;&gt; Ran before.
[2:53:37] &gt;&gt; And did what?
[2:53:38] &gt;&gt; Climbed up into a sycamore tree.
[2:53:40] &gt;&gt; A sycamore tree. Let's leave it alone.
[2:53:42] To see him for he was what?
[2:53:45] &gt;&gt; To pass down.
[2:53:45] &gt;&gt; IN OTHER WORDS, ZAKAYAS LOOK HE SAID
[2:53:48] WHICH DIRECTION is he going?
[2:53:51] &gt;&gt; Oh, he said he's going down 74.
[2:53:54] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[2:53:54] &gt;&gt; Zak say okay the crowd is here. I'm too
[2:53:58] short. I try everything I can't. He ran
[2:54:00] on the other side by the gas station
[2:54:02] over there and went there by the gas
[2:54:04] station. He looked here. God provided a
[2:54:08] sycamore tree.
[2:54:13] &gt;&gt; THE ONE WHO WAS PLANTING THE SYCAMORE
[2:54:16] DIDN'T KNOW the reason WHY HE PLANT. HE
[2:54:18] THOUGHT HE WAS PLANTING A TREE.
[2:54:21] &gt;&gt; HE DIDN'T KNOW GOD WAS PUTTING SOMETHING
[2:54:24] TO HELP ZAKOS. IN OTHER WORDS, WHEN YOU
[2:54:27] A CHILD OF GOD, GOD WILL EVEN PLANT A
[2:54:30] TREE
[2:54:30] &gt;&gt; TO BRING YOU TO HIM.
[2:54:39] &gt;&gt; You didn't get ME WHERE. GOD WILL DO
[2:54:42] EVERYTHING
[2:54:43] &gt;&gt; to make sure HE GETS YOU BACK TO HIM.
[2:54:47] [cheering]
[2:54:51] [applause]
[2:54:53] FOR THAT DAY THE SYCAMORE TREE WAS NOT A
[2:54:56] TREE.
[2:54:56] &gt;&gt; It become a lad.
[2:55:01] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:55:02] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:55:04] &gt;&gt; Now look at a rich man.
[2:55:07] &gt;&gt; Follow me very carefully. A rich man
[2:55:10] begin to climb A TREE.
[2:55:12] &gt;&gt; HE FORGOT HE HAD MONEY.
[2:55:17] &gt;&gt; HIS MONEY BEFORE JESUS WAS NOT A
[2:55:19] PROBLEM. IF HE NEED TO CLIMB A TREE FOR
[2:55:22] JESUS, HE WILL CLIMB A TREE.
[2:55:25] &gt;&gt; THAT'S THE [screaming] RICH MAN OF GOD.
[2:55:28] [cheering]
[2:55:29] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together.
[2:55:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:55:31] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together.
[2:55:32] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:55:33] &gt;&gt; BROTHER ZAKOS CLIMBED THE TREE AND SAT
[2:55:36] DOWN. He says, "Now I'm going to at
[2:55:38] least see him
[2:55:40] &gt;&gt; how he's coming."
[2:55:41] &gt;&gt; He sat right there.
[2:55:44] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:55:45] &gt;&gt; Are we together? He didn't know the
[2:55:48] aspiration that was coming from him
[2:55:50] &gt;&gt; was coming from the maker.
[2:55:53] &gt;&gt; The maker was working with him.
[2:55:56] &gt;&gt; In other words, it was not his
[2:55:58] intelligence.
[2:55:59] &gt;&gt; IT WAS GOD THAT TOLD HIM, "I'M going to
[2:56:02] pass there. GO CLIMB ON A TREE. I WILL
[2:56:06] MEET YOU THERE."
[2:56:07] &gt;&gt; IT WAS ZAKAYAS AND AND
[2:56:09] &gt;&gt; IT WAS ZAKAYAS GOD
[2:56:12] &gt;&gt; AND JESUS GOD THAT WERE TALKING.
[2:56:18] NOT THIS IS A CHAOS.
[2:56:20] &gt;&gt; THERE'S A CHAOS INSIDE.
[2:56:23] &gt;&gt; THAT ONE SYNCHRONIZED WITH GOD.
[2:56:25] &gt;&gt; IN OTHER WORDS, WHEN GOD IS COMING, THAT
[2:56:27] ONE IS SAYING,
[2:56:30] "Are we together?
[2:56:31] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:56:33] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER?"
[2:56:35] &gt;&gt; JOB TO verse uh five. AND WHEN JESUS
[2:56:38] CAME WHERE
[2:56:39] &gt;&gt; TO THE PLACE
[2:56:41] &gt;&gt; HE DID WHAT?
[2:56:42] &gt;&gt; He looked up.
[2:56:43] &gt;&gt; How did Jesus know somebody was there?
[2:56:47] Huh?
[2:56:48] &gt;&gt; JESUS WAS GOING. EVERYBODY was going and
[2:56:50] they heard Jesus.
[2:56:55] &gt;&gt; He looked up. In other words, I know you
[2:56:59] &gt;&gt; when you were looking for me there. I
[2:57:01] already seen you.
[2:57:03] &gt;&gt; I ALREADY KNEW YOU BEFORE YOU EVEN KNEW
[2:57:06] ME.
[2:57:11] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:57:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:57:12] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER?
[2:57:13] &gt;&gt; AMEN. NOW, WHO WAS LOOKING UP?
[2:57:16] &gt;&gt; JESUS.
[2:57:17] &gt;&gt; WHO WAS SUPPOSED TO LOOK UP?
[2:57:20] &gt;&gt; NOW, who's looking up?
[2:57:22] &gt;&gt; JESUS.
[2:57:25] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[2:57:26] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:57:28] &gt;&gt; AND HE LOOKED UP AND SAW HIM AND SAID TO
[2:57:30] HIM, "WHAT?"
[2:57:31] &gt;&gt; ZAKAYAS.
[2:57:32] &gt;&gt; How did he know his name?
[2:57:36] &gt;&gt; I'm almost finishing because I know I
[2:57:39] can't touch the parable of the No, I
[2:57:40] can't touch the parable of the temper.
[2:57:42] We got to get We need to find a
[2:57:44] different uh subject to this. Amen. HE
[2:57:47] SAYS, "AND ZAKARIUS, make what?"
[2:57:49] &gt;&gt; Haste.
[2:57:50] &gt;&gt; In other words, hurry
[2:57:51] &gt;&gt; and do what?
[2:57:52] &gt;&gt; And come down
[2:57:53] &gt;&gt; for when?
[2:57:54] &gt;&gt; Today
[2:57:55] &gt;&gt; I must do what?
[2:57:56] &gt;&gt; Abide at thy house.
[2:58:00] &gt;&gt; So something when Jesus saw Zakayos
[2:58:03] &gt;&gt; and he saw what was in Zakayas,
[2:58:07] &gt;&gt; he say change the direction.
[2:58:10] &gt;&gt; We got to go this way.
[2:58:12] Zak, this is not about you seeing me.
[2:58:15] I'm coming to your house.
[2:58:18] &gt;&gt; The house of a rich man.
[2:58:23] &gt;&gt; Not Mcdana.
[2:58:26] &gt;&gt; The house of a rich man.
[2:58:28] &gt;&gt; A rich man that is sinner.
[2:58:32] &gt;&gt; Can I continue?
[2:58:34] &gt;&gt; Can I continue?
[2:58:36] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THE PHARISEE CRITICIZED JESUS.
[2:58:39] &gt;&gt; They say, "You see where he's going?"
[2:58:40] Right.
[2:58:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:58:42] &gt;&gt; Can I continue?
[2:58:44] &gt;&gt; Can I continue?
[2:58:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:58:45] &gt;&gt; And he did what?
[2:58:47] &gt;&gt; Made haste.
[2:58:47] &gt;&gt; Made haste and did what?
[2:58:49] &gt;&gt; He came down
[2:58:49] &gt;&gt; and receive him how
[2:58:50] &gt;&gt; joyfully.
[2:58:52] &gt;&gt; How can he receive Jesus joyful? What
[2:58:55] was in Zakayas the sinner?
[2:58:58] &gt;&gt; THAT WHEN JESUS IS COMING, ZAK is like,
[2:59:01] "Hallelujah.
[2:59:03] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God.
[2:59:05] &gt;&gt; AMEN. [screaming]

[2:59:38] &gt;&gt; AMEN.

[2:59:44] &gt;&gt; MESSAGE BELIEVER OF THAT TIME, THEY DID
[2:59:46] WHAT?
[2:59:46] &gt;&gt; THEY ALL MURMURED.
[2:59:47] &gt;&gt; THE MURMUR SAID THAT HE WAS GONE TO BE

[2:59:51] &gt;&gt; GUESS
[2:59:52] &gt;&gt; WITH A MAN THAT IS WHAT?
[2:59:54] &gt;&gt; A SINNER.
[2:59:57] &gt;&gt; A sinner.
[2:59:58] &gt;&gt; Let's see what happened. VERSE EIGHT.
[3:00:01] AND ZAKAYAS DID WHAT?
[3:00:03] &gt;&gt; STOOD.
[3:00:03] &gt;&gt; AND SAY WHAT? unto the Lord.
[3:00:05] &gt;&gt; PUSH THE BRAKE, MY FRIEND. WHO PREACHED
[3:00:08] TO ZAKAYOS?
[3:00:11] &gt;&gt; I'm I'm I'm about to stop because we
[3:00:14] have not started the parable.
[3:00:16] &gt;&gt; Who stop who preached Zakos?
[3:00:20] &gt;&gt; Who preach him?
[3:00:22] &gt;&gt; So where is he coming from with this?
[3:00:25] &gt;&gt; AND LISTEN TO WHAT IS coming from the
[3:00:27] mouth of Zakayas.
[3:00:29] &gt;&gt; Zakius without any sermon.
[3:00:34] Can I continue?
[3:00:36] &gt;&gt; Zako says, "LORD, WHAT?"
[3:00:40] &gt;&gt; BEHOLD.
[3:00:41] &gt;&gt; BEHOLD, LORD, WHAT?
[3:00:43] &gt;&gt; The half of MY GOODS.
[3:00:45] &gt;&gt; THE HALF of my money.
[3:00:47] &gt;&gt; THAT'S CORRECT.
[3:00:48] &gt;&gt; I GIVE IT TO WHO?
[3:00:50] &gt;&gt; THE POOR.
[3:00:52] &gt;&gt; I GIVE IT TO WHO?
[3:00:53] &gt;&gt; THE POOR.
[3:00:54] &gt;&gt; WHO INSTRUCT HIM TO GIVE TO THE POOR?
[3:01:02] THE rich young ruler Jesus told him give
[3:01:06] it to the poor.
[3:01:07] &gt;&gt; He gave him instruction. He was unable
[3:01:10] to RECEIVE IT. BUT ZAKUS NOBODY AS SOON
[3:01:14] AS JESUS ENTER IN HIS HOUSE that was it.
[3:01:18] &gt;&gt; Revelation [clears throat] begin to
[3:01:19] come.
[3:01:22] THE PRESENCE OF JESUS BEGIN TO BRING
[3:01:25] REVELATION.

[3:01:32] JESUS

[3:01:37] &gt;&gt; a sinner calling him Lord. HE SAID LORD
[3:01:40] I'M GOING TO GET half of my money.
[3:01:43] &gt;&gt; Not all the money half of it
[3:01:45] &gt;&gt; and I'm going to give it to who?
[3:01:47] &gt;&gt; The poor.
[3:01:48] &gt;&gt; Why the poor? Thank you, Lord.
[3:01:50] &gt;&gt; I'm going to do what the rich young
[3:01:52] ruler was able to do.
[3:01:55] &gt;&gt; I'm going to give it to the poor. And
[3:01:57] when you give it to the poor, you are
[3:02:00] having treasure?
[3:02:01] &gt;&gt; In heaven.
[3:02:02] &gt;&gt; SO, ZAKAYOS MUST COME from where?
[3:02:04] &gt;&gt; Heaven.
[3:02:09] &gt;&gt; ZAKOS MUST COME FROM WHERE?
[3:02:11] &gt;&gt; HEAVEN.
[3:02:12] &gt;&gt; UH-HUH. And he says, I'm going to give
[3:02:14] it to the poor. AND IF I HAVE TAKEN WHO
[3:02:17] TAUGHT HIM REPENTANCE AND RESTORATION.
[3:02:20] IF I HAVE TAKEN WHAT
[3:02:21] &gt;&gt; anything
[3:02:22] &gt;&gt; from what?
[3:02:23] &gt;&gt; Any man
[3:02:24] &gt;&gt; by what?
[3:02:24] &gt;&gt; False accusation.
[3:02:26] &gt;&gt; I WILL RESTORE WHAT
[3:02:27] &gt;&gt; HIM FOURFOLD.
[3:02:28] &gt;&gt; THIS IS WHAT CAME OUT from the mouth of
[3:02:30] David.
[3:02:32] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[3:02:32] &gt;&gt; I WILL REPAY FOUR. WHO TAUGHT HIM ALL OF
[3:02:35] THIS?
[3:02:37] &gt;&gt; WHO PREACHED TO HIM?
[3:02:40] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[3:02:40] &gt;&gt; The rich man.
[3:02:42] &gt;&gt; Can I continue? I'm going to FINISH MY
[3:02:45] FRIEND. AND JESUS SAID TO HIM
[3:02:48] &gt;&gt; THIS DAY
[3:02:50] &gt;&gt; IS WHAT?
[3:02:51] &gt;&gt; SALVATION.
[3:02:52] &gt;&gt; COME WHERE?
[3:02:53] &gt;&gt; TO THIS HOUSE.
[3:02:55] &gt;&gt; FOR AS MUCH ALSO AS he
[3:02:59] &gt;&gt; he is what?
[3:03:00] &gt;&gt; A SON OF ABRAHAM.
[3:03:02] &gt;&gt; ZAKAYOS [screaming] WAS A WHAT?
[3:03:03] &gt;&gt; A SON OF ABRAHAM.
[3:03:05] &gt;&gt; YOU DON'T GET THAT CORRECTLY.
[3:03:07] &gt;&gt; BY FLESH. ZAKAYOS WAS A JEW.
[3:03:11] HE WAS ALREADY A SON OF ABRAHAM.
[3:03:14] &gt;&gt; BUT THE SON OF ABRAHAM, JESUS IS SAYING
[3:03:16] HERE, IS NOT THE FLESH SON OF ABRAHAM.
[3:03:19] &gt;&gt; HE'S SAYING ZAKAYAS
[3:03:23] &gt;&gt; IS FROM [screaming] THE ORIGIN OF
[3:03:25] ABRAHAM.
[3:03:28] &gt;&gt; IT'S THE PEOPLE THAT [screaming] ARE
[3:03:29] BORN WITH FAITH.
[3:03:36] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER?
[3:03:37] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? SO IF ZAKAYOS DIED, you
[3:03:41] will see him in paradise with Lazarus.
[3:03:46] &gt;&gt; Lazarus the poor and Zakayos the RICH
[3:03:50] MAN. AND BROTHER BRANDHAM PREACH

[3:04:02] &gt;&gt; AMEN.

[3:05:37] Because we can't call this this one.
[3:05:39] Amen.
[3:05:41] &gt;&gt; We can't call and we have not touched
[3:05:42] even Moses
[3:05:44] &gt;&gt; to know why was his face
[3:05:46] &gt;&gt; shining and he have to put a veil.
[3:05:49] &gt;&gt; We need to pick that up and put them
[3:05:52] together by the grace of God. Amen.
[3:05:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:05:55] &gt;&gt; The word of God are spirit. Yes.
[3:05:58] &gt;&gt; And his word are life.
[3:06:00] &gt;&gt; Your God is a mighty God.
[3:06:02] &gt;&gt; He's a rich man. He's a Boaz.
[3:06:05] &gt;&gt; He became poor so that through your his
[3:06:08] poverty, you can become what?
[3:06:11] &gt;&gt; He came from Joseph the poor all the way
[3:06:13] to Joseph and then goes back again.
[3:06:16] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[3:06:18] &gt;&gt; Are we together? And when you see a
[3:06:20] Joseph that is appearing again in this
[3:06:22] end time and getting money, just know we

[3:06:44] &gt;&gt; Because when we will get to Joseph

[3:07:09] This is it right here. We will pick up.
[3:07:11] Let's pray. Heavenly Father, Lord, we
[3:07:14] are approaching you again humbly this
[3:07:16] afternoon. Father, thanking you for your

[3:07:35] so things that our mind could not even
[3:07:38] imagine because we know that we are in
[3:07:40] the presence of the living God.

[3:07:46] A God that save to the uttermost. A God
[3:07:49] that will never leave one of his
[3:07:51] children. He will redeem every single
[3:07:54] redemptive attribute back to him so that
[3:07:57] one day we can all be together in the
[3:08:00] family of heaven. Father, many things
[3:08:02] has been spoken, but I pray Lord that

[3:08:07] water this sermon. And Lord, Father, as
