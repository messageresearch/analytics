on sunday uh we don't want to forget about that so i believe that's this sunday that they'll be collecting it right okay so this sunday there'll be a building fun collection god bless you church i'm extremely nervous but um it's something that's been resonating with my heart the last couple of services um when brother kelly got up to preach on a wednesday he said you know to the devil we don't have time to play anymore and there's been things and people i've been praying for for deliverance and i just feel like the tests have been coming from every direction you know when soldiers go in to fight they always have a song well this is my song and this is my war song and the lord has been putting it on my heart for the last two weeks so just i hope you enjoy it um but okay it says um i got joy in my soul god is in control i got satan on my trails but i'm singing all this well he's attacking every day but i'm watching while i pray no matter the attack i won't turn back cause this means war [Music] this means war i got joy in my soul god is in control like i stayed in on my trail [Music] but i'm watching while i pray no matter the attack i won't turn back [Music] he's attacking every

have a special that she mentioned before she came in i didn't know what she said and it's i plead the blood i see i see a pattern i see the lord saying something here thank you sister that was good brother seth did you have a song a man if if we could observe my wife was out of service for i think the past two weeks or something [Music] she was admitted at the hospital amen but we thank the god tonight that um she's here in service and she's healed we want to give praise to the lord amen amen i i want to sing this song amen when she came back from the hospital she was like the lord has placed in their heart for us to pray and invite the presence of the lord amen so that night we went on our niche to pray amen and then she was asking for this peace amen so after prayers amen the lord just answered her prayer amen we just want to give glory to the lord amen amen so i i'm not very familiar with this song but i'm going to try lord help me amen [Music] he's here hallelujah [Music] i

amen amen brother sex can you keep playing that can you keep playing that and i'm going to have him sing it one more time as we call the mister up this evening but i feel led to say this and if i'm out of order please forgive me but i feel led to say this church if we listen to these words just standing there i was i was reading them up there and truly he is here he's in our presence right here right now brother brahm talked about the sixth dimension just being just outside of what we could see and one day we'll step into it church if you can catch the realization that he is here in our presence i think this song would mean something more to you if you need something this evening he is here i wonder if you can stand with me this evening as brother seth sings this one more time as we call our brother i want you to just enter in with me i want you to raise your hands close your eyes and just feel him in your presence feel him listen closely hear him calling out your name you can touch him this evening by faith you can touch him he is here so as brother seth sings us one more time i want us to enter in with everything in us sing as loud as you can close your eyes raise your hands give him your best this evening [Music] oh hallelujah we believe you're here lord we want to give you our best lord we want to reach out and touch you this evening come down dwell with us this evening or we want more of you this evening we want more of your holy spirit we ask that you come by our way lord as you make your rounds up and down each aisle this evening lord lord as the sister wrote do not pass me by lord that's our prayer this evening don't let your holy spirit pass us by but lord as you make your rounds born lord we want you to just touch us this evening lord to give us a refilling of your holy spirit lord we want more of you this evening we want more of you one more time as our brother comes this evening he is here [Music] is [Music] [Applause] his name again [Music] leave out your [Music] you can touch you you will live [Music] hallelujah do you believe it tonight do you believe that you can touch him and never be the same right amen how many believe that hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord amen praise be the name of the lord wonderful worship wonderful singing sister keller the devil can destroy your faith he cannot the bible say that whatsoever is born of god overcometh the world and this is the victory that overcometh the world even our that's a right there amen amen praise be to the name of the lord sounds like everybody is ready for the sermon did you dig into the fine curtain again amen did you meditate and chew over it chew over it chew over it and the holy spirit unfolded more and more and more and more amen you need to understand those that curtain first because on sunday we is soaring again amen they're calling up for snow not a big snow you already got your big snow you were happy so not a big snow it's uh either two inches or something on uh friday probably the evening till like uh midnight or something like that so it's a little bit questioning about the house meeting on saturday whether we're going to have it or not or we need to push it i know sunday by god's grace if the lord don't tarry we will have service so don't get the snow from friday to run away from service on sunday amen we have service on sunday morning amen it's not a big snow then it's questionable so we will monitor the weather again tomorrow lord's willing and we will send out the text to confirm whether we're going to keep the house meeting or we need to reschedule it i know you got question i got two beautiful questions today somebody sent it to me and i could not hold it i have to answer them and then i ask a letter is this for saturday they say yes and i already answered them amen so we will see if we have a meeting on saturday and the lord allowed more time then we can repeat those questions so somebody else can benefit the problem with question and answer we don't record them so if you miss it those that online if you miss it you miss it amen so it's better to do everything that you can if you can make it to be there because we don't record them we don't want to record people asking questions it's not a little bit good to put them on the public amen so just remember that if you have other questions please feel free to send it a little bit quicker maybe by friday if i can have everything so it gives me a little bit of time to go ahead it's difficult to bring a question on saturday morning or at three o'clock then i'm already prepared for five six seven questions amen so the sooner you send those questions the better by god's grace one of them was about the two souls which is a very very very good subject and i can see the holy spirit moving because the person who has that almost was entering in the sunday sermon so we will get deeper sooner if you can i know i know the devil is gonna fight you to stay away from church don't do that amen we're trying to help you amen if you got your birthday on sunday this on sunday this on sunday please try to postpone those stuff let's get serious with god amen because as soon as you you mentioned something like this before you know it why were you not on sunday this happened there just a little bit something somebody is already out some even run away when they know i'm preaching so they know that the fire is coming up so don't run away it's a different story to listen to the sermon at home versus to be in the church so that's the reason why i'm insisting to be in the church because of the anointing that is there except if you absolutely have to stay home then god who sees your heart will open a special channel for you so you can benefit for it but if you're taking that for granted to stay at home then god is judging you by your heart you're not going to receive it if you were in service and you get it then you go home you listen at home that's a different story the anointing was still working so i'm not saying you can't get anything from the channel but if you can make it to church make sure you're in church amen so be gracious because we're gonna rock your boat very hard i'm sorry i'm just warning you it's gonna shake you like you've never been shaken um we're not trying to kill you we're not trying to de-christianize you we're just opening this thing so you can see where you are these things has been confused for years in the message i know what i'm talking about whether people have the holy ghost or whether they don't have it amen how do you receive it did i receive it because this happened to me because i felt warm because i felt this this a lot of questions amen so if if you feel like your boat has been rock remember i don't live with you i'm not living in your house so if you hear something pulling up from your house you need to be spiritually mature enough to understand that it's not me the high priest is zeroed in things and pulling them up amen so don't run away you who are not here tonight do not run away come on sunday amen let's rock the boat for a month and move it left and right left and right left and right amen it's deep i know praise god everything will be all right by god's grace you might be seated because i don't want to hold you too long amen so remember tomorrow be on the lookout for the for the uh for the s the text and then we'll let you know about it question and answer if you have them please by friday morning that would be better so i have enough time to go look it up the sisters meeting we have not uh come up with a date yet i was looking at her question this morning and i look at one i thought he was a chicken nugget but he was not the word of god is food it's spiritual food in due season so when i say delicious it's tsunami i'm talking about the word of god amen test god when they took the book john ate the book it was sweet so it's our food amen it is delicious not to this one the inner man hey man that's where you get it amen so i thought it was something really on the surface when i tried to put my hand there but robert i found myself in the ocean amen and it's getting into marriage pure so i'm still debating and praying whether i need to answer that to the sisters meeting or he's going to be pure to the marriage and when i dig on brother branham things begin to unfold to unfold to unfold and scripture begin to come up never seen it before and here they come up today this morning but they begin to unfold so you pray for me i will talk to the deacon and see brother branham used to handle that separately but the problem we have if you don't understand the background which brother branham called the back part mind of god the message will be legalistic did you get it in other good words if i just tell you stop wearing high heel it's a legalistic that's why we have to teach where is high heel in the scripture where he's in in a message why is brother branham against it then you will understand that high heel give you a shape different than what god gave you and that shape is a shape to provoke somebody and to lust that's why hallelujah is wrong once you understand the concept then you know it's wrong it's going to come off if it doesn't come off then i'm dealing with a stubborn spirit right there of unbelief that we need to keep praying and then break that through amen so that's the reason why those things i'm thinking if i can get if i have to open them up i cannot record that it's going to be if i recorded it's going to be only for the church because by the bratham didn't want to handle it publicly and if you open it somebody will grab it and if they're not spiritually minded they can put all kind of excuses to move that direction i want people that's going to be here that's going to listen that knows where they where where where is the intent of god about it then when you open up the seed especially those that are married younger one because sometimes you call people the order will come and the youngest i have problem have all kind of excused work and all kind of stuff and that's where the problem is amen i'm talking as a pastor so you pray for me i will see if i answer that to the sister it might be to a certain extent i have to stop because it's purely into marriage amen blessed be the name of the lord we already talked to you about the building fund this sunday we have the election of the church officer remember that in prayer so the lord will guide you he we gave an announcement two or three weeks ago it was mute on youtube if you missed the announcement that was given because of the church officer you talk to the deacon they will let you know what is going on amen blessed be the name of the lord i believe that's all i have if you have time continue to listen to hidden life that will help you up here in life one hidden life with christ or hidden life in christ if you finish them all three you tell me then i tell you why so many people cannot leave what is the title again why are so many people tossed about and then where did the pentecost affair then the third one so we're going to take all those sermons and put them together and then you see how they're going to come up amen so let's stand now let's sing only believe home we believe only believe as we call brother killing all things are possible only believe only believe [Music] only believe all things are possible [Music] lord i believe it's a lord i believe me [Music] hallelujah [Music] hallelujah give the lord a clap up hallelujah it's a blessing to be back home again huh we've been doing some traveling by the grace of god but we thank the lord for each and every one of your prayers and this to you and brother or that brother michael his wife's back good to see you amen god bless you and all that's here tonight god foreseen it before the foundation of the world who was going to be here tonight so we come to give him the praises give him the on and give him the glory that's all the music musicians thank you so all hearts and minds are clear we know it's wednesday so we're going to get into the word let us pray lord god we thank you for your grace your mercy lord jesus we thank you lord god for an opportunity lord jesus to come before these precious bride of yours father we thank you for each and every soul that's been laboring in prayer for us as we've been traveling along the dangerous highways father so we give you praise we give you on and we give you glory and father remember those that had a desire to be here remember those that are streaming oh god that couldn't make it so lord god we come to lift you up on high and father will we come lord god recognizing that only you can bring the understanding and the revelation of your word father that you want your precious children to hear tonight father so we come now bind in every force every demon spirit that will try to come against your precious children father so they may leave here energized so may you leave here refilled lord god because we promised lord god to lift you up and give you the praise you said if i if i be lifted up from the earth i'll draw all men unto me so we give you praise and honor and by faith we claim it all done in jesus name we pray amen and amen you know why you're standing two passages the scriptures here let's go to acts 1 verse 8 amen but you shall receive power after that the holy ghost has come see the lord been telling us the holy ghost is already there is that right because he put the seed there before the foundation of the world we just want the spirit to come down and water it is that right huh because we can't do nothing it's not by power it's not by might but it's by my spirit say to the lord huh driving these intellectual demons out of here in this age he says that the holy ghost has come unto you and ye shall be witnesses unto me both in jerusalem and into judea and to sumeria and to the uttermost part of the earth so all the part of the earth now let's go to hebrews 10. we don't know which way we're going to go because i'll tell you i didn't have much time but that's okay we'll read the text and he'll bring the contents is that right you just pull for him you know what you come looking for tonight you know what you need tonight i'm sure looking for mine is that right hallelujah i got no use for the devil was that right it's no good time for us to come up here hebrew 10 and verse 5. you have it say amen wherefore when he cometh into the world he said sacrifice and offering thou what is not but thou offering thou what is not but a body has thou prepared me may the lord had a blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated so we come here on tonight the thought that was on on on my heart it was just preparation you know preparation you know i had a chance to look at there and they were just touching my heart from sunday the lord ritually blessed is that right oh my god and when i saw those thorns on his head huh when god brought them thorns huh you know the devil he's got to understand what god is doing in this hour here now what the lord is doing in this hour here right now now he's unfolding every hidden manner is that right see something you have to understand you got you have to realize you're already in the veil you're in the holiness of holy you got to go look at the god unveiling when you go look in that message i know i won't have time to get in that but if you go in that message to show you you're already in the veil is that right you're already in the holiness of holy god came and he showed us that it's so simple but it's going over their heads is that right but it's only for the true believer that's always for the true believer you see so when you're recognizing his hour here now what god never does nothing without preparing something first is that right that's why we said preparation when you're now he's preparing it when we come at you when you came here tonight you had to get yourself ready you had to prepare when you hit the children for school you have to prepare when you go to work you have to prepare so when we come in there you know you always have to prepare we just don't go into a battle without first preparing is that right but the beauty thing about it with us is that that's why the holy spirit say stay in neutral but when god prepares something is that right when god prepared something he prepared us for this age saints and just pray with me tonight we didn't plan to be long but we want to show you what god is preparing in that old testament he had types he's bringing it up to now he's bringing us he's prepared us to be achievers he prepared us to be overcomers he prepared us see man always want to try to do things himself is that right even there in the garden or even oh look at adam and eve they the only one who had god actually talking to them brother benjamin god was talking to them in the garden god had prepared everything for him they didn't have to do anything but what speak the word is that right but now for us this is the manifestation time it's not just the word it's the manifestation of the word is that right that's why he says what a light cannot be hidden in his hour in that no no no no no you can't put it up under the bush no no no no no no no no this is the manifestation now of christ himself that's why he says in time past god has spoke to us in diverse time he spoke to the prophet he said now he's speaking through his son jesus christ is that right they were the prophets of god is that right now jesus became what god became the prophet under the spirit under the anointing of christ back on the scene again is that right now we're in appearing ready appearing i'll tell you huh hallelujah we love the appearing the appearing is the unfolding of the word is that right god made a stage when we was there in the old temple old tabernacle is that right when the tabernacle that was made with hands god did not act never did one of them dwelt in the tabernacle made with him is that right he always destroyed it i don't want to get ahead of myself preparation man always trying to prepare something for himself we're going to show you his two spirits that's supposed to be moving in this time right now brother branham talked about it is that right see you have to understand now stay away from them demons religious demon fussing with a religious demon is that right they ain't got time to fuss with religious demons we're looking for you on a mission we're looking for that last soul we're looking for that last seed god is doing too much for us right now it's like five being shut up in my bones we're gonna desire your prayers doors are open in here doors are open in there we have to realize things god is only opening because we're about to get out of here it's not much longer the signs of the time is showing us the times that we're living in is that right we know that they don't know what to do themselves hallelujah preparation let's see what rather brandon said about preparation he said now preparation god before he does anything he always prepared now you're the offspring of god i know that you have to prepare is that right you have to prepare the things when you look to come to church wednesday sunday i know you prepared something happens when you're late uh oh i'm not saying you didn't prepare but i'm believing you still prepared to come to church to be on time is that right now i'm not saying some work they have situations in their life the lord knows everything is that right behold the eyes of the lord see the good and the evil so we're talking about preparation we're talking about god even tell our minister you got to go off and get quiet for a while and you have to go up and get quiet for a while then you got to get with him and then it's a preparation before you come before his children so we're talking about god always prepare his children let me read it so you can understand see where we're going preparation he says it's spoken in the bible he said before we go to go go over to fight a war you have to prepare preparation before before you come to church you may what say it again preparation so that means we shouldn't be late if you're making preparation because why because when god give us order for preparation now the gifts are there inside of you everything is being restored so god is teaching us is that right how to prepare and get ready you come 30 minutes early what and get prepared is that right so god your father can what use them is that right if god want to use you if you guys do we have to understand you understand your positions in the musicians and things is that right you're sent out first the gifted ones are sent out first now today i think it's second chronicles five and go look it up they send it out first then they send them out first now the musicians is getting ready why is that right sometimes i had my ups and downs times when there was no run around god came and spoke these words to me praises do what confuse the enemy is that right even when you're struggling even when you're down even when you're hurting even when you're financing you can give you rejoice why because god has prepared his way for you by his promised word you've never seen my seat forsaken or the righteous for begging for bad god has prepared a way for us preparation we're going to come up here tonight we're talking about he's preparing us to move us into a what a position let me get ahead of you he get around in there look what he said let me read this here first so you can catch fish here preparation the active process of making ready for something done to get ready for use of consideration he said now he said equipping with all things necessary huh all the benefits is in god the lord said have the ocean out there if it's the ocean if you take on elijah if you take a big ocean if you take a spoon right or say a cup and you take that cup and you dip it out of the ocean is that right the same ingredients that's in the cup is the same out of the ocean that big old ocean the same holy spirit that was there in our father now dwells inside of us is that right he said what house can you build me preparation don't you love the message of the hour the devil can't touch this message because it's the resurrected christ back on the scene again hallelujah look what he said preparation thank you jesus he said now and god has always god has always prepared his people for an event that's just about to happen so that means see if the devil can't pull nothing over our eyes he's for knowledge he was because he know all things is that right so he could be in all places he could prepare us if god set the preparation no weapons formed against you shall prosper us is that right because god is preparing it god is setting the raid god is plaguing the battle is that right the father was not ours the battle belongs to the lord is that right hallelujah [Music] thank you he said look he said now then i stop right here just a minute i believe the people are in preparation of the last great destruction he says he says i believe we're at the end you can speak to people he said no matter what he said they are in the spirit of the last days now look how he showed us when we know by prophecy he said they are in the spirit of the last day and god cannot send destruction before

religious side this was going on in his hour this is what we're warring against these religious demons that's out here even some sitting up in the message think they've been and they know it before he also said you can learn the message but you have to understand the holy ghost has been taking us wide into the interval that annabelle was telling you now it's got to be a living life a true believer is catching a hold of it it's a live life it's a manifestation of the word now it's not just you just knowing it here here's what brother brandon was talking about right here yeah i know we ain't pushing the devil tonight i've been waiting for these days too look what he said he says now he said for men shall be lovers of their own selves covenants boasters proud blasphemies disobedience to parents unthankful humber the same unthankful whoa that's a rough demon too he said now unholy without natural affection truth figures false accusers incontinence fierce despisers of those that are what huh you want to know that that's why they happen when they got over there with joshua when brother branham said they came out off of mountain transfiguration when he said they was casting out devils in thy name his healing is sick in thy name you know where he got it from he got it from when they were 70 was anointed is that right when those 70 was anointed joshua came to him and it was telling them to is that right we're prophesizing joshua said why are thy envious huh you're running through there you see where you got it from he said they had them jealous demons why are you despisers of those that are good is that right breathe preparation be thankful how god made you is that right if you're a mother be the best mother there is your son be the best son there is everybody can't be a preacher is that right you're a musician be the best position there is you're a preacher you're the best preacher there is is that right you're the best wife there is you're the best child there is you're the best mother there is why why because god prepared you is that right everyone is put here for different purposes for different reasons be the best that you are is that right let god

then you won't come to church then when you backed it up against the wall the first person you call on help me lord hallelujah i don't know why we're going this way but this is having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof from such turn away ah now he's coming he's unfolding now he's moving it to the baptism of the holy ghost son he done justified you he sanctified you he'll fill you with the holy ghost but that's not with the whole purpose is that right the whole purpose was to move you into royalty is that right you are royal blood that you are the royal priesthood you are peculiar people from the peculiar country you come from god you go back to god uh stand on the word uh you are bold we could go boldly to the throne of god not only for our self but for our family for our loved ones for our neighbors you are the children of the royal most high. [Music] this was not a religion this is becoming a life this is a life though the real believer they seen in manifest this is the life this is the life we've been waiting on [Music] he said you got a believer you got a make-believer and an unbeliever you see the non-belief as soon as you say something they don't like they don't come back but that make believer he or she just hangs around they just hangs around and hangs around is that right hallelujah but sooner or later the folly shall be made known you can't hide from this holy ghost huh this is the true holy ghost back on the scene [Music] separation preparation he says he having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof denying the holy ghost he said for of this sort are they which creep into houses and lead captive silly women laden with sin laid away with diverse luck see wrongful thinking wrongful desires the conversation is there first of all you we know you're wrong anyway because what you doing up in that girl's face anyway what you doing up in that sister's face anyway what you doing around there those women's faces anyway what you standing up in there anyway don't you know the policeman is watching you you got deacons around here watching you is that right you got to be pulling alongside privately you will be pulled alongside probably is that right come down here hello yeah why because that's dude that's my sister is that right ain't that what he said you will marry your sister is that right you will marry your brother because the scripture said so god has prepared that for you hallelujah he said look ever learning and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth see that unbelief is down there in the soul it can't get out of he says now as james and jamboree withstood who moses so do these also resist the what the truth is men of corrupt minds reprobate concerning the faith they come in there that means what it is james and jamie reed come and perform the same thing that moses was performing but what they did you was operating on the sorcery they were operating under witchcraft they was underrated under religion in the way of witchcraft now this and is our here now but god has sent what when moses came on the scene he was the anointed word is that right when brother brown came there on the scene he was the anointed messenger 48 he was the pastor for the whole world at that time malachi 4 he came to turn the hearts of the children of the father hearts of the fathers of the children unless i come and smite the earth with a curse is that right he came with a message and the messenger is that right they cannot be separated in his hour here now hallelujah i don't want to say it and say it i went to a place this sunday and said huh is it all right to say brother branham's name yeah i said well boy open the door we was on fire then you got something out there i'm telling you they don't want to hear it then the religious demons let me leave that alone he said now look he said now he said but they shall proceed what no further for their father shall be manifest unto whom all men as theirs also was they're not james and jeremy he's telling us see you there you had that witchcraft but now he's saying we're willing again what's sorcery sorceries all types of witchcraft it comes in a way satan is sitting there waiting to see what comes out of your mouth is that right he's recognizing if you understand if you don't understand so we have to understand follow the instructions of the lord the preparation god has prepared for you and i is that right he says but they shall but thou has fully known my what doctrine manner of life purpose faith long suffering charity patience persecutions affliction which came in and to me at idiot at icona at leicester he said what persecution i endure but out of them all what ah preparation he's preparing his brother do you have to go through some trials and tribulations is that right tribulation is working patience patience work experience experience work is hope is that right hello who in here no longer what those desires of the world right huh we don't want the desires of the world right so what the holy ghost told us he told us under the inspiration when the pastor was ministered the holy ghost is there is that right is convict you he was saying paul said the things i desire to do i did not the things i desired not to do i did but it was a war going on in my mind is that right among my members what the world was going on in his spirit and his spirit was now war with that flesh because he was feeding his man deadly the black dog was being pushed out pushed out pushed down the holy ghost was there that's why we said you have to understand when you are now we are all born of what one spirit is that right but what you have to do is cast down every imagination that exhort itself against the lord is that right and ask god how that devil come in you have to know you everyone know the wickedness and the business you know yourself still with me it's just like this is flu season i know for a fact i gotta keep my back warm because if i don't keep my back warm that's how he comes in do you understand and so now the first time you got sick or something came upon your flesh now you pray you say lord he came upon me ignorantly lord i don't know but lord what do i have to keep warm keep your feet warm keep your head warm keep your back warm this is flu season you have to know what you have to do to keep that devil off of you is that right [Music] it's what he says you got to realize huh and naturally they tell you to get on there they well let me see this you need to get on some natural things just like garlic a devil won't come six inches of a garlic is that right huh huh you don't let me do no garlic huh yeah there ain't no garlic garlic can cure a lot of things i'm telling you castor oil too and i'm trying to tell you these things you got to understand these natural things for your body is that right you got to realize those things don't you get close to somebody because they ain't going to come near you neither that garlic on you let me tell you something now look he said look you gotta understand what the lord is trying to bring you into in this hour here now here's a certain thing you have to realize that we have to fight we're in a war we're wrestling out against flesh and blood but against principalities and powers wickedness and rulers in high places those sicknesses is of the devil those are demons they were there that's why he was saying over the world some you go to some places i see why brother brown said you don't go out he didn't go out preaching adoption i was in one place preaching adoption one fellows thought i was telling him don't pray for people don't lay hands on people no i wasn't saying that we were just moving you up hither is that right you're moving up it hit them for this age that's all you he was saying brother branham still pray for people because he understood where they was at he understand that the compassion that was given unto them through him he understood those things but he was still trying to do what trying to get us to a point where you just received the word is that right you receive the word of god so that's why he said when an unclean spirit comes out of a man and he walks out of that man now you're looking for a place to go where is he looking for a place to go from somebody that got religion now you got religion you got justification sanctification he talks about what that spiritual realm that's what deceives so many people because they got that's getting that spiritual realm and they get clean but they never receive that word that's going to steal them whatever they trouble with is going to sell them he said grieve not the holy spirit of god for which by you are sealed until the day of the redemption so you have to understand when you look into the message and somehow when you come into preparation don't let the devil try to get you to sleep don't let the devil try to put you pressure on the pulpit because he know the word that you receive is going to set you free and now that's the message for the hour and so when it comes and that message they're coming you realize the lord is trying to bring something to you is that right god then god rich in mercy did not curse adam he cursed the ground is that right now that's why he said everything at the cross at the cross where i first saw the light and the burdens of my heart rode away it was there by faith i received my sight and now we're happy all today see why because now he did what took the curse off of the ground is that right my my my my my my my mind don't you know that the earth is moaning and groaning for all the manifestation of the sons and daughters of the most high god [Music] look what he says now look at our time isn't that right the manifestation supposed to be on our time turn to mark 16. hallelujah you don't have to be afraid of no devil no devil he said now look we're dealing with that they had to deal with that unbelief hallelujah in verse 16 14 he said afterwards he did what appeared on 2 11 as they sat and meet and upgraded their with their what unbelief and their what hardness of heart because they believed not them which had seen him after he was risen he said and he said unto them go into all the world and preach the gospel to what every creature now he's telling you he took them in and brought them he's taught us you're being taught here and what you're being taught here now you reply with that gospel when you go out there you're teaching and preaching but the gospel just doesn't come in letter only it comes in power and demonstration is that right he said now look it says he that believeth in his baptized shall be what saved but he that believeth not shall be damned all and these signs shall follow them that believe in my what name they shall cast out devils they shall speak with new tongues they shall take up servants and and they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall do what recover now we both have the signs and wonders and following us also that's the true church that's the elect church when we got down there went to florida i said we're going to some souls is going to be saved when we went down here to florida and we went down down there to florida and i mean the lord just ambushed those demons now when he ambushed those demons what those people would be in trouble with but those that was truly struggling those that truly heard the lord the word of the lord when we asked those that want to turn their life over to the lord we had some turn their life over to the lord so these signs shall follow them that what that believer and we read this so you have to understand the footsteps of the righteousness order of the lord well i just didn't go just to be going you have to realize the minister of the gospel when he go he want to make sure god is with him that's what he wanted to be sure we were supposed to have there a meeting and after we had the meeting we were supposed to be here and the lord did what changed it to the 29th is that right it changed it to the 29th he gave me grace that was my sign to what you're able to go go ahead on that mission we have to realize many are out there hallelujah that's our saints you warned against those religious demons but you got power inside of you greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world what is he preparing you for he prepared you he said but i prepared a body for me is that right you're getting the word out of the holiness of holy that's what you're getting tell you what turn to first kings uh five help me lord hallelujah first kings five and we won't read at all i just wanted to show you how this is coming out of here with that uh let's look at verse 1 1-5 and he says uh he says in hiran the king of tyra sent his servants unto solomon for he had heard that they had anointed him king in the room of his father and hyran was was ever a lover of david he says and solomon sent to him and saying thou knowest how that david my father could not build a house into the name of the lord his god for the wars were about him on every side until the lord put them under the soles of his feet he said but now the lord my god have given me what rest on what every side i got peace on every side they did not wait until they didn't wait sooner they heard solomon was king is that right they started moving into it he said that there is neither adversary nor evil occur he says and behold i what purpose to build and house unto the name of the lord my god as the lord spake unto david my father saying thy son and i will set upon thy throne in thy room and he shall build what a house unto my name prepare preparation still with me he had to prepare for preparation there solomon was drop down over here to chapter six now solomon is building this temple look over there to verse 7 6-7 he says in the house when it was when it was building was built of a stone made ready before it was bought hither so that there was neither hammering or action or tool or iron or heard in the house while it was what in the building look up here to verse 5 that's 115. he says in the walls of the house he built see prepared chambers around about against the walls of the house round about both of the temple and of the what the oracle and he made chambers round about the oracle was it the we were set built up for the holiness of holy that's where the ark was sitting at you got to go over there into the unveiling of god and brother brandon worked through i'll tell you he worked that mighty in there the long message but he was showing you how you're in the holiness of holy because of what by one what spirit are we all baptized when you are we're at in christ you are a new creature in christ jesus you are eating the holiness of the holy you are eating a hidden manner now that's why god is unfolding these things because you didn't stop with justification you didn't stop with sanctification you were wrong with the baptism of the holy ghost but then he moved us into what the adoption is that right that's what he was always trying to get us to from the whole time to the adoption why because now we are in the holy ghost to finish this work you are in co-workers with god you are now being manifested you are the light though over there he said in the beginning the beginning was the word he said the word said what let there be one light is that right but the word was no longer just word now in the word it was what light you are now the light the light is drying you taking the word inside of you you are becoming the manifestation of the lord jesus christ son is that right a peculiar people they're looking at the way you dress up and looking at the way you talk guns they're looking at you they say there's something different about these people you have the royal blood saints you don't have to be looking to try to look like the world is that right he said i beseech you brother by the way mercies of god but be not conformed to this world but be transformed is that right for by the way by the renewing of your mind by the renewing of your spirit now in that spirit the holy spirit is now working on that inner man now he's going to leave and guide you see some just get there they got to they they got memory reasoning conscious affection those things they're moving in that spirit man and they think they're all right but god wants you to move down into the holiness of holy for you to live into the holiness of holy that's why you hear the pastor say are you up here have you caught up with the message when they was getting ready to go out of egypt when they was getting ready to leave out mo brother branham said he told him y'all got to keep up now you had to keep the message what was being unfold for that time because the death of angels is about to strike is that right when the death angel was about to strike him are you first born you ought to be rejoicing you ought to be shouting you ought to be praising the lord why because your father and your mother chose the rugged way is that right for that firstborn we always say if the firstborn is right i'm telling you you can get the rest of them in line but we have to understand the order of god what god has prepared for you and i is that right my my my my mind preparation preparation he said now look what he got he said the oracle in verse five drop down there but look why some of them don't get it look what he told solomon he said now verse 11. look at verse 11 and the word of the lord came to solomon saying concerning this house which thou art in building if thou will walk in my wife statues and execute my judgments and keep my commandments to walk in them then will i perform my what my word with thee which i spake unto david thy father he got around in there now god telling you you've walked in it you got it you've been justified you've never did it you've got to change your way of thinking is that right you never did it no matter what what can wash away my sins nothing but the blood of jesus the blood today is the bloody word the water that being washed on the word now we have to understand god in his hour here now is preparing you he's preparing you for this great battle now you've been justified you've been sanctified you're filling with the holy ghost now he all instructed you pray read your bible get out there be a witness be a light for the kingdom of god keep it in order obey the word of the lord god is bringing you behind the veil he's brought you behind the veil now let's stay behind the veil that's all he's trying to keep you to do you're making it look like it's hard you're making him think it's difficult you're already behind the veil [Music] [Applause] we just waiting to get out of here hallelujah he said now look solomon came hallelujah help me lord he said now look when they come there we talked about earlier about that virtuous woman let's turn to proverbs 31 thank you jesus he said he get over there he said now look some people get around in when you look at those characteristics of that virtuous woman and you go look it up the virtuous it makes you think he's talking about a man who makes you think he's talking about a man because those characteristics about her she's got strength she's got might she's efficiency she's spiritual wealth inside of her huh she's got a she's got ability she's a force why is she that force because that man is the head that's why the holy spirit is zoomed in here on sunday morning he's trying to tell you she's only doing it it's just like the poor when it came to moses when they came to moses but i was gonna kill moses moses got so busy about that business then it got so busy the battle was supposed to do the sapporo when it circumcised the child because you got them circumcised the child um brother branham said maybe that's why god put both of them together both of them had a temper the holy ghost is trying to warn you if you don't get yourself in line now you're going to get yourself in trouble you got to understand moses got himself in trouble when he got down there he came down off the mountain when he got there off the mountain his temper got him in trouble when he got over there in egypt that's how he came out of the land he killed the egyptians buried him in a saying his temper got him in trouble when he came there out of the mountain that devil came to moses got moses he knew he had a temper moses slander god just gave him grace brother steve just gave the christians just gave the saints grace moses pleaded for him granted him grace and he come moses see him come down worship in the cast and idols that temper got him in trouble yeah he slammed the ten commandments down got him in trouble he got to understand but god prepared a way for you and i the same devil came to jesus after 40 days and 40 nights he came to jesus but he came to the wrong one this time [Applause] he was hungry he probably saw the stone the man should not live by bread alone but by every word proceeded to follow the mouth of god the word there was nothing in him he passed 40 days 40 nights and the word came out of them if you say what the problem say keep your head in the world ah nothing's going to come out but the word give them a clap off and say [Applause] he said look the word of god is back on the scene say you know he can't touch you no diseases no sickness no nothing should come upon you just speak the word you speak that word with faith that demon will run god said submit yourself to the word of god then then the devil will run free from you take the message of your hour preparation god prepares her words to get us ready for this hour god is not playing hallelujah look
