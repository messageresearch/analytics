leadership guidance and wisdom in the precious name of jesus christ father god you remove all sins and trespasses out of the way and we'll give you all the glory in the wonderful name of jesus christ we pray that church say amen amen if you have your bibles amen let's go to uh acts the ninth chapter acts chapter nine and then we're gonna go to romans chapter nine praise the lord and we're very familiar with the story this is where paul was converted amen he had he had an old testament experience with god but god wanted to show paul this is a season of change hallelujah listen church uh let's start at verse um let's start at verse 11. the bible says and the lord said unto him arise and go into the street which is called straight and inquire of the house of judas for the one called saul and of saul of tarsus for behold he prayed and have seen in a vision a man named ananias coming in and putting his hand on him that he might receive his sight hallelujah paul was already waiting on ananias but listen listen he said the enemy is answered lord i have heard by many of this man how much evil have done done to the saints at jerusalem and here he has authority from the chief priests to bind all that call on thy name but the lord said unto him go thy way for he is a chosen vessel unto me and he's the chosen of us unto me to bear my name before the gentiles and kings and the children of israel for i will show him how great things he must suffer for my name's sake amen let's go to romans chapter nine romans chapter nine and just to make the reading short let's start at verse 11. my it's so refreshing to hear bible's turning amen praise the lord glory romans 9-11 the bible says for the children being not yet born neither having done any good or evil that the purpose of god according to election might stand not of works but of him that call it it was said unto her the elder shall serve the younger as it is written jacob have i love but esau have i hated oh my may the lord bless you of his word you can have your seats praise the lord tonight i want to use for a subject uh god's path of life for you god's path of life for you amen now i want us to just just i want to lift your spirits tonight hallelujah because we're called to walk by faith and not by sight but there's too often certain things happen in our life and we step back to walk by sight hallelujah no i want to say to you tonight god is in control he's in control of the good days he's in control of the bad things he's in control when you're happy he's in control when you're sad hallelujah he's in control when you got plenty he's in control when you got lacked see god has a purpose for your life hallelujah and it's time for us to realize that there is nothing out of order there's nothing out of order no matter what it looks like there's nothing out of order no matter where your children are there's nothing out of order no matter how the church condition might look there's nothing out of order no matter what it took to get you here there's nothing at all hallelujah god has a plan for your life and he wants us to find that path walk in that path and live victorious because when we find the path that god has ordained for us satan can't do nothing you become untouchable when you find the path that god has ordained for you before the foundation of the world there's nothing that you can do to stop it hallelujah there's nothing he can say there's nothing he can set up when you find the plan of god when you find the path that god has put you in no matter what the obstacles are you will overcome [Music] because if it's god's plan if it's god's path who gonna stop god from making it come to pass hallelujah listen church we go back and we look at the story paul hallelujah he was a man with an old testament revelation but then god hallelujah wanted to show paul that now it's a season for change hallelujah and i think sometimes hallelujah when we go through a change we misunderstand what god is doing he's not hurting us but he's making us stronger he's bringing us into a greater place in the kingdom he's bringing us into something we would have never got to if that didn't happen so i want you to go back look at your life and look at something that you didn't like that had to happen to get you here hallelujah amen so you know church paul was persecuting the church he had orders he was going back and forth he saw people get stoned all these things so power had a reputation and his reputation exceeded him church let me tell you something god allowed that reputation to get out there god allowed paul's reputation to get out there so certain people would treat him a certain way those people that treated paul a certain way they were ordained they were put in his path honey there were people that had the whipped paw there was a viper that had the bike paw there were people that had the stone power there was a boat that had to break up on fire there was a gripper there were festus there were people who tried to stop paul but all those people were in his path god put them there why to keep paul on track whoa god put struggle in your way to keep you on track god allow paul to have bad eyes to keep him on track [Music] my family brother kelly's sister kelly they know it took a brain tumor to get me here so the devil don't get no credit that brain tumor was what god used hardly to bring forth a season of change in my life god used a sickness to bring up a revelation of healing wow that revelation was already in there cancer was in my path [Music] and god used cancer to bring out healing now you ask yourself what is he putting in your path church the thing about god when we go through things it's not for us to backside but it's it's to encourage us it's to show us what god has placed in us for that certain situation you look in the scripture hallelujah mostly everybody that was chosen of god they went through things unexpectedly and the prophet preached the message and he said god hallelujah moving at an unexpected time in an unexpected way hallelujah god ordains things hallelujah just to help you grow hallelujah but sometimes hell yeah brother stephen when we're going through a change we start complaining no why are you allowed this no why do you allow all those things to happen at that old church so you can get here see church there's a bigger picture hallelujah see hallelujah if i can see if i can make it plain y'all know me i don't like being around the bush if i can make it plain there was a pastoral gift inside there was a pastoral gift so god had to stir up some things god had to make somebody believe in something else just to get him in his position and he says my sheep know my voice so god began to speak by another voice because you were the only sheep that could follow that voice if you would have stayed listening to the other voice you would have died because you were not connected to that gift you're connected to this gift hallelujah look look and let's not get it twisted nothing against them nothing against him but god used him for my season of change [Music] [Applause] so i thank god for him being what god made him to be jesus had to be judas higher so that jesus could be crucified hallelujah now who gonna say jesus wasn't used of god [Music] see god is a great orchestrator god knew that there were other gifts lying here so god had to stir the pot because somebody else was supposed to some lead somebody else was supposed to play somebody else was supposed to be a deacon somebody else was supposed to be a trustee somebody else was supposed to sing somebody else was supposed to pray so what god did god allowed a season to change to come what happened he was putting us in the path of our purpose i ain't gonna be long now i don't have no punch lines you pull i preach hallelujah you quit pulling i stop you resist i sniff hallelujah that's how it works church this gift belongs to you [Music] hallelujah church but if we can look at paul paul now he's entering into a season of change what happened in his change he got knocked off a horse first and i know founder of that horse probably hurt but that hurt was for his good not only did he fall off the horse and get hurt he also got blind in his season of change everybody else walking around when they sight paul in order to see more god he had to get blinded first [Applause] he had to get hurt he had to get blinded then he said who art thou lord see church in your hurt hallelujah in your pain you ought to say god what are you doing church satan can't touch you unless god allows it [Music] but look god i love god he's working on both ends paul hallelujah in his heart the gift of god was still working in his life because the scripture says paul had already had a vision of ananias coming to see him i wonder when you get hurt is your gift still working or do you tell brother brother stephen i ain't coming to church gas price is too high god let that gas go up to test your faith no i ain't searching for cheap gas i'm gonna take what i got put up to the pump and expect god to be god he said as long as i break to his storehouse first he said see if i won't open the windows of heaven that's a promise but in a season of change we riding around looking for cheap gas we're looking for a cheap way out no god is bringing you higher you know what we do we say something that we say ah man these guys get up to five dollars i ain't paying no five dollars you know what you do be right up there every time it go up you'll be right at that pump you know why because god will put you in position where you ain't got no choice all you can do is believe hallelujah and that's what he did to paul he put paul in a position where his change was coming and he couldn't stop it nobody could stop it the people he was running we couldn't stop it his teacher gamalia couldn't stop it the sadducees and pharisees couldn't stop it it was his season of change and when your season of change come your job can't stop it your family can't stop it your church family can't stop it church the scripture says now this is what i want you to understand we sing a song what god has for me is for me hallelujah church and there ananias is going back and forth with god about not wanting to go lay hands on him but ananias was a part of god's vision whether he like it or not and whether they like it or not we are a part of malachi 4's vision [Applause] whether they like it or not we got thus had the law whether they like it or not we will come into perfect faith we will come into perfect love we will come into a divine healing we will take a rapture [Music] god already showed it to malachi he already showed it to him and you can't stop a vision that god gave from coming to pass no matter what kind of friction you got no matter what your status is in the church now ananias was a big shot in god's church he was a man used of god but you know what he couldn't stop the vision pertaining to paul tonight he's going back and forth he's going back and forth with god saying god and he tells all the bad about paul isn't that just like the devil he want to tell all your man he want to tell what you did what kind of movies you watching what you doing on facebook and ig and twitter all these things but whether you doing that or not if the gene seed of god is in you hallelujah facebook ain't gonna stop it from coming forward iga gonna stop it from coming for twitter ain't gonna stop it drugs ain't gonna stop it alcohol ain't gonna stop it r b music ain't gonna stop it cardi b ain't gonna stop it we all say ain't gonna stop it and i love to make the real religious people mad because brother killer when i was in the club doing my thing i had to see the god inside of me whether you like it or not i was born with it and tupac couldn't stop it biggie couldn't stop it he did it couldn't stop it and i'll tell you right now the migos can't stop your skin the baby the baby love baby or whoever else baby can't stop it from coming forward [Music] hallelujah when i was a young guy one of the saints saw me at the gas station dancing to some worldly music and they went back and told my mom they said we saw your boy he had to have the music on all these things my mama say sister i ain't looking at that my mom was a sister i ain't looking at that i believe he's a gene of god and i ain't gonna stop praying to what god has envisioned me to see over his life comes to pass now all i got to say is look at me now church we are living by vision church in the night say no god i can't go down to this man and got orders he ain't got papers he didn't kill some people god said he's a chosen vessel oh hallelujah no matter what you think about me it can't change god's mind [Applause] no matter what you saw me do no matter what you heard if god got something for me your criticism can't stop it now i'm not making excuses for sin but what i'm saying is harley when paul's season came no matter how many people had already walked with god they couldn't stop paul from having his chance why because it was what god had to say about the matter it wasn't what the brothers or sisters had to say about the matter it was what god had to say about the matter and usually what you think about somebody ain't what god think about somebody [Applause] because entertainer said he's a murderer he does he that he throws stones and he got papers and all these things and god said he's a chosen vessel and then he says i'm going to show him how great things he must suffer for my namesake so suffering is a part of your change hallelujah because remember brother branham said i preached what paul preached holy so if we preach what paul preached there's a measure of suffering connected to that journey and it's the suffering that helps us grow it's the suffering that helps us mature it's the suffering that gets us to the next level at church finally in the night goes down there he lay hands on paul and paul receives his sight why why does he receive his sight because he will say the lord [Music] ananias was in paul's path of life and paul's path of life was the path that god ordained for him so what we need to do is be obedient hallelujah to the path god has chosen for us because when you get in that path you become invincible [Music] hallelujah listen i want everybody to catch it tonight holly hey it's time for us a rapture's about to take place it's time for us to stop walking around with our hands down i don't know about y'all but i'm looking for a body change church the vision the prophet had of united states with craters could happen any moment russia has a dictator in office a crazy man hallelujah who ain't afraid to flex his power who said he won't wake up tomorrow and say i'm sick of all this but before he do that we'll be go [Applause] change in the moment of the twinkling of an eye why because god chants hope there's a vision of you and i beyond the curtain of time already gone there's a word spoken that the bride will not see tribulation so let him push the button i'll be changed in a moment of the twinkling of an eye [Music] [Applause] listen church this is what the prophet of god says he says i want you to catch this now we're not just holding up space in the building we're not just gathering on a wednesday and a sunday no we're living out god's thoughts we're in the mind of god church listen he says your birth here was pre-planned now my mama name is anora my daddy name is james but according to the word of god they had nothing to do with it [Music] god put them together because i had to come from him earlier i had to be here tonight so god pre-planted before the foundation of the world you know he looked at her she looked at him and they said oh you cute that was god doing it my daddy looked at my mama and said i like chocolate that was god doing that why cause i had to come forth wow so you know you hear people say they tell their children you was a mistake not me i was no mistake i was in the mind of god before the foundation of the world and whether mama or daddy tried to quit with three children god said no you have four because there's one more you got to have and you gonna name him cadre [Applause] and cadre is french for a leader of men even gave me a name to identify my calling oh my church she said your birth here was pre-planned i guess you believe that [Applause] every one of you knows that our birth was pre-planned did you know that your your being here never originated just at a myth or a thought the hospital in columbia had nothing to do with this the doctor that was there hallelujah to proceed to birth had nothing to do with this it was all god hallelujah pre-planned by god he said he said everything was all pre-planned by god before the foundation of the world that you would be here so let's step out of a space of time and say god ordained everything so i like be here in this moment [Music] church what we're looking at right now look around the room as you look around the room what are we looking at god's plan we're looking at god's plan if you're here in church tonight you're not here by coincidence you are here god you are here because god plans you to be here oh my listen he says the infinite god knowed and to be infinite he had to know every fleet that would ever be in the earth [Music] that's a powerful god god knows every fleet that exists in the earth and you think he don't know what you're going through knows this he says and oh my not only does he knows how many they are he says and how many times it bats his eyes now we're not talking about a buddha or allah or confucius or lebron james no we're talking about jesus christ we're talking about the god of gods the lord of lords the one who we serve is omnipotent in power he's omniscient he's omnipresent and the public god said because he's all-knowing makes him everywhere [Music] god knows what you gonna do before you do it god knows when your season has come for you to change [Applause] hallelujah thank he said that's infinite see you are little our little minds cannot fathom the infinite that what infinite means the infinite god he knowed all things therefore there is nothing out of cater [Music] anybody going through something tonight if you're going through something you're right in god's plan hallelujah you're right in god's plan he got you right right right where he wants you to be see church sometimes the season of change comes and you have to give up certain things you know god gave a promise to abraham and he told abraham your seed is gonna be like the stars you know cedar's going to be like the sand and your seed shall possess the gate of the enemy and abraham didn't know hallelujah that he was going to have to fight for his life sometimes hallelujah he was going to have to fight for the lukewarm believer called lot lot was put there why hallelujah a lot was put there hallelujah so the prayers of the righteous could prevail [Applause] [Music] see god has given us an example hallelujah amen god wants to show us what it means harley to pray for somebody who's not given their all to pray for somebody that you love hallelujah who's not giving they all and your prayers will prevail and save that person's life the bible says the sins of sodom vexed lots righteous soul what made lot righteous abraham's prayers hallelujah because lot wasn't even living for god so what made him righteous abraham's prayers going up before god interceding for everything that was going on down in sodom god showed us through him what it means hallelujah to prevail in prayer [Music] hallelujah church and if we just go on down a little bit and we look at that seed and in each stages there was a season of change when it came to isaac there was a season of change hallelujah but before hallelujah isaac could be who he was holly god had to put somebody in isaac's life hallelujah that could produce a change all right hallelujah abraham said lord seeing that i got no air put this eliezer hallelujah lord i need i need an air so god allowed isaac to come forth and then we go some years some years prior now abraham's on his deathbed and everything he got is in the hands of eliza hallelujah and he said lord but i want to i want to give this to my son but now we're in a place where isaac is alive holiday but ellie's are still there now he's gonna give eliezer harley some orders these will already be playing by god he said eliezer i want you to go find my son or wife don't go to the denominations don't go back to the catholic church don't go back to the pentecostal church i want you to go amongst our family and i want to tell you single young people hallelujah god got something for you but you got to look amongst your family sister don't you go out there looking for isaac in the world brothers don't you glad they're looking for rebecca in the world stay with the family that's god's plan that's the only way it's gonna work church and i eliza he says ellie's i want you to go back down there to my family see now it's a season of change he says go back down and now eliza has a lot on his plate holy he has to find a wife for god look at your type abraham is god the father eliezer is the prophet isaac is jesus christ and rebecca is us but look at how rebecca came on the scene eliezer came down and he said lord lord i don't know what to do he said lord all i got is these gifts you gave me wow hallelujah he said lord all i got is the gifts you gave me he said but you know what lord i'm gonna speak the word he went out to the well he said lord let the next let my let my master's bride be the one who not only gives me something to drink but also give my camel something to drink see he was looking for a woman that could fulfill his vision [Music] see the only wife of isaac was the one that could fulfill hallelujah eliezer's fishing holiday and the only wife of jesus is the one that could fulfill malachi 4's vision hallelujah the only one the only one eliezer was looking for was the one that could catch the vision [Music] and not only just catch the vision but make haste and be diligent with it it's a seasonal change see rebecca was in eliza's path hallelujah she had to be there to fulfill the steps god had ordained for eliza and what did the message do the message called us to step into the prophet's past [Music] hallelujah because if that's not the case holy the prophet most of us hollywood may be born uh after 65 or or you know most of us let me say it like that the prophet was already gone but billy graham's voice was still here why aren't we baptists oh robert's voice was here why aren't we pentecostal because we were connected to one voice [Applause] even though the vessel was gone we're not connected to the vessel we're connected to the voice so my season my change has nothing to do with jeffersonville has nothing to do with arizona has nothing to do with norcal out of south carolina i'm following a voice [Music] church church they could stop people right now from visiting the relics in arizona they can stop people right now from heaven church in jeffersonville but i'll still receive a body change hallelujah because you look you look at rebecca her change came by being able to connect with the vision of eliza and she didn't even know who he was she was just living her life whoa she was just living her life she was just being who she was but her being who she was she was fulfilling the word for her day we not gonna leave this earth being some weak wishy-washy bride no that's not rebecca rebecca was strong she was diligent she was called of god church look at it he said lord let the woman for my lord holly be able to not only give me drink but give my cameras drink color let's look at today let's look at the plan of god church rebecca comes out there holly mind her own business but her mannerisms was to connect with the vision she wasn't showing off he was just a part of who she was there was something about her that just could connect with the scene that was unveiling in a spiritual realm hallelujah church she come down there she says my lord you want something to drink she gives him something to drink and he didn't even ask she just stepped into the vision [Music] church we're so much like rebecca because most of us never even met eliezer we never even met brother branham we just stepped into the vision [Music] [Applause] i wasn't there when he preached the seals but i just stepped into the seventh seal he said the seventh seal is the opening of the word and i just stepped into the opening of the word that's just who we are we weren't there we didn't preach spoken word authority huh but there's something about situations when it happened we just stepped into it why that's just who we are see what i want you to catch rebecca wasn't even thinking about eliezer [Music] it was just a part of her makeup and she just started fulfilling the vision [Music] what's hershey she gives him water and then the bible says she's go back and read she starts to make haste and diligently give the camels water now what i want you to realize hallelujah a camel hallelujah can drink over 20 gallons of water 20 gallons of water and eliezer had 10 camels so that woman was going back and forth and by the time she was finished she actually gave out 200 gallons of water [Applause] god told joshua be stolen of a good courage that's how you gonna possess the land nothing to be able to stand before you hallelujah let me just to show how powerful just to show how powerful that is sisters when was the last time you went to walmart and bought 10 gallons of milk you need a truck you need a truck but she didn't just do 10. she did 200. and the bible said she made hates she didn't stop until until the camels was like oh boy i'm full oh i'm whoa i so ain't thirsty no mo the camel's laid down the camels went down rebecca put the camels to sleep was enough and the problem of god said the beast that she fed the power that she gave him drank with the power that was going to take us to meet her king and i'm trying to tell you tonight put your troubles to sleep what satan is saying you can't do you are the bride you're more than able [Music] church but rebecca laboring and working she didn't even realize she stepped into a vision that was going to change her life forever very simple just by being diligent it changed her life forever [Music] [Applause] it was a seasonal change but rebecca holly was in the path of eliza and isaac was in the path of rebecca and god put it all together and look the family trying to stop it from happening but let me tell you something the only one that could make up the mind and make it go forward was rebecca hallelujah amen hallelujah what's going to stop us from getting to heaven nobody because we will have to say so whether you want to go or not you have the safe zone whether you want the holy ghost you got to say so whether you want to be healed your mama can't stop you your daddy can't stop you your brothers can't stop you [Music] mama said don't leave brother said don't leave and then the prophet came and said let her choose for herself [Applause] hallelujah and right there in that moment it didn't take a revival it didn't take a prayer service rebecca said i will go [Music] i will go i will go it don't take a special meeting i will go now is the time for my season to change i will go [Applause] see nobody knew who she was she was riding that camel the very thing that she gave drink but now she got a veil over her head nobody knows who she is church the bride has a veil overhead nobody knows who we are but we're on our way to meet our isaac [Applause] we're on our way to see isaac and only isaac is going to reveal who i am [Applause] bulma got to come down to a close church but you look how god had things pre-planned how do you go from isaac abraham had to fight for a season to change hollywood to get in the right path because you know isaac was in abraham's path holland but you know who was in isaac's path jacob and god said the two being born nobody done either good or evil but jacob have i loved and he saw have i hated and he held herself served the younger so no matter what esau could have did better than jacob he was never going to get the birthright because god had already pre-planned to give it to jacob because jacob was fulfilling the vision of the promise that god gave to abraham [Music] but you look at how this how this vision unveiled honey one day he was sitting at the house and esau came in the prophet of god said he was a twin hardly and y'all know when they came out the womb they were fighting and esau looked like to be the better man jacob looked like a little sister boy sitting at home with his mama but that boy know how to cook [Laughter] sitting at home learning how to cook was going to benefit him one day nobody knew that that was the plan of god every brother kelly everybody want to be like the prophet totten god's going hunting hallelujah but somebody might need to learn how to cook hallelujah you might can't hunt you might can't fish but you so know how to cook this word [Applause] you might don't hunt you might don't fish but when you get on that pulpit you know how to cook this word [Applause] hallelujah because god gonna use that ability one day because all those who know how to imitate the prophets one day they ain't going to be able to use imitation it's going to have to be something real internship hollywood esau comes back one day hallelujah he says he said man i'm hungry and jacob just because the way he was it was pre-planned by god he was built that way he said hey i got some food i got what you need i'll tighten you right on up bro [Music] hey kayla hey he's all looking man i'm hungry give it to me he said but look the only way you're going to get this is you sell me your birthright now god start to put things in place amen he had to give hallelujah amen he had to get isaac a wife hallelujah that would lie to him so so that her son could get the birthright because she was there hallelujah in isaac's in jacob's life hallelujah she was in his path that he may receive the birthright i ain't telling none of you sisters are lying to your husband hallelujah but there was a purpose of election there hallelujah so so so so so she had to be hallelujah she had to be a woman that could say okay son i'm gonna help you trick your prophet daddy this is what you do let's put some hair on your arms let me help you get this venison together we're gonna do all this stuff we're gonna spray you down so you can smell just like esau you know what was happening it was a season of change and god made sure isaac's eyes were dim so he couldn't see it was jacob and that day his discernment was a little off because he said you smell like esau but you sound like jacob but nevertheless let me bless you there's nothing that's going to stop your blessing [Music] let me speed up a little bit church this season being in god's path holly you know what was in his path anger was in his path because now that he got the birth right esau say i'ma kill him and now jacob hardly he turns into usain bolt running for his life he got to leave see sometimes change you got to leave everything behind i want you to understand let's understand what this change meant to him he had to leave his mama he had to leave his daddy holly and he couldn't even grow up with his twin brother [Music] he had to give up everything that the will and the cause of god may be fulfilled and he had to run for his life you know why he did it because there was something inside of him yearning for change and some of you they gave up everything for this message some of us they gave up jobs some of us they gave up family so they gave up churches why for greater cause what is it it's a fulfilling of god's thoughts see jacob didn't even realize he was fulfilling what god had already told rebecca the older gonna serve the younger but what did it look like he looked like jacob running away but it was the vision being fulfilled that god had already spoke over them it was election getting in place hallelujah but then we look at holiday jacobs gets down to where naming them at hollywood we're laying in a man and he sees a girl and he falls in love and he says you know what i got to have her he goes and does it right he goes and talks to the father he didn't slide into her dms [Music] he didn't go around the father he didn't go around the mama none of the parents he didn't go around the pastor see when you ain't got nothing to hide you go straight to the past and talk to him you go straight to the daddy and talk to him but when you sneaking [Music] prime example of a snake you post a picture he ain't just gonna like it he's gonna throw an adjective on it you're gorgeous you know that is those words are sowing a seed for you to do it again you're gorgeous and you're like there's more than a lot he but he spoke over me told me i'm gorgeous and the next time you put on that outfit you're thinking about those words gorgeous he said i was gorgeous now you got a spirit on you i'm gorgeous that spirit make you do things you normally wouldn't do now you put you pulling it up a little bit and you breaking it down a little bit because the man said you was gorgeous you look out for satan's words and if you get caught up next day you'll say he gonna get bold and he's gonna say send me a know what you picture to do you know what you gotta say so i got a picture for you i got one for you yes [Applause] [Laughter] [Music] yes see if you get a like on that or see if everything goes silent hallelujah rachel he says man i got to have her so he said what i got to do pops he said you got to work for me seven years he said that ain't nothing i go i gotta hold out seven years i'm gonna work this thing out sister if he can't wait till you ready he ain't the one if he's trying to pressure you pressure you with his words pressuring you with this pressure you with that tell him say look here bro you got to go we got some relationships going on here got some sneaking going on in here you better leave that little boy alone he ain't up to no good if his conversation ain't about the word he's a conversation ain't no good [Music] hallelujah and some of you daddy's slipping hallelujah daddy's you need to look at your girls and tell them they're beautiful so when some snake come around talking about you look girl you beautiful her response would be my daddy tell me that all the time [Applause] go about your business my daddy always tell me that that ain't no flattery my daddy always tell me that go about your business [Music] let me let me get off this he's in here though hallelujah but simbo somebody's sneaking parents i'm going to drop all the dimes they got pages but they got a clean christian page and then they got another page they got they got [Music] page y'all know ig you can have two accounts boy i'm telling all your secrets tonight oh boy we telling all your secrets tonight they got a private page well you got to get hooked up to get in there let me tell you something mom and daddy if you can't get in that page you slipping you paying the bill and they doing whatever they want to do oh my god let me get out of here church but look jacob he works seven years holly but then he gets to the altar and leah is there because the father had another plan but don't you know that was the will of god hallelujah that was the will of god harley jacob he would have gave her back why did he give her back he couldn't give her back you know why because she had went to the bad chamber she had seen this mystery she's seen his secret parts hallelujah and i'm here to tell you if you ever go to the bad chamber with jesus christ he can't give you back [Music] you can't go back no matter what they say about you you're not the one he originally won't yeah he originally wanted the jews but too late i didn't grip behind the bad chamber and he has injected his seed hallelujah but you look at the plans of god you look at hollywood a season of change not jacob has two wives one can have children and one can't and the other one is jealous of the one that can have children we'll start pushing them babies out and rachel got mad she said you know what i'ma give them my hands man then the hands may start having children then little say you know what i'm gonna give them my hands man and the hands may stop having children now i look like there's four women fighting over one man but that was the path hallelujah god ordained for jacob hallelujah because there are four women hallelujah who had the children of israel inside of them hallelujah and the only way that was gonna come out from leo rachel and two hands made that was god's plan hallelujah so sometimes what could look out of order is the order of god hallelujah but then we go past jacob and we get to joseph hallelujah and we look at it i'm gonna try to close with this you look at the church the promise of god still had to be fulfilled but now joseph he started to have dreams and his brother started to get mad at him you know i'm sick of you having dreams but just getting mad wasn't good enough he had to turn to something else so his daddy one day he made a coke y'all remember that he made a coat and he gave him that coat in front of his brothers and jacob put that coat on that coat of many colors he put that coat on in front of his brothers and he probably spent around like he was ric flair [Music] and right there from being mad from being angry turned into hatred because hatred was the only thing that was going to get him in the pit and he had to get in the pit because the the the caravan was on the way and the caravan how he was the only way he could get back to where he was supposed to be well it was a season of change but you know what it started with hatred and then god wasn't done what was in joseph's path jealousy and hatred from his brother and hallelujah then he got him part of his house and the next thing he had to fight was a lying demon a lust demon but he's coming into his season of change he got a woman hallelujah following him every day saying lie with me lie with me go read your bible she didn't do it just one time she was chasing that boy hallelujah until and joseph was resisting he was he was resisting hallelujah that was in his path and then one day she got tired of it and she put her hands on it and jake joseph said i can't do it get off me and ran for his life and now the next thing that's in his path he got to fight a lion demon remember what i started with your life is ordained by god it was ordained for him to fight a lion demon to fight a lust demon to fight hatred and jealousy from his brothers what is god doing putting them in position wow let him talk let him lie god has put me in position it's in my path hallelujah then church hollywood part of her comes in and she said you see you brought the slave in here and look what he tried to do he tried to take me and this and that and joseph like look you know she lying she lies no go to jail now he has to fight off bondage now he's in bondage but it's still a seasonal change now he's fighting up bondage harlow he's in jail but one thing i love about joseph hallelujah no matter which stage he got in the gift of god in his life never stopped working that's where we mess up hallelujah we start going through stuff and we come to church angry [Laughter] brother i hear it calling i say people like that you know what you are you like a broken washing machine because when it's balanced you can't even hear it talk to me sisters you can put that load in there and everything balanced it's just smooth even when it speeds up you can't even hear it but when that thing gets unbalanced you can hear a second in the living room you can hear a second in the kitchen you can hear it shaking in the bedroom and that's what happened when people hallelujah when they life get unbalanced and they come to church and tear up the whole anointing coming here don't want to praise him don't want to say hey man don't want to dance don't want to clap don't want to shout you want everybody to know you going through something [Applause] whether rebecca was having a bad day or not nobody knew about it she came out there with that water pot and she started working and she started working she started working she stepped into that vision he's fighting bondage he's in jail then the baker and butler comes down there and they start talking they have a dream both of them have a dream and joseph says my lord can interpret your dream so he interprets the dream three days one of y'all gonna die one day y'all gonna be restored and the one that was supposed to die he died the one that was supposed to be restored when he was getting restored when he was leaving the jailhouse now joseph has to fight being forsaken because he says remember me when you get back to your position and that's what happened to people hallelujah when they get back where they're supposed to be they forget the people that didn't pray for they forget the people that didn't call them and ask them how they doing they forget the church that they kept a good atmosphere when they was there and now he has to fight through being forsaken because the man had been restored hollywood but then god's plan all of them was in the path because through all of that joseph remained faithful through hatred through jealousy through lies through uh lust through being uh in bondage and now being forsaken god say i got another plan for you hallelujah now i'm gonna let pharaoh have a dream and the servant said i remembered my mistake there's a man down in your jail there's a man in your jail who has the gift to interpret he said bring him up he said wash him up clean him up put a ring on him change his clothes cause he finished stand before the king y'all know what that was that was a preview of the bride he wasn't even positioned yet but he was getting washed up he was getting dressed up to stand before pharaoh only to take his spot hallelujah so you let me go through trials you let me go to temptations and tribulations god has a spot that he's about to elevate us to [Music] all of that was in this path but then when he got there the gift of god just started working he said it gonna be seven years of famine seven years of increasing and then then the pharaoh said oh my god i need somebody to put over such a task and in that moment there was only one person that could get through that change there was only one person that could bring everybody else through that change and it was joseph hallelujah and now they put joseph in his seat hallelujah and joseph running the whole kingdom and the character of god when he met back up to the ones holly can you imagine now he's on the seat can you imagine zaddy what fair what uh potiphar's wife was doing every time she saw him because she know she had to lie can you imagine what the servant was doing they had forgot about him for all that time every time he saw him can you imagine hallelujah what the warden was doing in jail hulu who probably mistreated him while he was down there now he's in position hallelujah listen to me good everybody that treated them wrong they've come back around in his path where he got authority now because the bible says i make your enemies your footstool but what i love about god he gonna give you that kind of power if you can't handle it now he put everybody back in his hands why because he got the character to deal with it [Music] [Laughter] he even played a little game with his brothers but then he couldn't help but he started crying out ah it's me your brother what was it there was something in joseph harlem where he couldn't help but reveal the mystery and let them talk about you let them forsake you let them accuse you but there's something in you that can only reveal the mystery [Music] he said god has a way hallelujah we have a way but our ways are not his ways and we cannot be in our way and god's way at the same time so what i want you to do tonight i want you to examine your life and ask yourself are you living for you are you living for god he said just like a road map when i get ready to go home i don't say well now i'll set a campus that perhaps i might have direct east and north and from here well if i just took out if i just took out in that direction it would get me out the city but there's been a provided way made for me hallelujah church this message is a provided way back to heaven [Applause] [Music] he says he says i get a road map see which way the road turns the mark where i turn to the left or turn to the right and so forth and follow that map closely hallelujah i'll make my way home by the grace of god if you follow the map you'll make it back home by the grace of god that's why god the messenger hallelujah so that we could see the map plainly because there's a lot of people in here who can't read a map so god sent the prophet to spread the map out and show us that it was easy to read and when i used to have a job i used to be a truck driver and when they sent you the truck driving school one of the things you had to do is learn how to read a map but nowadays now you got gps drivers and if the gps go out they can't get the load to its destination we got too many gps christians living off the revelation of somebody else no you got to know how to read the map yourself [Music] you got to know the revelations of jesus christ for yourself you got to know why god sent the prophet yourself we're not living in a glare of another day you got to know god for yourself he says well god god has made god has a map he has a provided way for us to go home to glory he has to provide a way for salvation he has to provide a way to provide divine healing he has a provided way for the world to be operated he has a provided way hallelujah oh my i love it i love it church he says and we each one of us have a life that god has given us and we must live it there's a life that god has given each of one of us and we must live it hallelujah he said to my humble opinion if you listen to this if you get this he said i think the most best life in the world no matter whether it be up or down listen whether the best life in the world whether it be up or down somebody say up or down whether the life be up or down if we'll find god's path and work in it where god has ordained for us to walk hallelujah if we always we find victory no matter what hallelujah if you find god's path and walk in it you will walk in victory no matter what whether it's covet hallelujah 1916 18 if you walk in god's path you will have victory [Music] to show that paul's life was ordained of what god told him god told him what he said he said let me show him what he must suffer and listen paul says of the jews five times receive our 40 stripes save one thrice was beaten with rods once was stoned twice suffered shipwreck a night and day hallelujah have i been in the deep but none of that could stop him from fulfilling what god had for him hallelujah what did suffering do hallelujah oh my listen church in romans romans paul says who shall separate us from the love of god shall tribulation or distress or persecution or famine or negligence or sword hallelujah he says no what shall separate us nothing can separate us paul was speaking by revelation because he been through it [Music] paul was saying i was chosen to go through this to be an example to you hallelujah you just got to find your place where you find your place hallelujah you walk in triumph he says don't despise where god has got you but serve your purpose there's coming a great victory day one of these days where the battle is over when you find your purpose you'll be like john they say john who are you it was already prophesied by but isaiah there'll be a voice of one crying in the wilderness john stepped into that vision he said i'm the voice of one crying in the wilderness hallelujah but what was god doing in paul hallelujah why did he have to go through so much suffering because there was something in paul that god wanted back there was something he put in paul before the foundation of the world and god had wanted it back and the only way he could get it from him is through suffering hallelujah and what did it start hallelujah it started hallelujah in paul was the book of corinthians in paul was the book of ever since in paul was the book of philippians in paul the book of galatians imposed the book of colossians in paul with the book of romans in paul was philemon in paul was timothy and it took suffering to bring those books out because paul would start the book i paul an apostle paul in jail writing books of the bible what was it was the suffering bringing it out suffering was a part of god bringing out revelation [Applause] see god will put things in your path to bring out what he has in you that's why david was always in a battle why because the book of songs was in david david would go through a battle and david would begin to say the lord is my shepherd whom shall i fear the lord is on my side [Music] you know am i closing bethsheba was a part of david's suffering and david had to go through that david had to lie david had to produce premeditated murder david had to put the man on the first line then david had to be addressed by the prophet that was the only way he was going to see himself because he didn't see anything wrong with the way he was living but when the prophet came and began to show him his self david fell to his knees and said lord i have sinned so it took this message holy to bring forth a real repentance in the church because we were not living up to the standard of what was revealed that's why we repent we repeat because we've been called to a higher calling in god and we say lord i'm sorry lord i should be living with perfect love i should be walking with perfect faith i should be producing divine healing and it was by that mistake with beersheba that we got one of the greatest psalms ever creating me [Music] cast me not away from thy presence oh lord take not thy holy spirit from me now listen to david confess david say restore unto me the joy of thy salvation and renew my spirit within me took david to go through all that to give us that song it took paul to go through all that to give us half of the new testament and what you're going through is for the benefit of somebody else somebody's watching you somebody's watching you what are they watching they're watching you produce life [Music] because it's a season of change church that caterpillar for the first half of his life he struggles everywhere he goes an inch it's an inch it's an inch and then he gets to a stage where he just looks downright ugly he's in a cocoon looks like a mess nobody understands what he's going through he ain't fellowshipping with nobody he's still in the same place he ain't moving he's doing nothing he in a mess but that stage of his life is ordained of god but then there's gonna come a season where the cocoon gets weak hallelujah and the thing that once bind him he's stronger than it now huh and then he gets one wing out hallelujah then he gets the other wing out he gets the head out and then he begins to fly away from his past whoa he begins to fly away from his troubles he begins to fly away from that thing that once bound him never to return again [Music] so church you go back how many other years it was and you look at all the confusion and god did all that so that he could come out of his cocoon and the rest of y'all could come with him if i could be frank if i could be frank if things would have never happened you'll still be there y'all still be there but god allows certain things to take place why so new life and new growth could come
