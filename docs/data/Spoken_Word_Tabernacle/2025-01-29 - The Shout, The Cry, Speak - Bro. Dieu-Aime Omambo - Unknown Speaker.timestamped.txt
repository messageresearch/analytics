[58:50] pray amen
[58:52] amen amen um if we could all go to our
[58:57] scripture Matthew chapter
[59:22] 16 Matthew chapter 16 verse 13 to
[59:28] 19 if you thereare can you say amen amen
[59:31] the scripture says this when Jesus came
[59:34] into the coast of the queria Philippi he
[59:39] he asked his disciple saying whom do men
[59:42] say that I the son of the son of man am
[59:46] and they said some say that thou are
[59:49] John the Baptist some Elias and others
[59:52] Jeremiah or one of the prophet he said
[59:55] unto them them but whom say ye that I am
[59:59] and Simon Peter answered and said unto
[1:00:01] said Thou Art the Christ the son of the
[1:00:04] Living God and Jesus answered and said
[1:00:07] unto him blessed art thou Simon bar
[1:00:11] Jonah for Flesh and Blood have not
[1:00:14] revealed it unto thee but my Father
[1:00:17] which is in heaven and I say also unto
[1:00:20] thee that thou art Peter and Upon This
[1:00:23] Rock I will build my church and and the
[1:00:26] Gates of Hell shall not pre Prevail
[1:00:28] against thee and I will give unto thee
[1:00:31] the Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven and
[1:00:34] whatsoever Thou shalt bind on Earth
[1:00:37] shall be bound in heaven and whatsoever
[1:00:40] Thou shalt loose on Earth shall be loose
[1:00:43] in heaven may the Lord God bless the
[1:00:45] reading of his word yall may be
[1:00:53] seated um from our subject this morning
[1:00:55] morning IID like to continue on the
[1:00:58] shout the
[1:01:01] cry and speak and I remember earlier I
[1:01:06] was listening to um a military Cadence
[1:01:10] which is like a song that people in the
[1:01:11] military sing and one of them goes like
[1:01:13] it says v i c t o r y victory victory
[1:01:18] that's my Battle Cry and I just want you
[1:01:20] to keep that in mind that victory
[1:01:22] victory I take that as for myself that
[1:01:24] Victory that's my battlecry for 2025
[1:01:27] that Victory is my
[1:01:29] battlecry amen now for to start off I
[1:01:34] want to start with the Prophet The
[1:01:36] Prophet said in 1959 he says sometimes
[1:01:38] God cannot answer spontaneously how many
[1:01:41] knows that remember Daniel had prayed
[1:01:43] and I believe it and it was 21 days or
[1:01:47] something like that that before the
[1:01:48] angel could get to him but he finally
[1:01:51] gets around just leave it alone we
[1:01:53] already spoke about this I'm just going
[1:01:55] to like round that that we're going to
[1:01:56] um s so when um the subject says to
[1:02:00] shout and to speak because many time
[1:02:02] people are facing their trials instead
[1:02:04] of speaking they're just mourning and
[1:02:06] grieving well God said to speak in many
[1:02:09] occasion and sometime when people speak
[1:02:12] they they're they they have doubt in
[1:02:14] their own word instead of sticking with
[1:02:15] their word they have doubt and they're
[1:02:17] like well it's taking forever so since
[1:02:19] it's taking forever maybe it's not going
[1:02:21] to happen anymore but the prophet says
[1:02:23] sometime when God speak it doesn't
[1:02:25] happen simultaneous
[1:02:26] and God said that we're also God so when
[1:02:29] we speak maybe sometime it might not
[1:02:31] happen simultaneously so we might take
[1:02:32] our time
[1:02:34] sometime and in habakuk Chapter 2 verse3
[1:02:38] it say for the vision is yet for an
[1:02:40] appointed time but at the end it shall
[1:02:42] speak and not lie though it t wait for
[1:02:45] it because it will surely come it will
[1:02:47] not t see it says it will not t meaning
[1:02:50] it might not come in your time but it
[1:02:52] might come in God's time and God's time
[1:02:53] is always on time even if he appears as
[1:02:55] if it's late God's time is always on
[1:02:58] time now in Exodus chapter 13 it says
[1:03:02] chapter 13:1 17 says and it come and it
[1:03:05] came to pass when Pharaoh had let the
[1:03:07] people go that God LED them not through
[1:03:10] the way of the land of the Philistine
[1:03:11] Alto that was near for God said let
[1:03:15] pre-venture the people repent when they
[1:03:17] see war and they return to Egypt because
[1:03:20] if you look at this because the
[1:03:21] scripture say God's mind is above ours
[1:03:24] he knows better for us every step that
[1:03:25] we take he already pre-ordained it and
[1:03:27] God already knew that the Israelites
[1:03:29] were their faith was not at the level
[1:03:32] for them to go the shorter route to
[1:03:34] arrive at their destination God already
[1:03:35] knew that because if they were going
[1:03:37] they would already start asking back um
[1:03:38] to return because if you even look when
[1:03:40] they were crossing through the
[1:03:41] Wilderness when they didn't have bread
[1:03:43] they say oh did you come over here to
[1:03:44] kill us with Hunger see just simple
[1:03:46] things like that their faith wasn't even
[1:03:48] lifted up yet so God had to make them go
[1:03:50] through the Wilderness God God had to
[1:03:51] make them go through trials and show
[1:03:53] them to uplift their faith
[1:03:56] now in job 3: 25 for the thing which I
[1:04:01] greatly feared is come upon me and that
[1:04:04] which I was afraid is come unto me I was
[1:04:08] not I was not in safety neither had I
[1:04:10] rest neither was I quiet yet troubled
[1:04:13] see some s c um sometimes
[1:04:16] when because speaking sometime we speak
[1:04:19] certain things in our mind you see
[1:04:21] because speaking is not just something
[1:04:22] that you uh because when you speak it's
[1:04:25] just the thought expressed you see
[1:04:27] speaking is just the word expressed and
[1:04:29] when you're premeditating certain things
[1:04:31] you're creating an atmosphere within
[1:04:32] yourself and that atmosphere will
[1:04:34] attract whatever you're pondering upon
[1:04:37] and that's exactly what Paul did I mean
[1:04:39] job did here as he was premeditating on
[1:04:42] saying that oh he doesn't have a safu or
[1:04:44] anything like that when God was
[1:04:45] protecting him because when Lucifer went
[1:04:48] up to God and he was like look at your
[1:04:50] um your son over here and God was saying
[1:04:52] look at my son and um Lucifer was like
[1:04:55] well you're prot him he has a fence full
[1:04:56] of angels but job did not see
[1:05:00] that now in
[1:05:02] 1963 God doesn't call men to judgment
[1:05:06] without first warning him paragraph 112
[1:05:09] he says now when he speaks with when he
[1:05:11] speaks of his vision whether it's wrath
[1:05:14] or whether it's healing it may linger
[1:05:16] but it's got to come to pass if he
[1:05:19] speaks it in the name of the Lord see it
[1:05:22] might be blessing that he speaks for you
[1:05:25] might tell you a certain thing and you
[1:05:27] can't see it at all you say how can it
[1:05:30] be why it's he told me th sayth the Lord
[1:05:34] this is going to happen and that was
[1:05:36] going to happen and it ain't happen the
[1:05:38] man is wrong now you'll be judged for
[1:05:41] this believing it but it's going to
[1:05:43] happen anyhow see it's going to happen
[1:05:46] this remind me because one time I was
[1:05:48] hearing certain um Brothers they were
[1:05:50] talking over the message of um what the
[1:05:53] what brother brandham had said and
[1:05:55] talking about how brother Brena had
[1:05:57] given a prophecy talking about Russia
[1:05:59] and the United States everything like
[1:06:01] that and he and one brother was like
[1:06:03] well the United States is very powerful
[1:06:05] they have a lot of Army and military
[1:06:06] power so how can the United State lose
[1:06:09] and certain things like that and the
[1:06:10] others were like well brother Brandon
[1:06:13] say so it doesn't matter brother Brandon
[1:06:15] say so and if you read over here the
[1:06:17] prophet say it doesn't matter whether
[1:06:18] you believe it or not it's going to
[1:06:20] happen but you will be judged for your
[1:06:22] doubt you will be judged for your
[1:06:23] disbelief you see because when you add
[1:06:26] doubt to the word of God you're
[1:06:28] hybriding it you see you're hybriding
[1:06:30] the word of God with doubt and the word
[1:06:32] of God is not going to work when you
[1:06:33] have doubt with it even Jesus even Jesus
[1:06:37] own Ministry brother Jesus did more
[1:06:39] stuff in brother brenham's life than
[1:06:40] he's own white because people had doubt
[1:06:42] people's Faith was not at that level but
[1:06:45] now people us with the message that we
[1:06:48] have we should our faith should be
[1:06:50] higher we should be able to do more
[1:06:51] greater things that's what Jesus even
[1:06:53] said the Greater Works that we should do
[1:06:56] now in paragraph 113 says don't it
[1:06:58] linger the Bible said yet will it speak
[1:07:02] in in its in its season it'll come to
[1:07:04] pass the prophet's only looking off and
[1:07:08] seeing something he's talking about he's
[1:07:11] talking about that he's looking at he
[1:07:13] ain't thinking about here what you look
[1:07:16] like now he's looking what's going to be
[1:07:19] and when he speaks that if it's in the
[1:07:22] word of the lord it's already been spoke
[1:07:24] and there's no nothing in the world can
[1:07:27] stop it you see that's right only God
[1:07:29] himself that and God already said we're
[1:07:31] God that mean when we speak we should
[1:07:32] believe on what we say and there's
[1:07:34] nothing in the world in this world that
[1:07:36] can stop
[1:07:38] [Music]
[1:07:39] it now if we could go to Joshua
[1:07:43] chapter 6 verse 20 yes sir real
[1:07:50] quick if you're there can you say
[1:07:53] amen amen there's few
[1:07:58] amens amen Joshua chapter 6:2
[1:08:02] says so the people shouted when the
[1:08:05] priest blew the trumpets and it came to
[1:08:08] pass when the people heard the sound of
[1:08:10] the trumpet and the people shouted with
[1:08:12] a great shout that the wall fell down
[1:08:15] flat so that the people went up into the
[1:08:18] city every man straight before him and
[1:08:20] they took the city see if you pay
[1:08:23] attention the wall of Jericho fell down
[1:08:25] after they shouted because sometime
[1:08:27] you're going because Jericho can
[1:08:29] represent um a trial a tribulation in
[1:08:31] your life sometime you're going through
[1:08:33] certain things and instead of speaking
[1:08:35] you're just waiting there like we heard
[1:08:37] a few um Wednesday pass last Wednesday I
[1:08:40] believe when uh the word came forth he
[1:08:42] said Heaven is Waiting on you and you're
[1:08:43] waiting on Heaven instead of speaking
[1:08:45] when you're going through something
[1:08:46] you're just waiting and if you're
[1:08:48] waiting and you don't speak nothing will
[1:08:50] happen God came down God acted when they
[1:08:52] shouted you see
[1:08:55] because Jericho like I said it's a
[1:08:57] tribulation it's a war and the prophet
[1:08:59] says that if you'll notice God telling
[1:09:02] Moses about the Bible he said in the
[1:09:05] beginning God created the Heaven and the
[1:09:07] Earth period how long it took that's
[1:09:10] none of our business then he goes ahead
[1:09:13] and begins to bring in his time of
[1:09:15] putting seed in the Earth but in the
[1:09:18] beginning might have been hundreds of
[1:09:20] billions of trillions of years eons of
[1:09:23] time but God God created Heaven and the
[1:09:26] Earth period that settles it that's the
[1:09:28] first step see he makes no mistake
[1:09:31] sometime when we're faced St when we say
[1:09:33] certain things we think that oh because
[1:09:35] people have this um fairy tale
[1:09:37] imagination of things that PE that
[1:09:39] things need to happen in our time need
[1:09:41] to happen really fast like in America
[1:09:44] when when you're in America time is
[1:09:46] something that's even around the world
[1:09:47] time is something that's very on the
[1:09:49] budget so you put time even in what you
[1:09:51] speak you put time in the prophecies in
[1:09:54] your blessing you put time in them and
[1:09:55] when you put time in them when it
[1:09:57] doesn't happen your faith goes down
[1:09:59] you're wearing out your faith instead of
[1:10:00] just relying on the word because brother
[1:10:02] Bram said a real believer genuine True
[1:10:05] Believer sticks with the word no matter
[1:10:07] where what because Faith doesn't move
[1:10:09] and if you have God God who is Faith
[1:10:11] that faith will not move away from the
[1:10:13] word of
[1:10:14] God now in 1963 the prophet says now
[1:10:18] remember every spoken word of God is the
[1:10:21] Original Seed God planted everything in
[1:10:24] the Earth by his word and as long as you
[1:10:28] stay with the Original Seed it will
[1:10:30] breed itself right back and reproduce
[1:10:33] itself again H breed it and it dies that
[1:10:36] if you mix it with doubt the word of God
[1:10:38] will die because the scripture says you
[1:10:41] render the word of God the promises of
[1:10:43] God of none effect because you keep
[1:10:44] adding your Creeds and doctrines you're
[1:10:46] hybriding the word of God and it says
[1:10:49] paragraph 101 says and Eve the woman was
[1:10:52] the first hybrid thing that ever was now
[1:10:56] I hope you don't turn tapes you don't
[1:10:58] turn tapes off till we get down and
[1:11:00] prove that after a while see show you
[1:11:03] just why she was a hybri a bride notice
[1:11:07] through that brought death through
[1:11:09] trying to take the word of God and
[1:11:12] mixing it with some wisdom with it see
[1:11:15] you're not supposed to do that a
[1:11:17] Believer is not supposed to do
[1:11:20] that and whether you believe it got
[1:11:23] wisdom to explain it just say God said
[1:11:26] it and that settles it and God said so
[1:11:29] and that's all that it is to it if if
[1:11:33] you can't explain it leave it alone but
[1:11:36] just say it's so cuz God said so see
[1:11:39] that's it God said so I remember if few
[1:11:42] a while back when the word was coming
[1:11:43] forth and they were like everything um
[1:11:45] even brother brandom's life it's
[1:11:47] biblical it's tied to the Bible and I
[1:11:49] did not understand how I didn't know how
[1:11:51] but I just said amen and then later on
[1:11:52] the word came when I was looking and
[1:11:54] meditating and I looked at um I was
[1:11:58] reading brother Bram when he was going
[1:12:00] squirrel hunting and everything like
[1:12:01] that and if you pay very close attention
[1:12:03] when brother brenon had said two or
[1:12:06] three is a witness when he said two or
[1:12:08] three is a witness he was saying that as
[1:12:10] in the number of um as in the number of
[1:12:13] squirrel that he wanted but when as I
[1:12:15] was reading that I was like well two or
[1:12:17] three is a witness you say two or three
[1:12:18] but there's nobody with you there see
[1:12:21] there's nobody with you to M to witness
[1:12:23] the Miracles that you're doing then
[1:12:25] later on when he went against squirrel
[1:12:27] hunting and he lost one and he went back
[1:12:31] and told the other people that's when it
[1:12:33] stroke to me that oh brother Brandon's
[1:12:35] life is um attached to the Bible why
[1:12:38] because when he said two or three God
[1:12:40] did not want uh what's it called God
[1:12:41] wanted to manifest that scripture that
[1:12:43] two or three is a witness so God let
[1:12:46] that other squirrel be gone missing the
[1:12:48] one that he killed to go missing why so
[1:12:50] brother brand can now have witnesses
[1:12:53] that's when I noticed well since both of
[1:12:55] connected now brother Brandon has a
[1:12:56] witness and brother BR brother Brandon
[1:12:59] probably at the time didn't even notice
[1:13:00] that God purposely hid that other
[1:13:02] squirrel so he can have witnesses
[1:13:04] because brother Brenham himself say two
[1:13:06] or three is a witness but he was alone
[1:13:08] when he went hunting you see and now in
[1:13:11] paragraph 103 it says now notice now it
[1:13:14] will not mix it must it must not be
[1:13:17] tampered with God will punish the one
[1:13:19] that does it and it will not hybrid to
[1:13:22] to nothing else it's God's word alone
[1:13:25] alone God don't need your word with his
[1:13:28] we're not supposed to speak our word our
[1:13:31] own word we're supposed to preach his
[1:13:34] word God's word and God's word only
[1:13:36] because once again faith is God because
[1:13:39] if you look at the stature of a perfect
[1:13:41] man the whole entire thing is God
[1:13:42] himself and if you have faith you will
[1:13:44] stick with God's word and you will not
[1:13:45] deviate right and the prophet say in the
[1:13:50] spoken words The Original Seed he says
[1:13:52] what is the seed of life the word of God
[1:13:55] therefore for life you can't come
[1:13:57] through a Creed you can't come through a
[1:14:00] denomination you got to come back to the
[1:14:03] word now the seed of life all right his
[1:14:07] word is his seed and his spirit is the
[1:14:09] water see because the scripture said the
[1:14:11] power of life and death is in the tongue
[1:14:13] you see so you need to speak life into
[1:14:16] everything that you do and instead of
[1:14:18] speaking Darkness because God called us
[1:14:19] to be um to be a people to send out
[1:14:23] blessing and to inherit blessing how are
[1:14:25] you going to send out blessing if you're
[1:14:27] not speaking blessing if you're not
[1:14:28] speaking correctly if you're not
[1:14:29] speaking um positively you
[1:14:33] seeall and the prophet say in the
[1:14:35] statute of a perfect man paragraph
[1:14:37] 1886 knowledge not worldly IR reasons
[1:14:41] any kind of worldly um reasons see but
[1:14:45] faith has no reasoning God reveals to
[1:14:48] you a certain certain thing is going to
[1:14:50] happen every scientist in the world
[1:14:53] could tell you it's contrary it could
[1:14:55] not happen you believe it anyhow see yes
[1:14:59] sir it's not it doesn't risen the Bible
[1:15:02] said we cast down reasons you don't
[1:15:05] reason with faith faith has no reasoning
[1:15:07] Faith knows where it's at faith faith
[1:15:11] acts Faith holds on it can't move
[1:15:14] nothing can move it I don't care
[1:15:17] whatever says this that other it doesn't
[1:15:20] move a bit it stays right there wait
[1:15:24] wait wait wait don't make any difference
[1:15:26] it stays right there and people say well
[1:15:28] I have faith I have faith well did you
[1:15:30] wait did you stick with your own word
[1:15:32] did you stick with the word that God
[1:15:33] gave
[1:15:35] you the prophet says and speak to the
[1:15:37] mountain paragraph 36 of 1959 says now
[1:15:41] then on this scripture I could not
[1:15:44] justify myself to preach on it how did
[1:15:47] you notice Jesus said here verily I say
[1:15:49] unto you if ye shall say to this
[1:15:53] mountain be plucked up and cast onto the
[1:15:55] sea and don't doubt but believe in your
[1:15:59] heart that what you have said shall come
[1:16:01] to pass you can have what you
[1:16:04] said now I could not justify that
[1:16:07] because I could not understand it how
[1:16:09] then could it be that I could say
[1:16:11] something as a man and then how what if
[1:16:13] I said something that wasn't according
[1:16:15] to his word and ask something something
[1:16:18] was according to his
[1:16:20] word then it would have to come to pass
[1:16:23] because Jesus said if if you say not if
[1:16:26] I say but if you say placing it upon his
[1:16:29] Apostles upon the Believers whosoever
[1:16:32] shall say onto this mountain be moved
[1:16:34] and don't doubt in their heart but
[1:16:37] believe that what they have sh what they
[1:16:40] have said shall come to pass they can
[1:16:43] have what you said not what he said what
[1:16:46] you said you see because many people
[1:16:48] like speaking negative things upon their
[1:16:49] own life when they see the circumstance
[1:16:51] they like speaking negative things
[1:16:53] they're like well this this this and the
[1:16:55] third they're like like if you're my
[1:16:57] friends a couple of them they would ask
[1:16:59] me sometime they like um do you ever
[1:17:01] curse and I'm like no when they asked me
[1:17:04] have you ever cursed sure I did in the
[1:17:06] past but have you ever do you ever curse
[1:17:08] now I'm like no I don't curse why is
[1:17:10] that I'm like I simply don't curse and
[1:17:12] the reason why is that is because when
[1:17:13] the word was being preached earlier um a
[1:17:17] while back and it said to be perfect and
[1:17:20] when Abraham the way Abraham was perfect
[1:17:23] because God told Abraham to be perfect
[1:17:24] and the Abraham was perfect it was
[1:17:26] because he was speaking positive he was
[1:17:28] speaking things into existence he was
[1:17:30] keeping with God so if I also want to be
[1:17:33] perfect I should speak positive that
[1:17:35] mean cursing is not C cursing is not
[1:17:38] perfect cursing is not of God because
[1:17:39] God said for us to bless and watch
[1:17:41] should our curse you see so sticking
[1:17:43] with God that mean you speak perfect you
[1:17:45] because the prophet said that God is
[1:17:46] perfect and if God is perfect his word
[1:17:49] is perfect and if his word is perfect
[1:17:51] and you're speaking his word that mean
[1:17:52] you're speaking perfect that's exactly
[1:17:53] what um abrah did that's exactly what
[1:17:56] Abraham did now in paragraph 38 the
[1:17:59] prophet says now to me that took it away
[1:18:02] from the atonement and P it upon the
[1:18:04] person I canot understand it and it's
[1:18:07] been about three or four years ago when
[1:18:09] I run so just reading over it it I
[1:18:12] noticed the three wither and I thought
[1:18:15] just the miracle of God but yet there
[1:18:17] wasn't there was something begin to pull
[1:18:19] at my mind you have you examined that
[1:18:22] scripture that you can have what you
[1:18:25] you can have what you have said if you
[1:18:27] say it and then believe that you have it
[1:18:30] you can have what you said that puzzled
[1:18:33] me I just bypassed that that part of the
[1:18:36] scripture for I realized this that I'm
[1:18:38] responsible to God for what I say before
[1:18:42] the purchase of his blood I realize that
[1:18:45] God will make me answer for it at the
[1:18:47] day of judgment therefore being sure a
[1:18:50] human as humanly as possible before I
[1:18:52] say anything I want to be right and and
[1:18:54] all through the scripture be right not
[1:18:57] just right in one place but right in
[1:18:59] every place it must be exactly the same
[1:19:02] it must come from Genesis to Revelation
[1:19:04] the same if he doesn't then I might be
[1:19:06] saying something wrong that's exactly
[1:19:08] why I said even when my friends asked me
[1:19:10] I usually speak perfect even if you ask
[1:19:12] my there's certain things certain words
[1:19:14] I don't even say even saying by and
[1:19:15] stuff like that I don't even say anymore
[1:19:17] you can ask my cousin they would tell
[1:19:18] you why but there's certain words
[1:19:20] certain phrase I don't say Al people say
[1:19:22] that oh you're being too spiritual and
[1:19:24] stuff like that I'm like well I don't
[1:19:25] care when when it's revealed to me I
[1:19:27] will act according to the Revelation
[1:19:29] that is revealed to
[1:19:32] me now in Matthew chapter
[1:19:35] 26 um paragraph I mean verse 39 it says
[1:19:40] and he this is Jesus Christ and he went
[1:19:42] a little farther and fell on his face
[1:19:44] and prayed saying oh my father if it be
[1:19:46] possible let this cup pass from me
[1:19:49] nevertheless not as I will but as thou
[1:19:51] will as we've been learning about the
[1:19:53] human record and the Divine record Jesus
[1:19:55] was 100% men and 100% God see when he
[1:19:59] was facing a um tribulation when he was
[1:20:01] facing a trial and he saw what was
[1:20:03] coming his human part kicked in and he
[1:20:04] was like Lord God I don't want to feel
[1:20:06] this suffering I don't want to feel this
[1:20:07] pain I don't want to feel this on me but
[1:20:09] then his Divine part also kicked in and
[1:20:11] he said not my will but your will you
[1:20:13] see a lot of us when we're going through
[1:20:15] Tri instead of letting a Divine part
[1:20:17] kick in we're relying too much on our
[1:20:19] Earthly um on our Earthly uh
[1:20:23] records and if you look even at Malachi
[1:20:25] 3 where we where the inspiration of the
[1:20:28] U book of remembrance came from as it
[1:20:30] was being preached it says and now we
[1:20:33] call the proud happy yay they that work
[1:20:36] wickedness are set up yay and they that
[1:20:39] tempt God are even delivered see many
[1:20:42] people when they're going to many
[1:20:43] Believers when they're going through
[1:20:44] trials they see other people in the
[1:20:46] world how they're prospering and they're
[1:20:47] like well God you're doing this and this
[1:20:49] for them but how about us you're doing
[1:20:51] this and this for everybody else how
[1:20:53] about us you see there always keeping
[1:20:55] they're they're not they're forgetting
[1:20:57] that God even is a God because I
[1:20:58] remember if I believe it was proverb
[1:21:00] chapter 31 the first um 6 to eight verse
[1:21:05] when he was talking about the way for a
[1:21:07] king to live and he was say not to drink
[1:21:09] this and this and the third I was uh I
[1:21:11] was sharing it with s some of my
[1:21:13] coworker a while back and as I was
[1:21:14] sharing it one of the U manager
[1:21:16] supervision came by and he was like what
[1:21:18] are you doing I was like since he wanted
[1:21:20] to be nosy I was like well here's the
[1:21:21] scripture read this tell me what you
[1:21:23] think about this then he read it he was
[1:21:25] like well the scripture is saying for
[1:21:26] you to just completely drink you see and
[1:21:29] I was like when I read that scripture
[1:21:31] the thing that came to my mind was the
[1:21:33] scripture was telling people you might
[1:21:34] as well just go on I know it may sound a
[1:21:37] bit harsh but it was simply saying you
[1:21:38] might as well go kill yourself why
[1:21:40] because you're you're as a Believer you
[1:21:43] have a God why are you in a place where
[1:21:45] you're so depressed so depressed to the
[1:21:48] point where you feel like you're already
[1:21:49] killing yourself because in that way
[1:21:51] when you're thinking about those stuff
[1:21:52] and you're because the scripture says
[1:21:54] give strong drinks to those that are
[1:21:56] ready to perish you see because if
[1:21:59] you're already ready to perish you're
[1:22:00] meditating on that you're spiritually
[1:22:01] killing yourself you might as well just
[1:22:03] end it at that you see that's why I say
[1:22:06] that scripture might be strong but
[1:22:07] that's that's the way I saw it because
[1:22:09] God is God if God be God why are you
[1:22:11] that sad a Believer shouldn't be that
[1:22:13] sad when a trial is facing a Believer
[1:22:16] shouldn't be feeling like if there's a
[1:22:17] rope tied around their neck when they're
[1:22:19] going through a trial you see and then
[1:22:22] it says verse 16 it says then they that
[1:22:26] fear the lord spake often one to another
[1:22:29] and the Lord huren and heard it and the
[1:22:32] Book of remembrance was written before
[1:22:34] him for them that feared the Lord and
[1:22:36] that thought upon his name see those
[1:22:38] people that pondered upon God and they
[1:22:41] shall be mine said the Lord of hosts and
[1:22:44] in that day when I make up my jewels and
[1:22:47] I I will spare them as a man spareth his
[1:22:49] own son that serveth him see the book of
[1:22:53] remembrance God created that book
[1:22:55] because people were pondering about upon
[1:22:57] him when they're facing a trial they're
[1:22:59] pondering upon God they're not too too
[1:23:01] much face um looking at the negative
[1:23:03] they're not too much looking at the
[1:23:04] reality that's within them but they're
[1:23:06] looking at the reality of the word
[1:23:07] because there's our reality yet after
[1:23:09] there's God's reality you see when God's
[1:23:11] word comes forth automatically that's
[1:23:13] another reality coming in so you should
[1:23:15] step into that word because when that
[1:23:17] reality come in and you're not step into
[1:23:19] the the reality that's going to come you
[1:23:21] will be left behind you
[1:23:23] see amen in 1962 brother BR say
[1:23:26] paragraph 31 of the spoken word now this
[1:23:29] word of God is eternal God being
[1:23:32] infinite cannot speak one thing then
[1:23:35] later on change it to something else to
[1:23:38] be to a better decision because every
[1:23:41] decision of god is perfect he cannot
[1:23:44] once his word is once spoken it can
[1:23:47] never die it lives on and on and on and
[1:23:51] can never die because it is God he worth
[1:23:54] can no more die than he that he can die
[1:23:58] that's the reason we read in first John
[1:24:00] or St John first chapter that in the
[1:24:03] beginning was the word and the Word was
[1:24:05] with God and the Word was God and the
[1:24:08] Word was made flesh the same word that
[1:24:10] was spoken in the beginning his with his
[1:24:13] eternal purpose came on over and was
[1:24:17] made flesh and dwelt Among Us God's word
[1:24:20] you see God's word does not die God and
[1:24:23] His word are the same thing
[1:24:24] and the same thing and since God said
[1:24:26] also we're um Gods when God's word goes
[1:24:29] It goes on and on that's what the
[1:24:31] scripture says and that mean how about
[1:24:33] us Believers because he said we're God
[1:24:35] that mean when we speak our words will
[1:24:37] also go go will also go on and on you
[1:24:39] see the prophet of God says some years
[1:24:42] ago I heard that a woman now this may
[1:24:45] not be authentic that licked her tongue
[1:24:48] in the uh radium while mixing it to put
[1:24:51] on hands of th of clocks and watches it
[1:24:54] killed the woman and years later keeping
[1:24:58] her skull for an autopsy like they said
[1:25:01] you could take an instrument whatever
[1:25:04] they they use and put against that skull
[1:25:08] bone and with a rumble you could still
[1:25:11] hear that radium going on in her skull
[1:25:14] after she had dead after she had been
[1:25:19] dead for years radium continuously goes
[1:25:22] on the word of God continuously goes on
[1:25:25] see when you speak see when you when you
[1:25:27] speak negative your word will also keep
[1:25:28] going on see because God said when he
[1:25:31] gave us the power that mean when you're
[1:25:33] speaking something negative that mean
[1:25:34] you're manifesting something
[1:25:36] negative and I remember a while back
[1:25:38] when I was um when I was looking to uh
[1:25:41] an element of ether and I was like I was
[1:25:43] trying to understand what it was and
[1:25:45] based on the dictionary definition of
[1:25:47] ether it's if a very rare uh it's a very
[1:25:50] rarified and a uh highly elastic
[1:25:53] substance firmly believed to be a
[1:25:56] particle of matter and to be a medium
[1:25:58] whose vibration con constitute light and
[1:26:02] all the electromagnetic radium in other
[1:26:04] words it was just like a medium um of
[1:26:07] space for light and and stuff and I
[1:26:09] remember brother Brandon spoke uh about
[1:26:11] ether also he said when you speak your
[1:26:13] word you speak it to The Ether see and
[1:26:15] brother B also gave another
[1:26:18] example um he gave an example over here
[1:26:21] actually he says I I'm told that if we
[1:26:24] could pick up an instrument that could
[1:26:27] catch it that's a man's voice my voice
[1:26:29] that I speak today 10,000 years from now
[1:26:32] could still be picked up in the air you
[1:26:35] see like dropping a pedal in the middle
[1:26:38] of a pond the tiny little waves after
[1:26:41] they fail to be seen by the eyes
[1:26:43] continue until he hits the bank and the
[1:26:46] Air wave of our voice continually
[1:26:48] travels around the world around the
[1:26:50] world therefore then our voice what we
[1:26:53] say will will be or judgment you see
[1:26:56] when you're speaking curses and you're
[1:26:57] speaking negative over your life it will
[1:27:00] keep going all the way to judgment
[1:27:01] that's why you will be judged upon you
[1:27:03] see exactly Our Testimony will our
[1:27:06] testimony will rise right against us our
[1:27:09] own voices will echo in our own ears at
[1:27:13] the Judgment bar of God when his great
[1:27:16] instrument catches every voice that's
[1:27:19] been spoke every word that's been
[1:27:22] moded and now there's only one way to
[1:27:25] stop that voice that's wrong see there's
[1:27:28] only one way whenever you speak negative
[1:27:30] over your life because even with my
[1:27:32] siblings I apply this even with my
[1:27:34] siblings whenever I'm talking to them if
[1:27:36] a negative thought come or I'm about to
[1:27:37] say something wrong I automatically stop
[1:27:39] my and I'm like Lord God forgive me I
[1:27:41] Repent automatically because there's
[1:27:42] only one person that can take back that
[1:27:44] word that you speak and it says and now
[1:27:47] there's only one way to stop that voice
[1:27:50] that that's wrong that's repent God
[1:27:53] Alone can stop it if he doesn't it goes
[1:27:56] on and meets up with you in eternity
[1:27:59] therefore God being perfect and his
[1:28:01] voice Eternal his own voice will have to
[1:28:04] catch up with it therefore he must be
[1:28:06] perfect in every decision for when he
[1:28:09] once say something it has to go all the
[1:28:12] way and come back to the Jud U come back
[1:28:14] to the Judgment you see when you speak
[1:28:16] negative and because brother BR was
[1:28:19] pondering upon this he like what if I
[1:28:20] say something negative that mean God
[1:28:22] gave us the PN if I say something
[1:28:23] negative it will happen
[1:28:24] then how would I take it back and the
[1:28:26] way to take it back is repent and put it
[1:28:27] up to God just bring it up to God and
[1:28:29] God is the only one that's capable of
[1:28:31] taking it because if you look at Psalms
[1:28:33] it says only God judges the god you see
[1:28:35] that mean only God is capable of taking
[1:28:37] that away the words that you spoke in
[1:28:39] the negative words that You' spoken or
[1:28:41] that somebody has spoken over your life
[1:28:43] only God is capable of taking that away
[1:28:44] just bring it back to
[1:28:47] God now in paragraph 88 brother BR says
[1:28:51] and something said to me say what you
[1:28:53] will will be done this um this was
[1:28:56] actually when brother BR was given a
[1:28:58] warning that he was going to be trapped
[1:28:59] and brother BR didn't know what the Trap
[1:29:01] was but it was two couples that were um
[1:29:04] that were casing in the U front row and
[1:29:06] just distracting the prophet and it says
[1:29:09] something said say blindness and you
[1:29:12] will be blind say death and they shall
[1:29:14] pack them they shall pack them out say
[1:29:18] what you will see I was thinking about
[1:29:20] this because I remember um if you
[1:29:23] remember the spirit of comes on five
[1:29:25] times and when he came first he was in
[1:29:27] Elijah the second time he was in in
[1:29:29] Elisha and if you pay very close
[1:29:31] attention the spirit of Elijah which is
[1:29:33] the spirit of God in the prophet the
[1:29:35] spirit of Elija of Elijah in Elisha
[1:29:38] spoke death because there were little
[1:29:40] children that were making fun of him
[1:29:42] because of the circumstance that he was
[1:29:44] in he spoke death and killed about 41
[1:29:46] little children but watch that same
[1:29:48] Spirit came back now in brother brandham
[1:29:51] and watch what brother brandham speaks
[1:29:52] he says I could couldn't speak I
[1:29:54] couldn't move and he just left I thought
[1:29:57] God what what must I do and I turned and
[1:30:00] he stood there and his face why looking
[1:30:02] at me I thought what must I say and I
[1:30:05] turned then I turned and looked like
[1:30:08] before I knew it what i' say I said I
[1:30:11] forgive you I forgive you of your act
[1:30:15] and it must have been just the right
[1:30:18] thing to say it was God trying a
[1:30:20] reaction on an action that's that night
[1:30:24] it was revealed to me that I had said
[1:30:25] the right thing I know it was all
[1:30:27] leading to something but what was it
[1:30:30] what to do see the spirit the spirit of
[1:30:33] Elijah in Elisha spoke death but the
[1:30:35] spirit of Elijah in brother Brandon
[1:30:37] spoke life he spared them he spoke Grace
[1:30:39] he spoke mercy and since we're since
[1:30:42] we're under the since we're under the
[1:30:44] leadership in this age we're under the
[1:30:46] leadership of God under the leadership
[1:30:49] of brother brandham who's under God that
[1:30:51] mean we're supposed to repeat what he
[1:30:52] did he showed Grace and Mercy there some
[1:30:55] of us when we're facing trials and
[1:30:57] people are just cursing at us people are
[1:30:59] speaking bad towards us and some of us
[1:31:01] tend to um speak bad back back to them
[1:31:04] you see instead of speaking bad just say
[1:31:06] I forgive you you see show mercy and
[1:31:08] Grace just as your Prophet has showed
[1:31:10] mercy and Grace you
[1:31:12] see now as for the
[1:31:15] shout as for the shout because remember
[1:31:19] when you shout when you speak that's
[1:31:20] when the Wall comes down you see that's
[1:31:22] when God steps into the sin and and
[1:31:24] stuff happens it says um in 1965 lean
[1:31:27] not to your own understanding paragraph
[1:31:28] 147 lean not to your own understanding
[1:31:31] if you lean on your own understanding
[1:31:33] today when you are sick maybe sitting in
[1:31:35] a wheelchair dying with cancer heart
[1:31:38] trouble and doctor says you're going to
[1:31:40] die if you lean to that understanding
[1:31:43] you'll die but don't lean to that
[1:31:46] understanding certainly not because I
[1:31:48] have a friend who told me um his parents
[1:31:50] say oh you might have this symptoms and
[1:31:52] stuff like that they're not it wasn't
[1:31:53] his biological U family he said you um
[1:31:56] you might have their symptoms and he
[1:31:58] told me about that and when he told me
[1:31:59] that symptom they said oh you might have
[1:32:01] this disease I told him well the symptom
[1:32:04] that you just came from telling me just
[1:32:05] sound like something everyday children
[1:32:07] do that's not really a symptom they're
[1:32:09] trying to speak over your life and stuff
[1:32:11] like that you're accepting you shouldn't
[1:32:12] accept it at all you see see I have no
[1:32:14] problem with doctors and stuff like that
[1:32:16] when I'm Ill I would go to the hospital
[1:32:17] and when they will tell me what I have
[1:32:19] now I know the name of the devil that
[1:32:20] I'mma go home and speak over you see
[1:32:22] that's simply it and brother brandham
[1:32:24] says what about at what about at the
[1:32:28] walls of Jericho that they say they
[1:32:30] could run a chariot race around the top
[1:32:33] of them them great big walls God said go
[1:32:36] up there and March around it so many
[1:32:38] times and sound the trumpet and all of
[1:32:41] you let out a shout and the war is going
[1:32:43] to fall down you see well that was
[1:32:46] absolutely would be silly to the cornal
[1:32:48] mind but Joshua knowing how thick the
[1:32:52] how thick those walls was cuz he sir cuz
[1:32:56] he had built plenty of walls down in
[1:32:58] Egypt he know the cement that was in
[1:33:01] them how tight they were to hold them
[1:33:04] chariot races races on top and even
[1:33:08] houses built on top of it because if you
[1:33:10] remember back in Egypt the whole
[1:33:11] Israelites were slaved that mean all of
[1:33:13] them probably had a PhD in construction
[1:33:15] you see and but he didn't lean to his
[1:33:19] own understanding he buil he believed
[1:33:22] what God Said was true and obeyed his
[1:33:25] word and was and and the walls fell down
[1:33:28] leading not to his own understanding you
[1:33:30] see he relied on God he did not rely on
[1:33:32] that experience that he gained from
[1:33:34] being in Egypt you see and brother
[1:33:36] Brenham say in the Patrick of Abraham
[1:33:38] paragraph 58 brothers and sisters when
[1:33:42] he got over there Jericho was all walled
[1:33:45] up high enough that they could run three
[1:33:48] three chariots across the top how could
[1:33:51] these Israelites do it with barriers
[1:33:54] picked up sword and everything and stick
[1:33:57] sticks and stones how were they going to
[1:33:59] go in there but he was still in the Seed
[1:34:01] of Abraham God gave give him a vision
[1:34:05] Tau him how to do it said sound a Tropic
[1:34:08] amen that's it let let out a shout March
[1:34:13] up towards the wall and the gates will
[1:34:15] fall before you you see just let out a
[1:34:17] shout and your problem will come to an
[1:34:19] end amen he was a royal Seed of Abraham
[1:34:23] he was was God's real believer the gates
[1:34:26] will drop down before you just let out a
[1:34:29] shout and sound the trumpet that's all
[1:34:31] you have to do and what happened the
[1:34:33] gates fell down and Joshua took the city
[1:34:35] because the word said whatever you bound
[1:34:37] on Earth shall be bound in heaven so
[1:34:39] just let out your word just speak your
[1:34:42] word brother Brandon Contin continues
[1:34:45] and says in L to on understanding
[1:34:47] paragraph 149 says what if he was
[1:34:49] fighting the battle and as I was
[1:34:52] preaching on Sunday and then the sun was
[1:34:55] going down and the enemy was routed that
[1:34:57] night they would get together and they
[1:34:59] would come with another Force kill
[1:35:01] plenty of men now what if what if he
[1:35:05] would have said I need some daylight
[1:35:08] I've got to have some more sun sunlight
[1:35:12] well now wait a minute god Set this
[1:35:14] order and the sun turns so the World
[1:35:17] Turns now let's see if I would say for
[1:35:20] the sun to stop maybe if the world stops
[1:35:23] now then it lose its gravity gravitation
[1:35:27] and I'll fall you see he didn't listen
[1:35:30] to his understanding only thing he said
[1:35:33] was Sun stand still and moon stay where
[1:35:36] you are and it was and he obeyed him he
[1:35:39] didn't lean to his own understanding but
[1:35:42] he leaned to the promise of God I have
[1:35:44] given you that land go and get it
[1:35:46] because many time people tend to rely on
[1:35:49] on their own understanding based on
[1:35:51] what's Happening based on the
[1:35:52] circumstance people rely on their own
[1:35:54] understanding because many of my friends
[1:35:55] some be like in this economy you can't
[1:35:57] do this this and the third and when I
[1:35:59] look at them I'm like well God put me in
[1:36:01] this economy that mean I can't do this
[1:36:03] this and the third God cannot put you in
[1:36:04] a place where you're incapable of doing
[1:36:07] something you
[1:36:08] see and the prophet say didn't Jesus say
[1:36:13] the prophets who who the word of God
[1:36:15] came to who did the word of God come to
[1:36:19] congregation said prophets prophets
[1:36:21] didn't Jesus call them gods
[1:36:24] why why God was manifested in them what
[1:36:28] was it the spoken word manifested see
[1:36:31] that's it said how can you deny say if
[1:36:34] you had any wisdom you'd understand he
[1:36:37] said how can you say how can you say you
[1:36:41] we call them God himself called them
[1:36:43] Gods God himself called you God how
[1:36:44] would you deny that If you deny that
[1:36:46] you're you're denying your own identity
[1:36:48] you see you're denying your own position
[1:36:50] your own rights you see
[1:36:53] and the prophet continu says the Bible
[1:36:56] has got to be in you the word is a seed
[1:36:59] and as long as it's laying here it it
[1:37:03] won't do nothing but when it comes in
[1:37:07] here when it comes in the heart when it
[1:37:09] begins to
[1:37:11] manifest by the by the Holy Spirit The
[1:37:14] Works of God then Visions come Powers
[1:37:18] comes humilities come
[1:37:22] all all your know it all is gone you
[1:37:25] come nothing you become nothing Christ
[1:37:28] becomes alive you die he lives there it
[1:37:31] is cuz he died I live and when I die he
[1:37:36] lives and when I die he promised me life
[1:37:40] and I died and I died out to myself so
[1:37:43] in order I can have his life and now and
[1:37:48] how do I do it by taking his word his
[1:37:51] seed put his seed in here by faith and
[1:37:54] believe it and then it produces exactly
[1:37:57] what the Bible said you see when when
[1:38:00] you die to yourself and rely on that
[1:38:02] mind that let that Mind Of God be in you
[1:38:04] and you rely on that mind it's not you
[1:38:06] living anymore but it's God in you they
[1:38:09] ask that you do is no longer your act
[1:38:10] but it's God himself acting and just
[1:38:13] like when brother Brown was pondering
[1:38:14] about how did the prophets do all that
[1:38:16] before the atonement because the holy
[1:38:17] spirit in them is the one that's
[1:38:19] speaking it's not them who's speaking
[1:38:20] but the Holy Spirit the third person of
[1:38:22] the trinity in you that's working and
[1:38:24] that's doing their works that's
[1:38:26] right and the prophet says you can't be
[1:38:30] a seed and disagree with the word
[1:38:32] because the word is the seed and if
[1:38:34] you're the if you are the word how can
[1:38:37] you disagree with it you'd be
[1:38:39] disagreeing with yourself you'd be
[1:38:41] defeating your own purpose you see like
[1:38:44] somebody said why would you why would
[1:38:46] you ever go out with them people like
[1:38:49] that and well if I didn't do it I'd be
[1:38:52] defeating the very purpose I was saying
[1:38:53] here for there's got to be a light like
[1:38:56] when they ask Jesus and Jesus were like
[1:38:57] well I'm with the poor I'm with the
[1:38:59] people that are sick because they need
[1:39:00] me you see and if you don't act upon the
[1:39:03] word that's given unto you the prophet
[1:39:05] say you're defying yourself because many
[1:39:07] people many believer many Believers when
[1:39:10] they're going through a trial instead of
[1:39:12] looking upward they're just looking down
[1:39:13] they have their head down you see I
[1:39:15] remember when the word was spoken over
[1:39:17] here he said he said young man's young
[1:39:19] sister when you're walking walk with
[1:39:20] your head up you see walk with your head
[1:39:22] up your chest to walk bold you see stop
[1:39:24] walking with your head down because God
[1:39:26] is not down there God is up there so you
[1:39:28] have to look up as you're walking you
[1:39:30] see you have to look up as you're
[1:39:32] walking look up to God you see the
[1:39:35] prophet of God said do you think it was
[1:39:37] the prophets talking have you have not
[1:39:40] you just got through preaching on this
[1:39:42] subject that the prophets was so
[1:39:44] Anointed with the holy spirit that it
[1:39:47] wasn't them that done it speaking it was
[1:39:50] the Holy Spirit in them crying out then
[1:39:53] whatever you say if you're anointed
[1:39:56] wouldn't be you saying it it would be
[1:39:58] the Holy Spirit saying it well I thought
[1:40:02] if that may that's right the person
[1:40:05] through the atonement Sanctified by the
[1:40:07] blood of Jesus Christ can live into a
[1:40:09] sphere with the god with God so close
[1:40:13] that he can be wrapped so completely in
[1:40:16] God by the blood of Jesus that it
[1:40:19] wouldn't be him talking it would be the
[1:40:21] holy spirit in speaking these things and
[1:40:25] no matter then I'd say tell the
[1:40:27] anointing the anointing of the Holy
[1:40:29] Spirit struck me like that I've never
[1:40:31] had before in my in in all my life God
[1:40:35] knows that I raised up to my feet God
[1:40:38] scared and something said now this is
[1:40:40] the beginning of your new ministry now
[1:40:43] ask what you will and it shall be done
[1:40:46] it shall be given to you you see this
[1:40:48] was the spoken word that that Revelation
[1:40:50] that you need to speak was the beginning
[1:40:52] of brother B new ministry and brother
[1:40:54] Bram needed to step into that new
[1:40:56] ministry you see because many Believers
[1:40:58] when they're walking in their Journey of
[1:41:00] Faith when they're walking through the
[1:41:02] Journey of the life of brother Brenham
[1:41:04] instead of walk because when brother
[1:41:06] Bren stepped into a a new ministry many
[1:41:08] people don't step into a new ministry
[1:41:10] see when brother BR steps into a new
[1:41:12] revelation many people don't step into a
[1:41:14] new revelation like like these past few
[1:41:16] years that's been going around when the
[1:41:18] word is coming and talking about
[1:41:19] Christmas yes brother Bram used to
[1:41:21] celebrate Christmas or speak about
[1:41:23] but when a new revelation Came Upon him
[1:41:26] and he stepped into that new revelation
[1:41:28] why must you stick to the bad re the old
[1:41:31] Revelation that brother Bram had you see
[1:41:33] you need to step into that new
[1:41:36] revelation now brother BR continues and
[1:41:39] says so going on up there that anointing
[1:41:42] struck me again and said if it isn't
[1:41:45] there say it be there and you'll find
[1:41:48] the squirrel and I said Lord I'm taking
[1:41:53] your word now I said and I shall find
[1:41:57] the squirrel on the mountain on the
[1:41:59] mountain I went and I thought no need
[1:42:01] for me to fear anymore cuz I'm going to
[1:42:04] find it that's all I done said it and
[1:42:07] the Lord said when that anointing was on
[1:42:10] me when I said anything it would be that
[1:42:13] way so I'm going I'm going on see
[1:42:16] brother Brandon from there on was
[1:42:17] stepping into his new ministry he was
[1:42:20] stepping into the new revelation so
[1:42:22] y'all tonight need to also steep into
[1:42:24] the new ministry steep into the new
[1:42:25] revelation you see when brother Brandon
[1:42:28] was in um when brother brand had the
[1:42:30] first uh oil when the second oil came he
[1:42:32] had to step into that second oil I don't
[1:42:34] know why people are still um relying on
[1:42:36] that old oil that had already burnt out
[1:42:38] you see they're relying on the burnt out
[1:42:40] oil instead stepping into the new oil
[1:42:42] the new oil which is unlimited because
[1:42:45] if you look when when the spirit of
[1:42:47] Elijah multiplied the oil the first time
[1:42:49] it was limited it was in a space of
[1:42:51] three and a half year but when he came
[1:42:53] again and multiplied oil it was until
[1:42:55] that that family had passed away you see
[1:42:57] it was
[1:42:59] unlimited brother brandom says the angel
[1:43:02] of the Covenant well you people who's
[1:43:05] received the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:43:07] has got a witness has got a witness Jes
[1:43:11] that Jesus Christ lives and Reign ought
[1:43:14] to be an easy thing for you to believe
[1:43:17] in Divine Healing why Joshua know just
[1:43:20] as soon as they started shouting the WS
[1:43:23] was going to drop the victory was his
[1:43:26] cuz God said so that's a said so see you
[1:43:30] need to speak that's why I say even
[1:43:31] earlier victory victory that's my
[1:43:33] battlecry that's my battlecry throughout
[1:43:34] 2025 you see and I will stick to
[1:43:37] that and I will stick to
[1:43:41] that let me just read one more um quotes
[1:43:45] then I'll will let y'all go I know it's
[1:43:47] a Wednesday night
[1:43:53] [Applause]
[1:43:56] now in closing in 1959 speak to the
[1:43:59] mountain paragraph 205 brother brandham
[1:44:02] says
[1:44:03] this brother brand says this I believe
[1:44:07] that the Christ I believe that the
[1:44:09] Church of the Living God is moving into
[1:44:12] a sphere now that's going to be sh
[1:44:16] that's going to shake the whole world
[1:44:18] that's right that's the first time it's
[1:44:21] been that's the first time it's been
[1:44:24] since the days of of Jesus of Nazareth
[1:44:27] to human being ask anything that you
[1:44:29] will and it shall be given unto you
[1:44:31] anything you desire don't see don't you
[1:44:35] see the words of Jesus Christ being
[1:44:38] fulfilled being fulfilled and oh it's
[1:44:41] going to come to pass pretty soon I'm
[1:44:46] looking I'm looking for it happen in
[1:44:49] this meeting I'm wanting it to happen
[1:44:53] now just like me I'm wanting it to also
[1:44:56] happen here you see I'm wanting it to
[1:44:58] happen now that that anointing will
[1:45:01] strike the whole Church of the Living
[1:45:04] God and she'll rise to her feet like a
[1:45:08] mighty marching Army the sick will be
[1:45:11] healed by a word the the sick will be
[1:45:15] healed by a word blind will see the de
[1:45:18] will hear the dead will be raised up and
[1:45:21] the power of God will shake the world
[1:45:24] with the Church of the Living God with
[1:45:27] the Church of the Living God we're in
[1:45:29] the process of it now I believe it's
[1:45:31] soon coming to pass I believe it will be
[1:45:35] just exactly that way I believe it's
[1:45:37] going to strike that I believe it's
[1:45:39] going to stract that it's going to
[1:45:42] strict the Church of God soon and it's
[1:45:44] going to start a Revival that's that
[1:45:47] will shake the world I believe it the
[1:45:49] Lord God Of Heaven who made heaven and
[1:45:53] Earth
[1:45:54] who who whose servant I am and stand
[1:45:58] here now before you in the name of Jesus
[1:46:00] Christ those words are true uh oh we're
[1:46:04] near something my heart is waiting with
[1:46:08] anticipation I can't even rest in my
[1:46:11] hotel in my hotel room last night I
[1:46:13] couldn't even I couldn't sleep at all
[1:46:15] it's never left me I couldn't sleep on
[1:46:18] the road out here I didn't sleep about 2
[1:46:21] or 3 hours a night
[1:46:24] night I couldn't I I just can't rest
[1:46:27] because I know that something is fixing
[1:46:29] to happen or God is going to move on the
[1:46:32] scene just as sure as we're standing
[1:46:35] here just as sure as he said back Yonder
[1:46:38] about the discernment in the hand of in
[1:46:41] the hand and the secrets of the heart he
[1:46:43] promised he's promised something else
[1:46:46] and here is the
[1:46:48] is and here it is already confirmed
[1:46:50] among the people and the people standing
[1:46:53] here you see and the people standing
[1:46:56] there just to sum it up the message
[1:46:59] today I want you when you go back home
[1:47:01] when you go back to your daytoday life
[1:47:03] just speak the word over your obstacles
[1:47:05] because God said the power of life and
[1:47:06] death is in your hand if if you even
[1:47:08] look at history in when you watch the
[1:47:11] France their Kingdom when they had their
[1:47:12] independence or whatever when they had
[1:47:14] it they asked the the queen what do um
[1:47:16] the people are hungry the people want
[1:47:18] something and she was like let them eat
[1:47:19] cake and what she spoke brought death
[1:47:21] onto her because she not think about
[1:47:23] what she was speaking properly she did
[1:47:24] not have the right thing to say she said
[1:47:26] the wrong thing and he brought death and
[1:47:28] C some of us were saying the wrong thing
[1:47:30] in our situation I want you to forget
[1:47:32] that and stick to the word of God and
[1:47:33] speak the right thing as many people as
[1:47:36] many Saints in the Bible has even Esther
[1:47:39] Esther when Esther was going she didn't
[1:47:41] know what the um what the king liked but
[1:47:43] when she went over there and then many
[1:47:45] people were speaking their were picking
[1:47:47] up their own garment and she spoke the
[1:47:51] right thing by asking oh can you dress
[1:47:53] me can you tell me what the king like
[1:47:55] because she's a woman she could have
[1:47:56] been like well I'm a woman I know how to
[1:47:58] dress you see I know what fits me but
[1:48:00] she relied on the uh on the um on the
[1:48:03] Chamberlain she relied on the
[1:48:05] Chamberlain and I want you to speak
[1:48:07] positive speak the right things stick to
[1:48:08] the word of God and say Amen to every
[1:48:10] word that come just like sister AR right
[1:48:12] when when the word had came and the
[1:48:14] pastor the prophet was talking about his
[1:48:17] miracles she said that's right and she
[1:48:19] didn't even know what to speak but then
[1:48:20] the spirit told her what to speak and
[1:48:22] she said the right thing you see I want
[1:48:24] you to speak under the inspiration and
[1:48:26] speak and prophesy under God I remember
[1:48:28] when I was looking at the um book of
[1:48:30] Deuteronomy chapter 2728 it was when
[1:48:33] Israelite was stepping into a new place
[1:48:36] you see there there was this whole
[1:48:38] entire law that came and he was telling
[1:48:40] them oh you have blessing on this
[1:48:41] blessing on top of blessing on top of
[1:48:43] blessing if you follow God's word you
[1:48:44] will have blessing and blessing and
[1:48:46] blessing but there's also another side
[1:48:48] to it you see when you don't listen to
[1:48:50] God because when I was listening to I
[1:48:51] was like that is very
[1:48:53] because one of the scriptures said even
[1:48:55] a man can espouse a woman to be married
[1:48:58] but that he says it wishes for them that
[1:49:01] if you ask um if you ask a woman to be
[1:49:05] married with them the curses says that I
[1:49:08] pray that even your neighbor will sleep
[1:49:09] with her before you marry him I was like
[1:49:11] that is very harsh but that's only due
[1:49:13] if you don't follow the word because
[1:49:15] there was blessing and there was Curse
[1:49:17] God blessed the Earth and bless the
[1:49:18] ground that they're with they bless
[1:49:20] their flocks and everything but at the
[1:49:21] same time if you don't stay with the
[1:49:23] word God will that same word will change
[1:49:25] and that that judgment will fall down
[1:49:26] you see because the Bible said Prosper
[1:49:29] as your spirit Prosper it doesn't say
[1:49:31] Prosper as your imagination and
[1:49:33] Fantasies Prosper it said Prosper as
[1:49:35] your soul Prosper you see because if
[1:49:37] your soul is aligned with God and the
[1:49:39] more you grow with God the more you will
[1:49:41] prosper you see the more blessing will
[1:49:43] come to you you see that's why my prayer
[1:49:46] for 2025 as we're stepping into 2025 we
[1:49:49] already stepped into 2025 for the
[1:49:51] remaining of the year some people
[1:49:53] already gave up and it's only the first
[1:49:55] month you see it's only the first month
[1:49:57] so I want you to keep pushing even if
[1:50:00] it's hard keep pushing and stay in right
[1:50:02] with the word may the Lord God bless you
[1:50:05] if we could all stand so we can
[1:50:10] pray let us let us bow ahead let us bow
[1:50:13] oure in
[1:50:17] prayer Lord heavenly father I come
[1:50:19] before you tonight Lord heavenly father
[1:50:21] to Thank You Lord God for the word that
[1:50:23] was spoken Lord God I thank you for
[1:50:25] everything that you've done Lord
[1:50:26] heavenly father thank you for moving me
[1:50:27] out of the way and speaking to your
[1:50:28] people Lord God and I pray Lord Heavenly
[1:50:30] Father things that I may have left out
[1:50:32] Lord Heavenly Father may you reveal it
[1:50:33] onto your your children as they go
[1:50:35] releasing and meditate onto it Lord God
[1:50:37] may you reveal it unto them and may they
[1:50:38] speak wherever they go may they speak
[1:50:40] perfectly as Lord Heavenly Father you
[1:50:42] have ordered us to speak perfectly and
[1:50:44] may they stick with the word and not div
[1:50:46] you with the word because your Prophet
[1:50:47] Lord Heavenly Father say he would like
[1:50:49] if we'd have more young men Lord Jesus
[1:50:51] Christ young young people Lord heavenly
[1:50:53] father that stick with the word exactly
[1:50:55] with the word and don't deviate away
[1:50:56] from it and I pray Lord heavenly father
[1:50:58] that you be with us Lord Heavenly Father
[1:51:00] watch over both the visible and
[1:51:02] invisible audience Lord Heavenly Father
[1:51:03] protect us in our you know in the
[1:51:05] highways and byways and as we go to our
[1:51:07] respective Place Lord God watch over us
[1:51:09] over our tribs Lord heavenly father Yes
[1:51:11] Lord Heavenly Father we're humans yes we
[1:51:13] have flaws yes sometime our human nature
[1:51:15] May kick in Lord God but may you Lord
[1:51:17] Jesus Christ trigger that divine nature
[1:51:18] Lord God to kick in and remind us Lord
[1:51:20] Jesus Christ there's a God in heaven
[1:51:22] instead of looking down let us look up
[1:51:23] Lord heavenly father and let us look
[1:51:25] unto you Lord Jesus Christ because even
[1:51:27] when your word came down in Revelation
[1:51:29] you gave it to us and he told us to
[1:51:30] speak and we're not speaking nothing
[1:51:32] else but your word Lord God so I pray
[1:51:34] Lord Heavenly Father give us strength
[1:51:35] and let us speak your word Lord heavenly
[1:51:38] father I pray for those that are sick
[1:51:39] and Afflicted Lord God may you touch
[1:51:41] them may you heal them completely Lord
[1:51:42] God I'm letting the word that's coming
[1:51:44] over out over here Lord God may you
[1:51:45] travel through the ether May travel
[1:51:47] through the mediums and touch their soul
[1:51:48] lord heavenly father and heal them
[1:51:50] completely because because Lord heavenly
[1:51:53] father in eternity we we won't have Lord
[1:51:55] Heavenly Father the chance to speak your
[1:51:57] word and heal the sick why because there
[1:51:59] won't be any more sickness everything
[1:52:00] will be perfect then the only time that
[1:52:02] you can show your greatness Lord
[1:52:04] heavenly father it's now Lord heavenly
[1:52:05] father so take this opportunity Lord God
[1:52:07] to touch your children so they may speak
[1:52:09] perfectly Lord heavenly father so they
[1:52:11] may stick right with your word so they
[1:52:13] may rely on you everything and all
