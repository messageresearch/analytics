[55:47] tonight how many you glad to be back in
[55:50] the house of the Lord
[55:52] tonight amongst the Believers
[55:56] you know I was thinking over the last
[55:58] Services we heard and um God just been
[56:01] he's been pounding on
[56:03] faith I don't know if anybody else
[56:05] noticed that he's been pounding on faith
[56:07] and know I was talking with my wife I
[56:09] was like God is trying to get somebody
[56:11] ready for a Rapture that's right and and
[56:14] he he knows if you don't have that type
[56:16] of Faith there's no Rapture and and and
[56:19] that's the reason why he's still in the
[56:21] basement for four months because he
[56:23] can't leave until we develop that faith
[56:26] yeah cuz he said he won't lose none so
[56:29] in order for that to be true he got to
[56:31] make sure we get the type of faith that
[56:32] we need so we can take a Rapture but I
[56:35] don't know about you but I'm looking to
[56:36] go up one of these
[56:39] mornings amen yes sir and this in is
[56:42] he's trying to get us to go back to that
[56:44] Faith yes sir that original faith that
[56:47] the Pentecostal fathers had and and and
[56:50] and he said am Malachi folk came to do
[56:52] that came to turn the hearts of the
[56:54] children back to the fathers and and and
[56:56] and we we got to develop that Faith yes
[56:58] sir so if you got your Bibles let's turn
[57:02] to I try not
[57:04] to it's imperative I'm going have to use
[57:07] this scripture tonight Psalms
[57:13] 82 I I don't see no way around it
[57:16] tonight I'm going to have to use Psalm
[57:17] 82
[57:19] tonight
[57:24] and you know brother B say the Sheep
[57:27] will take the spirit of the
[57:30] pastor all right and and I I don't
[57:34] believe we just here by chance I mean I
[57:36] believe there's a special group of
[57:37] people here that's designed just for the
[57:40] ministry that's here and know I was
[57:42] talking to brother Stephen in the back
[57:43] and we was talking about it I believe I
[57:44] said your ministry is designed for a
[57:46] certain class of people it's not for
[57:49] everybody so so you
[57:52] know and and I even had someone I even
[57:55] had someone to throw shadeed at me
[57:56] because of this message because of what
[57:59] I teach and what I believe but but my
[58:02] message was that when when we came here
[58:03] I seen a line of cars at Burger King
[58:06] I've seen a line of cars at McDonald's
[58:07] I've seen a line of cars at zby but
[58:10] they're all eating from two three
[58:11] different tables so let me eat at the
[58:14] table that I am if that makes sense you
[58:18] you're not going to find nobody in
[58:19] McDonald's lying worrying about a
[58:21] Whopper that's at Burger King you you
[58:23] let them
[58:24] be so so so if I believe this message
[58:27] you let me eat at this
[58:29] [Applause]
[58:31] table and that settles
[58:37] it you got you got to stand for
[58:41] something and and I'm not I'm not I'm
[58:44] usually not the type of person that will
[58:45] let people know but sometimes you got to
[58:47] let them know what you
[58:48] [Applause]
[58:50] believe sometimes you got to let them
[58:52] know what you believe
[59:04] Psalms 82 and we we know this verse God
[59:06] standeth in the congregation of the
[59:08] mighty yes sir and he judgeth among the
[59:11] gods amen you can be
[59:18] seated and I want to go to verse six as
[59:22] well and verse seven this this is what I
[59:25] need uhh I have said ye are Gods sir and
[59:30] all of you are children of the most
[59:33] high in verse seven says but ye shall
[59:36] die like men and fall like one of the
[59:39] princes that's right so by the help of
[59:43] this board I'm going try to use this
[59:45] board this this go I have to do this
[59:50] tonight glory to
[59:52] God
[59:54] amen amen
[59:59] here we go yes
[1:00:03] sir so we got verse
[1:00:05] six and we got verse seven yes sir which
[1:00:09] we all know that verse six is the Divine
[1:00:12] verse yes my brother which I'm I'm I'm
[1:00:15] going to say God cuz that's what we are
[1:00:19] tonight and verse seven is is is the
[1:00:22] human part yes sir
[1:00:28] amen okay yes
[1:00:31] sir my title tonight is a
[1:00:36] testimony by
[1:00:39] faith a
[1:00:41] testimony by
[1:00:43] faith and I'm I'm not I'm not talking
[1:00:46] about that
[1:00:47] testimony after you receive what it is
[1:00:50] you want we we we talking about if you
[1:00:52] want to call it a pre-
[1:00:54] testimony and and and this testimony
[1:00:57] only lives by faith because you
[1:01:00] testifying about something you haven't
[1:01:02] received yet or you testifying about
[1:01:05] something that that you can't see with
[1:01:07] the natural
[1:01:08] eye so we we want to talk about a
[1:01:11] testimony by faith tonight my
[1:01:14] brother now brother brandham talks about
[1:01:17] two levels of faith and and he calls he
[1:01:21] calls one is the human Faith that's
[1:01:23] exactly which is your natural Faith yes
[1:01:25] sir
[1:01:26] and and and you know you this this is
[1:01:29] carnal you know no this is the type of
[1:01:31] faith that you possess as a natural
[1:01:33] human being that's right and the second
[1:01:35] level he talks about is which is God's
[1:01:37] faith yes my brother which is the
[1:01:39] supernatural Faith or the Divine Faith
[1:01:42] yes sir and and that that is what this
[1:01:45] guy possess the supernatural Faith or
[1:01:48] that Divine faith that Faith to believe
[1:01:49] things that you can't see that it
[1:01:52] exist and the human this human faith it
[1:01:55] can only go so far but bam
[1:01:58] says see this this faith has no
[1:02:02] power this Faith right here has no
[1:02:05] power the only thing this this this
[1:02:08] person right here can do this part of
[1:02:10] you can do is produce the testimony
[1:02:13] about this
[1:02:15] guy that that's the further that this
[1:02:17] part of you can go is a testimony yes
[1:02:19] sir and and and and and believe it or
[1:02:21] not the testimony of this guy is what
[1:02:24] pleases this guy
[1:02:26] God God say he pleased with a testimony
[1:02:29] by faith so if you want to please God
[1:02:31] you got to have a testimony by faith and
[1:02:35] by the help of the Lord we're going to
[1:02:36] show that to you tonight hope that the
[1:02:38] Holy Ghost will can reveal that to you
[1:02:42] tonight in the message blind bmus yes
[1:02:46] sir in
[1:02:47] 1956 brother ber says you're a wonderful
[1:02:51] set of
[1:02:52] people he said I don't believe you can
[1:02:55] find any any more faith is what I mean
[1:02:58] to as what would call what we would
[1:03:02] call and and he goes on and say I'll
[1:03:04] explain it to Mara the levels of Faith
[1:03:07] you see what human faith is and what
[1:03:10] divine faith is yes sir he says one of
[1:03:13] them is the human faith and the other is
[1:03:16] the is the one is the Divine Faith
[1:03:18] that's right and then he goes on in the
[1:03:21] message of faith is our Victory and he
[1:03:24] says but I will say this after this
[1:03:27] thing I preach conviction to myself he
[1:03:30] said I believe if you would just be
[1:03:32] reverent and just take all the faith
[1:03:35] that you got as human faith and turn it
[1:03:38] over into the hands of God and say now
[1:03:40] Lord take my little I got to give you
[1:03:44] and let your faith come to me I believe
[1:03:47] that he he'll heal you and let me call
[1:03:49] you right out from this platform without
[1:03:51] even you coming up here at all so butter
[1:03:54] Bron was was saying you know this
[1:03:57] Congregation of people they came to but
[1:03:59] Brown on meetings because they they they
[1:04:02] seen the healing the healing that he was
[1:04:04] doing the healing campaign that he was
[1:04:05] doing the these people weren't
[1:04:07] Christians some of these people weren't
[1:04:09] Christians but they believe if they
[1:04:10] could have got the brother BR they could
[1:04:12] they could get healed so so they brother
[1:04:15] bham saying if if you could have enough
[1:04:17] Faith right to believe in him that to
[1:04:19] believe that the God that was in him
[1:04:21] that could perform whatever that that he
[1:04:23] wanted that they could get it so so so
[1:04:26] that that's going to show you that that
[1:04:28] this guy well brother bam is saying the
[1:04:31] faithful lever in this guy can only go
[1:04:34] so far that's right so so so what so the
[1:04:37] job of the faith level in this guy is to
[1:04:40] believe that God is
[1:04:42] able to perform that which what he want
[1:04:46] and that pleases God and and and that
[1:04:49] what makes God come
[1:04:51] down see God come down he takes the look
[1:04:54] the faith that you have
[1:04:56] in him and then he comes down and mix
[1:04:58] his facei with yours and bring it to
[1:05:00] pass see see only in this faith if
[1:05:04] there's no waver wavering in this Faith
[1:05:07] all things come to pass in this Faith
[1:05:10] you always get results in this Faith
[1:05:15] there's a limitation on that human
[1:05:20] Faith let's go to this message
[1:05:24] uh be
[1:05:27] Be not
[1:05:39] Afraid be not afraid it
[1:05:43] is be not afraid it is I in
[1:05:51] 1961 and brother Brenham says this he
[1:05:54] said there's only one One Faith and
[1:05:57] that's the faith of God Amen God's faith
[1:06:00] yes he says your human Faith don't go
[1:06:03] very far but God's faith in you yes
[1:06:07] brother so so so there's two levels of
[1:06:11] it but but there's only one kind and
[1:06:15] that's and that's that's the faith of
[1:06:16] God and that's what God's going to honor
[1:06:19] his word he's only going to honor his
[1:06:21] faith but he's pleased when you can take
[1:06:24] your human faith and believe that He's
[1:06:27] [Music]
[1:06:33] Able you'll bear with me for a
[1:06:37] minute the message the Queen of
[1:06:43] Sheba am
[1:06:48] man and he says but bam says
[1:06:56] he said always remember Church God's
[1:06:59] word are true I believe the right mental
[1:07:03] attitude towards any Divine promise of
[1:07:06] God will bring it to pass he said if you
[1:07:09] can look at look at it in the right way
[1:07:12] he said but remember here's being my
[1:07:15] standard in life yes I have tried to do
[1:07:17] this the first thing I want to find out
[1:07:20] whether it's the will of God or
[1:07:23] not he said then I know it's God 's will
[1:07:26] the next thing is my objective to
[1:07:29] it and my motive in doing it he said
[1:07:32] then if it's the will of God and my
[1:07:34] objective is right and my motive is
[1:07:37] right I have faith that it'll be done
[1:07:40] because first is the will of God and I
[1:07:43] have and my objective is to glorify him
[1:07:46] and my motive is to give him all the
[1:07:48] glory see so there is no selfish motives
[1:07:52] about it if you have a selfish motive it
[1:07:55] won't work if your objective is to make
[1:07:58] money for yourself or something why you
[1:08:00] will never succeed he say and then try
[1:08:02] to do something outside of the will of
[1:08:04] the Lord then it won't work it begin
[1:08:07] with so there is genuine Faith yes sir
[1:08:10] but you must come to into the real
[1:08:12] channel of
[1:08:14] God to have that genuine Faith he said
[1:08:17] there is human Faith then there's faith
[1:08:20] of God and you must have that Godly
[1:08:22] Faith to believe to have Godly Faith you
[1:08:26] must have the mind of Christ in you then
[1:08:29] that's how God projects to you Visions
[1:08:32] Revelations and all these things come by
[1:08:35] the mind of Christ being in you you get
[1:08:37] it let the mind that was in Christ be in
[1:08:40] you yes sir that's why Jesus was so
[1:08:42] boldly when he approached
[1:08:44] situations because he had the mind of
[1:08:46] Christ and he said I do nothing unless
[1:08:49] the father show me so he already had the
[1:08:52] vision before he even went to approach
[1:08:54] the problem so so when you pray for thus
[1:08:57] sayth the Lord and God can reveal to you
[1:09:00] that it's thus sayth the Lord there's no
[1:09:01] room for
[1:09:04] doubt there's no room for doubt so
[1:09:07] that's the correct way you go you won't
[1:09:09] just said the Lord so once God reveal to
[1:09:11] you that whatever you want is what he
[1:09:13] want then you have no room for doubt
[1:09:17] then you can approach that situation
[1:09:19] boldly why because God has shown me
[1:09:22] thust said the Lord this is for me
[1:09:25] this is for me can't nobody take it away
[1:09:27] from me cuz God showed me so the devil
[1:09:30] can't talk me out of that cuz God
[1:09:31] revealed it to
[1:09:32] [Applause]
[1:09:36] me and and and and that and that's what
[1:09:39] you
[1:09:40] want that's what you
[1:09:48] want sir
[1:09:51] Hallelujah GL to
[1:09:53] God in the Church age thou has not
[1:09:57] denied my faith it says in Acts 3:16
[1:10:01] when Peter was asked how the mighty
[1:10:03] Miracle had taken place upon the
[1:10:06] crippled one at the gate beautiful he
[1:10:09] explained it on this wise and his u in
[1:10:12] jesus' name through faith right in Jesus
[1:10:15] name have made this man former
[1:10:18] strong y the faith which is by him Jesus
[1:10:22] have given him this perfect soundness in
[1:10:25] in the presence of you all see there it
[1:10:27] is Jesus name and Jesus Jesus Faith
[1:10:31] brought about the miracle right Peter
[1:10:33] did Peter did not claim it was his own
[1:10:36] human Faith any more than he claimed
[1:10:39] that it was his own name he said that
[1:10:41] Jesus name used in the faith which is
[1:10:44] from Jesus performed that great work yes
[1:10:46] sir this faith is what the Lord was
[1:10:48] speaking about in Revelation 2:13 it was
[1:10:51] his faith it was not faith in him but it
[1:10:54] was his own faith that he had given to
[1:10:57] the Believers brother in Romans
[1:11:01] 12:3 according as God have dealt to
[1:11:04] every man according to verse one the men
[1:11:07] or Brethren The Measure of
[1:11:10] Faith and then Ephesians chap 2:8 Say by
[1:11:14] grace are you saved through faith and
[1:11:17] that faith is not of yourself it is a
[1:11:20] gift of God and it also says in James 2
[1:11:24] verse1 my brother
[1:11:25] have not the faith
[1:11:29] of have not the faith of in our Lord
[1:11:32] Jesus Christ with respect the persons
[1:11:35] right and it says in this in this
[1:11:37] pergament age where men were humanizing
[1:11:39] salvation having turned from the truth
[1:11:42] that salvation is of the Lord having
[1:11:44] cast aside the doctrines of election and
[1:11:47] open wide the church door and their
[1:11:48] Fellowship to any and all who who
[1:11:51] subscribe to their tenants never mind
[1:11:53] the word in this age of rapid
[1:11:55] degradation there were still the few who
[1:11:57] had the measure of that Faith of Our
[1:12:00] Lord Jesus Christ and not only used that
[1:12:03] faith in Acts of power but with stood
[1:12:05] those who darare to say that they were
[1:12:07] saved simply on the grounds of joining a
[1:12:09] church they knew that no man could truly
[1:12:12] believe unto eternal life and the
[1:12:14] righteousness of God apart from the
[1:12:15] measure of the faith of the Lord Jesus
[1:12:18] himself yes sir as today church is
[1:12:21] filled with mental believers who endur
[1:12:23] the Virgin birth and shed blood going to
[1:12:26] the church and taking communion or not
[1:12:28] reborn at all even so in that third age
[1:12:30] was the same problem human Faith wasn't
[1:12:33] enough then and it is not enough now it
[1:12:37] takes the very faith of the Son of God
[1:12:39] to drop into a man's heart so that he
[1:12:41] can receive the Lord Of Glory into the
[1:12:44] temple not made with
[1:12:46] [Music]
[1:12:50] hands now let's turn to the book of
[1:12:54] Hebrews yes
[1:12:55] Hebrews 10 chapter
[1:13:15] 10 chapter 10 verse
[1:13:21] 38 now we going to get into the to the
[1:13:23] subject
[1:13:26] a testimony by
[1:13:30] faith and verse 38
[1:13:33] says now the just shall live by faith
[1:13:37] right but if any man draw back my soul
[1:13:41] should have no pleasure in
[1:13:43] him verse 39 said but we are not of them
[1:13:47] who draw back into predition but of them
[1:13:51] that believe to the saving of the Soul
[1:13:55] so so so God God is saying right here
[1:13:57] he's not pleased when you when when you
[1:14:00] draw back from the faith that's exactly
[1:14:02] right he's not
[1:14:04] pleased and we and we want to go on and
[1:14:07] go to Hebrews 11
[1:14:09] And1
[1:14:11] Wonder Hebrews 11
[1:14:17] And1 say now Faith is the substance of
[1:14:21] things hoped for yes sir and it's the
[1:14:24] evidence of things not seen
[1:14:30] right so this is this this is your
[1:14:35] evidence this this faith is the only
[1:14:38] thing that that you have as
[1:14:41] evidence that proves that you
[1:14:44] believe that it's going to come to
[1:14:47] pass that there there's not anything
[1:14:49] else that you can put in that spot right
[1:14:51] there am there there's nothing that you
[1:14:53] can do that shows evidence of something
[1:14:54] that you haven't received yet it takes
[1:14:56] Faith to stick right there that's the
[1:14:58] only proof that you can have this is
[1:15:01] what God is
[1:15:03] saying and we want to go to uh Hebrews
[1:15:07] 11 verse
[1:15:09] 5 it says by faith yes sir Enoch was
[1:15:13] translated that he should not see
[1:15:16] death and he was not found because God
[1:15:19] has translated him for before his
[1:15:23] translation he had
[1:15:25] this
[1:15:27] testimony that he pleased
[1:15:32] God yes
[1:15:34] sir what is this testimony Enoch
[1:15:37] had Enoch was looking for a Rapture uhuh
[1:15:41] and he belied it was coming that's the
[1:15:43] reason he went walking every day went
[1:15:44] walking down King's Highway cuz he
[1:15:47] believed that the Rapture was coming
[1:15:49] right so a testimony by faith yes sir
[1:15:53] when you testify by faith right and and
[1:15:56] the about and I'm going to get to this
[1:15:57] in a minute but the Bible said without
[1:15:59] faith without works faith is
[1:16:02] dead with no works is dead so that mean
[1:16:05] you got to do
[1:16:07] something so so it's requiring you to do
[1:16:10] something and I know sometimes we sit
[1:16:13] back and have and believe oh God just
[1:16:14] going to deliver me but God say he's not
[1:16:16] pleasing unless you
[1:16:18] testify go God say he is pleased when
[1:16:21] you testify
[1:16:23] before before your
[1:16:27] deliverance he say remember me after the
[1:16:30] Deliverance he said but you testify
[1:16:32] before the
[1:16:34] Deliverance he said in in in in this
[1:16:37] testimony before before you get
[1:16:39] delivered I am
[1:16:45] pleased in verse six in verse six says
[1:16:48] this it said but without faith it is
[1:16:50] impossible to please him that's right
[1:16:53] for he that cometh to God
[1:16:56] must believe that he
[1:17:00] is so he that cometh to God yes sir must
[1:17:04] believe that he is that's right he you
[1:17:08] must believe that he is and God saying
[1:17:11] when you come to me you must believe
[1:17:13] that I am more than able to perform that
[1:17:18] which is what you
[1:17:21] need he said when you come to me you
[1:17:24] must believe that's right and he say and
[1:17:27] that he is a
[1:17:28] rewarder of them that diligently seek
[1:17:31] him so he's saying it ain't just enough
[1:17:34] for you to come to him and believe that
[1:17:37] he is who he is he said but you also
[1:17:39] must believe that he is rewarded to them
[1:17:43] that seek him so so what he's saying is
[1:17:45] you must believe that God is going to do
[1:17:47] whatever it is not just do it but he
[1:17:50] going to do it for you
[1:18:03] wonderful sir so so number one when you
[1:18:06] approach God yes sir you must believe
[1:18:08] that he he is who he say he is that he's
[1:18:12] able to give you able to perform he able
[1:18:15] to back his word up and then after that
[1:18:18] number two you got to believe that he
[1:18:20] going to do that for
[1:18:21] you see and see that makes it personal
[1:18:24] that he going to do it for me so so now
[1:18:27] that's when that genuine Faith ks in so
[1:18:29] so if if that's why it's important to
[1:18:32] know that you are
[1:18:34] God cuz this here is the foundation of
[1:18:37] of the rest of the thing if you don't
[1:18:38] believe you God you can't take hold to
[1:18:40] that genuine Faith you first got to
[1:18:43] believe that you a God so so then you
[1:18:46] believe that God going to do it for you
[1:18:48] why he going to do it for you because
[1:18:50] you are God
[1:18:54] [Music]
[1:19:03] amen we talking about gen the Believers
[1:19:06] possess that genuine Faith yes my
[1:19:09] brother that that that unwavering faith
[1:19:12] that that faith that bring all things to
[1:19:14] pass you you always get results there
[1:19:17] there's no
[1:19:18] guessing this is is th sayith the
[1:19:23] Lord am am
[1:19:30] and Jesus said I do nothing unto the
[1:19:32] father show me that's it and then and
[1:19:34] then in one verse he said my words are
[1:19:36] not my words so he he said my words are
[1:19:40] not my words and I do nothing until the
[1:19:42] father show me so so basically if his
[1:19:45] words is not his word then who words are
[1:19:47] they so it's God talking to
[1:19:49] God that's exactly what going on it's
[1:19:51] God talking to
[1:19:53] God so so so if you catch the Revelation
[1:19:56] that you are God so so when you go talk
[1:19:59] to God so now you know that it's God
[1:20:02] talking to
[1:20:03] God you you see what I'm saying You must
[1:20:06] believe that ye are
[1:20:08] God so then you won't struggle did no
[1:20:11] wonder Jesus say father you always hear
[1:20:14] me when I
[1:20:15] pray because Jesus Jesus know he was
[1:20:21] God if you if you take butter Charles
[1:20:23] and stick him in the room by himself and
[1:20:25] he begin to talk to
[1:20:27] himself brother Charles begin to talk to
[1:20:29] himself he going to always hear Brother
[1:20:32] Charles he going to always hear Brother
[1:20:35] Charles why because but Charles is the
[1:20:37] one talking so Jesus knew he was God so
[1:20:41] whenever he approach God he know God
[1:20:43] always heard him because this his words
[1:20:47] wasen his words it was God talking
[1:20:49] through him so it was God talking back
[1:20:51] to God you don't think God hear himself
[1:20:54] talking
[1:20:55] so God is talking to God he always hear
[1:20:59] himself
[1:21:00] talking so you must believe that you are
[1:21:03] God's tonight so you won't struggle When
[1:21:06] you pray you won't struggle when you
[1:21:09] approach God you know every prayer is
[1:21:11] going through because it's God talking
[1:21:14] to
[1:21:15] [Applause]
[1:21:19] [Music]
[1:21:22] God but B say how you going to take
[1:21:24] Rapture you don't have enough faith for
[1:21:26] Divine Healing you must have faith in a
[1:21:29] Rapture you got to believe that you
[1:21:32] [Music]
[1:21:34] [Applause]
[1:21:34] [Music]
[1:21:36] [Applause]
[1:21:36] [Music]
[1:21:43] God that's why Jesus was so
[1:21:46] boldly he didn't worry about nothing he
[1:21:48] was he he was calm because he had dust
[1:21:51] say the Lord and and and and if and if
[1:21:53] he didn't see he waited on the
[1:21:56] vision he tered he waited on it he
[1:21:59] waited till the vision came once he got
[1:22:00] hold of the
[1:22:02] vision once he got a hold of the vision
[1:22:05] the devil couldn't do nothing else with
[1:22:07] him because he already seen it and he
[1:22:09] knew it was going to come to
[1:22:12] pass and and and think about I'm
[1:22:14] thinking about Lazar right now when they
[1:22:17] when they came to Jesus um they tell him
[1:22:20] Lazarus was
[1:22:22] sick he wasn't dead yet that's right
[1:22:25] when when he first got the message they
[1:22:26] told him your friend is sick take your
[1:22:28] time he is sick take your time but
[1:22:31] brother Brown said he believed God
[1:22:34] showed him a vision he said he seen
[1:22:37] Lazarus he said but it didn't go then
[1:22:39] but the vision was raising him from the
[1:22:41] [Applause]
[1:22:43] dead he couldn't go
[1:22:46] there God God sent him somewhere else to
[1:22:48] do another work because Jesus had saw
[1:22:51] the vision he raised him from the dead
[1:22:53] so Jesus say I'll just go over here
[1:22:55] until he take place till he die to the
[1:22:57] vision fulfilled he got to wait on the
[1:22:59] vision to fulfill and then he turned
[1:23:02] around and say I think I'll go wake
[1:23:03] Lazarus because Jesus has seen brother B
[1:23:06] say he seen the vision when he noticed
[1:23:09] that Lazarus had already passed then he
[1:23:11] went that way now all things are in
[1:23:15] place now all things are in
[1:23:18] place see that that's why God don't come
[1:23:21] when you want
[1:23:22] him that's why he don't come when you
[1:23:24] want
[1:23:26] him if he come when you want
[1:23:29] him it'll throw the vision
[1:23:34] off if he if he come when you want him
[1:23:36] to come it will throw the vision off
[1:23:39] it'll mess the vision up but he's always
[1:23:41] on
[1:23:42] time you might be going through
[1:23:44] something right now you might be facing
[1:23:46] a test you might be facing a trial he
[1:23:50] ain't showed up yet but just wait have
[1:23:54] faith because it ain't time yet if he
[1:23:57] come rescue you now he rescue you now
[1:23:59] he'll break the
[1:24:02] [Applause]
[1:24:03] vision so so so whatever it is between
[1:24:07] that time frame that you want God to
[1:24:09] come on the scene right now and between
[1:24:12] the time that he get there there's
[1:24:14] something that he want you to get out of
[1:24:15] that period of
[1:24:17] [Music]
[1:24:18] [Applause]
[1:24:19] time there's something he want you to
[1:24:21] get out of that period of time come it's
[1:24:25] it's something that you don't know about
[1:24:26] it but it's something that he want you
[1:24:27] to get out of that period of time and
[1:24:30] and it might be just a simple things or
[1:24:32] just raising Faith or raising your faith
[1:24:34] level as an individual within yourself
[1:25:05] hallu and Enoch had a testimony by
[1:25:09] faith and and and God and God is plainly
[1:25:13] stating in his word say this is the only
[1:25:16] way for you to please
[1:25:20] me I I I like I like when you testify
[1:25:23] after you receive receive it God is
[1:25:25] saying I love when when you make mention
[1:25:28] of me showing what I did for you he said
[1:25:30] but it pleases me when you testify of
[1:25:34] me
[1:25:36] [Applause]
[1:25:39] beforehand he he say this is what
[1:25:41] pleases
[1:25:42] me and he say if you don't if you don't
[1:25:45] do it this way I'm not pleased
[1:25:50] [Applause]
[1:25:54] [Music]
[1:26:00] in the message faith is the
[1:26:02] [Music]
[1:26:07] substance we're going to get we're going
[1:26:08] to get
[1:26:11] somewhere we're going to get
[1:26:14] somewhere faith is the
[1:26:16] substance
[1:26:18] 1947 it said faith we got to get in such
[1:26:21] a place till we be translated like Enoch
[1:26:25] was that's right Faith testimony that it
[1:26:30] pleased God did not Enoch or following
[1:26:34] scripture said that Enoch had a
[1:26:35] testimony right by faith that he pleased
[1:26:38] God uhhuh is that right right and the
[1:26:41] Bible said without faith is impossible
[1:26:43] to please God that's right so you got to
[1:26:45] have that same kind of faith that you
[1:26:48] believe and
[1:26:50] [Applause]

[1:34:28] testify now watch this
[1:34:31] testimony if if you know if you if you
[1:34:34] look at this
[1:34:36] testimony when when the when the butler
[1:34:38] begin to
[1:34:39] testify his his testimony wasn't about
[1:34:46] [Music]
[1:34:47] himself not not one time did he tell
[1:34:50] Pharaoh what he could
[1:34:52] do his testimony was not about himself
[1:34:56] but his testimony was about what Joseph
[1:34:59] could
[1:35:00] [Music]
[1:35:02] do Joseph taught
[1:35:04] [Music]
[1:35:05] [Applause]
[1:35:08] Christ so so he began to talk about what
[1:35:11] what Joseph was able to do when I was
[1:35:13] locked up Joseph was able to interpret
[1:35:15] this dream to me and and and by faith he
[1:35:20] had Faith to believe that Joseph was
[1:35:22] able to come and interpret the dream for
[1:35:24] cuz he was taking a chance so just
[1:35:26] because he interpreted his Dre don't
[1:35:28] mean he could interpret his but he had
[1:35:31] faith and
[1:35:34] Joseph cuz cuz he had a he had a walk a
[1:35:37] top he had a walk a Top Line he just
[1:35:39] came out of prison so he didn't want to
[1:35:41] mess up anymore but he had enough faith
[1:35:44] in
[1:35:45] Joseph to believe that if I tell Pharaoh
[1:35:48] that Joseph is able I believe that
[1:35:51] Joseph can
[1:35:52] perform and and and and that's what God
[1:35:54] is saying You must come to me you must
[1:35:56] believe that I'm able to perform that
[1:35:59] which is is what you
[1:36:01] want and that I'm going to do it for
[1:36:08] you oh
[1:36:11] man and think about the woman with the
[1:36:13] issue of
[1:36:15] blood and and we know her condition we
[1:36:18] know what her condition was yes sir she
[1:36:21] went 12 years with with this condition
[1:36:24] and and and they talk about her story
[1:36:26] how she she spent all her money she went
[1:36:28] to all kind of doctors
[1:36:30] and but but but some some kind of way
[1:36:33] after 12 years she developed up enough
[1:36:37] faith that if I can touch the H of His
[1:36:40] Garment and and and and that's what she
[1:36:42] had faith in and and and her testimony
[1:36:46] if you want to know her testimony was
[1:36:48] her testimony was when she
[1:36:51] pressed her way through the crowd get to
[1:36:53] him the Bible say without works is dead
[1:36:57] so what are what are you doing tonight
[1:36:59] that says that you believe that God's
[1:37:01] going to can perform what are you
[1:37:04] doing what what what are you doing what
[1:37:07] are you putting in AC and what kind of
[1:37:08] works are you putting in action that PS
[1:37:10] that that that tells God that he's
[1:37:13] able so and the prophet of God talks
[1:37:16] about it I can't I can't get into it but
[1:37:18] I'm I'm just going to tell it like this
[1:37:20] he talked about how she pressed her way
[1:37:22] through the crowd and and and this woman
[1:37:24] was an
[1:37:25] outcast she was the outcast to the
[1:37:27] economy she wasn't supposed to be around
[1:37:29] nobody but she she risk her life and
[1:37:33] pressed her way to get to that garment
[1:37:35] because she had faith that if I could
[1:37:37] touch to him with that garment I was
[1:37:39] going to be made
[1:37:40] whole and and and you got to put her
[1:37:42] shoes on but but B say she came low say
[1:37:46] she came real low he said she was so low
[1:37:48] every now and then she would pop her
[1:37:50] head up to see how far she had to go he
[1:37:52] said then she would get down and she but
[1:37:53] go real low matter of fact when she when
[1:37:57] Jesus came when Jesus came through uhhuh
[1:38:00] if you know the story yes he was
[1:38:02] actually on his way to jarus house yes
[1:38:05] cuz jar jarus had just left him and told
[1:38:08] him that his daughter was sit right he
[1:38:10] was on his way to Jerry's house but in
[1:38:14] the midst of him going there she slipped
[1:38:19] in by faith and touched the him of His
[1:38:22] Garment
[1:38:24] so so that's why that's why the Bible
[1:38:26] said don't neglect to assemble
[1:38:27] yourselves in the house because because
[1:38:30] you might not have enough Faith to bring
[1:38:31] God
[1:38:33] down but but out of all the people in
[1:38:36] here it only take one of y'all to bring
[1:38:38] them down if you can get him down then I
[1:38:42] can touch him right here I can touch him
[1:38:46] I can
[1:38:48] touch this is the best place you can be
[1:38:51] right
[1:38:52] here and The House of the Believers yes
[1:38:55] sir look how many chances you got in
[1:38:56] here to bring God down look around look
[1:38:59] around so many chances it don't take but
[1:39:02] one to bring him down so if I'm coming
[1:39:04] to here and I'm weak and I ain't able to
[1:39:07] quiet bring him down if if but self got
[1:39:09] enough Faith this service this service
[1:39:11] right here to bring him down then I'm
[1:39:13] pleased with that long as he in the
[1:39:15] building then I can get what I
[1:39:17] [Applause]
[1:39:17] [Music]
[1:39:21] need and and she had so much Faith she
[1:39:25] only had faith in Touching to him with
[1:39:27] that garment but brother brand say when
[1:39:29] she when she touched that garment say
[1:39:31] she turned around he saying she went
[1:39:33] back in the crowd that's it so so that
[1:39:36] told me this woman had no intentions of
[1:39:39] having a conversation with
[1:39:41] Jesus she had no intentions of talking
[1:39:44] to him having no conversation her faith
[1:39:47] was If I Could Touch to him with that
[1:39:49] garment and I could be made whole
[1:39:53] and that what she had faith in that what
[1:39:55] she
[1:39:56] received but her testimony she pressed
[1:39:59] away to get there cuz she believed that
[1:40:00] she got there it was going to be
[1:40:08] done in the shite woman she had she had
[1:40:11] Faith she had Faith yes sir the prophet
[1:40:15] gave her a son prayed for her to get a
[1:40:17] son and then he
[1:40:19] died but when she she wanted to go see
[1:40:22] the prophet about why he
[1:40:24] died and and and if you know the story I
[1:40:27] can't read it all if you know the
[1:40:30] story when she was getting ready to go
[1:40:33] to the get the
[1:40:34] prophet her husband say why why are you
[1:40:37] going up there say he's not there that's
[1:40:40] what her husband told her he said he's
[1:40:42] not there he say it's neither new moon
[1:40:44] or the Sabbath say he's not there so
[1:40:47] there was particular times when Elijah
[1:40:50] would be on MAR karma when he would
[1:40:52] consecrate himself
[1:40:54] but she had enough Faith that's it that
[1:40:56] she was going there and that he was
[1:40:58] going to be there that's it and surely
[1:41:00] when she got that he was there that's
[1:41:02] right he was there and he said the Lord
[1:41:05] had hid this for me he said the Lord
[1:41:07] don't reveal Everything To His prophets
[1:41:09] that's right and he didn't know what was
[1:41:11] her problem but what I'm saying is her
[1:41:13] faith caused him to be at a place that
[1:41:16] he normally wouldn't
[1:41:17] be just like the but B say the suite
[1:41:20] woman held that plane down it was her f
[1:41:23] that held that
[1:41:25] plane and you you you got to have faith
[1:41:28] in
[1:41:29] something and her faith was in the
[1:41:31] prophet because he tried to send his
[1:41:34] staff down there he he told he told
[1:41:36] gazel to take my staff down there but
[1:41:39] the the woman didn't have she didn't
[1:41:40] have faith in the staff she had but B
[1:41:43] say she didn't have no faith in that
[1:41:44] staff she had faith in
[1:41:49] Elijah oh boy
[1:41:56] amen but God is
[1:41:58] pleased with that type of
[1:42:04] testimony sir and what about you and me
[1:42:08] tonight we got the fullness of God the

[1:42:20] walking in us that should be not no
[1:42:23] reason why while we struggling with
