[Music] How great thou. Almighty God. Lord, that song comes close, Lord, to what we would like to express this morning, Lord, because Lord, these are these are words, Lord, that a man wrote in a song, Lord, but our hearts cannot find words, Lord, to express, Lord, the love and the gratitude we have for you, Lord, for where you've brought us to, Lord God. But you are great, Lord. There's none other like you at all. Lord God, we come into your house this morning, Lord. First of all, Lord, thanking you, Father. We come to worship your name, Lord. We come to praise your name, Lord. We come to lift your name up and exalt you, Lord, above everything in heaven and on earth. Lord, we ask that you come and have your will once again, Lord God, in our lives for the message, Lord, of the hour that you've given us, Lord. how thankful we are, Lord God, for this. No doubt this same song is probably being sung in denominational churches around the world this morning, Lord God. But Lord, it's special to us, Lord. It's special, Lord, because you've opened the book up to us, Lord. The seven seals and the thunders, Lord, have all been sounded, Lord. And we're thankful, Father, that we've received these things, Lord. Lord, if there's anyone that's struggling with anything, Lord, open their eyes this morning, Lord God, and let them see. Let them see with new sight, Lord, that which you've done for us, Lord. We thank you, Father. We thank you, Lord. Bless our musicians this morning, Lord God. Bless our singers, Lord. Our technicians this morning, Lord God. Bless our deacons, Lord, our trustee, our treasurer, Lord, all the officers, Lord. come and bless your congregation this morning, Lord God. It's good to see, Lord, those that are coming in, Lord, be with those that are still on the road, Lord. We understand there was an accident in someone's path, Lord, but they made it, Lord. And that's We thank you, Father. We thank you, Lord. But I want to ask Lord God, Lord, if I'm guilty of some kind of a time complex that's being put on the pastor, Lord, we don't need to be under a time limit here, Lord God. We don't need for him to stand behind this desk, Lord, and to feel pressure, Lord, that he needs to shut it down before you finish what you have to say, Lord God. So we want to yield ourselves, Lord, individually and as a congregation, Lord, to let you and him have your liberty, Lord God. That's what we're here for. It doesn't matter, Lord, if we're here till 4 or 5:00, Lord God. We got nothing better to do and no place to be, Lord. Some of us could stand missing a meal anyway. Amen. Praise God. I know I could, Lord. I'm just asking for help, Lord. So, keep that devil off of us, Lord. We don't want it to come up here, Lord, and get on our pastor, Lord. Lord, the gift that you've given us deserves time to express itself, Lord. For we know it's not him, Lord. It's the Holy Spirit. So strengthen him before he even comes out here, Lord, to withstand anything that might come against this pulpit, Lord, while he's preaching. We just sometimes need to leave the doors open so those demons can leave. Bless your congregation this morning, Lord God. We're going to sing some songs, Lord. Some about the rapture, Lord. That's what's on our heart, Lord, is getting out of here. So bless each one here, Lord. These are precious souls, Lord God, sitting here. We've endured quite a bit in our lives for the gospel's sake, but not for our reward, Lord, for your glory. It's as simple as that. We thank you for opening our eyes, Lord. We're asking for an extraordinary service this morning, Lord. a supernatural service, a supernatural vindication this morning. Lord, may your power come down. We realize we're living in the days of the spoken word, Lord. We need to be careful what comes out of our mouths, good or bad, Lord. We are in that time, Lord. And we need to be responsible for those things that you've showed us, Lord, and be wise, Lord, and careful, Lord. to give you glory and not to bring reproach as well. Lord, we thank you, Father. Bless each one once again. Bless our pastor, Lord. Please meet with him while we sing, Lord, in the front. Lord, we thank you for what you're doing here with the building. Lord, we just ask that you continue to have your will, Lord, in Jesus Christ's name, we ask all these things, Lord. Amen and amen and amen. Praise God. Let's give him a clap offering this morning. Can we do that? Turn around and greet your neighbor. Amen. Welcome to the house of the Lord. Amen. Very good. [Music] Well, this world is not my home. I'm just a passing fruit. My treasures are laid up somewhere beyond the blue. But the angels begging me from heaven's open door. And I can't feel at home in this world anymore. Well, oh Lord, you know I have no friend like you. If heaven's not my home, then Lord, what will I do? Well, he ain't so thanking me from heaven's open door. And I can't feel at home in this world anymore. [Music] They're all expecting me. And that's one thing I know. Well, I fixed it up with Jesus so many years ago. And I know he'll see me through. Oh, I am weak and poor. And I can't feel at home in this world anymore. [Music] So Lord, you know I have no friend like you. If heaven's not my home, then Lord, what will I do? Well, the angels don't be back in me from heaven's open door. And I can't feel I in this world anymore. Just over in that glory land will live eternally. The saints on every hand are shouting victory for their songs of sweetest praise back from heaven shore. And I can't feel at all in this world anymore. Now, oh Lord, you know I have no friend like you. If heaven's not my home, then Lord, what will I do? Well, the angels beckon me from heaven's open door. And I can't feel at home in this world anymore. Well, some glad morning we shall see. Jesus in the air, coming after you and me. Joy is ours to share. What rejoicing there will be when the saints shall rise headed for that jubilee thunder in the sky. Oh singing and all shouting on that happy morning when we all shall rise. Oh what glory hallelujah. Win our blessed savior in the sky. Seems that now I almost see all the savior there rising for that jubilee that is just a hand in the twinkling of an eye change with them to be. All the living saints comply to that jubilee. Oh, what singing and no one shouting on that happy morning when we all shall rise. Oh, what glory. Hallelujah. [Music] When we meet our blessed savior in the sky. &gt;&gt; Now when with all that heavenly host we begin to sing. Singing in the Holy Ghost how the heavens will rain. Millions there will join the song. With them we shall be praising Christ through ages long. Heaven's jubilee. Oh no singing and no one shouting on that happy morning when we all shall rise. Oh what glory hallelujah when we meet our blessed savior in the skies. No one singing and no one shouting on that happy morning when we all shall rise. Oh what glory hallelujah when we meet our blessed savior in the sky. [Music] Woo. Can y'all imagine? Can y'all imagine that? Hallelujah. [Music] You know, we're still in mortal bodies and we singing and it feels good to sing for God like this. &gt;&gt; Could you imagine? &gt;&gt; Oh my goodness. [Music] &gt;&gt; Oh, I want to see him look upon &gt;&gt; that beautiful, wonderful face there. to sing forever of that amazing grace &gt;&gt; on the streets of glory. Let me lift my voice. [Music] My cares all pass. Oh, [Applause] ever to rejoice. And oh, I want to see him. Just look upon that face &gt;&gt; there to sing forever of his amazing grace on those streets of glory. Just let me lift my voice. My cares all past. We're home at last. Heaven to rejoice. &gt;&gt; Let's give him another clap offering. Amen. Hallelujah. Y'all can be seated.

Our cood book, our church ages, 70 weeks of Daniel, the seals, adoption, or somebody is listening to the message of the hour. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I prepare everything and when I put a message last night and begin to go to sleep and the message begin to play and I begin to have new coats, I had to wake up this morning and take those coat and put it in. So, it's always important to stay and listen to the voice of the messenger. &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Glenn got the venue secure for question and answer. That will be October the 11th. It's a Saturday. You can put it down. Our next question and answer will be October the 20 uh October the 11th, meaning this is the last one for the year. Then the next one will be next year if the Lord carries. And our young men meeting for part three. I have not gotten a date yet. Brother Tony, if you can deal with the young man and then come up with a date, that would be great, please. and married couple meetings, Lord's willing, it's September the 20th for part seven and December the 13th for part eight and young sisters meeting it's September the 27th we will go like a question and answer session the building project you see how everything is moving I'm still dealing with uh the previous work that has been done so I'm paying bills and then once I'm done with paying all those bills then we start building up for the foundation of the fellowship hall. So just be uh in prayer, do what you can do and then whatever is coming up whether you start building fund or offering we just paying the bills of the work that has been done and trying to make sure everything is clean up so we can move on the next session. But God is a God of miracle &gt;&gt; and he can do the impossible. Amen. &gt;&gt; So there are things that have been put there. There are equipment there. So I know we want to go there and see. So just uh be very cautious and give us some time. We need to do work there. We got equipment that have been put there. So whatever you already seen, you already seen a lot. So at this point until unless you are authorized personnel or somebody or you have the trustee or someone with you, fine. But if it's not there are stuff there, especially children, make sure somebody's there or just avoid. And also I know we are in uh in the time where our privacy uh lesson are going on. Our notions of privacy are going on. People are taking pictures in the uh bathroom, pictures in the living room, picture in the bedroom. We take picture everywhere and we post it everywhere. So refrain from taking pictures over there. Amen. &gt;&gt; I don't like it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Ah, thank you. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So don't go there and begin to record stuff and go post it. That's against the privacy of the church. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So don't go there and take picture. You say, "No, I'm going to show my friend how our song leader uh office look like." Uhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhuh. Uhuh. Please don't do that. Don't go record. Uh post your own uh house. This is the house of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? Post yourself. Your own house, your own car. No problem. That's you and the Lord. But now go there and start uh I mean uh recording our sink and record. Hey, please. &gt;&gt; If you work here, just avoid that. If you are here part of the church, just avoid that. You can see fine, but I'm not somebody to be taking pictures and posting that online and everybody see that. I don't believe in that. That's just me. I don't believe in that. So, respect the privacy of the church. That's why I tell the camera I focus on here and leave the congregation alone. If you want to see who's in spoken word, you travel. You come here and you come and see the people of spoken word. Amen. Amen. Yeah, I've seen churches where camera going in the congregation and sometimes somebody's uh uh slumbering and uh and uh sleeping and everything and you see people on a big screen. Come on. So, let's let's avoid that one. Let's focus right here and deal with what is going on there. Let's keep the privacy of the church. Somebody asked the meeting about the married couple meetings and the other meeting. It's hard for me to put them online because of the way the setting and the way we approached them. It was married people. We took all the gloves off. We sat down and talk plainly. So I cannot take it and put it online. I know how message believer are and I know how many gun turn toward me because they're looking for one thing and then they shoot. So I cannot give you an opportunity to say well that meeting was supposed to be private and why did you put it on YouTube? I already know all of that. That's why I don't put it on YouTube. I've been in the message a little bit around. Amen. So you want to see the meeting? Pray God to give you a visa, travel over here and we meet one another. We sit we will put the meeting together and everything will be okay. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Have I say something wrong? &gt;&gt; No sir. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Okay. because I don't want to see faces going on now. I know what I'm talking about. You can say I'm sorry, but the video is already there. &gt;&gt; Uh you can tell me I'm sorry, brother Steven. I didn't know, but the video is already there. And whoever put it, if they don't want to remove it, it's going to stay there. So I know message believer. I've been around message believer. I study message believer. So I know how it is. So you want to come in the meeting, let us know. Come talk to your pastor. Come. welcome to the meeting. We can share with you but certain things it's hard unless if I'm say there is a convention for married couple meeting I need to talk to everybody then I'm using a different weapon and to know what I'm doing because every time you're trying to help people they will you will see one who's trying to to block the blessing and try to come in a legalistic way and usually they the one that struggle &gt;&gt; that's right &gt;&gt; and they don't want to be disclosed. Mhm. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And they don't want anything to do with it, but they are struggling. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And when you face them, then you realize they they are more struggling than even the people who want it. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So avoid recording the building. See it with your own eyes and we move on. Are we clear? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Lord's willing at the end of the service we will have water baptism and I send you quote in the church group chat about the pictures. of Offman and for some reason I didn't uh I never uh caught it until I put the quote together that brother Brandham say he didn't like Salsman picture. &gt;&gt; Okay, I leave it. You go back again and you read the quote. Okay, go back again and read the quote. I thought I highlighted for you but I thought you ced. Okay, I'm not going to say anything. You will go back and read the quote. I put like four or five code, read it slowly and read what brother Brandham said because I usually wonder what that picture was. I saw Catholic using that picture. &gt;&gt; Exactly. Right. &gt;&gt; And I didn't know why and until I read and brother Brandham say I don't like uh uh Solsman picture. I like Offman because that's the way I saw him. So before I say what I want to say, you go back and review the quote. Then if you can remind me next Sunday, then I'll tell you what to do. But as for this church, this is the picture we keep. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Are we together? Amen. &gt;&gt; And this picture was confirmed by the clouds. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, if I want to have a picture of Christ in my house, &gt;&gt; this is the one I keep. &gt;&gt; I even gave you a quote. Brother Brandham say when he prayed, &gt;&gt; he he he positioned himself so that the picture of of man is looking at him. Go see the church group. Amen. &gt;&gt; I saw you doing heart and this and this and and I thought you read &gt;&gt; and I verify everybody that read. This is your pastor. I click and I then I verify everybody that read. &gt;&gt; Even Even if you didn't do this, I verify you &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So go back and review the code &gt;&gt; and go see. But as of me and this church and my house, &gt;&gt; that's right, brother. This is the picture we keep. &gt;&gt; Keep this in mind because when you see him &gt;&gt; this is the way he will look like. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Okay. There is one thing that I forgot last Sunday &gt;&gt; that I'm trying to put it then we can start our reading of the scripture. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; You okay with it? &gt;&gt; Can I read it to you? &gt;&gt; Yeah. It was when we were with me and I forgot. I put you mean have seven letters. &gt;&gt; That one you already understand. &gt;&gt; There was something the Holy Spirit pricked to me. I thought I'm going to use it this Sunday, but the direction went differently. If you can go to the book of Daniel quick and then we will go. I just want to make sure this is settled. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Daniel 6 verse 8. If you're there, you can say amen. &gt;&gt; If you move quickly so we can go back to our scripture. You there? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You slept well. &gt;&gt; Amen. Uh verse eight, the Bible says, "Now, oh king," you know the story here. If I begin to get in this story, then I won't preach. So let's touch what we want to say. Now, oh king, establish the decree. This is the people that came. They knew Daniel was praying and they searched Daniel in everything. They could not catch him. They say you know what there is only one place we can catch him is that boy is strict with the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Ah this is now dropping. I was trying to avoid it. That boy is really strict with brother M with brother brandam say brother brandam say brother brandam say &gt;&gt; sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That sister is really strict with the prophet. &gt;&gt; That's the only way. Let's put a law &gt;&gt; that will go toward that place &gt;&gt; to put them in trouble. &gt;&gt; But usually you open up the third pool. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And oh king established the decree and sign the wring that it be not changed. We clear? &gt;&gt; According to the law of the Mides and what? &gt;&gt; The Persians &gt;&gt; which alterth not. In other word, this law once they make them, &gt;&gt; there is no amendment. &gt;&gt; You don't change them. &gt;&gt; They stay there forever. &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. &gt;&gt; We clear. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Job to verse uh 15. Then these men assembled to the king and say to the king, "No, O king." In other words, they're reminding the king, "Hey, you're trying to save Daniel. Hey, remember this. Know oh king that the law of the mid and Persian is that no decree no statute which the king establish may be what? &gt;&gt; Changed. &gt;&gt; So if a law is established it cannot be changed. &gt;&gt; And if the king add another law &gt;&gt; or sanction another law even the king himself &gt;&gt; can no longer change it. In other words, the new law &gt;&gt; is now part of the old law. [Music] &gt;&gt; And both laws are one. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If I lost you, you raise your hand. &gt;&gt; We clear. &gt;&gt; Let's go to Esther one. Then I finish. Thank God you're doing good today. I pray you stay like that. Oh, glory to God. Let's go to the book of Esther. Glory to God. Esther chapter 1 and drop to verse uh 19. I was going to ROF instead of Esther. &gt;&gt; Give me a minute so we can get this and uh move clearly. Esther 1 verse 19. If you dare, you can say amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Verse 19. Remember this is Meukan who's speaking the seventh one, right? &gt;&gt; On the seventh day, right? &gt;&gt; Amen. The last day of the feast, &gt;&gt; the seventh chamberlain, I mean prince, who was the seventh one, &gt;&gt; the last one, the wise one, &gt;&gt; the one who knew time. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; The one who introduced the season. That's right. &gt;&gt; The one who preached marriage and divorce. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; We clear, right? &gt;&gt; This is Meukan who's talking. Verse 19, he said, "If he pleased the king, remember Esther, &gt;&gt; right? Let there go a royal commandment from him. &gt;&gt; It is not the king talking. It is mean who's talking. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The commandment will come from the king, &gt;&gt; but the one who talking &gt;&gt; is meukan. &gt;&gt; In other words, it looks like Meukan is putting the commandment in the mouth of the king. &gt;&gt; That's correct, brother. &gt;&gt; We clear? Okay. So, there is an echo between Meukan and the king. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; The word echo. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We clear. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's me. Be careful. It's the king. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; I will try to preach what I want to preach today. Amen. If he please the king, let there go a royal commandment from him and let it be written among the what? &gt;&gt; The laws &gt;&gt; of what? &gt;&gt; The Persians &gt;&gt; and the water &gt;&gt; and the means. &gt;&gt; So whatever is going to come out of Mo of Mean, &gt;&gt; come on, brother. &gt;&gt; Will be incorporated into the law. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I don't know if we together. &gt;&gt; The law already existed. Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; We clear. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But there is something that is coming from the month of Meukan. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; We clear. &gt;&gt; And whatever is coming from the month of Meukan is going to be incorporated to the law. &gt;&gt; That's exactly right. Amen. &gt;&gt; In other words, what Meukan is saying is going to have the same value &gt;&gt; and the same authority &gt;&gt; as the law that already existed. &gt;&gt; In other word, once what muan say is sealed, &gt;&gt; you cannot separate the law &gt;&gt; from what mean has said. Yes sir. &gt;&gt; In other words, the law and what Meukan is saying become one. &gt;&gt; And if you cannot change the law, &gt;&gt; you cannot change what Meukan is saying. &gt;&gt; In other words, the same respect that was given to the law. &gt;&gt; That respect now is put on the word of Meukan. In other word, the same respect that was put on the Bible. Come on, brother. Come on, brother. &gt;&gt; Is going to be put on the message of Yahweh. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Just like he have, you cannot add anything &gt;&gt; or retrieve anything from the Bible. You cannot add anything to the message and nor remove anything because the message have the same sanction as the Bible. &gt;&gt; That's exactly right. &gt;&gt; In other words, the message and the Bible are one. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Come on, Lord. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; That's the reason why we repeat brother Brown on the pulpit. &gt;&gt; Exactly. Amen. Because we are not repeating the word of a man. &gt;&gt; We are repeating the word of God. &gt;&gt; We are repeating the commandment of the king. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Why do we read the message on the pulpit? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Somebody even say that could be a 23rd chapter. And brother Brandham come he said no no no he was already inside there. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; In plain word this message &gt;&gt; is nothing but the Bible. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; The way you respect the Bible, you respect the message. &gt;&gt; The way you respect what the Bible say. That's the way we respect what brother Brandham says. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; If you say brother Brandham say here and here, he says here, I can go in the Bible and show you the same thing. &gt;&gt; The Bible say here two people. The Bible say here one person. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's why it's easy for that to slide into the laws of mission and Persia. &gt;&gt; We clear? &gt;&gt; Amen. And that message have to be interpreted in every language &gt;&gt; and sent in every tongue. &gt;&gt; The message that was going on all over the world to every tongue and language was actually the word of &gt;&gt; Meukan. That's exactly right. &gt;&gt; So it's the word of Meukan that are going to Africa &gt;&gt; to India to South America collecting the virgin. That's right. &gt;&gt; Collecting the virgin all over the world and bringing them together to the palace. &gt;&gt; It's a message that is collecting the bride &gt;&gt; all over the world to bring the bride back together. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We clear on that one. &gt;&gt; Amen. So whoever was struggling with the message and the Bible and the message and the Bible and the message and the Bible, they already reading the Bible, then they read again the message. We are reading the word of &gt;&gt; Meanana &gt;&gt; because it's the law of the present time. &gt;&gt; It's the law of the season. &gt;&gt; It is the message of Yahweh, &gt;&gt; the message of the season. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? Amen. So be careful how you play with the message. &gt;&gt; So when the message say you should never marry an unbeliever, &gt;&gt; it is the same as the Bible who says that. &gt;&gt; When brother Brandham say you only marry somebody that look like you &gt;&gt; only marry a message believer &gt;&gt; that is filled with the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; Anyone against that is enter message. &gt;&gt; Can I hear an amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Whatever brother Brandham say, we stick with it. &gt;&gt; Because when you believe the prophet, &gt;&gt; you obey the prophet, then you will prosper. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When brother say something, &gt;&gt; I'm not going to move. &gt;&gt; I'm not going to even waver. I am not going to even negotiate &gt;&gt; because God vindicated and sanctioned the message. [Music] &gt;&gt; I don't know why you struggling. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What you reading in the Bible, it's Moses who saved. &gt;&gt; What you read in the Bible, it is Paul who saved. What you read in the Bible? What you read in the Bible? It is Matthew who said &gt;&gt; it is John who said it is the same brother saying [Music] [Applause] &gt;&gt; Elijah a man of light passion. Yes brother a man of light passion. But when they spoke they spoke under the Holy Ghost. Yes. &gt;&gt; That's why they say this is thus sayith the Lord. &gt;&gt; In other words, it's not me. It is God inspiring me to speak. &gt;&gt; So when the prophet says stick behind it and anything against the prophet, I will not support you. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; You didn't hear me well. &gt;&gt; Anything against this message, don't put me in. &gt;&gt; Don't put me. Don't call me there. I will stick with the message of the hour. [Applause] Are we together? &gt;&gt; I'm not a pastor who will compromise with you. &gt;&gt; You voted me to stand by the word. &gt;&gt; If what I'm preaching is hard, leave the musician. [Applause] &gt;&gt; If the message is too strong, don't get into the technician. &gt;&gt; Remove from the office. Because brother Brandham say we must be 100% together. &gt;&gt; 100%. &gt;&gt; I'm 100% with the message. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Most of our war is because one is going off the word &gt;&gt; then we make it personal. I don't have any problem with you personal but I stand by the word of God &gt;&gt; and I have to stand by my conviction. If I have to stand alone, I stand alone. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because the message is under the laws of nent persia, &gt;&gt; it cannot be altered. &gt;&gt; Parent, are we together? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Parent, are we together? &gt;&gt; Spoken word, are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Invisible audience, are we together? Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's give the Lord a big clap. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Flight attendant, prepare for takeoff. &gt;&gt; My subject this morning, you can stand. &gt;&gt; It's now the reading of the word. &gt;&gt; Our life journey.

[Applause] &gt;&gt; They're praying, they're fasting, and tomorrow the woman that was fasting is coming up with short Right.

Amen. &gt;&gt; The Bible says that and it came to pass when he was come near to enter Egypt that he said to Sarah his wife, "Behold, now I know &gt;&gt; that you are how? &gt;&gt; A fair woman to look upon." &gt;&gt; Beautiful like sister Cheryl. &gt;&gt; Don't worry, my friend. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. When he was in the promised land, the beauty of sister Sharon was not a problem. &gt;&gt; Oh, sorry. The beauty of Sarah was not a problem. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Come on, brother. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Now that he's going to Egypt, something that was normal &gt;&gt; over there begin to be a problem over there. &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All this time you didn't see that Sarah was beautiful. &gt;&gt; Only now. &gt;&gt; Honey, you know you good. You I'm very beautiful. &gt;&gt; Yes, honey. Thank you. I appreciate it. That's not really the point. I thought you were giving me compliment. No, &gt;&gt; you know where we going. &gt;&gt; We're going among unbelievers. &gt;&gt; When you were leaving, you didn't know where you were going. &gt;&gt; When you were leaving, you didn't know where you were going. You didn't know you were going to Egypt. &gt;&gt; Playing games. Amen. &gt;&gt; He says that he said to Sarah, his wife, &gt;&gt; behold now I know that you are a fair woman. &gt;&gt; It's good for a man to know that his wife look beautiful. [Applause] It is good to &gt;&gt; if you say amen, we will move quickly. &gt;&gt; If not, we got problem. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Therefore, it shall come to pass when the Egyptians shall see you, &gt;&gt; that they shall say, "This is his wife, and they will kill me, but they will save you alive." &gt;&gt; It's already a risk, brother. &gt;&gt; Why you keep going? &gt;&gt; Number one, who told you to go there? &gt;&gt; Let's continue. &gt;&gt; Say, "I pray you. you are my sister &gt;&gt; which was true &gt;&gt; but in this case it was not true &gt;&gt; because him and sister were doing certain things that brother and sister don't do &gt;&gt; you fine okay &gt;&gt; amen &gt;&gt; you're fooling somebody &gt;&gt; fooling somebody &gt;&gt; if you use sister you sister all time. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I pray you are my sister that I may be well with me for your sake and my show and my soul shall live because of who? &gt;&gt; Of thee. &gt;&gt; And it came to pass that when Abraham was come to Egypt, the Egyptian beheld a woman that she was how &gt;&gt; very fair. &gt;&gt; So these Egyptian begin to see a beauty they have never seen. That's right. &gt;&gt; A message sister have entered in the wrong territory. &gt;&gt; That's correct. &gt;&gt; And she look different. &gt;&gt; They say who is this? &gt;&gt; This is not our women who their belly are hanging out. &gt;&gt; This one look holy. &gt;&gt; What are you doing in this territory? &gt;&gt; Who sent you here? Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, there is famine in there over there. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, it came to pass uh uh verse 15, the princes also of Pharaoh saw her &gt;&gt; on CNN in Egypt. A woman that came out looking beautiful going on. And the princes of of of Pharaoh saw her and commanded her before who? &gt;&gt; Pharaoh. &gt;&gt; And the woman was taken into Pharaoh house. &gt;&gt; What about if when they came they say it's a wife of somebody. Would they have taken him? &gt;&gt; They say Pharaoh, all the women you have in Egypt, &gt;&gt; you never seen this one. This one, &gt;&gt; this is your last opportunity to catch this one. &gt;&gt; Pharaoh said, "Woo! &gt;&gt; Did you record her?" &gt;&gt; Word made flesh. &gt;&gt; He said, "Yes." When she was passing, we held our telephone like this. Word made flesh. &gt;&gt; Pharaoh say, "See, let me see. &gt;&gt; Go get her. Are we together?" I'm trying to leave the airport. Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Follow me, my friend. &gt;&gt; Verse 16. This is where I'm heading. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he entreat Abraham where &gt;&gt; for who? &gt;&gt; Her sake. &gt;&gt; So Abraham begin to get privilege. &gt;&gt; There it is. &gt;&gt; From Pharaoh. &gt;&gt; The brother begin to prosper. &gt;&gt; That's it. That's it right there. I'm heading somewhere &gt;&gt; under a lie. [Music] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Hey, it looks like this move of lying &gt;&gt; is bringing money. &gt;&gt; When I was in Canaan, you see now, &gt;&gt; you see now it's working &gt;&gt; foolishly. And he intreated Abraham well for her sake. And he had what? &gt;&gt; Sheep. &gt;&gt; Let's go, my friend. So in Egypt here, nothing. &gt;&gt; In Egypt, what is happening? &gt;&gt; Sheep. &gt;&gt; Uh-huh.

Yes. &gt;&gt; And message denominational believer will say you see how God had prospered me. So what I was doing was not bad at all. &gt;&gt; Remember the rich young ruler. &gt;&gt; You will find yourself in hell. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Any question so far? &gt;&gt; No sir. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Then God came and struck Pharaoh. Pharaoh say hey call Abraham. &gt;&gt; Listen in as a case brother Brandham say Aimc taught Isaac sanctification. &gt;&gt; I have the code. So now Pharaoh is calling brother. &gt;&gt; You you told me this was a &gt;&gt; sister. &gt;&gt; What a rebuke from unbeliever. It's a shame when people outside are correcting you. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Look what Pharaoh say. Let's go to verse 20. &gt;&gt; Verse 20. And Pharaoh commanded his men concerning him. And they did what? &gt;&gt; They sent him away. &gt;&gt; And who? &gt;&gt; His wife. &gt;&gt; And what? &gt;&gt; All that he had. &gt;&gt; Did Pharaoh remove anything from Abraham? So Abraham have is living how &gt;&gt; rich &gt;&gt; rich &gt;&gt; at least they didn't kill me. You see Sarah they didn't kill me. We &gt;&gt; are moving to another state. You see what we have now the Lord. Thank you Jesus for sparing us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? So my brother left riches &gt;&gt; and this wealth &gt;&gt; is coming from a lie. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And it's a wealth of Egypt. &gt;&gt; Follow me my friend. &gt;&gt; It is not the wealth of Canaan. &gt;&gt; No sir. &gt;&gt; It is a wealth that is coming from Egypt. &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We are together. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's go to chapter 13. I told you keep your Bible. I'm reading the Bible, my friend. &gt;&gt; Chapter 13, verse one. If you dare, you can say amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And Abraham went out of what? &gt;&gt; Egypt. &gt;&gt; He and who? &gt;&gt; His wife. &gt;&gt; And what? &gt;&gt; All that he had. &gt;&gt; And Lot was with him into the water, &gt;&gt; the south. &gt;&gt; Watch verse two. And Abram was how? &gt;&gt; Very rich. &gt;&gt; Abraham was how? &gt;&gt; Very rich. &gt;&gt; Not rich. He was how? &gt;&gt; Very rich. &gt;&gt; Where did this wealth come from? &gt;&gt; Egypt. &gt;&gt; God have not finished with him yet. &gt;&gt; He was how? &gt;&gt; Very rich. &gt;&gt; And what? &gt;&gt; Very rich in what? &gt;&gt; In cattle. &gt;&gt; In what? &gt;&gt; In cattle. &gt;&gt; You see all of this, right? &gt;&gt; Very rich in what? &gt;&gt; In cattle. &gt;&gt; Very rich in cattle. And what? &gt;&gt; In silver. &gt;&gt; In silver. &gt;&gt; And what else? &gt;&gt; And in gold. &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. That's right. &gt;&gt; So brother bank account, credit card, American Express, Visa, Master Card, the brother have it. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Bank account full from Pharaoh &gt;&gt; from Pharaoh &gt;&gt; from a lie. &gt;&gt; We are together. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Job to verse five. Glory to God. I told you it's a major surgery. And Lot also which went with Abraham had what? &gt;&gt; Flocks. &gt;&gt; The brother also got a portion of it. &gt;&gt; He had water &gt;&gt; and herds &gt;&gt; and what &gt;&gt; intents &gt;&gt; and the land was not able to bear them. So they had so much &gt;&gt; but the place where they were follow me &gt;&gt; was not a good place &gt;&gt; to handle the wealth. &gt;&gt; Follow me my friend. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; To that the man dwelt together for their substance &gt;&gt; was what? &gt;&gt; Great &gt;&gt; so that they could not dwell what &gt;&gt; together. So the prosperity begin to cause problem. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; God plugged Egypt &gt;&gt; for Egypt to kick Abraham out. &gt;&gt; Abraham was kicked out. &gt;&gt; You following me? &gt;&gt; God say, "I'm going to teach this boy something." &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? When he came out, he's still rich. &gt;&gt; And they landed into a land, but the land is not too fertile &gt;&gt; enough to support their wealth. &gt;&gt; Trouble begin to stop &gt;&gt; because originally speaking, God called Abraham alone. Amen. &gt;&gt; Not Abraham with his father. &gt;&gt; Not Abraham with his mother. &gt;&gt; This work is you and God. &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; You will answer before God. Your mother will answer before God. Your father will answer with before God. Your brother before God. Everybody individually. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But Abraham pick up a lot. Amen. &gt;&gt; And the substance they got stirred the trouble. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Verse uh uh drop to verse uh 10. &gt;&gt; And Lot lift up his eyes &gt;&gt; and beheld all water &gt;&gt; the plain of Jordan &gt;&gt; that he was how &gt;&gt; well watered. &gt;&gt; Because Abraham say you go left I go right. They were well watered like water &gt;&gt; everywhere &gt;&gt; before the Lord destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah even as the water &gt;&gt; the garden of the Lord &gt;&gt; like the land of what? &gt;&gt; Egypt &gt;&gt; as you come to what? &gt;&gt; Zoe. &gt;&gt; So when Abraham say let's separate one another Lot look at the land. When he look at the land it reminded him Egypt. &gt;&gt; I'm reading is my Bible different than you? Amen. &gt;&gt; But it was an Egypt that look like the Garden of Eden. &gt;&gt; Please, let's read it again because this is different. Let's go to verse 10. Go ahead, my friend. &gt;&gt; And Lot lifted up his eyes. &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. And beheld what? &gt;&gt; All the plain of Jordan. &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. That he was how? &gt;&gt; Well watered everywhere. &gt;&gt; Good opportunity. And what? &gt;&gt; Before the Lord destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah. &gt;&gt; Ah, he didn't see Sodom and Gomorrah. Uh-huh. &gt;&gt; Lot is still looking at something else. Sodom and Gomorrah. Even as the water, &gt;&gt; the garden of the Lord, &gt;&gt; the garden of Eden, like the land of what? &gt;&gt; Egypt. &gt;&gt; As you come to water, so there was a reference &gt;&gt; like I've seen this opportunity in Egypt. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; So this is the place for me to go. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Verse uh 11. Then Lord choose him what? &gt;&gt; All the plain of Jordan. &gt;&gt; And Lot journey how? &gt;&gt; East. and they separated themselves to uh uh the one from water &gt;&gt; the other. &gt;&gt; So Lot went east and Abraham stay on the other land. &gt;&gt; Remember where Abraham stayed the land was already a problem &gt;&gt; sir &gt;&gt; to sustain the substance &gt;&gt; because the Bible say Abraham was very rich. &gt;&gt; Are we together? So Lot went where he can flourish. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. Because the land is well water is going to take care of his camel. So brother Abraham is slowly coming back to his first state. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; To a difficult environment &gt;&gt; and brother Lot move on &gt;&gt; to a well environment. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We clear my friend. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We good? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Job to verse uh 14. &gt;&gt; If you there we can say amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And the Lord said to Abraham after &gt;&gt; so God begin to clean up Abraham. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; A lot of trouble Lot off. &gt;&gt; God look he say okay Lot is off. &gt;&gt; He's no longer there. &gt;&gt; Nobody else over there. Okay. Let me now deal with Abraham. And the Lord said to Abraham after that Lot was separated from him. He said do what? &gt;&gt; Lift up now thine eyes. Who's telling Abraham to lift up their eyes? God. &gt;&gt; It's not Abraham himself lifting up their eyes. &gt;&gt; It is God telling him lift up your eyes, &gt;&gt; but Lot lift up his eyes himself. &gt;&gt; Should we come back again or we together? &gt;&gt; Lot lift up his eyes himself. But Abraham lift up the eyes by God command. [Music] &gt;&gt; It depends on who is seeing. That's correct brother. &gt;&gt; Are we together? There are time you see yourself &gt;&gt; and there are time it's God who see through you. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Uh-huh. And the Bible says you need to receive the word with joy. &gt;&gt; I don't know where you were at yesterday. Amen. Uh-huh. And he said, "Lift up now your eyes and look from the place where you are." How? &gt;&gt; Northward. &gt;&gt; And what? and southward &gt;&gt; and water &gt;&gt; and eastward &gt;&gt; and water &gt;&gt; and westward. &gt;&gt; But the problem say God told Abraham now investigate the land. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Abraham was there before. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And famine was there. &gt;&gt; Do you follow me? &gt;&gt; Now God bring Abraham back. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he said, Abraham, &gt;&gt; now raise your eyes. I'm going to show you what is in the place &gt;&gt; that you thought was a problem. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; He said, "Look to the north. &gt;&gt; Look over there." &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; He said, "Yes, sir." He said, "Turn around. Look to the south." &gt;&gt; Turn around. Look over there. &gt;&gt; In other words, the eyes of Abraham &gt;&gt; are going over the property. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Are we together? Where his eyes stop? &gt;&gt; Okay, let me leave it alone. &gt;&gt; For all the land which you water &gt;&gt; to thou seeest &gt;&gt; which thou water &gt;&gt; seeest. &gt;&gt; So the eyes of Abraham &gt;&gt; are marking the property. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All the land which you will see &gt;&gt; to you &gt;&gt; will I do what? &gt;&gt; Give it &gt;&gt; and to what? thy seed &gt;&gt; forever. &gt;&gt; Did Abraham have a baby? &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; So Abraham was not only in famine, but he had no children. &gt;&gt; Follow me, my friend. We're talking about a tree and season. &gt;&gt; In other words, Abraham is in the winter. [Laughter] &gt;&gt; Don't worry, my friend. Are we together? Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; And God say, Abraham, &gt;&gt; look at everything. &gt;&gt; You see all this property, &gt;&gt; I will give it to you &gt;&gt; and I'm going to give to your children. &gt;&gt; And if you notice, God is saying, I will. &gt;&gt; Read your Bible. God is saying what? &gt;&gt; I will. &gt;&gt; But Abraham is already there. &gt;&gt; We clear. Verse uh 16. I will make your seed as what? &gt;&gt; The dust of the earth. &gt;&gt; Did Abraham have a child? &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; Here even Ismael is now born. &gt;&gt; So God is looking at Abraham &gt;&gt; and say &gt;&gt; you need a land. &gt;&gt; You need a property. &gt;&gt; Lift up your eyes. Look, look, look, look, look. It's for you. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And God say, Abraham, do you have a baby? No. He say from you, I'm going to give a baby. But the babies that will come from you, &gt;&gt; I going to be like what? The dust of the earth. &gt;&gt; Can you count the dust of the earth? &gt;&gt; Did Abraham had a baby? &gt;&gt; Can Sarah conceive? So God is giving Abraham a land. &gt;&gt; He's giving him children. &gt;&gt; But nothing is there. &gt;&gt; Children like the dust of what? &gt;&gt; The earth. &gt;&gt; And like what? &gt;&gt; The sand of the sea. &gt;&gt; And the sand of the sea. Continue. And what? Continue, my friend. The sand of the sea. &gt;&gt; And the dust of the earth. So that if a man can number &gt;&gt; the dust of the earth, &gt;&gt; then shall your seed also be what? &gt;&gt; Number. &gt;&gt; So in other word, the seed, the children of Abraham cannot be numbered. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Yet if you look at Abraham, nothing. &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. &gt;&gt; We are together. &gt;&gt; Verse uh 17. Aras endureth. through water. &gt;&gt; A first God say look. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Now &gt;&gt; don't look. &gt;&gt; What do you do? &gt;&gt; Did you build a house yet? &gt;&gt; Did you sign the deed yet? &gt;&gt; No sir. &gt;&gt; Did you negotiate with the bank? &gt;&gt; Abraham walk. &gt;&gt; Why do you walk? Because I already say &gt;&gt; amen. Are we together? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Walk how? &gt;&gt; Through the land, in the water, &gt;&gt; the length of it &gt;&gt; and in the water &gt;&gt; in the breath of it. &gt;&gt; For I will give it to you. Are we clear? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So God say, I show you. &gt;&gt; You saw it. &gt;&gt; I gave it to you. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; The children I gave it to you. Now that we already finished, work on it. &gt;&gt; So if you see Abraham, you will see a man struggling. But who's walking on a property? &gt;&gt; There is. &gt;&gt; You say, Abraham, why are you walking? &gt;&gt; There is. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So you trying to buy a property? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Abraham say I already have one. [Music] &gt;&gt; How do you have it? &gt;&gt; Did you sign the paper? No. God say so. &gt;&gt; Who told you you will live here? Every place that the soul of my foot &gt;&gt; tread upon it, &gt;&gt; God told me to walk on it. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Because brother Brown say footprint means possession. &gt;&gt; In other word, Abraham, put your foot there. &gt;&gt; Put your foot there. Put your foot there. &gt;&gt; So you see Abraham walking like a crazy man. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Everybody together. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's go to Genesis 14. Now we getting to the meat. &gt;&gt; If you there, we can say amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You there? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You there? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Jump to verse 11. If we can finish this quick, we'll be good. Verse 11. The way you moving, it's very slow. Verse 11. Are you there? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The Bible says verse 14. And they took uh let's do this.

So we got four &gt;&gt; four kings and what? &gt;&gt; With five. &gt;&gt; So we got a battle between four king and five kings that's going to go fight. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Abraham is not here. Follow me my friend. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Four and five kings. Job to verse uh uh verse uh 10. And the valley of Sidim was full of slumpit.

He they took Lot Abraham's brother son. who dwell where &gt;&gt; in Sodom &gt;&gt; and all his what? &gt;&gt; His goods.

Who is what? &gt;&gt; Possessor of heaven and earth. So the most high God is what? &gt;&gt; Possessor of heaven and earth. &gt;&gt; The most high God is the possessor of heaven &gt;&gt; and the possessor of what? &gt;&gt; Earth. &gt;&gt; So Abraham is receiving the blessing. &gt;&gt; The ownership of heaven and earth &gt;&gt; is been imported to Abraham. &gt;&gt; I hope we are together now. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. Amen. &gt;&gt; I hope we are together now. If you meet God as Jehovah Nissi, &gt;&gt; he will be your &gt;&gt; B. &gt;&gt; If you meet God as Jehovah Rafa, &gt;&gt; God will heal you. &gt;&gt; But if you meet God as an alon, &gt;&gt; it means that God is coming to you to make you possessor &gt;&gt; of heaven and earth. [Music] &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. &gt;&gt; Amen. Stop. Push the brake. &gt;&gt; Why is God coming to Abraham as Elleon? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Elle for God to reveal to you as Jehovah Rafa. What happened to you? &gt;&gt; Must be sick. &gt;&gt; Can you help me? What happened to you? &gt;&gt; Must be sick. &gt;&gt; You must be sick. That's why God is coming as what? for God to come to you as El Shadai, &gt;&gt; the breasted one. It means you got old, &gt;&gt; you lost strength, &gt;&gt; and you are going down. So, he must come as a breasted one. &gt;&gt; For God to come to you as the possessor &gt;&gt; of heaven and earth, Abraham must be broke. Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Now Abraham got goods. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Instead of the king of Sodom because the king those goods belong to the king of Sodom. &gt;&gt; So the king of Sodom will tell Abraham &gt;&gt; your your wealth. &gt;&gt; It's mine. &gt;&gt; It's mine. It's my health. &gt;&gt; So Abraham, you actually got rich by &gt;&gt; me. &gt;&gt; He said, Abraham, &gt;&gt; look at me. &gt;&gt; Forget about &gt;&gt; look at me. &gt;&gt; I am blessing you. &gt;&gt; As [Applause] &gt;&gt; are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? We need to understand what is possessor of heaven and earth &gt;&gt; because we saying possessor of heaven and earth. Possessor of heaven and earth. What does he mean? &gt;&gt; Church, are we together? I already left the airport now. There was a traffic there. Amen. Brother Brham says this. He says now in Genesis we read of who? &gt;&gt; Abraham &gt;&gt; meeting who? &gt;&gt; This great man called Melkisedc. &gt;&gt; Who was what? &gt;&gt; The possessor of both heaven and earth. Then he was possessor of what? &gt;&gt; All things. &gt;&gt; Possessor of heaven and earth. That is what? &gt;&gt; Of all things. &gt;&gt; So Elleon means the God that possess what? &gt;&gt; All things. &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Elleon means the God that possess what? &gt;&gt; All things. So if he met Abraham, Abraham was broke. &gt;&gt; You say, "Brother Steven, where did you get it?" I told you he was laying in a land &gt;&gt; that was struggling. &gt;&gt; Listen to Brother Brham. As we moving, Brother Brham says this. I like this. Abraham was what? &gt;&gt; Heir to all &gt;&gt; by what? &gt;&gt; The promise. &gt;&gt; Because God told him walk left, right, and everything. So he could do what? &gt;&gt; Lay claim &gt;&gt; on what? &gt;&gt; To everything that was in the land. &gt;&gt; And the land what? &gt;&gt; Itself. &gt;&gt; Abraham has been given what &gt;&gt; the promise. &gt;&gt; Now we understand that Abraham was the poorest man &gt;&gt; in what? &gt;&gt; All the country. &gt;&gt; Because he live out in the what? &gt;&gt; The desert. &gt;&gt; And he live how? &gt;&gt; In peace with God. Amen. [Applause] &gt;&gt; So God when he remove Lot &gt;&gt; he begin to make Abraham struggle &gt;&gt; follow me my friend &gt;&gt; so that all the wealth of Egypt &gt;&gt; can be completely removed [Applause] &gt;&gt; in other words Abraham &gt;&gt; I don't want the fingerprint of Egypt in your house. &gt;&gt; I don't want an Egyptian to come and to say we bless you when you are in Egypt. &gt;&gt; When people come to see you, they need to see me. &gt;&gt; They need to see. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Are we together, &gt;&gt; my friend? Let's move together. &gt;&gt; If not, this will turn into a series. Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. So God during the process of time made the land of Abraham a desertike. &gt;&gt; Suddenly the business of Abraham down. &gt;&gt; Follow me my friend. &gt;&gt; Suddenly everything Abraham got in Egypt begin to go down. &gt;&gt; Abraham become poor. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; God remove lot. Abraham say, "Praise the Lord. Now I'm in peace." God begin to remove the cattle. &gt;&gt; He begin to remove this &gt;&gt; because the servant he had were not the one from Egypt. They were born in his house. &gt;&gt; God begin to clean up the house of Abraham. &gt;&gt; Until Abraham become poor. &gt;&gt; When Abraham became poor, God say, "Now &gt;&gt; let me come down. Oh Jesus, &gt;&gt; when the church of Abraham become very leader 318 say let me come now &gt;&gt; and I'm going to show you it's not by might it's not by strength &gt;&gt; it is by lon &gt;&gt; spoken word &gt;&gt; learn not to look at the number. &gt;&gt; Look at Leon [Music] &gt;&gt; the possessor of all things. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Brother Brham says this. I told you when I begin to jump brother Brandham then the fire. Brother Brham say and he live how &gt;&gt; in peace with God &gt;&gt; and wrought watch my friend was what? &gt;&gt; Rich &gt;&gt; and what? &gt;&gt; Lived in the city &gt;&gt; and became what? &gt;&gt; Of the governor of the city. &gt;&gt; And he sat where? &gt;&gt; In the gate. &gt;&gt; He was what? &gt;&gt; A judge. and did what? &gt;&gt; And judged the city. &gt;&gt; And had what? &gt;&gt; All the riches and things. &gt;&gt; But Abraham was where? &gt;&gt; In the desert. &gt;&gt; And peras the what? &gt;&gt; Poorest man in the land. &gt;&gt; And yet a claim to possess what? &gt;&gt; Oh, &gt;&gt; a man. That is what I like. &gt;&gt; I hope we are clear together. Yes sir. &gt;&gt; God took all the wealth of Egypt &gt;&gt; and clean it up &gt;&gt; from the house of Abraham &gt;&gt; took lot move it away. &gt;&gt; He said only what I give you &gt;&gt; walk in the land. &gt;&gt; Everything that is in the land and the land itself is yours. &gt;&gt; You don't have a children but remember you see the dust that you see there. &gt;&gt; You see the dust that you see there? That's where your children are going to be. I'm still moving on, my friend. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Then when Abraham got into a fight, &gt;&gt; he went and he got a lot of money. &gt;&gt; A lot of good, &gt;&gt; a lot of this things he worked for, &gt;&gt; are we together? &gt;&gt; So Abraham is back to rich. God said &gt;&gt; that wealth is coming from what? &gt;&gt; Sodom. &gt;&gt; And what? &gt;&gt; Gomorrah. &gt;&gt; I don't want the sodomite. &gt;&gt; I don't want the lesbian and gays. to put claim on you. &gt;&gt; I don't want the LBGT &gt;&gt; to say that we sponsor you. &gt;&gt; Don't get money from them. &gt;&gt; I am Lion. &gt;&gt; I am the possessor of everything. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't beg Abraham. &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. Listen to me my friend. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So when the king of Sodom is coming &gt;&gt; say who's coming the king of Sodom. &gt;&gt; He went and preceded the move. &gt;&gt; Why did God come before the king of Sodom? &gt;&gt; You need to see the intent of the king of Sodom. &gt;&gt; Follow me my friend. Look at your Bible. &gt;&gt; We there. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We there. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we there? &gt;&gt; Amen. Verse uh &gt;&gt; uh 20. &gt;&gt; And did what? &gt;&gt; And blessed be the most high God &gt;&gt; which has what? &gt;&gt; Delivered thine enemies into thy hand. &gt;&gt; Stop. How many people went to the battle? &gt;&gt; 318 &gt;&gt; against how many king? &gt;&gt; Four kings. &gt;&gt; How can 318 beat four king that beat five kings? Now, Ellen is saying, Abraham, you know the battle that you fought, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Can we read together? &gt;&gt; I am the one. &gt;&gt; Let's read it. Let's read it. Let's read it. Verse uh 20. And blessed be the what? &gt;&gt; The most high God, &gt;&gt; which delivered what? &gt;&gt; Thine enemies &gt;&gt; into what? &gt;&gt; Into thy hand. &gt;&gt; Who? So, who delivered the enemy of Abraham? &gt;&gt; God. So who fought against the four kings? &gt;&gt; God. &gt;&gt; And God was fighting where? &gt;&gt; In 3 what? &gt;&gt; 18. &gt;&gt; So when 318 people are going, it was not them. &gt;&gt; It was enemy on &gt;&gt; that was there. &gt;&gt; In other words, Abraham, the victory you just got, &gt;&gt; I am the one who gave it to you. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. So the 300 people cannot come and say you see how we fought. &gt;&gt; 300 we suck them all. &gt;&gt; No. Normally 300 cannot defeat that type of an army. So the 300 must come and say brother &gt;&gt; I never knew I can fight like this. I'm telling you when I was fighting I just felt like my hand I'm moving this way &gt;&gt; and I'm making move I don't understand and it's killing people &gt;&gt; because your hand must be God hands &gt;&gt; your eyes must be God's eyes your feet must be God's feet so whatever you do it is God in human flesh &gt;&gt; are we together. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham say because they were farmer. &gt;&gt; Are we together? They were not a train army. &gt;&gt; But suddenly as they were going to war, &gt;&gt; and Leon anointed them &gt;&gt; and before you know it, a man that was maybe feeble &gt;&gt; begin to take a big giant and flip him. &gt;&gt; He said, "I don't understand.

We flipping this giant like a game &gt;&gt; because it's early and [Applause] &gt;&gt; are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So Mechisedc came and say fellowship. &gt;&gt; He said Abraham &gt;&gt; I'm going to bless you &gt;&gt; and I'm blessing you. &gt;&gt; If you notice he's blessing Abraham but Abraham has nothing. &gt;&gt; Amen. He said, "But I bless you as a possessor &gt;&gt; of heaven and earth." &gt;&gt; Because the possessor of heaven and earth, &gt;&gt; he himself started with nothing. &gt;&gt; You have not called it yet. [Music] &gt;&gt; Father, help this church. &gt;&gt; The possessor of heaven and earth &gt;&gt; existed by himself. [Music] He was alone &gt;&gt; but he himself begin to create planet.

Then suddenly Allelon begin to change &gt;&gt; and he begin to immor &gt;&gt; and he took the the the the form of the word &gt;&gt; so he can speak. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together?

Leon when he started, &gt;&gt; he had nothing. &gt;&gt; Then Elleon changed forms &gt;&gt; and he took the form of the word. So now he become the word &gt;&gt; and the Bible say everything &gt;&gt; that ever existed was created by the word [Music] [Applause] &gt;&gt; and the Bible say there was nothing &gt;&gt; that existed that didn't come from the word. &gt;&gt; In other words, the word contain &gt;&gt; everything. Everything. Yes sir. Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Now push the brake church. &gt;&gt; Watch this my friend. &gt;&gt; Abraham, God is telling Abraham, &gt;&gt; he said, "I have given you children &gt;&gt; and the number of your children. &gt;&gt; No one &gt;&gt; can count them." When you look at Abraham &gt;&gt; on the left, no child, &gt;&gt; on the right, no child. Where are the children of Abraham? [Applause] [Music] [Applause] Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; If you want to keep standing, that's okay. &gt;&gt; Let's find &gt;&gt; where God say I have given you. &gt;&gt; We need to know where are the children of Abraham. &gt;&gt; Let's find out where are Abraham children. Yes. &gt;&gt; Leon brought the anointing &gt;&gt; and the anointing came to quicken the potential. [Music] [Applause] [Music] &gt;&gt; I don't need the riches of Egypt. &gt;&gt; I don't need the riches of Sodom. I don't need the riches of Gomorrah. All I need is my portion. [Applause] [Music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Where are the children of Abraham? &gt;&gt; Let's find out. &gt;&gt; The Bible says this. &gt;&gt; The Bible says this. You ready? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You ready? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Remember, &gt;&gt; slow down. Remember. Elleon met Abraham as &gt;&gt; Melkisedc &gt;&gt; and Melkisedc and Abraham met as Abraham and Elleon. &gt;&gt; Now we want to see &gt;&gt; what happened when Abraham and Elleon meet. &gt;&gt; Paul is telling us &gt;&gt; are we together? Paul says, "And verily, &gt;&gt; that's right." &gt;&gt; He's talking about &gt;&gt; Mechisedc. &gt;&gt; He said, "Mequechedc, &gt;&gt; king of Salem, &gt;&gt; without what? &gt;&gt; Father." &gt;&gt; Without what? &gt;&gt; Mother. &gt;&gt; Without what? &gt;&gt; Without what? &gt;&gt; That's the man that met Abraham. &gt;&gt; And Paul said, "And verily they that are of what? &gt;&gt; The sons of Levi." &gt;&gt; Let's be clear. Abraham &gt;&gt; give birth to who? &gt;&gt; Isaac. &gt;&gt; Isaac. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Isaac gave birth to who? &gt;&gt; Jacob. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And uh Jacob. And Jacob gave birth to who? &gt;&gt; So who was the father of Lever? &gt;&gt; It's here. Who was the father of liver? &gt;&gt; Amen. Okay, &gt;&gt; but let's see where Lea was. [Applause] &gt;&gt; You get the point? &gt;&gt; We finished. &gt;&gt; We finished. We finished. &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. Don't do this, please. &gt;&gt; Let's go, my friend. He says, "Who and the sons of who?" Levi, &gt;&gt; not Levi, &gt;&gt; not Levi. The what? &gt;&gt; The sons of Lev. &gt;&gt; 1 2 3 4 5 &gt;&gt; And when Jesus came, &gt;&gt; the Jews told him, Abraham is our &gt;&gt; father. Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's let's stop a liver. &gt;&gt; The Bible says the sons of who? &gt;&gt; Lever. &gt;&gt; So we are here. &gt;&gt; The sons of Lever. &gt;&gt; The sons of Lever. Who does what? &gt;&gt; Who receive the office of the priesthood. &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. Have what? &gt;&gt; A commandment &gt;&gt; to do what? &gt;&gt; To take tithes of the people according to the law. &gt;&gt; That is of what? &gt;&gt; Their brethren. &gt;&gt; Though they came out of the loss of who? &gt;&gt; Abraham. &gt;&gt; Stop. The sons of Lever came from the launch of who? &gt;&gt; Abraham. &gt;&gt; Did Abraham give them birth? &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; The sons of Leah came from Leah. &gt;&gt; But Paul is saying the sons of Leah were who were &gt;&gt; where of Abraham. &gt;&gt; So these children were where [Applause] &gt;&gt; so Abraham was a big container. Elohim, the word was a big container. [Music] &gt;&gt; I don't know if we together. &gt;&gt; I don't know if we together. &gt;&gt; Let's make it worse to Paul. Paul say, "And as I may say, so who?" &gt;&gt; Levi also. Paul say these were where &gt;&gt; Paul say what &gt;&gt; liver who also receive what &gt;&gt; tithe &gt;&gt; he did what &gt;&gt; paid tithe in Abraham &gt;&gt; in Genesis 14 did you see &gt;&gt; no &gt;&gt; where was [Music] [Applause] &gt;&gt; having nothing &gt;&gt; yet possessing [Music] Some of you are lost. &gt;&gt; He says, "And also as a message." So who &gt;&gt; Levi also &gt;&gt; who did what &gt;&gt; receiveth the tithes? &gt;&gt; Paid that where? &gt;&gt; In Abraham. &gt;&gt; So Levi was where? &gt;&gt; In Abraham. &gt;&gt; For he was what? &gt;&gt; Yet in the loins of his father. His father who? Leva was his father is Jacob. &gt;&gt; But his father is who? &gt;&gt; Abraham. &gt;&gt; If sons of Leah were in Abraham &gt;&gt; and Leva was in Abraham. Where was Jacob? &gt;&gt; In Abraham. &gt;&gt; Where was Isaac? &gt;&gt; In Abraham. [Applause] &gt;&gt; So when the season come, When the season come, &gt;&gt; Isaac, Abraham bring Isaac. &gt;&gt; And he's bringing Isaac as a package. &gt;&gt; And Isaac bring Jacob. &gt;&gt; But both of them was in Abraham. &gt;&gt; And Jacob bring liver. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen. Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Leon started himself, &gt;&gt; but in him were stuff. &gt;&gt; And when he became the word, he begin to bring out what was in him. &gt;&gt; Lever in Abraham, &gt;&gt; Jacob, &gt;&gt; Isaac, &gt;&gt; Abraham, &gt;&gt; the sons of Lev, &gt;&gt; in Abraham, &gt;&gt; all of them until Paul say Abraham, the father of what? &gt;&gt; As all That's what Paul say in the New Testament. &gt;&gt; Amen. Abraham have all of them. &gt;&gt; So all it take is anoint Abraham. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And Abra and what was in Abraham &gt;&gt; begin to come out. &gt;&gt; But at the beginning there was nothing. &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. &gt;&gt; Now this is the point. When Abraham &gt;&gt; brought Isaac at the beginning, did anybody see Isaac? &gt;&gt; Did anybody see Jacob? &gt;&gt; Did anybody see Leah? &gt;&gt; But the Bible say Leah was there. &gt;&gt; Did anybody see the sons of Leah? &gt;&gt; All of this came through the process of time. &gt;&gt; But they were already there. &gt;&gt; They came in their season. [Music] So there is a time Abraham is look like no children &gt;&gt; but as the time goes on you will be surprised &gt;&gt; how many children &gt;&gt; are coming from Abraham &gt;&gt; because God already bless him &gt;&gt; is Tony third here &gt;&gt; you know Tony the third &gt;&gt; sir &gt;&gt; the the Beautiful, handsome boy. &gt;&gt; You see how that boy is? &gt;&gt; You see how that boy is? The baby boy is there. &gt;&gt; People are in him. [Applause] [Music] [Applause] &gt;&gt; Maybe you don't understand. As small as he is, &gt;&gt; everything is in him. &gt;&gt; Just let him grow &gt;&gt; and you will find who was in him. He's a possessor of many things. &gt;&gt; In other word, what belong to your life &gt;&gt; is already in you. [Music] [Applause] &gt;&gt; I'm telling you, I'm giving you time to swallow that one. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Listen to this. Paul say in Hebrew 11, &gt;&gt; he said through what? &gt;&gt; Faith. &gt;&gt; We understand that what &gt;&gt; the worlds &gt;&gt; that early Leon did &gt;&gt; were framed by what? &gt;&gt; The word of God. &gt;&gt; How many words? &gt;&gt; The worlds &gt;&gt; one &gt;&gt; plural. &gt;&gt; How many of them? &gt;&gt; Many. Paul is saying the universe that you see there &gt;&gt; were made were fabricated &gt;&gt; were framed by the word of God &gt;&gt; by Elle Leon being the word of God because he was first possessor &gt;&gt; of what &gt;&gt; and then the Bible call him possessor of what? &gt;&gt; Heaven and earth. &gt;&gt; So heaven was where? and earth was where &gt;&gt; so what did &gt;&gt; express what was where &gt;&gt; in &gt;&gt; are we together &gt;&gt; and Paul is saying that he did that by faith &gt;&gt; by revelation &gt;&gt; when he knew what was in him &gt;&gt; he begin to speak it Jesus. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Follow me, my friend. &gt;&gt; So that the things which are what? &gt;&gt; See, &gt;&gt; the never that you see &gt;&gt; when was not made of things that do what? &gt;&gt; Appear. &gt;&gt; In other words, before was manifested, he was first invisible. Let me go back again. &gt;&gt; The Bible is saying, Paul is saying, for the things which are what? &gt;&gt; Seen, &gt;&gt; these things were made of things. What? &gt;&gt; What? &gt;&gt; Were not made of things. &gt;&gt; In other words, this visible things &gt;&gt; came from the invisible things. So before he became visible, &gt;&gt; he was first what? &gt;&gt; Invisible. &gt;&gt; Before Leah came out, &gt;&gt; Leah was already invisibly &gt;&gt; in the loss of Abraham. &gt;&gt; When Abraham was poor, &gt;&gt; his children was there. &gt;&gt; His wife was there. [Applause] Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? Let's go to Genesis 15. &gt;&gt; Father, &gt;&gt; I already went over. I got to stop. &gt;&gt; I got to stop. It's impossible. The Lord, this is just God. We got to call this something else. &gt;&gt; Are we together? Let's get uh &gt;&gt; let me get 15 and see. &gt;&gt; Let's go to verse 15. After these things, I showed you that when the king of Sodom &gt;&gt; was belittling Abraham. &gt;&gt; Abraham already was possessing Levah. &gt;&gt; To possess Levah means you possess the sons of Levah. You possess Jacob, you possess Isaac. In other word, Abraham cannot die. &gt;&gt; Abraham cannot die. &gt;&gt; Abraham won't die if Isaac is not born. &gt;&gt; Because you are cutting off the line of God. &gt;&gt; God already spoke to Leah. &gt;&gt; So you cannot kill Isaac &gt;&gt; until Jacob come out. You cannot kill Jacob until Leah come out. So leave push the brake on everybody [Applause] &gt;&gt; and you won't die. &gt;&gt; You won't die &gt;&gt; until what is in you come out. [Applause] &gt;&gt; You didn't get me well. You will not die if what is in you &gt;&gt; doesn't come out. That's why when they told Abraham, &gt;&gt; kill Isaac. &gt;&gt; He say no problem. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Bring Isaac &gt;&gt; with anointing. Bring him &gt;&gt; Abraham. Are you that scared? Scared of what? &gt;&gt; If he kill Isaac, leave won't come out. &gt;&gt; I'm going to slay Isaac. &gt;&gt; He will be forced to quicken Isaac. &gt;&gt; He will be forced to bring the resurrection. When God heard that, he went, "Ram, ram, ram, ram, come here. Leave Isaac. Leave Isaac. I know you good. Isaac, come on. Come on. Kill the ram." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You're trying to make me make a mistake on my plan. &gt;&gt; What gave Abraham the courage? &gt;&gt; He knew. And the Bible say he knew. You know &gt;&gt; that if you kill &gt;&gt; Isaac, &gt;&gt; you must bring everybody up &gt;&gt; because you already spoke that through people will come [Music] &gt;&gt; in other word whatever is in you &gt;&gt; is even blocking the devil. Amen. &gt;&gt; You didn't get that one. &gt;&gt; You didn't get that one. &gt;&gt; Whatever is in you, &gt;&gt; if he need to come out before you leave, &gt;&gt; even Satan doesn't touch you. &gt;&gt; Until whatever seed is there, &gt;&gt; comes out. &gt;&gt; Let's get this. Let's finish it right here. Okay, because time is gone. &gt;&gt; Verse chapter 15, if you dare, you can say amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; After these things, verse one, &gt;&gt; the word of the Lord came to who? &gt;&gt; Abraham &gt;&gt; in the water. &gt;&gt; In a vision, &gt;&gt; saying what? &gt;&gt; Fear not. &gt;&gt; I was going to you all the way to 17. &gt;&gt; I was going to you slowly all the way to And I'm going to take you all the way to 24. And you see what happened to Abraham &gt;&gt; down the road. &gt;&gt; Because right here he's still poor &gt;&gt; but you're going to see what happened to Abraham. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Fear not Abraham I am what? &gt;&gt; Thy shield &gt;&gt; and what &gt;&gt; and thy exceeding great reward. &gt;&gt; And Abraham say Lord God what will you give me? Seeing I go how &gt;&gt; childless. Paul is saying when Abraham previously spoke to Mkisedc, what was in Abraham? &gt;&gt; Leva. The sons of Leva. Look how Abraham is talking. &gt;&gt; Abraham doesn't see Levah. &gt;&gt; He doesn't see the son of Leva. He begin to go back to the same crisis again. &gt;&gt; Look how I'm childless. &gt;&gt; And now he begin to bring suggestion. He said, "Look how I'm cho and the steward of what? &gt;&gt; My house &gt;&gt; is what? &gt;&gt; This Eleaser of Damascus." &gt;&gt; Do you know what he was really telling God? &gt;&gt; Do you know what he was telling God? &gt;&gt; He said, "You know what? I don't have a child, &gt;&gt; but I know if I die, &gt;&gt; Eleazar of Damascus &gt;&gt; will be." &gt;&gt; He didn't know the children in his launch. Lever are dancing. Levi dancing in the lungs of Abraham [Music] &gt;&gt; when he was walking. Levi is there. &gt;&gt; Jacob is there. Isaac is there. But the time was not yet. &gt;&gt; Amen. [Applause] &gt;&gt; The season for them to come out &gt;&gt; was not yet. &gt;&gt; God was still preparing stuff. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right. &gt;&gt; In Abraham before he bring them out. &gt;&gt; That's exactly right. Amen. &gt;&gt; And when it looks impossible, &gt;&gt; God say the next year. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But Sarah Sarah is already That's not my problem. I say next year &gt;&gt; according to the time of life. &gt;&gt; Time of life for a 90 years old woman. &gt;&gt; Do you think I was crazy when I say time of life? I saw her 90 years, but I'm saying the time of life. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Father help me flat attendant prepare for landing. He says in uh verse uh three and Abraham say behold to me you have given what? &gt;&gt; No seed. &gt;&gt; What was inside of Abraham? &gt;&gt; Look what was inside of Abraham. And what is Abraham saying? &gt;&gt; Because and I have a quote where brother Brandham say we belings I'm paraphrasing stuff because of what we see outside. &gt;&gt; That's correct. &gt;&gt; That's correct. &gt;&gt; He says and Abraham say Lord uh verse uh Abraham behold to me you have given what? &gt;&gt; And lo one born in my house is what? &gt;&gt; My heir. &gt;&gt; In other words Ezra who was born here is the one that's going to take over everything. And behold, the word of the Lord came to him saying, &gt;&gt; "This shall not be your head." &gt;&gt; So you begin to adopt children. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You forget who is Elon. &gt;&gt; Huh? This will not be your hair. &gt;&gt; But he that shall come forth out of what? &gt;&gt; In other words, Abraham, let me be precise &gt;&gt; because you don't understand something. When I told you from you, &gt;&gt; I mean from your &gt;&gt; Bower &gt;&gt; because now you're trying to find alternative &gt;&gt; until you produce Ismael &gt;&gt; because you went before the season. [Laughter] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He says, "But he shall come forth for out of your bower shall be what?" &gt;&gt; Thine air. And he brought him forth where &gt;&gt; abroad. &gt;&gt; And say what? &gt;&gt; Look now toward heaven. &gt;&gt; And tell what? &gt;&gt; The stars. &gt;&gt; If you be able to do what? &gt;&gt; To number them. &gt;&gt; And he said to him, "So shall your seed what?" &gt;&gt; Be. &gt;&gt; We clear there. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We clear there. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Drop to verse uh Hallelujah. Let me see where I can drop here. There was uh Allelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah. Oh my. Praise God. I'm trying to get you where he even changed the name of Sarah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I got it. Let's go to 17 and then we finish. Genesis 17 and then we finish right here. If you dare, you can say amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And when Abraham was 90 years old and nine &gt;&gt; plus I'm just cleaning sorry the Lord appear to Abraham and say to him I am almighty God. In other words, God is revealing all his stuff. &gt;&gt; Walk before me and be you how? &gt;&gt; Perfect. &gt;&gt; And I will make my covenant between you, between me and you. And I will do what? &gt;&gt; Multiply things. &gt;&gt; How? &gt;&gt; Exceedingly. &gt;&gt; He's talking to a poor man. &gt;&gt; That I'm going to multiply you exceedingly. And Abraham fell on his face. And God talked with him, saying, "Be as for me, behold, my covenant is where? &gt;&gt; With thee. &gt;&gt; And you shall be a father of what? &gt;&gt; Many nations. &gt;&gt; Abraham, you shall be a father of what?" &gt;&gt; Many nations. Israel is a nation &gt;&gt; one &gt;&gt; but God say Abraham &gt;&gt; will be a father of what? &gt;&gt; Many nations. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham say even Germany, America and all of them. &gt;&gt; I have the quote. &gt;&gt; Now Abraham you will be a father of what? &gt;&gt; Many nations. &gt;&gt; He said you will be a father of many nation. Have I what? Go to verse uh uh five. And neither shall your name anymore be called what? &gt;&gt; Abraham. &gt;&gt; We will finish here. But your name shall be called what? &gt;&gt; Abraham. &gt;&gt; For a father of what? &gt;&gt; Many nations have I made thee. &gt;&gt; So God switched something in Abraham. &gt;&gt; Yes, he did. &gt;&gt; And we stop here. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. Abraham name was Abraham. &gt;&gt; And God put what? &gt;&gt; Abraham. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He put Abra what? &gt;&gt; Abraham. Right. &gt;&gt; So there is an H and a A that have been put there. A B C D E F G &gt;&gt; H &gt;&gt; Let's go. &gt;&gt; I J. &gt;&gt; Which letter was put? &gt;&gt; And which letter was put? Because one and eight are the same. &gt;&gt; They are the loop of eternity. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The Jewish calendar &gt;&gt; is Sunday. &gt;&gt; Monday, &gt;&gt; Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, &gt;&gt; Saturday, and Sunday. &gt;&gt; Sunday is the first the eighth day, and it's the first day of the week. And God took those two letter and hook it to Abraham and say from now on &gt;&gt; you are not going to be called again Abraham. Now you're going to be called what? Abraham which is what father or what? &gt;&gt; Job to verse 16. &gt;&gt; Verse 15. And God said to Abraham, "As for Sarah, your wife, you shall call her what? &gt;&gt; You shall not call her name Sarah, but &gt;&gt; but shall call her what?" &gt;&gt; Sarah shall her name be. &gt;&gt; And I will bless her and give you a son also of her. Yeah. I will bless her, and she shall be the water, &gt;&gt; the mother of nations. &gt;&gt; Now, we have a father of what? &gt;&gt; Nations. &gt;&gt; And a mother of what? &gt;&gt; Of nations. &gt;&gt; Let's finish here. What does he mean by adding these two letters? &gt;&gt; Because in Genesis 18, the baby's coming. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And in Genesis 24, the wealth of Abraham is coming. &gt;&gt; Let's go to Genesis 24 and we start. &gt;&gt; Genesis 24. Let's go to 24. Genesis 24:34. Let's go, my friend. This is Elaza talking. Let's go. &gt;&gt; Because at the beginning the blessing came from Egypt. &gt;&gt; Then the second blessing came from Sodom and Gomorrah. &gt;&gt; Abraham refused. He said, "No, no, no. I have Elon." &gt;&gt; Jump to verse 34. &gt;&gt; You there? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he said Elaz, I am who? &gt;&gt; Abraham's servant. &gt;&gt; And the Lord has blessed. &gt;&gt; Who blessed Egypt? &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; Who blessed Sodom? &gt;&gt; No. Who blessed Gomorrah? &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; He said the Lord has blessed who? &gt;&gt; My master gave. &gt;&gt; So now the blessing are coming from Goo &gt;&gt; God. &gt;&gt; It just took time. &gt;&gt; But they were coming. &gt;&gt; Isaac was taking time but he was coming. &gt;&gt; He said the Lord has blessed my master.

God sucked that all. &gt;&gt; We don't want the silver from Egypt, the silver from Elon. &gt;&gt; He gave him silver and water &gt;&gt; and gold &gt;&gt; and water &gt;&gt; and men's servants &gt;&gt; and water &gt;&gt; and made and water &gt;&gt; and camels &gt;&gt; and water and asses. &gt;&gt; Stop.

And you are possessor of office. &gt;&gt; Everything you have need of is in you. [Music] &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Let's push the break here. Sister Adasa &gt;&gt; call this &gt;&gt; Elleon. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If not call this the mystery &gt;&gt; of Elleon. &gt;&gt; We are preaching revealed mysteries. &gt;&gt; Are we together &gt;&gt; church? Let's stop here. Time is gone. Let's stand. [Applause] Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; God &gt;&gt; doesn't speak &gt;&gt; for nothing. [Music] &gt;&gt; Today you look bare. Today you look poor. &gt;&gt; Today you look small &gt;&gt; but it doesn't mean you are what you are. &gt;&gt; What matter is what is inside of you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Sorrowful but yet always rejoicing &gt;&gt; as having nothing &gt;&gt; but possessing all things. &gt;&gt; All it take. &gt;&gt; Do you know that God spoke the word? &gt;&gt; Yes. And brother Brandham say it took how many years? &gt;&gt; Because me and you when he say &gt;&gt; he came out. Brother Brandham say when he spoke he didn't come out. &gt;&gt; He took &gt;&gt; brotherham say million. &gt;&gt; But God believed &gt;&gt; his own word. &gt;&gt; When brother Brandham created the square the first one came quick. &gt;&gt; Yes it did. The second one came quick. Brother Brandham said God saym the boy he won't learn. &gt;&gt; He will be anxious. &gt;&gt; The third squirrel God delayed. &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham stop. He say I'm going home. He say &gt;&gt; where you going? &gt;&gt; How many did you say? &gt;&gt; Stay right there. &gt;&gt; To teach him &gt;&gt; the process of time. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What was brother Brandham looking for? &gt;&gt; Squirrel. Where was his squirrel at? &gt;&gt; In LA Leon. &gt;&gt; What are you looking for? &gt;&gt; What are you looking for in your life? &gt;&gt; What do you want &gt;&gt; that makes you compromise the word of God &gt;&gt; until you have to leave the message? You have to compromise in the word. &gt;&gt; You have to tell lies. &gt;&gt; You have to maneuver this way and that way. What do you need? &gt;&gt; God don't want anybody &gt;&gt; to take glory &gt;&gt; of you. &gt;&gt; His glory, he would not share it &gt;&gt; with no one. &gt;&gt; Lest you say that I made Abraham rich. [Music] Leah in you, &gt;&gt; Jacob in you, &gt;&gt; Isaac in you. &gt;&gt; All the patriarch &gt;&gt; were in Abraham. &gt;&gt; Every patriarch &gt;&gt; was in Abraham. &gt;&gt; All of them were in Abraham. &gt;&gt; In other words, the entire nation of Israel &gt;&gt; was in Abraham. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because I'm not getting where I wanted to go. When Abraham finally understood the Bible say he begin to call things &gt;&gt; that are not as though &gt;&gt; Abraham now begin to learn the laws that things that are visible &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; are coming from invisible &gt;&gt; change your name &gt;&gt; so when they call you Abraham it will hit your here &gt;&gt; father of many. We are understanding Abraham. &gt;&gt; What we really mean it's father of many nation. &gt;&gt; Father of many nation and he keep hitting Abraham. Father of many nation until the people say you know what he say call him like that. He get upset if you say Abraham call him Abraham. And the people begin to make fun father of many nation. &gt;&gt; And God say let it go like that until he became father of many nation. And by the time Solomon come, you can search the scripture. The Bible say the number of Israel was so big until no one could number Israel. &gt;&gt; By the time Solomon came, Israel was without number. I can show you that by the scripture. &gt;&gt; So when Abraham was gone, Abraham blessing still gone. &gt;&gt; Let's pray. Heavenly Father, &gt;&gt; Lord, we approaching you humbly this afternoon. Father, thanking you for your grace, for your love, for your mercy, and for everything you have been doing for us. Father, this is as far as you wanted me to go with the ability you have given. Father, you have spoken to somebody. Of course, you spoken to all of us to depend completely upon thee. The world is not our inheritance. The system of this world is not what we depending on. compromising on the message because of difficulty of time and circumstances. It's not what you're calling us for. You're calling us to stay on your position. And you are revealing to each one of us today that whatever we need of &gt;&gt; is in us &gt;&gt; and all it takes is a process of time. And when the time comes right and the season arrive, there is nothing that will block whatever was put in us to come out. Father, when I was born, my mother did not know that she was holding a doctor. She did not know that she was holding a pastor. She did not know that she was holding a deacon. She is not know that she was holding a business owner. All the potential that was in me, none of them were manifested in that time. &gt;&gt; But Lord, Father, I was born like a package. And through the process of time, the devil was unable to stop all of them. &gt;&gt; And whatever is still inside that need to come out will continue to come out. &gt;&gt; And Satan will have no power to stop any of them. &gt;&gt; Even when you were coming up in this world, the devil thought he can stop you. He went killing children. But he never touched the promised seed. Because what you have determined by your prayer, by your forn knowledge, Father, no matter what it is, it will come to pass. Lord, may your children rest on your word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; May they rest upon Ellelon, the possessor of all things, &gt;&gt; the possessor of all uh of heaven and earth.

Where was Eve? All it took was a process of time &gt;&gt; and God pulled Eve from Adam. &gt;&gt; Your solution, let me leave it for next Sunday.
