[25:14] [Music]
[25:20] amen
[25:24] amen God bless you
[25:27] Saints I just want to give this
[25:29] testimony for the glory of God um it's
[25:31] actually a continuing um testimony um I
[25:34] know um it's been I think almost eight
[25:36] months maybe a little bit longer since I
[25:38] got my new job at um uh Mattress Firm
[25:41] and um then I the house meeting gave a
[25:45] testimony that um I received um the
[25:47] opportunity to become a manager at my
[25:49] store after only being there for six
[25:51] months um really the reason for this
[25:53] testimony is not to brag on what has
[25:55] happened with anything am I doing but
[25:57] just what God has done for me and how
[25:59] amazing he is and how the word is very
[26:02] much on point um I know Pastor been
[26:04] talking about a lot of different
[26:05] subjects he was talking about discipline
[26:07] he was talking about you know um having
[26:08] our faith in God and really having a
[26:10] spoken word and after being under such a
[26:14] a anointing a Ministry you could see how
[26:16] he you know definitely will show you not
[26:18] only in the spiritual when we're here
[26:19] together but outside of here at your job
[26:22] and in other places so um to make it
[26:25] quick and short um I took the position I
[26:27] had no idea what I was going to when I
[26:30] got the job I um basically got my own
[26:33] store when I got the store the store was
[26:35] a mess a mess meaning a way it's
[26:38] presentable how it looked um I don't
[26:40] want to go into details but it just
[26:41] wasn't you know a very very good one it
[26:43] was also on the bottom of the list in
[26:45] our region or sorry in our district so
[26:48] in within two months um no sorry within
[26:51] a month and a half um again nothing of
[26:53] myself God allowed me to go into that
[26:56] store and take it from the bottom bottom
[26:58] of the rankings to the number two in the
[27:04] region then additionally not only that
[27:07] and I honestly have no words to tell you
[27:10] how it happened I understand there's a
[27:12] spirit that comes with Christians you
[27:14] know but people can sense it we don't
[27:17] even know it I don't know if I attracted
[27:19] the people it was very weird because
[27:21] nobody would come to that store I also
[27:25] somehow CU I didn't see the money but
[27:28] but somehow the um the uh I was ranked
[27:33] number one in the region so not the
[27:35] district but the region as well I I
[27:37] looked at the the chart three weeks in a
[27:39] row and I just couldn't understand so I
[27:40] want to give glory to God for that
[27:42] because it showed that you know um
[27:44] someone can come in and and it's never
[27:46] been done before by the way so I just
[27:48] want to give glory to God for that but
[27:49] mainly going into the last part of the
[27:52] testimony I'm keep trying to keep it
[27:53] short um um at near the end um our
[27:58] district manager who was the new
[27:59] district manager when I got the position
[28:00] she's the one who offered me the job she
[28:02] ended up quitting for a certain reason
[28:04] when she quit it's like the whole
[28:06] company came on me because we had an
[28:08] agreement that I would be able to work
[28:10] basically what we I'll use the
[28:12] terminology someone use a special
[28:14] schedule so that I could attend church
[28:16] and run my business well when the is she
[28:18] left they said um excuse me ma'am no and
[28:22] I said okay then well I will be stepping
[28:24] down because I wasn't going to um miss
[28:27] out on standing on about the word of God
[28:29] and being in the house of God and I know
[28:30] you guys probably noticed with this
[28:31] whole month that I wasn't in church I
[28:33] was very very not happy about that but I
[28:35] said I'll stick it through with the word
[28:36] of God being talking about discipline
[28:38] and and run my way through the course
[28:40] but I said no as soon give me a date and
[28:42] then I'll step down so as of last
[28:45] Tuesday I've stepped down and I'm very
[28:47] happy with my decision that doesn't
[28:48] change anything too much there was a few
[28:50] extra bonuses who cares God will provide
[28:52] and there's a lot of other things that
[28:53] he's doing in my life but I just want to
[28:54] give glory to God for what he did
[29:01] amen God bless
[29:04] you
[29:07] amen he'll honor
[29:10] that
[29:12] amen we got one special brother Angelo
[29:15] and sister um Victoria this morning then

[41:35] yesterday I was able to listen to the
[41:37] message and it was actually a funeral
[41:41] service that brother brandham was
[41:43] preaching on
[41:45] expression and it happened I told my
[41:47] wife it happened after the departure of
[41:49] a minister of the Gospel in the message
[41:52] brother barudi I say so the Lord kept
[41:54] that message just for me to hear he it
[41:57] at the same time and if you listen to
[42:00] that message you won't even cry because
[42:02] the way brother brandham explained death
[42:04] and then what happened it's really
[42:07] beautiful and I say God so you save this
[42:09] message just to make sure you comfort me
[42:13] whenever this man of God is going on to
[42:16] be with the Lord so remember the family
[42:19] in prayer he passed away in Canada had

[42:25] will uh strength and his wife and
[42:28] everything amen amen Lord's willing this

[42:51] question and answer I believe I got
[42:53] everything covered brother Glenn if I

[42:57] clear brother ky say we clear so let's
[42:59] get on the
[43:04] word again please forgive me if I have
[43:07] not replied to your
[43:09] messages that was just the voicemail not
[43:12] to mention the text messages the
[43:15] WhatsApp messages the email and they
[43:19] keep piling up every day you remove 30
[43:21] you got 40
[43:24] so so be very patient with me sometime
[43:28] we got emergency you got to leave
[43:29] everything and you handle the emergency
[43:31] first before you get there so I begin to
[43:34] understand when brother Bram was saying
[43:36] he get to a room and the room is filled
[43:37] with invitation and he didn't know what
[43:40] to do he have to pray and pick one and
[43:43] just go the way the Lord lead him so
[43:45] sometime it's hard but we will try by
[43:47] God's grace amen I know the list is
[43:50] getting longer so be patient with me
[43:53] whoever we need to talk to amen let's go
[43:57] to our scripture same one because we
[44:00] were not able to even move Genesis 39
[44:04] and the reason why I'm putting Genesis
[44:06] 39 is to show you where we are at and
[44:10] what we are still dealing with amen
[44:13] until we move to the next stage
[44:16] amen this thing is so
[44:19] loaded prise
[44:21] God never thought we're going to be in
[44:23] part uh 15
[44:29] Genesis 39 verse1 if you dare you can
[44:33] say amen amen and Joseph was brought
[44:37] down to Egypt and Piper an officer of
[44:41] pharaoh captain of the Guard an Egyptian
[44:45] bought him of the hands of the
[44:48] ishmaelite which had brought him down
[44:51] there you might be
[44:52] seated and the
[44:55] Lord was with Joseph
[44:57] we found out that this was disclosed in
[45:00] the house of Piper in other word when
[45:03] Joseph is put to
[45:06] work when Joseph is put to
[45:10] work amen this is when the hand of the
[45:14] Lord
[45:15] unfolded it doesn't mean God was not
[45:18] with him God was already with him God is
[45:21] the one that gave him the dreams but the
[45:23] way God begin to unfold in the house of
[45:26] Piper is different than in the house of
[45:29] Canaan so what I want you to remember is
[45:32] a
[45:33] work you remember that last Sunday yes a
[45:37] work that's when God begin to unfold
[45:40] himself
[45:42] amen verse uh two and he was in the
[45:45] house of his master the Egyptian yes sir
[45:48] I was looking for you there we
[45:50] go and his master saw that the Lord was
[45:54] with him and that the Lord made all that
[45:58] he did to prosper in his
[46:01] hand and Joseph found Grace in his sight
[46:05] and he served him Joseph a servant and
[46:08] he made him overseer over all his house
[46:12] and all that he had put into his hand so
[46:15] whatever will happen in the future is
[46:17] not something new somebody was given a
[46:20] story to
[46:24] manage amen were you here this morning

[46:40] message God put me through a path where
[46:44] I come across Doctrine and things and
[46:46] all kind of stuff and I didn't know why

[46:57] time that he had made him
[47:00] Overseer in his house and over all that

[1:25:31] with
[1:25:36] you then we will know you the one that
[1:25:39] was appointed so the one that was
[1:25:42] appointed is the one that is

[1:26:37] unspoken the same angel on the pet is
[1:26:41] the angel on the

[1:26:52] synchronizing
[1:26:56] are we together am are we together amen

[1:37:57] brother Bram brother Bram said many
[1:38:00] times we substitute so much instead of

[1:38:09] substituting what a lot of other things
[1:38:11] that shouldn't be after all churches for
[1:38:14] what preaching the word testimonies are
[1:38:17] what are fine and different things that
[1:38:20] we do is what is wonderful but we must
[1:38:22] give the what word first place because
[1:38:26] it is for what The Sinner and for the
[1:38:29] people that has what the Holy Spirit
[1:38:32] also Jesus said when sat tempted him he
[1:38:35] said it is what written men shall not

[1:39:11] root in good what soft ground and goes
[1:39:14] to what growing the cam that you are
[1:39:17] feeling today is the holy spirit that is
[1:39:20] in you amen that's why I'm in
[1:39:23] encouraging you read the Bible listen to
[1:39:26] the message listen to the T because you
[1:39:30] are feeding your own camel amen the more
[1:39:34] you feed in your camel the bigger the
[1:39:36] camel is growing in other words you

[1:39:43] favor listen to this my friend I love

[1:39:59] live by what by bread alone but by what
[1:40:02] every word that proceedeth out of the
[1:40:04] mouth of God so the Holy Spirit feeds on
[1:40:07] the what the word and then when you hear
[1:40:10] what the word everyone want to do what
[1:40:12] to hear it no matter every little piece
[1:40:14] of what of literature that they can pick
[1:40:16] up they do what they read it and they

[2:09:17] Christ
[2:09:18] amen amen
[2:09:21] Samuel 16 if you thereare you can say
[2:09:24] Amen we stop at verse
[2:09:26] 13 if you
[2:09:28] remember the Bible say then Samuel took
[2:09:31] the horn this is where we stop on
[2:09:34] Sunday and anointed him where in the
[2:09:37] midst of his Brethren he was anointing
[2:09:40] before everybody remember the Lord is my
[2:09:43] shepherd in in the presence of my enemy
[2:09:46] you remember that Sunday and the spirit
[2:09:48] of the Lord Came Upon Who David from

[2:09:54] and went to
[2:09:56] what let's pick up to verse 14 amen amen
[2:10:00] remember the
[2:10:01] requirement for the King was the heart
[2:10:04] yes God say I provided myself yes a
[2:10:08] queen amen amen a king and that King God
[2:10:13] have to chose him not by the countenance

[2:10:33] is in the hand of who the Lord as the
[2:10:35] river of what of water he turn it
[2:10:38] whichsoever he will amen so God long for

[2:10:45] that we are a kingdom we were be made
[2:10:48] King and priest every man
[2:10:52] every way of a man is right in his own

[2:12:07] how did they know it's coming from
[2:12:11] God what was the purpose of this evil
[2:12:15] spirit why didn't God just
[2:12:19] remove the Holy Spirit
[2:12:22] and leave Soul alone

[2:13:16] to be able to unlock it because that
[2:13:19] dream was a way for Joseph
