him especially in this day where the pandemic is going on we need him everything is so confused the media is confused politics confused that's what brother branham said there is an uncertain sound everywhere you don't know who's telling the truth or not but we know where the truth is it's in the message of the hour praise the lord i was reading a quote back there uh in the revelation of jesus christ brother branham say that so then you see why satan is so against the book of revelation you say anything that is revealed spiritual revelation certainly is against it he say that's why he so against the ministry today he said because what is it the revealing of christ so brother branham start first with the book of revelation then he put it with his own ministry so we wonder whether the book of revelation was truly the ministry of brother branham god's willing we will deal into it this is the end time ministry we love it the devil is against it we stand for it we back it up and we live for it and it is the message of the hour praise the lord we greet you all in the name of jesus christ i know there's more many more people online god richly bless you and we trust this will be a

world of prayer kind heavenly father lord jesus such a presence to be here o god lord i just appreciate how your people god they brought such reverence in hell lord we just feel the fragrance of the holy spirit so lord we are careful what we are saying lord we actually that your holy spirit will have full preeminence lord and god as we read these words lord has been read by many mens of god but lord god if you don't come tonight that it won't be anointed lord it just would be letters we know that the letter killers but the spirit give us life so we act for the anointing of the holy ghost to rest upon my shoulder oh god may you're not the congregational god lord god i i know they are poor because i can feel the right atmosphere i believe that the angel of the lord that's in this place

appreciate your god and just bless us here tonight we thank you in advance in jesus name amen amen why are you standing amen we're just turning our bibles to isaiah the 40th fourth chapter and we read from verse six down to verse 8 are we thereby saying amen thus says the lord the king of israel and his redeemer the lord of hosts i am the first and i am the last he the first and he the last in the other word he's alpha and he's a maker and he's all in between and besides me there is no god do we understand that besides me there's no god so we're not looking at buddha allah what god that people worship there's only one god verse seven and who as i shall call and shall declare it and set it in order for me since i appointed the ancient people and the things that they are coming and shall come let them show unto them for ye not neither be afraid have not i told thee from that time i have declared it yea all even my ye are my witnesses even even is there a god besides me yea there is no god i know not any glory to god i feel something off of that now let's turn to isaiah 45 and verse 5. amen praise the lord isaiah 45 and verse 5. now these amen these are coming from the lips of isaiah but he was anointed under the anointing of god the father that was using the lips of the prophet amen verse six verse five i am the lord and there is no none else there is no god beside me a girl of thee though thou has not known me that they may know from the rising of the sun and from the west and there is none beside me i am the lord and there is none else i form light watched it now i formed light i created darkness i made peace and created evil god created evil did i read that right fine let's read that again wow god created evil man let's read six again that they may know from the rising of the sun and from the west and there is none besides me i am the lord and there is none is i form light and create darkness i make peace and create evil i the lord do all some things did i read that wrong do all things let us just buy our heads and we'll pray our kind heavenly father we thank you lord jesus for the reading of your word now sanctify it to our soul this we say acts in jesus name let the believer of the lord say amen and you may be seated amen again we just appreciate the lord amen we're not going to hold you long amen uh sometime i put this watch up here but sometimes i go way beyond caught up in another dimension so if uh i don't know the deacon is but just kind of wave your hand but you got to wave your hand fast because if you wave your hand like this that means keep on preaching preacher amen praise the lord amen i just want to by the help of the lord i just want to deal with the message that our prophet preached and the title of that message was the sovereignty of god oh my the sovereignty of god now uh i want to uh the title is the sovereignty of god and if if i could have a subtext it would be who is controlling earth affairs who is controlling earth affairs what says the scripture and the prophet that's what i love about brother steve so well amen he he lays it on the word and if you don't believe he'll put it and let you know the prophet said and i i just appreciate that amen that's what god's people amen based everything on the word that's why we could believe the prophet amen he's a word prophet i don't know how people uh get them all mixed up and i do know if you ain't ordained for you just won't see it amen amen let's look at the word let us keep moving on and i get way out there in left field amen now just want to look at the word the definition of the word sovereign the word sovereign is one who abideth alone and who has no governing body a king who's ruled softly from his dictate of his own heart mind sometimes i believe my my my family feel like i'm a god because i just do just like i want right now i would do some work around the house and then tell me daddy that what are you doing and then wow you doing my wife said wow what are you doing now and they learned you know man we're gonna mess with i'm a small god you know you might always just leave him alone you know he gonna do what he wants you know but i told them i said you can't see but after it's all over you say wow what a masterpiece i i was doing some work in the house and uh my daughter my oldest daughter i bless the lord i'm looking forward to be here my oldest daughter came home from work and i said look gloria how you like this yeah she mumble and i said look glory well you know i know how she act and now when things ain't going right at some glory how do you like that she said uh it's okay i said oh oh i said what's wrong it's it's it's taking up spaces it just didn't seem like you're making everything all clustered up i said baby i'm not finished with it i said wait till i finish putting the touch to the final touch see people don't understand but wait god is making that final touch are you hearing me i said this wait till i do the final touch on it and just wait till i paint she just walked away and she said well daddy i can't see it i said well you know some everybody don't have you know everybody can't see this revelation everybody so don't get upset when people going back out left field and just can't see it bless all your eyes because you could see it so she kind of walked away you know i didn't understand daddy but when i finished that final touch and when i finished putting that uh that that sherry william paint on it and then i was off preaching somewhere and she sent me a text and said daddy oh daddy she said that does look good say just don't pay me no attention and so i use that when i do other things i said well you remember you told me don't pay you no attention amen so sometimes my children feel like well you know he's going to do it just like he won't so a king who ruled some league from his dictate of his own heart and whose ever decision is final let me read something here before i just get started here it's as the darkness around us depends and men lead more and more to the glorification of themself rather than christ the needs grows more urgent for the teaching of god's full control on earth as well as in heaven many will confess that god's rules in the heaven but for the most part of his rulership on earth is out doubt it's doubted or outright deny why the modern intellectual thinkers pushes the creator more and more into the background thank god he sent us a prophet in his days amen preaching adopting the sovereignty of god now if you will you just turn with me to exodus i type these words into here so if i misread something i forgive me i just print it out in a hairy amen let's just turn with me exodus the seventh chapter amen as you know i just thank god for this revelation that he has given to us amen as uh my precious brother said early man satan hates revelation because revelation revealed the devil and that's why he is so upset with us and he know he can't do nothing with us because we are living in the end time and we know the devil moves we got satan answers amen so satan hates genesis and he hate genesis is a c chapter that shows the beginning and everything that we see now listen to me because we're going to explain that later everything that you see now everything that you could see with your element your six i uh your elements are uh yo yo your eyes you can see it's these are the things that was in noise days you you see the the glamour you see the the great fall on the way don't don't be surprised these were the things that was in north day and i believe in nora days i believe there was a broad of people that was going there to hear noah preach noah kept preaching it's going to rain his next sermon he gave his taste it's going to work it's going to rain it got so in the people's mind it become uh just a formality until they got tired of coming to church they got tired hearing the prophet talk all the time they got tired so they wanted to hear other clergymans so by then hearing other clergymen they start deviating off of what noah said see noah was trying to tell them to get into the ark and god has got an ark of safety this morning which is the message of the hour now it's one thing to be around the ark and there's another thing to be in the ark are you hearing me there's a lot of people that is around the ark amen around this message but i'm going to want to be just around this man saying lord let me be in the message let me be a part of the message the message is just not books and tapes and quotes amen amen the message is reality are you hearing me so that's why it's got to come off the pages and it's got to live in my heart that's what i've been asking god it's it's all right for me to read the bible it's all right for me to walk with the quote book the seal book have the tape have the hospital head on the wall all of that good but what good is it it's going to do if he's not in my heart i told my wife i i got into a place now i just want more of god i've gotten to a place but i do i don't too much care if my necktie matches my shoes i'm just trying to get this word out now because i see the the the cuntiness of the devil amen we got to fall in love i told my wife i said i i've i've i've seen we could have a a million couple million dollar church finite church fine facility nice a fellowship hall you can have all of that and don't even have christ now i believe that the prophet of god our prophet for this generation if you will notice the prophet of god he came so simple that a lot of people miss him now i'm sure that brother brown has some millionaires in his church but if you ever been to the voice of god the old uh voice of god recorded and in jeffersonville indiana it's just a little square builder how many of them been there a little square simple build ain't nothing pretty about it it ain't fancy the ceiling is real low it got some little columns in the middle i mean everything just it's got a little like a little older smell to it i mean ain't nothing fancy about it now i'm sure if you look at the voice of card voice of god recordings if i remember i think it had some nice columns it's a real fact not the one that joseph had but the old ones kind of a little bit more fancier so brother browner came real simple so i say all that they say that i don't care about a church don't have to have chandeliers and and pop organs and and the choir got the same they may hold the keys right to the turn blew into faith none of that matters nothing no more what i want to preach now i want to preach the holy ghost that the people get a revelation why they coming to church that's what i find out people need i find all the years people come to church just calls up a beautiful church then when pressure comes they go the other way but let me tell you what somebody asked me to say about a few months ago and said brother children what are you going to do i said what kind of question is that they said what are you going to do i said i'm going to do what i've always been doing i've been serving to god before i met this man excuse me i've been knowing god way before i knew the devil [Applause] the devil wasn't even god's mind from the beginning you was in his mind you was a thought of god from the foundation of the world now see y'all y'all been talking about that now i'm trying not go there but that spirit is in here by predestination the the foreign knowledge of god election is all in here but i i didn't come to preach that i come to preach to you the sovereignty of god oh praise god oh i feel i feel real i feel all young again my mind praise the lord amen exodus the seventh chapter mind off all part of me uh y'all sorry i'm sorry now if i'm not following church order correctly because i i i i'm breaking protocol now oh my exodus the seventh chapter takes it up to the seventh chapter and we begin to read uh from the first verse and it reads now this was god instruction to moses are you listening at me this was god this was an error this was this wasn't pharaoh this was coming from who god okay now what now god don't make no mistake right god is perfect in all of his way right there's no failure in god right so we know that all things work together to the what to the good to them that of the call according to the purpose so you first got to realize there's a purpose then you know you got a purpose then you know you got an election see and those that are called those that love now that romans 8 28 is not for everybody everybody call according to the bypass are you hearing me so you've been called justified sanctified and already been glorified in god's mind we we we already you know the only thing we try to get this whole past how to act right and i want to tell you and sisters you're wasting your time you go to a good service you go home or you can shout out here praise god but if you don't pray that that hair cuts up this thing right here acts up he'll get real ill if he don't get enough rest and get ill if it don't eat right he'd get ill my wife told me last night i got to talk outside i worked so hard i got to talking so much she said you this what happened to you when you tired that's what you're talking about so this flesh ain't no good but we see mine uh yeah brother steve i'd have to come back and i'm gonna do all that talk i just feel good tonight my mind just don't know how to do it i'm in dennis house amen i'm just cutting up and and the bible said in exodus 7 chapter and the lord said unto moses see i have made thee a god now you know god is the object of worship to pharaoh and aaron thy brother shall be thy prophet in other words moses you be like god you speak you tell aaron and everyone go do what you tell him to do that's right verse 2 thou shalt speak all that i command thee and aaron thy brother shall speak unto pharaoh that he send the children of israel out of the land and i will harden pharaoh's heart and multiply my side of my signs and my wonders in the land of egypt now the prophet god said egypt was a type of the world or an organization but pharaoh shall not hearken unto you that i may lay my hand my god want to lay his hand upon egypt and bring forth my armies and my people the children of israel out of the land of egypt by the great judgment and the egyptian shall know that i am the lord when i stretch forth my hand upon egypt and bring out the children of israel from among them and moses and aaron did as the lord command them listen what we got to do we got to do like the lord commands us now this cannot just go back and just kind of bring something out that the lord just showed to me now you see that when god you know god spoke to moses just like he speaks to the bride but we must understand the mind of god i think we need to understand how god's work we we need to understand the nature of god so you know the nature of god you know how god worked because god is love the bible said he that love is known god for god is love first john 4 7 8 so god is love but here's moses can you imagine if i just paraphrased would it be all right can you imagine god speak to moses god speak to brother steve and brothers teach oh my he wakes up in the middle of the night he said honey wake up wake up sister wake up god just spoke to me what what do you say honey god told me to tell the people such and such a building that's coming we got a new building lord gonna give us a villain she said and she just wakes up she said honey really he said yes god just spoke to me well brother steve come and tell y'all what god's gonna give us a new building everybody said whoa whoa praise god hallelujah everybody get ready man we ain't got number one more month rent here oh we don't have to be coming here no more we going to our new building or we need to put it on the billboard matter of fact i'm going to put it on instagram we're gonna put it on facebook pastor steve shingles amen i told you i told you y'all didn't believe we was called y'all thought we was out of order but god's gonna give us a new building so everybody inside everybody ready to go and so moses told aaron to look let's go down there and tell pharaoh now brother brown said moses going down to egypt then that day was like going against russia one man with a dried up stick in his hand but that's all he had all dried up stick but when he pick it up it was a judgment rod when he hung it over egypt so you ought to be happy that god sent a prophet to this dying generation and call a bride out not only a bride but a gentile bride and getting her ready for the mayor's supper well i just feel like preaching now let me let me calm down because before you say yeah because most people know how evangelists preach they'll be all over the place but let me kind of slow down here but hear aaron saying to uh moses said now aaron no tomorrow we're leaving everyone say what where we going we're going down to king pharaoh and i can imagine aaron aaron was a man did the bible say elijah would like passion as we are can you imagine brother steve yeah we we going before the president somebody said well i'm not afraid of donald trump i guarantee you you had to go stand in front of the mr president and you had to make a speech or say something you'd be all nervous you have your little nose how you supposed to say it you you know you get all messed up i'm all nervous and drop your nose and miss ryan call him mrs president you're all messed up in your mind but see moses told aaron look brother when we go down there he said we're going to egypt yes we're going to egypt and brother when they went down to egypt moses told aaron said speak thus saith the lord oh everyone stood up there i could imagine stood up there and the wind just blowing hey man well i don't know where matter wasn't blowing in the place amen but aaron was standing there and when everyone spoke that said the lord moses let my people go and and they will look back i mean like moses the people ain't moving what's wrong oh see we want to harry god we want to put a time when this supposed to happen we want to put our time but see god is sovereign within itself now there ain't nobody to tell god how to run his business ain't nobody big enough to tell god how to run his business he says i am god and i'm god all by myself there wasn't nobody to tell god how to put the stars in his orbit there wasn't nobody to tell god how to make the sea and the ocean roll at night there was nobody there was no man standing there and said oh god oh god you got the sun a little too close you got it 93 billion miles in there but let's take a little further because it's going to be too hot on there nobody nobody was there to tell god how to run his business he was god and god alone and when we get the understanding how god runs his program then we are walking to life as he is in the light come with the dewdrop so you won't be all wishing watch and wonder what god is doing that's why the prophet of god said in the sixth seal he said don't try to manufacture nothing just walk amen right this day man and that's what i try to do i don't try to manufacture nothing the only thing i do is just love the lord i just love those that despise me to use me especially especially my friends do you know your enemy can't hurt you they're actually where you get those scars from i got it from the house of my friend brother steve your enemy can't hurt you it's going gonna be your closest friend the one that you thought was your buddy the one that went out and ate lunch with you and your wife the one that held your little girl of your little boy and say ain't she pretty oh don't your wife have a nice dress song i wish i had one like her they'll be the one that they caught you but what god is doing is building character don't tell god how to run

happened to me brother branham said brother brown is saying somebody say well brother browner uh uh let me read some of the prophet god said here and i i love so well do you love the lord and and and he says why did god let this happen brother branham why did god do this this was in the hebrew book amen uh he says uh why did god let this happen brother brother why did god do this or that god does that let him alone just walk on that's god's business the footprint of the righteous order by the lord yes sir what difference does it make i lost my money brother brianna well bless god in her oh i did this and that happened a storm blew my house bless god in her the lord giveth and the lord taketh away just keep on walking it's all for the glory of god god knows what he is doing so that's why we need to have confidence in god there ain't nothing out of cater now i can get real personal with you if you allow me god knows all day he knows that he flee that heart he knows they have a hat on your head god know how many people what's going to be in this building and god knows how many what's going to be screaming it there ain't nothing allocated with god this what happened to this church you think it you thinking you think you caught god by surprise god knew this before we did we thought everything was good when we thought we everybody loved the lord god already i knew he knew it's going to be at a point at times god's gonna allow things to be manifest and i'm gonna tell you brother sister you got to love god with all your heart this one thing this one thing you can't fake you can't you say well brother children i got love chris and science got that where brother children i come to church you can't base it on that because christian science got love brother brown said you said well oh she's such a kind sister oh he's just a con bruh you can't base your salvation on that because the kind priest did did not stay and brother brown said it was of the devil even jesus said that so what i'm trying to say we got to thank god for his grace god is sovereign in what he do you love the lord oh my do you love him with all your heart let me read something here a quote from the prophet it said does he say and god being sovereign there is no one to tell him what to do or how to do it and that makes me feel good and it ought to make us all feel good let's read another quote doing god is servant god is sovereign first we want to understand do you believe that god is sovereign now i'm gonna ask you do you believe that god is sovereign now if you don't believe that you're gonna have a hard time when god makes things happen you're all confused but nothing happens the prophet of god said nothing could happen to a christian that god hasn't pretended amen and there's some things brother brown said it's his opinion but i heard people some people say well that's brother brandon opinion but let me tell you brother and sister i'd rather live on what his opinion to follow along what these ministers have to say amen that's why i believe that he's god's prophet i don't care what the world said he was god's prophet to this third generation and i'm gonna follow him you say oh brother children you follow man you got that right i'm going to follow william bradley i hope everybody see that i'm going to follow william brown as he follow christ you say what you mean brother

believe something is telling me go around and love all your enemies especially your friends amen make sure you do what is right because i realize nobody could change you but god and i thank god for this revelation that he has sent in this hour do you appreciate the lord did you appreciate what he is doing amen so you realize that there is a purpose in your life do you realize that there's a purpose in your life so there's nothing that can happen by chance do you love him amen just appreciate him amen just put something here i don't know where to put it at but praise god let's turn to proverb of the 16th chapter proverbs the 16th chapter and verse 4 and it reads amen the lord has made all things for himself yea even the wicked for the day of evil so you you're getting upset and i heard people say well that's ashamed what he's doing that's a shame god knows that's a shame what he's doing he just did that my brother like that it's all in god's plan god allowed the spirit to be let loose of evil to get on people just make sure it don't get on you then make sure when they're doing your own you still love them a lot of people don't care about that brother steve a lot of people love you in a way oh i love brother steve in my past i tell you what i went out of church one time i was preaching and a brother said anybody bother without passing we'll mess them up brother we'll break the job on i said what kind of holy ghost do you have i said you know what you might be got the you might be goddamn oh i got the baptism the holy ghost i want doubt that you got the baptism in the holy ghost you can have it on your flesh 24 7. hello everybody but i want the passion of the holy ghost because you can't have the person without having a personality you love the lord tonight and the lord has formed all these things to happen for a purpose do you love the lord let's go to psalms 22 and verse 28. i love this one right here my this this is rich right here psalms 22 and verse 28. talking about the sovereignty of god and who is controlling earth affairs amen and before i read 28 let's just lay this in here it's so easily it's very easy as human beings we we we know you know if we go outside the wind blowing hall who lord that we're in this blowing hall we giving credit to god the sun is real high lord i thank you for the son you know god made his son the night fall the moon stars shine i thank god but when something happened would look like man man does a little tricky things and man does this and cause this to go wrong you say now look look look and it looks just like man got power right now that's wrong what he did how could he do all of that he don't got all this power now he just do it just like he wants you to throw the pole christians out he just said man he just do it he can't do no more than god allowed him to do god is releasing evil on this earth every spirit that come before comes in the presence of god do you believe that every spirit is subject to god so that that ought to help you to realize when trouble comes in your home do you realize that satan had to go up on heaven's door he wanted to go back over here so bad because he want to go to your home but he can't go he got that i need to go down there before they wake up [Laughter] heavenly father ain't moving but when heaven and father say what is your problem say can i go down there can i go down into such and such house i wanted a retorment there can i go to the house i just want to torment that dog in there i want to torment that sign in there i want to torment that husband like why can't i go and what the father said go because the sovereignty of god god allowed that demon to go and knock on your door and i'm going to tell you brothers and sisters no demon no devil could walk on your front part without getting permission from the almighty god so every trial that comes my way you know what i learned to say hallelujah in the house thank god for my trial i thank god for my pressure [Music] other day amen getting up in a little age i had to go to the doctor well that's all right you know what i'm saying well thank you jesus hallelujah i said you know what this

of the masses amen with the mask on his face and he said brother challenge i said what's wrong he said how do you know that about me i said brother i don't know nothing about you y'all need to learn when you come to church that the same angel that was with william branner is here today that angel ain't going nowhere that angel is hell glory to god all this going on all this fire but the angel of the lord is still here the angel of the lord is with the believer the angel of the lord if with us everywhere we go no one in david said yeah do i walk through the valley of the shadows a virus i

children be careful be careful somebody asked me what what how did it send me to church how far this in ah they can bring to take measure i think they're a little i think they're five five eleven and seven eight they need to be six feet according to the rules and the revelation of the law in north carolina come on come on i was in the grocery store when all this happened i was in the grocery store and this lady in front of me with a mask on her face and uh and and and somebody right right beside her to the next cashier and she was and i did and she was getting us stuff self-check out and i just she getting ready to leave so i just walked up my god i thank god for the holy spirit because his old flesh wanted to cut up she looked back with that mask on her face she said sir you need to get back over six feet you little too close and i say oh my god ain't man then my flesh want to rise up i want to say well what what about these people over here see we got to remember we got to know how the devil operates amen there ain't not but the devil fallen names just amen so i just been kind and i back up but what if i as a christian thomas i got the baptism in the holy ghost but ma'am ma'am well ma'am look at all these people what is that what is kind of christian is that that's the way that i know i just said i stood right there and wait on her then when she walked away she said thank you sir then i felt so small amen what does that act like a fool amen but i thank god in another incident with his fire say man and when the thing first came out i was in walmart everybody loved walmart i was in walmart and uh and i i wasn't wearing a mask because it wasn't law back then amen but i wasn't wearing a mask and this lady's about here from society and i just oh my god why did i call for i just said and when i did that like my god i mean you adjourned by yourself i mean and like people just losing their mind and look like the devil is putting the pressure on the people people kind of praise god no more people when they come to church now they got the temp before they come to church let me tell you what i'm not tipping i'm not going to do none of that i'm going to serve god i could go wherever god want me to go amen if god gonna be with me if god wanted me to sing when i went to africa during christmas if he wanted that plane to go down in that ocean i've been left here so i believe my hand my my body my mind my soul is in the hand of the almighty god my my do you love the lord do you love the lord oh my what was i amen and and and then i read psalm 22 and i didn't psalm 22 and verse 8 28 psalms 22 and verse 28 are you thereby saying amen it said for the kingdom is the lord and he is the governor among the nations my he's a governor among the nation i see my i was just thinking could it be if god gonna work all things out for his good so that being said you mean to say god is controlling the things that's happened in the political realm brother rob you you think god takes time to deal with politics my politics the pale horse rider you you think god releases things well you know when when we when we talk about politics and i'm not here with pastor steve to preach on politics but i just want to lay this in here god is controlling everything god allowed things to happen this got to be in play before that could happen and we just need to be patient on this coronal virus god is going to work something out for his good somebody the man said he told me he said how long do you think this is going to last i said sir i don't know he said something says it's going to be here uh never go away some first city when it first comes somebody said i predicted by june by june the 28th so what's the date the 27th so it's supposed to be gone by tomorrow see so i don't worry about none of those things if you're leaving the day tomorrow next month next year i just one thing i just gonna keep serving god are you with me i'm gonna treat seven god so god knows all things the beginning from the ending so if you look at amen god is controlling the the nation the government god of the lord god controlling them and you say i i don't know about you but you know when when we have this president let's say the 44th president what barack obama he stood up there and to this nation i'm not preaching politics but i'm trying to bring something barack obama said i swear so help me god and his his theme was it's time for a change now who ain't ready for a change everybody want to change maybe the gas will go down maybe the economy won't be so shaky everybody's ready for a change yes it brought on a change too what it did it brought on a chain but god allowed that president that 44th president to be in that chair amen to the law to be passed of luke 17 26 or 27 as it was in the days of noah so shall it be in the day when the son of man be revealed what was in noah day homosexuality are you hearing me so god is mindful of what's been happening god allowed that to happen amen so they usher in the same sex matter and see we should be much urgent getting ready to get out here because the bible says as it was in the days of noah so shall it be when the son of man be revealed god is revealing himself today the son of man is being revealed so those things has got to happen to bring everything together and i don't know about you i'm happy this happened i'm happy now i'm going to say something my you know what you say brother chisholm brother children how do you feel when you see two men together i say hallelujah we're getting ready to go glory to god so brother children you mean to say you see two men hugging and smooching one another you may say you love that stuff i ain't seeing that not seeing prophecy being fulfilled i've seen we getting ready to get out of here oh you're hearing me then what makes so good when uh brother bradley talked about them uh uh spoken word original see he talked about those two angels he said when that last angel go out to sea he said then that fight when it went when lord came out out of solid he said didn't the fire fall brother brown said watch those two angels let me tell you or robson ain't going off the scene billy graham just left off the scene you think i'm gonna walk around with madison on my shoulder you think i'm going to walk around with heavy on my shoulder you think i'm going to walk around got something on my heart and because that's something that me wrong i'm going to learn how to love her matter of fact i'm going to take a lie to a good steak meal why because i'm going to make this rapture god got it all in control so god rules and it reigns and he knows all things i don't know how long i've been here but let's just try to end with this right here oh my praise god do you love the lord and before i go there look at job look at job you say brother children i don't understand i mean we go to church not only did we go to church brother children we in a message church i mean we bleed the message we quote the prophet message we read our bible but while these testes and trials coming our way why why are we constantly going through so much every time i look around and think this it just battled this brother fighting against me and that's going wrong why why it's because god is building pressure god allowing pressure to come and i don't care how good you look like you're on this earth it's a come upon a time when god says it's time to go and test that home it's time to go test that family but i just want to tell you amen when god tell you know that when when those demons come knocking on our door you need to know that they come to your front door with fear you say what you mean brother children about that every time amen when when the enemy desire to come to our home when it goes in the presence of god and they get commission from satan amen they're going try your home with another test when those demons find out that they've got to go to brother steve how it's oh my god oh my god hello no no master oh please let me go to somebody else i want you to go test brother steve i want you to go test that little church down there no master master they pray all the time that people got a manifestation of the son of man in their life lord i don't want to go to their home again i don't want to testify but what if enemies have to come to our home and get permission and and and their fathers say did you not went to their home last week why do you want to go again the reason i go to their home because they don't bleed the message the reason i go to the home they don't read their bible say man they set up for over nights and then listen that movies out the movies and then oh father i just love satan and i just love to go to their home because they don't pray they don't dedicate their live day they go to they go to bed just listen that some song they don't listen at your message of you call the prophet but i thank god you could do all those things but when them test comes your way they say lord god let me be like job job was a perfect and an upright man one who fears god and he choose evil but here's joe just walking on there brother steve just doing a good thing amen just got through preaching a good sermon and everybody been healed and job just walking along and satan looking at him passing right by him amen ain't paying joel norton because he know he can't get job why because joe got a hedge around him you know why the devil can't make you turn back you know why the devil can't get you to dock this matter because you got a hedge around you and the devil can't get you he tried his level bad but let me tell you what you come from god and you're going back to god there ain't nothing can change you what you mean brother children i come from the very back part of god's mind the very brothers see the back part of god's mind as a thought as an attribute and now i'm in flash and then the end of a man the emerald man as paul said they're yearning for a body change i don't know about y'all but i'm getting sick and tired of this past house this pencil is getting old man parts falling apart pizza brother uh brother robin this past house getting old a few more days to be 60 years old i thought i've been sitting in hell with my feet crossed by now but god know what he's doing he's going to have me on this earth again on this earth until he gets me just like he won't what you got to do he got to get all of the greenness out of me because sometimes somebody tell me about my former church then i want to get an attitude what are they doing that ain't gonna work god god gonna let that work i mean i shouldn't be even worried about that i should be saying lord have mercy are you hearing me and lord have mercy we shouldn't thank evil of nobody you love the lord the gospel of john the 19th chapter and we're going to try to end right here by the heavenly law i just want to talk about the sovereignty of god i hope it's all right tonight now look at uh let's look at verse six it says when the chief priests therefore in the officer saw him they cried out saying crucify him crucify him pilate said unto them take he take him take ye him and crucify him for i find no fault in him the jews answer him we have a law you got a law and by our law he ought to die because he made himself the son of god when pilate therefore heard that said he was more afraid so he was he was afraid of what they were saying the media are you hearing me and went and went again into the judgment hall and said unto jesus which are thou but jesus now he actually jesus who are you and his wife i told him don't have nothing to do with that just man what do people want amen but jesus gave him no answer then said power unto him speaketh thou not unto me knowing thou not that i have power to crucify thee and have power to release the mind i didn't know power had all that power i did not i'm close and i don't want to
