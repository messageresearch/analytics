[29:24] may need a touch in their bodies this
[29:26] evening. So, let's keep them on our part
[29:28] as we go to the Lord this morning. Lord,
[29:31] what a wonderful, wonderful thing it is
[29:33] to be here in your presence this
[29:35] evening, Lord God, in the middle of the
[29:37] week, Lord. Give us a refill, Lord God.
[29:40] We just want to lay ourselves before
[29:42] you, Lord, humbly, and just ask that you
[29:44] come and give each one of us a touch,
[29:46] Lord God. Not just in our bodies, Lord,
[29:48] but in our spirit, in our soul this
[29:50] evening, Lord, we've come to hear your
[29:52] word once again, Lord God. And that's
[29:54] just the most precious thing in our
[29:56] lives, Lord Jesus, is to hear from the
[29:58] throne, Lord God. So Lord, we just want
[30:00] to cast away any thoughts that we have
[30:02] that may interfere, Lord, with our
[30:05] worship tonight, Lord God, and our
[30:06] attention to your word, Lord God. Let it
[30:09] just leave the building, Lord. And let
[30:10] us just concentrate on you, Lord God.
[30:13] May your spirit just come, Lord, and
[30:15] just fill this place, Lord God, where
[30:18] the maybe even the preacher just can't
[30:20] even preach, Lord, because it's just so
[30:22] strong, Lord God. Have your will, Lord
[30:25] God. Lord, we could use some miracles
[30:27] here, too, in this little building,
[30:29] Lord. So, we want to call on you for
[30:31] that as well, Lord
[30:33] God. We can we count it, Lord, that each
[30:36] one that's sitting here is already
[30:38] evidence of a miracle, Lord God.
[30:41] So we know that you're that you're able.
[30:43] You're still alive. You still do it,
[30:45] Lord. So we're just asking, Lord, have
[30:48] your will this evening, Lord God, in
[30:50] each life in the place, Lord, touch
[30:52] those streaming as well, Lord Jesus. I
[30:55] do have something I would like to bring
[30:57] before you this evening, Lord, in the
[30:58] form of a prayer request. It's a friend
[31:01] of mine, Lord, that I've been trying to
[31:02] get him here uh to come visit, Lord, and
[31:06] his wife just had evidence of some
[31:08] little mini strokes, Lord. They found an
[31:10] aneurysm. She's only 58. Lord, her name
[31:14] is Lisa. His name is David. Lord, you
[31:16] know who's on my heart. So, we just want
[31:19] to place them before you, Lord
[31:21] God. Touch the tithing, Lord, the
[31:25] offering. Lord, touch the building fund
[31:27] as well. Whatever you place on our
[31:29] hearts, Lord, we just ask, Lord God,
[31:32] that you use these things, Lord, for the
[31:34] furtherance of your kingdom and for the
[31:36] gospel sake. Lord, we love you, Lord,
[31:39] with all our heart, Lord God. We don't
[31:42] want to just come and ask for things,
[31:44] Lord. We want to thank you for what you
[31:45] do already, Lord. What you're doing
[31:48] right now tonight, Lord. We could see a
[31:51] miracle with this atmosphere tonight,
[31:53] Lord God. And we just want to yield
[31:55] ourselves to you. Bless the man that's

[39:58] Praise him.

[40:09] Let's give him a praise offering
[40:12] tonight. Glory to
[40:14] God. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Are
[40:19] you happy tonight? Ready for the word?
[40:23] We greet you all in the precious name of
[40:25] our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, both
[40:28] visible and invisible audience. Amen.
[40:31] Any family members here? God richly
[40:34] bless you and welcome to Spoken Word
[40:36] Tabernacle to our convention on
[40:39] Wednesday in the middle of the week.
[40:41] Good to see you, Sister Mill Miriam. God
[40:44] richly bless you. Praise God. The Lord
[40:47] have touched you. Good to see you.
[40:50] Amen. Glory. Glory.
[40:53] Hallelujah. Everybody clear with the
[40:56] purpose of God? Because I'm looking at
[40:58] the purposes of God. You are the purpose
[41:01] of God. Amen. It releases tension. It
[41:06] releases pressure from our life. Your
[41:09] prayer
[41:11] is answered.
[41:14] God will say yes. But if he says no,
[41:17] maybe it's not the time yet. Maybe your
[41:20] per his purpose is a little bit
[41:22] different than your purpose. That's the
[41:24] reason why he's saying no. But he has
[41:27] something better in the plan. And he's
[41:30] taking his time. He will make everything
[41:33] right in the right time. Amen. Glory.
[41:37] Glory. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. His BFF,
[41:41] his friend Lazarus got sick.
[41:44] How can you be a BFF to Jesus Christ and
[41:46] get sick?
[41:49] Amen. You should be immune. Amen. But
[41:53] brother Brandham say when I read in
[41:55] other quotes, brother Brandham say Jesus
[41:57] knew that Lazarus will get sick and he
[42:00] left.
[42:03] If you want me to, I can search the
[42:05] court and pull it up. So Jesus knew that
[42:08] brother that Lazarus will get sick. But
[42:11] instead of blocking that, Jesus left
[42:13] purposely
[42:15] and he let sickness strike
[42:18] for a purpose. How can you put that up
[42:21] together? You need to be in a certain
[42:24] level with God. Not a crybaby level now.
[42:27] A certain level because every everything
[42:30] is working together for good. You know
[42:33] that song. Praise him. You know you
[42:35] should do everything is working together
[42:38] for good. And it was for the disciple.
[42:41] So to strengthen the disciples, somebody
[42:43] must get sick.
[42:49] And without the sickness of Lazarus, you
[42:51] would not know that he is the
[42:53] resurrection.
[42:55] Because in Easter he just prove what he
[42:58] says that I am the resurrection. But we
[43:01] but before you even reach Easter first
[43:04] he must prove that he is the
[43:05] resurrection.
[43:07] Amen. Amen.
[43:10] Oh God God help me. I I I try to stay
[43:13] away from Martha because Martha is the
[43:15] one that has been brought up in John 11.
[43:18] So I try to stay away completely from
[43:20] Martha because if you try to open
[43:22] Martha, it's a whole different theme of
[43:25] what who is Martha. Usually we look at
[43:28] Mary. Mary, Mary was sitting at the feet
[43:30] of Jesus Christ. There is a whole
[43:31] mystery lock in with Martyr.
[43:34] Amen.
[43:36] Showing that you Let me leave it alone.
[43:39] Okay.
[43:42] So my wife is looking at me like please
[43:46] don't ask me that the Martyr home just
[43:49] leave Marta alone. It's a it's it's a
[43:51] deep revelation. You got to go through
[43:53] court court again. I was searching for
[43:56] something else and then I begin to see
[43:57] Martha. Martha Martha say my God. So
[44:00] there is something about Martha and he
[44:02] will strengthen you differently than you
[44:05] think because sometime we think serving
[44:07] the Lord is only being behind the
[44:10] pulpit.
[44:13] You see but it's it's all different
[44:16] thing all together. This message is so
[44:18] deep and powerful. Amen.
[44:23] Amen. Remember we have our question and
[44:25] answer this uh Saturday. Brother Robert,
[44:28] if you would please remember to send the
[44:31] the the reminder. I believe it's going
[44:33] to be at the same place that we usually
[44:35] do. It's a quarterly, so get there on
[44:37] time. The last question is tonight. I
[44:40] already pick up the question that was
[44:41] there. Basically, we still have old
[44:44] question. That one is for the couple
[44:45] meeting. So, you don't have to deal with
[44:47] it till May the the 10th. And remember
[44:50] with the couple meeting, we will do the
[44:54] uh Mother's Day in that day. So you free
[44:57] Sister Joanne on Sunday to organize
[45:00] everything. So sister Joanne will take
[45:02] care of you in May 10th and we couple
[45:05] everything together. And something else
[45:07] that you will only know when you get
[45:09] there.
[45:11] I won't say that you will only know only
[45:14] when you get there. If you get there
[45:16] then you will know something else that
[45:17] will take place there. I won't say it
[45:20] from the pulpit because we will announce
[45:22] it on Sunday but we will start it on
[45:24] Saturday. So I just leave it alone. So
[45:27] don't come and ask me or poke or play
[45:29] with my
[45:30] heer. You don't know the
[45:34] scripture. Go search the scripture. Play
[45:36] with the heer. What does it mean? So I
[45:38] it will explain you what your pastor is
[45:41] trying to say. Amen. So remember
[45:43] question and answer. You pray about it.
[45:44] So we get there. It's once every quarter
[45:47] and then we move on. So tonight I'm not
[45:49] the one preaching. Praise God. It's my
[45:51] night. I'm trying to catch up and relax
[45:53] and enjoy the service, too. So, we got
[45:56] brother Tony Allen preaching tonight. A
[45:59] singer, a deacon, a preacher.
[46:03] Amen. That's why one of the song uh
[46:06] request is for him. So, he's going to
[46:08] sing and then preach the gospel. He can
[46:11] do both of them. So, we go with forever.
[46:13] Good to see you. Only
[46:16] believe.

[49:32] [Music]
[49:34] You know, Brother Brenham talking about
[49:36] those old rugged soldiers on the cross
[49:38] that comes out on Wednesday nights.
[49:43] those rugged Christians.
[49:45] But I was thinking
[49:47] um to do a special and I and I was
[49:49] thinking today and I was like, you know,
[49:52] God do so much for
[49:53] us and and he he does things that he
[49:57] don't have to do. But but we are chosen
[50:00] tonight
[50:02] to be in the sheepfold
[50:04] to be amongst those people that he
[50:06] picked Yes, sir. to heal when they get
[50:08] sick.
[50:10] those people that he's picked to give
[50:12] direction to when they get lost. So, we
[50:14] a special group of people tonight and
[50:17] and and we we just don't thank him
[50:19] enough and and just just something as
[50:21] simple as the air that we breathe, you
[50:24] know, he he gives that to us and and and
[50:26] he don't have to do these things. So, we
[50:29] we just going to take a few minutes and
[50:31] just give him praise, the honor and
[50:33] glory that he deserves for ju just
[50:35] forget about everything that happened
[50:37] today. We're here for only one reason,
[50:39] that's just to lift up the name of
[50:41] Jesus. And and he he brought us this
[50:43] far. He he allowed us to come in this
[50:45] building tonight. So we going to forget
[50:47] about whatever took place before we got
[50:49] here. And we're not going to worry about
[50:50] what going to happen when we leave from
[50:52] here. Let's praise him right in here,

[57:04] I'm lost without him tonight.
[57:16] Musicians
[57:20] and we're lost without him tonight.
[57:24] Amen. Amen. We're like a sheep without a
[57:28] shepherd without him. That's right.
[57:34] I just want to say it's just a pleasure
[57:35] to be back here on convention night.
[57:39] We're glad to be in the house of the
[57:41] Lord and and and and you know, we always
[57:44] study and we we come up with material,
[57:46] but we don't know how it's going to, you
[57:48] know, come out. But we trusting and
[57:50] believing that the Holy Ghost is going
[57:51] to reveal what it is he wants to reveal
[57:54] tonight. Amen. And I believe that he
[57:57] will
[58:02] If you get your Bibles, we'll go to the
[58:04] book of
[58:07] Matthew and we're going back to chapter
[58:11] 22,
[58:15] verse 14.
[58:24] Yes sir. Hold that and let us bow. Let
[58:26] us
[58:27] pray. Dear Lord Jesus, oh God, we come
[58:29] to you, oh God, once more, Father, we
[58:32] come before you, oh God, trusting and
[58:34] believing that you met us here, oh
[58:36] Father, and we come to pull on your
[58:38] word, oh God, and that you will speak
[58:39] whatever that you will have to be spoken
[58:41] tonight, oh Father. Oh God, whatever
[58:43] situation in the building tonight, oh
[58:45] God, I pray that you will minister to
[58:46] it, oh God. But reveal your word to us
[58:49] tonight, God. Unfold the words off the
[58:51] pages tonight. Oh father, speak to your
[58:53] bride tonight, oh father. Oh Lord God.
[58:55] And then when we leave in here, oh God,
[58:57] we can testify, oh God, that you had
[58:59] came down and spoken to us tonight. And
[59:01] we can leave different than we came in
[59:03] here. In the mighty name of Jesus
[59:04] Christ, we pray. Amen. Amen.
[59:08] The book of Matthew, chapter 22, verse
[59:13] 14. For many are called. That's right.
[59:16] But few are chosen. Amen. And you can be
[59:19] seated.
[59:22] Praise God.
[59:25] My title for tonight will be the chosen
[59:28] ones part two.
[59:31] And we will try to deal with the
[59:33] revelation of identity.
[59:36] Amen. And the voice of God.
[59:39] Yes.
[59:42] For we go back to the book of Matthew
[59:44] and it says, "For many are
[59:46] called but few are
[59:49] chosen." And and and I I ask you a
[59:51] question tonight and and what what are
[59:54] you chosen for tonight?
[59:57] What did God choose you for?
[1:00:02] And we want to begin by going back to
[1:00:04] this quote question and answers in 1959.
[1:00:08] Yes, sir. Paragraph 123. Amen. It said,
[1:00:12] "Before there was a world, that's it.
[1:00:14] You were in God's thoughts." That's it.
[1:00:17] Amen. To give you the Holy Ghost.
[1:00:20] Because he knew Yes, sir. that you be
[1:00:23] wanting it. Amen. And he chose you
[1:00:27] himself. Yes, sir. Because you desire.
[1:00:32] So you had the desire.
[1:00:36] He chose you in Christ before you or
[1:00:40] Jesus, any of you was on the earth. And
[1:00:44] he sent Jesus to die. That's right. To
[1:00:47] prepare the way to send the Holy Ghost
[1:00:51] to bring you to himself. And brother
[1:00:54] Bren say, "hm, oh, that just I know I
[1:00:58] made this is the church. So I'm at home
[1:01:01] now." You see, you are. Oh, that is so
[1:01:05] rich to me to think it's not what I
[1:01:08] wanted. It wasn't my desires. It wasn't
[1:01:12] my will. It wasn't my choosing.
[1:01:16] I had not one thing to do with it.
[1:01:19] But before the war ever started, God saw
[1:01:22] us and put our name on the lamb's book
[1:01:25] of life.
[1:01:27] Before there even was a world, Yes, sir.
[1:01:30] talk about God. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:01:33] And we want to revisit the message
[1:01:35] perfect faith. Yes sir. Which is in 1963
[1:01:40] and it's paragraph
[1:01:42] 94. And brother Brenham says now watch
[1:01:46] now. And he said to us if ye abide in me
[1:01:50] Yes sir. In my word in you St. John here
[1:01:54] he says you can ask what you will it'll
[1:01:57] be done. Yes sir. Then recognize your
[1:02:01] position in the scripture as a believer.
[1:02:05] Yes, my brother. See, you got to
[1:02:07] recognize your position as he recognized
[1:02:10] his position. Exactly right. And we go
[1:02:14] on into the message, what was the Holy
[1:02:15] Ghost given for?
[1:02:18] And this was in 1959, paragraph 98. And
[1:02:22] he says, God was over us with Moses.
[1:02:26] That's it. in the burning bush, right?
[1:02:29] He fed us with mana on high, right? He
[1:02:32] walked with us for three years and six
[1:02:35] months here on earth, right? But now
[1:02:38] he's in me. That's it. It's not me that
[1:02:41] speaketh. Uhhuh. It's him. And he says,
[1:02:44] I know who he is.
[1:02:47] And he goes on to say, and I know who I
[1:02:50] am.
[1:02:52] He said, I ain't no more, but he is. All
[1:02:55] right. So, this is a two-fold revelation
[1:02:59] that God is dealing with right here. So,
[1:03:02] so God is saying it it's it's an
[1:03:04] imperative first that you must know who
[1:03:07] he is.
[1:03:09] You you you must have a revelation of
[1:03:11] who he is. That's right. And and outside
[1:03:14] of that, that that's not enough. You
[1:03:16] must have a revelation of who you are.
[1:03:22] Yes, sir. Amen. Now, last sermon we we
[1:03:24] we spoke about the sufferings and we
[1:03:27] dealt with sufferings and and and we
[1:03:29] went to first Peter chapter 2:e 19 and
[1:03:34] and and Peter says, "For this is thank
[1:03:36] worthy if a man for conscience toward
[1:03:39] God endure grief suffering wrongfully."
[1:03:42] Uhhuh. And then he goes on verse 20. He
[1:03:46] said, "For what glory is it when you be
[1:03:48] buffeted for your faults, you shall take
[1:03:50] it patiently?" That's right. He said,
[1:03:52] "But if when you do well and suffer for
[1:03:55] it, you take it patiently, this is
[1:03:57] acceptable with God." That's right. Then
[1:04:00] first Peter chapter
[1:04:02] 4 verse 12. Yes, sir. You got to say,
[1:04:07] "Amen." Amen. He says, "Beloved, yes,
[1:04:10] sir. Think it not strange concerning the
[1:04:13] fiery trial which is to try you." That's
[1:04:15] right. As though some strange thing
[1:04:17] happening to you. He said, "But rejoice
[1:04:20] in as much as you are partakers of
[1:04:22] Christ's sufferings." That's right. That
[1:04:24] when his glory shall be revealed, you
[1:04:26] may be glad also with exceeding joy.
[1:04:29] Yes, sir. So Peter saying, you got to
[1:04:30] find some happiness in this.
[1:04:33] And then he goes on and say, "If you be
[1:04:35] reproached for the name of Christ, happy
[1:04:38] are ye." For the spirit of for the
[1:04:40] spirit of glory and of God rested upon
[1:04:43] you. On their part, he is evil spoken
[1:04:46] of, but on your part, he is glorified.
[1:04:50] And if you don't mind, turn to First
[1:04:52] Peter chapter 5. Yes, sir. You going to
[1:04:55] need your Bibles tonight. Yes, my
[1:04:56] brother.
[1:04:59] First Peter chapter 5:10. Yes, sir. He
[1:05:03] says, "But the God of all grace, who
[1:05:06] have called us into his eternal glory by
[1:05:09] Christ Jesus," he said, "After you have
[1:05:12] suffered a while, after
[1:05:15] it's going to make you perfect." That's
[1:05:16] right. And it's going to establish you.
[1:05:19] That's right. It's going to strengthen
[1:05:21] you. That's right. And it's going to
[1:05:22] settle you. That's right. So Peter is
[1:05:25] saying these suffering is is is going to
[1:05:28] actually reveal to you who you are.
[1:05:31] [Applause]
[1:05:32] There's a purpose for this suffering.
[1:05:35] It's going to do two things. It's going
[1:05:37] to reveal Christ to you and it's going
[1:05:39] to reveal who you are.
[1:05:42] And this and this suffering comes to
[1:05:45] establish you and settle you. Cuz if
[1:05:48] not, you will you would believe in God
[1:05:51] one minute and then next minute you
[1:05:53] won't believe in it.
[1:05:56] He he will be God for for one situation
[1:05:58] and then the next situation he won't be
[1:06:00] God to you. So these sufferings come to
[1:06:02] settle you, to establish you, to
[1:06:05] strengthen you, so you can know exactly
[1:06:07] who he is so your faith won't waver.
[1:06:21] Chapter 11,
[1:06:23] verse 6.
[1:06:28] He says,
[1:06:30] "But without faith, it is impossible to
[1:06:32] please him." That's right. For he that
[1:06:36] cometh to God, Yes, sir. must believe
[1:06:39] that he is. I'm going stop right there.
[1:06:43] The first thing you got to have a
[1:06:45] revelation of who he is. That's right.
[1:06:49] and that he is a rewarder of them that
[1:06:51] diligently seek him. Now he's saying you
[1:06:54] got to have a revelation of who you are.
[1:06:57] So if you can catch a revelation of who
[1:06:59] Christ is and if you can catch a
[1:07:01] revelation of who you are, there's
[1:07:03] nothing can stand in the way of faith.
[1:07:07] There's no doubt can stand in between
[1:07:10] you and faith when you know who he is
[1:07:12] and you know who you are.
[1:07:14] Yes, sir. Amen. Amen. Glory to God.
[1:07:18] Amen. Let's turn to the book of Acts.
[1:07:20] Yes, my brother. Yes, sir. Chapter nine.
[1:07:27] Yes, my brother.
[1:07:30] Yes, sir. You got to say amen. Amen. And
[1:07:34] we know this story, but let's let's
[1:07:36] let's see what the Holy Ghost has to say
[1:07:38] tonight. That's right. Amen. And Saul
[1:07:41] yet breathing out threatenings and
[1:07:43] slaughter against the disciples of the
[1:07:46] Lord went unto the high priest
[1:07:50] and desired
[1:07:52] of him letters to Damascus. So so so
[1:07:55] Saul had a desire to do these things to
[1:07:59] to do what he was getting ready to do.
[1:08:00] He had a a desire. I'm talking about a
[1:08:03] passion.
[1:08:05] A passion. Come on now. He He was
[1:08:08] confident that this is what I want to
[1:08:10] do.
[1:08:11] He You couldn't talk him out of it right
[1:08:13] there. He He was real confident.
[1:08:17] He desired of him letters to Damascus to
[1:08:20] the synagogues that if he found any of
[1:08:24] this way, whether they were men or
[1:08:27] women, men or women, he might bring them
[1:08:29] bound into Jerusalem.
[1:08:31] And as he journeyed, he came near
[1:08:34] Damascus, and suddenly there shine round
[1:08:36] about him a light from heaven.
[1:08:41] So Saul didn't see nobody.
[1:08:44] It was a light.
[1:08:47] And he fell to the earth
[1:08:50] and heard a voice saying unto him, Saul,
[1:08:55] Saul, why persecutest thou me?
[1:08:58] And he said, "Who art thou, Lord?"
[1:09:02] Now, we talking about the same man. Yes,
[1:09:05] sir. That had a desire that had a
[1:09:08] passion to persecute the Christians and
[1:09:11] all of a sudden he calling out, "Lord,
[1:09:14] and and and the the only revelation he
[1:09:16] got to go off of, he only heard a
[1:09:18] voice." So So you mean to tell me this
[1:09:21] voice that came to him automatically
[1:09:23] gave him a revelation that that was
[1:09:26] Lord?
[1:09:28] [Applause]
[1:09:32] And he said he said, "I am Jesus whom
[1:09:34] thou persecuted."
[1:09:36] It is hard for thee to kick against the
[1:09:38] pricks. And he trembling and astonished
[1:09:42] said,
[1:09:44] his whole condition changed. I I want
[1:09:46] you to see this. He he went from being
[1:09:48] bold to persecuting the Christians. Now
[1:09:51] he in the presence of the Lord. And and
[1:09:54] when you get in the presence of God, it
[1:09:55] does that to you. He began to tremble.
[1:09:59] And he was amazed and said, "Lord, what
[1:10:01] would thou have me to do?"
[1:10:07] Now he you already know that he wanted
[1:10:09] to persecute the Christians. That's
[1:10:10] right. So the whole will Uhhuh. change.
[1:10:14] The whole will of Saul changed. Now Saul
[1:10:18] don't want to do his will.
[1:10:20] Now he asking Christ, Lord, what can I
[1:10:23] do for you?
[1:10:25] Did you notice a change? Now he wants to
[1:10:27] do the will of God.
[1:10:31] He said, what would you have me to do?
[1:10:34] And the Lord said to him, Arise and go
[1:10:36] into the city, and it shall be told thee
[1:10:40] what thou must do. Amen. Amen. And the
[1:10:43] men which journey with him stood
[1:10:45] speechless, hearing a voice, but seeing
[1:10:48] no man. That's right. So, so if these
[1:10:51] men was with were with Saul,
[1:10:54] that mean they had the same desire that
[1:10:56] he had.
[1:10:59] That's right. That they they they was
[1:11:01] with him. They had the same desire that
[1:11:05] Saul had. So why they didn't call him
[1:11:08] Lord?
[1:11:10] Glory to God. Why they didn't call him
[1:11:12] Lord? Many are called but few are
[1:11:16] chosen. He only chose Saul.
[1:11:20] They heard a voice, but Saul heard D
[1:11:24] voice and it came with revelation of who
[1:11:29] Christ was.
[1:11:31] And and and when God and see this what
[1:11:33] you got to understand, when God reveals
[1:11:35] himself, he automatically reveals you to
[1:11:40] you.
[1:11:42] He don't just reveal himself to you and
[1:11:45] stop.
[1:11:46] In the midst of him revealing itself, it
[1:11:48] also reveals to you who you are.
[1:11:51] [Music]
[1:11:58] It says Saul arose from the earth and
[1:11:59] when his eyes were open, he saw no man,
[1:12:03] but they led him by the hand and brought
[1:12:05] him into Damascus.
[1:12:08] And I want to skip over
[1:12:11] to verse
[1:12:13] um
[1:12:14] see go to verse
[1:12:17] 17. And Ananas went his way and entering
[1:12:21] into the house and putting his hands on
[1:12:23] him said, "Brother Saul, brother Saul,
[1:12:27] the Lord even Jesus that appeared into
[1:12:29] thee in the way as thou camest have sent
[1:12:32] me that thou mightest receive thy
[1:12:34] sight." Yes, sir. and and see and God
[1:12:37] was working on both ends. He he gave he
[1:12:40] gave Saul the vision of the land on the
[1:12:43] hands of Ananas and then he gave he
[1:12:45] tells him to go fulfill the vision. So
[1:12:48] God always works on both ends. Amen.
[1:12:51] And fulfill be filled with the Holy
[1:12:54] Ghost and immediately there fell from
[1:12:56] his eyes as it had been scales and he
[1:12:58] received sight for with and arose and
[1:13:00] were baptized. Yes sir. And when he had
[1:13:02] received meat he was strengthened. Then
[1:13:04] was Saul certain days with the disciples
[1:13:07] which were at Damascus. And straight
[1:13:09] away he preached Christ in the
[1:13:12] synagogues that he is the son of God.
[1:13:16] And so Saul lost his vision. It seemed
[1:13:19] like a bad thing, but it actually was a
[1:13:20] good thing. That's it. So in in losing
[1:13:23] his vision, he he found out who Christ
[1:13:25] was. And and then he also found out who
[1:13:27] he was. He found out through blindness
[1:13:30] that he was going to preach the gospel.
[1:13:32] He found out that he was the chosen one.
[1:13:35] So, so that's why these things come.
[1:13:41] It's a purpose for it. If you don't
[1:13:43] mind, turn to the book of Mark, chapter
[1:13:46] 5.
[1:13:58] Mark chapter 5
[1:14:01] verse
[1:14:07] 25 this is the woman with the issue of
[1:14:10] blood. Yes sir.
[1:14:13] Amen. And the verse 25 say and a certain
[1:14:16] woman which had an issue of blood 12
[1:14:19] years long time of suffering. This is
[1:14:22] this is this is 12 years of suffering
[1:14:24] and has suffered many things of many
[1:14:26] physicians and has spent all that she
[1:14:29] had and was nothing better but rather
[1:14:32] grew worse right and she had heard
[1:14:36] of Jesus
[1:14:39] came in to press behind and touch his
[1:14:41] garment. Now, she gathered up enough
[1:14:44] faith that if she could touch his
[1:14:46] garment that she would be made whole.
[1:14:49] But but it but it it didn't start at
[1:14:51] that garment.
[1:14:53] She had she had to believe that the man
[1:14:55] that had the garment on had so much
[1:14:58] power that that all she had to do was
[1:15:01] just touch the hem of his garment. So,
[1:15:03] so she she put faith in the garment
[1:15:05] because of the man that had the garment
[1:15:07] on.
[1:15:09] So, so she did she didn't waver with who
[1:15:11] Christ was. She she believed that he was
[1:15:15] who who she heard about. She heard about
[1:15:18] him and she believed that he was that
[1:15:19] man.
[1:15:21] But but remember what I told you that
[1:15:23] ain't enough just to know who he is. But
[1:15:26] but now she need to know who she is.
[1:15:29] [Applause]
[1:15:31] For she said if I may touch but his
[1:15:33] clothes I shall be made whole.
[1:15:36] And the Bible said in straight way, yes
[1:15:38] sir, the fountain of her blood was dried
[1:15:40] up and she felt in her body that she was
[1:15:44] healed of that plague. So that mean
[1:15:46] right then she had a revelation that she
[1:15:48] was already healed. And and we talked
[1:15:50] about this. She had no desire to have a
[1:15:53] conversation with Jesus. She had faith
[1:15:55] in the garment. She touched it and she
[1:15:57] felt the healing and she know she was
[1:15:59] healed. But that that's not all what
[1:16:02] Christ wanted to do for her. She
[1:16:04] believed in him but but Christ said
[1:16:06] that's not all I want you to do. I want
[1:16:07] you to know who you are.
[1:16:11] And verse 30 saying Jesus verse 30
[1:16:14] saying Jesus immediately knowing in
[1:16:16] himself that virtue had gone out for him
[1:16:20] turned him about in the press and said
[1:16:22] who touched my clothes?
[1:16:26] And his disciples said unto him thou
[1:16:28] sith the multitude thronging thee and
[1:16:30] says thou who touch me?
[1:16:33] And he looked around about to see her
[1:16:36] that had done this thing. But the woman
[1:16:39] fearing and trembling, see that's that
[1:16:40] presence of God again.
[1:16:43] The woman fearing and trembling knowing
[1:16:45] what was done in her came and fell down
[1:16:47] before him and told him all the truth.
[1:16:50] And and remember this woman was an
[1:16:52] outcast. She was an outcast. But she
[1:16:55] believed in Christ so much she pressed
[1:16:57] her way to him. She believed in him. So
[1:17:01] verse 34,
[1:17:03] and he said unto her, daughter,
[1:17:07] [Applause]
[1:17:12] say, daughter, thy faith have made thee
[1:17:15] whole. Go in peace and behold of thy
[1:17:19] plague. Christ could have let her walk
[1:17:21] away. She had already got her healing.
[1:17:25] He could have let her walk away, but he
[1:17:27] wanted to reveal to her who she was.
[1:17:32] See, she already know who he was. So
[1:17:34] Christ say, "I'm not going to let you
[1:17:35] walk away without revealing to you who
[1:17:37] you are."
[1:17:39] [Music]
[1:17:42] [Applause]
[1:17:49] And the message be searching
[1:17:51] God. Sir, you know it's a sc it's 1959
[1:17:56] paragraph 38. I'm sorry. Be certain of
[1:17:59] God. 1959 paragraph 38. Yes, sir. He
[1:18:02] said, you know, it's a strange thing.
[1:18:05] May God let this soak into every one of
[1:18:07] you. If you never hear me preach again,
[1:18:09] let this be a message. It's strange,
[1:18:12] most strange that sometimes that God
[1:18:14] does things that way. You know, when we
[1:18:17] have confessed our sins and met every
[1:18:19] requirement that God requires, we
[1:18:21] believe on God, there's a circumstances
[1:18:24] has to be met and it's according to his
[1:18:27] will. Uhhuh. And we've confessed our
[1:18:29] sins and we made all the wrongs that we
[1:18:31] have did right doing everything that we
[1:18:34] know how to do. Every requirement that
[1:18:36] God has made or asked, we have met that
[1:18:38] requirement. And yet, he lays silent and
[1:18:42] just won't answer us. Uh-huh. I'm sure
[1:18:44] that I'm speaking to people this
[1:18:45] morning. He said, "Who has come to that
[1:18:47] place?" He said, "I've been the
[1:18:49] prophecy. I've been there many times
[1:18:51] myself. When I went back and trace my
[1:18:54] life and turn over every stone and I
[1:18:56] find that I've did something wrong, I go
[1:18:59] confess it and say, "Lord God, I'll make
[1:19:01] it right and go do so." Then come back
[1:19:04] again and say, "Now Lord, thou are God.
[1:19:08] You will answer me. Surely I met every
[1:19:10] request that you required me to do and
[1:19:13] every requirement I have met it and
[1:19:15] still have still he won't move seems to
[1:19:18] set silent that's when you got to be
[1:19:21] sure that he is God
[1:19:25] don't be discouraged the only thing is
[1:19:28] that in your heart to be certain of God
[1:19:31] he said my text be certain first before
[1:19:34] you do anything be certain in your heart
[1:19:38] that is God. And when you met everything
[1:19:41] he said, then you are sure that he's
[1:19:44] God. That's when faith goes to work.
[1:19:47] Right there, faith stands steady for it
[1:19:50] knows that he is and you met every
[1:19:54] requirement you believe that he is. And
[1:19:57] faith holds steady. Oh, blessed be his
[1:19:59] name. Faith won't move, for it's sure
[1:20:03] that God is and it rewarders of those
[1:20:06] that diligently seek him. He said, "May
[1:20:08] this go way down deep and never move
[1:20:10] from you." Brandham tabernacle. He said
[1:20:12] if you met God's requirement and your
[1:20:15] heart you believe that he is God is only
[1:20:18] testing your faith for he loves to do
[1:20:21] that. He say you confess your sin and
[1:20:25] you met every requirement that God
[1:20:26] requires and still he lay silent.
[1:20:29] Remember faith says that he is. Then
[1:20:33] faith holds on to it. Not knowing what
[1:20:35] it's all about, but it knows that he is
[1:20:39] and it's certain that he
[1:20:41] is s in the message the Pat's vision
[1:20:46] 1960
[1:20:47] paragraph 135. Yes, sir. Brother Brown
[1:20:51] say all right the first of all
[1:20:53] revelations
[1:20:55] is the supreme deity of Jesus Christ.
[1:20:59] He said, "You must know who he is."
[1:21:03] And when you hear the voice,
[1:21:07] he said, "All right." The same voice
[1:21:08] that sounded on Mount Si, the same voice
[1:21:11] that sounded on Mount Transfiguration,
[1:21:14] the same one, one like the son of man,
[1:21:17] it was Christ in the pillar of fire. It
[1:21:19] was Christ in the cloud. It was Christ
[1:21:22] in Moses. And and and they tell him to
[1:21:25] say, "Don't let Lord, don't you speak.
[1:21:27] Let Moses speak." But if they would have
[1:21:29] caught the revelation, it was still God
[1:21:31] and Moses.
[1:21:34] They should have they should have feared
[1:21:35] Moses just as much as they fear his
[1:21:37] voice because it because his voice was
[1:21:40] God
[1:21:42] [Music]
[1:21:48] and the mighty God unveiled before us.
[1:21:52] 1964,
[1:21:53] paragraph 25. Yes, sir. Brother Brown
[1:21:56] says back in the Old Testament said we
[1:21:58] found that that found out that God
[1:22:00] availed himself from unbelievers.
[1:22:03] God has a very odd way of dealing with
[1:22:05] people. He hides himself from the
[1:22:08] unbeliever and he reveals himself to the
[1:22:10] believer. He say God does that. Jesus
[1:22:14] Jesus thanked the father that he had hid
[1:22:16] these things from the wise and the
[1:22:18] prudent and will reveal it to the babes
[1:22:21] such as we learn. So we find that God
[1:22:24] never changes in his nature. He always
[1:22:28] doing his work the same. Yes sir. We
[1:22:30] found out in Malachi 3 that he said I am
[1:22:32] God and I change not. So he works in the
[1:22:36] same principle all the time.
[1:22:39] Amen. Yes sir. Amen. And brother Brenham
[1:22:43] says in the in in the message the great
[1:22:45] shining light. He said oh in 1957
[1:22:48] paragraph 37 he said oh Christian will
[1:22:50] only do that. Now watch the stars, but
[1:22:54] watch God's word as it unfolded. And we
[1:22:57] will only notice it today and see that
[1:22:59] how God has promised in this day the
[1:23:02] things that we so gallantly stand for.
[1:23:04] God has promised these things such as
[1:23:07] healing the sick and doing the great
[1:23:09] miracles, right? And and and he like I
[1:23:12] said, when God reveals himself, he also
[1:23:15] reveals to you who you are. Yes, sir. It
[1:23:19] It's like It's like God moving on a man
[1:23:21] and and and and he say, "God has
[1:23:23] revealed to me who my wife is. God has
[1:23:26] showed me who my wife is."
[1:23:28] So if God revealed to you who your wife
[1:23:30] is, stay right there.
[1:23:33] In the midst of him revealing that to
[1:23:35] you, he must also reveal to that wife
[1:23:40] who her husband is.
[1:23:42] So he just don't re he just don't reveal
[1:23:45] to you who your wife is. When he does
[1:23:47] that, he already revealed who that wife
[1:23:49] is. He already revealed to her who that
[1:23:51] husband is for her.
[1:23:55] [Applause]
[1:23:57] [Music]
[1:23:59] And we as Christians, we we we got to
[1:24:01] change, you know, the way we talk.
[1:24:05] You know, God God has chosen us for
[1:24:07] these things. He chosen me for healing.
[1:24:09] I I know the scripture say ask for what
[1:24:11] you will. But some things the bride
[1:24:13] don't have to ask for it. You got to get
[1:24:16] to a point where you don't ask. I don't
[1:24:18] have to ask for healing. He already gave
[1:24:20] it to me. I just thank him for it.
[1:24:24] Brother B say if God come down right
[1:24:26] now, he can't heal you no more than he
[1:24:28] already did.
[1:24:30] So So why you asking for something that
[1:24:32] already belong to you?
[1:24:35] My job is to thank him for it and keep
[1:24:38] on walking. Just thank him for
[1:24:41] it. I don't have to ask for healing. He
[1:24:45] already gave it to me. All I got to do
[1:24:47] is say, "Lord, I thank you for the
[1:24:49] healing." And brother B say, "Take him
[1:24:51] at his word. Take him at his word.
[1:24:56] [Applause]
[1:24:57] [Music]
[1:24:59] [Applause]
[1:25:03] [Music]
[1:25:09] [Applause]
[1:25:12] Brother Butter Bon say what think he of
[1:25:15] Christ? Who who do you say that this man
[1:25:18] is? I ask you tonight, who do you say
[1:25:20] this man is? Is this man able to supply
[1:25:24] your needs?
[1:25:25] Is this man able to heal you when you
[1:25:27] need healing? Is he able to give you
[1:25:30] direction when you're lost?
[1:25:32] Do you know this man? I'm asking you
[1:25:34] now. Do you know this man?
[1:25:36] [Music]
[1:25:38] Brother Bham say what? Think he Christ.
[1:25:40] 1957 paragraph 26. He said we could go
[1:25:44] on and on and on. He said but let's just
[1:25:47] ask and get some scriptural authority
[1:25:49] for who Jesus Christ was. He said what
[1:25:52] think ye of him? He said of course his
[1:25:54] friends you say brother Brenham would
[1:25:56] testify him. He said, "Let's ask his
[1:25:58] enemies about him then. Let's see what
[1:26:01] the enemy says." He said, "The devil
[1:26:04] himself
[1:26:05] know that was the son of God." See, just
[1:26:08] confessing that he's the son of God is
[1:26:10] not enough.
[1:26:12] The devil confessed that he was the son
[1:26:14] of God.
[1:26:16] The devil knew he was the son of God.
[1:26:18] Just knowing that won't cut it. But what
[1:26:21] set us different between them is that we
[1:26:24] got a revelation of who he is and that
[1:26:27] we can take him at every word. And
[1:26:29] that's the part that the enemy can't do.
[1:26:31] He don't want to take him at every word
[1:26:33] because if he take him at every word, he
[1:26:35] got to be converted. And that's what he
[1:26:37] don't want.
[1:26:40] [Applause]
[1:26:44] Glory to God.
[1:26:45] Yes, my in the book of Acts chapter 19
[1:26:50] verse 15
[1:26:53] it said and the evil spirit answer and
[1:26:55] says Jesus I know
[1:26:58] and Paul I know he said but who are ye
[1:27:03] so he this spirit confessed that he know
[1:27:05] who Jesus is he confessed that and he
[1:27:08] also if you a believer he know who you
[1:27:10] are so how can the enemy know who you
[1:27:13] are and you don't know who you
[1:27:15] [Applause]
[1:27:17] [Music]
[1:27:20] [Applause]
[1:27:22] [Music]
[1:27:26] [Applause]
[1:27:28] in the book of Romans chapter 10 verse
[1:27:31] 9. It it says that if thou shalt confess
[1:27:34] with thy mouth the Lord Jesus which is
[1:27:38] what the enemy did and shall believe in
[1:27:40] thy heart that God have raised him from
[1:27:43] the dead thou shalt be saved and shall
[1:27:45] believe in thy heart that's the part
[1:27:49] the enemy can confess who he is
[1:27:52] hallelujah turn to the book of St. John
[1:27:55] chapter 9.
[1:28:01] Thank you, Lord.
[1:28:06] The book of St. John, chapter nine. Yes,
[1:28:09] sir.
[1:28:20] You got it. Say, "Amen." Amen. Amen.
[1:28:24] Chapter nine.
[1:28:27] It says, "And as Jesus passed by, he saw
[1:28:30] a man which was blind
[1:28:33] from his birth.
[1:28:35] And his disciples asked him, saying,
[1:28:37] Master who did sin, this man or his
[1:28:42] parents that he was born blind?" And
[1:28:45] Jesus answered, "Neither has this man
[1:28:48] sinned, nor his parents, but that the
[1:28:52] works of God should be made manifest in
[1:28:55] him."
[1:28:57] He said, "I must work the works of him
[1:28:59] that sent me while it is day that night
[1:29:02] cometh when no man can work." Right? He
[1:29:04] said, "As long as I am in the world, I
[1:29:07] am the light of the world." He said,
[1:29:09] "When he had just spoken," right?
[1:29:12] So Jes Jesus just he he basically just
[1:29:14] having a conversation, but he's not
[1:29:16] talking to the blind man. He's talking
[1:29:18] to the disciples.
[1:29:19] So he he spat on the ground. Yes, sir.
[1:29:22] And made clay of the spittle and he
[1:29:24] anointed his eyes of the blind man with
[1:29:27] the clay.
[1:29:29] And he said unto him, "Go wash in the
[1:29:30] pool of salom." Now I want you to notice
[1:29:33] at this point right here,
[1:29:37] this blind man never laid eyes on Jesus.
[1:29:40] That's exactly right at this point.
[1:29:42] That's exactly right. He never laid eyes
[1:29:44] on it. That's exactly right. And and he
[1:29:47] he he said unto him, "Go wash in the
[1:29:50] pool of salom, which which is by
[1:29:52] interpretation sent." Right. He went his
[1:29:55] way therefore and washed and came
[1:29:57] seeing. That's right. Now, when he came
[1:29:59] back, Jesus was gone.
[1:30:02] [Applause]
[1:30:03] He he he could he could see now, but
[1:30:05] Jesus wasn't there. So, so evidently he
[1:30:08] didn't see the man.
[1:30:11] He he never laid eyes on the man that
[1:30:13] anointed his eyes for his sight. Yes, my
[1:30:16] brother. And it says, "And the neighbors
[1:30:18] therefore and they which before has seen
[1:30:21] him that he was blind said, is not this
[1:30:23] he that sat and beg?"
[1:30:27] Some said, "This is he?" Others said,
[1:30:30] "He is like him." It looked like
[1:30:33] him. He say he say but but he said he
[1:30:37] said I am he yeah I'm the one. Yeah.
[1:30:39] Yeah it was me. You talking about a man
[1:30:42] happy that he can see. He said yeah that
[1:30:45] was me. He said therefore said they unto
[1:30:48] him how were thy eyes open?
[1:30:52] Who open? Who open your eyes?
[1:30:54] He answered and said, "A man that is
[1:30:57] called Jesus made clay and anointed my
[1:31:01] eyes and said unto me, go to the pool of
[1:31:03] Saleom and wash." And I went and washed
[1:31:06] and I received sight. They said unto
[1:31:10] him, "Where is he?"
[1:31:12] They want to know where he at. Uhhuh. He
[1:31:15] said, "I know not." See, Christ was
[1:31:17] gone. He didn't even know where he went.
[1:31:19] That's right.
[1:31:20] So they brought to the they verse 13 say
[1:31:23] they brought to the Pharisees him that a
[1:31:25] foreign was blind. So they took him to
[1:31:26] the Pharisees.
[1:31:29] Yeah. And it was the Sabbath day when
[1:31:31] Jesus made the clay and opened his eyes.
[1:31:33] Oh yeah.
[1:31:36] On the Sabbath.
[1:31:38] Then again the Pharisees also asked him
[1:31:41] how he had received his sight and said
[1:31:43] unto him, he put clay upon my eyes and I
[1:31:46] wash and I do see.
[1:31:48] Amen. Therefore it says some of the
[1:31:50] Pharisees, this man is not of God
[1:31:53] because he keepeth not the Sabbath day
[1:31:55] or said he can how can a man that is a
[1:31:58] sinner do such miracles and there was a
[1:32:01] division among them.
[1:32:04] Now what what part of them that didn't
[1:32:06] tell them that that nobody can do these
[1:32:09] type of miracles without God? They
[1:32:12] missed that part.
[1:32:15] And and Jesus told him, he he said, "If
[1:32:17] you don't believe that I'm he," he said,
[1:32:19] "At least testify that what I'm doing,
[1:32:21] I'm doing what they say I will be doing
[1:32:22] when I come." He said, "At least testify
[1:32:24] the works."
[1:32:26] And they and they said unto the blind
[1:32:28] man again, "What sayest thou of him?
[1:32:30] What what do you think of him?"
[1:32:33] And he had opened down eyes. He said,
[1:32:35] "He is a prophet."
[1:32:39] and and and and this was the pro uh the
[1:32:42] prophecy of Moses. I think I think it
[1:32:44] was in Deuteronomy. Moses prophesies
[1:32:46] with this prophet. That's right. But
[1:32:49] we're going to find out later on. And
[1:32:51] they say it was Moses disciples. But the
[1:32:54] Jews did not believe concerning him that
[1:32:56] he had been blind and received his sight
[1:32:59] until they called his parents to him
[1:33:01] that had received his sight. And they
[1:33:03] asked them, saying, "Is is this your
[1:33:04] son? He said, "Yet he um who you say was
[1:33:09] born blind, and how then do he now see?"
[1:33:12] His parents answered them and said, "We
[1:33:14] know that this is our son, and that he
[1:33:15] was born blind. But by by what means he
[1:33:18] know now seeth, he know not. Or who have
[1:33:21] opened his eyes, we know not. He is of
[1:33:23] age. Ask him, he shall speak for
[1:33:25] himself." Now see, his parents was being
[1:33:27] real smart about the answer. They they
[1:33:30] they answer, but they went, you know,
[1:33:32] they went around. They was real careful
[1:33:34] with their words.
[1:33:35] He say say these words spake his parents
[1:33:37] because they feared the Jews. That's
[1:33:39] right. For the Jews had agreed already
[1:33:42] that if any man did confess that he was
[1:33:44] Christ, he should be put out of the
[1:33:46] synagogue. So they were going to place
[1:33:48] you as an outcast. Therefore said his
[1:33:51] parents, he is of age. Ask him.
[1:33:55] And then they called again called they
[1:33:57] the man that was blind and said unto
[1:33:59] him, give God the praise.
[1:34:02] We know that this man is a sinner.
[1:34:05] Th this is the very Christ that walked
[1:34:08] before them and they didn't even
[1:34:10] recognize who he was.
[1:34:12] And and the blind man said he answered
[1:34:14] and said whether he be a sinner or no I
[1:34:17] know not. One thing I know that where is
[1:34:19] I was blind now I see.
[1:34:22] Then then they say to him again what did
[1:34:24] he do? What what did he do? How did he
[1:34:27] open your eyes? Come on man quit
[1:34:28] playing. Tell him tell us what he did to
[1:34:31] you. And he answered to him, "I have
[1:34:34] told you already and you did not hear.
[1:34:37] Wherefore would you hear it again? And
[1:34:39] will you also be his disciples?"
[1:34:44] [Applause]
[1:34:46] [Music]
[1:34:48] And they reviled him and said, "Thou are
[1:34:50] his disciples, but we are Moses'
[1:34:52] disciples." So if you was Moses
[1:34:54] disciples, Moses, Moses prophesied of
[1:34:57] this prophet coming.
[1:34:59] So you you mean you telling me you was
[1:35:01] disciple of Moses? So that mean you
[1:35:02] ain't following the full message.
[1:35:06] You're not following the full message of
[1:35:08] Moses cuz Moses prophesied of this. If
[1:35:10] you didn't know who he was, you should
[1:35:12] at least say what he prophesied that
[1:35:14] somebody was coming that was going to do
[1:35:16] these things. So So that's how people
[1:35:19] do. They follow the prophet, but they
[1:35:20] don't want to do everything that the
[1:35:22] message says do.
[1:35:25] [Applause]
[1:35:28] and and and the blind man verse 30 he
[1:35:30] said the man answered and said unto them
[1:35:32] why hearing is a marvelous thing he he
[1:35:36] said he said he said this is this is
[1:35:37] very marvelous this
[1:35:40] that you don't know hence he is
[1:35:43] and yet he has opened my eyes
[1:35:47] he say now we know that god heareth no
[1:35:49] sinners
[1:35:50] but if any man be worshiper of god and
[1:35:53] doeth his will him He hearing. Yes, sir.
[1:35:58] He say since the world began, was it not
[1:36:01] heard that any man open the eyes of one
[1:36:03] that was born blind? He said, if this
[1:36:05] man were not of God, he could do
[1:36:07] nothing. He said, they answer and say to
[1:36:10] him, thou was allto together born in
[1:36:13] sins, and do what thou teach us? So, so
[1:36:15] they tell him that, "Oh, you Oh, you a
[1:36:17] preacher now
[1:36:19] [Music]
[1:36:24] and and they cast him out."
[1:36:28] And and and Jesus and and and Jesus
[1:36:30] heard that they had cast him out. So now
[1:36:34] he's an outcast like the woman with the
[1:36:36] issue of blood.
[1:36:38] And Jesus when he had found him. So that
[1:36:40] mean Jesus went looking for him.
[1:36:43] [Applause]
[1:36:44] [Music]
[1:36:46] He went looking for him. And Jesus said
[1:36:50] unto him, "Thou has been, thou has both
[1:36:53] seen." No. Verse 36. No, verse 35. I'm
[1:36:57] sorry. Jesus heard that they had cast
[1:36:59] him out. And when he had found him, he
[1:37:03] said unto him, "Do thou believe on the
[1:37:06] son of God?"
[1:37:08] Now remind you that I said this blind
[1:37:10] man never laid eyes on Jesus.
[1:37:14] This is this is the first time he laid
[1:37:16] eyes on him. But that's right. It ain't
[1:37:18] like he knew who he was.
[1:37:21] If if he would have known we who he was,
[1:37:23] he could have said, "Hey, there's
[1:37:24] there's the Christ." But he couldn't do
[1:37:26] that because he didn't even know what he
[1:37:27] looked like.
[1:37:30] He didn't even know what he looked like.
[1:37:33] Take your time. And he said, "Do thou
[1:37:35] believe on the Son of God?" Yes, sir.
[1:37:38] And he answered and said, "Who is he,
[1:37:41] Lord?
[1:37:43] Yes, sir.
[1:37:46] He didn't know. He didn't know who he
[1:37:47] was at first. I know not who the man is,
[1:37:50] but all of a sudden, he have a
[1:37:52] revelation that he's Lord. And all he
[1:37:55] had to go off of was a voice.
[1:37:57] [Applause]
[1:37:59] He had no visual evidence that he was
[1:38:01] the Christ. It was the voice. God say,
[1:38:04] "My sheep knows my voice.
[1:38:11] [Music]
[1:38:18] Who is he?
[1:38:22] And it it's strange. It's strange that
[1:38:25] these these these men in the in the
[1:38:27] synagogue. Yes, sir.
[1:38:30] They were they Let's see what Brother
[1:38:32] Brenham said. Let's let's go to the
[1:38:33] message. Influence
[1:38:35] influence 1963, paragraph 205.
[1:38:40] Brother Bren, Brother Brenham says the
[1:38:42] blind man when he was healed. Yes, sir.
[1:38:45] He couldn't hold his peace. He said,
[1:38:47] "Why?" He was in action. He said, "Peter
[1:38:51] went in action. The woman went in
[1:38:53] action. The blind man, he couldn't hold
[1:38:55] his peace." He said, "Is this man a" and
[1:38:58] he repeating what they said? He said,
[1:38:59] "Give glory to God." That's what they
[1:39:01] told him. Who know this man is a sinner?
[1:39:05] in in paragraph 2 06 he said this is a
[1:39:07] strange thing that you all don't know
[1:39:09] who he is and being leaders
[1:39:13] so these men that Christ walked before
[1:39:16] that didn't catch a revelation of who he
[1:39:18] was these was actually spiritual leaders
[1:39:22] in the synagogue
[1:39:24] these were preachers preaching the word
[1:39:28] and didn't have a revelation of who he
[1:39:30] was many are called but few are chosen
[1:39:36] [Applause]
[1:39:38] [Music]
[1:39:42] In the book of Romans, my brother
[1:39:45] chapter 10 verse 13,
[1:39:48] it says, for whosoever shall call upon
[1:39:50] the name of the Lord shall be saved. And
[1:39:53] it says, how then shall they call on him
[1:39:56] and whom they have not believed? That's
[1:39:57] right. And how shall they believe in him
[1:40:00] of whom they have not heard? Right. And
[1:40:02] how shall they hear without a preacher?
[1:40:06] And how shall they preach except they be
[1:40:09] sent? That's right. As it is written,
[1:40:11] how beautiful are the feet of them that
[1:40:13] preach the gospel of peace and bring
[1:40:16] glad tidings of good things. Yes, sir.
[1:40:18] So now I'm I'm I'm beginning to wonder
[1:40:21] what what were they teaching? What what
[1:40:24] are they teaching in the synagogue? You
[1:40:26] don't even have a revelation. What what
[1:40:28] are you preaching? In in the book of
[1:40:31] Matthew chapter 7 verse
[1:40:35] 22 verse says many will say to me in
[1:40:38] that day Lord Lord have we not
[1:40:42] prophesied in thy name. That's right.
[1:40:44] And I and in thy name have cast out
[1:40:47] devils and in thy name done many
[1:40:49] wonderful works. And then will I profess
[1:40:52] unto them, I never knew you. depart from
[1:40:56] me, you that work iniquity. So So that
[1:41:00] mean they they they knew, right, but
[1:41:02] they chose not to do it.
[1:41:05] And and and verse 24 goes on to say,
[1:41:07] "Therefore, whosoever heareth these
[1:41:09] sayings of mine end doeth them, I will
[1:41:11] liken him into a wise man which built
[1:41:14] his house upon a rock."
[1:41:17] Amen. In the book of St. Luke 6 verse 46
[1:41:21] and it says, "And why call ye me Lord,
[1:41:24] Lord, and do not the things which I
[1:41:27] say?" That's right.
[1:41:34] He he he marked a believer, this blind
[1:41:36] man. So we going we going to go on to
[1:41:39] chapter 10 and and and and Jesus going
[1:41:42] he going to change the script. He going
[1:41:44] to he going to go into the parables
[1:41:47] now. Now he dealing with with another
[1:41:49] set of people, the unbeliever.
[1:41:53] He says, "Verily, verily, I say unto
[1:41:54] you," St. John chapter 10, sir, "He that
[1:41:58] enterth not by the door into the
[1:42:01] sheepfold, but climbth up some other
[1:42:03] way, the same as a thief and a robber."
[1:42:07] He said, "But he that enterth in by the
[1:42:09] door is the shepherd of the sheep."
[1:42:11] Amen. To him the portal openth, and the
[1:42:14] sheep hear his voice, and he calleth his
[1:42:17] own sheep by name, and he leadth them
[1:42:20] out. And when he puteth forth his own
[1:42:22] sheep, he goeth before them, and the
[1:42:25] sheep follow him, and for they know his
[1:42:27] voice, and and a stranger will they not
[1:42:30] follow, but will flee from him, for they
[1:42:33] know not the voice of strangers. He
[1:42:36] talking about a believer. He said, "This
[1:42:38] parable spake Jesus unto them, but they
[1:42:40] understood not what things they were
[1:42:42] which he spake unto them." So Jesus is
[1:42:45] going to repeat it again, but he he's
[1:42:47] just going to say it a little different.
[1:42:49] He says, "Verily, verily, I say unto
[1:42:51] you, I am the door of the sheep." And
[1:42:55] all that ever came before me are thieves
[1:42:57] and robbers, but the sheep did not hear
[1:42:59] them. He said, "I am the door. By me. If
[1:43:03] any man enter in, he shall be saved, and
[1:43:06] shall go in and out, and find pasture.
[1:43:09] The thief cometh not, but for to steal,
[1:43:11] and to kill, and to destroy. I am come
[1:43:14] that they might have life, and that they
[1:43:16] might have it more abundantly. He says,
[1:43:19] I am the good shepherd. He said the good
[1:43:22] shepherd giveth his life for the sheep.
[1:43:24] He said, but he that is a hireland and
[1:43:27] not the shepherd who's on the sheep or
[1:43:29] not, seeing the wolf coming and leaveth
[1:43:31] the sheep. You know what a hireland is?
[1:43:36] I'm just paraphrasing. It's just it's
[1:43:38] some it's someone who takes a position
[1:43:44] but don't be dedicated to the position
[1:43:47] and and and he takes the position
[1:43:51] for for all the wrong reason but for the
[1:43:54] concern of the sheep.
[1:43:58] I how take a position
[1:44:01] for material
[1:44:03] wages and gain
[1:44:06] have no concern for the sheep.
[1:44:10] And and what Jesus was saying, I am the
[1:44:12] good shepherd. I put I lay down my life
[1:44:15] for the sheep. I go before the sheep. He
[1:44:18] said, "But don't be like the hireling.
[1:44:20] Don't be over the sheep and don't have
[1:44:22] no concern for them." He said, "Cuz when
[1:44:24] the enemy come in to kill, steal, and
[1:44:26] destroy, that hardening is going to
[1:44:28] flee." He said, "But that good shepherd
[1:44:30] leaves the 99 and go get the one."
[1:44:34] That good shepherd leave the 99 and go
[1:44:36] get the one. He puts his life before the
[1:44:39] sheep.
[1:44:40] [Music]
[1:44:45] Praise God. Amen. Amen. Thank you, Lord.
[1:44:48] Amen. Glory to God.
[1:44:54] Amen.
[1:44:55] Amen. And if and if you notice, Jesus
[1:44:58] was all his his his purpose was to give
[1:45:01] you the revelation of who you are and
[1:45:04] who he was. Yes, sir. And he started
[1:45:06] with himself. And after his
[1:45:08] resurrection, he came to Peter you know
[1:45:10] he says St. John chapter 21 verse1 15 he
[1:45:14] says when they had denied Jesus said to
[1:45:17] Simon Peter Simon the son of Jonas
[1:45:19] lovest thou me more than these and he
[1:45:22] said unto him yeah Lord thou knowest
[1:45:24] that I love thee? And he said unto him
[1:45:26] feed my lambs.
[1:45:29] And he said unto him again the second
[1:45:31] time Simon son of Jonas lovest thou me?
[1:45:35] He said unto him, "Yay, Lord, thou
[1:45:37] knowest that I love thee." He said unto
[1:45:39] him, "Feed my sheep."
[1:45:41] And he said unto him the third time,
[1:45:43] Yes, sir. Simon, son of Jonas, lovest
[1:45:46] thou me? And Peter was grieved because
[1:45:48] he had said unto him the third time, he
[1:45:50] said, lovest thou me? And he said unto
[1:45:52] him, Lord, thou knowest all things. He
[1:45:55] said, thou knowest that I love thee. And
[1:45:57] Jesus said unto him, feed my sheep. Yes.
[1:46:01] So, so the sheep got to have a shepherd.
[1:46:07] Let's go. Let's go to this. The sheep
[1:46:10] got to have a shepherd. Yes, sir. And
[1:46:12] and and this shepherd must have the
[1:46:14] revelation
[1:46:16] of the good shepherd.
[1:46:19] He He must have that revelation of the
[1:46:20] good shepherd.
[1:46:23] And and and the message, the good
[1:46:25] shepherd of the sheep.
[1:46:27] Yes, sir. 1957.
[1:46:31] Paragraph 10, Brother Vernon says, and
[1:46:34] you know, if you were going out,
[1:46:37] especially in my country, he says, to
[1:46:39] have a little picnic, we just have to
[1:46:42] have a little shade to have a picnic. He
[1:46:43] says, he's now if a little tree had been
[1:46:46] stuck out last year by someone, he said,
[1:46:48] we couldn't have very much confidence
[1:46:50] that we'll meet much shade there. He
[1:46:52] said, but you go to where the big old
[1:46:55] stately oat stands. That's right. where
[1:46:57] the trials and temptations and the
[1:46:59] swinging of the limbs back and forth and
[1:47:02] back and forth has moved that old tree
[1:47:04] till them roots are way down deep in the
[1:47:06] ground. He's saying you could pretty
[1:47:08] well believe she is still standing
[1:47:10] there. He said that's the way I like to
[1:47:12] get an old God saved saint that's welled
[1:47:15] the storm. He's saying their roots are
[1:47:17] still holding deep in the love of God.
[1:47:19] He said what it means to get a person
[1:47:21] like that and have a little time of
[1:47:22] fellowship means so much. Yes. He said,
[1:47:26] "Now, it was a strange thing." Jesus
[1:47:28] said here in St. John 10, "I am the
[1:47:30] door." He said, "I always wondered how
[1:47:33] he could be a door and be a man." Uhhuh.
[1:47:37] He said, "That used to bother me." He
[1:47:39] said, "How could he be a door and yet be
[1:47:41] a man?" He said, "When I was over in the
[1:47:44] Orient, I found out what that scripture
[1:47:46] meant." He said, "Here, I am the door
[1:47:49] and all that comes before me is
[1:47:51] robbers." And then I wonder how that
[1:47:53] was. Uh-huh. And he says in the orient
[1:47:55] how they take care of their sheep. He
[1:47:57] said the shepherd brings them at in at
[1:47:59] night and he counts them everyone to see
[1:48:02] if everyone is in. He say if there's one
[1:48:06] missing
[1:48:07] he will not lay down until he goes out
[1:48:10] into the deserts or whatever he's hurted
[1:48:13] all day long and he will find that sheep
[1:48:16] lay it over his shoulders and bring it
[1:48:17] in. I talk about a good shepherd. He
[1:48:20] said, "Then when all is in the fold,
[1:48:22] then then the shepherd lays himself down
[1:48:24] at the gap. He He He is the door to the
[1:48:27] sheepfold. There's no other way." He
[1:48:30] say, "It's a quarrel. Got a top over it
[1:48:33] and nothing can come in to those sheep
[1:48:35] until it cross the shepherd." And I and
[1:48:38] I and I looked at a documentary on it
[1:48:40] and I was like, "Lord, what what is he
[1:48:41] saying?" So basically what he's saying,
[1:48:43] he these sheep are led in into this area
[1:48:47] and they're surrounded for protection.
[1:48:49] And he he leave this one little gap open
[1:48:52] and it's the only way in is the only way
[1:48:54] out. He said that one little gap that he
[1:48:56] leaves open, he said that is where the
[1:48:58] shepherd seeks at. So so so that the
[1:49:01] enemy can't get in. So he plugs himself
[1:49:04] in the gap.
[1:49:06] Yes, sir. Amen. And he says, "And what a
[1:49:09] relief, what a lovely thing to know that
[1:49:11] when we are tucked into his blessed
[1:49:13] keeping, he becomes the door. And
[1:49:16] there's nothing could happen to you." He
[1:49:18] said, "No matter what it is, it all has
[1:49:21] to come by the shepherd. If it's
[1:49:23] sickness, it might be for your
[1:49:24] correction, but it might be for a
[1:49:26] testimony against the enemy. It might be
[1:49:28] for the exaltation of Christ's name." He
[1:49:31] said, "But nothing could come to you
[1:49:32] except he permits it to come." He's the
[1:49:34] door to the sheepfold. He said all that
[1:49:37] comes are robbers. All that ever comes
[1:49:39] to him trying to get you. He said trying
[1:49:42] to take you out of his fold is robbers,
[1:49:45] evil ones trying to take you from his
[1:49:47] fold. But they cannot get you. He says,
[1:49:49] he said, I just love to bleak that out.
[1:49:52] Nothing can bother you if you are in
[1:49:53] God's sheepfold. He said, for he is the
[1:49:56] door himself, and there's no other way.
[1:49:59] Everything has to be permitted by him.
[1:50:02] That's right. He say sometimes you say,
[1:50:04] why do I get sick? Uh-huh. It may be for
[1:50:07] his glory. He said, "One time when they
[1:50:10] were passing, you know, you're talking
[1:50:11] about the blind man, the disciples said,
[1:50:13] who sin, this man or his parents?" And
[1:50:15] Jesus said, "In this case, neither sin
[1:50:18] or his parents, but that the works of
[1:50:20] God might be made manifest." He said,
[1:50:22] "Little did he know if through his
[1:50:25] youthful days being blind, he was born
[1:50:28] blind, and through his youthful days, it
[1:50:30] might have been hard for him to
[1:50:32] understand." He said, "But after a
[1:50:34] while, he finds out it was a for a
[1:50:36] testimony of the Lord Jesus." Now, God
[1:50:39] does things like that.
[1:50:42] And I I remember reading when brother
[1:50:44] Brenham was saying how God introduces
[1:50:47] himself to people. Yes, sir. He
[1:50:49] introduces himself to the believers. And
[1:50:51] when when he felt led to go to the well
[1:50:54] to meet the Samaritan woman,
[1:50:57] Brother Baron said he picked that
[1:50:59] Samaritan woman. She she would she would
[1:51:02] he introduced himself to her to
[1:51:05] introduce himself to all the Samaritans.
[1:51:09] He picked one Samaritan to introduce
[1:51:12] himself to introduce himself to the
[1:51:13] whole race of Samaritan.
[1:51:16] So, so this is what he came to do to
[1:51:17] introduce himself to the believers.
[1:51:21] Thank you, Lord. Paragraph 14, he says,
[1:51:24] "And God selected the great shepherd of
[1:51:26] the flock, the Lord Jesus, and gave him
[1:51:29] all the authority Now, another thing,
[1:51:31] before he can go to leading his sheep,
[1:51:34] the sheep has to know the shepherd's
[1:51:36] voice.
[1:51:38] And another shepherd could call, that
[1:51:40] sheep would never listen to him. He
[1:51:42] would never pay any attention to any
[1:51:44] shepherd but that one. And brother Ben
[1:51:47] said, "When God calls a shepherd, say he
[1:51:49] already called some sheep for that
[1:51:51] shepherd." So it ain't no coincidence
[1:51:54] that you here tonight. There's no
[1:51:56] coincidence that you were hearing spoken
[1:51:58] word tonight. Cuz once he called brother
[1:52:00] Stephen, he also called some sheep for
[1:52:02] that shepherd.
[1:52:05] And he also said when he called you to
[1:52:07] be a part of the sheepfold, he already
[1:52:09] ordained a shepherd for you.
[1:52:12] [Applause]
[1:52:14] Yes, sir. Thank you, Lord. Amen. And he
[1:52:17] says in the natural realm if something
[1:52:19] happens to the shepherd and he's fired
[1:52:21] or sent away on what a time a sheep ra
[1:52:24] ra ra ra ra ra ra ra ra ra ra ra ra ra
[1:52:24] ra ra ra ra ra ra razor has in those
[1:52:25] countries to find someone to take care
[1:52:27] of these sheep again. He must this
[1:52:29] shepherd must be gentle, right? He must
[1:52:32] be loving. He must have a certain kind
[1:52:35] of voice. Jesus said he said my sheep
[1:52:38] hear my voice. What other voice can he
[1:52:40] have but the voice of God?
[1:52:42] [Music]
[1:52:44] He said, "My sheep hear my word."
[1:52:47] Anything outside of it, they'll not
[1:52:49] follow. So believe So believing that
[1:52:52] Christ that Christ was um Jesus was the
[1:52:54] son of Christ ain't enough. A believer
[1:52:57] will hold on every word. They will hold
[1:53:00] true to every word.
[1:53:03] And he said that the true shepherd lays
[1:53:05] down his life for the sheep. And he also
[1:53:07] said the hireland shepherd won't listen.
[1:53:11] He would run away and leave the sheep.
[1:53:14] So, hallelujah. So, I'm thinking about
[1:53:16] these preachers in the synagogue.
[1:53:18] They had no revelation of who Christ
[1:53:20] was. And the first thing they did was
[1:53:23] put the man out, right? They they they
[1:53:26] place placed him in an outcast status
[1:53:28] because they originally didn't have a
[1:53:30] revelation of who Christ was. So, so
[1:53:33] that's that's why he says many are
[1:53:35] called, few are chosen. And to be that
[1:53:37] shepherd, you first must have a
[1:53:39] revelation of who Christ is. Like they
[1:53:40] say, how will they know except a
[1:53:42] preacher show them? And if you don't
[1:53:44] have that revelation, you can't preach
[1:53:46] that revelation to them. But I don't
[1:53:47] know about you tonight, but I'm so glad
[1:53:49] that we got a shepherd tonight. That we
[1:53:52] got a shepherd tonight to have the
[1:53:54] revelation of Jesus Christ. And I'm so
[1:53:57] glad that I've been chosen to be a sheep
[1:54:00] in the sheepfold to be to be a sheep in
[1:54:03] the number that I can receive the
[1:54:04] revelation because he's been chosen. He
[1:54:07] been called. He's been picked and he
[1:54:09] would not leave the sheep wounded. He
[1:54:10] will lay his life down for the sheep. He
[1:54:12] will go before the sheep. And when one
[1:54:14] is lost, he will go find them. He will
[1:54:16] go get him. He got a different
[1:54:18] revelation.
[1:54:20] [Applause]
[1:54:24] Thank you, Lord. Yes, sir. Thank you,
[1:54:26] Lord. And the in the second half of that
[1:54:29] scripture, like we said, the the second
[1:54:31] fold of it, you got to know who you are.
[1:54:34] You got to know who you are. That's
[1:54:36] right. And brother Benham, Brother
[1:54:38] Brenham was talking about a talking
[1:54:40] about remember the little the story the
[1:54:42] little boy that that went and looked in
[1:54:44] the mirror that never seen himself
[1:54:46] before. Say he walked up to the mirror
[1:54:48] and uh you know he he seen he seen
[1:54:51] another little boy in the mirror. Say
[1:54:54] say he waved his hand, right? Say the
[1:54:56] little boy waved his hand back. So So he
[1:54:59] checked him again. Say he pulled on his
[1:55:00] ear and say little boy pull on his ear
[1:55:02] and say finally he got close and say he
[1:55:04] got a revelation. He called his mom and
[1:55:06] said, "Mama, that's me." And and and you
[1:55:10] got to look in the word. You got to
[1:55:12] identify yourself in the word and you
[1:55:14] got to say, "Hey, that is me." When
[1:55:18] Christ promises you healing, you got to
[1:55:20] look at the scripture. Say, "He's
[1:55:21] talking to me.
[1:55:23] Every promise in the book belongs to
[1:55:25] you. But you got to know who you are. He
[1:55:27] said, "Ye are gods tonight." When I see
[1:55:30] that scripture, I say, "Hey, that is
[1:55:32] me."
[1:55:35] Let us stand.
[1:55:38] [Music]
[1:55:40] You got to know who you are tonight. You
[1:55:42] got to You got to have a revelation of
[1:55:44] who Christ is. And you got to know who
[1:55:46] you are. All right. And that open the
[1:55:49] doors for faith to take in action to set
[1:55:51] in action and then that kills all doubt
[1:55:54] because the two the major two
[1:55:56] revelations you have you have received a
[1:55:58] revelation of the enemy can't enemy
[1:56:01] can't pull you to and fro. Amen. Because
[1:56:04] those two revelation cast out doubt.
[1:56:07] Amen. Those two revelation That's right.
[1:56:09] is what makes you stick your chest out
[1:56:12] with confident. Jes Jesus didn't Jesus
[1:56:15] didn't ask God to hear his prayer. He
[1:56:17] said, "I already know you heard my
[1:56:18] prayer because he knew who he was." He
[1:56:21] knew who the father was. He knew who he
[1:56:23] was. And you got to have that same
[1:56:25] confidence tonight that you know who he
[1:56:27] is. And then true in your heart that you
[1:56:29] know that you are a God and with that
[1:56:32] revelation there's no doubt that can
[1:56:34] stand in between.
[1:56:37] Let us
[1:56:38] rule. Dear heavenly father, oh God, oh
[1:56:42] Lord God, we have received your word
[1:56:44] tonight, oh father. Oh Lord God, you
[1:56:46] have came and walked the earth, oh God,
[1:56:48] for three years and six months, oh
[1:56:50] father, and oh God, and you constantly
[1:56:53] reveal yourself to the believers and you
[1:56:55] hid yourself from the unbelievers, oh
[1:56:58] Lord God. But thank God tonight. We was
[1:57:00] chosen not then, oh God, but before the
[1:57:02] foundation of the world. And and we have
[1:57:04] a revelation of who your voice is. And
[1:57:07] when you speak, oh God, we hear the
[1:57:09] voice. And when you have spoken, oh God,
[1:57:11] we have heard the voice. And we thank
[1:57:12] you for that revelation, oh God, that
[1:57:14] you have chosen us tonight to to receive
[1:57:16] all revelations, oh God. You have picked
[1:57:19] us tonight, oh God, to go back inside of
[1:57:21] you, oh Father. And we'll thank you
[1:57:23] tonight, oh God, that we are special
[1:57:24] people tonight. Oh God, if we can just
[1:57:26] believe, oh God, and just know who we
[1:57:28] are tonight, oh Lord God, we will grab
[1:57:30] up enough faith to to produce a rapture,
[1:57:33] oh God, and we can leave out of here. Oh
[1:57:35] father, it takes that kind of revelation
[1:57:37] to produce a rapture. Father, we must
[1:57:39] know who you are and we must realize who
[1:57:41] we are. And in doing so, we can take a
[1:57:44] rapture. Oh God, Lord God, Enoch knew
[1:57:46] who you were, oh God. And Enoch knew who
[1:57:49] he was. And in being so, oh God, he had
[1:57:51] a pull for something that never existed,
[1:57:53] oh God, to take a rapture, oh father.
[1:57:56] And that's the kind of faith that we
[1:57:57] want tonight, oh Father. And we need
[1:57:59] that tonight, oh God. We pray that oh
[1:58:00] God if anybody liking that kind of faith
[1:58:03] oh God that you would penetrate their
[1:58:04] heart tonight oh God and reveal yourself
[1:58:06] to them oh Lord God and reveal to him
[1:58:08] who they are oh Lord God that we can
[1:58:10] take a rapture and get out of here oh
[1:58:12] father Lord God we commit this sermon
[1:58:14] into your hands oh God we thank you for
[1:58:16] all things in Jesus Christ's name we
[1:58:18] pray amen
[1:58:21] give the Lord a hand clap of
[1:58:27] praise amen Amen. Thank you. Thank you.
[1:58:31] Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Glory to God.
[1:58:35] Two things. Amen. You got to know who
[1:58:40] God is. And you got to know who you are.
[1:58:44] Oh, praise God. Praise God. It is so
[1:58:48] clear, so simple laid out. So clear in
[1:58:51] the scripture that you cannot even miss.
[1:58:54] He went from one example to the other
[1:58:56] and the Holy Spirit lay out everything
[1:58:59] so clear. Amen. You saw the blind man
[1:59:03] the first time when they asked him, he
[1:59:05] says he is a prophet.
[1:59:08] If you look at the scripture, he say he
[1:59:11] is a prophet. And Jesus waited until
[1:59:14] they cast him out.
[1:59:17] Because when they cast him out, then
[1:59:18] he's good to listen.
[1:59:23] [Laughter]
[1:59:26] Brother Brandham preached the message
[1:59:28] going beyond the camp.
[1:59:32] So if you want to find them, you got to
[1:59:34] find them beyond the camp. Jesus never
[1:59:37] moved back to find this man until they
[1:59:40] cast him out. That's what the Bible
[1:59:42] says. I was just I'm just listening. I'm
[1:59:45] just going to what he he already
[1:59:47] preached. Amen. The Bible say when Jesus
[1:59:49] heard so Jesus was waiting. He say he's
[1:59:52] still part of it. He's still part of it.
[1:59:54] Oh, they cast him out. Praise God. Now I
[1:59:58] can go talk to him.
[2:00:00] And if you notice, it was not him that
[2:00:02] found Christ.
[2:00:04] Watch the scripture, my friend. It was
[2:00:06] Jesus that now begin to look for him.
[2:00:10] After he was cast out, Jesus begin to
[2:00:13] look for him. And I was waiting for
[2:00:16] brother Tony to finish the scripture and
[2:00:18] for some reason he did it.
[2:00:21] Do you mind if I finish it?
[2:00:24] Do you mind if I finish it? I was just
[2:00:26] waiting. I was like, "Come on, come on.
[2:00:27] Come on. 36 35 36." And he move on to
[2:00:31] another. I'm sorry. I'm just going to
[2:00:33] read it. I just can't help it. Amen. It
[2:00:36] will it is so beautiful. You read this
[2:00:39] scripture over and over and before you
[2:00:41] know it, you begin to see things
[2:00:43] differently. Amen. It's in verse 35.
[2:00:46] That's where brother Tony stop. The
[2:00:48] Bible says that Jesus heard that he had
[2:00:51] cast him up, that they had cast him out,
[2:00:54] and when he had found him.
[2:00:59] Let me make this clear. I'm not trying
[2:01:01] to preach another message. I'm just
[2:01:03] going with what the brother already laid
[2:01:05] up, but it's something that just came
[2:01:08] straight right there. Go to verse 17.
[2:01:13] Oh, glory to God. When a minister begin
[2:01:16] to touch stuff like this, he begin to
[2:01:18] open up things. You just say, "Oh, glory
[2:01:21] to God." The Bible say, "They say unto
[2:01:23] the blind man again, what say thou of
[2:01:26] him that he has opened thine eyes?" He
[2:01:29] said, "He is
[2:01:32] a prophet, not the prophet."
[2:01:39] Remember the woman at the well at first
[2:01:42] say I see that I perceive that you are.
[2:01:47] So Jesus have to move with her from a
[2:01:50] prophet to a higher revelation.
[2:01:53] Amen. Now in verse 35 Christ came to
[2:01:57] find him. The Bible says in verse 35
[2:02:00] Jesus heard that he had cast that they
[2:02:02] had cast him out. And when he had found
[2:02:04] him, he say unto him, "Do thou believe
[2:02:08] on the Do you know what the son of God
[2:02:11] means?" Right? That's why they want to
[2:02:12] kill Jesus Christ because of the son of
[2:02:14] God. The son of God means God.
[2:02:18] Amen. Verse 36. And he answer and say,
[2:02:22] "Who is he, Lord?" This is where he
[2:02:24] stopped. "Who is he Elohim?"
[2:02:27] Yes. "That I may believe on him."
[2:02:32] Verse 37. And Jesus say unto him, thou
[2:02:36] has both seen him.
[2:02:40] The first time you heard it, now that
[2:02:43] have both seen him, and it is he that
[2:02:46] has talked with thee. In other words,
[2:02:49] the personal revelation of Jesus Christ
[2:02:52] right there revealed directly to him.
[2:02:55] Verse 38, and he said, Lord,
[2:03:00] I
[2:03:02] not for just a miracle now. Now I
[2:03:05] believe and he did what?
[2:03:09] He Oh Israel.
[2:03:12] You only worship one God. Amen. So in
[2:03:15] other word he came to the final point
[2:03:18] the absolute the revelation that this
[2:03:21] man is God and they seal his story in
[2:03:25] the scripture. You got to know who God
[2:03:28] is and you got to know who you are.
[2:03:31] Amen. God came in this end time and came
[2:03:35] searching for you and God find you and
[2:03:38] God told you who you are. And God told
[2:03:41] you for four, five months. He keep
[2:03:43] repeating that you are God. You are the
[2:03:46] same breed as I am. You came from God.
[2:03:49] You have been predestinated to be
[2:03:52] conformed to my own image because I'm
[2:03:55] the first among many brethren. You are
[2:03:58] just like me. But now you need to know
[2:04:01] who you are. Because when you know who
[2:04:03] you are, the problem between your
[2:04:05] relationship and God is solved. Because
[2:04:08] the difficulty you're not sure who God
[2:04:10] is for you. There is a diffic I mean if
[2:04:14] you go in a store and you find a man in
[2:04:16] a store and you talk to him you are
[2:04:17] limited because you don't you don't have
[2:04:20] an established relationship but the
[2:04:22] relationship you have in this church you
[2:04:24] can easily call brother Khalim at 2:00
[2:04:27] and he won't get mad because brother
[2:04:29] Khala will look at your phone call and
[2:04:31] say oh this is brother Zach relationship
[2:04:34] open up doors so when you know who God
[2:04:37] is and who you are and the relationship
[2:04:40] between you and God. Now you know you
[2:04:43] have confidence. Now you have faith like
[2:04:45] brothers preach. Now you know when you
[2:04:48] are approaching you know who you are
[2:04:50] approaching who you talking to. There is
[2:04:53] no better friend like Jesus Christ.
[2:04:55] There is no one that you can explain
[2:04:57] your problem so plainly without any
[2:05:00] problem like the Lord Jesus Christ. It
[2:05:03] is Jesus Christ. Amen. Remember who you
[2:05:06] are. God bless you. Let's pray. Heavenly
[2:05:09] Father, Lord, we approaching you again
[2:05:11] humbly
[2:05:12] tonight. Father, we thank you for
[2:05:15] speaking to our soul and blessing us
[2:05:17] tonight, Lord. Father, to know who you
[2:05:21] are and who we are, Lord. Father, your
[2:05:25] prophet say that when two omnipotent
[2:05:27] meet, the miraculous must take place.
[2:05:31] Your omnipotence has already been proven
[2:05:34] throughout the ages. You are omnipotent,
[2:05:37] God. But Lord Father, the problem was on
[2:05:40] our
[2:05:41] side to believe and to recognize that we
[2:05:45] are also omnipotent. That's where the
[2:05:47] devil has been working so much on our
[2:05:51] failure, on our weakness to discourage
[2:05:54] us to come and to climb to that
[2:05:56] revelation. But father, you came back
[2:05:58] tonight again to show us that we are
[2:06:01] sons. We are daughter of God. Lord, you
[2:06:04] don't just stop about healing us,
[2:06:06] blessing us, attending to our need,
[2:06:08] Lord, but you go further than that to
[2:06:11] make sure that we realize who we are
[2:06:14] because there is a power in that
[2:06:16] identity to know who we are, Lord.
[2:06:18] Father, may you help each one of us
[2:06:20] tonight. May no one miss that
[2:06:22] revelation, Lord, because the time is
[2:06:25] getting very tight. Things are tumbling
[2:06:27] left and right. People all over the
[2:06:30] world are going crazy. There is pressure
[2:06:32] here, pressure on the trade, pressure on
[2:06:35] the tariff. All kind of stuff is turned
[2:06:37] upside and down, war here and war there.
[2:06:40] And the time is coming, Lord. Father,
[2:06:42] that we must depend on the God that we
[2:06:45] serve for so long. The one that created
[2:06:49] us, the one that sent us here for a
[2:06:51] purpose, the time of the third full
[2:06:54] manifestation
[2:06:55] have come. Lord, Father, help each one
[2:06:58] of us to remember who we are. that we
[2:07:01] are not the children of chos and elab
[2:07:04] Lord but we are children of almighty God
[2:07:08] children of the most high one Lord that
[2:07:10] the hour is coming that the son of God
[2:07:13] must be manifested because this is what
[2:07:15] creation has been waiting all along Lord
[2:07:19] father may you bless our brother and
[2:07:20] strengthen him Lord remember him and the
[2:07:23] family Lord Father and protect each one
[2:07:25] of us and give us travel mercy as we go
[2:07:28] into our respective place and if time
[2:07:31] terry Lord may you help us and bless us
[2:07:33] in the question and answer and the
[2:07:35] oncoming service on the weekend. We
[2:07:37] commit everything unto thy hand. We
[2:07:39] bless your name and thank you for
[2:07:41] everything in the name of Jesus Christ.
