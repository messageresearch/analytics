[28:06] way here there was a cop that actually
[28:08] pulled my dad over because he was
[28:11] slightly speeding
[28:12] so
[28:17] so when he pulled him over he was
[28:19] looking at him and my dad was like we're
[28:21] going to church and stuff I had my music
[28:23] on we're going to church and he was just
[28:25] looking my dad was like can you promise
[28:27] me you're not gonna speed
[28:30] so he didn't give us a ticket he just
[28:32] let us off so I want to thank God for
[28:34] that
[28:40] and
[28:42] and my other praise report is when I was
[28:45] at work like usually I have my camera
[28:46] torso and I like to always double check
[28:50] whenever I'm getting out of car before I
[28:52] do anything
[28:53] so I got out the car I'm pretty sure I
[28:56] had my key when it was time to go home I
[28:59] was with my friend and after that I
[29:00] looked I didn't have my key with me so
[29:03] the first thing that came to mind I told
[29:04] I was like God please let it not be
[29:06] inside so I want her to go back
[29:08] one my friend looked shocked the other
[29:09] one was laughing and a lot of thoughts
[29:12] start running to my mind I was like my
[29:14] dad would be mad if I have to call him
[29:15] because I don't have the key and stuff
[29:17] like that and I started reviewing my day
[29:20] like where must I have been that I don't
[29:23] know where my body just started walking
[29:24] towards the car and after automatically
[29:26] I opened the door after I saw the kid
[29:27] was in there so I thank God because I
[29:30] found my key
[29:37] as for the praise report there's a
[29:40] sister that I work with Miss kadian and

[48:38] glory to God
[48:46] second Chronicle chapter seven
[48:49] verse 14.
[48:52] amen
[48:55] you there
[48:57] the Bible says if my people
[49:01] we know who is the people of God now
[49:04] because we were not his people but there
[49:07] is a promise that he spoke that we will
[49:09] be called his people because the Jews
[49:12] rejected him now we become not only the
[49:15] People by the blood of God Amen If my
[49:19] people which are called by my name
[49:23] shall humble themselves amen
[49:26] and do water
[49:28] and pray and seek my face
[49:32] so in prayer you are seeking the face
[49:35] you might be seated
[49:37] if we humble ourselves
[49:40] amen
[49:42] if we humble ourselves and pray Amen in
[49:47] the prayer we are seeking for somebody
[49:51] you are not seeking for me in prayer
[49:54] you're not seeking for a prophet we are
[49:57] seeking for the face
[50:00] amen the face of God
[50:03] amen and seek my face what are you going
[50:07] to do with the face of God
[50:10] amen
[50:12] and seek my face
[50:14] and turn from their Wicked Ways
[50:17] then will I hear from where Heaven you
[50:20] remember that right we are aware on the
[50:23] earth and we're trying to communicate
[50:25] with Heaven amen so somebody is on Earth
[50:28] you remember this is pretty good
[50:30] amen you're trying to make a contact
[50:33] with somebody who is in heaven
[50:36] and the one who is in heaven is our
[50:38] father
[50:39] you remember that right
[50:41] Our Father amen
[50:44] I will hear from heaven
[50:46] and out and will forgive their sin and
[50:50] will heal their land
[50:53] so somebody have done something wrong
[50:56] and is in trouble
[50:58] so they are seeking God to intervene
[51:01] so they reach out to God through prayer
[51:04] and God will answer
[51:06] answering by fulfilling their desire
[51:09] amen
[51:10] praise God verse 15 now manize shall be
[51:15] open and man ear attend unto the prayer
[51:18] that is made in this place
[51:21] amen amen that place you know where it
[51:25] is
[51:27] amen
[51:28] let me call this church this place amen
[51:34] it depends on what you're looking at
[51:36] let's go to First Timothy chapter two
[51:38] that was the Temple of Solomon
[51:46] this church doesn't belong to a man he
[51:48] belongs to God
[51:51] ah man
[51:55] amen
[51:57] First Timothy chapter 2 verse 8 if you
[52:00] dare you can say Amen
[52:02] glory to God
[52:04] I will therefore that man
[52:08] pray away everywhere you understand this
[52:11] right
[52:12] now you can pray everywhere they didn't
[52:14] hear they say pray only in church all
[52:17] pray at home I'm sorry all pray in the
[52:20] closet
[52:21] those are places but you can pray
[52:23] everywhere
[52:25] even when you're fishing you can pray
[52:28] when you're driving you can pray
[52:30] I wish that man prays everywhere
[52:33] lifting up holy hands
[52:36] with a rough and water doubting
[52:41] prayer
[52:44] cannot be coupled with rough
[52:48] if you're angry we talk about it stay
[52:50] away
[52:51] and you cannot be in prayer with what
[52:54] without doubting
[52:59] the opposite of doubting is what
[53:01] believing which is faith
[53:06] you remember Sunday right
[53:11] glory to God
[53:14] so we must go in prayer how with faith
[53:19] if not you're wasting your time
[53:22] everybody okay
[53:24] last one James chapter 5.
[53:28] and then we start
[53:31] James 5 verse 14 Hallelujah
[53:36] you there
[53:39] is any sick among you
[53:42] let him call the Elders of the church
[53:47] and let them pray over him
[53:50] anointing him with oil in the name of
[53:54] the Lord that's a symbol amen
[53:56] and the prayer of water the faith so
[54:00] when you pray for somebody you don't
[54:02] pray as a formality sir
[54:06] you must pray the prayer of faith
[54:10] amen you must believe what you're trying
[54:13] to do
[54:15] anyway we will get to that amen the
[54:18] prayer of faith it's rather pray and
[54:21] faith
[54:22] shall save the sick
[54:24] and the Lord shall raise him up
[54:28] so we pray and God is doing the work
[54:33] amen amen and if he has committed sins
[54:36] they shall be have forgiven him
[54:39] all of this by prayer
[54:42] you can reach everything amen
[54:45] verse 16 confess your fault one to
[54:49] another
[54:50] and pray one for another that he may be
[54:54] how healed we want to see healing what
[54:56] do we need to do pray is it complicated
[55:01] the effectual fervent prayer
[55:10] affection
[55:13] then fervent
[55:18] amen prayer
[55:21] not just pray
[55:24] fervent prayer what does he mean
[55:26] an affection of fervent prayer of a
[55:30] righteous man a valid match
[55:35] when they say righteous man
[55:37] usually we have a tendency to see that
[55:39] ah a man who's perfect nothing wrong
[55:42] with it look at the next verse now God
[55:44] balances you back because if you
[55:47] continue with your righteousness you
[55:49] will begin to think that the only way
[55:51] you can pray and your prayer being so
[55:53] you must be
[55:55] perfect a certain way now God is
[55:58] correcting or balancing that in verse 17
[56:01] he say Elias which is Elijah was a man
[56:05] subject to like passions as we are he
[56:09] was a human being
[56:10] and he pray how earnestly
[56:15] not just pray earnestly
[56:25] amen amen pray endlessly amen
[56:30] that it might not Reign and it ran not
[56:34] so in other words his prayer worked
[56:37] on the Earth by a space of three years
[56:40] and how many months six months
[56:43] and he Pray Again
[56:46] he looks like Elias in the old what he
[56:48] was doing
[56:49] he know how to lock and unlock something
[56:53] amen but he was just like me and you
[56:57] [Music]
[56:58] what was going on with Elijah amen
[57:02] and he prayed again
[57:04] and the heaven gave rain
[57:06] and the Earth brought forth her fruit so
[57:10] if Elijah is there
[57:13] the weather people will be in trouble
[57:18] they can predict whatever they want if
[57:21] Elijah pray your way they changed
[57:26] everybody okay amen all that Elijah uses
[57:29] prayer amen
[57:32] you want to change the heaven
[57:34] prayer
[57:36] you want to lock the Heaven prayer you
[57:38] want to open the Heaven prayer
[57:42] is it complicated
[57:44] let's pray again Heavenly Father Lord we
[57:47] are approaching you again humbly tonight
[57:49] father we thank you for your grace you
[57:51] love your mercy and forgiving us even
[57:54] the ability to be able to touch the Holy

[58:02] Holy Spirit father I have done what I
[58:05] can do as a human being now may you come
[58:08] and speak and teach us again hard to
[58:11] pray Lord father we humbly commit
[58:14] everything unto that hand be the
[58:16] beginning and the end in the name of
[58:18] Jesus Christ amen

[58:25] prayer amen

[58:38] this Earth here waiting for our
[58:39] Redemption to go to heaven
[58:42] and for some reason we don't see God as
[58:45] a human being
[58:46] amen unless the Lord open your eyes so
[58:49] you can see him but we know that God is
[58:52] there amen and in order to communicate
[58:55] with God or in order to leave this earth

[1:02:20] we come to the most humbly father in the
[1:02:23] name of the Lord Jesus to ask first
[1:02:27] I will deal with this down the road to
[1:02:30] forgive us of our sins and errors there
[1:02:33] is a reason why this need to be first
[1:02:37] but I won't touch it today because in
[1:02:39] the prayer of Jesus Christ it's down

[1:02:44] bottom to the top
[1:02:46] everybody okay
[1:02:48] he says and we are so happy to know that
[1:02:51] we have a high priest setting in glory

[1:03:49] brother Branham say he hears
[1:03:52] the prayer of everyone that shall come
[1:03:55] humbly asking

[1:04:11] asking to be plugged into
[1:04:14] eternity
[1:04:15] [Applause]
[1:04:17] so prayer is a telephone
[1:04:20] it's a telephone that you used to call
[1:04:23] the central class Jesus which is our
[1:04:26] father because on Sunday me and my
[1:04:28] father we are so we call our father and

[1:04:40] will answer how do you call him you call
[1:04:43] him by prayer everybody okay
[1:04:46] prayer is very important
[1:04:50] before you make any decision
[1:04:57] fun decision my brother glory to God
[1:05:01] amen
[1:05:03] you bear with me if I stay to put this
[1:05:06] on uh on a slide it would take me
[1:05:09] forever amen
[1:05:12] let me say a way of communication before
[1:05:15] making decision in the message the
[1:05:18] prophet Elisha brother Branham says this
[1:05:20] in paragraph 10 he say sometime we go
[1:05:24] off on a tantrum somewhere
[1:05:27] and not think about God
[1:05:29] not pray over it ask the Lord whether we
[1:05:33] should do it or not
[1:05:35] and find out that our supplier of
[1:05:38] blessing is cut off in other words we
[1:05:41] wake up when something is blocked
[1:05:44] we rush into doing something without
[1:05:47] praying when it's blocked that's when we
[1:05:49] remember did we ask God whether we need
[1:05:52] to do this or not brother Branham say
[1:05:55] then we wonder sometime well wonder why
[1:05:58] I can't have no more blessings
[1:06:00] you don't watch
[1:06:02] you let down in your prayer life
[1:06:07] you say well I'm a Christian well that's
[1:06:11] the more sun you should pray more than
[1:06:14] ever
[1:06:15] read the Bible every day pray every day
[1:06:20] you cannot have one day pass without you
[1:06:23] praying
[1:06:24] [Applause]
[1:06:26] a Christian prays every day
[1:06:29] and he prays everywhere
[1:06:31] [Applause]
[1:06:33] you can never pray too much brother
[1:06:36] Branham said we can talk too much we can
[1:06:38] sing too much we can do everything too
[1:06:40] much but never pray
[1:06:42] brother Branham continue he say don't
[1:06:45] make any decision too harshly
[1:06:48] all too quickly with our first
[1:06:51] considering God a body
[1:06:54] ask him
[1:06:56] shall I do this father
[1:06:58] ask him is it your will for me to do
[1:07:01] this
[1:07:02] then see what the holy spirit will speak
[1:07:05] to you he might not give you a vision
[1:07:08] but he will speak in some way to you
[1:07:12] you remember in question and answer
[1:07:14] somebody asked a question how do we know
[1:07:17] that God how God speak and I answer that
[1:07:19] question if you were not there you ask
[1:07:21] those that were there amen he said then
[1:07:25] see what the holy spirit will speak to
[1:07:27] you he might not give you a vision but
[1:07:29] he will speak in some way to you to let
[1:07:32] you know if you shall be sincere and ask
[1:07:35] him
[1:07:37] so prayer is your telephone
[1:07:39] do not move without calling Jesus
[1:07:44] and ask him what do you what am I
[1:07:46] supposed to do should I do this or not
[1:07:49] the problem is you don't even believe
[1:07:51] that God will answer
[1:07:56] if we praying just because we were
[1:07:59] taught to pray
[1:08:02] in other words what we do is I want to
[1:08:05] go somewhere we send her or sit down and
[1:08:08] pray Lord Jesus Christ I want to know
[1:08:10] your will but there is no will you are
[1:08:12] waiting you already know your will your
[1:08:14] wave you want to go
[1:08:22] to me not to you you are stupid
[1:08:26] everybody okay that's the way we do Lord
[1:08:28] Jesus Christ I'm trying to travel this
[1:08:30] way
[1:08:31] and when we finish we say I prayed about
[1:08:33] it we buy the ticket and we go
[1:08:37] amen because you're doing what you want
[1:08:40] to do
[1:08:41] when you went to prayer you didn't even
[1:08:43] believe somebody would tell you yes or
[1:08:46] no
[1:08:47] you already have your plan you are
[1:08:49] praying just because you were told to do
[1:08:52] so so you can cover your conscience
[1:08:55] that when I'm going in this place when
[1:08:58] I'm eating when I'm doing whatever I
[1:09:00] want to do when I'm engaging into this I
[1:09:03] already prayed about it
[1:09:06] okay you prayed about it what did God
[1:09:08] say about it
[1:09:11] everybody okay because because prayer is
[1:09:13] a communion
[1:09:14] you need to hear from somebody back and
[1:09:16] forth everybody okay so you don't make a
[1:09:19] decision without
[1:09:21] prayer
[1:09:24] let me read something about brother
[1:09:25] Brown I'm here bear with me as I'm going
[1:09:29] slowly
[1:09:30] glory to God
[1:09:32] brother Caleb he says God always answers
[1:09:35] prayers
[1:09:36] in the message here ye him brother
[1:09:38] Branham say we are not on that subject
[1:09:41] we are just backgrounding a little
[1:09:44] get the fear away don't be scared that
[1:09:47] God is not going to answer prayer
[1:09:51] God always
[1:09:56] answer his prayer
[1:10:05] God always sends us prayers
[1:10:08] and we explain in question and answer
[1:10:10] that's the problem is we don't know how
[1:10:13] God speak back and already answered that
[1:10:16] amen but God answer a prayer always
[1:10:21] brother Branham say that their work is
[1:10:24] already finished
[1:10:26] he is obligated he must do it he's got
[1:10:30] to do it to keep his word notice it is a
[1:10:34] finished way so every prayer must have
[1:10:37] an answer amen
[1:10:40] amen
[1:10:41] amen
[1:10:43] you reach a point where your faith need
[1:10:45] to be alive
[1:10:47] or if you don't have faith you need to
[1:10:50] seek the Holy Ghost
[1:10:52] because we can't fool the devil anymore
[1:10:56] we're not doing religion
[1:10:59] religion is things that you do in in uh
[1:11:04] in as a routine but there is no life
[1:11:09] you can talk about the angel but you
[1:11:11] don't even believe yourself that there
[1:11:13] is an angel
[1:11:14] you don't even believe that one day you
[1:11:16] will see one that's religion
[1:11:20] this church is not religion no sir
[1:11:23] whatever we preach here we must partake
[1:11:26] it
[1:11:27] [Applause]
[1:11:28] we must experience what we are preaching
[1:11:31] amen because Jesus Christ is the same
[1:11:34] yesterday today and water forever
[1:11:38] my God is not dead also
[1:11:42] my God is alive
[1:11:44] [Applause]
[1:11:49] let's go to Hebrew 11.
[1:11:53] glory to God
[1:11:57] Hallelujah
[1:12:00] message believer the law of religion
[1:12:06] yeah the law of religion that's why they
[1:12:09] get off the message they begin to take
[1:12:11] what they thought was religion
[1:12:14] because that's what they thought that
[1:12:17] being in a message meaning below wear
[1:12:19] long dresses do this do that's part of
[1:12:22] the message but the message is more than
[1:12:24] that
[1:12:25] you are wearing that as a result of a
[1:12:28] life that is in you
[1:12:31] if you don't have that life you quit
[1:12:33] this message that's why you're wearing
[1:12:35] your your dresses are changing because
[1:12:39] you were doing that for religion
[1:12:44] let's go to Hebrew chapter 11. now we
[1:12:47] start climbing
[1:12:49] glory to God if you dare you can say
[1:12:51] Amen
[1:12:52] you understand this very well right
[1:12:57] let's go to verse six very simple let's
[1:13:00] go but without water faith it is how
[1:13:04] impossible to do whatever please God
[1:13:09] with that faith it is how impossible
[1:13:13] what does impossible means
[1:13:20] it cannot happen
[1:13:23] now my question is if you don't have
[1:13:26] faith
[1:13:27] what can you get from God
[1:13:33] I'm reading the scripture am I reading a
[1:13:36] different Bible
[1:13:37] the Bible said we got faith it's what
[1:13:39] impossible there is no way around
[1:13:46] if there is no faith
[1:13:48] amen it is impossible to please God so
[1:13:52] when you are approaching God
[1:13:57] in prayer
[1:13:59] doubting
[1:14:01] you are displeasing him
[1:14:07] it is better for you to go to sleep
[1:14:11] [Applause]
[1:14:20] oh my God impossible
[1:14:22] [Music]
[1:14:25] in other words not possible
[1:14:28] there is no possibility for you to
[1:14:31] please God
[1:14:32] everybody okay
[1:14:34] he said with that faith it is impossible
[1:14:38] to please him follow me carefully
[1:14:42] amen because we remember prayer brother
[1:14:45] Branham say it doesn't mean to bring God
[1:14:47] down
[1:14:48] you remember that it means taking men to
[1:14:51] the presence of God you remember that
[1:14:53] but when you go into his presence you
[1:14:55] must go a certain way
[1:14:57] you don't just go there
[1:14:59] if you don't have faith you might as
[1:15:01] well go back
[1:15:03] because you won't please him you ready
[1:15:05] verse
[1:15:07] 6 with our faith it is impossible to
[1:15:11] please him for he that cometh to God
[1:15:16] why are you coming to God
[1:15:20] you need something from God and the
[1:15:23] vehicle remember that take us to God is
[1:15:26] prayer
[1:15:27] the vehicle that take us here unto the
[1:15:30] present remember job was praying that if
[1:15:32] I can find his place if I can talk to
[1:15:35] him you remember so the vehicle that
[1:15:37] take you from here to there is prayer so
[1:15:39] the Bible say with that faith it is
[1:15:42] impossible for you to please God we okay
[1:15:45] now and the Bible says that when you are
[1:15:49] coming before God
[1:15:51] amen God want to see two things
[1:15:56] are you ready
[1:15:57] the Bible said he that cometh to God
[1:16:00] must believe that he's
[1:16:04] so before you start praying
[1:16:09] you must believe that God exists
[1:16:16] you cannot believe this Bible as a
[1:16:19] stories
[1:16:25] everybody okay
[1:16:27] we we do things unconsciously
[1:16:30] when we pray we're praying like we're
[1:16:32] praying to somebody in the air
[1:16:36] that's what your conscience has
[1:16:38] amen that's the problem we have
[1:16:42] amen you are praying Lord Jesus but you
[1:16:45] know that this Lord Jesus is somebody
[1:16:47] that is somewhere and they told us he
[1:16:50] looks like this picture
[1:16:54] but God said when you approach him
[1:16:56] number one you must believe that he is
[1:17:00] we okay
[1:17:02] follow me you must believe that he is a
[1:17:05] man and that he is a water rewarder of
[1:17:09] those that do water diligently seek him
[1:17:13] so before you come to God you must carry
[1:17:17] Faith amen
[1:17:20] you must believe that I am going to see
[1:17:24] a being
[1:17:25] that is real
[1:17:27] because when you call he will answer it
[1:17:30] for you to believe that he can answer
[1:17:32] you must believe that he existed
[1:17:37] he is not a dead God
[1:17:40] he's a God that can talk
[1:17:43] he can he say God that can touch you
[1:17:46] [Applause]
[1:17:49] he said God that can appear to you
[1:17:53] so when you go into prayer you must
[1:17:56] expect anything from God
[1:17:58] [Applause]
[1:18:02] do you know what we do when we stop
[1:18:04] praying
[1:18:06] you pray you pray if you hear something
[1:18:08] moving what do you do
[1:18:12] you see
[1:18:14] you see because you don't expect
[1:18:16] anything to move
[1:18:18] you want to do your duty and come out
[1:18:20] but when you're praying just know that
[1:18:23] you are approaching a being
[1:18:25] and that being can react and I'm gonna
[1:18:27] show you soon
[1:18:29] everybody okay everybody okay everybody
[1:18:31] okay so before you go to prayer cool
[1:18:35] down a little bit
[1:18:38] don't just wake up and say I'm going to
[1:18:39] pray because you don't even know what
[1:18:41] you're doing before you pray slow down
[1:18:45] put your mind down a little bit and
[1:18:48] begin to think about him
[1:18:49] [Applause]
[1:18:52] [Music]
[1:18:54] everybody okay the same way brother
[1:18:58] Benjamin is approaching his father
[1:19:01] brother Mickey
[1:19:03] he's not approaching in the a being that
[1:19:06] they just told him he knows that his
[1:19:08] father is there and he knows that when
[1:19:11] he speak brother meet you will answer
[1:19:12] that's the way you answer that's the way
[1:19:15] you approach God
[1:19:17] [Applause]
[1:19:19] everybody okay everybody good so when
[1:19:22] you are approaching God you must first
[1:19:25] believe that the one I'm approaching is
[1:19:28] not a myth
[1:19:30] foreign
[1:19:31] cartoons
[1:19:36] it is not somebody that I read on
[1:19:39] Jehovah Witnesses stuff
[1:19:42] it is somebody that is real
[1:19:45] he's a human being he can talk
[1:19:49] he can write
[1:19:50] [Applause]
[1:19:52] [Music]
[1:19:53] and that person is also a rewarder
[1:20:00] of of the person who diligently seek him
[1:20:05] diligence he means you're gonna find a
[1:20:08] position
[1:20:09] [Music]
[1:20:17] Lord help me
[1:20:19] let me read this I don't have it there
[1:20:22] but a Caleb I have it I took a
[1:20:25] screenshot of it
[1:20:27] Lord help me if I can find it amen
[1:20:30] listen to brother Branham Hallelujah
[1:20:33] brother Branham said in the message
[1:20:35] perseverance you can put it down 63 11
[1:20:38] 16 in the evening paragraph 67. he said
[1:20:43] persevering now we know the word I think
[1:20:47] that it means to be persistent
[1:20:49] and persistent in something that you are
[1:20:52] doing in making a goal or something you
[1:20:56] have to be persistent
[1:20:57] and man through all ages
[1:21:00] that had faith
[1:21:02] in what they are trying to achieve
[1:21:05] had to be persistent
[1:21:09] especially if you're trying to do
[1:21:11] something right
[1:21:14] because you are going to meet an
[1:21:18] opposition
[1:21:19] when you trying to pray you will see the
[1:21:23] devil begin to throw things at you
[1:21:29] I don't know if you listen to me you can
[1:21:32] sit down and watch TV nothing happens
[1:21:35] you can talk on the phone nothing
[1:21:37] happened as soon as you decide that it's
[1:21:41] time to go to prayer suddenly the babies
[1:21:45] crying suddenly the telephone is ringing
[1:21:49] suddenly a DOT comes you need to do your
[1:21:52] dishes you forget the laundry thing
[1:21:55] because somebody knows what you're going
[1:21:57] to do
[1:21:58] [Applause]
[1:22:02] so to pray he's a fighter
[1:22:06] yes sir
[1:22:09] dress up everybody okay because you're
[1:22:12] trying to make connection with heaven
[1:22:14] [Applause]
[1:22:18] you can call the children you say time
[1:22:20] to pray this one is going to brush his
[1:22:22] teeth 20 minutes this one goes and do so
[1:22:24] and you just wonder what is going on
[1:22:27] because the devil doesn't like it you
[1:22:29] mentioned the word prayer because prayer
[1:22:32] if you remember that's where we send
[1:22:34] atomic bomb
[1:22:37] that's where we send our missiles
[1:22:39] that's where we destroy everything that
[1:22:43] was infiltrating into the house
[1:22:45] [Applause]
[1:22:48] that's where we begin to renew our
[1:22:51] connection back
[1:22:52] that's why we need to we we are
[1:22:55] detaching from the earth and begin to
[1:22:58] get into the supernatural everybody that
[1:23:01] have been a man of Faith must be
[1:23:03] persistent
[1:23:05] and when you are approaching God you
[1:23:07] must believe that first is
[1:23:13] not he is a God
[1:23:15] but he is a living being and he is a
[1:23:19] rewarder
[1:23:20] in other words he will reward you
[1:23:24] he will give you back what you want
[1:23:29] and he is a rewarder of those that
[1:23:32] diligently water
[1:23:33] so when you seek God you must have a
[1:23:36] reward
[1:23:38] that's why brother Branham say God
[1:23:41] always answers prayer
[1:23:43] [Applause]
[1:23:44] [Music]
[1:23:47] because when you go through prayer
[1:23:49] somebody have an answer
[1:23:52] somebody will reward you at the end and
[1:23:55] you can never approach god with a doubt
[1:23:57] that's why Paul said you can never pray
[1:24:00] doubting
[1:24:01] you must approach him by faith believing
[1:24:04] that he is
[1:24:06] and whatever I'm about to speak to him
[1:24:10] he is the one that can give me the
[1:24:12] solution amen that's why I'm approaching
[1:24:15] him
[1:24:15] if you don't believe that don't even
[1:24:17] pray
[1:24:21] everybody okay if you believe the bank
[1:24:24] will give you the solution just go to
[1:24:26] the bank
[1:24:26] [Music]

[1:25:13] if you dare you can say Amen
[1:25:15] if any of you lack wisdom
[1:25:19] let him do what ask of God so if
[1:25:23] somebody doesn't have wisdom it is your
[1:25:26] own fault
[1:25:29] if you lack wisdom it is not your parent
[1:25:32] you need to ask God
[1:25:34] he gave it to Shadrach Meshach Abednego
[1:25:37] and Daniel
[1:25:40] so don't search for a family member who
[1:25:42] was dumb in school no
[1:25:47] everybody okay leave the family member
[1:25:49] alone everybody okay he said if any of
[1:25:53] you like wisdom let him do what ask God
[1:25:56] that giveth to some men no
[1:26:03] how liberally
[1:26:05] [Music]
[1:26:07] God gives how liberally liberally and
[1:26:11] not breaded water not
[1:26:13] and it shall be water given him because
[1:26:16] God always ensures prayers amen
[1:26:20] and he will give it to you freely
[1:26:23] in other word god
[1:26:25] have so much that he want to give away
[1:26:30] [Applause]
[1:26:33] the Earth belongs to him
[1:26:38] let me continue amen
[1:26:40] verse 6 but let him ask her in faith
[1:26:44] everybody good
[1:26:46] I know where what I'm drilling everybody
[1:26:48] okay
[1:26:49] so you don't just ask like that you must
[1:26:53] ask her in faith
[1:26:55] because with our faith it is impossible

[1:27:01] so when you are approaching God make
[1:27:04] sure stop to yourself say Hey listen you
[1:27:08] want to talk to God right just know that
[1:27:12] if you are approaching make sure you you
[1:27:14] know what you're doing
[1:27:15] because you're going to get an answer
[1:27:18] if you're not sure you stay here until
[1:27:21] you're sure if not you want to waste
[1:27:23] your time
[1:27:25] and brag how you pray three hours
[1:27:29] because your problem is the exercise
[1:27:34] I'm gonna show you that
[1:27:35] if I can get to that and then
[1:27:38] James said but let him ask how in faith
[1:27:42] we already preach faith on Sunday comma
[1:27:45] nothing water wavering for he the
[1:27:48] weather is like a wave of the sea driven
[1:27:52] with the wind and the water fast
[1:27:57] are we okay
[1:27:59] jump to verse 7 for let not Damon demand
[1:28:04] that is wavering
[1:28:05] the one the man that is approaching god
[1:28:08] with our faith without believing that
[1:28:10] he's
[1:28:12] and he is the one that's gonna give you
[1:28:14] your solution
[1:28:15] the man let that man think let not the
[1:28:19] man think that he shall receive water
[1:28:22] anything of the Lord
[1:28:30] possible amen

[1:29:58] a rewarder you're going to heaven is not

[1:50:33] but Paul said pray also in the water
[1:50:36] spirit in the spirit it is not you
[1:50:38] praying it is the holy spirit praying
[1:50:42] [Music]
[1:50:43] why do we need the spirit of the Lord to
[1:50:46] pray
[1:50:48] why do we need the spirit of God to pray
[1:50:50] let me read brother Brana
[1:50:53] brother uh Caleb please let's go to uh
[1:51:03] praise be to the name of the Lord let's
[1:51:06] go to atmosphere and in the spirit
[1:51:09] the kingdom of God is the Holy Ghost you
[1:51:12] are welcoming his Spirit you are calling
[1:51:15] on him to come and take over this prayer
[1:51:18] why
[1:51:20] you there
[1:51:21] in the message the Patmos Vision
[1:51:24] preaching UH 60 December 4th brother
[1:51:29] Branham says this he says now
[1:51:33] you can't do any good
[1:51:36] until first you get in the spirit
[1:51:41] God can use you
[1:51:45] all your effort are in vain
[1:51:48] until first you do it in the spirit
[1:51:55] can I continue
[1:51:57] if I will sing I will sing in the spirit
[1:52:00] this is
[1:52:02] if I shall pray say Paul I shall pray in
[1:52:07] the spirit
[1:52:09] I'm reading brother Brown they're going
[1:52:11] to put it in now it's atmosphere and in
[1:52:13] the spirit
[1:52:14] and then if there is anything that comes
[1:52:18] to me that is any good it has to be
[1:52:21] revealed to me by the spirit and
[1:52:24] confirmed by the word made manifest by
[1:52:27] the result he bears
[1:52:30] why do we want the spirit to get there
[1:52:32] brother Branham is explaining us
[1:52:35] in the message the exposition of the
[1:52:37] church brother Branham says this
[1:52:40] mine I love that he was talking about
[1:52:43] John being I was in the spirit in the
[1:52:46] Lord's day you remember that in the Book
[1:52:48] of Revelation 1 10 I was in the spirit
[1:52:51] in the Lord's day brother is explaining
[1:52:53] that he said my
[1:52:55] I love that you could just call those
[1:52:58] words the whole of a Christian Life this
[1:53:02] word I'm saying we can call this the
[1:53:04] whole of a Christian Life
[1:53:06] if we are going to live as a Christian
[1:53:10] we have to be in his spirit
[1:53:14] John was not talking about being in his
[1:53:17] own spirit
[1:53:18] that's your own understanding that would
[1:53:20] not have brought this vision
[1:53:22] he had to be the spirit of God
[1:53:26] so brother Branham is saying here when
[1:53:28] you break into the automatic the spirit
[1:53:31] realm this is where the supernatural
[1:53:34] opener
[1:53:37] this is where you can see a vision
[1:53:40] this is where you can hear God talking
[1:53:44] this is where you are aware that you are
[1:53:49] not alone in the room
[1:53:51] like another being have just came in
[1:53:56] he changes your prayer because you're
[1:53:59] using a different deal
[1:54:03] have I lost anyone
[1:54:06] brother Branham say John was not talking
[1:54:09] about being in his own spirit
[1:54:12] that would not have brought this Vision
[1:54:14] he had to be the spirit of God he has to
[1:54:17] be the spirit of God with us too or all
[1:54:21] our efforts are in vain
[1:54:23] Paul say I will pray in the spirit I
[1:54:27] will sing in the spirit I will live in
[1:54:30] the spirit if there is anything good
[1:54:32] that will come to me he has to be
[1:54:34] revealed by the spirit confirmed by the
[1:54:37] word and made manifest by this by the
[1:54:40] result he Bears what does he mean
[1:54:42] praying in the spirit
[1:54:45] in the message is there anything too
[1:54:48] hard for the Lord paragraph 10 brother
[1:54:51] Branham say then I climb up a little
[1:54:53] father into the thicket
[1:54:56] and I knelt down and the mosquitoes were
[1:54:59] just Hamming all around my ear
[1:55:02] you know when you're trying to pray I
[1:55:05] just addressed I already addressed that
[1:55:06] and I couldn't hardly pray
[1:55:10] and I believe then it was the devil
[1:55:16] he must shock you but I'm gonna say it
[1:55:19] the devil can use your normal family
[1:55:23] routine
[1:55:24] to block you from praying
[1:55:30] [Applause]
[1:55:32] everybody okay brother Branham children
[1:55:35] sometimes were getting upset and begin
[1:55:38] to argue one another and brother Branham
[1:55:41] saying was the devil doing that just to
[1:55:43] upset brother Branham because he knows
[1:55:46] if brother Branham get consecrated he's
[1:55:47] gonna get something
[1:55:49] so you need to learn this you need to
[1:55:52] have discernment
[1:55:53] to see what is normal and what is not
[1:55:55] normal brother Branham had a child that
[1:55:58] was praying all the time I mean crying
[1:56:01] all the time
[1:56:02] turn around the baby cry cry cry cry
[1:56:05] and brother Branham thought he was
[1:56:07] normal until one day the Holy Spirit say
[1:56:10] hey
[1:56:11] wake up it's the devil traveling your
[1:56:14] ministry
[1:56:15] it was Sarah
[1:56:16] brother I'm calling his wife he said
[1:56:18] bring the baby here
[1:56:19] he rebuked the spirit brother random say
[1:56:22] Sarah become the meekest of all his
[1:56:25] children
[1:56:27] so what you think
[1:56:29] what you think is normal sometimes it's
[1:56:32] not normal
[1:56:34] why all this question when I'm about to
[1:56:37] pray why you didn't tell me your problem
[1:56:39] only when I'm about to pray
[1:56:42] why are you bringing them now daddy look
[1:56:45] at this daddy look at this daddy look at
[1:56:47] this uh you know what is going on wait a
[1:56:48] minute let me pray first then I'll come
[1:56:50] back

[1:56:54] before you know it it's time to go to
[1:56:56] bed you gotta work tomorrow
[1:56:59] you know what I'm saying don't say Amen

[2:05:07] things happen the disciples look at
[2:05:09] Jesus they say your way of praying he
[2:05:12] said teach us how to pray

[2:05:34] they might be sharp in politics
[2:05:38] you open politics you're gonna hear them
[2:05:41] they know everything
[2:05:45] whoever does it let's go my friend so
[2:05:48] likewise the spirit also the water help
[2:05:51] with our infirmities for we know nothing
[2:05:56] that's good it's a freedom Mama we know
[2:05:59] what what we should pray for actually
[2:06:02] the Lord the Lord that to remind me of
[2:06:04] scripture I'm going to give it to you he
[2:06:06] said for we know not what we should
[2:06:08] water pray for as we are
[2:06:12] reach brother we okay
[2:06:14] but the water spirit itself with water
[2:06:17] making intercessions for us
[2:06:21] which cannot be water and he's the
[2:06:25] daughter searches the hearts knoweth
[2:06:27] what is in the mind of the water the
[2:06:29] spirit because he make intercession for
[2:06:32] who the Saints according to water the
[2:06:35] will of God
[2:06:36] [Applause]
[2:06:37] [Music]
[2:06:42] the Holy Spirit man of God spoke by the
[2:06:47] Holy Ghost amen
[2:06:49] the one who spoke the Bible is the holy
[2:06:52] spirit he knows what he done
[2:06:56] he knows what how how he put his word
[2:07:01] so when you are calling on him that
[2:07:03] Kingdom Come when he cometh he picks you
[2:07:07] up and begin to help you up
[2:07:11] suddenly you pray and you begin to feel
[2:07:13] like scripture are coming brother brand
[2:07:15] I'm saying that
[2:07:17] somebody's pulling scripture if you're a
[2:07:19] preacher it tells you go get your book
[2:07:22] uh I'm in pen quickly get your message
[2:07:24] quickly
[2:07:26] why because you already broke into the
[2:07:28] supernatural
[2:07:30] if it's something you are asking he's
[2:07:32] giving you a scripture remember I am the
[2:07:34] Lord who did this who did this who did
[2:07:36] this
[2:07:37] because where the spirit of the Lord is
[2:07:40] there is
[2:07:45] the spirit of the Lord how
[2:07:49] because the spirit knows the will of God
[2:07:53] why is it important that the spirit stay
[2:07:56] with the will of God
[2:07:58] do you know why
[2:08:00] I'm going to stop here let's go to first
[2:08:02] John 5.
[2:08:07] I believe that is it
[2:08:10] I wrote so many things that I would get
[2:08:12] into it okay I love it amazing
[2:08:16] let's go to First John chapter 5.
[2:08:20] so it's a teaching in prayer
[2:08:23] first John chapter 5 if you dare you can
[2:08:25] say amen amen go to verse 15 my friend
[2:08:30] amen
[2:08:34] if by any chance you found those quotes
[2:08:37] you can just put it up so whoever you
[2:08:39] want to get them
[2:08:40] can get them later
[2:08:42] if not I will get an email or
[2:08:45] somebody is asking for it
[2:08:49] maybe he or any national so
[2:08:52] amen I know what I'm talking about
[2:08:55] amen you there
[2:08:58] you there
[2:08:59] John 2 verse 14. read it my friend
[2:09:03] and this is the water confidence that we
[2:09:06] have where in him if we ask him what
[2:09:09] anything
[2:09:11] did he block something did he tell us
[2:09:14] what not to ask there you ask what
[2:09:16] anything
[2:09:19] you ask water
[2:09:21] even these glasses you can ask him for
[2:09:26] you can ask him for this guitar
[2:09:30] anything
[2:09:31] you can ask him for the puppet
[2:09:34] if I tell you the story of this puppet
[2:09:36] it's a miracle
[2:09:38] everybody okay if we ask for anything
[2:09:41] amen you there
[2:09:44] according to what his will so you must
[2:09:48] ask how according to his will but when
[2:09:51] the Holy Spirit Come he help you how
[2:09:56] according to the water will of God
[2:09:58] because the spirit is God he is the one
[2:10:01] that wrote the Bible amen he will never
[2:10:04] deviate from the will of God in other
[2:10:07] words why you are missing on your
[2:10:09] imperfection or prayer the Holy Spirit
[2:10:12] can redirect you and say God this way
[2:10:15] lock God here
[2:10:22] everybody okay do you remember the woman
[2:10:25] we finish your blood no scripture the
[2:10:28] Holy Spirit told her go ahead and touch
[2:10:30] over there
[2:10:31] and if you notice in the scripture later
[2:10:33] on people begin to do that it's written
[2:10:35] in the Bible
[2:10:37] they begin to do the same thing like the
[2:10:39] woman of the issue of blood and they
[2:10:41] begin to get here
[2:10:43] send me a text I'll send you this
[2:10:45] picture
[2:10:46] everybody okay why because somebody
[2:10:48] started
[2:10:49] and when God uh I mean answer one person
[2:10:52] it's a that's it it becomes his word
[2:10:55] amen
[2:10:56] if if God does something to you
[2:10:59] the word of God is not limited to this
[2:11:04] because there are many things that Jesus
[2:11:06] have done that was not
[2:11:09] so if God does something for you I can
[2:11:12] come back and use you and begin to claim
[2:11:15] it to God
[2:11:17] [Applause]
[2:11:19] this is Abraham you are my Abraham today
[2:11:25] the Abraham was just like brothers
[2:11:28] Charles the Abraham were reading in the
[2:11:30] Bible
[2:11:31] it is God in his human being
[2:11:34] Jesus Christ
[2:11:36] [Music]
[2:11:37] let's go he said according to his will
[2:11:40] he hear us
[2:11:41] verse 15 and if we know that he hear us
[2:11:46] whatsoever
[2:11:48] we ask we know that we have what the
[2:11:51] petition that we do it desire we must
[2:11:54] ask according to his will and when the
[2:11:57] spirit come he asked our petition how
[2:12:00] let's go back to Roman 8.
[2:12:04] and I stop here
[2:12:06] I'm trying to nail this
[2:12:10] praying in the spirit Romans 8 again my
[2:12:13] friend
[2:12:14] let's nail this so
[2:12:16] if you go home you go home with this you
[2:12:18] there
[2:12:20] amen
[2:12:21] go back to verse 26 again you can read
[2:12:23] it
[2:12:25] go ahead my friend I have many things to
[2:12:28] say and to judge of you no Romans 8 26
[2:12:33] likewise the spirit also helpeth our
[2:12:36] infirmities for we know not what we
[2:12:39] should pray for us we are this is our
[2:12:43] understanding but the spirit itself
[2:12:45] makeeth what in recession for who us
[2:12:48] with water which cannot be water utter
[2:12:52] so sometimes he can use a tongue you
[2:12:54] don't understand
[2:12:56] everybody okay and he that search of the
[2:12:59] water
[2:12:59] know if what is in the mind of the water
[2:13:02] searches because he makeeth intercession
[2:13:06] for who
[2:13:07] according to the will of who God because
[2:13:11] whatever you ask according to his will
[2:13:14] God must give you because God always
[2:13:18] assures prayer when you pray Our Father
[2:13:22] which are in heaven Hallowed be thy name
[2:13:25] thy kingdom come
[2:13:31] next time thou will be done
[2:13:34] because if I get to that it's another
[2:13:36] hour
[2:13:39] you must welcome the Holy Spirit we
[2:13:42] cannot be afraid of the spirit of God
[2:13:45] the spirit of God is Not spoke it's not
[2:13:48] Halloween
[2:13:51] that's a perversion of it
[2:13:54] it's a holy spirit it's a real God
[2:13:58] amen
[2:13:59] the Inside Man is a supernatural being
[2:14:03] amen you need to get into a real
[2:14:07] relationship with God where God is real
[2:14:14] where you can sit and say somebody was
[2:14:16] talking to me I heard somebody tell me
[2:14:18] something I was wondering about
[2:14:20] something and a thought came and said
[2:14:22] don't worry
[2:14:25] you want to have that
[2:14:28] you don't need anybody to tell you
[2:14:30] anything that's the best friend that
[2:14:32] will stick with you anytime
[2:14:34] when everybody else don't want to talk
[2:14:36] to you that one is always there
[2:14:39] when you're going to trial that's the
[2:14:41] best friend that will come
[2:14:43] sometimes he can use the preacher and
[2:14:45] the preacher says something that you
[2:14:46] know nobody knew except you and God you
[2:14:50] will know that it's him responding back
[2:14:52] to you
[2:14:53] remember we talk about it in question
[2:14:55] and answer sometimes he can use this he
[2:14:58] can use this he can use he can use
[2:15:00] anything to speak to you
[2:15:02] we want to be in the spirit because when
[2:15:04] you are in the spirit that's when God
[2:15:06] become real
[2:15:08] that's when this message is no longer
[2:15:11] Just Books and tape the message become a
[2:15:14] living person
[2:15:18] amen and you're going to begin to have
[2:15:20] experience for yourself and those
[2:15:23] experience will solidify your faith
[2:15:27] that you know for sure that I have
[2:15:30] somebody backing me up I have a rock
[2:15:32] that is following me
[2:15:34] if something happened I can call on him
[2:15:37] if I'm going through difficulty and if I

[2:15:42] going to speak back to me and when he
[2:15:44] speak you don't argue you don't push you

[2:18:13] father we thank you for your grace
[2:18:16] and we thank you for the moving of the
[2:18:18] Holy Spirit
[2:18:19] because now
[2:18:21] the more we dive into this
[2:18:24] we begin to see how important it is
[2:18:27] to have your spirit
[2:18:29] because without your spirit there is
[2:18:32] nothing we can do Lord
[2:18:34] no wonder you say seek ye first the
[2:18:37] kingdom of God
[2:18:39] something that we need to cherish
[2:18:42] something that we love
[2:18:44] something that we welcome
[2:18:46] because you spoke to us that our kingdom
[2:18:48] is not of this world
[2:18:50] it is a different Kingdom you even told
[2:18:53] the disciple that if he was either
[2:18:56] disciple
[2:18:58] and you'd spoke to pilate you say if my
[2:19:00] kingdom was of this world
[2:19:03] my servant would have fight for me you
[2:19:06] know which kingdom you were in and we
[2:19:08] came from that Kingdom that's the
[2:19:11] kingdom we want
[2:19:12] that you say the kingdom of God is
[2:19:14] within you
[2:19:15] father may you help our prayer life
[2:19:19] may you come and remove all hypocrisy
[2:19:23] all saying and pharisaic praying
[2:19:26] may you remove it from us
[2:19:28] father may you help us budget our time
[2:19:31] may you help us discern
[2:19:34] the attack of the enemy against this
[2:19:37] great weapon and the great key that you
[2:19:39] put in the hand of your children so that
[2:19:42] they understand that prayer is very very
[2:19:45] it's a great value
[2:19:47] and we can never neglect it that you
[2:19:49] spoke to us a month ago that he comes
[2:19:52] first and everything else should be
[2:19:54] secondary
[2:19:55] father they are people
[2:19:58] that I work
[2:19:59] and that wanted to be here
[2:20:02] but Lord because of their work schedule
[2:20:04] they could not make it but I pray that
[2:20:08] you helped them
[2:20:09] and open the way so that they can be in
[2:20:11] service in the midweek there are some
[2:20:14] that the devil have overtaken
[2:20:16] Lord that any slight reason
[2:20:20] they can stay home
[2:20:22] because there is a streaming now because
[2:20:25] they can follow later because something
[2:20:27] else was value before your services
[2:20:30] until they lost their zeal of the
[2:20:34] services and this continue to affect
[2:20:36] their life
[2:20:38] and they are fighting humanly speaking
[2:20:41] but I pray as a shepherd that should be
[2:20:44] merciful to them
[2:20:46] that you give them a wake-up call
[2:20:48] so that they understand that it's very
[2:20:51] important to be in the presence of the
[2:20:53] Lord
[2:20:54] to budget our time to organize our life
[2:20:58] so that we make sure that we give you
[2:21:00] the first place because time is running
[2:21:04] very fast and soon whatever we're trying
[2:21:07] to put first will remain in this world
[2:21:09] it will be under the kingdom of the
[2:21:12] Antichrist and in a three and a half
[2:21:14] years everything will be destroyed and
[2:21:17] become ashes and this entire
[2:21:19] civilization whatever we have
[2:21:21] accomplished in this world will be
[2:21:23] destroyed completely and we will be
[2:21:26] looking at a new city with new homes
[2:21:29] that will be coming down from heaven
[2:21:31] that will be the Eternal City that will
[2:21:34] remain forever
[2:21:35] father you are blessing us like you
[2:21:38] spoke to us that you want us to be
[2:21:40] blessed spiritually physically
[2:21:43] materially in every aspect of our life
[2:21:45] as our soul prosper father the
[2:21:48] prospering of the Soul goes with a deep
[2:21:51] prayer life may you help each one of us
[2:21:53] Lord in our prayer life Lord that we
[2:21:56] realize how important it is to give Lord
[2:22:00] father the preeminence to our prayer
[2:22:03] life and to the things of the Kingdom
[2:22:04] bless your children that went a little
[2:22:07] bit beyond Lord Father Tom
[2:22:10] to give us Lord this opportunity to be
[2:22:13] able to deliver this message so that now
[2:22:16] we understand the importance of your
[2:22:18] spirit because we have been on a manual
[2:22:20] control for a long time but father help
[2:22:23] us to understand how to surrender
[2:22:28] how to make way for the spirit
[2:22:31] how to switch quickly
[2:22:34] so that we can have prayer
[2:22:36] that will bring results on Upon Our Life
[2:22:39] upon our families upon our children
[2:22:43] upon our marriages upon our businesses
[2:22:46] upon the church
[2:22:48] upon our health and upon everything
