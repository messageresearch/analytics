Daniel the seals adoption of someone is listening to the message of the hour amen Lord's willing this uh we had our question and answer yesterday it turned into a testimony question and answer but he was the leading of the holy spirit because so many testimonies of what God is doing in this church God has been so good to us and we trust that he will continue and we believe it that he will continue to be exceedingly and abundantly wonderful unto us because his word is in the midst of us amen so the uncoming question and answer will be announced probably we will check next week we're working with the venue by God's grace but you already know that it space out every quarter so every quarter we have question and answers for the next year Lord's willing if the Lord don't come back yet then we

we clear now February 1st 2025 amen this coming Saturday which is December the 21st is the married couple part four like I say I'm not going to give a question and answer session because what we're dealing with I don't want anyone to speak in the midst of a congregation so if you have a question stick it in the box and then we pick it up from there as we're moving on we will continue to answer your question so part four this coming Saturday at 2:00 same venue at the Hilton Hotel where we used to have service before and I already sent an announcement on the church group chat the next couple meeting which is part five will be on March 22nd so you almost have almost toward 4 mon month to prepare and to be there amen so if you're not there that's not me it is between you and the Lord amen Lord's willing again on December the uh 31st which is Tuesday will be our new year service and we will start at 8:00 p.m. from 8 all the way to midnight so somebody have a time to go home rest refresh take a shower whatever you want to do and then you come here until we enter 2025 and I don't want to forget this but it has been a while since we chat a little bit I was chatting with brother Chad Lamb so he told me to greet the church so spoken word I greet you I pass your greeting from Brother ch's lamb and brother Chad whenever you hear this you're going to hear a spoken word saying what so by God grace we will continue to work he thought he would make it the last time he was here but he was down in South Carolina and he had to take a flight so for him to drive all the way there to hear was a little bit difficult so one of these day you will see him here ministering for us amen a true friend and a deep teacher and a wonderful Minister uh I I told him when I met him I said where were you all this time I was in United States they never even heard about you but God knew the right time that we had to meet and when I sit down I listen I say my goodness praise God a wonderful Ministry amen so I believe everything is clear brother Kelly if I forgot something you tell me if not so let's go straight to the reading of our scripture you need to stay really in tune and uh I told brother Robert I don't know why how far we will go because of the depth of this so keep your Bible I believe you have a lot of time to sleep and to relax better than me my wife can tell you what time I went to bed so you should be on fire amen okay we finished yesterday with the prenup out amen it is enter God enter scripture and against the word of the hour amen we clarify that we went into the detail and we went into spiritual prup those preconceived idea that you have before you enter marriage you're the one that are destroying your own marriages ask those that were there they will kind of help you out but all prenups were destroyed yesterday completely so all your preconceived idea that you have before you get married you say when I'm going to get married I'm not going to let a man rule over over me good luck and welcome to destraction into your marriage and this one say I'm not going to take a make a let a woman take over me Good Luck welcome to the marriage and then you're going to have disaster right amen so all your preconceive whoever so by himself before marriage destroy that thing amen your wife is not your stepfather hey you didn't get it you didn't get it your husband is not your father amen amen your spouse is not whoever significant other that abuse you or abuse people or abuse somebody in your family this is somebody different treat him according to the way God brought him in your life and don't try to hook anything or preconceived idea because you will destroy your marriage are we together are we together the reason why I just say that there is a sister from South Africa he said brother Stephen the little crms that you drop from question and answer when we are not there we just feed on those crms so sister wherever you are you can feed on those crme and make sure we free our marriages amen Oh Glory to God it started very good my my subject this morning is our life journey through Joseph's five garment part 40 can you imagine man you've been loaded amen the the theme we will talk about is the Fed Cal you remember since last Sunday right the FED calf offering amen now we should not be strange to you let's go to Psalm 82 I don't know when we're going to leave this scripture so if your spiritual tummy is small I will advise you to have a to go box because I don't have any choice amen if I follow the little tiny belly we would not move forward we have to debunk and to drop what we have to do he will free you amen sir amen and built rapturing faith and you will see how much God has been good to us verse one you know what flight attendant ah prepare for take off amen I won't tell you which flight we taking on because I don't want anybody to come after and say well we didn't understand this you know I had the quat that I remov I didn't want to put I have it all the way this morning but I took it away well brother Bram says that God uses a man according to his nature I wish I would have done that yes sir now it looks like it's too late it's done done somewhere yeah done below there I have a quote and brother brandham say even the word that man uses and his nature will blind some people and will open up the eyes of some people so I'm not shocked if somebody's blinded because I move my hand [Applause] you are pushing me too hard to read that quote but I'm trying to avoid that quote because it's it's it's it's a bazooka because some will say when you preach the gospel you need to remain on a purpose so if you move you're moving too much what do you really [Applause] want we are not [Applause] Catholics I'm sorry y I don't have any choice I got to read that quote okay are we [Applause] together you okay standing or sitting H spoken word it's hard to hide something from [Laughter] you uh okay tried to avoid it but whoever it's going to belong to get it my friend all right brother Bram say God this is after the seals for whoever here before and after to me it's the message of the earth ah so whoever want to wait after the seal it's after the seal brother Bram say God has selected the man for the age amen and selected message amen and even the nature of the man and what will go over in that age amen what he could put over how he could with the nature of of that certain man he could blind the eyes of others so if you are by blanded because of brother Bram suit yourself amen Amen brother Bram says he said he could blind the eyes of others the words that the man would [Music] say Amen the way he does what act maybe he does this amen would blind others and open others eyes are we together see he dressed the man in the type of dress that he was the what nature the what and everything just the way he had to be just perfectly selected for that certain people that he would call for that certain what age so let me be who I am and let me preach the way God made me to preach he will blind the eyes of some people and He will Open the Eyes of someone let me are we together from now on and forever remain silent on that [Applause] aspect amen amen so don't come again and say he's moving fingers like this if he you he confirmed the prophet that's right amen too much Catholicism in this message amen oh goodness because one preacher preaches a certain way everybody if one preacher move this way everybody young Minister don't change your nature where are they do you understand me brother Albert you stay the way you are brother Benjamin you stay the way you are brother CH Hamilton stay the way you are don't even try to copy [Applause] me be yourself God built you for a certain [Applause] purpose don't change your comp [Applause] amen glory to God let's go to Psalm 82 [Laughter] now GL glory amen I said that because he came through you will see a young sister want to change who she is yourself God built you a certain way and your makeup has a a decoding of your husband the day he sees you it will trigger something on you now you change that makeup you know what let's pray Heavenly Father Lord we approaching you humbly this morning Father thanking you for your grace your love your mercy and for everything you have been doing for us father this is as far as I can go with the ability you have given me but when it comes Lord father to bless to preach to speak to teach your children I am un to do anything Lord I only depend upon the holy spirit to come and move me completely out of the way and move the audience visible and invisible out of the way so that we may receive that which you have sto for us this morning Father we rebuke the devil and every spirit that is contrary to your divine nature away from this place may you come and bless our soul father in Jesus precious name amen amen God stands in the congregation of the mighty he judges among the gods you might be seated verse six I have said it's a declaration ye are Gods who's talking there God and all of you are children of the most high God open up our divine identity first before he tells you the fall identity in other word regardless of what's going to happen remember I have declared what I declare I said what I said and my counsel I won't judge I won't change my counsel it will remain that way whatever he spoke is already there in other word whatever will happen on this world will never change his mind am amen amen whatever will happen in the life of Jacob won't change God's mind because before Jacob was born I love him and that finish the story I love Jacob and I hated es no matter how much es is good God doesn't like [Applause] him amen verse seven but you shall die like what and fall like one of the what princes in other words God is aware of your failure before before you even do them [Applause] before you make a mistake God already [Music] [Applause] knew if you slow down I can't be able to move who chose the disciple Jesus who chose Judah Jesus who said Judah was a devil Jesus why do you think he didn't know who Judah was are we together and who chose Peter Peter can make a mess and Jesus even say get the behind me what Satan but Satan could not stay in the life of [Music] Peter but when Satan entered Judah he found something that is matching you don't have anything in you that matches the [Applause] devil are we together that's why you can be delivered because it's only temporary amen who deny Jesus three times Peter who did they give the key of the Kingdom Hallelujah to whom did God say go feed my sheep did he give it to John you need to know that God knew everything about you before you came into this worldall in other word after God looking it all the messy you going to make amen after he look at everything and the devil was standing there and say thank you and when God want to say something say no no no no no can you continue all the way to the end God say of course Satan I will continue all the way to the end they will teiz they will smoke finish anything else devil and the devil say no no no no no no his file is finished God say I have said he is a [Applause] God I have said that brother Tony is [Applause] God in other word I won't change my thoughts about my child because of what they [Applause] [Music] did oh God if we linger here we won't go let's go to Luke 15 amen amen amen you need to know how you talking to the devil there it is right there I don't know who taught us in this message that when we go into trial it means God doesn't love you I don't know who taught us this in the message a little suffering oh I believe that I'm not child of God have Jesus ever seen why was he suffering then I'm asking you a question the suffering of Jesus was based on what because he did something wrong so how was his suffering he didn't he never done anything wrong so suffering doesn't mean you did something wrong sometime we do things wrong but some time you didn't do anything wrong but God want to show [Applause] something let's go to Luke 15 verse 11 if you thereare you can say amen amen praise God the Bible says and he said a certain man had two sons ah this story is unbelievable two sons we got the Elder one and we got the younger amen the Elder is who or what according to the sons of Joseph the Elder is who Ephraim or Manas man man Manas where are you heading again chill out my friend this is the Gentile according to the sons of Joseph it is Ephraim amen amen glory to God he says and the younger one of them which is the Gentile said to his father father give me the portion of goods that falls to me and he refused what did he do why didn't he refuse because he knew what the son would do why didn't he say no no no no no no no no I know if I give it to you he you you will messed up the father look he said get it and the devil say get you amen he says and he divided to he's what how can you give a son something that you know he would go and Destroy because brother Bram says this brother Michael Deli he says and I can see this child now he's feeding Hogs here he's done in the pig pen slopping the Hogs and eating from the same slop backet feeding the Hogs think of it what he had left and what he had then that and the portion that he spent was really his fathers that he had earned but here he was in the pig pen and all all he could hear was a granting of H hogs in other words he was God's inheritance that we abused and destroyed and God knew that we would do it he knew that he's going to give us life and he knew that we going to take the body God will give us we will take the intelligence God will give us we will take the life God will I mean uh have given us and we will abuse it but despite that God gave it to us and sometime when you a sinner you don't even get sick why that William Marion Branham brother Branham says in Revelation chapter 5 God knowing that man will fall yet he could not make men fall God knowing man will be lost though he did not want anybody lost but to order that the great display of the attribute of God might be manifested to all men that he could be a what Redeemer he could be What A Savior man had to fall so your fall is important I know these are hard stuff to swallow so as long as my man can say Amen I'm okay amen you had to fall your fault was necessary your mistake was [Applause] important this is why some of the people that grew up not doing anything wrong God will shock you with something because you you you will begin to build a [Applause] self-righteousness so God will allow you to make a mistake and that bring guiltiness on you so you get humble [Applause] because I never done this I never done this I never done this I never done this in other word you saying there is nothing in you that you need to repent God say uh-uh uhuh that's not the way you work if there is nothing on you to repent the atonement doesn't have power the power of the atonement is when the atonement find you in a mess then they [Applause] I have a question uh brother Greg do you have a headache now if I give you taleno what do you need if you take taleno what will happen to you would you even understand the power of taleno because you don't have a headache but if you have a headache and I give you Talent now you will appreciate and have confidence in tal amen I don't know if that is okay now so the trial you go in your life amen he will make God display his power what the devil thought he's destroying it is now time for God to restore back and he will restore with something [Applause] better oh my god brother Bram say he was in him in man to do what then he was in God to do what redeem him again so God has a responsibility to redeem man and man has a responsibility to fall so do your fall and God will do his part amen I'm not preaching to you I'm preaching to the devil we did our part now it's God time to do his part in our life [Applause] you thought you were deceiving us you are not deceiving us you actually help us do our part so that the blame won't be on me but the blame will be on the devil even though I am the one who did [Applause] it is that a fair judge it is a fair judge because God judges according to his word praise God he says we have to have night time yes that's it to make what day right we have to have what sickness to make us enjoy what health everything a pro and a what a con so the pro and the C goes [Applause] together in other word if a c come in your life just be assured that as long as he came there must be a [Applause] pro are we together there is no trial that will happen on your life in your life that does have an attribute from God to supply that [Applause] trial I don't know if we together I don't know if we get whatever will come in your life just know there is already an answer for it he won't come if there is no answer because there is a cure medication that's why it's coming so when he comes just go back to God you say where is that [Applause] pill if it's a father says I am the god that supplier all your needs amen [Applause] are we together are we together when it happen don't be surprised don't be upset just say down you say no problem I know I know brother Stephen you don't know how hard it is God knows the harder one the harder the antibiotic the harder the trial the harder it means you are really [Applause] strong if you you you need to let me continue with the sermon so we can go if I'm dealing with a 5 years old amen how much strength do I need to punch him just a little bit so the strength of your trial tells you the level you are in your growth [Applause] [Music] because to knock an adult you need a really hard PCH so when the devil is punching hard it means that I am in a higher level wake up Church shut yourself you are somewhere with God this is not motivational speaking this is that the Lord [Applause] amen amen the two Thief were crucified because they were guilty the one who suffered the most was Jesus because Jesus was crucified not being guilty that's why brother Bram say what really killed Jesus was not the spear it was the grief so the punch of Jesus was greater because Jesus was the greatest sin on the cross right but when he did punch that was the greatest eror because he opened up the attribute he actually let the blood of the lamb to [Music] to the blood now was shed you can in other word it was good to keep the blood of Jesus in him if the devil was smart he should have keep the blood of Jesus in him he made a mistake and made a c now the blood is shed too late too late too late spoken word is Doom for Success amen are we together are we [Applause] together let's go to verse 13 because if I continue this way we won't we won't get to the subject let's go to verse 13 let's go my friend and not many days after the youngest son gather what all together and and took his journey into a what a far country Lord help me if I can reach this word far country amen far country and there wasted his substance with what righteous living he was no longer the father substance he BEC his substance amen Okay jump now to verse uh uh 17 and when he did what came to himself I might shock you but I don't have any choice the Bible say when he came to what his senses so everything that he [Applause] diden you guys spoken word spoken word spoken [Applause] [Laughter] word I'm giving you time to vent if you need a shout [Applause] shout do you have his record yes do you have his video yes do you have his first book account which prostitute women yes he was not [Applause] him I told you this will free [Applause] you we read the scripture over and over like almost 3 month we read the scripture over and over so who so who was doing those things hey answer me who was doing those [Applause] things in our in our fancy uh life way we believe that this candidate here that has been brought to our trial need to have a psychological test because he was not in the right mind when he perform everything so that his case can be dismissed he was sick he did it not in himself so how can you blame him why didn't you take him to the hospital because you didn't take him to the hospital that's why he did all the things he did now I'm talking like a lawyer why didn't you take him to the hospital if you knew he had a problem so how can you blame him in something he didn't know now that he got his right man give him a chance so we see if he's going to make a mistake again but he [Applause] won are we together are we together Hallelujah [Applause] so he came to what he came to himself amen meaning everything that he has done everything that he has done amen amen out of his mind because somebody lost his mind so if somebody lost their mind and he does something wrong do we blame the person or the sickness sickness so let's blame the sickness yes sir are we together yes sir are we together yes sir man lost man lost but I will give you a new name for this if I can reach where I'm going are we together now we clear now okay because when he came back to his mind he didn't even want to stay there when he came to his mind he didn't want to stay there he and and and he look he say wait a minute was that me who did this I was not supposed to be doing this as a son of my father this is not my behavior in other word the one that was doing that was uh Psalm 82 ver7 now Psalm 82:6 woke up and said no no no no that was not [Music] me I'm not even worthy I mean to be doing things like this let me go back to father and let me repent and say father I'm sorry what a right man amen jump to verse 20 my friend I believe now we we are getting the picture Okay verse 20 and he arose why he was not he didn't ER rise all this time because he was not in the right the Holy Spirit just dropped something straight to me right now because maybe somebody is struggling so you who are who is struggling maybe here on online listen closely who here can eat food from the pig pen raise your hand now if somebody is eating food from the pig pen how is his mind I'm saying how is his mind so whoever was struggling you gaed he lost his man that's why he could even eat with the pig because his mind was no longer right but when he came to himself nobody pray for [Applause] him they coming back to himself begin to remove the pig pen begin to remove everything and begin to turn him toward the right [Applause] direction I don't know if we together coming back to himself break [Applause] demons he break every chle in other word the devil have so bind this boy until the devil said this one I got him he will never come out of this but as soon as he came to himself remember Samson one day was put with B but when the spirit of the Lord came Samson just did this and the Bible say they broke like they were burned or something so when you come to yourself when you recognize who you [Applause] are are we together he Shake therefore away from you because brother Bram say he was hearing the granting of the pigs maybe the pigs are looking they say oh we got a human being companion after a while the human being became human being and the pig remain in the Lower State remember devil enter Pig so the devil will remain lower but you can get back up again in other way you have a power to go down and to rise back up again but the devil cannot back up again they remain on the pig and when they want to go somewhere they ask Jesus Christ let's go into the pig I hope somebody's clear now we clear now okay where are we at thank you Lord jum to verse 20 and he arose and came to his father but when he was yet a what a great way off his father did what saw him so when the father sees him coming home he already spoke it's a message that's right there was no phone call there there was no letter that was going and say son you need to come home amen if the son is coming home seemingly by himself the father already know that something took place amen and then the father saw him a gray off and his father saw him and had compassion not anger and ran and fell on his neck and did what kissed him did he kiss a clean son no did he say wait a minute you are full of germs go take a bath first and shave yeah so the father for the joy lost also his [Applause] mind ah don't worry let's continue my friend where are we at verse 21 and the son said to him father I have sin against Heaven who taught him and in your sight and I'm no more worthy to be called your son but the father who is already seemingly out of himself because the other son was trying to bring the father back to his himself like you are acting like you don't know what happened sir you need to get back remember this is the criminal one and the father is still in another one in other word the attribute of a father was Quicken amen he was a father amen but when he saw his son that he thought was dead came back he open up a different level of [Applause] fatherhood the first father was you reward a child only when they do good but this type of attribute expresses love when something wrong has been done amen it's a highest typ of love a love that love your enemies and those that did things wrong toward you and you still respond [Applause] good Jesus thought the the people he say if you do good to those who do good to you even The Sinner do it so to make a difference between you and a sinner you would do good to somebody who did wrong it's the highest STP of [Applause] love when the brother of Joseph are coming Joseph said do not worry I'm not going to kill you God Did It for a [Applause] [Music] purpose amen amen do you know when you go you bring good grades especially kids and when they come up they say daddy look at the great gra and daddy say you know what we're going to get you a gift somehow unconsciously I deserve it even if you don't say it I deserve it I I work hard I got good great that's why I got the gift but when you didn't work good and you know you don't deserve it and father expresses his love now you see your father in a different way that's what makes you love your father better because you found somebody who loves you in your weaknesses that's a true husband I hope is that okay I hope is that okay not when everything is doing wrong when I mean good no when something is wrong and he still L you [Applause] somebody from a married couple was pushing that up so you got that one right are we together where are we at my friend 21 sorry y I'm a pastor so the holy spirit is working with married couple young people and everything because a pastor feed the flock the lamb and RAM and everything so I have to give Rams and you and Lambs everybody got to get some food so we make sure you are fed are we together where are we 21 21 and the son said father I have sinned against heaven and in your sight and I'm no more worthy to be what called but the father said to his servant bring forth the what the best Rob from somebody who messed up somebody who messed up is getting a best Ro not a robe a bedroom what a amen and put put it on him and put a ring on what and Sh on what feet who ordered those things the father who requested those things the father what did the youngest son do to deserve all of this nothing so he was receiving everything without claiming it in our terminology by grace [Applause] merited amen amen amen am you don't understand when I say I'm merited when I receive something I'm merited you would know because I will really enjoy it that's right I will really really enjoy it the Bible says verse 23 and bring here the what who are the def C the father and do what kill it according to his son the son said that the father also had a kid yeah because the son say Sir why you never gave me a kid so in this stable they were different animals maybe I'm saying maybe so don't come after and say where is the coat maybe maybe there was some lamps maybe they were Sam maybe no not maybe we got a kid or a goat amen and we also have calf amen meaning we got uh a cow somewhere a bow somewhere Etc but the father through this uh uh Joy dis anointing instead of turning around and say get a lamb he said get a calf and not a calf a fatted [Applause] one why did he pick only the calf amen and not the lamb and he say bring here the fatted Cal and do what kill it so that calf has to be killed in that day amen the father never said oh he looks like he's hungry you know what uh you know what we cook yesterday it's in the refrigerator go ahead and give him some food no no no no no no amen his sacrifice cannot be a leftover I'm going somewhere my friend his sacrifice was not a leftover of another day abely are we together but it was a fresh kill a bleeding sacrifice the sacrifice of the present time a fresh a fresh [Applause] steak I don't know if you getting it I I don't know if you're getting it so to really deal with you God have to look for something fresh that's why the other leftover don't work with [Applause] you are we together remember last Sunday on the consecration of the priest the consecration was how many days it was seven days and each day what happen they have to kill a bullock a young Bullock every single day so the Bullock that was kill on Monday cannot be used on Tuesday the one that was pulled on Tuesday cannot be used on Wednesday but my time is the seven one so I must find the seven Bullock that have to be freshly killed where there is blood because eag suck on [Applause] blood I gave you that scripture before are we together are we together are we together are we together let me slow down right there jum to verse 29 and he answering said to his father Lo what many years this is the youngest son I serve you Nether transgress at any time your commandment and yet you never gave me a you know a kid is a goat so the younger brother I mean the older brother is claiming a kid based on his work right I don't know if you're getting me his work is righteousness it says righteousness by his work amen and he's claiming a kid amen but the younger one doesn't claim anything because he's Unworthy of anything his life looks messed up on any other angle compared to the oldest one but he's getting the [Applause] best spoken word help me my friend no matter how much a goat will grow it will never be the size of a cow [Applause] even if the go even if the goat have so many Long Horn that have already curve like this it will never reach the level of a [Applause] calf are we together are we together so no matter what's going to happen your level is so [Applause] high where are you going brother Steven with all of this where are you going where are you taking us amen last Sunday we found out that according to Exodus 40 I'm putting this you can take a screenshot or whatever we move on according to Exodus 40 we found out that the priesthood amen am was given to Aaron and to his son I'm trying to help somebody quickly so we go amen amen amen and then we found out that when it was time to consecrate the priesthood or the priest of the lord god require a certain offering for the SE offering of the priest now back up my friend okay and that offering was a young Bullock or a calf so we found out that a young bulock or a calf yes amen was a sin offering are we together a sin offering for the priest for the priesthood amen and this was in Exodus 29 keep that in mind amen are we clear there we found out that according to Leviticus 4 amen God made a difference between the priesthood and the congregation of Israel amen the priesthood every time they sin the offering must be a c are we together or a young bulock we together but when the congregation of Israel or the people of Israel the children of Israel all the congregation of Israel all the people of Israel when they sin the offering was a kid or a goat so God May set a difference between the line of the priest are we together and the line of the normal people are we together and this difference was so great until the priest or the L didn't have even a land let's go to number chapter one you need to keep your Bible I'm going to try to speed here let's go to number chapter 1 verse 45 father help me let me see where we are we are very good my friend God amen amen okay number one if you dare you can say Amen verse 45 so where all those that were numbered of the children of who Israel by the house of what from 20 years old and upward all that were able to go forth to war in what Israel God told Moses number all the trouble and Moses begin ruing so many Judah so many isach so many and he number all of them even manasse Ephraim all of them but there was one tribe that was not touched follow me my friend verse 46 even all that were numbered were 600,000 and 3,550 and they live but after the tribe of their their father were not number among them so when they are talking about the congregation of Israel they will number everybody but God said do not number the that's right in other words there is a separation follow me between the leat and the rest of the congregation are we together verse 4 uh8 for the Lord has spoken to for Mo uh to Moses saying only you shall not number the tribe of who Levi Nei take of take the some of them among the children of what Israel so when you dealing with Israel Li was taken out Li was special are we together you can number Israel but don't number don't mingle Israel with leave Amen in other word do not mingle the priesthood with the rest of the congregation amen are we together yes are we together let's go to Deuteronomy Verse 18 Deuteronomy 18 Deuteronomy comes after Numbers Deuteronomy 18 verse1 if you there you can say amen amen so God set a difference between the L where the iron and his priesthood are you remember last Sunday and the congregation amen if you seen you from a congregation go get a good if it's a l get a c I hope it's clearing now if it's the younger brother give me a goat the older brother give me my kid yes sir but when it's the younger brother who sins kill the FED Cal I hope we are getting together I don't know if you get what I just say somebody did it yes sir there was a difference in the offering when you see and you are under the priesthood your offering is a cal are we together when you see you are in the congregation of Israel your offering is a goat are we CLE now and we find out in the story of the prodal son when he's coming home the father say kill the calf but when the younger brother is put the elder brother is putting claims he's he's putting clim on a [Applause] goat and we know that the older brother is Israel and the younger brother is the Gentile are we together they go the go goes to Israel but the go is for the priesthood it's for the Gentile I hope we are getting together are we together in the back are we together are we together let's go to Deuteronomy 18 these things you go slowly and as we enter in Demon are flying away am when you go home whatever was was in a home you will be find out they already flew a home you will feel a peace at home hallah like you feel like I need to sleep are we together Deuteronomy 18 verse1 if you thereare you can say amen amen the priest The Who Levites so now we clear now right the priest The Who Levites so we talking about the priesthood and all the tribe of who Levi shall have no part this is God talking no inheritance with who Israel so if you go to Israel where is the land of deliver there is no land of deliver so God was hiding something there that there is a separation between the priesthood and the rest of Israel you cannot mix them together I hope we are okay now the Bible says they shall eat of the what offering of the Lord made by what in his what remember the fatted C when he was killed they have to eat it and only livei itat [Applause] sacrifices when you bring your sacrifice to the altar in Israel you let it there and you go it is the liver that kill it and they eat it nobody else can eat it only a l are we together when you kill a cal the L will eat it thank you my friend let me continue verse uh uh two therefore shall they the priest deliver have what no inheritance among the who Brethren the Lord is their inheritance if you look in and translation it means the Lord is their portion so the responsibility of the belongs in the hand of the Lord I don't know if you get it if you ask the Lord if you ask a where is where are your asset he said go ask God all the asset of deliver even the nourishment of the L even the restoration of the L were provided by God everybody else will work but the L don't [Applause] work the Liv work in the sanctuary amen and as they work that's the way they eat [Applause] amen leave don't need to have flocks you keep the flocks but you will bring it to [Applause] deliv so the portion of delivered is the Lord amen because one day pram stood and look at or [Applause] Rober and saw the big building of Ora robit and then he look at Billy Graham and saw the big building of Billy Graham he said Lord what have I done that you don't trust me with such a big things the Lord came down say William Bram I am your look up I am your person I am your provider I am your husband I am everything for you [Applause] are we together amen are we together amen are we together amen father help me amen amen so the difference is clear between the priesthood and the congregation of Israel that's correct are we clear now now when he come to delivered what does leave means brother Steven brother Bram says this oh Hallelujah if you can see what that Temple was that delivered was who the bride this is the perfect interpretation of the Bible am William Mar BR amen according to William Mar Bram delivered were who the bride our responsibility belongs to our husband amen amen the pr responsibility belongs to the husband your life belongs to [Applause] God oh glory to God glory to God are we together are we together my friend according to William Mar man this word is so juicy my friend it tastes so I wish I can get where I'm trying to get amen amen when I'm saying that let me enjoy Also myself because you are enjoying I need to also enjoy so give me some few minutes don't say oh you are doing this to show huh I'm also enjoying we are in this together God is the one preaching not [Applause] me deliv represented who the bride so come coming back here there is a difference clear between the priesthood of the brde and Israel the Brad offering is the Cal Israel is the kid that's why the old the son give me a kid but the younger one by Grace he doesn't ask for it it is provided a Fed C amen for seven days amen every day a the seven ches from Paul all the way to BR a cal every single day oh glory to God are we together amen uhhuh he says now when sin is what wakening on every hand the L is doing what is pulling their swords the holy God born what bride is standing out saying what Jesus Christ in the positive is Jesus Christ in the negative just how the same sin do what is still sin it is wrong to do these things that is what they are standing there with a sword friend are we together amen are we together amen now when it come to the sin of ignorance when he come to the scene of ignorance matter of fact all these animals we know represented who Christ we clear on that one we clear on that one brother Bram say all sacrifice represented who Christ so let's move on it's already there amen now when it come to the sin of ignorance something different comes what comes with the scene of ignorance in the scene of ignorance amen when a preach sin do you follow me verse three according to Leviticus 4 do sin according to the sin of the people then let him bring for his sin the priest delivered the Brad we okay now a young what Bullock which is a cal how without a young bulock without what blemish so who can be that young Bullock without blemish in the Old Testament just like God was leading who Israel all what the sacrifices and the what atonement and everything in the Old Testament just spoke of who Christ and in Christ the center of the full plan of God's Redemption for what the human race everything you have need of tonight is where in Christ because he is your portion amen amen hallelujah we together now amen are we together now amen now when a preed by ignorance I'm waiting for you to so in you ready when a seen by a man [Applause] lost I don't know if you got because this boy came to himself so everything he was doing was by ignorance you didn't get it yet I'm giving people time everything he did he was ignorant of it because he was ashamed of having done that when he came back to his right mind when a preach sin by ignorance are we together are we together then his offering is a c now you begin to understand why the father say kill the father C you begin to understand are we together but not only that when it comes to ignorance verse 13 if the whole Congregation of Israel sin through what ignorance and the thing be hidden from the eyes of what so the they won't be aware that they did something wrong amen and they have done somewh against any of the Commandment of the Lord concerning things which should not be done and now how guilty next verse when the sin which they have Sinn against is what no so Israel will sin by ignorance not knowing are we together then for them to know somebody must let them know and when their eyes are open that what they have done was bad then the offering that goes with that become the FED cast let me go back again are we together verse 14 when the sin which they have sinen against it is known then the congregation shall offer a what a young Bullock to a young Bullock for what the sin so when Israel sin under ignorance under blindness I hope we getting that because when you blanded you don't know what you're doing and the Paul say Israel was blanded that's the reason why they killed the Messiah right yes are we together when they see on the blindness amen they need somebody to make known their sin are we together and when they recognize that we kill the Messiah you need to give them a sin offering but the sin offering will be a young Bullock the offering of the bread of the L will now become also the offering of the [Applause] Jews I don't know if together the offering that is purging the Brad must also go toward Israel to remove them from the SC of [Applause] ignorance the servant seal for the Brad must become the seven trumpet for Israel the same message that deliver the BR must be also taken to the Jews to deliver the Jews if in the bride he was by a prophet in the Jews he must be taken by a prophet amen so a prophet must make them know the sin that they did and give them the [Applause] C [Applause] H I don't know if we together I don't know if we together why they Cal why they Cal why they Cal father help me why the C we found out that levite were consecrated amen am in Exodus 29 that's right you remember last Sunday you remember that Sunday do you remember that amen and when God said consecrate deliver God say you know what Moses look which offering God say take a calf for Aaron and his son why not a lamb why not a realm why not a kid goat God say Moses Cal that was Exodus 29 let's go to Exodus 32 few days later that's how people love to be so we can preach like that Exodus 20 to 32 if you thereare you can say amen amen and when the people saw that Moses delay to come [Applause] down can I continue or we good can I continue or we good out of the mountain the people gathered themselves together to who Aaron and say to him up make us what God which shall go before us for for as for this Moses the man that brought us up out of the land of Egypt we know not what is become of him and Aaron said to them break off the Golden Earring which are well in the ears of your wives and do and what and your sons and what daughters and bring them who unto me and to and all the people did what break off their Golden Earrings which were in their ear and did what brought them unto Aaron and he perceived them at their hand and fashion it with a graving too after he had made it a what a molten C instead of for to make an ad the only ad Aon could come out with in his expiration was not a lamb it was not a it was only a [Music] calf I don't know if we together sir in other word the offering of sin of Aon came before he performed the [Applause] [Music] [Applause] sin I'm going slowly my friend which Which chapter are we at 32 we on 32 amen amen so there are three chapter in between my friend are we together God before Aaron did anything God said hey call Aon and his son call the priesthood call the lad call the Brad amen and make a sin offering for the Brad and the sin offering was given of a calf then later on in the life of Aon Aon make a mistake and the mistake he's making is a cal which is exactly the offering of sin that God gave before his [Applause] sin are we together are we together let me start it again school is on are we together in Exodus 29 Aaron didn't do anything wrong God say bring Aaron to consecrate him they brought Aon God say he need a sin offering which offering he said get a calf a calf what about a lamb a calf they brought a calf kill it for Aaron so Aaron is covered are we together then in the life of Aaron down the road Aaron make a mistake because of the pressure of the congregation are we together and his mistake came accidentally a calf so God s the calf before Aaron made the mistake I hope now you're getting it in other word the sacrifice of sin for Aaron was slain before the act of [Applause] SE now you begin to understand now you begin to understand so when Aaron is making a mistake he doesn't surprise God God say I already slew a car for AR in other word your sacrifice was slain the lamb was slain before the foundation of the world am so before you make any mistake God already slew your sacrifice so when you making a mistake the sacrif the atonement is already [Applause] sing I don't know if we together I don't know if we together why was their sacrifice a CF and when he make a mistake he brings a CF and a CF is what Aton his sin and a calf was for the sin offering and the sin of Aaron was a calf golden cast God atoned his sin before even he made [Applause] it that's why in so to he said remember ye God even though you going to fall like man but remember you are God because God already flew the sacrifice he knows the mistake you going to make but there is already an atonement that is flying and follow in your [Applause] life are we together are we together are we together have i l someone when we look at the ignorance amen we found out that Gentile were ignorant we didn't have God we read this last uh Sunday amen and the Bible say God winked God closed his eyes he doesn't want to see and he just suffer say just leave him alone am amen why is he linking is he winking we found out that later on the levitical priesthood was change and put into melkisedek because Christ was the end of the law follow me my friend Paul say in Galan he said but before Faith came amen we were kept under the law shut up unto the faith which should what afterwards be revealed so Faith was coming in the future wherefore the law was only what to bring us unto who that we might be justified by faith are we together but after after that faith is come we are no longer under a what a school master so when Jesus Christ came the law must be abolished because the priesthood now need to change from liver unto MEC that's why Jesus have to face the high priest are you together are we together are we together do you know what disqualified the priesthood of Li do you know what disqualify him do you know what he wasas asked Jesus Christ he said don't you hear everybody had they accusing you and Jesus was already sitting like this and CA say I commend you iure you by the Living God you need to answer when he say that he said tell us if you are the Son of God the Messiah it's written in your Bible but we know now what Son of God means because according to John 5 when Jesus say I'm a Son of God it means he was what equal with who so he asked Jesus Christ tell us if you are the Son of God if you are the Messiah if you are God as a human being tell us and Jesus say you said it in other words I am that God when he said that K took his clothes and T them down and it was a law in the levitical PRI that a high priest cannot tellar clo so before meis priesthood the levitical was completely disqualified and he was disqualified by the Revelation that God became a am men hallu Hallelujah and I believe we need to tell some levitical priesthood in this message and my way of telling is God told me I am God so you can tell your [Applause] clothing he start preaching the people that they are god of you say that I am what he said I am God if he going to tell your theology Let It [Applause] Be Moses under the blood of bulls and goat God told him you are God but me under the blood of the Lamb not the typ but the antip how can I doubt [Applause] are we together are we together are we together so the levitical priesthood gave away and the Mec took over and when he took over because we Gentile were far away the Paul say whereby that in the time pass who Gentile how In the Flesh not in the soul GLE In the Flesh who are called what uncircumcision by who circumcision in the flesh made by what the Jew that at that time he were without who Christ being how aliens from the Commonwealth of Israel and how strangers from the Covenant of Promise of Promise having what and without who God in the world but now in Christ Jesus ye who are sometime were far off are made n by what by the blood of Christ the youngest son who was Far Away Now is mad and because we came back who are we according to First Peter 2 he said ye also as what Lively stones are building up a what a spiritual house and what a holy priesthood to offer up what spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God by who Jesus Christ and Peter continue he said but he are a what a chosen generation a what a royal priesthood Royal from Judah the tribe of Judah the lineage of MEC amen a what a holy nation A peculiar people that he should suff for what Praise of him of him who had called us out of what Darkness into what His Marvelous Light which in time pass were not the people but I now the people of [Applause] God are we together are we together let's get a different angle of this thing take judges 6 amen prise God take the Book of Judges chapter 6 my friend follow me carefully where are we at we good on time if your tummy begin to feel let the Deon bring you a tog go box I don't have a choice my friend amen amen amen let's look at this card Judges chapter 6 if you dare you can say amen amen it SS for you more relaxes you so you can soak in again amen you there you need to have your Bible my friend yes judges 6 verse1 and the children of Israel did what evil in the sight of the Lord and the Lord delivered them into the hand of who Milan how many years seven years is that okay now why not 6 years why not uh 2 years how many years 7 years so the time of captivity the time of captivity of Israel amen is what s years seven years we clear follow me carefully amen so if you have uh on the first year if you have uh uh a goat that is born so by the time your captivity finishes how old will be the goat seven years thank you let's go verse two and the Hand of median Prevail against Israel and because of the medidan the children of Israel made there is so much here I'm going to stay on the surface made them then which are in the mountains and caves and stronghold and so he was when Israel has son that the midianite came up and the Amal and the children of the East even they came up against them verse four and they encamp against them and destroy the what increase they didn't destroy anything but they increase right I don't know if you clear so in the first year when Israel saw amen and he produces crops are we together yes sir amen and the CS begin to flourish this Army will wait they don't they were not attacking Israel when they were sewing they were not attacking Israel when Israel was waiting for the Harvest they only attack when the Harvest have come after a new crop a new food is come up in Israel I don't know if you're getting me then they come and destroy the new food they attack only the new food and they leave Israel and they waiting for the next year with the next new food they only destroy the increas yes something that was not there it was the

this message is carrying them loose amen bringing Israel from the old atonement into the new one amen go home relax replay this again so we can dig into this more and handle the FED Cal let's pray Heavenly Father Lord we are approaching you again humbly father this afternoon Lord thanking you for your grace for your love and your mercy and for helping us through this sermon because Lord we are very Unworthy of receiving all of this you only took Calvary so that we can be beneficiary of these things that's right Father I remember years that we were reading the Bible and not understanding anything we can read a story and don't know what we are reading and we wonder why is this calf this Bullock but today Father this Bible became a love book to us a book that when we can read we can see between the line and we can understand the Plan of Redemption of our life yes the sacrifice of the fatted calf for the younger child have to free him completely a sin offering that cut down idolatry a sin offering that remove everything that we did when we were blind a sin offering that pleaded for our ignorance Lord and bring us perfect in your sight Lord may you help the congregation and everyone streaming online and those that will stream to go home and to pray so that you will continue to unfold to them that before we made any mistake we can name on this Earth our sacrifice was already given our lamb was slain before even the foundation of the world thank you Father before you created this Earth that we living in you already slew the lamb knowing everything that we will do why would you slay the lamb when nobody have seen why would you give Aaron a sacrifice of a of a cal when he has not done the golden calf yet because you a God that have preemptive struck father you moveing before the enemy can see you declared the the end from the beginning you saw exactly what going to happen and that sacrifice that's why when we were yet sinner you even died for us Lord on Calvary when you died on Calvary many of us were not even born none of us that is here was born but that atonement is following us and when we make a mistake we find out that there was already an atonement that respond to the mistake we will make father may you free any guilty [Music] person so that they can be free to approach the throne of grace with boldness knowing that as long as they claiming on that sacrifice father you can never see them as a sinner and don't even remember what they did before Lord we commit everything unto the hand touch the sick and The Afflicted because because of that
