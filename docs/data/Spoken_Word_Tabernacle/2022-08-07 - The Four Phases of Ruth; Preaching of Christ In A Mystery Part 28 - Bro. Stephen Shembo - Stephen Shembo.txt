when they come back they will appreciate and say praise god now we see what we're talking about but i'm proud of them they look very good very good singing and everything i'm telling you it's good amen if you miss it you go look at the streaming and you will see very good very good very good oh my god i'm proud of them you're not happy that's your problem i am happy amen i've seen craziness all around the message among the youth people and when i look at them i'm like thank god i am proud amen blessed be the name of the lord let's go to our scripture this morning what i have is very loaded so i don't know how far i'm going to go i tried last week i could not even get to a third of the sermon because of the seal evidence and the open evidence but at least somebody really gathered the seal evidence and the open the bible is open is written it's a double bible it's one bible but it's double amen there is a written part of the bible and there is an unwritten part of the rubble amen it is one sword but it's double it's double age amen it's one evidence but it's double amen it is 24 stone it's still 12 12. but the double one have to be inside jordan and the other one outside jordan and before you can take the rapture before elijah take the rapture he must see not the open you need the inside evidence because the inside will give you rapturing faith without that even though the new elijah have to cross elijah have to go yes the lord is taking up elijah but before elijah be taken up he have to see the seal evidence amen when he see the seal evidence then he gives you rupturing faith then on the other side you can go everybody okay glory to god if you miss it you need to go back and sit and review and review and review if you clearly notice you're getting two sermons on sunday i don't know if you already caught that if you think you're getting one sermon you're not [Laughter] genesis chapter 2 at least you're doing good even though we're missing some people so i'm happy genesis chapter 2 i have to go back again to the same scripture because i can't i could not even touch the surface so hopefully let's see how far we can go i was planning on getting wednesday to push the butt we got brother nikki from south africa it's missionary season there are brother coming up so i have to give a little space so you can enjoy other ministries amen genesis chapter 2 if you dare you can say amen and i will let you sit glory to god genesis chapter 2 verse 20. amen the bible says and adam gave names to all caddo you might be seated that's the problem you start unfolding now amen and adam gave name to all cattle and to the fowl of the air and to every water so adam is the one that called the serpent serpent everybody okay amen amen okay but for adam there was not found a help made for him something that is very suitable for him and the lord god caused a deep sleep to fall upon adam and he slept he didn't die he slept amen and he took one of his ribs not two how many ribs [Music] let me keep moving and close up the flesh instead thereof everybody okay and the rib which the lord god has taken from adam or from man made here not even that's right amen you need to keep your bible today he didn't make eve he made a woman ever care and brought her to the man that's what happened in marriage and adam say this is now born of my bones and flesh of my flesh she shall be called uh who gave the name to all the beast and caddo who gave the name to the woman so every species will name my adam so adam name the beast the caddo and everything and then adam also name his help which is a woman and when we talk about the beast we are specific here because we're dealing with the serpent amen hallelujah because she was taken out of a man out of man we will handle this down the road therefore shall man leave his father and he is who is the father of adam and shall cling to his wife and there shall be one flesh they were both naked and the man and his wife and were not ashamed lord help me to get to that go to chapter three it's beautiful when you navigate this all the scripture lining up together straight from genesis all the way amen amen verse 3 now the serpent was more subtle so according to the scripture the serpent the first characteristic is that the serpent was more subtle what does he mean sado it's more than that amen the serpent was more subtle than any beast more subtle than any beast in other words the category of the serpent is in the category of the beast amen they didn't say he was more sadder than the than the fishes they didn't say he was more sadder than the fowl of the air amen they say he was more subtle than the beast and any beast of the field which the lord god has made and he said to ever so there is a going on something going on between the serpent which was a beast and a woman there is an interaction between the woman and the beast [Applause] for young people beauty and the beast you think they put it up like that for games and he said to the woman yeah has god say you shall not eat of every tree of the garden everybody jump to verse 13 one service relax get your bible because we're gonna get deep amen and he's gonna answer a lot of question verse 13 if you're there you can say amen and the lord god say to the woman not eve what is this that you have done and the woman say the serpent begot me everybody and i did eat not the snake the serpent everybody and the lord god said to the serpent because you have done this you are cursed above every water he didn't say above every fowl or above every fishes it's the characteristic of it the serpent is among the animal that is under i'm going like this so our children understand where the serpent seed comes from amen everybody here without any question because there are people in the message for years they don't understand things [Music] amen above all the cuddle and above every what of the you don't see them putting them under the creeping things or with the foul that's the characteristic of the that's the category of the serpent and above every beast of the field upon your belly now it's a different thing so the serpent was not walking upon his belly before so the serpent was an upright creature you cannot put somebody on the belly if they were already on the belly is that okay i'm going clearly so we don't have any question anybody here if somebody is already on the belly how do you put them on the belly for you to drop somebody in the belly that person must have been upright and brother branham when he say these things he never even give scripture he just let you go with it amen that's why the message is perfectly in line with the scripture perfectly not almost perfectly i'm not talking about your grammar [Music] amen he said upon your belly shall you go and that's how you eat all the days of your life so right here we understand that the serpent was an upright creature amen but the curse turn him into a snake that's the curse amen it is clear hallelujah verse 15. and i will put enmity who's going to put in meeting remember that i hope i can get away i'm going to go i will put in metroid between you who who is you the serpent and the water so there is wall from eden [Music] everybody okay everybody okay now everybody okay the word from eden is between the woman and the serpent [Music] okay i wish i can have my time to drop there so there is war that started in eden in genesis so in genesis precisely in eden amen war or enmity amen amen started between the serpent amen and the water we okay now amen if you keep that now you can see it all over the scripture that's right amen everybody okay and between your seed the seed of who the seed of who so when brother branham says serpent seed is that a problem it's not a problem do you read your bible or not do people read the bible the serpent has a seed i'm not saying brother branham say i'm saying the bible say before i put brother brother because what branham is already lining up with the bible gonna put in mitui between you and the woman and between your seed and so the woman has a seed the reason why you're reacting like that you are reasoning let's repeat what the bible says let's go back to the bible back to the bible back to the bible the bible said the woman has a seed does a woman ever have a seed please repeat with me let's read it together do you see now do you see now like i was asking a sister i said what do you see she say i'm i'm overthinking i said you don't want to accept i just say what you see in the scripture it's the second oil buddy amen let's read it again between your seed and her seed so the woman has a seed how can a woman have a seed so war is between the serpent and between the water and the serpent has a seed everybody and the woman also has a seed but we know women don't have seed you see now this message is beautiful and you there he shall bruise your head anybody care the seed of the serpent everybody care well bruise let me see again no and you'll see the seed of the woman will bruise your head everybody here if you look he say your head it's a personal pronoun your head so this seed of the woman when he attacked he attacked the head amen but here the attack of the seed of the woman he always attacked the head are we okay are we okay are we okay amen when david met goliath we okay now when he look at goliath he never say i'm gonna catch your arm he never said i'm gonna catch your foot he said i'm gonna catch you why did he always attack the head [Music] you need to know the origin of david amen and when he took the slingshot he targeted the head because the seed of the woman usually attacked the head they don't go in the back they are not afraid they go through head collision [Music] oh glory to god see what i told you i was in honey amen and it shall bruise your head and you shall bruise his water he's here so it's a man hey please let's go back let's go back he shall bruise your head and you shall bruise water so his is who the seed of the woman is he is so the woman have a male seed [Music] where did she get it [Music] this one attacked the water amen where was wolf sleeping everybody okay everybody okay why is he having defeat like brass [Music] but in revelation 10 they are pillars of fire can a snake touch the fire amen everybody okay amen [Laughter] let's go to leviticus 24. and i want to remind you on 20 the bible called eve the mother of what all the living amen eve means the mother of what all the living i love this quote in this point brother branham say scripture does not play with word amen amen amen whatever is in the record is there for the anointed eye to see it is there for uh genesis 3 20 and adam called his wife now or his wife named eve because she was the mother of all living but no scripture ever said that adam is the father of all living why let's go to leviticus glory to god leviticus 24 1 and the lord spoke to moses saying command the children of israel that they bring to you pure water olive oil beaten for the light amen to close the lamps it's the light that light is the candlestick and the candlestick have lamps that's why brother bottom say the correct name should be called lamp stand not candlestick it's right here brother brother didn't give you that scripture it's right here amen and to cause their lamps remember the foolish virgin also had lamps to cause the lamps to burn out so to the fire that was going on the candlestick was coming from the pillar of fire we know that amen but to keep the fire burning it's the uh it's the it's the responsibility of the priest to continue to put oil all the time everybody here verse three outside the veil of the testimony or where the ark is which is the holy place outside the veil outside the holy the holiest now you are in the holy place where the candlestick was amen outside the veil of the testimony the testimony here means the ark in the tabernacle of the congregation shall aaron order it from the evening not from the morning to the evening he started from the evening if you go the lord created the evening and the morning not the morning and the evening so the evening have something the way you start not morning evening you start from the evening tomorrow morning you will see that in a numbering amen from evening to the morning before the lord continually and it shall be a statute forever in your generation he shall order their lamps it's plural because there is seven lamps in one light one candlestick everybody okay he shall order the lamps upon the pure candlestick everybody clear now so what you have in the candlestick is seven lamps that are combined together into one light everybody here and he shall order the lamps upon the pure candlestick before the lord how continually in other words the responsibility to keep the candlestick burning all the time belongs to the priest anybody here and if the priests neglect to put oil what happened to the lamp everybody okay now praise god so the going out of the lamp is a negligence of the priest amen we okay now we okay now we okay amen let's go to uh daniel chapter 12. then we can pray hallelujah glory to god if i preach this speedily you will lose a lot of stuff daniel chapter 12 if you're there you can say amen verse 7 and i heard the man clothing lining which was upon the waters of the river this man is standing upon the waters a man both feet upon the water when he helped when he held up his right hand and his left hand to heaven and so by him that live forever that he shall be for a time times and a half what does it mean and when he shall and when he shall have accomplished to scatter the power of the holy people all these things shall be finished and i heard but i understood daniel heard but he didn't understand you can hear without understanding the second thunder the seventh and the seventh and the third pool they turned to the teleport we were hearing that but we didn't understand everybody here hallelujah dan said i oh my lord what shall the be the end of these things and he said go your way daniel for the word of water [Music] and everybody okay until the time of thee i cannot give it to you it doesn't belong to you it's for another dispensation this word that is that are closed up and that are sealed we see that in revelation 10 what do they do to the believer that hear them verse 10 many shall be water they are purified not by the open world everybody okay anybody okay it is the same word that the people don't want to hear in the message [Music] you're preaching mysteries mysteries mysteries mystery do you really know a mystery [Music] amen they shall be purified kama and made water so how can you be white without the breaking of the seal to unfold the sealed word because this word is not written it is sealed the bible has a written word and the word that was now written the word that was now written was sealed the sealed evidence amen and made white and do what try but the wicked shall do wickedly who is the wicked and none of the wicked shall understand but there the wise virgin what made them wise but here so the one who understand must have the second oil because the second oil qualifies you to be wise and the wise shall understand everybody clear let's pray heavenly father lord we are approaching you again humbly this morning father thanking you for your grace your love your mercy and for everything you have been doing for us father this is as far as a man can do read the holy scripture lord when you given him an ability but when he comes to unfold and to minister to your children father he only take a supernatural action of the holy spirit father may you move humanity and human element completely away from us may you come and minister to your children may you remove every demonic spirit making the people slumbering and all kind of destruction father may you bring us all in one thought this morning that you may speak to your brother and father bless them this morning as we humbly ask it father in the name of jesus christ amen i'm going to read one more scripture quickly it's in revelation 10. the bible says and i saw another marty angel came down from heaven clove with a cloud do you know what it means and a rainbow upon his head you know what it means but we will come back to this down the road and his face was as he wear the sun you know what he means and his feet as pillars of fire everybody and he had in his hand a little book open and he set his right foot that looked like pillar of fire upon the sea and he set his left foot upon the earth amen number one he set the two feet one upon the earth one upon the sea then he didn't stop there anybody okay when the two feet are positionally placed then he releases the thunders you can read the scripture over and over and he keeps opening up here he never spoke the thunders until he positionally placed his feet a certain way amen when he placed his feet then he cried then they shout comes everybody here and with a loud voice as when the lion roared and when he cried seven thunders under their voices my subject this morning is what we could not get last sunday it is the four faces of roof the second oil and the beast when we're dealing with the second oil we already seen that the virgin have two containers there was one container that one reservoir that was already in the lamp and that was already burning with oil but the emphasize is not on the first reservoir but it's on the refilling oil that was kept until the coming of the broad group everybody okay so far blessed be the name of the lord in our tabernacle language we are on the threshing floor with roof and roof is in the holy place this is very important brother sam gave me this quote but what i'm saying this story of ruth was written and all the old manuscript the old testament stories or books when they were segregating the bible when they were putting the bible together the holy men when they were trying to put it together in the old testament this book of roof was one of the outstanding books that they accepted so it was not an easy book to put in the bible [Music] when the people were putting the bible together when they look at the book of roof it seems so strange everybody here because moses you can easily see god coming the law and everything if you look in the book of roof there is no angel [Music] anybody here it doesn't say an angel came down it's like a love story but for some reason every time they want to throw that book away they are known to distract them [Music] ever here and they ended up looking like you know what let's just put it there and they put it and brother branham say why he said if it is just a love sorry why would the writers and the ancient sage accept this book as water so when they put that in the bible they recognize that this book even though we don't see angels angel of the lord and things like that this book is inspiring there is something special about this book brother branham said because there is an open revelation [Music] everybody okay everybody okay everybody good because there is a hidden revelation so there is something that is coded amen amen and in this hidden revelation of the book of ruth everybody okay you catch the real meaning it shall bring you real [Music] not close to god not close to god it will bring you very close to god it will put you in the feet of boaz [Applause] everybody okay look at the book of ruth and folded the moses in the tabernacle because the tabernacle was in roof the thunders were in the roof the seals were in ruffle the seven churches is wearing roof the candlestick wearing roof [Music] everybody okay it looks like the rope the the the very book of roof is the book of redemption [Applause] everybody okay everybody okay how can you read the roof and you understand it look through the tabernacle where you are today with your life now you begin to understand if you believe jesus christ or not you begin to understand why you need to get baptized you begin to understand why you need this why you need this why you need this why you need this it takes the book of ruth to bring you closer to god very close to god in other words this book will put you in the holiest [Music] everybody okay so far brother branham says this hallelujah he said all this cult that you see today and all these operas and all these things and ism today in other words what you see today happening in the news by god's grace [Music] it is everyone written in water where he had its beginning back there and it just got another so what you might call today something in the scripture it is there it is only written in a different name than what you call it today everybody here but how do i know it's the same thing brother bonham say you watch the working of the spirit in that day in other words every spirit is known by each characteristic in other words a tree is known by its fruit anybody okay blessed be the name of the lord he said you watch the working of the spirit in that day and watch how it's working today amen and you shall see it is the very in other words when you are looking at something you need to pass the name amen but here you need to look at the manifestation of something and you go back to the scripture and you look at what happened in the scripture even though it is another name don't worry about the name it is the same thing amen amen everybody here amen if in the bible god was discerning the thoughts of the people giving the birth to the congregation everybody he used a body there brother brother said he was not the body of jesus christ because jesus was not born there hey back here so god manufacture a body that he borrowed over there whatever name he gave to that body it is not a problem anybody here if he called that body choice that's no problem the problem is what did he do in that body everybody here and what is he doing today if the action he did there is the same today it is telling you it is the same spirit you cannot have the spirit of jesus christ and you acting like the devil let's keep moving brother branham say you'll be surprised to know that some of it is in the highest ecclesiastical realms everybody okay brother branham says this again he said everything that there is today had its beginning and everything that there is begin in genesis remember life began in genesis death began in genesis and all touch everybody okay begin in so when you read genesis there is more than what you can see with your eyes hallelujah he said right and wrong oh begin in genesis if you study the scripture real closely you shall find out that even the ism and the courts of today had the beginning in all them aims that we have today beginning genesis now today they polish it up and make it look like something else but it is still that all evil spirit if you shall watch the nature of it and the way he does water amen so don't tell me the name is christian everybody okay even if they call it jesus christ you must watch the operation of jesus christ everybody okay even if they say it is christian music watch the operation of that christian music [Music] because it will be very close that it will deceive even the very late so you cannot be caught up with i'm a message believer i want to see which message are you talking about everybody here we might be in the same camp but we don't believe the same message amen everybody okay so far blessed be the name of the lord when we talk about this virgin we found out that there were 10 virgins they took their lamp everybody okay and they went to meet the bridegroom praise god now i'm leaving and the wise took oil in their vessels you understand this so what made them wise is because they took the second oil in the vessel with the lamp ever here but that oil never was used everybody okay until the midnight because when they deported this is the vessel this is their lamp everybody okay this is the lamp or whatever way they have and the flame there amen when they departed their lamp had oil inside everybody okay and they also had oil on this side amen by the first lab everybody qualified to meet the bathroom i don't know if you're getting there are you with me by the first lamp oil everybody qualified to meet the bird group because everybody was engaged everybody was fiance everybody was espoused by the first oil but not everybody entered [Music] everybody okay everybody okay what happened when they pick up the festival when they pick up their lamp everybody have oil so they went and they start waiting for the bread room if the bread groom would have come right away i'm going slowly i am going slowly if the bread gum would have come right away everybody will get into the marriage [Music] we okay for some reason the bride don't push the break everybody okay the bible says that while the bridegroom did what they did what why did the bridegroom tell me you see i am in introduction anybody here why did the bridegroom tell you amen the tearing of the bridegroom everybody here everybody here is to make the first one run out [Applause] do you follow me do you follow me the tearing of the great room is a tearing for disqualification do you follow me let me go slowly because some are still lost in gps so let me try slowly if the ground room is coming at 10 o'clock everybody here you put your oil your oil is working till 11 30. everybody care if the bridegroom come at 10 o'clock all of you will enter the bus everybody here so the bridegroom terry so that he come after 11 30. make sure the fish oil is completely gone the tearing of the bread room is a process of this qualification elimination let's go to first samuel take your bible to first samuel you are looking at the love of god the love of god is not his love is elective [Music] is not your love [Music] his love say i hate esau amen let's go to first samuel chapter 10. the tearing of the bridegroom lord help me if you dare you can say amen verse one you there then samuel took a vial of oil everybody okay and pour it upon his head the head of saul and kiss him and say is it not because the lord has anointed you to be captain over his water so saul is anointed do you follow me to be king of israel so when saul is coming up he have the anointing everybody here so everybody will see that's the choice of god anybody okay we okay [Music] job to verse eight samuel tells so he say you shall go down before me to gilga you remember and behold i will come down to you to offer burn offering and sacrifice sacrifices or peace offering how many days you shall do it everybody okay we okay now you shall terry until i come to you and show you what you shall do deterring time was how many days so on the first day samuel can go to sleep he can be dancing doing whatever he wants maybe on the sixth day he begin to fix everything he say today is the sixth day samuel is coming he's ready anybody okay go to first go to chapter 13. if you dare you can say amen chapter 13 verse 8 you there verse uh verse 8 and he perry how many days but who was he waiting for the prophet and look what the prophet does the prophet also pushes the break everybody okay soul is already anointed with an oil and god is trying to put the final seal in the kingdom of soul to make sure this kingdom will never be changed and but here he gave solid time to wait when it's seventh day samuel terry saw that the oil everybody here that oil ran out it took seven days it took seven days it took seven days for the oil they gave him seven day go seven days the first day the oil is working the second day the old age work they turned on the seventh day at the evening time everybody okay everybody okay and he carries seven days according to the set time the who why did selma give him seven because seven is god's time so the prophet knows what he's doing amen according to the satan that samuel has appointed but samuel came not to gilgal everybody okay anybody okay why samuel why amen from the first day to the second day to the seventh day so qualify as a good boy he was waiting for samuel but the seventh day will really show what is the character of soul amen do you follow me if you catch soul the first day he can tell you samuel didn't say today that's why i went to walmart he's right you catch him the fifth day he said no samuel told me he will come on the seventh day why should i worry that's the reason why i travel down to our cancer arkansas everybody but on the seventh day saul is back again so according to everything soul is good but the prophet pushed the break the tearing of the prophet what does it do to saul we okay anybody okay and the bible says this but samuel came not to gilgal and the people were scattered from him and saul say so that patience also was not with saul even the people even the people could not wait amen and so say bring here a burnt offering to me and peace offering and he offered the burn of him and he came to pass are you following me that one ah soon everybody okay as soon as he had made a name god laughter so he consumed the sin correctly so you cannot say no i just touched the woman no no no no go to the hotel pay the bills so everything can be traced a doctor we cannot because at the beginning you say no no no no i felt like but i was still struggling i said jesus jesus no no no no no no no that that spirit is still there go ahead and consume now we don't know what you're gonna say anybody okay no problem and he come to pass that as soon as he has made an end of offering the burning sacrifice behold samuel came and so why not to meet him that he must salute him and samuel say what have you done how did he know shall disobey him he's not there yet but when saul is coming he say what did you do hey samuel good to see you what did you do how did samuel know but here the tearing of the prophet unfold the character of soul whether he is qualified for the kingdom or not everybody okay the bible says this he say and samuel say what have you done and so say because i saw that the people were scattered from me and that you came not within the days appointed and that the philistines gather themselves together and make much therefore said i the first thing will come now upon me to yoga and i have not made my simply made supplication to the lord i force myself therefore and offer the burn offering and samuel said to so you have done stop you have done do you get it aha you get it you get it you get it you acted as a foolish virgin that's why saul was saved but he went through tribulation is it okay son was saved but they have to cut his head he went through tribulation is everybody okay is everybody okay let's change this again everybody okay you have not kept the commandment of the lord your god which he commanded you for now would the lord have established your kingdom upon israel forever but now your kingdom shall not continue the lord has sought him a man after his own and the lord has commanded him to be captain over his people because you have not kept that which the lord commanded you so the tearing of the lord is a time of disqualification everybody okay so far everybody okay so far they're telling of the lord is a time that displays the weaknesses [Music] let's go to matthew 24 lord help me it's heavy traffic is heavy amen if you dare you can say amen matthew 24 44 you there i told you to be with your scripture don't come in this church without your bible please because i don't want to be responsible if you come without your bible that's your own blood amen verse 44 therefore be you also ready for in such an hour as you think not everybody okay the son of man cometh when you don't expect it amen anybody okay who then is a faithful brother kelly and a what in which way what kind of servant wise servant who is a white servant a white servant comer whom his lord has made ruler over his household to give them meat in water so a wise servant amen is a servant that gives the people spiritual food in this season [Music] you didn't get me a wise pastor must feed the flock with the word of the season everybody okay verse 46 blessed is that servant whom he's lord when he comes shall find so doing doing what giving the spiritual food in this season verse 47 verily i said to you that he shall make him rule over all his goods everybody okay watch now but but what if that evil servant shall say in his heart my lord delaying of the lord is an opportunity for him [Music] everybody okay he delays his coming and shall begin to do water he's smiling because of the tearing of the lord as the lord terry his character begin to show up he can hold only for so many days but after a while it will burst up everybody okay they can believe the message for a while after a while they can't hold it anymore it is god that is delaying to let all that need to be disqualified come out amen do you follow me watch what you're doing when god is delaying it is the delay of god bringing you close to god oh it's giving you more opportunity for foolishness everybody okay everybody okay he says and then he begin to smite his fellow servant and to eat and to drink with the dragon everybody okay the lord of the servants shall come in the day when he looks not for him like so and in an hour that he's not aware of anybody here and shall cut him asunder everybody okay and appoint him his portion with the who everybody here the hypocrite there shall be water and water in the tribulation period [Music] the delay of the lord is a time to disqualify to let the first oil run out this man was a servant of the lord but he was just evil to be displayed as evil the lord have to tarry to show the true color of soul the lord have to tarry amen the tearing of the lord is also an opportunity to open the resurrection [Music] go to john chapter 11 you are home you say i'm going to go quick amen john chapter 11. john chapter 11 verse 1. you there everybody there now a shortened man was sick everybody okay now do you want me to continue you want me to continue oh you already got it you want me to continue now a certain man was sick named lazarus of bethany the town of mary and her sister marta and it was that mary was anointed it was that mary which anointed the lord with ointment and wiped his feet with her hair whose brother lazarus was sick therefore his sister sent to him saying lord behold he whom you love so they have to put a special code to speed jesus if they say he's sick remember you love him so when they say you love him if jesus is working or he's eating a hamburger hamburger he dropped the hamburger he got to the flight he's going straight so they put something there remember the one that you love is right here in other words you need to leave everything you're doing and come right now emergency that's how you read the scripture everybody okay verse four when jesus heard that you think oh my god lazarus is dead where is the ticket it costs ten thousand dollars i'm gonna pay for it this is an expensive time because it's summer i don't care i need to go that's what you think jesus will do because he loves lazarus let's see what jesus died when jesus heard that he says this sickness is not to death but for the water the glory of god that the son of god might be water thereby now jesus loved not only lazarus but he loved marta and her sister and lazarus so this is not a simple family this is a family that have a first class in jesus a vip family everybody okay verse 6 when he heard therefore that he was sick he ran quickly to the airport he aborted two days still in the same place where he was the disciple look they say fix yourself we need to go why lazarus is sick you know him and lazarus body you know what i'm saying oh yes i understand so we need to go they find jesus are we leaving going away no sit down they told you lazarus is sick sit down everybody here the situation is getting bad bad they just call back they say he's now we not see you everybody here jesus said sit down it is now hopeless the doctor said they are giving out sit down the tearing of the lord the tearing of the lord the tearing of the lord just make sure he loves you if he loves you the tearing of him is a greater miracle that is coming up in the future but here when you ask him something and he's staring and he's staring abraham he's telling he's staring the miracle gets bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger towards the bigger promises amen i have been asking for this is that it looks at the lord don't hear me no make sure he loves you if he loves you don't worry he's waiting for his strategic point to strike once for amen amen these egyptians that you see here you shall never see them everybody okay can i continue blessed be the name of the lord job to verse 11 these things say he and after that he said to them our friend lazarus is water who told him who told him but ago you going now that a man awake him out of sleep then say the disappear lord if he sleep he shall do well he was sick he's still in the hospital so maybe they put him in the regular room he's no more in icu he said no he's in the casket over there they already took him off life support anybody here however jesus spoke of this death but they thought he had spoken of taking rest in water jump to verse 21 then say martyr to jesus lord if you have been there here when we call you in that way you can only act when somebody is still breathing when it's not breathing you came but it's too late jesus said okay you knew me with the first oil according to the festival i only work when somebody is alive but i'm going to show you a different oil that even if the situation is dead everybody okay everybody okay even when it seems like it's finished son of man can this burn you even everybody okay he says but i know that even now whatsoever you will ask god god will give it to you jesus said to her your brother shall rise again the tearing of the lord unfolded a power of resurrection i'm going slowly verse 24 mata says to him and now that he shall rise again in the at the water so he put jesus off yesterday if you were here and he put jesus in the future i know you're gonna do that but he forgot jesus in the present time but is the same yesterday today and what he can do in the future he can do it today what he did yesterday he can do it today what do you do today he can do it tomorrow [Music] anybody okay jesus said verse 25 to her i am the water and he that believeth in me though ye were dead he shall do what he took the tearing of the lord to unfold the power of resurrection the tearing of the lord unfold the disqualification he unfold the true character of the people who is foolish and who is wise and the tearing of the lord unfold the power of resurrection brother bonham says this help me lord hallelujah he says the same voice that's simon john say the same voice that said to john in the rapture is the same voice that shall summon the church someday [Music] i'm going somewhere also the same voice that summoned john to come up is the same voice that summon dead who out of the water that same voice of the water [Applause] because at the voice of the archangel everybody okay christ [Music] anybody come on ease the water that's why brother branham said my care was crashed everybody here everybody here they tearing off the lord and fought the device of the academy which is the voice of resurrection in other words the second one is connected with the rapture it is connected with the resurrection you cannot have resurrection without the second oil because the lord tell me he's staring is to disqualify somebody to show the color of other people but it's also telling you i'm coming for the resurrection anybody here because jesus cried with her loud voice amen at midnight there was a cry when the angel came down put one foot he cried everybody okay everybody okay everybody okay the message is yummy friend amen the crust is the voice of the voice of thee that trumpet voice of christ summoned john to come up the same voice simon did you not he said the grave of lazarus he spoke with her in revelation 10 he spoke with her telling you the resurrection is back again [Music] you want to resurrect if something ever happened to you get connected to this message [Music] so when he called you will answer everybody okay he said he summoned him from there he said lazarus brother brother say not just lazarus comfort lazarus comes off amen the first thing is ascending the first thing is a shout and then a voice second thessalonians and then the shout is a messenger getting the people brother branham say also that the shout is the message and here he said the sound is a messenger but the messenger in his messenger everybody okay and brother bottom say the second is the voice of water the same voice the loud voice in saint john 11 which we read 38 44 that call who from there getting the bread together then to be water so the second oil the tearing off the bread group is for this all to run out when this oil run out it's gonna show the color of people it's gonna disqualify some other people about here but it's gonna also unfold a different oil that is connected with the resurrection and the rapture everybody okay glory to god amen we know that christ is the wisdom of god amen because the wise version have wisdom and the wisdom is connected to the oil and that word we found out he was crushed and the wisdom of god is in a mystery [Music] i don't know if i'm going to get where i want to get lord help me paul say that we speak in other words we preach the wisdom of god which is christ in air so you don't preach christ any kind away let's go slowly what kind of mystery in a hidden wisdom even what god which god ordered before the word for hour so when you preach jesus christ you don't just preach him like jesus christ you need to preach him in a mystery but not an open mystery a hidden mystery relax in romans 16 verse 25 paul says this he says to him that is of power to establish you according to you know what it means in this church let's stop ask the denomination who's not preaching jesus christ they're talking about jesus they're preaching jesus they're preaching the cross they're preaching this they're preaching this but paul say when i preach jesus christ this is the way i preach jesus christ i preach jesus christ come on accordingly everybody okay everybody okay nothing he can oh jesus jesus jesus jesus you don't see jesus just like that even the magician can say jesus but here ever here you preaching jesus according to the revelation of the witch mystery do you see why in this message we're in the mess that we have [Music] you he's just preaching mystery he need to get down to people's life we preach the tabernacle he didn't get in your life he didn't get in your life you didn't see your life but you saw it in a mystery [Music] when we preached the level we saw that it's baptism when we preach the president okay we saw now that it's the cross we are preaching christ in the revelation after what does he do to your life you begin to put your life back in order but here you begin to go home and you're thinking about the sermon you wake up you thinking about the sermon why you didn't do that before [Music] he's preaching mysteries preaching mysteries what is mystery crust is the mystery [Music] the seventh time they unfold the water the mystery and the voice of the seven engine there so what do you want i'm not gonna preach a pentecostal gospel i'm not preaching to jesus gospel well we gotta pump you every day and tell you about your prosperity god is gonna bless you those people hate you then we see then we see how god bless you and living like dev also according to the revelation of god which was what what sees the water paul say that's the way he preaches that's why brother branham say i preach like [Music] you understand today so brother branham is telling you when i preach christ i don't preach him in the air which class are you preaching which jesus are you preaching let's go back to the bible which bible when you went back to the bible look at the life of the people everybody okay anybody okay everybody okay that's why brother branham say jesus his name on earth was redeemer jesus when he was on earth he was there that's true but when he conquered death and what and overcame them he ascended and we see the water jesus jesus jesus you don't get nothing because there is a new name [Music] [Applause] [Music] relax my friend relax my friend if the lord terry i will preach to you the new name of jesus in this church and you will see it very simple amen very simple when i say that somebody's saying oh so jesus i have a new name i will show you everybody here ever here and i'm gonna get in the temple and pull that name from the temple and it's in the scripture [Music] but here brother branham say because they miss that new name now they are hollering they don't get nowhere because they don't preach jesus correctly you gotta preach jesus with the new name amen that name will be revealed in death [Music] how can you preach that name without the tandem [Music] what is the thunders give me the quote where the name is written it is not what people thought amen he said he is coming there's got to be something to change you know that there got to be water he have to be more than the first oil because we have this oil we cannot go to the rapture something else must come that will change the people until we're going to live this earth and meet jesus in the air amen everybody hold on with your question and answer it's a whole sermon i have to go one part one part two part three and you see the new name of god everybody okay brother bottom say nothing shall be saved only those whose name were put in the lamp's book of life before the foundation of the world jew or what that's all the book of redemption holds there and that book is only unfolding it what we're preaching christ's inner not each one's name but what the mystery of the book is while it's calling those yes let me help you up again the book does not say now revere is to be saved in the church ages or all maneuver in other words the book of redemption doesn't have the name your father and your mother gave you you are maybe some of you got the name they gave you from the bible but you can have the name from the bible and go to hell they can call you abraham you go drinking and smoking and die you go to hell like with abraham everybody okay everybody okay the book of redemption doesn't say that if you are abraham there was already another abraham how many abraham do we have so who's abraham is it is he the original abraham or the abraham from africa or the abraham in asia or the abraham is in america the book doesn't say that what does the book say then brother branham say no he don't say that he just shows there unfold there of what there but we ourself bye we do what so your name your name is written in mystery do you follow me that's why when they preach the mystery you feel in your heart somebody waking up and say wow wow wow that is your name [Music] everybody okay so if we don't preach the mystery how are you going to heal your name [Applause] how are you going to heal your name because god will not call you he said church charles hamilton ah the devil will heal that the seventh seal is silence [Music] when god comes brother chose understand god [Music] [Applause] [Music] when people are leaving this message when people don't want to deal with the message what keep you in the message what do you hear in the message [Applause] [Music] brother branham said the sweetest sound that a human can hear is the sound of his own name [Applause] my name my son bad but when they call me [Music] everybody here i am here ever here what do you hear [Music] [Music] we preach christ not christ like that we put christ in a mystery [Music] amen amen let me see where i am we good my friend everybody here so don't come and say let's preach jesus christ they need to preach that what is jesus christ who is jesus christ how are you preaching that jesus christ is he just saying jesus there was a man called about jesus in the scripture did he give people eternal life because his name was about jesus he said i come to manifest the name of my father [Applause] everybody here jesus went to the pharisee they look at jesus they say be elsa but when jesus went to the woman everywhere when he's speaking that woman is hearing something different ever here when he unfold the mysteries the pharisees say to be eligible but when he afford the mystery that you have five husbands there's one you living with the sixties night also that woman didn't get mad she didn't say don't pray with me amen can i help you can i help you did jesus cast any devil in that woman who removed the devil who removed the devil did you see jesus say satan you who have hold this woman banned for years live yes did you see jesus doing that when the woman said i perceive that you are a prophet that name is removing devils [Applause] [Music] you hear a sermon and the sermon is changing you without you seeing how the devil is going away because you are hearing your name [Music] [Applause] when i will preach the rest of the church because we are still in the rest of god then we need to go back to the rest of israel then the rest of the church i will show you how do you hear with the scripture and the message of the hour but here jesus never cast the devil who stopped that prostitution because the jews were casting out devil jesus said your children are casting a devil why they didn't cast devil in that woman jesus said i am i am he said when the messiah cometh jesus said do you see me i am the messiah and the woman dropped the bucket and that was the end of the trouble [Music] [Applause] can i go further which altar did she go which altered did she go you seen her in the hotel crying the people don't even understand the message that they receive amen amen that's why you heard brother branham say there is no higher order that god have them to reveal his word because when he revealed that when you heard that that roman centurion say hey you don't have to lay hand on me go even come to my home just that's all everybody here when he spoke the word did he spoke the word in the same place the person was sick so how did that person many mouths got sick here you have brothers overseas in africa you are here in america when you call them on the telephone when you say hello does it take two to two weeks for your hello to be there when you say hello what happened there they hear you also hello why you are far away when you speak you are like you speaking close everybody okay everybody okay so we preach christ not jesus jesus did what problem say why that's why they holler and the life don't change the pentecostal keep getting washed that's right it looks like they can't put they can't stop they keep messing up because they don't know what is the name of god everybody okay we found out that according to this this oil here and the all of the candlestick are the same because they're using the same part but our main thing is in the second oil everybody okay now in the second oil according to leviticus the candlestick have to be refilled by the priest if the candlestick goes out who is responsible for the candlestick the priest for the lineage of aaron so if the candlestick goes out whose fault is it you ready you ready you ready and you recall the priest is the office of the son of god if you keep up with sermon you're going to be okay anybody care because the prophet is the son of man anybody here and we found out that samuel son of man we found out that samuel was not a priest he was a prophet but he operated first like a priest they gave him an effort but he was not delivered he worked as a leaver but he was not delivered at the beginning of his ministry he's going to be like a leaver he have to work with the candlestick [Music] did you get me if you didn't raise your hand when samuel normally the way he should operate was directly as a prophet everybody here but when they bring him to the temple his prophetic office was quiet he could not operate he have to follow the priest when he wake up in the morning he goes he say ila good morning what should i do and illa say you take this you take this put the oil and do this so he's operating with the light of the priest but he's not really the priest everybody here anybody okay at the beginning he have to operate as a priest at the beginning brother branham have to operate as any other preacher preaching divine healing preaching miracle and ever but that's not really his office at the beginning he must use the oil from the candlestick but that was not his ministry his ministry was the second oil but he must start with the other hole he must pick up the pentecostal oil [Music] and when he pick up the pentecostal he has campaign he has healing services he goes to the full gospel he was operating as a priest but that was not his office that's why brother branham said not the years of preparation not the years i operated as a priest but when i begin to sound the mystery when the seals are open [Music] are we okay now are we okay now jesus christ the bible says minister unto the lord before who and the word of the lord was very precious means he was rare in those days there was water there was no open vision but the prophet was there in other words the prophetic office didn't kick on yet everybody okay what happened the bible says this that and it came to pass at that time when ela was laid down in his place and his eyes got dim his eyes goddamn is that what the bible say okay every word in the scripture is pharaoh his eyes begin they didn't get them they began to watch what that he could not samuel was not totally blind ela was not totally black the way we think we think that ela was blind no his eyes begin to get dim so he cannot see clearly if you look at another translation he said illah could not see clearly he was not completely blind he was he was just his eyes begin to get messed up everybody here when the eye of the priest begin to go out anybody here his eyes begin to go out something happened in the tabernacle everybody okay anybody okay everybody okay maybe not brought the world the oil and he was going to the candlestick but because he cannot see well this is the candlestick he poured the oil here and he goes he said we put oil in the candlestick and then he sat down do you follow me and finally the candlestick went out am i reading a different bubble [Music] [Laughter] over here because the air the lamp of the god did what who had the responsibility to put oil but if the lamp went out what happened to the priest he was not water he was not pouring all that's why the lamp did what when the bridegroom terry what happened to all the lamp everybody okay everybody okay everybody okay so when the lamp went out god now came to speak to samuel the prophetic office open up which a prophet is a light but a different light it is a human light because jesus said john the baptist was a light everybody okay everybody okay so when that eye whine out in other words the prophet the priest i were not completely blind everybody the priest was almost blind ever here and the light of the lord went out everybody here and when he went out another office the prophet kicked in and god turned and began to speak to the prophet like i'm done with the priesthood i cannot cooperate with eli anymore now i'm dealing with the prophet then he begin to call samuel samuel they're going out of the lamp brother problem saying when the lord showed the churches in the sky there were seven churches anybody here everybody here seven why the problem when he described it he said at the beginning it was like this then it was like this right then it came like this then in tertiary and almost everything then over here the light began to come out then over here but in laodicea what happened everybody okay and brother branham took his pain and opened another light to you and leave everything here what and the bible say that laodicea is blind [Music] [Applause] do you know that do you know that when laodicea goes totally blind kicking out christ out of the church the prophetic office open do you follow me do you follow me what is that blindness is now this year like brother problem says this they were blind that is a bad way to be i don't think these christians were so blind as they was nearsighted let me continue he said i believe they were water brother brother say the blindness of laodicea doesn't mean that they were totally blind the blindness of elah doesn't mean that elah was totally blind brother branham said their blindness was near sighted near-sighted means they cannot see far away if you need a coach you see me i have three of them anybody okay near near-sided means if they want to read something they have to bring the staff closer like this everybody okay it is called myopia but here they cannot see far away but here they can only see things that are closer to the eye you okay they can only see things that are closer to the surface you didn't get me they cannot see deep everybody okay everybody okay [Music] they only think the only thing they could look at was their big building only thing they could look at was their big congregation only thing they can look at is how well carnage choir with all these big robes and things i think they were just near sudden they could not see over there so they can't see beyond what they told them amen i don't think they were blind they were just nearsighted all they could see was there well you know what we belong to so and so their big denomination their big crowd many members they sunday school they found me they cannot see past that layer everybody okay so far let me help you up again brother brother come on what i'm saying you are blind and what now this is a really desperate how can anyone be blind and naked and not knowing it yet he says that they were blind and naked and cannot the answer is they were spiritually and spiritually do you remember when elisha followed me carefully and giazi was surrendered by the army of the syrian you recall that elijah smote them water by the water that blindness was blindness to specific things everybody okay when elijah smoked them blind it didn't mean that they were all going like this no elisha came to them and spoke to them and said good morning guys what do you want they say we are looking for elijah but it's elijah talking to them and then i shall say you're looking for elisha they say yes sir he said let me come let me lead you to elisha and elisha is leading them toward the city but it's a larger that they're looking for so their blindness was not to the city their blindness was not to the highway they were blinded to a larger [Music] [Applause] their eyes were what and they could see where they were so it's not your kind of blindness but here in other words god got in their perception and remove the id of elisha [Music] so they can see elisha they would never know that italian even if you give them the birthday the birth certificate you give them the passport you give them the the the id from dmv they look like this they will tell you he doesn't look like it [Music] because in them the decoding of elijah is removed do you get me this is what i'm trying to say their blindness was peculiar in that they could see certain things but all the certain things such as ander and the camp of israel they could not what this army couldn't what this army could see did not avail for them in other words whatever they are seeing was not helping them do you follow me but what they did not see what was hidden from them that's what brought them to what the one they could not recognize is the one that put them in the trap but everybody that word do you get what i'm saying you get what i'm saying it is a blindness that blinds you to the messenger [Music] amen but here you are with felicia you are talking with elisha but you don't know this is elisha and the russia can take you and put you in a trap but here so what you see doesn't help you but what is hidden if you only recognize the hidden path then you will say wait a minute this is elijah again [Music] so that blindness is blindness to the hidden things [Music] under god let's make it clear in mark chapter 8 verse 22 the bible says that and he become to bedside jesus and they bring him a water we okay unto him and besought him to do what good and he took the blind man by the hand and led him out of the town and when he had spit on his eyes this is your savior this is your savior you see now come on now amen it's insane jesus did it you see now and if it's brother banana brother mary branham you see what i'm saying he said and he spit in his eyes and put his hand upon him and asked him if he saw what in other words jesus touched him when he touched him he finish what do you see there is a first touch everybody okay do you pick up do you pick up did you pick up what do you see in the first stage in the first anointing of christ what do you see when his anointing touch you what do you see he says and he look up and say i see what as water stop if he can recognize men i don't know so probably he was not born blind [Music] everybody okay everybody okay probably he was not born grand because he can say i see men he see men as what so he knew the difference between a man and a tree anybody okay anybody okay but this touch is giving confusion am i reading a different bible if you have a problem open your scripture when he look at the human being they look like what when he look at tree so they look like what everybody okay everybody okay so this man even though he can see he doesn't see clearly everybody okay even though i can see anybody okay he cannot see clearly everybody okay everybody okay and then what happened i see men are street doing what after that he put his hand what which time which time you have not caught it yet which time we tried what does it do to the young man everybody okay everybody okay everybody okay so when he touched the second time and made him to do what what happened to his eyes and he can see what how [Music] 20 20. everybody here everybody here so the blindness of ira was not totally blind when the blindness goes like bringing confusion it is a time for another touch everybody okay everybody okay so the first blindness with the first under the first touch under the first anointing of jesus he anointed him with his saliva everybody okay after that anointing is coming from his word everybody here you remember the sword coming from the mouth when he anointed him the first anointing he could see but he was confusing between a human being and what let me say it again it was confusion between human being and every word in the bible is waiting for uh what are you saying pastor when you take the bible you got it and you give to this man under the first touch when he read in the garden of eden there was a tree do you follow me do you follow me when he sees tree he only see a tree [Music] because there were two trees in the garden of eden they were the tree of life who can give people life who give people life [Music] who can give somebody life show me that tree when i go i would say tree give me life what is that chewy [Music] that tree is water the tree of life is a tree that you go to it it's gonna give you life by you own life who can give people life was he really a tree he was there [Music] he was a person that your life was a person but under the first anointing you can tell them it's a person they only see a tree [Applause] do you follow me you follow me you can say the tree of life was not a natural tree he was crushed when they look they see men they see jesus christ but they see him walking as a tree and when they draw they're gonna draw you a tree with an apple [Applause] [Music] they need the second touch when you open up when you see you say no it is not a tree it was jesus christ [Applause] because i come that the sheep might have life and they can have it abundantly i am their way i am the truth and i am what [Music] everybody okay when that blind must kick him the prophetic anointing open i don't know when i'm gonna preach the beast [Music] everybody okay everybody okay i'm already past my time we have to call this another title again everybody okay everybody okay we saw that when the candlestick were put up they were put as a rainbow looking up and it was only half the rainbow because the correct original rainbow of god is a circle everybody here and then they were only a rainbow and a half anybody care that's when paul say oh god help me paul say we know how we prophesy how we are under the candlestick ever here but when that which is what this is part [Music] this is what perfect or complete when that which is perfect is come that which is what part is what because the perfect contender part everybody okay this is your part amen the perfect is like easy when that which is perfect come that which is part is gone away because we already have what the part and we have the missing part it's the missing part that makes everything it is this one is open this one is amen so when the seals open it tells you that what happened we have now though [Music] then whatever was part that's why we don't read luther we don't read wesley we don't read the messenger anymore because everything is now put back in order everybody okay and then when it's done away plus say for i am jealous of you with godly water are you the husband why are you jealous it's somebody else's wife everybody okay and he said for i have what paul didn't say i marry you i have water amen amen because it was not the time of marriage everybody here i have despised you in other words paul i have started with you with all which oil and because of this because of this i have inspired you to one husband that i may present you as a what everybody okay to who which is the husband but i do what why do you feel what do you feel what do you feel i feel less by what ask them you see when i started the sermon you see when i started the sermon now as the serpent did what through water the serpent in the garden of eden was water in other words power when he started the church he was afraid afraid of what amen his fear bring to remember us what happened in eden [Music] amen are we okay now are we connecting everything now paul is saying i'm afraid but for you to understand why i'm afraid you need to go back to eden everybody okay now he says why because so your mind should be what from the water that is in who what is simplicity brother branham you okay preach a message god let's go slowly god let's go slowly god does two things number one he does what he hides everybody care and he does what how everybody okay so simplicity is the way god hides everybody here and reveal everybody okay and paul is saying not just the simplicity but the simplicity that is where in christ there is a way that god hides and god reveals himself and i'm afraid you will go away from that that's why paul say when i preach jesus christ i preach him by the revelation of the mystery i don't want you to get away from that way of preaching [Music] because when you preach jesus christ according to the revelation of the mysteries you will tell them you will show to the people how god hides and how he does what everybody okay that's why paul could take the book of hebrew and get into the levitical priesthood and put jesus christ out of it and say he was the holy place he means this the lamb means christ the high priest means this he was the high priest under my kisser he was going into the law where christ was hidden and he took christ from there and paul opened christ and gave it to the people he said when you want to preach christ you must preach him the way he and the way he does what [Music] but i'm afraid you're gonna get away from this because when you get away from this kind of preaching this is what he does you ready if da if he that cometh preaches what so jesus can be another jesus [Music] so when you say jesus i need to know which jesus you say because there is another jesus that's why brother branham said when they holler they don't get nothing because they're preaching another jesus are we preaching even in the rank of the message [Music] what are we preaching ever here if one cometh preaches water whom we [Music] so paul preach jesus those people preach also jesus but that jesus is different than the jesus of paul but the two names are jesus because the way paul preached jesus he preached jesus in the mystery amen amen if you receive another what which you have not so to jesus to spirit another water two gospels which you have matter he might well bear him i'm afraid paul how can you be afraid the bible says uh brother branham say what opportunity we have we have opportunity that simple never dream of ever we have opportunity that enoch elijah and all of them never had the opportunity we have what are those opportunities let me head to the airport i can't get to the service brother branham say the second watcher according to what we read in the book of genesis god created man adam was alone no help made for him everybody okay god looked he took adam he put him to sleep which we understand through the story of lazarus putting somebody to sleep for christian is death everybody okay they put adam to sleep when they put adam to sleep god went and pierced the side of adam and opened and pulled a rib eye back here and took the rib and make a woman as soon as he made the woman genesis chapter he made a woman bring her put the ceremony marry them as soon as he married them anybody here the serpent comes adam never knew eve because both of them the scriptures say they watch one another but they were not ashamed they were ashamed after everybody okay everybody okay now now when jesus came who is the second adam god took jesus to the cross we okay now and put jesus to sleep and peace the son of jesus christ everybody okay and bring water and bring one and that's what the bread came out of it amen and prayer came when paul looked at the bread he said which side this bread comes they say he comes from the side of the second adam paul say ah i'm afraid because i remember in either but here when that happened in eden there was somebody the serpent that came and he filed this eve what are you saying he said the second eve watch her she was created anew like he was at the day of water filled with water there's fresh soil the candlestick begins to burn anybody okay the church started on the day of pentecost anybody okay thank god and fed by the water amen that first church that first eve which was to be crushed brad because paul didn't perform the marriage he was to be he only espoused them how many can say a man to that she was to be that's why paul say i just put you as a fiance i need to present you amen she was born at pentecost not in nazia she was born on the day of water she was peer where she was spirit-filled she was spirit-filled the word fed every word that proceeded out of the mouth of god oh they just had to take everything just word by word a real blooming plant on god's earth representing him in other water everything looked perfect in the blood god took paul and said paul when paul came paul say according to the grace of god which is given to me as a what [Music] not a foolish one master builder i have done water so beside the outpouring of the holy spirit paul came and took the foundation and laid in other words he reinforced the church i laid the foundation and another build of their own but let every man take water why paul the church have the holy ghost you lay the foundation why are you afraid but paul is afraid he said lest every man let every man take heed how he does what for other foundation can no man lead that is led which is who now you understand which jesus is talking not just jesus jesus jesus jesus according to the what revelation of the mystery so if paul the church started with the holy ghost if the church you placed the foundation why are you afraid why are you afraid let me leave you with this then we're going to pick up because i don't want to wiggle you the bible paul says this john says this you okay little children it is the was that the last time and as ye have heard that the antichrist shall what even so john detected something right at the beginning of the church he said hey wait a minute stop jumping around something is going on here paul say remember eden as soon as the brad was born the serpent is coming everybody okay even now there are many water so what seems to be blooming behind there the antichrist was there anybody okay whereby we know that it is there so paul john when he look he say antichrist if antichrist come so we must be the last time it must be the last stage so jesus is just about to come he didn't have the seals everybody here but here the seals are not open yet the antichrist started everybody here and he says they went out from us but they were not of water for if they had been of us i hope you understand there would no doubt have what disqualification time somebody is going out there is a reason why they have to go everybody here but they want out that they might be made what that they were not at all the separation must happen everybody here so now john begin to tell us that hey the antichrist is here we just received the baptism of the holy spirit the church is blooming wait a minute the antichrist is here so this is the last time because this antichrist is supposed to be coming at the last time okay paul says take heed therefore unto yourself and to all the flock over which the holy ghost has made you overseer to feed the church of god which he has purchased with his own he called the elders he began to talk to them he said be careful keep the church of the lord keep preaching to them the stuff from the holy ghost i'm gonna go they're gonna kill me in jerusalem for i know this that after my departure paul shall water the bride will not stay like this according to what happened in eden amen the story is going to be repeated again but i must go amen not sparing what also of your own [Music] within the garden not outside the garden within the garden amen shall water speaking water to draw away water therefore watch and do what that of the by the spaces of how many years i cease not to do water how many times with water so this a person who placed the foundation who saw the holy ghost coming down he's crying every night why are you crying paul and no something is happening why look at what happened in eden when the first adam had his wife the serpent came this is the second adam his wife open up amen the serpent is coming up let's finish with this take seconds thessalonians and we close here oh my god i don't know if we need to call this part one it's already part 28. let's go to second thessalonians and then we stop here second thessalonians chapter two verse one if you dare you can say amen you there now we beseech you brethren by the coming of our lord jesus christ and by our gathering together into whom we're talking about the coming of the lord and the gathering together in him the bridegroom is coming what is going on paul that you shall you'll be not soon shaken in mind or be trouble neither by spirit nor by word nor by leather as from us as the day of christ is water in other words john came he said wait a minute the antichrist is here so it's the last time john was not the messenger [Music] you okay paul who is the messenger comes he said let me stabilize the church he said brethren i heard that's all of you this is the end time this is the end time jesus is coming i want you to quieten your nerve a little bit okay i don't want you to get trouble because jesus would not come until until what watch verse 3 let no man deceive you by any means for that day we okay shall not come the coming of the lord jesus will not come auntie accept the calm water so if there is not a fall yet jesus won't come we okay now so paul as a prophet look at the church he said no don't be afraid what you see as a big move here it's gonna fall hey but here when you see it falling then begin to get prepared he's coming anybody here they will not come except they're falling away first and the man of sin keep that in mind for next sunday will be water so the man of sin is sealed everybody okay paul said that there is a man of sin he's not revealed yet john called him the antichrist but that man is not to reveal it he says it's not revealed the who the son of water who was the son of tradition was judah alive here judah was already dead buried already but why is the son of perdition back again [Music] you okay now you okay now who that son of perdition opposes and exalt himself above all that is called god or that is worship so that he as god sit in the temple of what it's a man of sin so it's a human being amen showing himself that he is water who is the human being that make himself god we're going sorry are we gonna go through eden and drop down like this everybody here remember you not that when i was yet with you i told you these things and now you know that what we fall death that he might be revealed in his water this is not the time of the seals there's no way i can tell you the detail you gotta wait for the end time amen for the mystery how are you gonna know him by mystery you need a revelation of the mystery to know this man so if you don't want the mysteries how are you going to know how to do how how to perceive that this is what they were talking about amen amen everybody that if eve knew the mystery she would not have fallen in fair because she didn't know the mystery they only preached to her by adam but she didn't have the mystery and paul is saying that our preaching part the mystery are still closed and because the mystery are closed a falling away will come there is a predicted form of the church it's predicted it's gonna fall because the seals are not revealed but you must wait at the end time when the city are gonna reveal then you're gonna handle everybody okay he says for the mystery of iniquity that's already he didn't say it will work it's already you see now it's already working because as soon as they created eve the serpent begin to work how are you doing eve good morning you doing okay whoa you're a new creature here in the garden of eden never seen you before yes i just got created i'm the wife of adam the mystery begin to do what everybody okay anybody okay jesus help me elevate you it's already work only he who lets relate to the holy spirit until he be taken out of the way that's the bride verse 8 and then shall that wicked one keep that word i wanted to get to this but i can't keep that word for next sunday and that wicked one be water so they must reveal the wicked one who is the wicked one you will see pray god for next sunday amen until the wicked one be revealed whom the lord shall do what with the spirit of his water and shall destroy with the brightness of his water you okay now even him who's coming is after the working of who keep that for next sunday with our power and water and water keep this and i'm gonna take you to the book of revelation and you're gonna see this clear amen with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that do what why because they receive not the water [Music] the love of water that they might be and for this cause god shall send them water that they shall believe the water why you don't believe a lie that they all may be them who believe not there but head pleasure in water finish here but we are bound [Music] to give thanks how many times to god for who why do you thank god for us present beloved of the lord why because god has from the chosen to water through the water after and believing of water that's why when they preach the mysteries something in you you cannot help it he bypassed your reasoning because you were predestinated for that truth when the truth is unfold something in you grasp it and pull it aside and you shall know the truth it is not the knowing of the end a knowing of the heart and the truths accept you that's why the woman of the world when she knew the truth the truth did water and who the son has set free is what let's stand remember there is a blindness amen this oil disqualifies us that by the tearing of the broad groom he also unfolded the time of the rapture because the resurrection is the end amen but there is a second oil that have been kept all along that have to be used only when the bridegroom is just about to come then you need the second hole not the first oil the church is built from pentecost everything fine but when paul look he say boy we're using the oil from the candlestick and remember what happened in eden i want you to keep this for next sunday it's between the beast and the woman amen there is an enmity between the beast and the woman not between the beast and eve everybody here and the woman and that woman has a seed and the serpent also have a seed and the two seed will continue to fight amen and when the bride of jesus christ who is the second adam open up paul luke he say my goodness the serpent is still there john call him the antichrist ever here the people said no no no no no we are in the last time the antichrist je paul said no no no before jesus come there must be a fall amen there must be a falling away and what happened is the man of sin will be revealed amen when it's revealed what is he gonna do you have to understand what happened in the eden so you can know what is going to happen to the church because history repeat itself amen god knew what is coming up amen because we were not created in glorified body we were created from the sod amen when you created from the sad it's a weaker vessel it's a by-product it's subject to fall so you need a reinforcement amen but god will bring something else that will make satan look and he say i thought i thought i was fighting a woman but he will find out that he was not a woman he was a man and a woman amen amen amen and you will understand the power of the message of parliament amen that it's not you fighting it's another man that's why you say who is this melchizedek what is this attraction in the mountain what is come who came who do we see in the sky who is on that picture what is going on the headship come what does it mean there is a purpose why he's coming amen let's pray heavenly father lord we are for we are thanking you father for your grace for your love and for your mercy and for everything you have been doing for us father thank you for unfolding your word to your children because now we can see not by the intellectual eyes but the eyes of the heart we can now understand what lord your prophet was speaking all along lord father thank you for this oil and thank you for your revelation that you have brought through this message because we could be hollering left and right and not even knowing the trust that we are allowed serving like paul who thought that he was serving you but he came to find that he was persecuting you until you ask him you say paul paul why do you persecute me and he thought he was doing you a service and come to find out he was attacking the very person of the almighty god lord may we go deeper than what we can see father may you remove every blindness spiritual from your children that is bringing confusion in the word until we cannot see clearly we can see men looking like trees and we like the detail and we like the precision and we lack the perception and how can we walk like you taught the pharisee that they were blind leaders of the blind and both of them will fall into the ditch but father you spoke in the edge of laodicea you say come and buy out of myself so that you can anoint your eyes so that you can see father that oil that you are bringing through this message to anoint our eyes lord that we must see the king and we can understand clearly like elijah todd russia that if you can see me going if you can understand this thing then it will be granted unto you father may you granted to this church and may you remember lord father their needs earthly speaking on this earth lord if they came with a certain need in their life maybe they struggle in the body maybe something lord father they're going through that they need a solution or an answer from thee father we pray lord that you minister unto them we thank you always for their patience lord for going an extra mile to give us time to unfold this lord may the holy spirit continue to minister to them and to unfold beyond what was preached this morning lord so that the inside teacher himself can grant them more strongly in the scripture and in the word of the hour we commit them unto the hand and pray for the young people as they will be making their way coming back that your blood protect them may you remove every spirit of accident every day for sickness but may you bring them here back safe and sound all the way to their respective place lord we humbly ask it and commit everything unto the hand in the name of jesus christ amen god bless you church we love you [Applause] yes thank you they shall walk and not fame [Music] teach me lord teach me lord to wait let's sing it one more time before we're dismissed yesterday that wait upon the lord shall renew their strength they shall mound up [Music] [Applause] [Music] they shall run and not be weary they shall walk and not fame teach me lord teach me lord to wait y'all can be dismissed as we sing it one more time oh they that wait upon the lord shall renew their strength they shall mound up with wings
