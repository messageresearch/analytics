[1:08:30] found that there is a special moon here
[1:08:33] but the light of the moon the light
[1:08:37] of the moon will be exactly
[1:08:40] like the light of the sun
[1:08:43] in other words when the sun gives its
[1:08:46] light
[1:08:47] you can see the difference between the
[1:08:49] light of the sun
[1:08:50] and the light of the moon because the
[1:08:52] moon is not too bright
[1:08:53] are you there but this moon here when it
[1:08:57] give
[1:08:57] its light if you look at that light it
[1:09:00] is exactly like the light of the sun
[1:09:04] are you there it looks like the sun
[1:09:07] but it is not the sun it is the moon
[1:09:10] and brother branham told us that the
[1:09:12] moon represented the church
[1:09:15] everybody there and the sun represented
[1:09:18] christ
[1:09:19] there will be a church that's the
[1:09:22] reflection of that church
[1:09:24] will be exactly like jesus christ
[1:09:28] and the only church the only bride
[1:09:31] the only church that can be exactly like
[1:09:34] the husband
[1:09:35] it must be the pride
[1:09:38] because the bride and the groomer
[1:09:42] prays the name of the lord the light of
[1:09:45] the moon
[1:09:45] shall be like the light of the sun and
[1:09:48] the light of the sun
[1:09:50] you following me the light of this moon
[1:09:54] is exactly like the light of the sun but
[1:09:57] the light of this sun
[1:09:59] that the moon is reflecting is a
[1:10:02] specific light
[1:10:04] hallelujah the light of the moon
[1:10:08] shall be as the light let me take my
[1:10:10] time
[1:10:11] we got to drop this are you there the
[1:10:14] light of the moon shall be like the
[1:10:16] light of the sun
[1:10:17] and the light of the sun shall be
[1:10:21] watered
[1:10:22] so this sun here is have
[1:10:26] a light that is unfold sevenfold
[1:10:31] are you there and the light of this
[1:10:34] church
[1:10:35] must be like the light of jesus christ
[1:10:38] are you there but this christ is
[1:10:41] seven-fold
[1:10:43] christ in other words the light of this
[1:10:46] church
[1:10:46] must be the light of seven christ
[1:10:53] you following me it is in your bible
[1:10:57] the message is in the bible amen
[1:11:01] as the light of what
[1:11:04] oh my god so this light not only is this
[1:11:08] sevenfold
[1:11:09] but it is as the light of seven days
[1:11:14] are you there so this church
[1:11:17] must reflect christ but the reflection
[1:11:21] of this christ
[1:11:23] must be like the christ of seven days
[1:11:27] first day you put it second day you
[1:11:30] added
[1:11:30] third day you added fourth day you added
[1:11:33] fifth day you added
[1:11:35] sixth day you added seventh day you
[1:11:38] added
[1:11:38] that fullness of seventh day is the
[1:11:42] light of this sun
[1:11:43] which is reflected by the moon
[1:11:51] the light of the sun the moon shall be
[1:11:53] like the light of the sun
[1:11:55] and the light of the sun shall be
[1:11:57] sevenfold
[1:11:58] amen as the light of seven
[1:12:01] days remember your days
[1:12:05] in the day that the lord bangs up the
[1:12:08] what
[1:12:09] did brother vanam preach a message the
[1:12:11] breach that's right
[1:12:13] amen hallelujah
[1:12:17] that shall burn up the what why did
[1:12:20] brother run and preach the bridge
[1:12:23] shall burn up the breach of his people
[1:12:26] and do what
[1:12:27] heal the stroke of their last scripture
[1:12:30] let's go to matthew 22 then we pray
[1:12:34] for those that don't know my style this
[1:12:36] is the way we operate
[1:12:39] amen
[1:12:44] matthew 22 verse 1
[1:12:49] i might have to skip for the sake of
[1:12:51] time let's go to verse 2.
[1:12:53] if you dare you can say amen the kingdom
[1:12:55] of heaven is like to a certain king
[1:12:58] which made a marriage for his son you
[1:13:01] understand now
[1:13:02] king marriage son esther king
[1:13:06] marriage you understand that and sent
[1:13:08] forth his servant
[1:13:10] to call them that were bidding to the
[1:13:12] wedding and they would
[1:13:14] not this was speaking about the jews
[1:13:17] everybody clear
[1:13:19] again he sent forth other servants
[1:13:21] saying tell them
[1:13:22] which are beaten behold i have prepared
[1:13:25] my dinner
[1:13:26] my oxen and my fatling are killed and
[1:13:29] all things are ready come to the what
[1:13:32] there is a call into the marriage
[1:13:36] but the one that were invited rejected
[1:13:39] the marriage
[1:13:41] are you there verse 5 but they made the
[1:13:44] light of
[1:13:44] it and went their ways in other words
[1:13:47] they paid no attention
[1:13:49] one to his farm another two is
[1:13:52] merchandise
[1:13:53] and the remnant took it his servant and
[1:13:55] intrigued
[1:13:56] them spitefully and sued them
[1:13:59] but when the king heard thereof he was
[1:14:02] angry
[1:14:03] and he sent forth his army titus the
[1:14:05] roman army
[1:14:06] and destroyed those murderers the jews
[1:14:09] and burn up their city the city of
[1:14:11] jerusalem we already explained this
[1:14:14] then say he to his servant he's not
[1:14:16] dealing with the jews anymore
[1:14:18] the wedding is what ready but there
[1:14:21] which were beaten were not
[1:14:23] worthy the jews are you there in other
[1:14:26] words that bride is not coming from
[1:14:27] there
[1:14:28] it's going to come out from somewhere go
[1:14:30] you therefore in the
[1:14:32] highways and as many as you
[1:14:35] shall find as many as the lord your god
[1:14:38] shall call
[1:14:39] you you get it you need to be reading
[1:14:42] your bible
[1:14:43] as many as you shall find beat them to
[1:14:46] what
[1:14:47] it's called to the marriage so the
[1:14:51] servant went out into the highways and
[1:14:54] gathered together all
[1:14:56] as many as they found both bad and good
[1:14:59] and the wording was furnished with what
[1:15:02] so in right here in this parable
[1:15:06] there is a marriage and there is a king
[1:15:08] they invited someone
[1:15:10] the person that were invited refused to
[1:15:13] come
[1:15:13] to the invitation of the king and
[1:15:16] because they refused to come
[1:15:19] the king divorced them and the king
[1:15:22] turned around outside and began to sit
[1:15:25] for
[1:15:26] new guests in other words they were
[1:15:29] calling guests to the marriage
[1:15:31] to seek for a new bride not the one we
[1:15:35] invited
[1:15:36] that were already qualified but those
[1:15:39] were pre-qualified
[1:15:41] and later on we found them they were not
[1:15:43] too worthy
[1:15:44] are you there but he found somebody else
[1:15:47] who was worthy
[1:15:48] who was outside in the byways and the
[1:15:50] highways everybody clear
[1:15:53] to come into the marriage of the lamb

[1:16:47] christ lord
[1:16:48] that you may minister to your brother
[1:16:50] this morning as we humbly ask you to
[1:16:52] commit everything
[1:16:53] unto the hand in the name of jesus
[1:16:55] christ
[1:16:56] amen everybody can hear me pretty good
[1:16:59] oh praise the name of the lord we are
[1:17:02] handling
[1:17:03] a subject this morning
[1:17:06] called the king ahazaris
[1:17:09] three fists and esther's
[1:17:13] two banquets everybody ready
[1:17:19] the king are serious three fists
[1:17:22] there are three fists that the king are
[1:17:25] serious made
[1:17:27] the third one was the feast of esther
[1:17:30] and there are two banquets that were
[1:17:32] prepared by esther
[1:17:34] we already explained those two banquets
[1:17:37] and in between those two banquets
[1:17:39] there is the revelation of the son of
[1:17:41] man everybody clear
[1:17:43] as we started to navigate in this
[1:17:47] subject
[1:17:48] i want you to remind to be reminded of
[1:17:50] this
[1:17:51] brother branham say in christ is the
[1:17:54] mystery of god with you
[1:17:56] he said the bible is written in
[1:17:59] mysteries by being in this church
[1:18:03] now you understand what it means in
[1:18:05] other words
[1:18:06] everything in the bible is in the form
[1:18:09] of
[1:18:09] a symbol and behind that symbol there is
[1:18:13] a meaning
[1:18:14] there is a message there is a specific
[1:18:18] instruction that god is trying to convey
[1:18:21] to his brother
[1:18:23] everybody clear the bible is written in
[1:18:26] mysteries
[1:18:27] jesus thanked the father for it see
[1:18:30] that he was wrote in mysteries
[1:18:33] in the stature of a perfect man brother
[1:18:36] branham said that
[1:18:37] the whole world is wrote in mysteries
[1:18:40] the entire bible
[1:18:42] and only and only the knowledge of god
[1:18:46] can reveal it amen that's why you need
[1:18:50] the message
[1:18:51] in order to unlock the bible for you
[1:18:54] because without the message the bible
[1:18:57] is a sealed book you need the message
[1:19:01] in order to understand what is the king
[1:19:04] trying to convey to you amendment
[1:19:07] brother branham continued in the
[1:19:09] exposition of the seven church ages
[1:19:12] he said but in mysteries if the bible
[1:19:15] is written in mysteries if the whole
[1:19:18] world
[1:19:18] is written in mysteries those mysteries
[1:19:22] require the teaching
[1:19:25] not the preaching the teaching
[1:19:28] of the spirit or
[1:19:32] it never becomes clear
[1:19:35] there are stuff you need to be taught
[1:19:39] if not you're not gonna get it everybody
[1:19:42] there
[1:19:43] how we need to hear from god
[1:19:47] and lay ourselves open and become
[1:19:50] yielded
[1:19:50] to the spirit to hear and know
[1:19:54] in other words the whole bible is
[1:19:57] written
[1:19:57] in mysteries you need to be taught
[1:20:00] those mysteries to decode the
[1:20:04] message that i look under symbols
[1:20:08] everybody clear brother branham said
[1:20:10] that god
[1:20:12] can in other word cannot give a first
[1:20:15] revelation then a second revelation
[1:20:19] if he did he will be changing his mind
[1:20:23] he can give a revelation and then
[1:20:27] add to it are you following me
[1:20:31] that's the reason why for the ministry
[1:20:33] of jesus christ
[1:20:35] we had so many scriptures for one person
[1:20:39] if you remember the ministry of john the
[1:20:41] baptist
[1:20:42] malachi spoke about john the baptist
[1:20:46] isaiah spoke about john the baptist
[1:20:49] god did not give two separate revelation
[1:20:53] he was only one revelation but the
[1:20:56] reason why he's giving more revelation
[1:20:59] is to give you more clue for you to
[1:21:02] catch that revelation
[1:21:04] when that revelation comes
[1:21:08] if they ask you a question who is your
[1:21:10] pastor
[1:21:11] you're gonna say my pastor is brother
[1:21:14] stephen
[1:21:16] there are many brothers that are called
[1:21:18] brother stephen
[1:21:20] the part is not enough
[1:21:24] if we bring five brothers stephen we put
[1:21:27] them here
[1:21:28] and somebody get there he said brother
[1:21:30] stephen
[1:21:32] all five brothers will rest you will
[1:21:35] have confusion
[1:21:37] to know which one is the pastor of this
[1:21:40] church but
[1:21:42] in order for god to help you understand
[1:21:45] who is the pastor god will send
[1:21:48] a second prophet the first prophet told
[1:21:52] you that
[1:21:52] the pastor of spoken word tabernacle
[1:21:56] is stephen when the second prophet comes
[1:21:59] he's gonna tell you that the pastor of
[1:22:02] spoken word tabernacle
[1:22:04] is tall when the third prophet comes
[1:22:10] he's gonna tell you that the pastor of
[1:22:12] spoken word tabernacle
[1:22:14] is an african-american when the fourth
[1:22:18] of prophet comes he's gonna tell you
[1:22:20] that that pastor wear glasses
[1:22:24] when the fifth one will come he's gonna
[1:22:26] tell you that that pastor
[1:22:28] was originally from the congo in africa
[1:22:31] are you there when you get all those
[1:22:34] five
[1:22:35] prophets together then you're gonna
[1:22:37] understand that your pastor is brother
[1:22:40] stephen
[1:22:40] he's tall he's an african-american and
[1:22:44] then he's originally from the congo
[1:22:46] he has a dark complexion you got the
[1:22:48] whole picture together
[1:22:50] so you won't miss it are you there so
[1:22:53] now when you enter into the room
[1:22:55] and you say brother stephen even though
[1:22:58] five stephen was up
[1:23:00] you have no detail to detect
[1:23:03] and to separate your pastor from the
[1:23:05] other pastor
[1:23:07] are you there so god give one revelation
[1:23:11] all those five prophecies all those five
[1:23:14] characteristics
[1:23:16] speak about one person but god add more
[1:23:20] revelation to help you understand
[1:23:23] and receive his revelation issue
[1:23:27] hallelujah he can give a revelation
[1:23:31] and then add to it as he did in the
[1:23:34] garden of eden
[1:23:35] when he promised the seed to the woman
[1:23:38] and then later on
[1:23:39] designated that seed had to come through
[1:23:42] abraham
[1:23:43] he's not changing the revelation he's
[1:23:47] just
[1:23:47] bringing that revelation more specific
[1:23:51] more focused so that the elect
[1:23:54] won't miss it are you there because the
[1:23:57] devil
[1:23:58] is the author of confusion
[1:24:02] president of the lord he said and that
[1:24:05] letter
[1:24:06] said it will come by the same bloodline
[1:24:09] in what but it was the
[1:24:12] same revelation he only gave the
[1:24:16] people more to help
[1:24:19] them do what and what
[1:24:22] is indeed a good god is he god more
[1:24:26] wonderful
[1:24:27] he doesn't want you to stumble he's
[1:24:30] gonna help you more
[1:24:31] like when thomas came he said if i don't
[1:24:35] put
[1:24:35] my finger into jesus i won't believe
[1:24:39] jesus said i need to do more extra work
[1:24:42] with thomas
[1:24:43] jesus appeared he said thomas where are
[1:24:46] you
[1:24:46] if for you to believe if for you to
[1:24:49] receive me
[1:24:50] if for you to understand me it takes you
[1:24:54] to put the finger
[1:24:55] go ahead and do it because thomas was
[1:24:58] predestinated
[1:25:00] and to predestinated people god will
[1:25:03] reach down
[1:25:04] right down and pull you to where you are
[1:25:08] are you there this is the god that we
[1:25:11] serve
[1:25:13] prayers the name of the lord we have
[1:25:15] been dealing with two women
[1:25:18] roof and oppa and to understand more
[1:25:22] orpah
[1:25:23] roof and uh and esther and to understand
[1:25:26] more roof we went to the book of esther
[1:25:29] to bring from the book of esther and
[1:25:32] understand
[1:25:32] better the line of judah now let's take
[1:25:36] esther
[1:25:37] chapter one we already left the airport
[1:25:43] hallelujah blessed be the name of the
[1:25:46] lord
[1:25:48] for those who read you're gonna see how
[1:25:51] easy it is to nag
[1:25:52] to navigate amen
[1:25:58] our captain our captain jesus christ is
[1:26:01] in this flight
[1:26:03] he is co-pilot brother steven is on a
[1:26:06] pulpit
[1:26:08] are you there amen esther
[1:26:12] chapter one everybody there
[1:26:15] okay verse one now we came to pass
[1:26:19] in the days of harshers
[1:26:22] this is a hazares which what
[1:26:26] rain they are talking about the dominion
[1:26:30] of hierarchies he has a kingdom
[1:26:34] he ran from india even to
[1:26:38] ethiopia
[1:26:41] we found out that the bible is speaking
[1:26:44] about a great kingdom
[1:26:46] of king harasseris and this
[1:26:50] hazardous the bible is more specific
[1:26:54] that his reign started from india
[1:26:58] all the way to ethiopia the bible did
[1:27:02] not say
[1:27:03] that his reign started from ethiopia
[1:27:06] to india are we okay
[1:27:11] the bible says that it starts from india
[1:27:15] to ethiopia if you look at those
[1:27:18] two you found out that india is far
[1:27:22] east everybody there and
[1:27:25] ethiopia is on the west side
[1:27:28] you following me so the dominion
[1:27:32] the reign of this king start from the
[1:27:35] east
[1:27:36] are you there and it moves on to the
[1:27:39] west
[1:27:40] are you there it is not a kingdom that
[1:27:43] started from the west
[1:27:44] going to the east because jesus christ
[1:27:47] says
[1:27:48] that as the lightning goes from there
[1:27:53] to the earth so shall be the coming of
[1:27:56] the earth
[1:27:57] so this kingdom started from east
[1:28:00] all the way to the hallelujah
[1:28:04] brother branham help me now civilization
[1:28:07] has traveled from water
[1:28:11] east to west and as the sun
[1:28:13] geographically rises
[1:28:15] it rises in the east and it travels
[1:28:19] westward and goes down in the west
[1:28:22] therefore let's look what the son
[1:28:27] did when he brought the what
[1:28:30] the gospel light at the beginning under
[1:28:33] what
[1:28:34] there was a pentecost and now pouring
[1:28:38] off the holy spirit
[1:28:40] son wanders miracle great thing
[1:28:43] taken place so brother branham is
[1:28:46] telling us here
[1:28:47] that civilization travels from the east
[1:28:50] to the west the sun travels from the
[1:28:54] east
[1:28:55] to the west and the gospel also
[1:28:58] the influence of the king also start
[1:29:02] from the east
[1:29:04] all the way to the west
[1:29:08] more geographically the sun rises on the

[1:42:07] healed them all
[1:42:08] and charged them that they should not
[1:42:10] make him known
[1:42:12] that he might be fulfilled which was
[1:42:14] spoken by isaiah the prophet saying
[1:42:16] behold my
[1:42:18] ever hear everybody clear so jesus was
[1:42:22] here

[1:42:48] god
[1:42:48] and now we found out his deity that
[1:42:52] brought him frankincense
[1:42:54] was attacked that he was a service to

[1:43:36] that the jews
[1:43:37] are the princes the jews are the servant
[1:43:41] and even jesus christ himself when he
[1:43:44] came
[1:43:45] because he chose to come as a jew he was
[1:43:48] called
[1:43:49] by isaiah the prophet the servant

[1:54:46] on a free moral agency for his own
[1:54:49] holiness and when he did that the man
[1:54:52] fell

[1:55:15] and charge the nation of israel in order
[1:55:19] through the fall of a man he can display
[1:55:22] his attribute because he has the riches
[1:55:25] of a savior

[1:55:33] a prosperity
[1:55:34] but nobody was poor so god called
[1:55:37] israel unto the feast and through that
[1:55:40] feast
[1:55:41] the purpose of the feast was for god
[1:55:44] to display his attribute are you there

[1:56:16] he had that to be to be a son he had
[1:56:19] that tribute to be a healer
[1:56:20] he has actually to be a savior see all
[1:56:23] these things
[1:56:24] had to display themselves and god to
[1:56:28] make a man sin
[1:56:29] so he could not punish him no he put him
[1:56:32] on the basis of a free moral agency
[1:56:34] and man sin himself and so therefore god
[1:56:38] became a savior so it's just only the
[1:56:41] attribute of god displaying themselves

[2:12:26] that's not the way you read your bible
[2:12:29] you look you say they therefore attack
[2:12:31] job

[2:12:35] tender mercy
[2:12:36] he is wonderful he is a deliverer he
[2:12:39] and matter of fact he blessed job more
[2:12:41] at the end
[2:12:42] than the beginning if i'm going through

[2:13:13] one time if you come under the same
[2:13:17] thing

[2:29:11] we okay peel us in there
[2:29:15] in the temple of god but what is the
[2:29:18] temple of god
[2:29:20] i love brother branham jesus spoke of
[2:29:22] his body
[2:29:23] as being the temple i just said it here
[2:29:26] the lord coming suddenly into his temple
[2:29:29] he was he was the temple of god but
[2:29:32] now we are a holy habitation you
[2:29:34] remember the scripture
[2:29:35] but now we are his the true church is
[2:29:39] death
[2:29:40] by the holy ghost within us
[2:29:44] now he's going to make the offer coming
[2:29:47] here
[2:29:48] in the temple but what is that
[2:29:52] don't you love the prophet
[2:29:56] the bible is written in mystery
[2:29:59] it takes the teaching of the spirit
[2:30:04] not the teaching of brother stephen of
[2:30:06] the spirit
[2:30:08] are you there a pillar is actually a
[2:30:11] part of the
[2:30:14] if the pillar is a part of the
[2:30:18] foundation
[2:30:19] that means that the floor must also be
[2:30:22] marble
[2:30:25] if it's not marble brother branham is
[2:30:26] wrong
[2:30:27] [Music]
[2:30:30] but watch the prophet not wrong
[2:30:33] are you there all right what is the pure
[2:30:36] a pillar is actually a part
[2:30:38] of the foundation for he holds up the
[2:30:41] superstructure
[2:30:42] are you there anybody there
[2:30:46] okay now when god puts a man
[2:30:49] in the temple as a pillar and makes him
[2:30:53] a part
[2:30:53] of that foundation group what is he
[2:30:56] doing
[2:30:59] there is a message always a message it
[2:31:02] symbols
[2:31:03] but behind symbol a message you need to
[2:31:06] decode it by the prophet
[2:31:09] are you there he is giving him
[2:31:12] a revelation of the word and of himself
[2:31:17] because that is exactly what the apostle
[2:31:20] and prophet had you understand now
[2:31:24] praise the name of the lord now we found
[2:31:27] out that these pillars were made of
[2:31:29] marble
[2:31:31] now every masterpiece is put on a
[2:31:34] foundation
[2:31:35] a sculpture angelo mica

[2:32:26] and pillars of marble there is a
[2:32:27] superstructure god giving you a
[2:32:30] revelation of himself
[2:32:31] just like the apostle because the church
[2:32:34] is built upon the foundation of apostle
[2:32:36] and prophet
[2:32:37] jesus christ himself being the chief
[2:32:39] cornerstone

[2:38:32] bat their heads together

[2:38:54] horse rather
[2:38:55] and this death is certain brother brown
[2:38:58] i'm sorry in a vision and mamba
[2:39:01] let's see how he called that mamba are
[2:39:04] you ready
[2:39:05] wake up by the bottom and i look at that
[2:39:08] serpent
[2:39:09] that member and then he started toward
[2:39:12] me
[2:39:12] and he couldn't do it yet and i say what
[2:39:20] the name of that member is called what
[2:39:23] the name of the pet horse where the
[2:39:24] death is called what
[2:39:28] in the name of the lord jesus christ
[2:39:30] abandoned
[2:39:32] and the serpent and what
[2:39:39] you okay now the life of the mamba
[2:39:42] is blue but it's under your feet
[2:39:47] are you there kick him out kick him
[2:39:51] out are you there a blue smoke flew out
[2:39:55] of him
[2:39:56] and he curled up and made the sound like
[2:39:58] a nest
[2:39:59] capital s made backwood like an enzyme
[2:40:03] blue smoke fell out of him and he still
[2:40:06] choked him up his own death
[2:40:08] lies chunky mother on self
[2:40:11] to death around his head paragraph 70.
[2:40:15] and i went over and did what
[2:40:19] remember that color is under your feet
[2:40:21] okay
[2:40:23] okay mashed on it now i've got to find
[2:40:27] out
[2:40:27] about this because it's a vision and hit
[2:40:30] on on the thing and it turned like that
[2:40:33] looked like a handle
[2:40:34] and a glass handle on a picture and just
[2:40:37] made a solid crystal
[2:40:39] and i say i think of that how quick
[2:40:42] that blue smoke was what
[2:40:45] and what left it all day
[2:40:50] so the life of a number
[2:40:53] have a blue color are you there
[2:40:56] and the number is your death which
[2:40:59] is certain in another form are you there
[2:41:03] so under the feast of the seven days
[2:41:07] the gospel is decorated to help you up
[2:41:11] but you are working on this earth the
[2:41:14] self
[2:41:14] which is infected with the devil are you
[2:41:17] there
[2:41:18] the church will go through some of us
[2:41:21] some of our peers went welcome to the
[2:41:25] white horse white collar somewhere
[2:41:28] walking
[2:41:29] on the red color some were working on
[2:41:32] the black color
[2:41:33] but we are working on the blue color
[2:41:36] which is the member you say he's a snake
[2:41:40] brother stephen
[2:41:41] elijah move that up take a look
[2:41:44] i'm trying to head to the to the airport
[2:41:47] because i can't get where i wanted to
[2:41:50] let's go to the book of luke hallelujah
[2:41:54] luke chapter 10 verse 19.
[2:41:58] amen luke chapter 10 verse 19.
[2:42:02] if you dare you can say amen
[2:42:06] everybody there
[2:42:10] this is what's before the death of jesus
[2:42:12] christ
[2:42:13] everybody there everybody there
[2:42:17] behold i give you what
[2:42:20] to do what on what
[2:42:24] he gave it to the church so we have
[2:42:27] power that's why when brother branham
[2:42:30] binded he went and did
[2:42:31] what mashed on him
[2:42:35] it is a power on your pavement
[2:42:38] you have a right to work on it
[2:42:43] are you there power
[2:42:47] to thread on the serpent scorpion
[2:42:50] that second seal that red color you
[2:42:53] remember
[2:42:53] the second seal the scorpion was deaf
[2:42:57] right death where is your sting the
[2:43:00] scorpion
[2:43:01] the second seal you remember go watch
[2:43:03] they are changing pattern of god if you
[2:43:05] forgot it
[2:43:06] right but there the scorpion and other
[2:43:09] because the scorpion symbolizes death by
[2:43:11] his things
[2:43:14] and then he says serpent mamba also
[2:43:16] symbolizes death
[2:43:17] serpent death scorpion death but you
[2:43:20] have given power to work over death
[2:43:22] are you there scorpion and over oh
[2:43:27] over what no let's go back
[2:43:32] scorpion come on and also what
[2:43:35] in other words your pavement have
[2:43:38] all colors of the devil and you are
[2:43:42] given
[2:43:42] power to work over all of them
[2:43:46] you can mask the white one you can match
[2:43:49] the red one
[2:43:50] you can match the the the the black one
[2:43:54] you can also match the man by himself
[2:43:57] are you there the power has been giving
[2:44:00] over
[2:44:00] all the power of who
[2:44:04] the enemy and what shall by what
[2:44:08] do what they are just callers
[2:44:13] that's why paul said death where is your
[2:44:17] grave where is y'all
[2:44:19] because bonus is not gonna do me
[2:44:22] anything
[2:44:23] it's only a vehicle taking me to the
[2:44:26] presence of who
[2:44:28] all those powers are there don't be
[2:44:31] scared about them
[2:44:32] they're not gonna hurt you you have been
[2:44:34] given power
[2:44:35] it's a pavement you can walk on all of
[2:44:38] them
[2:44:39] everybody clear let's go to esther then
[2:44:41] i head to the airport
[2:44:42] i can't get to the second to the
[2:44:44] two-fist
[2:44:46] amen i'm gonna hit something then we
[2:44:50] head to the airport
[2:44:52] because we need to get the third fist
[2:44:54] and the two banquet of estelle down the
[2:44:56] road
[2:44:57] you there and the pavement red
[2:45:01] and blue and white and black
[2:45:04] your full manifestation of the devil in
[2:45:06] the church ages and
[2:45:09] marble verse seven and they gave them
[2:45:13] what
[2:45:16] investors of what so this
[2:45:19] seven days prison
[2:45:22] is a fist of wine
[2:45:30] and brother branham told us that wine is
[2:45:33] the
[2:45:34] stimulation of the and it happened on
[2:45:37] the day of
[2:45:38] pentacles when the holy ghost
[2:45:41] come stimulate the church
[2:45:44] that was a wine from heaven
[2:45:47] showing that the seven feast is the
[2:45:50] dispersion
[2:45:52] where the holy ghost is given
[2:45:55] to the churches called the dispensation
[2:45:59] of the son of god
[2:46:01] the fist of wine to their
[2:46:05] gender to all their people for seven
[2:46:08] days are we okay now
[2:46:11] verse seven and they gave them drink in
[2:46:14] vessels of gold
[2:46:15] deity what the vessels being what
[2:46:25] they called all the people they were
[2:46:28] what
[2:46:29] and small when we read second chronicle
[2:46:32] in the temple we found that they were
[2:46:34] vessels that were great and what look
[2:46:38] right here
[2:46:38] he said the vessels were diverse
[2:46:43] one from what and uh
[2:46:47] not the earthly one the royal one
[2:46:51] the royal one in what it is the
[2:46:54] outpouring of the holy spirit in
[2:46:56] abundance
[2:46:58] to the gentiles but the vessels
[2:47:01] are diverse form in other words sister
[2:47:06] l'oreal vessels
[2:47:07] is going to be different than sister
[2:47:09] bridgenet vessels
[2:47:10] since the bridge and investors is going
[2:47:13] to be different than sister
[2:47:14] zadie's vessels even though sister
[2:47:17] bridgenet
[2:47:18] is the mother of sister zadie yet the
[2:47:21] vessels
[2:47:22] are different because under the jedi
[2:47:25] god deal with you individually
[2:47:29] that's why the vessels are different
[2:47:32] that's why david said here is my cup and
[2:47:35] i lift it up
[2:47:36] anoint my cup and my cup run over
[2:47:39] the cup of density is different than the
[2:47:41] other cup
[2:47:42] your cup is different than my cups
[2:47:45] because we
[2:47:45] under the gentile god deal with us
[2:47:48] differently but the holy spirit is in
[2:47:52] abundance
[2:47:57] blessed be the name of the lord and
[2:48:00] royal one
[2:48:02] in abundance according to the state of
[2:48:04] what
[2:48:06] job to verse 8 and the drinking
[2:48:11] was according to what oh my god
[2:48:16] none did what in other words there is no
[2:48:20] restriction you drink on the holy ghost
[2:48:24] until you are drunk are you there
[2:48:29] if one cup of the holy ghost make you
[2:48:31] drunk

[2:48:36] leave me alone
[2:48:37] let me drink until i am drunk are you

[2:48:45] life
[2:48:46] fill yourself with the holy spirit let
[2:48:49] me be
[2:48:49] feel according to my measure because he
[2:48:53] gave the holy spirit in
[2:48:55] nature are you there it is the love of
[2:48:58] the king
[2:49:00] no one compel one another don't be

[2:49:12] give them according to what
[2:49:16] hallelujah verse 8 and the drinking was
[2:49:20] according
[2:49:20] to the law none did what
[2:49:24] foresaw the king had appointed to all
[2:49:27] the officers of his house
