[Applause] the devil is a liar he's been trying to fight in ways that are unusual from the times before and as brother steven's been preaching you need to watch out for his tactics and so tonight i have decided to defy the devil and whatever was trying to work against the holy spirit that i believe i have and i'm gonna sing for his glory as not for show is for his glory to let him know that i appreciate him keeping me and molding me and creating me to be the woman of god that he has intended so i'm just gonna sing this for his glory um i love you lord [Music] and i lived my voice [Music] [Music] oh my soul rejoice and take joy my keys [Music] let it be a sweet sweet it's out in your ear church i want you to sing it like you mean it onto him [Music] [Music] i live this voice to worship

you're going through a fight [Music] you don't sit down and then start crying [Music] anybody care when you feel like you can't praise him that's the best time to even praise him amen hallelujah the devil is fighting left and right left and right but i know why he's upset because things has been unfolded but we're not backing up we're going to get into the holiest amen blessed be the name of the lord you keep remembering brother michael daley and sister bridgenet in their trip in uh in jamaica for the funeral so i have not heard anything about uh his mother yet but once he come back by god's grace we will know what's going on amen everybody okay with soul and obedience everybody got it clearly is it difficult to enter the holiest this gospel is not complicated it's very easy total obedience just a total obedience to christ will bring you into christ just do what he tells you to do that's all amen you do what he tells you to do turn go to the priest you just turn you start going to the priest then your leprosy is gone amen easy as it can be amen it's not complicated so if you were expecting a big formula to get into the holiest it's not too big amen so you keep praying for me i know the devil is fighting left and right especially when i am trying to get into the holiest the book of roof it's a special book you just hit one chapter and he opened the whole sermon just one word one word in the book of just one and then rook then everything open and then when i try to look into it it keeps unfolding just one word this is chapter three verse one just rather that's it it's a problem amen so you pray for me i need time i need to sit i need to search and then be under the holy spirit to kind of glean what he's trying to bring because this gotta be as clear as it can be there is no way the new birth can be complicated i believe at this stage everybody should know where you are whether you are in the other court whether you are in a holy place whether you are in the holy somehow you must know where you are and if you know where you are you're not there yet do not stop do not get discouraged it's time to wake up and just start moving and moving whatever needs to be cleaned up clean it up take it away don't wait for god to come down and then remove it no you do your part and let god handle his part amen amen oh my god blessed be the name of the lord tonight brother kelly is the one preaching it has been a while now we're back to the home folks amen so they've been soaking soaking soaking now it's time for them to start explosion again amen so you know brother kelly you pull on the gift of the lord and lord willing we will be blessed tonight god knows what you're going through god knows exactly what is tomorrow there is nothing that is surprising god brother branham says sometimes his nose they know of god the no of god are better than his yeses amen and when you look later on you will find out that i praise god this happened probably that was not the right i was supposed to be taking i should have gone a different route amen so keep pressing on the battle everything is okay everything will be on time nobody is going to be late we're not going to lose the rapture the rupture belongs to us if you talk about the rupture you cannot talk the rap about the rapture without me if you talk if somebody is telling you the rapture without brother stephen tell him it's wrong you need to put yourself like that you cannot i will send you elijah that was me that's why you cannot separate me from elijah did you get that there is no way you can separate me from elijah the prophet because elijah the prophet was sent because of me [Music] so that scripture is brother brother in me so how can you remove me from brother branham you see you see if you remove one you gotta remove another one but i know you cannot because it was written before even i was born because the bible says that before you were even forming a mother's womb god knew you amen and he already ordained you to be a prophet god knew everything god knew we're going to be in this church nothing is surprising him amen so don't worry all is well let's sing only believe oh lee believe only believed all things are possible on me [Music] me hallelujah hallelujah with an atmosphere like this anything can happen someone's needing their salvation you will see receive your salvation tonight someone that's needing healing tonight you will receive your healing tonight honey huh this i tell you with an atmosphere like this whoa we thank the lord what he's been ministering to us is that right we thank the holy spirit for what he's been given the pastor and the minister and brothers that's been coming through god richly blessed them but you know what he couldn't have sent him by but he had to set the stage and the audience first is that right no one can come unless the father draw them so he had to send it by for his precious bride hallelujah our hearts and mind the clear let us pray lord god we thank you for your grace your mercy lord jesus we thank you father for another opportunity to just come before your precious children lord god bless the pastor the family the deacons the laity lord god all the gifted ones father all your ministers that's on the battlefield in the last days lord god for your name's sake for your kingdom lord god so we thank you lord god for each and every promise that you have promising fulfilled in this last day and we're looking for more to come lord jesus so we give you praise we give you honor we give you glory bless those that had a desire to be here lord god so we thank you for receiving the songs of zion i have your way lord god on tonight so we thank you father in jesus name we pray amen and amen i'll tell you you know you pray with me it's our second service today we just come from i'm telling brother steve we just come from the uh jail there we had a good time in the lord the lord richly blessed but it but it's always an honor because it's not about me it's about him coming down strengthening this vessel is that right i get myself out of the way you can have what you come looking for on this evening oh you pressed your way out tonight you look good too hallelujah let's go to luke i mean mark if i seem like i'm jumping back and forth in the message to be forgive me because we was done uh another inspiration earlier today but let the lord have his way uh mark 20 11 20 mark chapter 11 and verse i'll tell you what let's start at verse 21 21 and peter calling to the remembrance said unto him master behold the fig tree which thou curse is withered the way and jesus answers said unto them have faith in god for verily i say unto you that whosoever shall say unto this mountain be thou removed and be thou cast into the sea and shall not doubt in this heart see no doubt right now we're going higher tonight saints the holy spirit's going to take his side tonight we're getting ready to move into something there's something more we're already moving he says but he's but thou remove and be and cast out into the sea and shall not doubt in his heart but shall believe that those things which he he saith shall come to pass he shall have whatsoever he sayeth he's therefore i say unto you what things so ever you desire when ye pray believe that ye receive receive them and ye shall have them may the lord add a blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated we're gonna work with tonight what you say here's what you say you know the prophet of god work with this in perfect faith but you know we can't leave it just there so just bear with me and pray with me i know it's wednesday night by the grace of god but we're going to move into something here because this is perfect faith is that right because we've been hearing from god we thank the lord saints we're going to move and we're going to put it on back what the power and authority that god has given his bride in this age is that right some of people are going to be wondering what's going on in their lives because the true believer is going to their catching up hold up is what they say is what they pray is what they ask is that right and you shall receive them now the spoken word is coming to pass we won't be able to get into all this tonight we're going to just touch some things but we want to lay a foundation by the grace of god and let the holy spirit have his way so we know that faith here is showing us is based upon forgiveness is that right faith has to be based upon forgiveness if you've got an art in your heart then something's wrong you know what you know we was telling them today when we just left them over to jail we was working with the message was think right do right it'll turn out right you know you're telling me think right you do right it turned out right you see because you never see doing something wrong turn out will turn out right is that right but you see doing what's right it'll turn out right it will not turn out wrong is that right because the footsteps of the righteous is ordered of the lord so we're moving into something here so we know that the prophet of god talked about this perfect faith this perfect faith that god didn't talk brother robert i heard him sung the song about coming up that ladder that statute of that perfect man is that right that foundation of it was what faith is that right this thing is and we know in this hour here now you got to have this faith that's working by love is that right this love for the word that god has brought us back and is our here now in the beginning was the word the word was god the word was with god and the word was made flesh is that right so we're talking about walking doing what's right we're going to get in our message i'm just letting them have this way right now is that right we talking about we know that we're going into a trip somewhere to go fellowship some is going for different reasons they know and god know where they're going is that right uh oh but you better make sure the word of the lord he sees everything is that right and i pray some of you young men step it up i was there praying today is that right man you got you got some beautiful brides in this church ah i'm gonna tell you something huh let me get out there we're talking about truth be talking about what god is bringing us in this hour what the lord told us first over there in the song of solomon chapter four first she become your sister is that right how does she become your sister and then you have fellowship with her then she can become your bride is that right so you first you look upon the best is that right you got to look upon the best i remember when we came here and we had that wedding here the first wedding that we had here is that right i'ma tell you there's more in that wedding need to go back and look and see what god really did that was the first wedding now that's the way god wanted that wedding to be brought forth i had an opportunity to go back there and look at them when they was practicing and before they was practicing you know brother steve i saw the young boy's eye they were standing around in there and i know how the african applicants like to do it now when it comes to a wedding right and when the photo they come around and then and the fella he was just shaking just standing there shaking and he was standing up here and i was looking at it and he got around i said yeah right you think god gonna let you walk down that aisle when that wedding starts in this church here ain't no way is that right ah and it was coming around in there and they wanted to show off is that right but i'ma tell you something when that wedding came the first wedding came in here those young fellas that were standing around there shaking when they was up here during the practice but when the time the wedding came they came down the aisle like this the holy ghost came down in it he made sure he was going to come down there this is the first wedding he told you how the first wedding was going to be they humbled yourself they recognized they was in the presence of god the way they practiced it wasn't going to happen in the real wedding is that right now we're talking about some of y'all going looking for a husband think the holy ghost don't know i know you're going looking for a husband ain't nothing wrong with that nothing wrong with that but i'm gonna tell you something brother steve in that first wedding the holy ghost said god showed us the pattern of the first wedding is that right ah sister if a man wanted to come up to you and he decide he wants to marry you ah the holy ghost told us first thing said do he had the holy ghost he gave adam the holy ghost it's for somebody in here somebody's going to be approached you got to find out how does he have the holy ghost huh then the second thing you want to split the whole negotiation i'm gonna give him a job do you have a job huh he gave adam a job is that right adam was all over the land adam was in charge of the land he gave adam a job is that right huh so you see those two things and then they have to realize is he becoming quite the companionship he working in a companionship you and him become one is that right hallelujah let's give him a clap off and i don't know how we got on that huh but i know it's for somebody thank you jesus hallelujah because you got the word the word is protecting you is that right you are sent up under the word this is the holy ghost in the morning this is the holy ghost ministry in these end times is that right hallelujah thank you jesus he's talking about perfect faith this is a different type of faith that's a great faith see this kind of faith that you're talking about here we're going to read we're going to read some things from the prophet and we're gonna get into the scriptures but you have to understand this is the hour now brother steve i kept hearing the holy ghost said when he got in that legalistic in the work that we had to do and he said in that legalistic form he said you had to confess and then they had to believe is that right when their confession they believe in the word of god now we're standing on the word of god of promise that god has brought us in this hour in this day it's what you say you're just thinking it's what you believe now something comes and revealed it to you but there's certain things that you have to have for you to speak those words for you to believe those words it can be no condemnation in your heart you mean nothing in your heart against anyone that's why the lord i've been having the time in the dales ah i'm telling you huh i know that i had a desire to get back there and god opened that jail just for me is that right oh but it's certain people freeze brothers theme is shutting them free in their minds and setting them free in the spirit let me tell you the first time when i went in then when i first went in there i went to a blocker in the first block i went to brother steve the fellow was in there the first time they looked up and they said we had just been looking for someone not even a minute ago and we spoke it up and here you come and when he come through the door let me tell you what the lord was doing in there he got on there and the lord turned around the fellas was studying elijah ah he started elijah he said elijah he was supposed to become three times i said three times i said no no no no no my brother elijah's about to come five times he said five times i said yes sir he come in there i said he has to come and elijah hey russia john the baptist i said malachi 4 luke 17 30. revelations 10 7 revelations 19 now when they got around in there one man was sitting down there at the table and brother robert he said william branham ah tell me the seed ain't there god testified he sent me there god is the one god opened doors god turn the stones over to god be the glory perfect faith we're moving into something look what he says help me lord he said now perfect faith 8 25 63 those who's writing it down he says now the only thing we have to do i mean you have to do then is have faith in what you are you got to know who you are let me read these things here and back up he said first i wrote down the five things you have to know you got to have a clean conscience there's no condemnation to those that are in christ jesus walk not after the flesh but after the spirit then you have faith in work and what the words say you are then he said jesus understood his position must believe all the word [Music] keeps the commandments of god let me read this and you see help me lord he said now you have faith in what you what you are have faith in what the word says you are he says and jesus had faith in the word of god he said that said what he was it is written of me he said now didn't david speak of him in the 20 in the psalms where he said the lord is my shepherd see i shall not want david recognized him he says and the prophets and all of them speak of him and what did jesus say jesus recognized himself in the scriptures who he was jesus said i am the life i am the way i am the truth he said i am the i am he said now look he said also i am the tree of life from the garden of eden he says i'm all of these things and he knew with that perfect faith he says that he was the anointed messiah you have to recognize you are a believer you are a christian you are a believer these signs shall follow them that believe is that right we have testimony after testimony at the testimony if you catch a hold of that brazen altar and what the lord really did everything runs back to that cross is that right at the cross at the cross where i first saw the light and the burns of my heart rode away it was there by faith i received my sight and now i'm happy all the day uh-huh why because you have testimony testimony testimony you let no one change or take the joy of the lord from you saints let me keep reading huh said i wasn't going to tell nobody huh but i couldn't keep it to myself is that right when you sing that song is that right when jesus do something for you see it's just something about that gift that just ring down in your soul and it makes you go way back from the old time it goes down now you know i couldn't tell nobody i couldn't hold it to myself look at how foolish you look huh [Music] help me lord he said look he said he was anointed messiah that the spirit of god was upon him but see jesus knew he said the spirit of the lord is upon me he said he has anointed me to preach the gospel to open the eyes of the blind cast out devils heal the sick raise the dead why did he get the bride what did he give the believer these signs shall follow them that believe i say put your faith execute your faith let the holy ghost anoint that faith that god put in you before the foundation of the world this is the hour saints you know when you go in there you got them we going to meetings in there and they said bro steve i got decisions we got this many decisions we got that many decisions you know you're going in and they believe in all these decisions you know so they're saying this according to the denominational way but if you truly make a decision you truly repent then what are you going to do you're going to continue to move forth is that right after you move from justification sanctification baptism of the holy ghost into the holiness of the holy is that right now when you're moving down in there we're moving down into that adoption is that right we know who we are once you recognize you are the predestinated seed of god you are the royal priesthood of a royal generation now you have to move when you act like it is that right all the things you remember that slave that brother brandon talked about that when he was there he said now what about will be a slave a buyer and he wanted the owner and he wanted to purchase a slave is that right well he wanted to purchase the slave and he got there and he says uh i'd like to buy that one right there he said no he's not for sale he said why are you not for sale he said why he said does he eat eat different sweet different he said no uh he said well what's different about him he said well you know in africa his father was a king you know that and you know when they come in i was telling the inmates that when the officer come by i said you know that he don't turn around and cuss the officer out he don't rage about the officer he don't want to jump out at the office uh why does he turn around and he's saying yes sir i will do that okay yes sir thank you sir now what would he do but look at us if we are not a child of a king we are the sons and daughters of the king the almighty god do you believe it you teach them children you say their prayers that's your natural father but when you go down at night elijah you say what our father why because our origin is from heaven is that right we know where we come from we know where we going is that right so we can talk to our father that way by revelation they make a decision when you make a decision then you move to a serving and nothing moving us into the serving is that right sanctification and once you get into that sanctification you move into that position what god has

you do also a little while in the world see me no more yet you sh you shall because i'll be with you even where in you inside of you the holy ghost that's leading and guiding us into all truth the lord is bringing a word to set us free is that right somebody that was struck struggling with a spirit of iniquity huh somebody that's struggling with that spirit know what to do in spirit of idolatry worshiping things putting things above god is that right there was a couple demons still hiding in there brother steve but the holy ghost came in first samuel 15 he came in there sunday morning we saw the iniquity for years we saw this lagging stuff it's like you know to witchcraft is that right he said rebelliousness is like another witchcraft stubbornness is liking her to iniquity we saw that for years is that right but without malachite4 he came and showed us it was something hidden in there he had to have the words of a prophet and he coming down there and he said what was it it's not only that he said it was pride is that right and pride and popularity he unveiled another demon for us well man see when you're walking with jesus christ it is not popular he was too wise to make a mistake he was too righteous to do any wrong he wouldn't want to be like him the foxes has holes and the birds have nests the front and son of man had nowhere to rest is that right hallelujah does that believe what you're hearing southern spirit let me tell you about that demon is that right you know it is inequity you think man is telling you to do something man it's not telling you to do anything it's god god get the glory it's for the honor and praises of the lord is that right why god said all that i'll chase him then i chastise and i rebuke because of what i love you is that right i love you not because they hate you let me keep going help me lord he said now the father that dwelleth in you he's the one who does the speaking [Music] can you imagine god living inside of these old vessels huh god living inside of these vessels to the world we just look like another person but to god you're his son you're the tabernacle that he's dwelling in huh does thou believe it huh who have believed god report that and to whom have the arm of the lord been revealed to see when they got around in their brother steve you know why when they get up to the cross when they get up to the brazen all time you gotta run and like realize at the cross it was finished is that right whatever you struggling with is finished that's why i told you somebody needs salvation it was finished at the cross anybody needs deliverance it was finished at the cross anybody needed healing it was finished at the crossing everybody needed to stop with their temper it was finished at the cross anybody needed to get rid of pride it was finished at the cross anybody gonna get rid of iniquity it was finished at the crossing anybody need to get finished with lusting it was finished after crossing anybody get finished with overworking it was finished at the crossing anybody wanting the money got a money beaten on him it was finished at the cross at the cross at the cross by the shed blood not anyone's blood it was god's blood you were so valuable god came down it came down i couldn't send an anger at them it was god's blood hallelujah thank you jesus thank you lord thank you jesus hallelujah they're getting it you know this is what they're getting there some people think those inmates supposed to be locked up and they're getting what they deserve someone needs to be locked up you know what i tell them you're getting three hearts in the cockpit and you're getting three hots in the cot and god love you so much you're getting thus say the lord is that right there's no way i could come in and preach the same thing that those organizations is preaching is that right this is the end time message isn't that right i said let's go and set them free nothing's going to set you free but the truth and nobody but the truth so we have to realize in his hour here now we bring him into the knowledge of who they are is that right we tell them and you look at moses when moses was there is that right moses couldn't know this was then his mother knew he was going to be what a redeemer is that right come back and leave the people out of egypt but what happened man god hidden in simplicity who know the mind of god no one but when they got in there they always told moses he's sending his father and his mother fear not what this is the king is that right they fear not the king so what she did she send them down the road send them down to now is that right put them in the basket they anointed it right sealed it with the holy ghost with the inside and on the outside but our faith thought it was a faith that was working by love god he said lord god you've gave me this child here i'm sending them there in the now father i'm following your instructions lord jesus you showed me he was a proper child he showed you he was a proper child there he showed you he was a proper child there he showed you he was a proper child there so god provided way for leading them away why getting blessed say the lord in the end time your children you're the proper child now you look at him you move along is that right man you're coming out here now we train up a child in the way that he should go when he grow old he will not depart from it he may go to the left he may go to the right though but now he's seen what he's seeing the truth is that right remember the old rider when women little boy when the boy had to ride the bike and when the sizzy boy had to get there and they had to ride the bike and once he got there and they rode the bike uh he got over there and they said so whoever winner will win the prize is that right you want to know why you're and there's all this words you know why you're getting this anointing you know why god is coming in opening this word is because why he's just a boy he looked back and he got there and the other boys didn't win the race they fell off he wrote it all the way to the end and he wanted to know how to do it he said well boys let me tell you something he said i kept the eyes on christ but the main thing i watched when you made a mistake i watch with you be wrong you know he sat there for 12 years being faithful being obedient watching when he always was he realized god said i'm going to sit you down i want you to watch be obedient i'ma raise you up for something else moses mother he send them down there and when she send them down that knob is that right moses was going to be the deliverer but when you tell those inmates that moses grew up they have a commercial slightly ahead of your time by panasonic well moses got slightly ahead of his time is that right and when he got slightly ahead of his time but the word of prophecy still was going to be fulfilled in a word of prophecy god said he was going to send a kingsman redeemer out there with him is that right so moses brother when he got there pharaoh's daughter got him and after he got involved stevie turner she said we need someone to take care of them we need someone to raise them we need someone to bring them up in the way so who did god sending in huh he always had a ram in the bush he sent moses his mother is that right what are you going to do i could see him every day brother greg when he coming in and he was growing up he told his sister morale i can see you telling your children don't you never forget that when you go out there in the world god's got a purpose for you uh god's gonna use you moses you are not in egypt's emotion you are a hebrew moses always remember you tell your child there you are a son of god uh you want to be raised up by god's gonna use you and you raise children look up look up you god want to use you in the mighty way you're god's children you belong to god you're valuable to god more valuable than the blood thank you jesus hallelujah father dweller he says and it's not me it's the father that dwelleth in me he does the works see what i mean help me lord he said now he's then now the identification of the scripture christian you are a christian according to the scriptures the first antioch they called them christians you're christ like is that right now you got a title if you got a title and these signs shall follow them that belief is that right so whatever god is using you out there to do there was one day we go in and out of there that jail and it was one day we was working that night and we got there and you know it had a time when it was pushing just push tvs out the door come around there night when it was open 24 hours was right there walmart see sometimes you don't know what people do see in this generation here see i want nothing but oh what they call the lowest person on the totem pole clean toilets pull out trash sweep the floors do all these things is that right your brother kelly that's right you got to be humble to take a job like that you're at the bottom and we got there and they didn't realize i'm brother greg stripping wax floors pull up tile replace those things go out in the rain and things when you everyone else didn't have to go out there but you know at the time when the founder originally made that made that he says the most important job with the whole company the number one discount department store in the world he said it was maintenance he said because why do people come and repeat you have repeated customers because of the cleanliness of your store if you're riding down the road and you got your wife with you and you remember that place over there wasn't clean no honey let's go down a little farther we can't go to that one you see but we was there one night we was there and the fella come in there he said somebody was running out the front door with some electronics these signs shall follow them that believe the gospel wasn't preached so we got out there they told us not to go so far the uh past that poll if you did for our safety so when the father kept going he went out the door i said the lord see everything i said the lord see everything he turned he stopped he's a preacher you're the preacher huh he ain't bringing them goods back though you see he kept right on going but i'm saying the point is you don't know they never know who's going to see you is that right they never know and that same fellow that came through there he remembered me coming into the jail preaching the gospel to him is that right so we're telling you these things saints we had another one coming in some of them i'm telling you they're doing good all those not bad these signs shall follow them that believer if you believe that this gospel can set a man free then you would tell someone about the cross you would tell them about christ you would tell them how to truly repent because now a godless sorrow bring a godly repentance that he doesn't have to repent anymore brother steve i could go in them jails and then down and tell that man you know what he tell that man wait a minute brother you gotta go back to the praising of time you haven't repented the right way yet you gotta be truly sorry if you come there once you repent right the holy ghost will lead you the rest of the way is that what they have to do he's going to lead you he's going to guide you well it's not just some mysteries i hear him talking about all just the mysteries some of them talk about this some of them is truly appreciating it some of them catching what it really is what the lord is opening up to us every prophet in the scripture saw the plan of redemption for their time god has given us the revelation of the true plan of redemption if you don't get it right right at that altar if you don't get it right at that altar that's why you were struggling with certain things is that right huh i told him you can't get upset with you you don't like your nose huh you don't like your ears you don't like your lips you don't like your neck you don't like that what you getting upset for god don't make no mistakes god don't make no mistakes god made the best god made you he saw you before the foundation of the world get rid of that complex the real you is down in your soul is that right what the holy spirit is telling us that's why the holy spirit say in the legalistic way you gotta do it why because he's giving us what oh free more real you gotta be there imagination reasoning conscious affection these things are all free more will that's what the lord has given us in his hour that's why so many christians get thrown off and think they got the holy ghost and he's just giving you a spirit to deal with yourself you gotta move on in but god who's rich in mercy saved the best for last is that right he thought he had us drug users he thought he had us drug dealers he thought he had us homosexuals he thought he had these lesbians he thought he had you gamblers he thought he had the drinkers drinkers he thought he had his all these steelers these he thought he had liars he thought he had you uh um bound up with those demon forces but if you catch what happened at the cross at the cross and jesus said before the foundation of the rail he slew the land he was already we could not have been lost he just brought us that way saints god whose rich emotion already had a plan he said now look the identification is scripted christian these words say jesus these signs have followed them that belief now how can you call yourself a believer a people and deny those words be moving somewhere saints perfect faith if the prophet preached it then that mean is is reachable [Music] and it's time to come on and grab it isn't that right this is what he's moving us into perfect this is a faith that's working by love love is faith in sinneth it keeps them going so we have to see what the lord is bringing us in here for god so loved the world for you know my disciples they'll keep my commandments and they'll have love you for one another if someone come against you or someone saying something you love them you pray for them you make your love circle bigger is that right make it bigger saints he said now look he said because you're not a believer he said well you can see and deny any of these words you can you can't do it you're not a believer therefore signs can follow can't follow because just accept what you want you to believe and let the rest of it see that's all the holy spirit been been ministering take this part of the message thought i'd throw this i don't believe this part of the message take this part of the scriptures i don't believe this part of the scriptures huh let me keep going he says oh he says and when you truly believe not make believe but really believe then these signs shall follow them that belief oh could you compare it christian today with those christians he says now he he says i preached on the other night a prisoner you're a prisoner to the word of god he says he couldn't even move until god moved him a real servant of god cannot even move until the holy ghost tells them to move and then when the holy ghost tells them to move you can move is that right huh perfect faith joshua when he came in there god sent joshua on a mission he wasn't like saul is that right he sent joshua on a mission and joshua was on that mission i tell you what before i uh i'll say that go over to go to joshua one who just come to me you want to prosper don't work yourself to death trying to get out of there and we're running out there we know the gas prices and it's going up you know what i did you see i don't lost a knocks in my belt can you imagine me saving i'm giving up a meal every day huh huh i give up a meal every day if i give up a meal every day and then if i give up a meal every day that's something i can use is that right now i make sure i recycle everything is that right i keep my trash bags a little longer in the recycle go in the recycle bin is that right that's less trash bags i got to go huh you know y'all got that offer up on your phone you got offer up you want that offer up if you got offer up or put something on there every time they got an offer for you it could sound like a cash register don't they tinting running your phone you know that's all for us you have to find out ways to save money i'm trying to tell you that now is that right because we're coming to that part is that right god promised to take us god wisdom comes from god we want to show you something help me lord look what we said here i don't know how we got on that but for somebody joshua what you want to prospers look what he says joshua 1 1 he says after the death of moses the servant of the lord it came to pass that the lord spake unto joshua and the son of none moses minister saying moses my servant is dead now and therefore arise you go over this jordan is that right then the holy spirit said now what the servant of the day is gone brother brown is going it's going off of the scene now what is the anointing of what the holy spirit the christ spirit the christ anointing is back on the scene opening up his word with wisdom and knowledge and understanding he said that all the people let's drop down there in verse four he said for the wilderness this lebanon even unto the great river the rivers of euphrates and all the land and hit tyson to the great sea towards the going down of the sun shall be what be your coast you see that god gave him a promise he said there's he said there shall not anyone any man be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life come on saints he made a promise here young ladies children we get ready to show you is that right if you want this to happen you want this to be through your life look what he says he says and as i was with you moses so i will be with what thee i will not what fail thee nor forsake thee that's what brother brandon was telling them there about this perfect faith the perfect faith which is revealed to you faith is a revelation we will reveal to you it cannot fail is that right it cannot fail god's gonna do it at his time for his purpose for his glory for his praises is that right whatever you ask if you ask according to his will is that right you will receive it because it's not our will but let thy will be done is that right he said now look he said but do what he said be strong and of a good courage for unto these peoples shall thou divide for an inheritance the land which i shall unto their fathers to give them he said only be thou strong and very what courageous and thou mayest observe to do according to all the law which moses my servant commandment that's why we taking this scripture that's why we take the message we take the scriptures you take the message you take the scriptures and they both are what one is that right they can't deviate is that right they gotta be there but you gotta have what the holy ghost came down and showed us in the first seal was that right there in the second seal i was telling the fella every time i come in there brother steve he always come around there and go to the jail and he's sitting there you always got one you know that's going to be there that's why he locked up he got around in there he ain't humbling himself yet so we're coming in there trying to tell them the word of god he said well you know the trumpets done already don't pass you know we're just about getting out of that looking i said no brother yeah i said no you need to go get the seven seals the seven church ages you can get it free if you get it free brother then you get around in there and you're the only one that can get the books in a bible freight everything else in the world is a tablet nothing comes out from jeffersonville but but the books those books only go to the jails in prisons and institutions that's all they have those books for everything else you got to get a tablet is that right so that's why we're saying let them go don't mess with them is that right when paul say if it's still going out if they still pushing tapes if they're still playing it but the message is still going out they're still being flown is that right so we got their brother stephen his father he know he got the revelation of those uh seals and those uh uh trumpets is that right i said brother you gotta remember now and now god has done broader servant god said he bring nothing unless he revealed the first through his servant the prophet brother i'm telling you where to go to get it from so we got in there come back in again today brother steve yeah you know i was telling him about that trumpet i said you're wrong [Music] say i was crazy didn't you know that's how you got to deal with some hard-headed inmates that's something that's all they understand see then he looked at me then he sat there the whole time turned in his bible i still showed him grace i said brother you got to go over to revelation 6 and when you go over to revelation 6 then you got to go over to matthew 24 and then you go over to matthew 24 and then you could type those trumpets in right there brother do you understand what i'm saying but i love you brother anyway it's a total different ministry that's what it is it's totally different so you got to understand is that right you got to be fair friendly and firm when they come out there hallelujah he said now look he said this book of the law shall not depart as what not the power women let me back up help me lord he says be strong and be of good courage for unto this people shall thou divine for in what inheritance and which i swear unto thee their fathers he's only be strong and very courageous that thou mayest observe and to to do according to the law drop down to verse eight he said this book of the law shall not depart out of the mouth but thou shall what meditate therein day and what night that thou mayest observe to do what according to all that is written therein for then thou shalt make thy ways what prosperous obedient to the word and then thou shalt have what good success hallelujah he's giving you the word telling you have not i commanded thee say be strong and of good courage be not afraid neither be thou dismayed for the lord thy god is with thee we're what wheresoever thou goest the footsteps of the righteousness order of the lord let me go back here help me lord i'm back here my god chapter uh uh 72 i mean 773 help me lord he said now it's it's going to go back see all these things has to be restored back before we leave here it's going to be saints but the word has to come in don't let nobody tell you you ain't got to know these mysteries the seven seals is christ the son is still is christ it's christ's head back on the scene without the seventh angel hunting down bringing that seventh seal he had to fill every little gap is that right justification had to be sealed it was not filled in luther's day when sanctification has to be sealed it was not sealed in wesley day the restoration of the gift it had to come with the seventh angel is silly it was not fully sealed is that right people get upset when they come in there i'm telling you speaking this gospel you don't have to be afraid of this gospel we was in a meeting last sunday and we was there that's why parents you teach your children to be reverent when we got prayer in there train them up the right way we was at a place brother steve last sunday in the church service and when he got there and we was working with the message the guide you know everybody needed a guide and so when we come in there we know at the end we got many souls needed to be saved had to be about seven or eight i looked at them and they needed to be saved so once they got around there i asked them to close their eyes bow their heads and they get around there and brother steve when they came in they said who needed their salvation and they raised the hand god granted them thou said salvation as we spoke the word we know the holy ghost fell on them why by faith is that writing and wanting to know that i wanted to be sure that god sent me there he was a young man he was there and he was in prison for 15 years for shooting his best friend and i went to scene when i went to scene when he was in prison and i was telling the pastor and we were there and i pulled up in the town as soon as i pulled up into town my phone rang i said you must gonna live a long time i just got into town he said guess who i got here in the car with me he got around there i told i said brother i was praying for him last night and he was praying for him last night and god brought him into service that morning and when he brought him into service that morning i'm telling you a perfect faith that worketh by love when you come in there and you're moving there and god and your brother was there he god was richly blessing them in the service but after service we asked those who now needed the eternal life they had bowed their heads and when they bowed their heads and they came in some came up for the prayer line the one sister came up to the prayer line and when she came up to the prayer line the anointing was there and when we preached that message the guy then as he came in the pastor was standing there praying for him and when he got there praying for him that demon just got to go your ministers i'm telling you and that demon know he was in the presence of the lord he know he had to come on and that bended and he thrown down there and she fell down there she fell down on the floor and she fell down on the floor she just stopped i said jesus in the name of jesus come out of her in the name of jesus come out of her in the name of jesus come out of her and if you start the rule my wife and i witnessed that kind of demon in her grandmother one time she was sitting there in the room and a ball of saliva came out of her mouth that's what we're trying to tell you the children you got to know these things god is not just giving us so this is what the gospel produces you have to love him you have to know who you are you got to know who he's sending you to you got to know what he's sending you to do at a specific time and don't be afraid of the devil he said submit yourself to the word of god and the devil will flee from you that's what god said that's what the scripture is saying does it all in there and her sister came up easy just walking easy walking in his sister's name was comforter i'm telling you god moved in the midst under the anointing preaching the gospel see they always say they always resist this gospel the gospel just don't come in letter only it comes with power and demonstration it doesn't matter to me what people think i can care less what they think i know if god sent me somewhere god's going to take care of it joshua the spirit of joshua will tell him go wipe out the amulet kite don't leave nothing left behind when joshua you came in there joshua knew he got away from god be strong and be of encourage as i was with moses i'll be with you joshua came in he knew but joshua remember is that right joshua remember god sent him on that mission god don't have a way to do anything man joshua didn't want to call back on the lord he said what the what the holy spirit says speak speaker speaker speaker speak love speak jesus and your family speak jesus in the darkest time speak jesus in the lord speak jesus speak jesus i am not ashamed of the gospel of jesus christ hallelujah it's not just a song it's not just a song now you know why the anointing is here brother steve because when the singers came out when brother john and all the other ones came out and they were singing you know what they was doing hallelujah go to first go to first corinthians first corinthians 14. we see the scripture fulfilled right before your eyes first corinthians 14 help us lord he said now you look this is this this is not a show saints you're in the real war we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities and powers and wickedness and rulers in high places hallelujah look at corinthians look at verse 15. he said now look he says what is it then first corinthians 14 15. i will do what pray with the spirit i will do what pray with understanding also he said i will what sing with the spirit he says and i will sing with what understanding also it's the holy ghost that's doing it it's the holy ghost that's taking you over because you recognize i that i'm singing to the king i i'm saying to your savior i'm singing to our lord now we worship you we recognize you are the ones that die living you love me buying you save me bury you carry my fills all the way huh you come in here with a soul in your heart now brother john asking one of you to sing a song brother steve wants to get a revelation of the brass altar once they get a relation of calvary you'll recognize your position in the body of christ don't matter how good a person can preach no matter how good a person can teach you if that anointing ain't right when they come out there they got to fight through the devils that's still sitting there isn't that right huh you got to tell them you got to recognize come here when you made it here when you made it here tonight because you know that it was a rough week so far and that means you had to struggle to do or just say it was hard times i know satan is fighting hard right now people he's tagging his heart keep the past up in prayer we always keep him in prayer imagine right there huh think about if he wasn't sitting there god surely called me the pastor ain't going to rob the pastor he ain't got everybody else to pass stuff huh he's a gift that's sent by god god knows exactly what his people need when you come here you made it here and once you made it here you thank the lord is that right lord i i need a song now oh my heart is that right you come over here you know oh well i got a testimony yeah i'm hitting i'm home now huh we got a testimony let me tell you about what the lord did for me i tell you i did this this this this this don't take this this this this this brother but yeah i got a testimony brother for the glory of god i let me tell you what god did for me

help me lord he said look tell them about jesus the goodness of jesus is not just a song the value of the blood you are the value of the blood god's blood god's heritage you're saying now look keep the commandments he says hallelujah he said now he says for the word identify identified himself now look what we said the other who was he said keep keep his commandments is that right he said for the word identified identified himself what he was and the same word identifies us if a man loves me he keeps my commandments he says if he says he loved me and he keeps not my commandments he's a liar and the truth is not even in them it's over in john first john he said you say well you're right just an unbeliever that's all you're just an unbeliever if the bible said so that makes it right that settles it eternally what the bible said is the truth he said now look we are 75 we have chapter 75 he says now where he says to us if you abide in me and my word and you saint john if he in me see have faith in him ye abide in me and my words abide in you then ask what you will now see he knew he knew who he was you might be a mother of someone you might be concerned about your children huh but we don't worry about our children is that right we don't worry about those things we're racing his torment what statue can you add to your life none he said now notice notice there he says now he knew who he was therefore he had faith faith could produce when he knows what he was if you abide in me and my word in you then you know who you are that is again faith god you are the word you are written episcopal read upon all men god is building a character in you now to get you ready is that right for the second coming of the lord for us to get out of here is that right so we have to understand what the lord is bringing us to in this hour science make sure you're motivated objective you're traveling it's called fellowship fellowship with the lord is that right you don't have to worry about it some of you go in there and look at baby brother steve the bride gonna come looking for him i remember the prophet of god talked about the man that came from chicago ah huh but i'm

can never leave higher than yo [Music] you see what i'm saying you remember on sunday whatever you say mark the level you want to go if you want to go level 10 you got to say 10. then the holy spirit will pick you up and go up right there and move you in who told david he's going to kill goliath who told him he didn't have a vision when the occasion come he'll look he say i'm going to catch your head did it happen did it happen [Music] you have a powerful tool it's a mechanism it starts from the heart and he goes to the tongue and if you know how to use it properly you can change everything because even god created everything by his word go to psalm 45 then we let you go home let's go to psalm 45 what you say amen hallelujah you dead somebody already caught it probably my what why did he start with the heart because out of the abundance of the the mouth do what so the heart must be in abundance right and the bible says my heart is indicting a good mother so there is something good that is already filling my heart and overwhelming my heart that's the first that's where it started from your heart i told somebody i say why do you worry about something and someone's someone else doesn't let me help you do you have a few minutes do you have a few minutes why do you like a toyota and you don't like it nissan have you ever wonder why they can show you all the nissan they look good but something is in you in you doesn't match with the nissan why and even if they give you money you're not going to buy the nissan you will go straight to toyota why have you ever thought about it have you ever thought about it do you know why because toyota was in your package oh my god did you get what i'm saying so you were born with toyota in you i'm trying to get a simple example so you can understand amen you were born with it but you didn't know anybody here what you think is you that have oh like this toyota is good it is not it it's the true you that had toyota before the foundation of the world why have you seen somebody who doesn't want to live in the city do you know that and you meet somebody else who said no no no i cannot be in the country i have to be in the city why is one loving the city and another one doesn't like the city everybody here why is one loving it and another one said no no no if i want to leave i want to go there if i want and if you notice at the end toward their life down the road you will see them living exactly where they were saying why because you were born with this thing when you're born you have a package that package will unfold as life goes anybody care but when it unfold you think it's your memory it's not your memo it's not your brain it is something that was here that is it's like a flower that is coming up like a seed it's coming up that's why brother branham say whatever god leads your soul to believe it is yours do you know that quote you know that quote if you feel like a strong desire coming up all the time and pushing something it is exactly what belongs to you you just don't understand because you look at the circumstances you say me having something like that no and then after a while it kind of like bothers you you see it coming back up again it's just telling you it's me pick me up i don't know if you get what i'm saying why is orpah going back and roof doesn't go back what was in roof that made her go because there was something in the land of judah that was pulling for ruth and you think it's roof saying where you go i will go where are that it was not roof saying that it was the program that was already wired there when it's sun it's gone unfolded and before you know it it's moving amen i hope you caught it did you get what i'm saying there is no desire that rises up in your heart just like that especially not the brain i'm talking about the heart when it comes in your heart how many times have you felt something in your heart like go to the right and you go to the right and something happened why did it happen it's a package if you were born to be an entrepreneur you can't help it it's going to push you all the way there john sharit had an impediment of speech you know that and it was so bad that he can't even speak when he start he goes [Laughter] that was john charry and he prayed god he said i'm gonna get married how can i speak to a woman guess what he got married and guess what brother brandon pray for him and the impediment of speech went away everybody here do you know when he got his business his speech was still wrong when they gave him money to do the business he said no no me with like this i cannot do the business and he ended up me being a multimillionaire walking he was working on the street cutting concrete go read it go go tap john sharrod read the whole story and you will see what god can do he can take you from the dust and pull you up like this and put you somewhere anybody care who knew that boy shepherd that was over there was a king who knew they looked at gideon they say mighty men of allah is a good christian me or you talking to somebody else they say no we're talking to you me yes you were mighty men of valor already in package when times come when you feel it pushing up seize that opportunity don't doubt it just grab it you say why this distort god drop on me to do something like this go knock it you will see before you know it you will regret how many staff were popping up in your heart everybody here let's go to verse one my heart is in doubting a good mother i speak of the things which i have made touching her my my what is the offer so your tongue is a pen right what you say what you say verse two that are fairer than the children of men grace is poor into the lips therefore god has blessed thee forever what do you do girl that sword upon that eye almost mighty with that glory and their majesty and in their majesty ride prosperously because of truth and meekness and righteousness and that right hand shall teach thee terrible things what else are you afraid of you're not going to speak the word over there the devil won't be there the devil is here brother brother i'm saying we will use the higher civilization from there it is time to take your tongue and use it as a pen and set the mark of what you want what you say that's what god is waiting what you say that's it joshua never sat down and said lord jesus i'm praying no he just look at the sun he said wait a minute god sent me here to fight and this thing is going down he didn't think twice one day i would drop down and and and demonstrate the difference between the brain and the heart and you will see amen what happened in the heart always bypass the brain and it doesn't make sense and don't even expect that to make sense because the heart doesn't make sense the making sense is the brain so when you say it doesn't make sense it's the brain this one doesn't make sense this one operates differently who would have thought man can fly on a jet if you tell the people that were in 19 i don't know 17 or in the time of jesus christ there will be something picking up people and then driving with their miles and miles uh so many miles an hour who's gonna believe you but men tap into it and it happened amen so now if they tell you today you can travel like a thought look at what your brain is saying right now you you just heard your brain right saying no no no no this cannot happen but jesus crossed it feel it baptized somebody and they took him and put him in another city look at what your brain is doing right now as soon as i say that your brain is saying no no no no no no it cannot show me i'm like this going up and everything it's not going to happen that's exactly what it'd be faith always bypass the brain it's too complete total different channel amen don't wait for faith to make sense faith have only one sense it's called the sixth sense that's it he doesn't explain things the correct way you just believe how do you know it's going to happen i don't know just i feel like it's going to happen how i don't know oh my god may lord help us if we got time on this world we will sit down and show you what because when since your childhood the way the civilization is wired we were trained to train our brain more that's why we send children to school so every time you go there it's reasoning reasoning reasoning reasoning reasoning reasoning you go reasoning reason so when you graduate you're a doctor you're a phd in other way you are phd in reasoning when you sit down you analyze everything by reasoning no we need to do this then we do this then we do it because because from the childhood you were trained like that and the one who reason the better is considered considering the society the best then everybody is what in reasoning that is the way we were brought up now when faith comes it feels strange because faith is a different channel it's telling you you believe that you can jump here and go outside [Laughter] reasoning is pulling up because you are trained with it that's the problem but what god is doing he's breaking everything out that's why gas price is tight everything is tight everything is stuck so you begin to sit down and until all your options are gone god said good very good now now all your options are gone it looks like it's not gonna happen that's when god step in and when it happened you don't know how to explain it you just have to give a testimony and that's it oh no he was so and so who came and who signed the paper who sent so-and-so do you know how many people he refused to sign the paper why only you you can't explain that that's a different channel altogether so watch what you're saying watch what you're saying it's very easy you can say something and it happened you don't even know somebody told me was a testimony sister edie did you have a hard neighbor she's suffering like this brother john knows his story until one day she said she started she said lord jesus i'm tired of this neighbor i'm just paraphrasing can you send me a sweet old lady that can sit here and just taking care of her flowers and guess what happened she's ready after a while the neighbor left house empty for a while nobody moving in and before you know it somebody said sister hey you're going to have a good neighbor and what uh what a new neighbor it's going to be an old lady and before she even got there they already planted her flowers did you pray for it the jews fasted for it why did you say it and it happened where did that thought came to be specific that an old lady who planted flower and it happened like that that doesn't come here all you have to do spend your time meditating in a different channel throughout the world you're thinking about the lord you're thinking about the word and when something happened automatically you will see something rising up and saying exactly what need to be spoken at that situation then it's going to unlock the problem that's what it is it's not complicated is it complicated so if you're traveling they already told you what to do amen they already told you what to do whoever is traveling brother kelly was not with me but if you watch this serie of roof you will see naturally a lot of stuff there we apply it more spiritually but if you look you will understand ruth never went to israel for marriage i hope you're getting what i'm saying the purpose of her going to israel was not to get married because that option was already taken off naomi say there is no hope i don't have any child i don't have anything there's no hope if you follow me just know you go in here there's nothing to do so what she was pursuing was no longer about herself everybody okay she was living for naomi and brother branham say eternal life is living for others but here when she pursue eternal life as she's going down to the land of judah eternal life took care of everything did it make sense did it make sense ruth never was there and say whoa boaz and do everything to attract the boas she didn't even know she's going to meet boaz am i helping somebody never go there because you're trying to get boas boas don't come like that did i help somebody did i help somebody when you go there take your car and put it in neutral can i continue oh stop or i will continue on sunday everybody here when you put your car in neutral you don't put your foot on the pedal i'm letting it soak it makes noises still in neutral because you're becoming loud and when you loud you're scaring the fishes but it's uncovered you don't have to be loud you don't you have to push something to attract somebody you're wasting your time you're going to attract the wrong guy when boaz come he usually doesn't talk to you did i help somebody boaz will talk to the chief reaper first to inquire about the young lady that is in the field everybody okay let me leave it for sunday you will understand what i'm saying if i will be able to tell you on sunday when boaz come he would talk to brother john paul he said brother john paul how are you doing who is that lady over there then brother john porter will give a report and say yes this is sister sewing so she's a good sister she's a wonderful sister thank you then boaz move then when you come from the trip you bring you go back to naomi at home and you tell naomi what happened in the trip because naomi will ask you how was the trip going because naomi understands certain laws better than you and naomi will begin to decode from the what you're saying don't hide anything and then she will guide you how to move on did you get what i'm saying this is a secret talk that even on youtube you need to really follow to get what i'm saying anybody okay so far so don't get there and be loud did i help you don't get there and be like the women that was waiting for the men from chicago everybody the one who got married was the one that was laboring did that help you the one that was laboring the roof that was wood laboring that's the one that got married everybody else that fixed themselves up for something there they miss it because that man was looking for something else for character and the one that looked like she was not noticed she was so quiet you could not even see her you could even be on the room and never even notice that she was there that's the one that depict the louder one went home zero be loud in faith not in the mouth so don't get there and then everybody knows you okay when you get there everybody knows your brother brother brother brother until they show all a lot of noise it doesn't help they will see you like a joker you make everybody laugh all the time they laugh they're laughing before you know it everybody goes home and you stay there did that make sense anybody care so don't get there god bless you my brother god bless you my blaming so and so we five in a family we have the house we did this we did too much slow down slow down push the break god bless you god bless you how are you doing i'm doing good what's your name my name is so-and-so what's your name who's your pastor my pastor is brother stephen who is your pastor i'm just helping you and then channel them to the field push them to the field some are quick to the trigger before you know it no no no no no no you just seen an ear you don't know if it's a mountain lion or it's a really deer you should we talk about it buddy john [Laughter] the good news is all of them understand my language they already know what i'm saying you already got me right you know exactly what i'm talking about that's what i like about it so when you go there remember the advice of the younger men not to the older men but here so let's pray heavenly father lord we are approaching you humbly tonight father thanking you again for your grace for your love and for your mercy and for everything you have is blessing us father there is no way we can go into the rapture without the spoken word being manifested through your brother if everything we are seeing around [Music] are getting their place even the war that we thought was three days now it's lingering preparing the anger between the nation's father lord we know that something must happen also in the brother because everything goes together so you are working in a mysterious way in your brother and you are preparing us for the final showdown before we go home father i pray that you give up special revelation that the people realize who they are because it's very important the way things are rolling the way this economy is going the way lord father prices are going up it is so uncertain that a normal brain would have a hard time [Music] to keep up with everything that is going father it takes the supernatural realm of faith to override every pressure every depression every oppression everything that looks like there is no hope faith can pierce through all of them and still keep a chin up and still smiling in the midst of trial and keep progressing knowing lord father that you who began the good work will finish it until the day of jesus christ lord may you give strength to those that feel discouraged those that felt like whatever they were they were trying to do didn't work father may you give them a revelation to understand that the project and the plan that you have for your children it's always better and you know everything and everything is under control father i commit this oncoming trip down on the road i know it's coming up down the road but father exactly what i was thinking your servant brought them up tonight and lord you permitted it to come out now so somebody can get refocus to the purpose and the objective of what they're trying to go because there is a blessing somewhere and we don't want to miss it lord but we want it to be your way and we don't want the devil to step in and to upset anybody but we want everything to work together for good because your children need this lord father i commit them unto the hand may you continue to minister unto them and to grant it unto them special revelation day by day father as we are approaching the time that we will meet you into the air may you strengthen and touch the sick among us may you heal them lord and father as we're going home and tomorrow in our job may the blessing of abraham continue to be there we commit everything unto the hand and we humble ask it in the name of jesus christ amen brother john i'll say yes let's sing it one time i'll say yes yes i'll say [Music] yes yes yes [Applause] i'll say yes lord i'll say yes lord i'll say yes yes y'all are dismissed amen [Music]
