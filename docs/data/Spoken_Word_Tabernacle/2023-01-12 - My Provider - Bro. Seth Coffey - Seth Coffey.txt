the deity in the name of Jesus We Worship the Lord Jesus Christ we baptize in the name of Jesus Christ whatever we do in word indeed we do it in the name of Jesus Christ our family name is Jesus Christ and the message is Jesus Christ Glory Glory Hallelujah sincerely by burning down brother John amen amen amen amen everybody on board with body change glorification everything clear now if you have question go ahead and put it on the question box because next Saturday Lord's willing we have questioned and answer so you have questioned about the thunder coming of the Lord or something let them there because I am fully loaded I'm overflown so what I'm giving you here is just the surface so if you need more coat I can Lodge you Lord you until you get drunk with the stimulation of the revelation amen oh my the devil is really really really mad you need to leave with me to know what's going on amen I can't even touch my Bible five verses something is happening left and right just to get me away from the Bible and today the Lord helped me I could look at 15 minutes or so and he opened up more than an hour sermon I said therefore all I need is just few minutes amen amen so you pray for me we have a lot to cover I was trying to move forward but the boss is unloading so much about the word God as the word and God as the flesh now which he opened the scripture in a way I never said it before so I'm going to take you to my journey and we go left and right and you will see really and when I look at the message perfectly in line with the scripture so brother Brown a mixed statement sometimes you don't understand before you know it you see a description lining up together and the message comes right across it and you say what else is this message but Christ himself amen amen amen so remember he is the word he's the flesh Hallelujah now we're going to see again the word how he is what does he mean by the word and now you will understand why do we need the turtle why does the third pool have to come here so you pray for me he's already late because I already got the ammunition all I need is when I get those few scripture if I sit down then the quote begin to come and I I got the quote before I say okay this is what I have yesterday I added more today another so it's just keep coming keep coming keep coming so we're in good shape amen when you have something that you believe in you have to welcome every scripture did you get what I'm saying that's right believe something in this message every quote that they can bring to you have too much with what you believe you cannot have something you believe and you have quotes against that and quote for it that's the problem in the message this one goes into the one extreme and the other one found another stream no no no no no the perfect position in the message you need to sit where every coat matches your position if you're believing something and you run it from Genesis to Revelation and it's running together then you know you got the truth if you see something is blocking you need to make sure you fix that because it's going to come back to bite you that's right everybody okay everybody okay so make sure whatever you believe it's in the scripture and it's in the message and he cannot contract it I've seen things that are taught and when I see new quote they always back up what I already taught because you need if something is wrong go back again and reposition the church correctly everybody okay so I'm not preaching tonight its Brothers said coffee you know brother said you know brother said I usually tell them this is the second home amen so just like you can visit your family and then you go there you sit for vacation so when they come here they come in a little vacation so they're home I told them to preach like home you know him pull on the gift of the Lord what I like about them especially the new crop coming up they have Golden Heart they don't get into denomination when I say denomination I'm not talking about baptist I'm talking about denomination in the they don't get they just free in between as long as you stay that way God will continue to use it that's the Golden Heart everybody okay let's pull on the gift of God only believe oh [Applause] [Music] oh we believe all things are possible [Music] We Believe all the things [Music] say that we're very thankful to be here tonight in the presence once again you know there's something about being around the Sons and Daughters of almighty God I love it it's just a reunion when we get to come home together we get to worship our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ I want to thank brother Stephen for allowing me to have the opportunity to be here tonight I tell you he's a uh we know there's none good but God but he's a fine man tell you that I really enjoy every time we get to talk to one another and have fellowship with one another and you know I can just say this he's he's sure he he holds a standard I believe that with all my heart and I don't know about y'all but I appreciate him believing this message and and you know I tell you Church you really ought to appreciate your pastor for the time that he takes you know brother Abel's always telling me man he said I don't care what time I text this man he's going to get me the answer that I need and I tell you that's just a heart for the people so you know just remember to pray for him because I tell you I don't care how fine of a man he is there's times when it gets hard you know what uh if you could imagine if you uh probably shouldn't say this but if you Brothers know what it's like to have to have one wife to take care of you know he's uh he's taking care of the whole church and we know the church is a woman so you can imagine all the things that he's going through but y'all forgive me I'm just excited but but you know the man needs prayer is that right amen but we love you tonight we appreciate you we are not going to try to hold you along tonight but if you have your Bibles tonight if we could turn to Matthew the sixth chapter and the 25th verse amen just so honored to be here and you know my buddy Emmanuel and sister Grace surprised me tonight you know what was funny was I tried to surprise Abel and Destiny I called him about seven o'clock I said what are you doing man he said man I'm trying to get ready for church trying to get there on time I said man I'm thinking about visiting tonight and they said really I said yeah man can you give me that address and he said yeah sure so he gave me the address and and I'm sure he probably figured out when he walked in the door I wouldn't just visited him tonight but then my I got one a prank put on me I guess because my friends are here I wasn't expecting to be here so it's good to see them as well hey man Matthew 6 and 25 and we want to take a text tonight I haven't uh I actually had this on my heart and I appreciate it New Year's and I haven't preached in quite some time but it just came on my heart and I couldn't get it off and and you'll understand when I say this when we get down to it but that last song We sang and and the things that uh brother Stephen said there I tell you what to let you know I was right on track so we're going to preach on this uh we're going to take a text tonight of my provider all right Matthew 6 and 25 amen and it says therefore I say unto you take no fault for your life what you shall eat or what you shall drink amen nor yet for your body what ye shall put on is not the life more than meat and the body than raiment yes and he says here behold the fowls of the air for they sow not neither do they reap nor gather into barns yet your heavenly father feedeth them and it says here are ye not much better than they which of You by taking thought can add one cubit unto his stature and why take ye thought for Raymond consider the lilies of the field how they grow they tool not neither do they spin and yet I say unto you that even Solomon and All His glory was not arrayed like one of these wherefore if God so clothed the grass of the field which today is and tomorrow is cast in the oven shall he not much more clothe You O ye of little faith I think that's a rebuke that we could all take tonight and say Lord help me therefore take no fault don't even take thought about it saying what shall we eat or what shall we drink or where will shall we be clothed for after all these things do the Gentiles seek it says listen to your church it says for your heavenly father knoweth that you have need of all these things but seek ye first don't worry about everything else just seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness and all of these things will be added unto you so what God is saying here you just seek me first and all these other things they're just benefits no there's many things that when we go to look for a job and we go to sign up for something we say well what benefits does it have when I when I do this job we'll give you this bonus maybe you get a a quarterly bonus or a or a half year bonus or a Christmas bonus and all those different things but God's saying listen just seek me first and don't worry about the rest because I will be your provider we can look at this you know the sparrow he isn't worried about tomorrow or where he's going to get his food and I want to say this if if God would care so much for a stinking possum I don't know about y'all but I don't care much for a possum but God cares so much for a possum that he would send that possum to a prophet to be prayed forth are you not much better than that possum but I want you to know we have the assurance that God is going to take care of us but we must first seek the kingdom and I want to read this before I let you see this in Genesis 22 because I want you to know God has how many knows that God doesn't have to change his mind God doesn't have to change his word because his first thought is his best thought so whatever God said we can look in his word and know I don't care when he wrote this whether he wrote it 6 000 years ago two thousand years ago God's word still Reigns true today so if we can read in Genesis 22 that he already promised that we would overcome and he said in 22 16 he said and I have said by myself I'm so thankful that he said it by himself and he didn't say it by Seth coffee because Seth coffee will let you down but he said I said by myself I have sworn saith the Lord for because thou has done this thing and that's not withheld my son he's speaking to Abraham now about Isaac thy only son that in blessing I Will Bless thee and it multiply I will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven and as the sand which is upon the sea sure and listen Church it doesn't say in thy seed might possess thy seed may be will possess his head in thy seed shall possess the Gate of his enemies now I want you to notice that doesn't say enemy that says enemies because let me tell you what you're going through might not be my enemy your gate might not be my gate but he's already promised whatever your gate is you're going to possess it I want you to know tonight what is the gate here's what the gate is and what that means and in the old days you had a castle and the weakest or the strongest point of that castle was that gate if you could ever get through that gate you could get into the castle and God is saying whatever you need whatever you have to accomplish whatever stronghold is trying to bind you you already have possession of the gate man let us bow our heads Heavenly fathers for we come before you tonight almighty God Lord I'm surrendering myself to you Lord just now father I pray that you would take complete preeminence of the service father Lord these people Lord I know with whom My Heart Lord just fill in the pool Lord the Willing Lord to receive father the Lord Within Myself there's nothing I can give them Lord but I believe that Jehovah Jireh almighty God is still here father I believe El Shady eye is still here Lord the strong-breasted one almighty God I believe that we could just nurse from the word of God Lord I'm asking not only this Lord don't just fill your people Lord but feel me as well almighty God with what you want me to have almighty god father I pray that Lord there wouldn't be one person Lord in this building oh Lord how it stirs my heart father Lord when I listen to those tapes father and at the end of it Lord he would say every single person in the building is healed and delivered in the name of Jesus Christ last father this is the time of that Faith this is the time of that Deliverance father I believe not one person has to go home empty-handed Lord but we are possessors of the gate tonight almighty God the gate has already been given to us almighty God so father we're here to possess what you've already paid for what you've already given us oh Lord how silly would it be Lord Lord if I could just say it this way how silly it would be father if we needed a car and you've already given us a car but we decided to walk to work almighty God but Lord you've already given us everything that we have need of in this service Lord and we're here to possess it Lord and we'll be like Jacob tonight almighty God when that angel comes by when that angel comes by we'll grab a hold and we ain't Letting Go almighty God till you bless us father because you already promised that you would Lord father we love you we praise you bless your people in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen you may seated now I would like to speak on that text my provider tonight and then and you know I want to read this because you know there was a when you think of my provider the first thing you think of is Jehovah Jireh my provider and you know I must admit this and my failures that that you know when I was looking at Jehovah Jireh for a long time I just thought of Jehovah Jireh as the sacrifice as a sacrificial lamb that would come and die for our sins but one morning when I woke up and I was going fishing I began to turn on a tape and when I turned on that tape I heard something that changed the way that I looked at Jehovah Jireh for the rest of my life and and I woke up early and I turned on a tape and brother random said what happened God seen a need for a ram and he spoke the ram into existence in one minute and five minutes later it went out of existence why Abraham said we'll call the name of that place Jehovah Jireh the Lord will divide the Lord will provide himself a sacrifice now here's where I missed it church he said no matter what your need is now God has already provided a ram for your sacrifice God has already provided a way for your eternal life God has provided a lamb for your Resurrection God has provided around to take those gray hairs and wrinkled face and turn them back to a new man and a woman again God has provided I tell you what I love the message of the hour God has provided a way to straighten that crooked hand God has provided a way to take the death of cancer away from you put life in there God's sacrifices already been provided he said shall we pray Heavenly Father oh when I think of that word Jehovah Jireh the Lord will provide himself a sacrifice in other words in other words you are the all-sufficient one and you can meet every condition when Abraham needed strength you spoke to him and said I am the breasted one just nurse here and I'll show you I'm going to turn you back to a young man again Abraham you're old but I'm God I'll tell you Satan tries to to say there's not going to be a body change and maybe we're getting older we might be getting older but let me tell you something there's still always a god yes oh Father and when we need when the need come for a sacrifice you had one provided you just spoke it into existence just at the time to save the life of Isaac and father how much more have you provide a sacrifice tonight for these your children has come through the snow out here tonight to listen to The Gospel you've got a sacrifice provided just now for them God's lamb slain from the foundation of the world that their life may be spared that their tears might be over that the dreads of death and the old grave out there in the snow sweeping across it tonight knowing that maybe this time next year they would be in that same place but God has provided a sacrifice for Resurrection God has provided someone for the old God has provided someone for the sinful and unclean he's willing and he's offered and the blood flows freely you provided a sacrifice I tell you what we could just close after this you provide a sacrifice for healing you've provided sacrifice to take away all the worries and troubles and the threats and fears you're still somebody say you're still you're still Jehovah Jireh and we love these supremely with all our hearts how many is thankful for that I tell you I'm going to say that I was wrong I missed it by a million miles he was not just a sacrifice but he's the sacrifice to meet each and every one of our needs I'm so thankful we have a provider tonight and you know there's something about a provider he always seems to be preparing and prepping and you know we have these things called Doomsday Preppers and and they're they're little they're little sheds and and bunkers and everything they make is going to fail but I want you to know that our God is a prepper our God is a prepper I want you to know the lamb wasn't slain 2 000 years ago Jehovah Jireh on the cross 2 000 years ago but it says the lamb was slain before the foundation of the world blessed be the name of the Lord before your mama ever knew you before your daddy ever knew you before they ever even thought about having you God was decided he already knew he was going to take care of you hey man he's a prepper but in the message of Grace brother Brandon he said I turned and looked again and I screamed out oh God you know where I'm going oh God what would you have your servant know just then the spirit of the Lord came in and said Jesus Jesus song were you singing [Applause] Jesus of the New Testament is Jehovah of the old he only changed his mask from Spirit to man now I want to read this here now this is David because I want you to know they didn't know the the name of Jehovah they knew the titles but they didn't know the name but David would say I Cried unto the Lord with my voice with my voice and the Lord did I make my supplication I poured out my complaint before them I sold before him my trouble when my spirit was overwhelmed with him then thou knowest my path in the way when I walk they have privilege laid a snare for me I looked on my right hand and behold there was an old man that would know me Refuge failed me no man cared for my soul where David is at right now is David is a rejected King the very King that he is supposed to be the very nation has rejected him and right now he is in a cave crying out going God you are my refuge no man cared for my soul I cried to the own Lord I said Thou Art my refuge and my portion in the land of the living and in Proverbs he would run this the name of the Lord is a strong tower the righteous runeth into it and it's safe but I want you to know when David was in such a stress he would have to go through the list and find the name that he would need you have Jehovah child or the Lord will provide himself a sacrifice Jehovah Rapha the Lord our healer Jehovah Nissi the Lord our Banner Jehovah Shalom the Lord our peace Jehovah the Lord Our Shepherd Jehovah Tisch canoe the Lord our righteousness are Jehovah the Lord is present so in the middle of that prayer when he would begin to say it if I can say it this way if this is all right at the end of the prayer he would say in the name of Jehovah shalom he would have to find the right title to go with the name that he was praying for but I'm so glad tonight that you know David had a stress reliever in such a time he could say Jehovah Shalom but I'm so glad to know what our peace is you say what is our stress reliever what's looking for Philippians wherefore God hallelujah wherefore God also highly exalted him and given him a name giving him a name which is above every name that the name of Jesus every knee should bow of things in heaven in things in Earth and things under the Earth in the name of Jesus yes my brother oh boy I knew I was in the right channel I was coming out I said praise blessed be the name of the Lord hallelujah do you realize that name Jesus that the first time that name Jesus was ever spoken between two Mortals yeah they were sitting there talking and Mary went to Elizabeth and she began to say there's this baby in my womb but it ain't moving I said but by the way what what's the name of the baby that God has given you and she said his name is Jesus about that time John's body jumped the line yes there was such a power in that name there was a provider on the Earth right there the name of the Lord Jesus Christ was so powerful now listen it wasn't a mighty preacher but it was two little women sitting there having a conversation you ain't got to be some big great person just speak the name of Jesus one time and watch the miraculous come in the manifestation because let me tell you something when you call on the name of Jesus it said in his name shall be called wonderful counselor So when you say Jesus you're saying wonderful counselor when you're stressed when you're overwhelmed and you don't know where to go and which way to turn and you say Jesus you say wonderful counselor the Everlasting father that's the Prince of Peace Emmanuel lily of the valley the rose of Sharon Almighty alpha and omega beginning in the end the first and the last the king of the Kings the Lord of lords there's a lamb of God Messiah when you follow the name of Jesus you're calling on a name that's above each and every one of your problems because he's given the name that's above every name he's given a name that's above that sickness he's given you a name that's about that lust he's giving you a name that's above that cancer he's giving you a name that's above that hey he is a provider he's been providing for his children ever since the beginning and he's still providing tonight's my brother he's a name above depression the name of a sickness the name above love cancer fear heartache hey complexes loneliness covet he's the name above every name amen Glory Hallelujah yes [Applause] preach [Applause] you say does it work does it work s [Music] you know why you know why I wasn't tore up and worry about preaching this service tonight because my little daughter prayed for me my little four my little three-year-old I told her it was last night we went to sleep on the couch together and I was laying there and I had her on my arm and I said I said I gotta she said what are you doing that answer I gotta I gotta go preach tomorrow and and I said I'm kind of nervous about it and boy I hadn't asked for anything and she just Lord Daddy's got to preach tomorrow you help him do good she said you bring him home to me and she said amen she said and she said it's okay Daddy I asked Jesus to help you that's it yes my brother I tell you what I want I want I feel led to go back to that you don't have to be some great ministry you don't have to be the best evangelist you don't even have you don't you don't have to be that that extreme prayer Warrior let me tell you something that little girl I had a man I had a grown man come up to me and he said I want to tell you something I said what is it he said I had hurt my knee and my knee had swelling up and I was in pain and your daughter came up to me and laid her hand on my knee and said Jesus make his knee better and she went on back to what she was doing he said but I'll tell you what I woke up the next day and all the swelling was gone all the time at the name of Jesus yes sir foreign [Applause] shall confess but what we can take comfort in Jehovah of the old being Jesus of the new if there's ever a time that you can look in the scripture and you can see where Jehovah was enough then you know let me tell you what you are called on the name of Jesus yes you automatically pick up each and every one of those seven compound names that's exactly right you know brother Branham brother Bosworth versus brother best and he said he was going to put brother bass in the corner because brother bass begin to say that that he's not a Healer and he said I want to ask you something does the seven compound names of Jehovah apply to Jesus Christ or not and that ended it that's it because he couldn't say that Jesus was the deity and he was in one but he wasn't in the other so we can say tonight that no matter what our situation is yes my brother I want to tell you something I've never seen a time in my life where times are so stressful that's right but I want you to know when you speak the name Jesus yes sir you're already picking up Jehovah Shalom that's right and if Jehovah Shalom was enough for David in his time of hey when he was in the middle of a cave completely rejected but he would find a refuge in the name of Jehovah shalom how much more in this day and age will we have a name of every name that we can find Refuge tonight amen the scripture says very familiar Jehovah Rapha the Lord our healer surely he hath borne our griefs and carried our sorrows where is Jehovah Rapha yet we did esteem him stricken smitten of God Afflicted but he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him and by his stripes we are healed finished settled Jehovah Rapha changed his mask and dwelled in the body of Jesus Christ in Isaiah would say I see Jehovah Rapha coming I see him he's on his way and he didn't know his name but when he came who was that speaking of it was speaking of Jesus surely he has borne our grief we don't have to have grief tonight because we have a provider yes my brother you know how many beliefs know what not that ye now are the sons of God don't you know that you are the children of God and you know who takes care of the children the father you know who the provider is the father I I love using this illustration I love using my kids because I tell you if I ever learn the love of God it was from being a parent because I realized something when I had that child she didn't have to do anything to Merit my love that was my child you mess with her you mess with me you hurt her feelings this ain't very Christian but I'm gonna hurt you you don't mess with my kids now but but but you see what I'm saying and you can see that every time someone hurt the children of Israel they should have never done it they should have never hurt God's children but do you know when we go through this life and my little girl wants a Happy Meal she doesn't go and check her bank account but she's got money for a Happy Meal because she don't have a bank account because she don't need one because she has a provider she don't worry about who's going to pay the power bill she don't worry about how she's going to get to church she don't worry about where she's going to get her clothes from but seek ye first the kingdom of God and all these other things will be added unto you amen I don't think you realize how blessed you are tonight that when you come to the house of God I believe it was David in Psalms 103 he said forget not all of his benefits you are a beneficial people tonight you are beneficiaries of this Resurrection when you come to the house of God tonight you know what it means to be a beneficiary I looked it up it says it means you have an advantage blessed be the name of the Lord do you realize when you woke up this morning you already had an advantage over Satan says you already had an advantage blessed be the name of the Lord would you like to read it I believe I have it in here preach my brother bless the Lord O my soul and forget not all his benefits who forgiveth all that iniquities who healeth all that is Jesus who redeemeth thy life from destruction who crowneth thee with loving kindness and Tender Mercies who satisfy thy mouth with good things so that that youth is renewed like the eagle I'm gonna tell you I have to say this right here because God told me to that was a time brother I was feeling down when I began I don't remember what message it was but I turned it on and brother Brandon began to talk about that eagle yes sir and about how it would go through that renewing of life and now it's how it's how its beak would film over and his feathers would get all crusty and and he couldn't Fly Away but if he could ever just beat his beak on the rock I don't know where you are yes but if you can ever I don't care how you're feeling because I want to say this your beak may be crusted over your feathers may be falling out but you're still an eagle that's it that's it your situation yes your circumstance yes will never change the fact yes that you're still an eagle yes my brother you might have had a hard time at work this week you might have a lot of family problems but it will not change who you are yes sir I may be going through sickness in my body that you know what that's gonna say it I might not be the best Christian one week I might have a lot of problems in my life but guess what that never changes the fact that I'm Mark coffey's son and it doesn't matter where you are or what you're going through it'll never change the fact that you're a daughter of almighty God that's him it'll never change the fact that you're a Son of God but what you have to do which is go to the right yes my brother and who is that rock Russ what's the Rock's name yes my brother it's Jesus yes and it doesn't matter where you are how low you're feeling you can go to the father you can go to the provider what was it that Jesus said they said what is the name of God he said I come in my father's name what is the name of the Father which is Jesus yes my brother the Lord executed this righteousness and judgment for all I love how he keeps putting all in there because he knows there's no situation there's no circumstance it doesn't matter how your feelings the Lord all that are oppressed he made known his ways unto Moses his acts unto the children of Israel the Lord is merciful and gracious slow to anger plenteous in Mercy I just got to preach from my heart and then I keep feeling led to Gold I don't know where you're at tonight I don't know what mistakes you made but for every mistake there's more Mercy because I want to tell you something he's the father he's the father he's the father he's the father Yes my brother you say what do you mean I'll tell you this my children have aggravated me to no end before my children have drove me up a wall my children made me where I think I'm gonna lose my mind but not one time did I ever stop loving them yes and I'm nowhere near him will never amount to the father that our father Heavenly Father foreign yes to my brother he knows that we're nothing but dust but he chose us I love that in Jeremiah 5. at the beginning of Jeremiah or Jeremiah 1 5 yes sir he begins to tell Jeremiah now you Prophet yes you're going to have to do these things Jeremiah but don't worry about Jeremiah I already know you knew you before you were ever formed in your mother's womb I knew you yes my brother [Applause] oh God already made his decision he wasn't the lame he wasn't the lamb slain yesterday a week ago 2 000 years ago he was the lamb slam before the foundation of the world and if he was slain before the foundation of the world there must have been somebody back there that he was dying for before the foundation of the world brother random said if you ever have eternal life you've always had eternal life Satan will try to rob you of that and take your eternal life so let me tell you something cause you said I've made mistakes and I've done things wrong boohoo you're still here you ain't gave up you ain't quit because greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world you might not know it but you got some Supernatural genetics I came into this world yes my brother I will boost up like my father my mama and daddy never had to tell me to talk like my father say stuff like my father but it's the genetics that are in me and you ain't got no losing Gene in you you've got a winning Gene you've got to overcome her a genius greater is he that is in you and he that is in the world you're still an eagle yes sir you might be in a valley but you're still an eagle I'll tell you what I would do I would take my wings I would take my feet yes sir and I was getting a break out of that thing and say this ain't who I am I'm an eagle fly out of that barnyard why out of those faults of negativity fly out of that that ain't Who You Are you have a provider he's a way you make a miracle worker I don't care how far it'll stand you've Fallen it ain't far enough at the hand of almighty God [Applause] I pray to God it never happens [Applause] I don't know where you are maybe you're a prodigal son but it never changed he wasn't called The Prodigal he was The Prodigal Son many times we come to the house of God going maybe I can praise my way back into his good good will maybe I can maybe I can just do something to earn his grace what did you ever do to earn his grace in the first place [Applause] if you if any one of you have obtained your own salvation by your good works please line up right here in front of me but if you but remember it takes Perfection so if any of you have made a mistake just please stay in your seat we get this I'm holier than you you're but we ain't you're either perfect or you're not I'm better than you you're better than me and we have all sin and come short of the glory of God but by one sacrifice this man who was this man it was our provider has perfected them forever so when you're in Christ tonight oh yeah maybe in this flesh you've made mistakes but on the inside of the inside that's a real you the real you who is that real you that real you is that something on the inside of you that you know you might have mistakes you might have failures but you ain't giving up and you wonder why you ain't giving up yes because the genetics on the inside of you won't allow you to [Applause] when brother Stephen text me on Tuesday Morning said well you preach for us Seth coffee said no I didn't want to preach this flesh didn't want to preach come on don't get quiet on me but you know what I begin to realize in that moment I begin to think everything that God has done for me everything that he has brought me through even though this flesh don't feel like it even though my nerves don't there was something deeper on the inside that began to say Lord I remember where you brought me from I remember where you brought me out of why because I was redeemable and let me tell you something to be redeemable you had to be owned by somebody somebody already had the new year he already had he came to take back to redeem what was already his so take courage tonight take joy tonight if you can hear the word of God and there's something on the inside of you saying that's the truth that's nothing but the truth I've been through a lot I'm going through things but I still love God um that's more than you that's God's love on the inside of you the scripture said we love him because he first loved us [Applause] hearing is love not that we love him Jesus but that he loved us why it's not hard to love Jesus Jesus is the perfect Son of God but this is love that he can look at us and through our failures and mistakes God don't see mistakes God sees Sons and Daughters of God glory to God yeah [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] even though that Bible is not where it's supposed to be right now because that's not his Bible that's Marvel but just because that Bible ain't where it's supposed to be right now it doesn't change the fact that that's my Bible [Applause] but a Stephen can say that's my Bible but you know what I know where that Bible came from my Grandpa gave me that Bible he don't know the he can't look up the title and know where that Bible came from but I know where that Bible came from that Bible was mine in the beginning before he just got that Bible that Bible was mine this brother here can't go get that Bible it's not his Bible that's my Bible he can go through the pages he could crinkle some things up but at the end of the day that's not his Bible that's my Bible and by the law of redemption I have a right to go he grabbed this Bible and say sorry sir that's not your Bible that's my Bible yes amen amen Satan might take you for a ride Satan might get in this mine and mess you up pretty bad Satan might tell you lies all through your life telling you'll never be good enough you'll never make it you came from the wrong kind of marriage and all these different things you'll never make it but guess what Satan ain't the owner of you [Applause] Satan is not your father but now we are the sons yes my brother [Applause] preach my brother you went home tonight and you legitimate people and there's a bunch of drunks and they're kicking around and carrying around smoking drinking cursing living immortally you say hey get out of here this is my house he said I'm a human being this was built for human beings and I've got it right here you'd say this is my house I have an abstract deed that proves this is my property then if you show him the deed and he will not move then there is a law down here that will make him move yes my brother yes my brother and if that devil that condensed and unite tried to send you to a premature grave tried to you up reap God's Abstract title deep amen by his stripes we were healed yes sir and if he don't want to believe that there's a holy ghost here the law of God that'll kick him out that'll prove it just ring up Jesus Central brother Brandon said that's j-e-s-u-s yeah find out if something don't take place the angles of God will take their position I want you to realize where you are amen I want you to realize who you are yes my brother this is your land yes sir I was listening to brother Brandon today and he said that body is your body the devil ain't got no right to be there that's your land yes my brother preach the angels of God will take their position and the devil will get out you stand there on your toes and say yes sir it's the truth amen not up here and down here you've read your title clear you know what it is hey man Church yes sir Christianity ain't just meant on top experiences walk in this narrow way ain't always the easiest way but I promise you wherever you are on that path if you're in a valley if you're on a mountain and let me tell you something if you're on a mountain fairly good don't worry you got a valley ahead of you but I want you to know it don't matter where you are on top or down low it doesn't change who you are [Applause] amen you can't said to Joshua and Caleb I give you the land the land is yours that's it but you're gonna fight yes yes the church can I say this the fight wasn't that hard all they had to do was walk and swing your sword if you do what God says that's it that's it that's it I'll say this most valleys are self-inflicted faults that's exactly right it's a time that we don't give God the prayer time that he deserves it's the time when you decide to get on Facebook instead of sticking your face in this book that's it it's the time where you're looking at everything on Instagram or Marketplace and I go into work and spending all your time at work instead of spending time with the Creator that's it if I want to know more about Stephen I'm not going to go halfway across North Carolina I'm going to come to him and talk to him and if you want a more a successful life with Jesus looking everywhere else and look to him hey man that's all free I don't know where that came from man how powerful is that name of Jesus you know there was a time that brother Brandon went into a place and there was these witches and they had this table floating up out of the off the ground brother Brandon walked in there and he said I said Lord Jesus you said in Saint Mark the 16th chapter in my name they shall cast out Devils I said now that I am your servant May nothing your servant may know as the battle lays before me I said I command the table to fall down in the name of the holy church and it stayed right there I said I command the table to fall in the name of the father of the Son and the Holy Ghost and it stayed right there I said I command that table to fall down in the name of Jesus Christ and it like to broke all four legs off hitting the floor those were titles this is a name I want you to realize every devil whether in this building or not wherever they try to be they know a name that's it they know the name of Jesus yes my brother they know Authority when you speak it when you speak the name of Jesus they begin to get fearful and and you know brother Brandon would even begin to say in that discernment this demon would begin to call up for that demon to help why are they calling for help because let me tell you something when I when I when I wasn't where I should be with God and and we knew there was going to be a fight and we we knew we couldn't win on our own we called someone else to help us so those devils are beginning to call on help because they realize we can't take on Jesus they realize if you ever believe yes sir and ever just call on the name of Jesus atmospheres will begin to change the pressures of this world will begin to release you will begin to go free because wherever Jesus went he cast out Satan and God cannot change look in the beginning when Michael who was that Michael it was Jesus when Lucifer decided I'm gonna take on Jesus because he's not the smartest Satan is not that smart he decides I'm going to take on Jesus I'm going to try to fight Jesus but you know what Jesus did he cast him out and then Satan has this great plan I'm going to dwell on Earth and I'm I'm gonna indwell in humans and ruin their life but here comes a little man named Jesus yes my brother he's on a boat and there's a sea that tries to drown him but when the wind kept coming and trying to the waves and the wind tried to drown Jesus Jesus just cast the spirits out that wind and that Tempest that tried to kill him Jesus just cast it out because let me tell you something and this is what you need to get there was one there was one on the other side there was one on the other side and you know what they even called him by the title of legion but that was not his name so Jesus begins to go to the other side and let me tell you something don't think because you're going through a trial that you ain't a son and daughter of God that's the best case that you are a son and daughter of God when Satan's trying to stop the move of the Holy Ghost in your life is I'll tell you what if I didn't have no problems and everything was going right I would check myself I would check what I believed but as he gets held on the other side there's a man there and he's covered in a legion of devils he's covered in a legion of devils and he's Bound by a legion of devils but that's not who he is that might be his problem I keep going back I've never preached a sermon this way he might have problems he might have situations but those Legion of devils could never change who he was he was tucked away in a cave sometimes in our own carnality we limit God that's exactly the limit what God that's exactly right he's sitting back there in a cave and he's cutting himself and he's miserable and he's ruined his life with his family you know maybe I say this be careful tonight be careful because I want to tell you Legion never just became that overnight but it started with one thing from that time maybe it was an innocent after work drink that's exactly right the next thing you know he drunk in the spirit that's it and another Spirit God will hold up that depression came into his life so he had to drink more to try to forget about it and another spirit and another spirit until he was completely bound he was so bound he was sitting there maybe you have lost loved ones you're praying for right now and maybe you say man they're just so bound but he's in there and he's cutting himself and he's miserable and he's looking back on his life and he's been going oh why did I do it this way why do that and the demons are going shut up the demons are going let's call him Caleb for a second and he said the demons are going Caleb this is who you are this is who you are now Caleb this is you this is who you'll always be Caleb ra you will never get out of this Caleb preach my brother Caleb you will be depressed for the rest of your life Caleb you will cut yourself for the rest of your life modern day Caleb you'll be hooked on that pornography for the rest of your life Caleb you'll be addicted of those drugs for the rest of your life and there was times he would begin to believe it did you say this is who I just if I could be delivered the priests would have already delivered me or somebody would have believed preacher Jones preacher Jones would have delivered me a preacher Seth would have delivered me begin to say Kayla began to go I feel like I just I feel like this will never end I feel like no matter what I can't get out of this I feel like every time I think I find my joy I'll lose it again but he knew through all those voices something inside of Caleb on the Deep Side [Music] maybe it was something his mama told him on his lap on her lap all those years ago Pam one day there's going to be a messiah those demons would say shut up don't believe that message of the hour don't believe that thing that's coming but there was something on the inside and let me tell you something Jesus begins to step out on that Shore and when he's stepping there those demons begin to have PTSD and they begin to go I know who that is [Music] I know who that is have you gonna talk did you feel that [Music] [Applause] hey hey did you the whole legion's getting together and having a conference if I'm not mistaken when we were in heaven and Lucifer told us all to gather together did you not feel that did you not feel that same presence and they began to go yeah I think that's him I think that's him and they began to go well let's just go look and they begin to run out there and the closer they begin they go oh I know who that is you see the demons have never forgot ever since the beginning who that is why do you think they try so hard to keep you out of church where two or three are gathered in my name there will I be in the midst when you come into this place the Devils begin to go I know who that is I know who that is but if they can keep you from believing they can have victory I want you to realize that's the only thing that Satan has many mighty Works he couldn't do because of their unbelief I want you I want to say it this way you walked into that door right there you were as free could be you remember what brother Branham told the story about Johnny Crowe how they would tie Johnny Crow to a stream right he would walk in a circle over and over one day old Feller came by and said man I really feel sorry for that guy if I can say it this way and old evangelist came through and he went up to Jerry Crow yes and he cut it and he said you're free but those demons had told Jerry you'll never or Johnny you'll never ever ever ever ever ever get out of this Johnny but Johnny was already free when you walk through that door you're already free but you can't keep going in the same Circle somebody's got to break the cycle you say well my family has dealt with alcoholism my whole life somebody's got to break the side that's exactly right this Halo tobacco ISM and all these are different addictions have random mind in my family somebody has to break the side that's exactly right your father and your grandpa could have broke that cycle but they never realized they were already free and when Legion began to walk out there those Legion of devils I had Caleb bound they didn't go out there to Jesus and say hey man let's let's try to have a good fight let's put on a good match he said please just don't torture us before our town [Applause] just let us go into the swine and Jesus says go I know I've slowed down a lot but I want you to realize the Simplicity of the Gospel [Music] the things I'm ministering and I understand the things in your life that you've held on to for so long the problems the things that you've battled you're free it's easy it's easy to say oh Jesus raised Lazarus from the dead Jesus healed the leper what about you [Applause] did his name change did the provider change who changed who changed now listen circumstance doesn't change who you are but who changed you did I did Seth coffee on Tuesday didn't feel like preaching I'm being honest with you Church I ain't never gonna get up here and be more holier than now but you know what I began to think of Paul and Silas and I began to think even in the midst of their try their neighbor going through it and you know they probably physically didn't feel like praising God but they begin to realize that God's taking care of us and you know what I begin to realize even though I don't feel so good even though I don't feel like in my flesh to preach I'm still a son of God and something begin to rise up on me I'm just going to tell you the whole truth I called Richie Douglas to get some encouragement and he didn't answer but in between him answering and calling me back I realized I'm still a Son of God that's my brother and he called me and he said is this that Mighty Man of Valor I say yes it is this is him you got the right number you got the right number and we need to realize tonight we ain't just a bunch of whips we're the Sons and Daughters of almighty God there ain't a devil big enough there ain't a devil strong enough there ain't no gonna lie too strong that we can't take the Simplicity of the word of God oh he might have he might have made his voice for days and days and days and days and days and days but some David's got to stand up and say that's enough is there any David's in here [Applause] is this that mighty medabella this is the daughter of Zion yes my brother Satan that's enough [Applause] let's take those stones if he picked up those stones faith in Jesus brother Brandon typed it faith in the provider when you have the Holy Ghost listen Satan ain't fighting Seth coffee Satan's fighting almighty God Paul said Lord I'll never deny you I'll never deny you Lord I'll never let you down lord I've got your back Lord Peter before the Cockroach three times you're gonna deny me I ain't gonna deny you Lord and he denied him but that never changed the fact that Peter was still a son but you know what Peter was a different man after the upper room these 120 that were hid back inside of this room but when the power of the Holy Ghost when the indwelling of almighty God came and dwelt on the inside of them boy they busted out of that house and they began to all talk in new tongues and people said these are drunk on new wine he said we ain't drunk like you suppose this is a different kind of wine but you know what it was the indwelling of the Holy Ghost came in but do you know what that Holy Ghost did it didn't put something new in there it brought out what was already there it quickened the sea that was on the inside even though Peter had mistakes even though Peter did things wrong when the Holy Ghost came over him it brought the real Peter out it brought him out to a place that he wasn't worried that he would go anywhere that he would be in jail that he would be into a place where he would have so much faith in God that an angel would come and say come on Peter let's go let's get on out of here you ain't got to stay here no longer and I want you to know the angel of the Lord is still here the angel of the Lord is still coming by and he's going to ever ever prison door and unlocking the doors and saying you can go free if you want to you can go free if you want to but it's up to you [Applause] amen I know it's a Wednesday night and we'll come real close have you been encouraged tonight you have to realize that your provider is greater than your need you know what that is what a provider is a provider is someone that has the resources that are greater than what you need or what your obstacle is whether it be depression whatever you're going through you see I need the Holy Ghost there's one here that can give it he has it he can provide it I tell you I've seen so many miracles in the name of Jesus I can't even can't in my in my own I don't want to call it my Ministry because it's the bride's Ministry but church just over the new year I've seen a woman and she came up and she said I've been battling arthritis in my shoulder and my elbow and my wrist and she said will you pray for me because I told her I said you know there's a name above that arthritis and we laid hands on the sick and they shall recover I've seen a god of 2000 years ago this is a god of two weeks ago that is still here today right now the same yesterday today and forever and I prayed for her in that moment you know we got done praying and the spirit of God was moving and after that service she came to me she took that bad arm and she shook my hand and she said ever a bit of the pain has left me arthritis can't stay in the presence of Jesus none of your circumstances are big enough strong enough great enough to sin in the way of Jesus Christ amen amen I want to turn the corner and I'll close to my brother you know blessed to have a good Earthly father I was my father always took still taking care of me I caught him today but I look I never worried I never worried about anything you know there was once there would be things that I wanted brother Stephen I didn't need but he would still give it to me that's right there's times when we come to God and we say God God knows you don't even need it amen but if it makes you happy he wants you I'm an amen amen he might know that that you're in a trial and you don't need out of that trial yet you're not at your breaking point but God will just give you the Deliverance you want and he cares for you yes my brother but well the point I'm trying to make is I look back on my life I used to play sports I never paid for the entry fees I never bought my own clothes because my father took care of me but you know I can say this as much as I love my Earthly father and all the things that he'd done for me and still does for me my father never gave me life my father Earthly father never put this heartbeat in my chest my Earth and father didn't give me my right mind my Earthly father didn't give me the peace that I have amen and I'll tell you this when you can look it's your provider yes my brother and I'll tell you what I'm 20 27 years old now but the last 12 years which I mean my whole life but when I was 15 years old when I gave my heart to the Lord I can look back and I can say there was a lot of Trials brother Stephen there was church problems there was family problems there was a drinking problems smoking problems women everything through all my life but after I gave my heart to the Lord he changed all my desires amen he took care of me yes my brother and through my journey there's been problems but I can tell you this there's never been one time I've been amen there was never one time amen that I ever needed one thing that my heavenly father didn't provide for me there was never one time that I got to a point maybe I was so depressed because things weren't going my way and I came to church and I thought I'll never make it out of this but God in his rich and mercy came down and delivered me from it there's been times Church where I was so nervous and overwhelmed I was so gripped with fear I didn't know where I was going to turn I didn't know where how I was going to overcome and it seemed like nothing would help me I would pray and I would pray and I would pray but in one moment yes my brother when no one else could help Jesus made the difference I look back on my life I'm David in the psalm he says remember the Lord he begins to say remember when he said he was David was discouraged and he encouraged himself by remembering how God would bring the children of Israel through the Red Sea and all the mighty works that he did and when he got done talking about it he began to be encouraged I mean I want you to realize tonight that you can be encouraged because this is not your end he is not just the author of our faith not just the finisher of our faith but he is the author and finisher of our faith what does an altar do an author writes the book you don't have control over the book the author has already wrote out your life and at the end of your story he wrote victory your name has been written down in the Lamb's Book of Life it's been written in the rightful owner's hand and he won't let Satan take your name out of that book I'm in yes my brother I want to say that now listen don't you ever think out of this service that I'm giving you a license to sin because I'll tell you what your very desire has changed I'm not saying you won't make a mistake but it won't be your desire to make that mistake so you can't just go around yelling I'm a Son of God I'm a Son of God getting getting drunk as a skunk you you might be a Son of God but you need to come out of that and there's a way for you to come out of that but I want you to know how amazing God is I can read in Genesis plain as day I will turn in Genesis and I will see Abraham staggering at the promise of God I will see him go into a place where they say who is that he says that's my sister that is not my wife that's my sister because he got scared he staggered at the promise of God when he should have had faith but he was staggering saying oh no no no and then the king says well I'll just take Sarah for a while this didn't happen once this happened twice twice in Genesis but then Paul yes my brother in Romans will get the inspiration from almighty God and he will begin to say Abraham staggered not at the promise of God blessed is the man that God will not impute sin thank you he's got your name written on the Lamb's Book of Life Satan will say he staggered here she staggered there she made this mistake she made that mistake and God will look right to you in the face and say but they staggered not at the promise of almighty God they are perfect wow brother by him says I'll never be perfect and you'll never be perfect but we rest in this one thing we have a perfect sacrifice for the random chance at that woman that was in that restaurant he said I began to judge her she had the the the I can't remember how that was but at least she had the blue hair the blue fingernails wearing stuff that wasn't modest and brother Brandon began to say how could you ever God let let let my children grow up in this why don't you just wipe it off the face of the Earth and he said come over here real quick and let me show you something and he said I began to look at that and he said I wasn't sitting like that but yet there was still little things that were sent you ain't no better than the next person don't you ever get that Holy Spirit that you're better than the next one without the grace of God you're nothing thank you Prince my brother he said I was sitting there and every time I would do something my sin was headed to the throne but Jesus was there Hallelujah that's the difference he said and every time my sin would go there Jesus would get in front of it it would hit him and it would hurt him but he wasn't blocking my sin from dead to the throne he said I would have died if it ever got there but Jesus wouldn't let it get there and they begin to say and he's beginning to say oh Father oh Father for I want to know I want you to know wherever you are tonight let me show you how to get out of brother random said oh Father forgive me forget not all his benefits yes my brother he forgives us of all our sins all our iniquities he would say father forgive me and he said he took that blood from his side and wrote on their pardon that's what our provider does when we couldn't save

I'm going to say it a name of a minister came to my mind to preach tonight and I took the text message and I wrote to that minister and I opened my text message in my mind that's the minister I was sending the message and I took the text I put it and I send it and after a while I went back I opened a look it was not the minister I was thinking the text message went to brother said coffee and brother said responded back he say I am available to preach I know it's God okay so just know he's not here by mistake I was looking at this direction and God changed my mind unconsciously to send a message in what we can call a wrong direction but I'm telling you that so when you go home remember this man stood here he's he's standing here have nothing to do with a human being okay it is God that sent him here to tell you something and you heard him he didn't want to preach and God took him because God wants him to be the one he's going to use tonight to bring you your deliverance
