[23:43] as well amen
[23:46] praise the Lord
[23:50] so
[23:52] we enjoyed a little bit of Fellowship
[23:54] yesterday working over here emptying the
[23:55] trailer out I want to give praise God
[23:57] for that because it's always good to
[23:59] work well with the brothers amen amen

[24:13] so let's give the Lord a clap awesome
[24:15] for her
[24:16] It's Already Done amen
[24:20] now we neglected to mention
[24:22] um
[24:24] brother Seth had a birthday with him
[24:25] what was it a week it's been about a
[24:27] week now
[24:29] he's trying to sneak under the radar but
[24:33] sister guilty Beth had one I believe it
[24:35] was yesterday or two days ago right
[24:37] so let's give a clap offering to our to
[24:39] our family members to celebrate it
[24:41] another birthday amen
[24:43] praise the Lord
[24:46] now last Wednesday
[24:49] the devil was trying to attack one of
[24:51] our little brothers brother Elijah
[24:53] okay he was getting in his trying to get
[24:56] on his body and stuff and uh sister
[24:58] Kayla says it was happening right here
[25:01] and um
[25:04] then in the car on Thursday also
[25:07] and Elijah to quote said Mom
[25:11] the devil has no control over my body
[25:13] because I'm a son of God
[25:15] and he began to sing praises
[25:19] Amen to God
[25:22] and the coffin stopped amen praise the
[25:26] Lord amen
[25:29] glory to God
[25:32] so I have a couple of um prayer requests
[25:35] and then um Brother Sam has a spoken
[25:37] prayer request and I'll just ask you to
[25:39] pray over these other ones Brother Sam
[25:42] so let me read this because brother
[25:44] Lamont sent this to me you know last
[25:46] last Sunday I believe it was all the way
[25:48] last Sunday he was having some back pain
[25:51] and uh
[25:53] so he sent me a text
[25:55] this morning
[25:58] and he said uh
[26:01] he said God bless you he said please
[26:03] continue to keep me in prayer my lower
[26:05] back pain is gone but now the pain is on
[26:07] my right hip to lower right leg and my
[26:10] right foot my wife and I call that a
[26:13] move in pain because it's always moving
[26:15] somewhere else you know
[26:18] but
[26:19] it's a lie it's a lion vanity so let's
[26:22] remember brother Lamont
[26:24] amen
[26:25] we want to continue
[26:27] to remember sister coats as well amen
[26:33] um brother Charles
[26:36] the middle Charles
[26:38] amen
[26:40] he he there's going to be I guess it's
[26:43] going to be a decision made this week
[26:45] concerning his job and a new position
[26:48] that will allow him to be here on
[26:51] Wednesdays
[26:53] so that's why he wants everybody to pray
[26:55] about it amen
[26:57] you know that says they're sitting down
[27:00] about the particulars and that's the
[27:02] main one for him that that they let him
[27:05] they tell him that they're going to let
[27:07] him be here on a on a Wednesday hey man
[27:10] that's important I had my schedule by
[27:13] the glory of God
[27:14] redone so we could be here as well so
[27:17] let's remember that and then last but
[27:20] not least
[27:21] um
[27:23] before we bring Brother Sam up
[27:26] yesterday as we were cleaning this
[27:28] trailer this old trailer out the man was
[27:31] supposed to come and pick it up but
[27:33] there was some question about the
[27:35] condition of the trailer
[27:36] and how far it would make it off the
[27:39] property
[27:40] so that's a concern
[27:42] so we're wanting to bring up before the
[27:44] church to pray for
[27:46] a feasible solution
[27:49] God bless you my brother good to see you
[27:51] sister
[27:52] a feasible solution
[27:55] to the removal of this old trailer
[27:58] because not you know we don't need it
[28:00] anymore and it is an eyesore and you
[28:02] know it's probably got dry rotted
[28:04] Airlines and dry rotted tires and no
[28:07] tail lights and other things that will
[28:09] keep it unsafe if it were to leave the
[28:12] property and I think they're afraid that
[28:14] once it leaves the property it's theirs
[28:15] and they'll be responsible for it which
[28:17] you know I would be fearful there's a
[28:19] few of us that have or have had CDLs and
[28:23] we don't think we'd touch it you know so
[28:26] we need it gone though we're we're
[28:29] tossing some ideas around but um just
[28:32] come on up brother Sam just keep that on
[28:35] your prayer list because you know God
[28:37] gave us such a pretty little building
[28:39] didn't he and we've done so much with it
[28:42] and we're thankful because he meets us
[28:45] here every time we open these doors he's
[28:47] here with us
[28:49] and
[28:50] we just want to uh
[28:52] we just want to do our best for him amen
[28:56] so we want to pray about that and see
[28:58] about having it removed amen
[29:02] praise the Lord
[29:04] is everybody happy
[29:06] I hope
[29:08] well I have a little announcement to
[29:11] make first
[29:13] so um
[29:15] I guess you can they remain standing for
[29:18] our wedding the the minister forgot to
[29:21] tell everybody to sit down so the whole
[29:22] time we're at the altar they they remain
[29:24] standing you remember Earl Heist
[29:27] you remember him Earl Heist anyways he
[29:29] was up in Maryland
[29:30] so anyways brother Charles knows the
[29:33] little church up there in Northeast
[29:35] brother Ron Walbert and them and we
[29:37] Fellowship there for several years and
[29:40] God has placed it on my heart and Sister
[29:42] Teresa's heart to return there
[29:45] and that's the announcement that I want
[29:47] to make
[29:48] and uh because it's been kind of a
[29:50] lingering thing and I didn't
[29:52] intentionally mean it to be that way but
[29:55] you know the Bible said the steps of the
[29:57] Lord are ordered the steps of a
[29:59] righteous man are ordered of the Lord
[30:01] and sometimes God doesn't tell us
[30:03] everything right up front
[30:05] so we get one step at a time and we
[30:07] don't even know exactly what we're doing
[30:09] so it's hard to make an announcement and
[30:11] tell everybody what we're doing
[30:13] but if everything works out and it looks
[30:16] like it is we put our house up for sale
[30:18] much more than what it's worth and it's
[30:21] sold uh well we got a contract on either
[30:24] the first or the second buyer we're uh
[30:26] first to the second viewer so it's under
[30:28] contract
[30:29] a real estate agent is saying that
[30:32] doesn't mean that it's sold there's a
[30:34] lot of things that can go upside down
[30:36] between now and the time we actually
[30:37] close on it
[30:40] but because everything that has kind of
[30:42] happened in a lingering way there was
[30:44] some questions among some of the uh
[30:46] people in the fellowship was there
[30:48] something about the election because it
[30:51] was around the time of the election that
[30:53] I I wasn't in church for a while and so
[30:55] people were wondering could it be
[30:57] something to do with the election and I
[30:59] just want to assure you it had nothing
[31:00] to do with the election we Theresa and I
[31:03] both voted unanimously across the board
[31:06] I think we got the best deacons I think
[31:08] we've got the best song leaders we've
[31:10] got the best worship team for sure even
[31:12] though they're not even elected
[31:15] well let me take that back they were
[31:17] elected before the foundation of the
[31:18] world
[31:20] nobody can take that away
[31:22] and then it came up well did somebody
[31:25] say or do something and I just want to
[31:27] assure you nobody no you guys are the
[31:29] best you guys are the absolute best and
[31:32] we love y'all and I I have grown
[31:34] spiritually exponentially here in this
[31:36] assembly underneath this teaching and
[31:39] that was the one question I kept asking
[31:40] myself why why leave why leave I don't
[31:43] know I don't have the answer to that but
[31:46] we just Teresa and I are both feeling
[31:48] definitely led to do that so now because
[31:50] I made this uh a part of the prayer
[31:52] request this is my prayer request
[31:55] pray with us that if this is God's
[31:58] perfect will
[31:59] every door will open and will have a
[32:02] smooth transition
[32:04] and if it's not God's perfect will let
[32:07] every door close
[32:08] uh you know the the appraisal doesn't
[32:11] have to happen right the inspection can
[32:12] go wrong there's so many things they
[32:14] could even they could even just say you
[32:16] know we decided not to do it apparently
[32:18] there's a clause in the contract that up
[32:20] to March the 10th they can just withdraw
[32:22] and there's nothing that we can really
[32:23] say about it so so we've got a lot of
[32:26] options here we're the sons of God we're
[32:28] the daughters of God and God hears our
[32:30] prayers and we're just asking you all to
[32:32] pray with us so so let's pray for first
[32:35] for sister close because she's been very
[32:37] much in my heart I know it's been in all
[32:39] of our hearts and then for brother
[32:41] Charles and for all these other requests
[32:42] let's bow our heads Heavenly Father
[32:45] having made this known now to the church
[32:47] Lord God and it's not an easy thing for
[32:49] sister Teresa and I because we love
[32:51] these folks
[32:52] but Lord Jesus Christ we know that
[32:54] you're going to be here you're going to
[32:56] be with us because you're omnipresent
[32:57] and Lord God your peace will be with
[33:00] your children no matter where they're at
[33:02] even an alliance Den or Lord in a jail
[33:04] cell like Paul and Silas they could
[33:06] still have the joy of the Lord and we
[33:08] have the joy of the Lord in our heart we
[33:10] just ask your blessings now father and
[33:12] Lord God we ask your blessings on our
[33:14] precious sister of course the Lord God
[33:15] that you will will continue to minister
[33:18] in her mind because healing starts in
[33:21] the soul it comes with believing your
[33:23] word and denying every symptoms not
[33:27] looking to the ways and the in the in
[33:29] the torments of Satan but Lord God
[33:31] looking to the precious Promises of God
[33:34] and we pray within her soul lord they'll
[33:36] rise such a faith that there's nothing
[33:38] that Satan Can Do Lord God and Lord
[33:40] Jesus we just pray father that it'll
[33:42] manifest in her physical body Lord God
[33:45] the terrestrial body Lord Lord Jesus
[33:48] Christ we're just looking for that Lord
[33:50] and we're looking for the manifestation
[33:52] and and as the brothers said without a
[33:54] test there's not a testimony and we
[33:56] believe our precious sister will have a
[33:58] wonderful testimony we also want to
[34:00] continue to pray for brother Lamont and
[34:03] that moving ache and pain Lord God as
[34:06] our nervous system works Lord God
[34:08] sometimes it tweaks one way and tweaks
[34:10] another way but Lord you know where it's
[34:12] going to go before it leaves so we just
[34:14] pray that you'll continue to bless
[34:16] brother Lamont Lord Jesus and Lord for
[34:19] the need for the for the trailer Lord
[34:21] God the Father it's old and decrepit and
[34:24] it just needs to find its way out of
[34:26] here so give us a definite resolution to
[34:29] that and it seems like there was another
[34:32] request that I'm I'm not remembering but
[34:34] God knows what it is so may you bless
[34:36] that Lord God bless that need father and
[34:39] Lord Jesus we also want to ask you that
[34:41] you will bless the tithes and the
[34:43] offerings we ask Lord God that you bless
[34:46] those who have and those who have not to
[34:48] give we pray Lord God that you'll bless
[34:50] the minister father Lord let him get
[34:52] himself yourself out of the way give us
[34:54] ears to hear father and may we be
[34:56] attentive Lord as though it were you

[35:02] not a brother shimbo father Lord God we
[35:05] want to hear everything that you have
[35:06] for our souls Lord God Lord because
[35:09] faith comes by hearing and hearing the

[1:03:36] direction to reach that lamb let it be

[1:03:42] cost the time is almost closing the
[1:03:45] gentle door is almost finished let's
[1:03:47] reach out to that Soul that's why he's

[1:04:24] richly bless you for everything
[1:04:27] we did a lot of work and he helped me I
[1:04:30] could not make it but he gave me time to
[1:04:32] go see a family in this church and also
[1:04:34] to sleep up in the hospital to be able
[1:04:36] to be with sistako so everything you do
[1:04:39] in here you're actually giving me more
[1:04:41] freedom to do what I have to do and to
[1:04:43] attend to everybody so God richly bless
[1:04:46] you everybody that was here for the
[1:04:48] sacrifice to help move or transfer the
[1:04:51] things from the old trailer to the new
[1:04:53] one we really really appreciate it God
[1:04:55] richly bless you amen
[1:04:58] uh question and answer is coming up on
[1:05:01] March 18th and the time uh it's already
[1:05:04] 2 30 but the the place brother Kelly
[1:05:07] will let me know if the our secret place
[1:05:11] is already open if it's not open yet so
[1:05:14] we know we might have to meet again here
[1:05:16] in church amen
[1:05:18] amen okay let me start this way how many
[1:05:21] are up to date with the sermon let me
[1:05:23] see your hand I can't sleep that one
[1:05:27] praise be to the name of the Lord
[1:05:31] how many are reading their Cod book
[1:05:35] okay how many are reading their Church
[1:05:37] ages I have a young man who finished the
[1:05:39] church age completely but I don't want
[1:05:41] to call it his name because the devil
[1:05:43] will attack him so I need to protect him
[1:05:46] amen
[1:05:48] amen glory to God everything will be
[1:05:50] okay
[1:05:51] the reason why I'm asking this
[1:05:54] I don't know if you notice every time we
[1:05:56] preach every sermon is building on top
[1:05:59] of the other
[1:06:01] have you noticed that so if you miss one
[1:06:04] or two or five you're gonna find
[1:06:06] yourself asking question of the things
[1:06:09] that we already went through
[1:06:11] amen amen so when I'm asking I'm asking
[1:06:14] without humility I just want to see
[1:06:16] where you are and if there is anything I
[1:06:18] need to do so I know what to do amen but
[1:06:21] I will encourage you because usually we
[1:06:23] got three groups of people in the church
[1:06:30] everybody okay there is a group of
[1:06:33] people that will listen to the word
[1:06:35] and they will go home
[1:06:37] and they will review again
[1:06:40] the word
[1:06:41] that the group that will catch many
[1:06:44] things that you thought you caught in
[1:06:47] the sermon but the Holy Spirit Will
[1:06:49] minister to you over again
[1:06:52] and show you a lot of stuff and
[1:06:54] establish you more because brother
[1:06:56] Branham say the holy spirit is the
[1:06:58] inside teacher everybody okay but there
[1:07:01] is another group that usually listen to
[1:07:03] the word and when they leave that's it
[1:07:06] they're not going to come back if they
[1:07:09] went to the bathroom or they went on the
[1:07:10] phone they don't even care about the
[1:07:12] five minute that they lost they just go
[1:07:14] and that's it amen and there is another
[1:07:17] group that doesn't even care
[1:07:20] amen if they missed five Services 10
[1:07:23] Services it doesn't matter they won't go
[1:07:25] back again and say no I missed the ones
[1:07:27] the service let me catch up on Wednesday
[1:07:28] so I can get there amen so my
[1:07:31] encouragement is for all of you to be in
[1:07:34] group one
[1:07:35] be people that go back and review sermon
[1:07:39] I can give you brother Brandon's sermon
[1:07:41] you can listen to it and I can give it
[1:07:43] to you you listen the second time you're
[1:07:44] going to hear something different
[1:07:46] it doesn't mean you didn't listen to
[1:07:48] brother Brown you can read the scripture
[1:07:50] the Bible I read the Bible the first
[1:07:52] time I finished it all I went again the
[1:07:54] second time and every time I'm going
[1:07:56] back again I keep seeing things new it
[1:07:59] doesn't mean I didn't read the Bible
[1:08:01] amen but the holy spirit is so great
[1:08:04] that always give for Yemen give time to
[1:08:08] consecrate yourself and go back and
[1:08:10] review things everybody okay
[1:08:13] glory be to God Amen
[1:08:16] I was contacted this is the second time
[1:08:18] by a minister from uh
[1:08:21] from overseas from Ghana they had a
[1:08:25] trouble
[1:08:25] with the drum in the church
[1:08:31] it's just trouble amen some people say
[1:08:35] they should not play drama in a church
[1:08:38] some say they should play drama in a
[1:08:40] church and the God is split in the
[1:08:42] country
[1:08:45] and some got to the point where if they
[1:08:48] come to your church and you're playing
[1:08:49] drums the people will just leave and go
[1:08:51] out
[1:08:52] I don't know where people are coming
[1:08:54] from
[1:08:57] I don't know where they're getting this

[1:13:21] Jeremiah 1 verse 4.
[1:13:25] then the word of the Lord came to me
[1:13:28] saying
[1:13:30] you see where I'm going
[1:13:33] before I form you in the belly a water a
[1:13:38] new day

[1:15:20] as much as the dear to us
[1:15:23] they didn't create us
[1:15:27] God only picked them
[1:15:30] and say this one and this one and this
[1:15:33] one you take this chance

[1:44:15] we okay
[1:44:17] I told you it's a very difficult things
[1:44:20] it's a problem in the message so I want
[1:44:23] you to really pay attention
[1:44:24] what is the problem
[1:44:27] what is going on pastor why are we
[1:44:30] approaching it this way
[1:44:32] which year is this 57. in 1957 in which
[1:44:37] matter
[1:44:39] August in 1957 in August brother Branham
[1:44:44] make a statement
[1:44:45] what is the statement brother Branham is
[1:44:48] making
[1:44:49] brother Branham say when a man becoming
[1:44:52] that body he had control over all the
[1:44:55] water fishes all the water files and the
[1:44:58] Beast of the word feel and then there
[1:45:00] was no man to till the water which man
[1:45:03] is he talking about
[1:45:05] what is his name
[1:45:07] thank you he's talking about who I don't
[1:45:10] know brother Branham is talking about
[1:45:12] Adam Adam in Genesis 1 26 because that
[1:45:16] is where God told him that uh uh he give
[1:45:20] him dominion over the fishes and
[1:45:22] everything you know that
[1:45:24] now brother Branham goes in Genesis 2 he
[1:45:27] say he don't made male and female you
[1:45:30] know that but there was no man to kill
[1:45:33] the soul then God made Man Out of the
[1:45:35] Dust of the what if you know who he's
[1:45:38] talking about he gives him a hand like a
[1:45:41] chimpanzee
[1:45:48] am I reading something different
[1:45:51] it doesn't mean that we are chimpanzee
[1:45:54] he looked like if you go see a
[1:45:57] chimpanzee he looked like a human hand
[1:46:00] that's what brother brother want to say
[1:46:02] everybody okay he give him a foot like
[1:46:05] water it doesn't mean that like our feet
[1:46:08] is like a bear a bear has a foot with
[1:46:12] toes with nail we have a foot with toe
[1:46:15] with nail everybody okay
[1:46:17] brother Barnum said he gives him he made
[1:46:20] him on the image and this Earthly body
[1:46:23] right here natural is in the image of
[1:46:27] what animal life and it's made out of
[1:46:29] the same kind of water material your
[1:46:31] body is made just the same kind of
[1:46:34] material as a what horse
[1:46:38] you go to the Book of Genesis the Bible
[1:46:41] said God made the beast from the dust of
[1:46:44] the ground it is written in Genesis we
[1:46:46] already went through that everybody okay
[1:46:48] it looks like a dog
[1:46:51] or anything like that it is made out of
[1:46:54] calcium
[1:46:56] petroleum Cosmic light everybody okay
[1:46:59] All Flesh like that is not the same
[1:47:02] flesh that is First Corinthians 15 39
[1:47:05] remember that for those who read it it
[1:47:08] is a different flesh because Paul said
[1:47:10] there is a flesh for the fish for the
[1:47:12] human for the bird and things it's in
[1:47:14] First Corinthians 15 39. but I'm saying
[1:47:18] it's a different flesh but it's made out
[1:47:20] of the Dust of the Earth where we come
[1:47:23] water from
[1:47:24] Follow Me Now carefully
[1:47:27] but brother Branham is comparing men and
[1:47:32] animal
[1:47:33] everybody okay he's picking up the human
[1:47:36] being and the animal he says body wise
[1:47:39] we all came from the dust of the earth
[1:47:41] we're coming from the same material yes
[1:47:43] now brother Branham say butter the
[1:47:46] difference between anonymous
[1:47:49] everybody okay
[1:47:51] God put a song
[1:47:55] in air man
[1:47:58] everybody okay that's why the Bible says
[1:48:01] there were eight Souls
[1:48:04] thou herself in the days of Noah
[1:48:07] everybody okay because Noah and his wife
[1:48:11] too
[1:48:12] Noah had three children and their wife
[1:48:15] how many
[1:48:17] six plus two equal hey everybody okay
[1:48:20] but they were animals in the ark they
[1:48:23] were bird in the ark but God said God
[1:48:26] save what age so in other words when God
[1:48:29] was going inside the earth when God was
[1:48:32] checking the ark when he looked at the
[1:48:35] cheetah no soul he looked at the
[1:48:37] elephant no so he goes to Noah he say
[1:48:40] one Noah's wife to him
[1:48:48] their three wives
[1:48:50] because animals don't have soul
[1:48:54] did I lost anybody
[1:48:57] keep quiet I'm gonna climb more
[1:48:59] brother Branham say God put a soul in a
[1:49:03] man and he didn't put it in the water
[1:49:05] anymore brother Bradham is comparing man
[1:49:07] we felt not anymore he said because
[1:49:14] they saw
[1:49:16] that was in the man is that water the
[1:49:19] alphaneate
[1:49:23] [Applause]
[1:49:28] according to brother Branham in 57 the
[1:49:33] soul of a man brother Branham called
[1:49:36] that a water yeah
[1:49:40] so
[1:49:42] beautiful
[1:49:46] that's why I told you to stay put
[1:49:49] because this have split the message
[1:49:53] into camper
[1:49:57] are you okay
[1:49:59] and those two camp this Camp have big
[1:50:01] preachers
[1:50:03] none this Camp also has big preacher no
[1:50:08] everybody okay
[1:50:10] and the guy preacher that if he said one
[1:50:12] thing or the preacher behind him will
[1:50:14] repeat the same thing nobody will
[1:50:16] challenge you
[1:50:19] I am in need the camp
[1:50:24] [Applause]
[1:50:25] everybody okay
[1:50:27] I am nobody
[1:50:30] I don't know anything
[1:50:33] but I know the author of this message
[1:50:36] [Applause]
[1:50:41] everybody okay what is the problem with
[1:50:45] this brother Stephen because last Sunday
[1:50:47] we found out that a theophany is a body
[1:50:52] amen we have two body we have a natural
[1:50:56] body and we have a spiritual body and
[1:50:59] when we come we come from our father in
[1:51:01] The Natural Body and when we die this is
[1:51:05] when we enter our water our theophany
[1:51:08] and the glorified body is the Natural
[1:51:11] Body plus the water everybody okay so
[1:51:15] far so how can a body be a soul
[1:51:24] preach the confusion is not with the
[1:51:28] message
[1:51:31] the confusion is in the preachers
[1:51:34] [Music]
[1:51:36] and the congregation
[1:51:40] I was informed that people came up with
[1:51:43] a crazy devilish I are up
[1:51:47] where they are showing the contradiction
[1:51:50] of brother Brown
[1:51:54] and the person to whom they talk turn
[1:51:57] around he was actually a sister say the
[1:52:00] same thing can be done to the Bible
[1:52:05] I have scripture that I can give you
[1:52:07] right now this scriptures say David is
[1:52:09] number eight this one said David is
[1:52:12] number seven I have a bunch of them like
[1:52:14] that there is no contradiction in the
[1:52:16] Bible
[1:52:20] the contradiction is with us
[1:52:23] with our small bird brain
[1:52:33] everybody okay there is no confusion in
[1:52:36] the message
[1:52:37] come on
[1:52:39] if you don't understand something chill
[1:52:42] out
[1:52:42] [Applause]
[1:52:44] just leave it alone let somebody another
[1:52:47] preacher will come and God will give him
[1:52:50] the inspiration and he will preach and
[1:52:52] we will only join
[1:52:55] [Applause]
[1:52:59] now we get a cap that says that your
[1:53:02] family of Adam Adam has his theophany
[1:53:08] they are right they're reading the court
[1:53:12] and there is another kept they say no
[1:53:16] the cap that are saying no
[1:53:19] where are they coming from
[1:53:21] why do they say no do they have another
[1:53:24] Court
[1:53:28] are we are you following me that is
[1:53:30] contradicting this one
[1:53:32] in their brain
[1:53:38] William Marion brother
[1:53:41] in 19 water
[1:53:45] in 1965 let's go slowly my friend I told
[1:53:49] you I'm trying to save you a big
[1:53:52] headache in this message because this is
[1:53:56] the Earth the origin of the big
[1:53:59] confusion in the baptism of the Holy
[1:54:01] Spirit
[1:54:03] and you will see it sooner
[1:54:05] in 1965
[1:54:10] after the opening of this
[1:54:16] everybody okay in other words the second
[1:54:19] oil have come up
[1:54:21] and the second all broke the seals and
[1:54:25] the World opened up big enough
[1:54:28] make a statement
[1:54:32] stop brother Stephen so you want to say
[1:54:35] that brother Branham after the seals
[1:54:39] contradict brother Ibraham before the
[1:54:42] series no
[1:54:44] so when you put this on your Tick Tock

[1:54:50] off put everything I spoke
[1:54:52] everybody okay no
[1:54:55] it was an oil
[1:54:57] and the other one was an oil but the
[1:55:00] second one is powerful
[1:55:02] we already went through that
[1:55:04] everybody okay what is he saying after
[1:55:08] the seals William Marion brother he says
[1:55:12] the difference between him and who you
[1:55:15] he's talking about Jesus Christ as a
[1:55:18] water son you are a son Jesus was his
[1:55:21] son but there is a difference between
[1:55:23] you and Jesus
[1:55:25] there is a difference between you and
[1:55:27] Jesus
[1:55:29] the difference between you and him as a
[1:55:32] son he was at the beginning the what

[1:55:46] in the person of Hope then later we
[1:55:50] never heard of who no more Mexican let's
[1:55:53] go slowly
[1:55:57] we know that in the beginning there was
[1:55:59] a spirit
[1:56:00] everybody okay then the spirit move into
[1:56:03] the world
[1:56:05] which is Christos which is melchizede
[1:56:08] which is the logos which is the pillar
[1:56:11] of I which is the theophany everybody
[1:56:14] good and then the word was made
[1:56:17] this church everybody okay
[1:56:20] now let's go he says he came in and live
[1:56:24] in that in the world in the in the
[1:56:28] person of who what melchized then later
[1:56:30] on we never heard no more of who milk is
[1:56:33] selling because he became hope Jesus
[1:56:36] Christ
[1:56:37] we already understand this
[1:56:39] Melchizedek was the priest but he became
[1:56:43] hope Jesus Christ now you did what

[1:59:39] they saw that was in Adam was what
[1:59:46] yeah we okay now
[1:59:48] he said you come like who Adam like who
[1:59:51] me you become from water attributes to
[1:59:55] water flesh to be water tempted
[1:59:58] according to 1965 Adam
[2:00:03] bypass
[2:00:05] his theophany
[2:00:10] how many cups do we have now
[2:00:13] to Camp one say Adam has a water
[2:00:17] and now they say Adam did water
[2:00:20] and this one is saying this is after the
[2:00:22] opening of these Hills
[2:00:28] let me relax you both of them are right
[2:00:32] [Music]
[2:00:34] both of those quotes
[2:00:38] amen everybody okay
[2:00:40] second coat
[2:00:41] for paragraph 79 second Corinthians 5 1
[2:00:45] if this Earthly body be what dissolved
[2:00:48] this every Tabernacle we have a water
[2:00:50] another one that another one is called
[2:00:52] water
[2:00:53] to your funny see we bypass that to come
[2:00:58] straight from God the attribute to what
[2:01:00] flesh to be tempted and tested by what
[2:01:03] sin like who Adam did
[2:01:09] so in 1957 Adam his soul was a theophany
[2:01:14] in 1965 brother Branham say Adam
[2:01:17] bypasses theophany
[2:01:20] in other words Adam saw didn't have the
[2:01:24] theophany
[2:01:28] brother Stephen
[2:01:30] don't choke me I want my friend
[2:01:33] everybody okay
[2:01:35] before we move forward
[2:01:38] we need to find out how was Adam created
[2:01:45] and when Adam was created he looked like
[2:01:48] who
[2:01:50] because the Bible says that man Adam was
[2:01:54] created in the image and the likeness of
[2:01:57] who God so we need to know how was God
[2:02:00] when he created Adam he was like what
[2:02:07] everybody okay everybody good brother
[2:02:10] Branham says here that that Pillar of
[2:02:13] Fire right there the logos that went out
[2:02:16] of who God the logos which is actually
[2:02:19] the what attributes of the water
[2:02:21] fullness of God
[2:02:25] the logos
[2:02:27] is the attribute of the fullness of God
[2:02:30] it's an attribute
[2:02:34] everybody okay
[2:02:36] when God became into a form to where he
[2:02:40] could be water seen he was the anointing
[2:02:44] of the great spirit that did what went
[2:02:46] forth it is what God doing what
[2:02:48] condescending coming water down down the
[2:02:51] father and then the what logos that was
[2:02:54] up over Israel he was holy could not be
[2:02:58] what to sin so according to brother
[2:03:00] Branham when God moved here and moved to
[2:03:04] this place God became the logos
[2:03:07] everybody okay
[2:03:08] this logos is called the theophany
[2:03:11] everybody okay and this place here is
[2:03:15] what we call the beginning
[2:03:20] everybody okay we call this the
[2:03:23] beginning everybody okay in the
[2:03:26] beginning we're talking about the logos
[2:03:28] in the beginning was the word
[2:03:32] and the Word was with God
[2:03:36] so before the word was here the word was
[2:03:40] first here
[2:03:45] everybody okay
[2:03:47] this word and this word look alike
[2:03:54] everybody okay but this word here is in
[2:03:58] the form called the attribute
[2:04:05] everybody okay
[2:04:06] let's leave it ready we okay in the
[2:04:10] beginning what's the water and the Word
[2:04:13] was with what God and the Word was God
[2:04:16] and the Word was made flesh
[2:04:20] everybody okay so far now what is what
[2:04:24] happened in the beginning brother the
[2:04:26] Bible says this
[2:04:28] glory to God in first Timothy 6 verse 14
[2:04:33] that you keep this commandment without
[2:04:36] words are rebukable until the appearing
[2:04:39] of Our Lord what Jesus Christ we need to
[2:04:41] know how is that Jesus Christ is it the
[2:04:44] word or is it
[2:04:46] which in his time he shall show who is
[2:04:50] the blessed and the only water
[2:04:52] the king of water Kings and the Lord of
[2:04:55] what Lord who only has water immortality
[2:04:58] dwelling in the light so this man here
[2:05:03] called the word call the logos call
[2:05:07] theophany call Chris Christians call the
[2:05:10] pillar of fire he is immortal
[2:05:16] everybody good and he dwell in a light
[2:05:21] everybody okay so the word is
[2:05:24] enlightened
[2:05:27] amen yes
[2:05:31] everybody okay the word is a light and
[2:05:35] that word is immortal
[2:05:37] are we okay so far dwelling in the light
[2:05:40] which no man can approach unto
[2:05:43] whom no man has seen nor can see to whom
[2:05:46] be on or in power Everlasting water Amen
[2:05:49] Let me see again that God the way he
[2:05:52] looks at the beginning the Bible say in
[2:05:55] Psalm 104 blessed the Lord O My Soul oh
[2:06:00] Lord my God that are very great there
[2:06:03] are clothed with honor and water Majesty
[2:06:05] who covered thyself with what light as a
[2:06:09] water government
[2:06:11] everybody okay everybody okay the word
[2:06:15] is a light
[2:06:16] it's a garment
[2:06:20] amen
[2:06:21] it is a covering
[2:06:24] everybody okay
[2:06:26] who stretches out the heaven like a
[2:06:28] curtain
[2:06:30] get ready now
[2:06:31] this first John 1 5
[2:06:34] is the this then is the message which we
[2:06:38] have heard of what him and declare unto
[2:06:41] you what is the message that God is what
[2:06:44] life
[2:06:47] everybody okay God is what life God is
[2:06:52] what logos God is water God is what
[2:06:55] Christ God is what God is what
[2:07:00] everybody okay where are you going
[2:07:03] Pastor now we have established that the
[2:07:07] beginning the God that was in the
[2:07:09] beginning was the light
[2:07:11] he looked like this
[2:07:14] everybody okay everybody okay so if he's
[2:07:18] creating Adam
[2:07:20] in his own water image and in his own
[2:07:23] word likeness how will Adam be
[2:07:28] are we okay
[2:07:30] glory to God James 1 verse 17 every good
[2:07:35] water give and every perfect water give
[2:07:38] Ariana is from a watch above
[2:07:41] everybody okay and cometh down from the
[2:07:44] water father of water light stop
[2:07:49] he's the father of what lights so he's
[2:07:53] the one that gives birth
[2:07:55] [Applause]
[2:08:06] not only one right but many lights
[2:08:10] [Applause]
[2:08:14] everybody okay that's why on the day of
[2:08:17] premikos
[2:08:19] when the pillar of fire came down the
[2:08:23] pillar of fire divided himself
[2:08:26] in many lights
[2:08:31] everybody okay so when God the Father
[2:08:35] God the light give birth what did he
[2:08:39] give birth to his air light and Adam is
[2:08:43] a son of God
[2:08:45] [Applause]
[2:08:49] if you go to the Book of Luke chapter 3
[2:08:53] you will see they tell you Isaac the son
[2:08:56] of Abraham Abraham the son of this and
[2:08:59] then he goes all the way to Able set set
[2:09:02] then Adam when he reached Adam Adam
[2:09:04] didn't have a father
[2:09:07] Adam didn't have a mama
[2:09:10] the Bible say Adam the what
[2:09:13] the Son of God how can God give a son
[2:09:17] where is the wife of God
[2:09:22] everybody okay how did he create Adam
[2:09:24] amen so when the father is the father of
[2:09:29] what right so when God created he create
[2:09:32] what life if he created Adam Adam must
[2:09:36] be how
[2:09:41] glory to God Amen
[2:09:44] are we okay have I lost someone
[2:09:49] 1964. when he met Adam that first man
[2:09:53] how perfect he was
[2:09:55] he looked like hook God
[2:10:01] the Great Water Holy Spirit brooding
[2:10:04] over the Earth
[2:10:06] the birds did what come out maybe and
[2:10:09] then the water animals and what
[2:10:11] different things and he kept on coming
[2:10:13] more in the form of the one that was
[2:10:17] what in other words when God was
[2:10:20] creating bird create animal create a
[2:10:23] giraffe create he was approaching
[2:10:25] towards something that looked like him
[2:10:30] just
[2:10:39] just water exactly like the one that was
[2:10:43] doing the water running exactly like who
[2:10:46] God God was a man was made in the image
[2:10:50] of water God so Adam looked like God
[2:10:54] [Applause]
[2:10:57] everybody okay so Adam at the beginning
[2:11:00] was in the form of a tea of honey but
[2:11:05] how come after the opening of the seals
[2:11:08] brother Branham say he bypasses the to
[2:11:10] your father
[2:11:13] everybody okay
[2:11:15] glory to God
[2:11:18] Hallelujah you there
[2:11:20] now we were first in 1957 which month

[2:11:38] so when brother made this statement two
[2:11:41] months later he made another statement
[2:11:44] what did he say
[2:11:50] and as he walked through the Water
[2:11:54] Garden of Eden he's talking about who
[2:11:57] first as a water the alphony
[2:12:03] everybody okay the man of Genesis 1 26
[2:12:07] was a theophany
[2:12:10] he was a light

[2:12:31] subdue
[2:12:33] but he could not till the water Genesis
[2:12:36] 2 7. so God put him in the flesh so that
[2:12:40] he can do it seal the soil give him
[2:12:42] water five senses to till the water to
[2:12:45] fix water and so forth and then men look

[2:13:24] he what and what a female
[2:13:28] because God himself is male and what
[2:13:31] female so when Adam was in theophany he

[2:25:37] in First Corinth and say that when this
[2:25:41] corruption

[2:44:49] amen another word your theophany is a
[2:44:55] duplicate
[2:44:58] of your predestinated seed
[2:45:06] everybody okay everybody okay so when

[2:45:18] everybody okay everybody okay yourself
[2:45:23] resemble
[2:45:26] your honey
[2:45:32] everybody okay that's why when you die
[2:45:35] you won't take anybody else to your

[2:45:44] that look like you
[2:45:48] how did he look like you
[2:45:50] where did he get your phone
[2:45:53] from your mother because some people die
[2:45:55] as a baby Sharon Rose die as a baby but
[2:45:59] when brother Branham saw Sharon Rose she
[2:46:01] was an adult lady where was that picture
[2:46:04] of her dog taken from

[2:46:11] but in heaven she was a grown-up woman
[2:46:14] that grown-up woman that ship that body
[2:46:18] where did God get it because in the
[2:46:21] earth we didn't see that that body
[2:46:23] already existed
[2:46:28] he was first I thought
[2:46:32] Francis seed inside of God then God look
[2:46:37] at you inside and make a copy of you
[2:46:40] call your theophany
[2:46:43] and your body here will only follow the
[2:46:46] shape of your theophany which is the
[2:46:50] shape of the real you
[2:46:53] amen
[2:46:55] everybody okay
[2:46:56] so when God is baptizing you with the
[2:47:00] Holy Ghost
[2:47:03] amen
[2:47:05] amen everybody okay the Ark of the
[2:47:08] Covenant has the Throne of God if you
[2:47:11] take the ark out of the Tabernacle God
[2:47:15] doesn't have any more seat
[2:47:21] that's why when the ark was taken out
[2:47:24] from Israel the Bible call it a cupboard
[2:47:28] because the glory of the Lord has water
[2:47:31] it was not really God that left out but
[2:47:34] the throne
[2:47:36] of God was taken out so when God comes
[2:47:39] in the Tabernacle he cannot he doesn't
[2:47:42] have any seat
[2:47:44] everybody okay he will walk around walk
[2:47:47] around and go
[2:47:52] I don't know if you get me
[2:47:54] God get into other people's life
[2:47:59] and God can walk in the flesh
[2:48:05] God can work in the spirit
[2:48:08] when God can get in the soul but when
[2:48:12] God gets in the soul he does a family
[2:48:14] seat
[2:48:16] you follow me when there is no seat God
[2:48:19] say all this is not my child God get out
[2:48:24] [Music]
[2:48:26] everybody okay but if it is a
[2:48:29] predestinated
[2:48:32] and he was putting yourself when you
[2:48:35] begin to feel cold chills the anointing
[2:48:38] of God
[2:48:40] hold on
[2:48:41] he's just entering the Tabernacle let
[2:48:45] him move from the body into the spirit
[2:48:49] when he move in the spirit you begin to
[2:48:52] speak in tongues
[2:48:55] let him do what he's doing he's gonna
[2:48:58] move from the spirit and he entered the
[2:49:01] soul when he entered the song he's
[2:49:04] looking for his chair
[2:49:06] everybody okay when he see the
[2:49:09] predestined the thing he said press the
[2:49:12] Lord
[2:49:13] is my turn
[2:49:14] [Applause]
[2:49:20] with the Holy Spirit you are sealed with
[2:49:23] the Holy Spirit
[2:49:24] [Applause]
[2:49:34] that's why brother Branham said in North
[2:49:37] seed there is nothing to Quicken
[2:49:43] the baptism of the Holy Ghost is God
[2:49:46] looking for his seed
[2:49:49] it is not you God doesn't care about
[2:49:52] your head he's looking at the seed as
[2:49:56] love as he sees the seed God's job
[2:50:00] and he seals you

[2:52:04] he can give you the anointing but after
[2:52:07] a while he will go away then you become
[2:52:10] anointed one of the end time
[2:52:14] but if you are seed of God

[2:52:35] right
[2:52:35] [Applause]
[2:52:45] your predestinated seed is your
[2:52:49] identification it is your DNA
[2:52:52] [Applause]
[2:52:57] when God sees that
[2:53:01] it doesn't matter if you were born of a
[2:53:04] prostitute
[2:53:05] [Applause]
[2:53:10] even if you don't know your biological
[2:53:12] father that's not the problem
[2:53:15] Marquis said that is your father
[2:53:18] he put the seed in you before the
[2:53:21] foundation of the world
[2:53:31] the China he choose for you to come has
[2:53:34] nothing to do with you

[2:53:45] and I stop here
[2:53:48] [Applause]
[2:53:56] I am in 25 percent
[2:54:00] of the sermon
[2:54:04] all these quotes were given to me like
[2:54:07] within the last three days
[2:54:09] and it took everything that I have last
[2:54:11] week and push it back
[2:54:13] but I can't even move forward
[2:54:15] let's go to first king chapter 14.
[2:54:19] I'm going to stop here
[2:54:26] the soul is the theophany
[2:54:29] it is not the actual tea of honey
[2:54:32] it is the theophany in seed form
[2:54:35] [Music]
[2:54:37] it is the Divine part of God
[2:54:41] because if God look at your spirit there
[2:54:44] is trouble if you look at your soul
[2:54:46] there is trouble if you look at your
[2:54:48] flesh you got tattoo and everything but
[2:54:51] the devil can put tattoo on your body he
[2:54:55] can tattoo your mind
[2:54:56] with bad things that you did in the past
[2:54:59] but he cannot tattoo the predestinated
[2:55:03] [Applause]

[2:55:08] where brother Branham say as that
[2:55:10] predestined they see this what we move

[2:55:31] what is the baptism of the Holy Spirit
[2:55:37] there is something really even stronger
[2:55:40] than what you're thinking now
[2:55:43] when you have a seed
[2:55:45] what is inside the seed
[2:55:48] what is inside the seed
[2:55:53] okay if it's a seed of God what kind of
[2:55:57] life is in the sea

[2:56:13] where did you get eternal life
[2:56:15] do you see how people are confused
[2:56:18] let's chill out let's go to first king
[2:56:21] verse 14 chapter 14. at that time who
[2:56:26] abhija the son of who you know jeroboam
[2:56:30] was a bad man
[2:56:31] in the Bible everybody knows that if you
[2:56:34] don't know review that at home because I

[2:58:01] could not what see for he his eyes were
[2:58:04] set by reason of water Elijah was not

[3:00:23] People Israel when the kingdom was split
[3:00:25] they took it from Solomon and gave it to
[3:00:27] him and he messed up and went the
[3:00:30] kingdom away from the house of David and
[3:00:33] give it to you and yet you have not been

[3:00:46] above all that were before you for you
[3:00:50] have gone and made you other God and
[3:00:53] molten image to provoke me to anger and
[3:00:56] to cast me behind your back therefore
[3:00:58] follow me carefully behold I will bring

[3:07:35] your funny
[3:07:39] let me stop here let's pray Heavenly
[3:07:43] Father
[3:07:44] Lord we are approaching you humbly again
[3:07:49] father this afternoon
[3:07:51] Lord thanking you for your grace
[3:07:55] for your love
[3:07:57] and for your mercy
[3:08:01] father thank you for predestination
[3:08:05] thank you for the Eternal seed of God
[3:08:08] because now we begin to understand who
[3:08:12] we are
[3:08:15] that's why certain things
[3:08:18] that other kid did
[3:08:20] could not feed us
[3:08:23] that's why you bypass
[3:08:27] the condition of the woman at the well
[3:08:31] there were many women that were more
[3:08:33] righteous than her
[3:08:35] but you didn't look at the righteousness
[3:08:37] of men
[3:08:40] even though she changes husband
[3:08:44] you met her with six husbands
[3:08:47] that didn't block you
[3:08:50] you were already determined to go to
[3:08:53] Jerusalem
[3:08:54] to finish your trip
[3:08:58] but there was enlightened
[3:09:00] that was flashing somewhere
[3:09:04] there was a predestinated seat that was
[3:09:07] calling out somewhere
[3:09:09] and you told your disciple
[3:09:12] that
[3:09:13] there is a need
[3:09:15] that I must go by Samaria
[3:09:18] why you told us you will go into
[3:09:21] Jerusalem why are you changing
[3:09:23] destination
[3:09:25] what is in Samaria
[3:09:29] there was a seed there
[3:09:31] that was calling
[3:09:38] father
[3:09:41] many things happen in our life that we
[3:09:44] don't even understand why
[3:09:48] we hated ourselves
[3:09:50] we hated our fathers
[3:09:53] we hated our family member
[3:09:56] who treated us bad
[3:09:58] when everybody was going to the
[3:10:00] nightclub
[3:10:02] they didn't want me to go
[3:10:05] they left me home
[3:10:08] and I wanted to have fun like them
[3:10:12] but for some reason
[3:10:14] I was the outcast
[3:10:17] why was that treated like that
[3:10:23] why did I ever never fit
[3:10:26] even though I try I try but every time I
[3:10:30] go back I feel myself miserable
[3:10:33] I feel my life miserable
[3:10:36] I thought what they call the world have
[3:10:39] enjoyment
[3:10:41] but every time I do it
[3:10:43] I feel condemned in myself
[3:10:46] after watching pornography
[3:10:49] I feel condemned
[3:10:52] after going out with the boys I feel
[3:10:55] condemned I feel a shame of myself
[3:10:58] sometimes I feel like I need to take my
[3:11:01] life off
[3:11:04] what is going on with me
[3:11:08] it is the predestinated city
[3:11:13] it is the real me
[3:11:16] it is the identification
[3:11:19] it is the DNA
[3:11:22] because without that
[3:11:24] we could have been lost
[3:11:26] but you told
[3:11:28] your disciple that all that the father
[3:11:30] have given me I have lost none of them
[3:11:37] father help the church
[3:11:40] catch this revelation
[3:11:42] help us realize Who We Are
[3:11:50] so that we can let everything go
[3:11:53] and surrender to that which
[3:11:56] will nurture
[3:11:58] and let grow
[3:11:59] that seed that in Israel that is in US
[3:12:04] father May the Holy Spirit continue to
[3:12:07] minister to your children as they will
[3:12:10] review
[3:12:11] may you take them in deeper death
[3:12:14] so that they can see
[3:12:17] this child of jeroboam never even reach
[3:12:20] a grown-up
[3:12:21] age
[3:12:23] but he was taken out right there
[3:12:27] no one that the other Thief at the cross
[3:12:29] could turn around and say we did bad but
[3:12:33] not this man
[3:12:35] what makes him
[3:12:37] reckon us he's wrong
[3:12:42] and he cried out he said
[3:12:45] Lord
[3:12:46] remember me
[3:12:48] father he was not him that was crying
[3:12:54] he was the seed
[3:12:57] he was the word
[3:12:59] that was giving you the last signal
[3:13:03] that looked deep
[3:13:04] before you lose your breath of life
[3:13:07] do you want to leave me this way
[3:13:10] and as soon as you look at him
[3:13:13] you forgot that he needed to get
[3:13:15] baptized
[3:13:19] you bypass what a baptism
[3:13:23] you bypass some of your requirements
[3:13:26] yourself
[3:13:27] you said this day not even tomorrow you
[3:13:31] didn't call the disciple to come and
[3:13:34] show him how to repent
[3:13:36] right there you took him
[3:13:40] because in him
[3:13:43] was found something
[3:13:45] that was eternal with you
[3:13:53] father May your children focus on that
[3:13:59] I commit them unto their hand Lord
[3:14:03] in Jesus preciousness
[3:14:06] Hallelujah
[3:14:07] God bless you Church
[3:14:10] we love you
[3:14:11] we prepare for the word about this
[3:14:13] [Applause]
