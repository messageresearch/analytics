[29:45] the Lord bless you tonight let's read
[29:47] together here in Matthew uh 25 and we'll
[29:51] begin reading at the 14th verse familiar
[29:53] scripture Jesus teaching this Parable
[29:55] here amen uh Jesus taught a lot of
[29:58] things in a parable yes sir and uh this
[30:01] is a very powerful one that he mentions
[30:02] here the Bible says for the Kingdom of
[30:05] Heaven is as a man traveling into a far
[30:07] country who called his own servants and
[30:10] delivered unto them his goods and unto
[30:13] one he gave five talents to another two
[30:16] to another one to every man according to
[30:19] his several ability and straight way
[30:22] took his journey and then he had
[30:24] received the five talents sir went and
[30:26] traded the same
[30:28] and made them other five talents
[30:31] likewise he had received two he also
[30:33] gained other two but he that had
[30:36] received one talent I want you to notice
[30:38] this he that had received one went and
[30:40] died in the earth and hid his Lord's
[30:44] money amen and after a long time the
[30:46] Lord of those servants cometh and reckon
[30:48] with with them and so he that had
[30:51] received five talents came and brought
[30:53] other five talents saying Lord you gave
[30:55] unto me or thou deliver unto me five
[30:58] talents and behold I have gained beside
[31:00] them five talents more and his lord said
[31:03] unto him well done now good and faithful
[31:06] servant thou has been Faithful over a
[31:08] few things yes sir amen notice what the
[31:11] Lord wants us to do thou has been
[31:13] Faithful over a few things yes sir and I
[31:16] will make the ruler over many things see
[31:19] what the Lord's teaching us we've got to
[31:21] learn to be faithful over a little amen
[31:25] ain't that right we got to learn to be
[31:27] faithful over a
[31:28] little before we can a lot that's
[31:32] exactly what the scriptures teaching us
[31:35] here amen the one lost my place here you
[31:38] forgive
[31:40] me already already pulling you make it
[31:42] hard to read the
[31:44] Bible amen praise the Lord I gained two
[31:48] other talents beside them we'll just
[31:50] pick up in the 23rd verse as the Lord
[31:51] said to him well done good and faithful
[31:53] servant let's go down to the 24th and
[31:55] then he which had received the one
[31:57] Talent came and said Lord I knew thee
[32:00] that thou art an hard man and reaping
[32:03] where thou Hast not sown and Gathering
[32:05] where thou Hast not strawed and I was
[32:07] afraid amen ain't that something I was
[32:09] afraid and went and hid thy talent in
[32:12] the earth Lo there thou Hast that is
[32:16] thine his Lord answered and said to him
[32:18] thou Wicked and slothful servant thou
[32:22] knewest that I reap where I sld and
[32:24] gather where I have not
[32:26] stoed thou ought
[32:28] therefore to have put my money to the
[32:30] exchangers and then at my coming I
[32:33] should have received my own with ushery
[32:36] yes sir take therefore the talent from
[32:37] him and give it to him which hath 10
[32:40] talents for everyone that hath shall be
[32:43] given and he that hath abundance but
[32:46] from him that hath not shall be taken
[32:48] away that which he hath amen notice what
[32:52] a staggering scripture this is and cast
[32:54] ye the unprofitable servant into outer
[32:57] Darkness Darkness there shall be weeping
[33:00] and nashing of teeth me just a couple
[33:03] verses here in Ephesians 5 and 14
[33:06] wherefore he saith awake thou that
[33:08] sleepest and arise from the dead and
[33:10] Christ shall give thee light see then
[33:13] that ye walk circumspectly not as fools
[33:15] but as wise Redeeming the time because
[33:19] the days are evil wherefore be ye not
[33:21] unwise but understanding what the will
[33:24] of the Lord is amen we just ask the Lord
[33:26] to bless his word as you can be seated
[33:29] and uh tonight uh if I would take a
[33:30] subject I want to speak to you on redeem
[33:32] the time amen Redeeming the time and
[33:35] amen uh here in the scripture I find it
[33:38] amazing how Jesus would teach so many
[33:40] things in a parable yes sir and you know
[33:43] they would come to Jesus and ask him why
[33:45] do why do you do it this way why do you
[33:47] give us a parable this way but you'll
[33:49] find that there's normally such a very
[33:51] powerful message hidden behind a parable
[33:54] that's right and uh the Lord would many
[33:56] times give us powerful mess messages
[33:58] that are hidden behind the they and they
[34:00] came to him and said why don't you just
[34:01] speak to us plainly and sometimes Jesus
[34:04] would expound upon the pares and I I
[34:06] think this Parable that Jesus is giving
[34:09] is so powerful yes sir uh because he's
[34:12] telling us here that we are we are we
[34:14] are to be stewards with what God gives
[34:16] us and the one man he had a little bit
[34:20] and he went and he doubled it and then
[34:21] this man had some and then he went and
[34:24] he increased everything that uh that
[34:26] this lord gave him
[34:28] and then the other man he just took it
[34:30] and said well I was afraid I'd lose it
[34:31] all so I just went and buried it and and
[34:34] Jesus is giving us this here and and
[34:36] there's just so many Avenues you could
[34:38] approach it at and speak upon but I I
[34:41] think we need to look at the scripture
[34:42] for what it is because all of us will be
[34:45] held responsible for what God gives us
[34:48] and you say well well you know if I had
[34:50] a lot I'd do something with her no you
[34:52] wouldn't if God gave me a lot then I
[34:54] would do something no you wouldn't see
[34:57] amen God can give you a little let me
[34:59] just say this amen God can take a little
[35:02] and make a lot out of it if it's in his
[35:04] hands amen all of us we want to jump
[35:07] from here and jump to here but see God
[35:10] wants us to be amen ruler over a little
[35:14] amen ruler over a little that he could
[35:16] amen exalt us and make us ruler over you
[35:19] say well preacher you know if I had a
[35:22] lot I would be ruler if I had a lot I
[35:25] would do it if I just had the voice to
[35:27] sing or if I had the gift and I had this
[35:29] and I had you wouldn't do nothing with
[35:31] it amen listen friends it don't matter
[35:35] how much God would bless you because
[35:36] you're not using what God gave you amen
[35:40] God wants you to you listen I don't care
[35:42] if you can't carry a tune in a bucket
[35:45] amen use what God gave you I don't care
[35:48] if you're not the best singer in the
[35:49] church use what God gave you I don't
[35:52] care if you're the best preacher in the
[35:54] message just use what God gave
[35:56] you glory to God Amen it's not a
[36:00] competition is that right the house of
[36:02] God ain't a house of competition amen
[36:05] it's a bunch of people using what God
[36:07] gave us I say if you can sing then sing
[36:11] if you can worship then worship if all
[36:14] you can do is lift your hands and lift
[36:16] your hands amen whatever you're able to
[36:19] do amen just do what you can and stop
[36:23] making an excuse for not doing anything
[36:26] in the house
[36:29] God hallelujah redeem the time amen you
[36:32] know there's a testimony I I heard
[36:35] online and different preachers that
[36:36] preached about it but there was a man
[36:37] some some of y'all probably heard it but
[36:40] this man I believe he uh was in a
[36:42] wheelchair or wheelchair rid and he
[36:44] couldn't get up and couldn't walk and
[36:46] and so this man I think either crawled
[36:48] or every how he got down to the Altar
[36:49] and he got down to the Altar and some of
[36:51] y'all know the story got down to the
[36:53] Altar and begin to pray and and that
[36:55] Pastor he he he saw him he said man I
[36:58] want to I I wonder what that man's going
[36:59] to pray about he crawled out of his
[37:01] chair and just got all the way if there
[37:03] was a man that had an excuse to not be
[37:05] there it would have been that man if
[37:08] there was a man that had ex excuse to
[37:10] not be at that altar would have been
[37:11] that man and so the Pastor said well I'm
[37:14] going to get down and hear what he's got
[37:15] to say and that man knelt down and and
[37:18] he was in body and infirm in
[37:20] body and he got down there and he just
[37:22] began to say God you've been so good to
[37:26] me God you've been so good to me and
[37:31] that man thought H how in the world can
[37:33] he come down here and say that here's a
[37:36] man that barely got no legs and he can't
[37:38] walk and he's crippled but yet he's
[37:41] making his way to the altar just to give
[37:44] his part that he has unto the Lord amen
[37:48] listen I don't care how loud you are or
[37:51] how quiet you are you at least ought to
[37:54] be able to say God you've been so good
[37:57] to me preacher you don't know my
[38:00] problems but God has still been so good
[38:03] and well you don't know what God has
[38:05] brought me through but God has still
[38:08] been so good to me amen now if you
[38:11] didn't have breath in your body you
[38:12] might have an excuse but last I checked

[55:04] Bible says that we ought to be amen we
[55:06] ought to be swift to hear and slow to
[55:07] speak anden I just turn a corner in this
[55:10] but I believe we should redeem the time
[55:12] and hear the voice of the Lord you know
[55:14] Micaiah he he's a prophet there in the
[55:16] Old Testament very very powerful uh
[55:19] Prophet there in the scripture and you
[55:22] know they came to M y'all know the story
[55:24] in the Bible when Jehoshaphat was
[55:25] seeking the prophets and we got 400 and
[55:27] they said he said well do you have one
[55:29] more we got Micaiah but I hate him and
[55:31] you know Micaiah was such a an amazing
[55:34] Prophet here in the Bible because he he
[55:36] he comes and he says I'm only going to
[55:38] say what I hear the Lord say I'm not
[55:41] going to waste my time saying what you
[55:44] want me to say but I I'm Redeeming the
[55:47] time and I'm just going to speak what
[55:50] the Lord says I'm just going to speak
[55:54] what the Lord tells now that's a trueth
[55:57] Prophet it's a true Prophet when he
[55:59] waits on the Lord and hears what the
[56:02] Lord has to say that's who you want to
[56:05] listen to the man that will not tell you
[56:07] what you want to to hear but will tell
[56:10] you what you need to hear that's the man
[56:13] you ought to listen to that ain't always
[56:15] out to make you feel
[56:17] good let me just tell you God is more
[56:21] concerned of your character amen than he
[56:24] is your your
[56:26] comfortability he's not concerned about
[56:28] your comfort he's concerned about your
[56:33] character that's exactly the truth amen
[56:37] any god- calleded minister is not going
[56:38] to just say what he wants to say he he
[56:41] should be lay to the spirit of God and
[56:43] he should speak as the spirit speaks and
[56:46] we should hear as the spirit speaks to
[56:48] us exactly right and listen before
[56:50] something can be spoken we know the
[56:52] prophet taught us it starts out as a
[56:54] thought that's right right it starts out
[56:56] as a thought then you hear that and then
[56:59] you speak it see you're only able to
[57:01] speak it because you've heard it now I
[57:03] got a daughter back here and she she can
[57:05] say mama she can say Dad listen I I

[57:25] it all the time then she starts
[57:26] repeating what she's heard now just be H
[57:30] it took Dad a lot longer than Mama cuz
[57:32] Mama had a greater influence than daddy
[57:34] did cuz she's with her more amen and she
[57:37] learns that because it's all she hears
[57:40] amen now listen let me just say this you

[1:11:17] ability in studying this word and liting
[1:11:21] it through the scripture and seeing what
[1:11:23] the if they would have took all all of

[1:12:53] when you come to church redeem the time
[1:12:56] and the prophet told us here in the
[1:12:57] message his wers to perform he said see
[1:12:59] the reason we don't have spiritual
[1:13:03] blessings now the prophet says something
[1:13:05] like it gets my attention a little bit
[1:13:07] don't you the reason we don't have
[1:13:09] spiritual blessings he said we have too
[1:13:12] much time to watch television too much
[1:13:14] time to read newspapers or listen to
[1:13:16] something we should not be listening to
[1:13:19] he says and we are not Redeeming the
[1:13:21] time but we're giving it to the things
[1:13:24] of the world
[1:13:25] instead of our time to the Lord Jesus
[1:13:29] amen the Bible said that men shall not
[1:13:31] live by bread alone but by every word
[1:13:33] that proceeds from the mouth of God Amen
[1:13:37] he says see we're not Redeeming the time
[1:13:39] but we're giving it to this and giving
[1:13:41] it to this this is not the time to give
[1:13:44] all of your spare minutes to Amen to uh
[1:13:47] to entertainment or to the things of the
[1:13:49] world we ought to give every spare
