[43:43] [Music]
[44:00] So many times I've questioned
[44:04] certain circumstances
[44:07] or things I could not understand.
[44:14] Many times in trials,
[44:17] weakness blurs my vision and my
[44:21] frustration gets so out of hand.
[44:27] Oh, it's then I am reminded
[44:31] I've never been forsaken.
[44:34] I've never had to stand
[44:37] one test alone.
[44:40] And as I look at all the victories,
[44:44] the spirit rises up in me. And through
[44:48] the fire, my weakness is made strong.
[44:54] and go.
[44:58] He never promised that the cross will
[45:02] not get heavy and the hill will not be
[45:06] hard to find.
[45:12] He never offered
[45:14] our victories without fighting. But he
[45:17] said he would always come inside.
[45:23] Oh, just remember when you're standing
[45:27] in the valley of decision
[45:31] and the adversary says give
[45:36] just
[45:40] our God will show up. Yeah. And he will
[45:45] take you through the fire again.
[45:52] I know within myself that I will surely
[45:56] perish.
[45:58] But if I trust the hand of God, he will
[46:01] shield the flames again.
[46:06] again.
[46:10] He never promised that the cross will
[46:14] not get heavy and the hell will not be
[46:18] unto
[46:20] God.
[46:24] We never offer
[46:26] our victories with the mighty but
[46:30] will always come and saint.
[46:36] Just remember when you're standing in
[46:40] the valley of decision
[46:43] and the adversary said he
[46:48] just
[46:52] God will show up
[46:55] and he will take you through the fire.
[46:59] Sing he never promised. No, he never
[47:04] promised that the cross will not be
[47:07] heavy and the hell will not be hard to
[47:19] victory without fighting. But he said
[47:23] your help will come in.
[47:27] Church, just remember where you're
[47:30] standing.
[47:32] In the valley of decision and the
[47:36] adversary
[47:39] in just one
[47:44] our God has
[47:46] [Music]
[47:48] he will take you through the fire one
[47:52] more time. He never promised. No, he
[47:56] never promised that the cross will not
[47:59] get heavy and the hill will not be hard
[48:04] to
[48:07] say.
[48:09] He never offered
[48:12] our victories without fighting, but he
[48:15] said your help.
[48:20] [Music]
[48:24] Yeah.
[48:28] [Music]
[48:33] Just hold on.
[48:37] Our God will show up. Yeah. He will take
[48:42] you through the fire. Just hold on. Our
[48:50] God has showed up
[48:53] and he
[48:55] take you through the fire again.
[49:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[49:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.

[49:15] fire again. Amen.

[50:00] sweeter and sweeter and miracle are
[50:03] taking place. I won't say anything. I
[50:06] let the one that God is doing things to
[50:08] testify on their own. Amen. But God is
[50:11] working in a miraculous way. It
[50:14] refreshes our our soul, our our spirit.
[50:18] It just take you off this world and put
[50:20] you back again in a calm atmosphere at
[50:23] home where you feel like everything is
[50:26] calm and settled because God have heard
[50:29] your prayer. He have heard your heart.

[51:08] darkness there is a season for you.

[51:56] vacation they get sometime. So, I had to
[51:58] take the whole crew to go visit auntie
[52:01] who had a baby. So, they all fly. So

[52:12] bombarded right there. Sh. There we go.
[52:16] So that's what happened. So the Navy

[52:32] good time. Maybe one day if God's
[52:34] willing, we will do what we got to do.

[53:08] hear from heaven tonight. Amen.
[53:12] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Keep praying for the
[53:15] construction. Things are moving by
[53:18] faith.
[53:19] &gt;&gt; That's all I can explain you. If I sit
[53:21] down and try to explain you, you will
[53:23] not uh understand what I'm trying to
[53:26] say. Amen.
[53:27] Brother Robert, should I tell the the I
[53:32] don't see probably he went back over
[53:34] there. Amen.
[53:38] &gt;&gt; I don't know why I can't keep stuff away
[53:40] from you.
[53:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. Uh we we we put uh uh in the
[53:50] construction work of the fellowship
[53:52] hall, we added a shower over there.
[53:56] Amen.
[53:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:58] &gt;&gt; In case the sisters working working.
[54:01] &gt;&gt; So we we thought about you sisters. We
[54:03] thought about all the martas and things.
[54:06] So then we ordered the shower door here.
[54:10] Some of you been there. They saw the
[54:12] shower door over there. So when he came
[54:15] for some reason they took the shower.
[54:16] Brother Michael knows the story very
[54:18] well. They went and delivered that to a
[54:20] neighbor. I don't know if he was on the
[54:22] other side somewhere over there. So, we
[54:25] were looking for the shower door, can't
[54:26] find it, and it rained and the shower
[54:29] door was outside.
[54:31] So, it didn't affect the the door
[54:34] itself, but we call uh the company, we
[54:38] call Amazon, we say, "Hey, the shower
[54:40] door didn't show up here." And the photo
[54:42] they showing where they deliver it looks
[54:44] like in the bush or somewhere. They just
[54:46] drop it. And then, and here we waiting
[54:48] for the shower door over here. So,
[54:51] Brother Micah went all the way there to
[54:53] drag. I don't even know how he got it
[54:55] back here. So, by the time he got there,
[54:58] I already called. They say, "You know
[54:59] what? We're going to send a replacement
[55:01] and everything." So, they send a
[55:02] replacement door. And that's what we,
[55:05] Brother Michael, install over there. So,
[55:07] we got this door and put it back there
[55:09] and sat there. So, we've been calling
[55:11] them. We say, "Okay, now we find the
[55:13] first door. You come and pick it up."
[55:15] They don't come to pick up.
[55:20] Can I stop just here? So, we call the
[55:22] preacher. Amen. And we call again, come
[55:25] and pick it up. We schedule everything.
[55:28] Nobody showed up. Sister UK was here
[55:30] till what was it? 9. Nobody. 900 p.m.
[55:34] Nobody showed up. I call again, come and
[55:36] pick it up. Schedule an appointment.
[55:38] Nobody showed up. I called the third
[55:40] time. They look, they say, "You know
[55:42] what? It's over two month.
[55:49] This is over what is supposed to be done
[55:53] as a regulation. So we going to schedule
[55:56] one more time. If they don't show up,
[55:58] don't call us.
[56:03] &gt;&gt; Have I said something wrong?
[56:05] &gt;&gt; They say, "Hold on." They went and
[56:07] talked to the supervisor. They came
[56:08] back. They say, "If they don't show up
[56:11] on first attempt and second attempt, you
[56:14] take it. You stay with it. Uh, now guess
[56:18] what type of prayer changes now?
[56:23] &gt;&gt; Don't come to pick up.
[56:27] And guess what? Nobody showed up. A free
[56:30] door for the fellowship hall.
[56:32] &gt;&gt; It's sitting right there.
[56:34] [Applause]
[56:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. So you see what seems to be
[56:41] upsetting sometime,
[56:43] &gt;&gt; disappointed sometime, it's a blessing
[56:46] in disguisement. And because of the
[56:48] arrow, we got a free shower door
[56:51] &gt;&gt; in glass.
[56:55] &gt;&gt; God knows how to give you something
[56:57] without you paying a dam.
[57:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. You remember sister Lily's
[57:06] testimony? If she got everything wiped
[57:09] out
[57:10] &gt;&gt; without paying even a deductible,
[57:14] &gt;&gt; God is able.
[57:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. That anointing is not just on the
[57:19] building.
[57:22] &gt;&gt; I hope somebody's catching up tonight.
[57:24] It's not just on the building. It's also
[57:26] on human being.
[57:28] &gt;&gt; As a matter of fact, he started on human
[57:30] being. The church is really the people.
[57:33] We the one that brought God in this
[57:35] place. If God can do that for a
[57:37] building,
[57:39] &gt;&gt; how much more can God do for you?
[57:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. We don't deserve it. But by his
[57:47] grace, he's providing everything step by
[57:51] step. This is not the first time. This
[57:53] is a second testimony again. I don't
[57:56] know what is coming out. The way things
[57:57] are moving over there, if I sat there,
[57:59] if I sit down to explain you, you won't
[58:01] even believe how we're moving. It is
[58:03] just God for even the constructor to
[58:06] work with us the way they are working in
[58:08] nothing but God. Amen. So keep praying,
[58:12] keep believing. God is working. Amen.
[58:16] Let's go with only believe.

[1:08:18] [Applause]
[1:08:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah.

[1:08:28] &gt;&gt; You know the song leader wrote the song
[1:08:30] say victory is mine.
[1:08:34] &gt;&gt; And then he went on to say joy is mine.
[1:08:37] &gt;&gt; So that mean if it's mine I don't have
[1:08:39] to give it up.
[1:08:42] It belongs to me.
[1:08:44] &gt;&gt; So when I'm in the valley in my dark
[1:08:45] spot, I don't have to give that up.
[1:08:48] &gt;&gt; I don't matter, it don't matter how bad
[1:08:49] it get, I don't have to give that up
[1:08:51] &gt;&gt; because it belongs to me.
[1:08:54] &gt;&gt; It belongs to me.
[1:08:57] &gt;&gt; If you got your Bibles, let's turn to
[1:08:59] the book of Psalms.
[1:09:02] &gt;&gt; As we go to the word,
[1:09:05] [Music]
[1:09:07] let's
[1:09:07] &gt;&gt; go to the book of Psalms.
[1:09:12] Chapter 82
[1:09:15] verse 1.
[1:09:20] &gt;&gt; If you got it, say amen.
[1:09:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:24] &gt;&gt; Psalms 82:1 says, "God
[1:09:28] &gt;&gt; standeth in the congregation of the
[1:09:31] mighty
[1:09:33] &gt;&gt; and he judgeth among the gods." I said
[1:09:37] it.
[1:09:38] &gt;&gt; And we we going to move on to verse six.
[1:09:43] &gt;&gt; And it says, I have said
[1:09:45] &gt;&gt; ye are gods.
[1:09:47] &gt;&gt; And all of you are children of the most
[1:09:49] high.
[1:09:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:51] &gt;&gt; Verse seven says, "But ye shall die like
[1:09:53] men
[1:09:54] &gt;&gt; and fall like one of the princes."
[1:09:57] &gt;&gt; Let's bless the reading of the word.
[1:09:59] Lord God, we ask that you bless your
[1:10:00] word, oh father. Oh Lord God, we that
[1:10:02] you anoint every scripture. Oh father.
[1:10:04] Oh God, we commit this service back in
[1:10:06] your hands. Oh father, I guess you would
[1:10:08] touch every heart, oh Lord God, that
[1:10:10] they will receive your word, oh father.
[1:10:12] Oh God, you say that those that are
[1:10:14] thirst or hunger for righteousness, oh
[1:10:16] father, they shall be filled, oh father.
[1:10:18] Oh God, and we are bringing that
[1:10:19] petition tonight, oh father, that you
[1:10:21] will fill our hearts with glad tidings,
[1:10:23] oh father, tonight. Oh God, we ask that
[1:10:25] you would bless this service in the name
[1:10:26] of Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen.
[1:10:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:30] &gt;&gt; You may be seated.
[1:10:36] Verse one say God standeth in the
[1:10:38] congregation of the mighty.
[1:10:40] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:10:41] &gt;&gt; And he judgeth among the gods.
[1:10:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:45] &gt;&gt; And verse six says, I have said ye are
[1:10:49] gods.
[1:10:51] &gt;&gt; And all of you are children of the most
[1:10:53] high.
[1:10:56] &gt;&gt; Now verse seven to me
[1:11:00] seems like a reminder.
[1:11:02] Amen.
[1:11:03] &gt;&gt; If if you see what I'm saying,
[1:11:05] &gt;&gt; he he's saying but
[1:11:08] &gt;&gt; even though I said I have said ye are
[1:11:10] gods
[1:11:12] &gt;&gt; and you are children of the most high
[1:11:15] &gt;&gt; but you shall die like men and fall like
[1:11:19] one of the princes. So that mean he
[1:11:20] telling to you that you got a corner
[1:11:22] side
[1:11:23] &gt;&gt; that you can't get away from that corner
[1:11:25] side.
[1:11:26] &gt;&gt; Even though I call you a god but you are
[1:11:28] subject to that corner side. And we want
[1:11:31] we want to talk about that tonight.
[1:11:34] &gt;&gt; Um th those two minds, that spiritual
[1:11:37] mind and that carnal mind.
[1:11:42] &gt;&gt; And the name the name of this subject
[1:11:44] tonight, my subject tonight is come up
[1:11:46] higher.
[1:11:48] &gt;&gt; God has already made a way.
[1:11:52] &gt;&gt; Come up higher.
[1:11:54] &gt;&gt; God has already made a way.
[1:11:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:00] Amen.
[1:12:02] &gt;&gt; And as we can see, I'm going to try to
[1:12:04] use this board tonight.
[1:12:07] &gt;&gt; It fits the purpose.
[1:12:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes, sir.
[1:12:17] &gt;&gt; I'm just I'm going just put verse six.
[1:12:20] We know what it means. This this is the
[1:12:23] Psalms verse 6. This is the spiritual.
[1:12:28] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:12:33] So you know what we dealing with. Then
[1:12:35] verse seven, this this is your physical.
[1:12:40] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:12:43] &gt;&gt; Or I like to call it corner.
[1:12:50] And and what I want to draw from this is
[1:12:56] even though we're Christians tonight and
[1:12:58] we are God's
[1:13:00] &gt;&gt; sometimes we'll find ourselves falling
[1:13:03] in that realm right there
[1:13:05] &gt;&gt; and that corner mind realm
[1:13:07] &gt;&gt; and sometimes we get stuck there
[1:13:10] &gt;&gt; and then we're we're praying and crying
[1:13:12] out to God and we're trying to get a
[1:13:14] hold of God but really we have fallen
[1:13:16] from our position.
[1:13:18] We are sons and daughters of God.
[1:13:20] &gt;&gt; We don't have no business operating down
[1:13:22] here.
[1:13:24] &gt;&gt; Even though we're subject to that,
[1:13:26] &gt;&gt; but to communicate with God, we got to
[1:13:28] come up higher.
[1:13:30] &gt;&gt; We can't stay right here. We got to come
[1:13:32] up higher into in the spiritual realm.
[1:13:36] &gt;&gt; Because in in this mind, in this mind
[1:13:39] right here in verse 7, it's the physical
[1:13:40] corner mind.
[1:13:42] &gt;&gt; This mind tells you that God has to make
[1:13:46] a way.
[1:13:47] If you if you see what I'm saying,
[1:13:50] &gt;&gt; this mind convinces you that you have to
[1:13:52] wait to that God got to figure out
[1:13:56] &gt;&gt; how to find an answer to your problem,
[1:13:58] &gt;&gt; that he got to figure out how to find an
[1:14:01] answer to your solution.
[1:14:02] &gt;&gt; And then but and we can come up a little
[1:14:04] higher
[1:14:05] &gt;&gt; and we can operate in this mind right
[1:14:07] here and we can find out that God has
[1:14:10] already made a way
[1:14:13] &gt;&gt; and that that's and that's where we want
[1:14:15] to be at tonight.
[1:14:17] Amen.
[1:14:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:19] &gt;&gt; Yes, my brother.
[1:14:21] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:14:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:24] &gt;&gt; And I think about it sometimes and and
[1:14:26] sometimes we fall down in that realm.
[1:14:29] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:14:30] &gt;&gt; And then we we we God will send trouble.
[1:14:34] &gt;&gt; He He'll send darkness. He'll send all
[1:14:36] kind of things your way. Why? Because it
[1:14:38] drives you to pray.
[1:14:41] &gt;&gt; He sends you to your knees so you can
[1:14:42] pray. So in that praying
[1:14:45] &gt;&gt; that you can get that connection back
[1:14:47] &gt;&gt; and through prayer you can be you can go
[1:14:50] back higher
[1:14:51] &gt;&gt; and you can get back in your position
[1:14:53] that you was at because you want to get
[1:14:55] back in the congregation of the mighty.
[1:14:58] &gt;&gt; You want to stay in the congregation of
[1:14:59] the mighty. That's where your power and
[1:15:01] your strength come from in the
[1:15:03] congregation of the mighty.
[1:15:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:08] glory to God.
[1:15:09] &gt;&gt; And that's where the devil sits in that
[1:15:11] realm and he creates all kind of
[1:15:13] strongholds. That's why the Bible say
[1:15:14] you got to cast those thoughts down
[1:15:17] because they standing in the way between
[1:15:18] you going higher. So you got to reach up
[1:15:21] and cast those things down so you can
[1:15:23] get back to your position.
[1:15:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:30] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:15:32] &gt;&gt; Let's go to the book of Genesis.
[1:15:35] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:15:44] You know what? Whole Genesis, we Let's
[1:15:46] go to First Kings chapter 18. Holy Ghost
[1:15:49] is sharp.
[1:15:55] &gt;&gt; Let's go to First Kings.
[1:15:59] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:16:02] Help me.
[1:16:06] Go to First Kings chapter 18.
[1:16:08] &gt;&gt; Yes, my brother
[1:16:10] &gt;&gt; verse 36.
[1:16:13] &gt;&gt; I'm going show you how easy it is to be
[1:16:16] in that realm and then slip down in that
[1:16:20] corner realm, but it don't change your
[1:16:22] position.
[1:16:24] &gt;&gt; It don't change who you are.
[1:16:27] &gt;&gt; And this is the story of Elijah. That's
[1:16:29] right.
[1:16:32] &gt;&gt; If you got First Kings chapter 18, say,
[1:16:34] "Amen."
[1:16:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:39] &gt;&gt; Okay. Let's see.
[1:16:43] &gt;&gt; Okay. Wait a minute. First Kings.
[1:16:46] Okay, there we go.
[1:16:51] Second Kings.
[1:17:00] But we got to we got to stay in the
[1:17:01] spiritual realm tonight.
[1:17:04] &gt;&gt; Cuz that's where we are called to be at.
[1:17:07] &gt;&gt; And it says, "And it came to pass at the
[1:17:10] time of the offering
[1:17:11] &gt;&gt; of the evening sacrifice."
[1:17:13] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:17:14] &gt;&gt; That Elijah the prophet came near and
[1:17:17] said, Lord God of Abraham,
[1:17:19] &gt;&gt; Isaac, and Israel,
[1:17:21] &gt;&gt; let it be known this day,
[1:17:23] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. that thou are God in Israel.
[1:17:26] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[1:17:27] &gt;&gt; And that I am thy servant and that I
[1:17:29] have done all these things at thy word.
[1:17:33] &gt;&gt; And it goes on and say, "Hear me, oh
[1:17:35] Lord. Hear me that this people may know
[1:17:39] that thou art the Lord God
[1:17:41] &gt;&gt; and that thou has turned their heart
[1:17:43] back again."
[1:17:45] Then the fire of the Lord fell and
[1:17:47] consumed the burnt sacrifice and the
[1:17:50] wood and the stones and the dust and it
[1:17:53] licked up the water that was in the
[1:17:54] trench. And verse 39 says, "And when all
[1:17:58] the people saw it, they fell on their
[1:18:00] faces and they said, "The Lord, he is
[1:18:03] the God."
[1:18:04] &gt;&gt; He is the God.
[1:18:06] &gt;&gt; The Lord, he is the God.
[1:18:08] &gt;&gt; God. That's right.
[1:18:10] &gt;&gt; Verse 40 says, "And Elijah said unto
[1:18:12] them, take the prophets of Baal
[1:18:16] and let not one of them escape."
[1:18:19] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:18:19] &gt;&gt; And they took them, and Elijah brought
[1:18:21] them down to the brook, Keshan, and slew
[1:18:24] them there.
[1:18:25] &gt;&gt; Right
[1:18:26] &gt;&gt; now, I want you to move I want you to I
[1:18:28] want you to move over to ver chapter 19,
[1:18:32] &gt;&gt; verse one.
[1:18:34] &gt;&gt; Move over.
[1:18:39] Now he he just called fire down. Just
[1:18:41] just just threw all the prophets. So So
[1:18:44] we know that them things can't be done
[1:18:45] in the physical realm.
[1:18:47] &gt;&gt; So he was operating in the spiritual
[1:18:49] realm.
[1:18:50] &gt;&gt; But wa watch how fast he slide down.
[1:18:53] &gt;&gt; Watch how easy it take for him to slide
[1:18:55] down. In chapter 9 verse one
[1:18:58] &gt;&gt; it says and Ahab told Jezebel
[1:19:02] &gt;&gt; all that Elijah had done
[1:19:04] &gt;&gt; and with the how he had slain all the
[1:19:07] prophets with the sword.
[1:19:10] Verse two says, "Then Jezebel sent a
[1:19:13] messenger unto Elijah, saying, so let
[1:19:16] the gods do to me and more also if I
[1:19:20] make not thy life as the life of one of
[1:19:23] them by tomorrow about this time."
[1:19:27] &gt;&gt; Then she go a woman. This he go ahead
[1:19:29] and say in verse three, and when he saw
[1:19:31] that, he arose and went for his life
[1:19:35] &gt;&gt; and came to Beeba with belonging to
[1:19:38] Judith and left his servant there.
[1:19:41] &gt;&gt; Now, we're talking about a man of God
[1:19:42] who just left the presence of God.
[1:19:44] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:19:45] &gt;&gt; He got he got a he got a word from
[1:19:48] Jezebel that saying she was going to
[1:19:50] take his life.
[1:19:50] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:19:52] &gt;&gt; Now, he find himself on the run.
[1:19:56] Go to verse skip over to verse 17.
[1:20:02] &gt;&gt; Verse 17 said, "And it shall come to
[1:20:05] pass that him that escapeth the sword of
[1:20:08] Hazel shall Jahu slay. And him that
[1:20:11] escapeth the sword of Jahu shall Elisha
[1:20:14] slay." God was telling Elijah,
[1:20:17] I have already made a way
[1:20:21] &gt;&gt; to take care of Jezebel.
[1:20:24] You don't see Jezebel name in the
[1:20:25] scripture, but that scripture covered
[1:20:28] her. God was letting him know that he
[1:20:30] was already he she already taken care
[1:20:32] of. So take your mind off of her and
[1:20:34] what she's doing. You stay focused on
[1:20:37] what I told you to do. You stay focused
[1:20:40] on where I sent you. Don't worry about
[1:20:43] Jezebel. I don't made no way to take
[1:20:45] care of her.
[1:20:52] Amen.
[1:20:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:54] &gt;&gt; In the message, God provided way for
[1:20:56] this day,
[1:20:57] &gt;&gt; 1964,
[1:21:00] &gt;&gt; paragraph 8, it said, God always has had
[1:21:04] a way.
[1:21:04] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. Always.
[1:21:06] &gt;&gt; There is two ways.
[1:21:08] &gt;&gt; That's our ways or his ways.
[1:21:11] &gt;&gt; God has a way for today.
[1:21:13] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. For he's always made a way for
[1:21:15] everything.
[1:21:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:17] &gt;&gt; God at the beginning know the end.
[1:21:20] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:21:20] &gt;&gt; So he has laid out his scripture
[1:21:22] &gt;&gt; for each age.
[1:21:24] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:21:24] &gt;&gt; And that age when it comes along Yes
[1:21:26] sir.
[1:21:27] &gt;&gt; Now don't fail to see this.
[1:21:29] &gt;&gt; He says that age when it comes along,
[1:21:32] &gt;&gt; usually the ministry is so mixed up
[1:21:35] &gt;&gt; in isms and so forth
[1:21:37] &gt;&gt; and traditions till it's a million miles
[1:21:40] away from the word.
[1:21:41] &gt;&gt; That's right. And he says, "And then God
[1:21:43] always sends someone on the scene,
[1:21:46] &gt;&gt; a prophet."
[1:21:47] &gt;&gt; And this prophet, God never changes his
[1:21:50] system.
[1:21:51] &gt;&gt; He never changes his ways.
[1:21:53] &gt;&gt; He always does it the same way.
[1:21:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:56] &gt;&gt; He always has.
[1:21:58] &gt;&gt; He must do it in this time.
[1:22:00] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:22:01] &gt;&gt; And through this, God works and
[1:22:02] vindicates that word.
[1:22:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:04] &gt;&gt; As I spoke to you last night, he says,
[1:22:07] God doing his own interpretation.
[1:22:09] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. God needs no one to interpret
[1:22:12] the word to him.
[1:22:14] &gt;&gt; He interprets it himself. That's right.
[1:22:16] &gt;&gt; By vindicating it,
[1:22:17] &gt;&gt; making it real.
[1:22:19] &gt;&gt; And when God said he that he'll do a
[1:22:21] certain thing, then he does it.
[1:22:24] &gt;&gt; There is no more question to it.
[1:22:26] &gt;&gt; That's the way he does it.
[1:22:28] &gt;&gt; So God has made a way for us.
[1:22:31] &gt;&gt; God loves his children.
[1:22:33] &gt;&gt; He loves his people.
[1:22:34] &gt;&gt; He wants to help them.
[1:22:37] &gt;&gt; He wants to help you more than you want
[1:22:39] help.
[1:22:40] If you can just get that in your heart
[1:22:43] &gt;&gt; that God is more willing to help you
[1:22:46] than you are to help yourself.
[1:22:48] &gt;&gt; But he has a way
[1:22:50] &gt;&gt; and that's the only way that he'll work
[1:22:53] is through his way.
[1:22:55] &gt;&gt; You must come to his terms,
[1:22:57] &gt;&gt; not your terms.
[1:22:59] &gt;&gt; His terms.
[1:23:00] &gt;&gt; You want it a certain way, but he gives
[1:23:02] it to you his way.
[1:23:05] [Applause]
[1:23:07] &gt;&gt; God's provided way tonight. Yes, sir.
[1:23:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:12] &gt;&gt; Let's let's flip to the book of Genesis,
[1:23:15] &gt;&gt; chapter one.
[1:23:16] &gt;&gt; Yes, my brother.
[1:23:17] &gt;&gt; Chapter one, verse 26.
[1:23:19] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:23:20] &gt;&gt; Yes, my brother.
[1:23:23] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:23:24] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:23:25] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:23:26] &gt;&gt; Why you Why you finding that? You know,
[1:23:28] the prodical son found himself in the
[1:23:30] same situation.
[1:23:32] &gt;&gt; You know, he he had the mind that he had
[1:23:34] when he was home before he left. He was
[1:23:37] already in the spiritual realm.
[1:23:39] &gt;&gt; He was with the father.
[1:23:42] &gt;&gt; He was with the father.
[1:23:44] &gt;&gt; But he left the father to go in the
[1:23:46] world.
[1:23:47] &gt;&gt; So he slid down to that physical cornal
[1:23:50] mind. But the bible said when he came
[1:23:52] back to himself
[1:23:55] when he came back to himself
[1:23:58] &gt;&gt; but the only mistake he made he didn't
[1:24:00] come up higher enough.
[1:24:02] &gt;&gt; He came up a little higher. He asked his
[1:24:05] father, "Can he come back as a servant?"
[1:24:08] But that's not high enough.
[1:24:10] That's not high enough. He asked his
[1:24:13] father, "Can I be a servant?" And his
[1:24:16] father said, "That's not high enough."
[1:24:18] Sometime the eagle go down in the valley
[1:24:20] and she'll flap her wings and then she
[1:24:23] will come up higher. But sometime we
[1:24:25] don't jump high enough. But the father
[1:24:28] quickly corrected that thing. He say,
[1:24:30] "No, you are my son. I'm going to put
[1:24:32] you back in the position. I'm going to
[1:24:34] put you back where you belong.
[1:24:40] &gt;&gt; Don't short change yourself tonight.
[1:24:42] Don't short change yourself tonight. You
[1:24:45] belong in the congregation of the
[1:24:46] mighty. Don't short change yourself
[1:24:49] tonight. Just because you got a sickness
[1:24:52] and you can see symptoms, don't short
[1:24:54] change yourself tonight. I tell you to
[1:24:57] come a little bit higher. Come a little
[1:24:59] bit higher.
[1:25:01] You might be taking medication tonight,
[1:25:03] but I tell you to come a little bit
[1:25:05] higher because in that realm, you don't
[1:25:07] need no medication.
[1:25:09] Come a little bit higher. You are healed
[1:25:12] by his stripes tonight.
[1:25:15] That's what this mind tell you. I am
[1:25:18] healed by his stripes. Come a little bit
[1:25:20] higher tonight.
[1:25:22] Why? Because God has already made a way.
[1:25:27] &gt;&gt; He's not making a way. He's already made
[1:25:29] a way.
[1:25:32] &gt;&gt; And that's what we want to deal with
[1:25:33] tonight because that's what Christians
[1:25:34] struggle with.
[1:25:36] &gt;&gt; We struggle with that.
[1:25:38] &gt;&gt; We we feel like when we approach God, we
[1:25:41] don't approach him the right way.
[1:25:43] &gt;&gt; We we approach God like he got to go in
[1:25:46] the laboratory
[1:25:47] &gt;&gt; and create a custom
[1:25:50] &gt;&gt; situation to defeat your situation.
[1:25:52] &gt;&gt; But I ask you tonight, what more can he
[1:25:54] do?
[1:25:55] &gt;&gt; What more can he do?
[1:25:56] &gt;&gt; What more can he do?
[1:25:59] He's already made a way.
[1:26:01] &gt;&gt; So that's the way we got to approach him
[1:26:03] tonight. Knowing that whatever we need,
[1:26:06] &gt;&gt; that whatever we ask for that he has
[1:26:09] already made a way for it.
[1:26:11] &gt;&gt; All we got to do is wait for that
[1:26:12] appointed time.
[1:26:18] &gt;&gt; I think I was talking to a brother a
[1:26:20] week ago and um I said, "You know what?
[1:26:22] It's it's funny how we can go to the
[1:26:24] doctors and we can trust the doctor.
[1:26:29] &gt;&gt; We we we go on there with our symptoms
[1:26:33] &gt;&gt; and we already know
[1:26:35] &gt;&gt; we we know
[1:26:37] &gt;&gt; that the doctor has a list of
[1:26:39] medications
[1:26:41] &gt;&gt; that he going to go through to prescribe
[1:26:43] you.
[1:26:44] &gt;&gt; So what I'm trying to tell you, he ain't
[1:26:46] going to invent nothing new.
[1:26:49] &gt;&gt; He ain't going to go make no new
[1:26:51] medicine for you.
[1:26:52] &gt;&gt; What I'm what I want you to see, he
[1:26:54] going to give you what he already have.
[1:26:58] He going to give you what he already
[1:27:00] have.
[1:27:01] &gt;&gt; But yeah, we walk in there and we take
[1:27:04] them at their word. But not one time do
[1:27:07] we ask the doctor, "Lord, I see what you
[1:27:09] got, doc. I see the list of medications
[1:27:11] you got, but can you go make me some new
[1:27:13] medicine?" We don't do that. We take
[1:27:16] whatever he give us.
[1:27:18] &gt;&gt; And that's the way we got to approach
[1:27:19] God. We got to portion like whatever we
[1:27:22] need, he already has it. There's nothing
[1:27:25] special he has to do.
[1:27:28] [Music]
[1:27:33] &gt;&gt; Genesis 1, let's go to verse chapter 1
[1:27:35] verse 26.
[1:27:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:39] &gt;&gt; And the prophet constantly talks about
[1:27:41] how everything started in Genesis
[1:27:44] &gt;&gt; was the beginning of all things.
[1:27:46] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:27:48] &gt;&gt; And what I want you to do is u go to
[1:27:50] verse 26. And it says,
[1:27:52] &gt;&gt; it says, "And God said,
[1:27:54] &gt;&gt; uhhuh,
[1:27:55] &gt;&gt; let us
[1:27:57] &gt;&gt; make man in our image."
[1:27:59] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:28:00] &gt;&gt; After our likeness,
[1:28:02] &gt;&gt; "And let them have dominion over the
[1:28:05] fish of the sea."
[1:28:06] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:28:06] &gt;&gt; And over the fowl of the air,
[1:28:08] &gt;&gt; and over the cattle,
[1:28:10] &gt;&gt; and over all the earth,
[1:28:12] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:28:12] &gt;&gt; and over every creeping thing that
[1:28:15] creepeth
[1:28:16] upon the earth.
[1:28:18] &gt;&gt; That's right. So what I what I what I
[1:28:20] want you to see is that man he created
[1:28:23] man in his image.
[1:28:25] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:28:26] &gt;&gt; And and the the definition for creating
[1:28:30] means bringing something new into
[1:28:33] existence from nothing.
[1:28:36] &gt;&gt; Taking a thought
[1:28:38] &gt;&gt; and bringing it into existence.
[1:28:43] &gt;&gt; And let's move on to chapter two verse
[1:28:46] 7.
[1:28:47] &gt;&gt; Yes sir. Verse
[1:28:49] seven says, "And the Lord God formed
[1:28:52] right
[1:28:52] &gt;&gt; manhuh
[1:28:54] &gt;&gt; of the dust of the ground, right,
[1:28:56] &gt;&gt; and breathed into his nostrils the
[1:28:57] breath of life,
[1:28:59] &gt;&gt; and man became a living soul."
[1:29:00] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:29:02] &gt;&gt; If you if you will back up, back up into
[1:29:06] verse uh five. I want to make it live a
[1:29:11] little bit.
[1:29:12] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:29:12] &gt;&gt; Back up to verse five.
[1:29:13] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:29:14] &gt;&gt; Chapter 2, verse 5.
[1:29:15] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. Verse five says, "And every plant
[1:29:17] of the field before it was in the earth,
[1:29:20] and every herb of the field before it
[1:29:22] grew, for the Lord God had not caused it
[1:29:25] to rain upon the earth."
[1:29:27] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:29:27] &gt;&gt; And there was not a man
[1:29:30] &gt;&gt; to teal the ground.
[1:29:32] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:29:33] &gt;&gt; Now, this looked like a potential
[1:29:36] problem.
[1:29:36] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.
[1:29:37] &gt;&gt; God created everything. Everything was
[1:29:39] good. But when they got to this garden
[1:29:42] and he said there was no man. Now this
[1:29:44] looked like a potential problem.
[1:29:47] &gt;&gt; But verse seven said, "The Lord God
[1:29:49] formed man of the dust of the ground."
[1:29:52] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:29:53] &gt;&gt; And breathed into his nostrils the
[1:29:55] breath of life,
[1:29:56] &gt;&gt; and man became a living soul.
[1:29:58] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:29:59] &gt;&gt; So, what I want you to draw from this is
[1:30:01] that potential problem that it looked
[1:30:03] alike,
[1:30:04] &gt;&gt; that he didn't have a manh
[1:30:06] &gt;&gt; to till the groundh,
[1:30:08] &gt;&gt; he had already made a way for that.
[1:30:09] That's it. That's it. That's it. That's
[1:30:13] it.
[1:30:14] &gt;&gt; Even though you couldn't see that man,
[1:30:18] &gt;&gt; even though you couldn't see that man,
[1:30:21] &gt;&gt; he was already there.
[1:30:23] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:30:24] &gt;&gt; God had already made a way.
[1:30:27] &gt;&gt; Apply that to your life tonight.
[1:30:29] &gt;&gt; Just be just because you can't see the
[1:30:32] solution to your problem.
[1:30:35] Just because you can't see the answer to
[1:30:37] your problem tonight don't mean it's not
[1:30:40] there. God had already made a way for
[1:30:43] what you need tonight.
[1:30:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen.
[1:30:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. Glory to God.
[1:30:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:30:56] &gt;&gt; It's already done.
[1:30:57] &gt;&gt; Already done.
[1:30:59] &gt;&gt; God had created everything
[1:31:01] &gt;&gt; that he needed,
[1:31:02] &gt;&gt; right? And then he formed it
[1:31:05] &gt;&gt; right
[1:31:06] &gt;&gt; when he needed it.
[1:31:08] &gt;&gt; Did that make sense? Yes, sir.
[1:31:10] &gt;&gt; So what I'm saying, the answer to your
[1:31:12] problem already exist.
[1:31:15] &gt;&gt; It already exists.
[1:31:16] &gt;&gt; He already has it. So he saves it into
[1:31:19] that appointed time.
[1:31:21] &gt;&gt; He saves it to that appointed time and
[1:31:24] then he he forms it and he releases it
[1:31:26] to you.
[1:31:27] &gt;&gt; So our job is to just wait on the Lord.
[1:31:30] &gt;&gt; Wait on the Lord. We we're not battling
[1:31:33] where it coming from or it or do it
[1:31:35] exist. We already know he made a way. So
[1:31:38] just wait on it.
[1:31:39] &gt;&gt; Just wait on it.
[1:31:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:44] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:31:45] &gt;&gt; In the book of Isaiah 55:8 it says, "For
[1:31:49] my thoughts are not your thoughts."
[1:31:51] &gt;&gt; Neither are your ways my ways, says the
[1:31:53] Lord.
[1:31:54] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:31:54] &gt;&gt; Verse 9 say, "For as the heavens are
[1:31:56] higher than the earth,
[1:31:58] &gt;&gt; so are my ways higher than yours."
[1:32:00] &gt;&gt; That's right. and my thoughts than
[1:32:02] yours.
[1:32:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:04] &gt;&gt; Turn to the book of Psalms, chapter 23.
[1:32:08] Turn to Psalms 23.
[1:32:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:13] &gt;&gt; So we can rest or not knowing that he
[1:32:15] already made a way.
[1:32:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:21] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:32:22] &gt;&gt; Verse one says, "The Lord is my
[1:32:24] shepherd.
[1:32:26] &gt;&gt; I shall not want."
[1:32:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:28] Hallelujah.
[1:32:28] &gt;&gt; He maketh me to lie down in green
[1:32:31] pastures.
[1:32:31] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:32:33] &gt;&gt; He leadeth me beside the still waters.
[1:32:37] &gt;&gt; Now I want you to look at that.
[1:32:39] &gt;&gt; He said he leadth me.
[1:32:42] &gt;&gt; So if anybody is leading you
[1:32:46] &gt;&gt; that mean wherever you going
[1:32:49] &gt;&gt; they going to get there first.
[1:32:53] &gt;&gt; I want you to see that tonight.
[1:32:55] &gt;&gt; If he is leading you
[1:32:57] Wherever he's taking you,
[1:32:59] &gt;&gt; that means he's going to get there
[1:33:01] first.
[1:33:03] &gt;&gt; So, so if he leads you to a test,
[1:33:06] &gt;&gt; if he leads you to a problem, just rest
[1:33:09] assure and know that he already got
[1:33:11] there
[1:33:12] &gt;&gt; because he's in the front
[1:33:15] &gt;&gt; and then he comes back and he walks in
[1:33:17] you,
[1:33:18] &gt;&gt; then he be a defender behind you.
[1:33:21] &gt;&gt; He already got to your problem.
[1:33:23] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:33:24] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. So why do we worry?
[1:33:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:33:28] &gt;&gt; So why do we worry?
[1:33:30] &gt;&gt; Why do we worry about our circumstances
[1:33:32] and our situations? God say he lead us
[1:33:34] to those things.
[1:33:36] &gt;&gt; He's getting there first.
[1:33:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:33:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:43] &gt;&gt; He's getting there first.
[1:33:45] &gt;&gt; Now I can understand the testimony now.
[1:33:47] It don't matter where I go. As long as
[1:33:48] you with me,
[1:33:50] long as you doing the leading, Lord, I
[1:33:52] know you already got there. And then and
[1:33:54] with you getting there before me, I know
[1:33:55] you already made a way.
[1:33:58] &gt;&gt; Because just his presence makes a way.
[1:34:01] &gt;&gt; Just his presence makes a way.
[1:34:05] &gt;&gt; Now let's look at Joel. Let's let's look
[1:34:07] at the process and and it's it's amazing
[1:34:09] how you can read the same scriptures,
[1:34:12] the same stories over and over and you
[1:34:14] can see different things
[1:34:16] &gt;&gt; and God God will show you different
[1:34:18] stuff.
[1:34:20] &gt;&gt; Turn to the book of Job verse one.
[1:34:22] &gt;&gt; Yes. I'm in chapter one verse, we're
[1:34:24] going to start at verse six.
[1:34:29] And see, the enemy don't want you to see
[1:34:31] how these things work.
[1:34:34] &gt;&gt; Verse six says, you got to say, amen.
[1:34:37] &gt;&gt; Verse six says, "Now there was a day
[1:34:39] when the sons of God came to present
[1:34:42] themselves before the Lord."
[1:34:44] &gt;&gt; And Satan came also among them, and the
[1:34:48] Lord said unto Satan, "Whence comest
[1:34:50] thou?"
[1:34:51] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.
[1:34:52] Then Satan answered the Lord and said,
[1:34:55] "From going to and fro
[1:34:58] &gt;&gt; in the earth, and from walking up and
[1:35:00] down in it."
[1:35:03] Verse eight says, "And the Lord said
[1:35:04] unto Satan, has thou considered my
[1:35:08] servant Job,
[1:35:10] &gt;&gt; that there is none like him in the
[1:35:12] earth, a perfect and upright man, one
[1:35:17] that fearth God
[1:35:19] &gt;&gt; and escapeth evil." Right?
[1:35:21] &gt;&gt; Then Satan answered the Lord and said,
[1:35:24] "Doeth Job fear God for not."
[1:35:27] &gt;&gt; So basically what he's saying,
[1:35:30] he only serving you because of the
[1:35:31] things he got.
[1:35:33] &gt;&gt; The only the only reason he praising you
[1:35:35] because of his riches.
[1:35:37] &gt;&gt; That's basically what he was saying. So
[1:35:39] that's why his request was he said, "If
[1:35:40] I can take those things away from him,
[1:35:43] &gt;&gt; then I can get him to curse you."
[1:35:45] &gt;&gt; So that that's basically what he was
[1:35:47] saying,
[1:35:47] &gt;&gt; right? So what what I want want to draw
[1:35:49] from this is that
[1:35:51] Joel wouldn't dare to discuss this.
[1:35:55] &gt;&gt; It was God and Satan.
[1:35:57] &gt;&gt; So we talking about a test
[1:35:59] &gt;&gt; that God is negotiating
[1:36:02] &gt;&gt; with the devil.
[1:36:04] &gt;&gt; And Job ain't got no say so.
[1:36:07] &gt;&gt; Job ain't got nothing to do with it.
[1:36:09] &gt;&gt; But God is negotiating this test.
[1:36:12] &gt;&gt; That's right. So, so what I want you to
[1:36:14] see is that it don't matter when this
[1:36:17] test make it to Job.
[1:36:20] God had it first.
[1:36:22] &gt;&gt; God had it first. God negotiated the
[1:36:25] terms. He sought the conditions. He
[1:36:29] sought the governor. He sought the
[1:36:30] limits.
[1:36:33] [Music]
[1:36:33] [Applause]
[1:36:35] &gt;&gt; And and then and then God God began to
[1:36:38] call out what he couldn't do. He said,
[1:36:40] "You can do this, but you can't do that.
[1:36:42] You can do this, but you can't do that.
[1:36:44] It's kind of like when you go to the
[1:36:46] airport, your bag got to go through
[1:36:47] customs.
[1:36:48] &gt;&gt; So, what Satan wanted to do, he had to
[1:36:50] go through customs. God had to God had
[1:36:52] to go over it. And he looked at it. He
[1:36:54] and he he he looked at it. He said,
[1:36:56] "Well, all of us are made different."
[1:36:59] &gt;&gt; Throw that in. Everybody can't handle
[1:37:01] the same thing.
[1:37:03] &gt;&gt; So, so Satan desires to take your life.
[1:37:06] He desires to finish the job. But God
[1:37:08] goes in
[1:37:09] &gt;&gt; and he and he looks at it. Okay, you
[1:37:11] want this son right here. You want my
[1:37:13] son right here?
[1:37:14] &gt;&gt; Well, let me let me look and see what
[1:37:16] are the limitations of this son.
[1:37:19] &gt;&gt; Let me see what the limitations of this
[1:37:20] son.
[1:37:21] &gt;&gt; And he looks in there and if Satan got a
[1:37:24] request,
[1:37:25] &gt;&gt; if he requesting to do something
[1:37:28] &gt;&gt; that you can't handle, God takes it out.
[1:37:31] &gt;&gt; He plucks it out.
[1:37:33] &gt;&gt; He takes it out in the contract.
[1:37:35] &gt;&gt; He move it. He say you can do this, but
[1:37:36] you can't take his life.
[1:37:39] &gt;&gt; Why? Because I got more work for him to
[1:37:40] do. So you can't do that. It's a reason.
[1:37:43] And he he do each and every one of us
[1:37:46] like that.
[1:37:46] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:37:47] &gt;&gt; He analyzes our situation, our
[1:37:49] condition. He know how much you can
[1:37:51] handle. That's the reason he said, "I
[1:37:53] won't put no more on you than you can
[1:37:55] bear."
[1:37:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:01] &gt;&gt; He said, he answered the Lord and said,
[1:38:03] "Do Joe fear God for not?
[1:38:06] &gt;&gt; Has not thou made a hedge about him
[1:38:08] &gt;&gt; and about his house? and about all that
[1:38:11] he have on every side.
[1:38:14] &gt;&gt; So, he was letting God know that I
[1:38:16] wasn't just checking checking Job out,
[1:38:18] &gt;&gt; sir.
[1:38:18] &gt;&gt; But I was checking everything out.
[1:38:20] &gt;&gt; I was watching his house.
[1:38:22] &gt;&gt; I was watching his children. Yes, sir.
[1:38:24] &gt;&gt; I was watching his wife.
[1:38:26] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:38:26] &gt;&gt; I was watching everything that was
[1:38:28] connected to him.
[1:38:30] &gt;&gt; And and God say, "Okay, I I see your
[1:38:32] request. I'm going allow you to touch
[1:38:34] those things. I'm allow you to take the
[1:38:36] children, take the wife, but I can't let
[1:38:39] you take Jo.
[1:38:40] &gt;&gt; See, he wanted to wipe Job all the way
[1:38:43] up.
[1:38:43] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen.
[1:38:45] &gt;&gt; He was watching everything. And that's
[1:38:47] how he do you tonight.
[1:38:48] &gt;&gt; He ain't here to just torture you. He'll
[1:38:51] torture your kids.
[1:38:52] &gt;&gt; He He'll go anybody in the house,
[1:38:54] anything that connected to you. That is
[1:38:57] what he want to do. Steal, kill, and
[1:38:59] destroy. Right.
[1:39:04] &gt;&gt; He says, "But thou has made a hedge
[1:39:07] about him
[1:39:08] &gt;&gt; and about his house."
[1:39:09] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:39:10] &gt;&gt; And about all that he have on every
[1:39:12] side.
[1:39:13] &gt;&gt; Thou has blessed the work of his hands.
[1:39:15] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:39:16] &gt;&gt; And his substance is increased in the
[1:39:18] land.
[1:39:18] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:39:19] &gt;&gt; But put forth thy hand now, and touch
[1:39:21] all that he have, and he will curse thee
[1:39:23] to thy face. And the Lord said unto
[1:39:26] Satan, Behold,
[1:39:27] &gt;&gt; all that he hath is in thy power. Only
[1:39:31] upon himself
[1:39:32] &gt;&gt; put not forth thy hand.
[1:39:35] &gt;&gt; So Satan went forth from thee.
[1:39:38] First Corinthians
[1:39:41] chapter 10:3 says, "There hath no
[1:39:44] temptation
[1:39:45] &gt;&gt; taken you,
[1:39:46] &gt;&gt; but such as is common to man."
[1:39:49] &gt;&gt; That's right. Say, "But God is faithful,
[1:39:51] &gt;&gt; who will not suffer you to be tempted.
[1:39:53] &gt;&gt; Above that you are able." That's right.
[1:39:56] &gt;&gt; But will with the temptation also make a
[1:39:59] way to escape
[1:40:00] &gt;&gt; that you may be able to bear it.
[1:40:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:04] &gt;&gt; He already made a way.
[1:40:05] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:40:06] &gt;&gt; He already made a way. Hallelujah.
[1:40:07] &gt;&gt; In the message of spiritual food in due
[1:40:09] season,
[1:40:10] &gt;&gt; my brother
[1:40:11] &gt;&gt; in 1965,
[1:40:13] &gt;&gt; paragraph 40, it says, "That's what
[1:40:16] these people had done in the days of
[1:40:18] Elijah, gotten away from the word. They
[1:40:21] thought they had the word, but they
[1:40:23] didn't have it." He say, so notice
[1:40:26] during the time that he was going to
[1:40:27] punish the unbeliever, he made a way for
[1:40:30] the believer.
[1:40:31] &gt;&gt; That's right. The same thing he does
[1:40:33] each time.
[1:40:34] &gt;&gt; In the days when he was going to destroy
[1:40:36] the world by water, he made a way of
[1:40:38] escape for Noah.
[1:40:39] &gt;&gt; In the days that he was going to drown
[1:40:41] Egypt, he made a way of escape across
[1:40:43] the sea for his people. How God makes
[1:40:46] his way. And and where there is no way,
[1:40:49] he is that way.
[1:40:51] &gt;&gt; He is that way.
[1:40:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:55] &gt;&gt; If you can turn to the book of Daniel.
[1:40:57] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:40:58] &gt;&gt; Turn to the book of Daniel. Glory to
[1:41:01] God.
[1:41:01] &gt;&gt; And all scriptures are inspired.
[1:41:06] &gt;&gt; And we found out that sometimes as
[1:41:09] Christians, we can have testimonies of
[1:41:11] of stories that don't be in the Bible.
[1:41:15] Your your testimony can be the the first
[1:41:17] testimony.
[1:41:19] &gt;&gt; Your testimony can be the first
[1:41:21] testimony. That's why you should always
[1:41:23] testify because you don't know who need
[1:41:26] to hear your testimony because later on
[1:41:28] down the road they might find theel in
[1:41:30] that same situation and can't go back to
[1:41:32] the Bible and relate to no scripture of
[1:41:34] nobody that had that situation. So
[1:41:37] through your testimony now your
[1:41:39] testimony becomes a scripture.
[1:41:42] &gt;&gt; Now they got a tie post to hold on to.
[1:41:44] Well, if my brother went through that,
[1:41:46] God can bring me through that. If my
[1:41:49] sister went through that, God can bring
[1:41:51] me through that.
[1:41:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:00] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:42:01] &gt;&gt; Daniel chapter 3:15.
[1:42:05] It says,
[1:42:07] we know this story real well. Real well.
[1:42:09] We know this story. He said, "Now if you
[1:42:11] be ready that at what time you hear the
[1:42:14] sound of the cornet,
[1:42:16] the flute,
[1:42:18] the heart, the sack, butt, soldery,
[1:42:22] &gt;&gt; and dustr, and all kinds of music,
[1:42:26] &gt;&gt; you fall down and worship the image
[1:42:29] which I have made." Whale on. But if you
[1:42:32] worship not, you shall be cast the same
[1:42:35] hour into the midst of a burning fiery
[1:42:38] furnace.
[1:42:40] And who is that God that shall deliver
[1:42:43] you out of my hands?
[1:42:50] &gt;&gt; Verse 16 says, "Shhatterite,
[1:42:52] Mach, and Abednego answered and said to
[1:42:55] the king, "Oh Nebuchadnezzar,
[1:42:58] &gt;&gt; we are not careful to answer thee
[1:43:00] &gt;&gt; in this matter.
[1:43:02] If it be so, our God whom we serve is
[1:43:05] able
[1:43:06] &gt;&gt; to deliver us from the burning fiery
[1:43:09] furnace. And he will deliver us out of
[1:43:13] thine hand,
[1:43:14] &gt;&gt; O king.
[1:43:15] &gt;&gt; But if not be,
[1:43:18] be it known unto thee, O king, that we
[1:43:21] would not serve thy gods, nor worship
[1:43:24] the golden image which thou hast set up.
[1:43:28] Then was Nebuchadnezzar full of fury
[1:43:31] &gt;&gt; and the form of his visage were changed
[1:43:33] against Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego.
[1:43:35] So he began to look at them different.
[1:43:38] &gt;&gt; So he began to see them in a whole
[1:43:39] different way from what from what he was
[1:43:41] looking at them because of the stand
[1:43:43] that they took.
[1:43:46] &gt;&gt; Because of the stand that they took.
[1:43:48] &gt;&gt; Therefore, he spake and commanded that
[1:43:50] they should heat the furnace seven times
[1:43:52] more than it than it was want to be
[1:43:55] heated. And he commanded the most mighty
[1:43:59] men.
[1:44:01] Look who he called.
[1:44:03] &gt;&gt; He called his most mighty men
[1:44:06] &gt;&gt; that were in his army to bind Shadrach,
[1:44:09] Meshach, and Abednego and to cast them
[1:44:11] into the burning fiery furnace.
[1:44:14] &gt;&gt; Now,
[1:44:18] his his request to to make this furnace
[1:44:21] hotter
[1:44:22] &gt;&gt; didn't even affect Shadrach, Meshach,
[1:44:24] and Abednego. Uh-huh.
[1:44:26] &gt;&gt; This request only affected his strongest
[1:44:28] men.
[1:44:29] &gt;&gt; And we going we're going to see that in
[1:44:30] a minute.
[1:44:32] &gt;&gt; Verse 21, it says, "Then these men were
[1:44:36] bound in their coats, their hoozing in
[1:44:38] their hats and their other garments, and
[1:44:41] were cast into the midst of the burning
[1:44:43] fiery furnace."
[1:44:45] &gt;&gt; Therefore, because the king's
[1:44:46] commandment was urgent. So, this this
[1:44:49] was nothing he planned. This was
[1:44:51] something he decided to do at that
[1:44:52] moment
[1:44:53] &gt;&gt; because of the stand. He decided to do
[1:44:56] that right then and there.
[1:44:59] &gt;&gt; So, so, so when you stand for this word,
[1:45:02] the the the enemy will come up with
[1:45:03] something right there on the spot.
[1:45:05] &gt;&gt; Right there on the spot. He don't need
[1:45:08] 24 hours to come up with something. He
[1:45:10] come up with something right there on
[1:45:12] the spot.
[1:45:14] &gt;&gt; So, see, we see who we dealing with
[1:45:16] here. Yes, sir. And then he said,
[1:45:18] "Because the king's commandment was
[1:45:20] urgent
[1:45:21] &gt;&gt; and the furnace is seeding hot,
[1:45:23] &gt;&gt; the flames of the fire slew, those men
[1:45:26] that took up Shar, Meshach, and
[1:45:28] Abednego."
[1:45:30] &gt;&gt; That was your sign right there that God
[1:45:32] was already there.
[1:45:34] &gt;&gt; We talking about the same fire,
[1:45:37] &gt;&gt; the same flames that the Hebrew boys w
[1:45:40] got cast through. That's right.
[1:45:42] &gt;&gt; The mighty gods died. So that tell you
[1:45:45] about that that God was already there.
[1:45:48] &gt;&gt; He had already made a way.
[1:45:51] &gt;&gt; And the Bible say and these three men,
[1:45:54] Shadrach, Meite, and Abednego, they fell
[1:45:57] down bound in the midst of the burning
[1:46:00] fiery furnace. They was in the presence
[1:46:02] of a higher caller.
[1:46:04] &gt;&gt; The fourth man was already in the fire.
[1:46:07] &gt;&gt; So what did they do? They fell down.
[1:46:10] They worshiped the fourth man in the
[1:46:12] fire. They began to worship him while
[1:46:15] they was bound. So, so when the king
[1:46:17] looked in there, no longer were they
[1:46:20] bound. They was loose and they was
[1:46:22] worshiping it. Walking in the fire.
[1:46:25] Walking in the fire. They was walking in
[1:46:28] the fire. But that was an example to you
[1:46:31] and me. When you find yourself in the
[1:46:33] fiery furnace, fall on your knees.
[1:46:37] Get on your knees and begin to worship
[1:46:40] God. begin to call on his name. Say,
[1:46:43] "Lord, I know you here. I know that you
[1:46:46] able." And begin your praise and
[1:46:48] worship. Then you begin to loosen your
[1:46:50] chains and then you'll be free and you
[1:46:53] can walk.
[1:46:55] [Applause]
[1:46:56] &gt;&gt; You begin to walk in the midst of your
[1:46:58] trials.
[1:47:00] &gt;&gt; You don't have to be bound just because
[1:47:02] you in a situation. You don't have to be
[1:47:05] bound because circumstances come on you.
[1:47:07] You got power to loose.
[1:47:10] Yes.
[1:47:12] &gt;&gt; Not when you get out the furnace. You
[1:47:14] got power to loose.
[1:47:16] &gt;&gt; While you in the middle of the battle,
[1:47:19] while you in the middle of the fire, you
[1:47:21] got the power to loose.
[1:47:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:27] &gt;&gt; No longer will we be bound tonight as
[1:47:29] Christians. No longer will we be bound.
[1:47:31] We got power to bind whatever we want to
[1:47:33] bind on earth. We got power to loose
[1:47:36] what we want to loose on earth. We got
[1:47:38] that power tonight.
[1:47:40] Don't let that balance or that trial get
[1:47:42] you trapped. Don't let it take your
[1:47:45] vision off. You got the power.
[1:47:48] &gt;&gt; You got the power.
[1:47:53] &gt;&gt; But it's to worship.
[1:47:55] You got to worship when you in that
[1:47:56] trial. You got to lift your hands up.
[1:47:59] You got to give God praise. You got to
[1:48:01] call on his name. You got to recognize
[1:48:04] that you are in the presence of a higher
[1:48:07] calling. You got to realize that there's
[1:48:09] somebody greater than you and I and that
[1:48:12] he's already made a way.
[1:48:16] &gt;&gt; They wasn't worshiping because they
[1:48:18] didn't know how they was going to get
[1:48:19] loose. They was worshiping because they
[1:48:21] know he already made a way. They knew he
[1:48:24] was in the fire. They went to worship
[1:48:26] him. They knew they was all right.
[1:48:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:48:35] [Applause]
[1:48:36] The Hebrew boys,
[1:48:39] &gt;&gt; see the See the guards that cast them in
[1:48:41] the fire.
[1:48:43] &gt;&gt; The the test wasn't for them.
[1:48:48] &gt;&gt; The test was for the Hebrew boys.
[1:48:52] &gt;&gt; That's why the fire slew them.
[1:48:54] &gt;&gt; It wasn't their test.
[1:48:57] &gt;&gt; You don't want You don't want to touch
[1:48:58] nobody else better.
[1:49:01] You you don't want what God got for
[1:49:03] somebody else.
[1:49:04] &gt;&gt; It was the Hebrew boys test.
[1:49:07] &gt;&gt; It was not their test.
[1:49:09] &gt;&gt; So they got involved with something that
[1:49:11] didn't even belong to them. That trial
[1:49:13] belonged to the Hebrew boys. That test
[1:49:16] belonged to the Hebrew boys. That fiery
[1:49:18] furnace belong to the Hebrew boys.
[1:49:27] stand
[1:49:30] right there.
[1:49:32] &gt;&gt; Everything that have ever made it to
[1:49:34] you,
[1:49:35] &gt;&gt; every test, every trial
[1:49:38] &gt;&gt; that has ever made it to you
[1:49:40] &gt;&gt; and that have ever will make it to you,
[1:49:44] &gt;&gt; God has already made a way.
[1:49:53] [Music]
[1:49:55] There's nothing that's going to make it
[1:49:56] to you that he has not already paved the
[1:49:59] way.
[1:50:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:50:02] &gt;&gt; And that and that's the mind you want to
[1:50:04] have.
[1:50:05] &gt;&gt; Only this realm tells you that he
[1:50:07] already made a way.
[1:50:09] &gt;&gt; And when you up there, you can worship
[1:50:10] in the midst of that trial.
[1:50:12] &gt;&gt; Oh, you can shout hallelujah in the
[1:50:14] midst of that trial.
[1:50:17] Cuz sometime it's going to be sometimes
[1:50:18] you going to walk in here and you gonna
[1:50:21] freely
[1:50:22] &gt;&gt; freely be able to lift your hands
[1:50:25] &gt;&gt; and shout hallelujah.
[1:50:27] &gt;&gt; But it's going to also be some days
[1:50:30] &gt;&gt; that when you come in here,
[1:50:32] &gt;&gt; it's going to take everything you got
[1:50:36] &gt;&gt; to lift them same hands
[1:50:38] &gt;&gt; to shout that same hallelujah.
[1:50:41] &gt;&gt; That's true.
[1:50:42] &gt;&gt; But just know he already made a way.
[1:50:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:50:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. Glory to God.
[1:50:49] &gt;&gt; And God God been showing us this all
[1:50:51] through the scriptures
[1:50:52] &gt;&gt; from Genesis to Revelation.
[1:50:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:55] &gt;&gt; What are you worried about? I have
[1:50:57] already made a way.
[1:50:59] &gt;&gt; And the enemy always come to reverse
[1:51:02] &gt;&gt; whatever it is that God does. So he
[1:51:05] talks you into that God has to find a
[1:51:07] way.
[1:51:08] &gt;&gt; Yeah. That he got to create a way. No,
[1:51:11] he already created. He already He just
[1:51:13] waiting for that for that season. Yes
[1:51:16] sir.
[1:51:16] &gt;&gt; That he will form your solution to your
[1:51:19] problem and he will bring it into
[1:51:20] action.
[1:51:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:22] &gt;&gt; Now in the book of Revelations chapter 4
[1:51:26] &gt;&gt; verse one.
[1:51:27] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:51:28] &gt;&gt; John says
[1:51:30] &gt;&gt; after this I looked
[1:51:33] &gt;&gt; and I and behold sir
[1:51:35] &gt;&gt; he say a door was open in heaven. He's
[1:51:37] saying, "The first voice which I heard
[1:51:39] was as it were of a trumpet sir
[1:51:42] &gt;&gt; talking with me,
[1:51:43] &gt;&gt; which says, "Come up hither,
[1:51:46] &gt;&gt; and I will show thee things which must
[1:51:48] be hereafter."
[1:51:50] &gt;&gt; So God was telling John, I can't talk to
[1:51:52] you down there.
[1:51:55] &gt;&gt; I can't communicate with you down there,
[1:51:57] John.
[1:51:59] &gt;&gt; John, I need you to come up
[1:52:01] &gt;&gt; in the spirit. I need you to get caught
[1:52:03] up in the spirit so I can communicate
[1:52:06] with you.
[1:52:07] God can't talk to you down here. He
[1:52:10] needs you to come up,
[1:52:12] &gt;&gt; get in the spirit
[1:52:13] &gt;&gt; so he can show you the things that he
[1:52:15] want to show you.
[1:52:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen.
[1:52:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:24] &gt;&gt; Revelation chapter 4, jump to verse 10
[1:52:28] for time sake. Jump to verse 10.
[1:52:30] Revelation 4:10. It says, "The four and
[1:52:35] 20 elders fell down before him that sat
[1:52:38] on the throne and worshiped him that
[1:52:40] liveth forever and ever, and cast their
[1:52:43] crowns before the throne, saying, Thou
[1:52:45] are worthy, oh Lord, to receive glory,
[1:52:50] honor, and power.
[1:52:52] &gt;&gt; For thou has created all things for thy
[1:52:55] pleasure they are and were created."
[1:53:00] The song was sung tonight. My hallelujah
[1:53:02] belongs to you.
[1:53:04] &gt;&gt; Your hallelujah don't even belong to
[1:53:05] you.
[1:53:08] &gt;&gt; Your worship don't even belong to you.
[1:53:10] &gt;&gt; All these things belong to God.
[1:53:18] &gt;&gt; In the book of Revelations,
[1:53:20] &gt;&gt; let's go to chapter five.
[1:53:21] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:53:22] &gt;&gt; Chapter 5.
[1:53:23] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:53:23] &gt;&gt; Verse one.
[1:53:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:27] Watch John. God is dealing with John.
[1:53:29] Yes, sir.
[1:53:30] &gt;&gt; He said, "I saw in the right hand of him
[1:53:32] that sat on the throne a book
[1:53:35] &gt;&gt; written within and on the backside
[1:53:38] sealed with seven seals."
[1:53:39] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:53:40] &gt;&gt; He said, "I saw a strong angel
[1:53:42] proclaiming with a loud voice
[1:53:45] &gt;&gt; who is worthy to open the book
[1:53:48] &gt;&gt; and to loose the seals thereof."
[1:53:51] &gt;&gt; Looks like a potential problem.
[1:53:52] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:53:54] &gt;&gt; Here we go again. And it looks like a
[1:53:55] potential problem.
[1:53:56] &gt;&gt; And he says, "And no man in heaven nor
[1:53:58] in earth, neither under the earth, was
[1:54:01] able to open the book, neither to look
[1:54:03] thereon."
[1:54:05] &gt;&gt; And John says, "And I wept much,
[1:54:08] &gt;&gt; because no man was found worthy to open
[1:54:11] and to read the book, needed to look
[1:54:13] thereon."
[1:54:15] &gt;&gt; And one of the elders said unto me,
[1:54:17] "Weep not
[1:54:19] &gt;&gt; weep not." Hallelujah.
[1:54:20] &gt;&gt; It says, "Behold,
[1:54:22] &gt;&gt; the lion
[1:54:23] &gt;&gt; of the tribe of Judah,
[1:54:25] &gt;&gt; the root of David,
[1:54:27] &gt;&gt; have prevailed to open the book and to
[1:54:30] loose the seven seals thereof." So the
[1:54:33] elder were telling John, "John, why are
[1:54:35] you weeping for? Why are you weeping for
[1:54:38] that?" What look like a problem to you?
[1:54:40] Let me show you. God has already made a
[1:54:42] way for this.
[1:54:44] &gt;&gt; He has already made a way for this.
[1:54:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen.
[1:54:51] &gt;&gt; Wonderful. Amen.
[1:54:52] &gt;&gt; And verse six says, "And I beheld sir,
[1:54:55] &gt;&gt; and lo, in the midst of the throne, and
[1:54:57] of the four beasts, and in the midst of
[1:54:59] the elders stood a lamb, as it had been
[1:55:02] slain, having seven horns, and seven
[1:55:06] eyes, which are the seven spirits of God
[1:55:08] sent forth into all the earth." That's
[1:55:10] right.
[1:55:11] &gt;&gt; And he came and took the book
[1:55:13] &gt;&gt; out of the right hand of him that sit
[1:55:15] upon the throne.
[1:55:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. Verse 8 says, "And when he had
[1:55:18] taken the book, sir,
[1:55:19] &gt;&gt; the four beasts and four and 20 elders
[1:55:22] fell down before the lamb,
[1:55:24] &gt;&gt; having every one of them harps and
[1:55:26] golden vows full of orders and which are
[1:55:28] the prayers of saints." And they sung a
[1:55:31] new song, saying, Thou are worthy to
[1:55:34] take the book
[1:55:36] &gt;&gt; and to open the seals thereof. For thou
[1:55:38] was slain, and has redeemed us to God by
[1:55:42] the blood out of every kindred and
[1:55:45] tongue and people and nations,
[1:55:47] &gt;&gt; and has made us into our God, kings and
[1:55:52] priests,
[1:55:53] &gt;&gt; and we shall reign on the earth. God had
[1:55:56] already made a way for you to be kings
[1:55:59] and priests before the foundation of the
[1:56:02] world.
[1:56:04] &gt;&gt; Before the foundation of the world, that
[1:56:05] was your position.
[1:56:08] &gt;&gt; So if you if you not operate for that,
[1:56:10] come up higher tonight. Come up higher.
[1:56:14] Increase your prayer life tonight. Come
[1:56:16] up higher. Increase your prayer life and
[1:56:19] come up higher.
[1:56:27] Amen.
[1:56:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:56:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:56:34] &gt;&gt; And I can't leave Revelations 10 out.
[1:56:37] Revelation chapter 10.
[1:56:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:56:39] &gt;&gt; And we we see how this thing is working
[1:56:41] all together.
[1:56:43] &gt;&gt; Verse um chapter 10 verse one.
[1:56:45] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.
[1:56:45] &gt;&gt; And and and he says here, he said, "I
[1:56:47] saw another mighty angel
[1:56:50] &gt;&gt; come down from heaven."
[1:56:51] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. clothed with a cloud, and a
[1:56:54] rainbow was upon his head. And his face
[1:56:56] was as it were the sun, and his feet as
[1:56:58] pillars of fire. And he had in his hand
[1:57:01] a little book open, and he set his right
[1:57:03] foot upon the sea, and his left foot on
[1:57:06] the earth, and cried with a loud voice,
[1:57:08] as when a lion roar. And when he had
[1:57:11] cried, seven thundersed their voices.
[1:57:14] &gt;&gt; And when the seven thunders had ordered
[1:57:16] their voices, I was about to write. John
[1:57:19] said he was about to write. Yeah.
[1:57:20] &gt;&gt; He said, "But and I heard a voice from
[1:57:22] heaven saying unto me,
[1:57:24] &gt;&gt; seal up those things
[1:57:26] &gt;&gt; which the seven thunders uttered and
[1:57:27] write them not."
[1:57:30] &gt;&gt; What I want you to see, even though the
[1:57:32] seven thunders was right there, it
[1:57:33] wasn't the appointed time yet.
[1:57:36] &gt;&gt; The seventh angel had not came on the
[1:57:38] scene yet.
[1:57:40] &gt;&gt; The prophet had not come on the scene
[1:57:41] yet. But the seven thunders that the
[1:57:44] prophet needed, God had already made a
[1:57:46] way
[1:57:48] &gt;&gt; before he got there. He had already made
[1:57:50] a way. He had already made the message
[1:57:52] before the messenger got there.
[1:57:59] &gt;&gt; Yes, my brother.
[1:58:00] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:58:00] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:58:02] &gt;&gt; Already there. Yes, my brother.
[1:58:05] In the message Revelations chapter 4
[1:58:08] part 1 1960
[1:58:10] he says now immediately
[1:58:13] paragraph 117
[1:58:15] he says now immediately after he showed
[1:58:17] the end of the age of his work here he
[1:58:20] went on up into heaven he said I'll show
[1:58:23] you what's going to be after this
[1:58:25] &gt;&gt; sir
[1:58:25] &gt;&gt; after the church ages he said John I
[1:58:28] can't talk to you down there no more cuz
[1:58:31] I left him down here he said I've come
[1:58:33] up higher Uh-huh.
[1:58:34] &gt;&gt; He said, "Come out here with me."
[1:58:36] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.
[1:58:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:38] &gt;&gt; He said, "I'll show you what's going to
[1:58:40] take place hereafter."
[1:58:41] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:58:42] &gt;&gt; Oh my. Caught up in the vision, caught
[1:58:45] up into glory. Yes, sir.
[1:58:47] &gt;&gt; And God was saying, "I can't show you
[1:58:48] these things
[1:58:50] &gt;&gt; with a corner mind."
[1:58:52] &gt;&gt; He can't He can't show you these things
[1:58:54] with a corner mind. You got to come up
[1:58:55] higher.
[1:58:57] &gt;&gt; You got to come up higher.
[1:58:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen.
[1:59:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's turn
[1:59:04] let's turn to the book of St. John
[1:59:09] chapter 17.
[1:59:12] &gt;&gt; We're going we're going to try to tie it
[1:59:14] up.
[1:59:16] &gt;&gt; We're going to try to tie it up. St.
[1:59:19] John chapter 17 verse one.
[1:59:21] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:59:23] &gt;&gt; See the Bible say you have not cuz you
[1:59:24] ask not.
[1:59:28] And sometimes, even though it already
[1:59:30] exists,
[1:59:31] &gt;&gt; and that God already made a way,
[1:59:34] &gt;&gt; sometime you still got to ask for it.
[1:59:37] &gt;&gt; There's nothing wrong with asking for
[1:59:39] it.
[1:59:42] &gt;&gt; Verse one says,
[1:59:43] &gt;&gt; "These words spake Jesus."
[1:59:46] &gt;&gt; And he lifted up his eyes to heaven and
[1:59:49] said, "Father,
[1:59:50] &gt;&gt; the hour is come."
[1:59:52] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:59:53] &gt;&gt; Glorify thy son. Uh-huh.
[1:59:55] &gt;&gt; That thy son also may glorify thee.
[1:59:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:58] &gt;&gt; Then verse two says, he says, "As thou
[2:00:01] has given him power over all flesh,
[2:00:04] &gt;&gt; that he should give eternal life to as
[2:00:07] many as thou has given him."
[2:00:09] &gt;&gt; And verse three says, "And this is life
[2:00:12] eternal,
[2:00:13] &gt;&gt; that they may know thee, the only true
[2:00:15] God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou has
[2:00:18] sent." Uh-huh.
[2:00:20] &gt;&gt; Verse four say, "I have glorified thee
[2:00:23] on the earth."
[2:00:24] &gt;&gt; He says, "I have finished the work which
[2:00:27] thou gavest me to do."
[2:00:28] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:00:29] &gt;&gt; And verse five is what what I want you
[2:00:30] to see. He says, "Now, oh father,
[2:00:32] glorify thou me
[2:00:34] &gt;&gt; with thy own self with the glory which I
[2:00:38] had with thee before the world was."
[2:00:41] &gt;&gt; So Jesus began to ask for something
[2:00:45] &gt;&gt; that already existed.
[2:00:49] He didn't ask God for a new glory.
[2:00:52] &gt;&gt; He didn't ask him to create a new glory.
[2:00:54] He said, "I want that same glory.
[2:00:57] &gt;&gt; The same glory that we had before the
[2:01:00] foundation of the world." So when I find
[2:01:03] myself sick, I don't ask God for a new
[2:01:05] healing. I ask him for that same
[2:01:08] healing.
[2:01:10] &gt;&gt; Lord, give me that same healing that me
[2:01:13] and you had from the foundation of the
[2:01:16] world. So whatever you need, you be
[2:01:18] specific about it. God already made a
[2:01:21] way. Ask him for the specific thing that
[2:01:24] you need cuz you came from God and you
[2:01:27] going back to God. Everything he had
[2:01:30] before the foundation of the world, he
[2:01:32] already made a way.
[2:01:34] &gt;&gt; Already made a way.
[2:01:40] &gt;&gt; And I'm I'm close up with this quote
[2:01:43] right here. this quote God's provided
[2:01:44] way in 1953.
[2:01:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:48] &gt;&gt; Paragraph 45.
[2:01:50] It says, "There are some people one time
[2:01:54] that was worried about Jesus going
[2:01:56] away." And Jesus said, "Don't worry.
[2:02:00] I've made a way for you."
[2:02:02] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.
[2:02:02] &gt;&gt; A little while and the world won't see
[2:02:04] me no more.
[2:02:06] &gt;&gt; Yet you will see me
[2:02:07] &gt;&gt; for I'll be with you
[2:02:09] &gt;&gt; even in you
[2:02:10] &gt;&gt; to the end of the world.
[2:02:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. He says, "Well, how you going to
[2:02:13] be with us
[2:02:15] &gt;&gt; and not in the world?" I can't
[2:02:17] understand. Says, "I tell you what you
[2:02:19] do. You want to get in God's provided
[2:02:22] way." Sure, you just go up there to that
[2:02:26] at the Jerusalem and wait there until
[2:02:28] the Holy Ghost comes.
[2:02:30] &gt;&gt; He said, "Well, how's the Holy Ghost
[2:02:31] going to come?" "I don't know.
[2:02:34] &gt;&gt; You just go there and wait."
[2:02:36] &gt;&gt; He said, "How long we going to wait
[2:02:38] until?" He said, "Well, do you mean two
[2:02:41] hours?" He said, "No, until." He said,
[2:02:43] "Maybe just a week." "No, until." Until
[2:02:46] what? Until you endure with power from
[2:02:48] on high.
[2:02:50] &gt;&gt; Give the Lord a great big hand of clap
[2:02:52] for praise.
[2:02:53] He's already made a way.
[2:02:59] &gt;&gt; He's already made a way.
[2:03:03] &gt;&gt; Let us bow our heads with a quick word
[2:03:04] of prayer.
[2:03:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. Dear heavenly father, oh God, we
[2:03:09] are thankful tonight, Lord Jesus. Oh
[2:03:11] Lord God, you have took your scriptures,
[2:03:13] oh God, and your word, oh father, and
[2:03:15] you have came down and you spoke to your
[2:03:17] children, oh father. Oh God, you have
[2:03:19] shown us in your word, oh God, that why
[2:03:21] should we worry, oh father, oh God, when
[2:03:24] you have already made a way, oh Lord
[2:03:26] God, we pray, oh God, in our approaching
[2:03:28] to you, oh father, that we would go to
[2:03:30] you, oh God, knowing that you've already
[2:03:31] made that way or provided that which we
[2:03:34] need, oh God. Oh Lord God, help us to be
[2:03:36] specific when we come to you, oh Lord
[2:03:38] God, that when we ask for something, oh
[2:03:40] God, knowing, oh God, that it ain't
[2:03:42] something that's so far-fetched, oh God,
[2:03:43] that you got to go out and look for it,
[2:03:45] oh father, but know and trust and
[2:03:47] believe, oh God, that you have already
[2:03:48] have what we need, oh Lord God, you say
[2:03:51] those that couldn't you must believe
[2:03:53] that you are who you say you are, oh
[2:03:55] Lord God, and that you are rewarded for
[2:03:57] those who diligently seek you, oh Lord
[2:03:58] Jesus. Oh God, we are diligently seeking
[2:04:01] you tonight, oh father. Oh God, some
[2:04:03] somebody needs joy tonight. God, we
[2:04:05] asking for you to restore joy tonight.
[2:04:08] Oh Lord God, we asking for you to
[2:04:09] restore happiness tonight. Oh Lord God,
[2:04:12] Lord God, we put these things before you
[2:04:13] tonight, oh Lord God, that you would
[2:04:15] strengthen every feeble body in here
[2:04:16] tonight, oh Lord God. Oh God, that you
[2:04:18] would touch and heal every sickness in
[2:04:20] the building tonight, oh Lord God, that
[2:04:22] we will walk out of here, oh Lord God,
[2:04:23] claiming that healing that you had
[2:04:25] already given us from the foundation of
[2:04:27] the world. Lord God, we be careful to
[2:04:29] give you all the praise, honor, and
[2:04:30] glory if we lift your name up on high.
[2:04:33] Oh God, in the mighty name of Jesus
[2:04:35] Christ, we thank you and we love you.
[2:04:36] Amen. Put your hands together.
[2:04:41] [Applause]
[2:04:44] &gt;&gt; Stephen,
[2:04:51] &gt;&gt; wonderful. Amen. Amen. Amen. Glory to
[2:04:55] God
[2:04:56] in water.
[2:04:58] Praise God. Praise God. Praise God.
[2:05:01] Amen.
[2:05:02] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[2:05:02] &gt;&gt; God already made a way.
[2:05:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. In other words, your solution is
[2:05:07] before you even get to the problem.
[2:05:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:12] &gt;&gt; Why do you send the most
[2:05:15] mighty men of your army to bond normal
[2:05:20] people?
[2:05:24] In other word, if you want the uh to
[2:05:26] make it simple, if they want to catch
[2:05:28] you to arrest you, they going to call a
[2:05:31] Navy Seal.
[2:05:32] &gt;&gt; Why are they calling a Navy Seal
[2:05:34] &gt;&gt; to to to arrest you?
[2:05:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:38] &gt;&gt; Usually, if you call a national guard,
[2:05:41] it means that you're dealing with
[2:05:42] something at the highest level.
[2:05:44] &gt;&gt; So why do you call the elite
[2:05:47] &gt;&gt; to come to normal people? So
[2:05:49] Nebuchadnezzar knew
[2:05:51] &gt;&gt; that these people are not really normal.
[2:05:55] They were mighty men. So you need the
[2:05:57] most mighty man
[2:05:59] &gt;&gt; to come and handle mighty man. You see
[2:06:02] the the the the
[2:06:04] other side knows you even better than
[2:06:06] yourself.
[2:06:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:06:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. demon knew Jesus Christ
[2:06:12] &gt;&gt; and they were recognizing Jesus Christ
[2:06:15] and they were confessing Jesus Christ
[2:06:17] and the one that had a problem were
[2:06:19] religious people
[2:06:21] &gt;&gt; to recognize Jesus Christ.
[2:06:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:06:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:06:25] &gt;&gt; God already made a way.
[2:06:28] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[2:06:29] &gt;&gt; It was sung already in the song. Brother
[2:06:31] Brandham say singing was already
[2:06:33] preaching the gospel. The gospel was
[2:06:35] preached. Did you talk to brother Tony
[2:06:37] about singing you made a way? He didn't
[2:06:40] even talk to brother Tony. So that is
[2:06:42] the Holy Spirit confirming to you. Amen.
[2:06:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. Spend your time right here.
[2:06:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:06:50] &gt;&gt; Pray it up. Stay under the spirit. Stay
[2:06:53] consecrating yourself and keep yourself
[2:06:55] right here. This is where you see things
[2:06:58] differently. This is where you believe
[2:07:00] things that a normal human being can
[2:07:03] never believe. Never never believe.
[2:07:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. When everybody say it's
[2:07:09] impossible, that's exactly what you
[2:07:12] believe.
[2:07:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. We got a problem when we were
[2:07:17] trapped in this place right here. Amen.
[2:07:20] And the Holy Spirit is telling you, be
[2:07:22] aware of this mind right here because
[2:07:24] the flesh here, this is where your
[2:07:26] carnal mind is. And the Bible say the
[2:07:28] corner man is enmity.
[2:07:30] &gt;&gt; In other words, they don't get along.
[2:07:32] And God is telling you be aware of that
[2:07:36] corner man. Amen. Maybe one day the Lord
[2:07:39] will allow us. I was meditating today.
[2:07:41] Just meditating. I say one day I need to
[2:07:43] talk to you about what you call reality.
[2:07:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:50] What you call reality. What is reality?
[2:07:53] Amen. It's a big big trouble.
[2:07:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. What you call facts.
[2:08:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. This is what God is challenging
[2:08:05] tonight.
[2:08:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. Either you're going to believe God
[2:08:10] or you're going to believe the corner
[2:08:12] mind. But the corner mind is very
[2:08:15] limited. Amen. Amen.
[2:08:18] &gt;&gt; There is no way this one can declare
[2:08:21] God.
[2:08:23] This was not meant to declare God.
[2:08:26] &gt;&gt; It was meant to declare this world,
[2:08:29] &gt;&gt; not God.
[2:08:30] &gt;&gt; Go listen to the message the six sense
[2:08:34] &gt;&gt; and the super sense and you will begin
[2:08:36] to to grasp what is going on. Amen.
[2:08:40] &gt;&gt; If they take your eyes away,
[2:08:43] Amen. I can preach from the morning to
[2:08:46] the evening and tell you there is a
[2:08:47] pulpit here.
[2:08:48] &gt;&gt; You won't see it.
[2:08:50] The reason why is you don't have a
[2:08:52] decoder
[2:08:55] &gt;&gt; to see the pulpit
[2:08:57] &gt;&gt; until you get the eyes. Then you can
[2:08:59] tell. But you may use your hand to touch
[2:09:02] it.
[2:09:03] &gt;&gt; But you must have a preview of the
[2:09:06] pulpit before your eyes were taken out.
[2:09:09] &gt;&gt; Let's stop right there. Amen. Amen.
[2:09:12] Maybe one day we will get into what you
[2:09:14] call reality to kind of free you and
[2:09:17] start believing things that this brand
[2:09:20] here is so tiny like this to believe it.
[2:09:24] That's what God is talking to us
[2:09:26] tonight. Amen. Live in the first realm.
[2:09:30] You are God. Just know you've been
[2:09:32] trapped into a body and that body have a
[2:09:35] corner man. And the corner man will
[2:09:38] continue to make you think and treat God
[2:09:41] like a man who who who who is surprised
[2:09:45] about your your trial. In other words,
[2:09:48] God didn't know and you you the one
[2:09:50] explaining to God, you know, you know,
[2:09:52] you didn't know what is happening to me.
[2:09:54] God already knew. God already made a
[2:09:56] way. God knew we going to be in this
[2:09:58] church right here. We're going to be in
[2:10:00] this building. He knew the color of the
[2:10:02] carpet. Even when we were sitting and
[2:10:04] then going back and forth to decide the
[2:10:06] carpet, he already knew.
[2:10:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's why prophetic
[2:10:12] people were different because they could
[2:10:14] see the vision and brother Brandham will
[2:10:17] sit down until grandma sit on the chair.
[2:10:20] &gt;&gt; You can pray pray pray pray. Brother
[2:10:22] Brandham is just sitting waiting for
[2:10:24] grand. He won't pray until grandma is
[2:10:25] sitting there.
[2:10:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:10:28] &gt;&gt; Because what? because he climb up higher
[2:10:30] to get the mind of Christ.
[2:10:33] &gt;&gt; And when you get the mind of Christ, you
[2:10:35] are behaving differently. You become an
[2:10:37] oddball even though you living in the
[2:10:40] human being. That is what God is telling
[2:10:43] us tonight. It's it's go back home and
[2:10:45] then go through the scripture. You can
[2:10:47] take the life of Gideon. You will see
[2:10:49] how Gideon was in seven and it took the
[2:10:52] angel of the Lord to pump Gideon to
[2:10:54] bring him out like mighty man of a me
[2:10:57] mighty man of valor. But was God looking
[2:11:00] at you or was God looking at you?
[2:11:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:11:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's what God is telling us
[2:11:08] tonight. He already made a way for your
[2:11:11] situation. I know sometime when
[2:11:13] situation take longer, we get used to
[2:11:16] it. We cope. We adjust. We rearrange
[2:11:19] everything to accept it. But God can
[2:11:23] challenge those situation and show you
[2:11:25] that he already made a way. It doesn't
[2:11:29] matter how long it took it takes. It
[2:11:32] doesn't matter how dark it is. It
[2:11:34] doesn't matter how odd it is that no one
[2:11:37] ever came out of a situation like this.
[2:11:41] You can break that circle and just tell
[2:11:43] him that there is no way you can tell me
[2:11:45] that you made a way and there is no way
[2:11:49] for me. There got to be a way for me to
[2:11:52] come out of this situation. There got to
[2:11:55] be a way for me to receive what I'm
[2:11:57] believing. Amen. There got to be a way.
[2:12:00] That's the reason why you are talking to
[2:12:02] me tonight. There must be a way for me
[2:12:05] to come out of this situation. Amen.
[2:12:08] Amen.
[2:12:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. And I'm going to warn you. If I
[2:12:13] didn't start this church, God started
[2:12:15] this church. If you ever have an idea of
[2:12:19] coming to this church
[2:12:21] &gt;&gt; and get settled,
[2:12:23] &gt;&gt; you will leave this church.
[2:12:25] &gt;&gt; This church will never let you settle.
[2:12:28] &gt;&gt; When you climb, you think that okay, now
[2:12:30] you there. Tomorrow God pushes you up
[2:12:33] again and you go back up again and
[2:12:35] tomorrow God. So in other words, don't
[2:12:37] never think like, oh, now we have
[2:12:39] arrived. Now we go to church. We see
[2:12:41] this is what happened all over the
[2:12:43] message. People got used to the church.
[2:12:46] They know their spot. They know where
[2:12:48] they sit. They left their coffee uh
[2:12:51] stuff and the church become like a
[2:12:53] religion. They go on Sunday just sit
[2:12:55] listen to the sermon. It's like a
[2:12:56] preacher shouting, shouting, shouting
[2:12:58] and we come out and then we go back
[2:13:00] again and it become a religion. This one
[2:13:03] is different.
[2:13:04] &gt;&gt; Whenever you feel like okay now I feel
[2:13:06] like ah I progress in my spiritual walk.
[2:13:10] Tomorrow he comes and show you again
[2:13:12] another thing. So you keep climbing
[2:13:13] right until we will leave. In other
[2:13:16] word, don't never That's why if you
[2:13:18] don't keep up with what I'm telling you,
[2:13:20] you're going to get tired.
[2:13:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. If you pray one hour, he
[2:13:25] will push you to two hours. If you pray
[2:13:27] two hours, he will push you to three
[2:13:29] hour. God will never never stop. Amen.
[2:13:33] That's why the scripture continue to unf
[2:13:37] for 4 months. Lord came tonight again to
[2:13:40] show you that again with Psalm 32 I mean
[2:13:43] 82 let's push it again. So never never
[2:13:46] think of this church like okay we have
[2:13:48] arrived we have a fellowship oh now
[2:13:51] everything is something will come back
[2:13:54] up if we have the fellowship oh the
[2:13:56] building full now we need another
[2:13:57] building ah another project of course
[2:14:02] have I said something wrong
[2:14:04] &gt;&gt; have I said something wrong because when
[2:14:06] you see that oh now everything is good
[2:14:08] boom another project come up what is
[2:14:10] going on again no it is God remove
[2:14:14] spirit of religion out of this church.
[2:14:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. This will never become common to
[2:14:20] you that you know okay we sing one song,
[2:14:23] two song, three song. That's why you get
[2:14:25] trouble sometime when when when you get
[2:14:28] here and it's brother John singing more
[2:14:29] than one song or or who who the set
[2:14:34] leading song a different way because you
[2:14:36] want to put God in a box like in a stuff
[2:14:39] like this. No no no no no no. It won't
[2:14:42] happen like that. Amen. It won't happen
[2:14:45] like that. It will continue to change
[2:14:48] because he's the present God. He is I am
[2:14:52] &gt;&gt; the God of the present day. In other
[2:14:55] way, last Sunday was last Sunday. This
[2:14:57] coming Sunday is another Sunday, a new
[2:15:00] day, another fresh message from the Lord
[2:15:03] for you together. Amen.
[2:15:04] &gt;&gt; So remove the religious spirit
[2:15:07] &gt;&gt; of getting used to church and getting
[2:15:09] comfortable.
[2:15:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. It is squeezing me. It's squeezing
[2:15:12] the deacon. It's squeezing the trusty
[2:15:14] squeezing everybody. In other words, you
[2:15:16] cannot sit to say ah now I feel like no.
[2:15:19] Every time you nerve, every time you
[2:15:21] want to preach here, you begin to feel
[2:15:22] that tension again. You can never get to
[2:15:25] a point you say, "Ah, now I know how to
[2:15:27] preach. I can just go there, go sleep."
[2:15:29] No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. That
[2:15:31] pressure, that tension have to continue
[2:15:34] to be there all the time. Amen. And we
[2:15:37] going from glory to glory, from glory to
[2:15:41] glory, from glory to. And then when you
[2:15:43] look behind, you say, "Oh my God, look
[2:15:46] where I was." Look, look, look, look.
[2:15:48] Look at me. Three, four years. You can
[2:15:50] do that. That's true.
[2:15:51] &gt;&gt; But remember, you have not reached there
[2:15:53] yet.
[2:15:53] &gt;&gt; That's why the rapture have not happened
[2:15:55] yet.
[2:15:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:15:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:15:59] &gt;&gt; Stay on the spiritual mind. This is what
[2:16:02] God want you to understand. God already
[2:16:05] made a way. Let's pray. Heavenly Father,
[2:16:09] Lord, we are approaching you tonight,
[2:16:11] Father. Lord, thanking you for your
[2:16:13] grace, your love, your mercy, for such a
[2:16:16] powerful message, Lord, that you have
[2:16:18] made a way, Lord. You did it in Genesis.
[2:16:22] You did it, Lord, Father, for the Hebrew
[2:16:25] children. You did it, Lord, Father, for
[2:16:28] Elijah when he was so scared. But you
[2:16:31] already had a solution for Jezebel,
[2:16:33] Lord. Father, you did it, Lord. Even
[2:16:36] when we were looking for a redeemer,
[2:16:38] Father, you already knew. You had that
[2:16:40] lamb already prepared, hidden, Lord,
[2:16:43] Father, in the holiest. And it was just
[2:16:46] about time for the lamb to come. And
[2:16:48] John was weeping. And Father, John have
[2:16:51] to talk to John to tell John not to weep
[2:16:55] because, oh God, you already made a way,
[2:16:58] Lord. Father, help us up Lord to remain
[2:17:01] spiritual, to remain consecrated, Lord,
[2:17:04] to live in a world different, Lord,
[2:17:07] Father, than what we are living now,
[2:17:09] Lord, because this time is a gross
[2:17:12] darkness, but it's a most glorious time,
[2:17:14] Lord, that you are requiring your
[2:17:17] children, Lord, Father, to come up
[2:17:19] higher so that you can show to us
[2:17:21] vision, dreams, and things can be more
[2:17:24] clear in our life until when we wake up
[2:17:27] in the morning, we know for certainty
[2:17:29] without Lord guessing left and right
[2:17:32] what to do and what is the next step to
[2:17:34] take in our life. Father may you
[2:17:36] strengthen our brother. Lord may you
[2:17:38] protect him Lord Jesus. May you give us
[2:17:41] all travel mercy and remove any attack
[2:17:44] from the world of darkness. Father I
[2:17:46] know that when we have started to get
[2:17:48] deeper into this channel of prayer, the
[2:17:51] enemy is Lord troubling left and right.
[2:17:54] But father tonight you spoke to us that
[2:17:56] you already made a way. And Lord, we are
[2:17:58] asking for that way that you have made
[2:18:00] for this time of the season that you may
[2:18:03] dispatch again heaven, Lord, and remove
[2:18:06] the enemy completely away from us, Lord,
[2:18:08] and keep us center into your word, Lord,
[2:18:11] and protect us. We are committing
[2:18:13] everything and the remaining of the weak
[2:18:15] unto the hand. Those that needed travel
[2:18:18] mercy, Father, may you give it to them.
[2:18:20] our family, Sister Lily, and Lord
[2:18:22] Father, remembering again, Lord, Father,
[2:18:24] Sister Edie, where she is. And there is
[2:18:26] nothing that is impossible. Whatever
[2:18:29] she's going through, Lord, Father, we've
[2:18:31] uh uh uh her mother, Lord, our precious
[2:18:35] sister, you already made a way, Father,
[2:18:38] Lord Jesus Christ, you're not a God of
[2:18:40] near only, but you are also a God of a
[2:18:43] far away. Father, Lord, may you touch,
[2:18:46] Lord, Father, and come down over there
[2:18:48] in a supernatural way. Lord, we thank
[2:18:51] you for everything. Touch what they
[2:18:53] said. Lord, Father, we rebuke the enemy
[2:18:56] that have come against him, Lord.
[2:18:57] Father, we pray that you lose him
[2:19:00] completely in the name of Jesus Christ.
[2:19:03] Father, protect us all under your blood,
[2:19:05] Lord, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.
[2:19:10] Go ahead, John. Thank you.
[2:19:16] You don't have to worry
[2:19:21] &gt;&gt; and don't you be afraid.
[2:19:27] Joy comes in the morning.
[2:19:32] Troubles they don't last always.
[2:19:37] For there's a friend named Jesus
[2:19:42] who will wipe your tears away.
[2:19:48] &gt;&gt; And if your heart is broken,
[2:19:53] &gt;&gt; just lift your hands and say,
[2:19:58] "Oh, I know that I can make it.
[2:20:03] I know that I can stand.
[2:20:08] No matter what may come my way,
[2:20:14] my life is in your hands.
[2:20:19] With Jesus, I can take it.
[2:20:24] With him, I know I can stand.
[2:20:28] No matter what may come my way,
[2:20:34] my life is in your hands.
