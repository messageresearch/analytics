yesterday good food everything glory to God amen so congratulations I'm proud of you maybe one of this day I need to take you to a restaurant or a city just talk right okay you don't want it that's fine I'll keep my money amen how many are up to date with the sermon let me see your hand okay how many are reading the Cod book praise God and the church ages glory to God we're moving pretty good amen remember October the 1st it's the family days for the children we will have some time for them and when we finish we come into the century and pray for them so the Lord can bless them again for the school year amen the next house meeting is on October the 29th brother Kelly are we okay October 29th how many people heard me October 29th so do everything you can to be there because what we spoke about yesterday you lost it and I know many people in this message and even outside the message you're suffering for that the life of pretense I cannot go back and sit with you and talk one hour and a half or two hours to give you what you miss yesterday I am not responsible we usually give you one month and keep telling you ahead of time we have a house meeting we have a house meeting we have a house meeting so you know what to do I don't have your blood in my hand okay let me Rob you pretty good because you don't want to say a man sit down please open Luke chapter 10. then you're going to say Amen if I rob you the wrong way be my guest because I'm a pastor I don't want to face your maker one of this day with your blood because I didn't tell you the truth amen I will tell you the truth and that truth will set you free and it's up to you to accept it based on your free moral agency or rejected if you accept it praise the Lord if you rejected the blood as a Watchman doesn't it's not in my hand because sometimes we create situation ourselves duck causes you to be in trouble with God amen you don't get me sometimes we ourselves you can be free in your life and you create something in your own life and what you created now begin to block your spiritual life maybe you were reading the Bible before and you put yourself into a a club in school and because of that club you cannot read again your Bible you cause yourself trouble that's it you want to belong to a society but that Society trouble your spiritual work I'm going to read it and may God speak to you it's Luke chapter 10 verse 39 now I believe the spiritual eye will catch it amen somebody already got it right you got it the Bible says and she had a sister called Mary which also satire Brad Angelo can you take this so whether you want to say a man or not I have somebody and she had a sister thank you brother David called Mary which also sat where Jesus Mary and Martha both of them were sisters everybody okay but when Jesus came to their home each sister chose their own place everybody okay one chose the feet of Jesus and Marta chose a certain place but if you look Naturally Speaking there is nothing wrong that Marta done watch and she had a sister call Mary which also sat at Jesus feet and heard water so Jesus was in this house and Jesus was talking and the word that came out of Jesus we know it's the word of eternal life so Jesus was having a service in this house your boss just drop it to me now Jesus was having a house meeting he just dropped right now that's why I'm saying that Jesus was having a house meeting amen and Mary chose to be at the house meeting right at the feet of Jesus Christ to listen to what Jesus is talking in the house meeting are we okay let's look at Marta where she is verse 40 do you know where I got this I just got it few minutes ago in the office because your boss talked to me and I have to tell you whoever have a tendency to miss church to miss house meeting to do everything that you can to keep you away at the very last minute you will pick up something that will move you away from the church or away from a meeting or away for something that is spiritual you need to listen to this he says but Marta was Gilbert do you know what kilbert means do you know what he means she was distracted amen she was burdened amen Marta was cooking for Jesus do you follow me Martha if I don't get to what I want to preach no problem but I have to say what the boss is given to me MARTA was distracted not going in a nightclub she was not distracted because she went to the Ball Game because if you do that you completely backsliding amen but when Jesus was having the house meeting Marta was drawn to something else in pretense of working for Jesus Christ we talk about pretense yesterday some of you are lost because you were not there amen Marta went and did something and what she was doing she was doing it for Jesus but she was doing that at the same time that Jesus is talking do you follow me your boss just tell me something right now listen what he's saying brother I'm saying there is no way a minister can speak on the pope and you give a message because it's a disorder he said the spirit must wait until the sermon is finished then you can give the message in other word when we start preaching the word nobody should be talking in the sun booth except when it's necessary nobody should be on the hallway talking nobody should be in the in the cry room sitting and talking except you doing something like sister can you give me a diaper yes sit down and do this because the master is talking amen you can move into another position and engage into a talk and if they ask you you say no no I'm doing something like this but the talk you're doing is not according to what is happening you out of order Amen brother amen amen do you understand you will love me one day amen amen he said but Martha verse 30 was killed in other words was distracted about much water serving who was she serving the devil was she serving the people in the nightclub was she a waitress said the restaurant she was serving Jesus Christ but the Bible called that he was a distraction he's serving Jesus a destruction it is a destruction when Jesus Christ is speaking in other words when God is having a service whatever you trying to do that will keep you away from the service of God it becomes a destruction amen even though you're doing that for Jesus Christ no I went to do this no I went to visit somebody at the hospital it is good but when did you do it you did it when it's church services it's wrong do you follow me you want to visit your to your your friend wait when church is finished tell your friend I don't leave my church and meet with you at the restaurant until service is finished amen we had the family meeting that they put they put family meeting on Sunday when I have service we had two service in the old church so when I come from the first service they say family meeting I look and say okay I talk to them I say listen to me please when my time of evening service comes I will leave your meeting and I will go to church do you follow me amen family meeting started I was there no problem I'm respecting you when the time for church happen I rose up I got in my car took my wife and my children we went to church after that until today we never have any more house meeting I mean uh any more family meeting I have a question who was targeting that family meeting [Music] because if he was a good meeting we should have continued to have that every Sunday but when I stopped being there the family meeting drop you see how the devil play you see how the devil play but you would tell me no no no no it's a family meeting I have to be there I have to be there with my family you will be there they will not cancel that service all the time because they will try to keep you away from the things of God away from the things of God and you don't discern and you think you're doing service to God like Martha continue amen Marta was killed about much serving and came to him and say Lord do you not care that my sister has left me serving alone be there therefore that she may help me Jesus is preaching Mary goes and sit and listen to the sermon of Jesus Marta found out that she cannot be in the service she need to be at the fellowship hall working for the food and Marta is coming to Jesus saying can you move Mary from there I want Mary to be with me working because we are women come on we need to be in the kitchen serving which is true that's the position of a woman amen but man shall not live by water but by every water which word do you give preeminence in your life what do you value your life shows us what you value amen everybody okay amen job to verse 41 and Jesus answered and said to her Marta Marta not Marta one time in other words my sister my sister all the time am I reading a different Bible no he said Martha Marta you are careful you are concerned and trouble about water you always have something in your life matter that will prevent you to be in church your friend came late your friend came to visit you in town your friend did this we have to be this we have to be this every time Marta you always have things that will draw you away from church that will draw you away from a house meeting that will draw you away from question and answer and those things are necessary on you need to grow up spiritually and discern the devil the devil knows you better the devil will not give you beer he knows you're not going to drink the devil knows you better the devil will give you something that look very close to the truth that you find yourself in trouble one of this day Amen Let Me continue verse 42 but one thing is what how many things are needful one thing what is that one thing God and Mary has chosen the water good part serving Jesus at the kitchen versus listening to the word Jesus say the one who sit and go to the house meeting and go to church and listen to the word have chosen the good part compared to the one that went and tried to support Jesus by works maybe visit a friend in the hospital maybe help somebody who's uh sick maybe help somebody in the highway for flat tire and miss church maybe there is a birthday somewhere we need to attend the birthday to make that person feel good one thing is needful Mary has chosen the good part which shall what not be taken away from her what Mary got what somebody got yesterday you can never take it away from that person [Music] amen amen they can take your meal away but not that one and you missed it because your reason if I asked you you have legitimate tourism you would tell me no no no I did this I did this but look at what your wisdom did to you spiritually it move you away from where God is speaking amen wake up buddy Jesus is coming go to John chapter 6 and I'll go back to my sermon you had me preach another sermon responsibility pulls me to do this amen John chapter 6 verse 27. I'm not saying if you're sick you don't go to the hospital that's not what I'm saying that's childish if this is the way you think you know what I'm talking about you know your heart amen John chapter 6 verse 27 Mary was working for food she was laboring for the food to give Jesus food you there level not for the water meat which water come on Mary was laboring for the food that will perish you eat tomorrow it goes into the drought and that's it that beautiful steak it's just one day you eat and you forget about it this is what you work for when I say food you don't understand me they are things that you laboring in your life that are your personal agenda you are doing certain things to build something but it's taking you away from God you will understand me later live or not for the meat which perishes but for the meat which do what endures to water everlasting life Mary was working for that meat and Marta was working for inanimate but Jesus said do not be in the place of martyr be with Mary amen because you have chosen a good part that will never be removed which the son of man shall do what who was the son of man Jesus Christ who was sitting with Mary giving the word Jesus look what Mary chose look what Martha chose while if you ask Martha Marta can prove to you that I was cooking for Jesus Christ but Jesus said that part is not good because I am talking you should have stopped what you're doing and listen to my talk first so what's what makes you miss church watch what is making you miss something a service maybe question and answer maybe something in church watch what is making you miss those things amen evaluate that with the word of God that you want to do the friend that you went to see yesterday can you see that friend another day but you chose to kill Church to please that friend you chose on Sunday purposely to go somewhere to see somebody so you won't be in church can you reschedule that appointment or I cannot reschedule that appointment the motive of your heart God knows it amen for those who have not signed up with the link on WhatsApp please do it so we can avoid the question left and right amen remember Sister Pam in prayer she lost her nephew remember Brother Kelly's family I believe her daughter-in-law lost her father I believe everything was spoken yes brother Robert mace sorry Denise so remember her in prayer and remember brother Kelly in prayer and the next house meeting is on October the 29th everybody okay praise be to the name of God let's stand and go to our service when I do this I am free because the the burden that he put on me do you read the Bible and the Bible said the burden of the Lord upon the prophet the burden so when he put the burden I just lift it up and push it there so now I'm free it is no more on me it is on you watch what you're doing from now on give God the preeminence amen don't compromise your family time of prayer because you want to please a friend do you follow me don't let somebody smoke in your car because you want to keep them because they're very important friend that I need to have to move higher in my life do you follow me do you follow me watch the situation you put yourself in there are many options we personally choose a certain option that put us in a tax situation to mischurch you know the automatic deposit yesterday you remember right we have that we have that when somebody want to talk to you no no no no I wanted to do this and then I was I have homework what did you do in the morning you were watching YouTube you didn't want to do that homework you waited only a night to do the homework so you can prove that I did the homework that's the reason why I cannot do this all your clothing you cannot wash them throughout the week you will wait only on Sunday to do your wash day all your clothing you put that on a Sunday all your fists you put it always on Sunday so that on Sunday you have to leave service quickly because you already prepared somebody um I mean uh something at home so when you are in the service your whole mind is about when are the people are gonna come I have to receive the people at home I have to receive the people at home you yourself put it on Sunday let's go to Daniel chapter 7. some of us don't realize we're not living alone correct if I miss church probably my children won't be able to go to church so you the parent missing Church you causing the whole family to miss church and those children cannot drive car daddy being late is causing the whole family to be late because Mom is late the whole family is late and tomorrow the children don't listen wow children don't listen brother brother Miss 100 parent delinquency seven verse two if you dare you can say amen amen if you fool we can go home and then we change the title and we call this the necessary food and not necessary food and we go home amen or the two meat Daniel 7 if you dare you can say amen amen don't worry my friend I have to do this it's a medication it's an aesthetic after a while the pain of the needle that you felt is going to go away You're Gonna feel numb and it'll be okay then I will be the best dentist after I pull your tooth amen amen Daniel spoke and said I saw in my vision you took my time so give me my time Daniel spoke and say I saw in my vision by night and behold the four wings of Heaven strove upon the great sea for those that were yesterday you remember what they see me now and the four beasts and the and four great beasts came out from the sea diverse or different one from another I'm gonna suck on the first one for now the first was like a lion you might be seated and head ego wings I beheld till the wings thereof were plucked and he was lift up from the Earth and made stand upon the feet as a man and immense heart was given to him again I'm going to refresh this at the beginning this Spirit was not in a human being it was just a spirit on the kingdom that was moving amen but after a while that spirit will receive will have a human being that is available from a spirit in the land that spirit will have a human being available to learn or to give their heart Amen to that spirit amen but before that happened the wings of the ego must be plugged off hey everybody okay in other words the wings of the ego block incarnation the wings of ego blocks incarnation amen as long as the wings are there there is no way that Spirit can move from a spirit and enter a human being you have to take the wings out when you take the wings out then that spirit will enter somebody and that person become talking it's the Devil Himself everybody okay let's go to Daniel 12. glory to God will be okay I'll be okay a preacher that flooded people that's bad I don't want you on your deathbed calling me you deceiver you don't call me Deceiver when you talk when you're about to die you will turn around you say Pastor I can see Angel I can see Angel I can see somebody I saw somebody that passed away I saw brother Branham come on amen amen amen by not pleasing you now and you call me deceiver like that woman no it won't happen Daniel chapter 12 verse 8. and I heard but I understood not then say that I oh my Lord what shall the end of these things of these things and he say go your way Daniel for the words are closed up and sealed they are kept secret until the time of the end many shall be purified and made white and tried with this word amen but the wicked shall do wickedly and none of the wicked shall understand only the wise virgin will understand and what made you wise is the second novel only those that have that second anointing will understand we'll understand what the word that has been sealed in the book everybody okay let's go to revelation 17. only the wise will understand glory to God Revelation 17 verse 12. if you dare you can say Amen the Bible says and the ten horn you know what he means right which you sow are Ten Kings so this Beast that have seven horns are seven heads and ten horns it's a beast and the Beast have seven heads and he have ten horns amen if you remember those horns had crowns you remember you don't take a crown and put on the horn it's telling you that horn is not really a horn it's a symbol because you Crown the people you're crying the king you're crying a human being brother Brian I'm saying you don't cry in the spirit you have to Crown a human being so when they say ten horns with crowns they're already telling you that that horn is a human being did I lose somebody so these that's why the Bible say they are Ten Kings everybody okay they are Ten Kings glory to God I'm on the military airplane this thing is deadly but we're not going to crush that's clear that's guaranteed and there is no crashing everybody okay but just keep your helmet because the where we go in there you need to be able to breathe good amen glory to God amen I'm in 10 I mean uh 12. the 10 horns which you saw are 10 Kings which receive no Kingdom as yet amen but receive power as king nobody gave them the kingdom amen but they already have power so they are operating with a power that is not a king power can I repeat it again do you want me to repeat do you want me to repeat let's read it together there are Ten Kings which receive no Kingdom as yet so they don't have Kingdom as yet nobody crammed them yet everybody okay but they are operating with a power if you're not crown and you are operating as a king who are you who are you where you chosen were you elected no so how did you get in the power for you to be elected you must go through election when they go to election you win the election then they bring a Quran they say this is the pastor everybody okay and then they put a crown on you but if the dev had done an election and you begin to Reign like you the pastor of the church it's a coup d'etat it's a dictator it's a dictator he took the power in a different way but he didn't take it by election no maybe he slayed the king for him to take his place maybe he deceived the Army and went an attack and took the power because he didn't get the power yet are we okay we okay so these Ten Kings have something to do with dictator because they are operating they're not crown amen but they're already ruling like kings glory to God Amen back there verse 12 and the ten horns which you sow are Ten Kings which receive no Kingdom as yet but receive power as as king how many hour with who so these King will first work with the Beast are you okay amen at the beginning of the Reign there will be associated there will be associated with the Beast amen so when they are killing it is not really them killing there is a beast behind that is using them to kill we okay job to verse uh 13. these have what they don't have two minds in other words all of them think the same way right amen all of them have the same concept they have the same mentality if you talk to the first king the second King the third King they belong to one group they belong to one group they speak one mind they have one mind not two mind one amen they have one group in other words you can identify them by their mind do you follow me if you talk to one you talk to the other they believe the same thing in other words if one is against brother Greg if you go talk to the other one he's against brother grade you talk to the third one he's against whether so you can identify them their group by what they believe everybody okay now amen okay job to verse 13. they these have one mind and shall give their power and strength to who so there is a covenant between them and the Beast that's why they have an association there is a covenant where we're going is very deep verse 14 these shall make war with dilemma and the lamb shall overcome them for he is Lord of lords and King of Kings Revelation 19 and they that are with him who are with the lamb being a battle you remember now they that are with him are called water what does the man do to a wife he picked a wife he chose the wife that's why those that are follow him our father have fine Lenin which is the brother remember the marriage of dilemma have come and the blood have made herself ready she was away in fine learning which are which is the righteousness of the what because they are chosen so they're not making War only toward God they hate you too they don't like you they don't like you and they don't like your husband they don't like your family everybody okay so these shall make war with the lamb and the lamb shall overcome them for he is Lord of Lord and king of kings and they that are with him are called chosen and faithful it's a faithful woman you there verse 15 and he said to me the water which you saw remember yesterday you remember yesterday where the horse sits our people and multitude and nation and water watch now verse 16. and they turned on which you saw upon the Beast these shall Hit The Horde so at the beginning they are friend something will happen with the whole with the horn that they would turn around and begin to hit The Horde in other words the Covenant will be broken are we okay so the reason that's how you read the prophecy so and there will come a time when the Covenant is going to be broken amen and hatred will begin to come amen you will wonder why so and so was friend to so and so but now they are they hurt each other so much they were bodies now they don't talk no more and one is even at the point that if we get an occasion he will kill the other one because the Covenant was broken everybody okay amen glory to God verse 16. and the tenthorn which you saw upon the Beast these shall head the whole and shall make her desolate in water thank you naked and shall eat her flesh what a hatred amen and duarta [Music] so these 10 horns will break their Covenant head the and burn her anybody care so what the Beast is carrying he's carrying his own Autodesk Auto destruction do you follow me God took the Beast and opened the software of the Beast do you follow me and put something that would destroy the Beast and kept it and let the Beast go at the beginning that device will help the Beast until a certain time God

us be the beginning and the ending Lord of this service in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen God richly bless you my subject this morning I'm going to remind you this quickly brother Branham says scripture doesn't play with words whatever is in the record is there for the anointed eyes to see I'm repeating this for some reason until it's soaked it will help you the rest of your life brother it's there for a purpose my subject this morning is the four phases of roof the form of Babylon and the Bear the fall of Babylon and the Bear we are still on the threshing floor dealing with the second Oiler and according to our Tabernacle we are very very very deep into the holiest amen you know how to get into into the Tabernacle you can go yourself and check your life and correct what need to be corrected everybody okay in the Book of Daniel that we are dealing with brother Branham says this he says sister Simpson told me this afternoon she said brother Branham I read the entire Book of Daniel like brother Stephen asked us to do everybody okay I just don't know no more when I stop go through then I did when I started how many feel like that how many read the scripture we gave you glory to God if you didn't really be my guest here it is Sister Simpson if you are here tonight I believe I see her sitting over there I never say nothing in the trailer I held my peace because I thought maybe I'll get to it but the vision that Daniel had so down there by the river was sealed up Hallelujah man until the end timer anybody okay another word you can read it but you will not understand it [Music] amen that's why Daniel himself said what is the meaning of this they say no it doesn't belong to you if we tell you you're gonna put it in the book and the Antichrist will escape everybody okay the end time message shall reveal it the last Church age Glory whoa there you are Oh my he sets me to think of it the water the Water mystery the mystery shakes brother Branham you hate the mystery if you check brother Brandon he shakes me too amen the things that the church WIll bat their eyes and say it is water because they keep reading they don't understand let me put it home because it's very easy for you to look at the Pentecostal the Methodist and the Baptist let me put it home even the people in the message [Applause] do we need to know these things to have eternal life do I need to know the seals to be saved alone yes you do did you hear that before without the second oil you're not gonna enter the mystery of who Jesus Christ was not a third person not the second person not the third person but the person of God in other words enter Trinity remember the Trinity of the devil everybody okay all these are the mysteries of God will be revealed because it's wrought here in this book and be revealed to the end time water generation so if this book need to be revealed in the end time we must know what is going on in Daniel do I need it and at this last days is when God is going to reveal this secret to the church he has not done it before and the reason he has not done it is to keep the church are watching and praying all the time not knowing when he was coming but remember in Daniel 12 he says the wise shall understand in the last day so the wise are gonna be in the last day what made them wise because of the second oil is activated in other words throughout the edges that oil was never available in other words throughout the ages that anointing was never available because if that anointing was given to power power would have opened the seals and if Paul opened the sealed Jesus Christ must come but if Jesus Christ come in the edge of power you're going to be left Jesus cannot come without you being on the board you must have your ticket confirm it and go to the airport and get all your luggages you get inside then Jesus take off glory to God the spirit of wisdom that makes people wise comes into the church to make known to the church by the revelation of the Holy Ghost bringing the church in and revealing what day that they are living in we are living in just the same as Gabriel came to Daniel the Holy Spirit come to the church in the last day to reveal these things this water is your microphone working try it hello okay I need some volume okay to reveal this great water deep water Secret is your microphone working can you give him some volume try it hello praise God to reveal this great water the Deep secret things everybody okay so the oil of wisdom will be unfolded in the last day when it's unfolded it is coming to unfold the revelation of the deep face and by the difference then you're saying we will be purified we will be made white the mystery when you really catch them everybody okay the Mysteries have the power to release devil from your life [Music] everybody here when a mystery come to you it doesn't say in Jesus name go away go away that's not the way a mystery operates anybody care when a mystery come in your life and you catch the Mysteries that mystery will catch you up with Jesus Christ the mystery gives you power to become what Jesus wants you to be everybody okay as you get that power the devil that was holding you will feel that something enter you do you follow me yes you follow me let me give you an example if you take a glass that is metallic metal anybody okay everybody okay and there is maybe uh maybe a bag holding into that glass over there if you take electrical power you put in the glass what happened to the bag the bag had two options the more he stayed to that cup he's gonna die all the bag have to take off amen you didn't do anything to the bag you just wire the current and it takes care of it amen when the devil is on your life amen just receive the word you follow me when you receive the word once the word enter you and say Amen when you leave from here you are thinking about it everybody okay everybody okay when you're driving your car you're thinking about it when you walk up in the morning you're thinking about it when you're working you're thinking about it you will find out how many Devils themselves are living your life without you saying anything everybody okay that's the power of a mystery it will purify your life God will be so real to you until you look at the things of God you say my God how was I reading the Bible and I never seen something like this now understand who I am now understand this understand this I understand this where else can we go because we found out that you have the word of what eternalize everybody clear so far glory to God as we look at this image of Daniel we divided this image into five and we are dealing with the last one which is Rome and we found out that Rome have two stages he moved from the Pagan empire into a purple Empire amen and in the Beast it was interpreted as the Beast that was wounded but the wound was not here everybody okay now if you notice you are here somewhere around here this is where your church age is started everybody okay everybody okay Rome started in 68 before Christ and once destroyed a 476. 80 s after crust anybody okay the churches started at 53. Amen in other words the true changes started when Rome was still pagan are we okay are we okay are we okay and the church changes continue to move amen the first churches went the second went the third was peregamus amen started from 312 into six or six amen this is where 476 feet Amen in other words from the time of power all the way to the edge of pilgrimus the church was operating with Pagan room somebody pigeon Rome is the one who killed Jesus Christ Jesus was not killed by the Pope Jesus was killed by the Roman amen Paul was destroyed in Rome Paul was not killed by the Pope everybody okay so far do you follow me do you follow me so the churches started here all the way there then when the Empire of Rome was destroyed Rome changed from and get into pepperon what are you trying to say brother Stephen this right here is pure iron it started as a kingdom he started as a kingdom when he got to somewhere toward the end of it the church age is kicking and the church edges went with the groom until Rome was destroyed and when Rome flipped the church edges continue do you follow me if we can see the church edges in connection to the image of Daniel too we must also see the church ages in connection to the Beast because those two goes together Daniel 2 is the physical Daniel 7 is the spirit behind the kingdom everybody okay glory to God now we got the Beast and the two changes amen when we speak about the church ages we are talking about a dispensation that God is trying to take a breath out of the Gentile amen because Jesus came to the Jews and the Jews rejected Jesus Christ and Jesus Christ turned around to take a breath from the Gentile and at the cross we found what happened to Jesus that Jesus was pierced like Adam and out of Jesus Christ came water came blood and the spirit which was showing that the bread was coming out of Jesus Christ everybody okay and Paul as a messenger of the age pick up the Revelation and say wait a minute the bread is born everybody here but if the bread is born I'm afraid how was the bloodborne Paul look he said oh my God that preached Jesus At The Cross but this is what happened to Adam in the Garden of Eden so somewhere there must be a serpent I am jealous over you with Godly jealousy for I have expressed you to one husband that I may present you as a chest virgin too but I feel less by any mean as the serpent began if through his water and we found out that the serpent was a beast amen he was not a snake but that Beast was destroyed and made into a reptile amen so he's no longer a beast he's a reptile amen but Paul is afraid of the serpent amen but we found out now that when John unfolded the serpent John says that that oh serpent amen really he's the Dragon you remember Revelation 12 verse 9 what are you trying to say brother Stephen as we start from heaven in Revelation 12 we found out that in heaven something appeared there was a great red dragon having seven heads and water so this dragon in heaven had seven heads and he had ten horns everybody okay and the Bible says the seventh crime was put upon his head and he still the tale of this Dragon drew the third part of the star of heaven and did cast down amen catch them down into the Earth this Dragon follow me carefully not only did he have seven heads and ten horn but this Dragon took the stars of God and dumped them into the Dust keep that in mind I'm not gonna touch the woman that will come down the road amen and the dragon stood before the woman we would see that woman later on which is ready to be delivered for to devour her child as soon as he was born we will see that down the road and the Great Dragon was Caster the water everybody okay so the Beast now in the end time is a dragon but the dragon is in heaven what is in the on the Earth brother Stephen he says in Revelation 13 John Abyss rise up out of the sea we talked about it yesterday having how many horns seven horns and water and ten horns everybody okay so In Heaven There was a beast with seven heads and ten horn on the earth there must be something that's gonna match that Beast in heaven we have God and Lucifer you remember president and vice president on the earth you have Adam and you have the serpent amen God went to Adam and Lucifer went to who because this is a president to president vice president to vice president they marched together are we okay now so in heaven the dragon have seven hands and ten horns so something must be on the earth that's gonna match that dragon and we find that a beast is on the earth and that Beast also have seven heads so when the dragon comes he looks he found something that looked like him everybody okay and the dragon the Beast and the Beast that came out which you saw was like unto a water let me stop here when the kingdom of the Gentiles started in Daniel 7 he started with a lion right then he moved all the way down into a bear after the bear like David showed to us he moved into a leper everybody okay and from a leopard he went to a mixing of all three amen a mixing of all three which is wrong everybody okay if you look from here the succession is going down do you follow me it is going from Babylon two middle passion two Greek to roam but if you look in Revelation 13 scripture don't pray with words you okay the Bible started with leopard everybody okay and the feet of the water damn so now it looks like we're going back you follow me and after the bear was fellow the lion so we were running away from Babylon you following me the lion was Babylon everybody okay Babylon was destroying we run away from Babylon but through this Beast we are rebuilding back again through Babylon we are going back again toward Babylon back again that's why in Revelation 17 that woman is called mystery Babylon the great because Babylon is rebuilt back again are we okay and what happened to this Beast that is rebuilding Babylon the Bible says that the dragon gave him his water and his water and his water [Music] the another word the dragon take everything that he has and poor in this Beast this Beast received the Incarnation of the Demonic anointing straight into him everybody okay everybody okay and the Bible says that the dragon gave him his seat yes if I want to explain that to you in a simple way the dragon have a throne let's make it simple and the Dragon Rise From the throne and say you best come and sit down here in other words the reign of the devil that was in heaven he's winning and ruling every Kingdom by that Beast everybody okay now in pergamas the Bible says this I know that works and word that dwells even well what now according to the Beast the Beast receive a seat where is that seat we don't know but when we look at the church edges and blending the church edges and the beasts remember that I'm blending the church edges and the Beast when we go through the church ages we found out that certain seed is in pergamers you remember that last Sunday so now when we come back to our uh our chart here we found out that here in perganus was the seat of Satan amen and the dragon gave this Beast here his seat in other words the Incarnation of the Demonic power of Satan upon this Beast here happen in the age of pergamas did I lose you this is why the Bible says this that I saw one of his head as he were wounded to death and his deadly wound was water and all the world will begin to water now stop this seen here of the Incarnation happened in 325. you remember that again in the Nazi Council but the beasts the kingdom of Rome was destroyed in 476. do you follow me in other word the devil Escape Rome before the destruction of Rome 4656 comes after this amen Satan will ride with you do you follow me do you follow me Satan will ride with you Satan will take you to go and rob a bank as you wrapping the bank Satan is with you do you follow me as you picking up the money you put on your pocket Satan is with you do you follow me when you get in your car and you run away from the bank Satan is with you everybody okay when they call the police do you follow me do you follow me Satan will leave you [Applause] you follow me and he ran away from you and you're the one that go to jail Satan is never in the jail do you follow me the jail of Satan will be when we on the Thousand Year that's where they're going to put them in jail amen amen Satan will take you to the hotel Satan will give you money to buy birth control stuff so that woman doesn't get pregnant but here he will go with you until you commit fornication until you commit everything until you commit adultery when you finish your adultery this is when Satan leaves you everybody okay Satan use the beast in the Garden of Eden he used this Serpent and the serpent was anointed and the serpent was talking to evil if you don't know this you don't know this you don't know this you don't know this everything was good yes when the voice of God begin to come do you know what Satan did he he told the Beast he said open open open now baby said where are you going he said open snake serpent open say what is going on he said open now I will talk to you when I'm outside when the serpent opened when the devil come outside he said you know what snake bye-bye we see you down the road and when God came if you notice God never talk to the servant God's to his children he spoke to Adam he asked what was going on he spoke to Eve but when he turned to the serpent God never asked a question he just took judgment and destroyed it completely and the snake the serpent that was a big fellow above everybody now he's a snake now the elephant can come and say that's how the devil play with you everybody here so when the devil saw that the destruction of the Empire is coming out you following me the devil escaped the Empire anybody here and let Rome to be destroyed but he came out and he moved into a pepper everybody okay that event that he escaped before his destruction that event completed your first seal [Music] everybody okay Daniel into the Beast the Beast into the church ages and the church edges into the Seals Everything combined together [Music] everybody okay now glory to God Amen in three right here in 3 25 we know that the spirit that was in Judah came out because Judah hang himself and he released his Spirit Jesus also released his Spirit on the day of Pentecost the spirit of Jesus came down and the spirit of Judah also came down but that Spirit was looking for somebody to enter in just like he entered Judah everybody okay and that happened in 325 where a crown was given to that spirit amen now that spirit is no longer a spirit it is now a human being glory to God the Bible says in Revelation 13 it's a military airplane you need to stay alerted here is water wisdom only the wise will understand the oil of wisdom the second oil here is the wisdom let him die his water understand remember wisdom and understanding in the Book of Proverbs they together now let him that has understanding count the number of the water for it is the number of water so the Beast is a man now we okay and his number is water 666. how many six do we have which is a trinity of six because his power always worked in Trinity everybody okay brother Branham say but when this awful deceiving Spirit oh man incarnated incarnate spirit this Doctrine Spirit became incarnated to take the place of Christ into Earth it must be worshiped turn to be a worship like Christ in other word over a dead Vatican I have been right there it is wrote vicarious Philly day V everybody okay in the Roman numeral is that the file it's number five you know that how many feet do we have we have two five times two equal ten everybody okay letter I in Roman each one how many eyes do we have no continue counting five how many do we have how many one times six is what now see in the Roman numeral it's 100. everybody okay l in the Roman numeral is 50. and D in the Roman numeral is what now let's do the math 500 Plus 50 is what 550 plus 100 650 plus six plus ten it's a man this is what is written on the Pope continue and it's wrought in Roman numeral you just joined line at the bottom of those Roman numerals it means instead of the son of God in other words he is the vicar you know what is a whatever is just take the place of something he is the Vaca he is in the state of the Son of God a demon calling himself Jesus Christ everybody okay so far now when this connected into a man why did the Incarnation happen remember the Incarnation cannot happen as long as the wings of an eagle are there everybody okay glory to God Paul says that I know that I that after my departing not when I'm because Paul was a prophet everybody okay after I am proud of I am killed by Rome everybody okay shall grieve his wolf enter in among you not sparing the water the flock and Paul said that the mystery of iniquity do already work he already saw it but he knows that he cannot do anything I'm long as I'm there amen only he who now let us will let until he became uh he he be taken out of the way and then shall that we can be revealed whom the Lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth you know what he means and shall destroy with the brightness of his water so this Incarnation could never happen until Paul is taken off where are you going my friend I'm saying what there help was there a prophecy concerning that you remember Paul prophecy last night and not that after my departure Grievous wolf shall enter in among you and man of your own class rather in your own church damn water Catholic Church saw that will raise up among you and pull away the disciple after them and Paul's wolf we found out became the worker the nicolete and that started up there everybody okay glory to God where are you taking me amen now when that Spirit enter man what happened to the church brother Branham said natural he fell in Eden by listening to certain reasoning against God's word that is how she fell all right sir she fell because she did that spiritual Eve which is the church now now that is the church Chris Brown She also fell how did she fell the game that they were playing opened the door for Satan to enter a human being hey everybody okay nothing either now but in Rome at the nursing Council when she rejected that Pentecostal church that went down to Nazi and listening to Roman reasoning instead of holding on to the word of God she fell and everything away from her died with her around water so the church the brother started like he fell how did she fail because the beasts have entered into somebody just like he did in the Garden of Eden anybody okay what happened now in the Church of tatarian a woman rose up who is Jezebel amen because the Beast now have sexual Affair spiritually with the church and the church became an immoral woman which is called Jezebel that is teaching people just like evils teaching Adam how to commit adultery or fornication everybody okay so far where are we going with this my friend glory to God the Bible says in Revelation 17 verse 3 that so he carried me away in the spirit Into the Wilderness and saw a woman sitting upon a scarlet color Beast full of the name of blasphemy having seven horns and water and horns so we found out now that this dragon is in the Beast this Beast is now having a wife and the Beast and the wives are blending together amen just like the Beast and Eve Blended together we okay something happened when they Blended together can I erase some of them let me go here everybody okay yeah glory to God now we got the best and the woman what happened next follow me carefully the Bible says that when John saw the woman she was drunken with the blood of the saint amen she didn't drink the blood she drunk so much until she became drunk because for you to become drunk you must drink beyond your limit amen amen everybody okay you cannot take one one glass and you get drunk no you have to drink drink drink until it's beyond your limit so this woman killed killed killed until she kills so much and she become drunk drunk of what of the blood of your brothers and sisters she was drunken with the blood of the scent and with the blood of the Martyr of who Jesus so this will happen after the coming of Jesus Christ because the more they believe in Jesus Christ so it's not in the Old Testament it is in the New Testament everybody okay it is the Church of God the Bible continue he say but John said I saw her and I wonder with great water how can something so beautiful but it's so bloody what is happening with this woman I'm going slowly Revelation 18 verse 24 the Bible said in her in that woman was found the blood of the water prophet and Waters and of all that was slain upon the Earth it's a killer she looks beautiful on the outside but she will kill you Revelation 19 2 for true and righteous are his judgment the Judgment of God for he has judged the water that woman right there which did corrupt the Earth with her fornication she's teaching people and his Avenge the blood of his servant at water so God is seeking for a Revenge amen the reason why God want to destroy and burn this Beast here because the Beast has killed so many of God children everybody okay and the Beast is drunken with the blood of descent everybody okay where are you going in proverb 9 verse 17 if you remember that woman said stolen water sweet Brad dating in secret is water but he knoweth not that they're dead that day and that her guests are water she's a piece of Hell herself killing people everybody good so far where are you going my brother now we found out that this woman is now responsible for the killing of the saint of God amen the combination of this woman and the Beast is bloody everybody okay when you take the Beast and you match him with this human with this woman this woman has become a killer in the same language what is happening is when the Beast matches with a church he opened the second seal I'm letting that sink in the festival is completed everybody okay we're blending John Daniel the seals the seven churches together everybody okay everybody okay why is he blending the seventh seal the the second film listen to this the Bible says this that when this Beast Rose and was healed he was given unto him to make war with the what you see now everybody here and to the water that's why the disciple couldn't do nothing to Rome they have to be taken to the stack and they burn them they put them in the lion they kill them because the power was given to this Beast to destroy descent and power was given him of the all Kindred and tongue and water so anybody that this beasts want to kill he will kill him and all that dwell upon the Earth shall worship Him whose name are not written in the books of lamb of uh in the Book of Life of the lamb slain before the foundation of the world if any man has a near let him water he that leadeth into captivity shall go into captivity he that killeth with water must be water why is God saying somebody is killing with the sword here because in the second seal when it was open the Bible says when they opened the seconds here I heard the second beast say come and see and then went out another horse that was what the color of the Dragon was what red are we blending together are we blaming together I'm going slowly until you will see your enemy if you're sleeping that's your problem everybody okay and then and then power was given to him that sat there on to take peace from the Earth and that he should kill one another and they was giving him a water that's why the woman is a killer everybody okay brother Branham says this glory to God he says I am coding from the materology from the time of Saint Augustine of Hippo until 1586 on the Roman meteorology the Roman Catholic Church put how many 681 million your brothers and sisters were killed how many was she drunk everybody okay was he so dread was he riding your head I I mean a red horse what was it the same power the same rather there is your seal they admit 68 million this is what the Catholic Church admitted but it was more than that brother Branham say on the martyrology beside all those put to death outside of that oh mercy during the Dark Ages there were a million fat to lion and slaughtering every way because they would not bow down to water foreign you see the Catholic Church killing you don't understand because those Mysteries were still until the end time why do we need to know this everybody okay now we have seen that that Beast goes to peregamus pick up a woman in tatarian and when he joined with the woman he kills this hand and he's and and and he's completely drunk with the blood of the sin amen he kills so much ah until the age of tartarian was almost gone do you follow me God open up something for some reason Christopher Columbus discover America I'm going slowly Shake somebody's hand and say Shake Yourself I don't know where you were you last night can I continue amen when Christopher Columbus discovered America he was right when the when the woman is completely destroying almost all the Christian God opened up something they sent Christopher Columbus he went he discovered the United States when he discovered the United States in the age of Sardis they may flower pick up the passenger and they left England if you need Court you see me I am loaded there everybody okay and they move into America and for the first time America become inhabited that was in the age of Sardis everybody okay in the age of Philadelphia in 191776 the United States of America receive its independence everybody okay then another Beast came out everybody okay why was America discovered brother Branham from the persecution of the church and all through those Dark Ages the people come over here what is America America was established a plum of Rock with the Mayflower for one purpose for water because the Beast is killing them in Europe they run away completely to a new continent where there is nobody so that they can worship God in their freedom foreign but when they are establishing their Kingdom they begin to use number 13. we okay we okay and then is that the Bible say she fled from the dragon and had the place prepared everybody okay are we okay are we okay brother Branham say so is this great nation of ours we come here and on Prime of Rock this nation was funded on freedom of religion because our forefather had fled water of the modern water Jezebel's sister and had come up and stood many great persecution and martyrdom under the fourth system of water this is where your Thanksgiving came up so if you want to worship God you go to America you want to worship God you go to America America begin to grow as a big Power when it started it started like a dragon like a lamb when they have the Constitution they leave one chair for God when they make their money in God we trust when they are sowing to be president they put their hand in the Bible everything is Godly Nation [Applause] everybody okay everybody okay to God Amen what happened this Beast of America the Bible say another Beast came out asked the if and he had two horns like you want to but he's pickled around like a dragon what happened my friend what happened my friend what happened my friend we know that the dragon was in heaven amen and the dragon incarnated into a beast with seven heads and ten horns and that Beast got a wife which was Jezebel which was drunk by the blood of descent we call her mystery Babylon they're great everybody okay now the protested flee away from Europe they established themselves and when they establish 13 colonies Flag 13 13 a number of water [Music] everybody okay everybody okay everybody okay the one that is killing is not the Beast really it is the woman that is destroying do you follow me remember brother Branham said the greatest bait the devil have is a woman any moral woman do you remember do you remember so when Rome saw that Roman look and say I'm gonna send this woman to chase those people up there everybody okay everybody okay the Bible says this because later on the beasts begin to speak like a water so somehow the Dragon Enter America everybody okay but we know that the dragon was in the Beast of Rome amen and the Beast of Rome was working with a woman but we found that the Buffalo now when he talked he's talking like a dragon when the serpent talk he talked like Lucifer who was in The Serpent when the Beast the Buffalo began to talk he talked like a dragon in other words something happened when the American people were getting happy dancing the Dragon Enter in America and then sat alone to be there everybody okay the Bible says this let me go and he the Beast exercise water all the power of water remember the first Beast the devil gave him his authority his power and his secret if his exercise in the power of the first Beast the power of the first priest came from Lucifer so America at a certain age will act for Lucifer I'll let you soak that in with your Patriot I'll let you suck that in I'm a Democrat I'm a republican I let you soak that in you will be that's why you heard brother Branham say everybody working in the government that is not born again you remember the court is working for who why is brother Brian I'm saying that why because the power that is working there is a power that is coming from Satan I'm going slowly and you're going to understand the world can I continue glory to God and the Bible says that he should make an image to the Beast which had a wound by sword and did live so this Beast not only is he speaking like a dragon but he makes something an image is something that look like something he looked at Rome Rome that he fled away now he take Rome and reproduce Rome again everybody okay and had power to give life up to the image of the Beast that the image of the beach should buff Waters and cause as many as would not worship the same thing they had in Europe the image of the Beast should be water so America now is also a killer [Music] don't say Amen it's okay everybody okay everybody okay I am speaking the Bible what is going on so some reason the dragon came in this beast and this Beast combined with a woman but we found out that later on the Buffalo also spoke like a dragon so for some reason there is a connection between this woman and the buffalo amen thank God for Malachi 4. [Applause] thank God for this message because when this begin to happen God said brother Branham but here when brother Branham came brother Branham took his binoculars and he put it like this when

through the tribulation Heavenly Father God we are approaching you again humbly this morning father thanking you for your grace thanking you for your love thanking you for your mercy father we could be just as bright as anybody looking at the things that are happening in this world and saying that oh he always happened like this it will get better and that's what they will try to do to make things better but the scriptures say when everybody will say peace then sudden destruction will come [Music] but Lord you are opening everything every cannon that you can [Music] showing that modern event are made clear by prophecy we can now see what is happening though we cannot see that naturally but we can sense a pressure coming up that is telling us that we must be ready because at any time when you step in you will be able to meet you into the air father may you remove every Spirit of preachers may you remove every spirit of destruction every spirit that is showing people away like Marta [Music] caught up into this and that and neglecting the very good part that cannot be taken away from us Lord may you break that intellectual spirit that Spirit of stubbornness that Spirit of reasoning that Spirit of proud that is fighting against the ministry and do not want to Humble themselves not to Humble before me but to Humble before the word before the message that is preached so that people can take their life in seriously and check the life and correct what needs to be corrected and leave circumspectingly knowing that any time the role can be calling Young father may you continue to unfold more than what we have done this morning Lord time run out of me but Lord you are the Holy Spirit you are the inside teacher the one that can continue to instruct your children and father are not some are not here and probably they won't even care to listen to what was preached because they are so busy doing other things but may you be merciful to them that somehow you can shake them to wake them upload because we don't want anybody perish we don't want anybody left to be honest we don't want to leave any hoof we all want to go further into this Rapture into this Third Exodus that you have brought to us Lord father you have given us a precious message that is showing up the way in the midst of Darkness may we check our priority may we check our motive may we check our of the objective may we check our hidden agenda what are we trying to accomplish for what purpose may you help this church may you comfort the family brother Kyle may you comfort sister Pam and the family may you help the funeral May you touch those that are sick Lord and Afflicted may you heal them may you deliver the oppressed if anybody has a need Lord father may you granted unto them because
