[7:17] protect us as you did with your children
[7:19] of israel lord

[7:55] have need of to go through the trial
[7:57] lord to keep the faith lord to to hold
[8:00] the standard despite whatever the enemy

[8:09] we feel like we're drowning or a fire we
[8:11] feel like we're getting burnt lord but

[27:26] uh this song came in my heart this week
[27:28] as we've been looking at
[27:31] everything a lot has been unfolding
[27:34] and as brother stephen was saying that
[27:36] um
[27:37] he's going to shake the boat
[27:39] but it's really not bruh stephen shaking
[27:41] is the lord is doing the shaking you
[27:43] know
[27:45] yes we are
[27:46] listening to brother chad
[27:48] some time ago talking about
[27:50] the
[27:51] headstone
[27:53] those who fall on the stone will be
[27:55] broken
[27:56] but if it falls on you it grants you the
[27:58] powder
[27:59] so it's better to fall on the stone let
[28:01] it break you
[28:03] that is what's supposed to happen
[28:05] if you push and you have your way and
[28:07] let it fall on you
[28:09] not good
[28:11] amen praise the lord
[28:13] amen this song is about that that um
[28:17] image that daniel saw that
[28:19] nebuchadnezzar saw actually
[28:21] coming all the way down from the head
[28:23] to the ten toes
[28:25] to the time we are living in
[28:27] and as
[28:28] the prophet said the ten toes was
[28:31] represented after the second world war
[28:34] so we know that is our time
[28:36] and a stone was cut out of the mountains
[28:38] without hands
[28:40] the trusted zombie a blessing to you
[28:46] yet once more lord
[28:51] shake not just heaven but earth
[28:55] and many stars
[28:58] are being moved out of place
[29:04] but there are some who stood with ladies
[29:08] and orion
[29:12] in every age
[29:16] who kept their first estate
[29:21] and though the powers
[29:24] of heaven are shaken
[29:29] we've received a kingdom
[29:33] that cannot be moved
[29:38] or that can be shaken
[29:42] will
[29:43] be shaken
[29:47] let thy word lord
[29:51] shake us into place
[29:56] [Music]
[29:58] the heavens declare
[30:01] the glory of god
[30:06] [Music]
[30:17] night on tonight
[30:19] it showed
[30:21] knowledge
[30:25] for they are all
[30:28] in god's perfect peace
[30:33] oh
[30:34] but tell me what will happen
[30:38] if the moon should leave her place
[30:43] then the face of the earth would be
[30:47] a dark and chaos again
[30:53] so what about the earthly hosts who were
[30:57] made in the image of god
[31:02] if we are not in order how can we do the
[31:07] works of god
[31:09] [Music]
[31:12] yet once more lord
[31:16] shake not just heaven but earth
[31:21] and many
[31:22] stars are being moved out of place
[31:28] [Music]
[31:30] but there are some who stirred
[31:33] but ladies and gents
[31:37] [Music]
[31:39] in every age
[31:43] kept their first
[31:45] day
[31:48] [Music]
[31:50] the world is again
[31:52] [Music]
[31:54] falling apart
[32:00] and soon the millennium
[32:03] will be our shedding
[32:09] but this kingdom
[32:12] will be in you spiritually
[32:18] before it comes in the earth
[32:21] literally
[32:26] for in the days of the tentos
[32:30] came a rock struck without hands
[32:36] despite every image in our earth
[32:40] made by man
[32:44] oh
[32:46] i know you're not the kingdom
[32:49] of the lord is in you
[32:55] for the stone did not only smite but
[32:59] grew into a mountain too
[33:05] yet once more
[33:08] lord shake not just heaven but earth
[33:14] and every star
[33:16] you're being moved out of place
[33:23] but there are some who stayed with
[33:26] ladies and gents
[33:32] in every age
[33:35] we kept our first estate
[33:38] [Music]
[33:41] we were like dry bones
[33:44] down in the
[33:46] valley
[33:50] then the son of man came
[33:53] with a prophecy
[33:59] and out of his mouth
[34:01] came seven
[34:03] thundering voices
[34:08] that quickened to bring to life
[34:11] this scattered body
[34:17] demon noise and the shaking
[34:20] as his bone came to his bone
[34:25] sinew and flesh skin came upon it but it
[34:30] had no life of its own
[34:35] but then he prophesied again
[34:38] the dynamics came into that body
[34:44] and so
[34:45] tonight we can stand a mighty marching
[34:50] on me
[34:52] [Music]
[34:54] yet once more lord
[34:56] oh
[34:58] shake not just heaven
[35:01] earth
[35:02] and many
[35:04] stars are being moved out of place
[35:11] but we are those who
[35:14] stood with ladies and orion
[35:21] in this last age
[35:24] we've kept our first estate
[35:30] and though the power
[35:33] of heaven are shaking
[35:38] we've received a kingdom
[35:42] that cannot be moved
[35:47] all that can be shaken
[35:51] will
[35:52] be shaken
[35:56] but let thy word lord
[36:00] shake us into place
[36:04] [Music]
[36:06] let thy word lord
[36:09] shake us into place
[36:15] let thy word lord
[36:18] shake us into place
[36:21] [Music]
[36:28] amen
[36:31] i want to be shaken the place where god
[36:34] wants me to be
[36:45] amazing grace
[36:49] shall
[36:51] always be my
[36:54] song a praise
[36:59] for
[37:00] it was grace
[37:03] [Music]
[37:14] [Music]
[37:16] i
[37:17] do
[37:18] not
[37:19] know
[37:22] [Music]

[43:02] because on sunday you're going to see
[43:04] summer
[43:05] what calvary have done for you
[43:08] amen
[43:09] how many caught were we going amen how
[43:12] many understand the direction
[43:14] few people
[43:16] a few people
[43:19] you might be seated
[43:20] i need to get a
[43:22] ten minute and then we move on amen
[43:25] because i don't want anybody to get lost
[43:27] because on sunday we're going to dig
[43:29] again
[43:30] amen amen
[43:33] blessed be the name of the lord amen
[43:36] hallelujah
[43:38] thank you jesus
[43:39] it's not complicated
[43:42] it's just a multi-directional
[43:44] aspect
[43:46] that brother branham took that makes it
[43:48] a little bit harder for people
[43:50] amen amen i don't want you to read the
[43:52] quote and read another quote
[43:56] and think that those two quotes are
[43:58] contradictory
[44:00] i don't want you to do that amen amen
[44:03] it's still the same
[44:04] it's just you need to read and
[44:08] study brother brown i'm pretty good
[44:10] with the eyes of the holy spirit then
[44:12] everything else will blend together amen
[44:16] this is a deep deep big subject
[44:19] and it's the hardest one
[44:21] in the message
[44:22] the holy ghost
[44:24] amen amen we preach about it people
[44:27] preach about it we spoke about it we
[44:30] went to the prayer line people fell down
[44:33] and still no holy ghost
[44:35] amen amen we need to recalibrate our
[44:38] shooting
[44:39] and see what are we missing
[44:41] then we know how we're doing amen
[44:44] hallelujah somebody's tired
[44:48] all right
[44:49] we landed with roof i'm just going to
[44:52] take 10 minutes and then we go
[44:55] roof was living in her mother's home
[44:58] i want to do this so somebody can catch
[45:00] up easily
[45:01] in her mother house
[45:04] and that was the house of idolatry
[45:08] amen her and hope orpah everybody okay
[45:11] then they move from the house by
[45:13] marriage
[45:15] and they enter into the house of naomi
[45:19] amen amen
[45:22] by entering into the house of naomi
[45:25] they entered into the camp
[45:28] but they are not in the tabernacle yet
[45:31] amen our beginnings still remain the
[45:34] tabernacle and we will be traveling in
[45:36] the tabernacle with ezekiel with john
[45:40] with roof all of those things and the
[45:42] more we travel it gives you more aspect
[45:46] about the holy ghost and the stages of
[45:48] grace amen amen
[45:51] in the tabernacle we know that they are
[45:53] the court
[45:54] and we have also
[45:56] the holy place and the holiest you're
[45:58] coming from the east everybody here the
[46:01] other court we found out that brother
[46:03] branham explained to us that it's
[46:05] justification
[46:06] and then the holy place brother branham
[46:08] say it was sanctification
[46:11] and then we found out that the holiest
[46:14] is the baptism of the holy spirit amen
[46:17] amen all of these apply to an individual
[46:22] amen
[46:23] everybody care amen it doesn't go to the
[46:26] church
[46:27] you must make a difference
[46:29] between the individual and the church
[46:32] everybody okay
[46:34] when we're dealing with the churches
[46:37] we have four stages
[46:40] did you get it yes sir amen i'm trying
[46:43] to help you because on sunday we're
[46:44] moving again deeper
[46:46] so with individual you got three stages
[46:50] because we are a tabernacle ourself we
[46:53] got the body we got the soul we got the
[46:56] spirit amen the body is your other court
[46:59] the soul ah the spirit is the holy place
[47:02] and the soul is the holiest everybody
[47:04] okay but when you're dealing with the
[47:06] church as an age
[47:08] because you as an individual
[47:11] you as a tabernacle you are the bride of
[47:13] jesus christ amen but you are not the
[47:15] only one
[47:16] it's a many members brother
[47:19] and those broad started all the way from
[47:21] paul
[47:22] all the way to laodicea everybody clear
[47:25] so when we talk about the church ages
[47:28] we go through four stages
[47:31] the first age is luther
[47:34] you get it
[47:36] is luther and from luther you go through
[47:39] wesley
[47:41] everybody okay
[47:42] from wesley you go through pentecost
[47:45] remember this is pretty good
[47:47] and from pentecost you enter the broad
[47:50] age
[47:53] everybody okay so far
[47:54] so this is where
[47:56] brother branham said that
[47:59] justification
[48:01] made the way to sanctification make
[48:04] sense don't apply it here you're going
[48:06] to get lost
[48:08] amen everybody okay
[48:10] the stages of grace for an individual
[48:12] remain three
[48:14] because god is perfected in three but
[48:16] when it comes to the church ages
[48:19] that's when you get forward
[48:21] anybody okay
[48:23] did i lose somebody
[48:25] this is where brother branham said that
[48:27] justification
[48:30] made way to sanctification
[48:33] and sanctification
[48:35] made way to the baptism
[48:39] of the holy ghost
[48:40] this baptism
[48:42] is for the restoration
[48:46] of the gifts
[48:48] this is what happened in azusa street
[48:51] when the holy ghost came and the gift of
[48:53] the spirit came back to the church
[48:56] because those gifts were lost
[48:58] god restored the gift and people began
[49:00] to speak in tongues interpret and doing
[49:02] all kinds of stuff everybody okay
[49:04] the non-gift of the spirit then the
[49:06] baptism of the holy ghost make way to
[49:09] the holy ghost himself
[49:12] everybody care
[49:13] this is where brother branham said the
[49:15] shark i mean the tesla the what is the
[49:18] next one but robert
[49:20] the blade the torso this is the shark
[49:24] pentecost and this is the seed the grain
[49:28] anybody here so the error we've been
[49:31] coding this quote here
[49:34] telling the people justification make
[49:36] way to sanctification sanctification
[49:38] make the way to the baptism of the holy
[49:40] ghost and the baptism of the holy ghost
[49:42] made way to the holy ghost when you
[49:44] preach that to people you must be
[49:45] specific
[49:47] amen because it looks like you're
[49:49] telling somebody you're going to have
[49:51] the baptism of the holy ghost then
[49:53] you're going to have the holy ghost
[49:54] again
[49:55] and when you go through other sermon
[49:58] brother branham said the baptism of the
[50:00] holy ghost and the holy ghost is the
[50:02] same thing
[50:03] now you get confused because you applied
[50:06] it wrong amen everybody here for human
[50:09] being
[50:10] the baptism of the holy ghost and the
[50:12] holy ghost is the same thing
[50:15] everybody okay
[50:16] anybody okay but for the church ages the
[50:19] church has an age everybody okay you
[50:22] need to understand these differences
[50:24] everybody okay so far
[50:26] did we lose somebody did we help you up
[50:30] so roof move from her mother if it's ten
[50:32] minutes you tell me about robert roof
[50:34] move from
[50:36] do you see that
[50:37] you can go back there if you want to
[50:40] roof moved from her mother house from
[50:43] idolatry all the way to naomi's house
[50:47] a man
[50:48] where she was in the camp of israel but
[50:51] she's not in the tabernacle yet anybody
[50:54] okay when she left the house of naomi
[50:58] and went into the way of return you
[51:00] remember on sunday
[51:02] the way of return
[51:04] through judah
[51:06] anybody okay that's where she made the
[51:09] decision
[51:11] everybody okay and brother branham said
[51:13] when ruth
[51:14] made the decision
[51:16] that is justification
[51:19] did you hear
[51:20] so brother brandon was telling you that
[51:22] when ruth was taken or making a decision
[51:26] she was already in the other court
[51:30] because in the other court when you
[51:32] enter the gate the first thing you see
[51:35] is the brazen altar
[51:36] everybody okay
[51:38] then you see the level you must repent
[51:41] here
[51:42] and then you can be baptized everybody
[51:44] okay so once you get here
[51:47] the other court have many aspects we
[51:50] spoke about the light of the other court
[51:52] we spoke about you being in
[51:54] justification there is a snake that is
[51:57] still there you still filthy but god
[52:00] removed the guiltiness that's why you
[52:02] can live and clean and you still come to
[52:04] church you're still right here amen but
[52:07] that stage also doesn't stop in that if
[52:10] i stop right there this is all you're
[52:12] going to remember and when you see
[52:13] brother brown i'm speaking in a
[52:15] different direction you will miss it so
[52:17] the other direction is under this stage
[52:20] right at the beginning of that stage you
[52:22] must make a decision amen this is when
[52:25] we tell people you need to come to the
[52:27] altar
[52:28] but if you don't explain that altar
[52:30] correctly the people will get to the
[52:33] altar by emotion
[52:36] everybody here that's why brother
[52:38] branham said billy graham will have 30
[52:40] 000 people converted
[52:42] and then the next year all of them are
[52:44] gone
[52:45] this is the reason why you see people in
[52:47] the message for 20 years and after a
[52:49] while the message is wrong they don't
[52:51] believe the message again and they go
[52:52] out
[52:53] they didn't have the holy ghost
[52:56] amen
[52:58] amen here when you are sealed with the
[53:01] holy ghost
[53:02] you can never be lost again
[53:05] you are here until the day of redemption
[53:09] everybody okay so if you get here you
[53:12] need to check what was the decision that
[53:14] was taken here because brother branham
[53:16] said on sunday that the decision you
[53:19] take here will either take you to hell
[53:21] or it's gonna take you to the baptism of
[53:23] the holy spirit if you move here wrong
[53:26] like judah you can progress here but
[53:29] you're gonna get blocked to someone amen
[53:32] everybody okay so far
[53:34] cornelius was a good man
[53:37] cornelius was a sanctified man
[53:40] no holy ghost
[53:43] anybody okay amen do you know how many
[53:46] disciples saw jesus going up in the
[53:48] rupture
[53:50] how many
[53:52] 500
[53:53] how many went to the upper room
[53:56] 120 where was the other one
[53:59] have you thought about it if you need
[54:01] that scripture you ask me where they say
[54:03] 500 people so jesus going up amen out of
[54:07] 500 only
[54:09] went here all the disciples stuck here
[54:13] because the veil of the temple was not
[54:15] broken yet amen jesus prepared them all
[54:18] the way to sanctification that's why
[54:21] jesus told them you go stay in jerusalem
[54:24] and you wait until the power comes from
[54:26] on eye
[54:27] that power when it comes it's gonna burn
[54:30] the snake
[54:31] everybody okay and he put the white dog
[54:34] inside of you
[54:36] then your battle is between the white
[54:39] dog in your soul and the black dog in
[54:42] the body now you are like the indian
[54:45] giver
[54:46] everybody here but the problem is many
[54:48] people are still here with two
[54:50] dogs and the two dogs are black
[54:54] that's why you struggle
[55:01] amen we are shaking you to put you into
[55:04] place anybody okay
[55:07] so brother brown i'm saying the wolf
[55:09] taking a decision is here
[55:12] roof serving is here we have not gotten
[55:14] there yet and then roof resting is here
[55:17] because the rest is your baptism of the
[55:19] holy spirit
[55:20] everybody okay but we are still right
[55:22] here at the altar
[55:24] what was the decision rook made
[55:27] it's easy we can say my people will be
[55:30] your people my god will be what does it
[55:32] mean my people what does it mean your
[55:35] god will be my god
[55:36] it's not the way you think
[55:38] it's telling you something your decision
[55:41] will separate you completely
[55:45] amen
[55:46] anybody care in other words when you are
[55:48] taking
[55:49] this decision you are actually dying
[55:54] amen
[55:55] amen
[55:57] let all that right here
[55:59] and lord willing we will enter the
[56:01] brazen altar because your boss opened
[56:04] the brazen altar
[56:06] amen okay amen so keep staying in prayer
[56:10] don't wait till we get here
[56:12] if you sense syria here the holy ghost
[56:15] can pick you up right there
[56:18] everybody here amen this is why you saw
[56:21] the house of cornelius they got the holy
[56:23] ghost then peter tell them you got here
[56:26] you forget deliver
[56:28] go back again and get baptized not to
[56:31] receive the holy ghost because it's
[56:33] essential
[56:37] all of them is in the tabernacle so
[56:39] don't get confused don't go sideways
[56:42] just keep these as we're moving roof
[56:44] from here because naomi told roof
[56:48] you need to follow your sister who went
[56:51] back to where
[56:53] her god
[56:54] go go read your scripture in other words
[56:57] when all per missed this
[57:00] she's going back not in the house of
[57:02] naomi
[57:03] she's going back again
[57:08] everybody okay so if that decision is
[57:11] not correct brother brad i'm saying you
[57:12] need to search god where you left him
[57:15] and you need to go right there and
[57:17] correct what you did because brother
[57:19] branham said if you were baptized and
[57:22] you don't receive the holy spirit yet he
[57:25] says something is wrong with where you
[57:27] started
[57:29] because the holy spirit is god approving
[57:31] your faith amen amen everybody okay you
[57:35] must receive a faith somewhere here
[57:37] everybody here and that faith need to go
[57:40] through stages
[57:43] oh my god amen everybody okay when that
[57:46] faith goes through sages when god is
[57:48] pleased with the faith
[57:50] god comes and marry
[57:55] and marry that faith
[57:57] and pull it up
[57:58] then you get the seal of circumcision
[58:01] everybody okay amen so don't look at
[58:03] your ears in the message
[58:06] amen i keep telling you that
[58:09] because the old folks are the one that
[58:11] can miss it quickly
[58:14] anybody care don't look at that
[58:17] measure it with your life
[58:19] be very sincere to yourself look at the
[58:22] life you have been living 20 years look
[58:25] at the life you have been living five
[58:26] years look at the life you have been
[58:28] living 10 years and check that life if
[58:31] that life is not really
[58:35] projecting the word
[58:37] you miss something or
[58:39] you are in a certain stage here
[58:42] and the devil keep playing around with
[58:44] you that's why your life is up down up
[58:48] down up down up down and you don't
[58:50] understand why
[58:52] and we cannot continue with you like
[58:54] that
[58:55] amen
[58:56] we need to help you find out where you
[58:58] are
[58:59] then you would know how to pray to get
[59:01] where you're supposed to be amen

[1:02:44] amen
[1:02:45] one time he took ezekiel and he grabbed
[1:02:47] him by the back of the neck
[1:02:49] and raised him up
[1:02:52] and raised him up and said i want to
[1:02:53] show you something

[1:02:59] heavenly places

[1:03:28] evening my i love him

[1:03:45] isaiah
[1:03:47] 28 i want to look at
[1:03:51] verse 7

[1:03:56] few of the scriptures here

[1:04:00] just thank you tonight god
[1:04:04] lord that you'd call a people
[1:04:06] by your name
[1:04:08] and god when you called us we would come
[1:04:10] and assemble
[1:04:13] lord not around a man or
[1:04:15] an idea tonight
[1:04:18] god i believe
[1:04:19] we're gathered around a word
[1:04:23] and god it's not a an intellectual word
[1:04:25] but it's a
[1:04:26] it's a living breathing
[1:04:29] person tonight god
[1:04:32] it's a truth
[1:04:33] not just a truth you said you were the
[1:04:36] truth tonight god
[1:04:37] and lord we've come together have thy
[1:04:40] own way with us
[1:04:42] and we'll be sure to praise you
[1:04:44] in jesus christ's name amen
[1:04:47] and amen in isaiah
[1:04:50] chapter 28 and verse 7.
[1:04:54] but they also
[1:04:56] have aired through wine
[1:04:59] and through strong drink
[1:05:00] are out of the way
[1:05:03] the priest and the prophet have erred
[1:05:05] through strong drink
[1:05:07] they are swallowed up
[1:05:09] of wine
[1:05:10] they are out of the way through strong
[1:05:12] drink
[1:05:14] they air in vision
[1:05:16] they stumble
[1:05:18] in judgment
[1:05:19] for all tables are full of vomit and
[1:05:23] filthiness
[1:05:24] so that there is no place
[1:05:27] clean
[1:05:29] no place
[1:05:31] no place you say well we're clean
[1:05:34] no place
[1:05:36] clean
[1:05:38] no place
[1:05:40] verse 9
[1:05:41] whom shall he teach knowledge
[1:05:44] whom shall he teach and whom shall he
[1:05:47] make to understand doctrine
[1:05:50] where doctrine means a report
[1:05:52] or a message
[1:05:54] amen
[1:05:56] them that are weaned from the milk and
[1:06:00] drawn from the breast
[1:06:02] you might be seated this evening i mean
[1:06:04] the lord add his blessings to the
[1:06:05] reading of the word
[1:06:07] i want to look this evening
[1:06:10] and
[1:06:10] just lord teach us
[1:06:13] lord teach us
[1:06:15] and
[1:06:16] and if i was i i
[1:06:19] was going to islet pentecostal babies
[1:06:23] but i want to look kind of at the the
[1:06:25] effect here of what he said
[1:06:28] whom
[1:06:30] shall he teach knowledge
[1:06:33] whom
[1:06:34] shall he teach
[1:06:35] and his isaiah is
[1:06:37] is prophesying
[1:06:39] as he's looking and he's going he says
[1:06:41] whom shall he teach knowledge into whom
[1:06:44] shall he it says to whom shall he make
[1:06:47] to understand whom who is he going to
[1:06:49] make to understand doctrine them that
[1:06:51] are weaned
[1:06:52] from the milk
[1:06:54] so we we look and we see as isaiah is
[1:06:56] talking about this there's there's
[1:06:58] something that happens
[1:07:01] from when a baby is is is is on the milk
[1:07:04] and
[1:07:05] and he's having to be served by his
[1:07:07] mother and he's he's having to be
[1:07:09] attached
[1:07:11] to his mother
[1:07:12] that god god is is not looking to teach
[1:07:15] those that are still attached
[1:07:17] to their mother
[1:07:19] he's not looking to teach those that
[1:07:21] aren't yet weaned away
[1:07:23] from somewhere they once were
[1:07:26] so their takes something in the life of
[1:07:29] a believer that separates them from
[1:07:32] something they used to be a part of
[1:07:35] and to the believer the problem with
[1:07:37] israel is they weren't separated
[1:07:40] they weren't separated from their
[1:07:43] days of just
[1:07:46] going about
[1:07:47] see they came out of egypt but yet they
[1:07:50] weren't completely separated
[1:07:52] and so when they come out of egypt and
[1:07:54] they entered into another land they
[1:07:57] they they begin to attach to that other
[1:07:59] land
[1:08:00] and as they walk through god would tell
[1:08:03] them now do not attach do not get in bed
[1:08:06] with but but destroy everything that
[1:08:08] lays before you and do not get
[1:08:11] connected to the philistines or the
[1:08:14] amorites or the hittites or any of those
[1:08:18] other nations because when you do you'll
[1:08:20] begin to pick up their ideas
[1:08:23] you will begin to pick up their
[1:08:25] traditions you will begin to act as they
[1:08:28] act and see god didn't want his people
[1:08:31] to act like any other nation
[1:08:34] or any other denomination
[1:08:37] amen
[1:08:39] so so we see
[1:08:41] that that isaiah is
[1:08:44] talking to a people that will we'll see
[1:08:47] reflected even in an hour that we're
[1:08:50] living
[1:08:52] because israel
[1:08:54] here in the first verse he says woe to
[1:08:56] the crown of pride
[1:09:00] to the drunkards of ephraim now ephraim
[1:09:04] e from we know is the is the ten tribes
[1:09:07] of the
[1:09:08] of israel
[1:09:10] so this this isn't people that don't
[1:09:12] know god
[1:09:16] this isn't people that have never heard
[1:09:18] of god
[1:09:20] this isn't somebody that's just pure
[1:09:22] heathens
[1:09:23] this is a religious people
[1:09:26] [Music]
[1:09:27] this is the people that maybe even from
[1:09:30] birth were raised up
[1:09:32] but they never broke free
[1:09:37] so
[1:09:38] here we're looking at and and you notice
[1:09:41] whose glorious beauty
[1:09:44] is a fading flower
[1:09:46] see they didn't recognize this they
[1:09:48] thought the beauty that they once had
[1:09:50] would always be
[1:09:52] they thought that where somebody once
[1:09:54] said they they come into a church they
[1:09:56] they maybe would have got at an altar as
[1:09:58] we say or or got baptized they thought
[1:10:00] my this is the beauty and the glory and
[1:10:02] they thought my this will never fade but
[1:10:04] they but the problem is a lot of times
[1:10:06] people come in and they get a tradition
[1:10:09] from a church before from another age
[1:10:12] that's crept over into this age thus
[1:10:14] they picked up tradition
[1:10:16] and we brought tradition over from age
[1:10:19] unto age unto age unto age and thus
[1:10:22] every age that birthed another age it
[1:10:26] never got separated from the mother it
[1:10:28] was birthed out of amen now we will find
[1:10:31] it over in revelations when he talks
[1:10:33] about a great that had many
[1:10:35] harlots and brother branham would teach
[1:10:37] us that what are those he said those are
[1:10:39] the birth children of the mother
[1:10:41] that she birthed the children and now
[1:10:44] you know the prophet of god would teach
[1:10:46] us that a child when it is birthed in
[1:10:48] that state it is innocent and it doesn't
[1:10:50] know any better but yet as it is grown
[1:10:53] up it is taught under the hand of mother
[1:10:56] and it returns right back to what mother
[1:10:59] did and there's where she becomes a
[1:11:01] harlot
[1:11:03] she's not a hurley when she came out but
[1:11:05] when she returned back she became a
[1:11:08] harlot
[1:11:09] and old saints when luther came out he
[1:11:11] come out clean but when she went back in
[1:11:14] she became a harlot
[1:11:16] oh when wesley come out she come out
[1:11:19] clean but when they went back in they
[1:11:21] became a hurlet
[1:11:23] pentecost when they come out clean they
[1:11:25] went back in they become a hurlet
[1:11:28] don't stop with me now because when this
[1:11:31] message came out it came out clean but
[1:11:33] it went right back to a hurlet
[1:11:38] why did it go back because it kept the
[1:11:40] tradition of the church before it
[1:11:43] it will not separate but in this hour
[1:11:46] god is causing a separation
[1:11:49] of a bride amen from the shark amen it's
[1:11:52] going to be like nothing you've ever
[1:11:54] seen before
[1:11:57] because listen sayings
[1:12:00] he's teaching
[1:12:02] a people
[1:12:05] paul said man cannot teach us but the
[1:12:08] spirit has taught us
[1:12:10] yea the deep things of god
[1:12:13] [Applause]
[1:12:14] [Music]
[1:12:16] man does not know man no man knoweth the
[1:12:19] hour
[1:12:22] no man knoweth the hour amen but the
[1:12:24] prophet has taught us in this hour
[1:12:27] amen that something is coming
[1:12:31] and no man we can't figure it out in our
[1:12:33] minds
[1:12:34] gloria i can't figure it out
[1:12:37] i can't read enough i can't study enough
[1:12:39] i can't understand enough i can't sit in
[1:12:41] church and by my own intellect know it
[1:12:44] enough but praise god he has a way of
[1:12:47] teaching this bride
[1:12:51] he's got a weight that's above every
[1:12:53] other way he's got a weight that's
[1:12:55] higher than my waist he's got a way
[1:12:57] that's higher than your waist all tables
[1:12:59] are full of vomit this morning this
[1:13:01] evening amen every bit that man can do
[1:13:03] is full of vomit this evening
[1:13:06] amen if i teach you one thing tonight
[1:13:08] it's full of vomit amen but if god
[1:13:10] himself amen by the supernatural power
[1:13:13] amen can teach us something amen it'll
[1:13:16] be something we'll never forget
[1:13:19] because it'll be an eternal lesson
[1:13:21] glory
[1:13:22] it won't be something man has taught us
[1:13:24] it won't be something man has worked out
[1:13:27] but it'll be something god teaches this
[1:13:29] little bride
[1:13:30] this is a woman that's not manhandled
[1:13:32] she's not guided by the hand of man she
[1:13:34] is guided by the hand of almighty god
[1:13:38] glory
[1:13:40] oh my to think about it tonight that god
[1:13:42] so loved you
[1:13:46] that he wouldn't allow another man to
[1:13:48] teach you because he was going to come
[1:13:49] teach you himself
[1:13:53] he so loved you that he wasn't going to
[1:13:55] let another come save you he was going
[1:13:57] to save you
[1:13:58] himself oh my this is the same god that
[1:14:01] wasn't going to let another touch your
[1:14:03] emotions he was going to touch you
[1:14:05] himself
[1:14:07] oh my he has called us into this secret
[1:14:09] place
[1:14:11] he so loved us
[1:14:13] so longed for us that he created he made
[1:14:16] a law wrote it on tables with his own
[1:14:19] finger amen just so that fallen man
[1:14:21] could be in contact with a heavenly god
[1:14:25] you say that was a law
[1:14:27] and only one could get into that place
[1:14:29] and there was a high priest once a year
[1:14:31] could go in and he had to be dressed a
[1:14:33] certain way he had to be anointed a
[1:14:35] certain way he had a group of wise
[1:14:37] makers amen that were that were that
[1:14:39] were anointed by god himself to make the
[1:14:42] garments that he was going to wear and
[1:14:44] when they put it upon this high priest
[1:14:46] and he went through all of this and he
[1:14:48] got layered up in all his clothes and
[1:14:50] put on his head and put on the urination
[1:14:52] and put everything in place it wasn't
[1:14:54] for that man just to go in and be
[1:14:56] somebody but there was something on the
[1:14:58] inside of the holiest of the holies amen
[1:15:01] it was longing for a fellowship amen a
[1:15:03] man wasn't clean enough to get there god
[1:15:05] had to make a way for him
[1:15:08] and so he took moses into the heavens
[1:15:10] and showed him the way and come back and
[1:15:12] gave him a word that god could have
[1:15:14] fellowship
[1:15:18] he could teach us
[1:15:20] that he could show us
[1:15:23] mother he could unveil himself to us
[1:15:27] then it wasn't even good enough but he
[1:15:28] had a way that one day a man was going
[1:15:30] to come
[1:15:31] he was going to come himself
[1:15:33] hey mean the world wouldn't know him the
[1:15:35] world wouldn't seem the world wouldn't
[1:15:37] understand him but he was going to come
[1:15:38] to a people
[1:15:42] and he was going to do things that no
[1:15:43] other man would do
[1:15:44] [Music]
[1:15:47] yet he had the whole power of the world
[1:15:48] that he could have spoke
[1:15:50] and pulled himself off he could have
[1:15:52] spoke and removed himself out of harm's
[1:15:55] way he could have done any of these
[1:15:56] things but yet god
[1:16:01] knew the plan
[1:16:04] he knew the plan
[1:16:07] he knew the plan
[1:16:09] he didn't he didn't even tell the devil
[1:16:11] about it
[1:16:12] because the devil surely
[1:16:14] wouldn't hung him on a cross if he knew
[1:16:17] glory
[1:16:19] listen it wasn't the devil that hung
[1:16:20] jesus on the cross
[1:16:22] it wasn't it wasn't it wasn't a punch of
[1:16:24] pile it wasn't under them that hung him
[1:16:26] on a cross it was god himself he said
[1:16:30] you have no power over me
[1:16:37] [Music]
[1:16:44] god would give it to you
[1:16:48] and god's want to teach us these things
[1:16:51] but how can he teach us if we don't want
[1:16:53] to not
[1:16:54] if we want to keep staying stuck where
[1:16:56] we were
[1:16:58] amen so here in israel as they were in
[1:17:02] isaiah they were
[1:17:03] they were stuck and they were coming and
[1:17:05] you look how it refers to drunkenness
[1:17:07] and wine and and and constantly that now
[1:17:09] it's not just the the natural
[1:17:11] don't look look
[1:17:14] no they weren't drunk with that kind of
[1:17:15] wine
[1:17:16] just as they were at pentecost weren't
[1:17:18] drunk with that kind of wine
[1:17:20] amen but they were drunk with the wine
[1:17:23] of the seduction
[1:17:25] and the influence of everything around
[1:17:28] them to where they got lord into a state
[1:17:33] to where they could sit there
[1:17:36] and to where even the priest he said and
[1:17:37] the prophet themselves were drunken with
[1:17:39] this wine down through the ages they
[1:17:42] fell under the drunkness of that wine to
[1:17:44] where to where even they lost the vision
[1:17:46] and they begin to guide the people by a
[1:17:48] drunken fault
[1:17:50] amen so they begin and and so we see how
[1:17:53] that it is even down through the church
[1:17:54] ages and everything
[1:17:56] walks in parallel with with israel back
[1:17:59] in the day because it's god showing us
[1:18:03] who he is
[1:18:06] and that he's unchanging
[1:18:09] and what he's
[1:18:10] doing that's why he'd say he that began
[1:18:13] a good work in you
[1:18:15] he is faithful
[1:18:17] he is faithful
[1:18:20] he's faithful this evening
[1:18:23] but here israel got
[1:18:24] pulled in and he said all tables are
[1:18:26] full of vomit
[1:18:27] whom shall i teach knowledge to whoms
[1:18:29] they'll make to understand doctrine
[1:18:31] they're a message
[1:18:33] he said but why don't you say them that
[1:18:35] are weaned from the milk and drawn from
[1:18:36] the breast
[1:18:38] and then it goes and he says for precept
[1:18:39] must be upon precept precept upon
[1:18:41] precept line upon line line upon line
[1:18:45] here a little and there a little and
[1:18:47] then it goes forward with a stammering
[1:18:48] lips and another tongue will he speak to
[1:18:51] this people
[1:18:54] now that's not that's not just a gift of
[1:18:56] tongues talking but this was israel that
[1:18:59] was so engulfed in the
[1:19:02] national
[1:19:04] language
[1:19:05] and so
[1:19:06] lord asleep and where they were and they
[1:19:10] had precept upon precept
[1:19:13] they had lying upon line they had a law
[1:19:17] that they knew they had a tables of
[1:19:19] stone that they studied with their
[1:19:21] intellect they had every they had
[1:19:24] preachers preaching they had a they had
[1:19:26] a beautiful church set up they were lord
[1:19:29] into thinking it's okay
[1:19:36] they had a they were they were
[1:19:38] they were they were lawed into just i'm
[1:19:41] going to say they were lulled into
[1:19:42] lukewarm
[1:19:45] glory they were lord and like over in
[1:19:47] the over in revelation where we find the
[1:19:50] church of the laodiceans
[1:19:52] it wasn't the church at ephesus or the
[1:19:54] church of emphasis of the church of
[1:19:55] smyrna or the church of philadelphia or
[1:19:58] the church of this but it was now it
[1:20:00] wasn't a church of a nation but it was a
[1:20:01] church of the people
[1:20:03] because it had so engulfed that it
[1:20:05] wasn't now it had nothing to do with the
[1:20:07] church in the land but now that people
[1:20:09] had made it their church
[1:20:13] to where they were in control of
[1:20:14] everything
[1:20:17] listen think listen listen
[1:20:19] listen they were in control of
[1:20:22] everything
[1:20:24] they were in control of who god saved
[1:20:26] and who didn't get saved
[1:20:28] they got in control of who got to come
[1:20:30] in and who didn't get to come in they
[1:20:32] were now in control of going through the
[1:20:34] checklist to find out if they passed or
[1:20:36] not they had us they had a code that boy
[1:20:39] if you didn't meet this you weren't in
[1:20:41] because it was now their church but the
[1:20:43] problem with it was is that
[1:20:46] the one they were supposed to be
[1:20:47] worshiping was on the outside
[1:20:51] but they have precept they have lines
[1:20:54] they have a book they have a quote they
[1:20:56] have all of these things
[1:21:02] have all of that stuff
[1:21:06] but
[1:21:07] he was looking
[1:21:08] and so he said with a stammering lips
[1:21:10] and if you go and you look into the
[1:21:12] history of it that that's where god was
[1:21:14] saying listen you're settled in over
[1:21:16] here in ephraim and all of this
[1:21:17] drunkenness and everything but i'm going
[1:21:18] to bring in another nation
[1:21:21] a whole nother i'm going to bring
[1:21:22] assyrians in here and they are going to
[1:21:24] wipe you out
[1:21:26] and that is a nation of another language
[1:21:28] and it's with a stammering lips of
[1:21:31] another language of another nation that
[1:21:33] i am going to take this people
[1:21:38] but in that sweeping
[1:21:41] he was saying i'm going outside of your
[1:21:43] precepts
[1:21:46] because my the precepts aren't doing it
[1:21:51] it's not doing it so what i'm going to
[1:21:53] do is i'm going to come into your life
[1:21:57] i'm going to knock on your door
[1:21:59] and it's going to be above your
[1:22:01] understanding
[1:22:04] see church can't teach you how to get
[1:22:06] saved oh but god knows how to put you in
[1:22:09] position to where you got nowhere else
[1:22:11] to run
[1:22:12] oh my it we don't it don't take me to
[1:22:15] show you how you need to be it takes god
[1:22:18] to put you in position
[1:22:19] [Music]
[1:22:21] how does he put you he takes everything
[1:22:23] in your life amen and he wipes you clean
[1:22:25] amen there's nothing else left but him
[1:22:28] alone
[1:22:31] who am i to think about it who can god
[1:22:34] teach this to
[1:22:36] [Music]
[1:22:37] he that has an ear to hear let him hear
[1:22:39] what the spirit's saying amen so the
[1:22:42] spirit has now come to teach
[1:22:44] but who's he going to teach
[1:22:46] those that have an ear
[1:22:49] oh my those that have an ear they hear
[1:22:51] the sound of a true prophet that hear
[1:22:54] the sound of a true prophet they hear
[1:22:56] the sound of the messiah speaking and
[1:22:59] they move according to his word
[1:23:02] amen
[1:23:04] watch because even isaiah said over in
[1:23:06] 53 he said whom
[1:23:08] who hath believed our report
[1:23:11] same word as as doctrine who hath
[1:23:14] believed i report
[1:23:16] and to whom
[1:23:18] is the arm or the power
[1:23:20] of the lord revealed
[1:23:24] who to whom is the the arm or we'll say
[1:23:27] the power of the lord revealed paul said
[1:23:30] in this place he said i didn't come to
[1:23:32] you with enticing words of man's wisdom
[1:23:37] that word enticing means persuasive
[1:23:40] so see paul didn't get up with the idea
[1:23:42] to preach and to try to persuade
[1:23:45] somebody to serve this god
[1:23:48] oh he's going to give you he's going to
[1:23:49] give you a new car he's going to make
[1:23:51] everything all right he's you know
[1:23:53] you're going
[1:23:54] he didn't even get upset you know you're
[1:23:55] going to make it to heaven it's a
[1:23:56] beautiful land i want you to go to
[1:23:57] heaven with me mama's over there waiting
[1:23:59] on you i don't want you to miss it
[1:24:02] see always trying to emotionally
[1:24:04] persuade somebody
[1:24:07] to serve almighty god
[1:24:10] like god can't do it himself
[1:24:12] oh but god is able
[1:24:15] my god is able
[1:24:17] to go beyond my ability to go above and
[1:24:21] beyond our ability to perform his mighty
[1:24:24] will
[1:24:27] glory
[1:24:29] so we see you here that he said what was
[1:24:31] it
[1:24:33] who's going to believe who
[1:24:35] they couldn't they couldn't comprehend
[1:24:39] they couldn't comprehend because there
[1:24:40] he went on to say who's going to
[1:24:43] verse 2 for he shall grow up before him
[1:24:44] as a tender plant
[1:24:46] and as a root out of a dry ground
[1:24:50] he hath no form nor calmliness
[1:24:53] and when we shall see him there is no
[1:24:56] beauty
[1:24:59] that we
[1:25:00] should even desire him
[1:25:03] my let that soak just a second
[1:25:06] you're not even gonna desire this
[1:25:13] a man in his right mind won't desire
[1:25:15] this
[1:25:16] amen
[1:25:18] a man in his right mind won't desire to
[1:25:20] serve a true living god
[1:25:22] because there god is going to take him
[1:25:23] and detach him from everything you take
[1:25:26] i heard him talking something about ruth
[1:25:28] he is going to take and detach them from
[1:25:30] everything they've ever known
[1:25:33] because he wants to teach you his ways
[1:25:35] and he don't need your old ways because
[1:25:37] he wants to show you his ways our ways
[1:25:40] have always been wrong but his or the
[1:25:42] right way
[1:25:44] jeremiah said seek out the old ways not
[1:25:48] the old ways of man but the original
[1:25:51] ways of god before the earth fell there
[1:25:54] was a god that had a way
[1:25:56] and in this hour god is restoring us to
[1:25:59] that way
[1:26:01] he's not taking us back to pentecost
[1:26:04] he's not taking us back to some other
[1:26:06] day he's taking us back before there was
[1:26:10] oh my saints
[1:26:15] and that's why he's wondering who can he
[1:26:17] teach this to
[1:26:18] who can he teach this to can't teach it
[1:26:20] to the churches
[1:26:22] can't teach it to the church members
[1:26:24] can't teach it to those that are still
[1:26:26] hanging on mama's breast can't teach
[1:26:28] those
[1:26:29] but he's got to detach
[1:26:33] he's got to detach us
[1:26:36] from what is so comfortable
[1:26:38] [Music]
[1:26:41] he's got to detach us from what is so
[1:26:44] our precepts become comfortable
[1:26:48] our quotes become comfortable
[1:26:51] our ideas become so comfortable until we
[1:26:54] until we scoot them up into a nice
[1:26:56] little nest around us
[1:26:58] and this is well i believe it this way
[1:27:00] and and i it's the way my my mama taught
[1:27:03] me and my mama taught me and oh pastor
[1:27:06] so-and-so taught me but god says but who
[1:27:08] can i teach
[1:27:11] who can i teach
[1:27:13] see god wants to teach this little bride
[1:27:16] something
[1:27:23] now brother branham said in the in the
[1:27:24] seventh seal there he said a voice come
[1:27:28] and said you can't teach pentecostal
[1:27:30] babies supernatural things
[1:27:34] and then he said now let them alone
[1:27:41] let them alone
[1:27:43] but we want to save everybody no he said
[1:27:46] let them alone
[1:27:48] let them alone
[1:27:51] you know
[1:27:53] jesus
[1:27:55] in the midst of his ministry he stopped
[1:27:57] and he turned and he said remember lot's
[1:28:00] wife
[1:28:02] remember lot's
[1:28:04] wife
[1:28:06] why did our lord and savior standing on
[1:28:08] earth go back to her because our prophet
[1:28:10] picked up and said in this hour said the
[1:28:12] problem with lot's wife and what got her
[1:28:13] to turn back was her grandkids over
[1:28:15] there
[1:28:18] see the emotional tug of natural things
[1:28:21] that will turn her back to a pillar of
[1:28:23] salt and our lord when he was trying to
[1:28:25] teach the disciples he said don't let
[1:28:28] your emotions get in the way of what i'm
[1:28:31] showing you
[1:28:34] because he's going to take you through
[1:28:35] things that your friends aren't going to
[1:28:37] like
[1:28:38] he's going to put you in positions that
[1:28:39] that maybe the pastor won't like
[1:28:42] but what it's don't turn back to what
[1:28:45] used to be when you know that you're in
[1:28:47] his plan
[1:28:53] oh my if i can if oh oh if if i can
[1:28:57] lord lord please let's go back and save
[1:29:00] the grandkids
[1:29:04] he said we can't
[1:29:06] don't look back honey god's god is going
[1:29:09] somewhere
[1:29:10] we're leaving that behind
[1:29:14] amen
[1:29:15] oh my god
[1:29:19] now watch because we see the the
[1:29:21] condition that we're in and we didn't
[1:29:23] get here overnight
[1:29:25] we didn't get settled into church entity
[1:29:27] overnight
[1:29:29] we didn't pick up our traditions from
[1:29:31] just our father these things have been
[1:29:32] laid in here for instance grandfather
[1:29:35] and great grandfather
[1:29:37] we think while we're in the message
[1:29:38] we're outside denominations no that
[1:29:40] denominational spirit sets right in
[1:29:42] amongst
[1:29:43] us tonight
[1:29:46] what is that denominational spirit it's
[1:29:48] i'm okay
[1:29:51] and there ain't no more
[1:29:53] and i'm gonna settle in right here and
[1:29:56] everything's gonna be all right i've
[1:29:57] gotta i've gotta he said it over in
[1:29:59] isaiah said you've gotta you've got a uh
[1:30:01] uh a a a a pact with death and hell
[1:30:07] but that's not going to hold
[1:30:11] it's not going to hold us tonight
[1:30:15] so we see the church listen brother bram
[1:30:17] said in the first seal
[1:30:19] oh it thundered when he spoke it out
[1:30:22] and when he did a white horse rider
[1:30:25] started out
[1:30:27] we know that was what it was the power
[1:30:29] of what he rode on
[1:30:31] what did he ride on watch what he said
[1:30:34] and it still was a symbol
[1:30:37] now once he said it would be known in
[1:30:39] the last day
[1:30:42] where are y'all living
[1:30:44] where are y'all living this evening
[1:30:47] are we in the last day
[1:30:49] amen
[1:30:50] he said it'd be known in the lat now you
[1:30:52] can't go back and ask wesley what this
[1:30:54] was
[1:30:56] you can't go back and ask some pentecost
[1:30:58] what this was
[1:31:00] this is going to take a supernatural
[1:31:02] voice of what you can't go back and ask
[1:31:03] brother branham what were you talking
[1:31:05] about this takes gun to show you what
[1:31:07] this is
[1:31:11] what but it come forth in a church
[1:31:14] symbol
[1:31:18] coming forth in a church do you
[1:31:19] understand it church
[1:31:23] now he's now he's what do you understand
[1:31:25] it church see how close it see how close
[1:31:28] it
[1:31:28] is he come riding on the church
[1:31:32] a symbol of the church
[1:31:33] and that same writer jumped on every
[1:31:36] other age and wrote on out what was he
[1:31:38] doing he was jumping from church age to
[1:31:39] church age and coming through
[1:31:42] [Music]
[1:31:44] amen it comes forth a symbol of a church
[1:31:49] a symbol of a church
[1:31:53] oh that they know there is a seal but
[1:31:55] just what it is yet they don't know
[1:31:57] because it's a white horse rider
[1:32:01] how lovely i lovely so they got their
[1:32:03] idea where'd they get their idea they
[1:32:05] got their idea from the first church and
[1:32:06] it carried over to the next church and
[1:32:08] the same power kept bringing it down
[1:32:10] from age to age
[1:32:12] and so now we get dumped down here at
[1:32:14] the end and what is it
[1:32:16] now it's become the people are so in
[1:32:17] control because that's what they've been
[1:32:19] taught for ages to ages paul didn't
[1:32:21] teach that
[1:32:23] paul didn't teach that brother branham
[1:32:26] didn't teach that
[1:32:29] he said
[1:32:30] he's outside of that knocking
[1:32:33] brother brahman said in the church he
[1:32:35] said what is it he said when you stand
[1:32:36] up there knocking he said that's not a
[1:32:38] single individual plea to somebody's
[1:32:40] heart
[1:32:42] he said that is a telling of where
[1:32:44] christ is in this last day
[1:32:47] it is god sending a prophet pulling a
[1:32:49] curtain down and showing us that christ
[1:32:52] is not in the church
[1:32:54] so why do we want to keep making
[1:32:56] churches
[1:33:02] come on
[1:33:03] you say well wait a second i'm sitting
[1:33:04] in church tonight
[1:33:06] oh no you are made to sit in heavenly
[1:33:10] places
[1:33:12] oh my
[1:33:13] we might be in a in the presence here of
[1:33:15] a church building
[1:33:17] we might be fulfilling like a duty of a
[1:33:19] church but i'm telling you tonight the
[1:33:22] bride has been made to sit in heavenly
[1:33:25] places
[1:33:27] oh how do i get there
[1:33:30] how can i climb up into heavenly places
[1:33:34] no you don't reading it right paul said
[1:33:36] you are made
[1:33:39] by the same one
[1:33:42] that made you in the beginning
[1:33:45] fashioned you in the form of a seed and
[1:33:47] placed you down under that earth and
[1:33:48] waited until this time to shine the
[1:33:51] light of this glorious hour upon you and
[1:33:54] god in his infinite wisdom has come in
[1:33:57] this hour and anointed us in this day
[1:34:00] oh my oh sure and this son all kinds of
[1:34:03] weeds come up with it but that doesn't
[1:34:05] stop the bride
[1:34:07] that don't stop what the bride is to him
[1:34:10] because he's teaching her
[1:34:12] amen so we get called we get to be into
[1:34:14] this thing oh my jesus is so lovely and
[1:34:17] so kind and so wonderful
[1:34:21] yet we don't really know him that good
[1:34:24] watch watch what he said
[1:34:26] here in matthew chapter 15 jesus come to
[1:34:29] the place
[1:34:32] matthew 15 and verse 12
[1:34:34] and then
[1:34:36] he just got done having a little meeting
[1:34:39] and then came his disciples and suddenly
[1:34:40] it said unto him
[1:34:43] notice thou
[1:34:44] that the pharisees were offended
[1:34:48] pastor
[1:34:49] don't you know he offended some this
[1:34:51] morning
[1:34:54] good good good say even the disciples
[1:34:56] you know they was as human as the next
[1:34:58] one they said
[1:34:59] lord don't you know that you've run part
[1:35:01] the church off this morning
[1:35:04] they didn't understand what you were
[1:35:06] saying
[1:35:08] they didn't understand don't you know
[1:35:09] you offended the pharisees
[1:35:12] oh my and he says
[1:35:14] he said what he said after they heard
[1:35:16] this saying but he answered he answered
[1:35:20] he answered
[1:35:22] and said
[1:35:23] every plant which my heavenly father
[1:35:26] hath not planted shall be rooted up
[1:35:32] oh this is our loving this is our loving
[1:35:34] lord
[1:35:36] see we got an image of what we think and
[1:35:38] where did our image of him come from
[1:35:41] most of our images of him came from
[1:35:43] mother
[1:35:47] come on
[1:35:48] most of our images of what god really is
[1:35:50] came from our mother because she tried
[1:35:53] to control him
[1:35:56] oh but when he stood on the earth he
[1:35:58] didn't worry about what mother thought
[1:36:00] he told him and said let him alone
[1:36:03] they'd be offended lord it don't matter
[1:36:06] nothing that my father has not planted
[1:36:08] it'll be rooted up
[1:36:13] it'll be rooted up he says oh you're so
[1:36:14] hard you don't care about people no i
[1:36:18] care i believe the bride cares so much
[1:36:21] that she she knows that it's nothing but
[1:36:23] truth
[1:36:25] that can transform a life
[1:36:27] doctrine won't do it ideas won't do it
[1:36:30] traditions won't do it but all the power
[1:36:33] of god
[1:36:35] there is a sunlight in this hour it's a
[1:36:38] harvest sun
[1:36:40] oh my god
[1:36:42] it's a harvest sun
[1:36:44] and it's going to bring all kinds of
[1:36:45] things up
[1:36:47] oh but it's also bringing the bride up
[1:36:50] i can't
[1:36:53] now let's let's do that you know we
[1:36:55] bought we're offended somebody
[1:36:57] i'm not saying we are tonight but let's
[1:36:58] just you know in our mind we'd think oh
[1:37:00] you're gonna offend somebody okay then
[1:37:02] let's do this let's take the sun and
[1:37:04] turn it down a little bit
[1:37:12] let's let's say like well let's just go
[1:37:14] back to pentecost
[1:37:16] because they had more they had more fun
[1:37:18] in pentecost
[1:37:21] pentecost let me tell pentecost was fun
[1:37:25] oh my they shouted rand jump they didn't
[1:37:27] know what they was jumping and shouting
[1:37:28] about but boy they did it
[1:37:30] they had healings and prayer lines and
[1:37:32] fun and excitement and everything oh man
[1:37:34] it was fun and you felt good when you
[1:37:36] left you felt like man i've done
[1:37:37] something
[1:37:40] but god teaches by a difference
[1:37:43] [Laughter]
[1:37:47] he teaches you like he teaches his own
[1:37:49] son
[1:37:50] he sends you into the wilderness and
[1:37:52] makes you starve
[1:37:55] glory why because he don't want you to
[1:37:57] know anything but him
[1:37:59] he don't want you to know any kind of
[1:38:01] tradition he don't want you to know any
[1:38:03] why because he's got a bride going in a
[1:38:05] rapture
[1:38:07] he didn't send some first grade
[1:38:09] education but he sent himself he came to
[1:38:12] do what
[1:38:16] where is he taking it what is he
[1:38:18] teaching us he's teaching us who we are
[1:38:22] where we come from
[1:38:24] where we're going
[1:38:26] and i don't know about y'all but i
[1:38:28] didn't come from this earth
[1:38:30] so i'm not really worried about fitting
[1:38:32] in with this earth
[1:38:33] i'm not really worried about fitting in
[1:38:35] with these religions
[1:38:36] i'm not really worried about trying to
[1:38:38] study to be more nice in this world oh
[1:38:41] my why because i'm looking to get out of
[1:38:43] here
[1:38:44] hey man i'm keeping my eyes on him and
[1:38:46] if he says oh ignore i'll ignore
[1:38:50] if he says oh this is for the this ain't
[1:38:52] for the dogs i'll say let's not give it
[1:38:54] to him then
[1:38:56] oh but all of a sudden if in that
[1:38:58] situation when they're so highly
[1:39:00] offended something stirs in their heart
[1:39:02] and says truth lord
[1:39:04] then i'm going to know it's not nothing
[1:39:06] that my ability is done
[1:39:08] i haven't been nice enough to pull them
[1:39:10] in
[1:39:14] see we've got
[1:39:15] the church has been set up all along
[1:39:17] to be nice enough to convince people and
[1:39:20] to persuade people to come serve the
[1:39:22] lord
[1:39:23] please come serve god
[1:39:26] we'll give you a place in the church
[1:39:28] we'll do something we'll get you on the
[1:39:30] front row we'll do we'll put you on the
[1:39:32] instrument we'll do something just come
[1:39:33] serve the lord
[1:39:37] oh my god i'm going to teach somebody
[1:39:39] something
[1:39:40] and it ain't nothing you've ever learned
[1:39:42] before
[1:39:45] what are you going to teach us
[1:39:47] well
[1:39:48] we know we know healings we know this we
[1:39:50] know we know all these things you say
[1:39:52] well you don't believe god's a healer i
[1:39:53] believe he's more of a healer now than
[1:39:54] he's ever been
[1:39:58] but we don't have to impersonate what
[1:40:01] brother branham did to get people healed
[1:40:05] amen said we fell into traps
[1:40:08] but what i want i want to show you
[1:40:10] something because paul said in first
[1:40:11] corinthians we know familiar scripture
[1:40:13] for me he said but when that
[1:40:15] he said for we know in part we prophesy
[1:40:17] in part but when that which is perfect
[1:40:19] has come
[1:40:22] i don't know about you but i've got in
[1:40:24] contact with something perfect
[1:40:27] and that perfect don't mean something
[1:40:29] this is better it means something that's
[1:40:31] complete
[1:40:33] something that satisfies above anything
[1:40:36] that's ever satisfied
[1:40:46] and so that which is in part
[1:40:49] it's done away
[1:40:52] but we just
[1:40:54] what
[1:40:55] he said now watch when i was a child
[1:40:57] pentecostal babies
[1:40:59] i spake as a child
[1:41:01] i understood as a child
[1:41:04] i thought
[1:41:10] i sat around with my thoughts as a child
[1:41:14] what can i do for fun today
[1:41:18] i sure hope church is going to be fun
[1:41:19] tonight
[1:41:21] i hope somebody good's going to sing
[1:41:25] i hope i hope the preacher won't be too
[1:41:27] long
[1:41:28] i hope he won't tell you i hope he won't
[1:41:30] take things away from me
[1:41:33] and then i hope when i go to work
[1:41:35] everybody loves me
[1:41:38] i hope i don't get fired
[1:41:40] i hope my wife don't get mad at me
[1:41:44] see but with stammering lips and other
[1:41:46] tugs he's going to teach this little
[1:41:47] bride he's going to come outside the
[1:41:49] realm of what we're used to
[1:41:51] and he's going to flip us upside down so
[1:41:53] that we'll see him
[1:41:57] because he loves us so much that he
[1:41:59] won't let he said i will not leave my
[1:42:01] holy one to suffer corruption
[1:42:04] [Music]
[1:42:07] he may kill you but he won't leave you
[1:42:10] glory
[1:42:12] glory ah glory watch
[1:42:17] i be i became a man i put away childish
[1:42:20] things
[1:42:22] now he said in the realm she said well
[1:42:24] what if moses would have come would have
[1:42:26] brought noah's message
[1:42:28] we'll build an ark and float down the
[1:42:30] nile
[1:42:35] it just wouldn't work
[1:42:36] but we still think pentecostal ideas in
[1:42:39] this message will work
[1:42:43] my we still think pentecostal well there
[1:42:46] was a good church they had to give sure
[1:42:48] they did
[1:42:50] sure they did
[1:42:53] but we're talking about noah and moses
[1:42:55] that's way back it don't affect us
[1:42:59] that don't affect us but
[1:43:01] watch how god does things
[1:43:03] oh it wouldn't have worked
[1:43:05] and now
[1:43:07] listen and neither would jesus message
[1:43:10] have ever worked of moses
[1:43:16] i thought jesus message will work for
[1:43:22] anybody my
[1:43:25] and we'll still worship across
[1:43:32] we'll put that thing up like it's a
[1:43:33] brass serpent
[1:43:35] and think that oh if anybody says
[1:43:37] anything against it oh there'll be a
[1:43:38] curse no
[1:43:41] they said i'm not talking against the
[1:43:42] cross
[1:43:44] no more than the kingdom when he come in
[1:43:45] and he walked over there and the lord
[1:43:46] told him said take that brass serpent
[1:43:48] and break it across your knee
[1:43:50] because that thing had become an idol
[1:43:52] because it tied on to another day
[1:43:56] see there's so many things in this
[1:43:58] message that ties us to another day but
[1:44:01] i believe god in this hour is breaking
[1:44:03] those things down around us listen i'm
[1:44:06] not worried about the people that left
[1:44:08] the message
[1:44:09] i'm worried about the people who are
[1:44:10] satisfied just sitting in the message
[1:44:14] come on better line upon line precept
[1:44:17] upon precept when god has done left that
[1:44:20] thing
[1:44:22] man
[1:44:23] [Music]
[1:44:25] oh my
[1:44:26] god
[1:44:29] how to think
[1:44:30] who can he teach to he can't teach if
[1:44:31] we're just sitting down with our ears
[1:44:33] hands plugged in our ears thinking man
[1:44:35] i'm satisfied i got it all
[1:44:37] my god i ain't got nowhere else to go
[1:44:39] i don't know about you but i'm saying
[1:44:41] lord come quickly and let's go
[1:44:45] oh my god we got our eyes on him lord
[1:44:47] teach us whatever you want
[1:44:49] by thy road and thy steph they comfort
[1:44:51] me
[1:44:52] why don't keep me on the straight and
[1:44:54] then take me and guide me and show me
[1:44:56] lord i don't want it by precept i don't
[1:44:58] want some man to teach me how to live
[1:45:01] but god break it down and take the wound
[1:45:03] out of me
[1:45:06] turn this conscience loose god break
[1:45:09] everything that would tie me to that old
[1:45:11] man
[1:45:13] make me so sick
[1:45:15] of this natural man and his traditions
[1:45:18] that god i hear only you
[1:45:23] i don't precept i don't want lying upon
[1:45:26] line i want the mighty hand of god
[1:45:30] and that's where god has got this little
[1:45:32] bride now
[1:45:34] oh my never work neither will wesley's
[1:45:36] message work over in luther luther's
[1:45:38] message won't vice versa and today
[1:45:41] we are last great reformation was
[1:45:44] pentecost and today we're moving from
[1:45:46] that
[1:45:48] amen
[1:45:49] wow moving from that and the pentecostal
[1:45:52] message won't mix
[1:45:55] with this
[1:45:57] that's another day listen to rapture
[1:46:00] 1965
[1:46:03] and watch teaching
[1:46:05] teaching us lord
[1:46:07] teaches god
[1:46:09] i'm getting ready to get really close i
[1:46:11] want
[1:46:12] i want i want to visit something that
[1:46:14] brother branham
[1:46:15] went through
[1:46:16] listen remember i can't teach you
[1:46:18] anything
[1:46:19] brother stephen he can't teach
[1:46:22] he said well
[1:46:24] bless god he's a good teacher i believe
[1:46:26] that he is but
[1:46:27] but but it's not a man's ability to
[1:46:29] teach anything
[1:46:31] because if a man would teach us we would
[1:46:33] get precept upon precept lying upon line
[1:46:36] we'd learn how to be a christian
[1:46:43] so we don't want we don't want to learn
[1:46:45] to be a christian
[1:46:49] but brother brethren one time he
[1:46:51] he told the lord he said you know lord
[1:46:52] he said if if you
[1:46:54] if if the meetings don't don't pay the
[1:46:56] bills i'm getting off the field
[1:47:00] and so he gets to the meetings and all
[1:47:02] of a sudden he's in debt five thousand
[1:47:04] ten thousand
[1:47:06] and he says that's it lord i'm i'm going
[1:47:08] off and i'm going i'll tell media and
[1:47:09] them on the way home
[1:47:11] and so he gets in the car he's coming
[1:47:12] out of california and he's going he said
[1:47:13] okay i'll tell him when we get over into
[1:47:15] arizona
[1:47:17] then tell him he said i'll tell him when
[1:47:18] i get to texas
[1:47:20] because i didn't tell him he said i got
[1:47:22] home finally back into jeffersonville he
[1:47:24] said i finally told him and she said
[1:47:26] honey said you i don't think you're
[1:47:27] doing the right thing
[1:47:29] billy paul told him said dad he said
[1:47:31] that's something you told god god didn't
[1:47:32] tell you that
[1:47:36] so brother branham said well he went out
[1:47:37] and he
[1:47:39] he got down in his bed to pray and
[1:47:41] media was on the other side over there
[1:47:43] praying
[1:47:44] he said in the spirit of the lord began
[1:47:46] to take him into a place he said he saw
[1:47:48] some
[1:47:48] kids come pulling a wagon in
[1:47:51] and he got taken in and and and there
[1:47:54] and this is 1956 being led to the holy
[1:47:57] spirit i want to read a read a little
[1:47:59] portion of it
[1:48:02] because i believe it's god teaching us
[1:48:04] something
[1:48:07] because i believe he taught brother
[1:48:08] branham things
[1:48:12] because brother branham had a lot of
[1:48:13] pentecostal learning in him
[1:48:16] he did he had a lot of pentecostal
[1:48:18] learning
[1:48:19] and it bled through into a lot of things
[1:48:23] he said well now our prophet was perfect
[1:48:24] watch
[1:48:27] and just then brother is talking and he
[1:48:28] says he goes in
[1:48:30] he said just then i went off into
[1:48:31] another dimension
[1:48:33] and when it was now remember watch these
[1:48:35] things
[1:48:37] and he's talking about he it just come
[1:48:39] out of one dimension where he was
[1:48:40] dealing with the baby's shoe and the
[1:48:42] shoestring
[1:48:43] and he had the shoestring and tried to
[1:48:45] push it in and he pushed it and he
[1:48:46] pushed it he couldn't get it and just
[1:48:47] tearing all apart
[1:48:50] and and this voice come to him and said
[1:48:52] you can't teach pentecostal babies super
[1:48:55] natural things
[1:48:58] you can't teach pentecostal babies
[1:49:00] supernatural things
[1:49:04] but brother branham was always trying to
[1:49:05] teach pentecostal babies
[1:49:07] supernatural things
[1:49:10] and so he goes and he goes and brothers
[1:49:12] i look down i saw well there was that
[1:49:13] little piece of the shoe that was
[1:49:14] supposed to go through
[1:49:16] and just then he said sing went like
[1:49:18] another dimension now remember watch
[1:49:20] these things they'll come to pass word
[1:49:22] by word
[1:49:25] i'm not don't worry i'm not preaching
[1:49:27] tent vision
[1:49:29] okay and if you believe that's fine but
[1:49:31] i don't put my idea to it
[1:49:35] so listen watch these things that'll
[1:49:36] come to pass word by word it's perfect
[1:49:41] paul said when that which is perfect has
[1:49:42] come
[1:49:48] hey
[1:49:49] this is the way he teaches me
[1:49:52] [Laughter]
[1:49:57] okay what now and i was standing by a
[1:50:00] lake look like
[1:50:02] and he'd taken me and set me down there
[1:50:04] by this lake and brother brandon says
[1:50:05] over in a what is the vision he says
[1:50:07] here it was he said i was by this big
[1:50:08] beautiful lake and he said there was
[1:50:10] rainbow trouts all in there
[1:50:13] i don't know if y'all remember but the
[1:50:15] prophet had a
[1:50:17] big rainbow trout world record i might
[1:50:19] say
[1:50:20] hanging on this wall
[1:50:23] it just happened i don't know how
[1:50:26] good
[1:50:27] i mean it's probably his ability to fish
[1:50:32] see how silly humans are we can we can't
[1:50:35] see god half the time because we're so
[1:50:37] enamored with ourself
[1:50:40] i i did that
[1:50:42] i did watch but what
[1:50:46] he said there was i stand in my lake
[1:50:48] look like and he take me and set me down
[1:50:49] there by this lake
[1:50:51] and he said there was lots of ministers
[1:50:52] around fishing
[1:50:57] now god set brother branham down right
[1:50:59] amongst this big fishing hole
[1:51:01] and there was a bunch of ministers
[1:51:02] fishing
[1:51:04] a bunch of them fishing so here comes
[1:51:06] one and sets in the middle of all these
[1:51:10] might have been a million and he was one
[1:51:12] i don't know how many there was but
[1:51:14] there was a lot
[1:51:15] and i looked and there were great big
[1:51:18] fish and that's where he's talking about
[1:51:19] the rainbow trout and some of them was
[1:51:21] catching little bitty fish
[1:51:24] some of them was catching up and just
[1:51:26] then i said oh my i said i'm a fisherman
[1:51:29] i'll catch
[1:51:30] the fish
[1:51:32] so i picked up the pole that was laying
[1:51:33] on the ground and just then this one
[1:51:35] said to me said i'll teach you to fish
[1:51:44] 1956 programs telling this vision
[1:51:48] the time that america was going to give
[1:51:50] her sin or dad great grace away
[1:51:54] but he's coming and said i'm going to
[1:51:55] teach you so listen
[1:51:58] something's
[1:51:59] something's going to let loose because
[1:52:02] god's going to teach somebody to fish
[1:52:06] something is changing god's going to
[1:52:07] teach somebody how to fish
[1:52:11] so i picked up the pole laying there he
[1:52:13] said i want to
[1:52:15] he said this one said i'll teach you to
[1:52:16] fish the one that had been talking
[1:52:18] behind me to my right side and i said
[1:52:21] all right
[1:52:23] he said fasten on the lure
[1:52:26] but throw it way out in the deep
[1:52:30] throw it way out in the day
[1:52:33] brother said several times he said throw
[1:52:34] it out into deep
[1:52:36] he said and when i went and i went way
[1:52:38] out in the deep he said now when you do
[1:52:42] let your bait settle down
[1:52:46] he said and then pull slow first
[1:52:48] pull slow fair he said the small fish
[1:52:51] will follow the lure
[1:52:56] there was people that followed brother
[1:52:57] branham all over this country
[1:53:02] people
[1:53:02] followed him everywhere
[1:53:04] we got people to follow preachers all
[1:53:06] over this message now
[1:53:12] ain't a lot of people following god but
[1:53:14] they'll follow a man
[1:53:16] all over the place
[1:53:18] watch and he said
[1:53:20] he said now what dude
[1:53:22] he said small fish will follow the lord
[1:53:24] now that's really fish and technique all
[1:53:25] right he said pull slow and said the
[1:53:28] small fish will follow
[1:53:30] and then you'll get a when you get a
[1:53:31] strike he said just jerk it a little bit
[1:53:33] not hard
[1:53:34] a little bit not art
[1:53:36] but i said don't tell nobody how you're
[1:53:39] doing it
[1:53:48] now i would have to argue with the angel
[1:53:50] right here
[1:53:53] you said what are you talking about
[1:53:54] jesus told me go you in all the world
[1:53:56] and preach the gospel teaching them
[1:53:59] [Music]
[1:54:03] looks like we got contradiction
[1:54:08] not if you're under the hand of god and
[1:54:09] he's teaching he's going to show you
[1:54:11] these things
[1:54:13] see
[1:54:14] remember
[1:54:16] jesus message won't work today
[1:54:27] listen
[1:54:28] brother stephen invited me everybody
[1:54:30] said by the way the lord now listen i'm
[1:54:31] not gonna do anything to hurt brother
[1:54:33] stephen or his church
[1:54:37] and i believe everything jesus said
[1:54:41] and i'm not taking and making nothing
[1:54:43] of none effect
[1:54:44] but sometimes our traditions will
[1:54:48] sometimes our traditions will
[1:54:50] and that's why god will break our
[1:54:52] traditions
[1:54:53] now that's really fierce he said let's
[1:54:54] just jerk a little bit and i'll harvest
[1:54:56] it don't tell nobody how you're doing
[1:54:57] say keep it still don't tell nobody what
[1:55:00] you're doing said pull it slow
[1:55:03] you know he told he told the disciples
[1:55:05] one time coming off mountain
[1:55:06] transfiguration tell no man
[1:55:09] because some things ain't for them
[1:55:13] amen god said keep still don't tell
[1:55:15] nobody what you're doing pull it slow
[1:55:16] and then and when you feel your strike
[1:55:19] just pull your bait far enough
[1:55:22] to scatter the little fish
[1:55:26] you mean you're gonna scatter them
[1:55:28] little clingy things that been hanging
[1:55:30] on around here that really ain't got it
[1:55:32] them little fish you're gonna run them
[1:55:34] little fish off don't run nobody no he
[1:55:36] said pull it until they scatter
[1:55:39] sometimes i'll have me say things
[1:55:41] that'll make some leap
[1:55:46] son ago but he said some will ponder
[1:55:50] some ponder
[1:55:52] glory
[1:55:55] this message ain't a message of a man
[1:55:57] this is the message and the workings of
[1:55:59] god
[1:56:00] he knows what he's doing saints he's got
[1:56:03] a bride on his mind and he's got a place
[1:56:06] for
[1:56:08] glory watch

[1:56:19] run for it
[1:56:21] who am i going to teach
[1:56:23] make them run for it
[1:56:25] oh then when you get a strike then you
[1:56:27] set your hook for the catch
[1:56:29] and i said i understand
[1:56:36] now this is the prophet of god saying i
[1:56:37] understand
[1:56:39] and i threw it way out
[1:56:42] just as i did
[1:56:44] all these ministers and people run
[1:56:46] around
[1:56:48] oh brother branham's back on the field

[1:57:49] i felt real big about because they were
[1:57:51] telling me i was a fisherman
[1:57:54] every person is susceptible to that
[1:57:57] [Laughter]
[1:58:00] a man don't become popular by itself
[1:58:02] [Music]
[1:58:04] a lot of little ministers get around and
[1:58:05] pump him up and and if he ain't got god
[1:58:08] to keep him humble
[1:58:10] he'll ride around and gather up and take
[1:58:12] off and go and fly and do whatever to
[1:58:14] satisfy those people
[1:58:17] his messes will begin to satisfy those
[1:58:19] people
[1:58:22] and then god's message will be for god
[1:58:25] oh but he'll still have quotes he'll
[1:58:27] still have scripture
[1:58:29] but the message
[1:58:31] won't be
[1:58:32] ringing watch and brother branham now
[1:58:35] watch this is a brother adam watch he's
[1:58:36] teaching us
[1:58:38] and all these ministry people run around
[1:58:39] praise little brother and really catch
[1:58:40] fish they was just going home oh my i
[1:58:42] thought i was somebody telling me i was
[1:58:44] a fisherman i said now i'll tell you how
[1:58:46] it's done here's the way you do it and i
[1:58:49] said the first you're supposed to pull
[1:58:51] slow and then when the little fish goes
[1:58:53] to follow i said you said it like this
[1:58:56] he got so excited about that first pull
[1:58:58] again he just couldn't let go of that
[1:59:00] first pull
[1:59:05] oh come on
[1:59:07] he couldn't let go of that first pull
[1:59:13] he couldn't oh wait
[1:59:16] watch
[1:59:17] there you go
[1:59:19] he said you said it like that this and
[1:59:21] when i did i jerked bait hooking
[1:59:23] everything out of the water and i looked
[1:59:24] and i caught a fish but i was wondering
[1:59:26] how i ever got the lure in his mouth
[1:59:29] cause it looked like just the skin of
[1:59:30] the fish stretched around the lower it
[1:59:32] was such a little fish and just then i
[1:59:34] said oh my look
[1:59:39] and just then
[1:59:41] this one had been talking behind me
[1:59:42] stepped around in front of me it was the
[1:59:45] same angel of god that's always spoke to
[1:59:48] me
[1:59:49] he said you've done just what i told you
[1:59:52] not to do standing on the platform and
[1:59:55] trying to explain it and telling the
[1:59:57] people and i told you to keep it to
[1:59:59] yourself
[2:00:01] now brother brennaman before this said
[2:00:03] all this is going to come to pass
[2:00:05] perfect
[2:00:08] this was 1956 when he got the vision he
[2:00:10] didn't know what was coming
[2:00:14] the third pool wasn't there yet
[2:00:18] but
[2:00:20] my
[2:00:22] my
[2:00:24] saints what
[2:00:25] what did we see it
[2:00:27] that brother branham himself as a person
[2:00:29] would come and he wouldn't let go of
[2:00:31] that first pull he kept bringing it with
[2:00:33] him trying to explain it to the people
[2:00:38] and if we get down to the end and the
[2:00:39] angel is standing there when it's all
[2:00:41] done now and he says you did what i
[2:00:43] exactly what i told you not to do
[2:00:52] and then you wonder why the little fish
[2:00:53] left
[2:00:55] glory god knows what he's doing
[2:01:00] glory
[2:01:02] brother brahman didn't do it his own
[2:01:03] self god knows what brother branham was
[2:01:05] and what do you
[2:01:06] do glory
[2:01:10] you think oh brother brown was messing
[2:01:12] it all up
[2:01:14] glory
[2:01:17] god didn't have his eye on the little
[2:01:18] fish he had his own the big fish
[2:01:24] right isaiah 43 said i will give men for
[2:01:28] your sake
[2:01:29] he'll make brother branham do exactly
[2:01:31] what i told you not to do so that we
[2:01:33] would do exactly what he said to do
[2:01:36] glory
[2:01:42] yes i don't understand that goes against
[2:01:43] my tradition
[2:01:45] praise god
[2:01:46] his ways are higher than our ways
[2:01:50] amen
[2:01:52] hey listen he sent a man
[2:01:54] all the way on a boat to tarsus in the
[2:01:57] perfect will of god the prophet said in
[2:01:59] the perfect will of god just to get him
[2:02:01] to have a rendezvous with a fish that he
[2:02:03] had specially prepared amen to deliver
[2:02:05] him out to a place that was going to
[2:02:07] catch a big fish
[2:02:09] come on saints oh we got it wrong a lot
[2:02:11] of times we think there's a we think we
[2:02:13] got a cookie cutter religion and
[2:02:15] everybody's going to fit in there but
[2:02:17] god is the god of
[2:02:18] [Music]
[2:02:20] oh my saints
[2:02:22] this message is praying perfect in the
[2:02:24] hand of almighty god and it's doing what

[2:02:31] that sees it i'm glad there's a people
[2:02:33] that can understand it
[2:02:36] glory

[2:02:44] yourself sin and now this is what i want
[2:02:46] you to see and said look what you've
[2:02:49] done
[2:02:51] look at the carnal impersonators nations
[2:02:54] you got
[2:02:57] you got rosie
[2:02:59] what did he do what did all that show us
[2:03:01] it showed us that there was a lot of
[2:03:03] people that was going to watch brother
[2:03:04] branham and do just what brother branham
[2:03:06] did
[2:03:08] they was going to line up and have
[2:03:09] prayer lines like brother branham did
[2:03:11] they was going to have big meetings like
[2:03:12] brother branham did they was gonna try
[2:03:14] to discern like brother branham did they
[2:03:16] was gonna carry their bibles like
[2:03:17] brother brenham did they was gonna have
[2:03:19] church like brother branham did they
[2:03:20] were gonna do everything like brother
[2:03:22] brenham did but yet they were mimics
[2:03:24] impersonators and here we are in this
[2:03:26] hour with a bunch of impersonators
[2:03:30] doing just what the prophet did trying
[2:03:32] to act and have church
[2:03:34] and denying the very power of god from
[2:03:38] such turn away
[2:03:40] oh my god is going to break everything
[2:03:42] down in this hour he's going to run out
[2:03:44] every little fish
[2:03:47] he said what are you talking about
[2:03:49] mimicking the way that he fished
[2:03:56] brother brown talked about casting a net
[2:03:57] and dragging in the fish and where'd he
[2:03:59] get that he got that from jesus what did
[2:04:00] jesus say cast out there in the deep and
[2:04:02] bring him in and he told the story about
[2:04:04] casting out there bringing in all the
[2:04:05] pollywogs bringing in everything else
[2:04:08] why because they were going to build a
[2:04:09] church
[2:04:13] trying to build a church
[2:04:17] and now i say in this hour i said we're
[2:04:19] not to throw a net and try to build a
[2:04:21] church but we've had special god-sent
[2:04:24] instruction
[2:04:25] how to he said i'll teach you how to
[2:04:27] fish
[2:04:29] and what are we supposed to be fishing
[2:04:31] for
[2:04:32] we're not supposed to be fishing for
[2:04:34] church full of pentecostal babies
[2:04:37] we're not supposed to be trying to make
[2:04:38] a bunch of pentecostal babies i mean
[2:04:40] they gotta suck milk
[2:04:42] but what do we do we are fishing
[2:04:45] with a special lure
[2:04:47] into a deep pool
[2:04:49] amen where very few are
[2:04:51] anybody can catch little fish anybody
[2:04:54] can get an altar full oh my but the
[2:04:56] supernatural power of almighty god is
[2:04:59] the only one that can catch a bride in
[2:05:01] this hour
[2:05:04] oh my but if everybody wants to keep
[2:05:06] fishing like they always fist they'll
[2:05:08] keep catching what they always count oh
[2:05:11] mama brad it's time that we stand and
[2:05:14] feel it's like we were taught

[2:05:31] down in the first but it doesn't work
[2:05:34] today you say well we keep doing it we
[2:05:35] keep getting church members and that's
[2:05:37] all we keep getting
[2:05:42] persuading people

[2:06:03] and you might only get one
[2:06:05] oh but it's going to be the real one
[2:06:09] you might scatter a bunch of little fish
[2:06:10] while you're fishing for it

[2:08:52] why would you go back to the
[2:08:54] tables that are full of vomit you come
[2:08:56] out of
[2:08:58] when god has stood in this hour and
[2:09:00] taught us how to fish
[2:09:02] now i'm not making a doctrine of that
[2:09:04] but i'm just saying in everything
[2:09:07] when god brings us out of something
[2:09:08] let's not go back and keep doing the
[2:09:10] same old same old
[2:09:14] listen he said that bride
[2:09:17] his wife hath made herself ready he said
[2:09:20] behold the marriage of the lamb is come
[2:09:26] when did we get married
[2:09:29] visible union
[2:09:34] why are we still acting like some
[2:09:36] engaged woman
[2:09:40] come on does an engaged lady act like a
[2:09:43] married woman
[2:09:48] [Music]
[2:09:54] let me ask you another one see god knows
[2:09:56] answers to all this
[2:09:57] he knows he said well i find faith when
[2:09:59] i return
[2:10:04] he did
[2:10:06] he did bro stephen he knew he would
[2:10:09] he wasn't hoping somebody would believe
[2:10:11] him
[2:10:12] he looked down brother instead of seven
[2:10:14] says he said here we were they
[2:10:15] predestinated for this age
[2:10:22] yes ezekiel can these bones live
[2:10:25] lord thou knowest
[2:10:26] he asked abraham is there anything too
[2:10:28] hard for the lord
[2:10:31] see god knows the answer
[2:10:33] because he is the answer
[2:10:35] he is the answer
[2:10:38] when over rebecca turned to eliezer
[2:10:41] said eliezer
[2:10:43] who is that
[2:10:44] [Music]
[2:10:48] what did she have to do
[2:10:50] she had to leave eliezer
[2:10:52] [Music]
[2:10:54] and then she went to isaac
[2:10:57] and moved in with isaac and went into
[2:10:59] the holiest of holies where i where
[2:11:01] eliezer had never gone before
[2:11:03] see this bride this bride was not
[2:11:06] ordained to copycat and to impersonate
[2:11:08] brother branham's ministry this bride
[2:11:10] was to fulfill brother branham's the
[2:11:12] lord's prophecy
[2:11:14] [Music]
[2:11:16] she is to live what he preached because
[2:11:18] this is the very interpretation of that
[2:11:21] message i don't need some cloud to tell
[2:11:24] me this is true
[2:11:26] for right here is the vindication that
[2:11:29] everything he said is right
[2:11:32] for it says yea and amen
[2:11:35] and it lives in this hour
[2:11:38] i don't need a healing to tell me god's
[2:11:40] alive
[2:11:44] because when i lay down in bed with him
[2:11:46] he tells me his secrets
[2:11:49] glory told me what he meant
[2:11:52] he told me who he is he told me who this
[2:11:55] melchizedek was
[2:11:57] [Music]
[2:12:03] that's what he's done to this little
[2:12:04] bride
[2:12:05] [Music]

[2:13:12] religion
[2:13:14] oh god she's not satisfied with little
[2:13:16] fish
[2:13:17] she's not satisfied god with
[2:13:20] what it was
[2:13:21] or what it might be
[2:13:23] because she's fell in love
[2:13:25] with what it is
[2:13:26] [Music]

[2:13:30] never

[2:14:27] and what he'd be telling them it's not
[2:14:29] his thoughts but god would be your
[2:14:31] thoughts and then god did see it
[2:14:33] manifest out in their life and god
[2:14:35] didn't know it's not some vindication of
[2:14:37] a of some miracle father but it's a it's
[2:14:40] a vindication of your word being made
[2:14:42] manifest

[2:16:43] how many let me see your hand
[2:16:46] how many understood how the fishing
[2:16:49] did you see the three pools there
[2:16:52] did you see them
[2:16:56] it's in church how could they have asked
[2:16:57] you a question to verify
[2:17:00] amen
[2:17:01] but all three pools were laying in that
[2:17:03] vision
[2:17:04] amen
[2:17:05] the first because the rainbow trap
[2:17:08] sometimes is under destruction
[2:17:12] he's probably doing certain things
[2:17:14] amen so when the bait is launched
[2:17:18] he's not really looking at the at the
[2:17:20] at the bait
[2:17:22] it's like moses
[2:17:23] hurting the ship
[2:17:25] so they got to do a supernatural
[2:17:28] so moses can turn around
[2:17:30] and say what is this
[2:17:32] that's the first spoon
[2:17:34] everybody okay
[2:17:36] everybody okay so that rainbow could be
[2:17:38] doing certain things under the under the
[2:17:41] pond and doesn't see the hook
[2:17:43] so they tall brother branham go ahead
[2:17:45] and launch that
[2:17:47] when you drop deep
[2:17:49] you pull it the first time
[2:17:51] when you pull it the little bitty bird
[2:17:53] will see that
[2:17:54] and they will go after it
[2:17:56] everybody care when they begin to go
[2:17:59] after it that's the first pool
[2:18:01] that's the healing everybody okay
[2:18:04] when they begin to come
[2:18:05] then the one who was under destruction
[2:18:08] the one who god was really looking for
[2:18:11] will see the movement
[2:18:14] of the water vibrating
[2:18:16] and when he turn he will see little
[2:18:18] fishes following something
[2:18:23] is it clear now
[2:18:25] i thought you told me you know
[2:18:29] you want me to continue or you want to
[2:18:31] go home
[2:18:33] you want me to finish it
[2:18:36] did i lose somebody you want me to
[2:18:38] repeat it
[2:18:41] you want me to repeat it
[2:18:44] continue
[2:18:45] okay so that speech was under
[2:18:47] destruction
[2:18:49] so when the little fish begin to move
[2:18:52] quickly there is like a
[2:18:55] a current like uh like a vibration that
[2:18:58] comes back so the big fish who was
[2:19:01] uh looking at something maybe on
[2:19:03] facebook or whatever they were doing
[2:19:06] suddenly hear something like where is
[2:19:09] everybody going
[2:19:10] everybody okay
[2:19:12] then that fish turn
[2:19:13] and he knows if the little fishes are
[2:19:16] going like this they got to be a food
[2:19:18] somewhere
[2:19:19] but here then he jump on there and begin
[2:19:22] to follow them
[2:19:24] right
[2:19:25] so if brother branham pulls quickly if
[2:19:28] you pull quickly you catch the little
[2:19:30] one
[2:19:30] that's not what god is looking for
[2:19:33] anybody here so you gotta take the
[2:19:36] little one and you gotta scatter them
[2:19:38] so they make way for debate to face the
[2:19:42] big one
[2:19:47] you see your prophet just put it there
[2:19:49] and left
[2:19:50] everybody here
[2:19:51] so what do you do you pull the second
[2:19:54] time
[2:19:54] when you pull the second time the load
[2:19:57] of fish now lose gps
[2:20:00] everybody here that's when the message
[2:20:03] get hard
[2:20:04] but here that's when brother branham
[2:20:06] begin to rebuke the nomination coming
[2:20:09] under the second seal i mean under the
[2:20:12] second pull and the discernment and from
[2:20:14] there on the teaching comes in 62 and
[2:20:17] begin to destroy everything uh why am i
[2:20:21] against organized religion who is this
[2:20:23] jesus jezebel with all of that when he
[2:20:26] does that then brother branham is no
[2:20:28] more a good man
[2:20:29] it is the second paul
[2:20:31] we thought he was good for healing for
[2:20:33] all this kind of stuff but the message
[2:20:36] began to get tired tight a little bit
[2:20:38] tighter then some people begin to leave
[2:20:40] the church
[2:20:45] don't worry it's god's scattering
[2:20:47] the small fishes
[2:20:49] no no you can talk to that fish from
[2:20:52] morning to evening
[2:20:54] he will not stay
[2:20:56] you can give him 1100 coats
[2:20:59] that fish will move out
[2:21:01] because he's not meant for that catch
[2:21:04] and god doesn't look for him anybody
[2:21:07] care when the second pool comes he
[2:21:09] opened the way once he opened the way
[2:21:13] now the big fish is now facing
[2:21:16] the lord the lord that is coming up this
[2:21:18] way
[2:21:19] that's what god was crying that's why
[2:21:21] brother branham the angel told him now
[2:21:23] set ready
[2:21:25] and then for the catch
[2:21:27] and then after that the angels stop
[2:21:31] because the pool to catch
[2:21:34] is a supernatural action
[2:21:36] they cannot explain it to you
[2:21:38] if they explain it to you you're going
[2:21:39] to give the holy ghost to everybody
[2:21:43] the way you pull it you don't explain it
[2:21:46] you will just feel like i need to pull
[2:21:48] and suddenly the fish is out
[2:21:50] that's a supernatural you don't explain
[2:21:52] it it just come
[2:21:54] automatically because they cannot
[2:21:56] explain it to if they give you that
[2:21:58] secret the devil knows
[2:22:00] the secret of life
[2:22:02] you cannot give it to the devil so the
[2:22:04] lord stop right there and keep the third
[2:22:06] pool quiet because when he comes and
[2:22:09] brother branham when he got excited he
[2:22:11] pulled and got the wrong one
[2:22:16] he was a little bit efficient like this
[2:22:19] amen that was not what he was meant
[2:22:22] after a while he would go to mama where
[2:22:24] he came from
[2:22:25] so many people can follow the message
[2:22:28] they can follow the first poll
[2:22:30] the second poll
[2:22:32] the problem is get in here
[2:22:37] everybody here once that hook get to the
[2:22:40] fish
[2:22:41] and that rainbow trout has a rainbow
[2:22:45] many colors which means a it's a
[2:22:47] covenant it's a fish that before god
[2:22:50] come to search it you already have a
[2:22:52] covenant
[2:22:56] amen so there is already a sign in your
[2:22:59] life before even god come to look for
[2:23:01] you
[2:23:02] you are just in sin
[2:23:04] but while you were yet sinners
[2:23:06] christ already died for you
[2:23:09] so now he's looking he knows exactly
[2:23:11] where he's going he's just playing
[2:23:13] around before you know it don't that's
[2:23:14] why it's an individual walk
[2:23:17] don't look at the move of other people
[2:23:19] oh we're going this way we're going this
[2:23:21] way be careful when they shake the boat
[2:23:24] watch the door that is opening it is a
[2:23:27] bait and you only hook roof
[2:23:29] and pull roof out
[2:23:32] back here and the sky the orpah
[2:23:36] is he okay now
[2:23:38] you got it now
[2:23:40] leave the intellectual level
[2:23:43] get into the reality
[2:23:44] how many times have i say this is not a
[2:23:47] continuation
[2:23:48] this is not about a church
[2:23:50] it is about you and god and your
[2:23:53] preparation going to heaven that's
[2:23:56] exactly what the brother preached he was
[2:23:58] not even here when we preach about it
[2:24:00] anybody care anybody care it is all
[2:24:03] about you and god your individual affair
[2:24:06] amen because if you don't pay attention
[2:24:08] you stay in this message and you already
[2:24:10] under a denominational spirit and you
[2:24:13] after preachers
[2:24:15] you have to minister pull here pull here
[2:24:18] until you are confused
[2:24:21] everybody care
[2:24:22] stay put the lord
[2:24:24] knows what he started and what he
[2:24:27] started he would take it all the way to
[2:24:29] the end brother
[2:24:31] wonderful message we will enjoy it
[2:24:38] amen
[2:24:40] so stay in prayer we got question and
[2:24:42] answer on saturday at 2 30 and keep
[2:24:45] praying keep uh consecrating and lord's
[2:24:48] willing if he doesn't come back yet we
[2:24:51] meet again on sunday morning
[2:24:53] ready to climb up again high amen amen
[2:24:57] remember his language tonight
[2:24:59] he's not going to make it easy sometimes
[2:25:01] he takes you to the wilderness that's
[2:25:03] where he talks to you that's why he's
[2:25:05] rocking the boat
[2:25:06] not telling you that you're not
[2:25:08] christian you gotta wake up
[2:25:10] it's all going time
[2:25:13] no more playing church amen
[2:25:16] amen if the people in the message don't
[2:25:18] wake up very soon some will be in total
[2:25:22] lost
[2:25:23] because we have been playing church a
[2:25:25] long time
[2:25:26] we got comfortable
[2:25:27] amen that's why deception are coming
[2:25:30] left and right
[2:25:31] so that you can be anchored to christ
[2:25:34] and you know if mama left i'm not
[2:25:36] leaving if daddy leave i'm not gonna
[2:25:39] leave him not if my family leave the
[2:25:41] message i leave the message all of you

[2:25:48] you

[2:26:08] holy spirit using a vessel in a powerful
[2:26:12] way
