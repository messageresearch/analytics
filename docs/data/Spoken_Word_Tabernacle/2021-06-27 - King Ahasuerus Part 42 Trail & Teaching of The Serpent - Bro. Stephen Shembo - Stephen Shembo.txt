the key hallelujah [Laughter] praise the lord brother greg is your uh testimony uh is it a good it's like a praise report or what is it like yeah well come on up with it then then you can hang out up here and pray over the uh prayer requests amen praise the lord did anybody else have any prayer any praise reports yes okay okay yeah we'll get with that we'll get to that in just a minute amen anybody else with the praise report all right amen all right well i got a couple little things um i went to the meetings up there at brother josh's and um was it thursday night getting ready to leave i was sitting in my truck i looked over there across the parking lot and i thought i recognized this young fella and i thought about him often and he come walking over the truck and we started talk we talked for about an hour there in the parking lot but it was brother manuel walker and it really blessed my heart to see him that he has come out of that and that was it just really blessed me to see him there because i often wondered what happened to him the other thing you got that picture brother see this right here remember last time brother tim was here and preached for us and brother stephen at the end of the service in his prayer he prayed to for god to give this brother the desire of his heart and while he was praying that i was sitting back here and it struck me that god's going to give them a child okay and i told him and his wife about it after service that night well i think it was friday night at the service up there i come out he's sitting in the foyer there with this little girl [Laughter] and now they didn't have this little girl but they have a very very good chance of adopting it and it comes out of a family member somewhere along the line and i told him i said brother i said what brother stephen prayed that night and the thought the lord gave me this is a thought expressed you know and it was just wonderful um and this here is on a personal note and i just feel led to speak this because i want to say it publicly and i believe we're in the age of the spoken word that whatever comes out of our mouths the lord is going to manifest it i believe that wholeheartedly if you read the message why christ speak brother branham types it out when moses came to the red sea lord i told you you're going to bring those people back to this mountain and you all are going to worship me here the red sea's in the way what's the problem you know same thing with uh samson and i'm sending this to my daughter okay she's still over there in that babylon her and my son-in-law and savannah i'm sending the spoken word after you it's going to get you out of there and i just want to make this public that is coming for you one way or the other it's going to get you and you're coming out of that mess so i just wanted to put that out there and make it public so the devil knows what's coming amen [Laughter] amen yes ma'am her daughter is getting married and because of life choices as we know um there is a real big issue like he did in your heart this morning i believe her mom will be at the wedding and i wanted to be a testament to the lord so i'm just asking you to pray for that family because it's a lot of people hurt because of that the young people want to do what is right in the sight of god but there's other things that the enemy is trying to prevent i told her it is a union this you're making a union with god regardless of what you've done before that's what he's all about is that union between us and so the enemy doesn't want that to happen so trust the lord seek his face and he will step in so i just want you to pray for that family he knows it all amen as believers we have to stand in the gap for those who are not okay her family right okay um brother robert sent one this morning um for brother patrick he's in uganda he says um we are back to lock down for the next 42 days over there pray for us and um some countries are like that still my wife's country has an eight o'clock curfew they can't leave the house until i mean after eight they have to have masks on a hundred percent so she'll be coming home um the seventh which is a week from tuesday but i'll bring that up next sunday anybody else have a prayer request this morning yes sir okay dicky williams okay okay amen all right everybody good then amen i'm gonna let brother greg pray over these real quick father we just come before you another day lord that we have gathered here under the banner of your name lord and under the banner of this end time word father lord we

stephen lord and lord may we hear your words but father may you hear through us father let it let us not hear through human ears but let us hear through your ears father what you are saying to us and father sister bridgenette's uh request there with that situation father lord we we know we all have things on our heart for loved ones and family members father but lord as i said earlier let the spoken word go from this little room here as it went that day when that brother's car was stolen and brother branham and the brothers got down and prayed lord and the holy spirit went out from where they were at and went down the road and followed that car until i got to that car and and got on that man's heart and he turned the car around and brought it back lord we speak this father we speak the word from this little place lord and let it go out to the to the requests that were made and go down the road as it were and find a resting place lord in those requests father and turn the hearts around lord we believe it we speak it lord according to this revelation that you've given to us and i it reminds me of what brother branham said he said i'm not going to speak it in his name anymore but i'm going to speak it according to my revelation and lord that's what we're doing we're speaking it lord according to our revelation because that word cannot return to you void and father we just commit the service into your hands lord have your will and way father and everything that's said and done bless us lord and as we leave here let us say that our not heart did not our hearts burn

the lord hallelujah you might be seated a minute just a reminder i believe brother john you already did it for building funds everybody got that clear if you want to sing in the choir you want to praise the lord use your beautiful voice for the lord go ahead and see brother john porter after church amen yeah you say beautiful voice yes maybe it's not beautiful for you might be sweet for the lord make a joyful water that's good enough make a joyful nose that's good enough so just a reminder we have a building fund going on i believe brother david sent couple messages this morning about the building we on youtube we on streaming there are some information we cannot put up on youtube because of the privacy of the church so you should receive two pictures and you should receive a message telling you about the progress of the church if we were in a house meeting i would have given you more detail but you're more than welcome if you want to see the progress of the church whenever your brother robert is there monday through uh friday probably sometime saturday you can just stop by and you can see how the church look amen yeah i don't want to say it they're going to see it on the uh on the pulpit i have been monitoring youtube and i saw there are few guys keep following and putting sticking their thumbs down so i know they don't want to give up amen but one of these days they're going to get converted brother branham say you can speed and the police officer don't get you brother branham said but judgment will catch you one day amen so i seen them keep following keep following these two things if you don't believe this message i clearly stated don't follow me i am not going to change amen in this church the bible says brother branham say the bible says brother branham said it's not going to change we pure we we preach here the pure message of the hour just the way he was delivered whether i understand it or not i'm just going to repeat what the prophet says amen [Applause] so if you don't like it don't get in my channel don't follow the channel you're just wasting your time amen it's better for you to face god differently than to face god putting thumbs down on his word amen yeah you better met him on your sinful condition than attacking his word amen yes brother michael you want to say something i beg your pardon yes sir so you heard it man i just don't want to tell them on youtube if you would like you can talk to brother david he can send that message just to tell the church what is exactly going on if i say it here they're going to catch it and i don't want to tell them the secret belong to the praise be the name of the lord we have two graduates brother joshua camuto and brother angelo kadima right so i'm going to start with brother george you're already sitting on the front so you can come up and get your bible as a congratulation from the church and from your pastor thank you very much god bless you congratulations brother amen blessed be the name of the lord so if you want to get your bible make sure you graduate [Laughter] amen you want to quote about uh going to school see me i have plenty of them come on brother angelo congratulations that's a beautiful bible amen thank you very much keep up the good work amen you don't know how many people jump out of school until you see the statistic then you will understand so when i see young men progressing like this that's better brother branham say it make life a little bit easier so we want you to make life a little bit easier for the oncoming sisters amen we don't want you to get her pregnant going to work [Applause] amen amen i want them to relax and enjoy your paycheck i already preached on that right i want the sister to stay home and enjoy their paycheck they enjoy your money they enjoy everything buddy you win a tough church for the message man yeah we're gonna go back to the old foundation before we start i'm gonna mention something here because i'm on youtube if i was on the house meeting i would have spoken a little bit different but in this church we don't believe in makeup amen we don't believe in makeup in this church amen we do not believe in makeup already preach on it amen we don't believe in women cutting their hair i already preach on them and are demonstrated by the scripture and by the bible and but brother branham say if a woman doesn't have long hair right she can take a wig and put it there amen the only thing we want to see through your hair is to make sure things look so what natural amen if you have dark hair don't put blue air anybody clear if your hair is brown don't bring red hair amen you can put your hair make sure it looks water natural if you want to put a wig on make sure your wig looks water you don't want to have a wig that have the hair that has been trimmed it gives a wrong information amen brother branham say if you don't have nail you can put nail but not that you have nell and you add another nail brother one of them say if you don't have teeth [Music] you cannot put some teeth i gave you the coat it's on youtube anybody clear anybody clear so far amen so when somebody look at your hair and they say it looks beautiful it looks like your hair until men have a confusion to tell whether it's your hair or it's not your hair so you know you perfectly in line with god a man amen so as far as the skin some people have trouble with the skin some women have trouble with their skin anybody clear and brother branham gave us the leverage to work with number one you need to check the motive of your heart anybody clear anybody clear so far and then it is normal to cover the imperfection of your skin keeping in line with your tone anybody here do you hear me in other words you cannot be black and when you cover your imperfection you look white now you are insulting god who made you black everybody you cannot be white and then your covering of the imperfection make you look black that is contrary to the word so if you want to cover that load of that that is right here make sure whatever you use for your covering matches your tone because when you put it a little bit thicker he might give an impression of a makeup but it's not actually a makeup it was just a covering of the imperfection anybody clear i hope you got your answers everybody got the answers anybody got their answer you got a problem some people some sister have a little some i don't want to call it you know what it is on their skin they can use a lot of something make it look natural and line up with your tone so when everybody sees you they know you're already light skinned and they can't tell whether it's you or whether it's somebody else anybody clear so far but we don't want to move from black all the way to white or from white all the way to red then it's a different story anybody clear so far anybody cares so far that's why paul timothy had a problem with his tummy okay you got it now you got it now and timotec keep drinking water water water and the constipation was not helping and we know that as a believer we don't drink wine you know that but paul told timothy he said timothy stop drinking water use a little bit of water for your water not want to test the good wine but one for indigestion everybody clear so far so as a general rule we don't believe in makeup but people have problem with their skin with their tone and as a woman brother branham said there is something about a woman that wants to make herself beautiful anybody clear and i want it to be a training to this church if you see something wrong with somebody don't talk about it anybody care young people if you see something wrong with somebody don't get in the group and begin to talk about it you go straight to that person and you pull that person aside and you talk to her as a brother or as a sister everybody cleared so far and when you talk to them you must keep respect with you because paul told timothy rebuke not an elder clear when you're talking to an elder paul told timothy you talk to him as a father if it's an elder woman you talk to her as a mother if it's a younger sister you talk to her as your sister it's in the scripture everybody clear and if it's a younger brother you talk to them as a younger brother you are not there to scream on people to hush them or to disrespect them everybody you see something wrong and somebody want to talk about it push the button you say sister don't talk to me go see that person everybody clear everybody clear you don't sit and talk and then you finish you say we're going to pray about it what are you going to pray about it you already finished the person left and right there is not even blood in their system you squeeze everything that was there everybody clear so far blessed be the name of the lord so just remember that make it a habit if you don't you're going to grow up in your marriage and you find yourself gossiping all the time i seen this in the message all the time that's why me personally i don't believe in young kids sleeping over because of going from houses to houses to houses and picking up what is wrong with this family what is wrong with this family what is wrong with this family what is wrong with this family and before you have it you know a young sister that know all the families how are you going to be a mother to your church to your children how are you going to do it amen young sister talking about this talking and sometimes you hear the stuff that people are talking it's not even equivalent to their age how did they get that parent when talking about it and when parents were talking about it the sister or the younger brother they caught it and before you know it they know what brother showing so deep they know what sister so and so they they know and when they get to their marriage they don't want to perfect themselves because they already know the weakness of everybody anybody clear so far so remember that i believe that is clear you have a question on that you come back and see me if anything have offended anybody you forgive us because paul told us in romans 15 that we make sure that our liberty is not a stumbling block from someone amen sometimes you might do something not with a bad motive but he stumbles somebody else the intent was not to make somebody else stumble but sometimes we gotta watch that liberty and to make sure it doesn't stumble somebody now so we gotta maneuver very good that's why you need wisdom everybody clear so far so praise be the name of the lord the next house meeting will be announced by the deacon and we're going to handle it this coming month this month was so busy and lord's willing i'm going to catch up on the counseling so if you're waiting on me just check on your text message or i'll give you a call and we go ahead and orchestrate everything with the deacon everybody clear so far let's all stand and go to the scripture amen we already talked about respecting the women we don't want to damage that again i hate to see an abused woman she's already a weaker vessel and you take again advantage of her i hate that i can't stand it amen i beat my wife is she your child [Laughter] call me one time when you do that you'll see my reaction and he will teach you not to do that again don't say pastor i'm sorry genesis chapter 2 amen we may need to be protected doesn't mean women need to be arrogant because that just drop so if you're battling with that you need to quit genesis chapter 2 verse 9. sometimes people go through different trials and different pressure of life and you might get an answer that you don't want but it's not really the person they just had a bad day at work and they're just responding by what they have but if you know your wife or your husband or your child you can discern this is not them just give them some time to call off and you're going to find out it's not her she just had a bad day she can't take it anymore genesis chapter 2 verse 9 and out of the ground may the lord god to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight you might be seated and good for food everybody clear we already explained to you that in the garden of eden every single tree that was inside the garden of eden all trees were what good for food everybody clear and pleasant to the eye we already demonstrated to you that anybody clear now the bravo is going to give three categories here karma and good for food the tree of life also in the midst of the garden and the tree of knowledge of good and evil right here we have three categories of of trees we had the remaining trees of the garden amen whether he was apple apricot whatever he was those three were eatable or they were commenstable anybody care and then we have the tree of life everybody clear and then we have the tree of the knowledge of good and evil everybody clear so we have three categories here we have the tree of the knowledge of good and evil we have the tree of life and every other three every other tree was compounded into that set that remained anybody clear these three categories have three lives yes are we okay every single tree in the garden of eden could be eaten everybody care but god separated two trees from the remaining of the tree everybody clear the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil every single tree apart from these two trees could give man natural life in other words men can live with this tree and sustain their life this is what the new testament called bread anybody clear so far the tree of life gave also people life and that life was eternal life everybody and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil gave people life also but that life was called death and brother branham said death is life water perverted everybody so you have three categories of life here you have the natural life that comes by the bread you have the eternal life everybody clear that come from the bread that's why jesus said i am the bread of life that came down from heaven everybody care so these two here men are not lived by water by bread alone but by every water these are the two that god wants you to stay here make sense this you can eat it but it's gonna cause death god do not want you to eat this one we created so far hallelujah job to verse 16 and the lord god command commanded the man saying of every tree of the garden of eden of the garden i'm sorry you may freely eat what god was telling them every tree except this one men shall not live by bread alone but by every word you can do this for your natural life this one is for your spiritual life anybody clear so far he continued he said but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil you shall not eat of it and in the day that you eat thereof you shall surely water there is another life there that is called death but death is a perverted life everybody clears so far jump to verse 25 and they were both water they were naked the men and the woman and were not water so we found out that man in the garden of eden here man was naked and with the nakedness goes the shame everybody clear nakedness is always coupled by shame everybody clear we're getting somewhere in isaiah 47 verse 3 the bible says that nakedness shall be watered uncovered ye the water that shame shall be seen so nakedness is always connected by shame but the problem is god veiled this mystery oh god veil this concept anybody clear that adam and eve could look at one another but the very concept the very mystery of nakedness and shame was removed if we don't get this you won't understand why you need to dress correctly anybody clear and i would take vengeance and i will not meet thee as a man in the book of naom chapter 3 verse 5 the bible says behold i am against this say the lord of hosts and i will discover thy water that skirt upon the face like marilyn monroe you know that picture where she took going up everybody clear and i will show the nation thy nakedness and the kingdom thy water so the nakedness and shame work together that's why the bible says they were naked but they were not what a shame if you have close one of them he automatically will trigger the second one anybody clear in jeremiah chapter 3 verse 3 the bible says therefore the shower have been withholded and there has been known there has been no light rain and that has a water a whole forehead in other words a prostituted face that refuses to be water so when somebody reached the stage of prostitution the shame is removed everybody here so a prostitute have a veil removed everybody clear but when the veil is removed automatically you must be ashamed of something but the prostitute is not a shame the bible says in other words there is another veil that is given to the prostitute that make her not a shame even does she look naked hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord jump to genesis chapter 3 verse 1 verse 3 if you're there you can say amen but of the fruit of the tree which is in the water in the midst of the garden you need to understand the language of the bible what is a gardener song of solomon chapter 5 verse 1 i am come into my water my god and my water and my water now you understand what the gardens means we clear now in first corinthians chapter 3 verse 9 for we are laborers together with god ye the people are god's husbandry in other words you are god's garden you are god's water so a garden spoke about a woman let me go slowly in the midst she about the fruit of the tree which is in the midst so there is a garden but in the midst of the garden you understand now in the midst of the garden god has said you shall not do what eat of it neither shall you water when god spoke this in genesis 2 7 16 god only used the word it god never used the word touching when eve begin to give to the serpent amen rehearse the commandment of god eve added the word touch if was not contradicting god eve was saying the same thing god was speaking in proverbs chapter 30 verse 20 such is the way of an adulterous woman she does water anybody clear you see that eating what it means she eat it and wipe off her mouth and say i have done no water so the eating right here means something else that's what an adulterous woman does because he's committed adultery that is your word eating what about the word touch first corinthians chapter seven verse one now concerning the things whereof you wrote unto me it is good for a man not to do whatever anybody clear that's why eve said you cannot eat of it or need water paul confirmed what eve said and solomon confirmed what eve said they both speaking about the same thing nevertheless to avoid fornication so fornication means what you touching a woman you understand now to avoid fornication let every man have his own wife and let every woman have her own water that's where the touching is permitted that's where the eating is permitted fornication is sexual relationship before marriage adultery is sexual relationship outside of marriage when you are already married ever here one here eating and the other one is water in other words god from the garden of eden was against adultery the word eating and eve added for fornication [Music] god was against adultery and was against water anybody clear okay let's go back now you shall not eat of it neither shall you touch it lest you do water let you die and the serpent said to the woman we already explained you this you shall not surely die hallelujah for god does know everybody clear so far god does know that in the day you eat thereof then your eyes shall be open and you shall be as gods why do you want to be god amen knowing good and evil because you ate of that tree and when the woman saw that the tree was good for food and that he was pleasant to the eyes and a tree to be desired to make one wise another wisdom she took off the fruit thereof and did eat and gave also to her husband with her and he did it everybody clear verse 7 now and the eyes of both of them just like lucifer told them where water were open and they knew at the beginning they didn't know their conscience was protected now they knew that they were naked and they saw fig leaves together and made themselves water the first time that this concept of nakedness was opened he produced shame between adam and eve and shame led to the first manufacture of clothing everybody clear the first manufacture of clothing by human being was introduced when the concept of nakedness and shame was introduced to the human species the animal didn't need clothing your dog till today downey clothes the elephant doesn't need clothes the monkey doesn't need clothes the only one that needs clothes is a man but god veiled the man everybody clear with a different veil everybody clear but brother branham said an immoral woman attack a man with three things number one he attacked a man with beauty which is speaking about the first number two he attacked the woman the man with water with sex control and number three he attacked the man with water with her form all her shape everybody clear god veiled the formal and god veiled the sex and god only left the beauty outside so when adam looked at eve adam saw that eve was beautiful because if was god's perfect thought of a beauty to the woman that's why when you follow the scripture you will see the scripture always say esther was fair to look on you understand a big air was fair to look on mirka was fair to look on oh they have a beautiful countenance the bible always speak about the beauty of the face but the bible doesn't give the description of these two so what was actually veiled by the holy veil was these two aspects right everybody so far when these two were opened up to men it produced shame and the production of shem introduced the meeting for clothing you don't put clothing on your face you cover the remainder of the body ever here these things were exposed before but adam was not even attracted to that ever clear the sex was exposed before neither adam or if nobody was caring about it ever here but when this concept was broken but here then the remaining of the body must be covered you see why you need to cover your body now you understand amen let's go to verse 8. and they heard the voice of the lord walking how can a voice walk how can a voice walk that was god himself him and his voice are one they heard the voice of the lord walking in the garden of of eden or in the garden in the cool of the day and adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of who adam already have clothing made eve has clothing made so when god came adam and eve could present before god with the clothing they manufacture themselves by the wisdom of the devil but when the presence of god was coming in the cool of the day their clothing was still speaking of nakedness they had clothing but those clothing were still giving message of nakedness a proper cloth cannot give a message of nakedness [Music] hallelujah the he demon the trees of the garden first man and the lord god called to adam and said to him where are you and he said i heard your voice in the garden and i was water perfect love is removed because perfect love casts out what everybody so far they were living under perfect love under perfect love you don't look at that anymore that's what happened in the sixth dimension that's why in the sixth dimension brother branham was hugging sisters and brother branham could not feel anything this message is perfectly in line with the scripture i was afraid because i was water so even though adam has clothing but in the presence of god adam realized that he was still naked everybody that's why brother branham said when he went to the jungle of africa he found some of the african tribes that were going there without anything on there except the protection of the sex because of the serpent seed but when the holy spirit dropped down everybody clear what used to be normal for those tribes brother branham said the women begin to cover their chest and they all run for clothing about here because the holy ghost removed that last veil completely off amen then they realize like they need clothing this is not supposed to be exposed this is supposed to be hidden are you following me but the devil doesn't stop there anybody care the proper clothing cannot show your form let's keep on going where i was at i was naked yet he was close and i hid myself how do you hide yourself with clothing and he said who told you that you were naked so somebody told him that he was naked have you eaten off the trees whereof i commanded you that you should not eat now adam who told you you were naked so adam was there still blind so somebody came and taught adam what nakedness is and the teaching was removing the veil verse 12 and the men say the who so the woman becomes the teacher the woman whom you gave me to be with me she gave me of the tree and i did what so woman who taught you this stuff verse 13 and the lord god say to the woman what is this that you have done and the woman said who the serpent begot me and i did water so the teaching of nakedness the concept of nakedness was introduced by the serpent to eve and eve took that concept to adam that's why god said you listen to the voice of eve it was a teaching job to verse 21. to adam also and to his wife did the lord god made water so god finally saw that the manufacturer of men was not well equipped to cover what he covered himself before anybody clear god took cuts of skin we know islam and deed water god was the one that clothed them in other words god conceal everybody clear the nakedness everybody care but the devil wants you to reveal ever here dead nakedness ever clear and the devil does that in two ways either he will make you take off your clothes everybody and bring you back to the leaf to the fig leaves ever clear by shortening your clothing or if you too smart the devil will make you keep your clothes but make your clothes unveil your nakedness through in other words even though you were close we can see your shape completely even your curves let's go to revelation 2 and then we're going to pray that's why you hear brother branham talking about form feeding because that form was supposed to be covered that's why when david looked at this the bible said she was of a beautiful continent their eyes were in the face in the face in the face the only one who had an attire different was a prostitute in proverbs 7. then her attraction is now different revelation 2 verse 20. if you dare you can say amen notwithstanding i have a few things against you because you permit that woman kahu jezebel which call herself a prophetess she's a teacher she's a preacher she has a voice to do whatever to teach who gave jezebel her gospel you see now to teach and to set use so number one there is a teaching and after you swallow the teaching then they're gonna seduce you that's what happened to eve first there was a gospel that was opened up to eve when the gospel was opened up then evils beguiled into the act he started with a teaching to teach and to seduce my servant to commit water so you need to be taught fornication anybody clear and to do what you see those words you see that word eating and to eat think sacrifice to water everybody clear so far let's pray now heavenly father lord we thank you again for your grace your love your mercy father and for everything you have been doing for us father we have done what any man on planet earth that you give any sensible intelligence can do is to take the word and he can read it if they have been in school alone father about school doesn't interpret your word it takes the holy spirit to bring your word to life lord father may you move me completely out of the way may you come and speak to your children and bless us today lord we rebuke every demonic spirit away from us lord may you conceal us under the angels of heaven lord and may father something be spoken this morning that will bring us closer unto thee we humbly ask it in the name of jesus christ amen god bless you we're on part 42. i want you to keep this scripture in mind you have heard that he was saved by them of all time that shall not commit adultery in the law of moses you must go commit adultery you must do it in the physical then when they catch you in the physical then they take you and stone you they must catch you like the woman that was caught in adultery they must catch you in adultery everybody clear but but i say unto you that whatsoever locusts on a woman no more the act first but the sight the one who look on a woman to last after her hey but here adam look at eve adam never lasted on eve anybody abraham neverlasted hagar a teaching have to be given to adam first to cause adam to last on if ever care a teaching have to be handed to abraham first to cause abraham to last on edgar and that whatsoever look on a woman to last after her has committed adultery with her with her already in the water so right here adultery doesn't start in the physical yet adultery started in the heart by the lust but what make a man last on a woman amen how can you look at a woman and last on her amen the scripture said when david saw she was beautiful to look on that is not lasting and but here when rebecca was coming back home she saw isaac from afar off and she asked who is that they said that my master and she closed the veil brother brother said he was love at first sight he was not lost but lost walk us as a woman that a man will look at her and says that he lost him we already spoke about the weakness of the body of a woman we explained to you that that weakness was in the flesh everybody clear so far now we're gonna touch the element beauty today that's where we stop in first corinthians chapter 15 verse 45 the bible say and so it is written the first adam was made a living soul everybody here the last adam was made a quickening spirit so right here we have two of them we have the first adam and the last adam or the second atom so when they say last we cannot have a third atom it's going to be contrary to the scripture everybody clear now isaiah 53 verse 2 the bible says that for he shall grow up before him as a tender plant speaking about christ and as a root out of the dry ground he has no form nor crumbliness this is jesus christ the last adam and when we shall see him there is no water there is no beauty that we should desire him that's why brother branham said adam was not beautiful because the last adam was a reproduction of the first adam and the last adam when he came he was not beautiful the beauty was taken off of him because when god created the animal in the garden of eden the man was the one that was beautiful but when god created the human being god took the beauty of adam and putting it on the woman that's why adam was attracted by the beauty of eve it was a beauty that belonged to him hallelujah in marriage and divorce brother branham say sin is pretty the picture of judas as some old drunkard sought out here on the street somewhere a mouth hanging with flies in it and so forth as judah judah was water handsome strong a deceiver he and that guy to watch around you he and that guy a guy that the old farmer come in with a pair of overalls on to watch around your wife it is that slicker he is the water the rust cow so a normal man is not too beautiful about here death in the had a son by the name of absalom and absalom was beautiful from the head the tail of his head all the way to his soul and he was the one that caused more deception in israel because he reflected lucifer hallelujah ezekiel 28 verse 12 son of man take up a lamentation upon the king of paris amen and say unto him we spoke about this that says the lord god that seals up the sun he's the top full of wisdom anybody clear and perfect in water so when god created the angel the top of every angel was lucifer yes yes sir you following me everybody clear and lucifer was the one that sealed up the sun he was the top full of what wisdom and what beauty this lucifer has wisdom and also beauty now according to genesis chapter 3 verse 1 the most saddle you understand the top of every beast on earth was the serpent are you following me god was the god of heaven after god the pup was lucifer and he was beautiful you follow me adam was the god of the earth after adam the top the most saddle then every creature was the serpent anybody clear so in heaven we have lucifer on the earth we have the serpent the head of lucifer is crushed and the head of the serpent was adam that's why the serpent never attacked adam do you follow me but in heaven lucifer was what beautiful if lucifer was beautiful how was the serpent clear now hallelujah verse 13 that has been in water the garden of water so who was in eden that has been in eden the garden of god every precious stone was the covering the sergius the topaz and the diamond and the burial dionyx the jasper the sapphire the emerald and the carbuncle and gold the workmanship of that trap of that tavern and of that pipe was preparing the in the day that you were created that the anointed character that covereth and i have said this so that was upon the holy mountain of god so in the very sanctuary of god lucifer was present as the top of everybody in the very sanctuary of god on earth the president was adam but the prime minister was the serpent anybody here that has walked up and down in the midst of the stones of fire that was perfect in their ways from the day that that was created until iniquity was found in water there was something in lucifer that matches the serpent revelation 12 verse 9 and the great dragon was cast out now what i'm reading the scripture the great dragon the bible is calling him the old water the bible didn't say the serpent because the serpent is a snake today makes sense yes everybody clear the bible said that old serpent to remind you that remember that beast that was in the garden not the virgin that was cursed but the original one that old serpent camera called the water the devil and water which deceived the whole water so when the devil came the devil already have a body that he can incarnate and the future of that body matches his future in heaven first person in heaven after outside of god the top on earth outside of adam beautiful beautiful so when the devil came the devil incarnated the serpent and the serpent when he received the fullness of the devil the serpent now was called the devil everybody clear he was called the devil and satan it was not that the serpent was satan the serpent was a creature a beast but when the serpent went the devil incarnated poured himself into the serpent the serpent and the devil become one everybody there was also another body that came on earth that was called emmanuella and one day god also poured himself into the body when god poured himself by ketosis and a morphe into the body that body and god became one that's why jesus is god [Applause] everybody the devil inconnected the beast but god he connected man [Applause] everybody clear so far brother branham trying to do god's service without being in god's will i would not preach it in brother jack's church he told me go ahead and do it but i'm going to the tabernacle to the tabernacle and they'll be about four hours long what a sermon barbara and my subject is the water the beast at the beginning and the beast at the beginning is who the devil in the serpent the beast at the beginning and the beast at the end are you following me brother branham never preached that sermon yet he preached it he never preached it as a title of the sermon but he preached hallelujah you ready they beast at the beginning and they beast at the end at the beginning the garden was the garden of eden but when brother branham came brother branham preached satan's eden so there is a needham at the beginning [Music] which belong to god and there is also a medium at the end which belonged to satan at the beginning people were naked and did not know at the end la audition you are water and you also don't know everybody clear so far blessed be the name of the lord the beast at the beginning and the beast at the end through the water the trail of the serpent takes about four hours i got my scripture all laying out the beast from the beginning he was the beast at the garden of water you see everyone i'm being preached everybody here he is the beast at the water at the end and show that he is a water so brother branham said the beast at the beginning was an animal called the serpent that received the fullness of the devil badly ever here and at the end under satan edema there won't be another beast this time it's not an animal but it's a person receiving the fullness of satan bodily and show that he is a water a religious person and a denomination that made the denomination and come right through the trail of him and prove it to you by the scripture that it is i didn't know that till the holy spirit gave it to me the other day up there brother stephen let's keep going on that one when when pagan rome became what pepperon he never sees because there was a beast that was wounded to death and that beast was the roman empire but that beast escaped the world from roman as a nation to roman as a religion from roman pagan the nation of rome that is called today italy to a religious sect anybody clear the system of romanism ceased when a new king come in he just sat up a new order but when they come into pagan rome through the catholic church through populism he never sees if one pup dies they set up another one one pop dies they set up another one the beast which was which is not yet is which is not which is the which is and shall go into what that serves the holy spirit through the water through the scripture but branham says here that in the book of revelation the bible says that there is a beast that come up from perdition and goes up and down and another one comes up and goes up and down brother branham said that was the succession of pope everybody the devil entered animal when god came god enter a human being so the devil also copy god and look for a human being that he's gonna be inconnected into him but who's going to provide that human being the succession of beast everybody clear praise be the name of the lord now as sentenced trinity less like that satan all the time the antichrist antichrist spirit incarnate in the false prophet then he become the water so we have three steps here the first step when the devil attack he comes as a demon and that demon is called the antichrist this is what he did under the white horse rider but later on the horse rather was given a crown brother branham said you cannot crown a spirit you need to have a man to put a crown on and when he cried into a man that was the first time we had the first pop in history and the pope came up as a beast but that beast is not an animal it's a human being anybody clear when he was incarnated in the pope ever here he was called the false prophet now the last stage we need to have a beast just like he was at the beginning anybody clear so far brother branham say now not a demon that's the antichrist that was in the antichrist but once satan himself is kicked out he comes down and take over the place where the demon was yes and back here the devil then the devil is incarnated in a water it's just water repeating itself that is what judas is carrier towards [Applause] you understand now christ was the incarnated what god incarnated in flesh emmanuel god with us in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was who amen and judah was the son of perdition and jesus was the son of god incarnated god jesus incarnated devil who that's why when christ died judah also died because both of them need to release their spirit everybody clear amen what is this trail of the serpent now we found here that this setting after being kicked out of heaven incarnated himself in the world now he is the beast antichrist first prophet and now the beast and giving the name of water and hell follow him fully satan on his water when they kick him out in heaven he came in the garden of eden he connected the serpent everybody here on the earth he is satan representative on earth and he now is the head of the kingdom of the world the very same kingdom that he offered the lord jesus in matthew 4 satan now become a full king now this happens later on he is a false prophet now he's a pope he will become a beast after a while when he breaks his covenant there with the jews he shall be given a heart of what remember what happened to nebuchadnezzar everybody he won't be given a heart of a beast at that time and satan will incarnate himself because when the church goes water satan is done water now he's still the accuser of the brethren but when we go in the rapture we cannot live with satan over there god is gonna cast satan down but as he's coming down he's gonna find a purple call spiritually a beast and he's gonna incarnate the beast then woe to the one who's gonna miss the rapture because you wanna dealing with a man with a heart of a beast everybody cares so far praise be the name of the lord now the beauty we found out that lucifer was beautiful and the serpent was beautiful brother branham say when a man chooses a certain guilt out of a family make sure i'm online okay he must not rely upon on what for beauty's water because lucifer was beautiful when he came down he went into the serpent beautiful everybody here and beauty karma you ready what beauty modern worldly water is off the water being beautiful is not a problem because we were fashioned by god made by god created by god but when your beauty become designed by the devil then it becomes a problem hallelujah let me drop this by her beauty and her sex control this is an immoral woman thank you my brother her shepherd that gift given to her by who the beauty saturn doesn't sit on your mother's womb to begin to disarm you we already seen that satan doesn't do that the way you come out of your mother that's god if you come up with one arm missing then that's satan satan come to destroy if a beautiful baby's born that's not certain anybody care he said by her beauty her sex control her shape that was given to her by who so you can be born normally by a natural beauty a natural shape a natural prophet but the devil can get you and change you a man can have a big belly like this let him go to the gym he's going to have a six-pack everybody here he was not born with six-pack anybody here the six-pack and the medication the vitamin he takes are gonna change his muscles and everything and he looked different than the way he was created he has been designed by the gym make sense you were born now you are designed by the dream what you look is not a product of your birth it is a product of a new work that was put upon you everybody clear the jezebel before the window is a different jezebel after the window before the window jezebel was natural when she presented herself to vamp jehu she looked different than when she was in her bedroom she was now designer they byproduct they're certainly she is sent to deceive the sons of god and she can slay an immoral woman more of them to hell than any other instrument satan has got because he's working in the weakness of a woman and the beauty of a woman anybody clear so far blessed be the name of the lord that is the reason sometime sometimes some times not all the time read your prophet well sometimes a view a pretty woman is a bed for water not all the time sometime the serpent was beautiful but the serpent have the maha he was crafty he was saddle those character plus beauty attracted the devil to her anybody being beautiful is not a problem but the condition of your heart might pull the devil towards you because your heart is not in good condition with god then the devil can use you just like he used the serpent anybody care a pretty woman is a begged for satan sometimes if he can just get a hold of her he can twist more men into hell than he could with all the bathrooms in the country that's right oh and what not only systems a handsome some great handsome man that would not stand up in the world in his trueness of water so there is a womanhood and there is also a manhood just as women are not supposed to break the womanhood men also are not supposed to break their manhood because the devil can anoint you to destroy the daughters of god anybody care see again he can swing them women to the devil and send them to hell yes sir nothing certain to us in what we see that in ezekiel what did he try to do in the beginning make a more beautiful kingdom then who because my car was crushed christ created the devil was not pleased he wanted to take what was created and make it beautiful by perversion hey but here not by creation blessed be the name of the lord hallelujah but in the human race it is the woman that is pretty not the man originally it's that way why was he done to deceive by her designer satan is still water satan doesn't go into the womb to work on women but he's working on women by designing women everybody here her designer saturn is still working on her too in this water how is set and working there is nothing that can stoop like her she's designed so that she can be deceived and satan is really working on her today in this last day because he is her designer who started to work on her adam or satan god or satan see that is her what it is her chief weapon to throw man to her weapon so the designing of the devil is to take a natural woman and cause that woman as a tool to bring men to uncleanness anybody care being a pretty woman she can sway a man any way she want to it's the pretty woman walking down on the water doing water twisting herself and water that is what takes that is the deceiver well and she is deadly with it absolutely water so eve was innocent in the beginning no shame no concept of nakedness if was walking normal eve was talking normal if was created beautiful if was unconscious on this part all the way down it is the devil i explained to you that came to eve and engage into a discussion with eve and begin to teach eve to walk a certain way hallelujah let's continue how much alike that man and his wife buffing gods in god's edom without one what stitch of clothes on them and knew it not for why didn't they know it for they were there to the senses of water nakedness by water by the holy veil of the water the holy spirit they could look right at each other and they didn't know that they were naked they were there with the holy spirit of holiness they were veiled god's veil yet today can look and not last they turned their head it's a holy veil holy veil god had their eyes they were both one man and the other was woman and they didn't know they were naked because the holiness of god kept their eyes veiled notice god hit the water from water that's why a little girl can walk naked and she doesn't care because her conscience is seared everybody clear the black dog is completely off of her anybody care wish we had some time to lay on there a few minutes look here he said the worshiper wants water as the worship at once purge has no more water conscience brother brother says it means desire so if an adam did not have the desire to sin but when the serpent spoke to eve the bible says that eve so that the tree was good for food and one desired to make one water what is that wisdom what is it james one but every man is tempted when he's joined away of his own what and what so lust must be finding you first and then the devil uses your own lust and begin to pull you away from your own lust that's why we need to check the condition of our heart that's why malachi forecam to turn the water everybody here because the devil will use what you already have and begin to pull you off of them that's why brother branham said you need to cover your weak spot if you know that you have a problem with lust put your computer in the living room amen then when lust has water when you really swallow it and you agree with it like eve then your eyes change when lust has conceived it brings off water and sin when it's finished when eve ate of the fruit ever care when it consumes the fruit and work here then it brings water he starts by a lust a desire a feeling and that feeling will birth something and that birth will lead you to sin and that sin will open the door for what death romans 6 23 for the wages of sin is water you understand why sin lead to death because it's the salary of sin once you've already seen there is a salary coming up they're going to pay you very well and the pay is death hallelujah but the gift of god is water eternal life to jesus christ our lord that's why brother bradham said the tree of life was christ because christ carried eternal life the apostle james showed us the course that sin takes the path of sin james one brother branham read the scripture yesterday he said as sin started in nothing but the water just the feeling and the devil can use that feeling and pull you away outside of god promise everybody certain sydney she was naked in needham the two kingdom alike one is the law sin and death the other one is life and righteousness is there in there she was there with the holy veil they were both naked they didn't know they didn't know nothing about it because they were water there with god's water but the devil brought a different wisdom what is that wisdom james 3 verse 15 the wisdom this wisdom descended not from earth from above but it's what it's a worldly wisdom which is what and what the definition of essentially is something that is related to or involving gratification of the senses and physical especially sexual so the wisdom that the devil brought to evil was a sexual wisdom because he has the maha he knew biology very well anybody care he knew that and out of me pretty well now in the last churches we found here that they are naked again certain seeded and don't know but it's not the holy spirit veil it is the veil that satan sleep over eve back then you understand now a veil of water you understand now a veil of lust the last veil they are so filthy till they don't know that they are naked our women on the street we've short on sexy dress you can see a woman today dressed with a long skirt but he even shows the curvature of her back who's discerning that god perverted from innocence don't miss this now the church has been with the last veil on notice what it's done here it perverted her from a nonsense to water which knowledge the holy veil she was innocent with the last veil she is now knowledgeable she knows it's pleasant who told you she knows what he does it's a fruit a tree to be desired making one water that wisdom she is perverted from a nonsense to who to knowledge from holiness to what and what and from life to water take exodus 32. so if in onsen don't know anything about the nakedness and the shame but the devil brought the knowledge and that knowledge took her from knowing nothing to being a phd professor everybody clear and she had two schools she had the teaching part about clear and she led she has the or the laboratory part because when you learn biology you learn biology as a concept then you go to the lab to practice exodus 32 if you're there you can say amen verse one and moses said to aaron what did this people to you that you have bought such a great sin upon them and aaron say let not the anger of my lord works hard you know the people that they are set on mischief the desire of israel was already wrong for they said to me make us what what did lucifer propose eve to be like what okay make us god we shall go before us for us for this moses the man that brought us up out of the land of egypt we know not what has become of him and i said to them whosoever has any gold let them break it off so they gave me then i cast it into the fire and there came out this cuff so the calf just came out oh he was the one working on it but when moses is asking no no no i just put and the fire and the calf came out accountability are you there watch verse 25 and when moses saw that the people were what i thought israel had clothed you see now when the people saw that they were naked for aaron had made them water to their water remember nakedness and shame goes together naked to them and made them naked to the shem among their water when sin entered he uncovered nakedness israel was there the sin of aaron made israel naked you follow me now now get this now what is this knowledge you ready praise god satan did it by the woman water for water remember eve says serpent sit here and tell me what it is she showed the interest and that interest is what the devil pulled make sense for sex which she chose by her own choosing he was if that led adam to the water that's why adam said it's not me the one who taught me is the woman everybody here and it was the woman that took off her clothes before her adam took it off so when adam came and adam looked at him eve had her clothes already off that cloth was a holy cloth everybody clear if you used to walk a certain way everybody care but when the devil came and taught ease and disarming even and took is to the laboratory and work on ease and how to twist herself how to twist her hips when adam came and saw if walking a different way than eve was walking then adam look at eve and begin to last he was eve that led adam to the wrong he was the woman that took off her clothes before adam took off his it's the woman always it's always been it's still the same thing now notice by what sex desire of sex she lasted for knowledge to know what what was this and how whether this fruit was good or not and she did it eve could not sin until she laid a sad god's word opening up her water of water through her water and begin to do water everybody clear wow certainly my husband has never told me these things i believe that's you serpent he told me i should not do this but you know serpent you make it so real and so plain he was a teacher i believe it will be wonderful because you are making it so plain to me you need a prophet to see this everybody clear ever clear you need a prophet to see this the devil came down and got into the serpent i just explained this and he found eve in the garden of eden naked he talked about the fruit in the midst the meat means water and so forth you understand in a mixed congregation and he said now it's pleasant it's good to the eyes what did he do he begin to make making love to eve and he lived with her as a water and she's saw he was pleasant so she went and told her what the job is done the devil wiped his hand and he's out now eve will continue that religion everybody clear your trail of the serpent just like he was on the serpentine but it's absolutely proven to be right i got paper right here out of the paper when a woman right now some of these great juices has got the picture of the original a snake crawling on a woman's water and just in how he goes around here i explain you this she has all kind of sensation and things something a man could never touch her with with this huge snake wrapping around and so forth that is exactly the truth it's going worse than worst it will get worse serpent he could not have had the sex affair with when he was a water brother branham said they took a serpent and the wrap hell and the robbed the serpent around the woman and the serpent produces something that no man can touch because the first time he hurt you need the serpent to take you to a level of anesthesia and if you notice there was only two act done and there was three children born he corrected now she gave birth to twins too one of them was the serpenty and the other one was able she enticed her husband so eve never came and just say adam take this and eat that was not what eve said eve begin to seduce adam because adam was still under the veil so if the serpent taught eve how to remove the veil amen so they even went to adam and begin to take off the veil from adam she enters her husband then she did what showed her husband what he was and then he lived with her also it was jezebel teaching the teaching of a woman notice it was if that satan used to make adam water by her water now eve became an instrument that can cause adam to look and last then commit what adultery now the same doing the same thing today how bout her painted face sexually dressed she does that and don't know that every one of those things is contrary to the water to cut her hair make her a dishonorable woman a prostitute to wear shorts put her disgracefully put sexy dress on make her a what because the last stuff satan she calls her she calls her adam to last after water so the devil understood now the devil uses the woman and design her clothing and design everything that a woman can put on instead of concealing covering her shape and her sex the woman now is wearing clothing that exposes and reveal her shape to cause lust to the sons of adam man looks at natural beauty it's deceiving that is why a woman was given that beauty for deception a beautiful woman if she don't use it the right way it is a curse to her that will send her to hell quicker than anything else i know if she can be pretty sure as long as she stay with her water and that's what is what that is fine and dandy but she can take that same thing how she can deceive with it for he was given to her to do everybody clear let me head to the airport she gave birth to twins one of them was the serpentine the other one was able i read this already that this fellow found eve in the garden of eden this young woman that know no sin know if not what her nakedness was and he knew he was smart brother kelly saddle wise and he told her the fruit was pleasant and he was desirable when he leave with her that morning then the afternoon she did water she persuaded adam to do the same thing telling him what he that's why god said you listen to the voice of eve the woman was the one that was white she was designed over for perversion change over for water not created that's why see where the beauty takes her to now that is why today we found that women is on the increase of water france which has been the seat of satan paris for 100 years women vulgarity nastiness we used to go there 25 years ago to get their water to put on our water we got so low till they come out of here and get our design to put on their women that's right newspaper and magazine picks it up and the poor people are water what is the devil doing today that design when you were the designer the designer we're designing the clothes it is the devil knowing the weakness of the body of a woman and using the beauty not to conceal but to reveal that's why you look at every woman almost that is on the street their clothes are tight have you seen that going to the wedding going to a wedding that is not a message believe a wedding going to one of the wedding you're going to have a hard time because you will see all the men in suit wearing very good you're going to see every single woman almost 99.9 wearing tight clothes amen and the tight cloth they wear if they give you a pepper you can sit and join amen and today they have even clothing that show every morphology where god brought the skin to clothes to protect so that when men see you they don't really know how you are but the clothing today are tight so you can see the curvature you can see everything every curve a woman is doing it is revealing the nakedness of a woman and that revelation of the nakedness will bring lust and at last will cause a man to commit adultery with you in his what that's why form feeding clothes that are tight are wrong for a woman because god gave the clothing to cover not to reveal amen the devil is smart you wear a long dress but that dress is tight it's showing what you tried to cover your dress is long but we can still see what is going on you are now causing lust and by causing lust you are anointed by who everybody clears so far everybody clears your phone now what was supposed to be covered by god the sex and the form of shape now what he does it is unfolding that's why a woman body is a different body because he was created with weakness he need to be protected he need to be shielded he need to be concealed not revealing because when it's revealed it caused trouble now the next time we're gonna see how the high heel will affect this form and then accentuate that to make sure even though you wear a long dress men will still see what the devil wants you to see everybody clear that will be part 43 let's stand there [Applause] if you were worrying about time i finished nine minutes before amen this teaching goes like we went in eternity and it feels like oh we went into a journey we did it yes in the journey in the mind of god yes but he was here the reason why we went through this if i tell you don't wear tight clothes you won't understand if i tell you don't wear short clothes you won't understand it's going to be a legalistic view and when you leave the message you start wearing the same clothes because you thought it was a legalistic view you didn't understand amen holiness he's in the message holiness was preached by wesley amen so it's not something that people connected to the message the message the message the problem is you didn't understand why so now you understand that the body of a woman is a special body everybody else was created on the original the woman was the one created by the second creation by a by product make sense amen that's why you protect your yourself more than a man amen and what branham say even men have to stay on the true manhood that's why men should now wear tight paint everybody clear almost we have in a hard time finding suit nowadays because almost all the suits they're making the top is good and the bottom is tight why satan want to reveal something that is hidden amen those are homosexual spirit that was a tight tight pen amen when a man sits you see them tight that's homosexual but he was prophesied that the earth is going to be under the sword of my condition wow the last on the man and the last on the women that's why hell is on earth we are living in satan seeded very bad clear so watch your clothing i'm not gonna sit here telling you this is two millimeter this is three millimeter when you put on your clothes you have a mirror look at yourself is what i'm wearing revealing me or is he concealing me anybody clear am i revealing my form am i unfolding myself or am i concealing myself whenever you put a cloth that you see you are revealing yourself just know you're already breaking your womanhood amen when the clothes are tight here the clothes are tight here until they can form ever and i'm gonna show you when we deal with the high heel brother branham isn't saying about the bra of a women they were a certain bra that were made to boost the chest of a woman to cause lust everybody clear i'm going to show you the quotes from brother branham amen the problem is causing lust and that's why brother branham said in the day of judgment you're going to find yourself answering for adultery yet you've never done it but the way you form yourself the way the clothing you put in yourself instead of concealing you you begin to reveal yourself until people can look and they may look at your ship and automatically they after your ship because you didn't understand this principle so it's not legalistic view it is the word of god proven by the bible proven by the scripture that's why brother branham say dress like a lady amen you cannot look at the lady dress well and you begin to last after her if you have that something is wrong with your mind amen it is the wrong woman that is dressed tight high here and twisting herself that's the one that caused problems amen so make sure you come to this church don't disturb folks check yourself turn around tell your husband to check say hallelujah like this amen you put like that hallelujah [Applause] right right mickey when the finish you put a sticker past the inspection where's the next one everybody clear keep your beauty for your own husband amen when you are married you in the bed chamber don't even call me we don't have any problem amen but when you go outside that beauty is for your own husband amen because when you're doing that you are disrespecting him he belongs to him you are exposing that and you see a man wearing a i mean uh holding a woman he have a suit and a room and have a short like this and he's going out not even understanding that's the world that will live in it do you think the pentecostal preacher will preach that the after money they have to have if they preach that the people will leave their church they're not going to have money they're going to run away so to keep the women in church they just took off now it's wild you go to a funeral you look at the funeral you just put your hand down your head down unbelievable and all of them married women married women married women married women married women you bring them 20 years they were not even wearing what they're wearing today because it's like a frog they have been cooking them slowly slowly slowly slowly until now you look you say okay what else can you do amen the women used to have tight you call that tight when they have tight and they put a skirt after a while they removed the tight and they put a long t-shirt now guess what the tights don't have a long t-shirt anymore they work with titan and what branham said the women will walk naked and when you look at the tight it shows everything everything everything how can a woman come out of her house like we we were having a tight without anything that's what the devil that satan eden because the devil wanted to reveal what was hidden in eden what god came to clothe the devil took it off why he want to cause a different thing don't do that let's pray heavenly father lord we thank you again for your grace your love your mercy and for everything you have been doing for us father most then all we know and we understand that the hour is treacherous and it's very imperative that the holy spirit comes and help your children father without a personal revelation that you can give to an individual a young man or a young sister we can preach like this and they won't get it and they will go out and continue to do the same thing but as a shepherd father i am pleading that lord father you be merciful to great unto us lord that revelation to understand the sacredness father of the body that you have given us father you spoke in your word that you have given a woman three sacred virtues motherhood womanhood and virginity lord father here you are emphasizing on more on womanhood on the behavior of a woman the way she presented herself before men the way she portray and the way a young man should present themselves father even under the air among the young people we see many things that we see on the world father we know that there is a spirit behind those things but may lord father this church the young people of this church reflect not me father but reflect the gospel the message that has been preached in this church father so that they can be living epistle father showing forth your glory that lord father like he was in nazareth a bad and a wicked city but yet a woman could come out there lord virgin father having all the three virtue and you came down and used her and her name was written in the scripture may lord father the younger sister in this church may the mother may the father may the younger brother lord father may oh lord father we find grace like mary lord father to be found living your word according to the way you send it lord father made the holy spirit come and quicken that word and interpret that word to the heart of your children so that it won't be a head knowledge but it's going to be a revelation to the heart until we grasp the concept that you want us to conceive lord father our nakedness lord father we thank you for everything and we commit your children unto the hand and those that were streaming lord father take the entire weekend and the beginning of this week unto the hand in the name of jesus christ amen god bless you church we love you what a joy wonderful so i'm

you've spoken to us today the deceitfulness of satan but lord you said when today will come as a flood you raise a standard for your children we'll make it through lord with your help or father we thank you for reaching people who can preach the word in this age pure word or god like the prophet said young people will carry this message forward and preaches in his spirit oh lord how we thank you for such people that we'll stand here and preach nothing but the word of god give us hearts that will accept it give us heart that will walk every day taking this world into our hearts oh god
