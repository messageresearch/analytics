here it's a special thing very very special i have one praise report that's written down and and i don't know if it was mentioned wednesday night we want to encourage so we don't lengthen out you know the song services to write the praise reports and the prayer requests down um there's sometimes there's three by five cards back there where brother um shem is you can write your praise report down and we do have prayer requests cards as well amen so our first one has to do with brother robert our praise report it's your birthday isn't it is it your birthday tomorrow well that's close enough we're not going to be here tomorrow amen listen his wife wanted to tell him and his family what a great husband and a great dad he is and listen he's the best deacon is he not how much do we appreciate brother robert here a man a man he went through our trial with us he understands i'll say he understood because we're beyond that we're the resurrection of that amen but we love you brother robert and we appreciate the job you do and the care that you have everything you put into this building the time and even us what you put in for us we appreciate you brother god bless you richly amen amen hallelujah [Applause] now he will be they will be he will be making an announcement here in just a minute but i do have a couple of uh prayer requests also brother lamont texted me this morning and uh wanted us to remember his he said um keep my blood brother and my aunt in prayer uh he said he was headed down to south carolina his aunt is having health issues and his brother is in the hospital because of his blood pressure so you know me i said what's their names we gotta we gotta put their names out there because we'll cover it with the name of jesus so he said his brother's name is taurus may so remember that and his sister i mean his aunt is willie ann uh robeson so i told him i would mention those names and just you know we'll ask jesus to cover whatever you know i mean my goodness so i have one other here i'm not sure whose name is on it it says my cousin's family he's died he died exactly four months ago his wife suffered a massive stroke on the plane while traveling to come here for her daughter's wedding she died friday the 15th i don't know who sent that out god knows um so let's remember that brother sam do you mind stepping up here you're right up front and cup yes sir yes sir jason demars okay do you know him brother sam do you i know brother jason watkins and we've been we've been down there once or twice but remember him okay unspoken hands up put our antennas up let god know amen amen i'd just like to thank the lord before we go to prayer i had two hours yesterday with that special deacon and a kayak two hours with brother robert falbey in a kayak is like the road to emmaus we had us a time oh my he was there from the moment when he stepped out of the out of the truck he was right there but anyways with that in mind let's just uh approach our dear lord and savior jesus how we love you lord oh father we're so grateful for this relationship that you've unveiled to us lord that personal relationship of yourself to ours is that new birth experience lord jesus and now lord that we've had that birth of that seed that germination of that seed father pour the water of your word in and help us to grow lord god not just into a partial image but into the fullness of the godhead lord jesus for that's what you're yearning for lord you're yearning for your children to come to a place where they perfectly love perfect love help us father help us help me lord help me lord lord jesus and you told us lord god that if we abide in you and you abide in us that we could ask what we will lord we could ask for this brother lamont whose natural brother lord is suffering with blood pressure lord and for his aunt will he may lord jesus we just pray lord god that you'll minister to her healing father god help her lord jesus and for brother jason's church it seems like satan is just targeting the message churches especially with his coven but those demons don't attack those that are of his own flock he attacks those who are outside of his flock father but greater is he that is in us than he that's in the world oh the lord you didn't give us a power of fear but you gave us a spirit of love and of power and of a sound mind and you've taught us to say no to the devil you've taught us to say no to fear you've taught us to say no to frustration you told us to lift up our feeble hands that hang down and consider the ways of the lord jesus who lord went before lord jesus for the joy that was set before him he endured the cross father and lord for the joy that set before us by election and you revealed that election to us at origen now lord god we know what our origin is so we know what our destiny is and lord god we're just looking lord as we grow every day into that full stature of a perfect man father nurtured by your word we love you so much lord god and lord jesus we just pray lord that our worship will be worthy of you lord we pray lord god as children will really be thankful father for the food that you're going to give us today father and lord god will pray that the tithes and the offerings will be given with cheerfulness for the lord loves a cheerful giver and those that don't have lord we know father that you can bless them so they'll have to give abundantly and we commit the rest of this service to you and ask the blessings upon brother stephen as he brings the word anoint his lips to speak and lord even more our ears to hear we ask it in jesus name amen hallelujah brother um sam was getting me stirred up up here watching him dance and i was getting stirred up singing that was good we have a song

you come on up bro and then uh we'll um ask sister zaddy and then we'll turn the passer loose amen i'm excited today i want to know what god's got for me amen [Music] god bless you sweets um i was asked to sing this song a while ago but i kept on pushing it back pushing it back but god is good god is a god of promises and you always keep saying sometimes we might go through our struggles and we might just be dealing with stuff but god is a god of promise he knew us before the foundation of the earth and the past has been speaking about speaking speaking and the power you hold in your tongue and that just has like touched me praise god [Music] the god of abraham you're the god of covenants and faithful promises [Music] time and time again you have proven you do just what you say though

or the are you gonna and then i'll get sisters at it my old mind forgot to bring him up before the um for the announcement so we're gonna let him take his time and then sister out here god bless you all amen good morning thank you for all your blessings and all the love that you share yesterday we really had a wonderful as brother sam was saying it's like being on the river to emmaus the lord just was revealing himself to us so wonderfully it just was his grace really enjoyed that trip but um what i wanted to share this morning um most of us will remember last year we had a uh a special gift given to the pastor as it as it was brought to our attention that there was clergy appreciation month was october and um the day october 10 was actually past appreciation day credits to sister priscilla she kept us on line with that um so last year we we all you know came together and gave him a surprise gift but what's been impressing my heart is for if each family here to show our appreciation to the pastor for his dedication for him yielding himself to the gift that is placed in him and how we all benefit rather than just having a group thing if each family could do that and give him something personally just through this month is that something you think we could do okay amen um [Applause] and uh i believe i could speak for the pastor with this verse of scripture the best thing he would like to see as the apostle john in john 3 and verse 4 i have no greater joy than to hear that my children walk in truth so for all the labor he has been giving let us show our appreciation to the pastor this month god bless you sister zaddy amen amen god bless you church um this song has been on my heart for a few months um and i just wanted to share this with you as a testimony of how great god is and the feelings that i have towards him for all that he's done in my life i also want to just say that lately you know coming into service a few times has just been really hard to break through and i was told by a close sister and brother that you know another way to look at it is the devil's just trying to block you from being a blessing to other people and so you'll take anything and everything to bring towards you to cause you to not do what the lord has called did you do one of the things that we all know is the gift of singing from me and i don't boast in any way i don't think i'm anything great at all i am grateful for my gift and i do want to use it for his glory but a lot of times the feelings and the emotions of life and the struggles of family and friends and everything else um just tries to to hide that um and so today this song is in defiance to the devil that he will not keep my voice and he will not keep my my my spirit from praising the lord um and so that's what this morning i pray that that's what it is and the lord sees my heart and also um that this is a song that you used to sing at living word and every time he was singing he couldn't get to the song he would just break down crying and it came in my heart one day when i was at work and now at work i'll just sing i'll sing in the hallways i don't care who's watching but then why can't i do that when i come into the house of the lord and so no matter what i may feel the feeling of unworthiness that the devil has tried to put upon me or the way that people maybe think about me or the judgments or the when family maybe see you one way and you don't know like how to express yourself and show like no there has been a change you know i just put all of that behind me today and i just move forward in christ because i know he's been too good for me to stand here and not praise him i feel so bad inside when i have to close my mouth and i'm not opening my mouth and so this morning i will open my mouth and defiance to the devil so i pray this song will be a blessing to each and every one of you that are struggling in whatever way you are i'm just listening to the words i come just now to say thank you o king [Music] you're not just a part of my life but my everything [Music] your love it reaches way down deep within passive human understanding there will always be a song for you i'll sing no word alone cannot express my heart's desire gratitude for one more day my needs supplied your warm embrace and tenderness you're patient with me through all my mess i've come to one conclusion you are the best so i'm gonna sing it one more time i come just now to say thank you o king you're not just a part of my life but my everything your love it reaches way down deep within passive human understanding there will always be a song for you i'll see not one word alone cannot express my heart's desire gratitude for one more day my needs supplied [Music] your warm embrace and tenderness you're patient with me throughout my mess i've come to one conclusion you are the best [Music] [Applause] [Music] hallelujah i will sing you are great [Music] [Music] hallelujah hallelujah i will see you are great [Music] church hallelujah i will see [Music] my is [Music] and all of the honor [Music] for everything you've done in our life i'll praise you anyway i'll give you all the glory [Music] hallelujah i'll see [Music] [Music] hallelujah i will see [Music] hallelujah hallelujah let's stand i'm gonna i'm gonna say this as the song leader um i don't think i've ever discouraged anyone from the gift that is placed in them as a singer singers are important they set the battle in a ray to go yes they go first there are others besides sister zaddy here who struggle with allowing that gift to come out and to be used by god and i could call you out individually but i won't okay there's some that aren't even here that are the same way i'm not gonna take any time but i'm gonna say this let god have his way there's no judgment we're not going to judge you we just want god to be pleased if you have a gift your gift i mean brother we know brother stephen has a gift and we acknowledge that and we appreciate it but without that battle being set in an array properly he won't get past this first row of seats sometimes i can't do it as a song leader it takes a special or two or a group to come up and break through and i'm not a i'm not you know i'm not proud to say i'll do it all no i have encouraged sister zaddy since i don't even know since the first time i heard her sing and i still do i've encouraged my daughter sister divine you have a gift brother benjamin does too he just sang the other day i've never heard brother angelo sing a finer song than a while ago it was good brother enoch there are others but please for the sake of the bride if it takes jerking you through a knot hole i hope god does it to get you where you need to be but let's please him and sing and do it for him for his glory sister joanna you really have a you really have a strong voice a very wonderful gift and we appreciate your blessings that you've provided while you're here and we're not done with you okay let's sing only believe and bring our pastor out okay i say all that in love let me please please please encourage you okay it's you you won't believe the benefit that you'll reap for being a blessing the blessing that you'll receive [Music] good to see you [Music] [Music] all things are possible only believe [Music] [Music] all things are possible only believe [Music] lord i believe [Music] all things are possible [Music] i believe all things are possible now one more time jesus is here [Music] [Applause] [Music] jesus lord jesus all things are possible jesus [Music] amen jesus [Music] possible jesus is amen let's give the lord a club you are not clapping to me you are clapping to the king of kings the lord of lords amen blessed be the name of the lord you might be seated a lot of it hallelujah everybody ready tired future been traveling we wait till they come back amen we want to greet you all in the name of the lord jesus christ we appreciate all the family members here we don't have visitors we got a family member sometimes we just live in different parts but we're part of one family we came from one origin we're coming out of god and we're going back to god amen so we appreciate everybody here and we are so grateful very very very thankful to the lord for protecting brother mickey and the family they travel everybody came here safe and they hear this morning may the name of the lord be glorified we thank god for the strength and everything let's give him a clap offering again hallelujah i believe the church was well prepared before the departure of our sister to be with the lord the lord led us to speak about the death about the resurrection about the first death about the power of the resurrection where we came from where we're going until there is no more mysteries in this church if somebody live here and go home we know exactly where they're going amen especially a believer that'll be all for the music thank you very much i'm going to read something brother branham spoke concerning our sister brother brother i mean the message the influence of another he said and leo is perhaps here tonight the same boy and i had his mother's funeral the other day and he asked me say billy i wish you would speak on something that proves that my mother ras again i believe that was preached over and over and over in this church we know exactly that sister gene one of this day if you're not going i'm going to meet her before even we meet into the air she'll be rising up here and i won't be surprised if my ring door rang at home and then i come and i say what's going on say pastor i'm back [Laughter] amen if you don't believe it that's your problem i know exactly where sister genie is amen if there was a true believer she was one of them and i am proud to be her pastor amen brother branham continued he said the lord gave me a message for it wait till we get to the resurrection not this morning on exact positive when the bible all nature everything that god created speaks that she shall rise again who is going to speak against them when the lion roars you know what happened god says so proves it by his nature prove it by water i know brother kalima is here so he's not here so you got to preach with me [Laughter] proves it by his word prove it by her who has a problem with sister jin's life again god prove it to you by her life prove it by her life everything else she's got to raise there is no way nothing heaven enough might fail but that won't fail she's got to come forth again [Applause] amen you know when somebody suffers a lot especially goes through sickness and then depart to go to be with the lord usually we have a tendency to say she's in a better place right now she's resting now she's in a more beautiful place but usually when we say that we are saying that in reference to the sickness can i repeat it again do you want me to repeat again in other words if somebody suffered three months two years three years four years if that person passed away we usually comfort ourselves in a human way like oh don't worry she's in a better place and we usually speak that better place in reference to the sickness or the situation that person was before they depart in other words if that person was sick we humanly comfort ourselves saying she's in a better place in other words and most of the time we follow with this word she's no longer sick that's what we usually say she's no longer sick she's in a better place but that's not really where we should stop amen when we say that somebody left and he's in the presence of the lord it is not only a better place in reference to the situation that took the person home what i'm trying to say is how many people are healthy this morning raise your hand you all are healthy sister gin in there is in a better place more than you can i repeat it again if you are healthy you are sitting this morning sister jean is in the far better condition than you who are healthy not in reference to her sickness but in reference to this entire world she's in the far better condition than you you might be healthy today you can get sick tomorrow but sister gene will never never never again test what they call sickness if she comes back right now sickness won't do anything to her anymore [Applause] hallelujah brother branham says this inconvenience then concern brother branham say and i sinned let me go back again brother branham said that i've seen the people want that as that is going on i seen them there the old was water so if you have a vision of sister gene being old you got the wrong one hallelujah and they were standing there human beings just like i am only without water no more black dog on sister gene it's over with that sin it was beyond water are you beyond perfection here suffering to wake up in the morning sleeping waking up she doesn't even sleep hallelujah you could not mention what it is and when i knew that i had to return back there was only one thing that i would return to try to do what persuade people what the young witchy ruler was looking for whatever you do don't work don't don't three times you can't afford to miss it everything else let everything else go but make ready for water whatever you do so when she we say she's in a better place she's in a far better place than you who are healthy this morning she can no longer get sick she can no longer get trouble she can no longer get old hallelujah brother branham said i don't know what to call it he referred to it there as souls under the altar but when he was i have never there was no way to explain how great that is now you just have to take my word i'm just a man see but this vision that is always come to pass just as i have told you and you know there everyone has been true that it's true also whatever you do if you miss everything else health strength your eyesight whatever it is don't miss it there is nothing can compare with it there is no word in the english language that i know that could express it if you say perfect it is beyond that superb it's beyond that sublime there is no word that i know that could express because it was so then to think that it's not the end of it yet i thought maybe me be afraid to come to this because brother brother was afraid to die he usually wonder if you die what happened but when the lord took him to the sixth dimension and he saw what happened very branham look he said me again be afraid of this that's why paul say i'm praying i wish rather to be out of this tabernacle and to be in the presence of the lord then we who are still here that still have to struggle that still have to pray our ways through and make sure we are right with the lord before we meet him so our sister is in a better place she's happy ever to be happy she already preceded that she started before even we get there so she already started the party over there she's enjoying with brother branham she's enjoying with the same and one of this day he won't take too long not like paul we are right at the end of the end before you know it i won't be surprised if i see somebody ringing my door because over there you know more than what you know here she doesn't need a gps when she's coming back there she doesn't need to know even if i change a home she will know you say how how did peter recognize moses and elijah [Music] how did peter recognize moses and elijah who taught him he was moses and elijah how did the rich young ruler knew that was abraham because he was not born in the time of abraham when you get there there is a different knowledge a supernatural knowledge that is beyond what we can think so we thank god for a truly servant a world lived life with tons of testimony that we can sit here and talk over and over and i salute her sister gene where you are because it's just a blending of dimension she can be still hearing us where you are congratulations you made it god wish liberation [Applause] hallelujah i'm not saying this to please somebody i know him in the power of his water let's stand hallelujah let's go to proverb chapter 9 18. we're continuing with what we started last week i believe the title on youtube is wrong it needs to be changed it's part 15. last week it was tongue in hell and hell this morning is tongue and power how many listened to the sermon last week how many is on board okay i can see smiley face already on board if you're not there you need to go back and make sure you get it tongue and power we're talking about the rich young ruler being in hell everybody clear yes sir i can't change the reading from last week because we could not even sink into what we read let's go to proverbs 18 verse 21 if you're there you can say amen once again we appreciate our family member not a visitor yeah your boss is bringing me this back appreciate your pastor appreciation but robert spoke about it i talked to him last night he didn't mention anything to me so it's like a surprise but your boss is bringing me back so i thank you all for everything just keep praying for me that's the best gift that i can ask prayer proverbs 18 21 death and life you choose what you want are in the power of the tongue you might be seated remember last week not in god's tongue not in your neighbor's tongue your own tongue so depending what you want you're going to get it death and life are in the power of the tongue and they that love it shall eat the fruit thereof what happened in your life who's responsible it to for let's go to luke chapter 16. we're talking about the tongue in hell that's where we are if we finish here then we can go to the lake of fire and we can come up in the resurrection and you're going to see what a resurrection is i'm not going to say it let me just hold it you want to see the resurrection hallelujah 22. if you're there you can say a man and it came to pass that the beggar died you already understand you understand this now and was carried by the angels into abraham bosom this is paradise which was not up there it was below everybody clear there is three compartment in hell but paradise was below in other words when you go to hell you're not going there i'm not preaching you to go there hell is divided in three parts we already went through this the devil is right here at the very bottom this is the center of the devil and the theophany of the people that are not born yet from his kingdom we already went through this then the next one is the angel we already showed you this if you need more coach you see me and then the third one here is the region of the lost the lost here left here they were born like judah when they finished they come back up here but when they come they don't go here they stay right here these are the lost souls like the rich young ruler everybody clear but what luke chapter 16 is showing that at the top here it was divided in two there was a gulf here and this part here was paradise and this one was the region of the lost they went to paradise because the blood of good of bulls and goat was not able to bring them into the presence of the lord so hell have to pull them down when hell is pulling them down it was just a covering god have to put an extension even in hell between those that serve him and those that do not serve him anybody clear but when jesus died amen when jesus died jesus dropped and came here and preached to the souls in prison we already went through this i'm just rebooting the computers okay went to the souls in prison when he finished preaching to them not to be saved jesus dropped down here brother branham say usually when he was coming he was coming in his teal funny oh my i don't know if i'm gonna be preaching okay your theophany depends on where you came from we already preach about the origin okay if you come from god you have a different teopany if you're coming from the devil you're gonna have a different geophony the theophany of the devil doesn't change your age if you die at 10 years old you go there you're 10 years old if you need coach you see me if you die at 50 years old you go in this 50 years old but the theophany of god have only one age if you died here regardless of which age you die whether you are 2 or 90 or 50 when you enter there it's only one age you remain young and god also have his own personal theophany and the theophany of god is called melchizedek [Music] everybody clear but the theophany could never go down to this region like this you follow me and go down to hell all the way down there because god is pure right so they needed to take the word the tiopani and send it to the headquarter of the devil but god cannot enter hell so god made a plan he took your sin he took my sin he took the sin of the entire world and he inoculated that to jesus so when jesus was dying jesus died like a sinner everybody clear so when you die as a sinner automatically you need to go to hell ever here jesus was not a sinner he died as a sinner by carrying our sin so when he died as a sinner his theophany came and detailed and he was melchizedek so jesus entered into mercy and took melchizedek to hell so the word enter hell the atomic bomb finally break into hell you okay so when jesus went down here when he was coming down in this area he was like a light between the cockroaches are you there when he was passing that region the demon just were starting away because the holy one was entering there and finally he came here brother branham said he knocked boom boom boom boom boom and the devil said who are you when the devil opened he said i was looking for you for so long i thought when i killed a boy i got you i thought when i killed moses i got you i thought when i killed joshua finally you are here the lord look at him and he reach out to his side and say satan give me those keys [Applause]

life in your tongue let him refrain his stone from evil and his lips that they speak no what we already talk about the lips and the mouth all together let him extrude evil remember job and do good let him seek water and ensure it but clear verse 12 for the eyes of the lord are over the righteous and his ear are open to their prayers but the face of the lord is against them that do evil and who is he that will harm you if you be followers of that which is what [Music] if you follow something that is good who is that person that can harm you and god send us the message of the hour there's nothing good than that one because god is the word so if you follow this message who can harm you [Music] amen hallelujah is chewing evil last sunday the bible says that there was a man named job that was perfect and upright and one that feared god and his true water that there is none like him in the earth a what a perfect and upright man wonderful god and his true word in the old testament when they were going to hell somebody was perfect not only one person we saw it last week abraham we saw so noah how can you be perfect in the old atonement let's pray heavenly father lord we thank you again for your grace your love your mercy and for everything you have been doing for us father thank you for giving us another opportunity to gather together around the revealed word of the hour lord i have done what any human being that you have given ability and grace to do can do read the pages of your scripture but as far as coming and ministering to your children you only take a supernatural act of the holy spirit father may you move me completely out of the way may you also move this church out of the way may you be the one speaking and the one receiving because we understand further the mystery of the predestinated seed father may you granted unto us the desire of our heart and may you unfold your mystery to us lord and give us a revelation so that it drop way down deep in our heart lord and father it will produce fruit according to what has been given lord we seal the devil completely out and we commit not only this service but this entire day unto the hand even the service in the evening in the name of jesus christ amen you already been seated so let's continue here we on part 15 death the second death we are talking about the tongue and power last week we talked about the tongue in hell everybody clear amen we are in the story of the rich young ruler and the rich young ruler is in hell if you can go with me in james chapter 3. that way we stop he's in hell and we found that in hell he's in torment and being that he's in torment there is one specific spot or member that this rich young ruler have pointed to us that in hell and he says that his tongue was the most place that was burning in hell why his tongue that's what we were trying to get and we got into it why in hell nothing else hurt more than the tongue everybody clear why i hope this thing is going to work correctly praise god amen when we follow the story of this rich young ruler when we follow him in the book of matthew the bible says this it's taking a while go ahead benjamin sit back there probably you might have to do it in matthew chapter 19 verse 20 the bible said the young men say unto him all these things ever kept from are you up what lacquer yet in other words i follow all the commandments i did everything that i could do still what am i missing and jesus said unto him if there will be jesus was not there yet the fourth one anybody clear if that will be perfect go and sell that that has and give it to the poor and thus shall have treasure in heaven in other words this which young ruler here was loaded he had a big luggage and when jesus looked at him he says there is a big luggage that you carry i want you to unload the luggage but your unloading of the luggage is not a loss [Music] when jesus asks you to take away something of your life you're not losing it are you with me when jesus gave permission to satan to go and take the children of job job was not losing his children are you there brother branham said that's the reason why god double everything but he never doubled the number of his children he doubled the earthly things because that was lost they need to be restored but he could not double the children because job will end up having nine children because the first one that job had were already saved here so god could not again dabble the children because by giving good job to uh our new children he was already doubling that [Music] it looks like the devil took the kids away but they were in the presence of the lord none of them were lost when god asks you to unload he doesn't let you unload to lose it [Music] god asks you to our lord he's unloading goes with an investment amendment [Music] are you there when you are lord he told the rich young ruler he said go ahead and sell that you have give it to the poor damn and what and that shall have treasure in water so the more he is given to the poor the more treasure he is gaining in heaven he is unloading on the earth but he's filling his bank accord in heaven take matthew chapter 16 hallelujah how can somebody tell you give me a 10 of your salary and you have a trouble with it not for the pastor i'm not saying that to put in my pocket you know me are you there but he said if you do that this is what i'm gonna do [Applause] they gave him two fishes and three bread the young kid unloaded his lungs [Music] what did he do [Music] if you keep it you lose it you give it to him [Music] matthew 16 verse 24 if you did my god help me i don't know if i'm gonna touch the surface matthew 16 verse 24 if you dare you can say this then say jesus to his disciple if any man will come after me let him do what and take up his water and do water amen am i losing something let me see the next verse four who saw they will save his life everybody see that shall do what you want to save your life shall lose it and whosoever will lose his life for myself shall do whatever so you're not really losing anything you actually preserving something verse 26 for what is a man profited if he shall gain the whole world and lose his own water or what shall a man give in exchange to his water what else can you give it to him [Music] let's go to luke chapter 18 as we're climbing slowly when the lord asks you to unload something you're not really losing it he's unloading and investing at the same time for your benefit luke chapter 8 uh 18 let's go to verse 28. everybody clear then peter said no we have left water in other words we have unloaded everything i was a fisherman i was working you came you saw me you say you leave everything i left my family i left everything it looks like we always just follow you did i lose something [Music] peter said lo we have left all and followed you verse 29 and he said to them verily i say to you there is no man that has left water go look at the story of john sheridan [Music] god told him take that house and give it to somebody he become a multimillionaire [Music] he said there is no man that has left the house all parent all brethren all wife all children for the kingdom of god's sake who shall not receive manifold in other words many times more in the future time what did your bible say [Music] in the present time and in the world to come life water so when you lose something you're not really losing it you are actually investing and god is duty bound to pay you back and brother branham said god paid back very good brother i'm saying when you give god something he's going to give you a hundred thousand times i want him to have my children i want him to help my wife i want him to have my job i want him to have my business i want him to have this church i want him to help me because when our lord he gave him opportunity to bless me more [Applause] brother brother said god punch job to bless him more the rich young ruler they ask him to unload and come and follow me when god asks you to unload something not only is he investing that back but he also means that he have a new lord for you [Music] hallelujah god cannot remove something and leave you empty if god take the old nature out he has a new nature that he's trying to put in you so by you clinging to the old nature you actually blocking your blessing [Music] hallelujah hallelujah the bible says in the book of psalms chapter 37 and 37 the bible said mark the perfect man and behold the upright for the end of that man is what if this young rich ruler would have listened his end could have been but he didn't want to listen he said i got too much money i cannot do it so there is no way i can do it i need to move on let's go back to james chapter 3 now when god asks you to unload it's for an investment and for a job that he has for you this man did not understand that he has a gift to be an evangelist and god was trying to take his burden and put on him so he can carry a different load and gain everything else he want to keep his lord and he lost his reward everybody clear now james chapter 3 where we were let's move on brother david if you got triple a you can change this verse james chapter 3 verse 2. the bible say for in many things remember we offend all we talk about abraham we talk about job perfect if any man offend not in what in word the same is uh we're talking about the word and the perfect man everybody here last sunday we talked about job a perfect man we mentioned noah a perfect man we mentioned also uh uh abraham god asked him to walk and to be perfect and we found that everybody that was spoken about being perfect the devil tempted them by their mouth that's why the bible said in all of this job never never sinned with his water that's why the devil came back and said curse why did he want job to curse why didn't he want job to go drink why he didn't want a job to go do something else or kill somebody because god told the devil that job was a perfect man and a perfect man according to james is a man who know how to what to control his tongue everybody clear so we spoke about job we spoke about abraham let's bring another perfect man today and that man has also a stature called the stature of a what that meant his name is who jesus james says that if a man does not offending word he is a perfect man and there is no perfect man in this world that is more perfect than the lord jesus christ [Music] everybody clear and that man called the lord jesus christ he himself is the word of god [Music] the bible says in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was who we explain you this the same was in the beginning with god all things were made by water and without him was not anything made that was made in other words him being the word created everything by the word so the word have a creative power hallelujah in hebrew 11 verse 3 the bible said through faith we understand that the world's plural we're framed by water so everything that we see here was generated by the world and a man who control his word that man is a perfect man hallelujah so that defeats which are seen were not made of things which do appear if i say hello did you see hello did you see hello if i said good morning do you see it you can hear it but you don't see it that word created things this desk here was created by an invisible voice [Music] hallelujah just like abraham when he went to trial abraham watched his mouth you remember last sunday job going to trial job also watch his mouth and this man also when he was put in trial he also was guarding his mouth hallelujah the bible says this oh my that first peter for even here until when he called because christ also suffered for us leaving us a water an example that you should follow his step what is the step we need to follow who did not water neither was what found in his water abraham lied [Music] himself job justified himself but jesus christ nobody could convince him of sin he was the sinless perfect lamb of god everybody clear who when he was without refound not again distract him they say prophesy he was just quiet watching them hallelujah when he suffered he threatened not he never said you will see [Music] hallelujah but committed himself to who to to who to him that judge righteously hallelujah isaiah said he was oppressed he was afflicted yet he did water a perfect man a man that knows how to control his tongue everybody he opened not his mouth his broad has a lamp to the slaughter and as a sheep before his shearer is what so he opened not his water yet marco the archangel when contending with the devil he disputed about he disputed about the body of moses does not bring against him a water a reeling accusation he didn't even want to insult the devil he could not say stupid devil crazy devil but what did he say but say the lord rebuked him clear a perfect man a man that knows how to control his water everybody clears so far now as we continue that attribute that was displayed by the control of this tongue is called temperance anybody clear what is temperance brother branham to my knowledge i add temperance come on water self-control hallelujah i like that my country thinks of this macron my soul with self-control why do you want to crown your soul with self-control from seed to shining cc in the statue of a perfect man brother branham say temperance does not mean stop drinking alcohol here either no no temperance does not mean alcoholic you not in this case this is barber temperance holy ghost water holy spirit temperance it is not your temperance that you were born with it is a temperance from the holy spirit that is just one of the lust of the flesh but we are talking about holy spirit temperance in other words some people have temperance by nature they're just born they're quiet you can push them they're just quiet that is not temperance i have a friend in dental school he looked at me very polite a classmate very polar you would never hear him say something wrong very respectful one time i was talking to him he said you know what when i get angry i curse in my mind [Music] so for appearance to appeal to people for the sake of the job because the job that he's gonna get require him to behave a certain way he's doing it but inside of him he's cursing [Music] hypocrite hallelujah this is bible temperance holy spirit temperance that is just one of the last of the flesh but we are talking about holy spirit temperance that means how to control your tongue not be tattling how to control your temper not fly off every time anybody speaks cross to you hallelujah amen boy a lot of us going to fall off before we get started aren't we see then we wonder why god is not isn't his church [Music] why you don't see god in the church why you don't see god in your life hallelujah doing miracles and things that they used to do yes sir add these things add tempers to it oh temples how to answer in water when rough is water somebody say you bunch of holy olives down there don't jump out and roll up your sleeve now not that but talk with water godly love temperance kindness is that the way you want to be congregation say when you are round upon run not back let him be your water hallelujah if you have not just a man-made health sister believe or temperance oh i ought to slap him down but maybe a better note because they might put my name in the paper about it i don't want to fight because the police will get me and they're going to take me to jail my record will be gone and i'm going to lose my job and then everybody in the church would know that i got into a fight because of that i refrain you're still a sinner are you there if i say this they will say how did he stay in the message longer and talking like this you better even react are you there i'm not telling you to kill somebody anybody care if he was not for this message he would have seen it then you go and slap the door [Music] you're finding yourself right that is the kind of temperance he's talking about don't try to add that don't use it and add it it won't work he's going to bounce it back everybody here he won't work that's why you burst out you hold you all you all then you let it go out amen but when you can really with the sweetness from your forgive every man hold your water let it be water then he can volcano you can connect that one hallelujah oh my blessed be the name of the lord it's so loaded it's going slowly wherever you go press who if a man gets angry and curses you bless god between you and him [Applause] if a guy calls you a holy holy bless god between you and him if the wife gets you angry with you please if the husband gets angry please if the children aggravate you please whatever you do bless who if and mama give you a little spanking and correct you bless who remember what god said bring up a child in the way you should go always remember please put god before you and you shall have reverence for god respect for him that is right [Applause] i don't want anybody in this church to fight on the internet i don't want anybody in this church to fight in instagram to fight in whatsapp to fight in facebook whatever they say bless god [Applause] [Applause] hallelujah oh my god blessed be the name of the lord we found out that abraham under the old atonement [Music] uh a job under the old atonement noah under the old atonement jesus christ was the atonement himself he was perfect he was the word and his very heart his desire is for his children to be perfect [Music] the bible says in matthew 5 be there for what even as your father which is his heaven is water how can i be perfect when i'm born in sin when i'm shaping iniquity coming in the world speaking lies how can i be perfect god cannot ask you something if you don't have the ability to do it and not only if you don't have the ability to do it when god asks you something he already provided a way for you to do it [Applause] [Music] oh church you need to understand god hallelujah if god asks you something just know there is already a way for you to do it [Applause] [Music] you're asking me to be perfect so there already is a pro a path to become perfect if not he will ask you [Music] when elijah met the widow woman he never said give me a bed he said give me water drink do you think he didn't know she had a drink but she had the last one [Music] if that woman would have refused what could happen hallelujah he said be thou perfect as your heavenly father is what perfect in hebrew 10 verse 1 the bible said for the lord having a shadow of good friends to come and not the very image of the thing can never with those sacrifices which they offer year by year continually makes the camera there on to water that's why they were going to paradise abraham you do what you do paradise job you do what you do pereira david you do what to do pereira because the law could not bring a worshiper to perfection a man a perfect man who can control his water verse 14 for by one offering he has done what he have done what perfected how many time every year the high priest have to go offer come back you start january they collect your sin february they collect your sin march they collect your sin by the time we get to april you already have a big truckload there of sin the high priest have to bring everything and dump it then when you go back again you start again collecting again every year god said that was

perfect [Music] [Applause] hallelujah by one offering he has perfected forever they that are sanctified what does he mean brother brahma hallelujah brother branham says in the message perfection he said that is the answer to the death of christ that's the answer to calvary he absolutely with his own blood purchased our sin and perfected is what therefore in what we stand now [Applause] if you have done something wrong and you just say father i'm sorry there is nobody can come and pray to you that sin again [Applause] oh my god i hope you're getting this perfected in the presence of god

over there so when god brings his word and put it on you automatically you under authority [Music] when they say john pick up the book it means something are you there you have control over the

disciples struck the head saying so my my tongue me moving that mountain i don't even have explosion he said to roll out to pull down to do what and to do what to do what and to do what all of this can be done by your tongue [Music] you can prank your children or you can root up your children [Music] you can destroy your children or you can bless them they're in the bad company you can root them

who stopped her [Music] do you know what he said made i want to say it's my child he said maida take your hand off come here come here sit down take that shard give it to god you give it to god yes but she need to listen to me forget about it don't watch what she's doing okay just keep keep washing your dishes go where you want to go they didn't put an alarm so that when the door opened he's going to do kinking [Music] they didn't have a dog there so when she moved on he got baby she's outside go catch her [Music] church it's time to relax and to use what god gave you to do the work you pulling i gotta stop let me let me go to the airport because i can't i can't move on quickly everybody clear so with the tongue you can root out you can pull down you can destroy you can throw down you can build and you can paint whatever you want to do you can do it with which power the power of the tongue amen the bible said in isaiah the lord god has given me the tongue of the water that i should know how to a word in water to him that is what you can take somebody who's down and you sit and you talk to them you talk to them and the man rise up in faith he said brother thank you for coming to see me god bless you sister it was a pleasure i'm gonna rise up and fight again with your tongue hallelujah and he began to say unto them this day is this scripture fulfilling your eyes and all bear him witness and wander at the which proceedeth out of water that was what coming out of the mouth of jesus relax put your seatbelt on moving the airplane to the airport let no corrupt communication proceed out of your water you can kill somebody because you don't know which power you have have you seen you say you want to see and the man get in the accident [Music] but that which is water to use of water daddy man minister what unto them that's what you should use your tongue for hallelujah amen the bible said but fornication and all uncleanness and covetousness covetousness let it not be one's name among you as becoming sent neither water no no which are not but but rather giving water that's what abraham was doing remember last sunday but now he also put off this anger rough mannis blasphemy filthy out of y'all lord help me the horses the bible says here i will instruct thee and teach thee in the way which that shall go i will guide thee with man eyes be it not as though or as the which have no whose must be in with a beat and lest they come james says in verse 3 we put bits in horse's mouth that they may obey us and we turn about their whole body in other words when we get their mouth we can move them whichever direction we want even if it's a fight the bombarding the horse will continue to go because he's breeder the one who won who's on him want to go to war so the horse is using the intelligence of the one that is there to accomplish his will because the horse is brother ever care now uh david is saying that when they put a beat on horse's mouth it's not only to obey him but to also bring the horse closer [Music] whose mouth must be held in with beat and brother lest they come we want a horse close to you breathe out his mouth he's going to come closer and then he's going to obey then you can control him what are you trying to say i'm going to close soon praise be the name of the lord by the bible says this and brother branham says this brother when i'm saying thank you brother neville good morning friends so happy to be here this morning and to have this introduction from the pastor that was very nice you know speaking of the horses you know putting their brother on them they know the work was so when god unloads you remember he's unloading with an investment for a new that's why to get you the new lord you need to control your tongue once he take a hold of the control of your tongue then they deposit the load the work brother of adam said putting the blood all over them they know the work was coming so once you put the brother on the horse they also understand that there is a load that i have to pick up well it is i'm just glad the lord made us a workhorse so we can work yet we are never never too tired to do something for the lord if he forced our lord to do it although being very water so the point here when you brother the tongue when you brother the mouth of a horse you bring him to obey you you bring him to come near to you and you want to give him a load that's what the which young ruler missed james said if any man among you seems to be religious and brother not his tongue but deceiveth his own this man religion is what so now you understand what it is to broaden your tongue where are you going the bible says in gems here chapter 3 he said behold we put bits in the horse's mouth that they may obey us and we turn about the whole body so to control the body you need to seize the tongue everybody so god also have a tongue everybody can everybody clear i'm heading straight to the airport god also have a tongue god has a mouth that's why the bible say men shall not live by but by every that proceeded out of the word so the mouth of god speak of the word [Applause] so if you can catch god in his mouth i'm gonna stop here if you can catch god in his tongue because a prophet is god's mouthpiece when the prophet speaks he's speaking god said the lord from god in other words the prophet gave you god's mouth [Music] if you can catch god's mouth or the message from the prophet if you catch it you can control the body of god [Applause] do you follow me do you follow me do you follow me [Music] i can tell you something i have to take it back many times because i'm just there your pastor can tell you things he has to take it back you can tell your neighbor things all your loved ones thinks you have to take it back but god cannot take his word [Music] the biggest mistake if i can call it a mistake because god doesn't make mistake but i'm trying to make a point the biggest mistake god can do is to let his word go to his child that's a mistake because god cannot take his word back again [Music] and if you understand that god wants to speak he can't say i'm sorry and you catch what he spoke [Music] god is in trouble i am trying to land the plane sooner you're gonna hear the the wheel of the airplane boom on the floor are you there god cannot take his word back he has to keep his word he has to keep it in order to be he cannot take back what he say he has to keep it his water [Music] oh my god i'm heading there oh my god god makes a promise god has to keep has to keep that promise oh i hope you see it if you could only understand church tonight and realize you would not be going from pillar to post or joining this church and that church you will not be seeking after the things of the world to bring pleasure to you you will not be seeking from one healing service to another you could take god where and know that it is hallelujah certainly when god makes a promise he cannot move from what in other words a dark word that's it that's it are you there he is duty bound to keep his water [Music] god told abraham i'm gonna make you a father of many nations through who isaac in other words isaac will have children and there will be children and there will be children and there will be children isaac is maybe 13 years old god say take isaac go in the mountain kill him if they say to you oh i need to check that revelation [Music] abraham look he say kill isaac and something told him you remember he told you your isaac will have children right

heavenly father lord we are approaching you again humbly father thanking you for everything you have been doing for us that you such a great god that they carry them have to cover their faces cover further the hand cover their feet and to hear us describing you the way we are describing you they probably are amazed but we understand because we are your children we can approach you and call you papa god [Music] you came down in human flesh so that the god of the old testament that nobody could approach not even in the mountain if an animal could touch the mountain he should be killed but through you a prostitute could approach you and not only approach you touch your feet and wash them and wipe them without you even you moving without even any death until the religious world look and send and condemn you to be a sinner but they never understood that only a child can approach that way and you came to rescue those souls father this morning you spoke to us about our tongue you spoke to us about your own tongue and you spoke to us about the temperance you spoke to us about the control of our body lord we're so glad because your prophet says that it is not the temperance that we were born with it because our birth we was a mess to begin with but it's a temperance that is coming from the holy spirit the temperance that is god given that is birth into us without any effort lord because the spirit itself is a gift it's an unmerited grace lord that you came to our way and to save us our poor sinner lord like we were wretched in our ways of life and in our behavior and attitude lord but the god who is reaching mercy father you drop down and rescue us for the dart of the devil and father so that we can be the righteousness of god lord i'm praying for this church i'm praying for your children i'm praying for those that will be streaming lord father or maybe they are streaming right now or those that will catch up later that father may you granted unto them that temperance may you give them lord father may you birth that ability that virtue into them that will help them control their tongue because the devil has been using their tongue to bring trouble in their life they have been confessing things speaking things not knowing lord that the course of their life has been put in jeopardy because of their problem their own confession but now lord father upon the blood of the atonement i pray that every word every confession that was spoken to your children before this day that was negative in their life maybe they donate consciously or unconsciously father maybe they've done it because they were pushed into anger into wrath they say things that were not correct and they are victim of their suffering today because of the things that are spoken upon the power of the lord jesus christ we break all those curses we break all those powers may further those chains of darkness be completely turned loose from their life may further you give them a tongue of a ready rather lord like david who could say that my heart is indicted with good mother may you feel them with good words that they can speak life to their children life to their family life to their loved one life to their job life to their business life to their health those that are struggling regardless of what they are struggling may they be positive in their talk may further you help us father catch lord the mind of the spirit and be able like abraham be able like the roman centurion be able like the syrophoenician woman to be able to take you at his at your word and father to bring you so that we can get the full benefit of that which you die for on calvary father thank you for giving us this service father we commit everything that was spoken unto the hand may the holy spirit continue to water this world and bring it to fruition we committed vendor the reception the memorial of sister gene tonight and to the hand may nothing be spoken in that memorial but that which is positive that which can edify that which can grant that which can be a blessing to somebody father you the god that broke the that close the mouth of the lion close the mouth of everyone who will try to speak a word out of order father i pray and i claim it in the name of jesus christ bless your children touch those that are sick in the body may you heal them may you rescue those that need to be
