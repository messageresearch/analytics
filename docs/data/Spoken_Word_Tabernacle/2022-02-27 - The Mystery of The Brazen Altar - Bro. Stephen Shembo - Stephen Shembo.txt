shame we can't record it but we had a really really joyous time it was so edifying if you want to make it even better sit next to brother kalima i did and i i am a better person for it because it's we were catching revelations at the same time and just feeding off each other as brother stephen was speaking and the others and it's just a wonderful time so let's sing a little bit and let's enjoy ourselves let's till the soul and let's get ready for the word to be planted in our hearts amen amen [Music] amen hallelujah he redeemed me i've been born again to win yes i thank god he justified me of him i'm a new creation i'm a brand new man all things i've passed away i've been born again more than a conqueror that's who i am i'm a new creation i'm a brand new man sing it again now yes i thank god he justified me of his fullness have we all received of him i'm a new creation i'm a brand new man things are passed away i've been born again more than a conqueror that's what i am i'm a

protect me by myself [Applause] yes lord look down on me [Music] and [Music] oh precious jesus oh hallelujah hallelujah i know i started you know this situation in ukraine which you know we're keeping our brothers and sisters in prayer but and and it may be the beginning of the very end and i've been kind of thinking about it and you know people are forming alliances and allegiances you know so i thought maybe this morning we could sing i pledge allegiance to the lamb [Music] because everything outside of these four walls and everything outside of jesus christ is going to do what it's going to do and we have to stay in him and we have to so we can confess through this song this morning and you know some of these songs i mean we can't do it without him so let's sing to him this morning and re-re-pledge our allegiance to uh to the land this morning amen hallelujah it's a very good song y'all sing with me i don't do it the same justice that brother fred used to hallelujah and i will seek to honor his command i pledge allegiance to the land now i have heard how christians long ago were brought before [Music] they were told that he would spare their lives if they would renounce the name of christ but one by one they chose to die the son of god they would not deny like [Music] i can almost hear their voices ring i let her lead us to the land with all my strength [Music] [Applause] [Music] i is allegiance to the land [Music] now the years have come and the years have gone but the cause of jesus still goes on now our time has come hold to count the cause to reject this world to embrace the cross and one by one let us live our lives for the one who died to give us life till the trumpet sounds on that mighty day let us proudly stand and boldly say i pledge allegiance to the land with all my strength with all is [Music] bore my shame who took my place and he bore my pain i will seek to honor his command i pledge allegiance to [Music] let's sing it one more time [Music] i [Music] is [Music] i pledge [Music] to the land with all my strength with all my [Music] i pledge allegiance [Music] hallelujah let's give him a big [Applause] there's been some photographs where christians are hiding out in the subways over there and they're singing christian songs in ukraine i know we have many brothers and sisters over there one of our prayer requests is to remember them and russia because there's a lot of russians that are not going along with what's going on so we'll bring that up in just a minute last week we had two birthdays that we did not get to recognize no brother polycarp some sun came up but brother isaac also had a birthday last week and we got to witness that amen amen amen amen praise the lord he turned i think the big one five was it not 15 years now sister teresa also i learned last night at our fellowship see now this brother sam let it slip out last night he had a promise last week not to mention it not last night so [Laughter] she had a birthday last week as well amen hallelujah and if i'm correct i think sister jerusha had one recently and sister yocky beth has one now or something okay so i think they're elsewhere with those does anyone else have one this week or oh really okay edie friday you know what i'm thinking right okay okay brother seth was this today or what is it today oh that's right it's the 29th of february we

brother seth and his wife amen because it's a joint birthday i'm sure it is in my house because when somebody has a birthday i get the cake too okay all right so i do have some prayer requests and i don't want to take away from those i mention our ukrainian brothers and sisters and our russian brothers and sisters and we could probably extend that to poland and belarus and just all around the

us we're still working on it and the parking lot looks very good with that landscaping so the trustees great job [Applause] and one more last thing continue to remember the believers in ukraine in prayer if you were in the midst of that you will be looking for somebody to pray for you so remember them they're riding a mister they caught in the midst of something they didn't start they didn't wish to be there but they just ride in the middle of it so that the lord can keep the families and keep the churches there amen all right let's go to our scriptures and those that are working on the computer just stay alert whenever it's a code to make sure you pull it or a slide somebody just reported to me that sometime they bring the code a little bit later and then they'll kind of lose focus so just blend with me in the spirit amen let's go to exodus chapter 27. i hope the atmosphere on the outside did not affect you if he did so you know where you are at right if that atmosphere the rain affected you you know where you are that's between you and the lord oh my god yeah some people just wait for any excuse then they out oh they say did you hear the god's price went up 10 cents then no church no good out of court exodus chapter 27 if you're there you can say amen oh my god verse 1 and you shall make an altar of mood all right so we're talking about an altar of shitty mood all right let's continue you shall make an altar of shitty mood five cubit long you might be seated and five cubit broad in other words this altar look like a box are you with me the altar look like a square everybody okay so you have five cubit here five cubic there five cubit here five cubic there in other words the length and the width everything is five cubic we have five five five five it looks like a square a box and you shall make the horns oh no the altar shall be four square everybody got it now it's clear and the height thereof shall be three cubit so we got a number and another number here which is the height of the old the altar and the height is three we have five five five and we got three everybody clear amen verse two and you shall make the horns of it upon the four corners thereof so there is it's a square we got one two three four corners and every corners have a horn so in total we got four horns amen and you shall make the horn of it upon the four corners thereof its horn shall be of the same and you shall overlay it with water so all these things are covered with brass that's why they call this altar the brazen brazen altar it is all made out of brass amen blessed be the name of the lord verse 3 and you shall make its pain to receive its ashes and its shovels and its basin and its flesh hook and its fire paints all the vessels thereof you shall make of water everything made out of brass not gold here and you shall make for it a crate of network of brass and upon the net shall you make four brazen rings in the four corners thereof so you have a ring somewhere here and you have another ring somewhere there and another ring somewhere over there and a ring over here everybody clear and verse 5 and you shall put it under the compass of the altar beneath that the net may be even in the midst of the altar i know this is greek for you just relax we're going to get there just soak it amen and you shall make staves you already understand steve's now for the altar staves of city mood and overlaid them with brass so those two rings on this side and two ring on the other side were to put the stave right there so somebody can carry the altar and they can move with it everybody okay so you got a ring a ring and then you put the stave in the ring so they can carry it amen verse seven and the staff shall be put into the rings now it's clear and the stave shall be upon the two side of the altar to do what to carry the altar so this altar is made everything here is overlay by brass that's why they call it the brazen altar it's made five cubit five cubic it's four square and the height is three cubit and we got four horns in the hog in the altar so we got number three number four and number five everybody okay verse eight hollow with board shall you make it as it was showed you in the mount so shall they make it in other words this altar that moses is making here is not something that never existed before anybody okay moses saw this altar somewhere everybody okay he saw this altar in heaven everybody okay and then he's reproducing that altar on the earth so we got two altars one in heaven one ear the earth one altar in heaven and another one on earth and on earth it's made out of brass everybody okay let's go to isaiah 53. i hope you're getting where we're going but maybe somebody's still stuck in the brazil note what is going on again i didn't write the bible it's the big boss who wrote the bible amen isaiah 53 if you're there you can say amen it's a little bit loaded so just relax and let me unload the cargo okay we only have one service don't sleep i know you are verse 1 who has believed our report and to whom is the arm of the lord revealed this is talking about jesus christ now for he shall grow up before him as a tender plant and as a root out of a joy ground he has no form no nor calmliness and when we shall see him there is no beauty that we should desire him it's not something beautiful verse 3 he is despised and rejected of man a man of sorrows you think you got trouble you got you you think you're going through trials in your life look at this man predestinated to be like this program to be like this he is despised and rejected of man a man of sorrow and acquainted with grief that is his deadly meat brother branham said when he was walking people were taking ripened fruit and then throwing him amen and we hid as he wear our faces from him he was despised and we steam him not surely he has borne our griefs despite everything despite how we despised him and everything and carried our sorrow so your grief your sorrow what you were supposed to go through amen yet we did esteem him stricken smitten of god and afflicted but in spite of all of this he was wounded for our your grief your sorrow your transgression not his transgression but yours your transgression he was bruised for our water so when you do something wrong that you already know it's wrong and you're still doing it it's going toward christ you're not hurting yourself you're hurting jesus christ that's why when brother branham had the vision of jesus christ every time brother branham was sinning his sin went and struck jesus christ and the blood came out of him hallelujah he was bruised for our iniquity how many iniquities one plural the chastisement of our peace your chastisement you should be the one whooped everybody the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his straps not one whiplashes we are here so when they torture him it is a benefit for you verse 7 he was oppressed and he was afflicted yet he opened his mouth on facebook he was oppressed and he was afflicted yet he opened not his mouth you remember yesterday when you're oppressed when you're angry the seventh seal silence everybody okay he opened up his mouth he's brought us a lamb to the slaughter and as a sheep before her shears is dumb so he opens not his mouth everybody okay job to verse 10 don't sleep this morning i can see you verse 10 yet he pleased the lord to bruise him how can he be a pleasure to bruise somebody he was put i'm sorry to bruise him he has put him to grief when you shall make his soul an offering for water not only iniquity but also sin if you look at that scene is it plural it's what and sin is what you see why it's singular because everything else is the attribute that is coming from it and back here so he have to go to the root and get the root then the whole trees is now amen when you shall make his soul an offering for sin he shall see his seed he shall prolong his days and the pleasure of the lord shall prosper in his hand you already got a picture here of an innocent man who's suffering because of somebody else let's go to luke chapter 18. our first reading we're talking about the brazen altar our second reading we're talking about somebody who's suffering judgment because of a guilty but that person who's not guilty he's just been going through the slaughter because of somebody else so there's he was streaking off god going to the slaughter everybody here let's go to luke chapter 18 verse 9 then we pray if you dare you can say amen first man and he spoke this parable to certain some people which trusted in themselves how many people here trust in themselves you're the only one that knows everything you are right in everything that you do everybody does and understand you it's only you jesus is talking to you i know you're not going to raise your head and he spoke this parable to certain which trusted in themselves that they were righteous that's a big problem a very big problem looking at yourself like i'm right they are bad the denomination the denomination you can't even live their christian life and you're pointing to the denomination amen and despise others i am not like so-and-so what are you talking about jesus verse 10 two men went up into the temple to pray they were going into the temple to do what the temple and prayer we know the altar of essence okay the one a pharisee looking good on the outside long dresses and everything and the other republican you look at him a crook because he usually comes with iras i'm not talking about the irs people the irs in that time anybody okay because they were tax collector verse 11 the pharisees stood and prayed thus with himself this is the prayer of a pharisee god i thank you that i am not as admins are what a prayer what a prayer extortioner so probably he was looking at the republican over there extortioner unjust i don't know if this republican went to his home to get taxes so he got upset on him so maybe he was in the church looking at him maybe praying loud so the republican can heal anybody here extortioner in the temple of god unjust adulterer or even as this water so he was looking at somebody else when he was praying making sure that person understand really well how he can speak english very well professional english everybody here i've fast twice in the week so when you sit down and you talking to these people they always have something to brag about themselves they usually do that in a humble way you know brother not to say anything but i was fasting last week really really you ain't fooling nobody everybody okay i fast twice in the week i give tithes no problem with church of all that are possessed what a prayer let's go to the public inside what are you telling god go ahead and tell him that the pharisees are devouring the houses of the widows tell him that the hypocrite you saw them in a movie theater tell god also because he's shooting at you go ahead and shoot back let's see what a pharisee does the republican does the certain and the publican standing a far off is not even close why is he standing afar off but the other one is approaching even examine yourself amen there's publicans standing afar off you already know where he is in the tabernacle okay he already understood his position so he doesn't want to play a game with god anybody here would not lift up so much as his eyes to heaven so he's conscious of something this one is not conscious of something it takes the word of god to zero him then to open what he's doing because he's fooling somebody he's an actor but branham said the word pharisee means an actor somebody who played church anybody care but smut upon his breast so we saw just a man like this yes saying god be water merciful to me a water so one person the pharisee in the temple in the presence of god he sees that he is righteous and the scripture described to us that this righteousness is not the righteousness that god told him but it's the righteousness that he viewed himself according to his own perception that he's righteous it's a self-made righteousness but the publican on the other side when you take him to the temple he's afraid and when he get in the temple he doesn't want to even look on the outside if he didn't want to look at the heaven where were they ate somebody got it where the only place you can see the heaven in the temple is where did i lose somebody so both of these are in the outer court in the time of prayer everybody okay when this one say lord have mercy on me because i'm what in the presence of god all that comes to him i'm a sinner he doesn't see anything that he can prove to god that he's righteous when he looked at himself he said there's nothing about me all i'm going to tell you i am a sinner in other words if you need to kill me go ahead and kill me but the other one is looking he say i am righteous remember i fast twice a week remember i'm not like this one i am not an extortionist i'm not like this one he's pulling something to god both of them in the same spot everybody okay let's go to verse 14. i tell you this man went down to his house how ah you got it so where is justification is he complicated did brother brother never give you the scripture once again the message is always perfect with their bible always remember that even if you don't see it yet remember remember that when brother branham says something always perfect [Music] not the man william marion branham but the ministry of god in william branham always perfect so the other quote produce justification oh glory to god i get so excited it's already in and i tell you he's already prepared blessed please again i tell you this man there should be a way we can pull that up probably okay thank you and i tell you this man went down to his house justified rather than the other for everyone that exhaust himself shall be beast and he that does what so when you get in the other court you must be humble you must be very humble in the other court everybody okay shall be humble and he that humbles himself shall be what now my question this man was praying when he was praying he recognized himself as a sinner and jesus said he humbled himself versus the other one that exalted himself by his own righteousness and then when he went home he went justified what was in the other court that justified him what is in the other court that make you justify that when you leave the other court he was not in the holy place because only the priest entered it he was not in the holiest because only the high priest entered there but in the other court that man can go back home like he never done anything since he was born what is in the other code that gives him the power turn to isaiah 6 and let's pray oh my god blessed be the name of the lord stay put don't sleep because you might miss something especially those that have a tendency to listen one time and they got everything off they go home i already listened to it i got everything i remember everything ask him question after two weeks make sure this is not something you take and you forgot you take and you forgot this is something that is building you up the more you eating you're growing you're growing you're growing you're growing until one of this day it's gonna be between you and god let's pray heavenly father lord we are approaching you again humbly father this morning thanking you for your grace for your love your mercy and everything you have been doing for us father thank you for giving us another opportunity to gather together around the revealed word of the hour father i have done what every mortal that you give ability to read can read and bother and further when it comes to interpret the scripture no one can do it only the holy spirit father therefore i'm humbling myself and i pray that you move me completely away may you come and

the omega of this service as we ambly ask it in the name of jesus christ amen everybody ready blessed be the name of the lord my subject this morning is the mystery of the brazen altar brother stephen are you starting another series because we are in a roof no i am not starting another series everybody okay normally the sermon should be the four phases of roof the brazen altar everybody okay but in to make your reference easy because two months or three months down the road somebody will come and say when did he preach about the brazen altar so you can go straight ahead and pull it and see it clearly because we already talked about the lever so we want to make sure everything is clear and easy for you to access so the mystery of the brazen altar you can pick that one or the four faces of roof or roof at the brazen altar everybody okay now when we talked about a roof i reminded you on wednesday that roof we want to blend the roof with the tabernacle everybody okay and the tabernacle have three places you should be now very very familiar with this we have the other court we have the holy place and we have the holiest or the most holy everybody okay then we found out that the stages of roof because we started with the tabernacle and we wanted to blend roof with the tabernacle and we found out that rufus first was at his mother's home and over there they were all under a dollar tree everybody here then roof moved from his mother home all the way to the house of elimelech everybody from the tribe of judah by marriage anybody care anybody okay so by getting into the house of judah judah which is the door roof was already get access into the camp of israel everybody okay but yet she is not in the tabernacle yet anybody okay then we found out that at the death of the husband of roof ruth moved from there all the way to the road towards uh toward judah the road or the way back and in this road that's where you take this you make decision everybody okay blessed be the name of the lord so to move from the camp from the marriage or from the door that you enter in in the message maybe you enter because of marriage maybe you enter because of a relationship maybe you enter following your friend or maybe you were just born in a message and that is your religion to move from there the husband of roof must die who knows the name of the husband of roof somebody did the homework from moab to bethlehem this journey was initiated by the death of marlon in ruth chapter 4 verse 10 the bible says moreover roof the more bodies the wife of who marlon everybody clear now so don't say brother stephen saying now we remember that when we talk about the names brother branham said naomi means pleasant elimelech was her husband means worship and when you take naomi and elimelech he give you a pleasant worship that was the family but malone brother branham say that one means sickness and kalyan or kilion means weary gloomy and sadness but the husband of ruth was marlon meaning that roof was married to sickness any problem did i lose any anything and we know that roof is a type of the gentile brand you already know that right or the gentile church everybody okay where are you going brother branham says this that i want to say this before i start preaching the greatest need of healing tonight and the sickest body that are north in all of the world is the body of the lord duh everybody okay so far and ruth was married born with sickness oh it is horribly sick it is broke up and scattered he needs a healing may god send the holy spirit in such a power till the whole body of class will be brought together bound with love and unity until then you will see things happen that you never thought of before jesus will come and it will be over everybody okay brother branham said that there is more to the ministry than divine healing that was the first poll the sickest body i know of tonight is the so-called body of jesus christ that's ruth married to sickness he needs spiritual healing everybody okay not natural healing there is only one bomb or one medication that i know of die will heal and that is the so according to brother branham the only thing that can heal roof have to be the word everybody okay and that is the sick body that we want to stand up in the strength and the vitamin power of the gospel and that is why i use much of the time now in trying to strengthen the church by the water so ruth was married to marion married to sickness and in order for roof to go to the second marriage of boaz according to romans chapter 7 verse 1 all the way to 3 your first husband must die everybody care because if your first husband is not dead and you be married to another husband you completely committed adultery in other words the first thing that brought you into the message must die let me start it again if you holding onto this message based on the fact that you were born from the parent that believed the message dark cold need to die [Music] that foundation needs to be destroyed if you are in this message because you follow a husband or because you follow a woman or because you follow a friend or you follow the movement of the peers the relationship that foundation must die in other words if this is what you're hanging on to in the message you are not in the message yet you are just in the camp of the message you don't drink you don't smoke you don't commit adultery you don't go to the nightclub you're just in the camp but you are not in the tabernacle yet everybody okay so far all right and we found out that when the husband died both of these women ruth and oprah went on the road to the going back on onto the land of judah and on that road they must take a decision but branham says this brother branham says that we have four different phases of roof we have roof deciding we have roof making a decision roof serving roof resting and roof rewarded so number one we are in the roof deciding number two she have to serve number three she have to rest and number four roof have to be rewarded of her work brother branham said roof making the decision roof after she made her decision then roof is serving then roof is resting then roof is rewarded and we found out that decisions are very important because brother branham preached the power of decision everybody okay then brother branham preached the time of decision and then brother branham preach the results of decision it is free you can listen to it so decision have power everybody okay and there is a time whether you like it or not you must take a decision because god will rock your boat everybody okay and the decision you will take will have some result in your life either it's gonna be a positive result or it's gonna be a negative report that's why brother branham said whatever you're living today is a result of the decision you took five years ago what kind of life are you living today work on of decision are you making every day it is shaping your life hallelujah brother branham said there is four stations or phases or junction in roof and boas he said first she had to decide whether she was going to she was going to go into this land or not with naomi she had to make a decision then after she got there the next thing she had to do was to serve in the field of boaz not any kind of field out there barefooted gleaming behind the reapers serving so he was not yet done by just taking a decision the next step was on everybody and then after she had found grace in boar's side by doing the work she have to do certain things to gain the favor of boaz you are serving ever here then she had to wait because she already got degradation till bowers done the king's men redemption redeemership to take back all naomi lost in order to bring in roof the moabite and the next stage is roof water everybody cares so far so we were dealing with decision and like we said decision is very important and we also told you that decision cannot be made by emotion remember even on wednesday brother bruce emphasized on that one everybody here brother branham say you say oh brother branham i have tried that lots of time but wait you never fully made up your mind you might just be under and lead the emotion of some sort but if you really make up your mind and make a decision christ is going to receive you hallelujah let me continue because what emotion can be destroyed by reasoning all it takes is somebody to give you some crazy website or youtube links and you are off everybody here brother branham said as i have said a while ago lord maybe you have put a stumbling block in somebody's way about these altar calls brother branham was not against altar call anybody here but brother branham was really rigid about altercall what was going on in the article that brother branham didn't like everybody here brother branham said until they were begging and persuading people to go up you don't beg people in churches do you hear me if somebody one of god let them go you don't persuade people to come in the message because one of these days they're going to leave you brother branham say and when we return back next year we found them a two-fold more child of hell than there was to start with how can you come in the altar and you supposedly giving your life to jesus christ then five years later they found you in the nightclub everybody okay how can they come except you convince them and convict them the great holy spirit everybody so far brother branham continues he said i noticed the other night in that great famous meeting of one of our great renowned brothers in california and i noticed in that meeting as those people come down young water you thought they coming at the altar the lord touched them we see this all over the convention somebody will preach before you see young people a long line all of them coming at the altar you say praise the lord this is over next year they're in the altar next year they're in the altar but the publican was in the altar one time and when he left that was it what is going on brother branham saying i notice young teenager children i admire their brother for his great stand anybody would it's a wonderful sermon if you position see what takes uh what place he's taken in the last day you will too but what is wrong brother branham and as i notice those people coming down to the altar to make a water so that all there is a place for decision girls chewing chewing gum boys punching one another so when they say come to the earth you see young people going on you better go back and go sit brother say in other words they're coming at the altar joking they're coming at the altar without respect chewing gums [Music] why is that how can you preach and a young person or an adult is coming to the altar playing games it is because they never understood the mystery of that altar anybody okay brother branham say people laughing joke lack of respect and laughing sometimes you are preaching you see young people laughing hallelujah that is not the way to come godly water in other words brother branham is saying that when you are approaching the altar the altar is not a place that makes you laugh the altar is a dangerous place it is a place of sorrow i have to teach this so if you did your conversion wrong you need to go back and correct everything everybody okay you must come under conviction not the preacher persuading you or pulling you or telling you about your mother who died your father who died your uncle who died your neighbor that was a good person that's not the ground everybody here god send us an old-fashioned pentecostal holy ghost revival that shall bring sin to the root and bring conviction to men and women so the minister must preach plan call sin by its name regardless if the person is a friend to the pastor or not [Music] hallelujah brother branham continue and the people are not even accepting it sincerely they are joking they are laughing lack of respect and no sincerity coming to the altar why should we approach the altar with sincerity why do we need to approach the altar not laughing why do we have to come in the altar crying why the other night in los angeles at the great rally seen a hundred times 100 come up to make decisions at the altar young people again coming up teenagers punching one another and chewing chewing gum and pulling one another's hair your hair looks good going to the altar acting coming up to make a decision no wonder it is a babylon [Music] no wonder it is a sodom the whole thing is ready to be born when you come to the altar laughing joking punching one another without sincerity you got your result will be a confusion babylon or you're gonna find yourself in unclean living in sodom you find yourself in confusion you find yourself in unclean living go back again check how did you go to the altar brother branham say how you going to backslide you might backslide but you can be lost and if you stay in that state you show that you didn't have it in the beginning but if you are a child of god the worshiper once purge has no more conscience of sin say hebrew that is true so you can be a christian you can have the holy ghost and run out and live in the world how many people have the holy ghost in the message how many people the holy ghost making you do stuff that you do everybody that holy ghost doesn't stop you when you're paying the hotel bill that holy ghost doesn't stop you from not taking your pants off you don't have it if you love the world the things of the world the love of god is not even in you so you are just listening to a false sound somewhere the devil got you all what like the pharisee anybody care but if you examine your life by the word of god and it shows you are living right down that bible page then you get water take the word of god examine yourself how you living then you're gonna tell whether you have it or not brother branham continued to give us more light brother branham says tapping it up with roof roof deciding roof serving roof resting brother branham said deciding was justification because we found out that the other court was justification the holy place was sanctification and the holiest was the baptism of the holy ghost now brother branham is saying that roof when she left the house of elimelech and when she was on the road to judah and she had to make a decision brother branham said that was the stage of justification in other words roof was already into the tabernacle in the other court anybody okay he said serving making herself ready sanctification resting was with the holy spirit until the wedding supper comes so roof deciding is your justification anybody okay roof serving is your sanctification roof resting is the baptism of the holy spirit and roof rewarded is going into the rapture the coming of the lord but the bottom say the church come through john wesley justification i mean luther justification through john wesley's sanctification through the pentecostal the baptism of the holy ghost and now resting waiting everybody care for the what the coming of the lord which is your reward everybody here so now we got roof deciding and deciding is justification and justification happened in the world to other court just like we saw the publican and the pharisee justification happened where and the other code so roof now is at the other court now let's get roof inside the tabernacle when you look at the tabernacle and you enter the tabernacle there is two things that are there in the other court the other court have only two furniture the first is the present altar and the second one is the lever and we already talked to you about the level so when you enter from the east the first things that roof sees is the altar that's where roof was deciding so the road back to judah was already roof at the altar right there so when roof left the house of elimelech the place they were living with naomi and step on the road going back to judah she was not in judah yet but she was on the road to judah that spot there was an alter right there because ruth would have to make a decision and orpah must make a decision everybody okay so far did we lose somebody everybody care praise be the name of the lord so when you enter you got an altar here and after the altar we got to order into a eleven and we told you that in the altar this is where you repented then you are water baptized that's why peter enacts 2 38 peter said repent everybody okay and be baptized in the name of jesus christ for the remission of sin you don't receive the holy ghost here then you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost the tabernacle in attitude 338. can i start it again repent be baptized in the name of jesus christ and you shall it's in the future you shall it is coming up in the future in other words you have more step to move on until you receive the holy ghost so what happened at the altar is not done yet you still have to move forward you stop at the altar and you thought you got the holy ghost that's why you are struggling the way you struggle everybody okay so we found out that we already talked about the level but what is wrong with the altar because we need to understand what is in the altar because if you don't understand the altar you will keep laughing in church you will keep joking in church you will keep coming here and respectfully and with that sincerity playing in the instrument singing right here and living like a devil i am gonna tighten up to the point where if we don't even have a song special that would be good and as long as your life is getting clean and back here you cannot live wrong and come here to sing you cannot live wrong and come here to play instrument you cannot live wrong and come here to back up the instrument if your life is not where it's supposed to be i will respect you more if you stay sitting there hallelujah everybody okay do you still love me either way jesus loves me hallelujah so when we look at this altar what is going on in this altar brother branham say as usual when one regard a verse superficially he comes up with a superficial understanding and when the people don't understand the power of this altar that's why they play games in the church the mystery of the brazen altar everybody okay what is going on with this altar let's go to isaiah chapter six let me unload this cargo somebody told me that i can move this praise god everybody okay praise god i won't tell you his name before you jump on him you would have one taught him let's go to uh isaiah 6 you there you can say amen in the years that king uzziah died [Music] elimelech died marlon died kingdom died isaiah if you go to the message influence was so connected to this king this king was the mentor of isaiah you follow me in other words the relationship between god and isaiah was based upon this king everybody okay and god slew the king because the preacher got more power in the heart than god brother branham said when a man leaves the world leave him and the reason why people cannot live is in their heart they got more connected with the pastor versus with the great shepherd brother branham say if you need the quote that god allows some time pastor to make mistake so he can shake your faith away from the person may god protect me under his blood [Music] do you follow me amen that king usaid look as a great man how can you leave the message and me get in trouble because of you you leave the church and me stop praying because you left the church you might as well leave the church my relationship with god is not based on you whether you like me or not that's not my problem whether you stay or go that's not my problem but you see people if their relationship if he's a friend to brother charles hamilton if he gets a problem with brother charles hamilton he leaves the church so brother chose hamilton is the church so you are staying in this church because of brother charles hamilton you might as well live how can i destroy my own life because of brother charles hamilton brother charles hamilton doing his own things and me stopping from going to church because of him [Music] why you don't come to church they gossip about me the gossipers still come to church you injuring yourself while you stop going to church i was so disappointed with what happened the man that disappoints you is living his life and you are destroying your own spirituality for somebody who doesn't care about what you're doing [Music] so in the years this king i said i was a big fan to him a big body everything he looks at this king everything he looks at this king this king does this isaiah copy i say a copy i say a copy god saying no problem that's his first husband god slew the first husband isaiah lost the gps he went quickly in the temple disappointed i didn't think these things will happen to us it is so bad god said that's why i want you ever here and thank you when isaiah was a friend to king uzziah isaiah saw himself as a good man [Music] the relationship of isaiah and king uzziah gave isaiah a self-confidence that everything in his life was good because he's a friend to the king because he's there with the king because he has a first place with the king so therefore my life is good if he needs money he just called the king or text him and the king said go to the treasure go get money that's my body no problem everything in life going good a beautiful church a beautiful people beautiful family everything beautiful so my life is good i don't need anything i'm waiting for the coming of the lord god said no problem i know what to do isaiah slay the first husband destroy that relationship shake and rock the boat and when they shook the boat and when the king was dead he brought isaiah into the temple [Music] a trial and a difficulty that is pushing you closer to god is necessary if you must lose a job to be here on church it is good for you to lose that job because that job become a hindrance for you you cannot come to church two months three months four months six months because of the job and the day you're gonna leave that job not even the manager will come to visit you but there is a present help in the time of trouble that no matter what happen he will always be there but you are neglecting jesus christ because of your paycheck [Music] church i'm not going to be in front of god with your blood and i keep telling you everybody okay so god slaying this king bring isaiah to the temple god said this is the perfect moment that he's trouble his mind is puzzled he's no longer thinking about the benefit that he has with the king now he can listen to me then god open up the vision you ready let's go to the scripture now i saw saw the lord lift up upon the throne so not only did he enter the natural temple do you follow me god took isaiah from the earthly temple about here and transfer isaiah to a heavenly temple or the true tabernacle we already explained you this when isaiah entered there he saw the throne remember in heaven there is no curtain the curtain where on the earth in heaven when you enter you see everything all the way there and back here on the earth you have the first curtain you have the second character you have the gate you have the door then you have the curtain of the holy holy that's uh the one that was split into but in heaven when isaiah enter he look he can see the throne but we know on the earth the throne is on the holiest remember on the third part i look he saw the throne in other words isaiah entered into the presence of god everybody okay give me time please upon the throne high and lift up and his train we already explained you this these angels filled the temple isaiah looked he see a great king sitting and the temple filled with angels what is going on verse two above it stood the seraphim how many remember seraphim do you remember when we talked about in the mystery of the level the seraphim are the out of heaven over here you have livers in the heaven you have seraphim that's why i keep telling you how many are up to date with the sermon it's keep building one on top of the other if you lost it it's your problem above it stood that seraphim each one had six wings with two he covered his face with two he covered his feet with two he did fly and one cried to another and say holy when isaiah entered the message that the seraphim are giving is holly holly holy three times so when you enter the presence of god the first thing is holiness that's why the high priest have to wear something here that say holiness unto the lord we will get to that later on everybody here three times holy holy holy who is holy is the lord god of mighty three times perfection the whole earth is full of his glory and the post of the door moved and the voice of him that cried and the house was filled with water this man entering into heaven didn't he god giving him the great vision of the seven seal you hear me when he entered the seraphim spoke in other words they reminded him that remember holy holy here holy the one who's sitting there is holy three times respect here respect here respect here you cannot pray and when i say i heard that the temple is shaking what kind of a king is this yes anybody here verse 5 when isaiah saw that i say i turn around and i say i begin to speak let's see the speech of isaiah after the first husband is gone isaiah said why is me isaiah in the presence of god after the message of the seraphim the first thing that come to him he said woe not war to the people of israel [Music] not work to the preachers in the message not wow to the pastors word to me not somebody else not my wife not my husband not my father not my mother wow unto me personal relationship follow your wife you're going to go to hell with him follow your husband you're going to go to hell with him brother branham said if he tells you to do something contrary to the word you're not supposed to listen to it why are you doing this my wife said this my wife said continue the way you continue you're going to go to hell when he got there he said wow unto who me personal let's continue one to me for i am what i am doomed what did isaiah do isaiah thought he was watchers isaiah thought he was a prophet a prophet working with the king when they call him they said this is the prophet this is the preacher this is the but when he got in the presence of god [Music] he forgot that he was a prophet he even forgot his friend the king did you kill somebody did you drink beer isaiah because i am a man of water a prophet with unclean lips it can only be detected in the presence of god and the bible says out of the abundance of the water the mouth does what so if they're mad if the lips off as they were unclean what was going in the heart of isaiah everybody okay so isaiah in the presence of god begin to see where his error are [Music] you follow me all that god did was shine the light and god put a pose and god waited and isaiah himself begin to tell god it is here in other words the great physician is there what are you looking for ma'am good morning my name is dr so-and-so what brings you to my office it is you to tell him where the problem i is my problem is here a prophet with unclean lips hallelujah he says and i dwell in the midst of people with water in other words not only me god but my environment is bad that environment that you like that environment of so-called message believer that when you sit with them it doesn't progress you they are just there to feed you with stories with jokes with game and you think the good friend get in the presence of god and turn around and look at that environment again my eyes everybody seen have seen who the lord of hosts i saw the king everybody when he did that number one getting in the presence of god bring you into recognition that you are a sinner remember the publican the bible says this that in job 42 i have heard of thee by the hearing of ears but my eyes have done what remember isaiah also saw god when job saw god what did job say because job thought he was righteous everybody here job look he said what have i done to do i mean going like this i didn't do anything bad i was the one helping the widow i was the one doing this i was the one doing this i was the one doing this and the people came and began to accuse him you did this you did he said i don't know i have never done it and he got self-righteous god opened the door he said get in my presence when job enter in the presence of god he said you know i heard preacher preaching about him i heard the people talking about you but now it is not hearing anymore i am now seeing you but when i see you what did he do to job job say wherefore i do what i bought my wife in other words job is telling god when i saw you i begin to hate myself when brother branham went to the sixth dimension when he looked at his body they say go back he said no i don't want to go back again that body that you punched on whatsapp he said i bore myself i repent in dust and water just seeing the king how can you come in the altar chewing chewing gum when a prophet coming in the altar is crying by you coming at the altar you poking your friends do you see what brother branham was talking about do you see he said in luke when peter saw the miracle of jesus christ the bible said when simon peter saw it he fell down at the dead jesus knees saying depart from me for i am a water you playing with church let's go to verse six the bible says this then flew one of the waters when he acknowledged himself to be a sinner leave out move quickly because the judgment is there anybody okay you cannot stand in the presence of the king being a sinner something must be done to isaiah quickly because his state is not correct to see the lord what happened oliver understood that he needed help after confessing after recognizing and confessing his error they leave out of heaven move quickly what did deliver delivered move with the bible says this he flew one of the seraphim to me having a water it's burning is a life called cool if i bring a life call and i put it to you is that good how can you laugh at the author how can you play game at the altar because you never know what is going on in the altar he said a live call in his hand which he had taken with the water from off water everybody okay so when isaiah recognize and confess his sin and live out of heaven a seraphim stood up quickly and went straight to the altar which alter was that because we have the present altar and we also have the or the the golden altar which is the altar of essence but the bible said he went to the altar and when he went to the altar he took a tongue which is like a player and put and get a cold and come quickly to isaiah so the to clean up isaiah do you follow me you need the altar the fire from the altar are we are we getting together when he brought it from the altar verse seven and he laid upon his what why he didn't lay on his feet because isaiah told god where his problem was where is my problem it is in my mouth in your mouth fine they put a love code they say open their mouth right back here and they put it to your mouth a live call is that good why do you laugh why do you play why do you chew gum if that life can't hit your lip are you going to chew gum everybody care he said and laid it upon my mouth and said low this has touched your lips and your water so isaiah had iniquity he has things in his life that he was doing knowing that he was wrong a prophet a preacher in the message anybody here and your iniquity is water taken away and your water not only did he have iniquity but water is water so the altar can take away your iniquity oh the altar can purge your sin but to get the seraphim moving to you to clean you up you must understand how to approach the altar everybody okay let's go deeper into this altar the president everybody okay job god told moses let them make me a sanctuary that i made well among them according to all that i showed you after the pattern of the tabernacle and the pardon of water all the instrument or the furniture thereof even so shall you make it in other words whatever was in heaven was reproduced on the earth and back here now we are in the temple in heaven now in the message influence brother branham saying a messenger that is even closer to god you become his child on beyond the water brother branham says that when you pass the brazen altar that's when you become his child let's go slowly brother bottom say the seraphim is at the water so this altered [Music] that they took the cord life to purge isaiah was the president he has fire that can take your iniquity away or can take your sins away let's continue again brother barnum help me up brother branham say if you remember that's the seraphim actually the hebrew word is the that's why they leave out on the earth were burning stuff at the brazen altar they were reproducing what was going on there they were the one who offered water and what so the seraphim the seraphim hallelujah offered incense and sacrifice he says we already talked about the golden altar you remember that which is talking about their prayers but this one is talking about the brazen altar when they are killing the sacrifice but the seraphim does both of them keep calm we are soaring somewhere he said it is just a higher order of angels that makes way that makes the way for the who as long as there is a what remember who was sitting on the throne anybody okay and they seraphim especially this burner had a special office they stay right in the presence of water that's why when isaiah recognized himself as a sinner the one who's responsible to prepare a sinner and to move him into the presence of god move quickly but based on the stage of isaiah he took the president in other words isaiah the step you are you need to deal with the president altar you are in the other court brother brother say that seraphim is a mighty word there it's not an angel what it is it's a sacrifice burner he has something to do with the atonement because he offered the sacrifice the sacrifice is the sacrifice for atoning sin everybody here brother bonham said he offered the sacrifice to make way for the water what did i say i do when he repented what happened the seraphim moved now to clean him up so they can progress with him ever here they repented sinner to the throne of water everybody here isaiah saw the throne they said stop right there check your life here holy holy holy here i say i look and say i'm not holy lord be merciful on me i am an answer i am an unclean man i am a sinner god said that's fine since you recognize and you confess yourself to be a sinner now seraphim move on move on with what he is at the brazen altar he went to the brazen altar pulled alive and purged him everybody okay but the seraphim goes forward with the offering right in the presence of who a burner the offer of the prayer that has been made they burn their sacrifice where are we going brother stephen brother branham say but an angel went over to the altar where the sacrifice was burning and took a tongue and took a cold life hot coal off the altar and come and touch his lips and say now you are clean your sin is purged now go and water so nobody can preach because what the problem say a prophet in the new testament is a preacher nobody can handle the gospel if you have not been purged before brother the bottom say one of the engine went over to the brazen altar and took the tongue and reached over and got a call of living fire and run over to isaiah and press it in his mouth say now you are clean go speak the word isaiah was water the brazen altar is an altar that bring a change to your life but you are not at the throne yet what happened then we found out he confesses sin and just as soon as he has done it this great voice that has been speaking flew down took his hand took the tongue pick up a call place it upon his hand came laid upon isaiah's lips and cleans him where are you going brother stephen then what happened one of the caribbean went over to the altar and took the tongue pick up a lavco and put it on his hand not carry it a tongue now that's what denominational uh showing that's wrong but he put it in his head and laid in the prophet lips and said that iniquity iniquity what is iniquity if you're sleeping you step up there inequity is something that you know is wrong and still holding to it when you know your quits are wrong and you still hold to it that is iniquity but when he confessed that he was wrong there was a creasing water so when you get to the altar don't be like the pharisee don't show god how good you are hallelujah as soon as he confessed and cleansed then followed the commission first he had to confess then he had to be cleansed and now it is the water then come the cleansing here come the caribbeans brother branham said because he was ready to confess and confess that he was unclean because he had looked to some bishop the king uzziah or somebody for his example instead of looking toward who if that's the way you were in the message you need to go back to the altar everybody here and he cried and when he cried out oh is me for i have done wrong i have put my example my trust in a man and i see the order of the lord and he cleans him with a cause of fire now isn't it wonderful how the man recognized himself being a what and look how god did as soon as he recognized he was there he confessed to being uh confess his what and he saw what god did how he did it how he cleans him by the cause of fire not a declaration of creed bunch of beats not some historical affair he cleans him present tense with live water so when you get in the presence of god always acknowledge you are wrong everybody okay anybody okay that was in heaven let's go back now on to the earth everybody okay you want to go home in psalm 118 27 the bible say god is the lord this is david which has shown us light bind the sacrifice with cords even unto the water of the weapon so the brazen altar is not a happy place the brazen altar is a place when they are bringing the ship the ship is trembling because the bride's an altar speak of death somebody is going to die you cannot play you cannot going to the execution chewing gum you cannot be going to the executing punching one another everybody you doing that because you don't know what is going on brother branham say now the serpent on the pole represented sin already judged and he was made out of water and the altar is made out of brass now brass represents divine judgment not earthly judgment or mental judgment but divine water so the brazen altar is an author where the divine judgment of god must take place the mystery of the present altar brother branham say the present autumn was where the sacrifice was burnt was made of brass the president and it means that he was divine that is where the divine price was paid ever here here did not only kill the sacrifice every care but they burned the sacrifice in this altar on this altar this is where god apply his judgment and you pay the price right there at the altar what not any kind of price but a divine price the measurement of this altar is three on the height and if you look on the breath and the width everything is five in other words you have four fives there we know that five is the number of water and three is the number of water and we found that that grace is not in one place it goes into four places and pharaoh is the number of the earth you remember and it's a number of deliverance anybody here brother brother uh the bible in john chapter 1 the bible says that the law was given by moses but grace and truth came by who thank god buy what are you what through water and not of yourself it is what why not of what lest any man should everybody okay so when you approach the altar the president the president they have grace in every direction hallelujah where do you live from the north side or you live on the south side you live on the east side or you live on the west side there is grace for you at the president because because it's an author that was placed on the earth to bring deliverance to you everybody here so when you approach that altar you are approaching deliverance there is grace to clean you up and to bring you unto perfection you okay the bible says being justified where in the other court by what but faith comes by water we have water you can go home free through our lord who brother branham said you forgive me i never done it what you forgiving me about see for if but if i'm guilty then i can be forgiven but i'm still not just because i did it but the word justified is though you never water justified and the blood of jesus christ cleanses from our sin jesus saw from sin till it's put in the books of god for um of god's forgetfulness he's the only one that can do it so when you are approaching this altar on the west side whether you live in israel whether you're in america whether you're in europe whether in your south america or south africa wherever you are there is grace in this altar there is deliverance disorder if you approach this altar this altar will deliver a grace to bring you unto perfection then he sent another prophet to introduce another age and another lamb that was the lamb of god for all adam race that takes away the sin of the world soon as the lamb was nailed to his water so they brought an altar here that kills the lamb and burn the sacrifice and accomplish the divine judgment to pay the price was typifying the cross because at the cross the lamb of god was crucified then the lamb of god spoke in tongues there the lamb of god took the judgment because the chastesment of your peace was upon him and the divine press was paid then ever here so if you come guilty at the cross and you recognize your fault the cross has the power to purge you until you can go home and you can go free [Music] the bible says this that in colossians 2 that blowing out the handwriting of ordinances that was against who which was contrary to who he took it out of the way and did what so the brazen altar of the cross have a power to eliminate to erase to remove every accusation that is against you that's why roof that's why roof that's why roof when she left the house of an army she must enter by the president open because there were no demands there was a guest roof that said that no more about can enter into the congregation but when you go to the brazen altar they take the ordinance and they tear it down they nail it completely that's why roof could enter in israel and nobody has to speak anything her ordinances were now when she took her decision at the grass and altar everybody okay everybody okay because the shorter not only bring you grace because something was against you but he also bring you perfection hebrew 10 say for the love having the shadow of good things to come and not the very image of things can never with those sacrifices which they offer year by year continually make they come they come there on to what but for by one offering of jesus christ he has done water perfected how forever them that are water that's why that altar was three by five five that bring you grace four tells you about deliverance and when you get to the altar and you identify with that sacrifice and you recognize that you're a sinner and you confess your sin you humble yourself then that sacrifice perfect you one time forever then you are justified like you never done it to begin with and you can go home free the power of the brazen altar hallelujah so the fulfillment that's why roof have to enter there because there was an ordinance against the roof and that ordinance was that a moabite can never enter the congregation of israel ever here so the brazen author in the old testament was speaking about the cross so the cross was the true bazenote because this is where the judgment of god struck jesus christ and he paid the price and now you can go free everybody here if the judgment the ultra the president in heaven could free isaiah and remove his iniquity and he removed his sin if the president although ever here the one who come there is completely guiltless and go back home justified like the publican and the cross being the antitype of the true brazen altar made flesh so there must be power at the cross [Music] and because of the power they brought two fifths they brought roof and opera and they put them at the cross one was roof one was upper one feet from the left and one feet from the right side what happened now remember that when you are justified by faith i hope that explains it you are christian right then when you accept jesus as your personal savior you are a christian at that time i believe if you would die right then when you accept jesus as a savior i believe you are water because the blood will perfect you brother branham said that is what the dying water and the cross did water because at the cross the brazilian altar was made flesh and when the fifth understood by revelation that this is the president isaiah said when you are in the present hotel what do you do recognize yourself being water let's see what that thief say hallelujah one of the male factors which were rang rarely on him saying if that be christ saved herself oppa hey but the other answering rebuke him saying does not do what at the brazen hotel you must fear god seeing that are in the same water at the cross and we indeed water for we receive the water of our water but this man has done water and he said unto who the lamb but that one said the altar lord do whatever when what into the and jesus said unto him verily i say unto you one shall that be with me in water [Music] he got into the brazen altar he humbled himself he said father what i'm receiving now i am due for that it is just because i'm bad all i'm asking you remember me all i'm asking you is remember me i am not chewing gum i am not laughing i am not playing games i am not looking at my devil i am not looking at my father this is between me and you father remember me [Music] when jesus put the dna test he looked at him he saw the predestinated sin that is flashing like this there is something about the predestinated seed that humble themselves as their brazen altar because they understood that somebody paid the price for me somebody took my place somebody died for me jesus said not tomorrow not tomorrow today you're not going the same way if they knew you as a manufacturer go tell abraham go tell us here go tell all of him that i'm ah jesus give you permission get there i can see him knocking knocking at the door and abraham opened he said who is this lazarus say i was over there who i don't know who john the baptist said yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah we he was on the news all the time that was the fifth that was feeling he already took something at my mother the fifth said listen i don't have anything to argue i don't know what to tell you but there is somebody at the cross [Music] [Applause] there is somebody that took my past there is somebody that paid my price that person told me enter so make way i'm gonna enter not with my headphones but i'm gonna enter chilling up because i am clean they all didn't ordinance everything that was before me he never left at the cross hallelujah my record at the prisoner my record at the jail go at the cross you're gonna see that record over there you deal with the one at the cross not me hallelujah the mystery of the brazilian author brother branham said when they offered the little lamb took the little fellow and plucked up his throat and held his hand and feel it quivering dying and the blood going out to the charger that was thrown on as prayer went up on the blood and altar of sacrifice and judgment altar of water brass speak of water and that little lamb after he finally quit kicking he kick he kick he kick a kick and finally say father i return my spirit to the hand and he's dying innocent with spit and everything the worshiper standing there realized that he was his sin that did that that ought to have been him but the lamb took his place that is the brazen altar let me push if i can get here then they come to the field shelter the first salt is where they burn the sacrifice where the lord met them there in forgiveness of sin and cleansed them from all their unrighteousness at the burning altar the brazen altar burnt the beast and the blood from the beast so now my new year's message here at 12 30 it was in december 20 minutes till one but my advice is to you christian you who love god when you come to god bless although brass altar of judgment and you want to be born again just lay yourself upon them don't expect to pick up to pick up again you are going to die that is the end of you that was the end of roof because remember roof say naomi no more de morbin but your people will be my people in other words i am dying off i am dying completely from the moabite your god will be my god your people in other words i'm changing citizenship i am dying to moab i am being born now into israel you cannot move on that road if you don't finish it at the present altar hallelujah he said that's all if you don't do it if you don't feel like you can do it don't try it won't work deeply sincerely but lay yourself upon god bless an author of god's judgment and become just as what to the world as who you don't come here chewing gums you don't sit in the church playing games cannot touch the horn yes sir raise your hand okay most gracious and holy god the almighty el shaddai that appeared to abraham in the name of the almighty the breasted god the strength giver the nourisher of the weak come to us tonight father we realize our weaknesses and our mistake we confess our sin before thee and lay them on their water of water and ask that the blood of jesus christ take them away in the sacrifice that we when you come to the altar don't play a game don't play game if you're not serious don't come but when you come make sure this is the first and the last time because i'm gonna be dead and when i'm rising out from there i'm a new person that don't have horns you have four horns deliverance number of the earth horn what is going on in exodus chapter 21 the bible says he dismitted a man so he died shall surely put to death in other words you kill somebody they have to kill you anybody okay and if a man lie not in weight but god deliver him into his hand then i will appointed a place whether he shall flee you know the city of refuge so if you didn't intentionally purpose to kill somebody and maybe you were working on your field and the instrument just run from your hand and hit somebody and they die you didn't do it purposely god said because of that i put the city of refuge you can leave just go straight enter there and then they'll explain you and you stay there until the death of your high priest you remember that so refuge was only on the cities of refuge let's look it up but if a man come presumptuously upon his neighbor premeditated to slay him with god that shall take him from minor water i thought if somebody died because you kill him without purpose the place you run is the city of refuge there were six of them but now moses opened up something he said if somebody kills somebody purposely with premeditation if he kills somebody go to that person at the altar and kill him so if you kill somebody what are you doing in the altar why you didn't go to the city of refuge because refuge was in the cities of refuge but now we are looking at somebody who killed someone run to the altar what is going on in the altar hallelujah the bible says in first king chapter five well verse one that adonaija the son of hugging the son of david exalted himself saying i will be king david is not dead his son rose up i will be king and he prepare him share your 10 horses and 50 men to run before him you can read this at home then bathsheba comes and talked to david he said david i don't know is already ruling you told me that solomon will be the king david say yes come the general call everybody they call everybody they came he said go make solomon king of israel take my uh my limousine take my mule put him on my limousine let everybody know that i david appointed solomon they went and they appointed solomon king when they begin to try some they're trumping solomon is king solomon everything and the whole israel begin to gather together around salomon adonaija found out that he's in trouble that now they can kill him because the nation went to solomon he need to flee is he going to flee to the city of refuge where is he fleeing verse 50 and i do not just feel because of who and arose and went and did what the water everybody okay so how do i run he look at the city of refuge it's gonna take me two hours to get there the second one five hours this the other one is in ohio no i can't make it i need a flight he looked left and right and he remember something he remember that in the temple there is an altar and that doctor have phone am i reading a different bible and he to the altar to the temple and went there and took a hold of the horn what is the mystery of this altar that if somebody is in trouble he can take hold of the horn and stay ready while the cities of refuge are there at the opening of the seventh year this bible become a new hallelujah and he once told solomon saying behold adonai your brother feared the king solomon king solomon for lo he has caught hold of the horns of the altar saying what let king solomon swear unto me today that he will not slay his servant with water in the city of refuge when you enter there you don't go out you go out they kill you but this horn when you enter there adonai doesn't want to leave their own he's saying tell solomon to swear first before i take hand off the horn if he swear to me that he's not gonna kill me then i will remove but until then what is in this horn hallelujah saying let king solomon swear unto me today that he will not slay his servant with the sword and solomon say if he will show himself a worthy man then shall not ahead of him fall to the earth but if wickedness shall be found in him he shall die i give him a condition if you continue good no problem if you go there and you go shoot somebody again then i'll handle it so king solomon sent and they brought him down from the water and he came and did what to the king to the king they forgave him they forgive him what he did and the king himself have to free you he sent somebody take him off the altar ever here and when you come you bow into the king solomon and salomon say go down what now you can go home free by just holding to the horn what is wrong with those horns brother stephen second king chapter two then determine comes to job job was affiliated with adonaija the first one already hold of the altar they gave him mercy he went home thank you jesus thank you jesus you can go home the second one in trouble what solomon is the king oh my god what am i gonna do the city of refuge there's no flight for chicago there's no flight to go here there's no flight okay what's going on job fled unto the water why are they fleeing to the tabernacle the mystery of the president and cut hold of the water same thing so it looks like when somebody is in trouble and they can't get access to the city of refuge they can run to another secret place called the brazen altar and they were horn in that altar that when you catch that outdoors horn nobody touches you jesus hallelujah and he was told king solomon that job was fled unto the tabernacle of the lord and behold he is by the altar then solomon sent banaya the son of jehoiada saying go and do what go kill him i thought when you were in the horn they don't kill you watch verse 30. and benaya came to the tabernacle of the lord watch clearly and say unto him that says the king do what did solomon tell him that solomon say when you go you will see him at the altar kill him right there but when binaya got there he saw job holding the horn he understood that if somebody hold the horn you don't kill him so he was telling him come forth so when you take your hand from those horns then i slay you everybody okay hallelujah and say unto him that said the king come forth and he said what i'm not gonna remove my hand from here i know why you want me to remove my hand if i remove my hand that is the end of me he said i'm not gonna remove it but i would die here and banaia brought the king word in other words somebody's understanding the law he's a king you're telling me to slay him but he hit his hand he doesn't want to let it go i told him like let it go so when he moved a little bit to the left i can jump on him but he looks like he doesn't move what should i do king about here and bernard brought the king word again saying that said joab and does he answer me and the king said unto him do as he said and fall upon him and bury him that that may just take away the water which who from me and from the house of my job killed somebody innocently not innocently purposely in revenge if you go read the book and according to exodus if you kill somebody intentionally even if you hold to the horn they have a right to take you off but the first one at donaja didn't kill anybody but when he hold on he got refuge what is going on with the horn brother branham said horns means a kingdom brother branham said horns means power and brother branham said lones means the lamb protection so the breast and altar have a power from the kingdom of god to bring protection he was a hidden city of refuge everybody here and david said that in samuel the bible said the god is moroccan in him will i trust he is my shield protection and the horn of my water my high water my water my water that saves me from water all of that in the crust hallelujah blessed be the lord god of israel for he has visited and redeemed his people and has raised a water that was jesus christ in the book of luke a horn of salvation for us in the house of his servant who let the unsaved lord see the place that they are living today flee to the cross for water because the cross was the true altar not only does he purge your sin not only does he clean you up but it's a place of refuge when you hit the cross there's no enemy that can touch you the mystery of the brazen altar ever here the lord god has said unto abraham get the out of your country from your kindred from your father's house unto the land which i will showed you abraham have to separate whatever roof did roof hold onto something and pause second chapter of roof bars answer unto her saying he has fully been showed me all that that has done unto the mother-in-law since the death of whoa boaz already knew he was sure that the first husband was dead and how that has left water and the water like abraham and the water and now come onto a water which the water was abraham knowing where he was going was roof gun knowing where we what he was going the lord recompensed that work and a full water be given thee of the lord god of israel unto whose that have come to she got into the refuge because she crossed by the president everybody let me stop here in the other coat and that's it in the other coat you have two furniture one is water the present altar and the second one is water and if you remember the present altar was square and deliver those two furniture representatives [Music] isaiah said it is he just sitting upon the circle of the water isaiah 11 gather together the displays of judah from the four corners of water everybody here revelation are so foreign standing on the far water so both of them are right and they are putting together in the pyramid the square of the earth and the rand of the earth those two furniture were exposed to the sky this message this message is the only message that can open the bible hallelujah hallelujah let me skip this and let me lay down here can you give me time can you give me five minutes don't go there and start texting me and that shall offer every day a bullet for sin offering for atonement that shall cleanse the altar that which when god has made an atonement for it and that shall anoint it and sanctify it seven days shall they make an atonement for the altar and sanctify it the president and it shall be an alter most holy whatsoever touches that altar should be water and this is what which that which that shall offer upon the water how many lamps two lamps of the first years where when one lamb should you offer in the water and the other lamb in water so at the brazen altar they have to offer two lambs one at the moment when the sun rises and the second lamb when the sun is going down [Music] oh my god oh my god depression speak of divine judgment and the brazen altar where the beast body were burned after the blood was taken every nine o'clock twelve o'clock the clock three o'clock in the afternoon gallon of blood were thrown on this altar over the bodies of the dead beast black smoke was up every water in palestine fell to the water and his hand toward water and the smoke ascended up in water so when they were burning the sacrifice at the brazen altar the prayer the people were raising the hand to bring their prayer up that's why when the publican and the pharisee went to the temple when they were praying in the other coat because there was fire coming up from the altar so they gotta blend their prayer with the sacrifice that's why you are praying at the end you say in jesus name you have to blend the sacrifice hallelujah let me drop this down it was a place where the blood was offered and without the shedding of blood there is no remission of sin no promise of prayer being water outside of water but the children of israel come to there a place that was designated by god for all believers to gather together in one water only place of chosen they were all together every tribe the pharisee he was in the temple they said you said there are yetis and the who remember the public and was in the temple all together gathered in one place of water how beautiful because they why were they gathering there the lamb was what the blood was put upon the water and the body was and the smoke went up and under that smoke which was the sweet smelling silver into the nostril of god as he left the place and all under the blood had the right you would do what it was the utter that bring your sacrifice and you have a right to worship god ever here take first king and let's finish it my god let's go quick to first king chapter 18 and i'm done verse 29. you there nobody should be at home complaining because you're sitting in a couch yeah some are like i can't eat i can't eat no you're sitting in the car 29 you there and you come to pres to pass when midday was passed that they prophesied until the time of the offering of the water the morning sacrifice and the evening sacrifice both of them were under the altar of the brass and elijah was waiting for them and they kept prophesying prophesying prophesying but elijah the prophet could not move until the evening time at the time of the evening sacrifice not the morning sacrifice but the evening sacrifice amen that there was need a voice no any answer not any recorded and elijah said to all the people come water it is the evening time elijah remember that now over there they are burning something in the brazen altar this is the time now everybody is there come here it is time to bring the people back to god it is time to return the people back to god at the time of the evening sacrifice not the morning sacrifice the morning sacrifice happened at the east when the sun was rising but now it's the evening sacrifice [Music] come near me and all the people came near him you must come near to this message and he did water repair water he was repairing the altar in reference to another altar there was another elijah was looking at and elijah began to repair the altar looking at the original order he was rebuilding the faith that was once established over them they found a manta foundation of faith he have to rebuild the faith first restore the altar as he was in the tabernacle this message this message hallelujah he repaired the broken the oath of the lord that was broken down and elijah took how many twelve how many stone worship according to the tribe to the number of the tribe of the son of jacob to whom the word of the lord came and come say israel the name of redemption shall be your name ever here and with the stone he built the altar in the name of the lord which is jesus and he made a water about the altar as great as would contain two measures of water elijah not only rebuilt the altar you ready by robert but around that altar he dig a trench what is going on in the trench anybody okay anybody okay where am i at jesus 33. and he put the wood in order you understand and cut the bullock that was killed over there in the temple cut it in pieces and laid it on the wood and say fill water of water and poured it on the bird sacrifice and on the water the first time and then he said do it the water four plus four is eight and they did it the second time and he said do it there four plus three is 12. everybody here and they did it the third time and the water did water ran around about about the altar and filled the water so the trenches to be filled took through a measure three times the barrel they put one two when he was three the water filled the trench everybody okay and he came to pass at the time of the offering of the water why was elijah waiting for that time that evening sacrifice was upon the present altar so he waded and he matched the temple in the temple there is a sacrifice over there but that is already old now there is a fresh sacrifice that is put there let me continue that elijah the prophet came near and said lord god of who his prayer was at the evening time at the time of the evening sacrifice let me get this jesus christ jesus christ we are here elijah rebuilt the altar put the sacrifice and around it he put the what the trench david says this let's go here he said and he came to pass at the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice that elijah the prophet came near and said lord god of abraham isaac and israel not jacob let it be known this day that you are god of israel and that i am your servant and that you have done all this at your word hear me the sacrifice is burning remember when the sacrifice is burning everybody who prays their prayer is going up elijah is working together in unison with the temple everybody okay and hear me oh lord that the people may know that you are the lord god and that you have done what the water turn water the hot water elijah shall come and turn the water of the children back to the water everybody okay but if you notice if you go in the tabernacle the president doesn't have water did you get it the bras are not ahead the temple doesn't have water you have first depression altar then you got the level but elijah put the president and he put the present there are level together and he put the square the circle and the square and he mixed them back together [Music] this message this message did you see he took the lever and mix both of them together because it's justification he have to turn the heart of the children back again to the time of the apostle then the fire of god comes down and consumed the sacrifice and when he consumed the sacrifice then the heart of israel [Music] hallelujah hallelujah then the heart of all israel was returned back to god not at the morning sacrifice but at the evening sacrifice because at the evening time there will be a light there will be another number that's the seventh hill will open up and bringing another number a reveal lamb a bleeding word that's gonna turn the people back again to the faith of the apostle let's stand [Music] hallelujah hallelujah david say let my prayer be set forth before diaz water thing up of my hand as the water elijah not with the morning the morning sacrifice was for john the baptist to introduce the lamb that was the morning lamb but in the evening time there is another number he have to be introduced by the spirit of elijah as john the baptist that's why brother branham keeps saying as john the baptist he never say as a russia as john the baptist introduced the first or the morning sacrifice the morning lamb so my message will introduce the evening lamb there is two lamps the mystery of the brazen altar the mystery of the brazen altar the mystery of the brazen altar brother branham said before we're really ready for communing with god we must first be washed by the water of the world separation the world is of separation that separate us from our sin the first you cannot talk to god and you cannot commune with god you have to repent for what you have done because you cannot believe right until you are repenting lord forgive my unbelief forgive my unbelief you have to repent first and when you repent your back sin are forgiven then you are a candidate for the baptism and then he promised the holy ghost after the you see the order now you understand the labor you understand the brazen altar a roof have to get here when you get here it is a place of death it is not a place of joke it is a place you have to understand what you're doing when you come to the altar you have to realize that you are bad you have to realize that there is nothing in you that is good you have to realize that there is nothing in you don't give you a right to get to heaven you have to understand that you are completely doomed you have sinned and you have been cut short from the glory of god you have to understand that there is nothing in you normally you should go straight to hell and then you now have to understand that but i have a representation i have somebody who took my plan my place i have somebody who paid the price i have somebody who took the divine judgment somebody who was wounded for my transgression from my sin he was bruised somebody who took my place and you have to put yourself in that place and see the suffering of christ and how jesus was crying at the cross with the spirit all over his face when you see that picture the chewing gum will come enough the joking will stop because it's calling for a death a death which is speaking about a separation i skip a quote but brother branham said that that altar brings separation roof have to be separated from his from her people that's why she have to reach that road that daughter to be completely separated from the mobile once she did it then she can move on to the next stage she get into the holy of holies now ruth can begin to serve let's pray heavenly father lord we are approaching you again father humbly lord thanking you for everything father we did the best that we can and the people gave us some grace to reach where we were going lord many times we seen people coming to the altar over and over but after the altar their lives are not changing we seen teenagers coming to the altar father this is not to condemn them because they didn't know any better they were just going by what they knew by the tradition that was that were in the lands that everybody goes to the altar and just kneel down and pray but they didn't even understand the meaning of that altar father this is examining time as we see things happening into the world as we can even see the movement of the king of the north father we know that the time is very very near we saw what you did here lord with the purple curtain and now you are moving the iron curtain and the bamboo curtain also is lord father joining in we can see those curtains beginning to move again and father we know that it's the time father that the bride should be ready father to meet you into the air lord we cannot go five years without receiving the holy spirit we cannot go 20 years without receiving the holy spirit we cannot continue moving like that and be pleased with a religion because gifts have blended us the gift that you gave the people without repentance have blunded them they thought because they can play because they can sing because they can preach because they can see a dream because they can do this and that therefore you are with them but when they look at their lives father they found out that they're still struggling father may everybody go back like that soldier when lord the father they came to him and they asked him they say you need to think quick why did you left him father he was able to go all the way to the cradle and say this is where i left you father may everybody examine their beginning may they examine if they truly came further unto this altar because this altar is very important like brother branham saying that he's going to wipe all the sin that we did previously father we need that we cannot continue with guiltiness we cannot continue with condemnation we want to go home like the publican that was justified in himself and going home happy knowing lord father that he has confessed his prayer under the burning lamb that was burning upon the brazen altar that lamb was screaming that lamb was crying that lamb was bleeding and the publican could not even look to heaven he put his heads
