[52:54] automatically the first is having one
[52:57] route amen so praise be to the name of
[53:00] the Lord so let's go straight to our
[53:02] scripture this morning very familiar
[53:05] scripture but like I told you on
[53:06] Wednesday scripture have layers
[53:09] amen you can look at one verse the first
[53:13] time you see something the second time
[53:15] you see something and it's amazing the
[53:17] way the scripture are written amen I can
[53:20] take one verse and preach the serpent
[53:22] seed out of it
[53:25] and when you look at that you don't see
[53:27] the serpent seed with your eyes
[53:28] you just take the Holy Spirit to unfold
[53:31] it amen and once the holy spirit
[53:33] unfolded that same holy spirit will come
[53:36] back up again and show you maybe one
[53:38] word and that word when you open you see
[53:41] five sermon laying under
[53:44] amen that's how the word of God is glory
[53:48] to God let's go to Genesis chapter 2.
[53:53] verse 7. amen
[53:57] looks like everything working fine glory
[53:59] to God
[54:01] Hallelujah
[54:03] Genesis chapter 2 verse 7.
[54:06] you might say we read this a lot of time
[54:08] brother Stephen he's a whole lot in this
[54:11] world
[54:12] amen we can preach Genesis for three
[54:15] four years
[54:17] amen and the Lord God formed man
[54:23] Out of the Dust of the ground
[54:25] and breathe into his nostril
[54:28] the breath of life and Man became a
[54:32] living Soul you might be seated we know
[54:36] that we got two men
[54:40] we got the man in the spirit
[54:43] amen which is Genesis 1
[54:47] 26-28 and we got man in the body
[54:51] which is Genesis 2 7. amen
[54:57] glory to God
[55:00] drop to verse 18.
[55:02] the Bible says and the Lord God said
[55:06] it is not good
[55:08] that the man
[55:10] should be alone is my volume okay
[55:13] amen I will make him a help
[55:17] meet for him
[55:19] so remember in the spirit man was double
[55:25] everybody okay
[55:27] man was male
[55:29] and female
[55:33] amen you got the microphone but killed
[55:35] yes sir okay praise God Amen and out of
[55:38] the ground the Lord God verse 19 form
[55:42] every beast of the field
[55:44] and every fowl of the air and brought
[55:48] them to Adam to do what
[55:50] to see
[55:52] what we call them God wanted to test war
[55:56] was in Adam
[55:59] amen God created Adam
[56:02] and he knew the software he put in Adam
[56:06] amen so he created all the beasts the
[56:10] cattle and everything and brought them
[56:13] to Adam
[56:14] so that he can test the software he put
[56:18] in Adam
[56:19] I'm saying that way so you can really
[56:21] catch what I'm trying to say to test
[56:24] when I say software I'm talking about
[56:27] the mind
[56:29] so God had the mind that he put in Adam
[56:34] everybody okay and when he put we on the
[56:37] computer last time
[56:39] so when I talk that language you can get
[56:41] it quickly okay I'm not calling the mind
[56:44] of God the software I'm just making a
[56:47] point like when we say the black dog the
[56:50] white dog we don't mean the holy spirit
[56:52] is a dog it is a type
[56:55] okay
[56:57] amen so when God had the mind that he
[57:02] put into Adam so God wanted to see
[57:06] to test the mind that he put an Adam how
[57:11] is the mind of Adam
[57:13] amen
[57:14] in
[57:16] continuity with his own mind
[57:20] everybody okay
[57:22] because Man was created in the image and
[57:27] in the likeness of water God so man was
[57:29] a replica of God
[57:32] so God want to see if his mind is in
[57:35] Adam
[57:36] so the only way to test his mind is
[57:39] bring an animal before Adam so that Adam
[57:43] will Express the son of man
[57:46] foreign
[57:48] have to come up with the name of the
[57:52] Beast and that name must be exactly the
[57:56] name that God already have in his mind
[58:00] everybody okay
[58:01] everybody okay so nobody can give Adam
[58:04] the name
[58:06] Adam must be able to look at you and say
[58:09] you are uh
[58:13] everybody okay you gotta clear everybody
[58:16] okay Adam must look up and they say you
[58:19] know what you are cephas
[58:22] you got that one you guys see first oh
[58:27] who is there oh oh this is Nathaniel
[58:30] this is an Israelite where there is no
[58:34] God
[58:35] and Natalia say wait a minute who told
[58:37] you about me
[58:39] I don't need anybody to tell me I have
[58:42] the mind of God
[58:46] everybody okay
[58:48] you see how the son of man is hidden
[58:50] here
[58:51] and you can read it over and over and
[58:53] you don't see the son of man that's why
[58:56] God wanted to see
[58:57] he wants to test what he put in Adam let
[59:01] me see how we work is he working
[59:03] correctly Adam said this one is an
[59:06] elephant god say check next next next
[59:09] that's why Adam could call either woo
[59:12] man
[59:15] in other words the revelation of Adam
[59:17] was nothing but God
[59:22] everybody okay verse 19 and he brought
[59:25] them to Adam to see what he would call
[59:28] them
[59:29] and whatsoever
[59:32] Adam did what in other words everything
[59:35] that came from the mouth of God Adam
[59:37] nothing
[59:40] failed
[59:43] everybody okay in other words Adam had
[59:47] the ministry of infallibility
[59:53] everybody okay
[59:54] he was not deceived you remember on
[59:57] Wednesday he did it purposely with his
[59:59] eyes open in other words every time
[1:00:02] you're gonna bring a an animal on the
[1:00:06] platform
[1:00:07] yeah
[1:00:09] do you really get me every time you're
[1:00:12] gonna bring an elephant on his platform
[1:00:15] whoever passes there none of them will
[1:00:18] fail
[1:00:19] every time you're gonna bring your
[1:00:22] patient on the pulpit
[1:00:24] every time somebody's coming on a prayer
[1:00:27] line
[1:00:28] his discernment will never fail
[1:00:33] seven come around the world
[1:00:38] never fail

[1:00:43] [Applause]
[1:00:48] glory to God
[1:00:51] everybody okay my God whatsoever Adam
[1:00:55] called every creature that was the name
[1:00:59] thereof no contradiction between him and
[1:01:02] God everybody okay
[1:01:04] verse 20 and Adam gave name to all
[1:01:08] cattle and to the file of the air and to
[1:01:11] every beast of the field but for Adam
[1:01:15] they was not found a help from a help
[1:01:19] meet for him
[1:01:20] everybody okay
[1:01:23] glory to God
[1:01:25] who first say that it is not good for
[1:01:28] Adam to be alone God so who start the
[1:01:31] problem about Adam being alone God did
[1:01:34] Adam complain no
[1:01:38] so the very origin of a wife
[1:01:45] that's why the Bible say whoever found

[1:10:29] Adam it means that
[1:10:32] where God was working in his manufacture
[1:10:37] amen Adam was not dead
[1:10:40] [Applause]
[1:10:41] what I'm trying to say is this there was
[1:10:45] a distance
[1:10:46] between where Adam sleep
[1:10:49] and where God was working
[1:10:52] So Adam was away
[1:10:56] everybody followed me when God is
[1:10:59] working on the bread Adam must be away
[1:11:04] everybody okay so when God finished he
[1:11:08] looked at the woman brother Branham said
[1:11:10] it was a perfect type of a woman
[1:11:13] Eve was created by God
[1:11:17] and designed by God
[1:11:19] [Applause]
[1:11:22] not what you had before like Satan came
[1:11:25] and begin to work on Eve that's a lie
[1:11:28] everybody care everybody care that's not
[1:11:31] what brother Branham saying we already
[1:11:33] explained you that anybody okay God made
[1:11:36] the ease and Adam was a little bit away
[1:11:39] everybody okay so when God finished
[1:11:42] making Eve somehow Adam begin to come
[1:11:45] out from sleep
[1:11:50] everybody okay when Adam woke up there
[1:11:53] was nobody around
[1:11:56] but here he looked God is Not There
[1:12:01] he said maybe I'm gonna see him in the
[1:12:03] evening time this is the time that God
[1:12:06] usually come and talk to me everybody
[1:12:08] okay then God has to pick Eve from that
[1:12:12] distance and take ease and begin to
[1:12:15] bring her closely to Adam
[1:12:19] foreign
[1:12:21] I'm trying to say is not only is there a
[1:12:25] period of time of the making of the
[1:12:28] bread but there is also a distance
[1:12:33] between where Adam is
[1:12:37] amen and where is is
[1:12:41] amen and he will take God himself
[1:12:48] I don't know if you're getting me the
[1:12:51] one who say it is not good for Adam to
[1:12:53] be alone was who God the one who punched
[1:12:56] Adam was who God the one who pulled the
[1:12:59] whip was who God the one who created the
[1:13:02] woman was who so since he started from
[1:13:05] God he is the author
[1:13:08] and the water finisher and the finisher
[1:13:12] of your faith
[1:13:14] once you start something if he is Alpha
[1:13:19] he have to be the Omega if God started
[1:13:23] your marriage your marriage will not
[1:13:26] help
[1:13:27] if your marriage started from God he
[1:13:31] will not care no matter how much
[1:13:34] difficulty you going through your
[1:13:36] marriage if God started it
[1:13:39] God will finish your marriage what God
[1:13:43] has put together like what
[1:13:47] no man put in water asunder
[1:13:52] [Music]
[1:13:54] everybody okay
[1:13:56] everybody okay everybody okay so nobody
[1:14:01] nobody
[1:14:03] can take ease to Adam
[1:14:11] amen nobody
[1:14:15] no preacher
[1:14:17] [Applause]
[1:14:21] everybody okay
[1:14:23] everybody okay
[1:14:24] he have to be God himself
[1:14:30] who started the word to take the bread
[1:14:33] and to marry the brother
[1:14:36] [Applause]
[1:14:37] in other words the marriage of Adam have
[1:14:41] to be done by God himself
[1:14:44] [Applause]
[1:14:49] the marriage of Adam
[1:14:52] have to be done by whom God himself and
[1:14:56] what God has jumped together let water
[1:14:59] no man
[1:15:02] [Music]
[1:15:05] verse 22 you need to be gracious with me
[1:15:08] on time because time is running quickly
[1:15:10] for me let's go to verse 23.
[1:15:13] Genesis 2 23. and Adam say
[1:15:18] this is not water born of my body
[1:15:21] remember he already have the mind of God
[1:15:24] so whatever God was doing there somehow
[1:15:27] Adam didn't have that Revelation was
[1:15:30] tormenting Adam
[1:15:32] but when Adam saw is a revelation open
[1:15:35] up
[1:15:38] Adam say hey I never seen this
[1:15:41] Revelation before
[1:15:43] I have lived in this world
[1:15:46] I grew up with my sister
[1:15:49] I grew up with my mother but I never
[1:15:52] seen a woman like this one
[1:15:56] he's seen a lot of women in high school
[1:15:59] he's seen a lot of women in the on the
[1:16:02] street he have seen a lot of women in
[1:16:04] Walmart but there is something different
[1:16:07] about this woman
[1:16:08] [Applause]
[1:16:09] thank you
[1:16:11] [Applause]
[1:16:14] you talk to married people
[1:16:16] amen you say what did you see said man
[1:16:21] I never seen that she wants that
[1:16:23] beautiful you were with her all the time
[1:16:26] in the church
[1:16:29] where did that beauty come from
[1:16:31] a revelation open up
[1:16:34] your eyes change
[1:16:36] you begin to look at her differently
[1:16:40] yeah
[1:16:42] everybody okay now Adam said this is now
[1:16:46] born of my bone and Flesh of My Flesh
[1:16:50] she shall be called a water a woman who
[1:16:53] gave the name again so what Adam says
[1:16:57] is perfectly in line with What God Says
[1:17:00] everybody okay because she was taken out
[1:17:04] of water man so the revelation of Adam
[1:17:06] is always correct
[1:17:09] when
[1:17:11] God put Adam to sleep did Adam knew what
[1:17:15] was happening
[1:17:17] no amen when God finished the surgery do
[1:17:21] you think he left his car
[1:17:24] everybody okay so when God took Eve away
[1:17:27] was Adam there when God was making him
[1:17:30] how did Adam knew that Eve came out of
[1:17:33] him
[1:17:36] how did Adam knew when Adam just looked
[1:17:40] he said you you came out of me
[1:17:43] how did he know that
[1:17:47] Adam had the mind of God
[1:17:50] everybody okay that's why he knew all
[1:17:52] things
[1:17:55] everybody okay
[1:17:56] glory to God he said therefore verse 24
[1:18:00] shall a man leave his father
[1:18:03] and his mother and shall be cling to his
[1:18:07] water why and there shall be water one
[1:18:10] flesh because they came from the
[1:18:13] to you they look too flesh
[1:18:15] this is my wife's brother Stephen this
[1:18:17] is me
[1:18:18] that's what you think yeah but you're
[1:18:20] not too flesh
[1:18:22] you were too flesh when she was in her
[1:18:24] parents house
[1:18:26] but since you got married
[1:18:28] you got one flesh
[1:18:31] that's why whatever happened between you
[1:18:33] and her
[1:18:34] God doesn't seed
[1:18:40] are you catching me are you catching me
[1:18:42] God is Not There oh it is
[1:18:45] it is one flesh
[1:18:48] what's the problem
[1:18:50] I don't know if you're catching me
[1:18:52] God doesn't see it he doesn't even pay
[1:18:55] attention
[1:19:00] brother said
[1:19:01] put your hand on your wife
[1:19:03] does he bother you
[1:19:06] does he bother you oh that's a man
[1:19:08] touching a woman why he doesn't bother
[1:19:10] you

[1:19:14] put the hand on the young woman before I
[1:19:17] leave this church I will help people
[1:19:19] line up over there why did brother so
[1:19:22] and so did this why is that one not
[1:19:24] bothering you
[1:19:26] why it doesn't bother you have you ever
[1:19:28] thought because the day we marry
[1:19:31] somebody here God goes in every one of
[1:19:34] you and he take away that stuff away
[1:19:39] the same people that were telling you no
[1:19:41] no no no you need to protect yourself
[1:19:43] you're not married yet okay be careful
[1:19:45] the day of marriage when brother Stephen
[1:19:48] say upon the authority that God given me
[1:19:51] I pronounce you husband and wife you the
[1:19:54] same one who was so legalistic you are
[1:19:57] the first one to say brother hold your
[1:19:59] wife hold them like this hold the hair
[1:20:01] like this move her with oh when he's a
[1:20:03] little bit he said don't be too shy but
[1:20:05] you are the one telling her not to hold
[1:20:07] the wife
[1:20:08] [Applause]
[1:20:11] at that point when he does this when
[1:20:14] when we go to a wedding you start
[1:20:16] sitting there what do you want to see
[1:20:18] [Applause]
[1:20:20] what do you want to see I thought that
[1:20:22] was bad
[1:20:26] it was bad before but now that is John
[1:20:29] together he won't bother you anymore
[1:20:35] why because they become one flesh
[1:20:42] God bless you Mama good to see you she
[1:20:44] might need the translation stuff amen
[1:20:47] glory to God Amen let's go now to verse
[1:20:51] uh 25.
[1:20:53] and they were above water make it the
[1:20:56] man and his wife and were not water a
[1:20:59] shame
[1:21:01] why one flesh
[1:21:04] nothing happened
[1:21:06] two flesh that's when you get in trouble
[1:21:09] because you are still in your parents
[1:21:10] house
[1:21:12] everybody okay let's go to Genesis 5.
[1:21:15] glory to God
[1:21:18] if you dare you can say amen amen
[1:21:21] Genesis 5 verse 1 and 2 glory to God
[1:21:27] remember
[1:21:28] there is a period
[1:21:30] from the punching of Adam
[1:21:33] that God have to take a period of time
[1:21:36] to make the bread and when the period of
[1:21:39] time is finished and the bread is
[1:21:42] completed
[1:21:43] God himself nobody else
[1:21:46] have to be responsible to take the blood
[1:21:50] and to bring the bread back to Adam
[1:21:53] to marry Adam
[1:21:55] and bringing back something from each
[1:21:58] original because Eve was here
[1:22:01] everybody here and Eve is now out as a
[1:22:05] rib and she immorphic from a rib into a
[1:22:09] human being when Eve is completed Eve
[1:22:12] doesn't belong to God
[1:22:14] he was in Adam so God must take Eve
[1:22:18] back to Adam
[1:22:20] The Taking of Eve back to Adam is what
[1:22:24] we call marriage
[1:22:28] everybody okay The Taking of Eve back to
[1:22:32] her original position is called marriage
[1:22:36] and because we are taking Eve back to
[1:22:40] her husband it is also Redemption
[1:22:45] [Applause]
[1:22:47] it's a great mystery so marriage is a
[1:22:51] Redemption
[1:22:52] when we are marrying somebody we are
[1:22:55] really telling this woman that you came
[1:22:58] from this man
[1:23:00] and we're telling the brother brother
[1:23:02] you were missing a party now your party
[1:23:05] is back here you take care and you
[1:23:07] continue with it
[1:23:10] and from that time your life

[1:23:48] a report
[1:23:50] where did you stop
[1:23:55] yeah
[1:23:57] everybody okay because she's part of you

[1:24:17] at block right there I can't get to the
[1:24:20] other
[1:24:22] let's go to verse one
[1:24:25] this is the book of the generation of
[1:24:28] Adam in the day that God created man in
[1:24:31] the likeness of who God made he him have
[1:24:36] male and female you see it right here we
[1:24:38] went through this already male and
[1:24:40] female amen created he them amen and
[1:24:46] blessed them in a spirit and call their
[1:24:50] name
[1:24:52] the name of Adam
[1:24:55] is not the name of a male
[1:24:59] amen God called Dead plural he blessed
[1:25:03] them plural So Adam and his wife both of
[1:25:08] them have one name Adam
[1:25:11] so when you call Adam you are calling
[1:25:14] two people
[1:25:17] everybody okay

[1:25:21] Bible

[1:25:25] God called their name water Adam so Eve
[1:25:30] is Adam in a feminine version
[1:25:36] if you want to see Adam how he looked
[1:25:39] like a woman it's easy
[1:25:41] it came after the fall the name of Eve
[1:25:44] was given after the fall you know that
[1:25:47] right
[1:25:48] amen it's in Genesis chapter 3 after he
[1:25:52] fell then Adam gave Eve another name
[1:25:56] because Adam seen the serpency
[1:25:59] everybody okay but the name of Adam
[1:26:03] means is a demand
[1:26:06] you okay
[1:26:07] he called their name Adam in the day
[1:26:10] when they were water let's go to
[1:26:13] Ephesians 5 then we saw

[1:28:30] for the husband you're gonna understand
[1:28:32] the message very clearly and the purpose
[1:28:35] of this message
[1:28:36] I believe the five sermon we went
[1:28:39] through I don't know four or five you
[1:28:40] should see clearly why we have the
[1:28:42] message of the center
[1:28:44] for the husband is the head of the wife
[1:28:47] even as who Christ so Christ is who
[1:28:55] even as Christ is the head of the water
[1:28:59] church the church and he is the savior
[1:29:02] of water the body
[1:29:03] so crushed the head of the church
[1:29:06] and this is his body
[1:29:09] and his body is the bride

[1:29:19] you there
[1:29:21] husband love your wife even as Christ
[1:29:26] also loves the church and gave himself

[1:29:37] love of God

[1:29:42] have God
[1:29:44] that's why brother Branham said before
[1:29:45] you get married you need the Holy Ghost
[1:29:49] so the Holy Ghost when he's in you he
[1:29:52] will bring the love of God in you so
[1:29:54] that you can love your wife with the
[1:29:57] love of God that's how God wants you to
[1:30:00] love your wife

[1:45:06] my subject this morning is the four
[1:45:09] phases of roof
[1:45:11] Redemption and the greater
[1:45:16] Redemption
[1:45:19] bringing back to original position and
[1:45:22] the great mystery which is about Christ
[1:45:24] and his church marriage
[1:45:28] everybody okay
[1:45:30] we are on the threshing floor with roof
[1:45:33] it's part 48.
[1:45:34] well roof now is entering
[1:45:38] at the rest and rest according to the
[1:45:42] Book of Ruth
[1:45:43] as a mean going and just going to sleep
[1:45:47] rest according to the Book of Ruth means
[1:45:50] marriage
[1:45:51] but it was not just easy as far as much
[1:45:55] as roof have to get in got married and I
[1:45:58] will say no the marriage of roof never
[1:46:00] happened like that the marriage of roof
[1:46:02] was a marriage that was coupled with the
[1:46:06] work of redemption before Boaz can marry
[1:46:09] roof borrowers must first of all gave
[1:46:13] her six measure of value
[1:46:18] everybody okay you know what he means
[1:46:19] now okay because Boaz was the seventh
[1:46:22] one it is the seventh that give the
[1:46:25] sixth it is the seventh seal that opened
[1:46:28] the six sided everybody okay in other
[1:46:30] words the seals must be broken that's
[1:46:33] right
[1:46:35] everybody okay and when the seals are
[1:46:37] broken then boys have to go back to
[1:46:40] finish the work of redemption and come
[1:46:43] back and pick up roof
[1:46:45] hey everybody okay so what's the seals
[1:46:48] are broken it tells you where you are in
[1:46:51] Redemption
[1:46:54] and right here so when you hear the
[1:46:56] opening of the seals it tells you that
[1:46:58] the bridegroom has already unfolded
[1:47:01] himself
[1:47:03] amen now he's going back to deal with
[1:47:06] something
[1:47:07] and when he comes back he's coming to
[1:47:10] pick you up
[1:47:11] everybody okay so since the opening of
[1:47:14] the seals the instructions were given to
[1:47:16] roof get the food go home
[1:47:20] get the sixth measure of Valley go home
[1:47:23] this measure of ballet will give you
[1:47:25] food to eat until I come back to get you
[1:47:29] [Applause]
[1:47:32] everybody okay everybody okay so that's
[1:47:35] why the opening of the seals brought the
[1:47:38] full word
[1:47:40] into manifestation while the bridegroom
[1:47:43] is finishing the work of redemption
[1:47:46] [Applause]
[1:47:48] everybody okay have I lost you now
[1:47:52] according to Matthew 25 we found out
[1:47:55] that we got the parable of the uh ten
[1:47:59] virgins
[1:48:00] amen if you recall
[1:48:03] that we have two vessels
[1:48:07] you remember there was one vessel
[1:48:10] that was connected to a lamp
[1:48:15] [Music]
[1:48:16] there was two vessels there was one
[1:48:19] vessel that was connected to a lamp
[1:48:22] and that vessel was burning
[1:48:25] amen and this land were given to the
[1:48:30] bride to be
[1:48:34] because five of them realized they were
[1:48:37] not Brad
[1:48:38] everybody okay only five were born amen
[1:48:41] and there was another vessel anybody
[1:48:45] follow me that was not used
[1:48:47] that vessels was the one that was
[1:48:50] contending the oil of Reserve
[1:48:56] everybody okay and this all was a
[1:48:59] refilling when the first all is
[1:49:03] completely gone and
[1:49:05] everybody okay
[1:49:08] the first oil that was here
[1:49:12] and the second all are the same
[1:49:17] everybody following me this oil and this
[1:49:22] oil came up from one
[1:49:26] everybody okay but these two all are
[1:49:30] separated based on what they're doing
[1:49:34] everybody okay this oil helped the bread
[1:49:38] or the Virgin to move all the time
[1:49:43] amen but whatever they were doing or
[1:49:46] traveling the bread groom was not there
[1:49:51] everybody okay so it's an oil that work
[1:49:55] when the bridegroom is not there
[1:49:59] everybody okay are you following me but
[1:50:02] when the bridegroom came
[1:50:06] everybody okay the oil have to be
[1:50:09] flipped
[1:50:11] amen from a banol of Brad to be
[1:50:16] everybody okay to annoying of the groom
[1:50:21] amen and only those that have the oil of
[1:50:25] Reserve
[1:50:26] where they want that qualify to enter
[1:50:30] into the marriage
[1:50:32] that's why we call this oil the first
[1:50:34] oil and this oil we call it the water
[1:50:38] so the fish oil have to deal with the
[1:50:41] broad bombing in the absence of the
[1:50:45] groom
[1:50:47] everybody okay but the second oil was
[1:50:51] the oil that was burning only when the
[1:50:55] Gloom has come
[1:50:58] everybody okay so the groom is a man
[1:51:06] everybody okay are you following me and
[1:51:10] the Bride is a female
[1:51:13] everybody okay so these two oil are one
[1:51:20] everybody are following me
[1:51:23] yet they have two Ministry one will burn
[1:51:26] for the female but the other one will
[1:51:29] bring only when the male comes
[1:51:33] [Music]
[1:51:34] have I lost anyone
[1:51:36] have I lost anyone Now by looking at the
[1:51:40] oil we got the oil I mean the the vessel
[1:51:44] that is connected to the lamp and
[1:51:46] another vessel that is not connected to
[1:51:49] the lamb but it's only a a used or
[1:51:53] utilized when the groom comes because
[1:51:55] it's the all of the groom it is a male
[1:51:58] oil
[1:52:00] and there is a female oil but both of
[1:52:02] those oil are
[1:52:05] when we go back again and pulling the
[1:52:08] candlestick

[1:52:13] Candlestick had also a ball ready and
[1:52:16] about them right here

[1:52:45] no
[1:52:46] everybody okay he was one ball feeding
[1:52:50] seven laps
[1:52:51] but all this lamp are just one
[1:52:57] and we know according to the Book of
[1:52:59] Revelation there Candlestick represented
[1:53:02] the church
[1:53:04] amen and the church was not only one
[1:53:09] church but it was seven Church
[1:53:11] and all seven churches have only one boy

[1:53:19] seven Church make up what we call the
[1:53:22] Bride of Jesus Christ

[1:53:42] large bowl a reservoir that is essential
[1:53:46] to seven arms that come out of it this
[1:53:49] ball is filled with olive oil which
[1:53:52] flows through the water seven weeks
[1:53:54] which are placed in the
[1:53:57] seven everybody okay it is the same old
[1:53:59] that burns and make a light at the end
[1:54:03] of the seven water pipes so those right
[1:54:06] together are one light you cannot take

[1:54:33] original outpouring of Pentecost which

[1:54:46] showing perfectly showing forth
[1:54:47] perfectly that Jesus Christ is the same
[1:54:51] today to end today and water forever

[2:09:21] that's the oil
[2:09:23] that first self was many vessels into
[2:09:27] one
[2:09:30] I don't know if you follow me there was
[2:09:32] the original oil
[2:09:36] there was the origin of vessel and now
[2:09:40] there are many vessels
[2:09:43] that was brought
[2:09:46] amen
[2:09:48] at the beginning all you see was the
[2:09:51] vessel but you didn't see that in this
[2:09:54] professor there were many vessels
[2:09:59] everybody okay
[2:10:02] Lord help me verse 5 so she went from
[2:10:06] him
[2:10:07] and shut it's Elisha it is a double
[2:10:11] portion of Elijah
[2:10:14] not one portion but Elijah too
[2:10:18] comes to
[2:10:21] Elijah and Elijah Elijah and the second
[2:10:24] Elijah they give you two Elijah but both
[2:10:28] Elijah are just one it is just a double
[2:10:30] portion of the Same Spirit
[2:10:37] amen Amen brother Branham say Elijah was
[2:10:41] Christ
[2:10:42] he said Elisha was the brother so Elisha
[2:10:46] his ministry need many vessels
[2:10:48] [Applause]
[2:10:51] you follow me do you follow me
[2:10:54] when Elijah went and he left his spirit
[2:10:58] how many people received that spirit
[2:11:03] okay but when they come to Elijah Elijah
[2:11:06] cannot work with one
[2:11:07] he need many vessels
[2:11:11] everybody okay
[2:11:13] in a larger one in a larger one in a
[2:11:17] larger many
[2:11:20] the anointing of Elijah and the
[2:11:23] anointing of Elisha is the same
[2:11:26] anointing only one is double
[2:11:31] everybody okay
[2:11:34] job to verse 4. so she went from him and
[2:11:38] shut the door hell upon her son who
[2:11:40] brought the vessels of her and she did
[2:11:43] water and he came to pass when the
[2:11:47] vessels my million vessels where for so
[2:11:53] no vessels was partial
[2:11:55] wherefore that she said to herself bring
[2:11:59] me yet water in other words next one
[2:12:01] next one next one when she reads one
[2:12:04] when the sun with one million the woman
[2:12:07] said bring me the next one they say mama
[2:12:11] there is no more watch what happened
[2:12:14] everybody care when she said bring me
[2:12:18] yet if yourself and he said to her there
[2:12:21] is not a vessels move and he all did
[2:12:25] what stayed
[2:12:29] in other words the original ball was
[2:12:34] still full
[2:12:35] but out of that one bowl came a million
[2:12:39] balls
[2:12:41] everybody okay now when you look you
[2:12:45] have the original bow and a million ball
[2:12:48] all of them have oil
[2:12:50] but those oil are the same
[2:12:54] but at the beginning all the million all
[2:12:57] were inside the road
[2:13:00] everybody are you understanding me so
[2:13:04] that all that is coming out from the pot
[2:13:07] is the portion that will fill the
[2:13:11] specific vessels
[2:13:13] once the last predestinated vessel is
[2:13:17] filled the oil will stop because there
[2:13:21] is no more people that can receive that
[2:13:25] all
[2:13:26] [Music]
[2:13:28] [Applause]
[2:13:29] are you getting what I'm saying in other
[2:13:32] words John said ahead of his fullness we
[2:13:35] are received so everybody who's the
[2:13:38] Bride of Jesus Christ has a portion of
[2:13:42] the holy spirit that God predestinated
[2:13:45] for you
[2:13:46] when the time come God will dispatch
[2:13:49] dispatch despite until the last
[2:13:54] predestinated
[2:13:56] vessel of the Bride is filled then
[2:14:01] inside Jesus Christ there is no more oil
[2:14:05] for the bride
[2:14:06] [Applause]
[2:14:07] I don't know if you get me the Brad oil
[2:14:10] is finished when the last predestinated
[2:14:13] member of the Bride receive his passion
[2:14:17] then everything is finished but the
[2:14:21] original bucket is still full
[2:14:26] everybody okay now according to Elijah's
[2:14:30] story we have one oil
[2:14:34] versus a million oil
[2:14:37] everybody okay everybody okay
[2:14:40] this million all came from here
[2:14:43] everybody okay but now we have the
[2:14:46] original oil and the million or all
[2:14:49] these oil are the same
[2:14:53] what are you trying to say
[2:14:56] inside this bucket
[2:14:59] amen this bucket was he
[2:15:03] and they
[2:15:07] everybody okay
[2:15:09] they were a million he was one but he
[2:15:14] have the ability because John the
[2:15:17] Baptist say I baptize you with water
[2:15:20] water but there is one coming after me
[2:15:23] he will baptize you with water
[2:15:26] [Applause]
[2:15:28] so that bucket has to be poor it can be
[2:15:32] one bucket have to be poor in each age
[2:15:35] he poor he got the children of God poor
[2:15:38] got the children of God poor got the
[2:15:40] children of God poor God the children of
[2:15:43] God who are gathered children of God
[2:15:45] poor God the children and all they were
[2:15:47] all receiving all from Harmony One
[2:15:50] [Music]
[2:15:51] everybody care when all these are filled
[2:15:55] he's still dead
[2:15:57] as the Eternal Pillar of Fire in other
[2:16:00] words when you see the pillar of fire
[2:16:03] here inside brother brought them here
[2:16:06] there was another portion of the pillar
[2:16:08] of fire that don't belong to him
[2:16:12] I'm talking to you so you understand
[2:16:15] the person that was in here in brother
[2:16:18] Branham is a specific portion of the
[2:16:22] pillar of fire unique to brother Branham
[2:16:26] himself
[2:16:29] [Applause]
[2:16:31] everybody okay so that when the big
[2:16:34] magnet is coming up everybody that have
[2:16:38] a magnet everybody that have the Holy
[2:16:41] Ghost will begin to respond quickly when
[2:16:45] the magnet goes to the right you will
[2:16:47] see all of you going to the right well
[2:16:49] the reason why you are behaving that way
[2:16:52] it is no more you it is Trust
[2:16:56] the fifth that I live with now it is the
[2:17:00] faith of the Son of God everybody okay
[2:17:02] clear everybody okay everybody okay so
[2:17:06] in the spirit it's male and female in
[2:17:09] the body also we find out that it's male
[2:17:12] and female
[2:17:14] everybody okay oh God help me brother
[2:17:17] Barnum said this about Jesus Christ he
[2:17:19] said but remember he went there with you
[2:17:22] in him
[2:17:24] see God has never separated the bread
[2:17:27] from the groom yet so when God looked
[2:17:30] down upon the body of who because he saw
[2:17:34] what of melon and water female he was
[2:17:37] all redeeming to water one body so the
[2:17:40] body of Jesus Christ also was double
[2:17:44] everybody okay so what happened to
[2:17:47] Christ
[2:17:48] glory to God brother Branham said I want
[2:17:51] to show you when God gave adam his blood
[2:17:54] from his side he said Jesus Flesh of My
[2:17:59] Flesh and born of my bone is that right
[2:18:02] when God gave Christ his brother
[2:18:05] the spirit gave the flesh the bride he
[2:18:08] did what punch
[2:18:17] and blood and the Spirit come forth that
[2:18:21] become water flesh and water born of his
[2:18:24] bones we are the Flesh and Bones the
[2:18:27] blood will be water the Flesh and the
[2:18:30] bones of who Christ exactly
[2:18:34] everybody okay
[2:18:37] glory to God
[2:18:39] get ready to swallow this now amen
[2:18:43] amen
[2:18:44] Jesus was put to sleep
[2:18:48] everybody okay just like Adam was put to
[2:18:52] sleep
[2:18:53] you're following me when Jesus was put
[2:18:56] to sleep at the cross
[2:18:58] because they sleep is death God peace
[2:19:01] Jesus Christ
[2:19:03] because Isaiah say Jesus was Smitten by
[2:19:06] God you know the scripture it's Isaiah
[2:19:09] 53 he said he was Smitten by God it was
[2:19:12] God that punch him using a Roman spear
[2:19:16] that's why all things happen for a
[2:19:19] reason amen when God pulls Jesus pierced
[2:19:23] Jesus from the side water and blood came
[2:19:26] out everybody but what came out there
[2:19:31] amen Jesus himself did not see it that
[2:19:36] exactly right
[2:19:39] I told you you need to swallow this
[2:19:42] everybody here when the bride was been
[2:19:45] pulled from Adam I am Adam didn't see
[2:19:48] Adam was asleep and if you remember God
[2:19:52] made sure they made sure Jesus was there
[2:19:55] they touch him they say he's already
[2:19:57] dead
[2:19:58] don't touch him anymore and they did
[2:20:00] what then they please him after he was
[2:20:03] completely asleep so whatever was
[2:20:06] happening Jesus was not away
[2:20:11] everybody okay so what came out of there
[2:20:15] Jesus didn't see
[2:20:18] are you following me so God have to take
[2:20:21] the rib
[2:20:23] everybody okay that came out of Jesus
[2:20:26] and just like the first Adam God needed
[2:20:31] a period of time
[2:20:35] everybody okay to manufacture the bread
[2:20:38] God need also a period of time to build
[2:20:43] the bread of Jesus Christ
[2:20:46] unto seven Church ages
[2:20:50] everybody okay so the Bride of power is
[2:20:54] to leader
[2:20:56] that's why Paul said I can only espouse
[2:20:59] you to Jesus Christ amen so the bride
[2:21:03] have to grow up
[2:21:08] everybody okay everybody okay the period
[2:21:11] of time that God took to make the bread
[2:21:15] of Adam is called to ask the seven
[2:21:19] churches
[2:21:21] [Applause]
[2:21:22] [Music]

[2:24:20] the Holy Ghost of Jesus Christ and the
[2:24:23] holy ghost that we have are one Holy
[2:24:26] Ghost
[2:24:27] the first oil and the second Earth are
[2:24:31] one oil
[2:24:32] they're only in one million faces and
[2:24:35] the old on one vessel came up from One
[2:24:38] Source but the old God came to one
[2:24:40] million is a feminine oil I have that
[2:24:45] bridegroom
[2:24:46] [Applause]
[2:24:47] [Music]
[2:24:48] [Applause]
[2:24:51] [Music]
[2:24:55] everybody okay the holy ghost that you
[2:24:58] receive is the female
[2:25:02] the broad portion of the Holy Ghost
[2:25:07] it is not different but it qualifies it
[2:25:12] you as the Bride of Jesus Christ
[2:25:15] everybody okay everybody okay it is the
[2:25:18] portion of the Holy Ghost that God
[2:25:21] reserves for the bread of Jesus Christ
[2:25:24] God split himself
[2:25:27] he took a portion of himself he called
[2:25:31] him
[2:25:34] but the one who work
[2:25:37] and the one who's receiving both of them
[2:25:41] are one
[2:25:47] I don't know if you're kidding me
[2:25:50] Eve and Adam are one
[2:25:53] Eve came out of Adam
[2:25:55] So Adam cannot give God cannot give Eve
[2:26:00] a different spirit
[2:26:02] because she came out from other he need
[2:26:04] to go to Adam and when God goes to Adam
[2:26:08] Adam has he's worth what and what a
[2:26:12] female so he have to take the female
[2:26:14] part
[2:26:15] of Adam which is nothing but the spirit
[2:26:18] of Adam
[2:26:19] and bring that female apart and put it
[2:26:22] in other
[2:26:23] So Adam becomes 50.
[2:26:28] I don't know if you're kidding me and if
[2:26:31] also becomes 50 that's why King has
[2:26:35] service God Esther ask me up to the

[2:28:03] forever
[2:28:05] because he lost it he want to be with

[2:37:26] the female the female part of the Holy
[2:37:29] Ghost which is the part of the bread
[2:37:32] that will be responsible to make the
[2:37:35] blood of Jesus Christ so God is pouring
[2:37:38] the portion of the Bride into the woman
[2:37:42] so now the woman and the bride both of
[2:37:46] them are one
[2:37:49] he gets five sermon to guide you to this
[2:37:52] body
[2:37:53] everybody okay everybody okay let me see
[2:37:56] where I can uh land the world must
[2:37:59] deliver the bread the word bro church
[2:38:02] the church got to be delivered out of
[2:38:04] her they brought for who Christ
[2:38:07] them that fell asleep in all ages will
[2:38:10] make up their prayer that come out on
[2:38:12] out on the word and that and that that
[2:38:15] they come out on like from your feet
[2:38:18] coming to your head because God is
[2:38:21] building it he need a period of time
[2:38:23] gets greater and more you have to have
[2:38:25] and so forth the body grows up so that's
[2:38:29] the body of Christ do what grows up
[2:38:31] because they cannot give Jesus Christ a
[2:38:34] rib they cannot give Adam away God
[2:38:36] needed a period of time to build and
[2:38:39] then finally the water hey we'll do what
[2:38:42] come to it when the bra the bad is
[2:38:45] completed then what comes now the head
[2:38:49] that's why they had this called the
[2:38:52] Capstone
[2:38:53] is coming to cap the building
[2:38:56] [Applause]
[2:38:56] [Music]
[2:38:57] [Applause]
[2:39:08] [Music]
[2:39:17] [Applause]
[2:39:19] hey everybody okay this one is the bread
[2:39:25] but the blood is not a pyramid
[2:39:28] But the Groom is the head
[2:39:32] But the Groom himself is a pyramid he is
[2:39:37] always a pyramid he's always the pillar
[2:39:40] of Fire
[2:39:42] everybody okay so when he comes and
[2:39:47] connects to the bride the bride and the
[2:39:51] groom both of them make a pyramid and
[2:39:55] when they blend together
[2:39:58] this meter here disappeared
[2:40:00] [Applause]
[2:40:08] and this is what Paul said now it's the
[2:40:11] God who is all in all true inner
[2:40:15] everything now there is no more
[2:40:17] difference
[2:40:18] now the pyramid is one
[2:40:23] did I lost you
[2:40:28] mature food body amen and then finally
[2:40:32] the head will do what come to the head
[2:40:35] of its will if you notice because it is
[2:40:38] linked to the head the head that's the
[2:40:40] water turn it and the water pulling the
[2:40:42] big magnet that is
[2:40:45] everybody okay everybody okay let me
[2:40:48] find the landing place
[2:40:52] you want to stop here
[2:40:54] let me push a little then we stop so
[2:40:57] somebody can chew at home now
[2:40:59] amen we found out that this is the head
[2:41:03] and this one is the bride everybody okay
[2:41:07] this is the female part of God
[2:41:11] and this is the male part of God
[2:41:14] amen you cannot have marriage if the
[2:41:18] male doesn't come that's right
[2:41:22] did you get me did you get me you cannot
[2:41:26] have the marriage if the second oil
[2:41:28] doesn't come
[2:41:30] the first all will work you up
[2:41:33] but you will reach a certain point where
[2:41:36] the bridegroom
[2:41:39] then you need to use a second gift
[2:41:42] to pull you there because the ministry
[2:41:44] here must be so close to this exactly
[2:41:48] the same that they can blame and until
[2:41:51] they don't see any scar
[2:41:53] [Music]
[2:41:56] everybody okay maybe I need to stop here
[2:42:01] everybody okay everybody okay
[2:42:04] now when God pulled the bread out of
[2:42:09] Adam he pulled Eve Wednesday we found
[2:42:13] that he made the eve a byproduct
[2:42:17] you remember that and when the bride was
[2:42:21] punched out of Jesus Christ we came out
[2:42:24] from the side we are by product also by
[2:42:28] sex because Jesus came with a sex that's
[2:42:32] right all of us are born with sex Adam
[2:42:35] came originally but Eve came from the
[2:42:39] the flesh that was already worked with
[2:42:42] and then producing so just like there
[2:42:45] was a bright product of the first Adam
[2:42:48] there was also a byproduct of the second
[2:42:52] Adam because both two Brad came from the
[2:42:55] Sun
[2:42:58] are we okay are we okay because of the
[2:43:02] by-product he fell
[2:43:09] amen everybody okay what do you expect
[2:43:12] to come if the bride of Christ is
[2:43:16] brought forth out
[2:43:18] as a byproduct
[2:43:23] you want to go home
[2:43:28] I'm getting to a different material
[2:43:31] let me try to stop somewhere
[2:43:33] the birth of the church was that what
[2:43:35] Pentecost as the first Adam was given a
[2:43:39] bread how fresh from the hand of God and
[2:43:43] was how undefiled for a brief span
[2:43:47] three
[2:43:48] so was who Christ the last Adam giving a
[2:43:52] bride pure and fresh and what Pentacles
[2:43:55] and she remains separate and
[2:43:56] undefaultful sometimes
[2:44:01] everybody okay
[2:44:02] brother Branham say how long did this
[2:44:05] how long this continue we don't know but
[2:44:09] one day even as Eve was tempting and
[2:44:13] seduced by who Satan so the church was
[2:44:17] contaminated but the interest of an
[2:44:19] antichrist What Spirit remember the
[2:44:22] Beast that's why Paul say I see you
[2:44:26] as the serpent began
[2:44:29] you both got up from the side of Christ
[2:44:32] the serpent is coming back again
[2:44:35] everybody okay everybody okay brother
[2:44:38] Branham say and this he quotes the
[2:44:41] scripture is that other Spirit of
[2:44:43] antichrist whereof ye have heard that it
[2:44:45] should come and even now already it is
[2:44:48] in the world this is already the first
[2:44:50] stage the Antichrist
[2:44:52] amen he said and Jesus said concerning
[2:44:55] his bread in that first stage I'm going
[2:44:58] to skip for time the church was in that
[2:45:01] first stage already here Fallen woman I
[2:45:05] said them has gotten to eat before Adam
[2:45:08] even now had Satan seduced the church
[2:45:11] the Bride of who Christ before the
[2:45:14] marriage supper of the Lamb individually
[2:45:17] certain didn't win
[2:45:20] because individually we were baptized
[2:45:23] with the Holy Spirit

[2:46:17] would believe the word of God and live
[2:46:19] or that the word and do what die she
[2:46:21] doubted and she left the word and she
[2:46:23] did what died

[2:47:46] predestinated
[2:47:48] there is the Water mystery he before
[2:47:51] Christ or anything else was ever on
[2:47:55] Earth you see his great mystery that he
[2:47:59] chose the water the bride knowing water
[2:48:01] evil fall from water disbelieving the
[2:48:05] word knowing that she would want for but
[2:48:08] he would choose a right that would work
[2:48:11] now fall
[2:48:16] so the end one is here
[2:48:19] amen
[2:48:23] he went and pick you up
[2:48:25] amen but Jesus Christ also when pilgrims
[2:48:29] enter and the serpent the dragon got
[2:48:32] into it the old serpent God never left
[2:48:34] the bread like that amen God started to
[2:48:38] rebuild through Luther
[2:48:40] justification
[2:48:42] he picked up one sanctification and
[2:48:45] began to worship and the Pentecostal
[2:48:47] that God must present himself abroad to
[2:48:52] prove to Lucifer that I will have a
[2:48:54] brother that you will never catch
[2:48:57] everybody okay everybody okay brother
[2:49:00] Bradham say knowing that he would choose
[2:49:03] a brand that will not fall that would
[2:49:05] hold to the world how regardless of what
[2:49:09] are the water the rest of the world has
[2:49:12] to say what about they will hold to that
[2:49:15] word they are predestinated to do what
[2:49:19] to stand there the adoption of the
[2:49:21] children by who Jesus Christ destinated
[2:49:23] the church to that great glorious what
[2:49:25] stands so somebody will not stare
[2:49:30] itself
[2:49:32] second blood cell so there is one
[2:49:35] because God is perfected in three
[2:49:40] let me see if I can land this trip
[2:49:42] amen
[2:49:44] you say brother Stephen they have the
[2:49:47] Holy Ghost yes but how did they fail
[2:49:52] remember Adam
[2:49:54] was a man he was
[2:49:57] Eve was a female she was
[2:50:01] in if that she missed
[2:50:08] watch this
[2:50:09] brother Branham say each one of those
[2:50:12] ages only taken a what
[2:50:16] whoa watch out
[2:50:18] yeah wow everybody okay they were coming
[2:50:21] from one ball
[2:50:23] are you following me are you following
[2:50:25] me I'm talking about the church
[2:50:27] collectively
[2:50:29] that's why Paul said I preach in
[2:50:34] they were only taking water
[2:50:38] they didn't have the full thing
[2:50:41] everybody okay you want to understand
[2:50:43] your message
[2:50:45] they were only taken water into the
[2:50:48] water
[2:50:49] justification is a work of water my
[2:50:52] brother you there can you give him
[2:50:54] another microphone you dare try it again
[2:50:57] praise God
[2:51:00] man is working
[2:51:02] praise God praise God okay I don't know
[2:51:04] what happened amen he said justification
[2:51:07] is a work of the water Holy Spirit
[2:51:09] sanctification is a work of work the
[2:51:12] Holy Spirit the baptism of the baptism
[2:51:14] means the work of what holy spirit that
[2:51:16] is the reason he took a prophetic
[2:51:19] perfect
[2:51:20] calm down no messenger today because the
[2:51:24] Holy Ghost came wow himself
[2:51:27] fullness baptism
[2:51:31] thank you
[2:51:33] are you following me are you following
[2:51:36] me they kind of stigma the fact remember
[2:51:40] this is just part
[2:51:42] amen there is missing the perfecting
[2:51:45] part
[2:51:45] as long as the perfecting part is not
[2:51:48] come
[2:51:49] this part here is not a pyramid
[2:51:53] it looks almost like a pyramid
[2:51:55] that's why Satan when he knocks this one
[2:51:58] out
[2:51:59] knock him down because the head is
[2:52:02] nothing
[2:52:03] that's why we need the head
[2:52:05] so that when Satan come again when he's
[2:52:09] tested
[2:52:10] he will hear what he heard in the
[2:52:13] wilderness when Jesus came out of the
[2:52:15] wilderness
[2:52:17] because when Jesus came out from the 40
[2:52:20] days of passing Satan came and thought
[2:52:24] he was like Abraham
[2:52:27] because Abraham lied he thought he was
[2:52:30] like Joseph because Joseph lied he
[2:52:33] thought he was like Jacob but Jacob lied
[2:52:36] but he never met that anointing before
[2:52:41] because when that anointing was coming
[2:52:44] out he was a little man that was tired
[2:52:47] like this
[2:52:48] Satan look he said look at him he looked
[2:52:51] like a let me try to get him again
[2:52:54] when he tried him
[2:52:56] there are nothing responded it is
[2:52:58] written it is written it is written
[2:53:01] certain looking good
[2:53:04] he said who is loving that is the son of
[2:53:08] man
[2:53:10] it is the son of man this one is like
[2:53:14] the son of man we don't need like the
[2:53:17] son of man we meet the son of man
[2:53:20] himself
