you all for making the program a wonderful one and we just give glory to the Lord amen just to keep it short that way but I just want to give a testimony um I don't know if you all saw the DJ the one on the sound yesterday um getting to the end of the program or at the end of the program he called both of us my wife and I and he said that when he came for the program he didn't know exactly what it was even though I sent him the songs and all that um but listening to the testimonies know that he realized that the program was for him um so let me give you a little background he's actually one of the pastors of the church that we U rented the the venue so he told me that he's on dialysis and then even that morning he went to do dialysis before coming to the program so um throughout the whole program he was listening and then he was touched that the scripture that our sister had been using is the same scripture he's been using so that had been a confirmation to him so I just want to thank God that we had been praying that this program was going to be a blessing to us leaving one person so we just want to thank the Lord for this I'd like to say something in in a little bit because uh um he's not alone is he I think uh there is not a person here who can't say that we have been influenced and inspired um from what you know portion of the journey we've witnessed and it gives us hope it gives us um Faith um uh right now especially for our sister Kelly and um it's wonderful to sit in a congregation and witness the Miracles of God in our face he's in our face so God bless you all for sh you know for sharing that with us yesterday and for allowing us to be a part of it so I have one of here from Sister Priscilla she said she wants to thank God that her youngest daughter Sarah graduated from high school uh she is off to college in the fall and I pray God to guide her amen so let's remember that um here's a prayer request as well from Sister Priscilla please pray for a two-year-old boy Bruno um Molino um he is in the ICU ah he suffered four heart attacks um pray to God to touch him and heal him amen so I will leave that here here and then we have one other that's also it's also been performed here before amongst our congregation BR brother Daly is missing his wallet and how many times have has God given us back our keys and our wallets and we witnessed a car being returned one time that was stolen at a at a at an old church so it's not impossible amen it's not impossible at all and we'll hold our faith with you on that as well so if we can stand I'm going to ask Brother Sam since he is with us this morning if he wouldn't mind coming up and praying over these uh prayer requests amen and uh we've got some specials this morning amen it's just a real privilege to be with you to be with you yesterday and we just pray God continues to bless the Journey of each Soul presence Lord and father now as we uh just offer from the bottom of of our souls the

Fellowship around the revealed word of the hour amen I believe everyone is up to date with the sermon and we reading our Bible twice a day if you don't do it I call Brother Mickey to deal that with me one chapter in the morning one chapter before you go to bed we're reading our cood church ages 70 weeks C adoption or somebody is listening to the message of the hour amen to the best of my understanding I'm waiting for a confirmation of the date young men in August young Sisters Meeting in August and then question and answer in August the 24th yesterday we have a wonderful time together and it's amazing how God can use one service for somebody who was sitting in the sun Booth to just preach the gospel in and another way just to give somebody a hope so if that man can cling on faith before you know it the same thing thing will happen because he's the same yesterday today and forever amen I thought Brother Sam I say if he would have told me I would be sitting there enjoying the word and him preaching right here so he just slip in and here he is amen always been one of us we communicate back and forth and sometime he send me quote and wonderful things and then good insight about the word of God Amen I believe I covered everything I will try to finish the reading of the scripture I will try by God's grace amen let's go to our scripture glory to God I wanted to move on where I promised to get to finish with David and get into Christ and uh we were reading our Bible before going to bed and my wife happened to read Psalm 105 and as soon as she started reading it the ho the spirit of the Lord came down and it's like somebody opening a new door she doesn't know it till now and I say well it's going to be something like this and uh it was just one minute the way we look at time and the way God work with time is different that's why brother BR I'm say you might dream a long dream but truly you only did it in 3 seconds so your timing is not the timing of Eternity one minute can give me 24 sermon one minute and as the Lord spoke to me it was just one minute less than one minute I saw it then I went and I sat down and the quat begin to come 1 2 3 4 5 six so I have to put everything I was supposed to Preach Today I push it for next week so let me try if I can read the scripture and finish it we okay so let's pray Heavenly Father Lord we are approaching you again humbly this morning Father thanking you for your grace your love your mercy and for the song of Zion and to be able to Fellowship together with such a wonderful people Lord we are unworthy to receive such a great grace when people are longing just for fellowship and we get it Lord father because of the blood of Calvary father thank you we commit this service unto th hand Lord may you move me completely out of the way I'm a human being Lord limited Lord father to many abilities but you are the unlimited one may you come down and speak to your children and bless your children tonight Lord for today here and all over the world Lord father move me completely out the way and seal the devil out of this place in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen let's go let me give you your title so we make sure we clear our life journey through Joseph's five garments part 18 we clear with that let's go to our scripture now Exodus chapter 4 my daughter poke on this yesterday she was like are you preaching on this are you preaching on this because sometime when I'm working she comes and she picks it up she say what is what are we preaching tomorrow and she take note Exodus chapter 4 if you dare you can say amen amen Exodus 4 verse 10 oh Lord help me if you dare you can say Amen amen the Bible says and Moses say to the Lord oh my Lord I am not eloquent don't you think God knew that in other word he's telling God you're making a mistake because here we are at the burning bush God is commissioning Moses he is calling him and say hey you're the man that are qualified for the job and Moses is looking at God he say wait a minute maybe you miss suod something or you missed something when you were looking at your computer did you realize that I'm not eloquent you might be seated God when he calls you amen amen amen when he speak to you amen he knows you better than yourself amen amen amen amen amen amen God doesn't make a mistake when God speak to you through a preacher through his word through a prophet it means that you are already [Applause] qualified so you might as well quit looking at yourself and look at the one who's talking because that man never make a mistake even though you think he's making a mistake God never make a mistake he sees beyond your weaknesses beyond your limitation beyond your impossible what seems impossible amen Baba you can make it possible amen that's the god that we serve his name is Jesus Christ he open ways where there seems to be no ways how can you talk to a man who have a problem in his mouth to be a preacher amen amen amen amen didn't you notice that this boy struggle since he was a young man come on and this is the one you choose that's right of course Moses in the presence of God see why I told you it's hard I don't know if I'm going to finish my scripture verse 10 and Moses said to the Lord oh my Lord I am not eloquent neither he to for in other word neither in the past amen nor since you have spoken to your servant so in the past I was not eloquent when you talking to me right now even after you finish talking to me nothing have changed that not God's problem when he spoke that said it's finished amen amen amen amen stop looking at your weaknesses God knows you amen amen he says before in the past I was not arrogant you just finished talking to me don't you see how I'm stuttering I'm still not able to speak amen glory to God he to for nor since you have spoken to your servant but I am slow of speech and of a what slow Tong and the Lord said to him who has made men's mouth is that way who you talking to who created you who created your mouth the part of the body that have a problem who created it when you were born you think I didn't see what the devil was doing that defect that you use as an excuse before serving the lord don't you think I already seen that who make human being who fabricate who manufacture human being I hope you're catching something the Lord say who has made his mouth men's mouth I'm sorry or who makes the dumb or death or the sin or the blind have not I the Lord God right here is telling Moses something you can read this and continue and you will miss something let's read it again verse 11 and the Lord said to him who has made man's mouth God is revealing to Moses as a Creator amen that's it that's it the one who can make a MTH is not a manufacturer only God can make somebody's mouth in other word Moses I am a God that creates Moses I am a god of creation amen I create things amen number two he says who makes the dam or death or or the scene or the Bland in other word I am not only a god of creation but I am also a god of Miracle amen if you need me to create something I can do it amen if you need a miracle I can do it so God in the ministry of Moses is a God that can create and a God that can do Miracle he's telling Moses in your ministry you will have a portion of me creating things and a portion of me fulfilling wonders all miracles are we together are we together have not di the Lord verse 12 now therefore go did you fix my mouth no no the way your mouth look go just that way no I thought you need to fix my speeches just go with that weakness because that weakness is what I trap the devil with when the devil sees your weaknesses he will underestimate you and through the weakness is the very spot I'm going to whoop the [Applause] devil that's why Paul say when I am weak that's when I am strong when Jesus is hungry after fasting and he's may be walking a little bit like this the devil thought I can whoop Jesus Christ he made the greatest mistake that he ever made because when he approached Jesus Christ in his weakness that when Christ was even stronger and he went back again and he said it is written when the devil touch he say I never felt such electricity this one is not Moses this is not Elijah who is this man he say Satan you shall not tempt the Lord your God in other word I am God you don't tempt me even if I am weak I am still God in human flesh and you are God [Applause] you are a god even when you weak great is in that is in you than he that is in the [Applause] world are we together are we together don't never underestimate yourself look at the man on the inside he's bigger he created everything he is God he's called The Holy ghost it is Christ in you the hope of glory are we together are we together Hallelujah where are we at verse 12 verse 12 now therefore go and I will be with your mouth your weakness there in other word I'm going to ride on that weakness you say your problem is the MTH God didn't say I will be with your hand okay I'm going to use you I will be where the problem is so I can grab the devil very [Applause] well amen amen am Moses was so dangerous to the devil until when he died and his body was left without any life the devil seek for the body he say no no no this one even when he's dead he's more dangerous let me where is his body yet because the same thing happened with Jesus Christ as he dies and they put him on the cross that is when he goes on the head quarter of hell and destroy everything so the deeper the devil is taking you the more powerful you going to destroy him are we together are we together where are we at my friend verse 13 now therefore he says no verse 12 now therefore I will be with your mouth and do what and teach thee what Thou shalt say I'm going to teach you somebody's receiving an answer right here for a question and answer I have not touch it yet amen I will teach you what you shall do what say so when Moses is say who's saying God so keep looking at Moses and you will realize who's talking through Moses because the mouth of Moses have become the mouth of God and the word of Moses become the word of God are we together are we together verse 13 and he said oh oh my Lord this is us here send I pray you by the hand of him whom you will what do you know what that means in another words send somebody else despite everything that you're saying I mean no no no no I don't qualify good luck amen when God chose you you don't have a choice you don't even have an option when God already said it's you there is no other option you better Just Surrender because God when he made his decision he cannot change that decision if he changes the decision he's no longer God so your excuse is you trying to make him not a god when he's a God so you better just surrender to him because he's not going to back up are we together are we together 14 and the anger of the Lord was kindled against Moses and he said is not Aaron delivered your brother I know that he can speak well in other word I know and also behold he comes forth to meet you it's a prophetic now and when he sees you he will be glad in his heart and you shall speak to him amen and put word in his mouth I hope I'm going to even be able to touch this amen and put word in his mouth and I will be with your mouth and with his mouth and will teach you what you shall do we found subject we have five garments follow me carefully now the first one is a coat of many color amen Oh Oh Glory to God the second one is a servant or a slave the third one is Joseph as a prisoner the fourth one is Joseph changing garment to appear here before Pharaoh amen and the last one is Joseph wearing fine lining from Pharaoh Joseph adopted in his position we took this garment through Joseph through Jesus Christ through Elisha through Paul through David through Israel through Joshua through Rebeca through Rachel through Zora and the woman in Chicago even unto roof here we dealing with a Man Called Moses when we look at the beginning of Moses as we looking at the screen before we get to where God is empowering him amen his birth is very peculiar the the Bible says in the book of Exodus chapter 2 verse1 and there went a man of the house of Levi and took two wife a daughter of Levi so Moses came from the tribe of Levi and the woman conceived and be a son and when she saw him that he was a goodly child she hid him three mon so the reason why they hid Moses is because he was goodly what does goodly mean Act 7 verse 20 the Bible say in which time Moses was born and was exceeding fair in other words Moses was a handsome boy a beautiful baby just like David sir just like Joseph are we together EX inly Fair he was very beautiful and nished up into his father house how many month three months do you had a child just because he's beautiful what does he really mean in the book of Hebrew chapter 11 verse 23 the Bible say by faith Moses when he was born was he three month of his parent so this hiding was coule with Revelation that's right because it happened by faith amen it was not just because the child looks beautiful there was a revelation that goes with it amen the Bible say when he was born he was hid three month of his parent because they saw he was a proper child so Moses was not just beautiful but he was a proper child the word proper means unusual peculiar strange in other word when you look at Moses he's so beautiful and there is something strange about Moses brother Bram says in the message proving his word in 1964 he say but one day the predestinated seed was born a child that was a proper child there was something about him that seems how strange so God in your making in your Fabrication in your creation put something strange about you that even you yourself don't understand Amen brother Bram says this in the message the authority of the word he said Moses when he was born he was born a proper child God had him brought here Moses had nothing to do with it is that right John the Baptist how many years my friend 712 years before he was born he was the voice of one crying in the wilderness Jeremiah 1:4 say God told Jeremiah before you were even formed in your mother's womb I did what I knew you and I did what Sanctified you and ordained you to be what a prophet over the nation how could he help it gift and calling are how without repentance you are that way because God made you that way the way that you look strange am strange to your neighbor strange to your friend strange to your boss strange to people around you it is for a reason keep that hardness on you because that oldness hold a [Applause] mystery brother Bram say who taking thought can add one kid to his statue Why Try to impersonate anything when you are just making well you are just doing something that is not what right in other word don't try to copy somebody because the way you are peculiar amen there is a purpose because of the way you are when you are trying to copy something you are actually losing God's original identity it's something that God put in you and God will use that thing so Remain the way God created you remove what is seen from your life but keep your originality because God created you T for a purpose short for a purpose thin for a purpose what we call fat for a purpose stay the way God created you don't try to get somebody else [Applause] identity are we together are we together oh glory to God if you had how many if you had what brown eyes you never get what blue they are what're Brown even if you put a chemical in the morning tomorrow your eyes will come back to normal yes are we together so they are blue you can't make your statue one in larger or what or smaller stay where you are because God in your making made you a certain way for a purpose do you follow me do you follow me do you follow me if there is a door that is this high if you talk how are you going to get there amen God knew I'm going to keep you this short so you can pass on without any problem if you say God make me tall no no no no no no no your path is a path of zakus Amen so man zakus God knows you're going to clim on a tree and when he's passing by he will stop under the tree and he will look it up to you if you don't climb under the tree you not zakus so we made zakus and God will lead you to a tree where he's going to pass by are we together everything is working together for what good are we together now as we continue to look at Moses the Bible says here in act chapter 27 that he was exceeding Fair now we understand that he's peculiar and he was Nish up in his father house three month and when he was cast out because they can't keep him Trouble Is All Around Pharaoh's daughter took him up and nourished him for his own son Moses was not born an Egyptian he was born a Hebrew amen when he was taken out and put into the water God directed with a GPS the Ark of Moses all the way to the Palace amen when we reach to the Palace Moses begin to wear a coat a jacket are we together different than a Hebrew jacket Moses begin to wear an Egyptian jacket the very name Moses was not given by his mother it's written in your Bible the very name Moses was not given from his father nor his uncle he was the daughter of pharaoh that gave him the name so he got a name from the [Applause] Egyptian are we together are we together he was so indoctrinated as an Egyptian until when you look at Moses there is nothing about a Hebrew about him he was completely an Egyptian he was a Hebrew under an Egyptian [Applause] clothing are we together are we together let's go to Exodus chapter 2 my friend if we can I'm still reading my scripture let's go to Exodus chapter 2 if you dare you can say amen amen go to verse 15 the Bible says now when Pharaoh heard this he sought to slay Moses amen amen but Moses fled from the face of pharaoh and dwell in the land of Midian and he sat down by a well now the priest of Midian had seven daughters we went through this and they came and Drew water and filled the thr to water their father's flock we clear and the shepherd came and drove them away but Moses stood up and helped them and watered their flock right here we talking about Moses Moses Moses amen amen job to verse 18 and when they came to ruell this is another name their father he said how is that you are come so soon today in other words it takes so long before you come at this time what happened that today you finish early amen amen what happened the business went down the company went down they turned the power off you clock out what happened you got fire amen amen what happened verse 20 and he said to his daughter uh verse 19 and they say a Hebrew an Egyptian a what an Egyptian an Egyptian did what delivered us was Moses an Egyptian no sir so he was so indoctrinated into Egypt until when you look at Moses he look like an Egyptian if somebody doesn't tell you this boy is a Hebrew they look of Moses is an Egyptian Moses is wearing a coat are we together Moses is wearing a coat an Egyptian jacket amen am and this cour he was not an ordinary man he was a priest because Pharaoh's daughter took him are we together are we together the Bible says right here that Pharaoh's daughter took him up and nourish him for her own what son and Moses was learn in all the wisdom of what the Egyptian even his thinking right an Egyptian his speech an Egyptian he attire an Egyptian and was mighty in what in words and in what and in Deeds so whatever Moses does works you can beat Moses in an argument a powerful man amen everything looking like an Egyptian and not only that brother BR I'm saying is this he say Moses with one foot on the throne that's right Moses had to become the next Pharaoh he had the Throne of Egypt there amen one foot from the throne because he was a Mighty Man a powerful man he's working for Egypt he has a jacket he's wearing with many many many abilities amen he's a mighty man he's a priest he's going to be the next Pharaoh he look handsome he's a good boy everything he does is good all this manle of Many Colors around him are we together a son of pharaoh was to become the ruler and he will be the chief Captain over the biggest military nation in the world that was the world at their feet that had the world at their feet Egypt was the commercial nation of the world at that time and Moses with his foot on the throne a young man 40 years old could have went right into it but he chose rather because why he look at the word of God and he seen God made what the promise so if Moses would have continued this path right here what would have happened to him because our path goes through the fth Garment of Joseph brother Bram says this again in the message faith in action he says why if Moses would have took Pharaoh's Throne he would have been known as another Pharaoh he been gone in torment today but he is Immortal among man today because he choose rather and put his faith how into action so something happened to Moses despite all this jacket Egyptian jacket that he was wearing looking like an Egyptian Talking Like An Egyptian reacting like an Egyptian even his gesture is the gesture of an Egyptian until all the Hebrew was taken completely out of him amen yet that Mentor have to be removed are we together amen are we together amen Hebrew 11 verse 24 the Bible say by Faith by Revelation Moses when he was come to years he did what refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter how can a young man with all these ability all Egypt behind you all the Mercedes all the car all the C like everything is behind him all all all all the VIP St behind him he stood one day and said no I don't want to be called the son of the daughter of pharaoh anymore what happened to this man the Bible say a revelation hid him there was a faith that came to Moses amen and when that Faith came to him Moses decid to remove that jacket are we together choosing rather to do what suffer Affliction with the people of God than to enjoy what the pleasures of sin for a season a steeming the reproach of who of Christ where did he know Christ Este steeming the reproach of Christ how greater riches than the what the treasures in Egypt for he had respect unto the recompense of what the reward so something struck this boy the Boy look he say well I want want to be identified with those mad dber over there those slave that are there I want to become like one of them he want to suffer the Bible say choosing rather to do what suffer in other words Moses who was a priest begin to Envy a [Applause] slave are we together he only take Revelation to move you from one spot to the next one it took the dream of Joseph to move him from EGT from Canaan to the land of Egypt to become a slave are we together keep your seat belt I'm still claming with this airplane my friend the Bible says in Act 7 verse 23 and when he was how full 40 years old 40 years old 40 is a special number according to brother Bram brother Bram say so every one of them all them big degrees they were shivering they were scared of that fellow that was Goliath 40 days amen so he boasted like that for 40 days did you ever notice 40 is the number of what Temptation certainly it is Moses in the mountain how many days 40 days come back and was tempted Jesus went into the Wilderness how many days 40 days and he was tempted 40 days is what Temptation rain 40 days and so forth 40 is God's number of what Temptation three is what a perfect number we know that and seven is what the completion but 40 is what the Temptation you know the mathematics of the scripture so at 40 years something happened the Bible say it came to his heart not his head that's why it was a revelation it came to his heart to the oh something struck Moses to visit what his the children of what of Israel and seeing one of them suffer wrong he did what he defended him and Avenged him that was oppressed and did what and smoke the Egyptian for he supposed his Brethren would have what understood how that God by his hand would what deliver them but they understood it so Moses already have a revelation that he's going to be a deliverer but in order to be a deliverer this jacket need to be taken off he begin to express his faith with his action because works is the expression of Faith he begin to defend the slave of an Egyptian even though he look like an Egyptian a true child of God that have received the baptism of the Holy Ghost will defend another child of God regardless of the country he is [Applause] in do you understand what I'm saying are we together are we together glory to God the Bible say and the next day he show himself unto them as they strove and would have set them at one again saying sir ye are Brethren why do you wrong one another in other word he goes back he two he see two slave fighting he say h you in distress fighting so this whooping is not enough for [Applause] you amen not only he was defending but he tried to also get in the midst of him as a pastor to settle the issue they didn't understand his language Israel turn him around amen the Bible says but he that did his nebor for what wrong the one that was guilty amen trust him away saying who made the What ruler and what a judge over us so this guy understood something when Moses came and begin to judge them he say hey who made the judge amen who made the judge and ruler amen who made you our leader amen he rejected that leadership amen because Joseph brother when he came he said I saw a dream that's right all your Chief were bowing down they say hey so you going to be a ruler of it us you going to have dominion over us amen he say I see 11 say so you taking over us so this is the same scenario they telling Moses they say hey so you want to take over us who told you you going to be our boss amen and usually it's those that are guilty that have a tendency to fight God [Applause] leadership are we together are we together the Bible says that this Moses whom they refuse saying who made the a ruler and a judge the same did God send to be how ruler and what a deliverer by the hand of an Angel which appeared to who him in the bush so no matter how much you reject that Authority one day he will cut you down no matter how much Joseph brother rejected to be dominated or ruled by Joseph one of these day they were bowing down to Joseph because God Vision will happen regardless of the circumstances the Bible says in Exodus 11 verse three he says the Lord gave the people favor in the sight of the Egyptian moreover the man Moses was how very great in the land of what of Egypt and the sight of Pharaoh's servant and in the sight of what the people so Moses something happened to him he killed somebody and when Israel rejected him completely like who told you you're going to be leading uh H I mean uh be a leader for us Moses say uhhh my life is in danger here let me run away amen he run away what happened to him brother Bram said God always had someone he could put his hand on Moses was born a Propet child and God ordained that he should bring Israel out under his leadership and before he went down to Egypt before he become a leader before he get to the position God predestinated him to be before he's adopted before he start the very purpose that God sent him to be on this Earth before he went down into Egypt after he was CAU when he was on the desert that morning doing what hurting Jethro sheep we find that Moses moved from a priest are we together are we together and run away from a priest and become a servant to his father-in-law he become gent Shepherd he got a job with Jetro so the very big priest here lost his identity he lost that cat of the Egyptian he he's now back as a Hebrew and as a Hebrew he became a servant to his father-in-law are we together are we together the Bible say he was that morning hearding ship his father-in-law he saw a bush a burning now I believe that was the first appearance of the Angel of the Lord Brother Bram continue he said Moses a Runway servant he was supposed to deliver the children of Israel but he ran away and he didn't know how to do it his military training would not let him do it but one day he did what he met God he was what a changed man and a man meets God he makes him act how different than he ever did act could you imagine Moses how ridiculous when you meet God what will he make you act Billy did you say we had 10 minute about 10 minutes I don't have 10 minutes I have more than 10 minutes here one day he's a shephers a what a prince of Egypt run away on the backside of the desert back on the backside of the desert doing what hurting sheep afraid to go to Israel or to go to Egypt rather and here he is on the back side of what the desert so God allow Moses to move from this good VIP position and to become a servant and as a servant he become a Shepherd like David he begin to keep sheep for a reason are we together are we together glory to God brother BR the Bible says in exod three and Moses kept the flock of Jetro his father-in-law the priest of Midian and he led the flock to the backside of the desert and came to a mountain of God even to what so there was a period of time that Moses have to serve under his father-in-law amen and he serve him as a Shepherd because God had a mystery laying with him being a Shepherd because one day he's going to be the shepherd of Israel so God put him into a job that will prepare him for his future task Moses will lead the flock from Egypt to the promised land and God remove his mantle of Egypt the training of Egypt and put him under a training of a true Shepherd who understand a sheep who also smell like a Sheep amen amen amen before he can lead the people of God are we together so when his St of this period of time this season finished God led him to mount HB to the Mountain of God this is where we are on our reading what happened over there he saw the burning bush what did the burning bush do to Moses brother Bram say Moses became a what a prisoner Hallelujah are we together amen are we together amen Moses the priest became the servant and from the servant he become what a prisoner are we together are we together maybe somebody begin to catch now he became a what prisoner he confessed he could not even what this is where we are finally when God got him in his hand where he could only move where God moved him where he taught him what word he know it he was what the word then he submitted himself to what the word and the Holy Spirit there God harness who Moses to what the will of God so God was molding Moses for his future task and at the burning bush God hold him as a prisoner brother brandham continues to make it more clear he say he seen the word not the ambition of the people or the desire of the people then what did he became he did not want to face what the Egyptians anymore he did not want to face this thing anymore but he became how a prisoner a man 40 Years of running stripping down but then he became a what a prisoner at the what the burning bush so at the Burning Bush Moses became a prisoner from a prince to a servant from a servant to a prisoner amen before he goes back to Egypt and to appear before who Pharaoh are we together are we together are we together before he goes back to Egypt to appear before who Pharaoh glory to God brother Bram say he become a what a prisoner at the burning bush the Mary Moses with all his what intellect the Bible saying that Moses was a m man in word or In Deed down where in Egypt now we are at the burning bush this is what we were reading I just gave you the background of it so you understand so we are in the place where Moses now is a prisoner are we together and God at the burning bush give him two sons are we together are we together God told Moses take your stick and throw it in the ground and when you throw it in the ground what's going to happen it's going to turn to a snake amen so he was a god of Miracle are we together which was the first fool that was given to him are we there and then the second time God told him take your hand and brother Bram say he was the right hand and put it in the bosom which is over the heart Amen in other words the word is going to the heart for the discernment which was the Second Son which was the second po are we together now we are at the burning bush God is trying to send Moses Moses said no no no no no no no no no I don't qualify to this and God say you know what I going to be with your mouth amen and I'm going to send you a your your brother he's also a and when your brother comes both you and your brother I'm going to use your mouth and I'm going to teach you what to do amen let's go back now to Exodus 4 and let's pick up where we stop we were on verse 15 let's go to verse 16 are we together glory to God if you there you can say amen amen verse 16 let's go to 15 so you pick up easily the Bible say and you shall speak to him and put words in his mouth and I will be with your mouth and with his mouth and will teach you both of you what you shall do watch verse 16 slowly you there amen you there amen and he shall be your spokeman to the people are you there and he shall be even he shall be to you in not the word error will be to you you Moses a spokeman Aaron God is saying that Moses Aaron your brother is going to be a spokeman amen your spokeman A spokeman for you amen a we there amen he said Aaron shall be your spokesman Amen to the people and he shall be even he shall be to you instead of a what a mouth are we together so Aaron is not only Moses spokesman but he is also the mouth of Moses amen so the mouth of Moses was a human being am I reading a different Bible am I reading a different Bible amen the mouth of Moses was a human being so when you look at Aaron it's the mouth of [Applause] Moses are we together are we together am are we together amen continue more he shall be your spokesman to the people and he shall be even he shall be to you as what a a mouth as a mouth and you shall be to him instead of what God so Moses amen now is God Amen and the mouth of Moses are you following me is a human being let me rephrase it because this need to go down Moses is a god this God also is a human being amen are you together are we together so God is a human being and his mouth is a human being are we together Moses became God a human being so when you see a human being walking that's God if you have a difficulty it happen in the person of Jesus Christ Jesus Christ was God in human flesh are we are we together are we together so when Moses is coming Moses is a God and the mouth of Moses also is a human being so both God and his mouth a human being God is a human being and his MTH is a human being that's why brother Bram say a prophet is God's MTH piece because God MTH is a human being are we together are we together are we together one person a human being is a God the other person is the spokesman of the God who is actually the mouth of God so a prophet is a mouth of God it's a human being are we together what are you trying to drive there my friend let's go now we got Exodus 16 let's go to Exodus 6 our second thing God a human being amen amen his mouth a human being so the mouth of God is a man and God is a man am amen amen amen amen amen amen then the Lord verse one six say to Moses we're going very good then the Lord said to Moses now shall you see what I will do to Pharaoh for with a strong hand shall he let them go and with a strong hand shall he drive them out of his land and God spoke to Moses and say to him I am the Lord follow me carefully and I appeared to Abraham go ahead my friend and to who Isaac God appeared to Abraham God appeared to be to who Isaac and to who Jacob continue by the name of God Almighty in the name of what God almighty God almighty continue my friend but by my name Jehovah was I not known to them God is bringing a new revelation to Moses he said Moses Abraham appeared to him as a mighty man as a mighty God I appeared to Isaac as a mighty God I'm the Almighty I appear to Jacob as the almighty but there was a revelation that I never show Abraham I never show Isaac I never show even Jacob that Revelation I'm going to show it to you Abraham doesn't know this face of me right Isaac never knew this corner right here I show Abraham myself to a certain level I show Isaac to myself to a certain level Jacob to a certain level by you I'm going to show you more than almighty God I'm going to reveal to you as Jehovah are we together that's why he say I appear to Abraham to Isaac and to Jacob by the name of God Almighty else sh I amen but by my name Jehovah are we there was that not known unto them in other word if you go to Abraham you say do you know a sh Abraham say yes I remember sh when I was 90 years old a 100 years old I was tired Shai came and renew me and I became young again if you ask is do you know sh he say yes I know sh you ask Jacob yes I know sh but if you ask them do you know Jehovah Abraham scratches his head he said what are you talking about if you ask ISAC did you ever hear about Jehovah is say who is Jehovah if you ask Jacob Jacob say I never heard such a name who is Jehovah are we together because God is a human being amen and his mouth also is a human being amen this is the first time God is talking to a human being and telling him you going to be a God I never told Abraham he's going to be a God I never told Isaac he's going to be a God I never told Jacob he's going to be a God but you Moses you going to be a god you a human being being a God to another human [Applause] being maybe you didn't get me well you who are born with sex you have a father and a mother you have a beginning and the ending but you going to be God God through that unbeliever you going to be God through that sinner you going to be God to that Pharaoh that Pharaoh that is making your children suffer you going to be a God to him not me not me God you going to be a God in other world you going to take my place I need the [Applause] rest God want to rest God is looking for a rest he wants somebody to take off and he said you going to take over and I'm going to be watching the [Applause] movie I know it's hard but just swallow it my friend say Amen so you penetrate you aen of course amen with your weaknesses of course with your of course the way you be off the

brother Manan I'm so sorry this quot I put it right here this morning that's why I didn't get the page of the church agent amen Amen brother Bram says that the people who took this Revelation from God became what the living Epistles what read and known of all men for so when you take a revelation the Revelation become you and you become the Revelation the Rival become you and you become the Revival so if somebody doesn't have the Bible they don't have to worry they can just watch [Applause] me I I say something that might shock you there is a difference between a written word and a Living Word a written word you can have it and you remain sick but a Living Word can tell you in the name of Jesus Christ rise up and [Applause] walk Hallelujah The Living Word can tell you rise up and [Applause] walk it is a word which life with emotion in it oh my God oh my God are we together are we together brother Bram say that when the Methodist did what God did what raised up others and so he has gone through what the years until what in this last day there is again what another people in the land who under their what their Messenger will be the what the final voice to the what the final a how yes sir the church is no longer the what the mouthpiece of God remember mouthpiece is a person are we together it is his own what mouthpiece so God is turning to who on her to you he will confound her through what the prophet and who and the bride for the final voice will be where in her yes it is for he says in the last chapter of Revelation 17 the what the spirit and the bride say come the spirit and the what the bride you can't have the spirit without the bride and you cannot have the bride without the spirit so the bride and the spirit are mingled together [Applause] Hallelujah the spirit and the Bri say what once more this world the world will do what hear direct from [Applause] God brother brother Bram didn't say sister tell sister jerusha God bless you that's indirect it's going through sisters to Sister Jerusalem but brother Bram didn't say the word will hear indirect the word will hear how in other word me and sister Jer are talking God bless you in other word the brde becomes God is it too strong is it true TR the word will hear directly from you in other word God now is [Applause] there you don't understand what I'm saying God is saying brother Benjamin where are you at and he unzip brother Benjamin he said Benjamin get out let me teach the devil a lesson Benjamin get out when Benjamin get up God enter Benjamin and he zipping he said therefore come back [Applause] again are we together are we together are we together brother Kelly I don't know if I going to continue this is getting stronger I'm saying but he from God as well but of course that bride will be how repudiated as in the what God is telling Moses I'm going to do something with you that Abraham doesn't know Isaac doesn't know Jacob doesn't know what are you trying to do I'm going to show you that my name is Jehovah are we together what does Jehovah mean what is this Revelation called Jehovah we heard about Jehovah Witnesses what is Jehovah how can God say Moses I'm going to unfold myself I'm going to show you something this one Abraham doesn't know the father of your faith doesn't know this one amen do you see why the devil was looking for even the the the body of Moses because Moses have something higher than Abraham until Moses Israel the Lord your God will send you a prophet like me so Jesus has to be like Moses that's why when you speak about Moses the Jews pick up the stone because you're talking to somebody differently God say listen I talk to Abraham I talk to Isaac I talk to Jacob but to you when I talk to you I remove my glasses so you can see me very [Applause] well I know it's hard my friend put your seat belt one is Jehovah oh Lord help me up oh brother BR says in the message adoption he says in Genesis 2 when he made men he says I am y a h u j u v u h who Y which means what Jehovah what did he mean I am all existing one who created something of myself to be a what son of mine a what temporary and what an amateur a little what one of mine Glory brother Bram said Jehovah means that God created something in his own image in his own likeness something that look like him that came from him and that can take his place and act like God hallelujah don't worry my friend I hope you're going to swallow this brother Bram say Glory he says why he said Jehovah means that he gave man to be a what amateur God so Jehovah is God making human God that's why he thought Moses you GL I'm going to send you over there but with a different Revelation this one Abraham doesn't know Isaac doesn't know Jacob doesn't know it is a revelation of deity in human being Jehovah means God is making other [Applause] [Music] gods are we together let's go to Exodus 7 so this can drop to you oh glory to God oh glory to God if you thereare you can say amen hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah amen am amen amen Exodus 7 if you there you can say amen amen Exodus 7:1 the Bible says and the Lord said to Moses see I you got to swallow this my friend I have made you a what a God to who to Pharaoh if your Bible is different than man you tell me if your Bible is different than man you tell me God say I'm going to give you a new revelation Abraham doesn't know about this Isaac doesn't know about this jacob doesn't know about this amen it's only you who know this stuff Moses say what are you going to do he said you see the way you are with your weaknesses with your trouble with your shortcoming with your up and down with your difficulties with I don't know if I'm a Child of God or not I don't know if I have the Holy Ghost or not I still struggle with this with this do you see you the way you are you going to be a God to that Pharaoh so when I'm sending you to Egypt don't act like a human being when you enter Egypt tell them God have [Applause] come are we together are we together in other words God is removing his his his jacket and putting that on Moses and say you going to be a God to that Pharaoh in other word whatever you say will happen in other word god trusted Moses that he can behave like God so Moses in him has that ability oh my God oh my God oh my God he says go you see I have made you a what a God to pharaoh to pharaoh and Aaron your brother shall be what prophet not only are you a God I even give you a [Applause] prophet so either Moses can talk or Aron can talk and the prophet is a human being and the God is a human being a human being becoming God that is what Jehovah means Jehovah means God is making you God God is Raising you up to a level that you are superior to another human being God is restoring you back to Adam where you become an immature God God is giving you the responsibility to take care of the Earth when he's busy with the [Applause] universe and that was under the law that's why in Revelation 10 the the book came the book lost he said go ahead and get the book and with the book the game is over tell the devil I am God listen do not tempt me you play with me so much but as of today I am your [Applause] God maybe you don't get what I'm saying he's not your adversary he's not at your level tell him that you are not in my level I am your God I created you so you can't fight [Applause] me Hallelujah glory to God glory to God have i l you have i l you my friend sister have i l you We R on taret my god listen to brother Bram he says Jehovah means that he gave meant to be

says unto them how then do David in the spirit in word under the anointing you cannot deny the anointing of David the Pharisees say no no no no no David was the servant of the Lord do you know David was a prophet say yeah yeah yeah yes we know David so do you remember the psalm and whatever David wrote was under the spirit of God the Pharisees say yes yes yes yes Jesus say no problem so now David under the spirit of God under the anointing that you Pharisee recognize amen David in the spirit call Christ that son of David he call him what Lord saying the what Lord say unto who my Lord sit down unto th right hand until th make th enemy what th foot David say you know Christ God was talking to Christ are we together and God told Christ but when God is talking to Christ he say Lord and Christ say Lord are we together put your seat Bel my friend because we're going to lay this seep down amen amen he said then then the Lord said unto the Lord sit th way on my right hand until I make th enemy what thy foot if David then call him Lord how can he be his son in other word how can David call a human being God because Lord means eloh him and that human being you saying me you told me it's the son of David but how can David look at a human being and say hey that human being is Elohim how can a human being be God are we together amen are we together amen are we together amen verse 46 and no man was able to answer him word because the answer cannot come from them it is time to shut the critic MTH [Applause] off and the way you shut them off it is when you become God when you get into D everybody back off even the devil backs off amen he says no man was able to answer him a what a word nether D any man from that day amen from that day forth ask him what any more questions so to finish your question question you need to understand Jehovah you need to understand how can a man BN of a woman a man that had a beginning can be God are you with me are you with me amen the Bible says in the Book of John Chapter 5 Verse 18 therefore the Jews sought to what the more to kill him because he's not only have done what broken the Sabbath but he says that God was what his father what does he mean making himself how equal with God so a Son of God means god a Son of God Is Not What me and you talking a son of man brother Benjamin is a son of brother Mickey but in deity when you are son you are like the one that created [Applause] you I don't know if you're getting that I don't know if you can listen to this my friend in Hebrew 1 verse 5 the Bible say For unto which of the angel said here what at any time thou are what my son in other words Paul is saying when God was talking to the angel did you ever seen him looking at the angel and calling an angel you are son amen amen so an angel is never a son he's a being amen he said he never called any angel you are my son amen D my son this day I have what I begotten thee so even though God created angel God never call never told the angel I have give birth to you because Angel are servant but to the son the son comes from [Applause] within in other words before a son become a son he was in the father so the son is only an extension of the father and whatever happened to the father is by default given to to the child that's why when Abraham PID that L who was in the loans of Abraham already paid T whatever happened to Jesus Christ you are already by default beneficiary of that that's why you cannot go to hell because Christ already went to hell do you follow me do you follow me whatever he did it's already put it unto you it is imputed to [Applause] you you don't have to cry you don't have to die on the cross anymore you don't have to be crucified he did it for you he took your place and you being in him are you with me when he finish the last devil he said it is now what they poke him here what came out and what when water and blood is coming what is happening he's birthing somebody in other word it's time now bues come out I have finished with the devil come out from your hideout come out from your hideout you've been staying here you were in me I was demonstrating you how to fight the devil now you graduated come out quick hand the devil for me when I'm going to take a rest the Lord rested on the seventh day we are in the seven Church ages under the seven messenger with the seven seal a comption God needs some rest give God some rest take your position as a God the PO the PO call himself Victorious which means in the place of the son of man he is an impostor that is our position I am the one who is qualified to be in the place of [Applause] God are we together are we together are we together oh my God he says Thou are my son this day have what begotten the and again I will be to him a what a father and he will be to me what a son and again when he bringeth in what the first begotten into the world he said he's beinging the what the first begotten God is birthing the first begotten the Bible didn't say when he brought the begotten when he brought water if there is a first one is that room close there got to be another one the first one when he bringing him to the way so he means they this is just the beginning of the creation of God that's why Jesus is the beginning of the creation of God in either way a beginning of a species where men are mixed they are 100% man and they are 100% they can be hungry and turn around and curse a tree and the tree wither [Applause] away Hall hallu are we together are we together he said the first born into the world when he brought the first begotten into the world he said let what all the angels of God worship him God told Israel first commandment hear your what Israel the Lord your God is what so how can God bring something out of him and we are worshiping that thing and not him how can you worship a son oh Israel the Lord your God is how many God so that son is what are we together and of the Angel he said who make his Angel what it's a different terminology and his me is what a flame of fire butto the sun he said th so that son not only do we worship Him He also have a throne when John went into heaven how many Throne did he see so was two people sitting there this one here and this one here when John looked he saw somebody sitting on the throne and when he said where is the Lamb John look look he didn't find him then suddenly the lamb came where was the lamb Hallelujah are we together are we together are we together he says to the son thou what oh god oh than so the the son is also a god that Throne oh God he's talking to the son that's why Isaiah say unto as a what a son a child is born unto us a what son a son is given his name shall be what wonderful and what and what and what and what Everlasting what father how can a son be the lasting [Applause] father because me and my father we are Philip when you see me you see who God was in Christ reconciling the word Hall are we together he said that Throne oh God is what forever and ever and the cter of righteousness is the scepter of what th th has love what right and hated what iniquity therefore God even th God who is [Applause] God therefore who God even th God has what anointed thee with oil of gladness above th fellows you didn't get it therefore who God even th God has what anointed thee with what the oil of glad watch the red letter above thy whatow above that what above th brothers so that son is not alone he has [Applause] fellows are you together so that God Jesus Christ is not alone he has fellows that's why brother [Applause] say hallah because he's just anointed above you but you are his fellow he's not a shame for you to call him brother are we together that's why Paul say let this mind let this mind be also where in you that which was where in Christ Jesus way take the brain of Jesus Christ and put that in you that this man be in you which was where in Christ Jesus being in the form of what of God thought did not robbery to be what equal with God in other words God and Christ were one and today under the revelation of Jehovah it is no longer Garden Christ but it's you and God you are also [Applause] worth bud let me finish let me finish this brother Bram say a man is just what amen until he's what fully submitted to God and then D dwell where in that man the what the Holy Spirit not the man but what God in the man does the work so did itself where it is where in the man that is receive what the Holy Spirit you are a what a son I am a br by what by birth and I'm part of Mr and Mrs what BR is where in me and if you become a son or a daughter of God part of the is where lays in you see how the devil robs you say you can't do this all things are what possible to them that what believe no matter what it is you are part of what of deity not a servant what a son and a and a daughter Jesus have done it again you can do it again you did it for Moses under the blood of bull and go but my Covenant is under the blood of the Lamb the blood of Jesus Christ is the blood of bulls and goats can bring a man to become a God how much more the blood of Jesus Christ Church remember who you are be a god through your disease a god through your weakness a god through your trouble a god do your back pain a god through that financial difficulty speak to them talk to them direct them command them God richly bless you let me stop here God bless you you shall know the truth and the truth shall set you you need to know who you are there is a time you can cry amen we understand that but there is a time you have to stand up and say take off the stone amen you can speak to that situation glory to God do you believe that don't look at your excuses don't look at your difficulties amen under the blood of bulls and goat which could not bring men to Perfection could step into a position where God say you going to be God to another human being that was the shadow we are in the ANP
