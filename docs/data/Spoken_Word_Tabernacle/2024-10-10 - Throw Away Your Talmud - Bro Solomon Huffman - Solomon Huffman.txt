let's just bow our heads before the Lord father we're so grateful so thankful that you have brought us here again one more time lord lord it makes me think of the sermon that your Prophet preached just once more Lord Lord just once more father Lord let us lift up our hearts Lord and our our souls Lord before you father because that soul Lord that lays down within these bodies of Flesh Lord that soul is priceless and that's what you shed your blood for father the suffering that you went through for that soul that lays within us and Lord as you call us Lord and as we hear your word Lord from Sunday to Sunday Monday and Wednesday to Wednesday and as we go through the week listening to going back and listening to these messages Lord and and listen to your Prophet Lord and that word is calling us up little by little coming up a little higher and Lord as that word just like that little caterpillar Lord that's crawling on the ground Lord but something stirs within him to go climb a tree and weave a cocoon because there's something in him that has to come forth and Lord there's something in us that has to come forth we have to break out of these cocoons of Flesh and Lord we have to spread our wings and fly like the eagle Lord we can't be bound to this earth anymore Lord just let our wings Lord soar through the heavenly and Lord we just thank you Father for what you're giving to us Lord this spiritual food father and Lord as I was listening to brother Chad on on on the way here father and the message that he brought Sunday that everything that is contrary to this word is a lie no matter what we feel in our bodies what a doctor May tell us Lord what what Satan may put in our minds it's all a lie the only thing that is true is your word and father that is what we stand upon is your word than because you plac that word within us and father we don't want to forget the destruction father that has engulfed this area all the way up through the western part of the state in Tennessee and Lord the the destruction is unreal and father the people that are suffering because of it and Lord the right now in Florida those people there father that are going through what they're going through but Lord the bottom line is your Prophet pronounced judgment on this land because they have turned their back upon you Lord you offered mercy and when mercy is turned down there's nothing that but judgment but father as humans father we feel for them people and Lord we just ask to Lord if there is any Mercy that can be granted father Grant mercy upon them Lord and we just the service Lord into your hands Lord be the speaker be the hearer bless the tithes and the offering Lord and let our hearts burn within us father as you speak to us along the way we just commit it all into your hands and when we leave here father we'll say it was good to be here amen and we look forward to what you have prepared for us already for Sunday father we're looking so forward to that Lord we just commit it into your hands father bless our pastor Lord he the sacrifices that he makes father just bless him abundantly father and his family because they make the sacrifice too and

that you'll do we give this service to you Lord we ask you to help us now as we look to your word we ask in Jesus precious name amen and amen let's go straight to the word and we want to read in The Book of Mark 7th chapter and also in Revelation the 22nd chapter and as you're turning there we just greet you tonight the name of the Lord and always a a great treat and blessing to be here and uh we just appreciate brother Steven and the invitation to come and uh we just want to put our shoulder to the wheel we don't have no new message to bring no new word to bring uh Prophet said it's actually the oldest religion that there is amen and uh we're here just to to be a help to you and encourage you along the way and as the Bible would say stir up your pure Mind by a way of remembrance and so we we just certainly appreciate this church here and uh the open door amen we we're all United under the same word and uh we just appreciate the spirit of the Lord here tonight we just say God bless you I won't prolong the time let's read here in Mark 7 and the first verse the Bible says this then came G or then came together unto him the Pharisees and certain of the scribes which came from Jerusalem when they saw some of his disciples eat bread with defiled that is to say with unwashed hands notice that the tradition of the Pharisees there they they said that they're eating food with dirty hands they're defiled they're eating defiled this is to say with unwashed hands and they found they found fault they a that a good Pharisee always finding fa we got some we got some in the house of God always finding fault with something Prophet said if you look for it you'll find it it's just what the prophet said for the Pharisees and all the Jews except they wash their hands off they eat not amen now some of us working people would just throw us out right there they eat not with their hands eat not because they're holding the traditions of the elders and not holding the word but holding traditions of the elders and when they came from the market except they was they eat not and many other things there be which they have received to hold as the washing of Cups and pots Brazen vessels and of tables and then the Pharisees and scribes asked him why not or why walk not with thy disciples according to the tradition of the elders but eat bread with unwashed hands and me notice the question they're asking this is how we do why are you not walking after our tradition why why are your disciples not doing this in other words this is how our church does it why are you not doing it this way and he answered and said unto them well hath Isaiah's prophesied of you Hypocrites as it is written these this people honth me with their lips but their heart is far from me I say God never let me be that person they honored me with their lips good lip service but their heart is far from me how be it in vain do they worship me I wonder how many people are gathered together on on Wednesday night right now worshiping God in vain in vain do they worship me teaching for Doctrine the Commandments of men for laying aside the Commandment of God ye hold the tradition of men as the washing of pots and cups and many other such things like you do and he said unto them full well you reject the Comm commandment of God that you may keep your own tradition let's read also here in revelation 22 yes sir and the 18th verse you're probably already seeing the direction we want to go tonight uh by the help of the Lord uh here in revelation 22 and8 for I testify unto every man that heareth the words of the prophecy of this book If any man shall add unto these things God shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this book it's a dangerous place to add to the word and if any man take away from the words of the book of this prophecy God shall take away his part out of the book of life and out of the holy city and from the things which are written in the book he which testify these things say surely I come quickly amen even so come Lord Jesus we just ask that God will bless his word as you can be seated tonight and uh I want to take a subject and it may be a little strange strange and it was to me as I was first studying these things but I'd like to title it throw away your toid throw away your tomed now some of you that have studied any uh literature and Judaism you know that there's a book that's called the Torah and there's actually several books in Judaism and the one that they would call the first book of Judaism that the Jews would follow would be called the Torah now in simple words what the Torah is it would be the foundation of the Books of Moses so the Torah would be what the the law was given on Mount SII that was given unto Moses the prophet and then it's compiled into a book that the Jews would observe and that was their that was their law book if you would call it that way and the Torah is what the Jews would observe and now another book would be called the kak which is known or the Tanakh which is known as the Hebrew Bible and in that book there would be books of the prophets in it and and different writings and things in it they would take uh books of the prophets and they would take some uh verses out of the Torah and different uh literature of the prophets and they would compile that book which the Jews would study and the one that really grabbed my attention as I was fellowshipping with some brothers about this uh would be called the toid now the Tet is actually a you can study all these things out online if you'd like to pull it up it's very interesting to study uh but you just give me some Grace as we go through some of this but uh the the tment to me really Drew my attention because it's a collection of uh many anent ranic writings that would extend all the way back even before the time of Christ and all of these writings some of them
