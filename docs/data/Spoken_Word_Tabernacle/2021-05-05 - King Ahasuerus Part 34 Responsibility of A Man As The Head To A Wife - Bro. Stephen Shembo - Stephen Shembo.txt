give the lord a hand tonight amen it looks scary on the outside and can make somebody easily to stay home like you know what there is a storm i'm going to stay at home i'm going to stream but despite that you came in so what a victory blessed be the lame of the lord so god has been burning in somebody's heart amen blessed be the name of the lord there's only one announcement that i have we talked to the hotel manager but for some reason the uh there is like an event coming up on june 5th something like that and those people want to have an event till sunday morning and we explain to them that we've been here for more than a year everything is good and fine we should be getting the priority and then suddenly i was called that you know what they already signed the contract so on that only sunday we might end up having the service at 1pm instead of 11 o'clock so that's the only sunday they're trying to push and get those people out here so i say you know what brother robert i'm going to bring you to the church for prayer so let the church pray just like what happened in brother sean martin something might happen and then we can have service at 11 o'clock amen how many believe that impossibility can happen amen blessed be the name of the lord even if the contract was signed god can turn things around amen but there is one thing brother robert told me say it's the beginning of the end so we're getting closer to go to our building amen so don't get upset just let's go ahead in prayer pray it's only one day and just let have grace from the lord to open the door so we can have a service at 11 o'clock because some people have to rush and go to work and things like that so we want to have it earlier at 11 o'clock one o'clock it won't hurt but i would like at 11 o'clock if possible if not we can work around it just one day amen blessed be the name of the lord can you pull the screen on let's go to our subject i believe everybody is on board everybody have been on page with the sermon how many listen to the sermon on sunday okay so some people are missing okay how many catch up on those sermons on sunday on the sermon on sunday okay you were not there oh you did you raise your hand okay let me start it again how many listen to the sermon on sunday okay blessed be the name of the lord so we good so we're just to take off we don't have to go backward and backward and keep pulling somebody else amen let's go to our reading tonight genesis chapter 3. somebody's faithful strong someone told me please don't get to the high heel until i get back [Laughter] i'm not going to tell you the name so he's faithful strong genesis chapter 3 verse 16. we are still dealing with the hair we already dealt with the makeup we already dealt with the earring and everything we're dealing with the hair because it's easy to just tell you don't cut your hair then when you challenge you don't know what to do now you need to understand why it's not good for you to catch your hair then once you understand it you won't do it amen genesis chapter 3 verse 16. if you're there you can say amen to the what not the man not the man and there is a reason for it to the woman not the man let's see what god says to the woman after the sin sin is already introduced to the woman he said i will greatly multiply your sorrow and your conception so when it comes to conceiving a baby it is not a responsibility of a man it is a responsibility of a woman sorrow with conception that's what he says he didn't say that to the man amen in sorrow you shall bring forth children that's the woman and your desire shall be to the desire of the woman i wish the whole church was here i even said it on sunday the desire of the woman must be directed to who and the husband compared to the woman he's what i'm glad it's coming from sister praise god i thought the brother should say head but now it's the sister amen and your desire shall be to your husband come on and he shall rule over you the husband now has been given the headship to rule over in other words he shall be responsible for you when you need something can you say amen when you need something you go to you ready to get married you ready no wonder the sisters are saying amen amen verse 17 and to who the man that's finished with the woman finish so don't put anything else god didn't put okay to the man what does god says to the man man is he and to adam he said because you have hearkened to the voice of your wife and have eaten of the tree and of which i commanded you saying you shall not eat curses the water you might be seated i was trying to go quick but something is dropping slowly and i gotta deal with it give me a minute because he was not on my note but the holy spirit just brought it to me keep where we are let's go to genesis chapter 2 verse 5 and then we're going to come back there and every plant of the field before it was in the earth and every herb of the field before he grew for the lord god has not caused it to reign upon the earth and there was not water a man to do water ever clear so the responsibility of a man when they put man from the spirit into the body was for man to be able to contact the earth and to tilt the ground because god gave the responsibility of the garden unto the men in other words god gave man a job do you hear me before he got married so don't come in this church to get married when you don't have a job i'm not going to marry you if you need a coach you see me i also have a quote go listen to the choosing of the bride before brother branham married took a couple what what did he do he sat with them and asked them if the men were working where did brother branham get that he just made it up you learned enough in this church of them in this church about it amen let me get it again because something keeps coming back too my to my mind verse 15 yes lord and the lord took the man and put him into the garden of eden to do what in other words cultivate it to dress it and to do what so the responsibility the grand here was given as a labor for adam we understand how clearly now let's go back to our reading verse 17 chapter 3 verse 17 and to adam he said because you have hearkened to the voice of your wife and you have eaten off the tree of which i commanded you saying you shall not eat of it curses the water you understand now where the the curse went curse is the ground why the ground why they didn't curse the ground for eve they cursed the ground for adam because work was not a responsibility for eve can you say amen work was a responsibility for men let's put everything back in order i'm the head i'm the head let me give you your headship and when i give you your headship you must do what the headship is supposed to do not a head to give command not a head to be the first one to eat you gotta understand what is the head now i will see how you gonna claim it again but you must claim it if god make you a man amen in sorrow shall you what the sorrow of the woman was for the birth not for the ground amen in sorrow i hope those that are not here tonight that are home they are streaming amen in sorrow shall you eat of it all the days of your life in other words the labor of a man become hard it was a pleasure at the beginning now they did something to the ground and he makes it hard amen but jesus when he went on the cross he took that curse and put it in so as a man your work should be a leisure because jesus restored you back to what adam lost so a word should not be a burden for a young man a work would should not be a burden for er for a husband hallelujah verse 18 thorn also and peace which jesus had on on his head shall it bring forth to you and you shall eat the herb of the water off the field the ground verse 19 in the sweat of your the face of who is the woman supposed to sweat she's going to sweat in delivery you sweat on the warehouse we try to switch stuff like this and still you're not going to give a baby you're not going to be burying a baby she's going to work and yet she got to bring your children so she work on the double you see now from the scripture and in the sweat of your face the man shall you eat bread till you return to the ground for out of it were you taken for dust you are and to that shall you return so right here in genesis we understand that motherhood was given to the woman motherhood everybody clear but the responsibility to work was given to the man from the beginning let's go to isaiah 4. like i said you heard me those that are going to come behind you don't have a job don't talk to me about marriage and not just a job that you work 20 hours a week because you're not going to be able to pay the apartment so you're still not ready to get married oh my god you work 20 hours a week 16 hours a week you want to get married i'm going to live in food stamp let me leave that alone isaiah 4 verse 1 and in that day seven women shall take hold of one man i already told you about this saying we will eat our own water so in this time the women begin to make their own bread everybody clear now brother branham said that's the prophecy of the end time in isaiah 4 instead of the man bringing the bread the woman now is the one taking care of her own bread while in genesis the bread was the responsibility of adam you want to see what what what a deadly thing it is with this kind of stuff and i'm going to read it to you from the scripture amen and where you're on apparel who eat your bible so somebody's not in tune here and wear your own apparel our it is their clothing not your clothing the woman take care of her bread she's taking care of her own clothing and you think it's normal only let us be called by your i want to become mrs so-and-so but i am the one responsible for myself you see let him let i want to get married i want to carry your name so they can call me mrs x but when it comes to the responsibility i have it to take away our reproach so marriage is not a spiritual revelation but marriage is done for a purpose and the purpose is only to remove a reproach she just doesn't want to appear among people like she's a bad woman so i just want a husband but i can live on my own don't tell me what to do with my money in that day shall the branch of the lord be beautiful and glorious and the fruit of the earth shall be excellent and calmly for them that are escape of israel and it shall come to pass that he that is left in zion brother obama said that's the bride and he that remains in jerusalem that's 144 thousand shall be called water holy even everyone that is written among the living in water so this is going to be the condition of the women in the end time but there will be a different woman and that woman is going to be the bride she is in zion and the second type will be the hundred and forty four thousand and both the bride and the hundred and forty four thousand receive the same message because the seventh seal to the bride is the seventh trumpet to her ever clear so they're gonna behave differently let's go to first timothy chapter one then we're gonna pray first timothy chapter 2. if you dare you can say amen i wish everybody was here so we can nail this one time he came from the hair and he opened up a different aspect to clean up something a territory of the black dog somebody was slacking on the responsibility amen this is a preparation to the second banquet if you don't clean up all of this you're not going to be a candidate to the second banquet the second banquet is to remove a man completely out amen first timothy chapter two if you dare you can say amen verse one i exhort therefore that first of all supplication prayers intercession and giving thanks be made for all women why men why do we have to do all of this for men why why not women two four kings did they say queens did they say the queen for king's comer and for all that are in authority that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and water in other words pray for the people that are in the higher position pray for the people that hold the headship pray for the people that are the top because if your prayer goes for them you're gonna live a peaceful life if the head is bad it's a terrible things under them if the president is bothered the country is in trouble if the husband is bad the whole family is in trouble if that is bad the family is in trouble if the pastor is bad the whole church is in trouble that's why you pray for the heads is this a good thing verse 3 for this is god good and what acceptable in the sight of god hour so god loves it when you pray for your head who will have all women okay all men to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the water jump to verse nine in like manner also that women adorn themselves in modest apparel we explain this with shamefestness and sobriety not with breaded hair we explained this that was the prostitute on the other town or gold or pale or costlier but which becomes women professing these women are talking number one word professing godliness with water so these women they are not just talking about something but they're also manifesting the life of what they are talking it is word and deed amen but i suffered not a a woman to teach not to observe authority that's why in verse 1 he said you pray for the man you understand now and observe authority not the word exercise authority over the water because from the garden of eden he shall be the ruler make sense so paul stays consistent amen exert authority over the men but be in silence verse 3 13 for adam was what we saw this on sunday remember adam was first formed kama then we know that eve came after the fall that word eve remember on sunday amen and adam was not deceived we understand why the devil have to go there it's a wicked person but the woman being deceived was in the transgression remember in the garden of eden motherhood was given to her look what paul is going to say verse 4 15 not withstanding she shall be what in doing what everybody clear so far you see that child bearing again back again here motherhood conception in childbearing if they continue in water so you must stay in the faith and charity and holiness with water the key here the woman in the garden of eden responsibility conception motherhood childbearing her desire her want what she need she needs to go to her husband anybody clear man was work to bring bread but according to isaiah 4 there is a prophecy that women are doing producing their own bread and taking care of themselves they don't need the man they just need the man for covering to remove the reproach but there will be a different woman with the wisdom of the end time that's going to be different because she will have a message that's gonna make her behave different anybody clear let's pray heavenly father lord we thank you again for your grace your love your mercy and for everything you're doing for us father thank you for giving us another opportunity to gather together around the revealed word of the hour lord i have done what any man can do on this planet earth lord if they have an ability to do so but lord father to come break the word and unfold it you're the only one that can do it lord i'm surrendering myself and this church even those that are streaming unto the hand may the holy spirit come and minister to your children may you move me completely out of the way lord may the devil be sealed out and his devil lord and and his demon angel but may only the holy spirit lord be sealed and shut in this place that you can speak to our soul give us a revelation i'll rebuke every demonic spirit of resentment or that's going to bring a slickness of your own on your children in the name of jesus christ amen god bless you all we are in part 34 dealing still with the air on sunday we showed you the different level we say that the top was crust and crust and gold are the same and crust is the chief shepherd and the shepherd is a pastor so that's why we put it there the chief pastor we're talking about the hair to the woman why is it bad then we talked about the messenger being the pastor of the age we demonstrated to you on sunday then we showed that the pastor is also an elder he's the head of the church and when he come to home either he's going to be your husband if you're married or he's going to be your father amen if you are still under your father or your legal guardian just like he was for esther with mordecai amen and when the bible says that a woman must wear a son on her head about showing a son that she's under power or under authority of the angels brother branham explained to us that the word angel means man and he showed that the man was a messenger which we demonstrated to you that that man is the messenger to the edge to the local pastor and then your husband or your father depending on where you are then we showed you that that authority or the position that was given to man was not a position just to be spoken or to be a position of a proud or just to brag about it it was a position that goes with responsibility and not only responsibility it is a position that must be used with respect and sacredness because being the head does not give you the authority to abuse the woman that's why paul says that with the authority that the lord have given us not to destroy but the authority was given to build up everybody clear that's where we stop and let's go to first peter chapter five i skip this but i cannot skip first peter chapter five if you dare you can say amen blessed be the name of the lord first peter chapter five verse one we're talking about the position that was given was not given for abused it was given for building up to the local pastor everybody clear the elders everybody there which are among you a pastor is an elder i exhort whom i also an elder and a witness of the suffering of christ and also a partaker of the glory that shall be revealed so not only am i suffering but if i suffer i'm gonna be also be partaker of that glory amen verse two feed the flock of god the church which is among you an elder a pastor feed the flock of god which is among you taking the oversight thereof not by water not by constraint in other words not like somebody is forcing you amen it must be a pleasure for a pastor to take responsibility for the sheep they should not force a pastor into the office when a pastor is in the office and trouble is going on in the church it's gonna be a pleasure for that pastor to handle that because god already equipped him from the task amen you cannot call a pastor and then he's like oh my god what am i gonna do no if you're a real pastor amen it's not gonna be that they're forcing you it's a pleasure you have been built for it amen paul says peter says not by constraint but how willingly because you're an elder not for filthy lucra not for money you're not doing the job of a pastor because he pays money no it is a calling amen not for filthy look but of a ready man a willing man you have that heart to serve amen when they call you that somebody is in need automatically you engage without even understanding you already there it's not a burden somebody will say wait a minute he's working too much no it's just him amen verse three now neither as being water god even though you the head of the church you cannot be like a dictator position not for abuse are you there not neither as being lord over god's word so that church does not belong to the pastor the church is the heritage of the lord they gave you responsibility watch how you handling them anybody clear but being water example to the in other words lead them by life anybody clear and when the who you see the pastor now that's the top pastor who is up there when the chief shepherd shall appear you shall receive a crown of glory that faith is not her way why because you have been treating his heritage with respect and with honor everybody here but god is saying here that if my god bless is a pastor that pastor should not be ruling the church like a king mark chapter 10 verse 42 but jesus called them to him and say unto them ye know that day which are a content to rule over the water hidden pagan when a pastor ruled the church like a dictator he is actually ruling the church like a pagan like a gentile like an unbeliever to rule over the gender exercise water god said here do not be lords over them those are the gentle way exercise lordship over them and their great one exercise what authority upon them is a wrong kind of authority but socially not be among you in other words i don't want you to copy the way the gender handle the people that's why when israel said we want to have a king like the other nation samuel got angry god got angry because you want to copy the ways of the pagan the way of the unbeliever the way of the hidden but i want you to separate completely from the kingdom of the heathen because my kingdom is not from this world my kingdom is from above anybody clear but so shall it be not among you but whosoever will be great the head among you shall be a water in other words the attitude of a pastor should be a servant the attitude of a supervisor is willing to come and step down and help you up the attitude of a father he should be a servant the attitude of a husband should be a servant the head is not a lord the only lord and savior is the lord jesus christ because the head of all men everybody creates so far and whatsoever shout of you will be the water the top shall be the water so if you want to be the top just remember you cannot be the top with a caring servant the more you want to climb out just remember pick up the word servant if you don't want to be servant so we cannot give you that top position amen and whosoever of you will be the chiefest shall be servant of all for even the who god himself came not to be what minister aren't you but to do what and to give his water as a ransom for what they had the quality of a headship is somebody who is ready to deny himself somebody who's ready to give himself as an offering as nothing somebody who's ready to dedicate himself anybody care somebody who's willing to serve that's the key for a pastor not somebody who's after money looker not somebody who they're gonna push him because they think he need to be the pastor that's not it that's carnal that's amen because i'm dead i feel i believe this one should be here and they just put it because it's the pastor amen blessed be the name of the lord colossians 3 verse 18 wives submit yourself unto your owner your owner your owner as it is fit in the water so in the lord god wants you to submit yourself to your husband in the lord praise god let's go 19 husbands come on love your water thank you come on and be not water against them authority not for abuser husband love your wife and be not bidder against them still continue children obey your parents in all things because you want the authority for this is where pleasing unto the lord you under authority further provoke not your children to what in other words remember every time you have a position not for abuse provoke not your children to anger lest there be water if they discourage you are not building up anymore your power was given to build up now your power is a destructive power and a destructive power reflect the kingdom of satan because the enemy comes to kill to steal and to do utter you are destroying your own heritage that's the devil the devil take his children bring them to steal something and the same devil called the police and catch the children and put them to prison the same devil he's not building up his children he's there to destroy his children because his makeup is to destroy but you have been given authority not to destroy but authority to build up it is not just marriage and sex it goes beyond that servant come on obey enough fix your water why according to the not without service not hypocrite when they're there you do when they live there as men pleasers but in singleness of heart genuine fearing your master your position your gps is god i'm respecting my husband with my gps in god i'm respecting my boss with my gps in god and whatsoever you do do it hurtly as to the water do you see what kind of stuff we do at work if they tell you jesus need that package how are you going to package it and not unto men knowing that of the lord you shall receive the water remember paul just told the shepherd that if you take care of the flock of god good you shall receive a reward a crown of glory now he's telling here those that are worker he said you shall receive the reward of the inheritance for he served the lord christ but he that do wrong shall receive for the wrong which he has done and there is no respect of the water in other words no no judgment not this is big or not everybody is going to be treated equally everybody clear so far let's go to ephesian five it's a position it's a great position it is not a position like you thought before it's a position that is big because it goes with responsibility it's not a position to give command all the time it's not just about command he goes with a burden with a responsibility amen let's go to ephesians chapter 5 verse 22. let's get to our subject now amen for the husband is the head of the wife everybody understand now here let me go back to 22. wife submit yourself to your honor this is ephesian that was colossian you see how the consistency of the scripture goes amen one to uh submit yourself to your husband as to the water remember the gps you doing it but as to the lord you do it service to your boss as to the lord amen not that your husband is your god amen verse 23 for the husband is the head of the wife even as christ is the head of the water remember over there we already explained to you the top head is crossed the husband is right here amen and he is the savior of the body because the head came in sunset mountain the body is the brain about here verse 24 therefore as the church which is the wife of christ is subject to christ so let the wives be to their own husband in every thing the natural woman always reflect the condition of the church you follow me your behavior as a sister it shows which church you belong to if you belong to the bride of jesus christ the spirit of the bread is the holy ghost that holy ghost will make you respect and obey your husband but if you are only in the building if you are only in the setting of the message but you are not baptized into christ you want to reflect a different woman you want to reflect the woman of jezebel even though you sit in the message church that's why we must get in christ hallelujah let the wife be to their own husband in water in what everything why because your desire makes sense shall be brought to who let's go slowly and no question my papa what about if he tells me to kill somebody relax amen verse 25 husband not for abuse remember his authority not for abuse he cannot tell you to go kill somebody that's an abuse of authority husband do what love your wife remember colossians love your wives even as who also love the water and gave himself for what the way a husband should love his wife that's why i say i wish the whole church was here the way her husband should love his wife is that a husband must be able to give himself for his life i'm reading the scripture you want to get married praise the name of the lord verse 26 that he might do water sanctify and do what and cleanse it with the washing of the water by the water in other words the personal care of a woman this woman is the brother she's the bride of jesus christ jesus christ when he loved his wife he gave himself for his wife and then he takes his wife and wash his wife to remove every unclean thing from his wife the personal grooming of a woman is a responsibility of the man they tell you we need money to buy lotion you get upset personal care if you in that stage don't get married yet amen verse 26 that he must sanctify and cleanse it with the washing off the water by the water watch crust you pick up a woman you give yourself for that woman you die for that woman you wash that woman what is the purpose you do in all of this why do you have to die for this woman why do you have to clean this woman up why do you have to make this woman look so beautiful for somebody else to see her for her to post herself on facebook for help to continually push herself every day on what's happened why do you clean up this woman christ can you give me your answer you ready verse 27 that he might do what present to you you understand when god fixes his wife he fixes his wife to fit his test do you follow me do you follow me do you follow me so the reflection of a woman shows the character of the man that's why brother branham said show me the woman you want to get married i'm going to tell you who you are do you understand me so when christ takes responsibility for his wife he prepared his own wife he beautify his own wife so that he can present his own wife to himself [Music] that he may present it to himself a water how can she be glorious so christ was doing work he was building up that church so that church become glorious amen not having water what a job not a slack job he was really taking care of detail you understand not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing but that should be how holy and without what verse 28 so out man this is the way man should love the wife as their own water he the love of his wife loves his water because the church is the body of christ and this is the way christ treated his own body that's the same way a man ought to love his wife what are you up to brother stephen ezekiel chapter 16. you got it now you got it now you got it now god found this woman you remember she was polluted on her own blood and god came in the town of love you remember and she was claiming this woman to get married to him what did god do to this woman if paul is right now when i passed by thee and look upon thee behold that time was the time of water he was not in precipitation for love because the woman needed work you understand me and i spread my skirt over thee i expressed my intention i wanted confidence with you and covered that water in other words god was responsible for the clothing of that woman anybody clear i'm gonna drop where i'm going here i swear unto thee and enter into a covenant with they say the lord and that becomes mine there is a vow there then washed id with water you remember paul say crust washing the wife okay then wash tidy with water yeah i thoroughly not a gamer not a slack job a very good care i thoroughly wash away the blood from thee and i did what anointed me with water god was taking care of the washing and delotion of this woman are you there let me go then i drop it i close the the clothing also with private work indeed water not only is he responsible for the clothing but he is also responsible for the shoes of his wife are we okay your wife paycheck should not buy her own shoes i wish the whole church was here let me drop that one and continue and in the letter ring d with badger skin and a girded d about with fine lining and coffee deal with sleek a deck d also with ornament i put bracelet upon the hand and a chain on their neck i put a jewel on the forehead the revelation earring that faith in the ear and beautify a quran upon the head that was that was thus was that deck with gold and silver and that remnant was of fine linen and silk and brother work we explained this watch this daddy dwelt eat found water flour and honey and water this god was responsible for the bread of this woman you want to be the head and that was exceedingly exceeding beautiful and that did prosper in the kingdom and that renown went forth among the water so when the hidden sees you because you have been separated from the hidden so when you go outside the people of the world when they look at you they see you different than anybody else who makes that difference that renault went forth among the hidden for that beauty for it was working perfect through my cameliness i am the one that made that woman like that everybody clear which are put upon thee say the lord what in other words god takes charge of his wife and the man should take charge of his wife why because the desire of a woman should be turned to you that's why she doesn't cut her hair hallelujah exodus 21 verse 10 and 11. if he take him another weapon not in polygamy come on hello anybody clear anybody clear i told you i'm going to show you that in the scripture i want to everybody here her arrangement and her what let me put that one again duty in marriage shall shall he not do what continue and if he do this what if he do not these three what what are the trees food remnant and duty of water it is a responsibility of a man to provide these three things to a woman you understand now you must provide food i showed you that in ezekiel you must provide remnant you must prove you must take care of your marital duty if you don't do any of these three unto her then she should go what go out with that free without money marital duty first corinthians 7. let the husband render unto the wife do what it is do and like was also the wife unto the water what god is saying here is the head of a woman must be responsible for her bread the head of a woman must be responsible for her clothing the head of a woman must be responsible for her personal care the head of a woman must be responsible to take care of her passion i'm reading to you the scripture you don't want to be the head you stay away brother branham how can you have faith in your wife if you don't love her that is in failure now how about a gap it to god how can it be if you don't love god if you say you love your water your wife and never do it can you read it loud tell her about it and never do it and do what mary tell duty where did brother branham get that sit down and make love to her express said to her kiss her hug her and tell her she's the best cook in the country all the things that you know and how pretty she is not from somebody else's and how much you love her if you don't do that she shall water never know it that is the way if you do love her you do what you understand now the head is not for abuse it goes with her responsibility responsibility for her bread responsibility for a clothing responsibility for issues responsibility for a personal care responsibility for your marital duty your life work you work amen when your wife need to buy a club use your paycheck not help paycheck do you understand me when your wife needs to buy shoes don't let her use her paycheck use your money do you want me to repeat it again when the bread of jesus christ his dress you understand me her care is christ her dress is christ her eating is crushed her oil is crushed her shoes is crushed everything she is is nothing else but quest do you understand if you get married your wife needs a clothe you buy that cloth if she needs shoes you buy the shoes if she needs lotion you buy dilution if she want to fix her you fix the hair let her be completely down let her be yours when she walk this dress is my husband when she walk this perfume is my husband when she walk the shoe is my husband when she walks her underneath club is her husband first timothy chapter five but if any provide not for her own did he put her there if any provide not for his own men and especially for those of his own water he has denied the water and is worse than water when a man does not provide for his home he is worse than an ephedra it is that safe the lord [Music] you want to get married second corinthians 12 verse behold the third time i am ready to come to you this is paul and i will not be burdensome to you it's the messenger of the age for a sick not yours but you i'm not there after your money i am not looking for you because you're making more money than me that's not what i'm looking for i'm not there for yours i'm not there to get your property i'm not there to get your car paul amen sick not yours but you what i needed is you for the children ought not to do what to lay up for the water but the parent for the water it is a responsibility of the father to take care of the home what did we do we got our kids into job and we're splitting bills with the kids you see what we did we got our kids you got five kids you got four kids you got three kids this one is working this one is working this one is working and you as a father you relax and when the stimulus check is coming you're waiting for the stimulus check of the kids you see what is going on why my daughter is making so much money my son is making so much money it is to the parent to lay for the children 15 and i will very gladly not grudgingly gladly spend and be spent for what paul is saying i am ready myself to be sacrificed and i'm also ready to spend for you that's the responsibility of the head amen taking money putting in a pocket you don't have a building i hope you cut that hebrew 3 verse 4 for every house is built by some woman can you read it with me every house is built by some everybody when you building a home man you are supposed to build your house not your wife your wife is now responsible to buy your house you are responsible to take care of her bread you are responsible to take care of her clothing you are responsible to take care of her shoes you are responsible for her personal care you are responsible for her passion you are responsible to provide a home for your family you demand not the woman because in hidden in eden that was your responsibility [Music] you want to be the head it goes with responsibility every house is built by some men but he that builds all things is who the man is under the authority because the head of men is who christ you understand now and the head of christ is who god even though he's building he's building under god a song of degree of for solomon except the lord built the house because he built nothing they never invented the water so before you build a house you go by god and god help you build the house but it's not the woman responsibility titus 2 verse 4 that they may teach the water can you read it the young women to be what karma to love their water these are women that are married okay come on to love their welcome that's their responsibility karma to be what you have a problem it's on facebook a problem with your husband on facebook all love for the country everybody knows about it you argue with your husband it's all over the message before you know it you even make video to explain people what happened your version of the story craziness to be discreet chest keeper of water who keeps the home who built the house keepers at home good obedient to their own water that the word of god be not water you are responsible to build the homer [Music] she is responsible to keep the house keepers of home so when she's out of the home what happened now we commend you brethren in the name of our lord jesus christ that ye withdraw yourself from every brother that walk how what does it mean if a brother worked disorderly quickly we say oh maybe he's chasing women or maybe he's stealing money let's see what that disorder means withdraw yourself from every brother that walks disorderly and not after the tradition which he received of us which tradition paul did you give to the church we go downtown for yourself know how he ought to follow us for we behave not ourself how paul is saying if a brother walk disorderly you need to withdraw from him because we the messenger we the ministry we didn't walk among you disorderly what does it mean to walk disorderly eight neither did we do what eat any man's water for water those ministers were not after the laity paul did the best to work with his own hand so he cannot be a burden to the believer because it's him who need to spend for the believer eat any man's bread for not but wrote with labor and travel night and what this is the apostle that we might not be water chargeable to any of you not because we have not water it is not that i don't have authority for you to pay me because the scripture says you shall never measure the ox that threaded the cone do you know what it means do you know what it means in other words you cannot tell somebody who work where they're making hamburger and french fries you cannot tell him not to eat french fries when he's hungry that's what the scriptures say because he's there watching food all the time he's gonna get hungry and you give him a restriction not to even touch french fries god said don't do that to a beast because the ox is shredding the corn and the corn is food but if you master his mouth you are killing him because he is tempted by that desire and you still quenching him god said don't do that it's cruel if he is working for you let him eat and god used that paul used that for the ministry and paul is saying that i have a right because i work for you you need to pay me but i didn't want to go that route i want to work to be an example to you [Music] because i'm the head anybody there not because we have not power but to make ourselves an example unto you da to followers for even when we were with you this we commend you what is the commandment that if any would not do what neither should be what that's said for the lord everybody here for we heal what do you people that there are some which work among you how what does it mean to walk disorderly paul walking disorderly working water not at all but what a brother who doesn't want to work he's there on the telephone busy body just talking about any other person thinks in the message he knows about his brother about his family about his family he doesn't want to go to work if you talk too much you need to find a customer service job where they're going to work you're going to talk and they're going to pay you you talking they don't pay you two hours on the telephone three hours on the telephone no pay go find a customer service job so at least you talk you satisfy your passion and they pay you now them that are such we command an exalt by our lord jesus christ that with quietness they work and and what eat their own water we want the man to work we don't want a man sitting in the church not working become busybody doing nothing that's not what man was giving as a responsibility amen as soon as something is wrong for your job as a man you should be looking for another job and praying for another job you cannot be relaxed while things are going down because by those we behave you this is why you get in trouble with your credit card because now you use credit card to compensate your bill because you don't want to work and you're waiting for stimulus check to pay off the credit card but you still don't have job and you're going to go back again to the same thing hallelujah amen so anyhow but oh my it is all right but you need a weakling man i am ashamed of you as a christian brother we let your wife do such a thing as that it shows what you are made out of that's right now women you ought to say amen after fasting at you like that because he is the water brother branham straightened the women but he turned around he said it is you the man you are the one that calls all of this remember on sunday that's right and the way he lets you leave it is his water god is going to hold him responsible for it that's right if you are men enough to take up and put your heart your own house in order god be merciful to you if you a man that is not buying bread for your home and you splitting bills for your wife to be paying the food put your house in order she's the one paying for the food i am the one paying for this if she gets sick who told you to split bills did they split it in hidden that's right because the bible says in the very beginning that he shall rule over thee now she's not a doormat now remember no abuse she is your sweetheart but you should sit down and talk to her and reason it with her and tell her and read the bible and pray together you see the man these things would not be in the church then if you don't water we should not even talk about it in the church we got away from the real thing amen listen here the man is the ruler don't you think you shall rule the house you are not sister the ruler of the house you are not a slave now not abuse he keep putting that you are but you are a helpmate remember on sunday now the man has the rule over his wife and he is responsible solely for his wife god makes the man answer for his water you're going to be answering what is going on in your home amen brother branham the bible tells us that a wife should obey her husband i'm a christian and my husband is a water a sinner he persecuted me in every way that he came and for me not to go to church and read my bible and deny the word what should i do we clear what should you do now listen you are supposed to obey your husband that is the word now if he tells you and refuse you to read the bible go to church or something like that you don't have to obey that that's an abuse of power because he that won't forsake his father mother husband wife or whatever it is and follow me is not worthy of mine no demand our support you are not a man is not supposed to use that authority over a woman just because he is a water no abuser hey god is her ruler above you brother in other words above man the head of a man is who christ you tell me i'm going to obey as long as what you say does not contradict the word because i want to go to heaven amen remember nanaya said trafal you remember ananias told his wife safara to lie the woman went against the word of god god killed both of them he just came down from heaven and if your wife is doing something wrong then you got a right to tell her and she's supposed to listen to you but you have not got no right to beat her say amen and drug everyone say amen do these things no god made man a help mate not a doormat remember she was your sweetheart she should always be white never to touch a woman in the body never never never to the woman every wise woman built this water they say the men built the house now it's the woman building the house what is going on every wise you got to be under wisdom woman build this hair house but they're foolish plug it in down with your own hands your own work destroy your home anybody clear what does it mean buddy stephen many of you know what it is to be away from home don't you i say it's just a little shack but it doesn't take a bit a big house to make a home it is the character on the inside that make a home and i am thankful for a home i look around i hear somebody say isn't that a beautiful home i say i don't know home is not the house it is the order of the house that makes the water that is what makes home no matter if it is a chanting whatever it is if the order is right on the inside and godly it is more of a home than if you had a palace somewhere i rather live in a shanty and be happy than to live in the palace and be water the woman is responsible for the atmosphere of the home you're building your house you're building your home the husband take care of the building because brother brother said the beauty of a church is what the character of the water not the building the pastor take care of the building but the beauty of the church is taken care by the church itself by your life everybody here we pass down the street many times and we see a house and sometimes we say isn't that a lovely home now it might look like a lovely house but a home is the order of the water you see the order that is in it order off the water the order of the family who's responsible for that family under who's that fifth gospel a woman a woman is not meant to have an iron disposition she is according to the holy spirit of scripture to be submissive to the male that is commanded of her woman who is truly female or female will be at that disposition not a dorm but again back again not abuse no real man makes a female a dormant but she will want to be under authority and not rule over a man a man real is not supposed to abuse a woman and a normal woman automatically should be under submission that's why you have a tendency if your husband is driving with you who usually drive the car why you see what i'm saying you order your body respond automatically like that you can drive your kids if your husband said pick me up and make donna when he get there what do you have a tendency to do you leave the javascript why do you leave the driver's seat who told you to leave the jeopardy your body is recognizing that the head is there amen but if you want to drive your husband drive your husband drive your husband check it up sometime if she breaks that image that god made for her she is perverted any man that let a woman take authority has also broken that image and he is perverted both ways that is why a woman cannot wear that which pretends to a man or cut water your hair is more than just this protein she is never to wear garments that you turn to a male or cut her hair when she does she is intruding into the male domain taking authority and preventing water you think you are driving your home you think you are taking authority over your husband you just preferring yourself and when a woman invades the pulpit which is which she is commanded she must not do she shows what spirit is off she is off being a dominating female is water can i repeat it again being a dominated female is water and the seed of the roman catholic church are in her though she may deny this ever so vehemently that's why when the woman the vice president becomes a woman it is telling you who is getting into the united states when the president stands there and behind him it is the vice president and uh what's her name again nancy pelosi two women behind the man it is telling you we under a perversion in the country and that is the seed for the roman catholic because he loves that you are just attracting the roman catholic by putting a woman on top of the position it is not just things happening but modern events are made clear by white i have a few minutes and let me drive this why are these men called angels you ready we know at the beginning god was the seventh spirit you know that better than god in more faith and become visible as a pillar of fire and that pillar of fire was called christ which is the son of god the logos then from that pillar of fire god condescended again and become man in the man jesus christ everybody clear so far then after the death of and the resurrection of jesus christ because he went on the cross first of all he went into the river jordan and that pillar of fire was immorphed into a doth and the dove entered the lord jesus christ because in him do i left the fullness of the godhead how badly then from there he went to gethsemane in gestamine the pillar of fire left him that's why he was crying my father my father why have that forsaken me because the father took off everybody clear then he went to the cross and at the cross he died after he died he resurrected again on the day of pentecost he came back and did what poor himself why because everything that was in god he poured that into water and everything that was in christ he poured that into water the pillar of fire came and broke down into pieces entered the children of god because jesus was the temple of god and we the church become the temple of god everybody clear so far now when you look at this the one who came out from god was a man when he was made flesh he became a man the only time he changed is when he went to the uh to the upper room then he get into his brother but from here it is man man man then class being poured into the church which is the broad then he become a woman which don't become a woman everybody cares so far brother branham now if the church of the living god camera which is the weapon the pillar of the truth that's the church god intended this church to be powerful church brother kelly a glorious church a church that the whole world could look upon as the bride of christ well accepted in his past and to live in such an atmosphere and conduct itself in such a way god will be proud of this church to present it to who god fixing the church to present it to himself at the coming of the he should live in that characteristic in the church and he shall be living that way that is the church a reflection of christ everybody clear so far now brother branham says that this condensation here is called the regular line it is in the message who is this melchizedek anybody clear so far now when god created adam what i want you to remember here god left the spirit eternal god and in warfare into a theophany which is the logos you already know that then god left the logos and he muffled into flesh which is the lord jesus christ then god went at the cross and pierced him on the right on the left side and the poor blood water and the spirit came up and came out on the day of pentecost now god enter a woman which is a church number one is the spirit two is the lord god so the theophany three is the flesh fourth is in this bread everybody clear spirit theophany flesh bread everybody clear now when god created adam adam was first created in as a spirit because in genesis 1 27 we found that on one sunday that when god created man he created men how male and water and female but when he put men in the flesh he was one man and that man was called who adam everybody here so when god created adam first adam was a spirit because god is also a spirit and those that worship him must worship him in spirit and in water praise the name of the lord normally adam should move from here into the theophany you follow me because when god created him he was both male and female so he should move completely from there all the way to the theophany but for some reason i don't miss that step you follow me you need coach you see me instead of adam being a morphe like god and enter his teopony adam by counter bypass his theophany and came from spirit all the way to flesh do you understand me then just like when he came on the flesh god made everything male female male female male female male female he spoke remember on sunday he spoke the elephant came male female he spoke the zebra male female but when he spoke adam on the earth adam came along and god left him alone and god realized that something wrong something was wrong with adam because everything was pale everything was male and female adam in the spirit already was male and female but on the flesh adam became alone that's why god said it is not good for men to be white and what god did he took adam just like he took jesus at the cross he peace jesus said the cross to bring the bread god also pulled from adam on the side a rib and he made what a woman he put adam to sleep amen and the sleep is a sight of a death a deep anesthesia and then he did the same to christ at the cross he put christ on death and he pulled eve amen and then from there god now want to enter his wife make sense now when eve was created if he has a long hair where do you get that now i want you to notice as we are moving on the holy spirit after brooding into man man come up what a beautiful thing he was and then god made the water now she was not in the original creation we explained that on sunday she is a what we explained that on wednesday on sunday she was a product of the product she is a by-product of a man i don't want to get started on that but she is a by-product of men then when she came into existence eve and she was the prettiest woman in all the world leader eve i can see her water hanging water where did you see her brother brother amen another thing that sons of god took daughters of men and did you know the bible never did not sex in angels there is no denoting of sex in angel and there is no place in the bible where there is a water because it started for men man man then when he get to the church god enter his bride that's why the angels when they appear to you they have a form of a man not a woman that's why a woman should not be a preacher the bible word there is a woman angel because a woman is a water a by-product of men and it shall all be the same like adam was both adam and eve to begin with she was taken from his water about here where are you heading now first corinthians for a man indeed ought not to cover his head for as much as he is the water and the water he's not just the glory he is the image and the glory of god when you see man you see god that's why the messenger should show you crust the pastor should show you crust daddy should display crust your husband should display quest every man should display christ pray for every man pray for the king because they are the reflection of the image and the glory of who that's why they need to cut their hair because they represent god but the woman is the glory of water not the glory of god and the bride being the wife of christ became the wife the become the glory of christ and christ had the glory of god which he said father glorify me with the glory i have with you before the foundation then he turned around he said my glory i give it to them now the bride begin to reflect the husband christ and your wife must must reflect you ever clear for the man is not of the woman genesis but the woman of the water man was created first then the pool the woman neither was the man created for the woman but the woman for the water created the woman to be a helpmate to adam remember sunday for this cause because of this ought a woman to have water power on her water a son of authority of her head which is her hair you understand now over here because of the water the word is what angel i'm almost heading to the airport genesis 18 verse 1 and the lord appeared unto him in the plans of memory and he sat in the tent door at the heat of the day abraham and he lift up his eyes and look and lord there was water they were human when the angel came when god came to visit abraham with two angels both god and the angel looked like men not like woman stood by him and when he saw them abraham he run to meet them from the tenth door and bow himself toward the ground and say my water why did abraham call sarah my lord you getting there did anybody got it the bible says there were three men everybody three men they were not spiritual they were human but when abraham saw him he called this man wow now man is called lord and say my lord if i have found favor in that side pass not away i pray thee from that servant genesis 19 1-2 this is 18 1-3 hey back here and there came how many angels on 19 they begin to describe us that not only were they men but they were what these men were angels i'm almost done and they came to angel because one stuck with abraham to sodom at even and lord sat at the gate of sodom remember abraham was at the ten door and lord seeing them rose up to meet them just like abraham did and he bowed himself abraham also by himself he bowed himself with his face to the ground abraham bowed himself to the ground and he said beyond my what why these these people calling human being lords angel i'll call how everybody clear praise the name of the lord likewise peter you wives be in subjection to your own water we seen it with paul in colossians and in ephesian that if any obey not the word any have a husband that is a sinner they also may without the word without preaching to your husband be won by the conversation the life of your wife so the life of a woman should bring a sinner to repentance let's go while they do what why they are observing you they're observing your chest life couple with what as a christian you must always keep respect we okay who's adorning let it not be the water this husband is a sinner he need to be saved peter is saying that if you take yourself and behave as a christian your christian life your inside life have more power on a man than what you're trying to do outward because remember the women the wrong the immoral women controlled by what beauty by sex and by what shape or form everybody clear now peter is saying if you want to gain your husband don't rely like the immoral woman don't control a man by your beauty because beauty will fade away don't control your man by sex he will get tired of it don't control man by your ship because you can gain weight don't become skinny it's going to change these are temporal whose adorning let it be not the outward adorning of playing of hell that was the immoral woman and the wearing of gold and putting on our peril but let it be the water use your power of a christian life to control the husband and it's not gonna be even you controlling him is going to be the holy spirit in you controlling him because greater is in you than he that is in the let it be the hidden man of the heart and that which is not water your form your beauty if you die it's corruptable all of these sex corruptable all of this shape corruptable if they put you on a casket it's all gone there is many of them in the cemetery amen even the ornament of the what a meek and water and a quiet spirit which is in the sight of the lord the water god is valuing more your life than what you're trying to impress your husband with for after this manner watch now in the old time the holy water a holy church women also who trusted in who not in themself the holy women put their trust in god not in themselves by their beauty they never put their confidence in their beauty they never put their confidence because they have a beautiful shape they never put their confidence in the sex but they put their confidence in god adorn themselves being in water they keep their respect unto the lord being in subjects and unto their own what even as who sarah obey who calling him what amen being called what you understand now calling him what lord whose daughter year as long as you do well and i'm not afraid with any water you have confidence in god you're not afraid of anything likewise your husband dwell with them according to knowledge giving honor unto the wife as unto a weaker water and as being ahead together of the grace of life that your prayers be not what do you see why some of your prayers are not going up do you see why do you see why a husband angel sarah what do you mean a man is an angel and they call angel lords that's why sarah said my lord my head my ruler when she said my lord he was telling abraham you my head you are responsible jesus wants to be supreme ruler of your life and the only way that he can bless you is when he become your water take the man give him his position he's gonna bless you a man by nature want to feel like he's under control that's the way god built him make him feel that way he's going to release everything if he feel that you are challenging him then you're gonna go into a marriage of a fight until you learn the hard way if you don't learn the hard way divorce because he will get to a point where he can't take it anymore he would rather go to a woman that is bad on the outside but i respect him versus sitting with you who always trouble him the only way he can bless you is when he becomes your what lord is what and what when sarah said my lord my angel you are my ruler you are my head you own me that's why i call you my husband who made you jesus who has a right to every press in your heart the creator have no secret before what open up your water a woman should have no secret toward his husband speak everything he already knows you to the detail what you're trying to hide but he wants to be more than a savior than your savior he wants to be your water lord is what ruler that is why the church gets in its lukewarm condition that's why you get in trouble you don't understand the headship and you head get in trouble because you don't understand that she is here with you together and your prayers are hindered by fighting each other in the marriage you are hindering your prayer the hair of a woman have a big deep mystery that's what we uncovered that is why the church get in its lukewarm condition it accepts christ as savior but not as water the women there say we're gonna eat our own bread we're gonna eat our own we're gonna have our own clothing but in other words we don't want your headship when you do that you block the blockage because that's the way god operates respect your husband recognize him even if he looks stupid to you do it as unto the lord because god say respect respect let god handle him and he's gonna fix that husband for you don't try to control him i just give it to him because i seen he got nervous you give it to him you know what i'm saying and tomorrow he's more nervous again it's not solving it is not sex it is not beauty there are women there that are more beautiful than you it is not this there is something a character that a man look he said yes that one is beautiful but what i have is a jew she cannot be compared to any that's what you want the man to beat your hand over amen christ want to be lord of your being to rule and guide you that is why he not set the heart to come in for that purpose is to be your spiritual guide and to be the ruler of your water the ruler of your well fair if you found out that the woman's head is her husband how many knows that the man's head is crushed therefore a man should cut his hair because of who because in him in christ was his both man woman and all his both father mother sister brother all but in man it's a masculine alone god expressed himself only like a man therefore he must cut off because of what christ but if the woman is a feminist shalom so he could have her covering her hair because her husband is over her he is her what he her lord means ruler that ruler goes with what abraham you are my lord you are my head you are my responsibility you are my responsible i am under your care when abraham understood that that's the way the old women adorn themselves before the husband they recognize the head the american spirit and the spirit of the world is against this christian principle it is a spirit that is taking the woman and pulling her as the head and you hear people say she is the one deciding you talk to a man my wife desired you talk to a man my wife desire you talk to a man she is my boss no according to the scripture you the boss she is your helpmate but that boss is not to abuse her that boss you are partner together you are working as a companion for life and working together so your prayer will be answered by god she respects you you love her and everything is there and god come and bless us because that's the couple god is looking for let's stand amen amen i went 17 minutes over i have to quench this so on sunday we get into another territory amen you understand here now you understand here now when you're cutting your hair sometimes you did it ignorantly it's a spirit and that spirit is only showing people that if if a man is christian you're telling god that you are not under authority that's what it means when you trim your head we manage it somebody else might not see it you do it yourself in your bedroom but the lord sees you you are rejecting authority authority might be your father authority might be your husband authority might be your legal guardian authority might be your pastor authority might be god himself if father is not there mother is not there a legal guardian is not there and nobody in the family you alone then automatically remember on sunday a widow and a divorce is under directly under crust because he is always there for you when everything fell when the pastor fell when the husband fell when daddy fell when the legal guardian fell there is one head that will never fail that head is always available because he told you i would never leave you nor forsake you submit to the head automatically listen to the head your marriage he's going to handle when you start putting these things in order the devil will try to fight you to show you that you see it's not working matter of fact it's causing trouble it is a test if you stick to it god will always watch over his word to confirm it and to support you you want god to back you up stay with his word because he always back up his word if you cannot meet the two bills in the mouth your wife is working we understand that brother brother gave us those things but always aim don't get comfortable always continue to pray you say god bless me so that i can be in order to your word god bless me because i don't want my wife to be working third shift and i'm sleeping at home you should be sleeping and your wife beside you you sleeping alone when you wake up she's coming you're going out she's coming in and you think it's normal that's not it i can nail more scripture here from the bible but i believe you got the point respect the head the head goes with responsibility take care of your wife let's use your paycheck pay her stuff don't let her own paycheck pay her own stuff it's it seems simple but it may have a meaning when a woman gets her paycheck she uses her paycheck she buys her own clothes her own thing you don't know what you're doing you are building something and someday a thought the devil it's not her the devil will come and tell her what does he do for you you work you pay your own thing he doesn't even give you money that's the devil because what a door was open so to quench that devil take your money put it in the bank account with you with him or whatever you do but let his money pay for your stuff when the devil comes you say you see this it's him you see my watch it's him you see this here it's him you see the shoes it's him he's the one taking care of me then he's locked but don't use yourself because when you go yourself and you develop independency you're going to go through isaiah 4. and it's it's the the devil operate only with ignorance that's why brother branham said to overcome is to recognize the devil in his tactics amen you can pay the two bills the husband is struggling you're trying to help fine keep that order it seems simple yes i need my underneath clothes you pay for it we need lotion you pay you use your own card to pay for it then god sees that i am the one paying for it the husband is holding there and the lord opened up the blessings it seems easy well it's the same money going over and over you are developing independence and when the devil will come to you because he came to the woman when he comes to you brother branham went through a strong trial and he says everything the devil was telling him was right except he could not tell him that he god doesn't exist so he nailed brother branham like look he doesn't love you look your wife dead look your child and brother branham was going like uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh until something speaks like wait a minute therefore i know he's there so when you do those kind of stuff when he come one day you're gonna see a word sleeping up what do you do to me and you don't understand where he came from he was building up slowly you didn't understand amen the man is responsible for the woman young people work hard work hard before you get married work hard let's pray heavenly father lord we thank you again for your grace for your love your mercy and for everything we're doing for you and you know everything you are doing for us father thinks much seems like it's impossible like it's difficult due to the age that we are living in father how can we believe a god that can split the water of the red sin too we talk about these things but many of us probably none of us has been at the red sea to see how the red sea looks and probably if you ask them a question do you believe i can split this water left and right and israel went under in the dry ground then we're going to realize how powerful you are regardless of the obstacle father that's what i want the church to understand regardless of what the country is regardless of what the circumstances and the difficulties are we can only take you extra word father you can do above everything that we can even conceive on things because you the god that is the same yesterday today and forever lord i know the devil will try to fight many of them trying to tell them that if you try to do this it's not going to work but this is the word of god obedience only will bring power because father you're gonna watch over your word father you need that branch that remaining branch that can express you completely in the pureness in the holiness father because that's what you're looking for to go to the rapture lord father i commit this sermon onto the hand i commit the heads of this church and to the hand i commit the husband and the young men i commit the sister unto the hand lord so that lord father that the holy spirit can continue to minister to us and father bring us to a more complete revelation to understand that this is not the pastor this is not because he can afford he's a dentist but this is the word of god it is mercy trying to put our life in order sometimes we struggle in our marriages and we don't understand where the struggle comes from and is those little petty stuff that we took off the road and the devil has been buffeting our life left and right lord are committed unto the hand touch the family touch the sister touch the brother bless them lord and may you give us power to leave your word in the name of jesus christ

watching this movie and it was a christian movie but it was about this lady who been through like really rough patches in life and so she was trying to change and the people were praying for her and so she had trouble with fear and so they asked her they said ask the lord to show you where that fear began beginning your life and as soon as they said that i began to cry i just i broke down and i was just like oh my goodness because i've struggled with fear for a very long time in life and i was like where did it start from and i went it went all the way back you know to toddler age and i just broke down about everything about fear about resentment about doubt it was like it all stemmed from that place and so i just felt led to give a testimony of how god delivered me you know even when you're not expecting it god just is so good and we have to go back to where it started so i just wanted to give that testimony amen praise the lord amen praise the lord thank you lord amen thank you jesus amen as the dismissal prayer has already been made and we respond to the lord in our hearts just take the name of jesus with you we all dismissed amen take the name of jesus with you child of sorrow and of woe it will joy it will joy and comfort gave you
