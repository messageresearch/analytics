========================================

I have plenty of time. &gt;&gt; I don't know what kind of gear you guys are changing now. It looks like we're moving faster. I don't know. Amen. LISTEN TO BROTHER BRHAM. HE SAYS YOU KNOW FAITH COMETH BY WHAT? &gt;&gt; HEARING. &gt;&gt; What does hearing means? &gt;&gt; Talking about it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Faith cometh by what? &gt;&gt; Hearing &gt;&gt; meaning what? &gt;&gt; TALKING ABOUT IT. &gt;&gt; SO IF YOU DON'T TALK ABOUT HIM, HOW IS PHARAOH GOING TO HAVE FAITH? &gt;&gt; BECAUSE WHEN THE BATTLER SPOKE, PHARAOH SAID, "BRING HIM QUICKLY." IN OTHER WORDS, PHARAOH HAD FAITH &gt;&gt; BECAUSE SOMEBODY SPOKE. &gt;&gt; HOW IS YOUR BOSS GOING TO HAVE FAITH? &gt;&gt; HOW IS YOUR NEIGHBOR GOING TO HAVE FAITH &gt;&gt; IF YOU DON'T TALK ABOUT YOUR BIG GOD? THE GOD THAT PROTECTED YOU. &gt;&gt; THE GOD THAT WOKE YOU UP THIS MORNING. &gt;&gt; THE GOD THAT GIVE YOU A CAR WHEN PEOPLE DON'T HAVE CAR. &gt;&gt; THE GOD THAT GIVE YOU A HOUSE WHEN PEOPLE ARE REJECTED, DISQUALIFIED. &gt;&gt; WHY DON'T YOU TALK ABOUT THAT ONE? &gt;&gt; HE SAYS TALKING ABOUT IT. WE DON'T DO WHAT &gt;&gt; ENOUGH TALKING &gt;&gt; ABOUT WHAT? GOOD THINGS OF GOD. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; I'm like I'm my friend. Go ahead and read it while I'm wiping myself. Please &gt;&gt; reread it. &gt;&gt; Go ahead, my friend. Yes, you read it. &gt;&gt; Reread it. &gt;&gt; Uh, go reread it again, please. Thank you. You go ahead. &gt;&gt; You know, faith cometh by hearing. &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. &gt;&gt; Talking about it. &gt;&gt; We don't do enough talking about the good things OF GOD. DID YOU SEE BROTHER BRANDHAM say about the bad things that happened to you? &gt;&gt; You do you you you need to talk too much. &gt;&gt; This is what it means. You talk too much about the good things of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; AMEN. SO IF YOU TALK 2 HOURS, YOU NEED TO MONITOR YOUR CONVERSATION &gt;&gt; AND SEE HOW MANY GOOD THINGS OF GOD THAT YOU TALK WITH YOUR BROTHER, &gt;&gt; WITH YOUR sister over the PHONE THAT CAN SEASON THEIR FAITH &gt;&gt; AND SAY, "YOU KNOW WHAT, SISTER? WOULD YOU JOIN ME IN PRAYER?" &gt;&gt; WOULD YOU PRAY FOR ME ALSO SO GOD CAN DO SOMETHING IN MY LIFE? &gt;&gt; OR I WONDER IF GOD EVER DONE SOMETHING FOR YOU. THAT'S WHY YOU DON'T TALK TOO MUCH &gt;&gt; BECAUSE YOU HAVE NO INPUT &gt;&gt; AND THERE IS NO OUTPUT. &gt;&gt; SO CHRIST IS NOT THERE YET. &gt;&gt; SO WHAT IS THERE? &gt;&gt; WHAT IS IN THERE? &gt;&gt; WHAT IS IN THERE IS WHAT COME OUT. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. AMEN. &gt;&gt; IF IT'S POLITICS, IT'S POLITICS THAT WILL COME OUT. SIT WITH A BROTHER, YOU KNOW WHERE HE IS. &gt;&gt; TALK WITH A SISTER, YOU KNOW WHAT THEY ARE WATCHING. &gt;&gt; You want me finish? &gt;&gt; Listen to this. &gt;&gt; TONIGHT, THE CHURCH OF WHAT? THE LIVING GOD &gt;&gt; IS TOOK UP TOO MUCH ON TALKING ABOUT WHAT &gt;&gt; TELEVISION PROGRAM &gt;&gt; AND SOME KIND OF A WHAT &gt;&gt; BALL GAME. &gt;&gt; PUSH THE BREAK. &gt;&gt; Let me straighten up myself a LITTLE BIT. &gt;&gt; AMEN. WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? &gt;&gt; AFRICAN SOCCER, &gt;&gt; EUROPEAN SOCCER, &gt;&gt; NFL, &gt;&gt; NCAA, NBA. &gt;&gt; WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? &gt;&gt; THE WORLD CUP OF SOCCER, &gt;&gt; THE OLYMPIC GAMES. &gt;&gt; SORRY, my friend. &gt;&gt; GOD AMBUSHED YOU WITH A different pastor. &gt;&gt; Let me handle this thing now. Let me let me handle it this now. Amen. &gt;&gt; AMEN. BROTHER STEVEN. &gt;&gt; SO, do we do any sport? &gt;&gt; SO, IF I TAKE A BALL AND I'LL GO SHOOT MYSELF, have I done anything wrong? &gt;&gt; THERE IS A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN EXERCISING &gt;&gt; AND PROFESSIONAL SPORT. &gt;&gt; Please follow me carefully. &gt;&gt; AMEN. THERE IS A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN EXERCISES BECAUSE PAUL SAY BURDENLY EXERCISES &gt;&gt; PROFIT IF HOW &gt;&gt; LITTLE &gt;&gt; WHEN YOU TAKE A BALL AND YOU GO SOMEWHERE AND YOU BEGIN TO SHOOT THE BALL TO BURN SOME FAT. &gt;&gt; THERE IT IS. &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; Okay.

IF THE SISTER WANT TO GO AND PLAY SOME VOLLEY BECAUSE THEY'RE TRYING TO LOSE SOME WEIGHT. THERE'S NO PROBLEM WITH THAT. &gt;&gt; Do you follow me? &gt;&gt; DO YOU FOLLOW ME? &gt;&gt; BECAUSE EVERYTHING THAT YOU DO, MAKE SURE WE DON'T SEE YOU WITH A PENT THERE. LET ME START IT AGAIN. &gt;&gt; If you want to GO TO THE GYM, GO TO THE GYM WEARING LIKE A BROTHER. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; IF YOU PLAYING YOUR SOCCER WITH YOUR BROTHER BECAUSE YOU WANT TO BURN SOME CALORIES, WE DON'T WANT TO SEE YOU IN SHORT. &gt;&gt; EVERYBODY LONG PENT. &gt;&gt; MAKE SURE YOUR SLEEVE ARE GOING UP THIS WAY. &gt;&gt; WE DON'T WANT TO SEE YOU WITH SLEEVE LIKE THIS. WHEN YOU GOING IN THE GYM AND YOU RUNNING, WE DON'T WANT TO SEE YOU SISTER STAY IN TIGHT &gt;&gt; OR WEARING PANT IN THE GYM. &gt;&gt; IF YOU HAVE A TIGHT, YOUR YOUR YOUR SKIRT MUST BE LONGER. &gt;&gt; I FOUND I SAW A MASM IN THE GYM WITH A WITH A LONG ROBE ALL THE WAY HERE. &gt;&gt; A woman m &gt;&gt; IF A MUS CAN GO LIKE THAT IN THE GYM, HOW MUCH MORE MESSAGE?
