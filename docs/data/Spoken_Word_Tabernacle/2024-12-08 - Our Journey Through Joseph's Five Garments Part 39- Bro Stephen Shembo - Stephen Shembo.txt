God richly bless you and Welcome to our YouTube channel and we trust this to be a blessing amen I believe everyone is up to date with the sermon am I believe we're reading our Bible twice a day amen amen amen one chapter in the morning and one chapter before you go to bed we are reading our Cod our church ages 70 weeks of Daniel the seals adoption or somebody is listening to the message of William Marion BR we clear on that one amen glory to God young men meeting we are I'm waiting for the confirmation brother JM and brother Enoch but it's going to be in February 2025 anyway I'm going to say [Laughter] something young Sisters Meeting we had a wonderful meeting yesterday if they clapping their hand it means they really got something really really good because that was fresh from the throne the script I read over and over and over and over and I'm praying throughout the day early in the morning going around and the Holy Spirit dropped that scripture for me to talk to them and now they understand clearly because the woman is the body ask them they will tell you and the man is the head ask them they will tell you so when you go into courtship you're looking for what sisters you heard them you're looking for the head right it's the mystery ask them they will give you the scripture and the quot and everything and you will understand what it means you always pull my time and then before you know it I don't have time I'm running out of time amen can I tell them a little [Music] [Laughter] bit so I have to respect what they say amen amen Matthew uh my kids the second and the third one I don't know where they got this from but uh either it was cooc or whatever so they develop something when someone is having something they are one will come and say can you share can you share and the other will share and wait for a really good meal and then go straight ahead and say can you share so young s say can you share can you share okay I'm just going to share a little bit and I'll keep the other one amen Paul says that the head of Christ is who is God and then Christ but we know what these two are we clear you right and Paul say that the head of a man is who CH and Paul say that the head of a woman is who it's like a hierarchy amen but Paul didn't say the head of Christ is God and stop there he continue on the same verse he said the head of Christ is God but he didn't stop there then he says that the head of a man is Christ and he didn't stop there and he says that the head of a woman is a man amen that's why Jesus say I do nothing is my microphone clear is my microphone clear can you hear me well Jesus say I do nothing except I see who father my father doing it so Jesus has head a head this head is not this scull ask the young sister amen the head we talking about here is not this skull here because Jesus the man Jesus had one but Jesus say I do nothing except the father shows me and me and my father we are so the head of Christ was in Christ [Applause] are we together are we clear that's number one then Paul says we check this one Paul says that the head of a man is who so my head is not this one this house my brain but the head of every men is who Christ and then Paul continue he said the head of every woman is who but what can the man the man that have the head Crist say Amen so women so young sister in the courtship they're looking for the head that have the [Applause] head so they one that will qualify to marry you is a man that have trust if the man doesn't have TR cut him off you need a genuine [Applause] believer that's why Paul say follow as a follow CHR so when you follow the husband you are not following your husband you are following Christ in your husband [Applause] now you won't Force the woman to obey you because the woman is obeying the Christ in you you won't force your husband to love you because husband love your wife as has loved how can you love your wife like Christ if you don't have Christ the young sister T me to give you only a little bit so I stop right here the remaining you need to consult the young sisters they're the only one that can give you the remaining amen amen amen so next young sisters meeing will be on on February 2025 young man February young sister February but young men comes first because they are way behind February 1st young man you heard it amen we clear on that one okay for this month on December the 14th which is this coming Saturday it's our question and answer and then December the 21st which is two weeks from today it's our Merit couple meeting part 4 amen

there all the way to midnight amen so we have a flavor of preacher moving on and one will preach a little bit harder and then we will enjoy all the good singing sister give everything sister yoked sister Lily Sister zadi Sister Victoria sister sister sister sister sister even if I didn't call your name you know who you are we will enjoy all the and brother Angelo all the brother everybody all the singer we will enjoy you that night amen so Ed of :00 all the way to midnight and we will get our Lord supper that day we clear on that one we clear on that one okay now next year things are changing because the we are moving into a different direction we took four years of intensive work where we had to lay the foundation of this church you should not have any question at this time we went everything is on YouTube YouTube the majority of them I can say 80% is on YouTube why we don't wear earring it's on YouTube we give you scripture we give you quot why our skirt have to be longer we give you scripture and we give you quote why we don't wear makeup why we don't wear this why we don't do this why we doing all of this why do we believe things the way we believe I took scripture on the unchanging pattern and I went scripture by scripture so the foundation is already laid there so if you come and ask me a question I tell you go back on YouTube you will see it for free you can review you can pick up the note and move on that was the years where we were laying the foundation now the corner I'm changing the corner because I'm taking a different direction following the spirit of the Lord that has been said next year we have question and answer every three month if you heard me okay so whoever missed those question and answer you will begin to remind me if you ask me a question say go see that question and answer we see it over there amen so question and answer no more every month now question and answer every three mon so if you miss it again then there is nothing I can do you need to see the Deacon and talk to them and visit their home so they can give it to you and everything so next year question and answer January after January the next one will be in April and the next one so we have only four question and answer in a year any question so far are we clear and the next couple meetings one is now in December the 21st I thought in December I will finish but things continue to open up and open up and open up I don't have any choice I have to deliver what the Lord give to me so the next couple meeting will be in March so December part four March part five then we seal this subject completely so you have any more question continue to put your question in a question box then we will deal with it so now you have three month to prepare if you miss it's not me for question and answer you have three months for one question and answer to prepare so if you don't show up it's not me I did the best to be available the best that I can four years back to back to make sure you are well furnished and well prepared and everything is settled pretty good so if you've been missing this and missing this and missing this and when trial comes you begin to struggle it is not my fault you're the one that didn't manage your time God is Sovereign amen the sovereignty of God is something we need to understand I don't know if you understand what I'm saying in other word when God speak to me I cannot tell God wait till I get home and you can give it to me because God is Sovereign so whenever I'm going an inspiration can come amen I might be driving a car and the inspiration dropped because I was praying so when it drop every time I'm going to stop quickly I will pull my phone and write down whatever I receive I will not tell God no not now wait when I finish when I sleep I wake up then you come and give me inspiration that's not the way God operate God is s in other words certain things that God want you to hear at a certain time you need to make an effort that's right to seize the opportunity and the time that God want to talk to you because if you miss that opportunity God will continue to move and it's going to be you catching up we all busy we will never have nothing to do in this world we have project and things until the Rapture come and we live but make sure in between those project give God the preeminence amen amen if we say we dismiss church right now everybody here have something to do but we got to put everything aside to give also God his time if you don't learn that discipline you will miss God in many things and when God want to give something you have something else to do when God want to give you something you have something else to do before you know it he found an another Channel somebody who's more available and God work with him and move on Amen so everything on YouTube or the question and answer the Merit couple meeting the Deacon got them they are already reserved there I'm not going to put them on

everything will be okay let's pray Heavenly Father Lord we are approaching you humbly this morning Father thanking you for your grace for your love and your mercy and for everything you have been doing for us father this is the best that I can do with the ability you have given me now we are entering the sacred part when you need to speak to us through the word Lord father Lord I'm insufficient you're the one that knows everything you know the heart of your children and you know what you want us to hear today Lord father may you move us completely out of the way move me and the audience out of the way so that you will be the one Speaking the one hearing the one interpreting the one feeling the one blessing and doing everything be the beginning oh father of this service all the way to the end we thank you Lord father for your presence into this place Lord father May the devil be still completely out of this place May father nothing but the Holy Spirit minister to your children Lord and the elect Angels stand in their position we commit everything unto theiry hand in Jesus precious name amen amen let's go to Psalm 82 I was trying to I thought I finish this and I want to switch the scripture and there was something I left out last uh Sunday I just left it I say I won't touch it I'm just going to leave it alone and I come right out on the parking lot talking to the brother the the couple from London and here come brother mik Deli and shoot it right there I said my goodness I was trying to live this up and now the holy spirit is quickening that to my brother he happen a lot some sometimes you need to be sensitive to the spirit of the Lord he said brother stevenh did you notice this I say oh my God that's exactly what I was trying to avoid and here it comes back again so that's why we're reading the same scripture so thank brother Mike Del he's somewhere you will see him amen let's go to Psalm 82 this is a different road so please stay tight okay verse one God stands in the congregation of the mighty amen you might be seated amen and he there is no end there I'm the one who say end but he the Bible say he because I don't want to add anything to the Scripture it say he who is god with judges among the gods so the congregation of the M if you go inside you will find God's there so he tells you who's in that congregation it's God's now you understand what God is if you don't go back to what brother digs preached he gave you a summary of those things amen he tap onto the teaching anointing he was having a hard time coming up from the pulpit as oh my God you tap into something amen praise God but it was a tremendous blessing job to verse 6 if you thereare you can say amen amen I have said who said God that ye are Gods it should soak in now and all of you are children of the most high amen This Record here we already explain it that verse six speak about speaks about a Divine record amen or a Divine book you remember that I can call this a divine nature of who you are an identification right we clear and this identification is connected to the most high amen it's connected to power and authority because God say that we are gods are we together amen then the second one the Bible say but you shall die like men and fall like one of the princess this one is our natural or our Earthly record amen this record or book or nature or identification amen amen comes from many Nation that's right am depending on where you were born if you are born in the United States this nature will be American right that's correct you will love chicken why because you American you will speak English because you're American are we together you will behave like an American you will think like an American are we together if you born in Europe you will behave like a European if you born in Africa depending on the country that you are you will behave according to that country to that land language and everything according to that but this Divine record here have only one country amen amen amen amen in here we might be different are we together but in here we are one everybody that is here is God Amen there is only One Nation Hallelujah one nationality over here we have only one passport over here we have many passport but this passport won't work over there that's why you need to find your true passport so when we go to heaven you can show your Visa a token so that you can enter sir are we together are we together are we together and this nature here this record here is connected to fall to failure to death amen but the first one is connected to power and to Authority listen to what brother brandham say oh praise be to the name of the Lord in the message communion preaching 1965 brother Bram say like in the book here and the spot there we was talking about the two books being what what brother Bram is talking about two books remember there is a book here and there is another book here amen amen the two book brother Bram say they are one how can they be one Amen brother Bram said the two books being one The Book of Life The First Book of Life coming up was when you were born that was your what natural birth brother Bram says that the first the one that come com first is this one amen this is the book of your life which life natural life we clear now amen but there is another book of your life which life a Divine life amen but both of these belong to one individual amen amen amen so meaning this one could be an American but this one is a Heavenly being are we together Amen brother Bram say the First Book of Life coming up was when you were born that was your natural birth are we together amen you say see but then one time way back down in there there was a little what grain of life so now we begin to understand that this individual has two he has an outside nature amen which is a natural one depending on the country which is American and then inside this person there is another one an inside nature this one is divine because it's coming from Heaven amen amen Amen brother Bram say when you are born this one is quickened oh because we born in sin shaping iniquity coming into this world speaking lies nobody teach you how to lie it's automatically it goes in amen amen but even though you lying and drinking and doing all kind of stuff brother brandham said but then one time way back down in there there was a little grain of life that's right as I was explaining to some of you young sisters at the house this [Laughter] [Applause] afternoon young sisters should say amen that's why we CAU brother Bram because this message it looks like it's still alive and it is alive Amen brother Bram say I was talking to Young sisters at the house this afternoon there is an another quot right there and there is a little grain of Life laying there that you wonder where did I come from what these strange things brother Bram is saying sometime when you were growing up for some reason you stop and you say where did I come from you look at the sky you say who created this Sky they say God God God God okay this is my father this is my mother but before I was born where was I did have you ever thought about that brother Bram said the one that was thinking like that is not the American because the American is satisfi in the United States but it's not you it is the other nature don't know if you're getting me that was thinking in other word automatically Your Divine Nature was calling out for something else but you thought it was you that was really thinking it let me let me re explain again brother Bram is saying here that sometime you sit down as a kid and you say where did I come from okay before okay they say mama I was in my mama's belly that's the way kids talk and then I came out so before I was from my mama B where was I when you begin to ask those question it's a good [Applause] sign it is telling you you have something Divine that is working and pulling for another Nation I don't know if we're together so when you were asking those question automatically the divine nature was in you working even though you were unaware you thought you were the one thinking it today it was not you it was the other you are we together brother Bram say I was saying this taking for myself like you was going to say William Bram well 4 years ago the William Maran brandham is not the same one tonight why if somebody back there would say William brandham he was a rank Rascal that's the nature he was born with see because I was born of who Charles and a Bram I'm reading brother Bram in their name they were American in their nature I was a sinner I came to the word a what a liar and all the habits of the world lay right where in me but in the midst of all this mess down in the two was another nature present that was how predestinated was in there by who God Amen am we clear in the same body to Nature in there how do I know I have two nature remember the question you were asking yourself it was a signal that there is another nature in you that is calling for something higher but you were born in sin born from sex from our parent amen coming into this world speaking lies brother Bram continue he said well I only C to one do you know what the word ker means ask your sister we tell you very good huh C to c means to bring food and drink in a professional way usually in other words you are nourishing that's right you are supplying are we together and brother Bram say he C he nourish one amen amen he said I C to one as he grow so that nature can grow right he good as a baby so when that nature is growing it will begin to act like a baby first amen D first thing you know I become a lion so the more you C to that nature later on that nature will begin to express itself the more you feed that nature are we together that nature will Express itself and then I become a liar become everything else that is a what because I raise up the way but down in there was a little speck of life when all the time is cing to the bad nature make you a professional singer s how about cing to the other nature amen that's why it's important to read the Bible amen that's why it's important to listen to the message amen because now you are turning you are taking your time to begin to nourish or to C the second nature and the more you are feeding that nature it won't remain a baby amen that nature also will grow into a big God Amen are we together are we together brother Bram says this amen he says what was it there was another William BR a living spot of what eternal life down there so you already have eternal [Applause] life I know usually we wait for the baptism of the Holy Spirit and then we say that is when we have eternal life the holy spirit is looking for an [Applause] identification you already have eternal life that's why eternal life is coming to you you must have a part of God for God to come towards you eternal life was already in you and the Holy Spirit uses that as a guide it is used to guide the missile of the Holy Spirit I don't know if you're getting me I told you keep your seat belt friend and know the way we preach is when you go into the Altar and you give your life and then you got the Holy Ghost that's when you got the the the the what eternal life uhuh that is a confirmation that eternal life was already there because if there is no eternal life God won't seal [Applause] you the Bible say this is the Seal of God he knows what belongs to him so God will only stamp God eternal life is compatible to eternal life because God cannot be join to your first nature your first nature you are a liar so God need an anchor and the anchor is eternal life that was already in you put there and God hooked to God the bond of perfection [Applause] are we together are we together are we together before this building is wired to Duke power my friend Duke power is the company in United States that is responsible for power in this area amen before this building is connected to do power the electrician must do work here yes that's exactly amen so the wire and everything is already in place all they need to do is hook DU Power and everything begin to go all that the baptism of the holy spirit is is hook to the work that the electrician God has already performed in your life before the foundation of the [Applause] world this is the mystery of the new birth you all always was a child of God you always was a Son of God that's why you were asking all those questions it was God thinking in [Applause] you are we together are we together if you continue like this I don't even know if I will preach what I need to preach I have a question to enter in heaven you need eternal life the feif F the cross was he baptized did he go to the altar he died at the cross as a murderer asking Jesus Christ forgiveness so which eternal life did he use to enter Heaven which eternal life was he using they got to be eternal life because it's that life that look at Jesus Christ and look at him as innocent when the the cross was condemning Jesus Christ the other said no no no no do not condemn him what was giving him such a reasoning do you think he was a thief he was not a thief he was another one that came up at that time and find eternal life because eternal life always recognize eternal life if you have the head I told the young sister if you got the head in you you will recognize a husband with a head because the two head will communicate they will synchronize a Christian recognizes a Christian and a Christian won't persecute a Christian [Applause] a Christian would not persecute a Christian you persecuting somebody watch what do you have amen are we together oh god brother Bram say there was a little spot of eternal life where down there what is it the genes of God the Gen of your mother the gene of your father the gene of what God my question when did he enter [Applause] there even your mother doesn't know when you were conceived she only begin to see son and the doctor say it's a thre Monon pregnancy but the exact time even the devil doesn't knise this is a mystery in the natural now what about in a spiritual when did God come in other word when you were born God came even though you didn't see him God came you don't understand what I'm saying if you a child of God it tells you from birth God was already there in other words from birth God was having your identification when you are born he open and put it there even though you think he was not there he was there how do you know he was there because he put a part because I have gin amen do you know how many children die in the hospital why didn't didn't you die amen he got in a pool of Bea did he heal everyone he only healed the one that the father shows him so when he goes to the hospital he knows your address when Mom is crying under pen God is just waiting as as you jum you [Applause] go devil try one time you will know who is [Applause] there at the beginning they will Express their anchor they will Express their M but wait for a time let that eternal life Quicken and what happen when he Quicken brother Bram say from the gene of who God the word of God that was placed where in there so what did you have in you the word of [Applause] God my question when did you hear that word when did you hear that word how do you know you have it that's a reason why when they preach the word you will hear something in you say that is right it looks right how do you know it's right [Applause] I don't even know if I will preach brother Angelo hold your Bible hold your Bible I'm in Psalm 82 okay this is where I am I'm in verse one I say God stands how do you know I'm telling the truth can you read it how do you know read over there amen verse one so made2 I say God stand in the congregation am I saying what is right how do you know so the book I have is what you have so so the reason why you saying amen is because we have the same record I don't know if you get what I'm saying I don't know if you get what what I'm saying because you got the word and the word is coming the word will recognize the word what says am man is not true it is when you look in the book you say what you're saying is correct because it's matching my word amen if you never understood this this is your answer that is the reason why the elect will be never deceived because the elect got the [Applause] book there are people who don't know how to read they are illiterate they are blind but when they preach the word they say that is correct so this book is beyond this yes even if you don't have a PhD the book is over there it is more than a natural book if that book say no you will realize later on that that book is always [Applause] right are we together he says it was the word of God that was placed where there each one of you can think of what similar thing see he was doing what working then look up to the tree and I think Lea I see you fall off last year and why are you coming back there again where did you come from what brought you here see it was what that eternal life working in the body so all the funny question that you ask yourself it is only a son that there is another you that is there but the first you that you started with is a natural one you gave more time to that you the time has come for you to tune in to the new you because the new you have power he have authority he have jurisdiction to control even def face [Applause] you yeah God and all of you are children of the most high God that's why brother BR say now I realize I'm no longer a child of Ella and Charles brandham that's right not that he rejected his parent but he understand that there is more than a natural parent that's why the Bible say children are the inheritance of who of God watch your Bible you we were just lone it's written in the Bible it's written in the Bible children are the inheritance of God God just take them and loan to you but they are God's children God is claiming that all of them are my children all of them are [Applause] gods are we together that's why your parent might not believe what you believe in because you are Alan to your parent but you have the original [Applause] father are we together the Bible call him the father of light that's right so he give birth to what because he himself is what any question let's go to Luke [Music] 15 yeah yeah yeah yeah if you don't clear this thing you will confuse the people that's you need to have eternal life you need to have this you have to have the baptism of the Holy Ghost and what are you talking about so there is eternal life there is a baptism of the Holy Ghost if I have two word I mix them together what happened to the water how can you now sit down and say this side is this water and this side is this water how how how can you divide it so if God eternal life come and meet the god in you and the two God mix together which God is God which it becomes what one are we together let's go to Luke 15 my friend you thank brother Michael amen ah you heard it if you thereare you can say amen amen father help me if I can touch this subject verse uh 11 let's go to 11 the Bible says that a certain man you there and he said a certain man has two sons we know who they are right pay attention a certain man has two sons we we have the Elder who is the elder or what the Jews or Israel and the second one is what the Gentile the Heathen the one who did it not God Did It know God Amen verse uh 11 and he said a certain man has two sons and the younger the Gentile of them said to his father father you clear now give me a portion the portion of goods that falls to me and he did what divid he divided them his what living and not many days after the younger son gathered all together and took his journey where into a far country and wasted his substance with what Riot his living this boy went to a far country amen amen let's save time and jop to verse uh 15 follow me carefully my friend you there amen you know what happened verse 15 and he went and joined himself to the citizen of that country he became an American citizen the Bible say he join himself it means that you didn't belong to that country but we join ourself who are you I'm an American citizen he joined to the citizen of that country there are some people that are American but there are some people that are American and divine there are some people that are American role there are some people that are American and they are also Heavenly when they burn America they won't be burned they American will burn with the atomic bomb do you read your message do you read your message okay let me take off America if he scare you there are people who are European and there are people who are European and Heavenly Jesus was born as a Jew but Jesus was not a Jew as a matter of fact he didn't even have Jewish blood sir we together now we okay now we clear right so this person this young man joined to the citizen of that country it was only a temporary residency that's right amen are we together for some time you will go back to where you came from and when you go back you won't say I'm an American we are gods are we together are we together don't worry my friend he says this he said verse 15 and he went and joined himself to a citizen of that country and he sent him into what his fields to feed what if you noce fi this plural I told you to follow me carefully with the youngest son amen the youngest son goes to many Fields that's right Fields plural amen amen plural we clear but when you look at the Elder son follow me my friend jump to verse uh 25 and we're going to come back up now his eldest son was in the what field how many field the Elder one has only one field amen and which was singular amen because Israel has only one location that was given to God by Abraham the land of Palestine the land of Israel Israel has only one location amen but the bride the Gentile that are coming from many different nations because the field represent the world according to Matthew 13 Israel have only one position it's over in Israel in the Eastern country but the youngest son have many field some will come from America some from Europe some from South America some from Australia some from Africa they have many field are we together are we together that's the reason reason why when they were building the Temple of Solomon the material of the Temple of Solomon was coming from different nations but when they came from different Nation they made only one Temple that's why the Bible say ye are the temple of God it's a temple made of people from all over the world and this church is a temple of God people from Africa people from Europe people from America people from this country but when we blend together we are fellowshipping like true brothers and sisters because we come from one [Applause] nation are we together are we together are we together when I meet brother Charles what do we say God bless you what my brother from Africa from United States my brother amen because we going into one church we make one church if you ask him where do you go spoken word where do you go spoken word are we together listen to brother Branham brother Bram says in Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever he say I think when Solomon built the first temple he was cut out from what over the world and did what Shi in cut out from the queries and The Cedars cut up at what Lebanon and flooded down to jopa and hold in by oxcart and so forth and he was so masterly built that when the temple went together he had all kind of little what funny looking Stones so we now going to look the same [Applause] this one reive the word and he's quiet this one Reed the word he can't do it he need to say amen he look funny to the other one and the other one look funny to the other one but we both make the temple are we together my friend are we together my friend and he says but when they begin to read the what ah it was all how in the blueprint so you cannot take me out and I cannot take you out everybody goes in the blueprint are we together the problem is are you in the blueprint if you are in the blueprint that's what matter if you are not in the blueprint that's say are we together brother brandom continues brother Bram say he says it was so masterly built that when the temple went together he held all kind of what funny looking stones in uhhuh but when they begin to read the blueprint it was all where in the blueprint and there was not even a B of A S do you know that it's written in the Bible do you know that do you know that do you know that do you need a scripture for it the Bible says when they were building the Temple the stone were coming from different part and when the stone were coming they brought the stone if you look at this Stone it looks funny this one look funny but all of them are coming for one Temple and the Bible says when they begin to deposit the stone the stone will fit perfectly they don't need a hammer and a cheel to reorganize a stone and put it again together there was no noises so when you are the one causing noises in the [Applause] church we need to watch where you were cut are we together we need to know where were you cut because if you cut correct even if they put you in that position you will blend without any problem and they won't be any [Applause] fet he makes the build the job easy he makes the P the job buy because you were cut right are we together are we together Hallelujah brother Bram say and there was not even a B of A what or a sand of a what Hammer how many years for 40 years you bring this chip it Blends you bring this chip It Blend but we if you look this is different than this but they blend together this one eating pizza this one eating Hamburg but they blend let me put it home this one eating fruitful this one eating chicken you put them together they blend and they can Fellowship all day they don't even want to separate because it looks like something is blending [Applause] them are we together are we together if you ask somebody you say who's your friend where is he from he's from New York and what about you I'm from Pennsylvania how do you get get along like this now this is my true brother this is my bosom brother when I'm sick he's dead he even call me to check on me he doesn't see me in church he is concerned why because the two Stone are blending I hope you are reading between the [Applause] line are we together are we together you bring him into the technician he blends with the technician he's not getting there and start batting heads with everybody he Blends correctly you put him with the musician he glads him he looks like he was the missing [Applause] piece he just found his position are we together oh glory to God he says brother brother I'm saying I think that is the way God got his people how all cut out One gots a nature of what one kind one what one another but they are all Christian FedEd what St join together upon the what Chief Cornerstone who Christ Jesus how can you be married to a woman you never seen and never grew up with her how do you blend how do you blend come on and after a while you can't live without one another if you go to your parent house you just stay there for 5 days you say I'm going back to my home I need to be joined to that one what happened two pie [Applause] fitted married people let me go my friend Hallelujah he said Fe it Stone John how upon the what who is what Christ Jesus oh there is the what the main thing so many reject the precious Cornerstone where we are all how built together how cemented together with what God's love that is right what God's love in this church what do we need God's love [Applause] perod you want to do something look at the God's love you want to sing look at God's love you want to cook look at God's love you want to be a truste look at God's love you want to be a deacon look at God's love you want to preach look at God's love because with our love we will begin to hear some noises but when love is there is no noises because love will catch you correctly and put you in the body and you fit without any [Applause] [Music] problem amen what is the nationality of spoken word Tabernacle it's a Heavenly [Applause] nationality are we together amen are we together brother Steven you told us that the theme today is the C and the KY when are you going to get to that are we together are we together let's go to verse 20 so let's get into that oh father have mercy on me mercy because of time amen amen Oh Glory to God if you there you can say amen amen verse 20 you know the story in between amen the Bible say and the son oh sorry and he arose and came to the his father but what happened when he was yet a great way off uhhuh you know the story his father saw him follow me and had compassion you know what it means and R you know what it means and fell on his neck and kissed him and the son said to him father I have Sinn against Heaven repentance and in your sight and I'm no more worthy to be called your son you know what it means amen yeah but it's a contradiction the the father is not even there I already know what was in you body I knew what was in you I was not looking at that first nature that you left home with that's right I knew you going to mess up and I even gave you the money waiting for Satan to finish everything he can do in you so that I can prove to Satan that when you think you got him at best this is my [Applause] beginning Satan you finish with him you put alcohol you put drugs you put prostitution you

Fest Cal the FED Cal hallelujah it's a fresh kill a bleeding sacrifice amen amen fresh kill fed one amen oh so I see where you getting your ttle now where are you getting the word kids are we together are we together jum to verse 29 now you can take off your seat Bel and get comfortable because we're going to dive into something if I can pass this you in good shape okay if not we got to continue all right all right verse 29 and he answering the Elder son say to who his father Lo these many years do I serve you nether transgress eye at any time your commandment and you never gave me a care what does it mean so we have a Fed Cal follow me carefully if you feel that the atmosphere is too too high put your seat belt back up again okay and the second one is a kid yes sir this eldest son the kid belong to the eldest son request amen his request his claim that's right amen but there a younger son never ask [Applause] for the the FED Cal he was never requested [Applause] amen and he belongs to the younger one when I say younger you know who is younger amen maybe you don't get me when I say all there you look at Benjamin when I say look at angel look at yourself they are Jews and we are not Jews are we together are we together now he says you never give me a kid that are not make Mary with who friend you know who the friends are because Jesus say I got this wound from the house of my friend which was the Jews are we together so the oldest son is pulling for a kid but God the Father gave the FED C to the younger one what is going on brother [Applause] are we together are we together before we dive into this let me give you some few instructions as we digging in amen there is a B Vine or a cattle race that is called Ox it is a Bine or a cattle yes amen sir many animal F I mean fall in this category but the one we pulling here today is an ox are we together are we together this Ox here do you follow me when it's a male amen it is called a boo from today you will read your Bible and Leviticus differently amen or in the Bible they call him a bullock now your Bible will change from today are we together are we together and when it's a female amen it is called a cow are we together but when it is Young when it's young it is called a cal exactly right amen amen if somebody want to use the word Bullock for a young one they say young Bullock in other word young Bullock means a calf if I lost you raise your hand you didn't raise your hand but I'm going to repeat it for somebody who shy are we together there is a race of cattle or Bine that have many animals the animal we're dealing with today is a nox Ox is the name but Ox can be male or female when it's male it's called a boo amen or a Bullock in the Bible when it's a female it's called a cow Cowboy right there oh cow whatever you want to say Amen it's a cow are we there milk it's right there amen the Flesh of this is called beef or steak are we together now now that one you will remember very good are we together when this one give a young the young is called a calf some people don't use the word calf they want to use the word bulock so you need to say a young bulock to express that this is really a younger one because these are usually named for mature one are we together I won't go into a Ste because it's not important where are you getting the stuff from Hello William Mar BR in the message Revelation chapter 4 paragraph 319 when brother Bram is reading about the anointing he said the first Beast was like a what Lion of Judah the second beast was like a what a cal that is what is written in your Bible if you go to Revelation it's written a calf you can verify it later Amen brother brother say that is a young o we clear it let me stabilize somebody again in Job chapter 21 I'm using my uh Google I'm using my spiritual Google you can go on Google on your phone me I'm using my spiritual Google amen the Bible say job 21 verse 10 that they bull do what gender because it's a male are we together and fell not and their cow do what Cal this Cal means to deliver because it's the cow who is the female and cow cth and casteth not her what so you can see a boo a male and a cow mama and then Cal which is a baby any question brother stepen this one is clear what does kids mean kids does he mean children William Maran Bram brother Bram saying a man running from the presence of the Lord because after all I kind of feel that you are my or children rather kid F to a god are we together a kid means what so our theme today the C versus the kid or the goat offering are we together kid refer to a what and you are not a goat you are my how is it you are the Lord's lamb that he has let me what are we together are we together so you know what a no mean what a calf mean versus a kid which means a goat so now coming back to our subject oh my God we found out that the eldest son is looking for the God hallelujah if it's too short you tell me my friends and then we close and we let you go brief the Elder son is looking for a goat but the younger one has been given what a cal not only a cal but a what a fatted calf why those two differences let's go to Exodus [Music] 29 glory to godall I pray God to give me time because when you start like this you don't want to stop no sir hallelujah hallelujah it will do you good my friend let's go to Exodus 29 if we can go quickly so we can save time my friend oh God help me Exodus 29 you there make sure you got your scripture my friend I want you to repeat the scripture you there verse one remember I gave you all the detail all the instruction now you getting the spaceship so you already got the instruction if you have uh you are missing something look back to the board we clear verse one and this is the thing that you shall do to them to do what Hall them Hollow means to consecrate God is trying to consecrate somebody Amen to minister to minister to me in the what priest's office God want to use the priest office and he want to consecrate them do you follow me do you follow me who are those that are in the priest office let me go slowly amen he says take one what somebody's not there please look at your Bible my friend amen let's start and this is the things that you shall do to them to hollow them in other word to consecrate them to minister to me in the what priest's office so this concern the

friend I'm already starting now if it's too strong remember put your seat belt amen amen take one young Bullock and what two Rams without what blemish now we got a problem here we got a young bulock or a cal mixed with a ram two Rams amen we got Ram number one and we got Ram number two amen but we are not truly interested in RMS today we are interested in Cal but let's separate them so you can be free amen jump to verse 4 and Aaron follow me my friend and his son thank you Lord God so they're trying to consecrate who Aaron Aaron and who his sons what does Aaron and his son represent before we move forward amen amen look at the board for future second the Bible says in Exodus 40 verse 13 and 15 and that shall put upon who ER the what the holy garments and anoint him and sanctify him that he may Minister unto me in what the priest's office everybody clear and that shall bring his who Sons so it's Aaron and who his sons and cloth them with what coat and thou shall do what anoint them and thou as thou did anoint who their father that they may Minister unto me in the what the priest office so they receiving the same anointing are we together for their anointing the anointing of Aaron and his son shall surely be what an everlasting priesthood an everlasting what priesthood throughout what their Generations throughout what their generation not throughout generation but their generation because they're using the word Everlasting but that Everlasting is confined to their generation but what I want to do here is Aaron are we together Aaron and his children his sons represent the priesthood are we together are we together so to consecrate the PRI I'm going to get somewh God say take one bulock young bulock take a cal and take two RS sir are we together now let's go back where we were jum to verse four now and Aaron and his son you shall bring to the door of what Tabernacle of the congregation and shall do what wash them with water let's keep for the sake of time verse n and do and you shall G them with G remember Moses is God yes Aaron is the prophet yes sir and Aaron and his son and put the Bonet on them and the priest and the priest office shall be for their for a Perpetual what statue and you shall consecrate Aaron and who his sons we clear on that one and you shall cause a bullock to be brought before the T Tabernacle we know that bulock is a young one it's a calf before the congregation before the Tabernacle of the congregation and Aaron and his son shall put their hand upon the head of what the Bullock the young bulock amen and you shall kill the Bullock before the Lord by the door of the Tabernacle of the what congregation are we clear now jop to verse 14 for the sake of time but the flesh of the Bullock the C and its skin and its D shall you burn with fire outside the water it is a what offering so the calf is an offering of what sin I'm going slowly my friend are we together are we together so the C offering is an offering for the sin of the priest [Applause] my friend if I lost you raise your hand I can't play game with this this give rapturing Faith they C when God want to consecrate the priest he didn't say give me a lamb I know when we say lamb I know where you heading slowly he didn't say give me a lamb he said bring me a a young Bullock or a calf and the calf is an offering for the S not of Israel not of the congregation he only belong to the priesthood my friend are we together are we together are we together so the Cal oh the the young Bullock is the sin offering amen of Aaron and his son who are the

because commandment are many but you must sin through a commandment not knowing that you did it oh God help me in other word you are doing something in your life but you are not aware yet that it's against the word or it's against the message until a preacher tells you I don't know if you getting what I'm saying father help us amen help us listen to me listen to me clearly normally a sister

Commandment already exist but you are not aware of it God already gave his word but I was not preach the gospel first so what I was doing I was doing that under ignorance father help somebody I don't know if you are with me he says which ought not to be done and shall do against any of them if the priest that's it again back to the priest that is Anointed do sin according to the sin of the people

be hidden from the eye of the assembly and they have done somewhat against any of the Commandment of the Lord concerning things which should not be done and are guilty when they sin which they have sinen against them is what no so first they will be unconscious of the sin follow me carefully they will sin blindly oh Lord help me and then somebody will come to make them known their sin father the priest will know but accidentally the priest can sin yes every time a PRI a bullock a young Bullock but Israel will sin not knowing it and somebody need to come and to make them identify the sin that they did and they will become aware that oh so what we did there was bad when they are aware they need the sin offering which sin offering do you give to Israel when their eyes are open I don't know if you getting me let's go my friend when the sin which they have sin against it is known then the congregation shall offer a what a young Bullock for what their sin so when the sin of ignorance happened to the priesthood young Bullock when he happened to Israel as a congregation and Israel did something ignorantly blindly let his blood be upon us and our children when they did it blindly because they were blinded somebody will come and make them known their sin and when the sin are discovered you need the Bullock you need the C [Applause] offering if I love you raise your hand are we

Congregation of Israel sin and if the sin is ignorance yes they didn't know and then somebody come and say hey you guys have seen really we did something that was bad amen they say take the same offering that they preach to use do you follow me and give to Israel not a different offering the same offering the same Christ that was given to the priesthood is the same Christ when I say offering

which offering the young Bullock or the Cal if they sin s if a priest sin any kind of way they C the young Bullock if the congregation sins by ignorance the young Bullock but brother Steven what about the kid now let's go to the kid let's go to Leviticus 9 father help me let's go quick so we can move on if you there you can say Amen am verse one let's rise so we can go and it came to pass on the what eth day which day ah spoken word this is why brother dick suffer amen because you get into a different anointing in the eighth day that Moses called Aaron and his son and the Elder of Israel and he said to Aaron take you young C everybody okay now for a what sin offering and a RAM for a what burnt offering you understand this now without what blemish so all this represent who chist Christ ah and offer them before the who the Lord follow me carefully please because we heading now home verse three and the children of Israel and to the children of Israel not the priest you shall speak saying take you a what a kid of what the Gat oh brother stepen I thought they using the same sacrifice uh-uh the same sacrifice is used for ignorance but when they are not ignorant they don't use that sacrifice they need to use a different sacrifice are you following me are you following me verse three and to the children of Israel you shall speak saying take you a what please help me my friend a kid of what goats for a what a sin offering and a cal and a lamb both for the first year without blemish for the what burnt offering if you notice here the sin offering becomes the God so when Israel sin normally the sin offering is a goat but the priest any time Remain the calf the only time Israel will benefit for a calf is only when they do something by ignorance are we together are we together jum to verse 8 my friend we in good shape now Aaron therefore went to the Altar and slew the what for the what which was for who that belongs to him are we clear jum to verse 15 and he brought and he brought the people's whater and took the what which was the what for who the people and slew it and offer it for what as for the what are we together now so when Aaron want to offer something for himself it's always a calf we okay now when Israel have seen any time they always use a coat we clear now we clear now we okay now but when Israel goes through ignorance are we together then Israel can benefit of the Cal let's nail this down and go to the airport go to Hebrew 5 let's hurry now hurry now let's go to Hebrew five now we got all the tap clear let's get now the antitype amen amen

infirmity with infirmity amen and by reason hereof he should as for the people so also for himself to offer what for sins are we clear so the Old Testament priest have to offer sacrifice for themselves and for the people fors it's a cal for the people it's a it's a kid a goat only when the people sin ignorantly amen are we together are we together let's go to Leviticus 7 I mean sorry Hebrews 7 you know Hebrews 7 now you know what it means right you know what it means right let's go now if therefore Perfection whereby the what father we there Hebrews 7 verse 11 if therefore

and God suffer to let the Gentile go and brother Bram said that's the reason why God was healing hidden through voodoo [Applause] doctors I have the quot my friend brother I'm saying no one can heal it's only God but the hidden thought when they go to the magician they approaching God and brother say because of that God honored their faith in the wrong place by giving them healing that's why healing and Miracle is not to sound you in the right [Applause] place are we together are we together but if you are in the right place healing and Miracle will be [Applause] there are we together are we together God suffered the hidden to do that because they didn't know the witch doctor say you got healed and he believe it and he goes he was using faith and God look he say they don't know just heal him and when he goes there he say oh that which doctor knows really had to heal people he was not the Wich doctor because the Bible say I am the Lord that healer oh that is he not anyone can heal

get to that maybe another day he said and God we get the what ignorance but now God commanded all man everywhere to do what repent so the time of ignorance is gone because he has appointed what a day in which he God will judge the world into what righteousness by who that man we need to know that man whom he has what ordained whereof he has given Assurance unto who all man in that he rais him from the what the dead so that man God raised him from the dead who was the man that God raised from the dead Jesus he was Jesus Christ now because Christ came ignorance must go amen amen are we together are we together but remember the priest when they sin under ignorance when the priesthood see under the ignorance he has a fatted cal a cal offering for him but what happened to this priesthood Lord help me Moses when the law was given did what sail he came down and struck the rock that was in his hand and threw it down and broke the Commandment on because of the weakness he had which was what temper Israel made a c Israel made the cal made the Cal Moses came and destroyed because of his temper let me keep that one my friend amen and he broke the commandment and went back showing that priesthood which is what levitical priesthood will be what broken put your seat belt we going to land this plan okay now that priesthood was what done away with which priesthood Aaron's priesthood which priesthood levitical priesthood but now God has what a new priesthood and he has a new what this is it what is it the Bible there is in here it must come from what the Bible our teaching in

levitical priest who did what ceased when at the death of the Lord Jesus now we live in the what the priesthood who is what Christ for Christ according to Roman 10 is what the end of the law for righteousness to everyone that does what believe [Applause] it Christ ended the law amen that's why the father never gave the old the son a kid you are tired my friend I don't know if you get it remember the old son is complaining that all this you never give me a kid the father cannot give you a kid because that levitical law is [Applause] broken and the younger one is still look and the Elder is looking for the old [Music] levitical amen and when the church changes start God changed the priesthood and the Catholic Church came and try to reinstate the priesthood of Leviticus
