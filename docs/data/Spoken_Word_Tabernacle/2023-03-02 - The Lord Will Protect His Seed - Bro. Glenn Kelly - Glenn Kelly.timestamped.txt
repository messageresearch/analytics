[27:23] but your promises will do us no good
[27:25] Lord if we do not have faith to believe

[27:34] father we just pray Lord that we who now
[27:37] have that like Precious faith will join

[57:28] better follow the leadership of the Lord
[57:29] Joelle chapter 2 verse 25 he says and I
[57:33] will restore to the years that the
[57:35] locusts have eaten the canker worm the
[57:37] caterpillar and Palmer worm my great
[57:40] Army which I send among you and ye shall
[57:43] eat in plenty and be satisfied and

[58:18] rain the former rain and the latter rain
[58:21] in the first month Hallelujah
[58:24] you know this is the hour sanctum you
[58:27] know we're looking around we see the
[58:29] prophecies coming forth but you know
[58:31] what it won't be long we out of here you
[58:34] know what I mean you can see it heating
[58:36] up you see the battle heating up but you
[58:38] know I wanted to reach something here
[58:40] before we go there into the scriptures
[58:42] you know but our topic was you know the
[58:46] Lord will protect his season and then I
[58:49] want to say I will you know that's what
[58:51] I've been working with I will restore I
[58:53] will you know when you look around there
[58:56] and it's just a simple little word that
[58:58] but it's powerful when and who it's
[59:00] coming from when it's coming from God
[59:03] and God say I will you know you can
[59:06] claim it Saints you can grab a hold of
[59:09] it you don't have to worry about it all
[59:11] you have to say are God said I will is
[59:15] that right so that's what we was
[59:16] bringing them into this hour here now
[59:18] you know that's a future promise is that
[59:21] right so we're talking about here
[59:24] and I want you I wanted to look at this
[59:27] here by the grace of God because I um
[59:30] got the uh little inspiration here
[59:33] and um
[59:35] if you're writing it down and those that
[59:37] are home of course I don't have the
[59:38] board now so y'all gonna have to bear

[1:00:03] says uh I want to look to restore
[1:00:07] restore means to bring back
[1:00:11] a claim can be enforced now to bring
[1:00:17] anything back to its rightfully owner
[1:00:21] you see that's what happened in the
[1:00:23] garden you know Satan thought he was
[1:00:26] going to get the rights is that right
[1:00:27] but when he deceives even Adam you know
[1:00:31] but we know that the abstract title deed
[1:00:34] had to go back to the original owner is
[1:00:37] that right because God had a plan and
[1:00:40] the plan that God had he had to restore
[1:00:43] things back God somebody hit it before
[1:00:46] the foundation of the world because
[1:00:48] we're talking tonight we the
[1:00:51] predestinated Sea of God uh that's who

[1:01:43] rightfully owner he said where it
[1:01:45] belongs he said therefore some way it
[1:01:49] went away from its rightfully owner and
[1:01:52] can wander around anywhere

[1:48:42] was the Zuzu Street The Upper Room
[1:48:44] experience that was azuzu Street there
[1:48:47] that was not what we have now we had the
[1:48:51] Pentecostal experience by what by the
[1:48:55] opening of the word now bringing us that
[1:49:00] God and through that opening of the word
[1:49:03] not just the letter but the spirit we

[1:49:54] that's why the Lord is telling us
[1:49:56] through the church ages through the
[1:49:58] bright age and that was the son of God
[1:50:01] is that right that was the son of God
[1:50:03] Ministry so he said over there in
