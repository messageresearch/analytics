TRANSCRIPT
========================================
pretty much lived his life out in sin. But once he had heard of the Bible and God and he lay dying and he said, "Is there one person that could talk to me about the Bible?" Or, "Is there one Bible on my ship?" You wait a long time. Think about that. But God's full of mercy, grace, and they found a boy that they had picked up on the ship and he had a Bible and he told him, he said, "Come in, son, and sit down by my bed and read me that Bible." And the young lad turned to Isaiah 53:5. And it reads like this. He was wounded for our transgressions. He was bruised for our iniquity. The chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we were healed. The little boy turned and he said, "Captain, sir," he said, "Yes, lad." He said, "Let me read it the way my mama used to read it to me." Said, "I read you the way it's wrote in the Bible, but here's the way that mama used to read it to me." Said, "Go ahead, son. Read it the way your mother read it. Said mama used to set me up on her knee and read. He was wounded for Willie Puit's. He was bruised for Willie Puit's iniquity. The chastisement of Willie Puit's peace was up on him and with his stripes will prove Heat. Heat. Can we stand this morning? Let's go to him a few minutes before we uh sing.

I don't know if we've uh I don't know when we sang this last, but you know, the pastor comes out when he prays and he says, "Thank you for your love and your mercy and your grace." &gt;&gt; Amen. And there's a song I saw love, mercy, and grace when we looked on his face that first time. And and every time after, that's what he saw or we saw in our lives. Amen. &gt;&gt; So, y'all help us. I know some of you know it. Go ahead and play it one time. It's a sweet little song. It's very simple. It's very short. I saw love, mercy, and grace. &gt;&gt; I saw love, mercy, and grace. might be his beauty. I look on his face. I saw love, mercy, and graceless again. I saw love mercy. I love mercy and my is I Oh God, mercy. Let's give him a clap offering this morning. You know, when we get to actually see him face to face, it's it's just hard. You know, there's a song I can hardly imagine that doesn't touch it. Amen. Y'all can be seated for just a minute. I do have um a couple of praise reports. My daughter has a um testimony that she'd like to give and we do have a couple of prayer requests as well. So um first um before she comes up, I snuck down to South Carolina this week and saw my buddy that we've been praying about over the pancreatic cancer. He was sitting in a little gas station with a another army guy. We're not army, but he the other guy was he's a friend and um they was eating some fried chicken. So, he looks really really good. &gt;&gt; Amen. I mean, you look at him and he and he made that statement. I wanted when if people look at me, they don't see this thing on me. So, we prayed, all three of us, we prayed right there in that gas station and uh for both of them because the other man said, "I I got issues, too." He was 35 year army vet. So, so, um, we just joined hands and took our hats off and bowed our heads and just prayed right there. And, um, I'm waiting on the testimony. &gt;&gt; Amen. Rebecca, come on up. Let me read these prayer requests as you come up for your testimony. Um, so I got one here from um, uh, Brother Hamilton. You didn't sign it. Is it is that okay? Yeah. Okay. Um, he he wants prayer for his grandma. She's and I had this problem, brother, with my own mama. She was living with us. She's she's leaving her home at night and kind of wandering around among other things. He says, "We're trying to get her out of the house and move her into a family member's house, but she's an old fighter." And brother Hamilton put at the bottom, he knows God will answer his prayers. And that's the truth. That's the truth. And we'll be praying with you, brother. We get it. We understand. and and uh tears at your heart. Brother Greg sent me something yesterday. He's been posting stuff on Deep Water. Um and I had no idea it was about Nikki, Brother Nikki Charik, but you know, we saw videos of everything that Brother Nikki had attained, his gardens and his chickens and and everything. Well, he lost everything in a wildfire this week. Every everything is gone. And so, um, I think, uh, his dad is okay because his dad wasn't where the fires were. Is that correct? He was living in a in a different place at the time, which is good. So, but, uh, it's a big total loss for Brother Nikki. So, um, they're seeking prayer, probably seeking some some help otherwise. And, um, we just want to, um, put it in God's hands. come on up and give your testimony, &gt;&gt; y'all. Um, so I would just like to share this after the sermon we had on Wednesday night. Um, on Thursday at work while the patients were sleeping, I was listening to a documentary of the catacombs of the martyrs that are in Rome. And if you've never seen what it looks like down there, it's the darkest and spookiest looking place full of bones all around, which I believe was to scare the enemy away. But the guy on there was explaining how that there are paintings on the walls that depict the Hebrew men in the fiery furnace and the other known men from thousands of years ago such as Jonah, Daniel, Lazarus, and Noah. As many times as I've read though, Fox's Book of Martyrs and other similar stories and seen similar documentaries, I never knew those paintings on the walls existed before. I just wanted to say that even down in the city of the enemy in what seems like the darkest place on earth, the Christians of those times had the vision to encourage themselves to look ahead in the battle. &gt;&gt; Let's stand this morning. I'm sure we all have a an unspoken on our record on our hearts. Charles, if you don't mind, brother. All right, family. Let us pray. Lord Jesus, we thank you heavenly father Lord for another opportunity Lord God to come together Lord God and to praise you Lord God to give you thanks Lord Jesus Christ to have everything Lord out of our minds Lord God a place where we can rest in your presence Lord God with no thoughts of tomorrow Lord no thoughts of after here Lord God just to bask in your presence Lord God all the burdens Lord God all the the toils and the cares Lord God we just lay them at your feet now Father as we enter into your presence, Father. Lord Jesus, you know, Father, the desire of each and every heart, Lord Jesus. Lord, you know the burdens, Lord God, that are burning in your children, Father. Lord, our precious brother, Lord, a soldier on a battlefield, Lord God. He's lost everything, Father. Lord, we pray, Father, for your mercy. We pray for your grace, Father. Lord, we don't know what the the the the the desire or the the true need is, Father, that you're trying to do in a brother's life, Father, but we know that you're there, Father, for no thing can come upon him, Lord God. Nothing can happen to Job, Father, unless he was ready for that trial, Lord God. Father, strengthen your servant, Lord God. Lord, give him the spirit of wisdom and revelation, Lord God. And let the saints of God gather together, Father, and pray for this precious brother, Lord God, for he's been a blessing, Lord, to your kingdom, Lord God. And Father, you know the desires, Lord, of my heart, my family's heart, Lord God, pertaining to my grandmother, Lord. You know how to work it out, Father. You know how to move just right, Father. And we thank you, Lord God, for a finished work, Father. For before the foundation of the world, heavenly Father, everything that we could ask for was already finished, Lord God. Lord Jesus, we thank you, Father. Now, we pray, Father, for the remainder of the service, Lord God. We pray Lord that each and every heart Lord God can receive Lord God what they need Father from you Lord God. Help us to focus on the word Father. Help us to be attentive to the voice Lord God that speaks to our hearts on today Lord God. Father we pray Lord for the tithes and the offerings Lord God that you Lord use them for the furtherance of your kingdom Lord Jesus. Father we pray Lord for the project that we have ongoing Father. We see that faith Lord God as works expressed heavenly father because Lord there's a manifestation of our faith there father let us hold on Lord to these memorials father because the battle Lord is raging Lord God and we thank you Lord for a word that is sent to prepare us Lord bless your servant Lord take him out of the way Father and use him for your glory and your glory alone Lord God for we look to hear from you in your precious name Lord Jesus Christ we commit all things unto thee in Jesus Christ's name we pray.

So March 14th and June the 6th, that's when we will have our married couple meeting. And at the end of the service, Brother Robert, if you can remind me, Brother Tony, we will pray for Brother Robert and Sister Lorela. No wonder when I look at Brother Robert, I said, "Wow, he's looking sharp. I didn't tell him. When I saw Sister Lorel, I saw the color matching. 42 years of marriages marriage. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So at the end of the service, you let me know so we can pray for them. We can join and just pray for God blessing to continue to bless them. They have been a tremendous help for the kingdom of God. A tremendous brother, tremendous sister. Sister has been always there ready to help and train us and train the other one. And now we got a duplicate of uh we got sister in another version. Amen. &gt;&gt; So by God's grace, thank you for everything. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; I want to thank everyone the trustees first who put up everything together and I know the deacon were there, but John also the song leader, whoever was yesterday, the young man to work and clean up the church and everything. God richly bless you. Amen. God bless you for everything. See, without you, &gt;&gt; it's not going to work. Amen. We need everyone to be there and to be participant. Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm going to say this uh with a lot of respect, but truth is truth. &gt;&gt; So, I'm sorry I was put right where the canon is. So there is no way when I'm driving what I'm driving uh I got to follow the spirit of the Lord. So I'm saying this with a lot of consideration and with a lot of respect. Shake somebody's hand and say God bless you my friend. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yeah. I mentioned to you the reason why I have to say it because I already mentioned to you that I got a I was invited to a uh a banquet, a married banquet. Uh they told me it's going to be 50 couples and they put it there on February the 14th and I was trying to my schedule is very tight but I say okay the only way I can do it is just get there uh do what I got to do and turn around and get get in a flight and come back. So, I already lined up everything and the flight, but I have to change it because I was not aware of something and uh it caught my attention later on that there was a fee that was put there. There was a participation fee that was put there on the banquet. The flyers already gone in the country. I'm saying that because it's not something in secret. It's the flyer are all over. they are going and they have to pay a certain amount to be part of the the the banquet. So the meeting so when that struck me my conscience already something in me rose up directly that I cannot be absolutely part of something like that. Sister Rof, increase my volume so I can blast the devil right here. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; I already told you I'm saying this with consideration. &gt;&gt; But truth is truth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I told the brother, I called the brother. I say I was not aware that this feast was there. I don't feel in me comfortable to be in the place where I have to deliver the gospel knowing that everybody that got in there &gt;&gt; was paying a fee. &gt;&gt; I cannot do that. &gt;&gt; So they tried to work it up with uh uh the their staff to try to cancel. It didn't work up. So I told him I say the way we do it in our marriage couple meeting you don't pay anything. &gt;&gt; The church sponsor everything. We sponsor all the food and everything. But when we open up the door, you can come all for free. &gt;&gt; Where wherever you are in the United States, if you want to attend our couple meeting, just give us a call. Let us know that you're coming and you will come. You don't have to pay a penny. We on part nine never paid any penny for the gospel or for anything. Amen. Brother Branham used to have meeting and brother Brham used to used to sponsor his meeting but the day of the meeting the meeting is open to everybody. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I say so I have not gotten a quote yet where brother Brandham went to a meeting that made him uh they were making people pay for it. So if you don't have the money to do it, do it in the church and take the food out and just take the people to the church and then remove all the food, all the decoration. Bring the people to the church and let's go ahead and do it. So I have to pull back. I cancel the ticket. So I told the brother, we keep in good contact. He understood my point. He's going to continue. Uh as he continue, but he say he would try to organize another one. I say if it's the Lord's will, if you organize one in the church and no one is paying, then if it's the Lord's will, I will be more than likely to be there and to share everything the way the Holy Spirit want me to do. Amen. This gospel is without money &gt;&gt; and without price. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; I do not even believe in worship in musician having concert and before you get in the concert you got to pay. If you don't have money to to rent uh the facility, don't do it. &gt;&gt; Or go outside on the parking lot and put the instrument and let everybody praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Are we together? If we not careful, it's going to be a problem of money &gt;&gt; and then the gift will be advertised toward money &gt;&gt; and tomorrow concert here, concert here, concert here, concert here and it's money after money after money. The gift of God is not for money. &gt;&gt; No sir. Are we together? If it's a night of worship, let it go for free. If it's a conference for free. If it's a meeting for free, question and answer for free. Banquet for free. Marriage couple meeting for free. Young men meeting for free. Young sisters meeting for free. My brother, my sister all over the country. remove the participation FEE &gt;&gt; because at the last minute you don't want somebody to say I was trying to be there and I could not get in because I didn't have diero I didn't have money amen so we respect the brother I share with him my thought and everything so if you don't see me there just understand but if everything is lined up correctly we will do it amen and a lot of respect for the brother, but I have to explain to you. And I believe the Lord allow me to get to catch this thing so we can correct it. And I pray it goes internationally to musician and everybody remove this habit of concert and fees and fees and fees and fees. Remove it. Find a sponsor to sponsor you and open up and let everybody come and get without money and without price. Everybody okay? Everybody okay? &gt;&gt; Amen. And the invitation is open up. If you want to come to ours, just let us know that you're coming so we make room for you. But when you come with our money, with our price, you come for free. You can inform your pastor that's your responsibility. But you're more than welcome. Come on in. We will worship. We will worship together and share the things of the kingdom together. But my conscience I cannot do it. I'm so sorry. Unless one day I find the quote, but so far I have not found anything. I got scripture and I can trace brother Brandham. Even though you don't have a quote, the message have a certain vision and you can search those vision and you can see how things are going. You can tell and predict that I don't think the prophet will go into something like this. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So don't truly brother Brandham say one of the error we do we copy copy things. &gt;&gt; Avoid copying things from one another. &gt;&gt; Always check by the word. &gt;&gt; What I'm trying to do right here, what does brother Brandham say about this? &gt;&gt; Not oh because preacher so and so did it. Because another elder did it. Oh, a big preacher did it. No, no, no. Even if a big preacher did it, push the brake and stop. You say, "Is this in the message?" &gt;&gt; If it's not in the message, I don't care &gt;&gt; how the preacher has been used, how big he is, what a big church he has, whatever influence he have all over the world. I don't care. &gt;&gt; I'm not going to get that because this is a matter of life and death. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So musician in this church never use your gift &gt;&gt; for money. &gt;&gt; Preacher in this church never use your gift for money. &gt;&gt; If they call you, they give you an offering. It's according to the scripture. But don't go after money. &gt;&gt; Don't go knock a door and door and door so they can call you here, call you here, and you say 1 2 3 4 $1,000 I pay my mortgage. Uh-uh. Go find a job. Go find a job. &gt;&gt; I don't know if you're getting me. Go find a job. &gt;&gt; No, I'm going to get you in the United States. Brother so and so. Brother and so and said that one tip very good. H that one is having this and then before you know it's a collection of money. Somebody will stay here three month and left the church alone and he's I mean evangelize. If if if you want to stay six months somewhere, give the church to somebody else. Right. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham took the church and gave it to brother Neville. &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham was free to do the work &gt;&gt; of an evangelist. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; If I rub you the wrong way, be my guest. &gt;&gt; Because some of you are quiet. If I rub you the wrong way, I'm going to rob you again. This gospel IS WITHOUT MONEY, WITHOUT PRICE. WE ARE NOT PENTECOSTAL. &gt;&gt; WE ARE NOT COPING AFTER PENTECOSTAL. &gt;&gt; An idea might be good, &gt;&gt; but be careful trying to do God a service &gt;&gt; without being in his way. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Always filter by the word. Jehoshaphat got in trouble &gt;&gt; trying to help a brother &gt;&gt; and the brother was already off the word &gt;&gt; and Jehoshaphat Jehoshaphat almost lost his life &gt;&gt; AND THE PROPHET REBUKE HIM FOR that &gt;&gt; I'm going to show support &gt;&gt; support with your support you're going to Support the devil. &gt;&gt; Young sister, support. Support support. You going to support the devil. &gt;&gt; When they call you somewhere, what are you trying to do? What does the prophet say? &gt;&gt; Please, my brother, I respect you. But to me, &gt;&gt; because God will ask you individually &gt;&gt; according to the knowledge you have. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; If you're happy and you know it, clap your hands. So, a lot of respect for the brothers. Amen. &gt;&gt; If you need our material, come here. We'll give you the material. There are material we can't put on YouTube because of the way we handle stuff. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There was nothing wrong, but we were planning like doctors. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, prayer service on Tuesday at 700 p.m. the building project. you continue to pray and Lord's willing we try to do it quickly. The treasurer told me he got everything ready. Next week you should have your taxes. Lord's willing uh receipt and everything. If you need a quote, you see me.

But the Holy Spirit is unfolding another level with faith. So let's deal with that. If you do good, we do and then I get deeper. &gt;&gt; The best the wisest thing you should have done is go and read the whole uh parable yourself and lock it in. So now when we moving, you know what it is. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's pray.

Lord, Father, may you come and speak to us in the power of resurrection. Bless this church visible and invisible. remove any problem from the world of darkness and speak to our soul in Jesus precious name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's go to Exodus 34 again. We're back again. We there was a special operation we had to deal last week with it and uh it is killing the devil left and right &gt;&gt; and it's doing very good. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And I even send you a quote about Christmas that whoever received the Holy Spirit sees. I gave you the quote on the group. &gt;&gt; So we will know where your Holy Ghost is. &gt;&gt; I will see you next this year. Lord's willing. If he doesn't tell, I will put my camera and see if you got the Holy Ghost or not. &gt;&gt; If you got a Santa stuff in your in your kitchen, take it out. Burn it. If you kept Christmas stuff to reuse it, go burn it. &gt;&gt; If you got a sticker of Christmas in your car, go peel it off. &gt;&gt; Go repent your car. Repent your house, your walls.

Our title this morning is our life journey through Joseph 5 garment part 93. And the team is I love you churchmen &gt;&gt; the the pound faith because it's the parable of the pound. &gt;&gt; In other words, the faith of the pound &gt;&gt; because we know what a pound mean. The pound faith and the Holy Ghost season. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the Holy Ghost season. Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Love, when you love people, it make you act a lot of stuff. So love will make you somebody come closer to you. It's love. So when the devil get closer to you, I'm nervous. It's love. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Uh Exodus 34 uh verse one, if you there, you can say amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; And the Lord said to Moses, "Do what?" &gt;&gt; You the two tables of stone. &gt;&gt; You may be seated like to the first, and I will write upon this table the word that were in the first table which you broke. We clear? &gt;&gt; I pray we can get into this today if the Lord allow. Amen. &gt;&gt; Remember this is not the first table. &gt;&gt; We clear on this one. &gt;&gt; When you quiet, give me Remember this is not the first table. &gt;&gt; Let's read it over. &gt;&gt; You would have saved yourself time. And the Lord said to Moses, you you two table of stone like to the water. &gt;&gt; So this is not the first table. &gt;&gt; This is the second table. The first table &gt;&gt; written by God, shopped by God, everything designed by God and just handed to Moses. &gt;&gt; But the second table of of of law was not made by God. &gt;&gt; It took a prophet hand to chop the rock &gt;&gt; to you the rock &gt;&gt; with a sharp instrument. &gt;&gt; The vision of Junior Jackson. And that rock have to be without any word on it. &gt;&gt; And he take the rock to the mountain. &gt;&gt; And God have to interpret the thunder &gt;&gt; by riding the stone upon the stone the interpretation of the thunders. Are we clear? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Verse two. And be ready in the morning and come up in the mo in the morning to the what? &gt;&gt; Mount Si &gt;&gt; to Mount Si. Mount Sana is called also Mount Horeb. Both of them are the same. We already went through this. So when you see Horeb Sana, it's the same thing. If you go to the book of Deuteronomy, it will say Horeb. If you go to Exodus, it says Sana. It's the same thing. Amen. &gt;&gt; And come to Mont Sana and present yourself there to me where &gt;&gt; in the top of the mountain. &gt;&gt; Job 2 verse uh five. And the Lord descended how? &gt;&gt; In the cloud. &gt;&gt; So when you see the cloud, you know who's coming there. Amen. &gt;&gt; It is the Lord descending. &gt;&gt; The descending of the Lord comes with a cloud. &gt;&gt; The Lord descend shall descend himself &gt;&gt; with a cloud. &gt;&gt; Are we together? Amen. &gt;&gt; So when we see a cloud, it was God that came down. &gt;&gt; It was the coming of the Lord. &gt;&gt; We already went through this. And the Lord descended in the how &gt;&gt; cloud &gt;&gt; and stood with him there. So the Lord was standing. Revelation 10 right there. Amen. &gt;&gt; And proclaim the name of what? &gt;&gt; The Lord. &gt;&gt; Are we clear so far? &gt;&gt; We clear so far. &gt;&gt; Job to verse 28. &gt;&gt; And he was there with the Lord how many days? &gt;&gt; 40 days. &gt;&gt; And what? &gt;&gt; 40 nights. And he did neither eat bread nor drink water. And he wrote upon the table the words of the covenant, the ten commandment. And it came to pass when Moses came down from Mount Sana with the two table of the testimony in Moses hand that he came down from the mount that Moses knew not that the skin of his face. This is the problem. &gt;&gt; Amen. The face. And you will see how that face goes into the parable. The skin of his face of his face shone while he talk with water. &gt;&gt; So God transfer some energy &gt;&gt; from him into Moses &gt;&gt; and Moses now begin to reflect the divine energy of God. &gt;&gt; In other words, Moses was in the presence of the Lord like a solar panel. Have I said something wrong? &gt;&gt; He was absorbing the energy &gt;&gt; and when it's night, HE CAN PUT THE ENERGY BACK AGAIN. &gt;&gt; So the prophet became the light. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; And notice this never happened with the first commandment. The face of Moses never shone &gt;&gt; when he WENT TO PICK UP THE FIRST COMMANDMENT. &gt;&gt; When he WENT TO PICK UP THE FIRST COMMANDMENT, God himself made the table &gt;&gt; and wrote upon the table what God was speaking. In other words, THE THUNDERS OF God were written on the stone &gt;&gt; and he gave it to Moses and Moses face never shone. But when Moses CUT &gt;&gt; the stone &gt;&gt; and took the unwritten stone &gt;&gt; back to the mountain, &gt;&gt; WHEN GOD INTERPRET THE WRITTEN STONE, the face of Moses begin to shine. &gt;&gt; I did this to help you to save some time. In the book of Deuteronomy chapter 9:E8 the Bible say also in what &gt;&gt; forever &gt;&gt; which is called also what &gt;&gt; s &gt;&gt; ye provoked the Lord to wrath &gt;&gt; so that the Lord was angry with you to have done what &gt;&gt; destroyed you &gt;&gt; when I was gone up in the mountain to receive what &gt;&gt; the tables of stone &gt;&gt; even the table of the commandment which the Lord made with you then I abode in the mount how many days &gt;&gt; 40 days &gt;&gt; and what how many nights &gt;&gt; 40 nights The same thing he did the second night. Amen. He said the a second time and neither did eat bread nor drink water. &gt;&gt; Water &gt;&gt; and the Lord delivered. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You remember the delivery? &gt;&gt; The faith that was once. &gt;&gt; And the Lord delivered unto me the unto me two tables of stone written with what? &gt;&gt; The finger of God. And on them were written according to all the word which the Lord spake with you in the water &gt;&gt; mount &gt;&gt; out of the midst of what &gt;&gt; the fire &gt;&gt; in the day of what &gt;&gt; the assembly. &gt;&gt; So what the people was he were were hearing as a thunder. &gt;&gt; It was actually the voice of God &gt;&gt; and the voice of God was put on the table. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So the laws that were on the table were the thunders interpreted. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; And if you notice on verse 8, Moses is saying that the Lord was angry with you. &gt;&gt; If you continue down, you will see that when Moses came, he destroyed them. &gt;&gt; AND NOBODY SAY THAT MOSES face was shining. &gt;&gt; Nobody says that. &gt;&gt; Are we together? Amen. &gt;&gt; WHEN MOSES CAME WITH ANGER and saw Israel with a molten calf, HE DESTROYED THE CALF. NOBODY SAW HIS FACE SHINING. &gt;&gt; Are we together? You can continue with this at home. Are we together? &gt;&gt; BUT THIS TIME IS DIFFERENT. &gt;&gt; WHEN MOSES GOES INTO THE mountain &gt;&gt; with the two table that he Moses made, not God. &gt;&gt; Are we together? HE ONLY TOOK THE TABLE SO GOD CAN PUT the writing. &gt;&gt; In other words, God interpreting the unwritten stone. &gt;&gt; AT THAT TIME, THE FACE OF Moses &gt;&gt; begin to shine. &gt;&gt; We clear so far. &gt;&gt; So the shining of a face &gt;&gt; goes with the interpretation of the thunders &gt;&gt; in a stone that is not written. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; We clear so far. &gt;&gt; We clear so far. Some of you are lost. We clear. &gt;&gt; Ah, if we clear, no problem. Job to verse uh 30. And when Aaron and the ch and all the children of Israel saw Moses, behold the skin of his face did water &gt;&gt; shown. &gt;&gt; If you notice, it's nobody mention about the skin of his hand. &gt;&gt; No sir. In other words, the body of Moses is not really into this. &gt;&gt; It's only the head. &gt;&gt; Take your time. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; What is shining is the head. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. AMEN. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; Come on now, brother. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Take your time, brother. &gt;&gt; What shine is the &gt;&gt; head, &gt;&gt; the face, &gt;&gt; not the member, &gt;&gt; not the body, &gt;&gt; it's still the body of Moses, &gt;&gt; but the shining is in the head. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The head stone. &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? the husband, &gt;&gt; the head, &gt;&gt; not the body, not the brother. &gt;&gt; Because a prophet is a son, &gt;&gt; not the bride, the husband, the head. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; The head of the church &gt;&gt; is the one shining. &gt;&gt; Not the body. The head. &gt;&gt; The head of the church. &gt;&gt; The head of the church. &gt;&gt; The head of the church. &gt;&gt; The head of the church. The head is shining. &gt;&gt; And when the head is shining, it means the interpretation of the thunders. &gt;&gt; We clear now. &gt;&gt; We clear now. AND BEFORE THIS HEAD HERE, brother Brandham have to cut the stone. &gt;&gt; AND WHEN BROTHER BRANDHAM CUT THE STONE, HE WENT ON THE WEST. THEN THE HEAD CAME UP &gt;&gt; AND THE HEAD CAME UP SHINING TO TELL YOU THAT IT'S TIME FOR THE THUNDERS TO BE INTERPRETED. &gt;&gt; And they're NOT GOING TO BE INTERPRETED BY GOD BUT THROUGH A MAJOR PROPHET. &gt;&gt; A PROPHET LIKE UNTO MOSES &gt;&gt; THAT HAVE THE SON IN THE HAND. &gt;&gt; YES SIR. Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; We clear now. &gt;&gt; We clear now. &gt;&gt; God. &gt;&gt; Job to verse uh 33. &gt;&gt; And until Moses, Till Moses has done what? &gt;&gt; Speaking with him. &gt;&gt; He did what? &gt;&gt; He put a veil on his face. &gt;&gt; Uh-huh. Continue, my friend. &gt;&gt; But when Moses went in before the Lord &gt;&gt; to speak with him, &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. He took the veil off &gt;&gt; because he need to hook the charger. &gt;&gt; He need to expose the panel &gt;&gt; to the sun &gt;&gt; to begin to absorb. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he took the veil off until he did what? &gt;&gt; Came out &gt;&gt; and he come out and spoke to the children of Israel that which he was water &gt;&gt; commanded. &gt;&gt; So what Moses was absorbing was not just the energy. &gt;&gt; No sir. He was absorbing the word &gt;&gt; and when the word got into Moses, Moses was velling the word &gt;&gt; and the word begin to shine on his face. &gt;&gt; Exactly. Right. &gt;&gt; So he have to come back and deliver the word &gt;&gt; sir. Use the energy &gt;&gt; to supply at the body. &gt;&gt; So the body can come with your &gt;&gt; with your charger. &gt;&gt; We hook it in spoken word. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; So we can hook it in our home. &gt;&gt; That's why we NEED TO LISTEN TO THE MESSAGE. THAT'S WHY WE NEED TO read the message. &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY YOU NEED TO LET THE MESSAGE play in your home &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THERE IS POWER OF CHARGING YOUR HOME. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; It's a battery charging you. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? Amen. &gt;&gt; The Bible says verse 35, "And the children of Israel saw the face of Moses that the skin of Moses' face did what?" &gt;&gt; And Moses put the veil upon his face again until he went to speak with what? &gt;&gt; So Moses never veil his body because he was shining because his body was already having clothing but nothing in his body was shining. But he have to veil his skin. Right. &gt;&gt; He had to took I mean uh he have to take a veil &gt;&gt; and put it around his head &gt;&gt; clear so far. &gt;&gt; We clear so far? &gt;&gt; Everybody clear? Let's go to Luke 19. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. Glory. Glory. H since we lay we there. I'm just singing waiting on you. &gt;&gt; If you there you can say amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Luke 19. Let's go to verse 11. Now follow me carefully. I'm going to touch up so we move on. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Verse 11. The Bible says, you know this, in the house of Zakius, the rich man, he says, "And as they heard these things, what he spoke about Zakius, he added and spoke a what?" &gt;&gt; Parable. &gt;&gt; So God added something new. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He came up with something else different &gt;&gt; that he was saying. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because he was near what? &gt;&gt; Jerusalem. And because they thought that the kingdom of God should what? &gt;&gt; Immediately appear. &gt;&gt; He said, "Therefore, a certain noble man went into a far country to receive for himself a water &gt;&gt; a kingdom." &gt;&gt; SO THERE IS TWO COUNTRIES HERE. &gt;&gt; There is a country where the noble man is actually there. &gt;&gt; Amen. And there is another country that they call what? &gt;&gt; A far country. &gt;&gt; And we know what it means. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham already interpreted. &gt;&gt; Far country means what? &gt;&gt; Heaven. &gt;&gt; And the country that he was in was what? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; So we got two country. But he is right here. &gt;&gt; The man, the noble man is right there. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. The Bible says, "And a certain noble man went into a far country to receive for himself a kingdom." He went to be transformed there. &gt;&gt; When he's coming back there, he's not coming back the same way he left. &gt;&gt; When he's coming back from there, he's coming with a kingdom. &gt;&gt; We clear to for your information. You already know THE NOBLE MAN IS JESUS. AMEN. &gt;&gt; He was the king of the Jews, &gt;&gt; but he was never recognized as the king. &gt;&gt; But he WENT TO HEAVEN &gt;&gt; SO THAT WHEN HE'S RETURNING from heaven, HE'S RETURNING AS A KING OF KINGS. &gt;&gt; As the lord of lord &gt;&gt; in the book of revelation 19. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Clear. Verse 13. And he called his 10 servant and delivered them what? &gt;&gt; 10 pounds. &gt;&gt; And say unto them, do what? &gt;&gt; Occupy till I come. &gt;&gt; If you notice, he didn't deliver that pound in heaven. &gt;&gt; No sir. &gt;&gt; No sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We already studying, but now you slow. &gt;&gt; He's giving the pound right here. &gt;&gt; WE KNOW THAT THAT POUND MEANS MONEY. It's in your Bible. I already gave you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Pound &gt;&gt; means what? &gt;&gt; And money means what? &gt;&gt; Purchase power means what? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So the pound represent what? &gt;&gt; We clear. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We clear. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The Bible says that he called how many servant? &gt;&gt; 10 servants. He called 10 servants. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he delivered them how many pound? &gt;&gt; 10 pound. &gt;&gt; 10 pound. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So each servant received how much? &gt;&gt; One pound. &gt;&gt; 10 divided by 10 equal what? &gt;&gt; One. &gt;&gt; We clear so far? &gt;&gt; The 10 pound was all in him. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? BUT BEFORE HE DEPART TO THE FAR AWAY COUNTRY, &gt;&gt; HE DISCLOSED HOW MUCH MONEY HE HAD ON EARTH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; When he disclosed the money, we realized that he had£10. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; HE WAS ONE PERSON WITH£10. &gt;&gt; Are we together? BUT WHEN HE WANT TO GIVE THE children the servant, &gt;&gt; HE COULD NOT GIVE £10 TO ONE. &gt;&gt; He had to divide. &gt;&gt; Put your seat belt my friend. &gt;&gt; HE HAD TO DIVIDE THE£10 SO THAT EVERYBODY RECEIVE A PORTION. &gt;&gt; I hope we together. &gt;&gt; I hope WE TOGETHER. &gt;&gt; AMEN. SO NOW WHEN EVERYBODY receive a portion, YOU DON'T HAVE HIM ANYMORE. &gt;&gt; IF TWO OF YOU GATHER TOGETHER, YOU ONLY HAVE 210 &gt;&gt; FOR YOU TO MAKE UP HIM. &gt;&gt; ALL OF YOU NEED TO COME TOGETHER. &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? ALL OF YOU DID NOT NEED TO COME TOGETHER TO MAKE UP ONE PERSON. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE ON THE DAY OF PENTECOST, HE CAME DOWN. &gt;&gt; AND WHEN HE CAME, HE DIVIDED HIMSELF. &gt;&gt; YES, he did. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; AND A PORTION BEGIN TO GET EACH ONE. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; We clear so far. &gt;&gt; We clear so far. Yes. &gt;&gt; The point WAS WHY IS THIS parable coming? &gt;&gt; THE PARABLE IS COMING BASED ON THE EXPECTATION. &gt;&gt; The expectation of the Jews. They say Jesus is coming. &gt;&gt; He's going to take the Roman out and he's going to take over and restore the kingdom back to Israel. And Jesus EXPLAINED TO THEM THEY DIDN'T GET IT. SO WHEN JESUS resurrected and HE BEGIN TO CROSS WALLS &gt;&gt; AND HE SAY ALL POWER IN HEAVEN AND EARTH IS GIVEN TO ME. &gt;&gt; THE DISCIPLE LOOK THEY SAY AH NOW HE CAN APPEAR AND DISAPPEAR. &gt;&gt; SO WE GOT THE PERFECT TOOL. &gt;&gt; ALL HE HAS TO DO IS APPEAR BEHIND THE ROMAN SOLDIER. CHOP HIM, KILL HIM, AND HE DISAPPEARED AND GO TO THE NEXT ROMAN SOLDIER. KILL HIM AND HE DISAPPEARED. NOW HE'S GOING TO FINISH ALL ROME. &gt;&gt; SO THEY SAY THIS IS NOW THE PERFECT TIME. &gt;&gt; GOD IS GOING TO RESTORE THE KINGDOM. &gt;&gt; Follow me my friend. &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? &gt;&gt; THEN JESUS HAS TO MANAGE THEIR EXPECTATION. JESUS HAVE TO CORRECT THEIR EXPECTATION &gt;&gt; ACCORDING TO THE PLAN OF REDEMPTION. &gt;&gt; IN OTHER WORDS, JESUS HAS TO TELL THEM YOU ARE LOOKING AT THAT WRONG. &gt;&gt; THERE IS STILL ANOTHER SEASON. &gt;&gt; THERE IS STILL YET ANOTHER SEASON BEFORE THE KINGDOM WILL BE IS RESTORED. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HE WAS MANAGING THEIR EXPECTATION. TAKE YOUR TIME. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; In my name. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; In plan word, we trying to build a house. &gt;&gt; And everybody's saying, "Oh, so we will see the house coming up." &gt;&gt; And brother Robert come saym, "That's not the way you work." &gt;&gt; The way you work, we got to dig the foundation first. &gt;&gt; Take your time. &gt;&gt; So you need to open up your mind to the digging of the foundation &gt;&gt; because if not, you going to miss the season. The season now is not to erect the wall, &gt;&gt; but it's the season of the foundation. &gt;&gt; So Jesus WAS TELLING THEM THIS IS NOT THE SEASON I need to rain. &gt;&gt; This is THERE IS ANOTHER SEASON BEFORE THAT. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Now brother Brham says this. Glory to God. Brother Brham says, Brother Brham says this. Before we get there, let me go back here in THE BOOK OF ACTS chapter 1 verse 6. The Bible say when he when they therefore were come how &gt;&gt; together &gt;&gt; they asked him the disciple he's disappearing and appearing SAYING LORD WILL DIE AT THIS TIME. &gt;&gt; IN OTHER WORDS AH NOW THAT YOU SAY ALL POWER &gt;&gt; POWER &gt;&gt; IN HEAVEN and earth is given to you. &gt;&gt; NOW YOU OVERCOME HELL AND THE GRAVE. &gt;&gt; NOW YOU CAN APPEAR AND DISAPPEAR. &gt;&gt; NOW EVEN IF WE SHUT THE DOOR YOU COME INSIDE. YOU SAY ALL IS WELL. &gt;&gt; Now we see you in a different level. &gt;&gt; So the ANOINTING IS FLYING DIFFERENTLY NOW. &gt;&gt; SO IS THIS THE time &gt;&gt; that YOU GOING TO TAKE THE KINGDOM &gt;&gt; AND RESTORE IT BACK TO ISRAEL? &gt;&gt; THIS KINGDOM THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT WAS A NATURAL KINGDOM. &gt;&gt; Follow me my friend. &gt;&gt; IT WAS A NATURAL KINGDOM. THEY WANT HIM TO BE A KING NATURALLY. &gt;&gt; That's exactly. &gt;&gt; Don't worry. Until some of you will be filled with the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; As I'm moving this way, you will catch up yourself. You are filled with the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Don't worry. The Holy Ghost will ambush you. &gt;&gt; As you following, you will find yourself as the as Peter yet spake the word. &gt;&gt; You will find the Holy Ghost in you. So stay focused. &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? &gt;&gt; HE SAID, "LORD, WILL thou at this time restore again the water &gt;&gt; the kingdom TO ISRAEL." &gt;&gt; AND HE SAY UNTO THEM, "IT IS NOT FOR YOU &gt;&gt; TO KNOW THE WATER, &gt;&gt; the time, &gt;&gt; all water, &gt;&gt; OR THE SEASON." &gt;&gt; SO THE SEVEN SEAL IS LOCKED RIGHT HERE. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; THE TIME AND THE SEASON WHICH THE FATHER HAS PUT IN WATER, &gt;&gt; HIS OWN POWER. IN OTHER WORD, YOU ARE CARING ABOUT SOMETHING THAT IS NOT IMPORTANT FOR YOU. Now &gt;&gt; I hope you are you are understanding me. &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? IN OTHER WORDS, JESUS IS TELLING THEM WHAT YOU ASKING ME NOW. YOU SHOULD NOT BE WORRYING ABOUT IT. &gt;&gt; THESE ARE THINGS THAT THE FATHER HIMSELF HAVE. &gt;&gt; BUT THE BUT HE'S CHANGING. RIGHT. &gt;&gt; IN OTHER WORDS, THIS IS WHAT YOU NEED TO BE AWARE OF, &gt;&gt; NOT WHAT YOU ASKING ME, &gt;&gt; SIR. &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. &gt;&gt; He says, HE SAYS, "BUT &gt;&gt; YE SHALL RECEIVE WHAT &gt;&gt; POWER &gt;&gt; after what &gt;&gt; that the Holy Ghost has come upon you." &gt;&gt; In other word, &gt;&gt; WHAT YOU ASKING FOR IS NOT IMPORTANT FOR YOU NOW. THERE IS ANOTHER SEASON THAT IS ABOUT TO START. &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. &gt;&gt; AND THAT SEASON IS THE HOLY GHOST IS COMING. &gt;&gt; SO FORGET ABOUT THE NATURAL KINGDOM. &gt;&gt; I'M I AM RESTORING A SPIRITUAL KINGDOM. LORD HAVE YOU glory glory glory glory glory FIRST &gt;&gt; DON'T WORRY we will catch up MY FRIEND &gt;&gt; STAY T STOP MOVING around let's move on are we together &gt;&gt; let's go again somebody didn't get it I'm going to push it until we go amen I won't let you lagging behind &gt;&gt; we got to move together &gt;&gt; are we together &gt;&gt; the disciple are coming and they're saying Lord So we let this time that you're going to restore the kingdom. &gt;&gt; He say you are worrying about something that you should not be worrying now. &gt;&gt; What you need to worry about is this. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In other words, this is what is going to take place first. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Leave the other one alone. &gt;&gt; And notice all of them die. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; And no one have seen the kingdom restored yet. All the disciple are already dead. SO THEY WERE TRYING TO GAIN INFORMATION of something they would not be there. &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. SO JESUS IS TELLING THEM YOU'RE GOING TO MISS YOUR SEASON. &gt;&gt; WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN NOW IS THE HOLY GHOST IS COMING. &gt;&gt; Follow me. &gt;&gt; AND WHEN THE HOLY GHOST COME, &gt;&gt; are we together? YOU WILL RECEIVE POWER. &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHAT WE SAY, BROTHER. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; That's what we say. &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? IN OTHER WORDS, QUIT FOCUSING ABOUT THE NATURAL KINGDOM. &gt;&gt; I AM NOT RESTORING THE NATURAL KINGDOM. &gt;&gt; I AM RESTORING THE SPIRITUAL KINGDOM. &gt;&gt; SO, YOU NEED TO REFOCUS YOUR MIND. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. AND BEGIN TO WATCH &gt;&gt; FOR THE RESTORATION OF A SPIRITUAL KINGDOM BECAUSE THE SPIRITUAL KINGDOM MUST BE RESTORED FIRST BEFORE THE NATURAL KINGDOM. GOD MUST RESTORE YOUR SOUL FIRST &gt;&gt; BEFORE HE CHANGES YOUR BODY. &gt;&gt; I HOPE WE ARE TOGETHER. &gt;&gt; YOU WON'T RECEIVE THE BODY CHANGE IF YOU DIDN'T HAVE THE SOUL CHANGE. THE SPIRITUAL MUST TAKE PLACE FIRST THEN THE NATURAL WILL COME FURTHER. &gt;&gt; WE MUST UNITE YOU IN THE CHURCH FIRST &gt;&gt; BEFORE YOU GET UNITED IN YOUR BODY WITH YOUR HUSBAND. &gt;&gt; THE SPIRITUAL ALWAYS GOES FIRST THEN THE NATURAL WILL FOLLOW. &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? IF WE TOGETHER SAY AMEN. &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? &gt;&gt; LISTEN TO BROTHER BRHAM. HALLELUJAH. LISTEN TO BROTHER BRANDHAM. &gt;&gt; BROTHER BRHAM say in a message uh question and answer. He say he was what? &gt;&gt; Crucified. &gt;&gt; And he did what? &gt;&gt; Died. &gt;&gt; And what? &gt;&gt; Rose the third day. &gt;&gt; Uh and was on EARTH HOW MANY DAYS? &gt;&gt; 40 DAYS among men. &gt;&gt; Remember 40 days. Amen. And he did what? &gt;&gt; Ascended up into heaven. &gt;&gt; AND TAUGHT THEM TO DO WHAT? &gt;&gt; Wait till they seen the kingdom of God. &gt;&gt; Wait until they see the kingdom of God come. How? &gt;&gt; Upon them. At this time THE FATHER WILL RESTORE THE KINGDOM. HOW? &gt;&gt; IN A spiritual form to them. &gt;&gt; IN A SPIRITUAL FORM TO THEM. &gt;&gt; THEY WENT UP TO THE CITY OF WATER. &gt;&gt; JERUSALEM. &gt;&gt; And did water &gt;&gt; waited there &gt;&gt; for how many days? &gt;&gt; 10 DAYS. &gt;&gt; SO THEY HAVE TO WAIT FOR 10 DAYS BECAUSE THE HOLY GHOST CAME ON THE DAY OF PENTECOST. &gt;&gt; PENTECOST MEANS 50. &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? JESUS ALREADY SPENT WITH THEM 40 DAYS. &gt;&gt; SO 50 MINUS 40. &gt;&gt; IT'S HOW MANY DAYS? &gt;&gt; AND HOW MANY POUND DID HE LEFT? &gt;&gt; Are we together? Are we together? I'M USING A B2 BOMBER, MY FRIEND. HOW MANY POUND DID HE LEFT? &gt;&gt; HOW MANY DAYS DO THEY HAVE TO WAIT FOR THE HOLY GHOST? WOW. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; ARE WE COMING? &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; OKAY. BROTHER SAY FOR 10 DAYS AND WHAT? &gt;&gt; AND WHAT? &gt;&gt; ALL OF A SUDDEN &gt;&gt; THE WHAT? &gt;&gt; THE BAPTISM OF THE HOLY SPIRIT. &gt;&gt; THE KINGDOM OF GOD. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; THE BAPTISM OF THE HOLY GHOST IS WHAT? &gt;&gt; THE KINGDOM OF GOD. &gt;&gt; THE KINGDOM OF GOD COME WITH WHAT? &gt;&gt; POWER UPON THEM. &gt;&gt; IS THAT RIGHT? &gt;&gt; AMEN. IN THE EXPOSITION OF THE CHURCH AGES, HE SAY YOU REMEMBER THAT THEY CAME TO JESUS IN THE BOOK OF ACT and did what? &gt;&gt; Ask him &gt;&gt; continue my friend. &gt;&gt; Are you at this time going to restore the kingdom to Israel &gt;&gt; and he says what &gt;&gt; it is not for you to know the TIMES OR THE SEASON. &gt;&gt; THOSE MEN WERE STILL THINKING &gt;&gt; OF JESUS HAVING AN EARTHLY KINGDOM &gt;&gt; BUT HE WAS A WHAT? &gt;&gt; A SPIRITUAL KINGDOM &gt;&gt; THAT HE WAS GOING TO DO AS &gt;&gt; BUILD. &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? SO JESUS IS TELLING THEM QUIT WORRYING ABOUT THIS. &gt;&gt; ANOTHER SEASON HAVE OPENED UP. &gt;&gt; IT'S A SEASON OF THE DISPENSATION OF THE HOLY GHOST. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; AND WHEN THE HOLY GHOST COME UPON YOU, YOU WILL RECEIVE WHAT? &gt;&gt; POWER. &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AND WHEN YOU RECEIVE POWER, YOU WILL BE WHAT? &gt;&gt; WITNESSES. YOU WILL RECEIVE power when &gt;&gt; after the Holy Ghost has come upon you. &gt;&gt; Not before, &gt;&gt; AFTER THE HOLY GHOST IS GIVEN UNTO YOU, YOU WILL RECEIVE WHAT? &gt;&gt; POWER. &gt;&gt; SO YOU CANNOT RECEIVE THE HOLY GHOST AND YOUR HOLY GHOST DOESN'T HAVE POWER. &gt;&gt; I HOPE WE ARE TOGETHER. WE ARE CLEANING UP MESSAGE BELIEVER. &gt;&gt; THE HOLY GHOST. MY HOLY GHOST. UHHUH. THE HOLY GHOST GOT POWER. &gt;&gt; IT'S a powerful spirit. &gt;&gt; IT'S A SPIRIT AND A FIRE. &gt;&gt; I HOPE WE ARE TOGETHER. &gt;&gt; I HOPE WE ARE TOGETHER. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; YOU SHALL RECEIVE POWER WHEN &gt;&gt; WHEN THE HOLY Ghost has come upon YOU &gt;&gt; AND YE SHALL BE WHAT? &gt;&gt; WITNESSES. YOU CANNOT BE A WITNESS IF YOU DON'T HAVE THE HOLY GHOST. &gt;&gt; MANY YOUNG MEN IN THIS MESSAGE WENT THROUGH A WRECK &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THEY TRIED TO PREACH THE GOSPEL WITHOUT THE HOLY GHOST. &gt;&gt; OH, WE GOING TO TESTIFY. WE GOING TO TESTIFY. AND A YOUNG MAN IN A BUNCH OF WORLDLY WOMEN, &gt;&gt; BEFORE YOU KNOW IT, HE'S ON TOTAL LOSS. BECAUSE BEFORE YOU TESTIFY, BEFORE YOU WITNESS, YOU MUST HAVE THE POWER. &gt;&gt; THE POWER THAT HELP YOU GET IN OUR RAIN. &gt;&gt; DROP THE BOMB AND YOU COME BACK SAFE HOME. LORD, &gt;&gt; YOU CAN GO INTO THE ENEMY CAMP AND DROP THE BUNKER BOMB AND YOU CAN COME BACK AND RETRIEVE BACK AND YOU ARE SAFE BECAUSE YOU ARE ALL BLESSING &gt;&gt; WITH THE FIRE OF THE HOLY GHOST. ARE WE TOGETHER? &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; HE SAID, "YOU SHALL BE WITNESS WHERE?" &gt;&gt; UNTO me &gt;&gt; where? &gt;&gt; Both in Jerusalem. &gt;&gt; In Jerusalem &gt;&gt; and what? &gt;&gt; And in all Judea. &gt;&gt; In Judea. Jews. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And what? &gt;&gt; And in Samaria. &gt;&gt; Samaria. &gt;&gt; Samaritan. Is my Bible different? &gt;&gt; And then what? &gt;&gt; And unto the uttermost part of the earth. &gt;&gt; GENTILES. &gt;&gt; OUT THE MOST IS WHO? &gt;&gt; GENTILES. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; SO THE GOSPEL MUST BE PREACHED TO WHO? &gt;&gt; JEWS, SAMARITAN, &gt;&gt; GENTILE. &gt;&gt; IN OTHER WORD, YOU ARE YOU NEED TO GET IN THE SEASON. THE SEASON IS THE HOLY GHOST WILL COME AND THE GOSPEL MUST GO EVERYWHERE &gt;&gt; BEFORE THE RESTORATION. THE GOSPEL MUST BE PREACHED TO THE JEWS, &gt;&gt; TO THE GENTILE, AND THEN TO THE SAMARITAN. IF NOT, I WON'T RESTORE THE KINGDOM. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE I MUST RESTORE THE KINGDOM IN EVERY LEVEL &gt;&gt; BECAUSE I GOT CHILDREN THAT ARE JEWS. &gt;&gt; I GOT CHILDREN THAT ARE SAMARITAN. BUT I ALSO GOT CHILDREN IN GASTONIA, NORTH CAROLINA THAT ARE GENTILE AND I CANNOT RESTORE THE KINGDOM IF THOSE CHILDREN ARE NOT RESTORED BACK. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Jesus will not come back to be king. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. If you are not restored, &gt;&gt; you the ONE THAT IS BLOCKING THE RESTORATION OF ISRAEL. &gt;&gt; THE SEVEN SEAL IS BLOCKED HERE &gt;&gt; BEFORE HE GOES TO THE JEWS. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; THE JEWS WON'T BE BORN AGAIN UNTIL WE CHANGE. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; The three category was given there. Amen. &gt;&gt; And the Bible says that when he when he has spoken this thing, he did what? &gt;&gt; While they beheld, &gt;&gt; he was water. &gt;&gt; He was taken up. &gt;&gt; How? &gt;&gt; And a cloud received. &gt;&gt; So when he's coming, he's coming. How? &gt;&gt; He was taken up. How? &gt;&gt; WOW. HE'S COMING. HE'S COMING with what? &gt;&gt; I hope WE TOGETHER. IN OTHER WORD, WHEN HE FINISHED, HE TOOK THE JOURNEY. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; HE GOT IN THE AIRPLANE AND THE AIRPLANE CLOSED. &gt;&gt; SEE YOU LATER ON. &gt;&gt; BUT REMEMBER, THE HOLY GHOST IS COMING. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; We clear. &gt;&gt; We clear. THE BIBLE SAYS IN THE BOOK OF MATTHEW THAT AND THIS GOSPEL OF THE KINGDOM SHALL BE how &gt;&gt; preached &gt;&gt; where &gt;&gt; in all THE WORLD &gt;&gt; FOR A WHAT? &gt;&gt; A witness &gt;&gt; unto what? &gt;&gt; ALL NATIONS. &gt;&gt; AND THEN SHALL THE END &gt;&gt; COME. &gt;&gt; THE END CANNOT COME &gt;&gt; IF THE GOSPEL IS NOT GOING TO EVERY NATION. &gt;&gt; Are we together? YEAH. &gt;&gt; SO REMEMBER NOW THE £10, HE DIDN'T have that in heaven. &gt;&gt; He has that water. &gt;&gt; He had it TO HIMSELF. &gt;&gt; BUT BEFORE HE DEPARTED, &gt;&gt; HE TOOK THE MONEY HE HAS. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; AND HE PASSED TO THE SERVANT. &gt;&gt; He gave it TO THE SERVANT. &gt;&gt; HE NEVER GAVE THEM UNTIL HE WAS GETTING READY TO GO. SO HE WAS CHANGING MINISTRY. &gt;&gt; I HOPE WE ARE TOGETHER. &gt;&gt; I HOPE WE ARE TOGETHER BECAUSE MONEY REPRESENT WHAT &gt;&gt; AND HE CAME WITH FAITH &gt;&gt; AND HE WAS THE FAITH. &gt;&gt; Are we together &gt;&gt; my friend? LET'S PAY ATTENTION. &gt;&gt; THE BIBLE SAY IN GALATIAN BUT BEFORE WHAT &gt;&gt; FAITH CAME. COME ON. &gt;&gt; SO FAITH WAS NOT THERE. &gt;&gt; THAT FAITH IS NOT JUST THE FAITH YOU THINKING OF. &gt;&gt; IT'S THE FAITH OF A PERSON. &gt;&gt; BEFORE FAITH CAME, WE WERE HOW &gt;&gt; KEPT UNDER THE LAW. &gt;&gt; SO WE WERE UNDER THE LAW UNTIL JESUS CAME. &gt;&gt; IT IS JESUS THAT BROUGHT FAITH. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; And when HE WHEN HE UNVEILED THE FAITH HE HAD, &gt;&gt; THE FAITH IS 10 POUND. AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; IT'S A 10B FAITH. &gt;&gt; 10B FAITH. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; AND BROTHER, BROTHER, I'M SAYING THE MESSAGE, THE COUNTDOWN.

Some of you DIDN'T GET IT. HE HE GAVE YOU THE FAITH TO OVERCOME THE CORNER NATURE. &gt;&gt; MY FRIEND, I TOLD YOU, IF YOU STAY FOCUSED, THE HOLY GHOST WILL FILL YOU. &gt;&gt; IF YOU STAY FOCUSED, I'M NOT PLAYING GAMES. THE HOLY SPIRIT WILL FILL YOU. I KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. HE GAVE US THE FAITH THAT WILL CONQUER THE CARNAL NATURE BECAUSE OUR ENEMY IS THE CARER NATURE. &gt;&gt; SO HE GAVE US THE FAITH THAT WILL TAKE CARE OF YOUR COUNTER PROBLEM. &gt;&gt; IN OTHER WORDS, THERE IS NOTHING YOU CAN STRUGGLE WITH THAT DOESN'T HAVE ENOUGH SWEAT THROUGH THE FAITH.

BROTHER BRHAM SAY HE SAYS SO IT IS NOT JUST A WHAT &gt;&gt; A RITUALISTIC AFFAIR &gt;&gt; BUT IT'S ABSOLUTELY what &gt;&gt; a real &gt;&gt; what &gt;&gt; living reality &gt;&gt; of what &gt;&gt; the resurrection of Jesus Christ &gt;&gt; where &gt;&gt; LIVING AMONG MEN &gt;&gt; AND THAT IS THE FAITH &gt;&gt; THAT I'M TRYING &gt;&gt; MY BEST &gt;&gt; TO DO WHAT &gt;&gt; CONTENT FOR TODAY &gt;&gt; THAT JESUS CHRIST IS WHAT &gt;&gt; THE SAME YESTERDAY TODAY AND FOREVER &gt;&gt; AND HIS POWER IS WHAT &gt;&gt; UNLIMITED YOUR FAITH is how? &gt;&gt; Unlimited. &gt;&gt; Say it. Say it. &gt;&gt; YOUR FAITH IS HOW? &gt;&gt; UNLIMITED. &gt;&gt; SAY IT. SO THE DEVIL HEARS IT. &gt;&gt; UNLIMITED. &gt;&gt; TELL THE DEVIL, "MY FAITH IS UNLIMITED." &gt;&gt; BECAUSE IT'S NOT MY FAITH. &gt;&gt; IT WAS DELIVERED TO ME. &gt;&gt; IT IS HIS FAITH. YOU don't understand. &gt;&gt; YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND. &gt;&gt; YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND. &gt;&gt; There is a credit card called American Express. &gt;&gt; And depending on who you are, &gt;&gt; that credit card can go unlimited. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; And he got my name on it. Uh-huh. &gt;&gt; And I take that credit card and I give to Sister Sharon. &gt;&gt; What did I give to Sister Sharon? &gt;&gt; WHAT DO YOU THINK SISTER SHARON HAS? &gt;&gt; SHE'S NOT USING HER CARD. &gt;&gt; SHE'S USING MY CARD. &gt;&gt; BUT BECAUSE MY CARD IS UNLIMITED AND SHE used my card, HER CARD BECAME ALSO UNLIMITED. WHEN SHE'S SWAPPING, SHE'S SWAPPING IN MY NAME. &gt;&gt; SHE'S SWAPPING THE CARD. &gt;&gt; IN MY NAME, YOU SHALL CAST THAT DEVIL. IN MY NAME, YOU SHALL IN MY NAME. IN JESUS NAME. SWAP THE CARD IN JESUS NAME. IN Jesus name. &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? ARE WE TOGETHER? &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? &gt;&gt; CONTINUE. THE HOLY GHOST IS COMING MY FRIEND. &gt;&gt; ARE we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; BROTHER BRANDHAM SAID THE FAITH IS FIGHTING FOR &gt;&gt; IS THAT GOD THAT FAITH IS HOW &gt;&gt; UNLIMITED. &gt;&gt; WHY IS BROTHER BRANDHAM FIGHTING FOR IT? BECAUSE THE CARNAL MIND &gt;&gt; OUR MIND &gt;&gt; THE DEVIL IS WORKING EVERYTHING &gt;&gt; TO CONVINCE YOU THAT YOU ARE LIMITED. TO TELL YOU YOU CAN ONLY GO SO FAR. &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? &gt;&gt; BROTHER BRANDHAM SAYS THIS. &gt;&gt; IF YOU CAN LIMIT WHO? &gt;&gt; GOD. &gt;&gt; You can limit who? &gt;&gt; Christ. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE CHRIST AND GOD ARE WHAT? &gt;&gt; ONE. AND IF YOU LIMIT THE CHURCH TODAY &gt;&gt; IN ITS POSSIBILITY, YOU ARE LIMITING GOD. &gt;&gt; You didn't get it. &gt;&gt; Let's read it again. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; YOU SEE, WHEN I TALK ABOUT GOD AND CHRIST, YOU WERE all saying, "Amen." Now, when it come to YOU, YOU BACK UP. THIS IS THE THING I'M FIGHTING WITH &gt;&gt; BECAUSE WE GOT TO BE CHANGED &gt;&gt; AND WE NEED A HIGHER FAITH. &gt;&gt; THE BROTHER PRANAM SAY IF YOU CAN LIMIT WHO? &gt;&gt; GOD, &gt;&gt; you can limit who? &gt;&gt; Christ. &gt;&gt; And if YOU LIMIT THE CHURCH, &gt;&gt; NOT GOD. &gt;&gt; THE CHURCH TODAY IN ITS WHAT &gt;&gt; POSSIBILITY. &gt;&gt; YOU ARE LIMITING WHO? &gt;&gt; GOD. &gt;&gt; IN OTHER WAY, YOU BEGIN TO BLOCK GOD. BECAUSE THE CHURCH IS GOD PIPE. GOD IS CHANNELING EVERYTHING THROUGH THE CHURCH. &gt;&gt; My friend, &gt;&gt; WHEN I SAY CHURCH, your mind, your corner mind is looking at spoken word. Forget spoken word. &gt;&gt; IF THEY LIMIT YOU, &gt;&gt; YOU THEY ARE LIMITING GOD. YOU ARE GOD PIPE. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU GETTING ME. &gt;&gt; I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'RE GETTING ME. &gt;&gt; Who carried the pregnancy? &gt;&gt; The man or the woman? &gt;&gt; The woman. &gt;&gt; So the man have to take his baby and put it in a woman &gt;&gt; and the woman has to express. &gt;&gt; If you block the woman, you blocking who? &gt;&gt; IF YOU BLOCK THE CHURCH, YOU BLOCKING WHO? &gt;&gt; BECAUSE GOD WANT HIS BABY TO COME THROUGH THE CHURCH. GOD WANTS THE CHURCH TO BE UNLIMITED &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THE CHURCH IS GOD. &gt;&gt; EVERYTHING THAT WAS IN GOD, HE PLE AWAY &gt;&gt; IN HIS CHURCH. &gt;&gt; AND EVERYTHING THAT WAS IN CHRIST, HE PLE AWAY. &gt;&gt; SO THE CHURCH MUST BE HOW? &gt;&gt; YES SIR. &gt;&gt; I HOPE WE ARE TOGETHER. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; I HOPE WE ARE TOGETHER. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; HE SAYS IF YOU CAN LIMIT GOD, YOU CAN LIMIT WHO? &gt;&gt; CHRIST. IF YOU CAN LIMIT THE CHURCH TODAY IN ITS POSSIBILITIES, YOU ARE LIMITING WHO? &gt;&gt; GOD. &gt;&gt; BUT ALL things &gt;&gt; whatsoever. &gt;&gt; CAN YOU READ? &gt;&gt; WHATSOEVER WHAT &gt;&gt; YOU DESIRE. &gt;&gt; WHEN YOU WHAT? &gt;&gt; PRAY &gt;&gt; BELIEVE YOU RECEIVE IT AND YOU SHALL DO WHAT? &gt;&gt; HAVE IT. &gt;&gt; HE SAID THAT. &gt;&gt; I BELIEVE IT AND I KNOW IT IS WHAT? &gt;&gt; THE TRUTH. I TOLD YOU I'M TAKING FAITH TO ANOTHER LEVEL. &gt;&gt; WHY did he LEAVE THE CHURCH? &gt;&gt; FAITH IS EVERYTHING. &gt;&gt; FAITH ANSWER FOR EVERYTHING. &gt;&gt; Faith is unlimited. &gt;&gt; Not only that, my friend, &gt;&gt; let's look at this, my friend. THE BIBLE SAYS, "FOR WHATSOEVER IS WHAT? &gt;&gt; BORN OF GOD &gt;&gt; DOES WHAT? &gt;&gt; OVERCOMETH THE WORLD." &gt;&gt; AND THIS IS THE WHAT? &gt;&gt; VICTORY &gt;&gt; THAT DOES WHAT? THAT OVERCOMETH THE WORLD. &gt;&gt; WHAT IS THE VICTORY THAT OVERCOME WHAT? &gt;&gt; The world. &gt;&gt; Cosmos. &gt;&gt; The victory THAT OVERCOMETH THE WORLD IS WHAT? &gt;&gt; OUR FAITH. &gt;&gt; Our faith. &gt;&gt; So when God give you faith, &gt;&gt; HE ALREADY GAVE YOU THE VICTORY. You don't get it, my friend. &gt;&gt; You don't understand, my friend. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; If you understand what I'm telling you, we don't have to cast out devils on you. You know, brother. YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; IF YOU GOT A CIGARETTE AND FAITH COME, THE CIGARETTE WILL DROP. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; You don't get what I'M SAYING? WHO PRAYED FOR THE WOMAN AT THE WELL, &gt;&gt; WHO PRAYED FOR HER? &gt;&gt; WHAT DID JESUS DO TO HER? &gt;&gt; DISCERN. And when he discern, &gt;&gt; what did the woman do? &gt;&gt; SHE CHANGED AND SHE BEGIN TO GIVE TESTIMONY. DID JESUS LAY HAND ON HER? &gt;&gt; DID JESUS SAY, "LEAVE YOU BAD SPIRIT?" &gt;&gt; WHAT DID JESUS DO &gt;&gt; WHEN HER FAITH HIT? PROSTITUTION SAID &gt;&gt; BECAUSE FAITH IS THE VICTORY THAT OVERCOME WHAT? &gt;&gt; SO THIS WORLD IF YOU WANT TO OVERCOME THIS WORLD &gt;&gt; ALL THE VICTORY OF EVERYTHING IN THIS WORLD is in faith. SO IN FAITH THERE IS A VICTORY. &gt;&gt; BROTHER BRHAM SAYS IN FAITH IS A VICTORY. HE SAYS FAITH IS WHAT? &gt;&gt; THE VICTORY. &gt;&gt; VICTORY OVER WHAT? &gt;&gt; DEATH. &gt;&gt; FAITH IS VICTORY OVER WHAT? &gt;&gt; SIN. &gt;&gt; FAITH IS VICTORY OVER WHAT? &gt;&gt; SICKNESS. &gt;&gt; FAITH IS VICTORY OVER WHAT? &gt;&gt; WORRY. &gt;&gt; FAITH IS VICTORY OVER WHAT? &gt;&gt; FRUSTRATION. &gt;&gt; FAITH IS VICTORY OVER WHAT? &gt;&gt; THE WORLD. IN OTHER WORDS, GOD GAVE YOU THE ESSENTIAL THINGS THAT IS THAT IT ALL TERRAIN. &gt;&gt; HE WILL OVERCOME EVERYTHING. &gt;&gt; YOUR HUSBAND IN FAITH, &gt;&gt; YOUR FURNITURE IN FAITH, THE WORLD IN FAITH, SICKNESS IN FAITH, WAR IN FAITH. THERE IS NOTHING THAT IS IN YOUR LIFE THAT YOUR FAITH CANNOT OVERCOME. AMEN. AMEN. AMEN. &gt;&gt; You start getting tired. &gt;&gt; YOU START GETTING TIRED. &gt;&gt; Some of you begin to get full. &gt;&gt; Stand up and jump and and stretch. Push the baby so you can get more. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Ah, praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Push it so we can get a bed. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; LISTEN TO THIS. WE KNOW WE KNOW ABOUT the the the armor of God. &gt;&gt; Put the the the &gt;&gt; helmet of salvation. Put this this put this put this put there. Listen to what he says. LISTEN TO GOD. NOW HE SAYS ABOVE ALL &gt;&gt; ABOVE EVERYTHING. &gt;&gt; YES SIR. ABOVE THE HELMET, ABOVE THE THE BELT, ABOVE THE BREASTPLATE. IN OTHER WORDS, WHAT IS ON TOP OF EVERYTHING &gt;&gt; IS WHAT? &gt;&gt; THE SHIELD OF FAITH. &gt;&gt; THE SHIELD OF WHAT? &gt;&gt; SO FAITH IS NOT ONLY ME OFFENSE, BUT IT'S ALSO DEFENSE. &gt;&gt; YOU ARE ATTACKING BY FAITH &gt;&gt; AND YOU ARE RESISTING BY FAITH. I DON'T KNOW IF WE TOGETHER. &gt;&gt; WHY IS THE MASTER only delivering a pound and he leave? &gt;&gt; Because the pound is victory to everything. THE POUND IS DOING EVERYTHING. THE POUND IS YOUR SHIELD. &gt;&gt; THE POUND IS YOUR FIGHT. &gt;&gt; THE POUND CAN BRING EVERYTHING. &gt;&gt; Are we together? HE SAYS, "ABOVE ALL THINGS, TAKE OFF WATER, &gt;&gt; THE SHIELD OF FAITH, &gt;&gt; WHEREWITH YOU SHALL BE ABLE TO WHAT? &gt;&gt; TO QUENCH ALL the fiery darts of the wicked." &gt;&gt; SO IF THE WICKED HAVE A FIERY DART &gt;&gt; COMING TO YOU, WHAT do you pull? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; When I'm saying this today, you're taking that, but you must put it to work. &gt;&gt; IN OTHER WORDS, I DON'T WANT TO HEAR ANY CRY BABIES. when it's coming. YOU SAY, "DEVIL, &gt;&gt; I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU MY FAITH." &gt;&gt; GOD TOLD ME, HE GAVE ME FAITH &gt;&gt; TO OVERCOME EVERY FIERY D. &gt;&gt; SO WHATEVER YOU TRY TO INTIMIDATE ME, TO DEPRESS ME, TO PUT ME DOWN, TO SHOW ME THAT I'M NOBODY, THAT I'M LEFT OVER, I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU I WAS BUILT MORE THAN THAT. I HOPE WE ARE TOGETHER. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; I HOPE WE ARE TOGETHER. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; I HOPE WE ARE TOGETHER. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; THIS IS WHAT KEEP YOU HAPPY &gt;&gt; IN THE MIDST OF TRIAL. &gt;&gt; WHEN TRIAL IS GOING AROUND, THE DEVIL IS EXPECTING YOU TO CRY. YOU ARE SMILING. &gt;&gt; LET THEM GOSSIP ABOUT ME. I AM SMILING. &gt;&gt; LET THEM TALK ABOUT ME. I'M SMILING. &gt;&gt; I DON'T CARE WHAT THEY SAY. I'M SMILING. &gt;&gt; THE LORD GIVETH. THE LORD TAKETH AWAY. &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; WHAT GOD delivered to the church &gt;&gt; is everything. &gt;&gt; Everything you need of is in faith. Amen. &gt;&gt; And not only that, &gt;&gt; can you swallow this? &gt;&gt; Because I have not gotten to the Holy Ghost yet. &gt;&gt; Not only that, BUT IT'S THIS BROTHER BRANDHAM SAY this word. &gt;&gt; Not the WORD THAT YOU OVERCOME, but the planet. &gt;&gt; THIS WORD WAS MADE BY WHAT? &gt;&gt; FAITH. WHAT GOD delivered to the church and left &gt;&gt; is the very thing that was creating everything. &gt;&gt; That's hard to swallow. &gt;&gt; In other words, what God can give you can create. HE GAVE YOU THE VERY THING he was using to create &gt;&gt; AND HE TOOK IT AND GAVE IT TO YOU AND GOD WENT TO HEAVEN AND SAT ON THE THRONE &gt;&gt; BECAUSE YOU GOT EVERYTHING. &gt;&gt; YOU GOT ME. &gt;&gt; You don't understand what I'm saying. Glory, glory, glory. &gt;&gt; This is for God. &gt;&gt; This is for God. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; God remove it. &gt;&gt; If the sword come from the chief, it means war, sister. &gt;&gt; And God took the unchief sword &gt;&gt; and give it to us. &gt;&gt; So who's going to fight &gt;&gt; in Sabino? THE SWORD CAME DOWN &gt;&gt; AND BROTHER BRANDHAM GRASP IT. &gt;&gt; BROTHER BRHAM SAY IT'S A SWORD OF A KING. THEY SAY &gt;&gt; IT IS NOT A KING. &gt;&gt; IT IS THE KING. &gt;&gt; IT IS THE SWORD OF JESUS HANDED BACK TO MEN. &gt;&gt; SO WHO'S GOING TO FIGHT JESUS? &gt;&gt; NO, IT IS THE BRIDE TO TAKE THE SWORD AND MOVE ON TO FIGHT. &gt;&gt; I don't know if you can understand. HOW CAN THE F HOW CAN THE SWORD OF JESUS FIT? Brother &gt;&gt; it means what? &gt;&gt; It means what? &gt;&gt; IF I GOT A SHOE I got a shoes &gt;&gt; and my boy wake up in the morning and he put the shoes and he got on his feet. Do you think I WILL TAKE THAT SHOE BACK AGAIN? &gt;&gt; It belongs to him. ARE WE TOGETHER? &gt;&gt; GOD IS SUPPOSED TO COME AND FIGHT THE BATTLE &gt;&gt; AND GOD TAKE THE WEAPON THAT HE HAS. &gt;&gt; What is HE GIVING YOU? &gt;&gt; WHAT IS HE GIVING YOU? &gt;&gt; AND BROTHER SAID THIS WORLD HERE WAS MADE BY WHAT? &gt;&gt; I know that's hard for you to swallow because of the carnal brain. ARE WE TOGETHER? BROTHER SAY THINGS WERE WHAT? &gt;&gt; SHAPED IN EXISTENCE &gt;&gt; BY WHAT? &gt;&gt; FAITH. &gt;&gt; When they tell you this, you are using your reasoning. &gt;&gt; And according to your reasoning, so I can create a planet. So what am I going to do with a planet? Conor mind. &gt;&gt; Miss the message. Do you need another planet? &gt;&gt; According to the plan of redemption, the planet is here. &gt;&gt; But what is God telling you? &gt;&gt; You can create your world. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Amen. &gt;&gt; God created the world by the word. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; In other words, YOU CAN BEGIN TO SHAPE YOUR LIFE. &gt;&gt; THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT. &gt;&gt; THE SAME POWER THAT CREATED, &gt;&gt; YOU CAN CREATE YOUR LIFE. YOU CAN SAY, "LISTEN, FROM 2015, &gt;&gt; FROM 2026, THIS IS THE MAN I'm going to be. &gt;&gt; I'M GOING TO BE FREE FROM DEATH. &gt;&gt; FREE FROM DEPRESSION. YOU GOING TO BEAT THIS &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THE WHAT GOD GAVE YOU IS WHAT GOD WAS SHAPING THINGS. &gt;&gt; You see this building here? IT WAS FRAME. SOMEBODY SAT AND IMAGINE AND PUT IT TO work &gt;&gt; and then deliver that and the building is there. &gt;&gt; The same power is in you. &gt;&gt; YOU CAN FRAME EVERYTHING AND SAY, YOU KNOW WHAT, THIS IS THE man I'm going to be. &gt;&gt; You're going to be a positive man. &gt;&gt; You will never cry again. &gt;&gt; You're going to be a man that will be looking at this. &gt;&gt; And then YOU BEGIN TO CHANGE YOUR BEHAVIOR. WHEN YOU WAKE UP, YOU SAY, "I'M NOT THE MAN I USED TO BE. I'M A DIFFERENT MAN IN 2026. I'M WALKING IN DIFFERENT GROUND. THIS YEAR IS MY YEAR OF DELIVERANCE. TOTAL DELIVERANCE. I MUST COME OUT OF THIS SITUATION. YOU NEED TO FRAME IT BY YOUR WORD USING YOUR FAITH. I don't KNOW HOW THE DEVIL CAN CONVINCE you to be COMFORTABLE IN THE STATE YOU ARE. &gt;&gt; AND YOU CALL THAT IT'S A TRIAL. &gt;&gt; SO TRIAL WAS GIVEN TO BE TRIAL OR TRIAL WAS GIVEN FOR GOD TO SHOW UP SO HE CAN COME OUT OF IT. &gt;&gt; YOUR TRIAL GOD NEVER SHOWED UP. WERE YOU BORN WITH THAT TRIAL? &gt;&gt; BROTHER SAY THINGS WERE SHAPED INTO EXISTENCE BY WHAT? &gt;&gt; GOD JUST SEEN THAT DO DROP. &gt;&gt; HE SEEN IT HANGING OUT there in the air THAT WHATEVER YOU WANT TO CALL IT. AND HE just did what? &gt;&gt; Spake. &gt;&gt; And he said, "Let there be." &gt;&gt; And there was what? &gt;&gt; Light. &gt;&gt; And then he brought the lamp forth and did what? &gt;&gt; And dried it off. And that was all done BY AN ACT OF WHAT? &gt;&gt; FAITH BY GOD. &gt;&gt; THE WHOLE WORD IS MADE BY WHAT? &gt;&gt; FAITH. &gt;&gt; IN OTHER WORDS, GOD HIMSELF USE FAITH. &gt;&gt; LORD, help help the church. &gt;&gt; God himself &gt;&gt; use faith &gt;&gt; to MAKE THINGS. AND GOD IS TAKING THE FAITH HE WAS USING and he's giving to you. &gt;&gt; Father, help this church. Listen to Paul. Listen to Paul. Paul understood that. &gt;&gt; And you have more than Paul. &gt;&gt; But listen to what Paul understood. &gt;&gt; Paul says, "I am what? &gt;&gt; CRUCIFIED WITH CHRIST. &gt;&gt; NEVERTHELESS, I DO WHAT? &gt;&gt; I LIVE." &gt;&gt; Yet what? &gt;&gt; Not I. &gt;&gt; But who? &gt;&gt; Christ liveth IN ME. &gt;&gt; THAT LIVE AND THE LIFE &gt;&gt; WHICH NOW NOW I live &gt;&gt; where? &gt;&gt; IN THE FLESH. &gt;&gt; SO PAUL WAS NOT A I MEAN I mean I mean a bird flying. He was human being. PAUL IS SAYING THE LIFE I'm living in as a human being in THE FLESH. &gt;&gt; I LIVE IT BY WHAT? &gt;&gt; THE FAITH OF THE SON OF GOD. &gt;&gt; THE FAITH OF WHO? &gt;&gt; THE SON OF GOD. &gt;&gt; Read it again. &gt;&gt; I'm living that by the faith &gt;&gt; of who? &gt;&gt; The son of God. &gt;&gt; SO THE FAITH BELONGED TO WHO? &gt;&gt; THE SON OF GOD. &gt;&gt; AND THAT FAITH WAS GIVEN TO WHO? &gt;&gt; TO PAUL. SO PAUL IS UTILIZING THE CREDIT CARD OF WHO? &gt;&gt; SON OF GOD. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; PAUL IS TELLING YOU WHATEVER YOU SEE ME DOING. &gt;&gt; I JUST BORROW A CREDIT CARD AND THE LIFE I'M LIVING WITH, IT IS NOT MY FAITH. IT IS HIS FAITH THAT HE DELIVERED TO ME AND I BEGIN TO USE IT. &gt;&gt; FATHER, help your children. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The disciples say increase our faith. &gt;&gt; On the day of Pentecost, God say because you will begin to say God have a different faith. Jesus have a different we are devil. The devil never came came out and we brought him to Jesus and Jesus delivered. So Jesus have a different level. Jesus saym I know my people. This is the faith I was using. Take it. SO YOU DON'T SAY MY FAITH ARE DIFFERENT. &gt;&gt; NO, NO. I GIVE YOU THE VERY THAT'S WHY I DELIVER TO YOU ONCE. &gt;&gt; And Paul AND PAUL IS SAYING THE LIFE I'M LIVING NOW THAT WHATEVER YOU SEE PAUL DOING, HEY YOU STOP THERE. BOOM. And the men stop. YOU BE BLIND. B IT HAPPENED. PAUL IS GOING AND PEOPLE are getting healed. He said what you see there is not me. It is the fifth &gt;&gt; of the son of man. &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? HE SAYS WHO DID WHAT? &gt;&gt; WHO LOVED ME &gt;&gt; AND DID WHAT? &gt;&gt; AND GAVE HIMSELF. &gt;&gt; BROTHER BRHAM SAY THIS WAS A WHAT? &gt;&gt; A LIVING FAITH. &gt;&gt; I LIVE BY THE FAITH OF WHAT? &gt;&gt; THE SON OF GOD. &gt;&gt; PAUL DID NOT SAY THAT. HE LIVED BY THE FAITH IN THE SON OF GOD. &gt;&gt; He did not say that. &gt;&gt; He did not say that.

HE KNEW THAT WHATEVER you have in the pan will take care of everything until he return. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; IN OTHER WORDS, WHATEVER YOU HAVE NEED OF IS IN THAT FAITH. &gt;&gt; UNTIL I COME BACK. &gt;&gt; AMEN.

AND I COST THE WATER. &gt;&gt; A QUARTER &gt;&gt; AND I HAD WATER. &gt;&gt; THE QUARTER. &gt;&gt; THE QUARTER IS NOT the loaf OF BREAD. &gt;&gt; THE QUARTER IS WHAT? &gt;&gt; The purchasing power of the loaf of bread. &gt;&gt; YOU SAY, "OH, I BELIEVE WHAT &gt;&gt; THE WORD &gt;&gt; THAT IS FINE." BUT IT IS THROUGH FAITH &gt;&gt; THAT PURCHASES &gt;&gt; THE HOLY SPIRIT. &gt;&gt; I know it's a ballistic missile. It's ringing. &gt;&gt; And oh, it's not me. &gt;&gt; It's not me. &gt;&gt; Let me read it again. Brother Robert, I'm heading to the airport, MY FRIEND. BROTHER BRHAM SAY, "BUT IT IS WHAT?" &gt;&gt; THROUGH FAITH. &gt;&gt; You tired, my friend? &gt;&gt; You need to preach with me. You need to preach with me. &gt;&gt; IT IS THROUGH FAITH THAT DOES WHAT? &gt;&gt; PURCHASES the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; I know your problem. It's like uh we are buying the Holy Ghost with money. No, you are buying the Holy Ghost with the money of God. &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost is bought with the money of God. &gt;&gt; And I can even shock you. I can even shock you if you want to. &gt;&gt; I can even shock you if you want to. &gt;&gt; You remember, right? &gt;&gt; Which offering did she give? &gt;&gt; She gave how many how much money? &gt;&gt; $20. &gt;&gt; She was a widow woman with two children. &gt;&gt; And the two children was the same sex. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And she brought $20. And when she gave $20, which was money naturally, what did what what happened to her children? &gt;&gt; It produced what? &gt;&gt; You have a problem with me. &gt;&gt; WHEN SHE GAVE $20 NATURALLY, THE $20 GAVE THE CHILDREN WHAT? &gt;&gt; You afraid to say &gt;&gt; HE GAVE THE CHILDREN WHAT? HOW CAN MONEY GIVE THE HOLY GHOST? &gt;&gt; IF YOU NOTICE THE PROPHET SAY FROM $20, THE PROPHET SAY HEALING &gt;&gt; BECAUSE YOU GAVE $20. BROTHER BRHAM SAY GOD KNEW. &gt;&gt; BROTHER BRANDHAM WANT TO RETURN THE MONEY. GOD SAID, "NO, &gt;&gt; LEAVE THE $20 &gt;&gt; BECAUSE OF THE $20 &gt;&gt; because of money. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE OF THE PURCHASE POWER, &gt;&gt; GOD FLIPS &gt;&gt; AND GOD SAY healing &gt;&gt; a million dollars. &gt;&gt; Remember, it's faith.

WHEN I START OPENING THIS STUFF NOW YOU QUIET. AND I DON'T WANT TO CONTINUE BECAUSE YOU ARE SOME OF YOU ARE LOST. &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? &gt;&gt; BROTHER SAY IT TAKES MONEY TO BUY THE TOKEN. &gt;&gt; IT TAKES THE SPIRITUAL MONEY &gt;&gt; CALLED FAITH &gt;&gt; TO PURCHASE THE HOLY GHOST. &gt;&gt; IF YOU NEED THE HOLY GHOST, YOU JUST NEED FAITH. &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY HE TOLD THE DISCIPLE, BUT YOU SHALL RECEIVE POWER. I ALREADY GAVE YOU THE FAITH. &gt;&gt; JUST GO WAIT &gt;&gt; IN THE UPPER ROOM. &gt;&gt; MASTER, WILL YOU AT THIS TIME RESTORE THE KINGDOM? Don't worry about it. You already received the faith. Go wait in Jerusalem &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THE FAITH I GAVE YOU IS GOING TO BUY YOU THE Holy Ghost. AND WHAT DID THE DISCIPLE DO? THEY WENT AND SIT down and begin to pray and praising the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; One day, two days, three day when he hit 10, &gt;&gt; according to the 10, &gt;&gt; THE FAITH OF A 10 POUND PULLED THE HOLY GHOST FROM HEAVEN. FATHER, help your children, brother. &gt;&gt; I'm feeling a resistance, so I'm trying to push. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's change gear, my friend. &gt;&gt; Okay, we ready? &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham say it IS THROUGH WHAT? &gt;&gt; FAITH. &gt;&gt; THAT PURCHASE WHAT? &gt;&gt; THE HOLY SPIRIT. &gt;&gt; SEE WHAT? &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; SO, WHAT PURCHASED THE HOLY GHOST? &gt;&gt; FAITH. &gt;&gt; What did God leave the church?

HE OVERCOMETH THE WORLD. HE ALSO PURCHASE THE HOLY GHOST. WHEN I say purchase the Holy Ghost, you got a problem. &gt;&gt; Let's read Paul &gt;&gt; in the book of Galatian. What? &gt;&gt; Three &gt;&gt; verse what? &gt;&gt; Two two to two and five. &gt;&gt; The Bible say this only with I learn of you. &gt;&gt; This is Paul. &gt;&gt; Receive ye what? &gt;&gt; The spirit &gt;&gt; BY THE WORKS OF the law &gt;&gt; or by what? the hearing of faith. &gt;&gt; So the Holy Ghost come how? &gt;&gt; By the hearing of faith. &gt;&gt; By the what? &gt;&gt; Hearing of faith. &gt;&gt; So you got to have a hearing &gt;&gt; of faith &gt;&gt; because it's the reading of faith. The hearing of faith &gt;&gt; that purchase the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; MY WORD ARE SPIRIT &gt;&gt; and they are truthful. &gt;&gt; AND WHEN MY WORD IS BEEN PREACHED, THE HEARING THAT YOU'RE HEARING &gt;&gt; of faith of revelation is WHAT BRING THE HOLY GHOST TO YOU. &gt;&gt; Let me read it again. It's hard. &gt;&gt; It's hard my friend &gt;&gt; because you got Holy Ghost by laying on hand. But I'm not talking about laying on hand &gt;&gt; because if I do something wrong, you will you will you will begin to think, okay, if that pastor who lay hand on me has uh backsliding, so what kind of Holy Spirit did I get from you? &gt;&gt; No, no. I'm I'm away from that. &gt;&gt; Me, I'm sitting here. I want God to lay hand on you himself. Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, &gt;&gt; are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; So, you don't DEPEND ON A MAN. &gt;&gt; NO, SIR. &gt;&gt; You have TO HAVE YOUR OWN ABSOLUTE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. AND PAUL IS SAYING THE HOLY GHOST, YOU RECEIVE IT BY THE HEARING OF IT. &gt;&gt; IN OTHER WORD, WHEN YOU ARE SITTING ON THE SERMON AND THE SERMON WAS GOING, SOMETHING WAS COMING TO YOU &gt;&gt; AND IT HIT YOU. AND WHEN IT HIT YOU, &gt;&gt; YOU SAY, &gt;&gt; "OH, MAN. &gt;&gt; I see it." &gt;&gt; WHEN YOU SEE IT, &gt;&gt; the woman at the just so &gt;&gt; I perceive. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You are. &gt;&gt; You are a prophet. AMEN. &gt;&gt; WHEN THE PROPHET OPEN UP, &gt;&gt; she drop everything. &gt;&gt; On fire. &gt;&gt; ON FIRE. &gt;&gt; ON FIRE. &gt;&gt; SHE FORGET WHO SHE WAS. &gt;&gt; SHE FORGOT SHE WAS A PROSTITUTE. &gt;&gt; She begin to go all over. Come and see. &gt;&gt; And she collected people. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Paul said, "RECEIVE YE THE HOLY GHOST BY WHAT?" &gt;&gt; By the works of THE LORD. OH, BY WHAT? &gt;&gt; The hearing of faith. &gt;&gt; THE THEREFORE THAT MINISTER TO YOU the spirit. &gt;&gt; In other words, the one that give you the Holy Ghost &gt;&gt; and work &gt;&gt; miracles AMONG &gt;&gt; THE ONE THAT does miracle among you and that give you the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; DOES HE DOES HE BY the works of THE LAW OR BY THE WHAT? &gt;&gt; The hearing OF FAITH. &gt;&gt; SO MIRACLE SHOULD HAPPEN HOW? &gt;&gt; And the Holy Ghost should happen how? by the hearing OF FAITH. SO THAT'S WHAT BROTHER WAS TRYING TO BRING THE CHURCH TO &gt;&gt; TO THE HIGH LEVEL OF THE WORD &gt;&gt; THAT WHEN THE WORD IS COMING &gt;&gt; RIGHT &gt;&gt; WHERE YOU ARE YOU ARE PULLING HEALING S &gt;&gt; YOU ARE PULLING DELIVERANCE &gt;&gt; YOU ARE PULLING MY HUSBAND &gt;&gt; I AM PULLING MY CHILD &gt;&gt; don't worry my friend Listen to this. IN 1 PETER 1:23, FLAT ATTEND and prepare for landing. Being born again, not of what &gt;&gt; corruptible seed, &gt;&gt; but what &gt;&gt; of incorruptible &gt;&gt; by what? &gt;&gt; The word of God &gt;&gt; which liveth and a bad of what &gt;&gt; forever. &gt;&gt; YOU ARE BORN BY NOT BY THE WORD OF God that is dead. &gt;&gt; NOW, &gt;&gt; WHAT GIVE YOU new birth is THE WORD OF GOD THAT LIVES. &gt;&gt; It's a living word. AMEN. &gt;&gt; IT'S A WORD WITH LIFE. &gt;&gt; AND PETER AND EPHESIANS SAY THAT CHRIST &gt;&gt; may what? &gt;&gt; Dwell in your heart. &gt;&gt; How? &gt;&gt; By faith. &gt;&gt; So what bring Christ in your heart? &gt;&gt; Faith. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; What bring Christ in your heart? &gt;&gt; Faith. &gt;&gt; How can you be baptized in the body? By what? &gt;&gt; Faith. &gt;&gt; Faith. &gt;&gt; Because faith purchased the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; IT IS FAITH THAT PULLED THE HOLY GHOST. AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. WHAT IS THE CAUSE of this misunderstanding? &gt;&gt; Because some say experience. &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. &gt;&gt; And we go through experience, we don't get it. &gt;&gt; Oh, &gt;&gt; how many how many testimony have I hear from young people? &gt;&gt; We went to the meeting over there. It was powerful. Yeah, &gt;&gt; I'm telling you the Lord came down. &gt;&gt; I was on the floor &gt;&gt; 3 month &gt;&gt; back up again to the same struggle. Oh, I thought you told me when you were in Minnesota, Louisiana or whatever camp that you went to, the Lord the day the Lord came down. &gt;&gt; HUH? &gt;&gt; HUH? SOME OF YOU WERE at the altar and when you come there you say now this thing is really tomorrow. &gt;&gt; Where is all the zeal? One week all the zeal all the fire is gone. &gt;&gt; SO NOW YOU'RE WAITING FOR THE NEXT CAMP. &gt;&gt; How many camps will you go to? Amen. &gt;&gt; HOW MANY TIMES WILL IT TESTIFY &gt;&gt; that you got the HOLY GHOST? &gt;&gt; HOW MANY TIME WILL YOU TESTIFY THAT SOMETHING HAPPENED TO ME? YOU SAY THAT 10 TIME YOU KEEP COMING back &gt;&gt; because we miss what the Holy Ghost is. We went with a Pentecostal understanding &gt;&gt; and we left the main thing &gt;&gt; and we begin to go from ONE CAMP TO ANOTHER FROM ONE CAMP TO ANOTHER. For what what we are looking for is a sensation &gt;&gt; AND WE CALL THAT EXPERIENCE. &gt;&gt; EXPERIENCE MAY PRODUCE SENSATION &gt;&gt; BUT NOT ALL SENSATIONAL EXPERIENCE. &gt;&gt; You can go home my friend. Are we together? &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? &gt;&gt; WHAT CAUSED THE PROBLEM? &gt;&gt; BROTHER BRHAM SAID THE PROBLEM THE MISUNDERSTANDING THE ANSWER IS WHAT? &gt;&gt; EXPERIENCE. &gt;&gt; WE HAVE GONE BY WHAT? &gt;&gt; EXPERIENCE. &gt;&gt; AND NOT BY THE WORD. &gt;&gt; THE WORD. AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. The true experience will bring you to THE WORD. &gt;&gt; YOUR EXPERIENCE NEVER BRING YOU TO THE WORD. &gt;&gt; MATTER OF FACT, YOU STILL FIGHTING WITH THE MESSAGE. &gt;&gt; YOU STILL FIGHTING WITH THE MESSAGE. YOU DON'T AGREE WITH CERTAIN THINGS IN THE MESSAGE. &gt;&gt; NO, that's not the Holy Ghost. THE HOLY GHOST WHEN HE COME WHEN HE HIT YOUR HEART &gt;&gt; YOU WILL NEVER FAST WITH THE MESSAGE &gt;&gt; EVEN IF YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND IT &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER BROTHER SAY AWAY WITH WHAT &gt;&gt; EXPERIENCE &gt;&gt; AS YOUR WHAT &gt;&gt; MEASURING LINE &gt;&gt; THERE IS ONLY ONE PLUMB LINE ONLY ONE ROAD THAT IS WHAT &gt;&gt; THE WORD. &gt;&gt; SO THE CHURCH NEED TO RECEIVE THE HOLY GHOST BY FAITH IN THE WORD. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; FATHER HELP US. HALLELUJAH. THERE IS ALWAYS DIFFICULT IN THE WAY. SATAN DOES WHAT? &gt;&gt; THROWS everything in the way he can. &gt;&gt; WHEN HE SEES A REAL MOVE OF GOD, &gt;&gt; GET STARTED. HE SHALL DO WHAT? &gt;&gt; Do it to you. &gt;&gt; He will put what? &gt;&gt; Everything. &gt;&gt; All the what? all the hindrances he can &gt;&gt; IN YOUR WAY. REMEMBER THE WOMAN HAD A LOT OF HINDRANCE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; BUT HER FAITH DIDN'T HAVE ANY. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; FAITH HAS WHAT? &gt;&gt; NO HINDRANCE. &gt;&gt; THERE IS NOTHING GOING TO STOP IT. &gt;&gt; NO MATTER WHAT ANYBODY SAY, IF YOU GOT THE RIGHT HOLD ON WHAT? &gt;&gt; GOD. &gt;&gt; GOD HAVE A RIGHT GOD. &gt;&gt; Let's read it again. &gt;&gt; IF YOU GOT THE RIGHT HOLD ON WHO? &gt;&gt; GOD. &gt;&gt; GOD HAS GOT THE RIGHT HOLD ON WHO? ON YOU. THERE CAN BE 40 DOCTORS &gt;&gt; STANDING HERE TELLING YOU YOU WAS DYING AND YOU WOULD NOT believe one word of it &gt;&gt; BECAUSE FAITH CAUGHT GOD AND GOD CAUGHT FAITH. &gt;&gt; IT IS IN THE DIFFERENT LEVEL THAT THE DEVIL CANNOT REACH. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; Brother Brham says this, "If you believe in the baptism of the Holy Spirit &gt;&gt; and the Holy Spirit get a hold OF YOU, &gt;&gt; HE SHALL BAPTIZE YOU. &gt;&gt; Let's finish this and you go home." Brother say if you believe in the water &gt;&gt; baptism of the Holy Spirit &gt;&gt; and the Holy Spirit get a hold of you &gt;&gt; AND HE SHALL BAPTIZE YOU &gt;&gt; and you get a hold of him you won't have to move from your seat &gt;&gt; let's stop here my friend some of you are tired Because this material is not game. &gt;&gt; No sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; No sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother say if you get a hold of the spirit of the lord &gt;&gt; and the spirit of the lord got a hold on you don't have to move from your seat. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So if you don't move from the spirit from your seat, what is how is the Holy Ghost coming to you? &gt;&gt; BROTHER SAID YOU DON'T HAVE TO MOVE. You won't have to move from your seat. &gt;&gt; He God will do what? &gt;&gt; Fill you &gt;&gt; with water. &gt;&gt; HIS PRESENCE &gt;&gt; RIGHT THERE WHERE YOU ARE. JUST AS HE DID, &gt;&gt; HE DID WHAT? &gt;&gt; YES. &gt;&gt; These words, &gt;&gt; THE HOLY GHOST DID WHAT? &gt;&gt; Fell on them that HEARD IT. &gt;&gt; THEM THAT DID WHAT? &gt;&gt; HEARD IT. &gt;&gt; THEM THAT DID WHAT? &gt;&gt; THAT HEARD IT. &gt;&gt; THAT DID WHAT? &gt;&gt; THAT HEARD IT. &gt;&gt; FAITH COMETH BY WHAT? &gt;&gt; BY HEARING. &gt;&gt; SO AS YOU HEARING THE WORD, &gt;&gt; THE HOLY GHOST ALSO COME. AND WHEN THE HOLY GHOST COME, YOU DON'T NEED ME. THE WORD IS COMING WITH THE SPIRIT. &gt;&gt; AND WHEN HE HIT YOU, SOMETHING BURN IN YOU AND SAY THAT'S NOTHING BUT THE TRUTH.
