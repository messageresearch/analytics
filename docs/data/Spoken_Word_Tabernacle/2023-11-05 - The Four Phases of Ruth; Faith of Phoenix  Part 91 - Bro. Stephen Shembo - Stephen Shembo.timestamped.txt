[24:10] amen amen y'all y'all can be seated for
[24:12] just a minute we do have
[24:14] a excuse me a couple of
[24:17] testimonies I'm going to ask brother
[24:19] Seth to go first
[24:22] amen sister Vivian has one but she's
[24:25] also going to sing a special for us this
[24:27] morning she's up here we just get her to
[24:29] sing to amen go ahead my
[24:32] brother God bless you Saints amen I'm
[24:36] just trying to keep it short uh because
[24:39] of
[24:40] time um we went for an appointment it
[24:44] was supposed to be a la appointment on
[24:47] Wednesday that's past Wednesday and then
[24:50] after the appointment on our way back
[24:53] home we were called to come back to see
[24:55] the doctor but then it was
[24:58] not supposed to be that was not the
[25:01] schedule and U later we found out what
[25:04] what the reising was um so when we went
[25:07] to see the
[25:09] doctor um
[25:11] he he made something very important to
[25:13] us now let me keep that as a piece now
[25:19] before my wife had a kidney um
[25:22] transplant um a couple of brothers were
[25:26] speaking that we are praying for two
[25:29] brand new
[25:30] kidneys that was what we were praying
[25:33] for and then when the transplant came it
[25:36] was one kidney now trying to join this
[25:39] together now when
[25:42] um we went to see the doctor right after
[25:45] the kidney
[25:46] transplant the doctor was like um we are
[25:49] aiming to see a 50 on one of the lab
[25:53] results because he explained that each
[25:57] kidney can produce a 50 so let's say one
[26:01] produces 50 the second produces a 50 and
[26:04] you get a 100 so when you have just one
[26:08] 50 is okay to operate with so the target
[26:12] was to hit a 50 because it was one
[26:14] kidney now so when we went to see the
[26:17] doctor that's on Wednesday when we're
[26:18] called back to see the doctor the
[26:21] doctors showed us that instead of one
[26:24] kidney producing a 50 we have a 100 and
[26:37] three so we have one kidney with a power
[26:40] of two and even
[26:42] more so we just want to thank the Lord
[26:44] for
[26:45] [Music]
[26:52] that
[26:54] amen
[26:56] amen
[27:01] hallelu Hallelujah
[27:05] Glory oh my
[27:08] goodness isn't he good isn't he
[27:11] [Applause]
[27:26] good
[27:30] Hallelujah that is what God can do for
[27:33] them he has done it for me amen I was
[27:36] here when my husband called me to say he
[27:39] want to go to see The Specialist to
[27:41] change his glasses I said that's good he
[27:44] went and he said H you need not to
[27:47] change your glasses but you have C on
[27:49] your both of the eyes how come we don't
[27:54] have to ask God question all that we
[27:56] know he has has to do it so they ask him
[28:00] to come for surgery on both eyes and

[1:05:07] dry very dry not dry but how very dry
[1:05:12] these Bonds were very
[1:05:16] dry in other word it's a situation that
[1:05:20] took place a long time that's right amen
[1:05:27] amen it is not a fresh
[1:05:30] situation because a flesh a fresh
[1:05:33] situation you will find the corpse there
[1:05:36] you will find the meat you find the
[1:05:38] people you can identify the person and
[1:05:40] say hey a crime happened here and this
[1:05:43] is how we need to start investigation in
[1:05:45] here there is no bones there is no
[1:05:47] muscles there is nothing it's only I
[1:05:50] mean uh I mean no flesh no muscles there
[1:05:53] is no sen there is nothing everything
[1:05:55] that you can see is bones and not not
[1:05:57] just bone they are very dry so it's a
[1:06:00] situation that happened a long time
[1:06:05] ago so it took time
[1:06:09] already amen am thank you Jesus that's
[1:06:13] how you read your
[1:06:15] Bible that's the way you read your Bible
[1:06:18] then when you start reading like this
[1:06:19] you begin to see
[1:06:20] things he says verse three and he says
[1:06:24] to me after the investigation after the
[1:06:26] examination as after he look at
[1:06:29] everything and evaluate everything then
[1:06:31] God turned to the prophet now ask him a
[1:06:34] question he says and he says to me son
[1:06:38] of man you the prophet can this born
[1:06:43] leave in other word after you evaluate
[1:06:47] the
[1:06:48] situation after you seen how serious the
[1:06:51] situation
[1:06:52] is and the disaster
[1:06:55] the
[1:06:55] destruction and the length of time that
[1:07:00] this
[1:07:02] situation has been there plunge into
[1:07:05] it do you think there is a hope to
[1:07:11] this can this bone
[1:07:14] leave if they were fresh you can say
[1:07:16] okay let's pray over this man he just
[1:07:18] died two hours ago maybe the Holy Spirit
[1:07:21] Will revive him oh Lord Jesus Christ
[1:07:23] revive our brother that can happen if
[1:07:26] it's 4 days you're going to pull the
[1:07:28] scripture you say Lord you were with
[1:07:29] Lazarus after 4 days corruption set you
[1:07:32] can do this Lazarus can come out this is
[1:07:35] not Lazarus
[1:07:36] place this is beyond
[1:07:39] Lazarus this is even Beyond Jesus
[1:07:43] [Applause]
[1:07:49] case so the
[1:07:52] situation of the of ezekia is beyond
[1:07:58] Christ because Jesus was within three
[1:08:01] days this one is more than three days
[1:08:04] everything is gone except the bone so
[1:08:07] it's a situation that is beyond any
[1:08:15] hope even Christ
[1:08:18] himself it's a situation greater than
[1:08:21] Jesus
[1:08:22] Christ
[1:08:24] when I say those kind of stuff some of
[1:08:26] you tremble tell tell the one behind you
[1:08:28] just
[1:08:29] relax everything is
[1:08:32] okay I got the scripture you see I got
[1:08:35] two two two stuff here do you see I got
[1:08:38] two stuff here there's one here one day
[1:08:41] so I got the the Bible and the message I
[1:08:43] got two
[1:08:44] guns so when I shoot from here I shoot
[1:08:47] from there okay so everything is okay
[1:08:50] all
[1:08:52] right so so he says son of man can this
[1:08:56] bond in other words is there any hope to
[1:08:59] this
[1:09:00] situation this have taken a long time
[1:09:03] all hope is gone do you think something
[1:09:06] can come out out of this
[1:09:09] chaos nothing left but bones can
[1:09:13] something good come out of here son of
[1:09:15] man you tell me verse three and I
[1:09:19] answered oh Lord God you know but Enoch
[1:09:24] watch the me the camera it's the one
[1:09:26] that have a tendency to autofocus and
[1:09:28] darken it amen he say oh Lord you know
[1:09:32] in other words the answer lays within
[1:09:35] who only God have the
[1:09:40] answer they ask the prophet what do you
[1:09:43] think about this the prophet say mm this
[1:09:46] type of situation even me myself a son
[1:09:49] of man I don't know this kind of stuff
[1:09:52] only they make care
[1:09:54] [Applause]

[1:10:00] God can give us the
[1:10:03] answer yes sir only God can give the
[1:10:07] answer only God knows the
[1:10:13] outcome so God need to tell us the
[1:10:15] outcome that's it what is the outcome
[1:10:19] verse uh four again he says to me

[1:14:33] you shall live and you shall know that I
[1:14:37] am the Lord so God is able to restore
[1:14:41] this situation all the way
[1:14:45] back to the
[1:14:47] [Applause]
[1:14:50] beginning so the message of Ezekiel to
[1:14:53] the Joy Bor it's a message of
[1:14:57] [Applause]
[1:15:00] restoration
[1:15:02] restoration back to the
[1:15:09] original how by the spoken
[1:15:14] word everybody okay they brought him in
[1:15:18] the valley where everything is
[1:15:21] chaos and they spoke word now is
[1:15:24] changing everything just like in Eden
[1:15:27] chaos it takes the spoken word to begin
[1:15:29] to restore back everything amen amen
[1:15:33] verse seven so I prophesy as I was
[1:15:38] commanded amen and as I prophesies there
[1:15:42] was a noise and behold a what a shaking
[1:15:47] and the B there is many ways you can
[1:15:49] take
[1:15:50] this I can go with Luther West Pentecost
[1:15:53] but I leave it that way I'm I'm I'm I'm
[1:15:55] I'm in a compound meeting I'm using a
[1:15:57] different uh highway now okay he says
[1:16:01] and there was a noise amen and behold
[1:16:04] they shaking and the bones came together
[1:16:07] how bone to bone bone to his bone if you
[1:16:10] notice this is coming
[1:16:15] gradually at the beginning the bones are
[1:16:19] scattered we don't know any
[1:16:21] identification it a confusion so when
[1:16:24] the prophet spoke the Bor first begin to
[1:16:27] go where he belongs in other word we
[1:16:29] begin to bring some
[1:16:34] order so before life come it start by
[1:16:38] bringing you back in
[1:16:40] [Music]
[1:16:42] order so we know which B belong to
[1:16:47] who everybody
[1:16:51] okay it's removing
[1:16:54] confusion maybe one bone was taken over
[1:16:57] there and suddenly the prophet see one
[1:17:00] bone flying over there and going over
[1:17:02] there only God knows the proper order
[1:17:07] only God knows where to put each B in
[1:17:10] the correct
[1:17:13] order there is nobody that can handle
[1:17:15] your life only God can handle your life
[1:17:20] only God knows where to push everything
[1:17:24] back in order
[1:17:26] amen because he's your maker the Holy
[1:17:29] One of Israel
[1:17:32] amen everybody okay oh my glory to
[1:17:38] God verse 8 and when I beheld loow the
[1:17:43] sen and the what flesh came a what upon
[1:17:46] them he came after first the bones are
[1:17:50] put in
[1:17:52] order because if you bring sen and flesh
[1:17:55] it's going to be disordered maybe your
[1:17:57] leg will remain over there and then your
[1:18:00] body is over here so first you must
[1:18:02] bring the bonds together so they sen you
[1:18:05] and the flesh knows which direction
[1:18:07] they're going to
[1:18:09] go everybody okay after the bones are
[1:18:13] back together then they begin to bring
[1:18:15] the senal connect the liament and the
[1:18:17] tendon together that's what the word
[1:18:19] senu
[1:18:20] means one connected m so to a bond one
[1:18:23] connect a bond to a bond it's a ligament
[1:18:26] and a tendon they begin to come together
[1:18:27] and connect and connect and connect then
[1:18:29] we know who belongs to who everybody
[1:18:33] okay and the sen and the flesh Came Upon
[1:18:35] them and the skin covered them above but
[1:18:38] there was no breath in water so we
[1:18:41] finish the first step everything is back
[1:18:43] to order now that everything is back to
[1:18:46] order let's bring them back to life amen
[1:18:50] verse n then say he to me
[1:18:53] everybody clear to the prophesies to who
[1:18:57] the wind you know what the winds mean in
[1:18:59] the scripture we already went through
[1:19:01] this the four wings wings Means
[1:19:04] War so these people were killed by
[1:19:13] War we already went through this place

[1:19:20] you quot and things wind the Bible Means
[1:19:25] War Winds Means War amen God say speak
[1:19:29] to the wind in other word it's the word
[1:19:32] that came and took their life
[1:19:34] away so you need to speak to the cause
[1:19:37] of the
[1:19:39] problem and tell the cause of the
[1:19:41] problem bring back what you took
[1:19:46] [Applause]
[1:19:49] here we need to speak to that devil that
[1:19:51] came yes
[1:19:53] yes amen he says and he and I prophesies
[1:19:58] verse 9 then say he prophesy to the wind
[1:20:02] prophesy son of man and say to the wind
[1:20:06] that sayi the Lord God come from the
[1:20:08] Four Winds we went through this you know
[1:20:10] what it means it's on YouTube oh breath
[1:20:14] and do what breathe upon the slain this
[1:20:17] breath is not like uh the wind that's a
[1:20:21] MOA this is the breath of life amen
[1:20:26] because the life can ride on the
[1:20:28] Wind as a
[1:20:31] chariot me go amen he says th serve the
[1:20:35] Lord God come from the Four Winds oh
[1:20:38] breath and breathe upon the Water slain
[1:20:41] so these people were
[1:20:45] killed now we begin to have more clarity
[1:20:48] yes sir these people were
[1:20:51] slain
[1:20:53] somebody killed them
[1:20:55] amen upon the slain that they may leave
[1:20:58] verse 10 so I prophesies as com he
[1:21:03] commanded me and the breath came into
[1:21:06] them and they leave and stood up upon
[1:21:10] their feet an exceeding what great Army
[1:21:14] so these people were a great
[1:21:18] Army we clear
[1:21:20] now the valley of a great
[1:21:24] Army
[1:21:26] amen if this great Army was slain it
[1:21:31] means that they were
[1:21:36] defeated everybody okay so it's a valley
[1:21:40] of
[1:21:43] defeat they lost the battle and a
[1:21:46] disaster happened a destruction happened
[1:21:50] and Destroy them we clear

[1:22:34] situation of Ezekiel 38 uh 37 it's a
[1:22:39] restoration from a situation where there
[1:22:42] is no hope that's
[1:22:45] right in other word when all hope is

[1:33:57] you coming up with a subject that is
[1:33:59] pulling stuff from
[1:34:01] mythology or from books that you read
[1:34:04] somewhere and try to put it in this
[1:34:06] church but you already established that
[1:34:08] in this pullit it's the Bible say and
[1:34:11] brother Bram say why do we have to learn
[1:34:14] about this

[1:34:22] do you bring stuff from other literature
[1:34:25] to bring it back here in this church
[1:34:28] let's go to the book of act chapter
[1:34:33] 17 glory to
[1:34:35] God everybody

[1:34:45] 17 if you there you can say amen
[1:34:49] amen the faith of
[1:34:53] Phoenix act chapter 17 let's go to verse
[1:34:57] 16 if you dare you can say amen
[1:35:00] amen the Bible says now while Paul
[1:35:04] waited for them at aim in
[1:35:07] Greeks his Spirit was stirred in him
[1:35:12] when he saw the
[1:35:14] city holy or
[1:35:17] completely given to idolatry so Paul
[1:35:20] went to the Greece city called a when
[1:35:24] Paul got into the city he be to observe
[1:35:28] the city and he found out that the whole
[1:35:30] city was in chaos everywhere there are
[1:35:34] adors Aros here altar here alter here
[1:35:38] alter here and it shocked the Apostle
[1:35:40] the prophet and when the Apostle look he
[1:35:43] said my God I never seen something like
[1:35:45] this this is a completely chaos
[1:35:48] everywhere I'm going it's only idolatry
[1:35:51] we clear jop to verse
[1:35:54] 22 to save time then Paul stood in the
[1:35:59] midst of Mor Hill they took him there
[1:36:02] and Paul said and said you men of aen I
[1:36:08] perceive that in all things you are too
[1:36:12] superstitious
[1:36:15] superstitious for as I passed by and
[1:36:18] beheld your devotions or your worship
[1:36:21] objects amen I found an
[1:36:25] altar with the inscription to the unnown
[1:36:30] God so Paul as he was passing by if he
[1:36:34] see a deity an ad that ad have a name
[1:36:38] that's correct this is Mars This is
[1:36:41] Jupiter this is Venus as he continue
[1:36:44] every altar have a name but Paul passed
[1:36:48] through an altar when he look the had so
[1:36:51] many gods until they ran out of
[1:36:57] name everybody okay so they came up with
[1:37:00] a new God that they call the unknown
[1:37:06] God so the hidden built an
[1:37:10] altar and they in the altar they put an
[1:37:14] incription says to the
[1:37:17] unknown to the unknown God every God
[1:37:20] have a name one we just call him an
[1:37:22] unknown God but every morning they are
[1:37:25] coming and they're worshiping the God if
[1:37:27] you ask them what is your name of your
[1:37:29] God he say it's an unknown
[1:37:32] God they are bringing offering which God
[1:37:35] unknown God Amen and then Paul used this
[1:37:41] Altar and begin to introduce Jesus
[1:37:44] Christ through this
[1:37:49] altar let's go go slowly my
[1:37:53] friend you need to have certain things
[1:37:55] to swallow this kind of stuff for I pass
[1:37:58] by verse 23 and beheld your devotion I
[1:38:02] found an altar which with this
[1:38:06] inscription to the unknown God whom
[1:38:09] therefore you ignorantly worship Him
[1:38:14] declare I what unto you Paul Ed a hidden
[1:38:20] altar and begin to introduce Jesus
[1:38:23] Christ through the
[1:38:25] altar that's right amen I'm going
[1:38:29] slowly verse
[1:38:31] 24 God that made the world and all
[1:38:35] things therein seeing that he is the
[1:38:38] Lord of Heaven and Earth dwells not in
[1:38:42] Temple made with hands amen neither is
[1:38:46] worship with man's hand as though he
[1:38:50] needed anything
[1:38:51] seeing he gives to all life and breath
[1:38:54] and all things everybody clear verse 26
[1:38:59] and has made of one blood all nations of
[1:39:03] men for to dwell on all the face of the
[1:39:06] Earth and has determined the time before
[1:39:08] appointed and the bonds of their in of
[1:39:12] their habitation verse 27 that he should
[1:39:15] seek the Lord that they should seek the
[1:39:18] Lord if happily in other words perhaps
[1:39:22] they might feel after him and find him
[1:39:25] though he be not far from every one of
[1:39:28] us watch verse 28 for in him God we live
[1:39:34] and move and have our being as certain
[1:39:39] also of your own poets Paul begin to use
[1:39:44] the
[1:39:45] litur of the Greek that's right Amen to
[1:39:50] introduce Jes Jesus
[1:39:54] Christ not only did Paul use the altar
[1:39:59] but Paul used also the
[1:40:03] literature of the poet in order to op to
[1:40:07] introduce Jesus Christ am amen Paul say
[1:40:11] of your own poet are you there amen your
[1:40:15] own poet have said for we are also his
[1:40:19] what Offspring so Paul
[1:40:21] a hidden prophet in order to introduce
[1:40:25] Jesus Christ and only Paul can do things
[1:40:29] like this only a prophet can do things
[1:40:32] like
[1:40:34] this everybody okay because people has
[1:40:37] been attacking brother
[1:40:39] Branham and they say that brother
[1:40:41] Branham spoke about
[1:40:43] Jonah that he read that Jonah the reason
[1:40:47] why he had to come up from a fish belly
[1:40:50] was because the people of nineve worship
[1:40:53] a fish God in the Bible it is not there
[1:40:57] but it take a prophet to draw that
[1:40:59] inspiration and to bring it to us if you
[1:41:02] have a problem with brother Bram
[1:41:04] bringing a story from somewhere you need
[1:41:07] to condemn
[1:41:09] Paul because Paul CED a poet from
[1:41:14] Eden do you follow me amen do you follow
[1:41:17] me amen if people have a problem with
[1:41:20] brother Bram reading a story and
[1:41:22] bringing that back in the message and
[1:41:24] when we quot that story they say this is
[1:41:27] not the Bible this is a story that came
[1:41:29] from somewhere you need to condemn the
[1:41:31] Apostle Paul because Paul CED a poet
[1:41:35] from the Heathen Amen in order to
[1:41:37] introduce Jesus
[1:41:42] Christ everybody okay you cannot fight a
[1:41:45] Vindicated
[1:41:47] Prophet everybody okay a Vindicated
[1:41:51] Prophet knows what to take when and to
[1:41:53] bring it back to us that's why we have
[1:41:56] confidence to repeat BR amen because
[1:41:58] brother Bram would never deviate from
[1:42:01] the Bible Paul did it and brother Bram
[1:42:04] did it and he preached like Paul that's
[1:42:07] why this message is zeroed in with the
[1:42:09] Bible amen everything everybody okay so
[1:42:12] far everybody good so far so brother
[1:42:16] stepen now we
[1:42:19] understand that pH you can pull it from
[1:42:22] the literature Paul did it but what does
[1:42:26] brother Bram say about
[1:42:30] Phoenix everybody okay Phoenix in the
[1:42:33] United States is a
[1:42:35] city in a city in the state of
[1:42:39] Arizona and it's the very capital of the
[1:42:42] state of Arizona I understand that
[1:42:45] brother Steven I read about uh uh uh
[1:42:49] what Phoenix on internet now I want to
[1:42:52] know what did Brother Bram say about it
[1:42:55] what is Phoenix William Maran Bram glory
[1:42:58] to God brother brandham says this about
[1:43:01] the City of Phoenix there is just
[1:43:04] something about Phoenix that I
[1:43:09] love I don't
[1:43:11] know it's just something in my heart
[1:43:14] that goes way down all down all since I
[1:43:18] was what a little boy said where in
[1:43:21] school I used to read of what Arizona
[1:43:24] how I always long to go where to Arizona
[1:43:27] and when I get here I just get how
[1:43:30] beside
[1:43:33] myself brother Bram say there is
[1:43:36] something about the City of Phoenix that
[1:43:39] he
[1:43:40] like something that he love and since he
[1:43:43] was a little boy when he read about
[1:43:45] Phoenix he always longed to go to
[1:43:47] Phoenix and as soon as he get in Phoenix
[1:43:50] it looks like the GPS of brother Bram
[1:43:53] get
[1:43:55] lost what is going on with
[1:43:58] Phoenix brother Branham in the message
[1:44:01] forsaking all in paragraph 24 brother
[1:44:05] Bram say this is a beautiful
[1:44:08] country everybody okay I don't think
[1:44:12] there is anything like it
[1:44:14] am I have ever seen what is that country
[1:44:18] brother Bram and Trav PR near every
[1:44:22] nation in the world and I have never

[1:57:18] this if Abraham believed God he never
[1:57:22] thought of what reasoning he never
[1:57:24] thought well now theand reason but Faith
[1:57:28] believes how anyhow against hope he did
[1:57:32] what believed in hope when there was not
[1:57:34] even a hope he still what believed
[1:57:38] anyhow and he was imputed to him for
[1:57:40] what righteousness and if you have not
[1:57:42] got that kind of Faith you are not
[1:57:45] Abraham's seed
[1:57:47] amen amen Amen to be Abraham's seed You
[1:57:53] Must Believe when there is no
[1:57:55] [Applause]

[1:58:05] phoenix you must believe that something
[1:58:08] can come out of of chaos that something
[1:58:11] can come out of Ru something can come
[1:58:14] out of
[1:58:16] nothing that is the Seed of Abraham
[1:58:20] when there is no money in the bank you

[1:58:26] table you believe
[1:58:28] God when there is no gas in the car you
[1:58:32] believe God to put gas
[1:58:34] [Applause]

[1:58:50] Brother Bram say what yes sir should we
[1:58:52] believe like Abraham did yes sir why the
[1:58:55] will Abraham SE the real Seed of Abraham
[1:58:59] what does you say well he was talking
[1:59:01] about what Jews oh no the Bible say if
[1:59:05] we be where in Christ then we take on
[1:59:08] what Abraham's seed and we are how HS
[1:59:11] according to the promise listen to
[1:59:13] brother Bram brother Bram say against
[1:59:16] hope yet believe what in Hope hop is are
[1:59:19] gone yet what he believed in it when
[1:59:23] hope was done what dead to who to him
[1:59:26] Hope was dead to every scientific search
[1:59:29] every resource of wisdom Hope was gone
[1:59:32] but still he believ in it what was it it
[1:59:36] was what faith in it faith in hope when
[1:59:39] hope was not there in other word for
[1:59:43] fith out of
[1:59:48] nothing huh I like to linger on that a
[1:59:52] while faith in hope when there was no
[1:59:56] hope there yet he still believe in what
[1:59:59] hope in other words there is not even a
[2:00:01] substance to hope for but Abraham hoped
[2:00:04] for what kind of faith is
[2:00:07] that it's not when hope is you can have
[2:00:10] a born but when there is nothing Abraham
[2:00:13] still
[2:00:14] believe when hope is completely gone but

[2:01:10] word Phoenix means something that is
[2:01:13] come out of nothing now that might be
[2:01:17] the wrong expression but I think that is
[2:01:19] something on that order that this city
[2:01:21] was built out of a desert here just
[2:01:24] right in the middle of a desert so he
[2:01:27] rose out of
[2:01:29] chaos amen amen and a few years ago I
[2:01:33] come into into the city some 10 or 15

[2:01:43] churches you could hardly get they say

[2:04:02] the faith of a phoenix even after the
[2:04:05] Rapture God will still have a
[2:04:08] phoenix amen what is that Phoenix
[2:04:11] brother Bram says this he says we are at
[2:04:14] the end and you see we are at the end
[2:04:17] there is not no way to build upon that
[2:04:20] corruption how can we build a city upon
[2:04:23] the ched ruins of a Sodom and gomorra
[2:04:26] how can we do it there is only one
[2:04:29] Phoenix
[2:04:30] left everybody okay and that is the
[2:04:33] coming of what the Lord Jesus Oh My a
[2:04:37] what a purification through the what
[2:04:40] tribulation period to bring back and
[2:04:42] restore what oh the to bring back a
[2:04:45] restoring of the world for a people who
[2:04:48] are just in the sight of the Lord of God
[2:04:51] and live by his what word that's why
[2:04:54] Romans said that even nature is crying
[2:04:58] nature is looking to be delivered from
[2:05:01] the bondage of corruption and what
[2:05:03] brother Bram is saying here that even
[2:05:05] the Earth will receive a phoenix that's
[2:05:08] why we have the war in Israel that's why
[2:05:11] we have the war in Russia everything is
[2:05:13] preparing toward Armageddon because in
[2:05:16] Armageddon everything will be Ash
[2:05:19] but God will have a phoenix in the
[2:05:22] Millennium God will resurrect everything
[2:05:25] back up
[2:05:27] again and bring a new world order under
[2:05:31] a new Phoenix where the children of God
[2:05:34] will be jubilating in here and Satan
[2:05:36] will be bned for a thousand years and
[2:05:39] we're going to rule and reign with
[2:05:40] Christ on this Earth to fulfill the one
[2:05:43] day of Adam everybody okay everybody
[2:05:46] clear so we found out that when we read
[2:05:49] our scripture this
[2:05:51] morning in Genesis 1 God created the
[2:05:55] mess he created the Earth without form
[2:05:59] he created the Earth void he created the
[2:06:02] Earth with Darkness amen and we found
[2:06:05] that when God created the Earth the
[2:06:07] spirit of the Lord came spoke and
[2:06:10] changed the situation of the world Amen
[2:06:12] everybody okay and Paul pick up that
[2:06:15] scripture and bring us to that scripture
[2:06:17] in second Corin
[2:06:19] saying that the way the same way God
[2:06:22] spoke to the Earth is the same way God
[2:06:24] is dealing with our life because on our
[2:06:28] birth we were also born in a mess and
[2:06:30] God come by the spoken word and he speak
[2:06:33] to our heart and when God speak to our
[2:06:35] heart he brings a
[2:06:38] transformation what is the meaning of
[2:06:40] that
[2:06:41] transformation William Marion Branham
[2:06:44] brother Bram says this follow me brother
[2:06:47] Bram say the greatest
[2:06:51] Miracle ever
[2:06:53] perform when God can take something and
[2:06:57] do what convert it and bring it back to
[2:07:00] itself
[2:07:02] again brother the Bram say the greatest
[2:07:04] miracle that God can do is when God take
[2:07:08] something and convert it and bring it
[2:07:11] back again to itself again follow me
[2:07:14] carefully brother Bram say just the same
[2:07:17] as you could take it Animal by science
[2:07:20] and drop a little drop of water on top
[2:07:23] of that hug and make it what a lamb now
[2:07:26] that is the miracle of it he changed his
[2:07:29] whole what nature he changed what
[2:07:31] appetite it changed What attitude it
[2:07:33] changed what everything that is what God
[2:07:36] does when he save a man from what sin he
[2:07:39] change his entire what
[2:07:41] makeup so greater a miracle than any
[2:07:44] part of what Divine
[2:07:47] Healing
[2:07:50] I know where we heading that is that I
[2:07:53] ever seen and I by the grace of God I
[2:07:57] have seen pretty near everything that I
[2:08:00] could ever of or hear of done by our
[2:08:04] Lord who Jesus even to raising up the
[2:08:07] dead after they were what gone and
[2:08:10] still I think that salvation is what the
[2:08:14] greatest
[2:08:17] miracle brother pram says that the
[2:08:20] greatest Miracle the top miracle of God
[2:08:24] is when God can change
[2:08:27] you and brother Bram said that Miracle
[2:08:30] is greater than Divine
[2:08:33] Healing brother saying I seen all kind
[2:08:36] of stuff that God did but despite
[2:08:39] everything raising the dead healing the
[2:08:41] leopard doing this this opening the eyes
[2:08:44] of the blond there is nothing that can
[2:08:46] be compared to salvation
[2:08:54] Hall I'm saying this to change our mind
[2:08:58] because if they tell you that somebody
[2:09:00] have a lamp here on and then they pray
[2:09:03] for him and the lamp came down and fell
[2:09:05] on the ground and I ask you a question I
[2:09:08] say look at a sinner from the street he
[2:09:11] came there we pray for the sinner The
[2:09:14] Sinner changed and now he become a
[2:09:16] Believer if we ask you a question
[2:09:18] between those two which one is the great
[2:09:20] miracle you will say it's the one that
[2:09:23] the cancer dropped from the head it's a
[2:09:25] Pentecost of
[2:09:27] thinking everybody okay if they ask you
[2:09:30] which Miracle is great you will say m
[2:09:32] the greatest Miracle is this one not
[2:09:34] that
[2:09:37] one I'm going to go higher
[2:09:40] again if I speak something right now and
[2:09:44] then a squirrel come here do you follow
[2:09:47] me come on and then we bring a sinner
[2:09:50] from the street and The Sinner give his
[2:09:53] light to the Lord if I ask you a
[2:09:56] question between the square and The
[2:09:59] Sinner which one is greater do you know
[2:10:02] what you're going to tell me the
[2:10:04] creation of the
[2:10:06] square you going to say the creation of
[2:10:08] the square today I'm helping you I'm
[2:10:12] recalibrating your gun the little simple
[2:10:15] thing that God did for you
[2:10:18] is greater than
[2:10:21] [Applause]
[2:10:28] anything why why why are you saying that
[2:10:32] why are you brother without this message
[2:10:35] we could be a chaos it takes a prophet
[2:10:40] to bring us back to the
[2:10:42] word amen Amen brother Brown I'm saying
[2:10:46] despite everything nothing is compared
[2:10:48] to
[2:10:49] Salvation where are you going pastor we
[2:10:53] talking about the faith of Phoenix hang
[2:10:55] tight my friend it's a different ship
[2:10:58] today I'm using a military
[2:11:02] airplane not a commercial today it's a
[2:11:05] military one so you need to hang tight
[2:11:08] glory to God because the military
[2:11:10] airplane can flip not a commercial one
[2:11:13] so hang tight my friend brother Bram
[2:11:16] says this Hallelujah he says you can be
[2:11:19] certain you can know uh and you can know
[2:11:23] it to
[2:11:24] be if he never perform any more Miracle
[2:11:29] on you but the what great miracle in
[2:11:32] other word if God doesn't give you
[2:11:35] anything in your life nothing else in
[2:11:38] your life but God does
[2:11:41] only one thing what is that one thing
[2:11:44] and that one thing brother brandham is
[2:11:46] calling that the greatest miracle what
[2:11:48] is the greatest Miracle brother Bram say
[2:11:51] if God if he never perform any more
[2:11:54] Miracle on you but what the great
[2:11:56] miracle which is the greatest Miracle of
[2:11:58] doing what forgives your sin that is the
[2:12:02] greatest miracle that God ever what
[2:12:04] perform was to forgive a what human
[2:12:11] [Applause]
[2:12:17] being
[2:12:19] [Applause]
[2:12:23] but the Bram is saying if God never done
[2:12:26] anything to you but he does only one
[2:12:29] thing to forgive your sin God did the
[2:12:32] greatest Miracle what are you trying to
[2:12:35] say with this brother brandham says this
[2:12:37] in the message persevering God has done
[2:12:41] something for you he did what saved you
[2:12:44] that is the what greatest Miracle there
[2:12:47] is isn't that wonderful what happened
[2:12:51] that is the what greatest miracle that
[2:12:54] ever performed when God come to the
[2:12:57] heart and do what
[2:13:01] speaks when God comes in your heart and
[2:13:04] he speak to your heart and he forgive
[2:13:06] your sin brother Bram say God fulfilled
[2:13:10] the greatest Miracle
[2:13:14] ever I know your thought you want me to
[2:13:16] say the creation is the greatest
[2:13:19] Miracles but you don't understand God
[2:13:21] yet he's hidden in Simplicity and watch
[2:13:25] what is next coming brother brandham
[2:13:27] says this my God he said how do you take
[2:13:30] a sinner like me and like you and make a
[2:13:34] Christian out of us I can't understand
[2:13:37] it that is the what greatest miracle
[2:13:41] that that God have a what performed is
[2:13:43] when he took a what a sinner and made a
[2:13:46] what a Christian out of us
[2:13:50] this is your problem this is your
[2:13:53] problem what your problem brother Bram
[2:13:56] say if you can look here you believe
[2:14:00] that God can save anybody from sin
[2:14:03] because you have been taught
[2:14:06] that that's the reason why it's more
[2:14:09] common to you hallu but you don't
[2:14:13] understand the power within
[2:14:16] it what God did to your life is what he
[2:14:20] did in
[2:14:22] Genesis the transformation of this world
[2:14:26] is what God to you did to you as an
[2:14:32] [Applause]
[2:14:34] individual if they tell you that God
[2:14:37] enter the word and say let there be
[2:14:41] light and he turned around he said let
[2:14:44] there be trees Let There Be Mountain you
[2:14:46] say my God that's a powerful God and
[2:14:49] Paul say the same power he used to to to
[2:14:54] to transform the Earth is the same thing
[2:14:57] he has to use to transform you but the
[2:15:01] problem is you beling in yourself and
[2:15:04] you looking at the one in Genesis to be
[2:15:09] greater let's continue my friend brother
[2:15:12] Bram say well that is as a far more what
[2:15:16] of a miracle then a man was who was what
[2:15:20] dead in trespasses and see that man is
[2:15:22] how dead and he had to believe or remain
[2:15:25] how dead then after you are born again
[2:15:28] you become a what a Son of God how much
[2:15:31] more ought you to believe for a what
[2:15:34] lesser
[2:15:34] [Applause]

[2:15:39] catch that did you catch that andless a
[2:15:42] miracle for what Divine Healing if I
[2:15:45] live ought to be if aive
[2:15:49] man ought to be more than a what dead
[2:15:54] man some of you didn't catch
[2:15:56] it let me help you out are you ready are
[2:16:01] you ready brother Bram say when God come
[2:16:04] to you the greatest thing God can do in
[2:16:08] your life is to save
[2:16:10] you in other word god started with you
[2:16:15] from the
[2:16:16] top

[2:16:24] me to to for God to catch you he have to
[2:16:29] use his last
[2:16:31] weapon Jesus I don't know if you getting

[2:37:52] will put among human being to ask
[2:37:55] anything you will and he will give it to
[2:37:58] you it is too deep for my mind amen I
[2:38:03] know but I hope in my heart can contain
[2:38:06] as much of it as I can
[2:38:08] amen listen to brother Bram back he said
[2:38:12] we know his word is a paradox amen when
[2:38:15] it's prom is something so unreal to the
[2:38:18] word something they cannot prescribe to
[2:38:21] it is something beyond their knowledge
[2:38:24] and understanding but when a simple
[2:38:26] heart will take that word and sink into
[2:38:30] the depth of its own
[2:38:32] being then that word will produce the
[2:38:35] life fact of that
[2:38:39] promise the faith of
[2:38:41] Phoenix Hallelujah listen to this
[2:38:45] William Mar Bram he says what makes a
[2:38:48] paradox is when something when somebody
[2:38:51] believe God and take him at what his
[2:38:55] word God's word spoke the world into
[2:38:58] existence that is the same thing you
[2:39:01] have to believe tonight it's God what
[2:39:03] promised word listen to this brother
[2:39:06] brandham say Jeri let me drop here but

[2:39:19] leave and he turn around and say I have
[2:39:22] never seen Faith like that in Israel
[2:39:24] there it is we are supposed to be on
[2:39:28] that higher level on the no no we are
[2:39:30] supposed to be on a higher level than
[2:39:34] that
[2:39:35] was amen we are living on a closer of
[2:39:40] the world's end then we were then the
[2:39:43] Gentile way is to believe believe the
[2:39:46] word that is exactly right recognize
[2:39:49] look at the Gentile back up I'm going to
[2:39:52] the airport listen to this brother Bram
[2:39:55] said leprosy there was no cure for
[2:39:58] leprosy they have not found it yet only
[2:40:01] God can Kure leprosy they have not found
[2:40:04] even nothing for it to helpen but it's a
[2:40:07] type of sin he sets in her so gradual
[2:40:11] it's penless just move right in you
[2:40:13] don't know it until you are dying
[2:40:16] Big W white wordss come all over and
[2:40:20] lamps jop off and everything itat you

[2:40:49] in the revelation of my faith what
[2:40:53] happened in Sabino the other day I

[2:40:58] when what missing limbs will be restored
[2:41:01] missing lamps will be restored and the
[2:41:04] glorious power of the Creator I believe
[2:41:06] if he can make SW to appear that has
[2:41:09] nowhere here is the man or a woman just
[2:41:12] got a missing part and that is a
[2:41:14] complete animal it's self he is God I
[2:41:17] love him in other word even if something
[2:41:19] is missing something has been cut off we
[2:41:22] have a phic a faith that can bring
[2:41:25] something out of
[2:41:28] nothing Lord help me out brother uh HEI

[2:42:29] beings and the Temple of the Lord was
[2:42:31] the Lord Jesus Christ which was the
[2:42:34] house of the Lord so Jesus himself as

[2:42:59] the glory not of the first
[2:43:02] temple but the glory of the last Temple
[2:43:05] is going to be greater than the first
[2:43:09] temple can I continue can I continue God

[2:44:23] says this those in the BR do only what
[2:44:27] his will no one can make them do otheres
[2:44:31] they have what thus sayith the Lord oh
[2:44:33] they do what keep still they shut up
[2:44:36] they know that he has to be God in them
[2:44:41] doing the work fulfilling his own what
[2:44:44] word
[2:44:46] he did not complete all his
[2:44:50] work Jesus didn't complete all his work
[2:44:54] while his Earthly Ministry so now he
[2:44:58] works in and through the what right she
[2:45:01] knows that for it was not yet time for
[2:45:05] him to do certain things that must be
[2:45:09] that he must do when now but he will now
[2:45:14] fulfill where through the bride that
[2:45:17] work which he left for what this
[2:45:20] specific
[2:45:23] time everybody okay everybody okay
[2:45:26] remember the glory of the last must be
[2:45:30] greater than
[2:45:32] what the glory of the first house in
[2:45:35] other words this anointing will do
[2:45:38] things greater than the ministry of
[2:45:40] Jesus
[2:45:44] Christ
[2:45:47] father help me up brother Bram say I'm a
[2:45:50] jobson No Stranger among us tonight in
[2:45:54] other word no new people who don't know
[2:45:56] about the message of the hour brother BR
[2:45:58] want to make sure they're not around
[2:46:00] because he's going to drop an atomic
[2:46:01] bomb he says I suppose so in this prayer
[2:46:05] meeting but let me say something now
[2:46:09] this is for thinking not probably rather
[2:46:12] notice just for thinking Jesus said in
[2:46:15] St John what 1412 he that believe on
[2:46:19] what me the work that I do shall he do
[2:46:22] what also and how greater than what this
[2:46:26] shall he do greater than who
[2:46:31] Jesus so it's possible to do something
[2:46:34] greater than
[2:46:39] Jesus do you believe the Bible do you
[2:46:42] believe the Bible amen he said greater
[2:46:45] then this shall he do for I go to my
[2:46:47] what father did you notice that notice
[2:46:51] now that was the son of God promising to
[2:46:55] the believer that greater things than he
[2:46:58] did am in these last day that the
[2:47:01] believer will do greater things than he
[2:47:04] did is that right do you believe Jesus
[2:47:07] said it
[2:47:12] amen everybody okay remember Phoenix
[2:47:16] have two part Phoenix can work from the
[2:47:21] ruin or the chaos all Phoenix can work
[2:47:25] out of what
[2:47:27] nothing William Maran Bram notice when
[2:47:31] Jesus created what bread he took a piece
[2:47:35] and created a bread that had already
[2:47:38] been what bre when he created a fish he
[2:47:42] took a fish that was first what created
[2:47:44] what a fish and put another what fish
[2:47:47] out of it is that right he took what
[2:47:50] water which potentially would become
[2:47:52] what wine and made it what wine out of
[2:47:55] it is that right yes but we have seen
[2:47:57] him in our midst when in this last days
[2:48:02] created things right out without what
[2:48:05] standing there is that right uh-huh to
[2:48:08] create a squirrel when there was what no
[2:48:11] squirrel he remains God he's just much
[2:48:15] what deity today as he was then and ever
[2:48:19] was all ever will be he still what God I
[2:48:23] do what and challenging Hearts to
[2:48:25] believe it greater things than this
[2:48:27] without anything to hold and what break
[2:48:30] off what speak it and it shall be what
[2:48:35] so
[2:48:39] amen hallelujah just what I have seen in
[2:48:43] my own Ministry seen him done you could
[2:48:47] you couldn't pile the volume on on uh
[2:48:50] the volume on this platform here if I
[2:48:53] wrote it in details what I seen him do
[2:48:57] just in my own Ministry seen him do do
[2:49:01] it he had more what success in my
[2:49:05] Ministry than he did in his
[2:49:10] own this is right this is recording now
[2:49:14] remember he had more success now not me
[2:49:18] he had Glory Hallelujah he had more what
[2:49:22] success where in Jeffersonville then he
[2:49:24] did where in
[2:49:30] Nazareth can you SW that
[2:49:34] amen he did it in that Wicked City in
[2:49:38] this wicked City amen glory because he
[2:49:41] could perform no Miracle there but he
[2:49:44] did it here here he finally broke
[2:49:46] through here he got it done here he
[2:49:49] might have had to get people somewhere
[2:49:51] but he got it done anyhow when Jesus
[2:49:54] could reach a point if the people didn't
[2:49:56] believe he don't do he he didn't do the
[2:49:58] miracle he goes away but with brother
[2:50:01] brandham Ministry your unbelief cannot
[2:50:03] stop the third
[2:50:05] po that's why even the children of haty
[2:50:08] right when they were making fun of the
[2:50:11] Prophet God bypassed their repentance
[2:50:14] and struck their heart and brought them
[2:50:17] back to
[2:50:17] [Applause]
[2:50:22] Salvation oh my God he says so he had
[2:50:25] more what success success right here
[2:50:28] than he did in Capernaum oh Nazareth he
[2:50:32] done more Miracle right here in this
[2:50:36] Tabernacle than he did in the entire
[2:50:39] Ministry on Earth that's right he did it
[2:50:43] now what about the rest of the
[2:50:47] world God is a god of a
[2:50:51] phoenix where there is chaos where there
[2:50:54] is no hope where everything is gone to
[2:50:57] ruin amen where there is distraction
[2:51:00] everywhere something that is open a
[2:51:03] reputation destroyed everything damage
[2:51:07] open to the public you become a a I mean
[2:51:10] a by word in the message people
[2:51:13] everybody talk about you there is still
[2:51:16] a phoenix you can Rise Up from those
[2:51:18] ashes you can Rise Up from that

[2:51:23] situation God is able to renew
[2:51:26] everything back again and restore you
[2:51:28] back out of
[2:51:30] nothing why because he saved you if he
[2:51:33] saves you there is nothing in your life
[2:51:36] that God cannot give you the salvation
[2:51:38] of God is a signal to show you that I
[2:51:41] can give you the toughest things that I
[2:51:43] can everything else in your life it
[2:51:46] depends on your faith it depends on what
[2:51:48] you think I am for you if you think I
[2:51:51] can provide there is nothing that I
[2:51:53] cannot provide if your salvation is
[2:51:55] fixed then you can get the remaining of
[2:51:57] the things if your salvation is not
[2:52:00] fixed yet first get the Salvation once
[2:52:03] the Salvation question is over then you
[2:52:05] will have the right to begin to ask God
[2:52:08] anything that you want in your life

[2:52:12] level you have to believe for the Lesser

[2:52:17] up again the faith of pH God bless you

[2:53:05] chaos God can raise you up out of that
[2:53:09] ruin God can raise you up out of that
[2:53:12] situation that you have examined
[2:53:15] you have walked around it in your night
[2:53:18] thinking over it going over it pondering
[2:53:21] over it looking at this aspect and this
[2:53:24] aspect to figure it out which way can I
[2:53:26] come out of it amen God is telling you
[2:53:29] today he's a god of

[2:53:39] God can restore God can bring life God
[2:53:43] can touch that Stu born child that have
[2:53:45] been sassing at you and giving you the
[2:53:48] hardest fit that you ever have the third
[2:53:51] pool haveen answer for
[2:53:53] that let's pray Heavenly
[2:53:57] Father Lord we are approaching you again
[2:54:00] humbly this
[2:54:02] afternoon father we thank you for your
[2:54:04] grace we thank you for your love we
[2:54:08] thank you for your mercy and we thank
[2:54:10] you for the faith of Phoenix Lord
[2:54:13] because you the god that against hope
[2:54:18] you can bring
[2:54:19] something you show to us Lord that you
[2:54:23] coming in our life in the way of
[2:54:25] Salvation it was the greatest expression
[2:54:28] of your love every that you can display
[2:54:32] in our life it is something that is
[2:54:35] eternal that throughout eternity we hold
[2:54:40] in our Earthly vessel eternal life that
[2:54:43] would never been taken away because we
[2:54:46] are sealed until the day of redemption
[2:54:49] and father your Prophet explained to us
[2:54:52] that if you can give us the greatest
[2:54:54] gift ever how much more about the Lesser
[2:54:58] thing should we have even Faith Lord but
[2:55:01] father the tradition and the Creeds and
[2:55:05] theology have taken salvation and put it
[2:55:09] down like something that is nothing no
[2:55:12] wonder the sincerity by salvation has
[2:55:15] been lost completely until people comes
[2:55:18] to the altar chewing them people comes
[2:55:21] to the altar not even having their mind
[2:55:23] set up and go back again into the mark
[2:55:26] of sin Lord but if a genuine salvation
[2:55:29] have happened and you have spoken to the
[2:55:32] heart of someone father and bring
[2:55:35] Salvation and eternal life that is the
[2:55:37] greatest thing that you can do and it's
[2:55:39] a signal to that person that you have
[2:55:42] approved their faith and whatever they
[2:55:44] need in their life Journey you are
[2:55:47] Jehovah jarra you will supply it Lord
[2:55:50] because you are there to be with us to
[2:55:52] be in us and to lead us and to guide us

[2:56:01] online you know where they are you know
[2:56:04] where they have
[2:56:05] defeat where they fail where they messed
[2:56:09] up you know what kind of mess the devil
[2:56:12] put them maybe they found thems in the
[2:56:15] messes of depth that they don't know how
[2:56:17] to come out of it maybe they found thems
[2:56:21] into a depth of credit cards they don't
[2:56:23] even know how to pay them and come out
[2:56:25] maybe there is a situation that the
[2:56:27] record is destroyed the credit score is
[2:56:30] destroyed the family is completely wiped
[2:56:33] out it looks like everything that they
[2:56:36] have attempted is not working they are
[2:56:39] locked their mind is stuck they don't
[2:56:42] know anything
[2:56:44] father you the god of phelix may you
[2:56:48] come Lord and bring that hope and open
[2:56:51] the way and bring them Lord father back
[2:56:54] again and restore them so we can
