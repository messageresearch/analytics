even be strong and be to the Eternal plane amen let's give them a clap of amen glory to God amen that's a wonderful song and it's related to the revelation of what you're getting amen glory to God with what you're getting not only here but what a broad is getting all over the world Amen even when you listen to a song you need you should be able not to start filtering the song through the Revelation that you got amen if a song doesn't match your Revelation you reject it don't sing it can you give me more of the volume by David so I don't have to worry about it who's saying amen amen amen glory to God praise God that's what I'm saying amen amen amen so if you if God unfolded something to you God is calling you to that level and once you reach that level everything that God opened your eyes to that is no longer good to you you gotta let it go amen amen in other words if God opened the message of Wesley you cannot continue to worship God under Luther You're Gonna Miss God God is already moving you gotta move with the pillar of fight you cannot stay on the looter and trying to please God anymore amen so in other words as you grow up like Paul say when I see you might be seated go to First Corinthians chapter 13. glory to God I hope not those not here who will be looking at what I'm trying to say and glean something from there let's go to First Corinthians chapter 13. um amen Hallelujah it's very familiar amen go to verse 11. because first time they have something big that we'll see how we're going to get into that on Sunday amen verse 11 say when I was a child speak as a and I understood as a and I thought as a is there anything wrong there was nothing wrong if Elijah talked like a child there is nothing wrong if you talk like an adult everybody will raise their eyebrow like wait a minute where did you learn this anybody okay so as long as he's a child what he's doing at that level he's good and there is a level of Tolerance because it's a time sometimes we look we say don't worry about it it's a child she doesn't understand we just tell you stop and we keep moving but when you grow up and you continue to do childish thing that when it doesn't match up and we say either something is wrong or somebody is or something is not going correctly I'm not saying that word wrong but I'm just saying blah so you see what I'm trying to say in other words there is something wrong with the growth of that person because a person who's maybe 25 years old will we expect him to behave a certain way everybody okay so it goes the same with the Revelation because as we grow they're understanding the revelation of a child is different than the revelation of an adult so as we grow in the Lord and the Lord continued to open his word to us are your level of revelation of understanding is now growing so God requires you to behave at the level of your understanding so you cannot look at somebody else and say well they are doing this no when you do that you are blocking yourself because you don't know if that person is predestinated or not you don't know if that person will reach your level or not you don't know if that person would not reach that level until a certain fix that God is still working with it so as the Lord open your path this is an individual walk for the Gentile do not wait on anybody everybody okay so you keep moving with the Revelation so if the Lord open up something to you you cannot sit down or sit back and say no I cannot progress with this you're blocking yourself from the blessing of God Abraham walk alone with God God have to create allow something to happen to separate him from lot so that God can deal with him and individually personally because he was taking the faith of Abraham to a certain level because Abraham will be the father of us all so if he's going to be the father of us or what kind of level he need to go to they need to take him higher so you don't know who you're going to be bringing into this gospel you don't know who you're going to be preaching the message so when God unfolds something to you you go to that level if you understand something when you're listening to the word or maybe there is a new song that came up there everybody's singing that in a message it's a popular song among the young people before you sing it push the brick hey everybody okay stop and look and listen to the word forget about the melody because Pentecostal has specialized in feeling forget about the man or just sit down and say what is all about this song is it about Jesus Christ what kind of Christ what kind of Revelation is coming up if he doesn't cope with the revelation of the hour stop it that is not your food amen anybody okay if we line up with the Revelation in other words you got to filter things through the thinking men's filter when you filter it and you look you say okay this is correct with the Revelation then you can sing it and when you sing it you are singing that with understanding maybe more than the one who sang it but if that person is still under the revelation of Father's son Holy Ghost and he's confused about the deity you're not going to be sitting at home with the knowledge that you have singing Holy Father and then Precious Jesus something is wrong with you you are worshiping God wrong and if that anointing comes I want to work on anointing again because you know better not to do that everybody okay in other words whatever you hear you must have a standard a reference that you're filtering everything through it amen amen amen and then you would know what to reject because the enemy at this time is very very very very very slick amen so continue to pray for our sound system we already installed everything pretty much there is few items that are left but you can see how the devil is fighting us not only the sand system if you go back and you live you look at the sermon you will see sometime the the the streaming the sound is going off and something thinks that we never had a little bit before but it's happening I know it's the death that is doing that sometimes he will block the slide and you can get the code unless I send it to you you lucky praise God you can get it there is somebody online they're screaming for those court and I can reach out to them amen amen so remember what I'm trying to say there is whoever is a part of this church when you come to service stay pray that [Music] did it make sense did it make sense even if you wipe the corner pray make sense so the one who's in the camera is praying because he need to blend with me and me I'm blending with the spirit so we blend together amen and Brother David over there pray that we're blending together so if he's fighting Brother David there your prayer is going to help him out there find what is wrong amen amen amen so it's not just working or playing an instrument or singing no it's a war you don't know how many people get delivered and the devil is not happy amen glory to God Amen I already made up my mind if I have to continue alone I will continue because I know what I'm saying you're going to catch me later in other words I will continue to move forward quickly because I see what's going on at the end you will understand where we were heading amen but I know we're heading toward heaven amen amen glory to God Amen how many understand the mystery of the woman now now you know your wife that she's coming from you you know how to respect your wife she's a byproduct In the Flesh not in the spirit and when she got the Holy Spirit to get more serious again amen amen amen Oh Glory to God I hope the sister would have say Amen louder [Laughter] glory to God everything good you pray for me on Sunday on Saturday we have a question and answer I already pick up the last couple questions there do me a favor I might repeat this again on Sunday when you put a question put your name when you put a question put your name he helped me gauge what I'm looking at if it's an 11 years old who wrote the question I have to look for more detail to open the word so that when I give them the answer I can reach to their level if you don't put the name I will go straight like I'm sorry and then you will you will be completely lost if it's an adult I know that it's an adult I can gauge what to do with the question if you don't put it now I'm relying on the Drone so make my life easy I have the joy I don't have to work with it all the time just put your name there it's so easy put your name on sister so and so I'm brother so and so I'm not going to read your name I just want to see this is an adult this is a married couple this is a brother this is somebody this is a young people if it's a young okay maybe they had a question among themselves one of them is bold enough to come and ask a question which we appreciate so I need to bring more element to make sure when it's coming the young people really get it amen but if you don't want to do it fine with me I will still get it by the Drone but if I get it that way I will come differently so make sure you put your name there it's so easy put your name there amen we in a family put your name dead glory to God amen brother child sent us a flyer here I just receive it today I don't know for some reason there was a delay on either a postal or something but there is a Thanksgiving meeting going on this week it's starting on the 18th which I believe it's uh Friday all the way to Sunday so we will take it and post it right there in case somebody wanna go it's there we just receive it I just received it today but I want to make sure we mention it it will be posted on the billboard there if you can't make it but at least let's pray for the meeting and make sure

answer sleep well stay in prayer we got some material we need to get into a little bit deeper you already got the foundation you understand the mystery of a man you understand the mystery of a woman now we need to really dig into that in Christ so make sure you rest good enough pray because it's a different language that probably you have not heard it before but all will be all right we're gonna travel through the scripture and you will understand the godhead so easily because Paul keeps saying blessed be the father of our Lord Jesus Christ how many is in that how many sent that in the description why so what does he mean yes yes me and my father we are one and here the greatest Apostle who plays the Master Bill that keep coming and say blessed be the Lord God of our father Lord

and we're looking unto you father we give you praise we give you honor and by faith we claim it all done in Jesus name we pray amen and amen hallelujah we won't keep you standing long it's uh let's go to Hebrews 4. or the verse 12 just an honor to be here tonight we're ready to praise the Lord and whip on the devil a little bit huh [Music] God to bring his word to finish him off is that right Hallelujah once you have Hebrews 4 chapter I mean verse 12 Say Amen for the for the word of God is quick and powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword may the Lord add a blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated it says that his Spirit and the sword and able to pierce him even to the dividing as under the Soul and Spirit and the joints in the marrow and it is a discerner of the thoughts and the intents of the heart you know here everyone tonight we had a wonderful time today by the grace of God and uh how about six Souls turn their life over to the Lord you know you know he's doing some great things you know so yeah y'all pray with me I stay in the middle of the road when it started here because of it but this is what was on my heart for here tonight but we've been having a great time by the grace of God you know when you're going to those institutions now you thank God for the ministry that's here and when you thank God for the ministry is here for the end time message for this hour you can go in anywhere you know anytime in any place with boldness is that right because you know you've seen you we're not worrying about the word we're not concerned about the mess what we want to know is just make sure God is with us wherever we go that's what we need to know and if God wants God show you that is when the devil's in trouble somebody's going to get set free somebody's going to be saved somebody's going to get delivered somebody's going to get healed somebody is going to need all they need why because God said the word of God is able to discern his thoughts and intense of a heart so when you go into a place like that and nobody really knows you and God's pricking their heart because he's the only one that's able to go down there and discern the thoughts and the attention of the heart is that right well you want to look at here tonight you know I got the inspiration from um in the message of the end time evangelist you know the end time evangelist there was so much food in there thought of those have listened to that message you know there's no way we're going to get through all that tonight so you pray with me because there's so much that was in there but what was pricking my heart this is what I want to lean to you know I've always when I go in a place I recognize by God's grace and mercy that our battle is salvation versus religion but you know we want to look at tonight the True Stone Nation versus the religious Stone Mason okay when we get friends going through the message you'll see what brother Brandon was working with in that thought it's a true Stone Mason versus the religious Stone Mason you know all of them is building they're building out there but he was saying you know in every age when he started off in that thought he was talking about the messengers for every age and he said into his dinner and you know the first age was the even age is that right and in that age we know God was the messenger to Adam and Eve then so God being the messenger to Adam and Eve they got us straight from the Throne of God is that right that's why we know what God has given us is from the strength from the Throne of God when you're coming from Straight From The Throne of God you come in expecting is that right whatever you're needing you'll come expecting and you know he will meet your need so we're here we want to look at it and just kind of paraphrase it until we get to our point when brother Brandon was working that there the end time evangelist so we don't have to unusual then you'll see why your pastor is being anointed by the Holy Spirit to minister what he's ministering in this end time you know because you were building something God's Building something God's moving us somewhere we know that time is winding up is that right time is closer than it's ever been you know the last time I was here I was telling you that that we know that the pope is running the show we know we got seven out of nine of our Supreme Court Justices Catholics we know that by him is Catholic we know the Nancy's Catholic now they're over there now and they're getting ready to change the Ten Commandments the meaning over there in Egypt and so you have to understand on the same Mountain where Moses was that's where they're meeting at and then I think the last day is on the 18th so what they're bringing in is one world religion so that's why we're sharing with you that's why you'll see you're getting the word don't be complaining about you know I heard brother Brandon said a person that don't have the Holy Ghost they can't sit up in the house of the Lord for 15 minutes he said that somebody that got the Holy Ghost they can sit there for day and night and listen to the world you say they recognize the presence of the of the Lord they recognize the time that they're living in they recognize that God only divine revelation is here this is not now God has given you Revelation about what that picture is that right God is that right we understand it's the man of God but it's God that chose him to be in that picture that means god is identifying him that he's Malachi for Luke 17 30. Revelations 10 7 He's My Messenger that I'm sending for laodicea hello Hallelujah it's a war going on a religious War he said many come in my name when we're in that institution you fighting them religious demons you better know your Bible and the only thing they can't touch because they don't have a message at the hour and when that religious demon you're coming in you let them know playing in simple that I didn't come in here for that I didn't come in here preaching the same gospel I come in here with a message from the almighty God I'm looking for that last seed I'm ready to go home it's a rejoicing time I see the time is there some might be in the hospital he said when I was sick you visited me when I was hungry you fed me when I need cold you clothing me when I was in jail with prison you visited me so I know he's not sending me in there his work is not invading them so we coming in we bring in the word of God we let them know quickly our mission my mission is to get you ready to meet him in the air religion versus salvation it's a real war the only reason things which you bear bear with me I know his son I mean I know it's uh Wednesday got a timer but just bear with me the next messenger the property God was talking about was Noah and when Noah came on she didn't know I had a Time he's in a very scientific time yes yes but he was the messenger that was sent for that age and he was the message that was sent for that age the messenger always come at the end of the day and so when you come at that end of the age God give him a thus say the Lord and it does say to the Lord he had to bring you what Minister that Ark his message was to do what build that Ark he had to build that Ark he preached that gospel to him and when he preached that gossip he had to be mocked was there Same Spirit that was dead people die but Spirits don't die and when they got over there and they come into the Scarface was dead but then finally it got to a point it was time for another dispensational change and when the dispensational change had to come nobody wasn't Noah at that time now it was time to go into the ark if you're going there and read it brother Brandon said now Noah had to be tried his faith had to be tested he had to trust in the same word that he was preaching all right he had to touch the same thing and so now it's coming down to our time but we got around in there when Noah got there I'm sure he took what a lot of stack for maybe his children at the time because he said when God told him to go in there after the first day it didn't well it didn't rain ah it hadn't rained yet though but he know he had a promise from God if God said it I believe it that's it hold on [Music] so we're talking about now religion versus salvation nowhere in that time when he went in that Ark does it say in the Bible and that the devil was there looking down in that hole no but brother Brandon said the devil was right in the hole Yeah every day let me see if I can't find it for you help me Lord said he was right there and he said he was right there because why he's no good I got no use for him Hallelujah in time evangelism he said now look he said he stood he said and the scoffers this is end time evangelism I don't have the luxury of the board so I'll have to call it huh it's paragraph 89 89 and 90. he said now here was the type of his the Noah a tight now of his dispensational a trial as they had a trial because God told him to go into the ark he had to go by faith he said that when he went to the ark the doors shut itself and Noah no doubt told his family watch tomorrow he said on your clothes tonight he said but in the morning who there would be rain up there in the sky never had been there before he said then the scoffers did what and made some of them kind of halfway Believers let's go up and let's go up and stand see some of the scoffers came in here thinking this ministry was going to fall down but they don't know who called you they don't know who hit you they don't know what it is uh huh I'm telling you we got to bring it up we can't leave it back on that day people die Spirits don't die we're talking about religious demons we're gonna get to we gonna get to the message of the hour bear with me Hallelujah he said now look watch he said to bring the rain he said now let's go up and stand he said you know that old man could have been right he said they stood around New York waiting you know and thought well he could be right and they went up and the next morning and they Rose just adjusting pretty good you know what it is Pastor they looking every day they looking on there you know he could be right uh will we get 1 000 1400 viewers you see one thousand people in here oh huh they don't want to be identified huh they want to be identified with the message of the hour they want to be identified last time we was here I'm not knocking Hebrew definition I'm not knocking Arabic definition but what did he say he said what he said the information is not Revelation information can lead you to Revelation because you got to know him what did he say he went over to this brother told Brother Charles you say this this you say that to them well he said he knew what he said to brother Charles he said but then when he went over there and whispered to him is that right he didn't know what he said to brother Charles why because you got to go to Christ you got to get to know him yourself you got to be communal with him [Applause] foreign they went up and the next morning the sun rose as a pretty across he said you know no doubt that's the point I went there to catch no doubt but what Satan set up there on the top of that hole in the ark that's how Rodney is come on now you healed you're getting a little pain he come around right and tell you you ain't healed huh you don't pray to ask God for your blessing first thing he come and tell you you're not going to receive your blessing huh he kept telling you you don't pray and put your child or your loved ones under the altar he keep bringing you worse situations to you when it's good evil is always present but greater is he that is in me than he that is in the world we're an awards okay huh we got the victory all we doing is waiting to go home is that right huh it's already paid for you shouldn't be sad you shouldn't be crying you shouldn't be moping all we doing is waiting to go home the prophecy is being fulfilled right in front of our eyes go in there pull it up there oh Paul be sitting around in there all them religious leaders come by the pope go pull it up some of you don't have it I'll send it to you they're sitting there they know what they're doing they're trying to tell them it's Global uh uh Global uh era or they want the global to watch over the global atmosphere hmm lying out of the pitch of hell now they're moving into one world religion we know what it's we know what it's doing let me keep going help me Lord he said you think you're still right well that's the way the devil does all of us but as long as God said so stay with it huh that don't matter what what they say right stay right with it huh no we got around near Noah we thank the Lord for no but we know Noah message can't save us so we get around there right who's the next one we got Moses is that right he talked about Moses and Moses down there Moses he was giving the message he had to bring to deliver to bring him up out of Egypt but Moses mission was to what it was the laws that right Moses was given the law when you go over there brother Brown said that's the worst thing they did they rejected the aggression took the law that's what held Israel up we got to understand now this is not legalistic this is not capitalistic why because God showed us the way out is that life God's brought a word by The Throne of God from divine revelation so when you go out there now that on these religious demons and they try to come with you with that calvinist when they come into your wedding Luther's time it went too far to the left is that right the faith of whether the just to live by faith is that right yeah but they was making God's face God's grace of Faith a disgrace that's exactly what they were doing and saying they reserve the message of the hour and you're living that kind of life is that right then they came Wesley when they came to Wesley he got away they were armenius is that right they went too far to the right but God rich in Mercy came and brought us a word and showed us how to rightfully divide the word of grace to the people so those that were struggling those with the religious demons he even told your parents when they sat upon it as certain Ministries that they didn't mean no harm they was falling away that was all offered to them at that time but the hand of Grace has now been extended to you why because the truth is that right the truth that they're made known to us and it's our here now only thing that set you freeze the truth is that right we got the truth we got the True Stone Mason is that right Moses Moses had to come with the law and the law wasn't going to get him out of it either is that right and then after Moses who came after Moses he's talking about John is that right John had to introduce John had to come and introduce Christ is that right you constantly help me Lord he said now look paragraph 1997 out of the same message he says then he says then after Moses come John he says and after John the dispensation come see the dispensation of change is that right he said now he says and then at the Moses he says then when Jesus come to try to bring us Grace which was God in the spirit in the line of spirit manifested his love for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son and Jesus was so different and contrary to the what law that right but it was a different dispensation so what do you have to understand in his time here now God is bringing us a word a word of Grace if you don't see the grace in this message you can't you can't look at yourself we're going to get to those stones in a minute and we're going to show you why the holy spirit is chipping away is that right let's look at what the definition what excuse me what that stone is it said a stonemason a person who cuts prepares and builds with stones okay what is he building we'll show you what he's building when I keep reading he said now you look he says in his timing now they've always had that religion we're talking about God was the first messenger Noah was the next messenger Moses was the next message John brought the next message Jesus came with Grace now we turn around here you got to understand someone always wants to lean to their own understanding right is that right at the end of the Louisiana time after the flood here come who Nimrod is that right Nimrod coming in nevermind God has an order they're saying that we was going to do what build the Tower the Bible is next time if the flood come we'll make a way out all right God already told me what I'm going to do bring a flood next time you see how people lean to their own understanding excuse me people coming in here instead of following the message of the hour instead of following the way you know they run here they run there you know what they try to find a system and that fit with the how they want to worship they want to live what they want to work that's a religious demon you got nothing but a religious demon on you and you need to ask God to help you because when God is bringing you Grace when God is bringing you Grace to mold you and shape you into into his character what we're looking at now after when Jesus came when Jesus came to was totally then misunderstood why because when he preached that Beatitudes is that right when he went up there to the mountains the Bible said his disciples his disciples came and they sat down among him and when they sat there with him they said he preached he taught them is that right he taught them a new dispensational change was coming now in the dispensational change is coming love your enemy he'll go through them that that despise you pray for them that those that do wrong for you that's what he was telling us to do not gossip not beat him down not not cut them off he said lie he said blessed is the pure at heart for they shall what see God now come on amen dispensational change we're talking about the word we're talking about the resurrected word we're talking about in this hour here now you're being molded and you're being shaped and what let me keep going help me Lord he's saying now look he was giving instructions he said now at that time after that dispensation of change and then brother Brandon was talking about it he was saying now let's look at the real end time evangelism what an evangelism really is doing in the end time for his pride for his people help me Lord look let's turn the Psalms I tell you first psalm 127. Hallelujah we're looking at here if God if God can't do it then it won't be done can't do it it won't be done see why the pastor you see who you'll see why something just got the knowledge of the picture some just got the knowledge of the picture some just had the knowledge of the picture but we'll see what God is building what he's showing us these things amen he said now you look Psalms 127 he says he said now what he said except who the Lord build the house he said they laboring what and they that build it except the Lord keep the what city The Watchman walk is what in vain so if God is doing this here it's God when he says the boss told me to go this way and the boss told me to go that way he'd been warning you and telling you you're in the war is that right he said the plane maneuver this way the flame maneuver that way is that right so what they're going to do he's going to come and he's going to attack in all areas now because he's trying to keep up with us he's trying to keep up with what the holy spirit is leading the head with so he's trying to attack the shepherd but he can't attack the shepherd because the holy spirit is leading them is that right he's leading and guiding Us in all truth he said the footsteps of the righteous is ordered of the Lord so with God unless God building that house is going to be built in vain they're not going to be mountains to anything he said who do some say that I am when he got there is that right bill building the church he said who do men say that I am some say you Elijah some say you Jeremiah some say you wanted a prophets some say you John the Baptist he said who did I say that I am thou are what the Christ you are the Christ the son of the Living God he said Peter Flesh and Blood this has not been revealed to you if somebody come ask you in that religious war and they try to come and give you a Trinity there's no such thing as a trinity just three offices there's the Father the Son the holy spirit is three title officers is that right this is one of the religious demons you're going to face son I face it all the time so you got to understand first John seven and five you got to bring them to that take them to the word is that right the word of God is sharper than in a two-edged sword when you take them to the word of God then in first John 5 and 7 he said the word the Father the spirit is what one is that right that's why you get around in it he said the blood and the water and the spirit is what agreeing one is that right that's why when the Holy Spirit now has given us a true Revelation a true Revelation so you don't have to to just agree in one the Lord told us you could be justified is that right and not Sanctified he even told the Lord not the fact the Lord told you look to examine yourself when he said to see if you truly Justified if you've got the revelation of justification justification get away with the law is that right now it came with Grace but the justification that they the way they were preaching it through the message it was nothing different than denominations is that right now God gave us the Revelation it took away all of our offenses in all of our officials was taken away that's why the prophet that God can say you never done it [Applause] what you afraid to be afraid God didn't give us the spirit of fear but love peace joy and a sound mind [Applause] God say you're healed you're healed your conditions had nothing to do with your feelings stick with the word of God [Applause] justify we've been justified by the Justified he told us the reason why you don't understand him because you never cut the revelation of the Brazen altar yeah you never caught the Revelation if you catch the revelation of the Brazen altar then you're recognized and that Brazen altar all you see is the cross all you see is the sacrifice huh all you see is The Blood Brother the blood all the blood the blood don't sign my name huh at the cross at the cross where I first saw the light and the burdens of my heart rolled away it was dead by faith I received my sight now I'm happy all today huh [Applause] in the Old Testament he got around in and light up it says you're you're mean what light is that right huh throwing me Perfection is that right and urine is the first letter of the Hebrew right and Thurman is the last letter of the Hebrew alphabet Jesus Christ the same the first and the last ah twice back on the scene again in times past God spoke through the prophets of God is that right he spoke to them now and this times all this time God himself now speak through Jesus Christ yeah the prophet is that right now God himself becomes the prophet is that right foreign [Applause] speak it and heaven will back you up [Applause] [Music] come on bride that this message increase that prayer life get them demons keep them demon forces off the ministry is that right huh if God don't build the house it can't be built is that right he said now you got to know the times you're living it you got to understand that all these religious demons that says love is a pleasure let's turn that first Timothy help me Lord First Timothy 3 I believe it is I got to catch it while you bring it thank you Jesus amen be over there at uh oh yeah second Timothy three help me Lord be sitting down look it's how we're here now that's why you hear the past he said we're in a war we wrestling not against flesh and blood we're wrestling against principalities power and wickedness and rulers in high places when you start playing praying you hit those demons huh you deeming a migraine you demon a worry action you demon and lust you demon of pornography you demon of drinking you demon of smoking you hit those demons your son is out of here now huh you

and if you come up here and not fulfilling what God sent you to do the devil's going to zoom in on you [Applause] [Music] think this is something to play with you keep playing with that devil he's looking and watching waiting for you to slip up [Music] thank you he said a decision brother Brandon said a decision is like it's Stone it's a confession huh that's why we're talking about the True Stone is that right when they came up against Jesus what's the first thing the devil said why don't you turn these these Stones underwear Brad why are you trying to Jesus wasn't going to confess nothing with that devil huh what are you talking about huh I'm the word you come challenge in the world you got the word in this hour here now we got the word is that right we got all Heaven back in us what did he look at him say it is written man should not live by bread alone but by every word believe every word of God why because Jesus why Jesus took care of all of our buildings is that right we owe the debt that we could not pay [Applause] he paid the debt that he could not up that he did not know he could not send one word couldn't come do it for us by the Sea huh he couldn't sing Gabriel Gabriel couldn't do it for us God said no no no no no no no talking about Shadrach Meshach and the Bendigo he was down in there they knew who they were they purposed in their heart they wasn't going to defile themselves put the King to me no matter how good it looked then why because it got a revelation he's right lust an eye Less in the flesh pride of life brother Robert that's how he's going to come at you you just got to gain those areas you got to understand the times that you're living in you know Chi-Raq Meshach and the Bendigo they knew who they were you know who you are you're the Bride of Jesus Christ you a daughter of the most high God no man speak to you the wrong way [Applause] demand respect it's the hour that we're living in wow you gotta we got a word we're gonna

that right we're going to show you nobody can't take your position I'm gonna show you in a minute you better catch a revelation they need to get born again they got to get born again another word in another spirit is that right we're talking about still at that Brazen altar Chiraq Meshach and Abednego they knew who they were they good in there at that time when they know they knew they wasn't going to bow down right to the king's image even though if it was Daniel's image it wasn't going to bow down to it see they don't know some people is taking it down you know why they don't have a revelation [Applause] the message and the messenger is what one should I write me shotgun and Bendigo wasn't going to bow down to it huh no they wasn't they didn't care that you put them in the fiery furnace they say heat it up huh heat it up what seven times is that right heated up hotter is that right but God for Richard Mercy ah one worms said I'll send a flood on them let me go down there he said no I can't let you go away so let me go he said no Gabriel I can't let you go huh I can't let you go he said but they get ready to go in the fire and you look down in here he said yeah I see them praying all night foreign [Applause] trying to get you to pray you're still having grace and mercy on you why because he said that's when less demons are moving around he's trying to give you an opportunity to break through huh you're running around in your flesh you weren't at that flesh you got to get around at a certain time huh if you just knew his schedule if you knew he's got you don't have to say it I'll say it I'll be catching some of your thoughts out there sometimes thinking of using itself as an example no no no no no no no no calculate the hours calculate the hours in the time of the day and you tell me if a normal man could do that no no no no no no no it's the Holy Ghost [Applause] God said I gotta come myself that's my bride that's my bride I gotta go down there and get him myself is that right he's sitting down in the Holy Ghost for God is a what a spirit he said I thought I put three in there but I seen four come out of the fire ah stop being afraid of the supernatural [Applause] [Music] our God is a supernatural a super Supernatural God Moses met in Supernatural Paul met him Supernatural huh brother Brandon met him Supernatural then you made him supernaturally huh we serve a supernatural God and it's already in you he want to use you huh he's inside of you know anybody that I tell you what turn to turn to acts 20. help me Lord we're gonna turn back to Timothy show you these demons that you're fighting against turn to Acts 20. I tell you Acts 20. and verse 27 once you have it say Amen then not the Lord tell us that we got more than what any of those other measures you'll look for they're not the Bible say brother Steve they desire to see the things that we see and you're taking it lightly you've taken this really lightly when God himself come down broke those seals huh let me show you there's no sales come in there you got to understand what that cloud what it did for us is that right why are they always attacking the cloud I don't know come on huh when even Washington identified it even the biggest critic identified it even the biggest critic identified that light 1950 Houston Texas in the Gulf Auditorium is that right and God look you take a picture only God can allow himself to be taken in the war some of them you go in there and you're living and then you feel that you know what they think they sit in there and say what you're preaching and they just sitting here preachers too oh brother I'm watching my brother told me years ago I'm watching the words I started saying bro you need to stop it like we used to tell them anyway stop it stop it stop it because you know it ain't making sense what you're saying yeah how are you going to sit there if you get around in there and the Holy Ghost Fire is there and when that word comes huh it's going to show some emotions [Applause] some come in there preaching they come up here preaching and they think they can come through this door huh but for the past and brother Robert testify before they went in there the door swung open and the Holy Ghost came in that door internationally the Holy Ghost is running this church [Applause] supernaturally [Music] you can't do that and they sit there and they won't say nothing they stand back there you're preaching let me get around there then all of a sudden you come in what did he tell them you ain't got to touch them Shields [Music] you're in the wrong place you're in the wrong place with that foolishness huh somewhere you let the devil influence you how can you miss those those ages ain't no seals when the seals when when the winter seals had the Thunders hidden underneath of it is that right and when the seventh seal came you got to understand when they go over there it was the son of man relating it to a son of man he was going up the ladder right John 151 tells you that that it was Christ coming down opening those seals and now it is Christ now back on the scene why you had every age messenger you had Paul you had Iranians you had Saint Martin you had Columbus you had Luther you had Wesley and then when you came down to what happened and then they had a Suzuki street is that right the Pentecostal but then he had to come by to the Covenant angel of Revelations 10 1 7. then Revelation 19 Luke 17 30 that scripture had to be fulfilled Malachi oh before the Drayton great and Dreadful coming day of the Lord I will send you what Elijah the prophet it had to come five times is that right had to come Elijah had to come Elisha had to come John the Baptist had to come William Branham and it got to come again Elijah and Moses himself come on now we got Bible to back it up you don't have to be afraid of nothing [Applause] okay what are we doing in this hour here quick paying attention is overweight we move forward if God is winning moving he's moving us into something he's moving us into what the supernatural Acts 20 to 7. let me show you who came down and died for you [Music] huh let's see who come down for you Acts 20 27 for I have not shown to what to declare unto you what all the Council of God [Music] Paul all his counsel was only parked ah so now when he said you got to understand now what we had the Bible said when that that the fullness has come that that is in part has done away ah the angel from Paul came to brother Brandon the angel from Iranians come to brother Brandon the angel from Saint Martin came to brother Brandon the angel who from Luke came to brother Banner the angel from Wesley came to brother Brandon the angel from Pentecost came to brother Brandon yes come on give you a bonus peace the word that's why I said the last time I was here he said cry out he told Jonah go cry out that's why when they try to preach him that he was in it he was out of the will of God no you had a Vindicated Prophet with the foreigners to come and tell us donor was not out of the will of God Jonah was a type of the resurrected Christ exactly right I'm talking about keep preaching past that he beat me no I can have some in the storehouse when I go and fight them demons you know when you're going to institution he said many shall come in my name he said every religion they got to let in the institution including a witch a witches is because it's considered what uh uh religion man yeah is that right I'm looking someone's bringing that source to me you bring that sorcery around if you want to huh God's training you it was a message I wanted if we but God didn't let me preach that tonight I'm sure what God's training you and his training is taking to every level he's bringing it to the level he bringing you to a level he's getting you ready for this showdown he's getting you ready for it and the ones that's falling away it got to be first of falling away and that way you say falling away from work from this message away from Christ they did they come the bride let me show you he says why sure not to declare unto you all the Council of who that's right brother Sam he says take heed therefore unto yourself and to all the flock over that which the what Holy Ghost have made you up excuse me sir did you put yourself here because you know why if you did I was going to tell you the Bible didn't say that who put you there [Applause] [Music] oh I'm having a good time I love whipping on the devil especially them religious devils buying up God's people huh he said look and then the holy the Holy Ghost vindicates it you understand he's the only one confinicated divine revelation no man can you divine know me look what we said that's right brother Sam he said oh to the flock over that wish to what Holy Ghost have made you oversee it to feed what uh who are you ah give him a clap all friend do to call that once foreign which he had purchased with what now who purchased see that's why he could not send woodworm he could not sing Gabriel at all he could not send them for us but we were in our sinful life but God had to come himself because God purchased us with his blood his unadulterated blood God's the only one really you're a seed of God you belong to God you come from God uh no religion can go back far as us he said job where were you and our lady of foundation ah I was in where at in the mind of God that's my origin I was in the mind of God before the foundation of the world [Music] thank you Lord with his own blood look the demons you fighting turn back to uh Ephesians I'm sorry second uh Timothy Hallelujah II Timothy 3. look at these demons you fight he said now familiar scripture he said now natural he said now and what this this note also that in the last days perilous times shall come right for me shall be lovers of their own self all these demons and things you're looking out for you see if they're not leading the Christ are they selfish they have the money or something where they going to go if you leave this message you're going in the wilderness or you're trying to go back to Pentecost that's why the Lord told us Pentecost is not the Pentecost that they're talking about in the upper room is that right he said that was the Pentecost that was on hisuzu street they typed that with restoration of the gifts brother Brown we're not throwing away the gifts they're in you they're in you already but God got to train you God got to build you up God got to teach you God got to build a character in you God got to strengthen you to handle this good and to handle that remember he got over there you got to just keep your eyes on the pride you wait on God and nothing is not a mess everything is in the order according to the Lord okay so you have to realize what God's doing to you so our own our biggest problem is who yourself you're battling yourself is that right you can't get about that flesh you gotta understand ask God to take away that complex eggs is that right take it away I seen Supernatural things happen with people you got to trust in the Lord and lean not to your own understanding acknowledge Him in all thy ways and he will lead and he will guide you the Lord will unless the Lord build the house unless the Lord build that house unless the Lord build the house it's going to be building Vain and what kind of house it's a spiritual house Blasphemous Disobedience to parents unthankful Unholy without natural affection truth Bakers false accusers incontinent what they say drop down to verse five having a what religious that's exactly right brother Sam that's exactly right the truth Stone Mason versus the religious Stone Nation it's going to be so close we're gonna say brother Robert when he took that picture we got the picture right up there what was happening up there it was the true word the pure word the unadulterated word was talking to the religious man is that right he was talking to the religious man and the religious man rejected the way of Salvation is that right he says having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof for such what turn away for this short are they which creeping to end how the lead captive silly women laying with sins LED away with what diver's lust oh that's different than why the diverse difference lust is because you gotta understand the Satan tempt you and you yield to it then say no how he can work you you understand you're getting around in there you got the Bible say first do what submit yourself to the word of God and then the devil will flee from you fun we're getting the word God's preparing you for this battle quit playing Church some of you ripping and running around around there where you go where you going where are you going you're going if God tell you to go then you go God ain't telling you to go you're going to get in trouble soon in there later yeah stop the religion help me Lord you said not to learn he says in doing what ever what and never able to come into the what then you resist the baptism of the Holy Ghost you resist the baptism of the Holy Ghost Judas come all the way up until he showed his colors when it was time to go to Pentecost is that right when it was time to accept the baptism of the Holy Ghost they rejected it is that right amen now he's bringing you now that's why you think it's the right thing huh it's stirring up it's stirring up the folks in the message with it brother I could take two questions and answers 1954 then I could take you over to the seals over there in 63. brother Brandon said if a person's oil ran out in that first oil when it ran out he said they didn't have the Holy Ghost how could you have the Holy Ghost if your oil ran out foreign could the Bible said we all slept in slumber the seals had to come the Thunders had to come the Mysteries had to come that's your second oil that's your refilling [Music] [Applause] sitting up in there huh not this church brother come around and say this church Rejoice over the words huh you would you don't be restored back to your first love you have been restored back to your first love I had no fault with My bride is that right he said look now we know it was James and Jerry that's another lesson let's go let me read these quotes a scripture looking at that cloud helpeth Lord and that's why I said you pray for you pray for him who we got end time evangelists uh let's say start paragraph 189 at 6 3 62. he says is that truth now decision is join the church you leave the Methodist this one go read the messages join up with the Baptist or you leave the Baptist and you join up join us the Methodist Presbyterian Lutheran Catholic all leave one message Church go to another message Church leave one message Church to go to another message Church leave one message Church to go to another message Church ain't nothing but a religious demon let me get around and tell you if God ain't sending you there he's just battling a religious demon okay you need to get settled in your spirit your spirit's not settled that's why the Lord was bringing us about that Tabernacle every time you've seen me flesh that Tabernacle why because that was the master plan of the Plan of Redemption Moses saw the Plan of Redemption the Lord who rich in Mercy he showed you the entrance of that door that door is Christ son and then after you come to Christ so then you go to the what the Brazen Altar and then after you go to praise and altar how do you go to the praise and altar a Godless sorrow bring a Godly repentance that you don't have to repent to know more and after you go to that Brazen altar now why because you've seen a word a word LED you there where'd it say Brother Sam you're being led by what faith is that right the faith of God is leading you through that then after you leave there to tell you once you see it you got to repent be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for every mission of the sins you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost then you move into what the labor is that right you got to go to the labor and get a white stuff you've been Justified you've been Sanctified and he said you're getting the holy place what did he type the holy place we type the holy place for being free more will is that right now one of those Avenues the devil will attack you is either a memory imagination conscience and affection one of those things the devil attack you in you got the god that wise that's why so many of them got themselves in the jam because they were taught just receiving the word no sensation well you gotta understand now and God God has brought what the opening of the seals and bring us to thunder you can't move into the thunder until you receive what the word from the seals is that right we're going to show you bear with me help me Lord Lord he said look we're gonna do some jumping now paragraph 190 same message he says what God is what what good is the stones if you haven't got it what stonemason ah what good is it if the Holy Ghost ain't leading your church he said he's dead now he said now look confession is Stones he said when Peter made his confession Jesus said thou are were Peter the little Stone but what good is the stone if there is in a stone Nation he said there to shape him into a what a Son of God you're just piling up a bunch of what what Stones you're starting up a bunch of rocks he says in that and that he said is that right it isn't doing a bit of good the water where's the way the stones he said what good is Stones if you hadn't if you haven't got a what True Stone Mason huh we moving somewhere now bear with me just want to ask you what's good what's good the decision CJ let me stop there see that's the demon that are fighting the institutions because what they do they say oh we accept Jesus Christ as a person who save you you get around here we got these decisions about your head raise your hand oh we gotta go we gotta go to the meetings with them when I go to the meetings with them we got this many decisions we got this many decisions got this many decisions okay then here we come my time to go to that cell block when we get it around in there telling you accept Jesus Christ as your personal savior but you're not a Christian yet you're a potential Christian now they start moving it oh now the seed is thrown in there once the seed is thrown in there now you're saying that somebody's asking what's my next step is that right now you just totally welcome with justification that's all you're working with when you're working in brother brown with Billy you said Billy Graham sat at the table with him they was in a meeting he said he got over there he said Billy Graham said I go to the meeting I got 30 000 Converse he said to come back he can't find another one 10 20 whatever he said he said when he come back brother Branham said he sat there he said I was just a little squirt then he said he said Adam lazy preachers you got the foot up on the desk and sitting there he said well one day it's building what about Paul ah he said Paul gotta convert he come back he got about 30 of them he said why he said because he stayed and worked with him he worked with him he brought them into it is that right Paul said have you received the Holy Ghost since you believe is that what he said Paul didn't de-christianize him but you then moving on into what into the Tabernacle is that right hallelujah we're talking about moving what into the Holiness of holy and staying there huh you're going to have trials but we got a word he said to him it shall not possess the Gate of the enemy he gave Peter the keys the devil is going to always keep coming against you but we all got to be tried and tested we Stones we got to be molded and shaped in there but we gotta understand is that right God for rich in Mercy he promised us is that right tribulation worketh what patient patient working what experience experience versus hope the experience is built in your what character is there with me we get me he said now look help me Lord he said now look he said the truth he said the good decision and that's what I was saying I was working with decisions you got to fight that thing that's a religious that's part of religious demons they get around there then they get them into the church and it's supposed to be the spiritual hospital and you get them in that spiritual hospital and then you tell them they're all right you put them on the choir they put them on the instrument you got around there you make him a trustee you put it on something it ain't even saved yet huh not even saved he said now look put in your name on the book let me straight on down here help me Lord he said look he said look he says this is what brother Brandon's quoting here at paragraph 190. he said if the stone Nation isn't there that'll shake that and make them quit this and that and cut them and make them over this way and square them up and make them like what Christians not message people Christians that's what they hit around hit behind huh folk this quote that quote this quote that quote this quote that huh huh get around that religion behind because I got the message huh that's right what is it to be a Christian to be a Christian is to be identified with Christ and to be identified with Christ you've got to be walking in the message of your hour the message of your day all right and he's going and it's building something now you see why now you see why you're getting that Holiness of holy just bear with me help me Lord he said to make he said you make them what Christians he said now he said that he said with Christians that set in the house of God with signs following the Believers he said that's in time evangelism taking the stones and shaping them he said doing what ah amen you know why they keep coming in there with these heels on you think it's a man don't you it is not look at your garments that they wear right think it's a man don't you that's why they keep doing it you thought it was a man that tell you to stop bossing your husband stopped mistreating your wife husband God commissioned you to love your eyes sisters God commissioned you to but to let the bill be to be submissive to your husband is that right if you're not doing something right when you get in your prayer closet what about Hannah huh what about the unjudged judge the woman that came to the unjust judge how she used her Authority she prayed she prayed the Holy Ghost set up his son and he said you don't have to try to do it you just go to him he'll straighten that head out he'll do it huh how come he told how come he told the men that's the how come last time when I was here somebody got kicked kicked up uh in your spirit when I was telling them that what your jelly back then is that right hey that brother Kelly no he didn't the Holy Ghost came right back and brought it the way through the pasta oh he's supposed to do he said if you letting your wife do that you pervert it and he said if the wife is out of that position she's perverted we just reminded now you see why the Lord got to do what chip on the stone yes he gotta chip the stone the stone Mason got a chip on the stones he gotta get you right back before you meet them huh huh we'll show you what Ellie we'll show you what Ellie is huh he said now after that that's right brother he said what good the stones be is just pile up let them lay there if the pastor let you come in any kind of way if he knows he's in there struggling if you don't blame her in prayer he's not him he said this is what the boss gave me amen because the boss sent you to him the property God said God sets the audience he got us into five-fold Ministry to chip off you need to send it for this way that way he said look you better they might need some help me Lord they might need a little better out there than they pile up he said they might be needed out there and none of them out there see that's right stone is no good without a stone Mason he said Jesus counts what character [Music] Jesus counts character not members not that he counts character God has always tried to get one man in his hand that he needs is one man his work through the years just think he could only find one righteous man and know his time in Moses time he got over there God is looking for character let me read this turn and we're going to stop turn the turn to Exodus um God help me 33. it was Moses standing in the gap but Moses got to get Moses had to get a confirmation from God and after got his confirmation there from God you look at Moses here and see God help me yeah 33. you go to death in 33 where it is that's okay for the sake of time let's go to 34. 34. I mean let's look at 33 verse 18. Exodus 33 verse 18. and he said he said I deceased these show me thy Glory and he said I will make all my goodness pass before thee and I will what Proclaim my what proclaim the name of the Lord he says the name of the Lord before thee and will be what gracious to whom I will be gracious and will be show Mercy through whom I will show mercy and he said those can cannot see my face for there shall no man see see me and live he said and the Lord said unto thee and just give me five minutes and we'll stop he says and see my face and live and the Lord said behold there is a place by me and now it shall stand upon they what or the rock we know which is Christ and it shall come to pass while my glory passes by that I will put thee in a cleft of The Rock he says and we'll cover thee with my hand while I pass by he said now look let's drop down here in verse 34 for the sake of time he said now verse 5. now he gets his new vision from God if you go back and read in Moses prayer over there in 33 Moses went to God Moses got his grace from God Moses knew he was he was in the hand of God and when Moses got in the hand of God Moses never stopped moving in his position Moses moved in this position and he stood in the gap for who for God's people is that right Moses stood in the gas that's what your Shepherd did he stands in the gap for many days many nights sometimes you don't understand it but it'd be Supernatural God strengthened his body to keep going what he needed to do because he realizes God called you if God called you God chose you God appoints you God will anoint you right so we're going in there look what he said he said and the Lord descended into what ah I don't have the market but I can move the boy ah look what those Thunders look what was under those seals look what those Thunders is getting we're supposed to produce let me keep going he says in the Lord descended in the cloud and stood with him there and proclaimed the what the name of the Lord and the Lord passed by before him and proclaimed the Lord the Lord God look at this characteristic I like ignore God merciful yes gracious long-suffering and abundant in goodness and Truth keeping Mercy for thousands for giving iniquity transgression and sin and that will by no means clear the guilty visiting the iniquity of the father upon the children upon the children's children unto the third and to the fourth generation and what do they do we're talking about when that cloud came down when that seals came open doing even in there with brother Brandon said what he said Thunders is what a thunder is a lived life in the face of the devil he said so how are you going to get it it's the character he's trying to bring you into the Holiness of holy you can come on up musicians they're trying to bring you into the Holiness of holy so we can build that character inside of you Hallelujah let us let us bow Lord God we come before you Lord Jesus asking you Lord God to forgive me of anything that I said Lord God to discourage your children Lord Jesus we were only Lord God following your leadership Lord God and want to encourage your precious children Lord Jesus strengthen them and lead them and guide them Father and Lord Jesus we recognize that you are here continue to bless the pastor his family the deacons the Saints the gifted ones Lord God and those that are streaming Lord God far and off internationally Lord God bless them also Lord Jesus we thank them all for their support but father they recognize it's not a man they know that is you leading the man so father we thank you Lord God and Lord God as we look out among your children we ask them anyone just raise your hand if you Desiring the Holy Ghost if you desire in prayer God bless you God bless you God bless you God bless you my hands up always need a refilling I need a refilling Lord Lord God you see the hands father we thank you for all that you do Lord Jesus you know Lord God that you touch the hearts the mind and the souls Lord God you know what each and every one of us needed on tonight Lord Jesus so we thank you Lord God we give you praise we give you honor we give you glory grain of traveling Mercy Lord God on the way home Lord Jesus so we thank you in Jesus name we pray amen and amen birth Steve let's give him a clap off [Applause] praise God let's give them a clap offering again glory to God amen amen and amen and amen amen hallelujah amen the True Stone Mason versus a religious one amen Glory Glory Glory to God I'm going to finish my scripture again the Bible says when I was a child I speak as a child I understood as a child I thought as a child but why when I became a man I put away childish things amen Deliverance is not a big problem the Deliverance of God is usually very simple but we are brought up with a Pentecostal ways where we need to work we need to fast 10 days we need to watch and we need to do this we need to do this and then when you come up from there you're feeling like you did something to earn what you were asking God for you like I did this I did this that's why I got the result amen amen God is not complicated no one time Israel sin and when Israel sinned they did something that was pretty bad and Moses intervened before God and God told him go ahead and make the Brazen serpent and he put it there did they tell the Israel too fast they taught Israel to pray they told Israel to go to church all of these things are good they just taught Israel at that time just look amen don't do anything else just look what is the problem with looking amen a mother of life and death amen was laying on the look if you don't want to look you die if you look you are healed and you are saved what is complicated there is nothing too big for the Lord amen when God unfolded nobody knew there was a power in the present servant until God opened that Revelation he was a new revelation that was not there yet God opened it and he unfolded and when he unfolded there was life right there you jump quickly right there you get your healing and you keep moving it's like the pool of Bethesda when the angel move on just jump right there you get your healing and you move on when you get healed from what was stopping you on the pull of Bethesda you're not gonna come back again you need now to go back to your home and then move on with the Lord into different Avenues that's the way we grow up into the Lord amen amen that's the way we grow up into the Lord when they just say love your wife husband we spoke about it on Sunday we we we explain it down and break it down if you just do what God is asking you to do automatically there is no ground for that devil to stay there amen he will try to show you like he's not going but he's already going because you have obeyed God that's as simple as it is amen amen if you wife you put yourself back in your position automatically what is God doing with the blessings he have do you think God need a chair do you think God need a house the Bible say everything belongs to him you're the one that are looking for church amen you're the one that looked for your house you're the one looking for healing he wanted to give you what you want to get amen but he's asking you to do something very simple we get just taught I mean twisted and and complicated just because we don't want to give away something that is very simple amen we have other things that we put before and you wonder why God is not doing this how can God give you a husband in the state you are you going to torment him you wanna you go ahead you do it and you fix it in the marriage you see how hard it is why do you want God to give your wife in a statuary why do you want God to bless you with money in the way you are you can't even come to church so if they give you more money are you going to come to church forget it you're gone because your Prosperity is what what is attaching you to God yeah I will begin to come to church when everything begin to work good amen amen that's not gonna work give him preeminence amen and he will let you go through trial and as Aston Mason he's cutting whatever need to be kind of your life little by little little by little when he sees fit that this is the time that she reached the level that I want her to meet you will be surprised what God can do and you will regret why you didn't give him the preeminence all along in other words you were the one blocking God from blessing you because of what you're trying to achieve amen amen amen when we serve the Lord sometime he appears like we don't have life sometimes it's appearing like we don't have fun the other people are having fun the way they want just being in the church all the time being in the question and answering all the time we don't go out doing something you will realize one time that those people are more peaceful at home than the one you're thinking are having fun you don't talk to people I talk to people I see the woman on the wheelchair the heavy set woman on the wheelchair moving up and I talked to her she turned around she'd say you don't understand doctor I have been raped just like that you don't know what people has been through you don't know you just hear it and it never happened to you you don't know how gracious you are to even just go home and sleep without taking a pill you don't know how many people are taking pills just to get some sleep but they're driving beautiful car more than you they're running big offices more than you and you're looking at them on the outside thinking they are good while they're struggling they're looking like if I can get this [Music] amen happiness is not about what we get amen happiness it doesn't depend on what you have amen amen amen you can have everything you see a multi-millionaire with cancer what is he going to do with cancer you can give all the all the money you want to and the doctor say there's nothing we can do it's in the last stage there is nothing money can do with all God is asking you is simple God is wanting to heal a home heal our families heal our life amen why do you want to continue in the religion where you and your husband fasting all the time all the time all the time all the time all the time all the time tomorrow it's finances Good tomorrow done tomorrow go tomorrow now tomorrow sickness tomorrow this why do you want to continue in and and you're satisfy with that for 20 years for 30 years for 35 years and you're still good and God want to flip it and change it to give you a hope the plan that he had for us is to give us a hope so that you can go home and sit down you say finally I understand you see the home peacefully you're not under stress amen amen that's what God wanted to do it's this it's the Mason he's just cutting whatever is off so that our children can get healed our wives can get here our husband can get healed our business get here our whatever we have every aspect of our life we wanted to prosper but the Bible say your Prosperity goes along with the prosperity of your soul the Bible say I want you to prosper as your soul Prosper your soul is not prospering but you want to prosper and if you happen it's a Dangerous Ground yeah because the Rich Young Ruler rejected Jesus Christ he prospered he ended up in hell amen God is molding us so you can eat your food and enjoy the food whether it's a restaurant whether it's a McDonald but you can at least taste the food the verses you get it but you don't even taste it you'll be eating daddy the haste because you gotta go somewhere there's no joy amen amen all you see on the Internet is just faking people are pretending some are pretending being big people some are pretending being spiritual some are pretending that they move on to a big life all of that are pretense you sit with them people are depressed the world is insane the way people are thinking now is insane just to be able to think the way you think it's a blessing amen amen just to be able to think the way you're thinking it's a blessing amen amen there was somebody that knocked his car he went to the judge they just said yes you can prosecute but I'm telling you if you prosecute those people can come back after you now if if a judge telling you that what are you going to do huh somebody taking a woman rape her they put him in the barn and after the bond they take the bond they lower that and they put the men back again he's going to go back on the street and there are many of them like that on the street many of them like that they were supposed to stay locked up they out who are you dealing with everybody okay God simple is trying to mold you whatever he tells you is simple look at the brains and alter just look just look and you'll see if you're not gonna get healed don't sit down and say no what is looking going to do with a wound so you think if I'm just looking at that thing my wound will go away that's the problem that's why your men got shot because when they brought him the pardon he said he said no no the pardon cannot come like this you must have an official stamp of the United States it must be this way it must be this way that's why many people misses God because they want God to mold himself in their program and to come the way they want it to come that's why the Pharisee missed God and the woman at the world will all must Miss God because God used a Jewish flesh amen I must have missed God for that because she wanted a Samaritan to bring the gospel then he will actually then then it's going to be okay almost Miss God Amen God come in different form it's very easy what else do you want it's easy let's stand your deliverance is not complicated obedience to God will take demon out of your life without you screaming just coming to church the way you're coming you don't know what it's doing to your life you don't know when the time of that prodigal son will turn around and come back just because of your faithfulness and God say now Abraham I know that you love me amen now I know that you love me I just want you to take you to stretch a little bit so I can see really if Abraham you love me now I see that you love me go watch go read the Genesis after Genesis 22 or go see how God multiply Abraham because when uh early years they went there he said the Lord has blessed my master that was not before Abraham was struggling trying to find something him and lot the land was so small go see after that Temptation go see how Abraham turned out to be until God begin to call him a friend and God is coming and discussing with him like you know what I'm trying to destroy Sodom Abraham what do you think and Abraham begin to bring some input he said but you know you're a good God you think God doesn't know he was a good guy yeah but Abraham was talking to God you know you're a good guy but how can you destroy what about 50 what about what about what about what about what about all of that to just kill the poor lot out amen that's where God wants you you got Uncle you got a loved one you got people that are out how can you help them with the temper that you have how can you help them with the life that you live in no they must see a change when they see a change you won't talk too much when they see a change as soon as they see you they will recognize that okay something have another person I know how he used to be if that person become like this no there is a God somewhere when you before you even speak the person say I know I know I need to put my life right with God and you wonder praise the Lord how did you know about here because you just position yourself and God take care of the remaining don't fight you fought too much it's a lot of work take your hand off relax life is good with Jesus Christ even our trial gets sweeter because he would not try you above your means if I tell you what I go through you will say no there's no way you can go through something like that but he knows my level and he put it according to my level he knows your because so don't think yours is the end of the world no no no let's pray Heavenly Father Lord we are thanking you again once again father for coming tonight and speaking to our soul and expressing yourself to be the Lord that is building the house and father just to have the thought that you are the one building the house makes a difference it finishes everything because we know that when you you are building it means that you are the alpha and not only are you going to be the alpha of the building of that building father but you're going to be also the Omega in other words everything that you do is always right and if we have been built by you what kind of people are the way to be father and what kind of privilege to have the almighty God father expressing his interest in our own life and the details of our life until a minister can stand here and speak and we know exactly that that Minister didn't know what I was going through that must be God it is showing to us that you are more present with us than we can realize father may we be caught up into that vision into the Revelation into that understanding to no Lord father that you are calling people for a different work now you want to walk with your brother you want to express yourself through that bread you want to show that Brad that whatever you heard all over the year now the time has come that you will see exactly what I was trying to say father May nobody misses it may we forget about the trial and the destruction that the devil is trying to bring but may we if we focus again our life knowing like that you are the author and you are the finisher of our faith if you started this church father you're going to take it all the way to the Rapture Lord may you strengthen your children may you touch those that are sick may you help those that are struggling emotionally and those that are going through a certain difficulties in their life father you know them Lord may you consecrate ourselves Lord for your service and may you remember also the question and answer and the service coming up on the weekend so that one more time father you can move us away and you can come and minister to your children and place them give them travel Mercy Lord father remember those sacrifice for just being able to come tonight Lord when the temperature are going down many could have stayed home and say we have a streaming but Lord every day every Wednesday they are coming making an effort Lord to show you their faithfulness Lord father may you remember them and bless them Father with this cold weather May you protect us may you protect our families may you protect this church Lord father from viruses Lord going around left and right Lord father may you help us Lord father get again more deeper into your presence so that we can spend that intimacy with you to know what is the next move and what is
