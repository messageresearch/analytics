[39:23] amen brother branham said the reason why
[39:26] jesus
[39:27] went into the tomb because david
[39:30] already prophesied so when he was
[39:33] jumping into the tomb
[39:34] he knew that he would never leave his
[39:37] anointed
[39:38] sea corruption so no matter how dark he
[39:41] looks

[51:06] our souls tonight
[51:08] and we pray father that this this
[51:10] atmosphere will just be pleasing
[51:13] to you lord to come into our midst and
[51:15] break
[51:16] the bread of life to us lord as our
[51:18] brother was
[51:20] was referring to a few moments ago lord
[51:24] how you
[51:24] rebuked those disciples after the
[51:27] resurrection and you said oh fools
[51:29] and slew of heart and lord they they
[51:32] pondered in their minds
[51:33] and they even rejoiced lord at the words
[51:37] you spoke
[51:38] but it was only when the doors were
[51:39] closed
[51:41] and you broke the bread of life lord
[51:43] were their eyes open
[51:45] and they realized lord you weren't dead
[51:49] you weren't still sealed in a tomb lord
[51:51] you weren't a memory
[51:53] you weren't history but you were living
[51:55] lord there to fulfill the promise of
[51:57] your word
[51:58] and lord we pray that you will again
[52:01] make yourself known tonight lord
[52:03] in the breaking of the bread lord may
[52:05] you take what what has been prepared
[52:08] lord
[52:08] and just serve it tonight lord minister
[52:12] it
[52:12] may you speak in our midst father god
[52:14] and may your may your holy spirit
[52:17] have complete preeminence lord in every
[52:19] part of this service
[52:21] give us grace lord we pray that your
[52:23] perfect will may be done
[52:24] in jesus christ's name we ask it amen
[52:28] colossians chapter 3 uh beginning at
[52:31] verse
[52:32] 12 put on therefore as the elect of god
[52:36] holy and beloved bowels of mercies
[52:39] kindness humbleness of mind
[52:42] meekness long-suffering forgiving
[52:46] one another for bearing one another and
[52:49] forgiving one another
[52:51] if any man have a quarrel against any
[52:55] as even as christ forgave you
[52:59] so also do ye and above
[53:02] all these things put on charity which is
[53:05] the bond of perfectness
[53:08] and let the peace of god rule in your
[53:10] hearts to the which
[53:12] also you are called in one body and be
[53:15] ye
[53:15] thankful let the word of christ dwell
[53:18] in you richly in all wisdom teaching and
[53:22] admonishing one another
[53:24] in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs
[53:27] singing with grace in your hearts to the
[53:29] lord
[53:30] and whatsoever ye do in word or deed
[53:34] do all in the name of the lord jesus
[53:37] giving thanks to god in the father by
[53:40] him
[53:41] let's also move down to verse 23 as we
[53:44] continue
[53:45] and whatsoever ye do do it heartily
[53:48] as to the lord and not unto men
[53:51] knowing that of the lord you shall
[53:53] receive the reward of the inheritance
[53:56] for ye serve the lord christ but he that
[53:59] doeth wrong shall receive for the wrong
[54:01] which he hath done
[54:02] and there is no respect of persons may
[54:05] the lord bless the reading of his word
[54:07] this evening
[54:07] you may be seated and i want to take for
[54:11] a title tonight for this thought
[54:15] three kinds of christians
[54:19] three kinds of christians now
[54:22] we know that the prophet of god preached
[54:25] on the
[54:26] believer the make-believer and the
[54:28] unbeliever
[54:30] and that's that's also three types of
[54:32] believers but i i'm not going to be
[54:34] dealing with
[54:35] that uh those types tonight i'm going to
[54:38] be dealing with
[54:39] three other kinds of christians or
[54:42] so-called christians
[54:44] and so the the first one i want to to
[54:47] speak
[54:48] uh speak about tonight is
[54:51] the casual christian the casual
[54:55] christian and the way i would describe
[54:58] the casual christian tonight
[55:00] is the laodicean christian amen because
[55:04] we know the laodiceans
[55:06] they were not hot and they were not cold
[55:10] they were lukewarm in a lukewarm
[55:13] condition
[55:14] and that's the way this casual christian
[55:17] is tonight
[55:18] he's not hot he he's not really on fire
[55:21] for god
[55:23] but he's not completely cold either amen
[55:26] he's just somewhere in the middle
[55:29] and so this contemporary christian
[55:33] he is a is a unique character because
[55:36] you know no matter what he claims to
[55:39] believe
[55:40] he can blend in in almost any crowd
[55:44] or any setting because he's a casual
[55:48] christian amen he he can be a
[55:51] he could fit in at church amongst
[55:53] believers
[55:54] and he can also walk right out the door
[55:57] and fit in
[55:58] amen at work he can fit in with the
[56:01] contemporary
[56:02] crowd he can fit in with the the
[56:04] unbeliever
[56:05] the denominational believer you can put
[56:08] him
[56:08] in any setting and somehow
[56:11] he will just blend in and fit in
[56:14] in other words he's not going to offend
[56:16] anyone with his beliefs
[56:19] he's not going to make anybody including
[56:21] the devil
[56:23] uncomfortable with his convictions
[56:26] amen he's not going to speak out against
[56:28] something that's wrong
[56:30] or something you know there's hardly
[56:31] anything that offends this person
[56:34] and they don't offend anyone else
[56:37] now they want to be saved and they want
[56:40] to go to heaven when they die
[56:42] but they just don't want to take things
[56:47] too far they've seen others
[56:50] get too carried away and fall into
[56:54] fanaticism and so this individual is not
[56:58] going to invest their whole life
[57:02] their whole heart and their whole soul
[57:06] into anything pertaining to the things
[57:09] of god
[57:11] they're uh they're happy to watch from a
[57:14] distance
[57:16] and they're happy to watch the blessings
[57:19] fall on everyone else in the service
[57:22] everyone else in the church amen the
[57:25] power of god can be moving
[57:27] and the spirit of god can be falling
[57:29] amen people can be rejoicing and
[57:31] praising god
[57:33] but this casual christian doesn't want
[57:35] to be branded
[57:37] or identified as a fanatic
[57:40] so so that so he or she is not going to
[57:43] get into the spirit
[57:44] they're not going to really enter into
[57:47] the service they're they're not going to
[57:48] be called shouting
[57:50] or dancing or screaming or praising god
[57:52] or or speaking in tongues or any of
[57:54] those things
[57:55] because that's fanatical but they'll
[57:58] stand right there
[57:59] and watch everybody else get a blessing
[58:02] amen watch everybody else get a touch
[58:04] from god
[58:05] watch others be saved and healed and
[58:08] delivered
[58:09] and they'll walk out of that same
[58:11] service
[58:13] the same way they walked in to the
[58:15] service
[58:17] now if you're not careful
[58:20] you will offend the casual christian
[58:25] if you work with the casual christian
[58:30] be careful not to talk to them
[58:33] at work about what happened at church
[58:38] don't talk about how good the service
[58:40] was don't talk about how the word of god
[58:43] was broken and
[58:44] and fed your soul and thrilled your
[58:46] heart
[58:48] they might even get offended if you pray
[58:50] over your meal
[58:53] because they are a casual christian
[58:57] they don't want to be known as a fanatic
[59:00] they don't want to be known as an on
[59:02] fire christian amen
[59:03] if if they pray for their food it might
[59:05] look like they're just
[59:07] you know wiping their nose at the same
[59:08] time or something like that
[59:10] because they're they're they're uh
[59:13] they're a casual christian
[59:15] they're they're a covert christian amen
[59:17] they're almost like a spy
[59:21] they want to be to be known as a
[59:23] christian
[59:24] but yet they want to be undercover
[59:28] so be careful if you're reading your
[59:30] bible
[59:31] on the job you might offend the casual
[59:34] christian
[59:36] if you pray over your food in public if
[59:38] if you begin
[59:39] testifying of god's goodness his
[59:42] salvation is mercy man
[59:45] if someone has received christ as their
[59:47] savior
[59:49] just speaking about it kind of makes the
[59:51] casual christian
[59:52] a little bit uncomfortable
[59:56] you know i i hate to call names but
[59:59] i think it's okay uh years ago when i
[1:00:02] was
[1:00:03] when i was a teenager we went to a
[1:00:05] christian concert
[1:00:07] and it was in asheville north carolina
[1:00:10] it was a gaither
[1:00:11] concert so it had the gaither vocal band
[1:00:13] and all of these other
[1:00:15] christian singers and groups there
[1:00:18] and at the beginning of this of this
[1:00:21] concert
[1:00:22] gloria gaither bill gaither's wife
[1:00:26] was asked to give the opening prayer
[1:00:30] and i'll never forget it because she
[1:00:32] prayed this prayer
[1:00:34] and at the end of this of this beautiful
[1:00:37] prayer that she prayed
[1:00:38] she said and we ask all of these things
[1:00:43] in the name
[1:00:47] and that was the end of her prayer
[1:00:51] and i on the inside i was boiling
[1:00:54] i wanted to shout out in the middle of
[1:00:56] that auditorium
[1:00:58] his name is jesus amen
[1:01:02] jesus is my savior jesus is who bled and
[1:01:05] died for my sins
[1:01:07] jesus is who was buried in the tomb and
[1:01:10] jesus
[1:01:10] is who resurrected on that third and
[1:01:12] glorious day
[1:01:13] amen it was jesus jesus
[1:01:16] is his name but i thought you know here
[1:01:20] is a person a highly renowned a a
[1:01:24] person known throughout the world for
[1:01:26] the songs that have been written and the
[1:01:28] gift of god
[1:01:29] in her life but yet in this modern age
[1:01:34] where we're not supposed to we're not
[1:01:37] supposed to make anyone
[1:01:38] uncomfortable we're not supposed to be
[1:01:41] branded amen
[1:01:42] we're all supposed to just blend in
[1:01:44] anymore
[1:01:45] she didn't want to mention the name of
[1:01:48] god
[1:01:48] and possibly offend a non-non-believer
[1:01:54] or a muslim or a person of some other
[1:01:57] faith
[1:01:58] but you know what i'm a christian
[1:02:00] tonight
[1:02:01] amen to be a christian you have to be
[1:02:04] identified
[1:02:05] with jesus christ you have to be
[1:02:08] identified
[1:02:10] with the word of god and i want to tell
[1:02:12] you to be a believer in this hour
[1:02:14] you won't be ashamed to be identified
[1:02:17] with the revealed word of this hour
[1:02:19] or with the servant of god that he sent
[1:02:21] the prophet of god to this age amen
[1:02:24] the true believer amen cannot be a
[1:02:27] casual believer
[1:02:28] amen but they are not ashamed to be
[1:02:30] identified
[1:02:32] with jesus christ and who he is
[1:02:35] amen the prophet of god says this in the
[1:02:39] message the breach he said a woman just
[1:02:41] called up another woman
[1:02:43] said you know i'm episcopalian
[1:02:46] said i spoke in tongues the other day
[1:02:49] i believe i received the holy ghost
[1:02:54] but
[1:02:58] don't tell nobody
[1:03:03] don't tell nobody the prophet of god
[1:03:06] says
[1:03:07] i doubt that very much you might have
[1:03:10] spoke with tongues
[1:03:12] but you set a man on fire how
[1:03:15] is he going to sit still that's right
[1:03:18] can't do it amen he said can you imagine
[1:03:21] peter james and john and them up in the
[1:03:23] upper room
[1:03:24] saying oh we got the holy ghost now but
[1:03:27] maybe we better just keep still
[1:03:30] brother through windows doors and
[1:03:33] everything they went amen
[1:03:35] out in the street acting like a bunch of
[1:03:37] drunks
[1:03:40] that's the holy ghost hey
[1:03:45] amen i thank god tonight amen
[1:03:48] i do not want to be a casual christian
[1:03:51] i don't want to be someone that feels
[1:03:53] like we've got to be able to blend
[1:03:55] in to whatever setting we're placed into
[1:03:58] amen i'm thankful tonight
[1:03:59] that the hebrew children was not casual
[1:04:02] christians
[1:04:03] amen when daniel was commanded when it
[1:04:05] became illegal
[1:04:07] for daniel to pray out loud he never
[1:04:10] changed
[1:04:10] his habits he never changed his
[1:04:13] relationship with god
[1:04:15] he threw open the windows the next
[1:04:17] morning and said all
[1:04:18] thank you jehovah god for giving me
[1:04:21] another day
[1:04:23] amen he was not a casual christian
[1:04:27] amen in acts chapter 5 verse 17
[1:04:31] amen let's you know i think sometimes
[1:04:34] it's good
[1:04:35] to look up our family tree
[1:04:37] [Music]
[1:04:38] and to identify with our ancestors
[1:04:41] amen the bible says in acts 5
[1:04:44] 17 then the high priest rose up
[1:04:48] and all they that were with him which
[1:04:50] are which is the sect of the sadducees
[1:04:53] and were filled with indignation
[1:04:56] and laid their hands on the apostles
[1:05:00] and put them in the common prison
[1:05:03] that was one way believers were known in
[1:05:06] that hour
[1:05:06] was they were being imprisoned
[1:05:09] for their stand you know some brother
[1:05:12] kelly
[1:05:13] this just struck me the other day do you
[1:05:16] know who persecuted
[1:05:17] the the true christians the
[1:05:21] was the so-called christians
[1:05:25] it was the jews it was the followers of
[1:05:28] moses
[1:05:30] i mean it was the jewish faith that
[1:05:33] persecuted the spirit spirit-filled
[1:05:36] christian in the book of acts
[1:05:40] they were the ones who killed james
[1:05:42] john's brother amen
[1:05:43] because the bible says herod killed
[1:05:45] james the brother of john
[1:05:47] when he saw how much it pleased
[1:05:50] the jews it wasn't
[1:05:54] unbelievers who were bringing this
[1:05:55] persecution
[1:05:57] so much it was their so-called
[1:06:00] jewish brethren
[1:06:06] oh my jesus said rejoice and be
[1:06:08] exceeding glad
[1:06:10] for so persecuted they the fathers
[1:06:12] before you amen
[1:06:14] oh my they laid their hands on the
[1:06:16] apostles put them in the common prison
[1:06:19] verse 19 but the angel of the lord by
[1:06:23] night
[1:06:24] opened the prison doors and brought them
[1:06:27] forth
[1:06:27] and said be still
[1:06:32] and be quiet was that the angel's
[1:06:35] commission
[1:06:36] did i read that verse correctly verse 20
[1:06:40] no the angel said go stand
[1:06:44] and speak to the people
[1:06:48] all the words of this life
[1:06:52] and when they heard that they entered
[1:06:54] into the temple early in the morning and
[1:06:56] taught
[1:06:57] the high priest came and they they were
[1:06:59] that were with him
[1:07:00] and called the council together and all
[1:07:02] the senate of the children of israel
[1:07:05] and sent to the prison to have them
[1:07:07] brought
[1:07:08] when the officers came and found them
[1:07:11] not in the prison
[1:07:13] they returned and said saying the prison
[1:07:16] truly found we shut with all safety
[1:07:18] and the keepers standing with out before
[1:07:20] the doors
[1:07:21] but when we had opened we found no man
[1:07:25] within
[1:07:26] the chief priest and the captain of the
[1:07:28] temple and
[1:07:30] excuse me when the high priest and the
[1:07:32] captain of the temple and the chief
[1:07:33] priests
[1:07:34] heard these things they doubted of them
[1:07:36] where unto this would grow
[1:07:39] then came one and told him saying behold
[1:07:42] the men
[1:07:43] whom ye put in prison are
[1:07:46] standing in the temple
[1:07:49] and teaching the people
[1:07:57] it doesn't matter where man puts you
[1:08:01] or where men put you god
[1:08:04] is going to take you from that place
[1:08:07] and set you and establish you where he
[1:08:10] desires you to
[1:08:12] and give you a voice to speak his will
[1:08:16] amen it was the the it was the religious
[1:08:19] leaders that put him in the prison but
[1:08:22] god put him back in the temple
[1:08:24] it was the religious leaders that tried
[1:08:27] to silence their voice
[1:08:28] but god gave them a voice it was
[1:08:31] religious leaders that was trying to
[1:08:33] extinguish this amen but god found it
[1:08:36] back to life amen
[1:08:38] oh glory to god i don't want to be a
[1:08:40] casual christian
[1:08:42] let's go on then went to
[1:08:46] captain with the officers and brought
[1:08:47] them without violence
[1:08:49] for they feared the people lest they
[1:08:51] should have been stoned
[1:08:52] and when they had brought them they sent
[1:08:54] them before the council
[1:08:55] and the high priest asked them
[1:08:59] saying did we not straightly command you
[1:09:01] that you should not
[1:09:02] teach in this name and behold
[1:09:05] ye have filled jerusalem with your
[1:09:09] doctrine
[1:09:09] and intend to bring this man's blood
[1:09:12] upon us
[1:09:14] then peter and the other apostles
[1:09:17] answered and said
[1:09:18] i like this response and i think it's
[1:09:21] something we should all
[1:09:22] commit to memory tonight peter said
[1:09:26] we ought to obey god
[1:09:30] rather than men amen we
[1:09:33] are accountable we are answering to god
[1:09:37] amen we are reporting to god
[1:09:40] we are his agents amen we are his
[1:09:44] soldiers
[1:09:45] amen he bought us with his blood he gave
[1:09:48] us this commission
[1:09:49] go ye into all the world and preach the
[1:09:52] gospel
[1:09:52] heal the sick amen cast out devils amen
[1:09:55] if you shall drink in the deadly thing
[1:09:57] it shall not harm you
[1:09:59] amen and you shall lay hands on the sick
[1:10:01] and they shall recover
[1:10:03] i am operating under orders from a
[1:10:06] higher authority
[1:10:08] than the united states government than
[1:10:10] any world government
[1:10:12] world power church leader no man has
[1:10:15] authority
[1:10:16] over the believer amen he is under
[1:10:19] the jurisdiction of the holy ghost
[1:10:23] amen peter told him
[1:10:26] i'm operating under the chain of command
[1:10:29] we
[1:10:30] ought to obey god rather than men
[1:10:34] amen it doesn't matter what your vote is
[1:10:37] it doesn't matter what your consensus
[1:10:39] is it doesn't matter what the world
[1:10:41] opinion is amen
[1:10:42] what god said is what matters
[1:10:46] amen we ought to obey god
[1:10:50] rather than men the god of our fathers
[1:10:53] raised up jesus whom you slew and hanged
[1:10:56] on a tree
[1:10:57] him hath god exalted with his right hand
[1:11:00] to be a prince
[1:11:01] and a savior for to give repentance to
[1:11:04] israel
[1:11:05] and forgiveness of sins and we
[1:11:08] are his witnesses of these things
[1:11:12] [Music]
[1:11:13] and so is the holy ghost whom god hath
[1:11:17] given to them that obey him
[1:11:20] when they heard that they were cut to
[1:11:22] the heart
[1:11:23] and took counsel to slay them
[1:11:26] amen peter and these apostles
[1:11:29] were not casual christians
[1:11:33] they were extreme christians they were
[1:11:36] not laodiceans amen
[1:11:37] they were not lukewarm but they were on
[1:11:40] fire
[1:11:40] for god i want to tell you this you
[1:11:44] cannot be a casual christian
[1:11:46] at token time
[1:11:50] amen when the token message goes forth
[1:11:53] you're either going to apply it and be
[1:11:56] spared
[1:11:57] or the death angel is going to strike
[1:11:59] you home
[1:12:01] amen there is no middle ground there
[1:12:04] there's no
[1:12:04] in between amen there's no lukewarm you
[1:12:07] were either in
[1:12:08] or you were out amen and if god brought
[1:12:12] this message
[1:12:13] god gave this provision it is god who is
[1:12:16] backing it
[1:12:17] god who is enforcing it and we are
[1:12:19] obeying
[1:12:20] god's commandment amen and we are under
[1:12:23] his protection
[1:12:24] to be spared from the effects of the
[1:12:27] death angel
[1:12:28] amen praise the lord
[1:12:32] you can't be a poser any longer it's
[1:12:35] manifesting time
[1:12:37] it's manifesting time amen in
[1:12:40] in the tassel stage it could be anything
[1:12:43] in the stock stage it could be anything
[1:12:46] i mean when it comes up it can be any
[1:12:48] but when the seed comes forth
[1:12:50] at harvest time it becomes very evident
[1:12:54] that's a wheat and that's a tear
[1:12:58] that's a wheat and that's a tear amen
[1:13:01] there's no more confusion
[1:13:03] amen there's no more ambivalence about
[1:13:05] it it's either one or the other
[1:13:07] you're either in or out so that is
[1:13:11] the casual christian now i want to go to
[1:13:16] another type of christian and i call
[1:13:19] this
[1:13:20] the costume christian
[1:13:24] oh you think halloween is the only time
[1:13:27] of year people
[1:13:28] put on costumes and pretend to be other
[1:13:30] people or other characters
[1:13:33] no that goes on year round
[1:13:37] and one of the most popular places for
[1:13:39] people to wear costumes
[1:13:42] is church church
[1:13:46] [Music]
[1:13:47] and the costumed christian is the most
[1:13:51] shameful of any of these three
[1:13:53] categories
[1:13:55] because they can appear as anything
[1:13:59] and they can act as anything and they
[1:14:02] can make a very persuasive
[1:14:04] and convincing argument amen
[1:14:07] or give this project this image to
[1:14:10] almost
[1:14:11] anybody to be almost anything
[1:14:14] judas was a costume
[1:14:17] christian he never had a birth
[1:14:21] he never had the life of jesus christ
[1:14:23] living out from him
[1:14:24] he was never sold out amen he was never
[1:14:28] completely convinced but he acted the
[1:14:31] part
[1:14:31] he dressed the part he even even
[1:14:34] performed miracles
[1:14:36] he even took a part in the ministry of
[1:14:38] jesus disciples
[1:14:39] and was so trusted he was allowed to
[1:14:41] hold the the money
[1:14:43] and the treasure but you know what
[1:14:47] when judas became offended when judas
[1:14:50] became
[1:14:50] ashamed when judas when when the
[1:14:53] pressure was on and he no longer wanted
[1:14:55] to be identified as a disciple
[1:14:58] he put on another costume and he went
[1:15:01] right out to the authorities and sold
[1:15:04] the lord jesus
[1:15:05] for 30 pieces of silver
[1:15:09] the costume christian their
[1:15:12] christianity is a costume
[1:15:15] or a character that they play
[1:15:19] on sunday morning they put
[1:15:22] on the costume
[1:15:25] of a christian and drive to church
[1:15:30] and come into the service and my
[1:15:34] how they play my how they act
[1:15:38] you would never think this is the casual
[1:15:41] christian
[1:15:42] because they can sing the loudest
[1:15:45] they they they want to sing a special
[1:15:47] they've got a testimony to give
[1:15:50] and they they they have influence and
[1:15:53] they
[1:15:53] want to be influential because they want
[1:15:57] to convince
[1:15:58] everyone they possibly can that they are
[1:16:01] not just a christian
[1:16:02] they are a good christian
[1:16:06] they have all the appearances of a
[1:16:09] devout christian
[1:16:10] and they will put the casual christian
[1:16:13] to shame
[1:16:15] as far as the appearances like i said
[1:16:17] they'll show up for church
[1:16:18] they'll lead in prayer they'll sing and
[1:16:20] they'll shout but when that's all over
[1:16:24] and they get back home that costume
[1:16:29] is very carefully removed
[1:16:33] and buttoned up with no wrinkles no
[1:16:36] creases
[1:16:37] no blemishes and it's put on a hanger
[1:16:41] and put back into the closet
[1:16:45] and it won't be worn again until the
[1:16:48] next church service
[1:16:51] or maybe if the pastor comes over for
[1:16:53] dinner
[1:16:54] they'll pull that out of the closet and
[1:16:57] put it on again
[1:16:58] but for the most part that costume only
[1:17:02] gets worn
[1:17:03] when they're going to be around other
[1:17:06] christian people
[1:17:08] because they have other costumes
[1:17:12] that they put on as well so when the
[1:17:15] christian costume
[1:17:16] goes off they'll put on another act
[1:17:20] or the the real person will then come
[1:17:24] out
[1:17:25] and they'll be hateful to their family
[1:17:28] hateful to the husband hateful to the
[1:17:30] wife
[1:17:31] hateful to the children hateful to the
[1:17:34] neighbors
[1:17:35] amen they they they are a terror to be
[1:17:38] driving around them in traffic
[1:17:41] because they're rude they're angry
[1:17:44] they're impatient amen they will they
[1:17:46] they will cut you off
[1:17:48] and then they'll they'll do they see
[1:17:50] that christian costume is in the closet
[1:17:53] they don't have to be a christian any
[1:17:55] longer that's been put away
[1:17:56] now they're just out there scratching
[1:17:58] with the rest of the world
[1:18:00] they're out there rubbing shoulders with
[1:18:01] the rest of the world you see
[1:18:03] they'll use different language they'll
[1:18:07] they'll all they'll tell the dirty jokes
[1:18:09] with the co-workers they'll laugh
[1:18:12] they'll they'll they'll drink they'll
[1:18:14] smoke
[1:18:16] they'll do they'll you know sometimes if
[1:18:18] it's a young person
[1:18:19] uh oh she'll wear dresses at home in a
[1:18:22] church
[1:18:22] but she's got a pair of pants in the
[1:18:24] locker room at school
[1:18:26] and she's going to put those pants on
[1:18:28] when she gets to school because
[1:18:30] she wants to fit in with the worldly
[1:18:32] girls
[1:18:34] and christianity to her is just a
[1:18:36] costume
[1:18:37] and it ain't just girls the boys do the
[1:18:40] same thing
[1:18:41] they got their little jewelry and they
[1:18:43] got their shorts
[1:18:44] and they got their stick on tattoos and
[1:18:47] they got all these other things that
[1:18:49] they'll put on
[1:18:50] to try to blend in with their classmates
[1:18:53] and their school
[1:18:54] friends this is a costume christian
[1:18:58] at church they look like
[1:19:02] a sheep but their outfit
[1:19:06] has a zipper it'll set off
[1:19:11] a spiritual metal detector
[1:19:14] when the costume christian comes into
[1:19:16] the service
[1:19:17] the holy spirit is like an x-ray machine
[1:19:23] and it'll make that costume christian
[1:19:25] uncomfortable
[1:19:26] and they'll be sitting there in a suit
[1:19:28] and just they'll look nicer than the
[1:19:30] pastor
[1:19:31] but when real conviction begins to be
[1:19:33] preached
[1:19:34] amen and now let now they'll say amen
[1:19:37] for the mysteries
[1:19:38] and they'll say amen god sent a prophet
[1:19:40] and as long as the deep things are being
[1:19:43] preached
[1:19:43] and the doctrines are being told and all
[1:19:46] the wonderful things of the message are
[1:19:48] being laid out
[1:19:49] they'll say amen but if you start
[1:19:51] preaching on where they live
[1:19:53] and you talk about conduct order and
[1:19:55] doctrine or you talk about
[1:19:57] tithes and offerings or you talk about
[1:20:00] christian living amen or the baptism of
[1:20:03] the holy ghost
[1:20:05] all of a sudden they got to go to the
[1:20:08] bathroom
[1:20:09] they got to go outside and take a phone
[1:20:11] call something just came up
[1:20:13] and they have to remove themselves from
[1:20:16] the situation
[1:20:18] and the holy spirit is exposing
[1:20:21] the zipper that wool didn't grow out
[1:20:26] that wool was put on and can be taken
[1:20:28] off
[1:20:30] and that's a costume christian but i
[1:20:33] want to tell you tonight
[1:20:34] the costumed christian is a dangerous
[1:20:38] dangerous role the costumed
[1:20:42] christians that the bible describes to
[1:20:44] us never have a good outcome
[1:20:47] there's never a good ending to their
[1:20:49] life and one of those
[1:20:51] costumed christians was the name of was
[1:20:53] by the name of king ahab
[1:20:57] king ahab amen he could he could appear
[1:21:00] religious
[1:21:02] he could consult with the prophet amen
[1:21:05] he knew where to go to get the word of
[1:21:07] the lord
[1:21:09] but he had a hard time accepting it and
[1:21:12] putting it into practice
[1:21:14] so we know how they called for the
[1:21:16] prophets that day and
[1:21:17] uh shall we go up to rhemath gilead and
[1:21:20] all the 400 prophets said go up and and
[1:21:23] i believe it was jehoshaphat said don't
[1:21:25] you have one more
[1:21:28] and he said yes but i hate him because
[1:21:31] he knows i gotta
[1:21:33] every you know i can't i can't pay him
[1:21:36] off
[1:21:37] i can't influence him with my money
[1:21:40] i can't offer him prestige and position
[1:21:44] and power there's nothing i can do to
[1:21:47] persuade him
[1:21:48] he doesn't like me and
[1:21:52] anything he says is the word of the lord
[1:21:55] and he never said one good thing about
[1:21:57] me
[1:21:59] and you know somehow jehoshaphat knew
[1:22:01] that's the guy we need to hear from
[1:22:04] that's the man we need to hear from the
[1:22:07] man that cannot be bought the man that
[1:22:10] cannot be persuaded
[1:22:12] and the man that tells the truth because
[1:22:14] it's not his words
[1:22:16] it's god's words amen that's who we need
[1:22:19] to hear from
[1:22:24] and when mekiah spoke he said go up
[1:22:27] go up but you're going to die
[1:22:31] go up because you're not in control
[1:22:34] prophecy is in control
[1:22:37] the words of the prophet that was spoken
[1:22:40] the dogs are going to lick ahab's blood
[1:22:43] those words are going to be fulfilled it
[1:22:46] doesn't matter if the prophet is present
[1:22:48] it doesn't matter if he's still alive
[1:22:50] the word of god is going to be fulfilled
[1:22:55] so you know what ahab's idea was i'll
[1:22:58] put on
[1:23:00] a disguise
[1:23:03] he said jehoshaphat you dress
[1:23:06] up like a king
[1:23:10] you you put on your kingly garments
[1:23:13] jehoshaphat
[1:23:14] and i'll dress like something
[1:23:17] other than a king he was going to put on
[1:23:21] a costume
[1:23:23] because he felt like if if jehoshaphat
[1:23:26] could be noticed
[1:23:27] as a king it would put the spotlight
[1:23:32] on him and he would become the target of
[1:23:35] the enemy
[1:23:36] and his life would be taken instead of
[1:23:39] ahab's
[1:23:41] of whom the prophecy was given that he
[1:23:43] was going to die
[1:23:45] but i'm going to tell you all your
[1:23:46] costumes is not going to go around
[1:23:48] prophecy
[1:23:50] prophecy is going to still be fulfilled
[1:23:53] no matter how much you try to hide from
[1:23:55] it
[1:23:56] no matter how much you try to disguise
[1:23:58] yourself i mean no matter how much you
[1:24:00] try to change the outcome
[1:24:02] god's word is going to be fulfilled
[1:24:05] and and they went out to battle and the
[1:24:08] enemy spotted ahab
[1:24:10] they spotted jehoshaphat too but they
[1:24:12] said that's not our target
[1:24:15] there's ahab and they shot him
[1:24:18] they they shot up leave us with arrows
[1:24:20] and he died that day
[1:24:22] and prophecy was fulfilled amen
[1:24:27] the enemy was not fooled by the disguise
[1:24:31] you know another costumed christian was
[1:24:33] saul
[1:24:35] who tried to disguise himself
[1:24:38] as someone else and go
[1:24:41] to the witch at indoor because he could
[1:24:45] no longer
[1:24:46] hear the word of god the word of god
[1:24:48] wouldn't speak to him any longer
[1:24:50] amen it was it was like the heavens were
[1:24:52] closed
[1:24:54] and he had made witchcraft illegal
[1:24:57] it was a a punishment of death
[1:25:00] it was a death sentence to be practicing
[1:25:03] this
[1:25:04] but yet he had he felt like he had to
[1:25:06] resort
[1:25:07] to this to learn of his future
[1:25:10] so he disguised himself and he goes down
[1:25:13] and goes into this medium who is a witch
[1:25:17] and as soon as she entered into that
[1:25:20] realm
[1:25:22] his disguise wouldn't work any longer
[1:25:25] she said you're saul you're saul
[1:25:29] you can't hide who you are amen all your
[1:25:32] robes
[1:25:33] all your disguise won't work i can see
[1:25:36] who you are
[1:25:38] and and she brought up the prophet
[1:25:40] samuel
[1:25:41] and he said tomorrow you'll be with me
[1:25:44] you know saul liked to operate his whole
[1:25:48] his whole ministry as king was under
[1:25:51] disguise
[1:25:53] he wanted to be identified with the
[1:25:55] prophet
[1:25:57] even when he had no word of the prophet
[1:26:00] he said
[1:26:01] you know remember when the enemy came in
[1:26:03] and he cut up those oxen
[1:26:05] and sent the pieces out throughout all
[1:26:06] of israel and he and he said so saith
[1:26:09] saul and samuel samuel never said that
[1:26:14] the bible doesn't say samuel had any
[1:26:16] involvement with that
[1:26:18] but small realized he had no credibility
[1:26:23] unless he wrapped his message in the
[1:26:26] cloak
[1:26:27] of a prophet and
[1:26:30] and presented it as the prophet's words
[1:26:34] or the prophet's teachings or the
[1:26:36] prophet's doctrine
[1:26:38] or the prophet's idea but the prophet
[1:26:40] had nothing to do with that
[1:26:42] that was saul amen trying to attach
[1:26:45] himself to a ministry that was
[1:26:48] vindicated
[1:26:50] that was authenticated by god and god
[1:26:53] was
[1:26:54] backing it amen with vindication
[1:26:57] oh and brother we got a lot of saul's
[1:26:59] roaming around this world today
[1:27:01] amen that want to borrow from the
[1:27:03] prophet's influence
[1:27:05] and to give their own ministry
[1:27:07] credibility
[1:27:08] when they don't believe the message they
[1:27:11] don't line up to it they haven't
[1:27:12] accepted it amen
[1:27:13] but they know it has power so they want
[1:27:17] to
[1:27:17] attach themselves to it
[1:27:19] [Music]
[1:27:21] amen but the holy spirit can see
[1:27:24] through that disguise amen it doesn't
[1:27:26] matter how much you love brother branham
[1:27:28] or tell his stories
[1:27:29] or i want to associate yourself
[1:27:33] with the things of the prophet if you
[1:27:35] don't have the the
[1:27:37] if you don't have the life of god living
[1:27:39] through you amen the word of god hasn't
[1:27:41] been quickened by the power of the holy
[1:27:43] spirit amen
[1:27:45] the holy spirit will expose that
[1:27:47] disguise
[1:27:50] amen the bible says in
[1:27:53] uh just very quickly first first peter
[1:27:57] told us this i don't want to be a
[1:28:00] costumed christian tonight
[1:28:02] and first peter 3 says likewise ye wives
[1:28:06] be in subjection to your own husbands
[1:28:08] that if any obey not the word they also
[1:28:11] may without the word
[1:28:13] be won by the conversation of the wives
[1:28:17] while they behold your chaste
[1:28:20] conversation
[1:28:21] coupled with fear whose adorning let it
[1:28:25] not be that outward adorning of plating
[1:28:28] the hair and of wearing of gold
[1:28:30] or of putting on of apparel
[1:28:34] but let it be the hidden man
[1:28:37] of the heart in that
[1:28:40] which is not corruptable even the
[1:28:43] ornament of a meek and quiet spirit
[1:28:46] which is in the sight of god of great
[1:28:49] price
[1:28:51] paul said that inward character
[1:28:54] that inward life that beauty
[1:28:58] can win the center
[1:29:01] it can win the unbelieving husband i
[1:29:04] mean
[1:29:04] it's not about it's not about how much
[1:29:06] you put on an outward appearance
[1:29:08] of a christian it's that life
[1:29:12] down on the inside amen that will compel
[1:29:16] even the unbeliever they know
[1:29:19] what you have is genuine
[1:29:23] it's it's like the the men in the bar
[1:29:25] room were talking about there's no
[1:29:26] genuine christians
[1:29:28] you know they're all hypocrites they're
[1:29:29] all unbelievers they're they're all just
[1:29:31] posers but the one man said that's not
[1:29:34] true
[1:29:35] i know of one who is genuine
[1:29:40] and he took those drunks to his home and
[1:29:43] and woke his wife up and said
[1:29:44] make us some breakfast you know and then
[1:29:47] threw the food on the floor and was
[1:29:49] breaking the dishes
[1:29:51] and she didn't hit him with the bible
[1:29:54] she didn't tell him who her pastor was
[1:29:56] she didn't start quoting quotes and
[1:29:58] reading scriptures and all those things
[1:30:00] she just stood in the frying pan
[1:30:03] stood at the stove in front of the
[1:30:06] frying pan
[1:30:07] must jesus bear the cross alone
[1:30:13] and all the world go free
[1:30:16] she lived the life amen she didn't have
[1:30:20] the
[1:30:20] outward it was something genuine on the
[1:30:23] inside
[1:30:24] and those men acknowledged that night
[1:30:28] there is a living genuine christian
[1:30:32] amen there are some real christians in
[1:30:34] the world today
[1:30:36] amen i'll just mention one other here
[1:30:41] a costume christian aiken
[1:30:45] was a costume christian
[1:30:48] he was an israelite but for some reason
[1:30:51] in the spoils of battle
[1:30:53] he felt to reserve to himself
[1:30:56] a golden wedge and a babylonian garment
[1:31:01] wonder why he was keeping a babylonian
[1:31:05] garment hanging in the closet
[1:31:10] you know why because he was never
[1:31:13] convinced
[1:31:14] that what he had was good enough
[1:31:18] he was never fully convinced that god's
[1:31:21] prophet
[1:31:22] and his message was enough to conquer
[1:31:25] every enemy every nation
[1:31:28] everything that stood between them and
[1:31:30] the promise he was not
[1:31:32] convinced that was enough so he kept the
[1:31:36] babylonian garment on
[1:31:37] standby just in case they were ever
[1:31:41] attacked and overtaken by the enemy he
[1:31:44] could go
[1:31:45] slip on a babylonian garment
[1:31:50] and spare his own life
[1:31:53] as if god wasn't strong enough
[1:31:56] to spare the lives of the believers so
[1:32:00] aiken kept a babylonian garment on
[1:32:03] standby and you say brother tim
[1:32:07] there is nobody nobody
[1:32:11] like that today all but there are
[1:32:16] there are people who come from baptists
[1:32:20] catholic uh other
[1:32:23] forms of beliefs i'm not picking on
[1:32:24] anyone i'm just saying they got
[1:32:27] something in their past
[1:32:28] and in their background that they have
[1:32:30] never fully
[1:32:32] released and they are keeping those
[1:32:35] ideas
[1:32:37] they are keeping that identification
[1:32:39] they're keeping that
[1:32:40] there as a fallback
[1:32:44] just in case something ever goes wrong
[1:32:48] with the message because they're not
[1:32:51] convinced that the message is enough
[1:32:55] so they're keeping a babylonian garment
[1:32:58] in the closet
[1:32:59] for backup or for standby but i want to
[1:33:02] tell you if that's the way you are
[1:33:04] tonight
[1:33:04] your end will be the same as aikens in
[1:33:08] because the babylonian garment could not
[1:33:10] be hid from the holy ghost
[1:33:13] amen he could have hid it from his
[1:33:15] brothers from his sisters from his wife
[1:33:17] and from his children but joshua a type
[1:33:21] of the holy ghost
[1:33:22] says wait a minute this would not be
[1:33:25] happening
[1:33:26] except there is hidden sin in the camp
[1:33:29] and he says come here and he brought
[1:33:31] every tribe in review
[1:33:33] until finally he come to achan and aiken
[1:33:36] said
[1:33:36] yes i am
[1:33:39] the costume christian
[1:33:44] i don't want to be a costumed christian
[1:33:47] today a costumed christian
[1:33:50] never has a good end
[1:33:54] i'll say this tonight the only good end
[1:33:56] of a costume
[1:33:57] christian is the altar where they repent
[1:34:01] and burn that babylonian garment and
[1:34:04] melt that golden wedge amen
[1:34:07] discard everything from your past
[1:34:10] discard
[1:34:10] everything from from how you've been
[1:34:12] taught or how you've been believed or
[1:34:14] have you been indoctrinated leave it all
[1:34:17] behind
[1:34:18] because it only brings death
[1:34:22] amen now i'm coming to my last
[1:34:26] the last type of christian and i want to
[1:34:29] read from jude
[1:34:30] chapter 1 verse 14.
[1:34:33] the bible says and enoch also the
[1:34:36] seventh from adam prophesied of these
[1:34:38] saying behold the lord cometh
[1:34:40] with ten thousands of his saints to
[1:34:42] execute
[1:34:43] judgment upon all and to convince all
[1:34:46] that are ungodly among them of all of
[1:34:48] their ungodly deeds which they have
[1:34:50] ungodly committed
[1:34:52] and all of their hard speeches which
[1:34:54] ungodly sinners
[1:34:56] have spoken against him
[1:35:00] these are murmurs complainers walking
[1:35:03] after their own lusts
[1:35:05] and their mouth speaketh great swelling
[1:35:07] words
[1:35:08] having men's persons in admiration
[1:35:11] because of advantage
[1:35:13] but beloved remember ye
[1:35:17] the words which were spoken before of
[1:35:19] the apostles of our lord jesus christ
[1:35:22] how that they told you there should be
[1:35:24] mockers in the last time
[1:35:27] who would walk should walk after their
[1:35:29] own
[1:35:30] ungodly lusts these be they who
[1:35:34] separate themselves sensual
[1:35:37] having not the spirit
[1:35:41] but ye beloved
[1:35:44] but ye beloved
[1:35:48] building up yourselves on your
[1:35:51] most holy faith praying in the holy
[1:35:55] ghost
[1:35:57] keep yourselves in the love of god
[1:36:02] looking for the mercy of our lord jesus
[1:36:05] christ
[1:36:06] unto eternal life and of some
[1:36:09] have compassion making a difference
[1:36:14] oh mice we got a lot of people who are
[1:36:17] being different and trying with
[1:36:20] everything that's in them to be
[1:36:21] different
[1:36:22] but the scripture says make a difference
[1:36:28] amen be the kind of christian
[1:36:31] that makes a difference
[1:36:36] and others save with fear
[1:36:39] pulling them out of the fire hating
[1:36:42] even the garment spotted by the flesh
[1:36:46] now unto him that is able to keep you
[1:36:48] from falling and to present you
[1:36:51] faultless before the presence of his
[1:36:53] glory with exceeding joy
[1:36:56] to the only wise god our savior be
[1:36:59] glory and majesty dominion and power
[1:37:03] both now and ever amen
[1:37:07] so the last kind of christian
[1:37:10] i want to talk to you about tonight
[1:37:13] is the contagious
[1:37:17] christian the contagious
[1:37:21] christian this is the man
[1:37:25] the woman the boy or the girl that
[1:37:29] makes a difference
[1:37:32] i do heating and air conditioning and
[1:37:34] you forgive me if you've heard me
[1:37:36] share this before i'm in the heating and
[1:37:40] air conditioning business
[1:37:41] and you know there are two things one
[1:37:45] is a thermometer
[1:37:48] and the other is a thermostat
[1:37:52] and the thermometer only
[1:37:55] tells or declares the temperature
[1:37:59] whatever the temperature of the room is
[1:38:02] or whatever the temperature it is
[1:38:03] outside
[1:38:04] that thermometer just rises or falls
[1:38:08] whatever is going on around it is what
[1:38:11] it becomes
[1:38:13] because it's a thermometer
[1:38:17] and all it does is tells
[1:38:20] the temperature then there's something
[1:38:23] called
[1:38:24] a thermostat amen
[1:38:27] and it knows what the temperature is
[1:38:32] but unlike the thermometer the
[1:38:34] thermostat
[1:38:35] is connected to a source of energy
[1:38:39] and it has a setting that can be raised
[1:38:42] or lowered and it is not
[1:38:46] controlled by the temperature but
[1:38:49] it has power to change
[1:38:52] the temperature and what i'm trying to
[1:38:55] tell you tonight
[1:38:56] is god has not called us to be
[1:38:58] thermometers
[1:39:00] laodiceans are thermometers
[1:39:03] even whatever is going on around them is
[1:39:06] what they become
[1:39:07] but god has called christians to be
[1:39:09] thermostats
[1:39:11] because you are connected to a source of
[1:39:14] energy
[1:39:15] amen and although you can recognize
[1:39:17] what's going on around you
[1:39:19] you are not controlled by what's
[1:39:22] happening around you
[1:39:24] rather you are having an impact
[1:39:27] on the circumstances around you
[1:39:31] oh brother
[1:39:34] sister amen you get a real holy ghost
[1:39:38] field thermostat christian
[1:39:40] amen they can walk into a cold
[1:39:43] formal sticky situation
[1:39:47] maybe a worship service or maybe
[1:39:50] a meeting in a home maybe maybe into a
[1:39:53] business meeting
[1:39:54] that you you can put them in almost any
[1:39:56] circumstance
[1:39:58] and they can begin changing things
[1:40:02] they begin clapping their hands they
[1:40:04] begin lifting their hands
[1:40:06] they begin worshiping god why they
[1:40:09] are not reacting to what's happening
[1:40:12] around them
[1:40:13] but they are connected to a source of
[1:40:16] energy
[1:40:17] and as he turns up the dial amen
[1:40:20] they begin to warm up the room around
[1:40:22] them
[1:40:24] oh brother i'm thinking about paul and
[1:40:26] silas
[1:40:27] when they were cast in prison that night
[1:40:30] amen
[1:40:30] instead of feeling sorry for themselves
[1:40:33] instead of saying we just be like the
[1:40:35] other prisoners
[1:40:36] we should sit here and cry and complain
[1:40:38] and moan and gripe and think about how
[1:40:41] could we be treated this way
[1:40:43] oh no they were not thermometers
[1:40:46] they were thermostats they began seeking
[1:40:49] praises to god
[1:40:50] they began shouting amen they began
[1:40:53] worshiping god
[1:40:54] hallelujah and the holy spirit came down
[1:40:58] into that prison and not only freed paul
[1:41:01] and silas
[1:41:02] but it broke the bars it broke open the
[1:41:04] doors
[1:41:05] even it brought the concrete down it
[1:41:08] freed
[1:41:09] all the prisoners and saved the jailer
[1:41:13] too
[1:41:14] oh my friend amen
[1:41:18] they put three thermostats in the fiery
[1:41:20] furnace one day
[1:41:23] they thought they could destroy them
[1:41:25] with fire
[1:41:26] but they was controlled they was
[1:41:28] connected
[1:41:29] to a source of energy and one angel said
[1:41:33] i'll go
[1:41:34] and another angel said i'll go and he
[1:41:37] said no
[1:41:38] i am the energy that is connected to
[1:41:42] shadrach meshach and abednego
[1:41:46] and jehovah genre even came down
[1:41:50] from his heavenly throne and he began to
[1:41:52] fan the flames of that fire
[1:41:54] and he began dancing he began rejoicing
[1:41:58] he began praising god they were not
[1:42:01] ashamed
[1:42:02] to be identified with me and i'm not
[1:42:05] ashamed
[1:42:06] to be identified with him hallelujah
[1:42:11] are you a contagious christian tonight
[1:42:14] are you connected to a source of energy
[1:42:18] hallelujah yes i know it's laodicea
[1:42:22] yes i know it's the end times yes i know
[1:42:24] there's a virus going around
[1:42:26] but i'm not affected by what's around me
[1:42:30] i'm connected to what's above me
[1:42:33] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:42:37] oh hallelujah
[1:42:42] they're starting fires everywhere they
[1:42:44] go
[1:42:46] amen they are fire starters
[1:42:49] they're burning embers they're alive
[1:42:53] coal off of the altar
[1:42:57] and they're glowing and they're
[1:42:59] radiating god's glory
[1:43:02] oh my amen
[1:43:06] praise the lord amen
[1:43:10] thank you jesus
[1:43:12] [Applause]
[1:43:18] this is the kind of christian the devil
[1:43:21] hates
[1:43:23] the devil can't stand this kind of
[1:43:25] christian and
[1:43:26] every demon in hell
[1:43:29] knows who the contagious christians are
[1:43:32] because every time they are given an
[1:43:34] assignment
[1:43:36] to go and tempt them torment them
[1:43:40] afflict them those demons come back
[1:43:44] having second thoughts about what side
[1:43:46] they're on
[1:43:51] they are more affected by the person
[1:43:54] they went to torment
[1:43:56] than the person is the reason they're
[1:44:00] affected
[1:44:01] is because the believer is connected
[1:44:04] amen hallelujah
[1:44:08] stephen was a contagious christian
[1:44:12] he was being stoned he was being killed
[1:44:16] his
[1:44:16] life was being exterminated but
[1:44:20] as they were trying to smother out the
[1:44:23] flame of his life
[1:44:25] it jumped
[1:44:29] like a spark from a brush fire
[1:44:33] when they stomped and they stamped
[1:44:36] the fire leaped over
[1:44:39] to a man by the name of saul
[1:44:43] and he had been around powerful
[1:44:46] influences
[1:44:48] he had been groomed and had been raised
[1:44:51] and had been exposed his whole life
[1:44:53] was in a vein to become something but in
[1:44:56] this
[1:44:56] burning christian by the name of stephen
[1:45:00] his death had a greater
[1:45:03] impact on saul's life
[1:45:07] than everything that had ever happened
[1:45:09] to him
[1:45:11] up until that time that's a contagious
[1:45:14] christian
[1:45:16] i'm coming to a close but let me just
[1:45:17] share a few things with you if i made
[1:45:19] this all right
[1:45:21] in the book of revelation john
[1:45:24] turned to see the voice that spoke with
[1:45:28] him and when he turned he saw
[1:45:31] seven golden candle sticks or lamp
[1:45:34] stands and the prophet of god picks this
[1:45:35] up
[1:45:36] and he says now what is the candlestick
[1:45:39] it's a lamp stand
[1:45:41] and notice how beautiful when he turned
[1:45:43] to sea
[1:45:44] or when he turned he saw this one like
[1:45:46] the son of man standing here
[1:45:48] in the midst of the seven golden
[1:45:49] lampstands which means
[1:45:51] seven church ages to come and each
[1:45:54] lampstand hooked into the main
[1:45:57] big oil sensor and
[1:46:01] in this oil come forth up to a little
[1:46:03] odd-shaped lamp that set with a wick in
[1:46:05] it
[1:46:06] and the wick hung down into the oil
[1:46:11] they poured oil into the top of the
[1:46:13] stand which filled up the big main stem
[1:46:15] and the big branch and it ran out into
[1:46:17] the stems like this
[1:46:19] and the lamp with the wick hanging down
[1:46:22] this pipe
[1:46:23] kept burning day and night
[1:46:28] you never had to light it it never went
[1:46:31] out
[1:46:32] they just kept pouring oil in the main
[1:46:36] pipe and these lampstands that come out
[1:46:38] like this
[1:46:39] had the lamp sitting on top of them the
[1:46:41] wick from the lamp run down into here
[1:46:42] got its life out of here
[1:46:44] oh what different it is from a candle
[1:46:47] you see a candle is just wax with a wick
[1:46:50] in the middle and once it
[1:46:52] burns down it's over but a
[1:46:55] lamp stand amen it's everlasting
[1:47:00] the fire is always burning because the
[1:47:02] wick is dipped in the oil
[1:47:03] and it's drawing the energy from that
[1:47:06] oil
[1:47:07] and it's turning liquid into light
[1:47:12] amen it's turning liquid into light
[1:47:16] it's turning oil into a power that can
[1:47:18] illuminate
[1:47:20] and can radiate and warm amen it's how
[1:47:22] you turn the word of god
[1:47:24] into action i mean others can read that
[1:47:27] word but it means nothing to them but
[1:47:29] when your life is dipped into it
[1:47:31] you change it amen it converts the
[1:47:33] energy into something that can give
[1:47:35] light
[1:47:36] and warmth and healing and salvation and
[1:47:38] deliverance
[1:47:40] you see now these lamp stands the fire
[1:47:43] that was on these lampstands in the old
[1:47:45] testament when they lit one lamp
[1:47:48] they could not light the next lamp with
[1:47:51] the same fire they had in their hand
[1:47:54] they lit one lamp then picked it
[1:47:57] up and lit the other lamp
[1:48:01] and then set it down and lift this lamp
[1:48:05] and then took and lit this lamp
[1:48:07] with the same fire that they had
[1:48:11] at the beginning oh i hope it don't go
[1:48:15] over your head
[1:48:16] jesus christ the same yesterday today
[1:48:19] and forever
[1:48:20] the same fire holy ghost split every one
[1:48:23] of those churches
[1:48:24] right down through the ages
[1:48:28] so the fire that has quickened you
[1:48:31] tonight
[1:48:32] the fire that has let you amen is not a
[1:48:35] different fire
[1:48:37] it's not your pastor's fire it's not
[1:48:40] your parents fire
[1:48:42] it's not the prophet's fire but it's the
[1:48:44] same
[1:48:45] fire that fell on the day of pentecost
[1:48:48] and it has been passed from believer
[1:48:50] to believer to believer to believer even
[1:48:53] from
[1:48:53] saul to the apostle paul from stephen to
[1:48:56] the apostle paul
[1:48:58] and on down our radius amen on and on
[1:49:01] columba martin amen all the way down
[1:49:05] through this
[1:49:05] age amen you didn't get the fire of the
[1:49:08] prophet
[1:49:09] you got to fire the holy ghost amen the
[1:49:12] same fire
[1:49:13] that lit the prophet hallelujah
[1:49:17] oh my these
[1:49:21] lampstands all fit into one great big
[1:49:23] bowl
[1:49:24] one great big holder seven different
[1:49:26] lamp holders come out of it
[1:49:28] and when they did each one of those
[1:49:29] lights was drawing
[1:49:31] from the main resource of its life
[1:49:34] and its light was because it had its
[1:49:37] candle
[1:49:38] dipped down into this main barrel oh
[1:49:41] what a beautiful picture of one of those
[1:49:44] seven stars
[1:49:45] it represented with his light on fire
[1:49:48] with the holy ghost
[1:49:50] by faith he's burning with the holy
[1:49:53] ghost
[1:49:54] and his life is a candle or not a candle
[1:49:57] but a wick that's dipped into the holy
[1:49:59] spirit
[1:50:00] into christ and through that wick
[1:50:04] he's drawing the life of god
[1:50:07] out to give light to his
[1:50:10] church oh what a
[1:50:13] picture of the true believer
[1:50:19] now that's key because brother branham
[1:50:22] wasn't making this
[1:50:23] exclusive to the messengers
[1:50:26] but he's saying oh what a picture
[1:50:30] of the true believer
[1:50:33] what kind of a light is he giving the
[1:50:36] same kind of light
[1:50:38] that was when the first scandal was lit
[1:50:41] well no wonder jesus told them terry in
[1:50:43] jerusalem
[1:50:44] until you be endured with power from
[1:50:46] moon high

[1:50:56] started it was ephesus
[1:50:58] paul the angel of that church one of the
[1:51:01] stars

[1:51:04] angels seven messengers
[1:51:05] this week i can take the scripture in
[1:51:07] the history and prove to you each one of
[1:51:09] those
[1:51:10] are true in each angel and every angel
[1:51:13] had the same light
[1:51:16] that's right and then right between
[1:51:17] those ages that great one to come

[2:07:24] is crying he's crying for the living god
[2:07:30] this is a masterpiece tonight
[2:07:33] it is not just a message
[2:07:37] to get intellectually but it's actually
[2:07:40] the moving
[2:07:41] of the holy spirit amen
[2:07:45] this brother brother tim cross
[2:07:49] was supposed to be preaching for us last
[2:07:52] wednesday
[2:07:55] and for some reason
[2:07:58] we have to schedule this wednesday
[2:08:02] and i believe he didn't know what was
[2:08:04] preached here on sunday
[2:08:07] when the holy spirit spoke to us how we
[2:08:10] came out
[2:08:11] from the wilderness of sin
[2:08:14] and somewhere in dhaka where god has
[2:08:18] been knocking
[2:08:19] to your heart trying to get access to
[2:08:22] the inner men
[2:08:24] and some accepted it they got baptized
[2:08:27] and they moved from dovka to alosh
[2:08:30] when you become part of a congregation
[2:08:33] part of a church
[2:08:35] part of a fellowship but still
[2:08:38] you have not drunk from the rock yet
[2:08:43] and the holy spirit was moving toward
[2:08:46] referendum
[2:08:47] which means rest or a resting place
[2:08:52] a rest for your soul because christ
[2:08:56] said that come unto me ye that are
[2:08:59] laboring
[2:09:00] and i'm gonna give you rest to your soul
[2:09:03] and we stopped right there on sunday and
[2:09:06] we went home
[2:09:08] and the message that was supposed to be
[2:09:11] given
[2:09:11] last wednesday god arranged
[2:09:16] to be given this wednesday and god is
[2:09:19] giving you
[2:09:20] an opportunity even those that are
[2:09:23] online
[2:09:25] god is giving you probably a second
[2:09:28] or the last chance before the rapture
[2:09:33] to give you an opportunity to get the
[2:09:36] holy ghost
[2:09:38] amen the holy spirit stopped me a
[2:09:41] referendum
[2:09:42] just say rest don't explain anything
[2:09:46] because i need to clean up certain
[2:09:49] things
[2:09:50] in the midst of the people and he came
[2:09:53] tonight
[2:09:55] and he spoke and what he spoke he said
[2:09:58] there are
[2:09:59] certain christians that are
[2:10:02] in alice you are in a congregation
[2:10:06] maybe you were born in a messy church
[2:10:09] maybe you came like rachel you stole
[2:10:13] others from your father and you were
[2:10:16] bringing this
[2:10:17] adult toward the promised land you were
[2:10:20] keeping that babylonian garment
[2:10:23] bringing that up toward the message and
[2:10:25] trying to keep it
[2:10:27] as a plan b in the message
[2:10:30] and the holy spirit spoke and said if
[2:10:33] you
[2:10:33] are in the stage of a casual christian
[2:10:37] a christian that is a shame of the
[2:10:40] gospel
[2:10:42] you need to make sure your heart is good
[2:10:46] and you get into a serious prayer with
[2:10:49] god
[2:10:51] these prophecies are not things to be
[2:10:53] just talk about where we just rejoice
[2:10:57] talk about it and then tomorrow we
[2:11:00] forget about it
[2:11:01] it become a history it is telling you
[2:11:04] that the time is ahead and god
[2:11:07] is giving another opportunity telling
[2:11:10] you if you are
[2:11:11] a christian christian stop what you're
[2:11:14] doing
[2:11:16] refocus your life this church
[2:11:19] is not a continuation of the old church
[2:11:23] we came out of
[2:11:25] no that's why the holy spirit wants to
[2:11:27] clean up
[2:11:29] amen some of you are custom christian
[2:11:33] amen and all of them ended up wrong
[2:11:37] being killed in the bottom amen
[2:11:41] you cannot hide from the holy spirit you
[2:11:44] cannot be a christian
[2:11:45] and play out sometimes it shock me
[2:11:49] when i see things that people are
[2:11:51] posting
[2:11:53] they can be quiet here in church they
[2:11:56] can be fine here in church
[2:11:58] and they're always posting stuff whether
[2:12:01] it's on facebook
[2:12:02] whether it's on whatsapp and you read
[2:12:05] even the words
[2:12:07] and the terminology they are using those
[2:12:10] terminology are found in a hip-hop star
[2:12:14] in the stars of the world and the
[2:12:17] christians
[2:12:18] are putting them on facebook on whatsapp
[2:12:22] keep posting things sometimes you wonder
[2:12:25] what is the purpose of what you're
[2:12:27] posting
[2:12:28] what is the message that you're posting
[2:12:30] what are you reflecting by your posting
[2:12:33] can somebody look at your posting
[2:12:36] and detect your faith amen
[2:12:40] then on sunday we are christian then
[2:12:43] when we preach here
