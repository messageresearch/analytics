tim you are home feel home and pull as much as you can amen all right how good is my car how good [Music] how good is my car hallelujah [Music] god bless you this morning i pray that you're doing well i'm not much of a singer but this song has been kind of on my heart in the last i don't know a month or so so if you know what you can sing it just the first verse with me you know he's never promised it's an easy battle dude he never promised that the cross would not get heavy he never said that the eel would not [Music] you would not be hard [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] our heavenly father we come to you this morning we want to say thank you for your mercy lord and for your grace [Music] lord we stand and tremble [Music] brought these pigs together lord look around [Music] we're getting [Music] is [Music] foreign [Music] in the name of the lord [Music] that's the way i see this thing it's a family it's not one church versus another church you know i believe you can be a living breathing denomination and set in the church said in a message church and be a one man or one-woman denomination because denominationalism is a spirit and that's what comes in crosses division and it's what happens is is i've been dealing with this at the church when you take the text of the word and you apply your context or your understanding to it there's only one context i know that's accurate and that's given by our heavenly father that's given by the holy ghost so we're we're one family this morning can you say man where what there's one lord one faith one baptism and there's one body but yet there's many members in that body can you say amen romans chapter 8 and verse 28 through 31 very familiar portion of scripture i would like to bring greetings from the little church up in the hickory area hildebrand longview it's kind of right there on the border between the counties i thought maybe we would have some more but they're having church this morning and um i wasn't sure about your seating brother stephen said you can handle some but yeah if you almost got enough room i almost just shut it down and said well we're not having church this morning we're going to we're going down to gastonia but we believe that god is in control of everything can you say that can you say amen to that can you say that god is in control of my life he's god in the good times he's god in the bad times he's god when you think he's not god he's still god it's irrelevant to what i think and what you think see god's not interested in we it's one-on-one individual affair can you say amen romans chapter 8 and verse 28 it's a very familiar portion of scripture says and we what know that all things work together for good to them that do what how many of you love god this morning not not just in imagination but how many of you really love him this morning so this is you that he's talking to that love god to them who what call according to what your purpose the pastor's purpose the prophet's purpose no no no no to his purpose his purpose for whom he did what for no he also did what predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many brethren moreover whom he did predestinate them he also did what called and whom he called he also did what so who's justified this morning who's justified this morning amen now i want you to hear i want you to tell me who's justified this morning oh there we go i am justified it's got to become personal and he in whom he justified them he also glorified watch this what shall we say then to these things if god before us who who can be against us who can be against you this morning you say you don't know what i'm going through he knows what you're going through and he still says who can be against you because i'm for you can you say amen may the lord add the blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated it feels uh it feels a little oily in here this morning the the the great oiler the great mechanic has come down and he's dropped some oil into the the gears and he's lubing them up this morning and i if you come to calf church i come to have church and god's always here to have church can you say amen i want to take a title this morning and it might seem just a little odd i have never thought about this before in my life brother stephen asked me if i would come and i said i'll pray about it i want to make sure that it was the will of god because i'm a pastor and i know what god's called me to do he's not called me to evangelize the world he's not called me to go missionary to the world he's called me to be a pastor and i want to remain in that calling but i do believe that there are times that god will permit and for whatever reason he let you go and i prayed and i felt led and but not until yesterday morning i was sitting at the house and i was about as blank as that screen right there what do i do what what do i say this morning realizing i can't say it anyway i can't make you see it i can't make you experience it that it's going to take god himself no man can give it to you and when he gives it to you no man can take the thing away from you can you say amen that's what i love about this thing that's what i love about what we call the message and what we the scriptures you see the message is a person the message is jesus christ personally revealed to you for your day whatever he was back then he is today and what he is today he will be tomorrow that's not a collective revelation that's not something that you can say well we believe together no you have to say i believe this myself see i'll go with him alone if nobody else is willing to go i'll go with him no matter what heartache comes my way because it's not between you and me it's between me and the one who has came down and revealed himself to me and has took my name from the roll and give me my name and told me your name was laying there and i finally had to accept it so it's not between me and anybody else you can't tell me it's not true and expect me to believe it why because i met the message see the message the message is not something that's on it's not letters on on a page that's the text but the contest i still have the same word i still have the same power he's going to have a church without spot and without blemish and there is nothing there is nothing i said there is nothing or no one can stop that church from coming forth because he has called and you will surely answer [Music] you will answer because nobody put it in you and nobody can reach down and take it out it took me a while to figure that one out it ain't between me and somebody else it ain't being between me and the pastor it ain't between me and brother brahm it's between me and god and god alone he said who do you say that i the son of man or who do men say that i am they said well some say you're elias some say you're this some say you're that he said but i want to know who do you say that i am see it's a personal intimate walk between you and god nothing more nothing less it ain't going to work and now god's coming down to the end time and he's stripping everything away from you he's bringing you out of your comfort zone mama eagle's going down and she's getting the fur out and she's throwing the fur over the side of the nest and you're feeling the stickers and you're like what's going on right now mama says hey it's time to fly it's time to fly i can't let you fly this morning but he can he can let you soar above your troubles this morning he can let you soar above your heartache this morning why because he can take you through the fire he can take you through the storm why because he is the author of it but god's not the author of confusion but he permits it he permits it he permits it so you'll see who he is you know you know what i believe about the seals being revealed seals revealed jesus christ but when they revealed christ guess who else it revealed [Music] ah somebody's done catching the revelation so when the seven seals was preached who was it preached about because there was a book and when the book was given up and it was opened it revealed some names that was laying inside because it be beating the book of redemption and his wife did not know who she is just like the 144 000 do not yet know who they are but he knows who they are [Applause] and you're like that's me i see that now that's me and god uses so many things to get you to see him so he can show you who you are [Music] some of you thought you would never be sitting here today you were comfortable well i want to bring a thought to you if god will permit it this morning called the blessing of betrayal never thought about it like this until yesterday morning every one of us have experienced that in our lives in our family and our homes and our workplaces but i want you to think about the word betray means to expose one's country group or a person to an enemy treacherously reveal secrets of information be disloyal to and the word betrayal also means destroy and trust i don't know what you've been trusting in but if you've been trusting anything other than jesus christ he's going to let whatever he has to to destroy your trust and puts your trust where it belongs you can't put your trust in me i will let you down you can't put your trust in your husband so far somewhere he will let you down he might be just as faithful and never have an issue with another woman but somewhere along the line he will let you down your wife will let you down you know why because god says i david says it like this in the book of psalms he said when my mother and my father have forsaken me he said he knew one that would take him up it wasn't the king saul it was the army it wasn't his wives he said but the lord will take me up why because he knew david's name long after david was gone off the scene and other kings had come up on succession and because they did right he said because of your father david he had respect unto david why because he knew who david was he knew david trusted him with his whole heart david had many problems david had many betrayals many betrayals he had many disappointments he had many discouragements in his life he wanted to quit he didn't know if he was called anymore i don't know if i'm called to this thing you got to ask yourself are you called to it if you ain't guess what oh they can be shaken we'll be shaken our whole world's shaken can you say amen i want you to think about this for just a moment isaiah being a prophet of god according to the scripture he had his eyes on something he should have never fastened his eyes upon him he had a dear friend in his life that took care of him that whatever he asked for and god said your eyes are fastened on the wrong thing isaiah your eyes are fast enough i wonder how many times god may have come down and said hey as high isaiah what are you really looking at you know if i'm down he'll come down in the subtlety of things and say hey what are you looking at what are you looking at this morning what are you looking at wednesday night what are you looking at when you're home and we think well that's just my thoughts no god's coming down and saying what are you looking at isaiah what is it you're looking at well i go to church i pay my tithes i pay my offerings god what are you asking of me he says i want to know what you're looking at and all of a sudden here uzziah god just takes him right off the scene and this is what god showed me that the betrayal that isaiah felt in uzziah's death revealed what he was really dependent on isaiah's betrayal what he felt in his heart now caused him to look at god in a way that he had never looked at him before he made him examine some things a little different can you say amen he looked at god in a way he had never looked at him before now watch this the betrayal released isaiah the blessing of betrayal the betrayal released isaiah to serve god in a way that he had never served god before there are so many things that comes into our lives and we'll just hold on to them and we think it's good and we think it's a blessing of god but it's betraying who you are and god will come down and begin to cut that thing out of your life and you're like but i don't want this to go but god said but i am what you need well i feel betrayed when god took that away he said because that betrayed me so the betrayal in isaiah's life caused him to be able to serve god in a capacity that he never could serving before [Music] because he had his eyes on the wrong thing the blessing of betrayal do you know what isaiah's problem was he had a stolen identity [Music] he assumed the king's identity i'm a friend of the king [Music] everywhere he went he was associated with the king but the problem was he was associated with the wrong king he had the wrong association god said hey you're putting that king in my place son i'm going to bring a blessing into your life and it's going to be called betrayal i'm going to let betrayal come into your life daughter so that i can give you a blessing through betrayal because his identity was in king uzziah and not in king jehovah oh my my message is the identity what is the message then see you might have an intellectual idea brother brahm said you can learn this message that we're trying to teach well i have received the word for my day you ain't received nothing until you're born again you ain't received nothing till you found an altar and something died out and something took over you're just going through the motions and then god lets things get shook up so you know what you can experience betrayal so your job can be your identity your career can be your identity your pastor can be your identity well brother branham is my identity [Music] wrong identity in all of it your identity is jesus christ in christ alone because what did my prophet come when he preached me he never preached himself he preached to me lord let me dress up a bride and i hear him i'm saying eleazar tell me a little bit more about him what does he really look like and he said always thinking about you he wants me to tell you that your flesh of his flesh and bone of his bone that's the identity that you've got to have you are a flesh of his flesh you are born of his bone matter of fact you are life of his life you are nature of his nature you don't have you can crawl around on the floor and you can bark like a dog but you ain't gonna be a very good imitation why because the nature of a dog is not in you the nature of a human being is in you and if that nature of jesus christ the same one that was in the prophet if that same nature lays inside of you you will do the works of jesus christ there is nothing that can stop it i've heard them say well we don't believe in the gifts no more that the days of miracles has passed and we don't do this and don't do that and i go finding the message where god never took them out do you realize that many times church order has got in the way of you having church well it says this and it says that and it says this and it says that but he also turns around and says but if the spirit's moving we want to keep the spirit moving [Applause] can you say amen the blessing of betrayal coming into your life oh we've all experienced it we've all struggled with it but i want you to understand something blessing is god's deliverance to his children because it refocuses you you know i spent six days in the hospital seven battled at home and six days in the hospital with cobot you know what that was to me a blessing because laying flat on my back i couldn't move so sick i couldn't pick the covers that when i was holding cold in the hospital to cover my body so sick i wanted god to just take me on home i said i know you can heal me but if you ain't gonna touch me i'm ready to go there came his presence into the room he never said a word he just wanted me to know i will never leave you nor will i forsake you but i'll be with you even in you to the end of the age you know what it was a blessing because you know why i didn't realize it but i had lost the joy of my salvation the preacher can look oh yes he's a man just like you are he's got the same battles the same same mind problems the same flesh to overcome as you've got see your problem is is when you elevate a man to a position he should have never should have never ever been elevated to in the first place hello hello isaac uzziah was a problem and i'm putting it this way anything that's a problem on a personal level to you god will destroy the idol god will take it down god will take it out of your life because he is going to have a preeminence in your life he's going to rule and reign upon the throne of your heart because everything that he said about that wife she has to become she is the one that's spotless she is the one that without wrinkle she is the one that is without blemish but watch this he said but she hath made she had done a part she has made herself ready he said when she goes to dropping herself when she goes to dropping herself back in line with the word when you can't see it's in your way god has to come along and take it out and then you have to drop yourself back in line with the word of god he said watch the message then or watch the scriptures he said there will be a message that'll sweep out and catch her it's not a different message it's not another message coming what it was it was the same message because the word has never changed it was the same message but your eyes were else where can you say amen betrayal to isaiah was a blessing watch this isaiah 6 8 said also i heard the voice of the lord saying who shall i send and who will go for us but before that he said oh woe is me a man of unclean lips because you know why uzziah had got in the way what's in your way this morning what is in your way this morning god's taking it all away from you you got to learn to trust him you have to learn to have a hundred percent trust he's still god when the bank accounts full but he's also still god when the bank accounts see there are two times in your life that you should praise god when you feel like it and when you don't feel like it he is worthy to be praised no matter what the god of the mountain is still the god of the valley the god of no family problems is still the god in the family problems he's not changed he's just allowed things to come in to refocus why because our focus gets out of line our focus gets out of shift but isaiah comes down when he reshifted when god had let this now notice he had to come when god shifted his focus he had to come and say god i was looking at the wrong thing i'd made the heart of worship about something that it was not supposed to be brother luke you can never wear that song out for me you can never because you know what that was pinned from the hand of god inspiration from god himself into the hands of an individual who understood i've made it something other than what it should be made [Applause] hello now he said then said i hear am i send me when the betrayal comes is it accepted as a blessing or is it accepted as a curse what i found is i don't know nothing and the less i think i know when things do arise my reaction can be just a little different but if i've got it figured out and it's going in the direction i think it should be and i'm holding on with both hands i might be holding on to two things that i shouldn't be holding on to and god says wait a minute what are you doing son well god i'm serving you he said no you're not he said you want to serve me but you still holding on to something you shouldn't be holding on to now i want you to turn it loose you got uh no god no you need to turn it loose son no no papa i'm happy where i'm at no turn it loose okay you won't turn it loose i know how to make you turn it loose that's one thing i found out i'm not going to tell god no for nothing because he knows how to put me through the mud he knows how to drag me through the not whole bent over backwards to get my attention and now i'm saying okay i don't even know what you want me to do anymore he says now we're the place where you and i can talk see i don't know about you but i believe god can talk to you oh well that was for another day no no no no he's not the god of history i can read about the god of history see if the message is locked up here he's a god of history but if the message here he's god on the scene see i still believe that everything he did back then he does today if i can't make it happen i'm not going to stand in your way if you've got enough faith to make it happen why because he says serve me with everything thou shalt have no other what not god but god's uh plural be for me hear o israel for the lord your god is what one god gods so here you know what i found in the in in a betrayal whether it's a blessing or whether it's a curse it's taken me some hard times to understand this scripture they aren't snared with the words of thy mouth thou art snared with the words of thy mouth they are taken with the words of thy mouth so i want you to understand something your words determine a lot when a betrayal comes how many of you it's been going good at work and everything's going good and they come in with no hesitation with no warning and they give you the pink slip well what did i do nothing god said hey i got something else i want you to do oh but i had it figured out i know i don't have nothing figured out anymore i don't have anything figured out you know why because i'm looking at the turmoil that's in the world right now in the united states and i see what the prophet said they will be completely insane before the coming of the lord we are you are living in prophecy it's no longer foretelling of the future you are living in it right now and it's creeping into the churches and trying to get this one again trying to get you to sign against this if you ain't in this world you ain't gonna side for nothing but jesus christ we are all one in him right i don't care if you're red if you're yellow if you're black if i need a blood transfusion i'm going to take it from you you understand what i'm saying i'm going to take your blood because i want to live and i know of one transfusion that would fix all the problems in the united states right now [Applause] listen it ain't a race problem in the u.s it's a heart problem because my bible tells me this it's not what goes into a man's mouth that comes out in the draw but it's what proceedeth forth from a man's heart that's what defiles him you ever seen two drunks together sloppy drinking their arms around one another they loving one another before they may be ready to kill one another because what they got some spirits in them and they got into a different spirit listen if you realize that you can't go along with that out there and you can't go along with the false side of stuff that only leaves one place for you one place and one place only i told the church i said look it's the process of elimination is what brings you the revelation oh well that's intellectualism brother tim well i found out i can't walk away from this thing i can't do it i've been tempted to i've been tempted to and i realized i don't belong in this world i'm a u.s citizen by birth naturally but something died in the side and something else took over and i realized i don't this this world is not my home anymore so guess where that leaves me by the process of elimination the revelation is broken in my life i'm ready to go i'm ready to leave this whole world and see i realize i can't take myself out i realize because it's getting closer and closer and tighter and tighter and if you hadn't figured it out the squeeze has already started it's already started while i'm waiting for the churches out there to do this if you don't feel the pressure right now maybe there's nothing on the inside for you to feel it you know what it is it's not the pressure out there that's pushing in it's the pressure on the inside of you pushing back as it comes in do you know why it's pressurizing on the inside so you don't explode and you don't go crazy but god brings betrayals into your life to point you in the right direction he brings them into your life and you're like well that makes me real uncomfortable good because that means you can grow now you can come out of your level of complacency this is what i found this is my personal revelation this morning because it's my personal walk with jesus christ betrayal strips away the unimportant things in a person's life revealing the true relevance of the big picture how many of you thought this thing was about you and then you figured it out it ain't he says it's about me but then he turns this oh by the way it's also about you but you couldn't realize it was about you until you seen it was about me first the bigger picture when betrayal comes it begins to strip away the the relevant the unrelevant the unimportant things so that you can see the bigger picture so that you can really see god and i want to look by god's grace for a few minutes this morning that a man who was chosen of god chosen of god he was called of god he was a gifted man and we see in his life that the gifts and callings are without repentance but those things always cause disturbances in good and evil do you realize if you have the holy ghost and you walk into walmart amongst a bunch of unbelievers there is a disturbance when you walk through the doors you sisters with your long hair and your godly dress when you walk into a bunch of uns believers there's a battle that's going on because that says that woman is looking and she says you know that's something about that kind of looks right to me but that thing that's sitting up on our shoulder says ah you don't want to look like that you're going to be made fun of you you cause a disturbance when you walk in a place with the holy ghost when you walk around you are causing the disturbance you know what you know why the pressure's coming because they're saying you don't belong here anymore and you've got to get to a point to where you say oh but i do you got a good point say you're right i don't belong here anymore god's letting betrayal come every from every angle he's letting it come from everywhere i want to look at joseph for just a few minutes and we'll look at some scriptures and i want to see in joseph's life how the betrayal was a blessing to joseph [Music] joseph was minding his own business he was doing what god had called him to do in other words he was going to church service after church service after church service he was being faithful and then there was a major disruption come in his life he dressed right he looked right genesis 37 verse 18 it says when they saw him afar off even before he came near unto them you see why i say you cause a disturbance when you walk in somewhere they conspired against him you walk into a restaurant with the holy ghost and everybody that's got the devil all over them the devils are starting to put thoughts in their head and they're conspiring against you they're conspiring against you in the workplace don't worry about it you can't lose your job until god says it's time to go elsewhere he'll make that business prosperous just for your sake he'll i said he'll make that place you work prosperous for your sake you know why because i've got an example in the bible the spin of prosperity we'll see in a minute through a betrayal was put in a very difficult situation that he himself didn't know how to handle he didn't know what to do with it but it wasn't his betrayal i got betrayed no you didn't no you didn't that was god's gift to you [Music] that was god's gift to you isaiah so you could set your eyes all right so you can say oh god here am i send me send me where wherever he sends you to and they conspired against him to slay him and they said to one another behold this dreamer cometh come now therefore let us slay him and cast him into some pit and we'll say some evil beast hath devoured him we will see what will become of his dreams and reuben heard it and he delivered him out of their hands and said let us not kill him and reuben said unto them shed no blood but cast him into a pit that is in the wilderness and lay no hand upon him that he might that he might rid him out of their hands and deliver him to his father again so somebody had some good common sense but you know what if he could have delivered him from his brothers with his good common sense he would have got in the way of god he would have got in reuben would have got in the way of god and it came to pass verse 23 when joseph was coming to his brethren that they stripped joseph out of his coat well what'd you take my coat for that ain't too bad oh you ain't seen nothing yet about what we're getting ready to do to you they stripped him out of his coat the bible says his coat of many colors that was on him and they took him and they cast him into a pit and the pit was empty and there was no water in it and he sat down and they sat down to eat bread and they lifted up their eyes and looked and behold a company of ishmaelites came from gilead with her camels bearing spicery bomb and bomb and myrrh and going to carried into egypt and judah said unto his brother what prophet is there if we slay our brother and conceal his blood come let us sell him to the ishmaelites and let our not our hand be upon him for he is our brother and our flesh and his brethren were content then they're passed by midianites merchant merchant men and they drew and lifted up joseph out of the pit and sold joseph to the ishmaelites for 20 pieces of silver and they brought joseph into egypt what a betrayal of his own household and we know that all things work together for the good of them so you might as well get happy you might as well quit being sad you might as well just go ahead and let's say god if i got something on me shake it off because i know it's all working for my good notice he not said for your glory he said for my glory but it will be for your good amen and we know that all things work together for the good of them that love god who are called and joseph was called for a purpose but see it didn't go the way joseph thought it should have went he was on his way down to take care of his brothers and we know that all things work together genesis 39 1-6 and joseph was brought to egypt and potiphar an officer of pharaoh the captain of the guard an egyptian brought him bought him of the hands of the ishmaelites which had bought brought him down thither and and the lord was with joseph where was he with joseph in the betrayal you know why he had to be with him because one day he was going to have a new testament author pen it says i will never leave you nor will i forsake you he couldn't have a word without an example to go with it think about it let it sink in for just a minute and the lord was with joseph and he was a prosperous man and he was in the house of his master the egyptian and his master saw that the lord was with him that the lord had made all that he did to prosper in his hand and joseph found grace in his sight and he served him and he made him oversee over his house and all that he had put into his hand and it came to pass from the time that he had made him oversee in the house and over all that he had the lord blessed you see why i said god will make you until he's through with you in that workplace he will make that place prosperous and you enjoy the prosperity and it always is the blessings of god and he said yeah but i got something else for you to do and you're like but god this is your blessings he said yes but i've got to give you something else the lord blessed the egyptians house for joseph's sake and the blessing of the lord was upon all that he had in the house and in the field and all he left that he had in joseph's hand and he knew not all he had he had so much trust in his man he didn't know what he had saved the bread which he did eat and joseph was a goodly person and well favored but watch this and we know that all things all things can you say all things all things i said all things you've got to get that see if you're in my mind say well i don't know if you're thinking about a particular situation i don't know how this is good for me he said all things see god's not interested in your thoughts he didn't consult you when he wrote the word of god [Music] he just said be you transformed by the renewing of your mind by his word we are transformed not what i think about the word not what my context says about the word but what he says about the word genesis 39 7 through 20 and it came to pass after these things that his master's wife cast her eyes upon jehovah's joseph and she said lie with me but he refused and said unto his master's wife behold my master whateth not what is with me in in the house and he hath committed all that he hath into my hand there is none greater in the house than i neither hath he kept back anything from me but thee because thou art his wife how can then i do this great wickedness and sin against god joseph had his feelings in the betrayal but i can't find where he ever got bitter hello somebody i cannot find one time where joseph got bitter in the betrayal bitterness will take every bit of the joy out of your life bitterness will rob you of your victory bitterness will bring sickness into the home bitterness will cause your family to fall apart but you don't know what i've been through you don't know what my experiences does but god knows what your experiences is and he permitted it for your good. oh yes he did you realize that's not easy when you're in the midst of it to say that you don't want to say it because you don't feel it but i've been figured out my feelings lie to me every day of my life my thoughts lie to me every day of my life they can see some fabric of my imaginations that's not even according to god's plan for my life that's not even according to his word and i have to come and line myself back up with this and say okay god here am i and it came to pass about this time that joseph went into the house to do his business and there was none of the men of the house there within and she caught him by his garment saying lie with me and he left his garment in his hand and fled and got him out and it came to pass when she saw that he had left his garment in her hand and was fled forth then she called into the men of her house and spake unto him saying you ever had somebody lie on you that's one of the worst betrayals that you'll ever experience in your life you know why because the betrayal cannot happen unless there's a great form of trust oh i trusted that person you know what you forgot that they were a human being born in sin shape and iniquity may be converted on the inside but the outside ain't never gonna be converted and if it wasn't for the holy ghost control in your life who knows where you would be where would i be well i can think of a few places i should be without the grace of god but i can see grace in my life in a way that just it humbles me it melts me you realize you'll betray yourself because you've got confidence in you that i'll do this and i'll do that and i'll do this and god says hey i got news for you you are depending upon you and i want you to depend upon me he never said you will lead yourself and guide you he said i will lead you and guide you into all truth you know what he does he leads you into the truth that you can't do it on your own he leads you into the truth that you can't depend on somebody else see we've had too much preacher religion we've had too much covering i i don't care if if a man comes up here if i was in this church and he comes up here and he preaches his first sermon i'm not going to dissect him and say well i wonder what he's going to no i come and say god here am i what i need something from you god do you realize you got problems in your life that you don't even know that you got and god has to let satan come into it so he can deliver you from it you know why because we're all all right in our own eyes every man seemeth right in his own cause until his neighbor come and searcheth him out the bible says my neighbor is the holy ghost he searches me all the time and i've quit fighting searching me because i had somebody say there's going to be a bride she'll be the final voice to the final age that don't mean that she's going to be preaching it she might just be living your life speaks louder than any sermon that can ever be preached can you say amen a lived life brother brahm said is the thunder that shakes the devil oh you can talk it all you want but when you begin to live it he starts to shake just a little bit he starts to quiver he sees you start going and start living he says i need to watch that but you know i still got time but when something is dropped down on the inside of the anchor you might slip every once in a while but he sees you get back up and he says i am in trouble now because i know the message better than he or she does i've heard it preached i was there when the prophet preached i was in every meeting that was preached and i know it better than they do but i got news for him he can't live it and he can't make you stop from living it when the giver the message itself steps down on the inside there's nothing he can do to stop you from living it why because the message the person becomes alive in a body of flesh one more time that's exactly right and it came to pass when he heard that i lifted up my voice and cried this is her and he left his garment with me and fled and got him out and she laid up his garment by her until his lord came home and she spoke to him according to these words saying the hebrew servant which thou has brought unto us came in to mock me and it came to pass as i lifted up my voice and cried that he left his garment with me and fled out and he came to pass when his master heard the words of his wife and it came to pass that when the master heard the words of his wife he took her word for something that his eyes should have told him was completely different if that wife can move her husband with a lie how much more can the queen of heaven move her husband with her words you see god's revealing who you are you didn't know that you could stand the test you didn't know you could stand when others walk away we've been doing too much of this good to see you brother god bless you brother god says hey who are you leaning on who you leaning on are you leaning on the arm of flesh no no man after the flesh but the spirit no man after the flesh and it came to pass when his master heard the words of his wife which she spake unto him saying see he didn't go down and see if the report's true he didn't go talk to joseph about it he just took someone else's word for it and acted upon it because you know what he had trust in her and it sounded good besides he's a slave i can't trust him anyway not understanding that his savior was standing in his midst i'll show you in just a minute after this manner did my servant to me and his and this kindled his wrath and joseph's master took him and put him in the prison a place where the king's prisoners were bound and there he was in prison and we know that all things work together for the good of them who love god who are called according to his purpose genesis 40 1-5 and then verse 23 and it came to pass that after the butler of the king of egypt and his baker had offended their lord the king of egypt and pharaoh was wroth against two of his officers against the chief of the butlers and against the chief of the bakers and he put them in the ward in the house of the captain of the guard into the prison the place where joseph was bound do you realize that that offense that those two caused their king never happened until joseph was in place there is nothing that can befall you no betrayal can come no heartache no trial but god is already there to let you experience it but because he's jehovah's summer the lord is there that when you get to it he already knew it was going to happen so he already knows how to take you through it they could have never offended the king till joseph got in prison see the world can't go to falling apart until you start coming into a position it's a position of authority it's a position of the word of god being made alive in other words it's not laying on a page anymore it's come off into the heart of a man and a woman will you go also jesus ask them where you go also he said i wonder they thought huh the crowd's walking away what do i do will you go also what about you will you go also lord [Music] that's the words of eternal life where can i go to where can i go to you're in the hour when the rubbers met the road now there's no playing with games in church anymore he's coming down and says hey who do you say that i am well my sister my pastor my deacon my brother uh brother branham said you know said you were this he says but i want to know what you say about it see you ain't going to stand with somebody else you don't have to stand alone come here and when you see me brother when you stand alone when i stand alone and he stands alone then we can link up together and a threefold cord is not easily broken why because if it's just me and he you know other cord that's bound this together it's called the holy ghost uh-huh he is the binding in all of this the spirit of god is the binding that's binding us together hallelujah the blessing of betrayal the blessing of rejection when it comes to you don't fight those things let them come embrace them and say god i don't know why it's here but you had to permit it in my life so therefore i will rejoice because it's still a day that you have made you think i don't have to eat those words to you to think i don't have to eat the same bread but when i do it's bittersweet oh it's sweet in your mouth here but then it becomes bitter because it goes down and says hi you fit you you're starting to figure out you can't do this on your own you can't do this without me you can't figure this thing out without me you can't do it he says verse 3 says and he put them in the ward in the house of the captain of the guard in the prison and the place where joseph was bound and the captain of the guard charged joseph with them just my chance just happened chance come into the prison joseph how did joseph become in charge of the prison potipher's wife lied on him and i'm sure potiphar didn't give the man a good report he said this man tried to lay with my wife treat him harshly do everything you can to him except kill him barely keep him alive barely keep him fruity and then all of a sudden he walks in and he says hey i want you to take charge of this prison amen i can't figure that one out yeah i can because the one who orchestrated it is the one in the betrayal is there with joseph from start to finish and the captain of the guard charged joseph with them and he served them and they continue to season in the word and they dream to dream both of them each man in his each man's dream in one night each man according to the interpretation of his dream the butler and the baker the king of egypt were bound which were bound in prison yet not in verse 23 says yet not the chief butler remembered joseph but forget him another betrayal now when you get back to pharaoh would you tell him that i interpreted that dream correctly he said i'll do that for you when i get back another betrayal and we know that all things all things the ugly the nasty the horrible comes into your life and we know that all things what you are when nobody else sees you and we know that all things and we know that all things work all things work out hallelujah you said it ain't happened yet you know why because you give up you give up because you ain't seen it happen yet but i found out sister laurel when i pull eyesight and i pull time out of the picture i can say all things are possible i'm a believer he's called me according to his purpose and i step into the picture many of you heard that told said when my little girl was born that god said they give they they give me the diagnosis that she had down syndrome i never accepted it i had in a split second i had to accept that circumstance and i said i don't believe it you think that my mind didn't want to believe it because you know why the doctor the trained man said that she had this and he seen case after case after case you know what if i would accept it i would have betrayed the word of god and god said you will not betray my word because my word will not return unto me void [Applause] they said she'd have a hole in her heart or she had a hole in her heart we'd have to do surgery two years later it's closed up and they can't find it she'll have trouble with her eyes she don't have no trouble with her eyes she'll have trouble walking i have trouble keeping her down from climbing on stuff let alone walking running i wish you'll have trouble speaking she'll have trouble speaking oh you know what that's been a test of my faith but i had a voice it wasn't a man's voice it says i have healed her from that and so does she have it i said well he said she did not me it's those things that when any other betrayal comes into my life he's let that experience let me walk back into that and say now wait a minute i don't understand this right here but over here i knew you were god and your word has told me you ain't never changed and you will never ever change that you're the god of every impossibility that comes my way and i can go back over here and say you're a liar you're lying to me you're lying to me you know what in the last two weeks my little girl her speech has become so plain that i'm walking through the house and because it used to be jibber dabber now i'm like what did she say ask my wife it's every day what does she just say you know what it doesn't matter how long it lingers it doesn't matter how long the hurt is it doesn't matter how long the betrayal seems it doesn't matter how dark the night is going to get it is a blessing he said weeping may endure for a night he said but joy will come in the morning you just hang on because white will climb in the morning is the one who created the morning the one who created the trial the one who let the betrayal happen says i am still god i am still joel the shaman and wherever i step darkness has got to stand back glory to god hallelujah don't you think my thought hadn't betrayed me in six years but my heart his word ain't never betrayed me his word will take me all the way through and it doesn't matter who comes it doesn't matter who goes i've got to set my eyes on jesus christ and anything else does not matter there is nothing he cannot do this morning i said there is nothing you cannot do this morning but i want this to happen before this happens then you ain't gonna get it it's got to come how he says it will come joy will come in the morning many times you're in the morning and your mind is still in the night and god says hey it's time to wake up it's time to wake up it's time to shake yourself it's time to let go of the hurt emotions it's time to let go of what you're feeling let go and let god do what god can do best oh that goes against your human reasoning that goes against everything that you still want to feel you know why because you become comfortable and i become comfortable where we're at because we're creatures of comfort if you ain't figured it out there ain't nothing around you comfortable anymore brother branham said church life is running out he said home life is running out he says your work as a pastor will cease your work as a deacon will cease you know why because i hear the bills he is on his way he is coming back to get me i could hear the the tinkling on the on on the reins as the as the chariots coming around the corner as the bloodboards coming around the corner it ain't just any man that's coming in the wagon it ain't just any old padre that's coming but it's the king of kings and the lord of glories oh hallelujah he says but i've got to strip it all down i've got to pull it out away from you and we know that all things work together for the good of them that love god that are called according to his purpose no wonder paul said in a prison being betrayed by everybody around him because he stood for what he stood for the gospel that was revealed to him he said man did not reveal this gospel to me but it was the person of jesus christ that revealed it to him that ain't no man can give it to you and they ain't no man can take it away from you and they're down in that prison in the midst of being betrayed by everybody around him [Music] some of the greatest writings that you and i read that encourages your heart was in his darkest hour it was his darkest time that the greatest revelation come nobody was around him to pat him on the back nobody was around him to pump him up nobody was around him to encourage him i can see him sitting down there and i can see him struggling his mind you say de paul struggle he sure did in romans chapter seven he said oh who shall deliver me from this richest man that i am amen and i can just see all of a sudden in the midst of the darkness there's this little bitty thing starts to form over in the corner but he's discouraged he can't see it he's fighting his own feelings [Music] well god i know i was doing right i know it's a great work i was doing for you but why did you find me here he said because i can use you better here see if you ain't willing to take the road less traveled if you're not willing to take the road less travel how can he use you god why why am i here lord would you help me hey paul yes lord help me father maybe expect him to say okay i'm gonna i'm gonna open the gates and i'm gonna restore you right back to where you were at all he said is he paul my grace my unmerited favor nothing that you did paul remember where you were at paul you were a great intellectual giant you had your message figured out but you needed to meet the one who wrote the message you needed to meet me paul but lord you don't understand where i'm at he says my grace my grace is sufficient to you right where you're at my grace paul is sufficient do you believe that it's all working out paul for your good lord i have to trust you i have to believe that you are he says okay pick up your pen you want me to write in this dim condition you want me to be joyous now lord he says paul pick up your pen and write he said paul get up out of your pity party cause you ain't the only one i ain't having a pity well i know a prophet in the bible who said i'm the only one that's left elijah what is wrong with you i've got 7 000. you got what why i can't see them that ain't turned away just yet you see the gospel is not something afar off the gospel is flesh and the gospel tells you how to deal with things when it comes your way but you don't know what happened he does and you know what he expects out of you god bless you brother i love you anyway i appreciate you but he don't know what he did to me it don't matter what he did to me because i know what jesus christ did for me oh we're god in flesh we're christ in flesh then let's act like it what would you do if you had the revelation that he did all men will flee from me why didn't you go tell so and so that will you not leave me will you not forsake me he said lord been unto me according to the you know why he had to go through that because he knew exactly what every one of us would go through today he knew every emotion he knew every feeling that you would have right here right now and he says i want to be able to secure them i want to be able to help them in the time of need paul pick up your pen and write and tell them down there in 2020 and we know that all things watch this and it came to pass after oh you thought the trial come to stay you thought the heartache come to stay no it came to pass after it accomplished what he determined for it to do hello somebody it came to not stay but to pass after it accomplished according to whose purpose oh his purpose i i i've got to hurry and it came to pass at the end of two full years now notice god said four years in other words whatever joseph had to experience he couldn't bypass the experience oh my he couldn't bypass the experience however god said he was long he was going to experience he had to be right there to fully embrace it he had to be right there to fully fill every bit of it you notice god don't let you be absent from the pain he don't let you be absent from the trial he won't let you be absent from the heartache no he says show up be present oh my that pharaoh dreamed wait a minute pharaoh is going to have a dream and just so happen here's just by chance god's got this man that can interpret dreams in the prison in pharaoh's prison on top of that and behold he stood by the river then pharaoh verse 14. i'm not going to read it i'm not going to read much more then pharaoh sent and called jesus and they brought him out hastily of the dungeon and shaved himself and he shaved himself and he changed his raiment and came in under pharaoh now what if he'd have said well i've been here this long i think i'll just stay i am at least in charge of the prison and things are going my way right now no pharaoh said hey when the king summons you got to move i don't feel like moving you're going to move or he's going to make you move and he shaved himself and he changed his raiment you say i'm heavy this morning well then put on the garment of gladness praise him anyway it don't matter how i feel no matter how you feel i told the church i said we come in here we come sad why what are you sad for it didn't go the way you thought it would go big deal there's a lot of things in my life that way they didn't but i found out that god knows how to make it work out for my good and somewhere along the line i'm going to embrace the glory i'm going to step into the glory let's make sure that we we we must make sure that we ain't comfortable lay out the sins hey i don't know how to be anybody else but me i don't know how to do anything but get out of his way so he can speak none of what i'm saying this morning was premeditated i'll let you look at my notes i just got a few scriptures that's it but he knows right where you're at and he changed his ramen came in unto pharaoh and now therefore let pharaoh look out a man discrete and wise verse 33 and set him over the land of egypt after he told pharaoh everything here's his recommendation to egypt he's going to let a prisoner he's gonna let a man who experienced betrayal in a way that and probably nobody had ever experienced betrayal and now he's gonna let him tell the king give the king advice hello potiphar hello master's wife that was all part of god's plan by the way he had the testing and trying to make sure that he was fit to rule i heard a man say one time the power without character is what oh but power with counter character is what but you know how you're gonna get the character [Music] you got to experience it you got to be stripped down you got to be laid in the mud you got to be have no more feelings and and you can't even move every day and you can't this and you can't that you get to i can't god i can't i can't i can't he says i know but i can now therefore let a man let pharaoh seek out look out a man of a man discreet and wise and set him over the land of egypt let pharaoh do this let him appoint officers over the land and take up a fifth part of the land of egypt in seven plenties years and let them gather all the food of those good years that come and lay up corn under the hand of pharaoh and let them keep food in the cities and that food shall be restored to the land against the seven years of famine which shall be in the land of egypt that the land not perished through the famine and the thing was good in the eyes of pharaoh in the eyes of all his servants and pharaoh said unto his servants can we find such a man as this a man in whom the spirit of god is the man who experienced the great betrayal who had the spirit of god hallelujah and pharaoh said unto joseph for as much as god has showed thee all this there is none so discreet and wise of thou art thou you pharaoh joseph you've done learned what you need to learn you done experienced the pain and the suffering now i want you to be second in command of egypt thou shalt be over my house and according unto my word shall all my people be ruled power without character according to thy word shall all my people be ruled only in the throne will i be greater than thou and pharaoh said unto joseph see i have set thee over all the land of egypt and pharaoh took off his ring from his hand where do you think the betrayal went at that moment i would imagine if he knew romans 8 28 he was said lord not we and i know that all things you say it's not happened yet brother tim well it might be tomorrow it might be five years from now i don't know but all i know is it did not come to stay it come to pass and pharaoh took the ring off from his hand and put it up on joseph's hand and arrayed with him vestures of fine linen isn't that amazing that when i go back over here he was his own familiar house he was stripped of everything he was stripped of something that he loved god said you're wearing the wrong coat joseph i've got something made of fine silk i want you to wear in the future but i've got to mold your character to be able to put them on investors a fine linen and put a gold chain about around his neck do you realize that all that he lost was restored to him it didn't come back the way he thought it should see you can't go back to that point and change anything that's happened whatever's happening in your life you can't go back and change it there's nothing you can do but many times you're up here trying to go forward and you're living back here and god says hey i'm up here where are you at well lord come here come here come here pick up your tambourine and dance i don't feel like it pick it up anyway and dance you know sometimes i don't feel like going to church i told the church i said y'all think you're the only ones that don't want to come to church i said sometimes i just don't want to come to church i don't want to get out of bed on sunday mornings sometimes i'm just tired i said but something gets me up [Music] something rolls me over on my elbow i can't get my eyes open it drops my feet on the floor and i ain't got but three hours of sleep because i'm worried about somebody in the church and i can't sleep all night long i'm worried about a situation or problem and i'm praying for that problem i don't want to get up and come here this morning god says hey it ain't about you i didn't call you for you i didn't gift you for you i gifted you for my glory [Applause] i i told some at the church just recently i said look whether you're a deacon a trustee a musician a minister or a pastor or whatever it is i said if you haven't figured out this thing ain't about you then you can't even serve god the way you want to because you'll do everything in the church you can to serve yourself to make you look good but real ministry is when you say there's no reward what did joseph expect to gain in the prison taking care of prisoners nothing but something was in him that drove him on to do it because there was a reward at the end of the road that he could not see i like what brother josh bennett i heard him at brother little nathan barrett's a funeral there he was talking about death he said death is only as far as you can see but there's more beyond that well where i'm at is the hardest trial brother tim it didn't come to stay it came to pass wonder how many times the bible says that go look go use your search engine look and it came to pass and it came to pass and it came to pass and he made him to ride the second chariot which he had and that cried before him bow the knee and he made him ruler over the land of egypt and pharaoh said unto joseph i am pharaoh without thee no man shall lift up his hand or foot in all of egypt and we know that you don't understand what happens and neither did joseph until their confront of his brothers and that dream he had as a boy he said oh now all my complaining was in vain all my fussing and stew and why this happened to me was in vain because i have god had a purpose in it all right hold on you'll find the purpose it is okay weeping may endure for a night the joy cometh in the morning i want you to think about this and i'm getting ready to let you go every person every christian has to learn to surrender to betrayal don't mean you like it don't mean you can rejoice in it in your flesh per se but it is a blessing to you that means everything that comes your way well i know everything that's coming orchestrated of god well i i agree with that but i find in the bible and the oldest book where he said satan where you been well i've been walking up into and throwing down there he said hey have you considered my bride have you considered her well i would but you done got her protected you got a hedge about her there can't nothing get into her ain't none like her in the earth satan have you noticed her well i've been watching her for 6 000 years but i can't get into her he says i'll make a deal with you i'll let you go down and bring betrayal right into her and she will not turn her back on me [Applause] that's a deal i'll take and he comes down and he lets your close relative you know this thing ain't right that's right i can prove to you [Music] says who says who you can prove you can prove what i want if you i don't care about the message i got a question i want you to prove to me how a woman can have a baby without knowing a man scientifically tell me how two men can walk on the water how can two men get out of a boat and walk on the water from a scientific standpoint how can a man take five loaves and two fishes and break them off and keep creating you can't prove it but something inside said that ain't nothing but the true [Applause] how can a little shrimp of a man go up to the city gates and take the gates off and put him on his back and walk up to a mountain kill a lion and kill a thousand philistines with a jawbone of a dried-up ass you can't prove it but my bible said it and i believe it [Applause] i ain't in this thing to play i ain't playing games i'm not drawing the sword either but the captain of the lord's host said this is my message this is my bride this is my wife and i will defend her don't you defend nothing don't you fight for nothing let god himself come down and fight where is the god of elijah let him answer by fire [Applause] hallelujah i don't figure this out i didn't start myself in this thing and i ain't gonna finish this thing and i've been throwing fat on my face too many times and i still should not be standing but something got me up when i shouldn't stand he got me up [Applause] hallelujah a lot of stuff in here i can't explain a lot of stuff i can't make proof to you that's there how do i know genesis is an accurate description there are no record there are no history that proves it but i'm taking the word i'm taking the word of a man who've had the pillar of fire visiting and he told me that how god brought creation into existence i can't prove it but i sure can't believe it you don't have to figure it out you don't have to justify it you don't have to defend it but he said if thou canst believe all things are possible brother kelly [Applause] were you there where are you there were you there when they took that ball bald-headed prophet and they put him down in the lion's den for praying were you there when the pillar of fire come around and told and said all right kenny you go lay down you go lay down and let that prophet lay his head on you and use you for appealing you was not there but you believe it hello don't talk to me about what we call the message answer my questions about this and then we'll go somewhere oh it's my faith then i take the same faith and i apply to what's been delivered to my day [Applause] it's one lord one faith one baptism one word of god and it's the truth [Music] prove it to me prove this to me you can't do it you cannot prove it you can't prove it show me in history where every man is ever one time witness chariots of fire a chair of fire coming down and picking up a man and taking him up but the bible said elisha seen it well i can't prove it but something says oh you know why because i met the same god at elijah man i don't have trouble with it i don't have trouble with this bible brother carlos i can't prove it i can't but i sure can preach it by inspiration and say hey this is what it means you know why because i'm not giving tim hayden's context anymore it's the one who wrote it for the time in the season that you're in in your life comes down and takes the word there is nothing new under the sun there is no temptation but what's common to all men and he takes the scripture of the old testament says i know where you're at but let me show you how it ends i've been figured out if i'm going to be defended sister larrell i can't defend myself and if i'm worth it he'll take care of it he'll take care of all the battles for me if i'll let him fight him but i'll run into him and i want to to do it i want to prove this and i want to prove i can't i can't i can't even prove to you that god lives in my heart can you prove it to me i know one thing my desires have changed something happened how do i know it's an apple tree because it don't produce pears it don't produce oranges when i reach off the tree and i take an apple see it's too simple laying it when i reach off the tree and i take an apple and i bite into it it ain't tangy and it ain't sharp like an orange or like a grapefruit no it's sweet and it's juicy why because it's an apple tree watch how jesus how simply makes it by their fruits [Music] i told the church the other night i said it used to be god's center prophet was enough and we found out that wouldn't hold you he used to be while i received the word for my day so i know that's the baptism the holy ghost but you found out there is no intellectual birth it is a snotting crying repenting acts 2 38 baby what god started at pentecost is what he's continuing on today [Applause] [Music] oh we're past pentecost i'm past the isms but i ain't past the original i passed the original experience refilling me every once in a while that's what keeps me going it ain't what i know up here because you know what i figured out i don't know i know very little don't worry about trying to prove this thing don't worry about trying to prove how can you prove a belief i know my wife loves me yet i can't prove it well she does this for me well she might do that but she might be mad at me and do me call do it to me because the word says to do it that ain't love well i'm gonna do it because the bible said i've got to do it the word says i got to do it no i just know that i know that i know that she loves me i can't put a finger on it i can't touch it i can't see it per se but i just know amen the blessing of betrayal is an awesome thing he's still the same god he has not changed any part of himself can you say amen can you say amen that he has not changed situations change many problems come but god himself has not changed i believe he's saying to you i'm god don't be grieved don't be angry because of what you're you've experienced didn't catch me by surprise who is like unto me oh who can you compare me to he says who is before me who is after me i am the all-existing god i had to permit that whatever comes into your life he says i had to permit it because i want you like isaiah i want you to come and say god no matter what comes my way no matter lord what i experience here am i send me he says you know i still have the bomb of gilead you bet you got to come away my love you got to come over here to me just a little bit and let me just love on you for just a little bit let me let me share with you the secrets of my heart i had to let it happen [Music] i like what the psalmist david says as the musicians comes psalms 3041 says i will bless the lord at oh there's that word all again [Music] i will bless the lord at all times if not for grace his praise shall sometimes continually be in my mouth praise ye the lord praise god in a sanctuary praise him in the firmament of his power praise him for his mighty axe praise him according to his excellent greatness [Music] praise him with the sound of the trumpet praise him with a sultry praise him in the heart praise him with the timbrel in the dance praise him with his stringed instruments and organs praising him upon the loud symbols praising him upon the high sounding symbols praise him in the hard times praise him in the thing that you didn't think was blessed let everything that had breath praise the lord praise you the lord giveth and the lord taketh away blessed be the name of the lord realize that god don't take nothing from you but he don't return it a whole lot better [Music] simon do you mind if i borrow your boat what are you going to do with it lord i'm going to preach where do you want it lord push it right out there and he stands out [Music] he says john [Music] i guess we'll just throw [Music] no we haven't caught nothing and we're getting ready to go home he says oh drop your net over on that side of the boat lord i have already praised you and ain't nothing happened i've already let my neck down lord he says hey how about you let it down one more time [Music] nevertheless thy word lord see they loaned him the boat he took it from him just a little bit he gave it back there was a blessing that was already in the boat they were aggravated they were frustrated they were grieving it was the greatest catch of their life god don't take nothing and it's more refined it's a greater victory it's a greater appreciation of him it's hard on you and hard on him [Music] but he never said the road would be easy he never said that it's going to be a flowery bed of eve and you always have somebody walking with you [Music] he never told peter who said come take me that wall [Music] god [Music] through the eyes [Music] hallelujah [Music] oh [Music] i once was [Music] me [Music] [Music] hallelujah [Music] i want to sing this song [Music] but in his presence is where all the hearts go away the troubles vanish this is my favorite song i play this guitar at home all the time by myself because i've understood [Music] for my [Music] [Applause] [Music] ah [Music] one more time oh [Music] now [Music] hallelujah [Music] [Applause] [Music] amen [Music] yes [Music] [Applause] yes [Music] [Music] as they continue to play softly speak to him this morning we only have one service after this we will go home i just talked to him we've been going through a lot [Music] the brother doesn't even know what we went through in this church i never even talked to him about it but he came and i don't think it's him i believe it's the holy spirit and he came and speak directly what happened here [Music] you remember on wednesday when we spoke we say that ruth have to learn to depend on god you remember that the split happened the separation happened because god wants you to serve it in a different category god wants you to lean on his shoulder because the land of judah depends on god who's watching over that land 360 years that is the new capacity god wants you to serve him he wants you to surrender everything forgetting everything that is in the past forget what people talk about forget about what people say in your name forget about what report was
