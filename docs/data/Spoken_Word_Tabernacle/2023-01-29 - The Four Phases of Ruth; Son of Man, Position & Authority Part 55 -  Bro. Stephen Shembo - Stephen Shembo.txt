scripture this morning glory to God you should be more free than me because I am the one on a hot seat everybody okay glory to God Genesis chapter 18. this is a lot of be heavy okay so give me some Grace because as a pastor I took a little bit of time you took my time so that I have to explain you and go through all of this okay so just be relaxed because I need to move a different way so we can drop this and clear the issue between the comings of the Lord everybody okay everybody okay so don't sleep Genesis chapter 18 verse 1. if you dare you can say amen amen and the Lord did what appeared so it's water it is a water and appearance amen don't be afraid if you make a mistake that's okay at least the answer we in a family okay all right and the Lord appeared to him in the plains of memory brother send me back my uh feedback here so I can control it yeah the congregation is good it's just me I need to hear myself so he will settle me here and he sat in the tent Door In the Heat of the day everybody okay and he lift up his eyes and look and low how many men three men stood by him and when he saw them he Abraham run to meet them from the 10th door and buy himself toward the ground you might be seated and when Abraham saw these three men from the appearing the appearing produce three men everybody okay they were visible everybody okay and when Abraham saw the appearing he saw three of them verse three and Abraham say Ma not my lords even though they were three Abraham say my Lord singular do you know what Lords means do you know what your lord means it means Elohim everybody okay so Abraham look he say oh Elohim amen his picture we don't know how does how did those three men looks we don't know but brother Branham said they were created and God stepped into one of them everybody okay so the face he used we don't know my question do you see the man Jesus here there's no Jesus here Jesus is the man it's not here everybody okay and he said my Lord singular three Abraham still see one he said my Lord singular even though they three amen and we know that among those three only one was the Lord everybody okay so somehow the eyes of Abraham was focused on one of them are we okay verse 3 and he said my Lord if now I have found favor in your sight pass not away I pray you from your servant job to verse 9. Hallelujah and they say to him how many people say they plural are we okay that's why I told you please stay up okay and they plural spoke to him said to him where is Sarah your wife and he said behold in the water change so they knew that Abraham was married even though they look they appeared to be stranger verse 10 and he's saying I want you to notice in verse 9 the Bible say they say everybody okay but he moved from they to he amen and remember Abraham say Lord one so we need to know who's he is he one of the three because one is God the other one are not God everybody okay from day to one verse 10 and he said I so singular one person now he's talking when they ask him all of them turn around they say where is Sarah your wife and then one of them say I me we okay I will certainly do what return everybody okay so there is two things here this man that is talking came everybody okay and he came in appearance [Applause] everybody okay so disappearance is connected to the coming down of Elohim everybody okay to talk to Abraham but Elohim is telling Abraham that I will again return amen are we okay so there is a coming thank you and there is also a return are we okay he says I will certainly it's a precision I want you to be sure of that I will certainly return to you according to the time of water life you know the circle already and Lord Sarah your wife shall have a son now when he return there is no place in the scripture that showed when God returned back everybody okay they are appearing everyone even Abraham's servant could look and say we see God again amen everybody okay everybody okay but when he returns it is completely a secret nobody knows what happens but how do we know that he returned there is only one son that show the people that Elohim returned And that son was one morning when Abraham woke up everybody okay and he opened the door when he came out and yes and look he said Master you look like you were 20 years older [Applause] whatever I say at the beginning when I'm new to the the the YouTube please take it put it aside okay okay when you leave church then begin to form Ponder on everything you want to point okay now let's focus to the words everybody okay everybody okay okay so when Elohim returned the only son you can tell is in the morning when Sarah come out and he has to say but these days were passed [Applause] I remember when we were young and I begin to work for you in other words the returning of God brought a change of body everybody okay and it was a secret return [Applause] everybody okay and if you notice before Elohim returned Sarah was barren everybody okay everybody okay but when Elohim came back in secret nobody's seen it amen Sarah changed and the bareness of Sarah was taken off because she conceived later on in other words they return will not only change the body but it will also correct everything that is in the body that is wrong [Music] every imperfection in the body will be completely corrected if in your body you miss a finger when Elohim return you're gonna have your finger [Applause] if you went to a surgery and your doctor remove a gallbladder when Elohim returned you will have a brand new gallbladder oh God verse 10 and he said I will certainly return to you according to the time of life and lost Sarah your wife shall have a son and Sarah heard it in the tent door which was how behind him so that man he's back was turned towards Sarah in his appearing the back of this man will be turned toward the woman everybody okay remember this man that is turning his back towards Sarah is not Jesus of Nazareth everybody okay everybody okay jump to verse 11. now Abraham and Sarah were old everybody okay and stricken and well-stricken in age and he ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of water so you know what he means job to verse 14. everybody okay foreign too hard for the Lord so that man was the Lord but he was not Jesus the man I'm trying to emphasize stuff here remember Jesus he's twoform he can be Jesus the word or Jesus the flesh that's why I told you to keep up with sermon okay and the Lord said to Abraham verse 14 is anything too hard for the Lord at the appointed at the time appointed so this returning have a specific day and if you notice Elohim never gave that date it is a date that Elohim himself knows nobody else knows that date it's a precise day that Elohim will come back [Music] it's an appointed time it's an appointed time it is specific I'm trying to save you 50 years of headache anybody okay at the time appointed I will return to you everybody okay according to the time of what and Sarah shall have a son everybody okay job 2 verse 20. and the Lord say because the Cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great and because their sin is very water Grievous so these things were happen when the condition of the time has the condition of Sodom and Gomorrah [Applause] in other words we will have homosexual everybody okay everybody okay it will be a time of provision and during that time Elohim was sleep up but when he was sleep up he's not gonna change the body of Sarah and Abraham yet he's coming down to give them a son everybody okay and the Sun is called in the message of the hour the Messiah son [Applause] which is the son of discernment it is when God doesn't have not met you physically and the first day he meets you he can tell you all about your life it is called a messiah son how do you know it's a messiah son his back have to be turned back turn toward the woman everybody okay so if you see a man one day that his body is not the body of Jesus of Nazareth [Music] everybody okay and that man has the ability to discern the heart of the people until he can turn his back [Music] to the congregation or to the church just know you are in the time of the son of man [Music] everybody okay let's go to Roman to John chapter 12. glory to God Hallelujah if you dare you can say Amen glory to God if you dare you can say Amen Hallelujah verse 27. remember he will have to redeem my time okay we already agree everybody okay John chapter 12 verse 27 if you dare you can say amen amen now that was our first scripture this is what we pull for my scripture we can pull more than this amen but let's stop right there so far verse 27 now this is Jesus speaking is my soul trouble and what shall I say father save me from this hour but for this course came I to this hour so something begin to trouble the Lord Jesus amen and Jesus now prays he says father glorify your name what is the name of the father Jesus said I came in my father's so what is the name of the father [Music] but Jesus is saying glorify your name what does he mean the prayer of Jesus is Father glorified your name your name is power and that name is Jesus we already know which is the name of the father father verse 28 glorify your name everybody okay when Jesus asked for glorification I'm going slow so you can soak it when Jesus requests glorification from God it triggers something from God amen when Jesus used the word glorify something came up what came out the Bible says then came there a water a voice from him are you awake please there came a voice from where Heaven so glorification trigger a voice number one it trigger a voice amen come on saying I have both water glorified it and I will water glorify it again so there is two clarification everybody okay the voice is saying I have glorified you and I will do it again how many glorification so glorification have two part they will glorify you the first time and they will glorify you there and we already seen that translation and glorification happened the first glorification happened where and the second glorification happened where and Jesus on the river of Jordan all right everybody okay when they were baptizing him by John the Baptist when Jesus was coming out the spirit of the Lord came and brother Branham said he received his baptism of the Holy Ghost right there I have glorified you but I will glorify you again everybody okay the Bible says this in the book of act verse 3 chapter brother when you see me coming back you know what to do in the book of Acts chapter 3 verse 13 the god of Abraham and of Isaac and of Jacob the god of our fathers has water glorified his son who Jesus Jesus this was after the day of Pentecost so Jesus already Rose and Jesus went to heaven so Jesus was already glorified everybody okay so they glorify him the first time and they are glorifying him there second time that's why Jesus could cross the Wall everybody okay that's why Jesus could eat a sandwich and disappear everybody okay because the promise to us I'm gonna glorify you and I'm gonna glorify you again but this glorification started with a voice verse 29 the people therefore stood that stood by and heard it says he did water thundered come on now come on now brother Jesus everybody okay so what we call the voice is a thunder this voice can also be called a thunder everybody okay so glorification when you bring glorification it will open me Thunder come back verse 29 the people therefore that stood by and heard it say that he did water Thunder others says a water so this voice is a thunder and this verse also is dementia everybody okay so when you see a Ninja it is already a panda [Music] thank you everybody okay and when you see a Manger a mansion is already a voice because a Manger is a messenger and the messenger and his message or his voice that's why you hear in the message seven verses seven angels seven I love this church so when we say seven voices seven pandas seven Angel we are talking about that [Music] this message is perfectly in line with the Bible so from today if you hear somebody say the seven voices don't be you say Amen if they say the seven pandas you say Amen if you say the seven seal you say Amen if you say there are seven angels you say what it depends on what you want to eat if you want vanilla if you want confetti if you want a strawberry it's up to you everybody okay everybody okay glory to God let's go to Romans chapter 8. yeah the word made flesh is when we take the scripture and we make it action to the time you are living in so you can catch it okay in other words about that's why the Bible cannot be changed because the Bible despite the generation it will always fit your generation but it's an old book we don't have upgrade that oh because we are in 2023 we need the new Bible no no no no the same Bible can upgrade itself it's upgrade by the interpretation of the prophet of Yahweh yes sir so the upgrade of the Bible is the word made flesh for your day [Applause] [Music] I found one Paul no problem I have found two arrangeas iPhone 7. with a Marion planner [Applause] let's go to Roman 8. when I say that the new generation they just catch it like this and they say Amen because this language is not for Moses if I preach to Moses he won't hear me he will be like what is iPhone I said because it's not your message it is our message your message was in your own time to take Israel out of that he need to come back with Elijah then he will learn iPhone when I'm already in the rapture [Applause] let's go to Roman 8 to verse 18. praise God because the Holy Spirit now is moving Hallelujah Romans chapter 8 verse 18. if you dare you can say amen amen Lord Jesus help me 18. for I reckon that the suffering of this present s are not worthy to be compared with the you remember True Glory their Glory which shall be how where so there is a glory of the future [Music] glorification two of them Paul is saying we already are Christian we already glorify in our flesh but no matter what trial are you going through now no matter how hard it is at your work at your job with children sickness or whatever or what the devil has projected to your family your suffering cannot be compared to the glory that will be revealed in you to this thing right here everybody okay now let's pray Heavenly Father Lord we are approaching you humbly father this morning thanking you once again father for your grace for the love your mercy Lord and for everything you have been doing for us Lord we are committing ourselves once again unto that hand father may you move me completely out of the place I seen what you just did right now and I thank you for doing it now I know father for sure that you're the one moving this plane right now father I pray that every demonic Spirit every unclean Spirit every unclean thought can be completely taken off from this place father may you come and speak to this congregation and bless them and those that are online and those that will will be streaming later on may this be a blessing to the soul and bring them closer unto thee we thank you and committed unto their hand in the name of Jesus Christ amen my subject this morning glory to God the devil you don't even want me to say it wasting your time let's go this way glory to God Amen have you ever seen something like this he want me to talk about him brothers please if you can help me move on there but I'm gonna tell you what it is all right my subject this morning if you would open Hebrew one so that will prepare you completely as the moving day Hebrew chapter one glory to God okay and then you can click back again to open it and see if he will please move on that's it let's see okay praise the Lord thank you brother Robert let's go one that already worked my subject this morning is the four phases of roof the son of man revealed or coming I put it under okay the son of man how are coming everybody okay we are in the trashing floor with roof where roof has been given six measures of barley and when she was given six measure of Bali roof is now United in word you already understand with Boaz but they cannot touch one another in the body in other words they cannot unite themselves in the body until the King's Men Redeemer that is still in between and still have claim on roof is completely taken away everybody okay in other words you can never meet Jesus Christ in the corporal if that Kingsman Redeemer have still claim in your life everybody okay and when the King's Men Redeemer was removed then Boaz was United in the body with roof and then they produce a baby which was called Obed everybody okay when you will take the threshing flow and we converted into the Tabernacle everybody okay in the Tabernacle the threshing floor is in the holiest where roof already received her first encounter with Boaz in secret everybody okay and Boaz unfolded the sixth measure of Bali and told the roof to go home and do water and rest everybody okay but there is a second coming every turn of Boaz now when Boaz is returning he's returning to pick up roof and go with roof home everybody okay everybody okay in the first encounter even though roof could sleep at the feet of Boaz roof could not stay ready boa said you need to go quickly and make sure nobody knows that you came here everybody okay but when the Boaz is coming the second time Boaz doesn't hide it everybody okay he's coming boldly to take roof wrong and then we found out that now roof is into the holiest where she's resting and she's resting as a preparation for her disappearing everybody okay and the disappearing is the rewarding of roof which is the rapture which bring the body change which bring the transformation which bring the translation everybody okay which we call the Rapture itself so body change transformation translation and uh and uh and all and glorification all these things are only one thing by different terminology everybody okay now last Sunday this is where we stop we found out that Colossians won't say that Jesus Christ who is the image because the image of God is Christ you remember that who is the image of the invisible God he's the firstborn of water every creature he was the firstborn of every creature because he was the first one that was created you already understand that God was first the spirit everybody okay God moved from a spirit and God become the word all the logos all the theophany or the one we call Melchizedek we already know that now and he moved from Melchizedek and God dropped down into flesh this is very important because it's going to clear all the smoke today Lord's willing everybody okay so we're moving from a spirit form into a tea or funny from a theophany into the flesh or the body or the corporal everybody okay and we found out that first God moved from the spirit into the word and when he was the word this is when God begin to create everything everybody okay he wants the first creature God created God himself and then God that was created begin to create everything everybody okay and we found out that collusion Paul says that for by him the word we're all fixed water created that our way and that are in the water visible or invisible whether there be water or water or water or water and we found out that all of these are categories of angels amen so God begin to create the Angels first everybody okay everybody okay let's go to Hebrew chapter one verse 4. father help me if you dare you can say Amen when God created himself as the logos the Bible explained to us that he was made so much better than water we saw that stay up my friend please he was made so much better than water then Angel give him some volume usually this is the one that works better per my observation thank you amen and the Bible says that being made so much better than Angel as he has by inheritance obtained a more excellent Name than they so there are a couple of things here number one he was better than angel which we already seen better than Angel because he's the one that created angel he created the throne the Dominion the principality the Mighty the power all that Army he created that and number two Hebrew is saying here that he has a name that is above everything okay what are we talking here when we're talking about the name now Paul says here he says all things were created by Him and for him and he is before water because he was the first one that appeared and there was nothing he was before anything then he began to create everybody okay and by him all fixed the water consists Paul says in Ephesians which he wrote In Christ when he raised him from the dead and set him at his own right hand in the Heavenly places far above our water principality and water house and water if you notice Mighty was not mentioned here everybody okay here we had prawns Dominion principalities power but there is another category that is called the might you must say might and power are the same thing if you look here it says power and might it's too separated we okay now he says fire above water and water power give him some volume please and water and water and every name you see that he's not just better than Angel but the second thing is his name everybody okay every name daddy's name not only in water this world but also that which is how to come what are you talking about the name remember Jesus said glorify that foreign here in Philippians 2 verse 10 he says that at the name of water Jesus we okay now what happened at the name of Jesus when you say Jesus because Paul says that number one is better than all the angel why because he created everything and he created the angel you cannot be better than your creator everybody okay but number two Paul says that he was given a name that is excellent why is this name excellent Paul explained that when you say Jesus what does he mean to a believer everybody okay Paul says and that name and the name of Jesus what happened should water Every Praise Every Praise every kind of worship we can do it is to our God everybody okay so at the name of Jesus how many knees do you see an exception there every knee should do water now did they tell you which knee did they say every human need did they say every engine do angels look like human being do they have me so everybody the heavenly do animal have knees everybody okay so every means in other words every creature you got it now whether it is an animal whether Ace is a ninja whether it is a human everything why because he's the one that created all of him everybody okay at the name of Jesus every knee should do what now or fixed in water heaven and fixing water and fixed way under the Earth so the power of the name of Jesus Christ is dominating through here yes sir all right come on man everybody okay he dominates the heaven everybody okay he dominates the Earth and he also dominate under the Earth and we know that in heaven they are Dimension we already went through that when you going up in heaven you're gonna get to the region of the save then you pass the angel then God himself when you're going down you go to the region of the Lost then the demon then Lucifer himself so the name of Jesus Christ when you say it in heaven everything down everybody okay on the earth everybody down if you get to hear everybody down everybody okay so the domain of the power of Jesus Christ is unlimited [Applause] everybody okay the Bible said and that every word should have confess that Jesus is water lord means Elohim in other words everybody will one day recognize that Jesus Christ is God let me continue he said that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is who to water the the glory of God there father if you notice in Revelation chapter 5 when they were calling from The Kingsmen Redeemer everybody okay they said who is worthy everybody okay and I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice who is water worthy to open death and to lose the water and no man in water heaven and nor in water neither because there is nobody that is above Jesus Christ [Applause] everybody okay his name dominate the heaven it dominates the Earth he dominates the underworld everybody okay and to even pick up the book amen in heaven there was no one on the earth no one under the Earth no one in other words the right to the book of redemption belong to the person that is higher than heaven higher than the earth and higher than the other [Applause] do you follow me notice what Paul is saying here Paul says here and no man this is John first no man in heaven and nor in the earth neither under the Earth was able to open the book needed to do what look there on now watch Paul he said for discos I buy money unto the father of water our Lord Jesus Christ are you catching what I'm saying the family me of Heaven and Earth has a name [Applause] everybody okay but that name is already higher than everything in heaven higher than anything on Earth higher than anything under the heaven and it's not only the name of one person [Applause] [Music] everybody okay it is the name of the entire family everybody okay so Jesus is not the only one authorized to use the name Jesus I don't know let me go slowly because you're taking time brother Charles Hamilton please say it loud which church do you go to [Applause] brother Lamont which church do you go to brother Joshua which church do you go to brother our sister Divine which church do you go to do you see any changes in this huh all of them have the right [Applause] [Music] whether a woman whether a man whether a baby even a baby the baby back there if you ask her she can say oh I would say it means word everybody okay so I am not the only one to use the words word everybody that is a member of this church have the right to represent themselves as spoken word Tabernacle [Applause] everybody okay everybody okay Paul says this that of whom the whole water family in water heavy and water did you see him saying under the Earth [Applause] scripture don't play with water our family is not in hell foreign [Applause] [Music] this family of Jesus Christ you only found them in two places either they are on earth or they are well in heaven you will never find his family down there because one of this day the Lamb of God died on Calvary and he went down to Hell and he opened the door and he pulled his family out hey everybody okay he said David come out job come out Abraham come out Ezekiel come up Adam comma everybody came out [Music] and because of his blood he cause of this Blood the entrance to hell was locked everybody okay so when you die as a Christian don't worry that's why Christian died peacefully they're not worrying where they're going because as they're sliding automatically they are angels that are coming up and say come on buddy everybody okay everybody okay that's why Paul said the family in heaven and the family where not the family and because there is no representation of you in hell when you go to hell if they check they say you don't belong here we will never open the door for you even if you want to go to hell hell will kick you off because you don't belong to hell you belong to a royal family a family of Jesus Christ a family that is above everything above everything in Heaven above everything on the Earth above everything under and at your name add your name every need will bow before you [Music] everybody okay there is no creature that is on top of you [Applause] foreign Lord help me look at this my brother look at this my brother Paul is saying this I want you to catch this Paul is saying this he said he has done what he has put water oh under his feet and he gave him to be the water hey of the water all things he did it to whom to a church if you look at a different translation it says this he says that God put everything under the feet of Jesus and gave him to be the head of everything for the benefit of the church go search your translation amen so whatever God was doing in Jesus Christ he was doing it for you when Jesus was catching demon and locking them up what he was looking at he said I'm doing this so brother Kalima one day will know what I'm doing and he locked the devil and put him down he said which demon again demon of who last bring him here he said you lost come over here let's say master I'm sorry I'm sorry he said don't worry I'm doing this so my children will be free from you everybody okay so everything was put under his feet not because of him because he's God it is for your benefit let me help you out Lord help me look at Paul he says and to make all men to see what is the water Fellowship of this mystery which from the water beginning of the world has been how who created how all things by who Jesus Christ are you ready are you ready he created our thing by Jesus Christ why to the water so when God taught Jesus to start creating everything he was doing that for a purpose what was the intent of God by giving the creation power to Jesus he says he do the intent that now you know who they are and on to the water in how heavily he didn't say heavenly places in Christ watch there did you notice that they didn't say in Heavenly places in Christ because Heavenly places is Christ is the position of the believer if a demon entered there he's converted he's no longer a demon he cannot get there to get there you must be justified sanctify baptized with the Holy Ghost then you enter the Heavenly places in Christ [Applause] [Music] everybody okay but these principalities are in Heavenly places your Corona is in Heavenly places everybody okay he says now to the intent that unto the water and water how anywhere Heavenly places might be known by who the church the water water wisdom of God so God is using the church everybody okay I said two to make the principalities and the power nor his power in other words when you're in trouble the one who's supposed to cast The Devil is Jesus himself do you follow me but Jesus say I cannot do that myself I have a family I'm gonna magnify my name when I magnify my name my name is above everything then I take that power and I give it to the church so me Jesus can sleep do you follow me so if the demon wanna know my power they don't need to come to me they just need to come to brother said because I want to make known the money fall of my power and my wisdom by the church that's why in my name you not me you you must cast that water when you're doing that Jesus in heaven said praise the Lord that's what I was working for keep up children good job go ahead and whoop them whoop them whoop them if you're not casting out therefore he's not happy he made it so you can exercise your power you can exercise your parity Moses one day was crying he do something further he do something

John chapter 3 verse 3 the Bible said Jesus answer and say unto him verily verily I say unto thee except amount be a man be water born again he cannot see the Water Kingdom of God Jesus didn't say

were on verse uh on verse four let's go to verse 5. Lord help me four to which of the Angels say he at any time you are my son so God birth something he's calling him the Son of God everybody okay which is the word this day have our water because so God begotten he birthed something and we already seen that what he birth is the tea of honey the word everybody okay have I begotten you and again I will be to him watch verses six and do you see the word again do you see the word again so number one buff and there is a birthday game so Jesus when he see us he said you must be born again everybody okay God the way he became human follow me he went from the first birth amen but the first birth of God he was never a flesh follow me carefully the first birth of God God birth himself as the word everybody okay then God asked the word because when he birth himself he disappeared here as the word he birthed himself again and when he birth himself on again this is a this is B then God become what verse 6 and again when he brings in the first water you see his first begotten because he's the first one into the water so in other words he begin to take the logos and make him enter the world the second time so the first birth it's the word the second birth is the but me and you we didn't come that way we came from the spirit all the way to the water so there is one step we skip [Applause] you following me so when Jesus is coming he checks us he said you're missing a piece [Music] are you following me you are missing a piece you are supposed to be too when I touch you you only flesh where is your word [Applause] [Music] [Applause] The Mystery of the new birth [Applause] you need to know why you need to be born again in other words God is telling you you miss a step that's why you have trouble the way I was born I was first word then I was flesh but when I take you flesh where is your partner which part god Your Divine party [Applause] [Music] this is why the devil trouble you where is your Divine part I don't know what you're talking about Let Me Explain you what I'm talking about this is what I'm talking about Hallelujah he says and Nicodemus say unto him how can a man be water born when he is what oh so Nicodemus look he say hey hey me 50 something you're telling me to be born again so I need to shank myself and go to my mama again my mom is already dead Jesus look he say you with your PhD everybody okay he came hey how can a man be born when he's what can he enter the water in water so the first time you were in your mother's womb let me explain you that this so you understand because you're trying to uh fight I mean your brain is fighting you let me explain you a little bit this way Jesus was not created from heaven [Music] when Jesus was born okay they were looking for a delivery room I'm trying to help you so the way you are born and the way Jesus was born there is no difference foreign Mary was in person so there is no difference between you and Jesus as a man as comes as far as what he concerned the birth I want you to get that so Jesus was also on the belly so when Mary was moving Jesus was there just like you I'm saying that so you can absorb because you see look Jesus I mean Jesus I mean Jesus no no no no no no he was like you okay Jesus they had the baby bottle and they were feeding Jesus and Jesus was crying and they changed his diaper [Music] you don't understand me they changed the diaper of Jesus Christ they gave Jesus a shower just like you now you begin to understand Jesus was crying also I'm hungry I'm hungry I'm hungry and they say wait the food is just about we're going to bring it to you okay they say Elizabeth and Elizabeth goes Jesus me mommy is cooking they did also for Jesus [Applause] okay okay okay so he was a human 100 percent [Applause] the Bible said he can enter the water in his mother's womb and be water can he go can we go back again to the maternity Jesus said that's not what I'm saying amen if you miss if we miss the part of the word amen Jesus said I wanna check you all of you are flesh with spirit I don't see your word part I don't see your Divine part so therefore you must be and by the way in either way you must go back again to this thing everybody okay now to be born again you already fulfilled the flesh your mom and your daddy already took care of that so to be born again you must know what you miss what you miss is the world so to be born again you need the word to give you birth are you following me are you following me that's why the Bible says being how not of water because you already did that [Music] not of corruptable seed but of what to buy the water word of God in the beginning what's that word Jesus is telling you now I need to go back to what Bethany so you can make contact with your word be born another corruptible sin Battlefield corruptor by the water word of God which how living and water this Jesus here we know that his name is Christ Christian amen amen open John 12. Lord help me it's amazing this church I have more than 60 something called and every time you touch five seven I don't know what to do go to 12 please don't worry it's a loading we will continue to pump it I told you you will smell like the message laugh like the message talk like the message walk like the message and everything you do will be the message that's my objective until when Jesus looked at you he says I am the message who are you the message come on let's go home because he can only match what is like him that's why you got to be transformed by the renewing of your mind everybody okay John 12 if you're there you can say Amen verse 32 are you there my friend and I if I be how from the earth will draw water so when we look at cases like this with a Pentecostal understanding we think that somebody would take Jesus and but look what the scripture says verse 33 he said signifying what what he should water die so Jesus is telling the Jew that I'm gonna die but the way I will be dead they're gonna Lift Me Up what does it mean stop right there okay keep your finger right there go to John 3. the Bible says brother Branham say the Bible says what Abraham say the Bible say brother Branham says go to John 3 please if you dare you can say Amen verse 14 if you dare you can say amen and as Moses did what the serpentine water even so must the son of man be water everybody okay let's go back where we were we okay now so Jesus was telling them that how the way Moses took a a breast serpent put it and lifted up on the pole that's the way I'm going to be lifted up in other words I would die the death of the cross are we okay we okay now now let's go back where we were verse uh 32. the Bible says Jesus say verse 33 this he said signifying what what that he should water die stop so this man Jesus the flesh he can die follow me carefully before I dropping to brother brother amen this man is mortal in other words he has a beginning and he also have a he has a beginning and he also have a water okay watch carefully verse 34 are you there brother Robert goddess the people answer him because the people knew that he was crushed cross means the Messiah it means God is living in this man now the man that we thought is God begin to tell us that they're gonna kill him the Jews got puzzled they say wait a minute God be killed listen to me carefully verse 34 that people answer him we have heard out of the law that how Christ about this house forever we believe you are Christ but crystals crust doesn't die how can you die let me help you now with my board the Jews are telling Jesus is saying here everybody see me Jesus here Jesus here says that they're gonna kill me did you say wait a minute we heard that does now so the Jews have a difficulty now understanding crust in human flesh Jesus was telling them this man is gonna die destroy this Temple and I will raise it up in they say wait a minute you the cross but how can class die the Lord said Christ the baddest Christ is Melchizedek he doesn't die he's there he has no beginning of day no ending of life he has no father no matter he is eternal how can we kill Krishna now we confused Jesus Christ verse 434 the people answer him we have heard of the law that crossed the bird of house forever so her say you the son of man must be water lift it up in other way there is two son of man Jesus was telling them one of my son of man is gonna be dead they only knew one of the son of man which was the word they say wait a minute the word will die the son of man but today we understand son of man is Christo and it's the flesh we okay he says the son of man must be lift up who is the water the Jews got confused wait a minute we taught you the son of man but you are saying you're gonna die but the son of man cannot die so now which son of man are you talking about everybody okay everybody okay another word the son of man the word doesn't die amen but the son of man's flesh is subject to death the son of man flesh have the beginning and the ending but son of man word have not beginning no ending but that word was made flesh another word in Jesus Christ there were two son of man this is not Pentecostal teaching body amen there were some of men word and some of men flesh the word was made in other words the word and the flesh matched together that's why brother Branham say Jesus is 100 man and 100 percent that's why Jesus could cry and then he turned around he said move the the stone Lazarus come out the one that say Lazarus come out is the world [Applause] are you following me the one that was crying my friend my friend my friend Elijah that is the stretch are we okay let me drop brother Branham now glory to God brother Branham he said he came right down the water regular land means spirit and then and then flesh but we did to the water we bypass our tea or furnace everybody okay from attribute before the foundation of the world his name is put on the land's water book of life then from that he became the water and the water that could appear in the water disappear and then he became water flesh and returned back again resurrected that same body in a water glorified condition but you bypass the water and became a flesh man and then if this athlete Tabernacle is dissolved we have water one already I will show you what does the tea of honey do to you okay we have not yet the water what are you trying to say listen to me now please if you would take the Old Testament prophecies concerning what the who Messiah was to be you can compare it with the life of who Jesus Old Testament and Jesus in the New Testament and you gathered exactly who Jesus was he was not just an ordinary man he was how God wow he was changed from the supernatural let me get here then I may read it this way can everybody see me okay let's read it this way he was God changed from the water Supernatural form of a man he was how God manifested in flesh well in water watch again God in Murphy a morphe immoral mask in the water pillar fire god in morphe in a water Man Called Jesus God is in his church God God the water [Applause] are we okay are we okay William Marion brother that is the reason his disciple water couldn't understand him because of this mystery did I say you speak in water she was sometime do you see why I prefer you with the scripture so now you can understand brother brother if I never done it you will be part of what brother Branham is saying he not the word brother Branham is a Torah scriptural prophet a Vindicated message a Vindicated Prophet that is perfectly in line with the Bible everybody okay everybody okay that's why you can never separate William Branham from the Bible the message and the Bible are everybody okay let's go that's why that's the reason his disciple could not understand him they say you speak in water he was sometime Jesus and sometimes the father speaking any problem he said that is the way it is with you if you are filled with the Holy Spirit any man that is filled with the holy spirit says speaks that he hardly knows sometimes what it is saying if he's truly how get away Spirit that's why you say things and it happen and you say oh my God I was just joking and it happened it is not you that spoke you have not understand how to turn on and off yet but you getting to that you're gonna get to that have you ever heard someone telling you call Brother Abel and you call Brother Abel and brother Abel say Hey brother Chris I was thinking about you he was not Brad able he was not brother Chris he was the word in Brad Abel that was communicating with the word in brother Chris don't worry my friend you are growing up okay listen to this brother pranam he says that was not Jesus talking to who Abraham now you understand what brother Branham say in other words that was not the flesh the man of Galilee because in Genesis 18 Jesus was not born here amen that was not Jesus that was talking to Abraham there that could discern the thought in who Sarah's mind that was not water Jesus he has not been water borne born but he was who Amen in water human flesh that Abraham called water you okay now Elohim the Great Water great Almighty yeah Jesus said I he was in the days of Sodom and the days of Sodom so shall be at the coming of the water when the son of man is water I'm gonna get to that if the Lord is Lord Lord help me Hallelujah listen to this we have had the revelation of Son of God but the last promise to Abraham that was before the son or brought into existence the one that had that he had been promised before the promised son showed up God manifested himself dead at Sodom as the what prophet being made and water in flesh God who Elohim as I heard someone speaking a while ago which is which the God had water was in water he was the water Elohim is water the fullness of the godhead everybody okay watch where I'm going Lord help me this Melchizedek let me get here this Melchizedek was not water Jesus he was who God what Jesus what made Jesus and God different slow down Jesus was there Tabernacle that who well it's in [Applause] are we okay now are we okay now yes sir yes sir he says Melchizedek Jesus had water and water but this man never had a father or a water Jesus had the water and he had the water but this man had no water father no water no water beginning of day or water but he was the self same person it was Melchizedek and Jesus was one but Jesus was there Earthly bodies bold and fashion after water God's Own water body and fashioned afterwards to take away what to pay the ransom and receive sons and daughter and water himself you get it that's the reason he had the beginning and the water but this perfect water [Applause] in commemoration as the earnest of Resurrection go God will not suffer the holy body to see what we're talking about the flesh because he created it house himself and brought it forth and resurrected and said it it is what right hand Lord help me glory to God when Jesus was manifested in the water let us not the Flesh in there the word in the person of water not the priesthood but the person the water for this man Galilei had not yet been but he was in there the word so he had no father no water he was God himself he was manifested in the form of a water man they call him king of water which is king of water which is king of water he was who melchized he had made the water father no mother beginning of this oh ending of life he was Jesus Amen in the form of a water man then he was made actually what human flesh number three and dwell among us Emmanuel God dwelling with us in the person of who Jesus Christ born of who Virgin Mary number three he come in that form so he could die and went back into heaven now in this last day he has promised to manifest himself in the fullness again of his what but how in the spirit any question if you fool us stop because I have not started the son of man if you fool I stop here because if I dig down I have if I stop here I'm gonna change the title because I have not touched the son of man reveal because that's pretty deep let's stop here my friend it's a lot of food I'm gonna find a different title for this and we're going to come back Lords willing on the son of many reveal if you don't understand this difference you're gonna get puzzled in the message amen God first at the beginning it was the word and God later on was made flesh amen and you need to understand God and this God here is the son of man amen so when we say the son of man is coming we need to know which coming and which son of man is coming everybody okay that's why I'm gonna go I have to stop here because what I have after this what I what what you see here is heavy okay you already got a lot let's block right here recognize Who You Are you are from the family of the world and the boss of your family is above everything in heaven everything on the earth and everything under the Earth and you are part of that family and he died he worked and he did everything so that you can benefit from the work that he did as a father he worked and he laid out the treasure he left you a big bank account so that when he's not there you don't go hungry you use his name go to the bank that's why brother Branham say that God give us a check with the name of Jesus Christ written you need to fill up the checkbook amen you need to recognize Who You Are you need to recognize that you are under the head ship of Christ because you cannot have authority if you don't know how to submit to Authority that's why the Roman centillion say I'm a man and so before he can exercise Authority he need first to be under Authority so we must come under the authority of the word first when you reposition yourself in under the authority of the word then you now have the authority of everything that is under the word because that's what your boss that's what our boss that's what our father our husband did everybody okay so God put pressure on him so that Mordecai can wake Esther up and say Esther you're sitting there keep saying I'm the queen I'm the queen I'm the queen I'm the queen and somebody is disturbing the kingdom all the time somebody's destroying your family all the time and now he's trying to wipe your children to wipe your ankle wipe your entire family and you're sitting there just telling people I'm the brother I'm married to King of hazarus I Am The Bride of king of Hazard I am married to ringer Hazard I don't think you're gonna Escape if you're looking at your uncle dying in the hospital and you happy if you're looking at your children bats leading and you happy if you're looking at all the Havoc the devil is creating and then you happy is making a fast in your family and you happy fine Deliverance will come from somewhere but who knows who knows if that is the reason why you were kept for La audition who knows if that is not the reason why God crept you and brought you first in the message so that through you You're Gonna Save the whole race of your family who knows as they wake up you don't know who you are amen and Esther begin to explain what you and me explain all the time but you know if I go to the king I'm gonna die they say nobody can go there she didn't know who she was she was talking like anybody going to the kingdom who are you first of all to start saying that if I go to the king they're going to kill me you forget that you're the Bride of the king so you think the king will kill his own wife you see how low Esther got you see how low we got amen and he put Esther in desperation and when the Esther came out of this eruption she said if I need to die I'm gonna die when she entered was she killed the king say ask what everything up to water in other words my kingdom was divided in two it is you who are sitting there not exercising what do you want Queen Esther what troubles you what is wrong ask anything [Music] and I would do it why are you letting this Heaven play around tell me who it is we will get to that second banquet one day and you'll see where amen was who was begging did you see him and begging the king go search the Book of Esther did you see amen begging the king huh amen begging way where Esther was lying on the bed in other words Esther relaxing and the devil crying please have to take my life and that stuff is holding like this this is the day this is the day because she did her party everybody okay everybody okay let's stand let's stop right there Church These are stuff to position you because if you don't know your position you're going to be confused there is a lot of depression in the message churches because people don't know what the Holy Ghost is they don't know how they don't get the Holy Ghost they don't know if they are safe or not they don't understand everything they are puzzles they don't know who they are amen the time has come that we gotta clear the smoke you go to stand boldly and speak to the devil there is a difference between boldness and humility boldness doesn't mean you're not humble and humility doesn't mean to somebody who work like this okay that is your humility humility is to be able to Humble before the word okay so don't bring your kind of humility okay somebody might be here and say God bless you good morning that doesn't mean the humble that is our human humility and somebody must say hey man like brother Wayne Lawson preaching it doesn't mean the brother is now he's a humble man but he's booked that is not proud that is not arrogancy that's boldness to know who you are we must make a difference between that everybody okay if you want to fight to the devil you don't fight him like say it then please in Jesus name would you come out that's not humility that's a message humility wear a pair of jeans every day then that's humility that's your humility your Prophet there how is he wearing what kind of tire is he wearing about the tie he was humble so our humility doesn't mean she don't wear a suit that is our message humility get that out of this out of here okay the humidity is to humble yourself whether you have a Jinn you have a spirit of humility whether you wear a suit you are a spirit of humility and the one who ever suit and took Sado and the one who have the pereth overall we can hug one another and we are happy that is humility everybody okay if you want to go in the junkyard do you want to get a car that's fine if that's what you can afford but it doesn't means that you humble because your car is from junkyard that is message humility if the Lord gives you an ability to go buy a brand new car go buy it thank God and put that air conditioning and be happy that is not proud pride is a spirit who is more humble than a pope who is more humble than a puppy but Brothers but the scripture say he's the Beast so give him humility go see her Catholic please speak may they Lord God Bless you that's what you want not in this church I am who I am [Music] and I'm gonna preach how I preach and I'm gonna preach the way God Made Me [Music] if God Made You quiet to remain quiet if God made me this way let me be this way humble quiet humble bold we both humble let's pray Heavenly Father Lord we are approaching you humbly this afternoon father thanking you for your grace for your love and your mercy and for everything you have been doing for us father thank you for speaking to us and clearing up the smoke so that your children now can understand the lordship and their position in Christ and the authority that has been given to the church so that the church can exercise the power and not being like priests who are walking who are servant are riding the horses that's one of the things that Solomon saw and he troubles Solomon he says that I have seen praise the servant riding and then the children the princes are walking because they don't know who they are because the devil the religious world the Dogma decrees the many camps and doctrine of man that Rose in this message the people until they don't even have a scripture where to send on father I'm not the only one I'm not the only people on the street oh no on the beach we are many but father we just one of them that we are trying to uphold this message so that your children we recognize who they are and when we fully understand that your prophets say then we will go father may we stand Toe to Toe with the Devil no matter what is going on father the church don't know it has been a month or two that I was walking with a burning foot and I was preaching here with a burning foot [Music] the chiropractor saw me but the foot was burning father I prayed I committed the body unto the hand and I continued to work with a burning foot preaching with a burning foot until today I don't even remember when was the day that burning foot was gone and my foot is perfectly good and perfectly fine because of what you're doing father no matter what it is give your children faith that they can stand father remove everything that is petty in the life of your children may they realize that we are called for something higher something greater than this and you are depending on the church to show the manifold wisdom because the intent you have is to display your power through the blood you saw by Moses to destroy the amalekite but none of the people were able to destroy them even David they were about to they they escape generation after generation until Esther rose up and destroy the last seed of the America father may we be those Esther of the same time that can rise and stand for our families and like Abraham forget the symptom and crime our loved one claim our healing claim everything refuse the mediocrity [Music] because the name we are using is sacred it is our name we are entitled by birth we have a right to be called The Bride of the Lamb father touch your children touch those that are streaming help them Lord and father the announcement I made this morning father may you protect this church under the blood and know what the devil has been trying to find a loophole somewhere but I'm claiming and I'm declaring publicly this church didn't start by a man and this church is not directed by men it is not me it is the holy ghost that is standing himself for the message of this hour [Applause] [Music] protect us [Music] protect this church may you give discernment so that we can understand one another hearts and to see beyond the flesh that we are family of God father folks give us for every shortcoming forgive us for crying like babies now help us to manifest that which you have opened to us protect us throughout the week and give us travel Mercy and may our conversation be Center about what is positive and the things of the kingdom and nothing that is negative nothing about I didn't hear that I was not aware really let we put that aside in respect to the Holy Spirit in Jesus precious name Hallelujah God bless your church we love you [Applause] [Music] reveals [Music] face to face [Music] yours what have I deserve says [Music] [Applause] [Music] we're gonna sing it again [Music] here there is [Music] [Applause] [Music] I'm so glad I'm apart of the families I've been washed in the fountain
