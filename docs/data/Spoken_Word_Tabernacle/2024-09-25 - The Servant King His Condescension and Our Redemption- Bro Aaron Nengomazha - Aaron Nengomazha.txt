together for good almost every day where I stop it looks like an go home the spirit of the Lord open up something I was just sitting there reading The Book of Leviticus and here something open up in the book of memory right there I saw it a little bit of work and I sat there while they're singing and here it come again so God want me to get that before we can move so we have the whole package

the Lord is cleaning that up again until there will be nothing down deep in it and it will be nothing but God glory to God hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah don't forget the question and answer for

are safe father we find safy in your name we find healing in your name we find comfort in Your Name Lord God you bind the hearts that are broken and father you comfort those that are mourning Lord in a world that is polarized you say look unto me ye ends of the Earth and be ye saved father we know that you know climate is charged you people pulling from this direction and politics and all these things we know that they are showing that we are at the ends of the Earth but you are still the same and you said I shall be with you I shall be in you even until the end of the world father we are so thankful that you are with us tonight Lord but we don't we don't want just to invite you like Simon the Pharisee we want father to entertain you we want to wash your feet with our hair Lord we want to wash your feet with our tears grant us the privilege tonight uh father may they be Lord preeminence of the Holy Spirit Among Us may you just move in our midest we commit this service into your hands take the minister and set him aside uh and father just be the one to speak tonight to your people we ask these things in the name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ we pray amen amen God bless you you may have your seat thank you so much musicians greet you in the name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ uh so happy to be back in the house of the Lord yes this is our second home amen and we are so privileged to have uh uh brother Stephen who is a wonderful pastor and a friend and uh just you know giving us opportunity to be able to speak through his pull pit and uh we so many of my friends they say brother Aon you are so privileged I say yes I'm privileged to be to be close to him Paul was a wonderful man but if it wasn't for people like gameo he would not have learned some things that God wanted him to learn so when we have a wonderful men like him close by it's just a wonderful privilege amen so we could stand for uh uh for the next uh for the reading of the word if you have your Bibles let's open from the book of Philippians chapter two yes sir amen I'm going to start my time around right now am am you know me I preach the message of the hours but sometimes the spirit will carry you sometimes the the Spirit Carries you Philippians chapter 2 if you have it let let's start from verse three yes sir let nothing be done through Strife or vain Glory that's right you know there is Glory that is vain that's exactly like a lot of Glory that we see today you know with the internet with it's it's it's glory but it's vain that's exactly you want you want the real glory that is the glorification of our bodies that comes through the word amen amen but in loneliness of mind let each esteem other better than themselves if you are talking to brother Steven he will make you feel like you're the greatest depress cuz he probably know he read this scripture here like brother Bram used to call uh L Dr L he was not a doctor that was just brother brandham he will make you feel good look not every man to his own things verse four amen but every man also on the things of others amen verse 5 yes sir and I want you to pay particular attention yes brother let this man be in you which was also in Christ Jesus that's who being in the form of God thought it not robbery to be equal with God but made himself of no reputation that's and took upon him the form of a servant yes my brother and was made in the likeness of man in being found in in fashion as a man he humbled himself yes sir and became obedient unto death even the death of the Cross am wherefore God has highly exalted him and given him a name which is above every name yes sir that at the name of Jesus every Cancer will bow every sickness will bow every blood pressure will bow of the things in heaven and things in Earth and things under the Earth every demon power every principality every spirit amen you may have your seats hallelujah it's a teaching night tonight so I hope you don't pull too much supposed to be a little bit of teaching so we want to talk about the servant King condensation and Ascension yes my brother amen condensation and Ascension yes sir condensation and Redemption whichever where you want to put it it will it will be the same right so let's also go to Isaiah chapter 53 it's a very familiar chapter so that you know we lay the background here cuz we are talking about Jesus Christ tonight but when we talk about Jesus Christ he is not complete without you because men is part of the godhead right amen because you cannot talk about Jesus without talking about his church am because his church is part of him yes that's why the prophet says she is him amen Isaiah 3 the Bible says here sorry the Bible says yes sir surely he is let's yeah surely he has born our griefs and carried our sorrow yet we did esteem him stricken smitten of God and Afflicted and he was wounded for our transgression and he was bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we are healed amen amen amen am me verse one it says who has believed our report and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed amen so if you read the scriptures if you read Isaiah and Psalms you know the Bible refers to Jesus Christ it uses different titles yes sir sometimes it says my servant in whom I'm well delighted amen but we know that he is a king that became a servant but we are the opposite we are the servants who are becoming Kings Hallelujah by realizing who we are that's it amen let's read habac chapter uh the third slide chapter 2 verse 13 very sorry for opening a lot of scriptures but I should not apologize for that behold is not the Lord of host that the people shall labor in in in in the very fire and the people shall be weary themselves for very vanity for the Earth shall be filled with the knowledge of the Lord amen with the knowledge and the glory of the Lord as the waters that cover the sea the Revelation is not going to be a cup it's not going to be a trickle it's not going to be a Bor it will be so much knowledge and revelation as the waters that cover the sea Hallelujah if you go if you don't mind go to Ezekiel chapter 47 verse three the Bible says and when the man that had the line in his hand went forth Eastward he measured a th000 cubit and he brought me through the waters and the waters were to the ankles that's right that's the first stage yes amen amen hallelujah and again he measured he measured a thousand and and the waters were to the knees that's right that's the that's the second stage right brother I'm not going to preach on this but I'm just laying a background here amen and again he measured a thousand and brought me through and the waters were to the loins yes sir amen the waters boys remember you have to know the context sometimes Waters represent multitudes and people that's right but sometimes Waters represent the Holy Ghost that's that's why the Lord said to the woman at the well if you knew the gift of God and who it is that is speaking to you that's right I would have given you these Waters that's right yes sir in afterwards verse five he mer thousand and it was a river that I could not pass Hal hallelujah hallelujah it shall be a river yes sir there's a song that we used to sing some time ago says it shall flow like a river it shall fall like the rain it shall rise as the Jew in the morning for the knowledge of the Lord shall cover the Earth in the day that the Lord shall pour out his spirit and this is the day that we are living in because the prophet opened the Bible and we have received the mind of God we have received the perfect interpretation of the Bible that's right through Divine Vindication hallelujah amen so Jesus Christ he was Sav here he was a servant so but he was a servant though he did not start as a servant because God remember in the beginning he was El Elohim he was the self-existing one and the the prophet uses the word self-existent which what Elohim means that's right because he had to be self-existent because there is nothing here that lives that is self-existing here on the earth there is no energy I I don't want to get into science cuz I don't want to confuse people there is nothing that is self-propelling in in in Infinity uh everything if you light a candle it will die out that's if you start a car the gas will run out that's right but there's only one thing that is self-existing self fueling into eternity and that's L Elohim Hallelujah and the scientists the reasons why they don't believe God because the science they believe you have to explain everything you have to explain the origin of everything and the central focus of science is everything has to be explained based on origin and the dimensions that we live that's the problem amen that's problem where did God come from who created God but if God was created then he would not be God because anything that is created cannot be equal it cannot be eternal so God could not be created because the moment he's created he ceases to be [Applause] Eternal so you cannot explain God at the level of science because science assumes that for something to exist it has to be created and it has to be be somewhere because you cannot have matter without space so if it was created where was it and you cannot have matter in space without time but Genesis says in the beginning God created in the beginning time God created the heavens and the Earth matter hallelujah praise be to God God created the Earth it was existing in his firmament so God had to exist outside of these things for him to be God so the prophet says in the beginning there was no space there was no molecule there was a great spirit and this great spirit was called L Elohim Hallelujah when people people try to draw it and say it was it was it was inside it was not inside anywhere because it cannot be inside anything because there was nothing that could that he could go inside it was God himself the Fountain of Living [Music] Waters Hallelujah so God could not be created because he is in finite and because he's in finite he is eternal and being in finite means he has to know everything because you cannot know everything unless you are infinite Hallelujah so being infinite it makes him omniscient which means all knowing and because he is own knowing it means he knows what is happening any time everywhere every corner because he's all omnicient so if he knows everything that is happening everywhere that makes him omnipotent that makes him [Applause] omnipresent and the prophet says it does not mean that God is everywhere it simply means that he knows what is happening everywhere because God is not in a beer somewhere he just knows what is happening there and because he is all knowing that makes him all powerful which is omnipotent which means before you pray God knows about it before you kneel down to pray God knows about it before you went into a problem God knew about it before you asked God he knows about [Applause] it but for God to create things he had to change his form because you cannot be a father and remain a bachelor for you to be a to to be a father for you to be a father you have to give up being a bachelor you cannot be a father and a bachelor at the same time [Applause] the moment you you become a father you cease to be a [Applause] bachelor and the son that you bring forth your child will never see your Bachelor [Applause] days that's why the Bible says no man has seen the father no man has seen the father because you cannot see your father as a bachelor the moment you see him he automatically becomes a father so when God created he automatically had to change his form to become the [Applause] logos so each time God manifest himself in whatever form you see that is called Jesus because the only begotten of the father has declared him hallelujah praise be to God praise be to God slide number eight Hallelujah the Bible says here let this mind be in you thanes which was also in Christ Jesus who being in the form now the Greek word form is in mou who being in the form of God which means enor the because the word Theo means god theology theocracy theophilos that's Theo is Greek for God in Hebrew we have el el Elohim so L is is is Hebrew for for for for Theo in Greek so the Bible says who was in the in the mhe of Theo in the form of God he thought it not robbery to be equal with God but made himself of no reputation and he took him the a morare of a servant that's so when brother Braham says it was God and mor that's that's what he's talking about here it was God changing his [Applause] form Hallelujah and the Bible says he took him upon the form of a servant and he was made in the likeness of a man and being found as a as a being found in fashion as a man he humbled himself now the word humble is cannot cease Hallelujah which means he empted himself and he became obedient to death the prophet says William Marion br hallelujah amen no we'll come back to that to the word kenosis because you see there are there's there are two principal themes in the Bible Hallelujah there is in Mor but God in Mor is through kenosis was kenosis it means that he's not taking something and putting in something different it means he's emptying his entire self into something it's God changing his form so when God comes in the church he is not sprinkling something it's kosis in the [Applause] church Hallelujah so so Jesus he changed to you become a man which is kenosis amen it's a Greek word hallelujah but there's a word that we don't use Hallelujah because it's not in the western it's not in the western understanding of the Bible amen the word is called theosis yes yes sir I'm going to delete it because I don't kosis is God coming down to become man but theosis is God does that so that man can be transformed and get the glory of [Applause] God [Applause] hallelujah because the prophet says God became men so that men can become God so he was a servant but he was a king so which one is which it's called kenosis my [Applause] friend because when John was weeping he was told fear not the lion of the tribe of Judah has prevailed and when he was turning to see the lion what did he saw he saw a lamp Hallelujah so the lion represents the King the lion represents the king brother that's what John saw as Jesus but for him to become a lion sir he has to pass through the lamp hallelujah hallelujah hallu because you cannot have the lion without the lamp so when we wear these bodies because we bypass our theophanies we are taking the form of a lamb but our true identity is Kings wo thank you [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] Jesus he has made us [Music] what hallelujah amen Romans 12: 16 I'll come back amen the Bible says be of the same mind one towards another mind not high things but cond and send to Men of low State be not wise in your own conent so when we are walking in the earth we are walking in humility because that's how Redemption happens was brother BR made a favorite song and it also happens to be my favorite song and it doesn't have to be your favorite song it won't make you less spiritual if it's not our Lord was a carpenter but all disciples were not Carpenters so it's okay right we all don't have to be fisherman and hunting no no no be who you are Peter never said I write unto you Saints in Capia you should do a capentry classes no sir no sir he never say that there's no Cent mentioned in the bible no I mean after the gospels his favorite song he sometimes he says two says I like only believe like down down from his glory but many quotations you say my favorite song is down from his glory and whenever he would visit Martin Bose he would ask someone to sing that song says brother Bram is here let someone sing his favorite song and he says you hear that that's my favorite song Amen I didn't know that it was always my favorite song until I came up to that quotation and I like the verse because one one of the vers says is what cond ation bringing us Redemption because Redemption comes through condensation because Jesus Christ when he was going to the Cross he took his disciples and he says if one of you is to be great I'm going to show you how to do it that's because condensation brings Redemption yes sir you don't help people by go pulling them up you help people by going down to their level that's what Redemption is if you want to help your children if you want to help your wife you want to help your husband come down don't go up come [Applause] [Music] [Applause] down don't say why is it you don't understand this why is it you don't no no no no say go down to his level go down to her level and say I understand what you're going through I understand because you when you do that you start to P you start to climb up because it's condensation that brings [Applause] Redemption that's why you could not distinguish Jesus from his disciples that's why they had to hire Judas to kiss him because did not know which one is Jesus someone had to identify him you could not distinguish him he was not putting on a Gucci suit he was not putting on a expensive pants he was just an ordinary man but in that ordinary man there was 100% the fullness of almighty God oh thank you Jesus [Music] [Applause] he was just a little bitty man but inside of him there was power that could create another world inside of him was enough power to destroy every [Applause] [Music] devil and Paul says uhhuh bring the clock that I left at throwers uhhuh and the parchment especially the parchments says make haste to come to me before winter you never said you know what I'm a messenger I've got power I'm going to speak jackets into existence he was a seven King you are King but you are living like a servant but the servant does not mean doing anything or being pushed [Applause] around being a servant King does not mean you just let demons come into your house or just let things happen I'm just humble you know no no no no no no it means you just wake up in the morning you do your chores you wash your dishes like anyone else but inside inside there is deity inside there is the power of almighty [Applause] [Music] God hallelujah Hallelujah amenallah the prophet says you know when someone says something evil about you and you want to take it up and get angry about it that shows you haven't went quite deep enough with [Applause] [Music] God big men don't do those things that's what made him God to me he was able to condense himself he was big he didn't have to notice their little scoffing he had a purpose he had a work to do and that was to fulfill what God had sent him to do and he was determined to do it he didn't care what anyone said amen oh this brother said this I don't care brother I'm an eagle I fly higher I'm an eagle I fly [Applause] higher so so we have got two extremes we have people who think if you become a king you're just going to do everything push everyone around sir that was not Jesus Christ he was quiet he was humble he was lonely and then we have another extreme who say brother just be humble brother we are servants and they don't know who they are you become Pious like the pope that's not [Applause] humility so God there is that incate balance because man was made to be God men was made to be God that's why the Bible teaches that's what the prophet teaches but the difference is it's God the small letter G which means we are one in him in substance but we are not the same in essence which means because people go also on this other extreme which is Lucifer which is Ezekiel chapter 28 Isaiah chapter you know I can't remember the chapter I shall be like the most high you can never be like the most high and then others go on this other extreme I am just a man but we have to look in the Bible and say how do we bring a balance [Applause] you are a God but not the god that receives [Applause] worship the reason why people re resist the teaching is because they think you're going to receive worship no that's an [Applause] [Music] error it's like a it's like a wife you call husband my Lord but the Lord is interpreted Master but you call God my Lord and the Lord is interpreted [Applause] Adon it's different friends that's why the prophet uses the word amateure God because he did not want to stumble the Pentecost [Applause] [Music] [Applause] amen hallelujah praise be to God and the prophet says here am brother sing down from his glory how many loves that song Let's see your hand just remember that's my favorite himym now we spoke about that now he says here now I may pronounce that word wrong but the reason I spell it is when if if it tape is released the people who the scholars you know when when when in Mor the prophet Sayes that's slide number 12 says uh he changed himself he came down now the Greek word there means that something that could not be seen yes sir yet it's there then it's changed and the eye can catch it that's John 1 verse one that is is interpreting Philippians that we just read amen and he says now now when when when it said here that he emptied himself or ped out now we would think like this that he vomit up the English word or emptied or ped out from him see something went out of him that was different from him that's what we think but the word kosis in Greek does not mean that he vomit up or something his arms went off or his his eyes went out another person amen he changed himself he pulled himself into into another mask into another form not another person went out of him so brother Bram after the seies he begins to preach it begins to preach yes sir the baptism of the Holy Ghost and he tells people I'm going to I may not have time to get the CES but I'm just going to Glide over them he says there's only one form of eternal life that's exactly right and he says if you are Eternal you are you were always Eternal this is English this is not even complicated the word Eternal means something that is unending if something is an eternal it means it had no beginning it means it had no end that's so really you can say I received eternal life but that would not really make sense if you receive eternal life it means that life is no beginning and no end so if it is given to you it means somehow you had no beginning and you have no end which means you were existing with God and you are a part of God that's why the Bible says you are a [Applause] God hallelujah amen don't I know where people stumble say brother are you saying I'm like Jesus you are Jesus in a portion because Jesus was the fullness of God God but all of us as the bride we become the body of Christ so so all of us the the body we become the body of Christ so it's Christ working in a many M [Applause] body glory to God Amen am amen amen amen amen amen the prophet says in slide number 18 he says he come down to show what God was anything that's high and hurt is in God God is low and humble that's what made him God see something that comes low amen so what made him the Messiah was the ability to condens sent now the prophet says the difference between us now I'm going to clear the confusion right with people take your time amen one okay sorry if you're a young man you have to wrap it off because you're not so the prophet says one difference between us and Jesus yes sir is that we bypassed our theop yes sir that's one difference there we bypass our what there is the word again what Theo amen because Theo means god and funny means to reveal to appear so theop means it's God appearing [Applause] friends [Applause] [Music] Hallelujah so the witch of endo when she looked behind the curtain she said I see God but we did not come in that form we bypassed that [Applause] hallelujah it's not God to be worshiped remember this because you see teaching is working on thin eyes if you're not careful you know you go down so you have to it's a it's a delicate [Applause] balance amen am amen and veiling of God now remember between the Son of God in laia they put him out and look he said he would be reviewed again as a son of man amen the prophet fulfilling the rest of it am the scripture tie perfectly together son of man Son of God Son of David what was it is the same God all the time just changing his form and more fair yes brother he changed it yes it's a great drama to him amen he is acting it out amen now the word Redemption does not mean replacement it means you are buying something and bringing it back you are restoring so where is God restoring us to because remember Jesus came in Three Sons right he came in Son of Man uhhuh Son of God yes sir right and he came in Son of David yes my brother amen amen hallelujah so so so a son of men he was a prophet that's exact and and and a son of God he was a a priest that's exactly he was a priest exctly otherwise you would not have an atonement through the church ages and the son of David he comes as a king right that's why even us we operate the same anointings and the reason why Solomon had a jubilee is because he had these three anointings in harmony he had Nathan the prophet he had zadok the priest amen hallelujah so so but when you when one thing is missing it's a disaster in judges they did not have a prophet which is the son of man and it was a disaster one brother said my brother my a friend of mine from from IR land he said when brother Branham spoke to sister maida about the issue of the Tuma says you have disobeyed God didn't like that he was speaking as a son of man and he says everybody likes to do that to say you should not do this you should not do that that's a good anointing no this brother is wrong but the prophet here to climb down and say Lord forgive my wife she did not mean that was Now using the anointing of a priest so a house that operates by this one anointing it's a [Applause] disaster if you operate by this one alone it's a disaster because a king Hallelujah who did not become a lamb it's a dictator they were given a kingdom they received [Applause] [Music] [Applause] crowns that's why David before David could become a king here to become a shepherd Hallelujah so whatever we are going through right now is preparing us for us to reain because we shall rain upon the Earth as we are reigning in [Applause] righteousness because adoption is based on conduct when go when Jacob blessed the tribes amen he says Reuben I'm not going to give you the birthright of the first born because of your conduct you thought I didn't know it I'm a prophet you went up and you took my wife you are unstable like water that's exactly and the blessing went to Joseph because God could not break his word hallelujah and he says Joseph is a fruitful B and his branches they liap over the wall hallelujah praise be to God so the prophet saying it's a great drama because Jesus is the only one that could qualify to be the king of kings because he is the only one that could condent from being a logos am our our our coming to the flesh is a tiny bitt fraction amen so in the great Millennium in the future home we re as kings but we lay our crowns before Jesus because he performed the greatest koses hallelujah amen we cry you now yes sir you Reign Victor Hallelujah high and lifted up worth is the lamp Jesus Son of God rer of Heaven crucified Worthy is the Lamb Hallelujah worth is the lamp this evening worth is the lamp in the highest because when you get to heaven you shall receive a crown and in that Crown there will be stones and these stones are the souls that you led to the Lord so all of us have a limit but there is only one that can claim all the all the stones and all the clowns his name is [Music] [Applause] Jesus so we are Gods but in part in a measure but unto him he was the fullness of the God he had [Applause] [Music] B hallelujah praise be to [Music] God you say but brother Aaron how then do we how is it that we become a portion take your time because remember when we say Jesus is the fullness yeah Jesus is the fullness Hallelujah now he had a body and this body was on the cross amen but we know that when he was on the cross when when Abraham met MEC Levi was in his Lo that's so when Jesus Christ was on the cross when he was in the beginning we were already in him so when he went on the cross we went on the cross with him so election looks to fall [Applause] knowledge so us as individuals cannot be the fullness because we make up the body of Christ so he alone is the fullness but we are a measure but when we put our measures together we form the body of Christ that's why Paul says according to the measure of Praise You know some are the eyes and you know we come through different ages come through W some came through Wesley some come through the the the the lips age but now we are in the age of intelligence artificial intelligence prophetic intelligence amen hallelujah so he is the fullness of of God yes sir now remember Jesus Christ uhuh was called the second Adam yes sir because you have the first Adam that's right and you have the second Adam amen right so so Adam is the same as Jesus how many knows that cuz why would God say he the second Adam but but we don't but it does not mean we worship Adam this is this is where people the devil plays a trick in people's minds so we we say Adam was a type of Jesus but for him to be a type of Jesus he had to have a portion of [Applause] Jesus that's why and this portion is written in the book of life it's chapters in the [Applause] book some are in Malachi chapter 4 somewh in Revelations 10 so it's portions of the book so our members were written in the Book of Life and the entire book is called the word of God and the word of God is [Applause] God so you are still part of that word but you are a portion of that word [Applause] So Adam could not be deceived because he was the son of God right and the prophet says that Adam Paul says in Timothy that Adam was not deceived but the woman being in the transgression was the one who was deceived because Adam was a perfect Son of God Amen because Adam was made in the image and likeness God Amen image and likeness right yes so Jesus Christ comes to to become the second Adam the reason why why is Jesus Christ doing this because he's restoring men to come back to this because Adam was the god of the [Music] earth that's the Bible I'll read you the quotation that's the that's exactly the message [Applause] because if you read the message Christ is the mystery of God revealed the prophet says Christ is the three-fold purpose the the first one was to reveal himself so reveal himself number two was to have the preeminence right the third one was to restore the kingdom amen amen now to restore the what theom the kingdom Kingdom amen so what is a kingdom it's a compound word it means a king and in the domain right in the domain right take your time take your time that's why God had to redeem the Earth amen because it's part of our domain that's so so God came to reveal him himself in revealing himself in Christ he wanted to have the preeminence in the body that's why he said unless the the corn of wheat in the ground it abideth alone so what he was saying was that in him the seat was brother Steven Hallelujah in him was brother Aaron in him was all of these people but they were in the form that is called the jeene seed of God and the only way that they could come up was if they go in the ground because when the Greeks came to Jesus they said says we would see Jesus and Jesus answered them you want to see Jesus you want to see God you cannot see God I'm now in the the message says would see Jesus they wanted to see Jesus but but Jesus who is Jesus they wanted to see God in a way so Jesus answers them and says except a con of wheat falls to the ground it abideth alone what a strange answer go ahead brother so in other words he was telling them the only way because remember we say that kenosis or inor is something that cannot be seen But now is appearing so he is telling them for you to see Jesus I have to die on the cross and the Holy Ghost is given when the Holy Ghost is given you are going to see Jesus and when you see the church you see Jesus when you persecute the church you are persecuting Jesus [Applause] [Music] [Applause] it's in the message says we would see Jesus so that is the only way they could see Jesus in the form that they wanted that's why even he himself in that form he could not give life because he was not yet glorified that's what the Bible says and and and the prophet says what it says the Greater Works was to impact eternal life and the prophet says God he has no Feit he has our feet God has no hands he has our hands amen so restoring the kingdom is is restoring what Adam lost that's exactly right which was the domain which was the being that he was like God am but that doesn't mean that he was worshiped but he was in the form of God now remember remember the prophet says now here he says they remember they control the Earth he was an amateure God that's right for he was the son of God and the Son of God is an amateure God now that ain't contrary to the scripture I know that sounds strange slide number 24 the prophet says I know it sounds strange amen notice he separated Eve and Adam and she fell Adam went with her Adam was not deceived Eve was deceived amen but Adam the first Adam was God's son also and he went out because of the love of Eve amen let's continue reading but you see the prophet says here now but you bypass the theophany and become flesh yes sir men to be tempted by sin amen and then he says now and if this a tabernacle is dissolved we have one already waiting we have not we we have not yet the bodies so in other words the prophet is saying if the reason why we bypassed our theophan was for us to be tempted that's exactly because if we would be in our theop then we would not be tempted because Adam could not sin because he knew who he was and he knew what was what he was doing but when Christ comes he's restoring us back amen that's what the message is about is to restoring us because remember when the lamp came forward yes sir to open the seals yes sir he was claiming what he redeemed because that was the only way that man could be restored back EXA and he says it is sown a natural body it is raised a spiritual body there's a natural body and there's a spiritual body and so is it as it was written the first Adam was made a living Soul the last Adam was made a quickening spirit now Romans chter 8 verse 29 give me 5 minutes 10 minutes for whom he did for for no he also did predestinate now what is election brother says election is not saying I choose this I don't choose this that is not election it's it's a bit hard to explain but for you to be a Jew you have to be born a Jew for you to be a Shambo you have to be born a Shambo now that doesn't mean that brother Shambo doesn't love me I just wasn't born a Shambo right I'm not his son because I was not born a Shambo but his son is a Shambo because he was born a Shambo and the only way he could be a Shambo is if he was born that way and the only way you could be a Jew is if you are born a Jew that's why you cannot join Judaism sir and if you read the book of Acts the Bible said there were people who were outside the temple who were God-fearing people this was a title which was given to Gentiles who wanted to become part of Judaism they were called God-fearing people they could not be called Jud uh Jews because you can only be a Jew by birth that's right and the only way you can be born is if you are on your father's loins so the only way we could be born again is if we are already in God having predestinated as Ephesians 1:5 unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of his of his grace wherein he made us accepted in the Beloved amen so so so the second difference is that there's only one who is beloved that's Jesus Christ there's only one who is begotten that's Jesus Christ but we where how where do we come in we are accepted in shame because remember let's read the prophet says Hebrews chapter 6 to Abraham and his seed singular so Abraham is one seed God has one seed where the promises plural were made yes sir Abraham and his seed now the Seed of Abraham was one which was Christ in prefigure Isaac so there's only one seat in fact brother Braham says God does not even want to see you you'll kill you he only sees Christ he only sees Jesus and the only way we can be accepted is if we come in sight of Jesus which we are a part of Jesus [Applause] [Music] hallelujah oh my and the prophet says to find to finalize it I like this because I'm closing also to finalize it in Galatians 3 he identified the seed singular which which with Jesus andc counted the seed children as the children of the promise amen and promise is having to do with election or choosing of God which we spoke about that and that is exactly what we have been saying these who are of the royal seed are the elect of God are the predestinated for n of God and we're in the mind of God and his thoughts go Amen in the in very plain language the true bride of of Jesus was in the mind of God eternally though not expressed until each came forth in the designated decreed season as each member came forth it became expressed because we said funny means is to express and mor amen and it took place in the body Hallelujah thus this bride is literally the spoken word seed bride and though she is fine this is where the balance is though is the though she is femine in in designation she is also called the body of Christ it is very apparent that she ought to be called that for she was predestinated in him came from the same Source was eternal with amen and now manifesting God in a many membered body whereas once God was manifested in one member one seat even our Lord amen now the prophet says now the only way you can be a son a daughter of God is because we have to have eternal life and there's only one form of eternal life that's God's life only one form of eternal life that was God there to be you have to be in him oh always the gene of your life spiritual life so you were always Eternal so that's why the Bible says you are Gods because you were you could not be otherwise doesn't not make sense how can you be Eternal amen you've got to be Sons and Daughters of God you've got to be born of God and God is the word when I become part of my father I become all my father when you become part of God you become read with me church when you become a part of God you become slide number 35 slide number 35 thank you let's read it again when God when you've got to be Sons and Daughters of God you have got to be born of God and God is the word when I become part of my father I become oh my father when you become part of God you become God in full his whole world you believe it all and watch watch the title of the message spiritual Amnesia by by the grace of God we are taking the spiritual Amnesia we are showing you where you come from we are showing you where you were when God came to job he says where were you when I laid the foundations of the Earth when the son of God shouted for Joy that's why you are shouting tonight because you are shouting eternally with him uh God bless you Church brother stepen hallelujah amen let's stand upon our feet if you are Eternal now you will always Eternal with him amen you share his DNA he cannot deny you because he will be denying a part of himself that's why Adam could not let go of Eve because they were one in the beginning male and female made he them amen May the name of the Lord be blessed May the name of the Lord be blessed give me the next slide if you don't mind play something softly do you believe it amen the prophet says you don't have to stay what down there say no you are free that's right he died in a place to take away your sins you just believe on him flop your wings just fly away with the rest of them don't stay in that pit of the devil nor sir we we now the president asked brother Bram will you lay your hands on me and the prophet says will you lay hands upon me and free from that go to next slide please sister dear or brother dear sure I would lay hands on you but that wouldn't free you what would free you is to understand that you are already free you are already United you don't have to worry about being free there was a there was a there was a a man who had a farm and he was troubled by by crws that would come and eat his crops one day he tied one of the crws the prophet talks the story Johnny the craw and he was hungry he was beaten down he couldn't fly and the others would come and say Johnny let's fly some South the winds are coming winter is coming let's fly south says I can't fly I'm bound but he says but they came a kind man and he untied Johnny the CR and with the other cross the Eagles come and says let fly south let's eat from the deep things of God says I'm bound I can't believe that I'm come from the denominations I come to tell you tonight you are free you are already free you are free from denominations you are free from Main M's ideas you are free from denominational understanding of the Bible let's fly south let's Fly Like an Eagle let's fly in the Heavenly Hallelujah let's fly where eag goes there Hallelujah are you ready to fly this evening I don't need to lay my hands on you you are already free the Prophet says you just have to accept it you just have to accept itth say Lord I am free just accept it and declare it when you declare it then it happens God is waiting for you when the prophet saw the storm rising up in Colorado as a man he says I'm going to go back and run away the prophet says go back and face your problem and you speak to the storm and the prophet says the Bible says he said You shall say not Jesus but you shall say you can speak to the storm of your life if you believe it tonight God is here this evening let us bow our heads and pray Heavenly Father we thank you tonight Lord for your word we thank you for the prophet Lord who revealed these things to us Lord we we see father our position Lord and we know that many times that the devil wants to destroy us through ignorance for that's the Great and oldest weapon through fear and ignorance and you says my people perish because of lack of knowledge but you read the scripture where we say that the knowledge of the Lord shall shall be abandoned as the waters that cover the Earth and you say to the son of man Ezekiel measure again and he said I measured the waters until I could not swim in them I could swim in them it was too much water we thank you Father for the messenger that came and he broke the prison door doors and the the the the the the doors and the gates that were holding the Holy Spirit at the rivers of of of of

you can because of the depth that goes with this is this the first time you preach this yeah honey what was I doing yesterday in the living room till 2: a.m. I was working on the sermon and if I pull my computer and I showed you you will be amazed this is the whole Holy Spirit this is the spirit of the [Applause] Lord do you see why God pushed the break sometime on Sunday amen so he bring a Ministry to get the Lord so we can sore forward Amen brother Bram say that God is not for you to forgive sin there we go I gave you the code here that belongs to Jesus sir it's unbelievable praise God Amen you are free free by understanding it's written there it's written there free by understanding it's a quote right there how many times I talk to people in the counseling and I don't even pray for them and they say I feel so good am because what we got used to is you you talk you talk and you sit and then you say now come down kneel down and then you start in Jesus precious name no you shall know the truth amen amen and the truth will set you free amen amen we can lay hand on you you get healed but if you don't understand what God is doing you can continue to be troubled by the devil and before you know it you would depend on a preacher to always be there to come and lay hand on you by the day you understand the key formula then it's a different story that's why brother BR made even a statement he said if Jesus was right here not if me if Jesus was right here brother Bram say if you see him he has nothing he can do for you because he already done it how can Jesus say blessed are those who believe without the disciple saw him but we are called blessed more than the disciple because now we are worshiping Christ not in flesh in the spirit in the Revelation amen what a masterpiece brother Aon you need to come back for part two I don't know for you to me it was like he start preaching he had to lay the foundation then he start preaching so I don't think you even preach tonight you just started amen amen it brings such a Clarity in the message and then the message now become comestible easily it looks like they took the bone and they crush it and now you can just uh eat the bones and everything and we can move forward brother God richly bless you I'm not going to add anything you just take what do me a favor because these things are deep even if you in church they deep whenever we preach on Sunday go back throughout the week and sit down maybe on a Monday or or or Thursday and and listen again and you will see more if you take this sermon you go back again and you begin to go one by one you will be even amazed things that were there and you could not even see the problem is not you could not even see it you were already filled then after a while the spirit opened up again so you can receive more so don't get the habit of listening to the sermon and go and then you don't hear the sermon again no God will unold especially these type of things it will help you a lot it went through our families and through everything the man the the the the the what God and David and everything it's like a package Oh Glory to God brother God richly
