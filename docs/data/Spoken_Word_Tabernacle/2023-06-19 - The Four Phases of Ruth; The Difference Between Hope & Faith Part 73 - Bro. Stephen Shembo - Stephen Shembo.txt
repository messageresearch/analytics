right okay you promise Brother David the microphone that are in the on the chandelier just increase them so we can get some amen going on Amen the sound is clear okay we greet you all in the precious Name of Love Lord and Jesus Christ both visible and invisible audience amen we have a big invisible audience oh my God brothers and sisters wherever you are God richly bless you and once again welcome to spoken word Tabernacle amen anybody who's a family member here because we do not have visitors God richly bless you and welcome and we trust by the grace of God this will be a blessing to you to all the fathers that are here and the future fathers amen Happy Father's Day amen do you know that a pastor is a father you know that butter brother Branham says sometimes I preach pretty rough because I see that somebody is getting out of line can you say Amen you see you are supposed to do that when somebody's getting out of line you come up and preach hard a real daddy will if somebody's getting out of line a true daddy we correct it brother Brian I'm saying why he shake you and say here get back here in line if he is a what a real true water so sometimes your pastor has to weigh down on something just just do it because he is a water to you you see trying to keep you water because he's watching over you which the Holy Ghost has made him the overseer of the and you must always watch so if I don't correct you when you go in other line something is wrong amen so a true father will always always try to do that amen so it's Father's Day and it's my wife's birthday foreign and we appreciate everybody I bought some cake and the young sister and the whole VIP ancestor were able to come so they started the party yesterday in my house so after the young sister's meeting we went home and Cut the Cake and sing Happy Birthday and the gift and everything so I am saturated and I told them that even though even if I don't receive any gift your presence is already a gift so just seeing you being there it's what's matter amen you know my wife told me a story this morning that her uncle one of her uncle told her my father-in-law took so long before he can have a baby so everybody thought something was wrong and people were making fun of him and everything so the first one that came up was my wife amen so when that came up it was like a miracle because everybody could not believe that this doctor finally is going to have a baby so the day she was born people were bringing gift amen so my uncle my uh uh big brother to my father who was really really really close to my father he also was around there so he came later I don't know if it's two weeks later or something he came to see the baby because everybody was talking about this baby this man was not having a child and finally he came so when he came he bought also his gift can I continue can I continue but when he bought his gift he brought the gift and he spoke to my father-in-law my parent-in-law and tell them that I'm not bringing the gift for the baby everybody okay he says that I'm bringing madari and I'm claiming this baby that one of my children will marry her may his soul rest in peace because he's already passed away but later on Dad the Lord I was born in another city she was born in another city down the road whatever he spoke happened [Applause] the way we grew up we were catholic if a Catholic can say something [Applause] and later on it happened how much more message believer everybody okay [Applause] oh my God it's getting juicy amen Glory Glory Hallelujah I'm sending I'm bringing greetings from Brother Brian Nadu some of you knew that he was around here so we communicated with him I believe it was an April and I told him by the time he get here on April he need to let me know so that he will be able to minister for us but by the time he got here his schedule was already booked to preach everywhere so there was no opportunity for him to do it I tried to see if there could be any changes in his schedule no he had to leave on Friday so he he was booked to preach everywhere except here so he sent greetings brother Kelly sent me the message so he's greeting the church and Lords willing maybe in the next opportunity when the Lord opened up the way he will be able to minister to us so the reason why I'm saying that somebody might have a question why he preached here he didn't preach here I know how to shoot the devil everybody okay so I'm giving you what happened so maybe God's willing if the Lord Terry and he doesn't come in the near future when he come back orchestrate everything the best way amen blessed be the name of the Lord how many are up to date with the sermon how many listened to the sermon on prayer everybody clear on prayer now you know how to pray you know how to pray so there is a strong pull for me to continue because we stopped at Hallowed be that name now we need to get to that Kingdom Come that will be done because that was the mother prayer so you need to negotiate with the deacon to find out when I can come up quickly to do it because my schedule is getting really really loaded quickly with with things that we have to do concerning the church amen how many are reading their Bible every day you're reading your Bible in the morning and in the evening brother Branham say a Christian should read their Bible one chapter in the morning and one chapter at the evening I have a quote for that if you don't do it please make sure make this a priority every day in the morning one chapter before you go to bed one chapter amen amen in addition to that you have your Cod you have your church ages you have the seals and all of that put them together that's the way you will grow amen I'm a pastor I have to do that if I'm real daddy everybody good so far amen glory be to the name of the Lord for those who are waiting on music part three just be patient we will release it the as soon as we can Lord's willing on June the 24th this month I believe it's next week we have our question and answer amen so remember it's 2 30 you know the secret place where we have it it's already open so we see you there at 2 30 the last question I will receive that on Wednesday and then we move on Amen any question so far we had a wonderful wonderful wonderful young you heard them saying already young Sisters Meeting we have to speak more than four hours you want to know what we talk about sure do you wanna do you want to know we talk about sexuality more than four hours because I don't want to have any problem down the road with what I see across the message we got this cell phone in the hand of children amen the 11 years old they got this they're 10 years old they got this whatever they're doing here you don't know everybody okay so when they start pornography at 10 years old and they get married at 30 or 25 there is a lot of stuff that have been downloaded in their mind amen we talk about going to heaven we talk about this we talk about that but we don't touch what is really needed for them to go to marriage like I said yesterday we usually tell the young sister to keep themselves virgin but we don't tell the boys and I gave you the quote brother Branham say even boys Brother David increase my my volume please everybody okay even boys are supposed to remain virgin [Applause] can you say Amen because the majority of the time it's the boys that Baxley and they go into the world and they do all kind of stuff over there everybody okay when they finish they don't come back empty to learn a lot of garbage over there everybody okay and they'll say brother Stephen I need to rededicate my life and we're gonna re-baptize them when they came out of the water they still have that knowledge over there and they're going to take that knowledge and bring you to our young sisters we need to know what we need to do and what we are not supposed to do we are different in our talking we are different in our living we are different in our Behavior we are even different in our sexual relationship I gave every quote and every scripture what brother Branham spoke about it amen I took the scripture I took the message and I took science and I mixed them together brother Branham and I gave you two quotes yesterday there was one that I didn't give you brother Branham say he took science the scripture and the message and mixed it together and bring the subject everybody okay I went I downloaded that in detail because we need to know what we're doing especially people that get married nowadays if you meet your wife in a nightclub what kind of Life were you living when you get converted your heart changed but the thing you learned there did you remove them what was right what was not right because the knowledge of sex was introduced by the serpenter so you need to we need to gauge up don't worry go to Second Timothy I don't play a game with the Devil yeah I don't play a game with the Devil if your pastor don't touch these things fine not me second Timothy no you can be seated that's not the scripture for it I'm sorry I appreciate the second Timothy chapter 3. let me lose somebody's feather if you dare you can say Amen second Timothy chapter 3 job to verse 16. because when we start talking about this kind of stuff somebody's blushing somebody's trembling somebody's holding the chair somebody say Pastor leave it leave it leave it leave it and the people are suffering I have people even outside this message and many people you know do you know how many people struggle with pornography second Timothy chapter three if I don't get to my message fine at least this one will help you second Timothy chapter 3 verse 16. if you dare you can say Amen my buddy you got your scripture your microphone praise God good to see you amen all water scriptures is Water by water inspiration of Hope in other words every scripture that is written in this Bible comes from who so there is no scripture in this Bible that doesn't come from God can you say Amen the difference is God gave it to men and men put it down so everything that is written in this Bible you are under obligation to say Amen [Applause] everything everything even a Karma even a punctuation you are supposed to say Amen can you say Amen every scripture is given by inspiration of God and it's profitable for water in other words for teaching karma for water Kama for water and for water instruction how in other words we need to learn things the right way where do you have your knowledge of

I've been in this message for a while and I know the religious spirit in the message a religious hypocrite spirit are you there Leviticus 15 verse 18. I can give you more scripture than this but I'm just giving you this to losing somebody if you don't say amen I will continue to load okay I'm loaded Leviticus 15 Verse 18 if you dare you can say amen amen the woman also with whom men shall do what with the seed of water with the semen that's what the Bible says they shall both bathe themselves in water and be unclean until the water is this scripture inspired yes or not [Applause] what are you trying to say God in his word he talked about sex can you say the man if God who is Holy in his word he can talk about sex who am I [Applause] we try to be more spiritual than God oh don't talk about the subject God in his word I can give you scripture after scripture your head will spin brother Brown I'm talking about sex I have the quote I gave it to you yesterday so take your first holiness get that out of this church we need to clean up our marriages we need to clean up our life [Music] brother Branham even say the reason why he talked about sex is to put limitation on what is good and what is not good I gave you the quote yesterday continue you're telling the Young Sister Stay the way you are she protected herself Here Comes somebody with a bunch of tattoos he get converted and we take him and give him to the young sister boy I need to sit with you I need to clean up some of the stuff you learned you are not marrying a prostitute you marry a child of God what you did after there with the prostitute don't bring it to a child of God Say Amen [Applause] brother Abel get the patriarch together please I need to download this material five hours okay if if somebody is not there cancel the meeting and don't come there for one hour and you work out you have something you need to stay with me five hours do you hear me do you hear me don't if you have an appointment cancel that me and you let's sit five hours I'm gonna pull the Bible I'm gonna pull the message of the hour and I'm gonna get through science I need to clear all of this but able get the young people get the young people together the young man okay get them together it will be me you and the Deacon yeah okay the young sister I had to have my wife and the two deacons wife the young men bring it to me okay okay buddy yes sir okay and we're gonna whip the veil completely because the devil is putting this garbage to 80 years old with pornography [Applause] and when I want to talk about it and tomorrow we're faking stuff young sister you're ready for marriage don't worry they're ready for marriage they are ready I need to get the patriarch quickly when I finish whenever married people you are ready let me know okay so we sit together and we'll talk we need to clean up stuff I will give you court and I'll give you scripture everything from the Bible and from the message of the hour everybody okay everybody good so we can walk differently I even showed them yesterday how you can bring a demon on a husband and pull him out from the Bible they know that brother brother Kelly remind me every quote I use yesterday even the quota didn't use I'm gonna print them out you give me the number the speaker of the house give me the number of for the sister I will print out every quote I will give it to you you take it to your marriage [Applause] amen let's go to a scripture every area that's in French I don't have the game yeah I don't play with the Devil a young man don't know how to keep money and we let him continue like that I need to sit with you and we need to talk you need to know how to save money so welcome to spoken word Tabernacle we talk about everything brother Branham spoke about the investment yes I have scripture I have quote so I won't sit here telling you though you receive the Holy Ghost receive the Holy Ghost okay you already received the Holy Ghost what what next since I preach you 30 in 30 years if you receive the Holy Ghost receive the Holy Ghost if you dare you can say Amen by the brand I'm saying you should love me more so if you don't love me you you have a problem with the messenger [Music] you want me to put that code back again let's go to mark 11. I'm not playing games if you think you know everything wait till I rip the scripture open and you would notice God made the difference between his people and those that were not his people even the Jews in their Anatomy were different than the Gentiles because they were circumstances oh thank you very much let's go to mark 11. there is capillary I forgot yesterday he came this morning you remind me when we start the next young sisters with it and you tell me and I will add them up amen Mark chapter 11 verse 12. if you dare you can say amen I kept the same scripture because we did it we were unable to touch anything I mean on any of them and on the moral when they were come from who from Bedtime from Bethany he was hungry you might be seated Jesus was not looking for something spiritual uh no problem and on the moral when they were come from Bethany he was hungry this hunger is not a spiritual hunger this is a desire that is natural it is a desire that is connected to the body everybody okay he was not looking for he was not hungry for the word because he was the word amen he was not looking for spiritual food that's not what the Bible said Jesus was looking for something natural something that can perish something something that can perish something that is temporal something that if you put it on the table you wait two days it will rot that's what Jesus was looking for what I'm trying to say is the need that Jesus had was not a spiritual need amen amen you ain't going in the rapture if you don't get to what I'm trying to say and I'm saying that by the prophet you will understand me verse 13 and seeing a fig tree a pharaoh having leaves he came if happily in other words perhaps he might find anything they're wrong and when he came to it he found nothing but water leaves for the time of fig was not yet so Jesus has and had the need but it was not according to the season [Applause] [Music] if he was the season of figs amen Jesus would just went take the Fig and go what power is it if our God there is an apple and I pull an apple did that demonstrate any power God made it made sure that there is no fig in other words are you okay because if Jesus goes and it's the season of food and he found fruit and he eat he doesn't impress anybody it is normal there is no miracle everybody okay but the time that Jesus went was not the time it was not the season so the desire came out of Caesar [Applause] are you following me are you following me in other words the desire the natural desire came when the condition are not met am I reading a different Bible you will have desire and the condition I met I have 500 in my bank account I'm hungry there is a McDonald is that do I need to pray what do I need to do swap my card and suck my card why am I ordering because I know I got the money but there will come a time when you're hungry and you don't have money but you need a solution the condition are not appropriate did you sleep well did you sleep well I have a good credit never messed up anything my credit is 845. my income is three hundred thousand dollars and I want to buy a house of two hundred thousand do you need the miracle do you need a miracle what do you have to do go apply and get a house and move on are you gonna come back and say praise the Lord the lord gave me a new house you won't probably remember that unless you're more spiritual then you will say thank God for giving me a house and giving me the money but if your credit is bad and you don't have the money and you don't have a good job but something in you [Applause] is pulling for the house [Applause] the conditions are not met in other words it is out of season what do you do verse 14. and Jesus answered and said to eat no man eat fruit of you hereafter forever and his disciple did what so this power was released when the condition were not met that's why I tell you please read your Cod book when brother Branham created Square the word there was very bad I have the code and brother Branham say under that wedding no squirrel can come out that's the weather that God loses [Music] to produce Square in other words this power works when things are impossible [Applause] when you reach your limit and you don't know what to do and you are stuck that's when the power works [Applause] [Music] job to verse 19. oh my God Jesus Christ we can even stop here you go home 19 and when the evening come came he went out of the city verse 20 and in the morning as they pass by they saw the fig tree dried up from the water The Roots you remember last Sunday Jesus spoke and went away somebody was taking care of the tree it was not Jesus Jesus didn't put the camera there or a John and he went to his bed and put a camera and watched her the tree is uh is dying foreign ate his supper and wake up in the morning and continue to go he said these guys I know them let's go this way come this way again come this way again I know these guys I know this guy come this way again and when Jesus was passing he even probably was looking somewhere else and say do you remember when we went to Galilee and someone said hold on don't go too far watch this watch what verse 21 and Peter calling to remember us say to him Master behold the Fig Tree which you curse is water whether the way why Peter do you know that Peter represented Faith yes see me if you need the quote let's go let's go to verse 22 and Jesus answering to them have water safe in God what does he mean hmm you showing me something and instead of Jesus saying wow Jesus look he said have faith in God what does he mean in other words the result of what the disciples saw amen was caused by faith I don't know if you're kidding me in other words Jesus was telling them it is first that did this I might drop this If I Stumble you that's okay okay he was not demand Jesus that did it brother Branham said Jesus was 100 and 100. everybody okay everybody okay so Jesus was telling the disciple what you see there amen it is not human nobody came at night and sprayed some uh some chemical to kill the tree no faith can kill a tree [Music] what you saw is a result of what that's why he say have water in who God in other words I'm teaching you a lesson if you want to do what I just did there is one thing to do have water faith in God the disciples say okay so what is the next tree I'm gonna try Jesus say that was an example amen okay let me show you what that faith can also do we okay verse 23 for water verily I say unto you that water whosoever shall send Twitter Jesus remove it from the tree into the mountain because if he says tree the disciple will begin to hunt for trees he said let me let me show them that the same thing that can be applied to a tree you can you can change direction it's like a cannon you can turn it and give him a different Target and you send him where you want him to go if you say to this mountain be you remove and be you cast into the sea and shall not doubt in your heart so where did that Faith came out I hope somebody is getting that so it is not the one we diagnose that it's a faith amen one is a faith but we need to know where is that safe coming from now Jesus is giving us the clear description of the location where the faith is coming from number two he says that faith is where in the heart what is in the heart we okay but shall believe that

stop if you dare you can say Amen it is time to stop playing games of both I'm a message believer I'm a message believer slow down that's why other people are getting results everybody okay verse 15 you there let's jump to 16 because you understand for by who where all things water created that aware in heaven and that hour how visible and invisible where did they be or Dominion or or power all things were created by yeah and forth and he is before all things and by him all things do whatever so one person can create everything when there is nothing one person he creates everything if he create Angel if he create Throne if he create the universe if he create sudden Pluto Jupiter all of that where was all those materials they went away [Music] let's go to Hebrew 11. if you don't get to this rather Branham says if you don't have faith for Divine Healing forget about the rapture I have the quote brother Branham say that he said if you don't have faith for Divine Healing huh forget about the Rapture in other words what I'm telling you here you must have it before the rapture do you think it's easy to think that like I'm here I'm gonna change and be 18 years old is he easy it's easy to believe how am I going to change and go back how but if you don't believe healing how are you going to believe that I give you a hundred dollars you don't know how to handle it and you're telling me if you give me a million dollars I will know how to handle it reach down Hebrew chapter 11 verse one if you dare you can say amen amen let's go buy water whatever can I have another brother kill him can I have another one by faith and that faith is the water substance of water things hoped for nothing [Applause] let's stop a little bit please buckle up okay let's pray so I continue because somebody will say I have not prayed yet but it looks like I'm preaching Heavenly Father Lord we are approaching you again humbly this morning Father we thank you for your grace for your love your mercy and for everything you have been doing for us father we are committing this service unto that hand may you move me completely out of the way may you come and speak to our soul and bless us Lord father take us to a higher realm and remove every demonic spirit away from this place we bless you for this wonderful people and congregation in Jesus precious name amen you ready now let's read it again now Faith is the word substances of things what hope for before I go there the human body thank you my brother have three parts are we okay please please follow me make not my life your life easy by following destruction the human body has a soul then he has a spirit amen then he has a body everybody okay this body has five senses everybody okay we have C we have tests we have touched we have uh smell and we have also a hearing everybody okay the spirit also have five senses amen we have conscience we have imagination and so forth everybody okay they saw we found out that it's only one it's either Faith or it's what unbelief amen but if we talking if we question we must talk about faith and I'm gonna show you if I can reach where I'm going okay when we are born we born in sin shaping iniquity with Adam's belief everybody okay but there is a time where it swap unbelief must go away and you become a believer and then Faith enter everybody okay so let's put here Faith so there is one sense let me call it this way we got so we got spirit and we got body now let's read Hebrew one uh for Hebrew 11 1. now Faith where is faith faith is in the soul everybody okay fifth is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not water sin C is which sense are we okay so we see that Hebrew 11 chapter 1 is dealing with an element of the Soul are we okay it's also dealing with an element of the body so we must find out what is the element of the spirit if I lost you raise your hand we get the soul we got the spirit we got the body the Bible say faith belongs to the soul the Bible said the evidence of things not so we are talking about the body the Bible That's why when brother Branham described this brother Branham say the evidence of things you have not seen test in other words brother Branham say it is the five senses but Paul picked C and put it here the site everybody good so far now let's read over again the same Passage now Faith is the substance of things water hopeful there is a word they are called hope everybody okay we already got the body let me put hope here okay let me put here see everybody okay so Hebrew 11 1 is talking about your whole being Hebrew 11 1 is talking about you [Music] and it's attaching your soul your spirit and it's touching also your body have I lost anyone I'm reaping a layer buddy listen to this Lord help me brother Branham says that nowaday When you pray for anyone in a water humanistic we know that the soul is in the heart everybody okay and we know that the conscience the imagination and the and the affection all of that are found in the brain you remember you remember you remember thank you Jesus brother Branham say it even mistake we say well do what I hope you shall get it well see I'm open I'm believing with you do you see the way we talk brother I believe God will do for you hope you feel good so really you're not believing I'm trying to help you the word that you say doesn't come out just like that it is from the abundance of the that's what he said I'm hoping I'm believing with you trying to use all the water I can that is how humans when you say I'm gonna try with all my faith it shows you don't have faith if you have faith you don't try anything [Applause] everybody okay brother Branham say in the fundamental Foundation of for Faith he said remember last night the water the human and the water that's faith and the water Vision the human this is water oh don't worry let me help you out my friend in the interesting Spirit follow me carefully God has nothing to substitute faith faith is faith there is nothing you can swap for faith if you do either you have it or you don't have it Faith had no substitute hope are we together we will never take the place of water Faith so there is a clear difference between Hope and Faith but faith is the substance of things helpful let's go slowly my friend fifth is how instead how hope can never take its place hope is the substance of things hope for the evidence of fixed notes it all Faith water brother I'm not talking about faith I'm talking I'm hope I'm talking about faith hope is what faith is what another hope do what for it Fifth Water as God is are you okay are you okay I know everything will will go good don't worry just keep praying for me you are hoping you not you don't have it first and when you gather your language change [Applause] do you have a son by the name of Elijah is that a problem but the Charles Hamilton do you have a son by the name of Isaac is that a problem as much as he's a father he doesn't have Isaac hope is one thing faith is another hop hops for it Faith does what has got it in other words one is imaginary [Music] the other one [Music] [Applause] [Music] one is water intellectual thing intellect deals with water the brain and the brain is the realm of water spirit most of our faith brother Brad I'm saying amen is intellectual faithful and to let your faith is another name for hope [Music] So when you say I believe you really don't believe down in you you are hoping one is water let's go one is water intellectual faith and the other is a water direct revelation of God it's a never take water please everybody okay so when you have something you hoping for everybody okay you need to take that thing and push it to a different department are you following me there is a department called hope that's where you manufacture stuff I want to have a house I want to have a car because my car doesn't drive anymore Google that's your hope you manufacture the thing as long as you stay there you will never have that car [Applause] the only way you will have DACA you have to stop pushing for yourself You're Gonna Go borrow money to this brother borrow money to this brother all you doing is Hope [Applause] everybody okay once you finish your hope Department you need to ship the car to the next Department everybody following me you need to take the car and say me I have finished conceiving I have finished the manufacture the the the the the conception I already finished it now you need to go so that they can make you real [Applause] everybody okay the department that makes things hopeful real effects [Applause] do you follow me once your car leave hope and goes to faithful it is no longer intellectual everybody okay everybody okay was faith gets it Faith actually take it and say okay this is what you want me to make considered done see you tomorrow and come in pick up your delivery [Applause] how do you want me to preach this everybody okay the Bible says self is the substance because hope have no substance hope is the imagination but hope is an imagination that become crystallized into a substance but it is not yet seen by the body everybody okay everybody okay in other words you usually start first by hope then you must go by faith then faith will bring it to the human body can see it let's read the Hebrew now now Faith is the substance of things the evidence of things you have noticed everybody okay so your first Department you start with hope then you ship it towards faith and faith will bring it where you can see in other words Faith materialize [Music] Faith bring it to pass listen to this Lord help me Romans 8 24 the Bible said for we are saved by water oh the Bible said we are saved by faith it's inefficient now Paul is saying we are saved by water my brother Branham say hope is intellectual you need to read the Bible clearly please verify open Roman 8 I don't want you to think I'm reading something different open open Roman 8 please by the Kelly I'm still reading the scripture let me try it if you dare you can say Amen can you read it the Bible said we are saved by what in Ephesians the Bible said we are saved by faith and we say Amen now the Bible Paul is saying we are saved by what you need to know what kind of Hope Paul is talking about can we continue now watch what Paul says we are saved by water oh before I read this let me remind you faith is the substance of what things that are what and the evidence of things that are water in other words forever is the substance of the hope you have not seen everybody okay everybody okay Faith is the substance of something you hope but you have not seen yet they hope you have not seen yet its substance is faith is it complicated let's go back now Paul say for we are saved by water but hope that is what is not water oh so what is Paul talking about let's continue let's continue the Bible doesn't contradict itself for what a man why why does he yet hopeful are you ready but if we oh for what we want us I hope that you don't see it is called water hey so we are saved by water [Applause] if I lost you raise your hand [Music] but where if we hope for that which we have not see the hope of faith not sin is what so Paul is not talking about hope he's talking about faith a faith that have not been seen yet it is called a hope that I have not been seen yet it's called Faith then do we wait with water hey another word [Applause] you ready you ready another word when something leave the Hope Department everybody okay and get into the first Department Faith usually have something for backup it is so precious [Applause] you want me to stop faith is not just pure faith Faith inside of his software he usually have patience why because if you begin to get tested safe up and patience to quieten you down [Applause] let me explain it to you if you have a desire in your heart and you pray for it but you don't have patience you don't have faith [Applause] Hallelujah imagine the word faith doesn't only give you what you want no first one he get he first cool you down in other words faith when he entered he said what's the problem my son is sick okay cool down then we'll ask you you are quiet and your son is sick the reason why you quiet is not because you're strong [Applause] these faith that is quiet telling you [Applause] I might have to change the title because you don't even know the title yet everybody okay everybody okay the Bible says this in the Book of James chapter 1 verse 3 knowing knowing what that's the water off your water stop not your trying not your trying they're trying us they're not trying you you have failure but something in you need to be tested [Music] [Applause] Have I Lost You Have I Lost You Have I Lost You they're trying not your trying but the trying of your water [Applause] watch carefully the scripture the trying of your water do water workers patience in other words when trial begin once you pray if you truly had faith amen faith will wait as soon as somebody challenge him faithful will birth patients in other words when you have faith you say you know what I'm gonna have a baby if somebody come and say they already catch a tube Faith doesn't keep quiet [Applause] that's why Israel 40 years was trembling but when David came and heard Goliath David look he said you guys sitting letting him with his big mouth talking like that [Applause] fans cannot stay quiet [Music] as soon as you challenge him he will open up [Applause] another word when Trier approaches your favor first automatically dispatch patients [Applause] a man who has Faith doesn't argue [Applause] he doesn't have time for you he doesn't even want you to believe with him confess stand alone [Applause] [Music] [Applause] Jesus listen to brother Branham patient with what what kind of water patience first thing he has patience with water God if you get real increase your volume my friend let's pray let's preach like me and you if you got real and genuine Faith you shall have real genuine patience if you believe something and somebody said something against you and you begin to get trouble you don't have faith yet faith is unconscious of criticism [Applause] is a bulldog you're not gonna have it I will have it [Applause] because every tongue that will rise against me I will condemn it right here if what you're speaking is not according to my vision move out of my way don't try to block me [Applause] when I'm believing something if you don't want to believe with me be quiet leave me alone my faith is not your favorite don't block me [Applause] let it be done according to you [Applause] [Applause] [Music] I need to clearly Define Hope and Faith so you know what you got [Applause] you shall have real genuine water patience because fast do water work is patient when God say anything you do whatever that's all you got what is you say well I asked him last night to hear me and I'm just as sick this morning oh my what what God who Abraham and how many years 25 years there was not even water one side but he was still water with water [Applause] yeah [Music] faithful quieten your nerves Faith doesn't look at the time [Applause] in 90 years Lord keep telling people for 25 years old I'm gonna have a baby I'm gonna have a baby I'm gonna have a baby what is in that man what is in the man if he is a teenager we say yes you still young you're gonna have a baby this was not a teenager [Applause] Abraham what do you need I want to buy diapers diapers for who for your neighbor no for me I'm preparing for my baby [Applause] the people shake their head they say the old man has gone mad he turned around he said I'm not mad God said so [Applause] Jesus brother Branham say put him always where before you let him be the next water you can't cross him just keep him away he said and it's going to do whatever keep him out before you [Applause] listen to brother Branham faithfulness and water patience they go out go together oh yeah it's a combo you can't have faith with that person because if you have faith and your faith don't have patience your faith is going to be tested so God in the software of Faith he always put patience because God knows somebody will pick on you [Applause] God knows somebody will make you discouraged so when somebody begin to discourage you you will hear something coming up like ah I appreciate the brother but I don't think so I still believe God Will Make A Way [Applause] [Music] [Applause] he says if in fact patience is the water after my faithfulness foreign birth when deaths come you don't have to worry about it Faith knows what to do when you begin to get tested you will see something in you is calm like what keep you calm what keep you quiet [Applause] if it's hope don't play with me like that hope that hope if I can get where I'm trying to get if I can get where I'm trying to get you won't leave this church the same way you can he says the trying of your water hey shall remember the natural in you so learn to detach yourself from your faith [Applause] when you say something positive and people make fun of you don't get upset they are not trying you they're trying what you smoke foreign [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh Jesus the only Highway Romans 5 3 tribulation workers water how highly God we got this out working of our patient is seen in James water first but let water patience have the water perfect work that he may be water and how it's higher lacking water nothing God doesn't want you to miss what faith is bringing to you because if you doubt you can lose it so God loaded persons to make sure when you are tested patient is keeping you quiet right don't lose it don't lose it don't look Keep Holding On keep holding on it's gonna happen because God doesn't want you to lack nothing thank you Lord thank you Jesus listen to brother Branham he says God will God's will for us is what Perfection and that Perfection is water patience that patience is not your passion it is the patient of faith [Applause] not your passion get yourself out of the picture your patient has limitation they can push you at a certain time you blow up but the patient of faith never blows up traffic is unlimited faith if you think it's 10 he get to 10 he say are you tired keep bringing on Bring It On keep bringing them is this all you got go ahead keep bringing on [Applause] [Music] oh God he said God's will for us is water and that Perfection is weapon patience waiting on and waiting for God this is the process of water character development [Applause] sometimes you you are God something and then he gives it to you quickly sometimes you ask him something and he linger a little bit he wants to develop your character [Applause] but he loves you with passions so you can endure the trial and when everything is finished what a joy when a baby is born [Applause] of Mama all depends all the difficulties turn into WhatsApp status the baby's birth the baby's birth the baby's born [Applause] my subject this morning [Applause] you want to go home it's the four phases of roof the seed full coverage [Applause] you want me to go or you want me to stop [Applause] you ready you ready you ready you promised me you're ready Joe you ready praise God let's go we are deep very deep in roof chapter four we're dealing with the last phase which is the rewarding of roof which roof is in the holiest getting ready to disappear everybody okay and what we're dealing with is something that must happen to the children of God before the rapture [Applause] because John said now we are sons of God and he has not appeared what we shall in other words before the translation there is something that will happen to the children of God last week we demonstrated that we usually bring out our Redemption into part number one we bring the Redemption of the Soul everybody okay and then number two we're looking for the rapture which will bring the Redemption of the body and the changes of the body amen and according to Roman it's the same spirit that Rose crashed from the dead dwelleth in it shall also do what so when you get the Holy Ghost you already have the guarantee for the translation but the problem is between your time that you got the Holy Ghost everybody okay and the time that Jesus will come you still in this earth struggling with your body and having things that need to be taken care of so is the Holy Ghost come only to Quicken your soul and stay quiet until the rapture what else can the Holy Ghost do to you be sad sealing your soul brother Branham says he says that but brother brother I'm saying and that is what's the matter with you people what is the matter with the world they are living under the water because they think when they were born again people in position for every Divine promise the water God made so when you receive the Holy Spirit you are studying it is the beginning of your new exploration when you were born the one that was working on you is your human part your God seething you was always laying dormant when the Holy Spirit Come he will awaken the seed and that seed is awake now it is a New Journey for your seed to begin to experience the Natural Things of this world father help your children that's why John said beloved those that are in Christ the children of God the wife of God I wish above water of things that you may water Prosper this Prosperity is not your health come on let's read it together beloved I wish above all that you've made water prosper and be in water some healthy something else Prosperity something else [Applause] [Music] please open your Bible please open your Bible [Music] verify this because it looks like I'm using a different bubble because message believe a PhD when they say Prosperity yes God will heal my body no no that's not what God Said [Applause] call me all you want I have no Bishop to please the only one is the Lord Jesus Christ that's why I love this church I'm so free like a fish in the water a job here get here a job here get here job here get it all free enjoying my freedom in other words whatever the Holy Spirit bring if he loaded a shoot he loaded a shoot if it pleases another Pastor sobied if he doesn't please himself but as for me and this church the Bible says try the Branham Street [Applause] if it's in the Bible and it's in the message free from [Applause] okay you there turn John verse 1 chapter 1 it's only one I believe he said beloved I wish above water all things above all things so there are certain things but Above All Things [Applause] you already got some but above office hey bro please read with Me Above All Things after you have eaten after you have dressed yourself Hey Brother I wish [Music] what [Applause] I wish that you may water prosper and be water in hell so that this Prosperity has nothing to do with your health [Applause] [Music] [Applause] I wish that you do water okay and then be water in hell so God must be responsible for your health and responsible for your water this Prosperity is not towards your health in another translation it means I wish that you prosper in every aspect foreign [Applause] [Music] [Applause] don't worry I have a bullet and I'm gonna pull it sooner in maybe less than five minutes let me shoot a bullet brother uh uh John say I wish above all things that should do water and behalf in hell even as the water do water prosperous so this Prosperity is not the prosperity of your soul [Applause] am I reading a different Bible this Prosperity the prosperity of your soul is something else your health is something else it's prosperity is a prosperity for everything remaining beside your soul and your health [Applause] thank you are we okay another word Prosperity Health has its own Department so Health return department but this Prosperity has nothing to do with your health not with your soul in other words your health is prospering your soul is Rosemary but all other things need to answer thank you [Applause] take it or leave it as for me and my house [Applause] for me and my house we will serve the Lord [Applause] [Music] open to 218. let me load this bullet brother Robert you make it difficult for me to move let's go to Psalm 118 please make sure you got your Bible I want you to read it yourself remember their soul the Redemption is the Redemption of the Soul that's what uh John is saying here that he wants us to prosper as our soul see the prosperity of the Soul everybody okay so we got salvation of the Inside Man salvation that will change our body but there is another thing else you ready Psalm 118 if you dare you can say Amen job 2 verse 25 I want you read that food for me please you gotta verse 25 my brother you ready let's go now save women now David is talking about what salvation everybody okay everybody okay can I show you something on the board David is talking about what the soul serve when now not tomorrow save one now everybody will say Amen to that especially message believers let's read the remaining I beseech you all Lord oh Lord I beseech you sand now what prosperity [Applause] save now that's fine when I'm finished to be safe now send prosperity [Music] am I reading a different Bible [Applause] so this Prosperity is not the prosperity of your soul it is not the prosperity of your health it is a Prosperity that affects the remaining of your life father help me William Marion Branham we found out I'm repeating this because somebody had a question that last Sunday there was two stages we have a Benjamin Franklin stage you remember and then Thomas Edison change Benjamin Franklin stage was the Redemption of the Soul you can review that yourself and after the Redemption of the Soul which bring Delight you must have the application of the light and the application of the light is what Thomas Edison everybody okay my brother Branham says this in that quote somebody had a question so I want to clarify brother Branham say then he had a fellow by the name of Thomas Edison he was not satisfied with our garden he said if I gathered it's got water if I'm sad if I'm filled with the Holy Spirit I'm not gonna stop there [Applause] if I'm filled with the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost got benefits praise God because God wants me to prosper yes sir the Redemption is also salsa goes with the Redemption of the soul and the healing of the body but I need this other area thank you my salvation is covered my healing is covered what about my job what about my church what about my children what about my house [Applause] listen to what your boss just loaded to me do you want me to tell you what he just told me he's just loaded right now do you want me to tell you what he told me when Israel was living in Egypt the boss said that tell them I took care of their clothing I took care of their shoes their power that saved Israel accepted their clothing [Applause] the pillar of fire didn't just take them outside he took them I said he gives them water he gives them bread [Applause] that's right another one he was full of comfort amen amen [Applause] the Holy Ghost need to touch my car [Applause] somebody have his car stolen they come to brother
