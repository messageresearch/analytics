message wherever the message is the pillar of fire will be there if it's preached in its purity God will be there that's something for sure amen everybody happy tonight ah men over cameras on Wednesday God richly bless you after work tours and care and traffic all kind of things but praise the lord we here to worship God Amen there was a praise report that was given to me it's a family that has been streaming for a long time and didn't have a local church and they sent a message they say their prayer has been answered and finally they found a local church they were in the United States so we praise the Lord for that I'm happy for you because that's a wonderful decision brother Branham spoke about everyone having a local church amen amen it's very very very important I was looking at two wins in the New Testament and it's uh it's impressive the way the scripture opened up amen sometimes the decision we take ourselves can put us in trouble and usually you will receive a beautiful win that started when you take a decision when you go the wrong way there will be a breeze that will come and help you up a little bit and then you will be encouraged like what I'm doing is right and then the bad win comes even I've seen it in the scripture so you see people taking decisions want to do this want to do this you want to move want to do this okay fine at the beginning you're going to receive a breeze like everything is Flowing good you see I did it everything is good now it's normal before you know it there is a next win that is coming up I saw it in the Bible right there and I was studying studying I said my goodness amen and sometimes it's innocent people that are caught in there especially children and I feel so bad for children because sometimes they are at the mercy of the parent whatever the parent want to do they are forced to follow the parent even if the parent take a bad decision and then when they suffer everybody's suffering but thank God for predestinated sin amen amen glory to God so make sure before you make any decision check the word check what brother Branham is saying check what does the scripture say before I do what I'm trying to do to make sure if something arise you are in the vision and in the Revelation and when you are in the vision and in the Revelation brother Branham called that the postal the line of duty at that point whichever there will rise up you have a right to take him down because you are in the vision amen you know now the power of a vision without a vision the people live without restraint you're going to follow everybody you're gonna copy everybody you will be doing everything that everybody is doing because you don't have a personal revelation of what God wants you to do for your own life but once you find it no matter what is going on you're going to keep your lane no matter who's passing that's not your problem you keep your lane you know your speed limit you know where you're going because you have a destination that has been clarified by the holy spirit amen I am not preaching today one more praise reporter forget it brother Mark sister Angela's uh husband was taking a training for six weeks and by God's grace today was the last exam he passed all of them successfully and he finished the program amen so God is doing a lot of things it's like brother Branham say Bethlehem was a little place where God was moving in a mysterious way amen if we sit here begin to give testimony we will give one after the other one after the other all I'm trying to say is God is Will God is not dead He's Alive and he's still the same yesterday today and forever I'm not preaching tonight by the said coffee is preaching you know brother said his family is here children's here I told him welcome to your second home so let him preach like home we pull like home and we get Blessed Like Home amen only believe oh Lee believe oh we believe [Music] all things are possible [Music] only I believe oh please believe please oh believe [Music] all things [Music] [Music] the Billy Lord I believe Lord [Music] I believe of things are possible Lord I believe amen it's good to be here tonight by the most a group of Believers and I tell you I just uh appreciate the opportunity as brother Stephen said to come home tonight and I sure I sure have missed you since the last time I was here and just uh I told everybody I texted brother Stephen probably a day or two later and said I know you keep saying that you were blessed but I think I feel more blessed than anybody did just just being able to to be here and you know you don't get to see that a lot where people will pull on the gift of God and and really try to get something from God and you know that was a great service that that was but what a great service this is amen we have to we can't just live on a on a day going by but we have to have a new experience tonight we got to have a new feeling tonight that was great what God did a month or so ago or however long ago it was but but we need God to do something right now but but I'm glad that he's a God that doesn't change amen amen and speaking of that if you if you have your Bibles tonight I'm sure you do if you don't mind we're going to turn in the scripture even though we could all Quote it we've got a couple places here in the scripture but I'd like to turn first to Hebrews 13 8 amen Hebrews 13 8 and and I would like to take a text this evening if if the Lord would be merciful and help me I would I would like to speak on this text of I am the Lord and I change not amen amen amen thank you Jesus amen Hebrews 13 8 yes Jesus Christ the same yesterday and today and forever amen if you could turn to Malachi the third chapter in the sixth verse Malachi 3 and 6. say Amen when you have it amen I know somebody out there has it as brother Seth had it amen and it reads like this for I am the Lord I change not Amen Let Us bow our heads dear heavenly father Lord we've read your word Lord this evening father and what a powerful word it is God Lord I think it's beautiful father in that scripture Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever Lord you identify yourself there father you put your name in there father so we never have to wonder who the same is Lord but we know it's you father we know that every day that we wake up Jesus Christ is the same yes father we know that every trial we went through and everything we face you're the same Lord we know that every single day no matter what happens or what we have need of you're the same Lord we just want to say thank you so much for that tonight God thank you for being that kind of God that we can always rely on father and and know that you're always there father Lord you were there yesterday with our loved ones Lord on the days gone by our forefathers Lord and even with us and not so long ago and Lord today you're the same Lord and to know that tomorrow father you're still going to be there Lord what a blessing it is to know in our hearts father now tonight Lord You See Me Lord here father with with a little thought that you laid on My Heart Lord and Lord I'm so insufficient Within Myself God lord there's no way I could I could show what's on my heart to the people Lord unless you would come father and Lord I feel like Isaiah Lord when he said I'm a man of unclean lips oh God but father you had a remedy for that Lord God lord you had a way Lord of taking a coal off the altar Lord God and Father you would begin Lord to take that coal and and touch his lips father and purify him where he could speak father and Lord you said your God that changes not father Lord so I know God tonight if you could do that for Isaiah Lord you could do that for me tonight Lord you could do that for us father because he said I dwell among unclean people father and Lord within this flesh and Lord sometimes the the world father can rub off rub off on us when we're rubbing shoulder to shoulder with the world but Lord tonight we're asking you just to take a cold off the altar Lord God take your blood tonight Lord all the things of work and all the things we went through and all the thoughts Lord that are not your thoughts or every thought Lord that goes against you father we bring it down tonight Lord we bring it captive to the word of God Lord that you can have preeminence in this place Lord that that you could speak what you want to speak that you could say what you want to say that you could do what you want to do father well we don't want to just have Simon's party tonight Lord where you come Lord where you're invited with 30 feet father but Lord we want you to be the center of attention father we want you to be welcome we want you to do whatever you want to go in whatever room you want to go down every Avenue that you want to whatever you want to do father that's what we want you to do tonight Lord God and Father tonight Lord we say father forgive us of our shortcomings Lord and we just want to say that we love you Lord bless this service for your children Lord in Jesus Christ's name amen you may be seated now I'd like to speak on that I am God and I change not amen and you know I begin to think of that and and I guess something that that's been going on in my life and in everybody's life is is everything changes and everything's changing all the time you know I was just sitting there thinking about it today of how my daughter she turned four years old and she's she's starting preschool at home with her mom but but next year she'll she'll be taking on kindergarten and and then we'll have to decision to make their own making a change of trying to find her a little Christian School to go to or or or homeschooler you know there's always changes going on in our life you know we can see that that the seasons change we're in a time of Summer and people are praying that it would just change people people are saying it's been so hot and I just want to cool down a little bit but don't worry the change is coming it's going to change every everything is changing you know right now we have the air condition on but but in two or three months we're going to be begging to turn the heat on because because it's going to be cold because things are going to be changing in our life you know our children will go through changes as they get older we can see that that covid-19 made a lot of changes in in the way that we used to live life and in the way that we think things we do now when it happened it just changed a lot of things you know your job can change you might have a job one day you might have a job for 30 years and the next thing you know you're let go it can change your health can change we go through a lot of health problems and a lot of Health battles where where our health can change you know we've got friends and people that that we thought would always be there right it would always be beside us right but they've changed they've gone away and they're not there anymore I mean these human bodies were constantly going through changes and and you know you could even see this in a very plain way right there might be a place that you grew up in or a place that you like to go yes sir and you'll go back to to that place years later and you'll go this place doesn't even resemble what it used to be that's exactly because there's so much that has changed yes sir but I'm so glad that that in all these shifts and all these things that change yes there's a solid rock that we can stand on when when the world's change and when when people are changing when things are changing we have an unchangeable God Amen the god that said I am God yes of the Lord and I change not I mean I'd be going through changes you might be go through problems but whatever the change is where you know that your God has not changed amen amen there are many things and practically all things change brother man says time changes people changes weather changes Nations change but God is unchangeable he does not change amen he is still the same all times God is infinite God he's an infinite God I do not believe there would be any way to explain the word infinite because it's the infinite amen he has never had a beginning or he will never have an End Amen therefore when God is called on the scene to act or to make a decision listen the way he acts or the decision that he makes that is forever the same that's it he cannot change it because he's infinite he's perfect in other quote he said now I can make a decision and say it's going to be this way and I'm I'm fine I I will I'll have to change because things come up that I'll have to say well I was wrong but God can't do that because his one decision is that forever amen he cannot change his decisions he cannot change yes therefore if God's attitude towards one sinner that wanted to repent he's he's tying this in here he's saying if there's a sinner that wanted to repent and there was Adam and Eve and God made a way for them to repent and he forgave that sinner the next sinner that comes God has to do the same thing yes sir that sinner or he was wrong how he acted the first time Amen to the first Sinner and if man was sick and God healed one man and that there was ever another man comes to God he's got to do the same thing amen or he did wrong when he healed the first one amen I'm gonna tell you something God Don't Make Mistakes no sir if he comes on the same ground he said what a resting place then for the soul that's seeking Refuge listen his attitude is the same time amen that will take him at his word amen that's what it takes for healing or salvation yes sir you must have faith in God and God is no greater than his word amen for no more perfect in his word amen because God and His word is the self same thing you are no better than your word God is no better than his word amen and your word is what you are and God's word is what he is amen Hallelujah Glory now any person know that if God if God caught on this thing he wants to save a man that was lost and God saved that man by his faith the next man calls on God God will have to save that man if he comes to the same ground yes the first man came on and if there is a sick man and he pleads to God for Mercy that's it if God gives him mercy and healing on the basis of his faith the next man that comes on them shame grounds and asks the same question yes God's got to act the same way or he acted wrong when he acted the first time I know that because he tells us in the beginning God doesn't make mistakes God is infinite he will never make a mistake he will never do wrong and what he ever done for one he will do for another [Applause] and I began to uh look at that man I've never really looked at him before a little bit but of course Cornelius was his name and you know he was a gentile and one day though he began to seek God he always tried to honor God and everything that he did right and he one day he was fast in it and he was praying in his room and he was just seeking God and seeking God's will right and he began to have an angel come into his room and it began to tell him about a disciple named Peter and he said I want you to go to Peter and talk to Peter and you see God was working on both ends because Peter while he was waiting for supper to be ready he began to go up on the roof and it said well he sat there he went into a trance which we would know as a vision and that's right began to go in this Vision he began to see all these unclean beasts and and the vision spoke to him and said said Peter rise kill and eat and he said no no Lord I I can't do that because these are unclean beasts and begin to tell Peter don't call that unclean which I have made that's it and that's very same dream he begins to tell him there's men here looking for you and don't worry about what they say they're telling you the truth because I sent them that's right so Cornelius begins to go in the room and and you know Peter begins to say even in the scripture he begins to say it's not accustomed for us Jews to have you in our household that's right it's not custom for us to do this but I've seen a vision and you're allowed to come in and they begin to talk to him and Peter begins to ask Cornelius why did you come here and he begins to tell about he was fashioned and he was praying and the angel spoke to him and told him to be there in Peter's astonished that God would begin to work with this Gentile there that God would begin to to talk to this man Cornelius who wasn't in the Commonwealth of Israel that's right and it's even believed that that that Cornelius was one of the first Gentiles to ever be saved because he would begin to crowd he would crowd to God and say I want to be right I want to be saved amen amen then Peter opened his mouth and said of truth I perceive that God is no respecter of persons but in every nation he that feareth him and worketh righteousness and it is accepted with him amen hallelujah God spoke to Peter and told him don't call those things unclean amen which I have made clean that's right now listen Church what I want you to realize even though Cornelius wasn't on the same grounds as Peter and the fact that he wasn't a Jew he wasn't one of the chosen eleven but he came the same way that Peter came he came the same way saying Lord I Need Your Mercy Lord I Need Your Grace and Hallelujah because he came the same way that Peter came and God cannot change amen amen amen he got the same results that Peter got amen amen under obligation this one here might throw you off a little bit but if you catch the Revelation you'll understand it yes sir amen one time when Jesus before his crucifixion here comes a little woman with her daughter that is sick her daughter's sick and and he becomes she begins to come to Jesus and and she begins to to talk to Jesus and and begin to ask Jesus Lord he should be going to say thou son of David Hill my daughter and Jesus doesn't pay any attention right and even the disciples say Lord would you just cast her away she keeps bugging us she won't stop following us but but Jesus begins to speak to her and behold a woman of Canaan came out of the same coast and Cried unto him saying have mercy on me O Lord thou son of David my daughter is grievously vexed with the devil but he answered her not a word and his disciples came and beso him saying send her away for she crieth after us amen but he answered and said I am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the House of Israel amen now listen Church how beautiful this is it said but then she came and worshiped him saying Lord help me I'm Amendment but he answered and said it is not me to take the children's bread and cast it to dogs and she said truth Lord that's it yet the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from the master's table that's it now brother Branham says the real genuine faith will always admit the word of God is true no matter what the circumstance is amen she said it's the truth amen if you wasn't sent to us it's the truth amen I'm nothing but a dog I'm amen but let me give you my side of it amen for the blessings that thank God I'm looking for crumbs yes sir now what I want you to realize here go ahead now she must have been like Cornelius and seen something because she had to know she had to know that Jesus could fix her situation that's right that's not what she seen I don't know maybe she seen the leper healed I don't know maybe she seen maybe she's seen the captain come and say or the Centurion come and say my one of my workers is sick and maybe she heard a conversation and now he was healed and she knew this man had Authority maybe she heard the story of geriasis daughter that was brought back to life maybe she just got done because the chapter before that Jesus just got done feeding five thousand with a little bit of bread and a little bit of fish and even though Jesus has said it's not me for me to give you this she knows that he can do it amen amen amen and because even though the time of the Gentiles had yet not not yet come and it was the time for the Jews her faith began to rise up amen she began to say I know who this is God cannot help but honor Faith you know why because he's a God that cannot change [Applause] when Rahab the Gentiles his face yes my brother throughout that scared and she was saved by faith yesterday she did that for that Gentile he had to do it for this in time amen then Jesus answered and said to her o woman great is that Faith he loves faith preaching great is thy faith I mean it unto thee even as thy will and her daughter was made whole from that very hour because God cannot change amen you might not feel like you're much you might feel like a dog people might call you a dog but they're still crumbs for you [Applause] he wants to give you everything glory to God listen in the beginning was the word and the Word was spoken was a creative word and every word that's spoken cannot be taken back for a mistake then in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us which is Christ and now the word of God written in the Bible his word to us and every promise has the same power of creation behind it that's God's word it the same as the God's word did at the beginning if we believe it to be the word of God it depends on where the seed Falls if it falls into a ground a ground that can create a moisture or a nourishment around the promise of God they will bring forth every promise the Bible made why the right mental attitude towards any Divine promise of God will bring it to pass amen amen what he's saying here when you look at this word this is not just a story no sir this is not just a little fairy tale that you read at night before you go to bed no sense but this is the creative spoken words of God Amen if it falls in the right ground that's it if you will take it in your heart yes sir say this is mine yes believe it yes believe that yes at the same ground that I'm walking on the same ground that was created by the spoken word is the same word that is in this Bible and you take it into your heart it will have the same creative effect it reminds me of a story that that brother Branham told and he begins to tell the story of a of an old pirate and now he there was a there was a a kid that was kidnapped and he was taken on this boat this pirate ship and as he was taking on this boat he was always that young man was raised a Christian and his mother raised him in the right way to to believe the word of God but believe it it all costs and and you know he began to uh the captain the old pirate Captain began to get sick and he began to get sick and die and but while he was there there was something in his heart that began to cry out I can't die this way I I gotta get right with God so so he began to look yes I must start feeling good here in a minute I'm getting to my the part I want to get to go ahead he began to look around and he began to ask is there anyone here that has a solution is there anyone here that has a Bible that they can bring to me and and there was a little kid that boy on there and by the name of Willie Pruitt and he began to say I have a Bible and he said would you bring it to me and he said would you read me something out of that Bible and he turned to Isaiah 53-5 brother Brandon says it and he begins to say he was wounded for our transgression and he was bruised for our iniquity and the chastisement of our peace was upon him and and with his stripes we are healed and that that man began to say oh that says that sounds mighty fine would would you mind to keep reading for me but but he began to say well sir can I show you how my mama taught me how to read it that's it maybe he was sick as a young child maybe maybe he had a fever one time right then his mama began to turn to the creative word of God and they began to read it and she began to tell him Willy don't you let anybody take your name out of that scripture that's it and he began to tell him he was wounded for Willie Pruitt's transparency amen he was bruised for Willie Pruitt's iniquity of Willie Pruitt's pieces Willie Pruitt is [Applause] sure yes sir and John Core said you think you can put my name in there that's it because God is a God that cannot change because God is a bad man he said let's see if it'll work amen was wounded for John Court's chance instructions amen for this Lord Jesus John courts found what Willie Pruitt found amen he got that same Faith yes his name in the scripture yes my brother no matter what comes amen yes sir he met that Faith amen and it doesn't matter where they came from it didn't matter where they were I was a pirate kid now when they no matter what role yes my brother he's no respecter of persons can I say this he's a respecter of Faith a man he just wants somebody to rise up man he's around me might change family might change things might change Church might change but my God will not change oh friend if you can only read your name in there if I can read my name he was wounded for William branham's transgressions he was Bruce not the church not just a Creed he was bruised for my iniquity the chastising of my peace was upon him and with his stripes William Branham was healed oh if we can just read our name in the scripture and really mean it in what it does read our names into it make a receiving pardon when we realized that he was wounded for our transgression and he was bruised for ironic amen amen amen why Hallelujah listen that's great Hallelujah really Pruitt yes received it and because he received it John Court seen it and God honored Willie Pruitt so God ordered honored John course but listen he's the same yesterday today and forever so if he if he honored Willie Pruitt right if he honored John courts then he'll honor Seth coffee he'll honor you he'll honor anybody anyone any from any place any Direction no matter where you're from no matter what you're going through and honor it amen amen you say what are you talking about God loves it when people believe the same thing amen say what do you mean by that what brother Branham had a had a meeting one time that he tells over and over again I'm sure you know it but I want you to realize this brother Branham he's he's in Mexico and there's a blind man that comes up and he he says it reminds him of his dad and he was thinking about trying to give him his shoes he didn't have no shoes he began to have sincerity in his heart and he began to pray for him and the blind man was healed received his sight and there was a little woman in the audience and she seen that happen and the next morning her baby had died but you know what she realized I can do that for him keep moving God can do that for him if my God does not change he can do that for me now everybody in the church said it can't be done every Usher tried to stop her everybody tried to put her back preaching the prophet said just go pray for her but she had so much faith and God loves Faith oh my man that he stopped a prophet sermon right in the middle of it and gave him a vision and he said where's that baby give me that baby why amen pray because God cannot change and he said do you really Faith produce the vision God love that Faith soul television preach Bridge the Holy Spirit coming in like a whirlwind a vision opens up where's that baby and that baby that was medically proclaimed dead at nine o'clock that morning cold but the grave couldn't hold Lazarus and God don't change and that death couldn't hold on to that baby because the same Faith was met amen hallelujah I believe she met that same faith that Mary and Martha met when he said I am the resurrection they said we believe that ah man there was something in the inside of her that she began to cry he's the resurrection my baby my big dad but that's nothing for God [Music] she fell through the ushers she fought through the doubters she fought through the naysayers she fought through the medical team she fought through her own thoughts yes too she got to the prophet and the prophet took it in his arms and they began to pray Lord I'm not sure if this is that baby but Lord you gave me the vision about that time that baby started kicking and screaming Hallelujah [Applause] it brought the Life of Christ on display again same Miracle yeah that raised Lazarus from the dead that same Spirit quickened yes my brother yes sir preach my brother you know church I'm just going to say it the way I know how to say it we're living beneath our privileges I'll tell you the truth everything changes so much Satan uses that change to try to get us and battle our minds and say God just don't move like that's exactly right I just won't do what he used to that's a lie of the devil amen I must say it plain and clear if God don't change someone else must have changed if God don't change and we ain't seeing God move like we want to somebody must have changed that somebody's me I'm not gonna lay myself down I'm gonna put myself on that cross I'm going to crucify myself till Jesus Christ can live I may change he's the same yesterday today and forever [Music] ask and it shall be given to you seek and you shall find it knock and it shall be open amen Preacher Brother Branham says I can go on record for this tonight if any people will take the right mental attitude toward any Divine promise that God ever made and claim it for yours he will God will bring it to pass if you'll take the right attitude towards it can I say can I just just say this and I love you we can't have the attitude of God might do it God may do it that's not the same faith that was once delivered that's not the same fate that was once delivered our God is more than able amen that's a bad attitude amen knowing that if God said so the promise is yours and it's yours personal property the very minute you receive it that way then it has to come to pass for Jesus said the word is a seed that A sower sowed and a seed if it's a germatized seed and goes into the ground then that seed under the right conditions what is it Lord I believe I believe no matter what happens he said symptoms are the worst thing that a Believer can look to his symptoms symptoms ain't got nothing to do with it God I believe [Applause] that's the right motion will bring forth the life that's in the seed and so is the word of God if a person can take that word remember creative word and place it in their heart and give it the right sunshine the right temperature not s-u-n but s-o-n the right temperature of faith in there that seed and promise will live to you just like it did at the beginning the one it was given to because it's God's word and he is the same yesterday today and forever he cannot fail I'll tell you what church we need to kill some devils tonight we need to kill some demons tonight let's say God might can do no God has already done it ah amen kill some devils tonight let's say my family will never come back God said he will not lose a woman he's coming back no matter what that devil said Hallelujah and let me tell you something you're not alone the god of Glory is on your side and when you make that same faith brother Brandon said that Jailer that night he believed that his house would be saved and his house was saved amen amen because he came under that same faith [Applause] I don't know about you but I'm done with the devil I'm done with his lies I'm done with what he told me get me behind me Satan I'm sick of it I'm tired of it my God is a living God my God is the one true God my God changes not [Applause] my God is a Mountain Mover my God is a situation changer my God it's the Healer the Supreme [Applause] that's my God Amen I don't know about you but I'm not going to serve the God of this evil age but I'm serving the one true Living God I can go free that's that I can add victory I believe that amen If He Did It for the disciples he'll do it for me [Music] you say I want the Holy Ghost read to my brother the Holy Ghost for the promise is unto you and to your children and to all that are afar off even as many as our Lord Our God shall come is God still given the Holy Ghost absolutely if you make that same faith that on the day of Pentecost they begin to walk out and preach the gospel and I believe it was three thousand Souls we're saved in one day why because they believe what the 120 in the upper room believed and God honored that faith God couldn't give the 120 the Holy Ghost without giving the three thousand the Holy Ghost [Applause] because he honors that faith and he cannot change he will not change if you want the Holy Ghost I'll tell you this want it want it more than your next meal you can't say that'd be pretty cool to have or that'd be a nice thing to have with me hey overcoming power that's great you got to be life and death sincere but if you make that faith the Holy Ghost is yours and people always going well I want a refilling of the Holy Ghost and I'm just going to say this if it takes a dime out to self to get the Holy Ghost and you've got to want it more than anything I say if you want a refill it you gotta want it more than anything amen you gotta lay down everything that ain't like you you gotta let it go you gotta forgive that brother and sister that did you wrong if you want the life of Jesus you gotta act like Jesus In the Flesh to forgive you've got to forgive you gotta let go when everything in your body says hold on you God do what he did when he was hanging on the cross he said father man forgive ah man but if you make that face it's a guarantee I am the Lord I change not can I just say this preaching my brother when you when you get the true revelation of the Bible whatever God said to them he just said it to you when you can put your name in there when the Bible becomes a new book to you when you can read it he was wounded for Seth coffee [Music] if Seth coffee ask anything in my name I'll do it [Music] when you can put your name in there [Applause] amen he told Jeremiah one time he said Jeremiah you shall call upon me and ye shall grow and pray unto me and I will hearken unto you and ye shall seek me and find me when ye shall search for me with all your heart now listen I'm gonna tell you Jeremiah did that and if Jeremiah did that man and if I do the same thing if I get to a place where I'm wondering where God is in my life and I know Jeremiah might have had that same thought one day where is God at in Israel and God spoke to him and said Jeremiah when you seek for me with all your heart amen and you lay everything else aside I'll be there and Jeremiah did it and found him if I come and I read that scripture and he said then Seth if ye shall seek me with all your heart you'll find me that's a promise because God cannot tell Jeremiah that and God cannot do that for Jeremiah unless he'll do it for you amen if he would do that for a gentile before it was ever the dispensation of the Gentiles how much more will he do it for the bride [Music] ah man I'm gonna tell you what every woman in the world could ask me to buy them something there's a good chance I ain't gonna buy it for him but if my wife comes to me and says Seth I need this I'm going to find a way to get it for her and we just ain't somebody we just ain't a nobody but we're the Bride of Jesus ask Ed knock shake it yes it'll be given yes if he did it for Jeremiah he'll do it for me I'm gonna preach now if say I'm God in his lowest point in life [Music] get up one day and grab an old Ox goat and say that's enough I'll tell you what I can too I can't time even if at my lowest point [Applause] I can look to the hills where my hell comes from I can find the Strong Tower that the righteous run into and are saved [Applause] [Music] if Samson when the devil thought he had him whooped if he could just reach back and say I still believe I still believe amen when I killed a thousand of them Hallelujah with a Jawbone and I believe you're still that same God I might have made mistakes I might have done things wrong but that's what I'm coming back to the Heart of Worship where it's all about you and it ain't about me yet he grab those pillars and he began to pull it down please died to himself but when he died to himself he killed more for less things than he ever killed his life let me tell you preach my brother a dog it's dangerous when it's wounded it's the most dangerous one that's wounded Samson might have been wounded but he was still a dog in the fight he was still a son of God I'm gonna tell you right now if David could kill his Goliath and he was a Seed of Abraham you can kill your Goliath if you've lost the joy of your salvation and you come to God saying I want the joy of my salvation back he's God and he changes not I'm happy if he gave David that Joy he'll give us that Joy Amen brother saith I'm so wrapped up in so much self well if Joshua could proclaim the victory before one stone ever fell down I guess I'll just go ahead and proclaim the victory over my family over my friends amen amen Oh Brother Sam prayer family so caught up with addiction and they don't believe the message like they used to and everything I'll Proclaim that Jericho is already on the ground and Ashes even if I don't see one stone fire because he said as I was with Moses so will I be with you Joshua and if he told Joshua he would be with him and he said I'll never leave you nor forsake you if he'll do that for Joshua he'll he has to do that for me amen amen preaching my brother Hallelujah glory to God glory to God preach my brother I don't know if you know it or not but there's some there's some people going free tonight [Applause] oh yeah oh yeah I know there's some people going freedom you see them jump up and start praising God you know why they're going free because one time Paul and Silas were in a jail [Applause] and God was so delighted and God seen such faith and God smelled the incense of Praise began to rise up you know what when you're in here and you begin to praise God no matter the circumstance no matter the change no matter the prison God Honors that faith and let me tell you if God tore down that prison for Paul he has to tear down that prison for you amen he promised he's a god of his word his word cannot fail he said he will inhabit the Praises of his people I say we better Praise Him not just in the good times in the bad times when everything's going wrong he's still worth it you know why you do that right now in the name of Jesus Christ and I promise you those things add you bail those things that wouldn't let go will start falling off of you he's obligated to do it he promised that he would [Music] glory to God preach whatever you want go get it preach it preach where are you at Gideon where are you at you mighty man of Valor where are you at Hannah wait where are you at when you pray all night Hannah where is that woman with a blood issue that no matter what I'll press through preach my brother by the power of the Holy Ghost I say he'll do it again big touch and that blood issue dried up and he's still the high priest that can be touched by the field of our infirmities [Applause] we can touch him we can be set free if Hannah could pray so hard that she began to have stammering lips [Applause] that the priest would even think she was drunk but she got that child and God didn't just give her a child he gave her a prophet amen Our God don't do nothing halfway and our God will not change amen let me tell you this preaching the situation might look bad the world might be changed and things might be going bad but listen with the worst time in the earth before this time it was a time of Noah's flood and let me tell you there was a man there by the name of Enoch and he walked so close with God he began to walk so close with him he didn't care what the naysayer said he didn't care what the doubter said he didn't care what everybody trying to prove something wrong said he was walking so close to God that he began to walk so close to God brother Branham said a man can walk so close to God that the devil don't know what to do with him and I say if Enoch walks so close to God that his body couldn't help but be taken away if he can do that and God did that for him and God will not change and God honored that brother Stephen we're going to walk so close to God that one day we're just going to walk right on [Music] Enoch he'll do it for you amen Hallelujah pray to my brother I'm trying to come to a close but let me tell you whatever he did he's still doing today [Applause] if the disciples laid hands on the sick and they recover he's still doing it today if they cast out evil spirit if they went by the gate called beautiful and said Silver and Gold Have I known but that which I have I give to you freely I'm here to give to you freely tonight of this Holy Ghost Gospel that changes lives Hallelujah there's no stronghold that can stop it church I've seen it I have seen it this is the truth this is the truth that sets men free I've never been so free in my life this is freedom [Music] I don't have to be bound by pornography I don't have to be bound by drugs I don't have to be bound by smoking I don't have to be bound by any of that because I'm free amen church I've seen it I've seen arthritis that people had dealt with for years pray for them it's gone why he did it for Peter James and John and Paul he has to do it for us if we meet that same Faith he'll do it multiple multiple hurt backs people couldn't even walk hardly get out of bed come up for prayer and God completely deliver them you're looking at one right here [Applause] [Music] amen I've seen people in the hospital they said no hope because lay it on a brother or sister's heart to go up and have prayer and they come out of that hospital and the doctors not understand I've seen my own Uncle Leon van in the ICU with coven getting worse and worse but a prayer cloth got through [Music] you know why because Paul used prayer cloths and if it worked for Paul it'll work for us [Applause] Glory I am the Lord can I change musicians come Hallelujah amen there ain't nothing too hard for our God I'm sick and tired of that devil running the bride down battle them every day saying it can't be it is it just depends if you want it or not [Applause] what can I ask you tonight what do you want do you want Revival do you want God to move in your life do you want to be delivered then you can be but you gotta want it you gotta want it more than anything but if you seek him with all your heart you'll find it he said I am God and I changed I've seen Isaiah 53 5. come into manifestation so many times I've seen my little girl brother Stephen in the middle of the night have a bump raise up on her leg I put her name in that scripture and when I got done she went to sleep and that bump was gone where'd it go back to the pits of hell John quartz John quartz was healed if Willie Pruitt was healed my daughter had to be healed too church can I say this this is what the message is back to the original whatever he did he still does he still delivers he still sets free he's still the god of restoration [Applause] if he ever feel but the Holy Ghost he still does if he ever healed he still heals glory to God this is Who We Are we are not just a nobody but we are his I don't know about you but I have seen him do too much to doubt him now Heavenly Father Lord Jesus we thank you for this

every single thing that we're going through Lord it's not just a thing Lord that you're obligated to do father even though you said that you were but Lord you test much deeper than that father Lord you told us father Lord I heard your Prophet say Lord when our faith would even fail your faith will never fail oh God I I read in the scripture where you said cast all your cares on me for I care for you oh God Lord you're the god that when we can't even help ourselves you're there to help us Lord you're the god that every morning your mercies are new to get us through the day you're the god that we can ask anything in your name and you'll do it you're the god that will never let a word return unto you void Lord I pray that the seeds were planted in the right ground tonight Church listen what you got tonight when your faith was energized by the word of God faith cometh by hearing and hearing of the word of God and when your faith was energized and you planted that seed for whatever you needed you keep it in the right atmosphere brother Branham said God always answers prayer he might not answer it the way you expect it but God might work in an unexpected way but he will never not answer your prayer you keep it in that ground you nourish it you give it the word you sing praises over and that life that is in that sea will begin to come forth and come up in bloom and it'll set you free and set your family free sis in whatever that you need Heavenly Father we thank you for this night Lord I'm sorry if I held your people too long Lord forgive me but Lord I love them Lord and
