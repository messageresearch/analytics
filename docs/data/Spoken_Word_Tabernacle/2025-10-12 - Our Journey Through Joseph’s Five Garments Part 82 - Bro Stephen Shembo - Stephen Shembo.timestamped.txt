[0:00] baby. There's nothing like it. Only
[0:02] God's love. A mother may forget her
[0:05] sucking babe, but never can I forget
[0:07] you. Your names are engraved on the
[0:10] palms of my hands.
[0:12] &gt;&gt; How can he forget you? I'll never
[0:16] forsake thee or never leave thee. I'll
[0:20] be with thee always, even to the end of
[0:23] the world.
[0:25] There she looks at her baby. Maybe she
[0:28] slipped back and kissed his little
[0:29] forehead. Whether she fainted and died
[0:32] on the outside,
[0:34] she goes out. It's just beginning to
[0:36] kind of sun begin to rise over the
[0:39] Judeian hills. And she looks at the sun
[0:42] begin to peep up way down the street.
[0:44] She hears cursing in going on. And she
[0:47] goes out in the yard and noticed she
[0:50] picked up two sticks.
[0:53] Not an arm load. Two sticks. What is it?
[0:56] the cross.
[0:59] Now, anyone knows, any of my Indian
[1:02] friends sure know or any hunter, the
[1:05] correct way of making a fire to last is
[1:08] cross two sticks, two logs, light it
[1:10] right in the middle, just keep pushing
[1:12] the ends in. It'll last all night. Many
[1:16] time have I laid in the wilderness with
[1:17] two sticks, no bigger than that, and
[1:19] keep warm all night. Just enough to keep
[1:21] warm. Keep it going. Right in the center
[1:24] of it. Now what's she going to do like
[1:26] these two sticks and the word and the
[1:31] spirit is brought to self-sacrifice on
[1:35] the cross ready for duty ready for life
[1:39] putting the word and the spirit that's
[1:43] her faith in the word of God by the Holy
[1:46] Ghost leading herself to sacrifice
[1:49] anything else to the cross.
[1:53] And when she got the stick under her
[1:54] arm, two of them, and started back, she
[1:57] started back. And there was a voice came
[1:59] from the gate.
[2:02] Lady, just before that, an old maybe
[2:06] baldheaded and gray hanging over his
[2:09] whiskers and his hair hanging down, a
[2:11] little stick in his hand, an old sheep
[2:13] skin or something wrapped around him,
[2:15] walking down the street saying, "Lord,
[2:17] it's a certain little white fence.
[2:19] There'll be a lovely looking young
[2:21] woman. She must have been young. The boy
[2:23] was young out in the yard. You told me
[2:26] that was the widow that was to feed me.
[2:29] Now, where is she at? I'll keep walking.
[2:31] The spirit leads him this way, then
[2:33] turns him. Oh, it's so wonderful. Sons
[2:36] of God are led by the spirit of God. No
[2:39] matter how silly it sounds,
[2:42] &gt;&gt; they are led.
[2:43] &gt;&gt; She go he goes down one street and up
[2:45] another. Down one street and up another.
[2:48] After a while, the spirit said, "Look to
[2:49] your right." And he looks sitting around
[2:52] like that just like he does here at the
[2:53] platform night after night.
[2:57] &gt;&gt; Oh, God's still the same.
[3:02] &gt;&gt; Look to your right, to your left.
[3:04] There's someone praying who needs it.
[3:07] And he looked to his right and say,
[3:09] "There's a little white fence. That's
[3:11] just right. I just won't move from here
[3:14] because there's the old tree standing
[3:16] there. There's everything just the way I
[3:18] saw in the vision. The door opens. A
[3:20] little thin woman comes out. Now
[3:22] remember, she's just going to pick up
[3:23] two sticks. She couldn't have picked up
[3:25] three. Takes two to make the cross. She
[3:29] picked up two sticks and put her on her
[3:30] arm. And she started back thinking I'll
[3:32] have the little cake done when Sunny
[3:34] wakes up. And then I'll feed it to him.
[3:37] I won't eat any myself and I'll put my
[3:38] little boy in my arms and there will sit
[3:40] and die. And she started into the house.
[3:43] She heard a strange voice across the
[3:45] gate said,"Woman,
[3:48] would you fetch me a little drink of
[3:51] water
[3:53] in a vessel?"
[3:55] And she turned and she thought, "There
[3:58] stands a kind old man at the gate."
[4:02] She looked at him real close and maybe
[4:04] wiped the tears from her eyes. It was
[4:05] quite early yet, you know, God does so
[4:08] strange.
[4:11] She was willing to sacrifice. Water was
[4:13] a scarce rain for three years.

[26:17] question and answer, um, you know, as
[26:20] she's there, um, she asked me for a
[26:22] piece of paper and, you know, while
[26:24] we're doing what we do, she just wrote
[26:27] these things and so she she read it to
[26:30] us in the car and I mean, it just
[26:31] blessed our heart, you know, that it
[26:33] said, as it said, suffer the little
[26:34] children to come unto me and there's the
[26:36] kingdom of heaven. So, you know, when
[26:38] you bring them around the word, that's
[26:40] the result that you'll see. And she's
[26:42] going to read that now, right? Okay. Go
[26:44] ahead. And this was just her heart to
[26:46] the Lord.
[26:48] &gt;&gt; Go ahead.

[27:53] &gt;&gt; And the Lord will surely take possession
[27:56] of this young lady. Amen.
[27:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. We invite Sister Lily who has a
[28:00] shot short testimony. Amen.
[28:04] Okay. No problem.
[28:06] No problem.
[28:12] Um, I had to write it down or else I
[28:15] will babble a lot. So, I'll try to read
[28:17] it quickly to save time.
[28:20] Um, as you all know, I had a DNC surgery
[28:23] in April to remove a molar pregnancy and
[28:26] I have been in a six-monthlong recovery
[28:29] with my women's health doctor um which
[28:32] will be until this upcoming December.
[28:35] Um, a few weeks after the surgery, I
[28:36] started receiving the medical bills.
[28:39] There was some from everybody from the
[28:41] anesthesiologist, the proctologologist,
[28:43] my OB/GYN, LabCore, from the continuous
[28:46] monthly labs um that I'm still doing.
[28:48] But the biggest one was the biggest
[28:51] source of stress for us, which was the
[28:52] hospital bill um for almost $8,000.
[28:56] That was actually a discounted balance
[28:58] from the original 13,000.
[29:00] Um, obviously we did not have that much
[29:03] money to just hand to the hospital. Um,
[29:05] the day after my surgery, Zach had just
[29:08] started his class at his hit his new job
[29:11] and then a month after the surgery, like
[29:13] literally like three and a half weeks
[29:14] after the surgery, we moved and our rent
[29:17] doubled as well. So, that was our
[29:19] priority financially. Um, once I
[29:22] received the majority of the bills, I
[29:23] submitted them to my member sharing
[29:25] insurance and I started an application
[29:27] with Medicaid. Um, DSS, oh, sorry, my
[29:30] phone is glitching. Um, DSS basically
[29:33] told me what paperwork they needed from
[29:34] me. And it took me about a week to
[29:36] gather all of that information, you
[29:37] know, pay stubs from both of us, um,
[29:40] anything possibly that I could get a
[29:42] hold of. And I gathered all of it, took
[29:45] it in a folder that was labeled,
[29:47] organized, stapled in person. Um, at the
[29:51] end of July, I got a letter in the mail
[29:53] that Medicaid denied any sort of
[29:54] coverage at all or any type of help with
[29:57] those bills.
[29:58] Um, I gave them everything they'd asked
[30:00] for. So, I called the case worker and
[30:02] asked what I had failed to submit. And
[30:04] she claimed that their records showed
[30:06] that the only documents that they had
[30:08] were my social security card and
[30:09] insurance card, which was what I dropped
[30:11] off my first visit when I started the
[30:12] application. I told her, "No, ma'am.
[30:15] That is not correct." I told her the
[30:17] exact day and time that I went to the
[30:19] office in person and handed it, told
[30:21] them, "Check the cameras." and that I
[30:24] brought a big labeled um folder with
[30:27] every single document. She said she
[30:28] would investigate and call me back in a
[30:30] few days to let me know what she finds.
[30:32] She called me at work the following week
[30:34] and I was already struggling that day.
[30:35] It was a Wednesday. Um I had already
[30:38] been sick for three weeks. I was
[30:40] coughing my head off so bad that it was
[30:42] actually making me vomit and I could
[30:44] hardly talk because I was losing my
[30:45] voice. Um she she called and confirmed
[30:48] that all they had were those two cards.
[30:50] So, they lost all the paperwork I gave
[30:52] them. And by this point, it had already
[30:54] been two months since I originally
[30:57] started the application. She uh I got
[31:00] really upset. I told her that the front
[31:02] desk, sent me to the second floor. I
[31:04] told her every detail I remembered,
[31:05] handed them I handed my documents to a
[31:07] little elderly white lady with short
[31:09] white hair and glasses, and even spoke
[31:11] to the case worker herself on the phone
[31:13] in one of their offices that day.
[31:15] She told me that they would never have
[31:17] sent me to the second floor because they
[31:19] don't process files up there. And she
[31:21] was basically talking to me like I'd
[31:23] hallucinated even doing it that day. She
[31:25] told me the best I can do is reapply and
[31:27] that I will not likely get coverage
[31:29] because it was now August and my surgery
[31:30] was in April. Um I told her
[31:34] well I told her I'm not going to reapply
[31:36] because you're just going to lose it
[31:38] again if I can't handle hand it to you
[31:39] directly.
[31:41] That day I went home and I called Zach
[31:43] and I was crying. I mean, I was really
[31:45] stressed out. I was starting to get
[31:46] colle like threatening to get sent to
[31:49] collections and I' I've never dealt with
[31:50] this before. So, it's my first surgery,
[31:53] my first big medical expense. And Zach
[31:56] told me, "You need to go to the prayer
[31:57] closet when you get home from work, and
[31:58] you just need to pray." So, I went home,
[32:01] I went my prayer closet, and I just
[32:03] started crying out to the Lord. And I
[32:04] had prayed before this that Medicaid
[32:06] would cover all of my bills. So,
[32:08] obviously, I was pretty disappointed.
[32:11] And uh my insurance was also not looking
[32:13] like it was going to cover anything as
[32:14] well. Um
[32:17] at this point, the temptation was pretty
[32:19] real to start freaking out and
[32:21] panicking, but I just told the Lord that
[32:24] I didn't choose for this to happen to
[32:25] me. And it's like Sister Georgia said
[32:28] yesterday, she didn't choose, she would
[32:30] never have chosen the path that the Lord
[32:32] God brought her through to get to this
[32:34] point. I told the Lord I would have
[32:36] never chosen to have three miscarriages
[32:38] or never chosen to get pregnant with a
[32:40] tumor. and as the doctor called it was a
[32:42] very rare random chance and have to have
[32:45] surgery to remove it. For each pregnancy
[32:47] I was preparing for a baby that I had
[32:49] prayed for and already loved. I didn't
[32:51] ask for it, but he saw it fit for me to
[32:54] go through every single one for a
[32:55] reason. And I just had faith that he
[32:57] would not put me through that and then
[32:59] leave me in the midst of it with all
[33:00] these medical bills that I didn't have
[33:02] the money to pay. I did my part and I
[33:05] didn't know how he would do it or when,
[33:06] but I just knew he was going to wipe the
[33:08] debt completely clean.
[33:10] and I told him I would testify when it
[33:12] happened. That same night, we had
[33:14] Wednesday night service and brother Seth
[33:16] preached that God not only cares about
[33:17] your salvation, but he also cares about
[33:19] your health and your finances.
[33:23] The hospital started sending me texts
[33:25] threatening to send me to collections.
[33:26] So, I decided to give them a call and
[33:28] tell them they could put me in jail and
[33:29] I still still wouldn't have the money to
[33:31] pay for to pay for it. Uh, as soon as I
[33:35] mentioned the text regarding that they
[33:37] sent me that they would send me to
[33:39] collections, a lady cut me off and told
[33:40] me that she would be happy to send me an
[33:42] application for finan financial
[33:44] assistance to fill out. By this point,
[33:46] um, when I called, I believe this was
[33:48] like a week earlier, and uh, Medicaid
[33:50] hadn't denied me yet. As a a few weeks
[33:53] went by, I got the application in the
[33:55] mail, I filled it out, and I even put on
[33:56] there at this point that Medicaid had
[33:58] denied me coverage. So, that was about a
[34:01] month ago. Um, over the last few weeks,
[34:04] the devil has attacked Zach and I at
[34:06] every angle, especially once our prayer
[34:08] meeting started within the last two
[34:09] weeks. The morning of this last Tuesday
[34:13] prayer meeting, I read my scripture for
[34:15] that morning, which was in 2 Kings 3 and
[34:17] 4, where Elisha had told the kings that
[34:19] ran out of water to dig ditches in the
[34:21] wilderness and that the Lord would
[34:22] provide the water and make wells for not
[34:24] only them to drink from, but for their
[34:26] cows and all their animals. I read in
[34:28] the next chapter of the widow with just
[34:30] one single pot of oil that obeyed the
[34:32] prophet when he told her to gather as
[34:34] many jars as she could to fill with oil
[34:36] from one single pot and it only stopped
[34:38] when she ran out of jars. And not only
[34:40] was she able to pay her debt that she
[34:42] owed, but she was able to provide for
[34:43] her and her family even after that.
[34:45] Remember that because that resonated
[34:47] with me this boosted my faith. And when
[34:50] brother Steven was praying that night in
[34:52] the Zoom, he started praying for people
[34:53] with financial struggles and mentioned
[34:56] the woman with the jar of oil and the
[34:59] debt.
[35:01] I wasn't even praying for our debt that
[35:02] night. But yesterday, I received a
[35:05] letter from the hospital that not only
[35:06] did I get approved for financial
[35:08] assistance, and not only did I get
[35:10] approved for 100% of my $8,000 balance,
[35:14] but it doesn't expire until next
[35:16] September.
[35:17] If I have to go to the hospital for any
[35:19] other issues between now and next
[35:21] September, it will be 100% covered by
[35:23] this financial assistance.
[35:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:27] &gt;&gt; Glory. Glory.
[35:36] Oh, if
[35:38] if you keep reading if you keep reading
[35:41] in second Kings chapter 4, Elisha told
[35:44] the Shounomite woman that had no
[35:45] children that at a certain season
[35:47] according to the time of life, she would
[35:50] embrace his son.
[35:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[35:52] &gt;&gt; She didn't believe him and it still
[35:54] happened.
[35:56] &gt;&gt; So, I believe it. He answered our
[35:58] prayers about multiple depths, debts
[36:00] that he completely wiped clean multiple
[36:02] times. He answered our prayers about
[36:04] Zach getting a job that he loved with
[36:06] more opportunity. He answered our
[36:08] prayers about where to move after we got
[36:10] married. And he answered so many other
[36:12] prayers. And I believe that he'll answer
[36:13] this one as well.
[36:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[36:19] Amen. And amen. Amen. Amen.
[36:22] Our God is living and real. Amen.
[36:30] You want to say one thing?
[36:32] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[36:35] &gt;&gt; Hey, how you guys doing? Uh, I just want
[36:38] to thank God for being with me. Uh, I
[36:41] went to a party um about a month ago and
[36:45] they just was shooting out and I got
[36:47] shot in the hand right here. But I just
[36:49] want to thank God because the bullet
[36:51] didn't go through or I still got all my
[36:54] fingers and uh it was a Glock 45. So it
[36:58] was just I just want to thank God.
[37:03] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Amen. And amen. Amen.
[37:06] Amen. Brother Greg, can you just come
[37:10] up? Amen. And share with us your Oh,
[37:13] sister Charlene, can you make it quick?
[37:19] Amen. Her uncle is home from the
[37:22] hospital. Amen. Amen. Prayer works.
[37:25] Amen.
[37:30] &gt;&gt; Lord bless you all. Lord, we don't know
[37:33] what we all go through.
[37:38] And u
[37:40] quite a testimony.
[37:42] &gt;&gt; And you're going to hold that baby.
[37:45] [Music]
[37:45] [Applause]
[37:55] Well, my testimony, how many believe
[37:57] that God has a sense of humor?
[38:03] &gt;&gt; Brother Michael, it's good to see you
[38:04] back.
[38:06] Um,
[38:09] the other day, I think it was Thursday
[38:11] or Friday, my wife asked me, she says,
[38:13] "Are you going to the Q&A Saturday?"
[38:17] I said, "Well,
[38:20] that's a three-hour round trip, and I
[38:24] just don't feel like driving that." And
[38:27] then turn around and have to drive back
[38:28] down there Sunday. I'm thinking that's a
[38:31] lot of driving, and I just didn't feel
[38:33] like doing it.
[38:36] So, uh, obviously I didn't come,
[38:41] but the Lord taught me a valuable
[38:43] lesson.
[38:44] Um,
[38:46] Friday
[38:48] afternoon, I was out in my shed. I was,
[38:50] uh, refinishing,
[38:53] um, our, um, vanity from our bathroom,
[38:57] and I had brother Chad on from uh, this
[39:00] past Sunday.
[39:03] and uh he starts talking about this
[39:06] fellow that goes to church there. He
[39:09] lived in Columbus, Ohio, and it was a
[39:11] 2-hour drive from Columbus to Lima where
[39:14] brother Chad's church is at. And he was
[39:17] driving back and forth on Sundays.
[39:21] Well,
[39:22] he uh he ended up moving halfway,
[39:27] but then he he thought that wasn't good
[39:29] enough. So, he ended up moving to Lima
[39:33] because he wanted to fellowship with the
[39:35] brothers and sisters. He said, "I can
[39:37] drive to work." So, he he started
[39:40] driving to work every day, two hours.
[39:43] So, it's four hours round trip just so
[39:45] he could have fellowship and be at the
[39:47] church on Sundays and Wednesdays. And
[39:50] when I heard that, I said, "Okay, Lord,
[39:52] I know you're telling me to go
[39:54] tomorrow."
[39:57] [Applause]
[40:01] &gt;&gt; So, and I'm thinking, "Oh, man. I don't
[40:03] want to make that drive. I don't want to
[40:06] do it, but Lord, I know you're telling
[40:09] me to go."
[40:12] Well, I didn't go.
[40:15] And I've had my my other truck. I had
[40:18] the trailer hooked up to it and I had a
[40:20] bunch of brush on there from some trees
[40:23] that I trimmed and it's been sitting
[40:26] there for over a week and I keep saying,
[40:28] "Well, I'm going to do it tomorrow. Do
[40:29] it tomorrow." Well, I never did. Well, I
[40:31] did it yesterday
[40:34] and
[40:35] got to the landfill
[40:38] uh and I was doing some things. cut the
[40:42] truck off, was going to hook up to pull
[40:44] it off, the brush off, and I got back in
[40:47] to start the truck. It wouldn't start at
[40:49] all.
[40:51] And uh so um
[40:55] I get out, I'm look I'm look at the
[40:56] battery. The one of the post is all
[40:59] corroded because I don't drive the truck
[41:01] that much.
[41:03] And um so I call my wife. I says, "Uh
[41:08] can you come get me?" Uh, you know, and
[41:10] then but then somebody else showed up
[41:13] there at the landfill and he had a
[41:15] jumper box.
[41:17] So, we tried that. Didn't do a thing. He
[41:19] had jumper cables. We tried that. Didn't
[41:22] do a thing. So, I called my wife back. I
[41:24] said, "Come on, get me. I'm going to
[41:26] take this battery out. Go get a new
[41:28] battery." Because that battery been in
[41:29] there for quite a while.
[41:31] So, I took the battery out. We go to
[41:34] town, which is about six, seven miles
[41:36] away. get the battery, come back, put it
[41:39] in, and the terminal broke.
[41:43] And so, great. So, we had to go back
[41:47] into town
[41:49] and get that. I come back, put all that
[41:53] on,
[41:54] still wouldn't start. Wouldn't even do
[41:57] nothing.
[41:58] And uh I told my wife, I says,
[42:02] "Yeah, the Lord has a sense of humor. Uh
[42:06] now my truck is sitting at the landfill
[42:08] until tomorrow.
[42:10] And uh so I told her I says um just like
[42:15] uh several years ago when my trailer was
[42:18] stolen, I was going to work on a
[42:20] Wednesday and it was stolen and said
[42:22] never again am I going to work on
[42:24] Wednesday. So that being said,
[42:28] never again
[42:30] am I going to miss Q&A.
[42:37] Amen.
[42:39] Never again
[42:41] is it going to miss Q&A and never again
[42:45] are we going to miss our blessings.
[42:47] Amen.
[42:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. Um we want to invite brother
[42:51] Michael. Amen. And we thank the Lord for
[42:56] traveling mercies bringing him and his
[42:58] wife back safely. We just invite him to
[43:01] come and thank the Lord for the lives of
[43:04] our brethren and also bring before the
[43:06] Lord our prayer request and then the
[43:09] tithes and offerings. Amen. Then after
[43:11] that we have our specials. Amen.
[43:17] God bless you all.
[43:20] &gt;&gt; It's good to be back. Stand up. Let's
[43:22] Let's stand up. It's good to be back
[43:24] among
[43:25] the children of God. I want to thank God
[43:28] for the traveling masses we had when we
[43:31] went to Nairobi, Kenya and back. We came
[43:33] back on on Friday still fighting jet
[43:37] lag.
[43:39] Um it was very nice to have question and
[43:42] answers. Brother Greg,
[43:48] somebody asked a question one year ago
[43:50] and it was about heaven. Where is
[43:53] heaven? But God being gracious enough,
[43:56] heaven came down yesterday.
[43:59] &gt;&gt; Yes. He God came down and showed us that
[44:03] heaven is right here with us. Yeah.
[44:07] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[44:08] It was one of the most blessed question
[44:11] and answers I've ever heard in my life.
[44:15] And I want to thank God for the ministry
[44:18] that can yield to God so that we can
[44:21] have such nuggets.
[44:23] I went to bed very very happy person.

[1:12:44] &gt;&gt; But this is a different type of
[1:12:45] dressing.
[1:12:47] &gt;&gt; This is not a dressing a casual dress
[1:12:49] for home.
[1:12:52] &gt;&gt; This is a dressing to go
[1:12:54] &gt;&gt; to leave.
[1:12:58] &gt;&gt; You didn't dress to stay home.
[1:13:00] &gt;&gt; You didn't dress so when you finish you
[1:13:02] go to bed. You didn't dress to go to
[1:13:05] work.
[1:13:05] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:13:06] &gt;&gt; You didn't dress to go to church and
[1:13:08] come back to work.
[1:13:09] &gt;&gt; This type of dressing is a is a dressing
[1:13:12] to leave the country.
[1:13:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:16] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:13:18] &gt;&gt; Is my Bible different than yours.
[1:13:19] &gt;&gt; So the Bible say when you eat it, oh let
[1:13:22] me give you answer. My theme this
[1:13:25] morning
[1:13:27] somebody was looking at my t this
[1:13:30] morning first is our life journey
[1:13:32] through Joseph 5 garment part 82
[1:13:36] and my theme is season
[1:13:41] because we're still dealing with it
[1:13:43] seasons on the other side of darkness.
[1:13:53] Amen.
[1:13:55] &gt;&gt; On the other side of darkness.
[1:14:00] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:14:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:05] &gt;&gt; Okay, now let's go. He says, "And that
[1:14:07] shall you eat it with your loins how it
[1:14:12] &gt;&gt; your shoes on your feet
[1:14:16] &gt;&gt; and your stuff in your hand.
[1:14:19] &gt;&gt; And you shall eat it how?
[1:14:21] &gt;&gt; In haste.
[1:14:22] &gt;&gt; It is the Lord's what?
[1:14:23] &gt;&gt; Passover."
[1:14:24] &gt;&gt; In other words, when you eat this
[1:14:26] Passover, you must be ready.
[1:14:28] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:14:28] &gt;&gt; That's what it means.
[1:14:30] &gt;&gt; God is saying you must be ready.
[1:14:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:34] &gt;&gt; Ready to go.
[1:14:36] ready for departure.
[1:14:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:40] &gt;&gt; So when the airplane come,
[1:14:43] &gt;&gt; you don't need to go get your luggage or
[1:14:45] prepare for the luggage or go pick up.
[1:14:48] No, no, no. Everybody, everything should
[1:14:50] be there.
[1:14:51] &gt;&gt; So when the Uber, the Uber, stop right
[1:14:54] there. They open the door, you just get
[1:14:56] in the car and that's it. We clear so
[1:14:58] far?
[1:14:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:59] &gt;&gt; We clear?
[1:15:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:01] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Verse 12. for I will pass
[1:15:04] through the land of Egypt this night.
[1:15:09] In another place he says about midnight,
[1:15:14] but we didn't know when really it was.
[1:15:18] Here it's more vague this night. Is he
[1:15:21] going to be at 900 p.m. 8:00 p.m. or
[1:15:24] what? We don't know. So the the the the
[1:15:28] actual specific time is not known,
[1:15:31] &gt;&gt; right? We can just get a range of it.
[1:15:34] &gt;&gt; We clear so far.
[1:15:36] &gt;&gt; Are we clear?
[1:15:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:37] &gt;&gt; This is the first Exodus. We are on the
[1:15:39] third one. He say, "I will pass through
[1:15:41] the land of Egypt this night." Come on.
[1:15:44] And will smite all the firstborn of the
[1:15:47] land of Egypt, both men and beasts, and
[1:15:50] against all the gods of Egypt, I will
[1:15:53] execute judgment. I am the Lord. You
[1:15:56] remember this for last Sunday.
[1:15:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. jump on verse uh 29.
[1:16:03] Glory to God. If you there, you can say
[1:16:07] amen.
[1:16:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:08] &gt;&gt; Verse 29, the Bible says that it came to
[1:16:11] pass that at midnight. Now, the time has
[1:16:14] come.
[1:16:15] &gt;&gt; Midnight there is no sun there. So,
[1:16:17] we're in the midst of darkness.
[1:16:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:21] &gt;&gt; At midnight,
[1:16:23] you know the midnight cry, right?
[1:16:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. We're in the midst of darkness.
[1:16:30] Spooky
[1:16:33] &gt;&gt; because the spirit of death, the angel
[1:16:36] of death is on the land.
[1:16:40] &gt;&gt; Killing everywhere.
[1:16:42] &gt;&gt; Everybody's shouting, screaming.
[1:16:45] Are we together?
[1:16:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:47] &gt;&gt; Verse 29. And it came to pass that at
[1:16:49] midnight the Lord smokeote. So God
[1:16:52] waited when it's dark.
[1:16:54] &gt;&gt; Yes. all the firstborn in the land of
[1:16:56] Egypt, from the firstborn of Pharaoh
[1:17:00] that sat on his throne to the firstborn
[1:17:03] of the captive that was in the dungeon,
[1:17:06] and all the firstborn of the cattle,
[1:17:08] even animals. Verse
[1:17:11] 30. And Pharaoh rose up in the night. He
[1:17:15] and all his servant and all the Egyptian
[1:17:19] and there was a great cry in Egypt for
[1:17:23] there was not a house
[1:17:26] &gt;&gt; where there was not what
[1:17:28] &gt;&gt; one day.
[1:17:28] &gt;&gt; So everybody in Egypt have a problem at
[1:17:32] death.
[1:17:33] &gt;&gt; So this is not just a night of darkness
[1:17:37] but it's a dreadful night.
[1:17:41] a bad memorial.
[1:17:44] &gt;&gt; Everybody's screaming. In other words,
[1:17:45] you're sleeping. The whole city,
[1:17:48] &gt;&gt; the whole country is screaming.
[1:17:50] &gt;&gt; Everywhere. Every state is screaming.
[1:17:53] &gt;&gt; What is going on? There is death
[1:17:55] everywhere.
[1:17:57] &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham said this death
[1:17:59] here was the last plague.
[1:18:02] [Applause]
[1:18:04] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:18:06] &gt;&gt; So the last plague
[1:18:09] according to brother Brandham was deaf
[1:18:11] and according to the scripture are we
[1:18:13] together and we know that the last
[1:18:16] plague for the gentile age
[1:18:20] &gt;&gt; there is four horse riders
[1:18:22] &gt;&gt; you don't want me to go back to that
[1:18:24] again
[1:18:25] &gt;&gt; amen we got a white one
[1:18:28] &gt;&gt; the next one is a red one then we got a
[1:18:31] black one and the pale one his name was
[1:18:34] what
[1:18:34] &gt;&gt; death
[1:18:35] &gt;&gt; so the last rather the last anointing is
[1:18:38] water.
[1:18:38] &gt;&gt; Death.
[1:18:39] &gt;&gt; And the last thing before Israel leave
[1:18:41] Egypt is water.
[1:18:43] &gt;&gt; We clear so far?
[1:18:44] &gt;&gt; So the last plague before the Exodus,
[1:18:47] before departure is death. It's an angel
[1:18:51] of death.
[1:18:55] &gt;&gt; A pale horse.
[1:18:56] &gt;&gt; We clear so far?
[1:18:57] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:18:58] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:18:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:00] &gt;&gt; Jump to verse 34. So we save time.
[1:19:04] In 34 the Bible say you know the story
[1:19:07] and the people took their door
[1:19:10] &gt;&gt; before it was what
[1:19:12] &gt;&gt; leaven
[1:19:13] &gt;&gt; their what
[1:19:14] &gt;&gt; meeting troughs
[1:19:15] &gt;&gt; being bound up being bound up with their
[1:19:18] clothing upon their water
[1:19:20] &gt;&gt; shoulders
[1:19:21] &gt;&gt; they didn't take the bread
[1:19:24] &gt;&gt; they were making the bread
[1:19:26] &gt;&gt; are we together
[1:19:28] &gt;&gt; so Israel for some reason started to
[1:19:32] make bread.
[1:19:34] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:19:35] &gt;&gt; So they took the flour
[1:19:38] and mix it with water.
[1:19:43] &gt;&gt; This is what makes dough
[1:19:46] &gt;&gt; or what you call paste.
[1:19:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:50] &gt;&gt; The next step you add leaven.
[1:19:54] &gt;&gt; If you don't know how to cook, you can
[1:19:56] learn right here how to cook bread. Are
[1:19:58] we together?
[1:20:00] Are we together? This is the first step.
[1:20:03] &gt;&gt; The next step is when you put leaven.
[1:20:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, Israel started to cook.
[1:20:12] &gt;&gt; They had a vision of bread,
[1:20:15] &gt;&gt; but they never could accomplish or
[1:20:17] finish the cooking in the land of Egypt.
[1:20:23] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:20:24] &gt;&gt; So, before the Exodus,
[1:20:27] &gt;&gt; there will be certain things you will
[1:20:29] start.
[1:20:31] That's right.
[1:20:32] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:20:34] &gt;&gt; With a project to finish.
[1:20:38] &gt;&gt; But in the middle of the road
[1:20:40] &gt;&gt; of your project, the rapture will catch
[1:20:43] you.
[1:20:46] &gt;&gt; Are we together? And you will exit
[1:20:48] leaving your construction work.
[1:20:51] [Music]
[1:20:54] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:20:56] &gt;&gt; Are we together? I just took an example
[1:20:58] for construction work. You won't be
[1:21:00] exiting this world.
[1:21:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:03] &gt;&gt; Leaving your bank account.
[1:21:05] [Applause]
[1:21:05] [Music]
[1:21:06] [Applause]
[1:21:08] &gt;&gt; I'm trying to move on.
[1:21:10] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:21:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:12] &gt;&gt; According to the way you were planning
[1:21:14] is I'm going to do this and finish.
[1:21:16] &gt;&gt; So there are things you will finish.
[1:21:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:19] &gt;&gt; And there are things you won't be able
[1:21:21] to finish.
[1:21:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:23] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:21:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:25] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:21:26] &gt;&gt; So does it mean that we need to stop?
[1:21:29] You don't know what what it is.
[1:21:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:33] &gt;&gt; Whether it's going to be a building off
[1:21:35] a house, whether it's going to be a
[1:21:37] finishing off a career or maybe it's
[1:21:39] going to be a graduated from school. In
[1:21:41] other words, you may start school.
[1:21:45] &gt;&gt; Maybe on your junior year, the rapture
[1:21:47] come.
[1:21:52] &gt;&gt; If you want to continue in the
[1:21:53] tribulation, that's your problem.
[1:21:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:21:58] &gt;&gt; We clear so far?
[1:21:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:00] &gt;&gt; Job to verse uh 35. And the children of
[1:22:03] Israel did according to the water.
[1:22:06] &gt;&gt; Word of Moses.
[1:22:07] &gt;&gt; We need to know this word of Moses.
[1:22:09] &gt;&gt; And they did what?
[1:22:11] &gt;&gt; Borrowed.
[1:22:12] &gt;&gt; Last Sunday we saw that the word is the
[1:22:14] ask.
[1:22:15] &gt;&gt; So Moses told them to ask. I have the
[1:22:18] scripture. I have another scripture
[1:22:19] where Moses say that if you need it, you
[1:22:22] ask me. I will give it to you. It's
[1:22:23] right here in the book of Exodus. If you
[1:22:25] go to Exodus 11, you will see at the
[1:22:27] beginning Moses talked to them.
[1:22:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:30] &gt;&gt; So they already got a message of Moses.
[1:22:32] We went through that last Sunday. And
[1:22:34] the children of Israel did according to
[1:22:37] the word of Moses. And they ask or they
[1:22:40] borrow of who?
[1:22:41] &gt;&gt; The Egyptians.
[1:22:42] &gt;&gt; What?
[1:22:42] &gt;&gt; Jewels of silver.
[1:22:43] &gt;&gt; And jewels of what?
[1:22:45] &gt;&gt; Gold.
[1:22:45] &gt;&gt; You remember there was a promise with
[1:22:47] Abraham. You remember that last Sunday?
[1:22:49] And what?
[1:22:49] &gt;&gt; Raymond.
[1:22:53] They ask for what?
[1:22:55] &gt;&gt; Silver.
[1:22:57] &gt;&gt; Jewel of what?
[1:22:58] &gt;&gt; Silver.
[1:23:00] &gt;&gt; And jewels of what?
[1:23:01] &gt;&gt; Gold.
[1:23:05] &gt;&gt; You love material, brother. And what
[1:23:08] else?
[1:23:08] &gt;&gt; Raymond.
[1:23:14] &gt;&gt; Clothing.
[1:23:17] &gt;&gt; Because Raymond sounds fancy.
[1:23:22] Amen.
[1:23:23] &gt;&gt; Who who told them to ask?
[1:23:28] &gt;&gt; Can you answer me?
[1:23:29] &gt;&gt; Who told them to ask?
[1:23:31] &gt;&gt; And Moses got instruction from who?
[1:23:36] &gt;&gt; So who told Israel to ask?
[1:23:39] &gt;&gt; And if God tells you to ask
[1:23:45] &gt;&gt; because the Bible says ask and it shall
[1:23:48] be what?
[1:23:50] So when God say ask,
[1:23:52] &gt;&gt; it means it's already there
[1:23:55] &gt;&gt; and it's available to be given to you.
[1:23:59] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together.
[1:24:01] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together.
[1:24:03] &gt;&gt; Why? Why? Why is God saying asking if
[1:24:06] it's not there?
[1:24:09] &gt;&gt; When God say ask what he told you to ask
[1:24:11] is already there.
[1:24:14] &gt;&gt; And God is specific.
[1:24:16] &gt;&gt; Ask jewels of what? Silver
[1:24:18] &gt;&gt; and water
[1:24:20] &gt;&gt; and watering.
[1:24:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:29] &gt;&gt; Verse 36. And the Lord gave the people
[1:24:32] what?
[1:24:33] &gt;&gt; Favor.
[1:24:35] &gt;&gt; Who gave favor?
[1:24:37] &gt;&gt; The Lord.
[1:24:37] &gt;&gt; So when God as tells you to ask,
[1:24:41] &gt;&gt; what what have God already put on you?
[1:24:44] &gt;&gt; Favor. favor to receive what you are
[1:24:46] about to ask.
[1:24:51] &gt;&gt; Are we together, sister Lily?
[1:24:53] &gt;&gt; If God say ask
[1:24:55] &gt;&gt; and it shall be what?
[1:24:57] &gt;&gt; Because there is an anointing
[1:24:59] &gt;&gt; there is a favor.
[1:25:01] &gt;&gt; So when everybody's crying in Egypt,
[1:25:05] &gt;&gt; some people are happy
[1:25:08] &gt;&gt; because the season has come.
[1:25:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:12] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:25:16] Are we together?
[1:25:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:18] &gt;&gt; In one side of the same place, it's
[1:25:21] darkness.
[1:25:22] &gt;&gt; It's mooning.
[1:25:24] &gt;&gt; People are sad. People are crying. But
[1:25:27] on the other side, on the other hand,
[1:25:30] &gt;&gt; amen. Of the same place, some are
[1:25:32] rejoicing
[1:25:34] &gt;&gt; because their bills have been wiped out.
[1:25:41] When somebody is talking about the
[1:25:43] economy and the tariffs going higher,
[1:25:47] somebody else is having bills wiped out
[1:25:50] without paying a penny.
[1:25:53] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:25:54] &gt;&gt; A season on the other side of darkness.
[1:25:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:00] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:26:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:01] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:26:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:03] &gt;&gt; This season is between the It's before
[1:26:07] right before the Exodus.
[1:26:09] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen.
[1:26:10] &gt;&gt; When it's too dark,
[1:26:13] &gt;&gt; when death is in the land,
[1:26:15] &gt;&gt; but the exodus has not happened yet.
[1:26:18] &gt;&gt; In that season,
[1:26:19] &gt;&gt; that's a great deal, brother.
[1:26:21] &gt;&gt; In that time,
[1:26:22] &gt;&gt; you need to watch.
[1:26:24] &gt;&gt; You need to open up your eyes
[1:26:26] &gt;&gt; because there is two anointing that are
[1:26:28] working.
[1:26:29] &gt;&gt; One is working in Egypt,
[1:26:32] &gt;&gt; in the world, and another one is in Gan.
[1:26:36] &gt;&gt; Are we together? So if you are in gosh,
[1:26:39] don't be looking at the news of Egypt.
[1:26:43] &gt;&gt; Change your news channel.
[1:26:47] &gt;&gt; Stop looking at CNN.
[1:26:50] &gt;&gt; Stop looking at the news.
[1:26:52] &gt;&gt; Turn to Malachi 4 news.
[1:26:56] &gt;&gt; Malachi 4 will tell you what need to be
[1:26:59] taken at this time.
[1:27:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:03] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:27:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:07] Glory to God. Sister ROF, try to adjust
[1:27:10] my ear here on on my on my monitor,
[1:27:12] please, if you can. And Sister Adas, you
[1:27:14] can refocus. Amen.
[1:27:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:16] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:27:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:17] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:27:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:18] &gt;&gt; The Bible say, "And the Lord gave the
[1:27:20] people what?
[1:27:21] &gt;&gt; Favor
[1:27:22] &gt;&gt; in the sight of what?
[1:27:23] &gt;&gt; The Egyptians."
[1:27:24] &gt;&gt; So that they did what?
[1:27:25] &gt;&gt; Lent unto them such things.
[1:27:27] &gt;&gt; They gave unto them such things as the
[1:27:29] water
[1:27:29] &gt;&gt; required.
[1:27:30] &gt;&gt; And they did what?
[1:27:31] &gt;&gt; Spoiled the Egyptians. Do you know the
[1:27:33] very word spoil means what?
[1:27:35] &gt;&gt; It means there was a war.
[1:27:38] &gt;&gt; Come on.

[1:28:38] they work for it?
[1:28:39] &gt;&gt; No, sir.
[1:28:40] &gt;&gt; No, sir.
[1:28:40] &gt;&gt; Did they pay for it?
[1:28:42] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:28:42] &gt;&gt; Did they invest for it?
[1:28:44] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:28:45] &gt;&gt; Did they sweat for it?
[1:28:46] &gt;&gt; So, who was working?
[1:28:49] &gt;&gt; So, who worked for those things?

[1:29:08] &gt;&gt; Are we together? So God gave them favor
[1:29:12] &gt;&gt; to accumulate.

[1:29:31] &gt;&gt; I'm going to put it into you through
[1:29:34] provision.
[1:29:35] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:29:37] &gt;&gt; The Bible says in the book of what?
[1:29:39] &gt;&gt; Ecclesiastes
[1:29:40] &gt;&gt; verse uh chapter 2 verse what?
[1:29:42] &gt;&gt; 26.
[1:29:43] &gt;&gt; For God giveth to a man that is good in
[1:29:46] his sight. He gave him what?
[1:29:48] &gt;&gt; Wisdom
[1:29:48] &gt;&gt; and water
[1:29:49] &gt;&gt; and knowledge
[1:29:50] &gt;&gt; and water
[1:29:50] &gt;&gt; and joy.
[1:29:51] &gt;&gt; How many are good in the sight of the

[1:29:59] &gt;&gt; Did you see? He say he give you money.
[1:30:01] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:30:02] &gt;&gt; Now let's continue. He say but to the
[1:30:04] water
[1:30:04] &gt;&gt; sinner
[1:30:05] &gt;&gt; he give him water
[1:30:06] &gt;&gt; travail
[1:30:07] &gt;&gt; to do what?
[1:30:08] &gt;&gt; To gather
[1:30:08] &gt;&gt; and water
[1:30:09] &gt;&gt; to heap up
[1:30:10] &gt;&gt; that he may give to him that is what
[1:30:13] &gt;&gt; good before God.
[1:30:17] &gt;&gt; I I hope you understanding me.
[1:30:22] [Applause]
[1:30:24] You can stay in your faith. Me, I'm
[1:30:26] climbing higher here.
[1:30:28] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:30:30] &gt;&gt; Why am I climbing higher? When Adam sin,
[1:30:34] &gt;&gt; God cursed the ground.
[1:30:37] &gt;&gt; And he said that thorn and tiss
[1:30:40] &gt;&gt; will be coming from the ground.
[1:30:42] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:30:43] &gt;&gt; But at the cross,
[1:30:45] &gt;&gt; brother.
[1:30:46] &gt;&gt; Come on, brother. When Jesus died, they
[1:30:49] took a a crown of stone and they put
[1:30:52] upon Jesus Christ because he was
[1:30:54] removing the curse of Adam.
[1:30:59] &gt;&gt; Are we together? So the curse of labor
[1:31:02] is not in us.
[1:31:04] &gt;&gt; It is upon the sinners.
[1:31:08] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. I hope we are
[1:31:11] together. Sinner are the one that are
[1:31:14] supposed to be straining,
[1:31:16] &gt;&gt; not Christian
[1:31:18] &gt;&gt; because somebody paid for it.
[1:31:24] &gt;&gt; I'm going to read it again.
[1:31:26] &gt;&gt; I'm going to read it again.
[1:31:29] &gt;&gt; It's the Bible.
[1:31:31] &gt;&gt; Ah, the Bible say for but to the who?
[1:31:35] &gt;&gt; Sinner.
[1:31:36] &gt;&gt; Not the Christian. He give what?
[1:31:38] &gt;&gt; Travail.
[1:31:39] &gt;&gt; So who's supposed to travail? You
[1:31:41] &gt;&gt; sinner
[1:31:43] &gt;&gt; travail come out to do what?
[1:31:45] &gt;&gt; To gather
[1:31:46] &gt;&gt; and to do what?
[1:31:46] &gt;&gt; To heap up
[1:31:47] &gt;&gt; the Egyptian that he may the purpose
[1:31:50] &gt;&gt; that he may give to him. That is how
[1:31:53] &gt;&gt; good before God.
[1:31:55] &gt;&gt; So tell God where is my bank account?
[1:32:02] &gt;&gt; I I I hope you are together. When Elijah
[1:32:06] When Elijah needed bread,
[1:32:08] &gt;&gt; God never sent an eagle.
[1:32:11] &gt;&gt; He sent a crow.
[1:32:13] &gt;&gt; It was the crow that was bringing bread.
[1:32:18] &gt;&gt; Where did he get the c the bread? That's
[1:32:21] not my problem.
[1:32:23] &gt;&gt; As long as I can get my sandwich.
[1:32:26] [Applause]
[1:32:29] [Music]

[1:37:07] &gt;&gt; My God is real.
[1:37:09] &gt;&gt; Yes, I can feel it down in my soul. We
[1:37:13] need a miracle. He is the miracle
[1:37:15] worker.
[1:37:18] &gt;&gt; God of the impossible.
[1:37:23] [Applause]
[1:37:24] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God.
[1:37:27] &gt;&gt; Let's go to Job 27 so we can come back
[1:37:29] quickly. I'm still reading the Bible. We
[1:37:32] have not start preaching yet. I'm
[1:37:33] reading the Bible. Let's go to Job 27.
[1:37:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:36] &gt;&gt; In case you wonder when is he going to
[1:37:38] start preaching? Not yet. Let's go to
[1:37:40] Job 27. If you there you can say amen.
[1:37:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:43] &gt;&gt; Verse 13. This is the portion of who
[1:37:46] &gt;&gt; a wicked man.
[1:37:47] &gt;&gt; Are you wicked here?
[1:37:48] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:37:48] &gt;&gt; Is anybody wicked here?
[1:37:50] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:37:50] &gt;&gt; So this is not your portion.
[1:37:52] &gt;&gt; But I just need to be informed about the
[1:37:55] portion of the wicked.
[1:37:57] &gt;&gt; Why do you need it? There could be a
[1:37:59] blessing in the wicked portion.
[1:38:02] &gt;&gt; We just saw here that when the wicked
[1:38:05] work me I'm sleeping.
[1:38:09] &gt;&gt; Don't worry my friend. First, this is
[1:38:11] the portion of what?
[1:38:12] &gt;&gt; A wicked man.
[1:38:13] &gt;&gt; With who?
[1:38:14] &gt;&gt; With God.
[1:38:14] &gt;&gt; And the heritage of what?
[1:38:16] &gt;&gt; Oppressors.
[1:38:17] &gt;&gt; Who? You know that who was oppressing
[1:38:19] Israel? The Egyptian.
[1:38:21] &gt;&gt; So now this is the portion of the
[1:38:23] Egyptian. And the and the heritage of
[1:38:25] the water
[1:38:26] &gt;&gt; oppressors
[1:38:26] &gt;&gt; which they shall receive of who?
[1:38:28] &gt;&gt; The Almighty. So the wicked and the
[1:38:30] people that are oppressing you, that
[1:38:32] give you hard time,
[1:38:35] &gt;&gt; that are tormenting me all the time,
[1:38:37] they have an an inheritance and a
[1:38:39] portion. I'm not going to read all of
[1:38:41] them, but I'm trying to knock what is
[1:38:42] right here. You can read it at home. Job
[1:38:45] to verse 16.
[1:38:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:47] &gt;&gt; Though he does what? The wicked
[1:38:49] &gt;&gt; heap up silver as the dust.
[1:38:52] &gt;&gt; And though he heap up silver as what?
[1:38:54] &gt;&gt; The dust.
[1:38:55] &gt;&gt; Though he up silver as the dust. Though
[1:38:58] he up
[1:39:00] &gt;&gt; the death.
[1:39:00] &gt;&gt; So this man is very rich.
[1:39:05] &gt;&gt; He's working his head off.
[1:39:08] &gt;&gt; He cannot sleep
[1:39:09] &gt;&gt; all the time. He's in his computer.
[1:39:11] &gt;&gt; He's working. If you look at him, he's a
[1:39:14] rich man. Let's see what is he working
[1:39:16] for. He said though he up silver as the
[1:39:19] what?
[1:39:19] &gt;&gt; The dust
[1:39:20] &gt;&gt; and prepare what?
[1:39:22] &gt;&gt; Raymond
[1:39:23] &gt;&gt; as what?
[1:39:24] &gt;&gt; The clay
[1:39:24] &gt;&gt; so many clothing. Verse 17. He may
[1:39:28] prepare it.
[1:39:30] &gt;&gt; Come on. But the just shall do what?
[1:39:33] &gt;&gt; Put it on.
[1:39:33] &gt;&gt; So, who's going to wear the clothing?
[1:39:37] &gt;&gt; I'm going with the Bible.
[1:39:39] &gt;&gt; Who's going to who's going to wear the
[1:39:40] clothing?
[1:39:41] &gt;&gt; So, who's putting up the clothing?
[1:39:44] &gt;&gt; Now, you understand why God told the
[1:39:46] Egyp the Israelite, "Go get the
[1:39:49] clothing."
[1:39:50] &gt;&gt; He says that it's the just who does what
[1:39:53] &gt;&gt; put it on. And the innocent shall divide
[1:39:57] the what?
[1:39:57] &gt;&gt; Silver.
[1:39:58] &gt;&gt; So the the wife of the riches is put for
[1:40:01] who?
[1:40:03] &gt;&gt; For the righteous one.
[1:40:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:07] &gt;&gt; Free.
[1:40:08] &gt;&gt; To believe
[1:40:09] &gt;&gt; or to reject.
[1:40:11] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:40:12] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:40:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:13] &gt;&gt; Let's go back where we were.
[1:40:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. Verse 36. And the Lord gave them
[1:40:26] what?
[1:40:26] &gt;&gt; Favor
[1:40:27] &gt;&gt; in the sight of what?
[1:40:28] &gt;&gt; The Egyptians.
[1:40:29] &gt;&gt; So that they l to them such things as
[1:40:32] the water
[1:40:32] &gt;&gt; required.
[1:40:33] &gt;&gt; And they spoiled the Egyptian.
[1:40:35] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:40:36] &gt;&gt; Now when they pick up these jewels of
[1:40:39] silver
[1:40:40] &gt;&gt; and the jeweler of gold and his clothing
[1:40:42] on remnant, what did they do with it
[1:40:47] &gt;&gt; when they were leaving Egypt? Because
[1:40:48] they didn't start building the
[1:40:50] tabernacle right away. So God was
[1:40:53] picking up that. So according to us, the
[1:40:56] way we are very humble, maybe when they
[1:40:58] pick up the the the jewels of silver,
[1:41:01] you know what? We going into the
[1:41:03] wilderness. What are we going to do with
[1:41:04] it? Just keep it keep it here. So we see
[1:41:07] what the Lord will tell us what to do
[1:41:10] with it
[1:41:12] &gt;&gt; according to us.
[1:41:14] &gt;&gt; Because we don't need silver, brother.
[1:41:15] We don't need gold. We don't what I have
[1:41:18] is okay. Ah, I don't need I don't need
[1:41:20] any more clothing. I have enough. I
[1:41:23] don't need it. I'm okay. Let's see who
[1:41:27] what was the purpose of God in picking
[1:41:30] up this thing.
[1:41:31] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:41:33] &gt;&gt; Go to Exodus 3.
[1:41:36] &gt;&gt; I'm still reading the Bible. We going to
[1:41:38] climb soon. Amen.
[1:41:40] &gt;&gt; Go to Exodus 3. If you there, you can
[1:41:43] say amen. Amen.
[1:41:45] &gt;&gt; You know, Exodus 3 is when God met Moses
[1:41:48] as a pillar on fire.
[1:41:50] &gt;&gt; In a burning bush. Amen.
[1:41:52] &gt;&gt; Now, God is talking to Moses. You there?
[1:41:56] &gt;&gt; Exodus 3, if you there, you can say
[1:41:57] amen.
[1:41:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:58] &gt;&gt; Verse 21, God said to Moses, I will give
[1:42:02] this people what?
[1:42:04] &gt;&gt; Favor.
[1:42:04] &gt;&gt; Do you see that?
[1:42:05] &gt;&gt; In the sight of what?
[1:42:07] &gt;&gt; The Egyptians. And it shall come to pass
[1:42:09] that when you go
[1:42:13] &gt;&gt; you shall not go how
[1:42:15] &gt;&gt; empty.
[1:42:19] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen to the word?
[1:42:21] &gt;&gt; So God didn't want Israel to leave Egypt
[1:42:25] empty.
[1:42:32] &gt;&gt; It's hard.
[1:42:33] &gt;&gt; It's hard.
[1:42:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.

[1:42:54] &gt;&gt; It's your own trial.
[1:42:57] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:42:59] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:43:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:00] &gt;&gt; God did not want Israel to leave how. So
[1:43:04] who was providing for Israel?
[1:43:07] &gt;&gt; We clear so far.
[1:43:09] &gt;&gt; Are we clear?
[1:43:10] &gt;&gt; Next verse. Verse 22. But every what?
[1:43:14] &gt;&gt; Woman,
[1:43:14] &gt;&gt; sister.
[1:43:16] &gt;&gt; Yes.

[1:43:17] &gt;&gt; Borrow of her neighbor.
[1:43:18] &gt;&gt; Ask for from who?
[1:43:20] &gt;&gt; Neighbor.
[1:43:21] &gt;&gt; From neighborama.
[1:43:23] And of her that in what?
[1:43:25] &gt;&gt; Her house.
[1:43:26] &gt;&gt; In other words, if the neighbor have a
[1:43:29] visitor,
[1:43:32] &gt;&gt; you
[1:43:34] Hey,
[1:43:35] &gt;&gt; can we read together?
[1:43:37] &gt;&gt; Not only so now there is an exception.
[1:43:40] &gt;&gt; He was not only Egyptian.
[1:43:42] &gt;&gt; Whoever was a resident
[1:43:45] [Applause]
[1:43:46] &gt;&gt; in Egypt
[1:43:48] &gt;&gt; was also subject
[1:43:51] &gt;&gt; to work for Israel.
[1:43:53] &gt;&gt; In other words, when you go to the
[1:43:55] house,
[1:43:56] &gt;&gt; you say, "I know you an American,
[1:43:59] &gt;&gt; but I saw a brother that came somebody
[1:44:01] came from Italy. Even him too.
[1:44:05] &gt;&gt; Whoever came from Africa, him too.
[1:44:08] &gt;&gt; Whoever came from another country,
[1:44:12] &gt;&gt; even him too.
[1:44:13] &gt;&gt; In other words, not only Egyptian but
[1:44:16] even the resident,
[1:44:18] &gt;&gt; the stranger that were in Egypt,
[1:44:21] &gt;&gt; God already trapped all of them.
[1:44:26] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:44:28] &gt;&gt; Are we together? So your bank God has
[1:44:30] extended now.
[1:44:34] Amen.
[1:44:35] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:44:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:37] &gt;&gt; Ah,
[1:44:37] &gt;&gt; spiritual people. But every woman shall
[1:44:40] borrow of what?
[1:44:41] &gt;&gt; Her neighbor
[1:44:42] &gt;&gt; and and of her that did what?
[1:44:44] &gt;&gt; To journeth in her house.
[1:44:45] &gt;&gt; Borrow what?
[1:44:46] &gt;&gt; Jewels of silver.
[1:44:47] &gt;&gt; We know that. And what?
[1:44:49] &gt;&gt; Jewels of gold.
[1:44:50] &gt;&gt; And what?
[1:44:50] &gt;&gt; And Raymond.
[1:44:51] &gt;&gt; And you shall put them upon who?
[1:44:54] &gt;&gt; Your sons.
[1:44:58] &gt;&gt; Say amen. It's the Bible. You shall put
[1:45:01] on upon who?
[1:45:03] &gt;&gt; Your sons
[1:45:03] &gt;&gt; and who?
[1:45:04] &gt;&gt; Your daughters.
[1:45:05] &gt;&gt; And you shall do what?
[1:45:06] &gt;&gt; For the Egyptians.
[1:45:08] &gt;&gt; So the the wealth the blessing God is
[1:45:11] giving you,
[1:45:12] &gt;&gt; it's it's it's extended to who?
[1:45:16] [Music]
[1:45:18] [Applause]
[1:45:21] &gt;&gt; You didn't get that. Well,
[1:45:23] &gt;&gt; God is telling you go get the wealth.
[1:45:27] &gt;&gt; But the wealth is going to who?
[1:45:31] So when they were leaving Egypt, how was
[1:45:34] Israel dressed?
[1:45:37] &gt;&gt; Please answer me.
[1:45:39] &gt;&gt; We trying to move on.
[1:45:42] &gt;&gt; The poor children
[1:45:44] &gt;&gt; of the slave. Now they look how
[1:45:48] &gt;&gt; rich
[1:45:49] &gt;&gt; are we together?
[1:45:51] &gt;&gt; So your blessing is going down to your
[1:45:53] children.
[1:45:55] &gt;&gt; Are we together? So when Israel is
[1:45:58] walking out
[1:45:59] &gt;&gt; and they look at the children maybe the
[1:46:02] friend ask why do you look so good
[1:46:06] &gt;&gt; so the child have a testimony
[1:46:09] &gt;&gt; he say you know what my father serve the
[1:46:11] living God
[1:46:13] &gt;&gt; and because of that that's why I look
[1:46:15] like this
[1:46:17] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together
[1:46:18] &gt;&gt; amen
[1:46:19] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together
[1:46:20] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together
[1:46:21] &gt;&gt; amen
[1:46:22] &gt;&gt; your father didn't get the money yet
[1:46:25] &gt;&gt; but you got the money at the end.
[1:46:27] &gt;&gt; Maybe your father was not smart in
[1:46:30] school,
[1:46:31] &gt;&gt; but because he serve a living God,
[1:46:33] &gt;&gt; your grade in school, brother Elijah
[1:46:37] must be a testimony.
[1:46:41] &gt;&gt; When the people are looking at our
[1:46:43] children, why are you having a daddy
[1:46:47] serve a living God? Because my father
[1:46:50] serve a living God. The testimony goes
[1:46:52] to the next generation.
[1:46:56] [Applause]
[1:46:59] Are we together?
[1:47:00] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:47:02] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:47:03] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:47:04] &gt;&gt; So God is providing for the entire
[1:47:06] family.
[1:47:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:10] &gt;&gt; This happened slightly before the Exodus
[1:47:15] &gt;&gt; when everybody else is crying there.
[1:47:17] &gt;&gt; Listen to this my friend. Then we move
[1:47:19] to our second our third scripture in the
[1:47:21] Psalm 104 105 verse 37. The Bible says
[1:47:25] what?
[1:47:26] &gt;&gt; He brought them forth also.
[1:47:27] &gt;&gt; He brought Israel forth also with what?
[1:47:29] &gt;&gt; With silver and gold.
[1:47:31] &gt;&gt; We already seen that. And there was not
[1:47:36] &gt;&gt; in the wilderness when they were leaving
[1:47:38] Egypt.
[1:47:39] &gt;&gt; There was not what?
[1:47:40] &gt;&gt; One feeble person among their tribes.
[1:47:43] &gt;&gt; Not one.
[1:47:45] &gt;&gt; So everybody was healthy.
[1:47:48] There is
[1:47:51] [Music]
[1:47:54] &gt;&gt; Let me read it again.
[1:47:56] &gt;&gt; We're talking about Exodus.
[1:47:58] &gt;&gt; Remember what happened in the first
[1:48:00] Exodus was under the pillar of fire. It
[1:48:03] came to the second exodus. And that same
[1:48:06] pillar of fire came into the third
[1:48:08] Exodus. And Jesus Christ is the same
[1:48:11] &gt;&gt; yesterday, today and forever.
[1:48:14] &gt;&gt; So what happened over there must happen
[1:48:16] here.
[1:48:20] I hope we are together.
[1:48:22] &gt;&gt; In other words, before we leave this
[1:48:24] world,
[1:48:25] &gt;&gt; no sickness,
[1:48:27] &gt;&gt; no sickness,
[1:48:29] &gt;&gt; not a trace of sickness must be found in
[1:48:32] our body.
[1:48:35] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:48:38] &gt;&gt; Are we together? That's why we receive
[1:48:40] glorified body
[1:48:43] &gt;&gt; because sickness must leave.
[1:48:46] God must send the healing anointing
[1:48:50] &gt;&gt; because the son of righteousness is
[1:48:52] rising with healing
[1:48:55] &gt;&gt; in his wings.
[1:48:57] &gt;&gt; So no one
[1:49:00] s
[1:49:02] &gt;&gt; No one should be what?
[1:49:06] &gt;&gt; If you believe it, say amen.
[1:49:09] &gt;&gt; I didn't hear it from this side.
[1:49:11] &gt;&gt; If you believe it, say amen.
[1:49:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. Even if you sick, say amen.
[1:49:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:21] &gt;&gt; You don't look at the symptom. Look at
[1:49:23] the word.
[1:49:25] &gt;&gt; You said so. I believe it. And I said
[1:49:28] it.
[1:49:32] [Applause]
[1:49:35] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:49:37] &gt;&gt; The brother not feeble. Sisters not
[1:49:41] feeble. children,
[1:49:43] &gt;&gt; everybody healthy.
[1:49:45] &gt;&gt; Are we clear?
[1:49:46] &gt;&gt; Let's go to Isaiah 60.
[1:49:50] &gt;&gt; This is our last scripture. Then you
[1:49:52] turn your clock and we start preaching.
[1:50:00] &gt;&gt; I'm sorry if you got a lot of tummy like
[1:50:02] this. We need to stretch it.
[1:50:11] If you need the quote, you see me.
[1:50:14] &gt;&gt; Isaiah 60. If you dare, you can say
[1:50:16] amen.
[1:50:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:18] &gt;&gt; If you dare, you can say amen.
[1:50:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:21] &gt;&gt; Verse one.
[1:50:23] Arise. You remember this.
[1:50:26] &gt;&gt; And do what?
[1:50:27] &gt;&gt; Shine.
[1:50:30] &gt;&gt; Arise means you were not standing.
[1:50:33] &gt;&gt; You already understand that.
[1:50:37] &gt;&gt; And do what?
[1:50:38] &gt;&gt; Shine.
[1:50:38] &gt;&gt; So you were not shining.
[1:50:41] Amen.
[1:50:43] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:50:44] &gt;&gt; Arise and shine. Why?
[1:50:47] &gt;&gt; For thy light is come.
[1:50:49] &gt;&gt; The light of who?
[1:50:53] &gt;&gt; The light of who?
[1:50:54] &gt;&gt; Thy light.
[1:50:57] &gt;&gt; Your light has come.
[1:51:02] &gt;&gt; Is it the light of brother Charles?
[1:51:05] &gt;&gt; It is my light. Yes sir.
[1:51:07] &gt;&gt; Brother CH have to apply the scripture
[1:51:09] to himself.
[1:51:10] &gt;&gt; God is saying
[1:51:11] &gt;&gt; eras.
[1:51:14] &gt;&gt; He didn't say and shine the light.
[1:51:17] &gt;&gt; Because shine the light means you taking
[1:51:19] like a flashlight and you begin to
[1:51:21] shine. Uhuh. Uhuh. Uh-uh. The flashlight
[1:51:24] is not you.
[1:51:25] &gt;&gt; God is saying your light. So there is a
[1:51:28] light that belong to you.
[1:51:30] &gt;&gt; And your light have come.
[1:51:32] &gt;&gt; And when your light come, you now are
[1:51:35] shining.
[1:51:36] Amen.
[1:51:37] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:51:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:38] &gt;&gt; The Bible say, "Arise and do what?"
[1:51:40] &gt;&gt; Shine.
[1:51:41] &gt;&gt; Why? Because thy light has water.
[1:51:44] &gt;&gt; It's come.
[1:51:45] &gt;&gt; Remember last Sunday we saw in first uh
[1:51:49] John 1 verse 5 that the Bible says this
[1:51:53] then is the message. I'm just catching
[1:51:56] up something. Which we have heard of him
[1:51:59] and declare unto you that God is what?
[1:52:02] &gt;&gt; Light.
[1:52:04] God is what?
[1:52:05] &gt;&gt; Light.
[1:52:07] &gt;&gt; So God
[1:52:11] is light.
[1:52:14] &gt;&gt; Oh, light
[1:52:18] &gt;&gt; is what?
[1:52:23] &gt;&gt; Yeah, you will struggle but I don't have
[1:52:24] any choice. Amen. And in him in God
[1:52:29] there is what?
[1:52:30] &gt;&gt; No darkness at all. Amen.
[1:52:34] &gt;&gt; So the characteristic of God, if you
[1:52:36] open God, you look inside.
[1:52:41] &gt;&gt; No darkness.
[1:52:43] &gt;&gt; It's all light.
[1:52:45] &gt;&gt; Thank you. In Revelation 22, when we So
[1:52:48] the Bible say, "And the city has no need
[1:52:50] of what?
[1:52:51] &gt;&gt; The sun.
[1:52:52] &gt;&gt; Neither of what?
[1:52:52] &gt;&gt; The moon
[1:52:53] &gt;&gt; to do what?
[1:52:54] &gt;&gt; To shine in it."
[1:52:56] &gt;&gt; Why? For because the water
[1:52:59] &gt;&gt; the glory of God
[1:53:00] &gt;&gt; is doing what? the light
[1:53:02] &gt;&gt; and the lamp is what?
[1:53:04] &gt;&gt; The light thereof.
[1:53:05] &gt;&gt; So they don't need the light because
[1:53:06] there is already a light
[1:53:08] &gt;&gt; but the light is a person.
[1:53:12] &gt;&gt; Because the lamb is Jesus Christ.
[1:53:14] &gt;&gt; John the Baptist said, "Behold the lamb
[1:53:16] of God."
[1:53:17] &gt;&gt; So the lamb
[1:53:21] is the light. So God is light
[1:53:25] &gt;&gt; and that light is the lamp. So light is
[1:53:27] lamb and light is God. Amen.
[1:53:30] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:53:31] &gt;&gt; Now the Bible say arise and shine
[1:53:35] &gt;&gt; for what?
[1:53:37] &gt;&gt; Your light has come.
[1:53:40] &gt;&gt; But light is what?
[1:53:42] &gt;&gt; If your light has come,
[1:53:44] &gt;&gt; what have come to you?
[1:53:48] [Applause]
[1:53:50] [Music]
[1:53:52] &gt;&gt; Because Jesus say my sheep.
[1:53:55] &gt;&gt; He he already call you sheep. If he call
[1:53:58] you sheep
[1:53:59] &gt;&gt; and the scripture say in Psalm 82, ye
[1:54:02] are what?
[1:54:08] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:54:09] &gt;&gt; Now the Bible say arise and do what?
[1:54:12] &gt;&gt; For what has come.
[1:54:14] &gt;&gt; So your God, your your divine portion
[1:54:19] &gt;&gt; has come.
[1:54:23] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:54:25] &gt;&gt; Are we together? The Bible says in the
[1:54:27] book of James that God James chapter one
[1:54:30] probably 17 the Bible say that God is
[1:54:33] the father of what?
[1:54:36] &gt;&gt; Lights plural. So a father of light give
[1:54:38] birth to what?
[1:54:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:54:43] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:54:44] &gt;&gt; So he will give birth to the light like
[1:54:46] in the day of Pentecost.
[1:54:48] &gt;&gt; It was the father that was giving birth.
[1:54:51] &gt;&gt; He said this one is Charles. This one is
[1:54:53] Greg. This one is uh Kayla. This one,
[1:54:55] it's the father of light. And the Bible
[1:54:57] say now rise
[1:55:00] &gt;&gt; and shine because your light,
[1:55:03] &gt;&gt; your godship,
[1:55:05] [Music]
[1:55:07] &gt;&gt; your God part,
[1:55:10] [Applause]
[1:55:14] &gt;&gt; your deity
[1:55:17] has come.
[1:55:21] &gt;&gt; Your deity. In other words, you have a
[1:55:23] portion of you that is God.
[1:55:26] &gt;&gt; But now that portion has come.
[1:55:31] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:55:32] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:55:34] &gt;&gt; He said, "Arise and shine. The light has
[1:55:36] what?
[1:55:37] &gt;&gt; Come
[1:55:38] &gt;&gt; and the glory of the Lord has th
[1:55:40] &gt;&gt; is risen upon thee."
[1:55:42] &gt;&gt; For behold, what?
[1:55:43] &gt;&gt; The darkness shall cover the earth.
[1:55:45] &gt;&gt; Why do you need to shine? What is coming
[1:55:47] down on the earth?
[1:55:48] &gt;&gt; Darkness.
[1:55:49] &gt;&gt; So God is sending what?
[1:55:50] &gt;&gt; Light. So when darkness is coming down,
[1:55:53] what else is coming down?
[1:55:56] [Music]
[1:55:58] &gt;&gt; In other words, the moving
[1:56:03] [Music]
[1:56:06] &gt;&gt; that's why brother Brandham say when you
[1:56:07] recognize this message
[1:56:10] &gt;&gt; to be eagleful you heard from who?
[1:56:13] &gt;&gt; So where is that theophony?
[1:56:16] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. I hope we are
[1:56:19] together. So at the same time darkness
[1:56:22] is coming.
[1:56:23] &gt;&gt; No, in other words, God is responding to
[1:56:26] what is happening.
[1:56:29] &gt;&gt; Satan is coming down. God also is coming
[1:56:32] down.
[1:56:34] [Applause]
[1:56:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:37] &gt;&gt; The God I'm talking is your God is
[1:56:39] coming down.
[1:56:40] &gt;&gt; Not the God of Jesus Christ.
[1:56:44] &gt;&gt; Your your your God.
[1:56:46] &gt;&gt; Your God is also coming down.
[1:56:52] My God is different than your God.
[1:56:55] &gt;&gt; My God look like me.
[1:56:59] &gt;&gt; He fits me.
[1:57:02] [Applause]
[1:57:03] &gt;&gt; It's a It's another brother Steven.
[1:57:07] &gt;&gt; It's a divine person. When he get to me,
[1:57:11] he's charging you.
[1:57:13] &gt;&gt; Now I become a light.
[1:57:16] [Applause]
[1:57:19] I don't know if you together.
[1:57:22] &gt;&gt; I don't know if you together.
[1:57:25] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:57:26] &gt;&gt; In other words, you are living without a
[1:57:28] battery.
[1:57:29] &gt;&gt; Your battery has come.
[1:57:31] &gt;&gt; Put your battery on.
[1:57:34] &gt;&gt; Turn the cell phone on.
[1:57:36] &gt;&gt; Shout because the battery has come.
[1:57:39] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:57:40] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:57:42] &gt;&gt; So at the same time, darkness is coming.
[1:57:47] Amen.
[1:57:48] &gt;&gt; Lights also
[1:57:50] &gt;&gt; are coming.
[1:57:54] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:57:55] &gt;&gt; So depending on where are you looking
[1:57:57] at?
[1:57:59] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[1:58:01] &gt;&gt; What do you see? Darkness. Darkness.
[1:58:03] Darkness. Darkness. What do you see
[1:58:05] also?
[1:58:07] [Applause]
[1:58:09] [Music]
[1:58:12] &gt;&gt; Let's continue. Verse two. For behold
[1:58:15] what?
[1:58:15] &gt;&gt; The darkness shall cover the earth.
[1:58:17] &gt;&gt; What type of darkness?
[1:58:18] &gt;&gt; Gross darkness.
[1:58:20] &gt;&gt; If the darkness are gross.
[1:58:25] &gt;&gt; So for a light to shine on a gross
[1:58:28] darkness, what intensity
[1:58:31] &gt;&gt; should be that light?
[1:58:34] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:58:35] &gt;&gt; I don't know why it's difficult.
[1:58:38] &gt;&gt; Glory. Glory.
[1:58:39] &gt;&gt; You see this picture right here?
[1:58:41] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. If you if you look uh look
[1:58:44] brother Brham is doing what?
[1:58:47] Look at his face. Look at him.
[1:58:51] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham is doing what?
[1:58:54] &gt;&gt; That that light above him is doing what?
[1:58:57] &gt;&gt; What is around all of them?
[1:59:02] &gt;&gt; What do you see in that picture?
[1:59:04] &gt;&gt; What is around that picture?
[1:59:09] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Amen.
[1:59:14] &gt;&gt; Do you see something here?
[1:59:15] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:59:16] &gt;&gt; Do you see something here?
[1:59:17] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:59:18] &gt;&gt; Can you tell what is there?
[1:59:20] &gt;&gt; Can you tell what is here?
[1:59:22] &gt;&gt; But you can tell this individual
[1:59:24] &gt;&gt; and these are clearly defined.
[1:59:29] &gt;&gt; Arise and shine
[1:59:31] &gt;&gt; because his light has come and the glory
[1:59:34] of the Lord is risen above you.
[1:59:39] [Applause]
[1:59:41] This is your picture right there. The
[1:59:43] glory of the Lord. But I am also a
[1:59:46] light.
[1:59:48] [Applause]
[1:59:50] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. So in that
[1:59:53] picture there are two light.
[1:59:55] &gt;&gt; It is the glory of the Lord. But brother
[1:59:58] also is a light
[2:00:02] &gt;&gt; just like you are a light.
[2:00:05] &gt;&gt; But if you look around them, guess what?
[2:00:08] darkness.
[2:00:11] &gt;&gt; If I ask you what do you see in that
[2:00:13] picture?
[2:00:15] &gt;&gt; You will say I see who.
[2:00:18] &gt;&gt; Somebody will say I see who.
[2:00:21] &gt;&gt; None of you will answer me that I see
[2:00:23] darkness.
[2:00:24] &gt;&gt; None of you will answer me darkness.
[2:00:26] &gt;&gt; None of you will answer me darkness. All
[2:00:28] of you will say I see brother with the
[2:00:31] pillar of fire. Why didn't you see
[2:00:33] darkness?
[2:00:36] But it's there.
[2:00:38] &gt;&gt; So darkness is not really catching you.
[2:00:41] &gt;&gt; What is catching you is the image
[2:00:45] &gt;&gt; of the light
[2:00:46] &gt;&gt; and the prophet
[2:00:48] &gt;&gt; because the light and the prophet speak
[2:00:50] to you
[2:00:52] [Music]
[2:00:54] &gt;&gt; because I will send you Elijah. I will
[2:00:56] send you
[2:00:57] &gt;&gt; Elijah the prophet.
[2:00:59] &gt;&gt; So there is a light. There is you and
[2:01:02] there is Elijah the prophet. I hope we
[2:01:04] are together. I hope we are together.
[2:01:07] Arise and shine. The light has come.
[2:01:09] Verse two. For behold, they what?
[2:01:12] &gt;&gt; The darkness
[2:01:13] &gt;&gt; shall do what?
[2:01:14] &gt;&gt; Cover the earth
[2:01:15] &gt;&gt; and gross water.
[2:01:16] &gt;&gt; Darkness the people.
[2:01:17] &gt;&gt; But the Lord shall arise upon who?
[2:01:21] &gt;&gt; Thee.
[2:01:21] &gt;&gt; Where is that pillar of fire?
[2:01:24] &gt;&gt; Upon who?
[2:01:25] &gt;&gt; Upon thee.
[2:01:26] &gt;&gt; Upon who?
[2:01:27] &gt;&gt; Upon me. Upon brother Brano.
[2:01:29] &gt;&gt; Upon brother Brano. And the Lord shall
[2:01:32] ar remember yesterday in question and
[2:01:34] answer.
[2:01:35] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[2:01:36] &gt;&gt; Because some of you want to see
[2:01:39] &gt;&gt; those that were yesterday knows what I'm
[2:01:41] talking about when we talked about
[2:01:42] perception. Do you know that this pillar
[2:01:44] of fire nobody saw it?
[2:01:47] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:01:47] &gt;&gt; Do you know that nobody saw it?
[2:01:50] &gt;&gt; It was seen through the camera.
[2:01:53] &gt;&gt; So why do you want to see your light in
[2:01:55] your eyes with your eyes?
[2:01:59] It's there.
[2:02:01] [Applause]
[2:02:03] &gt;&gt; It's there.
[2:02:05] &gt;&gt; It's another dimension. Remember
[2:02:07] yesterday, it's another dimension.
[2:02:12] &gt;&gt; Don't worry, my friend. Sooner you will
[2:02:14] begin to take picture and you will see
[2:02:16] lights.
[2:02:17] [Music]
[2:02:21] &gt;&gt; Because when the rapture will come, I
[2:02:23] will see him coming.
[2:02:26] I leave it alone
[2:02:28] &gt;&gt; because you you you need to know how
[2:02:30] will the rapture happen
[2:02:32] &gt;&gt; and what's going to happen even when you
[2:02:34] sleep you will know I have coat and
[2:02:35] everything laid up
[2:02:37] &gt;&gt; are we together he says and gross
[2:02:39] darkness upon the people but the lord
[2:02:41] shall arise upon who
[2:02:43] &gt;&gt; thee
[2:02:43] &gt;&gt; and his glory shall be seen where
[2:02:46] &gt;&gt; upon thee
[2:02:46] &gt;&gt; so when you see brother Brandham what do
[2:02:48] you see
[2:02:49] &gt;&gt; glory
[2:02:50] &gt;&gt; the glory of the lord upon who
[2:02:52] &gt;&gt; him
[2:02:53] &gt;&gt; and what happened to the messenger is an
[2:02:56] example
[2:02:58] &gt;&gt; because it's the wave chief that have
[2:03:00] been waved upon the people.
[2:03:02] &gt;&gt; So that the remaining of the audience
[2:03:06] &gt;&gt; must be the same.
[2:03:10] [Applause]
[2:03:14] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:03:15] &gt;&gt; Are we together? We found out that this
[2:03:18] prophecy of Isaiah 60, brother Brandham
[2:03:21] say it pertain to our day.
[2:03:24] Amen.
[2:03:25] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:03:26] &gt;&gt; The Bible I mean brother Brandham say
[2:03:28] gross darkness where
[2:03:30] &gt;&gt; of of of course this is a prophesying of
[2:03:34] the day that we are living when
[2:03:36] &gt;&gt; now
[2:03:36] &gt;&gt; I'm not going to go back again because
[2:03:38] we gave a full picture last Sunday. Let
[2:03:40] me touch it up and get to what we are
[2:03:42] supposed to get. Amen. We found out that
[2:03:45] brother Brham say where it is strange
[2:03:47] but it's in this age of what?
[2:03:50] &gt;&gt; Plenty.
[2:03:50] &gt;&gt; An age of what? Opportunity
[2:03:56] &gt;&gt; age of what?
[2:03:57] &gt;&gt; Plenty.
[2:03:58] &gt;&gt; And what?
[2:03:59] &gt;&gt; Opportunity.
[2:04:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:04] &gt;&gt; Let's move on quickly. Brother Brham say
[2:04:06] when everyone has water
[2:04:08] &gt;&gt; so much
[2:04:09] &gt;&gt; and there is what
[2:04:10] &gt;&gt; so much more to be had.
[2:04:12] &gt;&gt; What with all the water
[2:04:14] &gt;&gt; inventions
[2:04:14] &gt;&gt; to do our work dishwasher whatever and
[2:04:18] so many thing to give us what
[2:04:19] &gt;&gt; pleasure. Suddenly we found what
[2:04:22] &gt;&gt; mental illness
[2:04:23] &gt;&gt; taking such a toll as what
[2:04:25] &gt;&gt; to alarm the nation
[2:04:26] &gt;&gt; when everybody ought to be happy with
[2:04:29] really nothing to be unhappy about but
[2:04:32] million are taking what
[2:04:34] &gt;&gt; seditives at night.
[2:04:35] &gt;&gt; If you taking sedative at night
[2:04:38] &gt;&gt; we must seize it
[2:04:43] &gt;&gt; because there must be a difference
[2:04:44] between you and the people of the world.
[2:04:50] Are we together?
[2:04:51] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Put the tape on.
[2:04:57] &gt;&gt; Cut brother tape on
[2:04:59] &gt;&gt; and focus a little be on the tape.
[2:05:02] &gt;&gt; Before you know it, you already gone.
[2:05:09] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:05:10] &gt;&gt; Are we together? He says sedative at
[2:05:12] night and what?
[2:05:14] &gt;&gt; Pet pills in the morning.
[2:05:15] So you need something to boost you in
[2:05:17] the morning.
[2:05:19] &gt;&gt; Really, you need something to boost you
[2:05:20] in the morning.
[2:05:21] &gt;&gt; Find the season, my friend.
[2:05:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:25] &gt;&gt; I don't need to take something to boost
[2:05:27] me in the morning because my light has
[2:05:29] come.
[2:05:31] &gt;&gt; My children has come.
[2:05:34] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:05:36] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham continue. He says,
[2:05:38] "Rushing to what?
[2:05:39] &gt;&gt; The doctors
[2:05:40] &gt;&gt; entering what?
[2:05:41] &gt;&gt; Institutions
[2:05:42] &gt;&gt; trying to drone out unknown fear by
[2:05:44] what? alcohol
[2:05:45] &gt;&gt; and yet the bo that of this tremendous
[2:05:47] store of wly good but the people are
[2:05:50] less water
[2:05:51] &gt;&gt; happy than ever
[2:05:52] &gt;&gt; this age boasts of water
[2:05:53] &gt;&gt; it's spiritual attainment
[2:05:55] &gt;&gt; but the people are less sure of themsel
[2:05:57] than what
[2:05:58] &gt;&gt; we talked about last Sunday this age
[2:06:00] boast of what
[2:06:01] &gt;&gt; better moral value
[2:06:03] &gt;&gt; and it's more corrupt than any age sees
[2:06:06] what
[2:06:06] &gt;&gt; the flood
[2:06:07] &gt;&gt; and God put you in this more in the more
[2:06:10] corrupted
[2:06:12] &gt;&gt; that's where God put you
[2:06:16] Because you have a light
[2:06:19] &gt;&gt; that must shine but your light require
[2:06:22] gross darkness.
[2:06:23] [Applause]
[2:06:27] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:06:28] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.
[2:06:28] &gt;&gt; Let's continue. Brother Brham says this.
[2:06:31] He says and he says the next verse will
[2:06:34] be to the other churches. This is a
[2:06:36] decent church commanding other churches.
[2:06:40] God command them. I know your work. I
[2:06:42] know what you did. I know this and
[2:06:44] there. He said, but he did not command
[2:06:47] this church.
[2:06:49] &gt;&gt; Laisha, there is nothing to praise him.
[2:06:51] &gt;&gt; If you go to the book of Revelation from
[2:06:53] the beginning of Laodisha all the way to
[2:06:55] the end, it's just rebuke after rebuke
[2:06:57] after rebuke. There is nothing God
[2:06:59] praises the age.
[2:07:00] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham say he didn't command
[2:07:02] this age. He had just what?
[2:07:04] &gt;&gt; Complain against it.
[2:07:06] &gt;&gt; Not a command. He didn't command this
[2:07:08] age for what?
[2:07:09] &gt;&gt; Nothing.
[2:07:10] &gt;&gt; Which age?
[2:07:12] a bad age,
[2:07:14] &gt;&gt; nothing to praise,
[2:07:16] &gt;&gt; the edge,
[2:07:17] &gt;&gt; nothing.
[2:07:18] &gt;&gt; And we found out last Sunday that under
[2:07:21] the seventh seal, remember this. Now,
[2:07:23] back up, my friend. Under the seventh
[2:07:26] seal, there was a losing
[2:07:29] &gt;&gt; of an ekles, a demonic spirit
[2:07:33] &gt;&gt; was given permission under the seven
[2:07:35] seal.
[2:07:36] &gt;&gt; Are we are we together? to darken the
[2:07:39] moon or the church.
[2:07:43] &gt;&gt; Don't worry, my friend. The Bible say,
[2:07:45] notice the losing of this what?
[2:07:47] &gt;&gt; Ecclesiastical spirit.
[2:07:48] &gt;&gt; Now, 20 years later after that war, we
[2:07:51] already talked about it. We see the
[2:07:53] losing of which spirit?
[2:07:54] &gt;&gt; The ecclesiastical spirit.
[2:07:56] &gt;&gt; What? Under
[2:07:56] &gt;&gt; the seventh seal,
[2:07:58] &gt;&gt; the seventh trumpet to the what?
[2:07:59] &gt;&gt; To the Jew.
[2:08:00] &gt;&gt; In other words, this seal, this message
[2:08:02] here must go to the Jews.
[2:08:06] And remember when he goes to the Jews,
[2:08:08] it's in the tribulation period.
[2:08:10] &gt;&gt; It looks like this message work in
[2:08:13] trouble.
[2:08:15] [Applause]
[2:08:18] &gt;&gt; When the devil is coming really high,
[2:08:21] &gt;&gt; the the the the remedy,
[2:08:24] &gt;&gt; the answer is this message.
[2:08:29] [Applause]
[2:08:32] A season on the other side of darkness.
[2:08:36] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham say look at the moon
[2:08:38] which is the church doing what?
[2:08:39] &gt;&gt; Darkening out.
[2:08:41] &gt;&gt; Where under? See it Jonah the son of man
[2:08:44] being what?
[2:08:44] &gt;&gt; Drove from the church.
[2:08:46] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:08:47] &gt;&gt; And look at this my friend. Brother
[2:08:49] Brham says we are living in a what?
[2:08:52] &gt;&gt; Neurotic age
[2:08:53] &gt;&gt; with what?
[2:08:54] &gt;&gt; Nervous tension. Everybody is racing
[2:08:56] here
[2:08:57] &gt;&gt; and going there and going where?
[2:09:00] &gt;&gt; Nowhere.
[2:09:01] &gt;&gt; It's just to that kind of an age. And I
[2:09:04] know this church
[2:09:07] &gt;&gt; br tabernacle would be what?
[2:09:10] &gt;&gt; Plagued with it.
[2:09:11] &gt;&gt; As what?
[2:09:12] &gt;&gt; As everywhere
[2:09:13] &gt;&gt; is plagued with it. Tabernacle is what?
[2:09:15] &gt;&gt; Plagued with it.
[2:09:16] &gt;&gt; Everywhere. The whole what?
[2:09:18] &gt;&gt; The whole world.
[2:09:19] &gt;&gt; Brother Brham is saying even the
[2:09:21] Brandham tabernacle
[2:09:22] &gt;&gt; was plagued with tension. Amen.
[2:09:26] &gt;&gt; Everywhere, every nation is what?
[2:09:28] Tension. And God put you in a tension
[2:09:31] age.
[2:09:37] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:09:38] &gt;&gt; Tension a bad thing.
[2:09:41] &gt;&gt; Let me continue. Brother Brandham says
[2:09:43] this. He says it's a day of what?
[2:09:46] &gt;&gt; Pleasure.
[2:09:47] &gt;&gt; What's going on?
[2:09:49] &gt;&gt; Hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry up and do
[2:09:52] what?
[2:09:52] &gt;&gt; Wait.
[2:09:53] drive 90 m an hour and then get home for
[2:09:57] what supper and wait how many hours?
[2:10:00] &gt;&gt; 2 hours till it gets ready
[2:10:06] &gt;&gt; on the highway.
[2:10:08] &gt;&gt; Get home. You start waiting. What is
[2:10:10] going on? Pressure. Follow me my friend.
[2:10:13] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham say that's right. It is
[2:10:15] what
[2:10:15] &gt;&gt; a time
[2:10:16] &gt;&gt; and it's that rushing of what
[2:10:18] &gt;&gt; and speeding.
[2:10:19] &gt;&gt; It gets you to a water
[2:10:20] &gt;&gt; a nervous tension. The wife says
[2:10:22] something a little contrary. You want to
[2:10:25] do what?
[2:10:26] &gt;&gt; Fly off.
[2:10:27] &gt;&gt; The husband says something, you pat your
[2:10:29] foot
[2:10:30] &gt;&gt; and tell him what?
[2:10:31] &gt;&gt; To get in the room.
[2:10:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:10:37] &gt;&gt; Don't move. Stay in the sanctuary.
[2:10:39] &gt;&gt; Let me handle this.
[2:10:43] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:10:44] &gt;&gt; It looks like argument every day.
[2:10:47] &gt;&gt; No conversation without argument.
[2:10:51] Who put you in the guard?
[2:10:55] &gt;&gt; Follow me my friend.
[2:10:57] &gt;&gt; Follow me my friend. Brother Brown say
[2:10:59] well now husband I don't want no word
[2:11:02] with you
[2:11:04] &gt;&gt; go.
[2:11:05] &gt;&gt; And wife say what?
[2:11:07] &gt;&gt; I'm so nervous.
[2:11:07] &gt;&gt; I am so nervous. Some of us are like
[2:11:16] &gt;&gt; are we together? Brother say why?
[2:11:20] &gt;&gt; What's the matter?
[2:11:22] &gt;&gt; Can I continue?
[2:11:23] &gt;&gt; This is the matter. Brother say some
[2:11:26] people try to do what?
[2:11:28] &gt;&gt; Introduce Christianity
[2:11:29] &gt;&gt; that you are free from what?
[2:11:31] &gt;&gt; Worry.
[2:11:32] &gt;&gt; No, you are not
[2:11:40] &gt;&gt; season where
[2:11:41] &gt;&gt; on the other side of darkness.
[2:11:43] &gt;&gt; Don't worry my friend, we getting there.
[2:11:45] Brother say you are not
[2:11:50] &gt;&gt; slow down. I know. Swallow. Just
[2:11:53] swallow. Swallow.
[2:11:54] &gt;&gt; And we coming there. Amen. Brother
[2:11:56] Brandham say you are not. You are free
[2:11:58] from what?
[2:11:59] &gt;&gt; Tension.
[2:12:00] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham say what?
[2:12:01] &gt;&gt; Oh no.
[2:12:03] &gt;&gt; Oh no. You do what?
[2:12:04] &gt;&gt; Tension.
[2:12:05] &gt;&gt; When you become what?
[2:12:06] &gt;&gt; A Christian.
[2:12:08] Amen.
[2:12:14] &gt;&gt; Let me continue. My friend brother said
[2:12:16] because you was kind of what
[2:12:19] &gt;&gt; a stop go
[2:12:20] &gt;&gt; and what
[2:12:20] &gt;&gt; happy go
[2:12:22] &gt;&gt; whatever he was out there not caring
[2:12:24] about what you did.
[2:12:26] &gt;&gt; You can just catch somebody and go.
[2:12:32] &gt;&gt; You see somebody on the highway stick a
[2:12:34] finger move on. You don't even remember
[2:12:36] you stick a finger.
[2:12:42] But when you become a Christian
[2:12:44] &gt;&gt; suddenly tension
[2:12:47] &gt;&gt; but remember the only burden.
[2:12:50] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[2:12:52] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[2:12:53] &gt;&gt; That is a tension sir
[2:12:55] &gt;&gt; or a stone
[2:12:57] &gt;&gt; to go higher is an eagle.
[2:13:00] [Applause]
[2:13:06] You didn't get me, my friend.
[2:13:08] &gt;&gt; Paul was the anointing of a lion.
[2:13:12] &gt;&gt; The dark ages were the anointing of an
[2:13:14] ox.
[2:13:15] &gt;&gt; The reformer were the anointing of a
[2:13:18] man.
[2:13:19] &gt;&gt; But this anointing today is the
[2:13:21] anointing of what?
[2:13:23] &gt;&gt; Not just an eagle, a what?
[2:13:26] &gt;&gt; Flying and flying eagle meets storm.
[2:13:32] Yes.
[2:13:33] &gt;&gt; He required dark storm, really dark
[2:13:36] storm to push the eagle up.
[2:13:39] &gt;&gt; That's why after every trial, you go
[2:13:41] higher.
[2:13:43] &gt;&gt; After every trial, you go higher.
[2:13:47] &gt;&gt; You didn't get me.
[2:13:49] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:13:50] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:13:51] &gt;&gt; Sister Lily, the faith you have today
[2:13:54] &gt;&gt; is more than what you had yesterday.

[2:14:04] &gt;&gt; sister if that tension the car the first
[2:14:07] car didn't break down the second car
[2:14:09] didn't break down it was the two car

[2:14:21] &gt;&gt; credit to qualify no money for down
[2:14:24] payment no go outside the car is over
[2:14:27] [Applause]
[2:14:28] [Music]
[2:14:32] Are we together?
[2:14:33] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Sister George, are we
[2:14:35] together? It took tension.
[2:14:37] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says this. Glory to
[2:14:39] God. He says, but when you become a
[2:14:42] what?
[2:14:42] &gt;&gt; A real Christian.
[2:14:44] &gt;&gt; Every moment you are just what?
[2:14:46] &gt;&gt; Wondering.
[2:14:46] &gt;&gt; Am I pleasing my Lord?
[2:14:48] &gt;&gt; If I could hear from him, he put you
[2:14:50] how?
[2:14:51] &gt;&gt; On tension.
[2:14:52] &gt;&gt; Put you how?
[2:14:53] &gt;&gt; On guard. That is what makes you what
[2:14:55] you are.
[2:15:00] &gt;&gt; People say you are a sweet person.
[2:15:02] &gt;&gt; They don't know it takes tension to keep
[2:15:04] you sweet.
[2:15:06] &gt;&gt; You a wonderful believer. We never seen
[2:15:09] an employee like you. It took tension
[2:15:12] &gt;&gt; so that when you at work every seven you
[2:15:15] say, "Have I said something wrong?
[2:15:17] &gt;&gt; Have I done something wrong? I want to
[2:15:19] make sure I'm always ready."
[2:15:22] &gt;&gt; Are we together? And it keep you line
[2:15:24] up.
[2:15:25] &gt;&gt; You need it.
[2:15:28] &gt;&gt; Stay in the sanctuary. Don't go
[2:15:30] anywhere.
[2:15:31] &gt;&gt; The brother problem say he says what
[2:15:34] after all tension is what
[2:15:36] &gt;&gt; a blessing.
[2:15:39] [Applause]
[2:15:40] [Music]
[2:15:40] [Applause]
[2:15:44] &gt;&gt; In other words, that darkness that you
[2:15:46] see around is a blessing.
[2:15:51] I hope we are together.
[2:15:53] &gt;&gt; He said tension is water.
[2:15:54] &gt;&gt; A blessing.
[2:15:55] &gt;&gt; It's just the way you are water
[2:15:57] &gt;&gt; looking at it.
[2:15:59] &gt;&gt; It's just the way you are. What?
[2:16:01] &gt;&gt; Looking at it.
[2:16:02] &gt;&gt; If you just look to the other side, no
[2:16:04] matter how thin you do, what?
[2:16:06] &gt;&gt; Slice anything.

[2:16:08] &gt;&gt; Two sides. Two.
[2:16:09] &gt;&gt; So you want to look at how many side?
[2:16:11] &gt;&gt; Both sides.
[2:16:12] &gt;&gt; The other side people are crying.
[2:16:15] &gt;&gt; It's darkness. beful. The other side, I
[2:16:18] got favor from God
[2:16:20] &gt;&gt; to get everything I want.
[2:16:25] [Applause]
[2:16:30] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:16:31] &gt;&gt; Listen to this, my friend. If you can
[2:16:33] swallow this. Speaking of what?
[2:16:36] &gt;&gt; Speaking of what?
[2:16:37] &gt;&gt; Tension.
[2:16:38] &gt;&gt; I was praying about it this morning.
[2:16:40] &gt;&gt; Ah, glory to God. Brother Brandham was
[2:16:43] praying about tension. So, finally, we
[2:16:44] got the answer. Let's get the answer
[2:16:46] that he got after praying for tension.
[2:16:49] &gt;&gt; Are we ready?
[2:16:50] &gt;&gt; He said, "I was praying about it this
[2:16:52] morning. What would you do
[2:16:55] &gt;&gt; if you didn't have tension?"
[2:16:58] &gt;&gt; Just think of it.
[2:17:00] &gt;&gt; Tension is a what?
[2:17:05] &gt;&gt; Read it, my friend.
[2:17:06] &gt;&gt; Tension is part of living.
[2:17:08] &gt;&gt; I'm I'm getting you somewhere.
[2:17:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:17:11] &gt;&gt; Tension is not a curse. It's a fuel.
[2:17:16] &gt;&gt; That's exactly right.
[2:17:18] &gt;&gt; When you want to preach here, you will
[2:17:20] feel it coming up
[2:17:22] &gt;&gt; because it keep you on your toes. It
[2:17:23] keep you consecrated. It keep you prayed
[2:17:25] up all the time because you getting into
[2:17:28] a different. If not, you will be joking
[2:17:31] &gt;&gt; and people are waiting to hear from God.
[2:17:34] &gt;&gt; Are we together? He said tension is
[2:17:36] what?
[2:17:37] &gt;&gt; Part of living.
[2:17:40] &gt;&gt; Tension. Blackness is part of that
[2:17:42] picture.
[2:17:43] If you want to see brother bra,
[2:17:47] &gt;&gt; if you want to see the pillar of fire
[2:17:49] really good, you need the dark
[2:17:51] background.
[2:17:54] &gt;&gt; You need the dark a black background.
[2:17:58] Then you going to see it clearly.
[2:18:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[2:18:04] &gt;&gt; Brother Bradam say he say if that kind
[2:18:07] of what
[2:18:08] &gt;&gt; encouraged me when I
[2:18:09] &gt;&gt; when I thought about it if you had no
[2:18:11] tension
[2:18:12] &gt;&gt; you be like a rag doll
[2:18:15] &gt;&gt; you wouldn't have what
[2:18:17] &gt;&gt; no feelings
[2:18:18] &gt;&gt; there be nothing you could work on like
[2:18:20] a husband and what
[2:18:22] &gt;&gt; wife
[2:18:23] &gt;&gt; maybe if she want to do something and
[2:18:26] they are trying to work together
[2:18:28] especially who
[2:18:29] &gt;&gt; Christians
[2:18:30] &gt;&gt; so who will get more attention
[2:18:32] &gt;&gt; Christians
[2:18:37] I hope it's helping you now better.
[2:18:39] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:18:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:18:41] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:18:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:18:42] &gt;&gt; Because when it happen, you go low on
[2:18:45] your faith.
[2:18:46] &gt;&gt; You say, "Lord, I'm not I'm not where
[2:18:48] I'm supposed to be. I'm supposed to be
[2:18:50] above." No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
[2:18:52] no, no. You need that pressure
[2:18:55] &gt;&gt; because that pressure put your husband
[2:18:57] back in place. Yes, it does.
[2:19:00] Because if a husband does everything and
[2:19:02] it's yes yes yes yes, he's going to fall
[2:19:05] on the ditch.
[2:19:06] &gt;&gt; He need a shook proof
[2:19:08] &gt;&gt; to send him to spin and think twice and
[2:19:11] finally he put him.
[2:19:13] &gt;&gt; Don't say amen. Let me continue. Let me
[2:19:16] continue. Let me continue.
[2:19:20] Do you think God put you together for
[2:19:22] nothing?
[2:19:25] &gt;&gt; Huh? God put you together so you can say
[2:19:27] yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. You are there
[2:19:30] for yes and no.
[2:19:32] &gt;&gt; No. If it's contrary to the word no.
[2:19:37] [Applause]
[2:19:39] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:19:40] &gt;&gt; He say especially who
[2:19:42] &gt;&gt; Christians
[2:19:43] &gt;&gt; and the one and the other ones. And then
[2:19:46] when you come together you find out that
[2:19:48] what she's done. She found out. See the
[2:19:51] tension he do what?
[2:19:52] &gt;&gt; Close brings you closer together.
[2:19:57] &gt;&gt; I want to do this. No. No. No, no. Me, I
[2:19:59] don't see this. No, no, no, no, no, no,
[2:20:01] no. After My God, she was right.
[2:20:06] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[2:20:09] &gt;&gt; Honey, I'm sorry.
[2:20:12] &gt;&gt; You were right.
[2:20:17] &gt;&gt; He took that
[2:20:20] &gt;&gt; and the light comes.
[2:20:22] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:20:23] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Amen.
[2:20:24] &gt;&gt; So, the tension really does what?
[2:20:26] &gt;&gt; Brings you closer together. That's why
[2:20:28] be careful when you're dealing with
[2:20:30] married people.
[2:20:33] &gt;&gt; Even when they mad
[2:20:36] &gt;&gt; and this one say I can't take no more.
[2:20:39] &gt;&gt; Last thing I'm leaving tomorrow you see
[2:20:41] both of them.
[2:20:44] &gt;&gt; It's like they are playing games.
[2:20:47] &gt;&gt; If you look you say are you really
[2:20:49] playing games? You are mad. This one say
[2:20:51] I don't want him tomorrow honey. I'm
[2:20:54] sorry. And guess what? more love
[2:20:57] &gt;&gt; and another baby.
[2:20:59] [Applause]
[2:21:06] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:21:07] &gt;&gt; Are we together? And where is the devil
[2:21:10] after all?
[2:21:12] &gt;&gt; And you see them 30 years marriage, 40
[2:21:15] years marriage. They were tension in
[2:21:17] between, but they can't separate.
[2:21:25] Are we together?
[2:21:27] &gt;&gt; Are we together,
[2:21:29] &gt;&gt; brother?
[2:21:31] &gt;&gt; Have I said something wrong?
[2:21:33] &gt;&gt; Anyway, it's the word of God. Shake
[2:21:34] somebody beside you.
[2:21:43] &gt;&gt; This is the word of God. Whoever is
[2:21:46] making you sleep is the devil.
[2:21:48] &gt;&gt; Because you don't sleep at hard.
[2:21:50] &gt;&gt; You don't sleep at work. You don't sleep
[2:21:52] at the party. So you can't sleep right
[2:21:54] here.
[2:21:55] [Music]
[2:21:58] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:21:59] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:22:01] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. Brother say, "And somebody tells
[2:22:04] you that well, just think of the little
[2:22:06] wife that went under a lot of tension
[2:22:08] when you was not good and the husband
[2:22:10] went under a lot of tension when you was
[2:22:12] not good.
[2:22:13] &gt;&gt; Then when it's all forgiven, look how
[2:22:16] you feel about him.
[2:22:18] My
[2:22:20] &gt;&gt; you got to have
[2:22:22] &gt;&gt; tension
[2:22:26] &gt;&gt; brother Bradom. So tension. Oh my. What
[2:22:30] is this tension? If I could have been
[2:22:32] born without this tension. Well if I
[2:22:35] would have had this tension if I would
[2:22:37] not have distension I would have been
[2:22:40] what I I would not have been what I am.
[2:22:43] &gt;&gt; I would not have been a Christian
[2:22:45] perhaps.
[2:22:47] It was this tension
[2:22:50] &gt;&gt; that drove me to Jesus Christ.
[2:22:56] &gt;&gt; It's been a blessing thing to me
[2:23:02] &gt;&gt; brother Steven.
[2:23:04] &gt;&gt; So you are saying blessing tension is
[2:23:07] good
[2:23:10] &gt;&gt; are we together? When we look at Psalm
[2:23:14] last Sunday, we found that David said,
[2:23:16] "The Lord does what?"
[2:23:17] &gt;&gt; Reignth.
[2:23:18] &gt;&gt; And let the earth do what?
[2:23:20] &gt;&gt; Rejoice.
[2:23:20] &gt;&gt; Let the multitude of shel be what?
[2:23:23] &gt;&gt; Glad thereof.
[2:23:24] &gt;&gt; Cloud and what?
[2:23:25] &gt;&gt; And darkness.
[2:23:26] &gt;&gt; And where?
[2:23:26] &gt;&gt; Round about him.
[2:23:28] &gt;&gt; Even God himself.
[2:23:30] &gt;&gt; According to David, around God, what do
[2:23:32] we see?
[2:23:33] &gt;&gt; Darkness.
[2:23:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:23:37] &gt;&gt; How can light himself? God is light.
[2:23:39] &gt;&gt; And around him there is what? Darkness,
[2:23:42] &gt;&gt; cloud and darkness.
[2:23:44] &gt;&gt; What is the purpose of darkness?
[2:23:47] &gt;&gt; Psalm uh 139 David continue. He said,
[2:23:50] "If I say surely the darkness shall do
[2:23:53] what?"
[2:23:54] &gt;&gt; Cover me.
[2:23:55] &gt;&gt; Even the night shall be light about me.
[2:23:58] &gt;&gt; Why? Because there is a light in David
[2:24:02] &gt;&gt; that no matter how much darkness you
[2:24:04] put,
[2:24:05] &gt;&gt; it turn everything into light.
[2:24:07] &gt;&gt; Are we together? And David say, "Yeah,
[2:24:10] the darkness hideth not from thee, from
[2:24:13] God. But the night shineth as what?"
[2:24:16] &gt;&gt; The day.
[2:24:17] &gt;&gt; The darkness and the light are both a
[2:24:19] light to who?
[2:24:20] &gt;&gt; To thee.
[2:24:21] &gt;&gt; In other words, to God.
[2:24:23] Whether you put darkness or you put
[2:24:25] light, it doesn't matter.
[2:24:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:24:29] &gt;&gt; So God doesn't see darkness the way you
[2:24:31] see
[2:24:31] &gt;&gt; it.
[2:24:33] &gt;&gt; Because the one who created darkness is
[2:24:35] God.
[2:24:36] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:24:37] &gt;&gt; Right there, brother.
[2:24:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:24:39] to God. Darkness and light are the same.
[2:24:42] &gt;&gt; And you are God.
[2:24:45] &gt;&gt; So you need to change it the way you
[2:24:47] look in a darkness.
[2:24:49] &gt;&gt; Darkness to God is just as the light.
[2:24:53] &gt;&gt; In other words, darkness is not a reason
[2:24:56] to for God to stop what he's doing.
[2:24:59] &gt;&gt; Darkness is not an obstacle.
[2:25:01] &gt;&gt; It's not a hindrance.
[2:25:03] &gt;&gt; It is nothing.
[2:25:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[2:25:06] [Music]
[2:25:08] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together.
[2:25:10] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together.
[2:25:12] &gt;&gt; Some of us working in the in the day.
[2:25:15] &gt;&gt; Some of us work at night.
[2:25:17] &gt;&gt; Did the night hinder you from working?
[2:25:19] You who work night shift?
[2:25:23] &gt;&gt; It didn't do anything.
[2:25:25] &gt;&gt; So if you work night shift, what is
[2:25:27] night to you?
[2:25:30] &gt;&gt; What is night for you?
[2:25:32] &gt;&gt; When we are going to sleep, what
[2:25:34] happened to you?
[2:25:35] [Music]
[2:25:38] And and then when it's day, when it's
[2:25:40] day, when it's day, what is day now for
[2:25:43] you?
[2:25:44] &gt;&gt; They did change anything.
[2:25:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:25:47] &gt;&gt; Did you say that because it's night, I'm
[2:25:49] not going to get a paycheck?
[2:25:53] &gt;&gt; So paycheck can come in the day
[2:25:55] &gt;&gt; and paycheck can come where?
[2:25:57] &gt;&gt; You did that naturally. You didn't care
[2:26:01] about the day and the night. But when it
[2:26:03] come to your spiritual work,
[2:26:07] &gt;&gt; when darkness come, you stop.
[2:26:13] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:26:14] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:26:16] &gt;&gt; Remember this. This is where we stop.
[2:26:20] &gt;&gt; I'm so happy to know this one thing,
[2:26:22] friend. That what?
[2:26:24] &gt;&gt; Christianity
[2:26:25] &gt;&gt; has what?
[2:26:26] &gt;&gt; No negative thing to it.
[2:26:28] [Music]
[2:26:29] Amen.
[2:26:30] &gt;&gt; It doesn't mean darkness is not there.
[2:26:33] &gt;&gt; But even if you see darkness,
[2:26:36] &gt;&gt; remind the darkness.
[2:26:40] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together.
[2:26:41] &gt;&gt; That in my life
[2:26:43] &gt;&gt; everything is positive.
[2:26:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:26:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:26:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:26:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:26:53] &gt;&gt; Let me start it again.
[2:26:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. If you meet day, you say good
[2:26:58] morning day.
[2:27:00] &gt;&gt; Good to be in my life.
[2:27:02] &gt;&gt; If you meet darkness, you say, "Oh, so
[2:27:05] you coming in my life. Good morning."
[2:27:09] &gt;&gt; Because you going to be changed in a
[2:27:10] day.
[2:27:12] &gt;&gt; Because you come to a point to you came
[2:27:15] to a channel where everything that come
[2:27:18] this way is always plus.
[2:27:22] &gt;&gt; That's why all things Work together.
[2:27:26] &gt;&gt; Work to get all things
[2:27:29] &gt;&gt; not something. All things
[2:27:31] &gt;&gt; in your life work together for what?
[2:27:34] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:27:36] &gt;&gt; Brother say you remember that
[2:27:38] Christianity has what?
[2:27:40] &gt;&gt; No negative nothing to it.
[2:27:41] &gt;&gt; It's everything absolutely how
[2:27:44] &gt;&gt; positive.
[2:27:45] &gt;&gt; A man that become a child of God has a
[2:27:48] what?
[2:27:48] &gt;&gt; A positive hold on Calvary.
[2:27:50] &gt;&gt; And Calvary has a what?
[2:27:51] &gt;&gt; A positive hold on him. H with the
[2:27:54] assurance by who?
[2:27:55] &gt;&gt; Almighty God.
[2:27:56] &gt;&gt; By enough by himself
[2:27:59] &gt;&gt; that he will raise him up where
[2:28:01] &gt;&gt; in the last days
[2:28:02] &gt;&gt; and take him where?
[2:28:03] &gt;&gt; To glory.

[2:28:08] &gt;&gt; It's something that is how
[2:28:10] &gt;&gt; positive.
[2:28:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:28:13] &gt;&gt; Brother Steven, I'm going through trial.
[2:28:15] It's positive.
[2:28:18] &gt;&gt; I am sick. It's positive.
[2:28:21] &gt;&gt; I don't have money. It's positive.
[2:28:24] &gt;&gt; Because it's an opportunity for God to
[2:28:26] show his power.
[2:28:28] &gt;&gt; So it's positive.
[2:28:33] &gt;&gt; Let's continue. My friend, brother
[2:28:34] Brandham say he was wounded for what?
[2:28:36] &gt;&gt; Our transgression.
[2:28:37] &gt;&gt; Bruised for our what?
[2:28:38] &gt;&gt; Iniquity.
[2:28:39] &gt;&gt; Tastement of our peace was where?
[2:28:41] &gt;&gt; Upon him.
[2:28:42] &gt;&gt; With his trap, we were what?
[2:28:43] &gt;&gt; Healed.
[2:28:44] &gt;&gt; Everything is how?
[2:28:45] &gt;&gt; Past tense.
[2:28:46] &gt;&gt; There is no negative at all in
[2:28:49] Christianity. It is all water
[2:28:51] &gt;&gt; positive
[2:28:52] &gt;&gt; water
[2:28:53] &gt;&gt; done paid for.
[2:28:54] &gt;&gt; It is how

[2:29:04] &gt;&gt; upon the people it's not a problem.
[2:29:09] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:29:11] &gt;&gt; That's why brother says this. Now it is
[2:29:14] strange thing that this is so much
[2:29:17] thought of people. They say well I am

[2:30:57] &gt;&gt; Green pasture. through the valley of the
[2:30:59] shadow of death.

[2:31:24] &gt;&gt; How?
[2:31:25] &gt;&gt; With all my heart. Let your testimony
[2:31:28] always and your thoughts everything
[2:31:31] never permit a what?
[2:31:33] &gt;&gt; A negative thought
[2:31:34] &gt;&gt; to come where
[2:31:35] &gt;&gt; in your mind.
[2:31:36] &gt;&gt; If you can help it when it start what do
[2:31:38] you do?
[2:31:38] &gt;&gt; Don't entertain it.
[2:31:41] [Applause]

[2:31:45] &gt;&gt; don't say it.
[2:31:50] &gt;&gt; You didn't get me. If you wake up in the
[2:31:52] morning you don't feel like it. Don't
[2:31:55] say it.
[2:32:00] How do you feel? I'm feeling good.

[2:32:32] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:32:34] &gt;&gt; Listen to this my friend.
[2:32:36] &gt;&gt; Listen to this my friend. We talked
[2:32:38] about the seven seal.
[2:32:40] &gt;&gt; We said the seven seal when he broke
[2:32:43] what happened?
[2:32:45] What happened? There was a losing of
[2:32:47] what?
[2:32:48] &gt;&gt; Elesia. A demonic spirit
[2:32:50] &gt;&gt; that came under the seven se and did
[2:32:53] what? Darkening the church.
[2:32:55] &gt;&gt; That was one side.
[2:32:57] &gt;&gt; That was one side.
[2:32:59] &gt;&gt; Is correct.
[2:33:00] &gt;&gt; That was one side. Are we together?
[2:33:03] Let's turn to the other side.
[2:33:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:33:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:33:07] &gt;&gt; Because when hell broke loose,
[2:33:11] &gt;&gt; heaven also broke loose.
[2:33:16] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:33:18] Are we together?
[2:33:20] &gt;&gt; Are we together? When the seven gallles
[2:33:24] spirit went, but that was not for me.
[2:33:30] &gt;&gt; That was to darken the church,
[2:33:32] &gt;&gt; not the bride.
[2:33:36] [Applause]
[2:33:38] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:33:39] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:33:39] &gt;&gt; Are we together? What happened in my
[2:33:42] side? In the other side of darkness,
[2:33:45] &gt;&gt; what is happening with the same seal?
[2:33:49] Are we together? If you fool, you tell
[2:33:51] me.
[2:33:51] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[2:33:52] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham say when the seventh
[2:33:54] seal is what?
[2:33:55] &gt;&gt; Broken.
[2:33:56] &gt;&gt; The mystery of God
[2:34:00] &gt;&gt; the water
[2:34:01] &gt;&gt; seal
[2:34:01] &gt;&gt; in this water
[2:34:03] &gt;&gt; mysterious seal
[2:34:04] &gt;&gt; is how
[2:34:04] &gt;&gt; finished
[2:34:05] &gt;&gt; until the day that seal is broke.
[2:34:08] &gt;&gt; And then it reveal what
[2:34:10] &gt;&gt; what's on the inside of it. The breaking
[2:34:12] of the seven seal
[2:34:14] &gt;&gt; make me understand who my maker is.
[2:34:20] &gt;&gt; That's why every day you begin to
[2:34:21] understand him more and more.
[2:34:24] &gt;&gt; You begin to have a not just today you
[2:34:27] are believing the message but the way
[2:34:29] you believing now
[2:34:32] &gt;&gt; when you say amen you're saying a man
[2:34:34] with understanding
[2:34:36] &gt;&gt; of who I am.
[2:34:40] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Amen.
[2:34:42] &gt;&gt; Brother say in the seed shall not air
[2:34:44] with the sh. Say notice but at the
[2:34:46] opening of water
[2:34:47] &gt;&gt; the seven seals
[2:34:48] &gt;&gt; revelation water
[2:34:50] &gt;&gt; 10
[2:34:50] &gt;&gt; the what
[2:34:51] &gt;&gt; the full word
[2:34:52] &gt;&gt; is what
[2:34:52] &gt;&gt; to be born into manifestation again
[2:34:55] &gt;&gt; and vindicated by what
[2:34:56] &gt;&gt; the spirit of God
[2:34:57] &gt;&gt; in how
[2:34:58] &gt;&gt; in the full strength
[2:34:59] &gt;&gt; as he was here as he was when he was
[2:35:02] where
[2:35:02] &gt;&gt; here on earth
[2:35:03] &gt;&gt; manifested how
[2:35:04] &gt;&gt; in the same way
[2:35:05] &gt;&gt; doing what?
[2:35:06] &gt;&gt; The same things
[2:35:07] &gt;&gt; that he did when he was here where
[2:35:09] &gt;&gt; on earth.
[2:35:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hebrew 13:8 which say what
[2:35:13] &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today
[2:35:15] and forever. So when the seven seal is
[2:35:18] breaking
[2:35:20] &gt;&gt; to the people of the earth there the a
[2:35:23] demon goes there
[2:35:26] &gt;&gt; but to us Christ come down
[2:35:31] &gt;&gt; that's why they say rise and shine
[2:35:34] &gt;&gt; Christ is coming down
[2:35:36] &gt;&gt; and the word is born again
[2:35:38] [Applause]
[2:35:42] &gt;&gt; let's continue my friend listen to this
[2:35:44] brother Brandham
[2:35:46] Angels are doing what?
[2:35:47] &gt;&gt; Appear in the end times.
[2:35:49] &gt;&gt; All the prophet and the son did what?
[2:35:52] &gt;&gt; Post.
[2:35:53] &gt;&gt; Post point to in what?
[2:35:55] &gt;&gt; This day
[2:35:56] &gt;&gt; the that angel will do what?
[2:35:57] &gt;&gt; Appear.
[2:35:58] &gt;&gt; Prophet will do what?
[2:35:59] &gt;&gt; Arise.
[2:36:00] &gt;&gt; Son and what
[2:36:01] &gt;&gt; and wonders.
[2:36:01] &gt;&gt; If God did that for those little
[2:36:04] junction back there,
[2:36:05] &gt;&gt; what will he do now? When all hell is
[2:36:08] what?
[2:36:09] &gt;&gt; Turned loose.
[2:36:10] &gt;&gt; All heaven will also do what?
[2:36:12] &gt;&gt; Turned loose.
[2:36:13] &gt;&gt; And what will happen? Angels appearing
[2:36:15] &gt;&gt; and what
[2:36:16] &gt;&gt; signs and wonders on the earth
[2:36:18] &gt;&gt; on the earth.
[2:36:18] &gt;&gt; The counter faith is what
[2:36:20] &gt;&gt; are rising.
[2:36:21] &gt;&gt; God is proving who which is what
[2:36:23] &gt;&gt; right and wrong.
[2:36:24] &gt;&gt; So God is also pouring out himself.
[2:36:31] [Applause]
[2:36:35] &gt;&gt; The seals break
[2:36:37] &gt;&gt; depending on which side you are.
[2:36:40] &gt;&gt; If you are in Koshed or in Egypt. In
[2:36:43] Egypt, a demon goes there.
[2:36:45] &gt;&gt; In go the anointing of God dropped
[2:36:48] there.
[2:36:48] &gt;&gt; Because when hell is broke loose,
[2:36:51] &gt;&gt; heaven also break loose.
[2:36:53] &gt;&gt; Because both of those forces must meet
[2:36:55] together.
[2:36:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:36:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:36:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.

[2:42:33] &gt;&gt; history? I don't know if I would have
[2:42:36] had a say so before the foundation of
[2:42:39] the world and if God would have laid out
[2:42:42] the whole program to me and say to me, I
[2:42:45] want you to preach and now what age do
[2:42:48] you desire
[2:42:50] &gt;&gt; to go to the earth to preach? I would
[2:42:53] have chosen this age.
[2:42:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[2:42:57] &gt;&gt; For I think this is a
[2:42:59] &gt;&gt; the golden age.
[2:43:03] &gt;&gt; Gross darkness upon the people.
[2:43:05] &gt;&gt; And you calling that again what?
[2:43:08] &gt;&gt; The worst age of all. And it become the
[2:43:11] most glorious one.
[2:43:12] &gt;&gt; Where are you at?
[2:43:17] The darkness doesn't mean anything
[2:43:20] &gt;&gt; compared to the glory that is revealed
[2:43:23] in that day.
[2:43:25] &gt;&gt; Are we together, brother? Brother say, I
[2:43:27] certainly would have loved to have been
[2:43:30] here during the time of his visit to the
[2:43:33] earth.
[2:43:36] &gt;&gt; I'm going to read it again. Brother
[2:43:38] Brham say I certainly would have loved
[2:43:41] to have been here during the time of his
[2:43:43] visit where
[2:43:44] &gt;&gt; to the earth.
[2:43:47] &gt;&gt; All of us here if we say when Jesus was
[2:43:49] in Palestine
[2:43:50] &gt;&gt; do you want to have been there
[2:43:52] &gt;&gt; everybody would have say yes
[2:43:54] &gt;&gt; but listen to brother
[2:44:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother, brother say I think but
[2:44:03] still
[2:44:04] &gt;&gt; I think this right now
[2:44:07] &gt;&gt; is a greater time.
[2:44:12] [Applause]
[2:44:14] &gt;&gt; I don't know if we together
[2:44:16] &gt;&gt; when he was here on earth.
[2:44:19] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[2:44:19] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:44:20] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:44:22] &gt;&gt; He says the work that you shall do
[2:44:26] &gt;&gt; will be how?
[2:44:28] So which which time do you want to come
[2:44:31] when he was here or after him?
[2:44:33] &gt;&gt; Because after him is when greater is
[2:44:38] &gt;&gt; because at the cross he say it's
[2:44:41] finished.
[2:44:42] &gt;&gt; We need to define what was finished.
[2:44:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:44:47] &gt;&gt; It's not your finish.
[2:44:49] &gt;&gt; It was finished the work of redemption.
[2:44:53] &gt;&gt; But there were things he left.
[2:44:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:45:00] Brother, don't worry about it. Let's go
[2:45:02] here. Brother Brandham say, I think this
[2:45:04] right now is a greater time because it's
[2:45:07] the a time that he's coming to take what
[2:45:10] &gt;&gt; the people that he's redeemed
[2:45:12] &gt;&gt; nearing the water
[2:45:14] &gt;&gt; resurrection
[2:45:15] &gt;&gt; when all redeemed will do what?
[2:45:17] &gt;&gt; Come forth.
[2:45:17] &gt;&gt; What a glorious water
[2:45:19] &gt;&gt; opportunity we have
[2:45:21] &gt;&gt; to speak to a dying people.
[2:45:24] &gt;&gt; Great time. We are enthused about it.
[2:45:27] &gt;&gt; Enthused about it.
[2:45:28] &gt;&gt; Enthused about it.
[2:45:30] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says this. He says, "Oh
[2:45:32] Christian, what opportunity we have?
[2:45:37] &gt;&gt; We have what
[2:45:38] &gt;&gt; opportunities
[2:45:39] &gt;&gt; that who?"
[2:45:40] &gt;&gt; St. Paul never dreamed of having.
[2:45:45] &gt;&gt; We have opportunity that who
[2:45:47] &gt;&gt; Enoch.
[2:45:49] &gt;&gt; And who?
[2:45:50] &gt;&gt; Elijah.
[2:45:51] &gt;&gt; And who? All of them never had
[2:45:53] &gt;&gt; the opportunity we have
[2:45:55] &gt;&gt; now.
[2:45:57] [Applause]
[2:45:58] This opportunity is greater than Paul
[2:46:01] &gt;&gt; is greater than all of them.
[2:46:08] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:46:10] &gt;&gt; Are we together? That's why brother say
[2:46:13] if we can focus ourself to what
[2:46:16] &gt;&gt; the plan of God
[2:46:17] &gt;&gt; to what God wants for us
[2:46:20] &gt;&gt; and what God did what
[2:46:21] &gt;&gt; promised us
[2:46:22] &gt;&gt; and let everything else how
[2:46:24] &gt;&gt; alone
[2:46:27] &gt;&gt; focus to the plan of God
[2:46:30] &gt;&gt; don't focus on CNN
[2:46:32] &gt;&gt; NBC Fox News leave those alone
[2:46:34] &gt;&gt; that's another side of
[2:46:38] &gt;&gt; focus in go
[2:46:40] &gt;&gt; Amen Amen.
[2:46:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:46:44] &gt;&gt; Focus to the plan of God
[2:46:46] &gt;&gt; and focus to what God want for us
[2:46:50] &gt;&gt; and what God did what
[2:46:51] &gt;&gt; promised us
[2:46:52] &gt;&gt; and let everything else how
[2:46:54] &gt;&gt; alone.
[2:46:54] &gt;&gt; No matter how long it is just keep on
[2:46:58] doing
[2:46:58] &gt;&gt; believing.
[2:47:01] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:47:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:47:02] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:47:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:47:03] &gt;&gt; Don't worry flat at 10 and prepare for
[2:47:05] landing. And that day, in that day, the
[2:47:09] great anointed church
[2:47:11] &gt;&gt; was to rise to her what
[2:47:14] &gt;&gt; power.
[2:47:14] &gt;&gt; Jesus was to do what?
[2:47:16] &gt;&gt; Come in.
[2:47:17] &gt;&gt; When the enemy come in like a what?
[2:47:19] &gt;&gt; A flood.
[2:47:20] &gt;&gt; The spirit of the Lord does what?
[2:47:22] &gt;&gt; Raises up a standard against it.
[2:47:23] &gt;&gt; And today when science is doing all the
[2:47:26] different thing, then God is sending
[2:47:29] down what?
[2:47:30] &gt;&gt; Supernatural signs
[2:47:31] &gt;&gt; to show to who?
[2:47:32] &gt;&gt; His church. Take your mind off the
[2:47:34] things of the word and do what?
[2:47:37] &gt;&gt; Look up.
[2:47:38] [Applause]
[2:47:43] &gt;&gt; Look up. We are in the what?
[2:47:45] &gt;&gt; Ladder. Now
[2:47:45] &gt;&gt; you are anchored both in what?
[2:47:47] &gt;&gt; In glory.
[2:47:49] &gt;&gt; And in
[2:47:50] &gt;&gt; heaven.
[2:47:52] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together.
[2:47:54] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together.
[2:47:57] &gt;&gt; Get your mind off what is going on in
[2:47:59] the world.
[2:48:02] Don't leave. Don't look at what is in
[2:48:04] Egypt.
[2:48:05] &gt;&gt; Listen to Moses.
[2:48:08] [Music]
[2:48:09] &gt;&gt; Moses will give you the instruction of
[2:48:12] the hour for you to get your blessing.
[2:48:18] &gt;&gt; Don't listen to Jen and Jim.
[2:48:24] &gt;&gt; Don't listen to Pentecost now.
[2:48:28] &gt;&gt; They don't know how to define this age.
[2:48:32] Amen.
[2:48:35] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:48:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:48:37] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:48:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:48:38] &gt;&gt; Brother, brother, say, and people act
[2:48:40] how
[2:48:41] &gt;&gt; funny.
[2:48:41] &gt;&gt; They seems to just forget about the
[2:48:43] negative side.
[2:48:50] &gt;&gt; He's so funny.
[2:48:52] &gt;&gt; You acting like you don't live in this
[2:48:54] world.
[2:48:55] &gt;&gt; It looks like you have forgotten what is
[2:48:57] going on around. You living like there
[2:49:00] is nothing bad.
[2:49:02] &gt;&gt; No, it depends on what you watch on
[2:49:04] YouTube.
[2:49:07] [Applause]
[2:49:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:49:12] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:49:13] &gt;&gt; I'm not in the world over there.
[2:49:15] &gt;&gt; You the one watching shooting.
[2:49:18] &gt;&gt; You the one watching murdering.
[2:49:20] &gt;&gt; You the one watching all about Charlie
[2:49:22] Kirk.
[2:49:24] &gt;&gt; Me. I have William Marion brother.
[2:49:26] &gt;&gt; I'm focusing on something else.
[2:49:29] And because you watch too much of the
[2:49:31] outside, you are afraid.
[2:49:34] &gt;&gt; You are depressed. You don't have faith
[2:49:36] anymore.
[2:49:37] &gt;&gt; You know, we need to start storing
[2:49:39] things because they say the economy is
[2:49:42] going bad because you listening to that
[2:49:44] all the time.
[2:49:46] &gt;&gt; I don't need the economy.
[2:49:48] [Applause]
[2:49:52] &gt;&gt; Through the whole through the whole time
[2:49:55] of Biden, was the economy good?
[2:49:57] &gt;&gt; No. Did you live?
[2:49:58] &gt;&gt; No.
[2:49:59] &gt;&gt; Did you die?
[2:50:00] &gt;&gt; No.
[2:50:00] &gt;&gt; So why you keep worrying about economy?
[2:50:03] &gt;&gt; Before bad, the economy was not good all
[2:50:05] the time. The economy is not where he's
[2:50:07] supposed to be doing.
[2:50:10] &gt;&gt; Did he change your life?
[2:50:12] &gt;&gt; Did he forbid you for for driving a car
[2:50:15] for buying a house? So why you quit
[2:50:17] following the same clock?
[2:50:19] [Applause]
[2:50:21] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[2:50:23] &gt;&gt; did you hear what's going on on the
[2:50:24] news? Man, it's going bad. I don't know.
[2:50:27] We going through a depression. Things
[2:50:28] are going really, really bad.
[2:50:32] &gt;&gt; Yes, things are going really, really bad
[2:50:35] because of where you are tuned in.
[2:50:38] &gt;&gt; To me, it's a glorious time.
[2:50:41] &gt;&gt; Because America was already declared in
[2:50:44] 56 that there was no more redemption.
[2:50:47] So, I'm not depending on America. I'm
[2:50:49] depending on the one that came on Sunset
[2:50:51] Mountain.
[2:50:53] &gt;&gt; He is everything.
[2:51:00] Are we together?
[2:51:01] &gt;&gt; Brother say they act funny. They seems
[2:51:05] to have forgotten about what
[2:51:06] &gt;&gt; the negative side
[2:51:07] &gt;&gt; because they have found an absolute
[2:51:12] &gt;&gt; because it's what
[2:51:13] &gt;&gt; the word of God.
[2:51:14] &gt;&gt; So there is nothing else that I can look
[2:51:16] at.
[2:51:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[2:51:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:51:25] &gt;&gt; We act like we are depending completely
[2:51:28] in this civilization.
[2:51:30] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:51:32] &gt;&gt; But the people who find the absolute,
[2:51:35] &gt;&gt; I'm heading to the airport. The people
[2:51:37] who have found the absolute,
[2:51:39] &gt;&gt; amen, they don't look at the negative
[2:51:41] side anymore.
[2:51:43] &gt;&gt; Get on YouTube. You're going to mess
[2:51:45] your mind.
[2:51:49] &gt;&gt; Video all of them. Amen.
[2:51:52] &gt;&gt; 1.3 million view.
[2:51:54] &gt;&gt; Stupid stuff.
[2:51:57] &gt;&gt; Lying.
[2:51:58] &gt;&gt; They will put a thumbnail that will
[2:52:01] attract you. You click it, it's not
[2:52:02] there.
[2:52:09] &gt;&gt; Before you know it, you are confused.
[2:52:11] &gt;&gt; You don't even know who you are.
[2:52:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. You know more about the negative
[2:52:17] side of this country than how positive
[2:52:20] the word is to you.
[2:52:24] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:52:25] &gt;&gt; Brother said Jesus say what
[2:52:28] &gt;&gt; heavens and earth will pass away
[2:52:29] &gt;&gt; but my word will what
[2:52:31] &gt;&gt; shall never fail
[2:52:32] &gt;&gt; but my word shall never fail. So if they
[2:52:34] got the word of promise
[2:52:36] &gt;&gt; then there is what?
[2:52:38] &gt;&gt; No failing to it.
[2:52:39] &gt;&gt; Why?
[2:52:39] &gt;&gt; It cannot fail. So I'm believing that
[2:52:43] that is what the prayer meeting here
[2:52:45] &gt;&gt; the religious people of Houston are
[2:52:47] interested in human lives and that is
[2:52:50] what we are gathered here for is to call
[2:52:53] on a what
[2:52:54] &gt;&gt; a power
[2:52:54] &gt;&gt; that is how
[2:52:55] &gt;&gt; beyond all man-made laws and powers
[2:52:59] &gt;&gt; something who can change the what
[2:53:01] &gt;&gt; hearts of men
[2:53:02] &gt;&gt; like he did to what
[2:53:03] &gt;&gt; pharaoh and Egypt
[2:53:04] &gt;&gt; and he is what
[2:53:06] &gt;&gt; God
[2:53:06] &gt;&gt; and we must stop now
[2:53:10] &gt;&gt; tell your brother or your sister. We
[2:53:12] must stop now.
[2:53:15] &gt;&gt; We need to stop now. What?
[2:53:21] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:53:22] &gt;&gt; We must stop now what?
[2:53:25] &gt;&gt; Looking at the negative side.
[2:53:27] &gt;&gt; Looking at what?
[2:53:28] &gt;&gt; The negative side.
[2:53:29] &gt;&gt; And go to looking at the what?
[2:53:31] &gt;&gt; The positive side.
[2:53:37] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Are we together? Don't
[2:53:40] talk to me about what is on the street.
[2:53:42] Don't talk to me about the shooting in
[2:53:44] Gastonia, the murder that is happening
[2:53:47] over there. Talk to me about the
[2:53:49] testimony.
[2:53:51] &gt;&gt; What God did for you, did for this one,
[2:53:54] did for this one. Because that is giving
[2:53:56] me faith.
[2:53:58] &gt;&gt; It is boosting my faith to know that God
[2:54:01] is living in the midst of us.
[2:54:06] [Applause]
[2:54:10] Are we together?
[2:54:11] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:54:13] &gt;&gt; Who are you? A dispatcher of which news?
[2:54:18] &gt;&gt; They don't even pay you
[2:54:20] &gt;&gt; to report what you hear on the radio.
[2:54:23] &gt;&gt; But you are so faithful
[2:54:25] &gt;&gt; about what is going on in Africa, what
[2:54:27] is going on in Europe. You know
[2:54:28] everything,
[2:54:30] &gt;&gt; but you never finish the church ages.
[2:54:32] Put your head back to the church ages.
[2:54:38] Because you will miss the season.
[2:54:41] &gt;&gt; When it's dark, there is a season.
[2:54:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:54:48] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:54:50] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:54:51] &gt;&gt; What are you looking at in your life?
[2:54:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:54:54] &gt;&gt; What are you focusing on that drawn you
[2:54:56] all the time?
[2:54:59] &gt;&gt; Why are you so depressed?
[2:55:00] &gt;&gt; Why?
[2:55:03] because you're looking at something else
[2:55:05] &gt;&gt; that is not the word of God.
[2:55:07] &gt;&gt; You focus too much on the negative side
[2:55:10] of
[2:55:10] &gt;&gt; Laudisha
[2:55:14] &gt;&gt; versus looking at the positive side of
[2:55:16] Laudisha.
[2:55:18] &gt;&gt; The seven seal to you is not for the
[2:55:20] egistical spirit.
[2:55:22] &gt;&gt; It is God himself
[2:55:24] &gt;&gt; that has come down to meet you.
[2:55:29] &gt;&gt; That's the seven seal for me. The
[2:55:31] ecclesiastical spirit is for the pope,
[2:55:34] not me. To me, my husband has come. The
[2:55:37] revealed word of the hour has come to
[2:55:40] meet me.
[2:55:42] My light has come. The glory of the Lord
[2:55:45] has risen upon me. Talk to me about what
[2:55:48] is positive.
[2:55:52] And there is nothing positive by the
[2:55:54] word of God. That's why the Bible say be
[2:55:57] careful for nothing but in everything by
[2:56:00] prayer and supplication. Let your
[2:56:03] requests be made known unto who? And the
[2:56:06] peace of God, the shalom of God shall
[2:56:10] keep your heart and your mind in Jesus
[2:56:14] Christ. Let everything that is pure,
[2:56:17] honorable, just let that be the main
[2:56:20] thing of your meditation.
[2:56:23] Meditate on the positive because you are
[2:56:26] positive
[2:56:28] &gt;&gt; and this church is positive.
[2:56:31] [Music]
[2:56:34] &gt;&gt; Your confession positive, your walk
[2:56:37] positive, your jumping positive, your
[2:56:40] dancing positive,
[2:56:43] [Applause]
[2:56:45] &gt;&gt; my breathing positive,
[2:56:47] &gt;&gt; my eating is positive.
[2:56:51] [Applause]
[2:56:56] Are we together?
[2:56:58] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:57:00] &gt;&gt; Why do we miss season in the midst of
[2:57:02] darkness?
[2:57:04] &gt;&gt; Because we focus on the negative.
[2:57:11] &gt;&gt; Because of focusing on the negative,
[2:57:14] &gt;&gt; this is where the devil get you.
[2:57:17] He multiply trials
[2:57:20] &gt;&gt; and you focus on the trial
[2:57:22] &gt;&gt; and you become away from the real deal.
[2:57:26] &gt;&gt; When trial come it's nothing.
[2:57:30] &gt;&gt; Use that bring the master of the trial.
[2:57:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:57:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:57:38] &gt;&gt; God did not choose you to this age just
[2:57:40] like that.
[2:57:43] As much as you don't think you are who
[2:57:46] you are
[2:57:48] because some of us think especially
[2:57:49] sister they think because they don't
[2:57:50] preach you don't need to be preaching
[2:57:53] &gt;&gt; at Wright was not preaching
[2:57:57] &gt;&gt; ameny right was not a preacher
[2:58:00] &gt;&gt; ate right was not a deacon wife
[2:58:02] &gt;&gt; she was not a pastor wife
[2:58:04] &gt;&gt; she was just a simple poor woman
[2:58:07] &gt;&gt; that was sitting there
[2:58:08] &gt;&gt; but the third pull came to heral
[2:58:14] Are we together?
[2:58:15] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:58:17] &gt;&gt; Quit looking at what you're looking at.
[2:58:19] It's depressing.
[2:58:21] &gt;&gt; It's preparing people for tribulation.
[2:58:25] &gt;&gt; We are not preparing to stay in
[2:58:27] tribulation. We are going into another
[2:58:30] world.
[2:58:33] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Are we together? It's
[2:58:36] getting bad. It's getting bad. Did you
[2:58:37] hear? Leave it alone.
[2:58:39] &gt;&gt; Live your peaceful life. That's why
[2:58:42] people get in trouble, religious people,
[2:58:45] because they get in politics.
[2:58:47] [Applause]
[2:58:50] &gt;&gt; They get in politics instead of, in
[2:58:52] other words, stay in your lane.
[2:58:54] &gt;&gt; Let the devil in his lane, the devil is
[2:58:57] in lane, me and my lane. If the devil
[2:59:00] get in my lane, he trespass.
[2:59:05] &gt;&gt; He trespass in my lane.
[2:59:07] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:59:08] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Forget about what is
[2:59:10] going on. This is the most glorious time
[2:59:14] God have put you in and God put you
[2:59:16] there for a reason. In other words,
[2:59:18] there is no wickedness that can be done
[2:59:21] in this age that will shake your faith.
[2:59:25] [Music]
[2:59:26] [Applause]
[2:59:27] [Music]
[2:59:28] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:59:30] &gt;&gt; Are we together? When you see light,
[2:59:32] just know around the light
[2:59:34] &gt;&gt; there's what?
[2:59:36] &gt;&gt; When you click br.org, or just know
[2:59:39] which website will come around there.
[2:59:43] &gt;&gt; The darkness about belief, the sun and
[2:59:46] everything. They must be around.
[2:59:48] &gt;&gt; They must be around. If they're not
[2:59:50] there, the message is not true.
[2:59:52] &gt;&gt; It is them that vindicate the message.
[2:59:58] &gt;&gt; Because to know really that you believe
[3:00:00] God, you must believe him when it's
[3:00:01] hard.
[3:00:05] &gt;&gt; Not when everything is good. When
[3:00:07] everything is not good, that's when you
[3:00:10] believe it. And that was the bet between
[3:00:12] Satan and God in the life of Job.
[3:00:16] &gt;&gt; God want to prove the devil that even if
[3:00:20] you change the season,
[3:00:21] &gt;&gt; I will show you Job is different.
[3:00:25] &gt;&gt; Job doesn't care whether he's healthy or
[3:00:27] not.
[3:00:29] &gt;&gt; No matter which state you put job, Job
[3:00:31] is always sealed. You can put pressure
[3:00:34] on his children, pressure on his
[3:00:37] business, pressure on his wife, Job will
[3:00:40] wake up in the morning and say though he
[3:00:42] slay me, let her trust him. He said
[3:00:46] that's the caliber that I'm going to
[3:00:48] show you.
[3:00:49] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Stay ragged in your
[3:00:52] faith. Don't look at the negative. Focus
[3:00:56] on the positive.
[3:00:58] Nothing is negative in your life. God
[3:01:02] bless you. Let's stop here.
[3:01:17] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[3:01:19] &gt;&gt; Now we have clean up season. We have
[3:01:23] clean up season in the midst of
[3:01:25] darkness. In the midst of chaos, in the
[3:01:27] other side of darkness, now we like to
[3:01:30] give you instruction. What do you do now
[3:01:32] in season now?
[3:01:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:01:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:01:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:01:37] &gt;&gt; Never look at a battle.
[3:01:40] &gt;&gt; Look at what is behind the battle.
[3:01:43] &gt;&gt; Why am I going through this trial?
[3:01:45] &gt;&gt; Maybe it's just a time for a better job.
[3:01:52] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[3:01:53] &gt;&gt; Maybe it's a time your supervisor will
[3:01:55] know who you are. Amen.
[3:02:01] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[3:02:04] &gt;&gt; You would teach Elijah how to believe
[3:02:06] God.
[3:02:07] He doesn't have your testimony.
[3:02:10] &gt;&gt; You would teach brother Logos how to
[3:02:11] believe God. He saw his grade going up.
[3:02:14] &gt;&gt; You would teach Charles Muhammad how to
[3:02:16] see God. He saw his grade going up.
[3:02:19] &gt;&gt; Now when you say the God of Shadrach,
[3:02:21] Mishakgo,
[3:02:22] those boys will say, "Amen."
[3:02:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:02:28] Amen.
[3:02:29] &gt;&gt; The message is no longer just what they
[3:02:31] hear, what they live.
[3:02:34] &gt;&gt; Let's pray. Heavenly Father, Lord, we
[3:02:37] are approaching you humbly this
[3:02:38] afternoon. Father, thanking you for your
[3:02:41] grace, for your love, for your mercy,
[3:02:44] and for everything you have been doing
[3:02:46] for us.
[3:02:48] Father, there is no domain that the
[3:02:51] enemy has worked so hard
[3:02:54] 6,000 years ago upon the human being
[3:02:57] like the domain of trial, of darkness,
[3:03:01] depression, glooiness, dreadfulness,
[3:03:06] fear, anxiety, tension
[3:03:10] to confuse your children. But father,
[3:03:14] the time has come that you want us. No
[3:03:17] matter what is in front of us, whether
[3:03:20] it's light or whether it's darkness,
[3:03:23] it's all the same. In your sight and in
[3:03:26] our sight, Lord, we know Lord, Father,
[3:03:28] that we are the light. And where we
[3:03:31] going, we are shining, Lord.
[3:03:34] Father, I pray that you help the church
[3:03:38] from now on to look at everything in a
[3:03:42] positive way.
[3:03:44] Every trial in a positive way. any old
[3:03:48] mistakes that they have done that the
[3:03:52] devil keep bringing back to their memory
[3:03:56] to tell them so that they would live a
[3:03:59] life that I wish I wish I would have
[3:04:03] done that I wish if I if I didn't make
[3:04:08] this type of mistake may they understand
[3:04:11] today that all of it
[3:04:14] &gt;&gt; was working for a purpose
[3:04:17] Trying to go to the past, it's a waste
[3:04:19] of time. It's a depression.
[3:04:22] But let's look at the positive because
[3:04:25] in the midst of darkness,
[3:04:27] there is another side of it.
[3:04:30] &gt;&gt; There is a light shining somewhere.
[3:04:32] There is an anointing. There is a favor
[3:04:34] that has been displayed and dispatched
[3:04:37] to help your children
[3:04:39] &gt;&gt; to experience the supernatural like
[3:04:41] never before. Before we leave this
[3:04:44] world,
[3:04:45] &gt;&gt; we are not going to leave this world
[3:04:47] like people that are barely escaping.
[3:04:50] &gt;&gt; We are not going to leave this world
[3:04:52] like people that are rushing out for
[3:04:54] because they have been chased away by
[3:04:56] Satan. But we will leave this world as
[3:04:58] overcomers.
[3:05:00] &gt;&gt; People that stood the test that fought
[3:05:02] the good fight
[3:05:05] and that are going victoriously
[3:05:08] knowing that they have done what the
[3:05:10] master asked us to do. Father, may you
[3:05:12] help each one of us in our work. Lord,
[3:05:15] may you bless your children and give us
[3:05:17] travel mercy. And Father, we commit this
[3:05:20] home on homecoming week unto the hand.
[3:05:22] Lord, protect us. And Lord, vindicate
[3:05:24] your word more so that Lord, Father,
[3:05:27] your children can see your hand more and
[3:05:29] more in the name of Jesus Christ.
[3:05:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:05:34] Take whatever happened in your marriage
[3:05:37] &gt;&gt; before today, put it in your garbage
[3:05:40] can.
[3:05:43] &gt;&gt; All the mistake your husband did, all
[3:05:45] the mistake your wife did, all the
[3:05:47] mistake the children have done, put it
[3:05:49] in the garbage can.
[3:05:52] &gt;&gt; You are not a fruit of accident.
[3:05:55] &gt;&gt; You are a fruit of predestination.
[3:05:59] &gt;&gt; And you have you were chosen to live
[3:06:02] where you are. to live in the family you
[3:06:04] are.
[3:06:06] &gt;&gt; God could not have put you in a better
[3:06:08] family than where you are.
[3:06:11] &gt;&gt; So overcome the trial rather.
[3:06:13] [Music]
[3:06:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:06:22] &gt;&gt; God bless you. We love you.
[3:06:24] [Applause]
[3:06:33] Amen. And amen. Um, just a quick
[3:06:36] announcement. We have cho practice of
[3:06:38] the service. Amen.
[3:06:43] [Music]
[3:07:02] I left a barren land
[3:07:07] searching for rest.
[3:07:11] Stumbling round in amnesia,
[3:07:16] bitterness and distress. But then I met
[3:07:21] the kinsman redeemer
[3:07:23] who's called the mighty
[3:07:26] one. He took this old Moabitete from the
[3:07:31] field
[3:07:32] to bring me to his house.
[3:07:36] [Music]
[3:07:37] He said, "You're not my child.
[3:07:43] You are part of me and I'm not your
[3:07:57] [Music]
[3:08:01] me. You are a do my eyes
[3:08:07] you are the woman.
[3:08:10] You are my bride.
[3:08:13] [Music]
[3:08:19] I've responded to your call
[3:08:23] and you have covered me.
[3:08:27] Lord with eyes to face my shield.
[3:08:31] All the mysteries being revealed. And
[3:08:35] now I see who I am. And I lay claim to
[3:08:40] all that's mine. I'm the lamb's wife.
[3:08:47] I was born with the price.
[3:08:52] He said you're not my God. Oh, you are
[3:08:58] part of me and I
[3:09:03] you are at my
[3:09:08] you
[3:09:14] [Music]
[3:09:16] in my eyes. I love you to my world.
[3:09:22] You are my cry.
[3:09:27] Oh,
[3:09:29] [Music]
[3:09:31] when I look back and see
[3:09:35] how much praise and love you show me,
[3:09:39] Lord, it brings me to my knees.
[3:09:43] That you could even think about me when
[3:09:47] I'm in need. You're still Jehovah Gyro.
[3:09:51] I can feel the way here
[3:09:55] I stand on your word
[3:09:59] cuz you're more than able
[3:10:05] [Music]

[3:10:09] for you are part of me and I

[3:10:28] in my eyes and I love you. You are
[3:10:34] you are my ground.
[3:10:37] Let's sing it together, church.
[3:10:40] And so I'm casting all my care
[3:10:45] only on you, Lord.
[3:10:49] I know you love me.
[3:10:53] I know you love me, Lord. Redemption,
[3:11:02] master.
[3:11:09] and for restoration
[3:11:14] for redemption.
[3:11:17] That's what seven angels
[3:11:24] my redee
[3:11:27] is rising
[3:11:32] back for you.
[3:11:37] And so I'm casting on my

[3:11:50] I know you love me.

[3:12:37] dead. He's risen.
[3:12:42] is coming back for you. Hallelujah. My
[3:12:46] redeemer's no longer there.
[3:12:50] Oh, no longer there. He's risen.
[3:12:56] And he's coming back for you.

[3:13:15] I know you love me Lord.
[3:13:23] It's desperate
[3:13:26] for glory
[3:13:31] and for restoration
[3:13:35] for redemption.
[3:13:38] That's why seven angels
[3:13:45] my redeemer
[3:13:51] [Music]
[3:13:53] coming back for you.
[3:13:55] [Music]
[3:13:59] Beyond this flesh
[3:14:02] that you can see now.
[3:14:05] Beyond the weaknesses
[3:14:08] of this flesh, there is a connection
[3:14:13] invisible
[3:14:14] with Jesus Christ.
[3:14:19] I don't know how. I don't know why. I
[3:14:24] cannot explain
[3:14:26] the love of God to my soul. But down
[3:14:29] inside of me, when I hear the word, my
[3:14:34] heart says, "Amen."
[3:14:38] I say, "Amen." Oh, I don't know how. I
[3:14:43] don't know how. I don't know why. I
[3:14:48] cannot explain.
[3:14:50] I love my soul down inside of me. When I
[3:14:55] hear the word, my heart says,
[3:14:58] [Music]
[3:15:01] I say
[3:15:03] on the other,
[3:15:06] beyond this flesh
[3:15:09] that you can see,
[3:15:11] beyond our weaknesses,
[3:15:14] of this flesh, there is a connection
[3:15:18] invisible
[3:15:20] with Jesus Christ.
[3:15:24] And I don't know how. I don't know why.
[3:15:29] I cannot explain
[3:15:32] my soul down inside of me. When I hear
[3:15:37] the word
[3:15:40] amen.
[3:15:42] I said amen. Let's try a verse.
[3:15:49] Now he has said I will be perfect.
[3:15:53] with the virtues of Jesus Christ
[3:15:56] himself.
[3:15:58] But I look around, I see so much
[3:16:01] imperfections
[3:16:03] shown to me by the devil, my enemy
[3:16:07] trying to keep me sad and depressed.
[3:16:12] But I stand right up on my two feet.
[3:16:17] I look at him straight in the eye
[3:16:20] and I say, "I don't know how. I don't
[3:16:25] know why." I can understand
[3:16:29] the love of God to my soul down inside
[3:16:32] of me when I hear the word. My heart say
[3:16:40] I
[3:16:42] Oh, I don't know how. I don't know how.
[3:16:47] I don't know why. I cannot say
[3:16:52] love my soul. But down inside of me when
[3:16:56] I hear the word my heart.
[3:17:01] [Music]
[3:17:03] I said
[3:17:05] second verse.
[3:17:09] He had said I would be raptured
[3:17:14] to fly away in the sky
[3:17:18] and discover the seven dimension.
[3:17:23] I can feel the force of gravity
[3:17:27] trying to keep me down to this earth and
[3:17:32] keep me stuck in this realm.
[3:17:36] But I stand right up on my two feet.
[3:17:40] I let my hands shout in gravity. And I
[3:17:44] say I don't know how. I don't know why.
[3:17:50] I cannot explain
[3:17:52] the love of God in my soul. But down
[3:17:55] inside of me when I hear a word my heart
[3:18:00] says
[3:18:02] [Applause]
[3:18:03] I rejoice rejoice and say I know I don't
[3:18:09] know how I don't know why I can
[3:18:15] love my soul down inside of me when I
[3:18:20] hear this word my heart Amen.
[3:18:26] I say
[3:18:28] beyond this flesh. Yeah. Beyond this
[3:18:31] flesh
[3:18:33] can see now beyond all weaknesses of
[3:18:38] this flesh. There is a connection
[3:18:42] invisible
[3:18:44] with the other side.
[3:18:48] I don't know why
[3:18:53] there
[3:18:58] is when I hear the word my heart.
[3:19:08] Oh, I don't know how. I don't know how.
[3:19:13] I don't know why. I can say
[3:19:17] the love of God for my soul down inside
[3:19:21] of me. When I hear the word, my heart
[3:19:25] say
[3:19:30] rejoice with the music.
[3:19:33] [Music]
[3:19:44] [Music]
[3:19:49] I don't know how
[3:19:53] I don't know why
[3:20:01] I hear
[3:20:03] my heart.
[3:20:10] I don't know how. Heat. Heat.
[3:20:23] When I hear the word my heart
[3:20:27] [Music]
[3:20:30] [Applause]
[3:20:40] [Music]
[3:20:44] through revelation 107
[3:20:47] I'll make you
