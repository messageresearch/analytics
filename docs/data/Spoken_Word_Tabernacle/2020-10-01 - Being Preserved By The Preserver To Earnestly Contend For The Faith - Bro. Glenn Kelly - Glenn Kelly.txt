group i say that by love in revelation and i say that humbly but the lot has fell on me tonight so the devil is in trouble is that right because we know that the word of god is able to defeat the devil anywhere anytime and any place and whatever you're coming here for on tonight whatever you're being in trouble with on tonight god has come to set you free because we come to talk about jesus is that right jesus is that right he's the one that's to be lifted up he said when you see that they approach it it lifts up your head our head is jesus christ if i if i be lifted up from the earth all men shall be drawn unto me is that right yes the gospel has not come just to be preached with a letter the gospel has come to be preached with power and demonstration we'll see you on the night let's see who you are the war you're fighting the spiritual war and you are victorious and god has sent us a precious pastor who had waited for his time he sat in his position he waited humbly he was obedient but now he said what joshua my servant moses is dead as i was with moses i am with you via victorious is that right how we got word is that right because he told us the rumor was who malachi 4 luke 17 30 revelations ah hallelujah let's go to jews chapter one then we're going to go to uh acts chapter one so everyone that have jews we see a visitor here tonight we're glad to have you by god's grace mercy and those that are looking in we desire your prayers also we come here and and it's out here now it's a crucial hour we see the time is drawing near but lord have not forgot his precious bride [Music] amen i've got my new timer here so let us read all those that have jude say amen we'll read the first uh three verses it says jews the servant of jesus christ and brother of james to them that are sanctified by god the father and preserved in jesus christ and called let's go to acts chapter one we're going to come back to uh jude acts chapter 1 verse 8. once you have it say amen it says but ye shall receive power after that the holy ghost has come unto you and ye shall be witnesses unto me both in jerusalem and in all judea and samaria and to the utmost part of the earth you may be seated may the lord had a blessing to the reading of his word we go back to the book of jude and look at the verse two mercy unto you and peace and love be what multiply see that's a lesson by itself right there is that right and the third verse here's what we got he said beloved when i gave all diligence to write unto you of the common salvation it was needed for me to write unto you and exalt you that ye should earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered unto the saints now we want a little topic that we have on here tonight i'm just going to read some scriptures and get out of the way because you know sometimes when you're getting there you have all that studying and you run in here and you're running in your mind is just running but we're going to read these scriptures and lay it out and let god have his way and we're going to pound on the devil here tonight is that right now tonight a little topic is is that you're being preserved by the preserver to earnestly contend for the faith you are being preserved by the preserver to earnestly contend for this faith is that right because you look we can we can look at you too and close the book and just run and shout is that right hallelujah he's saying now look he said look at you verse one he said verse one to one he said the servant of jesus christ the brother of james to them that are what sanctified by who [Music] what are you worried about you have been sanctified you've been called by god you've been chosen by god you have been anointed by god to finish this work is that right i've been sanctified who god hallelujah look what he said by god the father and then what and preserved in jesus christ boy i'm telling you there's no condemnation who those that are in christ jesus but walk not after the flesh but after the spirit is that right huh we are supposed to be the most happiest people in the world in the land we cannot lose is that right we're just waiting to go home is that right let's look at this preserve first look at the greek definition of the preserved we want to look at this so we can lay you there a foundation it says is to keep in cause one preserve or to stand firmly on a thing it says it's it's we have let me read it to keep safe from injury harm destruction that's why the holy ghost was saying there about sunday morning it's time to come on up here is that right it's time to come on up hear them we're going to speak this word and you're going to see it if it's mixed with faith and love because this is a faith that's working by love is that right this is the hour here now is that right so we're moving forward when love is projected sovereign grace came in is that right that's why we got a testimony with brother maurice of mother why because he kept the faith he was obligated he kept god's commandments now he had money in the what in the heavenly bank is that right he had blessings in the heavenly bank is that right he said prove me ain't that what he said bring your tithe and office and prove me and she wrote blessing i have a blessing for you to wear in there we're at in a storehouse is that right where in the storehouse that's where your artillery is is that right huh i don't want to get ahead of myself hallelujah he said now look he says to keep alive intact or free from decay we're still talking about the greek definition of preserved it says something regarded as reserved for a certain person is that right only his bride is that right huh this is bride food right now look what he says he says to keep what you save from breaking down it says now it says to keep for special use he's kept us from is that right he's kept the foot special used he said but now here's where the little point i want to look at here and go into an area he says we have been called to serve legal rights on the devil and his kingdom and to take back what's ours we do not have to live below our standards god said no diseases or no sicknesses would come upon his children he said i will show that you are a special class of people you are different look what he says judy comes here to talk these things earnestly contending for the faith let's look at our first example with jesus continuing for the faith when jesus came contending for the faith he was prophesied over in isaac isaiah 9 6 a child shall be born a son shall be given he shall be called counselor the prince of peace the mighty god he shall have the government upon his shoulder that's why i said the last time when i was here with the government ah is that right and we've got the who the god watching over us the almighty god that have sent us here on a mission to earnestly contend forth his faith when jesus had came when jesus came here on the earth jesus came knowing that now he had to come what let's preach the gospel jesus said the spirit of the lord is upon me he had he has a near anointed me to preach the gospel and he will say i'll tell you what let's turn to luke 4 18. let's look at these scriptures then i i'm going to read to some of some of the quotes and things but let's get these scriptures laid out hallelujah luke chapter four when jesus came on this earth he was on he knew he was on a mission and god anointed jesus at 4 18. they have it say amen he said the spirit of the lord is upon me because he has anointed me to preach the gospel to who to the poor he had sent me he had did what said sent i mean he has ordered me he has ordered you to earnestly contend to the faith that's why you go over to job last time we just hit job 42-5 in that scripture there when he said that job heard him he said faith come by what hearing hearing the word of god he didn't have an ear he that had the faith let him hear what the spirit is saying unto the church so he's now and he's coming in that means you do not wait someone that hears the word of god and notice a commandment from god they do not wait to move into it they move into it is that right you've been sent by god he said man look he said he said to heal the brokenhearted see to preach deliverance to the captives and the recovering the sight of the blind to set at liberty them that are what bruised now he coming in when jesus came he not only spoke these things jesus came and performed them god performed them it wasn't christ it was god is that right jesus said i did nothing unless the father showed me is that right now each and every one of you the lord have showed us sunday morning that word the two speakers what a pencil is that right he told us is that right we do not have to bow down to anything of satan because we have been taught that the word of god mixed with love and faith can defeat the devil anywhere anytime on any ground no demon forces can stand before it is that right where are you coming in where have you seen someone last time coming to worship service they get slain in the worship service and you hear those demons crying out of the presence of the lord is that right they came in and you used to remember when that devil that was in that land he was trained up and trying to lunatic demon he was trying to take him out of his mind he was trying to destroy him but when jesus came on the scene he'd come to the devil a dog he's got understanding of the word he always wanted mercy he always wanted grace would you come and destroy us before our time that were you destroyed before our time he said he said let us go jesus said go is that right because those demons did what they recognized the presence of the lord when praises go up blessings come now at your lowest time if you want to shake the foundation when paul and then was in jail innocent at the lowest point and they threw him in jail for the name of jesus christ and that worked them on mercifully empowering them start singing praises to god start worshiping the god the foundation of the jail joke this is our hour the joy of the lord is our strength [Applause] [Music] when they came in they shook the jail [Music] we're talking about earnestly contending for the faith and when they laid there and the duke and the jail shook and when the jail or the foundation of the jail shook the jail shook open why was paul going in that jail they thought paul was sent in that jail because of what he did is that right no no no no no no god had a soul in that jail ah god had to get someone in there so when he went in there paul and him knew start singing praises when people see you being done wrong in the world when people seeing you being stepped on when you're seeing he's still being talked about and all they see you going about it saying he never failed me yet he never failed me yet jesus christ never failed me yet and everywhere i go i want the world to know see he coming in why because god had called us see a house of praise is that right we lifted him up we wasn't nothing we could be afraid of the adversary nothing we could be shaking up the adversary why because our savior who was delivering he loved me died and he saved me buried he carried my sins far away rising he justified freely forever see god has given us what justification sanctification your visitors that's out there you know we got justification sanctification and the baptism of the holy ghost you too a believer a true believer justification means we never done it is that right we've never done it what can wash away my sins nothing but the blood of jesus what can make me whole again nothing but the blood of jesus people are feeling the guilt people are feeling condemned why are you you're now in what christ jesus now we walk not after the flesh but after the spirit is that right we're talking about first jesus christ came doing nothing but good telling them about the good tidings is that right that's why they come over here god sent us to live what a respectable life and we got justification now when you're justified then you're what's sanctified right sanctified by the washing of the water of the word pray and read your bible we're talking about women's souls what the lord has given us now behind the sea this is bride food is that right we're but we're talking about this gospel we're talking about winning souls to the kingdom of god we're talking about you what you are earnestly contending for we are talking about what he saved your soul for we are talking about what he preserves you for we talking about what he saw you to do before the foundation of the we're world in charge on satan's kingdom somebody's bound up with drugs we're going to get him back someone has drinking we're going to get him back guys someone has a smoker we're going to get him back someone that's a lesbian you want to get them back god someone that's a homosexual we're going to get them back because jesus said i will not lose a one he came sanctified then he comes with what the baptism of the holy ghost is that right now once the holy ghost comes dead inside of you now he got something to work with so with me now he has something to work with so once the holy ghost did come maybe that desire for you to go look at pornography now you got a power inside of you to resist the devil is that right he will flee from you in the long run now when the devil tell you to go drink you got a power inside of you to resist the devil and he will flee from you let's keep it simple all these things out there in the world that our brothers and sisters are struggling with is that right was not moses who uh i mean last time i was here then i told you i was a protester wasn't peter a protester ah jesus said you're gonna jesus come around and came down for foot watching yeah when they come down for foot watching peter protested is that right but when soon as he turned around and said you have no part of me peter peter said not only in my hands and my feet everything is that right peter received the word because he was seated is that right it was a scene down in there and now in his hour here now we're receiving the word we're receiving the baptism of the holy ghost we are getting refillings by praying and reading our bible is that right when god coming in this hour here now wants to see the word come and it's watered by the spirit is that right now the spirit comes and bring that seed that's the life if there's no life in that seed it's not going to grow that's just the way it is we're moving into the blessing of predestination you'll see what the holy spirit is doing for us right now is that right unless you catch a hold of it you cannot be lost huh it's a beautiful walk in this hour here now the jesus came healing the sick raising the dead opening the eyes of the blind earnestly what contending to the faith for the for the faith that god has sent them to to to do hallelujah what he said jesus is our example christ came so that we may have life and have life more abundantly and when he came in he's teaching us he said he was our example in that beatitudes what he's dealing with those were blessings those were promises turn to matthew 5. they just came to me wasn't in there but um i i got to catch you i got to catch it when it come to me see they're coming in now and don't worry some of you settle down you're gonna hear something from the prophet i don't been around alone if you don't hear nothing someone you're getting a little shaky okay huh say how you get around this is that right yeah i'm hitting everything i'm gonna preach just like i preach when i'm out if i come up here and try to preach like anyone else i'm a hypocrite and i need the out been around see people misunderstand when you say things some of you are burned down because of things in your heart and you're still worrying about the ones that behind you don't have to worry let me show you something hold that right there turn to first samuel 16. hallelujah we're going to turn back to matthew 5. thank you jesus hallelujah everybody's okay now look what we got praise the lord first time you're 16. see the holy spirit told us oh brusty that's beautiful too the three anointings the three crowning on david first he was there for saul then he was there for judah and then god would have known him for the whole israel is that right ah hallelujah let's look at david when david was here now for saul anointed what he was preserved for he represented and and the lord's said unto samuel he said how long without mourinho ah how long are you going to mourn for certain leaders how long are you going to keep doing it huh you don't have to worry about them with soul loss no press to the mark of the prize of the high calling everyone is not ordained for this rapture everyone is not is only the elected by predestination by for knowledge is that right look at david's position he says seeing i have rejected him from reigning over israel he says fill thy horn with oil and go and i will send thee to jesse the bethlehemite for i have provided me a king among among his sons he said now look at that for the sake of time drop down to verse six he says and it came to pass when when they had come that looked on elias and said surely the lord's anointing is before him he said but the lord said unto samuel look not on his what continents nor his height of his statue because i have refused him for the lord seeth not as man sees for man looketh on the what the outward appearance but the lord looketh on to the heart okay that's why the lord put up on that boy's sunday right so as a man thinkers as he thinketh in his what heart it was three ways that the man could speak right he speak from his mouth is that right but the abundance of it comes from is what comes from his heart is that right that's why he says malachi 4 came to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children the message came to change what our hearts and bring him back and make christ preeminence make christ the word make the word first in your life that's why he was telling them go up into jerusalem and wait until you're endured with what power up on high with that waiting until the what until the holy ghost come you cannot be a witness unto me until jerusalem until all samaria but the utmost part of the earth until the holy ghost comes is that right you can't walk right you can't talk right you can't pray right you can't love right you can't sing right until the holy ghost comes that's what he's bringing us into now but look what he told him to tarry oh look at the grace that's been extended to us to us gentile dogs it says over in acts as peter spake these words the holy ghost fell right on them glory be the god all you have to do is receive it and you believe it is that right when understanding comes confidence comes confidence comes faith comes faith is a revelation and only god can give you a revelation what god has given us here now is revel is fresh hidden in manner hidden in the scriptures do i understand all of it no but i believe it so when i go home i start digging too [Applause] he said look he says verse eight he said then jesse called abinada and made him pass before samuel and he said neither had the lord chosen this he said then jesse made shema to pass by and he said and he said neither had the lord chosen this he says again jesse married seven of his sons to pass before samuel and samuel said unto jesse the lord have not chosen thee and samuel said unto jesse are there all thy children and he said there remaineth yet who the youngest and behold the keepeth the sheep and samuel said unto jesse sin and fetch him for we will not sit down till he come hither that right he sent him and bought him and then now he was ready and with a beautiful countenance and goodly to look upon and and the lord said arise anoint him for this is he he said this samuel took the horn of the oil and anointed him in the midst of his brethren and the what the spirit of the law came upon david from that day forward so samuel rose up and went now verse 14 but the spirit of the lord departed from who saw and and an evil spirit from the lord troubled him and saul's servant said unto him behold now an evil spirit from god troubles thee let our lord now command thy servants with before thee to seek out a man who is a cunning player on an heart and it shall come to pass when the evil spirit from god is upon thee that he shall play with his hand and thou shall what be well now let's drop over to verse 20. verse 20 and jesse took it as the latin with bread and a bottle of wine and the kids sent them by david his son unto saul and david came to saul and stood before him and he loved him greatly and he became his his what he was his armor barrier god would use david as his as saul's on the barrier save it was at that time under that anointing god was using david to anoint him to be that armor barrier for his servant the anointed watch over the anointed touching out my anointing and doing my my service no harm is that what he told him i heard the holy ghost said all y'all out there that's throwing darts at this message you better be careful you better be careful let's turn the axe let me see the one we got let me see what wrote it down i've got x i think it's five acts chapter 5. i tell you when you come up on a minute you're like this i love it well it makes you think you got it you have to do some digging is that right you have to come on up here it's like going to two electronic schools is that right you to like trying to school to lose a two-year associate school is that right but if you go to georgia tech you gotta do a little more digging when you get to georgia tech is that right hallelujah this is the i elite it humbly because my lord is against satan and his kingdom because when you know that god have backed up his word when you know you're not coming to take no glory when you know it's all about jesus christ when you know it's about his people when you know us about his kingdom that's not my anointed word [Applause] they need to get that sorcery spirit off of them want to be something watch see what the word says hallelujah what did i say acts 5 acts chapter 5 and let's look in the verse uh let's start for the sake of time verse 30 uh verse yeah verse 33 verse 33 once you have it say amen he says when they heard that they were cut to their heart and took counsel to slay them he said then stood there up one in the council a pharisee's name who ah didn't saul sit up under gamilia they said a brother that teacher he was one of the greatest teachers in the land there's a doctor there at that time what makes you think that spirit disappears hallelujah he said i will send you apostle prophet pastor teacher and evangelist for what it's a ministry what was that ministry being preserved for for what for perfecting of the saints and the working of the ministry to edify edify the body of jesus christ they ask him for trouble you got to understand when jesus came into the land this was not like moses when acan brought them babylonian garments into the camp and the movement of god was on is that right the bible said his heart wasn't changed yet he coveted those things and when it was time for joshua to come in here he sent the ministry at him he sent the spirit at him he said bring him before us and he asked him was these things done say yeah and joshua did what not only killed him he killed him and his whole family every demon force that's come up in here is going to be exposed every devil that come up in here if your motive and objective is not for the word to be manifested to glorify god and his people be careful they take some of the things that they take some of the things that happen lightly hallelujah he said look see we came here we know we recognize we're in the war see when i'm going those prisons was in those jails you're dealing with all kind of demon forces he said they get to see many that come in my name you got murderers you got drug dealers you got child molesters you got feeling flammers you got all these in there but you got to love them because one of those seeds are going to come one of those seeds may be hidden up in what that role that road that god allowed them to play that seed may be hit up in there so only god can desert so the only thing can go down into a broken heart a broken heart is a crushed heart i want nothing but the gospel the gospel the good news and let a person know that judy come to set the captive freight see when they come in when a man locked up in there to be convicted see convicted to an inmate is not a good word you see what i'm saying but if he can catch the revelation once he's born again or the ordering of the spirit being convicted to a believer is a good thing so you got people that's there that god is using why they're locked up that's why when my son when he wasn't hearing you know and understand why my heart believed and i believe it when god opened back up again open them up abundantly lord because we're at the end so those souls that they can get to hear this gospel so they can hear this message i mean i can bring the books and the tapes and things in it but when i write them i say you write the voice to the voice of god according post office box 950 jeffersonville indiana 47181 is that right and they can get i said now i want you to remember is that right we're not part of the fanaticism but the word is real we got scriptures back and that is this so you bring them you have them away where they can get it you know testimony you know jeffersonville they're pushing out the tablet they're pushing the tablet out there now the agape tablet i think it is so they don't have the books for anyone anyone can't get the books anymore so i called the brother up there in jeffersonville i said brother i heard that we can't that we can't get any books anymore you're not printing any books he said how you doing brother kelly so fine he said oh he said that's for those just people sending them out to the public he said but we're only printing them in heaven for the inmates that are in prison and see what the lord has done he's going to get his word nothing can stop god's word from getting out there so we was there you know the last time we had a meeting with this gospel being preached you take a lot of fiery darts for this gospel oh i've been put out a few times too then they kind of joke at me and say you're the only one i haven't known been put out of a prison but let me tell you something but you have to understand is these religious demons that you're fighting up against has come to set them free so our last meeting we had 24 sold i'm not talking about decisions see when you're going in there they're getting decisions the nomination organizations are getting decisions nothing against the people the good people there but we're warned against the doctrine because it binds them up so where they do they get decisions we don't get decisions we get confessions you know you get confessions and and that brings them in now he said we believe in our heart and confess with thy mouth that was jesus christ has come and died on the cross and took away your sin and rose on the third day is that right we're coming and now preaching his gospel to set the captive free so we're coming in not just just letter only but to come in power and then demonstration the last meeting that we had and we got over there we were there in alabama in a prison preaching this gospel this end time message why because they never heard these type of words being brought to them again letting a man know no justification is past lutheran all they know is luther justification smoking a pipe is that right and you could drink beer they stopped there because they believed that was all right then we turned around but sanctification is that right wesley came is that right you're watching by the water by the blood or the water of the world then we came with what the baptism of the holy ghost you had some bound up with pentecost believing that speaking in tongues was the evidence of the holy ghost but god had a hidden nugget is that right he's bringing the word to manuka for serving us is that right some got the holy ghost and speaking tones but that was not the evidence because they still walk around living like the devil is that right appreciate me somebody they call a murderer somebody they call a drug dealer somebody they call a child molester someone they call a b e or house invasion artist someone you looked upon crying out broken and contrite spirits crying out for the lord because they can discern that the love that you have for them or last minute before they shut down the prisons 24 souls came repented that one that signed up for baptism in the name of jesus christ you're talking about somebody that's bound up only offer them notes now let god have his way he's talking about being preserved he's preserving us by the preserver we are attack we are attacking satan's kingdom is that right he said we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities and powers and wickedness and rulers in high places cast down every imagination that try to attack your mind is that right if it doesn't line up with the word of god cast it down he said about talking about what that is that virus what virus what virus you talking about huh that devil god told me no diseases he told me greater is he that is in me than he that is in the world you have to speak it by faith and watch god honors it huh your child you have the authority to turn the bird if god this is an individual walk god want to do that you got people that bound up by by the true baptism the revelation of the baptism is that right matthew 28 18 they say go hear all the world preach the gospel baptizing them teaching all nations baptizing them in the name of the father in the name of the son in the name of the holy ghost i asked him show me in the scriptures where anyone ever been baptized in titles father is a title huh son is a title ghost is the pronoun tied up he said jesus said he said in acts 2 38 he said i said repent and be baptized in the name of jesus the remission of thy sins and you shall ye shall receive the gift of the holy ghost it's a promise unto you and your children and those that are all called off you don't have to be backed down by nothing because you have been called you are being preserved by to tell them about this gospel [Applause] the name father is not a name son this is not a name he said go you all were baptized in the name in the name of jesus christ in thy name they said cast out devils is that right that's the only name a unsaved gentile is gonna answer to we're talking about being preserved to fight this war we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities and powers and wickedness and rulers in high places that's what the pastor verse steve was talking about when you get in that prayer closet you get down there and you start thanking him maybe you have a hard time breaking through we do then the last time we was here even brother branham said he had a time sometime he said but i what i pray the prayer of faith because the prayer of faith is the word of god and god will back his word in his time he said oh lord i thank you father just start thanking him thanking him for waking you up thank you for watching over you thanking him for saving your soul thank you for healing your body thank you for saving your father thank you for saving your mother before you know an anointing will come down on you and you will break through [Applause] we're talking about being preserved by the preserver god has chosen you and called you and anointed you look at david look what he says he says hallelujah i'm still at acts chapter five that's why i said you you need to be careful and those that are viewing it you need to be careful if you're kind of fussed and trying to fix a scheme and trying to deform god's word we get in another lesson next time in chapter 17 and show you why god sent this ministry that he sent here huh because the rumor ruined and the spirit of the joshua has to work together [Music] like he said it's over let me tell you something you got another fight the devil as soon as they say oh that's brother steve well that's what your pastor's saying you know what you look at him and say ah my bible tell me the hidden things belong to god ah once it's revealed it's mine [Applause] [Music] look what he says look at that alarm y'all help me lord he said now 33 he says when they heard that they cut was cut to their heart and took counsel to slay him then stood there up one in the council a pharisee's name gamilion a doctor of the law and a reputation among all the people chameleon was there we don't see him but i think simeon was his daddy simeon had him up in his buddhism is that right ah simeon was after a little more let us keep going he wasn't at the religion he was after salvation you ain't got to go in there when you go inside of there you fighting these demons of religion religion and salvation is two different things salvation only comes by jesus christ his blood that he shed for you and i on coward and in there taking our sins away telling them about the goodness of the lord get them in tell them about brother maurice's yeah you're going to hear somebody saying that tell me about brother roger who god is going to save his soul in him tell him tell them about the testimonies that come from out here tell them about the testimonies hallelujah they said now look he says in verse 35 and said unto them ye men of israel here you come are well reputed my reputation has a good reputation among those jews those pharisees he said then he said them ye men of israel take heed to yourselves what do you intend to do as touching these men for before these days rose up the theaters men boasting himself to be somebody to whom a number of men about 400 joined themselves who were slain and all as many obeyed him were what scattered and brought to naught as as this man rose up judas of galilee in the days of the taxing and drew away much people after him he also perished and all even as many as what obeyed him were dispersed don't take some of these things that's happened lightly god is in control he's a god he's a god of love he's a god of peace but he's also a god of war he said he said and now i say unto you refrain from these men and let them alone for if these counsel or this work be of men it will come to what no but if it be of god ye cannot overthrow it lest happily ye be found even to fight against who god hallelujah look at this time oh my my my come on up man come on up musicians let's see what's up lord god we're talking about earnestly contending for this faith we're talking about you being preserved by the preserver and david was hidden away and is being preserved for that for his time and now we are being hit he said i would have a a church without a spot or a blemish without such that's why you keep it here when the pastor said i'm not he's not having nothing coming in here mixing with what the wheat bread is that right because god has restored he promised in his word to restore and now he's preserving you and i and it was preserving you and i to stand on this precious gospel and this gospel you go in there you can go go back and read i'll tell you what let me look at this one point i said i want to keep my word let me read the truth this quote here so as you can see he said now look i got this from earnestly contending from the faith he said because that he eloquent men are great speakers no [Music] how do you know them we know that thou art a teacher that comes from god for no man can do these things that you do the miracles that you do except god be with you they knew that that was they knew that that was him but for their prejudice selfishness not ready to have self-denial to renounce your own surrounding and accept him you see what he was saying now when you come up under a ministry i'm not lifting up a man i'm talking about the man jesus christ i'm talking about what god is doing now some things that you maybe possibly saw or thought see he says what a godly sorrow bring a godly repentance that you don't have to repent of any longer why because you don't have to repent of it any longer because now you got the revelation the truth of the word and that light you're walking into it you no longer have to repent from it any longer so now you can say hallelujah now god has preserved this word to keep us god preserved joseph so that many souls can be saved is that right god has preserved us so many souls can be saved in this end time hallelujah give us a song brother abel then we'll pray hallelujah thank you jesus hello all is [Music] [Music] is alone [Music] is a place [Music] little bride [Applause] [Music] is

a prison that we don't want to be in but based off of predestination we're content we're happy we know there's nothing else out there for us you know the world's in ruins and we know that the only thing we have to hold to is the word even the word itself said heaven and earth pass away but his word never passed away so as we see his word continue to unfold and unfold we just want to place our stand on the word knowing that it will never pass away so we just thank the lord every sunday and wednesday coming here in this building and just speaking to us i'm thankful and i want to place my faith and trust in the word not in a man but in a word because we know the word will never fail so i'm happy to be a comic this evening i'm happy to be a convict of this message i know it won't lead
