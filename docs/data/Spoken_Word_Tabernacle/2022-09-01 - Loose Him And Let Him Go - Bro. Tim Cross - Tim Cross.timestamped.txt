[27:24] sends a Ministry in like this to just
[27:27] unfold the whole thing amen you get a
[27:29] full seven course meal amen and Saint
[27:32] John 11 beginning at verse number 32
[27:34] then when Mary was come where Jesus was
[27:38] and saw him she fell down at his feet
[27:41] saying unto him Lord if thou has been
[27:43] here my brother had not died
[27:46] when Jesus therefore saw her weeping and
[27:49] the Jews also weeping which came with
[27:52] her he groaned in the spirit and was
[27:54] troubled and said where have ye laid him
[27:58] they said unto him Lord come and see and
[28:01] Jesus wept then said the Jews behold how
[28:05] he loved him and some of them said could
[28:08] not this man which opened the eyes of
[28:11] the blind have caused that even this man
[28:13] should not have died Jesus therefore
[28:16] again groaning in himself cometh to the
[28:19] Grave it was a cave and a stone lay upon
[28:23] it Jesus said take ye away the stone
[28:27] Martha the sister of him that was dead
[28:30] saith unto him Lord by this time he
[28:33] stinketh for he hath been dead for days
[28:36] Jesus saith unto her said I not unto
[28:40] thee that if thou Arts believe thou
[28:43] should see the glory of God
[28:46] then they took away the Stone from the
[28:49] place where the dead was laid and Jesus
[28:51] lifted up his eyes and said father I
[28:54] thank thee that thou has heard me and I
[28:57] knew that thou heareth me always but
[29:00] because of the people which stand by I
[29:03] said it that they may believe that thou
[29:06] has sent me and when he had thus spoken
[29:09] he cried with a loud voice
[29:11] Lazarus come forth and he that was dead
[29:15] came forth bound hand and foot with
[29:18] grave clothes and his face was bound
[29:20] about with a napkin Jesus saith unto
[29:25] them loose him and let him go
[29:30] amen may the Lord bless the reading of
[29:32] his word and you can be seated tonight
[29:34] amen I want to take that for a title
[29:36] tonight loose him and let him go the
[29:41] prophet of God says in the message the
[29:43] Rapture preached in December the 4th
[29:46] 1965. the first thing is a trumpet
[29:51] and or a voice
[29:54] a shout and then a voice then a trumpet
[29:58] a shout a messenger getting the people
[30:02] ready the second is a voice of the
[30:05] Resurrection the same voice that loud
[30:08] voice in Saint John 11 that called
[30:11] Lazarus from the grave getting the bride
[30:14] together and then the resurrection of
[30:18] the Dead Sea to be called up with it now
[30:21] watch the three things take place the
[30:24] next is what was a trumpet a shout a
[30:26] voice of trumpet now the third thing is
[30:28] a trumpet which always at the Feast of
[30:30] trumpets is calling the people to the
[30:33] feast and that'll be the bride's supper
[30:36] the Lamb's supper with the bride in the
[30:40] sky see the first thing comes forth is
[30:44] his message
[30:47] his message calling the bride together
[30:50] the next thing is a resurrection of the
[30:53] sleeping bride the ones died back in the
[30:56] other ages they're called together and
[30:59] the trumpet the feast in the heavens in
[31:01] the sky why that's the thing that takes
[31:04] place friends we're right there ready
[31:07] now the only thing the church coming out
[31:10] has got to lay before the sun
[31:14] to ripen
[31:16] oh my so I like how the holy spirit is
[31:19] establishing the order of our departure
[31:22] or the order of the Rapture amen he does
[31:25] all three as he is descending it's his
[31:28] message it's his shout together his
[31:31] people on the Earth amen then to wake
[31:34] his sleeping body amen then to meet the
[31:37] Lord in the air to go into the the
[31:40] wedding suppery amen and then the
[31:42] millennial reign
[31:44] amen so I came across this article the
[31:47] other day uh just yesterday and I I
[31:50] guess it was just for you tonight
[31:52] and it's titled this are you held back
[31:56] by invisible shackles
[32:00] [Applause]
[32:02] [Music]
[32:04] Asian owner Asian elephant owners keep
[32:08] their elephants from wandering off
[32:11] by taking a small rope
[32:14] tying it to a wooden post and attaching
[32:17] it to the elephant's leg
[32:20] to the elephant the Rope is nothing more
[32:23] than a string
[32:24] one jerk and the Rope will snap one kick
[32:28] and the post will go flying yet with
[32:32] nothing but the small rope holding it
[32:35] back
[32:36] the elephant
[32:38] stays put
[32:39] how is that possible
[32:42] the answer is that it has little to do
[32:45] with the piece of rope around the
[32:48] elephant's ankle
[32:49] and everything to do with the invisible
[32:53] shackles
[32:55] around the elephant's mind
[32:59] the elephant is strong it's smart it
[33:04] holds incredible potential yet somehow
[33:07] is held back by nothing more than a
[33:11] piece of twine
[33:12] left almost powerless
[33:16] by a lie
[33:19] why doesn't she just break free the
[33:23] strength is there why doesn't she use it
[33:27] when the elephant is still young
[33:30] her owner takes her from her mother
[33:34] and shackles her to a large tree with a
[33:38] heavy chain around her leg
[33:41] for days and weeks the young elephant
[33:44] will strain and pull trying to be to
[33:48] break free but all she succeeds in doing
[33:53] is causing the shackle to cut deep into
[33:58] her leg
[33:59] eventually she gives up and accepts the
[34:04] idea that she can't go anywhere
[34:08] when there is something around her leg
[34:13] soon the owner can replace the tree with
[34:17] a post and the chain with a piece of
[34:20] twine
[34:22] once the elephant feels resistance
[34:27] she stops
[34:28] there's nothing but a piece of twine
[34:31] around her ankle but there are heavy
[34:35] shackles
[34:37] around her mind
[34:45] this is not an article about elephants
[34:49] this is an article about people
[34:54] who are held by something that is almost
[34:57] nothing
[34:58] [Music]
[35:00] but it triggers memories yeah
[35:03] it's something the devil has hooked into
[35:06] your life
[35:08] amen because it created a scar
[35:12] it created an indelible impression upon
[35:15] your mind amen it cannot be removed it
[35:18] seems it cannot be washed it cannot be
[35:21] erased amen so it's there as a
[35:24] tormenting reminder
[35:27] uh something that once held you captive
[35:31] amen and while it may not make you amen
[35:34] any less than a Christian or it cannot
[35:37] unchristianize you it cannot change your
[35:41] identity it can't change your origin as
[35:45] a child of God yet it hinders you from
[35:48] realizing your full potentially man and
[35:53] exercising the freedoms and Liberties
[35:56] that every son and daughter of God was
[36:00] born to enjoy foreign
[36:03] oh my
[36:07] God it says are you like that elephant
[36:09] you have the strength and potential to
[36:12] move forward but are held captive by a
[36:16] lie have you been conditioned to believe
[36:20] what its faults
[36:23] you watch people who are bound in
[36:25] systems you watch people amen it's it's
[36:29] like Stockholm Syndrome
[36:31] where they've been in prison so long
[36:33] they fall in love with the guards they
[36:36] fall in love with the captors they
[36:39] literally fall in love with the people
[36:41] who put them there
[36:43] and that don't just happen in prisons it
[36:45] happens in churches
[36:47] where people fall in love with the very
[36:49] Ministries that have bound to their
[36:52] faith amen by doubt and unbelief and by
[36:56] compromising on the word of God Amen and
[36:59] have attracted followers to themselves
[37:01] even by compromising on the word
[37:04] by writing permission slips where the
[37:07] word doesn't write them by giving people
[37:10] allowances and indulgences and welcoming
[37:13] them to the house of the Lord to the
[37:15] table of the Lord to the communion of
[37:18] the Lord and to The Fellowship of the
[37:20] Saints when their lives do not line up
[37:22] to the gospel
[37:24] that's not Freedom that's not Grace
[37:27] that's not Liberty that is bondage
[37:31] you're creating a prison house amen and
[37:34] you're calling in a church and you're
[37:36] calling it Liberty and you're calling it
[37:38] Grace but Grace Finds Its place in the
[37:42] word of God
[37:43] [Music]
[37:45] amen
[37:47] have you been conditioned to believe
[37:49] what is false
[37:51] or to stop
[37:54] when things feel hard
[37:59] amen let me translate this for you you
[38:03] let a traffic jam keep you out of church
[38:06] you let a dead car battery or a flat
[38:08] tire or a bad day on the job or a little
[38:11] argument with the wife you let something
[38:13] amen stop you just the least amount of
[38:18] resistance
[38:19] is all it takes Amen to stop you from
[38:23] being in the prophet of God said amen if
[38:26] the love of God is in your heart you can
[38:29] hardly wait for those Church doors to
[38:31] open
[38:32] [Applause]
[38:33] amen
[38:35] oh my or to miss out on your unique
[38:39] calling
[38:41] see the devil he cannot change your
[38:44] identity but he can marginalize your
[38:47] success or prosperity in Christ to come
[38:51] to your full adoption to come to your
[38:53] full placing amen and to exercise amen
[38:57] your privileges and Liberties as a child
[39:00] of God
[39:02] amen I don't know if I've said this here
[39:04] before but if we're not careful we're
[39:06] turning even so-called message Believers
[39:08] into modern Catholics
[39:11] in this day and hour we live amen
[39:14] people don't want to fast they don't
[39:18] want to pray they don't want to seek God
[39:20] Amen they want to attend church whenever
[39:23] it can fit on their calendar they want
[39:25] to pay their tithes and offerings amen
[39:28] and they want a holy man to do the
[39:30] praying to do the fasting to seek God
[39:33] Amen for every decision in their life
[39:35] including what kind of car to buy
[39:38] and we have enabled such a thing by the
[39:42] ministry giving that to the people
[39:44] saying I'll be your holy man I'll give
[39:47] you your indulgences I know of pastors
[39:49] that are permitted sisters to cut their
[39:51] hair
[39:52] nowhere in the word of God is such a
[39:55] thing amen but pastors have taken it
[39:58] upon themselves to become the standard
[40:01] as opposed to the word of God it's
[40:04] bondage friend
[40:06] it's bondage
[40:10] amen
[40:11] because if you're living in sin and
[40:14] you're living in a situation that the
[40:16] word of God condemns and that pastor
[40:18] says you're okay he just bound you to
[40:21] himself
[40:25] and when he goes off the word and
[40:27] everything starts to fall apart and
[40:29] everyone who's got the mind of God
[40:31] begins to leave that and find amen a
[40:34] church where they can be fed the pure
[40:35] unadulterated word you feel obligated
[40:39] to that man because he gave you a
[40:42] special permission slip
[40:45] that the word of God doesn't give
[40:46] they're binding disciples to themselves
[40:49] friend you say by the time we don't hear
[40:51] preaching like that well I'm just crazy
[40:53] enough to say it it's the truth amen
[40:55] it's one of the devil's tactics and we
[40:58] might as well say it for what it is
[41:01] oh he surely you won't die no surely you
[41:05] will God said you would and no devil no
[41:08] serpent is Gonna Change what the word of
[41:10] God said real freedom and real Liberty
[41:14] is thus saith the Lord
[41:17] say what the word says light up to the
[41:20] word of God God will give you Grace God
[41:23] will give you Mercy but to continue in
[41:26] sin
[41:29] God's not in that friend amen amen
[41:34] it's bondage
[41:37] it's bondage
[41:39] amen
[41:44] Luke chapter 19.
[41:46] verse 29.
[41:52] Luke 19 verse 29.
[41:54] and it came to pass
[41:57] when he was come nigh to bethphage and
[41:59] Bethany at the mount called the Mount of
[42:01] Olives
[42:02] he sent two of his disciples
[42:07] saying go ye into the village over
[42:09] against you in the which at your
[42:12] entering you shall find a coat tied
[42:15] where on yet never man sat
[42:20] loose him
[42:22] and bring him hither
[42:26] and if any man asks you
[42:31] why do you lose him thus shall you say
[42:35] unto him because the Lord hath need of
[42:41] him amen
[42:44] oh my and they that were sent went their
[42:48] way and found even as he had said unto
[42:50] them and as they were losing the coat
[42:53] the owners there I've said in the dim
[42:55] why Lucy the cult and they said the Lord
[43:00] had need of him
[43:02] this little cult
[43:05] is in so many ways like you and me
[43:12] and so many of God's children
[43:16] and Jesus commissioned his fivefold
[43:20] ministry
[43:23] they went at his behest brother Robert
[43:28] amen they were under a divine order
[43:32] they were under Divine instruction
[43:36] to go amen and liberate
[43:40] this little coach
[43:43] for a special purpose
[43:46] and Jesus could not fulfill prophecy
[43:52] he could not fulfill Isaiah's prophecy
[43:56] and the Old Testament scripture without
[44:00] the involvement and participation of
[44:04] this one little cult
[44:07] so he sent the ministry and he said
[44:10] you're going to find this elected
[44:12] predestinated cult but he's tied up

[48:33] breathing with the blood pulsating
[48:36] through his veins
[48:38] he had a temperature he had a blood
[48:41] pressure but he was wrapped
[48:44] he was wrapped in a garment
[48:48] that was fearing to a dead person
[48:51] but he wasn't a dead person
[48:53] he was a resurrected Son of God and he
[48:56] said it's time to lose him from the

[49:51] nobody had any hope for that nobody saw
[49:54] any worth nobody saw any value amen
[49:58] thought you were gonna be strapped and
[50:00] bound tied by a rope to the post for the
[50:03] rest of your life
[50:05] oh my
[50:07] but somebody spoke something
[50:11] somebody said something
[50:13] that said the fivefold ministry right

[50:41] the wheels of Prophecy have stopped
[50:45] until the five-fold ministry this every
[50:50] night out of the Rope
[50:52] and gets that little fella
[50:55] to The Voice
[50:58] Hallelujah
[50:59] you got a part to play in this friend
[51:01] the Rapture is not going without you the
[51:04] bride can't be perfected without you the
[51:06] sleeping Saints can't rise until you
[51:09] hear that voice
[51:12] and it strips away
[51:15] everything that has bound your faith
[51:22] amen
[51:24] Jesus needed a ride
[51:30] Jesus Needed Somebody
[51:33] to carry him
[51:35] down into Jerusalem oh
[51:40] Jesus Needed Somebody
[51:43] to carry the world's greatest religious
[51:46] heretic
[51:48] right down into the heart of the
[51:50] religious capital
[51:54] so a couple of hundred fanatics
[51:56] could strip the palm branches off the
[51:59] trees
[52:00] throw their clothes in the way
[52:03] and say our King
[52:05] is coming to set up his throne
[52:13] amen
[52:14] he ain't coming he's here
[52:18] [Music]
[52:22] he'd been on the earth for 33 years
[52:25] he'd been preaching for almost three and
[52:27] a half
[52:28] so it wasn't a man it wasn't his coming
[52:31] it was the recognition
[52:33] of his presence already in their midst
[52:38] Amen in the in the religious mainstream
[52:40] will call him a heretic called him a
[52:43] fanatic but to the elected predestinated
[52:46] that's our King
[52:49] that's our salvation
[52:51] that's our Redemption that's our healing
[52:55] that's our release
[52:59] from sins prison
[53:03] [Music]
[53:11] what is the attraction on the mountain
[53:15] prophecy becoming history
[53:19] God fulfilling his word
[53:23] largely unrecognized by the world and by
[53:28] the masses but to a few select Chosen
[53:32] predestinated and elected individuals
[53:36] this was the Fulfillment the wrapping up
[53:40] of that Old Testament
[53:42] dispensation and the introduction of the
[53:46] person Grace and Truth came by Jesus
[53:50] Christ
[53:52] praise the Lord
[53:55] oh my
[53:57] and It produced The Worship
[54:01] It produced joy
[54:03] unspeakable and full of Glory
[54:07] and that Pharisees said Master rebuke
[54:10] thy disciples and he said I'll tell you
[54:12] if these should hold their Stone if thee
[54:14] should hold their peace
[54:16] the stones would immediately cry out
[54:22] amen
[54:23] oh my
[54:28] future home of the Heavenly bridegroom
[54:30] and the Earthly bride
[54:31] now many of you want to put down this
[54:33] word this Greek word pass away brought
[54:36] that out of second Peter chapter 3.
[54:39] how is this world going to pass away
[54:43] and yet
[54:44] we're going to live on it
[54:48] how can the Earth be annihilated
[54:52] and still be a habitable place
[54:56] for God
[54:58] his bride
[55:00] and his kingdom to be established here
[55:04] on this same Earth well this all is a
[55:08] type
[55:10] and an illustration or a pre-figure
[55:13] of what happens to the individual
[55:16] [Music]
[55:19] The Voice
[55:21] of the master
[55:23] loses you
[55:27] annihilates
[55:30] the definition or the identification
[55:33] that once defined you
[55:36] and in the same vessel
[55:39] establishes the kingdom of God on the
[55:43] throne of your heart so his glory can be
[55:48] expressed
[55:49] through you
[55:53] amen
[55:56] if you'll notice some of you people that
[55:58] wants to put it down I'll spell it for
[56:00] you I couldn't pronounce it
[56:04] p-a-r-e-r-e-c-h-o-m-i-a I don't know how
[56:06] to pronounce it
[56:07] now the inspiration strikes me for
[56:10] something then I go back to find out the
[56:12] word now here I can't spell the word I
[56:16] can't pronounce it but in that the Lord
[56:18] is still give me away
[56:21] I go and find out what that means then I
[56:24] got it see then I got it again see
[56:27] heavens and earth will pass away
[56:30] this word means passing from one form
[56:38] to another
[56:41] home
[56:44] this Earthly shall take on the image
[56:48] of the Heavenly right this uh natural
[56:52] will give away the supernatural
[56:55] mortal mortality will give way to
[56:58] immortality
[57:01] bypassing death
[57:03] amen it's just like Jesus turned the
[57:05] water into wine
[57:07] brother Brown said that water would
[57:08] eventually become wine but would have
[57:10] had to come up through the Earth in the
[57:11] grave body to come out but it said Jesus
[57:13] bypass the process
[57:15] that's what happens at the translation
[57:19] because the penalty of death was settled
[57:23] there at Calvary the benefits of Calvary
[57:25] are realized and affected to the
[57:28] believer in this hour
[57:30] who has heard the same voice and that
[57:33] voice has a transformative effect on
[57:37] your life which is already begun
[57:41] when you heard the voice come out of her
[57:43] my people
[57:44] you left
[57:48] hey man oh my how'd he say it when you
[57:52] heard that eagle cry
[57:54] and you left
[57:56] that other thing
[57:58] you've heard from your theophany
[58:05] amen you've been changed into the very
[58:09] living image of the Living God
[58:11] amen this is not the words of a man his
[58:15] words will fail you're not feeding on a
[58:18] man you are feeding all the unfailing
[58:22] body word of the son of man
[58:25] okay
[58:27] praise God
[58:29] it's inevitable Rapture is inevitable
[58:33] translation is inevitable amen because
[58:36] the effect of the voice is irreversible
[58:40] and its effect in your life amen cannot
[58:44] in any way be disturbed by Satan
[58:48] [Applause]
[58:49] [Music]
[58:51] amen
[58:54] praise God
[58:55] [Applause]
[58:59] it means passing from one form to
[59:03] another it does not mean Annihilation as
[59:07] the English word would mean pass away
[59:09] it's annihilated but the Hebrew word or
[59:11] the Greek word there here does not mean
[59:14] pass away
[59:16] it means from passing from one thing
[59:20] to another
[59:22] friends to pass from one condition
[59:27] foreign
[59:29] how many of you does Satan try to defeat
[59:32] your faith
[59:33] based on your condition
[59:36] [Music]
[59:38] that's that twine
[59:40] that he wants to keep around your ankle
[59:44] to hold your spiritual mind
[59:48] from realizing a man that you are free
[59:52] from that
[59:56] he references
[59:58] Paul used it put it down you can read it
[1:00:00] later Titus 3 5 Paul is using the same
[1:00:03] word means the Regeneration of man
[1:00:06] that man has passed from a sinner to a
[1:00:10] saint
[1:00:12] not completely annihilated when a man is
[1:00:15] changed he isn't annihilated but he's a
[1:00:19] changed person
[1:00:21] he has been changed from what he was
[1:00:26] to what he is
[1:00:32] what gives you the right little cult
[1:00:36] to follow these ministers
[1:00:39] down the street
[1:00:41] away from your old identity
[1:00:44] I don't know
[1:00:46] it's something they say he said
[1:00:51] [Music]
[1:00:54] it's something they tell me
[1:00:57] said
[1:00:58] and evidently they believed it enough to
[1:01:01] put their lives on the line
[1:01:03] and keep working on that rope until
[1:01:06] every night was out
[1:01:07] hey I'm just following them
[1:01:11] to him
[1:01:14] amen
[1:01:16] I'm just following them to him and when
[1:01:21] I get to him he'll do with me whatever
[1:01:24] he wishes to if they want to put
[1:01:26] garments on me if they want to throw
[1:01:29] palm branches in my way if they want to
[1:01:31] shout if they want to scream if they
[1:01:34] want to break Church order whatever they

[1:21:56] God only wants to lose you into a
[1:22:00] certain area
[1:22:02] admitting doesn't mean so that you were
[1:22:05] not Christian
[1:22:08] do you hear me

[1:25:15] what you did in the past
[1:25:17] how you backslide in the past
[1:25:24] what does God want you to keep in memory
[1:25:27] why does God want you to keep in memory
[1:25:30] his word why
[1:25:33] what is the purpose of you keeping his
[1:25:35] word in memory
[1:25:37] why
[1:25:39] the greatest battle ever thought it's
[1:25:42] right here
[1:25:44] you gotta let things go
[1:25:47] if your mommy never treated your daddy
[1:25:50] good you cannot take that to your
[1:25:53] marriage
[1:25:57] you didn't get me
[1:25:59] if you never had a good childhood
[1:26:03] do you follow me because you were abused
[1:26:06] do you follow me because your daddy was
[1:26:09] a drunker brother branham's dad was a
[1:26:11] drunker what kind of home did Brother
[1:26:14] Branham came out of it how could he
[1:26:16] carry a message so sacred like this
[1:26:20] anybody okay
[1:26:22] don't make your children suffer because
[1:26:24] of you because you keep carrying that
[1:26:26] package
[1:26:29] from that time
[1:26:31] from today you can take a stand and say
[1:26:35] I don't want my children to experience
[1:26:37] what I experience I don't want it I
[1:26:40] don't want my husband to experience what
[1:26:42] I went through I don't want my wife to
[1:26:44] experience what I went through
[1:26:48] I want to change my life I want to break
[1:26:50] that Circle
[1:26:51] I want to be different than my
[1:26:54] biological family
[1:26:58] you are not here to keep caring the
[1:27:01] tradition of the family
[1:27:06] my father did this this is the way we
[1:27:08] are this is the way we so and so are
[1:27:10] this is the way our family behave
[1:27:15] we are not part of that family we are
[1:27:17] part of the family of God
[1:27:20] the name of our family is Jesus Christ
[1:27:25] body push break turn your engine off
[1:27:29] stop abusing
[1:27:34] whatever past you went through God
[1:27:37] allowed
[1:27:40] do you follow me do You Follow Me Maybe
[1:27:43] daddy left the mama God knew why daddy
[1:27:46] have to leave Mama for you
[1:27:50] do you follow me
[1:27:52] maybe you had to be taken to another
[1:27:54] home and be a foster child God knew why
[1:27:58] you must be because if you probably
[1:27:59] would not go that route you would not be
[1:28:01] in the message
[1:28:04] that's why the Bible say everything
[1:28:06] worked together for good
[1:28:09] no matter what path you coming up that's
[1:28:11] why we can say amen that's why we can
[1:28:13] sing Amazing Grace an angel cannot
[1:28:19] everybody here so don't take that
[1:28:21] childhood and then bring it there and
[1:28:24] make your wife suffer
[1:28:30] everybody okay
[1:28:31] everybody okay
[1:28:33] everybody okay
[1:28:39] I thought someone I say you marry a
[1:28:42] woman that didn't grow up with a father
[1:28:45] what do you expect from her what do you
[1:28:48] want her to do
[1:28:52] when you marry her you're not just that
[1:28:54] husband you have to be a father
[1:28:59] because now she's looking at you as a
[1:29:01] father
[1:29:02] so you are a brother
[1:29:04] you remember Solomon say my sister my
[1:29:07] spouse you are a brother then you are a
[1:29:10] husband then you must remember you must
[1:29:12] feel the void of a father
[1:29:21] because that's the way he grew up he's a
[1:29:24] victim of circumstances he didn't choose
[1:29:27] that that's the way it happened
[1:29:31] the Bible said that Isaac took Rebecca
[1:29:33] to his home and he was comforted of his
[1:29:37] mother Rebecca comforted Isaac for the
[1:29:41] lust of his mother
[1:29:43] do you know the scripture God verify the
[1:29:46] home so what what Comfort are you
[1:29:49] bringing are you the troublemaker
[1:29:53] anybody okay and you always nice when
[1:29:56] visitors are there
[1:29:57] because you have to show up that your
[1:29:59] message believer to the visitor
[1:30:02] as soon as the visitor leave back to Tom
[1:30:04] and Jerry
[1:30:08] but here another way to keep you sweet
[1:30:11] and home we need to get a brother and
[1:30:14] make him be a roommate in your house
[1:30:17] so well so your wife will breathe
[1:30:20] because every time you remember the
[1:30:22] brother is there you have to be heavily
[1:30:23] like a question
[1:30:25] [Music]
[1:30:28] [Laughter]
[1:30:30] but I can get to a deep surgery but I
[1:30:34] need to let you go home
[1:30:35] but you know what I'm talking about
[1:30:38] verse 2 by which also ye are saved
[1:30:43] if you keep in memory the things that
[1:30:47] the devil did to you
[1:30:54] I still can't take it I still can't
[1:30:57] every time I think about this thing I
[1:30:59] still not have realized yet in two years
[1:31:02] you still have now relaxed you're
[1:31:04] wasting your time dump it in the garbage
[1:31:06] can keep moving
[1:31:09] that person is living their life they
[1:31:12] don't care about you
[1:31:14] you're wasting your life
[1:31:16] wasting your time
[1:31:21] glory to God by which also you are saved
[1:31:24] if you keep in memory what I preach unto
[1:31:28] you unless
[1:31:34] I got that scripture sitting there
[1:31:37] unless
[1:31:39] you have believed in water so if you
[1:31:42] don't keep in memory you have believed
[1:31:45] in vain
[1:31:48] this is the scripture
[1:31:50] look at Paul can I continue he said for
[1:31:53] I have delivered unto you first
[1:31:56] first of all that which are also
[1:31:59] received it's not the message of Paul
[1:32:01] it's the message of God through Paul
[1:32:04] how that Christ die for our sins
[1:32:07] according to the water why does it start
[1:32:10] back on Calvary
[1:32:13] that's why he wipes everything
[1:32:16] that's what that's that's the starting
[1:32:18] point to wipe all your past
[1:32:24] how can you live in a marriage
[1:32:25] remembering the mistake you made in your
[1:32:28] childhood
[1:32:31] crying all the time
[1:32:34] because of a scar
[1:32:36] everybody here and that he was buried
[1:32:39] and that he rose again everybody okay
[1:32:43] the third day according to the scripture
[1:32:46] and that he was sin of cephas then of
[1:32:50] The Twelve after that he was seen of
[1:32:53] about 500 Brethren at once of whom the
[1:32:56] greater party remained unto this present
[1:32:58] but some are fallen asleep because the
[1:33:01] Christian
[1:33:02] they don't die after that he was seen of
[1:33:04] James then to of all the apostles and
[1:33:08] last watchpower and last I told the
[1:33:11] story The testimony of everybody but I'm
[1:33:14] also part of that testimony at last
[1:33:18] at last everybody okay of all he was sin
[1:33:23] of me also watch me as of one born out
[1:33:29] of what
[1:33:30] due time for I am the list of the
[1:33:34] apostle
[1:33:35] that I am not meant to be called a water
[1:33:40] who was Paul an apostle
[1:33:43] he was watching and I call an apostle
[1:33:47] because I did what
[1:33:50] I persecuted the water
[1:33:52] that's a memory in Paul look how he's
[1:33:55] crushing that memory you ready watch how
[1:33:58] he's crushing the memory in the next
[1:34:00] verse he said because I persecuted the
[1:34:03] Church of God but do you see first then
[1:34:06] do you see
[1:34:07] do you see in other words that always
[1:34:09] carry my antidote every time the devil
[1:34:13] will come back and say you Paul you
[1:34:16] persecuted the church you were bad
[1:34:19] you're a liar you're not supposed to
[1:34:21] preach this gospel Paul have the
[1:34:24] appropriate weapon
[1:34:28] do you hear me
[1:34:30] you hear me he said bye to verse 10 by
[1:34:34] the water
[1:34:37] [Music]
[1:34:41] by the grace of God I water
[1:34:45] can you read louder
[1:34:46] hey I am water
[1:34:49] in other words I am just the way I am
[1:34:52] regardless of what you know
[1:34:55] I am what I am
[1:34:58] how can a man like me Paul preach the
[1:35:02] gospel and people accepted me a man who
[1:35:04] get in the city everybody ran away
[1:35:08] by the grace of God I am what I am and
[1:35:13] his grace which was bestowed upon me was
[1:35:17] not in water
[1:35:19] so you holding to your memories
[1:35:23] if you want to go home you can go I have
[1:35:25] to finish what I have to finish you
[1:35:27] holding on in your memory you are
[1:35:30] actually making the grace of God vain
[1:35:42] Hallelujah which was bestowed upon me
[1:35:45] was not in vain but
[1:35:48] even I'm the least of the Apostles look
[1:35:51] how Paul rise up as a messenger but I
[1:35:54] labor more abundantly than day water how
[1:35:59] can he say something like that
[1:36:02] he understood the power of Grace
[1:36:06] in either way God put me as a messenger
[1:36:08] I am what I am he chose me regardless of
[1:36:12] my past I'm gonna be what he told me to
[1:36:15] be and then I'm gonna preach with that
[1:36:17] complex and when I see Peter good
[1:36:19] deviating I will tell Peter in the face
[1:36:22] I say Peter what you're doing is not the
[1:36:24] word of God
[1:36:25] Paul didn't say if I talk to Peter Peter
[1:36:27] will say you know what you did to the
[1:36:29] Church of the god right Paul didn't look
[1:36:31] at that that way I am what I am whatever
[1:36:34] was passed today is put under the blood
[1:36:36] and no fishing
[1:36:39] Hallelujah he said a more abundantly
[1:36:42] than they are yet not I but the water
[1:36:46] look at the power but what the grace of
[1:36:50] God which was inward with me
