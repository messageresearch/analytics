[24:36] but lord jesus i know there's nothing
[24:38] nothing too hard for our god and lord
[24:41] jesus if he was able to have
[24:43] abraham to believe that if he was the

[39:36] every day
[39:39] amen
[39:40] glory to god how many are reading the
[39:42] cod book
[39:44] and the church ages
[39:48] i
[39:48] run across the 70 weeks and i can't
[39:51] touch them because you have not gotten
[39:53] there yet
[39:54] if i go on there some of you will be
[39:56] completely lost
[39:58] so you need to hurry up
[40:00] with your reading
[40:01] and start catching up quickly so
[40:04] whenever it's ready you dig into the 70
[40:07] weeks you soak the information then when
[40:09] i come in we are soaring like eagles
[40:12] amen
[40:13] remember one question a day one question
[40:16] a day so by the end of the month you
[40:18] should have 30 questions
[40:20] you will see what it's going to do to
[40:22] you you wonder where i know what i know
[40:24] because i'm reading brother branham
[40:27] amen we're not like catholic where we
[40:30] have a different books
[40:32] i have the same bible you have
[40:34] we have the same author of the bible and
[40:37] we have the same message
[40:39] and everybody is
[40:41] he is free
[40:44] to go search dig and find out what the
[40:46] lord is saying amen
[40:48] glory be to the name of the lord now
[40:51] this is a hard one how many read daniel
[40:55] 2 and daniel 7
[40:58] praise be the name of the lord whoever
[41:01] didn't do it
[41:02] i'm sorry but i'm not responsible for
[41:05] you if you get lost i am not coming back
[41:08] again
[41:10] to keep reading the scripture because
[41:12] you are slowing us down
[41:14] amen i will continue to move you're
[41:17] going to catch a home and go home and
[41:19] read it amen
[41:21] amen
[41:22] i gave you the message earlier i don't
[41:25] know what time it was just read two
[41:27] chapters because i know what it is if
[41:29] you know the background of the story it
[41:31] makes me it makes everything easier to
[41:34] move on but when i say do you know this
[41:36] you don't even know what i'm talking
[41:38] about so it's even hard for me to go i
[41:40] want you to be grounded in the scripture
[41:43] that's one of the biggest errors that
[41:45] was done in the message
[41:47] people were grounded in the quote
[41:50] and didn't know the scripture
[41:52] that's pretty bad
[41:54] amen the quote that recording came from
[41:57] the scripture
[42:00] amen so you need to know the scripture
[42:02] and then back it up with the quote then
[42:05] the message is clear for you amen
[42:08] our question and answer will be on
[42:09] september the 24th
[42:12] lord's willing the children day that we
[42:16] need to talk to them and pray will be
[42:17] october 1st
[42:19] lord's willing and uh
[42:21] brother david asked me if we can make a
[42:24] group uh like
[42:26] a what's-up group for the entire church
[42:30] where we can drop in the
[42:33] the announcement because some of them
[42:34] got flyers and stuff like that which is
[42:37] hard to send through a text but he's
[42:39] going to turn the comment off
[42:42] so nobody say thank you thank you thank
[42:44] you and we have a hundred thank you
[42:46] coming up and nobody can sleep and and
[42:48] somebody cannot sleep at night so we're
[42:50] gonna turn the comment off completely
[42:52] and he will try to work if the um if he
[42:55] can put a link where you have your
[42:57] question and answer you can go click on
[42:59] the link and put your question and
[43:01] answer or if we need a head count or
[43:03] something like that are you okay with
[43:05] that or not
[43:06] i told him i want to get a feel from the
[43:08] church
[43:09] amen so let me see your hand if you okay
[43:13] okay i have almost a majority here
[43:15] brother david so you got a green light
[43:17] we can go ahead and start it on amen
[43:20] remember you got your comment send it on
[43:22] the side we're gonna turn it off
[43:24] amen it is strictly for announcement we
[43:27] don't want any video being posted there
[43:30] about what you seen on tick tock
[43:33] don't post it there
[43:34] even if it's good it's a good quote
[43:37] don't post it there go to the youth
[43:39] group chat and
[43:41] all the chats that we have there you can
[43:43] post today amen
[43:44] amen
[43:46] okay before somebody else put something
[43:47] on tick tock i thought it's gonna
[43:49] inspire somebody so don't put it this is
[43:51] just for announcement everybody okay
[43:54] that's the easiest way to go with it so
[43:56] let's go to our scripture this morning
[44:01] you need to have your bible
[44:05] you need to have your bible and you need
[44:07] to really stay alert
[44:12] everybody okay
[44:14] let me ask you this again how many look
[44:16] at the seals
[44:19] i told you to review the seals and i
[44:21] gave you even the link
[44:23] you reviewed them
[44:25] if you did in review it is on your own
[44:28] responsibility except if you know it
[44:31] everybody okay
[44:33] trust me i would never face crust with
[44:35] your blood in my hand
[44:37] amen
[44:38] sometimes i ask people i say is
[44:40] everything okay they say it's okay and i
[44:42] know it's not okay
[44:44] and when you're telling me you're okay i
[44:46] pull back and i push the break and i'm
[44:48] waiting for you till the day you're
[44:50] gonna tell me it's not okay
[44:52] because i can't force
[44:54] my savior only knock at the door
[44:56] if you open then he can get in if you do
[44:59] not open i will just close so when i ask
[45:01] you is everything okay you don't know
[45:03] what i saw
[45:05] some of your trouble i already seen them
[45:07] a long time ago i'm just quiet and
[45:09] waiting because i'm dealing with a hard
[45:12] wall of pride
[45:15] where it's difficult for somebody to
[45:17] acknowledge when they're wrong
[45:19] i have to push i have to push i have to
[45:21] push i have to push and i have to sit
[45:23] until you open up then i will tell you i
[45:25] say
[45:26] in months so and so two years ago the
[45:28] lord already showed me that this is your
[45:30] problem this is what you need to do but
[45:32] i'm dealing with a lot of shelter
[45:38] you know what a shelter is
[45:40] do you know what a shelter is
[45:42] do you know when jesus was talking to
[45:44] the woman anywhere she began to discuss
[45:47] about religion
[45:49] how can you discuss religion you
[45:50] approach it
[45:56] anybody okay
[45:57] if she knew that the messiah you the jew
[45:59] we samaritan we worship if you knew all
[46:02] of that why you didn't change your life
[46:04] [Music]
[46:06] everybody okay if you already know about
[46:08] the messiah your life should not be the
[46:10] way you're living
[46:11] that's exactly a lot of message
[46:13] believers
[46:14] [Music]
[46:15] when you talk to them they will impress
[46:17] you the sales this this this and then we
[46:19] were in the convention and stuff you
[46:21] just keep watching them but your life is
[46:23] not
[46:24] nothing
[46:25] reflecting nothing of the message of the
[46:27] hour you're not reflecting the message
[46:29] you are completely like a man on the
[46:32] street
[46:33] the way you're treating your family the
[46:35] way you're treating your wife the way
[46:36] you're treating people completely
[46:38] doesn't even reflect the message at all
[46:40] but if i come right straight you pull
[46:43] the wall to show me that you have been
[46:45] in the message 20 years
[46:47] i will push my break and just keep
[46:48] waiting
[46:50] when you drop down then i'll pick you up
[46:52] and say i already knew this five years
[46:54] ago
[46:56] let's go to daniel chapter two
[47:00] i hope somebody got my message
[47:04] don't try to solve your problem yourself
[47:09] solve your problem according to the
[47:11] world
[47:12] according to the message of the hour
[47:15] that's why sometimes you are send me a
[47:17] question and you see i'm lingering
[47:19] because i want to see the mind of god on
[47:21] your question
[47:22] and then suddenly you will see a quote
[47:24] coming up like a whirlwind
[47:26] and exactly what the person asked me for
[47:29] and then i pulled the code and i gave it
[47:31] to you in other words i'm telling you
[47:33] this is the prescription
[47:35] that god gave us through the messenger
[47:38] for you to overcome this
[47:42] as simple as it looks like
[47:44] take it
[47:46] swallow it everything will be okay the
[47:48] problem is many of us are like neyman
[47:53] [Music]
[47:56] can i say it
[47:57] can i say it many of us are like naiman
[48:01] when you tell them what to do you
[48:02] already have a preconceived pentecostal
[48:05] idea
[48:05] [Music]
[48:07] everybody okay
[48:09] if i tell you go fast
[48:11] two weeks you're gonna do it because
[48:12] that's what you want that's what
[48:14] pentecostal usually do when they got a
[48:16] problem they run too fast
[48:19] who told you too fast
[48:22] who told you to do it
[48:24] my body said amen there who told you to
[48:27] faster
[48:29] you go fasting when the lord told you
[48:31] who told you to go pray five times a day
[48:36] who told you to do it
[48:38] amen
[48:39] it is as simple as believing
[48:43] this is the victory that overcome of the
[48:45] world which is our
[48:47] that simple faith
[48:48] that's why when the disciple came they
[48:50] say lord increase our faith do you know
[48:53] what god say
[48:56] he said if you have a faith like what in
[48:58] other words they were looking at big
[49:00] faith now i got a big faith now mountain
[49:03] move jesus said say you don't understand
[49:05] that small faith that you see there can
[49:07] move that big mountain that you see
[49:09] there your biggest problem that you see
[49:12] there can be removed by a small little
[49:15] faith like this
[49:16] can can can deliver you
[49:19] easily
[49:21] but the problem is when we tell you go
[49:23] down to jordan 7 time no
[49:27] because td jakes told you
[49:30] joel austin told you
[49:33] whoever pentecostal you are listening
[49:35] towards you
[49:36] you need to go in a mountain
[49:39] you're going to find a snake there
[49:45] who send you to the mountain
[49:47] you're not a prophet
[49:49] brother brother even himself the lord
[49:51] told him he said you are not the prophet
[49:52] like the old one
[49:54] you need to be a prophet in suit
[49:57] in sheep clothing
[49:59] [Music]
[50:05] let's go to daniel chapter 31
[50:10] chapter 2 uh verse 31 thank you

[50:17] wasting your time and one of this day

[50:37] boss asked me i say i asked him i asked
[50:40] her she told me she's okay
[50:45] 31
[50:48] sometimes i wonder if you know what a
[50:50] pastor means
[50:55] he's still young
[51:02] i don't know where that one comes from
[51:04] he's still too young
[51:09] he need more experience
[51:14] wait

[51:18] you are king so
[51:21] if you read this at home you find now
[51:24] you are king so

[52:15] this great image
[52:17] whose brightness was excellent
[52:20] amen
[52:22] stood before you
[52:24] and the form thereof was terrible
[52:28] you ready
[52:30] this image head was a fine
[52:34] gold so the head of this image
[52:39] is made of gold
[52:42] you're going to wonder how we're going
[52:43] to move this and go through the serpent
[52:45] see then come up
[52:47] everybody okay
[52:48] so that's why i say stay alert
[52:51] this image head
[52:53] was of fine gold
[52:55] its breast and its arm
[52:58] of silver so the breast
[53:02] and the arm
[53:06] are silver
[53:10] amen
[53:11] and it's barely and its ties
[53:15] are of breath
[53:18] the belly
[53:21] and the tie
[53:23] are of brass

[53:30] and it's leg
[53:32] of iron
[53:34] the legs
[53:36] there's two of them
[53:38] are of
[53:40] iron how many arms do we have
[53:47] we okay
[53:49] okay
[53:51] karma it's feet
[53:54] part of it water
[53:56] and part of it
[53:58] how many feet do we have
[54:10] part water
[54:12] and what
[54:15] it's feet
[54:19] what do we need the feet
[54:23] you start getting it
[54:26] you start getting it
[54:28] where was sleep roof sleeping
[54:32] is it okay now is that blending
[54:36] if you are lost you just do this
[54:40] okay
[54:41] lost
[54:42] the feet we talk about the feet the roof
[54:45] sleeping on the feet of boas
[54:48] when we talk about revelation 10 when
[54:50] the engine came down he had feet like
[54:53] pillars of fire everybody okay now
[54:57] okay blessed be the name of the lord
[55:00] verse 34 you saw it
[55:02] till that a stone so right here we have
[55:06] one
[55:07] we have two we have three we have four
[55:11] we have five so this image is not really
[55:13] four
[55:15] like the people put it it's five
[55:20] hey buddy okay
[55:21] okay you saw it till that stone
[55:25] was cut out without water it doesn't
[55:28] have nothing to do with human
[55:34] if a stone is cut with hand it's a human
[55:37] effort
[55:39] amen there is no human input here
[55:43] anybody okay
[55:44] it's cut without hand
[55:46] which smote the image
[55:49] upon its water
[55:51] so that stone never targeted the head
[55:56] that was the stone of david
[56:00] the stone of david have to go straight
[56:02] to the head of goliath but not this one
[56:06] this one doesn't target the breast of
[56:08] the arm it doesn't target the belly all
[56:11] the time it doesn't target the leg it
[56:13] targets only the feet
[56:18] what does he do when he targets the feet
[56:20] when he hit the feet what happened to
[56:23] the image
[56:24] in other words the the the strength
[56:27] of this image
[56:30] because goliath they hit him one shot
[56:33] and they drop him down but this image
[56:35] also have a specific spot that if you
[56:38] hit it you don't have to worry about any
[56:41] other spot
[56:42] but that's part of his defeat
[56:48] do you see why i need helm
[56:52] everybody okay
[56:53] and he hit the feet that were in iron
[56:57] and clay and broke them to water
[57:01] then
[57:03] a cascade begin
[57:05] like they're taking a building in
[57:06] downtown and pulling that down have you
[57:08] seen that before it's like boom and then
[57:10] you see the building going down
[57:12] then
[57:13] was the iron
[57:15] the clay
[57:16] the brass the silver the gold broken to
[57:20] water
[57:21] how can you hit something at the feet
[57:25] everybody okay
[57:26] and it's breaking everything in pieces
[57:33] we can go even get a brass we have an
[57:36] eagle there
[57:37] outside there
[57:39] okay go take a stone and hit that ego
[57:43] if you will see that ego coming up in
[57:45] pieces
[57:47] so it's a different stone
[57:50] amen
[57:51] it is not your stone on the outside here
[57:55] everybody okay
[57:56] and that stone have to hit only one
[57:59] target
[58:01] and the whole image
[58:03] no matter the material
[58:05] [Music]
[58:07] it doesn't matter the strength of the
[58:10] material
[58:11] it's bringing everything down
[58:14] in pieces
[58:16] everybody okay
[58:18] and became that stone and and those
[58:21] pieces became like the shaft do you know
[58:24] what the shaft is
[58:26] the shack
[58:27] the seeds shall not air with the shack
[58:29] another word for the shark is the shaft
[58:32] [Music]
[58:33] so these pieces become like
[58:37] so there will be something be reacting
[58:40] like a shack when this stone is
[58:43] hitting right here
[58:48] like the chef of the summer
[58:50] water
[58:52] where are we at
[58:55] where are we
[58:57] going
[58:59] we okay
[59:01] so we we're here we are dealing with the
[59:03] shack
[59:07] on the water
[59:13] anybody okay
[59:15] you need to have your bible please i
[59:17] know what i'm talking about
[59:19] everybody okay
[59:21] and the wind carried them away
[59:24] the wind means something
[59:26] that no place was found for them
[59:29] and the stone that smote the image
[59:32] became a great water
[59:37] you know when we say mountain we're
[59:39] talking about this
[59:41] the mountain doesn't look like this
[59:43] you're talking about this so the stone
[59:45] has is growing up
[59:49] [Music]
[59:54] we okay
[59:55] okay everybody okay
[59:57] he became like a great mountain and
[1:00:00] filled water
[1:00:04] you remember the lever
[1:00:07] and
[1:00:09] and the brazen altar one was square
[1:00:13] and the other one was a circle one
[1:00:15] represented the globe and the other one
[1:00:17] have the four corners this mountain is
[1:00:20] filling the earth which is round
[1:00:22] but the mountain is filling on them in
[1:00:24] the middle of it
[1:00:27] did you get it or did i lose you
[1:00:30] did i lose you
[1:00:32] we okay
[1:00:33] so the earth which is like around
[1:00:36] like a ball is filled with a mountain
[1:00:40] so we got a pyramid in the middle of a
[1:00:42] circle
[1:00:47] you see now so when a struck a move into
[1:00:50] the pyramid
[1:00:53] with a
[1:00:55] circle
[1:00:59] we okay
[1:01:00] blessed be the name of the lord
[1:01:03] oh my god 36
[1:01:04] this is the dream
[1:01:06] and we will tell the interpretation
[1:01:08] thereof before the king
[1:01:10] this is the interpretation
[1:01:12] your king
[1:01:14] are a king of kings
[1:01:17] who is that king nebuchadnezzar
[1:01:20] he is a king of kings
[1:01:23] but we know the king of kings
[1:01:25] why is this one also king of kings
[1:01:28] and this is daniel the prophet
[1:01:31] telling nebuchadnezzar you're the king
[1:01:33] of kings
[1:01:37] okay
[1:01:38] he say for the god of heaven
[1:01:42] has given you a kingdom
[1:01:45] power and strength and glory
[1:01:48] and wherever the children of men dwell
[1:01:51] the beast of the field and the file of
[1:01:53] the heaven has he given into your hand
[1:01:56] and has made you ruler over them all
[1:01:59] you are the head of water
[1:02:01] so the head of god is the babylonian
[1:02:04] kingdom
[1:02:08] everybody here
[1:02:09] the babylonian kingdom under king
[1:02:12] nebuchadnezzar
[1:02:14] we okay now
[1:02:16] verse
[1:02:18] 39 and after you shall rise another
[1:02:21] kingdom
[1:02:22] inferior so the strength is
[1:02:26] everybody okay so as you move from here
[1:02:29] the strength is getting water
[1:02:33] so if the strength is decreasing
[1:02:36] everybody okay as we're moving down
[1:02:39] which one is the weakest point
[1:02:46] [Music]
[1:02:48] we okay
[1:02:50] okay
[1:02:52] another inferior to you and another
[1:02:54] third kingdom of brass
[1:02:56] which shall be rule which shall bear
[1:02:59] rule over the earth
[1:03:00] and the fourth kingdom shall be strong
[1:03:04] as iron
[1:03:05] anybody okay
[1:03:06] for as much as i on breaking pieces and
[1:03:09] subdue all the things
[1:03:11] strange now this iron here can break all
[1:03:15] of this
[1:03:19] anybody okay
[1:03:20] but if you strike it when it's mixed
[1:03:22] with clay
[1:03:23] it breaks everything
[1:03:25] what a paradox
[1:03:28] anybody okay the fourth kingdom shall be
[1:03:30] strong as iron for as much as iron
[1:03:33] breaks in pieces and subdue all things
[1:03:36] and as iron that breaks all these shall
[1:03:38] he break in pieces and bruise
[1:03:41] and whereas you saw the feet
[1:03:44] and water
[1:03:45] i'm not going to get into those details
[1:03:48] part of porter's clay and part of iron
[1:03:51] the kingdom shall be divided
[1:03:53] but they shall be in it
[1:03:55] even though it's divided they shall be
[1:03:58] in it of the strength of the iron for as
[1:04:00] much as you saw the iron mixed with
[1:04:03] merry claim and as the toe
[1:04:06] of the feet were part of iron and part
[1:04:08] of clay so the kingdom shall be partly
[1:04:11] strong and partly water
[1:04:13] and whereas you sow iron mixed with
[1:04:16] merry clay they shall mingle themselves
[1:04:19] with the seed of man
[1:04:22] human alliances
[1:04:24] but they shall not cleave one to another
[1:04:27] hypocritical
[1:04:28] friendship
[1:04:30] full of it in a message
[1:04:32] iron and clay
[1:04:34] everybody okay even as iron is not mixed
[1:04:38] with water
[1:04:39] everybody okay so far verse 44 and in
[1:04:42] the days of these kings shall the god of
[1:04:46] heaven set up a kingdom
[1:04:48] which shall never be destroyed and the
[1:04:51] kingdom shall not be left to other
[1:04:53] people but he shall break in pieces so
[1:04:56] that stone is a kingdom
[1:05:00] that stone itself it's a kingdom
[1:05:03] amen
[1:05:04] anybody okay
[1:05:05] he shall break in pieces and consume all
[1:05:08] this kingdom
[1:05:09] and it shall stand forever for as much
[1:05:13] as you saw the stone was cut out of the
[1:05:15] mountain without hands
[1:05:17] and that he broke in pieces
[1:05:21] that stone came out of a mountain and it
[1:05:24] became a mountain
[1:05:25] [Music]
[1:05:28] the stone was in a mountain they removed
[1:05:31] it from a mountain but the stone itself
[1:05:33] is a mountain
[1:05:37] [Music]
[1:05:39] we okay
[1:05:51] everybody okay
[1:05:52] this is a mountain
[1:05:54] anybody okay
[1:05:55] when you cut this stone right here
[1:05:58] this stone will come out of a mountain
[1:06:01] but when the stone come out of a
[1:06:02] mountain it is also a mountain
[1:06:07] this is the mountain
[1:06:10] everybody okay but when you cut this
[1:06:12] mountain there is a stone that come out
[1:06:15] but that stone itself is also a mountain
[1:06:20] did you get what i'm saying this is a
[1:06:22] pyramid
[1:06:23] when you cut the stone the stone that
[1:06:25] came out is also a pyramid
[1:06:30] we okay now
[1:06:32] praise god
[1:06:33] verse 45 for as much as you saw the
[1:06:36] stone was cut out of a mountain without
[1:06:38] hand and that he broke in pieces the eye
[1:06:40] on the brass the clay the silver and the
[1:06:42] gold the great god has made known to the
[1:06:45] king
[1:06:46] the word shall come to pass hereafter
[1:06:49] and the dream is certain and the
[1:06:51] interpretation thereof sure everybody

[1:07:56] of the mother in other words he
[1:07:58] summarized it
[1:08:00] daniel spoke and said
[1:08:01] i saw in my vision by night and behold
[1:08:04] the four winds of heaven strove upon the
[1:08:08] water so we see here
[1:08:12] i have to go this way
[1:08:14] because this is very deep
[1:08:18] we see here that there is a sea
[1:08:22] everybody okay
[1:08:23] and this sea
[1:08:25] of course is filled with water
[1:08:27] anybody care
[1:08:29] and for some reason four winds
[1:08:33] everybody okay
[1:08:35] come
[1:08:37] the wind
[1:08:39] what is the wind
[1:08:42] everybody okay

[1:08:45] and trouble they see
[1:08:47] in other words the water that was
[1:08:49] peaceful is now trouble completely
[1:08:53] and when the water is agitated and
[1:08:55] troubled

[1:10:29] the beast never came
[1:10:32] but after the water was troubled by the
[1:10:36] wind
[1:10:37] anybody care so the traveling of the
[1:10:40] water by the wind
[1:10:42] calls four beats to come and every beast
[1:10:46] is different from another one that's
[1:10:49] what the scriptures say
[1:10:51] all right verse five well verse four
[1:10:54] the first beast you're following me the

[1:11:28] everybody okay
[1:11:29] how many wings does this ego have
[1:11:35] everybody okay
[1:11:37] now when he came out
[1:11:39] daniel said i beheld
[1:11:41] till the wings
[1:11:43] thereof were plucked

[1:11:54] is a lion
[1:11:57] with egoings
[1:12:00] everybody okay

[1:12:07] it is a lion
[1:12:10] mixed with the eagle's wings
[1:12:14] ever here
[1:12:15] but as he progressed
[1:12:18] everybody here
[1:12:20] the wings of the ego will be removed
[1:12:24] we okay

[1:12:29] lion
[1:12:33] are we
[1:12:34] okay verse uh to four
[1:12:38] i beheld till the wings thereof were
[1:12:40] plugged
[1:12:41] and it was lifted up from the water
[1:12:44] so when they removed the wings of the
[1:12:47] ego everybody care something happened to
[1:12:51] this lion
[1:12:53] this lion who was uh
[1:12:55] a four-footed beast
[1:12:58] stood up

[1:14:42] just a beast
[1:14:43] it's going to incarnate

[1:19:17] remember
[1:19:18] in the dream of naboo kanezo
[1:19:21] the first kingdom was like what
[1:19:24] he breaks everything
[1:19:26] amen
[1:19:27] you remember and this one is a beast

[1:20:11] everybody okay
[1:20:12] job to verse 16.
[1:20:14] [Music]
[1:20:16] the double says
[1:20:17] i come near to one of them that stood by
[1:20:21] and i asked him the truth
[1:20:23] of all this so he told me and made me
[1:20:26] know the interpretation of the thing so
[1:20:28] daniel went to the one that was showing
[1:20:30] him the vision and he said let me ask
[1:20:32] you a question what is all of this and
[1:20:35] the angel explained to daniel everybody
[1:20:37] okay
[1:20:38] verse 17
[1:20:39] these great beasts
[1:20:41] which are four
[1:20:43] are for water
[1:20:45] so at the first they are kings
[1:20:52] if you stuck here you'll be in trouble
[1:20:55] everybody okay
[1:20:56] they are kings everybody okay
[1:20:59] we know nebuchadnezzar was also a king
[1:21:02] we know darius was a king
[1:21:05] if you read josh bababo you know what
[1:21:06] i'm saying by the riots in the book of
[1:21:08] daniel
[1:21:09] these great beasts which are four or
[1:21:11] four kings which shall erase out of the
[1:21:14] water
[1:21:16] so the rising from the sea
[1:21:19] is the rising from the earth we okay now
[1:21:24] but the rise only after the war there
[1:21:27] are trouble we okay
[1:21:30] verse
[1:21:31] 18 but the scent of the most high
[1:21:34] shall take the kingdom and possess the
[1:21:37] kingdom forever
[1:21:39] even forever and water
[1:21:43] now it is not the most high god but it's
[1:21:45] the scent of the most high
[1:21:48] or when we were dealing with the image
[1:21:50] of nebuchadnezzar it was a stone but
[1:21:53] here it is a people
[1:21:59] everybody okay over here it is a stone
[1:22:02] but over there it is a people
[1:22:08] everybody okay
[1:22:10] verse uh 19 then i will know the truth
[1:22:15] of the fall beast
[1:22:16] which was diverse from all the other
[1:22:19] exceeding dreadful who's thief where of
[1:22:22] iron and his nail of water another
[1:22:25] description the nail are of water
[1:22:30] you see how you need to read your bible
[1:22:32] everybody okay
[1:22:34] daniella's brass which the devourer
[1:22:37] pieces stamped the residue with its feet
[1:22:41] and of the ten horns that were uh in his
[1:22:43] head and of uh
[1:22:46] the other which came up and before whom
[1:22:48] three fell even of the horn that had
[1:22:51] eyes and a mouth that spoke very great
[1:22:53] things whose look was more start than
[1:22:55] his fellow everybody okay
[1:22:58] daniel says
[1:22:59] i understand what you displayed to me
[1:23:02] and the explanation about the three
[1:23:04] beasts but i have a question mr angel
[1:23:08] tell me more about this fourth beast
[1:23:10] here i want to know more about it
[1:23:14] everybody okay
[1:23:15] daniel was more interested
[1:23:18] to know about the last beast
[1:23:21] anybody okay
[1:23:22] according to the first interpretation
[1:23:25] every animal is a water
[1:23:27] a king job to verse 23.
[1:23:30] so i can run quickly
[1:23:33] does he say
[1:23:34] the fourth beast
[1:23:37] shall be the fourth water
[1:23:41] so not only are they kings but they are
[1:23:44] water
[1:23:48] that's why you need to be very careful
[1:23:50] when you're listening to brother brother
[1:23:52] upon the earth which shall be diverse
[1:23:54] from our kingdom and shall devour the
[1:23:58] whole earth and shall throw it down and
[1:24:00] break breaking pieces everybody okay and
[1:24:03] the ten horns out of this kingdom are 10
[1:24:06] watts
[1:24:07] everybody okay now so we begin to
[1:24:10] understand here that when they give the
[1:24:12] explanation to daniel they don't tell
[1:24:15] him really how the beast look like they
[1:24:17] just tell him this is another kingdom
[1:24:21] that's all
[1:24:22] remember in daniel 12 they locked the
[1:24:25] thunder from daniel
[1:24:27] because daniel wanted to know the tandem
[1:24:29] they say it doesn't belong to you leave
[1:24:31] it alone just keep moving your way
[1:24:33] everybody okay so so far we don't know
[1:24:36] this beast how we look like all we know
[1:24:40] we have iron teeth ten horns and nails
[1:24:43] this is a kingdom a kingdom a kingdom a
[1:24:45] kingdom a king a king a king a king
[1:24:48] everybody
[1:24:48] okay let's go to revelation 18 then we
[1:24:51] move on
[1:24:54] lord help me
[1:24:57] if you dare you can say amen
[1:25:00] verse 1 and after these things i saw
[1:25:03] another angel come down from heaven
[1:25:04] having great power
[1:25:06] and the earth was lightened with his
[1:25:08] glory

[1:25:11] voice saying babylon

[1:28:19] and then water
[1:28:22] and then water
[1:28:24] gold right
[1:28:27] purple scarlet and deck with gold and
[1:28:30] with water
[1:28:32] precious stone
[1:28:37] and pearl
[1:28:39] right here we can preach till the end of
[1:28:41] the year
[1:28:42] [Music]
[1:28:44] everybody okay
[1:28:45] everybody okay
[1:28:46] now remember brother branham say
[1:28:49] scripture does not play with water
[1:28:52] whatever is in the record it's there for
[1:28:55] the anointed us to do what
[1:28:57] it's there forever
[1:28:59] so there is nothing in the bible that is
[1:29:01] there for game
[1:29:04] amen
[1:29:06] amen
[1:29:07] my subject this morning
[1:29:09] is the four faces of roof
[1:29:12] babylon
[1:29:13] and the wings of ego
[1:29:19] everybody okay
[1:29:20] babylon and the wings of
[1:29:22] ego stay alert we're gonna travel
[1:29:25] differently now everybody okay
[1:29:28] we are still in the trashing floor you
[1:29:30] found it right there
[1:29:32] amen
[1:29:33] with roof
[1:29:34] and we also dealing with the parable of
[1:29:37] the 10th virgin
[1:29:39] where we are emphasizing on the second
[1:29:41] oil and we stared at last sunday that's
[1:29:44] the reason why we went through the trail
[1:29:46] of the serpent because the trail of the
[1:29:49] serpent is the beginning of sin
[1:29:51] because eve unlocked the nature that was
[1:29:54] locked by god eve opened the door to sin
[1:29:58] eve opened the door to the corner nature
[1:30:01] brother branham says this
[1:30:03] he says there is god's seed under
[1:30:06] innocence in the garden of eden
[1:30:09] not knowing all at all that they were
[1:30:12] naked and the reveal of the water
[1:30:16] there them from water so sin was already
[1:30:20] there in the garden of eden because sin
[1:30:23] originated from heaven you remember and
[1:30:26] sin came down on the earth but both of
[1:30:29] them were there from sin
[1:30:31] so the corner act of eve open the door
[1:30:34] to the sin into the world
[1:30:37] [Music]
[1:30:39] everybody okay so far when we go into
[1:30:41] our tabernacle language we are very very
[1:30:45] very deep now into the holiest
[1:30:50] everybody okay
[1:30:51] we found out that the tabernacle have
[1:30:54] three steps
[1:30:56] justification in the other court
[1:30:58] sanctification in the holy and then the
[1:31:01] baptism of the holy spirit which is in
[1:31:03] the holiest
[1:31:04] everybody okay according to ezekiel
[1:31:07] under justification you receive a new
[1:31:09] heart under sanctification you receive a
[1:31:11] new spirit and under the baptism of the
[1:31:14] holy spirit you receive the spirit of
[1:31:15] god open with me first john chapter 5
[1:31:21] hallelujah
[1:31:23] glory to god
[1:31:26] if you dare you can say amen
[1:31:31] first john chapter 5 verse 6
[1:31:35] pages are still turning
[1:31:37] if you dare you can say amen
[1:31:39] the bible say this is he
[1:31:42] that came by water
[1:31:44] the first element here is water
[1:31:51] everybody okay
[1:31:52] karma
[1:31:53] or not by water and by water
[1:31:56] the second element is blood
[1:32:00] i promise to you one day that i will get
[1:32:02] to this
[1:32:04] even who
[1:32:05] jesus christ
[1:32:07] not by water only
[1:32:09] but by water and water
[1:32:13] in other words both of them are
[1:32:14] important
[1:32:17] anybody care you cannot have water and
[1:32:20] stop right there
[1:32:21] everybody care jesus himself have to go
[1:32:24] by water and the blood
[1:32:26] but do we stop there
[1:32:28] let's continue and it is the water
[1:32:34] are we okay it is the water
[1:32:36] so the third element is water
[1:32:42] everybody okay so right now we have the
[1:32:44] water
[1:32:46] we have the blood
[1:32:47] and we have the water and the bible said
[1:32:50] that jesus came by water
[1:32:52] but not water only but he also came by
[1:32:55] water
[1:32:56] but not only blood only but we know in
[1:32:58] the river of jordan what happened to him
[1:33:01] the spirit of god got into him in other
[1:33:04] words there are three steps

[1:33:13] in the tabernacle
[1:33:15] everybody okay so far i'm blending saint
[1:33:18] john before we take off anybody okay
[1:33:21] because the spirit
[1:33:24] is truth
[1:33:25] and it is the spirit that beareth
[1:33:27] witness because the spirit is truth
[1:33:30] verse seven for there are how many
[1:33:33] there be a record where so we have
[1:33:36] heaven
[1:33:38] glory to god
[1:33:40] and we have also earth
[1:33:43] in heaven how many do we have
[1:33:46] so we have one we have two and we have
[1:33:49] three we need to know them
[1:33:51] the bible says they are three double
[1:33:54] record in heaven
[1:33:56] the who
[1:33:57] the father
[1:34:01] and the second one is who
[1:34:03] the word

[1:35:03] any question
[1:35:05] praise be the name of the lord
[1:35:08] all these three are water
[1:35:11] so when you talk about the father you
[1:35:13] talk about the holy ghost
[1:35:15] when you talk about the holy ghost

[1:37:31] hebrew 12 that word for jesus also that
[1:37:35] he must sanctify the people with his
[1:37:37] water

[1:38:27] you cannot have the father without the
[1:38:30] son
[1:38:32] you cannot have the holy ghost without
[1:38:34] having both the father and the son but
[1:38:38] you can be justified
[1:38:41] without
[1:38:42] being and you can be sanctified without
[1:38:46] receiving water
[1:38:48] they are green in water
[1:38:50] but father son and holy ghost are water
[1:38:53] you can be in one court
[1:38:56] other court justified by faith believing
[1:39:00] you can be in another court
[1:39:02] clean up from the life of sin and
[1:39:05] sanctify but you can miss the baptism of
[1:39:08] the holy ghost
[1:39:10] baby in other words if you have the
[1:39:14] father
[1:39:16] you don't have to worry about the sun

[1:44:30] so they shout
[1:44:32] when he hit the virgin
[1:44:34] they shout toward them
[1:44:37] everybody here that you need to wake up
[1:44:41] everybody here
[1:44:42] but if you look at the shout
[1:44:45] he only said the bridegroom cometh
[1:44:50] but the bridegroom cometh when he enter
[1:44:53] in the ear of a virgin
[1:44:55] it means that i got a world cup
[1:45:01] not only do i need to wake up i gotta
[1:45:03] clean up
[1:45:06] and not only do i need to clean up i
[1:45:08] gotta watch if i have the second one
[1:45:12] [Music]
[1:45:14] yes sir here
[1:45:16] everybody okay
[1:45:18] erasing
[1:45:19] doesn't guarantee you to meet the
[1:45:22] bridegroom
[1:45:27] can i continue because five virgins
[1:45:30] arose
[1:45:31] the bible
[1:45:34] cannot continue
[1:45:36] the bible say how many drug generals
[1:45:40] how many virgins arose
[1:45:42] how many virgins keep them
[1:45:45] how many had the holy ghost
[1:45:48] not all of them
[1:45:51] we okay
[1:45:52] so you can arrows it's not a guarantee
[1:45:58] anybody okay you can trim your lamp
[1:46:01] it's not a guarantee
[1:46:03] you can arrows it is not a guarantee
[1:46:07] you can trim your lamp
[1:46:09] it is not a guarantee they only agree in
[1:46:13] one
[1:46:14] but they are not one
[1:46:17] but here they're only a green one
[1:46:20] you can arrows
[1:46:22] you're not a guarantee to go in the
[1:46:24] rupture
[1:46:25] can create sanctified united guaranteed
[1:46:28] to go in the rupture the absolute
[1:46:31] guarantee is water
[1:46:38] [Music]
[1:46:40] everybody here when you have the oil he
[1:46:43] automatically means that you were
[1:46:45] justified
[1:46:47] that you were sanctified
[1:46:49] that's why god see you with the holy
[1:46:52] ghost
[1:46:57] did i lose somebody
[1:46:58] that's why it's very important don't
[1:47:00] stop where you are
[1:47:02] you need to make sure you got the second
[1:47:05] one
[1:47:07] the message came to produce the order
[1:47:14] brother branham
[1:47:16] we okay
[1:47:18] what about them said they are three that
[1:47:20] bear record in heaven in earth the word
[1:47:22] of the blood and water
[1:47:24] there are three different record in
[1:47:25] heaven the father the son and the holy
[1:47:27] ghost these three are water
[1:47:29] but the other one they are not one but
[1:47:31] they agree as water
[1:47:34] you can't have the father without having
[1:47:36] the son you can't have the sun without
[1:47:39] having the father's sun and water
[1:47:42] because they are what they are what
[1:47:45] inseparable but you can be justified
[1:47:49] without being water
[1:47:53] you arose but you have not cleaned your
[1:47:55] lamp yet
[1:47:56] and you can be sanctified without water
[1:48:01] in other words you can trim your lamp
[1:48:03] but you don't have the second oil yet
[1:48:06] can you check that prison
[1:48:09] oh my god i don't know where i am amen
[1:48:12] you can be sanctified but you don't have
[1:48:15] the water
[1:48:16] you can be clean live a pure life and
[1:48:19] have a form of godliness and denying the
[1:48:21] power of healing and speaking in tongues
[1:48:24] and great friends of god and every one
[1:48:26] of them in there
[1:48:28] there is your water
[1:48:31] who had water
[1:48:32] in the water what did they have
[1:48:41] everybody okay so the five words virgin
[1:48:44] have rapture in faith and the rapture in
[1:48:48] faith was in the second oil
[1:48:52] everybody okay
[1:48:54] believing all water
[1:48:56] and water and water and water and these
[1:49:00] five cut out of the remnant was water
[1:49:05] be careful where you are
[1:49:07] you don't need me to tell you where you
[1:49:09] are in the tabernacle you already know
[1:49:11] where you are you go yourself walk in
[1:49:13] the tabernacle and you check if you have
[1:49:15] the holy ghost or not if you are under
[1:49:18] the water remember you need to get the
[1:49:20] blood if you under the blood you need to
[1:49:22] go all the way to the spirit
[1:49:25] in other words if you arrows don't stop
[1:49:27] there make sure you have trim your lamp
[1:49:30] if you trim your lamp you must make sure
[1:49:32] you have the second oil because with
[1:49:34] that the second oil there is absolutely
[1:49:37] no way you can get into the rupture
[1:49:40] everybody okay so far let me change gear
[1:49:43] and remind you this brother branham said
[1:49:46] all this code
[1:49:49] and our process
[1:49:50] and all these things and ism today by
[1:49:53] god's grace every one of them written in
[1:49:55] water where he has its water
[1:49:58] but there it's just got water
[1:50:01] remember it's just another name
[1:50:05] in other words it's just another
[1:50:06] manifestation but it's the same thing
[1:50:10] but you watch the working of the spirit
[1:50:12] in that day and watch how it's working
[1:50:14] today you shall see it's water
[1:50:17] so don't get caught up with name
[1:50:20] don't get caught up with the phone
[1:50:23] watch the working of the spirit in it
[1:50:26] in our scripture reading this morning
[1:50:30] glory to god
[1:50:31] we found that in the book of daniel
[1:50:35] we okay
[1:50:36] that we have two
[1:50:38] separate uh chapter there we have daniel
[1:50:41] chapter two on the one side and we have
[1:50:44] daniel chapter seven on the other side
[1:50:47] when we talk about daniel under on
[1:50:50] daniel chapter 2 we found out that the
[1:50:53] kingdom were divided into five
[1:50:56] the first one is the babylonian over
[1:50:58] there the second one is the middle
[1:51:01] persian that's why it's two armor
[1:51:04] the middle and the persian
[1:51:06] we okay that's why it's two armed
[1:51:09] everybody here and the third one is the
[1:51:11] greece until we got the rome and the
[1:51:14] other one everybody okay
[1:51:16] now we found out that on daniel chapter
[1:51:19] 7
[1:51:20] something happened first to the sea
[1:51:24] the sea was calm
[1:51:26] and the sea was was filled with water
[1:51:29] and suddenly there arose
[1:51:32] uh uh four wins that came in
[1:51:35] and daniel 7
[1:51:37] and daniel 2 are just the same thing
[1:51:44] in another form
[1:51:47] everybody okay
[1:51:49] everybody okay so far
[1:51:52] pharaoh saw a dream
[1:51:56] he saw a dream which were represented
[1:52:00] with seven years of of corn
[1:52:03] and then he saw a second dream which was
[1:52:06] seven what cow
[1:52:08] both of those dreams were just one drink
[1:52:14] they were saying the same thing but they
[1:52:17] were using two different form
[1:52:22] the first one was using the wheat
[1:52:27] everybody here and the second one uses a
[1:52:30] beast
[1:52:32] everybody here so the wheat plant and
[1:52:35] the beast goes together
[1:52:39] everybody here
[1:52:40] because remember jesus said that he was
[1:52:42] the corn of wheat
[1:52:45] and jesus said except the corn of which
[1:52:47] fall into the ground
[1:52:48] and abide alone and jesus have to fall
[1:52:51] down and when he was erected he came
[1:52:54] back on the day of pentecost as a wit
[1:52:57] and the width begin to go to moving the
[1:53:00] loot the
[1:53:01] castle and the blade and pentecost the
[1:53:04] shark and the water
[1:53:05] one is picking off the church edges
[1:53:08] and one is picking off the water
[1:53:10] the seals
[1:53:13] relax i'm gonna get there
[1:53:15] brother branham says this he said like
[1:53:18] in daniel when he saw a certain nation a
[1:53:21] certain nation rise up it will be maybe
[1:53:24] a bear holding a ring you know what it
[1:53:26] means now in his side in symbol then he
[1:53:29] see another power raise up a goat he
[1:53:31] represents something then he sees
[1:53:33] another power raise up and he was a
[1:53:35] leopard with so many heads you represent
[1:53:38] a certain water now you understand why
[1:53:41] brother branham said that then he saw
[1:53:43] another one rise up a great lion with
[1:53:45] water and stomped the residue that
[1:53:47] represented different power all together
[1:53:50] one was a kingdom of nebuchadnezzar
[1:53:54] and another type of a dream
[1:53:57] daniel saw a vision
[1:53:59] you okay
[1:54:00] nebuchadnezzar dream a dream
[1:54:03] but daniel interpreted his dream and was
[1:54:07] correctly with what
[1:54:10] what are you trying to say amen
[1:54:12] nebuchadnezzar
[1:54:14] saw
[1:54:15] the vision of the kingdom of the gentile
[1:54:19] in the natural aspect
[1:54:25] everybody here
[1:54:27] according to the dream of nebuchadnezzar
[1:54:31] they
[1:54:32] when daniel came in daniel told him that
[1:54:35] you know what everything you saw is four
[1:54:37] kings it's four kingdoms
[1:54:39] amen you are babylon they will come
[1:54:42] another kingdom after you then they will
[1:54:44] come another kingdom after you so
[1:54:46] politically speaking god gave the king
[1:54:49] the natural aspect of what happened in
[1:54:51] the world
[1:54:52] everybody okay
[1:54:54] but when god talked to his prophet
[1:54:57] amen he doesn't give the prophet only
[1:55:00] the natural aspect
[1:55:02] god gave the prophet the spirit behind
[1:55:07] every kingdom
[1:55:09] everybody here in other words daniel saw
[1:55:12] the spiritual aspect
[1:55:15] of the vision
[1:55:17] or the anointing
[1:55:20] amen
[1:55:22] behind the nation
[1:55:24] because everybody got a spirit
[1:55:27] and every mission brother branham say
[1:55:30] have a spirit
[1:55:32] but here if you see something moving a
[1:55:35] certain way there is a spirit behind it
[1:55:38] if you see putin acting the way he's
[1:55:41] acting it is not really putin
[1:55:44] there is a spirit behind putin that is
[1:55:47] making him behave the way he behave
[1:55:50] and there is a spirit behind by then
[1:55:53] that meant by them behave a certain way
[1:55:56] every nation has a
[1:55:58] spirit what you see in the natural sense
[1:56:02] is putin is attacking ukraine
[1:56:05] that's naturally
[1:56:07] but spiritually it means something else
[1:56:10] naturally what do you see is a kingdom
[1:56:13] like gold a kingdom like silver a
[1:56:16] kingdom like iron but what is gold
[1:56:19] meaning
[1:56:20] spiritually speaking that god is a lion
[1:56:24] that silver is a bear
[1:56:27] but here
[1:56:28] the brass is a leopard
[1:56:31] so the power that is moving in the
[1:56:33] kingdom is a different power spiritually
[1:56:36] speaking
[1:56:38] what are you trying to say
[1:56:40] we found out that this tree
[1:56:42] the sea
[1:56:43] filled with water
[1:56:45] got four wings that came in
[1:56:47] and the four winds began to blow
[1:56:50] i know somebody will laugh
[1:56:54] ever here i said the young kid i mean
[1:56:57] the children will be looking at that and
[1:56:59] then and everybody who was sleeping was
[1:57:00] like wake up
[1:57:03] everybody okay so the four weeks begin
[1:57:05] to blow
[1:57:07] what is a wind
[1:57:11] brother branham says this
[1:57:13] he said the four winds
[1:57:15] in the bible means water
[1:57:18] and water
[1:57:20] like in jobs time you remember winds
[1:57:23] came down and took the sun
[1:57:25] you know what it means it means water
[1:57:28] so when they say in the scripture that
[1:57:31] the four winds are hitting the sea
[1:57:34] in other words it's spirit
[1:57:37] following me that are bringing wall
[1:57:40] and trouble
[1:57:43] when you see putin attacking
[1:57:45] it's a wind that is growing
[1:57:49] that's a bible prophetic language
[1:57:52] in a natural language it is war
[1:57:55] in the spiritual language it's a window
[1:57:59] because it's disturbing the water
[1:58:02] are we okay
[1:58:04] do you follow me glory to god brother
[1:58:07] branham say now the angel was standing
[1:58:10] on the four corners of the earth holding
[1:58:13] the water
[1:58:15] what as winds means in the bible
[1:58:17] any new bible interpreter here wings
[1:58:20] means water
[1:58:22] and water and water brother branham gave
[1:58:25] one scripture here a bad job
[1:58:27] do we have another scripture
[1:58:30] if you remember when ezekiel was brought
[1:58:33] to the valley of the valley of
[1:58:37] of the dry bones
[1:58:39] every bones were scattered
[1:58:41] we know the story god came and said son
[1:58:44] of man which had this born lives he said
[1:58:46] you know it god said prophesy when he
[1:58:50] prophesied the bond came together
[1:58:53] that was it god said prophesied the
[1:58:55] second time then he prophesied then the
[1:58:58] sinew came up
[1:59:00] nothing they were still dead then god
[1:59:02] said professor when he professor the
[1:59:04] flesh came up but they were still dead
[1:59:07] they were no life
[1:59:09] god said now you need to prophesy for
[1:59:11] the life
[1:59:12] where is the life coming from
[1:59:14] stay alert the bible says this
[1:59:18] in ezekiel 37 then he said unto me
[1:59:21] prophesy unto the water
[1:59:26] are we okay i'm going slowly you need to
[1:59:29] stay alert
[1:59:30] okay prophesy unto the water
[1:59:33] if you want to give life to somebody why
[1:59:36] do you prophesy about the wind
[1:59:40] and we know the witch means war
[1:59:42] strife or what
[1:59:45] so the life of these
[1:59:49] people
[1:59:50] were taken off by a wall

[2:00:20] water
[2:00:23] we sin in daniel that the four winds
[2:00:28] travel the water
[2:00:31] everybody okay
[2:00:32] and we found out that the lives of these
[2:00:35] people
[2:00:36] were hidden by the four winds
[2:00:42] the bible says
[2:00:44] four weeks do what
[2:00:47] and breathe upon the water
[2:00:49] the slain means they were water
[2:00:52] they were killed underwater

[2:00:56] everybody okay and the wall came and
[2:00:59] killed the people and the wind carried
[2:01:01] there

[2:11:59] are we okay
[2:12:01] are we okay
[2:12:02] are we okay
[2:12:03] in other words the fourth beast
[2:12:07] is a mixture
[2:12:12] of the forerunners
[2:12:16] of the predecessors
[2:12:20] but here that's why when the stone come
[2:12:24] [Music]
[2:12:26] the stone wanna destroy the whole image
[2:12:30] but if you target the lion the bear will
[2:12:34] [Music]
[2:12:35] [Applause]
[2:12:40] will run away
[2:12:42] they don't have to wait
[2:12:44] until they all put themselves together

[2:13:29] look like that
[2:13:33] [Music]
[2:13:35] everybody okay now
[2:13:37] in other words this beast is beast
[2:13:39] number one
[2:13:40] plus number two
[2:13:42] plus number three
[2:13:44] equal number four
[2:13:46] [Music]
[2:13:49] everybody okay
[2:13:50] but there is something brother branham
[2:13:53] says here he said daniel you that the
[2:13:56] marking down daniel 7. daniel saw the
[2:13:59] same vision 800 years before this saw
[2:14:03] the vision he saw those beasts now
[2:14:06] one from water
[2:14:08] in the water
[2:14:09] of the gentile ruling and here they are
[2:14:13] john seeing it
[2:14:14] at the end of the gentile ruling all
[2:14:17] water
[2:14:19] represented in what
[2:14:21] the message perfectly in line with the
[2:14:23] bible
[2:14:24] [Music]
[2:14:26] the same old water
[2:14:28] demon that possessed each water
[2:14:31] of the roman came through the water
[2:14:34] and so forth on down through the gentle
[2:14:36] dispensation has come right down and all
[2:14:39] met up in water
[2:14:40] so when you hit that one beast
[2:14:43] [Music]
[2:14:46] you are consuming everything
[2:14:49] because babylon have become the cage of
[2:14:53] all unclean spirits
[2:14:56] all unclean blood
[2:14:58] hateful all of them are burned all up in
[2:15:01] one place
[2:15:03] remember revelation 18 you remember
[2:15:05] revelation 18
[2:15:07] glory to god
[2:15:08] he says who is he all those leopard lion
[2:15:13] all the dragon how many knows the dragon
[2:15:15] is the dragon represent who
[2:15:17] let's stay there let's continue first
[2:15:19] ever here
[2:15:21] now if you look at the particularity of
[2:15:24] the first beast
[2:15:26] we okay
[2:15:27] we found out that the first beast having
[2:15:30] an ego's wing
[2:15:32] anybody care
[2:15:33] and at the beginning he have an ego
[2:15:36] wings with a heart of a beast
[2:15:39] but later on the wings of the ego were
[2:15:42] removed
[2:15:43] when he was removed ever here then the
[2:15:47] beast stood like a man
[2:15:48] and he became human
[2:15:52] everybody okay
[2:15:53] and we know that the beginning of this
[2:15:56] kingdom the bible says that daniel told
[2:15:59] king nebuchadnezzar that king
[2:16:01] nebuchadnezzar the head of god was you
[2:16:04] so nebuchadnezzar
[2:16:07] was the head of gold
[2:16:10] and the power behind nebuchadnezzar
[2:16:15] ever here was a lion
[2:16:18] with an eagle wings
[2:16:22] everybody here
[2:16:24] but there is something strange about
[2:16:26] nebuchadnezzar
[2:16:28] let's look at the scripture
[2:16:30] the bible says in jeremiah 27
[2:16:33] and now have i given all this land
[2:16:37] into the hand of who
[2:16:39] nebuchadnezzar the king of who

[2:16:56] if i said brother branham said then you
[2:16:58] would say where is the scripture i give
[2:16:59] you the scripture
[2:17:04] so now can that's how i was true
[2:17:08] let me continue
[2:17:10] anybody okay
[2:17:12] can i add something nebuchadnezzar
[2:17:16] work with daniel
[2:17:17] [Music]
[2:17:22] he works with a prophet
[2:17:28] his kingdom
[2:17:30] was a kingdom that was connected with a
[2:17:33] prophet
[2:17:34] [Music]
[2:17:37] when nebuchadnezzar had trouble
[2:17:40] they said god come meet that daniel
[2:17:43] that daniel that came from the land of
[2:17:45] judah dania come here this is my dream
[2:17:48] and daniel will look and say this is
[2:17:50] what it means this is what it means this
[2:17:52] is what he meant and he finished he
[2:17:53] turned around he goes back
[2:17:57] daniel was employee
[2:18:00] in the government of nebuchadnezzar
[2:18:04] if you don't know that raise your hand
[2:18:06] it is written in your bible
[2:18:12] when they give them a test
[2:18:14] because they stuck straight with the
[2:18:17] message of the hour
[2:18:18] god gave them wisdom
[2:18:21] above everybody
[2:18:23] and when they went to the test
[2:18:25] the eog
[2:18:27] of the state
[2:18:29] they have so many points
[2:18:32] higher point compared to all the
[2:18:34] children
[2:18:36] it is written in your bible
[2:18:38] and they give them big position
[2:18:41] in the government
[2:18:43] it was a government
[2:18:45] that was controlled by godly people
[2:18:51] [Music]

[2:24:06] lord by demand for fool
[2:24:09] until the land has enjoyed water
[2:24:13] the problem is with the sabbath
[2:24:16] of the land
[2:24:17] remember we are deep in the holiest

[2:25:21] ironer
[2:25:24] everybody okay
[2:25:25] and that lion have ego wings

[2:26:03] do you remember caneza one time
[2:26:07] he was up he tried to be a big shot
[2:26:10] do you remember god sent daniel
[2:26:15] and put a whooping on nebuchadnezzar
[2:26:19] and guess what he made nebuchadnezzar go
[2:26:22] in the field and eat grass like an ox
[2:26:26] until nebuchadnezzar came back and said
[2:26:28] i recognize you to be the king of heaven
[2:26:31] you the god of heaven because the eagle
[2:26:34] which was there
[2:26:36] he was maintaining the lion
[2:26:38] [Music]
[2:26:41] but there will come a time when the ego
[2:26:44] wins will be

[2:28:40] middle will kill
[2:28:42] and the middle came to kill under
[2:28:44] belthazar

[2:28:48] the two
[2:28:50] because there is two kings
[2:28:51] do you remember he must be the son of
[2:28:54] nebuchadnezzar and the grandson of damn

[2:29:49] verse 27. if you there you can say amen
[2:29:52] and he came to pass in the seventh and
[2:29:55] thirtieth years of captivity of the

[2:30:03] 12th month on the 7th and 12th 20th day
[2:30:07] of the mount that who
[2:30:10] evil merodak
[2:30:13] king of water
[2:30:15] in the year that he begin to do water
[2:30:18] did lift up the head of jehoiachin king
[2:30:21] of judah out of water so after
[2:30:23] nabuchadnezzar the one that followed him
[2:30:25] was evil merudick
[2:30:28] and the one that followed evil merodak
[2:30:30] was beltaza
[2:30:33] everybody okay
[2:30:35] now let's go to daniel 5. so we clear
[2:30:37] that up
[2:30:39] we cannot leave any shadow now
[2:30:42] no more game
[2:30:44] everybody okay
[2:30:45] it's a message of precision
[2:30:47] [Music]
[2:30:49] that's why brother branham when he gives
[2:30:50] the discernment precision
[2:30:52] it's no more game
[2:30:54] he's gone get the trouble brother i'm
[2:30:56] saying my gun have to be shooting booze
[2:30:58] he said god created you like that so
[2:31:00] that he doesn't play a game with even
[2:31:03] compromising i mean a small edge he must
[2:31:06] be all the time bullseye
[2:31:09] because it's a message of perfection
[2:31:12] bertasa the king made a great feast
[2:31:16] to a thousand of his lord and he did
[2:31:18] what
[2:31:19] remember in revelation
[2:31:21] uh 18
[2:31:23] they drank wine of the fornication the
[2:31:26] wine of babylon have a problem let's see
[2:31:29] what the one is going to do to beltaza
[2:31:32] when he drug one before the thousand
[2:31:35] watch verse two beltaza while he did
[2:31:37] what
[2:31:39] not when he eat the meat but the wine
[2:31:42] it's the one of babylon when he tasted
[2:31:45] the wine
[2:31:46] he commanded to bring the golden and
[2:31:49] silver vessel which his father water
[2:31:52] when they say father doesn't mean he was
[2:31:55] born from him because when god met jacob
[2:31:58] he said your father abraham abraham was
[2:32:02] not the direct father of jacob
[2:32:05] okay
[2:32:06] he was a grandfather so you need to
[2:32:08] understand that language
[2:32:10] just to lock those questions
[2:32:13] yes okay the vessel of your father
[2:32:15] nebuchadnezzar has taken out of the
[2:32:17] temple which was in water so there was
[2:32:20] something about this wine
[2:32:22] that as soon as the one got there
[2:32:24] it directed this man to go play with the
[2:32:27] staff of god
[2:32:28] what was in this wine
[2:32:31] everybody here
[2:32:32] which in jerusalem that the king and

[2:32:38] concubine might drink there in the holy
[2:32:40] vessels of god when somebody get inside
[2:32:43] they kill him
[2:32:45] then they brought the golden vessel that
[2:32:48] were taken out of the temple of the
[2:32:50] house of god which was in jerusalem and
[2:32:52] the king and his princes his wife and
[2:32:55] his conqueror drunk in them they drank

[2:46:30] but with a human heart
[2:46:33] with a human water

[2:46:38] a human being
[2:46:40] amen

[2:47:30] is finally he's incarnate in a what
[2:47:34] then he's what
[2:47:36] brother branham said when he received
[2:47:38] the crown
[2:47:39] is when the spirit was incarnate
[2:47:42] into a man

[2:51:55] as a chess virgin to who
[2:51:58] by but i feel less water
[2:52:01] began water
[2:52:02] through water
[2:52:04] where is the serpent
[2:52:08] we saw the serpent at the beginning and
[2:52:10] we know that in the beginning we know
[2:52:12] that in the beginning the serpent was a
[2:52:15] beast in the garden of eden but at the
[2:52:17] end the serpent is water
[2:52:20] we already seen the purple incarnated
[2:52:23] and he is also water
[2:52:27] let me jump this and not stop
[2:52:29] you ready
[2:52:31] the beginning is water

[2:52:35] and after the business follow up and
[2:52:37] after woman follow up and after came
[2:52:39] forward
[2:52:40] but in here we find that nebuchadnezzar
[2:52:43] started like a lion with ego when you
[2:52:46] take the ego it's incarnation
[2:52:49] when paul started with the church no
[2:52:52] problem in the church
[2:52:54] you remember but when they kill paul
[2:52:59] after my departure
[2:53:03] after my departure after the wings are
[2:53:06] [Music]
[2:53:08] taken everybody okay
[2:53:11] everybody okay
[2:53:12] they will come water
[2:53:14] and guess what later on
[2:53:16] a man was incarnated
[2:53:18] everybody care
[2:53:20] everybody okay so far
[2:53:21] the anointing that was with paul
[2:53:24] was a lion anointing for the entire age
[2:53:31] everybody okay
[2:53:32] everybody okay
[2:53:33] in other words the entire age was under
[2:53:36] a lion
[2:53:38] but babylon is also a lion
[2:53:43] everybody okay
[2:53:44] to control the lion you need the ego
[2:53:47] wings
[2:53:50] everybody okay
[2:53:51] everybody okay so the eagle wings must
[2:53:53] be always present
[2:53:56] anybody okay in order to control the
[2:53:58] lion if you take the eagle wings off the
[2:54:01] lion is incarnated in a human being
[2:54:05] [Music]
[2:54:07] everybody okay
[2:54:08] everybody okay everybody okay but here
[2:54:12] the age
[2:54:14] the believer were only under the
[2:54:16] anointing of a lion
[2:54:22] everybody okay
[2:54:24] the prophet was a message the messenger
[2:54:28] was a prophet but the age was a lion
[2:54:35] everybody okay
[2:54:36] so when the prophet goes out
[2:54:41] everybody okay
[2:54:43] the age remain and the lion
[2:54:46] all they can do is fight
[2:54:50] but they cannot control babylon
[2:54:56] are you following me they can continue
[2:54:58] to fight
[2:55:00] with a lion anointing but babylon is
[2:55:03] already free
[2:55:04] [Music]
[2:55:07] the neglect and spirit begin to work and
[2:55:09] he moved until he became the throne of
[2:55:11] satan go through the church ages you're
[2:55:14] gonna see that amen because eden is now
[2:55:17] open
[2:55:19] remember the last words rather his name
[2:55:22] was what
[2:55:24] the tree of death was there
[2:55:26] if the tree of death is there in the
[2:55:28] church ages we must have the tree of
[2:55:30] life open revelation too and i stop here
[2:55:38] i can't take you where i want it to be
[2:55:41] because it's now if i take you i'm gonna
[2:55:43] take him on two hours we gotta stop and
[2:55:45] let you chew throughout the week
[2:55:49] everybody okay
[2:55:50] go to revelation chapter two and then
[2:55:52] i'll end
[2:55:54] okay
[2:55:54] so this is a different it's uh it's an
[2:55:56] airfly
[2:55:58] airplane for fight
[2:56:00] so the landing is also different
[2:56:02] okay my friend
[2:56:04] all right
[2:56:05] so keep
[2:56:06] everything you got a helmet and
[2:56:07] everything because we can flip okay
[2:56:10] verse one to the angel of the church of
[2:56:13] water
[2:56:14] which church is it
[2:56:17] the church the first church the name is
[2:56:19] ephesus which is power okay
[2:56:22] job to verse 7
[2:56:24] the reward of the people from ephesus
[2:56:27] he that has an ear let him hear what the
[2:56:30] spirit says unto the water
[2:56:32] to him the water
[2:56:34] will i give to eat of water
[2:56:36] [Music]
[2:56:38] of water
[2:56:41] the water
[2:56:43] we are back again at the beginning
[2:56:46] now in the church we have the tree of
[2:56:49] life
[2:56:50] he's back again and the tree of what
[2:56:53] the knowledge of good and evil the two
[2:56:55] trees are back again
[2:56:57] that's why paul said i feel
[2:57:00] because what happened in eden
[2:57:02] is coming back again in the church
[2:57:06] everybody okay now everybody okay now so
[2:57:09] in order to control babylon you need to
[2:57:13] have the eagle wings
[2:57:15] but the only god wins for the edge
[2:57:19] in emphasis
[2:57:21] that was the messenger the top they were
[2:57:24] under other prophets like agabus and the
[2:57:26] other one but they were not at the
[2:57:28] caliber of paul
[2:57:30] because paul was the messenger so paul
[2:57:32] being the messenger remember paul saw
[2:57:35] the antichrist
[2:57:36] and he said i see what happened in eden
[2:57:39] it's about to happen now now i'm fearing
[2:57:42] because i'm trying everything i can to
[2:57:44] keep the church virgin to present you to
[2:57:47] jesus christ but i know after my
[2:57:49] departure
[2:57:51] when they plug the winds of the ego
[2:57:54] everybody okay babylon will be again
[2:57:57] water
[2:57:59] will be free
[2:58:00] let me stop here we will continue
[2:58:02] where am i going to stop
[2:58:04] the age of ephesus
[2:58:06] have they lie on anointing
[2:58:09] amen the prophetic powerful anointing
[2:58:12] was on power when paul is removed
[2:58:15] the prophet that remained a man
[2:58:18] they are not strong enough to fight
[2:58:20] babylon then babylon progress multiply
[2:58:24] and take the church and darkness begin
[2:58:25] to get an entity and jezebel is sitting
[2:58:29] in the church
[2:58:30] because the wings of the ego has been
[2:58:33] watered
[2:58:34] but in the last age
[2:58:40] cannot continue
[2:58:42] can i continue
[2:58:44] they are knocking of the edge
[2:58:47] is an eagle anointing
[2:58:53] everybody okay
[2:58:55] and the messenger is an ego
[2:58:57] you can take the messenger away
[2:59:00] but the illegal anointing
[2:59:03] [Applause]
[2:59:05] is still controlling babylon
[2:59:09] hallelujah
[2:59:11] hallelujah
[2:59:12] hallelujah that's why in revelation 10
[2:59:17] when he's coming down
[2:59:20] [Music]
[2:59:23] ever here
[2:59:24] he's controlling babylon
[2:59:27] because it's what
[2:59:29] in other words even power
[2:59:32] according to paul if i go away i'm
[2:59:36] afraid but according to william marion
[2:59:38] pranam i must decrease
[2:59:42] so that he can watch him
[2:59:44] and even if he drove
[2:59:46] the pillar of fire
[2:59:49] the unknown
[2:59:50] is still there the wings of the ego are
[2:59:54] still protecting
[2:59:55] and covering babylon let's stand my
[2:59:58] friend
[2:59:59] let's stand my friend
[3:00:01] [Applause]
[3:00:05] glory to god
[3:00:13] everybody here
[3:00:14] the edge is under the ingo wings
[3:00:17] there's nothing babylon will do
[3:00:19] that's why brother branham said we have
[3:00:21] the devil answer
[3:00:24] you can leave this message
[3:00:27] it doesn't do anything
[3:00:28] you can create a built-in move you won't
[3:00:31] do anything the election will not be
[3:00:34] deceived
[3:00:36] [Applause]
[3:00:37] the elect will not be deceived
[3:00:40] because the knowledge is under the equal
[3:00:43] anointing
[3:00:44] [Applause]
[3:00:47] buddy
[3:00:49] listen to me
[3:00:51] go home
[3:00:52] replay this
[3:00:54] go over again
[3:00:55] so next time because i'm gonna use the
[3:00:57] same airplane
[3:00:59] i have to shoot with it everybody okay
[3:01:01] and you're gonna see what he does with
[3:01:03] the ego wings let's pray heavenly father
[3:01:06] lord we are approaching you again humbly
[3:01:09] father this morning lord thanking you
[3:01:11] for your grace
[3:01:34] often
[3:01:35] we have the master himself
[3:01:38] that is right in the midst of us
[3:01:41] and that's no wonder
[3:01:43] you can say fear not little brother
[3:01:46] because you knew what you put in this
[3:01:48] brand
[3:01:50] babylon can continue to rather
[3:01:53] but we are not of this world
[3:01:56] we don't even belong in laodicea
[3:01:59] we are all the way in the broad age now
[3:02:02] we are separated like in goshen
[3:02:05] where everything is under control
[3:02:08] father may you help your children
[3:02:11] if there is nobody here
[3:02:15] or someone
[3:02:16] that have not gotten the second oil yet
[3:02:20] that maybe was stuck
[3:02:21] [Music]
[3:02:23] in the water
[3:02:24] or stuck by the blood
[3:02:27] but lord never the spirit father may you
[3:02:30] be merciful unto them
[3:02:32] that you can move them to that third
[3:02:34] stage
[3:02:35] where they can have the oil
[3:02:38] because without the soil
[3:02:41] it is not the
[3:02:42] festoid it is the second oil
[3:02:46] it is the oil of christ
[3:02:48] it is the oil of wisdom
[3:02:51] it is the oil of mystery
[3:02:53] and it's that all that can control
[3:02:56] babylon
[3:02:57] even though the prophet is no longer on
[3:02:59] the scene
[3:03:01] father we are not like those of paul
[3:03:04] and you even say lord father that we're
[3:03:06] not really going back to that
[3:03:08] because we are more than poor
[3:03:10] we have paul plus the capstone prophetic
[3:03:12] ministry
[3:03:14] further appropriate
[3:03:16] to break the image
[3:03:18] completely in every form
[3:03:21] the capstone will destroy it
[3:03:23] because you prove
[3:03:25] that you waited until the enemy can be
[3:03:28] combined into one beast so that you can
[3:03:31] destroy him one time
[3:03:33] and further we are in the edge
[3:03:35] that the enemies combine into one
[3:03:38] horseradish and father you send the
[3:03:41] capstone ministry
[3:03:42] because you knew that that is the
[3:03:44] prescription that would take care of the
[3:03:47] devil in all form of aspect
[3:03:50] father may you open the revelation to
[3:03:52] your children may they realize that
[3:03:54] seriousness of the hour
[3:03:56] and may those that are struggling even
[3:03:59] just to come to church
[3:04:01] father be merciful to them
[3:04:03] shake their way shake their eyes
[3:04:06] shake their heart from defeats of the
[3:04:09] world
[3:04:10] from whatever is showing them away from
[3:04:12] the church
[3:04:13] [Music]
[3:04:14] because the hour is late
[3:04:17] and father may you continue with your
[3:04:18] children continue to unfold your word
[3:04:21] continue to keep them consecrated
[3:04:24] continue to let them lord go back and
[3:04:26] read this scripture read daniel read all
[3:04:29] these things lord so that you can afford
[3:04:32] them more
[3:04:33] than what we can see here lord
[3:04:35] father we ask you everything and we
[3:04:37] thank you may you touch the sick and
[3:04:40] those that are suffering and if somebody
[3:04:42] came with a need father may you give it
[3:04:44] to them according to the bead lord in
[3:04:47] the name of jesus christ
[3:04:49] amen
[3:04:50] god bless you church we love you thank
[3:04:52] you for the sacrifice god bless you
[3:04:53] great job
