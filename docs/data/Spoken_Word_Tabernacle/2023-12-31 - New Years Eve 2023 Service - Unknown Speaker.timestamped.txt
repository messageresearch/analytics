[0:00] the wise man as you heard in my last
[0:01] message how that God dealt with the wise
[0:05] man and in the day that he he turned him
[0:10] aside by a dream and he told Joseph by a
[0:12] dream how to take care of the welfare of
[0:14] his own son because he had the dream
[0:17] there was a dream is secondarily
[0:19] something off to one side because people
[0:21] can have dreams that's not right but
[0:23] there was no prophet in the land in that
[0:25] day there was no Prophet therefore God
[0:28] had to use what he had to use with and
[0:30] teaches us that that God can use every
[0:33] faculty and everything that we do if
[0:34] it's consecrated to him but it first
[0:37] must be consecrated to him let your your
[0:40] meditations which really reflects your
[0:42] dream see because it's your
[0:44] subconscious if you watch a dream you'll
[0:46] see that's something you've been
[0:47] thinking of or something like that
[0:48] usually you see and let your mind be on
[0:51] God then see so it reflects something
[0:53] for him and whatever you are uh let it
[0:56] reflect him
[0:58] now in the heaven
[1:01] above did you notice I'm looking on this
[1:03] the
[1:04] um the light on the picture there out of
[1:07] the Life magazine that uh the brother
[1:10] lives here in his home has um uh put on
[1:14] his
[1:15] wall uh that triangle uh
[1:20] light I just happened to run across my
[1:22] mind if any of you has the Lums of Bible
[1:26] translation if you'll notice over the
[1:28] cover of it is a tri
[1:31] trinitarian light a three cornered light
[1:35] like a
[1:36] Halo and um when Dr LSA friend my
[1:41] personal friend was translating the
[1:42] Bible that is the old Hebrew symbol of
[1:48] God in the true trinitarian way that he
[1:52] is not three
[1:53] Gods but three manifestations of the
[1:58] same God father Son and Holy Spirit the
[2:01] light is one complete circle

[1:10:13] continue to
[1:10:14] grow and I say to you young men that's
[1:10:17] why you keep hearing me say my you need
[1:10:20] to get into the position yes sir okay
[1:10:23] came because the Lord he's doing such
[1:10:26] great things and you know in obedience
[1:10:29] you rather be obedient and move to the
[1:10:32] voice of the god to the Lord than rather
[1:10:34] for the Lord to have to move you in that
[1:10:37] position is that right remember Jonah
[1:10:40] Jonah was giving a message and Jonah had
[1:10:43] to cry out and God give us a message you
[1:10:47] know and you catch those those those
[1:10:49] nuggets and it give you an opportunity
[1:10:51] to go out and help someone else amen you
[1:10:54] know and you'll see by the grace of God
[1:10:56] uh just a little thought the Lord put on
[1:10:58] our heart our hearts and mind are clear
[1:11:01] yes sir let us pray Lord God we thank
[1:11:03] you for your grace your mercy we thank
[1:11:05] you for this opportunity so Lord God
[1:11:07] bless your people and those had a desire
[1:11:09] to be here and not able to be here we
[1:11:11] thank you in Jesus name we pray amen and
[1:11:14] amen let's go to Psalms and brother Tim
[1:11:17] he said that but I I'm going with the
[1:11:19] pastor if I would have known you was
[1:11:21] here you'll be here huh
[1:11:25] huh but uh I guess the lot has fell this
[1:11:28] way here tonight right so we thank the
[1:11:31] Lord for the opportunity and we're not
[1:11:34] planning to do a whole lot of preaching
[1:11:37] just share a little thought with you
[1:11:39] that was on our hearts Psalms
[1:11:42] 133 once you have it you can say amen
[1:11:45] amen
[1:11:47] hallelujah still here the pages turning
[1:11:51] you know when I seen our our our sister
[1:11:53] gift sing that song and right at the end
[1:11:56] it was a part of that song it said let
[1:11:58] us come together am and uh so uh that's
[1:12:02] what we kind of just looking at tonight
[1:12:05] thought in Psalms
[1:12:07] 133 it says behold how good and pleasant
[1:12:11] it is for Brethren to dwell together in
[1:12:15] unity it is like the precious you may be
[1:12:18] seated it's like the precious ointment
[1:12:21] upon the head and rain down upon the
[1:12:24] beard even Aaron's beard that went down
[1:12:28] through the skirts of of his garments as
[1:12:31] the de of Herman and as the de that
[1:12:33] descended upon the mountains of Zion for
[1:12:36] there the Lord commanded the blessings
[1:12:39] even life forever
[1:12:41] more you know you come and you see we
[1:12:44] don't fully know what the Lord have for
[1:12:47] us along the way he just opens things up
[1:12:53] but he shares with us the honor I mean
[1:12:57] the honor that we have the position that
[1:12:59] we have through the ministry that he
[1:13:02] sense you know the reason why you hear
[1:13:04] me say these things and I say it humbly
[1:13:07] and in love because at times you know
[1:13:10] you still going this way and some of you
[1:13:13] get that old Parable say you can't teach
[1:13:15] your old dog new tricks throw that out
[1:13:17] the window okay throw it on out the
[1:13:19] window right because God has time he
[1:13:23] didn't he didn't start dealing with
[1:13:24] Moses until he was 80 years old right so
[1:13:28] you know you might as well forget about
[1:13:29] me getting no I'm not old yet is that
[1:13:31] right because God still got a word for
[1:13:34] me is that right he sent me up in a
[1:13:37] position because he's not finished so I
[1:13:40] got a pastor that can help teach me and
[1:13:43] help me along the way is that right
[1:13:46] because that's what the prophet of God
[1:13:47] said you just follow him along the way
[1:13:50] Paul said follow me as I follow Christ
[1:13:53] because we may see see that's why I said
[1:13:55] let's come together we may look at
[1:13:58] things different we may see something
[1:14:01] that's a little rough maybe we can't put
[1:14:03] up with but the pastor is looking beyond
[1:14:06] that is that right because God put him a
[1:14:09] gift in each and every that gift in him
[1:14:13] to recognize the sheep that he sent
[1:14:15] among us so we want to look at just some
[1:14:19] of the quotes here we just wanted to
[1:14:21] read tonight by by the grace of God you
[1:14:24] know here in the message brother Brandon

[1:15:22] when you singing you Worship You
[1:15:24] worshiping him he's pleased he's thank
[1:15:27] you he's worthy that's what he put us
[1:15:29] here for right to worship him to praise
[1:15:33] him give him glory give him honor that's
[1:15:36] what he said because he's a great God

[1:17:04] where as the psalm said behold how sweet
[1:17:09] and pleasant for Brethren to dwell
[1:17:12] together in unity amen it's like the
[1:17:16] anointing the anointing oil that was on
[1:17:19] Aaron's beard yes sir and that ran to
[1:17:22] the hyns of his garments remember what
[1:17:24] the pro remember what the prophet of God
[1:17:26] said at the end of those garments was
[1:17:31] pomegranat that's what the Holy Spirit
[1:17:33] was saying the other day there's no way
[1:17:35] in his presence you could just sit there
[1:17:38] no sir there's no way in his presence
[1:17:41] you just sit there because you know when
[1:17:44] you in his presence is what it's plenty
[1:17:46] noise is that right he said when Aaron
[1:17:49] went them presence in the presence of
[1:17:51] the Lord those dragans they just started
[1:17:54] singing a tune is that right making a
[1:17:57] tune because they was in his presence

[1:18:04] presence it's Deliverance in his
[1:18:06] presence it's comfort in his presence
[1:18:09] Revelation in his presence you're in his
[1:18:13] presence am he says which that anointing
[1:18:17] oil you know what the anointing oil done
[1:18:21] right it Preserve served him to go in
[1:18:24] the presence of God see he had to be
[1:18:29] Anointed with that oil before he went
[1:18:32] into the presence of God Amen and went
[1:18:36] bre when Brethren can dwell together in
[1:18:39] unity uhoh you see what he was saying
[1:18:43] that's why the sister was singing that
[1:18:45] song I put D up under my feet I put lion
[1:18:49] up under my feet I put backbiting up
[1:18:52] under my feet
[1:18:53] okay I put hypocrisy up under my feet
[1:18:56] we're moving into a new year we what
[1:18:59] we're pressing to the mark of the pride
[1:19:01] of the high calling as Paul said
[1:19:04] forgetting those things of the past but

[1:19:09] High Calling is that right

[1:19:20] oil done it preserved him to go into the
[1:19:22] presence of God see he had to be
[1:19:25] Anointed with that oil before he went
[1:19:28] into the presence of God and when
[1:19:30] brother can dwell together in unity is
[1:19:33] like unto the what that oil see we we
[1:19:37] then enter into the presence of the Lord
[1:19:41] with that anointing of Brethren together
[1:19:43] in unity oil represents what the holy
[1:19:48] spirit is that right that's what Jesus
[1:19:50] was saying the spirit of the Lord is
[1:19:52] upon me and he has anointed me to do

[1:41:32] have to understand that Fellowship he
[1:41:35] had confidence with job because he said
[1:41:38] the only things reason why those things
[1:41:41] Came Upon job brother Brandon says

[1:41:53] confidence in job cuz he had fellowship
[1:41:55] with job let me keep going help me Lord
[1:41:59] he said now look he said the minister
[1:42:01] must have Fellowship he cannot draw a
[1:42:04] denomination to burier in the house of
[1:42:06] God you cannot say this church belongs
[1:42:09] to the Presbyterian this place belongs
[1:42:11] to Methodist or the Baptist or the
[1:42:13] Pentecostals or whatever it must be the
[1:42:15] open house for every that's been
[1:42:18] separated from his sins and filled with
[1:42:21] the spirit and with with the spirit can
[1:42:25] have the gladness of The Fellowship of
[1:42:28] the oil of the Lord amen oh what a place
[1:42:32] to worship amen you see so he's telling
[1:42:35] us now running all the way down to every
[1:42:38] denomination to every brother that's
[1:42:40] born in the spirit freely coming into
[1:42:42] the house Aaron standing anointed Jesus
[1:42:46] stands the anointed one amen this
[1:42:48] evening to fellowship with you with you
[1:42:52] Church of God am Christ is here he says
[1:42:55] you telling the other on whoever that's
[1:42:58] come By the Waters of separation and
[1:43:01] recognize the blood and been Sanctified
[1:43:05] and baptized into the body I don't care
[1:43:08] what brain he said you're Sons and
[1:43:11] Daughters of God and have a right to
[1:43:14] Fellowship because you've come through
[1:43:17] amen he said but the holy spirit will
[1:43:19] bring you in to Fellowship that's of God
[1:43:23] Amen let me look at one more by the
[1:43:26] grace of God I think with 3 1160 I
[1:43:29] believe it was Hallelujah help me Lord
[1:43:33] yes he says but this little verse
[1:43:35] paragraph 26 is in the message Mary
[1:43:38] Bel but little Mary takes it takes from
[1:43:43] Nazareth up until the hills of Judea up
[1:43:46] over that rough pass I guess brother
[1:43:49] arganbright who traveled that path a few
[1:43:51] a few weeks ago up over over that Hill
[1:43:54] into Judea to meet her to meet her
[1:43:57] cousins to enjoy Fellowship together
[1:44:00] because God had overshadowed both of
[1:44:03] them what a privilege see when you are
[1:44:06] the same like Kindred of the same faith
[1:44:09] of the same family we can sit there in
[1:44:11] Fellowship around what around the word
[1:44:13] of God is that right because we're being
[1:44:16] brought in under the same message is
[1:44:18] that right help me Lord he said now he
[1:44:21] says in the past over the weeks he said
[1:44:23] they can have Fellowship God had
[1:44:25] overshadowed both of them he said what a
[1:44:28] privilege it is for Brethren to dwell
[1:44:30] together in unity amen it's like the
[1:44:33] anointing that was on Aaron's bear that
[1:44:35] run all the way to the hymns of his
[1:44:38] skirt when people together can agree
[1:44:41] upon God yes sir still being God Amen
[1:44:45] huh God still being God now you know God
[1:44:49] that's why he was sh shing with us this
[1:44:51] this morning a wonderful message the
[1:44:53] Holy Spirit brought down is that right
[1:44:56] he's showing us the authority and hunger
[1:44:59] you got to first Hunger and thirst after
[1:45:02] righteousness to what to be filled is
[1:45:05] that right I'm praying the ones that's
[1:45:07] not I'm going keep praying and ask God
[1:45:10] to bring it to my remembrance cuz we
[1:45:12] can't go nowhere without you is that
[1:45:15] right huh and then you start hungering
[1:45:17] and thirsting for it we all get on one
[1:45:20] mind one Accord we can go he said now
[1:45:23] look what a privilege it is to Brothers
[1:45:26] to be come together in unity he said
[1:45:28] like running down Aaron's beer knowing
[1:45:30] that God is God he said God is just as
[1:45:33] great as he ever was and can assemble
[1:45:37] themselves together and worship God in
[1:45:40] spirit amen see he's saying spirit it's
[1:45:43] not just the word in this hour it's the
[1:45:45] manifestation of the word that's why
[1:45:48] when you tell your testimonies you tell
[1:45:51] your testimonies with joy you see God is
[1:45:54] a God opens doors amen that's why when I
[1:45:58] come I say those things humbly I know
[1:46:01] what I'm getting out of the storehouse
[1:46:03] here is that right then it may it allows
[1:46:07] me to go on my mission sometimes and
[1:46:10] sometimes you don't want to it's
[1:46:12] probably my fault because I don't come
[1:46:14] and tell the testimonies sometime I be
[1:46:17] moving I go Minister four times a week
[1:46:20] and the pastor don't don't know that I'm
[1:46:22] never telling them no that's why you
[1:46:24] young men I'll be praying you need to
[1:46:26] get up and move amen okay amen because
[1:46:29] the Harvest is plenty right and the
[1:46:31] labor is a few amen and when I have
[1:46:34] those meetings a special meeting in the
[1:46:36] pr in the Lord I Shar a short quick
[1:46:39] testimony with you and brother Steve
[1:46:41] they don't know really what God has
[1:46:43] given me here I cannot go in those
[1:46:45] institutions with just
[1:46:48] 99% you see what I'm saying no no no
[1:46:52] those religious demons will look through
[1:46:55] you that's what he was saying glory be
[1:46:57] to God they can't touch this because
[1:47:01] brother every that 20% was saved for us
[1:47:05] it filled every crack in Luther it
[1:47:08] filled every crack in Wesley it filled
[1:47:11] every crack in Paul's Ministry it filled
[1:47:14] every crack in the Pentecostals now
[1:47:16] we're in the bride age uh so no demon
[1:47:19] can get through this because it's Christ
[1:47:22] you understand we had a testimony last
[1:47:26] week talked to a pastor he been out
[1:47:28] there 40 years he's over prison and one
[1:47:31] and the Lord we were just riding in he

[1:49:10] I didn't want to arrest the testimony
[1:49:12] because you hear so much of the
[1:49:15] negativity right and when you hear that
[1:49:17] but then when we bring back that good
[1:49:20] report and that's what we're bringing we
[1:49:23] bringing them now a good report because
[1:49:26] we have to bring them up to the message
[1:49:29] of the hour they got to get the message
[1:49:32] of the hour so that's why I said I
[1:49:35] desire your prayers because when you go
[1:49:37] in those you're dealing with a lot of
[1:49:39] religious demons and when you in there
[1:49:42] and those demons but we had a brother
[1:49:44] that he got he he he robbed the guy
[1:49:47] right and he got there he was in Georgia
[1:49:50] and this young man while he was in there
[1:49:54] he got his life straight and when he got
[1:49:57] his life straight he come in there he he
[1:50:00] he said he was going to go to school he
[1:50:02] went to school he came out he went to
[1:50:04] Benedict College in Columbia South
[1:50:07] Carolina and after we got his his his
[1:50:10] his uh degree in criminal
[1:50:13] justice he's now a prosecutor on the on
[1:50:17] fton County police force and the
[1:50:20] gentleman that he robbed came unto his
[1:50:23] inauguration so we're just sharing these
[1:50:26] testimonies that sometime that's the
[1:50:29] Avenue God have to send some of them to
[1:50:32] go that route to get them straightened
[1:50:34] out that's right so we're saying you're
[1:50:36] not saying publicizing it but if you let
[1:50:39] us know privately because we had loved
[1:50:42] ones that struggled and they have to go
[1:50:45] that route sometimes but sometimes we
[1:50:48] can reach them and get a word to them
[1:50:51] and let them know that the Lord Jesus
[1:50:53] still loved them and they can set them
[1:50:55] free and the Lord is able to um fill
[1:50:58] them with the Holy Spirit and use them
[1:51:00] while they're in there let me keep going
[1:51:03] God help me we coming to the end he said
[1:51:05] now look yes he says uh what at 6311
[1:51:10] help me right he says now God still God
[1:51:14] God is just as great as he ever and can
[1:51:16] assemble themselves together and worship
[1:51:19] God God in spirit Mary wanted a
[1:51:22] fellowship there's no need of going down
[1:51:25] to the synagogue because they didn't
[1:51:27] believe she went to somebody that had an
[1:51:31] experiences like she had and she went
[1:51:34] there to Fellowship so her way she went
[1:51:38] to somebody that believed was still just
[1:51:41] as great as he ever was the only one we
[1:51:46] can take him to what is the Lord is that
[1:51:48] right let's go to R Romans 12 and my
[1:51:50] time is just about up
[1:51:56] Hallelujah we got Romans 12
[1:52:00] and10 help me he
[1:52:04] says he says be Romans

[1:52:10] amen with brotherly love amen in honor
[1:52:14] preferring one another amen not slowful

[1:52:21] things pertaining to brother Robert and
[1:52:23] the pastor and them don't let the devil
[1:52:25] mess with your mind saying it's flattery
[1:52:27] and things in that nature no no no no
[1:52:29] you don't know what they really go
[1:52:32] through you don't understand the depths
[1:52:34] of of of of those things so you just
[1:52:37] keep them in prayer you know God God
[1:52:40] built them that way God made them that
[1:52:42] way but they still need some words of
[1:52:45] comfort at times am look what he says he
[1:52:48] says now he said not slowful verse 11
[1:52:51] not slowful in what business fervent in
[1:52:54] what serving serving the what the Lord
[1:52:58] now you see why some now you now you

[2:21:43] he we want God to send us
[2:21:46] rain
[2:21:48] God need to send us when in the
[2:21:51] [Music]
[2:21:53] season God inhabited the
[2:21:57] Praises that's why we
[2:21:59] [Music]
[2:22:01] read if there is a family that does not
[2:22:05] go up to
[2:22:07] Jerusalem worship and then to bow down
[2:22:10] before the
[2:22:13] king God will not send rain upon the
[2:22:17] family amen
[2:22:19] amen in other
[2:22:23] word if a family doesn't go up to
[2:22:26] worship
[2:22:28] God God will not send the blessing of
[2:22:31] rain upon that family
[2:22:35] amen God will not send the blessing of
[2:22:41] Joy no matter the place of or the
[2:22:43] Wilderness you you are going through
[2:22:50] no matter the situation that you're
[2:22:54] facing God is more than
[2:22:59] able if you only start to worship
[2:23:03] him to praise
[2:23:06] him and to clapping your hand clap your
[2:23:09] hand and as you clap in your
[2:23:12] hand it will it will begin to create
[2:23:16] vapor
[2:23:17] he will create an invisible
[2:23:21] vapor and this is what we're trying to
[2:23:23] do
[2:23:25] tonight and we already started with our
[2:23:28] worship as you are
[2:23:31] worshiping when the musician were
[2:23:33] playing
[2:23:34] here and the whole church was
[2:23:37] standing there are invisible things that
[2:23:39] happen that you don't
[2:23:41] see because when you look at the vapor
[2:23:44] of rain you don't see the vapor is
[2:23:49] invisible when you look when God created
[2:23:52] the
[2:23:54] sea when he created the rivers and the
[2:23:56] big
[2:23:58] sea if you notice the sun will strike
[2:24:01] the
[2:24:02] sea and the sun will shed upon the
[2:24:06] sea and from that
[2:24:09] water that water will be changed into
[2:24:13] vapor in the
[2:24:16] natural invisible the vapor is truly
[2:24:20] invisible you won't see
[2:24:23] it and as the VOR goes
[2:24:26] up it will create a
[2:24:30] cloud and when a cloud has been
[2:24:33] form when there is a bunch of
[2:24:37] clouds that's therefore when God send
[2:24:40] the rain
[2:24:42] down and you will notice that it begin
[2:24:45] to where it's in the
[2:24:48] wilderness and what is the
[2:24:51] Wilderness it's a place where it's
[2:24:55] dry it is an extreme
[2:24:57] place it could be too
[2:25:00] hot or it can be too cold that's why if
[2:25:04] you
[2:25:06] notice when God took the children of
[2:25:09] Israel they were first going through the
[2:25:14] Savanah and God changed the
[2:25:18] seen that Pillar of Fire that you see on
[2:25:21] the
[2:25:22] picture our our picture of
[2:25:27] family and God gave us a picture in
[2:25:30] this this is our picture of our
[2:25:34] family and that Pillar of
[2:25:36] Fire was playing two parts in the in the
[2:25:41] on the
[2:25:42] journey when he was too
[2:25:45] hot
[2:25:47] God will change into a cloud amen
[2:25:51] amen in order to cool down the
[2:25:55] temp as the people are
[2:25:58] walking God cannot send you in the
[2:26:02] wilderness and God cannot provide your
[2:26:05] way to cool you
[2:26:08] down and when it was too dark at
[2:26:12] night he turned into a light amen amen
[2:26:18] when it's too
[2:26:20] hot it turn into something cooling down
[2:26:24] and when it's
[2:26:26] too it turned into a fire and increase
[2:26:29] the
[2:26:31] temperature and they were continuing on
[2:26:33] their
[2:26:35] Journey it is God putting you in those
[2:26:40] trials let me read this where brother
[2:26:43] Bram speak about
[2:26:45] it
[2:26:51] God will never put you in the test
[2:26:54] alone if there is a trial in your
[2:26:58] life it is a means that God uses
[2:27:02] to you up it is a way God uses to bless
[2:27:06] you this is what the pastor
[2:27:09] preach when you are
[2:27:11] hungry it means there is food
[2:27:14] somewhere when you are thirsty
[2:27:18] means there is water
[2:27:20] somewhere but the problem
[2:27:23] is when the children of God find
[2:27:26] themselves in such a
[2:27:29] situation maybe he want to go
[2:27:32] too maybe he want to get
[2:27:35] married but he take
[2:27:38] lightly he doesn't take the desire Ser
[2:27:42] you don't take God at his
[2:27:45] word brother instructed us to take God
[2:27:49] at his
[2:27:50] word God in his
[2:27:55] promises let me read something here in
[2:27:58] the message
[2:28:00] thirst
[2:28:05] 1965 in paragraph
[2:28:08] 118 brother Bram says
[2:28:12] this when God makes a
[2:28:15] promise
[2:28:17] and then comes around and fulfill that
[2:28:22] promise that is the interpretation of
[2:28:25] the
[2:28:28] promise I will dare I will dare anybody
[2:28:32] to take God at his
[2:28:41] word and see if every word in that Bible
[2:28:45] is not the truth EXA that's
[2:28:51] right that is what that thirst is in
[2:28:56] there
[2:29:00] 125 we got a living
[2:29:05] God not one that died 1900 years ago and
[2:29:09] stay in the grave amen
[2:29:14] amen that is in the grave
[2:29:19] by one that raised
[2:29:21] again Hebrew
[2:29:24] 138 he's the same
[2:29:27] yesterday today and
[2:29:31] forever the same holy ghost that fell on
[2:29:34] the day of
[2:29:36] Pentecost is the same holy ghost that is
[2:29:39] here
[2:29:42] now he is that satisfying
[2:29:45] portion
[2:29:47] because he is the
[2:29:49] word that's
[2:29:53] right the Holy Ghost wrote the
[2:29:57] word he interprets the
[2:30:01] word the Bible say in second
[2:30:04] [Music]
[2:30:05] P that the Holy Spirit wrote the
[2:30:10] Bible that man of old moved by the Holy
[2:30:14] Ghost wrote the Bible amen
[2:30:17] amen
[2:30:31] 126 you can do it you can satisfy the
[2:30:35] holy t with nothing less than God
[2:30:38] himself living in
[2:30:45] you I was saying that you could have a
[2:30:48] needs you a desire to go
[2:30:51] study or maybe you want to get
[2:30:54] married but you don't
[2:30:57] know and what brother is saying
[2:31:01] is that it's only the Holy Spirit who
[2:31:04] wrote the
[2:31:05] Bible he's the only one that can
[2:31:08] interpret the
[2:31:09] word only
[2:31:12] God in other words you have to go back
[2:31:14] to
[2:31:15] God when you have a
[2:31:18] need you must look onto the promises of
[2:31:21] God what have God spoke about this for
[2:31:25] my
[2:31:26] situation for my
[2:31:29] condition what have God promised about
[2:31:33] it if there is nothing that God spoke
[2:31:37] about but you have to speak to that
[2:31:41] God because we saw certain women in the
[2:31:45] Bible
[2:31:48] they were not there when God gave the
[2:31:49] law to
[2:31:51] Moses about the
[2:31:54] inheritance and they told
[2:31:56] Moses we are
[2:31:58] women yes that's
[2:32:02] true but when you and God were giving L
[2:32:06] we were not there you didn't include us
[2:32:09] in the
[2:32:10] plan and you know what Moses went back
[2:32:13] to
[2:32:15] God and because God he went to God and
[2:32:18] told God and he t god that those sisters
[2:32:22] those women are claiming their right and
[2:32:25] God have to give Moses something for
[2:32:29] them so why can't you change certain
[2:32:33] things the prophet says
[2:32:38] this brother say if you receive a
[2:32:41] delivery from the devil that you have
[2:32:43] not
[2:32:44] ordered Maybe they come to give you a
[2:32:47] delivery if it doesn't belong to you you
[2:32:50] you send it
[2:32:51] [Applause]
[2:32:53] back give me more volume my
[2:32:56] brother blessed be the name of the
[2:33:01] Lord I went to uh I was looking for a
[2:33:05] car at the
[2:33:10] dealership my purpose was just to go ask
[2:33:13] for the
[2:33:15] price
[2:33:18] and when they give me the price and
[2:33:19] everything then I take the estimate to
[2:33:21] the bank and the bank will finance
[2:33:23] it and when I got to the
[2:33:26] dealer on my
[2:33:30] way before I even went this is what
[2:33:41] happened a voice spoke to me that you
[2:33:43] were asking for a new

[2:33:48] look for that
[2:33:51] car you praying but you staying at home
[2:33:53] you're not going

[2:34:03] went I said you know what let me go
[2:34:06] towards South
[2:34:08] Carolina and as I was on my
[2:34:11] way I saw a sign for a dealership
[2:34:14] somewhere on the road

[2:34:20] exit and my heart was at peace I say ah
[2:34:23] I don't have to go
[2:34:25] back God was continuing to lead
[2:34:29] me and as I continue to go I reach a
[2:34:32] certain point and I saw another
[2:34:37] dealer and I was looking for
[2:34:45] Volvo

[2:42:41] salus it's in the book of act verse 25
[2:42:52] when they arrested
[2:42:56] them the
[2:42:58] devil made a
[2:43:03] [Applause]
[2:43:05] mistake when we took Paul and
[2:43:11] Silas when the devil was whooping them
[2:43:13] he knew what he was doing
[2:43:18] when they put feathers upon their
[2:43:20] feet the devil knew what he was doing
[2:43:22] amen
[2:43:25] amen but what was the mistake of the
[2:43:29] devil when the devil put them in
[2:43:33] prison he took both of them in the same
[2:43:36] place that was the
[2:43:38] mistake two of them in the same church
[2:43:41] that was the
[2:43:42] mistake even though their feet were
[2:43:44] pounded
[2:43:46] even though the hand were
[2:43:48] bound the Bible says
[2:43:51] this they begin to
[2:43:55] praise they begin to

[3:04:14] Corinthians chapter
[3:04:17] 11 thank you
[3:04:20] Jesus amen when people are whooping and
[3:04:24] everything brother brandham taught us
[3:04:27] how to enter the year the right way we
[3:04:30] enter the year the right way with a
[3:04:33] service that have speakers and with
[3:04:37] communion amen amen you remember the
[3:04:40] quote this morning First Corinthian
[3:04:44] chapter
[3:04:46] 11 verse
[3:04:49] 23 amen amen as the Deacon get ready if
[3:04:54] you dare you can say amen
[3:04:57] amen glory to God verse
[3:05:02] 23 Paul says this amen for I have
[3:05:07] received of the Lord th which also I
[3:05:11] delivered unto you
[3:05:15] that the
[3:05:18] Lord somebody's already starting
[3:05:20] praising the
[3:05:24] Lord amen he ain't time yet the count
[3:05:28] down have not started
[3:05:31] yet amen for I have received of the Lord
[3:05:36] th which also are delivered unto you
[3:05:39] that the Lord Jesus the same night in
[3:05:42] which he was betrayed
[3:05:43] he did
[3:05:45] what and when he had given thanks he
[3:05:49] break it and say take eat this is my
[3:05:55] body which is broken for you this do in
[3:06:00] remembrance of me so the Lord's Supper
[3:06:04] is a commandment it is something we have
[3:06:06] to do and as we doing it we are doing it
[3:06:11] in remembrance of him because Israel
[3:06:14] when they were leaving Egypt to start
[3:06:17] their Exodus God changed their
[3:06:21] calendar and they enter into a new
[3:06:24] calendar with the Lord's Supper this is
[3:06:27] what we're going to do tonight amen amen
[3:06:29] verse 25 after the same manner also he
[3:06:33] took the cup and when he had sap saying
[3:06:38] this cup is the New Testament in my
[3:06:41] blood this do ye as of as you drink it
[3:06:46] in remembrance of me so we got to do it
[3:06:50] amen for as often as he eat this bread
[3:06:54] and drink this cup ye do show the Lord's
[3:06:58] death until he does what so you are
[3:07:01] expecting the Lord to come that's why
[3:07:04] brother brandham say the Lord's Supper
[3:07:06] is a duty for believer Amen brother uh
[3:07:11] the the Bible continue Paul he say
[3:07:14] wherefore whatsoever shall eat whosoever
[3:07:17] shall eat this bread and drink this cup
[3:07:19] of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty
[3:07:23] of the body and the blood of the Lord
[3:07:26] Jesus Christ in other word this is not
[3:07:28] just regular food but it's a sacred
[3:07:31] thing if eating this the wrong way has
[3:07:34] consequences so eating this the right
[3:07:37] way must have also positive consequences
[3:07:41] upon you amen and the Bible says but let
[3:07:46] a man examine himself and so let him eat
[3:07:50] of that bread and drink of that cup for
[3:07:54] he that eateth and drinketh unworthily
[3:07:57] eateth and drinketh Damnation to himself
[3:08:00] not Discerning what the Lord's body is
[3:08:04] the Church of the people amen of the
[3:08:06] believer for this cause many are what
[3:08:10] and sickly among you and many do what so
[3:08:13] if you eat the Lord's supper and worly
[3:08:17] you can get sick or you can sleep you
[3:08:20] can die so what about if you eat the
[3:08:24] Lord supper
[3:08:25] correctly what will happen to you
[3:08:28] Hallelujah if you are sick what do we
[3:08:30] expect if some part of your body is not
[3:08:33] functioning well what do we
[3:08:38] think I want you to take this not as a
[3:08:41] routine as you use used to do it before
[3:08:44] but you taking this with Faith that
[3:08:47] whenever I'm taking this I'm expecting
[3:08:50] my body to be
[3:08:53] renewed like the
[3:08:55] eagle because Israel took the natural
[3:08:58] lamb and they went into the Wilderness
[3:09:01] and God be to preserve their clothing
[3:09:04] and their feet were not
[3:09:07] swelling so if your feet are swelling
[3:09:10] tell that foot today I'm going to put
[3:09:12] some in this part I will see how you
[3:09:15] going to swell
[3:09:18] again everybody okay the Bible says
[3:09:22] verse 31 for if you judge yourself we
[3:09:25] should not be judged but when we are
[3:09:28] judged we are chasten of the Lord that
[3:09:31] we should not be condemned with the
[3:09:33] world wherefore Brethren when you come
[3:09:36] together to eat do
[3:09:38] what be patient one with the other and
[3:09:41] if any man hunger let him eat what that
[3:09:45] your natural food that ye come not
[3:09:48] together under what and the rest will
[3:09:51] are set in order when I as we bowing our
[3:09:56] head brother Robert if you can open the
[3:10:00] bread and begin to break
[3:10:03] it the scripture said to T one another
[3:10:07] so as they're doing this go ahead and
[3:10:09] pray on yourself for
[3:10:11] yourself and check if there is something
[3:10:14] that probably you forgot you don't know
[3:10:17] because David say forgive me for
[3:10:19] presumptuous
[3:10:21] sins certain time we do things we didn't
[3:10:24] know that what we done was
[3:10:27] wrong because we are
[3:10:29] not probably T yet into it but God knows
[3:10:34] our heart that's whatever we want to do
[3:10:36] is to please him we want to partake of

[3:30:13] name th will
[3:30:17] be amen let's take John Chapter
[3:30:25] 13 we good on
[3:30:28] time amen
[3:30:40] amen
[3:30:45] John Chapter 13 if you dare you can say
[3:30:49] Amen now verse one before the Feast of
[3:30:52] the
[3:30:53] Passover when Jesus knew that his hour
[3:30:56] was come that he should depart after he
[3:31:00] he should depart out of this world unto
[3:31:03] the father having loved his own which
[3:31:06] were in the world he loved them unto the
[3:31:10] end
[3:31:11] and supper being
[3:31:13] ended the devil having now put in the
[3:31:16] heart of Judah Iscariot Simon son to
[3:31:19] betray him Jesus knowing that the father
[3:31:22] has given all things unto into his hand
[3:31:26] and that he was come from God and went
[3:31:29] to God he rise from supper and laid
[3:31:33] aside His Garment and took a towel and
[3:31:37] GED himself this is the master amen
[3:31:41] after that he pour water into a Bas and
[3:31:45] began to wash the disciples feet and to
[3:31:48] wipe them with the tower wherewith he
[3:31:51] was
[3:31:52] GED then cometh he to Simon Peter and
[3:31:57] Peter say unto him Lord dust thou wash
[3:32:00] my feet sometime we try to be overp
[3:32:04] spiritual Jesus answered and say unto
[3:32:06] him what I do that knoweth not now but
[3:32:10] thou shall know Hereafter Peter say unto
[3:32:14] him thou shall never wash my feet Jesus
[3:32:18] answered him if I wash thee not thou has
[3:32:21] no part with
[3:32:24] me so it's very important to get your
[3:32:28] feet wash Simon Peter say unto him Lord
[3:32:32] not my feet only but also my hands and
[3:32:35] my head Jesus say unto him he that is
[3:32:39] washed needeth not Sav to wash his feet
[3:32:42] but he is clean everywh and ye are clean
[3:32:46] but not all for he knew who should
[3:32:48] betray him therefore said he ye are not
[3:32:51] all clean so after he had washed their
[3:32:54] feet and has taken his garments and was
[3:32:58] sat down again he said unto them know ye
[3:33:01] what I had done to you ye call me who
[3:33:06] and
[3:33:07] what and ye say well for so
[3:33:11] I am and another scripture for
[3:33:14] deity if I then your Lord and Master
[3:33:19] have washed your feet ye also ought to
[3:33:23] wash one other's what for I have given
[3:33:27] you a
[3:33:28] what that you should do as I have done
[3:33:32] to you so what we doing by washing one
[3:33:36] other's feet a sign of humility amen it
[3:33:40] is a the Commandment of God I have
[3:33:43] noticed over the year message believer
[3:33:46] have their kind of
[3:33:48] washing where they put the feet into the
[3:33:51] water I'm a pastor so I have to tell you
[3:33:54] and they just put a hand and do this
[3:33:57] because you don't want to touch one
[3:33:58] another's
[3:34:00] feet if you don't you planning on doing
[3:34:03] that don't do
[3:34:05] it because you washing the feet of
[3:34:09] Jesus normally if Jesus was here you
[3:34:12] will even fell down to wash his feet but
[3:34:15] the Jesus the holy spirit is in your
[3:34:18] brother and your sister so when you're
[3:34:20] doing that you don't do it to your
[3:34:22] brother you're doing that as a
[3:34:24] commandment of God wash one another's
[3:34:27] feet as a sign of humility unto the Lord
[3:34:32] whether the feet look pretty to you or
[3:34:34] not that's not your problem as long as
[3:34:37] the holy spirit is there that's what you
[3:34:39] do I seen that that over the year but
[3:34:42] let not be in this place here let's do
[3:34:46] what God want us to do and God is
[3:34:48] looking at your heart and God will bless
[3:34:50] you because he said he did it as an
[3:34:52] example and we should do it to one
[3:34:55] another and appreciate one another the
[3:34:58] sisters will stay into the sanctuary and
[3:35:00] the brothers you follow the Deacon on
[3:35:03] the other
[3:35:04] side praise God and we'll come back we y
