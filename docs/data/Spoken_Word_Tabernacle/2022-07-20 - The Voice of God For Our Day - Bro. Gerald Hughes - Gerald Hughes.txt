ministers do we have present all right god bless you bless you on two three four five okay wonderful praise the lord well now you know how to pray for me then now been there and done that so you can enter into the fellowship of my my straight uh i never cease to tremble when i stand before god's children and i've had the privilege of standing before thousands at one time but i never get accustomed to it somehow or another you know there's only one thing that's more precious than the blood of the lamb and that's the purchase of that blood and when we stop and realize that it's a very sacred thing then to have the purchase of the blood in your in your hands and in your presence oh my i i don't want to start being critical for sure i don't want to start off on the wrong note because you know but i heard a minister the other day so-called in this message and he said the blood of jesus and the body of jesus wasn't divine yeah a great ministry in this message but see we get too far out and you leave the power of the blood you don't going too far and i was hearing them singing about the blood here tonight it just encouraged my heart amen amen we were not redeemed by corruptible things the silver oh man god created both the egg and the sperm in that virgin womb and it's actually the blood of jehovah amen that was poured out for us yes and then the life of that blood comes back upon the worshipper amen not just the chemistry but the life of that blood that's the token that we are desiring to manifest and express amen and possess tonight i just want to i was talking to brother tommy morris today on the phone and he said now bro i told him i said brother tommy pray for me i said i have no idea what i'm going to be preaching on tonight and i was honest i didn't i and i still don't know for sure so you know it takes the pull [Laughter] and so the letter killeth but the spirit giveth life and uh so we're here for you it takes you know having been brought up in the ozark mountains of arkansas very poor and we didn't even discover electricity there until i was 11 years old and i i don't glory in my poverty but i'm glad that i come up you know arkansas english is a lot like kentucky english and uh but having come up very poor we pulled the old two-man cross-cut saw to saw the wood to keep warm in the winter time and it takes two to pull it and that's kind of the way it is so i remember my big brothers would be on the other end of that saw it would be about six foot long you know and they'd be on the other end of that you know and i and uh they was longer legged and longer arm and stronger i was younger and i learned that they just wear you out they just kill you just about you know working that's all and so i learned if i put a little pressure on it when those pulling then it you know it it cut deep and then whenever it comes back my time i lift up on it a little bit don't be my older brother would say if you're going to ride that thing get a side saddle quit riding the saw so we don't want anybody riding the saw tonight you just pull okay it's not the third push it's the third pull and i come to get something from the lord tonight i want something amen and i'm certainly glad to have brother uh brother michael with me tonight brother mccandy i guess he's already been recognized but he's our um kind of like our head trustee and uh and then the first lady of the church my wife i'm glad to have her here tonight how many believes that god can still speak today when i was about 17 well 18 years old i i fell in love with i thought i i was infatuated with a little girl it was a preacher's daughter and she spoke in tongues and i thought if she was an angel and i thought surely that would be the one that i was supposed to marry and lo and behold when i sought the lord about it he gave me a scripture over in deuteronomy i believe it is somewhere in the there where it says that they couldn't draft a man into the israeli army for two years after he was married because he had to have that bonding time with his wife and so the lord gave me that scripture now i wasn't engaged to that little girl but i was sure inflatuated with her and i thought she was going to be my wife and so the when i sought the lord he gave me that scripture and i knew i was up for the draft i was mandatory draft i had to go into the military the vietnam war was pretty hot during that time must have been 65 1965 and so i said well i knew that wasn't the will of lord for me to get married at least at that time and so to make a long story short by the time i got out of the military two years later my little dove had flew the coop she had done in a backslid and so forth and uh really oh i just tore my heart out i knew that was not god's program for me she has already got married and divorced and ready to remarry and her mother was determined that i was going to be the man that marry her but i knew that wasn't god's program and when i seen how near i had come to making the wrong decision now you young people listen to this boy or girl when i realized how close i had come to making the wrong decision on my own i made a vow to almighty god i said lord god you know my heart i'm not getting married period unless or until you speak to me with an audible voice and i know what you speaking and you'll have to tell me that's the one for me to marry now i'm not saying you have to do that i'm not suggesting you make that vow because there was many times i wish that i hadn't made the vow but i realized the importance of the vow and so i kept the vow by the grace of god that was in 67 that i made that vowel 1967 and it wasn't until 1975 that the lord spoke to me and i'm going to tell you how he spoke now like i said i wished a lot of times that i hadn't made that vow but i kept the vowel and the vowel kept me [Laughter] and so i thought well how am i going to know whether it's god's voice or the devil's voice because the devil's got a voice too he's a good counterfeiter and so but when i recognized the message in 1968 right after getting out of the military and it wasn't too long after i made that bow then i started studying the message and hearing the voice of god for my day [Music] [Applause] you've heard brother branham speak of junior jackson uh brother junior jackson was i think it was the seventh dream uh before brother branham went west to open the seals you know and then it was capped off with a vision but uh brother jackson was over in prior oklahoma ministering he preached a message entitled royalty introduced and he was showing how jesus christ is royalty and he had a introduction at his first advent 2000 years ago and showed how it was scriptural john the baptist in the bible you know the voice of one crying in the wilderness and malachi 3 behold i send my message okay he said if jesus christ is the same hebrews 13 8 if he's the same today and he's still royalty he still has to have an introduction and if he had a scriptural introduction at his first advent he'd have to have a scriptural introduction at his second advent and then he began to show the scriptures how i'd already heard two or three tapes but i had never seen brother branham's ministry in the scripture okay and brother junior jackson began to show malachi 4. revelations 10 7 luke 17 30. oh my all these scriptures amen that identified the message of the hour in the bible hallelujah you've got to see this in the bible hallelujah because this is the revelation of jesus christ hallelujah hallelujah if you can read one verse of scripture in here and you don't see jesus christ you're instructed to read it again read it and then one day oh i was ministering up in that was actually in 68 that i first began to recognize the message but i was ministering way up in michigan and i met this little girl right back here well actually i first met her in jeffersonville at the brown tabernacle in 63 but then later i had ministered for her her dad and they was having little services in their home actually there in lawrence michigan and i knew there was something special about that girl but i also remembered my vow and then so after two or three years i you know i i i said well i'm gonna have to tell her about my vow so i told her about my vow we had the opportunity to be alone and so i told her i said but now honey i didn't say honey but i said now if if god should show me everything if god should show me that you're the one for me to marry would you marry me she said well probably i said probably i i was wanting a more positive i was hoping for a more positive answer you know she said well well yeah if god told you you know that was the one you was you know i said well if he don't if he doesn't speak and show me that you're the one we wouldn't want it to happen anyway amen you wouldn't want it to happen now i wouldn't want it to happen so i said you pray i'll pray and we'll just see you know but at least i told her you know about the vow well it wasn't too long after that maybe a couple of weeks she wrote me a dear john letter i used to call it dear john god will never show you anything about me i'm just i'm not worthy to be your wife he would never show you anything about me to be your wife and it was three or four five pages long big long letter and it started out with a no and ended up with a no i'm just unworthy to be your wife well i thought what happened here i thought i had the maybe possibly the leadership of the lord or something here you know and and but boy this doesn't sound so i called her up on the telephone that's back in the olden days when you had to dial it up you know or bring it up and uh a telephone call back those days cost pretty good amount of money too so i called him from south carolina where i was already pastoring actually i pastored for two years before i was even married but anyway uh the uh when so i called her up from the church where i was actually living in the back of the church and um there in columbia and i i said now what about this letter you wrote always the same thing again and i thought well maybe she wasn't a virgin or something you know because she knew that brother branham said a minister supposed to marry a virgin and so i thought well maybe maybe it's possibility that but i always thought she was a well and when i tried to cross-examine her a little bit oh no brother hughes i've never known another man nothing like that i'm just unworthy to be your wife god will never show you anything about me i'm just unworthy well i thought okay you know it was after a long expensive telephone call it was still a no [Laughter] but i didn't give up i kept praying and it wasn't too long after that maybe a couple of weeks you know back in those days we had the old reel-to-reel tapes i had 300 of them in the church we got from brother perry green we call them seed tapes and then a friend of mine there in colombia a elderly gentleman had passed on uh he was really believing the message he had nine ninety of the tapes his wife wasn't a real believer so when he died she gave me all of his tapes now we've got 390 tapes of the prophet and this was 1975 and so i thought well i haven't heard those 90 tapes yet you know let me get my hands on one of them and i was preparing a message for where i was doing little missionary outreach down in charleston area from columbia and so i i picked this tape uh entitled the secret sudden going away of the church i think that's the name of it and in there brother branham is talking about the man going out west to look for his wife you know the armor meat packing man and so uh i'm i got my up in the middle of the bed with my legs crossed and i got my real real tape right here in the bed with me you know it was a actually it was an old man i used to have a wallow sack and this is sony i nude up a little bit and got a nicer uh reel-to-reel tape player and i get to this place where this uh this young man goes out west you know and he's uh visiting out there looking for a wife of course all the ranchers daughters they all you know acted like they're going to get him and they put on their frock and everything and they're sick shooters and the dance and the big feast and so forth but that's he didn't he wasn't looking for that but there was one little girl amen that little cousin or something that was pouring out the dishwater you know and happened to work barefooted and he noticed her you know because he he went away from the party and set out on the crowd fence and then he noticed this little girl and one day he or one night it was i think he got between her and the house and said now do you know why i'm over here and uh she said well i you know and he said well i'm i'm looking for a wife and he said i believe you're you're the one that i'm looking for amen aren't you glad the lord was looking for you oh my oh my you have not chosen me but i've chosen you amen only only the predestinated are considered in redemption if you question that go listen to the tape who is this melchizedek let me say that again only the predestinated are considered in redemption amen unless you have a predestinated representation you haven't got an ear to hear the voice of god for your day [Music] and i had just heard brother branham he said it's one of the quotes here i want to if we have the time to get to it tonight uh brother branham i hear in one of the quotes we have tonight he said now here it is right here i'll just read this or maybe we have it on the screen do we have that on the screen it's actually number three uh two of number three if we could bring that up on the screen i want the church to see this because this was so key in my life brother stephen it was so key because i had just heard brother branham say this he said i am god's voice to you he said he said now if that offended you but he said it again i am god's when the angel of the lord moves down and so forth i am god's voice to you is that right look at this now this that's not the one right there but uh it's number three in the order i believe okay here we go here we go now i'm your brother by the grace of god but when the angel of the lord moves down it becomes then a voice of god to you maybe if i offended you by saying that forgive me but i felt that might have been resented you know that's the problem in this message people without a revelation resist the authority of the voice of god but i am god's voice to you see i say that again that time was under inspiration you see and i felt bad about it the first time but i it repeated it it repeated it now see i can say nothing in myself but what he shows me i say it you believe it and watch what happens see he did after sitting in the great meetings and so i thought well but i really wasn't thinking about that quotation i just heard brother branham say it and here i am listen to this tape and all of a sudden this little woman says i'm unworthy to be your wife and and the voice of god through the prophet said that's the one the one that says she's unworthy [Applause] i i turned i flipped the switch and i put it on rewind i played it again and what it said to me was that's the one the one that says she's unworthy i played it the third time you know what i said the third time the same thing the tapes always say the same thing [Applause] amen you can't make them say anything different but i didn't tell nobody i just slipped out of my room there went into the auditorium and knelt down and started praying i said god could you possibly be speaking to me i don't want to just you know you can make the bible say anything you want to the bible says what they'll do is do quickly and then it also said judas went out and hung himself you could put it together and say well so-and-so's got to go hang themselves but and do it right now quickly but see i said lord am i just hearing things am i just wanting to hear this you have to be careful now you better know it's the holy ghost you better know it's the leadership of the spirit of god amen amen i didn't tell nobody i just felt a witness in my heart that was god speaking the voice of god answering my vow but i didn't tell anybody i went straight to arkansas or that they was having a special meeting about 700 believers were gathered during those times for meetings a camp meeting and there happened to be my little wife i knew she was going to be there and so i i checked with her a sister who was in charge kind of a older sister at that time i think and we had the privilege of having a little privacy to talk and i told her and then i told her my background and she told me her background and that night i said now if your daddy agrees [Laughter] we had to call daddy amen do you realize the bible brother brown said consider the law consult the law of marriage and divorce in those things in the scriptures amen he see it doesn't all those things are still relevant in a sense and so i called up her father that night and i said brother davis i said would you uh i got him up it was about eleven o'clock at night and his name was charles you know so i said would you mind coming out on the porch and me talking with me you know brother branham had to ask his father out on the porch he didn't catch what i was talking about because i woke him up at 11 o'clock at night i said well what i'm trying to say is i'm wondering if i could marry your daughter ah and he said well son he said i i don't know of anybody that i'd rather have as a son-in-law than you he said in fact god had already showed me that you is going to be my son-in-law yeah amen and so uh i went back to south carolina didn't tell nobody but when i got back i told my song leader and he said well you gotta announce it to the to the church this morning oh i preached that sunday morning and i was so well i really didn't want to announce it uh and kind of semi forgot about it i guess but out on the front porch then we'd all dismissed little church wouldn't hold but about 75 people maybe there on pope street in colombia and uh i the song leader then was out in front of the church the song leader said i believe the pastor's got an announcement to make to the church and so i said well you know i guess so i said uh yeah i'm i'm i i'm engaged and i'm gonna be getting married and uh sister arnett was standing right by side of me brother branham had interpreted a few dreams for her and so forth and her husband is the one that asked brother branham about whether or not they should start a church in columbia in 1965 but here she is stand beside me and we'd already dismissed this church and then they asked who it was and this girl right back here had only been down there one time to that church and i said well it's going to be it's shirley and davis and sister arnett said well i could have told you that god showed me that in a dream wow and we hadn't even we hadn't even went together we hadn't been courting or anything but for all of that that's the main thing is when you see the manifestation of what it brings forth and i'm so thankful tonight to have her i've never given this testimony like this before and to have her like this here with me but uh my i often say it like this brother stephen my wife and my sweetheart is the same girl and we've had nine children together and i'm really thankful [Applause] a year or so back i could say there everyone serving the lord even the grandchildren but i'm burdened tonight my youngest daughter and son-in-law they need your prayers they need your prayers and just the names is lee joseph lee melvin and shekinah joy melvin they live in florida please remember them true prayers amen amen but i am encouraged because paul told the philippian jailer believe thou and thy house amen shall be saved believe on the lord thy god thou and thy house shall be saved amen and if esther could intercede amen for her kindred amen how much more can we do today under the blood of the lamb amen so i'm believing that my children they shall be there and their offspring with them praise the lord so we're happy for them amen and so i'm really happy tonight to have sister hughes with me and uh and of course brother michael helped me drive up and i appreciate him so very much and now let's get right into the word okay that's just a little testimony and uh i just really appreciate this the atmosphere that we have here tonight and all these smiling faces man that have to be totally backslid not to preach amen he started singing back there and i just really got inspired amen and i i even found a couple of quotes that i didn't have already repaired i got to read these before we get into the message is that all right okay this came to me while you were singing back there um this is uh church age book page 16 61. that word has never failed in the mouths of believing christians and in this last age it is here stronger and greater than ever in the true word bride don't tell me that you wish that you'd had rather lived in bible days 2 000 years ago this is a greater day than that [Applause] that word has never failed in the mouths of believing christian and in this last age this age it is here stronger and greater than ever in the true word right don't look back don't look back this is bible days this is the greatest bible days there's ever been this is the fulfillment of the old and the new this is the opening of the word of god oh my here's stronger and greater in this age on page 64 he says it like this don't fear john don't fear little flock all that i am you are heir to oh my power is yours my omnipotence is yours and i stand in your midst i have not come to bring fear and failure but love and courage and ability all power is given unto me and it is yours to use you speak the word and i will perform it that is my covenant and it cannot never fail it can never fail that's god's covenant oh my god i needed that back there because i didn't know you know you feel so unworthy and so forth but that was an encouragement to me as the lord reminded me of those scriptures so i thought i'd just share them with you if you have your bibles and would like to stand i want you to i'd like to draw your attention to hebrews chapter 3. verse 1 wherefore holy brethren partakers of the heavenly calling consider the apostle and high priest of our profession christ jesus amen who was faithful to him that appointed him as also moses was faithful in all his house for this man was counted worthy of more glory than moses in as much as he who hath builded the house is has hath more honor than the house for every house is builded by some man but he that built all things amen he's god and that was emmanuel is that right which being interpreted is god with us jehovah the old testament none other than jesus christ of the new testament and moses fairly was faithful in all his house as a servant for a testimony of those things which were to be spoken after but christ as a son over his own house whose house are we if we hold fast the confidence and the rejoicing of the hope firm unto the end wherefore as the holy ghost saith today if you will hear his voice harden not your hearts as in the provocation in the days of temptation in the wilderness amen i'm going to skip on down to verse 14. for we are made partakers of christ if we hold the beginning of our confidence steadfast unto the end while it is said today if ye will hear his voice harden not your hearts as in the provocation i believe that's sufficient reading let's pray now with our heads bowed lord jesus we need you this hour to speak to every heart and especially to mind or consecrate us for this little service tonight bless this congregation continue to bless it lord continue to bless uh brother shembo lord god just continue lord and may you open up your the windows of heaven and continue to reveal yourself in a greater way every service granted is our prayer in jesus name amen you may be seated the lord bless you i want to speak tonight on the voice of god for our day but a sub-topic the order the apostolic order of the scripture and i want to ask the church a question here and i don't want you to answer it verbally but in your heart just tell me just tell yourself whether or not you have the answer if you'd like to lift your hand and you have the answer that's okay too who was the first apostle in the new testament anybody know all right good all right we just read it here in the scripture this is evidence that jesus christ was the first apostle in the new testament because this is the only place in the bible where jesus is called an apostle you say well what about john the baptist he was one sent from god and the missionary apostle is one sin john the baptist himself said christ was preferred before me because he was performing before abraham was i am twice john the baptist said he was preferred before me because he is before me he was before me so we see then that jesus christ is the first apostle in the new testament and if they have the order of those quotes now i want to be real quick with these quotes brethren and just have them ready to flip on the screen because we want the message to speak to us tonight just not a uneducated south carolinian now maybe we'll read one other scripture while they're getting ready to pull those quotes up and we'll do them in the order that we that i gave them to you uh if you will let's go over here now right quick to first corinthians three and this is just kind of a a little teaching little teaching uh message i guess you'd call it that first corinthians 3 1 uh 3 9 i'm sorry verse 9. for we are laborers together with god ye are god's husbandry you are god's building whose building you are so we just according to the grace of god which is given unto me as a wise master builder i've laid the foundation and another buildeth their own but let every man take heed how he buildeth their own for other foundation can no man lay than that which is laid which is jesus christ so we're talking about the apostolic order and um we want to go forward here and um maybe read one other scripture before we go to the quotes and we'll try to be real quick uh revelation chapter 3 and if you'll notice here verse 20 behold i stand at the door and knock if any man hear my voice and open the door i will come in to him and will sup with him and he with me none of the previous six uh ages spoke of the voice of god only in this seventh age of laodicea is the voice of god mentioned if any man hear my voice okay now then i want to draw your attention while we're here in revelations to chapter 6 and verse 7. and before we read verse 7 i'd like to draw your attention to the first three beasts the first three seals and in each case verse 1 i saw when the lamb had opened one of the seals and i heard as it were the noise of thunder one of the four beasts say saying come and see all right verse three and when it opened the second seal i heard the second beast say come see and the third seal in verse five and when he had opened the third seal i heard the third beast say come see but notice the difference now when it comes to this fourth seal which is the eagle age and we'll read beginning with verse 7 okay and when he had opened the fourth seal i heard the voice of the fourth beast say come and see and we know that this is the eagle age amen and i was so uh encouraged to see the big eagle out front and then when i it's my first time to be here and then the spoken word amen the spoken word is the voice of god for our day and that's the original seed the spoken word is the original seed is that right amen all right one other scripture if it's not scriptural it's it's we don't want it is that right one other scripture and that's in isaiah chapter 62 52 isaiah 52 and uh this is very important and here we're going to read the three verses at least beginning with verse six isaiah 52 6 listen real closely because remember now uh in the message uh christ the mystery of god revealed the prophet taught us that if you can read one verse of scripture and you don't see jesus christ in your bible in that verse of scripture you need to read it again because jesus christ is the principle theme of the entire scriptures is that right okay so all right then let's see if we can see the message and we can see christ in these verses isaiah 52 6 therefore my people shall know my name not titles therefore they shall know in that day that i am he that speak that doth speak behold it is i how beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him that bringeth good tidings and publish of peace and bringeth good tidings of good and publishes salvation that saith unto zion thy god reigneth now here it is thy watchman he's not talking about false shepherds here he's talking about thy watchman god's watchman thy watchman shall lift up the voice with the voice together shall they sing for they shall see eye to eye when the lord shall bring again zion the restoration of zion see brother adam said any time you see the the words daughter of zion it's speaking of the bride and the way god restores zion is the way he restores the bride tree amen and so we are living now in the fulfillment of malachi 4. behold i send unto you elijah the prophet and he not some denomination not some group of preachers but he shall turn the heart of the children back to the fathers is that right and restore the word of god and so here he says it now when the lord shall bring against zion there's a time when this voice of god is going to be elevated it's going to be lifted up and we have to not only talk about the message anybody can just read that's just being able to read you know or hear that just using your ear the natural but see if we had a song book we could read to you i could read to you out of the song book but for me to sing that song that's that's something different put the words with music and the lyrics the music and the harmony and then for all of us to get in one mind and one accord and lift up the voice together that's when the holy spirit is really going to move in our midst because the holy spirit loves harmony and unity amen and we can only do that as we see with one eye as the seer of god has brought the word of god to us and the spirit and the prophet and the bride all say the same thing amen under her messenger she will be the final voice to the final age under her messenger and then when the rapture takes place the spirit of the the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride will be heard in her no longer see the voice of the bridegroom and of the bride is one voice god doesn't have two different voices and all that was poured into all that god was was poured into christ and all that was in christ is poured into his elect into the true church of the living god oh my what are we living in no wonder he's here stronger and greater in this age than in any other previous time all right i want to go forward now so let's go fast as we possibly can i realize that this is wednesday night and uh how many how many gifts how many privileged to have a job and you get to work tomorrow you get to go to work you should never say i have to go to work you should never say i i have to go to church you should say oh it's a privilege to go to church i was happy when they said unto me let us go into the house of the lord amen enter his cage with thanksgiving into his course with praise right yes amen all right now the order that we have these i want you to do them one right after another and i wish i had a pointer but it's all right bible teaching is usually a little treacherous a little you know kind of uh walking out on the thin ice we call it but you just feel we just feel that maybe at this point and at this time it might be good to kind of bring the church to what i think a complete understanding positionally of what we are in christ jesus and sometimes i think that preaching is a wonderful thing but i believe sometimes brother dealer that teaching goes beyond that it kindly especially to the church now preaching usually catches the sinner brings him under condemnation by the word but teaching places the man positionally what he is and we can never rightly be able to have faith until positionally we know what we are that's adoption what's adoption brother hughes your position in christ amen all right he was taught by the holy ghost one day jesus was up on the earth a certain important man came to him we know it was nicodemus this man said rabbi we know you are a teacher sin from god but you will notice that jesus cut him short he turned to nicodemus and the words that he spoke may well be paraphrased thusly i am not a teacher when i first read that in the church age book i thought what is this i am the sacrificial lamb for sin i am making possible the new birth my spirit by my spirit but there is coming one who is the teacher he is the holy spirit when jesus was up on the earth he came as the lamb and as the prophet but when he came back upon the church he the same one came back upon the church by his spirit he became the teacher and to every age we hear the same truth he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith to the churches in all seven church ages the same words are he repeated hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith to the churches now we're talking about the evidence of the holy ghost [Laughter] they either have an ear let him here oh my here it is now david no better than that nathan was in the land in that day he wasn't even consulted at all see he consulted the captains of hundreds and thousands and the people shouted and screamed and danced instead they had all religious motion but it wasn't in the line and order of god's word and it failed listen close now anything else is not in the line and order of god's word will fail only god's word will stand forever heavens and earth will pass away but not my word so tonight we're talking about the apostolic order anything that's outside of the line and order of god's word will fail remember the scripture also says let all things be done decently and in order so god's got an order listen closely now i'm just your brother we had that one already let's let's go forward now faith is based on forgiveness perfect faith and then if we now brother branham had just read the text in mark 6 uh mark 11 22 if you say unto this mountain okay that's where he took his text when he preached this message and then the first thing he says after he takes his text now faith is based on forgiveness then and then as we said this morning trying to get the church into the place to where we could really see apostolic times moving among us that's what we all hunger and that's just laying right at the door we see it but we want to see more of it we wanted such a flow that it'll it'll be a help to us us flow out to others my apostolic order flowing out to others we need a revelation of the apostolic order of almighty god and then we can come to order ourselves and then we can let that same order flow out to others and teach the proper order of church order and the scriptural order of the living god and the brewery lesson we had last night now this is backing up to 1954 mark of the beast listen closely actually i didn't even recognize this quote until about two years ago three years ago of all my study and all the years of studying the myths i probably heard it but it didn't register you know what i mean okay and the very lesson we had last night he had seven stars in his hand and each star was to be given to each church age for a light right just the same as there's an apostle there there's an apostle there there's an apostle there there's an apostle there which was the seven spirits in the beginning of our lesson standing before god to be sent out to the seven church ages [Applause] now brother branham said brother branham said i don't know why they want to be called missionaries but really it's an apostle so then he's if you want to be technical brother branham calls himself an apostle over 40 times in the message over 40 times brother branham said i'm a missionary but he didn't go around patting himself on the back boast himself and say you got to follow me i want to compare the apostolic ministry that god has sent to us in this day i'd like for us to consider it a little bit and compare it with the so-called apostle ministry that we find in africa south america north america and europe many different parts even in india i run into it over there some man that raise up and even claiming to believe the message but you've got to come under my authority you got to be one and and you got the different little churches even have to pay tithe in many cases to the head church brother bran i never did do anything like that and you don't see paul doing that either but look only one message for each age receives what the spirit has to say for that age and that one messenger is the messenger to the true church he speaks for god by revelation to the churches plural both true and false the message is then broadcast to all but though it is broadcast for all who come within the range of the message that message is received individually individually by only a certain qualified group in a certain way [Applause] each individual in that group is the one who has the ability to hear what the spirit is saying by way of the messenger those who here are not getting their own private revelation nor is a group getting their collective revelation but each person and brother branham has it in big bowl letters each person is hearing and receiving what the messenger has already received from god amen that's when we can see eye to eye that's when we can lift up the voice and and sing together they may not just talk the message but walk the message and sing the message oh it's music in god's ears then hallelujah oh my then we can see how that angels could not perfect worship they cannot sing amazing grace they've never been lost only the elect can sing oh my the amazing grace of god [Music] if that was taught by the lord then confirmed by his disciples that we've heard now paul being the same uh paul was that first church angel messenger right first apostle let's let's pause here hold that on the screen just a moment now where did the 12 apostles get their apostolic anointing from jesus christ the first the first apostle we determined that jesus christ was the first apostle all right who's the last apostle of course but he himself said i'm the first and the last right okay okay but now i'm going to say something here in just a minute all seven of these manifest it takes the seven varieties of the spirit not seven gods but the seven varieties of the seven spirits to bring forth the fullness of the true apostolic ministry we have received the greatest apostolic ministry of all time what is it brother hughes it's the alpha and the omega the alpha apostol apostolic ministry the alpha son of man ministry and the omega son of man ministry [Applause] apostolic hallelujah certainly apostolic [Applause] now paul was saying record 105 paul was saying that to his hebrew audience now they didn't have tape recorders today like we got here they had scribes who was sitting there taking it down just as paul was preaching it and that's what it is right here we're getting it by tape recorders and these tapes go all over the world see to show that it is the truth our religion is not in vain it's absolutely the resurrected jesus christ the same thing now we mustn't neglect it how shall we escape if we neglect who have heard the very voice of god for our day how shall we escape if we have heard the message of grace it's not law the letter killeth god it's grace oh my it's amazing grace oh yes and then i thought that sounded pretty good so i just held to that if a man's got love does sound good don't it ain't that all you need just love love everybody just go anywhere love the homos love everything just love love the government love everything let me pause here just a moment did you realize god don't love everybody you say now wait a minute brother hughes where's that in the bible jacob have i loved but esau i have hated god hates sin god hates compromisers god hates hypocrites god loves his elect god loves him predestinated god foreknew that you would love him and would want to serve him hallelujah now maybe i better say something here also before we go for further god does not predestinate just on the basis of his desire because he his desire is not that any should perish but that all should come to repentance he's long suffering but he predestinates on the basis of his foreknowledge is that right amen oh my god yes indeed all right here we are now let's go forward and then i thought well that sounds pretty good so i just held to that you know the background of this if you want to go listen to it he's been talking to brother vale about what is the evidence of the holy ghost okay and uh he asked brother vale uh you know what do you think and brother bill asked him well he said do you think it's in uh speaking in tongues he said no even though i've been taught that i don't think so what do you think it is then brother branham he said well you know best i know is is love and he said so i held to that we held to that for a while but i want you to notice that god straightens his man out look what's this but one day the lord in a vision straightened me out [Music] pause again i gotta pause again we are not feeding on the words of a man his words will fail but we are feeding on the unfailing body word of the son of man jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever oh we must not neglect this message we must have an ear to hear and feed oh my respect the voice of god for your day god straightened me out in a vision he said the evidence of the spirit was those who could receive the word neither love nor speaking in tongues but it's receiving the word [Applause] [Music] and then dr vale was saying to me he said that's that's scriptural he said because in john jesus said when the holy ghost is come upon you he will reveal these things to you that i've taught you and will show you things to come so there is a genuine evidence of the holy ghost he has never told me anything wrong yet it is the evidence of the holy ghost is he who can believe the word you can receive it jesus never said when the holy ghost comes you'll speak in tongues he never said when the holy ghost come you do any of these things manifestations i'll put that in there but he said he will take these things of mine and show them to you and will show you things that is to come so there is the genuine evidence of the holy ghost according to jesus himself [Music] he that hath an ear let him hear amen when this chain is broke this is harvest time 64. listen now we're going to say something when this chain is broke i've got a chain in my pulpit at the church about two foot long and sometimes i'll get somebody hanging on that chain over the over the altar and i'll hold on to that chain and that's how we are hanging over hell by a chain and it's only as strong as its weakest link don't forget that when this chain is broke adam and eve the first family now remember they didn't break a sentence they didn't break three words one word man shall hang over hell by every word every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of god that's where man's eternal destination is determined there's where man's eternal destination is determined why he'll hang by that chain or he'll hang by creed and if there's a creed mixed into the chain there's where the weak link is and you're gone that's where the weak link was with adam and with eve that weak link surely he said you know the serpent god surely god said it if god said it god meant it and he also keeps his word by saying the day that you eat thereof that day you die everybody awake listen closely the day you put into you anything else besides the unadulterated word of god into your soul that's the day you set you're separated from god what have you been feeding on [Applause] the day you put it to you into your soul anything else besides this spoken word which is original seed the unadulterated word of god that's the day you separate yourself from god by feeding on the wrong thing we must come back to the word the truth the whole truth and know him but the truth amen the word of god for our day sure amen now we can see that jesus christ is revealing himself through the ages by his spirit in the messengers they are as moses was to the children of israel the messengers each one of these seven apostles were as moses was to the children of israel amen now remember moses wrote the basis of the old testament first five books paul wrote the majority of the epistles of the new testament amen and they both had to go to the backside of the desert amen to do that and then god sent our prophet to the backside of the desert to bring the interpretation of both the old and the new and that's what we have oh my god amen and when that happened the bible become like a new book yes amen [Music] as he had the revelation for his day so each messenger had god's revelation and ministry for that day thus when we see the messengers are in his hand we see the lord identifying himself with these men and granting them his power listen now it's not enough there's something that's not quite enough it is not enough that he has associated himself with the whole church which we saw when we seen uh when he was seen standing amongst the seven golden lampstands nor is it even enough it's not enough that's still not enough nor is it even enough that we see the fivefold ministry of ephesians four apostles prophets teachers evangelists and pastors now notice the apostles are included in here all the prophets and all the apostles are included in here but he still said that's not enough [Laughter] for in each age even in the bride age anointed ones at the end time come on now think about it in each age in each age for in each age the church goes astray and it is not just the laity but the clergy group shepherds are wrong as well as sheep then what happens capital g.o.d god brings himself on the scene as the chief shepherd in the ministry of these seven men to lead his people back to the truth and the abundant power of that truth oh hallelujah oh yes mama he that hath and ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches in each age in every age it was the same crowd hear what the spirit says if you are a christian how many christians we have here tonight you will get back to what the spirit is teaching that is the word of this age every messenger of every age will preach that word how many would like to have a new and a fresh revival in your heart in your home in your church i sure would okay here's it here is the formula here's the remedy here it is this is the voice of god telling you how to get it oh my here it is here it is every fresh every one of them every fresh and every true revival will be because men have gotten back to the word for their age [Music] the cry of every age is the rebuke you have left the word of god repent and come back to the word from the first book in genesis to the last book revelation there's only one reason for god's displeasure leaving the word and there's only one remedy to regain his favor back to the word back to the word back to the message for your day hallelujah [Music] can the church say amen [Music] i had my alarm set let me check it how many of you as individuals will just give me five more minutes raise your hand hold your hand up five ten fifteen twenty twenty five thirty twenty four [Laughter] [Applause] no [Applause] i said individually don't you love the lord jesus [Applause] ain't it brand to be a christian ain't it grand ain't it grand to be a christian ain't it grand on a sunday monday tuesday wednesday all day i grant to be a christian 80 grand ain't it grand to love your brother ain't it grand ain't it grand to love your brother ain't it rain on a monday tuesday wednesday thursday friday say all day sunday 80 grand to be a christian 80 grand oh 80 grand to love your sister ain't it grand ain't it grand to love your sister ain't it round on a monday tuesday wednesday thursday friday saturday all day sunday 80 grand to be a christian ain't it praying stay with me now ain't it grand to love your pastor ain't it right [Music] hey love your pastor ain't it graham on a monday tuesday wednesday thursday friday saturday all day sunday 80 grand to love you're a pastor it right oh listen now i'm going to say something this is thus saith the lord by the vindicated prophet god would rather see you love one another than to even love him now he's talking about the elect [Music] he's talking about the elect god would rather see you love one another and he said that's the way any father feels about his children if you want to do something for me do it for my children i'd rather you say something about my children amen aren't you glad to be part of the family of god [Applause] praise the lord [Music] you know if i preach everything that i know tonight there's no need of me coming back and if i tried if i tried to preach everything i knew tonight you wouldn't want me to come back i should be i'd be preaching the empty seats probably so god bless you thank you so much for your your your attentiveness you've got such a fine spirit here you've got such a fine lovely church i like the way you've got it designed and everything and it's such a privilege but remember now the beauty of any church is what the character of the people amen and he said fear not little flock little fly it's the father's good pleasure to give you up to half the kingdom no it's not written like that you need to read your bible all the old kings in the olden day even a hazardous to esther said you know up to half the kingdom but not this case he said it's the fear not little flock it's the father's good pleasure to give you the entire kingdom [Applause] oh my think about it we are heirs of god and joint heirs with christ oh my i'm trying to find a place to close now so stay with me the quotes are behind us now and i trust that they're in our hearts something the effects of them in our hearts but brothers and sisters love one another love one another when john the scribe of the old testament uh that wrote he didn't write the book of revelation but he received it as described and when he got so old that he couldn't preach anymore hardly the deacons would lead him to the pulpit and he'd just beat on the pulpit and he'd say love one another that was his last words his last message love one another love one another amen amen he that loveth amen is born of god amen and so love your brother love your sister love one another and above all love god and remember this message to the laodicean age he said as many as i love i love i will rebuke and chase it be zealous therefore and repent let's bow our heads just a moment and this will be the evidence the scriptural evidence to show that you'll know whether or not you are among the elect of god you be honest with god now i've had him pull the rug out from under me i tell you he knows how to give you a weapon but he said as many as i love in the church age book brother brown said it's not our love that's in question it's god's love that's in question anybody can say i love jesus but this has the elective love of god been revealed to you through calvary for god so loved the world he gave his only begotten son how do we know that god loves us brother branham because god said so we take him at his word amen and we want to conduct ourselves in a godly manner to show amen our love back to him amen elective love with our heads bowed every eye closed if you will just for a moment thank you for your respect you've been so so jubilant tonight and victorious and pulling uh you certainly pulled your end of the saw as it were and uh it made it real easy for me to bring this message even if it was in a condensed form but i wonder now you'll be honest with god i'm not going to call you up here to the altar or anything like that but i want you to be honest with yourself see one place in the message brother ben said he's coming back for the honest in heart that's one he's coming back for the honest in heart and when the the bride raptures she won't be raptured by her good track record it'll be by the grace of god by grace through faith and so but now if you find in your own individual life that you've been maybe feeding on the wrong thing too much actually a little is too much we don't want to put anything into our soul except the unadulterated word of god remember your heart and your mind is like the womb and it it must be filled and pregnanted with this spoken word which is the original seed and when that is sealed in you by the holy ghost that token comes in nothing else can come in then see it seals the womb that life-giving flow seals the womb and you're sealed through time and eternity but maybe you'd say brother hughes i'm maybe i seem like my life i've just maybe left the word a little bit i haven't been you know paul said how shall we escape if we neglect so great a salvation and maybe you just say well brother hughes i feel like maybe the holy spirit's bringing to my attention that i've been neglecting the message i've been neglecting to read my bible a christian must read the bible and pray every day every day one place brother brown said water read chapter after chapter might think about it and you'd say well i i want to come back to the word i want to come back and line up i believe the holy spirit's speaking to me tonight and i have some repentance to do lift your hand up yes uh yes all over my yes god bless you my my my my amen amen i believe it's actually the majority but let's stand to our feet all of us together if you will heavenly father we love you lord my hand also i lord you know how that i neglect many times and lord it's because we're not conscious always of your presence but you've brought yourself on the scene as the chief shepherd and you're here and if there's anything the gates of hell is against they're not against the denomination they're not even against the so-called message churches but the gates of hell are against the revelation of jesus christ being present now being here now lord you've taken your your man but you didn't take your spirit you're here to present to yourself a bride without spot or blemish our prophet said even as john said when christ came on the scene i must decrease that he might increase oh lord jesus you vindicated your presence in around and around the world through the messenger oh god and we know that you're here lord to present to yourself a bride we just want to line up i want to line up lord and i'm sure those that have uh been rejoicing with me tonight and then have the courage to lift their hands and say i see brother hughes in my life or that i need to measure up oh god that's the whole purpose of coming to church that we might be corrected and draw closer to you and receive your love which is corrective oh father we thank you and lord i thank you for this assembly may they continue to grow in the grace and knowledge of our lord jesus christ may the stimulation of revelation always be their portion oh god how we thank you lord for this little flock bless them lord give each one individually the desires of their heart you know what was behind the hand when it went up lord and lord uh that in itself hallelujah to me hallelujah oh god you don't have to come down and storm the building but lord that in itself shows that these are your children they love you lord and oh god i'm sure oh god that you love them because you've manifested yourself to them by revealing yourself to them oh what is the new birth brother brandon the revelation of jesus christ personally unto you continue to reveal yourself to each of us father we pray in jesus christ's name amen amen as our musicians come will and maybe the pastor however you'd like to do it i want to step out of the way here again i want to thank brother maybe i should say dr shimbo you know i've trusted him to work on my mouth and he's asked me to minister on different occasions but i said well i'm going to do you just like you done me you know when i went into his office they insisted on a whole mouthful of x-rays you know they wanted all the panoramic view of my entire mouth and x-ray after x-ray of course i'm i'm sure that wasn't the type of x-ray that's zapping all the light out of your body but nonetheless uh when he asked me to minister then i said well i no i'm not tonight i said i sit and listen to him minister i said i'm just here to take some x-rays [Laughter] so i had the honor and the privilege of setting not in this building but when we're over in the motel you know the services over there and hearing your pastor and i was every night i was just chunk full amen and so that's what give me liberty brother uh brother stephen to bring the quotes see knowing where you stand in the word and so forth and uh you're blessed to have a pastor like brother shambo you stay right behind me amen you're certainly you're certainly blessed amen so uh even the order of the church and everything musicians and so forth god bless you and help you amen i love him i love him because he first loved me can we sing that little just real humbly amen with our eyes closed in worship [Music] with your hands up to him now [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh [Music] jesus is the sweetest name i know and he's just the same as his lovely name that's the reason why oh that's the reason oh i love your soul for

clap of him hallelujah do you see how god is wonderful those who were here on saturday we dealt with the evidence of the holy spirit and then on sunday it looks like brother hughes was here on sunday [Music] amen it is not me buddy it is the holy spirit it's a language of god he's pointing you something amen he's insisting and confirming that i am exactly the one who's bringing this thing to you amen because brother yours is coming way south carolina he was not here you might say maybe on sunday he might have heard us on youtube but on saturday it was not recorded he was questioned and answered on the evidence of the holy spirit it was not recorded so it is purely the holy spirit clearly the spirit of the lord moving amen and we thank the lord he could move aside and be led by the spirit of god to nail on the seven spirit of god the seven stars and everything on the money right there in line like he was in service amen brother use your father-in-law did he have a vision or was it a dream he said the lord spoke to him already you don't know yet it's the sister that was the dreamer the sister was the dreamer okay yeah because there is a hidden message in that in what he was saying at the beginning it's a whole message that is coming up amen amen it's a marriage of a man and a woman through the office of the voice of god for the day it's a message it was a message hidden right there i caught the language ready amen it was not his marriage he thought he was giving a testimony but he was not giving a testimony he was talking about the marriage of the lamb amen the marriage of the lamb you remember on sunday those virgins were only engaged they were only a spouse but the marriage was not yet amen and guess what brother used pastor before he was married and jesus christ was the great shepherd he said in john chapter 10 that he was a shepherd but he was not married yet everybody here he's gone he's getting married now but he was already the pastor so it was not your testimony i can pull the whole message that i already have for the church anybody here and the evidence came from a man and a woman his father-in-law was a man he said the lord spoke to him but the woman got a dream there is a reason why that woman must have a dream and the men have to speak the evidence is coming from a man and from a woman about his wedding you know a dream meaning you're sleeping and you know the scent slipped through the edges right right so the marriage is coming from those sleeping and those that are awake because you have to wake one at one in the night you see how i read that everybody here and what did his wife keep repeating all the time where did ruff fell at the feet of who boasts meaning [Applause] [Music] [Applause] you see how the spirit of the lord moved you thought he was giving his testimony he was wrapping up the marriage of the lamb completely and even what have been preached here [Music] amen brother branham said the reason why ruth wanted defeat because she was not worthy and the woman kept repeating i am not worthy i am not worthy i am not worthy and the prophet said the one who is not worthy that's roof that's the brand hallelujah glory to god i already got a confirmation for the message so you keep praying we appreciate you brother you thank you very much for yielding to the holy spirit that was the spirit of the lord speaking amen you didn't understand why they were pulling you were right in line amen let's give the lord one more big clap thank you very much it has been a great pleasure i'm gonna let brother john lead us
