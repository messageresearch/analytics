hallelujah i wanted that one to kind of be uh i wanted it last so it'd be kind of fresh on our hearts as we you know receive the word as a group singing i don't have any praise reports but i would like to i'd like to give one i spent some time yesterday with brother david over at the new church building we were trying to finish up running some of the wires and i know there were several out there thursday um the pastor would like to um he you know everybody wants to thank thank everybody for their sacrifice to come over and do stuff it looks really good you know the picture i don't know if was everybody seeing a picture of the outside it kind of looked white and almost looked like blue trim in the picture but it's a very nice beige color with black trim the inside the ceilings are all painted and you know i guess we got very close to running all of the last of the wires i think um so it's steadily moving on the the the walls are almost completely um prepared for the drywall right tomorrow good so i got i got in there brother david was he was up in the ceiling somewhere and i stood looking from where the sound booth is going to be out towards the pulpit and i started thinking about the construction of solomon's temple and i was thinking you know wonder what the people were thinking when it was in about the same uh same point of you know as our church is you know and i started thinking and uh i got a little bit overwhelmed and i actually started crying a little bit i felt the presence of god already there so i believe he's waiting on us you know i mean he's already there he's just waiting on us so um it's very exciting you know just and we may never have a service in it the good lord could come you know before then and that's fine that's fine i just want to go when he does come amen i want to do my best till then um also before i before i ask anybody if they've got a prayer request for a praise report the purple box with the balloon on it back at the back is for the questions for the family meeting we're going to have it at my house we're looking forward to it it's not exactly a perfect house but we like it you're all welcome there i don't think anybody that's ever been there has had a had a spirit of unwelcome we open our doors and uh you know so we want everybody to come we'll find room if we have to eat in the yard okay it doesn't matter we just want you there we want the fellowship because it's been a while we want the questions because this is for our youth i've put one in the box so we're going to have a good time now does anybody else have a praise report yes ma'am i'm gonna give you the microphone i want to take this opportunity to give god thanks praise two weeks ago when i sang and the anointing phil i i got up this morning and that morning and i was i was doing my bills and putting what for the building fund and offering and everything and that morning i said i'm checking everything up and i'm like i have to pay this bill i have to be that bill and the lord say give x amount but give x amount would put me behind so i said lord i'm going to take you at your word and you want me to put x amount i'll put it i said i'm believing for a blessing but i'm looking financially and i said lord i know you will provide and then you know he put on my heart to sing i have a source and it's a song from brother biscuit church and as i said that song has been a blessing to me during the coffee times and i decide okay i'll sing it but i didn't practice it so we were practicing i was singing it in the car and girls join in with me and that's how we end up singing together but nowhere in my heart i was expecting a spiritual blessing i was looking for a natural blessing so this is where the fight came in and for the last two weeks the devil has just been battling me telling me that you're not worthy i look at you you're nothing you make mistakes per stephen was wrong and whole and negative and it's just been so much that it was just overwhelming and said you're a hypocrite you're nothing so this morning when i got up i said lord jesus i'm gonna take everything and put it aside and i'm gonna walk you may use me one time and never again and that's it but if you this is your will let me sanctify my life i know it's not of works unless any man should boast but lord i'm putting me aside and whatever you want to do i got up early and i'm getting ready for church and everything just keep falling behind and i say why can't i leave this house you know eventually i was able to leave and i thank the lord and you know i got up i was listening to wednesday night sermon and getting in the spirit and everything and then i walked into victory's mind so it was like i thank god for giving me the victory i thank god for the song that follow created me a new heart and i just thank god for the worship and you know for placing me where he has placed me because it's it's just so you know sometimes you think oh this person testifies so much but it's just that every single time you feel down he give you exactly what you need to just lift you up and i just thank god for the ministry we were on we are under for the word you know we see the songs lining up we see the testimonies lining up we see the special lining up you know we see the the in front everything just falling in line and all i can do is just throw up my hands and say thank you jesus [Applause] hallelujah now one first of all says you know the devil's a liar so if he's attacking you he's telling you lies amen and he wouldn't lie to you like that unless he knew you were one of god's children he's trying to convince you that you're not so don't listen to him sing a song for jesus when that happens just start singing now um you didn't mention one thing that you're you are actually or were a part of you you mentioned all these things but she didn't mention the gifts coming into the church it he used you about two weeks ago with the gift of knowledge that you had no knowledge of that our pastor had received his healing before you came up and sang that song and if you go back and watch she just stops in the middle of the song and goes not brother stephen because it wasn't her talking it was god through her and he says she said stephen you are healed and then she the anointing got on her so much that she was just and then it just it stopped and she started singing again so the gifts are coming into this church we we each listen we each get attacked we're each told we're not unworthy everybody here okay so you call somebody but we also each have a gift we have a purpose and it might be like she said it might be a one-time thing but just live for jesus believe the word believe the message and live for jesus anybody have a prayer request or another praise report before we um we don't want to take a whole lot of brother stephen's time yes ma'am sister sharon we want to give god glory amen god bless you i just want to thank god because in 2019 around my sister waiting time to receive a call that my daddy was really sick then he had to travel to south africa to get some treatment so when he went there like after a month one of my brother called me from europe he said we should get ready because the doctor said daddy might die in five months or three or three months so it was really bad but i went praying i told my brother i'm not ready for daddy to die now so we'll be praying so i called daddy i told daddy daddy what the lord told brother branagh if you will if you bring people to believe in you even cancer will not resist you daddy do you believe the message you say yes you believe brother branham daddy say yes so i told daddy hold on to that cancer will not kill you so he has been under treatment last week i just received a message that the treatment went well my dad is completely healed i thank god for that praise the lord hallelujah glory even cancer amen does anybody have a prayer request this morning before we go before the lord uh my wife's dad also is he's very old and he's already kind of throwing up little flags you know that he's i think that he's you know approaching the end she may be making a trip here in the next couple of months to do her part um she's the baby and he always figured he should you know be there and take care of him at the end so we're going to do our part to help him out but just his name is gabriel so just remember remember him as well um brother angelo would you come up and pray for the for the uh and everybody i'm sure has an unspoken we can lift our hands up and acknowledge that yes sir the building fund today okay listen and brother david and i were talking we didn't discuss amounts but we we talked about you know the board budget came up quite a bit i would like to see us exceed those and just you know just do what we can because the lord deserves the best and we do too i mean it's not you know gold you know gold all that but just adequate more than adequate maybe with the sound or with you know the instruments so just you know do as the lord leads you in uh given thank you let's buy our hearts god we just want to thank you for bringing us here today i just want to thank you for waking us up because that's not the opportunity you gave everybody god give us one more try jesus christ to bring us closer to you jesus

seth has a special this morning and then we're going to cut the pastor loose and let him preach his heart out this morning amen in fact my wife was supposed to sing but um she's lost her voice amen and we just want to do this song to give glory to the lord she's been through a lot but the lord has always been with us amen so uh this week um this song was in my heart i've been trying to to do it today amen how can i say thanks for the things you have done for me face so undeserved what do you give to prove your love for me the voices of the million angels cannot especially [Music] all that i

hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord come on in my brother good to see you i don't want to call your name so people will turn around one of our family members amen we praise the lord to see you all amen you came right on time when it's time for food [Laughter] that's the right time to get amen i believe they already remind you about the building fund the house meeting laws willing in brady jones porter on the 17th and question and answer the purple box is back there amen how many listen to the sermon on wednesday amen okay praise the name of the lord i believe you're not going to be behind if you didn't you got to hang tight thank you very much the musician for everything and good to see you brother said helping with the keyboard god richly bless you amen let's go straight to the scripture on wednesday we explain to you a big key in the message because we were going through some of the avenue of the black dog touching this touching makeup touching eye paint and before i get into the high heel and everything else and somebody turn around and say like we back again to these legalistic stuff so we gotta give you a key you understand it's not about legalistic stuff it is nothing but the grace of god separating you from the work of the heathen amen if you take it like legalistic then you get trouble then it's going to be like do's and don'ts and one of this day you say we were in bondage in the message you were not in bondage you just missed the key amen every single nation upon the planet earth including the jews were all pagan they were gentile abraham was a hidden a heathen another worshiper amen and paul the great apostle came and condemned the gentile condemn the jews and put both of them on the same level amen telling you that we all sin and came short of the glory of god so nobody should boast amen so what i did to the jewish people i'm just doing the same thing to the gentiles amen showing you that i just use a jews as a door amen when boaz was redeeming naomi boaz was not thinking about marrying naomi boaz was thinking about marrying roof but to get roof you got you you must pass through naomi so to get the gentile you're going through israel but the very purpose of god is not really the jews it's a gentile brother because the jews themselves were also gentile so now out of every kindred every nation every tongue he begin to pull his children out amen so it's not about legalistic it's not about putting you under the law because the law failed amen it's about god separating you from hiddenness that's the key you get it then everything else won't be a problem amen you get the god of variety and then everything else won't be a problem every coat they can bring you about mixed marriages will never trouble you if you understand the god of variety he wants you to be the way you are the way he created you stay in your category and if you want to get married get married in your category [Applause] because when you get married in your category you continue to preserve what he started so it's not about being racist it is the god of variety [Music] amen if you understand that key no no i don't see any any quote you can bring it to me amen and brother branham keeps saying we are like a bouquet we are like a bouquet we don't want to mix marriages he keeps saying that and people miss it because the country was already infected by racial spirit amanda instead of understanding i created you black i want you black i created you white i want you white i want you to stay that way stay in that category love it cherish it are creating you asians stay like that it is not that i'm separating you no i can say a certain statement here but it's going to go people on amen amen i keep it for the local church amen bring me any quote any quote i'm going to show you it all line up with the god of variety your prophet is perfectly in line with the scripture you miss that key oh why we don't want god to marry white people why we don't want to marry hispanic it's not a problem go back to the mind of god look if he wanted you to be black he would have created your wife if he wants you african he would have created you in africa if he wanted you european you're going to be born in europe [Music] just accept it be proud of it be happy the god of variety you don't understand that you're going to have trouble in heaven because when you get in heaven you're going to see african you want to see white people black people asian hispanic what are you going to do what are you going to do there won't be any other world the only other place will be held but even in hell it's mixed heaven mixed hell mixed where are you gonna go troubling yourself for nothing put your car in your chair amen let's go to exodus chapter 19 that's why people miss the prophet and they got in trouble and later on you're going to hold on hold on hold on hold on one day you bastard you can't take it anymore oh i leave the message we were in bondage no you're going back to heaven you're going back to hedonism hang tight you're going to see what's going on exodus chapter 19 verse 4 if you dare you can say amen hallelujah you have sinned what i did to the egyptian i love to preach like that amen to the egyptian amen and how i bore you in other words i carried you on eagle water when israel was coming out of egypt how many seeing an ego can an ego carry two million of people in their wings not even one probably maybe two three the ego will be already heavy so where was the wing of the ego you need a prophet amen when god brought israel out he gave them a try as a nation he plugged them up in egypt amongst the water unbelievers and brought them in his tender care on the wings of the water come on that great water come on what is his name amigo is a professor i carry you under the wings of an eagle means i carry you under a prophetic ministry i use a prophet to carry you out of egypt all the way to the promised land it is not a burden amen hallelujah verse 4 i bore you on the ego's wings which was moses that great prophet and brought you to water so even though god use a powerful ministry you might be seated the purpose of that ministry is not to bring the people to the prophet that's why brother branham said under no circumstances did i have a ministry to bring the people unto me but i use a prophet to unite you with me it takes a prophet to bring you unto me if you want to be united with god you need a prophet because a prophet is the one that marry you to the king he is the officer that officiated the marriage why he didn't go himself and then god pick israel and say get married to me he said moses you take off your shoe let me borrow your shoe amen when you look sometimes you say is this moses or is it who is this moses or is it no it's just moses i'm just using him to bring you to me how do you want to get married without a prophet i'm going to the marriage supper you need a prophetic ministry amen now therefore verse 5 if you will obey my voice indeed and keep my covenant then you shall be a water a peculiar a special people this promise was given to israel not gentile if they obey they're going to be a peculiar or a special people who everybody want to be like israelite we want to be special in the eyes of god a peculiar water not only just are you peculiar are you special but a peculiar treasure whoa you want to be the treasure of god to me above water all the people in other words all the earth was under hidden is god pick up the jews get them out and elevate them above everybody as a peculiar and all special treasure blessed be the name of the lord for all the earth israel is mine amen verse 6 and you shall be to me a water a kingdom of priest not only are you a peculiar people but you become a kingdom a kingdom of water so everybody in that kingdom is a priest oh my god a holy holiness holiness a holy nation in other words a nation that is different than any kind of nation upon the first earth remember on wednesday you remember on wednesday when balaam looked at israel he says when i look at the at the map of the nation of the earth when i look at israel spiritually i don't see them in the earthly map they are not reckoners among the nation but if you go you're going to see a country israel you're going to see a natural people israel you're going to see them with a with a king but when you look at them spiritually you don't see them amen every kingdom under the dominion of the devil that's why in matthew 4 the devil told jesus christ look at all the kingdom i will give it to you if you bow down to me but when they look at israel he's missing on the map of the devil i am just using the jew to show you an example a sample of what i want to do when i pull you from the gentile there is no way that from hell there is no red dot from hell that can detect you when hell zero down to your house it's blur block block they can zero your neighbor they can zero their neighbor they can zero damage but when they're there for when demon crosses your neighborhood when they come close to your house the gps is lost [Music] [Applause] hallelujah the gps signal is lost amen and they get a warning you don't fly over this property are you there except you get permission if you don't leave the premises we're gonna shoot the rocket [Music] what are you scared about what are you scared about you cannot be detected that's why the bible says when you sleep your sleep will be sweet because there is no red dial around your property you can sleep like a baby and you wake up and you are fine because the glory of israel shall not sleep no slumber god 24 hours is looking at your house like this hallelujah when the bride knows her position the king of israel he doesn't sleep he doesn't slumber he's always watching like this when the demons are coming they forbidden zone forbidden zone go to the neighbor over there they're drinking whiskey not in my father's house hallelujah hallelujah amen amen many many men and many many many many man when you coming they ask you a permission who are you i'm an angel gabriel you can pass if you need a message go give them a dream god give them an answer but if it's from the kingdom of god of hell you need a permission that's why the devil taught job when i look at you i see a fence around you he said job i see a fence around you god said the jews he said yes because every time i pass there is an invisible face around job you cannot touch job you cannot touch his children you cannot touch his business you cannot touch his car you cannot even touch his chair hallelujah brother branham chair that was under payment to us in the sixth dimension you don't even touch his chair oh my god if you know your god you're going to sleep in peace amen my god and you shall be to me a kingdom of water karma a holy not among the other nations these words are the word which you shall speak to who the children of israel what a special promise to the children of israel oh we are not born israelite what are we going to do let's go to leviticus 25 i was not born of jews i wish lord i was born a jew i wish i was under this covenant can i go to israel and change my nationalities you don't have to you're wasting your time amen leviticus 25 israel peculiar special treasure kingdom of priests a holy nation not reckon among any nation especially above all the people of god god can you give israel a task give them a position i want to know what is the position of such a special people like this when i see a special people a treasure of god a nation like israel so when they are coming to god when god look at them he say israel come sit on my lap amen there's only two people that can sit on the lap of a man when the lion roareth there are two creatures that are not scared the car lion and the wife of a lion the lion can roar he wants the cow but sleeping only two categories can sleep on the lap of a man either you his wife are you his children leviticus 25 amen let's go to verse 38. i am the lord your god which brought you forth out of the land of who he's talking to who israel to give you the land of canaan and to be your my god he want to be their god and if your brother that you are by you what's poor a jew and be so to you you shall not compel him to serve as a water so even though one of your brother a jew become your servant you must treat him differently hallelujah but verse 40 as a higher servant and as a sir journal he shall be with you and shall shall serve you to the year of water in other words you cannot hold him forever i gotta release him amen and then he shall depart from you everybody clear both he and his children with him and shall return to his own family and to the possession of his father shall he return verse 42 for they are my water oh my god these people israel i thought they were special i thought they are peculiar people a kingdom of priest a holy nation when god positioned them servant brother branham said israel are god servant did he ever give you the scripture the prophet like this with the bible for they are my water servants which are brought forth out of the land of egypt they shall not be sold as born men all the effort did for israel to bring them a prophet to pull them out of egypt and destroy the kingdom of egypt all the infiltrating all the demonstration of the plagues and my power all of that was just to rescue his servant verse 43 you shall not rule over him with water that's why you're gonna find a nicolaitan spirit is oh wrong i'm gonna show you if we get time amen when you're ruling among the israelites you don't rule over them with rigor you must be careful how you reign over them you must be careful how you pastor them you cannot pastor israel like a dictator you must be gentle but shall fear your god buff your bondsmen and your bounty made which you shall have shall be of the water you see the separation again everybody that you must be yelling at them hidden not jews that are around about you and them shall you buy bond men and bond mates moreover of the children of the stranger that do sojourn among you of them you shall buy and of their families that are with you which they father in your land and they shall be your what possession verse 46 and you shall take them as an inheritance for your children after you to inherit them for a possession in other words everybody that is a gentile you can own them and your children continue to own them but not a jew a jew you only use him up to a certain limit in the year of jubilee he whether he still owe you money or not you gotta free him amen there shall be your bond man for what forever so when you are hidden you are a bond man in israel you remain a bondsman forever oh my god but over your brethren the children of israel you shall not rule one over another with water no severity upon the jews you must be very careful how you handle a jew anybody clear job to verse 55 for to me the children of water israel are water they are my servant whom i brought forth out of the land of egypt i am the lord your god everything god did was to redeem a servant not a bride not a child not sons and daughter of god amen let's go to psalm chapter 137 and you're gonna see when we've when we shift to the gentile you're gonna remember this word peculiar holy kingdom of priests and you're going to see how god will call the gentile the gentile church and you're going to see what he call israel and how he's calling it gentile amen psalm 135 verse 4 then we're going to pray if you dare you can say amen for the lord has chosen who which is israel to who now you understand what it means and israel for his peculiar water again back again but when paul comes he condemned them let's pray heavenly father lord once again we thank you for your grace you love your mercy father and for everything you have been doing for us lord we were alienated from you hidden pagan unbelievers gentile call by those of the circumcision and circumcised father we look like we were lower than a certain category of the people lord he took grace that came lord father manifested in the office of the sonship as the lord jesus christ father to break the bonds of separation that wall of partition that was between the gentiles and the jews father you broke that completely and you brought us together into one body father we thank you for that power of redemption lord being revealed through the message of the hour we thank you for your children coming this morning lord father gathering together around the revealed word of the hour lord we are committing this service unto the hand sealing the devil completely outside and may only the holy spirit and the angel of the lord be into this building to bless and to minister to your children to deliver and to heal to touch lord and to feel in the name of jesus christ amen god bless you good to see you this morning since the majority is catching up so we good we on parts 27 dealing with the black dog genesis 2 verse 9 and in genesis 3 verse 6 and 7 the bible says that out of the ground made the lord god to grow every tree that is water so from the garden of eden every tree that was in the garden of eden was pleasant everybody follow me and he was present to the site because god is the one that created it and he was also water good for food every single tree including the fig tree hallelujah amen the tree of life also in the midst of the garden and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil out of every single tree there was only one tree that god forbid men to eat that was the tree of the knowledge of water good and evil every other tree are either born or commenstable you can eat as you want verse 16 and the lord god commanded the man saying of every tree only the exception of the tree of the knowledge of good of evil of every tree of the garden you may eat water freely is given to you now in genesis chapter 3 verse 7 6 and 7 and when the woman saw that the tree was good for food and that he was pleasant to the eyes the eyes of god the eyes of who the woman okay and the tree to be desired in other words a tree that causes lust to make one wise we already seen the two wisdom on wednesday she took off the fruit thereof and did eat and gave also on to her husband with her and he did it both of them ate the forbidden fruit and the eyes of both of them were water so that tree opened or removed the holy veil that god put upon them and when the holy veil was removed they only became conscious of their nakedness they were not conscious because they were tall they were not conscious because their texture was white or black or asian they only became conscious of something nakedness and they knew that they were naked that's why this fruit brought to them and they saw fig leaves so there is a tree in the garden of eden called the fig tree that tree had leaves and that tree also has fruit are you following me god told them that every tree is pleasant good for food you can eat that freely god gave them permission to use the fruit not the leaves hallelujah and they used the fig leaves they saw fig leaves together and made themselves welcome so by the knowledge the earthly knowledge the perverted knowledge of the devil ever clear they used that perverted wisdom and that perverted wisdom taught them to use their leaves of a tree and to make unto them apron which is temporarily because the leaves are going to be green and sooner they're going to dry up which is the top of your fashion that comes and go everybody clear so far let's go to ezekiel chapter 16 hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord amen oh my god ezekiel chapter 16. everybody there few people everybody there verse 3 and say that says the lord god to who jerusalem your birth and your nativity is of the land of canaan your father is an amorite he's an amorite jew thank you and your mother is a high title is a high-tatted jew so the birth of jerusalem here is talking of a birth of a gentile a hidden not a jew like the way you feel everybody clear job to verse uh eight now when i pass by you and look upon you behold your time was the time of love america in the garden of eden the tree of the knowledge of good and evil opened the eyes of them to be conscious of their nakedness and the opening of the eyes brought their consciousness not to your heart but the consciousness to your nakedness so when your eyes become open or when the black dog is released in your life it will begin to tempt you in your outer upper appearance are you following me now here from birth nothing happened now it's not birth you know clearly that it's puberty which is the time of love when your time of love was come and i spread my skirt over you and i cover your nakedness and i saw to you yeah i saw it to you and enter into a covenant with you we already explained this say the lord and you became mine verse 9 then i did water when the time of puberty came god began to get concerned about the proper care of this woman all their home care amen we already explained to you check your your bathroom check your living room if it's still dirty we need to call me so we can cast that devil amen because the preaching of the word come to cast that devil if it didn't work then we got to go manual you're not automatic we got to put you on the manual shift amen then i wash you with water yeah i thoroughly wash away your blood we already explained this and i have anointed you with water it's still talking about the proper care it is the washing of the body and not only do you watch you need the lotion all in the scripture [Laughter] right here in the scripture you don't only wash you also need the lotion in your bible you see just a little tweak in your eyes amen and i have anointed you with oil i clothe you also with embroidered work so at puberty number one god is looking at the proper care of this child number two god is also concerned about the clothing because when the eyes of adam and eve were opening the garden of eden the devil already anointed them with a different wisdom to take care of their natural body and they use the leaves of the fig tree but when god came god used an animal called the lamb brother brother said that animal was a lamb do you follow me and that lamb we found out that in the book of proverbs hallelujah hallelujah from birth i clove you with him broad at work and i did water i showed you he's also concerned not about your clothing only but about your shoes did i fabricate something okay and i showed you with badger skin there is a key to that and i girded you still the clothing about with flymen fine linen and i cover you with sleek silk in other words the clothing they are putting here are expensive what is going on verse 11 i deck you with ornament now god is concerned about jews you see brother stephen god himself put him i know when i was looking at that black dog keep coming i said he's gonna get somebody here and he would say the pastor never read down there he always stopped there tell your pastor to read down there i caught him the gps called him and bring it to me say kill him amen i thank you with ornament joe and i put water which is a part of the jewelry we already talked to you man you need to get your bracelet off in the scripture it's bended amen a bracelet upon your hand and a chain on your water necklace amen and i put a jewel upon your forehead and the water so why are you in bed see now and a beautiful crown we found that stay with a chrono still part of the jewelry amen beautiful crown verse now 13 give you the summary thus you were dead with water it's giving you the material you there i use witch material and water there that's you were decked with gold and silver and your helmet was of what we know it means the righteousness of the same but let's kill the black dog amen and what silk expensive and brothers work you did eat water number five is concerned about your diet because when we come teenager we begin to eat anything [Music] amen it looks like something is turned on especially boys they can finish a whole pizza but they are not there i used to play basketball i know amen and oh and you did eat fun flour and honey and oil and you were exceeding beautiful and you did prosper into your kingdom and your renown went forth among the who not the jews for your beauty for it was perfect through my communists which i have put on you it's god that put this brother stephen if this were put by gods why are they wrong you ready now let's take our flight you ready amen in first timothy chapter 2 verse 9 and 10 in like manner also that who this woman in ezekiel 16 was he a boy or a woman in like money also women adorned themselves in water power is contradicting ezekiel 16. the prophet paul who said if anybody speaks something contrary to me let that person be a curse he says the appeal of a woman must be modest paul you didn't read the old testament adult themselves in modest apparel with water same fairness and water so your clothing must be a must be coupled with a certain spirit because god clothes them with a lamb which was speaking about himself the lamb of god so when people see you not only do they see your clothes but they also see the nature of a lamb with you a nature that is meek modesty plus nature of a lambo dress code are you there come semicolon or whatever you call it can you read it with me and ot what does he mean with water see why you need a prophet if you take this you put it in the sister will be in trouble but i'm going to explain this later are you there not with water or whatever in ezekiel 16 which material they use why is paul condemning that note oh god or what oh water he's attacking ezekiel 16. paul a misogyny doesn't like women but which becometh women professing water paul is more looking of the inside person with water more than ever the character paul let's look at peter the one who they handed the key to the gentile because paul was an apostle to the gentile but peter was handed the key he's the one that went and preached to the gentile and the holy ghost came peter what do you think about what paul is saying likewise you who women or men okay if you say man we gotta cast out the devil amen likewise you wives be in subjection to your own husband that if any obey not the word there also with your preaching not only are they forbidden to preach in church may also without the water be won by water in other words a woman should bring somebody to christ more by her conduct her life you can testify don't sit there breaking the seals and there are some men without the word be warned by the conversation of the wife so the man just sitting and watch you watch you watch you after a while he take the beer and he throw it away without one shot without coming you hidden in jesus name wow there behold do you remember that woman that the husband was a drunkard do you remember that story and the joker was sitting with his friend they said there is no christian the drunkard begin to testify he said i no one that is my wife a homo the other one said no no no no no let's go home and let her preach for us are you there when they got home they begin to act crazy in the house the woman never preached a sermon are you there she just behaved as a woman cooking food and the food she's cooking is converting people [Applause] because she is in her position she is in the kitchen and when you are in your position there is power are you there she begin to cook the food the holy ghost anointed him and bring a song to her heart and she begin to just sing the song sister lorell and three drunker at the altar without a preacher are you there so while they behold your chest conversation that conversation means your life coupled with water respect who's adorning let it what this is not paul anymore if you want to kill paul you kill peter are you there not be that outer adorning of planting of water and of wearing water and putting on water peter comes and contains ezekiel 16. why are these guys attacking that and let it be they want them just like paul they are more focused about this guy the nature oh my god i don't know how i went that far that was too fast amen and let it be the hidden man of the water in that which is not water even on the ornament of water your jew is a meek and a quiet water which is in the sight of god of a water it is greater price than your watch after this manner the old time and the water and the holy women also who trusted in god i don't water in other words all the old christian women they were focusing more on the nature of the inside versus their outer appearance so what is going on in ezekiel 16. in ezekiel 16 god told you that at the age of teenager of puberty your sex hormones open up are you there when the sex hormone open up you gonna be tempted in certain area are you there then god begin to point to you the area you're going to be tempted with do you follow me now god is telling you once you become conscious once you begin to see your period once your voice deepens once you begin to have hair in your private part then you're gonna start seeing that you need a certain type of hygiene you follow me now you follow me now ezekiel 16 give you the area where the black dog will attack you and puberty jesus do you follow me you're gonna be attacked on your personal care are you there when you were a leader mama was taking care of your room mama was cleaning your clothes mama was doing everything when you grow up a little bit mama back up and if you don't watch you want to see a boy or a girl begin to develop a certain habit of disorder they get in the bedroom they put stuff here they put stuff here they put stuff here it is a teenager temptation if you didn't do that raise your hand also now say amen okay are you there the second area god tells you is you gonna be tempted on your clothing and your shoes lord give me time to get on the shoes today you're going to be tempted by jews you're going to be tempted with stuff of gold and silver and you're going to be tempted with the way you eating if you don't pay attention you're going to can't wait suddenly quicker and then you find yourself overweight all of those are created by your hormone did we get it there everybody clear if you miss to understand this area satan is coming with a different veil once satan brings the veil not the holy veil of adam and eve it is called the last veil we explain that on wednesday then once the last veil hits you're gonna find yourself begin to be interested in those kind of stuff just know you're under attack everybody clear we explained this on wednesday brother branham said jonah turn over in the wealth building look away toward the temple the best that he knowed toward the top of the well and begin to pray and god turned that big fish around he was a prepared fish took him right straight to nineveh in babylon for a purpose now we believe that most of the ninevite must have been backslidden and have went off i read a story one time where many of them had turned to water hedonism and they were worshiping water so when jonah came to nineveh he found a last veil on the people of nineveh they didn't know even how to discern good from evil are you there if you take a little child that is born if you give them two shoes their shoes do you know how they wear their shoes do you know how they wear their shoes they will take their left shoe and put it on the right they take the right and put it on the left it is the sign that they are still under the veil they don't know how to descend there right from left when they begin to grow up then they begin we are the one telling them this here put this put this and the more you put it by the power of repetition it get in their subconscious then automatically they begin to fix it if you don't do it you're gonna see them waking up they can put any kind of dress and they're going to church it's you who they hey come here we got to fix your hair they don't care about it but once they're teenager you don't tell them to fix their hair before they come to church automatically they sit down and they go like this 20 minutes on a mirror what makes you love the mirror a teenager why do you like the mirror a teenager why do you turn around and walk in your bathroom and turn around and walk in the bathroom why do you do that you are under the territory of the black dogger are you there you are doing things you don't understand why and if somebody don't train you right the last veil is waiting for you right there before you know it you begin to do things to attract men you begin to get picture to attract men you begin to push things to attract young lady because you fell under the last veil are you there are you there before you know it you put a bracelet here tomorrow you have three bracelets tomorrow you have five jewels tomorrow you have seven jewels tomorrow you have this tomorrow high heel you don't understand why you are doing that all of them were described in ezekiel 16. you don't do that by any chance because the black dog is turned on and when he comes he's attacking you in those area and when he's turned off at meadow paws he's going to come again and attack you in the same area you're going to see that later why is a woman in menopause beginning to make herself more cute have you seen that have you seen that why is she doing that why she got married she put her car in neutral in menopause she got back again in emmanuel she acted like she's a little girl again why is she doing that because the hormones are turned off it is the hormone that triggers this when they are turned off they also goes back and then revisits this area that's why the woman unconsciously because somebody is telling you you owed you owed you're getting old you're getting old so now she's trying to fight it now she think to make herself younger the black dog is staying ready i'm going to prove to you by the court everybody here this message is something when you look at the fig tree we spoke that the fig tree heaven leaves and the fruit tree have the fruit god never gave permission to the leaves he gave only permission to the fruit in georges chapter 9 verse 10 and 11 the bible says and the tree said to the fig tree come down and reign over us but the fig trees say unto them should i forsake my water so the fig tree by the scripture have a sweet fruit amen and my water good fruit only confirm what genesis say because every tree that was created was what pleasant good for food judges keep that same line everybody clear should i forsake my my sweetness and my good fruit and go to be promoted over the trees so we understand by this scripture that there is nothing wrong with the fig fruit the problem is the leaves mark 11 13 and 14 jesus coming and was hungry and begin to pass by at fig tree and seeing a fig tree why did jesus only was interested in the fig tree why was not jesus interested in an apple tree why was not jesus interested in a sycamore why was jesus on me interested in a fig tree and why among all the trees of the garden of eden adam and eve were only interested in a fig tree why they didn't take their leaves from a mango tree hallelujah and seeing a fig tree not by any hazard adam was the first adam and jesus was the walker are you there are you there the first adam went to the fig tree by the second adam who brings redemption must also go to the center to the fig tree are you there what is he gonna do to the fig tree is he gonna use the fig tree are you there are you there hallelujah this message is something hallelujah and he happened and seeing a fig tree a fire of having water what attracted jesus to the tree was the leaves what attracted adam to the tree was their leaves if you still doubting open your scripture and read it are you there and seeing a fig tree a fire of having water jesus look he saw a fig tree he look he have lips he said no okay let me go handle this stuff i came for redemption are you there he came if happily in other words perhaps he might find amy darron was jesus god the son of god is who do you think jesus did not know that there was no fruit in that tree we already proved to you that jesus was god unto us a son is born his name shall be called counselor comforter priest of priests and what mighty god how can a son be a god everlasting water how can a son be a father hallelujah and he happily if happily he might find anything thereof what was jesus looking for he was looking for fruit because he was hungry and man in the garden of eden was given fruit that are free to eat he's working in the vision of eden are you there and then and when he came to it he found what but what jesus made sure that when he comes to that tree he doesn't want to deal with the fruit because nothing was wrong with the fruit and the fruit of the fig tree are good and they are sweet adam never used the fruit are you there and he found nothing but what for the time of what was what jesus have to come at the season that the fruit has spared because he needed to curse what man use he doesn't want to curse the fruit so he make sure when the season that the leaves are up not the fruit that's the time he comes in other words i'm taking what is good out let me show men what he did in the garden of eden and jesus answered and said to it how can you talk to a tree that too talk are you there and jesus answered and said to it no man eat water of thee hear water and his disciple heard it jesus did what he cursed the leaves are you there and the tree withered brother branham job first if i have seen any perish for want of water remember in the garden of eden when god came he saw man using the fig tree amen god was not pleased with the fig leaves god went and used a lamb and covered them and solomon came he said lambs were for what covering look at job if i have seen any parish who want clothing or any poor without water covering if his lords have not blessed me and if he were not water warm with water the fleece of water the clothing god use in the garden of eden not only do they clothe your body but they also keep you warm when it's cold the dress code you must wear must cover your body and must be able to protect you from cold weather when it's winter marriage and divorce also we can see here plainly this vulgar ungodly filthy program that we have on television of holy o hollywood secretary said sex queens we can see the filth of this city and these kids little old girls walking up and down in other words teenager up and down the street here with this welcome let it be the water twisting around and it's cold enough to do whatever the fig leaves fashion is not proper even for the weather are you understanding me little bitty clothes but they're freezing but because they're going to the nightclub they gotta wear them fig tree are you there freeze them to death they don't know that it's what they're there for doing that they are possessed of an evil spirit and the word don't know if you wander a different veil are you there but there is another tree somewhere and he showed me a pure river of water of life clear as crystal proceeding out of the throne of god and of the lamb in the midst of the street of it and on either side of the river was the tree of water which bare water every month that we have fruit it is not a fig tree that is seasonal are you there every month he break fruit and you did have fruit every month and her water off the treeway for water they leaves of the tree of life is for the healing not to cover your sin and to keep exposing your nakedness even though you think you are covered do we get it my god the blessed be the name of the lord we found god called abraham and abraham left in genesis 12 he left the city of earth and he went to the land of canaan ever cleared then god gave abraham a promise he's going to be the father of many nations ever clear so far in galatians on wednesday we found out that that promised seed was crushed and then in roman we found that power when he came he condemned the jews he condemned the gentiles but when we look at abraham abraham was a hidden do you remember that you say brother stephen we are not hidden what is a hidden the people are in the spirit of the last day just like there was in the days of noah eating drinking marrying giving in marriage and concern don't care walk around and anything else and these american people is the worst on the face of the earth heading high-minded incontinent fierce despiser know it all i know i know i know if there is any place in the world with my bible over my heart and god knowing that looking down on me and knowing i may have to stand before him before him before morning if i had to say so the place needs missionaries worst than any place in the world is the world united states of america the united states of america the greatest bunch of water that i know of everywhere is in water hidden means water [Music] he that means what if you're sleeping you need to stand everybody clear roman paul condemned and paul proved to us that not only was abraham a hidden but abraham also was a non-circumcised gentile the key on wednesday was that god is trying to separate you from hedonism or from gentile lifestyle everybody clear now this is where we were why hallelujah god want to separate you from that why act 26 i have appeared today for this purpose to make them minister and a witness but to these things which that has seen and of those things in which we were i will appear unto them delivering this from the water these people were the jew we okay now paul is saying here that when i come to you god is saying to paul actually that when i'm coming to you paul i found you hooked in the hebrew lord you were hooked in the hebrew law and you were also hooked as a gentile you understand i want to deliver you from two things i want to deliver you from your jewish custom or from the law and i want also to deliver you from water a gentile a hidden means water unbeliever an unbeliever is a sinner right go back in your scripture paul say i am the chief of sinner are you there delivering this from the people and from the gentile unto whom are now sending you sending me to gentile wives to open water so gentiles by nature are blind you follow me not that you don't see spiritual blindness and to turn them from water gentle living darkness american every nation that lucifer show jesus live under this and from the power of water they live under the power of satan so this bloodness this darkness is nothing but the anointing of satan everybody clear unto god that they may receive forgiveness of sin an inheritance among them which are what sanctified by faith like abraham that is in what in me paul in galatians 1 14 and profited in the jews religion above my water in my own nation being more exceedingly zealous of the tradition of what paul was bound by a religion demon the worst one banning american people are you a christian i'm a baptist are you a christian i'm a methodist are you a christian i am this amen in the feast of the trumpet in revelation 11 their ministry will be the ministry of moses and elias calling to israel out of the water do you see what moses said elijah does just as the seven and just message the bride out of the water paul was jewish the bride is from the what pentecostal tradition and what remember moses and elijah is to call them out of the old atonement of the lamb and sheep and blood and goats and sacrifice to the real living sacrifice to the world and the seven angel message under the same trumpet the seventh trumpet same thing the same seal the seventh seal called the people the bride out of the water and the water you understand word pagan heathen gentile unbeliever and circumcised make sense the message of brother branham called the bride out of the water religious and out of the water to the genuine atonement the word christ impersonated in his word made flesh among us so when brother branham gives you instruction he's not bringing you back to legalism he's actually separating you from the pentecostal tradition and is separating you from the world tradition of pagan or hidden or gender or unbeliever or uncircumcised everybody clear so far everybody cleared so far now let's go to act chapter 15. now we on the plateau yeah we good if you dare you can say amen why does god want to separate us from a gentile number one the gentiles are blinded by lucifer number two the gentile live in darkness number three they live under the power of satan why acts chapter 15 verse 14 if you dare you can say amen simeon has declared how god has first did visit the water there was a discussion about the circumcision you can read this at home to take out of them a people for water remember israel was redeemed to be servant but god wanted a wife are you there now his wife was not the jewish he was not an army he have to be rude to a gentile so he goes through naomi in order to get roof so god now is going to the gentile to take a people for his name's sake because the wife must carry the same name of the husband that's why brother branham said i'll call you mrs jesus you gather first uh 15 and to this agree the words of the prophet as it is written after this i will return and i will build again the tabernacle of david which is fallen and i will build again the rune thereof and i will set it up that the residue of men must seek after the lord remember it's the residue he pulled israel out and everybody who remain is the residue everybody clear that the residue of men must seek after the lord and all the water not the jews upon whom my name is what the name of the lord will be called upon the gentile says the lord who does these things watch now no to god are all the words from the beginning of the world wherefore my sentence in other words my decision my judgment is this that we trouble them not who's those them the gentiles which from among the gentiles are turned to water there was a discussion whether the gentiles should be circumcised or not because jews are circumcised the president simeon say listen listen listen listen listen we already know there was a prophet there was a prophet that already spoke david gave us a promise we already know that god is gonna go to the gentile and pick up a people for his name's sake so now the gentile that are converted to christ let's not trouble them with the law anymore are you there but what are we going to tell them you there verse 20 but that we write to them that they abstain from water gentiles leave other under idolatry from where abraham came from that's why rachel having the terror of him that's why uh lebanon having diado jacob have to clean up his house removing the other because gentile are under idolatry okay abstain from pollution of adult come out and from water the spirit of a fornication is a gentile spirit you get it now what you need to tell the gentile because they live under blindness they live in darkness they live under the power of satan don't bring them back again to a religious demon you understand but tell them to come out from their lifestyle of idolatry their lifestyle of having sex before marriage are you there job to verse 27 and we sent therefore judas and salas who shall also tell you the same thing by month for it seems good to who now it's not simeon it seems good to the holy ghost and to us to lay upon you no greater burden than that than these necessary things the law become a burden that you abstain from meat offer to who from water blood and from the thing strange and from water from which if you keep yourself you shall do water with the instruction we give in you as gentile don't go under idolatry things that are sacrificed to adopt and don't also live under fornication because fornication funding a gentile let's go to ephesians 4. amen blessed be the name of the lord ephesians chapter 4 verse 17 why do we need to be delivered from a gentile why do we have to be delivered from our american custom why do we have to be delivered from our african our european our south american our canadian custom why you get it 17. this i said before and testify in the lord that you hereafter walk not as are they what walk come on in the water gentle walk in the vanity of the mind that's why the bible says the imagination of man's mind becomes continually evil that's why when god is separating you he wants you out of blindness out of darkness out of the power of satan out of the light of american adult out of fornication out of working with the vanity of your mind are you there karma having the understanding what darkened that's dental because you're already living under darkness being alienated from the life of god through the ignorance that is in water there is a spiritual ignorance in the gentile you see now you see why amen because of the blindness of the world you see these planets here their hearts are blinded that's why you go to roman one that blindness of the heart causes idolatry and they begin to make adults and worship them are you there verse 19 who being water a gentle love sound is beyond what a normal person should live sexually you are past feelings do you want to go back to the gentile do you see why americans act the way they act do you see why people in the night club in africa in europe do what they do they're like crazy maniaca are you there that's why they make pornography past feeling they can even met with a beast with a dog it's beyond it's a gentle lifestyle that's why paul get them out of blindness get them out of the darkness it is not law it is grace pulling you out are you there 19 who being past feelings have given themselves over to water lasciviousness to work all kind of water and water with greediness but you have not so learned who if so be that you have heard him and have been taught by him as the truth is in jesus that you pulled off concerning the former water lifestyle of the old man you used to be gentle which is corrupt according to the deceitful of what the gentile kingdom is based upon lustful love you get it now you get it now lust and building you in the spirit of your water and that you put on the water the new man which is after god is created in righteousness and true water this is the purpose of the message this is the purpose of the gospel i am only claiming you out from this lustful love to bring you back to a normal way of life everybody clear let's go to first thessalonians 4. amen you just follow you want to be grounded in the scripture first thessalonians 4 if you dare you can say amen first thessalonians 4 verse 3 you there for this is the will of god even your water why sanctification why does god want to clean you up because you're coming from a hidden even your sanctification that you should abstain from water do you remember in the book of acts it's a gentile lifestyle are you there that every one of you

get in your promised land in the baptism of the holy spirit when you drink the water of rephidim then joshua pick up the sword to do what you see now that's why paul said i died daily because the holy spirit the white dog is destroying every day he's getting territory you use not to come in church you begin to come in church you use not to pray you begin to pray it is the blood it is the white dog gaming territory until the devil will turn loose and don't know what to do with him hallelujah and you shall orderly destroy all the places wherein the nation which you shall possess serve the water

shall not do so unto the water what the way you treat the god of the hidden you don't treat me like that if it's my temple you'll be careful you follow me hallelujah take heed to yourself that you be not snare by following after them after that they have been destroyed from before thee and that door inquired after their god saying how did what save the water when you get to the promised land and when you destroy the god you destroy the altar you destroy everything never stop one time follow me carefully and begin to ask yourself a question how did this nation worship their god in other words what method did they use to worship their god how was their lifestyle of worshiping the lord their god if they were worshipping their god doing this then i'm gonna also do this to jehovah let me read it back again so he's gonna hit you how did this nation serve their god even so without water in other words you wanna take the worship of the heathen and bring them to god that's the root of catholicism catholicism took the roman tradition and put that in the church and god said don't take the stuff of the eden and mix it with my worship i am delivering you out of babylon out of the nomination adobe pentacles adobe baptist out of methodist don't bring the idea why are you coming to worship me shall not do so unto the who the lord that god for every abomination to the lord which he hated have dead done unto the water what you think was a worship is an abomination i don't want you to use that style to come and worship me do you follow me when you get to my temple don't worship me like hidden are you there that's why jesus said even when you pray don't multiply what then word like the who because they think by much repetition they shall be even in your way of praying i want you to be different than the gentiles are you there that's why we are against christmas [Music] do you want to go home do you want to go home do you want a plugin you ready we were never thought about christmas put your seat belt are you there why is christmas wrong why we come in a message church 25 years we were not told so and you battling with young people they want to do it they don't know nobody sat down to tell them why it's wrong it is what why do you reject it what is wrong with it let the bible talk not brother stephen jeremiah 10 verse 1 i wish brother robert was there hallelujah hear ye the word which the lord speak unto you all house of what how many people are the spiritual israel of god let me see your hand let me see your hand thank you jesus that said the lord learn not the way of the word what have i preached from son from wednesday up to today learn not the way of the hidden and circumcised gender pagan unbelievers what is the way of the hidden can you explain me more jeremiah and be not dismay at the son of heaven for the water i dismayed them for the custom of the people are what vanity of the man are you there what are the hidden doing for one cut a fat a what a tree out of water can you say amen come on the work of the hand of water people go cut a tree by the work of a man and bring that tree home and put it who was doing that according to the bible let me ask you a question is brother branham a guest christmas or it is the word who is against christmas it is not brother branham who's against mixed marriage it is the word it is not brother branham who's against christmas oh this message people they're against christmas you miss keys there are certain keys you must have to navigate in the message you miss if you just get hedonism you're going to navigate over everything in a message it is not a law from brother branham are you there for the custom of the people are vain one cut of a tree out of the forest and work the hand of a workman with the axe they do what they decorate they decorate the tree with water and water who do that is it a lord against christmas is it the law the bible says and decorated it with silver and gold they fasten it with water they put the tree and they hold it so the tree can stay like that because they cut it from the forest he then were doing that are you there and with hammer that he move what because if you leave that tree it's gonna fall are you there they are upright as the palm tree but they speak not they must need to be what you are the one carrying your christmas tree he cannot walk hidden because they cannot work them that's why christmas is wrong it is not wrong because it's a law it is not wrong because it's prada pranam it is wrong because it's a hedonism which is against the word of god are you there stop getting picture with the christmas tree you didn't know it before from today you know it don't be posting christmas stuff you are worshiping the devil without knowing it you are worshiping satan thinking you christian because satan knows how to play with satan knows how to play with beauty i don't believe christian but i'm just taking a picture because it looks beautiful you are identifying yourself with a hidden can you take a picture with a beer can you take a picture with a cigarette why are you taking a picture with a christmas tree why why why do you see brother branham and so did the second eve met her said nice sin giving it to a denomination creed accepted dogma instead of word the word taken down paganado like jupiter and so forth put up paul and barnabas took down the sun god and the moon god astrid the moon god with ron caution and made her being the mother of the sun god which is jupiter and changed the birthday of jesus christ from water jesus was born in april the roman catholic church removed that date and put it in december where they worship the sun god under a hidden tree and christian message believers are swallowing it hallelujah and they put a baby bone with the measures which is another line because the measure so jesus christ are two years old that's why erhu said kill the children two years old down you take the measures and the baby it's a lie the tree is hidden spoken word tabernacle stop this nonsense and every one of us place santa claus and decorate the trees and water now you understand brother branham after i show you tens of scriptures that's why brother branham said go home and study catch the man of the prophet he's against water it's not that he doesn't want you to get present it is you don't understand the devil is true hedonism and things like that and then call yourself what what's the matter with christian church god pull you out of hidden and here you go back to them the women buying their water what has this come to my how i can understand where a what has anything to do with the water is brother branham against easter brother his brother branham last sunday says that it's the best of all the days but what brother branham is pointing against you it is not easter he's pointing you about the begging stuff they are dead in water there's nothing wrong with brother charles he's going to pick up his wife so chill out are you there are you there so brother branham is not against easter but brother branham enter easter he said easter the date is correct the month is correct it's about the resurrection but my people i want to warn you about hiddenism they put a rabbit they put eggs those stuff have nothing to do with the scripture [Music] why a rabbit he start from germany it's the lutheran church that started the rabbit easter they came out from the catholic church and they killed santa and the devil brought the rabbit who's bringing gifts to the kids he changes santa claus to the rabbit you see what is the logo of the playboy what is the logo of the pornography channel and the pornography magazine what is the logo a rabbit go google don't enter there the logo of pornography channel and pornography magazine their logo is a rabbit why a rabbit sexually inclined beast and that's what they bring and couple that in history and message believers swallow it a rabbit has anything to do with the resurrection how a christmas tree has anything to do with the birth of christ it is what my friend we have got off the path somewhere but now a real born again man or woman realizes because there is life within you tell you what is what he's not against that easter he's against the paganism the protest but chris but christmas the date the time and everything is wrong easter the date is correct it's the paganism that brother branham is removing worship easter correct with it but remove the paganism are you there you don't go happy easter and you are putting all kind of picture is there what what does the resurrection of jesus christ have to do with your face when people see your face they see the resurrection that is good but even there they have no idea how to approach god and how to worship god jesus said that the true worship was in spirit and in water i'm gonna stop somewhere here i won't go through the through your high heel i'll let you soak this throughout the week and then when you come back we're gonna put up a chart and you're gonna see are you there but what kind of worship can you get in the church that knows soul leader of god and put up a santa claus at christmas and bunnies at easter where did they get that they got it from the water the water and made it a part of the water why god told you don't look at the ways of worshiping and worship me like that are you there but when one turns to the lord and is filled with water the holy ghost brother kelly he sees from water get the holy ghost and when joshua comes he's cutting your christmas and your easter bunnies are you there such thing he has rest in his soul he really begin to live and love god and worship who want to stop why brother that's pagan god never had an altar for easter flowers that is what who you see no more flowers are you there the world has got even easter christmas and everything else trigger tree trigger tree until it gets you to halloween where you are actually worshiping devils and christian trigger tree trigger tree trigger tree where did god taught you to worship the dead why do you seek among the dead who is what are you there christmas a great of commercial nothing about god in it what in the world this day got to do with a rabbit or a chicken or a yellow duck or something we are just as what as the water and now even what wasted day off in and yet you pulled up with it god help us to shine those things as the sunlight of god begin to breathe down and expose those things let's walk in the water as you got the teaching on that now you understand walk in the newness of life that god has showed you are you there let me skip this and i'm going to conclude with this trinity they don't believe there is true god that is what do you see god the father god the son god the holy ghost now absolutely there is no such a thing it's not true god that is what even in your deity it's coming from hidden are you there present your body a living sacrifice holy and acceptable unto god and his reasonable service be not confirmed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind that she may prove what is what and acceptable and water perfect will of who we are not preaching you the law we are not putting you on to a law we're not doing that we are just presenting you the word of the living god let's stand [Applause] how many called it how many called it the quota skip brother branham explained he says that we have to understand the little children it's in the quota skipped he said because the kids everybody is getting gift and they don't get gift maybe i'm gonna see if we can revisit that brother branham say you give them a gift but tell them that we are not worshiping this are you there it is not a law the message come you who are heavy laden i'm gonna give you give me your heavy burden i'm gonna give you mine mine is what light and what easy if you don't understand that it's gonna be heavy when you understand i'm not trying to take the fan off of you i am not putting you in a prison i am not getting everything away from you i am just taking what can harm you what the devil can use to to enter into your life amen worship easter i don't have any problem take the bunnies away christmas it's a guest it's against completely the date is wrong everything is wrong you don't want to join when the devil work with it if you got if you have a time you go read the church edge book you're going to understand many of those stuff when we say hi here we say this we say now i'm not putting you in prison and i'm gonna repeat reverse that lord's willing even probably on wednesday and you're gonna see that those nails are just hidden threat that's why when a woman comes from from assad god say let her trim her there why does she have to trim her nail if her nail was already trimmed why it was a gentle way for women to have long nails and long nails is going to cause you problem with your hygiene go check your cdc you have long nail like this how do you take a shower [Music] go see cdc go check the cdc website it's going to tell you it's hiddenness it's a hiddenness let's pray heavenly father lord we thank you again for your grace for your love and for your mercy father and coming and helping us understanding lord that it's not a matter of the law you cannot come and take us out of the law to bring us back again unto the lord but actually it's a different law which is the law of love and the law of grace lord father that's why even in the book of acts they say do not put any more burden than what they already have but up tell them to abstain from the lifestyle of the gentiles lord we thank you for opening our eyes because these things has been difficult in the mind of the people especially the younger generation they didn't understand why we are telling them not to do certain things but it takes your grace to come and to open this channel to show that it's only a separation from a hidden lifestyle from a pagan an uncircumcised lifestyle where it's human that are given to fornication to banqueting to reveling to all kind of uncleanness to high heels to all this kind of stuff lord father we thank you for lord bringing this knowledge and father bringing your word with such a power to break these bonds of the devil and to help us understand and catch your mind lord we thank you for this service lord and we are committing each one of us this morning until the end may the holy spirit continue to minister and to afford your word to your children as we commit everything unto the hand in jesus precious name amen god bless you church we love you [Music] hallelujah that god should love a sinner such as i should learn to change my sorrow into bliss no rest till he had planned to bring me night how wonderful is love like this such love such wondrous love such onerous love that god should love a sinner such as

think of my [Music] i think of him all the day long i sing for i cannot be silent his love is the theme of my song [Music] redeemed redeemed [Music] that love no longer a servant where is bride amen i want to give a little teeny testimony i'm not gonna hold us long when our son was two i was still in the military we came home here to charlotte i was just in sumter at shaw air force base and we came home at christmas time to visit my mom and even as a two-year-old my plan was to make it a big christmas for my son you know because because of what i remembered as a child so we put a tree up at her house put all his gifts and everybody else's under the at the foot of the tree right and we did our thing it didn't go over like i expected with jeffrey but there was probably a reason so i get back to the base and i don't know if y'all know paul stewart y'all remember paul he and i served together in desert storm and again i claim that as far as i know we're the only two that came out of desert storm with this message so he goes so what'd you do for christmas i said you know i went to my mom's did you put a tree up y'all know how brother paul is did you put the tree up yes we did but i said brother paul we did not worship that tree he said he said uh when the wise man finally reached jesus as a little boy where do you think they put the gold the frankincense in the myrrh i said probably at his feet he said where'd you put them presents i said at the foot of the tree i said i didn't worship that tree paul he said wonder what god thought never put another one up never put another one up i don't want to give the appearance of evil so we gained our revelation of christmas when our son was two all hearts and mind clear there's the baskets back here at the back for the building fun in this message wonderful there was something what was it that struck us on wednesday night that he said we just looked at each other and just went i don't recall what it was i'm sure you wrote it down brother lamont you want to come up and dismiss us this afternoon y'all pray for each other pray for the meeting saturday at my home that everything that leads up to it this week goes well okay and just keep each other in love and in the heart right that's right man our hearts are minor clear dear precious lord we just thank you for talking to us this morning this afternoon lord just thank you for the revelation for the christmas tree so thank you prayer that's close to everybody especially myself most of all my fiancee if she see me online just uh keep us in prayer not to wear the more christmas sweaters so we just thank god for the words just thank god for the revelations thank god for the spiritual songs to hymns and bless us to be on the road safe and traveling any distinction we got to go to and bless us all within the spirit and truth of deed we are shooting all these blessings jesus name that we pray we say amen thank you redeemed redeemed redeemed by the blood of the lamb [Music] his child
