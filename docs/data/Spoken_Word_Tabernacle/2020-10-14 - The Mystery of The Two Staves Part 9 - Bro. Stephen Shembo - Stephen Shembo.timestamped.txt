[0:46] been
[0:46] the last week or two it's just been a
[0:48] really trying week for me
[0:49] it seems like everything in life always
[0:51] seems to hit all at once
[0:53] and it just started with my car the
[0:55] situation in my car and the accident and
[0:57] then
[0:58] just one thing after another and it
[1:01] started to get me discouraged but i just
[1:03] started to think about
[1:04] you know i spent some time in prayer
[1:05] last night just thanking the lord i'm
[1:07] like lord
[1:08] no matter what happens no matter what is
[1:10] or no matter
[1:11] how rough the situation might get i know
[1:14] you're still the same yesterday
[1:15] and forever everything i have is because
[1:18] of you and if everything is taken away
[1:19] from me i'll still praise you
[1:21] nothing satan can attack me all he wants
[1:24] but he's not going to gain a
[1:29] i spent time and god just you know did
[1:32] something for me last night and i was
[1:33] just
[1:34] i came up from my knees i was just so
[1:35] grateful i was like lord forgive me
[1:38] for being discouraged there's no reason
[1:40] for us to be discouraged we know
[1:42] we know the end from the beginning and
[1:44] we know we're predestinated and we know
[1:46] he's got it all in control so no matter
[1:48] how the situation might get just know
[1:52] he's got control and you can rest in
[1:54] that that's why us as believers we can
[1:56] just have
[1:56] peace joy comfort and uh
[2:00] i had a guy from work quit um i know i'm
[2:02] talking about y'all forgive me but
[2:04] i had a guy from work quit just recently
[2:07] at the job
[2:08] and he got on the phone with me and he
[2:10] told me he's like hey i
[2:11] i never told you this while we worked
[2:12] together but i'm going to tell you now
[2:15] and i just say this for the glory of god
[2:16] but just because i was going through a
[2:18] hard time
[2:19] god used this as a comfort but he said
[2:21] i've never in my life met somebody
[2:23] that has been so peaceful so joyful
[2:27] so content so happy he said every day
[2:29] you come into work you have a smile on
[2:31] your face no matter what might go on
[2:33] and he said i just called you and he
[2:35] said he said i called you and i asked
[2:37] you how you were doing and you said you
[2:38] were doing great god is good you're
[2:40] blessed
[2:40] and he's like but i was just told by one
[2:42] of our co-workers that you just totaled
[2:44] your car and you didn't have
[2:45] anything but liability and you were out
[2:47] thousands of dollars but yeah when i
[2:48] called you you said everything was great
[2:50] and i was like well that's just my
[2:52] testimony god's been good to me no
[2:53] matter what happens
[2:55] he's good and that just it stood out to
[2:57] him he's like that's that stood out to
[2:59] me from the second i've worked here
[3:01] until now and he's like and i want you
[3:03] to know that i'll stick with me for the
[3:04] rest of my life
[3:05] and i was just like lord thank you
[3:08] thank you for that that was that was for
[3:10] me just to encourage me that
[3:12] you know how no matter how hard satan
[3:14] might hit no matter how much you might
[3:16] get down
[3:17] you just know that god's got all in
[3:19] control we're blessed we're a blessed
[3:20] people
[3:21] if anything just to be here on sunday
[3:23] and wednesday and hear the word and
[3:24] to see god continuing to move and unveil
[3:27] and reveal his word is just a blessing
[3:30] but we're going to go ahead and start
[3:31] with this song i heard a sister sing it
[3:34] as as we were getting ready and it
[3:36] sounded good and i figured we'd just
[3:37] start with it this morning or this

[40:17] so genesis chapter 38
[40:22] we touch on this before but
[40:25] last sunday we stopped with the
[40:27] sovereignty of god
[40:29] so everybody knows how to break into
[40:31] that sovereignty
[40:33] if you can break into it it's not my
[40:35] fault
[40:37] you have been given the keys to break
[40:39] into the sovereignty of god

[41:01] tomorrow or before church
[41:06] nothing happened by any chance to the
[41:08] believer
[41:09] genesis 38 verse 13 if you dare you can
[41:14] say amen
[41:15] and it was told tamar you know about
[41:18] this now
[41:20] saying behold your father in law goes
[41:23] up not down to timna to share
[41:27] the ship we already spoke about this
[41:30] sharing
[41:30] of the ship you know what it means
[41:33] without shearing
[41:34] you cannot enter into the holy you might
[41:37] be seated
[41:39] verse 14 and she put her widow's garment
[41:41] off
[41:42] from her
[41:45] just like blind bartimaeus and cover her
[41:49] we fever we know what he means should
[41:51] surrender
[41:53] her head amen it's the time
[41:57] of the shearing the shearing of wool
[42:03] and she took off her widow's garment
[42:09] amen she had a head
[42:13] but she coupled that with a veil
[42:17] she veiled her head meaning there is no
[42:21] headship anymore in other words she has
[42:24] surrendered
[42:28] her self-will
[42:32] or her free moral agency
[42:37] amen she has she's not thinking
[42:41] on her own anymore she has a different
[42:44] head
[42:45] if the head said to the right she moved
[42:49] to the right
[42:50] amen it's like when you're trusting gps
[42:53] you don't use your brain if gps say make
[42:56] a right
[42:57] make a right make a left make a left
[43:00] exit
[43:00] exit if you don't want to listen you're
[43:02] going to get lost
[43:04] amen and rob herself and sat in an open
[43:08] place
[43:09] which is by the way to tim now for she
[43:11] saw
[43:12] that sheila was grown and she was not
[43:15] given to him
[43:16] as a wife let's go to the song of
[43:19] solomon
[43:22] in this church we look at everywhere
[43:27] in the bible
[43:30] because the seals has been open we have
[43:33] no restriction
[43:38] amen
[43:40] song of solomon chapter six
[43:45] if you're there you can say amen i hope
[43:48] i'm gonna get where i want it to
[43:52] verse one where is your beloved gone or
[43:55] fairest among women so they are women
[43:59] but this one is the fairest
[44:03] right when they say fairest means she's
[44:07] the top
[44:09] right she's above every other woman
[44:14] where is my beloved gone oh you fairest
[44:18] among women
[44:19] where is your beloved turn aside that we
[44:22] may seek him
[44:23] with you jump to verse eight
[44:26] there are three score in other words 60
[44:29] queens
[44:30] right
[44:34] the first category is a queen
[44:39] we're dealing with feste right
[44:43] there are two score screens and four
[44:46] score
[44:46] in other words eddie concubines that's
[44:49] the second category
[44:56] everybody there and the third category
[45:01] is virgins it is a category for queen
[45:06] queen is a position
[45:09] right amen there are
[45:13] four three score twins and four score
[45:16] concubines and virgins without number
[45:20] so you have those three categories
[45:23] either you're a concubine or you're just
[45:25] a virgin
[45:26] or you're a queen right
[45:30] verse nine my dove
[45:33] my undefined perfect one
[45:37] is but what that's why she's the first
[45:42] so regardless of the numbers of queens
[45:46] regardless of the number of conkey man
[45:48] or virgin

[45:53] you cannot have two
[45:57] my undefiled is that one just like he oh

[46:19] she is the only one of her mother she is
[46:22] the choice one
[46:25] not only is she the only one but
[46:28] she is the choice one
[46:31] the chosen
[46:35] here comes the bride she is the chosen
[46:38] one
[46:39] you know that song sister amen
[46:42] my daughter mahandi phil is about one

[47:00] something special
[47:02] about this lady that when somebody
[47:05] sees her she's always
[47:08] pleasing to people amen there is
[47:11] a kind of grace or favor going on
[47:14] around this lady amen
[47:18] praise the name of the lord let's go to
[47:20] matthew 25.
[47:25] hallelujah we spoke on sunday
[47:29] on the sovereignty of god which is the
[47:33] first key
[47:34] to the third pool right
[47:37] now we're gonna blend from the
[47:39] sovereignty
[47:41] we will find an intersection a
[47:43] preparation to the line of duty
[47:45] that's what we're doing tonight how can
[47:49] you move from there to the line of duty
[47:52] then next sunday we pick up on the line
[47:55] of dude itself
[47:57] amen matthew 25
[48:03] then shall the kingdom of heaven be like
[48:05] and two
[48:06] ten virgins which took their lamp
[48:10] and went forth to meet the bridegroom so
[48:12] they went they all
[48:14] went to meet the bride room if you judge
[48:16] them
[48:17] right there all of them go to heaven
[48:20] just like oprah
[48:21] and roof both of them were on the way to
[48:24] judah
[48:25] but on the midway
[48:28] opera went back right and five of them
[48:32] were wise
[48:33] and five were foolish
[48:38] five of them were wise
[48:42] and five were foolish
[48:45] [Music]
[48:46] if you look at them all of them are
[48:48] virgins
[48:50] all of them look good you got to
[48:53] test their wisdom amen
[48:57] they thou are foolish took their lamps
[49:01] and took no oil with them
[49:04] so their valley was manifested by the
[49:07] lack of oil
[49:10] amen
[49:11] [Music]
[49:14] if you check them everything is good
[49:17] except they own but the wise
[49:20] took all in their vessels with their
[49:23] lamps
[49:24] while the broad groom terry there is a
[49:26] delay
[49:28] they all slumbered and slept
[49:32] and at the midnight there was a cry
[49:35] which means
[49:36] a shout a message
[49:39] so this prophecy really
[49:43] is completely fulfilled in the end time
[49:48] amen made
[49:51] behold the bridegroom cometh because
[49:54] when the church ages started
[49:56] at the beginning with paul there was no
[49:58] marriage
[49:59] paul said i inspired you into christ
[50:02] everybody clear but the marriage take at
[50:05] the
[50:06] end of the church ages that's when the
[50:08] bridegroom cometh
[50:10] that's when we are going to the marriage
[50:12] supper
[50:13] anybody clear so it's applied to the end
[50:16] time
[50:17] then all those virgins arose all of them
[50:21] and trimmed their lamps and the foolish
[50:24] said to the wise givers of your oil
[50:27] for our lamps are gone out
[50:30] at the wrong time but the wise answered
[50:32] saying
[50:33] not so lest there be not enough for us
[50:36] and you
[50:37] but you go rather to them that sell and
[50:39] buy for yourself
[50:40] it's an individual affair and while they
[50:43] went to buy
[50:45] the bridegroom came and there they were
[50:48] ready
[50:49] they were ready bad have made herself
[50:54] you see who was ready so the five that
[50:56] were ready are the bride
[50:59] it's right there in your scripture
[51:05] that's your bread this is still a church
[51:08] but it's not the bride amen
[51:11] praise the name of the lord make herself
[51:13] ready
[51:14] uh that were already went in with her to
[51:17] the
[51:18] marriage and the door was shut
[51:22] closed after all it came
[51:25] all also the other virgin saying lord
[51:29] lord this kind of calling belongs to the
[51:33] gentile
[51:35] son of david lord
[51:39] he opened up lord lord have we not cast
[51:42] devil gentle are we there lord lord
[51:46] open to us but he answered and said
[51:49] verily i said to you
[51:50] i know you not everybody clear
[51:55] praise the name of the lord let's pray
[51:57] it's on wednesday so let's take it
[51:59] 35 miles an hour amen
[52:02] heavenly father lord we thank you again
[52:05] father for your grace you love your
[52:06] mercy and for everything you're doing

[52:11] opportunity
[52:12] to be lord father gather together around
[52:15] the revealed word of the hour
[52:17] in church tonight father we thank you
[52:19] for solving the problem for my brother
[52:21] and we thank you for everything you're
[52:23] doing in each family of this church
[52:26] lord we are committing this service unto
[52:28] the hand
[52:29] father may you move me completely out of
[52:31] the way may you come and speak to your
[52:33] children
[52:33] may your anointing flow freely lord may
[52:36] you remove
[52:37] every demonic spirit lord father may you
[52:40] remember those online that are streaming
[52:42] some of them going to work some of them
[52:44] coming from work and have
[52:46] difficulty but father may you minister
[52:48] to each one of them
[52:49] lord we committed all in the name of
[52:52] jesus christ
[52:53] amen all right god bless you
[52:56] now we last sunday we
[52:59] we were dealing with part eight we
[53:02] already know about the benefits of judah
[53:05] the first one which we already dealt
[53:07] with the barley and the wheat
[53:09] the golden scepter the royal priesthood
[53:11] the signet where we are still dealing
[53:13] with it
[53:14] once we finish the segment then we will
[53:16] go to the bracelet
[53:17] and to the child we already deal with
[53:21] the three pretty much we are still
[53:23] dealing with the fourth one
[53:25] and the last sunday we dealt with the
[53:28] sovereignty of god
[53:30] now today we're gonna get on part nine
[53:32] where
[53:33] we will touch up a little bit on that
[53:35] priesthood
[53:36] to get a transition that's the reason
[53:38] why i had to go back to
[53:40] uh uh tamar everybody clear
[53:44] now when we just read the scripture in
[53:47] matthew 25
[53:49] we found out that the difference between
[53:51] the foolish version
[53:53] and the wise virgin was the oil
[53:56] but all those women were virgins
[54:00] everybody clear brother branham helped
[54:03] me
[54:03] in the 10 virgins and 144
[54:08] 000. brother brandon preached a message
[54:11] and he tagged that message the 10th
[54:14] virgin
[54:16] everybody clear and the 144
[54:21] 000 within among those virgins
[54:26] five of them are wise
[54:29] which makes the bride and five of them
[54:33] are foolish everybody clear
[54:37] so this message speaks about three
[54:39] categories
[54:40] of people it's talking about the bride
[54:43] gentile everybody clear
[54:47] that goes into the rapture it's talking
[54:50] about the nominal church
[54:52] gentile that misses the rupture
[54:56] and goes into tribulation
[55:00] everybody clear and he spoke also about
[55:03] the 144 000
[55:06] which are dealt with in the tribulation
[55:09] period
[55:11] everybody clear now brother bonham say
[55:16] so the greek word for clean is
[55:18] sanctified
[55:20] the hebrew word is holy holy
[55:24] clean and sanctified is all the same
[55:27] word
[55:28] so this was not filthy dirty church
[55:32] they're a virgin it was a sanctified
[55:36] clean church tenth virgin went out to
[55:39] meet the bridegroom
[55:41] what does it mean all these
[55:44] churches not down here in the roman
[55:48] but down into the denominational
[55:51] the nicolaitan baptists
[55:54] preach on the second coming of christ
[55:57] amen
[55:59] we preach on the second coming of christ
[56:03] so no difference right
[56:06] methodists preach the second coming of
[56:08] christ
[56:10] presbyterian preached the second coming
[56:12] of christ
[56:13] virgins nazarene preached
[56:16] the second coming of christ virgins
[56:19] pilgrim
[56:20] holiness preached the second coming of
[56:22] christ
[56:23] virgin that's right all of them
[56:27] even the message believer preached the
[56:29] second coming of jesus christ
[56:32] virgin all of us all of them
[56:35] went out to meet the bridegroom now you
[56:38] remember
[56:39] that that day everyone was on the road
[56:43] to meet the bridegroom just like ruth
[56:46] and oppa
[56:47] everybody clear now if god only respects
[56:50] that if you stop writing
[56:53] and you look at everybody then he have
[56:57] to take them too but for some reason the
[57:00] choice of god
[57:01] never started by the fact that they were
[57:04] engaged
[57:06] into the road to meet the bridegroom
[57:09] being engaged into the message doesn't
[57:13] get you
[57:14] somewhere because we were many engaged
[57:17] into the message
[57:18] today some that we started with are no
[57:22] longer
[57:22] in the message are you there praise the
[57:26] name of the lord
[57:27] brother branham continues in the same
[57:29] message he said now
[57:31] there was the virgin there was the
[57:34] virgin went on to meet him
[57:36] and the foolish virgin now did not have
[57:39] oil
[57:39] in their lamp but they had everything
[57:43] else are you there so by the scripture
[57:47] and by brother branham line up together
[57:50] brother branham didn't give you the
[57:52] scripture but you look at the scripture
[57:54] line up everybody clear so the
[57:57] difference between
[57:59] this virgin and that virgin is only the
[58:02] oil
[58:03] but everything else they got it
[58:06] everybody clear
[58:08] they were clean they believe in christ
[58:11] that's why when you say let's preach
[58:13] christ let's believe in christ it's not
[58:15] enough
[58:17] anybody care they believe christ
[58:20] they preach the word that they believe
[58:23] everybody clear the portion of christ
[58:26] they have
[58:27] their denomination would let them preach
[58:31] they preach that the second coming the
[58:34] sacrifice
[58:35] the atonement they believe you ever tied
[58:39] up with a good
[58:40] baptist scholar one time everybody there
[58:44] you better know what you're talking
[58:46] about
[58:48] in other words there are people outside
[58:50] of the message
[58:52] that know how to handle the bible
[58:55] so you as a message believer you should
[58:58] be able to handle the bible more than
[59:00] them
[59:02] are you there so you're gonna find that
[59:05] jehovah witness you need to know your
[59:07] bible pretty good
[59:08] before they make your head spin and you
[59:11] come back and ask the pastor
[59:14] everybody here but you see so close
[59:20] say matthew 24 matthew 24 24
[59:23] read it right away and you shall see
[59:26] jesus said that in this last day
[59:28] the two spirits you see now
[59:32] will be so close till
[59:35] it will deceive the very elected if it
[59:38] was
[59:39] possible it shall be so close
[59:42] it shall swing them pentecostal like
[59:45] nobody's business sure everybody clear
[59:50] no problem but branham continues he said
[59:53] now watch the
[59:55] there is one church that is called the
[59:57] bride
[59:59] clear and there is another one that is
[1:00:02] called the
[1:00:03] nominal church which is the foolish
[1:00:06] virgin everybody clear now watch these
[1:00:09] two churches
[1:00:11] if there was some way i could just make
[1:00:13] the people see it
[1:00:14] just burns in my soul these churches
[1:00:18] are just as clean and holy as this one
[1:00:22] virgin if they are all virgins
[1:00:26] they are all virgins just as clean the
[1:00:29] only difference
[1:00:30] was the oil in the lamp the
[1:00:34] holy ghost and the holy ghost
[1:00:37] if it's not there if it's in there
[1:00:40] it the very same kind of fire
[1:00:44] he did on pentecost because it's the
[1:00:47] same
[1:00:48] spirit jesus christ the same yesterday
[1:00:51] today and
[1:00:52] forever amen but they don't have no fire
[1:00:57] you go to a baptist church quiet
[1:01:00] are you there and some of the message
[1:01:03] churches also
[1:01:04] quiet like baptists
[1:01:09] no fire no oil in their lamp
[1:01:13] they have church ritual going to church
[1:01:16] as a custom
[1:01:18] church just as ritual
[1:01:21] farm ceremony nothing against it
[1:01:24] creed that would check your conscience
[1:01:27] so you find that joel
[1:01:28] austin he can talk to you in a
[1:01:31] philosophical way
[1:01:33] until it makes sense
[1:01:36] are you there and songs like
[1:01:39] angel singing amen
[1:01:43] they make miracles wonderful songs
[1:01:47] amen but they are not deprived
[1:01:52] amen songs like
[1:01:55] angels you put your finger
[1:01:58] on their life you could not do it but
[1:02:02] still that is wrong
[1:02:07] it's part of it but not all of it
[1:02:11] that is the gun that misses the
[1:02:14] rapture amen
[1:02:18] the singing the anointing comes they
[1:02:20] think they want to go to the ratchet
[1:02:22] that's the khan that misses the rapture
[1:02:26] brother branham what's going on now
[1:02:29] while
[1:02:30] she was gone to get some oil that is
[1:02:33] what they are trying to do right now
[1:02:35] these great evangelical churches
[1:02:38] trying to find these great things you
[1:02:39] know go back to the
[1:02:42] let's go back to the bible let's go back
[1:02:44] to the bible let's go back to the bible
[1:02:46] because they figured out as a long time
[1:02:49] it seems like we are missing something
[1:02:54] are you there we need the pentecostal
[1:02:57] blessing why
[1:02:59] you missing something
[1:03:02] why you can imagine what kind of service
[1:03:05] they are going to have
[1:03:07] they are going to get down there and
[1:03:10] spoil
[1:03:11] all damn manukau on them
[1:03:14] we okay now amen they can preach the
[1:03:17] second coming
[1:03:18] they can preach the atonement they can
[1:03:21] preach the sacrifice
[1:03:22] but they will never touch up and tell
[1:03:25] women
[1:03:26] stop wearing pants because if they do
[1:03:30] that they're gonna lose church member
[1:03:33] they cannot tell the women stop wearing

[1:03:45] lipstick
[1:03:46] if they do that they're going to warn
[1:03:49] the
[1:03:49] ministry are you there but they want to
[1:03:53] focus on the preaching
[1:03:54] but don't want to touch the very
[1:03:57] important part
[1:03:59] they don't want to deal with the world
[1:04:05] amen amen
[1:04:08] once an opportunity comes are you there

[1:04:57] give up their sororities
[1:04:59] and societies and things like that
[1:05:03] holding onto the world like esau
[1:05:07] following me in one hand
[1:05:10] trying to catch god with the other hand
[1:05:14] in other words they want the blessings
[1:05:17] of god
[1:05:18] they want the miracle of god they want
[1:05:21] the power of god
[1:05:22] but they don't want to let things go
[1:05:26] are you there that's why a preacher
[1:05:29] taught brother branham
[1:05:30] why are you always calling on women
[1:05:33] why are you always cheaping the world
[1:05:37] give them the great supernatural
[1:05:39] blessing
[1:05:40] and brother one of them said if they
[1:05:42] don't understand their abcs

[1:05:52] keep the world keep wearing paint keep
[1:05:55] wearing tight pants
[1:05:57] keep wearing and clean clothes keep
[1:05:59] doing whatever they do normally
[1:06:02] and still yet get blessed
[1:06:06] anybody there holding on to the word
[1:06:08] like eso in one hand
[1:06:10] trying to catch god with the other hand
[1:06:13] you can do that
[1:06:15] you can be a cross-tied christian
[1:06:18] you know looking at god and to the world
[1:06:21] too
[1:06:22] you got to center yourself in calvary
[1:06:26] stay right there with that that is your
[1:06:30] characteristic
[1:06:31] of the foolish virgin
[1:06:34] are we there in matthew
[1:06:38] 25 we saw that there is a broad
[1:06:41] and there is a foolish virgin everybody
[1:06:43] clear
[1:06:44] now brother what i'm saying in the
[1:06:46] message the rapture he said the first
[1:06:48] things cometh
[1:06:49] when he start descending from heaven
[1:06:51] there is uh
[1:06:52] a shout a midnight cry
[1:06:56] what is it is a message to get the
[1:06:59] people
[1:07:00] together it is gathering the people
[1:07:03] it is gathering the virgin it is
[1:07:06] gathering
[1:07:07] the people a message comes forth first
[1:07:11] now lamp what trimming time
[1:07:14] rise and trim your lamps what
[1:07:17] was what watch was that the seventh
[1:07:21] not the six the seven behold the
[1:07:24] bridegroom cometh
[1:07:25] rise and trim your lamp and they did
[1:07:28] some of them found they didn't have
[1:07:30] all have any oil in their lamp see
[1:07:34] but it's lamp trimming time it is what
[1:07:38] malachi 4 time what he
[1:07:42] promises luke 17 you know what he means
[1:07:45] 30.
[1:07:46] all does prophecy that he can be
[1:07:49] perfectly said in order for today for
[1:07:51] this day
[1:07:52] in the scripture we see it living right
[1:07:55] there so the prophecy of matthew 24
[1:07:58] matthew 25 of the 10th version fully
[1:08:02] is accomplished in the same time
[1:08:05] everybody clear now the second person i
[1:08:09] want to touch then we jump to esther
[1:08:11] is the roman centurion let's take
[1:08:15] matthew
[1:08:15] chapter 18. you were on 25 so let's go
[1:08:19] back to chapter eight if you're there
[1:08:22] you can say amen
[1:08:28] matthew 8 verse 8 if you dare you can
[1:08:31] say amen
[1:08:33] this centurion and gentile
[1:08:37] answer and say lord i'm not worthy
[1:08:40] humility that you should come under my
[1:08:43] roof i'm a gentile
[1:08:44] i'm like roof right now ready that you
[1:08:48] come in under my roof
[1:08:50] but speak the word which is the gentile
[1:08:52] only
[1:08:53] and my servant shall be healed for i am
[1:08:56] a man
[1:08:56] under what you see the power
[1:08:59] of the spoken word is connected with
[1:09:02] authority
[1:09:03] you remember monica you remember
[1:09:07] the adoption authority and the power of
[1:09:09] the spoken word
[1:09:11] for i am a man under authority
[1:09:14] having soldier under me and i said to
[1:09:16] this one go
[1:09:17] and he goes and to another come and he
[1:09:20] cometh and to my servant duties
[1:09:22] and he does it when jesus heard it
[1:09:26] he marveled and said to them that
[1:09:28] followed him
[1:09:29] verily i say to you i have not found so
[1:09:32] great faith no
[1:09:34] not in israel in other words that great
[1:09:38] faith of the power of the spoken word
[1:09:43] and the authority is given
[1:09:46] to the gentile everybody clear
[1:09:49] but it is not given to the gentile the
[1:09:52] foolish virgin
[1:09:56] we okay because power with our character
[1:10:00] is satanic everybody clear
[1:10:03] verse 11 and i say to you that
[1:10:06] many shall come from the east and west
[1:10:10] and shall sit with who abraham and isaac
[1:10:14] and jacob in the kingdom of what
[1:10:20] but the children of the
[1:10:23] the jews everybody clear
[1:10:27] many shall come from east from west
[1:10:30] they shall sit with what abraham the
[1:10:33] gentile
[1:10:34] will be invited into the commonwealth of
[1:10:38] israel but the jews themselves
[1:10:41] will be cast out you understand now
[1:10:46] but the children of the kingdom shall be
[1:10:49] cast out
[1:10:49] into other god darkness there shall be
[1:10:53] what
[1:10:54] whipping and gnashing of teeth whipping
[1:10:56] and washing of thief
[1:10:58] spoke about the tribulation period
[1:11:01] so there will be jews that will go under
[1:11:04] the tribulation period and the jews that
[1:11:07] goes under the tribulation period are
[1:11:09] the
[1:11:10] 140 000. so by matthew 8
[1:11:15] by matthew 25 we understand that
[1:11:18] the gentile brad is made of
[1:11:22] virgins that have oil and by matthew
[1:11:26] chapter 8 we understand that that brad
[1:11:29] will have the power of the spoken
[1:11:32] word and the authority of god
[1:11:36] and that blood is going to be gentile
[1:11:38] everybody clear
[1:11:40] so right here we have the bride and the
[1:11:42] foolish virgin
[1:11:44] right here we have the bride the gentile
[1:11:47] with the authority
[1:11:48] and the jews the 144 thousand
[1:11:52] going through the tribulation period
[1:11:54] everybody clear
[1:11:56] brother branham can you put these two
[1:11:58] together for me
[1:12:00] brother brahm was asked a question the
[1:12:02] second question
[1:12:03] but the children of the kingdom shall be
[1:12:05] casting out of darkness
[1:12:07] is that about the same as casting them
[1:12:10] out of the mind of god
[1:12:12] but branham answered the question
[1:12:13] paragraph 34 no
[1:12:15] it would not be the same you are
[1:12:17] referring here to the wedding supper
[1:12:20] and the children of the kingdom as we
[1:12:22] ask here
[1:12:23] the children of the kingdom are what
[1:12:26] the jews and they were cuts into other
[1:12:30] darkness on the job there they were cast
[1:12:33] into other darkness
[1:12:35] because it will give you an eye gentle
[1:12:38] experience to repent but they will never
[1:12:41] cast out of the mind of god
[1:12:43] he shall never forget israel that's your
[1:12:46] roman chapter 11.
[1:12:48] see it's the kingdom the promise in
[1:12:51] other words
[1:12:52] god dealing with the nation when he
[1:12:54] dealt with israel
[1:12:56] which is the children of the kingdom
[1:12:59] brother branham you remember he said
[1:13:02] here
[1:13:03] and abraham and isaac and jacob in one
[1:13:05] place
[1:13:06] would come and set in the kingdom and
[1:13:08] what
[1:13:09] the end time see abraham isaac and jacob
[1:13:13] will be in the kingdom they were they
[1:13:16] were the kingdoms
[1:13:18] blessing people when the bridegroom
[1:13:21] cometh
[1:13:22] five watch how brother branham is
[1:13:24] blaming those scriptures
[1:13:25] matthew 8 and matthew 25. everybody
[1:13:28] clear
[1:13:29] when the bridegroom comes five of the
[1:13:32] virgins went out to meet the lord
[1:13:34] and they didn't have any or they didn't
[1:13:37] take any oil in their lamp
[1:13:39] and the other five took oil in their
[1:13:41] lamp now if you notice
[1:13:44] it's a beautiful picture buff off there
[1:13:47] and uh as they did what
[1:13:51] ever clear the reason why the jews are
[1:13:55] going
[1:13:55] under the tribulation period because
[1:13:57] they rejected jesus christ
[1:14:00] are you there and the reason why the
[1:14:02] foolish virgin is going to the
[1:14:04] tribulation period
[1:14:05] because she rejected jesus christ not
[1:14:09] jesus christ in the first coming
[1:14:11] but jesus christ in the second coming
[1:14:17] keep in mind that there is three classes
[1:14:20] of people
[1:14:20] all the time jews gentile and the
[1:14:24] church if you get those mixed up you
[1:14:27] shall surely run in trouble when you hit
[1:14:30] them in other words when you begin to
[1:14:33] read the book of revelation
[1:14:34] keep in mind jews gentile and the
[1:14:38] church because within the church there
[1:14:41] is a true vine
[1:14:42] and the false vlan are you there the
[1:14:44] first vine is the foolish virgin
[1:14:46] and the true vine is the bread everybody
[1:14:49] clear
[1:14:50] all right brother branham now when we
[1:14:52] talk about
[1:14:53] the priesthood of judah we found out in
[1:14:56] ezekiel 44 verse 15
[1:14:59] that a high priest could not enter into
[1:15:02] the holy unfoly
[1:15:04] with war everybody remember that praise
[1:15:06] the name of the lord
[1:15:07] he needs to be sheared now they don't
[1:15:10] want to
[1:15:11] wall in the holy place if you watch
[1:15:16] according to genesis a
[1:15:20] ship have to be sheared first everybody
[1:15:23] clear
[1:15:24] but before you enter the holy of holi
[1:15:28] the only garment that was permitted
[1:15:31] was the clothing of fine lemon
[1:15:34] you remember that read the scripture at
[1:15:37] home
[1:15:38] if you forgot about it and finally it
[1:15:40] was the what
[1:15:42] the righteousness of the in other words
[1:15:45] you cannot
[1:15:46] approach the lord without the scepter
[1:15:51] without the righteousness of christ
[1:15:54] are you there you need to be clothed in
[1:15:57] his righteousness
[1:15:59] then we have boldness to enter into the
[1:16:02] holy of holies
[1:16:04] and then we can bring our petition but
[1:16:07] your woe
[1:16:08] must be sheared off then you are clothed
[1:16:12] with the righteousness of god
[1:16:14] and then you can enter the holy of holy
[1:16:16] everybody clear
[1:16:18] praise the name of the lord now we have
[1:16:21] here the foolish virgin
[1:16:23] and the hundred and forty four thousand
[1:16:25] both of those goes to the tribulation
[1:16:27] period
[1:16:28] brother branham the gentile blood is in
[1:16:30] heaven
[1:16:31] and the sleeping virgin the gentile
[1:16:34] virgin
[1:16:34] is not to be saved during that time
[1:16:36] she's already been saved
[1:16:38] but she has rejected she has been
[1:16:40] rejected in the
[1:16:42] she's the foolish virgin she was called
[1:16:45] to be the bride
[1:16:46] without oil she was rejected
[1:16:50] everybody clear no problem and now she
[1:16:53] only goes through the tribulation period
[1:16:55] of time
[1:16:56] of what purification because she
[1:17:00] rejected
[1:17:01] crust the word for her purification
[1:17:05] then she has to suffer for her deeds
[1:17:08] but the bride who has become the word
[1:17:12] a complete atonement was made of crust
[1:17:15] because he is the word
[1:17:18] brother branham here will the foolish
[1:17:21] virgin be saved
[1:17:22] no we are talking about in the
[1:17:25] tribulation period
[1:17:26] whatever happened is now in other words
[1:17:29] they are safe
[1:17:30] now but they're going to go through the
[1:17:32] tribulation period
[1:17:33] to be purged everybody clear
[1:17:36] after that time now she will have to go
[1:17:40] through the tribulation period
[1:17:42] and the reason of it is is because she
[1:17:44] has rejected the atonement
[1:17:47] in its what she has rejected the message
[1:17:50] of the hour
[1:17:52] are you there she is a believer a
[1:17:56] professed believer
[1:17:57] but she will have to go through the
[1:17:59] tribulation
[1:18:00] period the bible says and the rest of
[1:18:03] them
[1:18:03] the dragon spurt that water out of his
[1:18:06] mouth to make what
[1:18:07] woe to the remnant of the woman
[1:18:10] everybody clear so
[1:18:12] the foolish virgin here are going
[1:18:15] in the tribulation period because there
[1:18:17] is a
[1:18:18] second crucifixion of jesus christ
[1:18:21] your second staff the jews are going to
[1:18:25] the tribulation
[1:18:26] period because there was a rejection of
[1:18:28] jesus christ
[1:18:29] your first staff we clear now
[1:18:32] where are you taking me brother stephen
[1:18:35] take esther now

[1:18:58] that when esther came the second time
[1:19:01] and was crying
[1:19:02] the king of hazares stretched the
[1:19:05] scepter the second time everybody knows
[1:19:06] what it means now
[1:19:08] right then she opened up on first five
[1:19:12] of the four keys of the third pool the
[1:19:15] sovereignty of god
[1:19:16] the line of duty the motive and
[1:19:19] objective
[1:19:20] and faith to say the right thing
[1:19:23] on last sunday we spoke about the
[1:19:25] sovereignty of god
[1:19:27] and we're gonna move from there and
[1:19:29] start blending into the line of
[1:19:31] duty right let's go
[1:19:34] to esther chapter two i'm saving time
[1:19:38] you know the scripture

[1:20:40] her position it's a bad position
[1:20:44] her position to another that is what
[1:20:48] so the next queen that is coming up
[1:20:53] must be higher than the first one
[1:20:56] you follow me she must be higher than
[1:21:00] the queen

[1:21:59] for the king and let who
[1:22:02] the king appoint what
[1:22:06] those officers cannot go by themself
[1:22:11] they must be appointed by the king
[1:22:15] that's why ephesians one one colossian
[1:22:19] one one
[1:22:20] paul an apostle by the will of god
[1:22:25] not man are you there

[1:28:11] you awake i told you 35 miles per hour
[1:28:16] hallelujah brother branham
[1:28:21] we believe in justification by faith
[1:28:25] romans 5 we believe that after a person
[1:28:28] being justified by faith
[1:28:30] he has peace with the lord jesus christ
[1:28:32] but
[1:28:33] it's possible that this same person
[1:28:36] could have habits such as drinking
[1:28:40] smoking doing things that he should not
[1:28:42] do
[1:28:43] filthy habits of the flesh
[1:28:47] i'm gonna say this with respect
[1:28:51] brother branham always taught three
[1:28:54] steps of grace
[1:28:57] justification sanctification baptism of
[1:29:00] the holy ghost
[1:29:02] because this thing these three steps
[1:29:05] were
[1:29:07] taught wrong express wrong
[1:29:10] that's why we have problem in the
[1:29:12] message
[1:29:14] are you there someone preached
[1:29:18] on this church that when you receive the
[1:29:20] message you receive all three
[1:29:24] he was preachy we didn't have a pastor
[1:29:29] i could not correct it but now
[1:29:32] that i'm a pastor we gotta correct that
[1:29:35] one
[1:29:36] are you there you got to go through
[1:29:40] justification sanctification
[1:29:43] baptism of the holy ghost because
[1:29:47] when we were five a year ago
[1:29:50] we were with people that we thought
[1:29:53] believed the message
[1:29:56] we gave them justification we gave them
[1:30:00] sanctification
[1:30:02] we gave them the holy ghost we even look
[1:30:05] at some of them
[1:30:06] as being more spiritual than us you look
[1:30:10] at the sister you say
[1:30:11] that sister i wish i can be like that
[1:30:13] sister i wish i can be like that brother
[1:30:16] you didn't know what was in the sister
[1:30:19] until the trial comes when the trial
[1:30:23] comes
[1:30:24] the sister that you use unless you as an
[1:30:26] example
[1:30:27] now is wearing makeup now he's wearing
[1:30:30] short dress
[1:30:31] now he's cutting her hair and you are
[1:30:33] still in the message
[1:30:35] question who have the holy ghost
[1:30:43] who was justified you owned them
[1:30:47] you touch they have
[1:30:50] the holy ghost but you come to find out
[1:30:53] you are still in the message
[1:30:54] it is not you doing that it is god in
[1:30:57] your life
[1:31:02] are you there you want the holy ghost to
[1:31:04] be like
[1:31:05] sister soy so today that sister left the
[1:31:08] message
[1:31:11] you want your holy ghost to do that
[1:31:17] you see now you are killing yourself for
[1:31:20] nothing
[1:31:22] using your harmony all the time on
[1:31:24] yourself
[1:31:25] why i can't do this why yes you cannot
[1:31:28] do that
[1:31:29] you just need to put your car on your
[1:31:32] chair
[1:31:37] are you there filthy habits of the flesh
[1:31:42] then we believe that the blood of jesus
[1:31:44] christ sanctifies this person
[1:31:46] for the service of the lord that is we
[1:31:49] believe it's sanctification
[1:31:51] second according to hebrew 13
[1:31:54] 12 where jesus also that he must
[1:31:57] sanctify
[1:31:58] the people with his own blood suffer
[1:32:00] without the great
[1:32:01] and we believe that sanctification is
[1:32:03] taught in the new testament
[1:32:05] and meant for the believer through the
[1:32:07] new testament age
[1:32:08] which we are
[1:32:12] so it is still valid
[1:32:16] we also believe that after the person
[1:32:18] has been sanctified
[1:32:20] the unclean habit has gone from the
[1:32:22] person he is a believer
[1:32:24] on the lord jesus christ and his habits
[1:32:27] are gone
[1:32:28] we believe that then he is a candidate
[1:32:30] for what
[1:32:33] which comes as a feeling of death
[1:32:36] so you must know where you are
[1:32:39] whether you are right here whether you
[1:32:41] are sanctified
[1:32:43] or whether you have the holy ghost we
[1:32:46] gave everybody the holy ghost he is in
[1:32:47] the message he got the holy ghost
[1:32:50] it's just as many time as i have told
[1:32:53] him
[1:32:54] like picking up er out in a chicken yard
[1:32:58] picking up a virgin
[1:33:02] we okay now we're back in our sermon
[1:33:05] justification is what picking up
[1:33:09] ready to use it so when they called the
[1:33:12] virgin
[1:33:13] and they pulled them to the palace they
[1:33:16] were justified
[1:33:18] by calling by being picked up you follow
[1:33:22] me
[1:33:23] praise the name of the lord that with a
[1:33:26] purpose in the heart that's what god
[1:33:28] does to the sinner
[1:33:29] he's still faithful then he is cleansed
[1:33:33] by the blood of what
[1:33:38] let's go to esther 2 chapter 3.
[1:33:43] are you there and let the king appoint
[1:33:47] officer
[1:33:48] in all provinces of his kingdom that
[1:33:50] they may gather together all the fair
[1:33:52] young virgin
[1:33:54] to shushan the palace to the house of
[1:33:56] the women
[1:33:57] to the custody of hege the king's
[1:34:00] chamberlain
[1:34:01] keeper of the women hege keeps the women
[1:34:04] the virgins
[1:34:05] are you there but shaskars
[1:34:09] the one that lost to be picked up
[1:34:12] and let their things for what
[1:34:17] b so the things for purification
[1:34:21] are given by hegemony
[1:34:26] everybody care when you are picked up
[1:34:31] you are justified you enter
[1:34:34] unto the custody of hagee
[1:34:38] you're following me then hege
[1:34:41] will provide you with the stuff for
[1:34:44] sanctification
[1:34:47] you follow me
[1:34:50] oh my god
[1:34:55] we believe okay
[1:34:58] then he is cleansed by the blood of
[1:34:59] jesus christ and the word sanctify is a
[1:35:02] compound word
[1:35:03] which means clean and set aside for what
[1:35:07] they are cleaning the virgin for they
[1:35:10] were cleaning them for
[1:35:12] service they needed to be at a position
[1:35:17] but if you miss that position
[1:35:20] you are conquerable
[1:35:23] roof serving are you there
[1:35:27] we believe that the holy spirit is
[1:35:29] putting the same vessel in service
[1:35:32] that the holy spirit is not another step
[1:35:36] of grace
[1:35:37] but more of the same grace that
[1:35:40] fills the believer to the extent where
[1:35:43] that science
[1:35:44] and wonder such as apostolic gifts
[1:35:47] spoken in first corinthians 12
[1:35:49] manifest themselves through this
[1:35:51] believer when the holy spirit
[1:35:53] comes in to take up the gift you are
[1:35:57] justified
[1:35:58] by the holy spirit and that same holy
[1:36:01] spirit sanctifies you
[1:36:03] and that same holy spirit fill you
[1:36:06] to activate the gift that god blessed
[1:36:10] in your life by predestination
[1:36:14] for the service of the king
[1:36:18] are we clear brother branham
[1:36:22] notice how god makes a plan to us
[1:36:26] when i see this and see that since ah
[1:36:29] boy this is in 1964 after
[1:36:32] the opening of the seals because he was
[1:36:35] so he was told here that
[1:36:37] when the seal opened you received the
[1:36:39] message you receive victory
[1:36:41] brother branham after the sales if you
[1:36:44] need more coach you see me
[1:36:46] since that see that since a boy
[1:36:49] first time ever crossed there with me i
[1:36:52] have still
[1:36:53] always taught those three stages of what
[1:36:57] notice if it's not true brother branham
[1:37:00] never change it
[1:37:01] so if someone say that once you get in
[1:37:03] the message you are justified sanctify
[1:37:05] fear with the holy spirit
[1:37:06] that's not right because he was spoken
[1:37:10] that after this year this is after the
[1:37:12] seal
[1:37:13] 65. when
[1:37:16] i first started preaching many years ago
[1:37:18] we was living right up here on the road
[1:37:21] right just above here i was preaching
[1:37:23] right here at this church
[1:37:24] and she dreamed a dream that i was
[1:37:26] standing here by the side of what
[1:37:30] tristan somebody a sister
[1:37:33] saw a dream brother brandon was standing
[1:37:35] and they were three steps by brother
[1:37:36] brown
[1:37:37] everybody clear and i was standing there
[1:37:40] preaching to everybody
[1:37:41] that they must walk up these three steps
[1:37:45] before they hit there
[1:37:47] and on the highway is a little pearly
[1:37:50] like
[1:37:50] white line run into the doors of heaven
[1:37:54] to the pearly gate and that pearl has
[1:37:57] been stretched out to the top of this
[1:37:59] step in other words one two three step
[1:38:02] down the highway
[1:38:03] all the way to heaven brother branham
[1:38:05] was preaching and telling people
[1:38:07] you must go through this three step to
[1:38:10] get on the highway to
[1:38:11] heaven this is in 65 he never changes
[1:38:15] you need to be justified sanctified fill
[1:38:18] with the holy spirit
[1:38:19] they might happen in stages or they can
[1:38:22] all happen at the same time
[1:38:24] if your heart is right are you there
[1:38:28] okay
[1:38:32] my message exactly today
[1:38:35] what are the three steps
[1:38:38] justification sanctification
[1:38:42] and i was saying that a person has to
[1:38:45] come by these
[1:38:46] three steps to be able to work on that
[1:38:50] so you need to be justified sanctify
[1:38:54] then fill with the holy spirit so when
[1:38:57] you are picked
[1:38:58] up as a virgin you are picked up
[1:39:01] by justification then when you
[1:39:04] enter under the custody of hege
[1:39:08] hege gives you the step for purification
[1:39:11] your sanctification but you are not fair
[1:39:14] yet

[1:39:22] you there the word
[1:39:25] hege have four meanings
[1:39:30] hegem means meditation
[1:39:34] that's the meditation of my mind
[1:39:37] are you there hegem means the word

[1:39:46] and hager means separation

[1:40:27] and he will be the theme of your
[1:40:29] meditation
[1:40:31] preparing you to go into the
[1:40:34] king chamber you okay
[1:40:38] if you miss the king chamber
[1:40:42] you're going to chess gaza
[1:40:50] let's jump to verse 8. then we're going
[1:40:52] to read this
[1:40:54] and it come to pass everybody there
[1:40:57] we won't be too long when the king's
[1:41:00] commandment and decree was heard
[1:41:03] and when many maidens were guarded
[1:41:05] together to shush on
[1:41:09] the palace to the custody of who
[1:41:12] hege that esther was brought also
[1:41:16] justification to the king's house
[1:41:20] to the custody of hege keeper of the
[1:41:22] women he's the one overseeing the church
[1:41:25] the churches the holy spirit he's there
[1:41:28] overseeing the churches
[1:41:30] that's the one that is watching over the
[1:41:32] women are you there
[1:41:34] and the men and please him
[1:41:37] there was something about esther
[1:41:41] that when he saw esther esther
[1:41:44] automatically please him
[1:41:48] the line of duty are you there
[1:41:51] the sovereignty to the line of duty
[1:41:54] and she obtained what kindness
[1:41:57] of him and he speedily
[1:42:01] gave her the things for her purification
[1:42:04] for your sanctification the material
[1:42:08] with such things as belong to
[1:42:11] her and what
[1:42:17] when esther was picked all the virgins
[1:42:21] were picked
[1:42:22] remember there is a lot of virgin but
[1:42:24] only one
[1:42:25] will be the queen there is five ten
[1:42:28] virgin
[1:42:28] only five will be the blood are you
[1:42:31] there
[1:42:32] when the virgins comes all of them were
[1:42:35] good
[1:42:36] pure fine fair lady beautiful
[1:42:39] are you there but one esther came in
[1:42:43] something about peggy and esther click
[1:42:48] are you there angela was pleased
[1:42:52] about esther he gave esther
[1:42:55] her stop for the purification and he
[1:42:58] gave
[1:42:58] also esther seven women
[1:43:02] to work with her i'm reading the bible
[1:43:06] are you there so when you see esther
[1:43:11] the purification of esther have to go
[1:43:15] through seven women
[1:43:21] okay you okay the purification of esther
[1:43:26] must go through seven churches
[1:43:32] okay the bride goes through ephesus
[1:43:36] smyrna titania seventh church
[1:43:39] all those seven steps seven women
[1:43:43] are part of the
[1:43:48] the seven church ages which are
[1:43:50] addressed by john
[1:43:51] are you mano are all gentle churches
[1:43:56] thus the whole of the church ages is god
[1:43:59] dealing with the
[1:44:00] gender and calling out their gentle
[1:44:03] blood to himself
[1:44:04] that makes the changes and the fullness
[1:44:07] of the
[1:44:08] gentile the one and the same thing but
[1:44:11] one of them the seven church changes are
[1:44:13] set forth in revelation chapter two and
[1:44:15] three
[1:44:16] taking the whole spin of the fullness of
[1:44:19] the gentile
[1:44:20] or the whole time in which god is
[1:44:23] dealing with the
[1:44:24] gentile unto salvation so when esther
[1:44:28] gather unto heggie the holy spirit
[1:44:31] open up seven women seven
[1:44:34] church ages that esther have to go
[1:44:37] through
[1:44:39] for her purification esther was giving
[1:44:42] seven women she had to go through seven
[1:44:45] church agents for her
[1:44:47] purification you okay
[1:44:54] let's go for her purification verse nine
[1:44:58] with such things as belonged to her and
[1:45:00] seven maidens seven church ages
[1:45:03] which were meant to be given to her she
[1:45:05] must go through those seven church
[1:45:06] engines
[1:45:07] out of the king's house it was the
[1:45:09] church established by the king
[1:45:12] before smyrna seven of them established
[1:45:15] by
[1:45:16] the king everybody there and he
[1:45:18] preferred her
[1:45:19] and her men stood what
[1:45:23] is somebody sleeping to the best place
[1:45:25] of the house off there
[1:45:27] so not every church is the same
[1:45:33] are you there the virgins were in the
[1:45:36] church
[1:45:37] but within that church there was the
[1:45:40] best place

[1:45:45] we are not the same are we there
[1:45:49] you there drop down to verse 12.
[1:45:54] now when every man every meds turn

[1:47:21] a smell women put perfume on themselves
[1:47:25] for a pleasant
[1:47:26] and men put after shaving stuff on
[1:47:29] sometime like that
[1:47:31] that all the foul orders will be taken
[1:47:34] away from you
[1:47:36] when you walk into the presence of
[1:47:38] someone
[1:47:39] with body odors or with something
[1:47:42] another
[1:47:43] perfume is to take that order away
[1:47:46] so that you in the presence of the
[1:47:49] person
[1:47:50] that you might not be found it's
[1:47:52] unbearable
[1:47:55] that is what perfume or soap has ordered
[1:47:58] in it sweet orders we okay

[1:48:06] he was the rose of sheriff he was
[1:48:09] offered to god

[2:04:42] into the tribulation period
[2:04:46] as a foolish virgin and there
[2:04:50] hager
[2:04:59] will press your face your wool and chest
[2:05:02] gas
[2:05:02] will shield your wall for you because
[2:05:06] you enter into the king chamber with
[2:05:09] wool where it was forbidden for you to
[2:05:12] enter
[2:05:13] in the inner court with the wall
[2:05:16] you enter because of your self-will then
[2:05:19] they have to send you to shasgas
[2:05:22] in order to shear you through the
[2:05:24] tribulation
[2:05:25] period before you go back again
[2:05:30] go back to verse 14.
[2:05:33] in the evening she went and on the
[2:05:35] morrow she returned in the second house
[2:05:37] of the women
[2:05:38] to the custody of chess girls and the
[2:05:41] king
[2:05:41] the king's chamberlain which kept the
[2:05:44] concubine
[2:05:45] she came what no more
[2:05:49] except the king delighted her there is a
[2:05:53] little hope
[2:05:54] for those foolish version and that you
[2:05:57] were called by
[2:05:59] predestination that's why she's going
[2:06:01] through tribulation
[2:06:02] and the king is going to pull her up but
[2:06:05] even though they pull you up
[2:06:07] there is already a queen you're not
[2:06:09] going to be pulled back
[2:06:11] to be a queen esther is already there
[2:06:14] you are pull back not to be a queen you
[2:06:16] will never be the queen
[2:06:18] are you there you go through the sixth
[2:06:21] seal
[2:06:22] the purging of hagee are you there
[2:06:25] you say you believe you have not
[2:06:27] received the holy spirit
[2:06:28] something is wrong with your faith god
[2:06:31] circumcised the heart the meaning to the
[2:06:33] believer really
[2:06:34] comes in full surrendering when the
[2:06:37] believer
[2:06:38] firmly believes on the lord jesus christ
[2:06:40] god is under obligation to give him the
[2:06:42] holy ghost
[2:06:43] confirmation of his faith when esther
[2:06:46] entered with the faithful figure
[2:06:49] when the king looked the king put a seal
[2:06:52] put a crown that this faith i agree with
[2:06:55] it
[2:06:56] are you with me i agree with that
[2:06:59] faithful when you are safe
[2:07:00] you just hitting then the right road
[2:07:03] well
[2:07:04] believing doesn't give you it brother
[2:07:06] it's a gift
[2:07:07] but he gave him the sign of circumcision
[2:07:10] in commemoration
[2:07:12] as a memorial of his faith and today
[2:07:15] when we say that we believe
[2:07:16] we can believe in a measure but when god
[2:07:19] give us the baptism of the holy ghost
[2:07:21] he confirms our faith and sealers he
[2:07:26] confirmed that you
[2:07:27] fully surrender to haggai are you there
[2:07:31] the holy ghost is a confirmation of your
[2:07:34] faith in god
[2:07:35] god has confirmed and recognize it so
[2:07:39] and put a seal of approval on you are
[2:07:42] you there
[2:07:43] because you follow hey god you believe
[2:07:46] god that you say you believe god i have
[2:07:48] not received the holy spirit there is
[2:07:49] something wrong with your faith
[2:07:51] because god is on the obligation to give
[2:07:54] every believer that repent
[2:07:55] is baptized is under obligation to give
[2:07:58] you the
[2:07:59] baptism of the holy spirit and he's more
[2:08:01] willing to give it to you
[2:08:02] than you are to receive it that's right
[2:08:05] so there
[2:08:06] is something wrong somewhere you just
[2:08:08] got a mental
[2:08:09] fit instead of a hard faith but
[2:08:12] esther received the crown why did she
[2:08:15] receive the crime
[2:08:16] so she didn't want none of the adorning
[2:08:19] of the world
[2:08:20] she wanted to go in to the king just
[2:08:22] like she was
[2:08:24] she adorned herself themselves
[2:08:27] like the pentecostal woman or two with a
[2:08:30] meek
[2:08:30] humble spirit and when all these fancy
[2:08:34] first ladies come by we fought their new
[2:08:36] fantago
[2:08:37] things and king looked at them and put
[2:08:39] them put them in the chamber
[2:08:41] with the concubine but when these tester
[2:08:44] come in his side
[2:08:46] and she got a glimpse of that sweet
[2:08:48] humble
[2:08:49] make spirit he said that's her go get
[2:08:52] the crown
[2:08:53] and put it on her head that's it let
[2:08:56] them adorn themselves the foolish virgin
[2:08:58] with that kind of silver spirit actually
[2:09:01] not only women but
[2:09:02] men because we are the brother adorning
[2:09:05] themselves with that kind of spirit
[2:09:07] then you are becoming ready for the
[2:09:09] bread sweet
[2:09:10] reverend esther made hair
[2:09:14] malachi 4 to take the heart esther
[2:09:18] clean herself she cleaned her heart that
[2:09:21] is what she claimed
[2:09:22] that is what the church needs a heart
[2:09:24] cleaning how do you clean your heart
[2:09:26] brother branham
[2:09:27] washed by the water of the world through
[2:09:30] the blood of jesus christ
[2:09:31] esther purge her heart before god woke
[2:09:34] up with a meek and humble spirit
[2:09:36] the church that is going to be the bride
[2:09:39] of christ
[2:09:40] now remember esther refused the worldly
[2:09:43] adornment
[2:09:43] she took the spirit in her heart to go
[2:09:46] before the
[2:09:47] king are you there the church is a whole
[2:09:50] lot
[2:09:51] like it was in the days of esther esther
[2:09:54] didn't take
[2:09:55] the perfuming of the women she adorned
[2:09:57] herself with a modest apparel
[2:09:59] the hidden man of the heart and king
[2:10:01] said put the crown on her
[2:10:02] esther was the top of the church today
[2:10:05] those who are ready
[2:10:06] to come out and adorn themselves with
[2:10:08] the sweetness
[2:10:10] of the holy spirit are you there not
[2:10:13] perfuming
[2:10:14] and dressing off the world try to
[2:10:16] compare with them
[2:10:17] but that hidden men of the heart when
[2:10:20] esther
[2:10:20] was to be chosen to stand before the
[2:10:22] king she didn't adorn herself
[2:10:24] with all these things but she adorned
[2:10:27] herself with a sweet
[2:10:28] mixed period that is what the bread is
[2:10:31] adorning herself
[2:10:32] with all the fruit of the spirit
[2:10:34] following
[2:10:36] her everybody clear everybody clear
[2:10:39] everybody clear so next time
[2:10:44] on part 10 we're going to get now into
[2:10:47] the line of duty
[2:10:49] you need to be chosen in a light of duty
[2:10:53] what make that esther choice to be
[2:10:55] appointed
[2:10:56] into the position the adoption of esther
[2:11:00] how did he come back how did he come by
[2:11:03] why was esther appointed to be the queen
[2:11:06] she was appointed because of the last
[2:11:09] test of
[2:11:10] self-will she was ready to surrender
[2:11:13] that self-will completely and when you
[2:11:16] surrender that self-will
[2:11:18] when you remove yourself you accepted
[2:11:21] not your will but the king's will
[2:11:24] then you and the hagee and god will
[2:11:28] confirm
[2:11:29] that abraham believed god and he was
[2:11:32] imputed
[2:11:33] unto him for righteousness then god give
[2:11:36] the seal of circumcision
[2:11:38] to confirm the faith of abraham that i
[2:11:42] agree and i accepted that faith let's
[2:11:45] stand up
[2:11:48] praise the name of the lord as the
[2:11:50] musician comes
[2:11:54] this was a preparation to the line of
[2:11:57] duty
[2:11:59] because in the line of duty you must
[2:12:01] find favor with the king
[2:12:04] and to find favor with the king you must
[2:12:06] be chosen
[2:12:08] to be chosen you got to go through head
[2:12:10] you got to go through the purging of the
[2:12:12] holy spirit
[2:12:13] you got to die to yourself die to your
[2:12:15] american
[2:12:16] to your african to your european to your
[2:12:19] whichever country you come to
[2:12:21] die to whatever you come to and
[2:12:23] surrender to the message to the word
[2:12:26] and let the word lead you and when the
[2:12:29] word is leading you
[2:12:31] then the word will tell you the holy
[2:12:34] spirit
[2:12:35] will direct you and you're gonna do the
[2:12:37] things that pleases the king
[2:12:39] because hege knows what the king's like
[2:12:43] if you surrender he's gonna tell you
[2:12:45] what the king's like and when you get
[2:12:46] the secret of the king
[2:12:48] it's very easy to get favor with the
[2:12:50] kings
[2:12:51] then when you get favor with your king
[2:12:53] and when you are appointed
[2:12:54] and you are in the queen's position you
[2:12:57] are in your position
[2:12:58] then you are in the line of duty and
[2:13:01] when you got
[2:13:02] in the line of duty there is a secret to
[2:13:04] that one we will talk about it
[2:13:06] in the line of duty heavenly father lord
[2:13:09] we thank you again
[2:13:11] for your grace for your love for your
[2:13:13] mercy and for everything you do it for
[2:13:15] us
[2:13:16] father it has been in years that we walk
[2:13:20] in this message and many keys has been
[2:13:23] missed
[2:13:24] and we have questioned ourselves
[2:13:27] some got frustrated with the message
[2:13:30] and they left because they were
[2:13:32] disappointed
[2:13:34] they could see certain things happening
[2:13:36] in a nominal church
[2:13:38] and asking themselves why it doesn't
[2:13:40] happen around
[2:13:41] among the message rank some lord father
[2:13:44] has been struggling for a long time
[2:13:47] and they don't know why in certain
[2:13:49] people's life moving way
[2:13:51] better and their life still having
[2:13:53] struggled
[2:13:54] but lord you have given us a grace in
[2:13:56] this hour to open these
[2:13:59] keys to us the key of meditation
[2:14:02] the key to breaking to the sovereignty
[2:14:04] of god and tonight you have um fell
[2:14:06] unto us a major key because the edge of
[2:14:10] laodicea
[2:14:11] your prophet told us that laodicea means
[2:14:13] the people's right
[2:14:15] and father it's a very deadly fixed law
[2:14:18] because the right of the people
[2:14:22] is what bring our self will again to
[2:14:26] to to be resurrected where we want
[2:14:28] things to go our
[2:14:29] own ways we want stuff to be going on
[2:14:32] always
[2:14:33] we want the church to be drifted by our
[2:14:35] own will
[2:14:36] we want our families to be driven by our
[2:14:38] own will
[2:14:39] we want our decision to be driven a
[2:14:42] certain way
[2:14:43] and further by doing that we become more
[2:14:45] and more stranger
[2:14:47] to the inner coat lord father but you
[2:14:49] brought us the message
[2:14:51] you brought us to a different ministry
[2:14:53] lord
[2:14:54] where you are sharing the will
[2:14:56] completely and tonight you unveil unto
[2:14:58] us a major key
[2:15:00] telling us that we must surrender our
[2:15:03] will we must surrender our eye
[2:15:06] that's why your prophet even made a
[2:15:08] statement that the greatest
[2:15:10] enemy that he has is william marion
[2:15:13] prana
[2:15:13] because he is the one that get in the
[2:15:16] way of the lord
[2:15:17] and brother branham said that if i can
[2:15:19] overcome
[2:15:20] that enemy if i can overcome william
[2:15:23] marion branham
[2:15:24] if i can overcome myself then i can
[2:15:27] overcome
[2:15:28] every enemy how can you overcome
[2:15:31] yourself
[2:15:31] and be able to overcome every enemy
[2:15:34] because
[2:15:35] overcoming yourself will give the
[2:15:38] leadership of god
[2:15:39] to appoint you to your position and when
[2:15:42] you are in your position
[2:15:43] then you are in the line of duty then
[2:15:45] when you are in the line of duty
[2:15:47] then there is no enemy that can stand
[2:15:49] before you that you're not going to be
[2:15:51] able to knock out
[2:15:52] father these are major keys lord that
[2:15:55] has been missed in the church for a long
[2:15:57] time
[2:15:59] we have been doing things in our own way
[2:16:01] we have been using our head
[2:16:03] so much in spite of what solomon said
[2:16:06] that lead not unto their own
[2:16:08] understanding father may you help this
[2:16:10] church
[2:16:11] may you help the families of this church
[2:16:13] may you help those that are watching
[2:16:15] online
[2:16:16] to realize that their life is not their
[2:16:19] lives
[2:16:19] they need to surrender they need to stop
[2:16:22] foolishness
[2:16:23] they need to stop everything they're
[2:16:25] doing they need to recalibrate their
[2:16:27] life
[2:16:28] and measure their life with the revealed
[2:16:30] word of the hour
[2:16:31] and make sure whatever they're doing is
[2:16:34] pleasing unto the king
[2:16:36] because that which is pleasing unto the
[2:16:38] king open up the favor
[2:16:40] of the king in our life we have so many
[2:16:43] excuses
[2:16:44] we can say this happen we can say this
[2:16:46] is going on
[2:16:47] we can say this is this this this this
[2:16:50] and the devil got into
[2:16:51] all kind of excuses until we don't even
[2:16:54] concern about the things of god
[2:16:56] but father may you shake every family
[2:16:59] may you check
[2:17:00] every church may you check every juror
[2:17:03] may we check our motive may we check our
[2:17:06] objective may we check our heart may we
[2:17:09] check what are we doing
[2:17:10] may we check what is holding me at home
[2:17:13] that i don't want to be in church
[2:17:15] may we check what is making me not to
[2:17:17] read the bible
[2:17:18] what is making me not to listen to the
[2:17:21] message what is making me not doing
[2:17:23] things that are pleasing unto the king
[2:17:25] because then we can see where our
[2:17:28] shortcoming is
[2:17:29] and further then we can recalibrate our
[2:17:32] life
[2:17:32] by the power of the holy spirit it is
[2:17:34] impossible for you to speak the way you
[2:17:37] spoke tonight
[2:17:37] without you giving us power to overcome
[2:17:40] father made the people
[2:17:42] realize that unfolding these kids is
[2:17:45] telling them
[2:17:45] that there is an available anointing an
[2:17:48] available
[2:17:49] power that can help them move from the
[2:17:53] mediocrity the situation they are and
[2:17:56] move
[2:17:56] into a better situation for the pleasure
[2:17:59] of the king
[2:18:00] father we thank you for everything and
[2:18:02] we are committing this church unto the
[2:18:04] heaven
[2:18:04] lord may you take the oncoming service
[2:18:06] may you protect your children throughout
[2:18:08] the week
[2:18:09] may you remove every hindrance and every
[2:18:11] attack of the devil
[2:18:12] and may you continue to bless her as we
[2:18:14] humbly ask it father
[2:18:16] in the name of jesus christ in the name
[2:18:18] of jesus christ
[2:18:20] father lord if there is someone
[2:18:21] struggling someone who is sick
[2:18:24] someone who has trouble who need a
[2:18:26] solution or an answer
[2:18:27] lord may you minister unto them father
[2:18:30] lord we committed all
[2:18:31] and we are putting everything on the
[2:18:33] mutual law even this church
[2:18:35] is not directed by men i told my wife
[2:18:38] i'm a mutual
[2:18:39] father you the holy spirit because you
[2:18:41] again you know what this church
[2:18:43] what the women need lord father for
[2:18:45] their purging
[2:18:46] their purification you know what they
[2:18:48] need to be pleasing unto the king
[2:18:50] and you are providing these keys lord
[2:18:53] father as each one of
[2:18:54] us tonight lord everyone is praying for
[2:18:57] their own family
[2:18:58] for their own situation father may you
[2:19:00] minister to them
[2:19:01] and give them the desire of their heart
[2:19:04] lord we must say that the service is a
[2:19:06] little bit longer
[2:19:07] but how many times do we spend praying
[2:19:09] father we are in
[2:19:10] in every other kind of stuff but we
[2:19:12] don't even have time to pray
[2:19:14] lord we are praying together you spoke
[2:19:16] to us lord
[2:19:17] that when two or three are gathered
[2:19:20] together asking for something lord
[2:19:22] you will give it unto us father may you
[2:19:24] granted because we're coming
[2:19:26] and asking in the name of jesus christ
[2:19:28] father we only ask it and surrender
[2:19:30] everything lord in the name of jesus
[2:19:32] christ in the name of jesus christ

[2:19:39] hallelujah you can come in my brother
[2:19:43] god bless you church we love you
[2:19:48] [Music]
[2:19:56] amen you know i thought
[2:20:01] i thought i've read the book of esther
[2:20:02] before but
[2:20:04] um i don't know uh i need to go back and
[2:20:07] read it again
[2:20:09] i tell you what that's what reading the
[2:20:11] bible
[2:20:12] uh without a revelation you know and
[2:20:15] that's why
[2:20:16] brother brandt said one of the greatest
[2:20:17] things you can pray for is a great
[2:20:18] revelation and
[2:20:19] tonight i received a greater revelation
[2:20:22] around the book of esther more than i've
[2:20:24] ever
[2:20:24] in my life and i know it's not just by
[2:20:27] the work of stephen shango but i know
[2:20:28] it's about the work of the holy spirit
[2:20:30] working through our pastor
[2:20:31] working through this church and i'll
[2:20:33] tell you what it's a tremendous blessing
[2:20:36] hearing about how esther found favor by
[2:20:39] putting her car in neutral
[2:20:40] by surrendering her own self-will by the
[2:20:42] character of esther
[2:20:44] and that's why brother and brother bram
[2:20:46] says one of the only things we'll take
[2:20:47] with us is our character
[2:20:49] and that's why i pray lord give me the
[2:20:50] right character give me the character
[2:20:52] to surrender my own self-will to
[2:20:54] whatever you have for me
[2:20:56] whatever your plan is um brother branham
[2:20:59] also said i rather
[2:21:00] i rather you be right in your spirit and
[2:21:03] wrong
[2:21:03] in your doctrine because if you're able
[2:21:05] to put your car in neutral
[2:21:07] god can correct a doctrine but if you're
[2:21:09] if your
[2:21:10] spirit isn't right and that takes more
[2:21:12] work for god to correct so
[2:21:14] i pray we just have the right spirit i
[2:21:16] pray i have the right spirit
[2:21:17] and then god if there's an error in my
[2:21:19] doctrine god can bring that out
[2:21:21] but i'm just that was amazing that was
[2:21:25] outstanding
[2:21:26] uh i was i'll tell you was
[2:21:29] it was i have to go back and listen to
[2:21:31] it again because i feel like i might
[2:21:32] have missed some stuff and
