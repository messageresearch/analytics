Now, the Pharisee waited for this certain time and they know when to make this banquet when everything was just right.

For some reason it stopped yesterday. So they will call a technician but we got our backup. &gt;&gt; We are recording everything. Everything is under recording and no problem at all. But for the invisible audience when you see when it's loaded on YouTube, we greet you all in the precious name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ both visible and invisible audience. So our apology invisible audience, it's not my fault. You blame the devil. So you pray and then uh pray for the church. It's an issue with the internet, but we got to back up. Everything has been recorded and Lord's willing, we will upload that on YouTube at the appropriate time. Amen. &gt;&gt; So you pray with us and thank God we have another alternative for another Verizon uh internet. So that's the one we're using to record everything. So all is well by God's grace and sometime it pays to be in church. Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Any families member here, God richly bless you. Brother Lusenov, I see you there with your wife, God bless you. You just stand and whoever first time, second time, just stand so we can welcome you. Praise God. Long time no see. God bless you and welcome to Spoken Word. You may be seated. You home. You're not a visitor. You a family member. Amen. So if you want to say amen, you say amen. You want to shout, you shout. Just be free. This is another home for you. Amen. And good to see you. God richly bless you and we trust the family and everybody is doing well. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Sister Sharon, you can check sister if she calls you by God's grace. And then uh I have uh I'm going to go through my announcement quickly. I believe we are up to date with the sermon. We're reading our Bible twice a day, our cood book, church ages. And I'm happy the younger one are picking up on church ages. I'm so happy because you will learn stuff by yourself. It seems like the spirit of the Lord is moving with the young and I'm so happy about it. So we reading our church ages, our 70 weeks, the seals adoption or somebody is listening to the message of the hour. I went to sleep with brother Brandon playing. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Uh so if you don't do it, that's your problem. You know the message is free. It's online. Just hit the button and you'll be fine. I remember when I had a flip phone, I was praying God. I say the day I'm going to have a phone when I would just click because at the beginning years ago, you have to download the message and to play it and then your phone before you know it is full. So I was praying. I said, Lord, when I would get a night phone, when I would just hit it and brother and finally everybody have it. But how many time do we listen to the message? Now it's another problem. Amen. So everything is in your hand. Make sure you take advantage before they tell you that your internet is off. &gt;&gt; And then you will realize what you've been missing all along. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. You might have your alarm and everything at home once the internet is off. That's it. &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You can't even view your camera. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So the always is always better. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Question and answer. I'm still waiting on Bronn Glenn to let me know. We're working with the facility to let me know when is the next session and once the deacon finalized I will give you the date. And the young man meeting was wonderful yesterday. I put the summary there. So parent you will see what I spoke with the children and if you have a question you can pull them aside and ask them what did you learn today and they should be able to tell you. Amen. But it was a tremendous blessing. We went there. I don't know how many hours was it, &gt;&gt; but what three hours and they still don't want me to stop. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I say, "Can we stop?" And they said, "No." I was like, "Oh my god." So now it's hitting home. They know the three category of women. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's on a group chat. They know three category of women &gt;&gt; and who to court. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because usually when you tell youth we have a youth meeting and then the first thing I mean it's about courtship everybody's waiting okay what is the first step what is the second I said no no no no no no you are patriarch and I understood why brother Brandham say he had a meeting with the boys separate and then with the girls separate. I don't mind having a meeting together with boys and girls but brother Brham did it separately. You need to stay under the headship &gt;&gt; of brother Brham. Regardless of what you think, brother Brham will be always right. &gt;&gt; Amen. And I notice with my own experience when I'm talking to the boys, it's a different anointing. &gt;&gt; And I see things differently because whatever they learn yesterday, none of the girl have any idea of what they learned yesterday. It's like a different channel. And brother Tony said, "Brother Stephen, if any of them got a wrong woman, it's their own fault." &gt;&gt; Amen. In other words, everything was planned. &gt;&gt; Brother Angel is right here. You you saw him. Ah, so he's telling you everything was planned. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Three category of women. &gt;&gt; Three of them. &gt;&gt; So parent, let's stay with the with the correct category. &gt;&gt; Don't come to me and try to negotiate something that is not in the word. I am not going to buy it. I'm not going to be part of it. You're going to do it yourself and brother Stephen won't be there. &gt;&gt; And don't put pressure on me. &gt;&gt; And don't put pressure in the church. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And don't come and say, "Well, so we put a standard." The standard is the word of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And and yesterday they they they even learn why God say he hated Esau. &gt;&gt; That's right. Wow. &gt;&gt; Because the Bible say before Esau was born, the scripture say, "I love Jacob and I hated Esau." And usually there is one thing we know about Esau is just because he despised the birthight. &gt;&gt; But yesterday they they saw more than the birthight. &gt;&gt; Esau was a troublemaker. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And his trouble was with women. Amen. &gt;&gt; Ask the young men, they will give you the scripture. &gt;&gt; Every wife that Esau got was a trouble. &gt;&gt; And the Bible say those women cause trouble to the parent. &gt;&gt; You don't marry a woman that will be a trouble to the family. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen my friend? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You don't bring a woman in the family and she begin to cause trouble. The Bible say [Applause] &gt;&gt; the Bible even say that Rebecca &gt;&gt; told Isaac &gt;&gt; that I cannot leave anymore. I don't even want to leave anymore because of the wife of Esau. &gt;&gt; It's written in the Bible. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Because there were three type of women. There is a woman from the lineage of Abraham &gt;&gt; and there was a woman from the lineage of Ishmael. &gt;&gt; Look at your group chart. And there was a woman from the Canaanite &gt;&gt; and Esau married the Canaanite women &gt;&gt; and the Bible said they caused trouble to the parent &gt;&gt; until Rebecca say I don't want to leave because of this. Amen. &gt;&gt; And Rebecca told Isaac, he said, "A Isaac, if Jacob ever marry a woman from the Canaanite, I'm doomed." &gt;&gt; I'm going to the tomb. I'm finished. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, Abraham called uh I mean uh Isaac called Jacob and he said, "Jacob, I don't want you to get married among the Canaanites. Yes, &gt;&gt; I want you to go back &gt;&gt; to my country. [Music] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The country where Rebecca came from. &gt;&gt; That's where Rachel was. &gt;&gt; He said, "You go back to the country &gt;&gt; and then go over there and go find a woman." Amen. And Rebecca was picked at the well. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And Jacob met Rachel at the well. And when Rebecca was picked, she was not even prepared for the banquet. &gt;&gt; No, sir. &gt;&gt; She was working. &gt;&gt; She went to pick up the stuff for work. &gt;&gt; Didn't know it was her marriage. &gt;&gt; When Rachel met Jacob, she was working. &gt;&gt; She was bringing the sheep of her father. Amen. &gt;&gt; When the young man came from Chicago, &gt;&gt; when he came down, he met his wife on the backyard working. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In other words, they picked those women when they were natural. &gt;&gt; Natural. &gt;&gt; Great. As a young man, you go into a youth meeting, all of them are dressed for the impression. [Applause] &gt;&gt; They are dressed to impress you. &gt;&gt; You need to be careful how you picking up. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. [Applause] &gt;&gt; There are certain language I talk to them. I'm on YouTube. I won't tell you because I talk to men. The deacon knows. There are certain stuff I show them. &gt;&gt; I say because some of you are naive. &gt;&gt; You were not accustomed to women. &gt;&gt; So I need to open up your mind. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So you know how to deal with a sister and decode what is going on. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; You wasting your time. That's your problem. Amen. I say the woman you going to pick up over there, &gt;&gt; you don't really know where her hair is. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Huh? &gt;&gt; I have my wife, younger sister. Before she got married, the young man came, she stopped. She say, "Hey, before we continue further, she did this. She said, "Look at me." &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; This is the way I am. &gt;&gt; And she ended up getting married. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; I say young man, you going there. Oh, youth gathering. Youth gathering. Oh, no. Are we together? &gt;&gt; Go to her home. &gt;&gt; Go to the house. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And you're going to see the real deal. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm trying to block myself. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. They know what I told them. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; They know what I told them. I told them more than what I'm saying here. If you can read between the line, you can see how deep I went with them. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. I say because you're going to make one choice &gt;&gt; and you don't come out. &gt;&gt; I say if you complain, I talk to you. I'll advise you and take you back to your home and sh you back in and lock the door. I say you continue over there until the coming of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I say brother, you will hate your home. &gt;&gt; The home have nothing to do with it. &gt;&gt; The bed is not a problem. Your couch have nothing. It is the woman that is living inside. &gt;&gt; I say but if you find a good one, &gt;&gt; the one the Lord gave you, then you a happy man the rest of your life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And you will say marriage is a good thing because the Bible say whoever found a good a woman has found a good thing and found favor from the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In other words, the one choosing the woman is not you. &gt;&gt; No sir. [Applause] [Music] Some of you are lost. &gt;&gt; You see how you going? When I will begin to preach, you will start looking at that way. &gt;&gt; The Bible says, "Whoever findeth a woman &gt;&gt; foundeth a good thing," &gt;&gt; and we know what good means. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Huh? Whoever findeth a woman findeth what? &gt;&gt; A good thing. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; He has found favor with the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So in other words, to find a good woman, you must find favor with the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So actually, who is picking up the woman? &gt;&gt; God. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Who picked up Eve? &gt;&gt; God. &gt;&gt; Who brought Eve? &gt;&gt; God. &gt;&gt; Who manufactured Eve? God [Applause] &gt;&gt; preach. &gt;&gt; I gave them another quote, another scripture the Bible because it looks like you loving this. &gt;&gt; And I told them yesterday, I say if I give this to married couple, you will see how they saying amen. What did I tell you yesterday? Did you hear amen? The Bible says house &gt;&gt; and riches &gt;&gt; you will inherit them from your father. &gt;&gt; It's written in the Bible. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; But a woman &gt;&gt; is inherited from the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I have the quote, my friend. &gt;&gt; In other and and when when the scripture say inheritance, &gt;&gt; it means it didn't belong to you. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. It was for somebody. &gt;&gt; So your wife was for God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It was the property of God. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And God inherits you. &gt;&gt; So when you getting married, you're getting an inheritance of a daughter of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? It's a gift. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's a gift from God. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Brother Joshua was on fire. &gt;&gt; Enoch was on fire. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Brother Angelo was there like this. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; And when Esau heard it &gt;&gt; that Abraham is h Isaac is talking to Jacob. &gt;&gt; Go marry over there. &gt;&gt; Yes. If you notice, Esau was revealed the source &gt;&gt; of where the correct women are coming from. &gt;&gt; And the Bible says to please his father, he went and got another wife from the daughter of Ishmael. Even though the source was disclosed to him &gt;&gt; because he's of the seed of Cain, &gt;&gt; even when they show them the revelation like do like your brother, still there is nothing in them to do it. &gt;&gt; And if you notice the second time Issach got married, he went to pick up a daughter from Ishmael. &gt;&gt; And Ishmael is from the seed of Abraham. &gt;&gt; But it's a cast away woman. In other words, when he bring that one, he say, "What else do you want?" Ismael was a son of Abraham. &gt;&gt; You are exaggerating. &gt;&gt; She's in the message, too. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Are we together? Are we together? &gt;&gt; Do you know the origin of Ishmael? Ishmael came from a combination of Abraham &gt;&gt; and Hagar which was an Egyptian who was an Egyptian. &gt;&gt; So it's Abraham with Egypt. &gt;&gt; It's the word and the world &gt;&gt; that are combined together. &gt;&gt; I say if so went to pick up a woman in the message but that is worldly. &gt;&gt; Amen. to try to please the parent &gt;&gt; that at least she's in the message. &gt;&gt; I say, "But watch her in the message." &gt;&gt; I told them all. &gt;&gt; I say, "Young man, if you see a sister &gt;&gt; that is very close to the world, &gt;&gt; I say psychologically take earring." &gt;&gt; I talked to them yesterday. I say take earring and put on that sister in your mind. &gt;&gt; If you put earring in your mind, you will see that she now &gt;&gt; looks exactly like the world. In other words, the only difference &gt;&gt; that you know she's a sister is because she does an earring. &gt;&gt; But if you look at her, her clothing are tight. [Applause] &gt;&gt; She have high heel like this. &gt;&gt; Thank you. My God, &gt;&gt; I'm going to stop. I told them more than that. &gt;&gt; If you notice the way she is, that's a daughter of Ishmael. &gt;&gt; You stay away from her. &gt;&gt; Even though she's in the message, but she's flooding with the world. &gt;&gt; She doesn't listen to her father. &gt;&gt; No, sir. &gt;&gt; No, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. She doesn't listen to her mother. &gt;&gt; No, sir. She doesn't listen to the pastor. &gt;&gt; No sir. &gt;&gt; She doesn't listen to deacon. &gt;&gt; Even at work, she doesn't obey her supervisor. Sir, &gt;&gt; is she going to listen to you? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. [Applause] &gt;&gt; The Bible say &gt;&gt; Jacob obey his father and his mother. I read to them yesterday. I say young man, you have a godly mother, a godly parent. Obey them. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And when he went, he picked up Rachel. &gt;&gt; And from there came Joseph and Benjamin. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Perfection and the 144,000 &gt;&gt; because he was from the correct lineage. [Applause] &gt;&gt; So that's where we stop. I say, who do you court? &gt;&gt; I say you have your own answer. And when you bring me a woman, I say Esau, his choice was a Canaanite. And I pulled the quote. Brother Brandham say the woman that a man marries &gt;&gt; reflect his ambition. &gt;&gt; I gave them the quote. &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham say he also reflect what is down deep in that man. No matter how much and brother Brandham said no matter how much a man is saying from his mouth. Brother Brham say watch who she marries. I gave them the code. &gt;&gt; If Esau marry a Canaanite &gt;&gt; who was from the lineage of Satan what was done in Esau. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's why God hated Esau. [Applause] Yes sir. And I told them, I say, "Young man, &gt;&gt; when you see a sister and she prick your heart, &gt;&gt; push the brake. &gt;&gt; Watch that sister. &gt;&gt; If she's worldly, it means you need deliverance." &gt;&gt; There is something in you that is bad &gt;&gt; that is thirsting after bad women. &gt;&gt; There is something in you that is testing after hypocrite women. &gt;&gt; You need to get that thing clean up. Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Before you even brother say before you make a choice &gt;&gt; of a woman you need to plan. I gave them the quote yesterday. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; I have I have everything on the court. &gt;&gt; I gave it to them &gt;&gt; parent. I gave you a summary &gt;&gt; of what I spoke to the young men. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Church. I gave you a summary of what I spoke to the young men. I told them, I said, "From today, &gt;&gt; I'm waiting for you to present to me who you have in mind." &gt;&gt; And the day you presented to me, I will know who you are. &gt;&gt; Once I look at the sister, I say, "My boy is still struggling." Amen. &gt;&gt; I told them I said the women at your school are not they those are &gt;&gt; Canaanite. &gt;&gt; The woman in college canite. &gt;&gt; I say in the message you be careful because we got each manites. [Applause] &gt;&gt; I told them I said watch their fingers. You will see their finger on &gt;&gt; if they start painting in a certain way. I say my boy back up a little bit. &gt;&gt; Say amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; There are certain things I tell them to watch. &gt;&gt; Some of them are the secret between me and the boys. Uh you see because they say the if the pastor tell tell he tell it all. So let me keep the secret between the daddy and the boys. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? Because Paul say in the marriage there is trouble in the flesh. &gt;&gt; I say so young man by default &gt;&gt; you have a percentage of trouble. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In the marriage that won't be taken out. I say so when you are negotiating with a woman &gt;&gt; you need to now you and I pick up I say you have already 20% by default &gt;&gt; sir &gt;&gt; because you still in the flesh &gt;&gt; that sometime your wife may get upset or something you need to negotiate with that &gt;&gt; I say so when you're looking for a woman you are not dealing with 80% of peace or war [Applause] Some of you are now losing the GPS. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; I say, but if you find a daughter of God &gt;&gt; who has been clean by the Holy Ghost, [Music] &gt;&gt; then you know that you're receiving 80% of peace &gt;&gt; and the 20% the Holy Ghost will help you manage it. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. [Applause] &gt;&gt; I know question are firing in your mind. I gave them a scripture. Paul say I would that all of you remain single. I gave it to them. &gt;&gt; I say why is the apostle saying you need to remain single? I say but God in the in Genesis say it is not good for men to be alone. Put them together. You ask them the question. &gt;&gt; The answer. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Marriage is a good thing. &gt;&gt; It's reflecting God &gt;&gt; but it need to be done correctly. &gt;&gt; I say young man I'm calling you patriarch because the bloodline travel through men. Amen. &gt;&gt; I say your sister will go to another bloodline &gt;&gt; but the bloodline goes to the male. &gt;&gt; So you as a male in the family you need to be careful. &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham say the woman I gave them the code. Brother Brandham say the woman that you choose &gt;&gt; for to marry &gt;&gt; the way she is is the way she will make her children. Amen. &gt;&gt; My friend, this is code. &gt;&gt; I'm giving you quote. You quiet. &gt;&gt; Great. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; My friend, did I read to you the quote? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Did I give you the reference? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Brother Brham said, &gt;&gt; if you marry a woman, &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham say, watch the way she is. &gt;&gt; Watch the way she is. That's the way she will make your children grow. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I have more than this. I I spoke three hours with them. Brother Brandham say the woman that you choose tells you how you are thinking about your future, your children. &gt;&gt; Your children. I say young man, you love your mother. &gt;&gt; But you must love your wife more than that. &gt;&gt; I say so now how I I say [Music] Brother say the woman you marry is exactly reflecting you. &gt;&gt; I say young man when you look at a sister that prick your heart &gt;&gt; push the brake &gt;&gt; push the brake. &gt;&gt; Does she look like you? &gt;&gt; Can you see yourself in that woman? If you don't see yourself move &gt;&gt; married couple meeting will be on September. [Laughter] &gt;&gt; I'm saying this because parent doesn't have time to be with me there. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm dealing with young men. Yes. &gt;&gt; So I'm giving you an idea what we went through. &gt;&gt; So none of the young men can bring me something contrary to what they got presented. &gt;&gt; You will find another pastor to marry you. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; A Canaanite I won't lay hand on you. &gt;&gt; Anite I know you going to be doomed for trouble. &gt;&gt; Bring me a daughter of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And the family will be happy. I say a woman when she enter the family, &gt;&gt; she's blending. [Music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; I said that's what we want. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Because God told Israel, when you go to Canaan, do not marry those women. &gt;&gt; Amen, brother. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; For a reason. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And I gave them the last quote for the day. Brother Brham say you marry someone that believe exactly like you. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Not like you. Exactly like you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's why we need to be careful in the message. &gt;&gt; Are we together? Amen. &gt;&gt; So next young man meetings find the date and let's move on my friend. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; That will be code sheep part two. I'm taking my time digging the foundation sir &gt;&gt; before I begin to erect the wall. I have quote where brotherham shows the specification of a woman to marry. I have quote brother say she must be this this this this. I'm going to give it to them. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because Paul say you enter don't come out. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's a it's a scripture and Paul say when you come out don't go &gt;&gt; and when you are still outside Paul say stay outside &gt;&gt; but we burning &gt;&gt; Paul say then go back and marry you didn't sin but just know &gt;&gt; some of you are having a hard time understanding me when Adam was alone. &gt;&gt; Alone. &gt;&gt; Was he tempted? &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; I'm asking you the Bible. Was he tempted? &gt;&gt; Did you see the devil playing with Adam? &gt;&gt; When they created Eve, &gt;&gt; did you see the devil coming? &gt;&gt; But when God made a ceremony &gt;&gt; and unite Adam and Eve, &gt;&gt; the devil woke up. &gt;&gt; The beast that was in the garden. now rose up &gt;&gt; because the devil hate marriage. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; The devil hate marriage. I say the wrong thing we do in the gospel is we tell you come to the gospel and all your trouble are finished. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham say don't do that. &gt;&gt; I say that's why I'm telling you all young men &gt;&gt; if I tell you come to your marriage and all your trouble is finished. No, you are entering war zone. I say as an advice from your pastor, &gt;&gt; prepare for the worst, &gt;&gt; but expect the best. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You didn't get me well. Prepare for the worst, &gt;&gt; but expect what? &gt;&gt; The best. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In other words, until when you enter, you have so much ammunition and you say, "Ah, brother Steph, you loaded me too much. This is a piece of cakeless. &gt;&gt; That's where I want you. &gt;&gt; Rather than you entering and you taking in ambush &gt;&gt; like I never thought I'm going into something like this. &gt;&gt; Uh now you dealing with it. Some of the stuff I leave between me and the boys and uh they won't tell you mama no matter how you push. [Laughter] They know why they won't tell you. They know exactly what I tell you. Unless you push really hard. Amen. They can tell daddy, but they won't tell you because they're boys. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen.

I told them, whoever was already engaged into a relationship, &gt;&gt; refilter the relationship. &gt;&gt; If it doesn't, it's not good. Pull back up. &gt;&gt; And I told them, avoid messing around with women. &gt;&gt; Because you're texting a sister, you're texting a sister, you're texting a sister, then the sister already thinking you want her. &gt;&gt; And the day you will go to another sister, then brother Steven is called on the call.

If you there, you can say amen. &gt;&gt; Verse one. Amen. The Bible say, "And Jacob called his son, call to his son and say, gather yourself together that I may tell you that which shall befall you in the last days." This is Jacob calling his children to bless them. Everybody clear? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You might be seated as we're preparing to take off for attendant. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen.

Then tomorrow they tell you brother Brandham is not a prophet. and you begin to believe &gt;&gt; because no no no no no no teaching no foundation &gt;&gt; father Brandham say Paul was taking a man and sat with him &gt;&gt; and grant the man &gt;&gt; this is what I'm doing doing with these young people grant them &gt;&gt; amen Jesus Jesus Jesus tomorrow 20 is &gt;&gt; when you say the first and the latter &gt;&gt; it's called mur &gt;&gt; you say immor &gt;&gt; in the message 20 minutes &gt;&gt; 20 years &gt;&gt; you don't know &gt;&gt; immoral &gt;&gt; amen &gt;&gt; amen &gt;&gt; amen &gt;&gt; lord have mercy &gt;&gt; issakar &gt;&gt; Amen is a strong ass, &gt;&gt; a strong donkey. &gt;&gt; So this tribe have already strength. &gt;&gt; Correct. Amen. &gt;&gt; Strong as an ass &gt;&gt; which is a beast of burden. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So Issachah has a strength to carry burden. &gt;&gt; Issaka is strong as what? an as &gt;&gt; as an as. &gt;&gt; So strength is already granted. These are blessing. &gt;&gt; This is bless and these blessing are actually revelation. &gt;&gt; They are revealing what is in the sun. What is in that tribe? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Issachar is strong as a naz. Amen. &gt;&gt; Couching down. In other words, he's laying down &gt;&gt; between two burdens. &gt;&gt; That word burdens means sheepfold. &gt;&gt; Amen. So when Issacha is laying, if you look over here, it's a sheepfold. You look on the other side, it's a sheepfold right there. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; So Issachar is a tribe that will be blessed &gt;&gt; by a pastorialum, &gt;&gt; a livestock. &gt;&gt; Are we together? I'm going this slowly because this is deep. We clear my friend. &gt;&gt; So it's a tribe that is blessed with livestock with uh sheep whatever cattle whatever you call them. So when you see where Issacha is laying, this is prophecy that is putting these children in the promised land. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Remember they are in Egypt &gt;&gt; and they are giving them prophecy to happen over there in the promised land. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; And then when Jacob as a prophet is climbing a prophetic realm &gt;&gt; he look at Issachar he say hey the position of Issachar first of all he's strong &gt;&gt; like a n number one. Number two, assuming his position, he's laying in the promised land where there is a lot of livestock. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; The livestock on the right side and the livestock on the left side. And Issaka is laying there. &gt;&gt; So this tribe is in a prosperous area. &gt;&gt; Correct. &gt;&gt; Are we together &gt;&gt; in the promised land? Uh verse uh 15. And he saw that rest was what &gt;&gt; good. &gt;&gt; So Isaka have a rest &gt;&gt; and he have a good rest. &gt;&gt; In other words, his place is pacific. &gt;&gt; It's peaceful. &gt;&gt; Isakar has a good rest. &gt;&gt; You can take it spiritually &gt;&gt; or you can take it peacefully. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; A pacific place. That's where Issachar lays. Today you're gonna learn Issachar. Amen. &gt;&gt; The Bible say, "And he saw that rest was good and that and the land that he was how &gt;&gt; pleasant." &gt;&gt; So the land that Issacha will occupy in the promised land will be a good land. &gt;&gt; I hope you are understanding me. &gt;&gt; Land was how &gt;&gt; pleasant. And remember land and livestock goes together. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; So this is a good place for agriculture. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; So if you go where is in the promised land, it's a fertile place. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All of this because of the opening of the seals. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You are now reading the scripture. You are now getting we are now getting below the under the scripture. Amen. So if you want to find is I mean Issachar in the promised land search for the best land &gt;&gt; where there is livestock &gt;&gt; rich in agriculture. Are we together? And a peaceful place.

This is Issachar. You there? &gt;&gt; 1 Chronicle 12 verse one. Now these are they that came to David to Ziglag. While he yet kept himself close in other word hiding because of Saul the son of Kish &gt;&gt; and they were among the mighty men helper of water &gt;&gt; war. So when David was already hiding from uh from Saul, &gt;&gt; leader by leader, &gt;&gt; people begin to leave the kingdom of Saul. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And they begin to come &gt;&gt; step by step &gt;&gt; to the kingdom of David. They begin to transfer &gt;&gt; to David &gt;&gt; because the anointing of God &gt;&gt; was already in David &gt;&gt; and they s the anointing was going into David &gt;&gt; and the anointing left Saul. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; So over time the people begin to migrate &gt;&gt; from uh the kingdom of Saul &gt;&gt; unto David and David was now growing up. Yes. &gt;&gt; Until the Bible say he became like a big army of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; And we can go through this step, but I'm going to skip and go to Issachar. But if you go straight, you will see that there was so many a thousand from Judah, a thousand from Benjamin, a thousand for so leader by leader, the church of David begin to grow. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And the The church the church was growing from the people that were living &gt;&gt; at the churches and coming to David and David continued to grow as a big army. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because the anointing was already indicating where God is. A man after God's own heart. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham said David represented Christ. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; So over time Christ will draw everybody. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; And Christ is not brother Steven. &gt;&gt; But the message brother Steven is preaching is Christ. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; It is the sermon. The message that brother Steven is preaching that is drawing people. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Not brother Steven. The message. Amen. &gt;&gt; The message, the word &gt;&gt; that is coming up is pulling people. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't get mad on me. &gt;&gt; When you getting mad on me, you getting mad on the word. &gt;&gt; Go ahead. &gt;&gt; Because I'm not the one doing that. It's the word. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. [Applause] &gt;&gt; How do I know all this stuff? with my intelligence. &gt;&gt; No, it is the almighty God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That is using me as a vessel. &gt;&gt; But it's Christ who's talking. &gt;&gt; And it's Christ who's attracting his children because the hour is late. &gt;&gt; Amen. [Applause] &gt;&gt; It's hard to say things like this because people will say he begin to show himself up. I don't care what you say. I'm simply I'm speaking the truth. &gt;&gt; Go ahead. Go ahead. &gt;&gt; If you want to bring people to your church, preach the message in its purity. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Brothers and sister, wherever you are, if you state preach the message correctly, God will send the ego. Because where the carcass is, &gt;&gt; where the caucus is, &gt;&gt; you won't block the ego. &gt;&gt; Go ahead. &gt;&gt; The ego will go where the car is. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? Yeah, &gt;&gt; my friend here I'm having a steak, &gt;&gt; mashed potato &gt;&gt; and gravy &gt;&gt; and you are sitting there with a 25 cent chips &gt;&gt; and you look in there it's food. &gt;&gt; What is your normal sense? You say &gt;&gt; drop this my friend &gt;&gt; go get go eat. &gt;&gt; If you stay there you starve. [Applause] We got problem in the message because some are preaching the message, some are lowering and playing with the message. &gt;&gt; And now it's a problem. If you preach the message, we preach the message, we won't have any problem. &gt;&gt; But you don't preach the message. That's why it's a problem. That's why the church is called &gt;&gt; the restoration of the word bring the restoration of the power. &gt;&gt; So the ego are not after the preacher they after the word &gt;&gt; where the cases that's where the ego goes. Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? That's why God got you in trouble with the internet. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Because now ego can search themselves &gt;&gt; and say, "Preacher so and so over there in Europe. Preacher so and so over there in America. Preacher so and so over there in Africa. He preaches the word." Every day they sit. No, no, no. They're not looking at the preacher. They are looking for the word. &gt;&gt; Don't get jealous of the preacher. Go dig the word &gt;&gt; and preach the word. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Where are we at, my friend? &gt;&gt; You remember when I lose GPS, I come to you. So, you need to stay on board. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Where are we at? &gt;&gt; Ah, chapter 12. So, the people begin to migrate &gt;&gt; and David begin to grow. &gt;&gt; But we are focusing on the tribe of what? Issachar. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Where is Issachar in 1 Chronicle 12? Job to verse 32. &gt;&gt; If I can finish this reading, Lord have mercy. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are you there? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You there. &gt;&gt; Now before we read together, remember Isakar is strong. &gt;&gt; Love stock right there. Blessed peacefully. Everything is there. He got the gold. He got the the what? the mineral, the fishing and the everything. Happiness is in his tent and everything. The only risk that is uh Issachar is is to avoid to be put under slavery. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Because of this risk, look how Isaka compensate [Music] &gt;&gt; to keep watch over the risk. Amen. &gt;&gt; In other words, Isaka you are blessed so much &gt;&gt; but be careful there is slavery around you &gt;&gt; and because of that Isaka got a weapon &gt;&gt; against slavery. &gt;&gt; What is that weapon? &gt;&gt; Now we are getting into &gt;&gt; into the meat. &gt;&gt; Verse 32. And of the children of what? &gt;&gt; Which were men that had what? &gt;&gt; Understanding of the time. &gt;&gt; Understanding of what? God knew &gt;&gt; the season. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So Isaka knew the season. &gt;&gt; I'm reading the Bible. Issaka, the men of Isaka, &gt;&gt; they were not just like prosperity, prosperity. &gt;&gt; Our land is rich. All right. &gt;&gt; Our land depend on agriculture. &gt;&gt; So we need to be watching the time. &gt;&gt; We need to know which time is good for the flock, &gt;&gt; which time is good for the agriculture, which time is in other words, Issaka got a wisdom. &gt;&gt; To discern &gt;&gt; the time. &gt;&gt; Amen. And when David is about to take the throne, God touched the man of Issachar &gt;&gt; to bring wisdom to David. &gt;&gt; Now David, you need us beside you &gt;&gt; because we know why how to discern the time. &gt;&gt; We can tell you what to do. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Isakar have an understanding against this thing. &gt;&gt; So if you try to bring uh slavery to Isakar, They will just look at you like this and the discernment kick in. &gt;&gt; They say, "Watch out my brother." &gt;&gt; Isaka, it's men that have what? &gt;&gt; Wisdom. &gt;&gt; Wisdom. &gt;&gt; Understanding. &gt;&gt; Understanding. &gt;&gt; Understanding of what? &gt;&gt; Of the times. &gt;&gt; Is it not? Is it singular or plural? &gt;&gt; Plural. &gt;&gt; Understanding of what? &gt;&gt; The times. &gt;&gt; Not just time, but times. So if you want to know the true calendar, &gt;&gt; how things are supposed to go &gt;&gt; when you get in Israel, which tribe do you have to go to? &gt;&gt; It's a car. &gt;&gt; You see now that this prosperity, this richness, this wealth is connected to wisdom. [Music] &gt;&gt; I don't know if you get it. This wealth of the land is connected to wisdom. &gt;&gt; I'm going to repeat it again. This wealth, this prosperity is not just prosperity without any guidance. It's a prosperity connected to wisdom. [Applause] &gt;&gt; It's a white hair. &gt;&gt; There is a wisdom that is in that trap. &gt;&gt; It's a trap connected to wisdom. Amen. Yes sir. &gt;&gt; So the message is not just rich. &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; But the message is rich because the wisdom the mind of God &gt;&gt; is right there &gt;&gt; and help us discern the time. &gt;&gt; So when we see the pope is entering &gt;&gt; the man of Isach begin to prepare for the going home because they know how to design that time. Are we together? &gt;&gt; Spoken word. Are we together? &gt;&gt; See, Emanuel, we together. &gt;&gt; Let's go, my friend. The Bible say in verse 32, and the children of Issacha, which were men of what? &gt;&gt; Understanding. &gt;&gt; Understanding of what? &gt;&gt; That's to know &gt;&gt; what Israel ought to do. So there is two ability in is in Isaka. The first ability they have a discernment of time. &gt;&gt; Lord discernment. &gt;&gt; Amen. Of time. &gt;&gt; And the second ability is what? &gt;&gt; Knowing what to do. [Laughter] &gt;&gt; Knowing what to do. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. Yes sir. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There is a difference between &gt;&gt; recognizing &gt;&gt; brother Brandham preach a message. &gt;&gt; Hearing &gt;&gt; what is the next one? Hearing. &gt;&gt; It's a title of a message. Hearing &gt;&gt; recognizing and what? &gt;&gt; Acting upon the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes, &gt;&gt; we must say if we sit here and we hear cling cling cling cling cling cling cling cling cling to this building what do we say it's telling you fire &gt;&gt; you know your alarm is set &gt;&gt; but what do you do &gt;&gt; because some people when they say the alarm is set they get hysteric and they hit the wall and they go over there they no no when the alarm is coming when the trumpet is sounding. &gt;&gt; We heard the trumpet. &gt;&gt; We know it's the trumpet of Jubilee. &gt;&gt; But what do you do with the trumpet of Jubilee? The one who knows what to do will take his uh whatever he's working on &gt;&gt; and drop it &gt;&gt; and look to the task master &gt;&gt; and say get your badge. &gt;&gt; Goodbye. &gt;&gt; I'm going. &gt;&gt; If not, you going to stay right there. not knowing what to do. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Issaka is a tribe that knows understand the time. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But Isaka doesn't stop in understanding the season. Isaka also move forward to know what to do with the season. &gt;&gt; In other words, now is the season to be blessed. Ah, &gt;&gt; I know that. So, if it's a season to be blessed, what should I do? &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; What should be my behavior? [Applause] &gt;&gt; How should I behave? &gt;&gt; Because if you don't know how to do, &gt;&gt; you are stuck. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? Are we together? &gt;&gt; If you hungry, &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. &gt;&gt; and you recognize where do you hungry? &gt;&gt; But if you don't know where food is, &gt;&gt; amen. &gt;&gt; But if you know that they told you that food is in a refrigerator, &gt;&gt; when hunger hit you, &gt;&gt; you first understand hunger, &gt;&gt; but you know what to do is to go to the refrigerator. &gt;&gt; Are we together? And the Bible say the tribe of Issachar is a tribe that understand the times, they understand the season and they know what Israel is supposed to do. &gt;&gt; In other words, when a prophecy happen, &gt;&gt; Isakia will look &gt;&gt; and say, "Okay, the Messiah have come." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's prepare ourselves. &gt;&gt; Are we together?

I know it's time to do, but &gt;&gt; what should we do now? &gt;&gt; So what do I do? &gt;&gt; You lack the knowledge to know what to do. The Bible say and they have understanding of the time come to know what what Israel ought to what &gt;&gt; ought to do. &gt;&gt; The heads of them were 200 and all the brethren were at the what &gt;&gt; commandment. &gt;&gt; If you notice if you go home and you read this chapter many tribe came they were bringing natural strength. &gt;&gt; They were coming men of war men of war. Men of war. When Issacha came, he didn't bring war, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; He lived peacefully. &gt;&gt; He's working with his his wisdom. He said, "David, we don't have any weapon. We have the supreme weapon. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Judah might bring you a sword. God might bring you a sword or or an arrow. But we we bring you the head. &gt;&gt; We bring you the head. We are bringing you the capstone &gt;&gt; and that one knows what to do &gt;&gt; because the head tell Elisha where the ambush is. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Even Israel fighting need intelligence. &gt;&gt; The intelligence is what prepare war &gt;&gt; and send the the the soldier on the ground and the soldier are going based on the intelligence. It is the intelligence telling you what to do. &gt;&gt; And the intelligence of Israel was coming from Issach. &gt;&gt; Man of intelligence, man of understanding that knew what time is, what season is and what to do in a particular season. &gt;&gt; In other words, they will tell you this is the season to crop &gt;&gt; for crop. This is what you do. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's man that knew how to succeed. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Let's go to the book of &gt;&gt; Esther.

Do you know this? &gt;&gt; And this feast the Bible say he made a I mean a I mean a feast to his princes &gt;&gt; and his servant.
