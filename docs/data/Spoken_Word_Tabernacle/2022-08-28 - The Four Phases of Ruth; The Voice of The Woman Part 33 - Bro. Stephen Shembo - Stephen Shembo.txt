back to school i know some of them already back to school but that will be on october the 1st i remember we did it last year so we will have the time here and when we finish we bring the kids here speak to them and pray for them as the going back to school amen so that will be october the first to the best of my understanding our next house meeting will be on september the 24th everybody heard me september the 24th it's already almost like less than a month so september the 24th remember that you can put it on your calendar and we move on with that amen brother michael oh mark lost his brother overseas but he's here this morning so you keep the family in prayer he will not be traveling but just a phone call or a visit or talk that will help amen so just remember the family in prayer he will not be going back for the funeral but he will be staying here amen blessed be the name of the lord sister rebecca's wedding shower went very very very very very well amen i want to thank everybody that participated i know some probably could not because of certain legitimate reason if it's not a legitimate that's between you and god but whoever was there i really thank you because it shows respect and it shows a consideration that we are together as a family and we support one another if you were trying to be there for a certain reason you could not the lord knows your heart but we thank you all for the support i know probably certain gifts might follow after for the people that didn't make it but thank you very much this is the way we want to be we want to be one we want to be united and this is the way we're going to be in heaven amen so this church is not an african church or an american church or a european church this is the church of the living god amen so when we have baby shower we do it for everybody amen whether you're not gonna get married again remember you need to support one another and especially the young folks remember to be there because i don't want you to complain on your time when somebody doesn't show up amen so make an effort if it's someone else put something aside and make sure you support one another amen blessed be the name of the lord every musician in this church i want you to stay for a few minutes after service i wanted to talk to you whether you play the organ the drum whatever you do in this church if you're a church worker you work on a computer or something i want you i want you to stay in here if you biking the song or whatever you do in a translation or on a computer you stay here i want to talk to you probably like 10 minutes or less to the most amen i want you i want everybody to be on the same page amen this is not something i'm not separated from the music the music is working together with me i am not separating from the computer the man on the computer is projecting slides so we gotta stay on the same spirit on the computer same spirit at the beacon same spirit in the trustee same spirit over there on the keyboard and backing up in other words we are in the very big battlefield amen if you think this is just something you come and play and you go home this is not the case you don't understand you can get you can get hurt quickly amen you don't know what i go through i have more fight than probably what you have for me to be standing here you don't know how many battle i'm going through amen i don't have time to disclose that to let you know because some of you can handle it but i know who called me and placed me here so that's why i'm moving amen but i want everybody to be on the same page we are under the same expectation and we know what we're doing so the next time i'm coming to you don't think it's something personal between me and you it is something that i'm trying to show you that you're not operating the way we are supposed to be amen and if you feel like you are struggling or something is going on something is going on in your life i would rather you sit down because you can get hurt and i'm trying the best to protect you hey man i don't want you to get hurt i know what i'm talking about amen there is no way we can unfold the devil like this and the devil being calm so don't think i'm the only one receiving the attack everybody that is participating in the service to make the service better just be on your guard because the devil either he's going to try me if he doesn't charge me he's going to search for someone else or go back and forth trying to see where he can disturb amen so we want you to stay spiritual amen if you're not spiritual you're not where you're supposed to be stay where you are don't get hurt here do you understand what i'm saying amen so i will be talking to you so we stay on the same page if you have any question to what i will be speaking do not ask anybody else do you get me come and ask me amen amen you hear me do not go ask a brother benjamin because he can give you his opinion that might not be true if you have any question come and ask me that's the way i want to operate in this church i really appreciate a brother who called me said brother stephen i have a question about this this this i know to which extent i can open up and make that brother understand and protect the privacy of somebody else everybody here but don't sit there and begin to assume and talk to this one and get into a click because you don't know because if you do that i'm expecting you to come to repent repentance is not being nice to somebody or giving him a gift that's not repentant you need to come back and say i did wrong and then i will help you up not to do that over again everybody okay so you have any question don't talk don't assume come and ask me say pastor i'm asking you why do you use a sharpie i will tell you why i use a sharpie everybody okay so don't sit there and say well but angel why is the pastor as you have i mean uh you using a sharpie and then he can give you his opinion i don't want that come and ask me so if i'm doing a movement in the church you don't understand come and talk to me so if you're a musician you're not here come and see me later whenever you come back to the church i need to talk to you we want to be on the same page and we're working together i'm consecrating you consecrating the musicians are consecrating the congregation is contributing those on the computer consecrating everybody is staying on their toe then we're going to win this battle everybody okay so far so we are good nothing adequate let's go to our scripture amen yeah the hour is very very bad and very late so if you got used to be playing church you cannot play church now amen yeah you cannot play church now i don't want you to get hurt i'm saying that over and over i don't want you to get hurt amen in other words we need to cut off some foolishness yeah those staying online playing on social media and something like that you can get hurt quickly you don't know when things comes back to me and they bring it to me with proof so be careful i don't want to get hurt amen that's the nature of what we're doing it's the father's business amen if you got your car insurance paid your tax is good your inspection is good and you keeping your speed limit you can be in this country 10 years without a ticket everybody okay if you don't want the cup to turn the lights on do what is right and the cap will never stop you but if you go in there you don't check your inspection and you're changing tag or you spitting on the highway definitely i would turn my blue light on we okay so if you don't want to face me do what is right genesis chapter two i usually tell my employee you're not my employee i'm just saying because somebody would say he thought we had no but i usually tell them at work i say as long as you do what i tell you to do we will never sit and talk we get you do your job i do my job we go home i don't need meetings meetings meetings meetings anytime it's i wasn't employed to i know how it is it's annoying everybody okay so i don't want meeting meeting meeting over there about the same thing over and over and over and over check your tag check your go get your inspection checked up and everything let's move on yeah not today at the court tomorrow at the court tomorrow at the court genesis chapter 2 verse 15 glory to god if you're there you can say amen sometimes the things we are we are holding on is very unnecessary and it keeps causing you trouble are you just stubborn about something that is unnecessary stop doing this you know listen stop doing this you're doing this and we keep talking about stop doing this it's nothing get it off and then we get off you it's okay [Music] and the lord god took the man and put him into the garden of eden to dress it and to keep it you might be seated i will see how far we can go you're there and the lord god commanded the man he didn't command the woman i want you to stay alert he didn't command a woman god is talking to adam he's not talking to eve anybody okay when i say the woman here i'm talking about eve but here she's not eve yet eve came later and he commanded the man saying of every tree of the garden you may freely eat amen but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil you shall not eat he didn't say touch there you remember you shall not eat of it for in the day that you eat thereof you shall surely die everybody okay so god gave his commandment to adam everybody okay this commandment was with god god open up and unfold that commandment and deliver it to adam now that commandment is no longer with god everybody okay it belongs to adam because what is now revealed belongs to god you know that deuteronomy 29 29 wants it to reveal he doesn't belong to god anymore amen it belongs to her it belongs to you that's the reason why when the book was open when the seal were broken god could not hold the book anymore because it doesn't belong to him anymore he already opened the book he doesn't belong to him he need now to return the book back to man are we okay are we okay are you still thinking about your meeting after service put the meeting put it outside okay stop thinking about what is the pastor about after service forget about it let's focus on this yes sir okay leave that meeting alone everybody okay so the word of god or the voice of god was given to adam and adam only everybody okay verse 18 and the lord god say it is not good that the man should be water you remember on wednesday i will make him a water a help meet for him in other words eve was not there that's what i want to point out he was giving only to adam not eve everybody okay so the word of god moved from god the word from christ amen into adam number one or zero it was god and number two the word move now it's an one who is adam we okay go to genesis chapter 3. you there you can say amen verse 1 and the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field which the lord god had made and he said to the woman not to eve everybody okay now the woman is already created she's pulled out from adam everybody okay he spoke to the woman he said to the woman yeah has god say you shall not eat of every tree of the garden amen and the woman said to the serpent we may eat of the fruit of the trees of of the garden trees plural but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden you remember that god has said you shall not eat who said did god speak to eve where did she learn it everybody okay god say amen if he's speaking like god told her [Music] [Music] i'm still reading the same bible if never say adam told me that god say no no no no no when adam speak it is god speaking [Music] are you okay when adam spoke he was god god told moses i'm gonna make you god did you see anybody worshiping moses [Music] amen god has said you shall not eat of it neither shall you what lest you do water did god speak to eve so the word somehow left adam everybody okay and went into the woman everybody care in the beginning adam was the voice of god are we okay are we okay in the beginning if you want to know what did god say you need to go to adam [Music] in other words adam at the beginning was god's mouth peace [Music] to his wife to the church because a woman is a church so adam was the most piece of god anybody care everybody okay but once adam delivered the word to evil everybody here if you become the mouthpiece of god [Music] everybody okay eve now is the peace of god amen eve is talking to the serpent like she was talking to god everybody okay so the voice was no longer with god he was now with eve so the voice moved from god to adam and from adam to eve everybody okay it's the order of god amen order of god easy amen you can take adam off it's no problem because adam already delivered the void anybody okay you can take brother branham off it's too late the message has been delivered [Music] all that you need to do is hold on to the message hold on to the word [Music] the message say eat everything except one tree amen so the message has one warning it was warning against the only bad thing that was in eden everybody okay everybody okay god didn't he give no more detail that's enough as long as you hold on to that message amen the evil that is in need and won't do anything if you just keep the word amen you will never touch off the tree of evil good and evil [Music] everybody okay god never told eve to worry about job or to worry about david amen god gave her a message for the present time for the evil of the present time [Music] for the present day evil [Music] message was not concerning cain he was concerning the tree because the devil became the truth of good and evil so god gave a specific message for the specific time to handle the devil in his specific [Music] aspect did job have to deal with the tree of the knowledge of good and evil so job message won't work there the message of david won't work there amen so in other words when god give a message god give a message related to the evil of the day it's a prescription that is specific for a certain german or a certain disease [Music] amen if it's a zitro you cannot use a multi-ceilin [Music] glory to god where am i at let's jump to verse 4 hallelujah amen and the serpent say to the woman you shall not surely die you remember this in question and answer and everything amen for god does know that in the day you eat thereof then your eyes shall be opened last of the eyes and you shall be as god knowing good and evil and when the woman saw the last of the eyes that the tree was good for food amen who made her see that he was good for food the serpent amen in other words the eve begin to leave the voice of god and she took another voice [Music] here so after the conversation between even the serpent if swap voices if swap messages anybody okay praise god that he was pleasant to the eyes and a tree to be desired to make one wise proud she took off the fruit thereof and she did what and gave also to stop who gave the word of god unto adam and who gave eve the word of god okay now we have two person here we have a man called the devil all of this i didn't plan on that they just coming up from your boss everybody here we have the devil of satan we call him also zero amen he gave his word we okay now is he complicated we can close here and go home he gave his word to the serpent anybody care now zero to one so the serpent becomes the mouthpiece of satan because the one who was speaking in the serpent was not the serpent he was the devil in the serpent that's why the bible said the old serpent which is the devil everybody okay everybody okay praise god now the devil into the serpent and the serpent took the voice of the devil and delivered to her [Music] amen so the woman become the mouthpiece of the devil [Music] here adam gave the woman the word of god or the voice of god but the woman gave adam the voice of the serpent everybody okay praise god let's go to verse 8 so she took it is eve who took yes this goes now to adam everybody okay if you notice we okay god didn't give his word to evil he delivered that to an agent right unto the angel not to you to the angel the angel knows what to do god never told adam when you will have a wife teacher he knows what to do with the world anybody okay anybody okay the devil also took his word and gave to his agent remember that's a president to president and this is vice president to vice president both of them are targeting the woman you remember the president in heaven all of these two are in heaven these two are on the earth in the garden amen president to president vice president to vice president everybody okay and then from this he gave to the woman and the woman gave to adam the devil didn't give adam the tree of life the tree of death [Music] what i'm trying for you to understand satan never dealt with adam you need to understand this to understand how the devil operates satan took his message delivered to the serpent and the serpent took the package scan it and verify everything and say this is going to greensboro and he turned it to the woman everybody okay and are we okay you don't know how to ship stuff it's in transit transit transit and you if you hit the tracking number it will tell you that the message is now with the serpent you need to have a tracking number then you look into things now you need to be careful because it's going to come to adam you need to know the tracking number the trail of the serpent the tracking of the serpent [Music] it is your boss who's talking not me amen everybody okay so the devil used the woman to give the to give the fruit to adam so if you check it doesn't look like it's the devil when you look at eve where did you get this eve the bucket the serpent where did you get this the serpent [Music] you see how many steps you have to go before you find who did it we okay job to verse uh we're on verse six and he did it and gave also to her husband with her and he did eat everybody okay job to verse 11 glory to god and he said this is god talking to adam who told you that you were naked who taught you the gospel that is not the word i gave you the word i gave you was do not eat where did you learn this new gospel of nakedness who taught you those stuff i didn't teach you at home where did you learn it so you must be messing around with someone anybody okay anybody okay now adam is gonna tell us where did he get it so let's see we know the origin is coming from the devil so normally adam should say the devil gave it to me let's see how adam is answering it's the same scripture over it's a layer we just peel the first with now i don't know which layer we are done amen verse 11 and he say who told you that you were naked have you eaten off the tree where if i commanded you that you should not eat watch verse 12 and the man say the devil who was in the god the who [Music] do you see the devil there are you okay now he said the woman whom you gave to be with me she is gave me of the tree and i did water now the eve that was giving the tree this woman is not this woman here [Music] everybody okay the body is still the same woman but their voices changes everybody here this one was virgin she was pure anybody here this one already ate the fruit with the serpent so this one is no more virgin amen she is no more pure anybody care so the woman that give the fruit to adam the fruit to adam is not a pure woman it is not a virgin woman it is a woman that have committed adultery we okay now that's the woman that give the voice to adam not this one because this one when you ask her she said the lord god said anybody okay but this one doesn't have anymore the lord god say what he comes he said adam i discovered something new that you never discovered before let me make you test of it we okay praise god we on verse uh 12 job to verse 13 the bible say and the lord god said to the woman what is this that you have done you see the trail we're tracking back amen and the woman said the serpent the woman didn't say the devil still the devil is undercover [Music] amen she said the the serpent amen the serpent began me and i did what that's where they stop god never asked the serpent a question he dealt with his children that was over hallelujah he doesn't worry about the serpent because he's a beast everybody okay job to verse 17 glory to god and adam said and to adam this is god he said because you have hearken to the voice of your stop the voice of eve the first time we heard eve speaking in the scripture eve was talking about the word of god evil saying the lord god said you can eat every tree except this tree you don't eat it you don't touch it that was the first time the woman's spoken about [Music] anybody here anybody okay but god is condemning adam for listening to the voice of the woman which voice [Music] everybody here so there is a voice here amen anybody care and there is also a voice here this voice was the word of god everybody this voice was the lie of the devil and back here and god was condemning this voice the voice of the woman anybody okay let's go to revelation chapter two glory to god if you dare you can say it man just stand tight i'm letting some airplane fly sooner we will be taking off amen revelation 2 verse 18 if you dare you can say amen to the angel of the church of water how many church churches do we have we have ephesus we have smyrna we have programmers you should be now memorizing this now and we have we have tartarian amen then we have sardis every young man should repeat this by memory if not i don't know where you are amen and we have philadelphia and we have water god is talking here everybody okay we have one two three one two three are we okay here start with paul amen and paul was afraid that the church is falling you remember that why because of the serpent everybody okay now one two three right in the middle in the midst [Music] i didn't say it somebody said it in the midst amen remember the candlestick look like a tree [Music] right the candlestick look like a tree in the middle everybody okay what happened in the middle of the church [Music] it's a good vitamin buddy he vaccinated you very good until you can take off your mask and talk to the devil [Music] you'd understand what i'm talking about to the angel of the church of tartarian these things say the son of god who has eyes like to the flame of fire watched down and his water they brought the feet here you remember their feet are like water why does he talk about the feet of fan bras here they are fit here like fan bras you remember in the middle are fine brass i know your work and charity and service and faith in your passion and your works and the last to be more than the first we okay now watch verse 20. notwithstanding i have a few things against you because you permit that [Music] everybody okay what's the name of the woman oh is jezebel a good woman what is she doing in the midst of the church [Music] i thought the church started pure because paul said as a chest virgin [Music] i want to present you to class as a virgin so paul left the church virgin something happened somewhere and we found another woman a woman a woman called who jezebel a good woman she's a bad woman what is jezebel doing because you permit the woman jezebel adam you permit ever anybody here which calls herself a water so it's a woman that can teach [Music] if you blank you don't know stuff she can teach you [Music] you remember proverb 9 you remember that woman the harlot in proverb seven you remember this woman is a prophetess she's a preacher woman where did she get her message we okay he says a prophetess which call herself a prophetess camera to the water and to the water so this woman teaches and seduces yes am i reading a different bible this woman teaches and she does water what did the devil do to eat first and do whatever [Music] the trail of the serpent body and but here if she teaches she have a voice so there is a voice here a man that can teach and seduce you anybody okay she can teach and say juice my so she's attacking who the people in the world she's attacking the who the woman is here was attacking her the son of god anybody okay well if you go quiet with me you can go back put marriage in divorce and you'll be clapping your hand you sister you'll be clapping your hand because at first you were afraid of marriage and divorce you say brother branham is speaking too harsh now when you go back you say oh my god now i see what brother brother was talking he was talking he was not talking about me wrong teaching hey buddy okay myself she's teaching my servant to commit water she's teaching sex am i reading a different bubble okay to commit fornication and to eat fake sacrifice to water i gave her a space to repent of her water and she repented behold i will cut her in a bed and damn da commit water if committed water so this woman is also an adulterous woman so she's a married woman you remember the you remember in proverbs 7 that woman telling the young men that my husband travel she was a married woman eve was a married woman this jezebel was a married woman we okay i mean 22. but to cast her in the bed that she committed and them that committed adultery with her into a great water so whoever is attached to this woman tribulation guarantee guarantee if you don't want to go in tribulation come out of here [Music] okay now we okay now praise god except the repent of the water look at the grace of god always coming even to cain remember on wednesday they gave cairns a grace to repent but there is nothing in cane to repent amen we okay but god must be judged and failed job to verse 23 and i will kill her will kill her water so this woman have children stop him i wish i had more space when eve gave adam the fruit did she have babies not at that time but she got pregnant later on eve produce a baby anybody here these women also have babies are we okay she has children but god want to kill those children what is wrong in those children [Music] amen and i will kill her i will kill her children with death and all the churches shall know that i am he which searches the rain and heart the mind and the heart and i will give to every one of you according to your water so these women have children but god is determined to destroy these children what is in these children that god want to destroy them everybody okay does a woman have the seed [Music] the seed is coming from who so which is the man that gave her those children who is the man that god is trying to destroy the children anybody here let me remind you again so we leave the airport brother branham says scripture does not play with words whatever is in the record is therefore the anointed eyes to water it's there for uh right here you already got your sermon let's pray heavenly father lord we are approaching you again humbly this morning father thanking you for your grace for your love your mercy and for everything you have been doing for us father we are committing this service unto the hand we thank you for your presence lord father may you move me completely out of the way may you come and speak to your children father be the alpha and the omega the beginning and the end of this service lord we commit everything unto the hand we seal the devil and his army away from this place in the name of jesus christ amen my subject this morning is the four phases of ruth the voice of the woman [Music] amen everybody okay the voice of the woman we touch this on surface in a hotel but let's see how deep we can get here in our subject with roof we are still in the trashing floor because roof is no longer under the candlestick she is now in the trashing floor where she got the word reveal with her with six measure of barley amen the light of the candlestick could not give her the sixth measure of barley it takes another oil into the threshing floor to unfold the six seals everybody okay and from there we connected with the with the parable of the 10th virgin where we are dealing not with the first oil of the candlestick of the lamp but we're dealing with the second oil that has been reserved over there in our tabernacle teaching we are very very very deep into the holiest how can the holiest be connected with the trail of the serpent because we were dealing with roof and we say in the holiest this is where you receive the holy ghost and we left that path and it seems like we went to the virgin we talk about the oil which is the holy spirit but we left that virgin and now we find ourselves talking about the beast amen what is the connection between the holiest and the beasts that we're talking about the beast at the beginning and the beast at the end amen when if was created when the woman was created in the garden of eden the woman was virgin anybody okay the woman was pure both adam and eve could look at each other and they were not ashamed in other words they never realized that they were naked anybody here in other words the conscience of sin i have the quote the conscience of nakedness was locked by god [Music] amen and the one who unlocked the conscience of sin to human being is evil amen amen everybody okay if by eating the fruit anybody care unlock the corner nature you can check that one amen that corner nature was not working at all he was there but he was locked by the holy veil of god amen so eve going and eating the fruit if actually unlock the sinful nature because what if did is did it by sex anybody okay that's why the bible says we were born and shared in iniquity amen coming into the world speaking water the reason why you are shaping iniquity because the way you came you came by sex it is the sex act that loads you with the carnal nature everybody here sin didn't start here everybody okay everybody okay that's why job say a man that is born of a woman is of water [Music] because the man is born of a woman it's a trouble about here and god is coming into the holiest to purge that karma nature to purge the snake to purge the snake to purge the serpent from your soul by the baptism of the holy ghost when the fire of god come he purges in removing the snake from both of you that's why for you to understand the baptism of the holy ghost why you need it you need to understand where sin started everybody okay so far as we move on into our subject this morning we were in the parable of the 10th virgin we found out that the women that left going to the uh uh to the husband or the bridegroom all of them were virgin everybody okay and five of them lost and five entered and the five the entire were also virgin anybody here so in the beginning we're dealing with virgin everybody okay at the end we're dealing with virgin the problem is what happened in between everybody okay because paul was afraid and paul was afraid because paul did everything that he can he said i am jealous over you with godly jealousy for why i have inspired you to one husband so paul was not the husband amen paul was the messenger of the husband everybody okay and paul say the reason why i'm jealous i want to present you as a chest water to christ who is the husband but paul said i feel less by any means as the not the snake anybody okay not the snake as the serpent began eve through water so the fear of power was deceptivity of the serpent anybody okay because we found out that the subunity is the software we okay it is the mind anybody okay it is the perverted wisdom amen that satan uses to destroy a virgin everybody okay the serpent use it to destroy eve jonathan used it to destroy temer everybody okay and the harlot in proverbs 7 use it to destroy the young man and the young man was also void of understanding he was a naive young man so subtlety is the software that the devil uses to destroy someone everybody okay once that that software is turned on everybody okay that software opened three gates are we okay the last of the eyes we okay the last of the flesh everybody care and the water brother branham say all of this were given in eden everybody here and we found out that when jesus came when the devil attacked jesus he opened the same software but you remember the quote brother branham said he uses three major assault on jesus christ the same as he did for israel because he told jesus if you be the son of god turn this what stone into a water because jesus was hungry the last of the flesh everybody okay he told jesus i'm going to show you all the kingdom everybody here if you look at all this kingdom if you worship me i'm going to give you all of them and he showed jesus every kingdom the last of the anybody okay he took jesus at the temple and told him you go there jump brother branham said he did it so everybody can see jesus jumping and not dying he took him by the pride of the life amen and the way jesus overcome everybody okay he never use any gift anybody okay jesus didn't use any kind of thing jesus just used the word and the word alone it is written it is written it is written showing that if you get if you stick with the word anybody okay there is nothing that the devil will do to you if eve would have stuck with the world nothing would have happened to eve everybody okay so far blessed be the name of the lord now brother branham says this that we have the beast at the beginning everybody okay clear here we have the beast at the beginning and we also have the beast at the end if you miss it i'm just catching you up at the beginning brother bottom say it's a serpent in the garden of eden amen as we follow his track his trail at the end brother branham said it is two things it is a religious man and also it is a denomination which is a woman a denomination which is a woman and this denomination makes also denomination israel everybody okay brother branham said the beast from the beginning he was the best at the garden of eden he's the beast at the end he shows that he is a religious person and a denomination that made their denomination and come right through the trail of it and the reason why we were going in the beginning we showed you on wednesday that god declared the end from the beginning [Music] amen so when god is talking at the beginning he's already telling you over there amen and for you to understand the end better you need to go back to the beginning and once you understand the beginning everything in the end will match up perfectly everybody okay why because god from ancient time the things that are not yet done my cancer shall stand and i will do my pleasure you go to marriage and divorce everything he does is for his pleasure everybody okay so far blessed be the name of your lord brother branham say that this great first battle that was ever thought begin in heaven everybody okay he began in heaven when michael and his angel fought against lucifer and his angel he first started the first battle was in heaven so sin did not originate on earth anybody care that's why when god created adam god came and gave him a protection because sin already started from heaven anybody okay sin originated not in heaven but sin did not originate on the earth it originated i'm sorry in heaven and then he was thrown down from heaven cast out of heaven to the water so whatever happened in heaven here between the bus between the president and the first president was transferred to the earth amen and in fair in the garden of eden that's the reason why ezekiel say that the devil was in the garden of eden you remember ezekiel 28 brother branham say when he was cast down he fell on human beings then the batter from angel became water and satan came to destroy god's creation what god has created to him to to be for himself he had set and come to destroy this that is what his purpose was was to destroy them then the battle begin here on earth and begin in us and has been raging ever since so when the brother left heaven he came on the earth god used adam the president of the earth and the devil is also the vice president of the earth you remember the devil so the battle began to rage right here everybody okay but we know that adam was locked everybody here the devil didn't have any soul and the only person that had sold was a woman ever here and the devil went through the woman and made her swap veil because the veil that is head that she can look through adam and doesn't see anything that veil was a holy veil [Music] eve could look at adam and doesn't have any lust and adam could look at eve and doesn't have any lust everybody okay so far but that veil was changed from a holy veil into a last veil amen he was changed from something holy into something that is filthy we noticed that the soul that the devil was looking is something that is very precious yes the bible says what is the man prophetic if he shall gain the water and lose his water so there is a possibility for you to gain everything and lose your soul you can even gain the whole world it's a possibility but you're gonna lose your soul that's why brother branham say just because they prosper that is where we make a mistake prosperity is no sign of spiritual blessing everybody okay that's right not a bit it is it prosperity sometimes is water if your prosperity is blocking you from defense of god your prosperity is not a blessing it's a curse you hear people i'm not going to church but i'm doing better in business i'm not going to church but i'm prospering everything is good the lord gave me a new job the lord gave me a new position but look at your position what is your politician in relationship to your spirituality if you are growing into the world but you are decreasing into your church your christian life you're going the wrong route amen i don't care how much you are accumulating i don't care how much you are buying i don't care how much you are prospering if your prosperity is keeping you aware from god away from the church away from the service away from question and answer away from a prayer life your prosperity is a hinduism [Music] everybody okay if you sleeping stand back there the bible said keep your heart with all water because out of it come the water in other words the course of your life is starting from your heart that's why your soul is purchased if you open your soul to anything you can get yourself in trouble amen the bible says in in uh john 3 john's chapter 1 beloved i wish above all things that you may do whatever everybody want to prosper anybody okay and be in water we want to prosper and we want to be in good health in other words i don't want to get sick but i want to make more money anybody care john say i wish that happened to you but how do i wish [Music] everybody okay anybody okay he said even as the soul do what so your prosperity naturally must be going with your spiritual life if you climbing naturally spiritually and your prosperity is climbing that is the correct prosperity but if your prosperity is bringing god down is making you miss service making you don't go to church stopping your prayer life attacking your prayer life your prosperity is wrong [Music] [Laughter] what do you try to accomplish in this world you want to be a big businessman you want to own all this big apartment there is nothing wrong with it climb up in your spiritual life and own as many apartments as you want own as many houses as you want own as many businesses as you want but make sure you can be higher if you're not climbing higher you actually selling your soul [Music] because i have people that don't come to church but they are prospering [Music] but the pentecostal understanding is prosperity means that god is with us if god doesn't bless me then i will understand i'm doing something wrong so if god is still blessing me i don't go to church so i don't need to go to church because i'm getting blessed because i'm getting my bill paid because i'm making more money you're going to find out what you're doing one day amen all it takes is one shot they can bring you down everybody everybody here in other words you don't look for god only when you get trouble [Applause] anybody here when you are sick that's the day we're gonna see you in church when things begin to collapse down that's when you come to church but as long as everything is going well you cannot go to church you are under curse [Music] you are selling your soul you are not valuing your soul you can gain everything and you want to find yourself in hell there are many rich people in hell the rich people that rejected jesus christ went to hell and when he rejected jesus he continued to prosper because prosperity is not a sign that god is with us [Music] anybody here everybody here you might find out that i have many trouble that's the reason why god is not with you no no sir watch your soul if your soul is still prospering know that your trial is just a test [Music] everybody okay everybody okay everybody okay glory to god brother branham said that she pulled off the holy veil to see what sexy really was compare that what last really will do she pulled the veil from both her eyes we are right here amen the holy things that god the holy thing that god has put over her eyes she wanted knowledge to know what it was all about so she pulled the veil off to see what it was all about she listened to the devil and noticed what a place he put her in now notice he perverted from innocency from a pure woman don't miss this now the church has been with this last veil on notice what is done to her it's perverted her from a nonsense to knowledge he moved if from innocency to knowledge everybody okay praise god she knows it's present see the holy veil she was innocent with the last veil she is knowledge over here she doesn't know anything over here now she's a phd everybody here she knows it's pleasant she knows what he does it's a fruit a tree to be desired making one wise she is perverted from the innocent to knowledge from holiness to fifth and last and from life to water brother branham is saying when eve moved from here into this one she's moving from holiness from innocency to knowledge not godly knowledge she's moving from holy to a filthy woman she's moving from life and to death everybody here so the woman that brought adam was a filthy woman a woman of knowledge a woman that become deaf because if when she ate the fruit death entered the eve but death was not inadequate death entered adam truism so if become a distributor of death a man born of a woman is offered everybody okay so far blessed be the name of the lord brother branham says this glory to god brother branham says this satan did it by the woman's lust for knowledge for sex which she chose by her own female agency now notice it was eve that led adam to the wrong i already showed you right here and it was the woman that took off her clothes before her adam took off his anybody care it is the older woman it's always been and still the water because we know that adam was locked wednesday the serpent was destroyed and changed completely so that satan cannot use him anymore locked but the woman is still available anybody care everybody here so the one who taught adam was a filthy woman she became an immoral woman she became an adulterous woman she become a woman filled with the knowledge of sex that is the weapon of the devil [Music] always been always will remain [Music] everybody okay everybody good so far everybody good so far so what are we talking about the mechanism here glory to god amen now let's put a chart here and let's see what happened in our chart let's start back again now number one we have satan everybody okay we call him the devil amen satan started that's the first thing everybody okay satan move into a creature i'm going slowly that creature is number two he's a beast everybody okay we call that beast the serpent anybody okay and from the serpent the beast will move into the third category which is a woman everybody okay now this woman is not just a woman it's an immoral woman anybody here and then from the woman we do it okay the woman eve produce two things everybody here number one this woman produces cane everybody okay he produces cane cane amen and cain is a religious man [Music] anybody here remember can worship amen and cain is a jealous man everybody here and cain is also a murderer everybody here and cain is also a liar anybody care and can at the beginning can start good but later on he will be rejected from the presence of god and he will have a mark put on him go search your scripture everybody care go search your scripture do you know that do you know that god put a mark on ken how many knows that praise god if you don't know you ask your neighbor he will show you everybody here so ken has a marker and this mark means that he is separated from the presence of god but here so now you have the mechanism of the devil [Applause] [Music] everybody cares so far everybody cares so far and ken was a man we okay but eve has daughters do you know that do you know that i don't want you said brother steven say do you know that eve his daughter how many knows open your bible amen you there go to genesis chapter 5 because i see someone watching me like this so in other words i'm lost you there genesis chapter 5 job to verse 4. if you dare you can say amen everybody okay and the days of who after he had father i'm good on time so relax okay the days of adam after he had further set where 800 years and he father and water one how many many daughters and one of that daughter was the wife of cain am i reading a different scripture no let's go because i see the way go to genesis 4. maybe i need to give you my bible so you can scan it and verify this message is perfectly in line with the bible this message is nothing but the bible [Music] that's why we believe the message that's why we believe brother branham [Music] a message believer should be in love with his bible because the bible is a new book anybody care to verse 16. and cain let me see something okay go to verse 15. so whoever was struggling i'm going to give it to you and the lord said to him therefore whosoever slay came vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold and the lord set a water okay any any question so from now on you know crying have a mark but that mark was not to stay in the presence of god he was living from the presence of god with a mark we okay can has and he set a mark upon king lest any funding him should kill him verse 16 and cain went out from the presence of the lord and dwell in the land of lord on the east of eden and ken knew his water where did you get this wife the first woman was evil and the other women that came in were the daughters of eve who gave ken a wife [Music] we okay we okay so not only did eve produce cain but eve also produce a wife a daughter this daughter is the wife of cain the wife of cain amen amen am i reading a different bible the first from adam adam was number one the seventh one was who we already went through that the whole church should shout the first was adam the seven was who the first was kane do you know the seven from ken lemak do you know what he did the first polygamist and do you know what happened to enoch he went into the rapture so the seventh from adam goes to the rapture [Music] the seven from adam is manifesting the end time bran [Music] and the seven from ken is manifesting polygamy and scientific people do you know that let me kill somebody also do you know that let's go to the bible job to verse 23 and lamech say to his water the first time the first human polygamist [Music] why didn't adam become polygamists anybody care i ada and zilla hear my voice you wives of lamech how can tuma speak for i have slain a man to my wounding and a young man to my hurt let me drop this because your boss reminded me everybody care we okay when is change from a good woman to an adulteress or an immoral a filthy woman with a filthy last everybody here polygamy was introduced go listen to marriage and divorce let me leave it there we will come back everybody okay first he said verse 23 listen to me you heart uh your wife of uh lamech who can do my speech for i have slain a water a man to my wounding and a young man to ma just like cane kill and if cain you see that shall be avenged sevenfold truly lamech seventy and sevenfold he took seven times eleven because the eleven is this number of the eleven worker hours [Music] we will get to number 11 down the road everybody okay everybody okay so far so the mechanism here of the devil follow me carefully start from himself anybody okay and he moved to a beast amen and the beast will use a woman that is immoral and from the woman that is immoral he will produce a can and it will produce a daughter did i lose anybody did i lose anybody where are you trying to go with this in genesis chapter 16 [Music] verse one keep your seat belt buddy okay stay up stay up in genesis chapter 16 the bible say now sorry abram wife how do you call him sarah s a r a i how many letters do we have she was the wife of who not abraham [Music] sarah was not the wife of abraham she was the wife of who how many letters do we have why both of them have father we okay now can i continue now sarah abraham's wife bear him no children and she had a handmaid an egyptian whose name was who so in this family that was living peacefully without a problem we found that there was a man called abram married to sarah amen but in between them in this ludutani family in this little garden [Music] are we okay are we okay there was another woman called hagar amen so in this little garden there was also another woman with five ladies can i say that again in this little family god and brother robert there was another tree [Music] are we okay there was another tree in this garden this tree was called hagar it's a woman a tree [Music] brother branham say from a little standpoint now to prove to you that she was the tree every woman is a fruit tree how many knows that aren't you the fruit of your mother certainly you are and in the midst of the fruit of the in the midst of the tree the fruit that she not touched in psalm 127 you need more scripture you seize me you see me the bible says children are an heritage of the lord and the fruit of the water does a man have a womb whoever womba so the woman have a fruit and the woman is a tree and this tree here was an egyptian tree everybody here and hagar was both good and a danger are we okay are we good hagar could be good and evil everybody okay as a servant she was a handmaid she was a female servant anybody care but she could be a potential for to be a concubine to abraham to abraham are we okay lord help me the bible say sorry say unto abram behold now the lord has restrained me from bearing i pray thee go in unto my maid and it may be that i may obtain children by water god gave abram the promise he said i will give you a son and your son will come through your wife sarah everybody here that was the word of god everybody okay but sarah have another voice [Music] everybody okay and that voice was contrary was contrary to who he was contrary to the word of god so we found out that cere had a voice everybody okay and the voice of cere was a voice that was contrary to god and the bible says this that an abram hearkened to the water of who was that the voice of god so somehow sarah was perverted somehow the devil already worked with cere everybody here and sarah brought a gospel to abraham to deviate abraham from the promise of god and the promise sarah brought was to give abraham another wife to give abraham another tree that was not given to abraham are you following me abraham was giving cere she was not giving her girl but sarah is the one who taught abraham everybody okay to eat off the tree of heaven are we okay who gave adam the tree anybody okay who gave hagar abram let's see the scripture and sarah's abraham wife did what [Music] are we okay am i reading the bible verify your bible everybody here abraham never went and said hey god come here [Music] sharon we've had perverted teaching took hagar you come here one two one two one two are we okay are we okay she took edgar and made the water after abram has dwelt 10 years in the land of ken kennen and did water who gave she took and did what who gave the fruit to adam everybody okay and gave her to her husband who gave abram the fruit let's go to genesis because some of you are still watching me go to genesis chapter 3. job 2 verse 6 job 2 verse 6 if you're there you can say amen and when the woman saw that the tree was good for food so sarah determined that hagar is good for food she's also a woman she can bear children sarah look and say hey wait a minute i'm troubling myself for nothing waiting on the promises of god this is a woman she looks good she's young she's still fertile the fruit the tree look good for food everybody okay the serpent seed in adam in abraham ever here the serpent seed in abraham he said hey it look good you know what and it's good for fruit everybody here and that he was pleasant to the eyes of sarah amen and the tree to be desired she's a woman yeah she's a woman she can do what a woman can do to abraham everybody okay to make one water she took off the fruit over there look at the word in the scripture scripture don't play with words remember what i told you she did water took who everybody okay let's go back to the scripture now she took off the fruit and did it and did what gave to her to her who looked at the scripture here and gave to her water the tree that was good as a good tree for a maiden now the tree become a target so hagar was a tree of good and evil sitting into the house of abraham ever here and abraham was living with that tree without any problem and the devil entered the house of abraham and went to sarah and disturbed the man of sarah and sarah took the tree and gave to abram and abram eight of the fruit [Music] what is the product that is coming from there where oh my god let's slow down let's slow down let's slow down you want to go home you want to go home can i continue ken was a man that was animal and human [Music] mixed together the product of adultery produces a man that is animal and human let's see the product of abraham and echo what is he producing everybody okay anybody okay verse 11 and the angel of the lord said unto her behold they are with a child and shall bear water not a woman not a woman the first baby is always a son the first baby that comes from the devil is always a son it's always a man not a woman the woman will come after always a man and that man will be animal and human together he will have a savage nature a beastly nature an animalistic nature we okay we okay let's see what comes out there and then you will bear a son and shall call his name so the product of hagar hegar produced ishmael i continue again number one who the devil into who the beast into who the woman produces and produces water everybody okay now let's look at that he said he shall call his name ishmael because the lord has heard that affliction and he will be a water why ishmael come out to his wild man why he didn't become a good boy a wild man savage why the tree is wrong the tree is wrong everybody here you remember here the son of eve introduced water the fall of air of sarah introduced polygamy to abraham now abraham have two wives [Music] polygamy is wrong [Applause] in the house of abraham who introduced polygamy in the world [Music] can i continue can i continue he says a wild man his head will be a guest and every man against how can a man be like that wow ever here who did that surrey if you notice in the name there what is that highlighting red can i continue can i continue on the process of time so the voice of cere produce ishmael a wild child the voice of the woman produces cain a wild man the voice of the woman can i continue can i continue now in the process of time we are in genesis 21 can i continue are we okay the bible says and sarah look how it's written verify in your bible where is the icon where now we're talking about sarah is this the i it's the same person let me continue sarah saw the son of who ishmael the egyptian which he had born unto mocking ishmael was not born from abraham he was born from abram wherefore she said unto who there is also a changed name in abraham if you look at abraham abraham this remains five but the letter changed but this one moved from five to seven are we okay they added h and a this one they added h and they removed the i they swap here but this they didn't swap anything because abraham did not did not doubt the problem was coming from sarah not abraham anybody okay now abraham and she said to abraham who's speaking to abraham so now it's not the voice of cereal it is the voice of sarah the voice of the woman now we found out that sarah have also a voice yes sarah had a voice which was contrary to the word but sarah have a voice let's see the voice of sarah can i continue the bible says he says to abraham cast out this bond woman take the tree off [Music] and not only the tree even the fruit that came from the tree sarah use the celery use the tree and produces ismael but sarah cannot tolerate neither the mother nor the child why because isaac the promised son is in trouble can i continue and sarah sarah said to abraham cast out this bond woman and her son for the disney for the son of this bond woman i thought i thought she was a handmaid i thought she looked cute to be with abraham now she's no longer cute she's a bound woman anybody here shall not be what with my son even with who right isaac okay and the thing was very grievous in abraham's side that called him off guard because of his water and god said unto whom let it not be grievous in that sight because of the lord or because of the woman or of that bondwoman in all that who has said do what unto what [Music] so sarah had a voice can i continue god never backed the voice of cere [Music] god never supported devils but when sarah spoke god came and backed that voice and say abraham i am behind this voice [Music] everybody here everybody here in other words i have anointed sarah to say what you say everybody here because what sarah is saying will both remove heger and remove ishmael [Music] it's a different gift buddy you go home you sit and go meditate upon this everybody here galatians chapter 4 job to verse 22. let's look at the words of sarah the apostle paul comes and pick up sarah what is apostle paul saying verse 22 where am i at god help me let me hurry i can't get where i'm trying to let me hurry everybody okay for it is written that abraham had two sons the one by a bond made and the other by a water so sarah is a free woman we okay now but he who was of the bond woman ishmael was born after the water the desire of the flesh it was wrong but he of the through women three women was born by water so sarah her voice is fleshly anybody here but sarah her voice is a voice of promise everybody here because god reminded that for inaudible sarah is correct what she's saying is line up with my word that's why you must listen to her voice so it was not the voice of sarah he was the voice of god in sarah [Music] everybody okay praise god job two verse 24 which things are an allegory a type for these are two water a double covenant you remember marriage and verse there are two covenants the one from monsanto the law which tender to bondage which is aegon for this egger is monsanta in arabia an answer to jerusalem which is now and is in bondage with her children everybody okay but jerusalem which is what is what so sarah is the jerusalem that is above we know that jerusalem is the brother everybody okay we know that jerusalem is the bread you remember sarah is the bread so the bride have a voice [Music] everybody okay so sarah is a bride [Music] can we continue can we continue he says jerusalem which is above is water and is the water of water sarah is the mother of us all remember that sarah the bride is the mother of as water she's the mother of everybody everybody okay for it is written rejoice you baron sarah that bear for the desolate has many more water than she which bear which then she which has her water and now we breathe them isaac was are the children of water we are asked anybody okay verse 29 but watch carefully ishmael but as then he that was born after the flesh persecuted everybody here the child that was born out of sarah is a persecutor [Music] a murderer a man he's persecuted him that was born after the water so sarah give children by spirit everybody okay even so it is now nevertheless what says the scripture paul is coding now sarah cast out the water and her water for the son of the bound woman shall not be here with the son of the water so sarah was prophesying [Music] amen anybody here so sarah is a woman that has a prophetic voice because paul used that verse 31 and so then present we are not children of the bondwoman but of the water watch chapter five verse one stand first therefore in the water which with with well with christ has made us water and be not entangled again with the yoke of water god already freed you he freed your way in sarah go to genesis chapter 17. amen i'm going to hurry now let's go to genesis chapter 17 i thought i'm going to get to the end my god let's go to genesis chapter 17. if you're there you can say amen anybody care verse 5 if you dare you can say amen neither shall your name because we have a problem we found that the name of sarah was changed to sarah we found out that the name of abram was changed to abraham everybody okay and this sarah is a woman with a prophetic voice serene introduced ishmael and introduced hagar but serra is kicking ismail and his kicking is removing the destruction is removing sin from the home of abraham everybody okay verse 5 neither shall your name anymore be called who but your name shall be called water for a father of water shall my father of many nations have a water so abraham means water [Music] everybody here job to verse 15 and god said to abraham as for cere your wife you shall not call her name siree but shall her name be and i will bless her and give you a son also of her yea i will bless her and she shall be the water mother of water mother of water abraham was the father of water and i and aaron and sarah is mother of water sarah is mother of water so when they change abraham to a father of nation sarah become mothers of nation they both received the same name ever here they both are received the same name one is just a female version and another one is a male version but both of them become one name [Music] everybody here remember in the beginning both eve and adam was one name both of them were adam eve was only the female version of adam and adam was the firm the male version of adam everybody okay everybody okay now we have abraham and sarah father of nation mother of nation they have one name compared to nation one is a male version another one is a female version now the two names are won [Music] everybody okay everybody okay everybody okay if you notice in sarah they changed from an eye to a nh we okay can i raise this when you look at your alphabet we have letter a we have letter b can i continue we have letter c we have a d we have e we have f we have g we have h we have i cannot stop there okay you know the remaining a is the first letter b is number everybody okay sarah have the letter i which is number what is number nine are we okay brother branham tell me a little bit number nine brother branham say the night was not divided in ours in the bible time it was divided in watches there were three watches now the first watch started from nine until twelve the second watch started from twelve to three and the third watch of the night was counted from three to water now we got three three trees which is what a water everybody okay so sarah had an imperfection and her voice produces ishmael a one child anybody care and god remove her imperfection and insert eight which is the number of water [Music] everybody okay everybody okay now they turn eternal life eternal life internalized eternal life the godly part of god the imperfection is removed and they took the new breath and they inserted into sarah when sarah speaks she's speaking prophecy [Music] are we okay are we okay are we okay and then abraham god added water and what his name is number one and where is number one everybody here everybody okay everybody okay brother branham say the earth day there is only but we speak of the water which is a water do not do work in water the eighth day back to the water [Music] can i continue the gentle calendar is a horizontal calendar we start monday tuesday wednesday thursday friday saturday and water then we start again monday tuesday that's the way the calendar goes the jewish calendar is a circle calendar we okay the jewish goes like monday tuesday wednesday thursday everybody okay friday saturday and sunday hey you start here one and then and then and then and then and then and then the sabbath of the jews then when you come back here you have number one and eight are they sealing the circle bringing you back to eternity [Applause] everybody okay anybody okay anybody okay so we found out that in abraham god put the beginning and he put letter a and he put also i he's sealing the circle with seven letters from five to seven per ever completion and the completion is closing the circle [Music] everybody okay everybody okay everybody good everybody good so now cere produces ishmael a word chad but he take a prophetic anointing of this era where eternity has been logging to both of them and they became one mother of nation and father of nation carrying the same name in order to destroy hagar and ishmael that's why you need the baptism of the holy ghost if you want to get your ishmael off your life you want to take ahead of your life you need the connection to number eight you need the baptism of the holy ghost to remove ishmael to remove the carnal nature the wild nature from your home [Music] everybody okay everybody okay brother branham said the son of the bound woman will distress the son of the free woman until the son of the bond woman will be water that let us know that they they hatred and the blasphemy of satan against the true christian will be vented through a group who are nominal false christian can and this will increase until god uproot the false vine at the end of water because abraham becomes seven church natural and church water and the bible say cast out the water and her hagar for she will not be here with the free woman and her the natural church that is going to inherit what the binding of the shift the banding of the band to be burned and she will not inherit with the we be here with the free woman if the bond woman is in bondage with her water children she would not be here with the free woman because the free woman's children is going in there and the bones woman children is gonna stand in there that's why they need to do water by the spiritual awata we are off the spiritual women and because we are of the spiritual woman now we have a voice and we know that the voice of sarah is the voice of the bride that's why brother branham said that when methodists fail god raised up other and so he has gone through the age through the years until in this water there is again another in the water who under the water will be the farmer tell the farmer the church is no longer the mouthpiece of god it is his own water so god is turning to sarah he will confront her through the prophet abraham h i have seven letters when the water our abraham is brahma with seven letters with h.a inside with the blood for the voice will be in water why because he says the spirit and the blood say water and we are the final forces to the families and under our final messenger to take care of ishmael and to take care of hedger let's stand my friend glory to god the voice of the woman the voice of the woman we got perverted voices perverted voices but there is a true bad at the end time that's going to bring the true voice of god because she will be the founder voice everybody okay so far the voice of a woman the voice of the woman everybody okay so keep in mind if you need to take a screenshot remember satan is moving from satan to the beast from the beast to the woman from the woman to can from cain to a daughter this is at the beginning later on we will go in the end and see how this works everybody okay we are the final voice that's why h.a.m have to come at the end amen amen 8 a.m at the end time on the 7th ever here because the ham coming at the 7 has a meaning it is telling you that we are dealing with a different letter now god has come down he's going to take care of that carnal child that cannot charge and a woman everybody here everybody here that's why the second oil take care of hagar and take care of ishmael everybody okay let's pray heavenly father lord we are approaching you again humbly this morning father thanking you for your grace for your love and your mercy and for everything you have been doing for us father the more we are progressing the clear now we can see that even in numerology in a letter in the alphabet everything was pointing to this age all the perversion that started in eden father are going to be done away in this age no on the paul could look and say that you could not come until a falling away come down and the man of sin be revealed at the end he knew that the revelation of the man of sin will unfold a different anointing father that would take care of our carnal nature and remove completely their beastly nature until one of this day our body will be changing our molecule will be changing and death that is still raining in our body will no longer have a grip in our life because by the baptism of the holy spirit you are approaching the inward man but by the rapture father you are taking care of the body to bring lord father to with the complete redemption of the body and now we're gonna be like you and never to fall again father may you help the church grasp what you're trying to say may you help lord father your children understand that it's a different level it's a different church of the holy spirit you are coming to finish the plan of redemption to finish everything to rescue men completely back again in eden so that we can enter into the millennium and be able to perform that which adam was not able to perform because since adam till now no man have ever lived for a thousand years old now you are rebuilding adam father you took preeminence in christ and you are taking preeminence into abroad because the blood will be the final voice so that you are restoring back eden and we can go back into the millennium to get into the rest of the day father we thank you and we're committing your children unto their hand lord may you strengthen them and may as they go throughout the weak lord may you give them more clear revelation and understanding of the word that will suck them into their prayer into their presence and further that they can see lord that they're so worth more than anything what profit of a man that he can gain anything and lose his own soul father what profited us in this world where everything is going to chaos and the rapture is imminent lord father may your children understand the value of the soul may they invest in the soul because you spoke in your word that seek refers the kingdom of god and everything shall be given unto thee may we sit first that kingdom may we worry first about the soul and father you will take care of the rest because those things will be added unto us father we committed and ask it in the name of jesus christ amen continue to keep your head down as we pray brother say uh brother sam come and pray with me by the police [Music] she's having fun [Music] do [Music] do [Music] so [Music] do [Music] do [Music] do [Music] leave and i will come back and change [Music] [Music] worship you oh my soul [Music] my
