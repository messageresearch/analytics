[23:37] minute
[23:39] drive I'm
[23:41] driving the door wide open in the back

[23:53] bad accident so I just want to thank God
[23:55] for that looks like you on theob
[24:02] amen okay one more one more okay
[24:07] am I'm like our brother and sister I I
[24:10] just can't contain it and it's not
[24:13] really a testimony of mine to give but
[24:16] I've been holding it for two
[24:19] weeks I know you have heard me give the
[24:22] the the prayer request for Elijah in
[24:25] school but the devil's really been
[24:28] attacking
[24:30] him yet for him to be 12 and I'm sorry I
[24:33] don't mean to get emotional but he has
[24:36] pushed
[24:37] through at his age of 12 when the devil
[24:41] has beat him in his
[24:43] mind told him he couldn't do it beat him
[24:47] down by teachers staff at school that's
[24:50] hard to fight through for a 12 year old
[24:53] and his parents and his siblings tell
[24:55] him you can do it the ministry he is
[24:57] standing on
[25:00] and I've seen our son pray for hours for
[25:05] a breakthrough for himself so God could
[25:07] make himself real unto him he took him
[25:11] at his word and the Lord answered
[25:14] him he studied a week and a half I mean
[25:18] coming in late from school staying up
[25:21] for two hours doing his chores still
[25:24] prayed about it and Elijah made a be on
[25:28] his math test that's his
[25:42] testimony so it's a prayer request and
[25:45] it's a praise report because I give the
[25:47] Lord all glory and honor for that as a
[25:50] parent but keep him in prayer because he
[25:54] stands on this word at school kids at
[25:57] school have
[25:58] issues at home they have ailments they
[26:01] have sicknesses they find Elijah and the
[26:04] devil doesn't like it so y'all keep him
[26:07] in prayer
[26:14] please okay y'all need to write these
[26:16] things down so I can read them it's
[26:18] taking a while I'm sorry I'm so sorry

[50:35] simple key but I believe it's the time
[50:37] for you to have it sometime you might
[50:40] not understand why I'm going to give you
[50:42] this but this will help you the rest of
[50:45] your life here on Earth until you meet
[50:47] the Lord in the air amen and if you use
[50:50] this wisely you will see every scripture
[50:54] every scripture will be unlock look in a
[50:57] way that you never even thought before
[51:00] amen am very simple key I just want to
[51:04] share with it amen so please give me
[51:06] some time I told brother Robert this
[51:08] morning I say the sermon I was supposed
[51:10] to preach last Sunday it's push for next
[51:14] Sunday because there is something else
[51:17] that came in the middle that open up I
[51:19] can't jump into it without going through
[51:22] this amen so you pray for me we need
[51:24] some time but let me share with you this
[51:26] key very simple but powerful if you know
[51:29] how to use it brother Bram says this I
[51:33] have this for a while but I felt like
[51:35] it's the time to go ahead and deliver
[51:37] this brother Bram say that
[51:40] therefore if there is any
[51:44] contradiction that anyone will think
[51:47] that the
[51:48] scriptures contradict each other that's
[51:52] an error
[51:54] amen amen amen amen why is this because
[51:59] when you read the Bible you will see
[52:02] something in one
[52:04] spot that will look like it's
[52:07] contradicting something
[52:09] else amen before you begin to
[52:14] think before you even ask a question
[52:18] just remember one thing there is no
[52:22] contradiction I know what I'm
[52:24] saying are we together are we together
[52:28] like I said God was the one creating
[52:32] when he create he say it is good when he
[52:35] create he say it is good when he create
[52:37] he say it is good then God turn around
[52:41] and say it is not
[52:43] good for men to be alone who created men
[52:48] alone God how did he create something
[52:51] that was not good
[52:53] [Music]
[52:56] amen
[52:58] amen I heard you here under the
[53:00] anointing so let's move on my friend I
[53:03] already heard you here so you can't go
[53:05] left and right I already heard you amen
[53:07] I saw you everybody enjoying and
[53:09] everything so I know you are anointed
[53:11] now how can God create something that he
[53:16] himself say it is not
[53:19] good you see now you see now so where
[53:23] you see contradiction in the Bible it is
[53:28] usually where a strong Revelation is
[53:32] hidden
[53:34] amen let me repeat it again I'm I'm I'm
[53:37] I'm helping you the rest of your life if
[53:39] you reading the Bible and you see
[53:42] something contradicting somewhere just
[53:44] know there is a big diamond that is
[53:48] laying right there and God doesn't want
[53:52] anybody to get access to it only the we
[54:00] destinated let's go back again praise
[54:03] the Lord Brother Bram say there is no
[54:06] scripture contradict a scripture and I'm
[54:10] going to drive this
[54:13] home this principle applies to the
[54:17] message of brother
[54:18] BR
[54:22] amen if you see one coat contr
[54:27] and there is no
[54:30] [Applause]
[54:32] contradiction it tells you there is
[54:34] something you need to study
[54:37] more you just about to miss something
[54:40] very
[54:44] big you say brother
[54:47] stepen this is the Bible this is the
[54:50] message in this church the message and
[54:54] the Bible are one
[54:57] why
[55:00] one why when they challenge brother Bram
[55:04] on brother about his message brother
[55:08] Bram pick up the
[55:11] Bible and put it on a puit and call
[55:16] preachers and say take the Bible and
[55:19] disprove my message in other word the
[55:22] Bible will never contradict the message
[55:27] [Applause]
[55:28] the Bible is the foundation of the
[55:31] message the message and the Bible are
[55:35] one and the message explain the Bible
[55:39] better than your eyes and your
[55:42] [Applause]
[55:47] brain so never be
[55:50] ashamed sir to talk about the message
[55:54] because the message came from the Bible
[55:57] the problem is preacher did not know
[56:00] this and because they don't have the
[56:02] answer now they begin to remove the
[56:05] message to try to hold on the church in
[56:07] the Bible when the message came from the
[56:11] Bible and when you remove the message
[56:13] you remove the
[56:16] [Applause]
[56:19] blood are we together amen are we
[56:22] together I'm moving the airplane my
[56:24] friend I'm online soon going to take off
[56:27] we together amen praise God brother
[56:30] brandham say the
[56:32] contradiction is where that maybe it
[56:35] contradict our
[56:38] way of looking at but it doesn't
[56:42] contradict what itself so if you find a
[56:45] contradiction just know it's your
[56:49] brain If you say wait a minute this one
[56:51] looks like it's contradict just know
[56:53] that it's your way you missing some
[56:56] glass
[57:00] [Applause]
[57:03] what an anointing in this place he say I
[57:07] have been in the ministry going on what
[57:10] 26 years now now I have
[57:13] never one time found one thing in the
[57:17] Bible that contradict anything else was
[57:21] written where in the Bible just know it
[57:24] is not there
[57:27] [Applause]
[57:27] [Music]
[57:30] are we together the contradiction is in
[57:33] our
[57:34] brain not in God brother brandham says
[57:38] this glory to God he says there is your
[57:42] contradiction looks like it now if you
[57:45] are reading with a corner
[57:48] mind brother Tony and not an open heart
[57:53] it shall be a
[57:59] [Music]
[58:00] contradiction Corner mind in other word
[58:03] when you reading the Bible you looks
[58:05] like a contradiction just know your
[58:07] Coral mind is activated that's right
[58:09] turn the coral mind off amen and open
[58:12] the heart amen and say Lord I know your
[58:15] word doesn't contradict itself that's
[58:17] right when you begin to approach like
[58:18] that God say that's my son over there
[58:21] open up amen this is what was laying
[58:24] there that's right are we together amen
[58:26] brother Bram say but if you shall read
[58:28] it with what openminded the Holy Spirit
[58:32] has heed this has he this from the eyes
[58:35] of the wise and prudent Jesus say so and
[58:38] thank God for it amen for what for
[58:41] hiding it and has revealed it to who B
[58:46] such as will what learn if you got a
[58:48] mind and not a selfish man but a willing
[58:53] heart to do what learn the Holy Ghost
[58:56] will teach you these what
[58:58] things remember the rest of your life no
[59:03] contradiction in the Bible no
[59:05] contradiction in the message of the hour
[59:08] and when it seems like there is a
[59:11] contradiction usually there is a big
[59:14] Revelation that is laying right there
[59:18] and God does not want the seed of the
[59:20] devil to pick it up because if the seed
[59:24] of the devil pick it up
[59:26] they can do great damage only the
[59:29] predestinated seed can pick it up
[59:32] because it's for
[59:34] you are we together are we together so

[1:24:24] last Sunday the Bible says according to
[1:24:26] first Thessalonians 5 verse 17 he say
[1:24:30] pray what without ceasing
[1:24:34] Hallelujah pray how without
[1:24:37] ceasing in other word prayer is
[1:24:44] unlimited you cannot pray
[1:24:49] enough that's why brother Bram says that
[1:24:53] still let us bow our head again if you
[1:24:56] will friend you may laugh how too much
[1:25:00] you may talk how too much you may walk
[1:25:03] out too much but you shall never pray
[1:25:06] what too
[1:25:08] [Applause]
[1:25:10] much prayer is 24
[1:25:14] hours if you work third shift prayer is
[1:25:17] open if you work first shift prayer is
[1:25:20] open if you work second shift prayer is
[1:25:23] open so whenever ever you wake up prayer
[1:25:25] is always open it's a 24 hours Western
[1:25:31] Union
[1:25:33] Amen brother Bram say God Longs for what
[1:25:39] he
[1:25:39] yearns he want people to do what speak
[1:25:43] with him to do what talk with him this
[1:25:45] is God who wanted you must sing too
[1:25:48] mucho much or you might preach too much
[1:25:53] sometime I'm reading brother Brandon
[1:25:56] sometime but there is one thing you
[1:25:59] shall never be able to what overdo that
[1:26:02] is what pray I would that man pray where
[1:26:06] everywhere doing what lifting up holy
[1:26:08] hands you shall never be able to have
[1:26:11] too much fellowship with God so prayer
[1:26:14] is a
[1:26:15] fellowship and God's long for his
[1:26:18] creature uh-huh who he has created in
[1:26:21] His image to do what fellowship with him
[1:26:24] pray without what ceasing are we
[1:26:27] together then in verse 18 I'm almost

[1:28:11] Pastor brother brandham says this he
[1:28:15] says I do not I don't try
[1:28:18] to I do not try to to say too much about
[1:28:23] it on you know around people that are
[1:28:27] doing what
[1:28:28] [Music]
[1:28:28] [Applause]
[1:28:35] complaining ah glory to God because I
[1:28:40] think one of the
[1:28:43] horriblest things is to see a or a who
[1:28:48] woman that is constantly
[1:28:52] complaining amen
[1:28:55] because the scripture give you no
[1:28:58] room to complain no room to worry you
[1:29:02] got prayer you got supplication you got
[1:29:05] Thanksgiving no
[1:29:11] [Music]
[1:29:12] room brother I'm saying it is one of the
[1:29:16] horriblest things is to see a man or who
[1:29:21] a woman that is how constantly complain
[1:29:30] you know nowadays with the economy with
[1:29:33] what is going on they shutting down
[1:29:34] people they shutting our job you know
[1:29:36] what is going
[1:29:39] on ah ah you are running my battery
[1:29:43] [Applause]
[1:29:45] low I don't care who is in the
[1:29:50] power because there is somebody above
[1:29:53] that man
[1:29:57] put whoever you want to that's not the
[1:29:59] problem God control the heart of the
[1:30:03] [Applause]
[1:30:07] [Laughter]
[1:30:10] Kings brother BR I'm say I have always
[1:30:14] thought God keep me from
[1:30:18] it from complaining too much he say that
[1:30:22] does what we
[1:30:24] [Applause]
[1:30:31] fath just know from today every time you
[1:30:35] complain you are weakening your
[1:30:38] [Applause]
[1:30:42] faith you are weakening your strength
[1:30:45] and the Bible say do not complain take
[1:30:48] your complaint turn it into a request
[1:30:52] because God does not heal
[1:30:56] Sinners that one we know it but the
[1:30:59] Bible says in First Peter 3 that for the
[1:31:02] eyes of the Lord are over who the
[1:31:05] righteous and his what ears are what
[1:31:08] open unto their
[1:31:10] prayers the ears of the Lord are open
[1:31:13] unto who the righteous the prayer of who
[1:31:16] the righteous so instead of complaining
[1:31:19] instead of worry God is always 24 hours
[1:31:23] ready to up ready not one here both of
[1:31:27] them in other word your sh your
[1:31:30] receiving station is always open you can

[1:31:46] receiver Oh Glory to God but the face of
[1:31:50] the Lord is against them that do what
[1:31:52] evil do we do evil no so what's the
[1:31:58] problem glory to God the Bible says in
[1:32:01] second chronicles 7 verse4 If my
[1:32:05] people which are called by who my name
[1:32:09] which is the
[1:32:11] BR amen shall do what humble themselves

[1:35:00] check in his own way we clear my friend
[1:35:04] amen we clear my friend amen oh the
[1:35:07] Bible says in James five confess your
[1:35:10] fault one to another and pray one for
[1:35:13] another that he may be healed the
[1:35:20] [Applause]
[1:35:21] affection effectual what fervent prayer
[1:35:25] brother RAM used the word
[1:35:27] desperate fervent prayer of who a
[1:35:29] righteous man do what ath much Eliah was
[1:35:34] a man subject to like passion as what we
[1:35:38] are in other words Elijah was no
[1:35:40] different than
[1:35:42] you you think God answer Elijah because
[1:35:45] he was super super James is saying no he
[1:35:49] was just like you don't worry my friend
[1:35:52] I'm going to get
[1:35:54] amen he says he was a man just like you

[1:36:15] Earth under the blood of bulls and
[1:36:19] goat one man controlling the Earth amen
[1:36:25] and then by a space of what 3 years and
[1:36:27] 6 months and he pray again and the
[1:36:31] heaven did what gave rain and the Earth
[1:36:33] did what brought forth her fruit it
[1:36:35] looks like the the remote control of the
[1:36:40] Earth was in the hand of
[1:36:43] Elijah so if Elijah goes pin
[1:36:47] nor and then when it's time Elijah goes
[1:36:50] again and say in and reain that's why

[1:45:23] it is not written maybe Jesus get in the
[1:45:25] water it's not written all of that it's
[1:45:28] not written so that's no longer my

[2:18:57] determine your
[2:18:59] prayer the vision of your life brothera
[2:19:03] has a
[2:19:05] time are we together are we together

[2:19:19] there that time is God's time follow me

[2:19:29] this time it is God's
[2:19:34] time that he sets right for the vision
[2:19:38] right it is God who sets this time amen
[2:19:42] amen I'm going to go through a simple
[2:19:45] example now the Bible say though
[2:19:53] God is
[2:19:59] eternal when he met
[2:20:02] Moses he said I
[2:20:07] am he didn't say I
[2:20:12] was he's always there when he came he
[2:20:16] was born we say hey we saw his daddy and
[2:20:19] mommy we saw how he was growing we saw
[2:20:22] you at 10 years I remember when you were
[2:20:24] playing here we saw you at 20 years old
[2:20:27] and one day Jesus stood he said I
[2:20:31] am they said
[2:20:34] ah you were born
[2:20:40] here your mother were coming to Walmart
[2:20:43] getting
[2:20:44] diapers for
[2:20:46] you today because you grow
[2:20:49] up because you start preaching the
[2:20:53] gospel because you became a pastor you
[2:20:56] begin to say I
[2:20:58] [Applause]
[2:20:58] [Music]
[2:21:01] am they didn't understand his
[2:21:04] language that is's always ever the am
[2:21:09] was the one that was inside Jesus amen
[2:21:13] the one that was with Moses in the
[2:21:16] burning bush that's the I am
[2:21:22] are we together if I lost you you raise
[2:21:25] your hand are we together my are we
[2:21:28] together am are we together amen so when
[2:21:31] we say don't it
[2:21:34] ter it ter to
[2:21:37] who us it to who to us because God is
[2:21:41] always there he doesn't
[2:21:44] sleep he doesn't Slumber he's a creature
[2:21:47] of
[2:21:48] Eternity what is yesterday
[2:21:51] because the Bible say one day for him is
[2:21:54] what So when you say 1,00 years Jesus
[2:21:57] Christ he say oh one
[2:21:59] day you're talking about one day you say
[2:22:02] no no no Jesus it's a thousand years
[2:22:04] Jesus say yes it's one
[2:22:07] day so even his way of counting time is
[2:22:13] different are we together so this St
[2:22:17] here is our time
[2:22:22] are we together
[2:22:24] though means even though it's taking
[2:22:30] time amen even though he
[2:22:36] lingers amen this is our

[2:22:55] [Applause]
[2:22:57] time are we together are we together
[2:23:00] amen are we together it will not t not
[2:23:03] according to you because to you it's
[2:23:05] already teing but to God he will not ter
[2:23:09] it means he will not be late
[2:23:12] [Applause]

[2:36:23] the seron amen listen to brother Bram
[2:36:26] listen to this the Bible say in Jeremiah
[2:36:30] for I
[2:36:35] know Lord help me I know what the
[2:36:39] thoughts the thoughts I do what that I
[2:36:41] think toward you thought who say that
[2:36:44] sayith the Lord thought of how of peace
[2:36:47] and what not of evil and to give you
[2:36:50] what end an expected
[2:36:53] end so his project is already
[2:36:58] guaranteed his touch toward you is for a
[2:37:02] good
[2:37:06] end he said I know the thoughts I know
[2:37:11] you don't

[2:38:16] happy Isaiah 55: 8 he say for my
[2:38:21] thoughts are not what your thoughts
[2:38:24] neither are your ways what my ways let
[2:38:28] me read this
[2:38:29] again let's go read it again for my
[2:38:33] thoughts are not your thoughts my what
[2:38:36] ways are not your
[2:38:40] ways it depends on where we are his
[2:38:43] thoughts or your thoughts his thoughts
[2:38:46] are different than yours amen amen am
[2:38:49] your prayer he already heard
[2:38:52] it hearing your prayer is not a problem
[2:38:55] the problem that the devil attack is the
[2:38:58] answering the shipping is okay but God
[2:39:01] shipping
[2:39:03] back it's where the devil is there right
[2:39:07] that's right he says for my thoughts are
[2:39:10] what not your thoughts and what neither
[2:39:12] are your ways my ways says who the Lord
[2:39:15] for us the what Heavens are what higher
[2:39:18] than the earth so what my ways toward
[2:39:21] what higher than your ways and my
[2:39:23] thoughts what than your thoughts in
[2:39:24] other word me and you we are so far
[2:39:29] apart that until there is an explosion
[2:39:33] that when you will understand what I was
[2:39:36] thinking about you when I say no you
[2:39:40] didn't know what I saw I saw the
[2:39:42] [Applause]
[2:39:46] exposion but you saw the temporary
[2:39:49] juice thing you looking for amen that's
[2:39:53] it are we together listen to brother
[2:39:56] Bram I'm heading to the airport my
[2:39:58] friend brother Bram say now the reason
[2:40:01] that Moses had forgot about what Freedom
[2:40:05] God's promise that he would do what
[2:40:09] freedom but God had not forgot his
[2:40:13] promise Moses
[2:40:16] tried yes how in himself and did what
[2:40:20] and
[2:40:23] failed I tried I fail so God didn't
[2:40:27] answer
[2:40:28] me that's not it I triy and he did what
[2:40:33] failed that is what the church has done
[2:40:36] how many times many times that's right
[2:40:40] and we come with a conclusion that
[2:40:42] prayer don't
[2:40:45] work the prayer did not work because of
[2:40:50] your
[2:40:51] time your prayer was going to 5 years
[2:40:55] and you say God didn't answer my prayer
[2:40:59] your answer is here God already heard
[2:41:02] you from the
[2:41:04] beginning because Daniel was praying in
[2:41:09] Babylon but it took 21 days it's written
[2:41:14] in your Bible for the to come and when
[2:41:17] the angel came he said Daniel from the
[2:41:19] beginning when you just pray I already
[2:41:22] heard you but you got to go through 21
[2:41:26] days before you get the answer your time
[2:41:30] versus God
[2:41:33] time my point is when you send prayer it
[2:41:37] is
[2:41:40] received the problem is time and when
[2:41:43] it's not according to your time you call
[2:41:45] that no but God didn't say no you one
[2:41:49] that says no it is not for you but the
[2:41:53] nose of
[2:41:55] God
[2:41:58] hallelujah are you together are better
[2:42:02] than his yeses the nose of God is 10
[2:42:07] years your yes is five a five you going
[2:42:11] to go
[2:42:15] work here everything will work beautiful
[2:42:21] Lord help me he says but God had not
[2:42:25] forgotten his promis amen Moses tried in
[2:42:28] himself and did what and failed that is
