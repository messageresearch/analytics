[24:47] all right praise the name of the lord
[24:51] genesis chapter 13 verse 8
[24:54] and abraham say to lord we know that
[24:58] abraham
[24:58] and lord came up from the hand from the
[25:01] land of the caudills
[25:02] they both were idol worshiper
[25:06] and god spoke to abraham but when god
[25:09] spoke to abraham he didn't only pull
[25:11] abraham out remember he also pulled out
[25:16] last sunday we talked about ruth and
[25:18] orpah when the family of elimelech went
[25:21] to moab
[25:22] he pulled ruth and orpah
[25:25] so for some time they're going to stay
[25:27] together as a family
[25:29] but the world come in time of separation
[25:33] amen all right so and abraham said to
[25:37] lord
[25:38] let there be no strength i pray you
[25:40] between me and you
[25:42] you might be seated and between my
[25:45] hearts man
[25:46] and your hurts man for we be brethren
[25:50] in other words there is a family
[25:52] relationship there
[25:53] but after a while because of the
[25:56] decision the oncoming decision
[25:58] something is going to happen and if it
[26:01] happened
[26:02] it's going to bring a split
[26:05] are you there where's the name of the
[26:08] lord
[26:08] that split is not caused by you remember
[26:11] on sunday
[26:12] it is caused by the word praise the name
[26:15] of the lord
[26:16] verse nine is not the whole land before
[26:19] you
[26:20] separate yourself a separation i pray
[26:24] you
[26:24] from me if you will take the left hand
[26:27] then i will go to the right or if you
[26:30] depart to the right then i will go to
[26:32] the left
[26:33] and lord lift up his eyes and be held on
[26:35] the plane
[26:36] of jordan that he was well watered
[26:39] everywhere before the lord destroyed
[26:42] sodom
[26:43] and gomorrah so lord look at this
[26:46] but behind this beauty behind this
[26:49] prosperity
[26:50] behind that there was a destruction
[26:53] coming up
[26:55] he never caught the destruction he only
[26:58] cut or saw whatever was appealing to his
[27:02] eyes amen before the lord destroys sodom
[27:06] and gomorrah
[27:07] even as the garden of the lord it looks
[27:09] like the garden of eden
[27:11] what a deception like the land of
[27:14] egypt we will talk about that land a
[27:17] little bit today
[27:18] as you come to zoar then lord choose him
[27:22] all the plain of jordan
[27:24] and lord surgeon east and they
[27:27] separated themselves the one from the
[27:30] other
[27:31] at the beginning it was a family but a
[27:35] stand have to be taken
[27:37] but once you take a stand it brings a
[27:39] split
[27:41] praise the name of the lord abraham
[27:44] dwell in the land of canaan
[27:46] that's verse 12 and lord dwell in the
[27:48] cities of the plain
[27:50] and pitch his tent toward sodom is back
[27:54] again
[27:54] over there but the men of sodom were
[27:57] wicked
[27:59] and sinners before the lord exceedingly
[28:02] never realized that
[28:04] and the lord said to abraham after
[28:07] not before after that
[28:11] lot was separated from him after the
[28:15] separation
[28:16] the lord appeared to abraham
[28:19] are you there so there was a part or a
[28:22] revelation
[28:24] that god wanted to show to abraham but
[28:27] he could not afford that revelation
[28:30] until the split happened are you there
[28:33] once the split the separation happened
[28:36] then the lord opened up the door a
[28:39] separation
[28:40] amen after that lot was separated from
[28:44] him
[28:45] lift up now your eyes and look from the
[28:48] place where you are
[28:50] northward and southward and eastward
[28:54] and westward in other words the word
[28:57] unfolded
[28:58] completely open are you there at the
[29:01] beginning god
[29:02] never give him that opportunity to see
[29:05] on the north on the south on the
[29:07] on the east and on the west abraham only
[29:10] have a certain
[29:12] limitation in his vision but after
[29:15] the split happened then the lord opened
[29:18] up a different door
[29:19] are you there in other words abraham now
[29:22] it's your time
[29:23] to investigate the land and there is no
[29:26] restriction to the investigation
[29:28] you have the right to go to the north
[29:31] you have the right to go to the south
[29:32] you have the right to go everywhere and
[29:35] protect to the land of canaan
[29:37] everybody clear let's go to philippians
[29:40] 3. we mentioned this on
[29:44] uh sunday but did not dig into it
[29:48] for time for the robert you need to help
[29:51] me on time because this thing is loaded
[29:57] philippians chapter 3 i thought i'm
[30:00] gonna do
[30:00] a little bit of short and before you
[30:02] know it something unfold and unfold and
[30:04] i'm folding unfold
[30:07] you got it philippians chapter 3 verse
[30:11] 13
[30:13] present i can't not myself to help
[30:15] apprehended
[30:16] there's still a work to do but this one
[30:19] thing i do
[30:20] forgetting those things which are behind
[30:23] remember
[30:24] oppa wants oprah and root split
[30:27] ruth have to move to the land of judah
[30:30] forgetting everything that is behind
[30:33] everybody there and which are behind and
[30:36] reaching for for those things which are
[30:38] before
[30:40] so just like abraham there were certain
[30:42] things that were before him
[30:45] but they were not unveiled until a split
[30:48] happened
[30:49] are you there so paul is saying that
[30:52] there are things that
[30:53] are laying before but we need to move on
[30:57] and forget that which was behind
[31:00] everybody clear verse 14
[31:04] i pressed toward the mark for the high
[31:07] for the price of high calling of cross
[31:09] of god
[31:10] in christ jesus so what paul is saying
[31:13] that the things that i'm pressing toward
[31:16] there is a price there and the price of
[31:19] a high calling
[31:21] in other words paul was called but there
[31:23] was still
[31:24] a high calling somewhere roof was called
[31:28] but there was a higher calling to roof
[31:31] not in the land of moab but in the land
[31:34] of judah
[31:36] everybody clear verse 17 brethren
[31:41] be followers together of me that's why
[31:44] we follow brother branham
[31:46] are you there uh-huh because paul said
[31:48] follow me
[31:49] as a follower christ we are following
[31:52] brother branham because what
[31:54] i'm following christ are you there
[31:57] follow me and mark
[32:00] them which work so as you have
[32:04] as you have so
[32:07] as you have asked for an example verse
[32:10] 18
[32:11] for many work so when paul is saying
[32:14] forget those things which are behind
[32:17] there was a
[32:18] there were a group of people many walk
[32:21] remember on sunday
[32:22] there were many disciples but in john 6
[32:25] 66
[32:26] some did no longer work are you there
[32:29] and paul is saying here that for many
[32:31] work
[32:33] of whom i have told you often and now
[32:35] tell you even whipping
[32:37] that they are the enemies of the cross
[32:40] of christ
[32:41] so at the beginning they were friends
[32:44] at the beginning they were brothers but
[32:46] after a while
[32:47] a split happened and when a split
[32:50] happened
[32:51] they turned to be enemy of the cross
[32:54] enemy of the atonement
[32:58] hebrews chapter 6 then we're going to
[33:02] pray
[33:04] praise the name of the lord
[33:08] was supposed to get into the part of
[33:10] serving but there is something we need
[33:12] to touch up
[33:13] hebrew chapter six verse one you need to
[33:16] keep your bible today
[33:21] if you dare you can say amen therefore
[33:24] leaving the principles
[33:26] of the doctrine of what you need to
[33:29] leave
[33:30] moab
[33:33] you need to go to the land of judah
[33:35] because there is a fresh bread
[33:37] in the land of judah remember on sunday
[33:39] ruth have to worship god no more immoral
[33:43] you need to depart for more leave the
[33:46] principle of the doctrine of christ
[33:49] let us go on to water so perfection was
[33:52] before
[33:53] a high calling perfection not laying
[33:57] again the foundation of what
[33:59] repentance from dead works that happened
[34:03] when roof was joined
[34:05] into the family of judah but we're now
[34:08] going back again there a split happened
[34:11] now you got to move forward to all
[34:13] perfection
[34:15] and of faith toward who god let's pray
[34:19] heavenly father
[34:21] lord we thank you again for your grace
[34:22] your love your mercy and for giving us
[34:24] an opportunity
[34:26] father through this pandemic that we can
[34:28] gather together
[34:29] lord iran the revealed word of the hour
[34:32] lord i have done what every man in the
[34:35] planet of earth can do lord
[34:37] but lord downfall then give revelation
[34:39] your prophet told us
[34:41] that it's a work of the spirit father
[34:43] may you move me completely out of the
[34:45] way lord
[34:46] may you take this service lord for your
[34:48] own preeminence lord
[34:50] speak to your children and may the holy
[34:52] spirit the inside teacher
[34:54] may he comes down and unfold the word to
[34:57] your children
[34:58] be the alpha and the omega lord we
[35:00] rebuke every demonic power
[35:02] lord father of fear of coronavirus
[35:05] all kind of stuff lord for the
[35:07] destruction in the mind of your people
[35:10] we rebuke it all back to hell lord in
[35:12] the name of jesus christ
[35:14] may you be with us and guide us lord in
[35:17] jesus precious name
[35:18] amen and amen god which they bless you
[35:22] it's a wednesday so it's going to be
[35:24] like a sunday school
[35:26] this we are dealing with the mystery of
[35:28] the two stave
[35:30] part four three was on sunday
[35:34] on part one we found out that when the
[35:36] ark
[35:37] of the covenant was made the ark of the
[35:40] covenant have
[35:42] two states that were put one on the
[35:44] right
[35:45] and one on the left side because
[35:47] technically the ark of the covenant was
[35:50] supposed to be moving
[35:52] but god never put wills but he used the
[35:54] will of
[35:55] man in order to carry the gospel and
[35:58] when we look on zechariah chapter 11 we
[36:01] found out that the bible spoke of two
[36:03] staves
[36:04] and when we broke it down and unfolded
[36:07] we found out that the first step
[36:09] means christ and if you remember when
[36:12] those steps were placed
[36:14] into the ark of the covenant a
[36:17] commandment was given
[36:19] not to remove those things in other
[36:22] words you can
[36:23] no longer take the step out of the ark
[36:26] of the covenant
[36:27] in other words the staff and the ark of
[36:29] the covenant
[36:30] are always connected together
[36:33] if you move if you want to deal with the
[36:36] ark of the covenant
[36:37] you don't touch the ark of the covenant
[36:39] but you handle the ark by the stairs
[36:42] if you move the steps to the right the
[36:44] arc move to the right
[36:46] if you move the stair if you move the
[36:48] staff to the left
[36:49] the arc move with the staff so you must
[36:52] know who are those staff
[36:54] and you need to be connected as a will
[36:57] to the staff
[36:58] and then you can be able to manipulate
[37:01] the ark of the covenant
[37:03] but the key point is those states have
[37:06] to remain
[37:07] always with the ark of the covenant
[37:10] in other words jesus christ is the word
[37:15] and jesus will never deviate
[37:18] from the word because the staff and the
[37:21] ark of the covenant
[37:23] are always connected or joined together
[37:26] everybody clear then on part two
[37:29] when we study part two we were trying to
[37:32] unveil
[37:33] the second stuff and we found out that
[37:35] the second staff was also crushed
[37:38] but now he was crushed in the entire
[37:41] ministry
[37:42] as the message of the hour are you there
[37:46] and then that's the reason why the
[37:48] message
[37:49] have never deviated from the bible
[37:53] because the ark and the staff are
[37:56] always connected and if you want to
[37:59] manipulate the word
[38:01] if you want to manipulate the bible you
[38:04] need to manipulate it
[38:05] by the stuff you need to hold the
[38:08] message of the hour
[38:10] in order to manipulate the word in order
[38:13] to preach the word of god
[38:15] you must preach the word by the message
[38:18] because christ is preached according to
[38:21] the revelation
[38:22] of the mystery everybody clear now
[38:25] those join the two head of the zodiac we
[38:28] spoke about it
[38:30] the first coming of jesus christ and
[38:32] also the second coming of jesus christ
[38:35] which are the two pyramids now we found
[38:38] out that
[38:38] uh zechariah told us that the first
[38:41] staff
[38:42] was broken and when he was broken
[38:45] he spoke about the crucifixion of jesus
[38:47] christ
[38:48] we're clear on that then we also found
[38:51] out that the second stuff was also
[38:53] broken but the bible says which was
[38:56] speaking about
[38:58] the second crucifixion of jesus christ
[39:01] under the ministry of malachi 4 and then
[39:04] we found out that
[39:06] the bible says that when the second
[39:08] staff was broken
[39:09] what did he do he broke the brotherhood
[39:13] between judah and israel it causes a
[39:16] split of the kingdom
[39:18] then on part three we try to understand
[39:21] what was that split now today when we
[39:24] were
[39:24] going to the end of part three we are
[39:27] sharing in with
[39:28] ruth naomi and
[39:31] oppa are you there then we found out
[39:34] that
[39:35] oppa and ruth both of them were joined
[39:38] into the family of judah
[39:39] are you there because brother branham
[39:41] said the way naomi
[39:43] left the land of israel going to the
[39:45] land of moab
[39:47] was a tap of the word or the gospel
[39:51] leaving the jews going into the
[39:54] gentile and when he went into magenta
[39:57] he pulled two vine we have the fourth
[40:00] vine
[40:01] and the truvine and we found out that a
[40:04] decision
[40:05] have to be made after all whether you're
[40:08] gonna serve god
[40:09] in the land of moab or you need to
[40:11] deport from the land of muslim
[40:13] and move forward into the land of judah
[40:17] so when the decision was taken he
[40:19] brought a split
[40:22] he brought a separation between the two
[40:25] women
[40:25] so going back again to the division of
[40:28] the kingdom
[40:29] we found out that the division of israel
[40:32] brought a split between the house of
[40:35] david
[40:36] and the remaining of the house of israel
[40:39] and we found out that under jeroboam
[40:42] ten tribes were given to israel and one
[40:45] tribe was given to the land of judah
[40:48] and judah represented the brand and then
[40:51] the tenth brother branham said
[40:52] then was when the tribe were karma in
[40:55] other words when the split happened
[40:58] it only removed the carnal part away
[41:01] from the blood when the split happened
[41:04] it only removed not away from abraham
[41:08] when the split happened he only removed
[41:11] opera away from roof
[41:13] are you there but we found out that
[41:16] there was a mystery tribe
[41:18] which was the tribe of benjamin so with
[41:21] these
[41:21] three in places here israel represents
[41:25] oppa
[41:25] which was the one the corner going back
[41:28] to the word
[41:29] judah represent the roof which was the
[41:31] brand and now only brother pranam
[41:33] explained to us was
[41:35] the top of 144 000
[41:38] which is the top of benjamin are you
[41:41] there
[41:42] so when naomi's going back to the
[41:44] promised land
[41:45] we see also that ruth is connected to
[41:48] naomi
[41:48] and going back to the promised land
[41:51] everybody clear so far
[41:52] now we get on part four tonight looking
[41:55] at those
[41:56] two brother branham said that
[41:59] one of the greatest if you want to see
[42:02] what time of the year it is
[42:04] look on the calendar if you want to see
[42:07] what time of night it is
[42:08] look at the clock if you want to see
[42:11] what day you are living in
[42:13] look where the jews are that is god's
[42:16] time
[42:17] peace if you remember the way the tribe
[42:20] were
[42:21] uh seated on on uh around the tabernacle
[42:25] and the movement of the tribe was
[42:27] clockwise
[42:28] like a clock in other words the movement
[42:31] of the jews
[42:32] gives you the time peace the time of god
[42:34] everybody care
[42:36] now on 2 21 brother branham say and look
[42:39] the very night the very day
[42:42] that the angel of the lord met me
[42:46] 1946 on may the 7th
[42:49] at greensmill indiana that same
[42:53] day the treaty of peace was signed for
[42:57] the jews
[42:58] and they were established they were an
[43:01] established nation
[43:02] for the first time for 2 500 years
[43:06] so brian branham is connecting here that
[43:08] the day he was commissioned by the angel
[43:11] of the lord
[43:12] it happened to be exactly the same day
[43:15] that israel was recognized as a nation
[43:18] why because when naomi is going back to
[43:22] the promised land
[43:23] roof also is connected to her as
[43:27] israel is going back to the promised
[43:29] land to receive her atonement
[43:31] a bride must be introduced together at
[43:35] the same
[43:35] day everybody clear praise the name of
[43:38] the lord brother branham continue here
[43:41] on question and answer
[43:42] he said because the roman empire took
[43:45] them over
[43:46] and the messiah come and they rejected
[43:49] it because the first staff
[43:50] have to be broken everybody clear and
[43:53] was gathered to the four wings of the
[43:55] earth
[43:55] we met we we already studied that that
[43:58] the jews were scattered all over the
[43:59] world
[44:00] so the trumpet have to sound in order to
[44:02] bring them back to the promised land
[44:05] but did you know on may the 6th again
[44:09] 1946 that flag come back over jerusalem
[44:12] again
[44:13] did you know on may the 7th 1946
[44:16] the angel of the lord appeared to me the
[44:19] next day up here
[44:21] and send me into all the world to bring
[44:23] forth a what
[44:26] remember rules have to go back to the
[44:28] promised land because of what
[44:30] a revival the very next morning
[44:33] when that flag raised in jerusalem as
[44:36] the going down of the sun that afternoon
[44:39] the angel of the lord or the angel of
[44:42] the lord
[44:42] appear here in the what the united
[44:45] states remember your fifth elijah i have
[44:47] to be in america
[44:48] we already taught you on that one in the
[44:50] united states
[44:51] at the same time when you see the fig
[44:54] tree and the rest of the tree is putting
[44:56] forth birth
[44:57] then you know that what the time is a
[44:59] hand everybody clear
[45:01] so if you look at naomi and benjamin
[45:04] as a benjamin when the gospel left
[45:07] jerusalem because the family of
[45:09] elimelech means
[45:10] pleasant worship when the gospel left
[45:14] the land of
[45:15] bethlehem jerusalem going into the land
[45:18] of moab
[45:19] the family the move out was the family
[45:22] of judah
[45:23] and judah always tempered with gentiles
[45:26] are you there
[45:27] and brother branham told us that naomi
[45:30] was the top of
[45:32] 144 000
[45:35] and we know that a hundred and forty
[45:36] four thousand was a type
[45:38] of benjamin and we know now that when
[45:41] you look at the gospel
[45:43] when the gospel was leaving israel
[45:46] going to the gentile brother branham
[45:49] explained to us that
[45:50] the lion anointing that came upon paul
[45:54] was the anointing that was on jesus
[45:57] christ
[45:58] it was the anointing on the ministry of
[46:00] jesus christ as
[46:01] alpha that was poured down in the house
[46:04] or in the life of paul
[46:06] because judah always spoke of a
[46:09] lion but when the lion left
[46:12] the child we left israel when that
[46:15] anointing left
[46:16] israel and came down on the day of
[46:19] pentecost
[46:19] in order to usher the gospel to all the
[46:22] gentiles
[46:23] we found out that there was a man by the
[46:26] name of paul that appeal
[46:29] check roman chapter 11.
[46:36] if you dare you can say amen romans
[46:39] 11. let's look at paul a lottery
[46:47] brother robert pass me the ball on this
[46:49] one
[46:52] everybody there romans chapter 11 verse
[46:55] one i say then
[46:57] has god cast away his people god forbid
[47:01] for i who's speaking poem
[47:05] for i also am a what
[47:08] an israelite an israelite of the seed of
[47:11] what
[47:12] and of the tribe of what why paul had to
[47:16] come out after the tribe of benjamin
[47:22] why is the gospel living in israel
[47:25] have to use the tribe of benjamin
[47:29] is it clear are you there that's why
[47:33] when judah was living there because
[47:35] judah
[47:36] always have a connection with benjamin
[47:40] are you there when joseph want to reveal
[47:43] himself in egypt
[47:45] he wanted to see benjamin but his father
[47:48] didn't want to let benjamin go reuben
[47:51] pleaded
[47:52] and then the father refused but when
[47:54] judah stepped on the scene
[47:56] and asked for the pled judah was granted
[47:59] to take benjamin
[48:01] back to the gentile that's why when the
[48:04] anointing of
[48:05] judah is leaving israel he had to
[48:09] drop by the tribe of benjamin
[48:12] and pick up a benjamite by the name of
[48:16] paul jump to verse 13.
[48:23] you can get this without a prophet
[48:28] for i speak to you gentile inasmuch as i
[48:32] am an apostle of what
[48:34] so that apostle of the gentile have to
[48:38] come out from what
[48:39] from the tribe of benjamin take
[48:42] philippians chapter 3
[48:45] praise the name of the lord
[48:48] if you dare you can say amen philippians
[48:52] 3 verse 5
[48:55] paul says this he said paul
[48:58] he's talking about himself he said
[49:01] circumcised the what
[49:03] a day of the stock of israel
[49:07] of the tribe of water benjamin
[49:10] clear a hebrew of the hebrews as
[49:13] touching the law
[49:14] a what a pharisee clear and if you check
[49:17] again galatians you'll find that
[49:19] it is clear that peter was an apostle to
[49:22] the jews
[49:23] but paul was an apostle to the gentile
[49:26] everybody clear that was the first phase
[49:29] of ruth
[49:30] living there god of naomi leaving the
[49:33] land
[49:34] and coming out to the gentile now the
[49:36] second phase
[49:37] was for naomi to leave the land of the
[49:40] gentile
[49:41] and go back again to israel why because
[49:45] they heard
[49:46] news that there was bread in the house
[49:49] of
[49:49] israel but particularly in bethlehem
[49:53] where brother branham say it was the
[49:55] center of bread
[49:56] everybody clear now brother muslim says
[49:59] here
[50:00] that i am now christian don't do that a
[50:03] christian
[50:04] don't try to be what he used to be
[50:07] because a decision have to be taken and
[50:10] the roots have to move out
[50:12] because every time the second stuff is
[50:15] broken
[50:16] it will break it will split it will
[50:18] break the brotherhood between judah and
[50:21] israel every time the message of the
[50:24] hour
[50:25] is crucified it will bring a split
[50:29] and that split is god taking his blood
[50:33] out and leaving the other part back
[50:36] and that part will go back to moab
[50:39] that part will go back to sodom that
[50:42] part will go back to their own life
[50:45] so don't be surprised if that which used
[50:48] to be a brother
[50:49] or a sister begin to repent if they
[50:52] begin to put makeups
[50:54] if they begin to go after all kind of
[50:56] worldly stuff
[50:58] to begin with they were not seed because
[51:01] if you believe this message to be the
[51:04] truth
[51:05] are you there where did the pastor
[51:07] leaves the message or not
[51:09] you're not gonna wear paint because your
[51:12] pastor left the message
[51:14] you didn't believe the message because
[51:16] of a preacher
[51:17] you believe the message by revelation
[51:21] are you there if the pastor leaves the
[51:24] message that's not your problem
[51:26] but if the person leaves the message you
[51:28] leave the message
[51:29] it is showing that you are all power you
[51:32] are locked
[51:33] you are going back again and before you
[51:36] know it they're gonna hate the message
[51:38] they become the enemy of the cross are
[51:41] you there
[51:41] it is god bringing the split
[51:45] you are not the one doing it but as roof
[51:48] you have to take a decision
[51:50] whether you want to stay in the mob or
[51:52] whether you want to go
[51:54] further with the message and when this
[51:57] church we stood for the message
[52:00] we took position for the message
[52:03] we're not going back again we are
[52:06] forgetting what happened before
[52:08] and we are heading toward the mark of

[53:35] there
[53:36] in the land of moab ruth was married
[53:40] but never have a baby are you there
[53:44] naomi taught them that there is no hope
[53:47] for you to have a husband because i'm
[53:49] already
[53:50] an old person how are you gonna cling to
[53:53] me
[53:53] if you are looking for a husband or per
[53:56] look at the possibility
[53:57] she won back but oprah never understood
[54:01] that the land of judah have a special

[54:20] praise the name of the lord there is a
[54:22] high calling calling in the land of
[54:24] judah
[54:25] brother man i'm saying many of us my
[54:26] friend has missed the mark
[54:29] of the high calling in christ it's
[54:31] because we didn't
[54:33] recognize many times a judgment bar
[54:38] there shall be disappointment when you
[54:40] realize that that religion of jesus
[54:42] christ
[54:43] it brings salvation and happiness and
[54:46] gladness
[54:47] which is called as paul said in the days
[54:50] of old
[54:51] in the way that is called what in the
[54:54] day that they call as
[54:55] crazy fanatics
[54:59] believing a crazy message that's the way
[55:02] we worship the god of
[55:04] our father are you there our pentecostal
[55:08] father worship like that
[55:10] because malachi 4 brings you back to the
[55:13] faith of the world
[55:14] we already cleaned up with them
[55:18] brother branham said just as sure as you
[55:20] are hungry
[55:22] tonight for the holy spirit it is
[55:24] something in you
[55:25] pulling you that a purpose of god in
[55:29] your life
[55:29] has got to be fulfilled just like he was
[55:33] with who
[55:34] so when wolf took a decision to stand
[55:38] for the word to follow the word
[55:41] to leave everything to lose everything
[55:45] to leave every property are you there it
[55:48] was not the roof
[55:49] doing that it was a predestination
[55:53] seed that was calling for for something
[55:56] higher
[55:58] praise the name of the lord but one of
[56:01] them said many
[56:02] you may go through lots of trouble
[56:05] and trials like we've been just remember
[56:08] there is someone who knows that's the
[56:11] way
[56:12] makes it real i do not know what is
[56:15] behind
[56:16] the curtain but i know one thing i'm
[56:18] pressing toward what
[56:20] the mark of the high calling every day
[56:23] trying to live for that great event
[56:26] that will take place someday when i
[56:29] shall see him what
[56:31] when i want to see boaz face to face
[56:35] are you there and tell the story saved
[56:37] by what
[56:39] that's the day i live for leaving those
[56:42] things which are behind
[56:44] which are i want to press on just keep
[56:48] i want this tabernacle spoken word
[56:51] tabernacle
[56:52] now that you are now that you are on
[56:56] your feet
[56:57] now you are comfortable now you got used
[56:59] to it i want you to keep pressing
[57:02] toward the mark of the eye calling
[57:04] whatever you do
[57:05] cling word be as clannish
[57:09] as you can be this clean here
[57:12] means we need to fellowship together as
[57:16] a family are you there but
[57:19] even though we fellowship as a family
[57:22] but
[57:22] always with enough mouth to reach
[57:26] and get someone else to bring them water
[57:29] when you hear that lord he's in trouble
[57:32] abraham
[57:33] pack everything and he's after his
[57:35] brother
[57:36] to rescue him and to pull him back are
[57:39] you there
[57:40] so stay together stay in unity
[57:43] but always have an arm out because
[57:46] somebody else
[57:47] might need help somewhere everybody
[57:49] clear
[57:50] but in this faith that we are now
[57:53] preaching
[57:54] and endlessly contending for we are
[57:56] contending for this message
[57:58] don't you move one end from it stay
[58:02] with the message stay with the word
[58:07] so if you believe me to be his servant
[58:10] we do believe brother branham this is
[58:13] the program of food
[58:16] the message is god's program
[58:20] it shall never be in there
[58:24] it is always be in the what
[58:27] always has and always will
[58:30] be don't expect big crowd
[58:34] stay with the world everybody clear
[58:37] so as they were going in the land of
[58:40] judah
[58:41] they lost everything everybody there
[58:44] they used to be full because naomi says
[58:47] when she was going back she said that i
[58:50] went up full
[58:51] now i'm going up empty they lost their
[58:54] building
[58:58] they lost their church they lost their
[59:01] fellowship all
[59:03] are you there because of the decision
[59:06] roof took
[59:07] she lost everything she lost her spot
[59:10] that she wanted a good spot she used to
[59:13] sit in church
[59:15] you're gonna lose that you lose the
[59:17] building
[59:18] you lose everything going like you are
[59:21] poor
[59:22] struggling like you are starting
[59:24] everything
[59:25] at zero
[59:28] are you there starting everything over
[59:32] you need to find a new building now you
[59:34] need to find new deacons
[59:36] you need to find new trustees we got to
[59:39] rebuild the house over again
[59:42] oh my god but when she was
[59:46] going in the beginning of what
[59:50] take roof chapter one
[59:57] praise the name of the lord
[1:00:00] lost everything don't fight for it
[1:00:05] don't fight for it leave it alone
[1:00:08] there is something in the land of judah
[1:00:13] there is something in the land of judah
[1:00:15] better
[1:00:17] are you there are you there
[1:00:20] take roof chapter 1 verse 22
[1:00:23] so naomi return and
[1:00:28] roof de moyabadis her daughter-in-law
[1:00:31] with her which returned out of the
[1:00:34] country of moab
[1:00:35] and they came to bethlehem in the
[1:00:38] beginning of what
[1:00:40] in the beginning not is in
[1:00:43] the season not at the end of the season
[1:00:47] but at the beginning of the barley
[1:00:51] harvest are you there but the first
[1:00:54] thing is when they left the land of moab
[1:00:58] going into the land of judah
[1:01:01] roof put herself in the hands of god
[1:01:06] because ruth say your people will be my
[1:01:10] people
[1:01:11] and your god will be my god go to
[1:01:14] chapter 2 verse 11.
[1:01:17] if you're there you can say amen and
[1:01:19] boaz answer and say to her
[1:01:21] he has fully been shown me that
[1:01:25] all that you have done to your
[1:01:26] mother-in-law since the death of your
[1:01:28] husband
[1:01:29] and how you have left your father you
[1:01:32] see that
[1:01:33] a dear one a separation happened
[1:01:36] a split remember on sunday
[1:01:39] brother branham said sometimes you're
[1:01:41] going to shake hand with the dear person
[1:01:43] based on the decision you're going to
[1:01:45] take are you there
[1:01:47] he said you left your father and your
[1:01:49] mother
[1:01:50] and the land of your nativity and i'll
[1:01:53] come to a people which you knew
[1:01:55] not before like abraham get out of your
[1:01:59] country go to a country where i shall
[1:02:01] show you
[1:02:02] how can you do that by faith
[1:02:06] everybody clear verse 12 the lord
[1:02:09] will confess your work and a
[1:02:12] full reward be giving you of the lord
[1:02:16] god of israel
[1:02:17] under what whose wings that come to us
[1:02:21] so when you are moving from a split
[1:02:25] you need to learn to trust completely
[1:02:29] under the wings of god
[1:02:33] do not lean on your own understanding
[1:02:37] you need to follow the leadership of god
[1:02:41] because the decision you took is the
[1:02:45] decision of a narrow way
[1:02:48] are you there because of the decision
[1:02:51] you took
[1:02:52] because of the path you have chosen
[1:02:55] because of the narrow way
[1:02:57] a big portion of heaven is waiting you
[1:03:01] are you there there is a portion of full
[1:03:03] reward somewhere
[1:03:05] because of the decision you took you
[1:03:08] need to begin to rely
[1:03:10] into the hand of jehovah that's why paul
[1:03:13] said that
[1:03:14] god is our sufficiency
[1:03:17] now entering the land of
[1:03:20] judah there is a mystery to that land
[1:03:24] take the toroname 11.
[1:03:28] when i get like this there's no more
[1:03:30] time we're in eternity
[1:03:33] deuteronomy chapter 11.
[1:03:37] if you dare you can say amen detroit
[1:03:40] chapter 11 verse 10
[1:03:44] we are talking about the land of judah
[1:03:50] for the land where you go to possession
[1:03:53] is not as the land of what that's what
[1:03:57] lot
[1:03:57] so remember
[1:04:02] okay from where you came from you came
[1:04:05] out where you sow your seed
[1:04:09] and water it with your foot as a garden
[1:04:13] of heaven in egypt you have to work
[1:04:17] are you there but in the land of judah
[1:04:20] you don't put your
[1:04:22] own effort you have to put on youtube
[1:04:26] remember the car wash example when you
[1:04:29] get on a car wash
[1:04:30] somebody's standing there they're gonna
[1:04:32] tell you put your car
[1:04:34] on youtube once the car is on neutral
[1:04:37] you will continue to move it is not you
[1:04:40] moving
[1:04:41] but it's the car wash moving you are
[1:04:44] there
[1:04:45] press the name of the lord verse 11 but
[1:04:47] the land where you go to possess it
[1:04:51] is the land of hills and valleys
[1:04:54] and drinks water of the reign of heaven
[1:04:58] verse 12 a land which what
[1:05:01] the lord your god care for
[1:05:05] everybody there for the eyes
[1:05:08] of the lord your god are always
[1:05:11] not sometime are you there the land you
[1:05:14] took a decision to go
[1:05:16] it is a place where god 24 hours
[1:05:20] is watching are you there because
[1:05:24] the money of israel does not sleep nor
[1:05:27] slumber so you are under full protection
[1:05:31] are you there because you trusted the
[1:05:34] wings of
[1:05:35] jehovah yeah for the eyes of the lord
[1:05:39] your god
[1:05:40] are always upon it from there
[1:05:44] even to the end of the year 360 days
[1:05:49] you are fully covered this is better
[1:05:52] than allstate
[1:05:54] it is better than geigel it is a blessed
[1:05:57] assurance
[1:05:59] jesus is mine 360.
[1:06:02] he's gonna watch off in her family he's
[1:06:05] gonna watch off with my kids
[1:06:06] he's gonna watch over my finances he's
[1:06:09] gonna watch over my business
[1:06:10] he's gonna watch off am i going out and
[1:06:13] my coming in
[1:06:14] from this step forward
[1:06:17] you gotta learn to trust into the hand
[1:06:20] of
[1:06:20] jehovah everybody here so far it was the
[1:06:24] land
[1:06:24] where barley bread was available what is
[1:06:28] wrong with this high calling
[1:06:30] brother stephen if you notice the bible
[1:06:33] mentioned
[1:06:34] barley but the bible never mentioned
[1:06:37] wheat there is a difference between
[1:06:41] barley
[1:06:42] and wheat both of them
[1:06:46] make bread everybody clear
[1:06:50] yet they are different brother obama
[1:06:53] said in the church here
[1:06:55] his balance on his scale that's
[1:06:57] revelation 6 6
[1:06:59] you see calling out a measure of wheat
[1:07:02] for what and three measures of barley
[1:07:06] for what
[1:07:07] so we see that a measure of wheat
[1:07:11] costs a penny right
[1:07:15] but three measures of barley
[1:07:19] cost also a penny everybody clear
[1:07:23] in other words the value of a wheat
[1:07:27] is three times the value of barley
[1:07:33] i'm reading to you description everybody
[1:07:35] clear
[1:07:36] yet both of them are bread
[1:07:41] see actually that is wheat and barley
[1:07:45] is what natural stuff of life
[1:07:48] that is what bread and stuff is made
[1:07:50] from everybody clear
[1:07:52] brother branham say here we must have
[1:07:54] something fresh from who
[1:07:57] his word today for this the message
[1:08:01] he is our freshness our bread that fall
[1:08:05] every day from heaven upon the believer
[1:08:08] he is our bethlehem god's house of
[1:08:10] eternal life bread
[1:08:12] christ was born in bethlehem and became
[1:08:15] god's house of eternal life bread
[1:08:17] he is the bread of life he is our
[1:08:19] bethlehem
[1:08:20] christ is our the message is your
[1:08:24] bethlehem now natural bed is called the
[1:08:27] staff of
[1:08:30] we call the natural bread like our light
[1:08:33] bread
[1:08:34] and stuff we get is called the staff of
[1:08:36] what
[1:08:38] so we found out that here both barley
[1:08:41] and wheat both of them are bred
[1:08:44] but when roof entered into the land
[1:08:47] are you there she was entering at the
[1:08:50] beginning
[1:08:51] of bali in other words the land
[1:08:55] of judah have two sort of food
[1:08:59] are you there the land of judah
[1:09:02] has both valley and wheat
[1:09:05] but there is a mystery between barley
[1:09:08] and wheat
[1:09:09] are you there take we on roof chapter 22
[1:09:13] take roof chapter 2 verse 22 hallelujah
[1:09:18] praise the name of the lord
[1:09:21] ruth chapter 2 verse 22 if you dare you
[1:09:24] can say amen
[1:09:27] everybody there verse 22
[1:09:30] and naomi said to her daughter-in-law
[1:09:34] it is good my daughter that you go out
[1:09:36] with the maiden
[1:09:38] that they meet you not in any other
[1:09:41] field we explained this before
[1:09:43] you must stay in the field of boaz for
[1:09:46] redemption
[1:09:47] are you there any kind of field can give
[1:09:50] you food
[1:09:50] except boss that's a different food
[1:09:54] verse 23 so she kept first by demandance
[1:09:58] of boaz
[1:09:59] to glean to the end of what
[1:10:02] so ruth would have to go from the
[1:10:04] beginning of bali
[1:10:06] to the end of bali are you there but
[1:10:09] watch
[1:10:10] what happened at the end of barley the
[1:10:12] bible say
[1:10:14] boss to clean to the end of barley
[1:10:16] harvest and of water
[1:10:18] so the harvest of garlic
[1:10:21] was connected to the harvest of
[1:10:24] wheat are you there but one
[1:10:27] but the wheat is already a step
[1:10:31] behind the belly so when you enter
[1:10:34] you're going to start with bali but as
[1:10:37] you're taking care of
[1:10:38] barley the wheat also is maturing
[1:10:42] but the wheat is a higher nutritional
[1:10:46] food three times higher than barley
[1:10:51] take exodus chapter nine
[1:10:55] praise the name of the lord at the
[1:10:57] opening of the seven seal
[1:10:59] the bible became a new book
[1:11:04] praise the name of the lord
[1:11:07] exodus chapter nine if you dare you can
[1:11:10] say amen
[1:11:12] verse 9 chapter 9 verse 31
[1:11:16] the bible says and the flux
[1:11:21] and the body was smitten so god spoke to
[1:11:23] moses i'm going to bring judgment when
[1:11:26] he brought judgment
[1:11:27] the barley was smitten with the flats
[1:11:30] are you there
[1:11:32] for the barley was in there here
[1:11:35] and the flats was bold in other words
[1:11:38] the valley was already mature
[1:11:40] are you there so when the judgment came
[1:11:43] it destroyed
[1:11:44] the body everybody clear verse 32
[1:11:47] but the wheat and the eye were not
[1:11:51] smitten for they were not what
[1:11:55] are you there so when these crops are
[1:11:58] growing up
[1:12:00] the wheat is always lagging behind
[1:12:03] are you there so the land of judah when
[1:12:06] you get there
[1:12:07] you're gonna find two sort of food are
[1:12:10] you there
[1:12:11] you will find a food that comes quickly
[1:12:14] are you there that's your valley
[1:12:17] you're gonna work on your body are you
[1:12:19] there but as you taking care of the
[1:12:22] years of preparation
[1:12:24] as you taking care of the first stage of
[1:12:27] brother planet ministry
[1:12:29] there is also another ministry that was
[1:12:32] following behind
[1:12:34] with the opening of the world it is
[1:12:37] still the bread
[1:12:38] but it's the bread of that is higher
[1:12:42] than the body that's why brother branham
[1:12:44] said
[1:12:45] not the years of the preparation
[1:12:48] not when he begin his message but when
[1:12:51] he begin to
[1:12:52] sound the message are you there so the
[1:12:55] message have two kind of food
[1:12:58] there is a food before 63
[1:13:01] and there is a food after 63 the food
[1:13:04] after 63
[1:13:06] matures slowly and comes behind
[1:13:09] but the value is three times higher
[1:13:12] than that which was before this hills
[1:13:19] are you there so when you go to the land
[1:13:21] of judah
[1:13:22] there you have a seven course meal you
[1:13:25] take what is the holy ghost
[1:13:27] what was the holy ghost giving for you
[1:13:29] take divine healing
[1:13:30] you take prophecy you take the gift and
[1:13:33] then you go to the opening of the world
[1:13:36] which separates you from the shack
[1:13:39] [Applause]
[1:13:41] everybody clear everybody here so far
[1:13:45] are you there that's what rude took a
[1:13:48] decision with
[1:13:49] that mystery hope i cannot see that oppa
[1:13:52] will stay back
[1:13:53] lord will stay back it is revealed in
[1:13:56] the land of judah
[1:13:59] when you get there you begin to eat this
[1:14:01] you begin to eat
[1:14:02] this you begin to eat this as the
[1:14:04] messenger is moving
[1:14:06] and the word is maturing then the wheat
[1:14:09] kicking
[1:14:09] and then the corner with that fell into

[1:35:52] is not existing because by the law
[1:35:55] you must be a levite are you there
[1:35:59] but there was a priesthood that was
[1:36:01] hidden
[1:36:03] and that priesthood if you look it's not
[1:36:06] on the liver
[1:36:07] it is under a different tribe but when
[1:36:10] you check that trap
[1:36:12] nobody from that trap work in the altar
[1:36:15] nobody in that trap working tabernacle
[1:36:18] which trap is it a royal priesthood
[1:36:22] everybody there job for verse 14
[1:36:26] for it is evident that our who
[1:36:29] who is our lord our lord sprung out of
[1:36:33] what
[1:36:34] oh my goodness so judah have a key to a
[1:36:38] priesthood a priesthood of mercy
[1:36:43] and you know by joining judah you are
[1:36:47] entering in the congregation
[1:36:48] and you become a royal priesthood
[1:36:52] and the mentees and death that's why
[1:36:55] brother branham preached
[1:36:56] who is this what telling you that you
[1:37:00] are
[1:37:00] entering into a royal episode
[1:37:03] which is judah are you there
[1:37:06] praise the name of the lord that's the
[1:37:09] reason you need that priesthood
[1:37:11] to enter why you are serving god and in
[1:37:14] the book of revelation he said
[1:37:16] i will make him a kingdom of what
[1:37:20] not under levitical law because under
[1:37:23] levitical law
[1:37:24] the law said a prince shall never
[1:37:27] tear his clothes are you there
[1:37:30] but when jesus was in front of caiaphas
[1:37:34] caiaphas asked a question and jesus
[1:37:37] comes
[1:37:38] they ask a question and come he said you
[1:37:40] don't understand caiaphas
[1:37:42] your kingship is finishing the levitical
[1:37:45] priesthood is going to be knelt down the
[1:37:48] machine said that he's entering
[1:37:50] so jesus actually took an effort he said
[1:37:52] i am
[1:37:53] he and when characters look he took the
[1:37:56] cross and did what
[1:37:59] disqualifying the levitical priest
[1:38:02] of iron and showing that melchizedek is
[1:38:07] entering in and mercy said that take
[1:38:09] your sin
[1:38:10] and go to the cross and take the
[1:38:13] ordinance that was against you
[1:38:15] and narrated the cross and you are
[1:38:17] forgiven
[1:38:18] let's stand
[1:38:21] [Music]
[1:38:22] hallelujah thank you jesus
[1:38:27] praise the name of the lord hallelujah
[1:38:31] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:38:36] church you have nothing to lose you have
[1:38:40] nothing to regret
[1:38:42] you don't regret anything you have not
[1:38:44] lost anything
[1:38:46] even though it looks like you empty like
[1:38:48] you lost your building
[1:38:50] you lost your fellowship you lost your
[1:38:53] support
[1:38:54] you lost everything you lost your
[1:38:56] friends in more
[1:38:58] you lost everything the decision you
[1:39:00] took
[1:39:01] is greater it's a point it's a high
[1:39:04] calling
[1:39:05] a calling that's going to give you bread
[1:39:08] that's going to give you the valley
[1:39:09] and it's going to give you the weak a
[1:39:11] decision that's going to bring you into
[1:39:13] a union
[1:39:14] a decision that will block out your spin
[1:39:17] a decision that will justify you because
[1:39:20] the message brought justification
[1:39:23] that's why when the cloud appear when
[1:39:25] they turned it this way
[1:39:27] it was a why judge that has a white wig
[1:39:31] and why is he coming as a child because
[1:39:34] he's indicting the nomination
[1:39:36] but he's justifying the brat because
[1:39:39] judge is also your lawyer praise the
