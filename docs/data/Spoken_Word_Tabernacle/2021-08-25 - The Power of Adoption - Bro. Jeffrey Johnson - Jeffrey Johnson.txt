jesus for the blood blood so me when me and my wife just went down to florida we visited the church that i uh grew up in i was born and raised going to that church down in sarasota florida and they did this song that actually i've never heard before but it was i tell you what it was it was extremely powerful and the thing that was most powerful to me is while we were singing it i was looking out like i was looking out over the congregation i was sitting towards the back and i saw all the all the people that i grew up with you know of all ages young old i've seen people that have struggled really really struggled i personally know their testimonies and some was drugs some was you know adultery or fornication or different things ones that really struggled and while we were singing the song i noticed that the whole church was reacting and everybody was on fire and everybody was entering in but i saw the ones that really went through though i went through a personal struggle or not just a struggle but met god face to face met the person of god and they had a completely different worship about them they were they were screaming they were shouting they were just completely opened up and that's where i was at because i know what god did for me and i know the power of the blood and when these people caught just through this song they caught just a revelation of the power of the blood they just let go and and i thought about that and i'm like if you can't truly enter into this song then maybe you gotta pray for a personal personal experience with god because if god has done something for you then truly you know the power of the blood and this song should mean something to you so before we sing it i just want to go through the lyrics real quick and just read the lyrics to you and you can read along with me behind me as they keep playing it but the first verse says [Music] it says this says i was a wretch i remember who i was i was lost i was blind i was running out of time sin separated to preach that was far too wide but from the far side of the chasm you have held me in your sight and it says so you have made a way across the great divide left behind heaven's throne to build it here inside and there's at the cross you paid the debt that i owed broke the chains free my soul for the first time i have hope and the core says thank you jesus for the blood applied thank you jesus you have washed me white thank you jesus you have saved my life brought me from darkness into the glorious light and it continues there's another second verse that we'll sing but i'll just skip to the bridge here the bridge says there is nothing stronger than the wonder working power of the blood that calls us sons and daughters how many believe you're a son and daughter this evening calls us sons and daughters we are ransomed by the father through the blood the blood so we're gonna sing it this evening and i've just learned it recently myself so you all can learn it with me we'll go to the first verse i was a rich i remember who i was i was lost i was blind i was running out of time sin separated the breach was far too wide but from the far side of the chasm you held me in your sights so you made a way across the great divide left behind heaven's throne to build it here inside and there at the cross you paid the dead i broke my chains freed my soul for the first time i had hope thank you jesus for the blood apply [Music] [Applause] [Music] thank you jesus you have saved my life brought me from the darkness to the glorious you took my place laid inside my tomb you were buried for three days but then you walked right out again and now death has no sting and life has nowhere for i have been transformed by the blood of the lamb thank you jesus for the blood [Music] jesus you have saved my life [Music] brought me from the darkness into glorious [Music] there is nothing stronger than the wonder working power of the blood [Music] that calls the sons and daughters we are ransomed by our father through the blood [Music] stronger than the underworking power of the blood oh the blood that calls the sons and daughters we are ransomed by the father through the blood [Music] thank you jesus [Applause] [Music] thank you jesus [Music] you brought me from the darkness you brought me from the darkness into glorious i wonder if we can do this without the music can wash in nothing but the blood of jesus and what can make me holy is [Music] [Music] nothing but the blood [Music] [Applause] amen thank you lord thank you does anybody have a testimony on their heart this evening or a prayer request mr zaddy um i just i'm gonna make it short but i just want to give um glory to god um over the weekend um i visited a church and um the preacher uh some events happened during the weekend that god had complete control of with a woman getting you know her deliverance and from anxiety and fear and um painting her chest there's a lot more to the story

tonight [Music] are you happy are you happy tonight amen there is no better place than the house of the lord amen you come in this church you just feel the presence of the lord there is like a special anointing in this place amen blessed be the name of the lord tonight i'm not preaching brother jeffrey johnson from ghana made his way in to the u.s so he was in uh new york with brother salmon then he went to boston then he came all the way down here he's in charlotte with us so i have to pass the ball and let somebody score amen the amazing part is brother robert remind me that the first minister that preached in the hotel when we start this church the first one was brother jeffrey johnson can you imagine and god orchestrated everything when we got into this building again the first one who's going to preach his brother jeffrey johnson [Music] [Applause] it's amazing do you know who was the first one to preach in the hotel [Music] you do your homework but i can give you a clue if you know the first one who preached in this church and the first one to preach is brother jeffrey do you think it's a coincidence [Music] the same god that was working there and the same way he started with us he is continuing higher and higher and higher and one of this day the force of gravity will not have any influence on us before you know it will be lighter and ready to fly and meet our lord into the sky amen blessed be the name of the lord everybody happy everybody on board with the sermon nobody behind you understand that you're a vessel of mercy there's nothing that can destroy you no fire no mountain nothing you are built for that one amen you know when god gives a vision sometimes we look at the panoramic plan the big plan of the vision it's like joseph when he had a vision first he saw the 11th star and him in the middle and the other star were bowing to him and then he saw the sun and the moon that was together bowing and then he saw the shift put together and all his brothers sheep were bowing to his sheep so the interpretation was given to his father in a big picture they just told him you think that all of us will be bowing down to you which was showing that there could be a position of a leadership somewhere down in the future amen but like brother nadu preached one time the stuff in between was never revealed amen that was luck under the seventh seal amen he knew that one of this day he's going to reach a higher position but how to reach that position that was not disclosed amen but when the seals open up the seals give you the detail [Music] amen and the avenue of everything if you notice before you even have a sheep you first have to cut the wheat from somewhere and you have to collect the wheat and bound it amen then you take the wheat and position it so joseph have to be cut from his land he have to be cut from his parent and he have to be bound as a slave then he have to be positioned in egypt that mystery was still in the vision but it could not be unfold it was just still under the seventh seal amen that's why when the seals are broken the bible became a new book when you begin to navigate you can see the trace now we know where we're going we know where we come from we even know after our rapture what's gonna happen during the tribulation period we know when we come back we know about the millennium we even know about the new jerusalem even the dimensions of the new jerusalem everything has been unfold by the message of the hour his blood amen that he that he shed purchase us and we belong to him there is nothing not even death not even the first death or the second death nothing can destroy you because you were eternal amen if you don't believe it just wait till the weekend and you're gonna see where you came from let me call by the jeffrey johnson before i start preaching tonight amen brother jeff for you can come can we sing only believe me that's easier for me amen well long [Music] we believe all things are possible [Music] [Music] lord i believe lord [Music] oh yes [Music] lord [Music] [Applause] [Music] blessed in the name of the lord jesus christ thank you for the lord for your greatness thank you lord jesus christ we believe here with all our hearts we say blessed be the holy land again we are so grateful and we are more than grateful in all things that have done for us we thank you for your greatness and your saving grace that have brought us all this far predestinated before the foundation of the world that these days will gather around your shed blood under your shed blood to feast in and digging in those things you are gravy for us in this life the true prophet we are so grateful we say blessed be the holy name as we humbly bow before you with all our heart full of appreciation for your great mercy and love and victory over hell and every power of the kingdom of darkness and have brought us once again sound healthy together to fellowship with you and to worship you as our god and our savior our creation of agility our fate and our victory may your presence take us all the control feel these entire places arrest every presence of the enemy push back every wickedness of the kingdom of darkness and let this place oh god be protected under your shed god a place of refuge a place o god where people will crank in and be saved and be delivered a place where people were running and find you and see you in the supernatural power of your holy ghost manifesting in the midst of your people we thank you who have brought us here once again let the blood of jesus speak for us and meet everyone at the very point of need let the blood of jesus speak for us defy every unbelief and every oh god father spirit of resentment and let the holy ghost even as it was in the house of colonials let it be onto us as we only buy before you with all our heart full of expectations for that we should have for us come lord i surrender my will unto you i give myself away for these are your people for what good is it in a man that can be of a blessing to your people if not you alone therefore i must decrease even as the scripture said we decrees oh god this hour that you will step in and increase oh god in our hearts through body and spirit granted we wait on you in the name of jesus christ we pray amen praise be to god hallelujah you love the lord yes you love the lord let's give a big clap for free to the lord let's give the lord a better one you know we give him our best you can do better than that i think you can still do better than that better better better hallelujah hallelujah david said i was glad when they say let's go to the house of god there is no place like being in the house of god especially when you are in a place where hallelujah the lord has made for you hallelujah praise the lord god bless you richly [Music] you know for a long time i'm not somebody who is good in expressing myself so your pastor you already know your pastors have introduced me and i think that would be enough but if there is anything you think i have to say and i have not said that maybe you can help me later and i will know how to handle that so may god help us so i want to appreciate the pastor for giving me another opportunity to be here this evening to come and speak to the bride of the lord in this part the prophet said the greatest privilege a servant of god we have is to have the opportunity to speak to the bride so i can't myself more privileged and may god bless you all for your time to come here to come and worship your god and i want to let you know your god will never disappoint you hallelujah so without wasting our time i want us to quickly open our scripture because time is always our enemy hallelujah so i think i will try to i would like to have something just a time written so that i place it here i think it will help us so if you do that i will be happy hallelujah so without wasting our time let's open our scripture quickly to the book of ephesians hallelujah the book of ephesians chapter one from verse 1 i want to read through 12 to help us a little hallelujah okay ephesians chapter one from verse one i read paul an apostle of jesus christ by the will of god amen this is what we are talking about amen hallelujah a servant of god by the will of god there is something different in here hallelujah and if you are born of the spirit you don't nobody tells you that the anointing that brought you will tell you that this one is the servant of god amen god bless seriously kelly god bless you it's one of my best friends in the whole north carolina hallelujah it's nice to be in the house of god paul an apostle of jesus christ by the will of god amen i won't stop there i always want to stop this so let me move on to the saints which are at ephesus and to the faithful in christ jesus grace be to you and peace from god our father and from the lord jesus christ hallelujah amen blessed be the god and father of our lord jesus christ amen who had blessed us with all spiritual blessing in heavenly places in christ hallelujah according as he had chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him in love amen hallelujah having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by jesus christ to himself according to the good we to according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of his glory of his grace wherein he had made us acceptable accepted in the beloved in whom we have redemption through his blood the forgiveness of sin according to the riches of his grace wherein he had abandoned towards us in all wisdom and prudent having made known unto us the mystery of this world according to his good pleasure which he had what purpose in himself not you hallelujah may god help us in jesus name that in the dispensation of the fullness of time he might gather together in all in one all things in christ both which are in heaven and which are on earth even in him in whom also we have obtained an inheritance yes let's obey the name of the lord being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worked all things after the council of his old world world i love that let's give a clap of into the lord jesus the bride they are robots they are the robot of the lord we are remoted by the holy spirit he made all his powerhouses in our hearts he controls us we are not of ourselves because he worked at everything to this own way him who have called us he is the one doing everything so you're being here today you're taking stand with the word and for standing with your pastor it is not a mistake somebody is behind it may god help us tonight hallelujah 12 that we should be to the praise of his glory who first trust in christ may god bless the reading of his word in jesus name hallelujah okay god bless you may be seated okay i want us to add one more scripture just to support what we have read saint john chapter 10 3 and 4 and 27 and also first john chapter 2 verse 27 we'll take it and see how god will help us and help us to be brief tonight hallelujah saint john chapter 10 verse 3 and 4 i read to him the potter opened it and the sheep hear his voice and he called his own sheep by name and leaded them out yes and when he put that forth his whole ship he goes before them and now they should follow him before they do what brother help me there let us work together hallelujah i love that and the verse 27 to save our time we jump down to 27. my sheep hear my voice and i know them and they follow me therefore we take our time this evening to go through something that is common among the message but we will go in some way else but god will keep us in line with the scripture and the message hallelujah i want to talk about the power of adoption we are not talking of adoption we are talking of the power of adoption we are all used to adoption it is a it's like a national anthem to the bride hallelujah it's our abc that we start and hallelujah the power of adoption we know as the scripture said adoption is all about predestination [Music] but we want to talk about the power behind the adoption but we must do to be adopted it's all about predestination we just read it right now the scripture is clear praise the lord and the scripture said hallelujah amen amen in whom we have redemption through his blood the forgiveness of our sin according to the riches of his grace where he had abandoned towards us all wisdom and prudence having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he had proposed in himself praise the lord hallelujah praise the lord and verse 11 i want to say in womb we also have obtained inheritance being predestinated adoption is all about predestination amen praise the lord amen hallelujah and the prophet said in the message let me start from you hallelujah [Music] i want to read something from the message that what the prophet said before i go on hallelujah the prophet said here in the message this great warrior david hallelujah he said there you are i'm reading from paragraph 32 he knows where he was standing he knows he was a man of faith he believed god god was in him he knew he was anointed you haven't sought god but god has sought you it wasn't you calling for god it was god calling for you and when god called you it shows he elected you you accepted the call it was justification you accepted the call and that was justification hallelujah then you gave your heart to christ and was filled with the holy ghost and you and now you are positionality are you with me did you see yourself let's keep on talking about ourself it's good to talk about ourselves because there is joy knowing about yourself so every day in life we exploit ourselves we have our spiritual potentials so all we have to do in the national explore your potential in the spiritual what you do you explore your potential so when you are talking about the message and you come to predestination you are exploiting your spiritual potential so tonight we are going to continue to exploit our spiritual potential because hallelujah the prophet said you are positionally blessed in the body of christ now if it made you quit your old habit and act like a christian how to if it will do that for you it will heal your body because it is a promise amen there you have predestination adoption is all about predestination hallelujah that's why the scripture said for whom he for knew also he predestinated to be confirmed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among brethren moreover them he predestinated them he also called in whom he called hallelujah then he justified and whom he justified then he glorified and when and what shall we say to these things if god be for us who can be against us in other words if god called you hallelujah and you respond to his call not because it is your will or because you love god not because you sought god or because you want to serve you know god but god in his great mercy before the foundation of the world hallelujah that knows his home and hallelujah called them by their name and he said if you are my sheep you will definitely hear my voice to hear is to understand to understand is to recognize so when you hear the call you will recognize the world across you so the power of adoption lies on the ability of the individual to respond to the voice to recognize the wonder cost [Applause] the power of adoption lies on the ability of the individual to respond and before you can respond you have to recognize it and for you to recognize it you have to got the revelation you have to understand you have to know who is calling you before you can respond let go help us tonight hallelujah [Music] it's a call you are to respond to something you have to recognize first and you are responding to it amen hallelujah and you have to recognize it before you can respond if you don't recognize you can respond hallelujah now let me say i used to call your pastor brother etienne let's take our time and take a good look at the power of adoption in this way again let me say brother tell him please come hallelujah ask me did i tie rope on him did i ask somebody to pull him and come why did i just say when i take him just keep coming there is something that pulls him and makes him to get up and respond to me and walk and camp yes i didn't tie him i didn't drag him we are talking about the power of adoption [Music] a voice yes in the days of the voice of the seventh agent when we begin to stand how the mystery of god will be finished as he has declared to his servant the prophet and if you are not the prophet what are we going to do with all your miracles in the name of holy ghost we don't deny you are not doing miracle in the name of holy ghost but when you are not the prophet what are we going to do with that it's all good for nothing good for the shaking hallelujah but not for the ego hallelujah in the days of the voice all the mystery it really says something will be left oh hallelujah and jesus said my sheep knows my voice and definitely they will respond to it and the bible made us to know god cannot do anything unless he revealed it first to his servant the prophet so if god is going to call if god has as a preacher as as a for not if god has for knowledge and have to predestinate then he have to give us a prophet if he has a foreknowledge that he have to do he has to predestinate then he have to give us a prophet hallelujah so there is a reason for brother 18 to respond and first you have to hear the voice you have to hear says as the book of john said my sheep knows hear my voice so first of all you have to hear hallelujah amen and when he hear you know there is something in hearing to hear me to understand and when you understand it catch your old that is why jesus said a stranger they will no longer follow because when they hear he diverts all the attention to the words note that they are not aware of all the noise that the chickens are making around they are hundred percent away but because they're here blessed are your ears for they can hear for because they hear a stranger they cannot follow me they knew that there are strangers everywhere and they have their work but this one they hear his voice let me go ahead post tonight a stranger that we no longer follow they hear my voice note he have to hear before it can follow are you with me without hearing he can follow and to hear means to understand and in the spiritual realm it's called revelation so we have to call the revelation of the voice of the one that caused him before he can get up because he knew that the one who caused him he knew him if brother completely didn't know even if it is outside maybe he's going somewhere and i saw him somewhere maybe at the walmart say oh brother personally immediately tony said oh brother you start responding just coming to have a hug or a shake understanding who is calling him divert his attention from every other thing [Music] amen hallelujah so when we hear the voice of the promise of our day that god is sending us a prophet there is no other voice we can be going to our walmart with our friends and we can be doing all our shopping with our relationships but hallelujah when we hear his voice is a different thing entirely because it's a total turning around hallelujah all these have passed away everything has become new why because in your mind by understanding you have discovered your potential [Music] you have come to the revelation of your reality and when a man comes to the revelation of his reality what can take him away what can distract his attention again come to the revelation of your yes reality what you are yes sir yes my brother thank you yes sir thank you lord may god help us to hear is to follow is to understand and if you don't understand you cannot follow hallelujah amen because when paul was going right the people that was with him the prophet said paul was meeting down but they can't see nothing but paul sees something and they are wondering hallelujah and paul by revelation of what he see and here asking them to send him to somewhere and they cannot understand why he is asking them to send him to such a place [Music] your calling is not your willingness you are responding to something that is beyond you that is the reason why you can live this way you are living that is the reason why you can rejoice in the gospel and you love serving god in this way and the people cannot understand and they look at the entire atmosphere and the present life that is on the ground and they look at you and they cannot tell how you are living in such a way you say brother i loved a lot you didn't love the lord the prophet said nobody loved the lord nobody seek the lord nobody desire god it is god that desire you in the garden of adam you need them the prophet said it is not adam that was seeking lord lord where are you it was god who was seeking other where are you so brother and sister by the crucifixion and the blood of jesus christ we have all come to the revelation back to our bishop to recognize our position in christ before the foundation of the world [Music] amen and what we read the prophet said if god can make it i want to be brief because we have some descent the prophet said if god can do such a thing and make you live against your will i'm not living against my way that's my revelation that because i called the revelation i said yes you called the revelation you are living against your will you say how let's break it down a little bit [Music] that is the reason why sometimes when we see our friends our colleagues and we went go to work and school with them we are we last after the things they do and even sometimes we want to buy clothes we love the clothes but something is in you telling you don't buy this one [Music] you you in your heart you love it and something that is telling you no so then it becomes a pulling each other walk i just wanna and sometimes yes god bless you the white dog and the black dog and you say i don't see anything wrong with it because it's looking nice i think at least other christians can wear this one you see that tells you it is not your will that tells you your desire is there but something else is pulling you making you to deny your own desire so therefore paul said the things i want to do hallelujah those things i love doing i find myself doing not doing it and those things i don't want to do those are the things i end up doing why because it is not the will of paul hallelujah what is the secret christ in him [Music] hallelujah amen it is not our own desire that we should be saved but it is the will of our own father and the scripture says he walketh everything to his own will that's exactly right amen if god can make you live against your will what is the situation in this life that can hold you [Music] the prophet and the bible said the most powerful man on earth is a man who can defeat himself and the biggest devil you have and the injustice you have in this life is yourself so if you can defeat yourself there is nothing you cannot defeat why because the god that justify you is with you hallelujah the power of adoption the god that justify you is with you and isaiah when he caught the revelation as a causing shine of abraham and there are a whole lot of trouble all over the places isaiah rose up i said the god that justify me is here yes amen now he said who is my contender let him come [Music] the god that justify you is always there don't look it to be something that it is kind of a fanaticism that where is the god or what is again do just leave that one alone just look at your wholesales how you can live against your way that tells you that god that justify you is dead and that is the secret why you can live against your way and in all situations isaiah said the god that justified me is here who is my contender let him come and stand by my side and i tell you the god that justify me will fight for me brother tonight i'll tell you the power of adoption that thing that causes you to respond is make you to live against your way that is the god that justifies you he is with you and always constrain you that you must not live to yourself that you must live to him because he died and paid the price that those who will leave will no longer live for themselves but to live for him who died for them so therefore the bible said if god be with us who can be against us brother i just want god to help us that tonight you see the foolishness of the devil here so that you can know what to do with it you know like the maradona and the uh mikey all this processional footballer you know when they hold the ball the boy is on their leg they know what to do with it that's what i want you to do tonight i want you to know what to do with the devil i want you to come i want you to see him as a footballer on your leg so you your face detain it we detect we decide what to do with it whether to pass it somewhere or to kick it yeah or to send it down to the goal may go help us tonight may god help us tonight let go help us tonight the power of seduction that cause you to live against you that make you to deny yourself to go contract your way that is the god of your justification and that god is here whether you believe it or not he's here whether you accept it or not he's here i'm telling you this because i can see that the god who justify you is with you you don't need to tell me plenty stories you don't need to tell me plenty stories you become shy in your working place you become shy in your school and you think that the people will mock you they are not mocking you let me tell you a secret the people are rather afraid of you they are not mocking you the people are afraid of you they are not mocking you so you start feeling shy no they are only throwing words on you just like the dog when you see you coming back but when you know who you are that the god who created you made you superior more than the god like david said who is this philistine that god has made me superior by the covenant of abraham over this philistine the same god we bring him before my faith when you stand like david that recognized that god made you superior to the lion and knocked the lion and he came to his enemy goliath he remembered god made him superior what comes to his mind that makes him to know he remember the convent he's living under him he know that there is the covenant as a blood that has a voice that speaks to his heart the spirit to his heart the promise of the covenant that your children abraham will possess the gifts of their enemy so when anything comes before the end as the enemy he rise up he said the god who make me superior over this situation that i will possess the gates of my enemy and if you are coming as my enemy therefore the god who justified me we possess you for me hallelujah joshua and caleb said be not afraid of all these giants be not afraid if god that justify us call us if he has spoken according to the promise of this covenant we are standing said he has given us the land therefore take no thought of it for the same god who gave you the promise the same one will go ahead of you because the bible said to him to them he for knew he pre-recorded and then he called he predestinated and then he predestinated he justified then he then he are you included he not you then he called then he justified then he predestinated where is your work there nothing oh god god will help us now we'll continue to know where our work is today we will know where our work is there that god he who justified he who he who he who where are you there somebody that god that justify you is always with you be not afraid who is your contender if he has grace and he he he have eyes let him come and stand before you so the things you think you are passing through as a persecution as a mockery hallelujah it's just a scarecrow that the devil tried to scare you not not that not that you are failing but when you recognize yourself like david and say god make me superior over you so who are you dog to come and be go go and scare me away okay let's see who is powerful when you take your first step he will take his one step back when you take the other one he will take the other one but watch when he's going backwards he never stop backing you see go go and you come again he will go back one you say go go and you will go again here we go back again he will not want to give up till his time come he will still be backing [Music] so all those things you think is a persecution and sometimes you see that oh i have been depressed the enemy is just trying to disbelieve what god gives you as a victory because he can't do you nothing only thing he can do is to make you drunk deny the world and when you deny it he laughed and he ran to go at me mister go hi mr god look at him he will be talking about him let me deal with tim smalls he hasn't even gone out he has all his freedom to deal with you the prophet said the devil can do you nothing until first you step out of the way yes my brother he can't do you nothing brother we are on the winning ground we are on the winning side nobody can defeat us nothing can take us nothing can scare us because the bible said we are not filled with the spirit of fear [Applause] [Music] yes my brother amen that brings you to bondage i make you think that oh you have been deprived oh then if not because the message i have i would have get this thing so you start thinking what is it you are bringing yourself into bondage that's exactly right but brother and sister the power of adoption the god that justify you the one behind the bible said we are born not of corruptible things but the incorruptible word of the living god hallelujah and there is power in the world which is the voice that is why when you can cause somebody you don't tie him he keep responding because every voice there is a power in it yes there is a power in this speaking word yes even your word you are speaking there is power yet and therefore as we close the bible said hallelujah it is written that i believe we believe hallelujah let's relax we want to close that words that have power to give you victory is the same god that justifies you and that word is in you meaning the god that justify you is in you therefore the scripture says he that is in you who that god the one who justifies you the word is in you so paul said the word is near unto you isaiah said the god that justify me is near and in the new testament paul said the word is near to you and the word is the same man who justify you because it gives his word of justification and you respond to it and walk hallelujah and he sanctify you and he fill you with himself amen are you with me the word is near unto you that's exactly right and he went for that and said it is even in your mouth there is power in the world and that word is in your so what is in your mouth you don't need to struggle you don't need to argue with people what is it their word their power is in your mind so what do you do speak [Applause] hallelujah speak the word speak enemy forward for paul said the word is near unto you even in your mouth and with your heart you believe it oh hallelujah with a heart a man believe hallelujah i am with the mouth the mouth confession you speak and possess your possession because the god that justify you is in you in the form of a word the power that is over that overcome every other power the power that defeats the devil as the prophet said the word in your mouth can defeat the devil anytime anywhere any situation any condition so they were tonight is in your mind brother and you believe it and you have respond to it tonight you believe it and you have respond to it tonight so therefore speak [Music] [Applause] what is it handle it and rainbow like this and like it ain't like this [Music] [Applause] [Music] shall we be on our feet i'm trying to avoid a lot of things because on sunday's day when you run into something it will take you more time to explain so you god help you hallelujah so i want us to read this thing against too close listen we are closing with it the prophet said don't be scared so that we are going to play the devil like football to our own skill so first of all you don't have to be afraid so now you know that you are in control of the ball but if you are afraid you are not in control of the ball so we are in the football field now because paul was playing and he was typing it with the football field so we are also in the football field now hallelujah but first of all before you can move with confidence with the power you have to be confident you must see that you are more professional than the man then you give you inspiration the boss i was talking one time sorry he was talking one time he said he said is it muhammad ali yes he said there is a fight you want to fight the man was powerful that him so because he knew that the guy was powerful so his name because he knew that every his name has created a fear so he want to stand in the confidence of his name so because of what he know his motherly well known so he came with that confidence and he was just straightening the man and the man was afraid and he confessed that he knew that that man would defeat him but he just used a confidence so i want you to have the confidence now and for you to have the confidence to put away every fear amen then you are in control with the ball you put it like this as i put my leg and you know what to dream about hallelujah the prophet said don't be scared i'm reading from the message here is voice because we are responding to a voice so let's see what will happen since we have respond to the voice he said don't be scared to take god at ease just relax and have faith hallelujah and have what faith and god for that and believe he washes over and believes he watches over you he that justify me is yeah where is my contender let him come my god will fight for me oh hallelujah and belief and he watches over you now let's go for that if we disintegrate anything listen not kamu that tried to bother you [Music] have you seen yourself now are you in control of the boner i want everybody to be in control because we are going to score good we don't want to pass past the ball we don't pass to anybody we want to score a direct goal the bible said he watches over you and he will disintegrate anything that will bother you oh it might attack you it might attack you that i it can harm you for all things he permits it it could not be nothing else for its working together for good to damn that word [Music]

name of the lord you bless tonight it is always good to be in the house of the lord amen amen amen amen hallelujah i hope you already realized this for a long time that this church is driven by the holy spirit amen i met brother jeffrey here tonight he came on monday we never met tuesday no this is the first time i met him you know what he preached right it seems like he was in this church amen but he was not so it's somebody greater than me greater than you it is the holy spirit amen it is the holy spirit the god that justifies you that same god stand beside you amen that's why when they challenge brother branham brother branham took the bible and put it on the pulpit and he said you come and stand right there and challenge me brother branham knew that the god that justified him was standing right there and brother branham say all the preachers stood there nobody moved by the brandon said they knew better they knew who was standing there he was not brother branham he was the angel of the lord amen the one who identified with brother branham on the picture the same angel stood for him and that same angel is standing for this church and for every believer that is in this church amen you have nothing to do with me all i did i heard the call and i just responded to the call and you heard the call just look around you this is not a work of a man this is only god can do what we can experience here tonight amen and we thank him for his grace we thank him for his love we thank him for his mercy because he's the one as the scriptures say he put the love of the truth in our heart god's speaking to god that's why brother branham said when two omnipotent meet the real you that is insane meeting with god when two omnipotent means the miraculous will definitely happen church i already told you multiple times you don't have to do anything in this thing just take god at his word believe what he says speak the word and move forward amen i'm going to give you a short testimony i forgot to give it it's probably last week if i'm not mistaken i was at work and the employee everybody left and i had no patient note that i was tapping on and i had some some of my clothes that i needed to drop at the dry cleaner and pick up some of them but the dry cleaner closes at six o'clock and here i was in between either leaving the note and right for the dry cleaner or i can just continue with the note and then miss the dry cleaner and suddenly a thought came to me why not just pray i say lord may you hold that dry cleaner until i finish my stuff what i'm doing here and i sat calmly and i continued to do my patient note until i finished i closed everything it's past six o'clock i put the alarm and everything and i left and i stopped at the dry cleaner for some reason the dry cleaner sign is open and the door is wide open and there is nobody in the shop at the desk i enter him and there is a signal when you enter in the door ring a bell and suddenly the owner came out and he kind of looked around like questioning why was the door still open you know what i gave him the clothes the other clothes i picked up the clothes and as soon as i left i entered in the car do you know what happened he turned the sign off he even closed the door and turned the light off [Music] church we have a mighty garden we have a chew and a living god amen that god is living he's the same yesterday today and forever call him on the scene he's there he can do a lot of stuff in your life amen just recognize him call him he's always there he's not going to leave you he's not going to forsake you he will be with you all the way amen there is nothing that's going to bother you whatever the devil is bringing to harm you the one who's there you know the holy one of israel never even sleep nor slumber he slept in the man jesus christ because he was human who could sleep there but when he went back to god 24 hours it's more than your security amen anything that will come to bother you he will disintegrate everything amen so go with that confidence hold your ball pretty good and tell the devil what to do and where to go amen and direct him you can cast him back to hell you can cast him to the dry places depending on where you want him to go but you have the power as the sons and daughters of god you can see the same channel you are vessels of mercy the god who's reaching mercy amen that's why david said surely goodness and what shall when [Music] even the day that you think it's bad there is no bad day for you never been a bad day for you it is bad in your human perception but in god's way god knew exactly what he was doing amen you don't have to fret about nobody you don't have to worry about who's talking about you you don't have to worry about who's talking about this church you don't have to worry about who's waiting to see what's going to happen in the church where there's something will fall and then they're going to prove what they were trying to prove it's not going to happen because it's god amen gamalia say take not a risk to fight against god if this thing starred by god there's no man that can stop it and for sure is started by god and we recognize the god that is working in this church god richly bless you may god strengthen you may god protect you may god continue to shine his face upon you and open his blessings like david say i have a scripture in the book of psalms david said god sent your blessing may he send your blessings and renew his mercy every morning because he that loves you shall never leave you nor forsake you he will be with you all the way to the end god bless you brother if you can lead us with a song yes sir come on anybody able you're gonna take after body jeffy god richly bless you for me it's not an answer amen it didn't happen any chance for you to be at the hotel the first one and to be the hotel here spiritually it's picking something amen you want me let me just the time the day he came in the hotel what a great just a minute i was sitting in the back can i say it i knew him from the old church and he was coming and we met we looked at each other and i stood we hugged so happy he was going to the pulpit to preach and then i went back and i sat in the corner and i was just watching then we would have been in communication he went to new york and he was blocked because of kovid so he asked me he said did you find a pastor [Laughter] i took a picture where brother robert and brother maurice was praying for me and i sent him the picture he said wow so you're the pastor he said the lord spoke to me when i was going to the pulpit and i met you a voice spoke to me that you gonna be the pastor amen and when he passed me the voice spoke to him something else i locked that up and it happened exactly what the lord told him exactly happened right after the election god bless you by the great [Applause] uh this is like brother kelly the other day when he said fire was shut up in his bones brother what transpired here tonight there is a sister that i have known for 40 years her and her husband they were out in the world 40 years ago and she had a very high class beauty salon up in hendersonville well her mom her dad passed away and her mom and dad were believers and her her dad passed away and her mom wanted to continue to go to church and this was

what is wrong with this picture you know and we're expecting like brother chad said he said do we expect fairy dust to come down and change our bodies brother sister it's time it's time we start speaking you know and i believe that sister is rising out of that bed there's enough there what you were saying there brother i believe the spoken word has left this building just like the prophet said when they pray for that that car that was stolen and it went down that road and it found that guy and it turned him around and i believe the spoken word has left here it has went to that sister laying in that bed and she's coming out of there [Applause] hallelujah amen if you're going to speak the word you got to know who you are so davin can you put that up there i know who i am [Music]
