[7:15] I bring you in the resurrection with me
[7:19] hungry hearted Eagles reach for that
[7:21] just as hard as I can
[7:23] it's a pearl of great price that this
[7:25] tell everything else to go back god help
[7:29] us friend our churches are losing their
[7:32] identification that's quickly now hard
[7:35] to go to son what's the action of those
[7:37] disciples scared they know Jesus was the
[7:41] truth but you see it was against the
[7:44] popper idea the popper religion of the
[7:47] hour the most victus relation sarah
[7:51] pharisees sadducees it was so forth
[7:53] their Klux Klan's and denominations they
[7:56] were they were against that heresy but
[7:59] Jesus was the identified word and Jesus
[8:03] is the holy ghost and spirit a little
[8:08] while the world saved me I'm wearing you
[8:10] shall see me not the body
[8:13] there was any God that poll in the
[8:15] church to call souls like he did then
[8:18] obedient I always do that which is
[8:21] pleasing to my father which one of you
[8:23] can cues me of seeing in other words sin
[8:25] is unbelief
[8:26] what has the word said about me that I
[8:28] haven't done show me what the word say
[8:32] that I do it I didn't do which one can
[8:34] accuse me which one come a your fingers
[8:36] only you say that I haven't fulfilled my
[8:38] father's word oh when the Pentecostal
[8:41] church gets to that spot who can accuse
[8:45] me if I believe Oh Christians be
[8:49] identified not as a hawk but an eagle
[8:51] that Hawk is soft he'll come down you
[8:54] never see eagle doing that he'll never
[8:56] do that he wants his own food out of the
[8:57] blue
[8:58] God's prepared him so I can see it he is
[9:01] fresh manna not something is dead in the
[9:04] Hebrews for they cross through the
[9:05] waters they eat try to eat dead man it
[9:08] had become stagnant it had it had we go
[9:12] tails in it you know what we need it's
[9:15] contaminated rotten Magus is in it
[9:18] why would I eat a food that have been
[9:20] dead years ago it might be in form and
[9:24] shape but it isn't fresh we got to get
[9:27] food every generation do so does the
[9:31] eagle look for that food and
[9:33] regeneration as we're in our journey
[9:35] notice now let us take some people again
[9:38] let's take some of the Old Testament
[9:40] prophets see what they did
[9:42] let's look first it's Stephens how
[9:44] Stephens in the midst of that Sanhedrin
[9:46] Council when that council brought him
[9:49] out there that create assembly of
[9:50] believers are supposed to be believers
[9:52] brought him up and tried to condemn him
[9:54] why he said you stiff necks
[9:56] uncircumcised in heart years you always
[9:59] resist the Holy Ghost
[10:00] that's that eternal life as your
[10:03] father's did it back get her through the
[10:05] prophets are you doing it today and they
[10:07] hashed a pony with her teeth they didn't
[10:09] want to hear that here's the gift sir
[10:10] Creed is against her denomination and
[10:12] they stoned the man to death he raised
[10:14] his hands up the torch heavens to us he
[10:16] heavens open and Jesus standing right
[10:18] side Wow
[10:19] he had the resurrection quickening power
[10:23] any that took him into the bows
[10:25] Jesus noticed quickly now look at Philip
[10:29] down there and a great revival having a
[10:32] revival Court have been garrison for any
[10:34] minute while if we had to go big
[10:36] cooperation amongst the churches and
[10:38] everything tellers having a great
[10:39] revival and the quickening power of God
[10:42] spoke to Behcet's Stevens may have said
[10:44] this you're having a great revival but I
[10:47] got one man of what she talked to and
[10:50] Stevens obedient no matter what it is
[10:53] how much criticism Oh Stevens you can't
[10:55] leave but I can God said so and he went
[10:58] out into the desert and out there he
[11:00] found this uni and what happened he said
[11:03] has if thou believest with all thine
[11:06] heart that Jesus is the Son of God I'll
[11:09] baptize him when he baptized him oh he
[11:11] was quickened by this quick new power to
[11:13] leave a revival of thousands of people
[11:17] to go out into the desert to one man Oh
[11:20] that'd be against all reasons see why
[11:25] these 10,000 won't you hear but there's
[11:27] one won't amount there see and the
[11:31] quickening power sit into God's
[11:33] providing place hallelujah man and women
[11:37] it'll make you stand to your feet
[11:38] it'll make you do the things that God
[11:40] wants you to do I don't care what
[11:42] somebody else says about the neighbors
[11:44] say well that person's lost her mind
[11:45] pray all alright
[11:46] they're either Bible I don't care what
[11:48] they say it's what God called you to do
[11:49] yeah that's right
[11:51] oh they say we can't have these ovations
[11:53] Pentecostal revival oh yes we can't do
[11:55] you can have it in yourself and you are
[11:58] the majority in God no matter what the
[12:01] rest of them think notice after in
[12:03] obedience this is close now after
[12:06] obeying God to his word when he
[12:08] fulfilled his mission that quickening
[12:11] power he received at Pentecost caught
[12:13] him away quick and his body miles and
[12:17] miles away he was taken in the spirit
[12:19] and was found over in another country
[12:22] somewhere quickening power of love and
[12:25] if we be Pentecostals that same power
[12:28] that raised up Jesus from the dead
[12:31] if if dwells in your mortal bodies all
[12:35] right Joris let's take another name of
[12:37] this quick new power
[12:38] there was a man way long ago by the name
[12:41] of Enoch when you think come on with
[12:45] something come along and say well that
[12:47] we have go back to the old school or
[12:48] this that the other
[12:49] Enoch walked with God whatever God said
[12:53] he never missed one word he walked with
[12:57] God what was it he was the son of God
[13:00] he wasn't evil and then called to that
[13:03] day and wouldn't come time he was so
[13:05] full of that quickening power if ever he
[13:07] walked 500 years or more before God and
[13:10] not one time had he missed his word not
[13:14] one time did he misbehave himself not
[13:17] one time did you but kept the testimony
[13:19] everything that God told he knew he
[13:21] wasn't done it no argument about he just
[13:23] wasn't done it no matter what anybody
[13:25] else thought he wasn't done it why he
[13:27] was full of that quickening power and
[13:29] when it comes time for the old man to
[13:30] die God is sitting on the ladder he
[13:32] walked up who he quickened him and took
[13:35] his mortal body up in a rapture hey
[13:40] that's that quickly power look at Elijah
[13:44] after his work was finished on earth he
[13:47] was so full that quickening power he
[13:49] condemned them Jackie Kennedy haircuts
[13:52] in his day he told Jezebel what he
[13:55] thought of her he told em preachers and
[13:57] priests one was right wrong and they
[13:59] didn't believe me but he condemned them
[14:00] painted face women taste so bad and he's
[14:03] so full of that quickly power to nothing
[14:05] to harm me God had been even my Hitler's
[14:08] stuck Enoch set him aside and he was so
[14:10] full of freakin power come time to die
[14:12] other Jordan both nothing he just walk
[14:14] or sit down a chair talking the who sold
[14:17] full of that quickening power he become
[14:19] a true genuine son of God
[14:23] notice he had a successor in his name
[14:27] was Elijah and Elijah had a double
[14:30] potion that's quick enough see he had a
[14:33] double potion of it now he preached for
[14:36] about eight years or he's got eighty
[14:38] years old he took sick and down now you
[14:41] didn't get to go home like Elijah did
[14:42] see both are
[14:44] they're in the church some Saints going
[14:47] some resting but notice when Elijah was
[14:50] taken up in the rapture then Elijah went
[14:55] to sleep and God pull acquit me power
[14:58] look at his prophecy just before he died
[15:02] now let me show you I don't care if
[15:04] you're her dad or where you're at that
[15:06] quickly power routines years and years
[15:12] after his death his meaning rotted away
[15:15] the skin worms did eat it up but they
[15:19] were packing a dead man one day
[15:21] Tony middleman bones that there was much
[15:23] quickening power that actually may come
[15:25] back to life again raising up from the
[15:31] dead because that quickening power there
[15:34] was a bone that sane of God never left
[15:37] he stayed on those bones all remember we
[15:41] are flesh of his flesh bone of his bones
[15:45] if we are his bride death won't bother
[15:49] that quickening power on though the skin
[15:52] worms destroy this body yet in my flesh
[15:55] shall I see God I don't want to say not
[16:04] a hope for an old man like me knowing I
[16:07] see my aunt and I understand as 56 years
[16:10] old you're kind of proclaim this but I
[16:14] know that in me nothing good that I have
[16:18] nothing I've done but in me is that
[16:21] quickening power it quickened me one day
[16:23] for the things of the world the eternal
[16:26] life all the things that's happened I've
[16:28] seen visions foretold things
[16:30] liver failure I spoke in other tongues I
[16:33] promise on I've done those things for
[16:36] the Spirit of God the talk to me that's
[16:38] quickly power I know that Sunday
[16:41] Larry neighbors living now and Sunday
[16:43] would he come these bones shall rise
[16:46] again do they fear me in the seat burn
[16:50] up where you ought to that quitting
[16:52] power is eternal
[16:55] I feel Easter right now yes sir I've had
[16:59] it for years it's in me it's in you if
[17:04] you the strain that raised Jesus from
[17:07] the dead dwells in your heart embodies
[17:09] its quicken you for the things of the
[17:11] world to the Word of God oh it's quicken
[17:15] you from this life - likely true
[17:17] you were once dead in sin and trespasses
[17:20] house now all being quickened together

[17:42] days of lot so will it be in the hours
[17:44] that the Son of Man will be revealed on
[17:47] earth not son of God the more son of man

[17:52] the last day when it evil will be flying

[18:09] when it come to sacrifice our the ox

[23:04] this aim
[23:07] company is happy to be in church this
[23:10] morning praise the Lord
[23:13] happy Easter Happy Easter I'm glad to be
[23:16] able to have church on Easter and I just
[23:20] want to mention that I try to sing songs
[23:24] that we all know and that we all have
[23:26] heard before so I trust I trust you all
[23:29] into these songs if not I apologize and
[23:31] you can always go on google and type in
[23:34] the names of the songs and they'll bring
[23:37] the lyrics up on Google and then you
[23:39] could sing along sing along as well as I
[23:41] said I try to try sing ones we know I
[23:43] like the one we're just saying I was
[23:45] listening to a tape the other day and
[23:47] brother branham was uh was singing this
[23:50] song and I remember he's saying it quite
[23:51] a bit and it uh it encouraged me because
[23:54] even not even just regarding this this
[23:56] time that we're in now but just in
[23:58] everyday life all the time Satan will
[24:00] just try to discourage us and when
[24:03] brother Bram started singing this song I
[24:04] just I was encouraged cuz despite what
[24:06] goes on you know we're bound for the
[24:08] promised land and we keep our eyes on
[24:09] the prize like that story brother
[24:11] branham told of the the boy riding the
[24:13] bike they asked how he made it across
[24:14] the law and how he made it across the
[24:16] board without falling off and he said he
[24:17] kept his eyes on the end and he just
[24:19] rode straight and if we could just do
[24:21] that
[24:21] we'll stay encouraged and we'll stay
[24:23] blessed every day despite what Satan
[24:25] throws our way so anyway let's I just
[24:28] wanted to read a scripture here with it
[24:29] being Easter morning this is John 11
[24:34] chapter 25 it says Jesus said unto her I
[24:38] am the resurrection and the life he that
[24:40] believeth in me though he were dead yet
[24:43] shall he live whosoever liveth and
[24:45] believeth in me shall never die believe
[24:47] us now this I'm so grateful for the
[24:50] sacrifice of the Lord it's just uh
[24:52] powerheads this morning as and as I
[24:54] always do I'll just invite you all to
[24:56] pray with me pray along with me but
[24:58] we'll just open up in prayer this
[24:59] morning Lord we love you and thank you
[25:02] for everything that you do there we
[25:04] thank you for the
[25:05] your sacrifice stored on the cross
[25:07] though we want to remember it this
[25:09] morning Easter morning Lord we want to
[25:10] remember the price that you paid Lord
[25:12] for our sins Lord we know back in in the
[25:15] Bible Time Lord when somebody was to
[25:17] commit a sin they would have to
[25:18] sacrifice an innocent and lamb in their
[25:20] place Lord but until your son came until
[25:23] you came in the flesh Lord and you gave
[25:25] your heart you gave your soul you gave
[25:27] your your everything Lord and you paid
[25:30] the price on that cross Lord so that we
[25:32] could have our sins paid for Lord an
[25:34] innocent sacrifice thorn we just want to
[25:37] thank you for that and back in the old
[25:39] time when they could when they kill the
[25:41] lamb in the place of their sin Lord it
[25:43] would it would take the sin away Lord
[25:44] but the it wouldn't be forgotten Lord
[25:46] but your sacrifice that you gave Lord
[25:48] not only took the sin away Lord but you
[25:51] put it in the sea of forgetfulness Lord
[25:53] he forgot you forgot about it Lord you
[25:56] justified us Lord there and we know
[25:58] we're unworthy Lord but because you
[26:00] deemed us worthy Lord you chose us and
[26:02] we just want to thank you for that Lord
[26:04] we love you Lord we appreciate you with
[26:07] all our hearts Lord may we not disgrace
[26:10] your sacrifice though we know that as
[26:12] your prophet said there's no longer sin
[26:14] anymore because you paid the price of
[26:16] sin on the cross Lord now it's unbelief
[26:18] Lord and we see ourselves Lord if we can
[26:21] believe on the sacrifice that you made
[26:22] Lord and apply it to our lives Lord we
[26:25] know that there is grace for us there's
[26:27] mercy for us with so many times Lord
[26:29] when we go back to sinful things Lord we
[26:32] just throw that sacrifice out Lord we
[26:34] ignore it because truly if we believed
[26:36] in it Lord we wouldn't do those things
[26:38] but Lord we just ask that you forgive us
[26:40] for our unbelief floor because that's
[26:42] what it is
[26:42] just like that man that received a
[26:44] pardon a pardon and brother Brandon told
[26:47] the story and and even though he had the
[26:48] pardon he didn't accept it as a pardon
[26:51] Lord and I believe it's similar to your
[26:53] sacrifice Lord you paid the price for
[26:56] our sin Lord but we still have to accept
[26:58] it and we have to apply it to our lives
[27:00] Lord forgive us for our unbelief Lord
[27:02] forgive us for where we struggle Lord
[27:04] and grow cold Lord it's not our desire
[27:06] but our desire in our heart is to live
[27:08] strong Lord lord I pray that you just
[27:11] touched us this morning Lord be in this
[27:13] service we pray Lord
[27:15] we love you and thank you for all things
[27:16] jesus name amen amen
[27:20] brother Mikey a couple announcements in
[27:25] praise Lord Church just wanted to make a
[27:27] few announcements first I wanted to just
[27:31] announce to the church that were
[27:32] streaming from a new location this
[27:33] morning last week where they was kind
[27:36] enough to open up his home to us but
[27:39] brother Paul has made an offer to us to
[27:41] use the fellowship hall and word of
[27:43] truth assembly here in Newton North
[27:44] Carolina and so so we're going to
[27:47] probably be using this as our home base
[27:49] at least for this time until God opens
[27:52] an opportunity for us to assemble
[27:53] together again at some location or the
[27:56] rapture comes first
[27:57] whichever takes place but but for the
[27:59] time being while we're doing streaming
[28:00] services we're gonna probably continue
[28:02] to use this location so I just want you
[28:04] to be being prayer for that and also be
[28:07] praying to bless brother Paul Stewart
[28:09] for his kindness to offers this location
[28:11] because it seems like it's gonna provide
[28:13] a good space and a good location for us
[28:14] to do that secondly I wanted to say that
[28:18] we're using a different platform this
[28:20] morning we're actually using YouTube
[28:21] live and this is a part of our effort to
[28:25] to streaming services we started out
[28:28] with GoToMeeting and there were some
[28:29] good things about us some things that
[28:31] weren't working so well but we're gonna
[28:32] try a different platform hopefully
[28:33] bringing a better streaming experience
[28:35] for the saints who are watching at home
[28:36] and and also we want to make the comment
[28:39] that we are new to this we do have some
[28:43] talented people brother Natan brother
[28:44] David who who have a lot more knowledge
[28:46] about these things and I do that's how
[28:48] we're able to get going this morning but
[28:50] if anybody has any advice any knowledge
[28:52] in these areas something that you can

[29:09] opportunity to chat to comment and place
[29:11] things up understand that there was
[29:13] times people were saying a man is some
[29:15] kind of things about the message which
[29:16] we certainly appreciate that but but
[29:18] also there's a a chat option on YouTube

[29:24] gmail account in order to use that
[29:26] feature so for those of you who are
[29:28] screaming if you do want to continue to

[45:12] grace and all things and Jesus Christ
[45:14] name Amen amen if you have your Bibles
[45:19] I'm invite to return me to the book of
[45:21] Romans chapter 4 Romans chapter 4 and
[45:24] we're gonna look at verse 17 Romans 4:17
[45:27] and
[45:30] and it reads this it says as it is
[45:33] written I have made thee a father of
[45:35] many nations before him whom he believed
[45:39] even God who quickeneth the dead and
[45:41] called it those things which be not as
[45:43] though they were portents hope believed
[45:46] in hope talking about Abraham now who
[45:48] against hope believed in hope that he
[45:50] had become the father of many nations
[45:53] according to that which was spoken so
[45:55] shall deceive be and being not weak in
[45:59] faith he considered not his own body now
[46:01] dead when he was about a hundred years
[46:03] old neither yet the deadness of Sarah's
[46:05] womb he's taken out the promise of God
[46:08] through unbelief but was strong in faith
[46:10] giving glory to God and being fully
[46:13] persuaded that what he promised not like
[46:15] this whatever God promised Abraham was
[46:19] persuaded that he was also able to
[46:22] perform and therefore it was imputed to
[46:26] him for righteousness and I was not
[46:28] rooting for his sake alone that it was
[46:30] imputed to him in other words it was
[46:32] able to impute something to that man the
[46:35] scripture is saying Paul is saying is
[46:37] he's not the only man that can be the
[46:39] benefit of this same righteousness if
[46:41] God could imputed to him under the law
[46:43] under bulls and goats I should say how
[46:45] much more could he imputed unto us under
[46:47] the blood of Christ he said it was not
[46:50] written for his sake alone that it was
[46:52] imputed but it but for us also to whom
[46:56] it shall be imputed if we believe on him
[47:00] that raised Jesus our Lord from the dead
[47:02] who was delivered for our offenses
[47:04] that's Calvary and was raised again for
[47:08] our justification that was that Easter
[47:11] morning let's bow our heads once again
[47:12] Heavenly Father we thank you for the
[47:14] reading of your work and Lord out of sex
[47:16] that she would take this time use the
[47:19] gift that you placed within me speak to
[47:21] your church
[47:22] help us Lord for we need you this
[47:24] morning in Jesus Christ's name we
[47:26] accident amen amen
[47:28] may be seated amen we'll see you at home
[47:30] again greet you in the name of our Lord
[47:32] Jesus Christ I like to this morning
[47:36] continue on where we left off last week
[47:38] with the message God's great achievement
[47:41] McCall is part two
[47:43] all still in the same series that we've
[47:45] been dealing in Norfolk route of Christ
[47:46] a mystery but this morning we want to
[47:49] take a little bit different angle and we
[47:51] want a background of course what we
[47:53] preached last week before we get into
[47:55] this morning service but we actually
[47:57] want to deal with it this morning in the
[47:58] way of the resurrection and in our
[48:01] scripture reading it says and being now
[48:04] we can faith this is from verse 19
[48:06] chapter 4 verse 19
[48:07] Paul writes here he Abraham Sitter not
[48:10] his own body now dead but is about a
[48:12] hundred years old neither yet the
[48:14] deadness of Sarah's womb it says he
[48:16] staggered not at the promise of God
[48:18] through unbelief but strong and faith
[48:21] giving glory to God and being fully
[48:23] persuaded what he had promised what God
[48:25] had promised he God was able also to
[48:28] perform and therefore it was imputed
[48:31] unto him for righteousness
[48:32] so Abraham's faith in God's Word
[48:36] actually was counted to him or imputed
[48:38] to him for righteousness
[48:39] verse 23 says now it was not written for
[48:41] his sake alone that it was imputed to
[48:43] him but for us also to whom it shall be
[48:46] imputed I love this it's a promise
[48:48] it shall being period a bit of them said
[48:50] as a condition of this it says if we
[48:52] believe on Him that raised up Jesus our
[48:55] Lord from the dead so all we need to
[48:56] have is impute the same faith that
[48:58] Abraham had that was to believe what God
[49:01] promised him if you and I could believe
[49:03] what God promised us the same
[49:05] righteousness and there was imputed
[49:06] Abraham that same right season again for
[49:09] our justification how was that body
[49:11] raised look at Acts chapter 4 verse 10
[49:14] scripture says being known until oh
[49:17] listen to you all and to all the people
[49:21] of Israel that by the name of Jesus
[49:23] Christ of Nazareth whom he crucified
[49:25] because of those Jews whom God raised
[49:28] from the dead
[49:29] so Christ the man headed for the dead
[49:31] that's the power that God is using to
[49:33] raise this body here in time now once
[49:35] you watch this so that body was raised
[49:38] by the power of God so today I want to
[49:41] talk about God's achievement because as
[49:43] holy as that body was as anointed that
[49:46] that body was as righteous that Jesus
[49:48] Christ was it still took God to raise
[49:51] that body so you and I will not achieve
[49:54] our goal by our righteousness we won't
[49:56] by our works it's going to take the
[49:58] grace of God and the power of God to
[50:00] confirm his power to raise this body as
[50:03] the word is promised for this day it
[50:05] won't be our achievement no more than
[50:07] Christ's success was his achievement his
[50:09] achievement was by the father operating
[50:11] inside the Sun and our team is gonna be
[50:14] about Christ operating inside the Brian
[50:16] I want you to watch this I want you to
[50:18] watch this last week we described how it
[50:20] was actually God's achievement and it
[50:23] was and we described what an achievement
[50:25] actually was an achievement as we
[50:28] described last week it was to
[50:30] successfully execute a goal a
[50:32] predetermined goal or objective that has
[50:35] been successfully fulfilled and last
[50:38] week we used the example of a man
[50:39] designed to be a millionaire and we said
[50:41] the bid be a million that was the desire
[50:43] that the man would have but even though
[50:45] he desired to be a millionaire I said if
[50:47] he would actually stumble into the money
[50:49] perhaps maybe about inheritance for my
[50:51] rich relative you didn't know about or
[50:52] maybe he might actually be in some type
[50:54] of accident or something and there was
[50:55] some predetermined goal and a plan to
[50:58] that goal first and to successfully
[51:00] execute the plan would define
[51:02] achievement but now the man might be
[51:03] blessed if somebody left him a million
[51:05] dollars or he got it by insurance or
[51:06] have you got it it might not be an
[51:08] achievement he might like it he got the
[51:09] money that's good but in order for it to
[51:11] be an achievement we've got to recognize
[51:13] there's got to be a goal established
[51:15] first and then when a person can
[51:17] successfully achieved the goal of their
[51:19] established then you can declare that to
[51:20] be an achievement and so we want to talk
[51:22] about God's achieving because God
[51:24] actually had a goal in mind before the
[51:26] foundation of the world and in order for
[51:28] to be God's great achievement God has to
[51:30] successfully by his own power by his own
[51:33] ability accomplish that goal so I wanted
[51:35] us look at the little things here God's
[51:36] achievement God had a goal and if God
[51:39] had a goal he had a vision and the
[51:41] vision was before the foundation of the
[51:42] world as we recognized by the message of
[51:44] the hour so what exactly was God's goal
[51:46] if we can see what God's goal was then
[51:50] we can evaluate what he has done and
[51:52] then we can determine whether or not he
[51:54] was successful in his achievement if you
[51:56] can see the goal and then you can see
[51:57] the results that you could say whether
[51:59] or not he was successful
[52:00] first of all God's goal or Bible tells
[52:03] us was a mystery and I say it with
[52:05] mystery because there was something that
[52:07] was hidden from the foundation of world
[52:08] but we recognize for the rest of the
[52:10] that it was revealed or promised to be
[52:12] revealed the last days in the seven
[52:14] seals brother Bentham says distant
[52:16] Christ of mystery God revealed about
[52:18] this about this achievement or his goal
[52:20] that God had in Christ of mystery
[52:22] brother BAM says this now God's great
[52:25] mystery he had before the world began
[52:27] how back in the back part of God's mind
[52:31] there was something listening that he
[52:33] was trying and going to achieve that's
[52:36] why I call this God's grace achievement
[52:38] because whatever to goal was did God had
[52:40] in a back part of his mind
[52:41] brother BEM said not only was he gonna
[52:43] try to he said but being God he can call
[52:45] those things that are not as though they
[52:47] were God had promised by his word I'm
[52:49] not gonna just try to achieve this goal
[52:51] thus saith the Lord I shall achieve this
[52:54] goal but we had to first recognize what
[52:56] that goal was and the secret was not
[52:58] going to be something that God was going
[52:59] to achieve what a man was gonna achieve
[53:01] or the church was gonna achieve but it
[53:03] was something that God was going to
[53:04] achieve and brother Branham said God had
[53:06] to started to do it because he said he
[53:08] knew knowing man and on all things
[53:10] beginning man is not capable ramsett of
[53:12] keeping a covenant he said so in order
[53:14] for God to achieve this goal he had to
[53:17] make the covenant unconditional it's not
[53:19] based upon what you do our revelation
[53:21] has to come quickened that our success
[53:23] is based upon what he's done and if we
[53:26] can see our success based upon his works
[53:28] then it takes the fear out of it because
[53:29] even in our failures we recognize God
[53:31] allows it for a purpose but he's still
[53:33] going to be glorified in the end because
[53:35] his promise that would be so God the
[53:38] Bible said he had a motive in doing it
[53:40] in other words he had a reason behind
[53:41] his goal and his motive was in order to
[53:44] let himself be expressed as so as we
[53:46] measure gaza achievement we had to
[53:48] measure on a basis of the reveal where
[53:50] the hour and a reveal say it were said
[53:52] his achievement was going to be in order
[53:54] that he might be expressed
[53:56] so his achievement would be the
[53:58] expression of himself now watching
[53:59] brother BAM says continue on Christ of
[54:00] mystery but a bam says the entire Bible
[54:03] is an expression of one goal had one
[54:06] purpose that he wanted to achieve in the
[54:08] entire Bible and all the acts of the
[54:11] believers in the Bible listen brother
[54:12] BAM says has been in tight so he said
[54:15] even though the entire Bible is an
[54:17] expression of one goal that God had
[54:19] brother Brown said these expressions
[54:21] that we see in the Old Testament in
[54:22] particular in many places in the Bible
[54:24] for the best that they have been in type
[54:25] listen and expressing what God's goal is
[54:28] so we read the Old Testament we see all
[54:30] these types of see all these shadows and
[54:32] yes they express God David express God
[54:34] Moses express God am Express God nature
[54:37] Express God we see God expressed in so
[54:39] many ways but brother BAM said these
[54:40] expressions were types of expressing
[54:42] what God's great goal really is so in
[54:45] his last day we have to be able to catch
[54:46] the real revelation not just the types
[54:49] but what was the fame behind the type
[54:51] that God really was after I want you to
[54:53] watch this and so with God in all things
[54:56] even the earth he created him for a
[54:58] purpose because express himself Christ
[55:01] misra God revealed but a bam says and
[55:02] all the accident believers in Harbor
[55:05] listen has been type expressing with
[55:07] God's holy us but now in this last day
[55:10] he has revealed it and he shows it so in
[55:13] our generation not only has God had this
[55:16] miss for his mind of what his ultimate
[55:17] goal he was trying to achieve was he had
[55:19] types but in this day he's not trying to
[55:22] express her type
[55:23] he's trying to express the fullness of
[55:24] what he had in a back part of his mind
[55:26] and it was revealed in the seals but I
[55:28] want you to watch this the seals
[55:29] actually had a two-fold manner to it in
[55:32] this sense even though the seals have
[55:35] been revealed revelation has a two-fold
[55:37] magnitude and it was just like Abraham
[55:39] when a Bible says Abraham was justified
[55:41] by faith that justification the Bible
[55:44] express had a two-fold manner to it
[55:46] brother branham priest of message one
[55:47] time call works is faith expressed and
[55:50] he said that Abraham he said Paul talked
[55:53] about Abraham being justified by faith
[55:55] but then he also said James looked at a
[55:58] James and they valid ID in the
[55:59] scriptures but it wasn't a battle
[56:01] between two men in that day it was
[56:03] actually two men having the same
[56:04] revelation from God but one talked about
[56:06] what God saw in Abraham and one talk
[56:08] about what man had an X on Abraham so
[56:10] even though God had revealed his word by
[56:13] the letter or by the spoken word to
[56:14] Abraham and when abraham believed it god
[56:17] saw his heart and imputed righteousness
[56:18] to him and said Abraham that you're
[56:20] justified by your faith yet death
[56:22] probable that same Bible said he was
[56:24] justified by believing in Romans chapter
[56:26] 4 that same Bible in Genesis 22 said
[56:29] that same God come down again and said
[56:31] Abraham now you're justified by your
[56:33] works and that's what James was
[56:34] preaching
[56:35] James and preaching however have acted
[56:37] at the garden
[56:38] about what he believed and with the
[56:40] overseers yes there's a revelation that
[56:42] comes by the open of the word but that's
[56:44] just part of the revelation we also now
[56:46] have to step into the manifestation with
[56:48] the reveal and that brings the
[56:49] revelation it's a full maturity not just
[56:51] a preaching of it but when there's a man
[56:53] that to believe it and act on what's
[56:55] been preached so I'll mention that the
[56:57] hour came to the opening of the word yes
[56:59] it's been open to us but now there's got
[57:01] to be a people like Abraham that can
[57:03] receive what's been open and actually
[57:05] act on what God has revealed and Abraham
[57:09] did it alone it wasn't savers job the
[57:11] ecto-1 abraham believed it wasn't the
[57:13] philistines job deck whatever him leave
[57:15] it was Abraham's job to act on what God
[57:17] had revealed to them and if we're a part
[57:19] of this message as individuals it's our
[57:22] job to act though what is God revealing
[57:24] to you now I want you to watch this
[57:26] twofold manner first the word is
[57:28] revealed by faith but then that faith
[57:31] has to move into a realm where it can
[57:34] manifest itself it works the same faith
[57:36] was expressed in the heart and there was
[57:38] expressed to the heart has been
[57:39] expressed expressed in the body in the
[57:41] actions so the second part we saw was
[57:45] God manifested and sort of misrata seals
[57:47] had the same two full manifestation
[57:49] first the opening of the revelation we
[57:51] heard it preached and we could say amen
[57:53] to that
[57:54] but now we're moving into a different
[57:55] season it's not just what's been
[57:58] preached it's what now is being made
[58:00] manifest now once you watch this like we
[58:04] said last week I was a fifty five God
[58:06] said that I'll not allow my word to
[58:08] return to me vol God will send that word
[58:11] to the earth by somebody but then
[58:13] there's got to be somebody to receive
[58:15] that what's been sent or you follow me
[58:17] now let me keep moving for fourth
[58:19] so God's great goal was to express
[58:21] himself and brother banister all the
[58:23] believers in the Bible has been in
[58:25] Tights Adam was a type he spreads God
[58:28] Abraham was a type he's pressed God
[58:31] wasn't was a type he's Prince God David
[58:33] was a type he expressed God or you
[58:35] follow me all these wood types but they
[58:37] only represented shadows of a greater
[58:39] one to come all were expressions but all
[58:43] were types of shadows but there was one
[58:46] that was coming that wasn't going to be
[58:48] a type of shadow see these types of
[58:50] shadows were only sign
[58:52] they were pointing to something else to
[58:54] come it's kind of like a brochure you
[58:56] know I'm not want to travel a whole lot
[58:58] you know people that travel a lot of
[58:59] exotic places and usually ones that
[59:01] maybe do a little bit not do financially
[59:03] but but I wouldn't mind sometime maybe
[59:07] traveling but you know you see some of
[59:09] these travel brochures and and and I've
[59:12] looked at these things that people have
[59:13] these timeshares and whatnot and they
[59:14] give you a book in it they say you know
[59:16] anywhere in the world you just flip the
[59:17] book and you can look at a Jamaica and
[59:20] you can look at the blue waters down in
[59:21] the Bahamas and then maybe you can look
[59:23] at the Niagara Falls and you can with
[59:26] all these places to go and the pictures
[59:27] are beautiful you're not betting the
[59:29] Grand Canyon and I've always seen
[59:31] picture of the Grand Canyon is a little
[59:32] child I said if I ever get a chance I
[59:33] want to go to Grand Canyon what about
[59:36] eight years ago I had a chance to go out
[59:37] to Arizona it's been several days and I
[59:39] was in Flagstaff and I said I found out
[59:42] Flagstaff was an hour-and-a-half drive
[59:43] from the Grand Canyon's I said I'm not
[59:45] getting this close without going to the
[59:46] Grand Canyon so I booked the extra day
[59:47] of my trip so that I took care of
[59:49] fishing business we were able to go out
[59:51] there and rather the Grand Canyon
[59:52] now I want to say this all these
[59:54] pictures were types the picture said
[59:58] this is what the Grand Canyon looked
[1:00:00] like I said wow look at the beautiful
[1:00:01] skies and look at the layers of colors
[1:00:04] in those rocks I said wow that's
[1:00:06] beautiful I want to go to the Grand
[1:00:07] Canyon and I got to the Grand Canyon out
[1:00:09] Halos pictures if he wanted to put him
[1:00:10] aside those photographs were types they
[1:00:14] represented the Grand Canyon but the
[1:00:17] Grand Canyon was so much greater than
[1:00:19] could ever be put in the photograph and
[1:00:20] that's the way God is God manifested
[1:00:23] himself in the old testament and types
[1:00:25] but when the real thing came in Jesus
[1:00:27] Christ who was not a type
[1:00:28] he was the fullness that with all those
[1:00:30] types represented he was so much greater
[1:00:32] David couldn't stand beside him John
[1:00:34] couldn't stand beside him Moses could
[1:00:36] have stammers how to rap
[1:00:37] he was so much greater and God's
[1:00:40] expression his full expression it's so
[1:00:43] much greater than any type and I want
[1:00:44] you to watch this
[1:00:45] so God wanted to express himself but a
[1:00:48] ma'am said express himself and types
[1:00:49] throughout the Bible he said but there
[1:00:51] was something greater that God wanted to
[1:00:52] express even greater than the types we
[1:00:55] could look at all those great men and
[1:00:56] all those great heroes what we call the
[1:00:58] faith but they were not the fullness of
[1:01:00] really what God had in his heart if you
[1:01:03] look at the matter of the book of
[1:01:04] Hebrews chapter
[1:01:05] on verse three you have to turn never
[1:01:07] read it to you real quick just to save
[1:01:08] time and Hebrews 1:1 it says God who in
[1:01:11] syndra times and in divers manners spake
[1:01:14] in time past unto the father's by the
[1:01:15] prophets now I want you to watch this it
[1:01:17] was God and the prophet speaking so
[1:01:20] those prophets were actually expressing
[1:01:22] God they were types but they were
[1:01:24] literally expressing attributes of God
[1:01:26] there was a king like him
[1:01:28] Abraham was a father like him are you
[1:01:29] follow me all these had types that they
[1:01:31] could express because it was God in them
[1:01:33] but it still was only a type now I want
[1:01:36] you watch this verse 2 and it says in
[1:01:38] and has entire and it has in his last
[1:01:40] days spoken to us not by the prophets
[1:01:42] but by his son whom he has appointed to
[1:01:45] be heir of all things
[1:01:46] there was no son or no property Old
[1:01:49] Testament that was a point of be the
[1:01:50] heir all things are you follow me there
[1:01:52] was only one that was appointed be there
[1:01:53] all things and that was when the
[1:01:54] anti-type come and that was Jesus Christ
[1:01:56] I would get a little ahead of myself
[1:01:57] even though they were wonderful anointed
[1:01:59] man and they were typed they were not
[1:02:01] appointed to be heirs but the Bride of
[1:02:03] Christ she is not a type she is the Ana
[1:02:05] type just like her Lord and she has been
[1:02:07] appointed in the world to come to be
[1:02:09] heir of all things I want you to watch
[1:02:12] this whom we apart of me err all things
[1:02:14] but whom also he made the world's who
[1:02:17] being in the brightness of his glory
[1:02:18] listen and Christ was the Express image
[1:02:21] of his person when you saw Christ you
[1:02:24] saw God not in part but all that God was
[1:02:27] was being expressed inside of that body
[1:02:28] are you follow me that's what Christ was
[1:02:30] so at the end of the Old Testament there
[1:02:33] was a climax of God's expression no more
[1:02:36] types but the fullness of what God was
[1:02:39] was walking on two feet upon the earth
[1:02:41] that's what was taking place in Christ
[1:02:43] not types any more like nature and moons
[1:02:46] and stars that could express them in the
[1:02:48] profits that could express them but one
[1:02:49] person one body in which God could
[1:02:52] express himself in his fullness now back
[1:02:54] in the message Christ a mystery God
[1:02:55] revealed but the brand it begins to
[1:02:56] bring this expression down in a real
[1:02:58] clear form now once you watch out a
[1:03:00] prophet words this he says therefore if
[1:03:02] any Trinitarian would just let yourself
[1:03:04] loose for a minute you can see that
[1:03:07] Father Son and the Holy Ghost is not
[1:03:09] three gods it's three attributes of the
[1:03:12] same God see its expression so when God
[1:03:15] said he wanted to express himself God
[1:03:18] desired to express himself
[1:03:19] his fullness and in the Fatherhood we
[1:03:21] find God express himself as a pillar of
[1:03:23] fire as a low cost and that logos was
[1:03:25] not God in part but it was God in his
[1:03:28] fullness and that was the first
[1:03:29] attribute of the Godhead and then we saw
[1:03:32] that that same Godhead was not a
[1:03:34] different person but now comes down as
[1:03:36] the Sun as a different attribute which
[1:03:38] means a different manifestation
[1:03:40] expressing the same person but the
[1:03:43] brother said it was like a man on a
[1:03:45] stage changing the mass he was one
[1:03:47] character but every time you went behind
[1:03:49] the scenes when he came back out he had
[1:03:50] a different mass but it was the same
[1:03:52] person and he said the trend of
[1:03:54] terrorists couldn't catch that so every
[1:03:56] time God changed his expression they
[1:03:58] thought it had to be a different person
[1:04:00] but brother Brown said it was not a
[1:04:01] different person it was the same person
[1:04:03] only changing his expression or the form
[1:04:07] of his expression and once you watch
[1:04:08] this he said its three attributes of the
[1:04:10] same God see its expression father he
[1:04:13] was though he wanted to be a father he
[1:04:16] was a father he was a son remem said and
[1:04:18] he is the Holy Ghost and the father a
[1:04:21] Holy Ghost is the same spirit don't you
[1:04:23] see don't you get it he said not three
[1:04:25] gods the devil has told you them things
[1:04:27] that try to make an idolatry out of you
[1:04:29] see it's one God expressed in three
[1:04:32] attributes so the father was the
[1:04:34] fullness of God the son was the fullness
[1:04:36] of God and when we use that title Holy
[1:04:39] Ghost the Holy Ghost is the same as the
[1:04:41] father so he has to be also the fullness
[1:04:43] of God and so when God put the Holy
[1:04:46] Ghost in the church what came down into
[1:04:48] the church it was God and his greatness
[1:04:49] coming down into his people with the
[1:04:52] promise that one day I will Stephanies
[1:04:53] people not in part but in my fullness of
[1:04:56] my glory that's the promise to the
[1:04:58] church and it's a promise for the
[1:04:59] endtime people now I want to take my
[1:05:01] time with this I want you to watch this
[1:05:02] so it was God revealed in the father the
[1:05:05] first attribute the fullness of God God
[1:05:08] revealed in the Sun and man still the
[1:05:10] second attribute but still the fullness
[1:05:12] of God and now God revealed the day in
[1:05:14] the Holy Ghost living in the people not
[1:05:17] less than God but still the fullness of
[1:05:19] God in the form of the Holy Ghost not in
[1:05:22] part but bringing God into perfection
[1:05:24] three expressions of the same person you
[1:05:29] see this hard for the the nominal church
[1:05:32] just
[1:05:33] except that the same as it was for the
[1:05:36] Jews to accept when Christ said I and
[1:05:38] the father was one they said we can
[1:05:40] accept you as a prophet we can accept
[1:05:42] you as a man with the healing ministry
[1:05:43] we can accept all these things I said
[1:05:47] before he said not for the works we
[1:05:49] don't stole you for that but for
[1:05:51] expressing a revelation that you and God
[1:05:53] are one
[1:05:53] that's more than our churches can handle
[1:05:55] and in his day is the same thing of the
[1:05:56] Gentiles when you really begin to get
[1:05:58] down to a God has accomplished and in
[1:06:00] the bride in his hour is hard for the
[1:06:02] nominal church world to accept that I
[1:06:04] want you to watch this so in the second
[1:06:07] person Christ the fullness of the
[1:06:09] godhead now in the last days in the
[1:06:11] bride he wants to express listen the
[1:06:13] same thing my brother BAM said Christ
[1:06:16] mr. got revealed I want to coast just a
[1:06:17] little bit so that even the people
[1:06:19] listen on the tape would get the idea he
[1:06:21] said that can see he said it would take
[1:06:24] me around the clock just with one of
[1:06:26] these subjects but I hope I'm making the
[1:06:28] clear enough that you can see what I'm
[1:06:30] coming to he said God expressed in
[1:06:32] Christ listen who was both Father Son
[1:06:35] and Holy Ghost the fullness of the
[1:06:37] Godhead bodily what he's trying to say
[1:06:39] when you got God in his fullness
[1:06:41] you've got the fullness of the Godhead
[1:06:42] or you follow me so in Christ he's not a
[1:06:46] second person he's a man with the
[1:06:49] fullness of one person living in him he
[1:06:52] said now the complete fullness of the
[1:06:53] Godhead bodily
[1:06:54] dwell in his church so that same father
[1:06:58] son Holy Ghost that manifested in Christ
[1:07:00] one God three attributes he said the
[1:07:02] same God is now I moved to the church I
[1:07:05] want to take my time with this he said
[1:07:07] God dwells in the full complete fullness
[1:07:09] of the Godhead bodily
[1:07:10] dwell in his church their preeminence
[1:07:12] 'as you said her brother Mike if he
[1:07:14] dwells in a church why are we not seeing
[1:07:16] the force express because then order to
[1:07:18] express his fullness he's got to have
[1:07:19] somebody that surrenders in there
[1:07:22] bonus reminisce mean there's nothing
[1:07:25] higher than that we had preached on this
[1:07:26] a couple weeks ago up in Conover and was
[1:07:28] showing that preeminence was a position
[1:07:30] and the position of preeminence is when
[1:07:31] Christ becomes the head when Christ
[1:07:33] becomes the head of a person's life not
[1:07:35] just something that new on Sundays not
[1:07:37] just something to do a couple of times a
[1:07:38] week but when everything your life
[1:07:40] centers around that one person how you
[1:07:42] talk how you act how you live how you
[1:07:44] fellowship how you conduct yourself with
[1:07:46] other people when your life centers
[1:07:48] around that and brother Malik said
[1:07:49] Christ become the center of all of your
[1:07:51] life then he has preeminence now he is
[1:07:53] the head because he's a center of all
[1:07:55] you say doing think the corners are
[1:07:57] message of the hour now wants to watch
[1:07:59] this that's preeminence all that God was
[1:08:02] he poured into Christ and all that
[1:08:03] Christ was is poured into the believers
[1:08:05] and we'll see that in manifestation once
[1:08:07] Christ has the preeminence in this body
[1:08:09] called the bride I want you to watch
[1:08:11] this now by launches we can do works but
[1:08:15] anointed Judas did works that's why by
[1:08:18] anointings we find a Baptist God
[1:08:20] healings we've got healings by anointing
[1:08:23] that raise the dead about knowing sin we
[1:08:25] raise the dead but I'm not talking about
[1:08:27] anointings in that fashion because the
[1:08:31] prophets had the anointings to raise
[1:08:32] dead but I'm talking about moving beyond
[1:08:35] just a type or expression I'm talking
[1:08:38] about the fullness of what that
[1:08:39] expression means that God himself now
[1:08:41] once you watch this so now what all this
[1:08:44] brother might you say you had an Easter
[1:08:45] message what does always have to do with
[1:08:46] Easter Easter represented God's
[1:08:50] achievement as I said it wasn't Christ
[1:08:54] that raised himself from the dead but
[1:08:56] the Bible said that the God that raised
[1:08:58] Jesus from the dead so God created a
[1:09:02] body God feel the body and then God
[1:09:05] raised the body and the bride is no
[1:09:07] different God has created the body God
[1:09:09] has filled that body and in his last
[1:09:11] days God has resurrected that body and
[1:09:13] that's what I want to focus on this
[1:09:15] morning I want to talk about how God has
[1:09:17] been expressed in a meeting in my body
[1:09:19] and how God has resurrected that body I
[1:09:22] want you to watch this for the message
[1:09:24] of rises on the Sun but the brem says
[1:09:26] not today we have it tuberculosis listen
[1:09:29] an Easter seal people who sends a
[1:09:32] message out to one another and support
[1:09:35] this great fun
[1:09:36] or drive for the doctors medical science
[1:09:38] to work upon something to or to
[1:09:41] help the tuberculosis they are they are
[1:09:44] sealed
[1:09:45] he said what we call an Easter seal
[1:09:48] he said when we send message one to
[1:09:50] another he said but when we received the
[1:09:52] message now listen to the Prophet he's
[1:09:54] talking in tights but I want you to
[1:09:55] catch what he says but when we received
[1:09:57] the message he said the seal is broken
[1:09:59] because the seal has got a message a
[1:10:02] message bound on the inside so in every
[1:10:06] age God has broken a seal why because
[1:10:08] every age brother brems had had a seal
[1:10:10] because behind the seal was the message
[1:10:12] for that age and when God broke the seal
[1:10:14] the message of free age caught the
[1:10:15] message of the revelation and took it to
[1:10:17] the people but once the seal has been
[1:10:19] broken it releases whatever the mystery
[1:10:21] was or the message behind that seal if I
[1:10:24] were to send you will see a brother
[1:10:25] David I said you will see a brother Abel
[1:10:27] I might say something different but they
[1:10:28] haven't been able I appreciate your song
[1:10:30] service I might say brother David I
[1:10:31] appreciate your help on the equipment
[1:10:33] and yet both of them are still there the
[1:10:34] same envelope they look the same
[1:10:36] the sealing outsides are saying but the
[1:10:38] message is based upon the one that is
[1:10:40] directed to and when that person opens
[1:10:42] that seal he sees what was on my heart
[1:10:44] regarding him and what was on God
[1:10:46] Horsell garden in stage it's greater
[1:10:48] than what's on God heart regarding your
[1:10:49] age and God has broken the seventh seal
[1:10:53] mystery to you and I and I job is to
[1:10:55] take that she'll let when God has opened
[1:10:57] that seal and see what the message was
[1:10:59] he had on the other side and then like
[1:11:02] Abraham would have believed that message
[1:11:04] but I want you to watch this brem says
[1:11:06] it now the true Easter seal he said on
[1:11:09] this sunrise was broken he's speaking of
[1:11:12] two thousand years ago after Calvary and
[1:11:14] the secret listen the secret of life
[1:11:18] after death was revealed before that
[1:11:21] time we didn't know now I want you to
[1:11:23] compare what happened 2,000 years ago to
[1:11:25] what's happening now the mystery of God
[1:11:27] according to revelations 10 7 listen has
[1:11:30] been revealed and it reveals something
[1:11:32] that prior to that still being broken we
[1:11:34] did not know and brother Brandon said me
[1:11:36] and had often wondered even Jobe said
[1:11:38] what happens to a man had to die shall
[1:11:40] he be like a tree shall he live again
[1:11:42] Joe being a prophet by being a prophet
[1:11:44] it was sealed a mystery like of the
[1:11:46] death but brother
[1:11:47] after the resurrection it was no more
[1:11:50] mystery we saw how a man can live just
[1:11:52] like you live but man can walk just like
[1:11:54] you walk a man can eat just like you and
[1:11:56] I eat and that man could actually die
[1:11:58] like every other man ain't going a grave
[1:12:00] but three days later that makes I walk
[1:12:02] out again that it never happened through
[1:12:04] the history of the Bible they had been
[1:12:06] body changes they have been
[1:12:07] resurrections in terms of a man falling
[1:12:09] down and getting up but never a man
[1:12:10] going in there and be in the three days
[1:12:12] and coming back out alive again like he
[1:12:14] did you said brother Mike you said
[1:12:16] Lazarus came up again I said last word
[1:12:18] back down that was not the same kind of
[1:12:20] death
[1:12:21] those that had raised before that from
[1:12:24] the dead every one of them had to go
[1:12:26] back to the grind to death they come out
[1:12:28] of well Jesus Christ had a different
[1:12:30] resurrection he said I live and I shall
[1:12:33] never die anymore it was a different
[1:12:35] kind of resurrection
[1:12:36] it showed that a man that had lived had
[1:12:39] conquered death him the grave and the
[1:12:41] power same to the brow said stains
[1:12:43] trinitario powers had no longer hole
[1:12:45] upon him and the bride is going to
[1:12:47] experience that while she's alive or two
[1:12:49] feet walking her she's gonna
[1:12:52] have a quick attendees that's gonna have
[1:12:54] a victory over Satan and that's will
[1:12:56] have no power over Satan will have no
[1:12:58] hold on her but she's gotta believe the
[1:13:00] message now behind that seal that said
[1:13:02] you are the people and you are in that
[1:13:03] age are you follow me but we can hear
[1:13:08] this message and we can save and we
[1:13:11] believe certain things about it
[1:13:12] but brother Bama said I don't think we
[1:13:13] had the sincerity about what we're
[1:13:15] confessing we haven't come to the
[1:13:17] revelation of it actually what God has
[1:13:19] revealed and has accomplished in his age
[1:13:21] you said accomplish brother Mike what
[1:13:24] was the brother branham oh he was the
[1:13:25] example of what a man redeemed in Christ
[1:13:29] can look like I want to hold it you say
[1:13:33] was a prophet he sure was he was a son
[1:13:36] of man - on a man in ministry but people
[1:13:40] get mixed up and adopted son versus a
[1:13:44] son of man some of his anointing was son
[1:13:48] of man some of his anointing was a
[1:13:51] doctor son and people get those two
[1:13:53] things mixed up I'm not trying to be a
[1:13:55] son of man but the seals have a real to
[1:13:58] me I'm living to age and what is my
[1:14:00] expectation to be an adopted son and
[1:14:02] anything shorter in the same shows I
[1:14:05] haven't come to the revelation of what
[1:14:07] was sealed behind that message that was
[1:14:09] the message this is the age of the
[1:14:11] adoption I want to keep going you said
[1:14:14] brother Michael Thor was in Asia rapture
[1:14:15] the rapture is the manifesto of that
[1:14:18] adopted body because if you look at
[1:14:20] Romans 8 is said that the sons of God
[1:14:22] that should be manifested say I received
[1:14:25] the redemption of their mortal bodies
[1:14:27] that's a body change or you follow me
[1:14:30] the sons of God his age we're looking
[1:14:33] for a body change let me keep reading
[1:14:35] program said the secret of life and
[1:14:38] death was revealed before that time we
[1:14:40] didn't know the world group groped in
[1:14:42] darkness
[1:14:43] he says group around me and suspicion
[1:14:46] listen theories that was amongst man's
[1:14:49] heart traditions made up now I want you
[1:14:53] to catch the prophets in here they knew
[1:14:55] that there were God but they had ideas
[1:14:57] of their own in terms of who he was and
[1:15:00] what was his mystery they couldn't catch
[1:15:02] his mystery was expression and I want to
[1:15:05] say this that expression was God wanted
[1:15:08] to express himself even in the message I
[1:15:12] find that that thought is still a
[1:15:14] mystery
[1:15:14] God doesn't want you brother Brian to
[1:15:17] express him
[1:15:18] you can't God doesn't want brother Mike
[1:15:22] to express him
[1:15:23] I cannot there's only one that can
[1:15:27] express God and that's where the brem
[1:15:30] said when he interprets his word and
[1:15:31] brother Bram said no man has the right
[1:15:34] to interpret his word is subject to no
[1:15:35] private interpretation he said God is
[1:15:38] his own interpreter so if God's gonna
[1:15:41] express himself in brother Mike there's
[1:15:43] only one way this mystery can happen is
[1:15:45] God has to step into brother Mike and
[1:15:48] then God has to express himself in
[1:15:50] brother Mike or you follow me and under
[1:15:54] the seal it just told us and
[1:15:55] particularly how God wants to express
[1:15:58] himself in brother Mike are you
[1:15:59] following I want you to keep going
[1:16:01] he said and said they had theories in
[1:16:03] their heart traditions made of man
[1:16:04] worship idols they worship the Sun they
[1:16:07] worship all kinds of God he said all
[1:16:09] kinds of people that made claims he said
[1:16:11] they all went into the grave and they
[1:16:13] stayed in the grave
[1:16:15] Muhammad said he's gonna resurrect the
[1:16:18] live and never died no more and they've
[1:16:20] been waiting over a thousand years and
[1:16:22] he's still changing horses wait for word
[1:16:24] happy didn't take Christ that long
[1:16:26] Christ said in less than three days our
[1:16:29] res again why because the Bible said in
[1:16:31] David said that he'll not suffer his
[1:16:33] Holy One to see corruption
[1:16:34] and but I'm said corruption sets in and
[1:16:36] said in 2 hours it didn't take him three
[1:16:38] days to confirm his word he made the
[1:16:40] promise and unless the three days God
[1:16:42] confirmed the man was true in what he
[1:16:44] said and the show did that other
[1:16:45] person's false
[1:16:46] there's stay away for a resurrection and
[1:16:48] it hadn't come yet and it won't happen
[1:16:50] until our third millennium is over and
[1:16:52] there's a great resurrection and he
[1:16:53] arises to be judged as a liar for
[1:16:56] claiming he was something that he was
[1:16:57] not but brother Graham said Christ was
[1:16:58] different he made a claim of who he was
[1:17:00] and he proved who he was and the Brian
[1:17:03] and his resurrection we've been making a
[1:17:05] claim that we're at different people
[1:17:07] we've been making a claim that our
[1:17:08] message is different now it's time for
[1:17:10] the bride to change her season and she
[1:17:12] has to express or manifest what she's
[1:17:14] claimed to be
[1:17:15] I want you to watch this but the Bremen
[1:17:19] says the real steel had been broken and
[1:17:22] the one who once lived as we lived died
[1:17:25] as we will die was risen from the dead
[1:17:27] he said water morning never one like it
[1:17:30] never a morning like as you follow me in
[1:17:32] that history of the world
[1:17:34] he said secret was made known that he
[1:17:37] was both action now listen he had proven
[1:17:40] Lazarus he was the resurrection but now
[1:17:44] he's proved he's the life brother Brahim
[1:17:46] said he had proved he was a resurrection
[1:17:47] but now he proved his resurrection and
[1:17:49] life now I want you to get this what do
[1:17:53] you mean life for the my car he was a
[1:17:55] life without in that death could not
[1:17:59] hold Moses was a life those trees that
[1:18:04] they got life he was a different life he
[1:18:08] was little a man expressing the life of
[1:18:10] God what'd he get Ember the mic the
[1:18:14] mystery behind the seal was that God was
[1:18:17] able to express himself in man not in
[1:18:22] types but the person himself and what is
[1:18:26] the message the hour came to bring us
[1:18:28] back to that original revelation Paul
[1:18:32] preaches no longer I that liveth listen
[1:18:34] to me Christ in me we can't change our
[1:18:41] bodies we can be kind to our brother
[1:18:47] psychology can teach you that we can
[1:18:50] learn to go to church on Sundays and pay
[1:18:52] our tithe tradition can teach you that
[1:18:56] we can even learn their brother
[1:18:58] Brennan's of Prophet scripture can
[1:19:01] explain that that's none of that is
[1:19:05] expression are you follow me but the
[1:19:08] mystery of the Resurrection showed that
[1:19:11] a man that said that he was God in flesh
[1:19:14] I come from God
[1:19:16] listen Church I go back to God and he
[1:19:20] did it
[1:19:20] a man that could say
[1:19:22] destroy this temple and in three days
[1:19:24] I'll raise it up again
[1:19:25] he didn't just make the promise he did
[1:19:29] it I want you to catch this the same man
[1:19:33] that made those promises and did it said
[1:19:37] as I live
[1:19:38] listen he made another promise you shall
[1:19:41] live also if he lived by an endless life
[1:19:46] and that endless life was able to
[1:19:49] express God in the way they did he said
[1:19:52] I'm making another promise it's not up
[1:19:55] to you to achieve it you didn't make the
[1:19:57] promise I'm making the promise and if I
[1:20:01] could back up that promise does it not
[1:20:04] have the power to back up that promise
[1:20:06] you see Abraham when he heard God's
[1:20:08] promise even when his body was dead he
[1:20:12] didn't say well maybe I misunderstood
[1:20:14] maybe I don't have the real understand
[1:20:17] the revelation of what he meant he
[1:20:19] looked at the promise and said he would
[1:20:22] not have said it to me if he couldn't do
[1:20:25] it that's how we had to see the message
[1:20:28] this message would not have been
[1:20:30] preached to you this message God would
[1:20:32] not have preached it to me this message
[1:20:34] God would not have sent it to this world
[1:20:36] if he didn't have every intention to
[1:20:39] achieve what he preached not in some
[1:20:43] phones in every phone not one letter not
[1:20:46] one word not one iota can pass away
[1:20:49] until God has achieved everything that
[1:20:51] he preached and that was the faith of
[1:20:53] Abraham and the Bible said that we must
[1:20:55] had to fade the Abraham and that was the
[1:20:57] mind of Christ when brother Branham said
[1:20:59] he wasn't a great he had one scripture
[1:21:00] thou should not suffer that hold of RC
[1:21:02] corruption he said he knew that God had
[1:21:04] to achieve a resurrection because he may
[1:21:06] have promised and he said we've got more
[1:21:08] than one scripture we got a retired head
[1:21:10] of a Bible that points to this last day
[1:21:12] to stand up and say God you promised and
[1:21:14] we're the age and we're the people and
[1:21:16] Lord I'm expecting you to fulfill that
[1:21:18] promise are you seeing where we're
[1:21:21] standing
[1:21:22] we're the seeds of Abraham with the
[1:21:24] truth of Abraham by a new birth in Jesus
[1:21:27] Christ and that same faith by a new
[1:21:29] birth where the brother said pushing you
[1:21:30] to faith Abraham had it puts on you the
[1:21:33] faith of Christ had
[1:21:35] pushing you the faith that God had when
[1:21:37] God said let there be
[1:21:38] he didn't doubt for one minute what was
[1:21:40] going to happen I want you to watch I'm
[1:21:45] gonna close you in a minute
[1:21:46] but I'm trying to show you something
[1:21:48] Christ's resurrection what it
[1:21:50] represented to you and I it showed that
[1:21:53] there was an endless life that once
[1:21:55] dwelt in flesh and that same in his life
[1:21:57] God promised that he was going to give
[1:21:59] to another people and our job is not to
[1:22:02] be two believers look as a message that
[1:22:04] makes us a theologian that makes us
[1:22:06] nozzle about the word but God didn't
[1:22:08] call us to be a theologian but he did
[1:22:09] call you to know what you believe we
[1:22:11] should understand why we believe this
[1:22:13] message that's why we move when things
[1:22:15] begin to shake laughs something in you
[1:22:17] said Lord I can't let this message go I
[1:22:18] got to keep moving why something he was
[1:22:21] yearning for the expression of that
[1:22:23] resurrection the disciples expressed
[1:22:27] healing they expressed preachers but out
[1:22:29] of their Pentecost they express the
[1:22:31] resurrection you see a resurrection
[1:22:33] Jesus Christ that I have made you
[1:22:34] witnesses what does it mean I made you
[1:22:36] witnesses not just go back and tell me
[1:22:38] what I did when you walk with me three
[1:22:39] and a half years he said but I rose
[1:22:41] again and you had to be a witness a
[1:22:43] witness means you have your old
[1:22:45] testimony of the facts nobody had to
[1:22:48] tell me
[1:22:49] I've got my old testimony of what took
[1:22:51] place and I was not there in this body
[1:22:54] 2,000 years ago but brother brown said I
[1:22:56] was there is dead body 2000 years ago
[1:22:59] and when that body rolls where the
[1:23:01] family said I rose with it and when it
[1:23:03] died I got with it and so therefore I
[1:23:05] can't be judged of our sins but able
[1:23:07] because I was judged in that body and
[1:23:09] that's got to be a personal revelation
[1:23:13] and so when that body rose if that body
[1:23:17] listen church is dead body was justified
[1:23:20] and it's raising even with all the sins
[1:23:23] of the world dumped on it my sins your
[1:23:27] sins if God by the resurrection to make
[1:23:30] that body so white that it can stand in
[1:23:34] a white throne judgment and judge every
[1:23:37] sinner because he was kind of
[1:23:39] righteousness and if I died with that
[1:23:41] body brother Brian and I resurrected
[1:23:43] with that body gets this when I stand to
[1:23:45] the right throne judgment I'll stand in
[1:23:47] the same righteous wife
[1:23:48] because the Bible said what he was was
[1:23:50] imputed unto me I didn't earn it I just
[1:23:55] believed by the message that is my
[1:23:57] rights by divine inheritance and in a
[1:24:01] mystery our brother Graham said instead
[1:24:02] an inalienable right which means of God
[1:24:04] promised it to you sister nothing can
[1:24:06] take it away not even yourself shall I
[1:24:10] believe him to God no way
[1:24:12] yeah because God made the promise and
[1:24:15] it's his promise he's protecting natural
[1:24:17] righteousness for Sailor mr. and Abraham
[1:24:22] mister why did God accept him anyway it
[1:24:24] wasn't those people he was protected it
[1:24:26] was a promise he made to a man and God
[1:24:30] promised Christ he's gonna give him a
[1:24:31] bride and before the finest world
[1:24:33] brother Brian God promised you he will
[1:24:35] give you a new body and then some
[1:24:36] promise he's protecting but do we
[1:24:38] actually believe in the promise then if
[1:24:40] we do live for the promise how do those
[1:24:44] disciples believed the promise they
[1:24:46] stayed in the up room - they got it
[1:24:48] their actions showed they were expecting
[1:24:51] something to take place what I'm afraid
[1:24:53] of
[1:24:54] sometimes looking on a message I look at
[1:24:57] lots of people the David I wonder what
[1:24:59] to expect I'm watching lives how they're
[1:25:03] acting and I'm saying what are you
[1:25:05] expecting
[1:25:06] I'm watching my life what am I expecting
[1:25:10] if I see that the prompt the promise was
[1:25:12] that before the going home the bride
[1:25:15] Christ will come back according to
[1:25:17] second Thessalonians chapter one Christ
[1:25:19] will come back to be glorified in his
[1:25:21] Saints but the Bremen said not in part
[1:25:23] but he steps out of heaven in the
[1:25:26] fullness of his glory to be manifested
[1:25:28] in his fullness I've got a message I'm
[1:25:30] working on that his fullness was not
[1:25:34] just faith that's an attribute of divine
[1:25:37] nature not just patience that's the
[1:25:41] attribute of divine nature not just
[1:25:43] temperance and godliness or in brotherly
[1:25:46] kindness those are attributes of divine
[1:25:47] nature but our age is supposed to
[1:25:49] express a capstone the capstone is love
[1:25:53] and love is God himself all the love
[1:25:58] that God had in him
[1:26:00] was manifested in Christ when he died
[1:26:02] for the sins of the world and all the
[1:26:04] love of God that was in Christ it's not
[1:26:07] only made manifest in us I'm not looking
[1:26:09] to manifest part of his divine nature
[1:26:12] I'm looking for God in the fullness of a
[1:26:15] divine nature or you follow me because I
[1:26:18] see what was open behind that seal in
[1:26:21] God said brother Mike this is what I'm
[1:26:22] calling you to and I see right away I
[1:26:25] don't have the ability but his mortal
[1:26:28] flesh and blood to get there Abraham
[1:26:32] with his body and said my buddy's dead
[1:26:33] well guess what our bodies a day but the
[1:26:37] Bram said God didn't redeem or when you
[1:26:39] received the Holy Spirit your body was
[1:26:41] not redeemed your soul was redeem this
[1:26:44] body still dead
[1:26:45] Paul said I wrestled with this body or
[1:26:48] if Richard man that I am but I and this
[1:26:51] age have a confidence the same promise
[1:26:53] that said he can change my nature said
[1:26:56] he can also change my body and I'm
[1:26:58] looking for my nature to match that
[1:27:00] capstone of love and by the that nature
[1:27:03] that power will also quicken this mortal
[1:27:06] body let me get on because I'm taking
[1:27:07] too long let me get on turn it a little
[1:27:10] bit occurs if you have your Bibles
[1:27:11] Leviticus 23 I'm gonna hit a couple
[1:27:13] things I don't let you go I'm just
[1:27:15] trying to show us Church what was the
[1:27:18] significance of that resurrection and
[1:27:20] what the denominations to loss Paul when
[1:27:23] he preached to the Galatians when Paul
[1:27:25] preached to the Corinthians and Paul
[1:27:27] preaches you know other churches he hid
[1:27:29] this fact Paul total Galatians that they
[1:27:33] actually were preaching a different
[1:27:36] gospel God told the Corinthians they
[1:27:41] were preaching different Christ or you
[1:27:43] follow me what was he trying to say he
[1:27:46] was trying to say the original
[1:27:48] revelation of the church was revealed on
[1:27:52] the day of Pentecost and when you see
[1:27:54] how that Holy Ghost operated in that
[1:27:56] church there was a book of Acts written
[1:27:58] behind it so Paul was trying to tell
[1:28:00] them the churches you're still calling
[1:28:03] on the name but you're not living the
[1:28:05] life that the name represents so that
[1:28:08] made them preach the different not be an
[1:28:10] imitation of Christ my life would not be
[1:28:12] an imitation of Christ
[1:28:13] our lives will not be
[1:28:14] Laozi what we believe but our life would
[1:28:16] be that same life that resurrected again
[1:28:18] in you and modern-day witnesses that
[1:28:21] that resurrection happened 2,000 years
[1:28:23] ago brother BAM said how by approving a
[1:28:27] new resurrection in his day this is
[1:28:28] where I want to close our life has to be
[1:28:32] to be translated in the bride before we
[1:28:36] leave to be like email to fulfill the
[1:28:38] type we have to have a testimony Enoch
[1:28:42] had a testimony that he pleased God how
[1:28:45] by expressing God to that generation and
[1:28:48] before we have a body changed we've got
[1:28:51] to have the testimony left behind that
[1:28:53] in this generation what did God do in
[1:28:55] your life went into a mind he expressed
[1:28:57] himself in you in this generation and in
[1:28:59] order to know if he's achieved that you
[1:29:01] got to know what that expression is and
[1:29:04] as much as I love this message it's more
[1:29:08] than saying I believe this message and
[1:29:11] that's what both of my hungers for you
[1:29:13] said but my own healing I've had him my
[1:29:16] ministry a number of them you know had
[1:29:18] to go around to everybody what they are
[1:29:19] but you pray for people people get
[1:29:21] healed last time we were up and I
[1:29:23] believe it was Virginia we had a service
[1:29:24] and they were sitting office time before
[1:29:26] that I'm sorry wasn't last month was
[1:29:27] month before that there was seven people
[1:29:28] came up we have prayer form
[1:29:31] morning service same prayer pray for one
[1:29:34] pray for each one of them in game the
[1:29:35] same promise same prayer st. promise but
[1:29:38] one of the sisters that came up we had
[1:29:40] prayer where she came back to me at the
[1:29:41] service and said when I got back to my
[1:29:43] seat God had already healed me of what I
[1:29:45] came up a prayerful
[1:29:45] because it was something of pain she
[1:29:47] could feel in my body or you follow me
[1:29:49] now why didn't everyone of them come
[1:29:52] back you see Scripture how you follow me
[1:29:55] but she came back and she said thank you
[1:29:57] for praying for me when I don't take no
[1:29:59] credit for that I'm just an instrument
[1:30:01] like all your to do the same thing but
[1:30:03] the point I'm making is this healings is
[1:30:05] not what I'm asked to do I love to see
[1:30:07] more healings preaching I'm not there's
[1:30:12] many of my there that I wouldn't want to
[1:30:14] preach after their preachers but
[1:30:18] preaching is not what I'm after
[1:30:20] those things are expressions but that's
[1:30:23] not expression I'm after
[1:30:26] after the expression that the word has
[1:30:27] promised for my age and when I look at
[1:30:31] brother Mike compared to that I don't
[1:30:34] want to lower that level I want to keep
[1:30:36] it right with God placed it and let my
[1:30:38] face at God and move me up move me up
[1:30:41] move me up or you follow me now I want
[1:30:44] you to watch this and we get ready to
[1:30:45] close Leviticus 23 verse 9 but I barely
[1:30:47] use this in the message of rising the
[1:30:48] Sun and it says and the Lord spake unto
[1:30:51] Moses saying speak unto the children of
[1:30:52] Israel and say unto them when ye be
[1:30:55] coming to the land which I give unto you
[1:30:57] and shall reap the harvest thereof then
[1:31:02] ye shall bring a sheaf of the first
[1:31:04] fruits of your harvest unto the priest
[1:31:06] now of course he's talking about harvest
[1:31:08] time but partner if interrupting the
[1:31:10] scripture reading but God brought a
[1:31:12] thought back to me to get him in this
[1:31:13] moment and I just want to share it why
[1:31:17] someone thing he shared it to people let
[1:31:19] the church on the screaming to forgive
[1:31:21] me if ignoring the camera I got faces he
[1:31:23] looking at me
[1:31:26] God spoke about I believe it was him I
[1:31:29] believe it was him this morning he said
[1:31:32] God and you does not make him weaker if
[1:31:38] I were to take water and pour it in
[1:31:42] Pepsi Cola oh I take the cue me Pepsi
[1:31:45] Cola and pour it in the water that's a
[1:31:48] better example
[1:31:49] Pepsi gets weaker in the water becomes
[1:31:53] one but the water dilutes the effect of
[1:31:57] the Pepsi or whatever so do you pour in
[1:32:00] it but God's not so God's power is
[1:32:05] greater than you or I when God pours his
[1:32:09] power into a man's heart he doesn't
[1:32:12] dilute his power by mixing with the man
[1:32:14] the man has to die in order that God
[1:32:17] might be greater so God in me does not
[1:32:21] weaken God but listen but me and God
[1:32:25] strengthens me or you follow me when God
[1:32:29] comes in to me he doesn't get any weaker
[1:32:31] but when I get into Christ I get
[1:32:35] stronger
[1:32:37] and that's got to be a revelation we're
[1:32:41] in Christ and the life of Christ doesn't
[1:32:45] get weaker but you in that life is
[1:32:47] making you the more you eat this word it
[1:32:49] should be making you stronger now I want
[1:32:54] you to watch this and the harbor's
[1:32:59] thereof then shall you bring a sheaf of
[1:33:02] produce of your harvest into the cheap
[1:33:04] up to the pipe freeze now when they
[1:33:06] bring it to the priest those who may not
[1:33:08] be streaming the wave sheaf offering I
[1:33:10] brother Stengel he could really do just
[1:33:12] as it is but I'm oh I'm oh highlight it
[1:33:13] maybe one day he'll preaching and you'll
[1:33:14] get the other side of it the restaurant
[1:33:16] looks like the rest of it but with the
[1:33:18] wave sheaf there was a feel out there
[1:33:21] and I'm just going to use it internally
[1:33:23] understand let's say 200 acres maybe the
[1:33:27] man might have 400 they had more land
[1:33:29] maybe to work with then we have Randy
[1:33:32] cities but on all these acres I want you
[1:33:34] to watch this he might had acres and all
[1:33:37] those acres they were thousands upon
[1:33:40] thousands of heads of wheat and that
[1:33:45] farmer had to watch that crop to whole
[1:33:49] crop to see which head comes to maturity
[1:33:52] first that mean it's ready to be
[1:33:55] harvested which means if the first one
[1:33:58] comes to maturity then that tells you
[1:34:00] what season you're living in you know
[1:34:02] even harvest time why because there's
[1:34:04] something ready to be harvested and so
[1:34:08] when you find that first hair that comes
[1:34:10] of maturity that has the ripeness you
[1:34:13] want that has the health you are not
[1:34:15] there's a little limp or a little little
[1:34:16] stubble looking you don't pick that one
[1:34:18] you let that you let you just cut that
[1:34:20] down and throw it away because this it's
[1:34:21] ready burn but you find one that's
[1:34:23] healthy that looks like the original
[1:34:25] crop that went into the ground you said
[1:34:27] now that's what I planted and that's
[1:34:30] what I've been waiting for and so
[1:34:33] according to this prophecy without ready
[1:34:35] of Leviticus I'm going to read the rest
[1:34:36] of it but a Branham use it as a type or
[1:34:38] a shadow to point to the real
[1:34:41] fulfillment of the prophecy and price
[1:34:44] was the real fulfillment want you to
[1:34:46] watch this now when that man plucks that
[1:34:48] head of wheat he goes to the priest as
[1:34:50] this is the first fruit of maturity at
[1:34:53] all my work this farming season this is
[1:34:57] what I plant and this is what I've been
[1:34:59] waiting on and then a high priest
[1:35:01] examines it and then he blesses it and
[1:35:03] then he weighs it before God
[1:35:05] they said God we thank you for giving
[1:35:07] this man this crop we thank you for
[1:35:10] bringing his farm to maturity and we
[1:35:12] thank you for the rest of his head
[1:35:13] coming to the same position may I bless
[1:35:17] the entire crop you come to the same
[1:35:20] position and what God did in Christ when
[1:35:25] Christ compete in the book of Acts
[1:35:26] before those disciples before Pentecost
[1:35:29] why did he have to come back talk to
[1:35:31] them because he had to prove that
[1:35:33] resurrection was successful and God has
[1:35:36] accepted him as a resurrection and then
[1:35:39] God lifted up that Christ right in front
[1:35:41] of disciples listen in front of them and
[1:35:43] waved it over the disciples and you see
[1:35:45] what I deal with this man you shall have
[1:35:47] the same life do you receive what he had
[1:35:54] he was the wave sheaf and every believer
[1:35:57] the trench ages had to have a portion of
[1:36:00] that same life brother BAM said Oh what
[1:36:04] happened the church back slid or went to
[1:36:08] sleep in two traditions in the
[1:36:11] nomination how the Catholic Church tried
[1:36:13] to kill off a true believer of that
[1:36:16] original faith in the Dark Ages they
[1:36:19] tried to them out but brother man said
[1:36:23] they couldn't stomp out life even though
[1:36:26] the life was brought into Catholicism
[1:36:29] the believers like Luther in joining
[1:36:33] listen the Catholic Church a real
[1:36:36] believe in the leg seed in a
[1:36:39] denominational Church but because he was
[1:36:42] an Alexei he had a measure of their life
[1:36:45] and the church could not hold him but
[1:36:49] listen just as their first wave sheaf
[1:36:51] let me finish me my scripture Prince did
[1:36:54] I'm if I'm finished about done and the
[1:36:57] Bible says then you shall bring the
[1:37:00] sheaf of the first fruits to your
[1:37:02] harvest unto the
[1:37:03] and ye shall waved the Sheep before the
[1:37:05] Lord he says to be accepted for you now
[1:37:09] listen this wave sheaf is in the hand of
[1:37:13] the priest who has the right to go
[1:37:15] before God and God has accepted it on
[1:37:17] your behalf was being presented now I
[1:37:21] don't want you to miss this when Christ
[1:37:22] rose from the dead and God raised him up
[1:37:26] before the disciples God was saying I'm
[1:37:28] accepting him on your behalf you're
[1:37:33] going to be this not by your efforts but
[1:37:37] by my blessing that crop was going to be
[1:37:41] the same thing not by his effort the we
[1:37:44] wouldn't saying oh I gotta be like that
[1:37:45] we let me be like that we let me be like
[1:37:47] that we the weak didn't even really
[1:37:49] realize what was going on but the power
[1:37:52] of the one that was sending the blessing
[1:37:54] had the ability listen to achieve
[1:37:58] something to make the other weak come to
[1:38:01] the same position I want you to watch
[1:38:03] this when Christ was way brother Bram
[1:38:06] said on Pentecost that life that was in
[1:38:08] that way she came back and brought four
[1:38:11] more sons of God that had the same life
[1:38:14] he had and I want you to watch this
[1:38:15] because he was accepted for you listen
[1:38:17] and on the morrow after the Sabbath
[1:38:20] Dupree share waving never the messing he
[1:38:22] noticed when he waved it he didn't wave
[1:38:24] it on the Sabbath that would be the
[1:38:25] seventh day he said on tomorrow the next
[1:38:28] day after the Sabbath which means the
[1:38:30] Sunday or the eighth day professor do
[1:38:33] you notice that Christ resurrected on
[1:38:35] the eighth day not the seventh day show
[1:38:39] that it was an endless life could eight
[1:38:41] represents eternity or you follow me and
[1:38:44] so now we find that Christ being
[1:38:47] resurrected on the eighth day live it to
[1:38:50] die no more and brother BAM said now
[1:38:52] that was a type or showing what God was
[1:38:55] going to do in his last day because at
[1:38:58] the seven church ages guess what the
[1:39:01] church had drifted away from the
[1:39:04] original life but God had a promise in
[1:39:07] the Bible that in the last days I shall
[1:39:08] restore and the same way that the full
[1:39:11] word was waved over that first church
[1:39:13] because they were like Christ in the
[1:39:16] day when the church drifts awful is
[1:39:18] beating down bucket after Christ said
[1:39:22] the third day listen to me he said it'll
[1:39:26] rise again well arise again his body
[1:39:29] this time not the first corporal body
[1:39:33] this time it would be a spiritual body
[1:39:36] in our age what did God do that same son
[1:39:39] of me that lived listen two thousand
[1:39:43] years ago that same life came back into
[1:39:47] another son of man and that same life
[1:39:49] living son of man doing the same works
[1:39:52] doing the same science showing that by
[1:39:55] that resurrection the life had gone it
[1:39:57] had been blocked by the nominations but
[1:39:59] brother BAM said the denominations could
[1:40:01] not hold it after three days or three
[1:40:03] Church ages Luther's age was his age the
[1:40:05] Pentecostal age and after the third day
[1:40:08] at the you and I have been called out of
[1:40:10] Pentecost we weren't called out to go
[1:40:12] back into another search for we will
[1:40:13] call that to be the marination wave she
[1:40:16] who's she it's Christ man and where was
[1:40:19] Christ being revealed is the message of
[1:40:21] the hour and this message for almost
[1:40:25] over fifty years has been waves around
[1:40:27] the world what is God saying you have
[1:40:29] within you a potential to be this it's
[1:40:35] not gonna be your achievement it's not
[1:40:36] gonna be my achievement is your
[1:40:38] achievement it's gonna be the
[1:40:39] achievement of Almighty God not our
[1:40:41] power
[1:40:42] no by my but by my spirit I'm gonna
[1:40:44] cheese this great thing it's by grace he
[1:40:48] does it grace grace the capstone came
[1:40:51] we're going to manifest the capstone by
[1:40:54] His grace why is they predestinated
[1:40:56] unconditional covenant to the elect of
[1:40:59] Almighty God and brother BAM said if
[1:41:01] you've got their seed in his wave she's
[1:41:03] being waved over you he said you're
[1:41:04] growing you're growing cuz something's
[1:41:07] in you to respond to it by the blessings
[1:41:09] of God every time you wave that thing
[1:41:10] there's a blessing in it and it's making
[1:41:12] all those those other crop come to the
[1:41:14] same position what position did he come
[1:41:16] to a manifest a son of God showing us
[1:41:18] how God could express himself in one man
[1:41:22] so much so Billy policy only wins her
[1:41:24] room we could table to him before he got
[1:41:26] to ask profits i i'm not have those kind
[1:41:28] of discernment of visions so because
[1:41:30] back it up a little bit but he had this
[1:41:32] that the first son hey Lily Paul said he
[1:41:35] would say son he said I know before I
[1:41:37] pray what he's gonna do
[1:41:38] why because I do it according to his
[1:41:41] word and he always hears my prayer what
[1:41:44] did the first son do when he calls for
[1:41:46] Lazarus he was not worried with him that
[1:41:49] doesn't come up resurrection he knew who
[1:41:52] he was he knew the promise was and he
[1:41:55] said God always hear my prayer why why
[1:41:57] did God always hear his prayer
[1:41:59] listen Church I want to say this I'm
[1:42:00] trying to close in Christ there was no
[1:42:03] condemnation he knew who God never been
[1:42:09] sent in perfect faith he had a perfect
[1:42:10] confidence because he knew what God made
[1:42:12] him to be he said now the true believer
[1:42:15] can't we have confidence in what God in
[1:42:18] this hour has made us to be not what you
[1:42:20] feel like you are not next to what you
[1:42:22] feel like what by the word what has God
[1:42:25] made you to be and brother Bram said and
[1:42:28] if this condemnation in your heart
[1:42:30] something know that you've done that you
[1:42:32] ought not to do that's contrary to their
[1:42:34] word he said just go and get that thing
[1:42:36] right there's no fear in your heart the
[1:42:40] Bible told us in Saint John the first
[1:42:42] job Lee was chapter 5 that if we had no
[1:42:45] condemnation we had this confidence that
[1:42:47] he hears us because there's nothing
[1:42:49] between you and God
[1:42:52] you see what the BRABUS calling us to
[1:42:54] you see what the message is calling us
[1:42:56] to not just a congregate and be a
[1:42:58] synagogue around a common idea or a
[1:43:00] common theology but there's a people
[1:43:02] that literally have to bear witness of
[1:43:04] this resurrected life because it's been
[1:43:06] restored in last day and way to the
[1:43:08] church not brother Branham wave but
[1:43:10] Christ in the manifestation of the
[1:43:12] worthy our being waited by a prophets
[1:43:14] message it what is the fire for trying
[1:43:17] to do we're just trying to wave that
[1:43:18] same message not change they're not
[1:43:20] adding to it and I tell you where
[1:43:21] brother Branham was wrong and where you
[1:43:22] should not believe everything you see it
[1:43:23] but I I got in revelation to tell you
[1:43:25] what parts you can believe what parsec a
[1:43:26] belief nonsense the wave seat has been
[1:43:28] weighed it's been vindicated and I
[1:43:30] believe what he preached and there's
[1:43:33] another man don't believe it all we'll
[1:43:34] let him go his way that's fine we don't
[1:43:37] condemn the man you follow me but we
[1:43:40] keep marching
[1:43:42] and I'm not talking about then I know
[1:43:44] some UI filling some your mind drift a
[1:43:45] certain way I'm talking I'm talking
[1:43:47] about people who are actually walking to
[1:43:48] say they believe this message and no
[1:43:50] doubt preaching at certain treasures
[1:43:51] morning quoting the Prophet but at the
[1:43:54] same time my quoting the Prophet I tell
[1:43:56] you well let me tell you where this fold
[1:43:57] is wrong don't believe that quote
[1:43:59] believe this quote now I'm not saying
[1:44:02] I'm clearer and clearer and clearer that
[1:44:04] that word he preaches nothing but this
[1:44:06] word being interpreted or you follow me
[1:44:09] and I ain't even finished with this wave
[1:44:11] sheaf yet but I'm gonna say this and
[1:44:13] I'ma close I'm gonna say this in close
[1:44:15] we've got to have the same faith Abraham
[1:44:19] had when gob Abraham the Bible said
[1:44:22] Abraham looked and believed and when he
[1:44:25] believed he became what he believed once
[1:44:29] that word found good ground and Abraham
[1:44:31] the word can now manifest itself God
[1:44:35] expressed in Abraham and when this
[1:44:38] message finds good ground I pray
[1:44:40] everybody listening this morning but as
[1:44:41] resurrection morning I pray in our
[1:44:44] hearts we all have good ground to
[1:44:46] believe this message and be simple just
[1:44:49] like Mary God be it unto me according to
[1:44:53] thy word and where I see I'm falling
[1:44:56] short don't be too hard not to get on
[1:45:00] your knees and say God forgive me I
[1:45:03] don't doubt your promise but where I'm
[1:45:06] falling short forgive me and then let me
[1:45:11] forgive others and with that kind of
[1:45:14] grace in your heart they say now God may
[1:45:17] you perform in me that which you
[1:45:19] promised Abraham but he was down there
[1:45:23] in Greer when he wanted to get his wife
[1:45:24] restored the shore was predestination
[1:45:27] election Abraham was the one out of
[1:45:29] order but in order to keep his promise
[1:45:31] God went down and told that man you
[1:45:33] bless him so yeah but he did me wrong he
[1:45:35] said but that's my profit that's my son
[1:45:38] he's walking under a promise now Abraham
[1:45:42] gets punished but Babel said you do some
[1:45:43] wrong God's gonna punish you but it has
[1:45:45] nothing to do with the Covenant of
[1:45:47] promise he made you so if we have things
[1:45:49] that's wrong it doesn't break the
[1:45:50] promise it doesn't break the Covenant
[1:45:52] but it will hinder you and your walk
[1:45:54] until you get those things right
[1:45:56] we're an hour that's be ever more
[1:45:58] sincere
[1:45:59] we don't have one thing to fear about
[1:46:01] Koroma last thought I'm gonna give you a
[1:46:03] time closer I thought about that this
[1:46:05] morning I said god I got a promise
[1:46:08] 10,000 might fall him out one 2x4 once I
[1:46:11] have 10,000 the left hand I don't
[1:46:13] quarter just write this now but it
[1:46:14] should not come down me that's a promise
[1:46:16] you said brother Mike I mean let can't
[1:46:18] get sick no I didn't say that I said God
[1:46:21] might allow it to get sick but if I get
[1:46:23] sick guess what I got another promise by
[1:46:25] your stripes I'm healed you say brother
[1:46:28] Mike Corona Cain killing like God might
[1:46:30] call it like home he's gonna have to
[1:46:32] call you home sorry you don't go by body
[1:46:34] change
[1:46:34] God has to call you home wait Oh Dean
[1:46:37] even if I go by the grave
[1:46:39] I got another promise he should call it
[1:46:41] and I'll come up again
[1:46:42] Korona death has no power over a
[1:46:45] believers I'm trying to express to you
[1:46:47] not to fear it because they can do no
[1:46:50] more to you that God will allow it
[1:46:54] that's the faith of the elect same could
[1:46:57] do no more the job then God would allow
[1:47:01] it so if it knocks at your door if it
[1:47:04] gets a hole then God allowed it for a
[1:47:06] reason still don't interfere because no
[1:47:10] matter how it passes by every situation
[1:47:13] in David can bring you've got a promise
[1:47:15] let's walk in there promise
[1:47:17] how many thank God for resurrection
[1:47:19] morning Hank me thank God for a
[1:47:21] resurrection message
[1:47:23] now let's thank God for a resurrected
[1:47:26] life not in that Christ not in that son
[1:47:29] of God but in this son of God in your
[1:47:30] mortal bodies our heads dear Heavenly
[1:47:33] Father Lord we want to thank you this
[1:47:36] morning for resurrected life for
[1:47:39] witnessing already your resurrection
[1:47:41] innocence of believers for coming out
[1:47:44] under the shout in Lord I believe the
[1:47:47] brights right now was marching into a
[1:47:48] divorce the voice for the resurrection
[1:47:51] before you said that voice was V in her
[1:47:54] the call to sleep in Saints from the
[1:47:56] grave what I prayed the message this
[1:48:00] morning was simple enough that we can
[1:48:01] catch it Lord has been
[1:48:03] the resurrection when that resurrection
[1:48:07] happened happened in a change of
[1:48:09] dispensation and when this resurrection
[1:48:12] has happened it's changed a dispensation
[1:48:15] you said you know Lauren called church
[1:48:18] but you're not called a bride and you
[1:48:21] said miss Iowa in the Rising Sun that
[1:48:23] God called the bride into a bride age
[1:48:28] mister bride coming to Christ Lord I
[1:48:32] don't know how else to put it it's not
[1:48:35] man living anymore
[1:48:37] there's got to be Christ in man and Lord
[1:48:40] I've spoken it as plainly as an Ohio but
[1:48:43] God my words are just that if there's
[1:48:46] not one to come behind it I'm maxing God
[1:48:49] first that you forgive us forgive me of
[1:48:51] our sins Lord made those at our home
[1:48:55] Lord made the Bible four-year-old God
[1:48:58] not before the TV or the video or higher
[1:49:00] of their streaming not before preacher
[1:49:03] but Lord made the Bible for the
[1:49:06] resurrected son of God back in the form
[1:49:10] of the Holy Ghost
[1:49:12] Lord me now you interpret your word in
[1:49:14] our presence Lord of this sick amongst
[1:49:17] us our acts in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:49:18] we don't have been present lay hands
[1:49:20] Lord and your name may you heal them
[1:49:24] Lord you've already done the healing
[1:49:26] Lord I ask only that you anoint them
[1:49:29] with the faith to receive what's already
[1:49:30] been done Lord if they need the Holy
[1:49:33] Ghost or more of the Holy Ghost or
[1:49:35] rededication whatever they need to take
[1:49:37] their lives close to God may each one of
[1:49:39] us right now with our horse and head bow
[1:49:40] said Lord may you take me higher Lord
[1:49:42] may you give me grace to know how to
[1:49:44] surrender that I might be able to yield
[1:49:45] all I have to you that in our God and
[1:49:48] our bodies into my body you might give
[1:49:50] express yourself even now in a greater
[1:49:51] way God let us not fear the enemy let us
[1:49:54] not fear death let us not fear anything
[1:49:56] Lord for thou has conquered death held a
[1:49:57] grave and in that name Lord you've given
[1:49:59] us the same victory Lord we thank you I
[1:50:02] actually grace upon the bride around the
[1:50:04] world Lord it's checking the stand in
[1:50:05] these last hours Lord we don't know how
[1:50:07] much time we left but I don't believe
[1:50:08] it's very much more Lord Lord may you
[1:50:10] promise to God you promise there's
[1:50:11] certain things you were doing this hour
[1:50:13] god I'm accidental God according to your
[1:50:15] promise let us see those things may
[1:50:16] manifest
[1:50:17] and let us believe with all of our heart
[1:50:18] Lord we commit this day in the service
[1:50:20] in your hands not just as a memorial the
[1:50:23] world represents Easter as a memorial
[1:50:25] just something to look back on an event
[1:50:27] in this past but Lord we're not looking
[1:50:29] at a past event our memorial is not
[1:50:31] history God our moral is to recognize an
[1:50:33] event that's taking place resurrection
[1:50:35] of Jesus Christ in your bride body in
[1:50:37] this last day granted Lord we thank you
[1:50:39] and we commit all things in your hand
[1:50:41] and we accidentally Jesus Christ may may
[1:50:43] the bride save me amen amen mercy
[1:50:46] brother Abel by saying amen but the same
[1:51:04] thing he said about the coronavirus we
[1:51:07] believe that for every sickness every
[1:51:09] disease cancer yeah nothing nothing can
[1:51:13] stand and nothing can bring a believer
[1:51:16] down even if you go to the doctor and he
[1:51:18] says oh well you have cancer we know
[1:51:20] that that God could use that as a
[1:51:22] doorway to get us out and our confession
[1:51:24] should still remain positive no matter
[1:51:26] what the symptoms are that we're healed
[1:51:27] because that's what the scripture says
[1:51:28] that's that's the promise word for us so
[1:51:31] despite what the symptoms may say you
[1:51:33] know we're still healed because in the
[1:51:34] end of the day even if that cancer took
[1:51:36] your life you received your healing in
[1:51:38] heaven on the other side so despite what
[1:51:40] the sickness is despite with diseases
[1:51:42] like you brother Mike said about the
[1:51:43] coronavirus all that we know the truth
[1:51:45] we know the word we read the back of the
[1:51:47] book we know we win nothing can come and
[1:51:50] in effect the believer I that's what I
[1:51:52] believe and I believe that's right along
[1:51:53] with what brother Mike was saying so
[1:51:55] we're gonna we're gonna do this song
[1:51:57] who's actually requested to close on
