[0:00] And I thought, well, I better not do
[0:01] that. I just going to have a little
[0:04] drama of something, a character in the
[0:06] Bible.
[0:08] And thinking here, oh, in serious
[0:09] manners,
[0:11] while we're sitting here as Christians,
[0:13] I suppose most of us,
[0:16] did you know this may be the last time
[0:18] that we'll ever eat breakfast together?
[0:21] Did you ever think of that? Do you
[0:23] realize what little words that I have to
[0:25] say here? God's going to make me answer
[0:27] for it up there at the day of judgment.
[0:30] And I have souls here. No matter if it's
[0:32] a small group, but yet I have it's the
[0:35] words that I say I'll have to answer for
[0:38] them up there. So we may never eat
[0:41] another breakfast together, but I hope
[0:44] we eat a supper together someday.
[0:46] &gt;&gt; That's the last supper up there with
[0:48] him. It'll be the first one there. And
[0:51] then as we sit here this morning and I
[0:53] look upon these men here and some of
[0:55] them great ministers who studied and me
[0:59] here just
[1:01] bushmen
[1:02] come out no education sitting here man
[1:05] is qualified to preach and doctors would
[1:07] have I feel very little to stand talk
[1:09] before man like that but yet I I got to
[1:12] express what I feel and their great
[1:15] gratitude and kindness to let me stand
[1:18] and do this. I appreciate it, brothers,
[1:20] cooperating in the meeting and getting
[1:22] together. I'm here to help you. I'm
[1:24] going to do everything I can for each
[1:26] one of you by the grace of God. And then
[1:28] when it's all over someday, if I don't
[1:30] get to eat breakfast with you again,
[1:33] when it's all over, sitting across the
[1:35] table from one another, [clears throat]
[1:37] that's the time I'm looking for.
[1:39] &gt;&gt; No doubt, but little tears will run down
[1:41] our cheeks and look across the table and
[1:43] get each other by the hand. It'll mean
[1:45] something, man. That's work while it's
[1:47] time to work. Yes.
[1:48] &gt;&gt; While the sun's up, it'll be down after
[1:50] a while. It's getting very low.
[1:52] &gt;&gt; Then to think that while we're sitting
[1:53] there holding each other's hands and
[1:55] weeping a little,
[1:56] &gt;&gt; then the great king will come out and
[1:58] all of his great robes. Come down along
[2:01] the line, wipe all tears away from our
[2:03] eyes, and says, "Well done, my good and
[2:04] faithful servants. Enter into the joys
[2:07] of the Lord has been prepared for you
[2:08] since the foundation of the world. While
[2:11] it's sun's up, it's light enough to
[2:13] labor." Let's labor.
[2:16] Now, this little text here may seem kind
[2:19] of ridiculous,
[2:21] but we're going to talk on this subject.
[2:24] He was to pass this way.
[2:28] It must have been a an awful night on
[2:31] the little fella. He couldn't sleep at
[2:33] all. He just rolled and tossed all night
[2:37] long.
[2:38] It's breaking day and we all know what
[2:41] those restless nights mean. You can't
[2:43] sleep. You got something on your mind.
[2:46] or something's got your nerves all
[2:47] upset. This little fellow was a
[2:50] businessman
[2:52] maybe in a city Jericho which is
[2:55] something like you businessmen and women
[2:58] here and he um he no doubt had a growing
[3:02] business. He stood in good with the all
[3:05] the clubs and so forth and was a member
[3:08] of the church Sanhedrin council and had
[3:11] a fine priest and he believed this
[3:14] priest and the strange thing about this
[3:16] case is his wife we'll call her Rebecca.
[3:21] She had strayed off on the wrong side.
[3:24] He thought so did the priest. She was
[3:27] following a man that was supposed to be
[3:28] a prophet of Nazareth,
[3:32] a man named Jesus
[3:34] with the people, the poor class.

[53:45] Spoken Word Tabernacle where we believe
[53:47] the message of brother Brham 100%.
[53:51] Amen. Amen.
[53:52] &gt;&gt; We believe everything brother Brandham
[53:55] says
[53:56] &gt;&gt; just the way he said it.
[53:58] &gt;&gt; Even if we don't understand it, we still
[54:00] believe it.
[54:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because the Bible and the message
[54:05] are one.
[54:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:08] &gt;&gt; I believe we are all up to date with the
[54:10] sermon. We're reading our Bible twice a
[54:12] day. our COD book, Church Ages, 70 weeks
[54:16] of Daniel, the seals adoption, or
[54:18] somebody is listening to the message of
[54:22] the hour or reading the message of the
[54:24] hour. Still waiting on the deacon to
[54:26] give me the question and answer for next
[54:28] year. And uh for the church prayer
[54:31] meeting, it is on Tuesday at 7:00. And
[54:36] the only difference will be in the week
[54:39] of Thanksgiving.
[54:41] I'm saying that today. So we begin to
[54:43] soak in because Thanksgiving is probably
[54:45] two weeks down the road. So on the week
[54:48] of Thanksgiving, we have service on
[54:50] Tuesday.
[54:53] &gt;&gt; Did you hear me? Can you say amen, my
[54:55] friend?
[54:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. Uh on the week of Thanksgiving, we
[54:57] don't have service on Wednesday. We got
[55:00] service on Tuesday so we can give you a
[55:02] time on Wednesday so mama can go get
[55:05] some cooking stuff and everything going
[55:08] on and get ready for Thanksgiving. We
[55:10] clear?
[55:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. So on the week of thanksgiving,
[55:13] your service is on Tuesday. The problem
[55:16] is on Tuesday, that's when we have
[55:18] prayer service. So on the week of
[55:20] Thanksgiving, we will have service here
[55:23] on Tuesday and we will manage to preach
[55:26] a little bit get the one who's going to
[55:28] preach will preach like 30 minutes and
[55:30] then we stop and we blended with prayer
[55:34] here.
[55:35] &gt;&gt; We clear now? We clear now?
[55:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. So we have both the sermon and the
[55:41] praying and we don't miss anything. So
[55:43] when you're coming on Tuesday, get ready
[55:45] to pray the same way we pray over there
[55:47] online. Amen. But it's going to be live
[55:50] now. So no left and right. We pray. If
[55:53] you want to kneel, you kneel. If you
[55:54] want to whatever, sleep on the floor.
[55:56] Sleep on the floor. Let's go ahead and
[55:58] pray.
[55:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. [clears throat]
[56:02] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. So that is clear for
[56:04] prayer. So every Tuesday 700 p.m. prayer
[56:07] except the week of thanksgiving we have
[56:09] service on Tuesday. Lord's willing this
[56:12] coming week it's sister Yokabed's
[56:15] wedding. So you all are invited. There
[56:18] is no special waiting or special
[56:20] invitation. Everybody in the church is
[56:23] invited. Be there on time. Let's social
[56:26] show support to our sister because yours

[57:23] &gt;&gt; But we do what the Lord want you to do.
[57:25] Amen.
[57:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. My prayer is if you go somewhere
[57:28] else, may God give you a solid church,
[57:32] &gt;&gt; a solid message, church that is
[57:34] believing the message correctly
[57:37] &gt;&gt; so that you can continue to grow.
[57:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:41] &gt;&gt; So when you growing there spiritually
[57:43] and uh financially and physically as
[57:47] your soul is prospering, then your daddy
[57:50] over here is happy. And if I take uh I
[57:54] sleep up and take vacation like some
[57:56] people, I can stop by and say, "Let me
[57:58] stop by here and check and see how they
[58:00] doing, how many babies they have, and
[58:02] say, you didn't know this is your
[58:04] grandpa right here." [laughter]
[58:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:08] &gt;&gt; It's good to see God doing good things
[58:10] for his children.
[58:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:13] &gt;&gt; So remember the wedding there, the
[58:15] building, just keep us in prayer. Things
[58:17] are moving. We are uh waiting on some
[58:21] material. So keep us in prayer and
[58:23] whatever you can do, continue to do it
[58:25] because we're gearing everything toward
[58:28] the building. We're moving by faith and
[58:30] God is doing things beyond our control.
[58:33] Brother Set knows, brother John Porter,
[58:36] brother Michael, all the brother that
[58:38] that got in, brother Robert to try to
[58:40] help brother set push everything so they
[58:43] know exactly what we're talking about.
[58:44] Amen.
[58:46] &gt;&gt; But as far as your inspection there, we
[58:48] pass both of them. So everything now is
[58:50] clear. Amen.

[58:51] &gt;&gt; The coast is clear. I won't say anything

[59:06] young man meeting. We have a wonderful
[59:10] young man meeting yesterday. Amen.
[59:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:14] &gt;&gt; Oh my god. I wish I'm learning stuff
[59:17] that they are learning,
[59:19] &gt;&gt; but it's too late. I already picked
[59:20] sister Cheron and God was gracious that
[59:23] I picked Sister Sheron.
[59:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:29] &gt;&gt; Because we had to struggle to find the
[59:31] right one.
[59:32] &gt;&gt; But your job is even easy.
[59:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:34] &gt;&gt; So yesterday we clear courtship.
[59:37] [crying]
[59:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:40] &gt;&gt; And and we have to find out why do we
[59:42] need courtship?
[59:43] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. BREAK IT DOWN, PREACHER. BREAK
[59:45] IT DOWN.
[59:46] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[59:47] &gt;&gt; AMEN, BROTHER. Ah
[59:50] [laughter]
[59:51] &gt;&gt; you know you know lack of understanding
[59:53] things is causing us a lot of problem.
[59:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:57] &gt;&gt; I gave them the three step. Brother
[59:59] Brandham say the first step is courtship
[1:00:01] and the second step it's uh agreement or
[1:00:04] engagement and the third step it's
[1:00:06] marriage and we define but the problem
[1:00:08] was why do you need courtship?
[1:00:11] &gt;&gt; Good question.
[1:00:12] &gt;&gt; Because it's easy. Oh brother Stephen
[1:00:14] tell us about courtship. Okay you do
[1:00:16] this. I said before we even get to that,
[1:00:18] you need to understand why do you need
[1:00:22] courtship?
[1:00:23] &gt;&gt; I'm sorry, young sisters, you need to
[1:00:24] get that one. Amen. Why do you need If
[1:00:28] you know the reason why you need
[1:00:30] courtship,
[1:00:31] &gt;&gt; then your courtship is completely
[1:00:33] different.
[1:00:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:36] &gt;&gt; And they got the reason yesterday.
[1:00:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:39] &gt;&gt; Because there was only one person that
[1:00:41] didn't get courtship.
[1:00:42] &gt;&gt; COME ON, BROTHER.
[1:00:44] &gt;&gt; AMEN, BROTHER.
[1:00:46] That was Adam.
[1:00:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:52] &gt;&gt; Adam never had a courtship.
[1:00:54] &gt;&gt; No, sir.
[1:00:55] &gt;&gt; Adam, they deliver his wife.
[1:00:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:00] &gt;&gt; The don't [laughter]
[1:01:02] the wife of Adam was delivered like
[1:01:04] Amazon.
[1:01:08] &gt;&gt; And when Adam woke up,
[1:01:10] &gt;&gt; he didn't even have time to pray.
[1:01:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. [laughter]
[1:01:16] &gt;&gt; That's true.
[1:01:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:18] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham say that is the
[1:01:20] difference between me and you
[1:01:23] &gt;&gt; versus Adam.
[1:01:24] &gt;&gt; And I gave them a quote.
[1:01:27] &gt;&gt; I gave them a quote yesterday. They know
[1:01:29] the quote yesterday. And brother
[1:01:30] Brandham said, "That's the reason why
[1:01:32] Adam got in trouble with Eve.
[1:01:36] Don't swallow that. Uh uh, leave it
[1:01:38] alone. I got a quote. I gave them the
[1:01:40] quote. I knew this one is hard for you
[1:01:42] to swallow." He said because Adam never
[1:01:45] had a chance to pray.
[1:01:47] &gt;&gt; I have the quote. They have the code.
[1:01:49] Then they there all of them are here.
[1:01:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:01:59] &gt;&gt; I'm trying to move on. You the one
[1:02:00] holding. If you release the amen, then I
[1:02:03] continue.
[1:02:05] [laughter]
[1:02:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:08] &gt;&gt; So that's the reason why God put you in
[1:02:11] courtship.
[1:02:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:14] Are we together?
[1:02:16] &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham say before you do
[1:02:17] courtship, what do you do? You plan and
[1:02:20] you do what?
[1:02:21] &gt;&gt; You pray and you do what?
[1:02:22] &gt;&gt; Look.
[1:02:22] &gt;&gt; And you look. They already understand
[1:02:24] all of it. [laughter]
[1:02:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:28] &gt;&gt; I'm going to I'm not going to tell you
[1:02:30] everything. You go ask them, they will
[1:02:32] tell you everything. But they understand
[1:02:34] why we need a courtship. There is a
[1:02:37] reason why
[1:02:38] &gt;&gt; God put a requirement for courtship
[1:02:41] before engagement. There was a reason
[1:02:43] why and they know the reason now clearly
[1:02:45] without any problem with the scripture.
[1:02:47] We went with the scripture and pull up.
[1:02:49] Why do you need a courtship?
[1:02:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:54] &gt;&gt; And I told them courtship is the only
[1:02:56] stage
[1:02:59] &gt;&gt; father courtship is the only stage
[1:03:03] &gt;&gt; that you can come out
[1:03:05] &gt;&gt; without liability. Amen.
[1:03:08] &gt;&gt; They all I repeated that five time.
[1:03:11] &gt;&gt; Courtship is the only place you can
[1:03:15] enter in with a pencil and an eraser.
[1:03:21] &gt;&gt; Courtship is the only place you can make
[1:03:23] an error
[1:03:24] &gt;&gt; and come out without any problem.
[1:03:26] &gt;&gt; If you cross courtship
[1:03:29] &gt;&gt; and you get to engagement, you doom.
[1:03:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:03:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. If you get in marriage, you are
[1:03:38] buried.
[1:03:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. [laughter]
[1:03:42] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:03:44] &gt;&gt; So courtship is a grace period.
[1:03:48] &gt;&gt; Okay, I won't even preach what I told
[1:03:50] them. I'm just giving you load of flavor
[1:03:52] so parent understand where we were and
[1:03:55] what we spoke with them. Amen.
[1:03:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:57] &gt;&gt; Because brother say you need to know the
[1:03:59] family.
[1:04:01] I gave them the quote yesterday
[1:04:04] &gt;&gt; and brother Brandham say you need to
[1:04:05] know the background
[1:04:07] &gt;&gt; of the girl and you NEED TO ASK HER.
[1:04:11] &gt;&gt; I gave them the quote yesterday. They
[1:04:12] are all here yesterday.
[1:04:14] &gt;&gt; They were there yesterday.
[1:04:16] &gt;&gt; And I told them the reason why they need
[1:04:18] to know the background. I gave an
[1:04:20] example yesterday. Amen.
[1:04:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. [applause]
[1:04:29] I say note uh let's go to our sermon.
[1:04:33] [laughter]
[1:04:36] &gt;&gt; Ah so you want to hear their stuff.
[1:04:40] [laughter]
[1:04:46] &gt;&gt; I Okay, I'm not going to disclose
[1:04:49] everything. I told them I say not
[1:04:53] everybody
[1:04:55] grew up in the same home. That's right.
[1:05:00] &gt;&gt; Some grow up Some grow up with both
[1:05:03] parent present.
[1:05:07] &gt;&gt; Some grow up with a single parent.
[1:05:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:11] &gt;&gt; Some will grow up when parent are
[1:05:14] message believer
[1:05:16] &gt;&gt; and some are grow grown into an
[1:05:19] environment where both parent are not
[1:05:21] even message believer.
[1:05:24] &gt;&gt; Are we together? I say so you need to
[1:05:27] know the background
[1:05:28] &gt;&gt; of the woman that you're dealing with.
[1:05:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:34] &gt;&gt; If that woman came from a single mother
[1:05:37] home.
[1:05:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:42] &gt;&gt; That's true.
[1:05:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:44] &gt;&gt; I'm not talking about a woman in the
[1:05:46] world because we already eliminated it.
[1:05:48] &gt;&gt; We say your courtship is not with
[1:05:50] unbelievers. It's not with make believer
[1:05:53] but the courtship is with believers.
[1:05:56] &gt;&gt; And Solomon say many women are virtuous
[1:06:00] &gt;&gt; but you are above all.
[1:06:02] &gt;&gt; So you need to find the one that is
[1:06:04] above the virtues.
[1:06:07] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:06:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:08] &gt;&gt; I don't know why my finger keep going
[1:06:10] this direction.
[1:06:12] [laughter]
[1:06:14] &gt;&gt; I got brother Joshua and uh and the big
[1:06:17] boss over here. So my finger keep going.
[1:06:19] So let me go this way a little bit.
[1:06:21] [laughter]
[1:06:24] Are we together? Here is brother Angelo
[1:06:27] and brother Hamilton and then brother
[1:06:29] Benj I'm loosening you up because
[1:06:31] something is coming.
[1:06:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. I say so when when when when you
[1:06:36] have a daughter uh I mean I mean a child
[1:06:39] of God filled with the Holy Spirit
[1:06:43] uh being baptized message believer and
[1:06:46] then she grew up with uh with her mother
[1:06:49] alone. I say you need to be very careful
[1:06:54] &gt;&gt; and you need to know the background
[1:06:56] because knowing that she grew up with a
[1:06:59] single mother
[1:07:00] &gt;&gt; it's important for you.
[1:07:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. It doesn't say you need to
[1:07:04] separate from her,
[1:07:06] &gt;&gt; but it's preparing you for your future
[1:07:09] &gt;&gt; if that is your wife.
[1:07:11] &gt;&gt; I say because if she was the only one,
[1:07:14] especially if she was the only one
[1:07:19] &gt;&gt; of that family,
[1:07:21] &gt;&gt; then you need to be more aware of it.
[1:07:32] And I told them if I tell this to
[1:07:34] married people some of them will be
[1:07:36] crying.
[1:07:38] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:07:39] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:07:41] &gt;&gt; Ah. All right. There is a daughter that
[1:07:43] is born in the family.
[1:07:46] &gt;&gt; And if she is the first one, she is
[1:07:49] daddy's girl.
[1:07:50] &gt;&gt; That's correct.
[1:07:52] &gt;&gt; You're going to understand me very well.
[1:07:54] If he is a boy, he's going to be mama's
[1:07:58] boy.
[1:08:00] &gt;&gt; Now you begin to understand me very
[1:08:02] well.
[1:08:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:04] &gt;&gt; The boy will go straight to mama and the
[1:08:07] girl will go straight to daddy.
[1:08:09] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:08:11] &gt;&gt; And it's no more to have a competition
[1:08:13] between the girl and mama.
[1:08:20] &gt;&gt; Remember the minute you're taking.
[1:08:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:08:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:24] &gt;&gt; Because the girl will try to show that
[1:08:26] daddy belong to him.
[1:08:30] &gt;&gt; When daddy really belong to mama.
[1:08:33] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:08:34] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:08:36] &gt;&gt; So when this little girl is growing up,
[1:08:38] whenever daddy's coming home, what do
[1:08:40] you think the girl is coming up?
[1:08:43] &gt;&gt; She will be running straight to the door
[1:08:46] before even mommy move. and she will be
[1:08:48] the one opening her arm and jumping on
[1:08:51] daddy because daddy is everything to
[1:08:54] her.
[1:08:55] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:08:57] &gt;&gt; Even if that whenever daddy's coming
[1:08:59] home, he's thinking about her.
[1:09:03] &gt;&gt; If daddy need to buy McDonald, he's
[1:09:05] buying McDonald for her.
[1:09:08] &gt;&gt; Daddy mind is wrapping around that that
[1:09:11] young woman right there at home.
[1:09:14] &gt;&gt; And sometime mommy may get even a little
[1:09:16] jealous.
[1:09:19] Are we together?
[1:09:21] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:09:22] &gt;&gt; And this GIRL IS GROWING UP under daddy.
[1:09:26] Daddy's favorite. If she wants
[1:09:28] something, she will not ask mommy
[1:09:31] &gt;&gt; because mommy will wrestle with her.
[1:09:33] &gt;&gt; She will go around and talk to daddy
[1:09:36] because she know how to wrap around
[1:09:38] daddy and to get whatever she want.
[1:09:41] &gt;&gt; Are we together? And suddenly at 6 years
[1:09:45] old a divorce happened.
[1:09:50] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together now.
[1:09:52] &gt;&gt; I hope we are TOGETHER NOW. NOW MOMMY
[1:09:55] SEPARATED.
[1:09:57] &gt;&gt; Daddy goes to the other side.
[1:09:59] &gt;&gt; Now the daddy that used to be available
[1:10:01] every day
[1:10:03] &gt;&gt; is no longer available at home.
[1:10:06] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Now they have to go
[1:10:09] from one home to another
[1:10:11] &gt;&gt; and before you know it, daddy goes and
[1:10:13] get married.
[1:10:16] &gt;&gt; Are we together? And mommy stayed there
[1:10:19] with a boyfriend that usually come and
[1:10:21] help and be handy for the hard stuff at
[1:10:24] home.
[1:10:27] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. I know where
[1:10:29] it's sinking. Are we together?
[1:10:31] &gt;&gt; Are we together? So suddenly this young
[1:10:34] girl is growing up with a big void of a
[1:10:37] masculine spirit.
[1:10:43] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:10:45] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:10:46] &gt;&gt; WHEN YOU HAVE SUCH A BACKGROUND, YOU
[1:10:48] NEED TO BE VERY CAREFUL.
[1:10:51] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Amen.
[1:10:53] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THAT GIRL IS OPEN up now to a
[1:10:56] man
[1:11:00] &gt;&gt; THAT WILL SHOW HIM TRUE LOVE.
[1:11:03] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:11:04] &gt;&gt; SO WHEN YOU COMING AS A young man to
[1:11:07] marry that woman, remember you are not
[1:11:09] GOING TO BE JUST A HUSBAND.
[1:11:13] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together.
[1:11:15] YOU MUST BE A HUSBAND AND A FATHER
[1:11:19] &gt;&gt; IN ORDER TO COMPENSATE
[1:11:22] THE VOID THAT THE WOMAN HAVE.
[1:11:25] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:11:27] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. This is why I do
[1:11:29] my surgery with couple like 6 hours or 7
[1:11:33] hours.
[1:11:33] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:11:35] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:11:36] &gt;&gt; Are we together? BECAUSE SHE HAVE DONE
[1:11:39] BUILT A COMPLEX AND SHE'S LOOKING FOR A
[1:11:42] TRUE LOVE
[1:11:43] &gt;&gt; THAT SHE MISSES FROM her father.
[1:11:46] &gt;&gt; And if the young man is stupid,
[1:11:52] &gt;&gt; if he is ignorant
[1:11:55] &gt;&gt; and doesn't understand the mechanic OF
[1:11:57] THESE THINGS,
[1:11:58] &gt;&gt; HE WILL THINK HIS WIFE IS MORE
[1:12:00] POSSESSIVE.
[1:12:04] &gt;&gt; But the WIFE IS NOT REALLY POSSESSIVE.
[1:12:07] THE WIFE IS TRYING to to to TO FILL THE
[1:12:10] VOID THAT HAVE BEEN THERE FOR YEARS.
[1:12:14] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY SHE CALLS YOU ALL THE TIME.
[1:12:17] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY SHE WANT YOU TO TOUCH HER ALL
[1:12:19] THE TIME
[1:12:20] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE SHE'S TRYING TO RECUPERATE THE
[1:12:23] VOID THAT HAPPENED BEFORE.
[1:12:26] &gt;&gt; THAT'S THE REASON WHY IF EVEN IF YOU
[1:12:28] WANT to go TO HOME DEPOT, SHE WANT TO GO
[1:12:30] WITH YOU
[1:12:31] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE SHE MISS GOING TO HOME DEPOT
[1:12:33] WITH HER FATHER. BUT TO YOU, HOME DEPOT
[1:12:36] IS NOT FOR WOMEN. IT'S FOR MEN.
[1:12:38] &gt;&gt; BUT YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND. YOU'RE DEALING
[1:12:40] WITH A DIFFERENT CATEGORY.
[1:12:43] &gt;&gt; I HOPE WE ARE TOGETHER.
[1:12:45] &gt;&gt; THE BIBLE SAYS THAT HOW MANY CHILDREN
[1:12:48] DID SARAH HAVE?
[1:12:50] &gt;&gt; SARAH, the wife of Abraham. How many
[1:12:52] children did she have?
[1:12:54] &gt;&gt; What was the name of the baby?
[1:12:55] &gt;&gt; Isaac.
[1:12:56] &gt;&gt; And uh and THE BIBLE SAY THAT ISAAC WAS
[1:12:58] THE ONLY ONE. SO HE WAS MAMA'S BOY.
[1:13:02] &gt;&gt; AND WHAT HAPPENED? SARAH DIED
[1:13:07] &gt;&gt; AND THE BIBLE SAY WHEN ISAAC GOT MARRIED
[1:13:09] TO REBECCA, REBECCA ACTUALLY CAME AND
[1:13:13] COMFORTED ISAAC FOR HIS MOTHER.
[1:13:16] &gt;&gt; SO REBECCA HAVE TO BE A WIFE AND A MAMA.
[1:13:22] &gt;&gt; I HOPE WE ARE TOGETHER. LEARN THE
[1:13:24] BACKGROUND OF YOUR WIFE.
[1:13:26] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:13:31] &gt;&gt; GOD, it's a powerful revelation.
[1:13:34] Amen.
[1:13:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:37] &gt;&gt; You will see your wife acting like a
[1:13:39] child. You don't understand why she's
[1:13:41] acting like a child. Because she found a
[1:13:43] man now
[1:13:44] &gt;&gt; that love him
[1:13:45] &gt;&gt; and she have to react the way she was
[1:13:48] acting up with her father.
[1:13:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:51] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:13:52] &gt;&gt; But because you grew up with a mommy and
[1:13:55] a daddy, you think everybody think like
[1:13:58] you
[1:13:59] &gt;&gt; right? Amen.
[1:14:02] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:14:03] &gt;&gt; Because you grew up with a mother and a
[1:14:05] father all the time. You don't see the
[1:14:08] value of both of them,
[1:14:09] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:14:10] &gt;&gt; But the one who miss a mama or a daddy
[1:14:13] understand the value of it. And you
[1:14:15] think everybody need to think like you,
[1:14:17] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:14:18] &gt;&gt; That's why you need to know the
[1:14:19] background of your wife.
[1:14:21] &gt;&gt; The background of your husband.
[1:14:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:24] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:14:26] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:14:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:27] &gt;&gt; Let me close right here. the remaining.
[1:14:29] Go ask the young man.
[1:14:31] &gt;&gt; That's powerful.
[1:14:35] &gt;&gt; I hope it's sinking. I'm giving you time
[1:14:37] for that to soak in.
[1:14:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:43] &gt;&gt; Know who you dealing with.
[1:14:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:45] &gt;&gt; They are Christian. They are still in
[1:14:47] the flesh.
[1:14:48] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:14:51] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
[1:14:53] &gt;&gt; She want all the time me to be with her.
[1:14:55] She want to talk to me all the time.
[1:14:57] There is a reason why she's reacting
[1:14:58] like that.
[1:15:06] &gt;&gt; The [laughter] seven season.
[1:15:09] &gt;&gt; I told you if I tell this to all the
[1:15:11] people, you would know it's going to go.
[1:15:12] I'm letting the surgery go.
[1:15:16] &gt;&gt; I don't know who the Lord is talking to
[1:15:18] visibly or invisible audience.
[1:15:23] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:15:24] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:15:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. And you keep blaming your husband.
[1:15:27] You didn't understand the background of
[1:15:29] your husband.
[1:15:31] &gt;&gt; And there is a reason why God built you
[1:15:33] a certain way.
[1:15:34] &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham say your wife
[1:15:36] should be complimentary. That's what I
[1:15:39] gave it to them.
[1:15:40] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:15:40] &gt;&gt; So you coming to bring it's not a joke
[1:15:43] in marriage.
[1:15:44] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:15:48] &gt;&gt; You coming to bring the missing part
[1:15:51] &gt;&gt; into the marriage. You coming to waken
[1:15:54] that man right there and to tell him you
[1:15:56] a man.
[1:15:58] &gt;&gt; Don't put him down. Build him up.
[1:16:00] &gt;&gt; Say you a man.
[1:16:02] &gt;&gt; I know you didn't grow with your father
[1:16:03] but you a man.
[1:16:05] &gt;&gt; I believe you a man.
[1:16:09] &gt;&gt; Waken the LION FROM HIM.
[1:16:11] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:16:13] &gt;&gt; THE LION IS THERE. THE LION HAS BEEN
[1:16:16] DORMANT. JUST AWAKEN THE LION.
[1:16:20] AMEN.
[1:16:23] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:16:26] &gt;&gt; You grew up with mom and daddy, be
[1:16:28] grateful.
[1:16:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:30] &gt;&gt; But understand, not everybody grew up
[1:16:32] like you.
[1:16:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:34] &gt;&gt; And whoever you get hooked to, be
[1:16:36] careful.
[1:16:37] &gt;&gt; Be careful how you blabber.
[1:16:40] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:16:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. Be careful how you talk.
[1:16:45] You will hurt her deeply
[1:16:48] &gt;&gt; and you will cause a scar because she's
[1:16:50] already scarred from six years old,
[1:16:53] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:16:57] &gt;&gt; And you think she's childish.
[1:17:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:01] &gt;&gt; She's acting up like a child.
[1:17:03] &gt;&gt; She should be mature.
[1:17:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:11] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. Yes sir.
[1:17:13] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together
[1:17:14] &gt;&gt; and before you know it, you turn to be
[1:17:16] an abuser
[1:17:18] &gt;&gt; because you didn't understand the void
[1:17:20] that happened in childhood.
[1:17:22] &gt;&gt; Maybe mama died.
[1:17:25] &gt;&gt; Maybe daddy died.
[1:17:27] &gt;&gt; You need to be careful how you dealing
[1:17:29] with that individual.
[1:17:31] &gt;&gt; So be a mama for that person.
[1:17:34] &gt;&gt; BE A DADDY FOR THAT PERSON
[1:17:36] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THAT PERSON IS GROWING UP WITH A
[1:17:38] BIG VOID.

[1:17:42] BIG VOID. AND FINALLY, THE LORD GAVE ME
[1:17:45] MY SPOUSE. SO FINALLY, I'M GOING TO FIND

[1:17:54] FATHER, WHO WILL BE MY DADDY, WHO WILL
[1:17:56] CORRECT ME, WHO WILL EDUCATE ME.
[1:18:04] &gt;&gt; Not who's going to put me down
[1:18:06] &gt;&gt; and say you're supposed to know this.
[1:18:08] She didn't grow up with a mama. What do
[1:18:10] you want?

[1:18:56] &gt;&gt; to cure your marriages.
[1:18:58] &gt;&gt; Exactly.
[1:18:59] &gt;&gt; Don't be too quick to blame.
[1:19:01] &gt;&gt; No sir.
[1:19:02] &gt;&gt; Okay. Don't be too quick to put down.
[1:19:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. Wonderful.
[1:19:07] &gt;&gt; If you strong, the strong need to
[1:19:11] &gt;&gt; lift the feeble.
[1:19:14] &gt;&gt; Not put down the feeble.
[1:19:16] &gt;&gt; Know the background. Know the family
[1:19:18] where she's coming from.
[1:19:22] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:19:23] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Do you see how many
[1:19:25] divorces we got in the message?
[1:19:30] &gt;&gt; A lack of understanding.
[1:19:32] &gt;&gt; A lack of correct teaching. Amen.
[1:19:38] &gt;&gt; Who told you because your wife is 50
[1:19:40] years old, she cannot jump a rope?
[1:19:44] &gt;&gt; Where did you get that?
[1:19:46] &gt;&gt; Who told you that?
[1:19:49] &gt;&gt; Who told you that?
[1:19:54] &gt;&gt; You see how you get in trouble?
[1:19:59] We greet you all in the precious name of
[1:20:01] our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. Amen.
[1:20:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:05] &gt;&gt; Can I start preaching?
[1:20:07] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:20:10] &gt;&gt; Because what I have today is even uh a
[1:20:14] little bit more tougher because we got
[1:20:16] to correct things properly in the
[1:20:18] message. Amen.
[1:20:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:20] &gt;&gt; This is a scripture that that brother
[1:20:22] Brandham spoke about it and I say amen,
[1:20:24] but I didn't understand. And it took me
[1:20:27] a while until I look it up in the
[1:20:29] scripture and the Holy Spirit showed to
[1:20:31] me right there. I say, "Oh my god, I see
[1:20:33] why brother Brandham says that."
[1:20:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:36] &gt;&gt; But it goes into different realm and it
[1:20:38] causes problem in the message.
[1:20:40] &gt;&gt; So let's go in and dig in. So married
[1:20:43] couple meeting part 8 in December the

[1:20:50] forgotten anything? Brother Tony flight

[1:21:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.

[1:21:13] &gt;&gt; Why do you need a courtship?
[1:21:16] &gt;&gt; Why? Why did God put courtship? Why?
[1:21:19] What was the purpose of courtship? What
[1:21:20] is the mind of God behind courtship?
[1:21:23] &gt;&gt; If you understand that, you won't play
[1:21:26] in courtship.
[1:21:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. You will enter courtship
[1:21:32] prayerfully and be very careful of what
[1:21:35] you're doing. Let's go to Proverb

[1:22:34] different person totally than what I

[1:22:38] religion.
[1:22:43] &gt;&gt; And this is not a place for religion.

[1:24:41] you look at them, you just shake your
[1:24:42] hand and you don't even know what you're
[1:24:44] talking about.

[1:24:47] millennium.

[1:27:08] &gt;&gt; You who?
[1:27:09] &gt;&gt; Slugger.
[1:27:10] &gt;&gt; So they're talking to a lazy person
[1:27:13] &gt;&gt; who doesn't want to work.
[1:27:15] &gt;&gt; You understand this now?
[1:27:17] &gt;&gt; Because work is divine.
[1:27:19] &gt;&gt; You understand that, right?

[1:27:25] uh scripture last Sunday. Jesus was a
[1:27:27] carpenter. He have a job.

[1:27:32] God had a job and a batch. When he goes
[1:27:36] around, they say the carpenter,
[1:27:38] &gt;&gt; the carpenter. He was a carpenter.
[1:27:40] &gt;&gt; He was working. He was a working man. We
[1:27:42] clear on that, right? He say you slagger
[1:27:45] consider its ways and be what?
[1:27:48] &gt;&gt; Wise. So this wisdom can be acquired
[1:27:51] only by observing the ant.
[1:27:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:55] &gt;&gt; What is the wisdom? Which have no guide
[1:27:58] and what?
[1:27:59] &gt;&gt; Overseer
[1:28:00] &gt;&gt; or what?
[1:28:01] &gt;&gt; Ruler.

[1:28:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:29] &gt;&gt; It is a season of blessing.
[1:28:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:33] &gt;&gt; But it's also a season of working.
[1:28:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:37] &gt;&gt; For the future season.
[1:28:39] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:28:42] The message has already been preached
[1:28:44] which is winter.
[1:28:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:47] &gt;&gt; So the the the ant enjoy summer,
[1:28:52] &gt;&gt; enjoy the fall or the harvest but at the
[1:28:55] same time the ant have a foresight.
[1:28:58] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:28:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:00] &gt;&gt; It is utilizing the blessing of summer
[1:29:03] and fall
[1:29:05] &gt;&gt; to prepare the winter.
[1:29:08] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Amen.
[1:29:10] &gt;&gt; And brother Brham told us this and I'm
[1:29:13] going to remind you this based on this.
[1:29:16] We have two two season right here. You
[1:29:19] remember this so I don't have to read
[1:29:20] it. We have a mortal season.
[1:29:24] &gt;&gt; You know that right? And we have what?
[1:29:27] &gt;&gt; Immortal season.
[1:29:28] &gt;&gt; You need to keep that in mind if we can
[1:29:30] get where we heading. Amen.
[1:29:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm trying to save time because
[1:29:35] you pull time from me. Brother Brandham
[1:29:37] says this in this quote again. He says,
[1:29:39] "Sometime we find oursselfves doing
[1:29:41] what?
[1:29:42] &gt;&gt; Prone to run from work."
[1:29:44] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.
[1:29:46] [laughter]
[1:29:48] &gt;&gt; Prone to do what?
[1:29:49] &gt;&gt; Run from work.
[1:29:50] &gt;&gt; When work is divine.
[1:29:53] &gt;&gt; But some people want to dodge work.
[1:29:57] &gt;&gt; They don't want to work.
[1:29:59] &gt;&gt; They want to sit watching TV
[1:30:02] &gt;&gt; and sticking on food stamp.
[1:30:06] I hope we together.
[1:30:08] &gt;&gt; That's the reason why the government NOW
[1:30:10] IS SHAKING FOOD STAMP.
[1:30:18] &gt;&gt; $1,300 in food
[1:30:23] &gt;&gt; and you think you prospering. YOU'RE NOT
[1:30:25] PROSPERING. You are staying
[1:30:27] underdeveloped
[1:30:30] &gt;&gt; because of footstep.
[1:30:34] &gt;&gt; And to keep it either you need to have a
[1:30:36] lot of babies.
[1:30:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:38] &gt;&gt; Or you need to tell a lie.
[1:30:49] &gt;&gt; SHAKE YOURSELF FROM FOOD STAMP.
[1:30:52] &gt;&gt; INCREASE YOUR INCOME.
[1:30:55] BUDGET YOUR FOOD
[1:30:57] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE IF YOUR FOOD IS COMING FROM YOUR
[1:30:59] PAYCHECK,
[1:31:00] &gt;&gt; YOU WON'T SPEND AS MUCH FOOD AS YOU
[1:31:02] SPENDING ON A FOOD STAMP.
[1:31:09] &gt;&gt; IF THEY TELL YOU GO BUY YOUR FOOD for
[1:31:11] your paycheck, YOU WOULD KNOW EXACTLY
[1:31:13] WHAT you need to pick.
[1:31:15] &gt;&gt; BUT IF YOU BUYING FOOD FROM A FOOD
[1:31:17] STAMP, YOU COLLECT ALL KIND OF GARBAGE.
[1:31:21] YOU WILL GET CANDIES AND COOKIES AND ALL
[1:31:24] TYPE OF SWEET AND JELLY AND AND JELLY
[1:31:28] BEANS AND ALL KIND OF STUFF AND BEFORE
[1:31:30] YOU KNOW IT, YOU ARE OBESE
[1:31:33] &gt;&gt; AND YOU HAVE A HEART PROBLEM AND A SUGAR
[1:31:35] PROBLEM BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T CORRECT
[1:31:38] THINGS CORRECTLY.
[1:31:41] &gt;&gt; IN THIS CHURCH, WE PREACH EVERYTHING.
[1:31:44] &gt;&gt; IN THIS CHURCH, WE PREACH EVERYTHING.
[1:31:47] [applause]
[1:31:48] &gt;&gt; AMEN. AMEN.
[1:31:51] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:31:53] &gt;&gt; Food stamp was placed for a certain type
[1:31:56] of people, [cheering]
[1:31:57] &gt;&gt; but it's going to be a blockage from
[1:31:59] your progression
[1:32:02] &gt;&gt; because to keep it, you got to give a
[1:32:04] low income.
[1:32:06] &gt;&gt; LAZY, YOU DON'T WANT TO WORK.
[1:32:08] &gt;&gt; LET THE FOOD STAMP GO.
[1:32:15] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together.
[1:32:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:18] Amen.
[1:32:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:22] &gt;&gt; Can I continue?
[1:32:24] &gt;&gt; I don't know where this weapon is coming
[1:32:26] today.
[1:32:27] [laughter]
[1:32:30] &gt;&gt; BROTHER BRANDHAM SAY WE DON'T WANT TO WE
[1:32:33] WHAT?
[1:32:33] &gt;&gt; We don't want TO WORK.
[1:32:34] &gt;&gt; SOME PEOPLE JUST THINK they can make
[1:32:36] their living water
[1:32:38] &gt;&gt; without working.
[1:32:39] &gt;&gt; That's why you stay with mama.
[1:32:44] So your life is just eating
[1:32:46] &gt;&gt; and staying with madma
[1:32:53] &gt;&gt; because mama got a house 30 years old. I
[1:32:55] mean 30 years ago and they already paid
[1:32:57] the house off.
[1:32:58] &gt;&gt; So you stay around mama stick around
[1:33:00] mama sit there got a food stamp. Mama
[1:33:03] come. Where is my food?
[1:33:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. So all your time is about sex
[1:33:09] &gt;&gt; and drinking
[1:33:10] &gt;&gt; and smoking and you need money to smoke
[1:33:13] and to go to the nightclub
[1:33:15] &gt;&gt; and before you know it you stick around
[1:33:17] the gas station
[1:33:19] &gt;&gt; and you stick around the store
[1:33:21] &gt;&gt; because you're looking for somebody to
[1:33:23] exchange food stamp
[1:33:31] &gt;&gt; because you need money for alcohol
[1:33:35] &gt;&gt; NOT IN THIS CHURCH,
[1:33:37] &gt;&gt; NOT IN THIS CHURCH,
[1:33:39] &gt;&gt; NOT IN SPOKEN WORD.
[1:33:43] &gt;&gt; FOOTSTEPS SHOULD BE SEASON NOW,
[1:33:46] &gt;&gt; TEMPORARY.
[1:33:48] &gt;&gt; AFTER YOU FINISH, GET OFF OF IT.
[1:33:52] [cheering and applause]
[1:33:54] &gt;&gt; Can I hear amen?
[1:33:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:59] &gt;&gt; The word in this church will chase you
[1:34:01] everywhere.
[1:34:04] Can I continue?
[1:34:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:06] &gt;&gt; You want to go home?
[1:34:07] &gt;&gt; No, sir.
[1:34:07] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. But brother Brandham say, "But I
[1:34:10] think water."
[1:34:11] &gt;&gt; Solomon,
[1:34:12] &gt;&gt; it was that said we could find water.
[1:34:14] &gt;&gt; Hear the answer.
[1:34:15] &gt;&gt; In doing what?
[1:34:16] &gt;&gt; Watching an ant.
[1:34:22] &gt;&gt; Let me leave that alone because that
[1:34:24] will hurt so much.
[1:34:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:28] &gt;&gt; You got a big footstep. $1,500
[1:34:32] &gt;&gt; birthday. You're not afraid of
[1:34:33] birthdays, parties
[1:34:35] &gt;&gt; because of food stamp.
[1:34:37] &gt;&gt; True.
[1:34:39] &gt;&gt; If you if it comes from your money, you
[1:34:41] won't have all the parties all the time.
[1:34:54] &gt;&gt; Do I know your bank account?
[1:34:55] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:34:59] &gt;&gt; All righty. AH YEAH BUT I THINK SOLOMON
[1:35:02] he was that said we could find what
[1:35:04] &gt;&gt; here the answer
[1:35:05] &gt;&gt; where do we find the answer
[1:35:06] &gt;&gt; in watching an ant
[1:35:08] &gt;&gt; in watching the ant you know a little
[1:35:10] ant they tell me if that every ant
[1:35:13] doesn't work and do what
[1:35:15] &gt;&gt; and lay in.
[1:35:16] &gt;&gt; So in the ant you working to eat but you
[1:35:19] must WORK ALSO TO SAVE.
[1:35:21] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:35:21] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:35:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:23] &gt;&gt; You are utilizing money for your daily
[1:35:25] living. Amen. But you also must save. If
[1:35:30] you don't save,
[1:35:32] &gt;&gt; I don't know how ant knows who didn't
[1:35:34] work.
[1:35:35] &gt;&gt; So they must have some drone going
[1:35:37] around.
[1:35:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. If it doesn't work AND LAYING THAT
[1:35:41] ANT DOES NOT DO WHAT?
[1:35:43] &gt;&gt; EAT that winter.
[1:35:44] &gt;&gt; SO DON'T BLAME THE ANT.
[1:35:47] &gt;&gt; Blame the lazy one.
[1:35:49] &gt;&gt; SO EVERYBODY HAS TO DO WHAT?
[1:35:51] &gt;&gt; TO WORK.
[1:35:52] &gt;&gt; SO WORK IS DIVINE.
[1:35:54] &gt;&gt; AMEN.

[1:37:46] &gt;&gt; Verse 18. Glory to God. [laughter]
[1:37:50] Spoken word.
[1:37:54] Amen.
[1:37:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:56] &gt;&gt; Verse 18. If you dare, you can say amen.
[1:37:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:59] &gt;&gt; This is that sayaith the Lord. Huh?
[1:38:02] Behold that which I have seen. We clear?
[1:38:06] &gt;&gt; Mhm.
[1:38:07] &gt;&gt; It is what?
[1:38:08] &gt;&gt; Good.
[1:38:09] &gt;&gt; And what?
[1:38:09] &gt;&gt; And comely. Do you know what that word
[1:38:11] comely means? It is proper.
[1:38:16] &gt;&gt; It is good and it's proper.
[1:38:18] &gt;&gt; It is fitted.
[1:38:20] &gt;&gt; It's appropriate.
[1:38:23] &gt;&gt; It is good and it's proper. We need to
[1:38:25] know why. What is it good and proper
[1:38:28] &gt;&gt; and comely? The Bible say it is good and
[1:38:31] what
[1:38:32] &gt;&gt; comely
[1:38:33] &gt;&gt; for one to eat
[1:38:36] &gt;&gt; and to do what?
[1:38:37] &gt;&gt; And to drink
[1:38:38] &gt;&gt; and to do what? Enjoy the good of all
[1:38:40] his labor.
[1:38:41] &gt;&gt; Enjoy the good of what?
[1:38:43] &gt;&gt; All his labor
[1:38:45] &gt;&gt; that he has taken where?
[1:38:47] &gt;&gt; Under the sun.
[1:38:48] &gt;&gt; ALL THE DAYS OF WHAT?
[1:38:50] &gt;&gt; HIS LIFE
[1:38:51] &gt;&gt; WHICH GOD gives him. FOR IT IS WHAT?
[1:38:54] &gt;&gt; HIS PORTION.
[1:38:55] &gt;&gt; SO THERE IS NOTHING WRONG ABOUT eating
[1:38:57] and drinking AND ENJOYING THE BLESSING
[1:39:00] THAT GOD GAVE YOU.
[1:39:02] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:39:03] &gt;&gt; AMEN.

[1:42:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:15] &gt;&gt; And our wisdom, our prosperity is
[1:42:17] different than Laisha.
[1:42:19] &gt;&gt; You understand that, RIGHT?
[1:42:20] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:42:21] &gt;&gt; LAODESIA KICK JESUS OUTSIDE. and they
[1:42:24] are filled with worldly good
[1:42:26] &gt;&gt; and they have need OF NOTHING. WE ARE
[1:42:29] WELCOMING JESUS INSIDE.
[1:42:31] &gt;&gt; WE ARE NOT KEEPING CHRIST. WE GIVE GOD
[1:42:34] FIRST. WE ARE SEEKING FIRST THE KINGDOM
[1:42:36] OF GOD. THEN EVERYTHING ELSE IS ADDED BY
[1:42:41] JESUS.
[1:42:42] &gt;&gt; IT IS JESUS THE KINGDOM THAT IS BRINGING
[1:42:45] US EVERYTHING. BECAUSE THE BIBLE SAY I
[1:42:48] AM THE LORD THAT GIVE YOU POWER TO GET
[1:42:52] WEALTH. IT IS WRITTEN IN YOUR BIBLE.
[1:42:55] &gt;&gt; IF YOU DON'T KNOW IT, RAISE YOUR HAND.
[1:42:58] &gt;&gt; You don't know that scripture.
[1:43:00] &gt;&gt; You don't know that scripture.
[1:43:03] &gt;&gt; Keep your finger here.
[1:43:05] &gt;&gt; Let's go to Deuteronomy 8.
[1:43:10] &gt;&gt; I have to push this scripture.
[1:43:12] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:43:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:18] &gt;&gt; I don't need healing in a millennium. I
[1:43:20] have a glorified body. I need the
[1:43:22] healing now.
[1:43:30] &gt;&gt; I don't need money in the millennium.
[1:43:38] &gt;&gt; Right here.
[1:43:40] &gt;&gt; I DON'T NEED TO PAY MY BILLS IN THE
[1:43:42] MILLENNIUM.
[1:43:43] &gt;&gt; I NEED TO PAY MY BILLS ON TIME HERE.
[1:43:45] &gt;&gt; SO WHEN BROTHER TONY IS LEADING THE
[1:43:47] SONG, OH, HALLELUJAH.
[1:43:50] HE MADE A WAY.
[1:43:52] &gt;&gt; WHEN I WON, MY BACK WAS AGAINST THE
[1:43:54] WALL. HE MADE A WAY. WHY? BECAUSE HE'S
[1:43:57] ABLE.
[1:44:05] &gt;&gt; We're going to shake those demon away
[1:44:06] from this place.
[1:44:10] &gt;&gt; We can live a decent LIFE AND BE
[1:44:12] CHRISTIAN.
[1:44:14] &gt;&gt; BE LIKE BROTHER BURCH.
[1:44:16] &gt;&gt; BE LIKE A JOB.
[1:44:20] BE LIKE A JOHN SHAR.
[1:44:28] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:44:30] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:44:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:31] &gt;&gt; Uh Deuteronomy 8:18. Let's go because
[1:44:34] some of you didn't know.
[1:44:37] &gt;&gt; I want to say this because I don't want
[1:44:39] you to say my pastor said, "BUT YOU
[1:44:41] SHALL DO WHAT?"
[1:44:42] &gt;&gt; Remember the Lord
[1:44:43] &gt;&gt; your God for IT IS HE
[1:44:45] &gt;&gt; THAT DO WHAT? giveth thee power
[1:44:47] &gt;&gt; to do what?
[1:44:48] &gt;&gt; To get wealth.
[1:44:52] &gt;&gt; DID YOU VERIFY THAT?
[1:44:54] &gt;&gt; IT IS THE LORD THAT GIVE YOU POWER TO DO
[1:44:56] WHAT?
[1:44:57] &gt;&gt; TO GET WEALTH.
[1:44:58] &gt;&gt; SO OUR WEALTH IS NOT COMING FROM A MAN.
[1:45:00] &gt;&gt; NO SIR.
[1:45:01] &gt;&gt; OUR WEALTH IS COMING FROM GOD.
[1:45:03] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:45:04] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE GOD IS EVERYTHING FOR US.
[1:45:06] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:45:08] &gt;&gt; HE'S THE GOD THAT GIVE US THE HOLY
[1:45:10] GHOST.
[1:45:11] &gt;&gt; HE'S A GOD THAT GIVE US DIVINE HEALING.
[1:45:14] HE'S A GOD THAT GIVE US EVERYTHING.
[1:45:16] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:45:17] &gt;&gt; HE BLESSED JOHN CHARITY WITH CHILDREN.
[1:45:20] &gt;&gt; HE BLESS HIM BY HEALING HIM AND HE ALSO
[1:45:23] BLESS HIM FINANCIALLY.
[1:45:24] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:45:26] &gt;&gt; AND HE BLESS HIM BY GIVING HIM A WIFE.
[1:45:30] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:45:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:31] &gt;&gt; So let's go back where we were in
[1:45:33] proverb in Ecclesiastes.
[1:45:38] &gt;&gt; So where do we talk about prosperity?
[1:45:41] Forget about uh Elon Musk and whatever
[1:45:43] you think over there. Uhuh. We talking
[1:45:45] about the person of Jesus Christ.
[1:45:49] &gt;&gt; He's a prosperity to our spiritual life.
[1:45:53] &gt;&gt; Prosperity to our health,
[1:45:55] &gt;&gt; prosperity to our finances, prosperity
[1:45:57] to our marriages, PROSPERITY TO OUR
[1:46:00] CHILDREN IN SCHOOL, PROSPERITY TO OUR
[1:46:02] GRANDCHILDREN,
[1:46:03] &gt;&gt; PROSPERITY TO OUR FAMILIES
[1:46:08] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE HE'S THE SON OF PROSPERITY.
[1:46:11] NOT THE PROSPERITY OF LAISHA
[1:46:14] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THAT'S A PERVERSION.
[1:46:16] &gt;&gt; There must be an original one.
[1:46:18] &gt;&gt; SO WE ARE BRINGING YOU TO THE ORIGINAL
[1:46:20] ONE.
[1:46:22] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:46:26] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THE DEVIL BRING STUFF AND we
[1:46:28] think no this is our daily trial.
[1:46:33] &gt;&gt; Your daily trial have been going on for
[1:46:34] a long time.
[1:46:36] &gt;&gt; Since since you were young, it's still a
[1:46:38] daily trial.
[1:46:40] They got to have an ending to that daily
[1:46:42] trial.
[1:46:45] &gt;&gt; You got TO BREAK THE CIRCLE OF YOUR
[1:46:47] FAMILY
[1:46:50] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE YOU A DIFFERENT BREED
[1:46:52] &gt;&gt; UNDER A DIFFERENT FAMILY. THE BREED OF
[1:46:55] MECHISEDC,
[1:46:57] &gt;&gt; A DIFFERENT FAMILY LINE.
[1:47:01] &gt;&gt; I DON'T CARE WHAT HAPPENED TO MY MOTHER.
[1:47:04] I DON'T CARE WHAT HAPPENED TO MY AUNT. I
[1:47:06] DON'T CARE WHAT HAPPENED TO MY FATHER.
[1:47:08] BUT AS FOR ME AND MY HOUSE, WE STUDYING
[1:47:12] SOMETHING ELSE.
[1:47:21] &gt;&gt; IF PEOPLE DIVORCE, SO ME I HAVE TO
[1:47:23] DIVORCE. NO,
[1:47:24] &gt;&gt; I CANNOT DIVORCE. THE DEVIL MUST HAVE A
[1:47:27] DIFFERENT TUNE.
[1:47:29] &gt;&gt; THAT ENOUGH IS ENOUGH.
[1:47:32] &gt;&gt; NOT HERE.
[1:47:38] I HOPE WE ARE TOGETHER.
[1:47:40] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER?
[1:47:42] &gt;&gt; THIS SIDE is a little bit colder. I will
[1:47:43] send BROTHER KENNY TO SHOUT AMEN OVER
[1:47:45] THERE.
[1:47:54] &gt;&gt; Let's go to verse five.
[1:47:57] &gt;&gt; Uh verse uh 19. Chapter 5 verse 19.

[1:48:09] &gt;&gt; and has given him what?
[1:48:11] &gt;&gt; Power to eat thereof.
[1:48:12] &gt;&gt; SO GOD GIVE HIM FIRST WHAT?
[1:48:14] &gt;&gt; Riches and wealth.
[1:48:15] &gt;&gt; Riches and wealth.
[1:48:17] &gt;&gt; AND GOD GIVE HIM ALSO THE POWER TO ENJOY

[1:48:27] &gt;&gt; AND TO REJOICE IN WHAT?
[1:48:29] &gt;&gt; HIS LABOR.

[1:48:35] CAN YOU READ IT?
[1:48:36] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:48:36] &gt;&gt; THERE IS DIFFERENT GIFT OF GOD.
[1:48:39] &gt;&gt; THE HOLY GHOST IS A GIFT.
[1:48:41] &gt;&gt; IT'S A DIFFERENT GIFT. BUT THIS IS A
[1:48:44] DIFFERENT GIFT. A GIFT OF RICHES AND
[1:48:47] WEALTH AND THE ABILITY TO ENJOY IT.
[1:48:53] &gt;&gt; IN OTHER WORDS, IN OTHER WORD, MY GOD
[1:48:57] BLESS ME WITH A JOB
[1:48:58] &gt;&gt; AND I THANK HIM FOR IT. AND WHEN I GET
[1:49:01] MONEY FROM THAT JOB, I BUY A HOUSE AND I
[1:49:04] THANK GOD FOR IT. AND I BUY [screaming]
[1:49:06] A CAR AND I THANK GOD FOR IT. AND WHEN
[1:49:09] I'M DRIVING THAT CAR, I'M LISTENING TO
[1:49:12] THE MESSAGE OF THE HOUR, PRAISING GOD
[1:49:15] FOR THE CAR HE HAS GIVEN ME.

[1:49:49] &gt;&gt; And the ability to eat it come from God.
[1:49:52] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:49:52] &gt;&gt; AND WE HAVE TO TEACH THESE THINGS.
[1:49:55] &gt;&gt; SO WHEN YOU PRAY,
[1:49:57] &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW HOW TO PRAY. AMEN.
[1:50:00] &gt;&gt; IT IS NOT BAD TO ASK GOD FOR WHATEVER
[1:50:03] YOU WANT.
[1:50:04] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:50:10] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:50:12] &gt;&gt; I DON'T KNOW IF YOU UNDERSTANDING ME.
[1:50:14] &gt;&gt; I DON'T KNOW IF YOU UNDERSTANDING ME.

[1:50:23] &gt;&gt; ask her husband, I WANT A KISS. IS THAT
[1:50:26] A PROBLEM?
[1:50:27] &gt;&gt; NO. IS SHE WORLDLY?
[1:50:29] &gt;&gt; IF SHE WAS WORLDLY, WHY DID YOU MARRY
[1:50:31] HER?
[1:50:40] &gt;&gt; WHY DID YOU MARRY HER?
[1:50:42] &gt;&gt; YOU DID YOU MARRY A GHOST?
[1:50:45] [screaming]
[1:50:48] [cheering and applause]
[1:50:50] &gt;&gt; SO YOU ENTERING IN SOMETHING YOU DON'T
[1:50:52] EVEN KNOW.
[1:50:58] AND YOU TRY TO BRING SPIRITUAL
[1:51:01] &gt;&gt; STUFF INTO THAT.
[1:51:02] &gt;&gt; UH-UH. IT'S NOT SOMETHING ABOUT
[1:51:04] SPIRITUAL. DO WHAT YOU GOT TO DO.
[1:51:09] [applause]

[1:51:12] &gt;&gt; IF YOU KISS YOUR HUSBAND 20 TIMES AND
[1:51:15] ONE KISS THE HUSBAND ONE TIME, THE ONE
[1:51:18] THAT KISSES ONE TIME IS NOT MORE
[1:51:20] SPIRITUAL.
[1:51:23] AS A MATTER OF FACT, YOU THE ONE
[1:51:25] DEPRIVING YOURSELF.
[1:51:29] [applause]

[1:51:49] &gt;&gt; AND IT SHALL BE GIVEN UNTO YOU.
[1:51:51] &gt;&gt; IF I NEED IT, IT'S BETWEEN ME AND GOD.
[1:51:57] [cheering and applause]
[1:51:58] &gt;&gt; YOU ASK WHAT YOU WANT. LEAVE ME ALONE.
[1:52:01] &gt;&gt; LEAVE ME ALONE.
[1:52:02] &gt;&gt; THE PROBLEM WE WANT TO BRING EVERYBODY
[1:52:04] LIKE, "NO, NO, NO, NO. WE NEED TO ASK
[1:52:06] THE SAME THING." NO. ME AND YOU ARE NOT
[1:52:08] BORN THE SAME DAY.
[1:52:10] &gt;&gt; YOU ARE BORN DIFFERENT THAN ME. EVEN IF
[1:52:13] WE WERE BORN THE SAME DAY, YOU LOOK
[1:52:15] DIFFERENT THAN ME. SO LET ME BE WITH MY
[1:52:18] GOD WHAT I WANT TO BE.
[1:52:22] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:52:24] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:52:26] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.

[1:52:28] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:52:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:29] &gt;&gt; So when YOU PRAY, YOU DON'T ASK GOD
[1:52:31] SOMETHING like you hesitant.
[1:52:33] &gt;&gt; No. No. If I ask this, maybe I'm asking
[1:52:35] something wrong. No, no, no, no, no, no,
[1:52:37] no, no, no, no, no, no.
[1:52:39] &gt;&gt; He is the one that carth
[1:52:41] &gt;&gt; and taking care of all your need.
[1:52:45] THE BIBLE SAY HIS SUPPLIER, MY GOD SHALL
[1:52:48] SUPPLY
[1:52:50] &gt;&gt; SHALL SUPPLY WHAT?
[1:52:52] &gt;&gt; ALL MY NEEDS.

[1:52:57] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[1:52:58] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:52:59] &gt;&gt; SO GO ASK YOUR OWN NEED.
[1:53:02] &gt;&gt; And because we DON'T KNOW THIS, WE DON'T
[1:53:04] KNOW HOW TO APPROACH GOD.
[1:53:06] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:53:07] &gt;&gt; That's it. THAT'S IT RIGHT THERE.

[1:53:58] &gt;&gt; or not to blame BUT MOSTLY IT IS THE WAY
[1:54:01] THE PEOPLE ARE WHAT
[1:54:03] &gt;&gt; TAUGHT
[1:54:04] &gt;&gt; AND THE CHURCH WILL NEVER LEAVE WHAT
[1:54:07] &gt;&gt; HIGHER
[1:54:07] &gt;&gt; THEN IT PASTOR DOES WHAT?
[1:54:09] &gt;&gt; TEACHES.

[1:54:12] YOU DIDN'T GET THAT WELL.
[1:54:16] &gt;&gt; THE CHURCH WILL LIVE WHAT?
[1:54:18] &gt;&gt; NEVER LIVE HIGHER.
[1:54:19] &gt;&gt; NOTHING HIGHER THAN WHAT
[1:54:20] &gt;&gt; THE PASTOR TEACHES.
[1:54:22] &gt;&gt; SO WE GOT TO RAISE THE STANDARD.
[1:54:34] [laughter]
[1:54:35] &gt;&gt; BROTHER BRHAM SAYS I won't get into this
[1:54:39] again. HE SAID YOU WHAT
[1:54:41] &gt;&gt; SELDOM FIND IT.

[1:54:47] &gt;&gt; a good SON SAID WHAT
[1:54:51] &gt;&gt; GOSPEL TEACHER

[1:55:03] &gt;&gt; SOME OF YOUR PROBLEM CAME FROM YOUR
[1:55:05] PREVIOUS PASTOR.
[1:55:11] BECAUSE YOU WERE TAUGH SIN WHEN THERE
[1:55:14] WAS NO SIN.
[1:55:16] &gt;&gt; YOU WERE TOLD WRONG WHEN IT WAS NOTHING
[1:55:18] WRONG.
[1:55:20] &gt;&gt; AND YOU CAN'T CLIMB HIGHER [screaming]
[1:55:21] THAN THAT.
[1:55:28] &gt;&gt; HOW [screaming] CAN I BE A PASTOR? HOW
[1:55:30] CAN I BE A PASTOR AND I'M PROSPERING AND
[1:55:33] THE PEOPLE IN MY CHURCH ARE SUFFERING
[1:55:35] &gt;&gt; AND I'M I'M HAPPY. NO, I MUST PRAY FOR
[1:55:38] YOU. YES, SIR.
[1:55:39] &gt;&gt; THE ANOINTING [screaming] COME FROM THE
[1:55:41] HEAD OF AARON. IT DOESN'T STOP IN THE
[1:55:44] HEAD. IT DROP TO THE CLOTHING ALL THE

[1:56:35] &gt;&gt; about what

[1:56:42] &gt;&gt; That's why we get so jealous in
[1:56:43] denominational sir
[1:56:45] &gt;&gt; because they go straight to God
[1:56:49] &gt;&gt; and THEY ARE NOT WIVES THEY ARE CONCUBAN

[2:06:15] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:06:16] &gt;&gt; Let's go to our third scripture.
[2:06:22] Let's go to Matthew 6.
[2:06:27] &gt;&gt; I don't know if I will even get where
[2:06:29] I'm trying to go
[2:06:30] &gt;&gt; because we need to clear and straighten
[2:06:32] up these things.
[2:06:34] &gt;&gt; These are scripture that minister used
[2:06:36] before and corner and corner until we
[2:06:39] are even afraid to talk about finances
[2:06:42] with somebody

[2:06:45] WORLDLY.
[2:06:48] YOU DON'T know how to talk to the
[2:06:49] brother. You say, "Brother, I'm
[2:06:50] struggling. Can you can I find a job?"
[2:06:52] You You No, no, no, brother. You need to
[2:06:54] talk. Ask the Holy Ghost. Ask uh

[2:07:29] &gt;&gt; The Bible say his name became great by
[2:07:32] the by the fulfillment of his promises.
[2:07:34] So the more God is fulfilling, the more
[2:07:37] he's anchoring you.
[2:07:39] &gt;&gt; [applause and cheering]
[2:07:42] &gt;&gt; He made his name great in Pharaoh by
[2:07:44] doing what?
[2:07:45] &gt;&gt; By doing miracle and and and and and
[2:07:48] stuff in Egypt and his name goes up
[2:07:54] &gt;&gt; because Pharaoh say who is that God?
[2:07:56] &gt;&gt; And so the GOD HAVE TO SHOW UP.
[2:07:59] &gt;&gt; You believe the message you're telling.
[2:08:00] ARE WE WILLING TO SEE YOUR GOD?

[2:08:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:08:14] &gt;&gt; Let's go to Matthew 6
[2:08:16] &gt;&gt; verse 19.
[2:08:18] &gt;&gt; Ah Lord, help me.
[2:08:25] &gt;&gt; We need to strengthen all of these
[2:08:27] things
[2:08:29] &gt;&gt; because I'm trying to get all the way to
[2:08:31] the rich young ruler

[2:08:35] you on the head with it. It is not It is
[2:08:37] difficult for those who have money to

[2:08:44] going to read it.
[2:08:48] &gt;&gt; And you come up with what the scripture
[2:08:50] say
[2:08:50] &gt;&gt; and I show you what the prophet say.
[2:08:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:08:55] &gt;&gt; Matthew 6 verse 19.
[2:09:02] The clergy children are prospering. They

[2:09:07] congregation are suffering.

[2:09:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's exactly right.
[2:09:20] &gt;&gt; Bring your tithing. Tithing come from
[2:09:22] work.
[2:09:23] &gt;&gt; Bless the people at work. They bring
[2:09:25] their t.
[2:09:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:09:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:09:31] And God say take your t. What do you do
[2:09:33] with
[2:09:33] &gt;&gt; ting?
[2:09:34] &gt;&gt; Spiritual stuff.
[2:09:39] &gt;&gt; I'm asking you a question. When you go
[2:09:40] to Walmart, you you buying spiritual
[2:09:43] water.
[2:09:50] [laughter]
[2:09:51] &gt;&gt; Matthew 6 verse 19. If you dare, you can
[2:09:54] say amen.
[2:09:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:09:55] &gt;&gt; The Bible say what?
[2:09:57] &gt;&gt; Lay not up for yourselves. Uh-huh.
[2:09:59] Treasures upon earth. Ah,
[2:10:02] you see
[2:10:03] &gt;&gt; you see.
[2:10:05] &gt;&gt; YOU SEE? LAY NOT UP TREASURE FOR THE
[2:10:08] EARTH.
[2:10:09] &gt;&gt; UHHUH.
[2:10:11] &gt;&gt; OH, say amen. It's the word.
[2:10:14] &gt;&gt; Ah, it's the word.
[2:10:16] &gt;&gt; LAY NOT UP TREASURE where
[2:10:18] &gt;&gt; upon earth.
[2:10:19] &gt;&gt; Where? What?
[2:10:20] &gt;&gt; Moth and rust doth corrupt.
[2:10:22] &gt;&gt; And where the thieves break through and
[2:10:24] do what?
[2:10:25] &gt;&gt; Steal. So Jesus is telling us that DO
[2:10:28] NOT
[2:10:29] &gt;&gt; [screaming]
[2:10:29] &gt;&gt; UH UH PILE UP
[2:10:32] &gt;&gt; WEALTH ON this earth here
[2:10:34] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE SOMEBODY CAN BREAK TO YOUR
[2:10:36] WEALTH and pick it up and go with it.
[2:10:38] THIS IS that save the Lord from Jesus
[2:10:40] Christ.
[2:10:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:10:42] &gt;&gt; And all the rust can affect your or the
[2:10:45] mouth and and destroy the things that
[2:10:48] you're piling up.
[2:10:51] &gt;&gt; It is that safe the Lord.
[2:10:55] You see the problem is they give you one
[2:10:57] side of the scripture
[2:10:59] &gt;&gt; and they don't give the other. Me I give
[2:11:01] you both.
[2:11:02] &gt;&gt; SO LET'S SEE HOW BOTH OF THEM MUST
[2:11:04] COMBINE.
[2:11:08] &gt;&gt; If not it's like a contradiction. This
[2:11:11] one says this. This preacher said we
[2:11:13] need to take both quote and put it
[2:11:14] together. Both scripture and put IT
[2:11:16] TOGETHER. JESUS SAID DO NOT PILE UP.
[2:11:20] do not pile up riches
[2:11:24] on earth
[2:11:26] the God that blessed Solomon.
[2:11:29] &gt;&gt; We going to get to Solomon soon.
[2:11:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:11:32] &gt;&gt; Where thieves can enter and this and
[2:11:35] this and this. We clear.
[2:11:37] &gt;&gt; So when you working, DO NOT PILE UP.
[2:11:40] &gt;&gt; Next verse.
[2:11:43] [laughter]
[2:11:44] &gt;&gt; LET'S GO, MY FRIEND. BUT WHAT

[2:12:10] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:12:11] &gt;&gt; I can have deed and all type of stuff. I
[2:12:13] know what to do. Now, Jesus saying on
[2:12:15] the earth, don't do that.

[2:22:01] SOLOMON IS DOING WORK AND BROTHER SAY
[2:22:04] EVERYTHING THAT WAS GOING ON WAS working
[2:22:07] &gt;&gt; because he WAS A SEASON.
[2:22:09] &gt;&gt; GOD CAME TO VISIT THE PEOPLE
[2:22:11] &gt;&gt; IN A man called Solomon
[2:22:14] &gt;&gt; EXPRESSING HIS WISDOM THROUGH A MAN.
[2:22:17] &gt;&gt; Are we together? AND THEN THE ENTIRE
[2:22:19] WORLD WAS COMING FOR SOLOMON. AND ISRAEL
[2:22:22] RECOGNIZED THE GIFT THAT GOD SENT IN
[2:22:24] SOLOMON.

[2:22:31] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE IF YOU RECEIVE A PROPHET IN THE
[2:22:33] NAME OF A PROPHET, YOU MUST RECEIVE THE
[2:22:36] REWARD OF A PROPHET.
[2:22:39] &gt;&gt; Are we together?

[2:22:55] &gt;&gt; A levy
[2:22:57] here I know levy sometime they use it
[2:22:59] for taxes but here a levy is called a
[2:23:03] force labor.

[2:23:11] &gt;&gt; I hope we're getting now.
[2:23:13] &gt;&gt; Are we there?
[2:23:15] &gt;&gt; Are we there?
[2:23:16] And the Bible say they want the Bible is
[2:23:19] trying to give us the reason why Solomon
[2:23:22] used force labor
[2:23:25] &gt;&gt; because prosperity IS EVERYWHERE.
[2:23:27] &gt;&gt; BUT IN THE MIDST OF THAT PROSPERITY,
[2:23:29] SOLOMON COME with a force labor.
[2:23:32] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:23:33] &gt;&gt; The Bible say and this is the reason of
[2:23:36] the levy which King Solomon raised for

[2:25:25] COLLECTED ALL THE CHILDREN OF THOSE

[2:36:41] THE KING,
[2:36:42] &gt;&gt; IT WAS TRUE REPORT THAT I DID WHAT?
[2:36:46] &gt;&gt; Heard in mine own land.

[2:36:50] &gt;&gt; Thy acts
[2:36:51] &gt;&gt; and what?
[2:36:51] &gt;&gt; And of THY WISDOM.
[2:36:52] &gt;&gt; HOWEVER,
[2:36:54] &gt;&gt; I BELIEVE NOT THE WORD
[2:36:56] &gt;&gt; UNTIL I DID WHAT?
[2:36:58] &gt;&gt; I CAME
[2:36:58] &gt;&gt; AND DO WHAT? Mine eyes had seen it.
[2:37:01] &gt;&gt; And what?
[2:37:01] &gt;&gt; And behold, the half was NOT TOLD.
[2:37:03] &gt;&gt; IN OTHER WORDS, WHAT WAS GOING ON WAS
[2:37:05] NOT EVEN TRULY EXACTLY WHAT WAS going on
[2:37:08] there.
[2:37:09] &gt;&gt; AMEN. THE HALF HAS NOT BEEN TOLD.
[2:37:12] &gt;&gt; YOUR WISDOM AND WHAT?
[2:37:14] &gt;&gt; PROSPERITY.
[2:37:15] &gt;&gt; That's what
[2:37:16] &gt;&gt; exceedth the fame WHICH I HEARD.
[2:37:18] &gt;&gt; HAPPY ARE YOUR MAN. HAPPY ARE THESE WHO
[2:37:22] &gt;&gt; THY servants

[2:37:25] &gt;&gt; AND TH WHAT?
[2:37:26] &gt;&gt; THY WISDOM.
[2:37:27] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER?
[2:37:28] SO THE QUEEN OF SHEBA
[2:37:31] &gt;&gt; TESTIFY THAT SOLOMON WAS DIFFERENT.
[2:37:37] &gt;&gt; THE LIFE OF THE JEWS WAS COMPLETELY
[2:37:40] DIFFERENT.
[2:37:41] &gt;&gt; GOD LOVED HIS PEOPLE SO MUCH.
[2:37:43] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:37:44] &gt;&gt; READ IN verse 9.
[2:37:46] &gt;&gt; The Queen of Sheba say what?
[2:37:47] &gt;&gt; Blessed be the Lord thy God.
[2:37:49] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.
[2:37:50] &gt;&gt; Which delighted in thee.
[2:37:51] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.
[2:37:51] &gt;&gt; To set thee on the throne over of
[2:37:54] Israel.
[2:37:54] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. Because the Lord loved Israel
[2:37:56] forever.
[2:37:57] &gt;&gt; Because the Lord loved Israel for what?
[2:37:59] &gt;&gt; Forever.
[2:38:00] &gt;&gt; Therefore made he WHAT? KING
[2:38:02] &gt;&gt; TO DO WHAT?
[2:38:03] &gt;&gt; JUDGMENT.
[2:38:04] &gt;&gt; IN OTHER WORDS, WHAT I SEE HERE IS AN
[2:38:06] EXPRESSION OF THE LOVE OF GOD FOR THE
[2:38:08] JEWS.
[2:38:09] &gt;&gt; GOD LOVED THE JEWS SO MUCH TO GIVE THEM
[2:38:12] SUCH A GREAT GIFT.
[2:38:13] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:38:14] &gt;&gt; ARE we together?

[2:38:21] &gt;&gt; and what?
[2:38:21] &gt;&gt; And of spices very great store.
[2:38:23] &gt;&gt; Uh-huh. and precious stones.
[2:38:25] &gt;&gt; There came no more such abundance of
[2:38:28] spices as these which the Queen of Sheba
[2:38:30] gave King [music] to King Solomon.
[2:38:31] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER?
[2:38:34] &gt;&gt; I I DIDN'T write the Bible. I'm just
[2:38:35] responsible to READ THE BIBLE. SO THERE
[2:38:38] WAS NO SPICES BROUGHT LIKE THE QUEEN.
[2:38:40] DID SOLOMON ASK FOR IT? [screaming]
[2:38:46] &gt;&gt; Who was bringing that?
[2:38:49] &gt;&gt; WHO WAS BRINGING THAT?
[2:38:50] &gt;&gt; Queen of Sheba.
[2:38:51] &gt;&gt; She the queen OF WHAT?

[2:38:55] OF SOLOMON, EVERYBODY WAS EATING,
[2:38:59] &gt;&gt; DRINKING, making merry, PEACEFUL TIME,
[2:39:02] MONEY FLOWING EVERYWHERE,

[2:43:18] THIS IS WHAT happened in the morning.
[2:43:20] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. THE BIBLE SAY IN EXODUS
[2:43:23] 32:6, "AND THEY ROSE UP HOW?"
[2:43:26] &gt;&gt; EARLY ON THE TOMORROW,
[2:43:28] &gt;&gt; not late in THE MORNING. THEY ROSE UP

[2:44:51] &gt;&gt; BUT THE LABOR [screaming] WAS ONLY A
[2:44:54] MEMORIAL.
[2:44:55] &gt;&gt; THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT.

[2:45:08] that scripture. HE SAY OH YOU SAY I
[2:45:11] THANK GOD I'M NOT WHAT?
[2:45:12] &gt;&gt; AN IDOLTOR.
[2:45:13] &gt;&gt; WAIT JUST A MINUTE. LET'S EXAMINE IT BY
[2:45:16] THE WHAT?
[2:45:16] &gt;&gt; The word.

[2:45:37] IT'S AN [screaming] IDOLATRY.
[2:45:45] &gt;&gt; IS THAT TOO STRONG?

[2:45:47] &gt;&gt; BROTHER BRANDHAM SAY SITTING AND DOING
[2:45:49] WHAT?

[2:46:03] &gt;&gt; SO TO KEEP ISRAEL FROM GOING THAT LINE,
[2:46:07] SOLOMON COUPLED THE LIFE WITH WORK.
[2:46:12] &gt;&gt; GOD IS BLESSING.
[2:46:14] &gt;&gt; BUT YOU MUST BE DILIGENT WITH WORK.
[2:46:18] &gt;&gt; YOU NEED A DISCIPLINE WITH WORK.

[2:49:33] &gt;&gt; AND WE CALL THAT LIBERTY.
[2:49:37] AMEN.
[2:49:39] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:49:40] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:49:42] &gt;&gt; SO GOD CREATED THE HEAVEN AND EARTH.
[2:49:45] &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT.
[2:49:46] &gt;&gt; AND THE HEAVEN AND THE EARTH BELONGS TO
[2:49:49] GOD.
[2:49:50] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:49:52] &gt;&gt; AND GOD DECIDED IN HIMSELF
[2:49:55] &gt;&gt; THAT I AM GOING TO TAKE THE earth and
[2:49:58] give it to man. It's written in your
[2:50:00] Bible.
[2:50:01] &gt;&gt; AND THE BIBLE SAY GOD GAVE THE EARTH TO
[2:50:03] MAN. THAT'S WHY WHEN GOD CREATED MAN in
[2:50:07] the garden of Eden, he begin TO GIVE MAN
[2:50:10] THE INSTRUCTION FOR HIS PROPERTY.
[2:50:12] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:50:13] &gt;&gt; HE SAID BE FRUITFUL,
[2:50:15] &gt;&gt; MULTIPLY AND HAVE WHAT
[2:50:17] &gt;&gt; DOMINION OVER WATER
[2:50:19] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THE RESPONSIBLE THE ONE WHO HAVE
[2:50:22] THE TA
[2:50:24] &gt;&gt; THE PAPERWORK SIR
[2:50:26] &gt;&gt; THE TITLE OF THE EARTH
[2:50:29] &gt;&gt; WAS GIVEN TO MAN.
[2:50:30] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:50:31] &gt;&gt; THE ORIGINAL OWNER WAS GOD. AMEN.
[2:50:34] &gt;&gt; I HOPE WE TOGETHER.
[2:50:35] &gt;&gt; AND GOD GAVE IT TO MAN.
[2:50:39] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER?
[2:50:40] &gt;&gt; BUT MAN THAT WAS GIVEN THE TITLE HAD A
[2:50:44] FREE MORAL AGENCY.
[2:50:46] &gt;&gt; I hope we ARE TOGETHER.
[2:50:48] &gt;&gt; AND GOD [screaming]
[2:50:49] NEVER LEFT MAN ALONE.
[2:50:57] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE ADAM [screaming] WAS PERFECT.
[2:50:59] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:51:00] &gt;&gt; ADAM WAS UNDER PERFECTION. BUT EVEN
[2:51:03] THOUGH ADAM WAS UNDER PERFECTION, EVERY
[2:51:06] EVENING,
[2:51:09] &gt;&gt; I HOPE WE ARE FOLLOWING ME. EVERY
[2:51:12] EVENING, [screaming]
[2:51:13] &gt;&gt; GOD WAS COMING DOWN TO TALK TO ADAM
[2:51:17] BECAUSE A FREE MORAL [screaming] AGENCY
[2:51:20] NEED CONTROL.
[2:51:27] I'M I'M MANEUVERING THE AIRPLANE, MY
[2:51:29] FRIEND. ARE WE TOGETHER? ARE WE
[2:51:32] TOGETHER?
[2:51:33] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? YOU CAN NEVER LIVE
[2:51:35] [screaming] WITHOUT CONTROL.
[2:51:38] &gt;&gt; IT'S A DANGEROUS GAME.
[2:51:42] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[2:51:47] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[2:51:49] &gt;&gt; Are we banned in this country?
[2:51:51] &gt;&gt; No.
[2:51:51] &gt;&gt; We are a free country.
[2:51:53] &gt;&gt; Does it mean you can cross the red
[2:51:55] light?
[2:51:56] &gt;&gt; So, you're not free as you think.
[2:52:01] THEY TELL YOU YOU'RE FREE, BUT YOU'RE
[2:52:03] NOT FREE.
[2:52:04] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE IF YOU PRAY, THE CONSTITUTION is
[2:52:06] above you.
[2:52:07] &gt;&gt; THEY PUT A POLICE OFFICER ON THE
[2:52:08] HIGHWAY. YOU CANNOT DRIVE ANYWHERE YOU
[2:52:11] WANT TO.
[2:52:12] &gt;&gt; SO YOU WILL NOT FREE THE WAY YOU THINK.
[2:52:15] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THEY KNOW THAT MAN WITH A FREE
[2:52:18] MORAL AGENCY ALWAYS NEEDED A
[2:52:21] SUPERVISION.
[2:52:25] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[2:52:26] &gt;&gt; Yes sir. Amen. I hope we are together.
[2:52:29] &gt;&gt; I HOPE WE ARE TOGETHER. I DON'T CARE HOW
[2:52:32] MUCH HOLY GHOST brother Charles have.
[2:52:36] &gt;&gt; And he does have the Holy Ghost and he's
[2:52:38] filled WITH THE HOLY GHOST UNTIL HIS
[2:52:40] HAIR have the Holy Ghost.
[2:52:44] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:52:45] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? BUT IF I HAND A
[2:52:48] BUSINESS TO BROTHER Charles
[2:52:50] &gt;&gt; and LET HIM ALONE, DON'T EVEN GIVE HIM
[2:52:52] AN AUDIT,
[2:52:53] &gt;&gt; I WILL DESTROY HIM.
[2:52:55] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[2:52:56] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[2:52:58] IT IS NOT HIM DESTROYING HIMSELF. MY
[2:53:01] LACK OF SUPERVISION
[2:53:03] &gt;&gt; WILL PUT THE BROTHER IN TROUBLE.
[2:53:10] &gt;&gt; You didn't get me well.
[2:53:11] &gt;&gt; You get me well.
[2:53:12] &gt;&gt; IN OTHER WORDS, BROTHER CHARLES, THE
[2:53:14] FIRST WEEK I DON'T COME.
[2:53:16] &gt;&gt; I don't ask him accountability for
[2:53:18] anything.
[2:53:19] &gt;&gt; ONE MONTH I DON'T ASK him accountability
[2:53:21] for anything. Guess what? If brother
[2:53:23] Charles is hungry, he might go for one
[2:53:27] month he's going on break time,
[2:53:29] &gt;&gt; but after a while.
[2:53:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:53:32] &gt;&gt; YOU WILL SEE BROTHER CHARLES BEGIN TO
[2:53:34] WORK WITH HIS cell phone.
[2:53:37] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:53:39] &gt;&gt; I'M THE ONE THAT CREATED THAT.
[2:53:42] &gt;&gt; Have I SAID SOMETHING WRONG?
[2:53:44] &gt;&gt; BEFORE YOU KNOW IT, BROTHER CHARLES IS
[2:53:46] LIKE THIS.
[2:53:47] &gt;&gt; BEFORE YOU KNOW IT, BROTHER CHARLES IS
[2:53:49] SO HUNGRY AND HE SAY, "YOU KNOW WHAT?
[2:53:51] BECAUSE I'M so hungry, what can I do? My
[2:53:54] lunch is at 1:00. Uh-uh. I'm so hungry.
[2:53:57] He never come to even check me anyway. I
[2:53:59] can do whatever I want. Let me close the
[2:54:01] shop and go get something and hamburger
[2:54:03] right here and COME BACK TOGETHER. ALL
[2:54:06] THAT BEHAVIOR is created because of lack
[2:54:09] of control.
[2:54:10] &gt;&gt; BUT IF BROTHER CHARLES KNOWS THAT A
[2:54:12] SUPERVISOR IS AROUND,
[2:54:16] &gt;&gt; HIS CELL PHONE IS IN THE POCKET. IF HE
[2:54:20] WANT TO TOUCH, HE NEED TO GO TO THE
[2:54:21] BATHROOM. EVEN IF HE'S HUNGRY, HE WON'T
[2:54:24] EAT UNTIL BREAK TIME BECAUSE YOU NEED
[2:54:27] CONTROL.
[2:54:31] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER?
[2:54:32] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:54:33] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY MARRIED PEOPLE PERFORM BETTER
[2:54:36] THAN SINGLES.
[2:54:42] &gt;&gt; I'M HEADING TOWARD THE AIRPORT. THAT'S
[2:54:44] WHY MARRIED BROTHER PERFORM BETTER THAN
[2:54:47] SINGLESMEN
[2:54:48] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THE WIFE IS UNDER CONTROL.
[2:54:51] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:54:52] &gt;&gt; WHEN YOU FINISH JOB, WHERE ARE YOU AT?
[2:54:55] &gt;&gt; YOU NEED TO COME BACK AT HOME.
[2:54:58] &gt;&gt; WHEN THEY ASK YOU WHERE [screaming] ARE
[2:54:59] YOU AT, THEY'RE NOT REALLY ASKING YOU
[2:55:01] WHERE ARE YOU AT.
[2:55:02] &gt;&gt; THEY ASKING YOU WHAT IS THE REASON WHY
[2:55:04] YOU [screaming] NOT HOME.
[2:55:11] &gt;&gt; I HOPE WE TOGETHER. SO HE BEGIN TO
[2:55:13] STRUCTURE YOUR TIME. IT BEGIN TO PROTECT
[2:55:16] YOU FROM ACCIDENT BECAUSE YOU NEED THAT
[2:55:20] [screaming] SUPERVISION
[2:55:21] YOUNG PEOPLE. YOU NEED THE SUPERVISION.

[2:55:31] &gt;&gt; I don't know if you get it.
[2:55:33] &gt;&gt; I don't know if you get it. When you
[2:55:35] leave under your father,
[2:55:37] &gt;&gt; you you leave your father, you go into
[2:55:39] the supervision of your spouse. Amen.
[2:55:41] &gt;&gt; When you leave from your spouse, you go
[2:55:43] to work, the supervisor is there.
[2:55:45] &gt;&gt; Because if there is no supervisor, no
[2:55:47] work.
[2:55:48] &gt;&gt; EVERYBODY'S SLACKING.
[2:55:50] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:55:51] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:55:51] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:55:52] &gt;&gt; SO, CONTROL IS A BLESSING.
[2:55:56] &gt;&gt; YES, IT IS.
[2:55:58] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:55:59] &gt;&gt; AND I'M HEADING STRAIGHT TO THE AIRPORT.
[2:56:01] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:56:01] &gt;&gt; CONTROL IS A BLESSING.
[2:56:03] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:56:03] &gt;&gt; IT IS IMPORTANT FOR THE DEACON TO KNOW
[2:56:06] WHERE YOU ARE
[2:56:07] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE HE KEEP YOU BACK IN THE FLOCK.
[2:56:10] AMEN.
[2:56:10] &gt;&gt; IT IS IMPORTANT FOR YOUR BROTHER TO KNOW
[2:56:13] WHAT HAPPENED WITH YOU.
[2:56:14] &gt;&gt; IT KEEP YOU CLOSER TOGETHER. [cheering]
[2:56:17] &gt;&gt; WE ARE NOT BUSY BODY,
[2:56:19] &gt;&gt; BUT YOU NEED ONE ANOTHER.
[2:56:24] [applause and cheering]
[2:56:25] &gt;&gt; I'M HEADING STRAIGHT TO THE AIRPORT, MY
[2:56:27] FRIEND. I'M GOING TO LAY THE TARMAC. I'M
[2:56:30] GOING TO HIT THE TARMAC. Are we
[2:56:31] together?
[2:56:32] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:56:34] &gt;&gt; I have a question. Brother Charles is
[2:56:36] right here.
[2:56:38] &gt;&gt; Sorry, brother Charles. Today I pick on
[2:56:39] you so much. Brother Tony's right here.
[2:56:41] [laughter]
[2:56:42] Are we together? Brother Tony's right
[2:56:44] here. Are we together? If I told Brother
[2:56:47] Tony, I say, "Brother Tony, go ahead and
[2:56:49] give me a report right now and uh make
[2:56:52] sure uh you give me a report whenever
[2:56:54] you can give me a report."
[2:56:57] &gt;&gt; That report may take three months.
[2:57:01] &gt;&gt; That's right. [screaming]
[2:57:02] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together
[2:57:04] &gt;&gt; because brother Steven say whenever you
[2:57:06] can.
[2:57:06] &gt;&gt; Whenever
[2:57:09] I hope we are together.
[2:57:11] &gt;&gt; BUT IF I TELL BROTHER TONY BY WEDNESDAY,
[2:57:14] &gt;&gt; IF THE REPORT IS NOT THERE, YOU GET
[2:57:17] FIRED.
[2:57:18] &gt;&gt; A NEW TONY WILL COME UP.
[2:57:22] [cheering]
[2:57:26] &gt;&gt; I don't know IF YOU'RE GETTING ME. A NEW
[2:57:28] TONY WILL COME UP
[2:57:30] &gt;&gt; AND THAT TONY WILL BEGIN TO PERFORM
[2:57:33] POWERFULLY.
[2:57:37] YOU DIDN'T GET ME.
[2:57:39] &gt;&gt; SOME OF YOU ARE STRUGGLING WITH ME.
[2:57:41] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER?

[2:57:44] &gt;&gt; AMEN. I'm circling the airport, my
[2:57:47] friend. Let me start it again. If I tell
[2:57:49] brother Tony right now, I say you
[2:57:52] employee whenever you can send me that
[2:57:54] report.
[2:57:55] &gt;&gt; Probably I have to remind him
[2:57:59] &gt;&gt; like, "Hey, hey, hey, hey, it has been a
[2:58:00] while. You forget about the reminder
[2:58:02] &gt;&gt; because by the time you will look up and
[2:58:04] say you know what he says whenever I can

[2:58:26] FIRED. EVEN IF HE NEED TO GO TO THE
[2:58:29] RESTAURANT, HE PUSHES THE RESTAURANT
[2:58:31] AWAY.
[2:58:33] &gt;&gt; EVEN IF HE'S SLEEPY, BROTHER TONY WILL
[2:58:35] PUSH THE SLEEPNESS AWAY.
[2:58:38] &gt;&gt; ANOTHER TONY WILL COME UP TO HANDLE THE
[2:58:41] SITUATION AND HE WILL PERFORM CORRECTLY
[2:58:46] TO MAKE SURE BY MONDAY EVERYTHING IS
[2:58:48] THERE. THAT'S WHY YOU NEED PRESSURE
[2:58:52] &gt;&gt; TO BRING THE BEST OF YOU OUT.
[2:58:58] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[2:59:00] [cheering]
[2:59:01] &gt;&gt; YOU GOING TO MAKE ME CIRCLE THE AIRPORT
[2:59:03] AGAIN.
[2:59:04] &gt;&gt; Let me start it again. LET ME START IT
[2:59:06] AGAIN. THERE ARE SOME OF US WHO ARE
[2:59:09] AVERAGE.
[2:59:15] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:59:17] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:59:18] &gt;&gt; If they say produce 10,
[2:59:21] &gt;&gt; they will produce 10 and stop.
[2:59:23] &gt;&gt; I don't know if you get me. By seven
[2:59:26] they begin to get tired.
[2:59:31] &gt;&gt; IF YOU SAY PRODUCE WHAT YOU CAN,
[2:59:34] &gt;&gt; they will produce three
[2:59:37] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE YOU SAY WHATEVER YOU CAN.
[2:59:39] &gt;&gt; SO A WORK THEY PUT A quarter
[2:59:42] &gt;&gt; they put a limit they say you must
[2:59:44] produce TILL THIS.
[2:59:46] &gt;&gt; SO WHEN THEY SAY THAT AN AVERAGE
[2:59:48] EMPLOYEE HAVE THE TENDENCY TO MEET THAT
[2:59:52] LEVEL AND GIVE UP. THAT'S WHY YOU WILL
[2:59:55] NEVER GET A PROMOTION.
[3:00:01] &gt;&gt; WHAT THEY ARE DOING, THEY ARE STRETCHING
[3:00:03] YOU UP.
[3:00:05] &gt;&gt; THEY ARE OPENING YOUR QUALITY, YOUR
[3:00:08] POTENTIAL.
[3:00:08] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[3:00:09] &gt;&gt; BUT A ONE WHO HAVE A VISION.
[3:00:12] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[3:00:13] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[3:00:14] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[3:00:15] &gt;&gt; WHEN THEY SAY PRODUCE 10, HE'S GOING TO
[3:00:18] PRODUCE 15. HE'S TRYING TO IMPRESS THE
[3:00:22] SUPERVISOR.
[3:00:22] &gt;&gt; AMEN. THAT I CAN GO BEYOND AND IF THEY
[3:00:26] NEED TO GIVE SOMEBODY PROMOTION
[3:00:27] [screaming] THAT'S THE ONE THAT GET A
[3:00:28] PROMOTION.
[3:00:32] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[3:00:33] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[3:00:33] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER?
[3:00:34] &gt;&gt; SO YOU NEED SOME PRESSURE TO SET TO TO
[3:00:37] TO WAKE YOU UP
[3:00:41] &gt;&gt; AND TO MAKE YOU PERFORM AT YOUR LEVEL
[3:00:46] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE WE ARE PERFORMING UNDER OUR
[3:00:48] LEVEL.
[3:00:54] I hope we are together.
[3:00:56] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. [laughter]
[3:00:59] &gt;&gt; When I was uh in college,
[3:01:02] we study small like this. You get a
[3:01:04] test. You can memorize even the book.
[3:01:07] &gt;&gt; You can memorize the book.
[3:01:09] &gt;&gt; No problem.
[3:01:10] &gt;&gt; When I get to dental school, it was a
[3:01:11] different game.
[3:01:13] &gt;&gt; What we study for the final in the in
[3:01:16] the college,
[3:01:17] &gt;&gt; it was for one week.
[3:01:20] The whole semester in college is taught
[3:01:22] in one week. [applause]
[3:01:26] &gt;&gt; On Monday a 100 slat.
[3:01:29] &gt;&gt; On Wednesday they add 60 slat.
[3:01:31] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[3:01:32] &gt;&gt; On Friday they add 87 slide.
[3:01:35] &gt;&gt; So you know how many sl you already have
[3:01:37] for one week but the test is not yet.
[3:01:39] The test is in two month.
[3:01:42] &gt;&gt; That's one course and you have eight
[3:01:44] classes that are coming up like that.
[3:01:45] &gt;&gt; So you sit down you say how do you study
[3:01:48] this now? Before
[3:01:50] you know it, you find yourself studying
[3:01:53] everything and being on top of it.
[3:01:55] &gt;&gt; What happened? Your nerve have opened
[3:01:58] up.
[3:01:59] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen.
[3:02:00] &gt;&gt; And I learned that in school. Your nerve
[3:02:01] open up. The more they push, the more
[3:02:03] the demand is, the more you develop.
[3:02:07] &gt;&gt; That's true.
[3:02:08] &gt;&gt; And what you were not using to to do
[3:02:11] used to do two months ago, you can begin
[3:02:14] to do it because they put you in the
[3:02:16] mir.
[3:02:18] Because if they don't put you in that
[3:02:19] mode, you will never perform the same
[3:02:21] way.
[3:02:23] &gt;&gt; That's true.
[3:02:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:02:24] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[3:02:25] &gt;&gt; Are we together? And you think the devil
[3:02:27] is pushing, is pushing, is pushing. It
[3:02:29] is God trying to wake you up.
[3:02:32] &gt;&gt; AND SAY YOU CAN DO BETTER THAN WHAT YOU
[3:02:34] THINK. YOU CAN DO BETTER THAN WHAT YOU
[3:02:36] THINK. YOU CAN DO BETTER THAN WHAT YOU
[3:02:39] THINK. UNTIL ONE DAY, YOU WILL WAKE UP
[3:02:41] LIKE A SHAM.
[3:02:44] YES SIR.
[3:02:45] &gt;&gt; AND WHEN SOME GUY WOKE UP, HE DIDN'T
[3:02:48] LOOK AT ONE MAN AGAINST 600. HE FORGOT
[3:02:51] ABOUT WHO HE WAS AND HE TACKLED 600
[3:02:54] PEOPLE AND BEAT THEM ALL
[3:02:56] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE HE WAS MORE THAN A CONQUEROR.
[3:03:01] &gt;&gt; I hope we ARE TOGETHER. THE CONTROL IS
[3:03:04] NOT TO BLOCK YOUR LIBERTY. IT IS TO
[3:03:06] REFOCUS YOUR ENERGY AND TO BRING YOU TO
[3:03:09] THE RIGHT PATH SO YOU CAN DEVELOP AND
[3:03:12] PRODUCE MORE. AMEN.
[3:03:14] &gt;&gt; IF THERE IS NO PRESSURE, NO [screaming]
[3:03:15] PRODUCTION.
[3:03:16] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[3:03:18] [applause]
[3:03:18] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[3:03:20] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[3:03:21] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[3:03:21] &gt;&gt; LET ME STOP RIGHT HERE.
[3:03:23] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[3:03:26] &gt;&gt; Let me pause right here. Go home
[3:03:29] &gt;&gt; and ponder this.
[3:03:31] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[3:03:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[3:03:32] &gt;&gt; And give me time. Then we will get to
[3:03:34] the rich young ruler
[3:03:36] &gt;&gt; and the season.
[3:03:39] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[3:03:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:03:40] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[3:03:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. Are we together?
[3:03:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:03:44] &gt;&gt; If everything goes easy, easy, easy,
[3:03:47] easy,
[3:03:49] &gt;&gt; eating, drinking,
[3:03:52] [laughter]
[3:03:54] &gt;&gt; before you know it, you will not know
[3:03:56] what to do.
[3:03:57] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[3:03:57] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[3:03:59] &gt;&gt; But let something hit you and you see
[3:04:01] how you pray.
[3:04:03] &gt;&gt; You will pray like you never pray.
[3:04:05] &gt;&gt; Where is that prayer coming from?
[3:04:07] &gt;&gt; Where was that prayer all the time?
[3:04:10] &gt;&gt; Because you pushed to desperation. And
[3:04:12] when you push to desperation, the best
[3:04:14] of you come up.
[3:04:15] &gt;&gt; And when they get the best of you come
[3:04:17] up, you begin to outperform everything
[3:04:20] you and you will realize that you
[3:04:22] multitasker
[3:04:23] &gt;&gt; and you thought you were not
[3:04:24] multitasking because there is no
[3:04:27] pressure that is put upon you. The
[3:04:29] energy is going far left. You wasting
[3:04:31] energy. There is nobody to channel your
[3:04:34] energy. You wasting time. You wasting
[3:04:36] energy and everything.
[3:04:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:04:41] Are we together? Because there is no
[3:04:43] structure.
[3:04:45] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[3:04:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:04:49] &gt;&gt; I had a question yesterday with the
[3:04:51] young man. They say, "What about
[3:04:52] somebody who's a senior
[3:04:54] &gt;&gt; in college?" I said, "The one who's in a
[3:04:56] senior already should be thinking about
[3:04:58] working."
[3:05:00] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[3:05:02] &gt;&gt; That's exactly.
[3:05:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:05:04] &gt;&gt; The one who's a senior is already his
[3:05:06] mind is not in senior.
[3:05:08] &gt;&gt; His mind already left the college.
[3:05:10] Your mind cannot be in college again.
[3:05:12] You a senior. In other words, they're
[3:05:13] going to kick you out sooner. You're not
[3:05:15] even in college. You already in the
[3:05:16] workforce.
[3:05:18] &gt;&gt; And not only are you in the workforce,
[3:05:20] you already looking at going out to
[3:05:21] leaving your parent.
[3:05:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:05:26] &gt;&gt; You didn't get me well. LEAVING YOUR
[3:05:28] PARENT TO FIND YOUR OWN HOUSE.
[3:05:31] &gt;&gt; I DON'T WANT YOU TO GO TO an apartment.
[3:05:33] Shoot for a house.
[3:05:38] Young people, young folks,
[3:05:40] &gt;&gt; young men, young men, I DON'T WANT YOU
[3:05:42] TO SAY, "I'M LEAVING FOR AN APARTMENT."
[3:05:44] USE YOUR TIME IN YOUR FATHER HOME. SO
[3:05:47] WHEN YOU LEAVE, JUMP INTO A CONDOMINION
[3:05:50] OR OR A HOUSE,
[3:05:52] &gt;&gt; SOMETHING YOU OWN YOURSELF, NOT GIVE
[3:05:55] MONEY TO SOMEBODY.
[3:05:58] &gt;&gt; IF YOU BEGIN TO BRING THOSE PRESSURE ON
[3:06:00] YOURSELF, YOUR ENERGY IS DIFFERENT. YOU
[3:06:04] SAY WHEN I GRADUATED FROM NOW TODAY,
[3:06:07] FROM 2 YEARS FROM NOW, I NEED TO GET
[3:06:09] MARRIED.
[3:06:14] &gt;&gt; I don't know if you get me young man.
[3:06:16] &gt;&gt; I DON'T KNOW IF YOU GET ME YOUNG MAN.
[3:06:17] YOU DON'T SIT DOWN. YOU SAY, "NO, NO,
[3:06:19] WHEN I GRADUATED, THEN I'M going to find
[3:06:20] a job. Then after I find a job, then I
[3:06:22] need to save money." No, there is no
[3:06:24] pressure.
[3:06:25] &gt;&gt; When I graduate, I have two years from
[3:06:28] now. When I'm going to graduate it, I
[3:06:30] need to make sure I save money and I
[3:06:32] need to start quoting a lady. I've been
[3:06:34] praying. I know her who she is. If
[3:06:37] everything work, if everything work, if
[3:06:40] everything work from today TO 7 MONTHS,
[3:06:44] I NEED TO MAKE SURE EVERYBODY KNOWS AND
[3:06:47] THE NEXT YEAR I NEED TO GET MARRIED.
[3:06:49] &gt;&gt; SO IN YOUR MIND, YOU ALREADY WIRED.
[3:06:53] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[3:06:54] &gt;&gt; SO WHEN THE YOUNG PEOPLE ARE TALKING,
[3:06:56] YOU DON'T TALK TO THE YOUNG PEOPLE. YOU
[3:06:58] ARE TALKING TO SISTER PAM.
[3:07:00] &gt;&gt; YOU SAY, "SISTER PAM, HOW MUCH IT IS TO
[3:07:02] DECORATE?" BECAUSE YOUR MAN IS ALREADY
[3:07:05] THERE. AND SISTER PAM SAY IT'S GOING TO
[3:07:07] COST THIS. SISTER RO, HOW ABOUT THE
[3:07:10] FOOD? YOU BEGIN TO WORK IN A SEASON FOR
[3:07:14] ANOTHER SEASON. YOUR MIND IS ALREADY
[3:07:16] [screaming] THERE. [cheering] AND THIS
[3:07:18] IS HOW YOU OPERATE.
[3:07:22] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[3:07:23] &gt;&gt; I HOPE WE ARE TOGETHER.
[3:07:25] &gt;&gt; WELCOME TO CHARLOTTE, NORTH CAROLINA.

[3:07:32] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER?
[3:07:33] &gt;&gt; THIS IS HOW YOU OPERATE.
[3:07:35] &gt;&gt; SO WHEN YOU ARE TALKING, YOUR MIND IS
[3:07:38] ALREADY WIRED UP.
[3:07:42] &gt;&gt; If they call you, they say there is a
[3:07:44] meeting over there. You will say,
[3:07:46] &gt;&gt; "What is meeting?" Young people meeting.
[3:07:49] &gt;&gt; I'm already grown up. I'm listening. I
[3:07:51] have the Holy Ghost. This is time to put
[3:07:53] everything together. Give me the link.
[3:07:58] &gt;&gt; What about that meeting? No. No. You
[3:07:59] need to get a fly. You need to book the
[3:08:00] hotel. That's expensive.
[3:08:04] &gt;&gt; Send me the tape.
[3:08:06] &gt;&gt; I have A VISION.
[3:08:08] &gt;&gt; MY MY FACE IS TOWARD JERUSALEM.
[3:08:12] &gt;&gt; MY FACE IS TOWARD JERUSALEM.
[3:08:14] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? I AM HEADING TOWARD
[3:08:17] JERUSALEM. I DON'T HAVE NO GAME. AMEN.
[3:08:21] &gt;&gt; AMEN.

[3:08:27] &gt;&gt; WE ARE ALL COMING TO THIS CHURCH. WE GO
[3:08:29] HOME. WE GO BACK TO CHURCH. YOU GO. Look
[3:08:30] what is outside.
[3:08:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:08:32] &gt;&gt; Look what is over there.
[3:08:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:08:37] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[3:08:38] &gt;&gt; You think my m is in the pouring.
[3:08:41] &gt;&gt; My mind is no longer in the poor is a
[3:08:43] history.
[3:08:43] &gt;&gt; That's right. My mind is in is in is is
[3:08:46] in the direction of the building and
[3:08:47] stuff and electrical work. I'm not even
[3:08:50] there. I'm already far away. I'm already
[3:08:51] moving it on.
[3:08:53] &gt;&gt; That job is catching me behind.
[3:08:58] &gt;&gt; I hope we together young people. So when
[3:09:00] you are with your father under the
[3:09:02] season of a father under the season you
[3:09:04] don't pay bills

[3:09:35] &gt;&gt; GLORY to God.
[3:09:36] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER?
[3:09:38] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THE BIBLE SAY LACK OF VISION.
[3:09:41] &gt;&gt; MY PEOPLE DO WHAT?
[3:09:43] &gt;&gt; IF YOU LOOK AT THE correct translation,
[3:09:46] the word perish means lack of restraint.
[3:09:49] [cheering]
[3:09:50] &gt;&gt; My people lack of vision. It's lack of
[3:09:53] restraint. In other words, YOU DON'T
[3:09:54] HAVE SOMETHING TO keep you on the
[3:09:56] highway.
[3:09:58] &gt;&gt; When they put a sign, McDonald, you out
[3:10:00] exit. WHEN THEY PUT A SIGN, CHICK-FIL-A,
[3:10:02] YOU EXIT. BUT THE ONE WHO IS WIRED,

[3:10:13] ETA, ESTIMATED TIME OF ARRIVAL. I MUST

[3:10:20] BY THE GRACE OF GOD.
[3:10:25] [applause]
[3:10:28] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER?
[3:10:30] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER?
[3:10:31] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER?
[3:10:33] &gt;&gt; LET'S STOP HERE. LET'S STAND, MY FRIEND.
[3:10:35] I was taking you to your terminal.
[3:10:38] So stay put. And then uh uh they will
[3:10:42] come and open the airplane so you can
[3:10:44] begin to to go get your luggage over
[3:10:46] there.

[3:10:57] glory to God. Amen.
[3:10:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:11:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:11:01] &gt;&gt; If you flank this church
[3:11:03] &gt;&gt; or you flank you invisible audience,
[3:11:05] it's your own fault.
[3:11:09] Mr. Brown.
[3:11:12] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[3:11:13] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[3:11:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:11:15] &gt;&gt; When prosperity comes.
[3:11:17] &gt;&gt; When money is coming,
[3:11:19] &gt;&gt; when favor of God is coming,
[3:11:21] &gt;&gt; be careful.
[3:11:22] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[3:11:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. Refocus. He structure everything.
[3:11:26] Solomon put the people. He saw the
[3:11:28] people. He say if you leave these people
[3:11:30] too easy, too easy, too easy, too easy.
[3:11:33] Before you know it, we get a chaos.
[3:11:36] &gt;&gt; God gave so much. So we need to
[3:11:38] structure everything.
[3:11:39] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[3:11:40] &gt;&gt; And as soon as Solomon is gone, the
[3:11:42] first thing take the burden off.
[3:11:44] &gt;&gt; You were not even forced labor.
[3:11:47] &gt;&gt; And when they took the burden off, when
[3:11:49] Jeroboam took the kingdom, what
[3:11:50] happened?
[3:11:52] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said the worst king
[3:11:54] ever
[3:11:55] &gt;&gt; in Israel. He bought idolatry
[3:11:58] &gt;&gt; in Israel and cause even two tribe
[3:12:01] &gt;&gt; to be removed from the book of life.
[3:12:03] It's written in your Bible.
[3:12:05] &gt;&gt; Because they didn't they remove the
[3:12:07] restraint.
[3:12:10] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[3:12:12] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[3:12:14] &gt;&gt; It's your portion to eat. It's your
[3:12:16] portion to drink. It's your portion to
[3:12:19] make merry.
[3:12:20] &gt;&gt; But look on the oncoming.
[3:12:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:12:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:12:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:12:26] &gt;&gt; Because we need to prepare even our life
[3:12:28] here. We are preparing for the season of
[3:12:31] the eternal.
[3:12:32] the season of the immortal.
[3:12:34] &gt;&gt; But you pray so we will get on to how do
[3:12:37] you get your money to heaven. We need to
[3:12:40] find that warehouse. We need to find
[3:12:43] that FedEx how to send things to heaven.
[3:12:46] It is there. Let's pray. Heavenly
[3:12:48] Father, Lord, we approaching you humbly

[3:13:01] I can go with the ability you have given
[3:13:04] us. Lord, we are committing everything
[3:13:06] that was spoken into your hand. May you,
[3:13:09] the Holy Spirit, the inside teacher, may
[3:13:12] you take a hold of these young people.
[3:13:14] Take hold of spoken word. Take hold of
[3:13:17] each one of us. Father, refocus our life
[3:13:20] again. Bring us Lord where we can be
[3:13:23] more productive for your kingdom until
[3:13:26] things that we hear, things that we
[3:13:28] heard, the message that we are cherished
[3:13:31] become a true life affecting every
[3:13:34] aspect of our life. Lord, protect us
[3:13:37] through the oncoming week. Remove any
[3:13:39] attack from the world of darkness.
[3:13:41] Father, we thank you and commit
[3:13:43] everything unto the hand. Touch the sick
[3:13:45] and the afflicted, Lord, in the name of
[3:13:48] Jesus Christ. [music] Amen.
