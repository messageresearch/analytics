what he told you right just obey his word this is not brother stephen this is the bible says brother brother i'm saying the bible says what brother i'm saying so you have nothing to do with me keep obeying his word you're going to see this is just the beginning of it it's going to stop and before you know it if you come to this church we've seen you're going to learn the hard way genesis 18 verse 21. everybody there this is god talking to abraham i will go down now and see whether they have done altogether according to the cry of it which is come to me and if not i would know god heard the cry that the people of sodom and gomorrah and the cities around were wicked so god came down to destroy everything so everything was already doomed everybody clear and the man turned their faces from there and went to sodom but abraham stood yet before the lord that's the head of the house and sarah called him my lord you remember my lord on wednesday now you understand what it means my ruler ownership amen and abraham junior you might be seated and say will you destroy the righteous with the water now in the city of sodom somebody was there that is related to abraham do you know his name lord was lord abraham's son lord was who so abraham was a legal guardian [Laughter] everybody clear abraham was a legal guardian to lord amen when lord got in trouble they came to inform abraham what did he do he armed the people went there and fight against five kings because of responsibility and he rescued lot out of it and pulled him back again now they separated with lord and lord went to sodom and god came and said shall i hide anything to abraham who's going to be heir i'm going to disclose the whole plan to abraham when abraham saw the plan being disclosed abraham looked he said oh my god so every city around sodom including sodom and gomorrah are going to be destroyed so in the economy of god there was no mercy for sodom there was no mercy for gomorrah there was no mercy for the surrounding cities and lot was inside that city a lot is it clicking sister watch the power of god everybody clear and abraham jr and say will you destroy the righteous with the water how many ratchets were in sodom somebody get the answer do you know where he got it how many righteous praise the lord one what was his name you go to the book of peter peter say the soul of the just lot the righteous was vexed with the city of sodom so the entire city had only one person because the angel pulled his family but still they were not under the economy hallelujah i told you to stay awake right i knew amen and abraham jr were near and say will you also destroy lot did you get now are you reading your scripture did you also destroy the righteous lot and the wicked with the wicked verse 24 pay raps there be how many god closed the door of mercy to sodom do you follow me abraham being the legal guardian of lord came to god and begin to reopen the door of mercy do you follow me god closed the door he said everything is doomed abraham came as a responsible and begin to reopen the door if they can squeeze lot out hallelujah the sister gathered perhaps there be 50 righteous inside the city god block everything abraham reopened 50 50 chairs who are you abraham to open mercy when god have closed and he opened a door for 50 people this is raw meat perhaps there be 50 righteous inside the city will you also destroy and not spare the place for 50 riches that that are there in that be far from you to do after this manner to slay the righteous with the wicked abraham is pleading with god and that the righteous should be as the weakened that be far from you you shall not judge you you you shall not get from you shall not the judge of all the earth do right god is talking to abraham abraham is talking to god he say now listen you the judge of the heaven and earth and you are not just a judge but you are a righteous judge and a righteous judge must do things that are right right and god said yes he said but now if you are just how can you let the wicked perish with the righteousness so can you spare 50 it looks like abraham is more righteous than god amen verse 26 and the lord say if i found in sodom how many in other words i agree abraham i already closed the door now you push too hard i have to reopen for 50. what power has abraham to open the doors of mercy when gloves already closed [Music] stay under malachi 4. hallelujah and the lord say if i found in sodom 50 because that's where slot was righteous inside the city then i will spare all the place for the water not only am i going to spare 50 but abraham your heart pushed so hard that i can even spare the city that i have already condemned what power have abraham what power hallelujah verse 27 and abraham answer and say behold now i have taken upon me to speak to the lord which i am but dustin ashes he goes back to humility you know i'm nothing i'm nothing i'm nothing you know that right you're the big man you're the boss you're the mighty conqueror you're the way you make it you're the miracle workers he knows how to play with his god and god begin to say abraham abraham again abraham amen because god inhabits the presence of his people [Applause] hallelujah humble the self before god and it's going to open a different door hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord perhaps there verse 28 shall like how many abraham knew that with everything i found there um not 50. so he opened 50. he's going to count he won't find 50 he's going to destroy let me nail him down a little bit so before i nail him down let me give him some food because before jacob gets blessed he must prepare food for isaac when isaac eat and he's happy then he stop blessing hallelujah he said abraham answer and say behold now i have taken upon the lord upon me to speak to the lord 27 which i am but dustin ashes perhaps they shall lack how many what what divided by what ten percent five five hallelujah five or 50 of the 50 righteous will you destroy all the city for lack of five and he said if i find there 45 i will not do water in other words he removed five from 50 the remaining was water god said okay check abraham who are you you are manipulating god verse 29 and he spoke to him yet again and said perhaps they shall be fully found now he takes how many five again 40. he's getting he's working with what he pushed the first grace and sodom could not stand there he pushed the second grace and sodom still can't get there these are bullets that are loaded abraham knew those bullets and when he needed it he began to load them hallelujah and he said i will not do it for 46 and he said to him oh let not the lord be angry because he know he's pushing hard let not the lord be angry and i will speak perhaps desha 30 be found what he said if i keep going five five he's going to run out let me jump quickly 10. everybody here two how many hallelujah he said and 35 days 10 is a bad number which is a number of what carnality let me remove carnality out of that city the opening of the seventh seal the bible became anew i will not do it if i found how many 30 days and he said behold now i have taken upon me to speak to the lord perhaps there shall be how many let me go down quickly minus 10 20. abraham fine and he said i would not destroy it for how many 26 and he said oh let not the lord be angry i will speak yet but this once pair ups how many he took 10 the first time he took 10 the second time he took 10 the third time he reached perfection can't take it out anymore and he said oh let them let not the lord be angry i will speak yet but this was perhaps 10 shall be founded and he said i would not destroy it for how many and the lord went his way that was it first second third fourth how many who are you abraham to push grace five times god close the door abraham push god say okay i agree he push again abraham i agree he pushes again abraham you know you know you know he pushes again he pushed it five times then abraham leaving you ready let's go to chapter 19 verse 13. just bear with me for we would now this is lot with the angel for we will destroy this place because the cry of them is what's great before the face of the lord and the lord has sent us to do what to destroy the place and lord went out and spoke to his son-in-law remember the number is what 10 window and spoke to his sons-in-law which married his daughter and say up get you out of this place for the lord will destroy this city but he seemed as one that mocked to his son-in-law in other words they thought he was joking and when the morning arose then the angel has stand hastened lot when abraham was talking to the angel of the lord the two angels already went down to sodom do you follow me when abraham was discussing debating with god when he reached temmie there were 10 god send a text message to the angel and he told the two engine the number is 10 but make sure he's more worrying about lot and the engine cut the message they say god when they enter in sodom they're going straight to lot do you have 10 people the message is beautiful hallelujah and one day that's why lord went and pleaded he said hey my son-in-law come 10 people 10 people the boat is open 10 people me my wife my two daughters i still have a place for six if we can reach 10 god stop the wrath hallelujah and when the morning arose then the angel huston lord saying arise take your wife in other words there is no 10 people the city must be destroyed but because of abraham you come on here you come on come on come on quickly i'm still waiting they grabbed him hallelujah and saying eras take your wife and your two daughters which are here lest you be consumed in the iniquity of the city and while he do what a lot lingering instead of coming out daddy's crying come out it's incapable already in that church come out did somebody call it it's incapable of already in that church come out why the mercies of abraham has opened the door come out the angels say now we're going to go by force take him by force the mercies of abraham have a power to even grab you by force and to

hand of his wife and upon the hand of his two daughter the lord being walter to whom why why the lord being merciful to him and they brought him forth and set him outside the city go out we're gonna destroy it watch again and he came to pass when they had brought them forth abroad that he said escape for your life look not behind you neither stay you in all the planes escaped water the engine gave him the place say go to the mountain specifically lest you be consumed watch again and lord said to them oh not so my lord at the beginning he said my lords plural now he's saying my lord one they have faith of abraham because abraham was the one that saved my lord that faith already that anointing job when he dropped look at him behaving like abraham verse 19 behold now your servant has found water who was using grace first when he said my lord the anointing came with the correct revelation grace opened the door oh my god behold now your servant has found grace in your son and you have magnified your water which you have showed to me in saving my life and i cannot escape to the water let some evil take me and i die behold now this city is water he begin to point the angel there is too far can i go to this city which city was it this city is near to flee and it's a little one oh let me escape there is he not a little one and my soul shall live it's a small city can i just go to that small one he begin to intercede for a city watch verse 21 and he said to him that lord said to him see i have done water which power have lot to push mercy and to open a door for a city let's see what kind of city and i have accepted you concerning this thing also that i will not overthrow this city for the which you have worked in other words that city was in our agenda to be destroyed

you say to your people which you have brought out forth of the land of egypt god said you brought them out that's why he said moses is different because i talked to him face to face amen with great power and a mighty hand twelve wherefore should the egyptian speak and save for mischief did he bring at them out to slay them in the mountains and consume them from the face of the earth turn from your fierce anger and do what who's telling god to repent in other words god is angry moses come and say why are you acting like this if you kill them all the people of egypt will say you see he was irresponsible that's why he brought them to kill them repent now god is watching moses what you say repent what power has moses to stop the wrath of god [Applause] my god he said repent of this evil against your people remember abraham isaac god don't imagine moses is telling god sit down sit down god sat down he said you remember abraham you remember the promise that you gave him you remember isaac why are you acting like this and god is there these people too much hallelujah remember abraham as they can and israel your servant if you look there he didn't call jacob because jacob is a bad name he loaded israel you the one that gave him the name right remember israel your servant to whom you saw by your own self and say to them i will multiply your seed as the star of heaven and all this land that i have spoken of earth will i give to your seed and they shall be narrated for what verse 14 and the lord did water oh moses you are right [Laughter] and the lord repented of the evil which he thought to do to his water are you following me job to verse 31 who's pleading what power does he have to take god and turn him around and god say yes i changed my mind i repented amen verse 31 and moses returned to the lord and say oh these people have seen a great sin and have made them gods of gold yet now if you will the water forgive their sin if and if what moses is threatening god he said now your anger is calm down let's talk over this thing i know that they did something that is bad it's a very very very bad thing but what i'm asking you you need to forgive them god is sitting keep on moses if you don't forgive them am i reading a different bubble let's go back again verse 31. verse 32 yet now if you will forgive the sin and if not plot me i pray you out of your book which you have written in other words i'm telling you you need to forgive them you chose me you wanted to destroy everybody to keep me so i understand your language that i am special to you so let me put myself as a sacrifice you kill me if you don't want to forgive israel what power have moses what power have they had profit to open the door of mercy when god already closed it take second samuel then we're going to pray oh my god second samuel 28 you there hallelujah ii samuel 28 24 i'm sorry if you dare you can say amen it seems like david have a hard-headed was a hard-headed man verse one and again the anger of the lord was kindled against israel and he moved david against them if you look on the chronicle he was the devil who did that amen against them to say god number israel and judah there is something tough about david that when they tell him not to do something he always does it when he was the wife of uh he asked the question whose wife is that when they told him it is the wife of you i still he went and did and here he want to go ahead and number the people and they're going to warn him amen for the king said to joab the captain of the host which was with him everybody go now through all the tribe of israel from then even to bathsheba and number you the people that are may know the number of the people and jobs said to the king now the lord your god add to the people how many how many so ever there be a hundred fold and that the eyes of my lord the king may see but why does my lord the king delight in this thing god brought so many people in israel god increase your church why do you want to do something that is bad david verse 4 notwithstanding nevertheless the king's word prevail against job now that i say that you go gonna do it and against the captain of the host and job and the captain of the host went out from the presence of the king to number the people of water jump to verse 10. you there and david hart smote him after that he had numbered the what this is what happened when they tell you not to do something stop your relationship with that boy you don't listen stop your relationship with that girl you don't listen after you committed fornication then something condemned you you didn't listen at the first place condemnation comes and david's heart smote him after not before he had numbered the people he already seen and david said to the lord i have sinned greatly and in that i have done and now i beseech you oh lord take away the iniquity of your servant iniquity because he knew better for i have done very foolishly and when for when david was up in the morning the word of the lord came to the prophet god david seal the prophet of the hour saying go and say to david just say the lord i offer you how many things three things choose you one of them that i may do it to you so god came to david and told him and said to him shall seven years of famine come to you in your land that's the first option number three or will you flee three months before your enemies while they pursue you that's number two oh that there be three days pestilence in your land now advice in other words consider choose and see what answer i shall return to him that sent me in other words i'm coming with a whooping you only have three options was an option there to forgive david no option mercy is gone you follow me no option mercy is gone one two three you choose one and then i go tell him i'm just a spokesman amen verse 14 and david said to god i am in a great strait distress let us fall did he say let me he said let who who was us let us me and israel why did he include israel why let us fall now into the hand of the water he didn't touch any of the option did you see that he didn't touch any of the options because mercy was over then david pushed a different door he opened his emergency kit did you follow me did you follow me then he looked an emergency kit he found a bullet that bullet abraham used it five times the bullet not to use it the bullet moses use it and david pulled that emergency bullet and loaded say take me put me into his hand let me see how he's going to kill me because he told me i am the lord after i am a man after his own heart put me in his hand let him slay me because job said don't he slay me yet i do whatever put me in his hand and i'm gonna see how he's gonna handle me because he's closing all the mercy's dog i know what to do bring my emergency case put me in his hand david was a prophet and god was a prophet he was a minor prophet this one was a major prophet and he was the king which means he was the head of israel that's why he said put us the head is pulling a bullet when mercy is closed hallelujah are you there straight let us fall now in the hand of god why for his what for his mercies are great let me not fall in the hand of what there is no mercy man they're going to kill me they were looking for me all this time you give it to me they're going to kill me put me to somebody let me see how he's going to handle me everybody there so the lord sent a pestilence upon israel from the morning even to the time appointed and they died of the people from them even to boshiba 70 000 men and when the angel of the lord stretched out his hand upon water where was david's living when the angel of the lord changed direction to approach where david is to destroy it the lord did what can you read it with me the lord did what who told him to repent there was a bullet emergency bullet that that the head usually have yes brother kelly when they load the bullet relax you there and the angel stretched his hand upon jerusalem to destroy it and the lord repented oh my god of him of the evil and say to the angel that destroyed the people it is water god himself choose the plug david didn't choose god choose the plague and the plague was supposed to be for how many days three days when it started god blocked he said who was in jerusalem that was telling god go ahead shoot me go shoot me god say hey take the weapon off hallelujah it is enough stay now your hand and the angel of the lord was by the trashing place of arona the jebusite brother kelly and david spoke to the lord when he saw the angel that smote the people and say lord i me david have sinned and i me david i have done wickedly by this what you see how david called israel not these people because david was a shepherd this sheep whatever though in other words i am the one who sinned why are you destroying the innocent sleeping wake up amen let your hand i pray you be a guest against who come and slay me that's what i told you take care of me slay me and against my water and god came the same prophet came as an emergency go see david quickly came that day to david said to him go up here an altar to the lord in the trenching full of water there is a mystery to that place it's going to open the place for the temple why did he reveal that and he was not angry on david verse 25 and david built there an altar to the lord an burnt offering and peace offering so the lord wasn't treated for the land and the plague was water god told david i can't kill you i'm going to give you a secret for you to stop this go to the place of arunade there is a spiritual message mystery day go there offer a day when you offer there it is automatically guaranteed you're going to be accepted when you are accepted i'm going to lock the car the plug what power has david to open the door when mercy is closed let's pray heavenly father lord we thank you for your grace for your love your mercy and for everything you are doing for us thank you for your presence and your blessings this morning father i have done what a man can do if you give him grace now may you come and take over and bless your people may the devil be completely sealed out may you touch those that are sick touch sister d father lose her from the power of the devil touch those that are sleepy this morning lord how do we i i will build this demonic spirit away from this place everyone that is sick touch and heal him lord and father bless your children in the name of jesus christ amen god bless you you ready let's go we on par 2035 on wednesday we were dealing with the head we found out that as the head the head is a position that was given by god and that position was given as a position of power a position of authority but not a power to abuse but that power goes with responsibility how many listen to the sermon on wednesday blessed be the name of the lord and we found out that that responsibility was given to the head and the head was the man as a man as a responsible you must take care of the food of your house you must take care of the clothing of your wife you must take care of the shelter of your wife you must take care of the marital duty that paul said do benevolence to your wife in other words you must take care of her passion you must also take care of the work because in eden the responsibility to work was given to men not to the woman the woman the responsibility was given for motherhood to take care of the children and to build her own home everybody clear so far now with this headship there is something that was hidden there i believe you already called it you ready now let's go in john chapter 6 37 the bible says all that the father giveth me shall do work so by this statement if the father has already predestined you there is no way you're going to miss heaven you follow me all that the father has given me shall come and him that comes to me i will in no wise cast out he's going to come because the father already gave it to him anybody clear so far verse 13 for i came down from heaven not to do my own will but the will of him that sent him what is the will of him that sent jesus what is the will of the father and this is the father's will which has sent me that of all brother branham say all means the children of god oh which he has given me i should lose water but should raise it up again at the last day and this is the will of him that sent me that everyone which sees the son and belief on him may have everlasting life and i will raise him and i will raise him up at the last workout in other words when we come in this world there is a certain number of people that god gave to the lord and no matter what's going to happen do you follow me god will never lose one of them everybody understand me second timothy chapter 2 verse 19. nevertheless the foundation of god the pillar standard sure why is he sure having this seal the lord knows them that are water so every child of god no matter where you are no matter where you were born no matter which nation you are god knows exactly where you are and if you're a child of god god will never lose you do you follow me but the children of god sometimes get in the place where they are almost lost you follow me the children of god found themselves sometime in situations where there is no way out the children of god find themselves sometimes when they are cornered with pharaoh behind the red sea before the wilderness over there and it looks like our hope is finished way maker hallelujah hallelujah brother brother i'm on the incoming storm he say i say no the thing surprises me is right the thing surprises me means water why brother branham the grace of god surprises you why hallelujah i have said i have exhausted his mercy many times but i never can exhaust his water and i am so glad of that mother's day message the children of god sometimes found themselves in situations that we made mistake we made final mistake we made bad judgment the devil corner you all the way into a place like there is no way out in the places where all mercy is gone when mercy is gone there is always a special grace that god opened if you are his child is everybody awake check whoever is sleeping outside are you there are you there when we talk about the nazarite vow we found out that there are many heads the messenger is the head to the agent the pastor is ahead to the church the husband is the head to the wife the father is ahead to his home and the younger sister and the legal guardian is ahead to the one that lost his father and for the divorce and the widow the head is crushed everybody follow me now the bible says in number 30 brother kelly he talked to me this he didn't know what he opened if a woman also vowed vow unto the lord and bound herself by a bomb being in her water who's the head father hallelujah but in her father's house in her youth but if her father disallow her in other words her father canceled the vow in the day that he hears not any of her vow all of her bones where if she has burned her soul justin when a woman vowed for to the lord she automatically bound herself she can't get loose do you follow me and sometimes under pressure under nervousness under too much distress under too much problem under too much condition and situation that happen in our life we say things that are not correct we opt for certain we decide on certain things that get us bound we make the wrong decision and that decision costs us hallelujah not any of her vow or her bonds that vow it's binding it's a bond wherewith she shall burn her soul shall stand and the lord shall want him because her father did want him so even though a young system can find herself connor and there is no way out you follow me the head of the house have a special bullet in his emergency case [Applause] [Music] do you follow me please give me time let me unload this because the lord keep bringing this back over and over do you follow me when a young sister find herself bound she made a bad decision and the lord is supposed to come and deal with her the head of the house have the right to open the emergency case do you follow me that emergency case has a bullet amen that can break the vow and if the head break the vow god comes and say i accept it verse six and if she had a dollar what the head husband anybody there when she vowed or she added out of her lips where if she did what she burned her soul but if her husband disallow her on the day that he heard it then he shall make her vow which she vowed and that which she added with her lips wherewith she burned her soul of water and the lord shall do what the forgiveness that pardon lays with the head it is a power that every head have before god when the woman in tennessee lost her husband her head became crushed and when her son begin to die she went back to god and she said i am a widow i read in your bible that there was a widow insurrector and you send elijah the prophet where is my elijah where is my head off the edge god look he said where is william ryan branham they say he's driving on the airplane over there he's going to a meeting can't sell that meeting there is an emergency bullet here bring this plant down hallelujah bring that plane down learn their pen tell him as my head of the age as my representative of the age go over them and give that woman hope when all hope was gone hallelujah do you follow me hallelujah this head has a special grace hallelujah that grace carry a special pardon that's why you're going to be surprised in heaven this grace is the grace that surprised you in heaven it is the grace that open door to people you thought could not be saved [Music] [Applause] the people you taught all hope is gone everything is finished this grace will surprise you it is usually in the emergency case hallelujah even if a cabbage is written if the head recognizes disgrace he can load the bullet and shoot god will force that door open and say who are you looking for my daughter come out come out come out quick she come out they cross the door hallelujah oh my god blessed be the name of the lord this special grace this special pardon lays in the mystery of abraham lincoln the mystery of abraham lincoln you thought b william branham was telling you stories abraham lincoln what's going on some years ago in the civil war oh the revolutionary one oh my hallelujah i believe it was the time of abraham lincoln that there was a soldier that had done a violence and he had run away in time of battle shook his line of duty and they carried the man and they tried him before the courts which court was it and found him what and the sentence was to be dull to be what death and there was a man who had touched so much of this young fellow he was nervous an upset boy and when the old musket and cannon begin to fire he just ran because he was scared to death but he had shirk his duty and he was going to be killed what pushed this boy to make this decision was he was scared and he got under pressure he didn't mean bad but he got trapped by the devil yet lord said kill him hallelujah in a certain day his execution was set and a friend of his went to the president of united states they want them they want them [Applause] mercies over mercy's over grace take over abraham lincoln and good old abby as he was entering into the hotel room this friend run to him and he said mr lincoln and he said i know you to be a water abraham is pleading i know you're a good judge you're the judge of heaven and earth consider this i know you'll be a christian man you are the word praises not abraham lincoln no abraham lincoln i know you are a christian oh i like that not only are you a christian but the chief commander oh keep going hallelujah the chief commander of the army the chief commander of the water not the country because the boy was a military man i am pulling abraham lincoln to the army because the army condemned him hallelujah and this certain man is guilty of what they have tried him for but his condition he was scared he's a good man and i know you don't believe in taking a man's life abraham is pleading with god and his name is abraham lincoln who can put a message like that that line up with the bible hallelujah with your word on a piece of what this grace comes in a very simple form it's a grace that usually hides in simplicity his life will be spared even if he has to stay in the federal prison don't let him be killed put him in prison but don't kill him he was a good boy i know him raise up in the neighborhood with him hallelujah abraham lincoln good honor be got him a piece of paper and wrote just a couple of words across there pardon this man abraham lincoln oh that boy rushed back to the prison cell and he showed his friend he said you are freely pardoned he said don't make fun of me knowing i'm going to i'm to die in the morning he said here is the welcome the president of united states the chief the commander and chief he signed your work and the boy look at it and say this is just a piece of paper there is nothing to it you are trying to make my death more miserable than it than it ever was intended for it to be if i will not receive it and he walked back behind the cell and refused to look at the paper anymore because he said are you awake if mr lincoln would sign my pardon he would have had the water and so forth and he's still upon it and so forth i must see a letter that say president of united states from the white house with the seal with everything then i will accept the man missed that digress that comes from the supreme head usually comes in simplicity so therefore i will not receive it because it's only a mockery the next morning the men died before the firing squad now what is going to happen there is a commander and chief of the army say that this man was pardoned and now he's shortified firing squad now what are we going to do he was tried in the federal court of our nation and here was the verdict of the water all the water is said uh is not hell unless it's received as a what this grace brings a pardon it is a grace that stays with the head it comes in simplicity hallelujah when adam saw his wife eve that is committed adultery and if sin because in first corinthians chapter 2 the bible says that it was the woman that sin it was the woman that brought the transgression not the man when adam saw that adam looked he said you know what when elohim is coming he's going to be angry when he comes if he sees if he's going to go ahead and destroy it and that was it and he can bring me another wife you follow me but when god created adam and eve there was not another wife in adam the creation of adam was one male and one female there were not many females do you follow me it was not so in the beginning you follow me so adam could not afford to lose his only wife do you follow me i'm starting from genesis now are you there adam opened the emergency kit and he grabbed the bullet and he lost the bullet he said eve let me sin i'm going to sin with you adam knew the truth but adam took his own righteousness and put it down because his purpose was when he comes he's gonna call adam adam adam did his gps work like that matter of fact you don't even have a name so let me present myself before him let him kill me do you follow adam took his seed he took his spam and put it into it and said if you kill it you are killing my child over there do you follow me now the seed of adam begin to even bring protection to came [Applause] the protection of flood was extending to the city of sodom the protection of abel was protecting cain when god came down he said adam where are you what did you do he looked at eve he see evil where are they if i destroy it it's a problem i'm going to destroy the wife of edgar abram adam and i'm going to also destroy the seed of heaven i must wait till she delivers then i will handle the serpent seed later on adam as the head of heath use that bullet to block god [Music] is everybody okay when god came in genesis 18 and came to visit abraham do you follow me god said that abraham why did sarah your wife lied [Applause] do you follow me sarah came and lie in the face of god sarah said ah i didn't lie in the face of god when the anger of the lord kingdom abraham came up hallelujah the first one is done we're on the second one circumcision could only be in the mail but if the woman was married to a male she was part of him she was circumcised with him the male circumcised the woman that's why you need to stay virgin you remember in timothy where he said in their notwithstanding she shall be saved in childbearing if she continue in faith and holiness with all sobriety we already talked about it now circumcision you know sarah laughed in the tent behind her and the message or at the message of the angel when he said abraham not knowing who he was a stranger where is the wife sarah how did he know that he had a wife in birth fame he said why did sarah live concerning this baby and sarah come forth and say she did it and say but you did and he would have killed her right there if she was not a part of what so what so would god slay us if we was not part of what the mercy of christ holds us together as daughters and perversion in the water it was abraham grace despair sarah that's why sarah said my lord do you follow me when israel israel was about to be killed by god you follow me we read in a scripture that god came out and said moses move out let me destroy these people moses look he said what israel did they are doomed where is my emergency kit joshua bring the emergency kit joshua run he said this is it he opened up he pulled the bullet he put it in he said go ahead and kill me before you destroy israel kill me if you want go in your book and erase my name because moses name was in the lamp's book of life and that name cannot be raised he uses the headship with grace to protect the people of israel do you follow me when israel begin to struggle god came and gave israel the law and what the law did the law put the people of israel in prison because paul says that sin took occasion by the law when they say don't steal automatically they put you in temptation then the devil comes and begin to say go ahead and steal go ahead and steal go ahead and say because now if you do it it's a sin ever clear so when the law was brought in israel their law corner the human people because grace was still not given a day yet fully yet when the law was given adultery was still working there god came and said you shall not commit adultery you shall not kill the child as god did that israel now was tempted for adultery you follow me then they came to moses they said moses what can we do i don't like this woman i don't like this woman moses look he said the law they give them there is no man that can leave this law it's a tight law you do this they kill you you do this they kill you if this is what you want joshua where is the emergency kit i'm having a problem of marriage and divorce i must free these because they are children of god god put them into the bondage of the law they can't help it because the worshiper was not purged yet that's why they were keeping the desire of sin it is not their fault god gave them the law but god did not purge their conscience as a head i need to use a grace bring me the emergency kit joshua came again moses opened he pulled the bullet he said if you don't like your wife write her a letter of divorcement and just go ahead and send her away and when jesus came he never contradicted moses are you there paul came also and found marriage and divorce trouble and the people still struggle in first corinthians chapter seven paul say but to the rest speak who who was i not who let me go back up but i paul speak this by what and not of a what who gave him permission to speak he was the messenger to the angel i not the lord if any brother has a wife that believe not and she be pleased to dwell with him let him not put her water and a christian she's not a christian i need to chase her pulse look he said what can i do here he look at the scripture no scripture he look at the scripture no scripture he look at the scripture no scripture and somebody say did you forget you the head bring me the emergency case now it is me saying not god me paul i give you permission stay with your wife amen hallelujah and the woman which has a husband that believe not and if he be pleased to dwell with her let her not do what do not divorce stay there put it on my account when you go to heaven tell god me paul gave you that decision show him my ticket when you write a check and your check bounced back by law the bank have a right to kick you off a draft but if you go to a supervisor the supervisor has a power to reverse that of a draft even though you did it he can say i forgive you go ahead reimburse the money and the banks say i agree are you there when brother branham came to his time he found people cornered they will have married their divorce they married their divorce they go out and they begin to marry other women and they might be in their second marriage or third marriage or fourth marriage but when the message came as predestinated seed of god they received the message but the message comes like a pure word of god when the message came the message told them because of your condition you cannot enter heaven and the pressure was now brought to the head they brought it in question and answer brother branham this is my condition what can i do brother branham check the scripture it is locked he checked the scripture it is locked god came in the mountain and say william branham do you understand why moses gives a letter of disbursement did you ever see me contradict moses brother i'm saying no no no no no no he said okay do you remember paul says that this is me and not the lord why did they put that in my holy bible and i never contradicted paul there is a bullet for the headship there is a special grace check your emergency kit open your kit look at the corner there branham you gonna find that bullet when brother branham had that he says now i can preach marriage and divorce brother branham said he had that revelation before he could not preach because the children of god were locked but when the revelation of that special grace that bring a special pardon for the predestinated seed of god was unfolded to brother branham he says now i can preach marriage and divorce i'm gonna preach them that truth and some of them will find themselves they are cornered they don't know what to do because they already messed up then i'm gonna pull my emergency bullet and free them under the authority of the crowd but moses was permitted and god recognized it what paul also had the right when he found his his the church of who his church in that condition now you believe this to be the truth to be true and believe it to come from god and by the vindication of his word he thundered the nazarite valley the cloud of samsung the seven headlocks that's why brother branham is pulling the power from the cloud the power of the hair and by vindication of his cloud and his message that brought me this far should not god upon the mountain permit me to do the same thing to suffer you to go on the way you are and do it what go with your wives and live in water the devil have no right to condemn you anymore tell him put it under my shoulder are you there for the hour is what the coming of the lord is what we have not got time to do that i'm looking for my predestinated state time is gone push the door off of grace open it again let them pass let them pass because god will lose none of it don't you dare to try it again now you got spare don't do it again you push me to open the door and i'll let you go be careful don't do that again amen i'm speaking only to adam the head the head the head the head hallelujah god bore me what witness of that on the mount on the mountain that i could say this a supernatural revelation because of the opening of the seventh hill and this is a question in god's word let them go on in as they are and sin what who did that in the bible jesus he was not so from the beginning that's right it was not so it would not be to the end but under modern condition as god's servant so under modern condition i command you to go to your home with your wife if you are happy with her live with her raise your children in the abnormation of god but god be merciful to you if you ever want her it is a grace that opens you a corner when you are doomed do you follow me you teach your children to never do a thing like that bring them up in the admonition of god and now that you are as you are let us go now and then it's at the late evening hour that we are living in and pressed toward the mark of his high calling in christ where all things will be water follow the third pool don't leave again under condemnation i the head receive it amen remember only for what the temp of marriage and divorce brother branham said it's a situation that are only to who which minister you come back you come back and listen you can listen to the table but the tape itself let see because it gets among the congregation and some is this way and some that way enjoy their own water brother brother say when i preach marriage and divorce that temp belonged to the minister but give it to the congregation to listen but the decision don't let the congregation take it because this one will say this way and this one will say this way they are not the head you follow me i want ministers brothers to have this in their own water and let them go from there because they are the ones that are what a minister that is responsible is a pastor don't ever discuss a subject of marriage and divorce with someone because you are not the head if you hear somebody from another church going to marriage problem and their pastor is handling the situation stay away because you don't have that grace that the pastor has do you follow me if a sister wanna talk to her pastor don't never stop her don't ever tell her you don't have to take your stuff to anybody you need to keep it to yourself because you are blocking god's channel if something ever happened to that sister you gonna be responsible for it when a brother want to talk to a pastor or to a deacon don't block them you need to understand that the head have a special grace to unlock situation that is not on your competency they are the one like to go down and play to the water the pastor will judge the situation and when he found the situation god will tell him open there get the bullet this is my child free him and you get against the pastor you don't know what you're doing amen some of this choir marriage and divorce it is more sacred than people think it is everybody clear let me see where we are oh my god let me head quickly

book of solomon if i'm not the song of solomon if i'm not mistaken yeah and they stood before moses and before end yes the priest and before the princes and all congregation by the door of the tabernacle of the congregation saying our father died in the wilderness and was not in the company of them that gather themselves together against the lord in the company of who every child in this family was a woman they have no brothers and god gave the law of an inheritance that when a father died who's gonna get the inheritance the son amen then they stood up they say wait a minute all of us are women so our father died so where is the property of our father so we're going to go in the promised land and be homeless you follow me the one to the head the head they went to moses they said moses our daddy was not a rebel when people rebelled against you and reject your message we stood with the message the people that rejected the message we did in there my father stood with the message it's a blessing to have a father who stood with the message hallelujah now we have an inheritance but we don't have a brother what are we going to do when grey when mercy is closed are you there there is always an emergency bullet for the children of god amen you there our father verse 3 died in the wilderness and he was not in the company of them that gathered themselves together against the lord in the company of korra but die in his own water and has no what he died in his own he didn't reject the message amen why should the name of who they are pleading for their head why is the name of our father be done away erase from among his family because he has no water question who determined which child need to be born it's god in other words god is the one that send us all women so now we are in a situation where we don't have a home because of what god did and now and our father and our family we believe the message so god better find the solution and the lord said no moses scratch his head he look in the lord nothing hallelujah hallelujah give to us therefore a possession among the brethren of our when you giving our uncle a possession we want our property day we need three acres and make sure it's this it's this is this that's ours moses say what kind of women is this are you there verse five and moses brought their cross before who and the lord spoke to moses saying the daughters of zelophehad speak what are you there in other words god was giving the law he said write this motion write this moses write this moses but the daughter of this man reminded god that you forgot the law god said they are right there is a law in me your husband god is a wonderful man he's a husband he's a brother he's a he's all amen the daughter of zeloped the love head speak right you shall surely give them a possession of an inheritance among their father's brethren and you shall cause the inheritance of the father to pass to who a new law is open because of somebody who push the door beyond mercy are you following me are you following me let me stop here and we're going to pick up again we're going to see david and the show brain you know that you know that story you know david even the women even the woman that was caught in adultery amen the pharisees made a mistake they didn't know that woman was predestinated they should have getting that woman and kill her and god will say fine but because she was a child of god they made a mistake and pull her to jesus christ and say here we don't have argument we have a video we video tape here we have it we're gonna show you this is her committing adultery it is finished you must agree with us okay moses okay jesus that's what we want you to do jesus look yes they say what do you say defeat yourself jesus drop down and begin to write and they say rewarding for your eyes jesus said let me teach this pharisee something he pulled his emergency kit are you there and he pulled the bullet and he loaded and he said whoever for you have not done anything god first cast the first one and he stopped one out two out three out by lord they had the right to kill him but when mercy is closed there is a grace door that can reopen to make the child of god pass are you there jesus look when the last one went he said where are your accusers that's right he said i don't see none of them i don't condemn you i know what push you to this go and do it no more when that grace was given to that woman regardless of the videotape regardless of the evidence that woman could turn back again with the law of moses and the evidence and nobody could touch her it is all over the scripture i will take lord willing on wednesday we take david we take the priest we take the leave we go all the way to paul and honesty it's all over in the scripture that's why under the third pool when they brought the two boys the boy and the girl this last one over there and they begin to disrespect brother brahman and make love in the church the power came down and said speak what you want to speak and william marion branham look he opened the emergency case he pulled the bullet he said the devil who did them that it is not them i forgive you it is a power not to destroy a power to build up when all mercy seems to be closed when you are under a tight situation when you made a bad decision you found yourself in a difficult marriage you find yourself in a difficult situation you pick a car where you are not supposed to pick a car because you were under pressure you had to sign a paperwork because you were under pressure you have to sign for this house because you were under pressure you made the wrong choice there is always a bullet [Applause] are you there are you there and that bullet came in the same time and say you are justified meaning you have never done it to begin with you are free from all condemnation because there is no condemnation to those that are in what christ you are free from your guiltiness let's stand are you there you make a mistake don't run from the church you make a mistake don't run away you make a mistake don't kill yourself you make a mistake don't commit suicide come back to god plead with him there is always a bullet that can open door when the entire world condemns you he can stand and say leave him alone let him pass brother branham say he will be a disappointment in the day of judgment he said the people that you taught that thought they were right they're gonna be surprised over there amen why i can go even to the fifth of the cross is there at the last minute jesus dying as a sinner pulled the bullet jesus says sinner pull a bullet being a sinner dying as a sinner he pulled the bullet and he turned around and shoot and the boy entered paradise when he entered peridot they say who are you with fifa abraham say a fifa year he said yes abraham look at your bosom i was there it was the circumstances of life that pushed me to start stealing but in my heart i love the lord every time i was stealing i didn't want it we were forced to kill this man it was not me my friend told me to shoot the bullet that's why i killed him and now i'm killed crosstalk he say open that grace father i'm dying almost dying there was one that i was supposed to get i need an emergency bullet god drop it he loaded he said you and me we meet in paradise heavenly father lord we thank you for your grace in this mother day father you are bringing us this grace again that is beyond the human being where the law can corner us the people can condemn us the people can look at us like we are doomed the situation may be tough like my daughter look like it's not gonna be a way out for my daughter it seems like the way she's behaving the way she is now the way she did this and this the way she insulted the message she is doomed father remember there is always an emergency bullet lord may we all cling to that grace because it's gonna be grace that will take us over there lord may your children never lose hope regardless of what it is even after death you rose lazarus when all hope was gone you always showed up lord and show that you are the one that have the last word father i pray
