[50:52] where we left
[50:58] it has been almost 3 month going toward
[51:01] four month that we've been dealing with
[51:04] the subject like I say like Sunday God
[51:07] is using different angles to bring you
[51:10] the same Revelation so I believe the you
[51:14] already suak this pretty good so now
[51:17] we're going to enter into things that
[51:18] are
[51:20] deeper because we could not get you this
[51:23] if you give this quickly and somebody
[51:26] did it get the whatever we went through
[51:28] three month the first thing you're going
[51:30] to reject it because you will think
[51:33] we're worshiping am
[51:36] man amen so we have to clarify the third
[51:40] person of the Trinity very good amen
[51:45] amen uh this message we need to get into
[51:49] real business amen amen let's go to
[51:53] Psalm
[51:55] 82 5 attendant so prepare for takeoff my
[52:00] subject this
[52:02] morning in the wedding I met uh an
[52:05] invisible audience there the MC himself
[52:09] was an invisible audience at the end he
[52:11] said brother Steven I follow you I'm
[52:13] from Canada we on Joseph uh the five
[52:17] government of Joseph so I don't know how
[52:19] far you going to go I say I don't even
[52:21] know
[52:22] myself so he was so good he said at
[52:24] least I can see you and Shake Your Hand
[52:26] say oh it looks like everywhere I'm
[52:28] going there is an invisible audience
[52:30] somewhere but we praise God for it my
[52:33] subject this morning is our life journey
[52:36] through Joseph's fa garment part 49 and
[52:41] the theme that we will be dealing with I
[52:44] don't know what you did sister rof but
[52:46] return my uh volume where he was
[52:50] please what we will be dealing with will
[52:53] be Thrones
[52:57] I put that in plural thrs
[53:01] plural and the
[53:03] Mystery you should not be afraid from
[53:06] the word mystery
[53:08] now if you afraid you got a problem you
[53:11] got a problem with the entire message
[53:14] the mystery of incense and
[53:17] blood amen so follow me very
[53:22] carefully because I don't want to lose
[53:24] you we're going to dig into something
[53:27] amen let's pray Heavenly Father Lord we
[53:30] are approaching you again humbly this
[53:32] morning Father we thank you for your
[53:35] grace your love your mercy and for
[53:37] everything you have been doing for us
[53:39] father this is as far as I can do with
[53:42] the ability that you have given us but
[53:45] when it comes to preach to minister to
[53:47] your children to teach it doesn't take a
[53:50] human being it takes the Holy Spirit
[53:52] himself to come down and to be the one
[53:55] speaking and the one Hearing in the ears
[53:58] in the heart of your children so father
[54:01] may you move everything that is contrary
[54:03] to your divine nature away from this
[54:05] place may your blood protect us and may
[54:08] you give us a wonderful service may you
[54:10] keep our hearts centered together on the
[54:13] revealed word bless those that are here
[54:15] and those that are streaming and will
[54:17] stream later as we commit it all unto
[54:19] thy hand we thank you for your presence
[54:22] Lord in the name of Jesus Christ amen
[54:26] amen
[54:26] wonderful singing the songs are already
[54:30] a message been preached
[54:33] amen the Bible says in Psalm
[54:36] 82 we going toward four month with this
[54:39] scripture the Bible says in verse one
[54:43] God stand in the congregation of the
[54:47] mighty you understand this very well he
[54:52] God judges among the gods you might be
[54:56] seen
[54:57] thank you verse six I have
[55:01] said ye are Gods so we know who are
[55:05] those Gods
[55:06] now amen amen we don't have any more
[55:09] question with who is Gods now we know
[55:12] who are those Gods like my wife was
[55:14] telling somebody it's so simple a child
[55:17] of a dog is a dog that's it that's it a
[55:19] child of an elephant is an
[55:22] elephant a child of a goat is a
[55:25] goat child of God is who
[55:29] God any
[55:31] question ah I have said ye are gods and
[55:37] all of
[55:39] you all of you so no one should be in
[55:42] that congregation hesitating no sir and
[55:45] say maybe they're talking about this one
[55:47] and not me all of you and the word is
[55:50] coming to all of you this morning all of
[55:53] you are children of the most high
[55:57] but you shall die like men that's the
[56:01] human part and fall like one of the
[56:05] princess when we spoke in the message
[56:08] show us the father and he will satisfy
[56:11] us in paragraph
[56:14] 8187 We found out that brother brandham
[56:17] said that man was the third person of
[56:21] the Trinity you remember that a you
[56:24] remember that amen uh if you see
[56:27] somebody too quiet shake
[56:30] them Amen brother Bram says that man was
[56:35] the third person of the Trinity the Holy
[56:39] Spirit are we clear so we found out that
[56:44] God God himself have three offices there
[56:49] is an office that is called the
[56:52] father there is an office that is called
[56:54] the son and there is a third office that
[56:58] is the holy ghost or the Holy Spirit are
[57:02] we together the father is God above us
[57:07] that's right follow me carefully my
[57:09] friend it is God above above us yes amen
[57:15] amen but the son is no more God above us
[57:21] the son is God With Us amen it looks
[57:24] like God is getting close
[57:27] uhhuh he's moving from somewhere and
[57:31] he's getting closer uhhuh he's getting
[57:33] closer to men amen amen he was above men
[57:40] now he is with men
[57:43] Emmanuel God With Us not with the tree
[57:49] not with the goat but with man because
[57:52] man was made in the image and likeness
[57:55] and the like of who God so men look like
[57:59] God
[58:00] [Applause]
[58:01] Amen are we together so God With Us God
[58:08] With Us amen God With Us amen but the
[58:15] Holy
[58:18] Spirit it is not it is not different God
[58:23] it is the same God Amen amen the same
[58:27] God when he was Tabernacle in one
[58:31] person he became the son are we together
[58:35] now it was God With Us which who was the
[58:38] Lord Jesus Christ but the holy ghost or
[58:41] the holy spirit is no longer God above
[58:45] us oh god with us so God is no longer
[58:49] outside of
[58:51] us now it is God in us amen
[58:58] amen
[59:00] God
[59:01] in in who us who is
[59:06] US amen amen God was
[59:13] condescending God was coming
[59:16] down amen amen and his purpose was to
[59:21] get into men amen so now if you want to
[59:24] find God
[59:27] [Music]
[59:28] [Applause]
[59:29] [Music]
[59:34] over here you need to find God
[59:37] somewhere sometime he's on top of the
[59:40] mountain the mountain call
[59:43] S sometime he's in the Tabernacle you
[59:47] need to enter inside the Tabernacle to
[59:49] see the pillar of fire sometime he is on
[59:52] the burning bush are we together you
[59:55] need to go find the burning bush and
[59:57] find God you need to go to MB the
[1:00:00] Mountain of God to see God Amen but when
[1:00:04] God entered Jesus Christ heaven was
[1:00:09] empty are we together if you want to
[1:00:13] find God God was only in one
[1:00:18] place in other word Jesus Christ lock
[1:00:24] God I'm going so I told you this is
[1:00:26] getting deeper in other word Jesus
[1:00:30] restricted the movement of God God in
[1:00:34] Jesus could not go
[1:00:38] anywhere are we together are we together
[1:00:42] that's why that's why Jesus say the
[1:00:46] father is greater than
[1:00:50] me because the father is god without a
[1:00:54] veil

[1:28:07] is not a location the father is a person
[1:28:12] do you follow me amen ah he says this he
[1:28:15] says on verse n and when he had spoken
[1:28:18] these things while they beheld he was
[1:28:21] taken up and a cloud did what receive
[1:28:24] him out of their sight do you understand
[1:28:26] what I mean so God Jesus they saw Jesus
[1:28:29] rising up and suddenly a cloud because
[1:28:34] he was during the day came and wrapped
[1:28:39] Jesus follow me and when the cloud WAP
[1:28:43] Jesus Jesus
[1:28:46] disappear but we know that the cloud has
[1:28:50] a
[1:28:52] mystery when Moses met God he met him as
[1:28:57] a pillar of fire and that Pillar of Fire
[1:29:01] was
[1:29:02] talking are we together am now during
[1:29:06] the night that light was a pillar of
[1:29:08] fire because he gave also natural light
[1:29:12] are we together amen but during the day
[1:29:16] that light itself turned into a
[1:29:20] cloud so a cloud is the pillar of fire
[1:29:24] in the day
[1:29:28] version if I lost you raise your hand my
[1:29:30] friend I told you I'm taking you deeper
[1:29:32] my friend the cloud is the pillar of
[1:29:35] fire in the day version that's why this
[1:29:39] picture here because he was during the
[1:29:42] day he have to appear as a
[1:29:45] cloud insulting this picture is
[1:29:48] insulting God
[1:29:52] amen amen amen are we together amen are
[1:29:56] we together amen so because Jesus was
[1:29:58] going through in the day what happened a
[1:30:00] cloud came follow me and the cloud open
[1:30:05] up amen and Jesus got inside the cloud
[1:30:10] not in the heaven not in the sky there
[1:30:13] was a cloud that open up and Jesus got
[1:30:17] inside the cloud the way your movie
[1:30:19] shows you is Jesus is going passing the
[1:30:22] sky and everything that's movie this is
[1:30:25] not movie this is
[1:30:27] reality amen the movie they do they are
[1:30:31] they are making movie according to their
[1:30:33] understanding without Revelation the
[1:30:36] true meaning is when Jesus went up a
[1:30:39] cloud came and a cloud open up and Jesus
[1:30:44] enter into the cloud follow me it's like
[1:30:47] a magician trick and and the cloud
[1:30:51] closed do you follow me when the CL Clos
[1:30:54] Jesus
[1:30:57] disappear we clear now we clear now the
[1:31:00] Bible says in verse uh 10 and while they
[1:31:05] look steadfast toward what heaven not
[1:31:08] toward the
[1:31:10] cloud they were looking toward heaven
[1:31:13] but the cloud already took Jesus amen
[1:31:16] toward Heaven as he went up behold two
[1:31:20] men stood by them in a white appal which
[1:31:24] also said you men of Galilee why stand
[1:31:28] you doing what gazing up into heaven
[1:31:31] this same who Jesus which is taken up
[1:31:36] from you amen into heaven into what
[1:31:39] heaven the cloud took him and he
[1:31:41] disappear and the cloud now begin to
[1:31:44] drive toward
[1:31:46] Heaven are we together the cloud let me
[1:31:50] go easy way elementary way God send an
[1:31:56] airplane the airplane is the cloud
[1:31:59] because you need to understand this when
[1:32:01] I will get to the Rapture you will
[1:32:03] understand how the cloud are coming to
[1:32:06] pick us
[1:32:07] up then you understand what happened to
[1:32:10] the Rapture but I'm not going to get to
[1:32:12] that God sent an airplane a spaceship
[1:32:15] called the cloud amen so the cloud open
[1:32:19] up and Jesus enter in and they close and
[1:32:22] now the airplane is heading toward
[1:32:25] heaven but that airplane is a cloud
[1:32:28] which is also a pillar of fire in other
[1:32:31] word if you talk to that cloud that
[1:32:33] cloud will answer you that's right there
[1:32:36] is somebody inside the
[1:32:38] cloud in the Old Testament that cloud
[1:32:41] was talking and we didn't know who was
[1:32:44] there but Jesus in John in uh in act
[1:32:47] chapter one he's demonstrating to us
[1:32:51] that the one who was inside the pillar
[1:32:53] of Fire
[1:32:54] it was
[1:32:55] me the Jehovah of the Old
[1:32:59] [Music]
[1:33:00] Testament is Jesus of the New Testament
[1:33:04] the man that was talking to Moses inside
[1:33:07] the pillar of fire that was me to prove
[1:33:11] to you I'm entering inside and I close
[1:33:14] the door now I be I'm going
[1:33:18] back I am back to the Father the father
[1:33:23] was the pill of fire amen the father was
[1:33:26] the cloud am now I left the pillar of
[1:33:29] fire I became a human being I'm leaving
[1:33:32] the human being I'm going back again to
[1:33:35] become the pillar of fire again amen
[1:33:39] that's the reason why when he met Paul
[1:33:42] on the road to
[1:33:43] a he came again as a light and Paul ask
[1:33:48] the light who are you and the light
[1:33:51] repli I am not I am who Jesus he never
[1:33:56] say I am Jehovah because now the mystery
[1:33:59] is unfold he said now I am Jesus in
[1:34:03] other way the Jehovah the God of Moses
[1:34:06] the god of Abraham the God of all the
[1:34:10] Old Testament s now it's
[1:34:13] [Applause]
[1:34:15] [Music]

[1:34:53] there amen I know it's a lot of question
[1:34:55] is rising
[1:34:57] up we clear amen like I preach on a
[1:35:01] marriage I say something and the
[1:35:03] minister came after he say I did Stephen

[1:35:31] formed Man Out of the Dust was who God
[1:35:35] and the one who say it is not good for
[1:35:38] men to be alone was who how can God do
[1:35:42] something that was not
[1:35:45] good cite me with the scripture who said
[1:35:49] who form man alone why did he make men
[1:35:52] alone knowing that it's not good
[1:35:57] Hallelujah you see now now your pipe are
[1:35:59] open do you see now who says who made
[1:36:03] men alone who say it is not good for men
[1:36:06] to be alone God so why did God make
[1:36:08] something he knew he was not
[1:36:10] [Music]
[1:36:12] good keep that in a pocket let's move on
[1:36:15] with Hebrew are we together are we
[1:36:18] together open up the pipe my friend amen
[1:36:21] so the rainbow Tru can now say
[1:36:26] ah then we set for the
[1:36:28] catch amen amen in in Hebrew 1 verse 5
[1:36:33] if you dare you can say amen amen for to
[1:36:35] which of the angel said he at any time
[1:36:38] you are what my son watch very
[1:36:42] carefully this this day I have done what
[1:36:45] begotten thee so God is is birthing his
[1:36:48] sonre amen our human being we're looking
[1:36:51] at somebody with a pregnancy and now
[1:36:55] when he birth the pregnancy is uh I mean
[1:36:57] it's a baby different than mama that's
[1:37:00] not in
[1:37:01] Godhead in
[1:37:03] Godhead when Mama give birth Mama become
[1:37:08] the baby mama disappear if you say where
[1:37:11] is Mama look at that baby that baby
[1:37:13] become mama in Godhead so when God give
[1:37:18] birth the think God is birthing become
[1:37:21] God himself in other word god birth
[1:37:25] something and get into that thing and
[1:37:27] the first form of God disappear that is
[1:37:30] the teaching of the God have the Bible
[1:37:33] say you are my son this day I have what
[1:37:36] begotten thee and again I will be to him
[1:37:39] I what a father and he shall be to me

[1:37:56] bringing the first come on
[1:37:59] brother the first begotten is he the
[1:38:02] last child when you say the first
[1:38:05] begotten it means what there are many
[1:38:08] more children that are coming
[1:38:11] amen you see now you see now if you have
[1:38:16] a child you would say I brought my child
[1:38:18] but if you say this is my first one it
[1:38:21] means there is another one and God
[1:38:23] saying the first begotten am so Jesus
[1:38:26] was the first born am so they must be
[1:38:29] other children but here are God and all
[1:38:32] of you are children of the most
[1:38:36] high are we together now are we together

[1:38:48] the angel of God do what worship Him how
[1:38:51] can God bring a baby to worship Him
[1:38:54] because God doesn't share his glory with

[1:39:00] is born he will be called
[1:39:03] what wonderful and what counselor and

[1:39:14] how can a child be called Mighty God he
[1:39:17] will be called Mighty God Everlasting
[1:39:21] father how can a child be a father
[1:39:24] and not only a father Everlasting father

[1:39:41] amen are we together amen he says here
[1:39:45] verse
[1:39:46] uh seven and and of all the and of the
[1:39:51] Angel he says who make what his Angel
[1:39:54] Spirit uh-huh and his ministers a flame

[2:00:49] Commandments of the Lord concerning
[2:00:51] things which not to be done and shall do
[2:00:54] against any of them verse three if the
[2:00:56] priest that is Anointed do sin according
[2:00:58] to the sin of the people uhhuh then let
[2:01:00] him bring for his sin which he hath
[2:01:02] sinned a young bulock uhh without
[2:01:05] blemish unto the Lord for sin offering
[2:01:07] God good go ahead verse four and he
[2:01:10] shall bring the bulock the door of the
[2:01:12] Tabernacle of the congregation before
[2:01:14] the Lord uhhuh and shall lay his hand
[2:01:16] upon the Bullock's head uhhuh and kill
[2:01:18] the bulock before the Lord mhm and the
[2:01:21] priest that that is Anointed shall take
[2:01:23] of the Bullock's blood and bring it to
[2:01:25] the Tabernacle of the congregation yes
[2:01:27] sir and the priest shall dip his finger
[2:01:29] in the blood and sprinkle of the blood
[2:01:31] seven times before the Lord before the
[2:01:34] veil of the
[2:01:35] sanctuary and the and the priest shall
[2:01:37] put some of the blood upon the horns of
[2:01:39] the altar of sweet incense before the
[2:01:41] Lord go ahead which is in the Tabernacle
[2:01:44] of the congregation and shall pour all
[2:01:46] the blood of the bulock at the bottom of
[2:01:48] the altar of the burnt offering thank
[2:01:50] you very much so we found out when the
[2:01:53] sacrifice of sin which which was a young
[2:01:57] bulock or a cal was kill the blood was
[2:02:01] taken follow me my friend amen and the
[2:02:04] blood was placed in three places seven
[2:02:07] time he was sprinkle with a finger on
[2:02:09] the veil you know what it means then he
[2:02:11] was placed on the altar not on the upon
[2:02:14] the altar but upon the Horn of the Altar
[2:02:17] and then at the bottom we are still
[2:02:19] dealing with upon the Horn of the altar
[2:02:22] of incense amen now when we talked about
[2:02:26] this altar we found out that in the Old
[2:02:29] Testament the
[2:02:31] incense amen and prayer were parallel
[2:02:36] you remember this you remember this
[2:02:39] parallel in other words the incense was
[2:02:42] inside the Tabernacle and the Altar and
[2:02:45] the and the prayer was outside so one
[2:02:47] going one way the other one going one
[2:02:49] another way the only problem is they
[2:02:51] were going at the same time then David
[2:02:54] said that he want his prayer you
[2:02:57] remember last Sunday to be like incense
[2:03:00] are we together and we found out that
[2:03:03] the incense was placed upon the golden
[2:03:05] altar all the altar of incense and that
[2:03:08] altar have four HS everybody clear now
[2:03:12] according to what we saw we found out
[2:03:14] that that altar according to Exodus 30
[2:03:18] was placed before Dev because of sin and
[2:03:22] after the death of Jesus Christ when
[2:03:24] Paul came According to Hebrew Paul took
[2:03:26] the Altar and pushed it there and he
[2:03:29] became a direct
[2:03:31] line to the throne
[2:03:37] right did you hear the song that was
[2:03:39] sing this morning in the Old Testament
[2:03:41] the veil divided the Tabernacle the
[2:03:44] altar was here and the Ark of the
[2:03:47] Covenant was there with two Carib beams
[2:03:49] and The Mercy Seat when the ve was
[2:03:52] divided Paul took this Altar and moving
[2:03:55] from the holy Place into the holiest
[2:03:59] amen now the altar became Before the
[2:04:02] Throne are we together so whatever
[2:04:05] prayer goes right here it is Before the
[2:04:08] Throne it's a direct line Before the
[2:04:11] Throne are we together and the O and the
[2:04:15] incense have to be burned in the morning
[2:04:18] every morning and every evening amen you
[2:04:22] remember that yes sir every morning and
[2:04:25] every evening and then he have to be uh
[2:04:28] the altar have to be consecrated once a
[2:04:30] year are we together now according to uh
[2:04:34] Revelation 9 remember that the atonement
[2:04:38] the blood was placed not on the altar
[2:04:41] but on the
[2:04:43] Horn of the altar yes sir and according
[2:04:46] to Revelation
[2:04:48] 9:13 the Bible say and the six Angels
[2:04:51] son
[2:04:52] and I Heard a Voice one voice not voices
[2:04:56] One Voice from the four horns of the
[2:04:59] water golden altar so the four horns
[2:05:02] speak
[2:05:05] together are we together and when they
[2:05:08] speak they create one
[2:05:11] voice and when they needed to consecrate
[2:05:14] the altar they put the blood on the horn
[2:05:18] and it's on the horn that The Voice is
[2:05:21] coming out am are we together so that
[2:05:25] alt that voice that is coming out
[2:05:29] because this is on Earth in heaven we
[2:05:32] didn't have Veil we went through that
[2:05:34] that's right according to heaven the
[2:05:37] Throne of God is here amen and the altar
[2:05:40] is Before the
[2:05:43] Throne this is in heaven yes this is on
[2:05:46] Earth are we together the altar is here
[2:05:49] and the and the throne is right there
[2:05:51] are we together now we found out that in
[2:05:55] heaven a voice came out from the horn
[2:05:58] yes but this altar is Before the Throne
[2:06:02] so God
[2:06:05] speaks amen are we together but the
[2:06:09] voice of God is
[2:06:13] echo through the
[2:06:16] altar if it's too strong you tell
[2:06:20] me are we together are we
[2:06:24] together the throne is there amen are we
[2:06:28] together the alter is right here God is
[2:06:32] talking but the voice doesn't come from
[2:06:35] the
[2:06:36] throne The Voice is coming through the
[2:06:40] Altar and it's coming from the horn so
[2:06:44] the altar become an
[2:06:47] echo of God so God Speak if you got
[2:06:52] connection with the altar you will hear
[2:06:55] what God is
[2:06:57] [Applause]
[2:06:59] talking are we together are we together
[2:07:03] if I lost you raise your
[2:07:05] hand let me start it again the altar was
[2:07:09] placed there and the and the throne was
[2:07:12] there there was a veil the veil was
[2:07:15] ripped and Paul took them and push it
[2:07:19] now if you see God before God God there
[2:07:22] is an altar and that altar they burn
[2:07:25] incense and they burn the prayer of the
[2:07:28] saint right there so every prayer is
[2:07:30] Before the Throne it's a direct line
[2:07:33] Before the Throne are we together now
[2:07:37] when God speak his voice doesn't come
[2:07:40] from the
[2:07:42] throne God speak but the voice goes
[2:07:46] through the
[2:07:48] altar amen and come out amen amen are we
[2:07:52] together so if that alt is found in
[2:08:00] you because the altar is the
[2:08:03] church you remember that we went through
[2:08:05] that the altar was the church number
[2:08:08] four on Earth so when God speak the
[2:08:12] voice of God is heard through the church
[2:08:17] amen
[2:08:19] amen where is Christ
[2:08:24] let's go back to the beginning where is
[2:08:25] God in you so if God is talking in
[2:08:31] heaven who will understand
[2:08:35] God Hall are we together are we together
[2:08:39] his voice will go through the church the
[2:08:42] church and he will speak so God voice
[2:08:46] become the
[2:08:48] church that's why brother brandham said
[2:08:50] the Brad
[2:08:52] the voice and the Brad and the prophet
[2:08:56] all of them will say the same
[2:08:59] [Music]
[2:09:00] thing please follow me
[2:09:04] carefully there is no age where God talk
[2:09:07] to the people about being their
[2:09:12] mouth are we together the Bible say in
[2:09:15] the age of laisha God say because you
[2:09:18] are need no heart I will do what
[2:09:22] out of what so the church is
[2:09:26] where the church is where and brother
[2:09:30] Bram say what he means is the church is
[2:09:33] the
[2:09:34] mouthpiece of God so when God
[2:09:38] speak you not going to hear God you need
[2:09:42] to find the altar amen of God and the
[2:09:46] altar will tell you what God is saying
[2:09:50] amen are we together amen whatever that
[2:09:53] alter
[2:09:55] bound Heaven also whatever the alter
[2:09:59] losing Heaven also loses so God and the
[2:10:02] altar became
[2:10:05] one are we together are you following me
[2:10:11] amen what is coming up is getting deeper
[2:10:14] again the Bible says why the pram says
[2:10:18] that When Jesus ascended on high he gave
[2:10:21] gift unto men there was a What
[2:10:23] atmosphere where hung over the Earth of
[2:10:26] what darkness and what Gloom and what
[2:10:28] death and what and weary and the prayer
[2:10:30] could not what come up because the
[2:10:32] atonement was not what made so the
[2:10:35] prayer were blocked that's why they have
[2:10:37] to put blood upon the altar of prayer so
[2:10:40] that the prayer can go through are we
[2:10:42] together now follow me my friend
[2:10:44] according to Revelation 5 we found out
[2:10:47] that when he had taken the book The Four
[2:10:50] beast and and 24 L they did what fell
[2:10:53] down before the land having every one of
[2:10:55] them what Harps and golden V full of
[2:10:59] what oders which is ancers which are
[2:11:01] what the prayers of saints so every one
[2:11:04] of these creature had
[2:11:10] ANC
[2:11:13] am we clear amen how many people do we
[2:11:16] have there 24
[2:11:19] Elders there is 12 of them
[2:11:21] yes which is for Israel the patriarch
[2:11:25] are we together and there are 12 of them
[2:11:28] which are what disciples the disciple
[2:11:30] the Apostle the Apostle of Jesus Christ
[2:11:34] amen the Apostle of Jesus Christ and
[2:11:36] what else there four beasts and four
[2:11:39] beasts the Bible says that what that
[2:11:42] every one of them have what Harps which
[2:11:45] are what instruments no every one of
[2:11:49] them have harp and what golden VI golden
[2:11:53] V full of what odors which are what
[2:11:56] pairs of saints so every one of the 24
[2:12:00] elders and every Beast have
[2:12:04] incense and those incense are prayer of
[2:12:07] the same so the 12
[2:12:11] disciple or Apostle and the 12 patri
[2:12:16] were holding prayers of the saint one
[2:12:20] from the oldest
[2:12:24] are we together one from the New
[2:12:26] Testament and not only they but the four
[2:12:29] Beast also have also prayer of the S
[2:12:33] because the Beast were the
[2:12:35] anointing that were going through the
[2:12:37] edges but those anointing started in the

[2:33:48] Revelation he had he SP he cried out the
[2:33:51] justice of what blood of Abel cried out

[2:35:19] Testament that the blood does what
[2:35:20] speaks better things the blood is what
[2:35:22] speaking then the blood has got a voice
[2:35:26] and the voice of the blood is what the
[2:35:29] word
[2:35:31] hallelujah that is what makes it what
[2:35:35] whether it's right or wrong the word is
[2:35:37] identified by the voice of what the

[2:41:07] know how to express myself
[2:41:09] correctly the way I was supposed to amen
[2:41:14] because there is a
[2:41:16] mystery the Bible says in Roman 8
[2:41:20] likewise the what the voice of the blood
[2:41:24] does what also help with our
[2:41:27] infirmities so when you praying the
[2:41:29] spirit enter the blood enter the voice
[2:41:33] of the blood enter for we know not what
[2:41:36] we should pray as we ought but the What
[2:41:40] Spirit itself the blood the blood itself
[2:41:43] do what maketh intercession for us with
[2:41:46] what groanings which what cannot be
[2:41:48] uttered and he that search the heart
[2:41:51] knows the mind of what the spirit
[2:41:53] because he does what maketh intercession
[2:41:55] for the saint according to what the will
[2:41:58] of God so when you are praying the Holy
[2:42:00] Ghost also
[2:42:01] enter are we together amen when you
[2:42:04] don't know how to pray the Holy Ghost is
[2:42:07] correcting your praying that's right yes
[2:42:11] yes
[2:42:14] yes that's what the Bible says and I'm
[2:42:18] going to show you next Sunday that the
[2:42:20] Holy Ghost also magnify your prayer so
[2:42:23] if you ask for 1,000 God give you 10,000
[2:42:27] the Holy Ghost does that hallah don't
[2:42:30] worry see you next Sunday my friend are
[2:42:33] we together so when you praying you say
[2:42:36] I don't know how to speak well I don't
[2:42:38] know how to express well I did
[2:42:40] everything I can but maybe you will
[2:42:42] understand me when you begin to go like
[2:42:44] this that's right you take the
[2:42:46] blood blood and you put it
[2:42:49] when the blood comes the blood is a full
[2:42:53] coverage he brings every ingredient that
[2:42:56] your praying need you need power the
[2:42:59] blood locks they need life they even
[2:43:03] forget to ask for a good health the
[2:43:06] blood continue to put everything are we
[2:43:09] together even if you did something wrong
[2:43:13] the blood
[2:43:14] covers he say I know they didn't mean
[2:43:17] what they're trying to do they already
[2:43:18] asked forgiveness the blood cover that
[2:43:22] so that when he comes before God when
[2:43:25] God examine the prayer he said but this
[2:43:27] is Jesus Christ Jesus Christ prayer is
[2:43:31] always so your prayer must
[2:43:35] be this is the secret God bless you
[2:43:37] let's stand
[2:43:38] [Applause]
[2:43:49] go home my
[2:43:51] friend chew into this
[2:43:54] stuff amen there is a reason why we show
[2:43:57] you who you
[2:43:59] are so you understand who you are so
[2:44:02] when you are approaching God you need to
[2:44:04] first know who you are you are a fellow
[2:44:08] you are a God and now you are coming
[2:44:11] with the identity of the big
[2:44:14] brother amen like Jacob coming with the
[2:44:18] identity of the big brother amen The
[2:44:22] Voice remain the same but the touch is
[2:44:25] different your voice remain the same but
[2:44:28] once they take the blood and put it upon
[2:44:30] your prayer I will show you where
[2:44:32] brother brandham says that it is no more
[2:44:34] your
[2:44:36] prayer amen it's a different signal all
[2:44:39] together because the blood the spirit
[2:44:41] when he enter into your prayer it begin
[2:44:44] to correct the imperfection of prayer
[2:44:47] and the Bible say he Di does that
[2:44:49] according to the will of God in other
[2:44:52] words the Holy Ghost will know what the
[2:44:54] word says because sometime the Bible say
[2:44:57] we don't know what we need to ask the
[2:45:00] Holy Spirit knows for you to if you want
[2:45:02] this you should have asked God like this
[2:45:05] amen so the Holy Ghost goes to at right
[2:45:09] and put it in arite and at right turn
[2:45:12] around and say this is nothing but the
[2:45:14] truth and the god in William May Bram
[2:45:16] turn around he say who say something
[2:45:18] like
[2:45:19] ask what you want he was not brother
