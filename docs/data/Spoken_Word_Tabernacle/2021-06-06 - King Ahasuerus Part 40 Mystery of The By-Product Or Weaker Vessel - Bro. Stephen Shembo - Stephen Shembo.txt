so i'm gonna call sister zaddy up didn't you yeah you said you had one right good is everybody that um we reached out to about the group song is everybody listening to that and working on that pick apart now while you're listening to it find your voice there's soprano alto tenor and bass for the men or baritone i mean we don't have to sound perfect we're not going to practice like that but we do want to be familiar with the song the musicians are working on it as well and just listen to it you know over and over and over and sing with it and uh so when we can get together and practice it for our church dedication that we will be ready amen it's still a little strong up here brother david [Music] god bless you saints this morning there was a scripture that came from the bible app excuse me i'm sorry and it just spoke to me um and it just reminded me i know brother stephen was talking about you know giving god praise and i don't think we give him enough glory i'm sorry i was going to read the scripture but you'll understand it by the song um basically the scripture was talking about um giving thanks onto god and just giving him the praises that he deserves um and it just for some reason had a profound um effect on me this morning i was like you know a lot of times i go to church and you know you rush you come to worship god but yet he gets just a little bit just a little clap just a little song just a little you know emotion and then after that you go back to your normal life like as if he doesn't exist and so this morning um i want to sing this song as a testimony but also as a praise unto god just for what he's doing and my life and not only my life but a lot of people's life and that i just want to let know that he's that we're thankful for for everything he's doing but just to encourage anyone who is struggling he's able as a song exceedingly abundantly above all can't ask him for according to the power in you [Music] god is able to do just what he said he would do he's going to fulfill every point to use here's the most important part [Music] don't give up on god cause he won't give up on you he's able god is able to do just what he said he will do [Music] he's going to fulfill you every promise to you so don't give up on god because he won't give up on you i'm singing again don't give up on god because he won't give up on you he's able to able if you believe in church sing it to him he's able again he's able he's done it for me he can do it for you he's able said god is able to do just what he said he will do he's going to fulfill every promise he's going to fulfill every problem is to you so don't give up on god so don't give up on god cause he won't give up on you [Music] don't give up on god cause he won't give up or just encourage anybody who's struggling don't give up on him so don't give up on god cause he won't give up on you he's [Music] hallelujah glory come on i was telling brother john to just move on move on after brother after sister's daddy can sing that i mean i don't want to get up here but he told me to come anyway so we'll be obedient this morning [Music] stand [Music] standing here not knowing how we'll get through this test [Music] but holding to faith you know best nothing can catch you by us you got control now we know you made a way when our backs were against the wall and it looked as if it was over you made a way i'm grateful for that and i'm standing here only because you made a wave and now we're here looking back on where we come from because of you and nothing we've done thank you lord to deserve the love and mercy you show your grace was strong enough to pick us up and you made a way thank you lord when my back was against the wall and it looked as if it was over you made a way and now we're standing here only because you made and we're standing here now we're standing here only because you made now we're standing here now we're standing here only because you made a way i love this part right here i love this part it says when you move the mountains you cause laws to fall with your power perform miracles there is nothing and that's impossible and i'm standing here only because you may you move mountains you move them mountains or you cause walls to fall with your power thank you lord he performed miracles and there is nothing and that's impossible and we're standing here only because you made away and we're standing here only because you made a way and we're standing here only because you made you made a way you made a way as they keep playing that keep playing you made a way yesterday i was talking to brother kelly and i started to share a little bit of my testimony with him and when i look back on where god brought me from a lot of you don't know my testimony and if you come and ask me i'll share it with you but there was one point in my life when i was 17 years old that that i got too far from god i started straying and i started becoming a hindrance in the church and it resulted in my pastor kicking me out of the church i was in a message church but that's the way the pastor felt led he felt led to kick me out because i was such a hindrance but that's what it took for my life to get sincere with god that's what it took and he knew that and god knew that and he had a lot of persecution for that oh you kicked a 17 year old out of church no one understood but god knew what i needed and that's what it caused for me to dig in dig into the word dig into the message and get sincere with god and it gives it gave me a heart now for young people because i struggled and you really got to get in and know god for yourself because if you don't know god for yourself you'll grow comfortable being raised in the message so you gotta dig in and know god for yourself have a personal experience and don't let your life go through the muck and mire like mine did grab a hold of god early that's what our pastor's been teaching before the black dog can be released grab a hold know where you stand know what you believe give it to god so that you can move forward and not have the scars that i had to have but in the end of the day he made a way he made a way for me to be here he made a way for me to be part of the bride he called me to this just being in church just being a member of the bride that's what he called me to and i'm grateful i'm grateful so when i sing this song and i say i look back on what he brought me from and i'm grateful i don't know why but i'm grateful it's personal to me because i saw my life in the past and i saw what god brought me to and i'm grateful church made a way and you moved in stupid knew the mountains you caught the walls to fall with your power perform miracles and there is nothing me being here today is a miracle that's impossible and we're standing here only because you made a way and we're standing here only because you made [Applause] i see you move you're moving mountains and i believe i'll see you do it again you made a way [Music] when there was no way and i believe i see you do it again one more time i see you move you're moving mountains and i believe

offering amen thank you very much musician and i appreciate each one of you for cooperating i know starting the service at two o'clock it's not fun it's not like 11 o'clock but there could be a special service that god wants to do something just his own way amen so i'm really really encouraged to see the amount of people that came in god richly bless you i thought probably some will stay home and stream after eating and everything but it looks like we got some prayer warrior amen people who love to be the church may god remember this day and grant you the desire of your heart amen blessed be the name of the lord continue to pray for us lord's willing in the couple of weeks or two or three weeks that are coming we should have the carpet on we should have the chairs on we should have the floor on we should have the bathroom ready so the main thing is the parking the parking is a big big big big big thing there but there is no mountain grader that can stand before zero belt amen so we're planning on probably asphalting part of the parking so we can get in and save some money and keep working working working so probably when we get in a building it's not really that it's finished it's just to get away from spending a lot of money here then get into the building and continue to save and continue with the work until everything is ready like the temple of solomon then we can get our dedication amen so pull on the brakes a little bit before i get there and somebody when is the dedication going to be there then when we get there when are we going to have the fellowship hall then we get the fellowship oh when are we going to have a new church so chill out okay okay amen okay we need you sometime we need to stir up the stuff a little bit but just no we're going slowly and we're going to get there amen i don't want to do stuff quickly and patch up work and we get there and one day this is not working this is not working then it doesn't look good amen so but robert has been working left and right i don't even know how to express it until you go there and you see him working then you will understand amen and we got brother preaching in brother david brother greg brother mikey delivered by the preston i can go on and on and on and on so just keep us in prayer know everything will be there and we shall be there before probably the lord comes back amen blessed be the name of the lord so let's go to our reading feels like 11 o'clock so nobody should be sleeping now you got plenty plenty plenty hour to sleep right brother robert i heard him somewhere okay so nobody should be sleeping got plenty hour to sleep woke up get coffee get breakfast go sit down and read your scripture and pray a little bit longer and all this kind of stuff amen let's go to genesis chapter 2. we're still continuing where we left last sunday and remember you need this to understand why the gospel seems to be tough to the women and why when you get into the way we should dress and the kind of shoes we need to wear it's not going to be a legalistic approach you're going to understand exactly why it is not appropriate for a woman to wear such a dress or for a woman to wear such shoes or for a man to wear such a paint and things like that amen if i just give it to you like brother brandon say don't do this don't do this don't do this so we go back again to the legalistic and then it's gonna be like why are you doing this it's because we are in a message not that way amen why are you doing this up in your bible amen that's the way we should be so i'm giving scripture young people go home sit on your computer when you have time get a piece of paper and say for earring one two three four paint one two three four nails one two three so you put it together and you make like your own study book so when somebody questioned you on why do you believe what you believe don't even mention my name amen don't even mention my name there amen use your own bible and tell the people open the bible this is where the scriptures say this is where the scriptures say this is where the scriptures say this is the scripture this is the scripture this is the scripture where do you know all of this god said ah anybody clear then you open up the door to brother branham amen so how can we get this stuff i want to get baptized then you can talk about brother stephen very far back then we can baptize them am i clear so i'm really down there genesis chapter two brother david give me more i'm good with that not brother john porter brothers verse 7 and the lord god for men of the dust of the ground i'm going back and forth because this scripture keeps popping up sister zadie it's not in there it's not a hazard you didn't know why you have to sing that song even able well someday you're going to begin to learn how the holy spirit to work and you will just begin to just relax you made me change the scripture back there you didn't even know i was looking for the third scripture the third scripture the third scripture and i got one and as soon as you sang that song the scripture came this is the scripture so i just pull it and change it on my slide right there so you don't know amen god will never give up on you amen he is able even if your back is to the wall brother about oh my god you see now now you understand okay get in contact with that man you will understand how he flows and the lord god formed man of the dust of the ground this dust is not the dust of eden you might be seated this is the earth this is eden remember and this is the garden of eden somehow on the east side everybody clear the north the south the east and there ever here no the north the south the west and there and there and the what eating on the east okay that's why you have to be on the east jesus hallelujah the garden of eden everybody cleared so far so god was somewhere here amen and he took the dust somewhere there and created adam spoke and adam pop-up everybody so far amen then and the lord god formed man of the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostril the breath of life and man became a living water and the lord god planted a garden eastward you see now you were the god that was made after man is already created it makes sense now so when they create man then the planted the garden we clear now then they took man and put him in the garden so man was not supposed to leave here what kelly he was not supposed to live on the other court make sense he was not supposed to live on the holy place anybody clear and he was supposed to live on the holy of the holiest anybody clear he was not supposed to live on the body he was not supposed to be led by his spirit anybody clear he was supposed to be led by his waters and he breathed the breath of life and man became a living water that's the first time the soul is mentioned in the scripture then they got to prepare a place for the soul anybody clear verse 8 and the lord god planted a garden eastward in eden and there he put man whom he had water you see where he put mans after he already created him clear jump to verse 16 and the lord god commanded the man saying of every tree of the garden you may freely eat but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil you shall not eat of it for in the day that you eat thereof you shall surely water is that word complicated so the commandment that was given on the girl on eden that commandment was simple it was not complicated it was very easy this is the entire world you need to live with it do everything you want to do in eden just live by this that's it they didn't have to go through the seal through the trumpet through the val all of them very simple word so the spoken word of adam was a spoken word given in simplicity anybody clear so far job 2 chapter 3 hallelujah you there that's a quite reading here now the serpent was more subtle now you know what saddle mean he knows your biology everything more than you do he knows biology very well so he knows the woman more than a woman i mean i mean herself he was the one teaching the woman everybody which the lord god has made and he said to the woman here has god say you shall not eat of every tree of the water number one he came bringing question against the spoken word of the hour everybody clear number one the therefore the way he brings you he attacks you when he attacks a church a woman he's going to bring question to the spoken word given by god through simplicity anybody clear so far so when somebody begin to question you about the message of the hour you need to raise your flag anybody clear brother brother even say a christian never ask a question to cause controversy if you need that scripture you see me that code brother branham says that amen amen you can ask a question what is the motive behind that question if you're trying to bring doubt to god original spoken word that is the devil anybody clear okay verse two and the lord and the woman said to the serpent if you notice here this serpent talk yes anybody here if you bring the elephant the elephant cannot communicate with a human amen everybody clear there is no bird that can communicate with humans here the parrot only repeat what human is saying without intelligence if you say to the parent how are you doing he said how are you doing are you okay are you okay it's echolastic it's just going back it's like you're bouncing against the wall but the only creature that was able to speak with men everybody clear and to reason with man and to give man an answer adequately was the serpent the snake does not talk everybody here that ability was removed in the garden of eden when god changed the form of it anybody clear and the woman said to the serpent we may eat of the tree of hell of the gardens but of the tree which is maybe in the midst of the garden god has said you shall not eat of it neither you shall not eat of it neither shall you touch it unless you water and the serpent said to the woman you shall not surely water the second thing the devil attack is to deny god spoken word of the hour number one is to bring you question when you begin to discuss with him in a question then he's going to tell you that it is not that if you miss the second the first approach once you get to the second one you need to wake up anybody clear for god does know the third thing once he denies to you the spoken word of god number three he's gonna open his own gospel amen everybody here because you are showing him interest you want to watch his video you want to watch his youtube damn he's going to open up the gospel anybody care so god knows that in the day you eat thereof then your eyes shall be opened and you shall be as god knowing good and what so in other words adam and eve did not know what was good and evil anybody clear good and evil was there but they didn't know job two verse uh job to verse seven and the eyes of them both were water and the water now they knew what did they know they knew that they were water what kind of fruit can somebody give you and just bring you the knowledge that you naked amen bring me that fruit and i give it to you amen that they were naked and they saw fig leaves together and made themselves water job 2 verse 9 and the lord god called to adam and said to adam where are you and he say i heard your voice in the garden and i was afraid because i was water for the first time that vocabulary happened to come out in the mouth of adam adam never uses that vocabulary before but the teaching of the serpent through the woman brought a new vocabulary through the son of god anybody clear because adam was the son of god and he said who told you that you were naked in other words that vocabulary is connected to one thing who told you that you were naked have you eaten of the tree whereof i commanded you that you should not eat watch very carefully and the men say the woman whom you gave to be with me she did water in other words i didn't know anything about this i was blind the one who opened my eyes and who taught me what to do is the one that you gave it to me anybody clear keep chasing and the lord god said to the woman what is this that you have water so the woman did something here what is this that you have done and the woman said the serpent did water brother branham says this he says that the serpent begot me do you know what big girls mean it means water everybody clear so somebody default change somebody design somebody by amen anybody clear not by creation anybody clear we're going to get into that sooner amen job to verse 15 and i will put enmity between you and the water so there was a friendship between the serpent and the woman you cannot put enmity where there was no friendship amen we okay now there was friendship before between the woman and the serpent no wonder he would call himself and come here sit down here there were close bodies [Laughter] hallelujah and i will put enmity between you and the water woman and between your seed and her seed the serpent seed it's right in the bible it shall bruise your head and you shall bruise his water jump to verse 17. and adam he said because you have hearkened to water remember there is a voice of evil the voice of the woman and have eaten of the tree of which i command you saying you shall not eat curses the ground for your sake in sorrow shall you eat of it all the days of your life job to verse 22 and the lord god say behold the man is become as one of us to know good and evil and now lest he put forth his hand and take also of the tree of water god never taught them not to eat of the tree of life so the tree of life has been there all this time they never were interested to eat that tree only the forbidden one amen lest he put forth his hand and take also of the tree of life and eat everybody clear and live forever therefore the lord god sent him forth from the water the garden of eden to till the water from where he was water not to till the ground of eden are you clear god took man and put him in the garden of eden and told him to till the ground of eden the grand of eden had no sorrow it was not painful he was a leisure of label but the ground that was outside of eden was a different ground anybody clear now let me go back again therefore the lord sent him forth from the god and in other words get out from this place now go into water into eden eden which represent the holy place all which represent the water the spirit which is the intelligence the intelligence or the understanding anybody clear in other words because you bite on the wrong tree you're gonna be leaning upon your own and when you lean upon your own understanding you're going to be suffering are you are you are you with me remove you're not going to be living in your soul anymore you're going to be depending on your spirit you're going to be depending on your intelligence you're going to be depending on your understanding and when you depend on your understanding you're going to have headaches are you there that's why when solomon came solomon said lean not unto their own water in other words go back again to live with the heart in your understanding you're gonna work all night like peter and you will catch nothing everybody clear but when you go back to the world to the heart at your word i will cast the net are you following me and one cast the net won't feel and they don't know even how to retrieve it the labor is easy it doesn't depend on your effort anymore it is god telling you god do such and such business and when you do the business you are automatically blessed because it is not your intelligence that sends you to the business but it is god who sends you to that business that's why the business work if something happened to that business you go back to god you don't have to even suffer you don't have to try to figure it out you say you the one that gives me the business take this mountain away from my business hallelujah you don't want to work in eden you want to work in the garden of eden hallelujah therefore the lord god sent him forth from the garden of eden to till the ground from where he was water now you can see he was not taken from eden he was taken outside of eden clear now verse 24 and so so i'm sorry he drove out to the men and he placed at the water east of the garden of water right there caribbeans remember the caribbeans were in the holy of the holy you understand now carribeans and a flaming sword which turned everywhere to keep the water the way to water in the hebrew non-process that but into the second went the high priest alone in the holy of holies once every year not without blood because it's a flaming sword judgment is turning around there which he offered for himself and for the error of the people the holy ghost this signifying signifying that the way into the water of all yes was not yet made water you see now because it was blocked that's why when jesus died at the cross veil of the temple was ripped in the middle telling you now you can come back to eden are you there because the blood of jesus christ is offered one time for all and he make a way so that we can go even if our back is to the wall [Applause] [Music] [Applause] hallelujah let's go to second corinthians 11. oh glory to god hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord second corinthians chapter 11 if you dare you can say amen brother robert remind me on the timer don't want to go over amen hallelujah second corinthians chapter 11. you dare you can say amen remember when the devil attacks what is what does he do number one bring question number two denied that word and he opened his own water let's see paul second corinthians chapter 11 verse 2 for i am water jealous over you with godly jealousy for i have inspired you to how many husband ever here when god created eve eve was created for how many husband and who took eve and introduced eve to adam god himself from one husband ever here that i may present you as a chess virgin to her everybody clear if you study marriage and divorce you will see that polygamy was entered ever here i know i'm online so i know which gear to use ever here but if you notice adam never was a polygamist [Music] is everybody okay about never was a polygamist are you there the first polygamist in the entire world the one that took opportunity came from the lineage of cain did you ever thought about it do you know that scripture do you know it ever here do you know it some are shaking the hand no yourself i don't want you putting it on pressure because you need more stuff are you there keep your finger on second corinthians let's go back to genesis oh god by the way i'm sick by the way i'm saying whatever i'm saying by the way i'm saying everybody clear go to genesis chapter 4. by the one i'm saying man can a man can you can't even handle one woman one your head is spinning and you want to hide them all one you already have blood pressure amen oh my god what a brand i'm saying whatever i'm saying genesis chapter 4 verse 17 and ken knew his wife and she conceived and bore who this is the lineage of the devil and and built and he enoch built a city and called the name of the city after the name of his son who verse 18 and to enoch was born who arrayed an arid father who mehujel and mahuja father who made two cells and methuselah father who lamech verse 19 and lemon took to him how many wives who was the first polygamist in the entire world do you see now did the abraham what let me ask you a question was abraham looking for another woman abraham had one woman she was buried and he continued to stay with one woman the one who made abraham poligamis is the teaching of sarah everybody's here ever here and later on sarah say cast edgar away ever clear then abraham remained with sarah did he have another woman but one sarah died then abraham marry another after the death of sarah everybody clear was isaac polygamist can you answer jacob become polygamist by circumstances he worked for rachel his father-in-law pushed leah he never had an intent to marry leah you see now and the white shirt because she was buried remember the gospel of sarah and pushed her concubine now he ended up by fall because leah said ah she did that i'm gonna do it also push it again do you see now what is stephen what about david right right what about david do you know that david was married to saul's daughter you know that amen and when david was running away do you know what they did to his wife what did that do to her and guess what he have to marry another one let's go back to second quarantine the woman make the woman make the woman can't demand the man handle your wife first amen you go they had these women these women you're still talking about polygamy second corinthians 11. you want to marry four or five wife go find another pastor not me second corinthians 11. in case somebody online so what does he believed in shortcut verse 11 verse 2 for i am jealous over you with godly jealousy for i have inspired you to one husband that i may present you as a chess virgin to christ the second adam just like i presented eve to the first adam she was virgin verse 3 but i feel paul what are you feeling lest by any means as the serpent did water began eve through his water so the means that he uses through that biology biology knowledge where did paul learn that amen through this subtlety that your mind should be corrupted brother michael from the water from the water do you see that from the simplicity that is in water that's why the message is so simple everybody verse four four remember when you get this denied from the simplicity what does he do he opened a bad word watch verse watch paul again for if he that can preach his wealth do you see this another gospel you see now if why is paul saying another gospel because he said go back to eden look what happened to eden look what the serpent did how he began eve how did he be garlic by bringing question to the spoken word by denying the spoken word then he's gonna bring his own gospel now paul is telling you he's bringing another you see now for if he that comes preaches that serpent another who whom we have not worked so there was an original gospel that was already preached but this is a second gospel another gospel which we have not preached watch or if you receive another water god spill goes with spirit because the spirit and the world are water so when you receive a different gospel you're gonna be anointed with a demonic spirit that goes with the gospel are you there which you have not received or another gospel which you have not accepted you might well bear with who jump to verse 13 for such a who deceitful worker transforming themselves into the apostle of water to seduce about here and no mother for satan himself you see now trump is transformed into an angel of water therefore it is no great things if his minister also so he also had preachers be transformed as the minister of water whose end shall be according to the earth let's go to ephesians then we pray hallelujah ephesians chapter 5 amen these are channels we open so when you go throughout the week the holy spirit keeps talking to you keep bringing stuff up amen before you know it it's friday but your mind is filled with revelation and river you know i was reading in the scripture i never saw this before now you begin to get into good grounds amen ephesians 5 25 husband loves your wife even our christ also love the church and gave himself for it that he might do water and clean said if you want to sanctify something you cannot sanctify something that is already holy so something fair fallen back here something must be dirty for you to clean it make sense that he must sanctify and cleanse it so he was dirty with the washing of the water by the word that he might present it to himself not to somebody else anybody clear so that weakness that you found you clean it up for yourself amen not having spot or water so this bride had weak spot and head wrinkle now when christ comes he's gonna remove that weakness out make sense now because if she was perfect what are you going to correct so something was wrong so when redemption comes he's going to correct forever that which was wrong hallelujah with that spot or wrinkle we already explained you this one is the change of the body and the spirit glorified or any such thing but that it shall be holy and without water so ought men to love the wives as their own body he that loves his wife love himself everybody clear now let's pray heavenly father lord we thank you again for this afternoon for your grace your love your mercy and giving us another opportunity regardless of the schedule that we can gather together around the reveal world of the hour lord may you move me completely out of the way and my old father may you come and minister unto us speak to our soul touch our body father respond to our need lord father may everything else be sealed completely out of this place may only the holy spirit and the angel of the lord be lord welcome in this place to bless and fill your children in the name of jesus christ amen god bless you let's go it's on part 40 we were dealing with adam and eve and the creation of the woman or the creation of eve last week the first point that we we saw was that the woman was the man door that the devil uses anybody clear to number one to carry his seed you remember he used eve to carry his seed and when god was about to destroy the entire world by water the devil took his seed and planted in the woman and the wife of him carried that seed over and reproduce the serpentine everybody clear so it's the main door that the devil uses to carry the seed and also to propagate his gospel hey but here the second main point that we found last week was that the woman was created by god and not by the devil everybody cares so far brother branham says this again in perseverance he says and such a conception my eve looked like some kind of pre prehistoric animal so somebody painted that let me go back i was in rome and i was done in and looking at where a greek artist has painted the conception of adam and eve in the garden of eden and such a conception my eve look like a kind of prehistoric animal and adam had never seen such a thing in my life in other words it looks horrible it just goes to show what the carnal mind can draw up when it's not converted to the glory of god in other words they cannot catch the man of god i believe eve was the water the prettiest woman that ever lived on the earth that's right because she was water freshly made by the hands of who by the hands of god without any water to do what sin originated in heaven so sin was already with the devil when the devil came in the garden of eden he was already a sinful devil but brother branham is telling you that the one who created eve was god without sin in other words without an intervention of the devil a woman was created by god ever clear made by the hands of god without any sin to touch adam the most perfect man that could ever live outside of who because he was the second water the most perfect man in other words a woman was created by god but they designed that brother branham spoke was the design not by creation by the design by water by perversion everybody cleared so far that was the main second point that we seen the third one that we seen was that when god created this woman god loaded this woman with three sacred virtues anybody clear the first one is virginity the second one is womanhood the third one is motherhood everybody clear and when the devil defiles eve the devil in one shot destroyed all three everybody he destroyed the virginity of evil he polluted the womb of evil but in order to destroy virginity and motherhood the first thing that they therefore work on is womanhood anybody clear womanhood is the behavior of a woman ever clear womanhood is the outer appearance of a woman anybody clear everybody clear the devil have to work on your behavior first the devil have to work on your clothing the weather i mean the devil have to work on your life first everybody when he gets you there then you're going to find yourself in the hotel ever here in the hotel it is no more to work on your clothing that is to destroy your virginity and then later on you're going to go in social service because you are a single mother amen amen here ever clear now the first point we want to introduce today is that through this relationship between eve and the devil this relationship introduced and hybridization of animal sexual driver anybody here when god created every species every species have to reproduce according to their category ever clear and the highest category was men so the way men had to reproduce was different than animals everybody here the animal could not mingle with the bird ever clear the bird could not mingle with the fishes ever clear and the fishes could not mingle with human beings but the relationship between the serpent and the and eve brought the animal sex drive into the human race now human begin to have feelings that animals were supposed to fear hallelujah leviticus chapter 18 verse 23 neither shall that lie with any water why do you attack brother branham on the serpent sea where did it start neither shall they lie with any beast to do what remember the suffering began me to defer their self there with neither shall any water stand before a beast to lie down therein there too it is a water it is a confusion where did moses learn this where was that door open because animal supposed to stay with animals fishes stay with fishes bird stay with bird human stay with women who opened the door between the beast and the woman and the human being leviticus 20 verse 15 and if a man lie with a beast an introduction of a animal sexualized into humanity if any man lie with a beast he shall surely be put to death and he shall slay the beast and if any woman approaches unto any beast and lie down there too that shall kill the woman and the water what savvy if was adam that was safe sarah for lying before god deuteronomy 27 verse 21 curse be he that lie with any manner of water and all the people shall say water in other words when man when god stopped took the serpent and destroyed the serpent completely he was a man he was an animal that could talk he was an animal that can reason with man he was an animal that can sit down with you and you can talk to him about politics you cannot talk to the elephant you cannot talk to the lion you cannot talk to the tiger but you can communicate with the serpent because that was the link between the two species so god took that animal and it completely you follow me and brought that animal into a snake but it was too late the feelings that the serpent gave to even if transfer those feelings to adam and even though god closed the door the human beings continued to do the same thing that's why when god spoke to moses he said tell them i don't want those kind of behavior where did it start because at the beginning it was not there the human the animal sex lust was introduced into the human being everybody clear so far brother branham hallelujah their unconscious thoughts keep them staring at snakes that lure of snakes is unconsciously water if you look even at the way the snake is moving something is wrong automatically there is like a natural repulsion with the snake if you love snake i need to sit down with you everybody here that he has been through the edges is seen by the people in generation after generation going through the same thing snakes have always been and always won't be water repulsively water it looks beautiful but yet you don't want to get around it everybody the snake has always stood for that which is water and water it can bite you ever clear it has been a water you know what it means i'll let you google that are you there it has been a phallic symbol through the water let me try to maneuver here pretty good the snake was a beast not a reptile the serpent he was a beast he was a beast that could talk he was a beast that could communicate with humans ever clear when god destroyed the snake god destroyed the snake with two things are you following me number one god destroyed the snake so that science could never find the missing link between the human and the animal that's why they took the chimpanzee they teach him in school he's still dumb as a monkey they took the dog they teach everything nobody but where is the species that is between the human and between the animal the closest one that was the chimpanzee what one of them said they found out big bones in africa and things like that and they keep looking at the bone but where is the species they can't find him ever here god destroy it number one so that science cannot find it because science comes from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil number two the way god destroyed the serpent ever clear he destroyed him and gave him a form you okay gave the serpent a form that looked like the very thing that he did are you catching me are you reading between the line that's what brother branham said it was a symbol a phallic symbol are you there a phallic symbol is that the serpent has the form of the very thing that introduces sin in the human life are you following me and not only that the male jesus look like the serpent are we getting better are you getting that in other words if you have questions on the edges look at him look at his thumb look at the way he is that is what causes the fall in eden the very form of a snake testify of the serpent seed doctrine if you didn't catch it you see me are you there it has been a phallic symbol through the edges just exactly as the guardian of hidden description we find the serpent the personification of a passionate evil it is almost universal amongst the various uncultured tribes that the snake is associated with water and often worship in conjunction with it the study of sexology brings that out in many instances now i would like to know where these people got that from seeing they are uneducated and never read the bible but even as the story of the flood is known throughout the world so is this truth of the fall of men do whatever they knew what happened there in water because remember the entire world lived to live in one place they already knew everything that happened in eden but through the babylonian empire of nimrod god brought the tower of babel down and separated them by language but not by knowledge are you with me the knowledge remain universal the language changes so they went too many different places carrying the same knowledge but under a different language that's why you see the deity of the egyptian matching the roman matching the greek because that knowledge was going throughout all even in asia they knew what happened but the confusion came by language and that confusion is restored in the day of pentecost where the holy ghost came down if you speak hebrew somebody is understanding you in his own language [Applause] glory to god everybody created so far brother branham says this i could prove by the bible that you are not in your right mind till you have found christ that's right that is pretty strong but i can prove that by the water did he give you the scripture go home and study that's right you become water and whatever and what you become beastly lustfully and everything until you find who why because the animal sex draft was introducing human you're going to behave like an animal that's why you'd have been in a nightclub sometimes you look at what you did you are even ashamed to tell somebody because you are reacting like an animal are you there how can a woman go to bed with three mans how can one man go to bed with ten women it's animal yet they do it hallelujah and you take the holy spirit off of a man he is water lower than what he is even worse than the animal why is he washed because the animal never sinned either the animal remain under the leadership of god god leads the animal by emotion and instinct that's why when the earthquake comes the beast don't die they run away and man is the one that died are you there so when man stoop down he goes below the animal hallelujah that is a hard thing to say but you take a man that is unregenerated in his mind without the holy spirit brother kelly to direct his thought and things like that he would throw a baby out of a mother's arm and ravish her for water he won't even remember that this is a mother with a children he would just rape him yeah rapper why is he that because the animal draft was introduced into a human it caused perversion everybody cleared so far the fourth point we're going to get into it [Applause] what a robert remind me on time is we saw the fact that the woman number five i'm gonna stop at seven if i can the woman was a by-product and that byproduct when we explained to you she was a weaker water because she was a product of the product amen the original were strong when they took the original and work it up again it becomes weak everybody follow me the first love is what agape everybody here if you degrade that gap what does he comes feel you if you degrade feeling what as he comes last fall if you degrade that's full when you get to as you work on the working product you are decreasing lowering the product anybody clear body problem not is but a byproduct and not is the only one of our god's creation of every animal anything else he was the only one designed this way not created this way anybody clear every other female was in the original water this creation brother branham is talking is in genesis 2. not genesis 1 genesis 1 man was created male and female in the image of god which is spirit but in genesis 2 it was the human body that's what brother branham is talking about people don't study and they make brother branham say things he didn't say are you there every other female was in the original creation but if was not in the original creation see that he had to be made that way well we get it we get to it after a while notice in this creation that she was in not in the original but a water okay there is nothing designed to be so what as a worker ah thank you the brother in the message will stop at the woman there is nothing designed to be so deceitful as a woman say amen that is not what brother branham said because the woman was created by god you need to read the prophet carefully not just put a tape to go to sleep you are asleep you are sleepy turn the tape off sleep we have created a bunch of legalistic people do you understand me when you are sleepy turn the tape off sleep are you there jesus came he found his disciples sleeping did he wake them up he said pray he looked he said they wanted to do that but their flesh is water sleep i would take care of the children are you there brother branham said when you fast and you hungry do what i cannot eat i cannot eat that steak looks so good you're not fasting anymore you fall you are killing yourself god god is simple be not like the pharisee who thinks by the multiplication of the word and the long prayer i'm gonna heal them go back to the garden of eden amen go back to the garden of eden you wake up in the morning you fresh put the tape hallelujah there is nothing designed to be so deceitful as a what a woman that is water a woman that is deceitful not a woman there cannot be nothing else there is nothing meant to be that way there is nothing that can be so easily deceived as a water because it was deceived easily now the fall proved this statement to be true the fall is before in the beginning she was not in the original beginning creation she was in what but not in there you see her brother branham is clear nothing in other words not in a woman body are you there herself at the beginning she was the by product doing what made where are you going body stephen hallelujah now you may ask me now why did he permit her to be designed thus anybody follow me in other words why is god instead of creating a woman directly why did he took a product and make another product we're clear we're on point five point five a brother branham i don't want to take too much time because i got a lot more to say here why the question may arise then why did god make this woman like this in other words a byproduct why did he permit her to be like that he was for his own water good and water this weakness was for god's own water relax everybody clear so far blessed be the name of the lord number two so he had to put man out there and make him on a free moral agency so he would knowing would fall and the man in his own image how could he fall now you're seeing daylight so he had to make a water a by-product something out of the water the river creation now you see it back here there you come then that is what fell what fell was not adam it was if that fell he made it knowing it would do water and it's put over in the hands of who for a while of water the woman was not a vessel of dishonor because she was created by god she was the perfect woman of the entire world she was god's own perfect thoughts of beauty everybody here that's but what brother branham is saying here that the devil treated the eve as a worker are we clear now are we clear now number b a vessel of water everybody here god did not created hell to be treated that way are you following me are you following me but when the devil came down in the garden of eden he looked at the lion man beautiful he looked at the female not beautiful he looked at the giraffe he looks at the male beautiful pretty you look at the woman not pretty everything the man prayed woman not prayed the man prayed it woman not prayed when he looked at the human he found adam not pretty but if beautiful he said why is this one different than any other creature you follow me now you follow me now this is the different one of all the species in eden everybody i look at the lion you can see the man lion he look royal you look at the woman nothing if you look at oh the bird you see the male is the one beautiful the female not but in the human it looks like something is opposite why is he opposite this is a door for me to begin to work you understand brother stephen where are we going hallelujah romans 9 verse 19 thou will say then unto me why did he find fault for who has resisted his what in other words why is god condemning them because if we are made what we are by the will of god who can resist the will of god i have to be what god wants me to be so if god made me what he want me to be why is he condemning his name that's what paul is saying nay but all men who are there that replies against who shall they think form are you following me say to him that from him why has that made me death in other words i'm the boss i do what i want to do and i'm doing things for my own are we okay i'm now i gave you brother branham i am granting you back in the scripture okay okay have not the who the power they have what you remember the woman have to wear hair for what power have not power over the water over the clay of the same lamp he makes one a vessel onto water and another unto what everybody cares so far now i'm going back to the scripture what if god willing to show his wrath and make his power known endure with much suffering the vessel of water so when god makes a vessel he have a purpose if he makes a vessel of wrath you follow me it is for god to destroy that vest so powerfully so that when you see that you say oh he's a god that can revenge my enemy do you understand that do you understand that he has a power to destroy your enemy you don't know that so to help you understand that he's creating certain individual to demonstrate his power so you can learn what he is to you are we okay let me navigate again what endure with much suffering the vessel of rough fitted to water they were predestinated to be destroyed everybody care that's why he was hardening pharaoh as he wanted he could have gone take israel out of egypt and put him in the promised land we would not have learned his power he took pharaoh and designed him to object everything moses is saying how can you have this destroy this destroyed this destroy this picture and you still don't understand are you all that is something supernatural god wanted to show his power that if my kids are in difficulty are you there i can destroy even a kingdom all the way and pick them up and pull them out hallelujah if the man lion is roaring it's not for the younger to be afraid he's giving fear to the jungle not his own children and then when he turned to the children he said what are you wearing attack are you there you see me roaring i'm rolling so they can tremble when they are already fever you just go and slay them and he did that for israel the bible said god was sending his fear before are you there so when israel come even defeat the one in israel he sees you you are trembling he said oh i'm feeble let me do the just a new day oh i killed someone and he keep going it's god who make you powerless hallelujah and that he may make known the water of his glory on the vessel of water he done this he done this he need to be cast out in the church it depends on which vessel he is are you there it depends on which vessel he is if he is a vessel of mercy adam will commit something wrong to rescue him let me go if it's vessel of mercy which he had therefore prepared for water somehow these are predestinated for destruction somehow predestinated for water now watch we're talking about the woman you ready now first peter chapter 3 verse 7 likewise ephesians 5 love your wife ye husband dwell with them who's them according to adam don't be full giving water giving water giving water giving water do you understand me husband don't treat your wife like the devil treaty thief [Applause] young man don't treat your wife like a serpent the serpent treated eve like a vessel of dishonor but you children of god give her water take genesis if i have to stop somewhere i have to stop because these have to enter very well treating your wife like a trash genesis 34 women the women we can vessel women was a byproduct her place is in the kitchen let her get sick go change that diaper you see the child with the diaper upside down go in the kitchen go cook call the pizza company you're gonna eat pizza for three weeks and you will appreciate that woman are you there are you there you're gonna appreciate that woman you're gonna turn around i don't know phone call how do

how you do it you know everything now handle it now handle it before you know it go ahead and watch on youtube you will appreciate that woman man hallelujah let's go to genesis 34 oh god i gotta stop somewhere genesis 34 let's go genesis 34 verse one and dinah the daughter of leah which she brought to jacob went out to see the daughters of the land and when she came the son of hammer the water do you see that seed priest of the country saw her he took her and lay with her and did what what did the devil do to heaven ever here job to verse 30 and jacob said to simeon and liver you know the story simone liver went and killed the whole city anybody care you have trouble me to make me to stink among the inhabitants of the land among the canaanite and the parasite and uh and i being few in numbers they shall gather themselves together against me and slay me and i shall be destroyed i in my house watch 31. and they said should he do what with her sister like a water this is a daughter of jacob you don't treat her any kind of way are you there so this man took our daughter and destroyed our daughter and you want us to sit quietly he treated our daughter like the serpent let me skip this one are you there let me skip this one likewise your husband join with them according to what you need to understand these mysteries are you there giving water because she's subject to be played with in the night club with trampoline who is on trampoline on the beat who is on the beat who is a magazine nobody value her i want you my children when you get one of them i want you to value him [Music] give honor unto the wife ask unto the water oh my god and as being water together as being wanted off the water did you hear that did you read that did you hear that you give her honor as us you are held together of the water hallelujah what does it mean first let me get that one when you give honor go to act 11. i'm trying to close to stop somewhere go to act 11. go to act chapter 11. you there you there how did the jews consider the gentile you remember that we went through that how did the jew consider the gentile the bunch of dogs right unclean people right having demons right they were closed from the commonwealth of israel they were outside without god without mercy are you there with the people of god after chapter 11 verse 1 you there and the apostle and the president that were in judea heard that the who had also received the water so when peter came and preached and came back the brother got upset where are you coming from you went and preached to those gentiles you know we cannot go to the gentle fine and peter verse 2 was come up to jerusalem day that way of circumcision did water they begin to argue with peter can you imagine somebody received the holy ghost and the people begin to get upset because someone received the holy ghost on the basis that because they are gentle in other words the holy ghost was only for us let's see first three saying you went into man wow and circumcised and did eat with them but peter he raised the mother from the beginning and expanded by order to them saying i was in the city of joppa praying and in a trance i saw a vision a certain vessel descending as he had been a great sheet let down from heaven by four corners and he came even to me upon the witch when i had fasted my eyes i consider and so four-footed beasts of the earth and wild beasts and creeping things and fall of the earth and i heard the voice saying to me arise peter slay and eat but i say not so who peter is answering god god is telling peter eat peter say no why is peter i'm answering that to god name a lord everybody care for nothing water all water unclean has at any time enter into my water that was the conception of peter by the law but the voice answered me again from heaven what god has what cleans that corn not you water in other words peter what you calling unclean in that vessel it is clean to me everybody clear so far jump to verse 15 and as i begin to speak in the house of cornelius the holy ghost fell on them as on who at the world in other words when i begin to preach to these unclean people the way they receive the holy ghost is no different than the way we receive the holy ghost you follow me you follow me verse 16 then remember i the word of the lord how he said john indeed baptized with water but you shall be baptized with the holy ghost for as much then as god gave them everybody give like gift as he did to us who believe on the lord jesus christ what was i that i could do what in other words god who is the boss declare these people to be cleansing and the way he gave them eternal life is exactly the same way he gave it to us making no distinction between the jews and the gentiles who am i
