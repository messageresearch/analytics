[0:10] then sweeping up to glory
[0:14] to see his blessed face where rivers of
[0:19] delight shall ever roll
[0:22] hallelujah he's the lily of the valley
[0:27] the bride and morning star
[0:30] he's the fearing to my soul
[0:37] hallelujah
[0:38] i hope you all know him that way as well
[0:40] amen
[0:42] hallelujah
[0:44] you can't have problems if you sing a
[0:46] song like that amen he is just
[0:48] all of that
[0:50] now this next song i don't know that
[0:51] we've ever sang it here
[0:54] it is an older hymn um i was reading um
[0:58] you know sometimes people post things on
[1:00] whatsapp you know uh like brother seth
[1:03] does a little bit and and i enjoy it
[1:05] because it's mostly pictures of him and
[1:07] his wife after church and they're just
[1:09] always so happy looking it's an
[1:11] inspiration to me
[1:13] but sister um rosemary earlier this week
[1:16] posted one
[1:18] and it's the scripture i know
[1:20] whom i've believed
[1:22] and he is faithful how does it go and
[1:24] he's and i'm persuaded
[1:26] that he is able
[1:28] to keep that which i've committed
[1:30] unto him
[1:32] this day against that day so we're going
[1:34] to sing that
[1:36] it's a song i know y'all know the song
[1:38] i just don't know that we've sang it in
[1:40] a while but i want to let her know i'm
[1:42] sure she's going to be streaming today
[1:44] she is on on um on her trip because her
[1:47] mom passed and we'll be praying you know
[1:48] we're praying for that but
[1:50] um
[1:51] i wanted to let her know that she
[1:52] inspired us to sing it that this morning
[1:55] there's a reason there's always a reason
[1:57] so
[1:58] i know
[2:00] not why god's wondrous grace to me
[2:06] he had made known
[2:10] nor why
[2:12] unworthy
[2:14] christ in love
[2:18] redeem me for his all
[2:23] but i know
[2:25] whom i have believed
[2:30] and i'm persuaded
[2:33] that he is able
[2:37] to
[2:38] keep that
[2:40] which i've committed
[2:44] unto
[2:45] him against that day
[2:50] i know
[2:52] not how this
[2:55] saving faith to
[2:58] me
[2:59] he didn't
[3:01] bond
[3:03] [Music]
[3:09] his word wrought peace within my heart
[3:17] [Music]
[3:23] [Music]
[3:28] he is able
[3:31] [Music]
[3:39] [Applause]
[3:41] [Music]
[3:45] i know
[3:47] not how the
[3:50] spirit moves
[3:51] [Music]
[3:53] convincing men of sins
[3:58] reaving
[4:01] jesus
[4:03] through his word creating
[4:08] faith in him
[4:12] but
[4:16] [Music]
[4:20] [Laughter]
[4:22] that he is able
[4:25] to
[4:27] keep that way type committed
[4:33] unto
[4:34] him against that damn
[4:40] i
[4:40] know not what of good or ill maybe
[4:49] reserve for me
[4:53] of where ways of
[4:58] golden days
[5:01] before his face i
[5:04] see
[5:07] but i know
[5:09] [Music]
[5:17] he is able
[5:20] to
[5:21] keep that coming
[5:28] that day
[5:31] now i know
[5:33] not when my lord may come
[5:38] at
[5:39] night or
[5:41] noonday then
[5:45] nor
[5:46] if i walk the
[5:49] bear with
[5:53] [Music]
[6:05] and i'm persuaded
[6:08] that he is able
[6:12] to
[6:13] keep that which i'd committed
[6:19] unto him
[6:21] against that day
[6:28] hallelujah
[6:31] hallelujah
[6:35] i know not how the spirit moves
[6:37] convincing
[6:38] men of sin
[6:40] revealing jesus through the word
[6:42] creating faith in him amen
