the scripture Genesis chapter 2. glory to God all these late stuff and those stuff are lack of that's why you get trouble in many areas you're not consistent amen you're not diligent amen how many knows brother Branham say the ears uh let me read one scripture and let's just say that because you've been standing for so long let's go Genesis chapter 2. if you wonder why we stand when we read the scripture you see me I will give you a scripture you there and Adam gave names to alcado you might be seated everybody okay blessed be the name of the Lord you need your Bible how many believe brother Branham says or knows that brother Branham say that Solomon time was the Golden Age of Israel amen in the in the time of Solomon everything prospered how many knows that you know that right everybody knows that and how many knows that when Solomon died Israel came to the child of Solomon and told him that the burden of Solomon was heavy upon Israel have you ever thought about it have you ever thought about it you don't know that scripture you know that scripture if you don't know I'll give you homework when Solomon died Israel came to the child of Solomon they say listen to us prayerfully your father's burden was so heavy on us go ahead Enlighten the burden and we will serve you so what looked like prosperity on the outside what looked like everything was blossoming a golden age everybody was doing good behind that was hard work I don't know if you get what I'm saying I'm not going to preach you an easy gospel buddy everybody care loudisha is very bad anybody care and I can't play a game with the message of the hour anybody here when we say Solomon or we see all the queens of Sheba he's he was sitting on the on the chair of God Ivory everything prospering the whole earth loves Solomon everybody is coming to Israel that's all you see but if you go to the book of King you're going to see that Solomon was a very strict and hard-working man have you noticed that in the scripture there is a reason why Solomon prospered there is a reason why Israel prosper they could not take any lazy people living on on the bed and watching tick tock [Applause] everybody care when you sleeping somebody in California is already on the stock market [Music] yes sir why are you sleeping somebody is already working in California because they have different hours than you [Music] done with big people you will see has her strict they are amen you don't have nothing you acting like you own everything sleeping good you love you don't worry about nothing glory to God [Laughter] young people happy when I begin to talk to them it's so good amen I love you so much that I have to shoot every devil I'm saying attack coming closer to you I don't give a Time amen I want you to be in places you go to reception and everybody is asking you which church do you go to not acting crazy in reception [Music] I am loaded I know what I'm talking about we need to talk about Vision you must have a vision usually the girls pick up a little bit quicker because of their cycle they understand things quickly but the boys are sleeping you told them do you know it was raining outside they don't even know you ask the woman the girl will tell you yes it was raining so Sam is sleeping sound deep the other one is sleeping with one ear let me leave it alone you will understand that later Genesis chapter 2. amen Oh Glory to God verse 20 Adam gave names to all Qatar who was giving names Adam and to the fowl of the air and to every beast of the field but for Adam everybody okay there was not found a help meet in other words suitable that feed him for him everybody okay so everything was paid two two two when Adam look he said your name is this this is the name this is the name this is the name next this is the name next no problem amen verse 21 and the Lord God will stop here last Sunday uh the previous Sunday and the Lord God calls a deep sleep to fall upon Adam thank you yes among the cuddle and the foul and the Beast that Adam was giving them the serpent was there everybody okay So Adam gave the serpent the name serpent [Music] [Laughter] Adam named The Serpent all right glory to God one service by the okargo is big amen verse 21 and the Lord God calls a deep sleep to fall upon Adam and he slept and he took one of his ribs not to one and close up the flesh he never left it open instead thereof let me skip that one leave it alone and the rib which the Lord God has taken from man everybody okay made here why do we call her woman who gave her the name woman who was giving the name to every creature Adam was not giving the name by his intellect everybody okay verse 22 and the rib which the Lord God had taken from man made he a woman and brought her to the man amen so a woman must be brought into the marriage that's why the woman entered with the garden because God walked his own daughter [Music] to the opening of the seals amen and Adam saying this is now born of my bones young people understand this and Flesh of My Flesh she shall be called water who gave the name woman So Adam named the woman amen so if you ask Adam who is beside you Adam must say woman Adam didn't say Eve [Music] I have to go slowly because where I'm gonna dig it different but here Adam was not saying Eve no he was calling her woman amen everybody okay Adam call woman because she was taken out of the water so a woman means water taken out of her man any question it's continued therefore shall a man leave his water and his water where is the mother of Adam I am now I hope you are training this church to know how to read the message and to read the scripture you don't read that's why you heard about the brand I'm saying you don't read scripture like a newspaper anybody here who was the father of Adam God but who was the mother of Adam let me leave it as we're coming down I know where I'm gonna head amen so God is also mother don't worry about it put it on the Shelf we will pick it up down the road there amen therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother and shall cling to his all right and there shall be one flesh everybody okay no problem do you see any things spoken about the serpent here verse 25 and they were both naked the man and his wife and were not water so this woman even though she was married she was still a virgin everybody okay foreign you okay as soon as the created Eve the scripture mention a beast the scripture never mentioned a lion they just say the Beast and the cuddle they didn't say there is an elephant there we know the elephant was there but they pull a certain Beast everybody okay now the serpent was more saddle we're gonna come back to this according to Genesis chapter 3 everybody here verse 1 we got a beast that is called a serpent his characteristic he was more saddle what does he mean anybody care he was sadder than any Beast they didn't say sadder than any foul the Bible didn't say sadder than any fish anybody here the Bible didn't say he was served out more than any reptile the Bible said he was more sadder than any so his category is what so this serpent is a beast here praise God he said he's more sadder than any beast of the field which the Lord Our God has made so God created a beast God did not create a snake everybody okay originally he was a beast not a snake are your eyes open our eyes open anybody here God never created the eve hey everybody okay God created the woman they'll name Eve came later amen amen hey everybody okay jump to verse 20 then we come back on one so it makes sense and Adam called his wife name water I thought he already why did he give his wife a name the second time everybody okay if because so there is a reason why Eve have to be given a name different than her first name and the reason is because everybody okay she was the mother of water [Music] what does he mean the mother of all living the children are your children why do you say my wife is the mother of all living amen if you ask my wife those children they're mine everybody here so why do you have to say that you see those those children are all those children belongs to my wife not belong to me Adam didn't say that they belonged to the woman [Music] brother Branham says this he said Adam call his wife Eve because she was the mother of all living that was after this beguiling has already took ready everybody okay brother born I'm saying now let me now let this be known scripture does not play with words this is what I want you to understand all along you should have caught that in this church every I have even a karma in a scripture means something everybody here even a punctuation means something a number means something [Music] a conjunction means something whatever is in the record is there for the anointed eyes to water so if you're not anointed you're going to be wondering why are we coming up with those stuff how do you see it everybody here it is there for us in that word it says in Genesis 3 20 and Adam called his wife name Eve because she was the mother of all but no scripture ever says that Adam is the father of all living [Music] if there is not this connotation to be placed upon Genesis 3 20. why would he be mentioned that Eve is the mother of all and no word say about Adam the fact is that though Eve was the mother of all living Adam was not the father of water not Adam now let's go back to three what let's pray because I'm already leaving the airport Heavenly Father Lord we thank you for your grace your love your mercy and for everything you have been doing for us father we are committing this service again unto their hand Lord may you move me completely out of the way may you come down and speak to your children may you anoint us in a special way so that we can grasp the mind of the spirit father touch us and heal those that are sick open our eyes so that we can be anointed this morning to see what the spirit one has to see father Lord we rebuke every demonic spirit away from us and commit everything unto their hand in the name of Jesus Christ amen everybody okay verse 3 now now the serpent was more sad we need to see what it means then any beast of the field which the Lord God has made and he said to the woman so he was not just a beast but he was a beast that could talk [Music] everybody okay no problem we will get it down the road amen he says yeah to the woman he says to the woman yeah God has God said You shall not eat of every tree of the water so the same here in Genesis 3 open up between the serpent but here and the woman not the serpent and Eve amen the serpent and a woman and this serpent is a beast hey better care so the sin opened up between a beast and a woman everybody okay glory to God let's go to chapter verse 5. skipping those for God does know that in the day you eat thereof then your eyes shall be watered and you shall be as knowing good and in other words being able to discern everybody here and the woman saw that the tree was good for food and that he was pleasant to the eyes and the tree to be desired to make one water so this best has presented to Eve our wisdom but here or something that can make Eve wise you okay you remember the Sunday eyes virgin we okay now you remember that okay she took off the fruit thereof and did it and gave also to her husband with her and he did it and the eyes of both of them were open and they knew that they were water she knew after she ate the fruit not before anybody here remember in Genesis through uh 2 25 they were naked they were nourishing everybody care and they saw fig leaves together because now they shame everybody here and made themselves water presently let's go to Ruth chapter three I'm going to skip some of them so we can climb quickly we on roof so we need to read roof if you dare you can say Amen oh God I mean move faster the other one I'm going to skip it I'm going to read one two three amen verse 3 chapter 3 verse one then Naomi her mother-in-law say to her my daughter shall I not seek water we're talking about the rest we started with the rest of God the rest of God took us down into the seals the seals to the Thunders the Thunder that's where we are now so we left the rest there we need to go back up again and pick up the other rest the scripture have layers [Music] do you understand the scripture have layers you have the first layer the second layer the third layer the fourth layer anybody here you can look at the first layer and you can pick up something and everybody can pick that up but if you peel that layer you will find another layer in the scripture okay that it may be well with you verse 2 and now is not boas of her Kindred you understand this with whose Maiden you were behold he we knoweth badly tonight in the trashing floor so we are still under the threshing floor verse 3 wash yourself therefore and do what so there is an anointing that roof took getting into the threshing floor there is an Oiler everybody care roof is entering the threshing floor with an oil with an anointing on her there is an oil everybody okay remember the two words okay praise God watch yourself and anoint you and put your Remnant upon you and get you down to the floor but make note yourself known to the man until he shall have done what and water so this oil is before the manifestation of the son of man you understand you remember eating and drinking we already went that everybody here so she got an oil before the son of man revealed let's go to Daniel chapter 12. that's why I keep asking you are you up with the sermon amen blessed be the name of the glory to God yes my sister I have somebody who can say Amen if you don't want to say Amen she even waved my hand God bless you amen Daniel 12 verse 7. if I have a church full of them I'm fine they don't have headache they need food and they start jumping easy life [Music] Daniel 12 7 if you dare you can say Amen and I heard the Man Clothing line and then your 12 is revelation 10. amen and when he had when he held up his right hand and left hand to Heaven revelation 10. and so by him that liveth forever Revelation 10 that it shall be for a time times and half what does that mean and when he shall have accomplished to scatter the power of the Holy people all these things shall be finished and I heard me Daniel but I understood so there is a hearing of word but there is an understanding of what you're hearing come back everybody here but when John heard the Thunders and understood the pandas everybody here I've heard but I understood not then say the eye oh my Lord Capital LOD so that person we know who is capital capital l-o-r-d oh my Lord what shall not be the end of these things amen and he said go your way Daniel this is not your time for the word our water [Music] that's why you cannot understand them everybody here and they are water until water [Music] everybody here if this world are closed up and seal until the time of the end when Paul came on the scene and Paul began to preach was that the end time do you expect Paul to understand that do you expect Luther to understand that do you expect Wesley to understand that [Music] everybody here hallelujah he said many shall be water so what was spoken there purifies as people [Music] it is not a sanctification of the holiness [Music] because they deviated and went to armenianism they miss it and brother Branham said there was still a mysterious part of it that Wesley didn't catch it everybody okay he says it shall be purified and made water so whoever understand this thing it will purify you these things that are still when you understand them they're gonna purify you do you see why even preacher attacked the seals blocking your purification what is supposed to make you white they are telling you that you don't have to preach those Mysteries how can you be white without the silver bringing denominational idea into the message everybody here they shall be purified and made water and do water that's why it's not letting you alone as soon as you hear it you begin to trouble until you surrender everybody the more stubborn you are the more powerful you make the message but here the more stubborn you are toward the message the more it becomes powerful until it will break you except if you are the seed of the serpent then it will let you go hey everybody Kia but the wicked shall do water so you hearing that and you continue to do wickedly did you hear me you are hearing those Mysteries but your life is not changing but here and none of the wicked shall water so even though the seals are broken if your origin is wrong you will never understand the field even if you eat them [Music] why is the spirit saying to him the heaven here which ear this one everybody okay glory to God but the water who's gonna the world shall do water who's gonna understand how many children did we have five water what made them wise [Music] those are the ones they're gonna understand [Applause] everybody here what makes them understand is the second Oiler amen [Music] Revelation 10 verse 1 the Bible say and I saw another Mighty Angel come down from glove with a cloud it's right there and a rainbow was upon his head and his face was as he were there and his water the problem we are dealing with since that Sunday is the feet they are not feet of brass but they are feet of pillars of water why are they Pillar of Fire amen and he had in his hand we know which hand you remember or the right hand he had in his hand a little book that is what he was closed before and he set his right foot upon water so it's not just feet of Pillar of Fire but the right one is upon the sea so there is a connection between the sea it is not in the sea anybody here because we know somebody who walk on the sea all right everybody here everybody here he could walk on the water but here so his foot is upon the sea and another foot is upon the Water why did this Angel make made sure that the two feet are in those two places and not the feet of brass there must be pillars of fire everybody okay and he headed his render a little book open and he set his right foot upon the sea and his left foot upon the Earth and he cried with a loud water us went around a lion roar if we went through this and when he cried what happened so they cry have seven tanners everybody here and when the seven Thunders had ordered the voice I was about to do water for you to write you must understand what you are healing amen and I heard the voice from Heaven saying unto me [Music] those things which the Thunder would eat water and do water so the seals everybody the seals hold everybody here they are written spoken [Music] Thunders in my heart I'm pulling that from the Bible not only done there's seven thunders of God everybody the only way for you to know what the Thunder spoken because the Thunder are not written anybody here so if you pick up this Baba and you begin to read the Bible you don't see Thunders that's it by the time they are there [Music] the Thunder are not in leather form the Thunder are in the Bible in a silver format everybody here so right here we can understand now that the Bible has a part that is written and the part that is Unwritten [Music] everybody here you know what is Unwritten the written part I have my Bible you have your Bible we can all verify how do we verify the unwritten partner [Music] my subject this morning is the four phases of roof the second oil and the Beast everybody okay the second oil and the Beast not the first one but the second oil and the Beast but here in our journey in the Tabernacle we are already in the hottest where roof is in the trashing form everybody here then on the Sunday that follow we found out that according to Jeremiah 32 verse 11 that when you purchase a field body caliber you got to bring you one when you purchase a field they give you the tattered anybody care they give you a title did and this title did according to Jeremiah have two parts everybody okay glory to God the Bible says so I took the evidence of the purchase the evidence of the purchase is another name for the tattered everything everybody care because it shows that he belongs to you you purchase something you got the title everybody because Jeremiah took money 17 shekels and gave it and they gave him the title everybody here but this evidence have two part the Bible said buff that which was according to the law in the custom and that which was so the doctor did in the scripture have a part that is open and a part that is sealed everybody cares so far the Bible continues again in Jeremiah that that saved the Lord of hosts the god of Israel take these evidences the reason why it's plural because it's two of them one is open one itself take these evidences buff which is Hill and this evidence if you notice they say take these evidences plural because it's true this evidence of purchase one everybody okay it is one but two part everybody okay buff which is sealed and this evidence which is open and put them in water what does it mean to put it in a vessel that is made out of Earth brother bottom says this in Gabriel's instruction he says we pick up the Scrolls how that this Crow was handed to his hand how that Jeremiah where we read in Jeremiah 32 verse 6 his cousin you remember that Sunday Hannah Neil was left with some hair and they were going into captivity which we are going into with him this morning captivity and he was kept in a freely vessel showing it shows where the power of God everybody okay and the scroll and the secret of God is known in the water so brother Branham saying when they took this evidence and they put it in the Earthly vessel it is showing that the way you understand the Tata did you understand the thought of deed of God in your heart amen it is made known in the heart but here our plane of redemption in the title did the same being kept in Earthly versus plural what is it Jesus name and the water so this revelation of the name of Jesus Christ must be made known in the heart not in the head Paul says this for God who commanded then lied to shine out of Darkness had shine in our everybody okay why to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ but we have this treasure everybody okay in Earthly vessel that's the Excellency of the power might be of God and none of us so the revelation of God is kept in the heart Paul continues here he says that the god of our Lord Jesus Christ the father of Glory may give unto you the spirit of water and water you understand now the spirit of wisdom and Revelation in the knowledge of water while that the eyes of water do you understand with your ears or you understand with your eyes how do we understand with our ears right but the Bible say you are understanding with the eyes how can and I understand anointed eyes everybody here the eye of your understanding be what that you may know when your eyes are open you understand by your heart opened the Eyes of My Heart everybody here so I can see you that you may know what is the hope of his calling and what is the riches of the glory of his inheritance in water so we understand brother Branham continues here he says Jeremiah said this girl must be kept as you read it here he shall say he must be kept in a free vessel see Oh What a Beautiful Things there it could be he could talk about it a while this scroll was kept in a Netflix vessel a vessel that once became glory and did water and did water and kept in every vessel until of water so who was the vessels that became flesh that died then rose again his name is who that's why in Revelation 1 1 there was a revelation of Jesus Christ that was never unfolded before [Music] open revelation everybody here Revelation chapter one verse one you dare you can say Amen the revelation of who which God gave to Adam after his resurrection there was still a revelation of Jesus Christ that was not me known to men but here because that Revelation was kept in a newly vessel he was left things which must shortly come to pass and his son and signify it by water to his servant who so when Jesus Christ died and rose again he heard the revelation everybody here because when they asked him about his coming he said I don't know I don't know about my coming that one only The Who the father knows about him the revelation of my coming so only giving to them but go back again to verse one the revelation of who which who gave him God who now the father gave him that revelation [Music] everybody okay I'm still climbing my friend everybody okay glory to God so what we are saying is we got two evidences one that is open one that is filled but both of them make one party what does he mean open evidence and seal evidence what does he mean go to the Book of Joshua because playing terms in the message is not good we are not in the hour of ignorance we gotta know what we are believing everybody here what does he mean by open evidence and close or seal evidence what does he mean what are you trying to say number one I'm not the one saying it's the scripture number two what does he mean you there Joshua chapter 4 verse 1. give me time I gotta clam this slowly and he came to pass when all the people were clean Passover in other words they cross they finish Crossing Jordan that the Lord spoke to Joshua God taught Israel to prepare they're going to Cross Jordan not the Red Sea they are Crossing Jordan with Joshua but here God opened the Jordan River everybody here the priests who are carrying the ark we went through this on the mystery of the same and the approach as soon as the feet everybody okay you remember the feet you remember where roof was sleeping but here as soon as the feet of the prince Touch the Water Jordan open up and the priest went and stood in the middle of Jordan somewhere why we okay keep your seatbelt I'm still climbing verse two God says take you how many men out of the people out of every tribe amen and command you them saying take you out of the midst of Jordan out of the place you're watching your scripture out of the place where the water everybody okay remember we're on the feet of pillars of Fire so when the priests were going to Jordan the priests were moving and they reached the middle of Jordan and they stop they didn't stop just like that come on because remember the four priests were the wheels of the Caribbean you remember the hotel they were killing Bianca amen and the axle of the Ark engage into the shoulder and the priest became the will that is moving the Earth everybody okay so when they were going the one that was on The Chariot stopped the probe he pushed the break everybody okay everybody okay when he pushed the bread The Chariot stop with the Ark of the Covenant and the feet ask those priests were standing somewhere and God said when you go to Jordan watch the feet of the priest not the head not the children look at the feet of the priest why feet you remember look at the feet watch where they are standing and do something what are you doing where the Feast of the priest stood Farm do water so the face when they were moving where they stopped there were piles of stone if you are building a bridge you want to put the foundation you must hit a rock when you read The Rock that's where you put the foundation that's where you put your foot everybody okay because that's a firm's surface praise God 12 stone and you shall carry them over with you and leave them in the lodging place where you shall Lodge this night so 12 people went inside of Jordan where is the priest the priest are standing there where are they right there they look the priests are standing on Stone they went and the first one pick up Stone out this Stone were in the middle of Jordan and they took 12 stone out brother Michael and they went with it outside and they put that one two three in trouble's order four five six and they made 12 stone we okay verse uh four then Joshua called the 12 men whom he had prepared they were already prepared of the children of Israel out of the tribe of men how many Stone did God told them to pick how many 12 did God give any other instruction to Joshua if you are standing with Joshua anybody here and Joshua and God was speaking to Joshua if we ask you a question what did God tell Joshua you will repeat the same thing God told Joshua take 12 men go in the middle take 12 stone out put it where you're gonna Lodge that's all you know watch what Joshua is doing verse 5 and Joshua said to them pass over before the Ark of the Lord your God into the midst of Jordan and take you up every man of you a stone upon his water do you see that on the shoulder let me skip it I'm trying to Quick quickly move according to the number of the tribe of the children of Israel that this may be a water [Music] so enjoy them they are pulling out of Jordan a sign a memorial a son or a memorial everybody okay that is coming out of Jordan God help me amen pick up uh verse six that boost may be a son among you that when your children ask their father in time to come saying what means you by the stone so this is put there in other words the stone have a message [Music] everybody understanding me so the stone that came out of Jordan out of Jordan has a message you're not the word that storm speaks about here and that message must be interpreted everybody okay what are the stone somebody must tell what happened what are the stone verse 7 then you shall answer them that the Waters of Jordan were cut off before the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord when he passed over Jordan the Waters of Jordan were cut off this message every Israelite have it but here God put the sign put the message and gave the interpretation of the message but here so if you ask brother Kalima you ask brother Kelly you ask Brother David they all have one message about the storm [Music] everybody okay verse 8. and the children of Israel did as Joshua commended and took up how many 12 how many son 12 stone out of the midst of Jordan as the Lord spoke to Joshua according to the numbers the number of the tribe of the children of Israel and carried them over with them to the place where they launched and laid them down there everybody okay watch now verse 9. you ready you ready and Joshua set up 12 Stones in the midst of water who told Joshua to do that [Music] I'm asking you a question God said take 12 stone outside of Jordan and put them there that's all what God Said but when Joshua heard God amen you follow me Joshua took 12 stone put it up and went in that same spot and put 1200 Stone who told Joshua to put 12 stone so now we have 12 stone outside of Jordan everybody okay everybody okay everybody okay everybody good we okay now and we got trips done inside of Jordan we okay we okay let's continue okay let's continue and John verse 9 and Joshua set up 12 stone in the midst of Jordan in the place where the water [Music] everybody okay stop if they ask you what are the Sun you said that what does he mean oh it means that when we were coming God opened the John and Weaver and we go second question why did you get the stone he was in the midst of Jordan okay where is the location you are lost you are lost you don't know the location everybody here you don't know the location so somebody must put a reference you follow me off the location where the open storm were taken anybody okay I can go quickly I'm going slowly so I can grant you in the scripture everybody okay verse 9 and Joshua set up 12 stone in the midst of Jordan where in the place where the water in the location where the feet stood where the the defeat of the priesthood which brought the Ark of the Covenant Stone there are there till this water when they finish God said to have stone God never said 24 Stone but here Joshua took 12 stone outside everybody okay and he took 12 stone inside everybody okay when they finish do you follow me when they left Jordan when the priests went out the water covered if you look in Jordan like this you don't see it everybody okay now the Sun everybody okay oh the memorial of Jordan are two memorials there is an open Memorial that everybody can see even the enemies of Israel they can notice that but there is another Memorial that has been closed our seal remember what is the evidence that you cross Jordan come I'm gonna show you where outside of Jordan there is an open evidence ever here but there is also a civil evidence God never spoke to Joshua that using word Joshua caught it in a different language [Music] are you okay are you following me jump to verse 19. glory to God verse 19 and the people came out of Jordan on the 10th day let's leave it alone after the first month let's leave it alone and in Cape where [Music] can you can you preach with me and in Camp where in the east border of water so the place that this evidence was placed is at gilga all closer to Jericho the scripture everything remember the court written in the scripture is written for a reason everybody okay now these two evidences have a problem everybody here the storm on the outside can be manipulated [Music] do you follow me do you follow me anybody can come and pick up the stone and look and change the order of the Stone everybody here maybe when they put the stone the stone was looking East somebody can come pick up the stone and turn them and make them West everybody okay everybody okay the open evidence is subject to man manipulation [Music] hey but here everybody can give their own interpretation of the order of the Stone [Music] everybody here this is three sharp is here if this is the order Joshua plays if somebody comes and put this it's still three but is this the other Joshua Place how do you know it's not the other [Music] if somebody does this is this the order of Joshua how do you know it's not the other you must have a reference everybody okay you must have a reference that when the stone are trouble go back and look at the reference everybody okay and say this Stone goes here oh because here this Stone goes here everybody okay everybody okay the Silverstone cannot be tempered by men everybody here nobody can touch the stone everybody okay everybody okay so who can tell us where your stones are everybody okay everybody okay because Joshua is dead everybody that came out of Egypt is dead they are dead everybody here we are slept with an open evidence where everybody even the Philistine can come and push a stone down and go so the stone is not originally the way it is in other words they open evidence it's subject to destruction it is subject to dislocation it is subject to misplacement [Music] everybody the one we're gonna Trust must be able to do two things but here he must have the ability to repair the altar [Applause] everybody okay and he must also have the ability to open the Jordan and let us see the sun foreign [Music] the repairing of the stone everybody can do it everybody can claim to do it but the Father the father Vindication that you truly know about the sun you must go in the water and open the stone to us if you repair but you don't open the seal evidence you are not the one that we can trust foreign [Music] did I lose you Hallelujah the Bible says this in first king chapter 11. that Elijah said to all the people come here unto me and all the people came near unto him and he did water [Applause] [Music] everybody okay so if you travel the storm the anointing of Elijah yes have a way to pick up the stone and to repair the storm [Music] [Applause] [Music] hey everybody okay everybody okay glory to God everybody okay everybody okay and how many Stone did he you he repaired the altar of the Lord there was water and Elijah took how many Stone how many songs how many Stone was taken out of Jordan how many Stone were left inside how many storm Elijah report I love this church everybody okay and then and then according to the number of the tribe of water and to whom the word of the Lord came and said shall be a water so we found an anointing in the Bible that when the altar is broken down when the sun are misplaced that anointing [Applause] can come and look at the Sun and say this Stone goes here and God's here the stone got here it's time because here this storm goes here [Applause] glory to God [Music] hallelujah hallelujah now we got a question how do you know the order of the Stone Aja how do you do you let me remind you something brother Branham say the messenger of this time will do two things you remember I saw the court many times number one he will do water thank you turn the heart [Music] of water of the children to the water everybody Kia everybody here and number two he will do water reveal water the water The Mystery of the water say it louder listen I don't have a pastor over me only Jesus Christ I am independent so I can preach what I want when I was under a pastor I have to respect his office but now I'm sovereign [Applause] then Jesus Christ because why the problem is the pastor of the age and Jesus Christ is the pastor of the brother because he is the great shepherd man the Lord is my shepherd everybody okay everybody okay revealed The Mystery of the water seven Thunders which are the Revelation contained under the seven [Music] okay everybody okay so number one Elijah can turn the water of the water to the water let's open first king now I'm preaching something different [Music] Lord help me open first king chapter 18. glory to God [Music] glory to God when Elijah repaired the altar anybody here job to verse job to verse 37. you there you there hear me oh Lord hear me that these people may know that you are the what and that you have done what can you read it with me can

repairing of the stone turn Israel back to God [Music] everybody here but now that's the number one everybody okay but number two one you can repair the stone that are outside that are open you can put them back in place but number two you must open something that was but here this Stone was sealed where in which river [Music] go to second king go to second king chapter two now we found out that the anointing of Elijah can repair a broken stones but what shows us what a Vindication we can tell that you know the order for us to know you must open Jordan [Music] everybody okay everybody okay for us to know that you can repair you must be alsoever to open Jordan and to show us what is in Jordan let's go back to the Bible we are going back to the Bible we are going back to the Bible with the message of Malachi so [Music] everybody [Applause] let's go let's go to second king second king chapter two if you dare you can say Amen Lord this is one third of what I'm trying to get my goodness you there verse 2 chapter 2 verse 1. and he can't stop where was The Landmark that the scripture gave us about the position of that spot it was well and what good I love this church let's go and he came to pass when the Lord will do what when the rapture of a larger approaches when the rapture Elijah was raptured when the Rapture of a larger approaches Elijah was in which place and he came to pass [Music] [Applause] [Music] when the Lord will take up who Into Water by water that Elijah went with Elisha from what [Music] from which person everybody okay gilga check where's Jericho and Elijah said to Elijah till we hear I pray you for the Lord has sent me to water we don't see better there it must be in the east border of water Jericho let's continue and the Lord shall say to him as the Lord delivereth he already started with gilgore which is the anointing is activated everybody here but we have to progress everybody here as their soul liveth I will not leave you so they went down to better so Elisha is is not living a larger brother random is calling this step justification sanctification the Tabernacle the Tabernacle the tabernacle into the holiest everybody okay and the sons of the Prophet verse 3 that were in better came forth to Elisha and said to him know you that the Lord will take away your master from your head today he said yeah I know I know it hold your peace continue with your Mavericks stuff and your elevation churches and your TD Jakes [Music] for the Lord has sent me to [Music] everybody here to who but Jericho he must be on the east border but here now we got gilga is now center with Jericho everybody okay he sent him to Jericho and say as the Lord leaving verse 4 and as your soul will leave us I will not leave you so they went to Jericho and the sons of the Prophet that were hurt they are in the city of Jericho but the Jordan is not in the city you must come out a little bit on the east border then you're gonna find Jordan you see the position you see the landmark why was Elijah walking that way where is he heading what has Elijah why is Elijah following the GPS [Music] are here the scripture this message it makes the Bible yummy everybody okay and then the son of the Prophet verse 5 that were a Jericho came to Elijah and said to him no you know that the Lord will take away your master from your head to the day and he say yeah I know hold your peace amen what an Elijah said to him Terry I pray you here for the Lord had sent me to what so now he's living Jericho toward s while that direction everybody okay to Jordan and he said as the Lord liveth as your soul liveth I will not leave you so day two went and 50 men of the sons of the Prophet went and stood to view a fire off they're afraid of the message [Music] they don't want to quote the message don't quote the message we are watching the message from a pharaoh they don't want to handle the message everybody okay you're gonna find a specie here you call people message we leave a message believer this is not the time to pray again we must be open we must pull our Cannon open either you believe you believe it or you don't believe it [Music] yeah yeah and then 50 men of the sons of the Prophet went verse 7 and stood the pharah and dates too stood by water so they approaches Jordan they're coming from Jericho what do you think is under the water [Music] they didn't go any car they didn't cross the Jordan in any direction no they made sure they're coming from Jericho and they land Jericho with gilga because there is something in the water nobody opened that before since Joshua up to now nobody opened that everybody was only talking about the open Stone everybody was preaching about the open Stone everybody was prophesying about the open Sun by this time no more the open Stone this time we must open the Jordan we must go in the Jordan we must see the evidence that was sealed glory to God you ready and Elijah took his water his ministry remember when Samuel came the witch offenders say I see an old man with his his ministry is still there the prophet robe about here that's why when he left he took the mentor and left it to Elijah because Elijah must continue Revelation 10 8 must continue after seven [Applause] but here you cannot go with the ministry the one staying behind that's why I say you can kill the messenger but you cannot kill the message [Music] me of the sin but the mentor can go back but here and Elijah took his water everybody here and he wrap it together everybody here and he smoked the waters [Music] Jordan means what means what death death means water so the water of Jordan at the water off [Music] the go listen to the sermon the water of Separation everybody here so he's smart the word of Jordan and they were divided how [Music] after Joshua the first one that struck this water and open it it's then anointing of Elijah so Elijah can do two things Elijah can turn the heart of the children to the father by repairing the storm Elijah also can part the water to reveal the mystery that was sealed all these years under there and it's those Mysteries that literally that is the true Vindication [Music] repairing the altar is a Vindication but opening Jordan is more than a vindication [Applause] [Music] that's why the opening is literally true that's what will turn the heart of the children back glory to God he divided the water here and there and they too went over in water what do you think Elijah saw in the middle what do you think it how many form did he see he said Elijah look look Elijah get there he say this is my only opportunity now I can touch the stone that Joshua stood nobody in Israel touch the storm only Elisha he looked he say wow so this stone is here this is here this is here wow glory to God this is so good Elijah say let's keep going let's keep going he said no no no let me take a picture I'm gonna put on Facebook [Music] [Applause] [Music] everybody here let me put a picture I'm gonna send it to my friend so what we heard before he was the truth now my eyes helps him thank you that it's not a fable in the midst of Jordan where did they pursued here let me stand too let me feel like the priest everybody okay what's the what's the meat that what that filled evidence and they came out the Rapture are open up [Music] of Jordan Jesus let me skip over here verse verse 9 and he came to pass when they were gone over that Elijah said to Elisha ask after Jonah after he has sinned something that nobody seen they only heard and everybody could speculate throughout the ages The Seventh-Day Adventist School Adventure LA Kings could Adventure [Music] all your people that you think brother brand I'm copy for they were only speculating [Music] everybody here ask what I shall do for you before I be taken for you I pray you let water [Music] did you get it Elijah had the anointing of Elijah has already a measure anybody here that was the first measure [Music] anybody here and answer me did the second measure foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] of your spirit upon me and he said you have asked her heart thing anybody here drop down to verse 13 so I can move forward and he took up also the mentor of Elijah that fell from him and went back and stood by the bank of water [Music] but here Elijah saw the sealed evidence when he came back he didn't deviate that evidence do you follow me do you follow me he never went again to the open evidence he went back again and lined himself up again in the same evidence with the second [Music] everybody okay everybody okay and he took the Manta not his mentor it's a continuation of the ministry of Elijah but no more upon Elijah but upon the bride everybody okay everybody okay so you in the bread you must make sure Elijah Elijah is holding the mentor everybody okay watch the way stop when Elijah hit the water of of Jordan did he say anything did he spoke anything he just hit the water and go but Elisha must say something foreign [Music] not his mentor I don't have another Ministry [Music] that's why my job is easy foreign [Applause] Ministry I already have a robe [Applause] everybody here I'm on my way to Cayman Lane amen watch this Oh Glory to God verse 14. he took the mantle of Elijah that fell on him and did water and do what what did he say where is my God [Music] where is water you cannot smooth the river the second time we were cutting Elijah [Applause] [Music] ever here [Music] but when we are preaching the Bible we must quote we must cook we must say the god of brother Branham [Applause] everybody okay that's why we could brother Branham when we are smiting the water of the word it is with the god of God Ibraham the message say brother Branham say brother Branham saying [Music] that's why we are preaching the word with the god of Elijah with the mantle of Elijah that's why we said the Bible said brother Branham say when we call on the god of Elijah this Bible open up again [Applause] [Music] and you can see now what brother Branham was really saying because when you open up we review again the seal evidence inside of Jordan they tattered The Edge two-party the open evidence and the seal evidence the open evidence and the sea level but it's the same evidence that Vindicated the open of this any question [Music] stuff everybody okay everybody okay oh my God everybody okay so we can see here that the Bible also is written in a written form an air [Music] the written form is this everybody has it it is your openness heaviness and because he was open how many version of the Bible do you have [Music] New International Version do the disease version this version this version this version why the manipulation of a man because it was an open [Music] Meet The Seer the awakened word [Applause] [Music] anybody here brother Branham say it is my belief I believe that the Bible has every answer for every age you're already what yeah everybody can interpret the way they want everybody here for the believer of that age I believe that everything that we have need of is written right here just need to be interpreted by the I don't believe that any man on the Earth has a right to put his own but what happened why because he was open but in Revelation 5 the Bible said I saw in the right hand you remember that of him that sat upon the throne and what written where written where Within the riding was waiting sad and on there filled with water so the Bible now have two parts everybody here there is a written part and there is a seal part or a raping part Hallelujah there is writing on the inside of the book but the back side had sevens here on the back of it that was that was not written in there the Bible have two evidences the written portion and the written portion the title did have two evidence they open evidence and they see loving them they open everybody can play with him everybody can erase it everybody can do what they want to do the son of Jordan have two evidences they open evidence and there she live with us glory to God he says now remember it was not written in the book and in the days of the voice of the seven angels all this mystery that is written within should be what it should be taken care of in that day them is the time for the seven voices of Revelation what to be water when this book is finished there is only one thing left that is the seven mysterious voices of water [Music] that was wrought on there that John was water so you can preach the Babylon you want and why why not Vindication is for you to open what was sealed if you open what was sealed we will believe everything that you preach to us from the open evidence [Music] did you get it did you get it this brings us to the vision of Junior Jackson yes amen brother Branham says that Gino Jackson told me a dream that there was a long great grassy Hill and the water had washed all the soul off the top and it becomes Rock like a ball top of the mountain says that in the vision of Junior Jackson saw a hill but on the top here there was some water that came and that water washed the top of it until he made the top like a boulder anybody here everything here is Grassy but over here is Rock everybody okay praise God and again in this rock there were family ridings but here so brother Branham said when the water was coming I have another coat the water was cutting certain ridings on the rock so they were rewardings right here on the outside of the Rock and they were cut by the water which is the spirit of God here you must be born of the water except a man be born of the water but here and then they were funny riding and said that I was standing there with all the Brethren around the church here interpreting this water this rock was already open he was open to the public but here and he was open and the scripture that was on it was opened to the public and everybody can interpret this and by the Branham was also interpreting everybody okay and then when it comes to the time that I got all of it I finish everything interpreted then somehow or another if I understand the dream around I got a hold of something like a water do you know what a crowbar is when you put a nail into a into a wood and you're trying to kill by Amina to remove the nail there is something that looked like a hook like this that you put the nail inside of it and you pull it like this that's a crowbar is a crowbar Sharp can they call back at something and something like a crowbar something kind of an angle about something not angle bar means a pry bar on something and just do what so if brother Branham took something and cut the rock can a crowbar cataract what can cut something as you remember in Sabino Canyon but here when brother Branham was playing with his hand out something dropped down and shut his hand what shook his hand [Music] [Applause] but he was not a sword that was shift it was a stone that was open foreign [Applause] [Music] this is an unseal evidence [Music] and here [Applause] and look good glistering [Music] took the sword and cut the mountain that was the secret I was hiding sunshine ever here ever here and then when I cut the top of it and I did water brother when he cut it he took the top and lifted up everybody here when he lifts it up and on the inside why is the vision of brother I I gave you through the scripture Jeremiah opened close open close open close now the vision of brother Brandon matches the Bible come on now yeah everybody here and then on the inside there was a water so when brother brought them cut this off this stop open up everybody here on the inside here there was another rock here that was never seen before he was seal in the rock so that rock have two parts there was an open part and there was a sealed party [Music] this mystery will purify you it will make you white everybody okay and then on the inside there was a White Rock something on the order of a water remember in the pyramid in the king's chamber there was granite you remember that in a hotel hey but here there was something on that side something White Rock that was what this was written but this was a written I don't know what I would call this sermon because I have not touched the Beast not even the surface everybody okay the interpretation on the rock the rock is who that was in the brother's dream and that is there anybody can open it all kind of version King James whatever no International Version Jehovah Witnesses everybody and for all these these years the Bible has been open evidence subject to men manipulation until we have absolutely give it the water interpretation because it's open anybody can do what they want to do anybody can claim what they want to claim and but here and their last gift being added it's a last gift which is the seven angels time to preach in the loud decent church at that time there will be a lot of things that was the stone were played with down through there everybody okay what happened six months before it happened we told you by the holy spirit because the pyramid riding on there right there as the brother had the dream and I interpreted to you that is the entire interpretation now all the mysteries of justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost was done foreign of that which was in there not the seven churches the servants you revealed their mystery then he opened this thing up at the top and found her white bar head never he was there what are you talking about brother brother remember he was in a pyramid where the mysterious White Rock was not written on and the angel took me into the Pyramid of so when the engine came they pick up brother Branham and they put him inside his inside the Angelic pyramid when brother brother met him he saw what is going on now he can interpret what was in the dreamer the mystery of God known only to the seven angels damn word the message was the messenger they had come to interpret the appearance or the message of the secret of the seven seal which is laying with inside the water what are you talking about body Stephen I took some kind of a bar we know what it is and cut it off and on the inside was the White Rock that had nothing wrote on and I told the brother I said don't go west stay here and look on this Tila water when brother Branham looked at that it was something that was not written before he stopped he had to go west why did he go west he said I went West for the what is a blessed and Thunder and return back to the east with the interpreting this water [Music] so the servant seal opened the Thunders and the Thunders is the interpretation of the word that was never written yet it's inside the Bible so through the Thunders now when you look in the Bible the Bible become a new [Music] about here check somebody's hand and say God bless you [Music] let's see where I can get father Feel Jesus Christ not my fault your fault dog everybody okay Lord help me I have to rush quickly and cut it off when we talk about this oil and the Virgin and the second oil so now you are grounded in this church about the seals about the thunder about the open evidence about the seals evidence now you understand in this church about here the 10th virgin took the water they took lamps everybody okay Lord help me I'm trying to hurry now they took their lamps and when they took their lamps are going to meet the bridegroom you already understood this is going to meet boys everybody okay and then when they went their wives took off what made them wise is the oil that they took everybody here all of them have lamp daldo's lamp had oil but when the bridegroom came the oil of that lamp will run out and the lamp were going out because the Bible says that at midnight there was a cry which is a shout which is a message of seven thunders of Seven Seals behold the bread groom cometh go here to meet him and all the Virgin arose and they trimmed their lamb and the foolish said unto them as give us of your for our lamp our water the lamps of everybody was going out but the wives were not trouble because of the second one [Music] everybody okay the second oil is the noise that you cannot share [Music] let me help you again when the foolish ask the wise it's written on your Bible give us of your oil they said no no no no no if we give it to you we're gonna run out you need to go find it yourself so it's an individual oil you receive it individually about here everybody here make sure the one sitting beside you have their own because you might be in the same message but you are talking two different messages [Music] but you are talking different message am I preaching the message like Pentecostal some are preaching the message like Baptist [Music] Presbyterian go to the Baptist Church you come in the message by Church you feel the same spirit [Music] because of lack of the second oil everybody here ever here that oil causes separation you don't cause the separation the lack of oil will make one go out and you are going to stay [Music] but here to make somebody go out trying to find oil and you are staying everybody here and that oil you need it to meet the bridegroom everybody here that always doesn't stop there you make you enter into the bread with the bridegroom in the chamber and close the door good morning let me help you my friend I know when I'm getting this territory to you the Bible saying why they want to buy it was not the tribulation yet the tribulation came when they came back and they begin to knock Lord open he said I will open that was the tribulation the population came at that time when they went in it's the marriage the Bible said the bridegroom came and they that were what makes them ready the secondary so it's an all that make you ready to meet the bridegroom without that law you my friend everybody here went in with him to the water so it's the oil of marriage the fish oil the Virgin were only engaged remember the first all engages you to the husband but he doesn't put you in marriage but here the second oil is the oil that puts you into a marriage remember Adam was married but he didn't consume his marriage and the serpenter [Music] everybody okay everybody okay everybody okay so now God had to make sure that this bride let's go slowly let's go slowly so when the bridegroom came he gets juicy when my tummy is up he said when Brad gone came and they were ready they die already went in to the water it's an oil of marriage it's an oil that puts you in marriage look at that marriage they went into the marriage Ender was water everybody here when you enter there with the bridegroom whatever happened there it's not to the public [Music] everybody okay whatever happened in the holiest it's not to the public here you are you are united say Noel that unites you with the husband it's annoying that bring an invisible Union of the Heavenly bride and yeah that's the all you need everybody here then whatever when you spend time too with your husband later on the tribulation will kick it [Music] now we found out that the vessels have oil The Vessel have oil but we're talking about the soil but according to Paul Paul says that the wisdom because that oil made the Virgin being wise and the wisdom of God is Christ we found it last week the Bible said Christ the wisdom of God so that oil is Christ but walk under Trust [Music] say this is stumble people in the message we must be precise [Music] lack of precision you operate you cutting nerves and everything and pipes and then you finish your operation and the person can move the leg anymore because you don't know your surgery you need to learn Anatomy to know when you're cutting not to cut the bread to amputate to the brother you see broad going on like this in the message because somebody chopped the Thunder these are the one Chopper the the the seals beside the one chop the Mysteries beside the one chop the son of man the chapel can until summer on the wheelchair they are proud but thank God for the tent vision when they bring you on when you push you on the wheelchair when you come on the outside you are pushing the wheelchair [Laughter] [Applause] Hallelujah when you come out of the door [Music] when you come out from the third Vision the wheelchair doesn't push you you are the one pushing the wheelchair what happened I don't know brother you used to be with us I don't know what happened there my friend I don't know I have to follow him on streaming every time [Music] everybody okay everybody okay Christ The Mystery of God Christ the wisdom of God heal his Redemption Paul says that we speak the mystery of God which is Christ with uh the wisdom of God which is Christ in the water so this oil is the oil of crust not just crust but Christ preach in mystery Christ preach according to the seal evidence of Jordan no more crusted sealed with the stone that people play Run Christ preach in mystery what kind of mysteries now Paul said even the water so this wisdom must be hidden it must be a sealed wisdom a wisdom that was not used before and knowingly that was never used before and evidence that was never opened before a word that was never written before I'm giving you all those languages so when you read brother Branham you you it's easy everybody okay a mystery that was hidden in other words they seal evidence but here which God ordained before water [Music] and to our so that mystery is For Your Glory [Music] so when somebody's stopping you from the opening of the seal they are blocking your glory oh my God everybody okay let me try to rush everybody okay when you look at the candlestick you tired somebody's saying a little bit so I gotta give you to the airport everybody okay he said according to this true picture that's the candlestick if you watch the first lamp that every virgin was carrying have three parts yes yes that's right yes everybody okay he has a reservoir you have a stick a spout and then on the top you have everybody here right there you got it everybody here if you look at the Candlestick the Candlestick is called lampstem that's the correct way what about them say it's called Lamp and the Virgin have lamb the difference between this and this is the Candlestick is a combination of seven lamps yeah seven individual lamps put together they give you one candle so every lamp of the Candlestick also have three parts you have the boil the reservoir he has the and then you have the everybody here the flame right on the top there everybody here so this light and this light is the same what are you trying to say what the problem says reminding you that this light never went out the priests just keep water the one that was pulling all was not the prophet he was a priest because Jesus have treated us he is son of God which means what he's son of man which means what and he's son of David which is water but here Son of God Son of Man son of David everybody okay everybody okay now this oil was powered by the priest so it was the office of the Son of God that was giving oil throughout the seven churches Jesus was Son of God giving oil he was son of man when he came on Earth and he died for our sin he was son of man he said the son of man the son of man the son of man but when he left and he came on the day of Pentecost he was not son of man he was the son of God empowering oil throughout the seven churches [Music] everybody okay everybody okay now when a priest poor all there is a danger foreign Lord help me in the book of Samuel we found out that the child Samuel Minister unto the Lord before who Samuel was not a priest everybody okay Samuel was not from the tribe of liver he came from the tribe of Ephraim his mother made the vow that God I am bearing if you give me a child I will give it to your service so Samia went not being a priest but he was put under the priest's office and he began to work in the Tabernacle as a priest but he was not a priest he was a prophet so the interests of Samuel into the Tabernacle he entered as a priest as delivered even though he was not delivered the lamp of the Lord was on yes amen everybody okay and Samuel was just delivered and something happened to ELA to the priest and the word of the Lord was water precious means he was well he was rare in those days why because there was no the Bible didn't say there was no vision you remember we preached on the two vision and the dream and open vision is a vision that you see with your eyes open did you get me a close vision is the vision that you see when you go to sleep and it happened that's why brother Branham said a dream that happened or a dream that is interpreted is a vision amen but a prophet doesn't go to sleep to see the vision I already taught you that here a prophet look at you and while he's talking to you he already that's why bellam said the one who sees with his eyes open amen so when they say there is no open Vision it means that there was no prophet but Samuel was already there but Samuel prophetic office was quiet because Ila's eyes are open everybody okay the Son of God is still working there's no way the son of man can kick in everybody okay and he came to pass at that time when Ela was laid down in his place and his eyes begin to utter and he could not water something happened to the vision of the priest liver Ela went blind naturally but spiritually something happened in the Tabernacle what happened in the Tabernacle when Iraq became blind and air the lamb of who when water but here so when the vision of the Son of God goes out the ministry is finished but here the Candlestick went out the lamp of the Virgin is going out you need another order no more in oil of the priest amen as soon as the lamp of God went out in the the temple showing that it was the end of the Leviticus delivered the priest ended God activated the prophetic gift of Samuel are we okay and then where the Ark of God was and Samuel laid down to water that that the Lord called who he never called him until the lamp went off [Music] the prophet was calling the sin what are you talking about my friend the Bible said all Israel from them to Bathsheba knew that Samuel was established to be a act 13 He gave unto them judges about this place of 450 until Samuel death so when the Candlestick went out but here the son of man the prophetic office open up everybody here but Samuel started first under the priest brother Branham have to start his ministry and yes under the Candlestick he have to go to the Pentecostal you have to go to the Full Gospel you have to work with the Full Gospel the Presbyterian he must be under the Candlestick until their land he's gone out then the prophetic office of brother Branham kick on glory to God where am I at e Hallelujah where am I at amen brother Branham says this that this bowl here Jesus help me he said the resource that the man ball because that they had whipped deep into it each age messenger is depicted here his life is on fire with the Holy Ghost he's weak his life has been immersed in so we see a crust here but the crust that is in a Candlestick it is the son of God there is another Christ who is the son of man anybody here because the Bible says in the day that the son of man will be not the Son of God in between the Son of God and the son of David the son of man God must reveal himself as a prophet we found out that this candlestick we're in the shape of an ark but they never made the circle everybody okay what is going on this is where we got this I got stopped somewhere Amen Let me push to a button and stop Paul says that now you understand because Daniel say nobody will open these evidences that was here until so Paul must preach a portion amen Paul can preach only apart Paul can never touch the sea levels because it's for the enter but here and then we prophesy in but that which is what he means perfect amen perfect means complete foreign I gotta stop here you needed to go to home what does complete means Paul said when that which is perfect is come then that which is in shall be water what does he mean why stop let me handle this here Paul said are preaching water what Paul preached was a bad why when that which is perfect come we take what Paul preach away was in part away doesn't mean what you're thinking [Music] can I say it again taking away what was in part according to us what the way we're seeing is we have the part that which is complete is coming we do this that's what you think it's not that way anybody here what do you see here what do you see here everybody Kia half a circle everybody here this is complete it is perfect everybody here this is half everybody here everybody here when the complete come you gotta the part is removed it is now really thrown away because the complete contain the part [Applause] [Music] everybody okay did you get me or you want me to repeat raise your hand if you want me to repeat it thank you listen to me carefully this is half amen this half the problem with it is because it's missing this [Music] hey but here this is the missing part because it's now written everybody okay but when the complete come the complete truly means this [Music] complete bring you that which is already was there and they missed part together that's why Paul said when the complete come we don't need the half anymore because the complete contained the house [Music] foreign did I lose you is that the word when the message of brother Branham comes you cannot read Martin Luther you cannot read John Wesley anymore Wesley is in the message Martin Luther is in the message Paul is in the message and when you season the message and what they didn't see is also in the message so the message got everything [Applause] did you hear it did you eat so the message when you have it the message have looter and Luther corrected he have Wesley and Wesley corrected he have power and what Paul means he have varenuous and the correction in foreign use that's why when brother Branham come he will recognize Billy Graham he will recognize her and Robin he said they are servant of God Campbell was the Servants of God Knox was a servant of God the Pentecostal yes over there he pulled them all up and he put it together so when we had that which is completed that which was important because those parts have mistake they had to lose end so you can no more go to those books and begin to read them because that which is complete this camera [Music] if a Lutheran come in this church he will see me talking about his messenger I don't need to go to his church his messenger is in my message Wesley is in my message Pentecostal are here I don't go to Pentecostal churches but when I read the message I see the deviation of the Pentecostal I see the Jehovah Witnesses I see the error I see everything without being in Jehovah Witness church so when I talked to a Jehovah Witness he will think that I have been reading the books that's right but I never read their books I only read the message because when that which is perfect have come everybody here you don't need the complete you don't need the part anymore because the Perfection bring what was before and corrected the missing part that was before in other words the Perfection brings the open evidence and they close evidence and put both of those emptied this together [Music] I don't know what to call this maybe I need to call this roof the open and close evidence because I can't touch the Beast we gotta stop here amen there's two evidences in the world the written word and the unwritten word the Jordan have two evidences the the stone of Junior Jackson two evidences the Bible two evidences amen and Paul say we preach in part because the other part was still but when that which is complete that which is complete when it comes he pick up what thought that's why you heard brother Branham say I preach like he have to take what Paul preached but he went further than Paul because Paul preaching partner that was the first time he went into the other side but after the opening of the seals brother Branham says certain things differently and I'm gonna stop here oh Christian what opportunity we have we have opportunities that never everybody okay we have opportunity that even and who and all of them the opportunity we have after the opening of death because we got the same part [Music] it's listening [Applause] now we don't go any more further and if you notice when brother Branham identified who we preach like he went straight to Paul he didn't say I preach like Luther he said I preach like who because Paul is in the scripture Paul is in the Bible and he just went back and put his reference back in the Bible and he closes everything in be there in the middle was coping from Paul anybody here that's why when we get our head in this message you don't have to listen to the nominations because when you open your ears you are opening the ears to something that have little truth with error load of Truth with error when you read any kind of books all the time when preachers in this message read other preachers in denominational they're opening their mind to order error Pharaoh Arrow Arrow no there is nothing that's a Christian book what is in that Christian book do you know how to detect the error and where there is no error before you know it you're gonna go suck up certain things that will confuse you with the message because the pastor was reading all kind of books Let's go to Billy Graham Library I won't take you there blue that message is already gone because the more we take people the people look you say whoa that was a great man how could he be an arrow you confuse the people [Music] you want me to make you a visit let me make you a visit in a message I don't want to take you even to Jeffersonville I have the word you want to visit sit with me at home and say open your bubble look here look here look where brother Brandon says here Look Away look here look here if you come out from there you will be speaking in tongue amen are you gonna come up there learning a lot then going to visit tell us born going to the no no no no when that which is perfect is come we are done away with dirty which is put your head in the message it's Vindicated because the message opened the seal evidence and the open evidence and he put both of them together and gave it to us this message is perfectly in line with the scripture let's pray Heavenly Father Lord we are approaching you humbly father again this afternoon thanking you for your grace your love and your mercy father and for everything you have been doing for us father you the one that guided this sermon he was Lord to be going into the trail of the serpent but father you know who was in need to get more stabilization to understand the message the way it was supposed to be understood that that's why we preached the Bible and we preach the Bible with the light of the message because now we got the open evidence and we got the seal evidence and the silverness came by this message Father Lord may you help us Lord to give allegiance to the lender to the revealed word of this hour that came in and to uphold that candle Lord take it away from The Bushel so that he can produce light because that's the second oil the oil that can prepare us the oil that make us ready the oil that unfolded the mystery the oil that Lord the Vindicated literally bring us back again to meet our bridegroom father I thank you for the sacrifice that the people have done father to go extra mile and let me reach this point Lord you know why you wanted me to go this direction and father we commit all the glory unto thee father may you protect your children and may the Holy Spirit continue to minister to them and unfold your word more and more because the more we're moving the clearer we can see without a doubt that Lord father we are a blessed chosen people not because we were worthy not because we deserve anything but it was by grace that you have chosen us before the foundation of the world father bless your children and remember their need Lord as we commit them unto their hand in the name of Jesus Christ amen God bless you church we love you [Applause] amen [Music] [Applause] amen amen [Music] let's sing it again everybody's singing [Music] amen amen [Music] all right amen [Music] amen y'all are dismissed we're gonna sing it again hallelujah [Music] amen amen amen [Music] amen well do you love him singing [Applause] will you serve him and singing do you believe in it amen amen well the Bible's true [Music] I believe in singing It's the word of goddess amen [Music]
