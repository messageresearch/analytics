[40:45] brother brandham says this in question
[40:47] and answer in 1964 which is after the
[40:50] seals uh that was preached in August the
[40:53] 30th in the morning paragraph 1 182 it's
[40:57] a long paragraph so I have to take what
[41:00] was necessary to kind of fill it into
[41:03] the into my slide brother brandham say
[41:05] that he was a man and a what a woman
[41:10] standing before what the alter holding
[41:13] one another's hand say I take you dear
[41:17] to be my loveful weed wife see she said
[41:21] I take you dear to be my lawful weighted
[41:24] husband why he said this is strange so
[41:28] there were a couple there renewing their
[41:30] vow but the preacher was not there they
[41:32] say this Pentecost he said this man and
[41:35] woman are getting married without a
[41:38] preacher and so he just uh so he just
[41:41] sat down and waited and after they made
[41:44] their what to live true to one another
[41:48] only death will separate them they put
[41:51] what their arms around one another and
[41:54] they did what kissed each other that's
[41:56] brother BR I'm saying
[41:59] that can you say
[42:01] Amen they were renewing The Vow when the
[42:04] Finish renewing The Vow they did
[42:06] what who say that the
[42:10] prophet can you say Amen they kiss each
[42:14] other somebody's ambushed to brother
[42:17] Kelly they kiss each other they turn
[42:19] around and walk out doing what smiling
[42:22] so you're going to experience that for
[42:24] the first time in spoken word right
[42:27] amen he says just a moment he said I'm
[42:30] kind of curious I'm a stranger say you
[42:33] are getting married say yes without a
[42:36] preacher he says what no say we've been
[42:40] married how many years 40
[42:44] years and the one who's going to get
[42:46] their vow renewed today has been married
[42:49] for 40 years
[42:55] am
[42:57] blessed be the name of the Lord so the
[42:59] coat fit perfectly they say that we've
[43:02] been married 40 years he said we got
[43:05] married right here at this altar how
[43:07] many years 40 years ago and every year
[43:10] we come back and do what renew our vow

[43:14] of idea a good idea so renewing a vow is

[49:04] Tabernacle we welcome you to this
[49:06] renewal of vow ceremony between Robert
[49:10] and Laurel Faby amen as I was uh looking
[49:15] for a scripture to read just briefly
[49:18] about this renewal of vow before we go
[49:20] into it this is the scripture that the
[49:22] lord gave me that came to my mind and
[49:24] this is what I'm going to pray to you
[49:26] it's in the book of deuteron Deuteronomy
[49:30] 8:2 we read this over and over but today
[49:33] it's going to be special for you because
[49:35] this is 40 years and you're going to
[49:37] find your 40 years in the scripture yes
[49:39] sir the Bible says in Deuteronomy
[49:41] chapter 8: 2 that if you want to open up
[49:45] that would be great you can join me I
[49:47] give you some few seconds so everybody
[49:49] can read it and see what the Lord is
[49:51] going to do to their lives from this day
[49:54] on am amen
[49:56] verse two and thou shall remember all
[49:59] the way which the Lord th God LED you
[50:03] these 40 Years of
[50:06] marriages Amen in the
[50:09] wilderness doesn't mean God was not
[50:11] there God provided with food God
[50:14] provided with water and everything I'm
[50:16] just going to read it to Humble thee and
[50:20] to prove thee to know what was in thine
[50:23] heart whether thou w keep his
[50:26] commandment or no and he humbled thee
[50:30] and suffered thee to hunger now you know
[50:32] what it means and fed thee with Mana
[50:35] which thou knowest not neither did thy
[50:38] father knows that he may make thee know
[50:41] that men do not leave by bread alone but
[50:45] by every word that proceed out of the
[50:48] mouth of the Lord do men leave so all
[50:50] these 40 years God want you to get to
[50:53] one conclusion that the word is is above
[50:55] everything amen he says thy Remnant
[50:58] works not old upon thee neither did thy
[51:02] foot swell these 40 years I don't see
[51:05] any of your feet fell so God has been
[51:08] gracious to us he said thou shall also
[51:11] consider in th heart that as a man
[51:14] chesten his son so the Lord thy God
[51:17] chesten thee therefore thou shall keep
[51:19] the Commandments of the Lord thy God to
[51:22] walk in his ways and to fear Him
[51:25] this is your message for the Lord thy
[51:28] God bring thee into a good land sir
[51:32] after this 40 Years of wilderness now
[51:34] you're going to transition to a
[51:36] different marriage different than what
[51:38] you have ever seen amen he said for the
[51:41] Lord thy God bringeth thee into a good
[51:44] land a land of Brooks of water of
[51:47] fountains and depths that spring out of
[51:50] valleys and Hills a land of Wheat and
[51:53] barley and Vine and and fig trees and
[51:56] palm grenades a land of olive oil and
[51:59] honey a land wherein th shall eat bread
[52:03] without scarceness thou shall not lack
[52:07] anything in it remind God this a land
[52:11] whose stones are iron and out of whose
[52:14] Hill thou mayest dig brass when thou has
[52:18] eaten and are full then thou shall bless
[52:22] the Lord thy God for the good land which
[52:25] he has given thee so the time of Mana is
[52:28] over now it's the time for you to eat

[1:10:04] so we can see if we do it today praise
[1:10:07] be to the name of the Lord then we can
[1:10:09] drop and pick up roof for the
[1:10:11] translation of the body amen unless the
[1:10:14] Lord give me a different direction so
[1:10:17] Job chapter
[1:10:18] 39 verse uh 27 very familiar scripture
[1:10:24] to you in this
[1:10:26] church so we should be good I believe
[1:10:30] the sermon on Wednesday is
[1:10:33] self-explanatory so clean up where you
[1:10:35] need to clean up and let's move on so
[1:10:37] God can bless you if you don't clean up
[1:10:40] you are blocking yourself God won't drop
[1:10:43] that blessing on you if you don't want
[1:10:45] to clean up because he's going to mess
[1:10:46] you up amen amen glory be to the name of
[1:10:50] the Lord verse uh 27 the B says does the
[1:10:55] eagle Mount up at your command and make
[1:10:59] her nest on high so we talking about an
[1:11:02] ego you might be seated
[1:11:06] amen we still about the Daily Bread amen
[1:11:10] amen we talked into we went down now we
[1:11:12] cling back up he says verse 27 does the
[1:11:16] ego Mount up at your command and make
[1:11:19] her nest on high she dwells and abides
[1:11:23] on what the Rock do you see where the
[1:11:25] ego
[1:11:27] says the eego are by the way upon the
[1:11:30] rock you know what it means right so the
[1:11:33] ego stays where with water
[1:11:38] Revelation so if you an eagle you need
[1:11:40] to stay where on the Rock uhhuh praise
[1:11:43] be to the name of the Lord verse 28 she
[1:11:46] dwell and abides on the Rock upon the
[1:11:49] crack of The Rock and the Strong place
[1:11:54] from there from The Rock there from the
[1:11:59] Revelation she does what seek the pray
[1:12:02] so where do you see where does the ego
[1:12:05] Seeker pray the rock so if the ego is on
[1:12:10] the rock as soon as he sits on the Rock
[1:12:13] then from that position of the rock he
[1:12:16] can begin to search the
[1:12:18] prey the prey is his food so the ego
[1:12:22] search the prey from a position of a
[1:12:26] revelation when he is standing on the
[1:12:29] Revelation this is when his eyes begin
[1:12:31] to
[1:12:32] screen everything because his eyes are
[1:12:35] anointed now amen this is the position
[1:12:39] that he sees
[1:12:43] Praise by pray we're talking about
[1:12:47] food we
[1:12:48] clear from there from The Rock she seeks
[1:12:52] the pray she spies out the food and her
[1:12:57] eyes behold what a far off so the eag
[1:13:00] sees far off from the rock so your
[1:13:03] vision gets more
[1:13:06] clear are we together when you are on
[1:13:09] the Revelation amen because without a
[1:13:11] revelation you don't see anything see
[1:13:13] nothing without a revelation you can be
[1:13:15] walking and trampling your blessing but
[1:13:18] you don't see the blessing but once the
[1:13:20] Revelation come on you you might look at
[1:13:22] the ground you say where a minute I'm
[1:13:24] sitting on a gold mine right here
[1:13:26] because of the Revelation so the
[1:13:28] Revelation give the ego the position to
[1:13:31] spy to see or to
[1:13:34] spy her praise or her food and also it
[1:13:38] give a uh an ego a clear per uh
[1:13:42] perspection
[1:13:44] perception
[1:13:46] perception the ego can see clearly when
[1:13:49] he sits on the Rock Amen her Young young
[1:13:53] one also do what suck up
[1:13:58] blood so the eego drink blood
[1:14:03] yes the eagle not only do they eat
[1:14:09] meat not only do they eat meat amen amen
[1:14:14] not only that's e go eat
[1:14:19] meat
[1:14:21] steak food but the eagle also drink
[1:14:30] blood SS gross but that's where the son
[1:14:34] of man is
[1:14:35] hidden
[1:14:37] amen her young one also suck up blood
[1:14:41] and where they slain are the carcass
[1:14:47] uh-huh there what she so if you want to
[1:14:50] find the ego somewhere if he's not on
[1:14:54] the nest on the Rock spying food you
[1:14:57] will see him laying on a carcass where
[1:15:01] there is a fresh kill amen where there
[1:15:03] is a slain where there is food there is
[1:15:06] a
[1:15:07] slain there is a carcass this carcass is
[1:15:11] not aena carcass because aena carcass
[1:15:14] are sometime rotten this is a fresh one
[1:15:17] am
[1:15:18] am
[1:15:20] amen amen if the eag already ate the
[1:15:24] meat or have the food or the the Meat
[1:15:28] part whatever you call it steak or
[1:15:31] whatever why what is the purpose of
[1:15:34] drinking
[1:15:38] blood what is in the
[1:15:42] blood what is in the blood you already
[1:15:45] got the meat yes sir you got the protein
[1:15:48] and everything what is in the blood that
[1:15:51] the eagle is sucking the young one are
[1:15:54] sacking the blood so they don't just eat
[1:15:57] meat but eego when they eat meat they
[1:16:00] also suck the blood in other word a food
[1:16:04] a eagle food must be a bleeding food
[1:16:09] am everybody okay whatever it is the
[1:16:12] meat of an eagle must be bleeding
[1:16:15] because the eagle eat or partake of the
[1:16:18] meat and then also drink blood what is
[1:16:21] in the blood what is the blood of an
[1:16:25] animal the blood of a prey the blood of
[1:16:29] of of a rabbit or whatever what is in
[1:16:31] the blood this is what the Bible says in
[1:16:34] Genesis chapter 9 verse4 the Bible say
[1:16:39] but the
[1:16:40] flesh which is over
[1:16:44] there let me put this this
[1:16:47] way I usually go slowly so we stay
[1:16:50] together okay if I Rush quickly like an
[1:16:52] evangelist at least some of you remain
[1:16:54] in a amen so but flesh with the life
[1:17:00] thereof which is the what the blood
[1:17:03] thereof shall ye not what eat so the
[1:17:07] blood has life
[1:17:10] am I'm reading the Bible yes sir the
[1:17:16] blood has life so when we talk about
[1:17:19] blood we talking about life amen amen
[1:17:24] amen so the food the meat
[1:17:27] ofo provide the
[1:17:31] life and provide also
[1:17:34] flesh keep that in mind Leviticus
[1:17:38] 17:14 for it is the life of All
[1:17:42] Flesh the blood of
[1:17:45] it is for the life thereof we clear
[1:17:49] therefore I say unto the children of
[1:17:51] Israel ye you shall not you shall eat
[1:17:54] the blood of no man or flesh for the
[1:17:58] life of All
[1:18:01] Flesh is what the blood thereof that's
[1:18:04] why our steak are well
[1:18:07] done amen God don't want as don't want
[1:18:11] his children didn't want anybody on
[1:18:13] Israel to eat blood but the
[1:18:17] ego out out can eat the Flesh and suck
[1:18:22] the
[1:18:23] blood the the eag are we together he
[1:18:27] said for the flesh for the life of All
[1:18:30] Flesh is the blood thereof whosoever eat
[1:18:34] it shall be how cut off so what I'm
[1:18:36] trying to draw from here is the blood is
[1:18:39] the life so when the ego is eating his
[1:18:42] food he's drawing
[1:18:45] nutrient right right to grow and he's
[1:18:49] also sacking life yes sir amen from the
[1:18:53] Fresh kill that he get the food of an
[1:18:56] igle provide nutrient and he also
[1:18:59] provide life amen are we together
[1:19:03] blessed be the name of the Lord let's go
[1:19:05] to Matthew
[1:19:06] 24 verse
[1:19:09] 27 glory be to
[1:19:16] God we give you many several example in
[1:19:19] the
[1:19:21] natural about our food and our thirst
[1:19:24] and everything now we climbing back up
[1:19:27] in the spiritual realm if you dare you
[1:19:30] can say Amen Matthew 24:
[1:19:33] 27
[1:19:36] amen the Bible say for as the lightning
[1:19:39] come out of the East and shine even to
[1:19:42] the what West so shall also the coming
[1:19:46] of who the son of man be so we talking
[1:19:49] about the son of man it's very important
[1:19:52] to understand understand his
[1:19:54] name the son of man you know what it
[1:19:56] means right son of man means
[1:20:02] what prophet
[1:20:04] amen verse 288 for where soever the what
[1:20:10] carcass is you remember that right from
[1:20:13] job wheresoever the carcass is there
[1:20:17] will the ego do what be gathered
[1:20:20] together so if there is no you won't get
[1:20:23] a
[1:20:26] eagle if you want to get Eagles in the
[1:20:30] [Applause]
[1:20:31] church Hallelujah you can preach
[1:20:34] whatever you want to preach in the
[1:20:35] church you will get a church full of
[1:20:37] people Pentecost are filled with people
[1:20:40] in the church but they don't have the
[1:20:44] caucus amen Baptist are filled with
[1:20:48] people we got mega churches in America
[1:20:51] where preacher are already in mess amen
[1:20:53] come on Amen the problem is an eagle
[1:20:57] don't care about the size of the church
[1:20:59] but the eagle is looking for the
[1:21:02] [Applause]
[1:21:04] carcass where the carcass is that's
[1:21:07] where you going to find the
[1:21:08] eagle if there is no cus the eego won't
[1:21:11] stay
[1:21:16] there but if you tell the eagle there is
[1:21:19] a carcass over there no matter what is
[1:21:22] here no matter how good this environment
[1:21:26] is no matter how many friends the ego
[1:21:28] got here the ego will Rel all his friend
[1:21:31] and go where the carcass is because
[1:21:34] where the carcass is it's where his life
[1:21:38] is that's where he can live that's where
[1:21:41] he can continue to grow if you stay in a
[1:21:44] place where there is no ccus no carcus
[1:21:47] then you die
[1:21:51] am
[1:21:54] in other word the location of an
[1:21:58] eagle depend upon the the availability
[1:22:03] of his
[1:22:05] food let me St it again so he goes all
[1:22:07] over America I don't know why I have to
[1:22:10] say this the location of an ego when an
[1:22:13] ego choose a
[1:22:15] location let me drop down again plan
[1:22:19] when a negro choose a
[1:22:21] church when an eagle choose a state am
[1:22:25] when an eagle choose a city where he's
[1:22:27] going to stay when an eagle is looking
[1:22:30] for a job before he can accept the job
[1:22:35] the eego must make sure there is a
[1:22:37] caucus where the job
[1:22:43] is because you can get your job but you
[1:22:46] will die
[1:22:48] spiritually and this is what is
[1:22:50] happening in America
[1:22:53] this is what is happening all over
[1:22:55] United
[1:22:56] States some of the eag say we can stay
[1:22:59] where we are but we can stream for a
[1:23:01] long distance the streaming is good if
[1:23:03] you were in
[1:23:06] church can you say Amen streaming
[1:23:10] started more after
[1:23:13] Co but if ego as they see Israel and
[1:23:18] everything that is going on they don't
[1:23:20] forsake the assembly
[1:23:23] they will try to be in church they don't
[1:23:26] take streaming for an excuse streaming
[1:23:29] is an it's it's it's a it's a
[1:23:34] supplement but it's not the man food
[1:23:37] they using streaming to supplement them
[1:23:41] but they must have a normal
[1:23:43] Church yes
[1:23:49] sir everybody together everybody body
[1:23:52] together so before you move somewhere
[1:23:55] else check for the
[1:23:57] caucus what I'm trying to say make sure

[1:24:20] life upon the upon the price of a car or

[1:33:21] Jesus said to her give me to
[1:33:25] drink for his disciple were gone away to
[1:33:28] the city to buy meat then says the woman
[1:33:32] of Samaria to him how is that you being
[1:33:35] a Jew ask drink of me which I am a woman
[1:33:40] of Samaria for the Jews have no dealings
[1:33:44] with the water Sam verse 10 and Jesus uh
[1:33:48] Jesus answered and said to her
[1:33:52] if you
[1:33:54] knew the gift of
[1:33:56] God Amen and who it is that say to you
[1:34:02] give me to drink so you got to know two
[1:34:05] things you have to know number one the
[1:34:09] gift of God the gift of
[1:34:12] God what is the gift of God
[1:34:17] call repent and be baptized in the name
[1:34:20] of the
[1:34:22] and you shall be filled with the gift of
[1:34:25] the what if you know the gift of God
[1:34:30] Amen and who and the
[1:34:33] person of
[1:34:37] Christ the one who's asking you to give
[1:34:40] me water if you know those two if you
[1:34:42] have a revelation of these two
[1:34:44] things if you know what was the Holy
[1:34:49] Spirit the holy spirit is the very life
[1:34:52] of
[1:34:56] God Amen if you knew the life of God and
[1:35:01] if you knew who was talking to you
[1:35:04] asking you for food for drink yes
[1:35:09] amen give me to drink you would have
[1:35:13] asked him in other word you will be the
[1:35:15] one asking that's right amen and he
[1:35:18] would have given you water Living Water
[1:35:21] so there is two waters
[1:35:24] there that's amen what I want you to
[1:35:28] remember is the Jesus that is talking
[1:35:31] here his name is the son of
[1:35:39] man Jesus the son of man amen and Jesus
[1:35:43] say if you know the gift of God and who
[1:35:47] it is that is talking to you the person
[1:35:49] that is talking to you you will be the
[1:35:51] one asking me and I will give you not
[1:35:53] your water there is two waters there is
[1:35:55] a natural water and there is also
[1:35:58] another another water which is a
[1:35:59] spiritual water which is the living
[1:36:01] water and Jesus say that person the one
[1:36:04] who is talking to you he would have give
[1:36:07] you living water so who got Living Water
[1:36:11] who has Living
[1:36:13] Water so the one who have living water
[1:36:16] is the son of man it's Jesus Christ
[1:36:19] himself so Jesus had
[1:36:23] water and the woman also had
[1:36:30] water there is a water
[1:36:33] natural amen and there is also a water
[1:36:37] that is spiritual the spiritual one is
[1:36:41] with Jesus and the natural one is in the
[1:36:46] well amen and Jesus is saying give me
[1:36:50] your word and the woman say ah you as
[1:36:53] American me and you there's no dealing
[1:36:55] with it he say if you knew who would ask
[1:36:58] you you will be the one as soon as you
[1:37:00] see me you say hey wait a minute give me
[1:37:02] water and the water that I can give you
[1:37:05] is not this
[1:37:06] one it's a living
[1:37:10] word this word is a Living
[1:37:15] Word a water that have
[1:37:18] life amen amen
[1:37:22] verse
[1:37:25] uh before I move there the one who has
[1:37:29] the word is the son of man in other word
[1:37:33] Jesus Christ even though he look like a
[1:37:36] man amen he was a
[1:37:42] notion amen he's a notion working like a
[1:37:46] man sir in other word in Jesus there was
[1:37:49] water am but you need to know who he is
[1:37:53] so he can give you the
[1:37:56] water the Bible says this in John
[1:37:59] chapter 1 verse 16 of his what
[1:38:03] fullness have we what all received so we
[1:38:06] all receive from his fullness because
[1:38:09] remember in Jesus Christ dwelleth the
[1:38:12] fullness of the godhead how Bly so Jesus
[1:38:16] have the fullness of God the whole ocean
[1:38:19] was with him and John is saying that
[1:38:22] from his fullness this is where we take
[1:38:25] one so every one of us can draw water
[1:38:27] from him are we together yes sir the
[1:38:31] Bible says in 1 Corinthians 12:3 for by
[1:38:35] how many Spirit one Spirit are we have
[1:38:37] all baptized into what one body whether
[1:38:40] we be who Jews or what Gentiles whether
[1:38:43] we be What bond or what and have been
[1:38:47] all made to do what drink into how many
[1:38:50] Spirit one spirit so all our drink our
[1:38:53] spiritual drink is in one
[1:38:55] man that's why he said if you knew who
[1:38:58] was talking with you you have the whole
[1:38:59] ocean here you have the fullness of God
[1:39:02] here you have the fullness of the Living
[1:39:05] Water right here amen if you knew that
[1:39:08] what you're talking to is really a
[1:39:11] fullness of water you could you should
[1:39:14] be the one asking the word first am am
[1:39:17] are we together verse 11 the B says that
[1:39:21] the woman says to him sir you have what
[1:39:25] nothing to draw so when Jesus is saying
[1:39:27] I'm going to give you living water the
[1:39:29] woman look he say where is Your Bucket
[1:39:33] you don't even have a bucket
[1:39:36] so where are you going to where are you
[1:39:38] going to get the water he said the woman
[1:39:41] said to him sir you have nothing to Jo
[1:39:44] and the well is how from where then have
[1:39:48] you that living water in other word
[1:39:49] where is that water coming from
[1:39:51] this woman need to ask
[1:39:57] Israel are we together because when
[1:39:59] Israel was journeying Into the
[1:40:01] Wilderness there was a rock following
[1:40:06] them everybody okay when Israel needed
[1:40:09] that water The Rock begin to produce
[1:40:12] natural
[1:40:14] water so Jesus not only produce
[1:40:18] spiritual water but he can also give you
[1:40:21] natural water am am amen this rock
[1:40:27] here this rock here when he was Israel
[1:40:32] in the
[1:40:33] wilderness amen he produced natural
[1:40:38] water so if this woman W water Jesus
[1:40:42] could have produced natural water and
[1:40:43] say Get it that's right amen but Jesus
[1:40:47] doesn't want to give it to her because
[1:40:50] he gave to Israel and all of them
[1:40:54] died are you following me I'm going to
[1:40:56] get to that but Jesus is talking about
[1:40:59] another water which is a spiritual
[1:41:02] water so it's a rock that can provide
[1:41:07] naturally and he can also provide
[1:41:11] spiritually but if you deal with that
[1:41:14] rock on the natural base
[1:41:17] only you can get the benefit and die
[1:41:21] and go to
[1:41:23] hell are you following me but if you
[1:41:25] deal with the rock on the spiritual L
[1:41:28] then that rock will produce both the
[1:41:30] natural and the
[1:41:32] spiritual are you following me so that
[1:41:36] Rock when he look at the woman he say if
[1:41:38] I give him the natural water it's not
[1:41:40] going to solve her situation I'm going
[1:41:41] to give her a different water and then I
[1:41:44] can rescue her in a different level are
[1:41:46] we together yes sir amen verse 12 are
[1:41:51] you greater than our father Jacob which
[1:41:54] gave us what the and drank theirself
[1:41:58] thereof himself and his children and his
[1:42:02] water Jesus answered and said to her
[1:42:05] whosoever drink of water this water
[1:42:07] shall do what thirst again this is
[1:42:10] natural if I give it to you now you're
[1:42:13] going to be satisfied tomorrow you will
[1:42:15] need it again tomorrow you will need it
[1:42:17] again and I'm able to do that have any
[1:42:21] problem but I want to qu something first
[1:42:25] am remember thirst it's in the natural
[1:42:28] and it's in the spiritual you got the
[1:42:30] thirst of the body you remember and
[1:42:32] there is a thirst of the Soul we clear
[1:42:35] now he says but
[1:42:37] whosoever drink of the water that I
[1:42:41] shall give him shall what never
[1:42:45] thirst but the water that I will give
[1:42:48] him shall be what in him a what a well
[1:42:51] of what water doing what up into ever
[1:42:55] springing up into what everlasting life
[1:42:58] so the water Jesus is talking about is
[1:43:01] not like I'm going to give you this
[1:43:03] bottle of water no no
[1:43:06] sir he said listen if I ask you water
[1:43:09] all you can do you can only give me a
[1:43:11] bucket I can drink and that's it but me
[1:43:15] I have a different world and that word
[1:43:18] if I give it to you number one you won't
[1:43:22] taste
[1:43:23] anymore everybody okay and if the word
[1:43:27] ever get into you that word become a
[1:43:31] well I'm reading to you the scripture in
[1:43:33] other word the word I'm giving you I'm
[1:43:36] not really giving you word I'm
[1:43:38] actually making you swallow a
[1:43:45] well and once that well is establishing
[1:43:48] you that well begin to produce use water
[1:43:52] that's why you won't tast anymore
[1:43:54] because you have your own personal
[1:43:56] resource of water that is quenching your
[1:43:59] thirst all the time in other word what
[1:44:03] I'm giving you is a well of water and
[1:44:06] that well of water will begin to produce
[1:44:08] water that's why you won't taste anymore
[1:44:14] hallu and that well of water can also
[1:44:17] produce your natural
[1:44:19] water a because the water that is coming
[1:44:22] up there is giving you eternal life so
[1:44:26] if you drink from that water you are
[1:44:28] drinking life if you sucking from the
[1:44:31] blood you sucking
[1:44:33] life are we together are we
[1:44:37] together verse 15 the woman says to him
[1:44:41] do what sir do what give me this water
[1:44:45] give me this water that I do what I
[1:44:47] thirst not neither come here to do what
[1:44:52] yes listen to this in Revelation 21: 6
[1:44:57] the Bible says this and he says unto me
[1:45:00] it is done I am what and whoa the
[1:45:04] beginning and the what end I will give
[1:45:07] unto him that do what is a thirst a
[1:45:10] fountain of what Water of Life how
[1:45:17] free Revelation 22:1 17 and the spirit
[1:45:22] and the bread says what come let him
[1:45:26] that Hearth say what come and let him
[1:45:28] that a thirst do what whosoever will let
[1:45:32] him take what The Water of Life how
[1:45:34] freely so Christ is our source of
[1:45:38] water in other words Jesus Christ is our
[1:45:42] Water of
[1:45:44] Life are we together are we together
[1:45:48] let's go to John chapter 7 we already
[1:45:50] prayed
[1:45:53] John chapter 7 and we start climbing
[1:45:56] verse 37 if you dare you can say amen
[1:45:59] God will give you water it's a spiritual
[1:46:02] water but once you drink that water that
[1:46:04] water become a
[1:46:06] well and a well springing up everlasting
[1:46:10] life that's why you don't trust anymore
[1:46:13] because in toward you inside of you you
[1:46:16] got
[1:46:17] water when your soul need it the soul
[1:46:20] continue to drink because there is a
[1:46:22] Fant there is a well that is bubbling
[1:46:24] inside and you don't have to ask
[1:46:26] anything
[1:46:27] anymore our water our thirst can be
[1:46:31] quenched yes sir by Christ we clear John
[1:46:35] 7:37 if you there you can say Amen in
[1:46:39] the last day that great day of the feast
[1:46:42] the Feast of Tabernacle Jesus stood and
[1:46:45] cried saying what if any man thirst If
[1:46:48] any man thirst remember thirst and
[1:46:51] hunger amen let him come unto me and do
[1:46:55] what he that believes on me as the
[1:46:59] scriptures has said out of his what
[1:47:02] belly shall flow what rivers of Living
[1:47:05] Water do you see
[1:47:06] that so you become a river in you out of
[1:47:10] that belly that belly is not your
[1:47:12] stomach that belly is your soul
[1:47:15] am in your soul there is a river Living
[1:47:20] Water and brother Bram said the well and
[1:47:22] the river means the same thing it is not
[1:47:25] two separate things he says out of his
[1:47:28] belly shall Flow River of water water do
[1:47:31] you see the same water in John 4 but he
[1:47:35] spoke he of what the spirit so that
[1:47:38] living water is what the Holy Ghost
[1:47:41] clear which day that believe on him
[1:47:45] should receive for the Holy Ghost was
[1:47:48] not yet given because that Jesus was not
[1:47:51] yet what
[1:47:55] glorified we clear so far we clear so
[1:47:58] far my subject this morning is teach us
[1:48:02] to pray
[1:48:04] Christ the water and the bread of the
[1:48:07] son of man
[1:48:08] am amen the water and the bread of the
[1:48:12] son of man we just seen clearly that the
[1:48:15] son of man is our water he's the one
[1:48:19] that gives us water amen the son of man
[1:48:23] give us water amen that's clear because
[1:48:27] he when he give you
[1:48:29] water he put a well in you he put a
[1:48:31] river in you and you yourself become a
[1:48:34] Fant of Living
[1:48:35] Water amen so if you need a water if you
[1:48:39] are thirsting you need to go where the
[1:48:41] son of man
[1:48:43] is amen are we together not the Son of
[1:48:47] God uhuh I'm talking about the son of
[1:48:49] man
[1:48:50] the one who was talking to the woman was
[1:48:53] the son of man the one who spoke in John
[1:48:55] 7 was the son of man the son of man
[1:48:58] means god is made
[1:49:01] flesh and God is made flesh in the
[1:49:05] office of a
[1:49:07] prophet when you see God is in human
[1:49:12] flesh in the office of a prophet then
[1:49:15] there is a f right there am amen amen
[1:49:21] everybody together we have been dealing
[1:49:24] with givers this day our daily bread or
[1:49:28] give us day by day our daily bread we
[1:49:32] understand what it means and we found
[1:49:34] out that this bread is establish a
[1:49:38] relationship between the one providing
[1:49:40] and the one who is in need that's why
[1:49:43] Joseph used the bread the corn of Egypt
[1:49:46] in order to bring the whole country of
[1:49:48] Egypt back to Pharaoh so that they
[1:49:50] country can be completely Pharaoh in
[1:49:53] other word all Egypt belong to Pharaoh
[1:49:55] the people belong to Pharaoh the land
[1:49:57] belong to Pharaoh the C belong to
[1:49:59] Pharaoh there is nothing in Egypt that
[1:50:01] doesn't belong to Pharaoh so pharaoh and
[1:50:04] his people become one and Joseph
[1:50:07] achieved that by the
[1:50:09] bread are we together are we together so
[1:50:13] this bread is not really to just give
[1:50:16] you food but it's a mean that the
[1:50:19] provider is you using to bring you back
[1:50:22] to himself
[1:50:24] am are we together are we together let's
[1:50:27] go to 1 Corinthians chapter
[1:50:30] 10 glory to
[1:50:33] godallah we good on time my
[1:50:36] friend 1 Corinthians chapter 10 as we
[1:50:44] claming 1 Corinthian chapter 10 verse 1
[1:50:48] very familiar scripture if you thereare
[1:50:51] you can say
[1:50:52] Amen moreover Brethren you there my
[1:50:55] friend yes I would not that you should
[1:50:58] be
[1:50:59] ignorant how that all our father were
[1:51:03] how under the and they passed through
[1:51:05] the what the
[1:51:07] SE we clear and they were all baptized
[1:51:12] to Moses in the cloud and in the sea and
[1:51:16] the word baptism you know that it's not
[1:51:18] something inside
[1:51:20] it is a not word expression it has
[1:51:23] nothing to do with the inside they were
[1:51:25] all baptized to Moses in the cloud and
[1:51:28] in the sea and they did eat of the water
[1:51:32] the same spiritual meat and did all
[1:51:34] drink of the water same spiritual drink
[1:51:37] so there is a drink and a meat
[1:51:40] amen are we together am there is a drink
[1:51:43] and a meat all of them are spiritual for
[1:51:46] they drunk of that spiritual water that
[1:51:49] did what follow and that rock was who
[1:51:52] Christ so Christ is the one that was
[1:51:54] producing water am and Christ doesn't
[1:51:57] only produce natural water but he also
[1:52:00] have living water with his spiritual
[1:52:03] water which is the holy spirit am
[1:52:05] because in Christ we all are baptized
[1:52:08] into one body and we drink into one
[1:52:11] Spirit are we together verse five but
[1:52:16] with what many of them God was not what
[1:52:20] we for they were how overthrown in the
[1:52:23] what the Wilderness so even though these
[1:52:26] people were under the
[1:52:28] cloud even though they were baptized
[1:52:31] unto Moses the
[1:52:33] prophet even though they were
[1:52:36] drinking and then eating both spiritual
[1:52:39] food God was not happy with them and God
[1:52:43] killed all of them why that's why are
[1:52:48] say that being in the message doesn't
[1:52:50] mean
[1:52:52] anything saying a message Church doesn't
[1:52:54] mean anything we need to know what is
[1:52:56] going on over there because you can be
[1:52:59] in the message but you are not in the
[1:53:02] message Hallelujah let me say that again
[1:53:05] you can be in the message camp but you
[1:53:08] are not in the message that's why
[1:53:11] brother Bram say we didn't come to talk
[1:53:13] about the message to argue about the
[1:53:15] message to discuss about the message but
[1:53:18] we come to get in the
[1:53:20] message and the message is
[1:53:25] Christ are we together are we together
[1:53:28] amen why did they die on the Wilderness
[1:53:31] why did God kill
[1:53:33] them why let's go to Hebrew chapter
[1:53:38] 3 glory to God
[1:53:42] Amen Hallelujah Hebrew chapter
[1:53:46] 3 verse 17 if you dare you can say Amen
[1:53:53] amen Hebrew
[1:53:55] 3:17 the Bible
[1:53:57] say but with whom was he griev how many
[1:54:01] years 40 years in the wilderness was he
[1:54:04] not with them that had
[1:54:06] sin amen out of all of them only two
[1:54:10] enters that's right whose caucus fell
[1:54:13] way in the wilderness and to whom saw he
[1:54:17] that they should not enter into what his
[1:54:20] rest so they could not enter in the rest
[1:54:23] amen but to them that did what believe
[1:54:27] not how can you see what Moses did and
[1:54:31] you don't
[1:54:35] believe how can you drink from a rock
[1:54:39] and you don't believe how can you eat
[1:54:41] Mana every day coming from heaven and
[1:54:43] you don't
[1:54:44] believe what kind of unbelief is
[1:54:48] this in word God was taking care of them
[1:54:52] as a father and he was doing that to
[1:54:56] catch their
[1:54:58] faith but they could not clamp to the
[1:55:01] faith and God got tired and say this is
[1:55:03] not the Generation Kill Them
[1:55:06] All but they were baptized under the
[1:55:10] crow they went all the way to the Red
[1:55:12] Sea they eat the spiritual food
[1:55:15] spiritual manner drank water but with
[1:55:18] all of them God was please because to
[1:55:21] please
[1:55:22] God you must have what fath it is
[1:55:25] impossible without faith to please God
[1:55:28] because him that come to God must
[1:55:30] believe that God is what and he's the
[1:55:33] rewarder of those that do
[1:55:35] what so these people follow God but did
[1:55:38] not believe
[1:55:41] God are we together I'm getting there my
[1:55:45] friend verse 19 the Bible say so we see
[1:55:48] that they could not enter in because of
[1:55:51] what unbelief so everything that was
[1:55:54] done all the miracle it looks like they
[1:55:57] believe but they didn't believe so God
[1:56:00] was trying to pull them to a different
[1:56:02] level but they would not go up God sent
[1:56:06] Mana he say I sent Mana to teach you
[1:56:08] something they don't understand he sent
[1:56:10] what that they don't understand he sent
[1:56:11] what they don't he said no no no let me
[1:56:13] wipe them all let's go to verse four
[1:56:15] verse one let us therefore do what fear
[1:56:21] L A Promise being left of us of entering
[1:56:24] in into the rest any of you should seem
[1:56:27] what in other word be
[1:56:31] careful because there were people like
[1:56:34] you that experience God doing many thing
[1:56:38] in their life but still they were not
[1:56:40] believing what they were
[1:56:43] following maybe you don't understand
[1:56:45] what I'm saying this is why after 30
[1:56:49] years
[1:56:50] people are leaving the
[1:56:52] message they follow the message they
[1:56:55] were blessed by the message they got
[1:56:57] money from the message they got housing
[1:57:00] from the message and after 20 years the
[1:57:03] message was not good because all and
[1:57:05] long they never believe the
[1:57:08] message they even preach the message but
[1:57:11] they never believe the message Judah
[1:57:14] preached the gospel but Judah never
[1:57:17] believe on Jesus Christ
[1:57:20] amen how can you be in the message 25
[1:57:23] years and then you
[1:57:26] leave we were calling you brothers and
[1:57:28] sisters and you are more holy than all
[1:57:31] of us you wear so long dresses we
[1:57:35] thought you the spiritual sister yes sir
[1:57:37] many of them God God was not pleased
[1:57:40] with them in other way they were
[1:57:42] following the message they were in the
[1:57:45] camp of the message but they never
[1:57:47] believ the message amen
[1:57:50] are we together are we together God say
[1:57:53] you need to feel you need to examine
[1:57:55] where you are are you here to get the
[1:57:58] Tiding of the message and then after 25
[1:58:01] years you live with the Tiding of the
[1:58:03] message if you leave the message return
[1:58:05] everything that the message gave
[1:58:11] you if you are baren and we pray for you
[1:58:15] and you start having children if you
[1:58:17] leave the message leave your children
[1:58:19] back the
[1:58:21] [Applause]
[1:58:24] message because we take the benefit of
[1:58:26] the message but we don't want the
[1:58:29] message this is what God is telling
[1:58:32] Israel I am giving you benefit but
[1:58:35] that's not what I'm looking for I want
[1:58:38] you to clim
[1:58:42] higher are we together Shake somebody
[1:58:45] else hand my friend you know what it
[1:58:47] means Glory to God we there we there God
[1:58:53] destroyed them because of what unbelief
[1:58:56] so do not be surprise young people when
[1:58:59] they tell you so and so left the message
[1:59:01] don't be it happened in the firstday it
[1:59:04] is even a good proof that we are
[1:59:07] following the right
[1:59:10] [Applause]
[1:59:12] thing because the first Exodus had the
[1:59:15] pillar of fire the second Exodus has the
[1:59:18] pillar of Fire our Exodus had the pillar
[1:59:21] of fire so what happened there must
[1:59:23] happen today because Jesus Christ is the
[1:59:28] same if it doesn't happen we got a wrong
[1:59:31] message but because it happened now we
[1:59:34] know we are in the
[1:59:37] [Applause]
[1:59:40] truth in other word they living of
[1:59:43] people in the message it's actually
[1:59:45] stabilizing the
[1:59:48] elect
[1:59:52] the devil thought he's making a big show
[1:59:56] he didn't know that the elect now begin
[1:59:59] to be convinced that really this message
[2:00:02] is
[2:00:05] right all things work together for
[2:00:11] [Music]
[2:00:13] good it
[2:00:15] Lord when you see Judas betraying Jesus
[2:00:18] Christ is he
[2:00:20] it is very good but I'm not Judas but
[2:00:23] it's very good because the F because the
[2:00:26] script CH fulfilled and I'm I'm very
[2:00:29] sure of Jesus
[2:00:30] [Music]
[2:00:34] Christ it depend on the angle you
[2:00:37] looking at my friend so don't be
[2:00:39] discouraged and don't be talk about oh
[2:00:41] so and so he's leaving the message so
[2:00:44] they left the message because they were
[2:00:46] not in the
[2:00:48] message
[2:00:49] [Music]
[2:00:51] for me the message is in
[2:00:56] me so if I live I'm living with the
[2:01:04] message that's why David say though I
[2:01:07] walk in the water of the shadow of what
[2:01:10] the message is still with
[2:01:13] me
[2:01:16] hall hallelujah do you know Jesus went
[2:01:19] to hell do you know how he went to hell
[2:01:22] with which body did he
[2:01:24] take he took the theop the theop is the
[2:01:28] word so he Enter Hell with the word so
[2:01:32] if you take me to hell I will enter with
[2:01:35] the
[2:01:36] [Applause]
[2:01:41] message in other words nothing can
[2:01:44] separate me from the
[2:01:46] message
[2:01:48] I if you C here you see the message you
[2:01:51] cut again you see the
[2:01:53] [Applause]
[2:01:54] message I smell like the
[2:01:58] message I'm sweating the
[2:02:09] message this ceron is going a different
[2:02:11] direction bu let's go to verse four
[2:02:14] chapter 4 he said uh uh verse two he
[2:02:17] said for to as was what the gospel
[2:02:21] preached continue my friend as well as
[2:02:23] unto them but the what word preach did
[2:02:26] what not profit them why not being mixed
[2:02:29] with faith in them that
[2:02:33] hurt so they heard the message but the
[2:02:36] message doesn't change them because when
[2:02:39] the message enter in them there is no
[2:02:43] decoder come
[2:02:45] on because when the message come he must
[2:02:48] find the message
[2:02:49] and the message and the message mix
[2:02:51] together and then they blend
[2:02:56] together amen for we which have what
[2:03:00] believe we do enter where into rest as
[2:03:03] he said as I have what sworn in my wrath
[2:03:06] if they shall enter into my rest
[2:03:09] although they what
[2:03:12] work were what were finished where from
[2:03:15] the foundation of the world so this
[2:03:17] whole thing is connected with
[2:03:22] predestination when we all hear the
[2:03:24] message we are hearing the message
[2:03:27] according to our seed
[2:03:30] hallah Hallelujah if we come from God we
[2:03:34] are hearing God when God is talking we
[2:03:37] listening to the same message but we got
[2:03:40] different
[2:03:41] interpretation in somebody else there is
[2:03:43] no faith amen no faith means there is no
[2:03:47] nothing in them to decode the message
[2:03:51] but in somebody else when they look they
[2:03:53] say wow I see it and somebody's looking
[2:03:57] he say I don't see
[2:04:01] it amen amen let's go to John chapter
[2:04:07] 6 glory to God Amen God was trying to
[2:04:13] bring Israel up but he found out there
[2:04:16] is a
[2:04:17] generation that no matter what he did
[2:04:20] nothing is working why because of
[2:04:22] unbelief because of lack of faith there
[2:04:25] is nothing the message doesn't work and
[2:04:27] after a while guess what they walk
[2:04:30] out amen did you eat the spiritual food
[2:04:34] yes did you eat Mana yes but they never
[2:04:37] believe the message even though they
[2:04:39] were eating the things of the
[2:04:41] message we clear watch the same scenario
[2:04:45] now in John 6 my friend then I'm going
[2:04:47] to start claming with the the quot of
[2:04:49] brother brandham you there amen John

[2:05:32] they saw his miracles which he did on
[2:05:35] them that were diseased so they were
[2:05:37] following Jesus Christ because of
[2:05:40] what so the first pool attracted
[2:05:45] them everybody want him in the church
[2:05:51] the miracle was not because Israel saw
[2:05:54] the miracle but God killed all of
[2:05:57] them they saw the miracle but they never
[2:06:00] believe we will see these people they
[2:06:02] are following Jesus Christ because of
[2:06:05] what it looks like they

[2:06:11] Believers great multitude because of
[2:06:16] what Miracle J them into the message

[2:06:25] uh which he did on them that were whatas
[2:06:28] so we talking about the
[2:06:31] healing which is the first pole you
[2:06:34] understand this thing now we clear am
[2:06:37] verse three and Jesus went up into a
[2:06:39] mountain and there he sat with his
[2:06:42] disciple and the Passover a feast of the
[2:06:45] Jews was nine when Jesus then lift up up
[2:06:48] his eyes he saw what a great company
[2:06:52] this is now Jesus seeing in other words

[2:06:58] and he look he
[2:07:00] said I got a big company I got a big
[2:07:03] church

[2:07:11] disciple coming to who they were coming
[2:07:14] to Jesus what a beautiful thing a great
[2:07:17] company coming to him
[2:07:19] he says to who pH for your information
[2:07:22] if you go to the Book of Mark this place
[2:07:25] was a
[2:07:27] Wilderness if you need a scripture see
[2:07:29] me after church this place was a desert
[2:07:34] amen that's what the Bible says amen
[2:07:37] when he saw the big company he says to
[2:07:40] who in The Book of Mark the Bible say he
[2:07:43] says to them but John is an eagle so he
[2:07:47] have a focus very good am amen when he
[2:07:50] focused he say no it was not just them
[2:07:53] it was really Phillip we clear and then
[2:07:57] he says to Phillip where shall we buy
[2:08:01] [Applause]
[2:08:05] what are we together where shall we buy
[2:08:08] what bread for what that these may eat
[2:08:12] why did he only ask to Phil
[2:08:16] Phillip he looked at the mountain
[2:08:19] and he turned to Phillip he said hey
[2:08:21] Phillip where can we find bread for
[2:08:24] these
[2:08:26] people watch Phillip amen and he says
[2:08:31] verse 6 and this he says to do what
[2:08:34] prove him for he himself what knew what
[2:08:38] he would do so before he asked the
[2:08:41] question Jesus already knew what he was
[2:08:47] doing so if if you knew what you're
[2:08:49] doing why do you ask Phillip the
[2:08:53] question can I continue verse S Phillip
[2:08:57] answered him stop let's go to verse uh
[2:09:02] five so we we get this together Jesus
[2:09:05] asked him where shall we buy bread that
[2:09:09] these people may do What Jesus was
[2:09:12] asking for
[2:09:16] location did have I read anything
[2:09:19] Jesus says where in other word tell me
[2:09:22] where I need an answer the answer is a
[2:09:26] zby a McDon a Walmart and a Target
[2:09:32] that's all I want you to do Jesus said
[2:09:34] where show me the place did they ask him
[2:09:37] how much money he had watch what Philip
[2:09:40] is
[2:09:41] answering when you read the Bible go
[2:09:44] slowly Jesus is asking the location
[2:09:47] right
[2:09:49] because he knew amen now let's go to
[2:09:51] verse seven philli answer him 200 what
[2:09:55] pen wor of bread is not what sufficient
[2:09:58] for did Jesus ask him how much money he
[2:10:01] has no Finance so Jesus knew who to
[2:10:08] poke everybody okay he says all I ask
[2:10:12] you show me where Philip begin to say oh
[2:10:15] no uh with 200 penny that have here I
[2:10:19] don't think did I did I ask you how much
[2:10:22] money you
[2:10:23] have did I ask you how much money do oh
[2:10:27] did I ask you do we have sufficient
[2:10:30] money to be able to buy bread for this I
[2:10:32] didn't ask you that I just ask you where
[2:10:36] exactly right Philip is coming up with a
[2:10:38] number he said 200 penny a penny was the
[2:10:42] salary of one day wow you remember the
[2:10:46] 11 workers hour they were giving them a
[2:10:48] penny do you remember so if you take 200
[2:10:52] Penny it's like a salary of 7
[2:10:56] months so Phillip is saying even if you
[2:11:00] take a man's salary for seven
[2:11:03] month it won't work with what we have is
[2:11:06] that the answer to the
[2:11:08] question Jesus knows how to squeeze
[2:11:13] you so that your brain can go Po and you
[2:11:17] can't think no more he said that's what
[2:11:19] I was looking for now that you stuck in
[2:11:22] your brain that's what I was looking for
[2:11:24] are we together Philip answered him 200
[2:11:28] penny worth of bread is not sufficient
[2:11:30] for them that every one of them may take
[2:11:33] what little one of his disciple Angel
[2:11:37] Simon Peter's brother says to him there
[2:11:40] is a lad here which have what five
[2:11:43] barley Loaves and what two small fishes
[2:11:47] but what what are are they among so many
[2:11:51] brother you bringing a solution and you
[2:11:54] discrediting the
[2:11:56] solution I ask you where is the location
[2:11:59] oh no uh in our bank account here we
[2:12:02] only have 200 I don't see how it's going
[2:12:03] to work here that's not the question
[2:12:05] somebody come and say oh I have bread
[2:12:07] okay but even though we have bread but
[2:12:10] this bread won't work so why did you
[2:12:11] bring them to begin with if you know
[2:12:14] it's not going to
[2:12:16] work are we together
[2:12:18] so Jesus is offering two
[2:12:22] possibilities are you following me so
[2:12:25] this bread can be purchased with
[2:12:29] money amen oh Jesus can use the direct
[2:12:36] substance that he has which is
[2:12:40] bread and fish yes but this is the
[2:12:45] least potential because this one can
[2:12:49] provide more bread than the lad
[2:12:54] lunch are we together so Jesus could
[2:12:57] have used
[2:13:00] both source and provide bread because
[2:13:04] money brother Bram say is a purchase
[2:13:07] power and brother Bram show us many time
[2:13:10] that faith is like money he says if
[2:13:13] you're looking for a laot of bread and
[2:13:15] they give you money for it you man just
[2:13:18] get us happy because you got the bread
[2:13:20] in you so Jesus could use
[2:13:24] money and multiply money right follow me
[2:13:28] and give
[2:13:30] money and then they go buy the bread and
[2:13:33] bring it oh Jesus can multiply the bread
[2:13:37] and give it but if Jesus multipli the
[2:13:39] money they still have to rent to you
[2:13:45] H are we together yes because the number
[2:13:49] of the company was so big so if you need
[2:13:52] even if you get money you need to go get
[2:13:54] a big truck so you can go get money uh I
[2:13:58] mean bread for so many people and bring
[2:14:00] it back so that the people can eat but
[2:14:03] if we got bread here if we can transform
[2:14:06] that to a
[2:14:09] manufacturer are we together on the spot
[2:14:12] then we are saving ourself from renting
[2:14:15] a car renting a ass renting horses and
[2:14:18] we got the money but this solution is
[2:14:21] there less promising and that's what
[2:14:24] Jesus picks
[2:14:27] up the less promising
[2:14:30] one the man is even promising but they
[2:14:34] won the two the the kid lunch for one
[2:14:38] not an adult lunch because an adult
[2:14:41] lunch you can CED in kids the kid so
[2:14:44] it's only for the kid the very last
[2:14:47] resources Jesus said that's where I'm
[2:14:49] going to
[2:14:51] get what is Jesus teaching this great
[2:14:55] multitude Amen in the wilderness he says
[2:14:58] give me the lunch they give him the
[2:15:00] lunch he said make them sit together
[2:15:03] let's go let's go let's go and he feed
[2:15:07] everybody and everybody is full and he
[2:15:10] even give more until they say father
[2:15:13] that's enough he
[2:15:15] stop he used the least
[2:15:18] substance we clear let me save some time
[2:15:21] jop to verse 11 if you dare you can say
[2:15:24] amen amen and Jesus Took the Loaves and
[2:15:28] when he had given thanks he did what
[2:15:30] distributed to the disciples continue my
[2:15:32] friend and the disciples to them that
[2:15:34] were set down and likewise also the what
[2:15:37] the fishes as much as they would uh-huh
[2:15:39] when they were filled he said to the
[2:15:41] disciple gather up the fragment we don't
[2:15:44] want to wastage that remain for that be
[2:15:48] lost therefore they gathered them
[2:15:50] together and did what fill 12 baskets
[2:15:53] with the fragments of the five barley Lo
[2:15:55] which remain over and above to them that
[2:15:57] had water listen clearly they follow
[2:16:01] Jesus for the miracle watch verse 14
[2:16:05] then those men when they had seen the
[2:16:08] what Miracle not the miracle of the
[2:16:13] healing are we together on verse two

[2:22:23] reading the Bible I'm just going to give
[2:22:25] the Bible let's go quickly to that
[2:22:27] converstion when the converstion is
[2:22:29] finished we got
[2:22:31] fellowship and after Fellowship I will
[2:22:33] see my body we have free food amen I'm
[2:22:37] telling you the food over there was so
[2:22:43] delicious are we together so we are
[2:22:46] following the message because we got the
[2:22:49] benefit out of
[2:22:53] it Lord the reason I'm staying in this
[2:22:57] message if I declare to my church that I
[2:23:01] don't believe brother Bram the Turing
[2:23:03] will
[2:23:06] disappear I will lose my source of
[2:23:09] income that's why I have to dute the
[2:23:12] message a little bit no in this church
[2:23:15] don't read the prophet but we still
[2:23:17] believe the message but do not read the
[2:23:20] prophet on the puet but we believe the
[2:23:22] message this picture we believe it but
[2:23:25] don't put the over
[2:23:28] there because we want the source of
[2:23:31] income we want
[2:23:33] theing we want the
[2:23:37] [Music]
[2:23:38] offering say Amen am I'm not telling you
[2:23:43] when I say say amen I want to get some
[2:23:45] feedback my friend okay say Amen my
[2:23:48] friend this is the problem we thought
[2:23:51] they were looking Jesus Christ for their
[2:23:54] life come on Jesus say you see you're
[2:23:56] not looking I know I know exactly what
[2:23:58] you I know why you hanging around
[2:24:01] me this is the message my friend verse
[2:24:04] 27 Jesus says what labor not for what
[2:24:08] the meat which perishes we clear labor
[2:24:11] not for the meat that perishes everybody
[2:24:14] okay labor not for the meat with perish
[2:24:17] but from the meat which does what
[2:24:20] endureth unto everlasting life so there
[2:24:22] is a food that give eternal life and
[2:24:25] there is a word that give eternal
[2:24:29] life now we found out that in Christ we
[2:24:33] got the food and the drink both of them
[2:24:36] give eternal life and Jesus said do not
[2:24:40] labor for this thing because you if I
[2:24:43] give if you drink the water you going to
[2:24:45] be thirsty again this food I gave it to
[2:24:48] you tomorrow you following me if I give
[2:24:50] you this food tomorrow you're going to
[2:24:51] follow me but that's not the main
[2:24:53] concern the reason why I demonstrated
[2:24:56] this thing is not for you to really look
[2:24:58] at food I want you to look at who is
[2:25:01] there if you knew the gift of God and
[2:25:05] the one who asking you food because
[2:25:08] money was here right right right right
[2:25:11] you f me money was unable to feed the
[2:25:14] great
[2:25:15] multitude the lunch was there but the
[2:25:19] lunch was unable to feed 5,000 but what
[2:25:23] fed the people is not really bread and
[2:25:27] fish it is not really the money it is
[2:25:30] the person of Jesus Christ so if Jesus
[2:25:35] is there that's what matters whether
[2:25:38] there is bread or not whether there is
[2:25:40] money or not if Christ is there he can
[2:25:43] produce the
[2:25:45] food do you follow me yes if Christ is
[2:25:48] there he can make Mana rain from Heaven
[2:25:51] if Christ is there he can bring water
[2:25:53] from the rock do you follow me do you
[2:25:56] follow
[2:25:58] me verse 27 labor not for the meat which
[2:26:02] perishes but for the meat which inth to
[2:26:05] what everlasting life water that spring
[2:26:07] up unto everlasting life now it's not
[2:26:10] water it is now meat that spring up to
[2:26:12] everlasting life which The Who son of
[2:26:15] man which The Who son of man this food
[2:26:19] come from who the son of so it's a food
[2:26:22] that come from the son of
[2:26:25] man not the Son of
[2:26:28] God the son of man shall give you for
[2:26:33] what him ha God the Father
[2:26:36] seal do you know what it means this food
[2:26:40] only come from the son of man because
[2:26:43] the son of man is where the father put
[2:26:47] his
[2:26:48] approval so if you want to find the
[2:26:51] approval of God you need to find the son
[2:26:53] of man because the son of man have a
[2:26:55] food if you get the food that
[2:26:59] [Applause]
[2:27:01] say who is the son of
[2:27:04] man everybody okay everybody okay who is
[2:27:08] the Son of God the son of man but the
[2:27:11] problem say in the rising of the son the
[2:27:14] sun he says now who is what the son of
[2:27:17] man in the beginning was what the word
[2:27:20] and the Word was what with God and the
[2:27:22] Word was what and the Word was made what

[2:27:28] is who the
[2:27:34] word the son of man has a food and
[2:27:38] brother say who is the son of man he say

[2:33:06] Jesus said to them verily verily I said
[2:33:09] to you Moses gave you not that bread for
[2:33:12] heaven in other word that manner that
[2:33:14] you're talking about you didn't from
[2:33:17] Moses I was the one that was giving you
[2:33:20] the man your father I'm the one that
[2:33:23] provided the father Moses was only a
[2:33:25] prophet but the one that created the
[2:33:28] squel is
[2:33:32] me do you follow me yes sir do you
[2:33:34] follow me yes sir he says but but my
[2:33:38] father giv you here the what the true
[2:33:41] bread from heaven for the bread of God
[2:33:43] is what is which he come is is he which
[2:33:47] cometh down from heaven and give life to
[2:33:49] the who the world everybody clear then
[2:33:52] say they to him Lord everm more give us
[2:33:56] this
[2:33:57] bread and Jesus said to them I
[2:34:02] am do you see are we clear now I am what
[2:34:05] the bread of life in other words the son
[2:34:07] of man is the bread of
[2:34:09] life you following me he's not just the
[2:34:12] Living Water he's also the bread I am
[2:34:15] the bread of Life do you follow me yes
[2:34:17] sir he that comes to me shall what never
[2:34:20] hunger in John 4 he that come to me
[2:34:22] shall never thirst over here shall never
[2:34:26] hunger so he's both the water and he's
[2:34:28] also the bread are you following
[2:34:30] me he that come to me shall never hunger
[2:34:34] and he that believe on me shall never
[2:34:36] what thirst but I say to you that you
[2:34:40] also have seen me and do what believe
[2:34:42] not so they didn't believe that's it
[2:34:45] amen they seen the miracle of healing
[2:34:48] they seen Jesus creating still they
[2:34:50] can't believe Jesus
[2:34:53] Christ Israel drunk water did this still
[2:34:57] not Bel what's going on look at Jesus
[2:34:59] Christ he's going back to to to
[2:35:02] predestination verse 37 all that the
[2:35:05] father did what giveth me shall do what
[2:35:08] come to me and him that come to me I
[2:35:11] will know what in no wise cast out are
[2:35:13] we clear jum to verse 41 the Jews then
[2:35:17] murmur at him because he says I am what
[2:35:20] the bread which come down from what
[2:35:22] heaven and they say to him and they say
[2:35:25] is not this Jesus the son of Joseph now
[2:35:29] they begin to find fault when he was
[2:35:31] doing miracle they didn't worry about
[2:35:33] the son of Joseph when he was creating
[2:35:35] bread they were eating they didn't worry
[2:35:37] about the son of Joseph now they begin
[2:35:40] to argue with him being the son of
[2:35:41] Joseph when brother Bram was here nobody
[2:35:44] argue with him
[2:35:47] now today we begin to argue whether this
[2:35:50] was true or not when he was here nobody
[2:35:53] attacked the
[2:35:54] flag the cloud over
[2:35:57] [Applause]
[2:36:01] there you didn't know he was a son of
[2:36:03] Charles
[2:36:06] andam he says is not this Jesus the son
[2:36:09] of Joseph I thought they say he was the
[2:36:12] Messiah now they begin to say the son of
[2:36:15] Joseph in other we know his father he's
[2:36:17] no
[2:36:20] God who father and what mother we know
[2:36:24] they are denying the very deity that
[2:36:27] they saw in their own
[2:36:29] eyes he says he says how is it then that
[2:36:34] he say I come down from what heaven the
[2:36:37] Messiah should come from Heaven you
[2:36:39] testify I was the Messiah now I'm
[2:36:41] telling you I came from the heaven you
[2:36:43] say no your father was here we remember
[2:36:46] we have your birth certificate in
[2:36:48] Carolina Medical Center over
[2:36:50] there Jesus therefore answer and say to
[2:36:54] them murmur not you among what
[2:36:57] yourselves we clear we clear no man can
[2:37:01] come to me except what the Father which
[2:37:04] has sent me did what and I will raise
[2:37:06] him up where the last day jum to verse
[2:37:09] 38 my 48 I am what that bread of life
[2:37:13] your father did eat man in the
[2:37:16] wilderness and are what you are
[2:37:18] reproducing exactly what your father did
[2:37:21] after the miracle I did your father did
[2:37:24] eat man in the wilderness and now what
[2:37:26] this is the bread which come down from
[2:37:29] what heaven that a man eateth thereof
[2:37:31] and what not die I am the living bread
[2:37:35] which come down from heaven If any man
[2:37:37] eat of what this bread he shall live how
[2:37:40] forever and the bread that I will give
[2:37:42] is is what my flesh uh-huh which I give
[2:37:47] for the life of the what so the bread is

[2:37:55] yes sir yes sir the bread that I'm
[2:37:58] talking about is my
[2:38:00] flesh can I continue he says the Jews
[2:38:04] therefore strove among themselves saying
[2:38:07] can this man give us what his to
[2:38:12] eat the people that follow the miracle
[2:38:15] the people that testify about the
[2:38:17] message now the third pool is unfolding
[2:38:20] the
[2:38:21] word decreasing the number of the
[2:38:26] multitude removing those that were in
[2:38:29] the message for so long because God is
[2:38:32] about to do something new
[2:38:35] yes
[2:38:37] yes if they stick around they will learn
[2:38:40] the secret of life so I need to give
