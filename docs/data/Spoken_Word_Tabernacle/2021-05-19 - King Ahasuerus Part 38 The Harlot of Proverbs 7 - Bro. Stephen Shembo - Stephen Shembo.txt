believe you all know this all the songs this evening are just from the believer's song book that's where i get a lot of the songs that i do and sometimes it surprises me because when i practice my wife she'll be like i've never heard this song before i'm like it's a believer songbook this is this is where all the message songs came from so if you all don't know it we'll teach them to you but like i said most of them this evening just have come right out of the believer's songbook so i i trust that you know them and just sing along with me and if not you're going to learn them is no

because when i was really really little little she used to say uh hey abel how do you spell salvation and i knew how to spell it and people were like man how do you learn that word at such a young age it was this song it was one of my favorites when i was a little boy so if it teaches your kid at the age of three or four how to spell salvation it's doing something right so praise the lord amen

name of the lord you ready tonight it seems like the confinement is going away we're kind of bringing us closer and closer together amen we thank god for his grace remember on saturday you know where to meet right meeting a brother kelly's home for our house meeting amen yeah so i believe brother david was saying the text for the address i'm not sure if they already send it but if it's not you're going to receive it and please if possible be there on time amen if you come late then we're gonna wait for you to eat and then start with the question and answer and we're losing time and before you know it there won't be any more time left and we will only touch to a certain part so by god's grace make sure you're there on time if possible if you're not working one time brother robert is it three o'clock or four o'clock three o'clock so brother kelly say three o'clock so at three o'clock b day amen if not we're going to start the problem is we don't record those last time somebody probably recorded but we usually don't record those if we do record i keep it because it's people asking questions directly and we want to keep that secure for the church amen yes so you're there make sure you be there on time and we can fellowship and have a good time and keep that in prayer as well so everything goes fine by the grace of god amen if you're not excited about it i'm already excited if you're not i'm already excited about it i was going over the questions and as i was doing that at work today i felt an anointing dropping and i was already happy by just starting to answer one question he opened the door to another scripture he opened the door to another scripture he opened the door to another scripture and i finally even understood why brother branham say enoch had a rapture in faith but random never gave a scripture to the best of my understanding now i can see it in the bible in the scripture why he say enoch head rupturing faith now i see it clearly oh my god it was right there so when brother branham say something i believe you well enough trained in this church remember whether you understand it or not take it believe it and move forward because most the majority of time we prove it to you the message is perfectly aligned with them somebody's awake the message is perfectly aligned with what somebody's still not really awake the message is perfectly aligned with water okay now we can talk amen so remember this sunday we will have brother darrell ward preaching for us so keep the service in prayer i know brother odero so it's going to be a great blessing for the church that's an anointed preacher amen if you never experience him just be there on sunday stay prayed up and before you know it you will feel like there is oil dropping into the room amen that's the way brother daryl preaches if you don't know him just wait on sunday and you'll figure it out but he's a wonderful preacher let's go to our reading tonight i hope the setting won't disturb somebody's we got used to the other side let's go malachi too everybody up to date with the sermon on sunday everybody there nobody lagging behind amen ah i don't like when i talk to somebody and they four sermons behind i usually wonder what were you doing monday tuesday wednesday thursday friday saturday fourth sermon second two three i'm wondering and i hope if you four sermons behind you must be maybe ten uh political stuff behind not being on up to date on politics and you're behind in church that doesn't work malachi chapter 2 verse 7. everybody there remember god made us a kingdom of priest we already know that amen we already explained that for the priests lips were kingdom of priests so what should they find on our lips politics for the priests lips should keep water what kind of knowledge for the priest sleeps should keep knowledge and they should seek the law at his mouth so if people want to know want to be comforted they need some word of wisdom or something they need to come to you and you must be ready to have that word in your mouth ready to answer ready to comfort ready to strengthen ready to be spoken amen and the priest's lips should keep knowledge and they should seek the law at his mouth so they're not coming to you to ask you a question about politics or whatever is going into the world if people call you to ask you a question about politics all the time you better wake up amen for the priesthood should keep knowledge and they should seek the law at his mouth for he is the messenger of the lord of water as a messenger the lord give him the word and the word is in your mouth and the people come to you because they need the word of god if they need politics they know where to get them if they want to know what is going on in the neighborhood they know where to get it if they want to know what is going on in every message churches they know where to get it but when somebody approach you they must be approaching you to learn something from god amen let's go to matthew chapter four you might be seated i'm not saying they cannot ask you where you can buy something in walmart but i'm talking about your life your very life should be centered around the word of god amen hallelujah if you dig deep in this message you don't have to chase anybody the people just by themselves drop off they found out that you're a different specie when you talk brother branham say the bible say brother brother i'm saying the bible say after a while either somebody will stay there because the law of the lord or somebody will be like ah he's too much all the time he'll just talk about church stuff so that is an indicator that probably that's not somebody that should be around amen if not you're gonna get influenced matthew chapter four if you're there you can say amen so in malachi the priest's lips should always keep what the word why do you need to keep the word all the matthew time 4 verse 1 thank you lord then was jesus led up of the spirit into the wilderness to be tempted of the devil it was the spirit leading him he didn't put himself in temptation and when he had fasted 40 days and 40 night he was afterward hungry we already explained this the last of the flesh and when the tempter came to him he say if you be the son of god command that this stone be made bread because the son of god had that power amen but he answered and say it is water so when the devil attacked the lord amen the word is automatically ready in the lips of god amen jesus didn't have to sit down and begin to reason about it once you attack the word pop-up amen he is fighting back by the word your fight is by the world [Music] and the devil also fights you by the word so it's a fight of a word against word amen just like a snake against a snake moses have a snake and then the magician have a snake but we know one snake will swallow the other one because the law of the spirit of life is greater than the true snake the law of sin and death so you must make sure you have the right snake you say buddy stephen snake yeah he was that snake that they put on the pole by moses amen praise it be the name of the lord it is written men shall not live by water bread alone but by every word so the first one he establishes the word above everything but by every word that proceeded out of the mouth of who but in malachi the word must be coming out of the mouth of fool amen from god to the priest and we are a kingdom of priest five then the devil takes him up in the holy city and set him on the pinnacle of the temple the pride of life and said to him if you be the son of god cast yourself down because they want people to see in the temple for it is written he shall give his angel charges concerning you the devil is using the word and in their hand they shall bear you up lest at any time you dash your foot against the stone seven jesus said to him get thee behind me satan you see what he fight with it is water back again to the world even though the devil if you notice the devil is the one keep updating himself he started by by stone then he figured out the word came back he said ah this is a different caliber i cannot go with the stuff of life let me turn around and get into his religious world amen he upgraded himself but jesus doesn't need any upgrade he's still ready amen it is written again you shall not tempt the lord yo who was that lord deity right here jesus is god verse 8 again the devil take him up into an exceeding high mountain and shows him the lust of the eyes all the kingdom of the world and the glory of them the lust of the eyes and said to him all these things will i give you if you will fall down and worship me then say jesus to him get you from here satan for it is again the word still back again for it is written you shall worship the lord your god and him only shall you preserve shall you serve everybody clear so far verse 11 then the devil leaves him and below the angel came and minister unto him the fight was word against word and jesus overcome by the word amen and the priest sleeps child should have the word amen that's the way we overcome and that's the example that was given to every single believer that if you can take god at his word then you can defeat the devil anywhere any place under any circumstances it's the word let's go to hebrew chapter four hallelujah we're still dealing with the window of jezebel we needed that window to establish couple things if we can get it down then you will understand the dressing and the high heel and everything and even the man somebody put a question why we don't talk about the man wearing tight pants a problem it's a homosexual spirit amen it is a homosexual spirit a man should not have tight pants something is wrong when you walk and you have to move your feet like this something is off you better change the paint [Music] what is in the man that will attract someone it's amazing how people lack discernment and they swallow everything amen in the old time there was a difference between a watch i'm going to say it and i'm speaking to this church the watch of a man and a watch of a woman amen the men watch were the bigger one what happened in the world that the women's watch looks like men watching instead of even thinking about it meditating on it guess what the sister just take and get it because it's fashion because everybody is doing it and never understood that fashion is the world of the devil because the scripture says you should not conform to the fashion of the world to the present day fashion why did they change the watch of a woman from being small and being beautiful to a to a watch of a woman that looked like a man and sometimes they put it on the right hand you've seen people doing it you take you pick it up and you do it again it is a spirit of homosexuality you can hate me today you will love me in heaven amen it is a spirit of homosexual a watch of a man it's homo it's lesbian that do that because they want to be like a man but they know by nature they are not men so they make certain things to copy a man that's why you begin to see certain shoes of women looking like men a sister should not dress like that you think you're impressing somebody having shoes that look like a man and all they do they put it on a pink collar but if you look it look exactly like a man and then when they go to the mensahs mensah they take the paint off a man and make them tight why the tight paint is on the women's side of the world why is that confusion because on this side is gay on the other side is lesbian so they take stuff and the cross it away and believe her doing it message believer take pen message sister she was looking like a man watch looking like a man and before you know it you're gonna wear shirts that look like a man and they put it pink they say this is for a woman but when you look you reflect a man why do you need that one shirt when god gives you thousands of shirts that look like a sister hebrew chapter four that was a bonus an appetizer for the word of god is what we found that word should be in the priest's mouth jesus fought by the word and hebrew is talking about the word the word of god is quick in other words it's living it's a love it's not a dead word and it's powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword it is more sharper than your knife in the kitchen piercing even to the dividing asunder of the soul and the spirit and of the joint and the marrow why is he piercing and is the discerner the world have discernment there is a power of discernment in the world amen if you want to have discernment cling to the word and the word will be able to discern what is going on and the discerner of the thoughts of the intent of the water how are you gonna know what is in somebody's heart because the bible says no one knows what is in the mind save the spirit which is in the mind how are you gonna know what somebody else is thinking it takes the word and the word what the word tells you is exactly right even though the outside look different the word of god is always true because heaven and earth will pass away but my word will remain forever if the word tells you that wrong no matter how good they look you better trust the word because the word goes beyond what the human can see it goes and discerns the heart how are you going to discern the harlot amen you need the word to discern you that's why we stick by the word that's why we want to do what the word have said because the word will discern the devil it is a discerner of the thoughts and the intent of the heart neither is there any water any creature that is not manifested in other words that is hidden in his sight in other words there is nothing that the word of god cannot penetrate nothing you can act all you want if the living word if christ come down on the scene he will expose exactly what is going on that's why all along he has not been brother stephen he was not brother stephen and it's not gonna be brother stephen it's always been the word of god amen that's why when the word come you say hey that's exactly me how did that know i never live with you i don't go to your house we've never been together how do i know exactly what happened 20 years in your life what happened 30 years in your life what happened five years in your life what happened yesterday in the life it is the living word it is a living being that is going around and telling me talk about this you want to catch this one when you went to the hotel nobody was there how can i come here and preach exactly and say somebody will go to the hotel and do this this is ouch it is not me it is the word amen because nothing there is not any creature that is hidden in his sight but all things are water that's why you don't have to live a life that you're trying to complicate yourself god knows everything you're doing we might not know what you're doing god knows everything better confess it and get it clear and move on because one of this day if you continue on what you're doing he's gonna pick it up and give it to somebody and somebody will wake up either prophesy or come with a dream exactly what you've been doing somewhere but all things are naked and how open to the eyes of who him to the heart to the eyes of him with whom we have to do you're gonna give an account to somebody he already knows everything even what you're doing in your bedroom he knows that's why elisha was able to tell the king of israel what the other king was speaking in the bedroom it was not that elisha was there or have an fbi working over there the greatest fbi that ever been is the holy ghost amen because the holy ghost is a witness and whatever you do so whenever you do something he's there he's just watching you that's why he can report and accuse you because he was there when you were doing it amen blessed be the name of the lord the word in the mouth of the priest the fight of the word against the word staying with the word because the word is the one that defeat the enemy amen now let's pray heavenly father lord we thank you again father for your grace for your love your mercy and for giving us an opportunity to come together lord around the reveal word of the hour lord the door of this human history on this world in this satan edom is pretty much closing out lord father and you are yearning you are begging you are searching father for your seed lord pulling them in the very last hour to get them ready lord for the oncoming rapture that is right ahead lord if there is something that we have done that might be lord father that grieve the holy spirit somehow in our life lord we ask that you forgive us father may nothing be in this building that might be a hindrance lord to this service father we are committing everything unto the hand may the devil and his army be completely sealed out and may only the holy spirit lord father be present tonight to minister to your children and those that are streaming lord as we embley ask him everything in the name of jesus christ amen god bless you you've already been seated let me fix this thing then we will go amen blessed be the name of the lord if you love you watch too much you better evaluate between that and god amen that evaluate between that and god we're not putting you on uh in a prison it is just the spirit of the things there are things that need to be given away and god can give you something better amen he told david if you would have asked me i would have given you rather than going and killing somebody else just because you lost after his own wife amen so god have many things that he can give you than that simple watch that you're trying to hold on because you want to look like everybody king a hazardous fists and esther banquet we're on part 38 amen we were dealing we are still dealing with jezebel on the natural side i believe everybody can still see this the bible says again that when jehu was come to jezreel jezebel heard everything and she painted her face number one she tied her head you already know what it means and number three we are dealing with jezebel looking at the window amen last sunday we talk about the two aspects of the window we talk about a window normally speaking in every house have a window and we also spoke about the window of jezebel everybody remember that and we explained to you that the window of jezebel is a public exposition in the intent to seduce or to vamp or to to bring attraction into somebody or to cause lust amen and the anointing upon jezebel we all know that the anointing upon jezebel is a demonic anointing and we found out on sunday that that anointing not only does seduce the people or entice the people but it's an anointing that also teaches you because we want to find out where did eve learn what she did and we found that eve learn it from the devil and adam learn it from eve so there's an anointing that can be taught it's an anointing that can be taught or can be transferred from one person to another person everybody clear then we found out that by that window came out to portrait everybody remember that there was a portrait of jezebel and there was another portrait of the shulamat amen the portrait of jezebel was in was enhanced with artificial things whether in the book of the song of solomon everything was natural everybody clear but the bible put an accent upon the eyes of both jezebel and her lord and the eyes of the tournament hallelujah in proverbs 6 25 we read last sunday that last night after her beauty which talking about the face because everything that jehu could see was just a portrait on a mirror on a window that's not after her beauty in that heart neither let her take deal with the water i lead in ezekiel 23 40 we found out that when a holla and a holy birth sent men to come to them the bible says that from whom that deed washed themselves that self painted their eyes and decked their self with water so not only did these women learn to paint their eyes to paint their faces amen but they also learn to deck themselves with what with ornament which paul and peter were against it but when we got to the book of salomon we found out that they should not only have one necklace amen song of solomon chapter four be all that affair my love behold thou are fair that i have devised we already explained that that is the spirit the soul of a dove within their locks that hair is as a flock of goat that appear from mangila that has ravaged my heart my sister my spouse that i have ravished my heart with one off than water with one chain of that right here she's decked with a lot of ornament which brother branham said was wrong but over here it was only one chain which one random say something simple in song of solomon chapter six verse five the bible says turn away denies from me for they have overcome me so in the book of the song of solomon what overcome what overcame solomon was the eyes of a dove in other words it was the spirit on the tsunami the character the sweet character of the tsunami was what attracted solomon more than the physical of the woman amen but in jesse belsad jezebel worked more on the natural and she have to entice her natural into an artificial in order to vamp or to seduce a man but a normal woman should be natural but the spirit that you have the anointing that you have should be the one attracting a man because peter says that you should control a man with a meek and quiet spirit everything clear so far blessed be the name of the lord now when we go back into second king verse 9 we found out that when jezebel heard that jew is coming let me put this together then we're going to put it together number one jezebel heard that there is a man coming she heard there is a man coming she heard there is a party coming amen number two she fits herself to meet that man number two she fix herself to meet the man or the next victim amen number three she talks she asked a question she said head zimri had peace when she meets you she's going to first appear to you as a peaceful woman like somebody who's bringing you all that you wanted in life that peace woman that you are looking for amen number four she places herself in a way that she can capture the men she strategically herself in a spot that man can see her clearly because the bible says that when jihoo enter in the gate she said had zimri had peace who slew his master in other words she made peace with criminals and he jihu lift up his face to the window how did jezebel know that jehu will come through that direction and she positioned herself in a direction that is gonna meet exactly the next victim everybody clear and number four number five was once the victim identified her corner then she's gonna seduce you with her eyes and whatever she did to her face and her beauty amen number one she heard that a man was coming number two when she heard that somebody's coming she fixed herself according to the occasion and then she appears first to be peaceful but she's not peaceful and she's gonna place herself in a strategic place that you don't miss her and number three four and number five once you approach and you bite debate then she begin to work on you anybody clear so far amen in john chapter 4 verse 3 whatever the devil does you know it's a copy of of what jesus does the bible says in john chapter 4 verse 3 that when jesus left judea and deported again into galilee he was going to galilee he must need to go through water there was something about the lord jesus christ that was pressing him to go into samaria why was he going into samaria why did jezebel approaching the window then come here to a city of samaria which is called cesar near the parcel of grant that jacob gave to his son joseph now jacob's where was dead jesus therefore being weary tired with his journey sat does on the water jesus was felt that he must go into samaria but even though he felt that he needed to go to the city of samaria he didn't go in any other places of samaria he went into a strategic place he could have went into the gate of the city he could have went into the marketplace he could have went into the king palace but he chose to go in the well why in the world who was coming in the world why did jezebel went into the window who was coming that must face the window everybody cleared so far and it was about the sixth hour there come a woman of water to joe water so somehow jesus heard just like jezebel heard that jesus was coming jesus also heard that the woman was coming just like jezebel has to position herself in a strategic place jesus also have to position himself in a strategic place to meet this next victim hallelujah in john 5 19 the bible says that jesus answered and said unto them verily verily i say unto you the son can do water nothing of himself but what he sees the water in other words whatever move jesus does he always does a move after he was given a vision so when jesus said i must go through samaria he was not just going through samaria they sent him an uber text they told him there is a client somewhere there and jesus received the uber tax and he went to that address that the father gave it to him because he must pick up a seed of abraham and take that seed all the way to destination ever cleared so far he said i do nothing of himself but what he sees the father do for what things so ever he does there also judah son likewise he already have a text of uber they gave him the address they said there is a client that you need to pick up he said but father i'm going all my way to jerusalem he said no no no no no no there is another address you go to the city of samaria the address is in sasha when you get there go by the well and just station there and your next client is coming up everybody clear so far and jessica when she heard that she who was coming she also prepared himself and she stationed himself and she knew somebody was coming everybody cleared so far in god manifesting his gift to brother branham say the father sent him up there where did brother branham get that you know he was on his road how many knows he was on his wall to jericho and jericho is just below jerusalem but he never need to go by the father sent him up there he got an uber message he said i do nothing till the father shows me saint john 5 19 i do nothing until i see the father do it first that is what he said the message is perfectly in line with the scripture amen and when he approached when the woman began to approach he was not a surprise to jesus when jew approaches jezebel it was not a surprise for jezebel amen they have now to interact together but jezebel was relying upon her beauty to juice amen the portrait of jezebel amplifies the beauty yes but the portrait of solomon amplifies the spirit of a woman if it's beauty what about christ isaiah 53 verse 2 for he shall grab before him as a tender plant and as a root out of a joy ground he has no water no water and when he shall see him there is no water that you should water what attracted the tsunami was not beauty christ positioned himself but he projected the messiahic sign he projected the supernatural and the supernatural is what catches the fish [Applause] hallelujah that's why paul said that the gospel must be preached with the demonstration of the spirit he said i come not with word of enticing but with the power and the death monstration because that's what attracted the tournament when the shooter man look he said give me water if you notice he is the one that started to talk to his victim it was jezebel that started to talk before jehu speak give me water and she look number one he's not beautiful i already have father number two he's a jew and i am a samaritan amen god shows a skin different than what you want to bring you the gospel amen but despite the blockage of the beauty because there was no beauty in christ despite the problem of the skin the tsunami i mean the woman everywhere could go beyond the skin beyond the beauty and understand things that the pharisees the preacher missed [Music] hallelujah a woman of samaria to joe water jesus said unto her give me to drink for his disciples were gone away unto the city to buy meat he was hungry then said the woman of samaria unto him how is it that that being a jew asked to drink of me which i am a woman of samaria for the jews have no dealing with the water how are you gonna catch a woman like this number one she was a prostitute number two you are not even beautiful number three you are also a jew and there is no dealing between the jews and the samaritan you need more than beauty you need more than racial issue you need the spirit of the living god you need a spirit a character that is gonna be the salt that's gonna attract the believer and they're gonna trust to be like you that is what you attract a man that is what you attract a young woman that is what you attract your co-worker that is what you attract your husband that is what you attract your wife that is your greatest weapon is a living life of christ it will defeat the devil everywhere anytime under any circumstances hallelujah you know samson was a type of jesus christ and samson have the seven lots but there was in a forest a lion that lion may be killed a zebra that lion may be killer go to that lion maybe kill an elephant but one day that lion faces samson amen samson never used his physical power the bible said the spirit of the lord came upon him it was a living word he was the anointing upon the seven lord he was the message with the holy ghost that is what will kill the lion hallelujah you want to catch a believer it is not just the message you need the word and the spirit then the message is alive and the bible says samson took the lion and kill him like a goat hallelujah that was the end of the reign of the lion we have many lions in the message amen we need a message with the spirit to tell down the lion the lion the lion character they lie on nature where you bite everybody you kill everybody you are the one roaring you are the one ruling you are the one dominating you must face your samson you must face the lord jesus christ so he can tear you down hallelujah and do you know when the lion was killed what came out of iron do you want a hand in your life christ must destroy you hallelujah and samson say when they asked samson he said out of there either came water you who used to destroy people out of the one that was eating came out sweetness that's the sweetness you need to move on with your life hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord let's go to proverbs 5. our life are still expressing something i mean lions nature we are king we roaring everybody must shut up amen when you stomp your feet nobody can talk a lion anointing amen you must face samson they can kill you jump you dead and you die on your own self then honey can come out of you amen do you know who found that honey the same one that killed him the same christ will come back again and say let me investigate that victim when he takes her this he will say yeah this is what i was looking for now that's my daughter now that's my son now that's my servant now you can go ahead and serve others hallelujah let's go to proverbs chapter 5. [Music] it gets so milky here amen jezebel heard a man coming jezebel fixing herself for the next victim jezebel bringing peace jezebel placing herself on the spot jezebel seducing and she's the one that start talking proverbs chapter 5. i need to handle proverbs 7. if we finish it then we'll be good to get to the next stage proverb 5 verse 2. you there that damn regard discretion that word is not discretion the correct word there is discernment amen let's go to verse one so you understand my son attained my wisdom and by your ears to my understanding that you marry regard discernment why do you need discernment why do you need discernment brother branham says now in discernment of the body of the lord now our eternal destination is not altogether determined by what we see or what we do what there's two words there the first is see and the other one is here amen this one can bring even faith but we sin that the eyes overcome the other senses amen because that's where the devil worked with so you must see things you might hear things that's not the deal the problem is the discernment you have about what you hear and what you see that's what's going to save you but when i'm saying our eternal destination is not altogether determined by what we see and what we hear but it's determined on what discernment we have of what we see and what we hear everybody here so that's why solomon said number one you must have discernment but the discernment comes by the word of god the living word verse two that you may regard discretion discernment and that your leap may keep water why does your lip need to keep knowledge knowledge of what knowledge of the world remember the priest in zechariah you must have though jesus fought by them and solomon said my son i want you to be equipped and the equipment i want you to have one you must have discernment with you and number two i want the word of god to be on your lips i want you to be what god told the priest in malachi 2 7 to be why do you need these two elements yet the discernment and the word the discernment come by the word ever clear why first three father everybody clear are you watching your bible for the lips of the strange woman drop us honeycomb very sweet and her mouth is sweeter than water it's smoother than water oil in other words i want you to have discernment and i want your word when they say mouth it's automatically speaking about heart because out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks in other words you must have the word of god because when you face a strange woman when you face a prostitute whether a natural prostitute or a spiritual church that is a prostitute like jezebel they fight by the world their mouth is smoother than oil their lips job honeycomb they uses the power of the world so you must be also prepared to have the word in your mouth that's why when jesus faces the devil the devil started by the word and jesus was the word made flesh so he could respond by the word and it was a fight of the word against the word that's why solomon said keep the word why because it will be handy when you face a wrong woman it will be important when you face a wrong church you gonna fight them with the word because they're gonna fight you with their word everybody clear so far hallelujah let's go first forward but her hand is bigger than what it's bitter than warm wood sharp as a two-water the end of this woman is bitter bitter the beginning is sweet you okay are you in hurry the beginning a is sweet sweet like what like honey everybody here but the end be is what be there be there like water but robert called it be there like water warm wood and what else and shopping like what why the mic you got it amen when we read the hebrew fold when we read evil form the word of god is water sharper than water so this woman has a sword everybody clear this woman has a sword remember when the antichrist spirit came out with the white horse rather he had a ball but he didn't have arrow you remember when he changed to the red horse rather what did he heard he had water do you know that or you want me to read it you want me read it you already know that right he had the sword so this woman is anointed with the sword of the devil that's why the catholic church in jezebel in the tartarian church that is what jezebel was mentioned that is the age when the catholic church begin to kill people because her she starts sweet on the first seal but on the second seal she's getting a sword she's going to change horses everybody clear and whatever the devil do is a copy because if you go in revelation 10 when the book was given to john when john ate the book he was first how well sweet as what but when the book got into the bell it was water it was bitter and then revelation 10 8 says now you must do what they saw did i lose anybody number one sweet ass honey to be bidder and three see sharper like a two-edged sword john come and pick up the book when he pick up the book when he eat it sweet as honey when he got to the belly be there then john you must what professor you must use the sword the prophetic sword and you must fight with it because that's the way they are not fight that's why brother branham said we have the devil elsewhere hallelujah because the sword will discern for you anybody clear so far everybody awake let's continue hallelujah verse 5 have feet go down to what you see the pet horse now you have the first horse right there you have the second one with a sword look how he's changing horses in the book of proverbs at the opening of the seventh seal the bible becoming you amen her feet goes down to death herself has stepped take hold of water if you open the fourth seal you will see that death and water you see that praise god verse six last you ponder the path of her life her ways are water in other words her ways are unstable are you there if she sit quiet you're gonna catch her that's why she keeps flipping amen she's like a chameleon today she's red tomorrow she change again amen because if she remains solid you're gonna catch her that's why the antichrist was changing horses today it's a white horse tomorrow it's a red horse tomorrow is a black horse another time it's a pale horse but christ have only one wealth and he never changes he's only on a white horse it is written it is written it is written it is written it is written it is the anti-class changing because her ways are movable they can flip at the beginning they sweet a white horse rather after a while you get her to the house she got pregnant that's it then she pulled the sword are you there at the beginning sweet no problem when she got pregnant she take you to the court then paul you're going to pay child support then there her her color showed up there is no sweetness it becomes water that keeps there become bitter are you there her ways are movable unstable that you cannot know them you are not trained in this area don't follow them verse seven hear me therefore all you children ever clear young people hear me and depart not from the word of my water he didn't say depart not from the word do you see that but depart not from the word of my men shall not live by but by every that proceed is out of mind in other words depart not from the spoken word stay tight with the message stay tucked with the spoken word depart not my son my children the children of god depart not from the message because that is your protection against the harlot [Applause] not depart not from my word because the word can be the bible but the spoken word which is the living word the spoken word is the original seed depart not from the spoken word you need that living word it is all written in the book of of uh proverbs everybody clear verse 8 remove you he move your way far from water in other words be really really separated stay away from that that's why brother branham say it is not as much as you can get closer to sin but as you can get away from sin sin is not something you play around with him before you know it you're gonna find yourself in it so you don't get closer to sin see in other words my son stay away have no dealings with this amen stay away from her and come not near the water after what don't even get near the door because as you approaching near to her door you're already in the wrong way because her door has a way there is a way that goes to her house so if you go already at the door that means you're already in her path amen so stay away from there everybody clear praise the name of the lord now let's go to proverbs 7. amen wow it's amazing how time flies proverbs 7 verse 4 if you dare you can say amen if we can get this down praise god hallelujah say to wisdom you are my sister you already know this and call understanding your king's woman that they may keep you from the water we already seen that in fact from the strange we flatter off with the water that's why my son keep the word ready because it's a fight of word against word anybody clear for the at the window we seen this on sunday of my house i looked through my casement and beheld among the simple one i discern among the water among the youth if a youth sleeping in church something is wrong buddy i discern among the youth i discern among the youth a young man void of water understanding this young man everybody is born shaping sin shepherd born in sin shaping iniquity coming into the world speaking lies amen but this young man is void of understanding we explain to you that he was not connected with christ he was just a young man naive yet still sinner because he's not born again yet amen and when you are sinner you are not born again if you notice the bible didn't say a baby the bible didn't say a toddler the bible says that this young man was already a youth he was a young man when they say a young man it means that this young man is not under the age of accountability in other words the black dog has been releasing his life but he has not met christ yet make sense because when you're under the age of accountability we explain it to you then the black dog is locked that's why you can find a five years old you give them a hug they don't feel nothing you can't hug at six years old they don't feel nothing you can have my little sister there she's not gonna feel anything because she's because the black dog is completely blocked but if they turn to be teenager if you touch them there will be something in your body and there will be something in her body but i'm saying if nothing happens something is wrong with you if you normal and you have free you're gonna feel something what you're feeling is the black dog it's telling you that the black dog is awake in other words when you touch that black dog goes like that's what it is and you say oh i felt something no it's the black dog that you failed amen so this young man right here is a youth he the black dog has been released but he's void of understanding you know what wisdom and understanding is already the bible say in romans 6 here i speak after the manner of men because of the infirmity of your water the black dog for as we have yielded your members servant to uncleanness and to iniquity unto iniquity even so now yield your member servant to righteousness and to water you were working for the black dog romans 7 5 for when we were in the water the motion of water it's the black dog pushing the young people they just can't help it it's just the black dog remember in ezekiel 16 that's why christ come and say let me help you fight this battle let me help you cross this other this this adolescent edge with you you're going to go through fire but i'm going to be in the midst of fire to take the heat off the fire so the fire doesn't burn you for when we were in the flesh the motion of sin the black dog which were by the law because they told you don't do it don't do it don't do it yet the black dog take opportunity by the commandment amen did work in our member to bring you fruit and to water everybody clear so far so this young man void of understanding he doesn't understand anything he's not connected to christ and because of that the motion of sex begin to work with him and now he's driven by the black dog this is written between the line now let's go back passing through the street near her water what did solomon say in prophet father stay away look at this boy he's already in the corner of this prostitute how did he get there the motion of simon how did you get to open the computer and find yourself into a pornography it is the motion of sin it is telling you the black dog is working on you that's why you find yourself in the wrong website you didn't go just like that somebody pushes you it's a black dog amen because he needs something to feed on and the more and and and the indian chiefs say they want to feed the most is the one that is going to do what overcome the black inside black inside you just feeding both of them everybody clear and passing through the street near her corner and he went the way to her water when solomon said don't even get closer to her door this boy is going there why he's not connected to christ he doesn't have the wisdom that will tell him don't go that route now he's driven by passion anybody clear in the twilight in the evening in the black and the night and the dark night it always happened at night why did it happen tonight amen job chapter 24 verse 15 the eye also of the adulterer whether for the water they want to do stuff when people don't see them sneaking saying no i shall see me and disguises his water that's why you go to downtown you find the young men in the message when they're in downtown they're not going to wear a tie they're going to change their apparel and put i mean a hat like this so if somebody's passing there brother robert is over there he's not going to know that this is so-and-so i was driving one time in night in uh in the in downtown going to the hospital to see somebody and i look and who here was a message believer with his young man going there he didn't know i was going to the hospital at night packed in downtown here is a message believer amen and also the eye of an adulterer whether for the twilight saying no man no i shall see me and disguise his face in the water remember what solomon says here everybody in the dark they dig through the water they're just approaching at night to the houses which they have water so at the day they know there's a beautiful woman there there is a beautiful woman there there is a beautiful woman there at night now they're going through it was apartment to see apartment 2. are you there which they have marked for themselves in the daytime they know not the water there is no connection with the light there is no connection with the world there is no connection with a living god for the morning is to them even as the shadow of god of death if one know them they are in terror of the shadow of death when it's daylight they don't like it if you catches them they're like god bless you brother you like come come down god bless you because you caught him he's in the terror of death anybody clear so far so and behold verse 10 damn made him a woman with the appearance of water with the attire the clothing of a harlot and a stubble and a subtle heart a subtle heart brother branham himself and seed says this the serpent is that missing person between the chimpanzee and the man because listen notice this now that the serpent was not a reptile he was the most saddened of all beasts of the field now i went and got dictionaries today from everywhere to look up this word what the word saddle mean it means to be water to be water the best interpretation of the hebrew is maha means having a true knowledge of the principle of water keep this when we're going to see how was the woman former anybody clear so this woman is smart smarter than you she is crafty and her heart not only it's a wisdom and craftiness of the devil but she have the true knowledge of the principle of life she knows life better than you she's more experienced bro solomon say i found more beaded than what the water the woman whose water remember this woman the heart is shadow whose heart is a snare and neck and her hand as water who so do what shall escape from but there this boy the sinner he's not born yet but the sinner shall be taken by water that's why the boy is going with that restraint because he's still a sinner everybody but to escape her you must do what you must please god how do you please god first corinthians chapter 10 but with many of them god was not well what for they were overthrown in they died let us therefore feel lest a promise being left of us of entering into his water which is the holy ghost any of you should seem to come short of it for unto us was the gospel preached as well as unto them but the word preached did not profit them not being mixed with what in them the water that's why we preach certain things here and people don't change [Applause] we demonstrated by the bible nails are wrong we demonstrated by the message nails are wrong why you don't want to catch your nail we demonstrated by the scripture and we showed you that painting is wrong cutting hair is wrong we demonstrated that young men should not wear bracelet yet they are people that are part of this church they still do the same thing that we are preaching we are demonstrating by the scripture by the message but it looks like it's not helping them because what they hear is not mixed with faith it's an intellectual knowledge amen hebrew 11 but without water it is what impossible to do what if the one who avoids the prostitute must please god it means that that person must have water and faith is a revelation that's why brother branham said the new birth is a revelation you must be born again you must have a personal revelation of jesus christ for yourself that's what's going to give you power to overcome the devil not intellectual faith intellectual faith they give you quote they give you god you still have questions you still have questions you still have questions you still have questions they give you the bible you still reason you still reason you still reason you still reason we are not here to please your reasoning we are here to preach your heart hallelujah we are not teaching you here we are not demonstrating things here to please your knowledge we are devastating the ministry of the resurrection because after the resurrection of jesus christ the bible says our heart did burn when he opened the scripture we are opening the scripture to touch your heart [Applause] the holy ghost is working in the bible and the message to impress your heart your heart must burn not your head if not you want to miss this ministry [Applause] and you're going to look it like it's brother stephen you're going to miss god [Music] any reason you can stay at home but you can go anywhere and we keep preaching we keep preaching and people don't want to listen they're sick they will go to work sick they're sick they don't want to come to church sick they even forget that we can pray for you here and you can get here that faith is no longer there you feel more coronavirus than even the power of god sit at home on the couch and put it in if there is a legitimate reason you work understand my brother i understand that but i'm talking about that that small group that's still lingering that's the holy spirit keep hammering hallelujah so but without faith it is impossible to please god for he that cometh to god must believe that he is and that is the rewarder of them that do what diligently seek him to escape this woman you must please god anybody clear so far i only have 10 minutes left let me run before somebody lose a wing number 11 she is what i keep number 10 i will come back to the attire of harlot as we're going to demonstrate how the woman was created in eden amen because you will understand if i if if i go through the high here without you getting that you're going to miss something and behold verse 10 they made him a woman with the attire of water and the subtle water if you notice here keep it for future reference the heart of this woman is expressed on the outside by her attire keep that in mind the woman have a bad attire and her heart also is what bad in other words her heart is demonstrated by her clothing remember that because i'm gonna go through clothing in detail okay clothing for young men clothing for the women okay verse 11 she's loud and what she is not quiet [Laughter] oh my god you didn't choose the wrong church you choose the right one to change you she is quiet she is loud and white that stubbornness is not submission is not submissive amen the woman is a harlot bad heart and her behavior she is loud she's not quiet i'm sorry she's loud and she is stubborn let's deal with florida and stubborn anybody clear clear the bible says here knowing not that your body are the members of a craft cross shall i then take the member of christ and make them the member of huato we are talking about the hollow what knowing not that he which joined to a harlot is what either you're going to be joined with christ by the or you want to be joined by a harlot for do say he shall be what evil either you're going to be one flesh with christ or one flesh with the harlot but he that is john unto the lord is one spirit that's why the one who's joined with the lord by the new birth you will escape the harlot because you already won with christ amen flee fornication everything that a man does is without the body but he that committed fornication significance his own body in other words you are also uh polluting your own body everybody clear the bible say likewise peter your wife being water penis is recommending the women to be submissive but the woman in proverbs 7 is stubborn opposite of peter be seen subjection to your own husband that if any obey not we already explained this they also without the work we are without the word be born be warned by the conversation of the wife why they behold your chest conversation your life couple with fear whose adorning let it not be the outward adorning of the plating of water when we explain you the planting of hair in that time was the attire of harlot you understand now in other words peter is telling you do not dress yourself like a prostitute of your time because the planning of her hair was the harlot of the time of peter but today we are not in the time of pity but the word stays true the message there is don't worry closing that looks like a woman on the street in your time [Music] are you there and wearing of gold and putting on off apparel we explained this but let it be the hidden man of the water that's what we're impressing in that which is not corruptable even the ornament of a water and a water a meek and white this woman is water make sense the portrait of the shooting might is a dove it's a meek and quiet spirit but this one is a wolf you hear her at night whoo you know that it's a wolf amen it's a make an acquired spirit which is in the sight of god of a great water that's what god is looking at not a loud and a stubborn spirit but the meek and the submissive spirit everybody clear revelation chapter two we see this on sunday notwithstanding i have a few things against thee because that suffers that woman jezebel which called herself a what she is a prophetess if a pro a prophetess to do what she is not quiet she's speaking she teaches makes sense which cheese which teaches to and to seduce my servant to commit fornication and to eat things sacrifice unto others this jezebel woman is a teacher this woman in proverbs is loud she speaks she's not quiet but paul says the woman must be what silence but she is let the woman learn in what the prophet woman is welcome let the woman learn in silence without water she is loud and welcome opposite better suffer not a woman to do what what does jesus do is the word clear no to observe authority over there but to be in water she is louder she want to preach the gospel that's what you have in denominational world let your women keep water in water for it is not permitted upon them to do what this one is loud she wanna preach and when she preached she take the attitude like amen let her stand there jezebel but they are commanded to be underwater she's stubborn us also say the word if you were against paul you must be against moses because he was already speaking in the law for if they will learn anything let them ask their husband at home for it is a shame for women to do whatever she is water loud in church you want to preach you want to teach what came the word of god at from you oh came it unto you only the word come to the prophet if any man fake himself to be a water not a prophetess or spiritual let him acknowledge not let him let him acknowledge that the things that are right unto you are the commandment of what that's why paul say a woman should not preach but jezebel promote women preachers anybody clear so far let's go down she is loud and stubborn her feet a bad knot in her water tattoos two verse four that they may teach the young women to be sober to love their husband to love their children to be discreet chase and what does she stay a humble opposite everybody clear verse 12 now she is without now in the street and lies in the water lies in water remember jesus lies in weight for the for the woman anyway you remember jezebel did what lies in wait for the next victim anybody clear she lies he wed in weight at every corner verse 13. so she caught him she's the one engaging who caught joseph the wife of potiphar you see so she called him and did what and kiss him with an important face a face that have no shame she's bold you're going to see that in isaiah 3 when we get to the high heels look at peter in like money also that women have done themselves in modest water with water this one her face is well impudent this one shame fitness everybody clear not with breaded hair we already seen that but with which becometh women professing goldiness with good work jeremiah 3 3 therefore the shower has been withholding and there has been another rain and that has a water a prostituted forehead in other words a prostituted face how is a prostituted face you have a whole forehead that refuses to be what prostitute another shame that's why you see them working the way they walk and they dress wrong because that anointing take the shame of a woman away everybody clear she kissed him and with an important face she said to him verse 14 i have water when jezebel met jiho what did she heard makes sense now position herself just like this woman and then peace that's the beginning i have peace offering with me this day have i paid my water so when you talk to these women they understand that you're a christian boy they will begin to ask you questions about the bible they will begin to talk to you about religious things oh yeah i go to church too i love the bible i love the scripture too they have peace offering you see you you meet a young man no no no no he's a good young man yeah he's not in the message but he's good when i talk to him he always talk about the bible the stuff he's talking about the bible because he already learned you he already understood you and he knows to get you he must start with a peace offering that's him we have peace i'm going with a peace offering having the form of godliness but denying the very message that you believe he doesn't want women that wear long dresses but he loves you he deny what you give you the force but he wants to talk to you so he's going to bring you peace offering at first that woman will start peaceful with you yeah i have a question in the bible what about this this this and you there oh message believer let me catch her he lets me catch the fish and you start no look at the bible look oh yes i like you different

there i have i have decked my bed with covering of tapestry with calf work we find linen of water not the righteousness of the scent but the righteousness of the world you know people judge people so much the bible say do not judge that's the righteousness of the world you know when i sleep sometime i feel funny feelings i thought we were talking about religious stuff no more bible question amen attack my bed verse 17 i have perfumed my bed with water and water and what i will skip this but go to to psalm 45 and look what what is the perfume of jesus the only difference jesus have uh jesus have mer alos and cassia she has mer allows and cinnamon very close anybody claire it's in psalm 45 you can read it at home come let us take a feel of love until the water let us so lost ourselves with love i thought she was religious she has peace offering right for the water the water do you know what good man means my husband she's a married woman for the good man is not a worker that is not around he is gone on a water it is a married woman but the husband left her and went to a long journey give me grace mark 13 for the son of man is as a man taking a what who left his water are you there she is jezebel of revelation 17 she's called the queen of heaven she's saying she's married to christ but christ have left and went into a faraway journey are you following me i'm almost about to finish let me lay this down then brother daryl pick up and then we will come back and get to genesis again amen for the good man is not a home my husband is not there we can do it there's nothing bad i'm a christian too you're a christian there's nothing wrong with it this is my own opinion are you there for the husband is not a home he's gone a long journey verse 20. he has taken a water a bag of money with him and will come home at the water there is a day that jesus will return there is an appointed day for the rapture i know about the rapture i am a christian too but we can do this are you there the husband is gone jesus don't mind if we do something like this it won't hurt you amen she wanted this she want to polluted you against the second coming she is against the second coming and in her house there was a bag of money brother robert but the husband when he left his home when a cabal was written into her door when the glory of the lord departed from that church the husband took the bag of money hallelujah hallelujah brother branham i can be just as happy with 25 cents in my hand as i could with a loaf of bread in my hand brother branham said if somebody's hungry they're hungry and they say i'm hungry i'm hungry if you come you say what do you want to eat and hamburger how much is this five dollars if you gave them five dollars they got the substance and they are already happy and with five dollars just like they got a humble girl all they have to do is they just need to walk to the store that's how something is why i got the purchase power of the loaf of bread the money is the purchase power of what you need the only thing i have to do is walk over there at the store and get me a loaf of bread but now right now i got the purchase power of the loaf of bread he buys the loaf of bread that is what so fair fees the money so when the husband left home he removed faith from that church you cannot be born in that denomination can you please give me a few minutes hallelujah faith never look and say i don't feel any better i don't see any better i don't hear any better he rejoices because you already got the purchasing power of your healing you are just as happy just as well as anything that you already got because you got the purchase price or fed which is what so when the husband left home he removed faith because the woman is a prostitute and the woman is telling you in this house we don't have faith we don't believe those kind of stuff that you believe because the husband will come at the appointed time amen locating he shall come he shall not give and shall not god avenge his own word which cry day and night unto him do he bear wrong with them i tell you that he will avenge them speedily nevertheless when the son of man comes shall he find what the coming of the lord he needs money but money was removed from that woman but she knows that the husband will come at an appointed time but there is no faith now that is the question here is where i want to get you in revelation 10 we shall get into it a few minutes to another scripture verse in the days of the message of the seven angel the mystery of god ought to be finished here is the question if you follow in that line in this hour will it will it be finished will i found water will malachi 4 be water [Music] the faith was removed from the home because there is a larger coming to restore water faith but the young man took a wrong road where there is no faith hallelujah hallelujah i can't get to this it's still unfolding verse 21 with ma with her much first pitch she calls him to do what the word fight by the world he can't fight back because he doesn't have the word that's why they are overcoming him with flattering of her lips she did what because the young man cannot fight back he goes after her immediately as the knox goes to the slaughter or as a fool to the correction of stock tiller water struck to his liver and as a bird hastened to the snare and no not that it's for his life hearken to me therefore all you children and i tend to the word you children and i tend to the word of my mouth to the spoken word let not your heart decline to her way go not astray in her path for she cast down many water that's why she's drunk with the blood of the martyr yeah many strong men have been slayed for her her house is the way to water going down into the chambers of water to the liberty from the strange woman even from the stranger which flattered with her word which forsaken the god of her water jeremiah 3 therefore the shower has been withholded and there has no ladder rain and that has a whole forehead that refuses to be ashamed will that not from this time cry unto me my father da art the guide of what she forsaken the god of her youth she had forsaken her father she has disrespected the head are you there the young men disrespected the head how glorious will that little branch that escape all these things it shall be holy unto the lord in that day when the real genuine born-again women know their place though they be laughed at and call silly and old-fashioned everything but act like a woman like a lady stand like a lady dress like a lady talk like a lady and live like her let's tender [Applause] appreciate you allowing time to get to proverbs seven two women to portray the emphasize is on the spirit the answer facades is on the natural she's a prophetess i gave you all the detail of a prostitute completely and how she's approaching and how she attacked now lord willing when we get to genesis we're going to see what is going on when the woman was formed because brother branham said she was designer what our design means to a woman let's pray heavenly father lord we thank you again for your grace your love your mercy father and for speaking to us tonight lord i'm sorry i went to lu to be just a little bit above but i wanted to reach a point rather than stopping in the middle and coming back to this where we can load further progress with the church and i know the speed was a little bit too quick but father you the holy spirit that can help them even when they are home they can review this sermon and catch what we didn't have even time to explain more but you are the inside teacher that can give them above all that we can even think and ask lord father may you help this church like we stated there are many things that you are opening and you are opening the scripture to change our heart because the core the beginning of everything started from the heart once the heart has been turned and converted onto you alone father then everything else being begin to cease and father the worshiper once purged there is no more desire for sin lord may you help those that are still lingering under the stubborn spirit and they don't want to hear they're still reasoning they're still pushing their reason above the word of god father knowing deep in their heart that what we're preaching is right and what they're doing is wrong lord father that spirit of stubbornness has been blocking many people from getting their blessings low many women have been found under that spirit lord though they cannot express that outwardly but behind doors with their husband they're still battling this spirit lord and father it's blocking even the moving of the holy spirit because they're trying to control and hold on to their own ways and do not want to surrender but you the god of simpson lord you're the god that can tear a lion like a kid's lord father may you be merciful and by your grace may the hand of love father tear every shell that the unbelief spirit have worked around every complexes that have been lord father handed down from the families and from the society that we grew up lord father that keep reasoning and fighting against the world father they are claiming their own right because laodicea your prophet told us that it's people's right lord but as a lamb may we understand that we need to surrender those right lord to the awesome lamb of god that came and died for us lord father may you touch each one lord minister and remember the need lord father of this church as we commit everything unto the hand
