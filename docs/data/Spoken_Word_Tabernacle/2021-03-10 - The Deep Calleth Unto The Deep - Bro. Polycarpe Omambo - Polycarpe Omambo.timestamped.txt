[5:39] god bless you all this evening this song
[5:42] we're going to do first is the one that
[5:44] uh
[5:44] andrew on sunday he was talking about it
[5:47] and i heard it before but i didn't
[5:49] necessarily know it so
[5:51] over the last couple days i've been
[5:53] listening to it trying to learn it
[5:54] [Music]
[5:56] and i believe brother branham talked
[5:59] about it as well it was a song that
[6:00] andrew said brother brandon mentioned
[6:02] a sister saying it and he enjoyed it and
[6:04] it took everything in him to stay calm
[6:07] and to keep in his seat so i figured
[6:08] we'd start the service with it this
[6:10] this evening and as always don't be
[6:12] afraid to worship don't
[6:14] pray the praise
[6:20] all day angels are watching over me my
[6:25] lord
[6:27] all night all day
[6:31] angels watching over me
[6:34] and when i went down to
[6:37] pray angels are watching over me my lord
[6:42] my
[6:43] soul got happy and i stayed all day

[7:23] sit all night
[7:26] all day angels are watching over me my
[7:32] lord all night
[7:35] all day angels watching over
[7:39] and then like andrew was talking about
[7:41] when satan sends false teachers my way
[7:45] angels are watching over me my lord
[7:49] when he sends teachers to lead me astray
[7:54] angels watching over me one more time
[7:57] when satan sends false teachers my way
[8:02] angels will watch it over amen
[8:12] watching over me one more time all night
[8:14] stay all night
[8:17] all day angels are watching over me my
[8:22] lord all night all day

[9:10] a year ago
[9:11] lord where the doors were shut on us and
[9:13] we had to have church at home
[9:15] lord in that season of my life it was a
[9:17] struggle lord and i felt
[9:19] a drought in my spiritual walk because i
[9:21] wasn't able to be in the service

[9:25] opportunity now to be in your service

[10:00] in jesus name amen amen
[10:04] thank you lord before this next song
[10:10] thank you
[10:10] [Applause]
[10:13] before this next song i just wanted to
[10:15] share this with the
[10:16] with the church um i had a friend
[10:20] call me and he said his dad was getting
[10:22] onto him about playing video games and
[10:24] said it was wrong because his dad is
[10:26] pretty hardcore as as some would say and
[10:29] he was telling he was he was calling me
[10:31] he was like man like what do you think
[10:33] do you think it's wrong to play games
[10:34] and a lot of people when they come to me
[10:36] with questions like that like is it
[10:37] wrong to play video games is it wrong to
[10:39] do this is it wrong to do that
[10:40] i mean i once like i always say brother
[10:43] shango you can correct me if i'm wrong
[10:44] but
[10:45] i didn't want to give them an answer of
[10:46] whether yes it's wrong or yes it's right
[10:48] or whatever
[10:49] um i more so i asked them i said well
[10:52] what are you spending all your time
[10:53] on because am i going to tell you you're
[10:56] wrong for pulling out your phone and
[10:58] playing a simple phone game
[11:01] maybe not but if you're playing phone
[11:03] game after phone game or getting on a
[11:04] playstation or
[11:06] an xbox and that's all you're doing
[11:09] then it's it's gonna be a hindrance in
[11:11] your walk and i believe the lord was
[11:13] just
[11:13] using me because i really didn't know
[11:15] what to say to him but the lord was just
[11:16] using me and he gave me a thought when i
[11:18] was talking to him
[11:19] and i thought about how we can all be
[11:22] faithful with our ties
[11:23] you know we work and if it wasn't for
[11:25] god we wouldn't have the strength to
[11:27] work we wouldn't have the strength to
[11:28] make money
[11:29] so we give god back ten percent which is
[11:32] a small number
[11:33] and then we're we're also supposed to
[11:34] offer so say we offer five
[11:36] ten percent whatever it is say fifteen
[11:38] percent and tithe and offering
[11:39] i was telling them i was like if you
[11:41] think about it god gave us the strength
[11:43] to work
[11:44] gave us the strength to make money so we
[11:46] get back 15
[11:47] but god gives us our life each day of
[11:50] our life he gives us every morning that
[11:52] we get up
[11:52] if it wasn't for him we wouldn't be
[11:54] alive we wouldn't be in health we
[11:55] wouldn't be in strength
[11:57] so then i i was telling him and i'm
[11:59] saying this to me too
[12:00] most of all i told him i said what if we
[12:02] tithed and offered 15
[12:04] of our time i said do i do that i was
[12:07] like if i'm honest with myself i don't
[12:08] know out of 24 hours out of the day
[12:11] we're not just talking about when you're
[12:12] awake we're talking about the entire day
[12:14] the 24 hours
[12:15] what's 10 15 of that and are we spending
[12:18] that amount of time with god
[12:20] and i started i started to get convicted
[12:22] in myself i'm like lord forgive
[12:24] me because what do you think god desires
[12:27] more
[12:27] your money or your time time spent with
[12:30] him and i started
[12:31] like i said i just felt convicted in my
[12:32] heart so you all keep me in prayer
[12:34] it's my desire to start trying to give
[12:36] god at least 10
[12:38] if not 15 of my time every single day
[12:41] reading praying in the morning listening
[12:42] to his prophet throughout the day
[12:43] reading and praying at night
[12:45] and if you think about it 10 15 of 24
[12:49] hours is not 30 minutes it's not an hour
[12:51] it's it's
[12:52] it's a couple hours and i think lord
[12:54] that's my desire
[12:56] i don't yes i can pay my tithe in my
[12:58] offering but am i jipping you and my
[13:00] my quality time spent with you because
[13:02] it's my desire to spend more time with
[13:03] him so that's why i was sharing with him
[13:04] i was like
[13:05] before you ask questions of whether this
[13:07] is right or wrong or whatever it may be
[13:10] check your check your motive check how
[13:12] much time you're spending with god
[13:13] because if god
[13:14] if you're if the things of the word and
[13:17] the lord and your walk is sitting on the
[13:19] side and you're playing video games and
[13:20] you're doing this and you're doing that
[13:22] like i said i'm talking to myself
[13:24] then i would say all those things are
[13:25] wrong because anything you're putting
[13:27] before your spiritual walk
[13:28] is wrong so i just i pray that you all
[13:31] once again you just
[13:33] keep me in your prayers and it's my
[13:35] desire to spend more time with him like
[13:36] i said i'm not
[13:37] i wasn't talking to him i told him that
[13:39] too on the phone i said i'm not just
[13:40] talking to you
[13:41] i'm talking to myself too but anyway i
[13:43] just i just wanted to share that with
[13:44] you all this morning and
[13:46] and i'll move on sorry for talking so
[13:48] much
[13:53] and today the lord just kind of gave me
[13:54] some slower songs he didn't give me
[13:56] any really fast ones other than uh that
[13:59] first one so
[14:00] just enter with worship with me and just
[14:02] you know just give god your very best
[14:04] this evening
[14:10] when everything falls apart
[14:17] praise his name
[14:20] when you have a broken heart
[14:25] just raise your hands and say
[14:33] [Music]
[14:39] and you'll take the pain away
[14:45] [Music]

[43:49] coming sunday
[43:50] we will have a regular offering then at
[43:53] the end of the service
[43:54] probably we're going to pick up a
[43:55] building fund and we will do the same

[43:59] every two weeks bi-weekly
[44:02] amen if those that get paid bi-weekly

[44:16] for this coming sunday lords willing if
[44:18] you miss the wednesday service
[44:20] where we stop on ezekiel 23 you need to
[44:23] catch up
[44:24] and stay on top of it then we can move
[44:26] together if you want to come
[44:28] start meditating we stop in ezekiel 23
[44:32] so you can meditate on ezekiel 23 and
[44:35] meditate on
[44:36] proverbs 7. if you don't understand
[44:38] anything just pray
[44:40] and the holy spirit will be moving and
[44:42] he will unfold what is
[44:44] written there we spoke about the
[44:46] children and we give you a solution
[44:48] for the kids brother branham said the
[44:50] solution is prayer
[44:52] amen now we talk about the adolescent
[44:56] and we have been
[44:57] opening a whole lot of channel with
[44:59] adolescents
[45:00] what is going on in other words we chose
[45:03] you we
[45:04] are showing you every trick of the devil
[45:06] brother branham said to overcome you
[45:08] need to know
[45:09] recognize the devil in any of his tricks
[45:12] amen so we make sure you understand
[45:15] what's going on you understand the
[45:16] process
[45:17] so you can embrace it easily and embrace
[45:20] it with christ
[45:21] and christ will help you cross that path
[45:23] amen
[45:24] once we get finished and clear
[45:26] everything there then we're going to
[45:28] give you a solution
[45:29] if you are struggling with adolescent
[45:32] what does brother branham say
[45:33] about it just like we give you a
[45:35] solution for the kids we're going to
[45:37] give you a solution for our adolescent
[45:39] but the first one is to make sure you
[45:42] receive a mark of christ
[45:44] in your life amen make sure once you're
[45:47] in that age
[45:48] contact jesus christ let him put his
[45:50] seal
[45:51] upon you let him put a mark upon you
[45:54] just like he did it for
[45:56] for jacob once you got his mark upon you
[45:59] then you know exactly that you're not
[46:02] going
[46:03] in this life journey alone but there is
[46:05] a big brother
[46:06] that is standing there who's going with
[46:09] you and he's going to remove the heat
[46:11] from the fire
[46:12] and make sure you cross everything safe
[46:15] and you make it to the other side
[46:17] everybody clear so that will be ezekiel
[46:19] 23
[46:20] and proverb 7. once we finish there then
[46:24] we drop into menopause
[46:26] somebody asked me so when you talk about
[46:28] mediocre what about the man
[46:32] amen usually when god speak to his
[46:35] children
[46:36] he refer the church as a woman
[46:39] that's why the woman in ezekiel came up
[46:42] to
[46:42] appear to be a woman amen not a man
[46:45] sometimes
[46:46] he uses men but for the majority of the
[46:48] time the church
[46:49] has been represented as a woman amen
[46:52] that's why we're going to go through
[46:54] menopause but there is something brother
[46:55] brandon also
[46:56] spoke about the man that goes with the
[46:59] man so when we spoke about
[47:00] a ladies or when we're talking about
[47:02] young sister it is not only young sister
[47:04] also young brothers just like the sister
[47:07] have to keep their virtues
[47:09] i have a scripture a quote where brother
[47:11] branham shows also that the boys
[47:14] need to keep themselves pure everybody
[47:16] clear
[47:17] we usually point to the sister like the
[47:19] boys have a right to go do whatever they
[47:22] want to do
[47:22] and come again and claim sister i want a
[47:25] virgin you better be yourself
[47:28] amen you better be yourself
[47:32] you want one you stay like that amen
[47:35] blessed be the name of the lord so once
[47:37] we finish that
[47:38] then we drop into the elderly just a
[47:40] little bit touch
[47:41] and you will understand why paul say to
[47:44] timothy don't take a younger
[47:46] widow you wait only to the age one
[47:50] you remember that scripture you can go
[47:52] ahead and read it
[47:54] and from there we will see tonight we
[47:56] have brother polycarp
[47:58] it has been a while that he have not
[48:00] spoken so he will be preaching tonight
[48:03] i told him i'm not a man that give up
[48:06] especially when it comes to spiritual
[48:08] thing i will
[48:09] fight the devil until i get what belongs
[48:12] to me
[48:13] amen if it doesn't belong to me i'm not
[48:16] gonna fight it
[48:16] i'm not gonna fight to have a possession
[48:19] to go to hell that's not my property
[48:21] but everything that belongs to me i'm
[48:23] gonna fight it so i told him i said
[48:25] brother caleb we'll again
[48:27] translate you we want him to be trained
[48:30] until he can do it
[48:31] amen so brother caleb you dare like a
[48:34] warrior
[48:35] you come back again until you conquer
[48:38] all the way to the end amen the bible
[48:41] says the spirit of the prophet is
[48:42] subject to the prophet
[48:44] i'm there as an overseer i'm a backup i
[48:47] can do it
[48:48] but i want to train the younger one let
[48:51] them
[48:51] take care of the computer let them take
[48:53] care of the camera
[48:54] let them take care of the music let them
[48:58] go ahead and be involved
[48:59] into things that belongs to the kingdom
[49:01] of god it will keep their mind
[49:03] occupied and they're going to learn how
[49:05] to serve god
[49:06] at a younger age brother branham said if
[49:09] there was one regret that he has
[49:11] i can give you many quotes on that but
[49:14] branham said it's because
[49:15] i didn't serve the lord when i was
[49:17] younger
[49:18] so once you have an opportunity we are
[49:20] opening an opportunity
[49:22] if you're a sister you want to sing sing
[49:25] amen
[49:26] don't wait he didn't say you have to
[49:28] have a beautiful voice to sing
[49:30] the bible say make a joyful noise
[49:33] as long as it's a joyful nose we're
[49:35] gonna be
[49:36] singing together with you amen the more
[49:38] you do it the better you get
[49:40] if you got complex that's your problem
[49:43] because when we go to heaven
[49:44] you're going to have a problem singing
[49:46] amen brother branham said if you want to
[49:49] find him in heaven do you know where to
[49:50] find him
[49:51] he said go see where there is a choir of
[49:54] angel
[49:54] he said if you're here brother branham
[49:56] will be standing right there
[49:58] so even your prophet love music amen
[50:02] so young people get engaged by the
[50:03] polycarp we're going to call you
[50:05] and brother caleb will be translating
[50:09] so go ahead and do the best amen

[1:22:33] the activity of fishing
[1:22:50] by fishing and that's how he was paying
[1:22:52] his bills
[1:22:54] and that's why he spraying everything by

[1:23:19] was doing it
[1:23:21] and all that night and he fished

[1:23:52] was waiting for him in the house
[1:23:54] yes his wife was waiting for him in the
[1:23:55] house but to come to the house

[1:24:17] the word of god says that peter tried
[1:24:19] everything
[1:24:21] he did all these tricks that he could do
[1:24:25] and he was done there was nothing left
[1:24:31] for him to use that what is no all of
[1:24:33] his ideas
[1:24:36] he had to go back home the wife was
[1:24:39] waiting for him at home
[1:24:41] the wife was waiting for him he also had
[1:24:44] to pay the bills
[1:24:47] certainly the wife would have told him
[1:24:50] ask of him so peter

[1:29:05] all this time that you came into the
[1:29:06] lord you work for the lord but he's
[1:29:10] always on the surface
[1:29:13] everything that you accomplish
[1:29:16] is everything at work on the surface
[1:29:21] so what are you gonna speak about your
[1:29:22] future
[1:29:24] you have a church you built you you
[1:29:28] bought the church
[1:29:29] everything is still on the surface
[1:29:32] god have something for you it's a bigger
[1:29:35] thing
[1:29:36] than what you expected
[1:29:44] god knows that we we we bought the
[1:29:47] church amen
[1:29:48] amen but what god is saying tonight
[1:29:52] you're not going to stop contributing
[1:29:54] we're going to continue
[1:29:56] we're going to continue to give you the
[1:29:57] initials and let me tell you something
[1:30:00] just the parenthesis
[1:30:03] in the old testament people were giving
[1:30:05] offerings they were giving tithing unto
[1:30:07] me amen
[1:30:08] amen they were giving their timing
[1:30:13] do you know what happened in the new
[1:30:14] testament
[1:30:17] the believer in the new testament
[1:30:20] [Music]
[1:30:21] in the old testament they were giving 10
[1:30:23] percent
[1:30:25] and 90 belong to you
[1:30:28] but if you go to the book of fact in the
[1:30:30] new testament
[1:30:32] the people were selling their houses
[1:30:36] to bring everything into the house of
[1:30:38] the lord
[1:30:39] so they went beyond ten percent
[1:30:42] tell me how can god not bless somebody
[1:30:45] like that
[1:30:50] tell me how can god not accomplish great
[1:30:53] things like the shadow of peter
[1:30:56] healing people because they went into
[1:30:58] the deal
[1:30:59] it is not complete because they
[1:31:01] understood the power of god
[1:31:03] amen who surveyed and you know
[1:31:06] usually we buy houses
[1:31:11] and do you buy those home for god
[1:31:14] no you buy them for your family to give
[1:31:16] it to your children
[1:31:18] but tell me what are you going to buy
[1:31:20] for christ
[1:31:22] that's just something i want you to
[1:31:23] think over about jesus
[1:31:26] seek first the kingdom of god and
[1:31:28] everything shall be added unto you
[1:31:36] tell your brother or your sister who the
[1:31:38] one who's sitting behind you
[1:31:40] your future is still more to come
[1:31:45] jesus told peter
[1:31:47] [Music]
[1:31:50] all this stampede you were working by
[1:31:52] your own strengths
[1:31:55] you were looking at your own ability
[1:31:58] to get you connected because it's your
[1:32:00] profession
[1:32:02] directly because you were going by rules
[1:32:05] those were rules of fiction
[1:32:09] we know that you were taught by your
[1:32:10] master
[1:32:12] it's just like you go to school and
[1:32:14] somebody teach you for you to be
[1:32:16] successful in life
[1:32:17] you need to do this you need to do this
[1:32:19] the medical doctor said you need to do
[1:32:21] this you need to do that
[1:32:26] and the medical doctor said you must go
[1:32:27] through this surgery
[1:32:30] you must go through this logical
[1:32:32] scientific proof
[1:32:34] this is what the life you were living
[1:32:36] before this
[1:32:37] is not what god is speaking tonight
[1:33:07] [Music]
[1:33:10] do you believe in your healing amen amen
[1:33:14] just believe in your healing and you
[1:33:16] will see
[1:33:17] the glory of god amen amen
[1:33:34] they told you if you seek with cancer if
[1:33:37] you have a female trouble
[1:33:39] or you cannot conceive second on thee
[1:33:42] those that told you the reproduction
[1:33:45] are they the one that created you son
[1:33:48] take you on for me
[1:34:01] they do the best that they can
[1:34:06] healing belongs only to god
[1:34:10] they can do a surgery performing surgery
[1:34:13] but for that surgery to heal
[1:34:18] so that everything comes back to normal
[1:34:21] that's a mystery of god amen amen
[1:34:25] that's the reason why
[1:34:29] so we want to go beyond our senses
[1:34:44] which is a realm of the spirit which is
[1:34:47] the realm of the spirit of god
[1:34:50] if you take a risk for instance
[1:34:57] if you don't take risk in life you're
[1:34:59] not going to succeed anyway
[1:35:01] because if you don't whisk you won't
[1:35:03] have anything
[1:35:05] that's the reason why i told you
[1:35:08] moses has a road but he never used that
[1:35:10] road to measure
[1:35:12] the depth of the red sea
[1:35:17] josh would never worry about how much
[1:35:19] was
[1:35:20] the deep water of jordan
[1:35:24] daniel when he faced lioness
[1:35:40] they never measure the temperature they
[1:35:43] look into the unseen
[1:35:45] unto the spirit of god
[1:35:48] so never rely on your knowledge
[1:35:52] you must take risk with god a
[1:35:57] so whatever god bring as an inspiration
[1:36:00] to you
[1:36:04] because in your future on this earth
[1:36:06] there are many realms you must reach
[1:36:10] now you need more than what you have now
[1:36:15] and you need more than the ability you
[1:36:17] are using now
[1:36:19] you need the supernatural in your life
[1:36:25] [Music]
[1:36:28] you need a supernatural to be
[1:36:30] demonstrated
[1:36:31] to you as an individual
[1:36:36] you need a specific sound for you
[1:36:39] [Music]
[1:36:40] you need a god save the lord for you
[1:36:44] elohim you need elohim
[1:36:51] you need the word that is stepping out
[1:36:54] of eternity
[1:36:55] and step inside of your flesh
[1:37:02] because our most of our blessings are
[1:37:05] still into the deep
[1:37:10] you remember in the bible
[1:37:17] anna had to go deep in her prayer life
[1:37:21] in order to receive samuel the prophet
[1:37:27] when emma started praying meme
[1:37:31] prophet
[1:37:31] [Music]
[1:37:37] when she get deep into her prayer even
[1:37:40] illa the priest could not discern what
[1:37:43] was wrong with the woman
[1:37:45] so gps the gps of ela the priest
[1:37:49] was completely lost
[1:37:52] he looked he said what is wrong with
[1:37:54] that woman maybe she's a drunk
[1:37:58] but she was not drunk with wine
[1:38:08] the problem that she had in her own life
[1:38:12] push her to go deep into prayer
[1:38:17] when anna when anna was expressing
[1:38:20] herself
[1:38:21] with groanings like oh god oh god
[1:38:25] all those are groanings
[1:38:29] those groanings even speak better than
[1:38:31] your words
[1:38:33] just one groaning for example
[1:38:37] maybe end i was saying ouch lord
[1:38:41] just that ouch lord means more to god
[1:38:44] than even the words it means
[1:38:48] that groaning of ouch have a lot of
[1:38:51] things
[1:38:52] bundled into one groaning
[1:38:56] that's why ila could not decode
[1:38:59] that kind of language amen amen
[1:39:03] glory be to god
[1:39:07] there was no future 2 2
[1:39:10] 19
[1:39:25] 19 verse 30 and the remnant that escape
[1:39:29] out of judah
[1:39:32] shall yet again take root downward
[1:39:35] and bear fruit upwards
[1:39:46] take root downward and bear fruit upward
[1:39:52] if they are talking about
[1:39:55] root going downward
[1:40:00] in other words the root must go really
[1:40:03] deep
[1:40:04] amen amen
[1:40:09] [Music]
[1:40:21] a tree that bears fruit is a tree that
[1:40:23] have
[1:40:24] the roots really deep into the ground
[1:40:30] it is that depth into the ground
[1:40:33] that brings the height of the trees
[1:40:38] if you look at this great big building
[1:40:40] this hotel
[1:40:43] if we look at this beautiful hotel amen
[1:40:46] amen
[1:40:48] la we understand
[1:40:51] the depth that the engineering have to
[1:40:54] dig
[1:40:55] first before they elevate the building
[1:40:59] it's because of the death
[1:41:02] that's the reason why it can sustain
[1:41:05] such a high tall building
[1:41:07] amen hallelujah
[1:41:10] so for you to see such a tall building
[1:41:13] you need a really
[1:41:14] deep roaded ground
[1:41:25] so when you look at the talk tree just
[1:41:27] remember the root is the one
[1:41:29] actually determining the height of
[1:41:32] control
[1:41:33] so you want to go really deep with the
[1:41:35] lord second year put towards
[1:41:37] what god has in your life it is in the
[1:41:40] deep
[1:41:41] if it's here let me take your vision a
[1:41:43] little bit
[1:41:58] you can read the home 9 to 10.
[1:42:03] but let me touch the main point
[1:42:09] descended
[1:42:14] is the same also that ascended that
[1:42:17] far above all heavens
[1:42:20] that he might feel all things because
[1:42:23] they complement tonight do you
[1:42:24] understand what i'm talking about now
[1:42:26] you'll fall apart from them so first you
[1:42:28] must descend
[1:42:31] jesus went all the way to
[1:42:35] hell
[1:42:38] and the bible said that's why the lord
[1:42:41] gave him a name that is above
[1:42:43] every other name
[1:42:47] because there is no greater name than
[1:42:49] the name of jesus christ
[1:42:54] even in the heaven there is no one that
[1:42:57] is greater than the lord jesus christ
[1:43:00] because he was the one that first
[1:43:02] descended
[1:43:03] now he ascended far above everything
[1:43:08] so the first the next move of the lord
[1:43:11] in your life
[1:43:13] the portion of benediction so the next
[1:43:15] blessing of the lord in your life
[1:43:19] the things that god have been holding
[1:43:22] for you
[1:43:28] [Music]
[1:43:36] you must take a risk to go into the deep
[1:43:39] with the lord
[1:43:45] ask the one who's been who's sitting
[1:43:47] beside you
[1:43:49] is your relationship with the lord
[1:43:54] tell me how deep are you with the lord
[1:43:57] how deep how much depth am i into the
[1:44:00] lord
[1:44:01] how much are you deep into the lord
[1:44:18] because the blessings that you have the
[1:44:22] blessings that is that
[1:44:24] for our future all of them are still
[1:44:27] into the deeper second
[1:44:28] professor what we did accomplishing this
[1:44:31] church is good
[1:44:35] we have accomplished so many things in
[1:44:38] our own life
[1:44:40] sabine that is good
[1:44:43] but what about your future amen amen
[1:45:01] we must go into the deeper amen amen
[1:45:07] where are the miracles of the lord you
[1:45:10] need miracles
[1:45:12] go into the deep with the
[1:45:15] must have a lord relationship with the
[1:45:17] lord
[1:45:20] new devils we must go into the deep amen
[1:45:24] amen if you don't take a risk with god
[1:45:30] there is no way you can possess those
[1:45:32] things that belong to you
[1:45:36] remember
[1:45:42] when a woman goes to deliver
[1:45:46] hell and so i first said the maintenance
[1:45:48] first of all they sit with a doctor
[1:45:51] and a sony and they are there completely
[1:45:54] hellenistic and they don't they are not
[1:45:58] even ashamed of the doctor
[1:45:59] amen amen not on to the person they
[1:46:02] don't even
[1:46:03] they are not ashamed of the doctor
[1:46:08] because they are under suffering there
[1:46:11] is something that must be delivered
[1:46:14] so she can even cry scream she doesn't
[1:46:17] care who's standing in front of her
[1:46:24] because she needs all the energy to go
[1:46:26] into labor
[1:46:29] because the baby have to come out
[1:46:33] they don't care who's sitting there or
[1:46:34] not
[1:46:36] they're not even paying attention to
[1:46:38] anybody
[1:47:00] [Music]
[1:47:07] and she will look at you like why are
[1:47:08] you staring at me
[1:47:11] but when she was going through labor she
[1:47:13] didn't care about who was in the room
[1:47:15] because she was injured so god wants you
[1:47:19] to be in that situation
[1:47:21] amen amen you must
[1:47:24] be into the deep tonight so let's go
[1:47:28] launch into the deeper letter
[1:47:31] everything that we did
[1:47:34] we always have on being on the surface
[1:47:36] amen amen
[1:47:39] we were we were accomplishing things on
[1:47:41] the surface
[1:47:42] all the time that you were in this

[1:48:39] the problem of the children of god is
[1:48:42] this
[1:48:43] god already promised
[1:48:58] there is no way you can possess that
[1:49:00] even though you see those promises
[1:49:02] staring at you
[1:49:04] you will be just like uh like uh like
[1:49:07] uh like a public speaker
[1:49:11] and you will never reach out to what

[1:49:49] to see you
[1:49:50] yes lord i want to walk yes lord i want

[1:53:57] or whatever the voodoo doctor which is
[1:54:00] spoke about your life
[1:54:05] we are standing upon the blood of jesus
[1:54:07] christ
[1:54:09] which is a higher power
[1:54:12] and we are declaring that we will
[1:54:14] blossom in our life
[1:54:17] i am telling you your life will blossom
[1:54:35] just like the earth was programmed to
[1:54:37] bring for fruits
[1:54:40] you gave to speak to your womb to bring
[1:54:42] your fruits
[1:54:45] and your breasts will be announcing your
[1:54:47] children
[1:55:01] [Music]
[1:55:02] amen
[1:55:16] you must change your ways of praying
[1:55:18] amen amen
[1:55:25] if you notice when jesus was casting our
[1:55:27] devils
[1:55:30] jesus was not playing games with david
[1:55:33] he was telling the devil leave
[1:55:36] that one shut up
[1:55:39] first see do this lost
[1:55:44] but when you pray shuck it what
[1:55:47] teacher selling them
[1:55:48] every time you are casting out devils
[1:55:52] the devil even don't care about your way
[1:55:55] of praying
[1:55:57] the devil don't even care about your
[1:55:59] voice amen
[1:56:00] amen they are looking at you
[1:56:04] barking baskets because you don't
[1:56:08] recognize yourself
[1:56:11] remember joshua
[1:56:29] [Music]
[1:56:39] just think about those big walls
[1:56:53] the wall of the city of jericho
[1:56:56] maybe people could even build upon those
[1:56:58] worlds
[1:56:59] but those walls came down just boy with
[1:57:03] the future
[1:57:04] just with the footsteps let me tell you
[1:57:08] again something
[1:57:10] in the book of joshua
[1:57:13] city i believe chapter 7
[1:57:16] if i'm not mistaken verse 3 to 6.
[1:57:21] those are not people just like this
[1:57:24] those that are leprosy
[1:57:26] [Music]
[1:57:28] there were four lepers they were
[1:57:31] handicapped in their lives
[1:57:33] [Music]
[1:57:35] let me ask you do you have a disability
[1:57:38] on your life yes on the campaign you are
[1:57:40] not disabled
[1:57:41] in the campaign you are not even
[1:57:43] disabled
[1:57:45] how come disabled people did certain
[1:57:47] things
[1:57:48] and you cannot do anything
[1:57:53] i believe it's second king seven instead
[1:57:58] second king chapter seven
[1:58:01] verse three to six
[1:58:19] about the jesus there were miracles
[1:58:22] during the sermon
[1:58:24] and we also wanted three years the same
[1:58:26] thing
[1:58:27] because it's the same god and he must
[1:58:31] manifest himself tonight
[1:58:32] no
[1:59:01] [Music]
[1:59:03] but there is a place where there is
[1:59:04] plenty of food
[1:59:06] but it was if you notice in the camp of
[1:59:09] the enemy
[1:59:10] in the camp of the syrians
[1:59:43] and they start walking and they start
[1:59:45] walking
[1:59:46] they start working now listen to what
[1:59:50] happened
[1:59:52] for the lord has made a host of syrians
[1:59:55] to hear
[2:00:00] [Music]
[2:00:08] even the noise of a great host elizabeth
[2:00:22] to come upon us
[2:00:26] just they were thinking about a whole
[2:00:29] country coming against them
[2:00:32] all they heard there was the lord of
[2:00:35] chariots
[2:00:37] horses and chairs
[2:00:53] just go ahead and repeat the problem but
[2:00:55] make a joyful noise
[2:00:57] make a joyful noise because god will
[2:01:00] take care of your enemy
[2:01:02] god will take care of that knowledge
[2:01:05] you cry the life you suffer
[2:01:21] tonight it's a world of christ he will
[2:01:24] say cry
[2:01:26] and we're going to change our way of
[2:01:27] praying we are getting into the deeper
[2:01:30] hallelujah hallelujah
[2:01:33] i want you to start praying yourself
[2:01:48] amen
[2:01:58] if you can play something soft that's
[2:02:00] fine but if you also want to pray you
[2:02:03] can join with us in prayer
[2:02:06] let's just take at least two minutes
[2:02:08] let's pray before we go home
[2:02:10] amen amen
[2:02:14] because the devil must hear the noise
[2:02:16] amen amen
[2:02:30] but if you look at leprosy all over the
[2:02:33] body
[2:02:34] listen to me but the enemy must hear the
[2:02:37] noise
[2:02:37] amen amen god took care of the lord
[2:02:42] so that the enemy came they must
[2:02:57] let's go in prayer
