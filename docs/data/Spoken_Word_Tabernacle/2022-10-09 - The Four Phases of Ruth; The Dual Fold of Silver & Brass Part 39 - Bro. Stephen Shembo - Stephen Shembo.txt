only thing you can forget is our sins and father that we stand perfect before you there's no sin in US and Lord talking with the brother yesterday telling him that we how there's no iniquity he was talking about David and the things that he did and and but David looked down and he could see that there was coming of people that you would not charge iniquity to and father here we are in that day a

Amen brother Charles remember it's a wedding they never got married in the church so we know that we want to do it correctly if you have a call you need the code you see me so when somebody feel late that they want to put something in order but a random say they better do it rather than struggle with the devil down the road amen so remember people continue to pray and continue to pray for the church and for everybody amen let's go to our scripture uh God always give you a good appetizer those fresh loaves that you get before your meals come they always good oh God glory to God Daniel 2 32. and Daniel 7 again it's hard when I say I'm going to be finishing this I get here and then 25 miles an hour so it's a big problem I'm trying the best to dodge the 70 weeks I see them left and right I try to go this way they're blocking me I tried to go this way so I have to keep escaping them so when you hear me mentioning sometimes if you have time you can listen to it that will help you out amen

legalistic when you see me good morning Pastor then you are Christian losing up let's talk how are you doing big how are you doing big brother you doing okay what's going on how is school going are you getting these or C's or hey then we can talk Daniel chapter 2. I'm just relaxing you okay Daniel chapter 2 verse 32. this image head was a fine gold foreign don't be minding about standing for the scripture because I have a quote for you I have a scripture to prove you that when we read the word you should be sending and I have a quote also brother Branham gave you the quote but not the scripture but I have the scripture to back brother okay so it's a little exercise a profited I have also a scripture for that United Way to relax image head was a fine gold its breast and its arm of silver it's barely and its tie of Bryce you might be seated when we emphasize last week was that the breast and the arm we have two breasts two arms which is the middle pigeon okay Kingdom it's two Kingdom that I joined together everybody okay go to Daniel chapter seven you will need your Bible today you really need your Bible there is absolutely no way I can go around without using the scripture last Sunday I have to go through the scriptures so you can see where brother Branham is coming with his description about the Barbarian being cruel ravishing women brother Branham didn't just came out and hated the Russian people and saying things like that no brother Brian I'm actually was pulling stuff from the scripture amen so now when you look at the scripture you look at the bra at the message it's always I even seen things that I brought around I'm never gave even any reference before you know it today right there I will show you down the road that even things that happen personally in brother Branham life will line up in the scripture even his own stuff if I give you the story you'll think brother Branham is just telling you a story maybe he's in a wood doing something and I can pull it to you I say look at the description in the scripture and you will be amazed and what about them never even say anything about the scripture in other words we receive a powerful message Daniel chapter seven if you dare you can say Amen verse 4 again the first was like a lion you know that and he had the ego wings I beheld till the wings thereof were plugged and he was lift up from the earth and made stand upon defeat as a man you understand this language now and immense heart towards given to it and behold another Beast a second like a bear we know the bear is the silver that was right here this is made out of silver that was in the natural in a spiritual this silver is a bear amen we have two arms two breasts so the bear must have also two sides amen the Bible said the second like a bear and he raised up where is my friend with the microphone praise God on the MoneyGram amen we say and he raised up itself on one side so there is one side that the bear is using so there is another side in other words they gotta be too sad so the bear have two sides but he's using more one side amen and that one side when he's coming up with it okay now it works when that one side is coming out the Bible says he had three ribs in the mouth so this bear didn't just come and grab three ribs as it's coming up it is wire it is hooked it is connected it is combined it is joined with three ribs you cannot separate the bear from the river everybody okay in other words every word that bear is going his mind is on the is holding the rib amen that one sad deal with three ribs so some somewhere the Flesh of the rib was already eaten so somebody was already killed when you hold when an animal is having a a bone in the mouth it tells you the remaining is already gone that's just the proof but the proof was not ahead no it was not an arm it was the river but not one rib but three ribs everybody okay glory to God Amen and then detained and and they say that's to it arise devour much flesh so it's a destructive Mr Man after this I behelding law another like a leopard which head upon the back of it for wings of the fowl so the bear works with two side and two breasts two arms but when it comes to the Brass which was the kingdom that followed the brass over here Works came up as a leopard amen and this leopard have not two he have four four wings so as we progress you will see that move that that Kingdom moving with four wings in other words there was four things that were combined together into one everybody okay the Bible says that he have four wings of a file so we don't know which file it is the Beast had also four heads so not only four wings but he has four heads in other words it's like four leopard everybody okay Dada combined together into one power everybody okay the body is one but the head is four all right so when this Beast is attacking he's gonna attack by four different assault everybody okay praise God and Dominion was given to it let's stop there and I'm gonna grab the last Beast later on let's go to Revelation chapter 13. you should be happy because now you are jumping up and down on the Book of Daniel you are dancing with Daniel and smiling and everything Daniel becomes your friend you used to run away say Daniel good morning Daniel I'm going to John I'm going to Matthew I'm going to look some of us love the song that's their best friend forever when they read the Bible of someone Psalm 2 something some 119 they skip it because it's long Pastor where do you get this stuff how many reps some 119. they always skip it let's read this one family not someone hungry because everybody will be slumbering [Laughter] it's got to Revelation 13. now we are happy we can read the book of Daniel a very mysterious book verse one if you dare you can say amen and I stood upon the sand of the sea and I saw a beast rise up you know this Beast having you out of the sea having seven heads and ten horns and upon his horns ten crowns Lord they help me and upon his heads the name of blasphemy you understand this now there was one name Seven Hills you remember and the beasts which I saw was like unto the leopard it's right there and his feet were as the feet of a bear rather and his mouth as the mouth of a lion all those three beasts combined together and the dragon gave him his power you understand what he means now and his seat which happened in pergamas and great Authority and I saw one of his head as he were wounded to death we know this is a Roman Empire and his deadly wound was healed and all the world wander after the Beast so this is a Roman Beast here it is Rome which is a mixture of tree amen glory to God verse 4 and they worship the Dragon which give power to the Beast so through this Beast you are worshiping the devil and they worship the Beast saying who is like to the Beast who is able to make war with him so it's Abyss that can make war he did it naturally and he knows how to do it spiritually under a nicolaitan spirit because he went to conquer yes everybody okay now verse 5 and there was given to him a mouth speaking water I want you to remember that the mouth of this Beast amen amen your boss is dropping stuff uh go back to verse two and the Beast which I saw was like unto the leopard and his feet were unto the feet of a bear and his mouth has the mouth of water a lion lion was which kingdom so the mouth has Babylon that's coming from your boss amen everybody okay so the speech is a dragon the mouth is Babylon everybody okay but this month is speaking what remember that why do you want me to remember such a detail great things why do you want me to remember because brother Branham said scripture does not play with him whatever is in the record it's there for the anointed as to what it's there forever purpose nothing is written in the Bible to play around with and nothing was preaching this message for nothing even what you think is not necessary God doesn't waste his anointing for brother Branham to come and preach the 70 weeks of Daniel and we don't need it so that therefore is stuck that usually say do we need this to go to heaven do we need to know the sales to be saved do we need to know the seven weeks of Daniel do you do to go to heaven it's a devilish stop because God won't waste his anointing to teach you the future home and the amazing part it comes from preachers it is the preacher that are causing the people to discuss this message the preacher are telling the people what is necessary and what is not necessary in the message the entire message is necessary the vision of brother Branham is necessary the life of brother Branham is necessary what do you do with the life of Abraham [Music] we don't need this it's just knowledge really so God wasted his time to preach a message that you don't need coming from hell put me on Facebook [Music] I'm already got used to war amen where am I glory to God verse 5 and there was given to him a mom speaking great things and water blasphemies and power was given to him to continue 40 and two months I'm living that alone I'm living that alone because he had to handle with Armageddon and he opened his mouth in blasphemy against the whole God and blood to blaspheme his name and his Tabernacle and them that dwell in heaven what an insulting mouth blaspheming not only God but the temple of God and not only the temple of God he's also blaspheming you you know that you dwell in heaven your angel even behold the face of God glory to God Amen job to verse 18 who is this Beast here that's speaking too much great things verse 18. here is water wisdom remember the wise virgin the wise will understand here okay because what made them wise was the oil amen and that oil is the oil of wisdom which is Christ because Christ is the wisdom of God in other words here is Christ [Music] hey everybody okay here is wisdom let him that has understanding come the number of the water Beast for it is the number of water so this Beast here is a man am I reading a different Bible no the Beast is a man and he's a man that speak in his mouth he's a false prophet foreign to help you up easily he's a pope I already told you that amen for it is the number of a man and his number is 600 three score and Waters we found it under vicarious Philly day you remember how many seats do you have three a trinity of six and six is the number of water I was looking for this a long time I can find it until now we got six we got six we got six amen and water and water how many ribs do we have I searched for this I pray for God I say what is hidden here he just gave it to me now amen how many ribs do we have three and we represent what amen you don't know he represented only few people he represent what a woman what did they do to Adam here they pulled water how many women do we have we [Music] eternity and a trinity in water women so the bear is wired to destroy it is built in him to do that let's pray Heavenly Father Lord we are approaching you again humbly this morning Father thanking you for your grace for your love your mercy and for everything you have been doing for us father we are committing this service unto the hand Lord may you move every demonic spirit of destruction and slumbering that is making people to sleep during the service may you move it completely out of this place May the Holy Spirit Come and Minister and Enlighten your children father so that they can see the hour that they're living in Lord we thank you for giving us this time this morning touch those that have been affected by the weather coughing or having Lord father uh nasal problem or secretion or respiratory problem may you touch and heal them in the name of Jesus Christ be the Alpha and the Omega Lord as we humbly asked in Jesus precious name amen go with me in Daniel chapter 8. glory to God I always give you some clue eat go to sleep on time wake up eat good relax and you come to church fine so you were playing on the internet good luck everybody okay all right my subject this morning is the four phases of roof they do a fold of the silver and the water we talk about this subject I could not get into it the silver is the middle pigeon and the brass is the Greece Empire you already know about it amen we're still dealing with the second oil we are in the trashing fall and in the Tabernacle we are way deep my friend down into the Holy Ghost amen I'm gonna remind you this again for a purpose brother Branham say any Bible readers here knows that all scriptures so in other words you got double bubble you got a double bubble amen all scripture has a compound meaning okay every prophecy some most all of it has a doer a time there or two times or more that it shall be answered as a revolving water history in other words something will repeat itself and we know it happened the first time for a reference everybody okay why is it important to understand the revolving of the stories of the scripture because brother Branham says that Spirit does not die amen so if a spirit was used the first time it is more likely than that spirit will be used the second time again but Spirit doesn't die God take his man but never his spirit God took Elijah and the double portion of his Spirit come upon Elisha about 800 years later come out on John the Baptist and predicted to come again in the last day God took Christ out of the Earth but the Holy Spirit come back again the devil take his manner but the spirit remained just the water saying where are you going with this when we look at Daniel chapter 2 we found out that we have four kingdoms and they are described with minerals we got the gold we got the silver the brass the iron and Dan it's the brass it's the iron mixed with Clay on Daniel 7 those kingdom are explained or described with by their anointing or their power and remember every one of this power is a wild beast it's a Savage it's an untamed Beast everybody okay and we emphasize on the middle Persian Kingdom because that is what was represented by a bear and we found today that when we dealt with a bear the bear was coming out actually from the water combined connected join couple married with three ribs which are just explained to you everybody okay so far so the bear when he came God used the spirit to destroy Babylon everybody okay so the bear came with a trinity of ribs everybody here we found a trinity of ribs that was already given here and the reap represented a woman and at the end time we found also not two men one man but represented in a trinity of a man because remember the devil work everything by Trinity so this is not really true woman in three women it is one woman represented in a trinity so Trinity didn't start today everybody care Trinity started in Babylon ever here so when God uses the bear God already wired the bear or programmed the bear to destroy the trinity and The Trinity that was combined with a woman with a church it started in ancient Babylon brother Branham says this my friend glory to God he said monetize turn to water polytheism in water Babylon in plain word the religion of one God the religion of one person in the godhead turn into many person many gods but I'm saying the devil's lie and the devil's mystery rose up against the truth of God and the mysteries of God in that city which city Babylon Satan truly became the God of this world and exactly worship from those that had that he had duped causing them to believe that he was truly the Lord the polytheistic religion of the enemy began with the water with the trinitarian doctrine so Trinity started in Babylon that's why as the bear is coming up he have a reference [Music] he have a clue he has a detection that his couple with and whenever he found Trinity he's gonna destroy it everybody okay brother Branham said that he was way back there in Antiquity that the one God in three person a deer came into Adam Jesus so trivities of the devil here Isaiah the Lord your God is me and my father We Are One everybody okay when you see me you see the water father so the Trinity is of the devil and The Trinity started in Babylon and God when he is rising this power is automatically clap of this power to use Trinity as a detective amen amen amen everybody okay glory to God we found out according to the prophecy of Jeremiah that Jeremiah prophesied about the destruction of Babylon and we've seen last Sunday that that Babylon was not the old Babylon even though God Revenge Babylon but that Babylon was speaking about Babylon in the end time I don't know how I skipped the scripture but I must read it brother Branham says that the Bible says that make bright the arrows gather the shield Jeremiah 51 remember last Sunday the Lord has raised up the spirit of the king of the middies in other words the spirit of the bear was used one time and Destroy Babylon anybody okay and that Spirit did its job very well know everybody okay that God have to reuse that Spirit again Prada pranam says this amen let me go here brother Branham says this Satan don't worry he said look a job a perfect man a just man and God permitted the evil devil to come upon him to chastise him and everything else for the perfecting of his spirit because job was always afraid you know that right if you don't know you see me after church he was always scared that something bad will happen to him God look he said let me make something bad happen to him then he's gonna get used to it everybody okay everybody okay then when the Devil comes back again job will look at the Devil and say so what you already did it uh God delivered me what else can you do that my God cannot deliver me so what what else do you have new everybody okay brother Branham said God uses evil spirit many times [Laughter] God uses evil spirit many times to work out his plan and his will let me help you up if you're struggling go to first king [Music] keep Daniel it because some of the stuff brother Brian I'm saying will be like what God using evil spirit really let's go to first king chapter 22. when I get here I feel like I can stay here eight hours you work eight hours on your job that's your shift be my guest leave me alone I'm on my shift too [Music] some of you even look for overtime [Applause] but I'm gonna stay in overtime can you give me some other time [Laughter] foreign [Laughter] and the boss is the one giving you strength to do that over time amen SEC first king chapter 22 if you dare you can say amen amen go to verse 19. God uses evil spirit I hope I can get it here amen you there okay somebody got it and he said this is Makaya hear you therefore the word of the Lord I saw the Lord sitting on his throne and all the hosts of Heaven standing by him on his right hand and on his left and the Lord say who shall I persuade God wanted to destroy Ahab he's looking for somebody to help him amen who shall I persuade who shall persuade Ahab that he may go up and Fall Away there was a battle coming up God wanted somebody that can persuade Ahab to move on to the battle so he can get killed why because a larger spoke everybody okay and one say this mother on this mother and another say on that matter in other words a discussion open up a house meeting opened up in heaven God began to pass the microphone the first everybody okay am I saying a different language so the first one said you know Daddy we can do this this this we can do this this this we can do this then say okay give to the next one the next one say I have a great idea daddy let's do this this thing and suddenly somebody came verse 21 and there came forth as spirit it amen and stood before the Lord and say I will persuade him where is this Spirit coming from from heaven let's see verse 22 and the Lord said to him wherewith he said I will go forth and I will be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophet and he said You shall persuade him and Prevail also in other words you can do the job pretty good go forth and do so who gave him the permission God with a blessing and we leave it alone now therefore behold the Lord has put the lying spirit in the mouth of all these your prophet and the Lord has spoken evil concerning you so God used an evil spirit to destroy Ahab man everybody okay that's why brother Branham says that God uses evil spirit many times I gave you that example to quieten your nerve amen many times to work out his plan and his will so God used the bear the first time and the bear did a very good job so God came back again to reuse the bear over because when the spirit does a very good job God will reuse that Spirit over again and not only does God use bad Spirit God also use good spirit Amen brother Branham said that these men are kept Alive by God from their original Ministry for future services deserve it how you okay the servant house so well so well just feed the spirit of Elijah Minister how many times and Moses how many times what keep alive for father father Services a simple sort of a person Elijah was and he served God purpose so good that simple Spirit was in Elijah until God used it in three other men already and promised to use it again in the last day so simple just stand there and do whatever tell the truth there anointing of Elijah always tell the truth to the congregation it is an anointing that that's a sugar cut the people the congregation it is an anointing that doesn't compromise it is an anointing that sometimes it might be Miss understood of being rude because it's an anointing that always fit the truth because the truth will set you free you will know the truth and the truth will set you free so in this message if a pastor cannot tell you the truth something is wrong in that church [Applause] everybody okay God will use his spirit when they do a very good job Elijah did a very good job and God have to reuse his Spirit five times Moses did a good job but he messed up the first time that's right that's right and God say he cannot enter the Promised Land but when Moses is coming back God put Elijah beside him so Moses one fell again because Elijah never failed everybody here Moses one fell again because Elijah is ready Elijah had happened five times because five is the number of Grace foreign did I lose the GPS glory to God Amen oh my God this devil what do you want check for me a new battery my friend if we can get it praise God yeah if we can get a new battery it's working I don't know what's going on Amen oh my God for future services yeah I need a new battery if you can amen now but without the Bible said the Lord has raised up the spirit of the king of the middle he's reusing the spirit again for his device is against Babylon to destroy it why do you want to destroy Babylon we found out that Babylon have a woman and the woman is drunk you remember the woman is drunk with the blood of the scent everybody okay and God promised that he will avenge the blood of his sentence glory to God let me see how he works perfect and you're in trouble now devil God used you to remind you to remind me that I need to change the battery so everything working together for good everybody okay he said his device is against Babylon to destroy it why because it is the Avengers of the lord we found out that Babylon have to be destroyed that woman because she was drunk with the blood of your brothers and sisters but here God say in Jeremiah that because it's the Vengeance of the Lord the Avengers of water the temple what is the temple of God you begin to go quickly now I love this church amen let me start the Bible says that the temple of God was open well in heaven so the temple of God was in heaven first am I reading a different Bible everybody okay because Moses God told Moses to build the Tabernacle according to what according to the mother according to what he saw In Heaven There was a temple a Tabernacle in heaven and Moses just duplicated on Earth the Bible says that the temple of God was opened in heaven and there was seen in his step of the water the Ark of water his testimony and they were lightning and voices and thundering and the earthquake and great hell God say I will destroy Babylon because of my temple and the first temple is in heaven what happened in heaven can I continue brother Branham say if God speaks I'll send you he's backer he backs up what you say see notice if you are an ambassador from Heaven All Heaven is water and Heaven is consisted of water the entire Heaven is made out of the word everybody okay that's why when the temple opened up the ark the word the word the Ark of the Covenant not a physical act the word was open everybody okay now what happened in this Heaven that is made out of the word that God want to Revenge amen brother Brian I'm saying this great first battle that was ever thought began begin in heaven where the temple is when Michael and his Angel fought against Lucifer and his Angel he first started the first battle was in where Heaven so sin did not originate on Earth it's originated in water so in heaven in the temple of God Lucifer defiled the first temple of God by bringing sin into heaven I will avenge myself against Babylon because of my temple the Bible said how are they have fallen from heaven or Lucifer he's fallen from heaven from the temple of God Amen son of the morning how are that cut down to the ground which did weaken the nation for thou has said in the heart I will Ascend into water heaven and I will exert my throne above the water stars of God I will seat us upon the Mount of the water so there was a congregation in heaven foreign [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Laughter] you need more scripture and you see me my friend but the Bible says that he also sit while we will also sit upon the Mount of the congregation in the side of the water yours what is north in heaven come on out down my front [Laughter] do you know that the north was where the ego was beautiful for situation the joy of water the whole earth is water Mountain Jerusalem on the side of the water the city of the water great king why was Lucifer looking for the North [Music] everybody okay so in heaven the first temple the devil defiled by bringing sin and dividing the congregation of God he took a third of the angel everybody okay now later on we found out that when Saul went down when Moses came Moses built the Tabernacle and Solomon came and Solomon built the temple of God so the second temple was the Temple of Solomon everybody okay and this Temple was destroyed by Babylon I will avenge myself because of my temple the Bible say in Jeremiah 52 he said now in the fifth month in the tenth day of the month which was the 19th year of Nebuchadnezzar King of water Babylon cannab was a random captain of the god which served the king of Babylon into water Jerusalem and burned the house of the Lord and the King's house and all the houses of Jerusalem on all the houses of the Great Men burn here with what second Chronicle and all the vessels of the house of God great and small and The Treasure of the house of the Lord and the Treasures of the king and of his Praises all these he brought to water Babylon so the second temple of God that God anointed and dwelled into that Temple Babylon came and destroyed that Temple I'm gonna bring veggies because of my temple then later on We Found Jesus coming are we okay are we okay I'm still moving up Jesus said an answer to them destroy water this Temple the Temple of Solomon was destroyed but he was rebuilt again by the rubber bear and the book of Nehemiah everybody okay everybody okay so this Temple was destroyed and rebuilt back again and when he was rebuilt Jesus came and was standing by the temple and Jesus began to speak you need to understand God Jesus want to speak about himself but he sat beside the temple so when he's speaking some will believe he's talking about the temple purposely blinding you everybody okay the Bible says that destroyed this Temple and in water I would do what raise it up then save the Jews 40 and six years the 70 weeks of Daniel Radley let me leave it alone what's this Temple so there is two Temple there Jesus said you destroyed this temple in three days they turned around they say this Temple here it was built it was rebuilt in 46 years you're gonna rebuild it in three days everybody okay don't Disturbed in discipline in building and will that will read up in three days but he speak of the Temple of water his body the Third Temple was the body of Jesus Christ amen and who destroyed Jesus on the culture which is Babylon everybody okay I will avenge myself because of my temple can I continue amen amen but remember the Temple of Solomon was rebuilt again because they thought Jesus was talking about that Temple so there is a fourth temple here which was the Temple of Solomon rebuilt everybody okay in Matthew 24 the Bible said Jesus went out and departed from water the temple that was rebuilt and his disciple came to him for to show him the buildings of the Temple and Jesus said unto them see not all these things all this big building verily I say unto you they shall not be left water here here water one stone a little bit higher my brother one stone what can you give him a little bit before him I want to hear him amen there shall not be left here one storm upon another that shall not be water so Jesus prophesy about the destruction of this Temple again and who destroyed that Temple again can I continue I will avenge myself because of my temple everybody okay Rome destroyed the temple because David says this he said oh God the hidden I'll come into that inheritance the Holy Temple have the water he defiled his temple in heaven he despised the Temple of Solomon he came and destroyed the body of Jesus Christ now there is another Temple again hey everybody okay he said the Holy Temple have dead defiled they have led Jerusalem on Hebrew the dead bodies of that servant have they given to be meat unto the fowl of the heaven the Flesh of descent unto the Beast of the earth their blood have they shed like water water like water round about Jerusalem and there was none to bury them was David at that time [Music] everybody okay was David in this town David C Babylon David was the second king in Israel and David said by the river of Babylon there we sat down did David see when Babylon was destroyed he was so many so many years so many kings down the road but David spoke like he was there because the Bible said that David was a prophet that's why brother Branham says that you know that some are not only sung but they are water prophecy and the Bible say when you are home begin to pray to the Lord using some prophetic songs everybody okay did you know that did you have to read the second Psalm where the very word of Jesus spoke his last word that the cross was recorded in the second in the 22nd Psalm my God my God why has that forsaken me how did they condemn themselves by blaspheming the Holy Ghost calling the spirit of God an unclean Spirit made fun of him when they were dancing in the spirit and so forth on the day of water Pentecost so on the day of Pentecostal when the Holy Ghost came and the people came and look at them they said they are like drunk people God sent Rome again and Rome came and destroyed the table the the temple by Titus brother pranam said that same city they made fun of it that is killed them and there and their blood did what run out run out of the water because David spoke like he's gonna be like a river everybody okay everybody okay so far we good so now in First Corinthians chapter 3 the Bible said now you know that year the water temple of God so the fifth Temple is the bread can I continue and that the spirit of God dwareth in you if any man defiled the temple of God by smoking by fornication by adultery by drug by alcohol he shall God do what destroy because God is going to avenge himself on his Temple everybody okay everybody okay for the temple of God is Holy which temper what know ye not that your water body is the Temple of water the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost which is in you which he have of God and ye are not of your own so your body is a temple of God and when Rome was destroying the Christian he was destroying the temple of God and what agreement has the temple of God with other for ye are the water the Temple of the Living God as God has said our dwell in them and walk in them and I will be their God and they shall be water my people praise God in the book of second Thessalonians this Temple that was destroyed the second time by Rome by tadas will be rebuilt again around it won't be rebuilt together the Temple of Solomon will be rebuilt again and that's going to happen when in the tribulation where you have Moses and Elijah amen first temple defile second destroy God destroy fourth destroy fifth the bread fairly Nasir amen because of Rome everybody okay the fifth one is the Temple of Solomon rebuilt again what is the devil doing to that Temple let no man deceive you by any means for that day shall not come except they cometh Falling Away first that man of sin be revealed the son of water who are positive and exalted himself above all remember Lucifer that is called God or that is worship so that he has what city in water the temple of God the Antichrist will sit in the temple of God showing himself that he is what so wrong the pope was sitting this Temple [Music] can I continue how many temples do we have so far seven Temple the Bible says in the seventh heavens of Daniel the last purpose was to anoint the most holy you can read it at home what is the most holy brother Branham says what is the most holy to my way of seeing it which I believe I can prove it by the scripture is to anoint the water which will be the water that will be used during water because in armaged on everything will be destroyed but when we come back to live for a thousand here here we must have a temple we must have a church we will rebuild again another church can I continue watch the description of the temple that is to be built in the Millennium anyone now anyone any reader that knows that Ezekiel 40 until Ezekiel 44 is nothing in the world but the Millennium water temple being erected on water let's go to Revelation chapter 21. if you move with me quickly we go quickly everybody okay glory to God if you're there you can say a man Revelation 20 actually let's go Revelation 20 verse 7. Lord help me we go downtown I'm trying to keep 45 miles amen if you dare you can say Amen verse seven and one day pass in here are inspired everybody remember this Satan be loose out of his prison and shall go out to deceive the nation which are in the four corners of the Earth we'll get to this later on to gather them together to the battle the number of whom is as the sand of the sea and they went up on the breath of the earth and compassed water the cap of water we will be standing there amen and they beloved water so there will be another Jerusalem in the building everybody okay and another beloved City and Fire come down from God out of heaven and do what them so there will be a millennial Tabernacle a millennial Temple amen and the devil will attack again everybody okay how many Tabernacle do we have seven the seventh one is where God deals with the Devil Himself because the seven is completion this is where Lucifer is destroying everybody okay but does God stop running do we have another Temple are you okay did I lose you let's go to Revelation chapter 22. glory to God 21 actually if you dare you can say Amen after God and my God we destroy the Devil the great Judgment of the word throne come every Wicked person is destroying now we are living on our own now the New Jerusalem come down from heaven like a golden City and sitting there for God and his blood do we have a temple there but that Temple the devil will never mess around and it's which number which is connected to water do we have a temple for our eternity yes yes you ready let's go now in versa job to verse 22. if you're there you can say Amen you there and I saw water I need volume and I saw what no chance I saw no Temple there in for the water lord God and the lamb is water in the city where the lamb is the light in the city where they cometh no night have nothing to do with the Devil so God say I'm gonna raise the spirit of the middies in order to destroy Babylon because of my temple every time I have a temple baby don't come and messes up every time I have a temper Babylon comes and messes up but there is another Temple that is coming up that have nothing to do with the devil it is an eternal Temple and that Temple will never fail [Applause] [Music] everybody okay so far glory to God so we can see here God saying that set up the standard upon the walls of Babylon make the world strong set up the Watchmen prepare the ambushes for the Lord has both divised and done that which we spoke against the inhabitant of water Babylon oh Babylon this is in the Old Testament that dwells upon what does he ring your bell does he win your belt is this Babylon of the Old Testament was the Babylon on in the Old Testament sitting upon water no which Babylon Sid upon the Water it is a woman her name is Mystery water that's it upon water so this prophecy belongs to the end time because the prophecy can happen one time two times three times one more time hey everybody okay everybody okay and we found out that this woman that dwell upon many orders abundant in Treasure you can see that that end is come and the measure of that covenness is water Babylon in the end time is Mystery Babylon everybody okay so far and if it's mystery Babylon we found out that who's gonna burn the prostitute is the Ten Kings and the Ten Kings represented water dictator which represented the spirit of water the spirit of communism which the spirit is connected to Russia everybody okay all right brother Branham say in Russia the birthplace of what communism are we okay are we okay brought upon himself when nurses fascist and communism I don't want to handle this now what's Rising are speaking the name of the Lord they shall all wind up in water so three spirits will combine together into communism everybody okay but did you ever think God has left us an Avenue out if we just take it there is only water Russia that is what communism if we have 100 in Russia follow me carefully Amen brother Branham say only one percent is water communists how many remain 99 so right sir have a dwarfold we okay you cannot take off your seat belt because the altitude is good can I continue now the first is Russia have a one percent and a 99 percent [Music] can I continue are we okay the one percent is communism everybody okay this is the part that is Barbarian [Music] because you would say brother Stephen what about our brothers and sisters I believe this message in Russia if Russia is the bay [Music] everybody okay brother Brandon said there is only one percent of Russia that is communism one person but they are the controlling water if one percent control nandinana which power do they use which power can you control nothing how can you be one person controlling 99 people you must help you what can you say it louder everybody okay because one percent cannot control 99 the only way you can control you must be a tyrant everybody okay everybody okay brother brother I'm saying one percent of Communism of Russia is what communism rather but the daughter help me out brother Brandon he said just quit just forget about communism it is nothing in the world but a bunch of people that is nothing but water it is a water system is not telling you that your brother who believes the message about Barbarian you need to study this message it is a system before somebody come and say he talked about about the Russian people hey everybody okay by the problem say let me show you something just to show how simple it is why there is only one percent of our right side that is what communism they need a messenger one percent cannot continue damn 99 of them are still on the water uh foreign control 99 that ought to explain it to you right there if God didn't permit it well then be thrown out long ago brother Branham say there is no way one percent can control 99 it is God that allowed that to happen because if not this power could have been already overtone Putin can leave the power and put somebody there and come back again and he's again the president what power does he have it is all under the control of God [Music] do you follow me do you follow me so this is [Music] everybody okay I have to go that way did I lose you I lost you raise your hand everybody okay so this action Russia I will bear today have to sign them he has a Christian side and a barbarian side and God called this the spirit of the middle pigeon which is the spirit of the bear but how can a bear have a good side glory to God everybody care let's go to Daniel chapter 8. now we're in a major surgery this is when blood is flowing and we're putting some a goals over there we can't be my it's getting yummy we're cutting out the sickness amen we asking the patient are you okay um I'm good they don't know the truth is about to come out you okay you okay let's go to Daniel chapter eight if you dare say amen amen verse 1. glory to God Lord help me I'm good on time whoever is worrying I told you to read this at home I gave you the lord gave you two or three weeks so if you didn't read it your own fault amen verse 1 in the third years of King bachaza a vision appeared to me you there even to me Daniel after that which appeared to me at first follow me carefully because this is prophecy it's really a surgery here stay alert okay the pastor says stay alert okay if you want to moving moving moving stop moving I don't want you to get lost here verse two and I saw in a vision this is not physical and he came to pass when I saw that I was a shushan in the palace is not Babylon it is the kingdom of what remember the Book of Esther it's the kingdom of the Persian so he's under baltaza he's under Babylon but God took him in Persia are we okay follow me carefully everybody okay I was in the palace which is in the province of Elam and I saw a vision and I was by the river Ule you live then I lift up my eyes and I sow and behold they stood before me before the river and water ran a ram which had how many horns two horns they cannot continue Kingdom of Russia Isabel but we know the bear have two sides remember one that is stronger that destroyed Babylon with holding the Trinity of Babylon but not the other side everybody here so when the bear is rising he's rising in one side he's not using the other everybody okay everybody okay can I say something again if I do this Imam make you think like this foot is shorter than the other yeah everybody okay why are you saying that can you go back here with me verse three and then I lift up my eyes and I saw behold that stood before me a ram which had two horns and the two one but one was what then the water do you understand why I say that everybody okay so the bear has two sides one side seems to be stronger than the other amen now we found that there is a realm that's why I told you follow me and the ham have how many horns two horns but one horn is higher than the other before we go what is a Horner brother we found the realm.com the realm is by the river brother Branham helped me he says a horn means water a kingdom one we have been through that a haunt means water everybody okay so there is two Kingdom or two power that are coming up with this one we okay one is higher they are the one is tall long but it's not that higher in other words it's a little bit shorter than the other one everybody okay I'm in verse uh God gracious I'm in verse three but one that was higher than the other and the higher came up what so the kingdom start with the the weakest part but the end of that Kingdom the highest part would take over amen everybody okay do you follow me if you look at Russia this Christian but the one who's dominating is the one percent he's the one that is stronger he's the one the entire world is afraid of you okay brother Stephen why do you put the Ram with the bear jump to verse 20. job we first turning are you there are you there uh-huh are you there are you there only few people are you there are we there sister we there okay can I go that Ram with you sir having water Kings of the water media and water so this Kingdom can be a bear and a ram the twofold of the silver Kingdom everybody okay right shall have a bad part hmm and 99 is a good part do you follow me but when you talk about Russia the one part is the one always dominate that's what we talk about it's just putting putting but like there is nothing good in Russia are you since the bear the bear like there is no good within the bear but there is another fault of this Spirit it is also represented as a rhyme amen amen did I lose anybody did that lose anybody drop down to verse 4. I saw the ram pushing Westward and northward and suffering so the ram is fighting he's pushing he's extending his kingdom everybody okay so that no Beast must stand before him neither any Beast neither was there any that could deliver out of his hand but he did according to his will and became what great everybody okay now we if you remember this Kingdom of me the vision one side is a bay another it's a rainbow amen so now we are moving from a bear into a ram what is going on a bear is a Savage it's an Anthem it's a world but the realm is a domestic it's a term animal brother Branham he said put me seven rhymes on here what does the ram speak of any religious teacher knows that the ram spoke of water coming with Jesus everybody okay so there is a Christianity part and the major vision where do you see that go to Daniel chapter 6. actually five then we go to Six let's go to five I have to go this way so you don't get lost Daniel chapter 5 go to verse 30. you there the Bible said in that night was belchazza Babylon the king of the cuddling of the Cardinals sign and Darius the median took the kingdom being a bad true score and two years old Daniel wants them Babylon saw the middle pigeon took over is there anything good about the middle patient the one that destroyed Babylon was the bear but let's see the realm everybody okay everybody okay chapter now six verse 1. he please Darius Darius to set over the kingdom a 120 priests which should be over the whole Kingdom and over these three presidents somehow what the skin coming he picked Daniel the Prophet and put him as the top are we okay that the princess might give the country to them and the King should have no damage no loss then this Daniel was what above the president of prince and princess because of an excellent Spirit was in him and the King thought to set him over the water there was something in this King that loved Daniel there was something in this King in his spirit that love Daniel and he was already working to promote Daniel as a Joseph in peace [Music] everybody okay do you follow me verse 4 then the president and the Priestess sought to find occasion against Daniel concerning the kingdom but they could find water no occasion no fault for as much as he was what faithful neither was there any error of fault found in water job to verse 14. are you there they came they plotted they said Daniel the only way we can get him is underwater his religion amen they came and they made the King's son a pepper the king didn't understand the trick the King's son demanded and he was on he didn't know that he was for the destruction of Daniel when the king realized that he was Randy was Daniel [Music] what happened verse 14. then the King when he heard this word he was so displeased with himself and set his heart on water to the water and he never till the going down of the waters to do what deliver him what was in this King that loved Daniel which side is working the bear is ungodly the bear is a hidden he doesn't like Christianity can I continue jump to verse 16. then the king commanded and they brought Daniel and cast him into the denim in the den of lion watch carefully now the king spoke and said to Daniel your God whom you wanted can you read your scripture whom you serve continually [Music] was it a believer so something cannot continue can I continue So Daniel was living a life in Babylon that this life become a thunder [Applause] cannot continue for the king of Babylon until the king begin to believe the god of Daniel and when danger is in trouble he said I remember seeing you going to church every day when you work here you always say this is Wednesday I'm gonna go to church this is Wednesday I'm gonna go to church may your God that you serve I see you different than welcome every worker is bad but you have a sweet spiritual work you're always nice to people you always comfort me I've seen something in you that I love it is not just a bear

King seal it with his own Signet and with the Signet of his Lord that the purpose might not be watered concerning who change can I continue jump to verse 18. you ready then the king went to sleep to his Palace can I continue then the king went to his Palace and passed his night eating doing water fasting who taught that King too fast can we continue fasting neither were instrument of Music brought before him and his sleep went from him why because of who is this a bear bear hate Christianity everybody okay job to verse 24. amen amen let me see I mean let me see a job to verse 20 and then we go to 24 2019. then the king arose very what early in the morning and went out when it was six o'clock the king forgot even his uh his shoes he began to go quickly they said King you need your shoes bring it to me in another chariot why Daniel what was in Daniel that caught the king like this everybody okay he went in heads to the lion then verse 20 and when he came to the den he cried with the water lemon terrible voice to Daniel and the King's said to Daniel oh Daniel what servant of what the Living God I thought this King was a hidden who taught him the Living God 99 are not Barbarian everybody okay everybody okay servant of the Living God is your god whom you serve continually able to deliver you from The Lion then from The Lion then said Daniel to the king or King live for what amen going into the dance of a lion is considered death [Applause] can you understand me no one ever getting that done and ever came out everybody that they put in that Den that was the end of it in other words the lion then was death he defeated every person but one day there was a prophet everybody here everybody here when that Prophet went there he and death begin to talk [Music] do you follow me do you follow me and the prophet overcome death and he came out when nobody ever came out he was the son of the Resurrection [Applause] because everybody died but one day there was a man called Jesus Christ when he went into the tomb after three days he came out from the tomb he defiled gifts and hell and the quest [Applause] thank you everybody okay everybody okay so Daniel demonstrated the power of Resurrection [Music] hey everybody okay everybody okay that's why Paul say when we preach the gospel we're not preaching in word only but we preach with the demonstration I wanna know him in the power of his resurrection because the power of Resurrection is what catches the believer what's up everybody care everybody care so when the king So Daniel coming up he saw a man resurrecting from the dead because when you get there it's death but this one went into the grave and came back alive what is the king gonna do is he going to be a believer is he going to be a believer is he going to make his confession let's see what he's going to do job to verse 24. all right oh my God are you there are you there jump to verse 25 for the sake of time amen you there then King Darius wrote to what all people and water and what languages that dwell in water peaceful multiply to you and make a degree that in every Dominion of my kingdom men do water and water fear before who the god of the Lord for he is [Music] instead fast forward in his kingdom that which shall not be watered his Dominion shall be even to the water he delivers and rescues and he works water and water who taught him this thing Glory the king begin to preach the gospel using books using letters stand all over the world preaching the gospel coming from the King that you must respect this God this God is the Living God it is not just a bear there is a ram path to this Kingdom it is not just a communist man there is a part of a Christian side how are you Lord did I lose you he said he rescued and they wander in heaven and on Earth who has delivered Daniel from the power of the water so Daniel prosper in the reign of the riots and in the reign of savage the water he was not just a bad Kingdom let's go back to Daniel 8. can I continue that's why brother Branham made such a statement he says about one-third or two-thirds of the population of United States goes to church and his church member but they control in those domination they are in those denominations what communism need over there is a voice of God rise up among them and it will be put towards shame in Finland when that little boy was raised from the dead that day and they was bringing me three square away where this little fellow was raised up the Dead the rising up of the Dead did something to the king brother Branham went to Finland roused the little boy from the dead what is he gonna do to the middle vision of today Spirits don't die Spirit don't die history repeats itself what is he gonna do today nowadays more than the middle patient brother Branham said communist Soldier Russia standing there with the righteous salute and the water Jesus because they saw the resurrection all right they saw the power of Resurrection like Darius saw the power of resurrection and they said we will water we and God duck and water a God that can put Daniel and put Daniel from The Lion then we will receive that God just like Darius received the god everybody okay it is the negligence of the water and the water and knows water they are talking all about all about the water and building water and giving the people and the same thing happened in this message foreign [Music] organization the building move they're building big names and the people have nothing what Russia need is the water to do water because Daniel was a prophet if you can give them one they will pick it up everybody okay rise on the sand with the water that can shut the water now why shut them off because they shut the mouth of the lion before 99 cents if you bring a prophetic and they receive it they will take over the other one everybody okay everybody okay glory to God Brother Brad I'm saying right your soldier standing there at the Russian salute peer running down their cheek they say we shall receive a god like that that has power to raise the dead what caused communism we shall receive a god like that I have seen Russia Soldier put their arm around the water and do what and do water enemies anything that shall make a Russia party theme or a fin party Russia will do whatever what did that was the anointing and the brother Branham can I continue let's go to Daniel 8. you understand the realm everybody okay we okay verse 5. and I was considering behold the water we're coming from Iran we understand the REM now you understand that Russia is not Russia all too bad it is the communism part that God is using to burn the hallot but there is a part that is a rampart there is a bread that will come out of Russia a small portion that will be taken out from there because out of every Kingdom every Kingdom Every Nation there is a bread in Russia and that little portion will receive the message and they already received the message and that portion will be pulled out that portion of the ram which is connected to the coming of the Lord [Applause] did I lost you did I lost you the man now we're dealing with a goat a male goat Lord help me Jesus Christ let me try my best okay okay all right let's go because this is tough here verse five and I was considering before the he got came from West on the face of the Earth and touch not to the water ground so this goat was doing one flying have you seen a godfly before I help you up let's go to verse 21. then I'm gonna help you how is he flying you there you there if you're verse 21 you can say amen amen and the rough goat is taking of what Gracia and the Great Horn that is between his eyes is the water first king stop duh big this God is the king of Grisha but remember when we look at the Greek amen the Greek was the water what was in his back Wings what do you do with wings why is this God flying why is this God flying every scripture ever body okay the goat doesn't fly like that it is another manifestation let me help you out because your boss just reminded me yes they made operation is a bear the middle pigeon is around Jesus Christ is a lamb and Jesus Christ is also a lion but it's the same person it's just two different manifestations the red dragon and the old serpent which is the devil and Satan it can be a dragon or he can be a serpent it is the same person it is a God it is a leopard it is the same Kingdom but the God is flying because when you check the leopard you will see Wings on the back of the leopard that is what is making the goat fly any question let's go back again to verse 5. glory to God Amen and touching not and the God had a notable horn between his eyes which we saw that he was the first king which was Alexander the Great amen verse 6 and he came to the realm that had two on which I had sinned standing before the river and run to him in Fury of his power and I saw him come close to the realm and he was moved with Cole angry bitterness against him and smoked the ram stop watch carefully the goat never attacked the bear do you follow me God cannot attack bear even a horse cannot move where he buries anybody here they go to uses the easy part of the Kingdom he attacked the rampart did you follow me he didn't attack the Bell the Bell will destroy the the the the uh the goat quickly everybody okay he's attacking the realm everybody okay job to verse seven and there was no power in the realm to stand before him but he cast him down to the ground and step upon him and there was none that could deliver the realm Out of Heaven the Kingdom of Middle prison fell he fell by a goat remember that the God is what destroys the realm you're gonna see who's the goat everybody okay everybody okay verse 9 then the God works very great the kingdom increase and when he was strong the Great Horn was water Alexander the Great was killed I'm trying to save time amen and for it came water stop let's go back to the leopard how many head have developer but at the beginning they were all hooked together it was one power because Alexander had four General that was fighting for him but after the death of Alexander the Great the kingdom was divided in four that's why they have four wings and four head there were four General Andy Alexander the Great who was the horn everybody okay it's a book of Daniel that's how it is everybody okay he say verse 8 and they go towards very good and when he was strong the Great Horn was broken and he came up four notable one two of the Four Winds of water Heaven amen you there everybody clear hold here go to Daniel 11. Lord help me Hallelujah amen amen are you there first one Daniel 11 is more complicated than you think also in the first year of the Rios the meeting I even I stood confirmed to confirm and to strengthen him Daniel was doing that the king loved him and now will I show you the truth behold they shall stand up three kings in Persia and the fourth shall be father Rich than all then they all and by his strength through his riches he shall stir up against the realm of what so the fourth King will do something that will cause Alexander to come against him amen verse 3 and a mighty king shall stand up and that shall rule with great Dominion Alexander the Great and do according to his will and when he shall stand up his kingdom shall be watered broken and shall be divided toward the water four ways four wings of Heaven you see four again because it's the Greek Empire and not to his posterity because Alexander died with a baby he didn't have a hair not according to his Dominion which he rule for his kingdom shall be platter even for other beside water so Alexander goes to four because he was four head put together when the king is gone alone he divided Four Kings taken any question let's go back to Daniel chapter eight and then we run to the airport I can't reach where I want to go if you're there you can say Amen the first Dual Purpose remember Greek is a leopard but Greek also is a goat those two Kingdom have Duo vote they have a compound meaning they can be good and leopard this one can be bear and RAM what does he have to do with you amen verse 9 you there when the kingdom was divided by four general of Alexander what happened and out of one of them one of the general came forth a what a little horn which was exceedingly what great my brother is there toward the South toward the East and toward the water the pleasant land is another name for Israel so the last Kingdom that followed the Greek kingdom was the kingdom of Rome you remember but he came here as a little horn and it's going straight toward Israel everybody okay now let's go to verse 10. and he watched great this horn what I want you to remember it is the goat that destroyed the realm and it's out of the goat horn that made way for Rome Rome was birthed from the goat do you follow me I'm gonna go somewhere then hit the airport it's a military airplane hang on Amen verse 10 and he works great even to the host of water this little horn came so great until he went all the way to heaven amen watch with me and he did what my brother I need volume and he did what cast down cast down Waters some of the water and of the waters to the water does he ring a bell does he win the bear does he win the best somewhere does he ring a bell I see the red dragon having seven horns and water and seven Crown upon him and he still drew the water of the star of water and cast them to the water so which is this horn you need to know how to read the scripture he uses different symbols but it's the same spirit everybody okay he cuts down some of the hosts of the star to the ground and stamp them upon them yeah he magnified himself even to the priests of the host which is Jesus and by him the water the daily sacrifice the 70 weeks of Daniel the damage sacrifice was what taken away and the place of his Sanctuary was water yes when Jesus was killed that this came and destroyed the temple and stopped the sacrifice of God who did that room so Rome was birthed from Greece everybody okay everybody okay job to verse 8 12. and a horse was giving him against the deadly Sacrifice by reason of transgression because the Jews sin and he cast down the water who is the truth I am the truth the way and uh he cuts down Jesus Christ amen to the ground like a rose trample on the ground amen any practice and prosper then I heard one of the Saints speaking to another sin saying to a certain scent which spoke how long shall this Vision be anybody okay job I'm gonna skip this because of time and see where I can drop here amen oh my God let me see again job to verse 25 and I'm gonna try to skip this because it's again deeper I don't want to lose somebody amen and through his policy also he shall cause crap to prosper in Israel he shall magnify himself in his heart Lucifer and by peace the pope very good shall destroy many and he shall also stand up against the Prince of Peace Jesus Christ but he shall be broken without water remember that storm that was coming down with that hand so what I'm trying to say here is that this God was the one that generated the kingdom of Rome but Ibraham says that the star of Heaven represents the spirit of man and when the red dragon Roam and there is persecution had the thirds of the star and cast them down there was at the water crucified the crucifixion of the Lord Jesus Christ when they rejected him and they cast him and had nothing to do with him there was that third part of angelic star Angelic water so my point here is out of the Greek Empire camera but this Kingdom Isabel it can be around this one is a goat and it's a leopard and it's the one that gave birth to Rome Rome didn't come out of the leopard he have the leopard on himself in Revelation 11 I mean 13 but the one who birthed him was one of the goat horns amen what are you trying to say I'm gonna skip this amen we know that Greek there is something specific about Greek right the Bible says that the Jews require a son cannot continue now hang on put your seat belt I'm gonna head to the airport because my time is up everybody okay the Greek we got the Jews we require water and the Greeks seek after water wisdom Greek seek after wisdom the Greek Empire is an Empire that is after wisdom but we know that there is two kind of wisdom everybody okay there is a wisdom of God which is Christ and there is another wisdom which is of the devil and the wisdom of the world amen which wisdom does the Greek seek Paul says that your faith should not stand in the wisdom of man but in the water power of God habit we speak wisdom among them that are perfect yet not the wisdom of what the world none of the places of water that comes water this wisdom descended not from heaven but it's water it's water and it's water so the Greek out the people that seek after the devil's wisdom cannot continue Paul went to ask him and the Bible says that we are Paul waited for for them at our sin his Spirit was turned in him when he saw the city only given to water Paul enter into the city everywhere he see his adults adults adults Paul say what is going on with the Greek with so many gods like this hang on I'm going to the airport then certain philosopher of the Epicurean and the stoic encounter him and some say what will this water they call poly blubber can I continue he always speak blah blah blah everybody here are there some he seems to be sadder for uh for a water because he preached unto them Jesus and the water when you bring the resurrection to the middle pigeon they accept it everybody okay when you bring Resurrection to the Greek they make fun of you amen they look at Paul they say hey we have a platform that we usually talk come on let's take you to the platform it's called Mars Hill in the Bible it's called aeropagis or something and they took and brought him onto aeropagus saying may we know what this new doctrine whereof that speaker

Place driving our car May our mind be always United with you father so that you can speak to us you can see that we need to fix to remove every single little thing so that you don't find in US a form
