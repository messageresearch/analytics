[58:59] matthew 25 verse 14. if you're there you

[59:20] somebody driving from far off get on
[59:22] time in church
[59:24] fill in the blank
[59:29] if i feel it you'll be screaming
[59:33] get the church in time
[59:38] you heard it
[59:39] if you're there you can say amen
[59:41] for the kingdom of heaven
[59:44] is as a man
[59:47] traveling into a far country
[59:51] who called his own servants
[59:54] and delivered to them
[59:56] his goods
[59:59] everybody okay
[1:00:01] and to the one
[1:00:03] he gave
[1:00:04] five talent
[1:00:07] one
[1:00:08] how many servants
[1:00:10] want to put three here
[1:00:12] the first one he gave him five talent
[1:00:16] everybody here
[1:00:18] then
[1:00:20] to another
[1:00:22] two
[1:00:24] everybody
[1:00:25] two talent
[1:00:28] and the other one
[1:00:32] why did he give them
[1:00:34] different
[1:00:36] numbers
[1:00:38] why not giving them all five talent or
[1:00:41] two talent or one talent
[1:00:44] verse 15 and to one he gave five talent
[1:00:48] to another two
[1:00:50] and to another one
[1:00:54] to every man
[1:00:57] according
[1:00:58] to his several that word several means
[1:01:01] owner
[1:01:03] according to his own ability
[1:01:07] everybody
[1:01:08] so when the master
[1:01:11] was looking at his servant
[1:01:13] he found indoor servant certain
[1:01:17] potential
[1:01:19] certain ability
[1:01:23] everybody care and potential everybody
[1:01:26] here
[1:01:27] and based on your ability
[1:01:30] or based on your potential
[1:01:32] the master give you his goods
[1:01:35] he entrusted you with something as a
[1:01:38] steward
[1:01:40] everybody here
[1:01:41] you must say no why am i getting one and
[1:01:44] he got five
[1:01:45] he knows why he gave you one
[1:01:49] and he gave another one father
[1:01:51] amen when he gives you five you need to
[1:01:54] understand his language
[1:02:00] if he gives you a certain husband
[1:02:06] anybody here
[1:02:07] he knows why what he's doing
[1:02:19] [Laughter]
[1:02:22] and immediately
[1:02:24] took his journey
[1:02:26] so he has confidence
[1:02:29] in those people if he didn't have
[1:02:31] confidence why is he going to take his
[1:02:33] good and entrust it to somebody knowing
[1:02:35] that they're going to spend it
[1:02:38] it's up to the one who received to
[1:02:40] understand that if the boss is giving me
[1:02:43] this he have confidence in me
[1:02:46] everybody care
[1:02:49] praise be the name of the lord verse 16
[1:02:52] then he
[1:02:53] that received the five talent
[1:02:56] went and traded with the same
[1:03:00] and made them
[1:03:01] other how many
[1:03:05] so the one who had five talent
[1:03:09] when he
[1:03:10] put himself
[1:03:12] into work anybody care
[1:03:15] he has a 100 percent
[1:03:19] return
[1:03:22] everybody care
[1:03:24] about here and that 100 to return gave
[1:03:28] him five talent anybody here
[1:03:31] and it looks like
[1:03:33] after he gained five talent
[1:03:36] the potential stuck
[1:03:43] let's continue
[1:03:46] let's go to verse 17.
[1:03:48] and likewise
[1:03:50] he that received two
[1:03:52] ever care
[1:03:54] he also gained at the water oh my god so
[1:03:59] the two have a hundred percent also
[1:04:02] returned when it comes it comes back to
[1:04:06] two
[1:04:06] everybody here
[1:04:08] it looks like
[1:04:10] whatever the boss put in
[1:04:14] he always it's already have a threshold
[1:04:19] or a plateau
[1:04:22] anybody here in other words you cannot
[1:04:25] go beyond your ability
[1:04:29] anybody here
[1:04:30] if you still if they give you five
[1:04:33] talent and you have one
[1:04:35] you are still having time to work
[1:04:38] everybody here everybody here
[1:04:41] if you have two your age is still
[1:04:43] working
[1:04:47] if you have three the age the grace is
[1:04:49] still open
[1:04:52] if you have four your grace is open
[1:04:55] once you reach five
[1:04:58] you cannot go anymore
[1:05:01] and the one who have two once you reach
[1:05:03] two that say the one who have two cannot
[1:05:06] have five
[1:05:09] amen
[1:05:10] amen am i reading a different bible so
[1:05:12] if you go to the one that have two and
[1:05:15] try to pull five you will never get a
[1:05:17] five
[1:05:18] because his ability is only two
[1:05:25] you can pray all you want
[1:05:31] okay you can fast all you want
[1:05:35] two will remain two
[1:05:39] if two is one
[1:05:41] when you're praying you're doing good
[1:05:44] once to reach two plateau
[1:05:47] in other words somebody's moving like
[1:05:49] this then
[1:05:51] they're remaining
[1:05:53] until he's gone
[1:05:54] no more
[1:05:59] hallelujah
[1:06:01] verse 18 but he that has won
[1:06:07] and dug in the earth so if he had one
[1:06:11] automatically he he was given the
[1:06:13] potential to multiply and bring another
[1:06:16] one
[1:06:17] he just didn't know
[1:06:19] he got so caught up it's a lot of work
[1:06:22] amen they cannot give you more than you
[1:06:25] can be
[1:06:28] it's not work for you it's going to work
[1:06:30] be work for somebody else not you
[1:06:34] anybody here
[1:06:36] dug in the earth
[1:06:37] and heed the lord's water
[1:06:40] so these talents are money
[1:06:47] everybody here
[1:06:48] and money brother branham say it's a
[1:06:51] purchase
[1:06:52] power
[1:06:54] everyone here you remember
[1:06:56] which brother ranam say was
[1:06:59] symbolizing faith
[1:07:02] here
[1:07:03] so does faith have limitation
[1:07:10] you need a prophet to decode
[1:07:12] anybody care when it starts it's good
[1:07:16] when you reach each plateau it's not
[1:07:18] going to go any further than that
[1:07:21] somebody else need to pick up with a
[1:07:23] different number
[1:07:29] let's go to luke chapter 12.
[1:07:35] oh my god this message when you preach
[1:07:38] it you have a different language
[1:07:46] it's like yesterday you pulled a
[1:07:47] scripture and the sister said wow i
[1:07:50] didn't know this was in the bible it was
[1:07:52] right here
[1:07:55] it's the message of the hour
[1:07:57] luke 12
[1:07:59] verse 48.
[1:08:01] if you dare you can say amen
[1:08:04] oh my god but he
[1:08:06] that
[1:08:08] knew not and then
[1:08:10] commit things worthy of straps
[1:08:13] shall be beaten with few straps
[1:08:19] everybody here
[1:08:21] you didn't know
[1:08:22] so they're going to correct you
[1:08:24] according to your level of knowledge
[1:08:28] for to whomsoever much is given
[1:08:33] everybody care of him shall be much what
[1:08:37] if they give you five the boss is
[1:08:39] expecting five
[1:08:43] the return of the boss at the end
[1:08:45] you must be five if they give you two
[1:08:47] the boss is expecting two if they give
[1:08:50] you one he's expecting one everybody
[1:08:52] here
[1:08:53] and of him shall my it shall be much
[1:08:56] required and to whom men have committed
[1:08:59] much
[1:09:00] of him they will ask them all
[1:09:02] anybody care
[1:09:04] so
[1:09:05] this return that the boss is waiting
[1:09:08] depends on the input that the boss gave
[1:09:11] you anybody care there is a reason why
[1:09:14] the boss is giving you five
[1:09:17] when he gives you five means your
[1:09:20] abilities fav
[1:09:22] everybody clear
[1:09:23] let's pray heavenly father
[1:09:26] lord we thank you again father for your
[1:09:28] grace for your love for your mercy and
[1:09:31] for giving us another opportunity to be
[1:09:34] here standing before the precious
[1:09:37] pressures
[1:09:38] of the blood of jesus christ
[1:09:40] father we have done what any man that
[1:09:43] you give in an ability and the grace to
[1:09:45] read the word can do lord but when he
[1:09:48] comes to interpret
[1:09:50] the scripture and to unveil it to your
[1:09:52] children it's only the supernatural act
[1:09:55] of the holy spirit
[1:09:57] lord may you forgive your children for
[1:09:59] everything that they have done
[1:10:01] that could be a hindrance lord father
[1:10:03] for the service and their blessing lord
[1:10:06] we thank you for your presence this
[1:10:08] morning may you move us completely out
[1:10:10] of the way may you come and speak to
[1:10:12] your children may you shake those that
[1:10:15] the devil has been battling so much with
[1:10:18] them
[1:10:19] putting them to sleep every day when the
[1:10:21] world is going on father remove that
[1:10:24] demonic evil spirit from their life
[1:10:27] and may they stay awake and focus as we
[1:10:30] commit it all unto the hand and humbly
[1:10:32] humbly ask it lord in the name of jesus
[1:10:35] christ
[1:10:36] amen
[1:10:38] god bless you everybody ready
[1:10:40] all right
[1:10:41] the bible says in the book of hebrew
[1:10:44] chapter 10
[1:10:45] now the just shall live by faith
[1:10:50] but if any man draws back
[1:10:52] my soul shall have no pleasure in him
[1:10:56] but we are not of them that drove back
[1:11:00] unto perdition so going back like oppa
[1:11:04] you go into perdition
[1:11:06] but of them that believe
[1:11:10] to the water so we're going all the way
[1:11:15] everybody here when you started is the
[1:11:18] alpha and the omega
[1:11:21] anybody here there is no way you can get
[1:11:23] in the plane of alpha without reaching
[1:11:25] omega
[1:11:27] you're in a different plane amen
[1:11:29] now we're on part seven the four phases
[1:11:32] of roof
[1:11:34] at luther
[1:11:38] so we're going to talk about martin
[1:11:40] luther
[1:11:41] why
[1:11:42] martin luther
[1:11:44] brother branham says this just a
[1:11:46] reminder he said god has made it so
[1:11:49] wonderful
[1:11:51] that in the old testament
[1:11:53] he god
[1:11:55] where usually i go to for refuge for a
[1:11:59] text once in a while
[1:12:01] he's made the old testament in parables
[1:12:04] and in symbolic forms
[1:12:06] to express himself and his doings that
[1:12:10] the simple-minded
[1:12:13] might be able to have the conception of
[1:12:16] his will and what he is doing amen so
[1:12:20] god make it so plain so that everybody
[1:12:23] can see what is going on
[1:12:25] brother branham said that in the old
[1:12:27] testament now not the old testament
[1:12:30] everything now we're narrowing that down
[1:12:32] he said in the old testament
[1:12:35] being a top of the new
[1:12:36] and the work of the inward courts
[1:12:40] plural there is three courts
[1:12:42] we have the other court we have the holy
[1:12:44] place and we have the holiest anybody
[1:12:47] care
[1:12:48] the works of the inward courts of the
[1:12:50] tabernacle was a beautiful picture of
[1:12:54] god's plans of water
[1:12:57] now you begin to see that clearly now
[1:13:00] everybody here it was a beautiful
[1:13:02] picture of god's plans of salvation for
[1:13:05] his mankind today
[1:13:08] but here and if we can only learn by
[1:13:11] this now
[1:13:12] and how to get ourselves in the
[1:13:14] condition to receive what god has in
[1:13:17] store for us
[1:13:19] in that tabernacle it shall just sweep
[1:13:22] the whole valley here
[1:13:24] but don't you think it's better to
[1:13:26] always know how and what you're coming
[1:13:28] for
[1:13:29] you get to know the way of approach to
[1:13:32] anything that has been said we found out
[1:13:36] that in the tabernacle the plan of
[1:13:39] salvation has been unfolded to us
[1:13:42] now we know that the other court is
[1:13:44] justification
[1:13:46] the holy place is sanctification and the
[1:13:49] baptism of the holy spirit is the
[1:13:51] holiest everybody clear this is a
[1:13:54] tabernacle language
[1:13:57] or a tabernacle a priesthood language
[1:14:01] and but here if you look at first you
[1:14:03] don't understand what it means but when
[1:14:06] we begin to go on the detail we begin to
[1:14:08] see that the other court was speaking
[1:14:10] about repentance and water baptism
[1:14:13] then the holy place shall and then you
[1:14:16] have the gift of the holy spirit in the
[1:14:18] most holiest everybody clear when we
[1:14:21] took the tabernacle and converted into
[1:14:24] the story of roof
[1:14:26] you remember the conversion the
[1:14:28] conversion told us that roof was
[1:14:31] deciding in the other court
[1:14:33] roof was serving in the holy place and
[1:14:36] roof was resting in the most holy place
[1:14:39] everybody
[1:14:40] so everybody in this life
[1:14:44] have to fulfill the tabernacle
[1:14:47] because the tabernacle is the plan of
[1:14:50] redemption of god
[1:14:52] but here once you start in the
[1:14:54] tabernacle here you must repent
[1:14:57] you must be baptized and then you must
[1:15:00] be filled with the holy spirit and once
[1:15:03] you are filled with the holy spirit
[1:15:06] automatically your work is completed
[1:15:09] then your next step is adoption
[1:15:12] everybody here and that abduction will
[1:15:15] bring you to the change of the body
[1:15:17] which is the second banquet of esther
[1:15:21] why is this important
[1:15:25] brother branham said devil
[1:15:28] can get to you
[1:15:30] because when you complete the tabernacle
[1:15:33] you are shielding yourself
[1:15:36] from the devil
[1:15:38] everybody here
[1:15:40] once you are on the holiest place
[1:15:43] and you are still with the holy spirit
[1:15:46] brother branham said that seal cannot be
[1:15:48] tempered
[1:15:50] anybody care they usually take the box
[1:15:53] they're going to verify the box they're
[1:15:54] going to check the box they're going to
[1:15:56] put it up and down they're going to fill
[1:15:58] it pack it that's no problem but once
[1:16:00] the box is sealed
[1:16:04] and the inspection stamp is put there
[1:16:08] nobody can mess around with that seal
[1:16:11] that seal is guaranteed all the way to
[1:16:15] destination
[1:16:17] it can only be broken at destination
[1:16:20] so when you complete the tabernacle you
[1:16:23] are bringing a protection permanently
[1:16:27] between you and the devil
[1:16:33] hallelujah
[1:16:35] brother branham said therefore can get
[1:16:37] to you
[1:16:38] he can do it
[1:16:39] he has to come through the same process
[1:16:43] [Music]
[1:16:47] everybody okay
[1:16:48] remember judah entered the other court
[1:16:52] and judah was the devil incarnated
[1:16:55] judah entered the holy place
[1:16:58] and judah was the devil incarnated but
[1:17:01] when he was down for the holiest
[1:17:04] judah could not enter the holy spirit he
[1:17:07] dropped back and he died
[1:17:09] so the only way the devil cannot get to
[1:17:12] you you must go beyond the last step of
[1:17:16] judah
[1:17:16] [Music]
[1:17:18] everybody here you must get into the
[1:17:21] whole years because over there someone
[1:17:23] is living there
[1:17:25] and that person and the devil don't get
[1:17:28] along
[1:17:31] because he that is in you
[1:17:34] is greater than he that is in the world
[1:17:37] ever here
[1:17:39] in order for the devil to get there the
[1:17:42] devil have to go through the same door
[1:17:45] he must be justified he must be
[1:17:48] sanctified and the devil must receive
[1:17:51] the holy ghost
[1:17:55] and if the devil receives the holy ghost
[1:17:57] he cannot remain the devil
[1:18:00] because receiving that holy ghost bring
[1:18:03] conversion
[1:18:05] he will change the devil and burn the
[1:18:08] snake out of him
[1:18:10] then the devil is your brother
[1:18:17] hallelujah
[1:18:18] he said he can't get to you a man
[1:18:21] he can't come through that
[1:18:24] oh but you say brother branham i
[1:18:26] received the holy ghost yeah i eat the
[1:18:29] good i eat the good things of god yeah
[1:18:31] but you are in the court out yonder
[1:18:35] that is the reason you don't hold on
[1:18:40] everybody here that's the reason this
[1:18:42] year you are doing pretty good
[1:18:44] and the next year you are back in the
[1:18:46] world
[1:18:48] so you cannot be in church today
[1:18:51] and back sleep tomorrow and claim to
[1:18:53] have the holy ghost
[1:18:56] today you are a good christian tomorrow
[1:18:59] you in a hotel with a woman you don't
[1:19:02] have the holy ghost
[1:19:05] hallelujah
[1:19:06] and this revival you are doing fine
[1:19:10] while the revival is on when the revival
[1:19:12] is gone then you are gone somewhere else
[1:19:15] and out with the water
[1:19:17] you get in the presence of god like this
[1:19:19] morning everything is god oh praise the
[1:19:21] lord i feel i believe something happened
[1:19:23] this morning
[1:19:25] you go out
[1:19:26] they put a trial down
[1:19:28] you didn't get anything
[1:19:30] everybody here you say oh i received the
[1:19:33] holy ghost i spoke with tongues i'll
[1:19:36] shudder that's all right i have nothing
[1:19:39] to say about that but why don't you why
[1:19:42] don't it hold out
[1:19:47] you cannot let the holy spirit make you
[1:19:50] speak in tongues
[1:19:51] and doesn't change you
[1:19:57] tell the holy ghost please before i
[1:19:59] speak in tongues
[1:20:01] change my life first
[1:20:08] hallelujah
[1:20:10] that is what the world is looking at
[1:20:13] that is what the people are saying if
[1:20:16] you are professing this great high
[1:20:18] calling then why aren't you living like
[1:20:21] that
[1:20:23] i'm the bride of jesus christ i'm the
[1:20:25] bride of jesus christ look at the way
[1:20:27] you're living
[1:20:30] everybody here
[1:20:31] brother branham say you all have heard
[1:20:34] me say that people say the devil made me
[1:20:37] do this
[1:20:39] poor devil
[1:20:40] you were the one who started you want to
[1:20:42] blame it on the devil
[1:20:44] anybody here no no the devil didn't do
[1:20:48] it
[1:20:49] you just was not water
[1:20:52] because when you are sailing you are
[1:20:54] protected
[1:20:59] i hope you're gonna wake up
[1:21:01] everybody here
[1:21:02] because when you are silting he is water
[1:21:06] you cannot mix the two together
[1:21:09] it's like oil and water
[1:21:12] you can take them and mix it and shake
[1:21:14] them if you leave them alone you see
[1:21:16] they're all going back up in the water
[1:21:17] going down
[1:21:19] they don't get along
[1:21:21] hallelujah
[1:21:23] he said now you went out to him
[1:21:27] he could not get into you because the
[1:21:30] only way to get into you is to come
[1:21:33] through the water
[1:21:34] the same process that you have
[1:21:37] he would have to be
[1:21:41] can you save the devil
[1:21:43] sanctify
[1:21:45] this savage justification
[1:21:48] you have not finished it
[1:21:50] and then sanctify and fill with the
[1:21:52] water
[1:21:53] you didn't receive the holy spirit when
[1:21:56] you were saved
[1:21:59] have you received the holy spirit since
[1:22:02] you believed
[1:22:04] that's the problem in the message i
[1:22:06] believe the message of the hour i'm
[1:22:08] justified sanctify with the old you're
[1:22:10] going to find yourself in a hotel
[1:22:15] everybody care you're fooling yourself
[1:22:17] up everybody here then he'll be your
[1:22:20] brother
[1:22:22] if he's sanctified filled with the holy
[1:22:24] spirit then he'll be your brother so you
[1:22:26] see he didn't do that no you just went
[1:22:29] to the borderline and come back lasting
[1:22:33] for the things of the water
[1:22:35] you never went all the way over into
[1:22:38] water
[1:22:39] into the hole yes you see across what
[1:22:42] the depth to self remember elijah and
[1:22:45] elisha justification sanctification then
[1:22:48] the cross jordan that's where the holy
[1:22:50] spirit came upon elijah
[1:22:52] not before jordan they have to cross
[1:22:55] jordan
[1:22:56] then elijah turn around and say what do
[1:22:58] you want
[1:23:00] i want your anointing the anointing
[1:23:02] cannot be given before jordan you have
[1:23:05] to be given bass jordan in the promised
[1:23:08] land
[1:23:10] ever here when elijah came back there
[1:23:13] elijah when elisha came back from there
[1:23:16] elijah was no longer there he didn't
[1:23:18] need elijah anymore he was looking for
[1:23:20] the god of elijah
[1:23:25] everybody here so far so when you enter
[1:23:28] into the holy of holies you shield
[1:23:30] yourself from the devil if not if the
[1:23:33] devil still have access on you you're
[1:23:36] still falling
[1:23:37] you're still backsliding back and forth
[1:23:40] it is a signal that you not sell yet
[1:23:45] everybody here so far we found roof now
[1:23:48] was under justification already because
[1:23:51] ruth entered through judah and then he
[1:23:54] went into the present altar and roof
[1:23:56] went all the way to the left because she
[1:23:58] say that where you die i'll die where
[1:24:02] you bury i'll be buried which is
[1:24:05] speaking about the resurrection death
[1:24:07] burial resurrection which is the word of
[1:24:10] baptism
[1:24:11] everybody here this water baptist here
[1:24:14] baptism here is essential
[1:24:18] because john the baptist taught jesus i
[1:24:21] mean jesus taught john the baptist we
[1:24:23] must fulfill all righteousness
[1:24:26] in other words normally you're not even
[1:24:27] supposed to be baptized jesus said no no
[1:24:30] no no according to the tap in the
[1:24:32] tabernacle a lamb must be washed
[1:24:35] and i'm the lamb i must fulfill the
[1:24:37] righteousness you gotta take me to some
[1:24:39] water to the level and baptize me and we
[1:24:42] found out when jesus being baptized and
[1:24:45] praying
[1:24:46] and back here automatically jesus moved
[1:24:49] to the holy place then the holy spirit
[1:24:51] picked him up and put him in the holiest
[1:24:53] and jesus received the holy spirit he
[1:24:55] started from christ first everybody
[1:24:58] brother branham said watch this stern
[1:25:00] apostle paul
[1:25:01] according to the believer in acts 19.
[1:25:04] he said
[1:25:05] but john only baptized unto repentance
[1:25:09] not for remission of sin because the
[1:25:11] sacrifice has not been killed everybody
[1:25:14] and when they heard this they were
[1:25:16] re-baptized in the name of jesus christ
[1:25:20] and the holy ghost came upon them
[1:25:22] now what did this do this is the lesson
[1:25:27] show that these people who were
[1:25:30] predestinated unto life
[1:25:32] as soon as they saw the scriptural truth
[1:25:36] they walk in the truth and receive the
[1:25:39] reward of a believer
[1:25:42] when god opens up something new to you
[1:25:46] everybody here
[1:25:47] you cannot stay in the state that you
[1:25:50] are
[1:25:51] you must quickly move from where you are
[1:25:54] and jump into what god is opening
[1:25:57] if you stay where you are you're gonna
[1:25:59] die
[1:26:01] you have to move completely into
[1:26:03] something when they talk disbeliever
[1:26:06] that you need to be re-baptized they
[1:26:07] didn't argue
[1:26:09] they got re-baptized and automatically
[1:26:11] the holy spirit came in
[1:26:13] it was another door that the lord opened
[1:26:16] and they were quick to respond and move
[1:26:18] on
[1:26:19] anybody care so far the holy ghost came
[1:26:22] upon them and they spoke in tongues
[1:26:24] prophesy and magnify god amen
[1:26:28] brother bonham said you might have left
[1:26:31] him at the baptism
[1:26:33] at the level you might have left him at
[1:26:35] the holy ghost
[1:26:37] you might have left him somewhere else
[1:26:39] we don't know whether in the outer court
[1:26:41] or holy place or whatever you give them
[1:26:43] wherever you left him don't take this
[1:26:45] her breathing church stuff
[1:26:47] there is only one to represent you this
[1:26:49] morning for salvation
[1:26:51] you don't have to be a sinner
[1:26:53] you don't have to be that
[1:26:55] you are if you are
[1:26:57] god don't hold you responsible for being
[1:27:00] a sinner
[1:27:02] everybody okay
[1:27:03] he won't hold you responsible from now
[1:27:06] on
[1:27:08] but he's going to hurt you is possible
[1:27:11] if you reject this
[1:27:16] if you were doing things before this
[1:27:19] teaching here in this church
[1:27:22] god winked on him
[1:27:24] from now on that you know the plan of
[1:27:27] redemption god won't play game with you
[1:27:30] anymore
[1:27:33] this is not something for you to learn
[1:27:36] like a head knowledge and forget
[1:27:38] [Music]
[1:27:40] to whom it's much given
[1:27:43] anybody okay
[1:27:45] they're going to ask you more
[1:27:47] at the beginning you didn't know any
[1:27:49] better
[1:27:50] god will forgive you but from now on
[1:27:55] everybody here
[1:27:57] he is not going to hurt you responsible
[1:28:00] because that may be in the past that you
[1:28:03] didn't know any different from water
[1:28:05] baptism
[1:28:06] you were not instructed before you were
[1:28:08] confused in the message this one said
[1:28:11] the baptism of the holy ghost this one
[1:28:12] said holy ghost this one says two this
[1:28:14] one says separate things everybody
[1:28:16] confused no problem from receiving the
[1:28:19] holy ghost and the power of god he might
[1:28:22] not hold you responsible for that you
[1:28:24] didn't know you might not have heard it
[1:28:26] before
[1:28:28] but from here on
[1:28:31] you know better
[1:28:32] come back to the water
[1:28:34] come back to who
[1:28:36] once god unfolds something to you you
[1:28:39] doom
[1:28:41] you have to do what he told you
[1:28:43] if you don't then you reject what is he
[1:28:45] saying amen
[1:28:47] now somebody asked me this question
[1:28:49] toward the end last
[1:28:52] sunday it was somebody who have
[1:28:54] questioned and came back so i felt like
[1:28:56] i need to put this again
[1:28:58] i was baptized at 13
[1:29:01] shall i be baptized again
[1:29:03] according to the scripture the one who
[1:29:06] were re-baptized did not know the
[1:29:08] correct baptism of jesus christ so if
[1:29:11] you are not baptized in the name of
[1:29:14] jesus christ you must be re-baptized
[1:29:17] again if you were baptized in the name
[1:29:19] of the father son holy ghost that's
[1:29:21] wrong you must be re-baptized again but
[1:29:24] what about if i was baptized in the name
[1:29:26] of jesus christ when i was younger
[1:29:29] should that be re-baptized again now
[1:29:31] that i know the truth
[1:29:36] amen brother brother he said if you have
[1:29:40] been a christian all along
[1:29:43] since you was 13 years old a believer in
[1:29:46] christ i just remain like you are
[1:29:51] if you were baptized at 13 years old
[1:29:54] and from 13 years old now you are 18 you
[1:29:57] are living a christian life you don't
[1:29:59] have to be re-baptized
[1:30:01] everybody okay
[1:30:03] but if you were baptized at 13 years old
[1:30:06] and you start going out and sleeping
[1:30:09] with women
[1:30:10] smoking going to the nightclub and
[1:30:12] sleeping on
[1:30:14] your beginning your brazen altar was
[1:30:16] wrong
[1:30:17] you must go back again and correct
[1:30:20] things
[1:30:22] brother branham said i would not
[1:30:24] now if god has blessed you and give you
[1:30:26] the water
[1:30:28] so if you were baptized at 13
[1:30:31] and maybe at 14 years old or 13 or 15
[1:30:34] god gave you the holy ghost you don't
[1:30:37] have because god already sanctioned you
[1:30:39] he told you that i'm okay with your
[1:30:41] baptism
[1:30:42] everybody here but you were baptized at
[1:30:45] 13
[1:30:46] you are 21 no holy ghost
[1:30:49] something is missing somewhere
[1:30:51] you need to recalibrate your walk
[1:30:54] jesus is coming
[1:30:56] back here but now if you have been if
[1:30:59] you've been redeemed and you feel that
[1:31:01] the blood of jesus christ cleans you
[1:31:03] from sin then you will live a christian
[1:31:06] life
[1:31:07] i will not think it will be necessary
[1:31:09] but if you want to all right i'll be
[1:31:11] fine we'll be glad to do it
[1:31:13] if you were blessed god move on with you
[1:31:16] he gave you the holy spirit fine blessed
[1:31:19] be the name of the lord but if your life
[1:31:20] has been up and down up and down up and
[1:31:23] down up and down until you smoke you do
[1:31:25] all kinds of stuff you need to
[1:31:27] recalibrate yourself
[1:31:29] maybe you missed something at the brazen
[1:31:30] altar anybody here brother branham said
[1:31:33] the man that baptized me in the name of
[1:31:35] the lord jesus christ finally ran me out
[1:31:37] of the church
[1:31:39] because i would not agree with me on
[1:31:41] women preachers
[1:31:42] that didn't make me re-baptize again
[1:31:46] why because brother branham remained
[1:31:48] christian
[1:31:49] everybody okay so far so if you have a
[1:31:51] question check your life how are you
[1:31:54] living since you got the baptism
[1:31:56] at 12 years old eight years old were you
[1:31:59] doing good or were you back sleeping
[1:32:01] slagging or going on pornography left
[1:32:03] and right you need to go back everybody
[1:32:05] care so far now when we look at this
[1:32:07] tabernacle here
[1:32:09] we position roof under justification
[1:32:12] roof deciding sanctification serving and
[1:32:15] baptism of the holy ghost in the holiest
[1:32:17] place roof resting
[1:32:19] now brother branham says this
[1:32:21] that on the inside of this intercourt
[1:32:27] we know that the tabernacle have
[1:32:31] the other court
[1:32:32] yes
[1:32:33] here
[1:32:34] then the holy place
[1:32:36] everybody
[1:32:37] then the holiest
[1:32:38] how many furniture do we have in the
[1:32:40] other place
[1:32:42] two furniture
[1:32:44] we have the
[1:32:45] the brazen altar
[1:32:48] praise god and we have the level
[1:32:51] if you notice after this there is
[1:32:54] nothing else
[1:32:57] anybody here so when you enter the other
[1:33:00] court
[1:33:01] and you go to the present altar
[1:33:04] and when you finish the president and
[1:33:05] you are baptized
[1:33:07] you have reached the plateau
[1:33:11] of the other court
[1:33:12] there is nothing else you can do
[1:33:16] the longer you stay in the other court
[1:33:19] there is nothing else that's going to be
[1:33:21] accomplished again
[1:33:26] amen
[1:33:31] can i repeat it again
[1:33:34] when you get in the other court
[1:33:37] hallelujah
[1:33:38] there is still furniture there
[1:33:41] in other words there is only two steps
[1:33:44] everybody here the most important step
[1:33:47] is the brazen altar
[1:33:50] anybody care because the brazen altar
[1:33:53] can take you to heaven
[1:33:55] at certain circumstances
[1:33:58] anybody here brother branham say if you
[1:34:01] are on the bed death at the hospital or
[1:34:05] in the hospice and you just about to go
[1:34:08] you can get in the breast and altar and
[1:34:11] go straight to heaven
[1:34:12] because you don't have much time and
[1:34:14] this is what happened to the fifa the
[1:34:16] cross he they could not bring him down
[1:34:20] to baptize him and matter of fact water
[1:34:23] baptism is only an outward expression of
[1:34:26] something that already happened at the
[1:34:28] present altar so the most important is
[1:34:31] the breast and altar but the word
[1:34:34] baptism is essential to show the people
[1:34:37] that you are on the side of the lord
[1:34:39] and once you finish these two furniture
[1:34:42] here there is nothing else you can do
[1:34:45] here
[1:34:46] you reach your climax
[1:34:50] and if you stay there longer you just
[1:34:52] walking around
[1:34:54] under justification under justification
[1:34:57] but remember under justification
[1:35:00] the snake is still there
[1:35:02] and the snake is active
[1:35:05] everybody here so the longer you stay in
[1:35:09] the other coat
[1:35:11] do you follow me
[1:35:12] do you follow me the power of the other
[1:35:15] court is not strong enough to hold the
[1:35:18] snake
[1:35:21] do you follow me and the longer you stay
[1:35:24] here the tendency you have to brought
[1:35:27] back to the world again
[1:35:29] because there is not much you can
[1:35:31] accomplish here
[1:35:33] the level here is two
[1:35:38] the master gave you two
[1:35:40] once you reach to that side
[1:35:47] everybody okay everybody okay it will
[1:35:50] not take you to three no because this
[1:35:52] level goes up to two
[1:36:02] oh my god
[1:36:03] brother branham says
[1:36:06] in this place we have the present altar
[1:36:09] what do we have here
[1:36:11] we have what the show bread
[1:36:13] the table of the show bread
[1:36:16] everybody okay
[1:36:17] then we have the candlestick
[1:36:20] and then we have water
[1:36:23] the altar of ensign so the golden altar
[1:36:26] everybody okay
[1:36:27] what do we have in the holiest
[1:36:30] the ark of the covenant
[1:36:32] and water
[1:36:34] and the water
[1:36:36] and the mercy seat
[1:36:38] on top of the ark everybody here and
[1:36:41] inside the ark you got three things
[1:36:43] there you got the mana you got the road
[1:36:46] of aaron and you got what else
[1:36:49] the water
[1:36:51] the what the table of stone everybody
[1:36:54] okay so far
[1:36:55] now
[1:36:56] ah this is all you have in the
[1:36:58] tabernacle
[1:37:00] everybody here now the problem we found
[1:37:03] that in the old testament moses
[1:37:08] took this
[1:37:10] ultra offenses
[1:37:11] and put it in the holy place
[1:37:14] you remember that
[1:37:16] when paul came
[1:37:18] paul
[1:37:19] took this altar here and put it in the
[1:37:22] holiest place
[1:37:25] everybody okay
[1:37:26] so this altar
[1:37:28] is the furniture that is moving between
[1:37:31] the holiest place
[1:37:33] and the holiest anybody care
[1:37:36] and the movement of this furniture
[1:37:39] is the cause of the saltis
[1:37:47] let me go slowly
[1:37:50] i believe last week what happened to our
[1:37:52] time
[1:37:54] why do we change the time
[1:37:58] so the time goes one hour
[1:38:00] and the time goes one hour back
[1:38:02] it's the saltis that is causing that
[1:38:05] everybody
[1:38:06] because of the movement of this altar
[1:38:09] back and forth
[1:38:11] this altar is responsible for the work
[1:38:14] of grace to be sometime through it
[1:38:18] sometimes fall
[1:38:22] sometimes you are justified
[1:38:26] you are sanctified
[1:38:28] and you are filled with the holy spirit
[1:38:31] and sometimes justification
[1:38:34] make way to sanctification
[1:38:36] sanctification make way to the baptism
[1:38:39] of the holy ghost and the baptism of the
[1:38:41] holy ghost make way to the holy ghost
[1:38:43] himself
[1:38:47] the movement of disorder can add or take
[1:38:51] away
[1:38:52] depending on how you're working with him
[1:38:54] if you working with individual people
[1:38:58] it is three
[1:39:00] if you work with the church ages
[1:39:03] he gives you four anybody get that
[1:39:07] if you didn't you let me know so i
[1:39:08] repeat it again
[1:39:10] do you want me to repeat again
[1:39:12] praise be the name of the lord this
[1:39:14] altar according to moses moses put this
[1:39:17] altar in the holy place
[1:39:20] when paul came in the new testament we
[1:39:23] showed to you paul took the shelter and
[1:39:25] put it in the holiest place it looks
[1:39:27] like this altar is moving between the
[1:39:30] two places and the movement of this
[1:39:32] altar is bringing one hour before or one
[1:39:36] hour behind
[1:39:39] anybody care but the time is still the
[1:39:41] same
[1:39:42] everybody okay
[1:39:44] everybody okay so sometimes this alter
[1:39:47] because if you notice the the strength
[1:39:50] of the pentecostal church is prayer
[1:39:56] here pentecostal pray and fast more than
[1:40:00] message believer
[1:40:02] they are professional and phd in prayer
[1:40:06] they can pray and fast 10 days
[1:40:08] they can pray and fast 20 days some pray
[1:40:11] and fast 30 days
[1:40:13] but we in the message we understand that
[1:40:16] the fasting must be instructed by god
[1:40:19] but to them is fast and pray fast and
[1:40:22] pray fast and pray fast and pray they're
[1:40:25] using the breast and altar back and
[1:40:28] forth
[1:40:33] relax you're gonna get to that brother
[1:40:36] bronham says this that on the inside of
[1:40:38] this court here called the holiest
[1:40:41] there was a piece of furniture sitting
[1:40:44] there called the water
[1:40:46] you can see it right there ever here and
[1:40:48] the covenant was in the water
[1:40:51] he's talking about the holiest place and
[1:40:53] the earth had two caribbeans
[1:40:55] the holiest and he was on the east side
[1:40:58] that was the furniture inside the holy
[1:41:00] place next come out was the water the
[1:41:04] golden candlestick brother brandon begin
[1:41:06] to speak about what
[1:41:08] the holy place
[1:41:09] karma and then on out to the water
[1:41:13] delivered the level brother branham is
[1:41:14] speaking about water
[1:41:17] now it perfectly represents
[1:41:21] the age of water
[1:41:23] and then
[1:41:25] and then
[1:41:26] exactly the three step of this
[1:41:28] procession of grace that has been given
[1:41:31] to mankind
[1:41:32] we are in the last dispensation i
[1:41:35] believe that we found my
[1:41:38] now brother branham is saying that this
[1:41:41] is luther
[1:41:44] this is wesley
[1:41:46] this is pentecost
[1:41:50] er back here
[1:41:52] hallelujah
[1:41:53] you'll be all right buddy
[1:41:56] brother branham says this
[1:41:58] the other court was who
[1:42:05] luther's age as we start in the body of
[1:42:08] the gentile church you see he's going to
[1:42:10] the church ages you remember they were
[1:42:13] jewish on up till about the time of
[1:42:15] eddie 606
[1:42:18] when it comes into tatarian because the
[1:42:20] church started at jerusalem it was
[1:42:22] nearly all jewish convert but after the
[1:42:26] jewish is dropped over in here at both
[1:42:29] jews and water
[1:42:30] mostly jews
[1:42:32] but when he really come into the gentile
[1:42:35] age come this side come martin luther
[1:42:38] john wesley and so forth
[1:42:40] brother problem is saying that when you
[1:42:42] go to the seven church ages you have one
[1:42:46] two three four five six seven brother
[1:42:49] branham said when he started at
[1:42:51] jerusalem here with paul anybody here
[1:42:54] all the way to the fourth church ages
[1:42:56] which is the italian church ages the
[1:42:59] majority of the people were jews
[1:43:03] even though there was some mixture but
[1:43:05] brother branham say after the dark ages
[1:43:08] hey here the church turned almost
[1:43:11] completely purely to gentile people
[1:43:15] anybody here and now brother branham
[1:43:17] said this is where the grace started
[1:43:21] because the seed that started on
[1:43:23] pentecost
[1:43:25] died
[1:43:26] until he went to the darkhead jesse and
[1:43:29] everything was completely lost and the
[1:43:32] catholic church took over everything
[1:43:35] now after the tartarian church ages god
[1:43:38] begin to start with luther
[1:43:41] then he starts with wesley then he
[1:43:43] starts with pentecost
[1:43:47] justification
[1:43:49] sanctification
[1:43:51] and baptism of the holy spirit
[1:43:54] but the bride age
[1:43:57] can change this
[1:43:59] from the baptism of the holy ghost to
[1:44:01] the holy ghost himself
[1:44:06] did i lose somebody
[1:44:10] brother branham said now he said now
[1:44:13] watch this last three after the dark
[1:44:16] ages number four
[1:44:18] come up to the middle age and pass over
[1:44:21] when he comes watch this other quote
[1:44:23] flesh
[1:44:24] so
[1:44:25] spirit at the court
[1:44:28] holiest and holy place and the other
[1:44:31] coat was the water
[1:44:33] everybody okay so far
[1:44:35] the holy place was water
[1:44:38] pilgrimage holiness and free water
[1:44:41] wesley and the holiest of holy back into
[1:44:44] the water
[1:44:46] to where it begin at the beginning
[1:44:48] back at the beginning so when we got
[1:44:50] back to our tabernacle now
[1:44:54] roof at luther we found that roof was
[1:44:58] already under justification
[1:45:00] sanctification is the holy place and
[1:45:02] then the baptism is the holiest now
[1:45:05] according to brother pranam brother
[1:45:07] brother moved from the individual work
[1:45:11] anybody clear
[1:45:13] to a church age edge
[1:45:16] now the other court is luther
[1:45:21] the holy place is wesley
[1:45:24] and the holiest is pentecost
[1:45:28] anybody okay but our subject this
[1:45:30] morning is ruth
[1:45:32] at luther
[1:45:34] ruth and the justification roof deciding
[1:45:40] amen you ready
[1:45:45] right here we have two people here
[1:45:48] both of them are reformers
[1:45:53] i'm making this sink
[1:45:55] anybody here
[1:45:57] on the left side it's martin luther
[1:46:00] on the right side is john wesley
[1:46:04] brother branham says this
[1:46:06] he said i wish
[1:46:07] it could be said
[1:46:09] that the sardison which is the church
[1:46:12] age of luther
[1:46:13] edge was a restoration instead of a
[1:46:17] reformation
[1:46:19] we have two words here
[1:46:21] one word is restoration
[1:46:26] you need to stay up
[1:46:28] the other word is reformation
[1:46:34] brother branham says this
[1:46:36] he says i cannot say that
[1:46:39] in other words i cannot call lutheran
[1:46:42] age restoration
[1:46:45] before we move forward
[1:46:48] restorations
[1:46:51] means to take something everybody
[1:46:55] and bring that back
[1:46:58] to its original position
[1:47:01] everybody here
[1:47:02] if you start
[1:47:04] the church ages with
[1:47:07] everybody
[1:47:09] if you want to restore the church age
[1:47:11] you must take the church and restore it
[1:47:14] exactly like he was when paul started on
[1:47:18] the day of pentecost
[1:47:19] if the church doesn't reach the day of
[1:47:22] pentecost you don't have a restoration
[1:47:26] everybody here
[1:47:27] restoration means if you are in level
[1:47:31] eight
[1:47:32] and you drop to level one
[1:47:34] if you are restored
[1:47:36] it means that somebody pick you from one
[1:47:39] and send you back again like you were in
[1:47:42] level eight
[1:47:44] everybody okay so far
[1:47:46] but reformation
[1:47:48] is only a an improvement
[1:47:54] reformation brings changes
[1:47:59] but it doesn't bring something back to
[1:48:02] where he came from
[1:48:06] let me go
[1:48:07] had it
[1:48:08] been a restoration that edge would have
[1:48:11] been another water
[1:48:13] so brother branham is saying if luther
[1:48:15] was a restoration so lutheran age should
[1:48:19] be exactly like the day of pentecost but
[1:48:21] when we check the edge of luther we see
[1:48:24] them with a lot of stuff they're smoking
[1:48:27] and they're going to church they are
[1:48:29] drinking whiskey they're drinking beer
[1:48:31] they going to church pentecosta people
[1:48:34] didn't do this so that was not a
[1:48:36] restoration it was only a reformation
[1:48:39] it's a small change that happened but
[1:48:42] the snake is still there
[1:48:47] anybody here
[1:48:49] but he was not the best that i could say
[1:48:52] of it was
[1:48:54] that could be said of it of that age was
[1:48:56] strengthened that which remained that is
[1:48:58] ready to die there was something missing
[1:49:02] ma yes there certainly was this age had
[1:49:06] justification
[1:49:07] but he had miss sanctification
[1:49:10] and the baptism of the holy spirit holy
[1:49:12] ghost that is what god's original plan
[1:49:15] was that is what they had at pentecost
[1:49:19] because we found out paul
[1:49:21] we gave you five examples in the book of
[1:49:24] acts all of them justify sanctify filled
[1:49:27] with the holy spirit all of them offered
[1:49:30] everybody here but when we come to
[1:49:32] luther as soon as somebody gives their
[1:49:35] life to god that's it
[1:49:38] they don't go any more further
[1:49:40] they are plateau
[1:49:42] what is going on
[1:49:43] everybody here
[1:49:44] he said they were justified they were
[1:49:47] sanctified and were filled with the holy
[1:49:50] spirit that's the original plan why
[1:49:52] listen to me the reason for being
[1:49:54] justified and sanctified is to the end
[1:49:58] that you might be baptized with water
[1:50:00] god cannot justify you for nothing
[1:50:05] when god is justifying you
[1:50:08] no automatically that your next step is
[1:50:11] going to be sanctification
[1:50:12] once you get sanctified your next step
[1:50:15] is going to be the baptism of the holy
[1:50:17] spirit
[1:50:19] [Music]
[1:50:21] oh my god
[1:50:23] now be careful and get this
[1:50:26] he says in this second verse that i read
[1:50:29] for i have not found that word perfect
[1:50:32] before god how can god look at the edge
[1:50:34] of luther and say your work are not
[1:50:36] perfect
[1:50:37] anybody clear do you know what the
[1:50:39] meaning of not perfect really is
[1:50:42] it is unfulfilled
[1:50:45] so when you get in the other court
[1:50:48] your journey is unfulfilled
[1:50:54] you have not reached the destination yet
[1:50:58] you need to keep moving
[1:51:00] it's a process
[1:51:01] this age was an unfulfilled age
[1:51:04] it was just the start
[1:51:07] remember the president
[1:51:09] of getting what
[1:51:11] so when you're in other courts
[1:51:14] it's just the beginning
[1:51:16] you need to move forward
[1:51:18] that is why i said the bible called
[1:51:20] reformation
[1:51:22] not restoration he had started out in
[1:51:25] the doctrine of water
[1:51:28] which meant salvation was all of water
[1:51:33] justification
[1:51:35] means salvation belong to god
[1:51:39] remember that
[1:51:40] salvation belongs to god
[1:51:43] and brother branham says
[1:51:47] that hal lute preached the water
[1:51:51] and the justification luther preached
[1:51:54] the sovereignty of god
[1:51:57] america
[1:51:59] and then he preached what
[1:52:02] election
[1:52:04] anybody care
[1:52:05] he knew he was all of what
[1:52:08] they have a phd in grace
[1:52:19] i'm going with you somewhere
[1:52:21] everybody here
[1:52:22] anybody care
[1:52:23] everybody clear
[1:52:25] the lutheran age did not restore the
[1:52:28] church he started a reformation
[1:52:34] the wesleyan age did not restore
[1:52:38] the pentecostal age did not restore
[1:52:46] everybody here
[1:52:47] ever here the lutheran churches just
[1:52:51] didn't restore
[1:52:53] the westlake churches didn't restore
[1:52:57] the pentecostal church ages didn't
[1:53:01] restore because according to the ages
[1:53:04] mr holy ghost is ready
[1:53:08] the restoration the pentecostal brought
[1:53:12] was the restoration of the gift of the
[1:53:16] holy ghost but not the holy ghost
[1:53:19] himself
[1:53:19] [Applause]
[1:53:24] this is why brother branham got in
[1:53:26] confusion
[1:53:28] he looked at two people
[1:53:30] one speaking in tongue one interpreting
[1:53:33] and he look at one a genuine believer
[1:53:36] another one sleeping with somebody
[1:53:38] else's wife
[1:53:42] how can a restoration give you the
[1:53:45] baptism of the holy spirit and tell you
[1:53:48] to enjoy somebody else twice
[1:53:52] and you go on the pentecostal people
[1:53:55] pastors are sleeping with women in the
[1:53:57] church pastor has sinned with
[1:53:59] prostituted people and you call that
[1:54:01] restoration
[1:54:03] and they can come back on the pulpit and
[1:54:04] begin to speak in tongues
[1:54:08] and he was in the hotel at night it was
[1:54:10] a restoration of the gift but it was not
[1:54:13] a restoration of the person
[1:54:16] any question so far
[1:54:18] [Applause]
[1:54:22] everybody care
[1:54:24] but
[1:54:25] god
[1:54:26] has to restore for he cannot deny his
[1:54:29] word in other words somehow there must
[1:54:32] be a restoration
[1:54:33] this is not the resurrection of the
[1:54:35] church it is the restoration god will
[1:54:38] take the church right back to pentecost
[1:54:41] of the beginning that's why elijah must
[1:54:44] come
[1:54:45] to restore the faith
[1:54:48] back to the faith of the original father
[1:54:53] why because luther fell
[1:54:56] west referred pentecost pentecostal took
[1:54:59] the heaven
[1:55:01] until they found out that with the
[1:55:03] experience the gift
[1:55:04] they cannot hold on to laodicea now this
[1:55:07] is pulling one preacher down after the
[1:55:09] other
[1:55:13] everybody okay
[1:55:14] brother branham said then come the water
[1:55:19] down through the edges come the face of
[1:55:21] a man
[1:55:22] the reformer had been seized who
[1:55:26] no restoration karma and water
[1:55:29] no restoration karma and then water
[1:55:32] no restoration on down to water
[1:55:35] now brother branham is paid he's putting
[1:55:37] pentecostal underwater
[1:55:40] reformers because
[1:55:42] because of the movement of the present
[1:55:45] altar
[1:55:48] amen
[1:55:50] everybody here the president is in the
[1:55:53] holy place
[1:55:55] we are the one that put the president
[1:55:58] into the holiest
[1:56:03] everybody okay so far
[1:56:05] brother stephen where are you going what
[1:56:07] is the problem luther has got to be
[1:56:10] molded into wesley
[1:56:15] in other words when god started with
[1:56:17] luther
[1:56:18] luther was not supposed to stay right
[1:56:22] here
[1:56:23] because when you stay right here you
[1:56:26] only have two level
[1:56:27] once you plateau you are now going back
[1:56:30] to death
[1:56:33] everybody okay
[1:56:34] luther was supposed to be in more faith
[1:56:39] in other words change into wesley
[1:56:48] luther has got to be molded into wesley
[1:56:52] and wesley had got to be molded into
[1:56:55] water
[1:56:57] the ages and pentecost
[1:57:00] has to be molded into what
[1:57:06] luther
[1:57:07] into wesley wesley into pentecost so the
[1:57:11] pentecostal have to move to the very
[1:57:13] person of christ
[1:57:15] they miss that
[1:57:17] that's why pentecostal are in the
[1:57:18] trouble they are today
[1:57:20] they cannot
[1:57:22] they cannot preach that women need to
[1:57:24] get their paint off they're going to
[1:57:25] lose their thought in church because all
[1:57:27] the women will run away they cannot
[1:57:29] preach against her against hearing the
[1:57:32] women will be out they cannot preach
[1:57:34] against makeup the women will be out
[1:57:36] until now the women are taking over the
[1:57:38] pentecostal world and the women become
[1:57:41] pastors and preachers
[1:57:42] if they go against it they're gonna lose
[1:57:45] the popularity because pentecost was not
[1:57:48] restoration
[1:57:52] anybody here
[1:57:53] so you need to stay away from
[1:57:56] pentecostal preachers
[1:57:58] any preacher of pentecost cannot help
[1:58:01] you
[1:58:03] you are wasting your time
[1:58:06] [Applause]
[1:58:10] but here if you have your favorite
[1:58:12] pentecostal preacher from today get away
[1:58:15] from that
[1:58:16] the power they have is not strong enough
[1:58:21] to withstand our nation
[1:58:24] [Applause]
[1:58:29] you need something that can restore you
[1:58:31] back to god
[1:58:33] until you walk in the midst of the
[1:58:35] valley of shadow of darkness you don't
[1:58:38] feel no evil because somebody is with me
[1:58:41] [Applause]
[1:58:46] hallelujah
[1:58:50] he goes through a water
[1:58:52] so has the gospel gone through uh
[1:58:56] it's processing
[1:58:58] lutheran age
[1:59:00] justification we believe that wesley
[1:59:04] sanctification we believe that
[1:59:07] the pentecostal restoration of the gift
[1:59:10] for the holy ghost we believe that
[1:59:12] certainly but mold it all together
[1:59:17] anybody here
[1:59:18] don't measure in the other court
[1:59:24] don't make joy in the holy place
[1:59:26] you got to put it all together
[1:59:32] hallelujah
[1:59:33] what do you come out with jesus
[1:59:37] the same
[1:59:39] today and what
[1:59:41] oh i'll come out with who
[1:59:46] everybody cares so far
[1:59:48] blessed be the name of the lord
[1:59:51] justification service time
[1:59:55] in justification under looter then he
[1:59:58] had to become
[2:00:01] amorphy through wesley and
[2:00:03] sanctification serve its time
[2:00:11] justification
[2:00:13] have a message from god
[2:00:17] anybody okay
[2:00:18] and that message have talent
[2:00:24] anybody okay
[2:00:25] once he serves its time
[2:00:28] the talent is reached
[2:00:31] you have to move with the second talent
[2:00:41] sanctification serves time till he
[2:00:44] becomes the baptism of the holy ghost
[2:00:47] and the baptism of the holy ghost serve
[2:00:49] its time until the word
[2:00:52] which there is not only one god blend
[2:00:55] into the church and the church into who
[2:00:59] and he makes jesus reflected on the
[2:01:02] earth

[2:01:24] your word to that age
[2:01:27] you allotted them a talent
[2:01:30] everybody here
[2:01:32] somehow we don't know how it ever
[2:01:34] happened but in each of those ages as we
[2:01:38] look back upon the word and we see that
[2:01:41] there was an anointing come in that age
[2:01:44] to fulfill that word
[2:01:47] there we go
[2:01:49] and in the days that we are living in
[2:01:52] there is an allotted word

[2:02:03] and that talent have a portion
[2:02:08] everybody okay
[2:02:09] [Laughter]
[2:02:12] we believe that the holy spirit is here
[2:02:15] on earth
[2:02:16] trying to find a heart
[2:02:18] to manifest and to bring it to pass by
[2:02:21] vindicating the word that is now
[2:02:24] prophesy for water
[2:02:26] and water
[2:02:33] god promised to noah won't work for us
[2:02:37] today

[2:03:07] god allotted his way to each water
[2:03:10] it's another talent
[2:03:14] it's another level
[2:03:16] it's another measurement
[2:03:19] [Music]
[2:03:21] proportional to the time you are living

[2:10:41] to handle the level of an adult you need
[2:10:44] to increase the dosage
[2:10:48] the drug is still amoxicillin
[2:10:52] but the dosage is different according to
[2:10:56] the height and the weight of the
[2:10:58] individual
[2:11:01] you gotta know the height of this edge
[2:11:04] and the weight of this cell to give the
[2:11:07] proper dosage
[2:11:12] [Applause]

[2:14:04] oh that's a preacher who doesn't want to
[2:14:06] hurt the feeling of the people
[2:14:09] we want to compromise
[2:14:11] to keep the believer in the church

[2:15:11] this
[2:15:16] hallelujah
[2:15:18] hallelujah
[2:15:19] he said he won't grow
[2:15:22] in any condition it must be the
[2:15:25] condition that grows it
[2:15:30] when you come in this world you have a
[2:15:32] program
[2:15:34] nobody can decode that
[2:15:37] only a certain message
[2:15:39] that's why you were in the baptist
[2:15:40] church and you were not happy
[2:15:42] that's why you were under pentecostal
[2:15:44] and you were not happy but one day when
[2:15:47] somebody began to talk about them and
[2:15:48] said
[2:15:49] something just struck like
[2:15:52] this is true
[2:15:54] this is true
[2:15:56] that is the message
[2:15:58] that can decode you
[2:16:05] hallelujah
[2:16:07] you just read the message like this and
[2:16:09] somebody's in you is saying that's
[2:16:11] correct
[2:16:12] that's correct that's correct it is the
[2:16:15] predestinated seed
[2:16:17] that is telling you this is for me this
[2:16:20] is for me this is for me this is for me
[2:16:26] [Applause]
[2:16:29] hallelujah
[2:16:33] my god
[2:16:35] but you take the sun
[2:16:39] you take the sun that shine in august
[2:16:43] and put it on the wheat today it will do
[2:16:45] what
[2:16:50] because it's too strong
[2:16:52] that's why you have a hard time
[2:16:54] taking this message and pushing to the
[2:16:57] denomination
[2:16:58] they can't get it it's going to kill
[2:17:00] them
[2:17:01] because when the message entered there
[2:17:03] you begin to knock the women preacher
[2:17:05] you begin to knock the makeup nobody
[2:17:07] they can't handle that
[2:17:10] they are not have they
[2:17:12] they have done for one talent
[2:17:15] the son of five talent will kill this
[2:17:22] hallelujah
[2:17:24] certainly you can do that it must come
[2:17:26] in its season
[2:17:28] so must god wheat and grain wrapping
[2:17:31] just in
[2:17:33] the season in it
[2:17:35] it's in but
[2:17:37] well a wheat will die the fruit will die
[2:17:40] but the sun that lives today
[2:17:42] that's sham today rather it's oncoming
[2:17:44] harvest is happening it is rapping the
[2:17:47] grain should mature with the water
[2:17:50] in other words you cannot bring the
[2:17:52] message right here
[2:17:54] and then you bring it all the way to the
[2:17:56] tartarian because the crop in tatarian
[2:17:59] are still under
[2:18:01] in other words you cannot take a boy
[2:18:04] that is five years old and you give him
[2:18:07] 875 milligram amoxicillin
[2:18:10] you will see the boy sitting like this
[2:18:12] and suddenly he can move
[2:18:14] because the dosage is too much
[2:18:20] hallelujah

[2:21:00] respect for john wesley
[2:21:03] sankey
[2:21:05] moody

[2:21:12] minister who appreciate the men of god
[2:21:15] that would have those men
[2:21:17] we all appreciate them
[2:21:18] anybody care
[2:21:20] yeah they have one talent that one who
[2:21:22] has three that one have four
[2:21:24] but the dosage is different
[2:21:27] everybody here
[2:21:28] but see we are coming up
[2:21:32] we are not in that age
[2:21:34] each one of them
[2:21:36] serve
[2:21:37] everybody okay
[2:21:39] in a different age and in a different
[2:21:43] the talents are different
[2:21:46] everybody here the talents are different
[2:21:49] the talent of the holy the outer court
[2:21:52] is a different talent than the holy
[2:21:54] place and the talent of the holy place
[2:21:57] is lower than the talent of the holiest
[2:22:03] everybody here hey
[2:22:05] we are serving god today
[2:22:08] in the different measure from what they
[2:22:12] wear the dosage is different
[2:22:15] if there is a tomorrow
[2:22:18] there will be an edge
[2:22:20] there will be a gospel if
[2:22:24] not there is a tomorrow if
[2:22:27] anybody care
[2:22:28] that we still advance until the whole
[2:22:31] thing is what
[2:22:33] complete in god and god become
[2:22:37] you gotta go all the way until you and
[2:22:41] the maker you are won
[2:22:45] everybody here
[2:22:46] my god what are you saying
[2:22:49] i believe that martin luther had the
[2:22:52] holy spirit
[2:22:56] this is where people got trouble
[2:22:59] so brother stephen we need to go to the
[2:23:01] lutheran church
[2:23:05] hallelujah i believe that martin luther
[2:23:08] had the holy ghost
[2:23:10] absolutely
[2:23:11] maybe not
[2:23:14] [Music]
[2:23:16] in the water
[2:23:25] it was a holy ghost under one talent
[2:23:31] and that one talent can only work in
[2:23:34] luther's time
[2:23:38] when the infection increase from hell
[2:23:41] they have to increase the dosage with
[2:23:43] wesley
[2:23:46] and in now this your hell is now open
[2:23:49] so heaven must also give a different
[2:23:52] dosage
[2:23:58] that's why we cannot go on the little
[2:24:01] church
[2:24:04] hallelujah
[2:24:07] maybe
[2:24:08] not in the portion it is today because
[2:24:11] it was not
[2:24:13] that does it was not available yet
[2:24:20] brother branham is saying
[2:24:22] everybody care
[2:24:24] a person that come at the president
[2:24:27] can only fulfill what is here
[2:24:31] and when he fulfill what is here
[2:24:33] which is the word of his time
[2:24:36] he's good with god
[2:24:38] everybody
[2:24:39] but
[2:24:40] this the ark will not be give it was not
[2:24:43] given here
[2:24:45] it was not the time for the ark yet
[2:24:48] it was not available
[2:24:50] this is the portion that you have
[2:24:56] here
[2:24:57] but we have been through this you people
[2:25:00] of the tabernacle here on the blackboard
[2:25:02] but he did believe to god and he that
[2:25:05] believe has water
[2:25:06] that's how luther can preach the people
[2:25:10] that's all once he finished luther plato
[2:25:13] you can give luther the bible he doesn't
[2:25:16] see sanctification
[2:25:18] he can turn the pages like this he
[2:25:20] doesn't see sanctification
[2:25:23] because his level his talent is blocking
[2:25:26] him
[2:25:28] when wesley comes wesley pick up
[2:25:31] and he looks like once they say wait a
[2:25:33] minute
[2:25:33] this is sanctification
[2:25:35] come you lutheran
[2:25:37] this is sanctification oh we didn't see
[2:25:39] it it was all over he loved it was all
[2:25:41] around here
[2:25:45] but wesley could read the day of
[2:25:48] pentecost and speaking in tongues and
[2:25:51] prophesying first corinthians 13 first
[2:25:53] corinthians 14 and the gift of the
[2:25:55] spirit it doesn't mean anything to him
[2:25:57] because he has plato
[2:26:00] he already he can he cannot go further
[2:26:02] than what he does as he is
[2:26:05] amen
[2:26:06] then the pentecostal came in azusa
[2:26:08] street
[2:26:09] and they begin to speak in tongues
[2:26:11] and they say look it's right here
[2:26:14] but after a while the pentecostal
[2:26:16] flipped the bible all they know speaking
[2:26:18] in tongues have the holy ghost you have
[2:26:20] the holy ghost you're speaking to yeah
[2:26:21] and then finally prosperity prosperity
[2:26:23] prosperity prosperity prosperity
[2:26:25] prosperity then an adam came
[2:26:28] and the bible now rip open
[2:26:34] here
[2:26:35] there is the church
[2:26:37] god picks them up through lutheran age
[2:26:39] justification wesley age he sanctified
[2:26:42] them and in this day the eg filled them
[2:26:46] he put the life in them everybody here
[2:26:49] the holy spirit picked them up the holy
[2:26:51] spirit sanctified them the holy spirit
[2:26:54] filled them see it's all the same church
[2:26:57] i think that
[2:26:59] luther kama and what westlake kama and
[2:27:03] what
[2:27:04] all of them many of them will go in the
[2:27:07] water
[2:27:08] according to their dosage
[2:27:11] not the lutheran today
[2:27:16] [Music]
[2:27:18] everybody okay
[2:27:19] they had the water
[2:27:22] after
[2:27:23] all of them got money
[2:27:27] they got faith
[2:27:28] but in person
[2:27:35] and the faith that you have will
[2:27:38] reproduce the believer to the height
[2:27:41] or the capacity of that portion
[2:27:45] if the portion is one the believer will
[2:27:47] be one and reach down and plateau
[2:27:52] everybody here
[2:27:53] they had the portion of the spirit was
[2:27:56] preached to them they believed it
[2:27:58] just like job all he knew was the
[2:28:01] sacrifice of the lamb what else do you
[2:28:03] expect from job
[2:28:05] nothing else everybody
[2:28:07] brother branham said luther under
[2:28:09] justification that is what he preached
[2:28:12] is that right luther preached the
[2:28:14] justice by faith and he had a great
[2:28:17] message and that was a
[2:28:20] of the holy ghost
[2:28:22] that lutheran went
[2:28:25] when the message comes off god was going
[2:28:27] to raise up his church and send it out
[2:28:29] great luther say oh we believe we
[2:28:32] gathered here
[2:28:33] now we got the restoration before you
[2:28:35] know it all the believers go
[2:28:38] after a while give me my whiskey and
[2:28:40] luther don't understand why are these
[2:28:42] people drinking whiskey
[2:28:47] but here
[2:28:48] we are at the end time that is what the
[2:28:51] holy ghost does the holy ghost by what
[2:28:55] just a light shadow of it
[2:28:58] a talent
[2:28:59] the holy ghost by water
[2:29:02] a little deeper shadow of it the talent
[2:29:04] increase the the the dosage is
[2:29:06] increasing the holy ghost by water
[2:29:10] a deeper shadow of it the dosage
[2:29:12] increase now the holy ghost by water
[2:29:15] of the water
[2:29:17] now we have the full
[2:29:19] dosage
[2:29:22] you give luther our daughter you kill
[2:29:24] him
[2:29:29] hallelujah
[2:29:31] that is what that is the way god is
[2:29:34] bringing his church we are fitly joined
[2:29:37] together one heart and one accord now
[2:29:40] somebody said well the lutheran back
[2:29:42] there they had nothing
[2:29:44] don't you believe it
[2:29:46] the lutheran will come forth in the
[2:29:48] resurrection the lutheran back there
[2:29:52] just the same as the rest will come
[2:29:54] forth in the resurrection in other words
[2:29:56] these lutheran are already dead
[2:29:59] [Music]
[2:30:01] not the lutheran today anybody care and
[2:30:04] that's the reason today people say oh
[2:30:06] well there shall be a sweeping revolver
[2:30:09] that shall go out here and save the
[2:30:10] hundred million pentecost they shall all
[2:30:13] get saved and they shall be interrupted
[2:30:15] you are mistaken
[2:30:18] the rapture will be hundreds of
[2:30:20] thousands that's right but they shall be
[2:30:23] made up of 6 000 years of water
[2:30:26] in other words the biggest number of the
[2:30:29] bread it doesn't come from the
[2:30:31] pentecostal it starts from paul all the
[2:30:34] way that's what makes the bread bigger
[2:30:36] so don't expect a bigger number
[2:30:39] hallelujah man walks in the light
[2:30:43] as the light
[2:30:45] comes to him he crosses the bridges when
[2:30:47] he comes to them and if he refuse it
[2:30:51] then he's left in water
[2:30:53] but if he keeps moving on
[2:30:55] [Music]
[2:30:56] so what are diluted today
[2:30:59] what are they doing today
[2:31:01] the whole rapture now luther was a part
[2:31:04] wesley was a part the prophet was apart
[2:31:08] a part just in the revelation that they
[2:31:11] was making up
[2:31:13] according to their talent the body the
[2:31:15] feet the toes the arm and so forth until
[2:31:18] their
[2:31:19] the constellation
[2:31:21] everybody here which we get to that in
[2:31:23] the few minutes that makes the entire
[2:31:25] rapture
[2:31:26] that don't mean that luther is lost
[2:31:30] the lutheran that rejects sanctification
[2:31:34] would be lost
[2:31:37] why because another door unfolded
[2:31:42] that message now cannot hold on because
[2:31:45] hell has turned up
[2:31:47] everybody here you need to move to the
[2:31:49] second shield
[2:31:50] everybody here
[2:31:52] that wants to hold on to something
[2:31:54] israel eat new man away
[2:31:58] you cannot keep it the next day the only
[2:32:00] manner that could stay without being
[2:32:02] changed it's the manner
[2:32:06] that's an eternal manner
[2:32:10] everybody here
[2:32:12] but you got a manner from luther he can
[2:32:14] last or not
[2:32:16] that is why luton lost his message
[2:32:20] that is how wesley lost his message if
[2:32:23] the west land church would have went on
[2:32:26] there will be what
[2:32:28] and if the lutheran went on they will
[2:32:30] become what
[2:32:32] and now if the pentecost are gone they
[2:32:34] shall be what
[2:32:41] in other words the requirement today
[2:32:44] is more than the other code
[2:32:48] so if you are a believer today
[2:32:51] once you got to the present altar and in
[2:32:54] the level you have not finished yet
[2:32:57] you have not met god qualification for
[2:33:00] this time
[2:33:01] if you are living under looter fine
[2:33:04] there is nothing else you can do
[2:33:06] but here in this age you must go to the
[2:33:09] next one and when you finish the next
[2:33:12] one you must go to the other one and
[2:33:14] tell the holy ghost getting you because
[2:33:16] those eggs for the holy ghost is given
[2:33:19] now
[2:33:21] so you cannot meet god today
[2:33:24] do you follow me
[2:33:26] with justification
[2:33:28] that's why brother branham say only the
[2:33:30] people that have the holy ghost will go
[2:33:33] in the rapture because that's the
[2:33:35] requirement today
[2:33:40] so you cannot stay under justification
[2:33:43] you're going to stay
[2:33:48] hallelujah
[2:33:50] brother branham say if you hang back
[2:33:54] and keep going back in the world like
[2:33:56] you are going now you will be what
[2:34:02] 20 years in the message
[2:34:04] in the other court you're going to get
[2:34:06] lost
[2:34:07] because the dosage today the requirement
[2:34:09] is over there
[2:34:11] we are not undiluted
[2:34:13] the plateau today is higher everybody
[2:34:15] here
[2:34:17] if
[2:34:18] it shall only be the shack and the stock
[2:34:21] is to be watered
[2:34:22] you're going to be put together with the
[2:34:25] lutheran that is today and you are going
[2:34:27] to go through the tribulation period
[2:34:29] ever here the only way you can escape
[2:34:32] and be shield from god you got to get in
[2:34:34] the holiest
[2:34:36] and now the devil can get to you because
[2:34:38] the devil today can speak in tongues
[2:34:41] he can prophesy and he live like a devil
[2:34:45] he can cheat he can lie he can come to
[2:34:48] church and live any kind of way
[2:34:50] that anointing cannot work today
[2:34:53] you need something stronger and that
[2:34:56] which is stronger contain everything
[2:34:59] he contained justification he contained
[2:35:02] what a baptism he contained
[2:35:05] sanctification he also speak in tongues
[2:35:12] it is the giver
[2:35:14] not the gift
[2:35:15] the giver have everything
[2:35:20] hallelujah
[2:35:22] so what happened after these
[2:35:25] and wesley came up and bring their
[2:35:28] biggest message
[2:35:30] everybody
[2:35:31] buff lutheran wesley i'm going to go to
[2:35:33] the airport
[2:35:35] both children
[2:35:38] everybody okay that's why you heard
[2:35:41] brother branham say knox phoenix sankey
[2:35:43] all of those are children but among
[2:35:46] those children
[2:35:47] there were two of them that excel
[2:35:49] everybody
[2:35:53] those two children are these two
[2:35:56] everybody okay
[2:35:58] on the left side it's heaven
[2:36:03] on the right side is armenians
[2:36:05] relax
[2:36:07] everybody here
[2:36:09] brady branham
[2:36:11] god raised up many muddy men of which
[2:36:14] luther was but
[2:36:17] calvin
[2:36:18] and zwingli
[2:36:19] were two other luminous and beside these
[2:36:22] were many many more who are not so well
[2:36:25] known however though all this was not in
[2:36:29] vain the mighty work of god was actually
[2:36:32] what
[2:36:33] injured by these very men so the
[2:36:36] messenger the people that were bringing
[2:36:39] the messenger calls a stumbling block to
[2:36:41] the believer
[2:36:45] because it was not the time yet
[2:36:48] in the age of philadelphia which is the
[2:36:50] age of wesley brother bonham said even
[2:36:52] though luther brought the truth just the
[2:36:55] truth of justification the romans church
[2:36:58] and the eastern counterpart the orthodox
[2:37:01] stage still clung to works
[2:37:03] now works are fine but they don't save
[2:37:06] you they don't make you perfect it's
[2:37:08] crust or perish it is not even crushed
[2:37:11] and works it is crust alone
[2:37:13] this edge begins the year of what
[2:37:16] armenianism that does not believe in
[2:37:19] christ as day
[2:37:21] he does not sing
[2:37:23] nothing but the blood for he's seeing
[2:37:25] nothing but the blood and my own
[2:37:28] i'm gonna get there
[2:37:30] let's go slowly
[2:37:33] so these four now
[2:37:35] causes the lutheran church
[2:37:38] the west land church
[2:37:40] the cavinism
[2:37:42] and the armenianism
[2:37:46] what is going on when brother branham
[2:37:48] came
[2:37:50] brother branham put the macroscope on
[2:37:52] all of them
[2:37:55] everybody okay
[2:37:57] and brother branham found out
[2:37:59] that all of them can be divided into
[2:38:04] it's only two groups
[2:38:06] hey berkeley
[2:38:08] and these two group now it seems like
[2:38:11] luther was going down and calvin was
[2:38:14] taking more power than luther until
[2:38:17] today
[2:38:20] it looks like wesleyan church begin to
[2:38:22] go down they met this and then the
[2:38:25] armenians begin to get more power
[2:38:28] and dominated the world
[2:38:30] and these two guys here
[2:38:33] dominated the edges
[2:38:36] until
[2:38:37] they impact even the marriages
[2:38:40] [Music]
[2:38:46] you ready
[2:38:48] what is really is the problem pastor
[2:38:51] put your seatbelt
[2:38:52] as i'm going to zeroed in to the airport
[2:38:55] what is the problem between those what's
[2:38:57] really going on
[2:38:59] the problem
[2:39:00] is between paul
[2:39:05] the problem
[2:39:08] is between paul
[2:39:10] and james
[2:39:17] can i have another one brother kelly
[2:39:20] paul and james
[2:39:21] why to kill him i have another thank you
[2:39:24] the problem
[2:39:26] is between paul
[2:39:28] and james
[2:39:32] these two group
[2:39:34] what happened what are you preaching
[2:39:36] brother stephen paul when he came
[2:39:41] paul began to speak to the roman and the
[2:39:43] galatians
[2:39:45] and paul made some strong statement
[2:39:48] and paul says in romans 3 21
[2:39:51] therefore we conduct
[2:39:54] we conclude i'm sorry that a man is
[2:39:58] justified by what
[2:40:01] without water
[2:40:03] paul bring a separation
[2:40:06] between faith
[2:40:11] and
[2:40:12] the deed of the law
[2:40:16] or
[2:40:18] works
[2:40:20] this did
[2:40:21] you follow me
[2:40:23] is not your deed
[2:40:25] i want you to keep that in mind because
[2:40:26] sooner we're going to get ruth serving
[2:40:30] everybody okay
[2:40:31] this deed are not your deed
[2:40:34] it is the deed of the
[2:40:37] law
[2:40:38] it is things that god require you to do
[2:40:43] everybody
[2:40:44] not what men require you to do
[2:40:47] so these deeds are not the deed of man
[2:40:50] they are the deed from god
[2:40:52] this faith also is not the faith of man
[2:40:56] it is the faith from god but when paul
[2:40:58] came paul said you are justified by
[2:41:02] faith remember we are roof under loot
[2:41:05] roof under justification
[2:41:09] everybody here
[2:41:10] paul emphasized again
[2:41:13] in romans 4 he said for if abraham
[2:41:16] were justified by what
[2:41:19] he have wherefore to glory but not
[2:41:22] before god
[2:41:24] paul said if abraham was justified by
[2:41:27] work ah the people who praise him but
[2:41:30] not god
[2:41:31] so
[2:41:32] the calvinist and luther when they saw
[2:41:34] that they say see it is faith
[2:41:37] it is faith
[2:41:38] forget about the work
[2:41:41] i'm going slowly everybody okay now
[2:41:45] blessed be the name of the lord
[2:41:47] paul moved from roman four he insisted
[2:41:50] again in romans five he said therefore
[2:41:53] being justified by what
[2:41:56] justification
[2:41:57] by faith not by work we have peace with
[2:42:00] god through our lord jesus christ
[2:42:04] luther say remember you the catholic
[2:42:07] church always do this do this
[2:42:10] faith
[2:42:10] faith fifth
[2:42:12] calvin took it and became a phd on that
[2:42:19] galatian 2 16 paul say knowing that a
[2:42:23] man
[2:42:25] is not justified by water
[2:42:28] so that kills completely work
[2:42:30] luther and calvin say forget about this
[2:42:35] paul say not work all i have to
[2:42:38] do faith
[2:42:40] i'm ready to go to heaven
[2:42:43] and you hear them in the message
[2:42:45] touching jesus it's all that really
[2:42:48] matters and my life will not be the same
[2:42:54] everybody okay
[2:42:55] they can post that quickly
[2:42:58] especially if the pastor is preaching on
[2:43:00] sanctification
[2:43:02] lutheran don't like it
[2:43:05] hold on anybody here
[2:43:07] he said bad
[2:43:08] by faith of what
[2:43:11] that's all it's easy even we have
[2:43:14] believed in jesus christ that we might
[2:43:16] be justified by what
[2:43:18] of christ and not by the water
[2:43:21] wake of the lord forever work of the
[2:43:23] lord shall whatever
[2:43:25] no flesh be magnified that's it
[2:43:27] it's easy all the time tight traces
[2:43:30] short dresses too much i believe in
[2:43:32] jesus christ that's all
[2:43:35] lutheran
[2:43:36] [Music]
[2:43:37] under the message of globalism
[2:43:40] everybody here
[2:43:42] galatians 3 paul come back again
[2:43:45] he said but no man is justified by what
[2:43:51] in the sight of god it is evident that
[2:43:54] the justice league by what
[2:43:56] are luther embrace that
[2:43:58] he say i got it that's all
[2:44:01] faith
[2:44:03] so when the brother is in church
[2:44:05] hallelujah fifth when he goes home he
[2:44:08] opened his refrigerator whiskey
[2:44:11] it is faith
[2:44:16] lutheran in the message of brother
[2:44:17] branham
[2:44:19] on the other side james come
[2:44:23] james say
[2:44:24] but
[2:44:25] will dad know of venman
[2:44:28] that faith without water
[2:44:30] work is what
[2:44:34] john wesley come he say
[2:44:36] you've been playing too much in church
[2:44:39] your faith show me your work
[2:44:42] what do you mean come open james
[2:44:45] faith without
[2:44:47] instead look at your work
[2:44:49] you don't have it
[2:44:53] am i reading a different bible
[2:44:56] you want to go home
[2:44:58] so james come and he put one works
[2:45:03] and he said two faith
[2:45:07] now armenianism
[2:45:10] go this way
[2:45:11] and they push on faith on
[2:45:15] everybody here
[2:45:17] hallelujah
[2:45:18] was not abraham our father justified by
[2:45:21] what
[2:45:22] oh my god
[2:45:25] paul said he was justified by what
[2:45:29] you need a prophet
[2:45:31] that can take james and paul and put
[2:45:34] them together
[2:45:37] [Music]
[2:45:39] hallelujah
[2:45:41] when he had offered isaac he signed up
[2:45:44] to the altar
[2:45:45] go see what abraham did over there he
[2:45:48] didn't just watch that day and say i
[2:45:50] believe god i believe god no when god
[2:45:53] asked him something he took it and he
[2:45:55] did
[2:45:56] when god said take off your shot
[2:46:00] skirt he went and throw it in the ground
[2:46:10] everybody okay
[2:46:13] says that her faith
[2:46:16] wrote with his work
[2:46:18] and by work was made faith was made what
[2:46:22] now according to james what makes work
[2:46:24] faith perfect
[2:46:26] according to paul what is the main thing
[2:46:29] but nobody can be justified before god
[2:46:33] the puzzle
[2:46:34] because the talent is blinding them
[2:46:37] they're reaching their plateau
[2:46:40] you need a different dosage
[2:46:44] everybody here
[2:46:45] and the scripture was fulfilled which
[2:46:47] say abraham believed god oh the covenant
[2:46:51] is saying now we got you
[2:46:53] see he believes god
[2:46:55] armenians say slow down he say come on
[2:46:58] and he was imputed unto him for water
[2:47:02] calvin said you see i was telling you
[2:47:04] and he was called water
[2:47:06] calvin said slow down close the bible
[2:47:08] itself he was already the friend of god
[2:47:11] armenians say let me continue
[2:47:13] he said you see them how by water
[2:47:16] a man is water
[2:47:19] and not by what
[2:47:24] so armenian is saying you cannot stop at
[2:47:27] faith only you gotta add work
[2:47:31] because his dosage have increased
[2:47:34] it is not 250 milligram calvin you need
[2:47:38] to go to 500.
[2:47:42] hallelujah likewise also was not rehab
[2:47:46] the harlot justified by what
[2:47:48] when she had received the messenger and
[2:47:51] had seen them out another way you go to
[2:47:54] hebrew 11 paul said by faith rehab
[2:48:04] why you didn't reject the bible with all
[2:48:07] this
[2:48:08] so contradiction
[2:48:12] [Music]
[2:48:14] hallelujah
[2:48:16] for us the body without the spirit is
[2:48:19] water
[2:48:20] so faith without work is water
[2:48:26] those two emerge
[2:48:29] faith
[2:48:31] i follow luther
[2:48:32] i mean in this no
[2:48:34] i follow wesley works
[2:48:37] everybody okay
[2:48:38] with you marion branham
[2:48:40] does
[2:48:41] who has he has called he has already
[2:48:45] those who he justified he has already
[2:48:48] oh the calvinist starts shouting
[2:48:52] i'm already justified so i'm already
[2:48:55] glorified
[2:48:59] that's right
[2:49:00] there is where we get
[2:49:04] and works what
[2:49:06] here is the whole things in water
[2:49:10] armenian and what
[2:49:17] grace
[2:49:19] is what god does for you
[2:49:26] are we okay
[2:49:28] that's grace
[2:49:29] he paid the price he went on the cross
[2:49:32] for you he died for you by his trap you
[2:49:35] are here you don't have nothing to do
[2:49:38] the calvinists say amen
[2:49:44] what
[2:49:45] is what you do for who
[2:49:48] see it is grace that bring you to
[2:49:51] and what says that what you do for
[2:49:55] i'm gonna show you what kind of works
[2:49:57] his brother brought i'm talking about
[2:49:59] not today when we're gonna get to roof
[2:50:01] serving you will see how do you serve
[2:50:04] god not according to your work but what
[2:50:06] is work everybody okay
[2:50:09] because if you don't understand work
[2:50:11] you're going to be an armenian in the
[2:50:12] message
[2:50:15] everybody okay
[2:50:16] now as abraham was justified by faith
[2:50:20] because he believed in god paul
[2:50:22] justified him by what
[2:50:24] james turn over and justify him by what
[2:50:28] but paul was speaking of what god
[2:50:31] and james was speaking of what man
[2:50:34] you see how the prophet begin to get
[2:50:36] if you say you are a believer and then
[2:50:39] act contrary to what you say then you
[2:50:42] are not there
[2:50:48] everybody here oh my god it should be
[2:50:52] mentioned that wesley never did desire
[2:50:54] to build a work upon a denomination of
[2:50:57] sectarian basis though he was an
[2:51:00] armenian in his belief
[2:51:04] he was a good candidate for
[2:51:07] james he based his eternal life on faith
[2:51:11] and
[2:51:12] or living the life rather than simply
[2:51:22] let's head to the airport
[2:51:23] amen
[2:51:25] brother branham now is dealing with both
[2:51:26] of them he said calvinist just believe
[2:51:30] on the lord and you got eternal security
[2:51:33] armenianism that if you just touch not
[2:51:37] hand or not test not i like to do this
[2:51:39] but i can do it armenianism is too far
[2:51:42] away from calvinist and they both for
[2:51:45] what
[2:51:51] they were right in their time
[2:51:58] but today they are wrong
[2:52:01] because their dosage is not for today
[2:52:06] they both got scripture but it's got to
[2:52:09] hit the target
[2:52:11] he only reveal his word in the
[2:52:13] predestination now when i use the word
[2:52:15] predestination it's a bad word to use in
[2:52:18] public especially when we have a mixed
[2:52:21] crowd between
[2:52:22] the armenian and water
[2:52:26] i have asked you not to think i know it
[2:52:28] all but they are both wrong according to
[2:52:31] the scripture
[2:52:33] i will go slowly down the road and show
[2:52:35] you how to put both of them together
[2:52:37] according to brother branham amen
[2:52:40] in marriage and divorce
[2:52:43] brother branham said there is two great
[2:52:45] water
[2:52:46] of doctrine in there
[2:52:49] one of them is water
[2:52:50] and the other is water
[2:52:52] since those people dominated the
[2:52:55] denominational world
[2:52:57] two of them
[2:52:58] everybody here
[2:53:00] one is what
[2:53:03] and the other one is what
[2:53:12] you have it in the message
[2:53:16] i'm gonna learn
[2:53:17] and we come to find out that people who
[2:53:20] believe in grace they calvinist they say
[2:53:23] bless god you don't hurt me to smoke
[2:53:26] he don't hurt me to drink i can do these
[2:53:29] things i got eternal water
[2:53:31] then we found on the other side on the
[2:53:34] legalistic
[2:53:35] oh i would like to ball him out i would
[2:53:37] like to show him a piece of my mind but
[2:53:40] i am a christian i have to keep water
[2:53:43] both of them got snake
[2:53:52] this snake is more active
[2:53:56] than this one this is kind of dormant
[2:54:03] everybody okay
[2:54:04] we have to teach you this thing
[2:54:06] so you will know clearly everybody
[2:54:09] see you found yourself on two different
[2:54:12] roads and neither one of them is what
[2:54:15] and that is hard to say but it's the
[2:54:17] truth
[2:54:19] everybody here
[2:54:21] this one
[2:54:23] will take grace regardless of the life
[2:54:27] he's living
[2:54:29] this is the believer
[2:54:31] da accept jesus christ
[2:54:35] the guilt is taken off
[2:54:37] but their life is in the other court
[2:54:40] they are up and down
[2:54:42] everybody
[2:54:43] they fall down with a woman they fall
[2:54:45] down with a man and then tomorrow they
[2:54:47] repent and they come back again they
[2:54:49] don't mean to do it
[2:54:52] everybody here because they went to the
[2:54:54] brazen altar and praise and alter his
[2:54:57] judgment
[2:54:58] so the judgment of god is there like a
[2:55:00] whooping as soon as they do something
[2:55:02] wrong something condemned them
[2:55:05] and they come back like lord why am i
[2:55:06] keep falling on this pornography i don't
[2:55:08] want to do it i don't want to do it
[2:55:10] dare the people when you begin to preach
[2:55:14] sanctification in church they get very
[2:55:16] nervous
[2:55:20] they can hold their chair
[2:55:23] they don't like it
[2:55:24] because it's disturbing the snake
[2:55:28] do you follow me they are the people
[2:55:32] that love the sermon of encouragement
[2:55:36] and motivational speaking on tick-tock
[2:55:45] it doesn't matter where you fall god
[2:55:47] still loves you you are still his child
[2:55:50] come back he still loves you you are the
[2:55:52] prodigal so you will see them on fire
[2:55:56] everybody here you will see them in
[2:55:58] church when they say you don't have to
[2:56:00] know the seventh seal all you have to do
[2:56:02] is believe you see them jumping on the
[2:56:04] chair
[2:56:06] a lutheran
[2:56:08] because it's grace
[2:56:11] if he finds the message complicated he
[2:56:13] goes quickly to grace oh brother we will
[2:56:16] all be saved by grace yeah we will all
[2:56:18] enter in the rapture nobody nobody knows

[3:00:05] he comes back i'm sorry for speaking
[3:00:07] back to you but he already cast you
[3:00:12] that's the that's the legalist that's
[3:00:14] the that's the calvinist
[3:00:17] why because both of them have snake
[3:00:20] let's finish here
[3:00:22] you guys are pulling
[3:00:25] what is going on
[3:00:27] brother brother there was a fine young
[3:00:29] man
[3:00:31] very fine boy he was going with a little
[3:00:34] girl
[3:00:34] very fine little girl out of the fan
[3:00:37] family are those people sinners
[3:00:41] let me finish there
[3:00:43] are they sinners
[3:00:45] oh my god
[3:00:47] and this boy all of sudden
[3:00:50] came up with some kind of an idea and he
[3:00:52] just walked away and he did something
[3:00:55] wrong to the little girl and matcha has
[3:00:57] promised her to do certain things and
[3:00:59] they didn't do it and then didn't do it
[3:01:01] and instead of coming to the girl and
[3:01:03] apologizing a gentleman should do
[3:01:06] like a gentleman should do he just he
[3:01:08] was just
[3:01:10] he just was not in him to do it
[3:01:13] and the father and the mother called me
[3:01:15] on the scene to say we won't desire to
[3:01:18] know what is wrong with our boy
[3:01:21] now it is not easy to do sometime but
[3:01:24] you must be truthful and honest
[3:01:28] you can see the airport today
[3:01:31] therefore
[3:01:32] the boy
[3:01:34] was a water
[3:01:36] as far as a water
[3:01:40] you okay now
[3:01:42] he had
[3:01:45] and had been what
[3:01:49] the boy had done what him
[3:01:53] and being
[3:01:54] where is that boy
[3:01:57] you need to read brother branham very
[3:01:59] well
[3:02:00] the boy is in the other court
[3:02:03] everybody here
[3:02:04] all right
[3:02:06] repented and he has his position among
[3:02:09] the what
[3:02:10] because once you baptize the believer
[3:02:12] understand that now you're proud of us
[3:02:15] but they didn't say the boy have the
[3:02:17] holy ghost
[3:02:19] what's happened but yet he had not
[3:02:22] received the water
[3:02:24] of the holy spirit no matter how much he
[3:02:27] thought he had
[3:02:29] the boy was already in the other court
[3:02:32] and the people and the father the parent
[3:02:35] looked they say you need to get married
[3:02:38] because he comes to church
[3:02:40] he's a good boy he's a funny young man
[3:02:43] he's already grown up he started working
[3:02:45] his first job the father said you need
[3:02:47] to find your wife
[3:02:49] he start coding a girl and suddenly a
[3:02:51] bad behavior
[3:02:52] walk away the father said wait a minute
[3:02:55] what's wrong with this boy
[3:02:57] he was a good boy
[3:02:59] brother branham say they came to brother
[3:03:00] branham they said please
[3:03:02] investigate this brother branham look he
[3:03:04] said bring his blood through his blood
[3:03:06] put it on the microscope he said the boy
[3:03:09] is in another court
[3:03:12] the boy is under looter
[3:03:15] all this time in the message he was
[3:03:17] still under looter
[3:03:20] and now the gene and the father
[3:03:24] and the mother of this boy
[3:03:26] no matter how much they are converted
[3:03:29] the parent still remain in the flesh
[3:03:32] that has been interbreded out to this
[3:03:34] boy therefore the boy has got a complex
[3:03:37] in him just like from his mother's
[3:03:40] family and they are not forgiving they
[3:03:42] will not apologize that is where the
[3:03:44] boys stand
[3:03:46] because the snake is still active
[3:03:49] the flesh
[3:03:51] of this boy still have the gin
[3:03:54] and the snake is pumping his energy
[3:03:57] through the gin
[3:03:59] and suddenly the convoy flips
[3:04:06] hallelujah now i said to the father no
[3:04:10] matter how much you have raised him up
[3:04:13] now look at you out of your family all
[3:04:16] of them drunk
[3:04:17] fighting shooting and cutting and so
[3:04:19] forth now look at your family to the
[3:04:21] mother they're a bunch of people they
[3:04:23] just sit there and won't speak very
[3:04:24] independent and so forth irreverent to
[3:04:27] religion you are the only one of all
[3:04:30] your sisters and brother who are
[3:04:32] sweet kind and what
[3:04:35] what does that why are you different
[3:04:38] than your family
[3:04:41] everybody here and you are
[3:04:43] a tree
[3:04:44] part of that family tree yet you have
[3:04:47] received the water
[3:04:48] that's the things that made you
[3:04:51] and what
[3:04:52] sweet it is not your people anymore it
[3:04:55] is your
[3:04:57] that living water brother branham is
[3:04:59] showing that you parents are different
[3:05:02] because when you receive the holy spirit
[3:05:04] the holy spirit burn your stake out
[3:05:08] and block all your genes from your
[3:05:10] family that's why even your family sees
[3:05:13] you different
[3:05:14] you don't behave like them
[3:05:16] you behave like a different line of
[3:05:19] melchizedek
[3:05:22] but your boy doesn't have it yet
[3:05:25] hallelujah
[3:05:27] look at your family practically all of
[3:05:29] them are drunk and so forth and moody
[3:05:31] high tempered
[3:05:33] but you are not you are kind forgiving
[3:05:35] what is it the holy spirit you are no
[3:05:37] more what you are it is trusting you the
[3:05:40] same
[3:05:41] now the same thing has to happen to you
[3:05:45] the father rose up
[3:05:47] to brother branham
[3:05:51] what about them
[3:05:53] he rose up and said my son went to there
[3:05:59] everybody okay everybody okay
[3:06:01] my son went into the
[3:06:08] he's bragging
[3:06:09] my son went into the altar he was water
[3:06:14] look at the father on confession my son
[3:06:17] went into the
[3:06:19] and he was
[3:06:23] my son is in the other court and he
[3:06:25] think being in the other court was the
[3:06:28] deal done
[3:06:30] have you received the holy ghost since
[3:06:32] you believe
[3:06:34] my son has been baptized correctly in
[3:06:37] the name of jesus christ and what a
[3:06:38] baptism in the pool
[3:06:41] said i know my son has come to
[3:06:45] penecostal teaching even in the message
[3:06:48] because my son was at the present altar
[3:06:51] and in a level he come to jesus christ
[3:06:53] he should be good brother branham
[3:06:55] this is why
[3:06:57] you need this kind of stuff
[3:06:59] i say that may be all right
[3:07:03] all the other motion
[3:07:07] adequate he might be identified
[3:07:10] by baptism as a believer with the
[3:07:14] but until he is
[3:07:17] all
[3:07:19] i'll advise the young men to never what
[3:07:24] he shall make what
[3:07:26] no
[3:07:28] justify young men
[3:07:30] should get
[3:07:36] married this message
[3:07:42] let me read it again
[3:07:45] he shall make hell enough for her until
[3:07:48] that gentle sweet forgiving spirit of
[3:07:51] christ comes
[3:07:53] then there will be a paradox in itself
[3:07:57] to take the very water
[3:08:00] nature water
[3:08:02] of a boy that has been bred between
[3:08:04] father and mother
[3:08:06] yet in his intellectual
[3:08:09] he's still trying the what
[3:08:11] the best to do what he doesn't mean bad
[3:08:16] he doesn't understand why he did what he
[3:08:18] did
[3:08:20] he's trying to hold on the problem is
[3:08:23] he's under loot
[3:08:27] there's a wrong dosage
[3:08:31] anybody care
[3:08:33] he can do it he shall never overcome it
[3:08:36] christ will have to overcome it
[3:08:38] when he led christ
[3:08:41] then he is already overcome
[3:08:43] it shall be a perfect paradox when a man
[3:08:46] is born of the water
[3:08:48] in other words no sister should get
[3:08:51] married
[3:08:52] if this is the statue of
[3:08:55] pull a break to your relationship
[3:08:57] don't get married
[3:09:05] why because when you get married
[3:09:08] in a justified state you must make sure
[3:09:12] you speak to somebody and somebody's
[3:09:14] talking to you
[3:09:18] everybody here when you get married
[3:09:20] under justification and your husband
[3:09:23] under justification you got into a
[3:09:26] marriage with two snakes
[3:09:31] that's why you fast all the time
[3:09:35] you're gonna fast all the time
[3:09:39] nobody help somebody to move or to grow
[3:09:42] spiritually
[3:09:43] because you already reached the plateau
[3:09:46] of your relationship you cannot go
[3:09:48] higher than what you already have
[3:09:52] that's why you are worldly in your
[3:09:54] marriage
[3:09:55] that's why you more enjoy sitting and
[3:09:58] watching movie together and you think
[3:10:00] that is the pleasure of marriage you're
[3:10:03] on netflix all the time your husband is
[3:10:05] in politics the wife is over there on
[3:10:08] the facebook or she's on youtube or
[3:10:11] she's doing something and both of them
[3:10:13] are fine when you ask them i didn't see
[3:10:15] anything wrong this one say i didn't see
[3:10:17] anything wrong we didn't do we don't
[3:10:19] drink we we are born in a message i
[3:10:21] didn't see it's a marriage under looter
[3:10:30] that husband of yours
[3:10:32] one of this day you're gonna find him
[3:10:34] with naked pictures of a woman
[3:10:37] because you're living with a man with a
[3:10:39] snake in her you're living with a woman
[3:10:41] with a snake just cross him and you see
[3:10:43] that temper going up
[3:10:45] because you you got married under luther
[3:10:50] and now you expecting your husband to
[3:10:53] behave like wesley
[3:10:55] he doesn't have whistle in him you
[3:10:57] expecting the husband to behave like a
[3:11:00] pentecostal husband there is no holy
[3:11:03] ghost in the husband you cannot pull
[3:11:05] more than what he has
[3:11:07] that's why he doesn't read the brochure
[3:11:09] at home that's why he doesn't listen to
[3:11:12] the message he's fine that's why you can
[3:11:14] see him wearing shorts at home he
[3:11:16] doesn't bother him
[3:11:18] because those stuff are not important
[3:11:20] for him he's under calvinism
[3:11:27] and if you graduate to live for the wife
[3:11:31] or the husband to be under looter
[3:11:34] and then the wife and the wesley the
[3:11:37] wife will become like a hard woman to
[3:11:39] the husband
[3:11:40] and the husband see the white flesh is
[3:11:42] trying to dominate me because the wife
[3:11:44] is pushing we need to go to church you
[3:11:46] cannot stay here we need to be in church
[3:11:48] on time the wife is like
[3:11:51] she have like a little whipping all the
[3:11:53] time you cannot let the children on the
[3:11:55] on the internet like this you need to
[3:11:56] cut up the internet because mama is
[3:11:59] under wesley
[3:12:00] but that is too loose you need to let
[3:12:02] the children play the children need to
[3:12:04] be found you too much left and right
[3:12:06] brother branham leave them alone that is
[3:12:08] under looter
[3:12:14] let's stand there
[3:12:19] mama tight
[3:12:20] dad is loose
[3:12:24] sometimes daddy and mommy lose
[3:12:27] and when you look at the children they
[3:12:28] don't know no gps
[3:12:31] the children do whatever they want to do
[3:12:34] because that's how they grew up they
[3:12:35] grew up under a lutheran marriage
[3:12:38] they grew up on their westlane marriage
[3:12:41] under wesleyan marriage they grew up
[3:12:43] under trauma
[3:12:45] under the law don't do this don't touch
[3:12:47] this don't do don't do this because
[3:12:49] they're trying to force them to be
[3:12:50] christian because they are remembering
[3:12:53] armenian
[3:12:54] it's work it's work it's work
[3:12:57] one say it's grace it's grace it's grace
[3:13:00] your children don't go to church it's
[3:13:02] just one day what is the problem all the
[3:13:04] time with children being in church
[3:13:07] a lutheran father
[3:13:12] everybody here
[3:13:13] and before you know it the parent
[3:13:16] their children are completely lost
[3:13:18] everybody care
[3:13:20] and with your legalistic you're going to
[3:13:21] get tired one day
[3:13:23] and you can do no more and with your
[3:13:25] free will you love your children more
[3:13:27] than god
[3:13:30] oh don't touch my child don't do this
[3:13:32] don't do this when that child will go
[3:13:33] into the world
[3:13:35] now you will begin to pray
[3:13:37] and it's going to be a hard time for god
[3:13:39] to turn that child back from the world
[3:13:41] and bring him back again in the message
[3:13:43] because you yourself didn't have the
[3:13:45] holy ghost
[3:13:47] and you cannot produce more than your
[3:13:50] plateau
[3:13:51] you already locked for years
[3:13:54] and this is what you you're giving to
[3:13:55] your children
[3:13:57] everybody here
[3:13:58] the covenants love jokes all the time
[3:14:02] they just want to play they don't want
[3:14:03] to serious atmosphere
[3:14:05] they want to just fun fun fun fun they
[3:14:08] don't get tired of the fun
[3:14:13] when the wife wanna bring thing in order
[3:14:15] he's the one that is gonna break down
[3:14:17] everything
[3:14:21] what is feeding you
[3:14:24] what knowledge do you have more than
[3:14:26] this message
[3:14:28] when do you sit and listen to the
[3:14:29] message
[3:14:31] it's nothing i just go to church and go
[3:14:33] back and that say
[3:14:35] calvinist
[3:14:38] in the message
[3:14:40] ruth
[3:14:41] and luther
[3:14:43] if you're there
[3:14:44] it's time to come out
[3:14:47] and let's move on
[3:14:48] amen
[3:14:49] you turn around this mountain so long
[3:14:52] and it didn't help you
[3:14:54] you yourself need to go get the holy
[3:14:56] ghost
[3:14:58] and then at that point
[3:15:00] it's not going to be one side or the
[3:15:02] other
[3:15:02] you will see what the baptism of the
[3:15:04] holy ghost
[3:15:06] let's pray heavenly father
[3:15:09] lord we thank you for your grace
[3:15:11] for your love and for your mercy
[3:15:13] and for everything you have been doing
[3:15:15] for us
[3:15:16] father these messages are cutting
[3:15:19] they're hard
[3:15:21] father they're tough to swallow
[3:15:23] but that's the medication
[3:15:25] that you send father to help your
[3:15:28] children
[3:15:29] because the hour is late
[3:15:32] father no matter how much we feel
[3:15:34] impressed in our heart to do something
[3:15:37] may we sit down and set aside
[3:15:39] and check our heart
[3:15:41] to see what is motivating us
[3:15:44] what do we thirst after
[3:15:47] work on the message part we hate
[3:15:50] what kind of message part we like
[3:15:54] how do we behave when we see something
[3:15:56] going on
[3:15:57] are we picky
[3:16:00] or do we look at that through love
[3:16:04] how do we behave how do i get in this
[3:16:07] message

[3:16:14] sitting and somebody's talking to me

[3:16:34] i'm loyal to my wife i'm loyal to my
[3:16:36] husband he doesn't do anything wrong
[3:16:39] i don't see what else we have to do or
[3:16:42] start reading all these books and things
[3:16:44] like that
[3:16:45] father
[3:16:46] may you give an awakening to your
[3:16:48] children
[3:16:50] this is grace for you to open these
[3:16:52] doors
[3:16:53] so that they understand nobody is trying
[3:16:55] to this christianized them
[3:16:57] nobody's nailing them down
[3:17:00] you are only showing them where they are
[3:17:03] because the requirement of this age is
[3:17:05] higher
[3:17:06] than looter
[3:17:08] it is not just coming to the altar and
[3:17:10] being baptized
[3:17:12] it is not just getting into the holiest
[3:17:15] holy place
[3:17:16] but they must go all the way to the
[3:17:18] holiest
[3:17:20] until that snake is completely burned up
[3:17:23] and they know the new creation and
[3:17:26] whatever can happen father they can meet
[3:17:28] you on the other side or meet you into
[3:17:31] the air

[3:17:34] hand
[3:17:35] the such precious brothers and sisters
[3:17:38] but father i cannot decrease the dosage
[3:17:40] of the medication
[3:17:42] i have to give it the way it was given
[3:17:45] lord may you help them
[3:17:47] may you help them legalistic
[3:17:49] understanding that they cannot master
[3:17:51] that snake
[3:17:53] they have been hiding so long
[3:17:56] struggling within themselves
[3:17:58] and covering themselves under religion
[3:18:01] but they still struggle and it's not
[3:18:03] helping
[3:18:04] and the other has been too loose
[3:18:06] until
[3:18:07] when they are at their work nobody
[3:18:09] desire to be like them
[3:18:11] because there is no difference between
[3:18:13] them and the people in their work
[3:18:15] father may we get to that christianity
[3:18:19] that is intended for this hour with the
[3:18:21] proper dosage until
[3:18:24] people will see jesus christ
