this today is the building fund right offering so the trustee okay brother mike say that's right so check amen that's the trustee he said it so check amen so at the end of the service if you just remember the lord's willing we can just drop whatever the lord put in your heart and we keep moving as we're going it's going it's moving but we're going away for the finances amen so just be patient we will be there one of this day if the lord terry somehow we're gonna be in there amen remember next sunday next saturday it's gonna be our house meeting at brother kelly's home so brother david please if you would send the address and everything you know how everything goes so if somebody still have a question i left the question box at home you can hand it to the deacon and we can handle it from there so throughout the week i will try to look over and make sure we get it covered i'm not uh to the best of my understanding i might be wrong but did somebody ask a question in the last meeting about why was the woman designed by the devil by designed by the devil or something like that marriage and divorce did somebody ask that question was that a question oh okay okay i thought somebody did ask that but if it's not that's fine lord's willing we will get into that next sunday lord's willing if everything goes well we will have brother there award so if you don't know him probably by name you're going to see him by face and you're going to remember him and if you don't know him at all just stand there and you're going to see how the anointing dropped from heaven he's an anointed preacher these are hard men to get in the schedule because they're busy left and right but this has been scheduled for quite a while so lord's willing next sunday you're going to have brother day reward so we anticipating a great time there and you pray for the house meeting and you pray for everything so that all will be well by the grace of god if you have any question about the house meeting the deacons handle those because it's spiritual and include food so it belongs to the deacon you can talk to them and we go from there amen begin to understand why the high heel has been held for so long but i found out that whatever we were going through was really a foundation to get to the high heels so lord's willing on the oncoming service i'm gonna get on the clothing and the high heel so stay tight but i'm gonna lay a strong foundation today so we can use it and soar with it if you miss it today you won't understand why it's wrong so you gotta understand today why what is what is going on behind once you get it just like when you caught hiddenism then you understand why all the makeup and the and the hearing and everything else fed away so there is a key here that you need to understand if you understand thank you very much musician if you understand the key about how the woman was made then everything else about the clothing and the high heel and everything else will flow through it amen so be in prayer stay alert i already know those who sleep in church so i keep watching and giving time and i'm praying for them at home i say lord please wake them up please wake them up so if you continue to sleep then i have to talk to you and see what is going on amen i'm a pastor i see everybody so i know who sleep in church and i know who frequently sleep in church amen so if you work at night i understand you're trying the best and i'm praying for you i have been praying i pray i cast that devil away so you stay awake because somebody is trying to rob you from the blessings of god because as soon as the service is over you dare you wide awake amen and whatever what's going on here you're not there especially young people it really bothers me so i have been praying and watching and giving grace and giving grace if we continue then secretly i will have to reach out and see what is going on how we can pray for you and deliver you and the lord deliver you from that spirit of sleeping i hate when we like are you looking at and i see somebody like this and i'm like wait a minute where are you at what were you doing last night amen were you on the window were you on the window of jezebel or what were you looking at the wind of jezebel i don't know so pray that everything goes well amen yes and one more thing before we get into our reading our service started 11 o'clock not at 12 o'clock not at 11 45 as a pastor i cannot see something going wrong and me keeping my mouth shut remember your pastor i would never face the lord jesus christ with your blood in your hand the worship is a part of the service and it's very important the offering is a part of the service it's very important the preaching of the word is part of the service and it's vip very very very important amen so when you always miss the worship and you're coming late every sunday every wednesday except if you have a legitimate uh reason something is wrong amen people are already in seven and you're coming you're at zero so we gotta pump you up to get you up to seven to catch up the people and if we go to the building we're not going to be having service at 11 we're going to start having service earlier because we're going to introduce the sunday school so if you don't you are not here on time when the service is at 11 o'clock i wonder how you're going to be on time in sunday school i've seen people that never have never probably even been in sunday school for years and they're fine i even heard one who say i will go to sunday school only when my kids are old enough so sunday school means nothing for her and if i give you quote about sunday school some of you will begin to even repent so remember the service is a little eleven o'clock so before 11 o'clock you should be here pray praying sitting reading your scripture so when the song service started you begin to worship god amen and then you go through the song service and everything but the service started eleven o'clock you show up at 11 45. it's every start at 11 o'clock you show up at 12 o'clock over and over and over and over you have a problem with your time it is not good it is not acceptable it is not pleasing god amen because at your job you always on time amen even if we have problem with gas you're going to manage to find gas for next week because you don't want to miss your paycheck amen so remember if you're doing that for a job that will sooner will stay in this home in this world and we're going to go to heaven how much more the house of god so dragging being late is not good we cannot be starting reading the service and that's the time you enter amen amen if they call you to a party you're going to be there on time if they call you to a job you're going to be there on time if they call you to an interview you're going to be there in time but every day late in church late in church late in church that is not good that is not acceptable i'm a spiritual father as far as a pastor i would never shut my mouth to tell you something when it's wrong amen that is love it's always corrective amen let's go to our scripture this morning genesis chapter 2. if you know we got service in the morning you better go to sleep on time if you're not working you better go to bed on time you cannot be on facebook or what's up till 2 a.m and then you expect to be here a week and be here on time amen then when it's sunday night toward monday then you're going to sleep on time because you got to be at work it's a condition of the heart amen and sometimes you're not even far brother did not drive four hours gotta deny four hours four hours there's nobody here that dropped four hours do you know what time brother did not get here in church amen he usually come one one week and then the other week he's streaming come next week and see what time brother did not get here four hours driving in the morning so when you're still sleeping he's driving already when he gets here that's the time you wake up and you start fixing yourself something is wrong this time of the message is no more plain church it is no more the time when you go to church we socialize we go to the restaurant we laugh for everything this is home amen we got to prepare to meet the lord into the air amen you don't want to be late in the rapture amen genesis chapter two you got two kids you got three kids it takes you an hour or 45 minutes so wake up a little bit earlier do you know what time i sleep to prepare the sermon ask my wife we'll tell you do you know what time i go to bed you're already sleeping genesis chapter 2 so if you think you loaded come and talk to me i will show you who is loaded genesis chapter 2 verse 19 if he hurt that's very good then he will go you very good if he hurt if he doesn't hurt and you're doing it so something is wrong so you got to say ouch it's a it's a it's a mystery of the castor oil of brother branham you say castor is not in the bible do you know the the the tree that god made for noah are for jonah that's the three that make the castle this message is perfectly in line like this with the scripture genesis chapter 2 somebody asked even a question on a necklace and i answered that in the house meeting and i found the scripture why brother branham gave the answer he gave and out of the ground the lord god form every beast of the field we already talk about this and every file of the air if you're the one spending time in the bathroom and putting people behind you need to stop that one because people can be at church late because of you spending too much time in the bathroom you take a shower longer and you put everybody behind because they don't want to leave your home yeah it just dropped so i have to release it and every file of the air and brought them to adam to see what he would call them and whatsoever adam call every living creature that was the name thereof we already explained this that everything else was created from the ground god spoke and he came out god spoke and he came out amen you might be seated and adam gave's name gave names to all caddo and to the file of the air and to every beast of the field but for adam there was not found a help meet in other words a helper suitable that fit a help meet for him everything was paired paired male female male female male female when god created adam in the spirit he was male female but in the body adam was only male it's a masculine expression which was showing the head amen now verse 21 and satan caused a deep sleep to fall upon adam caused the deep ship to fall i hope you don't have that deep sleep in church amen [Music] who calls the deep sleeper who's performing the creation of evil amen and the lord god caused a deep sleep to fall upon adam and he slept and he took one of his ribs something that he's already created amen and close up the flesh instead thereof verse 22 and the rib that was already created manufactured already which the lord god has taken from the man not satan not satan it is god who's doing that everybody clear not satan this is a tough part of the message not satan it is god amen and the way which the lord god had taken from man he made he a water who made the woman who created the woman god created the woman so who created the sisters oh god relax and the weed which the lord god has taken from men made he a woman and brought her to men do you see anything that the devil is doing here do you see the intervention of the devil here okay verse 23 and adam say this is now born of my bones she's a rib and flesh of my flesh she shall be called woman because she was taken out of men it's a by-product a product of the product we already explained this therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother and shall cling to his wife it's a part of him amen and there shall be one flesh and they both were naked the man and his wife and were not ashamed in other words when the woman was created by god both the woman and the man was in the stage of innocency anybody clear because the black dog is blocked amen he was there but it was dormant he was not awakened yet anybody clear let's go to chapter 3 verse 6. and when the woman saw now it is the devil dealing with the woman this is the first time we are we have been informing the scripture that the devil have an interaction with the woman amen i just keep the other one because you know and when the woman saw that the tree was good for food who showed her so there was a session that set ahead with eve and satan show if certain things amen and when the woman saw with a different wisdom we already explained that wisdom is sensual based on the senses on the feelings and when it's in the book of james and when the woman saw that the tree was good for food and that it was pleasant to the eye and a tree to be desired now there was something in eve eve saw that tree all this time and never felt compelled to go get it but with the teaching of satan amen with the teaching of satan eve begin to last after that tree the teaching of satan awakened the last the black dog that was sleeping everybody clear and when she saw that the tree to be desired to make one wise she took off the fruit thereof and did it ever clear if you ask eve what happened if you ask the devil he will say eve took that herself she didn't take it herself that tree was already there if there is something that the devil did to eve that caused the eve to take the tree and eat it we already know what that eating means in the book of proverbs such is a way of a prostituted woman she eat it and wipe off her mouth you already know that she took off the fruit thereof and did eat and gave also to her water to her husband with her and he did water so the one who taught adam how to eat the fruit his own and the one who taught the woman was who so eve thought adam to do adam didn't know what to do amen adam was living with eve all this time and never do what to do adam could wake up in the morning and hug is nothing wrong he doesn't say anything he could hold eve by the hand and they're going together and he slapped eve and he slapped him and nothing happened and they were naked and when they look at each other adam doesn't see anything amen but this time adam when he looked at eve something is a little bit different who opened the eyes everybody clear everybody clear so far jump to verse 11. and he said do you see how much we've been in this book of of genesis and he keep opening up the seventh seal and he said who told you that you were naked adam say i'm thinking every time god comes adam adam where are you you say i'm right here brother father adam where are you i'm right here father this time adam where are you i'm hiding what is going on i am naked wait a minute all this time you were blind the black dog was closed who told you in other words who taught you the stuff that you know now who told you that you were naked amen have you do water so that knowledge is a knowledge that is connected to the eating and the eating is a sexual relationship it is a sexual relationship knowledge amen knowledge anybody clear in other words god is asking adam if you are answering me as you are naked who taught you sexual relationships where did you learn that i hide it from you who gave it to you somebody heard the principle of life the maha we already explained that have you eaten off the tree whereof i commanded you that you should not eat adam where did you learn it verse 12 and the men say the water in other words this is my teacher amen did you do this the one who taught me this stuff is right here everybody clear the woman whom you gave me you gave to be with me she gave me of the water he was not the devil that gave adam the tree he was the woman that taught adam the tree and what to do amen gave me the tree and i did eat it now retracing the origin the root verse 13 and the lord god said to the woman what is this that you have done in other words god didn't say what is this that you have known what is this that you have water so eve did something to adam you understand the devil satan the serpent did something to evil and eve took the knowledge and did it on adam everybody clear what is this that you have done and the woman said the water the serpentine water began me and i did what in other words i learned from the devil the devil taught me that and i am the one who taught my husband eve became an instrument or an agent of satan the woman become the agent of satan the woman become a tool of satan everybody here she become the one that is actually reflecting the knowledge of satan if you don't know about what satan is thinking go check the woman let's go to proverb chapter 6. amen you see why the gospel is tied to the sister you see now why now question god created the woman amen who start teaching the woman sexual relationship was a god or satan remember that question who start teaching if sexual relationship will say adam or satan keep those questions in mind and you're going to see brother brother and we'll ask you the same question proverb chapter 6 if you're there you can say amen verse 23 for the commandment is the lamp and the law is light and reproof of instruction are the way of life to keep you from the evil woman a woman that is already infected with that knowledge from the flattery of the tongue because the devil was the one that's slicker but branham said watch that slicker now it is that anointing is on a woman amen from the flattery of the tongue of a strange woman we already explained you this verse 25 last not not love it's a lustful love last not after her water remember there were three things we talked about them the first one the woman controls by water by beauty the second one is water and the third one is water all of this existed before but adam was neutralized to it adam so eve nothing happened adam saw eve walking nothing happened adam saw the shape of eve naked nothing happened adam saw everything about even nothing happened until the serpent brought a gospel of sex last note after her beauty in your heart neither let her take you with her water the only thing they are talking about the beauty here the focus is on the eyes why eyes why amen for by means of a worrish woman a man is brought to a piece of bread and the adulteress will hunt for the precious life everybody clear so far go to proverbs 7. amen verse 6 and 4 verse 6 for at the water a window a window jesus looking at the window for at the window of my house i look through my casement so the window gives you access to the outside amen if you are in your home and you want to know what is going on outside just go into the window amen but today even though your house doesn't have a window there is another window that you can open and that window will tell you what is going on in africa what is going on in washington what is going on in tennessee what is going on in canada what is going on in sister saw and soul house a window not only gives you access to the outside but a window give the outsider access into your house it is two ways amen if you are in your house and you want to look outside you can look through the window but if somebody is outside and they want to see your house all they have to do is click on your window because on your window you have been uploading stuff for them you don't need to go to somebody else's house to know how the what is the color of their couch you don't need to drive your car and go to brother so

you're gonna see what kind of car do they have you're gonna see what kind of flower you don't have you're going to know the color of the house you will know everything through the window and a window have been updated every day for at the window of my house i looked through my casement and i beheld among the simple one i discerned among the youth a young man void of understanding we already explained you this passing through the street near her corner and he went away to her house in the twilight in the evening in the black and dark knight and behold they made him a woman with an attire of water a whole lot and a saddle heart that comes from genesis she is loud and stubborn that's a problem her feet abide not in her house paul said to timothy that let the women be keeper of water but these women don't stay home amen now she is without now in the street and lie in weight at every corner so she called him it's the woman doing that remember it's eve teaching and she called him and kiss him with an impudent face she already got anointed amen said to him i have peace offering with me this day have i paid my vow everybody cleared so far now let's go to matthew chapter 5 and we will be praying a window of the home amen that window can be static when you click you know what is going on or that window can be live amen we have a static window that somebody will pass by and say oh i see a curtain there i see a curtain there but we have also a lovely window when you can call you might be in your house you call somebody you click you click and you see each other yet you are far away in the distance but that window help you access them and they also access you at the same minute matthew chapter 5 just like those that stream are at the window matthew 5 27 you have heard that he was said by them of all time you shall not commit water adultery the old time you have to do it physically amen they have to catch you doing it now jesus comes and begin to trace it from where he started verse 28 but i said to you that whosoever looks on a man why a woman why not a man whosoever look on a woman to do what adam was looking at eve and never lasted but for this first time when adam comes he looks as if something is different because eve is displaying something else whosoever looked at a woman to last after her has committed adultery with her already in her water so oh that scene that's going to transpire later already happened in the heart by just one look the devil caught him who caused the problem the woman let's pray heavenly father lord we thank you again for your grace your love your mercy father and for everything you have been doing for us father thank you for giving us an opportunity to gather together around the reveal word of the hour lord we thank you for this message and we thank you for the revelation and opening our eyes to see exactly the plan of redemption for this end time lord may the devil and his army be completely sealed out of this place may only the holy spirit come and anoint your children open our heart understanding lord and speak to us and father bless us in the most powerful way in the name of jesus christ amen god bless you you've already been seated drop this i had to pick it up amen we talked about the woman jezebel it's in part 37. when we talk about jezebel we found that there were three things that jezebel done because we already dealt with her in the spiritual aspect and now we are still dealing with the natural aspect of her we found out that the first thing jezebel did she did what she painted her face we already went through that the second thing jezebel did she did what she tied her head with brother brandon explained that it was the cutting of the hair and through the cutting of the hair we found out that it was something wrong because you are actually disobeying or disrespecting the head everybody clear so far and we already explained about the head the bible said when jehu was come to jezreel jesus jew was coming jezebel heard of it and she painted her face we already explained this and tied her head we already explained this and look out at the window this is where we're going to start today amen what is going on with this window of jezebel verse 31 and as jihoo entered in the inn at the gate she said has zimri peace if you study the scripture and you check the word zimmery zimri was actually somebody who was a criminal he was a general or a commander into the army and he went and betrayed the king and actually assassinated the king and took over the throne so what happened here was god anointed jehu to bring judgment into the house of ahab and jew who went and killed the king of israel and killed the king of judah and as jew was approaching where jezebel was jezebel heard already the story that the king had been killed by jihoo so what she was saying by calling into remembrance zimri she was actually portraying or she was actually looking at you as a criminal as somebody who have assassinated the king as a commander into the army that killed the king so she was saying is this commander is this us uh uh is this man this criminal is he coming for peace or is he coming from war everybody clear so far so she said exemplary which was a criminal peace who slew his water that's what zimri actually did and he lift up his face to the water so jezebel had a specific window that she knew that when jehu approaches the city the first thing that jihoo will lay hands on will be laying hands on the window when you look at the woman right here i not joy woman good so sister you forgive me everybody clear this is a person here this is a woman with a dress right there amen when we enter our home we enter our home by the door everybody clear so far but when you are inside your home and you want to access the outside or you want the outside to access you all you have to do is you gotta go through the window everybody clear the window doesn't show your feet are we clear the window does not show your waist the window usually show you as a portrait ever clear but before jezebel pop up on her portrait she have to fix herself a certain way in order to appear and to face this oncoming invader of the army which was jiho and what she did she painted her face and she fixed her hair a certain way to meet jiho what was the purpose of painting her face and fixing her hair before she appeared on the window and he lift up his face to the window and say who is on my side who and there look out to him two or three eunuchs and he said throw her down so they threw her down and some of her blood was sprinkled on the wall and on the horses and he threw her under the foot so when jehu looked at jezebel instead of jihu admiring jezebel instead of jew being attracted by jezebel instead of jew being taught by jezebel or give way to what jezebel was trying to do for some reason there was an anointing that was given on jehu that resisted whatever jezebel could do and actually destroy the very intention of jezebel everybody clear so far now as we look at the window what is going on with a window anybody clear the first time a window was spoken in the bible the window was broken in the ark of noah when god told noah to better to build the ark at the top god told noah go ahead and put a window everybody clear so far so god was the one that closed the door to the ark you can check your scripture and when the door to the oak was closed everybody cleared there was no access between the outside world that was going into chaos and doom for destruction and the inside of the ark everybody cleared when the animal were outside the ark of the outside of the ark of noah the lion could eat the zebra anybody care when the animal were outside the ark of noah a leopard could kill a goat but when those animals were put together inside the ark of noah for some reason as soon as the lion entered the ark of noah the lion stopped chasing the goat the lion started chasing the horse the leopard stop from chasing the dog everybody was in peace so there was a different atmosphere inside the ark of noah versus outside the earth of noah in other words the inside of the ark of noah had a different world than the outside of the ark there was a world inside the ark that was dominated by the spirit of god and there was another world that was outside the ark that was actually dominated by a judgment spirit of death from the devil everybody clear but to get access to connect the two world we needed a window ever created so far that was the first time a window was spoken in the bible and when we look at this window out of this window there were two birds that could go and come inside the window the window could buff be used by the crop everybody clear and the window could be used by the dolphin the dove could go out of the window and come back into the window and also the crowd could access the same thing so that window could be a blessing oh that window could be a curse anybody clear why because the two birds which symbolizes the true spirit have access into your god-given house by the window or by that same window as spirit can cut out everybody so far the next time we find another window in the scripture was when the spies went to rehab the prostitute ever cleared so far when the spies enter into rehab the prostitute and they were under the pressure of the state the state was chasing after the two preachers to catch them they were one way of exiting they could no longer exit the house the door of the house but they could use the window as an emergency exit so a window can be an emergency door when you are in cad situation when you don't know what to do a window can be turned into a door and a rahab used that window to free the two preachers everybody here and the preacher told her you see that window don't leave it like that if you leave that window like that when judgment is coming it's going to destroy your window and when you destroy your window it could also destroy your house and will destroy everything that is in your house you must put a token to the window a window must have a token when you are using a window you must have the token if you don't have the token that we know can be a new choice for the crow everybody clear so far i know it's a different avenue hang tight with me another place is when saul was chasing after david and david was already married to the daughter of soul and soul came and the people came at night and they wanted to kill david when they came at night to kill and destroy david they only accidental dakuji that could be used in case of emergency was a window in the bible in first samuel chapter 19 verse 11 the bible says so also sent messengers unto david house to watch him and to slay him in the morning just like they were trying to get the spies and slay them and mikhail david's wife told him saying if that save not their life tonight tomorrow that shall be slain in other words they're gonna kill you so mika let david down through the water just like rahab let the two preacher down through the window ever clear let david down through a window and he went and fled and escaped so david used a window in an emergency situation as a way of escape everybody cleared so far but it was not meant for that you must enter by the door and you must exit by the door but in case of emergency when you're under pressure a window can be used to exit the third time we see another exited window was the apostle paul everybody clear in acts chapter 9 verse 23 the bible says and after that many years days were fulfilled the jews took counsel to kill him to kill paul but there laying a weight was known of soul in other words the project the plan was disclosed and they watched the gate day and night to do water so he could not exit by the gate then the disciple took him by night and let him down by the wall in the water the bible says here in acts chapter 9 that they led him down by the wall amen if you don't search the scripture clearly you thought that they went over the wall and they been there and they pitched him over that's the way he exited but that was not the case because a window usually is on the wall in second corinthians chapter 11 verse 32 the bible gave us more clarification in damascus the governor under arrest us the king kept the city of damascene with a garrison desires to apprehend me and through a water a window in the water these two scriptures don't contradict themselves because god gives a first revelation remember then he give a second revelation to help you understand better the first revelation the window is usually on the wall but the first scripture was not as specific as the second one and through a window in a basket was not let down by the water so the wall is there but it's more specific it's not just the wall but it's the window through the wall everybody cleared so far so through a window in a basket was i let down by the wall and escape his hands everybody clear so in these three cases right here we found out that this window have been used as a door of escape in cases of emergency everybody clear with rahab it he helped two preachers escape and those preachers we already know brother branham said that they played temple they didn't have tape back then but actually the tape was made flesh in other words they were only repeating what joshua already said albert here the second window was an exit for a pastor in ezekiel chapter 34 and i will set up one water a shepherd is a pastor over them and he shall feed them even myself and who he shall feed them and he shall be their worker david was a shepherd that's why when judgment was falling upon israel david told god that i am the one who sinned what about his sheep because god has been training him to keep the ship because he's going to be a future pastor everybody clear then the third window here made a way of escape to the messenger everybody clear when in case of emergency are you following me a window can be used to make an escape for preacher in case of an emergency a window can be used to make a way of escape for a pastor in case of an emergency a window can be used to make a way of escape for a messenger because the two spies were under the pressure of the state and david was under the pressure of a religious brattle soul and paul was under the pressure of a religious power that was with the jews amen when you under a power of the civil and the religious the civil and the ecclesiastical power in other words when the beast that came out of the earth which have to hold them the civil and the ecclesiastical power begin to put pressure upon the church of the living god to shut the church to close the church not wanting anybody to worship in the church a window can be used for minister to preach the gospel [Applause] did you get it yes yes when it's time our title when the government begin to put pressure on the message churches and don't want the church to happen and don't want the church to operate you have a right to use your internet as a preacher to preach the gospel [Music] it can be used to preach for a pastor it can be used as an emergency window to let open the message are you following me so not only was under religious power but actually a demonic power a demon came upon soul and when you have a combination of political power and religious power and demonic power it is a power and aggression from the pelvis and the pelvis work with the dragon which is the woman the power that comes from the sea but it's the power from america that's going to bring the squeeze and in the time of squeezing in the time of pandemic in the time of tightness in the time when you are sick in the time when you can make it to church for a legitimate reason you can use the window anybody clear so far another window was found in the book of daniel now when daniel knew that the riding was sun they put pressure on the church he went into his house and and his windows being opened in his chamber to arduino the window of daniel was not open to see what was going on in the kingdom of babylon and back here the window of daniel was not open to see what was going on in europe the window of daniel was now open to check what was going on in the political realm the window of daniel was open in the direction of jerusalem to keep his prayer life up [Applause] we are using the tree of knowledge of guild and evil that we need a token that tree must keep you up in your spiritual life but not use it as a dog to access different worlds his window being opened in his chamber toward jerusalem he kneeled down upon his knees three times a day and prayed and gave thanks before his god as he did the fourth time so before pressure comes daniel used his window wisely and when pressure came he continued to do the same thing his window kept him in the right direction toward jerusalem why was his window turned toward jerusalem in 1st king chapter 8 verse 44 if the people go out to the battle against their enemy whichever that shall send them and shall pray unto the lord toward the water what was that city which god has chosen and toward the house that i have built for that name then here down in heaven their prayer and their supplication and maintain their cause and so return unto thee with all the heart and with all the soul in the land of their enemy which led them away captive and prey on to detour the land which that gave us unto their father come on the city which they have chosen jerusalem karma and their house which they have built for their name come on then he died the prayer and the supplication in heaven that dwelling place and mantender calls god out of all israel he chose the city of jerusalem and in jerusalem they built the temple amen and god dwell in that temple and solomon told god that if somebody is in trouble and if he is far away amen if he can see jerusalem but not really jerusalem but remember the temple that is in jerusalem but not really the temple but remember the god that is inside the temple if they pray that way i will automatically hear the prayer but if they cannot see jerusalem if they know their gps and they can turn toward the country of israel and when they begin to pray they begin to think about jerusalem and when they begin to think about jerusalem they go deep in the prayer on the temple and after the temple on the god that was on the temple you must heal them amen now that's the reason why when jonah was in the west body barely he was always thinking about the direction of jerusalem and when he prayed god commanded the fish to deliver him ever clear daniel used the window to keep him straight with god chosen place of worship and god chosen place of worship today is what the message of the hour use your window use your computer to keep you in line with the message of the hour [Applause] are you there stop using your window for pornography stop using your window for politics because a window needed a token hallelujah he uses his window to you to be connected into the right direction one time the church was open and there was no pressure anymore from the state and no pressure from the ecclesiastical everything was fine and the church was open the pandemic restrictions were lifted and people could go to church and assemble themselves about here and worship god then paul went into the church and paul began to preach and as paul began to preach despite the fact that the church was open despite the fact that it was not an emergency situation yet somebody chose to go on the window and to sit on the window and listen to the sermon instead of coming into the church [Music] am i reading a different bible in the book of fact chapter 20 and upon the first day of the week when the disciple came together to break bread paul preach unto them ready to depart on the moral and continue his speech until midnight he preached longer and there were many lights in the upper room where they were gathered together and there sat in at the water so the church was open there was a place for him to come and to sit in the church it was not a case of emergency it was not that he was sick it was not that he was at his work but he chose deliberately to stay at home and to watch the sermon of power on the window they sat in a window a certain young man named you tickers being fallen into a water those that are streaming online if you can get the vaccine go get your vaccine if you can use your mask and come to church because none of you stop going to work but if the emergency situation has been removed and you still choose to stay at home when the church is open the window have an access to a spirit of death [Applause] being fallen in a deep sleep and as paul was long preaching he sunk down with sleep and fell down from the third loft and was taken up by who he didn't want to sit in the sanctuary amen he chose to stay home because there is a storm outside he chose to stay home because he feel too tired there is no sacrifice and the people have been staying at home under the false reason of pandemic even though the vaccine is dead they don't want to get vaccinated because they got used to that sleeping spirit they can go to ahmad they can go to our green they can go to their work the last thing that they want to think of is coming to the church you talk to them there is a pandemic going on there is also a vaccine out there power went down and fell on him and impressed him thank god for grace trouble not yourself for his life is in him and when he therefore was come up again and has broken the bread and eaten and talked a long while even till break day of the day so he deported and they brought the young men alive his name means fortunate and they brought the young man alive and were not a little comforted in other words he got his resurrection what i'm saying this is a window is used in case of emergency if you have a legitimate reason you can use the window but if your reason is not legitimate you better check your heart because when jesus invited the people to the feast the reason that was given to jesus were all legitimate reason and yet jesus was not pleased with legitimate reason because it was a way for them to escape it's a way to stay at home and don't come to church because the window is open paul was preaching the church was open but this young man chose not to be in church but to sat on the window and death got him there because the window is a door that can bring the club and it is also a door that can bring the dog everybody clear so far paul preached longer now heavenly father we are thankful for the blood of christ and many sometimes praise god that that servant lord does not use water by speaking water but i may fail like paul that preached all night one night a little fellow fell out on the window and got killed and that apostle with the word of god in his life went and led his body over the boy life came in him and he lived again brother branham is saying here that sometimes he speaks so long out of a lack of wisdom brother stephen say amen to that paul preached this same gospel all night and somebody fell out in the upper story window and kill himself and paul lay his body on he come back to life again many of us sat up and watched the leg show and we go to dances and parties and stay oh but if the preacher is over 20 minutes i shall never go back again our hearts and right with god our soul feeding on something else beside who we are balancing the two we cannot keep the people longer but we also need to give god a sacrifice i know it's a little late but remember the day our boss asked us to work a little water oh what you agree with it you even look for over time because you're gonna get more money [Music] amen i'm saying amen to all three courts amen they want you to work a little overtime or something what about the worship of the lord many times they preach all night in the bible time a little time for god you get upset [Music] you can go to a party five hours and he won't do you any good amen verily verily i say unto you he the emperor if not by the water in the sheepfold but climb up some other way the same is the word and the water the one who uses the window is a fifth [Music] jesus except if you use it in the case of emergency hallelujah but he died entering by the door is the shepherd of the ship the window is used by who a fifth and water i'm sorry i gotta say it because you keep coming god say when you don't pay your taxes [Applause] and you don't pay your offering you are if you are robbing god i hope you when you're on the window you're paying your offering and your tithe joe 2 verse 9 they shall run 2 and 4 in the sin the city they shall run upon the wall they shall climb up upon their houses they shall enter in at the water like a water everybody clear jeremiah 9 21 for who death is come up into our world that's why this boy lost his life sitting on the window when the door of the church was open he preferred to sit on the window listening to the sermon instead of coming in he didn't know that death uses also the window just like the dove can come out of the window the crow also will come into the window for death he's come up into our windows and he's entered our water death get access on the window and once he gets on the window he is going to invade the house to cut off the word is everybody saying thing death is looking for a way to come to your house death doesn't know how to come to your house hollywood is looking for a way to come to your house hollywood doesn't have access to the house that's why brother brother say that we used to go to the movie theater to watch movie but the devil took television and broadened to your home it is a window that the devil opened so hollywood can access your homework and when he gets to your home he's coming after the water the children your internet must have a token because jezebel uses the window death is come upon our windows and enter into our palaces in your houses to cut off the children from without and the young men from the water that's why the one that struggle the most with our cell phone is the youth and the children they get hooked so much the parent knows they're using that to text they're using that for the business they're using that to talk but the younger one are more inclined to the game the more inclined to the movie the more inclined in netflix and before you know it it is killing them spiritually they know more about the movie then they know about the message of the hour our houses have time to watch movie how many movies do you watch a week how many sermons have you watched in that same house in one week you forget that death enter the window and he gets into the kids he gets into the young man and even get into the parent and their parents become lovers of movie give me your netflix account let's check your story let me see your cell phone let's see how many stuff do you watch that have nothing to do with your spiritual life it is all about the gossip on facebook the gossip on what's happening hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord a window is a door to the spirit a window is only used in case of emergency a window can be an entrance of a wrong spirit when you open your window and you watch pornography you open the door to the spirit in your house and before you know it you begin to struggle the kids are struggling check the window check what is entering into the window check your cell phone because brother branham said if the television is wrong how much more the what the telephone when brother branham said that we didn't have internet on the telephone but today which one is worst is the television box or the telephone the prophet was right he's seen far away he knew that the internet would be on your telephone everything will be on your telephone now your telephone is the window the devil uses to get you the window the devil uses for the young kid the window the devil uses to get your children it is only to be used in case of emergency or use it as daniel to keep you straight in your spiritual life everybody clear so far it is not to make you lazy when the door of the church is open you still don't want to come to church you can go anywhere else except the church because you're going to watch it on television because you're going to stream it and sit at home and drink coffee [Music] hallelujah a man when the king came to see the guest he saw there was a man which not had which head on where which had not on a wedding garment why did this man don't have a wedding garment why he never uses the door amen he enter by the window the mystery of the window are you there he saw there a man which had not on a wedding garment and he said unto him friend because you love the messenger how cometh dying hidden not having a wedding water and he was what he can't even talk anything amen amen amen who is your pastor your pastor is a window now i wish i had room i put it over there the virgin the wedding supper see how this man got in here at the wedding supper and he come in some other way here was the door jesus said i am the door and this wedding table was sitting here and the people all sitting around and here was one man up here that didn't have a wedding garment on and when the king came in he said how did you get here my friend how did you ever get in here it showed he didn't come in by this door he went in at the water oh come in the back way oh through some creeds oh denomination he didn't come by the water hallelujah what is wrong with jezebel window brother stephen i understand the window what about jezebel anybody clear so far when jihu was come to jezreel jezebel heard it and he pantipanted her face we already explained this she tied her head we already explained it she look out at the water we understand what a window is brother branham explained to us what was the motive of jezebel now a long line of the king had come down ahab the wicked one had been shot by a bow and kill and jezebel was thrown out of the water as she tried to do water or to do water oh jehu when he drove down and he had the eunuch to throw her down the window in the street in the rejected king let me tell you something ladies i am not making fun of you this is not a place for that this is a place for judge for judgment goes forth and judgment has to go right and judgments by the word of god there was only one woman in the entire bible that ever done water painted her face one woman and she never painted her face to meet her painted her face to meet her to try to do atom that was who so jezebel window is a public everybody following me a public exposition of yourself everybody clear in their intent to cause lust or to cause an attraction i'm going to repeat again the window of jezebel is a public exposition of a woman in their intent to cause lust or to seduce somebody jezebel did it to seduce jiho that's why she asked is he coming for peace because ahab was already dead she wanted to get another man everybody clear je who was a man of god akahab was a make believer he got a hub and he got the help killed now there is another anointed that is coming up now she tried to get the second anointing and to kill her but in order to get that anointed she must present herself at the window in the intent to cause lust or to seduce everybody clear so far revelation 2 20 notwithstanding i have a few things against thee because that suffered that woman who on which call herself what to do what and to do what the anointing of jezebel teaches the man me go back again hallelujah are you awake is everybody awake is everybody awake hallelujah which color for yourself say what them to do what and to do what to seduce my water the servant has our demand my prophet everybody clear the anointing of jezebel has not only a power of seduction but the anointing of jezebel have a power of teaching what is she teaching everybody here to teach and to seduce my servant to commit to act so if you don't know fornication you don't know how to have sex jezebel can teach you let me go back to the reading taught adam how to do it anybody clear i'm speaking plain and mr online i'm speaking to this church who thought if how to do it who taught jezebel how to do it teach and to seduce my servant to commit water and to do what [Applause] eight fake sacrifice unto us we which were forbidden for the children of god because there are four types of love agape love feel your love lustful love and filthy love but she's gonna teach you how to do the last two he said the spirit speaketh especially that in the latter time that they depart from the faithful that they depart from the faith and will give him to do all to water interesting spirit you know what seduces a seducing spirit in the church that is what are you there seducing clergy spirit working off what hypocrisy in the world they're gonna teach you that you can wear makeup you won't do anything they're going to teach you that there is nothing wrong about you putting paint it is jezebel begin to teach the church to go back to the old staff because jezebel not only will bring an anointing for you to seduce but see jezebel will anoint the preacher to teach you those kind of stuff everybody clear so far everybody clear so far what is going on with jezebel and teaching let's go to song of solomon chapter four hallelujah the window of jezebel it's a public exposition in the intent to seduce in the intent to cause lust in the intent to make men look unto me in the intent that when i portray myself jehu will see me when jew sees me there is no man that have resisted me amen she's using her body to attract men but she uses the body on the water on the portrait on the window anybody clear so far what kind of picture you posting on facebook you get your portrait look at the picture you're posting you think people are full are you there song of solomon chapter four okay behold you are water solomon they brought his bread to him everybody when they brought eve unto adam adam look from the sleeper adam say wow this is born of my bone this is flesh of my flesh if you notice adam never admire anything about the future of the body of evil amen you follow me but when they brought the wife of solomon to solomon now solomon sees the shoulda mad and solomon now is giving his expression just like adam salomon what pleases you on your wife you ready behold you are fair my love you are fair in other words you are beautiful you have water the first thing can i raise the top you keep that in mind the first thing that solomon sits on his wife is welcome everybody clear the first thing is the eyes in proverbs 6 you follow me you found me the scripture says last not after her beauty neither be that taken by what and that woman was a strange woman she was a bad woman when solomon sings the tsunami the first thing that cut solomon is the eyes and we know that a holla and a holly bar painted the water everybody following me everybody awake the tsunami woman does not have only eyes but her eyes is the eyes of a dove what does dove represent can you say it out everybody here solomon say be careful of a strange woman don't let her pick you up by her eyes eyes prophetic don't let her pick you up by eyes eyes prophetic jezebel a prophetess you follow me jezebel a prophetess isaac malachi for a prophet also isaac are you following me when he sees the woman the eyes called him solomon said be careful on the eyes of a woman everybody clear everybody clear when solomon looked at the tsunami the eyes cut him but he said no the eyes of the tournament are the eyes of a dove they are the eyes that have water hallelujah and each one you are looking your eye is the gate to your water so when solomon look at the eyes he's getting a preview of the soul of the tournament i wish i had time everybody follow me are we okay if you okay say amen praise god your eye is the gate to your soul you can look at it it's almost governed the other senses in other words the eyes dominate the other senses that's why when you blind into trouble everybody clear me clear you look at it before you taste before you taste something you already seen it you look at it before you smell you feel it and so forth it's usually the eye is the gate to the weapon and if you could only let that be a blessing to you when you see with your own eyes here with your own ear the lord jesus moving among the people and doing things that he has been doing it should have made you have real faith in other words you come to church they pray for somebody and he begin to walk automatically that seeing built faith to you ever clear in psalm chapter 74 david says this all delivered not the soul of thy water so brother david says that a christian have a soul of a dove and that soul is reflected in the world so when solomon sees the woman salomon first look and say wow she is a christian are you following me that's why solomon keeps saying my sister my love my sister my spouse first a sister damn a spouse you cannot get married to a woman that is not christian solomon look in the eyes and say she's a believer she have darvish hallelujah let's go to verse one behold you are thermal love beyond you are beautiful you have water dove eyes within that locks your veil your water the second thing solomon sees is hey we talked about hair right it's checking the head shape everybody clear your hair is as a flock of goat in other words when you take one goat you put another goat you put another goat you put another goat the hair off it shouldn't matter wavy at the opening of the seven seals the bible becoming you you ready are like a flock of goat that appear from mongilla amen these goats are not straight but they like a mountain but they're floating like this the hairs are wavy everybody clear do you love the bible can i continue can i continue okay number two your thief my time is running out your teeth are like the flock of sheep dada evenly what they are all straight teeth i'm reading the bible is your bible different than mine so you can have orthodontics works if you want to amen your different i like a flock of sheep which color are those sheep did i say anything whiter your teeth are like a flock of sheep that are even shown which came out from the water clean teeth sister not dirty one brush your teeth ever care even brother brush your teeth what everyone bear what and none is welcome what did solomon say i hope you'll be gracious with me in time anyway i gave you a quote solomon says that your teeth is like a ship because usually if you look at people's stiff they look like this right teeth look like this amen he says that the teeth of the shoulder mountain are like what they've been clean they washed they all look beautiful straightened and what else he says that the thief came up where of everyone bear what if you look at the operative usually i'm bigger that's right everybody remember but your loyalty for how when you put them together it looks like the apple have two babies make sense make sense now your teeth are like a flock of sheep white evenly shown which came up from the washing well off everyone bear water twins and none is what in other words she's not missing teeth am i reading a different bible am i reading a different bible [Music] oh my god another is barren among them verse 3 your what eyes belong to water hair belong to water teeth belong to water lip belong to water look where solomon is by just looking at the woman you're there your lip i like a thread of water she had rosy lip not from a make-up you ready and your speech your mouth is calmly your water your cheek ah like a piece of pomegranate within your locks a pomegranate is rosy in other words the shoulda mud have rosy cheeks cheeks belongs to who mouth belongs to who this is where solomon is keep going solomon verse four yo what now he left here salomon already finished here solomon is here everybody follow me we are on the window anybody clear your neck is like a tower of david anybody clear it's like the tower of david let me stop here and then build something keep your finger right there take song of solomon chapter six keep your finger right there jump to verse four if you're there you can say amen you are beautiful all my love as who as who system you appear again on this bible as tears calmly as who jerusalem terribly as an army with banner turn away your what solomon insisted on water turn away your eyes from me for they have done welcome and solomon in proverbs 6 say what watch the eyes of a strange woman because that power is coming from the ice you follow me and solomon says when i look at you what's overcoming me what is bringing me more closer to love you is that spirit that is in you are you there because the eyes are the eyes of a dove what is going on with the eyes brought upon him in question and answer somebody is teaching brother branham something brother venom comes and they were selling cows and when brother branham came he looked he said look at this cow he's big he's fat get him and the men look at brother brother he say you preacher you need to keep your preaching stuff behind i need to teach you something he said come over here this is cow business okay i need to teach you something what are you teaching brother branham he says now look at that calf down there we walk down there say see that word what in the world they thought brother branham they said when you look at the cow don't look at how beautiful a cow is check the eyes of that cow they said brother branham do you see that stare in the eyes that look at you like this because that stair tells you what is under i say yeah say her children the children of that cow and her grandchildren and her great great grandchildren will still have that same white white it is genetics [Music] mama had a struggle in the marriage watch out is coming to the kids that's why brother branham told that man he said if he's not born again don't let him marry because he's going to be held to this woman they shall run themselves poor can't keep money they shall never be a mother to their cows you never could fatten them they shall never make beef look at this calf here that is sold brother bran look how gentle she looks look that at that peaceful water it's in the face in the ice that kind of look no still in her eyes she shall be a real mummy to her calf to a calf calf and to the calf and calf will continue to be that way they shall all be they shall all of them be mummies if they can get the right kind of breeding the right kind of husband bull that bull to that calf she shall make her their children but that scary look in the face will always make a poor herd of caddo if a man is trying to buy cardo i say yes sir thank you they taught by the problem something and the same thing applied by water you understand why solomon say watch the eyes you take one of them painted face and water look like some kind of animal trying to disfugue herself from a human being she shall never make anything she shall run all the time christianity is not beauty on the water it is on the water solomon say the ice is the eyes of water reflecting the soul of the woman it's on the inside of a what does what dove adorned themselves in a peaceful quiet spirit dove which is a great place before god that is what we want to look for on what and on what and whoever look at the young men in the eyes you see him like this are you there and i said why you always look at that car in the face i said she looked all right good healthy cow said i want to tell you boy you got a lot to learn and i realized it after he told me and i don't care how she's made up she might be a beef plum to the hoof but if she got that wild stare in her face don't ever buy her why so jeff well say the first thing is she shall never stay put number two the next thing she shall never be a mummy to her calf they put her in a pen now the reason she is welcome she is fat because she's controlled by the law the message say don't do this the message say don't do this she's doing that because of the message that's why she looks good if you take the message off you're gonna see the first thing she start wearing paintings [Applause] everybody clear the reason she's fat you turn her loose take the message off where if that was there she shall run herself to water you know i kind of learned something i believe that applied to water the word sterile look better stay away from her boy all that there blew stuff over the top of her eyes a holy bar i would want that i don't think that is becoming to a christian i don't care how much the television and peppa say it's pretty it is the most horrible looking hidden side that i ever seen in my water everybody clear so far let's go back to proverbs chapter 4. i thought i'm gonna get too hidden let me see if i can hit this and we go amen we were on first four your water neck we right here now anybody clear your neck is like the tower of david built for an armory where on they hang a thousand buckler or sheet of water david solomon is saying that your neck is like a place the tower of david and the tower of david is a place they were coming and hanging stuff in other words it looks like your neck is a place where you can put her but in david tower they were putting thousands of necklaces so sister do you need to put thousands of necklaces hold off let's see what the scripture says and what brother branham says everybody clear let's go verse 5 your breasts are like too young rose she's a young woman that are twins which feed among the water solomon is here your breasts everybody clear everybody clear he's right here on the chest and the breast is what differentiate a woman grown from a man everybody clear so salomon is giving us that's a woman it is not a man i'm not marrying a man amen until the break did salomon say something about her belly did solomon say something about her hip did solomon say something about her legs did solomon say something about her feet solomon stopped at the poetry and jezebel gave jehu the portrait jezebel understood that the poetry is enough to make a man collapse follow me that's why your facebook doesn't do what they do by any chance they knew what they were doing you don't know what they were doing your whatsapp knew what they were loading your instagram studied these things by just this picture solomon is fired up he even forget about the other part jezebel didn't need to show their legs she just gave the poetry it's enough to draft the man crazy facebook whatsapp instagram amen now solomon just stopping here he is now reacting the window of jesus verse six until the daybreak and the shadow free will i will get me to the mountain of water may represent water may represent what death anybody clear come on verse 2 continue and to the heel of what frankincense brother benjamin when the three major came to worship jesus they brought how many things three what is the first one gold which type of what deity what was the second one what is the third one and frankie says means water in service priesthood they brought jesus gold deity mer and frankincense which was speaking that jesus was deity in service to die make sense make sense so when solomon sees that sudamat he got so enthused with this love until he was ready to die for the tournament he was ready to take a service and die for the tsunami and he says i must climb on a mountain i must clamp on a hill i must clamp on the mountain in service to death that's what jesus did for his bride he clamped on the mountain of gethsemane of golgotha doing service to die for his bride [Applause] next episode next session solomon was a type of christ looking at his bride and he seen his blood naturally beautiful he said you know what i'm gonna be in service to die to pay for your price of redemption i'm gonna claim the mountain that's why when he was going the hill he was still going he can't get because he needs to mind i have a bride i have a beautiful woman i must die for her i'm a deity in service frankie says mirror to die to redeem my brother amen watch the next verse verse seven you are all what my wanton there is what after redemption is done he pay your price then he's coming to get his bread with that spot or everybody okay everybody okay everybody okay but all that he took for christ was a poetry and jezebel understood if i just give a poetry not naturally but artificial one everybody clear everybody clear jump to verse 9. you are you have ravished my heart i can't take it anymore he have not even seen the heap because the woman is coming with a big gown makes sense not a tight ground it's coming okay all i've seen is here i can't take it anymore i'm ready to die for you amen you have ravaged my heart first name my what do you see that because she have dove's eyes you need the holy ghost man amen my sister my work you have harvest my heart with one of your water still his focus is what that spirit is more precious than everything else your eyes with one of your work brother robert jump on that one you ready have you seen it let's read it together verse nine you have ravaged my heart my sister my spouse you have ravished my heart with one of your eyes karma i want everybody to read this with one what i'm your water how many chances sister can have brother branham how many chains can we get the message is perfectly in line with the scripture brother branham should a christian woman wear what what as necklace water because they already told us that our neck is like the neck of the tower of david so we can load ourselves brother branama well sister i know this mean a lot to you and it means a lot for me for you to place your confidence i tell you the truth now remember the bible says when you water do not announce with costly jew we went to this and pearl and all kind of wearing jewelry but let that be the adorning of what the eyes the dove a quiet and a mixed spirit just coded which is a great press before the lord i don't mean that but i don't mean by that sister that if you had the pin and this is me not the water who said that in the bible the message is water with water if you had a pin that you want to wear or air hey how many how many little what that's your water how many necklaces did the tsunami have the message is perfectly in line with the scripture one that your husband gives you or maybe or something like that you will now to me i don't think that's bad did brother branham give you the scripture that is just me now remember i make myself clear that is my what did you find where or the prophet opinion came from is he the prophet opinion so you learn that when brother branham say my opinion you better open your eyes because it's a prophetic message amen but i think it's the approach to it it's the way you do it it's the motive behind it jezebel and when you see it getting a hold of you then do not leave the thing alone but i think i think if you would wear your wedding ring but a fig is as far as air how many if you go to water loading yourself up brother branham now he's talking about the tower of david that's not the tower of david you can't go loading yourself up sister if you got to loading yourself up you went through the 10th store down there with a magnet on you excuse that i didn't mean to say that like that but that is water it is not a tower of death it is like a tower of david but you don't load too much if your husband want to give you how many and it must be how everybody clear everybody clear what time is it i gotta stop i gotta let you go when god created adam he created adam by the spoken way adam pop up then adam was living and they found that it was not good for men to be water alone thank god now god put adam to sleep and when he put adam to sleep he pulled a rib and manufacture who who made evil who created eve why did the prophet say the devil designed her if i go i'm going to run more time i got to stop here amen because we were taught that the body of the woman was desired by who what does design mean amen who worked on the devil before who worked on eve before adam or satan god or satan what is that work mean amen the window of jezebel if i get into here you're going to go late let's stand [Applause] amen the window of jezebel jezebel looked at the window jezebel looking at the window a window can be a blessing an emergency a window can be a curse a window can open door to spirit a window can keep your spiritual life goes up a window needed a token if you can be in church be in church don't stay in the window there is two windows this one this portrait is bringing a man wanting to sacrifice his life for his wife amen it's a it's a portrait that when a man sees you when a man sees that dove eyes on you when when sees that christian character on you the man is ready to pay any prize like boaz just to get married to you if you have to work three job he's gonna work three jobs until i get that woman the man is ready to be a sacrifice to be in service to die for his brother he rather break his back at work as long as that woman is happy that's the portrait you want to give to the man but the portrait of jezebel is a portrait an exposition in the intent to cause a man to last and to control man by beauty by sex and by former all your marriage is holding on is only to sex and you gotta keep your husband with it you gotta keep your romantic stuff all the time to protect your husband instead of giving him a glance of that dove and salomon say he have overcome me i am ready to climb to the mountain of mirror i am ready to go to the hill of frankie says because of what i saw because you have ravished my water my heart not the head you have touched this that's it i have found gold brother poland [Laughter] [Applause] amen let's pray heavenly father lord we thank you again for your grace for your love and your mercy father lord we have expressed what you unfolded to us to your children father this my son type imagined that it's difficult but lord the devil is not sparing any if you just it was not for your grace we could have been slain father may you give the people a spirit of revelation for them to understand the real meaning behind this social media the real meaning to understand what is the key to the woman body why do we have to avoid these things what is the devil after in the woman what is it causing the world to go into what is really this jezebel spirit all around further bringing fashion bringing worldliness getting into our home opening the windows when we try to place our token but windows are open where spirits are oozing in and before you know it we cut we we we are catching our children doing things that are contrary to the message that we believe because somewhere a window was left open and a spirit entered and that spirit that enter is coming to destroy life to destroy our youth to destroy our wife to destroy our husband to destroy our marriage to destroy everything lord and the people can't even realize how that the devil has been working in a coming way trying lord father to destroy completely the spirituality on the bread of the lord jesus christ but lord may your mercy be granted unto us that you can give us an anointing of revelation to unfold these things lord father to your brother so that we can understand and get god further the concept of the message and understand that we are in the war and we must be watchful especially to the head of the house and understanding what is getting in the house and what is coming out lord father i commit this sermon unto the hand may you bless your children may you touch those
