TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] lord i believe all things are possible lord i believe [Music] lord i believe lord i believe all things are possible lord [Music] us is here amen jesus here all things are possible jesus [Music] hallelujah jesus is here all things are possible jesus do you believe it this morning blessed be the name of the lord i hope you're not cl you're not clapping your hand for me you clapping to the amen blessed be the name of the lord we appreciate you thank you very much musician god richly bless you that will be all with the music brother mike thank you very much if you need some exhortation sometime you sit beside brother mike he will exhort you pretty good in the scripture amen that's what we like people who knows their bible amen blessed be the name of the lord we greet you all in the name of jesus christ and if there is any family member here we don't call people visitor god richly bless you amen you already heard about sister rosemary so keep the family in prayer by god's grace she's going for couple weeks and if everything goes well i believe next saturday will be the burial so just make sure we keep them in prayer so god can give them safe travel mercy and they can come back here good amen we know what happened after death so we should be calm now we know the mystery he only take the hou the the rapture the coming of the lord and that will solve everything one to be with the lord one enter into the world my sister-in-law had a baby yesterday so everything working fine amen blessed be the name of the lord i believe the young brother received the message about the youth brothers young brothers meeting coming up did you receive the message somebody said no did you receive it somebody here says no make sure your number is connected to the church directory so you can receive the message so lord's willing we meet here on saturday at six o'clock amen i have not received any question yet it looks like everybody knows everything [Laughter] i have not received any questions yet so i'm just assuming are you waiting for that day to give me your question and i'm to have 10 questions in one time so you better do it a little bit earlier and send it to me so we can see what is going on in your mind that you want to talk privately and we can talk to you as a pastor as a friend as a big brother as a family member so nobody is in the court or in a trial like somebody will see me like oh i'm still struggling with this i'm not going to tell anybody oh no way you keep it you're going to blow up yourself amen everybody up to date we're good yeah brother john mentioned something about the music here all we want to do is make sure everything is in perfect order amen we encourage you to sing but some of the time you need parent or you need somebody a little bit mature to check the music and to make sure the source are good amen when i pray when we preach here by the high heel we're not preaching high heel to you only somebody's laughing already we're preaching high heel first to show you what is the spirit behind high heel so when you understand the spirit behind high heel if you're doing it you need to stop and not only that but you get also discernment of the sermon that you get so when you're looking at the christian singer you can look at the picture only that they're putting on the album when you just look at the picture if you see them wearing long high heels long nail like this makeup all these kind of stuff all of those should be giving you signal of the life behind the singer the word might be good but what is the life behind the singer amen somebody who took a picture body part hanging out or things like that automatically your discernment by the word should pop up and say something is wrong right here amen so when we preach about how long your dress should be your skirt and everything if you're still struggling with those things i'm not gonna stop i will preach it until we go to the rapture until everybody stop wearing it amen you can keep doing it i'm not going to stop too so if you want me to move to deeper ground you stop what you're doing so we keep climbing higher amen in other words brother branham said the difference between paul and the pentecostal preacher he said paul when he preaches one he will stay with him until that person received the holy spirit so it's not just preaching and we go no because i will be surprised you see this is why you see people 25 years in the message and no changes because the sermon get here and out what is the next what is the next that's not the case when the sermon comes it's the lord bringing his grace to judge not you but to judge the stuff that you're struggling in life so you need to stop and examine yourself what am i doing am i doing what has been preached what can i correct here then you correct it and once you correct it you are growing into the lord but we cannot preach a high heel and we preach this and we preach this and we preach and you're still struggling with something down there so it means your experience is not quite correct we need to go back to ground zero let's go back to the altar and make sure you have the holy spirit amen if not you're gonna leave this church right here and before you know it you start wearing paints it shows that you never believed before don't tell me you were believing before no no the holy spirit you can't stay in one place you always want to move and move and move and grow so what we're preaching to you need to go in your heart and he needs to change you so you need to look and lash here when we started here in this church where was i at where am i at today if you're not changing something is wrong if they preach about makeup five five months and you're still doing the same thing something is wrong don't fool yourself because i receive messages what you're putting on facebook i receive them was it yesterday somebody sent me something and if you look at what people are posting you wonder if they were even born again be leaving the message for years and put it up right there on social media before you put something stop and think not think about what is going to please brother stephen no pre to think about the word that was being preached here what i'm putting up here is he honoring me is he honoring my father is he honoring mama is he bringing respect to my family is he bringing respect to my church is he bringing respect to my personality that's what you need to look at you're not there to entertain people i told you i'm not going to stop you not dare you not here in this world to entertain people the people don't sit in their home trying to entertain you why are you the one entertaining them you buy a new car you have to post it why do they post their car why you keep doing it what is wrong what are you seeking for what are you looking for why you can't go two days without posting something why don't you post things that are edifying people because david used the same sword of goliath and kill him with it why don't you post something like maybe what brother branham say what the words say something that somebody opened and see versus your face we already seen you a lot that's your pastor right so don't make him fall out of yourself up there respect yourself we know you we're good you're beautiful all of that we already know you're beautiful you super you the head of everybody no woman look like you we already know about it give us some good news ouch ah you got quite a pastor let's go to genesis chapter 15 you hate me no problem i pray for you in heaven you will be hugging me thank you so much say after a lot of headaches if you study languages you'll be afraid what you're doing somebody can just look at you and understand a lot of stuff and you think you're fooling them and when they want to get married somebody said not that one they won't tell you go to that one and you keep seeing people using when they see you they exit and they see you they exit why are everybody exiting when you see me watch what you're doing get all the foolishness out amen and somebody look and say i've never seen her she's different i've never seen her behaving like this then somebody's interested on what makes her different then you attracted somebody because your life is pulling amen don't copy after the world so when you look at album you look at the singer look at the singer before you go to the word stop the word look at them look at how they dress what are they trying to do are they trying to dance are they trying to copy a rock-and-roll move or a hip-hop move what are they doing is the singer projecting himself or is the singer really worshipping god when you begin to look at things like that you can detect something say yes because you go to hell there is a lot of people with beautiful voices in hell a lot of them brother brother i'm saying holy would enter the church through singers amen so you hear the word for you first apply it to your life then that word became also a filter to help you detect the devil where it's going on amen but don't just copy and put it up here copy and put it up here you'll be tired my friend you'll be tired anyway we're gonna have some time to talk together with the sister with the brother so we can talk more clear amen blessed be the name of the lord genesis chapter 15 verse five everybody up to date with the sermon amen okay you lag behind it's not my fault if you're there you can say amen lord help us hallelujah verse 5 and he brought him forth abroad god told abraham come out and say look now toward heaven and tell the stars if you'll be able to number them and he said to him so shall your seed be you might be seated so you know the story you know the background god was talking to abraham he say abraham i am your shield i am your great you see the great reward abraham look at him he say okay you're blessing me you're doing all these things but i don't have a child god said come up here let's go outside look over there can you number the start no that's the way your seed is gonna be amen so in other words god gave abraham a promise ready anybody clear now what did abraham do when god gave him a promise verse 6 and he did what he believed in the lord and he counted it god counted it to him for water so in genesis chapter 15 the scripture is talking about the faith of abraham toward god the element that is brought here is abraham believed amen by believing god pull his seal and say you were righteous just believing they didn't say abraham did this this no just by believing god pull up the seal and say abraham be righteous amen let's go to genesis chapter 17 believing faith righteousness now genesis 17 we talk about it god told abraham hey walk before me and be what perfect everybody clear verse 1 and when abraham was 90 years old and 9 99 the lord appeared to abram and said to him i am the almighty god walk before me and be there you understand that now and i will make because perfection you must watch your word right watch your mouth and i will make my covenant between me and you and will multiply you exceedingly and abraham fell on his face and god talked with him saying as for me behold my covenant is with you and you shall be a father of many nations everybody so far verse 5 neither your name anymore be called abraham but your name shall be abraham for a father of many nations have i made you in genesis 15 he said look at your children without numbers now in genesis 17 he said a father of many nations all we know is abraham did what he just believed god how did abraham believe how so he just said accepted how did he believe let's go to romans chapter four at the opening of the seventh seal the bible became a new book let's go to genesis roman four i'm sorry verse 17 because we we usually repeat things and abraham believe god and abra stop stop slow down how did abraham believe [Music] because in the old testament they never talk about janice and chambers they only say the magician how many four three eight we don't know it took paul in the new testament to enter the old testament and say there were two and their name are janice and james you can go all around the old testament you don't know what the name are not so now when you take paul and when you take moses you put them together now you begin to see a clear picture if you only take moses you will say there were magicians that we stood moses that's all you can talk but when you take paul your story changed you would say there were two magicians that withstood moses and their name are janice and generous now the story is different in the old testament moses said abraham went and give that to melchizedek that's all you know but when you take paul you say not only abraham gave time liver who was in the launch of abraham also gave that then something else open up now you understand more now oh now understand why delivered we're giving the priesthood now understand what now everything begin to get clear about here so romans chapter 4 verse 17 as it is written i have made you a father of many that's genesis 17. anybody clear now before him whom he did what that's genesis 15. everybody clear it's a surgery of the scripture even who god who makes a laughter dead so abraham didn't believe just god because god is a no an object of worship abraham believe a god that quickened the dead am i reading a different bible the bible says that before him whom he believes even who god what kind of god did you believe [Music] you believe god which god a god that we pure a god that strikes you a god there is many attributes in god what kind of god are you believing the bible says now even god come out who is giving you an explanation of that god a god who makes a love there in other words abraham believed the god of resurrection not just a god but a god of resurrection a god that can take something that is dead and bring it back again to life a god that can take a heart that is dead with a heart attack and quicken the heart again a god that can take a brain that was dead and quicken that brain again a god that can take a man who had a stroke and quickened down men and that men receive life again [Applause] a god that you can cut somebody else's ear and amputate somebody and he pick up the ear and put it back again and everything works without a scar that is the god abraham believe in not just god a specific god [Applause] hallelujah even god who makes a love there dead indeed what now abraham calls those things which be not as though there so here in genesis 15 abraham all they say is he just believed they didn't tell us what abraham did in reaction to what he believed but now paul begin to give us more insight that when they told abraham abraham never stopped quiet he didn't just believe and that's it but when abraham believed he begin to call [Music] so here it saw it's not only faith but in roman we're talking now about abraham's confession now we begin to get the picture abraham believe god okay that same how did he believe god [Music] how how abraham didn't stay quiet when god told abraham something abraham open his mouth [Music] amen hallelujah and call those things which be not as though there so even if something doesn't exist abraham can look and say i believe there is a flower here then tomorrow you see abraham you say i still believe there is a flower here where is the flower i don't see who brought the flower i don't see did somebody give you a flower no all i believe there is a flower here hallelujah verse 18 who against water when they say against hope brother one i'm saying it means there was not even hope sometimes we have hope you look at the situation i'm stuck here but i know if i go see the pastor he can help me that's a hope i know i don't have food but if i go see sister edie she said he would give me food that's hope but abraham that was not even an option there was not an option that i can go to the bank and apply and get a loan and solve that it was no hope zero against hope zero hey marquee against hope believe in water which hope was he believing on because there was no hope amen that he might become the father of many nations according to that which was spoken so shall your seed be that was genesis 15. in genesis 15 this is how your seed will be genesis 17 father of many nations paul is now mixing the two genesis okay he's taking genesis 15 and 17 and he's mixing it anybody clear verse 19 and being not weak in water in faith he considered not his own body now dead so now you understand why there was no hope for him because his body was dead that's why he have to believe in the god of resurrection [Music] everybody clear when he was about a hundred years old about a hundred because the scripture said nandina everybody here neither yet the deadness of sarah's water so sarah dead abraham dead when you approach a god when you're dead you must pull a certain attribute from that god i want to face you as a god of resurrection because something is in me is dead if it's financial struggle i want to approach you as the son of prosperity oh my god verse 20 he staggered not at the promise of god true unbelief but was strong in water doing water giving glory to her so when abraham received the promise he had challenges and back here his own body was his enemy when he woke up in the morning his body was reminding him that you are old when he looked at his wife his wife's body was reminding abraham that you are old you cannot have a child but abraham did not look at that [Music] [Applause] anybody here abraham was rising up in the morning giving glory to god [Music] when they say he staggered not at the promise of god the way we are trained we if they bring abraham today all of you will say wow father abraham you're a superman so god told you something you just believe like this ah how did you do it that's not the way it is amen when they told you moses was speaking you would look at moses maybe when you go to heaven you'll fall down you say moses it's you oh my god what a man brother branham said in perfect world strength he said we are very grateful that we still have a kind heavenly father who looks over our our mistake and does not welcome them to us okay let me continue i was reading over in the book of romander is that what we're reading the fourth chapter where paul writes the divine commentary of the life of whom now we know that abraham many times got kind of frustrated like we do so when you meet abraham don't think he was a superman [Music] everybody but when his commentary was written there was not any of the frustration mentioned you see never mention them at all [Applause] what i'm trying to make you understand is if sometimes you get weak in faith it's okay [Music] if sometimes you get discouraged that's normal [Laughter] abraham scattered not at the promise of god through water by was strong giving water so brother branham is using that scripture and he says if you look at this scripture you won't understand something this portion of the scripture was hiding the weaknesses of abraham so when abraham woke up one day and said waiting for the time i will have that promise paul took that and put it there say what else did abraham say what does did abraham say maybe they make fun of him and he say lord i still believe you but remember me abraham took paul took that say what else so when paul presents you you think oh stronger abraham every day in the morning he was like i still believe god i still believe your brother brother i'm saying relax okay those stuff were [Music] everybody clear see that is the way i hope mine will be rolled up there is not my water and everything but just what i tried to water the water intention of my water when god judges you he look in your heart you can get weak in the body but as long as your heart is keep saying father i am weak but i still believe god will take that one and wipe everything away [Applause] hallelujah so when you get discouraged that's normal but keep your heart right you say he hurt father he hurt but i still believe that you hear me when you do that god take a hurt and erase it [Applause] and when you ask god what did brother said say he said bother said say i still believe you oh i heard him say he hurt no he said i still believe you [Applause] [Laughter] hallelujah but just what i tried to do the what intention of my heart to do for god's water that's why james said elias was a man subject to water he was just a normal man brother branham said what it means he has his up and down where did they put it we always look at elijah boom may fire fall hallelujah and he prayed earnestly that he might not reign and he ran not on the earth by the space of three years and six months he was a human just like you amen but amazing grace look at things in a different realm amen please be the name of the lord let's go back again where we were verse 20. he staggered not at the promise of god through unbelief that was water the disposition of the heart anybody clear sometimes he woke up in the morning he hurt but that's not what god is looking at amen giving glory to him so we found here that with his confession he calls things to existence everybody here that were not there and then he was giving glory to god for something that is not even there hey buddy amen verse 21 and being fully persuaded brother john paul was singing this morning being fully persuaded that what he god had promised he was able also to do water you ready now watch verse 22. and therefore in other words this is why in other words for this reason for this kind of behavior for everything that i have just explained you because of what he did that i just give you more detail this is the reason why and therefore he was water to him for water you see now in genesis 15 they just say faith he believed god and he was imputed for him for righteousness we stuck but in roman paul is saying before paul said he was imputed to him paul described to us the behavior of abraham when god gave him the promise he was calling the things he was confessing god this is what he did he didn't look at the circumstances because of all of that this is why he was imputed him for righteousness in other words paul is telling you abraham didn't just believe like that the reason why god bring the seal and put it on him it was not just faith but he was faith with action [Music] that was action where he is confession we okay now so today when they say it was imputed unto him now you understand what it means everybody clear verse 23 now he was now written for his sake alone now that was example we wrote it in a bible but i'm just trying to tell you don't stop at abraham because now you understand he was a man just like you okay this didn't stop at him amen [Music] that he was imputed to him verse 24 but for who as also to whom it shall be water so that behavior of god was not only toward abraham but if you do the same thing abraham did you have the same right as abraham royal seed for god to look at you as a righteous anybody here if we do what believe on him that deed water remember what kind of god did abraham believe paul is saying if you also believe in the god of water you see now if we believe on him that raise up jesus our lord from there if abraham believes in the god of resurrection and he behaved this way if you also believe on the god of resurrection then god is obligated i'm saying that clearly god is obligated amen you don't say amen because you don't know who you are we preach to you your origin who here when he get in his parent home he got scared when you get home do you get scared why are you not scared try to go in somebody else's house when you are not invited when you are not expected you have to go this way but if it's in your parents house you enter there you switch the light because you know who you are it is home [Applause] amen so the scripture is teaching you here to begin to behave like in your parent home so when you enter god that's why paul said we have boldness we're not afraid when we're approaching god we're approaching god with boldness with confidence i am not talking to somebody who want to kill me i am talking to somebody who will never kill me [Music] if he killed me he killed himself [Music] let's go to james chapter two don't worry we'll continue to loosen those feathers and remove them and pack them up up up and burn them up how can jonah get mad at god that was the old testament god save somebody and jonah get mad am i reading a different bible and god has asked him he said are you sure you are rightfully to be mad jonah say yes he said this plant was waste here he was giving me i have rightful how can you talk to god like that [Music] do you know what the scripture called abraham he was a what a friend of god how do you talk to your friend do you come you say what a better man how you doing i'm doing okay that's how you talk to your friend do you call him benjamin you sometimes say hey come on man because he's your friend right and abraham was talking to god like a friend when god comes he says sit down there abraham let's go say how was your day today that was fun so what you're trying to do in sodom over there ah yeah i cannot hide you you know you're my buddy i'm going to sodom i'm going to destroy sodom wait a minute you're going to the show sodom you know my family this evening right yes uh okay so if you don't find 50. oh if i found 50 okay abraham you know your body i can make you a favor i will spare him okay let's go 40. like the discussing the price when i tell you this your mind your humanity is fighting me oh holy god that's the angel i am not an angel [Applause] brother branham say a son of god have more right than angel those angels never sin they don't understand when i'm sick when i sing redemption amazing grace they don't know what i'm talking about the only one who understands amazing grace is my father because he came down and he become the high priest that can be touched by the feeling of my infirmity when i say headache jesus understand headache gabriel said father what is head that jesus said i know i was there i got one one day when i was preaching in galilee the sun was too hot it hit me i understand what they're talking about [Applause] [Laughter] genesis 17. you understand these things you won't have blood pressure if you understand these things you won't have high blood pressure [Music] if you understand god just obey what god does even though the desire is still there you say because you say i'm taking these shoes i'm putting that off that's all let that desire god will handle it [Music] did you put that desire there you were born with it how are you going to remove it oh you're going to say desire desire come up come on come on come on ah now it's coming up it's here now it's here you see how you try to create force a christian life james chapter two you're the one taking my time seventeen even so faith if he has not water now it's a third element in genesis 15 fifth in roman confession now james say works jesus said faith of abraham roman not only faith there was faith coupled with confession now james say not only faith and confession there is something else amen even so faith if he has not worked it is being water so you cannot have faith and faith is lingering amen yeah a man may say you have faith and i have work both of those extremities a problem amen show me your faith without your work and i will show you my faith by ma you believe that there is one god you do well the devil also believe and tremble so by faith what is the difference between you and the devil because if the devil does what faith say they will be converted [Laughter] verse 20 but will you know oh venman that faith without without work is dead was not who uh i thought paul you already finished with abraham james why do you want to talk about abraham paul already said it was not abraham our father justified by what i thought he was justified by faith i thought he was justified because he was doing confession giving glory to god and calling things to existence now james say he was justified by which which one is now [Music] you see how it works faith will trigger this one and this one will trigger this one it's like a cascade anybody was not abraham our father justified by water by work somebody's sleeping by works or if not i need to give somebody a microphone i can't preach in the quiet oddity everybody here but i'm saying he makes and eventually sick when he offered isaac his son upon the water see you see you have faith wrought in other words working with his water and by words was faith-made water so faith is made perfect or is made complete by water so if you just have faith it is just at the beginning that faith needs to jump stages and for that faith to be finished you must bring works if works is not there your faith is not complete yet amen amen hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah and the scripture was fulfilled which said abraham water believed god and he was water i thought paul already explained that abraham believed god and he was imputed to him for righteousness and he was called the water now james said it was works that justify him that made him complete and after that he was imputed unto him for in here faith righteousness paul said it was confession also righteousness james say confession faith then works then you complete in other words james close the circle of faith the beginning of faith the author and the finisher offer your faith then it's it's confession then when he gets to work james say you finish anybody clear verse 24 you see then amen you see then how that by works a man is water and not by faith only so james is telling you you cannot just have faith if you just have faith you cannot be justified [Music] that's what we thought before james is telling you your faith must be or must go all the way to works then you are justified and paul say not only works you must also confess to be justified so to be really justified we must have faith confession and works anybody here likewise also was it was not rahab they are not justified by water if you got to the book of hebrew herab was justified by what by faith hebrew 11. you see now by faith she said we heard and everybody scared but james said she didn't stop there she took a risk when the spies came she brought this prize he was showing that truly she really believed everybody clear when she had received the messenger and had sent them out another way for us the body without the spirit is dead so faith without work is welcome so if you have a faith that you never put in action it is air [Music] how many dead faith do we have now let's pray heavenly father lord we thank you for your grace your love your mercy and for everything you have been doing for us father we are committing ourself again unto the hand and we commit this service unto the hand be the alpha and the omega lord we have done what every human being that you are giving ability can do now it's up to you to take this word lord to unfold it and bless your children heal them lord father and give them what they need in jesus precious name amen give me grace so we can unload this thing anybody clear now we spoke about the tongue and hair we talk about the tongue and the heart we talk about the tongue and the power we talk about the tongue we started last week and work today we're going to talk about the tongue and confess everybody i pray god i can reach where i'm going lord help me blessed be the name of the lord let me see if i need to be here this computer at this time you're wasting your time devil okay let me go back this way one okay he's

no no you're going farther all right praise be the name of the lord okay let's see how he works there praise be the name of the lord okay we talked yeah last week about men and the three realms that man leaves brother branham said that god when he made man in the beginning he made him superior to anything on earth he gave him the jurisdiction of everything on earth to control water everything he controlled the animal life he controlled the fire life remember last sunday the fish is of the sea he controls the wind he controls the plant life he control everything that's what man is up everybody clear so far brother branham continued he said man was made as a secondary god on earth he was given the power to control all things all element of the earth that was who adam adam was given these great powers but then the power that was given to mank to make himself is where he fell and adam could speak to the wind and he would stop he could speak to the trees and they would obey him he could speak to the wildlife the tongue and he will obey him he could speak to the waters tongue ever what it is everything obeyed adam because that is the position god made man now that is the beginning of man that is what god give him power over everything on the earth though they fall he lost through the fall he lost the power then he became unconscious of the fact after losing his relationship and water but to abraham abraham became the friend of god anybody here fellowship with the father then he lost that and all of his great channels become clogged up and he could not get through not what adam was in god christ has redeemed us back to water now a redeemer to redeem many things is to bring it back to its origin again how many believe you redeem man why are we not using our tongue amen amen we found out last sunday that men operate under three elements brother branham said the first element was humanistic and we explained it to you that it was a carnal the second one it was the divine revelation of faith the third one was vision or what we call that save the lord which is perfect everybody so far the corner we explained to you that it was working with the brain and the top of it was the eye then the divine faith or divine revelation of faith was coming from the heart that's why i ask you if everybody is on board with the sermon and the vision take the brain and the heart and couple them together everybody cares so far so under carnal humanistic it works with the visible element the other one is a divine which is the supernatural the third one take both of them the supernatural and the visual and put them back together everybody clear now in here we have the five senses of the body under divine revelation we have the five senses of the supernatural ever here but now we were dealing with the vision brother branham said but all these impressions we must not take them and say that save the lord buckle up pretty good because we're going somewhere we must not do that i'm talking about the vision we must have a direct voice an answer from god before we can say it is god not an impression not a sensation no matter how much it is proceeding now you got to be very careful here because the realm of faith uses those things brother branham says when you get to the corner mind first the corner mind can give you an impression hey mark here you look at something you say huh you look good sometimes it doesn't look good the corner man can give you a sensation anybody care and the colonel man can also give you a post of something ever here when you move from the corner mind to the divine revelation faith also does that they cannot have knowledge here faith also have knowledge but it's just a different kind of knowledge this is a knowledge intellectual this is a knowledge by revelation or godly knowledge about here faith also will give you an impression faith also can give you a sensation and faith also can give you a procession the difference is this one operate by the brain but this one operates by the heart everybody here so far and brother problem says that not an impression not a sensation no matter how much it is proceeding you must say i believe it could be this way when you say it could be that is hope everybody here there is a hesitation here anybody care but faith there is no hesitation it is solid and it is positive about here but when you get to vision this is what brother branham is talking about now you go to a higher rate right back here brother problem said but when you speak that safe the lord about here it is not you watch on the platform have you ever seen it fail that self the lord is water that's their highest reign never has failed and as long as it is that save the lord he can fail that is the realm of the vision brother branham continues here he said you be sure that god says that now and not an impression as i said the other night there is too many gimmicks in pentecost pentecostal people that is the reason the sincerity and the confidence has been lost because they were presuming on things they take up something and say that self the lord when he was not that saved the lord then he failed then they get discouraged everybody amen because of carnal impersonation if we were sure that was god we set still everybody here so when we say that self the lord you be sure that it's god not your honor or impression or possession everybody know that it is god and then in this case he spoke back to her and told her perfectly normal been that way ever since that's why jesus said i do nothing except the father shows me first everybody clear so far blessed be the name of the lord when we say that you need to move from a corner into the faithframe and into the vision it is not something that is extraordinary god can never ask you to do something when he have not seen in you the ability to do it anybody here so far when god asks you to do something you are able automatically to do it [Music] paul cell present i called myself to have i can't not myself to have apprehended but this one thing i do forgetting those things which are water and reaching forth unto those things which are water even paul in his christian experience always was longing to clamp higher with god ever here i pressed toward the mark for the price of a high calling of god in christ jesus brother explained this he said i like paul saying those things paul never was a person that liked to stay too long in one place anybody here so if paul was living under carnal impersonation paul moved on to faith but he didn't want to stay in faith paul wanted to move always higher hey but here brother branham say i like paul paul never was a person that liked to stay too long in one place he liked to move on deeper one time in a scripture he said for i forgetting those things which are in past i pressed toward the mark of a high calling see he kept pressing on he said now forgetting the principles of the doctrine of christ who he was what he was let us go into water about here blessed be the name of the lord is coming now in acts 22 verse 3 and 6 paul says this he says i am verily a man which i am a jew born in texas a city of silesia yet brought up in this city at the feet of gamaliel and taught according to the perfect manner of the law of the fathers and was zealous toward god as we all are this day paul says that i was a religious man i knew the law back and forth i was taught right but despite everything that i did i was living under a humanistic in other words paul was a religious humanistic man we have a bunch of them in the message everybody created so far he said i persecuted this way unto death meaning he was not under revelation that's why he was against the god binding and delivering into prison both men and women as also the high priests do bear me witness and all the instead of the elders from whom i also receive letters unto the brethren and went to damascus to bring them which were there banned unto jerusalem for to be what punished a man living under humanistic and religion can do things like that attacking the vindicated word of the hour thinking he's doing a service to god that his son that that man is under humanistic and he came to pass that as a magma journey and was come nigh on to damascus about noon suddenly they're shown from heaven a great light round about me what else does experience do to paul the bible says paul continued he said my manner of life from my youth which was at first among my own nation at jerusalem know all the jews everybody knew me which knew me from the beginning if they would testify the people that knew me that after the most straightest set off our religion i live a pharisee when you look at paul perfect in the law nothing to condemn him yet humanistic anybody clear one two o king agrippa i was not disobedient unto the heavenly water now poor one god pick him up god pick him up from this realm all the way here everybody what did the vision of god do to the life of power ever here paul said in philippians 3 but what things were given to me look at the power of vision those are counted lost for who these ramps when you get into these ramps you don't have to do anything watch god move you from this place and god bless you here all you have to do is relax god will take care of everything outside blessed be the name of the lord he said yeah doubtless and i counted all things but lost for the excellency of the knowledge of christ jesus my lord for whom i have suffered the loss of water one vision cut everything out ever here and do cut damn water that i may win who one vision in second corinthians 12 1 paul said it is not expedient for me that leads to glory i will come to water and to water paul is now telling you this is where i'm living now i'm living in visions and in revelation that is the realm i'm operating now hey but here i'm no longer in the humanistic realm amen let's go to first corinthians chapter 2 blessed be the name of the lord if you dare you can say amen fifth corinthians chapter 2 paul says this in verse 1 paul says and i present when i came to you came not with excellency of water all of what i'm not coming anymore to preach on the humanistic level make sense amen declaring to you the testimony of who no more humanistic ever here job two verse four and my speech and my preaching was not with entrancing words of man water i'm no more operating in humanistic level about here but in the demonstration of the spirit and of water i am now living in a different room why paul verse 5 that's your faith everybody should not stand in the wisdom of men i was there i persecuted the church i thought i was doing right but i was against the message of the hour now god who is reaching mercy rescue me and i'm coming to you not bringing again that foolishness because that's what makes me do things against god about here but that your faith should not stand in the wisdom of god but in the power of god however we speak wisdom among them that are perfect in christ yet not the wisdom of this world humanistic nor of the presence of this world humanistic there come to what nothing but we speak the wisdom of god in a mystery even the hidden wisdom which god ordained before the word to our glory which none of the princes of this world knew forehead they know it they would not have done what else the reason they crucified the lord they were living under humanistic and paul living under humanistic was crucifying jesus christ that's why when jesus met him he said paul pal why do you persecute me everybody cares so far but as it is written i has not seen nor he heard neither have entered into the heart of man the things which god has prepared for them that love him how do we get them first hand but god has done water revealed them to us by his water paul is going to the faithful room again revelation ever here by the spirit for the spirit searches all things yeah the deep things of god for what man knows the things of a man save the spirit of man which is in him even so the things of god knows no man humanistic but the spirit of god revelation now we have received not the spirit of the world but the spirit which is of god that we might know the things that are freely given to us of god which thinks also we speak not in the words he insisted which meant wisdom teaches but which the holy ghost teaches comparing spiritual things with spiritual everybody here verse 14 but the natural men receive not the things of the spirit for their water neither can he know them because they are spiritually discerned not the natural man by the spiritual man everybody clear so far blessed be the name of the lord paul says here in ephesians as he is not cease not to give thanks for you making mention of you in my prayer paul is praying for the center paul why what are you telling god in your prayer ever here that the god of our lord jesus christ the father of glory may give you the spirit of water and of water in the knowledge of water paul his prayer to the christian was god keep them right here everybody keep them ready and the revelation why because the eye of your understanding being enlightened remember that's i that he may know what is the hope of his calling and what is the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the water and what is the exceeding greatness of his power to others who believe according to the working of his mighty water paul says that i'm praying that christians stay here and make their growing revelation to understand the power that god have put into their own benefit everybody here so far blessed be the name of the lord we took those three elements we put them together humanistic this way divine revelation this way the vision in the middle and we talked about the dream last time amen and we found out that dream was the vision of the night now concluding with the dream brother branham says this he said dream are not an assurance every dream is not from god now there is many people that has dreamed and they have all kind of dream and you go to bed at night and eat a big supper and go to bed and you might dream anything so when you dream things make sure you didn't eat too much hey but here you might have a fever and you might have all kind of nightmare and so forth that is not god but yet god does deal with people through ever clear now the next was how god dealt with the people through dream in the days of joseph did you notice a dream is secondary it's a secondary way of god working some people can have dream don't mean nothing you can eat too much and have nightmares i love the prophet the bible says in ecclesiastical for dream cometh through the multitude of business when you so busy your mind is so preoccupied if what you have in your mind stuck too much there when you enter into rest in your heart you can pull that with you and have a dream that's why it's hard when you already love the man by sight to decide because you can take that image and jump into it and you think it's a revelation to me again did you hear me again you already love the man and you begin to pull that inna and when you wake up you say i dream he was bringing me a flower you already fell in love is it okay and after 10 years that was not my husband but i thought you told me you have a vision that he was your husband it was infatuation amen and through the test of time is going to bust everybody a dream is secondary something off to one side because people can have dreams that are not right that is not right but there was no prophet in the land in that day there was no prophet therefore god had to use what he has to use with and teaches us that god can use every faculty and everything that we do if it is consecrated to him but he first must be consecrated let your meditation remember king nebuchadnezzar which will reflect your water so before you go to bed watch what you're meditating on everybody here you can carry that to your dream everybody clear because it's your subconscious if you watch a dream you shall see that it's something that you have been thinking of or something like that usually you see and let your mind be on god see then so he reflects something from who and whatever you are let it reflect him but pranam is saying if you go to bed and you're thinking about god you're thinking about god you're pulling god closer to you that's what king nebuchadnezzar do and when you enter into your subconscious then god comes and speaks to your subconscious but if you are thinking about something else you can carry that also in your subconscious but it's not coming from god ever clear so now you need to know how to discern what a newborn see he never had any interpretation the dream was not in symbol it was right straight don't fear to take mary your mouth that wife and that which is conceived in here is of the holy ghost there was no prophet to give the interpretation so he had to come right straight like that god from god to joseph and god take a god taking that second early way what does it teach us right here before we we hit our text here is what he teaches us that god can use every faculty of our being if it's surrendered to him he can use your mind our dreams our subconscious our first conscience our our our everything that we have can be used of god if it is committed to everything that you are committed to god he shall use every outlet every part of you he shall use it because god created men to be a god no matter what it is he shall use it if it's sanctified to his purpose and calling everybody here so far blessed be the name of the lord now in damn days they had no prophet they had not had a prophet 400 years and so god dealt with him in a dream a dream is a secondary way the right way is always to do you remember always if there is no dream if there is no vision if there is no revelation you have a right as a believer to go back to the world and stay ready so if there is no dream you can stand with the world no vision you can stay with the world so don't be intimidating if somebody have a gift of vision and you don't have it they can operate through their gift and sometimes they can even go to hell but as long as you stay with the world even though you don't have vision if there is no impression if there is nothing the word of god will stand you forever [Applause] judah was gifted he went to hell amen have we not prophesied in your name have we not cast our devil in him and jesus said i never even knew you everybody here the word is the ground level you can see vision read your bible listen to the word because that gives you the grand level but here now god has has a way of proving whether his word is right or not everybody so far so this side gives you hope and the other side gives you faith about here now let's dig deeper into this blessed be the name of the lord i hope this computer will work here please be the name of the lord because this is where the course stuff is where the good good good stuff are amen blessed be the name of the lord hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord the devil knows what he's fighting but too late it's already working amen blessed be the name of the lord give me a minute and we go through this amen let's see go ahead and escape my brother hit escape i'm not gonna give up amen let's see what he comes up with blessed be the name of the lord so if there is no vision there is no prophecy there is nothing you have a ground to go through you go by the word of god you doom the devil that's it the bible says in matthew here that one day they lift you up buckle up pretty good take no water how you shall water who delivered you who did it yourself who did it if you look there there is two words here take no water god doesn't want you think anybody care take no thought or how you shall do what there is a thinking and speaking about here when you go through a situation do you hear me do you hear me that is pressing on you do you hear me that situation is pushing you to do two things do you follow me that situation it is the devil who wants you to use your brain everybody here and it is the devil who wants you to use your brain and to speak by your brain everybody when the devil oppresses you it means you are no longer living under humanistic because the first level is humanistic the second level is faith the third level is vision when you are here the devil sees you everywhere you going you are under his weather do you follow me so when you move from this place and you are living here are you there the devil bring trial in your life do you follow me the reason he's putting pressure he wants you to live faith and to come back here do you follow me we want you to stop thinking and speaking like a carnal mind because when you speak like a corner man you begin to drop down life and death is in the power of your tongue you begin to lower down what do you think about the economy oh the economy is bad it's so bad i don't know what's going on i don't know what's going on i don't know what's going to come in this world i'm afraid about my job yeah we too we are slow we're going too slow you begin to adopt a language amen you begin to adopt a language and you don't see that you're going down you're going down why before that person come you are probably thinking about the lord will provide the lord to jehovah the lord will do this the lord will do this and suddenly somebody comes and bring you into something to pull you down stay tight everybody so when you go to trial to pressure number one no the devil won't fight you if you don't have anything good [Music] do you hear me if there is nothing good in you the devil won't fight you hallelujah if there is nothing on your tree there is no fruit nobody will come there if they are attacking you there is something there meaning you are off his radar you are somewhere there so he is bringing pressure to make you think in a humanistic way and the holy ghost say that when you are under the pressure don't take thought how what you shall speak for it shall be what in the same hour what ye shall what for it is not ye that speaketh [Music] remember the vision is not you do you understand in other words god is saying when you are living here if something come to trouble your hormone don't begin to think about here this realm have revelation available for you [Music] do you hear me do you hear me he said for it is not you that speak but the spirit of your father which speaketh in water but when the lead when they shall lead you and deliver you up take no thought beforehand what you shall speak neither do you how can i do that i'm a human being something happened i have to think over it but whatsoever shall be given to you in that hour that you speak for it is not ye that speak but uh they bring you on to the synagogue again to magistrate and power take no thought how and what thing you shall answer for what you shall say for the holy ghost shall do what in death watch you out to water meaning you are in a different level amen that's why brother branham says this amen what kind of people would it be this morning if this spoken word tabernacle this morning was so filled with the presence of god why when you didn't even use your own did it even use your own did it even you have the ultimate of your own but just be led by the spirit wine and they that are sons of god are led by the spirit of god then when the human element goes out the spirit of god feel that vacancy where you empty yourself [Music] [Applause] when problem comes to your home learn to empty yourself amen hallelujah there will be a wonder church in its power of resurrection of the lord jesus christ we walk in his step in his power in his thought in his being in his water then your thought will become and what will become [Music] are you there are you there here the important things one of the important things that we must master now remember this and especially you young preachers and lay members alike there is one thing that we got to master if we expect to fulfill god's desire in our how many want to see god desire fulfill in their lives if you expect to see god's desire fulfill in your life we have to master the thought of water the pressure the devil brings on you he wants you to use your human ability hallelujah if we ever get to a spot where we think that we can do it with our own intelligence and our own abilities we got to master that in such a way that we can get rid of the thing and lay it aside so that god can use us and make it complete we cannot use one ability we've got to make a complete surrender to come to god you got to surrender to him buffer everything that you are has to be surrendered to god in order that he can work with his will in you and me so when the trials are coming when the preacher comes remember one thing don't use your mind [Music] it is the devil pulling you down everybody clear so far blessed be the name of the lord brother branham say i'm going to say something to you now that i have not said along they think that we have looked forward for so long for at last many years four or five years or maybe longer there has now been and i'm sure you all know what it is now remember there shall never be an impersonation of that because it can be he cannot be now it is in existence it is here and i have i am one of this right at this time now it just happened so it could identify its presence among you so the third pool never left with brother branham hallelujah hallelujah brother branham was there to vindicate to us that that power is now here [Music] hallelujah but [Applause] bad it will not be used in the air brother branham didn't say it will not be used do you hear me do you hear me when you start with faith you have steps number one you have faith number two you go to confession number three you go to work which is completion everybody the third pull also start like that everybody here and he goes leader by leader until he reaches its top what will bring the third pull to its highest stop are you there i hope if we can minimize the movement a manner but it will not be used in a great way until this cancer begin to do what so when the devil squeezes you he's actually making you grow bigger [Applause] hallelujah when the devil begins to pressurize you it means god also is increasing you to a level [Applause] oh my god and when he does the pentecostal and so forth can almost impersonate anything can be done but when that time comes when the water are you squeezing is the devil squeezing you there is something that is coming up amen squeeze down then you shall seek what you have seen will be manifest image fullness of each water [Music] so one trial come your life begin to even rejoice [Applause] because when the enemy comes like a flood the spirit of the lord will lift up a standard against him god will never leave you nor forsake you he will be with you all the way to the end [Applause] hallelujah [Music] that which you have committed unto him until the day of jesus christ [Applause] oh my god blessed be the name of the lord amen hallelujah hallelujah don't be afraid of trial don't be afraid of trial when they put the furnace seven times god is coming down why do you get fight why do you get fight you interpret god wrong you want everything to be easy no when trying to come you think i did something bad i need to repent maybe i did something but you didn't do anything wrong as long as you confess it the blood of jesus christ will wipe everything [Applause] you didn't do anything wrong the devil knows there is a blessing there that's why he's attacking him why did the devil start killing children when jesus was born why did he kill children when moses was born he was trying to get moses somewhere oh my god the last things was to be a great thing would take place we have been watching for it for years and we all know when it happened first when a creation comes into existence the third time then the fourth time last night i thought the fifth time it happened it is waiting for this council of churches when he united and the protestant if i speak sunday morning i mean saturday morning that is what i want to speak on and then when he gets together then the spirit of god always do whatever you are never alone church amen jesus said oh generation of vapor how can he be evil speak good things for out of the abundance of the water the amount of water what is in the heart give me time please we only have one servant a good man out of a good treasure of his heart bringing forth what and an evil man out of the evil treasure bringing forth water so everybody will bring what he has the government will bring water here don't worry about them you need to look in your treasure and bring the good things that you have out hallelujah why are you worrying about what they're doing amen hallelujah but i say unto you that every other word that men speak they shall give an account therefore in the day of judgment for by that that shall be what i thought you justified by faith i thought you justified about works now you are justified by what abraham by that word you shall be justified and by what that word that shall be what life and death in the power of water the bible says i know that work that that are neither cold nor heart i would that that were cold or hard so then because they are lukewarm and neither cold no heart i was purely out of my what does he mean he wants you red hat or one or the other don't be lukewarm just don't pretend something that you have not got either be on fire for god or go back in the water either believe the message or go back where you came from everybody here don't be lukewarm because you are lukewarm neither heart or cold the emotion of the outside the mental water of the water humanistic level because you are that way in humanistic level i will spew you out of my mouth here in other words it make him sick to see the church in that condition about here to be spewed out of the mouth of god blessed be the name of the lord it means what brother branham the church is no longer the water it is his own because it's speaking their own things so god is turning on her on the bride he will confront her the church through the prophet and for the final voice of god will be in water the spirit and the blood says the spirit and the blood the spirit say everybody here what's more the world this world we hear direct from god as at water but of course that word brad will be repudiated as in the first hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord i went unto the angel and say unto him give me the little book and he said unto me take and eat it up you ready are you awake you ready had the book of redemption [Music] can you give me tom but adam had a sill book do you hear me adam had the book of redemption adam spoke to the wind he spoke to the fishes with a close book do you hear me so when adam sinned that closed book went back to god close do you hear me don't god call for a kingsman with him who is ready to take the book and to do what to open and to lose the seal and to reveal what is in the book about but in revelation 10 the book came down but when the book came down the book came down open [Applause] [Music] [Applause] what does it mean a closed book and what does it mean an open book are you gracious to give me time hallelujah what does he mean go to deuteronomy 29 oh my god give me time please if nothing will take a while to get to the lake of fire are you there deuteronomy 29 you there you there but robert gat are you there verse 29 are you there let's go when somebody seals something it means it's water it's a secret does he want to know does does that person want people to know [Music] if i take something i seal it it's my secret i don't want you to know anybody care so when the book was sealed adam had operated with a seal book he went back to god seal in the hand of the original owner god came class came pick up the book and broke the seal and send the book down anybody here what does it mean an open book an open book means the seal has been broken what does it mean is still broken you ready deuteronomy 29 29 the secret things belong to who ever when adam had the book he was sealed he was in the hand of adam but he still belonged to god [Music] did you get me the book of redemption in the hand of adam was given to adam but he still belonged to god that's why when adam messed up god came and said give me my book do you hear me because the book was closed [Applause] are you okay are you okay he belongs to the original owner god can come anytime and say give me my book and he take it he belongs to him [Music] the secret things belong to who to the lord our god by those things which are water belongs to who belong to who and to whom how so when the book is open that book doesn't belong to god [Applause] [Music] [Applause] anymore in adam the book was closed one had a messed up it belongs to god god can take it back but in revelation 10 the book no longer belong to god even if i messed up god cannot come and take the book again [Applause] are you there he belongs to me and my children forever [Applause] hallelujah if me you meet me and god and you have this book don't give it to god come and give it to me do you hear me once god opens up it is no longer for god it is for us and our children forever never to be taken away are you there that's why the angel taught john take it and swallow it [Applause] [Music] he will never go back again to god god lost it forever [Applause] [Music] spoken word is the original water if you take your seed you put on a woman and she got pregnant do you pull it back again forever gone all you will see the belly will begin to grow the baby is coming the baby's coming the baby's coming the baby's coming [Applause] [Music] hallelujah this book doesn't belong to god [Applause] that's why brother branham said it is a love letter once the bread receive it it belongs to the bride [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] hallelujah hallelujah not only not only are you worthy to take the book but forever it belongs to you listen to this the purpose of this seeing your position in christ saying that it is not something that you just stumble into it what i'm preaching you is not something i'm trying to push you are you there or something that you merited something but it's what god did for you not that you were so good that you went to a church one night that some poor brother led you to the altar he was not that he was god before the [Music] predestinated you to eternal life when you get that there that day the 24 hour delays the crime everybody laid their crown everybody fell on their feet they didn't have one thing they could say no preacher no elder no nothing all presents to the lamb god will gather to him all things [Music] hallelujah brother branham say father that knows the reason that i'm approaching the word from this very scripture here because i feel that you want me to do it this way that it is your divine will it is your it is the order of the day to let the people positionally find their place and be ready for the hour of what that's why you gotta know your origin ever here as a brother saying his prayer to you not long ago oh you have trainers so long god father give us our rank put us out there to what we are supposed to do so we can be about the father you have been trained enough it is time to use your weapon and go to action everybody clear brother branham says this hold on with me let me go somewhere in that drop down but here he say here is a woman standing here i'm a young man waiting to get married she met my specification in everywhere she's a lovely christian she looks like one she dresses like one she acts like one she lives like one i shall i didn't i shall admit she'll make me a good wife but she is not mine until i take her for mind that is the way the message is you can sympathize with it and say it's right but you got to take it to yourself you gotta eat the book yourself you gotta take it to yourself become part of it then you and the message become when you are one then the water is with you and as it was with thee hallelujah hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord hallelujah let me get this it's going faster the bible says by the righteousness which is of faith speaketh of this wise say not in the heart who shall what that is to bring christ down from above why why are people asking who shall go to heaven in the book of deuteronomy give me some time you need to get this today hallelujah in the book of deuteronomy in the old testament the bible said for this commandment which are commanded this day is not hidden from thee neither is he far from you it is not in water that you should stay who shall go up for us to heaven and bring it to us that we may hear it moses is saying what i'm telling you is not in heaven because if it's in heaven you're going to say we need somebody to go to heaven pick it up and bring it to us but revelation 10 already brought it down [Music] okay okay neither is it beyond the sea that that should say who shall go over the sea for us to bring it to us that we may hear it this is the old testament by the grain but the word is nigh today is what not on the night but very nice is that what the world is very close to you everybody clear in there and in the hearted month okay that damage what see i have set this day before the day life and what death and water you have both of them in the old testament but their testimony was they must do it are you okay now paul is saying this that by the righteousness which is of faith that was the law he's speaking on these words say it not in the heart who shall go to heaven that is to bring christ down from above christ already came and who shall descend to the deep that is to bring christ again from the dead in other words christ already came paid the press went over there finished the work resurrected again it is finished so don't worry about that part everybody clear what should i worry about but what say is it the word is nighty even in there and in the heart and mouth and tongue that is the word of faith which we preach that is that sir the lord jesus christ and shall believe with them now paul begin to put this thing together now he said this believing god's in the heart and this goes in the mouth now you have the action we okay now okay now confess with the month the lord jesus christ and shall believe in her in the heart that god has rehearsed him from the dead the god of resurrection that shall be water for with them men do what unto righteousness and with them confession is made unto water in second corinthians paul said we have the same spirit of faith according as it's within i am and therefore i have we also and therefore so when you believe you must do what are you ready are you ready now let me say this too there is no blessing in the bible that you can obtain without first water he is the high priest of our our professor confesses the same word it is the high priest of ours he's sitting at the right hand of god the father to make intersection upon our acting as a high priest with his own blood before the father to act upon our what we confess that he has done he is standing before the father to make it water oh my god what are you talking about profess and confess is the same word profess anything or confess anything confess means to water if god said by his trap we are healed then i say by his trap i was sent do you hear me you are not confessing your thoughts no no no hallelujah he said he brought my sin i say hebrew my sin i don't have them anymore he bought them he said he healed me when he died for me at calvary with his tribe i said he healed me there i believe it right now and accepted the settlement no matter how i feel [Applause] if i say well now look you said you are here and look right at your body that don't have one thing to do with him god don't said so he hear what i can see it is water hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord you are not using your own touch you are using let the mind that was in christ being you thinking his way of water so when we telling you confess you are confessing what god already said hallelujah confession means the same to say the same thing confess is to confess the same thing to say the same thing don't confess your own humanistic level be born again and confess his word confess what he's saying that is confession say by his trap i was here by his trap i have by his wound right now i have the right of salvation i have the right for the holy ghost he promised it to me it is you and your children and to them that are far off as many as the lord our god shall call everybody clear so far blessed be the name and the lord when the inspiration of the holy ghost is here to inspire you remember god will make your body come into your water [Music] if you say you are a drunkard i want a drink don't worry you shall shouldn't so be one if you say you are a sinner i want to sin you'll be right into it if you say you are uh and believe it all along god will do whatever your testimony will bring you right into it if you believe in healing and believe that god has healed you do whatever and god will make your body obey you for he is the high priest of you [Applause] he cannot do nothing for you tell you first and do what that is already water and it will make your body your nature come into subject to water you must water like number one you must do what then what then you must do what you must act just like each already you want a baby watch a woman that have a baby and begin to behave like that hallelujah hallelujah i want to tell you something now work on that like joshua did like mary magdalene although just that moment when something is revealed to you do you hear me grab it hold to it that's prayer of a moment sometimes this great procession of water comes right in the time of water because when he squeeze you then god also everybody here it usually crashes that drive us into you think he's being in trial he's just giving me opportunity to receive the revelation hey uh he was a crisis that drove job into him why he was at the end of his life he was a crisis that he presses himself there is where the inspiration struck him blessed be the name of the lord i know it's the truth it's god's word it's the truth something begins to pulsate in your bosom that it is the truth then make what you are coming around after that just as certain as i'm standing in this pulpit tonight don't look at what you see abraham how bad i'm crippled how sick i am what the doctor said don't look at that look at the ascent what god before you feel any different before the pain leaves before the hand moves before the eyes can see one side ye make water for it's going to come as long as that possession begin to rise in your bosom in your heart where god set under control in other words when you begin to feel something coming up grab it [Applause] grab it hallelujah be fearless in your testimony if it's revealed to you you are you don't care with the whole world what they say you are when it's revealed to you that this is the truth coming from god then you are [Applause] hallelujah i think that the holy spirit can lead man and tell him things and make him act different and make him believe things and receive things that the world never could believe could happen i'm a witness oh i can't ah oh can you feel that possession of the spirit begin to rise in your heart saying jesus christ is in our midst wherever two or three are gathering my name i've been there missed pulsation what is a possession it is something moving like ah it's pumping water to you it's pumping energy to your mind then let the things that your eyes see black out that you see not the things of the world you are believing what god have so when you feel something coming up like it's pumping something is repeating in your heart it is a signal it is a signal hallelujah if you believe that with all your heart accept it and do what now you can believe it as much as you wanted to if you didn't works you shall sit right there like a sinner would lay at the altar [Music] he shall never get through until he and confess it and and show what [Music] hallelujah just as the body is dead without the spirit so is faith without work what i no matter how much you believe your faith is not complete until you begin to and you begin to do water what are you using your tongue for what are you using your tongue for you know what people what you know what makes people happy what makes them stand right in the midst of difficulty and say it's so never move they understand god said so you got to have faith but you got to know how to use that faith to make yourself to get happiness out of your life it's not just believing but you must not stop a believing you must move on to confess to confession and you must act like it's already been done then you can gain the benefit of it hallelujah you say you don't have faith brother branham say now healing is not something that you just say well yeah i believe i believe and that's all right if that is the best you can do just mentally or just say well yes i see it i believe it accepted it then if you accepted it in those basis in other words if you accepted it mentally and you can't help it this is the key are you there then if you accepted it on doubts basically in other words if that is the highest you can go okay let me give you a key keep saying it and over saying it out saying it over and over keep saying i'm here say it i'll tell you then when you believe it it's going to do what hallelujah that's why brother branham told john ryan go ahead and continue to do water because your tongue can get get you from here and climb you right here over here are you there with your tongue keep saying it over and over and over and over and over and over are you there because you are saying it hallelujah because you are saying it in your brain this is your brain you are saying it here here and somebody's here yeah this is you this is you are you there if you can move forward there is a miscommunication somebody's sleeping that's why brother branham says say it loud in other words keep saying down to wake him up you say hear me praise the lord i'm healed praise the lord i'm healed praise the lord i'm here praise the lord i'm here [Music] are you there suddenly this person will wake up and say what are you saying praise the lord me okay now press the lord i'm here [Applause]

go up let me help you start using your tongue hallelujah start using your tongue amen john ryan went praise the lord i can see praise the lord i can see and the people begin to make fun of him praise the lord i can see and suddenly he say praise the lord and that man woke up say praise the lord okay water he send energy to the eyes [Music] are you there thomas after you have seen me and felt me your hand in my sight you believe but how much is greater is the reward who have nothing and yet what he is good god he gives you the desire of your heart let's just believe him that is the the death stroke when you just believe god you actually putting a punch to that cancer hallelujah when a man takes god at his word brother that shall do what not what you say what god has said are you there that is the hardest feeling that satan can get when man will take god at his water man shall not leave alone by bread jesus the other night but by every water when you take god at his word automatically satan in hell understand what you're doing are you there could ever get to a place where men and women in this day will be that simple that you will just take god at his will don't wait to see whether i can move this foot or not or disarm or not whether this cancer look like it's gone or this hard trouble is better take god at his word get water a happy water did he say a happy revelation attitude because you're still struggling here brother branham said take god at his word fabricate your happiness [Music] do you hear me you hear me do you hear me make your own baby you say i want my baby when he's born he's going to look like me his nose is going to be like me his eyes like his mother this like this and you take that baby and you begin to push him you say god this is the baby one this is the baby i want this is the baby i want are you there are you there get a happy mentor attitude to order and start water saying god you said so it got to come to pass [Music] [Applause] the book doesn't belong to god she start praising god before she even had any that is going to be she didn't know she never waited till she felt like she didn't wait still something was showing she just believed why brother richie prayed for me last night but i don't see to be i don't seem to be any better you shall never be like that take god at his start whatever and until hallelujah david said to the chief musician upon shoshone for the sons of korra masculine a song of love my heart is in dying it's filled with good mother i speak of the things which i have made touching my the subject of my heart is the things that belong to god that is what have filled my heart and it feels my heart so much that i need a pen to write what is the pen you using david my water is a water of the water when the inspiration is bubbling in your heart don't keep quiet start using them and write on your child write on your husband write on your family written a piece oh it is in the book of some david said when i'm overflowing here i use my pen and i begin to write and i begin to say oh praise god father you're giving me wonderful children they're all serving you they are all christian and they are all filled with the holy spirit and i see them serving you that is the faith of abraham [Music] [Applause] that's the faith of abraham when you walk you're walking happy they say why are you happy you say brother tell me about it my entire family is saved why should that not be happening [Music] i saw your son in a nightclub who no that is not my son my son is saved [Applause] hallelujah my son has already been saved the one you see there that's not my son [Applause] that is not my son mine is safe my family will go to heaven [Applause] my husband is coming where is he at that's not my problem because the inspiration struck me that i'm a woman if i'm a woman i was pulled from somebody ah if i was pushing from somebody that person must be there so i need my person from whom you took me out of it and start praising god like you have it abraham believe god confess calling those things like they were never existed and he put it to action god bless you god bless you [Applause] thank you hallelujah the tongue and your confession the tongue can get you out of here all the way here your prayer can get you out of here all the way here use your tongue adequately when something rises up brother brother say everything that god leads your soul to believe it belongs to you [Music] sometimes we try to make people believe what belongs to you i don't need you to believe what happened what i need because my choice might be different than yours when god revealed to me my choice when something comes in your heart and speak to you and you understand that this is not me because i was not thinking this where does this thought come from grab it and begin to say it if you're struggling say it loud say it loud until the devil hears it until your own self begin to believe it you say it so much when you get to say praise the lord for giving me a house praise the lord for giving me a house praise the lord for giving me a house father i thank you for this beautiful house that you've given me because you spoke in the old testament that you will give me a house that i have not built when you begin to do that god say oh gabriel i told you these children are coming up these children are coming up and do you know what he let the devil turn loose to see if you really mean it amen and the more you do it the more you do it the more you do it you will see after a while it looks like you forgot about it and suddenly something opened up it is not difficult we cannot keep teaching these things and you don't use it we cannot keep saying i'm the faith of the word are they surprised spoken with the spoken word they spoken with let's stop in that attitude of hearing hearing hearing hearing abraham was justified not just believing he believed he spoke by speaking he was doing two things he was first calling what he needed to existence and he was also giving god the glory so if i need a job first i need to call that job and say father thank you for giving me that job i have a job and then once you accepted you say thank you jesus for giving me that job and you begin to get prepared and take your alarm and put even the time you need to start waking up in the morning [Music] this is what abraham was doing not i'm praying for god to give me an opening on wednesday no you need to speak you go back to your supervisor you say you know what i'm a christian i just want to let you know is there a possibility i'm doing this this this this i wanted to do this i wanted this i wanted this i wanted this the lord told me to ask and it shall be given to you that's why i came to ask if there is a possibility if i can get this schedule this kind of schedule i'm asking you as a supervisor i'm coming and i'm asking you the scripture told me to ask sometime the troop officer would say no and then you get discouraged i asked it didn't work if i spoke to the supervisor when i'm going home praise the lord for healing even if the supervisor is not moving that's not my problem but if you keep praising the lord believing that it's already done you will hear that same man calling you he said come here what were you saying the other day yes i talked to my this is your schedule [Music] i say it didn't work what are you losing [Music] what are you losing for trying god what do you lose nothing you can sit quiet two hours or you can sit quiet two hours bothering the devil what do you lose have you tried let's leave the humanistic level it's a lot of headache you work too much you have to work overtime all the time you are tired you have to put yourself at work your wife have to work and your wife have to work too much you got to work too much and you got comfortable with that why is other people working less and they make money and me suffering whether i have a great god father can you bless me with something that i could be able to be free from this situation i want to see my wife enjoying her home yes i want to see her home with the children i'm opening your mind so you don't get stuck to the system until our young people they want to get married is 50 50 50 50. that's not it if she hears it that's no problem but i'm talking about me and my lord solomon say that i see princess walking and i see slave on horses how can a slave be on horse and the prince is walking it's written in your scripture if you need that scripture tell me because princes do not understand and the slave took over and they say oh that stupid child let me ride that car and the child is suffering [Music] amen let's pray heavenly father lord we are approaching you again humbly this morning father thanking you for everything lord we took time and went over because we want this thought to be driven all the way to the end father may you remember your children for the sacrifice they have done to stay up to this time just to receive your instructions lord it's a routine it's a spirit a religious spirit that i infiltrated the message a long time and made people living so low under privileges young people without even any ambition not even looking for further misunderstanding the scripture and the coming of the lord not even understanding how to move in condoning with situation condoning with this present world acting just like anybody until we reach a point where beside what we're hearing there is no difference between us and the man in the next door but father you spoke in your scripture in the old testament that there was a difference between those that serve you and those that were not serving you there was a difference between israel and egypt lord even in the very ground of egypt in goshen father the egyptians were in their land but israel was not in his homeland but even in that strange land father you made a difference between your people and those that were not your children father you could be light in goshen and he was darkness in egypt lord father even there even the egyptian could testify the multiplication of the hebrew even lord father the wise women could say that even when they were giving birth there was a difference between an egyptian woman giving birth and father an israelite woman giving birth [Music] father you made a difference even in the delivery room lord if in that old atonement of a bloody lamb that was lord nature you could do such a thing how much more in this atonement lord of a precious lamb of the lord father may you take the people and may you shake every humanistic father dependency away from them father may we all learn to move away from this ground father and remain in the reins of the revelation in the reigns of the vision lord so that the people can learn not only to be hearers of the word but father to be doers of the word lord lord father use what have been given unto us lord this book that forever remained for us lord forever open lord forever inside the brother forever as our inheritance never to be taken away lord within this book there is many precious promises many precious promises many precious benefit many precious jews that has been put there that your children can use lord in the time of need lord and get the answer to what they're suffering or do what they're looking for lord because you are our lord you are our owner we depend completely upon the lord as a woman depend on the husband lord father i commit your children unto the hand lord may you take this word that has been spoken here and there lord but may you bring a deeper revelation to your children until this will change their life will change their marriages will change their families will change their job their businesses will change their trend of lord living lord until people will notice lord a new difference a new change a new direction a new direction for this church lord so that they can live in the higher land lord and father manifest the light that you sent to us in this end time lord we commit everything unto the hand and thank you in the name of jesus christ amen god bless you church we love you [Music] at night i lay [Music] and i begin to cry and my mind just fails to know [Music] exactly why i can't explain with tongue or pain the spirit's groaning deep within it must be gone hearing my soul i feel [Music] i hear the call [Music] moving me to give he speaks to me [Music] and lord please come and take control [Music] and with each line and phrase he was drawing me to live a higher place [Music] [Applause] [Music] like a great magnet pulling me i know for sure that i'll reach that goal because i feel [Music] [Music] i hear the call [Music] and i know his fear is moving me to give my own he speaks to me [Music] lord please come and take control i filled [Music] i the call and i know his spirit's moving me he speaks to me [Music]
