[16:15] cheap gas you know how we all do
[16:18] and while i was driving through this
[16:19] neighborhood
[16:21] but let me just pause there for a minute
[16:22] two days before that um i was at my
[16:25] house and i felt in my spirit something
[16:26] is not right and and i know if god can
[16:29] talk to the birds and to the dog you
[16:31] know we are so much higher and i felt in
[16:33] my spirits something's about to happen
[16:34] but i ask god you know keep me safe so i
[16:37] was driving to south carolina through
[16:39] this neighborhood and a car came flying
[16:42] out of his driveway and he ran straight
[16:45] into me pushed me on the opposite side
[16:46] of the the road with oncoming traffic
[16:49] but while they saw it and they all
[16:51] slowed down now the driver was having a
[16:53] seizure while this was happening so it

[28:26] priscilla when you got involved in a car
[28:28] wreck any scratch
[28:30] any problem
[28:32] any pain
[28:33] did you hear those answers
[28:35] so what do you think happened
[28:40] it's a time of change
[28:43] it was a time of change
[28:45] she loved that car so much and the
[28:47] change have to come in a brutal way
[28:50] saving her life by just swapping cars
[28:54] and giving her a better car than what
[28:55] she had before
[28:57] so all things work together for what
[29:01] so sometimes your trials are just
[29:03] blessing in disgustment
[29:06] you think it's a trial but it's not
[29:07] really a trial because she's there
[29:09] without a scratch without any pain god
[29:12] just swapped the car in a different way
[29:14] amen
[29:17] the language of god is different
[29:19] sometimes but he all work amen
[29:22] blessed be the name of the lord
[29:25] everybody okay with the showbread
[29:28] anybody lost
[29:30] you good
[29:32] okay praise god
[29:34] okay praise god
[29:38] i went home and i thought it was really
[29:40] really heavy and then you have to go
[29:43] back the second time and then review and
[29:45] make sure because a lot of stuff will
[29:47] drop quickly
[29:49] but i have to stop where i have to stop
[29:51] so we didn't even touch on the
[29:53] drink offering
[29:55] to see the drink offering on the table
[29:57] of the show bread so you keep
[30:00] keep us in prayer and we know the lord
[30:02] will certainly open the door again so we
[30:04] can take where we are and keep moving
[30:07] until we get in the holiest but from now
[30:09] you can
[30:10] already see and have a taste of what is
[30:13] in the holy
[30:14] of holi amen
[30:17] they have have not yet been told so now
[30:19] you understand if you really want to get
[30:21] that half
[30:23] you got to go somewhere
[30:24] amen because if you stay in the holy
[30:27] place
[30:29] you can understand the message
[30:31] intellectually
[30:34] okay we will handle that on sunday amen
[30:37] lord's willing we'll handle that on
[30:39] sunday somebody asked me a great
[30:41] question either yesterday or today i'm
[30:43] not sure again but i wish that question
[30:45] was in uh
[30:47] in the
[30:48] [Music]
[30:49] uh house meeting
[30:50] but it's very very very important he
[30:53] asked a question he's he was reading the
[30:55] book of jos uh the story of joseph and
[30:58] suddenly when you start the story you
[31:00] usually expect the story to flow from
[31:03] the beginning all the way to the end
[31:05] then in genesis i believe 38 the story
[31:09] stopped and went to judah and begin to
[31:11] talk like in and out of another story so
[31:14] it seems like you start joseph and
[31:16] you're following joseph when you reach
[31:19] genesis 38 you stop there then it's
[31:21] speaking about judah going to tamar you
[31:23] know the story about tamar and
[31:25] everything and if you look at the
[31:27] connection there is no connection
[31:29] between judah and joseph at all then
[31:32] after genesis 38 in genesis 39 then the
[31:35] bible pick up again and begin to speak
[31:38] about joseph again so it looks like
[31:40] there is a chapter that was inserted
[31:43] somewhere that doesn't really look like
[31:46] it should be
[31:47] amen
[31:48] okay i gave you a homework i see some of
[31:51] you look at me you give your homework
[31:52] you go read the story of joseph and
[31:54] you'll find that genesis chapter 38
[31:57] seems to be like it's odd it's not in a
[32:00] proper place
[32:01] but it is in the proper place
[32:04] amen the scriptures are mathematically
[32:07] placed in the scripture if you need the
[32:08] quote i will show you brother branham
[32:10] say there are
[32:12] the the bible have some mathematics that
[32:14] goes with it so what seems to be like
[32:16] it's out of place it's really a
[32:19] revelation that it was inserted there if
[32:22] you study you will go with genesis
[32:24] leviticus numbers you get to judges if
[32:28] you study the process of the event the
[32:31] event goes well until a certain time
[32:35] roof is inserted
[32:37] if you look you look like they're taking
[32:39] you off from the story of israel to
[32:42] another land then after roof then the go
[32:45] back again to the promised land with
[32:47] first samuel and then they begin to
[32:49] introduce the first king of israel then
[32:51] it goes to the chronicle and you will
[32:53] wonder why is roof inserted right there
[32:56] it looks like roof came and then it's
[32:59] like a bracket in a scripture
[33:01] that the cut the scripture left and
[33:04] right and they insert something there
[33:06] those things are inserted for a certain
[33:08] way
[33:09] amen
[33:10] let me give you one so he can't help you
[33:12] up if you go in revelation chapter six
[33:15] you will see the open all the seals
[33:17] except the seven seal have you noticed
[33:20] that
[33:20] if you go to revelation chapter six you
[33:22] will see the first seal is open the
[33:24] second city is open the third is open
[33:26] the fourth is open the six is open and
[33:28] you will think the seven will be open
[33:30] there then when you reach the end there
[33:32] is no seven seal
[33:34] then when you go to revelation chapter
[33:36] seven you will think you will expect the
[33:38] seventh seal to be there it's not there
[33:41] and then when you go to revelation eight
[33:43] then you see the seventh cell so why is
[33:45] the seven entered there why why is that
[33:49] separation
[33:50] it's things that are hidden in the
[33:52] scripture so i'm saying that so to kind
[33:55] of stir you up so you can go home and
[33:57] review some of you are lost because you
[34:00] don't read the bible the way you're
[34:01] supposed to
[34:02] some are reading the bible they open
[34:04] here they close they open here the
[34:05] clothes they open here the clothes
[34:07] that's all they do you don't read the
[34:08] bible like that sometimes take the book
[34:10] of genesis start from genesis 1 all the
[34:13] way to the end and you take leviticus
[34:15] all the way to the end amen
[34:17] you already we already went to exodus 25

[37:11] if you weren't a believer so the very
[37:13] fact that you're here is is testament
[37:17] but when we believe it's a guarantee
[37:20] we will receive
[37:22] amen so we greet you tonight in the name
[37:24] of our lord and savior jesus christ i
[37:27] want to thank brother seth coffey for
[37:29] coming with me this evening and uh my
[37:32] wife went over uh
[37:34] to her post of duty there at the home
[37:35] church but
[37:36] we bring greetings from brother josh and
[37:38] the believers there brother richie
[37:40] douglas asked me to give greetings to
[37:43] the believers tonight he's he's
[37:44] ministering where brother fred mullins
[37:46] pastors
[37:47] down in south carolina tonight and so
[37:50] god is good i want to invite you to turn
[37:52] with me in your bibles to ezekiel
[37:53] chapter 37
[37:55] and as i uh
[37:57] i was getting close to coming out and i
[37:59] thought i've preached on from this
[38:01] passage of scripture before
[38:03] but
[38:05] it's got a maybe a new
[38:07] inspiration tonight
[38:09] and so we want the lord to minister in
[38:11] our midst and have his way and i wanted
[38:13] to tell you this too many of you have
[38:15] been praying
[38:17] for a situation with my wife and i
[38:20] to adopt a child
[38:22] and so at first
[38:23] uh you know we were just kind of keeping
[38:25] things uh to ourselves
[38:27] and then
[38:28] eventually the county became involved
[38:30] and they came they said we want to do a
[38:32] study of your home
[38:34] and so they sent a lady out and she
[38:36] interviewed me she interviewed sister
[38:38] faith she she looked all over the
[38:40] property in the home there
[38:41] and she called my wife last wednesday
[38:44] and she said faith that's my wife's name
[38:47] she said faith when we do a home study
[38:50] she said even under the best of
[38:52] circumstances we always try to find one
[38:56] weakness
[38:57] one thing that we can point to to ask
[39:00] the parents you know to improve upon
[39:02] this
[39:03] to make the situation ideal for the
[39:05] adoption she said in your case we find
[39:07] zero
[39:09] we find no
[39:10] weaknesses
[39:12] and so praise the lord for that amen
[39:14] you know uh we're not doing anything
[39:17] we're in the middle of what god is doing
[39:21] amen when you're pushing and you're
[39:22] pressing and you're doing all this relax
[39:26] when when when you're in the middle of
[39:27] what god is doing
[39:29] you're going to be amazed at what he
[39:31] does through you amen
[39:33] so we appreciate the lord tonight
[39:35] uh we're going to read here in ezekiel
[39:37] 37 beginning at verse number 11 and just
[39:41] before we
[39:42] read these verses of scripture we'd like
[39:44] to go to the author in prayer
[39:47] and if you're desiring something from
[39:48] the lord tonight you'd like to lift your
[39:50] hand in his presence
[39:52] we believe the lord will supply
[39:54] heavenly father we are grateful that we
[39:56] have strength
[39:58] lord and we have liberty and freedom to
[40:01] be able to come
[40:03] lord and we're thankful for a desire
[40:05] that you place there to come lord and
[40:07] join
[40:08] with other believers in lifting our
[40:10] voices and our hearts to you
[40:12] we're thankful lord that you promised
[40:14] where two or three are gathered you
[40:16] would be in our midst that's what we're
[40:18] depending on tonight that's what brought
[40:19] us here and lord as we now approach your
[40:22] word we know with
[40:24] some education we could read its
[40:26] contents but lord we want the contents
[40:29] to come from the pages
[40:31] lord and live in our lives
[40:33] and we want what only the holy spirit
[40:35] can do
[40:36] that's to come break the bread of life
[40:38] to our hearts
[40:39] we don't question that this is your word
[40:42] but we realize it takes a supernatural
[40:44] element
[40:45] lord to quicken this word
[40:47] into living word
[40:49] and we pray tonight lord as as that
[40:52] happens as that takes place it will
[40:54] bring spiritual healing it'll bring
[40:56] physical healing it'll lift the faith
[40:59] lord of your children to rise above the
[41:02] circumstances or whatever may appear to
[41:05] our natural senses but lord made the
[41:08] word appeal to that super sense
[41:11] lord to lay hold upon the promise
[41:14] lord and to walk into the realization of
[41:16] it granted tonight lord bless brother
[41:18] stephen and the believers lord and bless
[41:21] your children who have come some perhaps
[41:23] lord don't even know why they're here
[41:25] tonight but you do
[41:26] and we pray father god that your purpose
[41:28] and your desire for this service would
[41:31] fully express that i lord would not
[41:33] hinder may you forgive me lord may the
[41:36] blood of jesus christ right now atone
[41:39] for all of our sins our faults our
[41:42] iniquities our shortcomings lord we
[41:44] plead the blood of jesus christ over our
[41:46] lives and over this service tonight that
[41:49] all that is said and done will bring
[41:50] glory and honor to you
[41:52] that we may walk out of here tonight
[41:54] lord in liberty and in victory
[41:56] lord for your glory and honor we ask it
[41:59] in jesus name we pray amen
[42:02] verse 11 then he said unto me
[42:05] son of man
[42:07] these bones are the whole house of
[42:10] israel
[42:11] behold they say our bones are dried and
[42:15] our hope is lost we are cut off for our
[42:18] parts
[42:19] therefore prophesy and say unto them
[42:23] thus saith the lord god
[42:26] now i want to ask you tonight what are
[42:28] you interested in what you say
[42:31] or what he says
[42:34] because we just read what they said
[42:37] but now we're going to read what he says
[42:40] thus saith the lord god behold all
[42:44] my people
[42:45] he's taking possession ownership behold
[42:49] my people i will open your graves and
[42:52] cause you to come up out of your graves
[42:55] and bring you into the land of israel
[42:59] and you shall know that i am the lord
[43:03] when i have opened your graves o my
[43:05] people and brought you up out of your
[43:07] graves and shall put my spirit in you my
[43:11] spirit
[43:12] in you and you shall live and you shall
[43:16] i shall place you in your own land
[43:20] then shall ye know that i the lord have
[43:24] spoken it and
[43:26] performed it
[43:28] saith the lord
[43:31] may the lord bless the reading of his
[43:33] word and you can be seated tonight
[43:35] amen i'm going to read i'm just going to
[43:37] jump right into this portion of a
[43:39] message called the revelation of jesus
[43:41] christ
[43:42] and the brother adam is talking about
[43:44] the book of revelation and he says it
[43:45] has more symbols in it
[43:48] than all the rest of the books in the
[43:50] bible it has more symbols because it is
[43:53] a book of prophecy
[43:56] it's a prophetic book
[43:58] therefore it has to be understood
[44:02] by a prophetic class
[44:05] this book is not meant for everybody
[44:08] there's nobody can understand it hardly
[44:11] this book is made for a certain class
[44:16] of people
[44:17] over in on in deuteronomy it says the
[44:19] hidden things belong to the lord that is
[44:21] right and he reveals to us
[44:24] his children
[44:26] the hidden things
[44:29] oh my you're not making yourself one of
[44:31] his children you're recognizing what he
[44:34] has already made you
[44:35] amen
[44:36] the carnal mind cannot comprehend them
[44:39] great things of the scripture because
[44:41] it's foolish to them
[44:43] now he's talking about the bible
[44:45] he's not talking about his ministry he's
[44:47] not talking about his message he's
[44:49] talking about this bible and he says
[44:51] it's a foolish book it's a mysterious
[44:54] book it's a misunderstood book it's an
[44:57] argued book to everybody but one group
[45:00] or one class of people
[45:03] that's the bible now if that is the case
[45:06] with the bible then it would certainly
[45:08] be the case with the revelation of that
[45:10] bible which is revealed through the
[45:13] ministry of god's prophet
[45:15] william branham
[45:19] the carnal mind cannot comprehend them
[45:21] great things of the scripture
[45:23] because it's foolish to them
[45:26] but to the ones who are lovers of the
[45:29] word of god
[45:31] that's who the book was written to
[45:34] that's the church the revelation of
[45:37] jesus christ to the church
[45:39] at ephesus to the church of smyrna to
[45:42] the church churches on death the
[45:44] revelation of jesus christ to the church
[45:47] you say which church brother tim the one
[45:49] he started in matthew 16 upon this rock
[45:53] i will build my church and the gates of
[45:56] hell shall not prevail against it and
[46:00] notice it is also the consummation of
[46:02] the scriptures the complete consummation
[46:05] and it's geographically placed at the
[46:06] right place at the end of the bible the
[46:09] revelation of the whole thing placed
[46:11] back here with a blessing to who hears
[46:14] it
[46:15] who reads it and hears it and a curse to
[46:17] them that'll add or take away
[46:21] so what i want to share with you tonight
[46:23] as we just move into this
[46:25] is a prophetic class of people
[46:29] is a people that have the ability
[46:32] amen to hear to recognize to be affected
[46:36] by and to respond to a prophetic
[46:39] ministry
[46:42] that's not everybody
[46:43] that's a special class that's a special
[46:46] group of people
[46:48] you know i i just think of the time when
[46:50] elijah was up in the mouth of the cave
[46:52] and he said lord you know i'm just i'm
[46:54] the only one left i'm the only believer
[46:56] and god said no you're not
[46:58] there's seven thousand
[47:00] that have not bowed the knee to bell
[47:02] amen god didn't just send you elijah i
[47:04] sent some followers amen i said you
[47:07] weren't just sent to make yourself the
[47:09] object or the show amen i sent a people
[47:12] who are predestinated with receivers
[47:15] down on the inside that when they hear
[47:17] your voice
[47:18] it's going to enact a response
[47:21] to prophecy
[47:22] they are a prophetic class of people
[47:26] amen i believe you're part of that
[47:28] tonight amen he said in peter first
[47:31] peter 2 verse 9 peter said but ye are a
[47:34] chosen generation
[47:37] and unholy nation
[47:39] a peculiar people
[47:42] you know young people get defeated they
[47:44] say brother tim i am different i'm odd i
[47:46] stand out you're supposed to
[47:49] you're not supposed to blend in with the
[47:51] world they're not supposed to be
[47:53] comfortable around you and you're not
[47:54] supposed to be comfortable around them
[47:57] and then why because you're from
[47:58] different origins
[48:00] and you have a different destination
[48:03] so there's a reason you're different and
[48:05] it's nothing to be ashamed of and the
[48:07] only reason that the devil's trying to
[48:09] shame you is because he's jealous of who
[48:12] you are what you have where you came
[48:15] from and where you're going
[48:17] so it's about time amen we lift our head
[48:20] up put our chin out and puff up our
[48:22] chest and say satan i'm a son of god i'm
[48:25] a daughter of god i came from god and i
[48:28] returned to god get out of my way
[48:33] you have to know who you are
[48:36] otherwise you're wishy-washy you're weak
[48:39] you're compromised you don't know who
[48:42] you are you wake up one morning you feel
[48:44] one way you wake up the next morning you
[48:46] feel another way and the devil pushes
[48:48] you around and bluffs you around like
[48:50] the weak little chicken you are
[48:52] but if you ever hear an eagle cry
[48:54] and you recognize
[48:57] that ain't the only eagle there's one
[48:59] down on the inside of here and you get
[49:01] up and fly out of that barnyard you're
[49:03] gonna show those chickens you never was
[49:06] a chicken in the first place
[49:10] amen
[49:12] hallelujah
[49:14] that little eagle never became an eagle
[49:16] he recognized what he had been the
[49:18] entire time
[49:20] and it took him here in the cry of
[49:22] another mature eagle and he said my
[49:24] goodness if one can do it i can do it
[49:27] too
[49:28] because the same potentials lie within
[49:31] you
[49:34] doesn't make every woman a prophetess
[49:36] doesn't make every man a preacher but it
[49:39] makes you a prophetic class of people
[49:44] hallelujah
[49:45] that have the ability to recognize and
[49:48] respond
[49:49] to prophecy
[49:51] so the prophecy has a unique effect upon
[49:54] you
[49:56] because when you hear it you're not
[49:58] hearing opinion
[50:00] you're not hearing an argument
[50:02] you're not hearing an enlightened view
[50:04] you're not hearing yet one more ministry
[50:08] you are hearing an absolute
[50:10] you are hearing a divine
[50:12] interpretation with divine vindication
[50:15] and i want to tell you that that
[50:17] vindication is not confined to what a
[50:20] camera could capture or what could be
[50:22] printed on a piece of paper or what
[50:24] could be engraved on a stone but that
[50:27] vindication is a living bride hallelujah
[50:30] with rapturing faith down on the inside
[50:33] and her life is being transformed by
[50:35] that word
[50:36] justification sanctification the baptism
[50:40] of the holy ghost and rapture
[50:44] amen
[50:45] the rapture is not coming for
[50:48] books and tapes the rapture is not
[50:50] coming for perishable things the rapture
[50:52] is coming for the intangible value of
[50:55] who you are down on the inside
[50:59] you've already heard the shout
[51:01] out
[51:03] you're not waiting on a shout you
[51:06] recognize to shout
[51:08] the shout is what awakened you
[51:11] and you said i'm not a pentecostal
[51:14] i'm not a baptist i'm not a catholic and
[51:17] i'm not a sinner
[51:19] i'm a son of god i'm a daughter of god
[51:23] these bones
[51:25] shall live again
[51:28] amen
[51:30] resurrection is not replacement
[51:33] it's bringing back to a divine order
[51:36] what was once in the mind of god before
[51:39] the foundation of the world as he came
[51:42] down and was wrapped in flesh now his
[51:44] word
[51:46] is wrapped in flesh
[51:48] in a many-membered body
[51:51] praise the lord
[51:54] i want to title this message tonight
[51:56] better
[51:58] than before
[52:00] [Music]
[52:01] [Laughter]
[52:04] better
[52:06] than before
[52:08] i go out to phelps kentucky that's coal
[52:10] mining country
[52:11] and out there they'll find cold deeply
[52:14] embedded in those hills and in those
[52:16] mountains they've got all manner of ways
[52:19] all sorts of ways to go extract that
[52:21] coal
[52:22] but they're also some legal
[52:25] parameters
[52:27] there are some legal guidelines that
[52:29] those mining companies have to follow
[52:32] one of the things they'll do is they'll
[52:33] go find a hill or find a big tall
[52:34] mountain and it's just full of coal that
[52:37] you know they can mine that coal out and
[52:39] turn it into electricity somehow
[52:42] but those mining companies have laws
[52:43] they have to follow
[52:45] they'll go in and they'll drill down in
[52:47] that mountain they'll drill drill drill
[52:49] drill drill and they'll blow it up and
[52:50] they'll get all that coal out i mean
[52:52] just truckload after truckload train
[52:54] load after train load a coal comes out
[52:56] of there
[52:56] but when they're done
[52:58] they can't leave it
[53:01] they can't leave it
[53:03] in that chaotic
[53:05] mess
[53:07] that they made to extract the coal
[53:09] there's something called reclaiming
[53:12] and there are federal and state laws
[53:15] that absolutely dictate to those mining
[53:18] companies they have to put the mountain
[53:20] back
[53:22] so first of all they had to know what it
[53:24] was in the first place
[53:26] so they've got geographical ways of
[53:28] measuring the height the breadth all the
[53:30] dimensions of that mountain they know
[53:32] what it is before they drill the first
[53:33] hole
[53:34] before they put off the first stick of
[53:36] dynamite they know exactly what that
[53:38] mountain is
[53:40] and so they have to reconstruct that
[53:43] mountain
[53:44] back to the exact dimensions that it was
[53:48] before they extracted the coal
[53:51] and there's state and federal
[53:53] authorities that will enforce that onto
[53:56] those mining companies
[53:58] to make them put it back the way it was
[54:00] before
[54:01] but here's the thing about it brother
[54:02] sister as far as what is humanly
[54:06] possible
[54:08] no matter how well
[54:10] to the to the eye to to our visibility
[54:14] no matter how much it looks like the
[54:17] mountain before
[54:19] i mean they have to put grass on it they
[54:21] have to plant trees there's all kinds of
[54:23] things they have to do so to you know to
[54:25] somebody just walking up to it it can
[54:27] look like it's been restored
[54:30] to everything that it was before
[54:33] but man
[54:35] is limited in his ability and what man
[54:39] cannot do
[54:40] is put the treasure back
[54:45] it may look like the same hill
[54:47] it may resemble everything it resembled
[54:49] before but it's missing the treasure
[54:53] it's missing the value
[54:56] it's missing the essence or the worth
[55:00] that it once held oh my
[55:04] which is why it was destroyed in the
[55:06] first place
[55:08] is because there was value on the inside
[55:12] that someone recognized and they were
[55:15] destroying the mountain to try to get
[55:18] the treasure out and you wonder why
[55:20] you're fighting
[55:22] and you wonder why you're struggling and
[55:24] you wonder why the devil's telling you
[55:26] why don't you give up why don't you quit
[55:29] why don't you just lay it down and walk
[55:31] away he's trying to destroy something
[55:34] because he knows there is value down on
[55:37] the inside of you
[55:39] and he's trying to tear your life apart
[55:42] amen he's telling you why don't you quit
[55:44] church
[55:45] why don't you leave the message amen why
[55:48] don't you just give up and go away you
[55:49] know you can't live it you know what a
[55:51] hypocrite you are he's trying to tear
[55:53] you apart
[55:54] because there's treasure down on the
[55:56] inside of you
[55:57] and he's trying to marginalize the
[56:01] effect the value of who you are in your
[56:04] own eyes
[56:09] [Music]
[56:10] before a man can ever take advantage of
[56:13] a woman he has to first destroy her
[56:15] self-esteem
[56:19] he has to first lower her worth
[56:22] and her value in her own eyes
[56:26] he can never physically overtake her
[56:30] until first of all he reduces her
[56:34] [Music]
[56:36] that's the devil doing that
[56:38] that's the devil trying to get you to
[56:40] lay down your morals trying to get you
[56:42] to lay down your values trying to tell
[56:44] you you gotta settle for something less
[56:48] you don't have to settle for less
[56:51] amen
[56:52] there is no peace
[56:54] achieved through compromise
[56:57] there is no victory achieved by backing
[57:00] up and making a deal with the devil
[57:03] we don't have to deal with the devil
[57:05] we are dealing with a defeated devil
[57:08] and what we've got to do is recognize
[57:11] the battle has already been won and
[57:14] we've got to stand our ground and say
[57:17] satan
[57:18] i didn't win this jesus christ did but i
[57:21] sure ain't backing up from it
[57:23] i'm not backing up for my healing i'm
[57:25] not backing up for my salvation i'm not
[57:28] backing up for my loved ones everything
[57:30] that book says
[57:32] i'm gonna stand on it
[57:35] hallelujah
[57:37] friends
[57:39] amen
[57:41] god has staked his reputation on your
[57:45] victory
[57:51] god's not wondering if you're going to
[57:53] make it god's not wondering if you're
[57:55] going to go victorious out of laodicea
[57:57] god's not wondering if you're going to
[57:59] make a rapture god has staked his
[58:02] eternal reputation
[58:04] on you
[58:06] amen hallelujah
[58:09] if you knew the truth tonight you know
[58:11] you already made it
[58:13] you know you're already an overcomer
[58:15] he's already seen you on the other side
[58:18] amen
[58:20] but satan cannot defile you
[58:22] till he first reduces your value
[58:26] in your own eyes
[58:27] [Music]
[58:28] amen so here let me just for a moment
[58:30] refer to my
[58:32] opening scripture
[58:34] god takes ezekiel out to this valley
[58:37] not only dead bones and dry bones but
[58:39] dismembered
[58:41] and disunified
[58:44] and scattered
[58:46] from the way they were originally joined
[58:49] together
[58:52] and then he asked his prophet a question
[58:54] can these bones
[58:56] live again
[58:58] and god wasn't just going to make them
[59:00] live again
[59:02] he was going to restore them back to
[59:04] their original order
[59:08] the way they were originally joined
[59:12] he was going to put bone back to his
[59:14] bone
[59:15] he was going to put sinew upon him he
[59:17] was gonna put skin upon him and they
[59:19] were gonna stand up and he was gonna
[59:21] breathe his spirit of life into those
[59:23] bones
[59:25] and they were gonna go out and defeat
[59:28] a new enemy
[59:34] enemies
[59:35] who had advanced in their weaponry
[59:39] and their armament
[59:40] and their strategy and their tactics
[59:43] these enemies had honed the craft of war
[59:48] to be more mighty
[59:50] more powerful
[59:51] and hate israel even more than they did
[59:52] in the beginning but we have this idea
[59:55] amongst our ranks today that our young
[59:57] people need a modernized holy ghost
[1:00:00] like we need to play some more modern
[1:00:02] music
[1:00:04] or we need to bring some some worldly
[1:00:06] themes into the church you know we need
[1:00:08] to attract our young people i'm going to
[1:00:10] tell you what's going to attract young
[1:00:11] people is reality
[1:00:14] we don't need a different holy ghost
[1:00:17] we need the same holy ghost that fell on
[1:00:20] the book of acts the same holy ghost
[1:00:23] will bring a body up out of the grave
[1:00:26] amen bring a dead body back together
[1:00:28] again with the same power the same
[1:00:31] vindication the same demon conquering
[1:00:34] power that god has always been god just
[1:00:37] wants to get his glory through a new
[1:00:40] vessel
[1:00:43] amen
[1:00:45] we don't need a modernized holy ghost we
[1:00:47] need the same holy ghost that fell on
[1:00:50] the day of pentecost when it falls again
[1:00:53] it don't matter how much the devil is
[1:00:55] modernized you can't improve on
[1:00:57] perfection
[1:00:58] and god's plan was perfect in the
[1:01:00] beginning
[1:01:02] god's power was sufficient at pentecost
[1:01:04] and insufficient tonight
[1:01:06] the problem with these watered down
[1:01:09] weakened and diluted versions of the
[1:01:11] gospel is we've tried to weave man's
[1:01:14] ideas into a divine message from god and
[1:01:18] i wouldn't go for it either
[1:01:21] i wouldn't go for it either
[1:01:23] if i can't have something original
[1:01:25] if i can't have something invincible
[1:01:28] if i can't have something with a proven
[1:01:30] track record
[1:01:31] that satan has never been able to
[1:01:32] withstand
[1:01:34] let me go
[1:01:39] it's the old time holy spirit
[1:01:41] and the devil can't come near it
[1:01:44] that's the reason modernists fear it but
[1:01:47] it's good enough for me
[1:01:50] hey
[1:01:51] man hallelujah
[1:01:53] amen
[1:01:55] praise god praise god
[1:01:58] amen
[1:01:59] this army
[1:02:01] is going to be better
[1:02:04] than the army that fell
[1:02:07] this army is going to be stronger
[1:02:10] than the before they were victimized
[1:02:12] then before they were disunified
[1:02:16] before they were scattered from one end
[1:02:18] to the other they're gonna come back
[1:02:20] together
[1:02:22] and they're gonna defeat satan again
[1:02:25] even more so
[1:02:27] than they did before
[1:02:30] praise god
[1:02:32] better than before
[1:02:37] you know what
[1:02:39] the devil is almost
[1:02:43] as dumb as he is determined
[1:02:45] that is the most determined devil i've
[1:02:47] ever seen in my life
[1:02:49] no matter how many times he fails no
[1:02:51] matter how many times he loses no matter
[1:02:53] how many times god turns his own tricks
[1:02:55] around on his own head he still comes
[1:02:57] back for more
[1:03:00] better than before
[1:03:02] satan entered the garden of eden and
[1:03:04] began having a conversation with mrs
[1:03:07] adam
[1:03:08] to lower her worth
[1:03:11] by getting her to move out from under
[1:03:13] the protection of the word by convincing
[1:03:16] her that he had a little more to offer
[1:03:19] the devil's more is less
[1:03:22] trust me
[1:03:24] amen
[1:03:26] so he felt like he had achieved his
[1:03:29] objective
[1:03:31] when eve entered into the transgression
[1:03:34] and god came and dealt with the
[1:03:36] situation
[1:03:37] but you know what
[1:03:39] when adam and eve
[1:03:42] embraced again
[1:03:45] adam wasn't embracing
[1:03:48] a new wife
[1:03:50] he was embracing an original
[1:03:54] [Music]
[1:03:55] god didn't go out and find another piece
[1:03:57] of clay
[1:03:59] and make another bride for adam
[1:04:01] he had already made
[1:04:03] the only bride
[1:04:06] that adam would ever know
[1:04:08] as a bride
[1:04:10] you see friend they weren't just joined
[1:04:13] at that time they had not even known
[1:04:15] each other as husband and wife in the
[1:04:16] way of family relations
[1:04:19] but they had an emotional bond
[1:04:21] they had a bond because they came from
[1:04:24] the same source
[1:04:27] they could have fellowship because they
[1:04:29] loved the same creator
[1:04:31] they had the same interest in the same
[1:04:32] objective and the devil defiled those
[1:04:34] interests but don't you know
[1:04:37] don't you know that the day he embraced
[1:04:40] her again
[1:04:42] they had a stronger bond
[1:04:45] because now they no longer took for
[1:04:48] granted
[1:04:50] the things that before they could never
[1:04:53] appreciate because there was no contrast
[1:04:57] so in the devil's efforts
[1:05:00] to make the relationship
[1:05:02] severed
[1:05:04] inseparable
[1:05:06] never to be restored he did the opposite
[1:05:10] god rejoined her
[1:05:12] back to
[1:05:14] the side she originated from
[1:05:17] and she said honey i'll never leave you
[1:05:18] again
[1:05:19] oh he said he said dear darling i'll
[1:05:21] never ignore you again
[1:05:23] i don't care how tired i am from
[1:05:25] speaking things into existence i'll make
[1:05:27] some time for you in the evening i'll
[1:05:30] take you somewhere nice we'll go down by
[1:05:32] the ocean side and feel the breeze we'll
[1:05:34] share some romantic time together he
[1:05:37] learned how to rearrange his priorities
[1:05:42] amen
[1:05:44] so she would have no interest
[1:05:48] in what any other man had to say
[1:05:50] she had one bond and that was to the
[1:05:54] macho man adam her husband
[1:05:58] the man who saved her the man who
[1:06:00] rescued her the man who reached across
[1:06:03] the chasm and said you're the only one
[1:06:06] for me
[1:06:08] i can never have another
[1:06:10] because you came from my side
[1:06:16] a redeemed relationship
[1:06:19] friends
[1:06:20] relationship is everything
[1:06:24] relationship is the key
[1:06:26] jesus said i come from god i return to
[1:06:29] god
[1:06:30] you've got to go back where you came
[1:06:32] from
[1:06:33] amen your destination wealth can be no
[1:06:35] other than your origin
[1:06:38] oh hallelujah
[1:06:41] that's the only thing you can go back to
[1:06:43] is what you came from in the first place
[1:06:47] i'll never leave you i'll never forsake
[1:06:50] you
[1:06:51] you will be my only
[1:06:52] attraction and adoration all my heart
[1:06:55] and soul you see the
[1:06:57] the serpent
[1:06:59] the serpent could entertain her
[1:07:01] the serpent could fascinate her
[1:07:03] the serpent could capture her attention
[1:07:05] momentarily but he could never fulfill
[1:07:10] her soul
[1:07:12] because she and adam
[1:07:14] were of the same
[1:07:16] source
[1:07:18] and of the same soul
[1:07:20] and that's what made the bond
[1:07:24] was they were together
[1:07:26] originally so she could never ever be
[1:07:30] remarried or rejoined
[1:07:32] to any other person
[1:07:34] no matter how wonderful he would be
[1:07:36] you'd never be adam
[1:07:38] no matter how beautiful she may be she
[1:07:39] would never be the original mrs adam
[1:07:43] that's why adam took her back
[1:07:47] he took himself back
[1:07:50] in a feminine expression
[1:07:51] [Music]
[1:07:54] oh my
[1:07:56] it said there was a there was a lady
[1:07:58] going through the airport one day and
[1:08:00] the flight was about to leave you know
[1:08:02] it was past departure time she's an old
[1:08:04] lady she's staggering you know she's on
[1:08:06] a k and she's walking through this
[1:08:08] terminal and they keep announcing over
[1:08:09] the intercom the boarding is closing the
[1:08:11] boarding is closing hurry up and get on
[1:08:13] this flight you know maybe she was
[1:08:14] leaving charlotte going to

[1:08:23] she never fretted
[1:08:25] she never got anxiety
[1:08:27] and and everyone around her
[1:08:30] was getting more and more anxious
[1:08:32] can't you hear
[1:08:34] me don't you understand
[1:08:36] does the urgency of the situation not
[1:08:39] have any impact on you and finally she
[1:08:41] said look

[1:09:48] am it's not about how old i am
[1:09:51] he's my captain
[1:09:54] and we're related
[1:09:56] and he's not going to leave without me
[1:10:01] knowing your position
[1:10:04] gives you faith
[1:10:06] and will relax you
[1:10:10] you don't have to you don't have to tell
[1:10:12] anybody
[1:10:13] you don't have to convince anybody you
[1:10:15] know when you see people trying to
[1:10:16] convince a devil
[1:10:19] you see people trying to convince the
[1:10:20] devil to come out of somebody
[1:10:21] [Music]
[1:10:23] it's because they don't know who they
[1:10:24] are
[1:10:26] you see somebody trying to convince
[1:10:27] somebody that they're a christian
[1:10:29] they're a member of the bride they don't
[1:10:30] know who they are
[1:10:32] when you know who you are
[1:10:34] you don't have to say a word
[1:10:36] jesus never walked up to a demon and
[1:10:37] said let me give you my resume
[1:10:41] know
[1:10:42] who he was
[1:10:44] was his value
[1:10:46] he walked up
[1:10:49] he never said a word and the devil said
[1:10:51] why have you come to torment us before
[1:10:54] our time
[1:10:56] hey man you get that kind of
[1:10:57] relationship you get that kind of
[1:10:59] connection with god amen you'll be a
[1:11:02] walking powerhouse at home at school at
[1:11:05] work at play in laodicea the devil knows
[1:11:09] exactly who you are the question is do
[1:11:12] you know
[1:11:13] do you know who you are
[1:11:15] you don't have to bow down you don't
[1:11:17] have to buck i mean you don't have to
[1:11:19] compromise one thing stand your ground
[1:11:22] as sons and daughters of god
[1:11:26] hallelujah
[1:11:29] amen
[1:11:31] years ago i had a real close
[1:11:34] my wife and i both had two of our
[1:11:35] dearest friends
[1:11:37] i mean our dearest friends we were close
[1:11:40] to them because they were dedicated
[1:11:42] believers
[1:11:43] we was in a church years and years ago
[1:11:46] mixed multitude
[1:11:48] some were worldly some were loose
[1:11:50] some were moderates
[1:11:52] and some were really dedicated
[1:11:54] some took the message
[1:11:57] for what it meant
[1:11:59] and what it said
[1:12:00] and they weren't trying to carve out or
[1:12:02] cut away or trim up or no they just took
[1:12:04] it if if the word of god says it that's
[1:12:07] that's it that's that's who i am
[1:12:10] and we had this relationship we were the
[1:12:13] best of friends with this brother and
[1:12:15] his wife and then uh separation came
[1:12:18] the church we were attending begin to
[1:12:20] you know just kind of go into some
[1:12:21] things and we just it just wasn't
[1:12:24] you know it was given a lot of spiritual
[1:12:26] indigestion
[1:12:29] we're going to realize something's wrong
[1:12:32] with the diet
[1:12:34] you know i i don't know i just don't set
[1:12:37] well i just i i find myself you know i
[1:12:39] come home with this irritation and
[1:12:42] upset stomach and i'm struggling and i'm
[1:12:45] tormented i'm troubled and the the only
[1:12:48] satisfaction i can find the only piece
[1:12:50] the only answers is is in the bible
[1:12:53] and in the message
[1:12:55] so i started eating in the word more i
[1:12:57] started reading my bible i started
[1:12:58] listening to the message more
[1:13:01] and the more i listen the more apparent
[1:13:06] the deviation became
[1:13:09] and i began to realize i'm gonna have to
[1:13:10] choose one or the other
[1:13:13] i'm gonna either have to stay with the
[1:13:15] word of god or i'm gonna have to stay
[1:13:17] with a group
[1:13:19] with people i love with the church i
[1:13:21] love with a ministry i love but i got to
[1:13:23] make a decision here
[1:13:25] and so my wife and i god moved us away
[1:13:28] from this particular assembly this
[1:13:30] particular church so it affected this
[1:13:32] friendship
[1:13:36] because at the time god had not yet
[1:13:40] opened their understanding
[1:13:42] or to to the same way he had shown and
[1:13:45] friends this is what you have to realize
[1:13:47] god operates
[1:13:49] on different time frames
[1:13:52] with his people
[1:13:53] everybody don't see it at the same time
[1:13:56] everybody don't move at the same time
[1:13:59] god leads his children individually
[1:14:03] and severally as he will he's got a
[1:14:06] different times times a timeline for
[1:14:10] each person
[1:14:12] so it separated our friendship
[1:14:14] now i'm going to tell you this if i had
[1:14:17] compromised
[1:14:19] my views or my stand
[1:14:21] on the word
[1:14:23] i would not have a friendship today
[1:14:28] but the word of god
[1:14:30] was an absolute
[1:14:33] to my wife and i and to my brother and
[1:14:36] his wife
[1:14:37] and because we both stayed our love for
[1:14:41] god and our love for his word never
[1:14:44] wavered
[1:14:45] eventually god opened the understanding
[1:14:48] of the other party and they too
[1:14:52] began to see
[1:14:55] and so it brought us back together
[1:14:59] in a relationship
[1:15:01] that was better
[1:15:03] than before
[1:15:05] [Applause]
[1:15:07] oh my
[1:15:08] so what i'm telling you tonight don't
[1:15:10] compromise
[1:15:11] you cannot compromise if you have to
[1:15:13] compromise to maintain a friendship it
[1:15:16] didn't come from god
[1:15:18] if you have to compromise the word to
[1:15:20] maintain a marriage it didn't come from
[1:15:21] god
[1:15:23] whatsoever god hath joined together
[1:15:27] let not man put asunder
[1:15:31] and many men great men great ministries
[1:15:34] anointed ministries have attacked you by
[1:15:38] attacking the word
[1:15:44] they didn't attack brother branham they
[1:15:46] attacked you
[1:15:49] brother branham has sealed his testimony
[1:15:52] and is divinely vindicated of god
[1:15:55] and now you are the witness
[1:15:58] now your life
[1:16:00] is on trial
[1:16:01] and you are the witness you are the one
[1:16:04] that the devil attacked
[1:16:06] when this message was attacked
[1:16:08] because it's your identity
[1:16:11] it's who you are
[1:16:13] and so they were never attacking brother
[1:16:15] branham or his teachings they were
[1:16:17] attacking the vindication
[1:16:28] and had you compromised
[1:16:31] had you compromised
[1:16:33] you would have given up
[1:16:35] your identity
[1:16:37] you would have had surrendered
[1:16:39] your divine your deity
[1:16:46] and god won't let you do it
[1:16:50] he won't let you do it
[1:16:52] why because it is his declaration
[1:16:56] and god won't let his word fail
[1:16:59] it is his declaration that he's going to
[1:17:01] have a bride
[1:17:03] out of laodicea
[1:17:05] and he staked his reputation
[1:17:09] on you
[1:17:10] [Applause]
[1:17:12] so he will reinforce his own word
[1:17:17] by reinforcing your faith
[1:17:20] in the unfailing body word of the son of
[1:17:23] man you're not feeding on a man his
[1:17:25] words will fail
[1:17:26] we're feeding on the body word of the of
[1:17:29] man
[1:17:30] amen
[1:17:31] praise god it's
[1:17:34] it's our diet
[1:17:37] if the devil wanted to know the secret
[1:17:40] the secret is in two things
[1:17:42] our genetics
[1:17:44] and the diet
[1:17:47] i'm just going to say this tonight
[1:17:49] you can be muhammad ali's birth son
[1:17:52] birth daughter you can be michael
[1:17:54] jackson's direct i send it you can be
[1:17:57] the descendant of a world champion with
[1:17:59] all the muscles all the bone density all
[1:18:03] the structure all the potentials
[1:18:05] of a champion
[1:18:07] but your diet
[1:18:10] will determine if those potentials are
[1:18:13] ever realized or exercised in you
[1:18:20] hello church
[1:18:21] oh brother tim we're the bride of jesus
[1:18:23] christ

[1:18:43] the potentials

[1:18:50] weakening your testimony amen and you
[1:18:52] are the weakest excuse amen you're a
[1:18:55] poor excuse for a hypocrite much less a
[1:18:58] christian because you've been feeding on
[1:19:00] something that is not conducive
[1:19:03] to championship performance
[1:19:07] amen
[1:19:08] if you're going to get raptured out of
[1:19:09] here you better get yourself into the
[1:19:12] word of god
[1:19:14] you better wake up in the morning and
[1:19:15] pray
[1:19:16] and read your bible and study this

[1:19:21] to limit me you're not going to hinder

[1:20:15] pray and read your bible every day
[1:20:19] amen you've got the you've got the
[1:20:20] genetics
[1:20:22] but you've got to have the diet and the
[1:20:24] exercise
[1:20:25] to unleash
[1:20:27] the potentials
[1:20:29] amen
[1:20:31] i tell you muhammad ali didn't become a
[1:20:33] world champion eating twinkies
[1:20:37] he had to drink water and eat oatmeal
[1:20:40] and he had to work out and he he had he
[1:20:42] had a war
[1:20:43] he had to exercise he had to go work out
[1:20:45] every day he was a world champion but he
[1:20:47] didn't rest on his laurels
[1:20:50] he didn't rest amen on his history
[1:20:53] he didn't rest on the hero he used to be
[1:20:56] and you can't either
[1:20:58] what god did 20 years ago
[1:21:01] it's wonderful as a memory but you need
[1:21:04] a real experience tonight
[1:21:07] oh my
[1:21:09] praise god praise god
[1:21:13] better than before
[1:21:16] jeremiah 29 says verse 10 says thus
[1:21:19] saith the lord after 70 years be
[1:21:21] accomplished at babylon
[1:21:23] i will visit you
[1:21:24] and perform my word to you and causing
[1:21:29] you to return to this place
[1:21:32] for i know the thoughts
[1:21:34] that i think
[1:21:35] toward you
[1:21:37] saith the lord thoughts of peace and not
[1:21:40] of evil to give you an expected in
[1:21:44] then shall ye call upon me and you shall
[1:21:47] go and pray unto me and i will hearken
[1:21:49] unto you and you shall seek me and find
[1:21:51] me when you search for me with all
[1:21:57] a double l all of your heart
[1:22:00] you know our problem with today we want
[1:22:02] to make god work on our schedule
[1:22:07] we're living in such a structured world
[1:22:09] you know
[1:22:10] people don't want to come to church
[1:22:11] anymore
[1:22:13] they want to have virtual meetings
[1:22:15] i want to tell you what god wants to
[1:22:16] meet you
[1:22:18] but the bible says forsaking not the
[1:22:20] assembling of yourselves together as the
[1:22:23] matter of some is
[1:22:25] the more so as you see that they
[1:22:26] approach you
[1:22:28] i for one believe in coming to the house
[1:22:30] of god
[1:22:32] and worshiping shoulder to shoulder
[1:22:35] elbow to elbow with your brother and
[1:22:38] your sister and working out your
[1:22:40] differences
[1:22:45] and coming to foot washing and communion
[1:22:48] and saying brother please forgive me
[1:22:50] sister please you know some i'm just
[1:22:52] going to preach it for a minute but
[1:22:53] simba there's one thing i can't stand
[1:22:56] and that's a blanket apology
[1:22:59] somebody come up to you
[1:23:01] they done stumped your toes stabbed you
[1:23:03] in the back and bruised your head and
[1:23:05] say brother sister please forgive me
[1:23:08] if i've ever done anything
[1:23:11] to offend you come on friend
[1:23:15] that ain't an apology
[1:23:17] that ain't repentance and that ain't god
[1:23:20] you know what you
[1:23:22] you know what you said why don't you
[1:23:24] expose that devil
[1:23:26] and really repent and say i know i said
[1:23:28] it i know i did it it was evil in my
[1:23:31] heart and brother and sister may god
[1:23:33] forgive me for it and i want to make
[1:23:35] recompense
[1:23:36] i want reconciliation
[1:23:39] i don't want you just to forgive me i
[1:23:40] want to make the wrong right i want you
[1:23:43] to know that i've been changed
[1:23:45] friends repentance is not repentance
[1:23:48] it's turning from your old ways and your
[1:23:52] old habits and saying god has changed my
[1:23:56] heart god has changed my life and i'm a
[1:23:58] new person
[1:24:01] amen
[1:24:02] repentance is willing to demonstrate the
[1:24:05] difference
[1:24:07] not repeat the same old habits that
[1:24:09] ain't repentance friends
[1:24:12] that ain't god
[1:24:13] when god does it everybody's going to
[1:24:16] know there's been a change
[1:24:17] and you're going to know there's been
[1:24:19] when god does it
[1:24:21] you'll know the devil did it
[1:24:24] and you'll put the blame and the shame
[1:24:25] on him
[1:24:27] and you can confess
[1:24:29] your faults
[1:24:30] one to another
[1:24:32] i know what i said
[1:24:34] i know what i did i'm making full
[1:24:36] acknowledgement
[1:24:38] of my sin
[1:24:40] and i'm asking for genuine
[1:24:43] forgiveness
[1:24:46] you'll get somewhere with god
[1:24:48] when you do that
[1:24:50] amen that was free
[1:24:52] but it's the truth
[1:24:56] amen that blanket apology is going to
[1:24:59] burn in the fiery furnace one day along
[1:25:01] with the devil because it's just a
[1:25:03] religious covering
[1:25:05] and you'll pull that blanket out every
[1:25:07] time you know you've done wrong just so
[1:25:09] you can walk through the line
[1:25:11] get over that friend get right with god
[1:25:14] get on your knees in front of an altar
[1:25:16] and let old-fashioned repentance change
[1:25:18] your heart change your life let the
[1:25:20] tears of repentance come out your eyes
[1:25:22] and go to your neighbor and make your
[1:25:24] wrongs right
[1:25:25] in the name of the lord
[1:25:27] that's the reason you ain't got victory
[1:25:30] that's the reason the devil don't bow to
[1:25:31] you that's the reason you have no
[1:25:33] overcoming power it's because the devil
[1:25:35] has got control over you
[1:25:38] amen he knows he can't kill you
[1:25:42] the devil cannot destroy you but he
[1:25:44] wants to marginalize you
[1:25:47] he wants to move you to the middle
[1:25:50] where you're just floating along
[1:25:52] just a church member
[1:25:54] friend if all you're going to be as a
[1:25:55] church member you might as well be a
[1:25:57] roman catholic
[1:25:59] you might as well be in anyone
[1:26:02] [Music]
[1:26:04] because being in a church don't make you
[1:26:06] a christian
[1:26:07] any more than being in a garage makes
[1:26:09] you an automobile
[1:26:11] the church don't save you the baptism of
[1:26:14] the holy ghost is what saves you and
[1:26:16] that's the only ticket that's getting on
[1:26:19] the plane
[1:26:20] is a token ticket not your association
[1:26:23] not your mama not your daddy not your
[1:26:25] history not your knowledge
[1:26:28] hey
[1:26:29] man
[1:26:30] it's the old time holy spirit and the
[1:26:33] devil won't come here that's the reason
[1:26:35] people fear it but it's good enough for
[1:26:37] me brother kelly
[1:26:41] oh my
[1:26:45] amen
[1:26:47] [Music]
[1:26:48] peter said in his epistle
[1:26:51] you're a chosen generation
[1:26:53] a royal priesthood an holy nation of
[1:26:56] peculiar people that you should show
[1:26:58] forth
[1:26:59] the praises of him
[1:27:01] who hath called you
[1:27:03] out
[1:27:05] out of
[1:27:06] darkness
[1:27:08] into
[1:27:10] his
[1:27:11] glorious
[1:27:12] light
[1:27:13] [Music]
[1:27:14] oh my
[1:27:16] arise shine forth thy light
[1:27:18] is come and the glory of the lord
[1:27:22] is risen upon
[1:27:25] thee
[1:27:27] years ago when i was just a child we
[1:27:29] went to a church and there was a man
[1:27:31] there who had come and been converted
[1:27:34] out of a prison
[1:27:36] he was a prisoner he was in the penal
[1:27:39] system
[1:27:40] you know
[1:27:40] prison system and he got saved and he
[1:27:43] really got saved i i tell this story
[1:27:44] when i was a boy this brother he would
[1:27:46] witness he worked in the prisons and he
[1:27:48] would bring in these these men and and
[1:27:50] they'd get a pass
[1:27:52] they'd come to church with him
[1:27:53] one night they heard something you had
[1:27:55] three or four guys came they heard
[1:27:56] something they didn't like
[1:27:58] they got him walked out they unscrewed
[1:28:00] the light bulbs
[1:28:02] and the porch you know where we all
[1:28:04] walked outside and fellowship they
[1:28:05] unscrewed the light bulbs
[1:28:07] they took one man he had a he had a
[1:28:08] toyota uh
[1:28:10] i believe it was a tercel it was a
[1:28:12] station wagon five door
[1:28:14] and they picked his car up
[1:28:18] and turned it sideways
[1:28:20] in the parking space
[1:28:22] now i'd venture to say those men never
[1:28:24] got to go to church on a pass again
[1:28:31] that was the end of them getting a a
[1:28:33] pass to come true they weren't getting
[1:28:35] changed but this man got changed
[1:28:38] god saved him uh you you know who i'm
[1:28:40] talking about sister destiny but you may
[1:28:42] not know at the moment but you've met
[1:28:44] him i'm sure he was neighbors
[1:28:46] he married
[1:28:48] he married a sister within the church
[1:28:51] and she was a believer
[1:28:53] and brother
[1:28:55] after she married him
[1:28:57] when she came to church you could smell
[1:28:59] her before you saw her
[1:29:02] she wore the nicest perfumes
[1:29:05] i mean not loud not
[1:29:07] obnoxious
[1:29:09] beautiful
[1:29:11] odors
[1:29:12] and wore beautiful dresses
[1:29:16] he
[1:29:17] still had the resemblance
[1:29:19] of a prisoner he was missing he had
[1:29:21] shaved they had shaved off an eyebrow he
[1:29:24] bore the mark of a prisoner
[1:29:27] but he let his glory
[1:29:31] express
[1:29:33] in her
[1:29:36] because he knew the value
[1:29:39] of having a godly wife
[1:29:42] and he would bestow upon her
[1:29:44] these beautiful clothes i mean beautiful
[1:29:47] dresses flowing very modest all these
[1:29:49] things it was never was never anything
[1:29:52] to to
[1:29:53] bring attention to her but what it was
[1:29:56] showing
[1:29:57] was what he had become
[1:30:01] as her husband
[1:30:03] and as her provider
[1:30:05] and as her protector
[1:30:07] and as her guardian he
[1:30:10] did not take her for granted
[1:30:12] he respected
[1:30:14] having a godly wife
[1:30:16] and it didn't take anything away from
[1:30:18] him for her
[1:30:21] to grab the attention
[1:30:23] because any attention she was getting
[1:30:35] and had it not been for his background
[1:30:37] had it not been for his past and she was
[1:30:40] raised poor i mean she she was raised in
[1:30:43] a big family a bunch of kids she was one
[1:30:45] of the older children she
[1:30:46] you know relatively poor
[1:30:48] but when she married him
[1:30:51] she was no longer poor
[1:30:52] she was no longer a pauper
[1:30:55] everything she had need of
[1:30:58] he provided for it and you know
[1:31:00] something
[1:31:01] she never had to say a word
[1:31:04] every man knew
[1:31:06] she was taken
[1:31:11] every man knew
[1:31:13] she is off
[1:31:15] limits
[1:31:17] she's not marketing herself
[1:31:20] for husband number two
[1:31:22] or for boyfriend number three or for
[1:31:24] another lover she is taken
[1:31:27] [Music]
[1:31:28] even if he's 10 feet away from her she
[1:31:31] is under his protection
[1:31:33] she is under his guardianship she is
[1:31:35] under his watch
[1:31:38] he gave a message
[1:31:41] through her
[1:31:42] that was a non-verbal communication
[1:31:47] i am married to somebody stronger than
[1:31:50] you
[1:31:51] i'm married to somebody richer than you
[1:31:53] i'm married to somebody more powerful
[1:31:55] than you no matter what your mind might
[1:31:57] be thinking no matter what your interest
[1:31:59] may be hands off
[1:32:02] and that's what i want to tell the devil
[1:32:04] tonight
[1:32:05] hands off devil
[1:32:08] i'm not in the market for another
[1:32:10] message

[1:32:13] ministry i'm not looking for another
[1:32:15] groom or another husband i'm taken
[1:32:19] [Applause]
[1:32:20] hands off devil
[1:32:22] by his stripes
[1:32:24] i am healed hands off devil
[1:32:28] many are the afflictions of the
[1:32:29] righteous but the lord god delivereth

[1:32:38] glory of god look at me
[1:32:41] look at my life look at my testimony
[1:32:44] look at where god brought me from to
[1:32:46] where i am today
[1:32:48] she can walk into the room
[1:32:52] and the atmosphere changed
[1:32:54] she could walk into a setting and the
[1:32:57] atmosphere changed because there was
[1:32:59] peace
[1:33:00] there was tranquility
[1:33:02] there was power she had a command
[1:33:05] over the room
[1:33:07] because she was married
[1:33:08] [Music]

[1:35:18] the word what eve turned down
[1:35:20] he comes back
[1:35:22] and we accept
[1:35:25] now you know why the devil was trying to
[1:35:26] talk you out of believing this message
[1:35:29] he wanted to marginalize
[1:35:32] who you are
[1:35:34] and put you in a state of spiritual
[1:35:36] amnesia
[1:35:37] because he cannot destroy you and
[1:35:39] actually cannot defeat you
[1:35:41] but he can neutralize you
[1:35:44] by dimming your view
[1:35:46] an understanding
[1:35:48] of who you are
[1:35:50] see that hybrid condition again just
[1:35:52] exactly what he'd done if he told eve
[1:35:53] don't you do this don't you do that and
[1:35:55] you can do this and that see legalism
[1:35:58] legalism how many have ever tried to
[1:36:00] tell you this message is legalism
[1:36:02] it's not legalism
[1:36:04] it's a love letter
[1:36:07] but
[1:36:08] to those who are not predestinated
[1:36:10] it looks like legalism
[1:36:12] relationship
[1:36:14] makes the difference
[1:36:17] oh satan said oh you know but she turned
[1:36:19] around listen to him but the even the
[1:36:20] last day is not going to do it
[1:36:23] because she's predestinated
[1:36:25] not to do it
[1:36:27] yes sir god's going to do it
[1:36:30] he knows he'll have it he said his
[1:36:34] church would be there without spot or
[1:36:37] wrinkle she is going to stand there in
[1:36:40] the splendor of him
[1:36:43] his word
[1:36:44] may manifest
[1:36:46] as a brother stephen comes there was a
[1:36:48] boy one time you know he got lifted up
[1:36:50] and pride and he said i'm going to go
[1:36:52] demand
[1:36:55] my inheritance
[1:36:56] i'm going to cash out
[1:36:58] early
[1:37:00] and i'm going to go
[1:37:01] live
[1:37:02] the way of the world
[1:37:05] and it was a dead-end street
[1:37:08] only days later he was penniless
[1:37:11] friendless
[1:37:12] and slopping the hogs
[1:37:15] hoping to get a bite
[1:37:17] of what he was feeding to them
[1:37:21] sometime went by
[1:37:23] and one day
[1:37:24] the bible says
[1:37:26] he came
[1:37:28] to himself
[1:37:32] he said you know what i may be in a
[1:37:33] different place
[1:37:36] i may be penniless
[1:37:39] i may have a different appearance
[1:37:42] i may have a trashed
[1:37:44] reputation
[1:37:46] but one thing has not changed
[1:37:51] i am still
[1:37:53] still
[1:37:54] my father's son
[1:37:59] i think i'll go home
[1:38:03] and the closer he walked to home
[1:38:07] the more he grew
[1:38:10] into the realization
[1:38:12] of who he was
[1:38:13] and then when his father saw him coming
[1:38:17] he didn't send him through a reform
[1:38:19] school
[1:38:21] he didn't send him through a three-step
[1:38:23] program
[1:38:24] he didn't send them through penance
[1:38:27] or some program
[1:38:29] to reprove himself as a son
[1:38:33] he said kill the fatted calf
[1:38:35] bring the finest garment
[1:38:38] give him the same
[1:38:41] as he had before
[1:38:44] because he's still
[1:38:46] my
[1:38:47] son
[1:38:49] his value was never measured on a bank
[1:38:51] statement
[1:38:53] his value was never measured and how
[1:38:55] many facebook friends
[1:38:57] he had his value is in whose son he is
[1:39:02] and when he recognized it the father
[1:39:05] ratified it
[1:39:06] welcomed him and killed the fatted calf
[1:39:08] and said my son has come home again and
[1:39:12] don't you know there was a bond
[1:39:15] between that boy
[1:39:17] and his dad
[1:39:18] that was better
[1:39:21] than before
[1:39:23] you know something
[1:39:26] i left this out and i apologize for
[1:39:28] going so long
[1:39:30] but if you are a prophetic class of
[1:39:32] people
[1:39:34] then you have a prophetic attribute in
[1:39:36] you
[1:39:38] god wanted to restore those bones
[1:39:41] back to everything they were before and
[1:39:44] more
[1:39:46] but he needed somebody
[1:39:49] to speak
[1:39:51] his desire
[1:39:54] god ain't waiting on brother brethren to
[1:39:56] come back
[1:39:57] god's not waiting on an eighth messenger
[1:39:59] to write so
[1:40:00] god's not waiting on some great
[1:40:02] fantastic ministry
[1:40:04] god's waiting on you
[1:40:07] to realize
[1:40:08] the power of his desire expressed
[1:40:11] through his spoken word and let that
[1:40:13] word speak through you
[1:40:16] you speak to your situation
[1:40:20] you speak to the mountain you speak to
[1:40:23] the condition
[1:40:24] the word of god is nigh unto thee even
[1:40:26] in thy mouth if you're a prophetic class
[1:40:29] of people then you are echoing and i
[1:40:31] wanted to get to that quote where he
[1:40:32] talks about it was echoed you can bring
[1:40:34] it later but steve buddy but brother
[1:40:36] ben's i'll
[1:40:37] is it okay if i read this i i know it's
[1:40:40] i know it's 905 but it's later than we
[1:40:42] think
[1:40:43] and i know what the devil hates he hates
[1:40:46] this word
[1:40:47] so i'm gonna give him one more black eye
[1:40:49] amen
[1:40:51] praise the lord why i'm against
[1:40:54] organized religion
[1:40:56] the holy spirit today the manifestation
[1:40:58] of the holy spirit is that angel trying
[1:41:01] to get the people back to the word
[1:41:04] because the holy spirit will only
[1:41:07] vindicate the word
[1:41:10] it can't vindicate dogma there's no life
[1:41:13] in him
[1:41:14] he's life
[1:41:16] notice the laodicean church age had
[1:41:17] denied and rejected them and they put
[1:41:19] them on the outside now this angel is
[1:41:21] the last messenger before the coming of
[1:41:24] christ in the 19th chapter of revelation
[1:41:26] the messenger's voice if we notice when
[1:41:29] he gave his voice on the earth there was
[1:41:32] a voice that echoed in heaven
[1:41:34] fourth verse if you want to read it
[1:41:36] alright fourth verse 19th chapter the
[1:41:38] messenger on the earth was so inclined
[1:41:41] with god
[1:41:43] until when he spoken on the earth
[1:41:46] god echoed the same thing
[1:41:49] out of heaven
[1:41:51] what is that fourth birth translation
[1:41:53] what does it mean god's
[1:41:55] voice speaking to his predestinated
[1:41:58] people saying come out
[1:42:01] of her
[1:42:03] just exactly what the voice was he's got
[1:42:05] people all out there all throughout all
[1:42:07] out through babylon come out of her that
[1:42:09] you be not partakers of his sins now we
[1:42:11] always put this in denominations
[1:42:14] but it ain't in denominations
[1:42:17] it's in the denominational spirits
[1:42:20] that reside right within
[1:42:23] so-called message churches
[1:42:27] [Music]
[1:42:29] it's denominational spirits
[1:42:31] when men try to preserve a move of god
[1:42:34] they paralyze
[1:42:36] they embalm
[1:42:38] the move of god by trying to preserve
[1:42:40] they make it all about what god did
[1:42:42] friend it's not about what god did
[1:42:44] it's about what god's doing
[1:42:48] and as soon as they build walls and
[1:42:49] denominate around it the pillar fire
[1:42:50] moves right on and the bride follows
[1:42:52] along with
[1:42:53] because it's who she is
[1:42:56] yes sir out of that dogmas and creates
[1:42:58] to the word made spirit in life notice
[1:43:00] the 19th chapter is the next after these
[1:43:03] things did you notice here in the 19th
[1:43:05] chapter after these things watch what
[1:43:07] after what after the message of come out
[1:43:11] of her after these things watched is the
[1:43:14] shout
[1:43:15] of the bride saints
[1:43:22] he didn't say the prophet
[1:43:24] he said the bride saints
[1:43:27] this the shout of the bride saints
[1:43:30] with the bridegroom going to the
[1:43:33] marriage of the lamb
[1:43:37] it's no longer two voices it's one voice
[1:43:42] oh
[1:43:43] and he is echoing it whatsoever you bind
[1:43:46] on earth abide in heaven whatsoever you
[1:43:48] loose on earth i'll loose in heaven
[1:43:50] we've arrived we're here
[1:43:53] now is he going to speak

[1:43:58] speak to the sickness speak to the
[1:44:01] situation in your whole in your family

[1:44:05] daughter of god i'm standing here on the
[1:44:07] word of god and i'm saying come back
[1:44:10] come back bones

[1:44:18] and don't be what you are before be
[1:44:21] better
[1:44:22] be better than what you were before
[1:44:25] oh
[1:44:26] my god
[1:44:30] come out of babylon come out of unbelief
[1:44:33] come out of anything
[1:44:35] any knowledge
[1:44:37] that exalts itself
[1:44:39] is the word of god
[1:44:41] give a key of g
[1:44:44] give me your hand

[1:45:02] for whatever we bind on earth
[1:45:07] shall be bound in heaven
