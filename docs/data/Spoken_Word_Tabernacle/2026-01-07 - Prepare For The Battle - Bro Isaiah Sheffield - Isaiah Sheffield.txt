So, we're going to invite Sister Lily. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I do have a quick testimony if that's okay, too. &gt;&gt; Yes. Um, I gave a testimony I think in September that um, I owed about $8,000 after my surgery and the Lord completely just wiped it clean from the hospital. Um, just a little update, I still owed about $700 to my anesthesiologist from the surgery and I applied for financial assistance for that as well and I'd already they'd already sent me to collections. So, I thought, well, it's too late to apply for financial assistance, but if the Lord took care of 8,000, like what's 700? So, uh, I applied for it late and I never it it took a few months and I hadn't heard back and I was still receiving collection notices. So, I just I just ignored them. Um, and I was talking to my sister-in-law about it yesterday because she owes money to her hospital from her birth. And I was telling her, you know, if the Lord for could forgive my 8,000, he can do it for you. And I'm still waiting for this 700, but I know he's going to take care of it. And I was at work today and I got a call and I missed it. And when I listened to the voicemail, it was from the anesthesiologist that they forgave the 700%. So I don't owe a single penny at all from my surgery. So that was 100% of my surgery debt. Glor. to come. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. is easy when you're up on the mountain and you've got peace of mind like you've never known. But things change when you're down in the valley. Don't lose faith. For you're never alone. For the God in the mountain is still God in the valley. When things go wrong, he'll make them right. And the God of the good times, he's still God in the bad times. And the God of the day is still God in the night. You talk of faith when you're up on the mountain. The talk comes so easy. life at his best. Now it's down in the valley of trials and temptations. That's where you'll face put to the test. God on the mountain is still God in the valley when things go wrong. Oh, he'll make them right. Oh, the God of the good times, he's still God in the bad times. The God of the dead is still God in you. Oh, for the God of the mountain is still God in the valleyies when things go wrong. Oh, he'll make them cry. God of the good times is still God in the bad times and the God of the days is still God in the night. Oh, if it had not been for the Lord on my side, tell me where would I be? Where would I be if it had not been for the Lord on my side? Tell me, where would I be? Where would I be? &gt;&gt; Amen. If it had been the Lord on our side, where would I be? Amen and amen. Amen. Amen. So, we just want to take this song. Amen. And then invite brother Steven. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I believe God. Believe God. And shall be done. I believe God. Oh, I believe God ever shall be I believe I believe one more time. I believe I believe you and it shall be done. I believe I believe. If you believe it, give him a big clap offering. Praise God. Sister Lily, I thought the song was continuing and suddenly I'm like, &gt;&gt; keep moving. It's a wonderful, wonderful, wonderful song. Amen. &gt;&gt; The God of the mountain is not just the God of the mountain. &gt;&gt; He's also the God of the valley. &gt;&gt; In other words, there is no circumstance where God cannot reach. every circumstances whether it's bad tight whatever you call it God is specialized in every circumstances in your life amen we greet you all in the precious name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ both visible and invisible audience amen here God bless you I see sister Michaela she's right there Leah God bless you brother David and the blessing on the Hey, God bless you. Good to see you, Sister Mary, Big Brian, Sister Mayor, my friend right there. God bless you. Everybody, welcome. We don't have visitors. We got family member. Welcome to Spoken Word Tabernacle. Amen. So, feel free to shout, to cry, to jump, whatever the Holy Spirit want you to do, do it. You are home. I told brother Isaiah, I say this is your second home. Amen. &gt;&gt; So, feel at home. Glory. Glory to God. Everybody clear on the son of man. &gt;&gt; We clear now &gt;&gt; or somebody still uh uh under the effect of effect of the medication because I still have more to to give. So if you got the medication, we move on. If you still need more, there is a backup that is already in store. Amen. If you understand what we preach, you will understand the scripture. You will understand why Paul come to remove the Hebrew from the law. And Paul himself look at the Jews because they were Pharisee. They could not understand his move. When Timothy was converted, he took Timothy and circumcised him. &gt;&gt; You know it's in the Bible. &gt;&gt; Do you know? And the Bible say he did it because of the Jews. &gt;&gt; Because according to them, you must be circumcised. And when the Jews brought that doctrine to the Galatian, &gt;&gt; Paul came and the Galatian want to circumcise themselves. Paul came. He say, "Who have be with you?" &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The same prophet that went and circumcised somebody &gt;&gt; and we got even the certificate from the hospital. &gt;&gt; We got the proof we were there. We took some pictures to make sure everybody knows Paul circumcised somebody. He's telling the Galatian, he say, "Who have circumcised you?" I mean, who have bewitch you? In other words, trying to get circumcision, he's calling that a witchcraft. &gt;&gt; You need to understand the scripture very well. And Paul was a prophet &gt;&gt; and he was another son of man ministry. &gt;&gt; Amen. He went to Jerusalem and he got into a vow and he he went and shaved himself. But what is going on with you? &gt;&gt; You say come out from the law. &gt;&gt; Now you yourself going to shave yourself. If you follow him, you back in trouble. &gt;&gt; Jesus say offense must come. &gt;&gt; Do you know that? &gt;&gt; He say but wo &gt;&gt; the person that is going to bring the offense. It's uh sword that have that cut going and cut coming. Behold in Zion I lay a stone. &gt;&gt; The stone can either fall on you and crush you or you fall on the stone. All of that the same stone bring deliverance and the same stone take somebody to hell. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So be careful when you're reading the Son of Man ministry. Amen. &gt;&gt; Pray God for revelation. That's why brother Brandham say I can never overemphasize the need of a revelation for the believer. When you read before you read the Bible, pray God you say, "Open the eyes of my heart." Lord, when I'm listening to the message, let me really catch the vision. Catch the revelation of what your prophet is really saying. And then you will begin to understand that, "Oh, now I see what the Lord is saying." Amen. Amen. It looks like the prayer on Tuesday is taking care of all the request. &gt;&gt; The prayer is wiping everything and we get to church, there's no more request because on Tuesday prayer, everything was clear. Sister Lily, you got a testimony coming. Everything is cleaning up. I was praying. Everybody who's in financial trouble in this church, you going to come out. &gt;&gt; You don't have to say amen. I will believe for you. Amen. Brother Brandham say it was the faith of Abraham that put the baby in Sarah. So even if you don't want to believe, I will believe for you. I will stand as a pastor and believe for you for God to free you completely so the children of God can be free. Amen. &gt;&gt; And we want to hear some great testimony moving on in every aspect of our life. Amen. So welcome to our convention on Wednesday. It's our convention and we got brother Michael Sheffield. Finally, we caught him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He will be ministering for us. And if you look at him, this is a soldier. He got an injury on his foot. He's still wearing the stuff on the foot, but he's coming to preach with it. I said, "This is a soldier right there in the army. So, let's pull on the gift of the Lord." I told him, "He's home. He's going to preach like home." And let pull on the gift of the Lord. And we hear what the Holy Spirit will tell us tonight. Amen. Forever. Only believe. Holy believe. Oh believe. All things are possible. All living. Yes sir. All things. Let's sing it again to see all things are possible if we All be Amen. &gt;&gt; Is that your testimony this evening? Only believe, all things are possible. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. I appreciate the opportunity to be with you this evening. It's uh certainly a privilege and an honor and came down with brother Seth a few months ago and certainly enjoyed the service and enjoyed the fellowship and it's just good to good to be with you and uh I'll share just a quick testimony here with he mentioned my my foot. So about two months ago um I fell off a wall. while I was at work and I was working, I fell 14 foot and hit the concrete and landed directly on my foot and fell to my side and dislocated my shoulder. And um by God's grace that that was that was all it was. And uh I I'm very very thankful in the in the time when it happened, I realized that that God was merciful and it could have been a lot worse. But as time has went on and hearing other people talking about falls and hearing hearing all kinds of stories, people have fallen a lot less distance and and fallen on dirt and got hurt a lot worse than I did. And so God was really really watching out for me. When I actually when I went to the hospital, they kept wanting to check my head. They kept thinking that they they I don't know how many times they asked me, "Are you sure you didn't hit your head?" You had to have hit your head just because fall from that distance. They thought, you know, surely I would have hit my head. And I didn't hit my head. Actually, the the trusses, it was trusses that fell and knocked me off a wall. And they actually got pinned up above me. And they stayed about six feet off the ground right where I hit the concrete or they would have fallen directly on me. So God was really merciful. And here in about two weeks, I'll come out of the boot. And Amen. Appreciate it. He's He's still watching over us even no matter what what we are, where we are, no matter what's going on, he's got his hand in our lives. So, &gt;&gt; if we will, let's let's bow our head this this evening. &gt;&gt; Dear heavenly father, Lord, we come before you this evening, Lord. Just Lord, just wanting to thank you, Lord, for what an opportunity, Lord. What a privilege you've given us, Lord, that we could come together, Lord, on a on a Wednesday evening, Father, that you would you would put a a desire in each heart, Father, that that we would leave, Lord, the the busy lives, no doubt, Lord, the the different obligations we would have, but Father, you would draw us together, Lord, with saints of like, precious faith. Father, Lord, I don't believe that each one came to see one another. But, Lord, I believe that each person came this evening, Lord, with a desire, Lord, to hear from you. Lord, they came with a desire to pull up to the the communion table with you this evening and they would just begin to fellowship around your word, Father. Lord, I ask that you would just come down in this service, Father. Lord, as we've we've sung your psalms, Lord, we've invited you here, Lord. We've prepared an atmosphere, Lord. Lord, WE WANT YOU TO FEEL WELCOME AMONGST us this evening, Lord. You see each and every heart, Lord, you see each and every life that's in here, Lord. Lord, before the foundation of the world, Lord, I believe THAT YOU SAW THIS SERVICE, LORD. But I believe that you saw each person that would be sitting here, Lord. You saw the needs that WOULD BE ON THEIR LIFE, FATHER. You saw the battles they would be going through, LORD. LORD, NOT ONLY DID YOU SEE THE BATTLES THEY'RE going through, Lord, but you see the battles that are up in front of them, Lord. You see the battles they're going to face tomorrow when they walk into work, LORD. YOU SEE THE BATTLES AND HOW THE ENEMY IS GOING TO TRY TO ATTACK them at later this week or next week. And Lord, I'm just I believe, Lord, I'm simple enough to believe, Lord, that you could come down, Lord, through this service and you could begin to speak the things, Lord, that we would need to hear, Father, even when we don't know what we need to hear, Father. Even when we don't realize it, but Lord, YOU KNOW EXACTLY WHAT WE NEED to hear, LORD. YOU KNOW EXACTLY WHAT to do to prepare US FOR A LOT WHAT LAYS IN FRONT OF US. SO, FATHER, LORD, I just ask that you would take control of this service. Lord, would you move me out of the way, Father? Let me step aside that you can speak through me this evening. They didn't come to hear me, Lord. They came to hear you this evening. Father, I ask that you would just have all the preeminence, Lord, and receive all the glory and honor this evening, Lord. We give the service into your hands, Lord, asking that you would come down, Lord, and walk the aisles and speak to every heart. Father, we give it into your hands this evening. In Jesus name we pray. Amen and amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If you will turn in your your Bibles to Ephesians 6. Just a real simple thought this evening, but &gt;&gt; I believe if &gt;&gt; you pull on the word sir &gt;&gt; and uh God will have his way this evening. &gt;&gt; Ephesians 6 &gt;&gt; and 10. If I take a title this evening, I'll say prepare for the battle. &gt;&gt; Prepare for the battle. &gt;&gt; Ephesians 6 and 10. &gt;&gt; Finally, my brethren, &gt;&gt; be strong in the Lord and in the power of his might. Put on the whole armor of God, that ye may be able to stand against the ws of the devil. &gt;&gt; For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, and against powers, and against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places. Wherefore take unto you the whole armor of God, that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, &gt;&gt; to stand. Stand therefore, having your loins gird about with truth, and having on the breastplate of the righteousness, and and your feet shaw with the preparation of the gospel of peace, above all, taking the shield of faith, wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked, and take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the spirit, which is the word of God. &gt;&gt; May the Lord add a blessing to the reading of the word. You can have your seats this evening. &gt;&gt; Amen. What a what a powerful section of scripture here that's been given to us. And as I I begin to approach this s thought on preparing for the battle or prepare for the battle, we recognize that in our daily walk that that every day we we walk into a battle that that this life is not a flowery bed of ease. It's not it's not just laid out in front of us. You know, you know that brother Brandham said, you know, God didn't just push us through one end of a tube and push us out the other end. No, but there's there's a preparation that has to take place. There's a there's a battle that we're going to face every day. And and some days it's small battles, some days it's large battles, but we recognize that you're either in the midst of a trial. You're coming out of a trial or you're on your way back into a trial. So, we recognize though that that although the enemy, it seems, is getting greater and and the battles are getting stronger and the darkness of the world is closing in, but yet God has given us a provision. God has given us a way that we can pre be prepared for the battle that's laying out in front of us. I I love how the scripture begins there. He's saying, "Be strong in the Lord and in the power of his might." So, we can see the Bible is starting off by saying, "Look, it's not your might. It's not your ability. It's not what you can do, but be strong IN THE POWER OF THE LORD because it's his might. It's look, it's God that is going to see us through the battle. It's God that started the work. He's going to finish the work." &gt;&gt; And put on a whole armor of God that you'll be able to stand against the ws of the devil. For we wrestle not against flesh and blood. &gt;&gt; Amen. We wrestle not against flesh and blood. So look, this this evening, we recognize the devil is going to try to get you to look at your brother and look at your sister and say they're the problem and they're your there's what's causing the issues. But we see the Bible said, look, it's not flesh and blood. It's not your brother. It's not your sister. But it's look, it's principalities. It's powers, the rulers of the darkness. It's spiritual wickedness. So we recognize that we can identify everything. It's just a demon. It's just a spirit. Look, it it could be a spirit. spirit's got on somebody, but it's not the person. You You GOT TO BE CAREFUL. LOOK, IF SOMEONE IF someone if the devil's trying to point you to someone and the devil's trying to trying to get you to think negative, look, what you need to do is you just build build them up in prayer. LOOK, YOU MAY NOT BE ABLE TO EXPLAIN IT. YOU MAY not have to understand why they're doing what they're doing, BUT YOU SAY, "GOD, you're in control. I'm not going to LET THE DEVIL UH CHANGE MY THOUGHT of this person. I'm not going to let the I'm not going to sit here and spread rumors. I'm not going to sit here and spread negative. I'm just going TO GO TO MY PRAYER closet and I'm going to say, Lord, you know what they're going through. You know what they're doing with move in their life. &gt;&gt; Where take on the whole armor of God that you may be able to withstand in the evil day. &gt;&gt; And having done all to stand therefore &gt;&gt; so we recognize that look, the day is evil, but we're going to be able to stand. &gt;&gt; The day is dark, but we're going to be able to stand. Stand therefore having a loin skirt about with truth and having a breastplate of righteousness, &gt;&gt; feet shaw with the preparation of the gospel of peace, &gt;&gt; taking a shield of faith where we wherewith you'll be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked and take a helmet of salvation and a sword of the spirit which is the word of God. &gt;&gt; So he's laying out these preparations we can make. &gt;&gt; Let me pick up this quote right here. Brother Brandham said here some time ago in the army when our nation first provided a helmet. Oh my, that little rookie didn't want to wear that. It seemed unnecessary. But when he got in a battle, he needed it. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; God don't provide anything. &gt;&gt; Unless he has a need of it. Everything he provides for you, you better take it cuz you're going to have a need for it. &gt;&gt; Think about it. a little rookie with a 90 lb pack on his back in training. He's got a new suit on. You know, he don't see any necessary. And packing that 90 lb pack and all these picks and shovels and hand grenades and everything else, but let him get into battle one time and he'll recognize he'll see and he'll come to it. That's right. You see this little this little person maybe is in basic training here and and they begin to give him supplies. They begin to give him the equipment that he needs. And maybe this this little guy is sitting there thinking, "Hey, I can't carry this pack. It's too heavy for me. I DON'T NEED ALL THIS ANYWAY. What's the What's the need IN ALL THIS BODY armor and this big pack I'm carrying and all these provisions? And he's sitting there thinking, he's never been in battle. HE'S SAYING, "HEY, I DON'T I don't have a need for this. Why Why don't I just leave this here?" BUT YOU KNOW WHY THAT PACK IS MADE THAT WAY? CUZ there's been someone that went before him and has BEEN IN BATTLE. THERE'S BEEN SOMEONE THAT'S been stuck IN A TRENCH SOMEWHERE AND BULLETS FLYING OVER THEIR HEAD and they've been in the midst of the battle and they begin to recognize that we need this and we need that. And they prepared a an OUTFIT JUST RIGHT. THEY PREPARED A HELMET JUST RIGHT. THEY PUT A PREPARATION together and gave THEM A PACK AND SAID, "YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU'RE GOING TO NEED THIS PICK. You're going to need this shovel. You're going to need these extra bullets. You're going to need this body armor." Why? BECAUSE THEY'VE BEEN IN THE BATTLE BEFORE. And look, BROTHER BRANDHAM'S SAYING, "LOOK, GOD DON'T GIVE YOU nothing &gt;&gt; unless you're going to need it." &gt;&gt; So God right here has given us &gt;&gt; an armor to put on. &gt;&gt; You know what? If he gave us an armor, you know what that means? We're going to fight in a battle. &gt;&gt; If he gave you an armor, that means it's going to get hot sometimes. If he gave you armor, that means you're going to face the enemy sometimes. You're you're going to be in the midst of a battle sometime. It's not going to be perfectly easy. &gt;&gt; Brother said that's why the all- wise God equipped his army with the baptism of the Holy Ghost. He know these intellectual giants would stand in the last days. He know they'd stand and they'd try to explain by their great wisdom powers of Satan. &gt;&gt; They're like a roaring lion devouring what he will. So look, brother R said he's given the Holy Ghost &gt;&gt; as your preparation. Amen. &gt;&gt; Why? The Holy Ghost in you will be able to discern sir &gt;&gt; the spirits. It'll be able to discern the enemy. It'll be able to discern. Look, even when it was so close, it would deceive the very life if it were possible. &gt;&gt; If it were possible, BUT IT'S NOT POSSIBLE this evening. &gt;&gt; But he gave you an armor &gt;&gt; because there's a battle that lays before us. &gt;&gt; But he also gave us a sword. &gt;&gt; He gave us a sword. YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS? That we're not just going to be on the defense every day. We're not just going to be backed INTO A CORNER SOMEWHERE. YOU KNOW WHAT? I DON'T I I DON'T BELIEVE THAT GOD INTENDED US TO BE BACKED INTO A CORNER SOMEWHERE WITH OUR BACK UP AGAINST A WALL AND THE ENEMY JUST ATTACKING AND ATTACKING. BUT HE GAVE US A SWORD THAT WE COULD FIGHT. HE GAVE US A SWORD THAT WE COULD RUN AT THE ENEMY AND SAY NO. He gave us a sword. HE'S GIVEN US A WEAPON. WHY? BECAUSE HE WANTS US TO GO ON THE OFFENSE. You know what? YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU'RE JUST ON THE DEFENSE ALL THE TIME? YOU'RE SLOWLY losing ground. You may not realize it. You may not recognize IT, BUT YOU'RE SLOWLY BACKING UP. AND YOU KNOW WHAT the devil is doing? I'm afraid THAT A LOT OF TIMES THE DEVIL HAS BACKED US OFF OF THE PROMISE OF GOD. HE'S BACKED US AWAY FROM OUR VICTORY. He's backed us away from our healing. He's backed us away FROM OUR FREEDOM. I THINK IT'S TIME THAT WE TAKE THE SWORD THAT THE LORD HAS GIVEN US AND CUT BACK the enemy. LET'S TAKE BACK OUR FREEDOM. LET'S TAKE BACK OUR HEALING. LET'S TAKE BACK OUR JOY. LOOK, YOU'RE NOT MADE TO BE A DEFEATED PERSON. YOU'RE not made to be beat down and BACKED IN A CORNER. GOD SAID YOU ARE MORE THAN AN OVERCOMER. &gt;&gt; More than an overcomer. &gt;&gt; Step into it this evening. &gt;&gt; We're not to be on the defense the whole time. &gt;&gt; Take the word. &gt;&gt; Drive him out. pick up the sword of the spirit, &gt;&gt; which is the word, &gt;&gt; and begin to drive him out. &gt;&gt; We see Jesus &gt;&gt; when he was in the desert being tempted. We see that he he went into the desert to be trained. He went into the desert to to fast. And he's here in the desert. The Bible said he was led by the spirit. &gt;&gt; Led by the spirit. Why? There was some training that needs to take place. &gt;&gt; He was led by the spirit into a dry place. &gt;&gt; He was led by the spirit UNTIL A A DRY PLACE. AND THE BIBLE SAID he hungered. &gt;&gt; You know what? HE GOT TO A POINT WHERE HE was weak in his flesh. &gt;&gt; The Bible said after 40 days, he hungered. &gt;&gt; Watch this. Then the devil showed up. after he was there for 40 days, after he was hungry, after he was tired, after he was weak in his flesh, then the devil showed up. &gt;&gt; Hey, the devil is not afraid to attack you when you're at your weakest. The devil IS NOT AFRAID TO HIT YOU WHEN YOU'RE YOUR LOWEST. THE DEVIL IS NOT AFRAID TO KEEP HOW MANY'S EVER HAD A bad day where it seemed like nothing was going right? &gt;&gt; Where it seems like if one thing goes wrong, everything goes wrong. Hey, I've had days every seems like everything I touch breaks. Seems like everything I try to accomplish goes backward. I try to fix something, break something else. It just seems like it's JUST NOT MY DAY. WHY? IT JUST PILES ON. BUT THAT'S HOW THE DEVIL DOES. YOU'LL GET LOW SPIRITUALLY. You'll start to be in a desert place spiritually. And that's when the devil shows up. And that's when he starts to try TO FIGHT THE STRONGEST BATTLE. &gt;&gt; He's not afraid to show up &gt;&gt; when it's your weakest. &gt;&gt; You know, devil's had a lot of time learning the right buttons to push. The devil's had had a long time &gt;&gt; knowing exactly &gt;&gt; how to upset. You know, it's not the same for everybody. &gt;&gt; Some things might upset me more than they will upset you. &gt;&gt; Some things may upset you more than me. But the devil knows exactly how to go down. HE, YOU KNOW WHAT? He could be having the best day &gt;&gt; and all of a sudden, boom, &gt;&gt; the devil steps right. He said, "I'm not going to let this &gt;&gt; I'm going to let not going to let this happen. I'm not going to let this go. Hey, you you leave a good meeting. &gt;&gt; You ever walked out of a good meeting and you're in there and the word's coming forth and you just feel like you're on top of a mountain and you're sitting there, it seems like you're looking for a devil to fight CUZ YOU YOU JUST sit there say there ain't no devil that's going to stand in my way. You're you're coming out of his meeting and you walk out and you let that Monday morning at work. &gt;&gt; YOU WATCH THE DEVIL'S RIGHT THERE. HE SAID, "OH NO, WE'RE NOT GOING TO LET HIM STAY UP HERE. WE'RE NOT. HE'S RIGHT THERE TO FIGHT. But God has given us an armor &gt;&gt; to stand against it. &gt;&gt; Brother Random said, "We're taught in James 4:7 to resist the devil. &gt;&gt; He won't just walk away, but he'll flee." &gt;&gt; Resist the devil. How do you resist the devil? The same way our chief captain told us to do. Take the word of God. That's how you resist the devil. It's by the WORD OF GOD. THE CHIEF CAPTAIN TOLD US JUST HOW IT WAS DONE. SO, we see Jesus when he's in the desert. When he's there, he's being tempted and Satan comes at him and he's trying he's trying to tempt him. He's trying to to to do what he can to to GET HIM TO FALL THERE. But what DOES JESUS DO? HE STARTS TO RESPOND with the word. He begins to go in the word and say, "It is written." &gt;&gt; And the devil said, "Well, that one didn't work. Let me try this other one." Comes over here and says, "Well, how about this?" And Jesus says, "It is written." &gt;&gt; The devil said, "Well, that didn't work either. let me come over here and try this. AND JESUS RESPONDS, IT IS WRITTEN. YOU KNOW WHAT? JESUS could have just cast him away. He could have sent him away and said, "Quit bothering me." But you know what? He was so mindful of us in OUR DAILY WALK. HE KNEW THAT SOMEDAY in 2026, it was going to be dark and the enemy was going to BE FIGHTING AND SATAN WAS GOING TO BE RIGHT THERE. HE was going to come at you with this. But you know what you would have? You would have a word that had been given, a sword to cut against the devil. And you COULD SIT THERE JUST LIKE JESUS DID AND YOU COULD SAY, "IT IS WRITTEN." &gt;&gt; YOU COULD RESPOND THE SAME WAY JESUS DID AND SAY, "IT is written, no, Satan. It is written that I'm going to be victorious. It is written I'm going to be an overcomer. It is written that I DON'T HAVE TO WALK this defeated way." &gt;&gt; Said, "It's written." &gt;&gt; He responded with the word. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, like I said, &gt;&gt; Satan knows &gt;&gt; he's been around a long time &gt;&gt; learning &gt;&gt; how to attack. &gt;&gt; And as long as you try to fight the enemy on your own, you're going to lose every time. &gt;&gt; As long as you try to fight the enemy with your ability and what you know and what you can do, you're going to lose time and time and time again. But as soon as you take this word &gt;&gt; and you BEGIN TO PULL THAT SWORD OUT OF A SHEATH and you begin to say it is written, &gt;&gt; Satan don't know what to do then. &gt;&gt; He don't know what to do then. &gt;&gt; Brother Bam said so. &gt;&gt; The infinite God &gt;&gt; going to choose for his army &gt;&gt; the best weapon that could be given. He chose it. &gt;&gt; It was his word. God gave his army the best equipment that it could ever use. He could would never have to be changed. He has never changed it. You don't improve it. It remains the same all the time. It is God's word that he fortified his people with. You know what brother Ram's talking about there? If you you go back and READ THE CONTEXT, HE'S TALKING ABOUT HOW DIFFERENT NATIONS WOULD WOULD TRY TO CONSTANTLY improve their their army and their military and their weaponry. Why? Because each person each nation is trying to get an advantage over the other nation. Each each time as time has gone on, it's been a constant arms race with weaponry getting stronger and weaponry getting greater and and countries are constantly developing greater weapons. Why? BECAUSE THEY WANT AN ADVANTAGE. They want an edge. &gt;&gt; And so as soon as a weapon comes out, &gt;&gt; it's normally a very short time until it's obsolete. &gt;&gt; WHY? BECAUSE SOMEBODY GOT SOMETHING BETTER. SOMEBODY DEVELOPED something better. So then they have to go BACK AND THEY GOT TO START OVER AGAIN AND THEY GOT TO try to find something stronger. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT? GOD BEING INFINITE in the infinite wisdom knowing from the end from the beginning. He looked DOWN AND SAID, "LOOK, MY PEOPLE NEED A WEAPON. MY CHILDREN NEED A WEAPON. AND YOU KNOW WHAT? GOD CREATED the greatest weapon that he could ever give you. It'll never be outmatched. IT'LL BE NEVER BE OVERPOWERED." Look there, Satan is not going to develop a greater weapon. WHY? BECAUSE GOD IS INFINITE. He knew the greatest tactic that the enemy would ever get. He knew the LARGEST TACTIC THAT SATAN WOULD EVER DEVELOP. &gt;&gt; But he said, "It is written. &gt;&gt; It is written. &gt;&gt; Pick the word up and begin to cut away the enemy." &gt;&gt; LOOK, THERE THERE'S NO WEAPON POWERFUL ENOUGH. &gt;&gt; There's no weapon strong enough. &gt;&gt; Why? &gt;&gt; Said he gave his army the best equipment &gt;&gt; it could ever use. Romans 8:31. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; What shall we then say to these things? &gt;&gt; If God be for us, &gt;&gt; who can be against us? &gt;&gt; If God be for us this evening, who can be against us? Why do we get so concerned so many times when the battle's hot and it's dark around us? LOOK, GOD'S ON OUR SIDE THIS EVENING. GOD'S FIGHTING WITH us this evening. God is the one that's fighting the battle for us. Yes, &gt;&gt; but God has given us a supernatural armor &gt;&gt; for a supernatural battle. &gt;&gt; Brother here, he said, "Love, joy, peace, longsuffering, goodness, meekness, patience, faith, Holy Spirit, all these things are supernatural." What is love? What is joy? What is faith? Go down to the drugstore and buy a quarter's worth of it. &gt;&gt; You can't do it. Why? It's a spiritual battle, but it's a spiritual provision that has been given that no matter how dark it gets, NO MATTER HOW BAD IT IS, NO MATTER HOW TOUGH THE BATTLE IS, WHAT THERE'S A SPIRITUAL PROVISION given to you that that armor can go on and it'll stand against anything &gt;&gt; the devil throws at him. &gt;&gt; You see, it's it's been said throughout history, in a time of peace &gt;&gt; is when you prepare for war. In a time of peace is actually when you prepare for war. &gt;&gt; You might come to the point in your life where you're up on a mountaintop. &gt;&gt; Everything seems like it's going great. &gt;&gt; There's money in the bank. There's a great family. There's a great job. You got everything just seems like it's going right. &gt;&gt; You better start preparing. &gt;&gt; You better start laying up. &gt;&gt; You better start making sure everything's put together. You better make sure you're in the word. Why? Cuz Satan's not going to let that last. Satan is not going to let that last. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham here, I love this. He said, he's beginning a prayer and he says, "And may we buckle up &gt;&gt; the armor of GOD JUST A LITTLE TIGHTER TONIGHT. Go forward in battle tomorrow, knowing where right and wrong is engaged. &gt;&gt; May we not fear as we go, BUT MAY THE MORNING STAR SHINING over us, &gt;&gt; and if God be for us, who shall be against us?" &gt;&gt; He says, "May we buckle up &gt;&gt; the ARMOR OF GOD. MAY WE BUCKLE UP A LITTLE TIGHTER. You know what? We may find ourselves sometimes just getting a little lacadasical. Why? Because we're just going through the motions and and and life has got busy and and lay out of begins to creep its way in and you just begin to get a little lax. I say THIS EVENING, LORD, HELP ME BUCKLE UP THE ARMOR a little tighter this evening. May I go through my life and begin to examine myself? Let me make sure I've GOT THE HELMET ON. MAY I MAKE SURE MY BREASTPLATE IS ON. MAY I MAKE SURE I'VE GOT MY SHIELD IN FRONT OF ME. MAY I MAKE SURE MY SWORD IS SHARPENED UP. &gt;&gt; WHY? Buckle up a little tired. He said, "Buckle up &gt;&gt; that you may go face the battle tomorrow and not fear." Why? Because you know you've went through and examined your life. You went through and examine the armor. AND YOU KNOW IT'S ALL BUCKLED DOWN TIGHT AND YOU'RE PROTECTED FROM THE TOP OF YOUR HEAD TO THE BOTTOM OF YOUR FEET. WHY? BECAUSE YOU'VE BUCKLED IT TIGHTER. YOU'VE TAKEN THE ARMOR THAT GOD HAS PROVIDED. &gt;&gt; And put it on. &gt;&gt; Let's check ourselves. &gt;&gt; You got to constantly inspect &gt;&gt; your weapon and your armor. &gt;&gt; You know, if you're not diligent, &gt;&gt; the sword will get dull. &gt;&gt; It'll begin to get dull. &gt;&gt; You'll begin to get laxed. You know, if you take a weapon, &gt;&gt; if you take a firearm, &gt;&gt; and if you don't clean that thing &gt;&gt; and you keep shooting and shooting and shooting, it just gets dirtier and dirtier &gt;&gt; and one day it's just not going to go off. &gt;&gt; I like to shoot black powder muzzle loaders. &gt;&gt; You put a powder pellet or black powder in there &gt;&gt; and you got to clean that gun every few shots. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. There's a breach plug on the back and you got a cap. And when you strike the cap, a spark goes through the breach plug and ignites the powder. &gt;&gt; But if you're not careful, when you begin to shoot that gun over and over and over, it the the actual the it'll begin to foul up the brereech plug and one day you pull that trigger and the cap goes off and the powder DOES NOT IGNITE. WHY? BECAUSE THE BREREECH PLUG HAS BEEN SHUT OFF. IT'S BEEN FILLED UP WITH CORROSION. IT'S BEEN FILLED UP WITH THE POWDER, THE SPENT POWDER. I SAY THIS EVENING, we got to begin to take apart our weapons. This evening, WE GOT TO TAKE APART OUR LIVES. WE GOT TO TAKE LOOK ON THAT GUN. You actually take the breach plug out. You unscrew it and you clean it. I say we need to go down in the very depths of our heart this evening. And we need to examine and make sure everything is cleaned out. Make sure everything is cleaned up. BECAUSE LOOK, WHEN THE DEVIL'S IN FRONT OF YOU, I want to PULL THAT SWORD OUT. I WANT TO MAKE SURE IT'S SHARP. I WANT TO MAKE SURE IT CUTS. &gt;&gt; I don't want to pull THAT GUN UP AND PULL the trigger and nothing happen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We got to examine &gt;&gt; check ourselves. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; But we see &gt;&gt; we got to prepare for a battle. &gt;&gt; Why? Because a battle lays out in front of us. &gt;&gt; My grandpa was actually he was a drill sergeant during Vietnam. And I talked to him a lot. He actually he he taught people how to shoot and he he was in charge of men and he never he never went over but he sent a lot of men over overseas. And I talked to him a lot about it and to hear stories and he talks about how how he was he was very he was actually a Christian during the time who was never profane, never used language like that, but he was very difficult on the men. He said, "You know, I would rather be difficult on them now &gt;&gt; and forge a good soldier that I'll see go and come back &gt;&gt; rather than be nice to them now and be easy on them now &gt;&gt; and never see him again." &gt;&gt; I begin to think about that. THINK ABOUT GOING INTO INTO training and you got these men, they've never faced anything before. They've never faced adversity before &gt;&gt; and they could begin to sit there and WHEN THE DRILL SERGEANT comes and he begins to try to train them, he begins to TRY TO TRAIN THEM. MAYBE THEY WOULD SAY, "WHY HAS HE got to be so hard on us? &gt;&gt; Why does he GOT TO BE SO TOUGH ON US? &gt;&gt; Wouldn't it be nicer if he would just be easy? &gt;&gt; IF HE WOULD JUST JUST TAKE it easy on us. It doesn't have to be this hard. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT? THAT DRILL SERGEANT knows that in a few months, these men are going to be in a battle. &gt;&gt; THERE'S GOING TO BE BULLETS FLYING OVER THEIR HEAD. And he wants some men that aren't going to back up, that aren't going to get worried. THEY'RE NOT GOING TO CRUMBLE UNDER THE BATTLE. He wants TO MAKE SURE THEY'VE already faced something. YOU'VE GOT TO GO THROUGH SOMETHING TO PREPARE YOU FOR THE BATTLE THAT'S IN FRONT. If these men never faced anything in training, &gt;&gt; AS SOON AS THE FIRST BULLET FLEW OVER THEIR HEAD, THEY'D HIT the floor. They wouldn't know what to do. They wouldn't be able to operate. What? Fear would grip their life. &gt;&gt; But yet, &gt;&gt; he would train them. &gt;&gt; He would prepare them &gt;&gt; for a battle that lays in front of them. Amen. &gt;&gt; I don't want &gt;&gt; it to be so easy. &gt;&gt; They might think it, WOULDN'T IT JUST BE NICE? &gt;&gt; Wouldn't it just be easy? But he KNOWS THERE'S A BATTLE OUT IN FRONT OF THEM. &gt;&gt; They're training. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; For a rule. They're training for a war. &gt;&gt; Brother Josh one time was preaching &gt;&gt; preaching saying talking about God dealing with us as sons. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; You know what that means? Sometimes it means correction. &gt;&gt; Sometimes it means it's got to get the belt out. I don't know if y'all believe that anymore, BUT SOMETIMES IF YOU'RE RAISING CHILDREN, I BELIEVE YOU GOT TO GET THE BELT out a little bit. &gt;&gt; I got I got a little boy back there. &gt;&gt; And sometimes &gt;&gt; he acts up a little bit. And we've got to correct him. &gt;&gt; WHAT? IT'S OUT OF LOVE. WHY? BECAUSE I'M TRYING TO MOLD A CHARACTER. &gt;&gt; I want him to GROW UP TO BE A YOUNG MAN WITH CHARACTER. AND GOD'S THE SAME WAY. Sometimes &gt;&gt; God's got to come down and he's GOT TO CORRECT US A little bit. &gt;&gt; But you KNOW WHY? BECAUSE HE loves you. &gt;&gt; Because he says, "Hey, they're going to rule and they're going to reign with me." And that takes character. We know that characters is not given. &gt;&gt; It's not just a gift you walk into, but it's a victory. YOU GET CHARACTER BY OVERCOMING SOMETHING. &gt;&gt; EVERY BATTLE THAT YOU GO THROUGH, &gt;&gt; every time you face the enemy, &gt;&gt; here's just another character building opportunity. HERE'S ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY FOR ME TO GROW A LITTLE MORE CHARACTER. &gt;&gt; I say every time that we face something, MAYBE WE SAY, "LORD, MAYBE THERE WAS SOMETHING IN MY LIFE THAT JUST WASN'T QUITE LINING UP WITH WHAT YOU WANTED. Maybe there's something in MY LIFE THAT JUST DIDN'T LINE UP WITH THAT PERFECT PICTURE, the image you had for me. I SAY, LORD, IF THERE'S SOMETHING UNLIKE YOU, THEN CUT IT AWAY. &gt;&gt; It may not be comfortable. It may not feel good. It may hurt. It may be embarrassing, BUT I SAY, LORD, CUT IT AWAY this evening. I don't want anything standing between you and me. Let me go through this thing, &gt;&gt; with a good attitude. &gt;&gt; Let me face THIS TRIAL WITH A POSITIVE ATTITUDE, RECOGNIZING, LORD, MAYBE THIS, LET THIS DRAW ME CLOSER TO YOU. &gt;&gt; Let me use this as AN OPPORTUNITY TO STEP ONE STEP CLOSER TO YOU TO CUT AWAY SOMETHING THAT'S UNLIKE YOU. &gt;&gt; But we're training for a war. characters being mold molded in us. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; See some of these men &gt;&gt; in the military. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; You know, nations around the world &gt;&gt; fear some of our special forces. &gt;&gt; Why? Because they're battle tested. &gt;&gt; Why? Because they're proven. &gt;&gt; They have a track record of success. They're not just back there &gt;&gt; on a training ground somewhere, never seen anything. BUT WHY? SOME OF THESE MEN HAVE FACED THE BATTLE. They faced the enemy before and they've HAD SUCCESS UPON SUCCESS UPON SUCCESS. AND WHY? It creates a fear amongst the nations. THEY RESPECT IT. WHY? BECAUSE THERE'S A BATTLE TESTED. You know, there's some of these special forces units &gt;&gt; that you don't even get in without an invitation. &gt;&gt; You got to be selected. &gt;&gt; Somebody has to see you. They got to say YOU'VE BEEN IN THE BATTLE. YOU FACED THE ENEMY. &gt;&gt; And you've been exemplary. YOU'VE BEEN OUTSTANDING. AND THEY ACTUALLY INVITE YOU. THEY THEY THEY INVITE YOU TO THESE UNITS. some of the most elite of the elite &gt;&gt; BY INVITATION ONLY. I GOT TO THINKING ABOUT THAT. I said, "You know what? I believe I'm LOOKING AT SOME OF GOD'S SPECIAL FORCES." You were hand selected BY INVITATION. GOD LOOKED DOWN THROUGH TIME and he picked you out. HE PUT YOUR NAME on a book. He selected you by name. &gt;&gt; Why? cuz he recognized &gt;&gt; I'm going to put them through the training &gt;&gt; and they're not going to back up &gt;&gt; when the battle gets hot &gt;&gt; and the bullets start flying. They're not going to crumble. &gt;&gt; They're not going to back down. You know what they're going to do? They're going to stand up straight. They're going to face the enemy. They're going to pull their sword and say, "Satan, it may be hot. IT MAY BE DARK. THE DARTS MAY BE FLYING AROUND ME, but I GOT A SHIELD TO BOT THE DARTS. AND I GOT A SWORD TO GO ON THE OFFENSE. &gt;&gt; I believe I'm looking at some people &gt;&gt; who have a proven track record. &gt;&gt; A proven track record. &gt;&gt; You've taken God at his word time and time and time again. AND GOD SHOWED UP TIME AND TIME AND TIME AGAIN. &gt;&gt; So I don't know why the devil thinks &gt;&gt; that if he just brings another battle that you'll crumble. &gt;&gt; You hadn't crumbled yet. &gt;&gt; You hadn't given up yet. &gt;&gt; We've faced battles. &gt;&gt; We faced trials. WE FACED DARK TIMES. WE'RE STILL FIGHTING. WE MIGHT HAVE BEEN KNOCKED down a time or two, &gt;&gt; but we didn't stay there. &gt;&gt; You might HAVE GOT KNOCKED DOWN SOMETIME, &gt;&gt; but you KNOW WHAT YOU DID? YOU GOT BACK UP. YOU DUSTED YOURSELF OFF AND SAY, "LORD, I'M GOING TO KEEP FIGHTING THE BATTLE. &gt;&gt; I'm not staying on the ground." &gt;&gt; LOOK, I DON'T CARE HOW MANY TIMES YOU GET KNOCKED DOWN. &gt;&gt; I want to make sure you get back up, though. THE ONLY THING THAT MATTERS IS EVERY TIME THAT YOU GET BACK UP. &gt;&gt; I don't care what knocked you down. &gt;&gt; Look at David. &gt;&gt; You want to go through and &gt;&gt; begin to look at David's faults, &gt;&gt; the times he let God down, &gt;&gt; the times he failed. &gt;&gt; But you know what he did? &gt;&gt; Every time he got back up. &gt;&gt; And I love this. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You look at Abraham. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Look at his mistakes. &gt;&gt; You go through the Old Testament. See, he lied. &gt;&gt; He ran away. All the things. &gt;&gt; But you go over in the New Testament. &gt;&gt; You go in the New Testament. YOU LOOK THROUGH THE BLOOD. &gt;&gt; And you KNOW WHAT? THE ACCOUNT OF DAVID SAID HE WAS A MAN AFTER GOD'S OWN HEART. &gt;&gt; GO READ ABOUT ABRAHAM. IT SAID HE STAGGERED NOT AT THE PROMISE OF GOD THROUGH UNBELIEF. &gt;&gt; You want to look as a man in the Old Testament, you see mistakes, you see faults, you see failures, YOU SEE MEN THAT GOT KNOCKED DOWN. BUT YOU GO TO THE NEW TESTAMENT, look through the blood, YOU SEE MEN THAT STOOD BACK UP. &gt;&gt; AND THE ACCOUNT OF THEM is a man AFTER GOD'S OWN HEART. HEY, I'VE LET GOD DOWN MANY TIMES. I FAILED GOD MANY TIMES. BUT I'M STILL STANDING this evening by God's grace. HE PICKED ME UP TIME AND TIME AGAIN. AND I SAY, "LORD, MAY THE ACCOUNT OF MY LIFE &gt;&gt; be that I was a man after God's own heart, &gt;&gt; you'll get knocked down. &gt;&gt; But get back up." &gt;&gt; See, David was trained. &gt;&gt; David had experiences with God. that he could draw on &gt;&gt; before he faced the giant. &gt;&gt; HE DIDN'T WALK RIGHT UP AND FACE THE GIANT. &gt;&gt; HE DIDN'T JUST JUST WALK UP AND FACE THE GIANT ONE DAY. NO, HE spent years in the desert. &gt;&gt; He spent years in the desert being trained. &gt;&gt; He faced A BEAR. &gt;&gt; HE FACED A LION. &gt;&gt; ALL THE WHILE, HIS FAITH WAS BUILDING. ALL THE WHILE, &gt;&gt; HE began to HAVE A BACKLOG &gt;&gt; OF TESTIMONIES IN HIS BACK POCKET, &gt;&gt; he be TO SAY, "I WAS UP AGAINST THIS TRIAL AND GOD DELIVERED ME. &gt;&gt; I WAS UP AGAINST THIS TRIAL AND GOD MOVED ON THE SITUATION." What was HE DOING? HE WAS JUST PACKING HIS BAG WITH TESTIMONIES. &gt;&gt; How many's been doing that? &gt;&gt; How many's BEEN PACKING YOUR BAG WITH testimonies time after time? Say, you were against THIS TRIAL AND GOD BROUGHT you through it. &gt;&gt; You faced A BEAR AND GOD BROUGHT YOU THROUGH IT. &gt;&gt; YOU GOT A BAG FULL OF TESTIMONIES JUST WAITING FOR THE NEXT TRIAL. &gt;&gt; There he comes down. &gt;&gt; He comes there to the battle. &gt;&gt; He sees Goliath there. And &gt;&gt; there Saul and the children children of Israel claim to have God on their side. But they were backed up in a corner scared. &gt;&gt; They were backed up in a corner hiding behind their shields. &gt;&gt; Cuz they were scared. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; BUT WHEN DAVID COME UP ON THE SCENE, &gt;&gt; he began TO RECOGNIZE SOMETHING'S NOT RIGHT HERE. &gt;&gt; HE BE TO GO BACK THROUGH HIS THROUGH HIS LIFE AND BACK THROUGH THROUGH WHAT GOD SAID AND EXAMINE AND SAY, &gt;&gt; "God didn't intend &gt;&gt; for us to be scared. GOD DIDN'T INTEND FOR US TO be defeated and backed up here IN THE CORNER. GOD DIDN'T intend for this this devil, this Philistine, THIS GIANT TO HAVE HIS WAY with us. &gt;&gt; He went out to face the giant. &gt;&gt; He declined all THE ARMOR THAT SAUL TRIED TO GIVE HIM. WHY? HE HAD THE ARMOR OF GOD THAT WAS GREATER THAN ANY EARTHLY ARMOR that could be put on. Saul said, "Here, take this." And David said, "No, that's not going to work for me." &gt;&gt; But you know what? &gt;&gt; WHEN I WAS IN THE DESERT, &gt;&gt; WITH MY FATHER'S SHEEP, A BEAR COME DOWN OUT OF THE mountains &gt;&gt; and by God's grace slew him. &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW, A LION CAME DOWN &gt;&gt; AND GOD CAME THROUGH AND SLEW HIM. &gt;&gt; What difference is this Goliath? &gt;&gt; You know, &gt;&gt; how a devil will begin to get in your mind &gt;&gt; and he'll say, you know, &gt;&gt; I know God moved before. &gt;&gt; I know he healed you there. I know he delivered you then, but you know, this situation, &gt;&gt; it's just a little too big for God. &gt;&gt; He said, you know, I KNOW GOD HEALED YOU OVER AND OVER AGAIN. I KNOW GOD DELIVERED YOU WHEN YOU WERE IN need over AND OVER AGAIN, BUT THIS time it's just a LITTLE DIFFERENT. &gt;&gt; THIS TIME IT'S JUST TOO BIG. IF HE DID IT BEFORE, HE'LL DO IT AGAIN. IF HE MOVED BEFORE, HE'S THE SAME GOD. HE CHANGES NOT. &gt;&gt; David walked down in there. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Picked up those five stones &gt;&gt; representing sir &gt;&gt; f a i t h in jes su. &gt;&gt; I love brother Brandham. He said that David had the word, the promise, and the power to sling it. &gt;&gt; HE HAD A PROMISE AND HE HAD FAITH ENOUGH TO BELIEVE IN THAT PROMISE. WHY? CUZ GOD HAD MOVED BEFORE. HE had been prepared for this battle. He had been prepared for this moment. He knew. God knew that all the preparation, &gt;&gt; all the training was building HIM UP TO THIS MOMENT &gt;&gt; WHEN A GIANT WOULD BE STANDING IN THE WAY. AND DAVID WOULDN'T BACK UP AND BACK DOWN AND GET WORRIED. DAVID SAID, "THE SAME GOD THAT SLEW THE THE BEAR, THE SAME GOD THAT SLEW THE LION WILL SLAY GOLIATH." &gt;&gt; You know, we got to let we got to learn to let God fight our battles for us, though. You know, the problem is a lot of times we're trying to fight on our own. &gt;&gt; We're trying to take our muscles and OUR STRENGTH AND OUR KNOWLEDGE AND OUR ABILITY AND WE think we're GOING TO COMBAT GOLIATH WITH HOW STRONG WE ARE AND HOW SMART WE ARE. LOOK, THAT IS NOT GOING TO WORK. &gt;&gt; You got to back up AND SAY, GOD, YOU'RE THE ONLY WAY. &gt;&gt; MY STRENGTH IS NOTHING. BUT GOD, IT'S YOUR strength that defeated the bear. YOUR STRENGTH DEFEATED THE LION. YOUR STRENGTH DEFEATED GOLIATH. YOUR STRENGTH WILL DEFEAT THE DEVIL THAT'S IN FRONT OF ME. &gt;&gt; I love &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; There when Elisha and his servant were there and &gt;&gt; they woke up one morning &gt;&gt; and there was enemy all the way around them. &gt;&gt; There was enemy all the way around them. And the servant stepped out &gt;&gt; and he looked and he saw enemy. &gt;&gt; He turned around and he saw enemy. He turned around and saw enemy and he sat there and began to think there is no way we're getting out of this. &gt;&gt; How many's ever done that before? How many's ever ever woke up and you recognize that everything's falling apart around you? The enemy's attacking on every hand. And you begin to sit there and say, "There's no way. &gt;&gt; There's no way that I CAN OVERCOME THIS. THERE'S NO WAY I CAN COME through this. &gt;&gt; And on your own, &gt;&gt; you're right. &gt;&gt; On your own, there is no way. &gt;&gt; But Elisha stepped out and said, "Lord, open his eyes. &gt;&gt; Open his eyes." &gt;&gt; His eyes WERE OPEN AND HE RECOGNIZED ANGELS WERE COMPASSED ABOUT HIM. THERE WAS MORE ANGELS than there was enemy. &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW WHAT'S BEAUTIFUL ABOUT THAT IS THOSE angels were there the whole time. Those angels were there the whole time. He just couldn't see them. So when you're sit down and you recognize that there's enemy on every hand, there's things falling apart all around you. Let me encourage you this evening AND SAY THE ANGELS OF GOD ARE ENCAMPED ABOUT YOU. &gt;&gt; They're all the way around you. &gt;&gt; Elisha and his servant didn't have to fight at all. &gt;&gt; They didn't have to do anything. They come down and God blinded the enemy's eyes &gt;&gt; and Elisha just led him away. &gt;&gt; THEY DIDN'T HAVE TO FIGHT. GOD FOUGHT. &gt;&gt; WHY? &gt;&gt; TRAINING. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; They've been trained. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Moses, &gt;&gt; he had to go into the desert. He had to spend 40 years in the desert &gt;&gt; losing his earthly training &gt;&gt; so he could be trained by God. &gt;&gt; He had to lose all of his knowledge, &gt;&gt; all of his ability, &gt;&gt; all of his strength &gt;&gt; until one day he was just weak enough &gt;&gt; and he could be sensitive enough &gt;&gt; and he could be obedient to God. &gt;&gt; He had TO GET ALL HIS SCIENTIFIC KNOWLEDGE OUT. SO ONE day There could be a burning bush and HE COULD PASS BY AND HE COULD SEE THAT BURNING bush and he could go up there and be sensitive enough to recognize AND GOD COULD COME DOWN AND SPEAK TO HIM and use him. &gt;&gt; Why? Because he had to be trained. &gt;&gt; It's often in the dry places in our life &gt;&gt; where the most gross takes place. It's often when it's dry and thirsty and dark &gt;&gt; is when God is molding your character the most. &gt;&gt; That's when the most growth is taking place. &gt;&gt; Takes a backs of the desert experience. &gt;&gt; You look at brother Brandham, &gt;&gt; the things that he went through &gt;&gt; to form his character. &gt;&gt; Think about the things that he had to go through. That's right. the lessons he had to learn &gt;&gt; starting off early in his life &gt;&gt; there. He he had a call to go to the Pentecostals and he refused it, &gt;&gt; he had to pay for that decision. &gt;&gt; What it was a lesson that he learned though &gt;&gt; there he's in South Africa &gt;&gt; and the Lord says go to this certain meeting &gt;&gt; but he let the BROTHERS TALK HIM OUT OF IT and he paid for that. BUT ALL THE WHILE, GOD WAS MOLDING A CHARACTER in there. &gt;&gt; And one day, there was a little woman &gt;&gt; THAT HAD A SON THAT WAS SICK AND DYING IN BED. &gt;&gt; AND SHE BEGAN TO FERVENTLY PRAY for this child. She began to look in the Bible and recognize herself. She looked out and said, "God, I'M YOUR SHUNOMI WOMAN. WHERE'S YOUR ELIJAH? &gt;&gt; THAT'S ME. &gt;&gt; WHERE'S THE OTHER PART OF THIS SCRIPTURE?" And brother Brandham's flying across the COUNTRY AND A PLANE lands in Memphis. &gt;&gt; And the next morning, BROTHER BRANDHAM'S GOING TO DROP SOME LETTERS OFF AND GOING TO GO TO HIS go to the airport. &gt;&gt; And a little voice &gt;&gt; begins to come down and say, "Turn this way. &gt;&gt; Turn this way." &gt;&gt; You know what there was? There was a man that had been trained. &gt;&gt; There was a man that had went through stuff. There was a man that had faced the enemy before. HE HAD MADE MISTAKES BEFORE. HE HAD GOT BACK UP AND SAID, "LORD, help me." He had learned and his character had been molded till he could be so sensitive &gt;&gt; to God's leading &gt;&gt; that he would turn here &gt;&gt; AND TURN THERE. ALL THE WHILE KNOWING THAT PLANE WAS GOING TO LEAVE WITHOUT HIM. &gt;&gt; ALL THE WHILE KNOWING HE WAS GOING TO MISS that flight. &gt;&gt; But there was a little woman THERE &gt;&gt; THAT WAS CRYING OUT TO GOD. AND GOD SAID, "Here's your Elijah. &gt;&gt; There was A MAN THAT WAS SENSITIVE enough &gt;&gt; that he could be used by God. &gt;&gt; I say, Lord, help me &gt;&gt; go through training in my life. Let me BE TRAINED TILL I can be sensitive ENOUGH THAT IF THERE'S SOMEONE THAT HAS NEED, IF THERE'S SOMEONE THAT'S STRUGGLING that maybe the Lord could use me, &gt;&gt; MAY I BE SENSITIVE ENOUGH THAT IF THE LORD DIRECTS ME, go here or go there. &gt;&gt; Let me be able to be used. &gt;&gt; But we see it was the training that took place. We're molded by our trials. &gt;&gt; Our battles and trials, they mold the character in us. &gt;&gt; First Peter 1:7, that the trial of your faith &gt;&gt; being much more precious &gt;&gt; than of gold, &gt;&gt; much more precious than of gold, watch this, that perisheth. &gt;&gt; Why is it more precious than gold? &gt;&gt; Because character is eternal. Gold's going to perish. &gt;&gt; All the riches in the world &gt;&gt; are going to perish. &gt;&gt; They're all going to go away. &gt;&gt; The greatest witches riches in the world aren't going to make you happy. They aren't going to make you fulfilled &gt;&gt; being much more precious than gold &gt;&gt; that perishes. though it be tried with fire might be found unto praise and honor and glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; So the trial OF YOUR FAITH, THE THINGS YOU GO THROUGH ARE PRECIOUS TO YOU. WHY? BECAUSE THEY'RE MOLDING THAT CHARACTER THAT IS REQUIRED FOR YOU TO REIGN with Christ. &gt;&gt; I love uh just the other day I was relistening to the testimony of brother Gary Walker. I don't know if y'all how many of y'all have heard that, but he he actually came uh years ago to brother Tim Humes when I was still going there and gave his testimony. JUST A A POWERFUL TESTIMONY. You can find it on YouTube. &gt;&gt; Here he was in this car crash and he the list of injuries is just just unfathomable. &gt;&gt; And he's laying in the hospital and he begins TO TALK ABOUT HOW much in pain he was and the pain was just unbearable. &gt;&gt; And he ACTUALLY GOT TO THE POINT he began to ask God why. Here he was a pastor. He was on the field preaching. I believe at the act time of the accident, he was actually on his way back from preaching. He had a family with children. And he's asking God, "Why &gt;&gt; my children DON'T HAVE A FATHER RIGHT NOW? MY CHURCH IS doesn't have a pastor. His businesses were going by the wayside." And he said, God spoke to him &gt;&gt; and said, "If you could see the bigger picture, &gt;&gt; you would volunteer for it. If you could SEE THE BIGGER PICTURE, YOU WOULD VOLUNTEER FOR IT. HOW POWERFUL IS THAT? WHY? BECAUSE ALL WE CAN SEE IS SUCH A SMALL LITTLE PORTION OF TIME. &gt;&gt; BROTHER BRANDHAM SAID IN ONE SPOT, HE SAID, "HOW COULD YOUR LITTLE human your finite mind &gt;&gt; understand the infinite mind OF GOD? IT'S NOT POSSIBLE. &gt;&gt; Our little minds, we just can't UNDERSTAND IT. BUT GOD KNOWS THE END FROM THE BEGINNING. Every trial he puts in your way, every every fight, every battle, EVERY MOUNTAIN YOU GOT TO climb up, it's for a reason. &gt;&gt; Think of all the people &gt;&gt; my brother &gt;&gt; that brother Walker came in contact with through that &gt;&gt; condition, through that time. MAYBE THERE WAS ONE PERSON &gt;&gt; THAT THAT WAS THEIR ONLY OPPORTUNITY &gt;&gt; TO COME IN CONTACT WITH JESUS CHRIST. MAYBE THAT WAS THEIR ONLY OPPORTUNITY. &gt;&gt; Imagine getting to the other side &gt;&gt; and you meet somebody &gt;&gt; that says, "You remember that time you were in the hospital? &gt;&gt; You remember that time you WERE GOING THROUGH THE DARKEST TRIAL OF YOUR LIFE? &gt;&gt; But you had a positive attitude through it all. &gt;&gt; REMEMBER THAT TIME THAT I THAT MEANT SOMETHING TO ME. I SAW THAT THAT HAD AN EFFECT ON MY LIFE. HOW WORTH IT WOULD IT BE then &gt;&gt; if you could recognize that your trial, &gt;&gt; YOUR BATTLE &gt;&gt; HAD AN EFFECT ON SOMEBODY? &gt;&gt; But we got to go THROUGH EVERYTHING WITH A POSITIVE ATTITUDE. &gt;&gt; If you're not careful, when the battle gets hot, you start to say, "God, why? &gt;&gt; Why me? WHY THIS? WHY AM I FACING THIS? WHY AM I GOING THROUGH THIS?" AND YOU BEGIN TO get negative. &gt;&gt; Nobody wants what you have &gt;&gt; if you get negative. &gt;&gt; You know, the Bible said it's a peace that passes all understanding. &gt;&gt; A PEACE THAT PASSES ALL UNDERSTANDING. WHY? BECAUSE YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE peace in the midst of conflict. &gt;&gt; Peace in the midst of the storm, peace when everything's falling apart around you, PEACE WHEN EVERYTHING'S GOING WRONG. And that's a peace. It passes all understanding because the world looks at you and the world looks at you and they say, "This is going wrong and that's going wrong and this is happening and that's happening and you're still at peace." &gt;&gt; I don't understand that &gt;&gt; the world looks and says, "You're still at peace. &gt;&gt; YOUR YOUR YOUR WORLD'S falling apart around you and you've not lost your faith. &gt;&gt; You're still at peace. You're still saying the Lord that giveth, the Lord that takes away. &gt;&gt; You're still saying God's Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today, and forever. You're saying he'll never leave me. He'll never forsake me. &gt;&gt; He'll be with me, even in me. &gt;&gt; It's a peace the WORLD CAN'T UNDERSTAND. WHY? CUZ IT'S A PEACE THAT ONLY THIS WORD can give. &gt;&gt; IT'S A PEACE THAT'LL PREPARE YOU FOR THE MIDST OF BATTLE. It'll prepare you for the midst of the storm. We can't complain &gt;&gt; sending us through testing and through trying. &gt;&gt; Brother Bham uses the illustration of those fire departments. &gt;&gt; A fire breaks out in a building in in Jeffersonville and the fire department pulls up and &gt;&gt; he said the fire chief is just standing in the background saying, "Well, put a little WATER THERE AND PUT A LITTLE WATER THERE AND PUT A LITTLE water there." And he said, "The fire is just raging the whole time. But he said all of a sudden here comes Louisville across THE BRIDGE AND THEY FLY UP TO the scene and they begin. He said THE CHIEF JUMPS RIGHT OUT. HE'S THE FIRST ONE UP THE LADDER. He said he had an axe in one hand and a water hose in the other hand. He's not sitting there SAYING SPURT A LITTLE WATER HERE, spurt a little water there. NO, HE SAID, "COME ON, BOYS. FOLLOW ME." And he breaks right through and begins to PUT THE FIRE OUT. WHY? BECAUSE there was experience there. That wasn't his first fire. THAT WAS NOT HIS FIRST BATTLE. HE'D BEEN IN A battle before and he could lead by example and say, "Come on, boys." &gt;&gt; Brother Bannam said that's the same &gt;&gt; as Jesus Christ did. He led by example. He come and lived as a human and conquered death, hell, and the grave and said, "Come on, boys. &gt;&gt; COME ON. FOLLOW ME. &gt;&gt; He led by example. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Giving us a word &gt;&gt; that we could overcome with. &gt;&gt; The message came to prepare us for battle. &gt;&gt; That bring us to a close here. &gt;&gt; The message came to reveal the enemy and his tactics. &gt;&gt; What? To bring us back into a relationship with Jesus Christ. Make him real once again. You know, people, they want to believe that the devil is some creature with horns and hooves and &gt;&gt; they want to believe that. &gt;&gt; They don't recognize that the devil &gt;&gt; is cunning. &gt;&gt; The devil's beautiful. &gt;&gt; The devil has all the shiny things that draw the attention. &gt;&gt; The devil has all the shiny things &gt;&gt; to come in and try to deceive. &gt;&gt; That's right. Yes. &gt;&gt; Why? It's so close. &gt;&gt; He's shrewd and wise. &gt;&gt; That's why it was important that the message would come &gt;&gt; and display his tactics. &gt;&gt; THE MESSAGE WOULD COME DOWN AND SAY, "LOOK, WE'RE going to PULL THE VEIL OFF THE DEVIL. &gt;&gt; THE DEVIL'S SHREWD. HE'S WISE. HE'S GOING TO COME IN AND TRY TO DECE DECEIVE, &gt;&gt; but it'll expose his tactics &gt;&gt; and identify him." See, his tactics are reasoning. &gt;&gt; That's one of the main tactics that the enemy uses, reasoning. &gt;&gt; BROTHER BRANDON SAID, "FAITH doesn't reason." &gt;&gt; Faith doesn't reason. &gt;&gt; But the enemy wants you to reason. &gt;&gt; THE ENEMY WANTS YOU TO COME DOWN. AND THE ENEMY WANTS TO COME in and say, "Look, I know he moved before. I know he said you could be victorious. &gt;&gt; I know he said you could overcome. But you know the doctor said &gt;&gt; the doctor said &gt;&gt; you know science shows &gt;&gt; I love how brother Bam talks about Noah there and there he is and he's going to build a boat and he said God said it's going to rain and the scientists would come and say look we shot the moon we shot the stars we can tell you there's no water up there there's no way it's going to happen THE SCIENCE REPORT SAID IT'S NO THERE'S NO WAY. &gt;&gt; What if he'd have started reasoning with that &gt;&gt; and said, "Well, God, I know you said this, but but look, the scientists and Dr. SO AND SO AND THIS GUY'S SAYING THIS and no, &gt;&gt; faith doesn't reason. &gt;&gt; If God said it, you stand on it and you believe it. &gt;&gt; Faith doesn't reason. &gt;&gt; Bill, come back to the music this evening. It takes a hand of faith &gt;&gt; to hold the sword. &gt;&gt; It takes a hand of faith &gt;&gt; to hold the sword. &gt;&gt; If you don't have any faith, a sword's not going to do you any good. &gt;&gt; Because as soon as YOU PULL THAT SWORD OUT, there the enemy is going to be to reason you out of it. &gt;&gt; To reason you away from every promise, reason you away from every victory. But if you got a hand of faith holding that sword, &gt;&gt; there's no reasoning. &gt;&gt; There's no talking you out of it. There's no talking YOU AWAY FROM IT. WHY? BECAUSE YOU GOT THE FAITH HOLDING THAT SWORD. &gt;&gt; Brother Bham said, &gt;&gt; sir, &gt;&gt; grab the faith. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; That sword of the spirit. &gt;&gt; Thus sayeth the lord. &gt;&gt; Scream hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Then cut down every enemy in front of you. &gt;&gt; There it is. Cut every enemy. &gt;&gt; If an old SPOOKY SPIRIT STARTS MAKING YOU FEEL ALWAYS, CUT THE THING AWAY WITH THE WORD OF GOD. I SAY THIS EVENING, IF THERE'S A SPOOKY SPIRIT THAT'S GOT YOU FEELING SOME FUNNY WAY, IF A IF THE DEVIL HAS PUT A SPOOKY SPIRIT IN YOUR HOUSE OR IN YOUR LIFE, IN YOUR FAMILY, TAKE THE WORD AND CUT IT AWAY. Brother Bandham said, "But our strength is the joy of the Lord is my strength." &gt;&gt; The joy OF THE LORD IS MY STRENGTH THIS EVENING. NOT MY ABILITY, NOT MY WAY, BUT THE JOY OF THE LORD. &gt;&gt; He said, "Get away from me." &gt;&gt; WHACK. YOU CUT HIM WITH THE WORD. WHETHER it be a demon, whether it be enemy, whether it be sickness, whether it be disease, whatever it is, take that word, pull it with the sword. &gt;&gt; Watch this. I love this. &gt;&gt; He said, "If you whack it the first time, &gt;&gt; and it don't seem to move, whack it again. &gt;&gt; Whack it again AND WHACK IT AGAIN. WHACK IT UNTIL YOU'VE CHIPPED A HOLE through it." &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU MAY PULL THE SWORD OUT ONE TIME AND YOU MAY START FIGHTING. MAYBE YOU HIT THE DEVIL THE FIRST HIT AND HE DON'T BACK UP. &gt;&gt; You know what you do? &gt;&gt; You keep swinging. &gt;&gt; IF HE DON'T BACK UP THE SECOND TIME, YOU SWING AGAIN. &gt;&gt; BROTHER BRANDHAM SAID, "IF YOUR ENEMY DOESN'T BACK UP THE FIRST TIME YOU WHACK AT IT, YOU WHACK HIM AGAIN AND WHACK HIM AGAIN. WHACK HIM AGAIN until he backs up." Brother Brandham said, &gt;&gt; "Whack it until you chipped a hole through it &gt;&gt; like a little chicken p peeking itself out." Or an eagle peek yourself RIGHT THROUGH THAT OLD SHELL OF SICKNESS. CUT YOUR WAY OUT AND SAY, "HALLELUJAH. WHERE'S THE NEXT ONE? That's the battle. THAT'S A SOLDIER. THAT'S A SOLDIER of the cross. Yes, sir. Knock every enemy out. He's saying you got TO JUST START PECKING YOUR WAY THROUGH THAT OLD SHELL OF SICKNESS, THAT OLD SHELL OF DEFEAT, THAT OLD SHELL OF DEPRESSION, THAT COME ON NOW. &gt;&gt; You got to keep pecking YOUR WAY THROUGH IT. WHY? GOD GAVE YOU A SWORD. HE GAVE YOU He gave you his word &gt;&gt; and it's STRONG ENOUGH FOR EVERY DEMON, FOR EVERY SICKNESS, EVERY WORRY, EVERY PROBLEM. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; As you stand to your feet this evening, &gt;&gt; Brother Bam said, "And when a man or a woman &gt;&gt; is dressed &gt;&gt; in the full armor of God, &gt;&gt; it is it ain't power, &gt;&gt; it's authority from on high." &gt;&gt; When he says, "The devils will scream and the breaks will squeak. EVEN DEATH ITSELF will shutter and graves will open at the authority that Jesus Christ gave his church. &gt;&gt; These shines shall follow them that believe. Lift up the authority the inside. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Brother man said when you put on the full armor of God, &gt;&gt; it's not your power. &gt;&gt; It's not your ability. &gt;&gt; It's not what you can do, but it's the authority that God gave you that's stronger than every enemy. Amen. &gt;&gt; What did he say? He gave you the greatest weapon. &gt;&gt; There's nothing. LOOK, THE DEVIL'S NOT GOING TO COME UP with something too great tomorrow. He's not going to develop a weapon that's stronger. He's not going to develop a weapon that's greater than what you have. You've got the weapon of faith in this word. And you can take that hand of faith and you can hold the sword up and you CAN FIGHT EVERY DEVIL. LOOK, DON'T LET HIM BACK YOU IN THE CORNER. DON'T LET HIM DEFEAT YOU. DON'T LET HIM PUSH YOU BACK. YOU'VE GOT A SWORD FOR A REASON TO fight &gt;&gt; and go on the offense this evening. &gt;&gt; Let's bow our heads and pray. Dear heavenly father, Lord, we thank you Lord for your grace and your mercy. Lord, we thank you Lord for Lord for giving us an armor Lord for giving us a preparation. Lord, you didn't just put us here and lay out a sea of that and let us try to figure it out on our own. But Lord, you sent a message to prepare us. YOU SENT A MESSAGE TO DRESS UP BRIDE. You sent A MESSAGE THAT WOULD THAT WOULD GIVE US THE PREPARATION we would need to face the battle every day. Lord, we know the battle is hot. We know that the enem is fighting stronger and stronger every day, Lord. But you've already given us the greatest weapon, Lord. Help us, Lord, to examine ourselves, Lord. May we go and begin to look through our lives and say, Lord, do we need to buckle something up a little tighter? Do we need to bring this armor and tighten it down because we know there's a battle out in front of us? Lord, may we sharpen up our swords as we dig into this word and dig into this message. And Lord, begin to stack away these testimonies, stack away these quotes, stack away these nuggets out of the scripture that when the enemy begins to come against us, WHEN THE ENEMY TRIES TO FIGHT, WE CAN BEGIN TO PULL them out and say, "It is written. It is written." Lord, help us, Father, in our daily walk. Lord, be with us and go with us, Lord, that we would be prepared for the battle that lays before. We give you the glory and the honor. In Jesus name we pray. Amen. And amen. God bless you this evening. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Amen. You believe the Lord speak to you spoke to you tonight. So let's give the Lord a big thanksgiving clap tonight. Amen. What a timely message. Prepare for the battle. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And that battle is not yours. &gt;&gt; It is the battle of the Lord. &gt;&gt; And that battle is a blessing in disguisement. Amen. &gt;&gt; It looks like a battle, but it's an opportunity for God. &gt;&gt; God has been giving you so much ammunition &gt;&gt; and you wonder why this unfolding of the word. Why the mysteries? Why does he have to preach Revelation one, Revelation 2? Why does he have to preach Hebrew one? Why do we have to have 1,200 and so forth messages? God knew we need all of them. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The bag might feel like it's heavy, but the one who went before &gt;&gt; knew what we needed to pack &gt;&gt; to make it all the way to the other side. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Carry the message. Put the message in the bag. Keep loading the message. Keep listening to the message. Keep packing because you would need it. And at the appropriate time when the enemy comes, it will be an opportunity for God to use the training that you went through and to use it for another victory. So your battle is actually an opportunity for another experience, another victory, another deliverance because God is in the midst of the battle. &gt;&gt; Whatever is in your life that need to be clean up, clean up. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Clean it up completely. God don't want you to back up. God doesn't want you to be on defense. When you're going on defense, you are losing ground. &gt;&gt; As as you backing up, the enemy is moving forward. You need to be moving forward. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So the enemy can back up. &gt;&gt; Remember the noble man before he goes, he took one thing and he left the pound. And the pound was money. &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham say money represent what? &gt;&gt; This is what God is talking to you and insisting for 2025. You need that faith to be able to move forward. You need that faith to be able to hold the sword &gt;&gt; and to cut through everything and move forward. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Take the pond that you have given and put it to work. back again. Put it to work. &gt;&gt; Put it to work. Take the faith that he gave you. Brother Brandham say faith must be put to work. &gt;&gt; The noble man say take the pond and occupy until I come. So we have a commission to use our faith until the Lord come. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And you cannot use your faith without trial. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's why trials are coming. And when they are coming, it's an opportunity for you to display your faith and to see where you are, to evaluate yourself, and to go forward again for the next one. Let's pray. Heavenly Father, Lord, we are approaching you humbly tonight. Father, thanking you for your grace, for your love, for your mercy, Father, for speaking to us in such a powerful way for this year again. Lord, I don't know who just came out of a battle. I don't know who is preparing to go into the battle. I don't know everybody who is in the midst of the battle. But I know that your word doesn't come void. He came for a purpose. And you know that tonight the message that we need to listen is this one, Lord. Father, I pray that the Holy Spirit, Lord, Father, take this word, this message that has been preached tonight and bring it way deep in the heart of your children.
