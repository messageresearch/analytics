always deem it a a wonderful privilege to come to this church this is our second home and uh always enjoy when we can come back here because of the way word praise be to God the prophet says the the the beauty of the church is the character of the people and uh we we we we enjoy the quality of the word that comes from this church and and the quality of the Believers that come from this church praise be to God if we can stand for the reading of the word uh do we have a mouse clicker or okay don't worry Brothers if you can't find it we can do the old school way when our Lord was preaching there was no microphone there was no pH system he would stand upon a heel and said blessed are the poor first suel chter 20 verse 36 yes brother Bible says if if you have it you can say Amen 1 Samuel chapter 20 verse 36 amen if you have your Bibles I know we are in the South and uh a lot of people have guns but do you have your bibles if you have it you can you can turn with me oh [Laughter] yes and he said unto his lad run find out now the arrows which I shoot and as the lad ran he shot an arrow Beyond him and when the lad was come to the place of the arrow which Jonathan had shot Jonathan cried after the lad and he said is not the arrow Beyond thee amen hallelujah yes sir is is not the arrow Beyond thee we can have your seats in the presence of the Lord uh some for some of you Bible readers you are familiar with this story of David David loved Jonathan and Jonathan loved David amen and David loved Jonathan until he would even give up the kingdom for David and Jonathan is a type of a real believer who loves Jesus Christ amen Beyond his own life that's exactly he loves Jesus Christ Beyond his own ambition he loves the Lord Jesus Christ beyond what this Earth can give to him and his father could not change his heart that's exactly right when Jonathan died David lamented for Jonathan yes sir and he says my brother Your Love exceeded the love of women that's exactly right Hallelujah sir amen because the Bible says that Jonathan's heart and and and David they were so neat together that's exactly right and that it's a type of of Christ amen it's a type of Christ and the believer because remember Jesus Christ is a friend that sticks closer than a brother amen amen and and and the Bible Jesus Christ said to the disciples I shall call you not I shall now call you friends because he was revealing his secrets to them amen and he said unto Abraham Abraham is my friend that's right and I have to tell him what I'm about to do to Sodom yes sir because you tell your your secrets to your friends amen hallelujah amen and your wife is your friend too that's why you tell her everything yes my brother you tell her everything yes my brother praise be to God yes my brother and the sister say Amen thank you if the brothers don't say Amen the sisters will say Amen this is one thing I like about this church is because the sisters will say amen and it's a it's preaching to the wise virgins they don't sleep in church amen praise be to God I believe tonight I'm not preaching to the sleeping virgins no sir I am preaching to the wise virgins because they have oil in their lamps yes my brother yes sir Hallelujah yes sir glory to God so David yes sir was anointed king amen and he was anointed at a very very young age that's right and I want you to know that God does not look at you based on your age no sir God works with you based on your heart they asked brother Bram how how soon can we baptize a child says as soon as they repent as soon as they repent we don't have if they repent at 13 years years old and they know what they are doing we baptize them if they repent at 15 years old we baptize them yes my brother Hallelujah preach my brother because God works with people based upon their hearts yes my brother some people think well God will start to work with me when I get old no sir things don't work like that no sir God wants to work with you right now amen God wants to have your energy right now he wants to have your strength right now he wants to have your time right now yes my brother Hallelujah yes sir and the enemy does not wait also for you to get old that's exactly right the enemy does not care about your age no sir he's not going to say you know what I'm going to attack the older ones this one is so young let me just leave him for a little bit the devil does not do that no sir Billy Paul smoked his first cigarette he was about 13 14 years old the devil does not care that's why you must bring your children to church because we have to catch them young yes my brother yes sir yes my brother the people that change the world are not necessarily very very old people uh-uh they're very very young amen Marilyn mroe was very young Elvis Presley was very very young Michael Jackson was very young right now I was reading there's this lady called Taylor Swift some of you might not know her because I know that I'm I'm preaching to very very spiritual people when she comes to town There's an earthquake and she's about 32 33 years old I said if the world can take a person and use it to such an extent how much more can God do with a young man and a young woman who fully surrendered unto [Applause] sh Hallelujah so God wants to use the young people God wants to use the old people God will work with what soever is given unto [Music] him because remember salvation yes sir and adoption are two different things Hallelujah because remember we shall receive a crown and we shall receive we shall go to judgment to receive our reward based on what we did how many knows that the prophet talks about the recording Angel and he says I had a dream I was walking the ivory steps and there was a recording angel that was calling people's names to receive a reward Hallelujah so a reward is based on what you do for the Lord praise be to God when you come for service the recording Angel is putting that in the book when you are singing a special song the recording Angel is putting that in the book and you receive a blessing according to your [Music] [Applause] conduct the pastor might not see you but the recording angels sees you your neighbor may not sees you but the recording angel will sees you that's why the Bible says you servants obey your masters and work as if you are working unto the Lord because even if the master does not see what you're doing the recording angel will pick it up and obey your husband is unto the Lord say oh brother Aaron he doesn't he doesn't he doesn't even appreciate the recording angel will see it so now David was anointed at a very young very very young age and when you are anointed that's when trouble starts some people feel like well when I come to the message everything is going to be all right that's a lie when you come to Christ that's the when the battle starts when you make a decision that's when the fight begins and you will see that the most spiritual time of David's life sir when when he was running away from sa when he was in the palace he was a very very kindal man there were no there were not great many exploits that David did when he was in the palace a lot of the Psalms were written when he was running away from Saul and many testimonies they come when you are going through situations glory be to God some of the most special moments in your marriage are not when everything is all right it's the days when you have to share a sandwich hallelujah it's the days when you have to share the same car those are the most spiritual days of your marriage when you are living in a one-bedroom apartment and you are sharing everything Hallelujah that's when the anointing comes and you say the Lord is my shepherd I shall not [Applause] want you say brother Aon I'm going through a lot of things these are your most spiritual days amen amen amen amen preach because you know what yes you said brother Aon I've cried many days uhhuh that's part of the program yes my brother I I went to see my optisan one time uh-huh take your and he says he says Uh there's nothing wrong with your eyes uhhuh they are just too dry uhhuh you not crying enough so I'm going to give you artificial tears I'm going to write for you artificial tears and you buy these eye drops once in a while put it in your eyes because you see your body the eyes they need for the natural it's a natural uh disposition for you to cry and then the Holy Ghost begin to work on me and I said you know what crying is not actually bad it's it's scriptural as long as you not crying unto men but if you are crying unto the Lord you are in the [Applause] scriptures because David how many times do we did the Bible and David says this poor man cried this poor man cried and I cried unto the Lord I said you know what I'm going to cry out unto the Lord this Poorman cried and the Lord hurt him praise be to God but our problem is we cry to our neighbors we cry to the government we cry to the people you must cry out unto the [Applause] Lord hallelujah so David sir was anointed but as soon as he he was anointed God God chased him away and David was hoping that you know what maybe Saul would come back to his senses but you know what this was the work of the Lord and sa was not going to come to his senses hallelujah amen so when David was anointed and Saul wanted to kill David it was not because of David but it was because of the anointing that was upon David and the reason why why people hate the Jews it's not because of how they look it's not because of what they do it's because of God's election and the reason why the bride will be hated is because of the anointing that is why if you love Christ there's no way the world will love you the world will not love you because Christ said if they hated me they shall hate me if they can do this to the to the Master how much more shall they do un the servants praise be to God so David was hoping that maybe per Adventure something was going to happen and then maybe Saul would come back to his senses and he said okay Jonathan you go to the dinner with my father when you go to the dinner see his reaction just see if if if if he's willing for me to come back right let's let's just find out if if if they will allow me to come back right there are situations where sometimes you feel like well will I ever be accepted in that church again will I will will my parents ever accept me again I've been away from home I've back siden it's questions that come in a person's mind oh if I go back to my husband will he accept my apology if I go back to my family so so so David take spoke with Jonathan and and Jonathan says this shall be the sign I will see if my daddy wants you to come back I will shoot the arrow and if I say the arrow is near then you you free to come back that's exactly but if I say the arrow is far from thee then you have to run away that's exactly right how many knows the story then you have to run away so naturally David being a man that was anointed by God he must have thought you know what I think God is going to fight for me God is going to change the heart of Saul God is going to change the situation you know what I am bright everything is going to change I'm going to speak the word and the Miracle will happen but sometimes God's ways are past our [Applause] ways and God's ways are past finding out Hallelujah so when when Jonathan went to the feast so was saying where is David and he was in Rage and he was taking the the spear wanted to kill Jonathan say you have conspired with the son of Jesse and I love how the Bible always mentions the son of Jesse the son of Jess because you know what David could not have been a great man if he had not had a grand father because remember when God made the coving with Abraham he said I know Abraham that he shall teach his children the word of God so Jesse was a great man and Jesse would SE his children at evening and say I'm going to read you a Bible story God came down in the pillow of fire and he said let there be light so Jesse was a great father Jesse was not the kind of father that was taking his his children to a boxing match Jesse was not the kind of father who was taking his sons to an NBA Stadium Jesse was the Holy Ghost father Hallelujah Jesse was a Bible father because a father is a priest and Jesse was a spoken word eag anointed Holy Ghost fi father amen amen how many fathers we need tonight like Jess who would set their boys and say boys let me tell you a story Hallelujah one day there was a man called Congressman upshore he was cre he was Creed for 68 years and God spoke and he he walked again how many fathers do we have in these last days glory to God PR but but Jesse was a great man and David was the son of Jesse Hallelujah and now and the prophet talks in the message called leadership he says I can see amam coming back from work and probably his wife would massage his back from where he was working as a slave and then after dinner he would go climb up and he would begin to pray for Redemption AMR was in the order of Jess he was a great father Hallelujah he was not too tired to Worship the Lord amran was not the kind of man who say you know what I'm a slave who cares I've been working all day I worked 12 hours at McDonald's I'm not going to go to church amran was not the kind of man so David so Jonathan shot the arrow and he cried out and he says is not the arrow beyond the and David knew the the mystery that he was not going to be accepted back in the palace he had to run away and sometimes when God when you receive Christ he he sends you away whenever sometimes God you have an experience with the Holy Ghost you don't go back to the Palace to leave the soft life God sends you in the wilderness God sends you to [Applause] battle and David if he was not a strong man this could have discouraged him how can you be anointed king and then this one this man says the arrows are too far from sh and I want you to know that we are living in a time where people are getting discouraged suicide is at the highest in the history of our country in the history of the world because you know what people are giving up people are saying you know what these arrows are are just beyond me this is this is too much for me that's right what is the point Hallelujah people are just giving up and giving up suicide is the extreme case of it but many times when we give up we might not necessarily take our life you may be in your home but you have given up on your marriage you could be sitting on the Pew but your mind has given up already on the on the things of God hallelujah you could wake up in the morning take a shower go to work but you have already given up that's right and that's like 98% of when you lose the fighting [Applause] Spirit but I want to tell you tonight don't give up don't give up my brother don't give up my brother don't give up because you know what the arrows are not too far from Thee the kingdom is near unto thee even in th mouth others they're just coming to church but they've given up you know people used to worry about their dressing they used to worry about their conduct but now people have given up they don't care whatever comes wherever they invited people have given up the [Music] fight that's why the prophet preached a message called spiritual Amnesia is you forget who you are and you just and you just give up you come in ch Church during song surface you're not even singing you you have just given up you're just sitting like [Music] this have you ever seen homeless people sometimes they have given up on life they're just sitting on the bridge like this there's no ambition there's no reading the Bible there's no praying there's no fighting whatever happens I don't care I don't care I don't care and this was meant to discourage David to give up on the kingdom to say you know what why should I want to be a king this is too hard for me let me just live an ordinary life why should I worry about becoming bride let me let me just be like the Baptist let me just like just be like the rest of the Nations and you know what you give up on your possession and you give up on your inheritance but God does not want you to give up on your because you know what the Bible says the land shall never be sold forever if God gives you you can't even sell it even if you sold it it had to be redeemed because you cannot sell it forever so even if you give up God is not going to give up on you because the L cannot be sold forever it belongs to God you belong to God you belong to [Applause] God those are the laws of redemption the law the land cannot be sold forever because it is mine so God says you cannot be sought forever because you are mine Hallelujah you belong to Jesus that's why when you try to run away you found yourself coming back you Tred to go away you found yourself coming back because you belong to Jesus because Jesus will leave 99 and go after you says where is Kelly where is yed where is Edward where is stepen come back my son come back you used to pray three times a day and you stopped you know what God is calling you back come back to your position come back to your place you used to sing special songs and he stopped God is saying come back come back you cannot sell the land Forever This Is Your Land Jerusalem belongs to Judah there is no other person that can take your place the devil will tell you don't don't go to church don't worry brother robbers will be there your place is Irreplaceable the Millennium cannot start without you why are we here why are we here amen we are looking for the last seat amen we are looking for the last seat amen there is no one that can replace the last seed no sir God can say you know what I think this this is enough God is waiting for the last seat amen amen he could be in Somalia eating guavas under a tree we have to wait for him that's it that's it that's it that's it on the earth they'll say final boarding call God is no final boarding call if your name is z you got to be there amen amen amen amen yes Glory Hallelujah the prophet says my father was a rider yes and he went West breaking horses uhuh and he met my mother they were married right you know because that they met in the west and he was about 18 and one was 14 or 16 and the prophet talks about breaking horses yes my brother if it's a wild horse uhh you have to break it to domesticate it that's exactly right so to break the horse it's not not to physically break the horse no sir is to break the spirit of the horse amen so the enemy does not is not after your flesh he wants to break your spirit because the offenses and the discouragement in the Christian faith they are meant to to break your spirit because once go once once the devil breaks your spirit then you give up on your [Applause] testimony because remember will you overcome by the by by your testimony because Jesus Christ is the high priest of our confession the prophet says your salvation will last as long as your faith will last and your healing will last as long as your faith will last but the devil is after your testimony that's why he came to Jesus he says if thou be the Son of God says you know what if you can just change your testimony I'll give you all the kingdoms I'll give you Paris I'll give you London I'll give you New York Jesus Christ said I don't want it for free I'm going to pay for it and if you are a true born again eego you don't want things for free you count the cost and you say I'm going to pay for it I'm going to pay for it you count the cost Jesus Christ said if if if you're going to build a house you have to sit down and count the cost Netflix okay I can pay that makeup I can pay that shorts I can pay that I can pay that NFL the price is high but I'll pay [Applause] it a real believer sits down and count the cost that's why people go back because they don't count the cost Ruth could not go back Naomi tried to paint the picture for her says listen there's nothing for youo there but she says you know what I am going with you anyhow I'll take my choice with [Music] [Applause] you but the devil wants to break your spirit by discouraging you to say you know what the arrows are too far from you you can never be like brother brandham you can never be like brother sa and saw you are a weakling the arrows are Beyond you you that's what the devil does and people just give up you make one mistake say you not you're not part of the Bride you have crossed the line you never be a good preacher you never be a real believer you you have got many weaknesses that's the enemy right there because Christ does not save you on the basis of what you do he saves you because he loves you and he chose you and no matter what you do he will love you [Applause] anyhow but the devil is on a rampage discouraging people people are just sitting at home they're not going back to the barrooms they're not coming to church they just discouraged I don't like what what the pastor said to me that other day I don't like how my my case was handled and you just give up the prophet says so many have become offended so many people get offended so easy at the word of God it's contrary they want to lean to their own understanding they don't want to take the word of the lord it's like the days of Judges everyone had their own personal revelation because there was no Prophet when there was no Prophet the judge is rude you can do whatever you want this one does this this one does this but when the prophet comes there's a light and when the light comes we walk not in darkness but we walk in the light as he is the light second Timothy chapter chapter 2:3 thou therefore inure hardness as a good soldier of Jesus Christ don't give up don't become weary inure hardness Hallelujah these days just somebody takes some a Brother's seat doesn't want to come to church I mean how can you be a good soldier I see you said for you to be a soldier you go through a Marine training or some other how many how many how many veterans do we have in this place God bless you veterans if you're a soldier you they have to they have to strengthen your spirit they take you from being a civilian to be a soldier they will put you different kind of situations so that you can have a strong Spirit they'll take you to Alaska they'll put you in the cold they'll put you in the sea all kinds of things depending on where you are stationed you could be an NC you could be a marine you could be this and the training depends depends on on where you are that's right and my training and your training may be different maybe I'm I'm in every maybe you are something else right so you have to accept your training because Christ knows that you have to graduate as a [Applause] seal because God wants you to to handle the the the the the the the Bazooka God wants you to to handle the you know what do they call them those big guns RPG yes God wants you to launch the intercontinental ballistic MCE but you just want to be a security guard with a stick with a stick come on my brother there's more for you there's more for you my sister there's more for you my brother there's so much landar to be [Applause] possessed don't be cheap that's why even if an unbeliever comes you say I can't be married to an unbeliever because you know what I'm me the Marines I'm a n seal I'm a NY seal I handle big guns I don't play with small toys I hand the big GL oh come on [Applause] Church Hallelujah if you are a young man have high Ambitions and say I am a son of milis I don't play with cheap [Applause] stuff oh come on Church [Music] Hallelujah you must know your worth you must know your [Applause] worth under no circumstance must a Believer marry an unbeliever under no circumstance means even even if there's one left it's still under no circumstance [Applause] [Music] because the lion no matter how hungry the lion is it will die of hunger it will never eat grass like the baffalo a lion will die a lion an eag will die an [Applause] eagle I'm telling you the ego will die an eego take your time take your time that's why God says Judah my son thou art a lion swp from the from the couch my son Thou Art gone up as an old lion who shall arouse him Judah Hallelujah you must have high Ambitions you must you must be soaring very high as an eagle don't mess with the chicken down here stay up [Applause] there someone says someone says Aaron did you watch the mesh I said I don't understand American football but I understand the Bible I understand the Bible [Music] Hallelujah I'm very sorry Brothers Luke 8 verse 49 let's open our Bibles Luke 8 vers vers verse 49 an eego stays in the sky and the angels which kept not their place God bound them with Everlasting change because God wants people who stay in their position you will never see Judah being given in the land of of Ephraim God wants you to stay in your place and to die in your place Luke 8 verse 49 while he yet SP they cometh they cometh the ruler of the synagogue's house saying unto him thy daughter is dead trouble not the master you see how the devil discourages people this man was a r ruler of the synagogue and he was a secret believer and God knows how to fish out the secret Believers he will send a sickness and this man being a ruler of the synagogue he had all the contacts in the city he had he knew the people that ran the best hospitals he knew all the best pediatrics but all those people could not help him and and and and and and and and one day he remembered you know what there's a man that we I've been somebody gave me his tapes I've been listening to his tapes I'm going to call upon him even if it's contrary to our church I'm going to call upon that man and he says you know what I'm going to go there I'm not going to send anyone I'm going to go myself because there's nothing painful for a parent than to hear your child coughing and you can't help them you try Tylenol you try this you try this nothing works you can't even go to sleep you hear them coughing in the night just losing weight wasting away you try everything that you you try everything God is working something and when gyrus said you know what I'm going to call the prophet of Nazareth let me call him so he went to the other cost and he found him and one thing I like about Jesus when you call him he's going to say yes God says yes God is not like a man if you go to a man and say can you help me you said to give you a lecture you know me I did this this I went through this remember what you did this to me God is not like that when you call upon God you will come so so gyrus went straight to Jesus never went he went straight to Jesus so when he found Jesus just like all of us when we find Jesus we say now everything is okay I found on Jesus my situation is going to be changed oh this man has worked many miracles but whilst he was walking with Jesus bad news come sometimes bad news comes when you are walking with Jesus that doesn't mean there's anything wrong with you bad news can come when you are walking with Jesus but when you are walking with Jesus when the bad news comes Jesus hears it Jesus hears the best news Jesus reads the email Jesus goes to the mailbox with you and he looks at a letter and he reads [Applause] it because he is there with you David says Thou Art with me David was convinced that Jesus Christ was with him all the [Music] [Applause] time and Jesus says and this person came says don't travel the master don't waste your time going to church don't waste your time reading the spoken word the daughter is dead this situation cannot be helped don't waste your time don't even call the pastor your marriage will never be remedied your children will never come to the Lord your daughter is dead that's what the devil want us to believe that your situation is remedy but when Jesus heard it Hallelujah when Jesus heard it Jesus hears he says my ears are not heavy that I cannot hear neither is my hand too short that I cannot save Jesus Christ he is he answered him saying fear not only believe that's why we sing the song only believe she shall be made Hall and they went and when they came into the house he suffered no man to go in sometimes you don't have to go with a lot of people the angel told the prophet you are walking with too many people for me to work with you God is not in numbers God is in individuals but we are living in a time of groups WhatsApp groups Tik Tok groups Instagram groups God is not interested in that's a denomination God works with individuals yes my brother clicks but when he went into the house he suffered that no man go in except faith hope and love it took brother Roberts brother kley and brother Seth amen and the father and the mother of the maiden and all wept am and bewailed her yes sir but he said weep not she is not dead but sleepeth Hallelujah but listen there were people that were there the Bible says they wept and they welled but if you read verse 53 it says they loved him to scorn when he says listen she's sleeping she's going to be well they went from weeping to [Applause] laughing they they were sending each other memes says can you believe this take your brother stage one weeping stage two laughing laughing [Applause] this shows that their condition they were backing because these were supposed to be Jews who knew the spoken word who knew that God sends prophets God can heal God can raise can raise the dead but the fact that they were laughing it shows that it shows how far they have been from the Lord hallelujah and he and verse verse verse 44 the Bible says and he put them all out yes sir Jesus Christ attitude towards unbelief has never changed he would put it all out and the prophet says how do you apply the token you take all the trash out all the television out all the minets out that's how you apply the toen it's a quat Jesus he put them all out and he took her by the hand and called and said maid arise am and the Spirit came again and she Rose straight away let me give you a testimony there was a brother who had a who had a daughter who has a daughter she's about maybe 10 so the she was she was playing you know how kids like to draw the driveway and playing so the wife didn't notice that hey it was in the evening that the girls were playing so she begged she was begging she she was baking out she had a very large SUV I think it's the Nissan Amada and as she was baking out she she had a scream she ran on top of of the girl and it was so bad so they called they had to call the helicopter and the helicopter lifted up this this lady from her place straight to LaVine children's home because they had to act quickly so because we we live close by you know we were called we went there and we prayed and this scripture came came to my heart I said made right taluma the Lord Health you I said sister I know you're young but do you believe Jesus can heal you she says yes Jesus can heal me says do you believe with all your heart I'm going to pray for you it's according to your faith it has got nothing to do with the preacher it's nothing to do with an anointed preacher it's all about your faith you we we give people too much credit oh brother and no pray to God God will hear your prayers sometimes Brother s s preach the power is in your hands amen you just call upon the Lord yes sir brother Bram told a woman that your situation changed because that mother when she prayed for your baby exactly right we are not Catholics we believe all the power is in a in a bishop or in a pastor sometimes you don't even need to call the pastor at midnight pray with your husband and send the testimony and say pastor we prayed and the demon [Applause] left sometimes you don't you don't even need to call the Deacon there are situations where you need to do that to call the Elders sometimes just find brother close by Brother there's a situation come let's pray the prophet says a church that is well taught knows how to do that the prophet says when I was away the elders prayed for a dead person and he came back to [Applause] life in choosing of a bride so so we prayed and they did I don't know whether it was 40 multiple scans I forgot dozens of dozens of scans they said this is unbelievable that's it there is nothing that's it we are discharging you she went back home she had nothing Hallelujah Jesus Christ breaks the F Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever Hallelujah are the arrows Beyond you tonight the Kingdom of Heaven is closed to you am amen but you know what the devil wanted to discourage Jas trouble not the master now let's I want to read the scripture here Job chapter 2 verse 9 job yes sir the B says then his wife said to him do you still cling to your God says ciss God and die in other words why do you trouble yourself just give up and whenever you hear that kind of speech just know that it's not from God it's of the devil because you know what God does not go back remember in the Book of Ezekiel when the living creatures Ezekiel Saw them yes sir he says they had eyes all over and they had four faces it says they turned not where they went says if they were going this way they were going forward if they were going this way they were going forward if they were going this way they were moving forward they turned not when they went which means that if you are a son of God everything works together for good you are never going back whatever happens you are moving forward no [Applause] reverse and he says Cur God and die and job job says you speak like a foolish woman you want she wanted she wanted to discourage Jo that's what it is it's all about discouragement oh that long skirt you look like an old lady take your time I saw I was reading a new news article where they were trying to bring legislation against Big T says because many girls are being affected and a lot of them are are committing suicide because they look at people at Instagram they said how can I be like this I'm I'm I'm how can I ever come to be like this you know what that's the devil using those influencers who is influencing the influencers you see the prophet preached a message called influences six times or even more says you you can influence you have to be careful because there is no one who can just become an influencer for for for no reason the influencer will be sponsored by someone and the person who sponsors the influencer many times they are not really message Believers or Christians so the the juty of the influencer is to influence people yes sir and these people they are doing it to make money but you know what the devil is not interested in money really the devil is interested in SS of men because the Bible says whatever is highly esteemed in the world it's an Abomination unto the Lord that's a scripture I've seen people saying okay there's this group in on Facebook we have question and answers they say is he a deacon who ordained him where do you know his life which which scripture you you said this is that's the problem of the day people become attached to the virtual world to somebody that you have never met someone who who is who they create a WhatsApp group and they live somewhere I don't know in they live I don't know there are somewhere in chuya there in Zimbabwe you don't even know their life all they have is a smartphone some of them don't even go to church they were chased away from their churches but you know what they [Applause] influencers you see you have to come from the Bible even for me to come here brother stepen has to know my life I I I have a church that I go to I don't just come out of nowhere and start preaching no you have to go by the word I see people can I add to this group for what if I have a question I'll ask my pastor the Bible says women if you have a question ask your husband if the husband doesn't know he can ask the pastor Hallelujah but you know what people people want to ask virtual world because you see science moves with civilization now they have what what is called Vision Pro it's like you are in reality but you are interacting with another dimension because God says I will pour out my spirit in the last days and your young men shall see Visions because the anointing that was given and the word in this hour will be so high until one of these days we shall see the body of brother Bram just before the Rapture for a few days we shall see we shall see the Saints we shall interact with the with the next Dimension because of the anointing and the word that was given to us we are supposed to be interacting with our theophanies with Angelic beings but the enemy has gone behind and he's causing people to interact with another dimension through science Hallelujah but let me tell you something young man interact with the angels interact with with with angels with Dimensions with the Holy Ghost yes [Applause] because science and civilization travel together someone could be sitting there they are watching something on the Vision Pro but you know what after praying in the morning you could be sitting in the office but you could be in a different dimension Hallelujah Angels descending and ascending upon the sons of God GL GL GL [Applause] [Music] Hallelujah my time is running out oh my John 3: 26 let's open this one I like the sound of Bibles being turns nothing is sweeter than the the the Turning of of The Bible Pages don't feel bad if you have a digital Bible [Applause] the Bible says the letter kth so I like the letter all right 3:26 the Bible says and they came unto John who is they they came unto John and said unto him Rabbi he that was with you beyond Jordan done he that was in your church the one that left your church to whom you baptized you led to Christ behold behold the same baptizeth and all men come to him amen I forgot to finish this the third stage was they were astonished if you go back to the scripture those were St but anyway going back to this scripture these people went to John and they said the man that you baptized he's gaining more followers than you what do you think this was meant to do unto John because when John baptized Jesus all the people left and they followed Christ but you know what a true servant of God always leads people to Christ and it does it does not offend you where people as long as they are going to Christ I'm okay with that we are happy with that remember the the Servants of lot and the Servants of Abraham they were fighting over over over over the Sheep but you know what none of that was theirs it belonged to Abraham and it belonged to lot you see ministers [Applause] fighting but these are not your sheep this sheep belong to God you are just a Shepherd these are not your sheep [Applause] if you ever going to a restaurant and then and then they say can you give me give me your keys and then they take your nice car they go and PK it the guy if he forgets that this is not his car he may become very comfortable but that is not your car you just parking that car so the flock is not ours but it belongs to God this is why I love brother Steven because he has got different Ministries coming here because he know that this is not about him it's about Christ he is leading people to Christ he's not binding people to himself say only listen to me I'm the only anointed one no sir it's about Jesus Christ so these came to John and they said and he said oh men come to him now if if John wasn't an eagle you could have gone in the flesh said oh okay can I tell you something about that man actually he's not a real Christian that man did this this this and this this this oh you know I'm the greatest born among women but John never say that he refused to be discouraged he refused to go in the flesh am and I want you to watch carefully the word word as I'm closing hallu says all men come to him now the devil likes to abuse the word oh men oh man oh everyone oh everyone is doing this this is supposed to make you feel like maybe maybe I'm crazy because you know what everyone is is going to watch this yeah every if everyone is putting makeup and the devil tell what's so special about you everyone is doing this everyone is following John I you have to watch those words the devil likes to to present something as if hey you're the only one out but if you are a true ego even if you're the only one you will still stand by your convictions but John said John answered and said a man can receive nothing except it be given him from Heaven hallelujah hallelujah I like that yes sir now Paul says here I'm going to read this scripture because my time is finished I fought a good fight yes sir I finished my I finished my course amen I have kept the faith Amen in other words he fought a good fight yes he finished the course and he he he kept the faith now in the book of Timothy where he Paul was writing he uses a word there was one time where he says You must keep let's open it 1 Timothy chapter 18 verse uh chapter 1 verse 18 it says some have Shipwrecked their faith because remember the devil wants to shipwreck your faith now of course to a to a real believer that that doesn't apply really but remember they are borderline Believers out there they are make Believers we just you know preach to a mixed multitude so we have to apply all the scriptures says this I charge the commit unto this son Timothy according to the prophecies uh which went before thee that thou must War a good Warfare holding faith and a good conscience which some having put away concerning Faith have made shipwreck right it says of whom is a hus in Alexandra whom I have delivered unto Satan that they learn not to blaspheme another scripture he says like he's blaspheming is saying the resurrection is passed so a wrong Doctrine can be Blasphemous that'sa a wrong Doctrine can be Blasphemous that's exactly right that's why when people started to say to the prophet you are the Christ he says I would rather die as a man than to die is an antichrist because that was a Blasphemous Doctrine that's why we believe that the ministry must continue we play the tapes but God also has raised people that can preach the gospel because you cannot put everything in one man even Jesus Christ he said unless the corn of wheat Force to the ground and multiply it abide it alone even Jesus did not want to do it alone by himself he says I must be glorified so that I can come back to [Music] you because remember Hallelujah the Vindication of a of a son of man is the book of Acts because remember what what followed What followed Moses take your time what followed Moses it was Joshua right what is Joshua holy spirit it's the Ephesians it's the Holy Ghost right this is the Ephesians right what what is Ephesians is the dividing of the land now why would you need the land if you're just going to be sitting in the church just playing TS and doing nothing you have to be placed in your position in Ephesians so the son of man Ministry is followed by the by the Son of God Ministry is the Holy Ghost so so when you have Jesus then you have the book of what the book of the book of Acts right right that's why the book of Acts is actually a continuation of the Book of Luke if you read let's open it the book of Acts is a continuation of the Book of Luke you can't say I only want Luke I don't want acts then you are denying the Bible friends you cannot make brother Bram contradict the Bible brother Bram was a scriptural prophet and brother brother Steven's most popular statement is the B this message is perfectly in line with the Bible Acts chapter one the former treaties have I began on have I made all all theop of all that Jesus began both to do and teach until the day which he was taken after right so so so the book the former treaties is the Book of Luke which is the ministry of the son of man which is this one but this is the letter treaty right the former treaty the book of Acts and the Book of Luke this is Moses in the wilderness and then this is Joshua which is your Ephesians and you cannot separate one from the other you cannot separate the prophet and the Bride Can We Stand upon our feet are you discouraged tonight God drops handfuls on purpose brother because he does not want Ruth to be discouraged that's why God sent a Revival that's why there's a brother who says brother can you come and have this because many shall be offended the Bible says that because the night was long The Virgins they became drowsy and they became weary and they began to sleep until a a a voice went out says arise and trim your lamps that was the voice of the Resurrection the message of the hour but they were becoming drowsy they were becoming discouraged see people becoming discouraged going to church is no longer fashionable even coming to church people are just thinking about something else Hallelujah but God he's still upon the throne am and he knows what he's doing when the enemy tells you the arrow is far from thee say no the kingdom is of God is closed by Brother Branham when the field was flooded and many people you can play something softly and many people were going out to preach the invitation started to become low because know the F everyone was doing impersonating him and people were writing letters to him to discourage him they said you are washed up change your ministry and then you start to have many people coming to you and he was writing back to them he said I'm no I'm not washed up I know exactly where I'm standing and he and he preached the message the present stage of my Ministry and that was around June maybe July and says when my Ministry is here I know that it's ready to be crowned and a few months after that that's when the angel came and they opened the seals to sh but before that he was getting discouragements and discouragements always come right before the victory Hallelujah don't be discouraged the devil tell you look there's no boys there are no boys in church what is the point try something else try try try to use an app download this app try to find people try when never try to do something Hallelujah when Abraham tried to do something he came with ishma that's exactly is is a wild man it's a testimony but it's a wild testimony but you stay right with the word and you wait upon the promise am don't say oh there are no girls in my church what can I do maybe I should try this just wait upon the Lord they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength they shall Mount up with wings as the eagles they shall run and they shall walk and not be weary they shall run and not faint says teach me Lord teach me Lord to wait upon you this is an age where everything has to be instant instant food fast food but God is not like that God in his time he makes all things beautiful shall we pray Heavenly Father we thank you tonight Lord for your promises are real oh God lord when we feel sometimes that you are far from us then you are very very very near to our hearts and near to our lives how that sometimes oh God even the disciples they were at Sea and and it looked like they were going to sink and they said Master can not that we perish and you Rose up and you said peace be still you were there in the boat Lord the floods was there the hurricane was there but you were there in the boat you were sleeping you were resting when they came upon the shore when they were when they were toiling all night and they couldn't catch anything they were discouraged but you came to them and you said cast your net into the deep and Peter says we have tried everything but Lord you knew what they needed when you came they found you upon the shore he said children are you hungry do you need any meat and you gave them bread and fish upon the fire you knew exactly what they needed when the prophet was hunting you said you don't you need a squirrel I can give you a squirrel and tonight you are the same Lord you can Pro provide for our needs you know what the young sisters need you know what the young Brothers need you know what the old those that are seeking the baptism of the Holy Ghost you know exactly what they need uh there are some that are looking for children there are some tonight who are claiming their children under under the token father you are still the same uh may you grant it to them Lord father you know the desire in brother Steven's heart is to see this church on fire Having the Holy Ghost moving throughout the whole church touching everyone will you give him the desire of his heart after laboring for for All This Time Lord may you just anoint him more once more father and anoint the church Lord we are just giving our request to you tonight that father you give us the spirit of Grace and supplication be with us oh Lord and strengthen us for the journey as you came to Elijah and you gave him a cake and you said arise and eat for the journey is great before you as you came to Ruth and you encourage you with handfuls of purpose may you grant it tonight Lord in the name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ we pray amen God bless you [Applause] church thank you hallelujah hallelujah amen amen amen amen some body encourage tonight amen glory to God what I love about him is he knows how to surrender to the spirit and let the Holy Spirit work to every Avenue and touch his children where he wanted to teach I know someone was touched tonight somebody was strengthened tonight somebody who was down the Holy Spirit strengthen you somebody who's not here who's streaming the Holy Spirit warn you be patient everything is all right and sometime the answers of God comes when everything is almost going down that's when the greatest testimony is coming you know when you follow somebody and will you stay around maybe someone a long time do not be somebody who's taken up by distractions God put you with someone for a purpose and if you lose that experience you might be losing your training so meaning whenever you come to this church whatever the Lord has been doing here the Lord has been training you because there is a task that is ahead so if the way you see the word operating that's the way you should be operating you cannot be here for 3 years and you're still acting the same way you were before we even start this church it mean you are not progressing it means something is wrong so that has been said before you jump into anything young adult young people begin to examine things the way we examine how did your pastor train you he train you in the Bible and the message of the hour whatever the pastor is trying to do in the church he always try to back it up by the Bible by the message of the hour it's a training that I'm giving to all of you so that whenever you want to do something in your life always look and sit down and say what has the word say is there any Scripture here can I call a brother can I call an older sister and say do you know if brother Bram ever say something about this or can I call the pastor and say brother Stephen I'm trying to do this what does the word says about this because when you know what the will of God is it give you confidence then you know that what you're doing is fine and if the devil ever rise up against you you can stand and fight him because you're not venturing into an Uncharted Territory but you know exactly what you're doing so even those groups that they say young people groups before you join a group stop and ask a question and most of the time when you Chace those group you will find out that it's handled by an individual and there is no supervision of a pastor no supervision a deacon it was just young people that got around and put a group there and you are doomed for a disaster if you are in something like that you need to come out because you are discussing things you don't know and you can swallow things you don't understand one time I was chasing something really popular in the message and I was tracing it and I trace it and I say who's responsible for and I thought he was a minister he was this Minister it was this Min at the end of the day there was no Pastor supervising this and I stop I say so who's assigning the people they say it is brother so and so and I took his number and I begin to trace him on social media and I begin to study him when he post something I take a screenshot and if I show you what I see from that brother I wonder how with the level of spirituality he has he can handle young people all over the country in the message because he himself is struggling with a lot of stuff based on what I have been saying so you have been directed or you have been led by somebody who's struggling himself amen so before they put you somewhere stop that oh they say oh there is a choir stop the choir who is there who is responsible of that choir is the pastor who is the pastor is there does your pastor know about this group if your pastor know my pastor need to know so then we can trace one another and we stay and make sure everything is good but not oh we young people meet and then okay the young people are going to uh join the young people over there that's join for what join for what people know my number ministers know my number why they don't call me why they call you they know my number they know the address and I know this is online if somebody want to address this church you send it to me you send it to this church you m it we have brother that I mean I have never even seen but they mail the invitation to me and then when I look I say okay now I see who they are I need to investigate who is this church then I will say okay let's go ahead and post it on the buletin board anyone who have time to go they can go but they cannot contact you because they know my number why are they going on back why are you trying to get from the back door you know my number yes sir amen so whenever they give you an invitation don't pop it up here you come with that toward me and let me investigate because I'm very jealous of you I know what is up there I don't play game and I have zero tolerance because I don't want to put you into a church and you come back with a spirit I cannot do that I cannot sanction something that I'm not quiet sure with it because I don't want to go there and before you know you come up with 20 question was that right was that right was that right I don't want that but if I look I say that's good go ahead and go with it I don't have any problem with that I'm not saying we are the only Pebble on the beach no we have brothers and sisters we have good churches around us but we know one another amen so whenever something happen stay a little be a little bit cautious nowadays before you jump into something be cautious parent check your children Facebook look what they're posting amen amen get off this chat group you've been there 5 years what what did he help you on your spiritual life did you increase your Holy Ghost matter of fact you down and you have to be responding to everything that has been posted there what are they posting there what are they doing is it a friendship okay but what is this one going on okay the people from Arizona people from Minnesota people from uh California people from the and then 120 people who's supervising this you put yourself into a trouble and before you do it somebody is influencing somebody and they're going to drop something and before you know it your postor duty he's here you not here you somewhere there a sir amen how many times did they left their church and come to your church am how many times did they come and see you how many times did they took a flight and travel to come and see you how many times did they do that I'm not saying we're not fellowshipping I'm teaching you to stand on your ground and to have what they call a character and a confidence not somebody who's following everyone and just going with the wind and this is going on here we need to be there no no no no no no slow down you are young adult adult any decision can get you in trouble you need to stay focused amen amen God doesn't want you to be discouraged hold on to your profession something good is just about to
