[37:45] we will be working on having like five
[37:48] groups

[37:51] you have to do it
[37:52] only twice a year to the most three
[37:56] times
[37:57] but most of the time it's gonna be
[37:59] you're gonna be working only twice

[38:20] we pay for the tent if we have to rent a
[38:23] tent or anything
[38:24] we take care of it but we won't grab i
[38:27] mean
[38:27] i'll rob you from all the blessings we
[38:30] leave
[38:30] just the dessert and the setting up
[38:33] and the breaking down to you so if you
[38:36] want to gain some blessing from the lord
[38:38] just bring a lot of dessert just get in
[38:41] one of the group
[38:42] on one or twice a year you set up and
[38:44] you break it out
[38:45] then we share the blessing the church
[38:47] get the blessings
[38:48] by supporting the meal and everything
[38:50] and you also
[38:52] get the blessing and we share the burden
[38:54] but the
[38:55] financial burden on its all is
[38:58] completely
[38:58] on the church we don't want to put it on
[39:00] you because it's a spiritual thing
[39:02] we want it to be a blessing amen we're
[39:05] going to do this over and over and over
[39:08] and over
[39:08] until we get deep into certain things
[39:11] and teach you
[39:12] how to listen to the prophet
[39:15] amen because sometimes we put the tip
[39:17] and we
[39:18] get it like a slip pill you just put a
[39:20] tape and you go to sleep
[39:22] that's not the way you listen to the
[39:24] prophet you can do this
[39:25] all year and you will never get anything
[39:28] you might just get a little glance or
[39:29] something like that
[39:30] no you might just get the bible oh
[39:32] brother brother i'm saying we need to
[39:33] read the bible
[39:34] uh a chapter in the morning and in
[39:36] chapter nine you just get the bible and
[39:38] then glance it and you really don't get
[39:40] it
[39:41] you need to be in a certain atmosphere
[39:43] come
[39:44] when you read the scripture and you
[39:46] might be reading just
[39:47] one verse you learned that from your
[39:50] pastor right
[39:51] just one verse and you can hang on the
[39:54] entire day just circling on that one
[39:57] verse
[39:58] and that one verse will pull this one
[40:00] here pull this one here
[40:01] pull this one here then the word will be
[40:04] unfolded to you amen
[40:06] so we don't want you just to get on a
[40:08] routine this is not a religion
[40:10] this is a life it is not a routine we're
[40:13] going to listen to the tape you just go
[40:14] ahead
[40:15] put play and then you're thinking about
[40:16] something else no when you listen to the
[40:19] tape
[40:19] there could be something there if you
[40:21] just go calm
[40:23] maybe 20 minutes you might be able to
[40:25] stop that tip
[40:26] and when you get what you get in 20
[40:28] minutes all is already
[40:29] overflowing you then you stop the tip
[40:32] you meditate on that you feed on that
[40:34] then you come back again
[40:35] and you click it and you start going on
[40:37] amen that way
[40:39] it's going to be a benefit versus a
[40:41] routine just go ahead and put in your
[40:43] mind is there

[41:50] wednesday
[41:52] amen blessed be the name of the lord
[41:56] i hate when i talk to somebody and
[41:58] they're like
[41:59] four weeks behind i'm wondering
[42:02] where are you amen
[42:05] and sometimes the things that the left
[42:08] are the very thing they're struggling
[42:10] with
[42:11] and here the lord already provided an
[42:14] answer but they just don't listen
[42:17] amen you cannot go five
[42:21] weeks without listening to what has been
[42:24] preaching in the church
[42:25] something is wrong amen you gotta stop
[42:29] your life
[42:30] and find out what is wrong amen
[42:34] you can miss a service or two and you
[42:36] catch up but if you miss the first
[42:38] sermon the second sermon
[42:39] the third sermon the fourth sermon and
[42:41] you coming on the sixth sermon
[42:43] what are you really gonna get amen what
[42:46] are you doing at home how do you budget
[42:48] your time
[42:50] i can give you a quote brother branham
[42:52] say we are prostituting our time
[42:55] how are you budgeting your time why do
[42:57] you have time to do
[42:58] everything else except stopping
[43:02] and listening to the word we put it on
[43:04] youtube you don't want to listen
[43:05] we bring you to church you don't want to
[43:07] come to church we put it on your iphone
[43:09] you don't want to do it so what else do
[43:11] you want me to do
[43:15] check the condition of your heart don't
[43:17] fool yourself
[43:18] because challenges are it's getting
[43:21] really hot
[43:25] it's getting really really hot
[43:28] i hope ministers in the message are
[43:30] catching it
[43:31] because you will reach a point where
[43:33] that religion won't hold anymore
[43:35] amen you're going to be tired of holding
[43:37] yourself up to live like a christian
[43:39] like a christian like a christian
[43:41] after a while you're going to blow up
[43:44] because you didn't have the real thing
[43:47] genesis chapter 1 verse 27
[43:52] we preach we stop so you can go home you
[43:55] digest then we add it then we stop then
[43:57] you go home you judge us then we add
[43:59] so if you you miss six meal
[44:03] can you do six days without eating
[44:07] and you go a whole month without
[44:10] listening to a sermon
[44:13] how is your spiritual health
[44:17] under nourishment
[44:20] genesis chapter 1 verse 27 if you dare
[44:23] you can say amen
[44:27] this message you can take one scripture
[44:29] and just
[44:30] keep opening one scripture over and over
[44:33] and over and over you know just one
[44:34] scripture
[44:35] you think you preach about it then
[44:37] something pop up just for more idea
[44:41] verse 27 so god
[44:45] created man
[44:48] did the bible say he created a woman
[44:53] [Laughter]
[44:56] uh god sister don't worry you there
[45:06] did god created a woman
[45:10] you need to listen to brother branham
[45:12] very carefully
[45:16] so god created who
[45:19] man
[45:24] when i'm gonna go back in the scripture
[45:26] you're gonna see how paul
[45:27] says the same thing
[45:31] and you think brother branham was
[45:32] adamant
[45:36] when so god created man
[45:40] in his own water
[45:44] this man was created in the
[45:47] very image of god
[45:50] you might be seated
[45:54] so if you have never seen god
[46:01] you need to look at man
[46:12] when you see man you see god
[46:17] that's why when god came in flesh
[46:22] in the person of jesus christ he came
[46:25] as a man not a woman
[46:33] [Laughter]
[46:36] don't worry this world is under the
[46:40] influence
[46:41] of rome rome came to the united states
[46:45] and entering with the beast of
[46:47] revelation 13
[46:49] and that beast is giving his anointing
[46:52] all over the world
[46:54] because everybody that her name are not
[46:56] written in the lamb's book of life must
[46:58] worship
[46:59] the beast so all that anointing is
[47:02] worldwide so whatever is happening in
[47:05] america now is happening
[47:07] everywhere if you look at my country the
[47:11] way
[47:12] uh people are singing they just copying
[47:15] everything the way american people are
[47:19] singing
[47:20] i can give you a video of somebody
[47:22] singing amazing grace
[47:24] in over in africa in my country they
[47:26] don't even know how to speak english
[47:29] but when they sing amazing grace you
[47:31] think she's an american
[47:35] and the main thing i'm trying to point
[47:38] to you
[47:39] is that that spirit of the
[47:41] principalities
[47:43] of america is dominating the world
[47:46] and that spirit is a woman
[47:50] dominating spirit
[47:53] do you hear me then what we're trying to
[47:56] do is to get you
[47:57] off of that spirit
[48:03] and i know what i'm fighting against
[48:07] i know so don't look at me as african
[48:11] look at me as message believer
[48:14] amen because it's very easy he's from
[48:17] africa that's why he's saying that if
[48:20] it's so
[48:20] then your prophet was an african
[48:22] [Laughter]
[48:29] hallelujah so god created
[48:32] man in his own image
[48:36] karma in the image of
[48:39] god created he water
[48:43] him but
[48:48] male and water
[48:54] male and female
[49:00] so you want to see the woman where are
[49:02] you going to see her
[49:06] [Laughter]
[49:10] male and female created heat water
[49:14] them hold on sister
[49:18] you'll be all right we're just putting
[49:21] everything back
[49:22] the picture the right way then you're
[49:23] going to see christ
[49:25] genesis 2 verse 18.
[49:28] you there and the lord god
[49:32] say it is not good
[49:36] that the whole the man should be water
[49:42] who say that do you think god just spoke
[49:46] it just like that
[49:48] he knew inside man it was double
[49:53] because when he created everything male
[49:55] female
[49:56] male female male female male female then
[49:59] he created man
[50:01] then he thought okay everything looked
[50:03] good okay man you go ahead and you
[50:05] handle everything
[50:07] then after a while he looked at him he
[50:10] said
[50:12] something is not good now the power of
[50:15] the woman comes
[50:18] okay there's a sister say amen
[50:22] amen and the lord said it is not good
[50:26] that the man should be alone
[50:31] i will make him a helper
[50:36] meet for water so the woman
[50:39] is coming as a help
[50:46] you miss that you messed up your
[50:48] marriage
[50:51] a woman when she comes in your life
[50:54] she's coming
[50:55] for a help not to destroy you
[50:59] if a woman destroys you that's dela
[51:06] amen rahab hides
[51:09] the spices and when they try to destroy
[51:13] the spies
[51:15] rahab will protect the spies but delilah
[51:18] will not protect you
[51:20] she's going to expose you
[51:24] i wish the whole church was here this
[51:27] morning
[51:28] and those who miss make sure you get it
[51:31] amen hallelujah
[51:35] verse 19 and out of the ground the lord
[51:39] god
[51:40] formed every beast of the field
[51:43] and every fire of the air and brought
[51:46] them to whom so this man
[51:49] had a name his name was who
[51:55] adam praise god
[52:00] adam amen to see what he would call them
[52:05] and whatsoever adam called
[52:08] every living creature that was the name
[52:12] thereof in other words when adam spoke
[52:15] god don't change it
[52:18] because adam was a son of god
[52:22] remember created in the image and the
[52:25] likeness of who
[52:28] amen blessed be the name of the lord
[52:32] verse 20. and adam gave name to
[52:35] our caddo and to the foul of the earth
[52:38] and to every beast of the field but
[52:42] for adam there was not found a
[52:46] water right here again
[52:50] help a help meet for him
[52:54] and the lord god caused a deep sleep not
[53:00] just asleep
[53:02] but that sleep must go deep
[53:06] into the deep
[53:12] a deep sleep in other words when he woke
[53:15] up under this anesthesia
[53:17] he didn't feel anything they got to put
[53:21] him in a good anesthetic
[53:24] because they have to perform a surgery
[53:28] so he can't feel it hallelujah
[53:32] oh my god and he slept
[53:35] under anesthesia
[53:39] and he took one of his water
[53:44] one of his ribs and closed up the flesh
[53:48] instead thereof so there was a surgery
[53:51] that was performed
[53:52] from the body of a man this man was put
[53:56] in a body and from that body
[53:59] god opened up and pulled a rib
[54:03] and that rib he made now the body
[54:06] of the woman from the river
[54:11] everybody clear blessed be the name of
[54:14] the lord
[54:15] and the rib which the lord has taken
[54:19] from man not the original product
[54:25] you follow me when god created adam he
[54:28] just spoke
[54:30] do you follow me and then something came
[54:34] up from the earth
[54:35] and stood up like this amen
[54:39] then god pick up the spirit of genesis 1
[54:42] 27
[54:43] and put it inside adam then adam begin
[54:46] to move
[54:48] amen then he was a human being then he
[54:51] began to move
[54:52] but the woman was not there amen when
[54:55] god
[54:55] created the elephant god spoke and the
[54:58] elephant came up and he put the spirit
[55:01] when god created the file of the air
[55:04] everything the bible just said
[55:06] that he created them from the earth just
[55:09] like
[55:09] adam he formed men from the earth but
[55:12] when he created the woman he never
[55:14] picked up the earth
[55:18] the message is perfectly in line with
[55:21] the scripture
[55:22] you follow me when it comes to the woman
[55:26] he took something that he already worked
[55:28] with
[55:31] not a first product
[55:34] not a raw product from the earth
[55:37] but a product from the product
[55:40] which is called the by-product
[55:43] [Music]
[55:44] you understand now then from that by
[55:47] product
[55:49] he created a woman
[55:52] you want to refuse that you are
[55:54] rejecting the word of god
[55:58] just forget about the bible amen so he's
[56:01] getting a bright
[56:03] product then from that by product
[56:06] he's making a woman every single thing
[56:10] the file of the air
[56:12] the beast of the field everything was
[56:15] created straight from earth
[56:17] put it up earth put it up adam in
[56:20] genesis 2 7
[56:21] from the dust off the ground look look
[56:23] let's go back i don't want you to say
[56:25] brother stephen
[56:26] genesis 2 7 and the lord god from who
[56:31] did he form a woman can you read your
[56:33] bible
[56:34] the lord god form who of the water
[56:39] now go to go go down to verse
[56:46] job two verse of uh the two verse 19
[56:50] again
[56:50] and out of the water the lord god form
[56:54] water
[56:56] and water do you see that now
[56:59] so everything else was created just like
[57:02] adam pumped from the earth out
[57:04] up from the earth out up from the earth
[57:06] out when it come to the woman
[57:09] he never created her from the earth he
[57:12] took another product
[57:13] and pulled a woman
[57:17] everything that came straight from the
[57:20] ground
[57:21] do you follow me were strong vessels
[57:31] amen but because a woman
[57:35] was pulled from something that god
[57:38] already manufactured and he take the
[57:42] product that was already worked with
[57:45] and he worked the second time
[57:48] do you follow me that's why peter said
[57:51] that
[57:52] women are what
[57:56] not the spirit of the woman but the
[57:59] water
[58:02] there it is
[58:06] you follow me so when the serpent comes
[58:14] is he going to enter by the strong
[58:16] vessel
[58:17] oh well there is weakness
[58:20] you understand now
[58:24] is it complicated
[58:28] verse 22 and the read which the lord god
[58:31] taken from men
[58:33] made he a water a woman
[58:37] and brought her to her to the man
[58:40] and adam saying this is not water
[58:47] bones of my
[58:50] flesh the human body and flesh of my
[58:55] she shall be called a water his woman a
[58:58] name
[59:01] his woman a name so
[59:04] eve was created but eve
[59:08] didn't have a name
[59:13] how was god calling eve
[59:20] somebody called it hallelujah when
[59:23] man was created where was eve
[59:28] amen and god called this man who
[59:32] so when god called adam
[59:42] hallelujah hallelujah
[59:46] she shall be called water
[59:49] woman because she was water
[59:52] woman means water
[59:57] clear woman means taken out of men
[1:00:01] therefore shall men leave his father and
[1:00:05] his mother
[1:00:06] and shackling to his wife and and there
[1:00:09] shall be water
[1:00:11] why are there one flesh because at the
[1:00:13] beginning they were all ready
[1:00:17] anybody here go to
[1:00:20] genesis chapter 3 verse 8.
[1:00:25] now men have seen ever clear
[1:00:29] done something that was wrong but
[1:00:32] at this stage the woman existed
[1:00:35] and the man existed who committed the
[1:00:38] transgression
[1:00:40] first who did it he was a woman right
[1:00:44] then adam came and just condoned to what
[1:00:47] the woman said they have a deed
[1:00:48] everybody clear so now god is coming

[1:05:54] [Music]
[1:05:56] when god speaks something does he take a
[1:05:58] break

[1:06:05] keep hearing brother brother say
[1:06:07] we must be man of our word
[1:06:10] brother branham said before you speak
[1:06:12] you need to feed to
[1:06:13] seven times
[1:06:19] hallelujah verse 3 a
[1:06:23] fair who oh man there is no
[1:06:26] redemption no changes if a woman also
[1:06:30] vow a vow to the lord and
[1:06:33] burn herself by a bound
[1:06:36] being in her water now
[1:06:40] moses want to say something this is the
[1:06:42] lord talking to moses
[1:06:44] that if a woman is
[1:06:47] giving pledging something number one
[1:06:50] if she is in her father's house in other
[1:06:54] words
[1:06:54] if she is under her water remember on
[1:06:57] wednesday
[1:06:58] the head of the woman is who and the
[1:07:01] redhead of man is who
[1:07:03] and the head of christ is who and god
[1:07:06] encouraged her
[1:07:07] thank you love this church amen
[1:07:12] if a woman also vow a vow to the lord
[1:07:15] and burn herself by a bunch being in her
[1:07:17] father's
[1:07:18] house in her what when you're still
[1:07:21] younger
[1:07:23] you've not married it
[1:07:27] youth i can do my own thing
[1:07:31] amen and her father hears her vow
[1:07:35] and her bond wherewith she has burned
[1:07:38] her soul
[1:07:39] and her father shall hold his water in
[1:07:42] other words if
[1:07:43] daddy doesn't say nothing
[1:07:47] not the woman the man when he spoke
[1:07:50] taken finish
[1:07:56] but if a young woman and her father
[1:07:59] speak we still have to deal with
[1:08:02] somebody
[1:08:05] not the woman the father
[1:08:10] you follow me not you young sister
[1:08:13] daddy you can vow
[1:08:17] 20 000 things you want to the one who
[1:08:20] put a seal
[1:08:25] it's not you i can decide my own life
[1:08:30] let me pull you back to the bible
[1:08:35] amen may the holy spirit
[1:08:38] open your heart so you
[1:08:41] guys can receive it especially those
[1:08:44] that are missing now
[1:08:45] that's going to come later on amen
[1:08:49] and he shall hold his piece of hair then
[1:08:52] all her vows shall do what so if
[1:08:55] daddy doesn't say something it's
[1:08:58] automatically
[1:08:59] approved in other words daddy
[1:09:02] by keeping silence is consenting
[1:09:06] to her vow that's why
[1:09:09] you don't have to keep silence when you
[1:09:12] have to talk
[1:09:15] amen then all her vows shall stand
[1:09:19] and every bond wherewith she shall bound
[1:09:22] her soul shall stand
[1:09:24] but if her daddy do what
[1:09:27] so daddy have a power to break
[1:09:31] or to approve a vow daddy is either a
[1:09:35] man or a woman
[1:09:37] that is still a water
[1:09:46] but if her father disallow her in the
[1:09:49] day that he hears
[1:09:51] not any of her vow or her bones
[1:09:54] wherewith she has bound her soul
[1:09:56] shall stand and the lord shall do what
[1:10:00] the forgiveness of her is coming through
[1:10:03] daddy
[1:10:07] you follow me see how we've been playing
[1:10:11] in the message
[1:10:13] see how we play the message amen
[1:10:17] because her father disallowed her
[1:10:20] when daddy break it even god forgive her
[1:10:26] but when a mature man speak
[1:10:29] no forgiveness you see how dangerous it
[1:10:33] is buddy you see now but benjamin
[1:10:36] you hooked amen
[1:10:40] and if she has verse six
[1:10:43] if she had at all a word
[1:10:49] first father number two who
[1:10:53] his husband a man or a woman
[1:10:57] why men men men and women still
[1:11:01] under either your head she please under
[1:11:06] daddy
[1:11:07] all your headship is under
[1:11:12] if her husband when she vowed
[1:11:15] or order anything out of her lips where
[1:11:18] if she burned her soul
[1:11:20] and her husband heard it this is hard
[1:11:23] in nowadays spirit upon women
[1:11:26] and he heard his piece of hair in the
[1:11:29] day that he heard it
[1:11:30] then her vow shall stand and her bond
[1:11:34] wherewith she bound her soul shall stand
[1:11:37] but if her husband do what in other
[1:11:40] words the husband has the power to break
[1:11:43] a vow or to approve it
[1:11:50] this is not african this is the bible
[1:11:58] hallelujah and that which she added
[1:12:02] with her lips wherewith she burned her
[1:12:06] soul verse 8
[1:12:07] of non-effect and the lord shall do what
[1:12:11] the forgiveness again is into the
[1:12:14] husband
[1:12:15] let me put it here forgive him
[1:12:20] a woman what if she's not married
[1:12:23] brother stephen and all the but the
[1:12:24] husband died or something what is she
[1:12:26] going to do
[1:12:28] you want to know verse 9
[1:12:31] but every vowel of a water
[1:12:38] i can sit with you eight hours like this
[1:12:41] every vowel for water and we know is a
[1:12:45] woman that is married
[1:12:47] she has been married but she lost to her
[1:12:50] she lost the head
[1:12:55] she was married she left her parent
[1:12:59] daddy was no longer her head
[1:13:02] she went under the new head which is the
[1:13:05] husband
[1:13:06] now the husband is not the head
[1:13:10] you follow me but remember
[1:13:13] man the head of men is who
[1:13:18] and the head of the woman is who so when
[1:13:21] you destroy
[1:13:22] man by death what is the head that is
[1:13:26] staying
[1:13:28] the head of a man is who if a man
[1:13:32] vowed do we change his vow if the woman
[1:13:35] lost a man her head is becoming who
[1:13:40] so if she vow is she gonna be flip again
[1:13:44] let's see what the scriptures say
[1:13:48] but every vowel lord have mercy on me
[1:13:53] just this is taking time but every vowel
[1:13:56] of the water oh hey that is what
[1:14:00] divorce is separated from what
[1:14:06] widow and divorce means door-head
[1:14:11] no head what is this amen
[1:14:15] wherewith they have burned their soul
[1:14:18] shall do water
[1:14:21] there is no redemption
[1:14:24] because now she's vowing under who
[1:14:28] man was vowing under who when a woman
[1:14:31] vows she either far away
[1:14:34] here or there forgiveness when she go
[1:14:37] under this like a man locked
[1:14:42] what are you trying to preach today
[1:14:44] verse 13
[1:14:46] every vowel and every bounding off
[1:14:49] to afflict the soul her husband
[1:14:52] may do what establish
[1:14:56] it or her husband may do what
[1:14:59] the man have a power to break it or to
[1:15:01] establish it
[1:15:03] let's go to isaiah 4 then we can pray
[1:15:08] just this you understand now the
[1:15:10] scripture clearly
[1:15:12] and you see what a deadly thing it is to

[1:23:57] to
[1:23:58] say just that it's not good for a woman
[1:24:00] to cut the hair
[1:24:01] but there was more to it when we begin
[1:24:04] to enter that you begin to realize
[1:24:06] that the hair of a woman is not just
[1:24:08] taking a scissor
[1:24:09] and picking up it is actually the action
[1:24:12] of taking a scissor and cutting your
[1:24:14] hair is
[1:24:16] is showing a spirit and that spirit goes
[1:24:19] more than just cutting the hair it's a
[1:24:22] rebellion
[1:24:23] spirit of jezebel anybody clear so far
[1:24:27] amen now when we begin to talk about the
[1:24:30] hair
[1:24:31] in ii king chapter 9 verse 30
[1:24:34] the bible says that when jesus come to
[1:24:37] jezreel
[1:24:38] jezebel heard of it now you know what it
[1:24:40] means
[1:24:41] and she painted her face three things
[1:24:44] she tied her hair
[1:24:45] and she looked out to the window we are
[1:24:48] still dealing with the towering of the
[1:24:51] head and brother branham said that
[1:24:53] jezebel
[1:24:54] turing her head right there
[1:24:57] means what she was cutting her hair
[1:25:01] and roll it up so tying her head
[1:25:04] which is a disgrace why is brother brad
[1:25:08] i'm saying it's a disgrace
[1:25:10] a woman that cuts her hair dishonor her
[1:25:13] welcome
[1:25:14] husband if you under your father you
[1:25:17] dishonoring who
[1:25:19] the bible said so a dishonorable woman
[1:25:23] should be divorced or put away
[1:25:26] that is a son that she does what
[1:25:30] she loves somebody else according to the
[1:25:33] bible
[1:25:34] because she dishonor her husband
[1:25:37] when she does it if there is any man on
[1:25:41] planet earth sister
[1:25:43] that you need to honor and to respect is
[1:25:46] your husband
[1:25:47] a normal woman should never
[1:25:50] be at peace when somebody play with her
[1:25:54] husband
[1:25:55] a normal woman amen and a normal man
[1:25:59] should never be in peace when somebody
[1:26:02] is praying or joking or making fun of
[1:26:05] his wife amen
[1:26:07] so when you begin to dishonor your
[1:26:09] husband
[1:26:10] it shows automatically that you are
[1:26:13] looking at somebody else
[1:26:15] even though you are innocent and you
[1:26:17] don't know what you're doing
[1:26:19] everybody clear so far but that is the
[1:26:21] way god interpreted
[1:26:23] and that is wrong everybody clear now
[1:26:26] when we touch up on wednesday
[1:26:28] we spoke about the nazarite with the
[1:26:31] woman
[1:26:32] the first example that we took for
[1:26:34] nazareth
[1:26:35] was the example of samsung and
[1:26:38] the samsung is not a woman samsung is a
[1:26:42] man
[1:26:43] and we explained to you on wednesday
[1:26:44] that every characteristic
[1:26:46] that was given under number six was
[1:26:50] talking about
[1:26:51] a man because a woman by nature
[1:26:54] automatically have long hair it is the
[1:26:57] man that is not supposed to have long in
[1:27:00] the hair
[1:27:00] and once a man begin to wear long hair
[1:27:04] it is something that look awkward
[1:27:07] it is something that looks bizarre it is
[1:27:10] something that is peculiar
[1:27:12] it is something that is odd and that was
[1:27:16] put in the scripture
[1:27:17] as a son of a nazarite
[1:27:20] ever clear the sound of the nazareth man
[1:27:24] was put on their hair everybody cleared
[1:27:26] so far
[1:27:28] that sun was assembled
[1:27:31] of a consecration i want you to listen
[1:27:33] carefully
[1:27:35] he was a symbol of separation
[1:27:38] for a purpose in other words when
[1:27:40] someone was in nazareth
[1:27:43] and nazareth was somebody that was
[1:27:45] consecrated
[1:27:47] he was somebody that was separated for a
[1:27:50] specific purpose
[1:27:52] anybody clear so far georges chapter 13
[1:27:56] verse 7
[1:27:57] but he said unto me this is the mother
[1:28:00] of samson
[1:28:01] behold dasha conceive and bear
[1:28:04] a water not a woman and now
[1:28:08] and now drink no wine no
[1:28:11] strong drink neither eat any unclean
[1:28:14] thing
[1:28:15] for the child shall be a water
[1:28:18] a nazarite unto who the head of a man is
[1:28:22] who
[1:28:23] a nazi right unto god from the womb
[1:28:27] to the day of his water in other words
[1:28:30] the hair
[1:28:31] of samson have to remain
[1:28:34] long do you follow me from the womb
[1:28:40] do you follow me on the day of his death
[1:28:44] you follow me in other words the hair
[1:28:47] of samson must be consecrated
[1:28:51] his entire life on earth throughout your
[1:28:55] entire journey
[1:28:56] on the earth you must be another right
[1:29:00] unto the lord the bible never say
[1:29:04] that for something to be an azerite up
[1:29:06] to a certain spot
[1:29:07] all the way up which is the top of a
[1:29:11] woman
[1:29:12] showing that when a woman is born do you
[1:29:14] follow me
[1:29:15] she is automatically under consecration
[1:29:19] from her breath all the way to the death
[1:29:22] all the way to the rapture everybody
[1:29:25] following me
[1:29:27] paul in first corinth in galatians 1
[1:29:29] verse 15 say
[1:29:31] but when he please god not men
[1:29:34] who did what separated me well
[1:29:39] from my mother's womb why from the womb
[1:29:42] of the mother
[1:29:43] it is a sign of predestination
[1:29:47] from my mother's womb and called me
[1:29:51] by his water that separation
[1:29:54] started before you were born god already
[1:29:58] elected you for something so when god
[1:30:01] sent you as a woman you know on a planet
[1:30:05] earth
[1:30:06] it is a signal that god already
[1:30:09] consecrated you for something
[1:30:11] as a woman if god sent you as a man it's
[1:30:15] a different story
[1:30:18] about here first corinthians chapter 11
[1:30:21] verse 14 and 15 do not
[1:30:24] even water nature itself teach you
[1:30:29] and god is reflected in nature
[1:30:32] that is a water have long hair
[1:30:35] it is a water that's why samson look
[1:30:39] awkward you follow me
[1:30:42] but if a woman have water
[1:30:46] it is the water it is a glory to her
[1:30:50] for her hair is giving her for her water
[1:30:54] god give a woman help for covering
[1:30:57] why the hair was not giving
[1:31:01] for a covering for a man only for a
[1:31:04] woman
[1:31:07] why why not
[1:31:11] hallelujah number six
[1:31:15] he shall not make himself unclean for
[1:31:18] his father
[1:31:19] or for his mother for his brother or for
[1:31:22] his sister
[1:31:23] when they die nazara because the
[1:31:25] consecration of his god is upon his
[1:31:28] water
[1:31:29] and the nazareth shall shave the head of
[1:31:32] his separation
[1:31:33] this is a man but not samson
[1:31:37] at the door of the tabernacle of the
[1:31:39] congregation
[1:31:41] he shall take the hell of his head
[1:31:44] of his separation and put it in the fire
[1:31:47] which is under the sacrifice of a peace
[1:31:50] offering you made peace with god
[1:31:52] brother branham said now we found out in
[1:31:55] number
[1:31:56] the sixth chapter we explained this on
[1:31:58] wednesday that a nazarite called
[1:32:01] a nazaratco was to separate themselves
[1:32:04] from all the water
[1:32:07] the word to the word of god that is
[1:32:10] an azerite called separated we found out
[1:32:14] that samson was a nazarite unto the lord
[1:32:17] and he was separated from the he didn't
[1:32:20] finish
[1:32:21] by a what a sun that sound was way

[1:32:46] everybody clear seven lops he was
[1:32:49] a son of separation that he was called
[1:32:53] for a water
[1:32:55] wisdom built herself a house
[1:33:00] you follow me and that house has how
[1:33:03] many penis
[1:33:06] seven pillars everybody clear and the
[1:33:08] prostitute in revelation 17
[1:33:11] she sit upon seven water
[1:33:14] seven mountains ever clear now samsung

[1:33:32] was not
[1:33:33] on your torso the sound of the nazarite
[1:33:37] was not
[1:33:38] on your chest the sound of an azerite
[1:33:41] was not on the belly
[1:33:43] the sun of the nazareth was on the hell
[1:33:47] but the hair of samson which was the top
[1:33:51] of the church
[1:33:53] had seven locks so brother branham say
[1:33:57] where did you get seven locks brother
[1:33:59] branham
[1:34:00] you ready brother branham
[1:34:04] in charges 16 verse 13
[1:34:07] and delilah say unto simpson hitler too
[1:34:12] that has mocked me and told me what
[1:34:15] the brother was already lying tell me
[1:34:18] where with
[1:34:18] that mother that mother's be bound and
[1:34:22] he said unto her
[1:34:23] if that we vest the water
[1:34:26] the seven locks off my water with the
[1:34:30] water
[1:34:31] so the hair of samson have how many
[1:34:34] locks
[1:34:35] are you following me do you follow me
[1:34:38] and the hair

[1:34:44] you follow me and samsung was
[1:34:48] a judge
[1:34:51] do you get that do you get that
[1:34:55] let me start it again the word
[1:34:58] samson means son
[1:35:02] s-u-n you follow me
[1:35:05] you follow me clear and god took
[1:35:08] a man by the name of samson
[1:35:11] and took another vow and put upon
[1:35:15] the head of samson
[1:35:18] and the nazarite vow have seven
[1:35:21] rocks just like wisdom heads
[1:35:25] has how many pillars seven pillars do
[1:35:29] you follow me
[1:35:30] and that look was put under one of the
[1:35:34] judges
[1:35:35] of israel ever clear
[1:35:38] because samsung is in the book of the
[1:35:41] judges
[1:35:42] and samsung is one of the judges
[1:35:45] and the judges must have a hair
[1:35:48] that have seven different looks
[1:35:53] and we know that in sabino canyon
[1:35:57] do you follow me there was a hell that
[1:36:00] came down
[1:36:02] are you there and the head wave also
[1:36:05] seven rocks upon the head of who
[1:36:10] it is the rising of the
[1:36:13] the son have been risen
[1:36:16] with seven locks in his head showing
[1:36:19] that this time
[1:36:21] of the nazarite is back again on the
[1:36:24] world
[1:36:27] are you following me are you following
[1:36:29] me
[1:36:30] your cloud was in the bible all along
[1:36:34] it was seven angels and the seven
[1:36:37] angels made the cloud they made the wig
[1:36:41] of christ
[1:36:42] which is a top of the judge because the
[1:36:45] supreme judge
[1:36:47] because samson was a judge
[1:36:51] this message came from heaven this
[1:36:54] message is the truth
[1:36:56] this message is jesus christ this
[1:37:00] message
[1:37:00] is the word of god for this end time
[1:37:05] hallelujah who put that in the bible
[1:37:11] who put that in the bible the seventh
[1:37:13] chamberlain of the king
[1:37:15] the seven pillars of the wisdom who put
[1:37:18] all of that in the bible
[1:37:20] because seven locks was on the head
[1:37:24] seven locks on the head of christ which
[1:37:27] was showing you
[1:37:28] that the seventh tap the seven locks the
[1:37:31] seven angels
[1:37:32] are now come and the supreme judge is
[1:37:35] coming
[1:37:36] to destroy everybody here so far
[1:37:41] everybody here so far everybody clears
[1:37:43] so far
[1:37:44] brother branham said he was dissembled
[1:37:48] of authority and the symbol
[1:37:51] of power ever clear so far
[1:37:55] but there was a woman
[1:38:00] by the name of dilala
[1:38:03] all de la la was working
[1:38:07] was to find the power of samson
[1:38:13] the power of samsung laid
[1:38:17] in the nazareth volume that was
[1:38:20] connected to the seven locks
[1:38:26] and those locks must remain from his
[1:38:29] birth all the way to his death
[1:38:33] if you shave the locks
[1:38:38] if you remove the cloud
[1:38:48] do you see why your crazy website
[1:38:52] has been attacking the crowd it is the
[1:38:55] spirit of
[1:38:56] jezebel it is a spirit of delilah
[1:39:00] because they understood that the cloud
[1:39:02] that came on sunset mountain
[1:39:04] brought power to the bride so if they
[1:39:08] can remove
[1:39:09] the crowd
[1:39:12] if they can disprove the crowd
[1:39:15] that's why brother branham said the
[1:39:18] cloud of sunset mountain
[1:39:20] is proof that the message is the truth
[1:39:25] and they
[1:39:26] understood that if they can save the
[1:39:29] crowd
[1:39:30] away from the church
[1:39:37] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:39:41] de la la all that she wanted
[1:39:45] was to get the crowd out of the church
[1:39:48] and once the crowd is taken off the
[1:39:52] church
[1:39:55] that church is done once the
[1:39:58] seven lots are removed from simpson
[1:40:04] that's it they're gonna revive your old
[1:40:07] life
[1:40:08] you're going back to the high heel
[1:40:10] you're going back to the lips
[1:40:12] you're going back to the long nails
[1:40:14] you're going back to wearing pants
[1:40:17] those people are not doing that by any
[1:40:20] chance
[1:40:21] once you remove the cloud automatically
[1:40:24] that's the anointing that enters the
[1:40:25] church
[1:40:29] thank god for heaven spare you
[1:40:32] [Applause]
[1:40:34] thank god for having sparrows
[1:40:39] because some of you could be underpants
[1:40:41] already at this time
[1:40:44] but god elected you before the
[1:40:47] foundation of the world
[1:40:49] he will be very close that he will
[1:40:51] deceive the very elect
[1:40:53] if he was possible but the elect
[1:40:56] will never be deceived
[1:40:59] hallelujah that's why you stand here
[1:41:03] you stand by the grace of the supreme
[1:41:06] judge
[1:41:07] who loves you who care for you who
[1:41:09] protected you
[1:41:10] who watch over your predestination
[1:41:13] that's not my anointing
[1:41:19] hallelujah blessed be the name of the
[1:41:22] lord
[1:41:24] we found on wednesday
[1:41:27] samson a woman looking for your power
[1:41:30] to destroy you try first time try
[1:41:34] second time try third time and samsung
[1:41:36] still can get it
[1:41:38] what was in dirala that was holding
[1:41:41] samson
[1:41:43] everybody clear so far what was in dela
[1:41:46] that was holding samsung we know that
[1:41:48] paul
[1:41:50] and peter both of them spoke to us
[1:41:53] about two women the immoral woman
[1:41:57] ever clear and the good woman
[1:42:01] ever clear and the immoral woman
[1:42:04] brother brother says that she control
[1:42:06] the man by how many things
[1:42:09] the first thing is water her beauty
[1:42:12] which is the face the second thing is
[1:42:15] water
[1:42:17] by sex control the third thing is waters
[1:42:22] head shape which is formal
[1:42:27] and the two one i told you and i'm gonna
[1:42:30] prove to you this
[1:42:31] by brother branham that it's on the
[1:42:34] torso
[1:42:35] the chest are you there
[1:42:38] and it's also on the waist
[1:42:41] when you dress sister watch carefully
[1:42:45] what you do to your chest and what you
[1:42:48] do to your waist
[1:42:50] amen brother branham pointed these two
[1:42:54] and they tried to push for the belly but
[1:42:57] it didn't work
[1:42:59] because they tried to make a a pregnant
[1:43:02] woman sexy
[1:43:03] you remember you seen that all over but
[1:43:06] it still could not work because that was
[1:43:08] motherhood
[1:43:09] there's no way you can make a pregnant
[1:43:11] woman with a big belly sexy
[1:43:12] it didn't work because the prophet must
[1:43:15] stay true
[1:43:18] are you with me hallelujah now what a
[1:43:22] difference in this day
[1:43:24] in this day of conception instead of him
[1:43:27] being her what
[1:43:31] instead of man being the ruler either
[1:43:34] by being a husband or by being a father
[1:43:38] let's go slowly she has become his water
[1:43:42] sure she rules him contrary
[1:43:47] now you can probably well understand
[1:43:49] what i have been
[1:43:50] hitting it the message by her what
[1:43:54] by her water by her water
[1:43:58] now she was given by who this beauty
[1:44:01] is not the beauty god gives you
[1:44:05] it is a beauty given by satan
[1:44:10] which jezebel bring by the painting of
[1:44:13] the face
[1:44:14] the painting of the the eye all the
[1:44:16] stuff that we talk about
[1:44:18] which is artificial beauty ever clear
[1:44:21] and this sex control is not
[1:44:24] the normal way a man and a woman live in
[1:44:28] a marriage
[1:44:28] because we showed you that there are
[1:44:30] four categories of
[1:44:32] lust of love there is a feeling
[1:44:35] and a gap in love a feeling of love then
[1:44:38] a lustful love
[1:44:39] then a fearful of those two loves that's
[1:44:42] the one these women operate by
[1:44:44] are you there and the form of the shape
[1:44:47] i'm going to show you
[1:44:49] what he does by the high heel but it was
[1:44:51] given
[1:44:52] to deceive the sons of god but
[1:44:55] delilah did you notice she knowed
[1:44:58] that samson had the power and she didn't
[1:45:02] know
[1:45:02] where that power laid she could not tell
[1:45:05] what the power was but she was some
[1:45:08] great
[1:45:09] power that samson but there was
[1:45:12] some great power that samson possessed
[1:45:15] and she wanted to fund it and as
[1:45:18] delilah she kept doing water
[1:45:23] seducing samson after her water
[1:45:27] why is even the message consistent
[1:45:32] after her beauty oh she
[1:45:36] dresses herself in real water
[1:45:39] sex control when they tell you you look
[1:45:42] sexy it's not a compliment just know
[1:45:46] you're already out of the line
[1:45:48] are you there because you should not
[1:45:51] dress yourself to provoke a man
[1:45:55] we we're gonna show you on your dressing
[1:45:57] it's coming are you there
[1:46:00] and she walked before him and she t-heed
[1:46:05] like some of this leader teenagers
[1:46:08] of the day it was not a
[1:46:11] normal work a woman walk but she worked
[1:46:15] a certain way
[1:46:16] to bring attention
[1:46:21] have you seen what what do you call
[1:46:23] those stuff that women have
[1:46:25] women walk in front of men until they
[1:46:28] have to choose the
[1:46:30] the top one what do you call it models
[1:46:33] and do you see how those women work they
[1:46:36] walk a certain way
[1:46:37] and all the young people want to walk
[1:46:39] like that and when they walk they
[1:46:41] usually walk with water how many dresses
[1:46:43] do they have
[1:46:44] like with a bathing suit and men are
[1:46:47] sitting there
[1:46:48] taking pictures and all the young
[1:46:50] sisters will want to walk like that
[1:46:52] you don't understand that walk is made
[1:46:55] for a certain thing
[1:46:56] and if you watch the walk is already
[1:46:59] coupled with high heel
[1:47:02] why did they put high heels to work like
[1:47:04] that
[1:47:05] you're going to see it
[1:47:08] amen and i want and want to just act
[1:47:12] like something another
[1:47:13] i stripped is tying to who samson to her
[1:47:18] what was in that simpson a woman chaser
[1:47:22] sure a brother became became a woman
[1:47:25] chaser
[1:47:26] he was arrogant
[1:47:29] disobedient to his father and mother
[1:47:31] they told him not to go there
[1:47:33] they told him not to go down there with
[1:47:36] that woman
[1:47:36] come on that what so brother branham is
[1:47:40] identifying
[1:47:41] the spirit upon dilla as the same spirit
[1:47:45] that was upon who
[1:47:47] you understand now jezebel but he would
[1:47:50] not listen to them
[1:47:52] what was it samson had strength now
[1:47:55] listen
[1:47:56] samson was willing to submit his
[1:47:58] strength
[1:47:59] samson gave his strength to god but he
[1:48:02] gave his heart to her
[1:48:04] to a jezebel and malachi 4 comes to take
[1:48:08] the heart of the children back to work
[1:48:10] so i finally dela ended up
[1:48:14] understanding that if i can save the
[1:48:17] crowd
[1:48:21] because there is a message that has been
[1:48:25] brought
[1:48:25] there is a wisdom on the end time that
[1:48:28] god sent
[1:48:29] to protect his children against
[1:48:32] harlot hollowed spiritually and a lot
[1:48:36] naturally
[1:48:37] if i can remove the message of the hour
[1:48:41] if i can remove the crowd if i can
[1:48:45] remove that picture
[1:48:47] off of them then i'm gonna take them
[1:48:51] to prisoner when the hair
[1:48:54] was cut down do they stop there
[1:48:58] do you know what they did to samsung
[1:49:01] they punch his eyes
[1:49:03] go call your so-called brother
[1:49:07] call your old sister give them
[1:49:10] scripture after scripture if they're
[1:49:13] going to listen to you
[1:49:15] their eyes has been what
[1:49:19] are you there you can give them 10
[1:49:21] scriptures
[1:49:22] they won't listen to you anymore because
[1:49:24] they never
[1:49:25] understood what's the delilah remove the
[1:49:28] message
[1:49:29] that spirit doesn't stop there it will
[1:49:31] punch your eyes out
[1:49:33] so you will not see the truth anymore
[1:49:36] and once they punch your eyes out
[1:49:38] they don't stop there they're gonna take
[1:49:40] you and put you in prison
[1:49:42] you become souls in water
[1:49:49] are you there did they stop there
[1:49:52] then samsung became an entertainment
[1:49:56] for the devil
[1:49:58] [Music]
[1:50:04] when you break the message when you
[1:50:07] break the atonement of this end time
[1:50:09] when you break the cloud
[1:50:12] when you remove it from a church the
[1:50:15] next step is a chaos
[1:50:17] you're going to be blinded spiritually
[1:50:19] you're going to go
[1:50:20] back into souls in prison that's why
[1:50:23] you're going to go back to worthiness
[1:50:25] begin to wear pants begin to cut your
[1:50:27] hair begin to put the makeup
[1:50:29] because you're already reflecting hell
[1:50:32] just like the women were reflecting hair
[1:50:34] on jessie penny and later on
[1:50:37] you become an entertainment for the
[1:50:39] devil
[1:50:41] when they want to laugh they call you
[1:50:43] they say come here
[1:50:44] this used to be message believer look at

[1:51:06] a reproach for us at work

[1:51:14] sister will say this is not good
[1:51:16] look at her she start wearing pants come
[1:51:18] on here tell us
[1:51:20] now you're not a skirt girl anymore now

[1:51:24] now you look sexy look how you looking
[1:51:26] you become
[1:51:30] entertainment for the devil are you
[1:51:32] there
[1:51:33] a hair to a woman is a nazirite vowel
[1:51:38] hair to samson was a nazareth vow
[1:51:41] and when a woman cut off her hair she
[1:51:44] absolutely denied her water
[1:51:48] that she is a bride too
[1:51:52] hallelujah we're still okay
[1:51:55] because there that one thing
[1:51:59] she spoke the whole picture correctly
[1:52:02] a nazarite is one that is consecrated
[1:52:05] for a purpose
[1:52:06] is that right samsung was consecrated to
[1:52:09] a age
[1:52:10] and to a purpose therefore he had
[1:52:14] long hair the woman that is a child of
[1:52:18] god
[1:52:19] let her hair will do what
[1:52:23] to show that she is what
[1:52:26] to what remember the condition
[1:52:30] of the church is always reflected
[1:52:34] through the life of a woman
[1:52:38] if she cuts it off i don't care how much
[1:52:42] she does
[1:52:43] sing in a choir speaking tongue
[1:52:46] runs up and down or has all kinds of
[1:52:49] heads
[1:52:50] she is working
[1:52:53] sing is in the choir first that is
[1:52:57] the self the lord the word of god first
[1:52:59] corinthians 14
[1:53:01] she has denied her nazi right vow and
[1:53:04] sold out to the god of this water
[1:53:08] you remove the cloud
[1:53:13] always cut the hair do you follow me
[1:53:18] when we were together all the men were
[1:53:21] cutting their hair
[1:53:22] the women were keeping the hair
[1:53:26] you follow me when the cloud was removed
[1:53:29] from the church
[1:53:32] are you following me certain women came
[1:53:35] out
[1:53:36] and they kept her hair but because
[1:53:39] the cloud was removed from the church
[1:53:43] the women that stay under that church
[1:53:47] what are they gonna do to the hair the
[1:53:50] cutting of the hair is a natural sign
[1:53:54] because the cloud spiritually was
[1:53:57] removed from the church
[1:54:03] our pentecostal women like that that's
[1:54:06] too bad
[1:54:08] that's too bad shame sister there is a
[1:54:11] letdown somewhere
[1:54:12] i hope it's not in a puppy yes it's in a
[1:54:15] pulpit
[1:54:16] remember what a woman is to be she's
[1:54:19] very sweet
[1:54:20] i was talking to someone today when
[1:54:22] rebecca came to meet
[1:54:23] her did you notice she fell her face
[1:54:26] they still do it
[1:54:27] they don't know what they're doing but
[1:54:29] the bride failed her face
[1:54:31] and they failed the cover and given to a
[1:54:33] woman his hair water
[1:54:35] thank you why the man is the head
[1:54:40] the nature of a woman is to yield to a
[1:54:44] man
[1:54:48] that is the reason the church should be
[1:54:50] there
[1:54:51] it's got a head that is water remember
[1:54:54] he goes spiritually and he dropped
[1:54:56] naturally
[1:54:58] the woman is supposed to wear long nail
[1:55:01] because of her who
[1:55:04] which is her he is to
[1:55:08] shave he is
[1:55:11] to have short hair because of who
[1:55:15] brother branham is saying because woman
[1:55:18] was john pull from a man
[1:55:23] woman must have a covering
[1:55:27] we're gonna go in the scripture you okay
[1:55:31] but man was not pulled from somebody
[1:55:35] man was actually made in the
[1:55:38] image and likeness of god
[1:55:42] in other words man automatically comes
[1:55:45] on the earth as a head
[1:55:47] reflecting the head god
[1:55:50] because head is reflecting head
[1:55:54] he must cut his hair
[1:55:59] relax i'm gonna get to that surgery
[1:56:03] okay just relax i don't want anybody
[1:56:05] bleeding
[1:56:06] you there because of christ
[1:56:09] the woman wear long hair because of what
[1:56:15] one is the angels the water
[1:56:20] is everybody awake a true messenger to
[1:56:24] the water
[1:56:26] let's stop here let's go back again
[1:56:29] the woman wearing long hair because of
[1:56:32] who
[1:56:33] according to brother branham brother
[1:56:37] branham said the reason why
[1:56:39] a woman is wearing long hair not
[1:56:42] only is she coming
[1:56:45] from men that's why she was called
[1:56:50] woman anybody clear
[1:56:54] but the second reason brother branham
[1:56:56] said because of
[1:56:58] angels and brother branham is defining
[1:57:01] angela's who
[1:57:05] we already put the foundation on
[1:57:06] wednesday now i want you to stay
[1:57:09] tight so we can navigate through this
[1:57:12] because of the engine
[1:57:13] and that gen ninja is a messenger
[1:57:16] on wednesday we showed you
[1:57:20] four stages anybody clear
[1:57:24] number one the head of everything
[1:57:28] is god you remember that on wednesday
[1:57:31] everybody remember that
[1:57:34] the head of every man is christ
[1:57:38] and the head of christ is god and god
[1:57:41] and christ are water
[1:57:42] and christ is the chief shepherd
[1:57:46] which is the top pastor a shepherd is a
[1:57:48] pastor
[1:57:49] everybody clear then when you drop down
[1:57:53] just like you're dropping down from
[1:57:55] divine love and you're going down to
[1:57:57] feel you
[1:57:58] when you drop down then after christ
[1:58:01] which is the chief pastor of the entire
[1:58:04] church
[1:58:05] the entire bread from genesis
[1:58:09] from ephesus all the way to laodicea
[1:58:12] that's why the head comes with the seven
[1:58:15] locks
[1:58:16] are you there showing that i'm missing
[1:58:19] my body
[1:58:21] are you there that cloud only have the
[1:58:24] hair
[1:58:25] but not the body because the body is on
[1:58:28] the earth
[1:58:29] the head is coming to connect with the
[1:58:32] body
[1:58:33] and then take the body with him so when
[1:58:35] you cut
[1:58:36] the hell off the church that body loses
[1:58:39] gps
[1:58:43] because the gps is the head the supreme
[1:58:46] intelligence
[1:58:49] are you there so now when you go to the
[1:58:52] church ages because there are seven
[1:58:54] locks
[1:58:54] seven church ages are you there every
[1:58:58] church age has a messenger
[1:59:00] and that messenger is also a pastor
[1:59:03] not to the bride but a pastor to his
[1:59:07] edge because it's a church age
[1:59:10] the church entirely is the blood of
[1:59:13] jesus christ
[1:59:14] the head is crushed but under the bread
[1:59:18] it is divided through seven locks
[1:59:22] you understand then the seven locks
[1:59:25] every locks is a church edge
[1:59:27] and that church have a pastor which is
[1:59:30] the
[1:59:30] messenger that's why the bible says
[1:59:33] right unto them
[1:59:38] unto the water unto the water
[1:59:43] right unto the word not to you the
[1:59:46] letter was to thee
[1:59:48] because he is the pastor
[1:59:52] everybody follow me state that
[1:59:55] then from there comes the word the local
[1:59:58] pastor
[1:59:59] anybody following me the local pastor
[2:00:02] must be under the messenger and that
[2:00:06] messenger must be under
[2:00:08] christ that's why paul said follow
[2:00:11] as a follower so we the christ
[2:00:15] paul the messenger then timothy
[2:00:18] then the believer all in line but our
[2:00:22] paul is brother pronoun
[2:00:28] are you there when you leave the local
[2:00:31] church
[2:00:32] then you go into your own family
[2:00:36] if you are married the head is your
[2:00:38] husband
[2:00:40] you understand the vow and if you are
[2:00:43] not married
[2:00:44] the head is your or
[2:00:47] your legal guardian
[2:00:50] amen some people father died mother died
[2:00:57] relax i don't want to say chill out
[2:01:00] anymore
[2:01:01] are you there there's three here
[2:01:05] this is a spiritual it's christ
[2:01:08] this is a natural man he's a human
[2:01:12] this pastor is a natural man just like
[2:01:15] me
[2:01:16] your husband is natural your father is
[2:01:18] natural
[2:01:19] ever here these three
[2:01:23] are called angels if you
[2:01:26] notice jesus christ is a man
[2:01:34] messenger a man
[2:01:37] pastor a man
[2:01:42] husband a man
[2:01:45] father a man that's why a woman
[2:01:48] should never be a pastor
[2:01:54] a woman should never be a husband to
[2:01:57] another woman
[2:02:04] everybody follow me for
[2:02:07] this for the man is
[2:02:10] not of the word
[2:02:13] you want to see that in the bible it's
[2:02:15] in the bible
[2:02:18] okay let me save time for the man
[2:02:22] is not of the word in other words
[2:02:25] man did not come from the woman
[2:02:28] remember genesis it was the woman that
[2:02:31] came from man
[2:02:32] this is paul speaking in corinthians
[2:02:34] when you go home go to first corinthian
[2:02:36] 11 you're going to see this
[2:02:38] for man is not of the woman
[2:02:41] but the woman is off what paul is
[2:02:44] perfectly lining up
[2:02:46] with genesis okay
[2:02:49] for this cause because brother bradham
[2:02:53] says
[2:02:53] because the woman was pulled from the
[2:02:56] men that's why she were recovering
[2:02:58] where did brother branham get to that
[2:03:02] where did brother brother get that
[2:03:04] brother branham is saying that oh no
[2:03:06] those are just message people the
[2:03:08] message believer why are you
[2:03:09] why do you wear long hair i wear long
[2:03:12] hair because message believer
[2:03:14] long uh away long hair i don't want
[2:03:17] those kind of answers in this church
[2:03:20] i don't want it in this church not in
[2:03:22] this church
[2:03:24] do you follow me when they ask you why
[2:03:26] do you wear long hair
[2:03:28] you say sit down take your bible
[2:03:32] the bible says the bible says the bible
[2:03:35] says
[2:03:35] that's why the prophet that god sent us
[2:03:38] in this
[2:03:38] age taught us that is not good for a
[2:03:41] woman to cut her hair
[2:03:42] he gathered from there no more
[2:03:46] because if you keep that conception
[2:03:48] that's why when they sway
[2:03:50] the message away from you cut your hair
[2:03:52] you cut your hair because you were never
[2:03:54] thought
[2:03:55] that that keeping your hair long it's
[2:03:57] not because just you grown up in the
[2:03:59] message
[2:04:00] but it's the word of god and the message
[2:04:03] is the word of god because it line up
[2:04:05] perfectly with the scripture
[2:04:08] okay now for this cause other woman
[2:04:11] which caused
[2:04:13] because woman was pulled from water for
[2:04:16] this cause
[2:04:17] ought to man a woman to have water
[2:04:22] power on her water that power
[2:04:26] doesn't means like a power coming up
[2:04:28] like this
[2:04:29] the word power means a sign
[2:04:33] on her what that's why brother branham
[2:04:36] say a woman is under the nasa right
[2:04:39] because the son of a nazarite was where
[2:04:42] you understand now power
[2:04:46] means it's a sign
[2:04:50] of authority because it's power
[2:04:54] it's a sign that she is under
[2:04:58] authority are you there
[2:05:01] that's why brother branham said when a
[2:05:03] woman cut her hair
[2:05:04] she's dishonoring her authority
[2:05:09] paul is saying because woman was pulled
[2:05:12] from a man
[2:05:13] she must wear a covering as a son
[2:05:17] that she is under power
[2:05:20] you follow me now do you follow me under
[2:05:23] power that power could be her husband
[2:05:26] oh daddy or a legal guardian
[2:05:30] i'm gonna show you that in the scripture
[2:05:35] for this cause ought a woman to have
[2:05:38] power son of authority on her water
[2:05:42] the sun in the head was an azerite sun
[2:05:45] okay
[2:05:46] because of the word if you watch the
[2:05:49] angels
[2:05:49] is plural not one
[2:05:53] and if you watch that angel have a
[2:05:55] little a
[2:05:57] not the angel of the lord you understand
[2:06:00] if they're many angels who are they
[2:06:05] the big one is christ the second one is
[2:06:08] what
[2:06:09] the third one is what your your
[2:06:12] fifth one is what and the other one
[2:06:19] corona vaccine any of you reading it
[2:06:24] first corinthians the 11th chapter and
[2:06:26] the 10th verse you can see the home
[2:06:28] if you notice power why
[2:06:32] of the angel of the angels first
[2:06:35] corinthians
[2:06:36] because the engine is the water
[2:06:40] i'm going slowly young sister get this
[2:06:43] pretty good
[2:06:45] because the angel is the man the water
[2:06:50] look it's a luna a again
[2:06:53] where angel with big a are concerned of
[2:06:57] heavenly it's a big a
[2:07:00] capital a where it's a leader a
[2:07:03] it is what in other words when it's
[2:07:06] capital a it's supernatural being
[2:07:10] you follow me when it's leader a it
[2:07:12] means
[2:07:13] human beings everybody following me
[2:07:17] that was the messenger the letter to the
[2:07:21] seven church ages written
[2:07:23] prophetically to the future paul wrote
[2:07:26] of the life and the glory of the seven
[2:07:28] church ages
[2:07:29] present in his day we are good with time
[2:07:34] john wrote off the life and the glory of
[2:07:38] the water
[2:07:39] the seven logs in the water
[2:07:42] that john was addressing the seven what
[2:07:46] why did brother branham call the
[2:07:48] messenger of the pastors
[2:07:54] do you understand you cannot be birthed
[2:07:57] without your messenger of the age
[2:08:04] brother branham say that the message of
[2:08:07] noah
[2:08:08] do you follow me could not be used in
[2:08:11] the time of moses
[2:08:13] if moses went to egypt and say we need
[2:08:16] to build a boat
[2:08:17] nobody will enter there the people in
[2:08:20] the town of moses
[2:08:22] had a specific gene
[2:08:26] and that dream has a message that can
[2:08:29] only decode it
[2:08:31] you can bring the message of noah they
[2:08:34] will be sleeping
[2:08:35] if you bring elijah they're sleeping
[2:08:38] if you bring uh uh adam they're sleeping
[2:08:42] once you bring moses moses have
[2:08:46] something
[2:08:46] in his ministry that can awake them
[2:08:50] are you there are you there the message
[2:08:53] of paul
[2:08:54] will not wake you up the message of
[2:08:57] luther could not wake you up
[2:08:59] you were born under your pastor it takes
[2:09:03] a certain messenger
[2:09:04] to crack your engine because
[2:09:08] that messenger is the one from
[2:09:11] which side you are pulled
[2:09:20] do you follow me that's why brother
[2:09:22] branham said the messenger
[2:09:24] and his message are water because when
[2:09:28] he is giving you the word
[2:09:30] he's actually buffing you out of him
[2:09:33] that's why paul say i am glad because
[2:09:36] you remember me
[2:09:37] in water they keep remembering their
[2:09:39] father
[2:09:40] whenever they go my daddy told me my
[2:09:42] daddy told me my daddy told me
[2:09:44] he was perf under the messenger
[2:09:47] hallelujah lord help me
[2:09:51] that was john addressing the seven
[2:09:54] pastors
[2:09:55] all messenger as directly all
[2:09:58] christians under this what
[2:10:02] different what you must be birthed
[2:10:06] under the message of your age you
[2:10:09] understand now
[2:10:10] that is the messenger everybody clear so
[2:10:12] far you okay
[2:10:15] let's go all right yo
[2:10:20] we are no more in the message now
[2:10:23] your pastor when he stand here
[2:10:26] underwater
[2:10:30] ministering the water
[2:10:34] not craziness because the messenger
[2:10:38] brought you the message the pastor must
[2:10:41] stay under that channel
[2:10:44] because it's about birthing pulling
[2:10:46] brides
[2:10:48] do you follow me we need the correct
[2:10:52] doctor the correct obgyn to pull the
[2:10:55] brad out
[2:10:59] hallelujah he is god's word
[2:11:06] you okay now people play
[2:11:09] with choosing church they play
[2:11:14] my friends are there i'm going there
[2:11:18] he is god's word to the water
[2:11:23] messenger to the water this is now local
[2:11:28] therefore a pastor
[2:11:33] are you awake
[2:11:37] if you come later sit quiet and listen
[2:11:41] call carefully
[2:11:43] therefore a pastor should water
[2:11:46] leave that water because it's birthing
[2:11:49] the sons of god
[2:11:58] in other words there is no room for
[2:12:00] error in the pulpit
[2:12:02] that's right
[2:12:05] because if the birth is wrong it
[2:12:07] produces a stillbirth
[2:12:12] they're in the message they're dead
[2:12:16] because they manipulate the word
[2:12:18] deceitfully
[2:12:22] a pastor should never leave the world
[2:12:26] but stay straight with the world because
[2:12:29] he is what
[2:12:30] the shepherd wants you are in the
[2:12:34] place of god that's why
[2:12:37] you take time
[2:12:40] [Music]
[2:12:42] normally everybody of you
[2:12:46] should take your thought and go to jesus
[2:12:49] and give it to him normally
[2:12:53] do you follow me every one of you should
[2:12:55] take your thought and go to god
[2:12:58] and say where are you this is my thought
[2:13:00] and god take it and eat it
[2:13:02] but because god is up there he put a
[2:13:06] representative
[2:13:09] that take the thought and give it to him
[2:13:12] when you give it to him don't look at
[2:13:14] him
[2:13:15] look at me that's why character
[2:13:19] secret
[2:13:27] because he's in the shepherd place
[2:13:30] because the word pastor means shepherd
[2:13:33] look it up and find out if dying right a
[2:13:36] pastor is a water
[2:13:39] and the holy ghost has made him water
[2:13:42] over a certain flock not international
[2:13:45] pastor
[2:13:46] to feed them what with
[2:13:51] it's about birthing sons of god
[2:13:54] anybody clear this is not
[2:13:58] about just an office i'm a pastor
[2:14:01] i'm a pastor i'm a pastor i'm going to
[2:14:03] start eating taste
[2:14:06] shame let no man despise that youth
[2:14:11] timothy but be that what a what
[2:14:15] because you're taking the place of god
[2:14:18] timothy remember when they see you
[2:14:21] they must see me they must see me
[2:14:26] you must be an example to the flock
[2:14:29] because you are representing who because
[2:14:32] as a man you are made
[2:14:34] in there and the likeness of who
[2:14:37] that's why there is no room for game
[2:14:44] be dying an example of the water
[2:14:48] in water in what
[2:14:51] not playing too much
[2:14:54] because when they're approaching you
[2:14:56] they want to hear what is god saying
[2:14:58] that's right they don't want to hear
[2:15:00] politics or foolishness
[2:15:04] in water in water
[2:15:07] in what and in what do you see what
[2:15:10] strict office the pastor is
[2:15:13] that's right amen
[2:15:18] people ask what is a pastor and i was
[2:15:21] told you can't preach because you're a
[2:15:23] candidate
[2:15:26] i was told i cannot preach that message
[2:15:28] and i heard that message god gave it to
[2:15:30] me
[2:15:30] and i still never preach it what is a
[2:15:32] pastor
[2:15:34] tila come give attendance in water
[2:15:38] and to what and to what this is where
[2:15:41] the pastor's head is
[2:15:46] and azeroth consecrated his life is
[2:15:49] different than you
[2:15:50] you can do a lot of stuff he can do
[2:15:53] because his mind
[2:15:54] he want to catch what is the mind of god
[2:15:58] neglect not the gift that is indeed
[2:16:01] which was given to thee by prophecy with
[2:16:04] the laying on hand of the presbytery
[2:16:06] meditate upon these things give that
[2:16:09] self how
[2:16:13] that that prophetic may appear to us
[2:16:17] because people are looking at you as a
[2:16:19] leader
[2:16:20] take heed unto the self unto the water
[2:16:24] that's why i don't play with the message
[2:16:28] continue in them for in doing this
[2:16:32] do that shall both do what
[2:16:35] i want to go to heaven too
[2:16:40] i won't stay here for you i must save
[2:16:43] myself
[2:16:44] and then does that work i want you me
[2:16:48] and you both of us together go to heaven
[2:16:51] [Applause]
[2:16:55] hallelujah in no things showing that
[2:16:58] self and what
[2:17:00] people in the example we don't
[2:17:03] understand let's see how brother branham
[2:17:05] was living
[2:17:06] because brother branham was crushed to
[2:17:09] us
[2:17:09] the pastor christ to you you
[2:17:12] crush to your family
[2:17:18] induction showing water
[2:17:22] gravity sincerity sun speech
[2:17:25] that cannot be water that he that is of
[2:17:28] a contrary part may be a shame having
[2:17:31] water
[2:17:34] everything everything clear okay
[2:17:38] you understand the messenger you
[2:17:40] understand the pastor
[2:17:42] let's drop down to the husband are you
[2:17:44] still in love
[2:17:47] let me watch the time yeah
[2:17:51] okay so the angels
[2:17:54] here are the water but repeat it again
[2:17:58] we just saw that the angels
[2:18:01] messenger we show them that they are
[2:18:04] pastors
[2:18:05] everybody clear now we are men
[2:18:09] if you notice brother palmer in it is
[2:18:12] in the leader letter remember the little
[2:18:14] a the angels
[2:18:16] and the bible goes ahead he's talking
[2:18:19] about the water
[2:18:20] and he's what now man become an angel
[2:18:25] man and wife meaning what husband
[2:18:29] become an angel buckle up
[2:18:34] see that is what the subject is
[2:18:37] that is the way people get so confused
[2:18:40] in the bible
[2:18:41] they say well god say one thing here and
[2:18:44] one no
[2:18:45] you get off the subject stay right on
[2:18:48] the same subject
[2:18:49] that's all he's talking about what
[2:18:52] men and what when we talk about a wife
[2:18:54] and a man that man is a
[2:18:56] husband hey but here
[2:18:59] if it's a husband are you awake
[2:19:03] get this let your women

[2:19:11] in churches for it is not permitted
[2:19:14] unto them to speak but

[2:43:54] say look at this man
[2:43:58] first corinthians chapter 10 verse 8
[2:44:03] not for abuse for though i should boast
[2:44:07] somewhat more of our welter
[2:44:11] authority of who paul i'm about to
[2:44:14] finish
[2:44:16] which the lord has given us
[2:44:20] paul said that the lord has given us
[2:44:22] authority
[2:44:24] i'm trying to put a balance here
[2:44:27] okay that authority came from who
[2:44:31] the headship of man christ
[2:44:34] man messenger pastor came from god
[2:44:38] and i can even drive this to the
[2:44:40] governor
[2:44:42] and even to your boss at work
[2:44:45] i seen that i just pulled back because
[2:44:47] it's going to open another channel
[2:44:50] i have it that's why paul said when you
[2:44:53] do work for your boss
[2:44:55] do it like unto the lord it's another
[2:44:58] aspect it's just this territory is like
[2:45:00] this and i pull back from there to
[2:45:02] remain focused
[2:45:06] the authority which the lord has given
[2:45:09] us for what
[2:45:11] what has the word edification means
[2:45:15] paul says that we from the from god
[2:45:19] we the messenger the minister we receive
[2:45:21] an authority
[2:45:23] that authority we receive is foreign
[2:45:29] it is to build up are you following me
[2:45:33] for edification karma and
[2:45:38] not for what i should not be what
[2:45:42] the authority the position of the head
[2:45:46] of the home the head of your wife
[2:45:49] the head of the church the head of the
[2:45:52] church ages
[2:45:53] was given to man to build up
[2:45:57] not to destroy that's right
[2:46:02] oh my god jump to second corinthians
[2:46:05] 12 verse 19 and i'm gonna finish
[2:46:11] you there again thank you
[2:46:14] that we excuse ourselves to you we speak
[2:46:17] before god in christ
[2:46:19] but we do what dear beloved for your
[2:46:23] work
[2:46:24] everything you do is to build up
[2:46:28] you cannot be the destroyer of your wife
[2:46:32] you cannot be the one that crushes your
[2:46:35] children
[2:46:36] you cannot be the one that crushes your
[2:46:39] son
[2:46:39] or your daughter you should be the one
[2:46:42] building them up
[2:46:45] how can somebody go to a church knowing
[2:46:47] that the
[2:46:48] pastor is going to be after us you don't
[2:46:51] want to go to church
[2:46:53] why did your wife don't want to go home
[2:46:55] early because she knows if she goes home
[2:46:57] she's going for abuse
[2:47:01] your children don't want to stay home
[2:47:03] because every time you stay there it's a
[2:47:05] problem
[2:47:07] you took the authority for destruction
[2:47:10] and not for the building up
[2:47:15] second corinthians 13 verse 10.
[2:47:19] you there therefore i write these things
[2:47:23] being absent less being present i should
[2:47:26] use what
[2:47:28] according to the what which who
[2:47:31] give me the lord has given me for what
[2:47:35] and not for what why is paul repeating
[2:47:38] that
[2:47:39] i have power for sharpness but still
[2:47:42] when i'm bringing that razor
[2:47:44] it's not to destroy i am removing
[2:47:47] sin i'm removing bad behavior but i'm
[2:47:50] not there to kill you

[2:48:07] still at ephesus when i went into
[2:48:09] macedonia
[2:48:10] that you might charge some that they
[2:48:13] teach no other doctrine
[2:48:15] neither give hate to fable an endless
[2:48:19] genealogy which ministers water
[2:48:22] rather than godly water which is in
[2:48:26] water
[2:48:27] or everything you do for edification
[2:48:31] i can get through the gift paul say even
[2:48:33] the gift

[2:48:37] the church it's always to build up

[2:56:39] word heavenly father
[2:56:41] lord we thank you for your grace for
[2:56:43] your love your mercy and for everything
[2:56:45] you're doing for us
[2:56:47] father this is a heart searching sermon
[2:56:51] but it's nothing but a blessing and
[2:56:54] delivering scent
[2:56:55] in a simple way to deliver your children
[2:56:59] and take
[2:57:00] everything the devil has been holding
[2:57:02] their lives
[2:57:03] and their marriages for years troubling
[2:57:07] them where they thought it was maybe
[2:57:09] some major thing or they made a bad
[2:57:11] decision to marry this man or this woman
[2:57:14] while it was not that it was just the
[2:57:16] devil that played through the ignorance
[2:57:19] lord
[2:57:20] father to destroy their marriage to
[2:57:22] destroys the family
[2:57:24] to destroy the relationship between the
[2:57:26] fathers and their children
[2:57:28] between the husband and the wife between
[2:57:31] the deacons and the congregation
[2:57:33] between the pastor and the congregation
[2:57:35] because
[2:57:36] between the congregation themselves
[2:57:38] together until we don't trust one
[2:57:40] another
[2:57:41] and we don't even know who to trust who
[2:57:44] to share the burden
[2:57:45] who to speak with because these things
[2:57:48] has been
[2:57:48] lacking and missed in your church but
[2:57:51] father i have done
[2:57:52] all that i can do as a man under my
[2:57:55] office lord
[2:57:56] but lord father we all under you who is
[2:57:58] the great head
[2:58:00] the great shepherd may you come down
[2:58:02] father
[2:58:03] and give grace and sufficient power lord
[2:58:06] to help your children
[2:58:07] line up with your word and father
[2:58:11] there is going to be the blessings
[2:58:13] coming from heaven
[2:58:14] lord we thank you for them accepting to
[2:58:16] go a little bit extra mile
[2:58:18] with a sacrifice to let me reach those
[2:58:21] scriptures
[2:58:22] father may you bless them for lord
[2:58:24] father opening that channel
[2:58:26] lord jesus christ because it's a
[2:58:27] sacrifice unto them
[2:58:29] to sit lord father in such lord we are
[2:58:32] committing everything
[2:58:33] continue to minister unto us lord and
[2:58:36] those that have missed
[2:58:37] may you be merciful to shake the
[2:58:39] families lord
[2:58:40] that they realize quickly that this is
[2:58:43] what they need the best ingredient
[2:58:45] they need for their marriages is the
[2:58:47] word of god
[2:58:48] versus what they're trying to do because
[2:58:51] later on
[2:58:51] it might feel like what they're doing is
[2:58:54] working but it's the deception of the
[2:58:56] devil
[2:58:57] because two three years down the road
[2:58:59] they're gonna find out that they're in a
[2:59:00] mess
[2:59:01] and they need to come back and we we
[2:59:03] consecrated their life
[2:59:04] father may you be merciful and open
[2:59:07] their eyes lord by a spiritual
[2:59:09] understanding and give them the desire
[2:59:11] of the heart
[2:59:12] as we commit everything unto the hand in
[2:59:14] the name of jesus christ
