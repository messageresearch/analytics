========================================

living completely because you need to enter into another priesthood judah not only have the staff or the deceptor but judah also has a signal or a ceiling ring and judah also have the bracelet and the last thing will be roof who was never pregnant just like demo never pregnant even though married before but in the land of judah there is a boy that you're gonna get there or your pregnancy is guaranteed over there so we dealt with the two bread we explained it already we dealt with the scepter we explained it already and we dealt with the priesthood we also explained it already so today we're going to deal with the ring or the signet of judah everybody clear now to begin with signal what is going on in the land of judah with a signet take genesis chapter 49 this is our part six amen we're going to leave the airport sooner genesis chapter 49 [Music] verse 8 if you dare you can say amen praise the name of the lord verse 8 judah you are he whom your brethren shall praise your hand shall be in the neck of your enemy the hand of judah is in the neck of his enemy what does he mean what does he mean so when you see judah he's like this are you there his hand his work is holding the enemy's neck your father's children shall bow down before you just like joseph they have to bow down before him remember in the land of egypt and also his brother which was showing that joseph will reach a position of leadership are you there and judah also have to reach a position of what leadership that's why his brother have to bow down remember the dream of joseph verse 9 judah is a lion whelps we know that because the lion of the tribe of judah himself is the lord jesus christ from the prey my son you are gone up he stooped down he catches as a lion and as an old lion who shall rise him up which is a terrible trouble verse 10 the scepter which we already explained shall never depart from judah nor a what so in judah not only is there a scepter but judah is a law giver judah is somebody who makes law it's somebody who enacts law or makes rule if you want to know the law that will bring the jurisdiction of israel those laws must come out of judah everybody there is somebody who is there who draws up and enough to launch for you he's the one that gives you laws he's a lawgiver everybody clear from between his feet until shallow come and to him shall the gathering of the people be in other words judah will continue to operate until shallow which is cross come once christ come the priesthood move from delivering the levitical priesthood and it's transferred into the melchizedek now all the jurisdiction of judah is not all the jurisdiction of israel is no more in judah but now it is in christ because shallow came we move on with shallow because the gathering now should be into christ everybody clear but the key here is judah is a law giver he's somebody who writes law he's somebody who he knocks law everybody clear let's go to second samuel chapter 22 praise the name of the lord we found out that his hand is in the neck of his enemy everybody there second samuel chapter 22 verse one now if you dare you can say amen and david spoke to the lord who spoke to the lord from which tribe came david everybody clear a first king from judah was devin perfect will of god and david spoke to the lord the word of this song in the day that the lord has done what deliver him out of the hand of what all his enemy and out of the hand of who saul was his brother so god will deliver you not only for your enemy outside even the enemy within the message those that are so-called brother but they're after you are you there the other ecclesiastical power that is within the church the religious power now drop down to verse 38. david is singing he said i have pursued my enemies and did what he's from the land of juba judah and turn not again until i have done what consumed them and i have consumed them and wounded them that they could not erase yeah they are falling under mine remember every single power will be under there praise the name of the lord judah verse 40. for you have guided me with what so god is the one providing strength to battle for david he said them that rolls up against me you have done what so you never make a mistake to attack a jew once you purpose in your heart to attack a jew automatically you are beyond you are under his feet and the spiritual jew we found out was the bread so once you stop messing around with the children of god just know automatically you are doomed for failure amen verse 41 you have also given me what did you see that you didn't see that the neck of my enemies why do you have to have the lack of your enemies because judah is always his hand is in the neck of his enemy why do you have to have the neck of your enemy he said you have also given me the neck of my enemies that i met what destroyed them that do what so if you notice here there are two kind of enemies they are one that are pure enemies and there are others that just hate you without any cause but god gives you the neck in other words if somebody hurts you don't worry about it he's already powerless if somebody declared himself to be your enemy go even worry about him once you are standing between him they are already powerless the benefit of the land of judah everybody clear so far praise the name of the lord tap psalm verse 60 hallelujah the battle is not yours because david explained to us where his strength comes from he said my strength coming from the lord so once you are troubled with the children of god don't worry my brother you're gonna get it somehow amen psalm chapter 60 verse 7. if you there you can say man gillard is man and manasseh is man ephraim also is the strength of my head judah is my work everybody clear so far so we found out that judah is declared by god as being the law giver so if there is any law that have to come out to judge israel judah will be the one riding the laws everybody clear but what is wrong with that law brother branham now the seal is a sign of a what a finish work and we know that a seal like you are going to steal a box car well they put all the work in it and store everything up and then it is still till its destination any seal is a finnish word when you do what so when judah have to write the document when judah have to write the law he cannot stop only at the riding of the law when you write a document then it is what still at the end never seal until it is what so as the law giver you must have not only writing or the law written but that law must be coupled by a signet in order to certify in order to enforce in order to put into action the law that has been given are we following now if you look at our picture here of the signet when i blow this picture up you found out that there is two things in the picture we have the writing that is the law that is given and we also have a signet which is like a ring are you there and once the law is written once the document is written it is finished then it is completely sealed it is put into action and once they put the seal it means it is finished in other words we cannot come back and temper with that document everybody clear and if you notice the seal is on the right hand side hallelujah brother branham help us again now those two great things now we are going to start first upon the seal of god now what is a seal i love brother brother the first place a cell in the bible now we back in the bible back in the days before people had educated like they are now they usually their sin was there so when judah writes a document at the end of the document how they say president trump you take the seal and struck them everybody just like we used today our just like you said the name sometimes the romans and on back in jewish and way back in the early eastern countries holiday palestine and thing they have uh they have a ring a signal that they had their seal and stamp it on something so that wing that judah have or that signal on top of that ring there was an engraving and that engraving was the seal so whenever a deal is made somehow or a law is given the king always take the seal and step on it as his signature everybody here praise the name of the lord if they could not send their name dacio a seal was a bona fide statement in other words a genuine statement an authentic statement everybody clear original statement original title deed that is what that is was sealed by this seal to try to copy this was a capital fine just like he would be now to try to forge a check somebody's name on a check it was a great fun to try to copy this seal in other words you don't tamper with it and usually the man wore it had his seal worried on his back of his waist here oil either on his wing and he would seal it instead of signing his name everybody clear praise the name of the lord and there come a day then if a son continues on there come a day to what they call the blessing of her son so brother brother now is dealing with adoption everybody clear position placing then the father called a group of people together in the city he took his own son and dressed him in a lovely robe and set him high so everybody could see him had a ceremony and he adopted his own son that had been born into his home there is a difference between the breath and adoption when you are born in christ when you are born into the family that is called the new breath but you are still a child there are certain things god cannot put in your hand because you are not mature yet but you want to go through the training of tutor and administrator and at the end of the training when you are mature when god evaluates you then you're going to be adopted so adopted adoption in the bible is not like the word adoption sound to us usually when we say adoption we are talking about a child that is not yours and you take that child and you get him to your family that is not with the bible with the bible first you must be born into the family and after you are born then you are guaranteed to be adopted everybody clear so the blessing of the ring is not at your best the ring is given after you are adopted he adopted his own son i had been born into his home or bless him and when he did that son's name after that was just as good as the father's name in other words the authority of the father has been transferred into the sun everybody clear no problem on the check or whatever his signature the seal them this was a a ring because many of them could not write it was penitentiary offense to copy that seal the head on the back of the ring and they will mush it like that and he could wear his father's hand why his name was just as good as his father's world as the fathers was now that is what god is trying to get his church to to a place that when we are sons and daughters of god by birth potentially you are already a son of god are you there but for you to receive the full power of god that happened by adoption and brother branham say your behavior determine your adoption hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord now in the old testament when a son was adopted or placed into the family his name was just as good on a check as his daddy's was they had a ring them days a sun signal speed on it blessed there was a signal he wore his daddy's ring his signal and that was just as good as his daddy remember daddy remains daddy the difference between you and that is only the throne you okay now you start dropping praise the name of the lord when the people see you they see christ [Applause] are you there but trust is different than you only by the throne when jesus has been obedient jesus to god god bless him positionally this is him and when the member is born by the holy ghost into the family of god and has proven to have this virtue in him that god sees his virtue knowledge temperance precious brotherly kindness godliness in him in other words you are growing in the stature of a perfect man are you there praise the name of the lord then god seal him that ceiling is not the best are you there that's ceiling when you are born you are here under the pyramid but as you go to the pyramid when you get here there is another ceiling here this ceiling is not your birth but it's a ceiling of adoption are you there now when you listen to the sermon the statute of a perfect man when brother random said the it's like you get the holy ghost on top of it you are born first and brother branham said when you are born you don't manufacture those virtues they are automatically birthing you afterwards you don't lie anymore after a while you don't cheat anymore after a while the cigarette is gone after a while that temper is gone after a while leader by little up and later until one day god himself come down are you there praise the name of the lord he said then god kills him oh what so this ceiling is not the feeling of breath but it's a ceiling of placement a ceiling of adoption and that is when you see what and daughter of god now what are we doing we're talking about judah take now isaiah 33 praise the name of the lord hallelujah read those sermons brother i'm saying baptism of the holy ghost come back and fall back and forth you're going to be confused that is not the sailing of birth you are born by one spirit into the kingdom and you begin to grow you add this you add this you add this how can you add something you don't have are you there god said i had this how are you gonna hide that you don't have it show me why you have temple show me your temperance show me your virtue virtue is power how can you add power what do you have that you have not received you don't add nothing it is god adding to you you have nothing to do just surrender put your car in neutral oh my god when you go to car wash put your car in your chair are you there the car wash pull you through at the beginning they said come here come here come here after a while they say put your car in neutral then the car wash take off are you there before you enter the car wash you must pay a price [Applause] your price was paid in calvary are you there the car watch you are receiving is according to the price you pay and calvary paid the full redemption and once you enter you don't have to worry about it put your car in your chair let god carry you through don't work too hard don't figure it out he got everything under control relax put your car in neutral [Music] i'm gonna try to be holy don't try to be holy it is his responsibility not your responsibility that's why the message is hard because you're trying to put the gear are you there put your car in neutral then your burden is light then god takes you in and before you know it shopkins and the blue soap and the green soap and the red swap and the water is flashing and before you leave they say tyroshan amen let's go to isaiah 33 no more work roof resting [Applause] are you there ruth was not there debating with the elder it is boys [Music] oh my god judah the lord given isaiah 33 22 praise the name of the lord for the lord is your what amen the lord is ours so now the lord given is not judah are you there the lord is shallow given because once the lord comes then the transfer goes to shadow are you there judah was only a tap but the true love giver is the lord himself hallelujah the lord is your lord given the lord is ours i thought the king will come from judah and that's why god have to come from judah himself but when he come from judah that is shallow the power goes too shallow hallelujah the lord is our king he will do out praise the name of the lord text james chapter 4 blessed be the name of the lord hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh praise the name of the lord james chapter 4 if you dare you can say amen chapter 4 verse 12. are you there there is what who is that lord given there is one lawgiver who is able to and to do what so the power of salvation and the power of destruction lies with the lord given the lord giver can speak life or he can speak death [Music] a lot of fish can be dying and you can speak life [Applause] hallelujah who are you that judges another so now we found out that the true lord given is the lord jesus christ right he is our king praise the name of the lord if god is the lord giver judah had a signet then god must have a signet take jeremiah 22. we are dealing now with shallow hallelujah jeremiah chapter 22 judah had a signal judah was a lawgiver judah was the one that was writing the law when he finished writing the law he put his seal on it and god is our lawgiver and god also writes laws he gave the ten commandments the bible says the ten commandments were written with the singer of god are you there but does he hear the signal jeremiah 22 24 if you dare you can say amen as i live say who the lord darconia the son of jehoiakim king of what this king was wicked where what upon my you remember i showed you a picture where the sickness was where are you there cornell did something that was bad and god have to destroy him and god is saying here even if conair reach a position to be a ring on my right hand you follow me a signet on my right hand yet will i plug you from there god has a position of the ring and that position is in the right hand and god is revealing here that even though connie reached the level to be a signet on my right hand are you there i will plug him off because of what he did so there is a position of a signal that lies in the right hand of god we clear where is that position where is that position before i jump to that position let's understand something you ready all right now in this little portion of the scripture that i have under consideration for text it is such a little tiny thing five little words but what makes it what it is is because it is the scripture the evaluation of the word the word is so valuable no matter if it's one little word it is the value of the word the word was in the beginning as a a thought of god because a word is a thought that is expressed you follow me all right and then it become after thought a word is the thought expressed and when god thinks or anything you ready then when he expresses his thought when god speaks it becomes a sign document [Music] are you following me so the spoken word when it's released it is a document that has been sealed are you there that's why when god says let there be it has to happen because it was a declaration that was written and still once it's released it is finished everybody clear he said i thought when he expresses his thoughts he become huh and everything that god is worth the value of god and everything that god is is behind that word so the spoken word have the value of god and the very essence of god and the spoken word which is the original seed is a sun document where is the name of the lord you say brother stephen god is riding by speaking take psalm 45 hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord we are still cleaning with the airplane we already left the airport we already left the airport we are still climbing if you've been in the airplane you know what i mean are you there psalm 41 45 i'm sorry psalm 45 if you dare you can say amen to the chief musician upon shoshone for the sons of korra mask hill a song of love because here brother branham said when god speak the power of spoken word is a written document son so you can write by speaking a song of love my heart you remember this in living room my heart david is here he's a man he has a mouth and down on his chest he has a heart are you there david is saying that he's hurt my heart is in darting in other words my heart is overflow is overflow of is in doubting a good mother there is something good that is babbling within me i speak of the things which have which i have made touching the king in other words the theme of my thoughts the theme of what i have in my heart is concerning my king he concerned god i have the word of god babbling in my heart i have a thought of god that i have been put in my heart and that god is overflowing you follow me my what is what of a what so the tongue is the pen [Music] everybody clear brother branham said when god speak it is a document that has been written on son and david said that the tongue is a pen are you there that's why brother branham said when god said let there be let there be let there be brother madam said god was riding his first bubble he was rubbing the bible with a tongue but out of the abundance of the the word are we together how is god running second peter chapter one we almost gonna get straight in the air are you there praise the name of the lord ii peter chapter 1 verse 20 hallelujah you want to create you need to know how we work it's in the message second peter chapter one you there verse 20 knowing this first that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation why verse 21 why you don't interpret you don't play with scripture why verse 21 for the prophecy not in no time by the way of i showed you before that death it was a prophet you remember it's in the scripture i showed you the scripture so now peter is explaining you don't temper with the word because the word that the prophet speak actually it is not the prophet word are you there it didn't come by the will of man in other words in the head of david there is a brain the brain also thinks but this word is not coming from the brain it is coming from the heart you follow me okay he says for the prophecy came not in no time by the will of men but holy men prophets of god spoke as they were moved by god so when a prophet speaks something and something happened it is not the prophet it is god taking his thought putting into the prophet and when the prophets it is a sign document just as god himself talking [Applause] are you there when we say brother branham create the square it is not brother branham it is god amen my god praise the name of the lord the bible is a different book from any other sacred book there is no book like the bible because the bible is god in word form it's a word a word is a thought express god thinking thinking expressing his word to the god in sandra times and diverse mother speak to her father by there but in this last day by his by shallow [Music] are you there amen then they want the bible which is in one form so god take a thought instead of god speaking god took the thought and dropping a prophet and the prophet begin to bubble and the prophets speak and the squad take that and he write it down it is not the word of the squad it is not the word of the prophet it is the word of god [Music] that's why the message is a word of god [Applause] [Music] oh my god and jesus call it ah spoken word and as any seed will bring forth of it in other words when god speak cars don't expect nothing else by the car when god speak elephant elephant will come because the seed spoken have a potential and that potential will reproduce according to the original thought of god hallelujah bring forth the tonkan in the right condition the right atmosphere this book the bible this book of prophecy is telling future event now the book contained the entire revelation of jesus christ praise the name of the lord hebrew 1 1 i just spoke god in sandra times right there so when the prophet was speaking they were you okay now okay that's why brother branham said the bible is god in printed form are in the prophet he was a living god wrote the bible by his own chosen way he never wrote it by theologian neither does he interpret by theologian he never was the time that theologian there never was a time that theologian even had an interpretation of the word of god the interpretation comes only by because that's the pain god is using it [Applause] and the only way we are going to ever we are ever going to gather this mess it is for god to send us down you want to get out of the mess you need the message [Applause] just exactly the only way it's going to be done it's been belief watch and fulfillment it was not wrought by man but it was wrought by who thank you it's not a man's book it's not a theologian book it's a book of who which is a book of what prophecy wrote by god by the prophet and interpreted by them it is written by prophet interpret by prophet the bible says the word of the lord comes to the exactly so god is a love giver god has a signet the signature is in the right hand and he said that even if konaya be a signet in his right hand i will remove connie from there so that was already showing that a man can reach a position to become a signal of god do you want me to repeat it over brother bro the bible says that if conair was a signal in my right hand the right hand of god means the power the authority even if konaya reach a position to be my signet meaning when connie speak it's like god speaking are you there i will remove questions so that shows that man can reach a position to become a signating the hand of who who is that man that became a segment to god buckle up take her guy at 20 again at chapter 2. hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah if somebody is troubled brother maurice went to see his mother in a hospital so don't worry about it okay somebody will be like he's left no he went to see his mother so just relax [Laughter] hallelujah again chapter 2 verse 21 if you dare you can say amen he sure enjoyed the word everybody there verse 21 speak to who who is the robber who is the robber the prophet who which prophet are preaching who is zoro babel who is saurabh your prophet the seventh ancient message who is brother branham i guess they got a pretty good in the camera that is a rubber bill speak to who sarah babel speak to i can say a virgin shall conceive and i can also say mary shall conceive because mary fulfilled the scripture so god was saying tell brother branham when he's gonna come in the end time tell him tell him what speak to jeroboam governor of judah a leader in the brother saying i will shake the heaven and the earth you see that you see that so there is a destruction coming up i will send you elijah the prophet before there before the dreadful day the robber before the dreadful day verse 22 and i will overthrow the throne of the kingdom there is a destruction coming up that's why elijah must come before the destruction before i burn the world elijah must come so rob about will be there before destruction the kingdom i will destroy the strength of the kingdom of heaven of the heathen and i will overthrow the chariot sansa carmageddon and those that ride in them and the horses and brothers shall come down everyone by the sword of his brother confusion everybody clear verse 23 in that day tell zero babel in that day said the lord of hosts will i take you oh brother branham my what brother branampo the son of shelter says the lord and will make you ask her i'll let that sink in we'll make you us huh for i have chosen you are you there so that position that conair was rejected are you there was a position reserved for the rubber band god said i would take the rubber band and i will make soraka be like a signet i will take my power and put it in zoroable i will take my authority and give it to zola baby are you there just like a speak and it's final the robert bell will reach a point when he speaks finally [Music] take maps to chapter eight it's a rubber band i didn't even know i'm going to reach this point matthew chapter 8 verse 5 are you there and when jesus entered into capernaum there came a certain centurion beseeching him and saying lord my servant lays at home sick of the palsy grief is you tormented and jesus said to him i will come and do what this was a gentile he tightened his belt like me and he looked at jesus [Music] the centurion answer and say lord i am not worthy because it's a roof it's a gentile they don't have access to the commonwealth of israel but he was standing in front of the law given he was standing in front of the king of israel he was standing in front of the scepter made flesh because in the book of number god said i will send you a receptor which was crust and the centerion was standing in front of melchizedek the giver of the law the king of righteousness the king of salem mad flesh and he looked that king he said king you are forgetting something i am a gentile i don't have access to israel because the jews call us hidden but let me unfold something to you are you there like a man teaching god are you there like moses telling god don't do that and god scratch his head he said moses you are right and brother branham stepped back he said how can a man correct god he said no no no no he was christian moses [Applause] [Music] are you there two omnipotents were meeting when two omnipotent the miraculous camera are you there in other words jesus and the centurion were of the same species [Applause] [Music] hallelujah there's something your nation said lord i am not worthy i'm a gentile that you should come under my roof remember when peter entered to the gentile the jews told him you know you're not supposed to enter there he said i know i'm in israel i work here i know their custom nobody can come in my home when they come in my home they stop like amazon they live here on the door and they go are you there are you there i understand that you don't have to get in my home hallelujah you you ready but what speak the word only all i need is your word you speak the word in other words he's like teaching jesus he's telling jesus remember i'm a gentile you are a jew for us you don't deal with us with contact when you deal with us it is dealing by the power of the spoken word you speak the word and my servant where he is in africa where he is in south carolina sister grayson when mom is in the hospital you just speak the word and mama will be healed are you there speak the word and my servant shall be healed for i am a man under what the power of the spoken word is always connected with authority i am a man of authority having soldier under me and i say to this man go and he goes and to another come and he comes he doesn't have to write and say you come here give him ah when he's picked it is a sun document and he has to be executed according to what is on the paper are you there come and to my servant do this and he does it when jesus heard him he marveled jesus said my my my my my my my [Laughter] are you there jesus loved him he looked at the jews he said my my my my my my where is the species hallelujah and say to them that follow all the jews verily i say to you i have not found so what great what so that was god speaking to god because that faith doesn't come by intellect it was god talking to god but the god of the gentiles is higher hallelujah finally i say to you i have not found so great faith no not in what in other words when jesus said my my mind he stopped he checked israel under the loop zero he said in israel nothing but this faith comes from her and i sent to you that many shall come from there and for and shall sit down with who and isaac and and the in the kingdom of heaven but the children of the kingdom shall be cast out into other darkness there shall be what and nothing of what in other words the jews will be out but by what you are saying the power of the spoken word there is a people down the road that will come that i'm gonna deal with them according to what you just done right now those people will sit with abraham with isaac with jacob while the jews are going under tribulation period make sense because that's why brother branham said when the rapture comes the old testament sin will be in front of us because we must sit with isaac with jacob with abraham while they are they are in tribulation period are we following now that we understand zero baby must be the signal the power would transfer to the robot all right let's deal with this then we begin to sew straight i'm going to introduce this vision of brother brandon what i'm saying and it said i started looking up in the rock there was a brother that came to brother branham he came with a dream and when we came here for jim he said brother one of my had a dream i saw a big mountain and i start looking up the rock like this and look on in past the cloud so the mountain was so high until it reached past the cloud and the man could see past the cloud he said and way up there standing on the rock that reached from east to west a big rock reaching from the east to west east and west meet the gospel started from the east was going to the west but once he hit west there's like something going on there east and west a pointed shape like that like uh pyramid run back two days and said there you are standing there so on that big mountain brother branham was standing there it's a robot there oh no [Music] that i never seen anything like it in my life a great which color you ready in the book of revelation 19 we see christ coming down when he comes on a white horse everybody clear remember joseph could ride the stereotype of pharaoh we okay are we okay okay no problem a great white horse white man hanging down and saying you were dressed like here so he is a chief of a trouble he has a group he has a church he is the head he is the leader because when he went in the sixth dimension he was sitting higher on the chair because he was a leader a governor pharaoh still hired by the throne an engine chief with all the things that indian uses i won't get in deeper in this because there is a lot of stuff there i'm trying to stay focused are we there say he had ah brother branham had the breastplate paul in the scripture said put on the old armor of god the prospect of what the scepter he heard the breastplate damn what do you know what bengal means judah have what thank you jesus and damn bracelet on the army many bracelets many and all done iran

place like this walking me standing still and say you pulled on the rain went riding off to all the what brother branham was east going west remember sir what time it is all division was showing brother branham going where [Music] he got a big prince horse praise the name of the lord he continued he said then you went down you went on down that big horse turned around way as far west as you could if you go to the sermon say what time it is they will say brother brother who god will go and disappear he was going west for the opening of the in the coronado forest coronation okay you stood and raised your hand up like that then start crying said brother branham to see that horse standing there all that war bonnet and everything like that say that breastplate and everything do what when

was what brother branham was snow white [Laughter] there was one time that moses wanted to meet god and moses sat with god and talked with god for 40 days is he dropping when moses came out when israel looked at moses the face of moses was growing until moses have to walk like this the message is scriptural [Applause] are you there are you there well snow white like man transfiguration like jesus and adoption have taken place an authority has been given are you there the signal was there because the sword of the king struck his end you were standing there and you spoke with what there was no guessing to it no more joke every man understood exactly what you said because adoption was pressed the signet was transferred now let's land straight to the airport remember when we talk about the scepter we to understand the scepter we went to the book of esther now we are dealing with the segment so to understand more this segment let's go back to western in the book of esther there is a young lady by the name of esther and that young lady has a cousin by the name of mordechai take esther chapter 2 then we are heading this way take a step then we're heading this way esther comes after nehemiah after nehemiah before job if you dare you can say amen esther chapter 2 everybody at work esther chapter 2 verse 5. now in shushan the palace there was a certain what a certain what are you aware core sales searching is certain [Music] you know the jew spiritually speaking we're dealing with judah jew whose name was mordecai the son of jail the son of shema the son of kichair when the gospel left the jews was going through paul remember and benjamin was the tribe that cling to judah and they also took on the name jew clear who had been carried away from jerusalem with the captivity which has been carried away by with jeconiah you see that king of what the captivity was judah but it took benjamin also because benjamin was with judah remember naomi and ruth you remember praise the name of the lord whom nebuchadnezzar the king of babylon had carried away and he brought up hadassah that is esther his uncle daughter so esther and mordecai were cousins they were family [Music] they were in the same family but mordecai was older than esther mordecai was mature than esther okay for she had neither father nor mother and the man was fair and beautiful who mordecai when her father and mother were dead took for his own what this is two cousins but one is so older that he take the younger cousin as his own daughter so there was a big gap between mordecai and esther monica reached maturity before este they were in the same family both of them were jews but one had the responsibility of esther everybody here jump to verse 15 and when the turn of esther the daughter of abigail the uncle of mordecai who had been taking her for his daughter was come to go into the king she required nothing but what hair guide the king's chamberlain the keeper of the home appointed and as they obtained favor in the sight of all of them that looked upon him she stayed with the message she didn't take anything there so esther was taken to king adversaries into the royal house royal judah royal house in the 10th month which is the month of tibet in the seventh year of reign so esther was taken in the ten months and in the seven years you see ten and seven there are there in the tenth month of the seventh year in revelation 10 verse 7 are you there verse 19 and when the virgin were gathered together the second time then mordecai sat where the kings gave so mordecai never entered inside the court monica was outside the court in the king's day not in the inner part inner walls whereas they entered and the golden scepter was given here you remember inside the inner court praise the name of the lord verse 20. esther has not yet shown his kindred not her people as mordechai has charged her for esther did the commandment of mordecai like us when she was brought up with him so mordecai told herself not to explain who don't tell the people that they were jews and they were also related everybody clear now after these two characters in the book of esther we have another character by the name of nemo herman in esther chapter 3 if you can drop there everybody there everybody there amen verse 1 after big things did being a hazardous promoted heaven the son of hamedatta the elder guide and advanced him and set his seat above all the princes that were with him so there is three characters here one is [Music] mordecai the second one is esther but working with esther and mordecai there is a man by the name of heaven and heaven was a priest just like the servant of king of hazarus but a man was elevated above all the presses are you following me jump to verse five i'm going this way now job to verse five maybe i can do this job two verse five and when and when heaven saw that mordecai bowed not nor did him reference that was heaven full of earth so the whole kingdom were afraid of neymar of heaven but there was one spirit that resisted him when everybody bowed down that spirit stood up [Music] yes you following me i'm going straight wake up if you're sleeping verse six and he taught scorn to lay hand on mordechai alone for they had show him the people of mordecai because mordecai had people went for him and so to destroy all the what the brides right the jews that were throughout the whole kingdom of harasseries even the people of who the people of who mordecai have the people because when brother pronoun entered and went into the sixth dimension he was gathered with his okay jump to verse nine are you there and if he please the king this is mordechai let it be written that he may be destroyed he want to destroy the jews and i will pay ten thousand talent of silver to the hands of those that have the charge of the business to bring it into the king's treasuries then the king did what took his wing from his hand and gave it to the son of ahmedetha the god the what and the king said to him and the silver is given to you the people also do with them and seems good too so the king ring that was in the hand of the king the first time that ring was taken and given to him who had the position they give him the ring let's see him and a little bit let's check him go to esther chapter six before i begin to land straight to the airport are you there esther chapter six are you there esther chapter six verse six you there [Music] so haman came and the king said to him what shall be done to the man who the king delight to honor monica did something good he unveiled a plot that was against the king you all know the story then they never done anything for jail before nehemiah for uh uh mordecai so the king could not have sleep and they brought the chronicle they were reading the chronicle to him then the king stopped he said wait a minute what did they give that man for reward they said nothing he said who is over there in the kings it happened that heaven was coming to ask to kill mordechai the king said bring him in they bring him in yes chief he said let me ask you a question what can we do to a man that the king would like to hallelujah brother mark we could amen amen you there [Music] on verse six now heaven thought it is what the thinking of heaven was in what remember that no he thought in his heart to whom would the king delight to honor more than who so he thought he said uh-uh if the king wanna honor somebody it's gonna be me because i'm the one above his heart not in his head in his heart thank you and emma answered the king for the man whom the king delighted to know let what be brought which what [Music] do you see what was in that man do you see what what was he looking for after all the elevation the king gave him back he was still looking for what [Music] but you don't get in the throne you want to stay the throne will always be higher are you there but he wants the clothes of the king remember our king in revelation 19 had something written down okay let me leave it are you there let the royal apparel be brought which the king uses to wear and the horse i hope it's dropping if you are sleeping wake up i hope it's dropping i hope it's jumping is he jumping the horse that the king not a different horse the horse of the king and our king have a white military horse because in revelation 19 he is coming for war in armageddon in a white military horse are you there a man need the horse he never knew in the mind of the king the predestination where the horse for mordechai are we okay are we not getting good okay the horse that the king ride and the crown the domain but branham said quran is domain the domain the royal domain which is set upon the kings you can see here that the heart of a man was thirsting for the throne he wanna be like the king you following me you can see that here and let this apparel and host be delivered to the hand of one of the king's most noble prince that they may arrest the man with whom the king delight to honor and bring him on the horseback through the what so they want that to be public this is what he's explaining the king i wanna dream this is the king robe this is evan emman is there he said take the rope put upon me he was seeing himself take the king crown pull up on me to give the horse put up on me are you there and let it be public are you there let it be an adoption let it be everybody can see a ceremony where everybody is joined are you there let it be proclaimed before him before him that shall be done to the man whom the king delight to honor then the king said to him make haste hurry up and take the apparel take my version take my suit and the horse so the suit of the king and the horse of the king is transferred to mordechai when you see the horse it is the whole stuff the king but the one driving on top of it is not the king it is mordecai who is the one taking charge of esther the queen the bride are we okay are we okay there is a man in charge of the bride that man will be on a horse it's going to be a horse of the king the message is in the bible the message is in the bible my friend show me in the bible it's in the bible hallelujah take the apparel and the horse as you have said and do even to who that you that sits at them and let nothing fell oh that was what then two girl man diaper and the horse and the royal mordecai brought him on the ropes back throughout the city and proclaimed before him that shall be done in other words the fame of modakaya increased by a man a man who was supposed to bring harm become the one bringing the film you on the website they have subscribers that put thumb down like this the crazy website you continue to open are just bringing the fame of mother kaya more and more [Music] isaiah 14. are you tired okay hallelujah isaiah chapter 14 we're going to see who is human his heart thought that ah the heart of heaven brother robert we're okay i'm going this way i'm just doing this then we soar to the airport you're there isaiah 14 verse 12 how are you falling from heaven who [Music] son of the morning how are you cut down to the ground which have weakened the nation for you have set in your heaven said it is in his heart i will ascend into heaven i will exalt my throne my position above the star of god i will sit upon the mount of the congregation in the south of the north watch verse 14 i will ascend above the height of the cloud i will be like who are you there so the spirit that was walking into neman was the spirit of lucifer brother branham just about the time that jesus came on the scene judah came on the scene the antichrist and the one against christ i want you to notice the natures of this spirit now judah was a religious man he was not an infidel and all of us know that he was the antichrist he worked their very closest hand to christ the right-hand man of king are hercules did you know that in heaven that heaven the devil was god's right hand man are you there in the beginning that lucifer the son of the morning was given what god gave them this signet [Music] hallelujah in his pride went over in the north and set up a kingdom and fought against michael and his angel the right-hand man of almighty god was who heyman the son of the morning the first god granted him almost co-worker with him he was co-worker partly equal with him only satan could not what everybody clear we begin now to go straight this way now you know satan was god's right hand man you know he knows more about the scripture than any theologian in the world today satan was the original archangel of god he was dwelling in the heaven you ready he wants the greatest person in heaven outside of who who was the greatest priest servant in the king a hazaris outside of king hazaris with here he was god's right hand man to fellowship him and king of jesus and he got puffed up in what i believe there is nobody the king will elevate like everybody clear a man without character can reign because power apart from character is what he got power but no character are you there but power with character is referred to what you can be a lawgiver are you there and since he wants us to share even what oh my god on the basis that he overcame and he sat down in his father's throne then we have overcome to sit with what with him now when you look at mordecai that's the spirit that resisted heaven god i'm now going this way i just did this i'm going this way i'm i'm turning are you there and god and the spirit that is joined with god is one spirit in other words god and his children are one that's right now the spirit of god that dwell in the church is the spirit that comes from heaven that god knew before the foundation of the world that rejected the devil's word so when you are rejecting the devil's lives today and you are standing for the message you already did it in heaven are you there what you are doing now is only a replica a fulfillment on what you did in heaven that spirit had to take a body of flesh to take testing that's what we come to do he had to come flesh like this other did all of them put on echo yoke and god by the beginning know the spirit that would and which would not there you are that devil is so wise he just deceived the very elect if he was the reason why you won't be deceived because you fought the game in heaven are you there so just like spirits resisted lucifer in heaven there was a particular spirit that resisted heaven and that spirit was responsible for esther everybody there as we look at mordechai i'm heading to the airport there is five things important for mordechai if you're sleeping wake up one day there was a plot against the king and mordecai caught the plot and mordecai informed the king and the king life was spared we know that when everybody was bowing down to heaven mordecai stood up and resisted heaven we know that later on mordecai came and spoke to his wife and his wife's name is saresh you can look in the book of esther which means gold babylon are you there and his wife told him you want to be happy there's nothing you have to do go to the king and ask him to kill mordechai so heaven had the wife that gave him permission to go and destroy mordechai are you there then later on we're going to find out that god the king of hazards took the sickness from heaven you follow me and give it to mordechai and mordecai in this town was disclosed to the king over here mordecai was still at the king's gate outside the palace are you there okay but right here mordecai entered the king's gate but with queen esther he was working with queen esther both of them were family same family but one was mature and responsible for the other are you following me then later on after mordecai was given the signal he begin to write better to the other jews that were in the different tribes when we look at this five major event in the life of mordecai there are five of them we want to remind you that monday i told esther before don't let anybody know who i am and number two he was in the other court because in the old testament the people used to come only to the other coat because they went to holiness was closed you following me it's only in the new testament that christ died and the veil was split and open then we have access to the inner chamber or to the holy of holies so the first big three act of modern ayah were done in the outer court you get are you ready and the last two parts of monacaia were done in the inner court you following me okay let's head to the airport we spoke and we saw that when mordecai enter into the king we also remind you that he was giving the king horse when he was dealing with queen esther and we discuss a lot about the spirit of elijah are you there we know that elijah comes five times you ready the first time was in the old testament the second time old testament the third time old testament in the other quarter this fourth and the sixth time elijah is dealing when that way of the inner court is open when elijah came first he refused to bow his knee to bear are you following me when the spirit of elijah came the second time on elisha elisha was able to disclose the plan of the enemy are you following me and unveiled the plan of the enemy that he was talking even in the bed chamber the third time the spirit of elijah came he was upon john the baptist and herod he has a wife requested the head of john the baptist are you following me the fourth time elijah comes he's dealing with the bride and when he's dealing with the problem elijah is on the white horse you following me and the last time elijah will be dealing with the jews are we following are we okay are we okay dev gift the ring was given to heaven you say god give lucifer power in the life of job job was living his life but before the devil access job he have to ask permission are you there and god gave permission to the devil to go and attack job are you there but let's go to esther chapter 8. i'm heading to the airport this is the point we're driving now i'm heading to the airport you ready you ready esther chapter eight verse one on that day did king herself give the house of heaven the house of who herman is who lucifer okay give the house of heaven the jew's enemy to esther the queen are you there why the micah you got it right and mordecai came before the king you see now mordecai it's not the old testament it is the elijah of the new testament he's entering in the presence are you there and mordecai came before the king for who esther god had thought what he was to her now it's not the kinesthetic our brother before the king before mordecai were not brother that was the old

said a woman spoke brother branham deliver us from this [Music] you ready this is a what the house of heaven is handled by mordecai and say you have been misunderstood you misunderstood the people too say these are fun people and look over there and like a great big seller big wall down beneath a great big cave and great iron bar eight and ten inches feet thick and people out of their mind twisted
