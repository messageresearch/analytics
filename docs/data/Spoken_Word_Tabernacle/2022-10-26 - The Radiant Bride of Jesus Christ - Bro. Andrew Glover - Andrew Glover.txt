sun is shining we're a Believer when the rain has fallen we're a Believer when people are happy we're a Believer when people are sad we're a Believer when we're in war we're a Believer when we're in Victory we're Believers amen no matter what we're facing amen we are believers I I thank the Lord that we're following a prophet and a Vindicated message that has brought a stability to our hearts that no matter what we're going through we are believers amen God richly bless you this evening it sure is an honor to be here with you all once again and my the atmosphere is charged here tonight and just thinking of the prophet of God in the back room there saying the literally electrified amen and I believe that's what's in this building tonight is the literally electrifying presence of God Amen to lift us up out of conditions amen well God richly bless you this evening brother Stephen thank you for the invitation it's a honor to be here once again and I tell you I counted an honor to be invited anywhere but I also counted a great honor to be invited back somewhere so it is an honor to be here with you all again and we sure appreciate what the Lord is doing here in this assembly and the stand that you've taken for this end time word I pray that God richly bless you abundantly for that and I can see that he is and he has and he will continue to amen and if you have your Bibles tonight we'll go straight to the word we want to turn to the book of Philippians of the second chapter of the Philippians the second chapter and I want to bring you greetings from our pastor at home our church there brother Sean Martin the Saints at Faith Tabernacle bringing greetings from them tonight and my wife as well and it's a we wish she was here with us but it didn't work out this time but Lord willing sometime we'll get to bring our family back and you'll get to meet our little boy amen I was telling brother Stephen there in the back room I think we've been gone about two weeks and fixing to be gone for another week so she stayed home tonight but we do I want to say God bless her and I tell you I thank the Lord for a Godly wife that he's given me ever since we got married I think we got married in August of 2017 we went on our honeymoon and we came home and we was home a day and hit the road and so she's lived on the road with me and she is a true example of what prophet of God taught when he said God calls a man he calls his wife and I I want to say I appreciate my wife and her support tonight so we bring greetings from her as well and you all know me so I'm just going to get out of the way and preach that's okay amen let's just buy our hearts together tonight Heavenly Father Thy word is true and Lord we are very well aware that we're not here alone tonight but father there is an unseen host that is among this building tonight father there's angels that has lined the walls of this Tabernacle Lord father I feel your presence Lord not just fill it or sense it Lord but I've been taught under a word Prophet that wherever your word is the Angel of the Lord accompanies the message always so father there is not one question in my heart tonight whether you're here or not there's not one question in my heart whether that you can move upon the face of situations so tonight Lord we surrender to you as speaker and here tonight Lord may you take control of this service and father I pray if there be any needs here tonight Lord that you would help me to get myself out of the way that Lord I would be sensitive to your spirit that you could Lead Me In channels and avenues oh God it would be beneficial to your children Lord we're not here for show we're not here for performance or personalities oh God but we're here because there's a word that is called her name in this generation and father I invite you tonight Lord take preeminence Among Us May ever evil spirit that's unlike the Holy Spirit may it be driven back to the hell that it come out of and May Liberty and anointing and refreshing Lord May refreshing come into this assembly o God bless our brother Stephen father bless his family Lord bless this church Lord give him many souls for their labor give them Lord the desires of their heart as they have taken a stand for you in this generation now Lord we commit this meeting into thy faithful hands have your way among us tonight oh God we pray in Jesus Christ's name and all the Believers says a man and amen Philippians the second chapter in the 15th verse Paul here writing he says that ye may be blameless and harmless the sons of God without rebuke notice this in the midst of a crooked and perverse Nation among whom ye shine as light in the world holding forth the word of life that I may rejoice in the day of Christ and I have to that I have not run in vain neither labored in vain now if we could look back in the Book of Matthew the fifth chapter I've just been uh studying here the past few weeks out of these uh two portions of scripture and the Lord has just been opening some things to my heart and I just want to share them with you tonight in Matthew the fifth chapter in the 14th verse I find a direct connection between Philippians 2 and Matthew 5 and the 14th verse Jesus says ye are the light of the world a city that is set on a hill cannot be hid neither do men light a candle put it under a bushel but on a Candlestick and it giveth light unto all that are in the house now here is your command from the Lord let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works and glorify your father which is in heaven amen let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works and that they may glorify your father which is in heaven we ask Lord this evening to bless the reading of his word as you I can have your seats here this afternoon I want to about the help of the Lord tonight to speak to you on this thought if I title this tonight I want to speak to you on the radiant bride of Jesus Christ the radiant bride of Jesus Christ sometimes people say brother Andrew you speak too much about the message and the bride well I believe if there's ever been a time to talk about the message of the hour and to talk about the bride that that message is called I believe now is the time to do that amen looking here in Philippians 2 verse 15 I normally don't read many different translations but I actually come across this translation from the Amplified Bible of Philippians 2 and I just want to share it with you it says so that you may prove yourselves to be blameless and Godless innocent and uncontaminated children of God without blemish in the midst of a morally crooked and spiritually perverted generation amen a morally crooked and spiritually perverted generation among whom you are seen as bright lights beacons Shout finding out clearly in the world of Darkness holding out an offering to everyone The Word of Life holding out an offering to everyone the word of life so that in the day of Christ I will have reason to Rejoice greatly because I did not run my race in vain amen labor without results so Paul here is telling them amen that when this scripture is fulfilled amen notice this it's going to be a morally crooked and a spiritually perverse generation do you realize that we are living in the Fulfillment of that word amen I'll set you like this morals are at an all-time low amen you you can't find them in government you can't find them in education you can't find them in religion I mean you can't even find them in society amen morals rather than have reached an all-time low at the same time perversion has reached an all-time high at the same time morals have stooped so long amen perversion has been raised to a plateau amen were what used to be be condemned is now condoned what used to be they've been rejected is now received what used to be wrong amen is now right do you realize what that is amen it is to make this bride Stand Out amen amen I'll set you like this you were not born to fit in amen you were born to stand out you were not born Amen to be another layout of sin with another idea following another Doctrine amen but you were born to be the Bride of Jesus Christ amen you were born to hold forth a Word of Life in a generation that is dying Abraham said I have come to this generation amen with a Dying World to Adine people in a dying generation amen but I have the message of life I know it may not be popular to say it but I'm going to go and say it amen the only life left in this world is in this message amen outside of this message amen spiritual death is upon everything outside of this message Ichabod has been written across the door amen but unto you that he received the son of righteousness he is Arisen with healing in his wings listen friends I refuse to be watered down I refuse to be reduced to a lukewarm layout of sin amen sin loving church member amen God has sent us a message and it's a message of power it's a message of authority it's a message of anointing it's a message of vision it's a message of fire amen this ain't some cold intellectual amen chicken hatched out message this is the saith the Lord that has been released to this generation listen you're not going to ever fit in if there's a seed in you you're not ever going to fit in if your name is on the Lamb's Book of Life you can run to the deepest darkest pits of Hell amen but God will get you there you can hide in a belly of a whale amen but God will get you there if your name is on the Lamb's Book of Life then you're not here by accident you're not here by mistake you're here on purpose in the middle of a morally crooked and a spirit spiritually perverse generation amen God has given you the strength amend a whole thoughtful Word of Life in this dying age oh my to thank tonight we're not here to fit in we're here to stand out come on now brother didn't call you affinity and he called you an oddball he called you peculiar quit trying to fit in you'll go crazy trying to fit in you'll go crazy trying to be something that you're never going to be you're never going to be a layout of sin you're never going to be a foolish virgin you're never going to be a serpentine if you got representation in the Lamb's Book of Life then you were claimed before the foundation of the world and there's nothing in your past nothing in your presence nothing in your future that can change your destination it's a morally crooked generation it's a spiritually perverted age but there is a bride here who is holding forth the Word of Life The Prophet said Lord would you forgive us a many mistake or sin or trespasserole Mission amen transgression that evil thought has pierced our soul by the fiery darts of the devil that you would drive away this evil enemy of mine and of thy people and we would ask that you would send the Holy Spirit to take a hold of the word at this time as we yield ourselves as instruments that you would speak through us and hear through US Thy word may we in return receive it as from thee and leave this place feeling that we've been readjusted to the cause of Christ that we might be better fit for the service of tonight and tomorrow amen because of the visitation of the Holy Spirit bless our Brethren everywhere the churches across the world who's holding forth the Word of Life in this evil day we feel that there's not much time left to work for the night is swiftly coming the war clouds are floating again evil is at hand and we pray that you'll let us work as never before rest our tired bodies and send us back into the battle for we ask it in the name of the Lord amen for his sake we pray let me just go ahead and say this you are not a coward you are a warrior you're not a quitter you're a warrior you're not a Highland you're a soldier you didn't join this battle they meant to get tired amen you joined this battle to find listen I come by to tell you tonight amen there's Devil's heads that need to be cut off they're spirits that need to be defeated there's demons that need to be pushed by amen get up off your pity party and remember who you are you're not a bunch of weak church members you're Gentile Warriors who have been Anointed with a message to the eyes that has come from the Throne of almighty God to instruct you Amen to encourage you to appoint you to anoint you come on sir amen we're not quitters we're Fighters that devil might as well go ahead and accept the fact we ain't going nowhere until our bodies are changed I might as well go ahead and preach since I'm here amen I think I drove all the way down here tonight to tell you this this church will not fail it's the Church of almighty God this message will not fail it's the message of life this Vision will not talk it's the vision of almighty God we're not quitters we're winners we're not cowards we're soldiers we're not sissies we're Fighters we got a vision church we got a Finish Line the cross oh my what are we we are the Living Word We Are The Living Word you say the Living Word yes amen Jesus was the word will you agree with me Jesus what's the word remember said Jesus was the Living Word listen when the word has been spoken for this certain generation there is going to be somebody that's going to rise on the scene that'll fulfill that word because God has spoken it it's a Vindication of the spoken word and Jesus meant every qualification and was the word Vindicated as Messiah now watch brother and turn a corner here he says there is also words that are spoken in the Bible for the last days those words must come to life those words have to come on now amen do you realize when Jesus came on the scene he did not put Genesis 3 15 there he did not put Zechariah 9 there amen those prophecies were already lame there amen waiting for an instrument that would yield himself to the prophet word and what becomes the word would come from the written word to the manifested word listen the devil will not fight the written word it had been laying there for thousands of years and there was never one dispute but when Jesus said this day this scripture is fulfilled every devil and Hell raised its head up will come on church if the devil fought the Messiah he's going to fight the Messiah ants amen but the same word that spoke of the Messiah it's the same word and he spoke of Messiah come on he's not looking for your education he's not looking for your ability he's looking for your flesh amen you're redeemed flesh by the blood of almighty God to yield yourself to this message as an instrument to see fulfillment come to pass what are you saying I'm saying in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh do you realize what the body of Jesus was it was the word made flesh it was the first time amen that deity and Humanity had United together in a body of Flesh well come on now amen all that God was he poured into Christ and all that Christ was he poured into the church without this message it's all on Jesus without this message it's just a religious gathering but with this message it becomes a bride it becomes an invisible you Union between the Heavenly bridegroom and the Earthly bride what is this message it's a spiritual union this message is a spiritual union of Christ and his church now listen when the flesh is becoming word and the word is becoming flesh felt that wouldn't go through my body when the word is becoming flesh and the flesh is becoming word do you realize what's happening here tonight it may just look like a Wednesday night service it may just look like a few people gathered together singing a few songs praying a few prayers amen but I propose to you that this is word becoming flesh and flesh become in word humble Church God's not rapturing pictures he's not rapturing books he's not Rapture and tapes he's gonna Rapture flesh and it's going to be Holy Ghost Field players it's going to be flesh that is full of the Dynamics of God I propose to you that Dynamics are not coming but Dynamics are here [Applause] I propose to you that the seventh seal is open the third pull is in the bride well get out of here devil the word has become flesh and the flesh has become word oh God we're nearing the coming of Jesus to be United with his church where the word becomes the word oh God are you hearing me the word becomes the word do you see what's happening the word has become the word what a glorious thing it is he says for his church after 1900 years almost 2 000 years ago to know that he lives and we meet him on every Bend of the road at every turn at every place we go we see Jesus we see his living presence notice what he says amen flowing like a radiant light all right his living presence flowing like a radiant light from his glorious Church Lotus not defeated church but his glorious Church of the Living God how thankful we should be for that see then the LIE is his presence he said when he walks in the presence of the Divine person of Christ with the faith that holds him Spellbound to his majesty it isn't like walking to the wall to the altar giving the ministry your right hand neither is it not going to the pool to be baptized or standing with a shell to be sprinkled it's walking into a light that you have never witnessed before oh God it's an anchor of a Divine faith that calls anything contrary to the word of God and so it wasn't it puts new life it gives hope to the dying it gives courage to the weak it gives healing to the sick it gives blessings to the unfavored how wonderful it is to step into the light of his presence among Church you may be sick here tonight amen by his presence is here you may be weak here tonight but his presence is here you may be unfavored here tonight amen but his presence is here come on Church his presence his Blessing just not in a personality His blessings is in his presence then what you need to do is defy that devil and step into the presence of almighty God come on now amen you you say well by the end of My Flesh don't feel like it your flesh don't have a choice word is becoming flesh and flesh is becoming word but Andrew my spirit don't feel like it your spirit don't have a choice because the real you is not your spirit it's not your flesh the real you is your soul come on daughter of Abraham Come On Son of God rise up out of that weak condition rise up out of that condition rise up out of that defeated condition and step into the light of this presence it's a radiant light it's not a myth it's not a fleshly mind brought up it's coming directly into the presence of the king of glory oh I love this the Eternal Light of the Living God you're not stepping into a man's imagination you're not stepping into a fleshly idea you are stepping into the light of the Eternal God who is resurrected who is here in power oh my then what happens when you step in that light I'll tell you what happens you become radiant come on you become radiant whatever you become a part of you become radiant of it now I might as well preach since I'm here is that okay brother Stephen can I preach are you with me isn't it amazing that people can go for years and believe the message and never like each other but for a minute they leave the message they become best friends they become the best brother with the best Spirit the best sister are you hearing me you know what it is it's because they were not a part of the light they was a part of the darkness and Darkness and Light will never have Fellowship but for manifested word will separate amen the light from Darkness come on I might as well preach I'm here and if you tell me lots amen is letting a drunkard in the Pulpit if you tell me lie it's a bunch of Bob haired painted face women trying to lead people into worship I'll tell you what that is that is laodicea in darkness that is moral corruptness that is perversion from the pits of hell but there is a bride who is in the midst of such confusion but she's shining as a beacon of light she's shining as a witness of the Resurrection [Music] I propose to you spoken word church is not a hidden Church in a community in Gastonia North Carolina I say this church is a lighthouse say this pastor is a lighthouse I say you young people are a lighthouse I refuse to let the devil condemn you and dim you down to just another people you are not just another people you are a lighthouse [Music] oh you're a Radiant Church you're a radiant bride look at this word radiant it means sending out light have you all found can I preach my heart to you have you thought about how much light you all scattered in the past few years have you thought about that amen you scattered this light in a hotel you scattered this light acrosser community and now God has raised up a church and you're still scattering the light the devil's done everything he can to put out your light amen but this is not a quenchable fire it's an unquenchable fire this is not a man's light it's the Messiah light this is not a church lot it's the light of this presence I propose to you that this is not a church this is the radiant bride of Jesus Christ shining out a lot glowing brightly you're glowing brightly notice this of a person or an expression clearly emanating great joy love or health it has an emotion or a quality emanating powerfully from someone or something the father said we thank thee tonight o God that heal and Fountain is coming from God out of heaven with his radiant Powers pouring through it's enough to take a cancer-ridden person to Good Health to make the blind seed the death to hear but them to speak do you realize what is flowing into you tonight is enough to take a cancer-ridden person and make him a well-man it's enough to cause blind eyes to come open hormone church it's enough to cause the dumb to speak this light has enough power Amen to open the blinded eyes to unstop at their fears to cause the tongue to speak if it's got that much power that I submit to you it's got enough power Amen to turn your gray hair back black again it's got enough power Amen to raise the dead out of the ground it's got enough power Amen to change us from Mortal to immortality I'm not talking about a church Alliance I'm talking about Messiah light the prophet said we can prostrate ourselves give ourselves up until God takes his transfusion tube the name of Jesus Christ not another name under Heaven whereby man can be saved and transfers The Life of Christ into us then we can get so transfused by his power that we die to our own thinking and our faith becomes genuine Faith then the Life of Christ is transfused into us we become living creatures of God a dwelling place where the Holy Spirit can send his radiant blessings down through there and we're in the stature of Christ can I tell you what I believe I do not believe the stature of a perfect man was a waste of the rem's time I do not believe that Revelation was a waste of time I believe I'm preaching to people who have been baptized they've been transfused they've been controlled humble now they've been put together by the god of the stature of a perfect man listen I do not believe we gotta wait to the Millennium to see seven Divine virtues flowing out of a people I believe right here in the middle of a crooked and perverse generation there's some young girls there's some young boys there's some families that are displaying the seven colors of the rainbow they're expressing God's life you are nothing listen to me you are nothing but the manifestation of the gene of life that was in God as the Son of God now you're expressed are you hearing me that's why the devil hates you you've gone from Gene to expression come on now you've gone from Gene to expression in gene form you're not seen in gene form you're not disturbing nothing in gene form you're just a thought but when you move into expression when you move from Gene to expression you become a messiah you become an invincible Army you become Mighty conquers you become the Bride of Jesus Christ among now his word has come in you to light up this age you are expressing God's life because you are a son or daughter of God you are now made sitting in this church tonight because your duty is to express God to this nation this people this neighborhood where you associate see then the gospel tonight is not shining it is glowing the prophet of God said the gospel does not shine it glows he said see the little kingdom down in some little alley like here somewhere is glowing with the glory of God filled with a humble in heart God working in them Healing The Sick raising the dead casting out Devils amen just letting them pass on by Hollywood shines but the gospel glows Hollywood shines but the gospel glows the difference in shine and glow to shine is to reflect light amen clearly and sharply in other words you are reflecting what is coming into you if you're shining now let me prove to you that religion is a morally crooked and perverse generation in the beginning amen singers got up and they sung to the glory of God come down but to show you the perverseness amen Hollywood is now reflecting its light through a bunch of churches and now you got light shows foreign come on I mean it used to be that preachers gotten the pulpit and they surrender to the Holy Spirit and they preach without fear they preach without favor they stood there and declared the whole Council of God Amen but now you got a bunch of sissified men carrying a cup of coffee sitting at a table trying to read the church a Bible story living and seeing himself are you hearing me it's not a reflection it is a Shine from Hollywood but I submit to you that this bride is not a Hollywood bride she's not a Showmanship bride she's not a reflection of denomination she is a glow of the presence of the Eternal God she is Jesus Christ she is the word made flesh in her age you're saying I'm saying we are not here shining denomination we are glowing the Gospel of Jesus Christ what are you trying to say I'm telling you that Jesus was the glow of God are you hearing me Jesus was the glow of God he was not reflecting the Pharisees shiny pots and pans he was not reflecting the Sadducees ideas about the coming of the Messiah he was not reflecting amen the ideas of the scribes and the lawyers that had paid away for Jesus to come he was not reflecting on he was reflecting Isaiah 53 he was glowing Zechariah 9. he was glowing Micah the fifth chapter he was clothed come on church and that same God that glowed in Jesus has returned to the bride and the same God that was glowing in Jesus is glowing in a many-membered body foreign what are you saying I'm saying we're not a bunch of denominational chickens looking for shiny things we're Eagles that are looking for the glow of God the prophet of God said Eagles don't look for shine they look for glow and the real gospel glows with power with humility with love with power that's what the real eagle hunt hungry hearted Eagles reach for that just as hard as they can it's the pearl of great price they will sell everything else to go by it now when I start speaking to you about radiant lives don't think I'm not getting this from the Bible the Bible itself speaks of radiant lives in the Book of Job 11 chapter you can read about repentance but in the 17th verse he said thine age shall be clearer than the Noonday Thou shalt shine forth Thou shalt be as the morning Psalms 34 Verse 5 they looked unto him and were lightened and their faces were not ashamed notice where he puts this their faces were not ashamed in Ecclesiastes 8 verse 1 who is as the wise man who knoweth the interpretation of a thing a man's Wisdom maketh his face to shine and the boldness of his face shall be changed where is this light reflecting itself at the Bible is purposely pointing out the face come on now the light is reflecting in the face in Isaiah said 2 verse 1 for sign's sake will I not hold my peace for Jerusalem's sake I will not rest until the righteous thereof go forth his brightness and the Salvation thereof amen as a lamp that burneth the salvation of God will be as a lamp that burneth what does David say Thy word is a lamp unto my feet and it is a light unto my path are you with me my word is a lamp unto my feet he says Thy word rather and a light unto my path where do we go from there without a path can I tell you where we go we go to Matthew the second chapter where the Bible says that there were three main times which were star Watchers and they saw a star appear in the sky the Bible says we have seen his star in the east and our come to worship him we have seen his star in the east and our come to worship Him you tell me where did that star appear it appeared in the East where did that star lead them it led him to the West amen were the appearance of the Messiah would be upon the Earth come on church I'm not a crazy man in 1909 there was a star came down in a cabin it was in the East and it found a man upon the Earth and that star amen led him from Kentucky into Jeffersonville and that same star led him into Tucson Arizona and he received the seventh seal and he came back to the East and declared to you this is not Darkness this is light this is not a myth it's just not an imagination this is a word come on now you know I'm telling you the truth brother but I'm trying to get away from that star and he never could come on he never could remember him said can I preach a minute remember him sitting you know people say well brother Brad was a false prophet and you know that's what amazes me it's the same people say that are talking about a man who had hundreds of thousands of angelic Supernatural visitations and these nitwits ain't even had a bad dream laughs come on Church he was followed by a star he got on a train and a mind reader looked at him and said I can tell you the day he was born under I can tell you the sign listen what she said he said you can't tell me that she said yes I can he said prove it to me and she began to tell him April the 9th 1909. come on church we was born watch this he said how did you know that he said go tell this man his day she said I can't there's no star there I can't tell him there's no star there brother Kelly you know what I love I love the next word to that woman she said sir if you'll yield yourself to this you'll bless many people if you'll yield yourself to this you'll bless many people well come on Church we're sitting here tonight as a blessed group of people because the same star that appeared in Matthew the second chapter return to this age and set a light on a path this path ain't going to tribulation this path ain't going to destruction this path is headed for Glory this path is headed for a body change follow the star it's alignment to your feet it's a line unto your path we have seen a star oh God you know what the prophet called that he called it a great Shining Light you know what I love he says that star that those Mage I seen defied the laws of the solar system one star defied the laws of the solar system and come from a great consolation of heavenly bodies to declare something when it was fixing to happen he said and I hope you get this point that in this day can you is it possible to give me the picture of the pillar of fire of her brother man's head in this day God has defied

upper room that same pillar of power is white dot into 120 vessels and set an entire community on fire come on brother Kelly when they went up there they was cowards when they went up there they were

lightened by him and their faces will never be ashamed I'm gonna go ahead and preach her for a second if you're ashamed of that picture you need to find out who you are if you're ashamed of a picture

take all the pictures out of our church in case we get some visitors I thought how weak is your church how weak is your ministry that you can't even stand with a prophet you can't even stand with a Vindicated Supernatural manifestation that God is the father and for nails are you hearing me God defiled infidels to give you identification he defied religions to show you you're not following some myth you're following a Vindicated star and it's a Radiant Star I'm not a crazy man but there's a glow over this congregation right now I'm not prone to fanatics but there is a glow over this church can I tell you what it is it's not Stephen Chango it's not Andrew clever it's not William Branham it's the pit of fire that's film flesh the pillar of fire has found flesh to Residence itself in and show a world but Jesus Christ he's alive and well he still saves he still heals he still delivers he still raises it there he still cast out devils daddy my God's Not Dead my God is alive he's here

the word has become flesh and the flesh has become word what are you saying I'm saying as members of his body we are God's light come on now can I give you something the prophet of God said that light Matthew 2 LED three Mages all the way over to the perfect light come on now that star LED three Mages to the perfect light and said here it is are you hearing me those Mages have become that star to lead the people to the word made flesh come on now and the prophet of God said when they got to the perfect light they said listen here's the perfect light behold it stare at it look at it come on church can I tell you what William Branham was he was the seventh star of Revelation to lead abide to the perfect Messiah what was John Robert said John said I am a burden and a Shining Light and you followed it for a season it was not that John was false it was that the time was coming that John was leading them to fulfillment and he would say I must decrease and he must increase how about now the Messiah of the Bible is here he's Vindicated come on now can I preach to you John was not a glare of the Messiah he was a glow of the Messiah he was a sharp lot he was a clear lot he was a strong Voice come on brother when John stood there on the river and said Behold the Lamb of God but take away the sins of the world was John's 10 they're saying well now I think this is him you've read about him but now I think he's come you know what he did he confessed with conviction I'm gonna preach on in a few days Brother David it's time to confess this message with some conviction he is the high priest of your confession you've been confessing like a weak chicken you've been confessing like a weak denominational believer well I think I can make it I think I can overcome I think God can do something for me I come here tonight to defy that devil and remind you that you're not a weak chicken you are a Heavenly born Eagle it's time to start saying what the angel has said with some conviction behind it I am the brat I am a messiah I'm going in the Rapture the future home is mine I've got a theophany that Dad and Christ are going to raise I am an overcomer I am an invincible Army I'm on church it's time to Glow it's time to radiate it's time to let a lost and Dying World know we're not bound by Creeds and traditions we have been liberated what's wrong with him I'll tell you what's wrong with me I'm free I'm free I said I'm free I'm free from denomination I'm free from tradition I'm free from man's ideas oh the light has found residency [Applause] what is light can I have a few more minutes what is light it's the Vindicated spoken word of God listen I know that devil right now spotting this sound system and I'll preach right over that devil's head he will not defeat this word we will preach the gospel and we will glow with authority and power the Vindicated spoken word of God is the light you cannot lighten the Earth with flashlights are you hearing me you cannot lighten the Earth with a flashlight are you hearing me then do you realize original light was not electrical light you know what it was it was fire are you hearing me original light was firing come on now there was not one verse of the Bible wrote Under an artificial light come on now there was not one prophecy fulfilled under an artificial light created by a man who looked two wires together but the fire of God was the light in the beginning was God and said what was God he was a great light he was like a pillar of fiery a moon church then whatever that Pillar of Fire got into it become light do you see why we're not cold on a Friday night or a Wednesday night do you see why we're not sad on a Wednesday night is because we're not here under artificial denominational man-made lie we have been restored to the original light of God the pillar of fire has come back and flesh it's not a pain and fire it's a living fire [Music] what is lot sent for what is life sent for so you can see how to get around is that right then light produces life what is his word his word is light and life what did Jesus say I am the light then all that was in God he poured into Christ and all that was in Christ he poured into the bride the church then what did Jesus say I am the light of the world as long as I'm in the world said the one true God dwelt to light God dwells in light a sacred fire when he was on Earth he was manifested in flesh he said I am the light of the world why because God was manifested through him Jesus the word was the concept of God expressed in flesh when God was truly revealed he was manifested in flesh that's why Jesus could say when you've seen me you've seen the Father the works that I do bear record of the father are you hearing me oh God can I have a few more minutes brother Stephen Jesus was all the inspired prophets testimonies and all their prophecy was brought to lie in his age that had been prophesied for his age can I can I tell you what a prophet said Jesus lit up every candle of word that was in the Bible that was prophesied of him [Applause] come on Church what are you saying I'm saying Jesus was a living walking fire Jesus was a living walking Fire come on church that's why when he walked by the Widow named son she he got up out of the casket that's why when he walked by blind Bartimaeus he received his sight that's why he turned water into wine are you hearing me because those were candles those were Wicks amen but a candle Without fire has no purpose but Jesus was the fire and whatever he walked by he set on fire and that same Jesus is woken through spoken word Tabernacle tonight foreign Jesus is walking through this building time sister do you realize what you are you are a candle you are a wick I'm old sister Kelly you're a candle but you know what you need you need some fire and when the fire comes upon you you will go as a daughter of God I'm on Church you weren't put here to spit and sputter pot of smoke you you were prettier to be fired I set fire Jesus said You shall be baptized with Holy Ghost and with fire what are you saying I'm saying we've had enough cold church services I'm saying we've had enough cold intellectual sermons we're ready for the fire I'm old now what did he say he said all things are ready now Let the Fire Fall Church all things are ready now Let the Fire Fall what I propose to you that this is a wise virgin with the oil in her lamp I say almighty God Let the Fire Fall and spoken word Tabernacle not the Dynamics of the Holy Ghost burn in the church thank you the word made flesh is the LIE of the age what are you saying I'm saying that according to a prophet that Jehovah in the beginning broke into the heart of every man and now God is in us we are his hands we are his eyes we are his gospel the word made manifest is the gospel then you got to know what age you're living in you got to know what seeds you're under you got to know what messenger was sent to you can I tell you you are not a denominational seed by Billy Graham you are not a Pentecostal seed sold by Oral Roberts you are a spoken word Gene seed of almighty God that has been sown in this age the prophet said have you ever seen a time where a man's name ending with h a m is on the Earth right now to the church down in Sodom as it was in the days of Sodom come on now come on now that is a candle are you hearing me Luke 17 30 as a candle it's got a wick it's got a fragrance it's got an expression but there's got to come some fire upon it are you hearing me and the prophet said he sends a messenger amen the elected not to the nominal church but the church elected the Holy Spirit moving in the church is what does the works come on now I read you Matthew 5 let your light so shine that they may see your good works and glorify your father which is in heaven that wasn't the body of Flesh it probably vanished but it was God in that flesh are you ready for this showing that God would again dwell in the redeemed flesh of his church in the last days and would do the same sign what would you see the manifestation of the word if the word is manifested again today then won't it be Jesus today then what is the light of the age it is the manifestation of the word when you see it what is laodicea they are wretched miserable poor blind and naked remember ask the question blind to what the manifestation of the word representing the third seal he says the bride hasn't had a Revival yet I'm going somewhere he said it'll take them seven unknown Thunders to wake her up a manifestation of God will be the bride's Revival didn't you see the manifestation of God Is What attracted your attention come on that's why you're here you're not here for the sign and the Hand you're not here for the discernment of the spirit you're here for the word you are not a nominal Church you are a word born bride not a guard you're not a goldfish you're a rainbow trout [Applause] oh God come on Church you're not on the bottom of the pyramid you're on the seventh Peak you're on the Continental Divide you're in the third puck want to preach when they let's preach he said I will

Bible says when the enemy comes in like a flood the spirit of the Lord will raise up a standard against him when the enemy comes in like a flood the spirit of the Lord will raise up a standard against him come on now it's in a message called and no if it not he said there I was sitting at a table with a with a with a a a headdress on my head they said brother Branham all we can say is you our chief Authority he said I'll ride this Trail again I'm on church I'm not backing up I know exactly where I'm standing I'm standing in the second ride of the third pull in flesh are you hearing me you're looking for the ride you are the ride you're looking for the ride you are the ride what are you saying I'm saying get up off the ass he joke and get on this white horse and take that two-edged sworn and ride down these Devils that even trespass and have been close to the house of God come on come on I'm not a I'm not I am not a hireling I am a gospel preacher this is the trail ride of the Bride [Applause] you're riding to laodicea you're riding to shot him you're riding through sin you're right into destruction but you've got a fire shut up in your bones you gotta go in your church [Applause] well somebody shout Glory glory to God anyhow it's a fire it's a fiery it's a bride radiating with light I'm on Church the prophet of God said this age would go beyond the Pentecostal age he would say it's a bright age now Jesus said the light of the world then he turned and said ye are the light of the world the moon and the sun is husband and wife are you with me now while the sun is gone yet throws light against the moon until the sun comes and when the sun comes the moon Fades out and the church is the light of the world until Jesus comes and melts it all together the Moonlight the sunlight becomes one when Christ comes we go to the Millennium then what am I talking about he says Messiah ants okay I'm feeling good right now can I slay a few more devils I'm talking about Messiah they are the light of the church today can I tell you what a prophet said he said now you're a candle can I preach to you on the candle for a minute now you are a candle that sits on a hill that can be seen from everywhere we are the light come on spoken word Tabernacle that devil tried to bury you all but you shining brighter tonight than you did three years ago you know why because it's not the light of a man it's the Manifest that Vindicated spoken word revealed word of God somebody shot with me I'm a candle I'm a candle I'm a candle brother bam said watch you are the light David said in Psalms 18 28 are you ready for this David said thou will light my candle the Lord God will lighten my darkness Proverbs 20 27 the spirit of man is the candle of the Lord then do you realize what it is it is a Divine Light which comes into your conscience which becomes a discovery line I can stop right there and preach doors in the door the Divine Light comes in and begins to discover everything about you remember him said watch he said if you're ever going to sell this gospel you can't sell it unless they're hungry he said the advertisement the individual passing by has to see it now the only way the world will ever see Christ is when they see it in you and me can I tell you why the devil's fighting you as hard as he is right now because I'm on Church brother John we've all said it the only thing standing between this world and the Judgment of God is the Bride of Jesus Christ [Applause] can I tell you what a prophet said he said you as the bride could very well be the only chance the last chance that some people has got to see Christ are you hearing me he said they are numb to God in the sunsets they are numb to God in the trees they are numb to God in the creek they are numb to God In The Wind they are numb to God in the rain come on church but okay but there's a soul in a man that has been set on fire and your awoken billboard you are God's walking billboard you are God's advertising agent come on church can I tell you what you are you are a candle that's a part of the Candlestick I'm not going to read you all the scriptures out of Exodus on the Candlestick you can go read them but the product of God set them seven golden candlesticks they had little lamps on top of them that burnt what they burnt oil all represents the Holy Spirit Come on church and those lamps had to be lit by the fire of God now come on you know that Aaron's sons went in there to light them and they died at the door you know why because the Bible said they brought Strange Fire come on now they brought what Dr Dobson thought behind the pulpits they brought what TD Jakes taught behind the pulpit they was reading Billy Graham more than they was reading William Branham and they brought it behind the puppet come on with this Farm we might as well preach and the Bible calls It Strange Fire and you know what the prophet of God said he said Strange Fire come on can I preach to you I'm not going to read it to you I'm going to preach it to you the word strange means or harlot go look in your Greek dictionary and see if the word strange doesn't mean a or a harlot woman you know what the prophet called that Strange Fire he called it denominational fire do you know what he said Revelation 17 was the Catholic church was the mother and those Protestant donors were the harlots this Prophet didn't miss it he declared to this generation you leave that Strange Fire out of the house of God and welcome the pitifier you want to kill your church bring some strange fire in you want to kill a move of God bring some strange fire in him yeah when one candle was lit by the fire of God they taken that candle and lit the other one then they lit another one and another one and another one to the last candle he said see the same fire that burnt the oil he said in Ephesus was burdened in laodicea the same Holy Spirit lit by the same God by the same fire I'm on Church the fire that fell on the day of Pentecost has lit the candle the church through every age right on down here now brother miles how can I stand here and say we can expect another book of Acts because the same fire that was in the book of Acts has returned to the church [Applause] [Music] I'm on church I tell you can can I preach to you now can we go out here I'm preaching for a minute I'll tell you why the devil's mad he's scared a lot that will scare the fire that they will scare the light the prophet said Satan is scared of light any devil is afraid of light any creeping evil thing is afraid of light flash on the light and they're gone that's the reason people are afraid of these old-time Holy Ghost meetings Children Of Darkness work in darkness but children of Light walk in the light foreign can I finish this can I finish this then Jesus said let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works and glorify your father which is in heaven it's amazing to me if you want to listen to two powerful tapes back to back listen to let your light shine 1961 and then go listen The Works is Faith expressed in 1965. when brother Bynum opens let your light so shine he starts talking about Abraham being justified by his works he said Peter or rather James was justifying Abraham by what okay he said by what man saw but Paul was justified Abraham by what God saw then what are good works good works demonstrate the reality of faith in your heart that's why James said amen let that faith of that works is dead see works is Faith expressed brother Kelly what does that word radiant mean an expression a glow Works show that faith has already took a hold because our works Express what faith we have but if we're afraid to act on what we believe then we do not believe it works Express faith in God's promise then Abraham was acting upon what God had revealed to him come on now what is faith faith is a revelation from God then we could very well title that works is revelation expressed Faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word so God and His Sovereign Grace prepared the heart he prepared you before the foundation of the world to receive him in this age that's why you're rugged Christians that's why you're Gentile Warriors is because Revelation has changed you it has caused you to be more than a dirty old church member come on come on church can I preach you for a minute that's why somebody can get up here and say I'm going to sing a song about war and you feel the atmosphere change come on that's why somebody can get up here and say I'm going to say This Means War and you feel the whole atmosphere change because these aren't a bunch of denominational intellectual church members you are Gentile Warriors your Messiah at hormones hurt This

shall bruise thy heel you realize in 1961 brother man preaches the Messiah and says that's the first time Messiah is mentioned in the Bible go read Genesis 3 15 the word Messiah is not there but you know what is there seed [Applause] seed thy seed Abraham said what did he do he reserved himself a seed that devil didn't get everything and I want to declare to that devil here tonight he's not

God's Property Satan you've defeated discouraged robbed the children of God long enough we are not children of Darkness we are children of light we are not here manifesting unfruitful works of darkness but Lord there's a radiant goal that has come into this bride Lord I studied it the other day and it becomes so real to me your Prophet said do you see it he said to you Time After Time After

father I pray for this assembly tonight dear God I pray that your divine mercy and Grace will overshadow them I pray that you would fill them with such power and Dynamics and anointing oh God Lord that the young people the elders Lord the ministers the musicians the singers Lord but this revival that's burning and spoken word Tabernacle father it would move out that they owned the poor walls of this building what this revival would move out of books and tapes and pictures it would move into flesh and that flesh would move out into this crooked and perverse generation and they would shine as beacons of light clearly of Jesus Christ I commit this congregation in our faithful hands may you bless them tonight dear God in Jesus Christ name we pray amen amen [Music] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah let's give the Lord a Clapper [Music] amen you see how the world the Holy Spirit work you see how the holy spirit is picking up everything and even that which will be coming now and the next week's everything he picked it up it is not a man it is the holy spirit make sure whatever you do you shunning the gospel that you have been preached to make sure whatever you post on Instagram even the pose you taking on the picture even the move you're doing with your selfies and everything did you learn it from Hollywood or did you learn it from the message did the message told you to take a picture that way or did you see it in a movie star or what people are doing on Tick Tock and you just copy that and you begin to imitate and project it you are reflecting Hollywood and you're gonna attract the wrong man or the wrong woman because you are projecting last Hollywood was meant to project lust the way the women are standing the way the pose the way they do the eyes the way the flip around like a snake and doing all of that it's all projecting lust brother brand I'm saying even the movement of a snake is connected to a lustful spirit so sister stop posting those kind of stuff amen led to whoever is reflecting that's a Pentecostal light let them reflect their light let the people outside in the world reflect the light we have a majestic a brightest the biggest light because what you're doing they already got tired of it they see that all the time they see that on Facebook but Ibraham said the reason why homosexuality happen is because women became cheap so they have seen so much until what you're trying to portray online you are just coping after what they see so you're not impressing nobody but what gonna impress somebody is when they see the that radiance that glow of Christ that's my brother preaching labor tonight where somebody look and they see a reflection of something different they say look at this woman she's different look at her picture she's different what kind of woman is this let that one glow that's the one that attract the elect that's the one that attract somebody and say let me ask you a question where do you live who's your father who are your parents which church do you go to amen that's what you want to attract don't copy after this world because there is a trend going on in a message where the sister can still have long dress they can still wear a long outfit but whatever they have the watches the this that this it's copying every single move whatever come on the market they have it what come on the market they have it what camera they don't see that you already got caught up into a worldly fashion movement that you're trying to match not as you're trying to compete with the world and prove that you're on the page that's not going to impress them that's what they do all the time all the video you can put all the posting all the Instagram all the Facebook everything that you do they know about it they want to see something different and God gave us something different it is the message of the hour this message purifies us it changes it transform until when somebody look at you they say what kind of speech is this when you begin to talk they say which world do you live in do you watch TV do you watch what is going on in the world you say I know what's going on in the world but yeah let me show you this in Prophecy look what the scripture say look what the scriptures say that is the light that are shining in this Center when Jesus say be ye the light of the world he was the LIE he did his part now it's the bright time to be the light of the world so when you are on your work don't try to copy don't try to make yourself cool boys don't try to make yourself cool at work and say you know come on man come on man and so so so so so you can fit everybody they already seen that they want to see a boy different you say well that is kind of being uh aristocratic or whatever yes sir yes no that's what makes you different but don't get into stuff you know cause what's going on because oh cause all kinds of stuff stop all those kind of things I know what I'm talking about because those things come with peer pressure we don't want to be in an environment where we're changing but we want to make sure we are ashamed we are kind of ashamed of Our Gospel so we want to blend with our friend to make sure they don't see us as Cece amen and when you do that you are compromising and one of this day the people will ask you so you were going in this church to behaving the way you were doing I'm shocked this is the church you were going you don't want that testimony on you you want a testimony that we work with this person for 20 years this person is different we want to be like and you will hear people coming to you and say when you go to your church pray for my uncle pray for my family pray for something you know something is happening you have been impacting lives the only Jesus the only last option of Jesus people we see is going to be you what you put on your WhatsApp what you put on your Facebook it shows what you believe what you support and what you're doing you don't wear high heels don't post somebody with high heel because you're giving a wrong information you don't wear pants you don't post somebody a woman wearing pants you don't wear them because you're giving a wrong information the day people will know they say wait a minute you also pray in that chair so why do you behave like that no we want to be the light God is in this church God is working powerfully I've seen Miracle I've seen people's life delivered in this church I've seen people life transformed our sin demon that people thought to cannot go living in this church I just cannot tell you but I know what I'm talking about amen that's why I go home and I have a fight to myself because brother Brian I'm saying when he could he will pray and cast our devil when he goes back all the demon follow him where he was in uh in a hotel to try to fight him amen but one thing I know I didn't put myself in this position amen so when he comes I know where I back up and move forward and before you know it I'm free amen so remember spoken word you now put in this position for nothing I'm going to say it bluntly and I'm going to say it respectfully but truth is truth there used to be a message Church in this area never existed again left the message then there was another message Church in this area and never again and God took another church and put it back in here what is God saying what is God saying in this area this is the third one Perfection this is the third one what is God saying you cannot defeat my message I'm gonna put one there and prove to you that in the midst of a wicked crooked generation I can pull the bread and show you that I am God and I change not this is why you are brought in this church this is why you're in this church not to be in another church but to be the bride the word is made flesh and everywhere you're going you are the salt you talk to somebody you leave them thirsty until they say can I have your number I need you I need to know where you are I need to talk to you more about the things that you were talking I need to talk I mean when you're online you posting it I mean something that someone look and read the quote anyway I mean we revive somebody maybe somebody's going to trial and they click you and they see in like a court coming or a scripture they say praise the Lord this is didn't I mean this didn't just come by any chance somebody spoke to me that's what you want amen all your cars everything will be burned completely we won't use this civilization those stuff matters for nothing amen live your life privately with your family you don't have to put it up so people see you don't need it amen you are exposing yourself to the devil and to more fight for nothing amen but be what the word say and let God Work silently in your life and when the people discover you they say how did you do this say I have a god amen because you're not shining now you are glowing glow is like a power coming up it doesn't make noise amen that's what you want to be what a powerful message what a masterpiece you might need to go home and review this message and the Holy Spirit will talk to you more brother angel
