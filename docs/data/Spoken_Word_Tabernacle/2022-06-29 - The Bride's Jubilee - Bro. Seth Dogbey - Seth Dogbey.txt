prayer requests tonight amen amen so uh we're gonna invite our brother greg amen amen i was talking to brother sam this afternoon he said he wasn't going to be able to be here tonight he's going to stream i told him i said brother ain't nothing like being there brother sam i know you're listening in but you should have been here but anyway let's pray father again we come before you father and lord we just thank you for bringing us all here safely father lord we know the roads are very hazardous in this age that we're living in people rushing to and fro trying to and like your prophet said where are they going where are they all going in such a hurry lord but you brought us here safely father to to gather around your throne father to worship you in song and praise father but lord most important to come and hear your word father and lord may you break the bread of life to us this evening father lord brother shem lord what the prayer request for him father we just lift his name up before you father and lord with brother sam what he's facing tomorrow lord we just ask you to be with him father and and lord as i went the other week to the doctor for um a thing that was going on i told my wife i said they're not going to find anything amen and they didn't find anything amen and lord we speak the same thing for brother sam they're not going to find anything and lord let that word go forth father because you said your word were not returned to you void father lord as that little dub was out here when we pulled up lord walking around the parking lot lord that brother robert said some people would look at that and think nothing of it but father we looked at that and just like like the infidel lord that he said he lived in that in those mountains for 70 years and never seen god but you sent a prophet by his way amen and lord just through that little bit of time he spent with that prophet he showed god and that man died praising the lord and father we just thank you for these things father we thank you for the words of a prophet lord that we can go back and listen to father and rejoice over those things that he has said so many years ago but lord it's current for this day it's not words of a bygone day and father now we just asked the lord as we prepare ourselves to hear your word father that you give us ears to hear eyes to see but most of all heart to receive what is being said bless the the man of god that stands behind this pulpit lord and may you speak through him may we not just hear a man but lord may we hear from you father because if we don't do that our gathering here is in vain and we just wasted our time but father we know that or two or three are gathered together that you you'll meet us there because your word said that father we'll just commit this service into your hands for your glory your honor and let us our hearts burn within us father as you speak to us along the way in jesus name we pray amen amen we we have um special tonight from um our sisters man amen it's it's a special request for me amen i have two special requests tonight one from the sisters one from robert amen don't worry about time you you're good with time man amen so invite our sisters to come up amen [Music] so [Music] god bless you saints as brother greg just ended that prayer and said let our hearts burn within us right before he said those words my heart started to burn for his very short short testimony i don't know if you all know but i'm on our way down to florida we were in a very bad accident but no one was harmed car was totaled it was a one of the scariest experience i've ever had in my life in a vehicle but all i can do is call on the name of jesus like i've heard so many people do before and as i thought that this song was requested by brother seth and it says that we could just believe on his name and i thought it was very significant because that's all i can think to do and i believe he heard the cry and i believe he moved everything out the way so none of us would be injured including the children and everything like that nobody went to the hospital it was a quick transaction we had family close by and by great god's grace we are standing here today only by his grace i just want to say thank you i understand how precious life actually is and so this song will sing for the glory of god tonight i pray will be a blessing and if you know it sing along with us you say [Music] i believe you say is [Music] there's power in your name [Music] they say this mountain can be moved these say these chains will never break [Music] but they don't know you like we do there is power in your name we heard that there is no way through we heard the tides will never change [Music] they haven't seen what you can do there is power in your name so much [Music] we see a miracle now we believe now we believe [Music] we know the hope is never lost [Music] for there is still an empty gray can we believe no matter what there is power in your name so much power in your name move the ball break the break above [Music] [Applause] [Music] we'll see your mirrors [Applause] [Music] you are the way when there seems to be no way [Applause] see you guys [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign hallelujah amen there is nothing impossible amen when we speak the name of jesus amen amen

the new sound system come so we see what he does again amen wow wonderful amen good to see everybody tonight we greet you all in the name of jesus christ everybody got the candlestick pretty clear clear did i lose somebody no did i lose anybody oh my god blessed be the name of the lord i stopped somewhere short and there was one more almond tree that was left in the scripture and i stopped right there i went home i was like my god there is one more that was left in the scripture so pray for me and let's see what the lord unfold on sunday amen i was thinking about telling you that tonight i sat on my office begin to write and something open up and then the court came up so now if i tell you i'm going to be preaching amen amen amen i need to keep it do you know why they have to put the road in the holiest do you know why you got time take number 16. if you say amen amen i will go you don't want to start amen not me i just ask the question that's why i say are we okay nobody say okay so i have to pull something out to make sure somebody get are we okay you know everybody quiet so i have to pull again and you say yes then i move on amen you're there you'll be standing a little bit when the preacher preached so now you'll be sitting when the preacher preached so stan lord be no problem you there verse one number 16 now korra you know the story right the son of izar the son of gohan if you trace this in the scripture he was a cousin to moses the son of liver see he was a liver and dayton and abiram the sons of eliab and on the son of pele sons of ruben took man for the congregation and rose up before moses with certain of the children of israel 250 princes of the assembly the church is split right here famous in the congregation it's not going to happen in this church it would never happen here by the grace of god i don't want that to go back where it's pushing if we go back and happen on the one sending it go read the psalm famous in the congregation man of renown and they gather themselves together against and against make sense now so they were not just against moses they were against moses the prophet and against aaron which hold the priesthood amen why are they against and say unto them moses and aaron he take too much upon you you and your brother you think that you are above all the people in this planet earth that if nobody accept or believe you moses or be part of aaron then he's not a christian [Music] we all believe jesus christ we all preach the gospel we all carry the same bible why do you take too much you message believers why do you think we have to be in the message you you might be seated before i take something just a few i'm going to cut it short so they go so somebody will be meditating amen he said you take too much upon you seeing all the congregation are what [Music] did all of them get in the promised land jesus said they were all dead anybody here so they thought moses and aaron are arrogant they put themselves above everybody you see how they say that we message believer things we talk we didn't put ourselves there esther never chose that room he was chosen for her by grace she never came into the palace and said i want to be in a room so and so no the person who saw her just pick her up and say you go over there then we got in trouble with somebody that okay we think you think because you got in that room you above everybody i didn't say anything amen he said seeing all the congregation are holy every one of them in other words everybody is holy it's not just you and the lord is among them we also have miracles we speak in tongues we go to church we sing why do you think you are the only one that jesus will come and pick you the only one going to the rapture do you know the difference of age between moses and aaron okay let me continue amen wherefore then lift up yourself above the congregation of the lord everybody they thought that moses and aaron are lifting themselves up against above the congregation job two verse eight and moses said unto korra here i pray you ye sons of liver because they were liver too symmeted by the small things unto you that god that the god of israel has separated you from the congregation of israel to bring you near to himself to do the service of the tabernacle of the lord and to stand before the congregation to minister unto them and he has brought the near to him and all that brethren the sons of liver with thee and seek ye the priesthood also they already brought you closer but you are jealous about the position of aaron who holds the priesthood and moses who is the prophet everybody here let's see what happened you saw what happened here amen now let's go straight to chapter 17. i'm going to call the minister if you're there you can say amen you there and the lord speak unto moses saying you see the murmur you see what happened right amen and the lord said speak to unto moses saying speak unto the children of israel and take every one of them a road according to the house of their father and all their princes according to the house of their father 12 roads write that every man's name upon his road and that shall write aaron's name upon the road of who for one road shall be for the head of the house of their father and that shall lay them up in the tabernacle of the congregation before the testimony where i will meet with you amen amen and it shall come to pass that the man's road whom i shall choose shall do what it's a choosing of the lord amen shall blossom and i will make to cease from me the murmurings of the children of israel whereby the murmur against me against moses and who so the road blossoming is god shedding the mouth of somebody amen amen everybody okay everybody okay so if there are people that gossip about you and they talk about you and they say things about you don't worry about it just blossom amen the more you blossom and the more you are producing fruit somebody is zipping somebody else's mouth everybody here keep this in mind since you know the background now now on sunday you will see lords willing what happened amen but remember when you coming up nobody understood the golden candlestick why they were almond with fruit it took the road of aaron to unveil the secret that for you to be what you see here you must be into the holiest when you enter into the holiest then you're gonna bad and then you're gonna blossom you're gonna have a flower then you will have fruit and on top of that candlestick there was a fire did you remember that there was a burden there is a blossoming there is a fruit and a fire amen and that fire is the fire of the holy spirit that's why on the day of pentecost amen when the pillar of fire came he broke himself down in later amen entering into bringing the fire of god in the road and then the apostle which were road begin to blossom bad and produce fruit because there was a fire waiting right there it's for every single age it's written right there and it was locked into the candlestick amen so keep it in prayer and keep thinking about it god does it to block somebody's mouth amen matter of fact job to verse job to verse job to verse 9 amen 10 actually and the lord say unto moses bring aaron's road again before the testimony to be kept for what against the so you become a token against somebody who rebel against the rebel and that shall quite take away the murmurings from me that they die so when a road blossomed that's why you heard about the bottom say that's the thunder that is shaking the enemy amen it's when a life is produced from the tabernacle that say you don't have to talk you just move in and the life itself is speaking louder than even you're talking amen blessed be the name of the lord our minister tonight is also our song leader hard to get him off the piano to be able to preach for us amen because he got so much loaded on him but i have to squeeze him tonight by the grace of god that he's going to be leading the song and he will be preaching for us so brother said you can come on we finally believe um it has been a while [Music] all things are possible oh oh [Music] belief all things are possible only believe lord i believe tonight amen oh lord i believe [Music] lord i believe all things are possible lord i believe oh lord i believe oh lord i believe [Music] all [Music] let's take jesus jesus it is i believe tonight amen oh jesus is he oh lord [Music] jesus is here jesus is here all this are possible [Music] jesus christ here can we pray tonight father in the name of the lord jesus oh god father we believe tonight you are in our midst lord you set by your commandment law that where two or three are guarded in your name lord jesus of god as a witness lord jesus god there you are in the amaze lord jesus oh god we bless your name tonight lord jesus oh god we commit oh god this service into your hands lord we ask father god may you descend down lord jesus and speak your word to us lord jesus oh god father take me aside lord jesus oh god i have no word lord father as your word said let your word be true and every man's word be a lie lord father oh god

take absolute control lord may you take preeminence to light lord jesus god thank you lord jesus we bless you we give you all the glory in jesus christ's name we pray amen and amen amen amen we thank our musicians tonight amen we want to go straight to the scripture amen amen amen and you know as you know we we are musicians amen and sometimes the ministers call us to come and preach amen so just see me as a musician amen and let the lord speak to you tonight amen amen amen we want to open our scripture to uh the book of proverbs proverbs 25 amen proverbs 25 verses 2 and 3 and he said it is the glory of god to conceal a thing but the honor of kings is to search out a mother can we be seated amen amen amen it is the glory of the lord to hide it from any other person but when he has called us as kings it is his obligation to open up his word to us in other words there's no secret that the lord will hide from his bride [Music] he said the heaven for heights and the earth for death and the heart of kings is on such a way man i came tonight the lord has called us kings and priests amen so we are kings tonight and we are going to talk our skins amen amen we are going to talk as a bride of christ amen don't worry about time i mean i i'm a man with a few words to me i'm not going to keep you alone you man amen amen but when you try to sleep tonight by the time you you hear me talk amen we are closed amen so don't even try sleeping man i'm just going to be short amen amen let's go to the book of ecclesiastes event amen just close your eyes and you hear me say amen we are closed amen ecclesiastes chapter 3 verse 14 and 15. said i know that whatsoever god do with it shall be forever nothing can be put to it nor anything taken from it and god do what it that men should fear before him now 15 said that which had been is now and not which is to be have already been and god required that which is past in other words we are talking about jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever the prophet said god is not doing anything new today he's just repeating himself so whatever the lord has promised he's already seen it in the past whatever he said that my my child or my son my daughter this and this and that he's already done it in the past it is something that he's just repeating amen so it is it's just a word that i i just want us to look at tonight amen but that that is not our theme for tonight our thing for tonight is a bryce jubilee that is um in fact um last last week tuesday i i woke up from a dream and then the lord gave me a song and the song was about jubilee and then when when i woke up i could just remember um just one line of the song so when when i got up the lord started giving me inspiration i mean and and we thank god for this ministry amen that the lord keeps opening our understanding to his word so um the words just started coming and coming and coming and um we try to put something together amen at the end of of this preaching we're going to look at the song amen amen don't worry i'm a musician man we are going to do so many songs tonight amen amen amen so we are looking at the bright jubilee amen so let's go to the book of leviticus amen leviticus 25. it's so amazing the russian read from the book of leviticus event leviticus 25 will take from verse 1 to 13 amen and i'm just going to uh touch the surface because i know there's more in store in in in the tub knuckle for us man that the lord is opening up amen i'm just going to brush through the surface i know the lord is going to open so much amen i was telling my wife that if if we talk about one nugget bruh stephen can just or the lord can open in bruh stephen about 50 to 100 nuggets amen amen so we are just going to brush the surface amen conversation i said and the lord spoke onto moses in mount sinai one person in the mountain the word came to one person the prophet you have to believe him to understand his word amen one person in the mountain saying speak unto the children of israel it was specific to a people so the word of the lord came to one person going to a specific people he didn't say all the world or everybody in the world he said specific to the children of israel so when the lord sent a word to the prophet it is going to go out of the caliber of the prophet that is those who believe the prophet's message so i don't care where whatever you are hearing outside of this message the the message is to those who believe the message so when you're coming against the message don't forget that the message is for them that believe the message the word of the lord came to moses for the children of israel speak unto the children of israel and say unto them when you come into the land which i give you so the lord knows that there was a land that was prepared for them he said when he didn't say if he said when there was an assurance that the lord said when you come to the land that i give you when the lord has given us promises there is an assurance that the lord is going to accomplish every promise he said i am your healer come to me that i have learned amen and i shall give you rest hallelujah speak unto the children of israel and say unto them when you come into the land which i give you then shall the land keep a sabbath unto the lord amen amen amen now i i i just want to say something when the lord gives a command or the lord says something there is an expectation there is an expectation of a result so let's just let's just give a scenario that maybe uh i asked my brother here and i asked him to get into my car and and and i give him my keys go to my house and pick up a book or pick up a bible for me amen i know exactly what i'm talking about so when my brother is coming back i'm expecting to see that book because i know there is a book in the house so when the lord is giving a promise he knows that there is something there for you and when you are coming back his right is not coming back without the result it's not coming forward amen it's coming with that result amen so when the lord has promised us healing hallelujah it doesn't care how long it's going to take it is the word of the lord amen and amen i believe that tonight do you believe it amen amen amen he said six years thou shalt sow that field six years thou shalt prune thy vineyard a vineyard and gather in the fruit thereof so the lord is saying for six years you go into labor amen six years going to labor amen said but in the seventh year shall be a sabbath of rest now when i see this but it just points me to revelation 10 7. it's a but in the dress of the voice of the servant hallelujah so but in the seventh year shall be a sabbath of rest unto the land a sabbath for the lord thou shalt neither show that filth nor prune that vine yet now when we are showing something it means we are adding onto we are taking a seat and we are adding on to when we are pruning we are taking something out right but they say in this seventh there is no addition there's no subtraction why because it's a complete now when you think hallelujah it is accomplishing amen so when the seventh word comes to us it is a complete and a full word to us there's no addition there's no subtraction hallelujah from the first to the sixth the lord permitted some craps amen amen some addiction some subtractions but when you go to the seven we don't touch it amen hallelujah hallelujah amen as i said i'm just brushing it evenly amen a little bit he said that which growth of his own accord of thy harvest that shall not reap so we are not doing any touching here we are not reaping neither gather the grapes of thy vineyard of that vine undressed we are not gathering we are not reaping we are not doing anything to it is that for it is a year of rest unto the lord now now there's no work amen we are not doing any work amen but but but look at verse six is that and the sabbath of the land shall be made for you we are not doing any work but there is eating amen there is food for us amen hallelujah amen amen amen and the sabbath of the land shall be made for you for thee and for that seven for thy mate and for die hard seven and for that stranger that sojournet with thee amen it is a sabbath that comes to everything that belongs to you hallelujah hallelujah sometimes we just we just want to get up and proclaim amen and claim every family member that is lost amen everything that is lost in our house we want to get up and claim it amen because when there is sabbath it affects everything that is you amen and amen when it is subbed amen when your head is aching it is also affected there is no headache it's claiming the whole land amen your whole body a man has been proclaimed has been claimed by the lord amen and amen amen and for thy cattle and for the beasts that are in the land shall all the increase thereof be meat hallelujah and those are number seven sabbats now this is where we are getting to him and that's just number seven sabbah of years on today seven times seven years and the space of the seventh sabbath of years shall be on to the forty and nine years so we are looking at seven sabbats seven years seven times seven give us forty nine amen he said that shadow caused the trumpet of the jubilee to sound now it is a specific sounding of the trumpet it is not any sound it is a son of jubilee then shall that cross the trumpet of the jubilee to sound on the 10th day of the seventh month when we see this 10th seven amen it does something to our marrow amen hallelujah hallelujah i believe you understand what i'm talking about amen we we have our pastor amen that that always opens up this word to us amen 107 amen amen then shall cross the trumpet of the jubilee to sound on the tenth day of the seventh month in the day of atonement shall you shall you make the trumpet sound throughout all your land and you shall hallow the 50th year and proclaim liberty amen throughout all the land unto all the inhabitants thereof it shall be a jubilee unto you and you shall return every man unto his underlined his possession his possession amen and he shall return every man unto his family and jubilee shall that fiftieth year be unto you you shall not sow neither reap that which growth of itself in it no gather the grapes in it of divine undress amen so we see that jubilee is also doing the same thing as the sabbah hallelujah amen so i i just look at it the jubilee is the mega sabbath hallelujah hallelujah the mega rest for the bride amen for now for it is the jubilee it shall be holy unto you you shall eat the increase thereof out of the field in the year of this jubilee ye shall return every man unto his possession hallelujah we can we can't read the scripture without the interpretation of the scripture i believe you understand what i'm talking about we have a voice of interpretation in this last days and and if if you're still struggling while we read from the prophet amen the pastor is there amen he's a medical doctor we can just organize an ambulance to his his hospital amen amen you can just go see him it's an emergency man if you're still struggling to see why you read from the prophet that is the vindicated voice in this last day the voice of the lord almighty himself amen amen amen amen so what we want to take from the prophet amen amen i want to try to to hurry up with it amen amen amen so now the prophet said something here he said now now the pentecostal people have stopped now i'll be probably get plenty back on this that this coming from the message uh it's question and answers in um 54. is that now the pentecostal people have stopped now i'll probably get plenty back on this but i must be honest if i've got to come to the world there is no such a thing as staring meeting you've been in error terry doesn't mean pray he said terry means wait after the ascension after jesus christ the crucifixion the cleansing of the sanctuary amen and after the day of the atonement the resurrection the day of the atonement when he was killed and then it's 40 days until the ascension and then pentacles what we are trying to look at here is jubilee is pentecost which is the baptism of the holy ghost hallelujah amen is that a day of the atonement when he was killed and then it's 40 days until the ascension and then pentecost the word pentecost means 50. amen the word pentecost means 50. it meant 50 days after offering of the atonement amen and then after the atonement was offered everything had to come out perfect laterally geographically everything just as god said and pentecost it was a jubilee time and they brought the first fruits of the harvest and had a jubilee they brought first fruits so when we are talking about jubilee there is something called first fruits so when the bread is having a jubilee there must be first fruits and in the bible first fruits what did they do with the first fruits it was a wave offering to show an example to the people hallelujah amen amen amen amen amen pentecost it was a jubilee time when they brought the first fruit of the harvest in and had a jubilee now the first fruits of the church the holy ghost church the check that was to last these two thousand years till jesus come the first fruit come at pentecost and it was 40 days after the cleansing after the killing of the sacrifice onto the ascension of jesus christ he said go up to jerusalem and wait unto your endute with power from one high amen so we are looking at the baptism of the holy ghost as the jubilee amen or pentecost as jubilee and is marked by what first fruits amen amen now i want to take this message amen amen i have i have no message for you man we are under a voice amen so whatever the voice is saying is what we believe hallelujah amen amen this is coming from the message the 70th week of daniel amen amen he said a striking statement from the time god made the promise to abraham don't miss this from the time god made the promise to abraham that's genesis 2 3 to the time of christ being rejected i believe brazilian is going to explain this to us more amen to the time of of christ being rejected in 1833 by the jews according to galatians 3 16 and 17 and according to ashes chronology of the hebrews the power of god was with the jews exactly 1954 years god dealt with the jews 1954 years according to the chronology of the jews and according to the gentiles and according to galatians 3 16 and 17 i've got many more scriptures but just give that then after they rejected christ he turned to the gentiles to take a people for his name you want a scripture on that is that that he said acts 15 14. said not counting the time we find that we have exactly listen 17 years left and we will have the same span of time given to us as god dealing with us in the power of the holy spirit since 1833 until 1977. so he he was speaking this in 1961 amen and was talking about 17 years left amen so the same span of time of 1954 years god deals with us the same as he did with the jews how about that now mark down in your book a little scripture here i want to give you which we read leviticus 25 it said beginning with the eighth verse is that god called a jubilee every 49th year the 50th year was the jubilee we know that amen we understand that amen and we're ready from the scripture amen amen from the first jubilee of livik leviticus 25 8 in 1977 will be the 70th jubilee making exactly 3430 years jubilee means the growing up the release oh we are watching for the coming of that glad millennium day amen when our blessed lord shall come and catch his wedding bride away all the world the world is groaning crying for that day of sweet release when our savior shall come back to earth again say did you get that so god has dealt with us exactly the same amount of time that he dealt with the jews from the time he gave abraham the promise unto the rejection of the messiah in 1833 was 1954 years and now we have 17 years left we had about 1930-something years we got 17 years left until 77 will be the 70th jubilee since the beginning of jubilees so 1977 marked something 70 in the life of the bride amen and what will it be oh brother watch close now don't miss it it will be the jubilee of the growing up of the gentile bright and the return of christ to the jew when they go out of bondage amen don't you see from all the world they've gathered there for that day oh my see where we are at we don't we don't know what time it might happen we are at the end time amen the prophet said we are at the end time so now listen to you old timers here in the church that's been here for a long time i want you to notice something i never learned this until yesterday i picked it up from historian poor boyd and then i've and then i've traced it back to the scriptures picked up these other dates here and so forth and got it and run it trust it true amen amen so the prophet is making us to understand that we are in the 70 of jubilee when jubilee started amen amen and 70 means something to us amen hallelujah amen now i amen the first said something that i just want us to um to talk about even if you are not able to finish it man said and i took a note from it said jubilee is preceded by trials and temptations amen if amen i have permission from the pastor amen amen now the prophet is saying something that this number 40 means trials and temptations amen i don't know if i want to read a quote but amen forgive me amen amen from the message spiritual adoption amen preached in 1916 1956 he said the prophet said 50 is his number of jubilee 40 is his number of temptation he met amen and and and when i was looking at this number amen for the means temptation amen now 40 comes before 50. so there is something so hard here that we have to go through before we start shouting here amen and you know you know the uh the israelites were in the wilderness for how many years 40 years they were being tried and tempted and and we understand to the preaching amen that before you go to the holiest you must be proven that you really are a child of god amen and and and and this 40 that we see here is trying our faith to see if we really believe what we said from the beginning amen amen but one very interesting thing about this 40 is that there is this number four amen so if i break it into two women i have four and zero so even though we are going through our trials amen god is telling us of deliverance hallelujah and when you add this to it it is an eternal deliverance amen this word is speaking to me amen we go to our trials we go through our temptations but the lord is telling us that there is a deliverance and it is an eternal deliverance it doesn't matter how long it's going to take therefore is telling us there is a deliverance amen so before we get here we have to go through this and then there comes 50 which is jubilee and the prophet said jubilee is i want to read amen amen as brad stephen said the bible said but abraham said amen amen it is not but a stephen said or whoever stands here said amen we want to read from the prophet hallelujah amen hallelujah amen and amen amen now this is from the message from the message go tell preach in sixth 1960 amen paragraph reading from paragraph 87 said in the bible time there was a jubilee year come people that were sold out for debts that they owed they owed a debt and they could not pay it so they went and sold themselves to people for slaves so they were owing people they couldn't pay so they went to um sell themselves to people for slaves so they had to beat their slave they are born slaves all their life but every so often there come a day of grace what was known as jubilee year so the prophet is saying that jubilee is also the day of grace and as we know god works in numbers amen so when i'm seeing jubilee i'm seeing grace hallelujah eternal grace hallelujah so when the lord sells jubilee to the bride it is an eternal jubilee hallelujah amen i mean for for the sake of time amen we just want to take some scriptures amen i just want to take this one quote and then i read the scripture amen amen then i bring it to a close amen amen don't worry amen hallelujah all right this message this from return and jubilee preach in 1962 he said s7 now remember a seven gets his reward or his wages but he was never to be free in the jubilee no sir a seven was not free in the jubilee that was not born an israelite [Music] so this servant that the prophet is talking about is the one that is not an israelite we are going to read from the scripture amen he had to be born in order to be free in the jubilee so before jubilee comes to you you must be an israelite before the bride's jubilee come to you you must be a bride that is why the message was going to the bride or the message was going to israel amen and many people get their rewards jesus said about the hypocrites said they have their rewards but you are different you and i we are different amen so yes that's what jesus was saying in john 8 about the jews they said we are free he said the seven does not abide in the house but when he gave them bread they was no longer servant they were sons and joined us with him in the kingdom that's the way the church is is join us with christ in the kingdom as of all things to god through him now we find that the church moved off in the same direction that his forefathers moved in the first organizations of churches it's been that way down to the ages but they are never never the servants but they are never never their servants will not be free they will not hear the word they will not believe the word why because the word was not made for them the word was made for us so the servants they heard the trumpet sound that priest riding through the land sounding this trumpet that every man was free sounded out throughout liberty all out the land and every man that was born a jew know he could go back to his inheritance i don't care how far he was sold what happened he could go back because he was born in the house he was in his father's house born but the seven didn't know what he was doing oh my so both of them were working for the same master sword and the sin many a pentecostal tonight is so the same way amen so you have two types of servant amen working for the master when the jubilee is sounded one has the right to be free but the other does not have the right to go hallelujah amen we want to read um exodus 21 1-6 exodus 21 1-6 so now these are the judgments which thou shalt set before them if thou by an hebrew servant specific hebrew seventh and israelites amen six years he shall serve and in the seventh year he shall go out free for nothing amen if he came in by himself he shall go out by himself if he were married then his wife shall go out with him whatever possession he had that he brought in when the jubilee sounded he takes his possession back amen if his master has given him a wife and she have borne him sons and daughters their wife and her children shall be her masters he shall go out by himself because he is going back to his possession what he owned from the beginning amen he said and if the servant shall plainly say i love my master my wife and my children i will not go out free then this master shall bring him unto the judges he shall also bring him to the door or onto the doorpost and his master shall board his ear through with and all and he shall save him forever and we know um what that meant where they put the ear ring in in their ear showing that they are slaves to their master amen that when the sounding came they didn't hear any sound the sound does not apply to them [Music] amen amen hallelujah so we can see a lot of people who are still slaves to masters who are not free amen we we we do not judge people people judge themselves i told my wife that when somebody says why are you judging why are you judging me i'm like okay i am not judging you i'm just looking at you and describing who you are that is not the judgment you yourself have judged yourself amen amen amen amen darshan jack amen so when when when you are you are a man and decide to be a woman and i look at you and i'm confused you tell me that shall not judge i'm confused i'm not judging you you have put on a nature that i'm looking at i'm just describing what i'm saying i'm not judging you amen amen amen hallelujah i believe somebody is blessed tonight amen amen amen i just said we want to keep it short we want like hallelujah amen i know i know one of these days the brother who is just shouting preach might be called here amen hallelujah amen amen amen amen forgive me i'm just taking um two quotes and then we are done as i said i don't have a message amen amen so this from the uh the message return and jubilee that same message preaching 62 program 145. he said the sounding of the trumpet yes sir return dispersed but if you sold your inheritance if you sold out and done these things what am i saying return back is that if you join up with some courts that tries to keep you away from fellowship with other brethren leave the thing this is jubilee amen he said i feel religious return return this is jubilee don't let it pass by remember don't let it pass by if you sort out if you went out in the world if you've seen you know that you once had the experience you went and joined up where you can't fellowship with the rest of them you've done all these things i don't care what you've done if you're a son you have a right to return now because his jubilee is jubilee time hallelujah amen the prophet said this in the chosen of her bride he said remember when the jubilee year come and the priest wrote with his trumpet sounding that every slave could go free but if they refused to accept their freedom then he had to be taken to the temple to a post and an all brought him through the ear and then he served his master always it was put on his ear as a typing of hearing faith cometh by hearing he heard the trump that trumpet but he didn't want to listen to ricks hallelujah so when we put that in there it means there is no faith there's no more faith amen now the message the spoken word is original seed paragraph 20 says is that there is three comings of christ he came once to redeem his bride he comes next in the rapture to catch away his bride he comes again in a millennium with his bride everything increase three is a perfect number five is the number of grace seven completion two of worship 24 or 40 tempted and 50 is the jubilee the very word pentecost means jubilee 50 see now and now god in his numerals he's perfect in his numerous means his numbers amen he's perfect in his word he's perfect in his action he's perfect in everything because he's a perfect god hallelujah amen and amen amen um i've got a song tonight man that's i'm trying to keep things short amen um just give me five minutes amen um i asked permission from the past i meant and he said it's all right man if i can share this song as as i said i tried um with the lord's help i tried to put some words together i just had one line you mean one line and i have like i don't know i have three verses with the chorus it means i'm trying to find a key for myself man [Music] hallelujah if the

with jubilee you understand the 49 days 49 years 7 times 7 and the 50th the jubilee you understand that clear right do you understand why jubilee and the sabbath are doing the same thing why the seven and the f are the same thing [Laughter] amen blessed be the name of the lord the jubilee of the brother amen blessed be the name of the lord that was wonderful brother said god greatly bless you amen hallelujah amen if you go with your tenth number everybody okay you have a few minutes you have a few minutes zero one two three four five six seven oh six seven eight and then what amen everything else is a combination right right 10 is a combination and zero and one amen if you keep seven right here take one all the way to seven what follow seven everybody okay if you take 50 days and you break it down in seven everybody okay you have seven which goes one through seven you have another seven you have another seven we okay one through seven one through seven you have another seven one through seven you have another seven are we okay one through seven one two three four five you have another seven everybody here which is one through seven everybody okay then we have another seven this is one two three four five six seven which is one through seven right so if you go seven seven seven seven seven seven seven all together he gave you how much we're missing one day everybody here if we put that one here which number will follow a seven okay everybody okay so the 50th day is an eighth today everybody okay and brother branham said all these seven times taps the church ages you need the coach you see me brother branham say these seven here this is ephesus this there is a time frame it goes from the beginning to its completion and it's finished then smyrna taken from its beginning all the way to its completion and then you have pergamus and then you have tartarian and then you have sardis then you have philadelphia and then you have laodicea anybody care everybody okay so far so laudisha gave he's one and seven but the bride is not here everybody okay the bride is in the brad age everybody here which is the eighth day everybody here but you are not outside the 50. you are still in the 50. so that's why the rupture have not taken place yet everybody okay so far everybody good everybody okay so our seven blend with our eight [Music] are we okay we are on the sabbath here but this sabbath is taking out is taking us out of the low edition age into the broad age what happened the one who does that is the coming down of the mighty angel that's why it takes place in 10 the 10th day of the seventh month according to revelation 10 7 because in revelation 10 7 the heaven have opened and now the heaven is blending with the earth so even though we are living under laodicea but we are not in laodicea healing so this part is egypt everybody okay but this one is goshen whatever happened in egypt it doesn't happen in goshen amen amen anybody okay blessed be the name of the lord let's go to first samuel chapter 16. i'm doing that so if somebody got lost you pick it up amen everybody okay so far so when we say seven times seven it's 49 this is what we mean and the 50th day is jubilee amen amen amen so there is a sabbath here amen and there is a jubilee right there and the jew belief you notice in the scripture it happened on the day of atonement amen everybody here so this day is a day that is blended with the atonement when we say atonement it means that they are killing a lamb in another world there is a bleeding lamb amen amen anybody that's why when john was asking for the kingsman redeemer who is worthy to take the book the lamb came out from the sanctuary as a bleeding lamb amen amen everybody okay let's go to first samuel chapter 16. if you dare you can say amen i'm gonna hurry so you can go home hallelujah first samuel chapter 16 the seven blending with the egg if you dare you can say amen amen verse 10 everybody there you there again jesse made how many children you okay now how many children did jesse have [Music] seven children let's go and jesse made seven of his sons to pass before samuel and samuel said unto jesse the lord has not chosen this [Music] amen am i reading a different bible [Music] how many children went by and seven none of them was chosen so which one is going to be chosen [Music] which one he's not there amen amen verse 11 and samuel said to unto jesse are they here all that children in other words is this all that you got and he said they remember yet not the oldest one it's a very short age amen it's not an older age very short age amen amen and uh and said and he said that we managed yet the youngest and behold he does what why is he keeping sheep why is he connected with sheep amen he keep his sheep and samuel say unto jesse sand and fetch him for we will not sit down till he comes water do you think somebody will sit down in the kingdom of god if the last elect is not there yet and he sent and brought him in and now he was rooting and without a beautiful countenance and goodly to look to look to and the lord say arise and do what so the anointing fell on which number everybody okay amen so the eighth was david anybody okay and this is where the anointing fell anybody okay let's go to first chronicle chapter 1 and i want you to argue with the bible whoever would like to argue with brother branham amen amen you dare you can say amen amen everybody there let's go to verse first chronicle one i'm sorry i hope i mean the correct verse give me one second and i will find it first chronicle two if you dare you can say amen verse 12. everybody there not yet you there and boast we know boazur is bigger too and obed begat who everybody okay and jesse begat his firstborn eliab everybody okay and abinadabda number two and sharmada third number three verse 14 nathaniel there number four red eye duh 15 aussie david why don't you argue with the scripture that there is a contradiction in the bible why don't you argue with the scripture that there is a contradiction in the bible david the water and david is the eighth anybody okay david the seventh by david the eighth amen you see now are the seven and the eighth blend together [Music] he's number seven but he's also number eight [Music] we are in the seven church ages under the seven message i with the seventh seal message but we are under eternity in the prodigy one person hallelujah amen seven ages seventh messenger seventh edge under the seventh trumpet seventh seal but eighth day that's why the revelation the seven still take you to revelation chapter 8 anybody okay because why because jubilee means grace misses the capstone is coming crying water on the eighth day on jubilee anybody here so there is a reason why he we gotta be a seven and the eighth anybody here there is a reason why we must be a seven and an eight a seven you can copy everybody else but the eighth is what makes you different did you get it i want to hide it till sunday so you get it everybody okay there is a reason why you must be seven then eight back here the seventh is david but the eighth is david when it comes to the king anointing the king anointing is placed on the eighth amen amen did i lose you did i lose anybody this bible got a seven but there is an eight amen this bible this is a seven it's completed it's the completed word of god but there is a nation here amen amen everybody okay amen everybody okay this is the seventh this is the complete revelation of jesus christ right here this is seven but here these seven paul can handle it the seven arenas can handle it the seven columba can handle it the seven luther can handle it the seven westlake can handle it this seven pentecostal can handle it baptists can handle it presbyterian can handle it denominational can handle it but the eighth it's only for the bride the eighth is not outside the seventh it is in the seventh but it's a portion that belongs to the bride everybody okay so far everybody okay so far there is a book of life and the lamb's book of life the book of life is completed but there is a section of the lamb's book of life that section is specific for eight amen amen amen everybody okay did i lose anybody everybody clear now that's why we have a jubilee amen anybody here amen that's why i can talk with you the bible but i can get into a different language amen that language is only on the 8th it's on revelation 8 with the opening of the 7th seal but when you open the language it's usually quiet it doesn't speak much he unfold the scripture in a different way he was muted because the lord rested that's why whatever happened on the sabbath of the land was the same requirement for the 50th day of jubilee you don't prune you don't sow on the fifth year death you don't do the same thing that you were doing on the sabbath day showing you that this is a hidden sabbath amen it is a sabbath that takes you into the millennium everybody okay amen amen we okay now amen we okay now amen if i ask you a question you will remember let's turn without revelation you will be stuck in david 7 and david 8 and i have many of them like that for people who want to argue i can sit down and say the bible says here this bible says here since it's contradiction and you are logical people why don't you reject the bible the bible is not meant for logical people the bible is not meant for people to reason it will blow your reasoning this is the word of god amen this reason is completely out it doesn't work like that the bible is meant to believe and the message was hidden in the scripture that's why the message would never contradict the scripture if you find you reading brother branham and you find that it's blocking with the scripture don't get to a conclusion leave it alone just keep praying keep praying keep praying and before you know it you will see either a brother that the lord will bring or maybe you yourself especially if you respect the prophet and you humble yourself then god will open up there is one court that i can give you that will contradict many courts but that quote is not contradicting it seems to be contradicting brother branham said god sometimes leaves stuff like that to get the people out of the message you hit that you go out but it's not contradicting the people and because of that court some people teach this way some other teach this way because that quote and if you go this way that court will contradict you if you go with this way the other court will contradict you [Music] how are you going to take both coats and put them together with that coat that's the problem and if you can't take your hand off respect the prophet say god i believe sometime in one year or two or three years you see the lord opening stuff and you say wow i have never seen this before who thought the candlestick were almond trees how many years have you read the scripture but in his time when it's the appropriate time he will open and he was right there and you wonder you say how can i be reading this over and over and i can't even find out [Music] because the prophet will always be zeroed in with the scripture especially this one who is greater from enoch all the way down the only one beyond him is the lord jesus christ you need the coach you see me amen the only one above brother branham his ministry is the lord jesus christ amen that's why his body have to be protected they say you you don't go to the nightclub you don't smoke you don't drink you don't do this because the work that we have to do here is a different candidate it's a different caliber of work you are responsible for the seals he requires something different amen he had the desire to do that but god block it because god wanted to do something amen we're not worshiping a man we are worshiping christ by christ to reveal himself through a man so that we will understand better description we thought jesus was standing and praying for the sick people he took brother branham to explain to us that that's nothing jesus was seeing vision that's why he says i do nothing except the father shows me we were reading that we thought because we were uh uh what bombarded by the pentecostal we thought he was doing the praying line praying for the people and god praying for the people and go that's not what he was doing amen it took a profit to demonstrate that then we begin to look we say okay now we understand why he said virtue have left me when we see brother brown i'm getting tired they have to pack him now we begin to understand jesus christ [Music] amen very simple ministry never complicated if you humble yourself you respect the office of the prophet you don't understand you say father i believe it you told me when a prophet speak and what he spoke happened all i have to do is to listen not to understand it you listen to him if the prophet says let's go to the left you go to the left because god already vindicated it amen because later on by the time you're understanding up and up you can find yourself in trouble but if you love your master so much if you love your master so much the key there is that when you were under a master the master gave you a wife you remember that scripture it was not the woman you came with [Music] because the woman you came with you chose her that was your wife but the one you were under you didn't choose her because matter of fact under that status you were a slave so they gave you a wife for you to produce more servant anybody okay amen but if you love that woman more than the trumpet of jubilee or if you love that master because he has been a good master for you for years for 50 years he never treated you wrong he even gave you a wife now you have children but if the jubilee sound no matter how good the master was amen you must esteem the trumpet of jubilee beyond damascus in other words you can never esteem a preacher or a pastor in this message beyond the message of the hour hallelujah amen no matter how good the pastor is the message is the top amen amen anybody here you're not supposed to fall in love with the prophet you're not supposed to fall in love with your master you're supposed to fall in love with the deliverer who knew that one day you're gonna get in trouble and he prepared a trumpet of jubilee to deliver you when you get in that state and now he's sending the trumpet but you fall in love with somebody who has been slaving you [Music] you even forsake you you you you even forgot the sense of what liberty is you got comfortable with bondage [Music] you got comfortable with slavery when they say you come here and then you see people obeying that and after a while they begin to obey that that's why paul told the galatian you say if somebody slap you you will believe him it's written in this bible it's in second uh corinthians chapter 11 if i'm not mistaken paul say if somebody slap you you're gonna understand that if i come and say hey you don't have to kill nothing you see that's strange because you got used to pharisee and sadducee you must have a lamb but you've been doing this lamb for years look at what happened to you nothing changed in your life and god is giving you a word of deliverance to free you but it's like johnny the crow he got so used to the bandage until he loved the bandage he's comfortable with the bandage he loves credit cards [Music] you need another jubilee from credit card amen amen i don't know where that job from you need another jubilee from debt anybody here we got comfortable and before you know it you hook back here and you have a hard time coming off amen and that master will keep you out of church he will keep you out of church on wednesday he will keep you out of church on sunday he will keep you out of everything that belonged to church so you can continue to serve him and the more you serve him they give you a prize you and you are the employee of the mountain and then they raise your salary and they keep you more outside the church and then you keep going outside the church and then three years one month three months four months nobody goes to church no we're streaming but stephen i'm streaming i'm streaming another master is working but there is a trumpet that comes to free the bride amen you stream so much until you don't understand the benefit of being inside the building you lost it you lost it you don't value that anymore i don't know where that came from but whoever is streaming search your life come off some bondage don't continue to put yourself under under under under under no no my boss loved me so much he said if you don't work on sunday we'll be fine we gotta do this delivery you're the one on sunday you're the one on sunday and the muslim that work with you doesn't want to work when he has to go to the mosque but you the only one that always your cows goes into the pit now he doesn't go in the pit he stays on the pit forever anybody here free yourself i don't know where that job from but be careful you want to be free you want to go home enjoy sunday enjoy wednesday enjoy the blessings of the lord enjoy the question and answer and enjoy everything that the lord have for you the full benefit don't be caught up with this life that you stay under a long time ago until the condom because the more you stay under that life brother branham said the condemnation goes away because god condemned you condemn you condemn you after a while the condemnation won't work anymore now you begin to find it normal you went one year in 2020 you've never been on sunday on wednesday service for the whole 2020 and you still think you normal in 2021 you never been on service for the whole wednesday you think it's normal it is not normal it is not normal 20 question and answer you never been in one you fine it doesn't bother you a bit something is wrong wake up god want to free you that master will continue to plug you in plug you in now the gas price is up now the houses are up everything up so now you begin to even be more afraid to lose the job before than what you were before now you're looking if i lose i'm going to lose everything yeah that's the devil he's going to increase it more but why are we keep coming to church we're on the same category my god also is higher matter of fact i use more than you but because you give him the preeminence when you're in the jubilee he will give some increase [Music] everybody okay and before you know it somebody got a promotion and before you know it somebody got this somebody got this because you valuing the jubilee let's pray heavenly father lord we are approaching you again humbly tonight father thanking you for your grace for your love for your mercy father and for everything you have been doing for us father this subject of jubilee it's a great subject it is greater than even one hour of preaching it is so deep and it's so rich it is not just the jubilee to free us from sin but it goes to many aspects of our lives it is a jubilee is sabbath that affect everything in our life it affects our children it brings meat to everybody no wonder peter on the day of pentecost could say that the promise is unto you unto your children that's why moses in the old testament could save meat for your high servant for this for this for this because it was a promise that was reaching out all area in our life because you want us to be prospered prosper in every aspect of our life and not being in bondage to anything lord father solomon was even astonished when he saw princes walking and servant riding lord father on horses but lord you are bringing the revelation that we are the children of the king and father what great thing can you do but to send your word like you sent this message to free us from every single aspect of our life and the devil have attacked trying to belittle the message try to bring confusion around the message but father you rose a different anointing that is bringing the message more clear and clear and planar and planar to your children because your prophet said that when you open the word more planet it's for your children to grasp it to take it and to suck it pretty good that there won't be any more confusion lord father free this
