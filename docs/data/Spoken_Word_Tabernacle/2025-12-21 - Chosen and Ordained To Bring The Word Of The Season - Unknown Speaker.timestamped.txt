[0:07] [music]
[0:22] You did good, my friend.
[0:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[0:26] &gt;&gt; Last Sunday, let's pick up this and we
[0:28] move on. WE FIND THAT JESUS SAY IN JOHN
[0:31] 15 that ye have what?
[0:33] &gt;&gt; Not chosen me.
[0:34] &gt;&gt; But what happened?
[0:35] &gt;&gt; I have chosen you
[0:36] &gt;&gt; and did what?
[0:36] &gt;&gt; Ordained you.
[0:37] &gt;&gt; So Jesus chosen us.
[0:40] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[0:41] &gt;&gt; And did what?
[0:42] &gt;&gt; Ordained us.
[0:42] &gt;&gt; And ordained us.
[0:45] &gt;&gt; Ordained us to do what?
[0:47] &gt;&gt; That you should bring forth fruit.
[0:49] &gt;&gt; That we should bring forth what?
[0:50] &gt;&gt; Fruit.
[0:51] &gt;&gt; We should bring forth fruit. And that
[0:53] what happened?
[0:53] &gt;&gt; Your fruit should remain.
[0:55] &gt;&gt; So we were all chosen.
[0:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[0:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. Number one,
[0:59] &gt;&gt; and orained,
[1:01] &gt;&gt; PREDESTINATED,
[1:04] &gt;&gt; FABRICATED,
[1:05] &gt;&gt; PREPARE.
[1:07] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:08] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:08] &gt;&gt; TO BRING FORTH WHAT?
[1:10] &gt;&gt; FRUIT.
[1:10] &gt;&gt; IF YOU LOOK, THAT FRUIT IS NOT PLURAL.
[1:13] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[1:15] &gt;&gt; Verify in your Bible.
[1:17] &gt;&gt; It is a fruit in the singular.
[1:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21] &gt;&gt; AND WE KNOW THAT FRUIT ARE USUALLY IN
[1:24] THE SEED. AMEN.
[1:28] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[1:29] &gt;&gt; WHEN WHEN YOU TAKE AN APPLE seed
[1:31] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.
[1:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33] &gt;&gt; And you and you plant it, it is not the
[1:35] water that bring the apple.
[1:38] &gt;&gt; Every apple is already in the seed.
[1:42] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:43] &gt;&gt; SO YOUR PREDESTINATED SEED HAS A FRUIT.
[1:49] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:49] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. And this fruit JESUS SAY AND THAT
[1:53] YOUR FRUIT SHOULD DO WHAT?
[1:55] &gt;&gt; REMAIN.
[1:55] &gt;&gt; SO THIS IS NOT A FRUIT THAT CAN BE
[1:58] DESTROYED.
[1:58] &gt;&gt; NO SIR.
[1:59] &gt;&gt; IT IS AN ETERNAL FRUIT.
[2:03] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:04] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:04] &gt;&gt; AND JESUS CONTINUE. HE SAYS WHAT?
[2:07] &gt;&gt; That whatsoever ye shall ask.
[2:08] &gt;&gt; In other word WHEN YOU BRING FORTH fruit
[2:13] &gt;&gt; a fruit that REMAIN
[2:15] &gt;&gt; ONCE THAT FRUIT IS MANIFESTED IN YOUR
[2:18] LIFE. WHATSOEVER YOU ASK,
[2:21] &gt;&gt; take your time right there.
[2:23] &gt;&gt; Take your time right there.
[2:27] &gt;&gt; THERE WILL BE A TIME IN YOUR LIFE YOU
[2:29] COULD NOT BRING THE FRUIT
[2:30] &gt;&gt; BUT THE FRUIT WAS IN YOU.
[2:33] &gt;&gt; AT THAT TIME WHEN YOU ASK GOD, GOD
[2:35] DOESN'T KNOW WHAT TO GIVE YOU ALL THE
[2:37] TIME
[2:38] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE YOU ARE NOT FULLY CONVERTED TO
[2:40] HIM YET.
[2:41] &gt;&gt; THERE IS TIME.
[2:43] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER?
[2:44] &gt;&gt; BUT WHEN YOU MANIFESTED THE FRUIT,
[2:47] &gt;&gt; COME ON NOW LORD. AMEN.
[2:49] &gt;&gt; WHEN YOU BRING FORTH THE FRUIT,
[2:51] &gt;&gt; GOD IS A 100%
[2:54] &gt;&gt; SURE THAT THIS ONE WILL GO NOWHERE.
[2:57] &gt;&gt; YES SIR. [cheering]
[3:01] &gt;&gt; IN OTHER WORDS, YOU WERE MANIFESTED WHAT
[3:04] YOU WERE SET FOR.
[3:06] &gt;&gt; YES SIR.
[3:08] &gt;&gt; IN OTHER WORDS, YOU BECOME THE
[3:10] [screaming] WORD.
[3:15] BECAUSE EVERY SEED MUST BE REPRODUCED
[3:19] ACCORDING TO ITS OWN KIND.
[3:21] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[3:22] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE YOU SHALL KNOW THEM BY THEIR
[3:24] FRUIT.
[3:25] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[3:26] &gt;&gt; SO WHEN YOUR TRUE IDENTITY IS
[3:28] MANIFESTED,
[3:30] &gt;&gt; GOD HAVE NO PROBLEM WITH YOUR
[3:32] CONFIDENCE.
[3:35] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[3:38] &gt;&gt; When God was giving Peter the keys,
[3:42] &gt;&gt; he knew the weakness OF PETER.
[3:45] BUT HE DIDN'T CARE ABOUT THE WEAKNESS
[3:48] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE HE KNEW PETER WILL ALWAYS COME
[3:50] BACK.
[3:54] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER?
[3:56] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER?
[3:57] &gt;&gt; THAT WILL NOT CHANGE GOD'S DECISION.
[4:00] &gt;&gt; SO ONCE YOU REACH THE POINT THAT YOU
[4:03] HAVE REPRODUCED,
[4:05] &gt;&gt; MANIFESTED
[4:06] THE FRUIT OF GOD.
[4:08] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[4:10] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? THEN FROM THAT POINT
[4:13] WHATSOEVER.

[11:55] &gt;&gt; YOU SHALL RECEIVE IT. YOU ARE COMING IN
[11:58] HIS NAME. [applause]
[12:00] [cheering]
[12:01] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together.
[12:06] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together.
[12:07] &gt;&gt; AMEN. I HOPE WE ARE TOGETHER.
[12:09] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[12:09] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE JESUS CHOSE YOU
[12:12] &gt;&gt; AND ORDAINED YOU.
[12:14] &gt;&gt; THEREFORE, YOU CAN USE HIS NAME.
[12:19] [cheering]
[12:20] &gt;&gt; HE HAS CONFIDENCE.
[12:26] [applause]
[12:26] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[12:27] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[12:29] &gt;&gt; HE SAYS IF YOU ASK WHATSOEVER YOU ASK
[12:31] THE FATHER WHY
[12:32] &gt;&gt; IN MY NAME
[12:33] &gt;&gt; I WILL DO WHAT?
[12:34] &gt;&gt; He may give it to you.
[12:35] &gt;&gt; He will get HE MAY GIVE. GOD WILL GIVE
[12:37] IT TO YOU.
[12:38] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? WHY? BECAUSE
[12:40] [screaming] GOD CHOSE you
[12:42] &gt;&gt; and God ordained you.
[12:44] &gt;&gt; AND WE FOUND OUT THAT CHOOSING SOME
[12:47] PEOPLE ARE CHOSEN.
[12:48] &gt;&gt; YES, THEY ARE.
[12:49] &gt;&gt; BUT NOT TO BRING FRUIT.
[12:55] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER?
[12:56] &gt;&gt; WE FOUND JUDAS WAS CHOSEN.
[12:59] &gt;&gt; HE WAS CHOSEN AMONG THE 12.
[13:02] &gt;&gt; BUT HE WAS A DEVIL.
[13:05] ARE WE TOGETHER?
[13:06] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE HE WAS THE SON OF
[13:08] &gt;&gt; PREDITION.
[13:10] &gt;&gt; HE CANNOT CALL GOD HIS FATHER.
[13:12] &gt;&gt; NO SIR.
[13:14] &gt;&gt; NO SIR.
[13:14] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE HE CAME FROM HELL.
[13:16] &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT.
[13:16] &gt;&gt; PREDITION means hell.
[13:18] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER?
[13:19] &gt;&gt; AND JESUS SAID, "I CHOSE YOU ALL OF you
[13:22] &gt;&gt; but one of you is what?"
[13:24] &gt;&gt; That was in John 6.
[13:25] &gt;&gt; WE KNOW BY JOHN 13, JUDAH LEFT.
[13:28] &gt;&gt; And once Judah left, Jesus changed the
[13:30] language.
[13:31] &gt;&gt; He said, "Who staying here? There is no
[13:33] more child of the devil. They all gone
[13:36] from the message. Okay. Now I need to
[13:38] change the language. Now let me bring
[13:40] another ministry
[13:42] &gt;&gt; that WILL BEGIN TO UNFOLD TO THEM who
[13:44] they are.
[13:45] &gt;&gt; WHEN EVERYBODY WHEN THE PARASITES ARE
[13:47] GONE.
[13:48] &gt;&gt; YES SIR.
[13:50] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[13:51] &gt;&gt; He say you I have chosen you.
[13:54] &gt;&gt; I ALREADY CHOSE YOU THE FIRST TIME BUT
[13:55] THIS TIME I'M REVEALING TO you
[13:57] something. I chose you and I ordain YOU
[14:00] TO BRING FORTH FRUIT.
[14:04] ARE WE TOGETHER?
[14:05] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[14:05] &gt;&gt; WHAT IS THE FRUIT? BROTHER BRANDHAM SAY
[14:08] WHAT IS THE FRUIT? THE FRUIT IS WHAT?
[14:10] &gt;&gt; THE WORD.
[14:10] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THE WORD HAVE EVERYTHING.
[14:12] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[14:16] &gt;&gt; THE FRUIT OF THE SPIRIT ARE IN THE WORD.
[14:19] &gt;&gt; THE WORD.
[14:19] &gt;&gt; HE SAYS WHAT IS THE FRUIT IS WHAT?
[14:21] &gt;&gt; THE WORD.
[14:22] &gt;&gt; THE FRUIT FOR WHAT?
[14:24] &gt;&gt; THE SEASON.
[14:24] &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT JUST THE WORD. THE WORD OF THE
[14:27] SEASON.
[14:27] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[14:28] &gt;&gt; AH THAT IS WHAT IT IS. THE WHAT
[14:31] &gt;&gt; TEACHING. THE TEACHING OF WHAT?
[14:37] &gt;&gt; I didn't write this quote.
[14:42] &gt;&gt; Did brother Brandham say they're
[14:43] preaching?
[14:48] [cheering]
[14:49] &gt;&gt; Yeah. You saying that because you a
[14:51] teacher? Of course.
[14:54] &gt;&gt; Yeah. I DON'T HAVE TIME TO BE HUMBLE.
[14:56] HUMBLE. HUMBLE. Of course.
[14:58] &gt;&gt; There is a reason why I'M A TEACHER.
[15:00] BECAUSE SOMEBODY NEED TO HEAR THE
[15:02] TEACHING OF the season, THE TEACHING OF
[15:06] MALACHI 4, REVELATION 10, THE TEACHING
[15:10] OF THE MESSAGE.
[15:12] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE BROTHER BRANDHAM SAY YOU CANNOT
[15:14] HAVE FAITH CORRECTLY IF YOU ARE NOT
[15:17] CORRECTLY TAUGHT.
[15:20] &gt;&gt; AND BROTHER BRANDHAM SAY A CHURCH CAN
[15:23] NEVER GO HIGHER THAN THE TEACHING,
[15:26] &gt;&gt; NOT THE PREACHING, THE TEACHING OF IT
[15:29] PASTOR.
[15:34] THE TEACHING OF WATER
[15:37] &gt;&gt; of the season. THE TEACHING OF WHAT
[15:40] &gt;&gt; NOT ANY TYPE OF TEACHING.
[15:42] &gt;&gt; WE NEED TO see who YOUR TEACHING IS.
[15:44] YOUR TEACHING MUST BE ACCORDING TO
[15:46] MALACHI 4.
[15:50] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY WHEN WE TEACH WE SAY BROTHER
[15:52] SAY WE NEED TO KNOW WHERE YOUR TEACHING
[15:54] ARE COMING FROM.
[15:59] WE NEED TO KNOW THE ORIGIN OF THE
[16:00] TEACHING
[16:02] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE IT'S IMPORTANT TO PRODUCE THAT
[16:04] TEACHING.
[16:06] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[16:08] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[16:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[16:09] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[16:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[16:11] &gt;&gt; You were chosen and you were ordained to
[16:14] bring forth the fruit. In other words,
[16:16] to bring forth the word.
[16:18] &gt;&gt; That's exactly right.
[16:22] &gt;&gt; What I'm saying here,
[16:24] &gt;&gt; you see the message? Yeah.
[16:26] &gt;&gt; The message,
[16:27] &gt;&gt; the message should not struggle with
[16:29] you.
[16:32] &gt;&gt; The living of the message for you, it's
[16:34] automatic.
[16:38] &gt;&gt; Because you were ordained for it.
[16:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[16:44] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[16:45] &gt;&gt; If you a woman,
[16:46] &gt;&gt; do you when you are growing up, do you
[16:49] tell your body change to a woman?
[16:51] &gt;&gt; Change to a woman. Now it's time for you
[16:53] to see your your your sac. Remember body
[16:57] &gt;&gt; when you are even eating I mean whatever
[17:01] I mean fruit or whatever your body knows
[17:03] what it's doing
[17:04] &gt;&gt; because your body knows that this is a
[17:06] woman.
[17:09] &gt;&gt; You can become a man and your body still
[17:11] know that you a woman.
[17:17] &gt;&gt; Your body already know that you a woman.
[17:19] YOU WON'T CHEAT THAT BODY BECAUSE YOUR
[17:22] BODY WAS ORDAINED AND CHOSEN TO BE A
[17:25] WOMAN. YOU WERE ORDAINED AND CHOSEN TO
[17:29] BE THE BRIDE.
[17:31] &gt;&gt; IN OTHER WORDS, YOUR SOUL KNOWS WHO YOU
[17:34] ARE. [cheering]
[17:41] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[17:41] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? AMEN.
[17:42] &gt;&gt; YOU DON'T STRUGGLE WITH THE MESSAGE. YOU
[17:44] DON'T WRESTLE WITH THE MESSAGE.
[17:46] &gt;&gt; ARE we together?
[17:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[17:47] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[17:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. YOU MIGHT EVEN TRY AND A CERTAIN
[17:50] POINT YOU JUST LET GO BECAUSE IT'S NOT
[17:52] YOU LETTING YOU GO. NO, YOUR BODY is
[17:55] working.
[17:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. You were ordained and you were
[17:58] predestinated.
[18:00] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[18:01] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[18:02] &gt;&gt; BUT IF YOU NOTICE, JUDAH NEVER MADE IT
[18:04] TO THE PENTECOST.
[18:07] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[18:08] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[18:09] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER?
[18:10] &gt;&gt; HE NEVER MADE IT TO THE UPPER ROOM.
[18:13] &gt;&gt; HE DIED [screaming] WITHOUT THE HOLY
[18:15] GHOST.
[18:16] BUT YET HE SERVED GOD
[18:18] &gt;&gt; TO A CERTAIN POINT.
[18:23] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[18:24] &gt;&gt; THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN YOU AND OTHER
[18:26] PEOPLE, OTHER PEOPLE WILL SERVE GOD TO A
[18:30] CERTAIN POINT.
[18:36] [cheering]
[18:39] &gt;&gt; SOME SOME PEOPLE SERVE GOD WHEN THEY
[18:44] PLATEAU. THEY LEFT THE MESSAGE.
[18:47] &gt;&gt; SOME DON'T WANT TO LEAVE THE MESSAGE.
[18:49] &gt;&gt; THEY ARE STILL AROUND THE MESSAGE
[18:51] PEOPLE.
[18:52] &gt;&gt; BUT IF YOU GET ALONG WITH THEM, THEY
[18:54] DON'T PUSH.
[18:56] &gt;&gt; THEY CANNOT MOVE.
[18:59] &gt;&gt; THEY ALREADY PLATEAU.
[19:02] &gt;&gt; THEY ARE IN A RELIGIOUS MODE.
[19:07] &gt;&gt; THEY DON'T STRIVE TO SEE MORE GOD IN
[19:10] [screaming] THEIR LIVES.
[19:12] &gt;&gt; THEY ARE COMFORTABLE. [applause]
[19:19] ARE WE TOGETHER?
[19:20] &gt;&gt; Are we together SIR?
[19:22] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? SO SOME PEOPLE SERVE
[19:24] GOD TO A CERTAIN POINT
[19:26] &gt;&gt; BUT WHEN TO REACH THE CLIMATE THEY WILL
[19:29] NEVER REACH IT.
[19:31] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY THE BIBLE SAY HAVE WE NOW
[19:33] PROPHESY
[19:34] &gt;&gt; THEY WERE PROPHESYING.
[19:36] &gt;&gt; HAVE WE NOT CAST OUT DEVIL?
[19:38] &gt;&gt; THEY WERE CASTING OUT DEVIL. AND JESUS
[19:40] TURN SAY I NEVER KNEW YOU. AND THE
[19:43] PROPHECY IS THE SECOND POOL.
[19:45] &gt;&gt; CUZ THAT DEVIL IS THE FIRST POOL.
[19:48] &gt;&gt; BUT THE THIRD POOL, THEY CANNOT REACH
[19:50] IT.
[19:54] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[19:56] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER?
[19:57] &gt;&gt; SO AMONG [screaming] THE SERVANT OF GOD,
[20:00] AMONG THE DISCIPLE OF GOD, THERE ARE TWO
[20:03] CATEGORIES.
[20:05] &gt;&gt; THERE ARE SOME THAT WILL GO ALL THE WAY
[20:07] AND PRODUCE FRUIT.
[20:10] AMEN.
[20:13] &gt;&gt; AND THERE ARE SOME THAT WILL GO AT A
[20:15] CERTAIN LEVEL AND THEY BLOCK BECAUSE
[20:18] THEY WERE NOT ORDAINED.
[20:21] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[20:23] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY THIS MESSAGE IS NOT A GROUP
[20:26] REVELATION.
[20:27] &gt;&gt; IT IS AN INDIVIDUAL REVELATION.
[20:30] [cheering]
[20:31] &gt;&gt; WHEN GOD [screaming] OPEN UP, MOVE
[20:33] FORWARD.
[20:34] &gt;&gt; I DON'T KNOW WHO YOU ARE. I DON'T KNOW
[20:37] IF [screaming] YOU ARE ORDAINED TO
[20:39] PRODUCE WHAT GOD TOLD ME TO PRODUCE.
[20:43] [applause]
[20:47] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[20:49] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[20:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[20:50] &gt;&gt; Are we clear so far?
[20:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[20:52] &gt;&gt; We clear so far.
[20:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[20:53] &gt;&gt; Let's go to the parable of the mana
[20:57] &gt;&gt; of the panda.
