those two angels god judged her on the spot god didn't wait tomorrow as soon as she turned around judgment struck that was it do you know who you are let me help you now let's go on the other side elohim himself was with abraham everybody okay everybody okay everybody okay an elohim spoke not angels elohim spoke inhuman flesh and elohim says that sarah sarah another woman sarah your wife abraham will have a child next year here and sarah laughs she didn't life to angel she laughed to god himself do you know who you are why didn't god kill sarah lord wife one action um that's it but sarah laughs in other words she disbelieved god she sat there she said this one maybe he loved food so much he started talking like that me having a child and nothing happened to sarah can i make it worse can i make it worse then elohim saw sarah god himself and say sarah you laugh in the face of god sarah lies [Music] do you understand what i'm saying lord white just did this judgment sarah the second time lied to god in the face and god doesn't do anything why why what was in sarah that is blocking god and these are the woman one shot she's gone but sarah first time second time and god is still standing like he doesn't have the power [Music] sarah is not judged by her works [Music] you okay sarah is judged by who she is [Applause] [Music] she is the allah the wife of abraham with h.a.m seven letters my prophet there's nothing i can do is god unfair god forbid is god unjust do you know who you are that's why you heard brother keep saying all these years you could be dead you could be gone you could be lost you could be dead when you were dancing on the nightclub and if you are dead right there you will go to hell they put you on a ventilator you came out [Music] when you were smoking the devil was unable to kill you because if you are dead right there you go to hell but because of the unmerited the band of predestination [Music] [Applause] [Music] when you dancing in the nightclub god is quiet [Music] do you now know who you are you are more than what you think you are you are the bride of jesus christ and there is no way god is going to lose have you ever thought about god wrestling with moses moses i'm going to send you moses said no i don't know how to speak and god come and say no no no i already provided somebody with you go moses say okay but before i go no you need you got to show me i need to see who am i going gonna tell israel why is god doing everything moses wanted to do in other words it's like it's like god is begging moses gideon are you going there uh-uh i'm afraid okay god give somebody a vision explain to gideon gideon saying i'm still not of the uh convicted okay i'm gonna okay i'm gonna take this flea and put it here if water is there and water is not in the ground and the god say yes i'm gonna do it and kill your comeback again and say no no no let's make a difference put water all around and get why is god pleading he can just kill gideon and create another gideon and use it do you know what i'm saying because in the book of life there was only one gideon [Applause] [Music] and god doesn't have a plan to be on gideon there is only one gideon so he must do everything to convince that gideon [Music] you don't understand me but here if you send somebody else in egypt israel will not be delivered according to the book of life the one in the program of egypt is moses so whatever it takes to convince moses god must do it [Applause] [Music] do you see why he chased you because you have no option [Music] you tried to run he put sickness he put you on the hospital everybody say you die he doesn't let you die your sickness is to whoop you then he hit you back and say understand what i'm saying why he didn't kill you because you have a purpose to fulfill if the quicker you understand that he stopped all the whooping cough [Music] the quicker you understand that oh i was in a car wreck to die that was not dead so there is a language right there you don't understand no i'm not going to church i'm not going to church you run away from church he whoop you he whoop you whoop you you come back again to church but somebody else ran away and they never came back and god don't even care [Music] he have no option do you understand who you are you think i orchestrated to bring him here no it's not me it is him who's watching he says i need on the 24th brother keith from jamaica move on from there because my children are there he need to deliver them a message amen maybe brother keith was going somewhere else and god moved him differently do you understand me do you know that jesus was going to jerusalem and god moved him he said i must need to go back by why did he find a believer in samaria who did he fund in samaria a prostitute because she already have six husbands the seven one is time so god made sure before they crucified jesus that he deal with the prostitute because she was in the plan of redemption the quicker you understand that the quicker you start getting away from the things of the world like brother kev say and you begin to give him your life quickly and consecrate your time and stop foolishness the quicker you're gonna see say that's it that's all i was looking for now open the windows of heaven [Music] god have no other bride but you god have no other option what did he see in you to love you when there are people better than us the angel cannot understand that amen it is a matter of choice i might look back to you but to him i'm handsome anybody here you don't discuss that he it's his sovereign choice amen that's why boaz was locked and could not get married because the wife has to come from somewhere else he had money he had property all he needed was a wife but for some reason he's not getting married because his wife was predestinated until roof come then the revelation of marriage quickened into boaz clear my friend what a privilege do we have to take a minister a great elder in jamaica and move him out of here just for you to understand something do you know who you are do you understand who you are brother keith thank you very much we are humble amen amen don't look down at yourself don't look at this guy he will betray you look at the promised word of the hour amen what he says this is what you are can really sarah have a child yes sarah is gonna have a child me really going in the rupture one of this day you're gonna look at your hand and your hand will be new one of this day you're gonna turn around you say i'm not the person i used to be i remember in 2009 i was crying i was sobbing i was there desperate i say i'm not gonna give anybody any trust like this anymore where are you today if i ask you today if i tell you today do you you want to go back where we used to [Music] so what he had in the future by bringing you two trials it's always a better unexpected end he knows what he's doing no matter what you're going through he knows he's regulating the temperature he's not going to burn you you understand his language quickly he turned the oven off here anybody here you understand what he's telling you quickly the quicker you surrender your life he turned the oven off you got the problem anybody here he have no choice he have no alternative he will chase you you took a decision i'm gonna leave the church i'm going to leave this message you go there is no happiness you go there is no disappointment you look at somebody else they happy but you're not happy because you were programmed not to be happy over there your
