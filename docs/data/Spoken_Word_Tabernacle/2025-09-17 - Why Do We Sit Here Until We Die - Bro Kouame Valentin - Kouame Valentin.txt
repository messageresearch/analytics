I I thought I can dig deeper, but what the way the Holy Spirit is opening it right now, I don't know. We will take these two series and I have to take my time because we need to dig into the root and begin to go back up again all the way. The young man's the young sisters are already well prepared. But this is the people who are already in the marriage for years. &gt;&gt; Amen.

You got to get into it and root everything out. Amen. I'm not preaching tonight. Like I say, it's a convention. It's today is for brother Valentine. &gt;&gt; You know, brother Valentine, he been here. He can even preach in English. But if he preach in English, it takes a little bit of time. So I want him to be free to flow the the anointing really easily. So I will be translating. So brother Valentine also is a pastor from Maverick Coast. They usually travel together with brother Paul. You know him. If you don't know him, all it takes is five minute and then you would know who you're dealing with because they take off too quick. Amen. They take off too quick.

So let's go to the main thing. So let's go straight to the word. It's it will be a lengthy reading. I'm going to read in second king chapter 7. &gt;&gt; So, brother Steven, you go ahead and read it in English. &gt;&gt; The whole chapter. So, the whole chapter of second king chapter 7. Second king chapter 7. If you dare, you can say, "Amen." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All right. Then Elisha said, "Hear ye the word of the Lord. Thus sayaith the Lord, tomorrow about this time shall a measure of fine flour be sold for a shekele, and two measures of barley for a shekele in the gate of Samaria." Then a lord on whose hand the king lean answered the man of God and said, "Behold, if the Lord will make windows of in in heaven, might this thing be?" And he said, "Behold, thou shalt see it with thine eyes, but thou shalt not eat thereof." And there were four lepous men at the entering in the in of the gate. And they said one to another, why sit we here until we die? If we say we will enter into the city, then the famine is in the city, and we shall die there. And if we sit still here, we die also. Now therefore come and let us fall unto the host of the Syrians. And if they save us alive, we shall leave, and if they kill us, we shall but die. And they rose up in the twilight to go unto the camp of the Syrians. And when they were come to the uttermost part of the camp of Syrian, behold, there was no man there. For the Lord has made the host of the Syrian to hear a noise of chariots and a noise of horses, even the noise of a great host. And they say one to another, "Lo, the king of Israel has hired against us the kings of the high and the kings of the Egyptian to come upon us." Wherefore they rose and fled into in the twilight and left their tents and their horses and their asses, even the camp as it was, and fled for their life. And when these lepers came to the uttermost part of the camp, they went into one tent and did eat and drink and carried them silver and gold and remnant and went and hid it and came again and enter into another tent and carried them also and went and hid it. Then they say one to another, "We do not well. This day is a day of a good of good tidings and we hold our peace. If we tar it till the morning light, some mischief will come upon us. Now therefore, come that we may go and tell the king's household. So they came and called unto the porter of the city. And they told them, saying, We came to the camp of Syrian of the Syrians. And behold, there was no man there, neither voice me voice of a man, but horses tied and asses tied and tent as they were. And he told and he called the porters and they told it to the king's house within. And the king arose in the night and said unto his servant, I will now show you what the Syrian have done to us. They know that we be hungry. Therefore are they gone out of the camp to hide themselves in the field, saying, when they come out of the city, we shall catch them alive and get into the city. And one of his servant answer and say, let some take a pray thee five of the horses that remain which are left in the city. Behold, they are as all the multitude of Israel that are left in them. Behold, I say they are even as all the multitude of Israel that are consumed, and let us send and see. They took therefore two chariot two horses, two chariot horses, and the king sent after the host of the Syrians, saying, "Go and see." And they went after them unto Jordan. And lo, all the way was full of garments &gt;&gt; and vessels, &gt;&gt; you may be seated, &gt;&gt; which the Syrian has cast away in their haste. And the messengers returned and told the king. And the people went out and spoiled the tent of the Syrian. So a measure of fan flour flour was sold for shekel. And two measures of barley for shekele according to the word of the Lord. And the king appointed the Lord on whose hand he lean to have the charge of the gate. And the people throtten throd upon him in the gate. And he died as the man of God have said, who spake when the king came down in him? Came came down to him. And it came to pass as the man of God had spoken to the king, saying, "Two measures of barley for a shekel, and a measure of fine flour for a shekel shall be tomorrow about this time in the gate of Samaria." And that Lord answered the man of God, and saying, Now, behold, if the Lord should make windows in heaven, must such a thing be. And he said, Behold, thou shalt see it with thine eyes, but shall not eat thereof. And so he fell out unto him, for the people throwed upon him in the gate, and he died. I'm going to read few verses.
