[39:14] everything prepared and put together and
[39:16] it didn't work out that way and uh I I
[39:19] was you you just learn to depend on the
[39:22] Lord you know and and so when I got here
[39:25] I was in back and I open my bible and
[39:28] there was the note I've been looking for
[39:30] and so I know the Lord just is a great
[39:34] provider you know
[39:37] friends we have not followed cunningly
[39:40] devised
[39:42] fables and God is in control of
[39:46] everything I was telling brother Stephen
[39:50] that um good to see you brother and uh
[39:54] just we just returned last Wednesday
[39:56] from a a two- week trip my wife and I
[39:58] were I had the time off of work and we
[40:01] went up to Michigan and we saw her
[40:03] grandmother and uh then we went down
[40:06] through Indiana and from there through
[40:08] the city of St Louis Missouri and
[40:11] there's a national there's a United
[40:12] States national landmark in St Louis
[40:16] Missouri it's called the arch some of
[40:19] you may be familiar with it I've never
[40:21] seen it before and uh so I when I
[40:23] realized our route was taking us through
[40:25] there I thought I'd i' like to see that
[40:27] so the it just worked out where the room
[40:31] the hotel we got uh out the window had a
[40:33] view of it and uh I never really read up
[40:37] on it so I just I found something and
[40:39] and it said that that um Monument or
[40:42] that that structure was built by an
[40:44] Italian
[40:46] man uh who was the architect the
[40:49] designer and oversaw its construction
[40:52] and it said he began the construction of
[40:55] it in February of
[40:59] 1963 and completed it in October of
[41:05] 1965 and they call it the Gateway to the
[41:11] West God God makes everything
[41:16] testify to what he's doing no you know
[41:18] no nobody nobody coordinated that but
[41:21] but God Amen so uh I'm thank God we
[41:25] we're not stopping in the west we're
[41:27] going back to Eternity amen and so uh
[41:30] it's a wonderful privilege just to to be
[41:33] a part of what God is doing in this hour
[41:36] so I'd like to invite you to turn with
[41:38] me tonight to your uh Matthew Chapter 2
[41:41] your Bibles and uh this this actually

[42:05] the Lord on Sunday morning and these
[42:07] things started coming to me so I'm
[42:08] sitting there trying to listen to and
[42:10] preach and writing a few notes of the
[42:12] things he was saying but a lot was
[42:14] coming by inspiration by the holy spirit
[42:16] for tonight's service so I pray the Lord
[42:19] will just speak tonight and uh give
[42:21] utterance and um Minister and and meet
[42:25] the needs let's go to him in prayer if
[42:26] you will and if you have something

[42:34] a way maker Heavenly Father Lord Every
[42:37] Time We Gather Lord we're blessed
[42:40] because you said if even two or three of
[42:41] us would Gather in your name that you
[42:44] would be here and Lord we know that you
[42:46] are present tonight to break the bread
[42:49] of life to our hearts and so we ask you
[42:51] now Lord to move the flesh aside move me
[42:55] aside take my thoughts and my heart and
[42:59] all that I am into your complete control
[43:02] that you may speak tonight and that your
[43:05] word may go in power and demonstration
[43:08] Lord to drive the enemy out to drive
[43:11] away doubt and fear and Lord to open our
[43:16] understanding Lord make the word live to
[43:18] us like you did when you walked along
[43:21] the Emmas road with your disciples after
[43:25] your Resurrection
[43:26] and we thank you tonight Lord to know
[43:28] that you're not a baby in a Manger
[43:31] you're not a man walking the shores of
[43:33] Galilee Lord you're not a a a character
[43:37] from The a historical Bible but you are
[43:40] alive you are resurrected tonight you
[43:43] are expressing yourself in the revealed
[43:46] word of the hour which has found a
[43:49] resting place in the hearts of your
[43:52] redeemed body the Bride of Jesus Christ
[43:56] and we're Gathering where the carcass is
[43:58] the Eagles will be gathered together so
[44:01] we're gathering around that tonight Lord

[44:07] to it father God that we can become the
[44:11] living expression of who you are in the
[44:13] earth today and in that in doing that
[44:15] Lord you will displace the enemy and
[44:18] every sickness disease uh every thought
[44:22] every anxiety whatever the enemy would
[44:24] try to use to bind your children father
[44:28] will be broken when the Jubilee trumpet
[44:31] is sounded father God the captives will
[44:33] go back home Lord back to the
[44:36] inheritance and may that happen tonight
[44:38] we know your Prophet said the preaching
[44:39] of the Gospel is the Jubilee trumpet to
[44:42] the believer so we ask you Lord now
[44:44] bless the reading of your word and guide
[44:46] the further part of the service we ask
[44:48] in Jesus name amen amen I just want to
[44:52] say too I really enjoyed that special
[44:54] I've heard that song many times times
[44:56] but never like that and so I believe the
[44:58] Lord just dropped in and and uh just
[45:01] inspired that and blessed that tonight
[45:03] so everything that's been done we just
[45:05] thank the Lord for it Matthew Chapter 2
[45:09] we'll read here beginning at verse one
[45:11] uh down through um I guess it would be
[45:15] verse number 12 now when Jesus was born
[45:18] in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of
[45:20] Herod the king behold there came wise
[45:24] men from the East
[45:26] to Jerusalem saying where is he that is
[45:30] born King of the Jews for we have seen
[45:34] his star in the east and are come to
[45:38] worship him when Herod the king had
[45:41] heard these things he was troubled and
[45:43] all Jerusalem with him and when he had
[45:45] gathered all the chief priests and
[45:47] scribes of the people together he
[45:49] demanded of them where Christ should be
[45:52] born and they said unto him in Bethlehem
[45:56] of Judea yes for thus it is written by
[46:00] the prophet and thou Bethlehem in the
[46:02] land of Judah art not the least among
[46:05] the princes of Judah for out of thee
[46:08] shall come a capital g
[46:10] governor that shall rule My
[46:14] People Israel so what you're seeing here
[46:17] is the um the contrast of two
[46:21] kingdoms
[46:23] sir and the superior Kingdom is emerging
[46:27] to rise to preeminence amen so uh in
[46:32] verse 7 it says then Herod when he had
[46:33] privately called the wise men inquired
[46:36] of them diligently what time the star
[46:39] appeared because it had been years right
[46:42] these wise men had been journeying now
[46:44] for years and when they um and he sent
[46:49] them he sent them to Bethlehem and said
[46:52] go and search diligently for the young
[46:55] child
[46:56] and when ye have found him bring me word
[47:00] again that I may come and worship him
[47:03] also when they heard the king when they
[47:07] had heard the king they departed and lo
[47:10] the star which they saw in the East went
[47:14] before them till it came and stood over
[47:19] where the young child was when they saw
[47:23] the star they rejoiced with exceeding
[47:26] great joy because what it we and we make
[47:28] it into it but what it actually happened
[47:30] the star disappeared it when they
[47:33] entered the capital that the religious
[47:35] Capital the walled City Star vanished so
[47:39] then they had to consult the word which
[47:42] said you got to go to Bethlehem and when
[47:45] they exited the gates of the city the
[47:47] star
[47:48] reappeared amen they rejoiced with
[47:50] exceeding great joy and when they were
[47:52] come into the house oh brother
[47:56] amen he was now in a house a Dwelling
[48:00] Place when they were come into the house
[48:03] they saw the young child with Mary his
[48:06] mother and fell down and worshiped him
[48:08] and when they had opened their Treasures
[48:11] they presented unto him Gifts of gold
[48:14] and frankincense and myrr and being
[48:17] warned of God in a dream that they
[48:20] should not return to Herod they departed
[48:23] into their own country another way may
[48:26] the Lord bless the reading of his word
[48:28] there's so much here
[48:30] amen and brother shimbo brother Stephen
[48:33] is a teacher and I'm sure he's realizing
[48:36] this is probably months worth of sermon
[48:39] material here but um um let's just go
[48:43] through this tonight and ask the Lord to
[48:45] Quicken something that would help us
[48:47] amen because I I believe something that
[48:50] was happening here with these wise men
[48:53] uh we can understand and relate to it
[48:56] today because we have had a very similar
[48:59] experience amen and so we realize that
[49:03] that that for this to happen there had
[49:05] to be a shift yes sir in the heavens yes
[49:09] sir amen these these these were these
[49:12] men were um astrologers if you will or
[49:15] astronomists who studied the heavens
[49:18] watching how the stars and all those
[49:20] heavenly Majestic bodies would move and
[49:24] shift around and and it all said
[49:26] something but but they knew when this
[49:28] shift happened it was an indication that
[49:32] something had happened in the earth yes
[49:35] my brother amen now I want you to think
[49:38] uh 2,000 years ago and then about 50 to
[49:41] 60 years ago yes things happening in the
[49:45] heavens were an indication that
[49:47] something had happened on the earth yes
[49:50] my brother amen so it signaled them
[49:53] Christ is born yes my brother yes he has
[49:58] come to Earth amen amen The Dwelling
[50:01] Place of the Messiah amen now it's not a
[50:05] prophecy now it's not a promise now it's
[50:08] not something out in the future now it's
[50:10] fulfilled amen and so when that
[50:14] realization struck them brother amen
[50:17] then they realized it's time to leave
[50:19] where we were that's exactly right and
[50:22] go to where he is yes my brother yes my
[50:26] yes amen wherever you were when you
[50:29] realize something has signaled me I've
[50:32] got to leave where I am and go to where
[50:35] he is amen then they began the journey
[50:38] they loaded up the camels and they
[50:40] loaded up the gifts and they got all the
[50:42] provisions together and they begin to
[50:44] make this journey amen and when when
[50:48] this happens and you're pulling this way
[50:50] you know the the Bible speaks in Genesis
[50:52] of a journey that Mrs Adam made from
[50:56] when she was formed from the dust to
[50:59] return to the side that she was formed
[51:02] from amen so she began a journey back to
[51:05] where she came from and so these men
[51:08] were were taking a journey but they were
[51:11] following a star and mean they were
[51:14] following something that was once maybe
[51:17] a part of a greater lights yes my
[51:20] brother but had been separated but was
[51:23] testifying sir that a greater light is
[51:26] present that's right a greater light is
[51:29] shining but you'll never find the
[51:31] greater light without following the
[51:33] star and the star represents a messenger
[51:38] to testify that there is greater
[51:42] lights greater light than Luther had
[51:45] greater light than Wesley had greater
[51:47] light than Pentecost greater light than
[51:50] the restoration of the gifts amen amen
[51:52] there's a greater Light present but
[51:54] you'll never find the greater light
[51:57] without the
[51:58] star amen so the star is there to lead
[52:02] you to the greater light or to the
[52:05] source of where his light is coming
[52:09] from amen and so the star amen from the
[52:14] distance from where they were seeing it
[52:16] the star was indicating to them he's in
[52:18] the proximity
[52:21] that's of
[52:23] Jerusalem he's in the proximity
[52:25] of the religious Capital amen where they
[52:28] were looking for a messiah where they
[52:31] had constructed everything to prepare
[52:34] for the arrival of the Messiah the god
[52:36] of Moses the god of Abraham the god of
[52:39] Jacob amen the god of Isaac amen but
[52:42] when the star was born he wasn't born in
[52:46] the wal City he wasn't born in the
[52:50] denomination mean he wasn't born in the
[52:53] thing that they had constructed with
[52:55] without a true revelation of what his
[52:58] arrival where his arrival would be amen
[53:00] right he was next to it amen just like
[53:04] Christ being placed outside of his own
[53:09] church if you're looking for him in
[53:11] leoda he's not there if you're looking
[53:14] for him in the denominations he's not
[53:17] there they built something Amen to
[53:20] prepare for his arrival but without
[53:23] Revelation amen they missed the
[53:26] mark amen and they denominated and he
[53:30] wasn't there that's right amen so as as
[53:35] I spoke earlier they were there they go
[53:37] into the City and so then they ask they
[53:41] begin asking right where is he that is
[53:43] born King of the Jews we've seen his
[53:45] star in the east we've come to worship
[53:47] him so this news reaches the current or
[53:50] the present
[53:52] King and he goes another
[53:58] King another
[54:01] leader oh my what is happening so he you
[54:03] know he has a keen interest and and who
[54:07] is who is this Rising King and so we as
[54:11] we read uh they they they they went then
[54:13] go to the chief priests and the scribes
[54:15] and they say well according to the word
[54:17] right he'll be born in Bethlehem that's
[54:20] it he's not even going to be born here
[54:23] or raised here or housed here
[54:26] and so when when uh I wrote this down
[54:30] when they had found the
[54:32] headquarters they were still looking for
[54:35] him that's exactly
[54:39] right they found what was supposed to be
[54:43] the source or the seat or the throne
[54:47] right but they realized he is not
[54:51] here that's it there was a lot going on
[54:55] in Jerusalem that's right but he wasn't
[54:58] there that's exactly right there were
[55:01] monuments there were temples there were
[55:04] sacrifices there was worship there was
[55:08] all kinds of religious things being
[55:10] taken place but he wasn't there that's
[55:13] right how about today brothers and
[55:16] sisters because I'm titling this worship
[55:20] by true
[55:24] revelation amen there's worship going on
[55:27] but without Revelation it is in vain
[55:30] that's exactly right it is a form that's
[55:32] right it is a fashion it it's a Creed
[55:35] it's a dogma mean it may stimulate
[55:37] emotion but he's missing that's right
[55:40] and that's what they realized when they
[55:42] got there we see the city we see the
[55:44] walls we see the history we see the the
[55:48] we've got the Scrolls here we've got the
[55:51] words of the prophets but we don't have
[55:54] the god
[55:57] right how about it amen yes sir sounds
[56:00] like the sons of the Prophet right amen
[56:02] they they they they might have had the
[56:04] relics they might have had the robes
[56:06] they might have had this they might have
[56:08] had the history they might as you know
[56:10] we we used to follow Elijah but when
[56:12] Elisha went back down to the Jordan he
[56:14] wasn't asking where Elijah was he said
[56:17] where is the god of Elijah amen and the
[56:20] god of Elijah was with Elisha amen amen
[56:24] amen he had moved amen from from a groom
[56:28] into bride form he had moved from alpha
[56:31] to Omega if you will amen oh brother and
[56:34] sister so when they they they had found
[56:36] what was supposed to be the destination
[56:40] right and they got there and
[56:42] realized he wasn't there
[56:45] amen all of the relics were there all of
[56:48] all of the
[56:50] Sacred objects right were
[56:53] there but without
[56:58] him it's worthless
[57:01] right so when they consulted the word
[57:05] yes sir they realized he's in Bethlehem
[57:08] Judea when they Departed the wall City
[57:11] Jerusalem right the star reappeared
[57:14] that's
[57:15] it yes sir and I love it was it was so
[57:19] amazing to me how the scriptures said
[57:23] that when they heard the king they
[57:26] departed and lo the star which they saw
[57:29] in the East right went before them yes

[57:34] began to move that's
[57:36] it the star wasn't a stationary Star as
[57:40] it would seem to me but it was a movie
[57:43] that's exactly right it was leadership
[57:47] right right it was it was active right
[57:51] and friend when you really see this
[57:53] message uhhuh
[57:56] I don't want to be misunderstood when I
[57:58] say this but the children of Israel were
[58:00] not just following
[58:02] Moses they were following what Moses was
[58:06] following amen amen amen Moses was being
[58:11] led by the pillar of fire that's exactly
[58:14] he was being led by God in the form of
[58:16] the pillar of fire so when Moses left
[58:18] the scene the pillar of fire did
[58:21] not amen so a new leader rose up Joshua
[58:26] and they followed him as he followed the
[58:28] pillar of fire so amen we are we I'm not
[58:32] trying to disassociate us from the
[58:34] ministry of the
[58:36] Prophet amen but we are not fixated on
[58:40] the person the man the
[58:44] veil we are fixated and we we have been
[58:48] attract again just hold this in mind
[58:50] remember what I said the star leads you
[58:52] to his Source amen
[58:55] amen amen that's it and when you find
[58:58] that the star has done his job that's it
[59:03] the purpose of the star has been
[59:05] fulfilled amen when John introduced
[59:08] Christ John
[59:10] faded and he said follow
[59:12] him amen I'm not worthy to lose his
[59:16] shoes but there's one coming after me
[59:18] who's preferred before me he was the
[59:21] reason John had come there Amen to
[59:23] prepare their heart s for the appear the
[59:27] the the appearing the arrival of Christ
[59:30] amen so here the star reappears to lead
[59:34] them and then to stand over the place
[59:38] yes sir where he now
[59:41] is glory to God brother and sister this
[59:45] message has brought us to the place
[59:48] where Christ
[59:50] is where his abiding presence is the
[59:53] holiest of hly
[59:55] the Shina Glory a living God a living
[59:59] gospel a Living Word a power Amen to
[1:00:03] turn a a a dry dead Rod back into a
[1:00:06] buing fruit producing Church Hallelujah
[1:00:09] that's what this message has done
[1:00:11] brothers and sisters is it has brought
[1:00:14] us to a living reality amen of Christ
[1:00:18] presence here today Amen in his word and
[1:00:23] in his people people that's exactly
[1:00:26] right yes my brother yes sir and now yes
[1:00:31] my brother I know if you're listening or
[1:00:32] watching tonight you said no no no wait
[1:00:34] a minute brother Tim there was a
[1:00:38] movement emphasizing the presence of
[1:00:41] Christ in the peria movement well friend
[1:00:44] I'm going to tell you something with
[1:00:46] every false Doctrine or every out of
[1:00:50] balance out of balance every Dogma
[1:00:53] everything all all these these things
[1:00:55] we've dealt with down through the years
[1:00:56] and I could name them but it wouldn't
[1:00:57] help anything but let me tell you a a
[1:00:59] trick of a good farmer uhuh go ahead now
[1:01:02] he doesn't put a
[1:01:04] scarecrow next to a bunch of weeds no
[1:01:08] sir
[1:01:10] sir sir he puts a scarecrow next to the
[1:01:16] strawberries yes sir so the Scarecrow
[1:01:19] should not send you away from the
[1:01:22] powerful truth
[1:01:25] that is the reason there's a scarecrow
[1:01:27] there so there might have been a
[1:01:30] Doctrine about the presence of Christ
[1:01:31] and there might have been a Doctrine
[1:01:33] about this or that but there's a truth
[1:01:35] that's exactly right and that's the
[1:01:38] reason there's a counterfeit is because
[1:01:40] there's a truth there amen so I'm not
[1:01:42] going to let the counterfeit scare me
[1:01:44] away amen he is here he did not leave
[1:01:48] when the prophet left amen he left 2,000
[1:01:52] years ago but he said I'm coming back
[1:01:55] and he came back in the form of the
[1:01:57] pillar of fire and the 120 of them came
[1:02:01] out of the upper room and that was
[1:02:03] Christ on the earth in a redeemed body
[1:02:07] amen doing exactly what he had done
[1:02:11] before he ascended in a many membered
[1:02:13] form that's EXA and the same thing has
[1:02:16] happened today God didn't just send a
[1:02:19] prophet with a message the message
[1:02:22] remained and has come into the hearts
[1:02:24] and lives of the redeemed Sons and
[1:02:26] Daughters of God around the world and it
[1:02:29] did not turn them into Brites it turned
[1:02:31] them into the Bride of Jesus Christ his

[1:12:10] truth
[1:12:12] hallelujah oh brother sister amen I'm
[1:12:16] sure the world looking on that day Jesus
[1:12:18] stood there and said Thou Art Peter and
[1:12:19] Upon This Rock I'll build my church and
[1:12:21] they said oh my what kind of church is
[1:12:23] this going to be
[1:12:24] but the prophet of God taught us that
[1:12:26] the church wasn't built on Jesus the
[1:12:28] church certainly wasn't built on Peter
[1:12:31] it wasn't built on some rock or some HED
[1:12:33] ground there but it was on the
[1:12:35] revelation of who Jesus Christ is and he
[1:12:38] said upon this he said and thou art
[1:12:40] Peter and Upon This Rock I'll build my
[1:12:43] church and the Gates of
[1:12:48] Hell glory to God you ever thought about
[1:12:50] that for a second go ahead my brother

[1:13:09] see the the the
[1:13:11] entrance or the welcome yes sir the the
[1:13:15] the the segue if you will I think it's
[1:13:17] the modern word forth into hell is
[1:13:19] fighting
[1:13:22] right
[1:13:24] against the
[1:13:25] Revelation and it will conquer
[1:13:29] everyone that does not have the
[1:13:33] Revelation the Gates of Hell shall not
[1:13:38] Prevail against another
[1:13:42] entrance which is Christ the revelation
[1:13:46] of who he is to the individual is their
[1:13:51] entrance into him
[1:13:55] him or I might say
[1:13:58] back into
[1:14:00] him no man can come to me except my
[1:14:04] father draw him amen the son of man came
[1:14:08] to seek and save that which was
[1:14:13] lost Redemption means something that was

[1:23:33] followed his anointing that's EXA by a
[1:23:36] prophet that's exactly you say well wait
[1:23:39] a minute brother Tim Saul was the King
[1:23:42] Saul was anointed by
[1:23:45] Samuel the agency of a prophet right or
[1:23:49] the son of man Minister that's exactly
[1:23:51] right is the channel yes my brother
[1:23:55] through which the
[1:23:56] kingship or the Dominion God exactly
[1:23:59] right that is exactly right when I saw
[1:24:03] it I was sitting there Sunday I saw that
[1:24:06] yes sir amen yes sir and and it's and
[1:24:09] it's recognized amen by those with the
[1:24:12] prophetic capacity amen amen amen yes
[1:24:17] amen oh
[1:24:19] God that's why Simeon and Anna uhuh a
[1:24:23] prophet and prophetess uhhuh recognized
[1:24:27] yes sir when Mary brought him to the
[1:24:29] temple as a child that's exactly right
[1:24:32] they worshiped him as their Messiah as
[1:24:35] the Redeemer as their
[1:24:38] Resurrection Simon said now my soul can
[1:24:40] depart in peace because mine eyes have
[1:24:43] beheld the glory of God yes my brother
[1:24:47] Revelation yes sir caused him to worship
[1:24:50] amen a child that John had not even yet
[1:24:54] baptized yes my brother now if that

[1:25:00] Antichrist
[1:25:02] Jehovah yes sir that's exactly right
[1:25:06] amen if he wasn't God then then we got
[1:25:09] something out of order that's right when
[1:25:10] he was born and when he was wor but he
[1:25:12] was God the entire time am he was God
[1:25:16] the entire time yes my brother and
[1:25:19] Revelation produced the true worship
[1:25:22] amen
[1:25:23] amen amen yes my brother so that
[1:25:28] that that principle yes I'm just
[1:25:30] touching on this I I need to find a
[1:25:32] place to close it's the the king's
[1:25:36] ship is administered through the office
[1:25:39] or Ministry of a prophet yes my
[1:25:42] brother
[1:25:44] yes see even Saul uhhuh that's where he
[1:25:49] lost yes he lost his kingship right by
[1:25:53] failing to remain aligned with
[1:25:59] theet brother we've seen that
[1:26:03] happen
[1:26:05] preach great ministries Yes sir great
[1:26:08] gifts yes
[1:26:09] sir lost yes sir their adherence yes sir
[1:26:14] their respect yes sir amen their
[1:26:17] subjection yes sir to the ministry of
[1:26:19] God's Prophet that's right and they lost
[1:26:21] everything that's right the kingdom was
[1:26:24] stripped away yes sir because he did not
[1:26:28] recognize the channel that's exactly
[1:26:32] right the channel that got him where he
[1:26:36] [Applause]
[1:26:38] was brother the the the same Prophet
[1:26:41] that anointed him the king said the
[1:26:45] kingdom has ripped his metal and and and
[1:26:48] Saul ripped Samuel's
[1:26:51] metal when Samuel told him what had
[1:26:53] happened because an evil spirit had
[1:26:56] overtaken
[1:26:59] Saul may the Lord help us yes sir that
[1:27:03] principle holds true for both king and
[1:27:08] queen amen both are royalty yes my and
[1:27:13] we while we were on this two we trip we
[1:27:15] went to Branson Missouri and there they
[1:27:18] have the Sight and Sound Theater of one
[1:27:20] of two in the United states where they
[1:27:23] do Christian
[1:27:25] dramas and I don't
[1:27:27] mean it's it's if you've ever heard of
[1:27:29] it or seen of it's it's it's unlike
[1:27:31] anything you've ever heard they they
[1:27:34] bring everything to life and you're
[1:27:37] you're sitting there and on the sides
[1:27:39] and in front of you the drama is
[1:27:42] unfolding yes it's it's really something
[1:27:45] but this was on the story of Esther and
[1:27:47] and something that was really
[1:27:49] interesting and they brought this out a
[1:27:51] little bit
[1:27:53] when um
[1:27:56] aashis lost
[1:28:00] vashti his Dominion was
[1:28:05] jeopardized because by their law there
[1:28:09] had to be a king
[1:28:11] and a
[1:28:17] queen yes so without the queen without
[1:28:21] the
[1:28:23] without
[1:28:24] woman
[1:28:29] without amen you see it you see what's
[1:28:32] going on Amen so that's why the search
[1:28:36] went out but even that even Esther's
[1:28:39] rise to the throne right and recognizing
[1:28:45] that required the uh the involvement of
[1:28:49] her uncle yes Mor Mor
[1:28:52] yes my brother and the
[1:28:55] chamberlains who prepared her yes my
[1:28:58] brother just like The Messengers prepare
[1:29:01] the bride to be presented to
[1:29:04] [Applause]
[1:29:06] Christ so they prepared her she was
[1:29:09] accepted but even after she was accepted
[1:29:14] she did not fully
[1:29:16] appreciate her position as the
[1:29:20] queen
[1:29:22] right exactly right the ministry of
[1:29:27] Moriah opened her
[1:29:30] realization to why God had ordained the
[1:29:35] circumstances yes sir to put her yes sir
[1:29:38] as a Jewish Queen sir on the throne next
[1:29:42] to a pagan King yes my brother and so
[1:29:46] the edict Goes Forth and again this is
[1:29:48] I'm just following the leadership of the
[1:29:50] Lord the edict Goes Forth because hmon
[1:29:53] amen realized that Mori wouldn't bow to
[1:29:55] him so he gets gets this decree sign
[1:29:58] that all the Jews are going to be
[1:29:59] exterminated C none of them
[1:30:02] about why they're under another
[1:30:08] Dominion they were captives they were in
[1:30:11] bondage but they were still loyal to the
[1:30:14] kingdom that they were born into by a
[1:30:18] promise to
[1:30:20] Abraham
[1:30:23] amen so they would not forfeit their
[1:30:27] position amen that God had given them to
[1:30:31] even be spared their lives am am and
[1:30:35] here's Esther now it's it's a very
[1:30:36] desperate situation it's the lives of
[1:30:39] all of her people and possibly even her
[1:30:42] own that's right if this is discovered
[1:30:45] and she's overwhelmed she's overcome by
[1:30:47] this and it's placed her in in a great
[1:30:50] Jeopardy and great dist Stress and
[1:30:53] Anxiety and Mori comes to her yes sir it
[1:30:56] says Esther for such a time as
[1:31:01] this this these circumstances are
[1:31:05] exactly why you are where you are that's
[1:31:09] exactly and so many times we go Lord why
[1:31:14] me why me why did I get this diagnosis
[1:31:17] why is this happening to my children my
[1:31:19] family my parents my church all these my
[1:31:22] job all these why does this happen to me
[1:31:24] preach why not
[1:31:26] you preach how else PR would God prove
[1:31:31] himself Hallelujah vindicate you yes sir
[1:31:35] and place you in that very position to
[1:31:39] recognize you've got something to
[1:31:41] declare amen amen and if you don't
[1:31:45] declare it you'll die that's it if you
[1:31:47] don't recognize who you are and you're
[1:31:50] too shy or afraid or
[1:31:53] embarrassed to stand up yes sir and say
[1:31:56] listen the entire time amen I was
[1:32:00] somebody else's Queen before I became
[1:32:05] yours that's what she
[1:32:07] told
[1:32:09] hasis I was Jehovah's Queen before I
[1:32:12] became
[1:32:15] yours why don't you tell your
[1:32:18] boss why don't you tell that worldly
[1:32:21] boyfriend girlfriend goe I was royalty

[1:32:26] never make me anything more I've already
[1:32:29] been made the bride the Son and Daughter
[1:32:31] of Jesus
[1:32:32] Christ but if she did not stand if she
[1:32:35] did not recognize who she was she would
[1:32:39] perish and all her people amen and she
[1:32:41] had to get the courage yes to come
[1:32:44] forward yes sir and say I am a Jew and
[1:32:48] when she did he wrote a prot action amen
[1:32:53] of Grace amen that was for her yes sir
[1:32:57] showing election amen there was a
[1:33:00] protection against his own decree of
[1:33:03] death that Grace provided to shelter you
[1:33:07] from the Justice of the
[1:33:09] law the same King that wrote the decree
[1:33:12] of death wrote a decree of grace to the
[1:33:20] bride I I would again I'm venturing a
[1:33:23] bit here but I believe what what what
[1:33:26] aash was saying was because she is a Jew
[1:33:30] and because she's
[1:33:31] mine I gret this
[1:33:36] exemption sir now now that I recognize
[1:33:39] who she was before she became mine I

[1:37:52] the queen it's the bride joined to her
[1:37:55] headship amen you know I thought this
[1:37:58] was something when the when the when the

[1:38:57] fiance his fiance who is receiving the
[1:39:01] marriage
[1:39:02] proposal through the

[1:39:09] supper arise and shine for thy light is
[1:39:13] come and the glory of the Lord is risen
[1:39:17] upon thee amen oh it's wonderful and in
[1:39:21] the message Shalom he says here it say
[1:39:24] early at paragraph 41 he says we're
[1:39:25] facing here in our two subjects that we
[1:39:28] read the two scriptures rather a very
[1:39:32] contrast one to the other in Isaiah it
[1:39:36] says arise and shine for the glory of
[1:39:37] the Lord has come upon you the light is
[1:39:40] here and then the very next verse he
[1:39:45] says gross Darkness that's right is upon
[1:39:48] this people and then when we are in a

[1:40:36] the spirit of God moved upon the face of
[1:40:40] the water and said let there be
[1:40:45] light and God separated the light from
[1:40:49] the darkness yes sir and and I believe
[1:40:52] that we are now living in that hour
[1:40:55] again yes sir that when God is
[1:40:57] separating light from Darkness amen and
[1:41:01] he's pressing it to the other side of
[1:41:04] the world that the light may be made
