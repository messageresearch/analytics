of us can I give you one oh that's called the preacher you want to hear one you want to hear one they sent me a testimony it's coming from South Africa and I was listening to it today at work so it said No Deal and now it's a family that was living a little bit comfortable and they have a small car and as they were driving on the road they saw a big beautiful car and the voice spoke to the sister and say you can drive any car that you want to and the sister say the old teaching begin to come back and fight back and say no no no no no no we need to be humble we don't need those kind of stuff it's going to be staying and everything will be there and this this so she went home and she tuned in to spoken word and I was preaching about God wants you to prosper and be in good health as your soul prospects so she had the brainwash amen and it didn't take long her husband has to transfer a job and when the husband transfer job to company begin to fight to hire her husband and the husband got hired to one of them she said brother Stephen by the grace of God I'm driving that kind of car and she said not only that my children my daughter excel in school and the school system call

be in the house of the Lord David said I was glad when they said unto me let us go into the house of the Lord let us open our Bibles to Esther chapter number four we're gonna start from verse 9. today is going to be more of a Bible study Esther chapter number four verses nine we're gonna start from there we're ready and our touch came and told us to these words of Mordecai I get Esther speak unto her touch and gave him commandment unto Mordecai all the king servants and all the people of the king's provinces do nor that whatsoever were there man or woman shall come into the king into the inner Court who is not called there is one law of his to put him to death except such to whom the king shall hold out the golden scepter that he may live but I have not been called to come in unto the king these 30 days and they told to Mordecai Esther's words then Mordecai commanded to answer Esther think not with ice with thyself that thou shall Escape in the King's house more than all the Jews for if thou all together hold his thy peace at this time then shall their enlargement and deliverance arise to the Jews from another place but thou in thy father's house shall be destroyed and who knoweth whether at come to the kingdom for such a time as this please mark this for such a time as this answer go gather together all the Jews that are present in shushan and faster for me and neither drink neither eat nor drink the three days night or day I also in my maidens will Fast likewise and so will I go in unto the King which is not according to the law and if I perish let me perish so Mordecai went his way and and did according to all that Esther had commanded may God bless the reading of the word shall we pray dear heavenly father want to thank you for this evening Lord we have come under great expectation Lord may you take me aside Lord may you speak unto me are to these your children through these lips of clay we ask for the outpouring of the Holy Ghost in Jesus name we pray amen you may check your seats but don't sit on your mouth I want to hear that Hallelujah that amen we are so delighted to be back in the house of the Lord I'm a family member here and uh I left brother Greg in Ruth uh he was you really wanted to be here but because he got caught up because he's got some people that he was with but I'm very happy to see my brother Glenn God bless you we were together last night in the meetings may God bless you so much and I was so delighted and I think I saw brother Mike and his wife I think they just came back from Dubai last time I came here we were they invited us to their house and we were able to drink some tea you know us from Africa we love tea you say brother I've got a special tea for you and it really did us so good uh before we go any further I want us to go my brother Caleb I didn't put this court I just put it in the office if you can go in the message 570302 in the message and then Jesus came brother Stephen is an epitome of knowledge I was telling him in the office that it's very difficult to preach it's like I've been invited to a physics lecture when Albert Einstein is sitting down it's very difficult amen and when I was cutting the devil was soft was fighting me I was so busy the past week and it's about one two I'll try to prepare something would come up my wife got very sick and all kinds of things coming up and then when I was coming I was late to the airport and I forgot my my notes I forgot my my Bible in the car and I only realized that I was about to catch the flight but I mean we'll see what the Lord will do tonight let's go to and then Jesus came are you there Brothers 570302 paragraph E20 you know when I was in the plane of course we left so early like 3 A.M and the AC was so bad and I caught it like fever and I said the devil is a liar so is his mother-in-law and oh his step children let's go to and then Jesus came are you there brother 570302 [Music] and then Jesus came paragraph E20 are you there maybe while I'm while they are searching for it can you just greet your brother next to you and say good to see you brother good to see you 57 now she could not go to Jesus and then then Jesus came yeah I wanted the part which says did you ever notice did you ever notice okay did you ever notice that devil like to you want me to read it yeah go ahead did you ever notice the devil like to dwell in tombs they therefore stays around an old dead place and that don't exclude churches either that don't exclude spoken word either when they get colder it is a devil's hangout did you hear that amen did you ever notice the devil likes to dwell in tombs and the devil stays around an old dead place and that don't exceed spoken word Tabernacle either when they get colder it's the Devils hang out thank God so you want to hang out with the devil just get cold if Jesus is in this place this church must have life amen if Jesus is in this place this church must be a lively church amen it cannot be a church of dead people I know there is people who say I get Disturbed when others say Amen let me tell you you're in the wrong place if you want to hear you go to the tombs in church we say Amen to the world [Applause] [Music] in Psalm 81 verse 10 the Bible says open your mouth wide and I'll feel it so the circumference of your mouth when you say hallelujah determines what God is going to put inside the bigger the Hallelujah the bigger the blessings God is gonna let's give God a shout out praise I like the testimony the pastor gave he said he was teaching on the blessing right and someone in South Africa tapped into the anointing rather I refuse to be in this church and allow somebody who is Miles Away and catch our blessing the Bible says blessed be the father of our Lord Jesus Christ who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings Hallelujah so right where you are you are blessed Hallelujah it might not look like you are blessed but you are blessed [Applause] blessed us with all spiritual blessings it's not by the looks but it's by what God has declared he has blessed us with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places our God is rich in love he is rich in Grace he is rich in Mercy he has blessed me he has blessed you he has bless the bride so therefore I say we are blessed Hallelujah if the Bible says you are blessed then you are blessed Hallelujah I am blessed I'm blessed sure I am blessed whether the devil doesn't like it I am blessed I am blessed whether my neighbor doesn't like it I am blessed Hallelujah we are blessed the church is blessed amen the pride is blessed amen so you must wear a smile on your face and Shout that I am blessed lift up your sword Hallelujah God is shining upon you Hallelujah I don't care how sick you are but you are blessed Hallelujah I don't care what you're going through but you are blessed I don't care what problems that you have but you are blessed if you are blessed receive your blessing I want my blessing I want my healing I want my Holy Ghost baptism you know what I smell fire in this place I believe that somebody today will be healed I believe that somebody today who receive overcoming power [Applause] you may take your seats Brothers [Applause] so tonight we are going to speak on a very simple subject a heroic Ministry in such a time as this and with a little text that you should have killed the amalekites tell your name but you should have killed all the amalekites [Applause] man of God this is a beautiful pulpit this is a very beautiful pulpit a Pulpit is not a stage it's called a Pulpit because everyone who stands there was pulled out of a pit [Applause] so for such a time as this I'll try to teach a little bit today so for such a time as this you've got to be victorious I know that one of these days somebody will provoke victory for the Bride of Jesus Christ brother pranam says in the message Look Away to Jesus he says we are in a spiritual race allow me to put my own words so you can understand this he says it's like two vehicles running side by side and you wonder which vehicle is running faster but it says in this spiritual race the vehicle of the message of the hour had run far ahead of that of the Antichrist he says what we are doing Now is slowing down that's why it looks like things are slow in the economy of the Bride it's not it's all God's program after a mighty Revival Jesus took time to rest in the boat and the disciples were saddled with giving testimonies of what had taken place but something happened the storm came and it provoked Jesus to be called back on the scene that's why it looks like things are not going the way you want but it's all God's program we are giving great testimonies of the visitation of God in these last days but one of these days we are waiting for the Antichrist automobile to catch up and when it catches up then he says to watch the third pool he says what you see temporarily manifested will come into its fullness Hallelujah so nothing is out of Keta friends so that the root of this hour will know that the bridegroom is still in our midst and full of purpose like Boaz was given he gave a commandment to the young men he said for this lady she had served so well so every once in a while give a bonus are we together so these bonuses will be going on all the time healings Deliverance is great signs and wonders everything will be taking place Allelujah it might not be in the quantity of expectation but the Lord will prove that is still amongst his bride all the time so we see in the regime of the Antichrist things tightening up and to wind up to such a Time Hallelujah that will that will know that our God is Raising some heroes in some champions for such a time as this tonight you are not gonna live here without some sort of display did you hear that you aren't gonna live here without some sort of display this is the seventh Age We Are Back To The Feast of isras was one of the richest kings ever known he had control over 127 provinces I don't know if any any other country that has got 127 States yet I think America has got 100 about 51 or 52. but after and and for six months the Bible says he was displaying his wealth nobody saw the same thing twice are we together then after the six months display he decided to have a fist time for seven days so each fifth day he will tell his guys that you haven't seen nothing yet because this King had in his mind that on the seventh day I'm gonna show the people my greatest treasure so the greatest Treasure of ayesaras was that his Bentley the greatest Treasure of ayeseras was in his private jet the greatest treasure over here was in this Palace was his bride so vashti a type of a Pentecostal Church refuse is display that is what introduced Esther somebody who looks like a stranger to the economy blessings of the Jews getting the blessings of the Gentiles I haven't started preaching yet so anyhow Esther in God's Providence because she must show us a type was selected Among The Virgins that will appear for consideration at each of the virgins when they came near haggai haggai was a king's Chamberlain who is the preparer of virgins are we together and he was made a eunuch so that he cannot interact with these ladies in that manner are we together if we have a hot guy in this day he never gave us his seed he never gave us his thoughts he never gave us his ideas he never gave us his opinions [Applause] that which I received from the Lord like Paul says the same I delivered that's what this haggai did Hallelujah that guy doesn't fuse with no man he gives you what you want so each of these ones they were came they were they were coming with opinion of what they thought was acceptable before the king and hakai was giving it because it only represents the only light left it's going to shine upon the real wheat and the real tears are we together they are not two sons there's only one son s-u-n it doesn't change the seed that you are but it only transformed that same seed to come through different maturity whether good or bad that's why you need sunlight that is why Judas Iscariot yet to come and be with Christ I think it would be wrong for us to suggest that Jesus never knew who Judas was from day one he knew him his induction into apostleship was not by accident halleluia because his role is to fulfill Peter cannot do it and it is necessary for you and me to Rejoice at Salvation so Christ knew him and he put him there this guy needed Jesus so that the seed in him can go through different developmental stages of his life so that it could fulfill the purpose just like Peter needed him we all need him tonight that's why the Dynamics of Peter Judas and everyone was not it was in this hands of the same person so when Judas Iscariot became right ripened by Jesus's assessment Jesus gave him an inspiration he says that which thou doeth too quickly when when he gave that message only Judas understood it in the context in which it was given [Applause] [Music] can I preach it like a black man so these ladies maybe 1 000 they were they gathered together and they were asking for this in that and hug I was dishing it out but the Bible says when it came the time of Esther it says Esther required nothing except that guy in his own wisdom she had dropped her personal belief she wasn't living by her own opinion she had a testimony like Paul he says I live by the faith of the son of God Hallelujah said to look like a guy you know the king better you are the one who's closest to the king so whatever you think you give it to me brothers and sisters there was only one man in this age Hallelujah who was closest to God they call him William Marion Branham he said I was not the one who appeared at Ohio River but I was the one nearest when he appeared he says a man is what we feel he says you are not feeding on me but you are feeding on the unfailing body weight of this son of man Hallelujah so one day God was so happy with this man and he gave him an offer and he said would you like who to walk with me and the hand in hand in the wilderness they were working together so he qualifies to be by every standard to be the haga of this hour he knows what king I said as King Jesus of this hour what he likes so when Esther prepared herself by her guy's teaching she appeared before I hesaras and she became the Delight of ayeseras because ayeseras could see his reflection in her what was still lost Esther gained and she became the final display you know what I've been doing I've been telling the story of your life so don't worry the full Vindication of God of Heroes in this hour will come into full manifestation I congratulate you all so we are here [Applause] for another battle brother Branham says he says you can't have a victory unless there is a battle so a hero is someone who is a powerful word it's someone who he speaks of someone who is courageous someone who's adventurous someone who is fearless or someone who can break the norm so this world has used this word hero to talk about Batman and all the superheroes or the Superman up until we have so much in our young people who know more about Batman than the Heroes of Faith but these Heroes of Faith in the Bible they cannot be compared to the heroes of this world but we are called to be true Pride Heroes for such a time as this so every biblical character we read in the scripture had a unique place at the unique role in the purpose for some we read about their lifespan for decades for others we only read about them for a few hours but with our limited ability with our mind's ability it is difficult to comprehend every aspect of the scripture to place a value of one hero in the Bible above another because everyone in the Bible they're the very single uh role to play how do you convey Abraham with Noah how do you convey Noah with Jeremiah how do you convey Elijah with sermon of Cyrene we all know about Elijah Elijah shut the heaven he was a hero Elijah called for fire from heaven Elijah dropped the mantle of Elisha are we together the impact of Elijah's Ministry was so measurable that King Ahab called Elijah a man who had troubled Israel so heroes are destructive heroes are known for causing a problem heroes are known for causing trouble to the waters do we have heroes in Charlotte this evening Hallelujah I said to the young people if the devil doesn't know your name it's a problem he's supposed to know your name Paul I know Caleb I know Peter I know you've got to be heroes to cause destructive to the enemy Hallelujah the devil has to know your name are we together somebody preached back to me Hallelujah so when you read the scripture about the Heroes of Faith Elijah is the man that traveled Israel but his role covers many years more than that the spirit of Elijah brother God is so good that he could use the same spirit and use it more than once because the spirit speaks of something so we see the spirit of Elijah was found on Elisha and that same Spirit was found on John the Baptist and that same Spirit was found on William Branham and that same spirit will come back to the Jews so don't tell me that we cannot have Heroes because God promised a visitation he said the spirit of Elijah who come upon Elisha Hallelujah so brother says everyone is a Ministry everyone has a road to play right and everyone is the road to being a hero but Elijah is one of the bigger names what about Simon of Cyrene sermon of Cyrene was not a prophet there were no books written about him his name was not found in Hebrews 11 when Paul was recounting The Heroes of Faith but in God's Great drama in which we all have a place sermon of Cyrene finds himself in a uni at a unique place at the right time Simon of Cyrene was not a Roman he was not a Jew he was from Cyrene but he finds himself in Jerusalem in the closing days of Jesus's Ministry amen I'm here to tell somebody today that everyone whose code is a hero Hallelujah everyone is a part to play I don't care the part the size of the part but it's important for us to Allah to play our part and if we find our place then the devil is finished brother pranam says perfect faith is based on your position and when you are in a position you can tell the devil you get out of here this is mine this is my house this is my children this is my body Hallelujah you can tell the devil that sickness you don't have a right to be in this body because I know my place I know my position I know what I'm called to do amen glory to God so the entire Old Testament was pointing to the coming of Messiah amen the New Testament talks about the Messiah what he did how how he lived and how do you would forever change the world but sermon of Cyrene the unlikely hero finds himself in the days after the Feast of the Passover amen and with this history people were carrying crosses on their way to be crucified crucifixions were common in Jerusalem but this day was different Hallelujah among the men to be crucified was a man called Jesus a man who did nothing to deserve it amen a man without sin and he was being laughed out at and being spit upon and he was bruised he was weary and he couldn't Carry the Cross how precious it is to carry the cross of Jesus Amen Simon of Cyrene was commanded to carry the cross so every biblical character stepped forward playing their roles in God's Great drama but there's another man that I want to talk about in a few minutes who was a man after God's Own Heart you know him yet in God's Great drama like this man he had a unique distinction right he is described by God in both the Old and the New Testament as a man after my own heart that's exactly what a man who shall fulfill my will amen this man is called David yes I just want to talk about David a little bit a little bit before we strike our text this evening go ahead so when the children of Israel looked around to look for a king they looked they checked and found a man the popular vote was so right this man was tall he was a good family man he was very powerful man a lot of people loved this man that was man's choice but David was God's choice amen are we together so what makes David unique is he was a little Shepherd he was a musician you think of him being anointed by his soul by Samuel as you read the book of Psalms in the life of David you see every possible emotion a man could ever possess so David passed through he was a man of Faith he was a man of Joy he passed through a lot of pain you had so much grief in his spirit and so much desire but so much sadness and every emotion that a man could ever possess but he grows up in our very eyes and we see he was a man after God's Own Heart are we together so throughout the scripture you see the clips of people's lives you see here and there and you don't know much about people's lives but David was different right so we see David was a Shepherd right David was a hunter we see him as a warrior right we see him as a general right we see him as a king we see him as a poet we see him as a champion we see him as an outlaw we see him as a ladies man we see David as a musician we see him as a prophet right we see him as a worship leader we see him as an adulterer we see him as a murderer we see him as a brother we see him as a husband we see him as a son right we see him as a parent right we see him as a leader but he was an ancestor of the lineage of Christ he was a man after God's Own Heart amen despite his ups and doubts he was still numbered in Hebrews 11 and I'm here to tell you that despite your absent outs you will be in that number amen amen glory to God so whenever you feel low you always want to go to the Book of Psalms right Caleb let's go to Psalm 1 Psalm 23 we all know it that's right the Lord is my shepherd right this is a hero speaking right are we together the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want he makes me lie down in Green Pastures he lead at me beside the Still Waters He restored my soul he leaded me in the path of righteousness for his namesake this is how Heroes speak he says yeah yeah though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death amen I will fear no evil for thou art with me thyroid and thy stuff comfort me he says Thou prepare us that table for me in the presence of my enemies don't tell me that you don't have enemies because he wants to prepare a table in the presence of your enemies somebody preach back to me amen so give God an opportunity to prepare a table in the presence of your enemies Hallelujah yes sir let's go to the next verse he says Thou prepare us a table he says surely goodness and mercy shall follow me Hallelujah he says surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life Hallelujah and I will shall dwell in the house of the Lord forever that's how Heroes speak speak like a hero amen hallelujah wherever you go whenever I leave my house goodness and mercy shall follow me amen when I go to school goodness and mercy shall follow me when I'm at my job goodness and mercy shall follow me when I come to church goodness and mercy shall follow me Hallelujah that's how Heroes speak speak like a hero amen talk like a hero live like a hero Hallelujah let the world talk about their Black Panther in there Batman or something but I wanna be a real hero I wanna walk on water I want to speak to the elements right I want to say you little fish I give you back your life that's a real hero walk like a hero dress like a hero amen speak like a hero pray like a hero sing like a hero worship like a hero somebody preach back to me amen foreign [Applause] doesn't mean you won't get afraid but when all hell is against you that's when the spirit comes my God I feel like preaching us can I preach to you you are a hero waits for such a time as this [Applause] next slide listen to David he says Lord how are they that that increase that trouble me go ahead many a day that Rise Against Me many they wish say of my soul there is no help for him in God that's how Heroes speak he says but thou art oh Lord at my shield for me my glory and the lifter of mine had I Cried unto the Lord with my voice and they hate me out of his Holy Hill he had the words of the hero this evening I will not be afraid of it 10 000 people that have set themselves against me you want one more he says I'll lift up my eyes unto the heels from whence cometh my help my help coming from the Lord which made Heaven and Earth and he will not suffer that food to be moved if David was here he was going to say I was glad when they said unto me let us go into the house of the Lord give God a shout out praise let me give you a small testimony there is a pastor in Africa South Africa to uh Zimbabwe to be specific but he went to South Africa for Revival meetings his name is brother pastor gumiso so they went to Cape Town and in the midst of the services you know the atmosphere was already charged like the way it's charged here do you believe that we are creatures of atmosphere the reason why you are here tonight anything Hallelujah read my lips tonight anything yes sir can happen tonight amen hallelujah it's not because brother Stephen is here but because we are creatures of atmosphere you are the one who create the atmosphere [Applause] are we together amen so this sister was in a wheelchair and because she had an accident and she couldn't walk the doctors had written her off says she'll never walk again all her legs the bones were broken she was in the wheelchair but she purposed in her heart that when I got to these meetings I'm gonna go home walking again amen those are the kind of Heroes that I like talking about amen so she came in a wheelchair as the word was being preached the sister would move a wheelchair from the aisle and she would go forward and you say hallelujah and she would raise her hands like yes my brother are we together amen the doctors had said she'll never walk again but God said you will walk again amen I don't care about the doctor's report are we together we are heroes for such a time as this so as the word was being preached she kept saying amen and the preacher caught and said you sister you shall walk amen are we together amen it says you will walk and the sister believed you know what she did she just stood down from the wheelchair and she praised God Amen is there anybody in a wheelchair tonight maybe this is for you you know this sister was in a wheelchair but she was saying hallelujah amen you you are not in a wheelchair and you are just sitting like this come on come on come on come on Charlotte come on Charlotte [Applause] thank you my brother can I

lifts you up no man can bring you down God is on your side healing is on your side rapturing faith is on your side body change is on your side [Applause] thank you give God a shout out praise I'm gonna skip a lot of things I might have to come back again so the revealed word I don't think we'll be able to preach this this amalekites but we'll try to cover a little bit amen so the revealed mystery truths will literally turn your hearts back to your Apostolic fathers aren't you thankful tonight that that's your heritage that's your inheritance we have heard the reviewed word and we have heard the message of the hour Allelujah and there was a book that was written inside stood with Seven Seals and those shoes were hiding inside the book of instead there was a revelation that was sealed so we hear that the book was closed are we together and we know that the book was the Bible are we together and when you read the the there is no other name in heaven uh you see the Pentecostals when they read the same Bible they're not I didn't receive the message of Oral Roberts but we received a message that was sent to Malachi 4. are we together that is why they can ordain women preachers the book is sealed are we together they still baptize people with phds and all that they still baptized in the name of the Father the Son and the Holy Ghost what is happening the book is sealed allow me to talk about this book for a few minutes brother this book is powerful this book can put food on your table this book can remove bad luck in your life this book can remove generational cases amen this book can Reign mana on your table amen hallelujah this book can open the eyes of the blind this book can give you a son-in-law this book can give a daughter-in-law this book can give you accommodation rather when the book is closed brother you can you can be smoking and coming to church because the book is closed when this book is closed you can come to church and still be a witch when the book is closed you can do all kinds of things Hallelujah but this Bible when it's open it is the power to change it is power to deliver it has power to make you a Christian lady Hallelujah and when you see your name I saw my name in The Book of Life when you see your name it's your inheritance it that doesn't give you your healing it has your name attached to it overcoming power is for calabignon overcoming power is for you hallelujah oh the Bible says who is worthy to open the book and to lose the Seven Seals thereof in John verse 1 says weep not John Hallelujah he says the tribe Hallelujah the lion of the tribe of Judah it prevailed and took the book Hallelujah so tonight I want you to take the book he wasn't given the book but he took it rather when it's yours you are not given you take it are we together don't wait to be given seconds Hallelujah don't wait to be laid hands on take it my brother check your inheritance check your healing check your overcoming power take your blessing amen hallelujah check your marriage take your house amen take your rupturing Faith amen don't wait to be given because it's your property the book is open take it Allelujah that's the end of your problems that's the end of your issues check your salvation it belongs to you amen and what I like about this message this message will put you in the rapture [Applause] [Music] this message will reserve a seat for you in the marriage supper this message is the shout the Lord himself shall descend with a shout that's the message of the hour shout is the Gathering of the Eagles together in preparation for the rapture the message of the hour Allelujah is the Capstone Ministry the message of the hour is The Rock the stone that Daniel saw the message of the hour did not come from a seminar College the message of the hour did not come from Rome it did not come from America but it came from above so this message is the quickening power this message of the hour is the power of Resurrection this message of the hour is the healing of your body that's right and it's the healing of the bright body amen I'm getting excited now what does the Bible say the Bible says in the Book of Malachi before the promise of the of Elijah it says the son of righteousness shall rise with healing in his come on with his wings let me tell you something what was the Vindication of William Branham when he when he when he already got that gift because the son of righteousness is already risen what was the Vindication or the sign of the commission what sign of gift was given in his hand to dictate the diseases of the people that was the vindication that it was the end time prophet the gift of healing was a vindication what that he was to forerun the second coming of the Lord Jesus Christ do you know why God gave him that gift you know why because he was the messenger of the Resurrection he was the messenger of the rapture are we together he was the messenger of the change of the body so what did he do God gave him that gift to dictate every disease why was it so because Divine Healing is the down payment of the body change did you hear that Divine Healing is a down payment of the change of the body if God can heal your cancer that's just a fortest of what will happen to you one day not only cancer in your stomach but the whole body will be changed Hallelujah that's why we don't measure on healings because to add that Elementary level we focus on the body change Hallelujah when you hear faith comes by hearing so hearing by the word of God and that's your healing are we together rupturing Faith lays in the message how many believe they are going to be raptured Hallelujah so what you are saying you are saying already you are healed because that's that's your down payment halleluia that's why we're giving the mantle of Elijah not the mantle of Oral Roberts not the matter of Billy Graham amongst us healing is not a thing the same God who restored the brother's car in the days of the Prophet is the same God who restored my wallet last week that I lost [Applause] the same God who healed sister middle is the same God who healed my mother of a cancerous breast lamp are we together and when the you see the Deadpool brother it's already are we together be like the Centurion speak the word only and I know my servant will be healed what does the Bible say about your condition what does the Bible say about your requests speak the word only the Bible says and by my stripes you are you are we together so every sick person here must receive their healing upon that scripture are we together why would you go out sick tonight when the Bible says by my stripes you are healed if I were you if I was sick I would take God in this word and say the Bible says the Bible says the Bible says the Bible says I am healed I believe my Bible from cover to cover Hallelujah in the beginning was the word not a denomination in the beginning was not Pope it was the word in the beginning was not your disease it was the word in the beginning was not your problem it was the word in the beginning was not your weakness it was the word hallelujah and the Word was with God and as the word what was was with God the word became flesh and the word when it became flesh it was walking down up and down in Galilee it was walking down up and down in kapenham and in Judea but I want to tell you something tonight as the word became flesh today your flesh My Flesh has become halleluia has become the world Oh Glory to God who are you today you are the word made flesh Allelujah even if they take away the spoken word books from us even if they take away the Bibles from us it's to let devil because the word is already in US even if they close our churches it's too late devil brother pranam says fellowshipping like this will become fond memories right but he says but when that time comes yes sir Hallelujah when this peace comes right he says watch the Deadpool then that's right the third pool is already in it is already manifesting amen but it do not come in full measure until that time something will provoke it right something [Applause] something will come from us right and we are waiting for that time amen the devil is a liar amen let's go to the next court Abraham says in the message of blushing Prophet it ought to be the happiest time in the world for the Christian times are going to change the world is going to be young death is going to Fleet away sickness will be normal no more prayer meetings for the sick no more prayer meetings for the lost but God shall come and take the elect from the Four Winds of the earth and Shall Gather them under the wings and will give and reign with him forever in heaven he says oh brother sister friend of mine if you are not prepared tonight may you be prepared at this hour I give you an invitation to come to Christ through Jesus Christ tonight and receive you that's different you know what you're going to what you are not where you should be with God he says I invite you to the altar with myself I invite every one of your soul from uh from everything that's unlike him until you go out a new person with no compluster on but go out here with a blood transfusion that purifies your blood and gives you a new life A New Hope amen you go out with the baptism of the Holy Ghost that's it so I'm the happiest man alive to see the Fulfillment of Malachi 4's message coming into view next quote the message the Mighty God I'm identified with that group that knows he's unveiled that knows he's the same yesterday today and forever that knows that this is not fanaticism it's Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever I'm identified with that group here tonight yet they called the badge of Heretics and banjo Fanatics fanaticism on account of the word but I'm not ashamed of the Gospel of Jesus Christ because it's the power of Salvation so for such a time as this do you know who you are you are predestinated seeds of God the final voice to the final age a manifestation of the prophet's prophecy when the message Christ is re is the mystery of God revealed he says now let's go to the next slide now you are going to do no let's go to the Christ is re Christ is the mystery but if you don't have it it's fine now what you are going to do when you get all that group together whether Revelation is perfectly in Harmony and God expressing it through his word by the same actions the same things that he did making the word manifest or if the church only knew its position it will one day then the Rapture will go amen so the secret is out the pride knows who she is you didn't come by mistakes Hallelujah all your problems was leading you to such a time as this National Force put Israel in a Homeland National Force will put the church in the world Council of churches but the power of God will put the bride and the power of God is here tonight for such a time is this the world forces this way and it forces that way Hallelujah but God will force you upward that's the Thunder that shakes the devil justification made a way for you sanctification sanctification made the word for the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the baptism of the Holy Ghost made a way for the Holy Ghost itself to manifest itself again for such a time as this beg to send Mark 16 where God was taking back to we see the actions where God was doing miracles signs and wonders the Bible speaks of shamgar shamgar was a hero Hallelujah each time he would plant his plant you know the devil will come and get his Harvest do we have someone like shamgar tonight whatever you do the devil will just come and take what's yours whatever brother comes he just comes and he lives I feel like shamgar anointing tonight shamgar was a hero one day he says enough is enough can I say enough is enough tonight you've been doing something you are looking for a job you do something but enough is enough Shankar thought they were coming in say I feel a heroic anoint yes my brother shamgar saw them coming and he started going and he destroyed everyone Hallelujah says is this the time for such a time as this you are David's he says you are cold you are anointed you are positionally put in the body of Jesus Christ by the baptism of the Holy Ghost these are the prophet's words Goliath he says Goliath you are defeated he is defeated tonight amen hallelujah that doctor so and so say this but Christ who made you to stop your drinking Christ who made you to stop your lying Christ who made you to stop your stealing oh Goliath are breaking tonight you like a lot we are heroes who is this uncircumcised Philistine his master Was Defeated on Calvary by the Lord Jesus Christ and because he conquered we shall conquer because Christ is our hero we are also heroes brother we are not going to live here on Earth and say thank God we barely made it we're going to live here as conquerors as Heroes we are going to cause smoke to the devil's face he's going to regret why he ever met us we are going to destroy all the amalekites all the Hittites all the heights [Music] [Applause] because the end time bride Heroes have been raised to destroy all the spirits all the demons all the foul spirits and all the sickness this is our season this is our time oh it's a good land you're flowing like milk and honey it's our inheritance says in the message him he says there will be a power put in the church and that power is coming now and that Holy Spirit Will so anoint the people till they'll speak one word that will create itself Hallelujah in another message and know it is not he says I'm only building the hour is closed at hand and we are come to see something happen when something is going to take place Allelujah [Music] can I preach for 10 minutes let me deal with the spirit of amalek a little bit so does in Exodus 17. verse 16. let's read together for he said let's read together because the Lord has sworn that the Lord will have war with amalek from generation to generation oh for he said the Lord is sworn that you have war with amalek from generation to generation now it's of Paramount importance for us to know who amalek is and what the spirit of amalek before we control it when it comes up now amalek was a son of elephants and elephants was a Duke of Edom those were one of the sons of ADA if you read the book of Genesis 36 and Ada was one of the wives of Esau so when amalek was was actually from the generation of Esau are we together but there's something about amalek that God said he says anywhere you see this nation anywhere you see this seed he says I have war against them are we together if you watch in the Bible akan was one of the great great grandsons of amalek are we together that is why when God came up when this Spirit came up it went to Mordecai and God was angry the spirit of amalek is that spirit that comes to take control of a man and pushes him into major mistakes in his weak state foreign is that spirit that waits for that day yes sir when we are weak right and takes over you pushes you to do dangerous errors the spirit of amalek is that spirit that takes advantage of your vulnerability that's exactly right of your weakness that's exactly right in Genesis 17 when the sorry yes yes yes yes in Genesis 17 when the people were tested for water and they wanted to drink water amalek rose up in that weak State and he knew they were too weak to fight when he knew that they were too weak to lift up their heads that's when amalek came up in that journey and God was provoked and God was angry the spirit of amalek is that spirit that pushes many believers to error the spirit of amalek is that Spirit That Came Upon David when all his friends had gone to war to the battle and he knew David's weakness Kings have gone to war Kings have gone to fight that is one when David stayed back and when he stayed back the spirit of amalek entered him and he saw a woman called Bathsheba Alleluia and he saw her and the Bible says he desired her when the spirit of amalek enters a person it suspends your senses and that is why God was angry are we together and God said to David upon this sin that you have sinned I have become angry with you at that weakness of his life are we together that's when the spirit of amalek came into his life have you ever seen when when when when the lion wants to get a deer or an animal it looks for an animal or a deer that has got a crippled leg the one which is weak that believer who doesn't come to church on Wednesdays that believer who doesn't come to church regularly that believer who stopped coming to church when covet hit that believer who wants to come who just like live streaming rather if you are not careful if you use of live streaming you can live stream heaven [Applause] [Laughter] the spirit of amalek preach are we together it comes to take you over in a weak state there are some Believers today who have done so many things that they shouldn't have done they look at their lives there are certain mistakes that they should have you know that they shouldn't have made so amalek waited and attacked them when they were their weakest the period they were down in prayer the will period they were not sensitive the period they were not fasting are we together the spirit of amalek is that spirit that entered Samson are we together when he wanted to do great things that when it came to him but we came to raise war against amalek whatever has entered you today we will correct it in Deuteronomy 25 we're about to close verse 17. the Bible says remember what amalek did unto thee by the way when when they came forth unto Egypt he says how he met thee by the way and smart the Hindi the hidden most part of the and all those who were feeble behind and thou was faint and weary and feared not God so in Israel when they were weak they they would put strong men in front are we together and they would put with people at the back halleluia so when amalek wanted to Smite them the Bible says he came from behind and began to Smite every one of them and God was angry God said how could you attack a man in his weak state are we together how can you fight a man when he's not strong why didn't that Temptation come when you were from your three days of fasting and prayer why didn't that prayer the why didn't that Spirit come Hallelujah why did it wait for you when you were not praying why didn't amalek attack you when we were coming from an all night prayer why did it wait for a season that were weak God said I am angry with amalek that's right that is taking advantage of the people Hallelujah so the Bible says amalek came from behind and always from the back I'm sorry to people who stay at the back he came from the back and he started attacking everybody by the time they risked we reached in front that's when he turned his back and went away and God was angry [Applause] and God says amalek halleluia and he says anywhere you see this seed I will have raised war from generation to generation so we see in the Bible there was a man called Haman and Haman was is interesting because Haman shouldn't have existed Hamman was the from the descendants of the amalekites at that time the amalekites shouldn't have existed Hallelujah because the instruction was given many years ago to wipe out all the amalekites if the amalekites were wiped out how much shouldn't have been born that's right but the Bible says when the children of Israel left Egypt they they had you know they've been slaves and you know they were amalekites they were Hittites and and so forth and they didn't even know how to fight but the Bible says amalek attacked them when they were their weakest the Philistines are the people who are strong they sent Goliath give us a a man who can fight let me tell you something before I forget in second Samuel 2. we see they saw God loved us all right David laughed so right now David they were coming from the war and then men of God there is a brother who just came from Norway people were rejoicing and they said oh I saw so was about to die and they said was about to die so what happened I want you to watch this brother who just came from nowhere go ahead my brother he just so so I he said no I saw so and he was about to die and David was seated with his servants and he said but why then what happened he said I took a knife and I slaughtered him and Dave says who is this brother he said I'm an amalekistan really he waited for so to be in his weakness and then he attacked him preached my brother and he says what did you one says I wanted the crown of his head amalek wants the crown of your head pray to my brother he wanted to take Prestige of someone who is about to die right you know what David said he said gentlemen what are you waiting for yo this man killed those amalekites and the Bible says they smote him into pieces what are those amalekites in your life those things that causes you to sin is that a magazine is that movies is that pornography those things that attack you when you're at your weakest wait my brother [Music] I can't preach about this let us stand on our feet the third pool he says you can ask for sister Edith to come out of the wheelchair but there is a promise of a body change he says your parents can actually be young I mean there's a body change so meaning that even the parents could have been tanned to 19 years old are we together is there someone who's sick tonight the Deadpool power is here Allelujah we have our inheritance we claim our possession there's going to be a rapture Hallelujah we shall all be changed in a twinkling of an eye we are not dying brother we are not preaching the message from ashes to ashes but we know we have a promise brother Branham says there's going to be a bomb for America there's going to be a bomb for Russia but before they bump my flesh there is an exodus there is an Ephesians Hallelujah we are moving from this mystery Babylon Hallelujah and we are going into the New Jerusalem and your flesh is the mystery Babylon are we together those amalekites we are raised for such a time as this to destroy them when you go home read the book of Esther uh uh when you read this the whole story you hear that Haman wanted worship he said there's people who don't want to come who want don't want to come to our concerts of all the 127 provinces you find here and there they are all around here and he wanted people to bow down and Mordecai said I'm not gonna Bow Down I'm not an amalekite I'm a true pride of Jesus Christ and Haman wanted worship and you know the story when they went to the king and the King said what should we do for the king for the person who do this and that and because Haman liked worship he said give him a horse give him a garment and all that he is the king and and he said that you know give all this to Mordecai are we together when you go home read the book of Esther yes and Haman because he wanted to cause the children of God not to do the right thing and he said go and hang him right there up up there so that people can see Hallelujah because Esther had hidden himself because she didn't want to expose her identity sometimes we don't want to expose our identity in schools at work that we are believers when they say can you drink you drink because you are scared but the spirit of amalek right attacks you when you're at your weakest but we are born for such a time as this to be a hero in the champion Hallelujah is the pastor is coming can you sing for us a song a powerful praise song Amen one day I'm going to be an idea one day I'm gonna take a step [Music] I said is [Music] [Applause] [Music] come on [Music] oh one day I'm good [Music] it's going to set me free [Music] the perfect morning [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] amen amen amen amen glory to God amen amen amen amen what a powerful message amen it's amazing why the Lord doesn't want us to get into the second banquet he locked him up right there [Applause] [Laughter] did you notice that did you see how he went deeper and getting and getting and the Holy Spirit just block it right there oh my God I was waiting like keep moving keep moving keep moving and then look suddenly like a helicopter coming down amen there is more to that thing amen oh my God oh my God he was really getting closer amen amen amen there is more to the Book of Esther than you ever think amen there is even the second coming of the Lord in the Book of Esther yes it's all hidden right there amen but the Holy Spirit unfolded unfolded until he stopped I will wait till he gave me the signal to open it up but I know it's there he already gave it to me and he took me to a different route I have to follow the GPS until we can get there but something is gonna happen amen it's a powerful book that is filled with a lot of stuff and if you study you will see which generation of the American Esther destroy I will tell you that one day and you will see how perfectly it line up that the generation has to destroyed was what because God say he will have war from generation to generation and you will see how many War of the amalikat was in the Bible he lined up with brother Brown a message Straight Ahead perfectly everything in life and you will see how the king is going out angry and the king is also coming back again and then the king and all of that there is like seals locked up there by God's grace so keep being patient God willing once he opened the door we will get to the second banquet because that was almost preached tonight so look at those little things amen that tried to bother you on your weakest moment get it off just remember eating a malachite amen when you're trying to pray and you see something coming up and trying to take you away from a prayer you just know something is going on it's in America amen when you see it don't give him a chance because if you get a chance he would do you like he did so wipe him completely off amen do you know that God gave Soul the commission to destroy amalek one time forever amen God even told him that I remember what I saw that me and amalek we will finish together and I'm giving you this commission go ahead and fulfill that commission and Saul took and spare the king and do you know the name of that King agat and do you know the Bible say hey man was the agar guide so the very thing that Soul left going out that thing keep bothering up and attacking the Jews on the other side but thank God you were being raised for such a time as this one Amen in other words you're not here by accident the Bible said we were predestined that we were ordained for good work so there is a Ministry God already locked into you and when the Holy Spirit is coming he's Awakening you remember the seed got potential now the seed need to open whatever potential God put on you to fulfill before we leave here amen we got a mission and that mission will be fulfilled amen even this Pulpit had a mission because there was a Pulpit here but the first pope uh completed its course then there's the next moment so if another bullet again so there is a purpose for this puppet did you see setting the record straight do you see how it's climbing higher because it's going somewhere amen it is not me it is the holy spirit that is shooting the devil everywhere even if he hides somewhere the spirit of the Lord is coming and shooting him amen that's why when you come to this church you will notice most of the time things that you done at home or discussion that you were having at home or maybe you were talking to somebody you come to this church it looks like the preacher was sitting with you or he was overhearing you and things like that because there is a radar that is now controlling your life it's like a John that is controlling your life even if you are under destruction the John will report it and send it to the Holy Spirit and say there is an America trying to destroy so and so and when you get here suddenly brother Stephen is offline and then they go ahead and shoot it and kill the devil and you look you say my goodness there was a devil right here don't worry somebody is taking care of you somebody is protecting you somebody is watching you 360 he's watching your life when something comes from this puppet and expose your life don't get angry it is God zeroed it in into an amalekitis all you have to do if something bad repent and correct yourself you killed the American amen that's all God is doing because the highest form that God can reveal himself brother Brian I'm saying it is in his word amen so don't get upset to a Pulpit here to a minister who's standing here especially if you know he doesn't know what you did and it's coming straight same word in other words you went to the doctor you come back and you hear a minister saying you went to the doctor just know it is not the minister the John has been reporting in other words your life is so precious that God is determined now no more gave me the message no more game with your life whoever want to play around with you God will destroy him completely out because God is determined to prepare you for the Rapture God ain't playing game no more and you not going no way you become a prisoner now everything that you do he's gonna unveil it amen so come up a little higher let's pray
