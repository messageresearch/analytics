And Lord, that's our desire this morning, Lord, is to trust you, Lord. To trust you with our our life, Lord, our decisions, Lord, with every step that we walk, Lord, every word that comes out of our mouth, Lord. And Lord, as the song says, where you send us, Lord, let us go, Lord God. Let us obey, Lord. Father, sometimes we get in the way, Lord God. Sometimes we doubt, Lord God. We just question whether or not it's really you even speaking to us, Lord. But Lord, in this little assembly, Lord, we've come to learn that, Lord, that we can trust you, Lord God. You've brought us through so much, Lord God, and you've brought us here to this wonderful place that you've prepared for us to meet you every time we come together, Lord. And that sweet fellowship does follow, Lord God. For the love in this congregation, Lord, exceeds a human realm, Lord God. It's agape, Lord God. It's your love that we have in us, Lord, that we're able to share with each other, Lord God, and to pray for each other, Lord, and to help each other, Lord God, and to worship our mighty God, together, Father, in unity, Lord Jesus. So we ask one more time Lord just one more time as Samson said. Come amongst us this morning Lord God. Make your presence known Lord and manifest yourself Lord and vindicate the word Lord God. We love you Lord God. We want to worship you this morning Lord. Lord if we if we have trouble with that trust Lord God help us Lord. Speak to us this morning, Lord, and let us trust you, Lord God, even to the things that might even not even sound rational, Lord. Just have your will and help us, Lord God, to obey every step. We thank you, Father. We ask that you bless our musicians this morning, Lord God. That you bless our singers, Lord Jesus. That you bless our technicians as well, Lord. that everything not only goes perfect here inside the building but across the stream Lord for we know it reaches many places Lord around the world and many people. Let that anointing go through the wire, Lord. And above all, Lord God, go to that little front room up there, Lord, and sit there with our pastor, Lord, and bless him, Lord God, and anoint him this morning, Lord, and let him bring forth the word as you and him have prepared, Lord, together, probably overnight, Lord God. We thank you. Bless him, Lord. Bless him in a special way. bless his family, Lord, for we know, Lord, it's not just his calling, but it's theirs also for a pastor. We thank you, Father. We give every bit of this service to you in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. And amen and amen. Let's give him a clap offering this morning. Turn around and greet your neighbor as well and say, "Welcome to the house of the Lord." Amen. Praise God. [Music] [Music] Alas, and did my savior bleed and did my sovereign die? Who would he devote that sacred head for such a worm as I? Oh, at the cross at the cross where I first saw the light and the burden of my heart it brought away. Yes, it was there by faith. I receive my sight and now I'm happy all the day. Was it for crimes that I had done? He grown up on that tree. Amazing be the grace unknown and love beyond.

Thank you, brother John, for the opportunity. um as we began to pray for the uh offering and brother Tony said, "Let's begin with praise." I just began to praise the Lord and this came back to me. Something happened to me last night. I was working the yard and then just before like about 8:30 the sun began to go down and with a thunderstorm coming. So I wrapped up all my tooth, put them away, but um had a little assembly to do a chair for my wife. So I said, "Well, I'll just sit here and work on that until the rain comes." So working, it was dark by that time. So just sitting there, open everything out, the screws, everything. Um, and the the bits to turn the the nuts, you know, and then one of the screws and some of the washers fell into the grass. Now, I've had challenges with my eyesight recently. I told the doctor when I went to the I doctor last month, this late earlier this month, he said, "The scan in my eye shows damaged optic nerves." And um the testimony of the man who was born blind just came at the right time for me. He said, "Never from the foundation of the world has someone who was born blind receive sight." Um, and I told that doctor, "Never before, but you will see regenerated optic nerves in my eyes pretty soon." I really believe that. And he looked at me. He said, "You and me both, you know." So, last night, I'm looking for stuff. It's dark. Using my phone. I mean, grass is everywhere. Things fell inside the grass. Um, I couldn't see any. I just something inside me said just say you will you'll find it and something else say by this I know that I have received my healing for my eyes fresh eyesight I don't want to prolong it but God is my judge I found every single piece just like that boom boom boom not one time but then the bit fell into the grass as I pick it up from the package it fell I didn't see where it fell so I took another bit I say well you know the scripture that Jesus said, "I have lost none. I I hate losing things." Jesus doesn't lose anything. So I said, "Lord, I will find it. It's getting late. Minister 10. I'll find it sometime." He said, "No, persist." And sure enough, I just I found that one too. Then another one fell. I said, "Lord, this is too much." But Lord, I believe you. I'm not going to give up. And by God's truth, I found that also. Thank God. Amen. Wonderful. Wonderful. Amen. Amen. Amen. Let's stand this morning. Wasn't it three times with the squirrels with brother Brandham? It's three times with the bits for brother Robert.

I'm going to go through my announcement quickly. on July the 19th. This is the first one coming up. It's our question and answer. I believe it's the third one if I'm not mistaken. Same place, July the 19th. And then on August the 9th, that is the Youngsman meeting. We start courtship part two. Then August the 30th, that's the renewal of vow for brother uh Kelly and sister Joanne. That is 50 years of marriage. Amen. So the whole church is invited. You don't need any official invite, I mean invitation. Just know that you invited, you be there. It's going to be in a hotel, same way uh same facility that we have the married couple meeting. Amen. I believe you already received the date for the married couple meeting. So the married couple meeting by God's grace, the date was open for September the 20th, 20 September 20th for part seven. And then because of the difficulty of the venue, I just anticipated and then we went and booked December the 13th for part 8. So just remember September the 20th and December uh the 13th. So you got like five month and three month to make all your arrangement and everything to be there. Amen. Praise God. Uh sister Lurel's birthday is coming up next week. I believe it's the 4th. And uh the reason why is uh you see what's going on on the ground. We got things laid up left and right. So it's going to be difficult for us to have the fun day for the children going back to school. We don't want anybody to get hurt with the material because the ground is under preparation for construction. So sister Lurel offered up so we can do that at her home. So if you're not having any program, just head to Sister Laurel's home and then we will have some fellowship together and good time. The whole church is invited. You just be there by God's grace and continue to play to pray for the building project. Sometime it's going quickly, sometime it's not depending on on us. We have to wait till we cross all the check mark checkpoint by the city before you move on to the next one. We were trying to get the sheetrock finished, but when we ordered the sheetrock, the order split. So some came on uh Friday and the other one have to come on Monday. So the guy have to come on Tuesday. So everything has been pushed up. So just be patient. God knows everything is working together for good. And I want to apologize that last Sunday I had to take care of certain business after service as a pastor. So you could not wait for me to be there for my wife birthday to cut the cake. So pastor's wife, I mean life is a little bit complicated, but everybody got a cake. So because of that, we have to come back again. [Laughter] Because I want to set up a good example for the children in church knowing that when mama have a birthday, daddy must be there. So you're going to have a second cake today. So sister Joella, those who missed last Sunday, God gave you a double grace. So if you were not there, you got a cake for this Sunday. And those that were there last Sunday, you got a double portion. So, it's for free after service. I'll make sure this time I'm there. I'm I didn't tell her anything. So, I believe in the laws of redemption that you can get you you can redeem yourself and go back to the original position. Amen. So, after service, everybody's invited the cake there. So, I'll make sure to rush quickly and to be there. At least we can sing happy birthday to Sister Sharon. Amen. Oh my god. All the credit we give it to her. Amen. Any problem? Anyway, [Laughter] [Applause] brother Glenn, I believe I got everything covered. By God's grace, I don't want to get in trouble. So, you stay tuned and let's go straight to the reading of the word. This is again, we will pick up where we stopped last Sunday. So, pay attention because we need to dig into this thing. I hope you will allow me to have plenty of time and you would do good. Uh oh because I'm having difficulty with you. Every time I beg you doesn't end up being the same way. So please focus and by God's grace everything is well. So flight attendant prepare for takeoff. My subject this morning is our life journey through Joseph's five garments part 67. Our subject this morning is a thorn in the flesh. A thorn mim. A thorn in the flesh. Now these are the type of lesson if you stop halfway it's a problem. So we got to go all the way. We are going all the way right sister divine all the way. We have to go all the way. So you promise to go all the way. You're not going to get tired. Few people. Let's pray my friend. Heavenly Father, Lord, we are approaching you humbly this morning. Father, we thank you for your grace, for your love, your mercy, and for everything you have been doing for us, Father, this is as far as I can go with the ability you have given me, Lord. Father, but when it comes to speaking to your brother, Father, interpreting the word of God, it's only a supernatural action of the Holy Spirit, Lord, I pray that you move me completely out of the way, please. And may you move the audience also visible and invisible out of the way that you may come down and speak to our soul and bless us Lord. Father revive us Lord. Encourage us Lord and remove every attack from the world of darkness Lord. Father we commit this service unto thy hand. Be the alpha and the omega in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. Let's go to Job chapter 14 again. Glory to God. Praise God. Hallelujah. I hope you slept well, right? Praise God, my friend. We there. Glory to God. Amen. All right. Job chapter 14 verse one. If you dare, you can say, "Amen." Amen. The Bible says a man that is born of a woman, everybody here is born of a woman. The only one The only one that was not born of a woman was Adam and Eve. He's Eve was born from Adam. Let me leave it alone. Amen. Amen. Amen. A man that is born of a woman is of a few days. So our time are very limited. In other words, short leave. Come and full of trouble. You might be seated. So by default, we getting into unchartered territory. We're getting into the world full of trouble. Into a world full of trouble. Amen. So who put us in this world full of trouble? Let's go to Jeremiah 29 verse 11. I'm just coming the same scripture then we take off. Jeremiah 29 verse 11. If you dare, you can say amen. Glory to God. The Bible say, "For I know the thoughts that I think toward you." We clear on that one, says the Lord. Thoughts of peace and not of evil to give you an expected end. Amen. So even though we are in the world full of trouble, nevertheless, the thoughts of God toward us are thoughts of peace, not of evil. Amen. but to give us an an expected end. In other words, a a good end. Let's go to John chapter 9. Praise God. You're moving very fast today. Glory to God. John chapter 9 verse one. If you dare, you can say amen. The Bible says, "And as Jesus passed by, he saw a man which was blind from his birth. And his disciple asked him saying, "Master, who did sin?" We already went through the scripture. "This man or his parent that he was born blind?" Jesus answered, "Neither has this man seen nor his parent." But in other words, the blame is not on a man. The blame is not on his parent. M but we need to find where is the origin of the I mean the cause who who who who started this problem. Amen. He say but that the works of God should be made manifest where in him. So the man was victim of the works of God. Amen. He was victim of the plan of God. Amen. It is the plan of God that open up to this issue this trouble the trouble of his eyes. Amen. In other words, who is the or the the the the the cause? Uhhuh. Of the problem. Uhhuh. It's who? God. God. Being responsible for an illness. Huh? And go preach to this young man. You say God have a good thoughts about you. Thoughts of peace and not on evil. Would you have an amen from that boy? No. I'm just asking you because this is how we behave when trouble comes. when you are going under problem when they say God loves you, you say I guess because you're going through headache. Amen. Amen. But the Bible says the reason why this boy is suffering is because God picked this boy. Uhhuh. God chose this boy. God predestinated this boy to trouble. Uhhuh. Right. Amen. And God will use the trouble to glorify his name. That's right. Yes, sir. There is no ministry greater than the ministry of Jesus Christ. No. And the ministry of Jesus Christ was connected to this boy. Amen. Are we together? Amen. So when God was uh putting together the ministry of Jesus Christ, he also inserted this boy. Amen. So this boy was part of the ministry of Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen. Amen. His testimony will vindicate the Messiah. Amen. You can refine again sister Adasa. Amen. His testimony was connected to the Messiah. Amen. In other words, God needed the testimony of this boy to convince certain people. Uhhuh. So your testimony has a purpose. That's right. The trial you're going through has a purpose. That's right. God is going to use that trial to help somebody else. That's right. And not only to help, even to condemn the Pharisees. Amen. Are we together? Amen. Why only my child? Everybody goes to the hospital, they came up with a child without any problem. Mine came up blind. Oh God, what have I done? What is going on in my life? Have I sinned? Did it not walk in your ways? What have I done? You going to go all along going, claming here, seeking for prophecy everywhere to find out what is going on. What have I done that my child is born that way? Sometime it doesn't have anything to do with you. It doesn't have anything to do with grandfather. You will find witches everywhere. Uhhuh. Maybe was so and so who was in the hospital that day. Maybe was that doctor. You will blame everybody. It's not about it's about God. That's right. Are we together? Amen. Let's go to John 16. Oh, glory to God. Go preach to this family. You say, "God have thoughts of peace." Mhm. And not of evil. Mhm. Will you have an amen? Amen. They will be sitting on me. Amen. Amen. Let's go to John 16:33. Then we take off. If you're there, you can say amen. Amen. I'm warming the engine. These things I have spoken to you, this is Jesus talking. That in me in Christ. Amen. Amen. You might have peace. Remember, so peace is where? In Christ. In Christ. If you're not in Christ, you cannot have this peace. Uh-huh. Amen. Amen. Amen. So make sure you in Christ. Amen. Because there are trouble in this world. This world is full of trouble. Amen. And you need a peace that can stand any trouble. Amen. And that peace is only in Christ. Because Jesus Christ is Jehovah shalom. Amen. He is Jehovah peace. Amen. Are we clear? Amen. Amen. The Bible says, "These things I have spoken to you that in me you might have peace in the world." So there is one of you in Christ. Amen. Amen. And one of you in the world. Amen. Amen. One of you That's right. is in the world. Uh-huh. And one of you That's right. is in Christ. Amen. The one who have peace is the inner man. And he need to stabilize the outer man. Uh-huh. He need to tell the other man, "Chill up." Uh-huh. Quiet. All is well. Uh-huh. That's right. Amen. Amen. So, make sure the inner man is connected in Christ. Amen. Because if he's connected in Christ, then he has peace. Amen. Are we together? Amen. Peace doesn't mean that there is no trouble.

Now, we found last Sunday that Paul was growing in infirmity. Yes, sir. Now, put your seat belt, my friend. We entering the surgery. You did very good. Amen. Amen. But we know that according to the atonement, the Bible says in Matthew 8:16 that when the evening was come, they brought unto him many that were possessed with water, devils, and he cast out the spirit with his word, and healed all that were water. that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Isaiah the prophet saying himself did what? Took our infirmities and bear what? Our sicknesses. Amen. In other words, Jesus is anti-infirmity. Amen. Amen. Jesus doesn't like infirmity. He would take infirmity away from you. Amen. The very atonement remove Amen. And the Bible says in Hebrew 4, for we have not a high priest which cannot be touched with water, the filling of our infirmities, but was in all point tempted like as we are, yet without water. So even Jesus standing on the throne, sitting on the throne there, his anti- infirmity. Amen. But Paul come and Paul say, you know what, I glory in my infirmity. Amen. How can you glory in something Jesus is taken away? Uh-huh. Welcome to the surgery, my friend. Let's go to second Corinthian chapter 11. Oh, glory to God. You've been doing good, so don't slow me, please. If you dare, you can say amen. Amen. Follow me very carefully, my friend. If you dare, you can say amen. Amen. Verse one, it is not expedient for me doubtless to glory. In other words, it's not necessary to boast. Paul already understand that of a truth. It's not good to boast. Paul understand that. But we know the reason why he's boasting because somebody else begin to boast. And Paul say, you know what? We shut our mouth too much. It looks like we are nothing. Let's let let's at least say something so you understand that. Don't worry about what they are boasting. 2 Corinthian 12 verse one. Amen. Amen. It is not expedient for me doubtless to glory. I will come to vision and revelations of the Lord. Remember in chapter 11 he explained everything how he was bigoted and all the apostle and how he suffered for Jesus Christ. Now he reached a point he say now let me boast about vision and revelation. This is what Paul is saying. Amen. Amen. So now I'm going to talk about vision and revelation. He say I will come to visions and revelation of the Lord. I knew a man where in Christ. Notice he is in Christ. Because when brother Brandham was not in Christ, he went to hell. Amen. [Laughter] Is that a problem? No. Is that a problem? No. Jesus went to hell because he died as a sinner. That's right. Uh-huh. Somebody, let me help you. Don't worry. Let me help you. Help me. Let me help you. Don't worry. In the garden of Gethsemane, Uh-huh. the the pillar of fire left him. That's right. That's why he was crying, "My father, my father, why have thou what? Forsaken him." In other words, the father left him. That's right. And the reason why the father left him is because he took your sin. That's right. And my sin, he took the cup and drunk it. That's right. So, so from Gethsemane, Jesus became a sinner. Amen. That's right. Amen. Not the sin he did. No. But the sin he carried. That's right. Amen. Are we together? So when you die as a sinner, Uhhuh. automatically your ticket is toward hell. That's right. But God was working for a purpose. That's right. Because there was no way to send the atomic the B2 bombers. Uhhuh. The bunker buster bomb could not enter hell. And the one who carried that bomb was Jesus Christ. Amen. So we got to find a way to insert Jesus Christ. Amen. As a Messiah agent. Amen. Into the territory of the devil. Amen. So God can flesh Jesus. Amen. As a sinner. Amen. [Applause] I don't know if you understanding me. So when Jesus is coming from her in her the daughter the sinner is coming. That's right. Come on. I don't know if we together.

And when the devil realized he was too late, That's right. Israel already penetrated Iran. Amen. He took the keys of hell. Uhhuh. And the keys of death and kick the devil. That's what brother. That's right. That's what he said. Uh-huh. Are we clear so far? Amen. We clear so far. So when you die as a sinner, you go in where? To hell. Straight to hell. That's why Jesus went to hell. That's right. But the problem is to drop a banker based it then he came out. Amen. And he emptied paradise and he went back up again. Are we together? Amen. Brother Branom was shot by his friend by accident. Then he lost conscience. Then he dropped down to hell. Uhhuh. Because he was not saved yet. That's right. I hope we together. Amen. But when brother was saved, brotherham went to the sixth dimension. That's right. I hope we are together. Amen. So if you are saved, you have no ticket toward hell. That's right. Amen. If anything happen to you, straight to the six dimension. That's right. Amen. Thank you, Lord. Are we together now? We clear so far. Now Paul is saying anoint man. Verse two where? In Christ. In Christ. We clear now. Because to see this thing, you must be in Christ. Amen. If you a sinner, you cannot go there. Amen. Are we together now? Amen. He says, I know a man in Christ above water 14 years ago. Whether in the body, you follow me? Amen. I cannot tell. or whether out of the body. Mhm. If you don't understand clearly, Paul is breaking something there. Yes, sir. Mhm. In other words, a prophet can see vision two ways. Yes, sir. Uh-huh. Amen. Yes, sir. Amen. He can see vision being in his body. Amen. Or sometime the prophet can come out. Amen. Reading the Bible. My friend, the message of brother Brandham is perfectly with the Bible. Amen. That's why brother Brham saw himself coming out. Amen. And he turned around, he saw brother Brham laying there. Amen. But brother Brham is in another dimension talking to the center. Amen.

Where they out of the body? I cannot tell. Who knows? God knows. God knows. Such a one was caught up where? In to the third heaven. So the first experience of Paul, he went to the third heaven. Amen. We will deal with that one day. We started and we stopped. We will deal with that. You will know what is the third heaven. Uhhuh. If the Lord tell you, you will know what is the third heaven. Amen. Because this is where we going. That's right. And you will know what is the third in heaven. You cannot with the message of brother Brandham. cannot enter in heaven and be surprised. No. Even if you die today, Uh-huh. when you go into the sixth dimension, we already have the map. Amen. You will see trees. Uhhuh. You will see a creek. And you know this is the sixth dimension. Uh-huh. Where are you guys? And you will see them coming up. To welcome you. Amen. We have them up, my friend. Amen. Because the seals are broken. Amen. Amen. Are we together? Amen. Let's continue to climb, my friend. That was the first vision. Uh-huh. Verse three. And I knew such a man. Yes. Whether in the body, again, a second experience or out of the body, I cannot tell. What? God knoweth. How he was caught up into what? Paradise. So Paul went to two places. Uhhuh. He went to the third heaven. Then he went to paradise. Amen. This paradise is not the Old Testament paradise. No. Because the Old Testament paradise was done with Jesus Christ. That's right. Jesus Christ removed all the scent and took them to heaven. This is the sixth dimension for us. Amen. Are we together? Amen. Because now we are going with the blood of Christ. Amen. No more the blood of bulls of goat that kept them under Lucifer. Uhhuh. Are we together? Amen. Paul says, "And then I heard water unspeakable words which is not lawful for a man to but brother Brandham told us the conversation and of such a one without glory. So the man that went to heaven is not Paul the physical. No, it's not brother Brandham the physical. I don't know if you're understanding me. Brother Brham said he turned around and he saw himself laying there. But on this side, he was young. Uhhuh. That's what brother Brandham said. Amen. Because he enter his theophony. That's right. Are we together? Amen. So it's a guarantee that brother Brandham is saved. Amen. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Are we together? Amen. Are we together? So Paul is saying, I'm glorying for that person. Amen. Uhhuh. Not this one. Yes, Lord. Amen. the man in Christ, not the man in the world. Follow me, my friend. I'm growing for that man. For that man, I can say big things about him. Amen. I'm going slowly, my friend. This is a heart surgery, my friend. We clear. He said, I will glory of such a one. Yet in myself, you see the flesh. Yes. In Paul, the flesh, yet in my flesh, I will not glory. But by but in my what? infirmities. So Paul is dividing the spiritual man. Uh-huh. Amen. Amen. And the natural man. Amen. When he come to the spiritual man, Paul say, "I will glory." Amen. But when it comes to the natural man, Paul say, "I will glory here about my infirmities." That's right.

Christ Jesus. And so brother Brandham is receive as who? Christ Jesus. Was Paul Jesus Christ? No. Did they worship Paul? So where is the problem? [Music] Amen. He says you receive me as Christ Jesus. Where is then the blessedness you speak of? For I bear you record that if I had been what? Possible. You would have done what? Block out your own eyes. And have done what? Gave them to me.

Hallelujah. Paul, brother, brother say we notice that Paul the great revelation that he heard of Jesus Christ, who he was. He was so great to know. Well, God put it in the Bible. That is how great he was. That is the reason he was given a thorn in the flesh. To keep him how? Down. So he would not get big and exalted. God kept him how? Down. And how? Small. So he can use him in different part of the country. Amen. We moving on my friend. Do for him what he want to because he had the revelation of Jesus Christ who he was. Are we clear? Amen.

So I need to go to the left one. Okay. So brother Steven, you mean that problem are periodic? Me I'm having a hard time understanding this. Let's go to second Timothy. First Timothy 5, please help me so we can go quick. First Timothy 5. Hey, hey, hey. I have an analogy the Lord drop on me. But some of you are super super spiritual. So it's difficult for me to drop it. You know, you need to be careful what you say on the pulpit. Let's go to First Timothy 5. When I do this, it just kind of loosening you up so you can soak what is coming. First Timothy 5:23. If you there, you can say amen. Are we there? Are we there? Are we there? This is the the scripture drunker use. Amen. Amen. To drink. To drink. Like a brother say, "I got two wives, so I need to drink whiskey." Who told you to marry two wives? Polygamy is wrong. [Applause] Brother Brandham say it's a life of a pig. Hallelujah. You get two wife, you deal with them. But polygamy is wrong. Deal with them. Yes. Amen. I'm going to drink whiskey. That's your problem. Soo yourself. Amen. First Timothy 5:23. This is Paul advising Timothy. He said, "Drink what water but use a little water." He was leader. Yours is a whole bottle. Every day. He said, "Drink no longer water but use a little water." Why? for your stomach's sake and your what how are those infirmities the infirmity are so Timothy will get better and after a while Timothy got problem with his stomach why is God not taking that off That's I don't know if we together. Amen. I don't know we together. Amen. Paul looked at him. He said, Timothy, no, no, no, no. Don't continue like this because God is using Timothy a lot. But often Timothy got a problem with his stomach. So that was another buffeting that was given to Timothy to keep the gospel moving. Oh my God. Amen. Paul says this in Romans 5. And not only so, but we glory in what? Tribulations also knowing that tribulation work what? Work it patience. Amen. How can you glory in tribulation? So if you in tribulation, you go see Paul. Paul is laughing. Paul, what happened? Something good to you? Of course, my brother. What happened, man? They put me in jail yesterday. [Music] I don't know if you understanding me. I don't know if you understanding me. What God is showing here is when tribulation come, if you cry, nothing will happen. Hallelujah. I hope you understanding me. But if you change your attitude in the midst of the tribulation, then God come down. Amen. Amen. I hope you understanding me. Because that tribulation is necessary. That's why Paul and Silas were not crying. They have every reason to cry. 100% they should have cried. But when they look Paul remember he say ah Timothy hey don't cry it hurt silence don't cry men you can clap hand right uhhuh go over there to that corner let's go beat the wall let's go [Applause] I'm going to get the glory go when the jailer heard He said, "What kind of people are this?" Everybody that is here is sad, is desperate, but not Paul and Silas. Regardless of the circumstances, they show their color. I don't know if we together. I don't know if we together. Amen. Everybody's crying. It doesn't mean you need to cry. Amen. They have every right to be sad like any prisoner because they were innocent. Those that were there, some of them were guilty. Are we together? But they never look at the circumstances. They begin to glorify God in the midst of trouble. And when you are weak, then he is what? Strong. What did God do? He shook the prison. Yes, sir. Amen. And he saved the jailer and his entire family. So, was going to jail a problem or bad? It was a good problem because God wanted to save that jailer. Amen. Let me continue. He says, "For knowing that tribulation produce what? Patience." So how do you get patience? Tribulation. No tribulation. No patience. Is there any problem? No. So and patience does what? Experience. And experience does what? Hope. And hope maketh what? Not a shame. So to bring forth all these things, you need tribulation. And Jesus say you will have tribulation. Because tribulation is a blessing. Yes sir. When tribulation comes, it comes with a package. If you handle tribulation right, tribulation will be changed into patience. So when tribulation comes, God is bringing you patience. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. I don't have any choice. I have to use this example. Amen. that I say I don't want to say but I don't have any choice because I need to move forward so you need to catch up with me a woman make sure yes a woman when she get to the time of life and she's grown up read between the line when the time of love come and she's grown up. She begin to see her period. It is called period. It's a very uncomfortable time. Yet, it's a blessing. Amen. [Music] Yes, sir. If you don't have it, it's a problem. It is a sign of life.

I hope you begin to understand now. After a while, she begin to get used to it. And she cope to live with it. until you will never know when she's going through that or not. I hope now I together. If you see her, she's always happy. You don't know when she got period or not. This is what God want you to understand. [Applause] Whether you going through problem or not, you don't see it on my face. Amen. I learned to live with it. It become part of womanhood. She take pride on that. Amen. Jesus. That's why Paul say, "I learn to leave when I'm at based." Amen. And when I am full. Amen. I'm fine. The devil, no matter what you're doing, I'm fine. Oh, it's a period. Yes. I'm a woman. I'm working. Amen. It's a blessing. After a while, it's finished. Next back again tomorrow. Amen. This is what Paul is saying. I hope you understand it now. If you stop, you go to the doctor.

No sister say and say remove the you removing life. Are we together now? But I'm going to show you a different way. But if it's an issue of blood, it is no longer periodic. Now we become a disease. That one must go. I'm going to get you to that. I'm going to get you to that. Yes, sir. If it become an issue of blood, don't accept it anymore. We're going to get to that. Lord, help me. Paul says, "For our what? Affliction. Light affliction which is but for a what? A moment." Periodic.

So this devil that bothers me is a water growing pain of water your grace then I will glory on water in my infirmity. Why if lest I get exalted above the abundance of water the revelation? See he had something the other disciple didn't have. Yes. He saw him after his death, burial, resurrection, and what? He saw him. Some of them say, "Well, I walk with him."

Sufficient. Listen to brother Brham about his life. Brother Brham say then I glory in my infirmities. Then when I am weak I'm what? strong as long as it is to the will of God. All right. Now, I consulted him one time when he used to bother me so bad. He scared me. He told me about 8 or 10 years ago. He said, "He shall never scare you again." And he never has did. No, sir. Don't worry about it. I just feel it, but I know it's there. But I just go on because it don't scare me no more. So thankful for that. So brother Brandham had a problem himself. Amen. That used to bother him all the time. And brother Brandham pray God and God did not remove it. No. God said no. Brother Brandham that thing is going to be there but don't be scared of it. Amen. In other words, continue living your life. Amen. Don't worry about it. It is necessary. Are you there? Amen. Brother say he could have say he won't be no more. Just all is well. You won't be scared no more. In other words, God could have taken away from brother Brandham. But God say William Brana don't take that one away. That one just know it won't scare you. You continue your life, brother. Continue your life with a demon. So it is his will that it happen. So adjust do what? Embrace it and say, "Thank you, Lord. I walk walk that way." Amen. Just like a woman is walking that way. Without being bothered by her circle, that's the same way you need to walk. And brother Bradam says this. He says everywhere through every n through nation every time I have a turn in the flesh everywhere brotherham going he had a problem brother say an angel of Satan who follows and tried to buffet or to be set but he has been defeated how many cases in every case by what? The Holy Spirit and God come out and do what? triumphant winning 100,000 of Christ 100,000 to Christ in the time brother say everywhere he was going to preach the gospel he had the throne in the flesh but if you notice every time the throne come God will come and heal him because it is there to buff it blow after blow you get healed it come back again you get healed it come back again. Now we have a problem with this brother of Stephven. We pray for people to get sick. I mean to get healed. We pray we casting out devil from people. Now you brought us something that is very uh unique. Not to mention strange that there are problem in our life that we need to just accept and walk with it. So now, how am I going to know that this is a turn or this is not a tone? Amen. Are we together? Amen. How am I going to know that this sickness here, it is God giving me sickness? Oh, this is not from the Lord. Because now I'm confused. I'm going through a trial right now. Yes, sir. But you're saying certain things you just need to swallow it up and just leave them alone and keep walking. But by the same token, we need to pray for the sick. We need to cast our devil. So the problem is who can tell me what is a tone or what is not a tone. Buckle up and I'll go to the airport. If you ready, you holler. Amen. Amen. Few people, my friend. Amen. A few people again. Amen. Ah, now you ready? Number one, a thorn is periodic. Are we together? Amen. A thorn is periodic. It is seasonal. It is never permanent. Are we together? Amen. And every time a turn come, are we together? Amen. God will heal you. Amen. Amen. When you pray for it and it will go away. Are we together? Amen. Then it will come back again. This month you might have cramping. You might go through pain. You might need some Tylenol. God can take that pain away, but next month the circle will come again. I hope we together. Amen. Amen. Amen. Time are periodic, seasonal, not permanent because God will heal you. Amen. Amen. Number two, it is God who determine what is atone. Amen. Not you. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Yes, sir. Amen. Let me go back again. Paul didn't determine his turn. Yes, sir. It is God who gave Paul that say the Lord. Amen. And say this is me. If God didn't tell you, don't take it. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. It must be It must be that saith the Lord. Amen. Amen. If not, the devil will play with your mind. Why are you saying that, brother Steven? Brother Brandham says this. Now I'm heading to the airport. I will admit there is sickness unto death. Uhhuh. And that is why prophetic gift are in the church to know these things. But to say that our father that a man had rumatism arthritis say yes lord I'm just glad to have it. Glad you give it to me. I embrace it. I love it. I glory in tribulation. I'm now trying to help you, my friend. Break it down. Are we together? If I leave you going up, you will say, "I take this thing. I embrace it." Brother Steven said they are certain. Number one, it must be periodic. Number two, it must be that safe the Lord. If God didn't say anything, Amen. Don't start confessing. Amen. Amen. Can I continue? Amen. Can I continue? Amen. Brother Bradam say Paul stone in the flesh was no more diseased than nothing else. If he was not healing, he got well. And he said the messenger of the devil that buffet me. What does the word buffet means? Blow after what? Blow. See, then he heal him. He got well. He healed him again. He got sick. And he healed him. He got sick. Blow after blow. He said a messenger of Satan. Not an infirmity as he meant as he said there, but as people tried to interpret it. Brother said, don't take that as the word infirmity because the atonement remove infirmity. I I hope you are now understanding. Amen. It is a thorn, something periodic, but God will heal you anytime it happen. Amen. Are we together? Amen. Brother Brandham says, "I will let brother Bster take that thorn in the flesh for you some afternoon." And some of these what teachers? Brother Brandham say that people are using this scripture, Paul, to begin to say, "Oh, I'm I'm having diabetes. Oh, praise the Lord. That is my turn in the flesh. I'm having arthritis. Oh, praise the Lord. That is my turn in the flesh. But said, "No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no." He said, "That's not the way it's taken." He said it was not an infirmity. Amen. It was not something permanent. It was something that comes and God heal you and it goes away. Amen. It was an allergy that come and hit you and the allergy goes. But if that allergy continues on and it doesn't go away, you need to wake up. Amen. I hope we are together. Amen. What brother say? What is disease? He say what this dreadful thing that come upon people. Let's diagnose it just a moment. Some people has went has went so much to say that sickness was a blessing. because of this scripture. Amen. Amen. I'm I'm I'm balancing now everything back. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Are we together? Amen. Oh, brother Stephen. So, it's a turn in my flesh. So, it's a blessing. Brother Brandham say are we together? Amen. Oh my god. Everybody's now calm. We heading to the airport. Brother Brandham say some people has went so much to say that what sickness was a blessing. I heard a minister on the radio here not long ago say that God put sickness on people to show their humility. Now you're not saying amen. Are we together? Amen. Why? Because Paul say I glory in the infirmity. Paul is a different thing. It's a periodic thing. It is not a permanent sickness. Amen. I hope we are together. Amen. He says he said that God put sickness onto people to show their humility and to suffer for him to show patience. If that will be the truth, then Jesus defeated his own cause. Amen. He defeated what? His own purpose. Never one place in the Bible is that scriptural. Amen. Amen. Any apostle or any prophet or even Jesus himself ever declared that to be the truth. That is negative thinking. Amen. Amen. Amen. Brother Steven, slow down. You say God put a devil Yeah. To buffet people, to keep them humble like he did Paul. Paul pray, he goes. He comes back again. He goes, he come back again. The point is it's going. It's going. He have to go. Then when he come back again, you go back again. You cast it away. He comes back again. But nothing to stay. Amen. Amen. Amen. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Are we together? Nothing to stay. In other words, your body cannot receive any permanent sickness. Amen. Yes, sir. I don't know if you getting me. If somebody begin to draw you that way, that's a problem. Amen. Because the atonement is there. I am the Lord your healer. [Applause] Amen. Are we together? Amen. Uh-huh. Brother Brandham say that is negative thinking and you are only trying to excuse your unbelief. A preacher who doesn't have faith to cast out devil now he begin to say you know there is a turn in the flesh you need to take the tone in the flesh brother you need the Holy Ghost to cast devil amen the tone in the flesh the one who have the tone will cast that tone away amen are we together amen he says that is an excuse for your unbelief, preacher, by hiding behind such a what theory as that. That is not God's word. What we need today is what old fashioned God send what back to the water Bible and the baptism of the Holy Ghost preaching the water of Jesus Christ to bring the people back to a water living faith and a resurrected God. Not some dead theology that has been gone what years ago and hatch off of different denomination. We need a Bible living faith. [Applause] Are we together? Amen. Are we together? And if sickness is a blessing and Jesus come and heal the sick everywhere that he defeated his purpose in coming. Which would you which would you say would be a blessing? If a loving God, a father who gave you life and promise you a long life on earth if you obey him, then he would come and strike you down with a devil and let's lay there and eat you up on the bed with cancer. No way. That's not a turn. Are we together? Amen. TB, that's not a turn or something. Say now, oh God, this is your love to me. Or would you rather say the devil struck me down and a loving God came and did what? Healed me. And give me what? Life again. Why a child will know better than to say that God put sickness on people? Don't never pin that on God. Amen. Amen. Amen. Are we together? Amen. Are we together? Amen. How do I know it's a turn? Yes, Lord. Periodic. But I must be healed. And God must tell me Yes, sir. That is my turn. If God didn't tell you, it's your turn. Hallelujah. Pull the sword. Amen. I don't know if you're understanding me. If God didn't tell you put your it's it's a tone. If I'm having something and you come, you say, "Okay, brother Stephen, you got this because God want to humble you. That's your problem. Me, I'm going to pull this. until God tell to me if not that thing must go. Yes sir. Brother say Jesus never did tell his disciple never preach at anywhere or ask the disciple to tell people they must stay pinned down with sickness to obey him. No sir never today this thing is clear. Amen. He sent them to liberate the sickness and to preach to those where captivity. In captivity and to those in what? Bondage. He come to bring what? Deliverance. And he can bring deliverance. He can do the two things opposite one from another. He's either got to be the author of life or the author of water. Yes. And if he and if you put and if and if you put sickness onto God and say if if that is God making you sick to die then you got to make him the author of death when death and life cannot associate how? Even together. Are we together? Amen. We getting somewhere my friend. Disease and affliction are all the result of what? Sin. Maybe not in your life but in somebody else life before you. The devil is the altar of what? Sickness and water. Affliction. Before we had any devil, we had no sickness or affliction. But when Satan came, he brought with him water. Sickness and water. Affliction. There is so many times that we refer to them as blessing. I never could think that God could get a blessing out of a sick person. Amen. Unless he was what? A sinner. Driving him what? To God. or a disobedient child bringing him back to be reconciled to what? His father. But sicknesses are the result of the devil and of the fall. Amen. Amen. Amen. Are we together? Amen. Are we together? Amen. We getting my friend. I found a lot of people that say that sickness is a blessing. Ask some doctor if it is. Why is it then you go if you got your appendicitis and have the blessing cut out? It's a tone in my flesh. It's a tone in my flesh. So you the one diagnosing the tone. So why do you go to the doctor to remove the tone? Your best. Are we together? Amen. As sure would not want to do that. That is against your own theory. Have the blessing cut out. I would not want to do that. I just kept it. And what? God. See, but sickness is no blessing. Sickness is what? A curse of the devil. And Jesus say it was what? All right. Now, here it is. A man one time in South Africa. All right. Where we was having a meeting at the Dutch Reform Church. He stood up. First the pepper blasted everywhere. But when they found out that the member become so spiritual when they went back they haul a water. Amen. So member that are spiritual hauler what? Amen. Some are not non-spiritual. Those that are spiritual haul what? Amen. They holler. Amen. In church and everything they thought that then he got fanatical. Amen. So he went to church and say, "Talk about such a blessing. How the Lord blessed the people with sickness." And the man's wife a couple days later they had a pandicadness, rush her to the hospital and cut the blessing out. Why? Yes. If such a blessing to be sick, if it's such a blessing to be sick, let her go and be sick. Don't do nothing about it. You be doing something God would not want you to do. If it's such a blessing to have a cancer, why take radium, chemo or anything? Just let it go and be a blessing. If you are more blessed when you are dead and you can do more for the Lord when you are dead than when you are alive, well, go ahead and die. But God want you here to fulfill his program. Amen. [Applause] Are we together? Amen. Are we together? Amen. The Bible say above what? All things. I will that you do what? Prosper in hell. And be in what? In health. Above all things that you prosper in what? Health. the rathers of the scripture inspired by the Holy Spirit which the scriptures say all scripture is given by inspiration of God. Amen. So what do we do now my friend as a conclusion it is to him that believe and if he can find somebody who will uh who will believe his word he will prove his word by you this is after the seal and sometime sickness and thing happen to us that way that God can prove himself that's good amen John nine my friend do you remember the blind Amen. That Jesus found they say who sin he or his father his mother he said in this case neither but that the what works of God may be made known. See it happened to the boy so that Jesus could be glorified. Sometime sickness is not a curse. It is what a blessing. That we must. It is not a blessing for you to accept and begin to tell the people I'm blessed with cancer. No, no, no, no. It's a blessing for a reason. Yes, sir. And what is that reason? Amen. Brother Brandham say it's a blessing that we can do what? Stick our faith out there and call those things which are not as though what they were. So when sickness come to your life, God is trusting in your faith. Amen. I don't know if you understanding me whether it's a tone or it's not a tone. Every time sickness happen to your life, it is an opportunity that God is giving to your faith. It is the trial of your faith. God is trying your faith. Amen. God want you to exercise your faith. Whether it be a turn or not turn, he must go. Amen. That's right. Amen. It is a blessing that we can do what? Stick our faith out there. Out there and call those things which are not as though what they were. God said so and he shall prove it so if you suggest not weaken under the water. First, let's go to 2 Corinthian and let's finish. 2 Corinthian 12 and let's finish now. Attendant, prepare for landing. Amen. Amen. Now everybody's clear. Amen.

You send you send. You send. So it's not a problem. Devil coming up. Amen. And I'm and I'm expecting again when it's coming back. It's not going to stay in my life. Amen. Not in my wife, not in my child, not in my home, not in my business, because it's an opportunity. It is the exercise of your faith. Amen. The more you exercise, the more muscle.
