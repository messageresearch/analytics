reading your cod book church ages okay praise god we're doing good there just remembered our house meeting brother robert it's on may the 21st brother kelly right may 21st our house meeting so you still have more than a month to make your preparation amen whenever you're ready i don't know if brother robert is around here i don't see him yet yeah we need him back here and when you're ready up there we can go ahead and mute and i'm going to mention something and then we go back up again into the into our sermon amen so those that are streaming if you're not here and you want to know what it was all about you need to talk to the deacon amen and feel free if you part of this church and talk not me new to youtube i hope everything will stay easy [Applause] the lord is coming somebody needs a clean up mess somebody needs to clean up their lives amen hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord if you back on youtube you can thank you very much everybody here amen blessed be the name of the lord let's go to jeremiah 31. this is pretty deep it's heavy but i put a lot of core material today and lord's willing than when we get to ruth on the wesley it's gonna flow easily and you will understand it amen and i want you to stay awake because this is the biggest trouble in the message i know what i'm talking about the biggest trouble in the message if you dare you can say amen jeremiah chapter 31 verse 31 give me a little bit of grace because i cannot rush with this if any error goes here you're locked again in the old system so i have to go slowly a lot of asteroids amen jeremiah 31 31 if you dare you can say amen behold the days come says who the lord that i will make a new covenant with the house of israel and with the house of judah you might be seated if god is willing or wanted to make a new covenant that means that there is already another covenant existing you cannot make a new covenant if there is not an old covenant everybody so the promise here that god is giving israel is a promise of a new covenant do your best not to miss anything i know what i'm talking about verse 32 not according to the covenant that are made with their father brother kelly because it's very easy when you change the covenant the people have a tendency to carry the things from the old covenant into the new covenant everybody so god wanted to make sure that this new covenant will be something totally new it will be completely different he has nothing pretty much to do with the old covenant everybody okay so far he said not according to the covenant that are made with their father so there was a covenant that already existed it's an old covenant that was made with the fathers everybody okay and what else what does the covenant say he say not according to the covenant that are made with their fathers in the day that i took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of egypt which my covenant they did water so the first covenant man was not able to keep it man was unable unable to keep it everybody care men broke the covenant everybody okay blessed be the name of the lord he says although i was a husband to them let me read it over again i don't want you to say brother stephen's saying verse 32 not according to the covenant that are made with their fathers in the day that i took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of egypt which my covenant they did what they broke although i was a heart so israel was a what am i reading a different bible so this covenant god say in that covenant i was a husband the husband was god was crossed because christ was following them he was the rock everybody okay now and the wife was israel so it's a covenant of a husband and wife i won't preach on marriage now today maybe on the wesley then i'll dig into it everybody here amen although i was a husband to them say the lord everybody here so far verse 33 but this shall be the covenant the new one that i will make with the house of israel after those days say the lord what is the covenant i will put my law in there let's go slowly give me your time according to the old confidence they hear the law everybody okay this will help you forever in this message or you're going to have a trouble with this message in the old covenant they had a law and the law was written where young people i want to hear your voice on what on stone everybody okay so if they ask you where is the law [Music] am i okay but this new covenant god said it is not like this old one everybody okay i'm still your husband you are still my wife but this covenant i'm gonna put that i'm gonna take my law everybody okay i'm gonna take my law so there is still a law the law have not changed the new covenant the new covenant still have the law but the law god is putting that in your insider in the inward part do you know what that is what the heart why does he put that on the heart why why not on the stone your eyes are open right i will put that covenant in your inward part and i will and will do what so the first law has some writings amen so the second law also have some writings anybody care they're wrote on stones but this one they are riding away in heart how can you write in the heart so bring you surgery pull your heart open it right right right sewing pulling back put you on icu how many surgery am i gonna do amen i will put them in a in the inward part and write it in their heart and i will be there and there will be my i will be their god and there will be my water a covenant between god and his people god and people your god will be my god and your people [Music] did you get it did you get it did i love somebody your god will be my god and your people will be my people a covenant between god and the people everybody okay so far praise be the name of the lord verse 34 and in this covenant they shall teach no more every man why do we need a preacher then it's a different teacher everybody here they shall teach no more every man he's and every man his brother saying no the lord they don't come to tell you hey you need to know the lord everybody care not the lord for they shall all know me everybody care from there to there say the lord i will forgive their water and i will remember the sin do you love that covenant so if you have done something even if it's in the record of the prison if you ask god god doesn't remember god doesn't even know when you did it let's go to ezekiel chapter 11. i promise to you this now it's inserted you ready ezekiel chapter 11 i wish everybody was here and i'm recommending whoever is not here to make sure they listen to this because if you continue that's your problem ezekiel 11 verse 18 if you dare you can say amen and they shall come there and they shall take away all the the detestable things thereof and all the abomination thereof from there these people that are coming up need to clean up everybody and i will give them one heart even though it's many members but it's one heart many members body but it's one heart that's why paul said i want you to speak one language on the day of pentecost they were in one accord one heart it's a broad one made of many people one heart anybody care i will give them one heart harmony unity and i will put my new spirit a new spirit within them so god is saying here there are people that will come up and clean with all kind of dirty stuff when they come to me number one i'm gonna give them a heart everybody okay and number two i'm gonna give them a new spirit so those people must have an old spirit anybody care verse 19 i will give them one heart and i will put a new spirit within you and i will take the water oh i thought the law was written on what brother michael if you press your heart right here like this and they do cpr is it a stone everybody here so there is a stony heart a heart of stone anybody care a heart very soft gentle sweet but stone you can beat on it nothing happened but when you talk to them sweet everybody here and i would take the stony heart out of their flesh so god is coming to these people with all kind of uncleanness and god make a surgery and when he makes a surgery number one he get into your heart in stone take it away and back here and do a heart transplant everybody okay and then take your spirit away and do a spirit transplant hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord and i will give them a heart of flesh so this heart here is a heart of flesh i thought you already have the heart of flesh god is calling that a stone what you call flesh god say it's a stone everybody clear verse 20 that what is the purpose that i may walk that they may walk in my statute and keep my ordinances and do them and they shall be mine and i will be there so the purpose of this big surgery changing your heart changing your spirit is for you to be able to do the commandment of god i thought you're already doing the commandment of god the purpose is for you the purpose is for you to do the law to do the will of god so with the stony heart it is impossible for you to do the will of god did i lose anybody let's go to ezekiel 18. this is hard stay awake ezekiel 18 verse 30. if you dare you can say amen verse 30 you need to review this at home therefore i will judge you oh israel everybody care i will judge you or house of israel everyone according to his way say the lord repent you remember where we are in the tabernacle and turn yourself from all your transgression so iniquity shall not be your rule god is asking to repent we know the repentance we had the brazen altar everybody okay verse 31 cast away from you all your transgression whereby ye have transgressed and make you a new water so this heart is not just a heart of flesh but it's a new heart of flesh everybody okay make you a new heart how can i make myself a new heart god have to give it to me make you a new heart and a new water for why will you die o house of israel for i have no pleasure in the death of him that dies say the lord god wherefore turn yourself and leave you a new heart a new spirit i promise this to you now it's time to insert it let's go to ezekiel chapter 36 be gracious to me we gotta go somewhere ezekiel chapter 2 36 verse 23 if you dare you can say amen lord help me and i will sanctify my great name which was profane among the hidden which you have profane in the midst of them and the hidden shall know that i am the lord say the lord god when i shall be sanctified in water god being sanctified in us before their eyes for i will take you from among the hidden you are among the hidden i'm gonna come and rescue you from among the hidden justification i'm picking you up everybody okay and gather you out of all countries and bring you into your own land roof taken from moab now back again to israel anybody okay then i will sprinkle water remember when they justify you they're picking up a glass that is dirty so they're bringing a glass that is dirty but you already justify but you need a cleansing so when they bring you into the land of judah you just don't go in the land of judah and get married slow down god have to spray some water on you i will sprinkle clean water god wanna use water remember this clean water why because somebody is filthy they already picking you up you already justified but you're still dirty remember that okay that's why i keep saying how many are up with the sermon because i know anybody here then i will sprinkle clean water upon you and you shall be clean so what cleans you is the water that god is sprinkling upon you after he already picked you up from the heathen everybody okay amen and you shall be clean from all your water you understand sanctification now from your filthiness and from all your adults will i cleanse you verse 26 a new water also without water not only am i cleaning you but remember i gotta do this surgery it's very important a new heart will i give you and a new water will i put within you and i will take away the stony heart you remember now out of your flesh and i will give you a heart of water and i will put my spirit now it's number three everybody okay now number three it is my spirit not the spirit of the pastor but the spirit of god so god number one have to give you a new heart pick you up bring you in clean you give you a new heart which is a heart of flesh and not a heart of stone after the new heart they give you a new spirit and after the new spirit then they give you the spirit of god how many have the holy ghost you see the trouble in the message everybody care and i will put my spirit within you after you receive the new heart after you receive the new spirit then god put the new his spirit on you god don't just bring the holy ghost we gave too much people holy ghost in the message and before you know it they bite you ouch you look it looks like the wolf thief i will put my spirit within you and cause you you don't do it anymore cause you to walk in my statute and you shall keep my judgment and do them and you shall dwell in the land that i gave to your father and you shall be my and i will be your i will also save you from all your uncleanness and i will call for the corn and will increase it and lay the no famine upon you and i will multiply the fruit of the tree the tree and the increase of the field that you shall receive no more reproach of famine among the heathen last one luke chapter 5 in other words you clear now by ezekiel through scripture you need a new heart you need a new spirit and you need the spirit of god everybody and according to jeremiah there is two covenant a covenant written on stone and a covenant written in the heart everybody okay luke chapter five if you dare you can say amen verse 36 then we pray and he spoke also a parable to them no man put a piece of a new garment upon an old if otherwise they both the new makes a rent and the piece that was taken out of the new agrees not with the old there is no agreement you can mix the two together everybody okay verse 37 and no man put new wine you remember the one no man put new one into old water you know who that bottle is right right that's why they have to give you a new a new bottle anybody okay because if they put the new one in the old border you go pentecostal [Music] everybody okay if they put a new one into all the bottle else the new one will burst the border they don't agree everybody okay and be water spill and the border shall do what but new wine must be put into new water and both are water any question so far we clear so far blessed be the name of the lord now let's pray heavenly father lord we are approaching you humbly this morning father thanking you for your grace your love and your mercy and everything you have been doing for us lord we have done what any man that you give an ability to do can do is to open the word of the bible read them lord but when it comes to translating the word interpreting bringing lord the revelation from the word he only takes the action of the holy spirit lord i am not the holy spirit i am just one of the recipient of the holy spirit father may you move me completely out of the way may you come and speak to your children and minister to this church in a supernatural way lord in the name of jesus christ be the alpha and the omega we seal everything that is contrary to your word away from this place in jesus precious name amen blessed be the name of the lord hebrew terrier verse 14 the bible say follow peace with all men and holiness without which no man shall you want to see god what do you need any question my subject this morning is the four phases of roof roof under sanctification you put your seat belt and we go you ready all right when we look into the tabernacle we are talking about a story of a woman that was a gentile that was living in a gentile country and that woman was brought into israel and integrated completely into the royal lineage of israel until the trace of roof cannot be seen anymore everybody okay and that story was not a jewish woman but a gentile woman and paul says in the book of romans that noah not as though the word of god has taken non-effect for they are not all israel which are of israel in other words not everybody that lives in the country of israel that is born under the lineage of abraham is a child of god anybody here paul say neither because they are the seed of abraham are their children but in isaac shall that seed be called in other words the children of the promise that is there which are the children of the flesh the jews these are not the children of god anybody here so you can be born naturally speaking you are a jew or an israelite anybody care and somebody is born and naturally speaking he's a gentile amen whatever the other appearances doesn't matter to god anybody care what mother to god is what is inside of you anybody here you might be a gentile on the outside but you are a jew on the inside anybody here oh you can be a jew on the outside but on the inside you are a gentile everybody here by passport of israel you are a jew but by passport of heaven you are not a jew anybody okay anybody okay so that's why paul is saying that they which are the children of the flesh here are not the children of god but the children of the promise are counted for seed in other words god had children scattered everywhere all over the world anybody care he only picked israel as an example of something but not everybody that is in israel was a child of god the children of god were scattered all around because according to matthew 13 there is a parable that a man went sowing seed and the bible said the field was the world so the children of god was scattered all around some job in america some job in europe some job in australia some job in india some job in africa all over the world ever here but god now is looking for those children not children by flesh but children on the inside everybody that's why they can bring somebody outside they try to put him on israel and they reject him anybody here you remember them in the book of hosea solomon went to marry women and brought them rejected from god but when they bring roof cleanly seen agenda when the hook jew roof automatically roof enter and sit down not on in the congregation of israel only but in the royal line [Music] in the very land that jesus christ must come they insert a roof there and she feed it they put rahab they inserted her and she faded they took bathsheba they put her inside and defeated these are the children of god on the inside not the outside everybody okay so far i am climbing the bible says that other sheep jesus is speaking i have which are not of this fold in other words they are not jewish them also i must bring they shall hear my voice and they shall be the church both jews and gentiles into with how many shepherds in john 11 the bible say and disspect he not of himself but being high priest that ear he prophesied that jesus should die for that nation israel and not for that nation only but that he should gather together in the children of who that will water that's why sometimes a naomi have to leave and when she leaves she hooked you a roof and bring roof back with her and put her in israel everybody here in other words in other words roof was a jew inwardly that's why she could say my people your people will be my people everybody here that's not this flesh speaking that's the inside man that is talking everybody here so far blessed be the name of the lord so we found out that as she went through her journey into the tabernacle we are in the holy place where roof is under sanctification now roof in the holy place meets roof on the roof serving hey mark here it means roof under sanctification anybody care it means roof under wesley and he also means roof under armenianism we already talked about the raw holy place we talked about roof serving now today we are in roof under sanctification everybody cares so far brother branham says this that roof serving is roof making herself ready and to make herself ready is what is called sanctification making yourself ready for what everybody cares so far brother branham said why didn't these other men wesley luther and those great reformers who brought out justification sanctification the pentecostal age with the baptism of the holy spirit and things why they didn't catch these messages why didn't they get them because they were reformers brother bonham said but this the reason that all destroying ends of the mysterious part of justification the mysterious part of sanctification the mysterious part of the baptism of the holy ghost in other words whatever luther preached luther missed some mysteries wesley missed some mysteries the pentecostal miss a mystery and because of those mysteries that were missed that's why we are in the mess that we are in today everybody okay so far as we continue in our journey we found out that in the tub and alcohol we have six furniture and roof have to interact to interact with all six furniture everybody okay when she entering she needs to meet the president although she got to repent repent completely remember that she was a sinner and christ died from her and from there she's gonna move into the baptism everybody okay once she complete those two she finished the message of luther anybody care but because of the mysterious part that luther missed on the justification calvin made a mess by taking grace into disgrace then as you continue to move you move on to the golden candlestick but the candlestick will project you to the table of the showbread everybody over there you reach the plateau of wesley everybody okay so far but because of the loose end westlake turned into armenianism everybody okay then the pentecostal opened up with seymour and the restoration of the gift and because of the missing the mysterious part we ended up with billy graham and oral robert until we reach the message of the hour where we're dealing with the pinner of fire originally back again in church just like he started with paul [Music] anybody here because paul had the seed and you must end up also with the seed and paul had the pillar of fire and you must end up again with the pillar of fire that's why brother branham say i preach like everybody okay so far everybody okay so far so you stay with the green but be careful of the red because justification made way to water sanctification made way to water and the baptism of the holy ghost made way to water any question so far did i lose somebody did i lose somebody hallelujah let's wipe our table so roof is interacting here then over there then right here then goes up then here then over there let's go to roof chapter two oh my friend we had a wonderful service on wednesday amen that was heaven down you don't want to go home everybody care let's go to ruth chapter two if you there you can say amen verse two everybody okay i'm gonna repeat three times please pay attention please pay attention you on the streaming put your coffee stuff down please pay attention whatever border you have or something because you home get it off everybody okay if i lose you i already told you amen ruth chapter two watch out verse two and roof de mor bytes say to nahomi let me go to the field and glean ears of corn after him in whose eye i shall find water and she said to her go my daughter roof completed her journey of the other court she made her decision she said when you die i'm gonna be die when you are buried i'm gonna be buried in other words i'm talking about the death the burial and the resurrection of jesus christ she already been baptized completely now ruth is in the promised land everybody cares so far now in the promised land suddenly she moved by the law everybody okay everybody okay because god has a social service in israel ever here and the social service was to take care of the poor people and those that are widows that if they don't have something to eat they have a free social service whatever you planting on your field they have the right to enter in there and eat what they eat but they don't take anything home if you need the scripture see me after church ever here that social service also provided for the widows that if you are gleaning your field and as you picking up your shift if something drop don't take it leave it for the poor people the beggar and those that are on the pro those that are deprived completely that was god's social security that was provided by the law everybody okay so roof in the land move or enter the field of boards by law the entrance of roof into the field of boaz was by law it was the law that gave her permission to go and to glean anywhere she wanted to everybody okay so far everybody okay so far blessed be the name of the lord job to verse 7. this is the chief reaper speaking and she said i pray you let me glean and gather after the reaper among the chiefs so she came and has continued even from water so roof under the law came in the morning everybody here and she woke up to midday everybody here and suddenly at midday boaz entered the field everybody okay so far blessed be the name of the lord job to verse eight then say bow ask the roof hear you not my daughter go not to glean in another field neither go from here but abide here fast by the water when boaz met roof number one bowers begin to give roofs instruction all commander roof entered the field of boards by law this law was the law of moses everybody but when roof met bowers bowers gave roof a different instruction a different law anybody here there is a new law from boaz everybody here and the new law say stay here don't go anywhere stay with my maidens everybody here everybody here when roof was cleaning from the morning until the time boaz met her her gleaming was under fear and her gleaning was under complex everybody okay because roof said why do you look at me i'm a stranger complex everybody care and when she when she's working she's working with the mindset of a stranger in another field she doesn't know how they're gonna treat her maybe the reaper turn and look and see back up a little bit i'm sorry sir i'm sorry sir everybody okay so when boys came everybody here everybody okay bowers did not stop roof from working everybody okay the new instruction of boaz we're removing whatever was uncomfortable for roof let's jump to verse nine let your eyes be on the field that they do whip not only do i want you to stay here i also need your focus here focus here don't go on youtube and watch any kind of thing everybody here focus here everybody here because the field you going will make a difference it will make a difference on your behavior it will make a difference on your health it will make a difference on your complex it will make a difference on your life you become what you eat [Applause] if you eat mcdonald's every day you're gonna become mcdonald [Music] if you eat healthy you will become healthy so you gotta watch what you are eating on youtube everybody okay so far jump to verse nine let your eyes be on the field that they do rip and go you after them everybody care have i not charged the young man that they shall do what in other words no molestation here everybody here in other words is giving roof security everybody here don't be afraid of men here of young men don't be afraid of them so if in the morning roof was gleaning like this in the afternoon roof begin to glean like this everybody okay let's go down and when you are thirsty this is a poor a widow that came in just to glean me back here when you are thirsty go to the vessel and drink of that witch there have water so who become the servant of who do you follow me in other words is changing the concept of the mind set of roof are you reading between the land in other words those people that you see there i don't want you to be afraid of them they are your servant [Applause] everybody here the reapers are your servant anybody care they are not your boss [Music] [Applause] even though you're gleaming after them they are not your boss [Applause] they are the ones sweating on the pulpit because of you [Applause] [Music] you have a right when it's sunday go to church and sit in church and drink water that they have been working on them he is the one that didn't sleep at night you went to sleep and you wake up in the morning and you are just enjoying whatever the people was working on them you don't know who you are [Applause] [Music] here the day the bride will know who she is [Music] [Applause] ever here ever here you will stop from going after the preachers this minister this minister this minister this minister get away from that all right so and so then yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah everybody they saw it so that everybody there they are your servants [Applause] [Music] if you want one coming here just pray [Music] [Applause] there was a sister in this church that was praying god saying why doesn't brother stephen call brother angel glover and then on wednesday guess what who showed up who brought andrew glover here brother stephen [Music] brother stephen just sat down and something said andrew glover but he was not brothers even in his roof [Music] [Applause] [Music] hallelujah everybody okay so far i'm still climbing my friend keep your seatbelt pretty good everybody care verse 10. and she fell on her face and bowed to herself to the ground and say to him why have i found favor find grace in your eyes that you should take knowledge of me seeing i am complex everybody here boaz say listen carefully verse 11. and boast answer and say to her he has fully been showed me all that you have done to your mother-in-law since the death of your husband and how you have left your father and mother in the land of your nativity in other words whatever you did at the brazen altar amen i already accepted it amen anybody here but i don't want you to move from the brazen altar into the holy place in fear [Music] his brother robert tyrande are you following me you don't enter the holy place like the other priests were entering that death can strike them i don't want you to do that i am here myself i don't want you to enter this next step with complex i don't want you to enter sanctification with fear [Music] i don't want you to enter sanctification with complex the law was a school master but he was only bringing you to something i am here everybody okay so far everybody okay so far hallelujah job to verse 1914 and boa said to her at meal time you remember this on sunday this man didn't stop about staying here stay

get it yet boaz take the bread in front of the repair come on and say take it what is telling the reaper because he already told the reaper don't touch him in front of the reaper in the face in your face boaz is doing this if your boss is doing that to a woman are you gonna play with that woman anymore you know what it means like you can get fired easily because of that woman only texts if she get mad your job is finished everybody care no matter how good of an employee you were years ago a man was a good employee for the young man but esther could take heaven and bring her down [Music]

my bread whether the people like it or not whether you like it or not i am what he made me to be and i'm gonna enjoy the blessing he's giving me whether you like it or not [Music] [Applause] i'm just going to be me man i need to dig deeper somebody's pulling harder amen amen verse 15 and when she was risen up to glean boaz commanded his young man saying let her clean where among the water and do what so now roof have a right not only to do this but when the reaper is getting something and going roof can go there and do this [Applause] [Music] and the reaper turn around yes madam [Applause] everybody okay everybody okay job to verse 17 i'm trying to take off quicker so she cleaned in the field until water so the second phase with the new law went from mid-time unto water everybody here this gleaming here is a painless gleaming [Music] yet he has work here at the beginning roof was not sure maybe she's gonna come here one time tomorrow they will not allow her she doesn't have job security and back here in the morning she can come they say no no no you found another field yesterday you were here we're going to get somebody else you go and when she enter she's going to start with a new person again and try to learn that person and see if they can give her favor and everything but as we move clean up all that uncertainty in one day boast never stop the work the first work was under the law of moses and he was managed by fear and complex anybody okay but the second law was under the instruction of boaz and it was a law that was managed by the love bowers have toward the roof everybody clear so when roof is working she's free she's working but it's no more work everybody when it's morning roof doesn't go to bed thinking what is she gonna eat tomorrow it is already guaranteed when she woke up in the morning she doesn't come up with question which direction am i gonna go she knows her field she knows her employee she knows where she gonna eat roof doesn't have to cook at home somebody was cooking in the field of boaz and when she get there she eat she said when she finished eating whatever was left do you know what she did she took it home with her do you want to read it she took ethernet to go box anybody care maybe the maiden were looking at her like one day he said praise be the name of the lord i'm amazed that you love me tomorrow she's second day when she's working without fear with that schwaber under security she can drink water when she wants she can eat when she want and she's still working but the yolk do you follow me the yoke of the lord has been taken off everybody okay so far everybody okay so far since we are dealing with roof in the holy place the ark of the covenant is in the holiest hey but here let's take the ark off my brother you ready at the computer oh my god that was too quick that was too quick devil you want to escape this i cannot escape this one that's a killer everybody okay that's a killer you ready my brother okay let's go we can erase everything and we keep the holy place and the other court you ready now remember what we just went through everybody here brother branham say justification everybody made way to water we are on the roof under sanctification everybody here so there is something in justification that sanctification is depending on everybody okay you cannot get to sanctification if you never were justified before everybody okay so far so if you pass this stage there is something here that is important for you over here what is going on when roof enter into the tabernacle you ready she met the president and the president meets the cross everybody here this cross does three things for you i'm going slowly so he can soak in number one the cross of jesus christ will end oh stop oh crush everybody here the law amen the bible says in romans 10 verse 1 christ is the water please stay awake i'm trying to help you for righteousness to everyone that water have you received the holy spirit since you so if you under justification ever here and you meet the cross the cross of jesus christ stop the law on you go to romans 7. lord help me let's go to romans chapter 7 roof under sanctification romans 7 if you dare you can say amen verse 5. you there for when we were in the flesh the what the motion of what which way by the water did work in our water to bring forth fruit unto what the black dog was in you everybody here so when they look him the law made the black dog stronger [Music] i'm going slowly drop to verse 8. but water sin taking occasion by water so when they're giving you commandment they're actually troubling the very devil of you taking occasion or opportunity by commandment wrote in me all manners of what concupiscence for without the lord's sin was what if the lord didn't come i was free when you begin to tell me do not steal do not lie do not do this automatically the black dog rolls up are we okay i'm trying to help you anybody here jump to verse nine for i was alive without the what was but when the commandment came sin did what the sin that was sleeping with if i tell you right now i say at the end of this church i don't want anybody to go back here do you know what's going to happen to you right now some of you can take it they'll be like why is he saying that some of you will not even want to wait they can try to go like going to the bathroom because it's taking too long they need to go what is behind there it is the law it is the law if i didn't say anything you can go walk without any problem and whatever you see there you're going to deal with it if you see a snake you run you deal with it everybody here but there is no snake there i'm just picking up everybody here everybody here so if i say don't go there automatically why not even if the whole month you never been there today because i say it you're gonna go when you finish right up there everybody why is he saying we don't go there is he any surprise again we already got the ego is there anything else that you got there do you know what because of the law everybody okay so far let's drop down now verse 11 verse verse 10 and the commandment which was ordained to what i found to be what for sin taking occasion by the commandment did what and by it did what so the lord brought me trouble everybody okay let's go to colossians chapter two help me i have to go slowly this is a troubling message colossians chapter 2 if you're there you can say amen colossians chapter 2 verse 13 paul is saying this anybody here and you being dead in your sin and your circumcision of your flesh god he has quickened together with him has forgiven you all water when you went to the breast and other god forgive you all the trespasses what does it mean to you why is he forgiving you all what is he doing at the brazen altar everybody here verse 14. you there blooding out the water the handwriting of ordinances that was against what so something was against you so as you coming at the president god is actually destroying your record god is having a shredder every record that was against you he's putting them in the shredder by the cross hey mark here ever here in other words you are a stranger woman but don't worry about being stranger i am the boss here nobody will touch you when you want to go get a drink go get a drink don't worry about what happened in your country moab i'm here i already know what you did for your mother-in-law i know how you left your country i know how you left your kindred i know the decision you took like abraham so i'm destroying everything roof that is against you everybody okay all the ordinances that was against us which was contrary to us and took it out the out of the way nailing it to the water his cross ever here verse 15 and having spoiled principalities and power all power everything that could dominate you god took it by the cross and he's destroying everything everybody so when you coming to the altar you're not just coming to make a decision and to ask forgiveness you need to know what it means everybody okay they alter don't only justify you it's also breaking the law and the power of the love from your life okay i'm going somewhere verse uh 15 having spoiled principalities and power he made a show of them openly try our thing over them in it everybody why am i why should i know all of this paul why you want me to know this paul this is the reason why paul wants you to know this paul say i want you to understand when you get at the cross when you give your life to jesus christ this is what christ did for you and the reason why i'm telling you this is because of this what verse 16 let no man therefore judge you in water or in water or in what in respect of a holy day or a new moon or of sabbath day i'm breaking the law completely out of you everybody here which are a shadow of things to come but the body in other words the reality is who so when you met christ at the present order everything that was in the law was fulfilled there in other words your requirement for the law is finishing jesus christ when you leave the president you don't owe anybody anything you are completely free nobody has a power to dominate you you have not caught it yet everybody here you have not caught it yet jump to verse 20 wherefore if you be dead with who from the rhythm of the world why as though living in the world are you subject to what you taught me you came to the cross and you gave your life to jesus christ why do you live again like somebody who's under the law i'm trying to help you in this message [Music] ruth you already left your country i already know i know what you did to your mother-in-law i know your decision you took why are you living in my field like somebody who is bound why are you living on the complex why are you living on the field in my field you are supposed to be free the work that you do should be a pleasure my god my god everybody okay anybody okay verse 20 wherefore you've been dead in christ from the rudiment of the world you already gave your life to jesus christ why as though you're living in the world why did they still treat you like you are in a save where somebody must chase you all the time but here the deacon must be after you all the time because you did something here you did something here you didn't understand what you did at the cross jesus you there are you subject to ordinances verse 21 do what and do water and do water this is what you have before and you made the mess out of it i came to rescue you out of it and you want to go back again from there that's why paul told the galatian who has bewitched you i'm trying to pull you off the law you had the law none of you was able to leave the law i'm pulling you off the lord you want to go back again there everybody okay jump to verse 22 which all are to perish with the using after the commandment and doctrine of water which things have indeed a show of wisdom in will worship and water and neglecting of the water not in any honor the satisfying of the water do you know what it means in other words by the law he gave people discipline he gave people humility he produces pharisees [Music] when you look at them they are previous their dresses are long they know how to talk in public they know how to do everything right they have a false humility they cannot have a good suit they need to have old clothing to show people that they are humble i'm dealing with your message stuff all the sisters should be slowed down like this are the brother in big suit very good [Music] everybody here he produced an image a show of righteousness but it's not satisfying the black dog all you have to do cross them you're going to see their temper cross them you want to see how bad they are a bunch of hypocrite [Applause] [Music] roof and sanctification ever here let's go to galatian two then i'll climb up a little bit higher go to the book of galatians chapter two oh good to hear you brother robert amen galatians chapter two if you dare you can say amen verse two and i went up no job two verse three let's save time you there but neither tatus who was with me being a greek was compelled to be what because the jew keep holding no no no de genta paul they gotta be circumcised paul luke he said you are circumcised all the time you are devouring the widow's house you are liars cheater with your circumcision this one is not circumcised look at his life so you want me to bring them again to your law [Music] what verse 4 and that because of false what false what first brethren unaware with that notice brought in who came in secretly to do what to spy out your water which we have in who that did not bring us into water the law is not at the cross it's finished but somebody's coming and taking this message and trying to bring you with the message back again to the law [Music] that's why the message is hard for you because it seems like it's a bunch of commandments you are obeying by fear [Music] you are putting long dresses not because you are convinced but you want to please mommy because brother stephen preached so long about high heels i won't bring them in church but i'm gonna bring them at work you are pleasing brother stephen you're not praising jesus christ you are still under the law roof under sanctification everybody here lord help me with time everybody okay so far so the cross does what he age right you should not leave anymore like the jewish people if you met jesus christ at the altar that's why paul say when you are in trouble you go into the throne of grace how do you know what body means you know what bosnia means his society when you're going to daddy do you do this you went there you put your hand on sound daddy you say daddy bodley roof you are entering with the law you are trembling look how much you sweat [Music] do you know why you're sweating because your mind battle is too much let me take the mind batter off listen this field don't be discouraged you will get the revelation later when she went home naomi said what is the name of that person who naomi job the food she runs up in hand she said blessed be the god who have not forgotten the dead everybody here roof look she said mommy mommy what are you saying he said blessed be the lord mommy wait wait what are you saying he said that man you don't know him ruth said no he was just man he's not just a nice man that man is my family and he's connected to your husband and there is another law because you never have a baby let me keep it go to sleep ever here go to sleep go to sleep he said listen young man don't go anywhere pay attention to everything he's saying if he say stay with the mother stay there you don't want to take a risk and anybody see you in any field my daughter this life is for you i'm doing everything so you can get well this is your last opportunity stay there i know what i'm talking about you listen to mama yes go to sleep everybody here anybody care everybody okay so far why you need to understand who you are number two lord help me [Music] the cross what he does to you is change priesthood [Music] you gave your life further out there you didn't even understand what you were doing today you're going to understand what you are doing [Music] i wish i had six hours with you is perfection whereby the word for under it the people received there what father needs was there that another preacher will arise after the order of what and not be called after the order of water if the law was good why do we need another priesthood let's handle the law everybody let's handle the law so when christ remember before jesus christ died he went before caiaphas do you remember what happened right do you remember what happened what right caiaphas say are you the king of israel he said you asked me i am anybody here hey do you know what he did took his clothes and ran and according to to the law if the high priest read the clothing he is what because there are priesthood melchizedek is in flesh they gotta switch priesthood [Applause] [Music] ever here when they switch priesthood jesus took that priesthood of aaron and went with the cross and kill it and put it down everybody okay so far they'll cross not only does it end the law does it change the pursuit but the cross changes also the lord itself oh the cross changes the covenant everybody okay everybody okay everybody okay paul says this he says father are you tired for the priesthood being what so there is a changing of the principle anybody okay karma there is made of necessity a change also of what so you cannot change the priesthood without changing the law you are working under the law of moses but i come in reference to your present altar in reference to the decision you took in reference to what you did to your mother-in-law in reference to living your country your kindred your people you remember what you did at the present altar in reference to that me boast i'm gonna break the law for you when you come to my field don't be afraid nobody will touch you you want to go eat go eat in the table you want to drink god drink you are tired go rest over there when you want to get food not only on the bottom go ahead and pick up the food from everywhere you want it because i boast i am taking your curse i am taking your penalty i am taking your your place i am taking your your complex i am mailing that to myself if anybody have a question tell them to come and ask me why is that woman weeping there boy i say why is she drinking over there boasting why is she sleeping on the couch boys go ask boys who are you i'm ruth they're more bankers you don't know me no i didn't know you what you doing sitting here go ask boaz i'm asking you a question i don't have any questions my answers are a boast my penalty empowers my restoration empowers my food and boys my working empowers my life and power all that i am [Applause] [Music] [Applause] church i am in two thirds not no two tenths of the sermon [Music] everybody here everybody here lord help me lord help me everybody here so far this love that was crushed at the cross that changed the prison which means necessity of changing the law you cannot change the priesthood and treat me under the old law you change the priesthood you change the law you change the boss you change everything everybody here new management my friend you got it right everybody here if the ministration of what written in water this law was written in stone so this law that we are changing involves some writings you there you there so if there must be changing of the law what is the new law galatians 6 verse 2 bear you want another's weapon and so ye fulfill the water the law of moses because the law must change their law came from moses but grace and truth came from so if we're changing the priesthood from aaron levitical to melchizedek if we're changing the law we need to change from the law of moses to the law of christ what is the law of christ the law of christ say to bear one another's what let's go slowly first corinthians chapter nine for though i be free from all men yet have i made myself servant untoward that i may get who paul say i'm free nobody can hook me i know what the cross did for me but sometime i make myself servant the reason why i'm doing that i just want to gain somebody what are you talking about paul and on twitter i became as a paul was a jew he was an israelite as an israel as a jew that amen gender jew to them that are undead because the jew from the tribe of judah under the law takes all israel as under the law that i may get them that are under to them that are without the law the gentile as we died there stop there what is paul saying paul was a master in theology he knew everything in the temple so when paul is walking paul is free from the law of moses but when he goes into the temple and he met a pharisee and paul looked from there he said that's a pharisee paul say okay since i'm a pharisee i'm dealing with a pharisee no problem anybody here paul come there he enter into the restaurant who's there you see pharisee okay pharisee in the restaurant where is the water to wash to wash your hands they bring water paul washes the water just like the jew does wash the water paul is not doing that because he's under the law [Music] here he's watching the hand so when the pharisees looking he said [Music] that's a pharisee paul say i got you he said hello there paul said hello he said come on eat with me paul said that's what i was looking at and paul sit down he said how are you doing i'm doing fun can i have a hamburger what else and the waitress said hamburger and the juice orange juice and everything how are you doing were you in the temple today saying no no no i didn't have a chance to go to the temple so how was everything at the temple were you there yes yes i saw you the way you doing you know it's hard to find brothers like this nowadays [Music] brother that are sticking to you know what i'm saying oh yeah yeah yeah your paul say i understand what you're talking about so what are you talking about you know moses said paul said yes moses said i know it's uh in detroit on me so it says say hey you know the law paul says i spend some time around it he says do you know this person yes but do you remember that lamb that they were talking about that and paul began to take him to hebrew and suddenly the pharisees get quiet and paul pull him he pulled him he said you remember moses spoke one time he said the lord your god will send us a prophet say yes i remember that and that prophet will come out of judah i never thought about it so what do you mean remember when moses spoke and before you know the pharisee is caught he said wow so jesus was christ paul said yes say i thought you weren't the law he said no my brother i was free from the lord have you heard about somebody called paul you paul say yes i am paul do you want to get baptized of course i want to get baptized [Applause] and paul put him in the water and paul come on he goes out again he watched taxi he said somebody's coming with a donkey where are you going i'm going down over there paul got in the dunking jump on i say you're a jew yes i'm a jew poor luke it's a gentile pause not his name he said yes i was a jew but i was not born here he didn't tell the pharisees are you following me i was not born here really you're not born yes i'm sorry of tarsus so you come from me now uh from an old country oh yes man this jew is here all the time washing hand washing here watching the hand washing hand so ah so at least i meet somebody who understand the people from outside paul said yes yes yes i understand you very well my brother paul said can we stop at mcdonough he said yes i'm hungry too he said give me some food they give food paul took the hamburger open and begin to eat so you don't wash your hands you say i'm not under the law of everybody's here i'm not done he said but what do you think he said have you ever noticed a man called jesus christ yes and then talk academy and bring him and bring him and bring it i'm doing all of this to gain people into jesus christ [Applause] everybody okay so far can i continue paul say now being not without the law of god even though i'm doing this it is not that i am not under the law oh paul i thought you were out of the law paul say but under the law to who my law that i'm operating this way it is no more the law of moses i am under a different law because the president already stopped the law for me he changed the priesthood for me and he also changed the law i am no longer under fear under trembling i am living in the love of jesus christ everybody okay so far now let's go back to jeremiah lord help me the bible says this in hebrew if the first covenant you remember had been faultless then should no place have been sought for the what meaning the first one had fault because the people were trembling if you touch the mountain god kill you if the animal touch they kill him all the time even if the high priest who's the top highest man if he goes to the temple the high priest is praying in the morning jehovah don't kill me don't kill me don't kill me when he goes there he's trembling because if something happened they put a cord on him if he dies there nobody entered it they have to pull him from there so you can enter you don't know what is coming out there until you come out that's the law of moses ever here for finding fault with them god said behold the days come say the lord when i will make a new water with the house of israel and with the house of judah that was in jeremiah paul is calling jeremiah in hebrew so when we quote brother branham there is no problem not according to the covenant that i'm made with there in the day when i took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of egypt you remember this because they continue not in my covenant and i regret them not say the lord for this is the covenant i will make with the house of israel after those days says the lord i will put my law in there and i will do what in there and i will be to them as uh and they shall be uh the law always requires a place of writings when he was the law of moses god needed stone and he wrote on stone moses destroyed he said moses go make stone again because he's come the second time god wrote in stone hey back here now there is a change in the law anybody here everybody okay when they change the law there is a new law if a new law comes god needs some tables everybody okay this time he doesn't need rock anymore he needs a heart to write something on your heart you're gonna get there soon everybody okay what happened god writes just like us how does god write in the book of daniel the bible say when belt says while he tasted the wine this is not the good wine this is the wine of babylon commanded to bring the golden and the silver vessel which of his father nebuchadnezzar has taken out of the temple which was in jerusalem and the king and his princes his wife and his concubine might drink therein so this one make him lose his mind our mind put us in the our wine put us in the right mind but the wine of the prostitute in babylon in revelation 17 if you drink that wine it turn your head against god so it depends on which one you're taking everybody here then they brought not the silver he asked for the golden and the silver and they brought there so the golden vessels means the vessel that was on the showbreath everybody okay did i lose you because the other vessels were in brass and everything but inside there everything was gold pure gold pure gold so they went and took the vessels that was from the drink offering and they want to pour another wine in the drink coffee everybody okay okay and the golden vessel that were taken out of the temple of the house of god which was at jerusalem and the king and his princess and his wife his wife and his concubine drunk in them and they drank water and did what so their wine also when you drink it it bring praises just like our wine we drink it he also bring praise the law is still the same but the praise is to the devil and the praises to god depending on the origin of wine everybody okay okay and they praise the gods of water so when you drink this one it brings places to your deity because it's a drink offering everybody clear of silver of brass of iron of wood and of stone in the same hour came the water of a man's hand and wrote over against the word these candlesticks are the candlestick of babylon and against them there was a light in the wall and the pillar of fire went not on the candlestick against the candlestick because in the temple against the candlestick was the table of children which also have the word of god the lord's still the same ever here upon the plaster of the wall of the king palace and the king saw the part of the hand that wrote what does it mean the finger of god you ready in luke 11 the bible says jesus say if by berezaboom cast out the devils by whom do your son cast them out so these jews also were casting devils and when jesus casted therefore they said you did it by the elizabeth jesus said if i did it by being able your children that are casting demon all the time here on tv on youtube the casting devil they're casting them by what [Music] so you can cast out the devil and not being on the right path not because somebody's casting out therefore they have power everybody okay he said therefore shall they be your judge but if i with the what the water so the casting of devils by jesus jesus called that he was casting them by the finger of god everybody okay matthew 12 if by beelzebub cast out the devil by whom do your children cast them out therefore they shall be your repetition but if i cut therefore by there so the fingers of god means the any question exodus and the magician did so with the enchantment they bring four flies to bring four flies but they could not moses did the copy moses did the copy after a while moses did something they tried it's not working yeah everybody here so they were last upon men and upon beast then the magician said unto pharaoh this is the in other words this is there everybody okay now where are we going with the finger of god exodus you okay now let's drop down i have to cut off i have to preach sanctification part one part two part three ever here and he gave out to moses when he had made an end of communing with him upon monsanto two table of water table of what written with there everybody okay that is the old covenant second corinthian year hour in our heart known and what of all for as much as he had manifestly declared to be the episode of who ministered by us written not with but with the not in the temple of but in there any question any question so the changing of the law require a changing of the covenant and the changing of the covenant ever here the changing of the covenant bring another covenant but that covenant have writings also everybody here but god doesn't need stone anymore god is requiring heart everybody here he want to put the riding not on stone but in the heart what are you trying to get with this heart here everybody here get me here so probably i'm going to stop here when you are born in this message you look probably like this everybody okay your dress looking good your face clean your hair longer you you look just like roof if they need to give somebody the holy ghost they will give it to you everybody okay when you are born outside of the message this is how you look if they ask who need to go to hell everybody will point to this one body part hanging out here cut down ready to murder somebody everybody okay but since we are dealing with the heart everybody here let's take our microscope and let's enter into the inside and look at the heart of someone born in a message and the heart of somebody born outside of the messenger everybody here the heart of this woman that is born outside of the message is black everybody will say amen snake ready to bite somebody everybody okay god is looking for heart god is looking for heart because he has a law he need to deliver a law somewhere but he cannot put the law in the stone because the law in the stone man could not leave it he took his law now he's looking at the lord not the law of moses but the law of christ which is love he's trying to pour that loss somewhere if i pour that on stone it didn't work now i'm looking for different stone but when god look in your heart he found the stone that stone that god saw is your heart everybody but if god put his law on your stony heart you will behave like jewish people so god have to change your heart and give you a new heart to put his law on a different kind of material [Music] because the stunning heart remind god the love of moses and the failure of man and the and the incapacity of men to do the will of god when god look he said i need a stone somebody said you look in their heart they have a bunch of stone there god said if i put their law again i put it in a stone look what they did i came they crucified me myself i cannot do that anymore i need to give them a different heart because i need to write my new covenant i need to write them on a heart but not a heart of a stone i have to take the stone away and give them a new everybody here this one as much as clean she look on the outside her heart looks also like that you might live just as pure and and and yet beer that's why brother branham said god doesn't have grandchildren you don't go to god and say grandpa god doesn't have grandchildren he only have sons and daughters you don't approach god as a grandpa ever here it is your faith that saves you many people they are just as pure and clean and yet a lot cleaner sometimes than people who profess christian lives but yet who denied the holy ghost would deny every operation of the power of god they are unbelievers no matter they are very welcome so both of you born in a message born outside of the message your heart look like that everybody cares so far then god by the cross everybody changes in your heart i'm going slowly everybody okay and i'm going to stop somewhere if you look at this heart even though it changed the snake is still there and whatever is on the outside here is still there and the atmosphere is still there don't get somebody like this married a bunch of marriage in the message is like this one but here because they're taking this plus this they say she is a believer later on trouble down the road everybody here why do we still have this stuff outside brother branham and i'm going to stop we believe in justification by faith romans 5 1 we believe that a person after he's justified by faith he has peace with the lord jesus christ but it's possible that this same person could have such as smoking doing things that he should not do filthy water yet looking clean everybody okay demon spirit is arising sure they are they have always been there they will be until they live right in the people and people don't know they give them unclean habit sickness disease because uh and all kind everything is caused by a spirit today he must smoke drink curse do things that his habit is hanging on to him it's just rooted in there it's water habits are water so when you are coming in the altar god kills the love for you god changed the covenant for you god changed the law for you and god does it because he's looking for a new heart ever here so god have to take your stony heart and change it into this kind of heart that is called the new heart but your process is not finished because you still have habit hanging around you still have the snake that's why god have to change and give you anew the mystery of the new birth everybody okay so far what else the new heart means and we stop here i shall take away the old stony heart and i give you uh that is the first order some of them stop in that first order she got baptized she looked clean now she's ready do you know a good sister to marry that one get her in the marriage a devil in the home [Music] only takes cross hair and the snake does this and you see the sister begin to do this everybody here brother branham said do not let them buried because it's going to be hell everybody here that is the first of them now you just getting started god's new heart that he put in you set right in the center of you that is your impulse that is your water so god have to change your heart because you and god were enemies they were enmity between you and god by going to the cross you made peace with god you are justified now your emotions your new heart gives you good emotion good impulse good vibration toward god you begin to have good feeling when they talk to you about god at the beginning they tell you about god you don't want to hear it oh god help me let me go with this god had to give you a new heart not a patchwork a patch up one a new heart that is your what intellect that you think with a new way of what i'm going slowly i'm going slowly okay when he gives you a new way of what yes that's right the bible looks more reasonable i used to didn't believe that i believe it now what happened to you you just got a new heart that's why they do something it makes sense at the beginning it was foolishness you don't have the holy ghost yet everybody okay it looks good i believe it now now there is your great revival they say yeah sure i don't want to go to hell i want to accept christ that's all right that's good that is just your first step then he said after that then i will give you a new what is that and you i want to do let's hold on to that we are with the new heart father we want to be like moses we want to be led by your holy son jesus christ to eternal life give it to our heart tonight lord tear out the order bless into us there the new heart of what the heart that you can and you can and we will not be water and water that is what god does to you first when you come out from the altar that's why you begin to go back to church now easily because you just got a new heart but you don't have the holy ghost yet don't venture yourself you're gonna find yourself in failure because that's what happened somebody with a new heart get under the emotion oh i felt so good tomorrow he goes back same thing on the floor what i thought i have the holy ghost somebody didn't teach you well everybody okay so far brother branham cross does an anoint minister to preach the gospel just to have it to return back to him void hey but here but he expects you to receive the word and when you receive the word be take the old cohide cowhide you have been in over there that all for more condition and swap it off for a sheepskin that to the what everything the bible said you say but it must come from there your new heart was stoned you were not flexible to the world when they preach you reject when they preach you resent but suddenly you notice in your life you begin to agree with certain things what happened is god already transformed your heart he gave you a heart that you become flexible to the word because god is trying to pour wine but he cannot pour a new one in all the vessels he gotta give you a new heart before he pour a new one so when the one begin to do this you can also flex with it oh god god have mercy the new one only ferments wine he only verified the element that is in there there is the only process for the bulb of the alcohol which make it bursting procession as they use bust the little bubble to make it more to give it a better to give it a better substantial holding to make it more and to make it so eaker but wine will never sour because the germ of life is in the wine fermenting pushing and doing water it's there to kill germa because your heart is with habit and a snake in it ever here so god cannot take his new wine his stimulation of the revelation and pour that in you you're gonna spill it you don't take a pearl and give it to the swan i have to change you from a swan into a lamb give you a new heart so when i pour wine when i say something you begin to at least agree with me and your vibration even though you don't understand me very well but your emotion to me is good everybody here where am i going to stop once you finish there you get in the water baptism and you come out just like that everybody here you move to the candlestick why do you move to the candlestick lord yeah gotta stop everybody here if i touch you and mentor this message he will now have no effect on you anybody here remember god say when i will bring you into the land i have to sprinkle clean water on you you remember because you have a snake and habit around you as long as nobody crosses you you're good if somebody gets you off the line you you bite him back here if i thought you meant to this message it will take no effect on you this is bad time because the predestinated seed are laying in there that will only be what water by the top of what that is giving for that that's why you coming to the candlestick to find the order of the day and my under looter a mayan the westlake and my under pentacles or this is brad time if it's bright time i need to find my messenger because my messenger have god's program for my day you're not ready yet i'm just giving you a new heart everybody okay so far and then the messenger doesn't hold you to him he's going to shine the light toward the table of the showbreath a friend friend don't look to me i'm your brother don't pay no attention to me because i'm just her i have to die like everybody else and he did don't you listen to me but listen to what i have what i said is there don't pay any attention to the watch there watch the temple of the show bread i am the candlestick look at the table i can be going out of the sin keep the table of the showbread right there [Music] the plan of redemption [Music] in the tabernacle let me land the plane everybody here watch the message keep your eyes roof not on there but under what is what he said that is the thing to do what stay with the message as john the baptist was the forerunner of my first coming your message the devil of the showbread everybody here so as soon as you get here some people get hooked here and they're in the message living like devils don't go to the messenger the messenger is a light shining on the table of the show bread move on to the shabble of the show bread what happened in the table of the show bread there that's where your sanctification start if i drop right now i'm going to be in the midnight zone everybody so far but remember now the cross kills the law the cross kills all the ordinances against you the cross changes the priesthood the cross changes the law you're not under a law of fear and trembling and complex but you are entering now with the law of boars and the law of borders his commandment you don't do it anymore under fear you don't do it on the complex you're doing it free you don't need anybody to be around you anybody here ever here because the law of moses will keep you on the internet when mommy comes you flip that's moses the law of christ whether mum is dead or mommy's not home it is not about mummy it is about boaz a man that never seen me a man that never knew me a man that never seen my picture a man that only heard my story when i took decision and with naomi about coming to a land and the first time he sees me he's treating me better than anybody else in my life everybody here all he's asking me stay in the field continue to do the work you are hungry are already provided you are thirsty are already provided nobody will touch you all he's asking me is this cannot disappoint the man ever here cannot disappoint the man ever here even though i can go and get whatever i want in the kitchen i am not going to abuse it because i don't want to disappoint him [Music] boaz told me whenever you hungry go eat and when i finish i take some home but i'm not gonna go into boa's place and get 10 big bags and go with it at home he's not gonna do anything he will still will leave me but because of what he did i want to be mindful to him i want to respect him i want to respect his thing i want to respect his property i want to respect his work even these workers are my servant i cannot treat them bad i have to treat them good because they are the worker of the one who showed me grace [Music] not i don't want to treat the worker bad because they're going to report to me in boaz no they can report me that's not the problem but reporting me to boast i don't want people to be talking about me all the time boaz she did this board she did this but what she did these boys she did this so i'm gonna behave not because of them because of because i'm no longer under the law of moses i am serving under the law of christ the law of christ is a law but it's operated differently let's stop here we will continue on sanctification let's stand sorry church but this is something you got out of the lord amen you have to leave the place where this message is just a law amen this message was not a law coming to church is not a law after you go through this you will see your coming to church will change if you are doing that because some come to church because of religion everybody care all it takes is something happened the out of church iran and the out of church they call for god's place higher they're out of church everything is out of church they have not understood boaz yet you have not understood boaz yet you don't understand who is protecting you a job you don't understand who's protecting you from coronavirus you don't understand who's giving you the strength to drive in the morning you don't understand who's protecting you on the highway when you go into work you don't understand who is keeping your husband when he's out you don't understand who is with you when you're driving that truck on the highway you don't understand who's with you when you're traveling the day you will understand who is doing to you all these favors then your serving of god will change you're not going to serve god because of me i'm going to show you this even in your offering i'm going to show you this i'm going to jump with this down until you see what you're doing because you miss boaz you enter into his field with the law you enter in the message with the law because everybody is wearing paint when you look the whole church wearing skirt in your mind so in that church they don't wear paint that's how you enter in the message wrong wrong door wrong door it is true in their church they don't wear paint but why don't they wear paint because when you're entering you're afraid you say if i go there everybody will be looking at me with a paint that's why i have to find some kind of skirt and usually when they put a skirt you will see it's a little bit right here you know that they're trying to cope a little bit with you because they don't want to embarrass anybody and then when they go home what do they do they put the shirt back again under the law i'm coming to your church oh those churches they don't wear a pen she found one you go see her at walmart tomorrow in the evening paint under the law of moses that's not the way i want to deal with you you don't understand if you wear paint at home come with paint come with paint and let us preach you paint everybody here we're going to preach that paint right in the face and when you're taking up the plant you're not taking up the pen because of me because if you take because of me you're still struggling i'm gonna teach you how brother branham say how do we sanctify because this snake need to be you need to to control it but there is a way you control snake let's pray heavenly father lord we thank you again father for your grace for your love for your mercy and for everything you are unfolding to us father i believe your children caught the point of what the cross have done in our life lord father usually we sing at the cross at the cross but when we look at the cross we usually see the death of somebody who took our place somebody who paid out who paid our price somebody who took away our sin somebody who died because of the world and that's the better and the further we can go further but lord this morning you have unfolded to us that the cross means more to us because if we miss what the cross did to us we're going to find ourselves like a galatian being brought back again into bondage we're going to find ourselves in this message living a life that we feel like we prisoner like we feel like we're still under the law we are not free like we feel like we need to do things to be pleasing people and father missing the very mark of what you're trying to do the center of all attraction the center of all hope the center of salvation the center of everything is jesus christ this is our husband this is our god this is the one that we want to please this is the one that we care for and father if we don't love you how can we love the people that we can see lord and father your love means something different than we thought lord father your love for father took you to the cross and to the cross you stopped the law and the reason why you stopped the law because you saw what the law did to israel israel chose the law and the law put them in prison and the law was unable to purge the worshiper no matter how many times father lord jesus christ lamb were dying in the temple tons of blood has been spilled on the altar lord but still none of the old testament sent was able to see your presence all of them went into paradise and they were locked there and the devil even had the right lord to go down and to pull the scent like the witch of andor did just because the cross was not there but today because of the cross because of what you did on calvary because of the brazen altar made flesh father no devil have any right to enter the sixth dimension because nothing will enter the sixth dimension if it's not love and father if it's love that is the law in the sixth dimension if you yourself you are loved and the law of christ is love father this is the law that you want us to operate your word into it not a law of moses because the law of moses will corner the people it will make the black dog more stronger it will give more attention to the black dog it will continue to point sin until all that the people are thinking about is sin sin sin and they even forgetting the one that became sin for them that became the the the present serpent and father that died in their place and to take away their sin lord father may you bring people to the bed of focus to come back again to the cross and to look at that brazen serpent and to understand lord father that when we're talking about sin there is somebody that was hanged at the cross and there is a sacrifice that is sitting on the throne and that sacrifice is speaking better things than the blood of evil and that sacrifice is not a sacrifice of somebody that is chasing us with a whooping trying to whoop us it's not a sacrifice of a policeman chasing us to shoot at us but it's a sacrifice of somebody even if he's whooping his whoop is a whoop of love even if he's spanking is a spank of love everything that he's doing it is always for our good father may you bring that revelation to your children so that the burden of the law can be lifted up completely and the message burden can be light and easy and they can carry this yoke easily and their father enjoying the message lord father and leaving the message with all joy and purity not to please people but to please your father lord we thank you and commit everything unto the hand bless them for the sacrifice they always do to go an extra mile with me on sunday lord father we commit them and ask everything in the name of jesus christ amen god bless you church we love you [Music] and renew a bright spirit within me let's sing it [Music] creating me a claim [Music] and renew a right spirit within me [Music] creating me a great one oh god and renew alright spirit within me [Music] [Music] oh [Music] me [Music] the joy of thy salvation [Music] y'all are dismissed we'll sing it again hallelujah [Music] create [Music] and renew a bright spirit
