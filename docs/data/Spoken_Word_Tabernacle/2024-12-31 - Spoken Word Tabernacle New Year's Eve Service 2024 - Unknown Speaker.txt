come to glorify Our God uh we come to lift him up on high uh because all that he do for his children is that right he made us hirs is that right [Music] Hallelujah glory glory be to God you know I just love whooping on the devil is that right huh I'm not backing up because we got his hand answer is that right we bragging we bragging in the Lord Jesus Christ because what he had did for us was on Calvary is that right all everything is moaning and groaning for the manifestation of the sons of God I'm looking at him Hallelujah let's go to Psalms on the book of Psalms we going go to two places in Psalms we go to chapter one yes sir once you have Psalms chapter 1 we're going to read the first three verses but we're going to look at uh the the uh third verse yes sir he says b blessed is the man that WTH not in the counsel of the ungodly nor standeth in the way of the Sinners nor sth in the seat of the scornful but his Delight is in the law of the Lord uh that's the word of God God uh that's what we're here for we delighted we love to hear him he says and then and and he meditate on it what day and night is that right he says and here's what we want to look at and he shall be like a what a tree planted by the rivers of water is that right which bringeth forth his fruit in his season is that right his Leaf also shall not wither and whatsoever he doeth shall what prosper and let's turn to Psalms 82 hallelujah hallelujah we're going to Ambush the devil tonight we're going to Ambush the devil tonight and then you he said once you have Psalms 82 you have it say amen amen say God what standeth in the congregation of the mighty he Juds among Gods you may be seated you we stand you know God standeth in the congregation of the mighty what we looking at here today we went over to Psalms 1 because that ties in with Psalms 82 because if you look at it you recognize that see brother brandham said that that planet that planet was a predestinated sea that was already God put it there is that right and the rivers are Waters by one spirit is that right when the son when the when the choir sang the songs yes everything is going to be restored before we leave here is that right we're saving Souls going to be eyes the blind going to be open limbs going to come back kidneys is already on the way being restored is that right we prophesizing we testifying these things is already right standing in the congregation of the mighty now the mighty when he said standing in the congregation of the mighty that Mighty in the Amplified version this is our little thought tonight our Mighty in the Amplified version version is the representatives God is standing in the congregation I'm looking at the representatives of God this ain't nothing like Saints God been hanging around Psalms 82 for a purpose is that right he's trying to bring you into it let's look at the just look at it now y'all going to have to bear with me cuz I get to go and I'mma go in my Yankee accent okay you're just going to have to keep up with it sorry brother Mickey is that right this is the night of the Jubilee is that right huh we get ready to pound on the devil here he said representative a representative is a person Chosen and appointed to act or speak for another he said or other make or he can make decisions on behalf of another is that right of a person know group is that right right you are God's representative uh you are God's bride is that right you know the mind you know the heart of the almighty God is that right God have saved the best for last in this hour here now he thought he had us in drugs uh he thought he had us in prostituting he thought he had us in drinking he thought he had us in gambling but if what happened Pastor the prodical son came what we came to our is that right you came unto yourself uh then you recognize deep down inside it was a cry it was a call is that right when you taking looking in this word in this message in his hour here now God has saved the best for last it was a breach wasn't it huh it was a breach of one time wasn't it God in the beginning was the what word the Word was God the word was with God and the Word was made flesh is that right so when God came down you got to understand Saint I see some visitors in here it's not a trinity is that right our God he's Lord is that right he's the Lord Jesus Christ is that right one Lord One Faith one baptism one book one Creed only Christ is that right so we coming we moving in the hour here now getting us ready to meet him where at in the air is that right I'm looking at the congregation of the mighty see to every one of us the congregation of the mighty of the singers is that right the gift that the sister have is to shake up the devil before the preacher come out here is we just walking right in it is that right you are part of the congregation of the mighty we got the musicians you are the congregation of the mighty is that right when we go out of here you got to understand what God has called you for and God's called you for on this mission here you cannot fail is that right you are part of the Overcomers you are the Overcomers you cannot lose Saint Jesus Christ already paid for it is that right in the beginning was the word the Word was God the word was with God and the word became flesh is that right I'm telling you Saints God is doing great things out there winning souls to the kingdom of God is that right we got great battles going on also we're fighting some tough religious demons I'm telling you but God has given us the answer for them is that right when God broke those Seven Seals is that right once he broke those Seven Seals All That Paul left out he's given us to be able to defeat the enemy why no such thing as Trinity is that right there's no such thing as the father and son Holy Ghost uh God said we repent be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins and you shall he shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost uh then he came to Iranians is that right he had to bring teaching along the Iranians to tear him down then he had to comeing Columbus time is that right then he came St Martin and then he came to Luther is that right he came to Luther he brought a message he brought a message in Luther's time to tear down Satan's kingdom is that right showing us the just shall live by what huh the just shall live by by faith we in a higher offer than Biden is that right I'mma drop something on you this how we win in these Souls uh by the ministry that was sitting up under here because it's not man it's Christ he said that's why she said whom have believed the report and to whom have the arm to whom have the power of the Lord been revealed to We Came to Luther Luther said the just shall live by what faith is that right then we got the Revelation uh the Mighty the kid that God's bride got the Revelation showed us that we what never did it is that right huh now with Biden the president of the United States uh he got right to Pardon his son that's come on now come on now come on now if you go up to his son uh do you understand what a pardon means huh do you understand what a pardon means you go up and try to charge his son with a gun charge you try to go into him that's right Pastor you won't happen you go try to go with racketeering it won't happen is that right you go try to charge him with tax evasion is that right what does a pardon mean a pardon mean you never it you never told us why he came back in Psalms 82 tolded us it was two bodies two persons there is that right you got a Celestial you got a terrestrial body you got a Earthly you got a Heavenly Body come on now you never done it whatever you charge with you never done it the blood only came and redeemed your flesh so you can walk on this Earth through your five senses see taste feel smell and hear is that right that's what the Redemption plan came for come on now the prophet of God preach you got to come on up some of you still looking at me like you're crazy don't let Satan come in your mind and tell you you did something because you didn't do it you're not going to convince me that old man the Old Glenn is dead he's dead you can't charge me with anything is that right when God came in there well I never did it is that right because the Bible says uh who can bring any charge against God's elect is that right so you never did it from the beginning come on now then when they dropped it even in the Garden of Eden when it fell in the Garden of Eden is that right the Satan thought uh he was going to get control of everything didn't he but the abstract title D went back to the original owner is that right he went back to the original owner so you have to understand now God have saved us the best for last why the son of man Ministry is to do what it's the win soul back is that right s them the Plan of Redemption that's right bring them back we winning souls in the institution every week why because you got to know who you are are and the message that you have is that right let me read a quote for somebody called the pastor and tell them brother kelly didn't read a quote he said be yourself right that's me is that right I fight some rough demons out there I don't have time to play with the devil no sir no [Applause] sir huh what do they do it's like Shamar he got tired in the Philistines didn't he huh he got tired of them didn't he let let see what the prophet of God say about uh um representation yes sir bear with me Hallelujah 11263 11263 paragraph 38 now according to the scriptures we are purposed to be we are written we supposed to be written Episcopal read of him the Bible says that we are written Episcopal he said now if tonight we with hunger and thirst to see the Lord Jesus and we as Christian Believers should reflect his life he said so much till it would be his entire what representation he said we should be that every Christian should be represented and reflect the life of Jesus Christ he said do you believe that he says and I believe that every Christian should be reflecting The Life of Christ that's right said he in John 14 St John 14:12 he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do what also and then we know that's that's true that we are his representation we are his representatives and if we claim that Christ lives in us and if Christ lives in us then we should do as Christ did am we should reflect his life am Hallelujah let me read you one more help me Lord I know the clock's ticking help me Lord we serve a supernatural God he can slow it down for me he said look what we got it huh huh huh huh see that's the way I believe is that right that's the way I believe I'm not finished until I go see when you go in those institutions I go in there with the message of the hour is that right and when I go on in the message of the hour they got to understand why they have to have a prophet they're not taught they had to have a prophet but you got to take them back over there to Exodus and show them that God promised to send them a prophet because they got Disturbed when God was going to speak to them is that right and when the mountains Shook and the Thunders and the rains and the fire they got scared they got upset is that right don't you speak to us let Moses speak to us he said now look Hallelujah help me Lord he said now look he said now I I pray Heavenly Father you know the weakness of my of the body is trying to and there's who wrong one help me Lord help me Lord he says now if Jesus Christ if Jesus

but Biden for a long time didn't want to forgive his son he held it for so long but toward the end of his mandate uhuh toward the end of his mandate before he exit his office amen he pardon his son that pardon is not the pardon of a judge it is the pardon of the president of United States it's a pardon that cannot be challenged it's a pardon that clear everything that you have done and put you back again like you never done anything in the United States and God before he exited the office of the son of man before he left this world and go back to the father toward the last time of his Mandate of three and a half years God also sign your pardon on Calvary God went to Calvary and God say it is finished and therefore you are justify like you never done it so there is no record against you you are as free as Biden son is free but we are not children of Biden we are children of the most high God so we are more free than Biden son he can be free in the United States but his soul might not be free but our soul has been redeemed and we are free indeed because who the son have set free is free indeed you are God's representative let's give the Lord a big cup of amen glory to God what

I'm say it's good to hear from different flavor oh praise God go ahead my friend amen God bless you Saints bless I believe we're all doing good amen it's always a pleasure to be in the house of the Lord if we could all stand to read the the scripture if you if you're there can you say Amen in Matthew chap 16 verse 13 to um to 19 the Bible says when Jesus came into the coast of the ceria Philippi he asked his disciples saying whom do man say that I the son of man am and they said some say that thou art John the Baptist son of some Elias and others Jeremiah and or one of the prophets he said unto them but whom say ye that I am and Simon Peter answered and said Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God and Jesus answered and said unto him blessed art thou Simon bar Jonah for Flesh and Blood have not revealed it unto thee but my Father which is in heaven and I say also unto thee that thou Peter and Upon This Rock I will build my church and the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against it and I will give unto thee the keys the the Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven and whatsoever Thou shalt bind on Earth shall be bound in heaven and whatsoever Thou shalt loose on Earth shall be loose in heaven may God bless the reading of his word y'all may be seated and my subject tonight is the shout the cry and speak in other words prophesying that's right and the reason why I picked this well the prophet ver is sometimes God cannot answer spontaneously how how many knows that remember Daniel had prayed and I believe it was 20 20 it was 20 21 days and something like that before the angel could get to him but he finally gets around and the reason why I read that scripture is because well like you saw the title it says speak the shout the cry and speak and we since we are the children of God and we're called to speak and I remember the scripture says God's word when it's sent out it will never return to him void and says we are also the children of God that mean when we speak our word should also not return to us void why because it should be God in us speaking and not us now in habakuk 2:3 says for the vision is yet for an appointed time but at the end is shall speak and not lie though it terries wait for it because it will surely come it will not t because sometime we may speak over our issues our problems and after that we want it to happen simultaneously but but the scripture says you can wait because if you it's like you're trying to rush God sometimes you can when you speak you need to wait a little bit be a little bit patient sometime it may happen at that instant sometime it may take a little bit of time in Exodus 13:1 17 it says and it came to pass pass when when Pharaoh had let let the people go and God let them not through the way of the land of the Philistines although that was near for God said let's pre Adventure the people repent when they see war and they return to Egypt see many time people they have like this pre like this premeditated thought when they're facing a trial and when they speak and they start thinking maybe it's not going to happen maybe this this and the third that's why God when he saw the Israelites when they were sojourning and trying to leave Egypt God already knew that they were going to be scared that's why he made them deviate away from it because if you go down later on when the people um of God Israel were facing the Red Sea and they saw the Red Sea they were there were scared they were scared of War because the Egyptian were following them and I'mma connect all of them in a bit if you just follow the thought in Job chapter 3 it says for the thing which I greatly feared is come upon me and that which I was afraid of is come unto me I was not in safety neither had I rest neither was I quiet yet trouble that yet trouble came because the thing about job is because he had premeditated fear that oh I might lose this my I might lose this some of us are walking through our day-to-day life maybe you're not speaking it out loud but you're speaking in your head and when you're speaking in your head it will come to pass like that so don't be shocked when you see something happen you're like well why is this happening maybe you need need to check on what you've been premeditating on on what you've been thinking over now the prophet of God said that now when he speaks of his vision whether it's wrath or whether it's healing it may linger but it's it's got to come to pass if he speaks it in the name of the Lord see it might be a blessing that he speaks for you he might tell you a certain thing and you can't see it at all you say how be it why he told he told me so said the Lord this is going to happen and that was going to happen and he a happen the man is wrong now you'll be judged and for disbelieving it but it's going to happen anyhow see it's got to happen though it lingers though it linger the Bible said yet will it speak in it it in its season till till it'll come to pass the prophet the prophets only looking off and seeing something he's talking about his looking at he ain't thinking about here and what you look or what you look like now he's looking what it's going to be and when he speaks that if it's the word of if it's the word of the lord it's already being spoke and there's nothing the world can stop it you see that's right only God himself you see that's why I had said earlier when a believer speak that mean his word should not also return to him void why because brother brandham said A True Believer is someone that believes in the word and the word only he stays in order with the word and if you stay in order with the word that mean when you're speaking what should come out of your word what should come out of your mouth should be the word because if you're feeding on the word the only thing that you can replicate the only thing that can come out of your mouth is the word and just to save time instead of um going turning the page well in Joshua 6:20 it speaks about we are all familiar with the story how the Israelite children went around Jericho seven time then after that they blew the trumpet then they shouted which is actually where I got my inspiration from because I was wondering what was the shout why did they shout because many time I read that scripture sometime I Ponder I was like what exactly did they speak and I started thinking I was like maybe I should I decide to kind of do my own like testing for example for example if I were to ask brother John over there to give me a shout how would you shout all right then see but if I were to turn to let's say my mom my or M and I told them um I told them excuse me I told them to give a shout or to what would you [Applause] do when I had heard that when I when I was thinking about that and I was thinking maybe this shout May maybe for me to understand why the Israelite children were shouting I need to go to Israel and ask them to shout then I was like that's probably thinking carnal then I was like how how would I know what they said and how did they know what to say because the Bible doesn't say exactly what they said and I started thinking about brother Brandon when he went squirrel hunting when he was walking and there was no game and the spirit of the Lord came down the spirit of the Lord was talking to him and was telling him what he needed and as he was talking he was telling him what he needed to say that's right that's exactly and when brother Brandon the moment he spoke and the word left his mouth the word whatever he said had to come to pass because the first time when he was hunting for three squirrel on the third one he got the three squirrel but then he was trying to push for a fourth one but it didn't happened because he didn't ask for a fourth one but then later on he came again and he was squirrel hunting again and the first he um the second time when he went squirrel hunting the voice of the Lord came to him and told him to speak where do you want the squirrel but since his first experience with the squirrel boosted his faith that he was like I will trust in you Lord so he said I want to scroll there there and there and so since he already got the first experience and he spoke and he knows when you speak when God say speak is going to come to pass when he spoke all he did was just wait for the squir to show up he saw the first one he shout it he saw the second one he shout it then he waited for the third one but the third one although he pointed there he did not come there he went in a different direction then he tried to shoot it until he ran out of Mag basically and when he ran out of Mag he realized that that's not where I spoke I did not speak for the squirrel to show up over there that's why even if I try to shoot it no matter how how many time I try it's not going to come to pass why because that's not the word that came out of my mouth that's why right then later on as he waited when that Revelation came to him and he caught it he waited then the squirrel that he was looking for it was very late at night the squirrel that he was looking for showed up then he shot it but it looked like it ran away so brother Brenham did not believe it so later on he waited again then he saw in fourth squirrel which he shot and he went dead then he remembered um throughout throughout uh what's it called throughout the night when he went to retrieve his squirrels because in his head he remembered that he shot four squirrels but when he went to reach for the fourth one he could not find the fourth one then he returned he was telling his friends about the testimony and the words were coming out of his mouth now a brother had caught what he said then he said he then when the brother was praying he spoke Lord God if it be true so you can like vindicate your Prophet tomorrow when we go over there may we see the squirrel then and brother Brandon was a bit shocked because he's like this brother who's seen me do Miracles and he's doubting me then later on the next morning another brother had called on to the prayer that the other brother made then he said brother Brandon let's go up there and get the scroll that you had dropped and on the way to to get to verify the squirrel as brother Brandon was walking at this time he was walking alone the Holy Spirit came to him because he was thinking what if the squirrel isn't there then the Lord God came down and started talking to him he was like well if it's not there then speak it and brother Brenham says he was already shocked and he couldn't really trust in himself because when he did he couldn't find the squirrel last night he couldn't trust in himself so he was like Lord since you spoke it and you told me to speak I will just believe what you say then he arrived at the place where um the squirel was he looked around he looked around he couldn't find it then he then a thought came in he was like what if the squirrel is not there then a thought another thought came he say but what if it's there then he kept looking until he finally found the squirrel and the thing that I want you to catch from this is when the word of God comes when you're a Believer and you speak you need to speak things into existence you need to speak perfect and when you speak see when you speak it should bring when you speak the right thing is should bring a prophecy because if you look through 19 1959 on uh speak to this mountain brother brandom brother Brandon was talking and um he was actually with two brothers and those Brothers they got delivered they got saved and they were they were fishing and they couldn't catch any fish because they didn't have any bait so they were talking to brother brandham and they they were saying brother brandham maybe we could stop by the Little House nearby here and go get some bread to from a old lady here that used to give us bread to like catch bait and brother brandom when they were talking they say maybe we should go over there and we should also tell them we should also tell her about us our Salvation that we got saved and brother brandham said um like the spirit of the law had dropped down because he had said the right thing the spirit of the Lord dropped down and brother brandham started prophesying and even brother brandham didn't know what exactly he was prophesying so when you speak the right thing you're basically prophesying this Holy Spirit himself will come down to vindicate what you're prophesying and what I want you to just get from this is as we're stepping into this new year I want you to step into this New Year speaking the right thing and prophesying over your own CH over your own challenges like in Jericho when they had spoke maybe he had tooken a little bit of time and after before the wall had fell but even if it takes a little bit of time just wait a little bit as long as you're right with the Lord God whatever you speak shall come to pass may the Lord God bless you prise God praise God this is a good exercise amen sometime you have plenty of time to eat sometime you don't have so you got to learn how to eat quickly and to shoot the gun quickly and make it happen amen amen so when you speak you got to learn to be patient brother Bram say when God spoke let there be light God had to believe his own [Applause] word I see my brother there and my sister God richly bless you and welcome in spoken word Tabernacle you're not visitors you family member amen praise God brother Bram say when God spoke God had to believe his own word and if you are God's and all of you are children of the most high when you speak you must believe your own word are we together are we together brother Bram say when God spoke the world it took years before it happened but remember the word won't come back void in other word when you spoke something even though it have not happened yet it doesn't mean it won't happen what God is talking to you is be patient wait for the prophecy it might take a while but just remember believe on what you spoke it will happen if you spoke about your child who back sing don't worry about it give it some time it will happen that child one of this day like the prodal son will walk coming back home are we together oh glory to God I don't know brother Robert how we going to go with this I'm going to read a quote can I read a quote can I read a quote okay brother Bram says this in the message tartarian because when I'm listening to them the boss is lining things up he says I know your faith and brother Bram is explaining he said now he does not say here as he did to the church in pergamus you hold your faith that one they were holding the faith he's not talking about his faith now but he's commanding them for their faithfulness and as he does he also mentioned their patience now faithfulness and patience goes together faithfulness and patience goes together if you got true faith it will produce patience are we together brother Bram say for in fact patience is the outcome of faithfulness hallah [Music] Hallelujah for he says in James 1:3 the trying of your faith work patience there is absolutely no other way in which to gain patience he has to come by the trial of your faith the first squarer came straight ahead the second one came quickly the third one lingers and brother Bram was tired he say I already got two I'm going God say you not going nowhere you spoke three you got to stay right there sometime what you speak happen sometime what you speak linger it doesn't mean it won't happen we need to learn patience and wait on what we spoke because your word won't come back to you void yeah God and Christ is in you and Christ in you is the hope of glory oh let's give the Lord a big clap of Glory Glory Glory brother Charles Hamilton thir come on up my brother Oh Glory to God remember you don't work have work tomorrow for the majority of you and we don't have service

yes sir God bless you am God bless you s you know it's uh it's a good night tonight amen Heen we're U bathing in the blessings of the Lord amen amen I would like to um get right to it if you could stand and get to our scriptures amen IID like to go to uh Ecclesiastes 3 31 Ecclesiastes 31 amen yes sir [Music] I got there myself I got it Ecclesiastes 31 get there say amen amen it reads to everything there is a season and a time to every purpose under under Heaven amen now I like to drop down to verse 10 it says I have seen the travail which God hath given the sons of men to exercise in it amen he hath made everything beautiful in his time amen also he have set the world in their heart amen so that so that no man can find out the work that God maketh from the beginning to the end amen uh you may be seated amen so what I would like to get out of this right here is that you see that there's a time to everything amen and we see that you know we're on the cusp of a new year amen in in a uh in to our calendar to time for a new season amen so um I would like to speak on this subject because the Lord hit my heart to where you know you you get what you look for amen so how you step into this year man you're you're getting what you're going to look for in this year amen so if you're if you're looking to grow amen you're going to grow amen if you're looking to you know if if you're iffy about the year if you're not fully you know ready for it you know you're not going to get anything out of it amen amen and you know that's you know it is it's That's the Law of like even of the Bible me reap what you sow amen that's how the Lord Works amen um I would like to go to uh Luke 4 verse 19 Luke 4:19 you get there say Amen Luke 49 it reads you know I'm I'm yeah I I'll say I'll read right here I'll start right here it says to preach the acceptable year of the Lord amen and he closed the book amen and he gave it again to the minister and sat down and the eyes of all of them all of them that were in the synagogue were fastened on him and he began to say unto them this day is the scripture fulfilled in your ears amen uh this really hit my heart really strong as well because it says you know uh what I was hung up on was he closed the book that's what I was like why did he close the book you know I was curious about that because he uh he says CU he say a prach acceptable year of the Lord then he says this day is the scripture fulfilled in your ears amen so what the Lord hit my heart was that you know when you go out in the world they have a closed book amen see you uh you're not going to walk around with the Bible in your hands you know all day so you can't go up to someone and say read this you know you are the Bible to them amen so when when you go to someone you are that scripture fulfilled amen so that's what the Lord hit my heart with because you know um you you can't you just can't go in the world and and go about and you know you you you have to live brother B says you know uh live me a sermon Don't Preach me a sermon amen so that's that's what you have to expect amen and um I was looking at uh the the uh uh the dictionary for season amen men because we know that uh for season they're fading in and fading out we know all things have a season amen and um we see that uh via Webster it says uh a season is a Time characteriz characterized by particular circumstance or feature amen so we know that each age is characterized by particular circumstance or feature amen and we know we're in the lateran church age amen and we know you know where our circumstance is that you know we uh um um Satan is at his strongest you know At His Highest and so is God that's our circumstance and our featur is that we're to overcome amen and um so I was looking at it and um I want to read a a quote it says uh this is 1955 the True Vine and the false Vine it reads it reads um and as long as there's an earth here God will have a church representing him I will restore sayith the Lord all the glory of the former days I will restore with a kaker worm left I will restore healing I will restore the Holy Spirit I will restore the joy amen I will restore everything that the first church had church had amen I'll restore it again in the last days we are living in that day when it is amen that is our fature amen and um it reads he says uh brother uh step off this thing and get over here as quick as you can amen because we want to take part of these blessings am me you don't want to be a bystander on the fence amen you know I want to take part of it too I I want to be part of the blessings amen and it reads um uh you know it's the season to apply the word amen you see if you don't apply the word you know if you choose to sleep on it you know you fall off the window and die amen amen because you know that's what happened with with the young man amen and you know it's a season for the sons and and Daughters of God to mount up with wings like an eagle and swore amen because we know that um uh the bride have made herself ready amen by the preaching of the word by the gospel amen and um and just like you know it was one of my topics I wanted to speak on was you know uh your faith works works your patience amen because we know um you know uh when you when you preach when you say something amen that uh it's prophecy coming out of your mouth amen and you know the prophet taught us that you know if you look for something to happen you know it may not happen at that moment but the way to look at it is doesn't happen today it'll happen tomorrow amen if it doesn't happen tomorrow it'll happen the next day this week next week you know uh this year next year amen you know that that's putting your faith in action amen and um I would like to to read I have it here for a sake of time I'm just going to uh uh read it it's a Philippians 3 uh 13-16 U this is Paul speaking he says Brethren I count not I count not myself to have apprehended but this one thing I do forgetting those things which are behind and reaching forth unto those things which are before amen I press toward the mark of the prize of the High Calling of God in Christ Jesus let us therefore as many as be perfect amen be thus minded and if anything ye be otherwise minded God God shall reveal even this unto you amen nevertheless uh where to we have already attained let us walk by the same rule let us mind the same thing amen so continue to walk amen that I would say for this here continue to walk amen continue to uh uh to you know our our steps are ordered by the Lord amen our feet have been shot with the gospel the preparation of the Gospel amen so with that in mind continue to walk amen you know don't don't walk don't uh don't go to the left or to the right right stay stay in the Narrow Path amen and um see uh so what does this mean for the bride amen see uh the promises for our lives must come to pass before the Rapture amen so you know uh every year every year when a new year starts you know at least for me you know oh Rapture happen this year you know uh that's just how I think you know and and um and uh you know so when when I think that you know say oh so that means if the Rapture is happening this year then that means lots of good things things must happen also because God promised me things in my life you know so you know so that's how you know I I believe every believer should should think amen um you know because you know even because you know how uh the people with the worries they'll say uh should we sell our houses sell everything just you know not do anything because the Rapture is happening amen well no brother B brother bham taught us that you continue you continue uh to live your life as you usually would and if anything you know uh that should put a Zeal in you to when the circumstance comes going to say no the Rapture is happening meaning this circumstance a victory must come out of this circumstance amen so um I want to say that say that as well and um in closing I would like to read uh one more one more quote uh just before I close uh it is in um uh uh Christianity versus idolatry it says um we are partakers of his Holiness amen we In His Image we are living images of a living God then dead to self raised with him he says now listen to this his word made flesh again in us look what is it not the mythical imaginary God sitting out there but the Living God what is the Living God the word in you making itself real oh I know you think I'm a holy ruler maybe I am but oh brother do you see it see uh triumph over every denomination triumph over all paganism Triumph a living God made manifest in the living Temple see that that's what makes you triumphant uh in the word of God

midnight that they may not shout here come the bridegroom go to him amen and those that were ready amen so those that have acknowledged the message of their time those that kept their lamp amen amen they kept their lamp lit let me read something here quickly blessed be the name of the Lord blessed be the name of the Lord in the message Divine love 1956 on August the 26 amen blessed be the name of the Lord let me just verify here brother Bram says this if you cannot forget your child no matter what the child has done how much more do you think God will forget about you he says God for your

preaching 1949 in uh December the 25th blessed be the name of the Lord paragraph 82 brother Bram says this Brothers sir sisters that deity is in you amen amen blessed be the name of the Lord just a little while and the world will not see me by you you shall see me because I will be with you even in you to the end of the age Christ where in the manger no no sir Christ in you hallelujah hallelujah

as it is because when meet him we shall look like him it's going to be the spirit in the human being blessed be the name of the Lord I'm going to read again in the message the revelation of Jesus Christ 1960 in April the 12 blessed be the name of the Lord paragraph 371 listen to this and you can be saved without being Sanctified oh my God God can save me without being Sanctified and you can be Sanctified without being saved this is what is saying here you can Bei and don't have the Holy Ghost that's true a spirit that is Sanctified without being filled you sanctify your heart you purify your heart without filling it with something this is what he say when a Spirit come out of a man he goes to the dry places and he will come back and if he found the house empty all clean up and the spirit will come back in and the L condition will be worse seven times in the beginning amen amen so you might be saved without being Sanctified where did I get this we talking about the subject the god of the midnight amen amen in Matthew chapter 14 32 31 to 32 you can read it yourself I'm going to skip it because of time if you notice there Jesus told the disciple to go to the other side of the SE because he had to dismiss the Gathering and the disciple got into the boat and go going on the on the sea they got in the midst of the sea but when Jesus finished dismissing the church he climbed on the mountain to pray at the same time they founds in the midst of the sea and there was a great Tempest that came out there was I mean winds that were blowing and the disciple got afraid amen amen so what happened Jesus came down amen 25 and Jesus came he was alone and the boat was in the midst of the sea and then she was uh going back and forth because the winds were contrary but Jesus came to them walking on the sea walking on the sea and it was at that for that Jesus stretched forth his hand to save Peter because at the beginning they thought it was a ghost or spirit and Peter say if it's there beat me to come and he said come on and when he start walking he begin to get deeper one if you notice he was in the midst of the night we talking about the God of the midst of the night because in John 19 ver8 in that passage of the Bible Jesus was crucified and there were two also that were crucified with and one from each side and Jesus was in the midst of them just just to to save a son of Abraham that was also condemned at the cross now remember where we read brother brother Bram didn't give us the scripture but brother Bram spoke that you can be saved that Fe the cross was saved without even being baptized you see what I'm trying to say he never was baptized just because Jesus was in the midst of the trial the the the the the very thing of Jesus being in the midst of your trial when you are in the house of the Lord you will be healed here without any effort without even your prayer just by hearing the word of God you will find yourself being automatically healed there are so many things I'm going to skip if you remember Daniel in the Book of Daniel 3: 25 26 they took three Hebrews and they cast them into the fire but when the king approaches the he found the presence of the son of man in the midst of the fire walking on the midst of the fire with SH and and amen so when you facing a midnight of your life a midnight crisis on a humiliation or maybe you have maybe you are in the midnight of sickness maybe a situation that is a midnight for that is a midnight for you and in that midnight your God who is a mighty one who Ste there to pull you out of the situation he came down in the fiery furnace and then the king asked a question when they came out from the fire they didn't even smell fire Danel the same thing they put him in the Lion's Den the lion never even kill him if it's finish I got to stop right here let me say this and close by this amen you will also remember Ruth chapter 81 it was in the midnight that boas got scared and then he turned around and there was a woman laying at his feet called [Music] roof that's when Bo gave the blessing upon roof to roof that's when the Deliverance of rof started in the midnight that's the time that he told Ru I will do everything that you desire out of me everything you are asking of me when Jesus said in Matthew that's where two or three are gathering in my name I am in the midst of them am amen when you are two or three gaing in his name Jesus will be there the disciple were shut in and Jesus after the resurrection everything locked in Jesus never knock the door he just presented in the m to show that every time you Gathering like we here church tonight Jesus is already [Applause] here that's the reason why that's day when you when you say the name of Jesus Christ The Name of

remember You Are Not Alone brother Bram say the scripture say do I walk in the midst of the Valley of the shadow of death brother brandham said to have a shadow you must have a light so meaning when

Tony Allen come on for 15 minutes praise God God bless y'all this is kind of a different position than singing a song my God is good he he knows what's best um if you got your Bibles let's go to the Book of Matthew chapter chapter 22 verse4 yes sir got it say amen amen it's a very short scripture yes my brother but it says a lot it say for many are called but few are chosen sir let us bow our heads and pray dear heavenly father oh God we we dedicate this service back to you again oh God and as that you move me out of the way oh God and for this short period of time oh God that you will speak to your bride amen oh God and that that they'll be filled oh god with knowledge oh Lord God and Revelation oh God and that you will speak to whoever need to be spoken to Lord God we commit this back into your hands in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen so the scripture say for many are called but few are chosen that's right you know it it really explains itself and I went to breaking it down I was I was thinking about I was like well if there are many that are called and and there's only a few that are chosen so and I went looking at a call and and the prophet talked about you know a calling is a cry out and and and he talked about being called and being called out so you can be called but you have to be chosen to be called out do that make sense so you can be called but you have to be chosen to be called out so my my my subject for tonight will be the chosen ones speak about the chosen ones in the message to Queen of Sheba sir it says Christ never died just to let people have sympathy God doesn't run his office that loose you wouldn't ruin your office that loose Christ never come from Heaven saying well I'll die and perhaps maybe people feel sorry for me and come no sir Christ died to call the election the body elected before the foundation of the world and them alone Jesus said no man can come to me my father draws him and all that comes to me I give him every ever lasting life and raise him up at the last day there you are there you are see Christ died to save those who God by for knowledge know will be saved so in other words we're the bride of Christ and Christ went to the Cross just for us so if it safe for me to say that the Holy Ghost belongs to us the Holy Ghost is ours and and we see we see people come in and and enjoy the effects of the Holy Ghost you know with it on their flesh but there's nobody that can get to enjoy this Holy Ghost like the bride of Christ which is the chosen because we have him on the inside and it's a different Revelation with him on the inside sir if I could kind of explain it it's it's like like going to a job interview if you notice um I noticed like if you go to a job interview you they may have one position that they want to feel but they were interview about 10 people and I and other 10 people got called to the interview 10 people got called to the interview but it's only that one that got chose he get a different call he get a call that the other 10 didn't get he gets the job so he gets called out of that group and he gets the job and and once he get on the job he goes to the supervisor the manager which is the boss man immediately when he get there the first thing they do is start pouring out that's it the knowledge of the business they bring they bring you in you know we pick you for the job you're the man for the job so now we're going to put you in our wings and we going to train you we're going to give you all the knowledge for this job and he began to pour all this knowledge in that guy and once he reach a point of perfection then he's allowed to run the business and then he can he he he don't feel bad to walk away sir I can leave I can walk away and leave brother Charles here now because brother Charles got the mind of the boss man I don't have to be there with brother Charles he can run the business himself and that's what God does he takes you behind the veil he gives you the mind of Christ so that you can run the business that's why that's why Jesus was so quick to say I am about my father's business but you got to have the mind of Christ to be about the father's business only Gods can be about the father's [Applause] business and when we say called out um we like to say oh we chosen we been called out to um the first thing we to think of oh man God chose me to go to heaven I'm going to heaven God chose me I'm going to heaven but really what he called you out was a sin condition it was your condition that he called you out of so your position can never change the the garden didn't change Adam position it put him in a different condition so when when you think about think about yourself you are a chosen generation each one of you are chosen to be here tonight not not just for this message but God took you out of that condition you was in we all was lost but God took you out of that condition he changed that condition he changed the way that he look at [Applause] [Music] you and and when it come down to choosing and being chos there there's nothing anybody can do about it God does the choosing so that mean your mama your daddy can't choose you the preacher can't choose you the proph can't choose you God got to do [Applause] it if you don't mind turning to the book of Samuel yes my brother 1 Samuel chapter 16 yes my brother and see can I tie this in real quick and and and and show you that it ain't up to you it's not up it's not up to you no sir sir 1 Samuel 16 yes my brother it's a very familiar Story chapter 16 verse1 it says and the Lord said unto Samuel yes sir how long would thou mourn for Saul seeing I have rejected him from reigning over Israel fill thy horn with oil and go and I will send thee to Jesse the bethlehemite for I have provided me a king among his sons so this is God giving instructions and and I looked at the word provide and one one of the definitions that stood out to me was to procure beforehand to get collect or make ready for a future use to prepare so in other words whoever this King was that he was going down to CH to choose uhhuh he had already been working [Applause] on so this this was not no situation where he was going to go down there and find him a man and then start molding no he was already working on this man and Samuel said how how can I go if if Saul hear it he will kill me and the Lord said take in heer with thee and say I am come to sacrifice the Lord so basically they they going to they going to call a meat they're going to call call a church meet and you know we're going to throw Saul off make a sacrifice unto me L this is God talking make a sacrifice unto me and and he he he won never think none of and he said what I want you to do this God still talking verse three want you to call Jesse to the sacrifice and I will show thee what Thou shalt do and thou shall anoint unto me him whom I name unto thee that's right and Samuel did that which the Lord spake and came to bethle Bethlehem and the Elders of the Town tremble that is coming the prophet coming so they don't know if it's bad or good so they ask him comest thou peacefully and he said peacefully I am come to sacrifice to the Lord sanctify yourselves and come with me to the sacrifice and he Sanctified Jesse and his sons and he called them to the sacrifice and it came to pass when they were come that he looked on elab now this is Samuel this is Samuel doing doing the looking right now it came to pass when they were come that he looked on elab and said surely the Lord's ano before him now if you know the order of Jesse's son you would know elel was the oldest so so in other words he he probably was the biggest you know you know by Statue so in other words the prophet Samuel was beginning to judge he was begin to look at his in a natural in a natural way that's your Psalm 82 ver7 that's right the prophet the natural side of him was getting ready to pick a man for God but but what but watch God correct them he going to quickly correct them verse 7 he said but the Lord said unto Samuel look not on his countenance or on the height of his stature because I have refused him for the Lord see not as man see for a man look lookth on the outward appearance but the Lord lookth on the heart lookth on the heart so now the calling getting ready to change in verse 8 not Jesse getting ready to start calling remember what I said the prophet can't call you and no man can call you so here come Jesse go he going to call he can't ready do his calling this is Chap this is verse eight then Jesse called abadal and like I said if you know the order of the son now badad is the second oldest so I'm I'm thinking in his mind he thinking well if the oldest one ain't ain't the one then it got to be the next one in line Lord so he called aadel and made him to pass before Samuel and he said neither have the Lord chosen this then Jess made shmar to pass by which was the third oldest so so basically he's going down the line can't be [Applause] David but this has got to be what they thinking it can't be David so so so so so this is what he said he said he said he made Shaman to passed by and he said neither have the Lord chosen this and again just made Seven of his sons to pass before Samuel so so that didn't satisfy he made them go past him again like surely they got to be in this seven and Samuel said unto Jesse the Lord have not chosen these and Samuel said unto Jesse are here all thy children here we go and he said there remain yet the youngest and behold he keepeth the Sheep and Samuel said unto Jesse send and fetch him now the word fetch mean to go get and bring it back to go get and bring back keep that in mind kind of remind me of myself we was I was lost in the world but God sent the Holy Ghost to come get [Applause] me he came and got me cuz I was not looking for him so he came and got me and brought me back so he sent and brought him in now he was a Rudy and wither of a beautiful continence and and goodly to look to and the Lord said arise anoint him for this is he that's right now I was back there happy when I heard brother poar talked about the sanctification now I'm going ask you a question was David there when the other seven sons got sanctified he was not there he he came in and and immediately got anointed but God knew what kind of heart he had he had a heart after [Applause] God so it's kind of it's kind of like when when before you get your conversion you you have like signs of of of of being a Christian you know you you're doing world things but every now and then it's like a glitch in the system you you have a thought that that a sinner don't think you know you don't catch it at the time and you know you just thought it was a random thought but no that that's that seed on the inside and it's and it's a deep calling to the Deep see you don't understand what what's pulling on you at that point and and you you continue to still be out there and be a sinner but every now and then that that seed that that seed will pull on you it it'll pull on you and and I'm one that I was in the world I used to to the clubs but when I got to the club sometimes I would feel myself with my back up against the wall say what am I doing here and and and everybody else having a good time but I'm like what am I doing here and and I realized that was that seed working the whole time see God always work on the chosen ones he don't just start from day one he's always working on you you just don't know he working on you yet then Samuel took the Horn of oil anointed him in the midst of his Brethren and the spirit of the Lord Came Upon David from that day forth so Samuel rose up and went to Remar let's go to chapter 17 uh verse verse 32 let's jump down chapter 17 verse 32 in the same chapter 1st Samuel 17:32 but I want what I want you to draw before I read that is that God was the one that chose David amen the the prophet tried to the make the CH the choice the father tried to make the choice but God stepped in and made a choice of what he wanted so verse 32 it says and David said to Saul let no man's heart fail because of him now this this is this is the period of time when Goliath that's right he's out there running his mouth like I like to say talking about talking about the God the Living God he said let no man's heart fail because of him thy servant will go and fight with this Philistine and Saul said to David thou are not able to go against this Philistine to fight with him for thou are but a youth you're just a youth how you going to fight fight this man and he's a man he was he's a man of war from his youth so here you are a youth and you trying to fight this grown man that's been a man a man of war since your age verse 34 and David said in the sa now this this scripture here I love cuz David getting ready to testify yes sir he said thy servant kept his father's sheep and there came a lion and a bear and took a lamb out of the flock and I went out after him and smoked him and delivered it out of his mouth and when he arose against me I caught him by his beard and smoked him and slew him so let me tell you what your servant did thy servant slew both The Lion and the bear and this some circumcised filstein shall be as one of them see if he had defiled the armies of the Living God so what I'm saying he was already working on David Through The Lion and the bear David had no question in his mind that God wasn't with him God God had put him through tests through trials he knew God was with him so Goliath was just another test to David so you need to take that impli to your own life take every test you done been through take every trial that you done been through and when the next one come you just look back in the past and say if he delivered me from this if he healed me before if he made a way before surely he's able to do it again he's more than [Applause] able see every every test prepares you for the next test and and and and if you ever noticed the devil will always remind you of your past but won't tell you what God did for you in the [Applause] past he he'll tell you about your whole past but he will not remind you what God did for you because he know if you can ever look back and see what God did for you there's nothing that can handle you in front of you he knows [Applause] that so we need to let every every scriptures is inspired said so so every every story in the Bible is inspired so this this story not is just not for David it's not about Jesse you know when when it when it come down to the tests and the trial that he been through I put Tony in there I put Tony in there Lord you heal you heal me before and and now I'm facing another battle surely you able to do it again so you you got to plug yourself in the scripture don't don't don't just look at it as a story to read plug yourself in the scripture and let and let the scripture work for you but based on the chosen ones my words to you before this year end is we must be about the father's business you been chosen but what what have you been chosen for to be a Christian you've been chosen to be a Christian and a Christian is about the father's business so we don't have time to do nothing but be about the father's business God bless [Applause] [Music] yise God praise God so you discover a new preacher tonight sister Katrina he deserve a big [Applause] steak I'm sorry the last get the best so you're going to get the last best 10 minutes brother set coming in 10 minutes remember to look at me praise God Amen Lord help this Inspire 10 minutes amen amen can we be up standing amen want to take Hallelujah the word from Philippians 4:4 Philippians 4:4 I know we already know that scripture it says rejoice in the Lord am always and again I say rejoice amen may the Lord have his blessings to this word amen can we be seated tonight amen amen as the Pastor said it's 10 minutes and we're going to be done in 10 minutes amen amen so Bible says rejoice in the lord always and I I just love the fact that there is an end a ND the prophet said it's a conjunction the end continues always so it means there is no e n d to the A and [Applause] D the rejoicing is a loop when one is done it starts another one so there is no way you can rejoice and stop it said rejoice in the lord always it didn't say rejoice when I have money or rejoice when I have a car but it said rejoice in the lord always and again I say rejoice so no matter the situation that comes in our lives he said Rejoice amen and amen amen we want to take this from Psalm 33 amen amen trying to put it together in 10 minutes amen Psalm 33 verse one it says rejoice in the Lord oh ye righteous for praise is calmly for the upright now when you look at the word calmly it it talks about beauty now amen so there is something about rejoicing that makes the upright beautiful right and when something is beautiful it brings an attraction so it is the attraction that a man sees in a woman that makes him love her there something that pulls there a pooling amen so I want to take [Applause] amen I want to take verse 10 just to skip amen the same Psalm 33:10 it said the Lord verse 9 sorry for he spake and it was done am he commanded and he stood fast so the Lord already spake it is a past tense and he said it was done for this cause we have to Rejoice so it is not starting now it was already ended that is why he said and again I say rejoice rejoice in the lord always and Bible says rejoicing is an attraction it's a beauty for the upright now I want to take a quote from the prophet Lord help me amen and amen I don't know if if we got it now um show us the father now I said show us the father said and then when Jesus Christ spoke these words they never die SS claims in 20 years we was speaking in 63 in 20 years from now they can pick up the literal voice they will be able to pick up the literal voice of Jesus and the prophet said is still in the earth whatever the Lord had already promised his bright is still here and it says CU see it's a sending post and I love that comma there it said you are so Christ is ascending post and he also says you are also a sending post amen so my message tonight is a sending post and a receiving post so said then there has to be a receiving post now said and if you can be the receptacle what is a receptacle a receptacle is something that receive something onto itself it said and if you can be the receptacle see receiving post to receive the word of God then it's real to you and it's it will live just like it was then whatever Christ was then the prophet said he spoke the word and he still living today and when we are receiving post and it manifest to us it will be the same word that he spoke then amen amen so what does rejoicing do rejoicing is an attraction to the word of God a receiving post must have an attraction so whatever promise the Lord said when I take it up and I said this is what the Lord said and I'm rejoicing it is receiving what the Lord has already posted and God said you are also a sending post so I will send the post and I also receive the post that is why I said ye are Gods so God had to create the word by by by by by speaking and when he spoke the word he had to believe it so believing is also a way of receiving whatever he spoke and God made us in his own image amen amen and amen oh Lord Jesus let me let me just keep all this quotes and do this last one amen wonderful this is from um Revelations chapter 4 part two amen he said bra Bram is saying something said I've noticed this in my own little humble Ministry that there's many times that I will say something and not know why I said it and it don't look right but here somebody will say something but I will watch and that thing will just come as perfect around to that as it can come God will make it happen BR said for some reason sometimes he say certain things and he doesn't know why he said it but then he'll be watching around and then he realize that it came to pass that's right he said when I just want to say something I'll say well now wait a minute that guy so this to happen over here now that just has to be that way well really I don't know why I said it and the first thing you know is just that way God does it am amen so let let me take the he said now when these disciples had said there was a time where Peter was I believe I have some few minutes so there's a time where Christ was talking to Peter sir and then Peter was like I'm just trying to summarize it he said what about this man John that's right and then Jesus I'm just paraphrasing he said um don't really think about John whatever is going to happen uh it doesn't matter whether he T till like come and all that just think about yourself just follow me yes sir and then now the prophet is saying Jesus said so he said now when these disciples have said oh Jesus said this this man Wouldn't Die Jesus never said that that's what the Bible said that the people the disciples Mis interpreted what Jesus was saying about John so said Jesus said what is it to you if he lives till I come so the prophet is saying but to see the disciples making a saying of it there was an easing amen that were going on then Jesus reached down and took J on and brought him up and let him rehearse the whole thing oh my God see the rehearsal of the coming of the Lord so the disciples were saying that John will not die that was the easing that was going on but the Bible said Jesus never said that and the prophet said because the people were saying that God had to take John and rehearse exactly so whatever we are saying about our lives even if it was a mistake God will take it and bring it to [Applause] past my short message for tonight we are both a sending post and a receiving post God bless you hallah praise God sister what have you been feeding [Applause] him oh my glory to God so because the disciples said it God was forced Amen to make it happen hey I'm going to make some mistake sister Glen can you be healed glory to God God is bringing his Brad to a

day of our lives and every moment of Our Lives let's just worship him let's just live for Jesus let's keep obeying the word of the Lord and all that we have been hearing at word upon word word upon word it's all for a purpose just as we've heard the ministration coming on it's just for a purpose so don't mix the purpose amen I don't think we have to say anything because a lot have been said and yeah but uh I just want us to Worship the Lord Jesus let's read a portion of the scriptures and just uh say few things to add to what we be said the Lord is good let's read from Matthew yes Matthew Chapter 2 about this season that we are in amen why are we here because we have seen this and we are here to worship Him Matthew 2 sir now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of erod the king behold there came wise men from the East to Jerusalem saying where is he that is born King of the Jews for we have seen a star in the east yes sir and I come to worship Him Father we thank you we are here to worship you because we have seen your Star Lord we are grateful for how far Grace has taken us to this very hour Lord Jesus we ask that you forgive our past and bless our future to be more like you Lord Jesus to reflect you that your Works will be made manifest in us thank you so much in Jesus name we pray amen amen God bless you saints of God let's be seated yeah so we are very grateful to the almighty God and we thank God and uh have far Grace has brought us and uh the 2024 is already gone almost and uh we are looking forward you know it's Grace that has brought us this far and uh the same Grace will take us through so let's keep on holding on to the word of the Lord all that we have been hearing is building us is preparing us for what is ahead of us so as we enter the year remember this thing that we have heard yes sir from Brother Kelly coming to minister to us and the brother follows and abet and so remember the word of the Lord and I'm grateful that the Bible says that the word of the Lord will not be in vain as the scripture says the word that has gone out of my mouth God said will never return unto me void it will serve his purpose so we are not here by chance amen so just a little to speak and encourage us we are here to Worship the Lord am God is an object of worship and that's what we are made so as said yes read it h Rejoice again I say rejoice and so we saw this wise men the Bible called him wise men because every wise man will follow the word of God Amen and remember this amen ah this men were astrologers or whatever they call them were taught in the scripture they were studying sir until they saw this unique sty this constellation and remember not everybody saw it God reveal it to them amen so Jesus said thank God for your eyes for they see and your ears for they hear because it is not given to everybody so if it is given to us we should be [Music] rejoicing because it is not what we learn it is Grace that give these things to us and so these brothers or this man and they saw that star and they look at there were many others that were studying the stars but it was revealed to this Breen this man and just for you to remember they have to travel for almost 2 years that's right and they were not driving on the super highways they were traveling in the night in the night because the stars appears in the night amen so the night they take follow that star so God send Seven Stars the stars appears in the night when teachers and theologians have gone astray then the star comes to give us the light to show us the path so remember to follow the star Hallelujah so remember they have to follow the star for almost 2 years and they had a problem on the way when they leave on their own understanding when they see oh we are now in the big city we don't need a star again and so let us let us go and find out from these people here so when you you you overlook the star you get confused you get confused when they miss that start they okay now we want to think on our ways I mean Reon yet I think it should be this I I think we are in Jerusalem so it should be here and there and then they almost lost their [Music] lives they got confused so keep your eyes on the star I mean don't try to reason don't try to reason and think oh maybe the star no no no the star LED them for 2 years watch the star and because that star was sh today for a purpose it was revealed today and when God reveals something to us it is for a purpose that's amen and so they have to travel all these years on here and there and okay they came to Jerusalem oh Hallelujah when they came they said they were shouting why is he that is born King of the Jews why is he that is born and the Mage St the whole city where is he that is born and listen this men were Nobles so it does not matter your education and your qualification and your dressing no when God is revealed to you it becomes an anchor you cannot keep quiet you'll be rejoicing night and day hallelujah praise the Lord when God is revealed to you it was revealed to them and they have to follow and they came to the ex where is see that is Bing of the we have seen a star they were not ashamed to declare we have seen a star we have come to worship Him the purpose of the coming was to worship the king of the Jews the king that has been born and they LED it to the house of pharaoh or erod and they say the King is here he said not not this one this one we just saw the star Hallelujah and that shows that is born it's somewhere and then they have to call a councel meeting all the Sadducees and the Pharisees and all those and they me and they look at it it was there already God has already spoken about that they look so yeah it is true Bethlehem uh-huh the least among the tribes it is there but they have been reading they have been studying uhh but there is a time for everything there is a time and a season for God's word to be [Applause] fulfilled you cannot make it to God will have to do it amen there is a time for everything under the Earth or under the Sun what god listen God is in control right there is nothing out of ker don't worry no you might not understand but there is somebody that understands we don't know tomorrow we can't tell tomorrow but he knows tomorrow and our lives are in his hands so there is nothing to worry about keep trusting keep believing keep resting on it because Faithful Is God who called us who began that good work he will complete it Hallelujah he will complete it don't have to worry hallelujah oh why is he that is born King of the Jews we've seen a star we have come to worship him that's all that we are here for listen brother I don't think Jesus Christ Minds about what day you worshiping in he want to be worshiped every day he said listen Christ was not born in December he was not born in December he said listen but whatever it be it is for us he said if Christ has not been born there will be no Resurrection if there has not been a Christmas he said there would not have been peace amen yeah that's right he said this is not a pagan liation to us this is a sa hour if there had not been there had not been no Christmas there will be no Resurrection if there be no Christmas there be no love there be no peace there be no herea for the believer that's right amen amen if there be no Christmas amen so he say it's for us he said Christmas is not a celebration it's a worship it's for us can celebrate the birthday of Nixon or what you call him George Washington he said but for Christ is worship that's why they say we have seen his star we have come to worship we are here to worship him we don't say celebrate we worship Christ Our Savior and our King our Lord and our God we are here to worship Him Hallelujah brother bam said God want us to worship him every [Applause] [Music] day amen we've seen the star have you also seen the star and I want you when something is revealed to you yes sir oh my it becomes an anchor that's it okay when they came and they sign and say yes it's written in the scripture but then I question so aod told the wise men go and search dently why didn't the rest of them said if it is so let us all go and say that's right because this is something that has been written this is something that you have been looking forward to that one day God will be made flesh and they testify right there but why didn't they go with the wi it's not given to them there are many people that oh yeah this is true yeah this is true they said it is true but it was not given to them thank God for your eyes thank God for your years for it is given unto you to know the Mysteries of the Kingdom to others it is not Hallelujah and I want you to take note how this men traveled would not just for almost two years yes sir when they came to the house of erod and they thank God the Bible said said they should go and look for that place and said when they came out of the denominations of their reising of their ideas they saw the star again they left the star but the star was waiting for them so when you left the Lord you will be waiting for you so listen throughout the year check where did you leave the star and get back your commitment your dedication your your loyality where did you leave the sty that's right God may God help us saints of God we have seen a star we are here to worship Him Hallelujah and they saw the star of praise and they Rejoice they rejoice and so again I say rejoice because we have seen the star Hallelujah and and think about Revelation think about it they travel through the jungles listen these were not just ordinary men because they were riding camel right listen you think it's easier even to hold a c today goe come today if they even rented it for two years how much are they going to pay so this men were men Royals but when it came to Revelation it is not about you no sir it is not about who we are no sir it who he [Applause] is and they left everything to worship him oh we come from the East and the West we come from the land Safar because we have sin oh from the Methodist and the agant and catholism and whatever because we are Sinister hallah Hallelujah and look at the what it is revelation there when they got to where the star LED them the star LED them to the word made to the reveal word the king of the Jews and when they got there think about it Hallelujah they didn't worship Mary they didn't worship Joseph how how old is this boy two years get of if he's not sleeping come on boy bring it praise the Lord come on praise the Lord two years boy and this man big man look at the size of this man here and a 2year boy come on stand up come man [Music] come on took about two years Bo took about two years Bo and this great man this man from the East they travel for two years and they come before him and they [Applause] bow Hallelujah brother said the importance of Revelation but the spirit of God to the True Believer can never be overemphasized two years boy if there were Neighbors in the house and it was a compound house and they saw this man coming coming to the house dress nice and they said we have seen a star why is it that is born King of the Jews and God by Revelation might have revealed to them that is the king of the Jews the very star that led them made them to know because John said I don't know him but he that sent me to baptize reveal to me that the one that I see the spirit of God is say upon and abiding he is the one so the very God that reveal it to them brought them to the boy Jehovah as a boy Jehovah as a boy Jehovah running around joov running around Hallelujah we have seen a star we have come to worship Him and brother bam said and they presented their gifts they didn't give it to Mary they didn't give it to Joseph to [Applause] the go Frank incense amen he said what is it Dy God is service to die their gifts shows what they believe he was they give the gift shows what they believe shows their thought about him and remember your gift your life your present shows what to think about Christ your behavior your attitude shows what to think about [Music] amen we have come to worship Him may the Lord help us where is he that is born King of the Jews and they give their present what they thought it was and the Bible say we should present our bodies that's right as a living son sacrifice unto him brother Bram said we should give him the best am he wants the best am giveing your best Amen brother said as the coming year I want to do my best amen I want to serve him better am I want to be more consecrated I want to lay aside everything like the brother just said to be about the father's business to give give everything because he said only in this life that you will be a mortal when this life is over mortality is over so let's give in our best and worship him and brother Bram said let me try to read this one to worship Him worship Him with all that is in us hallelujah he said here we ought to give the most Hest he to the things which we have heard what of what type of people ought we to be amen when we see the great Jehovah come down and do the things that he does and see then compared scripture by scripture that they are the truth and we sit around sometimes like a watch on a lock and just so unconcerned we all to be busy every minute trying to get people to Christ we ought to be Lively Stones we should never be slothful like we are we would go up to church okay and we will see the Lord Jesus do something or bless us in such a way and then we'll go back out and say oh very nice meeting now the preaching of the word we enjoy it but that's not the main thing that's not we should not Worship the Lord Jesus or Worship the Lord just after we get through preaching the word as we usually do just worship him sir that's wonderful but we should worship him every hour of of Our Lives when we are at work we should worship him every time the opportunity present itself Worship the Lord by testifying of [Applause] him amen if you see someone some of you ladies see a woman in the wrong Worship the Lord by taking air and saying sister there is a better life than this amen you men at your work when you hear a man using the name of the Lord in vain get a chance to one side and sleep over and take him by the hand and say you there is a better life than this you shouldn't use those words and tell him in a mi Gentle Way all those things is a worship and when we see someone sick and the doctor says there is no more can be done we ought to Worship the Lord by telling them there is a God of Heaven that answers prayer and then when we see those things take place and we do see take place and then we should never let these things sleep we just let it go through our fingers that's what the matter with the great Pentecostal Church they've let the every cream of the crop slip through their fingers which should not take n to the thing that we have had Worship the Lord he said even in your car Worship the Lord you PR we are so close to the coming of the lord we should consecrate ourselves for the coming year as you see this year fading God's Grace has brought us this far we want to worship him every moment of Our Lives by dressing in our dressing in our conduct in our ACS sisters brothers in even your air dos and your air Styles and your conduct worship the Lord remember remember this pastor read a sermon a quote from the beginning God me the black God me the white God me the blue God me the fat God me the short worship the Lord It's Not By by mistake that God made us the way we are it's not by mistake he he sees us and is happy Worship the Lord by being grateful that he made you the way you are appreciate what he has given to you Worship the Lord don't go against the word brother Bram said the word is getting darker and darker he said when you T from the light it will become darker right but Shalom to the bride Shalom when you come to the word peace be unto you God bless you saints of God let's [Applause] the like I say a veteran is always uh he knows how to go straight ahead and and uh get to the purpose amen glory glory glory musician you can come straight up and if we can prepare for the Lord's Supper we still have some minute before midnight and let's go straight to the Lord's Supper amen you heard what the Lord says we usually like I say when we get in this message we need to be reprogrammed because when we say worship the first thing that come in our mind is lift up hand which is true which is a part of worship amen there is more to worship than that worshiping the Lord with your life that is a service of worship unto the Lord amen praise be to the name of the Lord amen amen amen glory to God don't be on hurry let's give the Lord what he wants I'm going to read the quote so it's going to help you brother brandham says this if you want the cot I can send it to you later it's in the message communion brother Bram says this if I'm not mistaken brother Bram say this in paragraph 73 do you know that communion has Divine Healing in it if you need this quote I will show you I will send it to you amen there are three ordinances brother Bram call that three orders that the Lord left amen it's foot washing water baptism and then communion brother Bram say those three are Perfection I have the quote where he says that amen so this is very important you have a whole year yes without the Lord's Supper technically speaking everybody should be here right because brother Bram called this a showdown and brother Bram says that it's a duty of a Christian to take it but we usually take it as an act don't even realize what it is this was done over there in type when Israel was leaving Egypt and that's why brother Bram is saying I'm going to read it again he says do you know that communion have Divine Healing in it when the Israelite in the type took the communion and marched 40 years and when they came out of the wilderness there was not a feeble one among them two and a half million people there is power of healing in the communion everybody is welcome now there is power of healing in what we doing here amen so let's pray Heavenly Father Lord we are approaching you humbly tonight father we thank you for your grace we thank you for your love we thank you for your mercy we thank you for your blessings Lord father if we go through funeral homes I don't know what list we can pull up of people who passed away this year some Sinners some believers that went to be with the Lord Lord but Lord everyone who is here tonight will spare from being taken back to be with you father we went through sickness we went through accident we went through many trouble that the devil thought he can snatch us out of your hands Lord but despite that we came out safe you protected us some are here that didn't even get sick some are here that didn't even go to the emergency room for the whole year and father sometime we might take these things for granted not even realizing the grace that have been following and protecting us Lord and overshadowing our life and Lord father here tonight you gave us this opportunity to gather together with the sense of like Precious Faith Lord to approach you in your table Lord father if there is anything that we have done in our life that could be a hindrance to our blessings Lord father we ask you forgiveness Lord we pray Lord that you sanctify this bread may you sanctify this wine Lord father May what happen in the Third Exodus be reproduced again in the first in in this third exodus yes it happened in the first one father in the second one you yourself took communion with your disciple before they go into temptation father I pray Lord that a supernatural healing take place tonight Lord for everyone that will partake on this Lord May something special happen in their life Lord father bless the reading of the scripture in the name of Jesus Christ amen let's go to First Corinthian chapter 11 praise God 1 Corinthian chapter 11 glory to God if you dare you can say Amen verse 23 the Bible says this that for I have receive of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you so Paul received this from the Lord amen that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed he took bread and when he has given thanks he breaks it he break it and say take it this is my body which is broken for you this do in in remembrance of me so it's a commandment the Bible says in verse 25 and after the same man also he took the cup when he had sap saying this cup is the New Testament in my blood this do ye as of as ye drink it in remembrance of me it's a commandment for as often as he eat this bread and drink this cup ye do show the Lord's death until he come amen wherefore whatsoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body of the and the blood of the Lord but let en let a man examine himself and let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup for he that eateth and drinketh worly eateth and drinketh Damnation to himself not Discerning the Lord's body which is the briad for this cause many are weak and sickly among you and many sleep so those who took that unly got consequences they are sick and some died but if it cause trouble to those that took it unw worly what about those that took it worly they got to be something done to them also your worthiness is not on your brain your worthiness will be always centering in Calvary in other words you might have sinned this morning you might have get upset this morning but put everything under the blood you can never approach here without the blood no matter how much you think that you I woke up in the morning I have not done anything now I feel like I'm in tle I will never approach the Lord serer like that I will always plead the blood and pray God that maybe something per Adventure I did something that was wrong but if I'm approaching this not because of me but because of Calvary because of the blood it's your blood that made us worthy to be able to even take the book from his hand and eat the book The Bible says that for this cause are many uh many are weak and sickly among you and many sleep for if you would judge if we would judge ourself we should not be judged but when we are judged we are chest of the Lord that that we should not be condemned with the world wherefore my brethren when ye come together to eat ter one for the other and if any man hunger let him eat her home that she come not together unto condemnation and the rest will I said in order when I come so I'm going to give you few minute pray if if there is something you need to put it under the blood put it under the [Music] blood give you a few minute you may uncover the bread and the one and brother Robert you can go ahead and break the bread father we are coming together unw worthy and the worthiness that we always Proclaim is that which you paid the price for us on Calvary Lord as we hear the noise of the breaking of this bread it remind us how your body was broken because of us Lord father being trapped in this body that is waiting for the Redemption Lord somewhere we sleep up maybe in our word may be in our mind in our thinking in our meditation in our action and reaction father in our conversations everywhere even that which we don't remember Lord we pray that you forgive us father I'm standing here as a Shepherd for the church pleading the blood upon each one of us Lord and father praying that Lord the benefit of communion be granted to each one of us so that Lord father the healing that is in it may touch our body some have high cholesterol some have high blood pressure some may be the sugar is battling left and right some may be a problem in the kidney may be a problem in a place where some are not even aware some has been praying for something for so long an issue that they have been battling in the body but they don't know Lord father may this be an opportunity tonight you the god that heal in many different ways that you can take Lord father this as you took the stone of David and may Lord father you directed in our body so that he can bring healing to our body you can renew our strength amen

amen amen happy New Year 2025 praise God Amen praise God glory to [Music] God amen amen amen amen amen glory glory glory once you finish then we go to the feet washing and then we let you go home amen amen get some smile God has been good to [Music] us praise God praise God praise God God BL amen amen amen if you finish you can grab your bible in the Book of John chapter John 13 usually as pastor we will receive a bazillion messages so I'm already saying to everybody Happy New Year in case I don't respond to your message Happy New Year amen let's go to John Chapter 13 I believe we can get a little bit of time to do the feet washing then we read couple quotes and we let you go home but you made it amen amen praise God brother brandham says in this message he says in paragraph uh 91 preach on 1962 November the 4th in the evening brother brandham say some people try to say it's not necessary certainly I don't mean to say that people's feet need washing that is not it maybe theirs did not either but it was an act of humility amen amen it's an act of doing just as essential as water baptism this is the prophet if you want all this quote I'll put it in the chat amen because he has said here that I have given you an example that you should do to each other as I have done to you as we found out that a widow could not be brought into in among the people unless she had lodged strangers and had washed the feet of the saint showing ourselves humble so let's take a little bit of time and go through John Chapter 13 and do it this is the only time of the year you can do it amen now before the Feast of Passover verse one when Jesus knew that the his hour was coming that he should depart out of the world out of this world unto the father having loved his own which were in the world he loved them unto the end and supper being ended the devil have now put into the heart of Judas is kariot Simon's son to betray him Jesus knowing that the father has given all things into his hand and that he was come from God and went to God do you know how the devil entered Judah it was by giving communion because Judah was not chosen but if you are chosen and you get communion into to you what do you think can happen oh glory to God he says verse four he he riseth from supper and laid aside His Garment and took a towel and GED himself after that he poured water into a basin and began to wash the disciples feet and to wipe them with the tower wherewith he was GED then cometh him to Simon Peter and Peter say unto him Lord do thou wash my feet Jesus answered and say unto him what I do that knowest not now but thou shall know here after Peter say unto him thou shall never wash my feet Jesus answered him if I wash thee not thou has no part with me do you see how important it is Simon Peter say unto him Lord not my feet only but also my hands and my head Jesus said to him he that is washed needed not Sav to wash his feet but is clean every weight and ye are clean but not all for he knew who should betray him therefore said he ye are not all clean so after he had washed their feet and had taken His Garment and he was set down again he said unto them know ye what I have done to you ye call me master and Lord and he say well for so I am and if I then your Lord and Master have washed your feet ye also ought to wash one another's feet it's a m that's why brother Bram say it's a humility amen because technically if he was the master he was the disciple to wash his feet but he's the one doing it and the Bible say verily verily I say unto you the servant is no greater than his Lord neither he that is sent greater than he that sent him if ye know these things happy are ye not if you know watch the scripture if you know these things it's good to know but happy are ye if you do them so there is a blessing that goes with doing this so the sister will remain here in the sanctuary and the brother will go right there until we get a signal from the sister that all is done let's do this and we come back and we read couple quotes and we pray amen praise God for for for [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] no [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]

singing our God is tremendous you got to go home Happy amen ah we got a list we have not finished so we can if there is no uh special on Sunday brother John you can see if you want to um move them toward Sunday amen so I'm going to read couple quotes praise God these two quotes are in 1960 on December the 31st brother Bram says he this it's in Revelation he says this is New Year's night Eve and of course every everybody's got a vow wrot out and a pledge you're going to make for new years's then about day after tomorrow they all be [Laughter] broke so you know you turn a new page every year and then turn back the next morning did it again but there is just one thing that I would like to say and that is that like Apostle Paul say forgetting those things that are in the past all my mistakes and all the things that I have done are pressed toward the mark of the high calling in Christ that is the only regret that I have is my errors for the past and the past part of my life and I only humbly ask him for Grace to press on toward the mark of the high calling I'm sure that is the testimony of all of us we all feel that way that have been said in paragraph 15 now I want to say this before I start I wish to each one of you all the most successful and blessful am and healthy New Year that I can wish to [Music] you brother Bram say God be with you may you grow BR physically
