man come on up pastor hallelujah well that's a wonderful message wednesday wasn't it ain't going to say nothing about it i got plenty to say but i ain't going to say nothing amen blessed be the name of the lord let's give the lord a hand this morning hallelujah how many listen to the sermon on wednesday young people you got it you got it we clear now amen yeah you need the holy ghost if you want to follow this message amen without the holy ghost even the simple bible will be a trouble to you amen we pulled scripture on wednesday showed you like mark and look and john they all look the sims it seems like it's a contradiction but there is no contradiction in the bible amen if you want to study you take mark you take matthew you take luke you take john you put him together then you're gonna see the whole picture amen but if you go with your brain you're going to be trouble with the bible you need the holy ghost because man of old spoke by the holy ghost amen and the same thing apply for the message of the hour amen brother brown i'm saying here this way brother branham stay here this way put them together and ask the holy ghost to lead you amen hallelujah no matter what you do there will be a pharaoh that will not recognize joseph even though he got his paycheck from joseph amen but still he's not going to recognize joseph amen despite everything you're going to give it to him he's not going to recognize joseph amen blessed be the name of the lord you know brother branham said that jesus christ spoke certain things purposely to make somebody else to live [Music] so i'm not going to be able to explain you the entire message because there are stuff that have been spoken in a message to help somebody leave the message amen it was meant for that purpose ii thessalonians chapter 2 and with all deceivableness of our righteousness in them that perish because they receive not the love of the truth that they might be saved for this cause god shall send them strong delusion not just a delusion a strong one strong delusion that they should believe a lie you go back in the old testament you found out that to deceive ahab amen god used a lying spirit and that spirit was not going to the nightclub spirit was not going to the gamble place that spirit went on inside the prophet inside the preachers amen and the preacher begin to prophesy lies history repeat itself amen but there was one preacher by the name of makaiah amen the difference between makaya and the other preacher machias sermon was line up with elijah the prophet amen zedekiah got angry that's the anointing of a lying spirit it is an anointing with anger i am angry i am frustrated i am mad it is an anointing on zedekiah in an expression of a lying anointing amen do you know why did they hate him by zedekiah because mackay was unveiling the spirit that was on the false prophet he received the revelation of the lying spirit that was upon the other prophet church flee amen look for a mecca preacher that's going to preach you the bible in line with malachi 4 amen look for a preacher that's going to preach you a message line up with elijah the prophet that's the preacher you need to follow that's the message church you need to be under amen we don't have another message we only have the message of the hour a sure word of prophecy and that word is a lamp in this dark laodicea i'm not going to preach blessed be the name of the lord we got brother sean martin today i believe most of you know him you saw him in our convention coming back and forth so he's here this morning open his door have to drive i believe two or three hours down here just to support and to be a blessing to this church so he's gonna take his liberty we only have one service don't put a time limit on

glad that the lord healed me save me filled me with the holy ghost gave me all these promises and i've got a new land i'm going to hallelujah i'm getting ready to receive a new body if it had not been for him where would we be amen but oh my thank god for his promises amen amen i got a one of my daughters over there that was born without a hip socket had no hip a socket there and doctor says that she needed surgery and if if uh even if she had surgery she'd be walking with the lymph and we brought her home in a brace and so we just began to pray we wouldn't accept what the doctor said that was nice of what he was saying and and according to the natural scientific uh yeah it was true what he was saying but we believed in the word of the lord and and we began to pray and so we took her to a specialist uh that they had scheduled for us and and um to see if they could do the operation and all that and you know uh my i was out on the road evangelizing and and um my my wife took him in there and the doctor began to examine her leg and and pull around on it and he says i don't know something's wrong here so he he says i'll be right back so he brought in another doctor and and he uh working on her and testing her and we had the x-rays uh that there was no hip socket and they said well we're gonna have to do x-ray of our own and done the x-ray and there was a hip socket right there and i don't know god the creator is still alive and well amen still alive i got got just so many testimony and testimony after what god has done and they've come too late to tell me that god doesn't exist that god isn't real and amen the lord is just so wonderful and i know there's testimonies here this morning that we could all just testify all day long of what god has done and still can't tell at all amen the lord is so good amen praise the lord if you have your bibles we're going to turn to first peter and like to say is it's just a real honor to stand before you this morning and to uh preach the gospel and i i appreciate your pastor for extending the invitation to come and we've certainly been uh upholding uh you all in our prayer and uh just so grateful to see the lord just uh working among you and really enjoyed what your pastor had to say this morning and and uh tell you what we're living in a treacherous hour aren't we amen but you know the prophet already warned us of these things and so it's it's not anything that really uh surprises us uh uh or or sets us back we've already been warned and prophet said we're sailing through treacherous waters amen and um so so we just got to keep our head uh looking upward amen because we know the coming of the lord is very soon amen and i appreciate my family my wife and children some of my children here and uh we certainly love and appreciate them and but uh we want to turn to first peter the fifth chapter and um before we go in to the the reading of the word may we just bow our heads and talk to our lord for just a few moments here father lord we're so thankful for the opportunity to come and speak to your people lord it's it's just an honor and to be with your redeemed and lord these people you loved even more than yourself for you gave your own life you gave your own blood the prophet even made the statement a few times that if i had a little cup a charger the the the literal blood of our lord jesus just a couple drops how precious and how sacred that would be that we would hold it to where we couldn't wouldn't spill it and we'd treasure it but lord how much greater sins sitting before us is your blood and that's the redeemed father your blood shed for the people and oh god we're so glad to be a part of the redeemed of the lord and i pray father that you would come in a special way and anoint the gift that you placed within me god and help me to yield to you and may you anoint the seed that's in the people father that they could yield to you as well and any spirit that would try to hinder we ask that you'd drive that thing away this morning lord that we would have the freedom in you god we just ask it in your lovely name jesus christ and the church says man and a man but uh first peter 5 and we're going to start at maybe the the sixth verse and it says humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of god that he may exalt you in due time casting all your care upon him for he careth for you be sober be vigilant because your adversary the devil as a roaring lion walketh about seeking whom he may devour i want to just read part of that ninth whom resist steadfast in the faith resist steadfast in the faith amen you can have your seats this morning and may the lord just bless the reading the ministering of the word this morning and i i've been kind of on a series uh back home and and by the way our uh the church greets you in the name of the lord and and uh but the uh the series that i've been on is what we wrestle against and i'd like to maybe just take part of that this morning and speak to you and trust that it'll it'll be a blessing in some way but you know uh there i i think that sometimes uh people get the wrong idea of christianity and they they think that christianity is a carefree life a life without trouble a life without you know heartaches and and it seems to be the popular uh thought idea that is presented to the world uh but our our opening scripture there addresses believers they're not addressing anyone but but believers and and christians who are holy ghost-filled amen and the prophet said when you get the holy ghost you're just beginning your your troubles uh are just starting now now i'm not saying that christianity is bad but it's the best life you could ever live but at the same time we we do face troubles ain't that right and and christians have struggles amen as they sojourn in this life and it's it's not that we struggle to to live a christian life it's it's not that we struggle to love our lord how many loves the lord how many glad you're a christian so so the the struggle is is not there uh we we do not struggle to possess a desire to to serve him it's it's really not that we struggle to be sold out uh to him i i don't think that you would be here today uh uh if if you really didn't love the lord and actually you could not be a christian uh unless you are sold out to him lock stock and barrel in other words your whole being you you've got to be sold out or you really couldn't be a christian amen and and we we we couldn't we couldn't be filled with the holy ghost if if we weren't a believer amen for the prophet says when god recognizes that faith amen then he gives us the seal of the holy ghost that he has recognized our faith so it's not that you have to beg god for the holy ghost it's not that you have to you know plead and and and fast 50 days in order to get the holy ghost the holy ghost comes when god recognizes your faith so so how many's got the holy ghost amen so you got the holy ghost so that we're not struggling to believe this morning amen we we've got that anchor because god wouldn't have given you the holy ghost if he did not recognize the faith amen and the prophet says faith is something that's born in you it's something that god gives you amen so so we do not struggle to believe in god and we do not struggle amen with his word yet christians struggle christians wrestle ain't that right for that's what paul said we wrestle amen it's it's it's something there and and we all have an adversary and and it's it's the same adversary but yet it's a personal adversary for the the peter said in our opening scripture that it's your adversary he just didn't say the adversary or a adversary he said he's your adversary so it's a personal warfare it's a personal battle it's a personal enemy that is come after you and yet we all have the same enemy but see we're all made up of different personalities we're made up of different likes where we we're we've all made up differently and satan knows exactly what to hit you on he knows how to come at you he knows all about you he intimately knows who you are as an individual if you have complexes that's where the devil's going to come if if you have if you have uh issues in some ways a circumstances well that's where the devil's going to try to sneak in amen but in other he's your adversary can you say amen amen so so uh the warfare amen has never been so great as it has in this age here amen and the prophet uh spoken here christ is revealed in his own word he said now where i come to the conclusion to talk on this was because that knowing that what we say we mustn't just say because we're gathered together just to haphazardly speak on anything but it's something that will help stabilize the people for we are going he says we're going to pass through dangerous treacherous waters and we're already sailing through them now and sometimes i guess with like it is with me and and must be with you that is so much of it is so scary amen and and we can we can we can say that's true amen everything around us it just seems frightening and and even the bible says that men's hearts would fail them for fear who would have ever thought that we're fighting this virus and who would ever thought that were where the country is in the shape that it's in and the church is in the shape that it's in who would have ever thought that you all would be in the condition that you are now can you say amen amen but it's a treacherous hour hey we're sailing through dangerous waters now the prophet said that 55 years ago amen and and also in the message the greatest battle ever fought in 62 he said i believe that the greatest battle that was ever thought is now ready to go in action i believe that god has been selecting his soldiers do you believe god selected you god has been selecting his soldiers amen and i believe he's been dressing them he's been training them and the battlefront is now set getting ready to start now he made that statement about 58 years ago amen and here we are as a selected soldier amen not knowing what to do no no no we know what to do because god has trained us through the message of the hour we know how to handle ourselves we know how to stay stable we know how to stay anchored amen the winds are going to blow the critics are going to come everything is coming against us and we're living in this dark hour and thank god we've been selected by god and trained by god amen to know how to amen to confront the battle amen at hand amen that's right now the prophet says this he said now people don't believe in demons this day can you imagine that amen but the thing to do to my opinion is know your enemy can you say amen know your enemy amen he says know your enemy and train for the contest that you're going to have when you meet him not if you meet him when you meet him he said because you're going to meet him can you say amen now it ain't just your pastor going to meet him you young people are going to meet him mamas and daddies are going to meet him uncles and aunts are going to meet him grandpa's are going to meet him can you say amen the preacher is going to meet him you're going to meet him and know him know what his strength is and then you train for this contest when you do meet him for it's one thing sure you're going to meet him so you train for this contest now he says now training for a contest is just like a boxer his enemy that he's going out to meet out there in a contest to fight a real good fighter usually knows and studies his opponent he studies his licks knows what he's fighting where he fights at see whether he leans forward he hangs back he fights right-handed left-handed he studies all of this and if he's a good smart fighter he gets him a sparring partner that'll fight just like his opponent fights for he knows all of his licks when he gets to that place can you say amen now i want to tell you about our enemy the devil wants to devour us ain't that right he wants to devour you amen that's right john 10 and 10 says the thief cometh not but for to steal to kill and to destroy can you say amen amen the christian life is is the greatest life but that doesn't mean you live this life at ease for he comes to kill steal and destroy can you say amen now you think of that because i've i've thought well why doesn't people just walk away from the messages just leave us alone amen because they're anointed of a spirit that wants to take you away that wants to take you out that wants to discourage you that wants to confuse you amen that wants to amen desire you can you say amen he wants to desire you young people amen he wants to desire the preacher he wants to desire every ounce of us and that word devire is to swallow you up to gulp you entirely can you say amen so understand that that the devil our adversary wants to bring us to a place to where there is nothing left of us to where we're just a has-been amen to wear everything is a memory i remember when i i remember when i was under that anointing i remember when i walked with god he it doesn't care of the fact that you still in church as long as you don't have an experience with god as long as you ain't got the joy you used to have as long as your faith isn't as strong as it used to be can you say man he wants to devour you and age is no concern of him amen gender is no concern to him family that you belong to is no concern to him then you think well then why doesn't he just leave me alone amen why doesn't he leave the church alone amen well ii thessalonians 2 4 speaking of that devil our adversary says he opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called god or that is worshipped so that he as god sitteth in the temple of god showing himself that he is god can you say amen the warfare ain't out in the bar the warfare ain't out in the prostitutes the warfare is in the church can you say amen for he opposeth he opposeth god and he opposes anything that has to do with god he opposeth anything amen that has the name of god can you say amen amen he's opposing because he wants to exalt himself above god ain't that right and that word opposeth is means repugnant which means to stubbornly resist amen so you take a step he's going to stubbornly resist you every step you take he's going to resist you every growth you have he's going to resist you every triumphant battle you have he's there to resist you and he's going to resist you in every way possible he wants to get you sidetracked off the promise of god can you say amen that's right now notice ephesians 6 11 put on the whole armor of god that you may be able to stand against the wiles or trickery of the devil now the prophet said he's a slickster so you better watch him he's the greatest deceiver man has ever had and and the deception is in the most the greatest deception is in this age he deceived eve and look what it done to the world but that was in its infant stage to what the deception is today so you've got to be able to put on the whole armor of god that you can stand against this deception that you can stand against his trickery amen of the devil for he is our adversary right for we wrestle not against flesh and blood it's not the individual that we're wrestling against amen it's not mama that we're wrestling against he's not the preacher that we're wrestling against it's it's not the people around us our friends amen see it's it's it's a devil that we're wrestling against do you believe that now notice he says see we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against powers against the rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places now you just bear with me as we go on now amen because i find this interesting that paul puts this in the book of ephesians amen it's written in the book of ephesians and what does ephesians mean to us when you study amen the the paradox you study the messages uh adoption you study their messages and the prophet says the book of ephesians parallels the book of joshua can you say amen amen see so what what uh and the book of joshua deals with the dividing up and setting in order the overcome ones and the book of joshua is a book of redemption but it deals with the second part of redemption now exodus is a book of redemption but it's dealing with the first part of redemption see those two parts of redemption there's coming out and there's going into can you say amen you see god didn't just call you out or something there's a position for you to come into there's a land that is ordained for you there's a place that he's called you to come to can you say amen that that's right so there's two parts of that redemption coming out of and going into and the book of joshua is dealing with the people of god coming into their inheritance ain't that right amen so i'm glad for the book of ephesians amen because it's dealing with our inheritance that paul in that ephesians is telling us you better watch it because you're not wrestling against flesh and blood there's going to be a warfare when you come into your inheritance there's going to be a warfare and it's in positions amen that is high it's a power it's a dominion it's a it's an authority that you're wrestling against so it's dealing with the people of god coming into their inheritance in joshua by inspiration divided the land and allotted it to each man placing the people where they belong hallelujah and notice this book of ephesians is to a certain group of people those who are in christ jesus the ones who are setting in heavenly places that's the position of the believer those who god foreknew he called and then he called he predestinated and then he predestinated he already glorified he ain't that right so these are the ones amen that are wrestling against the principalities powers and strongholds so indeed ephesians deals with us entering in to our position and our inheritance now you have to remember it was not moses that took the people over moses was law moses was condemnation ain't that right moses could not bring the people into their promise it took a joshua to bring them over and joshua is the one that had the message of grace amen joshua was one that that dealt with predestination the law can only put you in amen the pawn shop he can only put you in jail but it couldn't bring you out but here come a message of grace that said hold it hold it hold it i know they're in jail but i see them before the foundation of the world and i know they have a place they have a land that rightfully belongs to them hello amen so moses represented the law which was the church age amen dispensation amen joshua represented the dispensation of grace now as long as the people were in the wilderness they didn't have to fight because they did not own the land amen they didn't fight their battles amen because the land wasn't theirs ain't that right they walked through the land of esau that god said hold your peace this isn't your inheritance this belongs to esau you just keep on walking ain't that right they walked through the land of mohab man but god says hold your peace this isn't your land i've given you another land this is moab's portion amen i've got another place for you can you say amen amen see god didn't give them i let that land to possess and i want to say this there's things that god did not give you a man to possess that others are possessing can you say amen others are coming into their land and you might look and say well they're getting blessed look at them but don't you look at them don't you fuss with him don't you fight with him you've got another portion [Music] are you with me the land of canaan didn't belong to them that belonged to thee it belonged to you the land of the promised land did not belong to moab it did not belong to esau it belonged to the elect of god praise the lord now the land the promised land was across the river ain't that right and it was legally their inheritance amen and i believe this is where we are today i believe that brother branham's ministry is the ministry of joshua now i know i know brother brown said joshua is jesus but you can't separate jesus from this message jesus christ is the message can you say amen jesus christ is the message of grace jesus christ is the very one that anointed this prophet amen to call out the elect of god god knew his own can you say amen brother branham didn't know who the elect of god was god knew who the elect of god was that's right amen and i believe brother branham's ministry is a type of the joshua ministry amen for the sole purpose of carrying us over into the land of promise and positioning us i want to tell you there was the first pool that was great there was the second pool that was good but there's a third pool that is our land [Music] now brother branham said the third pool is the opening of the word in other words this book is open to the elect we're understanding our place we're understanding our inheritance we're understanding where we come from we're understanding where we're going we understand there's a new heaven there's a new earth there's a millennium there's a body change that is coming it's in our land well it's true see the open book is our land of promise we're talking of adoption now can you say amen amen that's right now it's in this age that we are now claiming coming to claim our land that is ours by inheritance god gave it to us are you with me see we're not just looking at this as bible stories anymore we're not looking at these things as just a history book and say well i'm glad god done what he done for daniel i'm glad for what god done for the hebrew boys now we're looking at it as our inheritance basically we were looking at and said mama it's me this is me that's right now notice but this land it it's a it's a it's a territory that satan has dominated and inhabited for so long even though it doesn't belong to him amen you realize before the book was open men had probed and tried and they tried to understand the book and there's many people still trying to understand the book because it's not open unto them it's opening to the elect ain't that right so satan is a poacher he's he's a squatter now notice again what you're wrestling against you're wrestling against principalities which is governments you're wrestling against powers the prophet said spiritual powers against the rulers of this darkness which is the devil he controls he controls the world he controls the democracy he he controls politics he controls culture he controls education he controls science he controls religion and against spiritual wickedness in high places the prophet said big places great places see so so we're not wrestling some little peel we we're we're not coming against some little weakling because that's not your position i hope you understand see he's ruling in the position that belonged to you you were made to rule not the devil you were made god over this earth not the devil you were made to control the winds not the devil you were made control to control things not the devil can you say amen see but satan dominates with power and authority he's controlled the world and dominates in the political realm dominates he controls the nature he's the one that causes typhoons he's the one that because it's a perversion of control of authority amen you were made to settle it down just like the prophet said when eve was walking through the garden and they were walking through the garden she said oh honey it's it's cool the wind's cold and he says oh he says don't worry he win be still but satan takes that wind and he creates typhoons he creates hurricanes ain't that right he he calls his blizzards he's the one that does these things and and and that's why there'll be nothing like that in the new earth amen see he's the one that's dominating and and and and we look even when jesus was going across the the the sea of galilee i believe it was and uh to help that man of gatteri amen in the middle of the sea the wind began to pick up and the waves began to amend to roar and and and it almost sunk the ship and the prophet said see satan got into that and was trying to destroy jesus trying to drown the ship can you say amen that's right see amen see so we're not wrestling against flesh and blood and we're not wrestling against someone that is just so weak and helpless and and all these things if you notice in the book of isaiah the 14th chapter the bible says that satan has determined and said within himself that he would exalt his throne above the stars of god now the prophet said that's the sons of god bear with me now satan has set in his heart amen to set his throne and establish his authority over the sons of god i i can't help but believe that he wants to dominate over the children of god you believe that that's why you've got to be sober vigilant because he's seeking to establish his kingship over you and for years he has done that he has indoctrinated us he has plagued us he has made us his slaves if he said dance we'd say how high or how long whatever he said we were at his bidding how many has ever dealt with habits in your life what is it it's a control ain't that right now your adversary he wants to dominate our soul our spirit our mind he wants to dominate our body you with me he wants to dictate you in every way possible think that right now you don't break from his power just because you go to church i i'm reminded of pharaoh amen when moses come with the message of deliverance and he said let my people go pharaoh said all right i'll let you go you can go out in the wilderness for three days but you got to leave something behind you got to come back now that's the way a lot of folks in the church are they've gone so far but satan still has a control on their life but you see moses come with the message of total deliverance [Applause] joshua came with the message of total deliverance that's why the doubters could not enter into the promised land because they were looking at the giants and saying they're too big for us god didn't want that attitude coming into the promised land you you you cannot come into this message and wholly believe the message with unbelief let's just preach you you you can't come and have this message totally affect your life when you still doubting i believe that this message of the hour is calling for a total deliverance a total separation from unbelief i don't care what devil you're facing i don't care what your trial is i'm telling you god has called for a total deliverance a total triumph can you say amen now see so you you you've got to understand that god sent a prophet with the message of deliverance ain't that right that's right amen now we we look moses or pharaoh amen it was going to have to relinquish every bit of his power over the children of god when moses come with the message it wasn't a bargain with pharaoh it was a command let my people go any control you have over their mind let them go any control you have over their soul let them go any control you have over their thoughts let them go any control you have over their body let it go ain't that right you see it's more than just coming into church see god has called us to come into our land that has been predestinated for us i hope this all right it's more than just coming to church it's more than just having holiness standards we believe in holiness don't we i hope you do but it's more than that amen people have you know we we get some that believe in holiness so much that they make it a legalist message that's not deliverance that actually binds the people this is a message of grace and we believe in holiness but if holiness was our land then we would have stayed with wesley under the message of sanctification i'm glad for the restoration of the gifts of pentecost but that's not my land if that was my land i would stay there now they're trying to get us go back to that spot that's not my land well are you with me [Applause] if our land was just the restoration god wouldn't have sent a prophet but god sent a prophet with a joshua ministry to open the land hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah you see satan's been able to not to dominate he dominated him that in the wesleyan h he dominated in the lutheran age you say well i don't know about that then why did they go back to denominations he was able to dominate they weren't able to break all the way free amen from satan's onslaught he dominated in that pentecostal church look at the pentecostal church today they've lost their holiness they've lost all convictions they they're stealing the titles they've lost their power their young people ain't getting the holy ghost they've gone to man-made programs so it did not break them from satan's dominion because that wasn't the land of promise but here comes a joshua ministry not just to lead us around another age he said there's no more ages to come can you say amen this is the time for the people to cross over never to be dominated by sin again never to go back wandering in the wilderness again this is our land of promise young people i hope you understand this is our land of promise you realize that now you can take the book you see i was in the pentecostal age raised under the pentecostal message there was so much confusion about this book yes we had the bible but there was so much confusion because we didn't know what scriptures belonged to us we didn't know what it was talking about we knew that god loved us but we didn't know this was a love story satan beat us all the time if we didn't feel having some emotion we felt lost if we weren't kicking our heels we felt lost we felt condemned we didn't understand that god's love for us is forever it's permanent whether i feel him or whether i don't feel him whether i feel victory or whether i don't feel victory whether i feel god's love for me or whether i don't feel god's love he loves me i didn't know the scriptures oh we quoted the scriptures but i couldn't apply them to me but then here comes the opening of the word now i'm able to look at every page and see myself in the book i can take healing from my i don't have to take the doctor's words the doctor said you're going to die no i'm not i've got an open book now i can personally claim my inheritance do you realize there's a people on this earth that's never going to die they're ready for a rapture [Applause] it's an open book satan has broke his power if god will break the power of your soul why can't he break the power of your body if god can break the power over your very soul to where satan cannot possess you any longer why can't he break the power over your mind i know we're living in a world of insanity but that don't have to be you i know we're living in a world of darkness but you're the children of the light darkness can never affect you well praise the name of the lord it's an open book [Music] now notice satan's power came by way of sin and what is sin what is it satan's power come by way of unbelief unbelief do you realize he still finds his power that way he still finds his power through the unbeliever the moment you doubt the book the moment you doubt the promises satan gains his power over your life well are you with me the moment you start believing that victory ain't yours what just might as well just know victory ain't yours but if you believe that victory is yours if you believe you're going to come out you're going to come out it's just the truth now notice he finds his power so he is in the position to rule and to dominate but that position is rightfully yours as long as adam was in that position then satan could not dominate he couldn't express the power that he had ain't that right but he when he got man to fall then he came to power and dominion see satan does not want to give it up he does not want to yield that authority over to you are you with me now i'm thinking of this past election we ain't gonna get in politics so don't throw your tomatoes but here we've got the struggle for power we got one saying it's rightfully mine we've got the other and saying no it's not i belong in the white house and it's a struggle for position ain't that right now it's going to go to the courts and the courts are going to decide what is what ain't that right but you see it's just like us we're coming to power but our power isn't some some republican or democrat power our power is not belonging into england so we're not trying to dethrone the king or the queen or whoever we're not trying to amen get putin out of his place because that's not our power our power is where the devil's at our power is there and we're saying hold it that is rightfully mine i fell from that position i'm made to rule over the devil not the devil rule over me and he is trying to say no no no no i've been in this position for thousands of years how dare you try to come into my and take me over but see our our it ain't going to the courts of america god has already said it it's already been final god has laid claim and said hold it this is the relaxed position the devil has nothing to do but to relinquish his power it's your right it's your inheritance because god himself gave it to you oh i hope you get it it's i'm so glad that when i get i can tell my children i could tell my wife hold it you know you're the victor you're the victor but i'm not giving it because i'm their daddy i can say hold it god said you're the victor god said you're the overcomer god said you can rule over this thing teenagers i know you're going through some battles but god said you're the ruler over it you don't have to go out in that world you don't have to hey man go out and be a drug addict and a smoke act victim and get caught up in your marriage and messed up you can look at the devil and say devil i've had enough of you parents can look and say devil let go of my daughter let go of my son let go of my family it's not yours any longer we are coming back to authority of what rightfully belongs to me you believe you got power even over the devil in this church yes you do but people come united together and such at one the devil ain't got no strength in the church when the people get behind their pastor pray for the pastor and the pastor amen staying prayed up and loving the people and stand with this message of the hour satan ain't got a chance in a congregation why we are a people that's called to rule we are a people of the land of inheritance you love him now we're coming in to take our position satan's been in this power this position for many years and notice notice how it keeps it he is the accuser of the brethren everybody say he is the accuser of the brethren who puts them thoughts of condemnation in you the devil does who keeps throwing his past to your past that you the devil does who keeps reminding you of your past the devil does he's an accuser and what happens we begin to believe it i've been there i've been wearing just praising god at work and then just the thoughts of my past and before you know it my hands start getting down i start silencing my song and before you know it i start meditating and before you know it i start all over again lord please forgive me oh jesus if you just forgive me oh god help me i'm so sorry that well that ain't a life of faith you see i've already confessed it under the blood i don't need to put it back under the blood it's the devil that keeps reminding me can you say amen that now i can see myself in the book and i see that he's a loser i i he reminds me of my past i remind him of his future and i remind him of who i am i'm not a fallen downtrodden sinner i am a son of god and i'll never be a sinner in the sight of god again you realize that once you're ever filled with the holy ghost you're sealed to the day of your redemption god will never look at you as a sinner again now let's just let's just preach for a moment let's just talk god will never look at you as a sinner again quit looking at yourself as a sinner see we're coming to a land of inheritance and while satan is reminding us of egypt we're already out of egypt we're not part of that world we found out we're not part of that world are you with me so i understand the bible says that men's hearts are failing them for fear that that does not apply to me i'm not of that part that's not my portion of land my land is of faith my land is of authority my land is a is a position that i cast out the devil [Music] do you believe you have that authority to cast out devils well apparently you don't i said do you believe that you yourself is in the authority and position to cast out devils it isn't just a preacher it can be your what you moms it could be you young people can i say it this way you can still cast out devils even in your deepest trials because your trials doesn't affect you as sonship you're a son and daughter of god regardless you could be in the bottom of hell and not feel the presence of god and steal that dominion and authority still lives in you to where you can say satan get your hands off my get your hands off me get your hands off my family get your hands off my church get your hands off of anything that belongs to me it's an authority as a son whether you feel like it or not we don't go by emotion we go by what's in the book i hope this is all right [Music] caleb 80 year old that means 80. anyone got any 180 maybe not good i've got some 80 year old saints in my church now they're little feeble you know they're walking in you're thinking bless their little hearts but caleb had 80. says give me my mountain now i i'm going to tell you something as an 80 year old he did not feel like a 20 year old i guarantee he had symptoms as an 80 year old would but see he was not looking to his symptoms he was not looking how he felt he was not looking at his feebleness he was not looking how weak he was he was looking at the promise of god and church is time to start looking at the promise of god i don't care how dark it is look through the promise i don't care how impossible it seems look to the promise i don't care how ugly it is look to the promise it's dark but look to the promise i'm feeble i can't make it another day look to the promise [Applause] look to the promise and you say amen now satan is the accuser of the brethren so he's trying to make his case that we are unworthy of this position he makes the case that we are unfit and we're misfits he makes us a case amen as to why we are not worthy he makes this case as to why we should remain discouraged he makes his case as to why we should remain powerless and defeated and hopeless amen he makes this case as to why we should be mentally deranged when it comes to the promises of god but listen the only way he could keep the position is if redemption price had not been met i know this is simple but i'm trying to make it simple for you i want to just explain what a redemption is i had a dog it was a corgi you all know where corgi is little oh long body somehow it got bred with a labrador and it had pups and they were so cute we just gave them away we didn't tell people we didn't even know what they were bread too we just knew she had pups we have a little old town and we gave him one to the store owner of a grocery store and he really liked that pup but one day he came to me said what kind of pup did you give me what kind of dog cause i don't know what part of it's corgi i said why he said well the thing can't even bark now i i drove by his house one day and his his grass was a little high and i see this long body just like a golden or a lab long tail and short legs he's moving around in the grass you can't even see his legs look like he was just floating i thought oh my goodness i hope i never see him again people made fun of my corgi but i liked her but she would get out a lot when we go to the store like i said we lived in a small town about 2 000 people but she would literally run to the store and when we'd come out there she was and and so everybody knew that you know this dog but anyway she showed up missing one day called her ginger ginger showed up missing you know and showed up missing and uh disappeared we we uh didn't see the dog for a while a few days and so we got to wondering where's ginger so i called the dog pound and they said y'all we got we got gender i said all right so i told my wife i said honey i'm gonna go i'm gonna go there and get ginger now at that moment i become redeemer why because see redemption means to bring back back so my wife my wife could be uh she could be happy and at rest because i didn't say i was gonna go shop i said i'm gonna go get ginger i'm gonna redeem so i wasn't gonna come back with a doverman pincher or a pit bull i wasn't gonna come back with any other dog but ginger so i walk into this deal and there's big old dogs i mean now that's a man's dogs you know not little old ginger man dog man they're growling but ginger see if she understood where i was coming from she could be at rest too maybe she felt intimidated by these big dogs and said oh my oh my if he ever sees these other dogs he'll forget about me oh my they're so much bigger they're so much more talented they're so much more beautiful and muscular and handsome and all that they're so much more attractive but see if she could understand my position and my mind i didn't come to shop for other dogs i come to redeem so the other dogs get out bar currents the other dogs could outgrowl her the other dogs get out and smart her or whatever but ginger was safe because i come to redeem now i thought of that because see when jesus come he didn't come to shop he didn't come to this earth to shop around he come to redeem now i look at another thing i bought my wife some some dishes a while back and and we we we have young people over and my boys and their boys these other boys got to wrestling in the kitchen and they broke a glass of that i bought just bought my wife that day i believe but it broke and it just shattered all them pieces now i said no don't worry honey i'm going to go get you another glass don't worry i'm going to replace that but see that's not redeeming that's replacing i could not redeem that because it was shattered i had not the power to bring it back i had to go shop not shop for just for something new i i went to shop to replace but see he didn't come to replace he come to redeem and no matter how bad you're broken and no matter how bad you're shattered god is able to put all the pieces back together and that's why i'm here today i ain't got a good life story my past ain't the greatest but i can tell you this the redeemer came one day and began to work on my life and what seemed to be impossible i thought i had no future but he gave me a future and he said every promise in the book is yours you've got it it's yours to claim do i feel worthy no he made me worthy [Applause] he redeemed me i was in his mind from the beginning now the old accuser says oh but but you see you've done this and you've done that and you've you're but he redeemed me can you say amen so now if you'll just bear with me for a few more moments if the price of redemption was not paid we could not entirely absolutely claim our inheritance but i believe with all my heart that the the price of redemption has been paid it's been paid not only for your soul but for your body your mind your spirit your entire being oh are you with me now notice brother brown says all jesus works was complete everything was complete totally delivered he totally delivered the leper from leprosy he totally delivered the woman with the issue of blood from her issue he totally delivered the world from sin when he died that that day at of the atonement he totally delivered every sin he delivered the church so there's no need this is joshua ministry there is no need for us to live underprivileged people there is no need for us to live in a defeated state because he defeated the devil he took all the principalities and powers and subdued them under his feet and they have no legal rights over you does this help you they have no legal rights to rule over you anymore we are christians filled with the holy ghost we don't have to have the devil to dictate us christ delivered us total deliverance he delivered us from evil delivered us from sin delivered us from habits delivered us from talking delivered us from black guard delivered us from all kinds of smutty things he totally delivered us and put us into his holy hands a complete total deliverance what's he looking to he's looking at calvary and seeing a total complete deliverance can you say amen amen now he says the title deed to the earth and to eternal life adam forfeited for wisdom instead of faith and the book that the title deed went back to its original owner which is god so satan couldn't get his filthy hands on it he could not legally claim it ain't that right now in the book of revelations the fifth chapter we see god sitting amen on the throne with the title deed in his hands waiting for redemption claims think of it waiting god waiting he's been under expectation now we've all it in some way or another been under expectation maybe of a vacation or maybe of a baby coming or marriage or whatever but we've been excited being under expectation notice god was under expectation and for the sons of god to come back to their position this is the day that god has been waiting on do you believe that and i don't believe that there's a people on this earth that's going to disappoint him god ain't going to be disappointed because you have been selected for this age to come back to your position of authority [Music] are you with me you ain't going to make excuses now i know the devil's throwing things that are dark at you but see there's a way for you to come back to position and that's where you're going to now notice god provided being jehovah jireh he provided himself a lamb by being the lamb himself revelations 5 1 and i saw in the right hand of him that said on the throne a book written within and on the backside sealed with seven seals and i saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice who is worthy to open the book and to loose the seals thereof no man in heaven nor in earth neither under the earth was able to open the book neither to look there on and i went much because no man was found worthy to open and to read the book neither to look there on ain't that right so he's weeping he's sad he's because the opening of the word meant much it well brother branham says i think he went because if no one was worthy could open this book of redemption all creation was lost ain't that right which meant that satan would maintain his position would maintain his control amen and we would all amen be have one destiny and that was hell we would all remain under the bondage of satan we would all would not stand a chance amen to even come against him amen at all can you say amen amen if the book the abstract title deed wasn't open then man would forevermore be under the control and dominion of satan because uh he would uh uh a man would never be able to lay claim to what he fell from can you say amen that's right amen we would go to church but church wouldn't mean nothing we would talk about uh calvary that calvary wouldn't mean nothing we'd talk about heaven but heaven wouldn't mean nothing because we could not lay claim to them promises except the book be open i hope you understand because you cannot lay claim to anything except by faith i know you know we could we could we could take series of these things but you can't you can't like you can't claim your healing except by faith you can't claim a new body except by faith you can't claim victory except by faith well see god doesn't want you just wondering well i know he's saved i understand he died but does it for me i know he heals but is it for me i know there's a rapture but is it for me you know you can't go that way you got to know that healing is for you you've got to know these things so if the book wasn't opened then we could not have faith now notice but the prophet said here's the book here's the title deed it'll be offered to the kinsmen redeemer that can meet the qualification that's god's own law and he cannot defy his law see god required a kinsman redeemer who was worthy who was able to do it who had the substance to do it and the angel said now let that kinsmen redeemer step forward john looked he looked all over the earth he looked beneath the earth and there was nobody their creation was lost everything of course john wept but his crying didn't last but just a minute though for the fifth verse says and one of the elders saith unto me weep not ain't that right this ain't the time to weep this isn't the time to mourn this isn't time to be discouraged can you say amen behold the lion of the tribe of judah the root of david have prevailed to open the book and to loose the seven seals thereof now what is john seeing he is seeing a resurrected christ ain't that right and he knew that jesus was alive because he had seen him come and do a work now notice the bible or the prophet the well the bible says john is caught up on the lord's day do you believe he's in this day he was in this day looking at what was transpiring can you say amen now jesus christ has been sealed up for almost 2 000 years with denominational tombs are you with me the prophet said the holy spirit has been bound by these denominational rivers for almost 2 000 years but is to be loosed in the evening time by the evening time message the holy spirit back in the church again christ himself revealed in human flesh in the evening time now we know why to open the book and to give you your inheritance hello give you your inheritance we didn't see that in the pentecostal age but in this age we've seen a resurrected christ come forth and open the book that's right see notice he saw the lamb and he come and took the book out of the right hymn that set up on the throne ain't that right now this theme of the message of this hour is that jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever it's a resurrected christ living among us again he was dead but he's alive forevermore brother brown said what a resurrection that was speaking of 2000 years ago and what a resurrection this is why it's jesus christ in the bride [Music] amen this is one of the things that john or jesus revealed to john i was dead and am alive forevermore ain't that right and it's one of the things that god would show to the church and he has showed it in this age that he is resurrected from the denominational ages he is worthy to open the book we see him alive we see him real we see him as triumphant we see him as the mighty conqueror because he's opened the book and you say amen that's right it's proved to us that redemption price was paid now that that means something to us because people are saying that jesus is just a man critics are saying as well that it's just a figment of our imagination but in this day it's become more real to us than any other age amen because we understand if he hadn't been alive if he hadn't done the work of calvary if he hasn't wasn't worthy we would be lost forever but now we're finding our position not as mortal beings but as sons and daughters of god coming back to reign over sin over trial over sickness over anything can you say amen now notice revelations 10 1 i saw another mighty angel come down from heaven clothed with a cloud and a rainbow upon his head his face as it were the sun and his feet as pillars of fire and he had in his hand a little open book and he set his right foot upon the sea his left foot on the earth and he cried with a loud voice as when a lion roars and when he had cried the seven thunders uttered their voices ain't that right brother brown said the first thing that represented that redemption come the lamb that had been slain from the foundation of the world he took the book opened the book tore off the seals sent it down to the earth to his seventh angel to reveal it to his people why so you could come to your inheritance do you believe that bless his holy name when the book was open john the bible says he saw his himself in the book if i could find the quote right fast i'll i'll get ready to let you go amen but the prophet said john saw himself but i want to look at this because uh uh brother brown said now the lamb he sends the book to the seventh angel to reveal it to his people so what is revealed the abstract everybody say the abstract title deed that's what's been revealed brethren said what does abstract mean it means it searched all the way back to its beginning now notice he's reading from an abstract title deed an open book and notice what he says you never did it in the first place [Applause] it's a message of grace you never did it in the first place you are justified everybody say justified see so by the open book he gave us the true meaning of what justification really means you are justified in that you've never done it in the first place not forgiven remember the prophet said now you could go out and drink and you'd say i'm sorry and we'd say well we forgive you but see you couldn't be justified because you've done it but if i heard you went and drunk and i come up to you and says look brother i i forgive you for drinking you shouldn't have done that and you say well forgive me for what i've never done it ain't that right and the proof is there you've never done it so i could never forgive you because you're justified justification goes beyond forgiveness can you say amen so this redemption is not just god forgiven you this redemption is looking at the devil and saying no sin is being applied to him he's justified see because in the beginning you never had sin you never was a sinner in god's mind you never were scarred in god's mind you had never fell in god's mind so his redemption is to bring you back to what you was in his thoughts you never did it and began with that's the way he saw you i know i come as a sinner i know i was born in this world a sinner now you think of that i was born as a sinner all of us were how how how do you change it but he did i got scars to prove of what i've done wrong if we all stood here we'd scare each other of what our past was how do you change it but he did he so changed it that god never looks at you as a sinner your relationship with him is not god and sinner it's god and son god and redeemed that i can literally think of it now god can't forget the only thing that makes him forget is his blood [Music] his blood makes him forget so much so that when you or the devil tries to bring up your sins god looks this but what sins [Music] what sins are you talking about i don't know them are you with me you couldn't have fellowship under condemnation of sin so god takes the sins away you've never done it in the beginning [Applause] we're reading from an open book because the book is expressing god's thoughts that's why i took a lamb a lamb had to open the book a preacher couldn't open the book because he couldn't make you sinless a theologian couldn't open the book but when the lamb himself presented himself as a bloody bleeding lamb a kinsman redeemer he could open the book and god's mind was unfolded and he saw you innocent he saw you victorious and the devil is nowhere to be found in your book i hope it helps you who's missing did you read the book of revelation who's missing the devil when the lamb opens the book the devil ain't nowhere to be found he's lost he's lost his hold he's everything he he was the accuser of the brethren but he's no longer in that in that book he's no longer in the vision in the picture anymore now the book has been opened and sent down to a prophet now the book has opened and been read the prophet's reading from an open book looking in the open book and he said you're justified you've never done it in the first place you are the sinless virtuous bride of jesus christ in so much that you are miss jesus christ no wonder the devil is opposing you now if you can know who you are the prophet said if the bride could discern the two spirits within the framework of the church and know who she is she would be a what invincible army can you say amen so i want to tell you you're not defeated this morning you're not some downtrodden coincidence here this morning god selected jew for the age for his battle this battle but he gave you the weapon and that's an open book anytime satan says all you little peon say oh no no you don't understand i'm redeemed i'm a son of god i have every legal right young people you have every legal right hey man thinking of my son my daughter in law had had a headache the other day just really hurting they're driving home and she says honey would you pray for him in my head uh pray for me and my son just laid her his hand on her as their drive and say a father in the name of jesus christ i rebuked this headache in the name of jesus and that headache disappeared what is it it's an open book it's a people coming to claim their redemptive rights now the prophet said satan's a bluff if he can bluff you he said his only power is when he can bluff you into it he said if he can bluff you into taking your sickness then so be it you're sick but you don't have to be sick you don't have to be you you don't have to be defeated if you're sitting here this morning defeated it's because you're allowing the devil to defeat you i'm telling you it's an open book you want victory you can have victory you start walking start claiming your promise you want your family start claiming them you start walking the land it's your land [Applause] well praise the lord we're not a people whose hearts are filled with fear that's the world we are a people of an open book that's walking rock in our land who are you devil you think of it in zechariah when the bible talks about that headstone coming down jesus christ the headstone coming down on the body what was said what was declared who art thou o mountain which stands before zerubbabel thou shalt be made a plague so i declare to you mountain of sickness you gotta go this is the h you're going to be made a plane mountain of discouragement you got to go well start claiming your mountain church is there a caleb here that says give me my mountain because you can have it this is the age for it this is the age where the mountain doesn't stand before you and you just i just don't know no it's the age you stand as a son and daughter of god with that authority and say hold it i know what is rightfully mine he did not just die for my soul he died for my body he just didn't die for my body but i've got a claim to my family now there's promises there now that you can literally claim your family did not the prophet say you can do that you don't see your children go to hell you say a little bit preacher you don't understand it's a bad mess i don't care what mess it is you've been exalted to the highest position you're the bride of jesus christ you've got an authority you've got the greatest weapon against the enemy and that's the word of god and it's not a closed book it's not a sealed book it's an open book that tells you what right you belong to you [Applause] amen all right y'all know that song bless the lord o my soul oh my soul worship his whole leading the musicians will come sing like never before oh my soul i'll worship his holy name it again bless the lord o my soul o my soul worship his whole leading sing like never before oh my soul i'll worship his whole name oh the sun comes up it's a new

my soul worship hallelujah sing like never before oh my soul i worship his whole name oh bless the lord o my soul oh my soul worship oh do you have it in you to worship him lord sing like never before oh my soul our worship is whole as they just play softly i thought of that you know john brother brown said john saw himself and he said there's john i used to think that it was just maybe he saw his name on one page and he says oh yeah my name's in the book but i can't help i was just thinking about it a while back i can't help but think that maybe as every page was turned to the promises john began to see his name on every page i'm the lord god that healeth thee ah there's john behold i'll sin unto you elijah the prophet ah there's me that's me he was wounded for our transgressions and i could just see john seeing his name on there every promise john began to claim and see his name see every redemptive right belongs to the children of god and today you might say well i'm so glad that i'm saved i am just so glad but what about the other promises won't you take that same faith and use it and apply it for your healing won't you take that same faith and apply it to your family won't you take the same faith and apply it to any aspect in your life because the blood of jesus christ covers all sin it covers everything whether it's for your affliction whether i i just stand here by the grace of god and i i tell you i know i've seen the blind open i've seen the the blind eyes open i've seen the crippled walk i've seen the legs grow out me myself i'm a or i i just as a baby life left this body amen and and sitting in church and and they they've tried to feel paul's there was nothing there and my mom grabbed me and ran me she didn't call 9-1-1 she ran before the church and she said pray and the church gathered around and began to pray and god brought life into this body i'm so glad for his resurrection power his resurrection life but oh my amen but what what the prophet said whatever god leads you to believe that is yours so today i don't want you your faith to be hindered don't don't look at the circumstance say well i know god does it for everybody else but i just don't know i've been this i've been that look at yourself as the redeemed of god and see yourself in what god calls you to be can you lift your hands unto the lord and begin to worship him claim your mountain whatever needs you have this morning claim it hallelujah claim victory claim victory you need the holy ghost claimant hallelujah it's yours it's a promise of god hallelujah you need

dominating satan is god's called you to dominate take back what god has given to you you say well i've messed up i understand that we all mess up but there's a blood that keeps us covered that's what the prophet said amen confess your sins repent of your sin even get it under the blood and keep marching on there's a grace that is for you hallelujah hallelujah amen as we turn it to our pastor oh oh
