[5:26] how alone i was feeling

[5:38] to hide
[5:38] [Music]
[5:41] and though i laughed and said
[5:44] my life was fine without you
[5:50] i was covering up the secrets here's a
[5:56] quran oh
[5:59] then one day someone told me

[6:47] how you care
[6:50] and through your precious blood
[6:55] i found pardon thank you lord
[6:58] oh amazing
[7:09] [Music]
[7:12] let's do that last part again i want you
[7:14] to hear these words oh and my sins are
[7:19] washed and they're all washed away
[7:24] all masses are
[7:28] washed
[7:31] oh and yes it's true
[7:34] there been days when i have filled you
[7:41] lord you know the many times i've gone
[7:46] astray
[7:48] oh but i've learned your love is
[7:52] stronger than
[7:54] my witness thank you lord
[8:06] no one else has ever cared for me
[8:10] like you lord
[8:13] and other friends could never be
[8:17] as close to me
[8:21] or church i'm not
[8:37] oh i'm amazed
[8:43] that you love me church i'm amazed
[8:51] how you care
[9:01] [Music]
[9:06] are
[9:17] amen amen church this song is special to
[9:22] me
[9:24] i was born and raised in this message
[9:27] from a from a little child i was born
[9:29] and raised
[9:30] but i never knew god personally i never
[9:32] met him for myself
[9:34] and when we hear our pastor talk about
[9:36] what he's been teaching about when
[9:38] if you don't know god before your
[9:39] teenage years
[9:41] then satan really the door opens for
[9:43] satan to really get a hold of you and to
[9:45] think that i was born
[9:46] and raised in this message and a lot of
[9:48] parents and a lot of ministers and a lot
[9:50] of pastors will think that
[9:51] that's enough for a child but yet still
[9:53] when i reached those teenage years i
[9:55] didn't know god for myself
[9:58] and i struggled and i struggled and
[10:00] satan started to get a hold of my life
[10:02] and this song didn't become real to me
[10:04] until i met god personally
[10:06] i could have sang this song all through
[10:08] my kid years all the way up to 10 13
[10:11] 15 but it meant a whole lot more to me
[10:13] when i was 20
[10:15] because i realized that all my sins are
[10:18] washed away
[10:19] and i'm chosen i'm amazed that he loves
[10:21] me he could have loved so many other
[10:23] people he could have chose so many
[10:24] people more qualified
[10:26] but you look through the bible you look
[10:28] through time he always chose
[10:30] the sinners he went to the gutter and
[10:33] reached down and pulled you out
[10:35] he didn't chose he didn't choose the
[10:36] pharisees or the sadducees they might
[10:38] have known
[10:38] the bible from front to back and those
[10:41] weren't the ones he chose he chose the
[10:42] sinners
[10:43] because he can get glory out of the
[10:45] redemption of that sinner
[10:47] in church he chose us he chose us to be
[10:49] part of this bride
[10:51] for this age because he had confidence
[10:53] in us and like i said this song
[10:55] after the age of after my teenage years
[10:57] when god really got a hold of me
[10:59] this song became new to me this song
[11:00] became precious to me
[11:02] and we're just gonna do it one more time
[11:05] just the chorus one more time
[11:15] [Music]
[11:21] oh and my sins
[11:24] are washed they're all
[11:28] washed away all my sins
[11:33] are washed away one more time think of
[11:36] those words
[11:37] and my sins
[11:51] last time all my sins oh my sins are
[11:57] washed they're all
[12:00] washed away all my sins
[12:05] are rushed away
[12:09] thank you lord amen thank you lord
[12:14] thank you lord
[12:16] [Applause]
[12:19] i didn't receive no prayer requests this
[12:21] evening i don't know if someone some
[12:23] someone has something on their heart
[12:24] that they want to ask prayer for this
[12:25] evening
[12:26] brother greg amen we'll go ahead and
[12:30] take your testimony
[12:41] uh last weekend we took a long weekend's
[12:44] wife and i and my granddaughter
[12:48] and we left friday of course we we
[12:51] prayed before
[12:52] we left and we left friday went to
[12:54] charleston to see
[12:56] my stepson and from there we went we
[12:59] were going to beaufort
[13:00] spend the weekend when we left
[13:03] charleston going to beaufort
[13:05] on 26th there
[13:08] traffic was heavy it was
[13:11] they were probably going 80 90 miles an
[13:13] hour you know how people drive
[13:17] and my wife was driving and my
[13:20] granddaughter was right behind her
[13:22] and i was of course in the passenger
[13:24] seat
[13:25] and this truck came up
[13:28] on her on the right side and he was
[13:31] flying
[13:33] and uh he cut right in front of us how
[13:37] he
[13:37] missed us i have no idea
[13:41] but my wife told me now i didn't see
[13:43] this now she said
[13:45] she saw the rear of his trailer
[13:49] pass right through the front of the car
[13:52] and and
[13:56] that that had to be because how he
[14:00] i don't i have no idea how he missed us
[14:03] and if he would have hit us
[14:04] it would have swung that car around into
[14:07] oncoming traffic
[14:09] and it would have hit my wife and my
[14:11] granddaughter
[14:14] um and i just think that when the lord
[14:18] does something like that for us
[14:20] we need to we need to make it known
[14:24] you know and uh as i told her i said
[14:27] that's why
[14:29] when we go on a trip anywhere with the
[14:32] crazies on the road
[14:35] you just never know
[14:38] and i just i just wanted to thank the
[14:40] lord for that
[14:42] that he brought us back home safely
[14:45] thank you
[14:49] and then
[14:53] you know a car can get about that close
[14:55] to you without hitting you because
[14:57] that's
[14:58] that's about the width of an angel's
[14:59] wing so they can come that close
[15:02] but god's angels are protecting us and
[15:05] and uh
[15:05] you know if it's not meant for you to
[15:07] have that accident then something will
[15:09] just
[15:10] part the part the cars brother kelly did
[15:13] you have something
[15:16] amen amen
[15:19] [Applause]
[15:23] god bless you you know i was sitting
[15:25] there and i tell you the songs were
[15:26] definitely appropriate
[15:28] um have a testimony saints we um
[15:31] i guess last night i was supposed to go
[15:33] there to walmart i thought i was
[15:35] supposed to go
[15:36] and take back a return but i didn't go
[15:39] last night i waited
[15:40] uh until the lord told me to go he said
[15:43] to that so i told the wife
[15:45] i said well i'll just wait until
[15:46] tomorrow so when i went there
[15:49] today it was at a walmart in mooresville
[15:52] and it was uh i won't say
[15:56] the organization but they always
[15:59] asking for money paying for money and i
[16:01] said i wouldn't give him a brown penny
[16:03] so we got around there right and i came
[16:05] back and i came out of
[16:08] walmart and i was getting ready to go
[16:10] into walmart
[16:11] and one of the gentlemen that was with
[16:13] the organization
[16:15] he said hey you want to give to the
[16:17] organization so i turned and i looked at
[16:19] him i said
[16:20] come here for a minute come here so i
[16:23] said now
[16:24] tell me about this organization so when
[16:26] he told me about the
[16:28] about the organization i said do you all
[16:31] have bible study there
[16:33] and we said yeah we read our bible in
[16:35] the morning every morning for now i said
[16:37] okay
[16:38] i said now but you don't look like you
[16:40] should be out here
[16:42] like this and he was older gentlemen
[16:43] about 63
[16:45] and a man who was actually from augusta
[16:48] georgia
[16:49] so i was telling them we stayed there
[16:51] for about nine years and
[16:52] then all of a sudden i asked him i said
[16:54] okay um
[16:56] tell me about your salvation since you
[16:58] all have bible study
[17:01] he said what do you mean i said see
[17:05] that's why god sent you out here and
[17:07] that's why i'm here
[17:09] i said first you have to understand now
[17:12] you're having bible study
[17:13] and and i won't tell you about the
[17:16] scheme of the organization
[17:18] later on if you come to me privately i
[17:19] won't say it out like this
[17:21] but anyway i've seen them for years and
[17:24] i was telling them this is the first
[17:26] time i
[17:26] ever talked to anyone in this
[17:28] organization
[17:30] and he was telling me actually what they
[17:32] were doing
[17:33] and i talked to the gentleman i said you
[17:36] know i said well what are you really
[17:37] looking for he said you see my shoes
[17:39] he said look on the bottom of these
[17:41] shoes he said these shoes cost me a
[17:43] hundred and some dollars and he said you
[17:44] see
[17:44] he said i don't need no money i'm trying
[17:47] to get my salvation and get delivered
[17:50] from drugs
[17:51] he said that's the reason why i'm i'm
[17:53] really out here
[17:54] and i said you know what i believe god
[17:57] put us together nothing and not only
[18:01] he gave me his phone number him his name
[18:04] he gave me his home address
[18:05] he said you gonna be my mentor from here

[34:36] who really enjoy the song service and
[34:38] the musician
[34:39] if you would let's go to genesis chapter
[34:42] 12.
[34:43] we're going to pick up where we left off
[34:46] on sunday
[34:48] i hope everybody here over the majority
[34:51] of you
[34:52] already listen to the sermon on sunday
[34:55] right
[34:56] amen can i see your hands
[35:01] how many listen to the sermon on sunday
[35:04] okay blessed be the name of the lord
[35:07] if you're behind make sure you catch up
[35:10] amen
[35:11] because we are looking at the friendship
[35:14] and that opening between ahola
[35:18] and the assyrian amen
[35:21] you know a brother called me today we
[35:23] were fellowshipping just want to know
[35:25] how i was doing
[35:27] when he mentioned something to me he
[35:29] said i'm still listening to the old
[35:31] sermon
[35:32] about the third heaven the tree heaven
[35:36] and i told him i said probably we're
[35:38] going to start that sermon back over
[35:40] at zero and continue to climb back up
[35:44] and uh we finish our testimony our
[35:47] conversation
[35:48] and for the majority of the time what i
[35:51] preach here is already laying on the
[35:52] computer
[35:54] so i have sermons in that computer that
[35:56] are not preached yet
[35:58] so if you come and i pull one i begin to
[36:00] preach you think i was sitting with you
[36:03] or i was listening to your conversation
[36:05] somewhere they already laying back there
[36:08] amen then when i was sitting there there
[36:11] is something about that sermon
[36:13] we have not even touched that yet it's
[36:15] still on the computer
[36:17] that came back to me that needed to be
[36:20] incorporated tonight
[36:22] i said okay now i understand why the
[36:24] brother mentioned that he
[36:26] didn't even know why he told me that
[36:28] there is something in that sermon
[36:30] it's in the mystery of the tree heaven i
[36:32] have not even explained that yet
[36:35] so just stay tight because i'm gonna dig
[36:37] into that
[36:38] and come out amen but you stay alive
[36:42] amen let's go to genesis chapter 12.
[36:47] if you dare you can say amen let me see
[36:50] my time
[36:52] oh my god sandy head to rush with a
[36:56] different speed
[36:59] amen go back to
[37:02] genesis chapter 11 verse 31.
[37:06] i just want to grade something there so
[37:08] you get a background
[37:10] everybody there and terror took
[37:13] abram his son
[37:16] and lot the son of heron
[37:20] his son son in other words lot to
[37:23] abraham
[37:24] was a nephew anybody clear
[37:27] and sarai his daughter-in-law
[37:31] his son abraham's wife and they went
[37:34] forth with them
[37:36] from er of the cardins to go
[37:39] into the land of canaan and they came to
[37:42] heron
[37:43] and do out there you might be seated so
[37:46] right here
[37:49] we can see that abraham left
[37:53] the city of ur of the counties
[37:58] because the assyrian are the caldins
[38:03] everybody clear the assyrian or the
[38:06] counties
[38:08] cardins you're gonna see that so abraham
[38:11] was living in mesopotamia
[38:16] where did you get that in the land of
[38:19] earth
[38:20] of the caldens everybody clear
[38:23] so the lord told abraham to leave and to
[38:26] go to the land of canaan
[38:29] anybody clear so when he left
[38:34] if you look on chapter 11 it looks like
[38:36] they all migrate
[38:38] together but that was not according to
[38:41] the instruction of god
[38:44] because when they left abraham left with
[38:46] his father
[38:47] and with lot so in if you look at
[38:50] chapter
[38:51] 11 it seems like they all journey
[38:54] together
[38:55] but that's not really the case the truth
[38:58] lays in chapter 12. if you dare you can
[39:01] say amen
[39:02] chapter 12 verse 1 now the lord had
[39:06] said if you notice the bible didn't say
[39:09] the lord says
[39:11] it is in the past tense he just dropped
[39:14] right now
[39:15] amen in other words the lord already
[39:18] told abraham
[39:20] so you need to take genesis chapter 12
[39:23] and pull it back
[39:24] up in chapter 11.
[39:27] you see now if you follow that sequence
[39:30] like that you're going to miss it
[39:32] the bible didn't say the lord said to
[39:34] abraham the lord
[39:35] had said it's in the past the lord had
[39:38] said to abraham
[39:40] get out of your country in other words
[39:44] god wanted abraham to be separated
[39:47] from his country everybody clear
[39:50] and we already preached to you that
[39:52] every country have a spirit do you
[39:56] remember that
[39:57] which is an angel that is called the
[39:59] press
[40:00] the priest of that country from the
[40:03] realm of the principalities
[40:05] in other words god wanted abraham to
[40:07] detach
[40:08] himself from the influence of his own
[40:12] country or the prince of that country
[40:15] that is now in between the line anybody
[40:18] clear
[40:19] get out of your country come on
[40:23] and from your water how can you separate
[40:26] a man from his kindred
[40:29] is god a bad man
[40:32] separate yourself from your kindred
[40:36] what do you want me to do i thought we
[40:38] need to keep relationship
[40:41] you remember on sunday i thought we need
[40:43] to we can separate and be friend
[40:48] you remember sunday okay get out from
[40:51] your
[40:52] kindred and the lord drop again down
[40:56] he came from the country then drop down
[40:58] to
[40:59] it's like a whanau kindred now it's
[41:02] going down
[41:02] to the a very pivotal point now
[41:06] amen and from that when from your
[41:09] father's house how can you separate
[41:13] yourself
[41:14] from your brothers
[41:17] you see now not only
[41:21] the country but the kindred not only the
[41:24] kingdom
[41:25] but even in your family separate
[41:28] brother stephen
[41:32] amen to a land
[41:36] that i will show you and i will make you
[41:40] a great nation
[41:41] and i will bless you and make your name
[41:45] great not where you are all of these
[41:47] promises will happen
[41:49] in the land of canaan it's a package
[41:52] that belongs to canaan
[41:53] that package unfolds only when you obey
[41:56] god and get into canaan
[41:58] anybody clear and you shall be
[42:02] a blessing not only am i gonna bless you
[42:04] but you yourself become a blessing
[42:07] hallelujah and i will bless them
[42:10] god bless you look at that covenant do
[42:13] you want to stay in your family again
[42:17] brother random say i realized i was not
[42:19] the child of eli branham
[42:23] and chosen
[42:26] amen and i will bless them god bless you
[42:30] and curse him that curses you and in you
[42:34] shall all the families of the earth be
[42:37] blessed
[42:38] so abraham departed as the lord has what
[42:41] spoken to him so that departure came
[42:44] by the leadership of god and a lot
[42:48] a nephew remember this is just
[42:51] dropping fresh from heaven
[42:55] lord was a nephew
[42:59] remember this if the lord gave me grace
[43:02] to hit
[43:02] the nephew in the family and lord
[43:07] the nephew went with him and abraham was
[43:11] and five years old when he departed out
[43:14] of what
[43:15] hearing so the lord told him to leave
[43:18] the chardin
[43:19] all the way to the land of canaan if you
[43:21] look it seems like they already did it
[43:23] in chapter 11
[43:24] then the lord spoke in chapter 12.
[43:27] that's not the case what happened in
[43:29] chapter 12
[43:30] was the instruction that was supposed to
[43:32] be incorporated
[43:33] in chapter 11. everybody clear so to
[43:37] help you up this is it here
[43:39] act chapter 7 verse 2 and he said
[43:42] man brethren and fathers hearken the god
[43:46] of glory appear unto our father who
[43:49] abraham when he was in water
[43:53] this is where your pastor gathered
[43:55] anybody clear
[43:56] when he was in mesopotamia before he
[44:00] dwelt in water
[44:01] in charon and say unto him get the
[44:05] out of that country and from that
[44:08] kindred
[44:09] and come into the land which i shall
[44:11] showed you
[44:12] then came he out of the land of water
[44:16] now you remember that instruction
[44:18] happened before he left
[44:20] cardinals this is what make you refocus
[44:23] everything back again
[44:24] amen then came here out of the land of
[44:27] the cardins
[44:29] and dwell in sharon and from dance when
[44:32] his father was dead
[44:33] he removed him into this land wherein
[44:37] ye now dwell in other words then he left
[44:39] thailand and came into the land
[44:41] of canaan everybody clear but what i
[44:44] want to
[44:44] i want you to keep there is a total
[44:48] separation amen
[44:51] because lord speaking with abraham
[44:54] caused trouble
[44:59] exodus chapter 23.
[45:05] i'm not telling you to forget your
[45:07] families
[45:09] because abraham separated from lord
[45:12] when there was argument that rose
[45:16] but the heart of abraham continue
[45:19] to pray for lot you see what i'm saying
[45:23] so even though you got to take a stand
[45:26] for what god is calling you
[45:28] your heart will still remain to
[45:31] plead for the redemption of your loved
[45:34] one
[45:35] but you're not gonna condone with your
[45:37] loved one
[45:38] to find yourself out of the will of god
[45:42] you understand me okay exodus chapter 23
[45:49] verse 31 if you dare you can say amen
[45:53] hallelujah blessed be the name of the
[45:56] lord
[45:58] and i will set your bounds your
[46:00] boundaries
[46:02] from the red sea even to the sea of
[46:04] phillies of the philistine
[46:06] and from the desert to the river and i
[46:09] will deliver the inhabitant of the land
[46:12] into your hand and you shall drive them
[46:15] out before you watch now you shall make
[46:19] no covenant when you go into the
[46:23] promised land
[46:24] kill everything
[46:27] anybody clear make no covenant
[46:32] with them nor with their god
[46:36] they shall not dwell in your land

[46:45] alive

[47:14] surely be a snare
[47:16] to you a trap to you in other words

[55:25] everybody clear now verse 3 and they
[55:29] committed
[55:30] whoredom in egypt we already explained
[55:32] to you
[55:33] they were in egypt and they left egypt
[55:35] and they came to the promised land
[55:37] but something happened in egypt that
[55:39] they got a mark
[55:41] somewhere of unbelief we are in ezekiel
[55:43] 23 verse 3.
[55:45] they commit wardom in egypt they commit
[55:49] warden in the
[55:50] we find on sunday that egypt can be the
[55:52] world
[55:53] or egypt can be a church and god is
[55:56] pulling you out of denomination
[55:58] or some of us god pulled us out of the
[56:00] world
[56:01] everybody clear and they committed well
[56:04] done in their youth
[56:05] this is specifically pointing that age
[56:08] of
[56:08] the teenager there where the breast
[56:12] pressed it's talking about the teenager
[56:14] age and there they bruised the teeth of
[56:17] their virginity on sunday
[56:19] we showed you the importance of
[56:21] virginity everybody clear
[56:23] and the name of them were ahola the
[56:26] elder
[56:27] and a holy by her sister and they were
[56:30] mine god claims them beside despite
[56:32] everything that happened in their life
[56:34] and they're both sons and daughters
[56:37] that's where they named samaria a city a
[56:40] woman
[56:40] is a hola and jerusalem a aholiba
[56:44] verse five and ahola played the harlot
[56:46] when she was mine
[56:49] and she dotted or lasted on her lovers
[56:52] on the assyrian her neighbor
[56:56] ever clear so this woman forgot the
[56:59] weakness that she had
[57:01] the dog that she already opened with a
[57:03] serpent seed
[57:05] and continued to play by mixing herself
[57:08] into a wrong relationship everybody
[57:11] clear
[57:12] drop down to verse 15 so you understand
[57:16] guarded with girdle everybody clear upon
[57:19] their lungs exceeding
[57:21] in thy attire upon their heads all of
[57:24] them priests to look to in other words
[57:27] handsome people
[57:28] after the manner of water the babylonian
[57:32] of water
[57:33] which is the city that god told abraham
[57:36] to depart from them
[57:39] the very foundation of israel started
[57:43] with abraham the faith of abraham
[57:45] and god separated abraham from the land
[57:48] of the cardinals
[57:49] because abraham himself was an idolater
[57:52] over there
[57:53] and when god took him away israel ended
[57:56] up in
[57:57] egypt and god took them out of egypt
[58:00] and they forgot and they forgot the
[58:03] foundation of

[58:41] we wear this coat on sunday brother
[58:43] branham say
[58:44] usually if a man is going to be a
[58:47] believer

[1:01:18] the first thing you know you shall be
[1:01:21] believing
[1:01:22] it's all right to do what so the more
[1:01:26] you associate yourself with an
[1:01:28] environment
[1:01:30] leader by leader the devil will
[1:01:33] call will kill you like a frog
[1:01:37] do you know how they boil a frog they
[1:01:39] turn the temperature

[1:01:44] tendency to adjust himself
[1:01:46] to the temperature until he finds
[1:01:49] himself
[1:01:49] pulled away everybody clear so far
[1:01:53] praise the name of the lord the bible
[1:01:55] says
[1:01:56] in embassy three this is where we stop
[1:01:59] on sunday
[1:02:00] can two walk together except they be
[1:02:03] water
[1:02:05] if you want to work with somebody you
[1:02:08] must find
[1:02:08] a common ground somewhere everybody
[1:02:12] christian with christian i know we try
[1:02:16] to hang out to our relationship
[1:02:18] we tried to hang up with an old friend
[1:02:21] trying to be friend respect one another
[1:02:23] but the bible clearly stated that when
[1:02:26] you
[1:02:26] temper with those doors they have the
[1:02:30] power to pull you away
[1:02:33] hallelujah can two work together
[1:02:36] accept the be what in other words if you
[1:02:39] don't agree in certain principle
[1:02:42] you must separate okay
[1:02:46] no problem proverbs 22 verse 24 and 25
[1:02:51] make no what

[1:02:57] with an angry man and
[1:03:01] with a furious man you shall not work
[1:03:05] if somebody have a bad behavior
[1:03:08] you need to watch whether you're going
[1:03:11] to work together with that person or not
[1:03:14] amen the bible doesn't say you're going
[1:03:17] to convert him
[1:03:22] you over estimate yourself sometime
[1:03:25] and you don't understand the devil to
[1:03:28] overcome
[1:03:29] you must understand the devil in his
[1:03:31] taxi
[1:03:32] if you want to beat the devil down pull
[1:03:35] the devil
[1:03:36] into your ground when the devil gets
[1:03:40] into your ground
[1:03:41] that's it if he pull you in his ground
[1:03:45] then it's a different story every time i
[1:03:48] speak to somebody who's not a message
[1:03:50] believer
[1:03:51] what i usually do is bring them to the
[1:03:54] bible
[1:03:55] when they say something i say no let's
[1:03:57] go to the bible
[1:03:58] if you can show me this in the bible
[1:04:01] then we can talk
[1:04:02] i don't want you to talk about your
[1:04:04] bishop or your pastor
[1:04:06] i just want you to show me the bible
[1:04:08] because i know very clear
[1:04:10] that if they put their feet in the bible
[1:04:13] the message of the hour have made the
[1:04:16] bible a new book
[1:04:18] the bible is our land because the
[1:04:21] message opened the bible
[1:04:23] once you put your feet on the bible then
[1:04:25] you are doomed
[1:04:26] because the bible is my territory i am
[1:04:29] not the author of the book
[1:04:32] and i know how to handle you
[1:04:37] hallelujah but don't argue with
[1:04:39] reasoning that's not your ground
[1:04:43] hallelujah make
[1:04:46] no friendship with an angry man and with
[1:04:49] a furious man
[1:04:50] that shall not what lest you do what
[1:04:55] how are you gonna learn it's not that
[1:04:57] that man will sit down with you
[1:04:59] and say sit down today lesson number one
[1:05:03] how to be angry tomorrow lesson number
[1:05:06] three
[1:05:06] how to get really mad that's not the way
[1:05:09] it works
[1:05:10] everybody here by just you being in that
[1:05:13] environment
[1:05:14] you are automatically receiving the
[1:05:17] influence
[1:05:18] of that anointing and before yourself
[1:05:22] before you before you know it you're
[1:05:23] going to find yourself getting angry at
[1:05:25] home
[1:05:28] let that learn his way and get a snail
[1:05:32] to your water
[1:05:33] so not only is he a problem to your own
[1:05:36] life
[1:05:37] but it's a problem to your own soul
[1:05:40] you are putting your salvation in
[1:05:43] trouble
[1:05:44] because of your friendship you are
[1:05:47] giving more value to your friendship
[1:05:51] above your standard with christ
[1:05:54] that's why you see people taking certain
[1:05:57] decision in life because of their
[1:05:59] friendship
[1:06:00] they rather keep the friendship and then
[1:06:03] lower
[1:06:04] the standard with god there is no
[1:06:07] an unbeliever don't compromise with you
[1:06:11] anybody clear they don't come from us to
[1:06:14] keep you
[1:06:16] everybody clear you are the one that's
[1:06:18] gonna make some effort
[1:06:20] when they are around you you're gonna
[1:06:23] find a different
[1:06:24] talk to talk with them so that they are
[1:06:27] not
[1:06:28] uncomfortable you are doing that to
[1:06:31] preserve them but when they want to
[1:06:33] smoke
[1:06:34] even in your presence they're going to
[1:06:37] pull the cigarette
[1:06:38] and put the cigarette in the mouth and
[1:06:40] light it up
[1:06:41] and sometimes they can turn against you
[1:06:43] and go
[1:06:49] ever clear hallelujah
[1:06:52] first corinthians chapter six
[1:06:55] hebrew second corinthians chapter six

[1:07:02] who

[1:07:35] fellowship between an unrighteous man
[1:07:39] and a righteous man
[1:07:43] this road is tough buddy and what god
[1:07:47] what communion has light with what
[1:07:56] let me leave this because he just
[1:07:57] reminded me
[1:07:59] keep ezekiel 23 go to genesis chapter
[1:08:03] one
[1:08:07] he just reminded me and look at this
[1:08:12] stay alert because this is the tree
[1:08:14] heaven
[1:08:17] he just said it so i'm going to go
[1:08:18] through it
[1:08:21] everybody clear go to verse six
[1:08:25] and god say let there be film a man
[1:08:29] in the midst of water follow me very
[1:08:32] careful
[1:08:34] when the world was created we know the
[1:08:37] world was like this
[1:08:40] then the world was void without form
[1:08:43] darkness upon the face of the deep and
[1:08:45] the world was filled with water
[1:08:49] i already explained the mystery how we
[1:08:51] got to the water
[1:08:53] when the the first thing that was
[1:08:55] created was the sun
[1:08:57] and then out of the sun came a kink in
[1:09:01] in other words a portion was
[1:09:04] broken from the sun and begin to run
[1:09:06] away from the sun
[1:09:08] anybody following me as that portion
[1:09:11] begin to run away from the sun
[1:09:13] the temperature begin to cool off
[1:09:16] anybody following me
[1:09:18] when the temperature begin to cool off
[1:09:21] if you ever wore glasses like me
[1:09:24] if they put the air conditioning here
[1:09:27] and you go
[1:09:28] outside and it's 80 degrees what
[1:09:29] happened to your glasses
[1:09:31] the fog that fog is water anybody
[1:09:35] following me so the changing of
[1:09:37] temperature from the sun
[1:09:39] automatically away from the sun created
[1:09:42] moisture
[1:09:44] as it created moisture that moisture
[1:09:47] began to get in the cool zone
[1:09:49] then it became ice that's why brother
[1:09:52] branham said
[1:09:53] the world was a ball of ice you won't
[1:09:56] forget you understand me
[1:09:57] then brother branham said the pillar of
[1:09:59] fire went
[1:10:01] and pick up the earth and begin to push
[1:10:03] it back again toward the sun
[1:10:06] and as they move it toward the sun the
[1:10:08] eyes begin to melt
[1:10:10] and that's what filled the earth with
[1:10:12] water that one
[1:10:14] you need malachi 4. anybody clear
[1:10:17] so when they created the earth when
[1:10:19] everything happened
[1:10:21] the earth was filled with water
[1:10:23] everybody killed you now
[1:10:25] go back to verse 6. and god say
[1:10:28] let there be a firmament in the midst of
[1:10:31] water
[1:10:32] so in this water here god wanted to put
[1:10:36] a firm
[1:10:37] man on a heaven for those who remember
[1:10:40] when i was ministering
[1:10:41] you can remember this god wanted to
[1:10:44] divide the what
[1:10:45] the water he want to put a heaven
[1:10:48] between the water
[1:10:49] anybody following me thank you
[1:10:53] and let it divide the water from the
[1:10:57] water
[1:10:59] you are dividing water from the water
[1:11:01] how can you divide water from the water
[1:11:05] how god took this water
[1:11:10] and changed the earth into this
[1:11:12] situation
[1:11:13] he put the firmament which is the heaven
[1:11:16] that you see there
[1:11:18] and then on top of it water
[1:11:21] and below it water you following me god
[1:11:26] divided water from water
[1:11:30] hallelujah job two verse seven
[1:11:33] and god made the firmament and divided
[1:11:36] the waters which were
[1:11:38] under the water so here under you have
[1:11:42] water
[1:11:43] you follow me now then above also you
[1:11:45] have
[1:11:47] water that is under the firmament
[1:11:51] from the water which is what above
[1:11:54] the filament and it was so so now the
[1:11:57] water that used to be one part
[1:11:59] became split into two parts anybody
[1:12:02] clear
[1:12:03] verse eight and god called the firmament
[1:12:06] water
[1:12:09] and the evening and the morning were the
[1:12:11] second day
[1:12:12] watch now and god say
[1:12:15] let the water wear under the heaven
[1:12:19] be gathered together into what
[1:12:22] one place and let the dry land appear
[1:12:26] so god took this water here
[1:12:29] everybody following me your female man
[1:12:32] is still here
[1:12:33] water on top of it god took this water
[1:12:36] here
[1:12:36] and put everything in one side
[1:12:41] everybody here and this one become the
[1:12:43] dry ground
[1:12:49] genesis clear where are you going let
[1:12:52] the water under the heaven be gathered
[1:12:54] together
[1:12:55] to one place let the dry land
[1:12:58] appear and it was so watch verse 10 now
[1:13:02] you ready now and god called the joy
[1:13:06] land what
[1:13:07] this is what is your earth you see how
[1:13:11] we need to be reprogrammed
[1:13:14] everybody here call earth
[1:13:17] and the gathering together of the water
[1:13:20] called he water
[1:13:21] oh so the water that were left
[1:13:25] under the firmament were called what
[1:13:30] you follow me sees
[1:13:33] and god saw that he was what now it
[1:13:36] seems like
[1:13:37] god is separating water from water
[1:13:40] and he put a limit a boundary
[1:13:44] and the boundary is the filament which
[1:13:46] is the heaven
[1:13:48] and one part of the water is called
[1:13:52] heaven over there and the other part is
[1:13:54] called faith

[1:21:09] people from the people
[1:21:12] the other people will be bound to the
[1:21:14] gravitational force of the earth

[1:24:57] about young
[1:24:58] people having sexual relationship before
[1:25:00] marriage
[1:25:01] we cannot give we it's a conversation

[1:25:29] foolish talking
[1:25:31] no jesting which are not convenient
[1:25:35] but rather giving what we that's what we
[1:25:38] need to hear
[1:25:39] among us
[1:25:42] first of all for this you know that
[1:25:45] no war monger no unclean
[1:25:49] person they are part of the sea remember
[1:25:53] non-clean person no

[1:26:18] with who
[1:26:19] you cannot be partnered with anybody
[1:26:23] that falls under that qualification

[1:26:33] you understand verse eight for you were
[1:26:36] what
[1:26:37] sometimes darkness you were part of the
[1:26:40] world

[1:26:43] redeem you
[1:26:44] you cannot have any more dealings with
[1:26:47] them

[1:26:59] city anybody clear but now
[1:27:03] you enlighten the lord walk as children
[1:27:06] of what
[1:27:07] how can you walk in darkness how can you
[1:27:10] be going around with
[1:27:12] a friend and your friend looks like a
[1:27:14] prostitute and you have a long dress
[1:27:18] and people look at you one light one
[1:27:21] darkness
[1:27:23] so somebody is compromising but
[1:27:26] they are not compromised you are the one
[1:27:30] compromising
[1:27:32] for the fruit of the spirit is enough
[1:27:35] goodness
[1:27:36] and righteousness and truth proving what
[1:27:39] is acceptable to the lord
[1:27:41] everybody clear verse 11 and have
[1:27:44] no water with the unfruitful work of
[1:27:48] water
[1:27:49] no fellowship my friend
[1:27:52] it's better for you to remain alone
[1:27:55] without friends
[1:27:56] than try to find friends and find
[1:27:59] yourself in hell
[1:28:04] what a friend we have in jesus name
[1:28:07] what a friend we have in jesus name
[1:28:10] that's your friend that's the one that
[1:28:12] needs to put a mark in your life
[1:28:15] because you're gonna remember his love
[1:28:17] forever
[1:28:19] there is no height no death no
[1:28:22] principality
[1:28:23] nothing will separate me from the word
[1:28:25] from the love of god
[1:28:26] yes my brother
[1:28:35] praise god amen everybody clear so far
[1:28:38] nothing shall separate me thank you my
[1:28:40] brother from the love of god
[1:28:42] ever here verse 11 and have no
[1:28:45] fellowship
[1:28:45] with the unfruitful work of darkness but
[1:28:48] rather do what
[1:28:50] we prove expose them
[1:28:53] for it is a shame even to speak
[1:28:57] of those things which are done of who
[1:29:00] who are the them the adult nature the
[1:29:03] warmonger
[1:29:04] the world there are certain things that
[1:29:06] happen in this world
[1:29:08] that we cannot even have a word to speak
[1:29:11] between us to describe them
[1:29:14] so how can you have fellowship everybody
[1:29:16] clear
[1:29:18] that are done of them in secret
[1:29:21] everybody clear but all things are
[1:29:23] reproved
[1:29:25] are made manifest by their life for
[1:29:28] whatever does make manifest is the what
[1:29:31] wherefore he says awake you that sleep
[1:29:35] and arouse from among the water you were
[1:29:38] sleeping because you were a child of god
[1:29:41] only christians sleep
[1:29:45] ever clear the other people died
[1:29:48] when jesus was talking about lazarus he
[1:29:51] said lazarus
[1:29:52] sleep those that sleep in christ
[1:29:56] and you that are sleeping awake from
[1:29:59] among them
[1:30:00] move away from the dead people move away
[1:30:03] from those that are under the sea
[1:30:07] everybody clear awake you
[1:30:11] that sleep and arise from the dead and
[1:30:14] christ
[1:30:14] shall do what give you life see then
[1:30:17] that you walk
[1:30:18] through comes perfectly very careful
[1:30:21] not as full but as what everybody clears
[1:30:25] so far
[1:30:26] praise the name of the lord first
[1:30:28] corinthians
[1:30:30] chapter five we were talking about the
[1:30:33] unbeliever
[1:30:34] they are outside there is no part no
[1:30:37] fellowship
[1:30:38] between you and the unbeliever now
[1:30:41] let's go inside the church
[1:30:45] everybody here first corinthians chapter
[1:30:48] five if you want you can open young
[1:30:50] people
[1:30:51] verse nine i wrote up to you
[1:30:54] in an epistle not to do water
[1:30:59] not to company with water you cannot
[1:31:03] have fellowship with anybody that is
[1:31:06] doing this
[1:31:09] this is a problem with young people we
[1:31:12] meet in the restaurant or we just gonna
[1:31:14] have fellowship
[1:31:15] you know that person is running around
[1:31:18] with
[1:31:18] women he become a woman chaser there is
[1:31:22] no way
[1:31:23] you can fellowship together but we've
[1:31:25] seen
[1:31:26] all over the years the young people
[1:31:28] trying to keep up
[1:31:30] we're just fellowshipping with them we
[1:31:32] just keep a fellowship
[1:31:33] we're going to meet ourselves in a
[1:31:34] restaurant and just have some time
[1:31:37] what are you going to have some time
[1:31:40] they don't want you to talk to them
[1:31:41] about what they're doing
[1:31:43] what grant what are you agreeing
[1:31:46] yet not all together with the fornicator
[1:31:50] of
[1:31:50] water paul says what i'm talking about
[1:31:54] fornicator i'm not talking about the
[1:31:57] fornicator of the world
[1:31:59] i am talking about the fornicator in the
[1:32:02] church
[1:32:04] follow me carefully yet
[1:32:08] not all together with the fornicator of
[1:32:11] this world
[1:32:12] or with the coverage or coverages or
[1:32:16] extortioner
[1:32:17] or with idolater for them must he need
[1:32:20] to do what
[1:32:22] in other words you left the world you
[1:32:25] came into christ

[1:32:38] what i'm telling you i'm not pointing
[1:32:40] you
[1:32:40] to people outside because if it's people
[1:32:44] outside
[1:32:44] it means that you left the church and
[1:32:47] you went
[1:32:48] back into the world that's why but i'm
[1:32:51] not talking about those that are outside
[1:32:53] if that's the case you must go into the
[1:32:56] world
[1:32:57] but you are not in the word you are in
[1:32:59] the church but i'm talking to you of
[1:33:01] a people in the church that does it
[1:33:04] watch again verse 11 but now

[1:33:11] water
[1:33:12] company if any man that is called a
[1:33:15] water
[1:33:16] so now this is not the unbeliever in
[1:33:19] second corinthians
[1:33:20] no fellowship with the unbeliever but in
[1:33:23] first corinthians
[1:33:24] i'm not talking about the unbeliever
[1:33:26] because if i talk to you again about the
[1:33:29] unbeliever that means you left
[1:33:31] the church and you went outside i'm
[1:33:33] talking to you about people
[1:33:34] in the church that you call brother
[1:33:38] but they are not living right

[1:34:32] time we're gonna sit in a restaurant
[1:34:34] we're gonna talk
[1:34:34] the bible said do not eat with them
[1:34:40] i'm giving you the scripture a holla
[1:34:43] got in trouble with a neighbor sometimes
[1:34:46] it's not a neighbor far off
[1:34:48] it might be a neighbor riding a church
[1:34:51] and i'm going to show you even a
[1:34:52] neighbor in your in
[1:34:53] your biological family

[1:35:11] influence evil communication
[1:35:13] in other words evil company will
[1:35:16] influence you it will destroy you
[1:35:22] jude 1 22-23 and of some
[1:35:26] have compassion making a difference
[1:35:30] and others safe with what
[1:35:33] in other words when you try to pull him
[1:35:36] you are going like this if you
[1:35:40] not experience yet don't do it
[1:35:43] call a sick call a deacon
[1:35:46] call a minister who's well seasoned
[1:35:49] in the world call a pastor somebody who
[1:35:52] knows
[1:35:53] how to get the fire without getting
[1:35:55] burned
[1:35:58] are we trying to reach out do you have
[1:36:00] what you need to encounter
[1:36:03] do you have the power that you need to
[1:36:06] withstand what you're going to

[1:36:09] if you know that experience leave it
[1:36:11] alone talk to the deacon
[1:36:13] look out for an elder sister that is
[1:36:16] spiritual
[1:36:16] you say sister so and so there is a
[1:36:18] trouble there would you help that sister
[1:36:20] the sister knows
[1:36:22] she's gonna probably say leave it alone
[1:36:24] let's pray first
[1:36:25] but you are quick let's go help him did
[1:36:27] you pray
[1:36:28] but the season sister will say let's
[1:36:30] keep it in prayer first
[1:36:32] because she knows that the power of
[1:36:34] prayer can over can already be breaking
[1:36:36] those
[1:36:37] channels then when they talk they know
[1:36:39] how to restore
[1:36:41] them that are fallen
[1:36:45] and others save with fear pulling them
[1:36:48] out of fire
[1:36:49] heading even the water spotted by what

[1:41:30] to the scripture
[1:41:32] discuss myself and i will go to the
[1:41:35] battle
[1:41:36] but you put on your robes
[1:41:39] so the king of israel did what disguise
[1:41:41] himself
[1:41:42] and they went to the battle now when
[1:41:44] they go to the battle
[1:41:46] who's wearing a crown jehoshaphat
[1:41:51] do you see what is going on so when
[1:41:53] jehoshaphat is coming
[1:41:55] the entire army of the syrian are
[1:41:58] watching jehoshaphat
[1:42:01] let's go to verse 30. now the king of
[1:42:04] syria
[1:42:05] had commanded the captain of the chariot
[1:42:08] that were with him saying
[1:42:09] fetch you not with small or great
[1:42:13] except only with who the king of israel
[1:42:17] they were instruction given in the enemy
[1:42:19] camp
[1:42:20] don't fight nobody you just go straight
[1:42:23] where the king is
[1:42:25] how did ahab know that's the case
[1:42:30] and they put you on the spot to be
[1:42:32] killed
[1:42:33] so if the fight goes wrong they're going
[1:42:36] to kill jehoshaphat
[1:42:38] and ahab escape
[1:42:43] the children of this world are more
[1:42:45] subtle
[1:42:47] than the children of light the children
[1:42:49] of light are naive

[2:06:33] if you're there you can say amen
[2:06:36] everybody there
[2:06:38] verse one and it came to pass after this
[2:06:42] that absalom the son of david had a fair
[2:06:45] sister
[2:06:47] whose name was who temer and
[2:06:50] amon the son of david loved her
[2:06:53] a half brother and a half sister
[2:06:57] different mothers same father
[2:07:01] you follow me and almond was so vexed
[2:07:06] that he felt sick for who his sister
[2:07:09] tama
[2:07:10] for she was a what you remember on
[2:07:13] sunday
[2:07:15] look what he's aiming he was trying to
[2:07:19] destroy that virginity
[2:07:22] watch and ammon thought it hard
[2:07:25] for him to do what anything about it in
[2:07:28] other words there was a protection
[2:07:30] around tamar
[2:07:31] amman look he was looking for a way out
[2:07:34] to
[2:07:34] i mean i mean an open door so he can get
[2:07:37] what he wants
[2:07:38] he could not because the woman was what
[2:07:41] shielded
[2:07:43] let's see how they broke the shield
[2:07:45] let's see how they bypass
[2:07:47] the firewall virus
[2:07:51] but almond hair the water
[2:07:59] almond had a friend whose name was who
[2:08:03] jonathan the son of who
[2:08:06] david who that son
[2:08:10] jonathan to david
[2:08:13] it was who hey what
[2:08:17] lot was a what
[2:08:21] you remember me telling you remember
[2:08:24] nephew
[2:08:25] keep nephew david's all nephew
[2:08:29] this will the devil use
[2:08:34] relax
[2:08:37] but emon a friend who's
[2:08:40] had a friend whose name was jonadab the
[2:08:43] son of shimaya
[2:08:45] david's brother and john adam was a very
[2:08:49] saddle man do you know where that word
[2:08:52] was first
[2:08:53] used in the bible where
[2:08:59] look where the serpent sees enter david
[2:09:02] look where the serpent seed entered
[2:09:04] david
[2:09:07] in the serpent seat brother branham said
[2:09:09] now i went
[2:09:10] and got dictionary today from everywhere
[2:09:14] to look up this word what the word what
[2:09:18] sodomy it means to be what
[2:09:22] to be what to be crafty
[2:09:26] and be in the best interpretation of the
[2:09:30] hebrew
[2:09:31] from maha means having a true knowledge
[2:09:35] of the water
[2:09:37] it's those kids that know more about
[2:09:41] sexual things more than their age
[2:09:47] your friend knows more about women than
[2:09:51] you
[2:09:52] when they talk to you you are blind they
[2:09:55] know the anatomy of women
[2:09:57] they watch pornography they know
[2:10:00] everything

[2:10:03] your mother cannot even talk to you
[2:10:06] that's that friend that was the friend
[2:10:09] of ammon
[2:10:10] in the family
[2:10:13] the serpent that's why the serpent being
[2:10:16] sadder
[2:10:17] could teach eve sex brother branham say
[2:10:20] that
[2:10:23] eve wanted to know more about it and

[2:15:04] and she took flour and kneaded and made
[2:15:06] cake in his side
[2:15:07] and did bake the cake and she took a pen

[2:16:11] right now
[2:16:12] john adab never gave him that sequence
[2:16:16] he only told him how to lie and have
[2:16:18] permission
[2:16:19] the remaining is automatic
[2:16:22] he's already under the anointing they
[2:16:25] don't teach him anymore
[2:16:26] he begins the black dog is wide awake
[2:16:29] and and wedging
[2:16:31] the black dog is saying now next is this
[2:16:33] now next is this now next is this
[2:16:38] and ammon said to them bring me the meat
[2:16:40] into the chamber
[2:16:42] that i may eat off your hand and tema
[2:16:44] took the cake innocent
[2:16:46] which she had made and brought
[2:16:49] them into the chamber to aim on her
[2:16:50] brother and when he had brought them to
[2:16:53] him to eat

[2:19:39] father i just went a little bit over
[2:19:42] the time that i should stop lord father
[2:19:45] not that we want to keep your people
[2:19:46] here
[2:19:47] but lord this stuff are so important
[2:19:50] because the hour that we're living in is
[2:19:53] so deadly
[2:19:54] that the devil is there as a roaring
[2:19:56] lion
[2:19:57] seeking lord father who to devour he
[2:20:00] doesn't show any mercy
[2:20:02] he's not even ashamed anymore he's on
[2:20:05] television he's in politics
[2:20:07] he's in religion he's lord father that
[2:20:10] pale horse that your prophet spoke that
[2:20:12] it's
[2:20:13] demonic political and religious power

[2:20:27] lord
[2:20:28] what we're trying to keep and sometimes
[2:20:31] most of the time
[2:20:32] a spirit of stubbornness goes with this
[2:20:35] because we
[2:20:36] think we can venture ourself with our
[2:20:38] personal fable
[2:20:40] we think that we're strong we can handle
[2:20:42] we can do things
[2:20:43] before you know it we found ourself in a
[2:20:45] wreck we found ourself
[2:20:47] losing we found ourselves in difficult
[2:20:49] situations like jehoshaphat

[2:20:54] where we committed error lord
[2:20:56] father your grace has been there and
[2:20:58] there is no way you can bring a message

[2:21:22] their eyes lord father
[2:21:24] in a supernatural way so that they can
[2:21:27] see the
[2:21:27] hour that we're living in the danger
[2:21:30] that we're in lord
[2:21:31] not lord father to be afraid but to take
[2:21:34] a stand lord
[2:21:35] because if they take a stand for you
[2:21:37] then it's not them fighting the battle
[2:21:39] is going to be you fighting their battle
