give them a clap of hope amen everybody happy this morning praise the lord as they adjusting the projector just a quick announcement how many enjoyed the service on wednesday [Applause] that was a masterpiece if you miss it because it seems like the lord have summarized everything together and put it together for you so if you missed something everything was already gathered lord's willing this coming wednesday we will have brother isaiah chisolm to preach for us he's the lord so that kind of give me a break a little bit and also open the door for the we call it outside they are not outside it's a fellowship between the brothers and between the churches praise the lord so the trustees told me to mention this that we have dedicated everything coming into the path toward the building but if anybody want to do something separate for the building fund because we're still looking for places we're working with real estate back and forth so you can go ahead and talk to the trustees and they should be able to handle it lord's willing throughout the week i'm asked brother david to send the number of your trustees your deacons or ushers and your pastor so everybody have the numbers of the trustees of the ushers and their pastor in case you have a question either you can call them or you can call me or you can call the usher whoever depending on the situation that you're having so i believe everything is all said if you would let's go back to the word of god straight ahead i told the lady at the hotel that am i it is not a guarantee i say i might go 20 or 30 minutes over if i happen to go 20 minute over that's normal if not praise the lord we just want to land down on malachi 4. everybody there so if you're a little bit sleepy ask the lord to wake you up malachi chapter four today we really gonna get there so you need your bible please you need your bible we thank god for the musician they're getting better and better every day praise the lord if you dare you can say amen verse one for behold the day cometh that shall burn as an oven we know it's a day of judgment and all the proud yea and all that do wickedly shall be stubble and the day that cometh shall burn them up say the lord of hosts that it shall leave them neither root nor branch we already explained this you might be seated verse 4 remember you the law of moses if you recall last sunday we showed you that in horeb there were many things that happened but what we point out last sunday was that in horeb a mighty angel came down and he came down with a book in his right hand and that was the book of the law and it was not one angel it was many angels and we found out that that same scene repeated itself in revelation 10. so before they tell you about elijah the holy spirit is telling you remember what happened with moses over there he didn't say remember moses but remember the law the law came with a mighty angel the law came with an angel coming down with a book in his right hand on monsana or among horeb if we call it so god is pointing your attention there like remember what happened there and watch what i'm about to tell you so remember the law of moses my servant not moses by the law which are commanded to him in horeb and we all know that that opened the door that god only speak through a prophet are you there unto him in horeb for all israel with the statute and judgment behold i will send you elijah so there is ascending here and it's very important for you to remember that verb to send because sending all the mystery together when god is sending someone you must know what you're doing behold i will send you elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the lord so before this trouble this big day of judgment elijah the prophet must come but remember what happened in horeb that's exactly what's going to happen with him verse 6 and he shall turn the heart of the father to the children we already explained that he's going to take the fathers the heart of the fathers to all the children and we saw that this was fulfilled under john the baptist we explained this in part three part everybody there and he shall turn the heart of the father to the children we deal with that but now we're gonna deal with this today and the heart of the children to their fathers this one was john the baptist the second one is the children who are the fathers if you notice these fathers is plural it's not one person are you there these children also is plural and if you look carefully you will find out that the problem is on your left side the problem is not on your right side the right side is the correct side whoever is on this side is correct whoever is on this side is the one having trouble this heart have a trouble this heart have departed from the lord so we must take this heart and turn it to this one because this one is the good one everybody there so these children have problems so we gotta take the heart of these children and turn them back to the father are you there so this father are correct and these children are also correct and we know when we study this that this children was not speaking about many children but he was speaking of one child and that child was crushed did christ ever depart from faith no way are you there so that side never departed from faith are you there but this is the part that departed from the faith and the children will leave faith but the father will not leave faith everybody clear the heart of the children to the father lest i come and smite the earth with a curse now if you read this superficially you're not going to understand what is going on if you look at another translation to smite the earth with a curse it means to destroy totally the earth are you there so in other words if elijah does not come everybody clear god is going to destroy the earth [Music] are you there remember last sunday elijah there's two things he's gonna restore first the baptism of the holy spirit the genuine baptism of the holy spirit that's the first thing that he does everybody there and the second things that elijah is going to do is to build to bring the book of redemption down back again to the race of adam adam everybody there the book of redemption so malacca is telling you that if elijah does not come god is going to destroy the earth are you there but we know that the book of redemption was in the hand of the original owner everybody there then in revelation 5 john was weeping because no one was found worthy to take the book and to break the seals in other words if no one break the seals are you there the entire creation is destroyed everybody there so that event was given to john the baptism as a vision but it was not fulfilled yet the fulfillment of that event was connected to the coming of elijah are you there because if no one breaks the seals that means that the entire creation is completely destroyed are you there so when the lambs come to take the book brother brother said that the blast that hit sunset mountain was a signal to him that the seventh seal was broken in heaven so when bro god broke the seven seal a time they hit heaven are you there and that time they came down and blasted sunset mountain are you there that's why brother branham say i went to west for the blast that blast was a signal that the seven seal is broken in other words the book of redemption is open it is coming down so because it is broken there is a kingsman redeemer that picked up the book and now he's sending the book down are you there and because of that god cannot destroy the earth because the entire creation was waiting for the expectation of the sons and daughters of god the creation is groaning together are you there they are groaning because they need the book of redemption back in the hand of man so if elijah doesn't come the earth is going to be destroyed but because elijah cometh god cannot destroy the earth are we there that's why he said lest in other words except if he doesn't come then i'm gonna disturb you so that passage right there was already locked king the seventh seal right here that's why brother branham said the seventh seal is all the way to genesis if you look at the scriptures superficially you're gonna come up with a superficial understanding let's go to mark chapter nine praise the lord mark 9 first one if you dare you can say amen i hope those that are missing are going back and catching up because you might be wondering what we are saying if you miss two three part you're gonna be lost we don't want you to get lost anymore i don't want to meet jesus christ and say you never taught them i'm going to tell them i taught them part 1 part 2 all the way to 19. and it was on youtube and they had a chance to go back and review it so they didn't want to do it it's not my problem it is in your hand yeah being a pastor is not a genius easy job i want to make sure i pass the ball to you when i get there i say they were there the one that have the ball it's not me brother stephen say no the bible say brother branham say mark chapter 9 verse 1 and he said to them verily i say unto you that there be some of them that stand here he's talking to the disciple jesus we shall not test death till they have seen the kingdom of god come with power so there were certain disciples that are not going to die until they have a vision of the kingdom of god coming down and after sixth day jesus takes with him peter and james and john there is a mystery to these three people i'm not going to touch it here and leads them up in the high mountain a part by themselves and he was transfigured before them and his remnant became shining exceeding white as snow so as no fuller on earth can wipe them and there appeared to them elijah with moses and they were talking with jesus in other words in this vision we see that elijah and moses appear we are trying we are dealing with elijah right here now drop down to verse 11. and they ask him the disciple everybody there saying why say the scrub that elijah must first come so they went into the mountain and when they were in the mountains they found out that elijah and moses was there so the scripture hit them back like wait a minute the rubber the scrub were teaching us that elijah must come before the coming of the messiah so now we just saw elijah in the mountain but the scrub told us that elijah must first come but you are the messiah you already come you already came how can elijah come after you you see this bible now a new book are you there in other words you already hear elijah was expected to come before you but how come elijah came after you that was the question because the scrub thought that where did the scrub learn it the only scripture in the old testament speaking about elijah is malachi phone so the keraba were teaching them that before the messiah come elijah will come first but they missed it the disciple of jesus christ missed it are you there and when they saw him on transfiguration they said wait a minute this is backward he was supposed to come first then later on the messiah comes how is he that you came he's coming after let's go to luke chapter one elijah must come first luke chapter 1 verse 13. if you dare you can say amen but the angel said to him fear not to zechariah for your prayer is heard and your wife elizabeth shall bear you a son and you shall call his name john we went through this and you shall have joy and gladness and many shall we jose at his birth for he shall be great in the sight of the lord not in the sight of men and shall drink neither wine nor string strong drink we already explain you this everybody there and he shall be filled with the holy ghost even from his mother's womb right here is speaking about the holy ghost let's drop down and many of the children of israel shall he turn to the lord their god so the ministry of john was to the children of israel specific the children here the father were the children of israel in other words they were the jews everybody clear okay verse 17 and he shall go before him in the spirit and power of they say that john the baptist has the holy ghost are you following me then here they say that he have the spirit and the power of elijah so how many spirits did john have so he have the holy ghost plus the spirit of elijah or the holy ghost was just the spirit of elijah are you there because john said in verse 7 that the holy ghost was not given until jesus was glorified you there okay and he shall go before him in the spirit and power of elijah to turn the heart everybody clear of the father to the children and of the children to their fathers did you see that so when luke read malachi 4 look read the father to the children karma and stop them and left this alone in other words luke was telling you that in malachi 4 the only portion belonging to john the baptist is just this one why can john can look split the scripture [Laughter] to turn the heart of the father to the children and the disobedient those children were disobedient to the wisdom of the just one person not the justin plural one person christ faith are you there to make ready a people prepare for the lord because the lord is coming somebody must prepare the way isaiah 40 and malachi 3 prepare you the way of the lord everybody clear now let's pray heavenly father lord we thank you again for your grace for your love your mercy and for everything you're doing for us father we thank you for the song of zion that has been sung lord into your honor lord father lifting worshiping lord adoring the one who died and rose for us lord we are committing this service again and to the hand the people that are here presently and those on the telephone or online lord father following lord we ask that the holy spirit minister to each one of us this morning lord may you move me completely out of the way lord and may you seal the devil outside of this place may the power of the holy spirit drop down in this place open the chair lord father and may you give a specific revelation to your children lord for the glory of your own name lord we commit and ask everything in the name of jesus christ amen god bless you all we are in part 19. let's see if we're going to finish it if we finish it then we seal it i was about to close it here and it's a way it's a mysterious way the way god is working in this church there was a something that i wanted to leave and a brother sent me that question i was like wait a minute this is not true i told the brother it's the holy spirit telling me go back again and you got to deal with it so we're going to deal with that letter because people are attacking brother brown i'm saying that in revelation 10 7 there is an angel that sounds the trumpet and there is also another angel in revelation 11 that sound the trumpet and they say those trumpets are the same so revelation 10 belong to the jews so we gotta dig deeper and by going that we're gonna see who's that angel that john fell down and was about to worship i'm not gonna i can go with code but i'm gonna show you in the bible are you there now we're on part 19 dealing with blood branham all right when we dealt on part 18 we found out that there were two dispensations right here and every dispensation was a church there was a jewish church that started with moses because what branham said when israel and the bible also say when israel was in egypt they were the people of god when they left egypt they became the church of god so there was a church that started with moses but that end that church at the end of it before the coming of the messiah elijah papa right there and then the second one was the second church which is the gentile church under the dispensation of grace that started also with paul and paul was our modern moses and we prove it to you and if you remember you will find out that moses when god was about to destroy israel moses stood in the gap and he told the lord that before you kill israel i want you to kill me and if you notice paul in the book of the new testament paul also said that i will hardly be a curse and let israel my brethren get in it was the same spirit that was upon moses that was handling paul so when the church started it started with moses which is paul and but at the end we found out that before the coming of the lord again we also deal with elijah the prophet now we found out that moses and paul both warned israel through the elders and we found out that through the elders was a spirit that entered into the church which is the spirit of nicoleton and we proved to you that nicoleten was the grievous wolf of paul and he also was called the white horse rather it was the same spirit and the different name on the different form are you there but before we get deeper into that let's observe or get into the spirit of the nucleated spirit everybody clear now the nicolet and spirit brother branham explained in the pergamos church ages that is started with the name the word elders and we found that when israel entered into the promised land the elders came to samuel and they taught samuel that your children are not behaving correctly so because your children are not behaving correctly we want you to give us a king like other nation and the thing displeased samuel because samuel was the prophet of the hour and god told samuel he said don't worry about it the mystery right here is whenever they reject a prophet that i have vindicated that i have confirmed that i have anointed that i am working with when you reject that prophet they are not rejecting demand prophet but they are rejecting god who send our prophet are you there in uh in john chapter 13 verse 20 the bible says verily verily i say unto you he that receiveth whomsoever i sent i will send you elijah the prophet so when god send a prophet when god sends somebody if you don't receive that person or if you reject that person who are you rejecting whoever whomsoever ascend receiveth me and he that receiveth me receive with him that send me in other words when god send a prophet if you receive that prophet you are actually receiving god luke 10 verse 18 16 he that heareth you here with me so not only do we have to receive the prophet but we must listen to the prophet are you there in deuteronomy 18 18 i will send you a prophet like unto moses you must hear him in my transfiguration the voice say hear ye him so when god send a prophet you must hear that prophet and he that despises you despises me that's why god say when they're rejecting samuel they are not rejecting samuel they are rejecting god because god is the one that sent samuel so you must receive samuel and you must listen to samuel in galatians chapter 4 verse 14 the bible say paul say and my temptation which was in my flesh he despised not nor rejected they didn't look at the weakness of paul are you there to reject paul are you following me but to receive me as a ninja of god even as christ jesus so when you are receiving a prophet you are receiving jesus christ i have not touched the court yet romans 2 16 in the day that god shall judge the secret of men by jesus christ let's stop there take john before we continue the other part go to john chapter 5. people need to be taught people need to be taught we play too much john 5 22 are you there for the father judges no man no one but he has committed all judgment to them so the one who's going to judge you is jesus christ are you there but how is jesus christ going to judge you let's go back to roman when god subjects the secret of men by jesus christ we clear now right according to my gospel so when jesus judges you he's gonna judge you according to the message of your hour are you there those that were under power gonna be judged according to what paul preached those that were under martin gonna be judged according to what martin preached and these on this end time are gonna be judged according to the gospel of the end time which is the message of the hour in the message the rapture brother branham say one day there will come a blast from heaven and the dead in christ shall rise first them old testament sent back yonder who are waiting will blast forth and come out of their first and go into the resurrection so the old testament sin will come out and they will be ahead of us and we're going to be behind following them marching going to heaven everybody here we will get to those rapture down the road we shall drop right in line this is what brother branham said that's why they say he comes with a cloud that cloud is the old testament then you need to understand what clouds mean the bible is all written in symbols are you there going into the sky these old mortal body changed and made like unto his own glorious body what a parade that shall be when he starts heavenward so we are going toward heaven some of this day in the rupturing time that lays ahead oh proudly displaying the blood of jesus christ upon their chest so brother branham said when we will be going to heaven are you there we will have the blood of jesus christ in our chest are you there so before you enter to heaven somebody will be there checking you up if they see the blood they say you go ahead enter but what is the blood are you ready they're displaying the blood of jesus christ upon their chest the message of god in the hour that they live in so when you go to heaven you're gonna be judged according to the gospel of your messenger and you wear the gospel like this so when you enter in heaven they are checking the blood card they check they say malachi [Applause] the message is the are talking there which message is going to take you to heaven you must have your blood tag we want to know where are you coming are you columba are you mountain are you looter are you wesley i am not in this day i am on the mother kind soul and when i go to heaven i wear marathon 4 when they check me out they say go ahead and get in the message of the hour hallelujah he said talking talking talking you don't understand what the talking is you must go with your message that's why brother branham said are you gonna be judging they say yes he said i preach like paul are you there if those of paul entered mine also you want to go to the rapture you need the ticket it is in the message of the hour because the message when brother branham was there they said that when jesus will come jesus will judge you first but the mysteries you have been already approved are you there and if jesus is going to judge you according to the gospel of your hour when jesus see malachi 4 already approved past this way already approved patch this way already approved patch this way you need a message that is confirmed and approved are you there they don't need you don't need to remove your shoe you don't need to remove your belt when you get there when you say malachi 4 they say the angel just got this hallelujah praise the lord displaying the blood of jesus upon their shares the message of god in the hour that they're living hallelujah well now this spirit of the nicolaitan brother branham said on the first season in the early church ages we shall gather after a while a doctrine then it becomes a saying first so this spirit started as a saying then after saying it turned into a doctrine after doctrine it became a statute after statute it became a church and took that church through the dark ages in other words this spirit immorphy this spirit progresses and as he progressed he get more solid and change forms are we following me are you following me praise the lord brother madam said this the first thing he is he's an antichrist spirit john said so little children the spirit of the antichrist already working in the children of disobedience see that thing had begun to start just the spirit then he became kind of a saying in the next churches and the next church is it was a doctrine and the next church said that she was crowned so it was incarnated into a person are you there so when moses started in the desert we found a rebellion open up of korra deaton and abram that was the beginning of the nicolette and spirit are you there praise the lord what did cora look at quora in the days when god sent moses sent sent sent moses with the message and quran death and thought come up to moses and say now wait just a minute you take too much on yourself in other words when god send moses with a message moses always come and say the lord god spoke before you leave israel all of you behind me if you don't do what i tell you the defensive will kill you it looks like moses elevate himself above everybody it looked like moses only put himself on the picture and removed everybody else and when core are in debt and look they say wait a minute moses you make yourself like you are higher than all the preachers the rebellion of quran dayton and abraham is a rebellion against the messenger of god thinking that the messenger of god makes himself above everybody you think you are the only people on the beach the duck in the pablo you are the only one i let you know there is other people are holy too brother brother is just as much as a preacher or anybody else preaching no brother branham is not like any other preacher moses is a leaver do you know that and they were leaving working in the temple but moses was above delivered are you there but korra came he said moses you taking too much on yourself everybody must listen to your tips everybody must listen to your books they must read them the people who are not following you won't die no moses you are not the only one somehow the preacher are just like you moses didn't say they was not holy he never said they were not good preachers he said billy graham have the holy ghost he said oral robber have the holy ghost he remember hey allen but he had the commission he had to carry out and they only as a group and was against moses job down here as fundamental as he was they failed to recognize the message so the spirit of quran the rebellions of korah dayton and abiram is a rebellion against the messenger of the hour and their claim is you are elevating one man above everybody else while he is just like any other man we clear let's go ahead and quora that mean we will have the word once again as he was perfectly given and perfectly understood in the days of paul i will tell you who will have it it will be a prophet as totally vindicated or even more thoroughly vindicated than was any prophet in all ages from enoch to this day that's why when miriam and aaron begin to gossip about moses god said come here god said you know i had many prophets he said abraham was a prophet he said noah was a prophet he said i have many prophets but moses is different when i talk to those prophets i usually fail myself are you there but when i talk to moses if i'm if i am in the pillar of fire i usually get out to the pillar of fire and me and moses stuck face to face are you there so moses is not like everybody because this man who have necessity have the capstone prophetic ministry we're moving all right see hoarding sensors this is core and data fire burning sweet smelling silver before god and those hand-holding that yet perish with the censor in the hand ministers anointed men they can preach the word fine but yet they died why because they were trying to do something in sincerity yet against the word of god trying to make an organization say you take too much upon yourself who are you to say that you get all the word off amen so cora say who are you to tell us that in this entire generation here you are the only one that have the entire word of god who are you who are you so korra could not stand god working with one man and that one man have the monopoly of the entire world they fell to see that moses was the messenger of that hour see he said that saved the lord there was nobody on earth like him he had the message and the people failed to cease and moses was exactly with that safety lord so when that rebellion finished god opened the earth and killed those people you thought it was done that rebellion immortal into something else because spirit don't die when he morphs into something else he produce bellum okay what is wrong with berlin why do you say that the nicolaitan becomes balanced and god said the deed of the nicolette which was in the ephesians over in the little church of pergamos became her doctrine remember right here are you there and said he was adoption off so balaam was the rebellion of korah in murphy and balaam was the one who taught israel to go over there and commit formidation or the committed fornication with moab which was a lukewarm church member cora is against the messenger are you there belem is against the congregation cora says you are no different than any other preacher then say the congregation of israel is not different than any other congregation that's why you can marry between the moabite and the children of israel the message said no cora said no we have a fanaticism in this message we make ourselves too special god uses baptism god uses methodism god uses pentecostal they are all brothers and sisters you can go ahead and mingle together [Music] are you following now watch this doctrine of berlin believe most carefully notice above all that it is the deliberate maneuver of a corrupt clergy it's the preachers to bind their people to them by leading the people deliberately into the sin of unbelief so when that spirit take the form of belem it will first attack the congregation but it will lead you slowly to disbelieve the message of the hour the nicolet and doctrine was the corruption of the clergy still courageous as they thought political power among themselves while balanis is the subjection of the people to their system of creed and worship in order to hold them how do they hold them now watch this carefully what was what was it that bound the people to a nominal church and thereby destroy them in other words what did belem use to lock israel and destroy him are you there it was the creeds and dogma form into the church tenet it was the doctrine of the roman catholic church watch this they were not given the true food the word so balaam will begin to remove the word slowly from the church are you there when it's a quora it's attacking the messenger when he turned into the form of belem he will begin to remove the message of the hour slowly away from the people leading them to unbelief you were playing tapes they removed the tips we were reading coats they removed the coats it's the second stage are you there now i want you to watch the trickery of the devil moab said or bellick so when berlin work the system of bellum is always connected to belak balaam was the prophet and balaam was the king now why do you say that just be patient with me sent to bellum belk come back up here on this side now and i shall show you watch he show him the outmost part of the people the worst part just the hinder part when balaam stood and he want to curse israel god blocked the curse he want to curse god blocked the curse bellam say you don't understand let me show you a different angle and the angle of bellum is to uh try to intensify the worst part of the camp of israel [Music] what are you trying to say brother branham healed the people no problem brother branham preached no problem brother branham delivered the people no problem bella say don't go there go into the camp you will find out there are people in the message that worship brother branham insist on that weakness you will find people in the message that are ripping women insist in that part amen he didn't show him the overall picture he doesn't show that people in the message are serious people in the message dress well people in the message worship god people in the message are very good people no he will only show you the fault of the people in the message they're like he just show him the bad part of it the worst part the leader camp they're struggling that was come along the poor ship and the goat he just showed him the other most part now set seal think really hard may the holy spirit take this now and place it right in your heart every one of you i wonder if our pastors have not just showed us the worst part i'm reading to you brother branham are you there i would just wonder if we have not why look at their carrying on i know they get off track that's right israel commits error sometimes that's right the mentor this does too if i take you right now and show you what is on youtube in the pentecostal world you won't reject the bible they have pastor working on people no problem they have preached molesting kids here no problem but when they get to the message they find out that it's perfect they begin to look they little tiny fault the methodist does too the free method is they say look at that bunch of rolly rolling pilgrim of loneliness that's the same thing you nazaring the same thing you are called holy rolling the pentecostal and all the rest of them what are you talking about brother brother now watch bella the king took him back and show him the act much part of israel the hindu part of israel is that true you bubble readers the utmost part the worst part he didn't want him to see this part he showed him the utmost part i wonder a lot of time if people who call us fanatics and out of her head and thinks if they are not just trying to point the worst part there is too many fanaticism in this message they are just trying to point you the worst part you know there was a preacher over there we found him with three women they are just trying to point to the worst part are you there he said i know they say i know holy holy preacher that run away with another menswear and i know a lot of baptists and presbyterians don't the same thing if you are attacking the message because of that you might as well attack everybody else are you there you are but you are big enough to keep it hush so when the priest molested the children the catholics knows how to clean it up we don't know how to clean it up if it's a mess it's a mess but bella could say use that one and weaken the camp of israel by their worst part are you there after that doctrine what does balaam do this second step was the doctrine of balaam described in revelation 2 14 where in berlin thought berlick to stumble the children of israel by a united meeting so first of all berlin will teach you that you are not different than any denomination number two he will insist on the people in your camp that do things that are contrary to the word of god are you there then once he get that succeeded he's going to organize a meeting to crowd everybody what do you organize the meeting vellum there the guests will go two more things contrary to the world it was first of all the meeting to suggest that they all get together and talk things over are you following me in other words we need to call the preachers of the message let's sit and review the message a little bit talk things over eat together and get things ironed up we need to recalibrate some of our teaching are you there after all understanding each other goes a long way once you accomplish that you can go from there the next step you will be worshiping together and of course a little pressure from the host usually makes the guests go a lot further than their intended so he will organize a meeting to review the message of the hour what are you going where are you going when any religious people embrace buff nucleation are you there and balance me are you there and have the political financial and physical power to back it up there is only one direction they can go so brother branham say once you swallow nicole attend nicolette and make a way for berlin are you there once you swallow bellamy your third step is going somewhere remember it's the same spirit in folding everybody clear there is only one direction they go that direction is right in the jezebel are you there jezebel murder delivered let's move on once you leave nicolette he makes a way for bellamy better make a way for jezebel what does jezebel do now woman what did we find that women represent last night the church now we found out here that they were called nicolette everybody see that come on doctrine of berlin second stage everybody there come on and now it becomes everybody following me now they said that this church then was a prophet now remember he changed from disney nicolette now it changed over into her you see a jezebel last night was the doctrine of berlin see the adoption of nicoleton and the doctrine of belem now belem was the one who made boredom with israel and what did the nicolette do made the organization so put them both together and you got her i want the church jezebel are you there revelation 17 the great everybody there she is committing fornication spiritual fornication misinterpreting the world to the people so once you are swallowing this and you swallow this all the medically the clergy begin to misinterpret the world going slowly that will open up the way to the second seal now jezebel can begin to kill the people it's a funeral home you got it now so then jezebel when she got in there she stomped that little high heel shoe she was wearing it so once you enter jezebel you open a door to worthiness into the church make up enter into the church high heel you gather enter into the church and it's death a funeral home open going slowly 60 jezebel hated her pastor we found out that the seven messenger were pastor he will bring the spirit that the clergy begin to hit the messenger of the hour are you there are you there it's now a hatred that a stage of jezebel here it was just an attack here he prepares something once he hits jezebel it is not playing games it is killing the people spiritually destroying them separating brother bonham said death means a total separation he's separating the people from the message without game once nicoletten started he make a way to pelham berlin make a way to jezebel once you see jezebel watch out in the in the horizon elijah is coming i want that to be soaked in are you there jezebel is the one that called for elijah jezebel hated elijah that voice said this is perfect love what a great and everything that you ever love and everything that ever loves you is here with you now jezebel wants you to hate the messenger the voice say love the messenger you shall present us to the lord jesus when he comes as trophy of your brother brother say my people there could not be many problems because there were not many problems born there are millions he said they are your comfort nicolette them below jezebel open the door to elijah keep that in mind in mark 7 7 when jesus christ came remember belem remove the word are you there and we place the word with chris when jesus christ came he said you the pharisee you are taking the word of god away and you are bringing your tradition making the word of god of no effect when that stage hit israel the second time again there was a man called herod are you there a king ahab was a king ahab loved elijah check your scripture it was jezebel that hated elijah herod loved john the baptist he was herodias that hated john the baptist was nicolette belem more than jezebel are you there married to a king look somewhere elijah is always coming are you following me brother branham we he will also hate fancy women elijah did who jezebel is that right john d who herodias both them prophet the spirit the same they hated the denominational word the church world there's something in their spirit cried out against the things jezebel was after elijah's head and was going to cut it off and she also was had john's head cut it off remember spirit don't die the church from our name right here it was elijah right here it was john but john spiritually was called elijah this woman was herodias spiritually she is jezebel this king was herod spiritually he is ahab once neglected moved to berlin and opened the door to jezebel elijah comes once nicolette moved to berlin open the door to jezebel elijah comes because god does not change are we clear what i'm trying for you to remember is once you have the combination of nicolette bellamism jezebel elijah comes your text message take home message what about the seven church ages that was the jews right let's go to us take revelation 2. see why i ask for more minute don't sleep are you there revelation chapter two you there verse one everybody there to the end they love the church of ephesus everybody there watch your bible please verse one to the end they love the faith of the church of what ephesus that's one job to verse six at least the church of ephesus this you have that you hate they did after so when the gentile church started in the very first stage the nicolette and spirit open up so over there on our board we check nicholaten everybody clear with me chapter 2 let's jump to verse 12. to the angel of the church of pergamos that's fine job to verse 14. but i have a few things against you because you have their them that hold the doctrine of who so in the church of the genta belem also open up are we there check mark everybody following me let's go to verse 18. and to the angel of the church of tartarian everybody see that jump to verse 20. not withstanding i have a few things here against you always against you against you nicolette against you the doctrine of belief against you now who i have few things against you because you permit the woman who let's go back here so jezebel checkmark once you have nicolette baron jezebel who do you think must be there are you there that's why elijah must come because nicolet and open to bellam bell them open to jessica you must have an elijah because god does not change everybody clear shake yourself a little bit you ready i'm gonna launch deep now okay now with john the baptist we found out that john was elijah and john turned the heart of the father to their children and we explain to you that that children is not many it was one which is who christ and the fathers we explained to you that he was the children of israel which were the jew but now based on our pattern nicolette berlin jezebel elijah nicolette bellum jezebel elijah nicolette bellum jezebel there must be another elijah but this elijah turned the heart of the children to the father well the stephen is for the jews it's not for the gentiles who are those children who are those fathers who are they you ready now remember this sad is the correct one jesus was faith he was the christ have jesus ever deviated he was perfectly with the word that's why they have to point people to jesus christ now when the church started jesus was the only begotten of the father full of grace when the ephesian church opened brother branham said the anointing of the lion was poor into the uh paul when paul came paul established something take first corinthians chapter one we're trying to find who are their fathers not the first fathers these fathers take first corinthians chapter three if you dare you can say amen everybody there let's go to verse 10 according to the grace of god which was given to me who came with grace jesus gave it to paul are you there as i was master builder i have led the foundation so paul led the foundation remember that word and any and another builder built their own but let every man take heed how he built their own there upon for other foundation can no man laid that then that is led which is jesus christ everybody there so paul here is telling us that what jesus christ had that's what he led the foundation with are you there no problem go to ephesian two we taught you in the zodiac we told you in the pyramid now we are in the written word take ephesians chapter two you might have to review this over if you dare you can say amen verse 19 now therefore you are no more stranger in foreign these are gentiles but fellow citizen with the same and the house of god are you there and now built upon the foundation of thee okay paul laid the foundation of the church everybody's following me paul said that he led the foundation that's paul he led the foundation which is the foundation he said that foundation was crushed clear now paul opened up that the church is laid in the foundation he gave more information about the foundation the foundation of the what apostol and who and prophet paul says that the foundation was first who now paul is saying that it's laid upon the foundation of the earth and was jesus a prophet the lord your god shall send you a prophet like god sir i perceive that you are here was jesus an apostle yes or no somebody doesn't know keep your finger right here keep your finger right there take hebrew 3. we're going to come back again here i don't want you to say brother steven say oh our pastor say take hebrew chapter 3. if you dare you can say amen verse 1 wherefore holy brethren partaker of the heavenly gift considered thee and high priest of our profession who was jesus an apostle everybody clear jesus was both a prophet and the church is laid upon the foundation of the prophet and apostle jesus christ himself being what do you understand now are you there jesus christ himself being the chief cornerstone everybody there in whom all the buildings fitly framed together growing to the holy temple of the lord right check the revelation chapter 21 just bear with me this is important we don't want anybody to move again or have questions revelation 21 the foundation here was by paul was paul a prophet i gave you the scripture yes paul was a prophet was paul an apostle many scripture poor prophet apostle prophet apostle jesus prophet apostle are you there revelation chapter 21 verse 9 and there came to me one of the seven angels we're going to see who los angeles not today which had the seven vows full of the seven last plug and talk with me saying come i will show you the the lamps so they're trying to show the bride the lamb's wife job 2 verse 14. no go to verse 10 and he carried me away in the spirit to a great and high mountain and show me the great how can a bride the wife be a city are you there he said i'm going to show you a bride and a wife when he show us he when he went and pointed to him it was a city a great city paul said john said huh a wife let me see that woman he look a city why was emphasis a city and it was a church right was belgium as a city was mean a city a city on the earth was that in a city on the earth was south is a city on the earth was philadelphia city on the earth was the audience a city but the bride is also a city but not from here from there [Music] are we following are we clear now let's go to verse 14. and the wall of the city this bride have 12 what to have foundation let's go back and the wall of the city have what 12 foundation in them the name of the twelve who so the foundation of the bread and what apostle jesus was an apostle paul was an apostle this bread the foundation is an apostle so these fathers are apostles did jesus leave the faith who led the foundation have paul left the faith take second timothy chapter four it's for the jews it's for the jews it's for the jews second timothy chapter four everybody okay if you tired you let me know second timothy chapter four if you dare you can say amen verse six paul is about to die he said for i am now ready to be offered and the time of my another boy paul is saying that i'm about to die i'm gonna go the time of my departure is head hand i have fought a good fight i have finished mine i have kept thee it follows faith that's why they can turn the children back to the father the father out there apostle that's why brother branham always say growing to the faith of the apostle go into the faith of the apostle hey brother brother i'll never explain you this what i'm trying to say is i'm not greater than brother venom what i'm trying to say is when brother branham says something even his concept is always lined up with the scripture even though he didn't give you the scripture so when they give you a quote you say amen what we have a problem is the explanation of the code if you leave the code alone amen i don't want your explanation just repeat it like he was given [Music] are you there that's why he always said we need to go back to the faith of the apostolic father apostolic apostolic why because the father were there but now who are the children we ready we know in the book of revelation with this picture that jesus christ was found outside the the the church knocking trying to go and jesus before he died he asked a question he said when the son of man shall come shall he find do you see them jesus knew that at the end of the church he's going to be kicked out are you there there won't be any faith so once you reach that stage nicolette bellum jezebel the faith will be completely destroyed and jesus will be outside must come [Applause] are we now are we together now who are these children take roman eight does malachi 4 belong to the jews roman 8 if you dare you can say amen verse 14 for as many as are led by the spirit of god they are there everybody follow me for you have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but you have received the spirit of what is god going to adopt israel israel were god's children you are adopting a child that is not yours are you there at the spirit of adoption whereby we cry our father everybody there verse 16 the spirit itself bear witness with our spirit that we are who are those children children of god and if children then health health of god and jordan with christ everybody clear so far jump to verse 29. whom he did for no he also did predestinated to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many so jesus have brethren i'm not gonna we are joint head i'm not gonna dig that too deep let's go to roman nine the next chapter we're trying to see who is the children but we saw here that the children are led by the spirit of god okay when we say the children of god it's the jews it's the jews now paul is saying something else the children are those that have the holy ghost but let's see clearly i don't want to say brother stephen say roman 9 chapter 6 if you dare you can say amen not as though the word of god has taken non-effect for they are not all which are off paul is saying that not everybody that is a jew is israel what are you talking about for what are you talking about are you there verse seven neither because they are the seed of abraham it's not because they are jew by blood are you there are there are children but in isaac shall your seed be called verse 8 that is then which are children of the flesh these are not the children of god it's not the jews everybody's seen that we're trying to find who's the children so when we talk about children remove them the jews at the beginning of the church ages in ephesus jews who are there remember the church started in jerusalem smyrna jews were there pergamos jews begin to go by the time of tartarian jews finished luther no more jews westland no more jews pentecost no more jews so this is a time where god deals only with gender pure are you understanding now now verse 9 and the eighteen oh my god verse 8 these are not the children of god but the children of the promise are counted by for seed that promise we know it's faith everybody there jump now to verse 24. now you yourself are going to see those children are you there even who us whom he has called not after did you see that again he's removing the jews okay not only the jews only but also over there so the children are who did you see that of the gentile watch verse 25 as he said also in hosea i will call them my people who was the people of god it was the children of israel are you there but god is saying that i will call this one my people israel rejected me they used to be my people but now i'm calling someone else my people do you see that i will condemn my people and help her a woman her beloved which was not remembering the song of solomon there beloved you remember but i'm calling somebody who a shoulder might not a jew are you there who is not beloved and he shall come to pass that in the place where he was saying to them you are not my people because we were gentile they shall be called there who are the children elijah it's going to be who everybody clear you say brother stephen the children are the jews because elijah will preach to 144 000 right take revelation 7. i left this quote but if you need it you let me know everybody there revelation chapter 7 bear with me if you tired you tell me we stop here we continue another time revelation 7 are you there verse 3 saying hurt not the earth neither the sea nor the tree till we have still there till we have still there children of god the jews now are servants that's why jesus said i will not call you servant he was talking to the jews are you there the servant of god in the forehead everybody there verse four and i heard the number of them which were sealed and they were still a hundred and forty four thousand of order of the children of what so the children of israel the hundred and forty four thousand that are gonna be preached by elijah are not children they are servants the bible not code do you see code here where are we going with us now we understand now that the jews to christ but the children the gentiles because they're going to kick jesus outside of the earth the word church god have to send elijah to return their heart back to the heart of the apostle and in revelation in my in malachi 4 when luke looked at that look split this into are you there luke say this is john this one he never say anything because the seventh seal usually is are you there when the devil knew that are you deliberate a liberator will be born in the time of moses do you know what he did he began to kill children he didn't know who moses was if he knew he would go straight ahead and destroy him in the time of jesus christ when he knew that the messiah wanna come he begin to destroy thinking that by destroying by bringing that coronavirus maybe i'm gonna get him are you there but the problem is moses was still in the seventies jesus was still in the seventies the name of the messenger was still under the seventh seal are you there now why did they split it take isaiah 61. bear with me i'm sorry we want to land down this plane isaiah 61 are you there oh praise the lord first one the spirit of the lord is upon me because he has anointed me to preach good tithing to the men he has sent me to bind the brokenhearted to proclaim liberty to the captive and to open the opening of the prison to them that are banned to proclaim the acceptable year of the lord so we see here to proclaim to free this to free this to free this the prophet is anointed he's giving one prophecy are you following me and the day of vengeance of our god to comfort all the moon so isaiah is prophesying that when the messiah come he would do this this jubilee acceptable year heal the brokenhearted and the day of vengeance so all we know is when the messiah comes he will come and do all of this right go to luke chapter four let's see now this prophecy this is a principle you need to learn in the world look for verse 18. jesus got into the temple and he took the scroll and begin to read this scripture okay all right the spirit of the lord is upon me you see what we just read because he has anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor did we hear that he has sent me to heal the brokenhearted did we hear that to preach deliverance to the captives did we hear that and to recover the sight of the blind did we hear that and to set liberty to them that are bruised did we hear that 19 to preach the acceptable year of the lord did we hear that verse 20 look and to preach and the day of vengeance do you see that why did jesus stop in the middle why did luke stop in the middle why didn't jesus continue isaiah didn't preach didn't prophesy and stop no isaiah was prophesying everything boom boom boom boom boom boom jesus was waiting and he stopped why did jesus stop and we know how peculiar that scripture reading because he just took a portion of the first and second verse of isaiah 61 1 i just read to you and two but he went down this far where the spirit of the lord is upon me to bind up the broken rather to give heal to the sick to open the blind eye to preach the acceptable year and then he stopped for the next was to bring judgment that would apply to his second coming note is so one looks up here look what's telling you this part belongs to the first coming this one belong to the second coming all right let's finish now and drop that you ready let's go matthew chapter one chapter 11. i'm sorry let's line down and then sooner we're going to start a new series on the two stave of the ark of the covenant are you there because when they were carrying the ark they were carrying that on this table who are the what are those staves are you ready matthew chapter 11 verse 13 and 14 if you dare for all the prophet and the law prophesies until and if you receive it this is elijah which was for two so in matthew 11 jesus is telling us that john the baptist is who elijah they asked jesus jesus asked a question actually who did you see over there who did you see preaching this one says he said no no that's elijah john was leaving john was talking john was preaching jesus said that is who elijah job to matthew 14. now we are taking you from john the baptist to the end time matthew chapter 14. are you there are you there verse 10 you know the story had the the daughter of herodias dance in the party and everything and then they called and they told her ask everything who you want she went to mama because mama had the spirit of jezebel who was chasing elijah since the old testament he said thou i got elijah he said go cut the elijah head and bring it to me are you there verse 10 and he sent and beheaded who john in the prison and his head was brought in the charger and given to the damsel and she brought it to her mother what i want to show you here in chapter 11 john was living and jesus said that's elijah on chapter 14 john is killed is killed by the spirit of jezebel which is the roman spirit that is in the catholic church kill john the baptist are you clear job to job to matthew 17. if you're there you can say amen verse 11. are you there i want everybody to please to see that please and jesus answered no let's go to verse 10. and his disciple asked him saying why then say the scrub that elijah must come so john the baptist jesus presented him and john was killed some of the disciples of jesus christ missed john but when they are coming from the mon transfiguration when they sin elijah there they say wait a minute we thought elijah will come before you are you there now let's see how jesus answered are you there praise the lord verse 11. and jesus said so and said to them elijah truly future i thought jesus in verse 11 already presented elijah everybody saying in verse 11 jesus told us he was elijah now jesus is saying a judge shall come jesus you just told us he was elijah over there elijah shall come if you notice jesus doesn't say first do you see that the disciples say first because they were referring to jesus but when jesus is replying he said elijah shall come oh john the baptist already came jesus presented him and they also killed john elijah shall come in the future and restore all things okay watch verse 12 but in other words i love you but we are separating something here do you see that but i said to you that elijah is come already do you see jesus said elijah shall future but the one you are asking me is already came i have already presented him you see that elijah has already come and they knew him not but have done to him whatsoever there listen they have killed him right likewise in the same manner shall also the son of man suffer of them so jesus is telling them elijah will come in the future but to answer your question elijah that you are asking me already came and they kill him and the same way they kill him they're going to also kill me you see you're too elijah you see elijah but when elijah comes he's going to restore what take out to chapter three take out the chapter three so next time don't worry about brother branham being malachi 4 anymore check out the chapter three you were waiting for grand finale we are blending in grand finale let's go to chapter three verse 20. are you there and he shall send jesus which was which before was preached to you whom the heaven must receive remember when jesus died and rose again in acts chapter one he went on the mount of olive and jesus was taken up and he went to heaven so now they are explaining here that jesus went to heaven they haven't received jesus christ the heavens are blocking jesus christ until until when you're there you you there verse 21 whom the heaven must receive until the times of the restoration in some other bible they say restitution it's the same way until the restoration of what so jesus went to heaven the heaven jesus want to come back but the heavens are blocking jesus you cannot go you cannot go why you gotta wait till the restoration of offering but elijah must come and restore in other words jesus will not come until the restoration of that's what jesus said when i will come shall i fund you see now you see now what is the restoration of all things whom the heaven must receive until the time of restoration of what which god has spoken by the mouth of his holy since the word so this restoration of all things is not only too poor remember last week it is the entire world the book of redemption says the foundation of the word and when that restoration happened then jesus come but who's gonna bring the restoration it's elijah and that restoration of all things according to his he was spoken by his holy what go to revelation 10 7. they will never show you the scripture they will never show you the scripture are you there 10 7. are you there in the days of the voice of what said the ninja when he shall begin to the mystery of god should be as he has declared to who his servant what you see now elijah must come to restore all things jesus christ will not come until the restoration of all things as was spoken by the prophet and those things that was spoken by the prophet must be revealed under the seventh angel of revelation 10 7 because when he shall begin to stand everything will be finished you see now so john the baptist the father to the children christ but here the children the gentiles to the word apostle and when jesus christ came the first time john was in the water baptizing people and what the pillar of fire came because john had the spirit of elijah to introduce the messiah and one day there was a baptist john the baptist he was first baptist here john the baptist he must begin in the baptist church he must be in the baptist church first because john the baptist brother brother must go to the baptist church it's not my hazard it is john the baptist when he's baptizing and the 17th person the pillar of fire came down [Music] are you there that day about 33 years or 34 standing on the bank of ohio even there at the bridge and about 5 000 people or more gathered on the bank i was just about 20 years old 23 22 or 23 years old my first revival i was baptizing 500 people that afternoon and the deacon head led me out in the water about the 17th person when i was baptized i heard a voice look up and i turned billy's mother we was not even married today just going together here come down circling out of the bright blue sky at two o'clock on june the 15th coming right down out of the sky like that and a voice world down all over the place there and say us as john the baptist was sent to fall first and forth to foreign the first coming of christ you have the message that shall now foreign the second coming of christ photographer taking the picture oh my god john looked up now what was he the prophet and here is the word there comes the word coming right straight to the prophet right to them john said behold the lamb of god that take away the sin of the word there it is that's him jesus never spoke a word walk right out in the water i can sit there standing in the water think of a drama two of the greatest for all that are born of a woman there is nobody like john there but we found out that with brother branham from enoch are you there when jesus christ came when solomon came jesus said god say i'm gonna give you a wisdom like nobody else in the entire before you or after you when jesus christ came jesus defy solomon he said here there is a greater than solomon when brother branham came he said there is a greater than all of them the two greatest that ever struck the earth god the word that his not is the word come to the prophet in this dispensation of grace not the jews now grace even though i thought you catch it are you there in the world the first revelation of the world was in the water now you see where the bread started the evening light in there that the word true word not mixed up with queen but come to the prophet in them what are they are you there that's your elijah are you there that's your elijah he's not a jew he's a gentile there is only one person who could fulfill that only one spirit that ever been on earth that i know it would be the elijah in his time and he was predicted that he would be which is nothing but the spirit of that's why they say john the baptist was filled with the holy ghost and they said he was the spirit of are you there trying to do god's service but elijah of this day is the lord jesus christ are you there because it's the spirit of who jesus christ he is to come according to luke 17 tell the son of man is revealed himself among his people not a

this ship if not we want to go to part 22. so lord's willing we will try to clear this one up the last trump because there are seven angels with seven trumpets but in revelation seven they also say that when he shall begin to stand there is a trumpet there is it the same trumpet oh it's different are you there we're gonna see how the first stage just sound the sound the sound all the way to the seventh and we're gonna see also in the janta if the seventh messenger has trumpet are you there let's pray heavenly father lord we thank you again for your love your grace your mercy and everything you're doing for us father we started this series on the first sunday of this year trying to establish lord the foundation for this church of malachi 4 because that's the message that you sent to us it's a message lord that is precious it's a message that is the token and we will be carrying this message going to heaven lord father as our password to get into heaven lord you did so much for us lord it took a big shaking for you to open and unveil all these things lord father many things has been uh preached and teach through this series but lord what we want is a revelation lord let that the holy spirit take everything that was put as a foundation to this church and quicken that not only for this church even for those that are watching even for those that are watching in order to criticize oh lord to attack us may lord father you be merciful to them to open their eyes to open their understanding so that they must see the arrow to where they are lord and may they can repent and join back and come back in line lord father lord we ask for your mercy for them lord and we are committing everything that was preached for this church unto the hand lord father may the holy spirit

whatever amen amen praise the lord i enjoyed that looking forward to this next series as well um so i was just thinking um of what he was talking about with the nicolaitan spirit and the balaam spirit and the jezebel spirit and all of them coming before elijah and we watched all those different spirits come we watched the the nicolaitan spirit the word nicoladin is to conquer the laity the laity being the church and we watch that spirit come in and uh through brother branham's ministry right when the words started coming forth they loved the healings they loved all of that stuff but when the words started coming forth we watched that spirit the nicolet and spirit come in um and we watched the bailin spirit come in and even in this time we watched this jezebel spirit coming in attacking what the prophet brought us when we watched elijah come bring us the word we watch the jezebel spirit attacking and we know we're at the end we're at the end we know that it's over everything that's been needed to be done has been done and we're just waiting on the lord to take his bride home so we we can say this day this scripture is fulfilled so i'm excited to be there i'm excited um so one
