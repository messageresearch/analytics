[52:18] we thank you in Jesus name we pray amen
[52:21] and amen amen we won't keep you standing
[52:25] then we won't if you turn to Luke
[52:29] Chapter
[52:33] 2 and we'll look
[52:36] around verse
[52:38] 25
[52:45] Hallelujah you have it say
[52:48] amen he says
[52:51] in and behold there was a man in
[52:54] Jerusalem whose name was
[52:57] Simeon and the same man was just and
[53:00] devout waiting for the consolation of
[53:03] Israel and the Holy Ghost was upon him
[53:06] you may be
[53:08] seated he says and it was revealed unto
[53:11] him by the holy ghost that he should not
[53:13] see death he said before he had seen the
[53:17] Lord Christ and he came by the spirit
[53:21] into the temple and when the parents
[53:23] brought in the Child Jesus us to do for
[53:27] him after the custom of the law he says
[53:30] then took he him up in his arms and
[53:33] blessed God and said Lord now let us
[53:37] thou thy servant depart in peace
[53:41] according to Thy word for my eyes have
[53:44] seen thy salvation may the Lord add a
[53:47] blessing to the reading of his word you
[53:49] know we're going to look at a little
[53:51] thought that the prophet of God worked
[53:53] with numerous times uh we going let
[53:57] expectation you know
[54:00] expectations you know when you're
[54:02] dealing with expectation you know that
[54:05] uh you get what you come looking for
[54:07] right I mean that's just the way it is
[54:09] you pull on the word of the lord we
[54:12] drive the devil up out of here we finish
[54:14] him off is that right is that right
[54:17] because somebody coming looking maybe
[54:20] for
[54:21] salvation someone need Deliverance this
[54:23] morning some one need healing this
[54:26] morning if you come expecting that you
[54:29] will receive it is that right this is
[54:31] the only place you can come and you can
[54:34] receive what you come expecting is that
[54:38] right so we know we want to look at here
[54:40] and just read a quote
[54:43] here from the from the message and those
[54:46] that's writing it down you got to pray
[54:47] when we don't have a board
[54:49] here so uh I I'll read it here he
[54:53] says I like to use he said for a context
[54:57] here tonight uh this morning they
[55:00] building excuse me you see something
[55:04] unusual we usually have three classes of
[55:07] people that always attend the service
[55:10] right he says and like it was in the
[55:13] days of our Lord he says and all times
[55:18] there is a
[55:19] unbeliever make believer the believer it
[55:23] just attracts those attention
[55:26] always he said now but
[55:31] expectancy is that's a great thing
[55:34] brother random said that's a great thing
[55:37] you know now now don't let it be so
[55:39] simple and it go over your head when if
[55:42] he say it's something great then that
[55:44] mean whatever you
[55:46] can ask for you can receive is that
[55:51] right because expecting is a what it's a
[55:55] fulfillment of a promise is that right
[55:58] it's something you looking forward for
[56:00] it's something that you wait on but you
[56:03] know expecting but one thing you do know
[56:06] you're going to get it is that right we
[56:09] know that things is based upon naturally
[56:13] the first thing come at people when a
[56:15] situation happen is fear is that right
[56:18] that's the Cardinal mind that's the
[56:20] intellectual mind these things come and
[56:23] they try to attack you is because it's
[56:26] always Waring against the spirit man is
[56:28] that right so we want we want to finish
[56:31] reading this here and then we'll look at
[56:34] some saints one of our our Believers in
[56:37] the scriptures here and you can see it
[56:41] he says now expect it says now but
[56:44] expectancy that's a great thing to
[56:47] expect something you usually get what
[56:50] you
[56:51] expect you see you usually get it he
[56:54] says some he says some people come to
[56:56] the meetings and well I didn't expect to
[57:00] get anything out of it well they won't
[57:03] because those who expect to get
[57:05] something God will give them their
[57:09] expectations if they're doing it
[57:12] reverently and in the fear of God now
[57:15] you have to understand the reason why
[57:18] some of you not getting it is because
[57:20] you're not meeting God's
[57:23] conditions
[57:26] and see once you meet God's conditions
[57:29] it's yours is that right and once it's
[57:31] all it's all yours Saints but you have
[57:34] to meet God's conditions is that right
[57:37] so first of all you can tell if you're
[57:39] meeting God's condition if some of you
[57:42] come late every time the doors is open
[57:45] every time the doors is open you're late
[57:49] you can't convince me you're expecting
[57:52] to get what you're looking for
[57:56] that's it Brother come on the prophet of
[57:58] God said you come early and come
[58:01] reverently you see your War we said last
[58:06] time we were here we were talking about
[58:08] this is the storehouse is that right you
[58:11] are God's Storehouse and which is him so
[58:14] who God so we expecting and we expecting
[58:18] so we know God's going to meet us here
[58:20] is that right we're coming before a
[58:23] great king uh a great God uh a mighty
[58:26] God uh you see so he's the Alpha and
[58:30] Omega is that right the first and the
[58:33] last so when we come we know we going to
[58:36] receive what we come expecting for is
[58:39] that right so we have to make set up on
[58:42] our heart and mind to do what to be here
[58:46] in our positions when we supposed to be
[58:49] here okay you'll find out though to be
[58:53] what you to get what that you expecting
[58:56] you have to stick with the word of God
[58:59] is that right and the word of God came
[59:02] from the mouth of a prophet of God is
[59:05] that right and when he comes and he
[59:07] gives us instructions because we see you
[59:10] know there's no way the enemy should be
[59:12] attacking us like this we're going to
[59:14] show it in there no this is the army of
[59:17] God uh we're the people of God uh is
[59:20] that right we going to teach you God has
[59:22] taught us how to fight these battles is
[59:25] that right the battle is not ours it's
[59:27] the Lords is that right no weapons
[59:30] formed against us shall prosper is that
[59:33] right what you bind on Earth shall be
[59:35] bind in heaven what you loose on Earth
[59:37] shall be loose in heaven is that right
[59:40] he gave us promises many promises so
[59:43] we're expecting for those promises to be
[59:46] fulfilled when the enemy arise is that
[59:49] right that's when now the we supposed to
[59:52] apply what God is teaching teaching us
[59:56] you come
[59:57] reverent you come prayed
[1:00:00] up you got to realize it you're not sit
[1:00:04] under any any type of ministry I'm going
[1:00:07] ask you something did not the scripture
[1:00:09] said that
[1:00:11] Paul set up what his father put him up
[1:00:15] under one of the greatest teachers right
[1:00:18] that's right in the land at the
[1:00:21] time chameleon didn't have what we have
[1:00:26] huh we going to put our God up here for
[1:00:29] now and on that's our
[1:00:31] [Applause]
[1:00:32] God you see so you know when the enemy
[1:00:37] we don't need no
[1:00:39] discrepancy you see we don't need any
[1:00:43] Discord okay because we supposed to be
[1:00:46] what standing and praying for the
[1:00:49] ministry is that right you praying for
[1:00:51] the ministry day and night without
[1:00:54] season is that right every time the head
[1:00:57] comes to you every time the head comes
[1:01:01] to your remembrance every time that
[1:01:03] office come to your remembrance you say
[1:01:06] a prayer right there is that
[1:01:10] right we wrestle not against flesh and
[1:01:13] blood but against principalities and
[1:01:15] powers and wickedness and rulers in high
[1:01:17] places we're talking about expectations
[1:01:21] when you're in your position here and
[1:01:23] you want to get reverence soon as the
[1:01:26] enemy the Holy Spirit showed us
[1:01:27] Wednesday he ministered us Wednesday and
[1:01:30] the pastor and I knew exactly where he
[1:01:33] was going and what the enemy was doing
[1:01:36] God came in here and exposed the enemy
[1:01:39] is that right because we're not talking
[1:01:41] about people we're brothers we're
[1:01:44] sisters we're family we love when you
[1:01:47] hurt I hurt okay when you get blessed I
[1:01:50] Rejoice is that right I thank God for
[1:01:53] you you know what it is for a man to get
[1:01:55] a house for his family I Rejoice with
[1:01:58] that brother he getting a house God got
[1:02:01] him that house he didn't take any Glory
[1:02:03] he gave it to God is that right he gave
[1:02:06] him the praise he gave him the honor but
[1:02:09] God gave it to him at the right time is
[1:02:11] that right God is in control nothing's
[1:02:15] out of control we coming in expectation
[1:02:18] Saints and he said because we represent
[1:02:22] you got the greatest representation on
[1:02:24] Earth you're a
[1:02:26] Christian there's nothing can be greater
[1:02:29] than a Christian Saints is that right
[1:02:31] Christlike let me finish
[1:02:35] reading I don't know which way it might
[1:02:37] go this this when the Lord called me he
[1:02:40] already knew so Lord he just a servant
[1:02:43] you have your way he said look he said
[1:02:47] now and we're at uh
[1:02:50] 3861 in case paragraph 71 he says now
[1:02:54] always to find out something first is to
[1:02:58] find out whether it's God's
[1:03:03] will now this is what the prophet is
[1:03:06] telling us first you got to know if it's
[1:03:08] God's will you see and now he said and
[1:03:14] help me Lord whether it's God's will or
[1:03:16] not and then if it's the will of God
[1:03:21] I'll try to say slow brother Mickey he
[1:03:23] says
[1:03:24] he says and and if it's and if it's the
[1:03:27] will of God then you're objective to it
[1:03:32] okay let's look at Matthew uh let's look
[1:03:35] at Matthew
[1:03:38] 6 Matthew 6 here get a little F first we
[1:03:42] got to know if it's the will of God the
[1:03:46] Holy Spirit has been working with
[1:03:51] prayer and now that prayer
[1:03:55] has been open to us where it's not just
[1:03:58] no longer a simple prayer that's right
[1:04:01] it's not a this we know it's the
[1:04:03] disciples prayers not the Lord's Prayers
[1:04:06] that right John 17 over there is is The
[1:04:09] Lord's Prayer he said look over here he
[1:04:12] says after this man verse n Matthew 6
[1:04:16] and9 after this man remember they asked
[1:04:19] Jesus to teach him to pray and he says
[1:04:22] Our Father which are in heaven he said
[1:04:24] what Hallowed be thy name he said thy
[1:04:28] kingdom come so that thy
[1:04:31] what so that the will can be done so for
[1:04:35] you to know for the will for to be done
[1:04:38] you have to have the baptism of the Holy
[1:04:41] Ghost that lead and guide you in the
[1:04:44] directions and he will let you always
[1:04:47] know that God's will for you is that
[1:04:50] right remember we read Simeon he says
[1:04:53] Simeon was in Anointed with the Holy
[1:04:55] Ghost is that right the spirit of God
[1:04:57] was on Simeon so that's why we say the
[1:05:00] footsteps of the righteous they're
[1:05:02] ordered of who they're ordered of the
[1:05:04] Lord uh so we come in there and and and
[1:05:07] let me keep going here he says now thy
[1:05:11] kingdom come thy will be done in earth
[1:05:15] as it is where at in heaven so we know
[1:05:18] the first thing for you to be able to
[1:05:21] know the will of God I father we worship
[1:05:26] him we praise him and the only way to
[1:05:29] get in touch with him from Earth to
[1:05:32] Heaven it's
[1:05:35] prayer
[1:05:37] amen yeah that's why I didn't get too
[1:05:39] many amens cuz you need to start praying
[1:05:41] more

[1:05:48] minute huh huh building up your Most
[1:05:52] Holy Faith praying in the Holy
[1:05:56] Ghost you see there's no way the enemy
[1:05:59] should be in here like this with this
[1:06:01] kind of sickness okay he should be
[1:06:03] getting up feeling getting to his job
[1:06:06] coming in here laboring in the word of
[1:06:08] God for us because uh we all benefit
[1:06:11] from that
[1:06:16] Ministry so you recognize that we when
[1:06:19] the Lord now is not just telling us he's
[1:06:22] giving us a weapon the prophet of God
[1:06:24] said that's one of the greatest weapons
[1:06:27] you can have is
[1:06:29] prayer and we don't use it as much as we
[1:06:33] should you can use it in the shower you
[1:06:36] can use it in the table you can use it
[1:06:39] in the bedroom you can use it outside uh
[1:06:43] you can use it when you're driving you
[1:06:45] know you got some of them in some of the
[1:06:48] religion telling them just to pray three
[1:06:50] times a day a certain time of the day is
[1:06:53] that right oh look at the grace that we
[1:06:55] got uh 24hour access uh we can pray
[1:07:00] without ceasing is that right we're
[1:07:02] talking about our God our Father Saints
[1:07:05] huh Our Father which are in heaven huh
[1:07:10] let me keep
[1:07:11] going just letting them have his way I
[1:07:14] got no use for the devil okay if
[1:07:16] something pinch you then that mean you
[1:07:18] need to get out of that Cardinal mind
[1:07:20] you see quit your quit your thinking
[1:07:23] like men is that right huh he said now
[1:07:27] look he said look he said now he said
[1:07:30] give us he he said give us this day our
[1:07:33] what Daily Bread so now we realize by
[1:07:38] the teaching of of the Holy Spirit
[1:07:40] through the ministry that's here you
[1:07:43] don't have to worry about your daily
[1:07:45] bread is that right God is obligated to
[1:07:50] give you your daily bread is that
[1:07:52] right well how many of you do you hear a
[1:07:56] bird getting up complaining a bird will
[1:07:59] wake up singing early in the morning
[1:08:02] praising the Lord uh you know why
[1:08:06] because God is obligated to get him that
[1:08:09] worm uh God is obligated to get him that
[1:08:12] bird food uh he know God is obligated to
[1:08:15] take care of him is that right he said
[1:08:18] take no thought what for what you should
[1:08:21] eat or wear or think is that right he
[1:08:24] said is not the body the soul more
[1:08:28] important than the rment and food is
[1:08:31] that right so God's promise he letting
[1:08:33] you know he's going to take care of us
[1:08:36] he has to take care of us he has to keep
[1:08:39] his word is that right so we're talking
[1:08:42] about now
[1:08:44] expectation each time so you know that
[1:08:47] if God said he going to give us our
[1:08:50] daily bread H you should wake up smiling
[1:08:53] everything today because God is
[1:08:55] obligated to gr us our daily
[1:08:59] bread huh
[1:09:03] Hallelujah he said now
[1:09:05] look he said give us this day our daily
[1:09:08] bread and do what forgive our debtors as
[1:09:13] we forgive uh our debtors and let me say
[1:09:16] it again and forgive us our debt as we
[1:09:22] forgive our who
[1:09:24] that us now when you get there one of
[1:09:28] the problems is brother brandom said
[1:09:31] also you got those two elements that
[1:09:33] you're facing always is fear and
[1:09:38] faith now fear the element is accompany
[1:09:41] with doubt is that right it's trying to
[1:09:44] get you to come in in doubt uh but you
[1:09:46] want to look at this he also said faith
[1:09:50] is based upon
[1:09:52] forgiveness what he
[1:09:55] said he's telling you now when you start
[1:10:00] talking about
[1:10:02] forgiveness he's talking about people
[1:10:05] are worrying about people coming to them
[1:10:08] and saying that they sorry and things in
[1:10:11] that nature look at that scripture
[1:10:16] again we go to our
[1:10:19] father first I said forgive me Lord uh
[1:10:24] why because we've already forgive the
[1:10:28] deiters is that right we forgave them
[1:10:32] already we're a different spee we're a
[1:10:35] different seed uh now you're talking
[1:10:38] about forgiveness uh that's why some of
[1:10:41] you can't break through you got things
[1:10:43] in your heart that you got to forgive
[1:10:46] people for and God's going to let you
[1:10:48] break
[1:10:51] through yes sir
[1:10:55] come on Lord you're sitting there and
[1:10:58] when you're down in there and you and
[1:11:00] and you know that perhaps somebody you
[1:11:03] know they did you wrong huh you know
[1:11:07] things that that that happen but we are
[1:11:10] supposed to do a forgive them is that
[1:11:14] right that's a powerful thing in prayer
[1:11:17] is
[1:11:18] forgiveness when God come in there and
[1:11:21] he talk about each and every one of us
[1:11:24] now we going to God when they let's look
[1:11:28] at this scripture first I want you to I
[1:11:31] don't want to rush past this
[1:11:36] point you go over
[1:11:38] here now he says God help me let's look
[1:11:43] over to Luke I think it's Luke
[1:11:46] 11 God help
[1:11:52] me
[1:12:01] he says let's look at it again he said
[1:12:04] and it came to pass let's start at 11 11
[1:12:07] and one chapter 11 verse one it came to
[1:12:11] pass that that he was praying in a
[1:12:13] certain place when he sees one of his
[1:12:16] disciples said unto him Lord teach us to
[1:12:18] pray as John also taught his disciples
[1:12:21] he says and he say unto them when we
[1:12:24] pray say Our Father which are in heaven
[1:12:27] he says Hallowed be thy name he said thy
[1:12:29] what kingdom come he says thy will be
[1:12:33] done as it is in earth as so in Earth
[1:12:37] give us day by day our daily bread now
[1:12:41] the Holy Spirit you know he's been
[1:12:43] working that real strong with us because
[1:12:45] he's bringing us to a point he's
[1:12:48] equipping us from the storehouse because
[1:12:50] we going to need these Goods down the
[1:12:52] road is that right we're going to be
[1:12:55] able you're the one that going to be
[1:12:56] able to stand in the Gap and stand there
[1:12:59] and pray is that right he says now you
[1:13:02] pray without ceasing remember the widow
[1:13:04] woman when she kept aggravating the
[1:13:06] unjust judge what did she do she
[1:13:09] contined to pray she continued to pray
[1:13:11] she continu to press him she continu to
[1:13:13] press him because she knew about what
[1:13:16] the Holy Spirit showed us what the
[1:13:18] mystery of asking is that right if my
[1:13:22] word abiding you and you abide in me
[1:13:25] whatever you ask you you can receive is
[1:13:28] that right we're talking about be
[1:13:31] meeting your expectations you're only
[1:13:34] not getting your expectations because
[1:13:36] there's things in your life that you
[1:13:38] know you're not
[1:13:41] doing huh and it got to start doing it
[1:13:43] this is not 2023 it's 2024 so the holy
[1:13:47] spirit is not sitting still is that
[1:13:50] right we're going to get somewhere in in
[1:13:52] a minute
[1:13:53] he said that now and forgive us our what
[1:13:58] sins for we also what forgive everyone
[1:14:03] that is in
[1:14:08] what forgiveness is a powerful thing yes
[1:14:14] it it's simple we look over thing it's a
[1:14:17] powerful thing because in the Old
[1:14:19] Testament the only one could had the who
[1:14:22] who had the the authority to forgive
[1:14:25] somebody was
[1:14:33] God the Holy Spirit you need to go back
[1:14:35] and say and look at that message making
[1:14:38] the Holy Spirit straight let's get it
[1:14:41] straight I think he titled it the Holy
[1:14:44] Spirit what it really is he said Let's
[1:14:47] Straighten It Out is that right and he
[1:14:49] was showing him in every showed us in
[1:14:51] every age that they saw them different
[1:14:54] Ezekiel saw him the will in the middle
[1:14:56] of the will Daniel saw the light and the
[1:14:58] Lions then is that right and so so we
[1:15:02] have to understand we going to see him
[1:15:04] as the what as the word of God is that
[1:15:07] right the theophany the word bride
[1:15:10] that's how we going to see them so we
[1:15:12] have to understand in this hour here now
[1:15:15] with these little simple messages it
[1:15:18] sound simple but they're powerful
[1:15:20] because you got to understand how they
[1:15:23] looked at Jesus when he started talking
[1:15:25] about
[1:15:26] forgiving look at this here Lord help me
[1:15:30] let me finish reading he says our sins
[1:15:32] for we also forgive everyone that is in
[1:15:35] debt to us and lead us not into
[1:15:39] what but Deliver Us from what so what
[1:15:43] was stopping you from the Temptation was
[1:15:45] your forgiveness right that's the next
[1:15:47] thing is that
[1:15:51] right yes sir
[1:15:54] so you have
[1:15:55] to understand why God is instructing us
[1:15:58] and telling us to do these things is
[1:16:00] that
[1:16:03] right he he say look turn over before I
[1:16:07] go for God help me turn over to uh I
[1:16:11] think it was
[1:16:16] uh Romans I one Romans God help me it
[1:16:21] was uh I'm looking forward the other
[1:16:23] where they asked Jesus to um um uh um
[1:16:27] when the man had the puses and he healed
[1:16:30] them was that Matthew no it was it
[1:16:32] Matthew 11 God help me I think I wrote
[1:16:34] it down
[1:16:36] wrong Hallelujah help me
[1:16:39] Lord here we
[1:16:43] go Lord help me anyway he says when the
[1:16:48] man came to him um I mean when they
[1:16:51] brought him Jesus and they was pressing
[1:16:54] for the word here'll bring it to me and
[1:16:57] they was pressing to the word and when
[1:16:59] they was pressing to hear the word there
[1:17:00] was no way for him to get in they had to
[1:17:02] cut a hole in the roof and lay them down
[1:17:04] that's right that's right and when they
[1:17:07] saw that faith it was their
[1:17:09] faith it was their faith it wasn't the
[1:17:11] one that was laying on the cck faith it
[1:17:14] was their faith it was their faith it
[1:17:17] was their faith it was their faith it's
[1:17:20] your faith that's going to save your
[1:17:22] father it's your faith that's going to
[1:17:24] save your mother it's your faith that's
[1:17:26] going to save your son it's your faith
[1:17:28] that's going to save your daughter it's
[1:17:30] your faith that's going to save your
[1:17:31] child it's going to be your faith is
[1:17:33] that right because you can stand in the
[1:17:36] Gap form because God has given us the
[1:17:39] power of
[1:17:40] forgiveness that's right amen I'mma find
[1:17:43] that
[1:17:45] scripture what do they
[1:17:47] say what did they say to Jesus they
[1:17:50] asked them who did the thank you brother
[1:17:54] let's turn to mark
[1:17:55] 2 I want you to see this
[1:18:03] Hallelujah Mark 2 let me see where we at
[1:18:07] there where the sabath I think it was 23
[1:18:11] I think it might have been was
[1:18:17] it there it is thank you yes sir and
[1:18:21] again he entered into capern
[1:18:23] after some days and it was noise that's
[1:18:26] Mark 2:1 and straightway many were
[1:18:30] gathered togethering so much that there
[1:18:32] was no room to receive them not so much
[1:18:36] uh as about the door and he preached the
[1:18:39] what the word unto them what were they
[1:18:42] pressing for the word they was coming to
[1:18:45] the for the word uh he said now he said
[1:18:48] he said they pressed away in and they
[1:18:51] come to him he said bringing one sick of
[1:18:54] the PES which was born a four he says
[1:18:57] and when and when they could not come
[1:18:59] nigh unto him for the Press they
[1:19:02] uncovered the roof he said see where he
[1:19:05] was and when had broken it up he says
[1:19:08] they let down the bed wherein the sick
[1:19:11] of the py laid he said when Jesus saw
[1:19:14] their faith see their faith you see he
[1:19:18] said unto the sick of the py son thy thy
[1:19:23] sins be what forgiven thee he says but
[1:19:27] there were certain of the scribes their
[1:19:29] reasoning in their hearts is that right
[1:19:32] that's why I said the Holy Spirit
[1:19:33] already know if you a non-believer if
[1:19:36] you're a makeb Believer if you a
[1:19:40] skepticism you are not going to dodge
[1:19:43] the Holy Ghost in This age here you
[1:19:45] might as well forget about it is that
[1:19:47] right that's why the holy spirit says
[1:19:50] the unrighteous cannot sit in the seat
[1:19:52] with the scorners cannot sit in the seat
[1:19:55] with the righteous sooner or later God
[1:19:57] is going to have his
[1:19:59] way let me keep going he says now he in
[1:20:03] verse uh uh seven why doeth this man
[1:20:07] thus speak blasphemian who can give who
[1:20:10] can forgive sins but who now you see the
[1:20:14] authority that God has given us in this
[1:20:17] age you see what he's giving us that's
[1:20:20] why when I say you go back to message
[1:20:23] and he was telling them he drove on
[1:20:25] their body spirit and it drew soul and
[1:20:29] he said down in there he put seed he
[1:20:32] said in the message making what is the
[1:20:35] Holy Ghost making it straight uh and
[1:20:38] then he said down he did what it was God
[1:20:42] out there right and the seed down there
[1:20:44] is the word of God which is God speaking
[1:20:48] to God is that
[1:20:50] right it's God speaking to God so now
[1:20:53] you're origin of God you come from God
[1:20:57] you belong to God you're the same
[1:21:00] species of God you have the same
[1:21:02] Authority as God uh you have to
[1:21:05] understand now what you buying on Earth
[1:21:08] you shall be bind in heaven any sickness
[1:21:11] any kind of diseases you supposed to
[1:21:13] know now how to fight it off is that
[1:21:17] right because when you come in there
[1:21:19] we're still in this flesh uh we still
[1:21:21] going to have things is that right so
[1:21:24] you got to understand in certain ways to
[1:21:26] battle this flesh is that right so God
[1:21:29] is telling you how to meet the
[1:21:31] conditions in there so if you see
[1:21:34] something getting on your flesh you got
[1:21:35] to constantly drink something warm is
[1:21:38] that right keep drinking something warm
[1:21:40] keep drinking something warm normally
[1:21:42] it's tea to keep the bacteria off of
[1:21:44] your mouth and when you get in there I'm
[1:21:46] going tell you about I'm ready to hit
[1:21:47] the dentist office now is that right you
[1:21:50] notice you notice you got to have water
[1:21:53] right you notice they don't give you no
[1:21:55] more mouthwash right I won't say why I
[1:21:58] leave it alone now but but you got to
[1:22:00] take the Water Rinse your mouth and you
[1:22:02] spit it out is that right but you got to
[1:22:04] have a way to know how to fight this old
[1:22:07] flesh is that right because you got body
[1:22:10] you got spirit and you got soul is that
[1:22:13] right the body we know is the five
[1:22:15] elements that allow us to operate here
[1:22:17] on Earth is that right so we know in the
[1:22:20] spiritual realm that's free more will
[1:22:23] everybody's on free more will is that
[1:22:25] right the Lord even Cain even know how
[1:22:28] to get that benefit didn't he because he
[1:22:30] went in ask wasn't he that benefit it
[1:22:33] was under the what the law is that right
[1:22:36] it was too it was too severe for him so
[1:22:39] he knew the law and he asked God is that
[1:22:43] right and God also showed us now we
[1:22:46] going to tell me uh if a de if a demon
[1:22:49] get inside of some pigs uh and they go
[1:22:52] to Jesus and ask Jesus to get him out of
[1:22:55] there and we're the seed of God I don't
[1:22:58] have to take nothing he gave me the
[1:23:00] right to cast it down is that right
[1:23:03] destroy it speak the word huh brother
[1:23:06] gra speak the word and stand on it and
[1:23:08] walk in
[1:23:13] it this is our God you're got a big God

[1:23:24] huh nothing too hard for our God I'm
[1:23:27] claiming nothing I don't have to claim
[1:23:28] it is that right God told me I got right
[1:23:31] to destroy but it all got to be mixed
[1:23:33] with what faith is that right down in
[1:23:37] that seed uh you got that spiritual
[1:23:39] realm is that right
[1:23:42] imagination that's how he in it
[1:23:46] in
[1:23:48] imagination he got Eve through reasoning
[1:23:51] right affection
[1:23:53] is that right oh them old demons love to
[1:23:55] get you out there through through
[1:23:57] deception and affection is that right

[1:30:26] and acceptable and perfect
[1:30:28] what so we're still talking about the
[1:30:32] point that the prophet of God quoted
[1:30:34] first you got to know if it's the will
[1:30:37] of God so you got to understand you
[1:30:42] dressing
[1:30:43] properly you coming early being prayed
[1:30:47] up you praying reading your
[1:30:50] Bible because becoming a holy Child of
[1:30:53] God that's the will of God uh that's
[1:30:57] your reasonable service to God uh that's
[1:31:00] who it is for is that right Our
[1:31:04] Father which are in heaven Hallowed be
[1:31:08] thy name uh thy what kingom so that thy
[1:31:14] will be done so Simeon knew the will of
[1:31:17] God because the Holy Ghost revealed it
[1:31:19] to him the Bible say the Holy Ghost was
[1:31:21] upon him is that right he don't care how
[1:31:24] crazy they thought he was at 80 years
[1:31:26] old saying that he was going to see the
[1:31:28] Christ uh is that
[1:31:32] right perfect will of God let's turn
[1:31:35] back to Matthew 6 we're not forgetting
[1:31:37] we not finished with the forgive uh yet
[1:31:40] huh look what he
[1:31:42] say look how many times Jesus pointed it
[1:31:47] out oh man if this under me man need to
[1:31:50] come around here and apologize to me man
[1:31:51] they know he did that oh man that sister
[1:31:54] get around there get around there this
[1:31:56] mean you know she need to apologize to
[1:31:58] me show me where you said to that
[1:32:03] now you go to the father First Once you
[1:32:06] made right for the father made things
[1:32:08] right with the father you're able to
[1:32:10] stand I know many people went on to be
[1:32:12] with the Lord and they they forgave the
[1:32:14] person that did something to
[1:32:20] them go Hallelujah let me see look what
[1:32:24] he says we in chapter 6 we're back over
[1:32:28] to verse
[1:32:29] 12 he says and give us and forgive us
[1:32:33] our debts as we forgive our debtors lead
[1:32:36] us not into temptation but Deliver Us
[1:32:38] from Evil for thine is the kingdom and
[1:32:41] the power and the glory forever amen
[1:32:44] look what he said in 14 again he said
[1:32:47] amen Pastor he said for if ye forgive
[1:32:50] what men of their
[1:32:52] what your heavenly father will also
[1:32:56] what look at 15 but if you forgive what
[1:33:01] not men he said their trespasses neither
[1:33:05] will your father
[1:33:08] what that's why your prayers ain't being
[1:33:10] answered need to get that thing out of
[1:33:12] your heart man need to get it out of
[1:33:13] your heart this day you will be
[1:33:16] delivered is that
[1:33:19] right this day you will be delivered is
[1:33:22] that right you will get anything that's
[1:33:24] there now we saying father forgive us
[1:33:27] for holding that thing that long father
[1:33:29] I want to move on with you is that right
[1:33:32] now Lord God uh when I could go to the
[1:33:34] father I could go to him with confidence
[1:33:37] now is that right because nothing
[1:33:39] condemn me is that right when you lay
[1:33:41] down there remember the prophet of God
[1:33:43] when he got down in there he was nervous
[1:33:45] he had a lot of pressure on him people
[1:33:47] can be have a lot of pressure that's why
[1:33:49] he said we have to understand people you
[1:33:51] have to forgive them some people in
[1:33:53] certain positions got a lot of pressure
[1:33:54] on them but the prophet had a lot of
[1:33:56] pressure on them at the time especially
[1:33:58] when somebody charging you with 300 and
[1:34:00] some thousand back in that day that's a
[1:34:02] lot of money he says and and then you're
[1:34:05] innocent also that's a rough thing
[1:34:07] that's like being locked up and you're
[1:34:09] innocent so when you get around and then
[1:34:11] he had to do what he had a lot of
[1:34:13] pressure on him is that right and when
[1:34:15] he went there and he told a lie ran
[1:34:17] outside told his wife what did he tell
[1:34:19] his wife he told his wife what that tell
[1:34:21] tell them I ain't here is that right
[1:34:23] tell them I ain't here so when he got
[1:34:25] over there he said oh bill you know you
[1:34:27] should I wasn't here soon as he went to
[1:34:30] pray for that baby is that right huh
[1:34:33] soon as he went to pray for that baby
[1:34:36] and then what then come the devil right
[1:34:38] because the devil got right to is that
[1:34:41] right he got right to come there until
[1:34:43] he had to say Lord forgive me and as
[1:34:46] that man to forgive me and what did the
[1:34:48] lawyer said bill I respect you more than
[1:34:51] I ever did now than I ever did before
[1:34:54] you do things what's right Saints and
[1:34:57] I'm telling you forgiveness is a
[1:34:59] powerful thing uh it's a thing that it's
[1:35:02] a weapon that God has given us to do
[1:35:05] what everybody can't go out and do what
[1:35:08] I do what brother Steve do brother Seth
[1:35:10] or or or brother polycar no you call for
[1:35:13] something different but one thing we can
[1:35:16] do we can get people saved through
[1:35:19] prayer is that right we get them saved
[1:35:22] through prayer you can stand in the gap
[1:35:25] for him is that right so we have to
[1:35:28] understand what the Lord is bringing to
[1:35:30] us in this hour here now we got so much
[1:35:33] Authority that's why the prophet of God
[1:35:36] said all that power that we have in
[1:35:38] prayer that's all this is this is what
[1:35:41] this is prayer is that right knowing the
[1:35:44] will of
[1:35:46] God tell you
[1:35:48] look let's keep going he says but verse
[1:35:52] 15 he says but
[1:35:54] if but if ye forgive not men their
[1:35:57] trespasses neither will your father
[1:35:59] forgive your trespasses verse 16 he said
[1:36:02] more moreover when you fast be not as
[1:36:05] the Hypocrites of a sad countenance let
[1:36:08] me jump a little bit in verse 17 but
[1:36:10] thou when thou fastest anoint thy head
[1:36:13] and was thy face he said now he said
[1:36:16] thou that thou appear not unto men to
[1:36:20] fast but un to thy father which is in
[1:36:24] what secret that's what we were saying
[1:36:26] remember part of the storehouse we were
[1:36:29] talking about the last time we was here
[1:36:31] it was your closet when you praying
[1:36:34] privately you could pray different when
[1:36:36] you privately is that right you could
[1:36:38] call out names uh you can bind those
[1:36:41] demon forces up uh you can sing
[1:36:44] something that your brother or your
[1:36:45] sister is struggling with uh you can
[1:36:48] pray for him you can stand in the Gap
[1:36:50] with them now you got a Clear Channel
[1:36:52] where you could go and stand in the Gat
[1:36:54] with him why is because what because you
[1:36:57] have forgiveness is that right you said
[1:37:00] father forgive you forgave them so we
[1:37:03] have to move on Saints into what God is
[1:37:06] moving us
[1:37:08] into he says now look he says and then
[1:37:11] what God not going to leave you just in
[1:37:14] in the dark he says and thy father which
[1:37:17] seeth in secret shall reward thee what
[1:37:20] that's right right Pastor openly is that
[1:37:23] right he show you he'll testify he'll
[1:37:26] bring a testimony to show that your
[1:37:29] prayers have been answered is that right
[1:37:31] he heard you go back to the I'm going
[1:37:34] back to the quote
[1:37:39] 31861 look goes what he says paragraph
[1:37:42] 71 now always to find out something
[1:37:45] first is to find whether it's the will
[1:37:48] of God or not he says that then then if
[1:37:52] it's the will of
[1:37:53] God then then you're your objective to
[1:37:58] it amen and then your motive in doing
[1:38:03] it it's the will of God and your
[1:38:08] objective is right and your motive is
[1:38:12] right it got to
[1:38:18] happen let us s in
[1:38:21] I'm telling you somebody's getting
[1:38:24] delivered from forgiveness
[1:38:28] today you see it's just that
[1:38:30] simple depend so once now God will show
[1:38:35] you if your motive and if your
[1:38:38] objective is to do the will so God can
[1:38:42] get Glory so God can get the Praises so
[1:38:46] God can get the honor we come to worship
[1:38:50] him to lift him up up he's obligated to
[1:38:53] give it to you is that right you're
[1:38:56] going to get
[1:38:59] it that's right brother always always
[1:39:03] that's why you think the pastor why you
[1:39:05] think so many demon forces is coming out
[1:39:07] you got to be spiritual sometime come on
[1:39:10] we ain't claiming to be no holier than
[1:39:11] now all of us got the holy ghost that
[1:39:13] got the Holy Ghost all of us can discern
[1:39:16] what's right and what's wrong don't let
[1:39:18] nobody fool you you say grieve not the
[1:39:19] holy spirit of God which by you are what
[1:39:22] sealed until the day of your Redemption
[1:39:24] is that right once you now you're a new
[1:39:26] creature in Christ Jesus and all old

[1:39:30] condemnation who those that are in

[1:39:34] but we walk after after the spirit fear
[1:39:36] can't do nothing us because we walk not

[1:46:23] continuously evil in his heart is that
[1:46:27] right you know the prophet of God said
[1:46:29] in one of those quotes he said he said
[1:46:31] the purpose the everything they do is
[1:46:36] evil their purpose what their purpose is

[1:49:45] Christ then then you can get him to see
[1:49:48] into the word because you got to extend
[1:49:50] you give him understanding to born again

[1:50:08] Earth that proves to all of us no matter
[1:50:12] what when God said something I believe
[1:50:14] it it's going to happen I'm expecting
[1:50:17] for it to
[1:50:19] happen because when he said let there be
[1:50:22] light and move the light gross darkness
[1:50:25] that was on the land is that right now
[1:50:28] we got the word we got the answer for
[1:50:30] the devil Isaiah 6 he said Rise and
[1:50:33] Shine for the light has come is that
[1:50:36] right h brother Robert he said why

[1:50:40] darkness the gross darkness is on the
[1:50:45] people making them think wrong is Right

[1:59:12] this for the home church but I love you
[1:59:15] he said now

[1:59:24] Will if it's God's Will and then what's

[2:00:02] selfish you'll never get it
[2:00:09] done I don't care if you move along
[2:00:12] remember the Young Rich ruler uhhuh the
[2:00:16] Young Rich ruler he had religion he
[2:00:19] didn't have salvation we going to get
[2:00:21] back to Simeon but he had religion he
[2:00:24] didn't have salvation that's the problem
[2:00:27] where you're getting all of the demon
[2:00:28] forces be kicking back is because so
[2:00:31] many came up in the
[2:00:33] message huh he came up in the message
[2:00:37] when was a man so now God sent a what a
[2:00:41] word to restore everything back is that
[2:00:45] right he had to do it we was expecting
[2:00:48] Mal i 4 Luke
[2:00:52] 17:30 Revelations
[2:00:54] 10:7 we was expecting the revelation of
[2:00:58] the seven Church ages we were expecting
[2:01:02] the revelation of the Seven Seals uh is
[2:01:05] that right so you have to realize the
[2:01:08] true word of God was expecting them they
[2:01:12] were crying out is that right because
[2:01:15] they knew that down in their soul the
[2:01:18] Bible said Paul only had
[2:01:21] part so it had to be a time when the
[2:01:24] fullness had to come is that right and
[2:01:28] so God has brought us in the
[2:01:30] hour and but he cannot just bring a word
[2:01:34] without the
[2:01:36] witnesses is that right
[2:01:40] ah oh God bless you Sister Roseberry
[2:01:43] brother Michael God bless you he said
[2:01:45] get around there right he said you got
[2:01:47] to you got to realize that he got to
[2:01:51] have a witness is that right on the
[2:01:53] scene here so it has to be someone that
[2:01:57] has to come and now unfold the Seven
[2:02:01] Seals and release those Thunders is that
[2:02:04] right it got to happen because the
[2:02:08] prophet of God said it was supposed to
[2:02:11] because that's the fullness of the
[2:02:12] scriptures is that right let me keep
[2:02:15] going and he also told us I will not
[2:02:18] have you in
[2:02:19] why h brother Mike we got to get a
[2:02:22] rapturing faith of Grace message it had
[2:02:26] to come to get us out of here you see
[2:02:29] what I'm saying so we not that's why
[2:02:31] Paul gave us a little bit of he said oh
[2:02:33] death where is thy sting oh grave where
[2:02:36] is thy Victory glory be to God what
[2:02:39] death only pushed us closer to back to
[2:02:41] our dwelling place is that right we
[2:02:44] don't have no spirit of fear huh God did
[2:02:48] not give us us the spirit of fear but he
[2:02:51] gave us a spirit of Love Peace joy and a
[2:02:55] what and a sound mind is that right
[2:02:57] because we got the mind of Christ is
[2:03:00] that right he says think on these things
[2:03:03] what's pure what's holy what's just
[2:03:06] what's righteous what's honest you think
[2:03:08] on these things is that right
[2:03:11] Hallelujah is that right huh huh you
[2:03:15] hang in there sister Diamond you back
[2:03:17] home lady God bless
[2:03:25] you say
[2:03:27] look he says for now look he said for
[2:03:30] All Flesh is as grass and all glory as
[2:03:33] the flowers and the grass withered in
[2:03:35] the flower thereof and fth away but the
[2:03:38] word of the Lord endureth what forever
[2:03:42] and this is the word which by the gospel
[2:03:44] is preached unto you look what he said
[2:03:47] come me keep going and back to paragraph
[2:03:50] 72 he says it's if it's selfish you'll
[2:03:54] never get it
[2:03:55] done see some of you running around in
[2:03:58] there God always bring warning before
[2:04:00] judgment remember the Holy Spirit send a
[2:04:03] message and he said oh you have a south
[2:04:05] wind is that right it come easy right
[2:04:08] now is that right but things is mounting
[2:04:11] up is that right what they going to do
[2:04:14] what are they doing they getting you to
[2:04:15] going you're going to spend all that
[2:04:17] money you going to get it not they're
[2:04:19] going to force you to spin it if you
[2:04:20] ain't depending on the one who create
[2:04:23] who created everything is that right
[2:04:26] look what he said he created everything
[2:04:29] is that right everything of the seen and
[2:04:31] none of the Unseen what did he say there
[2:04:33] in the gospel of Gospel of John what did
[2:04:36] he tell him there in the beginning was
[2:04:38] the what he said the word and he said
[2:04:41] the word was with God in the beginning
[2:04:43] was the word and the Word was with God
[2:04:46] and the Word was God he said the same
[2:04:49] was in the beginning with God he says
[2:04:51] and all things were made by what him and
[2:04:55] without him was not anything made that
[2:04:58] was what everything was made about him
[2:05:03] is that right huh let's look around and
[2:05:05] see what he say he says now he he says
[2:05:08] all things were made by him and without
[2:05:11] him was not anything made that was made
[2:05:15] he says in him was what life and the
[2:05:18] life was the
[2:05:24] what he's looking for the
[2:05:28] life if you don't have the
[2:05:30] life there's no way the Holy Ghost is
[2:05:41] [Music]
[2:05:43] there he says in him he says all things
[2:05:47] were made by him and without him was not
[2:05:49] anything made that was made in him was
[2:05:52] life and the life was the light of men
[2:05:55] and the light shineth in darkness and
[2:05:57] the Darkness comprehended not he said
[2:06:00] there was a a man that what that sent
[2:06:03] from God whose name was who John did not
[2:06:06] they have such a light that was in uh
[2:06:08] brother Brandon they thought he was the
[2:06:10] one huh he says and that witness was a
[2:06:13] witness to Bear witness of the life he
[2:06:15] said that all men him might believe he
[2:06:18] was not that light but was sent to Bear
[2:06:21] witness of that light he said verse n
[2:06:25] that that was the True Light which lith
[2:06:28] every man that cometh into the world
[2:06:32] that's the True Light what's the pure
[2:06:34] that mean the pure only the pure
[2:06:36] unadulterated word could come back in
[2:06:38] this hour here and now so the light can
[2:06:41] be manifested that it should be
[2:06:43] manifested in there that's why he said
[2:06:46] you have the word it's not just the word
[2:06:48] word the prophet of God said now is the
[2:06:51] hour it's the manifestation of the
[2:06:54] spoken word is that
[2:06:56] right oh man we got so much here I tell
[2:06:59] you he said look at this here we're
[2:07:02] talking about expecting I'll say this
[2:07:05] here and I I I know better come to a
[2:07:07] close blind blind
[2:07:11] barbus remember when he was there and he
[2:07:13] was blind and he was there and he had he
[2:07:16] had a
[2:07:17] lamb and those Lambs he got there and he
[2:07:20] he used to and Dove turtle doves and
[2:07:23] then those turtle doves it's uh they
[2:07:26] would do
[2:07:27] tricks and they would do tricks and then
[2:07:30] he would get a little more money you
[2:07:31] know if he was there doing doing
[2:07:34] tricks and then he got there and I think
[2:07:36] his daughter got sick he was married
[2:07:39] probably God said he was married he had
[2:07:41] a daughter he said he got there and then
[2:07:44] they got there and after you can come on
[2:07:46] up musicians and he got there and he but
[2:07:49] and and and he had a uh his daughter got
[2:07:51] sick then his wife his wife got sick and
[2:07:56] all he had was a goat is that right and
[2:07:59] I mean a lamb that lamb and that lamb
[2:08:01] that he
[2:08:02] had he he he took a vow to sacrifice
[2:08:06] that
[2:08:07] lamb and he took a vow to sacrifice that
[2:08:12] lamb but we know he was
[2:08:15] expecting
[2:08:17] something
[2:08:19] amen but he
[2:08:21] sacrificed everything that he had that
[2:08:23] was dear to him right for someone
[2:08:30] else and when he got there and he said
[2:08:33] the priest said I'll get you that lamb
[2:08:35] I'll get you another lamb he said
[2:08:38] no I promise to give him this
[2:08:42] lamb and when he sacrificed and he gave
[2:08:44] him that
[2:08:46] land he got there and knew
[2:08:49] that the real Lamb of
[2:08:53] God was coming
[2:08:55] by and when the real Lamb of God came
[2:08:59] by he cried
[2:09:02] out he said have mercy upon
[2:09:06] me have mercy upon me
[2:09:10] Lord and he said
[2:09:12] God knew he knew the sacrifices him
[2:09:17] being God knowing all things and I'm
[2:09:20] just paraphrasing it God gave him his
[2:09:24] sight if you expecting
[2:09:27] something is based upon
[2:09:32] conditions I'm not saying what should be
[2:09:36] and shouldn't
[2:09:37] be but I
[2:09:40] know we get that forgiveness and pray
[2:09:43] more CU that's what pricked my heart
[2:09:45] more than
[2:09:47] anything there's no way he should be
[2:09:49] sitting
[2:09:51] there no way all this power we
[2:09:56] got all this standing in the
[2:10:00] Gap all this we should be
[2:10:04] doing we serve a supernatural
[2:10:08] God the things that the the the things
[2:10:12] that the Lord allow him to do they're
[2:10:16] Supernatural it's be done from the inner
[2:10:19] man it's the inner man that carries
[2:10:22] you so we have to understand where are
[2:10:28] family and I didn't even get past I
[2:10:30] didn't have but two two verse I mean two
[2:10:33] paragraphs here but I believe God wanted
[2:10:36] he said what he needed to
[2:10:38] say I know it was like a shotgun get
[2:10:41] around there and but we love the pastor
[2:10:45] he's there to us and you have to
[2:10:48] understand when you get something a
[2:10:50] special gift you
[2:10:52] know we're all all these storehouses
[2:10:56] that's around we got many storehouses
[2:10:59] now God is richly blessing us all God is
[2:11:03] rich in
[2:11:05] Mercy he says but it's no more just

[2:11:12] com into the unity of the
