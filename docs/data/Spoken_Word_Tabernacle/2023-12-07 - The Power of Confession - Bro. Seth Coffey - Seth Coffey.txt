there's a there's a lot of people out there that would love to have the opportunity that you have tonight but God has given you the opportunity to be able to hear his word but not only hear it but be able to believe it tonight what a privilege and honor it is to be here I just want to say that I'm extremely grateful that brother Steven would allow me to come back you know he keeps letting me come back and I say man I I don't know why but he does and I I sure appreciate it I think think very very highly of your pastor he's just a you know I know there's none good but God but he's a good man and I I appreciate him and and all that he does you know he's a he's a walking message encyclopedia if I could call him that but but we we appreciate him and I I I wish that you know I guess it's just something I don't know if y'all were like this but however you are you seem like you wish you could just be somebody else or be like somebody else or have the talents that they have but I wish I could be more like him and but I'm not him I'm brother Seth Coffey so I got to be myself amen so you just be you and I'll be me and we'll Worship the Lord together amen amen if you would uh if you don't mind praying for me I've been a little under the weather but we believe by by his stripes we are healed amen amen if you have your bibles if you don't mind turning to Hebrews the 2 chapter and and I studied just about all day but I still feel like I got a mess in front of me so you just be praying for me we you I tell you it it'll be all right amen amen Hebrews chapter 2 and verse 17 and then uh Hebrews 4 and 15 and Hebrews 3 and one amen and uh I would like to uh if the Lord would be merciful to us tonight I had a little thought come on my mind this evening and I just tried to follow it out by the grace of God and and I would like to speak on the power of our confession confession the power of our confession Amen in Hebrews 2 and 17 it says wherefore in all things it behooved him to be made like unto his Brethren that he might be made a might be a merciful and faithful high priest and things pertaining to God to make reconciliation for the sins of the people in Hebrews 4:5 it says for the word of God is quick and powerful and sharp than any two-edged sword piercing even the dividing suer of the Soul and Spirit and of the joints and Marrow and it is a zerner of the thoughts and the intents of the heart I apologize I had that wrote wrong there but that's you know what I'm talking about amen neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight but all things are naked and open under the eyes of him with whom we have to do seeing that seeing then that we have a great high priest that has passed into the heavens Jesus the son of God let us hold fast our profession for we have not a high priest which cannot be touched with the filling of our infirmities but all but was in all points temp tempted like as we are yet without sin Let Us therefore come boldly amen unto the throne of grace that we may obtain mercy and find Grace to help us in the time of need that's right Amen Let Us bow our heads for a moment Heavenly Father Lord Jesus we come before you Lord and father in my own ability Lord I've already made a mistake Lord and Lord I'll make many more father God but Lord we're not looking to Seth coffee but father we're looking under Jesus tonight Lord father God we know Lord if any good thing happens Lord it'll be because of you tonight father Lord we're just asking you tonight Lord would you come Lord have preeminence in this service Lord take over each and every heart now Lord you see the little thought Lord in the way that I would like it to go father but Lord I want it to go the way you want it to go father Lord you say what you want to say and you do what you want to do father and Lord at the end of the day Lord when the the last amen is said father we'll be sure to give you all the honor and all the glory for everything that's said and done father Lord we thank you Father that that even now Lord we can declare father a successful service father CU Lord At the beginning of this service Lord we confess that you're still God lord at the beginning of this service we confess Lord you said where two or three are gathered in my name there you would be in the midst Lord so father we can say boldly Lord we thank you Lord for being here this evening father we thank you Lord for touching each and every heart tonight Lord you've seen the needs Lord before the foundation of the world Lord and how they would walk into this building father and be answered tonight Lord we thank you for that Lord we give you the glory the honor and the praise for it Lord we thank you Lord that we have a high priest Lord that we can turn to tonight Lord there's many psychiatrists Lord and different things out there that people talk to Lord and we know the prophet said that psychologists have psychologists Lord God they're not an absolute they're not something they're not a fix all Lord but we have a high priest Lord that we can come to Lord when we're overwhelmed Lord God and we don't know where to turn to Father we have one to turn to tonight Lord and that's who we're looking to Lord the man Christ Jesus tonight father Lord I just say this tonight Lord if there be anything in this building Lord that's not pleasing to you you Lord that would hinder your spirit father Lord would you just forgive us Lord if if there's that little thought Lord that that might would come to my mind or somebody in the congregation of I shouldn't have done that or or maybe I should have handled that a different way Lord would you forgive us just now almighty God lord lord we want you to be welcome here Lord we don't want you just to be in the corner with dirty feet almighty God but Lord we want you to come Lord and Lord as brother Brandon would teach us the doors in the heart father we want you to feel welcome any anywhere you want to go tonight Lord whether it be in our personal life Lord or different things Lord our walk with you wherever it needs to be Lord we open those doors up and say Lord you're welcome father Lord I I think of that Lord when you go to a door and you look down and there's a mat there father and on top of it Lord it says welcome almighty God lord I just pray Lord that you would feel so welcome Lord God that the door would be open Lord that you could walk in Lord that you could go down each and aisle of every heart almighty God Lord take every place that you want to anywhere you want to go Lord if we need to have a clean out Lord Clean us out father if we need to have encouragement in our house encourage us tonight Lord whatever it is that we have need of father I think of Romans 8:26 father Lord when it says that we don't even know how to pray Lord the spirit maketh intercession for us almighty God and that's like the high priest you are almighty God make it intercession for us Lord that we might not even know what we need tonight almighty God but you're making intercession for us to give us that which we have need of almighty God bless this service tonight Lord and we'll give you all the honor and glory in Jesus name amen you may be seated the power of confession now in Hebrews 3:1 it says wherefore holy Brethren partakers of the Heavenly calling consider the Apostle and high priest of our profession Christ Jesus now brother brandom says he's the high priest of our what our confession Hebrews 3:1 now he's sitting at the right hand of the father to make intercession Upon Our confession see we've got to believe it accept it and confess it and he's before the father to make good anything my he's before the father to make good anything we confess in the Redemptive blessings of course now Jesus said whatsoever things you desire When you pray believe you receive them and it shall be given to you is that right and very verily I say unto you if you should say this mountain in your heart be plucked up and Cast Away or removed and doubt it not but but now watch but believing that those things which you sh say shall come to pass you'll have it see whatsoever he saith see whatsoever you confess if in your heart tonight if you're dying with heart trouble if you've got cancer if with the appropriated faith if you believe with all your heart and just something is anchored there that says I believe Jesus Christ I believe him with all my heart and I now accept him as my healer and believe that he heals me and from your soul believe that say I am healed he said let him that's weak say I am strong see just say in your heart that I am now strong I have now accepted Jesus as my healer and never have any negative testimony anymore so you can't just Proclaim this and still have the the the negative rotten attitude that you have but you have to have a you can't have that negative testimony anymore you just believe God and God I love this God is under obligation Jesus Christ is sitting at the right right hand of the father to accept you for he's sitting there the high priest of your confession amen see we're not just talking to anybody here but we're talking to the Son of God our high priest for your confession to make good before the father anything that he died for that you're confessing that he's done wow there you are now Divine Healing cannot be any pler than that it's to the weakest you can do it remember God's word will defeat Satan anywhere any place any time under any condition so you can say tonight it doesn't matter how I'm feeling it doesn't matter what I'm going through as long as I still got the word of God I still have victory tonight now listen I've got a few quotes here he said now here's what it is friend see if you get it you're a Christian because you believe that you're a Christian right and it's all settled because he's a high priest now notice he's the high priest of your confession that's right you get what I mean what you confess is what you are that's it what you confess is what you are that's what you are any man will never live any farther or any higher than what he believes he is living now listen I don't know where you're living you know where you living you know where you are with God and your confession is actually where you are with God whatever you confess is where you will be with God amen amen now listen what brother ROM says here he says and when when the inspiration of the holy spirit is here to inspire you remember God will make your body come into your confession now listen he's going to go into the negative side here he said if you say you're a drunkard and want a drink don't worry you'll soon be one that's right if you say you're a sinner and want to sin well you'll be right into it right you see because the power of your confession is going to control what you are you can't help it what you go through life confessing is what you're going to be and I might get a little ahead of myself but I don't know where I'm going anywhere so let's just preach but you see whatever you begin to confess you wake up and and you go through life and you get to work and there's that coworker it's old Negative Nancy and every time you're around them they have nothing good to say and you know what they've got nothing good to produce because they're whole confession is is my life is bad and this is wrong with my life and that's wrong with our and you know what that is what's wrong with their life because that's the power of their confession that's exactly right preach my brother but I want to say by the grace of God yes sir if we can look in the natural of things and we can begin to look at the people around us and and we can begin to look at so-called Negative Nancy and we can see by the power of their confession that they can have a bad day I say how much more tonight by the power of the Holy Ghost can Sons and Daughters of God have a positive confession and Believe on God Almighty that we have an high priest that can be touched by the fing of our infirmities brother says if you say you're a Christian and believe it all along your testimony will bring you right into it if you believe in healing and believe that God has healed you confess it and God will make your body obey your confession that's right for he's the high priest of your confession sitting at the right hand of the father now with his own blood Amen to make intercession for any confession upon anything that he died for and he died to rid sin and sickness in the result of sin he was oh he died to rid sin and sickness in the result of sin and brother brandham says he was wounded for our transgressions with his strapes we are healed remember that have faith don't wav or stand on I think many times the problem with our confession is it's nothing more than a 22nd confession we don't really believe what we're standing on but if we really believe God and have a confession that we're standing on the high priest's words that we're standing that whatever he said must come to pass amen that's when the body will begin to obey the word of God amen amen amen glory to God remember brother Brandon he he in in his earlier life and throughout most of his life he had a an issue of his stomach where he couldn't eat things and and he said as soon as a real genuine Christian faith anchors in a person's heart let them be bound in a wheelchair blind whatever it is they tell it that's right I'm Healed right right not not not before a manifestation but the confession that drops down in the heart of a believer that will begin to confess that I'm Healed yes sir how do you know you are Jesus said so and I believe it there you are yes oh I like to throw that in the devil's face I say not if there's ever a people that should throw something in the devil's face look where God's brought you from look where God brought you out of look how God's took care of you I think there ought to be some people that aren't ashamed to confess almighty God In This Place amen amen yes there you are oh I'd like to throw that in the devil's face when he stood there at mayos the mayos them group of doctors around me Reverend brandom you're finished but he said Jesus said I'll heal you Hallelujah I took him at his word yes he hates me I know he does speaking of devil he said but Christ loves me because he redeemed me all right yes I like to push that back in him every time I get the chance he said you don't feel any better than you ever felt now listen brother brandham said when he was going through this trial and a different quote he said he would confess that he was healed and he would go to eat a meal and he would swallow that meal and they said that'll kill you and he swallowed it anyway and it be to drop down into his stomach and they say how you feel he said I'm feeling great he said I had to swallow it back down but over and over and over he confessed it until the very day that he received his healing to the very day that the body obeyed the word of his confession yes my brother yes sir Hallelujah I took him out his word yes sir when I come out of there I said oh boy if you want to hear me praise God stick around you'll hear me yes sir I'm going to tell you this I think was Apostle Paul said therefore I'll rather glory in my infirmities knowing that the the power of Christ May rest upon me I'll tell you what if there's ever a time you should be thankful when you're going through the trial you should be thankful when you're going through the test cuz you can lift up your hands and say thank you God and it's a Testament of the Bride of Jesus Christ in these last days amen cuz he's redeemed me all right yes I like to push that back and every time I get a chance he said you don't feel any better than you ever felt when I come out of there I said oh boy if you want to hear me praise God stick around you'll hear me yes sir I mean to praise Him Till Death Shall Set Me Free yes sir let it let it be little big whatever it is he's worthy of all praise and glory when I spoke to uh to a Baptist Bishop overseer General overseer at the conference he said brother Brandon aren't you ashamed to make such a statement as that I said no sir I said I can for Christ promised it hallelujah it's mine I believe in it Christ died that I could have that privilege amen amen and today I stand still on it Hallelujah yes sir mine because he gave it to me he died and he sent the Holy Ghost to persuade me to take it and it's mine it's yours church tonight do you not realize that Faith cometh by hearing and hearing of the word of God and when you have that Holy Ghost on the inside of you even though the flesh says I don't know if I can do it and even sometimes the spirit gets soow down and low but down in the soul there's a real genuine seed of almighty God that it can't be defeated it can't be dismayed even though you might have had a bad day at work even though you might have a lot of things going on wrong at home there is still something a deep colar to the Deep there's something on the inside of you that says I'll praise God no matter what I'll praise him anyway I'll praise him through it it's your confession yes my brother yes glory to God now yes sir brother bam says now he can't do nothing for you until you confess it amen amen amen I'm just going to be straight tonight you know we can't be the church member that comes and Crosses his arms and say God bless me if you can God we can't be the church member that comes and and just sits there and say well I wonder if brother Steven's going to preach tonight or or or a visiting Minister and if they do I hope they preach good enough to get me a little bit excited you will never get anywhere with God under that expectation you will never get anywhere with God like that because what first you have to confess it when you were at home today you should have already been confessing praise God I'm going to go to church tonight I'm going to get what I need God's going to give me a refilling of the Holy Spirit I'm going to get a refilling of the Holy Ghost That Old problem that was bothering me it's going to disappear because he's the high priest that can be touched by the feeling of my infirmities and he said when I pray to him he would answer me but it's got to start with the right attitude it's got to start with the right confession it's got to start with sons and daughters of almighty God believing he's still God and a rewarder of those that diligently diligently diligently seek Him am am am he can't do nothing for you amen amen until you confess it is that right for he is the high preach he says conjunction of your confession amen he can do nothing you confess me before men I'll confess you before the father that's right Hallelujah yes sir is that right amen what you say I done here what what you say I done

that Jesus Is My Healer the high priest stands before God the father and says he's healed my yes sir he's a high priest he said you get that young man he's the high priest of your confession there he

you say My Confession is your word is the truth and every other man is a lie amen amen there you are yes my brother what was the Redemptive blessing he was wounded for our transgressions Bru for our iniquity the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we are healed is that right that's every believer how many Believers we got in here tonight that's every believer there's your confession when you Rose your hand right there you made a DEC declaration you made a confession right there I'm a Believer then the high priest is here to declare to you every Redemptive blessing is yours everything that you need is right here and yours amen amen sometimes I'm going be cornal for me sometimes I get so aggravated I have to go to store to store to store to find what I need I'll have to I just went to four different stores last night trying to find something that I need I am so glad that I don't have to go to this place to find Healing that place to find find Salvation this place to find joy that place to find peace but I can go to my high priest and by the power of my confession I'm not running to and fro but when I go to that high priest and I tell him what I need he goes here's what you need son Glory that's my right that's your right yes sir you got to stop letting the devil beat you up tell you you're no good you're not worth anything the very king of glory that while you were yet a sinner he died for you that you can have whatever you have need of if you confess it yes sir yes yes my brother yes my brother we must we must we must have a positive confession amen amen must yes sir you know I don't believe no sir I don't believe for one second that Jesus Christ when he was in the flesh he was walking around kicking rocks talking about how sad he was and how depressed he was that he had to come down in human flesh and die for the sins of the world I tell you he had a reason to be uhh he had a reason to be sad but he wouldn't be sad but because the joy that was set before him he was joyful all the time happy all the time had a positive confession I come in my father's name me and my father are one he said I do nothing but that is pleasing to the father and let me tell you something if that was Christ how do us people with the name Christians how do us people bearing his name expect for people to see the lovely Lord Jesus Christ when we're walking around with our heads hung low oh come on church we are the Most Blessed people on the face of the planet God has revealed to you the message of the hour he shows you where you're coming from he showed you where you're going we ain't got no right to be depressed we ain't got no right to hang our head low I say it's time for us to wake up it's time for us to realize we're the Sons and Daughters of almighty God it's time this is my time this is your time it's going home [Music] time yes my brother I got everything I ever need when I'm sick I got a Healer to go toen [Music] amen yes

needed right we're just too scared to confess it that's right we have a high priest yes sir I you know Church think about this uhhuh go ahead my brother have you ever looked at the Old Testament Saints uhhuh was looking at Shamar and you know one day yes sir year after year the enemy kept coming and taking what was his took his Joy took his food yes sir took his took the food from his children right depressed his family the whole home was in distress right but one day one day yes sir he decided to make a confession am one day he decided to confess I'm a Seed of Abraham am I am a Seed of Abraham and I've had just about enough of this you know maybe ever ever ever I'm just going to put it in words that that I know might be relatable maybe every day he said sure you sure I I believe the message of the hour for his day uhhuh and he'd be going I I believe I believe I believe but every time the devil would come around he would just run and hide a little bit right too scared to do anything right but you know one day he begin to look at the scriptures yes sir and he begin to remember I'm a Seed of Abraham and he done promise Abraham that that seed would possess every gate every enemy gate so one day he finally said you know I confess amen I confess amen I confess amen I'm a son of Abraham amen maybe he went out there and he told his wife I don't know if I'll be back but I'll tell you what I'm going to die for my god-given rights today I'm going to give everything I got for everything that's mine honey I'm going to war with the devil and I ain't taking it back amen I'm going to confess it and I'm not taking it back where's my Ox gold amen give me my Ox gold honey I confess it I should have fought this enemy a long time ago that's right I should have took him out a long time ago but today it changes for the family of shamgar and he went running out there and the devil was laughing at him but the devil forgot the promise the devil had forgot the promise that shamgar could take down any enemy every enemy that was at his gat amen and he ran out there and by his confession the Holy Spirit the Holy Ghost dropped on him men of old moved by the Holy Ghost it fell on him glory to God just move by the Holy Ghost that's right yes my just moved by the Holy Ghost he took up that Ox God and killed 600 Philistines I said how much more can a people that's full of the Holy Ghost take a hold of the Redemptive word of God Amen maybe you have the testimony of Shamar I should have killed this a long time ago right I should have stopped this a long time ago but today is the day that the Lord hath made and I'm done with it I'm sick of it if shamgar could do that if David could look right in the face face of Goliath and begin to confess you come at me with a sword and the spear that's right but I come to you in the name of the Lord amen amen amen amen someone started remembering Their Blessings I Tri forget not all his benefits no sir he began to [Music] [Applause] remember he begin to remember God done promise yes sir God done promise David you're going to royalty yes my brother you're anointed for this David the prophets not anointed you don't you

en able I don't know what you're crying about and what you're crying about and he went down all 10 minutes and said I don't know what y'all crying about that's it that's it my brother I don't know if you remember the same God yes sir that brought us out of Egypt is the same God right here right now and if that God said I can take that land then these people were bred for my victory and Caleb could cry out give me my mountain my where's my Mountain that's right give me that mountain amen if Joshua moved by the Holy Ghost amen could say I don't care what these denominations are doing I don't care what all y'all want to say if you want to worship the gods Before the Flood do it but as for me and my house he made a confession we're going to serve the Lord amen amen I'm here to say the amorites be upon you the amorites are everywhere but what about your Mountain that's right what about your household that's right if David and shamgar and Caleb and Joshua under the top of bulls and goats they didn't have a high priest like we have they had a man representing them a a sex sin born man but we have the Virgin born sinless spotless high priest glory amen if David could conquer Giants under that blood yes sir under his confession yes sir if shamgar could say 600 just ain't enough Hallelujah if Caleb as an old man could say give me my Mountain that's right how much more under the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ amen should we be able to stand up and confess this is my Mountain this is my Mountain my family is my inheritance they're my family amen amen if Joshua could stand up for his family I believe the bride in the last day has a right to hold up her token and say not my family Satan amen amen glory to God but we have a high priest yes my brother yes sir yes my brother yes sir asking it shall be given amen seeking you shall find it knock and it shall be open to you the problem is we're too scared to claim it ain't nothing wrong with the word no sir ain't nothing wrong with the word heavens and earth will pass away but that word will never change amen amen people tried to shut that word up and the spirit of God stops moving in the church but I'm here to tell you I'll take the word I'll take the full word of God amen amen amen I can confess this yes my brother yes sir glory to God Jesus said unto me if thou can't believe all things are possible amen amen amen says what are you scared about uhhuh are you afraid to take his word for anything uh-huh Lord Don't Be Afraid call the thing right yes sir I'm an heir to this amen oh I don't deserve it but I'm a Heir anyhow amen amen that's it because I'm an heir I receive it amen that's it that's it there you are because I'm an heir that's it amen we're heir of Salvation amen heir of the holy spirit amen I'm an heir because Jesus Paid the price that's it you know church God forbid but if something were to happen to me and I went on beyond the curtain of Time Lord took me you know there's a little boy in this building named LW and take coffee he's my son don't matter how he grows up to be he's an heir amen he's an heir amen he's an heir of what I have amen and you're an heir of what Jesus did for you amen amen amen Jesus Paid the price nothing I had to do I just fell air to it amen sir I'm Healed because I'm an heir to it my diseases are gone my Affliction is gone why because I'm an heir to it oh perfect assurance Jesus is mine oh what a foretaste of Glory Divine heir of Salvation purchased of God born of his Spirit washed in his blood that's our story amen oh then Satan can't stand that see because he's defeated being nothing but a bluff Jesus paid the price called us by his grace we air what a perfect setup that is see he's already defeated I never defeated him Christ defeated him I'm just claiming my own god-given privileges amen that's all you do you just tell Satan get away from here I've got an abstract Deed on this building it's mine I'm air to it yes sir it's our god-given right church amen it's not our god-given right to be depressed it's not our god-given right to have fear it's not our god-given right to have anxiety around us all the time no sir no sir I'm worried about tomorrow why worry about tomorrow we know all tomorrow it's not our god-given right to walk around this body sick and hurting all the time but it's our God given right to claim the Privileges of almighty God amen amen amen amen amen glory to God yes my brother Church yes sir you can call me crazy but I'm just crazy enough to believe this Bible amen you can call me whatever you want to but at the end of the day you better believe Seth coffee believes this Bible I don't care what medical science says when Medical Science says there's no hope I just see a greater testimony that's it I don't worry about what the doctor says I'm not worried about what the devil says I've got a high priest I've got a high priest that said when you lay hands on the sick they shall recover and I stand up here service after service and I say I'm going to lay my hands on you and over and over and over and over again people are healed amen why cuz they confess God's word that's it John 14 he said if you ask ask anything in my name I'll do it and you know what when I don't know what to do and I need something I got and I don't know the answer I have the answer yes sir when Seth coffee don't have the answer I know I can turn to when something's too big for me to handle I have a high priest that I can turn to amen amen you see I've seen the name of Jesus yes sir I have claimed that benefit I have confessed it with my mouth yes sir if you ask anything in my name I'll do it that's exactly right and I say Lord I take you at your word that's right you Lord yes sir and there's a high priest that says he really believes it and he grants it amen you know I've seen I I've seen suicidal spirits on people oppressive spirits on people where people actually like they were going to kill themselves and would have done it had it not been for St John 14 uh-huh greater work but you know what we have a high priest yes sir that's standing in the middle that's standing in the Gap amen I held that boy in my arms and we were praying and praying and praying the boy was going to kill himself but while we were praying sir the high priest be to stick a a scripture right in front of my face eyes closed I could see a Bible open up and I seen St John 14:14 if you ask anything in my name I'll do it and I said father this scripture has come before me that's it and in your name in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we rebuke this suicidal spirit amen amen and when we did a light came down from the sky and fell into that boy and a Darkness went out of that boy why it's the confession of your faith I say again if sham gar David and Joshua could do that what could we do in the name of Jesus what could we do in the name of our high priest what could we do with our confession and say oh brother but you don't understand how am I going to confess over this I've got a problem that's so big I I've got lust demons I've got I've got pornography demons I've got a cancer demon on me and you got all those names and let me tell you there is a name amen that comes with the beneficial package of being a son and daughter of almighty God we have benefits tonight that no matter what we're going through no matter what we're facing God gave us a name that's above every name that at the name of Jesus cancer shall bow Co should bow lust should bow stress should bow anxiety should bow everything bows to
