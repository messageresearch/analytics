[40:17] to date with the sermon let me see your
[40:19] hand this is my routine here that's to
[40:22] check and to know where everybody is
[40:24] amen how many are reading their Cod book
[40:28] and the church ages
[40:30] okay okay we still have somebody
[40:33] pressing amen remember this coming
[40:36] Saturday April 8th we have our music
[40:40] session part two we already did part one
[40:43] and we will approach the subject on
[40:46] music again part two and try to wind up
[40:48] completely so you know when you're
[40:51] listening to a contemporary
[40:53] or an old Christian music you know how
[40:56] to gauge it which one to pick and which
[40:59] not to pick even though it says
[41:01] Christian but it doesn't mean that it
[41:04] belongs to God everybody okay so
[41:06] remember Saturday that will be here
[41:09] April 8th uh four o'clock the whole
[41:13] church
[41:14] can participate it's open to the entire
[41:17] church but musicians are required
[41:20] because you need to know what you're
[41:22] doing amen by the whole church you're
[41:24] welcome you can come in and participate
[41:27] it's important so whenever you worship
[41:29] God at home or you're on YouTube surfing
[41:31] for something you know what to get and
[41:34] what not to get amen this is not the
[41:37] time for junk food
[41:39] everybody okay we already got the reveal
[41:42] word of the hour so let's fix on what is
[41:45] the best already what has been
[41:47] Vindicated and proven by God Almighty
[41:50] amen there was a a song this morning
[41:54] that uh it's an old song probably and he
[41:58] was playing and when I listened to it
[42:00] and I caught something there they say
[42:03] three people were put in the grave
[42:05] and one came out and two were still down
[42:08] I say that's not true
[42:10] there is one of the thief of the cross
[42:13] that came out from the girl
[42:15] so you see what I'm saying so when you
[42:17] listen to the song even though it looks
[42:19] good it's an old song established for a
[42:22] long time you gotta gauge it according
[42:24] to the filter and the filter is not my
[42:27] filter
[42:28] it is the word of God it starts from the
[42:31] scripture and it's back up by the
[42:33] message of the hour because the Bible
[42:35] and the message are completely
[42:38] everybody okay glory to God on April

[44:48] amen glory to God everything will be
[44:53] okay We Gather baby dedication this
[44:56] morning
[44:57] for our new member in spoken word
[45:01] Tabernacle she will she is calm
[45:06] that's my experience
[45:08] that's what I saw calm lovely and she
[45:11] looks staring slowly
[45:13] it's a feminine spirit it's according to
[45:16] the message of the hour if you want a
[45:18] coach you see me I'll give it to you
[45:20] she's a true woman
[45:24] everybody okay and I like it she looks
[45:27] beautiful
[45:28] amen her name is Sister Ariana
[45:31] amen but before I call the parent let me
[45:34] read something I always want the
[45:36] scripture and back it up with the
[45:38] message of the hour then we know we're
[45:40] stable
[45:41] everybody okay because there is a
[45:43] difference between the word of God and
[45:44] the will of God
[45:48] you know that right
[45:49] you know that right
[45:51] you know that right when Noah built the
[45:54] ark that was the word of God
[45:56] and in Noah's time that was the will of
[45:59] God
[46:01] everybody okay but today it is still the
[46:05] word of God
[46:07] but it's not the will of God for us to
[46:10] build the ark of Noah
[46:13] everybody okay
[46:14] everybody okay so the crust that was
[46:17] expressing Noah was The Superficial
[46:20] layer
[46:22] there was another layer under there
[46:25] now today when we get in nowhere we are
[46:27] pulling something else
[46:29] that is the word for this entire
[46:32] everybody okay so Moses can go to Egypt
[46:35] and say hey yeah I need to come out
[46:37] that's the word of God and that was the
[46:39] will of God but today are you living in
[46:42] Egypt
[46:43] you in America
[46:46] it's still the word of God but it's not
[46:49] the will of God if I take you out of
[46:51] America where am I going to take you
[46:53] am I going to use a boat or an airplane
[46:56] but I know how to take you off from
[46:58] America
[47:01] it'll be a different way
[47:03] amen that will be called The Rapture so
[47:06] there is a difference between the word
[47:07] of God and the will of God
[47:11] everybody clear it's coming up pretty
[47:13] good
[47:14] Luke chapter 18 verse 15 the Bible say
[47:18] and they brought unto him also infant
[47:21] babies amen that he would touch them
[47:26] but when his disciples saw it they
[47:29] rebuked them hopefully there is nobody
[47:31] here that have a problem with baby
[47:33] dedication
[47:34] whether you have a problem or not I'm
[47:37] gonna dedicate the baby
[47:39] everybody okay but Jesus called them
[47:41] unto him and say suffer lead the
[47:44] children to come unto me and forbid them
[47:47] not for such of such is the kingdom of
[47:50] who God Brother Brad I'm saying the
[47:53] message token after the opening of the
[47:55] seals you know when a silly the fellows

[53:45] word brother Caleb I would need some
[53:47] battery it looks like this is running
[53:48] out quickly this is just the house
[53:50] cleaning Amen brother Branham say Amen
[53:53] children
[53:54] do you know
[53:55] how to obey yourself in the house of God
[53:59] do you know this is the sanctuary of God
[54:03] God is in his holy
[54:06] let everybody keep water
[54:08] it is the place of God where people are
[54:11] coming
[54:13] they are coming meditating
[54:15] trying to find Salvation to the soul
[54:18] trying to find the problems of the
[54:21] people's life try to help someone so the
[54:24] least you can do is to be how
[54:27] and be how so get your drink of water
[54:31] before water
[54:35] everybody okay so before service start
[54:37] Mama make sure the children goes to the
[54:40] restroom make sure they get your the
[54:42] drink and make sure they stay in a
[54:44] sanctuary amen moving back and forth my
[54:47] back and forth that's not a good habit
[54:49] amen if a child is diabetic bring it to
[54:52] me and then let's pray for that child
[54:55] we want him to be here or her to be
[54:57] healed amen so everybody should be
[55:00] healthy amen get your drink of water
[55:03] before church start and no leader wants
[55:06] hairs to have drinks mothers that's got
[55:08] those little fellows if you sit near the
[55:11] water
[55:12] keep them just as water as they should
[55:16] never be a whisper never one whisper we
[55:20] are all
[55:21] but when that Bible is read and that
[55:25] Minister enters the pulpit we should be
[55:28] how waiting on the now please try to do
[55:33] everybody clear so far as we preparing
[55:36] for our
[55:38] service
[55:40] I had a question
[55:42] from what was preached last time and it
[55:45] was about the last portion of the sermon
[55:48] which dealt with the New Jerusalem being
[55:51] the bride and the New Jerusalem being
[55:54] also a city how many struggle with that
[56:01] okay I know you're just shy
[56:05] you know in your heart amen somebody
[56:08] asked me a question and put on a
[56:10] question and answer a box so they say
[56:11] that the house
[56:13] mentioned is not made of mortal clay Etc
[56:16] what about the chair that is the hope so
[56:19] there is he the only houses is uh his
[56:22] only houses not Furnishing or Furnishing
[56:25] or something like that in other words
[56:27] what about the chair that happened over
[56:29] there so if I move on with what I have
[56:33] we can get lost somewhere
[56:35] so I want to make sure we refocus a
[56:38] little bit and everybody is on the same
[56:40] page if you miss it I know somebody miss
[56:43] it if you miss it it's gonna get it if
[56:45] you already get it may the Lord open up
[56:47] so we can establish this and move
[56:49] forward this is already a preparation
[56:52] for Easter
[56:53] usually like I was talking one time to
[56:56] brother Chad we don't have uh a sermon
[56:59] for Mother's Day and things but sometime
[57:01] like this time I felt him moving toward
[57:04] the preparation for Easter so we're
[57:05] already preparing and we are already
[57:07] entering Easter with this sermon but
[57:09] before I can move forward let's go
[57:11] straight quickly into uh Second
[57:15] Corinthians chapter five and let's
[57:17] establish this quickly and then we move
[57:19] to our sermon
[57:21] I wanted to do that on Friday and you
[57:23] told me to do that on Wednesday you
[57:25] might be seated with this I will
[57:29] I'm sorry I appreciate your respect to
[57:32] the word
[57:36] hopefully this won't take too long
[57:42] second Corinthians chapter five
[57:46] because if you don't get this right
[57:49] you will not understand what comes up in
[57:51] the rapture
[57:56] everybody good
[57:58] glory to God if you there you can say
[58:00] Amen
[58:02] second Corinthians chapter 5 the Bible
[58:05] says for we know that if our Earthly
[58:09] house
[58:10] the Bible is calling this a house I want
[58:12] you to understand the terminology now
[58:14] because the question is about when is
[58:17] the New Jerusalem the bride and when is
[58:20] the New Jerusalem City I thought the New
[58:22] Jerusalem is a city how does it turn up
[58:25] to be the bride again
[58:27] that was the question amen so if you
[58:30] miss it just pay attention
[58:33] for we know that if our Earthly house
[58:36] so if you look at the terminology of the
[58:39] Bible the Bible does not call this a
[58:43] body now it's calling this a house
[58:46] everybody okay
[58:48] a house of this Tabernacle will
[58:50] dissolved we have a water building
[58:54] a building of hope God so this building
[58:58] is made by God
[59:00] what kind of material is this building
[59:04] so there is a building
[59:06] that is made by God
[59:09] made by God
[59:12] amen
[59:13] God is a spirit
[59:15] everybody okay
[59:17] a house
[59:20] so when we say building you need to be
[59:22] careful in the scripture what are you
[59:24] talking about it is a building it is a
[59:26] house amen a house not made with water
[59:31] hence let's stop right there why is it
[59:33] not made with hands what does it mean
[59:37] in other words it is not a natural house
[59:41] because the house that are made by hand
[59:44] are made out of stone
[59:47] everybody okay or wood or clay or mortar
[59:52] or precious stone whatever you can do it
[59:55] Paul gave us those detail when he spoke
[59:58] in First Corinthians chapter three you
[59:59] know that right
[1:00:01] do you know that
[1:00:04] you know that
[1:00:07] keep your finger right here let's go to
[1:00:10] First Corinthians chapter 3.
[1:00:13] we're gonna go back again to Second
[1:00:14] Corinthians I'll let the Holy Spirit
[1:00:16] move on Amen First Corinthians chapter 3
[1:00:20] verse 12. if you don't know don't be shy
[1:00:23] we in a family just say Pastor I don't
[1:00:26] know
[1:00:29] Pride will kill you
[1:00:32] Pride will kill you
[1:00:34] amen
[1:00:36] verse 12 you there
[1:00:38] now if any man built upon this Water
[1:00:41] Foundation he built with water gold or
[1:00:44] water silver or water precious stone oh
[1:00:47] what wood or water hey or water you see
[1:00:51] different materials
[1:00:53] everybody okay now so let's go back to
[1:00:55] first to second Corinthians
[1:00:57] we okay now so this house is not made
[1:01:01] with hand in other words when you see
[1:01:04] this house in heaven
[1:01:05] amen the material that the house is made
[1:01:09] out is not the material we use here on
[1:01:12] our Earth for our construction here
[1:01:16] we okay now I'm reading the scripture
[1:01:18] first so you can pick up on brother
[1:01:20] Branham if you don't know you're going
[1:01:22] to miss Bradham this house is not made
[1:01:25] with hand so it's not humanly made it
[1:01:28] doesn't even have human material on it
[1:01:30] comma but it's eternal hell in the
[1:01:34] heavens so this house is in heaven and
[1:01:36] it's an eternal House show me one house
[1:01:38] in this earth that is eternal
[1:01:42] this can perish
[1:01:44] amen
[1:01:45] if they bring a dynamite they put it
[1:01:47] here it's gone but this house is eternal
[1:01:51] if the house is eternal what kind of
[1:01:54] material is he made out of
[1:01:57] amen temporal material
[1:02:00] it must be Eternal material about who is
[1:02:03] eternal
[1:02:06] everybody okay God is the only one who's
[1:02:08] Eternal and God make a house that is
[1:02:11] eternal so is that house really A house
[1:02:15] good question
[1:02:18] everybody okay is he really a building
[1:02:22] that house is in heaven
[1:02:26] everybody okay
[1:02:27] verse two
[1:02:29] the Bible say for in this in this house
[1:02:32] in our body we groan earnestly Desiring
[1:02:35] to be clothed upon with our house
[1:02:39] how can you how can you put the clothes
[1:02:42] a house on you
[1:02:45] everybody okay
[1:02:46] everybody okay if I give you a house and
[1:02:50] you go find the house so you will take
[1:02:51] the house and say I'm gonna put my house
[1:02:53] on me and you start walking and people
[1:02:55] say oh they are they are wearing the
[1:02:58] house we already what kind of house can
[1:03:00] you put as a clothing
[1:03:02] you understand now now it becomes clear
[1:03:06] we clear now
[1:03:08] he says we would like to be close upon
[1:03:11] with our hearts which is for what heaven
[1:03:15] so that house that is in heaven easy is
[1:03:17] not this kind of house it is a house
[1:03:20] that you can put it on you I'm not gonna
[1:03:23] get into that today it's for Easter
[1:03:26] everybody okay you need to get the house
[1:03:29] and put it on you how can you put a
[1:03:31] house on you
[1:03:33] remember this is a house
[1:03:35] everybody okay and Paul is saying you're
[1:03:37] gonna take a house and put it on you if
[1:03:40] this is a house and this is a body and
[1:03:44] that is a house so that must be a body
[1:03:49] are we okay I have not touched brother
[1:03:51] Branham at all I'm in the Bible
[1:03:55] we okay now so now we understand that
[1:03:58] this house is a body
[1:04:01] and it's a body that is eternal
[1:04:05] amen so you have another body that is
[1:04:10] eternal that is in heaven and you have a
[1:04:12] body that is temporal that you're living
[1:04:14] on all we want to do is take the Eternal
[1:04:18] house the Eternal Body and put it onto
[1:04:21] this one
[1:04:22] we okay now with that being established
[1:04:25] let's let's see now the two the two New
[1:04:28] Jerusalem
[1:04:31] John chapter 14.
[1:04:33] it was needful right
[1:04:36] John Chapter 14 verse 2 in my father
[1:04:39] water house we need to stop there first
[1:04:42] because that name houses a trouble
[1:04:45] why is it trouble the Bible says in my
[1:04:48] father's house are many water mentions
[1:04:50] let's stop there how can you have a
[1:04:53] house
[1:04:54] anybody okay and you have mentioned
[1:04:57] inside the house does it make sense
[1:05:00] this is a house
[1:05:02] a mansion also is a house how can you
[1:05:05] have a house inside the house but not
[1:05:07] one many houses inside one house
[1:05:10] it's a trouble
[1:05:12] so we need to understand what does it
[1:05:14] mean by the house of the father it's
[1:05:17] what
[1:05:18] we okay
[1:05:21] William Marion Branham he says but in
[1:05:25] the original it is written like this
[1:05:28] in my father's Water Kingdom
[1:05:33] we okay now
[1:05:35] in the Kingdom you can have houses but
[1:05:38] not in the house you have houses
[1:05:40] that's a different thing
[1:05:42] so in my father's house
[1:05:44] brother Branham is interpreting that as
[1:05:48] my father Kingdom
[1:05:53] amen now we make sense brother Branham
[1:05:56] continue he says in my father's kingdom
[1:06:00] is many water policy now we make sense
[1:06:03] but if you notice the tradition of the
[1:06:06] Bible was brought down to England in the
[1:06:10] days of King James when the translator
[1:06:12] translated it and what he was the
[1:06:16] kingdom was a water house and the King
[1:06:18] was a water father it makes sense now
[1:06:21] and all his delegate his subject in his
[1:06:24] domain was his water children brother
[1:06:27] Branham is calling the kingdom a domain
[1:06:35] Oh Glory to God Amen and so making it so
[1:06:40] the people of England will understand
[1:06:42] they translated that way in my father's
[1:06:46] house is many mentioned that means in my
[1:06:49] father's kingdom is many water mentioned
[1:06:52] we clear there
[1:06:54] brother Branham again
[1:06:56] in 60 brother say I think King James had
[1:06:59] that idea they translator when he said
[1:07:02] in my father's house is many water
[1:07:05] mentioned a house was a water domain
[1:07:10] everybody clear so now in my father's
[1:07:14] Kingdom
[1:07:15] in my father's domain
[1:07:19] we okay now we have many mentions
[1:07:25] we okay now
[1:07:26] we have many mentions or we have many
[1:07:29] palaces
[1:07:31] everybody okay or we have many houses
[1:07:35] or we have many buildings
[1:07:39] everybody okay
[1:07:40] we okay now now let's go back to our
[1:07:44] scripture now
[1:07:45] when they say
[1:07:47] the heaven in my father's
[1:07:50] Kingdom or in my father domain
[1:07:54] what we looking at
[1:07:56] we are looking at our cities here
[1:07:59] because when somebody get into your
[1:08:01] house you say you are on my property
[1:08:04] everybody okay meaning that the state
[1:08:06] the city divided the the houses amen
[1:08:10] from here to here is brother Charles
[1:08:12] property from here to here it's brother
[1:08:15] Greg's property that's not the way
[1:08:17] heaven is
[1:08:21] are you staying awake
[1:08:24] ah William Marion Branham in the message
[1:08:27] paradox brother Branham is talking about
[1:08:30] the prophecy he said if you shall notice
[1:08:32] it is punctuated and underlined if you
[1:08:35] notice it's wrote in French spoke in
[1:08:38] French verb before the water because of
[1:08:41] this momentum water decision you know
[1:08:44] that prophecy a huge portion of water
[1:08:46] Heaven awaited
[1:08:48] begin to wonder what is a huge portion
[1:08:51] of Heaven because when we say portion
[1:08:53] we're looking at the property that
[1:08:55] belonged to brother Branham
[1:08:57] we okay now brother Branham said now
[1:09:00] that is what I wondered when I die will
[1:09:04] it be
[1:09:06] then I happen to think Heaven is not
[1:09:10] prop portion of two different portion to
[1:09:14] us up there
[1:09:17] let me read it again Heaven is not
[1:09:20] portion of to different portion to us up
[1:09:23] there
[1:09:24] so Heaven is not divided like the city
[1:09:27] of Gastonia
[1:09:31] we okay now
[1:09:33] everybody okay Heaven is the Water
[1:09:36] Kingdom that is within us one wait for
[1:09:44] are we okay
[1:09:45] Brother Brad I'm saying the heaven
[1:09:47] they're talking about is a kingdom
[1:09:50] and that kingdom is within you but there
[1:09:54] is another one that is waiting
[1:09:58] everybody okay that's why the horse of
[1:10:01] brother Branham and the horse of Junior
[1:10:04] Jackson were on the same breed
[1:10:09] by Junior Jackson horse was just small
[1:10:12] because Bobby Brown was riding on the
[1:10:14] horse and he says that I shall ride this
[1:10:16] train once more I'm not gonna get into
[1:10:18] that let's leave it alone
[1:10:20] everybody okay
[1:10:22] everybody okay everybody good so Heaven
[1:10:26] as we're talking is a kingdom
[1:10:28] but the Bible says the kingdom or the
[1:10:31] doorman there is many mentioned we still
[1:10:34] have our idea that oh so Heaven is cut
[1:10:37] off in portion but I'm saying that's not
[1:10:39] it
[1:10:40] it is a kingdom that kingdom is within
[1:10:43] you but remember what is in you before
[1:10:45] the foundation of the world
[1:10:47] the predestinated seed which produce
[1:10:50] your theophany
[1:10:54] are we okay are we okay in us we got a
[1:10:58] seed
[1:10:59] remember and our seed our theophany was
[1:11:03] only a reflection of acid
[1:11:09] everybody okay and brother Branham said
[1:11:11] that Kingdom you have it in you yes but
[1:11:13] there is another one waiting for
[1:11:16] that Kingdom you already have it but
[1:11:19] there is another one waiting for
[1:11:23] are we together
[1:11:26] we okay now we okay
[1:11:29] let's go now to John 14.
[1:11:32] let's listen to this the Bible says in
[1:11:36] my father's house we understand what he
[1:11:37] means now they are in the present many
[1:11:41] water mentions if he were not so I would
[1:11:45] have water Told You So these houses
[1:11:49] these mentions
[1:11:50] these palaces this building already
[1:11:54] existed and Jesus confirmed that those
[1:11:57] buildings are already there and Jesus
[1:12:00] said if they were not there I would have
[1:12:01] told you in other words I'm confirming
[1:12:04] to you that in heaven we got many
[1:12:07] mentions
[1:12:08] everybody okay and when you have a lot
[1:12:12] of houses
[1:12:13] in a place
[1:12:15] amen a lot of houses in one place makes
[1:12:19] what we call a city that's right
[1:12:23] everybody okay now
[1:12:25] everybody okay now so the beginning of
[1:12:29] this passage Jesus is talking about a
[1:12:32] city that is already in existence
[1:12:39] everybody okay it's already existing
[1:12:43] Jesus said if he was not there I would
[1:12:45] have told you I'm telling you of
[1:12:47] something that is already in heaven in
[1:12:50] heaven in there is a city and that City
[1:12:52] have many mentioned it have many
[1:12:54] Palestine you have many houses you have
[1:12:57] many buildings
[1:13:01] everybody okay
[1:13:03] so in this statement there is a city
[1:13:06] that already is in existence
[1:13:11] and there is also a city
[1:13:13] that is not in existence yet
[1:13:18] everybody okay let me read it again with
[1:13:21] you
[1:13:22] In My Father's House are present many
[1:13:25] water mentions if you were not so I
[1:13:28] would have water told you it's full stop
[1:13:30] period
[1:13:32] now watch the next statement I go to
[1:13:35] water prepared a water place so that
[1:13:39] place is not there yet
[1:13:42] everybody okay so we got two places
[1:13:46] or two cities there is a city that is
[1:13:50] already existed that guy mentioned and
[1:13:53] there is a city to be prepared
[1:14:01] are we okay so now in John Chapter 14
[1:14:04] verse 2 how many cities do we have now
[1:14:07] a city that existed eager houses
[1:14:11] and there is a city that God is going to
[1:14:14] prepare
[1:14:15] everybody okay
[1:14:16] Jesus continue he says that if I go and
[1:14:20] prepare a place for you
[1:14:22] I will come again and receive you unto
[1:14:25] water myself that where I am there he
[1:14:29] may be where also so this place Jesus
[1:14:32] will prepare it so that him and the
[1:14:36] bread might live together
[1:14:41] everybody okay everybody okay so it's a
[1:14:45] place to be prepared for the king
[1:14:48] and his Queen
[1:14:52] have I lost anyone
[1:14:55] so when we are interpreting John chapter
[1:15:00] 14 you need to know which portion is
[1:15:04] brother Branham interpreting
[1:15:07] let me state it again
[1:15:09] when you are talking about John chapter
[1:15:12] 14 right here John chapter 14. make sure
[1:15:17] you check brother Branham is brother
[1:15:20] Branham explaining
[1:15:22] the future city
[1:15:26] or the future home
[1:15:31] everybody okay or is brother Branham is
[1:15:35] planning or translating the existing
[1:15:38] home
[1:15:43] everybody good now let's read brother
[1:15:45] Branham okay we establish the foundation
[1:15:49] I'm sorry
[1:15:51] it's important because that city is
[1:15:54] calling
[1:15:55] which city talk
[1:15:57] can this city talk
[1:15:59] but there is a city that is coming
[1:16:03] everybody okay there is a Teo funny that
[1:16:07] is
[1:16:08] and telling you do what
[1:16:11] come up how
[1:16:13] so you are low
[1:16:17] everybody okay everybody okay can I
[1:16:21] continue
[1:16:22] okay William Marion Branham now let's
[1:16:25] read it together
[1:16:26] brother Branham say I have never
[1:16:28] believed that heaven was a place where
[1:16:31] there is a bunch of water buildings
[1:16:33] where there is a bunch of water houses
[1:16:36] up there made with water water it's
[1:16:39] clear
[1:16:40] the material
[1:16:43] didn't say there is no houses in heaven
[1:16:46] he's talking about the housing that are
[1:16:49] not made with this kind of material you
[1:16:53] don't have it in heaven because these
[1:16:55] materials are subject to the gravity if
[1:16:58] I put a stone right here I let it go the
[1:17:01] Earth will pull it down everybody okay
[1:17:03] that's what brother Branham he said you
[1:17:05] need to be very careful with brother
[1:17:06] Branham it's a Ministry of the son of
[1:17:09] man
[1:17:10] it is the ministry like the ministry of
[1:17:12] Jesus Christ so if you don't pay
[1:17:14] attention because Jesus one time came
[1:17:16] out from the temple he looked at the
[1:17:18] temple he said destroy this body I will
[1:17:20] build it in three days
[1:17:22] and the people came out with that saved
[1:17:24] the Lord we have that saved the Lord
[1:17:26] Jesus said that they saw this Temple he
[1:17:28] will build it in three days and they
[1:17:29] accuse him for that
[1:17:32] if they would have a recorded they would
[1:17:35] have shown to the court and said Jesus
[1:17:37] is lying because Jesus says that
[1:17:41] destroyed this Temple he will build it
[1:17:43] in three days it is on recording on
[1:17:45] YouTube
[1:17:48] but the scripture say that Jesus was not
[1:17:52] talking about the temple he was talking
[1:17:54] about his honor
[1:17:56] so you gotta be very careful
[1:18:02] everybody good
[1:18:04] all right brother random say where there
[1:18:08] is a bunch of houses where up there made
[1:18:11] with murder dub up with water paper
[1:18:13] paint under one I have never believed
[1:18:17] that a water supernatural being brother
[1:18:19] Branham is talking about the
[1:18:21] supernatural being
[1:18:23] so a supernatural being needed
[1:18:26] Supernatural house
[1:18:29] you need to understand William Marion
[1:18:31] brother
[1:18:32] that's why people leave the message they
[1:18:34] don't understand you need to have the
[1:18:36] Holy Ghost that work with brother pranam
[1:18:39] to make you understand brother Branham
[1:18:42] [Music]
[1:18:44] everybody okay he said I don't believe
[1:18:46] that is Supernatural being would have
[1:18:49] lived in the water literal house now we
[1:18:51] make sense watch what brother Branham is
[1:18:54] interpreting in John chapter 14.
[1:18:58] watch the portion brother Branham say I
[1:19:01] believe when Jesus spoke in John 14 in
[1:19:05] my father house is many water mentioned
[1:19:08] do you see brother Brown I'm saying I go
[1:19:09] to prepare a place
[1:19:11] so which portion is brother Brown I'm
[1:19:13] interpreting
[1:19:14] brother Branham is interpreting the
[1:19:16] houses that are already in existence or
[1:19:20] the city that is already existing and
[1:19:22] brother brand name stopped there but
[1:19:24] brother Branham does not touch I will go
[1:19:26] to prepare your house
[1:19:28] you see now be careful how you're
[1:19:31] reading the prophet push the break go
[1:19:33] slow 15 miles an hour school zone
[1:19:36] everybody okay okay brother Brown I'm
[1:19:39] saying in my father's house is many
[1:19:41] water he stopped right there in the
[1:19:44] middle he said he meant this portion not
[1:19:48] that God to prepare that's a future home
[1:19:50] he meant a water a body a water dwelling
[1:19:54] place
[1:19:55] make sense
[1:19:57] make sense now for the scripture
[1:19:59] verified there same thing and I say if
[1:20:02] this Earthly water be dissolved we have
[1:20:05] one water already waiting so this first
[1:20:08] portion of John 13 is talking about
[1:20:12] houses of theophany
[1:20:19] everybody okay so what was already
[1:20:21] existing are your Teo fania day and when
[1:20:25] you have a manatee orphanies they make
[1:20:28] many houses or many mansions or many
[1:20:32] buildings or many palaces and a bunch of
[1:20:35] theophany a bunch of houses a bunch of
[1:20:38] palaces a bunch of buildings make the
[1:20:41] city
[1:20:43] in other words the bride represented in
[1:20:46] heaven is a city of theophany
[1:20:49] [Applause]
[1:20:54] everybody clear so far
[1:20:57] let me continue brother Bradham says
[1:20:59] mortal being is the only one who lives
[1:21:03] in water habitation made with hand
[1:21:06] Immortal beings live in water Immortal
[1:21:09] habitation these habitation are the
[1:21:11] houses the theophany amen then the place
[1:21:15] that we go until we return back is not a
[1:21:18] place of water break you see the
[1:21:20] material on water and water or water
[1:21:24] pressure or water it's a place echo of
[1:21:27] condition that we move out of this
[1:21:30] Dimension that we live in into another
[1:21:32] dimension it is a house a water a water
[1:21:36] dwelling place everybody okay remember
[1:21:39] brother Branham is only interpreting the
[1:21:41] first portion
[1:21:45] everybody clear let me go back again I
[1:21:48] have to nail this before I move forward
[1:21:50] in John 14 brother Branham again he says
[1:21:53] when he says in my father house is many
[1:21:57] water mentioned did you see brother
[1:21:58] Branham continuing
[1:22:01] his Subway
[1:22:03] why is he stopping there because this is
[1:22:05] what I'm about to talk not the preparing
[1:22:08] the preparing is a different city we
[1:22:11] okay now brother Brandon said speaking
[1:22:14] to his disciple before going away I can
[1:22:16] imagine that being of water stones why
[1:22:19] because these are theophany
[1:22:21] they are Eternal houses they cannot be
[1:22:24] made of stone they cannot be made of
[1:22:26] clay or murder
[1:22:28] everybody okay stone or brick and Mortal
[1:22:31] I believe the Tabernacle he was speaking
[1:22:33] of was another body to water living in
[1:22:37] my father has his many water Tabernacles
[1:22:40] destroy this Tabernacle and I shall
[1:22:43] raise it up in water three days and
[1:22:45] again if this Earthly Tabernacle be
[1:22:47] water we have warm water prepared
[1:22:52] we clear now we're clear now this is why
[1:22:56] brother Branham make this statement
[1:22:59] best city he goes ahead and say which is
[1:23:02] the water you Jerusalem the New
[1:23:04] Jerusalem I will shall put him there I
[1:23:07] shall put on him the new water Jerusalem
[1:23:09] now the bread
[1:23:12] [Applause]
[1:23:16] now you understand
[1:23:19] you understand now
[1:23:21] how many knows that the church itself is
[1:23:24] the new one Jerusalem you believe that
[1:23:26] let's just prove it in Revelation water
[1:23:29] 21.
[1:23:33] revelation 21.
[1:23:35] we okay
[1:23:37] brother Branham say first two John says
[1:23:39] and I John saw a water a holy city the
[1:23:43] water you Jerusalem when we say that the
[1:23:46] first thing you see is buildings
[1:23:49] everybody okay but watch again
[1:23:51] Revelation 21 and you will understand
[1:23:54] coming down from heaven from God out of
[1:23:58] water Heaven prepare us a water why are
[1:24:01] Dawn for water your husband how can a
[1:24:04] city be prepared as a brother
[1:24:08] let's continue
[1:24:10] first man and they came unto me one of
[1:24:13] the Seven Angels which had the seven
[1:24:15] valve full of the seven last uh of the
[1:24:18] seven last plague and talk with me
[1:24:20] saying come on either I will show you
[1:24:23] the bride then Lambs what the wife now
[1:24:27] we want to know who is the wife of the
[1:24:29] Lamb
[1:24:30] amen because your house is not a male
[1:24:34] house who's gonna marry a female house
[1:24:38] we don't build metal house and then we
[1:24:41] built a female house and they get
[1:24:42] married
[1:24:44] everybody Okay we okay
[1:24:47] but but the Bible says I will show you
[1:24:49] Deborah the water so we expect that to
[1:24:53] be a woman
[1:24:55] right it is the what the lamb is a man
[1:24:58] John the Baptist say behold there
[1:25:01] that was a man so if he has a wife the
[1:25:04] wife must be water a woman so when they
[1:25:07] say come see the brother you must hear
[1:25:10] what
[1:25:10] so let's see the woman
[1:25:14] everybody okay
[1:25:16] the Bible says and he Carry Me Away in
[1:25:19] the spirit to a great high water
[1:25:22] mountain and show me the greatest city
[1:25:25] is Jesus gonna marry a city
[1:25:31] everybody okay
[1:25:33] is Jesus gonna marry a building
[1:25:36] but the bride which is the Lamb's wife
[1:25:39] is a city
[1:25:44] why because in John 14 there is two New
[1:25:48] Jerusalem there is a New Jerusalem made
[1:25:51] of the blood of Jesus Christ and there
[1:25:54] is another New Jerusalem which is a city
[1:26:00] everybody good everybody good
[1:26:03] the Bible continue he said he showed me
[1:26:05] a great water City the holy Jerusalem
[1:26:08] descending Out of Heaven from who God
[1:26:11] and that City have many water why many
[1:26:15] mentioned because the Bible says in
[1:26:17] First Corinthians 12 12 for us the body
[1:26:20] is one which is the bread and have many
[1:26:23] members many mentioned and all the
[1:26:27] members of that one body being how many
[1:26:30] are what one so also is who Christ
[1:26:39] everybody okay
[1:26:41] take a man
[1:26:44] amen
[1:26:46] this part here is Christ
[1:26:50] this part here is the body of Christ
[1:26:54] it is made of many members but all the
[1:26:58] members from
[1:27:03] everybody okay and the Bible says that
[1:27:06] the body which is the bread of Jesus
[1:27:09] Christ which is the Lamb's what is a
[1:27:11] city
[1:27:14] it's a bunch of building
[1:27:16] so if the body is a city it's building
[1:27:19] so the land also must be a building
[1:27:25] let's go to revelation 21.
[1:27:28] and then we go to our sermon quick
[1:27:34] uh uh glory to God Revelation 21 verse
[1:27:39] 22. if you dare you can say Amen
[1:27:45] that's a whole sermon preached brother
[1:27:47] Robert
[1:27:51] Revelation 21 verse 22 if you dare you
[1:27:54] can say Amen
[1:27:56] few people
[1:27:59] and I saw no Temple they win
[1:28:02] for the Lord God Almighty
[1:28:05] and the lamb are the water the Temple of
[1:28:08] it
[1:28:10] so the lamb is now a
[1:28:15] because the bread is a city
[1:28:19] [Music]
[1:28:21] this is spiritual
[1:28:23] everybody okay this has nothing to do
[1:28:26] with the natural yet I am still on the
[1:28:28] top here I am right here
[1:28:32] this is all spiritual
[1:28:33] and watch again verse 20 23 and the City
[1:28:40] is had no need of sun neither of the
[1:28:44] Moon to channel
[1:28:46] for the glory of God did water lighten
[1:28:49] it and the lamb is the lights there walk
[1:28:53] on the temple is a light
[1:28:57] everybody okay they say the lamb is a
[1:29:00] temple now the lamb himself that is the
[1:29:03] temple is a light
[1:29:05] what kind of Temple is like
[1:29:09] what kind of house is a light
[1:29:13] it is the theophany
[1:29:17] everybody okay who is the theophany he
[1:29:21] is the great Melchizedek
[1:29:24] and the bread is also theophanese
[1:29:28] we okay we are the city of the lamb and
[1:29:31] he is the temple in the city that's
[1:29:34] spiritually speaking everybody okay
[1:29:36] that's why brother Ibraham says this
[1:29:39] brother say notice Jerusalem the word
[1:29:42] Jerusalem is from above the Bible say
[1:29:45] which is the mother of what that's all
[1:29:48] how can the city be a mother
[1:29:51] a mother means he have children
[1:29:54] they didn't say a woman a mother a
[1:29:56] mother means she already got children so
[1:29:59] this city got children how can children
[1:30:02] how can a city be mother and a mother is
[1:30:05] a woman meaning that there is a father
[1:30:07] of the city
[1:30:10] everybody okay everybody okay the Bible
[1:30:13] said which is the mother of us
[1:30:16] and Christ is our mother we realize that
[1:30:20] God is our mother for we are born of who

[1:33:21] Revelation 21 because the scripture have
[1:33:24] a compound meaning
[1:33:27] everybody okay
[1:33:28] to give you a last example so it will
[1:33:31] help whoever was struggling in
[1:33:34] Revelation 17 verse 1 the Bible say
[1:33:37] there came one of the Seven Angels
[1:33:39] remember again which had seven vows the
[1:33:42] same angel that showed abroad and talk
[1:33:44] with me saying unto me come here I will
[1:33:46] show unto thee the Judgment of a greater
[1:33:48] a is a man or a woman
[1:33:52] that seed is upon many Waters
[1:33:55] so if he say a a whole lot we need
[1:33:57] to see a woman verse 3 so he Carry Me
[1:34:00] Away in the spirit in the wilderness
[1:34:04] we clear now
[1:34:06] amen let's see who that woman is
[1:34:10] brother Branham say the Bible said sit
[1:34:12] upon a scarlet color Beast full of the
[1:34:15] name of blasphemies having seven heads
[1:34:17] and ten horn we already went through
[1:34:18] this verse 18 and the woman which you
[1:34:22] saw is the greatest City
[1:34:28] any question
[1:34:29] that city is the Vatican it is a natural
[1:34:33] City but it's also a church a Catholic
[1:34:37] church so the bread is also a natural
[1:34:41] City the New Jerusalem but the bread
[1:34:44] also is a church
[1:34:46] because every Church age was a city FSS
[1:34:50] was a city Samina was a city pergamos
[1:34:54] was a city that tired was a city so this
[1:34:57] was a City Philadelphia was a city La
[1:35:00] audisia was a city but we got what we
[1:35:03] called the broad Edge
[1:35:04] there is no City for that one that city
[1:35:08] is the New Jerusalem
[1:35:10] and the bread being the New Jerusalem
[1:35:12] will live in the New Jerusalem so the
[1:35:16] New Jerusalem and the New Jerusalem were
[1:35:19] married together in that city where the
[1:35:22] lamb is there in the city where they
[1:35:25] cometh know I have a mention over there
[1:35:28] and free from tools and care I am going
[1:35:31] where the lamb is there
[1:35:33] any question
[1:35:39] any question we clear now
[1:35:43] let's go to our scripture John 14.
[1:35:46] job 14.
[1:35:54] I don't know where I am
[1:35:56] thank you here my brother
[1:35:58] I don't know where I am in time I'm good

[1:36:13] I hope he's going to help someone okay I

[1:36:18] Branham say now when they cross over go
[1:36:22] over the other side he says now you have
[1:36:24] asked ask what you will and he will give
[1:36:27] it to you a perfect top of the Water
[1:36:30] Church all right I want he says I want a
[1:36:33] double portion of your spirit that's
[1:36:35] Elijah Amen brother Branham said don't
[1:36:38] be scared to do whatever ask how
[1:36:40] abundantly you have not because he asked
[1:36:43] now you ask not because you believe no
[1:36:46] that's right ask ask how and hold up God
[1:36:50] will give you up
[1:36:52] a lot of faith a fellow told me the
[1:36:56] other day he says he was riding an old
[1:36:58] water multi fall yet and say one day he
[1:37:02] happened to get some good faith and God
[1:37:04] give him a water Buick he said
[1:37:07] everybody okay and say everybody I got a
[1:37:12] Buick faith I'm praying for water like
[1:37:14] Faith all right that is how good that is
[1:37:17] what why keep on what you believe hold
[1:37:21] on to it God will do it give it he's got
[1:37:24] the food Faith so just stay with the
[1:37:27] father that's all right so let's get a
[1:37:30] little more water faith

[1:37:41] so after church we will be good
[1:37:48] wait
[1:37:50] job
[1:37:52] Chapter 14 verse 1. if you dare you can
[1:37:56] say Amen
[1:37:58] the Bible say a man man
[1:38:01] that is born of a woman is of a few days
[1:38:06] short life
[1:38:08] and it's full of water trouble
[1:38:13] he comes forth like a flower
[1:38:15] and it's cut down he flees also as a
[1:38:19] shadow and continues nothing you might
[1:38:22] be seated
[1:38:23] verse 7.
[1:38:24] for there is a hope of a tree if it be
[1:38:29] cut down that he will do water spoil
[1:38:32] again so job is saying here that if you
[1:38:35] take a tree and you cut it down
[1:38:39] what we call you kill a tree
[1:38:43] job said the tree have a hope
[1:38:47] what is the hope of the tree
[1:38:49] job say that the tree will come up again
[1:38:54] in other words The Cutting of the tree
[1:38:57] is not the end
[1:38:59] the tree has a power in it
[1:39:03] to come back up again to life
[1:39:07] another word the tree has the power of
[1:39:12] Resurrection
[1:39:18] am I reading a different scripture
[1:39:21] let me continue
[1:39:23] for the tree
[1:39:24] for there is a hope of a tree verse 7 if
[1:39:28] it be cut down that it will spread again
[1:39:31] and that the tender Branch thereof will
[1:39:34] not cease
[1:39:36] though they root thereof what's old in
[1:39:39] the earth and the stock thereof die in
[1:39:42] the ground yet through the scent of
[1:39:45] water he will do what but even though
[1:39:48] everything look dead the tree were bad
[1:39:50] again and bring forth both
[1:39:53] like a plant

[1:40:13] you cut a tree he comes back up again
[1:40:16] even if I go and I check the tree and
[1:40:18] it's dried up to the root only take is a
[1:40:21] sense and moisture of water that tree
[1:40:24] will revive again
[1:40:26] but when I see a man dying
[1:40:29] I don't see them returning
[1:40:31] where is what happened to the man

[1:47:55] you will see those clouds again later
[1:47:57] with the horses of brother Branham
[1:47:59] everybody okay to meet the Lord in there
[1:48:03] and so and so shall we ever be with the
[1:48:07] Lord wherefore do what comfort
[1:48:10] one another with this so if you see
[1:48:13] somebody crying Paul says tell him stop
[1:48:15] remember one thing
[1:48:18] you remember the one who died he rose
[1:48:20] again it means everybody that died in
[1:48:23] him must also do water
[1:48:27] reconfirth my brother Bill
[1:48:31] because we're going to see that person
[1:48:32] let's pray Heavenly Father Lord we are
[1:48:36] approaching you humbly again this
[1:48:37] morning Father thanking you for your
[1:48:39] grace your love your mercy and for
[1:48:41] everything you have been doing for us
[1:48:43] father I have done what any man can do
[1:48:46] if you've given him ability to do so now
[1:48:48] he takes the Holy Spirit to unfold your
[1:48:51] word may you move me completely out of
[1:48:53] the way may you come and speak your word
[1:48:55] to your children father in Jesus
[1:48:57] precious name amen
[1:49:00] my subject this morning is the four
[1:49:05] phases of roof
[1:49:07] the resurrection of the Dead
[1:49:10] that's why I say we're in preparation
[1:49:12] for Easter the resurrection of the Dead
[1:49:15] amen we are fully now in roof chapter
[1:49:19] four
[1:49:20] where roof is dealing with the last
[1:49:22] king's men
[1:49:24] because as long as that last Kingsmen
[1:49:27] have power of a roof everybody okay Boaz
[1:49:30] and roof cannot be United in the body
[1:49:33] [Music]
[1:49:35] in order to open the door for a union in
[1:49:38] the body because the Union in the world
[1:49:40] happened after midnight in the threshing
[1:49:43] floor in order to open the door so that
[1:49:46] Boaz can marry roof and have a baby but
[1:49:49] Wars need to make sure that he clear or
[1:49:52] remove completely the first Redeemer
[1:49:55] which brother Branham said was the devil
[1:49:57] completely out of the life of roof
[1:50:00] everybody okay so as we take our data
[1:50:03] and transfer them into the Tabernacle we
[1:50:07] are in the holiest
[1:50:08] in the holiest where roof now is in
[1:50:11] preparation for the going everybody okay
[1:50:14] now last week we established two line we
[1:50:19] established the
[1:50:22] Eternal line
[1:50:23] everybody okay and the temporal line
[1:50:26] everybody okay
[1:50:28] and in internal line we found out that
[1:50:31] we start as a seed
[1:50:32] it's clear now we start as the word and
[1:50:36] we have a body that is also Eternal and
[1:50:39] that body is at your funny we just went
[1:50:41] through that everybody okay in the
[1:50:44] temporal line we are bad we are spirit
[1:50:46] and so everybody clear but we also have
[1:50:50] a natural body which we call the
[1:50:53] Corporal or the flesh or the physical
[1:50:56] body amen and the the song that was sung
[1:51:00] was that come up
[1:51:02] a lot of water because you are low here
[1:51:05] you need to just come up
[1:51:07] when you come up you're gonna beat
[1:51:09] somebody
[1:51:11] everybody okay then we saw that in the
[1:51:14] Redemption of man that when we are born
[1:51:17] according to the wings of brother
[1:51:19] Branham on the east side of us we have a
[1:51:21] seed
[1:51:22] this seed here Eternal is placing us
[1:51:25] amen
[1:51:27] the seed is buried in our soul amen but
[1:51:30] when we are born because of the nature
[1:51:33] of our father brother Branham says and
[1:51:35] the scripture shows us that like in
[1:51:37] Genesis chapter one that all of this is
[1:51:40] filled with Darkness
[1:51:43] everybody okay so when the gospel come
[1:51:46] amen we move from this state into a
[1:51:50] second state where the darkness are
[1:51:53] completely removed amen and we are now
[1:51:56] here with our Darkness everybody clear
[1:51:59] because now the predestinated seed that
[1:52:02] was here is now quickened
[1:52:04] everybody clear brother Branham says
[1:52:07] this in the message certainty then he
[1:52:09] say every seed we bring forth of its
[1:52:12] kind if you are a seed of God an
[1:52:16] attribute we went through this a Son of
[1:52:18] God then the word of God is sown in you
[1:52:22] as a seed
[1:52:24] see and then when you hear the word
[1:52:26] remember it's the word coming to the
[1:52:28] word my sheep hear my voice a stranger
[1:52:32] the world follow you get it then every
[1:52:35] seed come forth after its own everybody
[1:52:38] clears so far brother Branham continues
[1:52:41] again in the message Paradox because we
[1:52:44] found out that as a member of the Bride
[1:52:46] this seed here is a female
[1:52:51] remember that's why I say you keep up
[1:52:53] with the sermon it's an egg and the word
[1:52:57] that is coming to remove the darkness
[1:53:00] because Paul said God who spoke light
[1:53:03] over there in the beginning have also
[1:53:06] shunned the light of the Gospel in our
[1:53:08] heart
[1:53:09] to remove the darkness and to Quicken
[1:53:13] the seed and the word that is coming
[1:53:15] with the light that word is the male
[1:53:19] part
[1:53:20] or the sperm
[1:53:25] everybody okay you cannot unite
[1:53:28] something that is like it that's
[1:53:30] homosexual
[1:53:34] everybody okay everybody okay if we are
[1:53:37] the bread of Jesus Christ we can only be
[1:53:40] United with a male
[1:53:43] everybody okay I don't care how pretty
[1:53:46] our church get how nice we try to dress
[1:53:49] have fun and intellectual we become
[1:53:51] unless we become in contact with the
[1:53:54] mates and the Melt is there and the
[1:53:58] predestinated seed is also there so we
[1:54:01] get the word mate and the female mate
[1:54:04] that join together when they join
[1:54:06] together you are quickened and when you
[1:54:09] are quickened you are born again
[1:54:12] eternal life have come to eternal life
[1:54:14] now you are sons of God
[1:54:18] everybody okay so far glory to God
[1:54:22] my God this is what brother Branham say
[1:54:25] what is the new president
[1:54:28] you say well brother Branham what is the
[1:54:31] new birth it is the water revelation of
[1:54:34] Jesus Christ how personally not
[1:54:37] Collective
[1:54:40] personally to you amen see not you join
[1:54:44] the church you shook him you've done
[1:54:47] something different you said Creed you
[1:54:50] promised to live by a code of rule but
[1:54:52] it's who Christ the water Bible he is
[1:54:55] the one that was revealed and no matter
[1:54:59] what anybody says what takes place is
[1:55:02] who Christ Pastor priest whatever it
[1:55:06] might be it is who Christ and that is
[1:55:09] the Revelation that the church is water
[1:55:11] build upon that's why people are leaving
[1:55:14] this message because they never got a
[1:55:17] personal revelation of the message in
[1:55:21] their life
[1:55:21] [Applause]
[1:55:22] they get an intellectual knowledge
[1:55:26] but the word was never quickened to them
[1:55:30] but he not see it there is nothing to
[1:55:33] Quicken
[1:55:36] everybody okay when this message is
[1:55:39] quick and unto you amen I don't care if
[1:55:42] the pastor leaves the message
[1:55:44] I don't care if Mama leaves the message
[1:55:47] I don't care if your wife leaves the
[1:55:49] message
[1:55:50] nobody can shake you because you are
[1:55:53] born from The Incorruptible
[1:55:56] you are born from another dimension
[1:55:59] you become the sons and daughter of God
[1:56:02] [Applause]
[1:56:09] why are people leaving the message
[1:56:11] they never were born again
[1:56:13] they preach this message yes gift and
[1:56:16] calling are without repentance
[1:56:19] they preach it intellectually
[1:56:22] but they never had the Revelation but if
[1:56:25] you have the Revelation even if you
[1:56:28] don't understand everything
[1:56:30] the revelation will hold on
[1:56:33] no matter what happens something is
[1:56:37] holding me
[1:56:39] every day of my life something is
[1:56:42] holding tight
[1:56:44] that is the new person
[1:56:45] [Applause]
[1:56:55] we confuse people about the new birth
[1:56:58] until we don't know what is the new
[1:57:00] birth
[1:57:01] everybody okay be born again
[1:57:04] don't worry about the cigarette
[1:57:07] that seed has power
[1:57:09] [Applause]
[1:57:12] as it's growing up it will begin to push
[1:57:15] things out
[1:57:17] because it's Jesus Christ when Jesus
[1:57:21] entered in the temple he found people
[1:57:24] selling things
[1:57:26] he pull her up
[1:57:28] Amana Let Jesus be born in you when he
[1:57:33] gets in your house he will pull the Rope
[1:57:36] pornography out
[1:57:38] lying out cheating out everybody out
[1:57:42] throw down the mountain pull down the
[1:57:45] thing because it's the house of my
[1:57:48] husband

[1:57:52] House of Prayer
[1:57:53] it is the temple of God you are the
[1:57:57] temple of God thank you
[1:58:00] Hallelujah
[1:58:02] [Music]
[1:58:05] everybody okay
[1:58:07] everybody okay
[1:58:09] everybody good
[1:58:10] this predestinated here
[1:58:13] is a picky
[1:58:22] the predestinated seed is very picky
[1:58:29] the predestined the seed is so choosy
[1:58:34] it doesn't take anything
[1:58:38] he will write the stuff
[1:58:47] another word nothing can enter there
[1:58:50] except God
[1:58:54] [Applause]
[1:58:56] the Bible says this Brother Sam gave me
[1:58:59] this it slip upon me thank God he said
[1:59:03] Paul Peter says we have a water a more
[1:59:07] water sure World of Water prophecy not
[1:59:10] just a word of Prophecy
[1:59:12] and more sure a Vindicated
[1:59:16] [Applause]
[1:59:23] not a word of Prophecy a more
[1:59:27] word of water prophecy why he says where
[1:59:31] unto you do well
[1:59:33] that he did what he in other way you
[1:59:36] listen to that as unto a light that
[1:59:40] water
[1:59:41] in
[1:59:43] it so the light that is coming
[1:59:46] and sending into your heart must be a
[1:59:50] very short word
[1:59:52] a prophetic word
[1:59:58] everybody okay
[1:59:59] until the water
[2:00:02] the day down you got volume my friend
[2:00:04] and that day star or the Morning Star
[2:00:08] arise in your hearts everybody okay so
[2:00:12] to bring Jesus in your heart not any
[2:00:15] word can bring him out
[2:00:17] [Applause]
[2:00:22] foreign
[2:00:28] that seed is very picky
[2:00:31] [Applause]
[2:00:37] Amen brother Branham say if I taught you
[2:00:40] a metal this message it would do
[2:00:42] whatever it would take no effect on you
[2:00:45] why because it is water bright time the
[2:00:49] seed knows its time
[2:00:50] [Applause]
[2:00:53] everybody okay and not only does he know
[2:00:57] it's time he also know its message in
[2:01:00] other words he recognizes who is the
[2:01:03] husband
[2:01:08] if I taught you Moses if Moses taught
[2:01:12] the message of Noah he would take half
[2:01:15] no effect it's Jesus
[2:01:19] God Moses message he would take water no
[2:01:22] effect why
[2:01:27] why
[2:01:34] because the water we Destiny are laying
[2:01:38] there
[2:01:39] that were on me
[2:01:42] Be Water by that type of water water
[2:01:45] that is good for water that's seed see
[2:01:49] it won't grow and it won't grow any
[2:01:52] other condition it must be the condition
[2:01:55] the water so your predestined the seed
[2:01:59] cannot be awakened by Luther message
[2:02:05] amen it cannot be awakened by
[2:02:07] Pentecostal message
[2:02:09] everybody okay there is something about

[2:04:21] give me the message as pure as it is
[2:04:26] don't take my David and give him the

[2:05:07] that's why we give thanks to the water
[2:05:10] Father which made us water
[2:05:14] fit to be water of the inheritance of
[2:05:18] the water in the water like who did
[2:05:21] water delivered us from water the power
[2:05:24] of darkness and has done
[2:05:27] to the kingdom of Hope
[2:05:30] now we are born again man
[2:05:35] everybody okay
[2:05:37] everybody okay
[2:05:39] damn kind
[2:05:40] that takes the word it's God Waters
[2:05:44] bringing soft water children they can
[2:05:47] die
[2:05:49] a child the bride brings forth on the
[2:05:54] word cannot die
[2:05:56] because it is the word amen did you get
[2:06:00] it she can die because the child can't
[2:06:03] die because he is a word child he's a
[2:06:07] teacher he is a Eternal child Hallelujah
[2:06:11] that is exactly what Jesus was a water
[2:06:15] spoken
[2:06:16] Eternal child didn't have to die but he
[2:06:20] did it in order to pay them that is the
[2:06:23] only way it could be nobody else could
[2:06:25] do it there are there was all bornhaus
[2:06:28] after the water and after the waters but
[2:06:32] God loaded the modem
[2:06:38] everybody okay everybody okay now that
[2:06:42] we are changed here
[2:06:43] from this part one into part two we are
[2:06:47] born again
[2:06:49] everybody okay
[2:06:54] I'm gonna add something
[2:06:56] this Darkness
[2:06:58] is not only on your soul
[2:07:02] part two
[2:07:04] you get the first level now I go to the
[2:07:06] second level
[2:07:07] this darkness is also in your flesh
[2:07:13] because according to Romans 7
[2:07:16] Paul said when I want to do good
[2:07:21] I found that there is water
[2:07:24] you know that right Paul says that I
[2:07:27] noticed that in my flesh
[2:07:29] there is another law
[2:07:31] there is the law of sin and death
[2:07:34] everybody okay in other words even
[2:07:37] though we move From the Inside Man
[2:07:40] the outside man is still under the
[2:07:43] influence of Darkness
[2:07:47] it's the second level I can't give you
[2:07:49] both together I have to give you the
[2:07:51] first when you master the first then I
[2:07:53] add the second
[2:07:55] everybody okay
[2:07:57] brother now we have the water
[2:08:01] Ernest right here our spirit is water
[2:08:03] running for Water full Redemption
[2:08:06] adoption
[2:08:08] everybody okay in other words they
[2:08:10] predestinated seed that is awakened here
[2:08:13] doesn't like what is outside
[2:08:16] [Music]
[2:08:17] everybody okay he's pushing so that the
[2:08:20] devil on your flesh can come out
[2:08:23] because there is still one Kingsman
[2:08:25] Redeemer
[2:08:27] he's on your flesh he's blocking boas
[2:08:31] to unite with you
[2:08:33] so now the second purpose of for us is
[2:08:36] to get the King's Men out of your flesh
[2:08:42] everybody good
[2:08:45] he says but now we have the water
[2:08:47] Earnest as we receive the Holy Spirit it
[2:08:51] is the water Earnest of a complete
[2:08:54] adoption oh complete words salvation oh
[2:08:57] how beautiful I just love that
[2:09:10] Innovation for the Salvation that's
[2:09:12] right fully in its fullness to work come
[2:09:15] but now
[2:09:16] in this Tabernacle of clay we have
[2:09:19] something
[2:09:21] that tell us that we have water
[2:09:25] how so far
[2:09:29] we are not raised completely up
[2:09:32] we are raised suffer we raise to a
[2:09:36] certain level
[2:09:38] in other words the quickening of the
[2:09:42] seed is a resurrection
[2:09:51] everybody okay everybody okay that
[2:09:54] Resurrection is also called the
[2:09:56] quickening
[2:09:59] let's go to Ephesians 2.
[2:10:06] oh God help me
[2:10:09] I'm trying to move my friend
[2:10:17] when the same your first husband died
[2:10:19] it is not your soul that is dying it is
[2:10:22] the darkness that is pushed out
[2:10:25] that darkness is that nature remember
[2:10:27] last Sunday that's the nature that goes
[2:10:30] away but your true nature was in the
[2:10:32] predestinated scene when the Lord Struck
[2:10:35] it the seed is awakened
[2:10:37] now the seed begin to grow
[2:10:40] ah it's going it is removing everything

[2:12:14] I don't know if I'm a Child of God I
[2:12:16] don't know if I'm a Child of God it's
[2:12:18] enough of that
[2:12:19] Ephesians chapter two you there
[2:12:23] you there
[2:12:25] we're talking about the seed
[2:12:27] Resurrection Quicken verse two and verse
[2:12:30] one and you
[2:12:31] has he what quickened to Quicken means
[2:12:34] to make a laugh if they make you alive
[2:12:37] it means you were dead
[2:12:39] amen you okay now he will have quickened
[2:12:43] who were how dead
[2:12:48] amen you will laugh naturally but you
[2:12:51] were dead
[2:12:52] everybody okay so before you reach the
[2:12:55] second Resurrection you must first have
[2:12:58] the first one
[2:13:00] everybody okay everybody okay I'm
[2:13:03] preparing you for Easter he said and you
[2:13:07] has he quickened who were dead in water
[2:13:11] trespassing and water sins wherein in
[2:13:14] tampas you walk according to the course
[2:13:18] of this well according to the priests of
[2:13:22] the power of the water you were doing
[2:13:24] things for the Devil the spirit that now
[2:13:28] works in the water children of water you
[2:13:33] are not a child of disobedience
[2:13:36] because your obedience was already in
[2:13:39] you
[2:13:40] in the predestinedity
[2:13:42] so you can't help but to obey
[2:13:45] but at the beginning they didn't know
[2:13:47] who you are because they put their pants
[2:13:49] down you put your pen down that's why
[2:13:52] God taught brother Branham don't call
[2:13:54] them Ricky rickita because among them
[2:13:57] predestinated seeds are hidden there
[2:14:00] everybody okay
[2:14:02] verse 3 among whom also we had our
[2:14:06] conversation we heard our life among you
[2:14:09] among them that's why you came out today
[2:14:11] never came out your friend's still
[2:14:14] drinking till today
[2:14:15] no matter how much tape you send it to
[2:14:18] him you gave him all kind of message but
[2:14:20] he doesn't come out why do you come out
[2:14:23] he stay
[2:14:24] everybody okay
[2:14:25] in time passed in the last of the flesh
[2:14:29] fulfilling the desire of the Flesh and
[2:14:32] of their mind and whereby
[2:14:35] nature
[2:14:36] which nature the darkness the children
[2:14:40] of water even us others you look at me
[2:14:43] you won't know that's a child of God
[2:14:45] tattoo tattoo
[2:14:48] but underneath that tattoo there is a
[2:14:50] seed
[2:14:51] everybody okay but God
[2:14:55] who is water which rich in Mercy for his
[2:14:59] great love where is wherewith he loved
[2:15:02] us even when we were dead in sin in sin
[2:15:07] he has water Quicken us
[2:15:13] yeah
[2:15:14] he has done water
[2:15:16] when you were dead in sin Christ already
[2:15:19] finish your work that's why Jesus said
[2:15:22] it is
[2:15:26] it's just a matter of time
[2:15:28] he has quickened us how together
[2:15:31] together with grass by what Grace are
[2:15:34] you safe and he has done water where's
[2:15:37] raise us up together and made us sit
[2:15:41] together in Heavenly places in who
[2:15:44] Christ Jesus that in the age to come he
[2:15:48] must show the water exceeding reaches of
[2:15:51] his water Grace in his kindness toward
[2:15:53] us through who Christ Jesus so the
[2:15:56] quickening of the seed is a resurrection
[2:16:01] [Music]
[2:16:02] but you are raised so far to a certain
[2:16:07] level
[2:16:09] there is somebody a sticky nature that
[2:16:11] is still troubling you
[2:16:13] everybody okay what is the earnest it is
[2:16:17] the little down payment that holds
[2:16:19] brother Dutch it is the earnest now once
[2:16:22] we love the things of the world once
[2:16:25] when we sin and went about doing the
[2:16:28] things of the world and care not for God
[2:16:30] we were ndnated from him without god
[2:16:33] without crossing the word God sent his
[2:16:36] word Holy Spirit and through that we are
[2:16:39] whatever lifted out from those things
[2:16:42] now we have half the earnest that we
[2:16:45] know that we have passed from water and
[2:16:48] two there is a new sad resurrection that
[2:16:51] happened
[2:16:54] everybody okay
[2:16:55] now we are waiting for that the second
[2:16:59] Resurrection
[2:17:01] where now do you understand say Amen if
[2:17:04] you do what I mean by saying the earnest
[2:17:07] we know that we have passed from death
[2:17:09] and to life because we are lifted we are
[2:17:13] lift up not in ourselves but lift up
[2:17:15] from the things of the world that we
[2:17:18] love everybody and God loved us and we
[2:17:21] know it and we watch our lives
[2:17:23] and see that it is the holy spirit
[2:17:26] because we don't know more care for the
[2:17:30] fix of the world there you are as long
[2:17:33] as you love the world all the things of
[2:17:35] the world then the love of God is not in
[2:17:37] you yet but as long as you are above
[2:17:40] that
[2:17:41] then you know that you have your
[2:17:44] inheritance you are on your world to
[2:17:47] your water full Redemption so what you
[2:17:50] have by the baptism of the holy spirit
[2:17:53] is a partial Redemption
[2:17:55] [Music]
[2:17:57] you only got 50 percent
[2:18:02] everybody good
[2:18:03] William Marion Branham brother Branham
[2:18:06] say and that is the way it is with every
[2:18:09] Born Again believer you can hear all the
[2:18:12] theology you want to and all the men
[2:18:14] made discrepancy but when that word
[2:18:16] flashes out
[2:18:18] then there is something tackled
[2:18:22] you come to it you were once dead in sin
[2:18:25] that life he has done what there has to
[2:18:29] be a life there in the predestinated
[2:18:32] seed to Quicken to First
[2:18:35] God by his foreign knowledge not all
[2:18:39] things and we were predestinated to be
[2:18:41] Sons and Daughters of God ye who were
[2:18:44] once dead Ephesians 2 in sin and
[2:18:47] trespasses where would we all had our
[2:18:50] time in the past but he has done what
[2:18:53] weakened the first resurrection look at
[2:18:56] Paul when Paul was a great Theologian
[2:18:58] but when he come face to face with that
[2:19:01] word who Jesus
[2:19:04] that word was the pillar of fire it did
[2:19:07] water waking he come he come to life
[2:19:10] right quick because he was how they to
[2:19:15] be that he was part of the word and when
[2:19:19] the word so that word he was his water
[2:19:22] nature
[2:19:24] everybody clear everybody clear
[2:19:27] everybody clear

[2:25:15] watch the board
[2:25:17] the first thing I presented to you was
[2:25:21] the present author
[2:25:25] ity because the president altar was
[2:25:28] Calvary that's why the Christ died and
[2:25:32] the measurement was three by five
[2:25:34] you come by the grace of God to reach
[2:25:37] Perfection five by three that was the
[2:25:40] altar and the sacrifice was killed right
[2:25:43] there and Jesus was killed on Calvary
[2:25:46] that was the first finger presented to
[2:25:48] you when I brought you inside I want you
[2:25:51] to meet the president altar first
[2:25:56] have I lost anyone
[2:25:59] glory to God
[2:26:00] let's go again thank you my brother we
[2:26:03] on verse three so verse 3 open the
[2:26:07] present altar
[2:26:09] in the Tabernacle
[2:26:13] are you there
[2:26:14] number two glory to God
[2:26:17] we're preaching about the resurrection
[2:26:19] of the day amen
[2:26:21] number four verse 4. and that he was how
[2:26:27] and that he rose again the water
[2:26:30] according to the scripture the second
[2:26:33] point that pointed to you
[2:26:36] everybody okay is the barrier
[2:26:41] you following me and the water
[2:26:45] and the resurrection of Jesus Christ
[2:26:50] amen
[2:26:51] where are we in the Tabernacle
[2:26:57] let's go slowly would follow the
[2:27:00] President Hotel is delivered
[2:27:07] amen amen in the letter when you accept
[2:27:12] Jesus Christ
[2:27:13] as your personal savior we take you in
[2:27:17] front of the congregation
[2:27:19] everybody okay and we bury you into the
[2:27:23] water
[2:27:24] do you follow me and we resurrect you
[2:27:27] from the world
[2:27:30] oh
[2:27:31] [Applause]
[2:27:33] everybody good everybody good so the
[2:27:37] baptism is a symbol of the barrier and
[2:27:41] the resurrection of Jesus Christ
[2:27:46] William Marion Branham
[2:27:49] since the symbol of this is assembled
[2:27:52] just like water
[2:27:53] baptism doesn't save you
[2:27:57] baptism is a sign that you are
[2:28:00] witnessing to the congregation that you
[2:28:02] believe in the death and water bear you
[2:28:05] and daughter resurrection of who Jesus
[2:28:07] Christ he doesn't save you water will
[2:28:10] not save you it is your faith that save
[2:28:13] you but baptism is a order it must be
[2:28:16] carried out because God can say to be
[2:28:19] baptized and then turn around and say he
[2:28:22] doesn't need to be done
[2:28:24] everybody okay so the baptism is a
[2:28:28] barrel and a resurrection and what we
[2:28:32] are baptizing in the water is not your
[2:28:34] spirit
[2:28:41] we are not baptizing your soul
[2:28:44] we are baptizing you
[2:28:46] we are preparing your body
[2:28:49] for something
[2:28:55] amen why because the soul and the spirit
[2:28:59] I already dealt with
[2:29:01] [Music]
[2:29:03] in the partial Resurrection
[2:29:07] everybody okay now there is one that is
[2:29:10] staying but let's bury him
[2:29:14] and raise him back again we are telling
[2:29:17] him remember
[2:29:18] remember
[2:29:20] this and this
[2:29:23] remember this and this
[2:29:28] everybody good everybody good
[2:29:31] Paul says this
[2:29:33] in Romans 6 verse 2. keep First
[2:29:37] Corinthians God forbid how shall we that
[2:29:41] are dead to us sin live any longer
[2:29:43] therein know ye not that so many of us
[2:29:49] were baptized into Jesus were baptized
[2:29:54] into his what yes
[2:29:57] we okay
[2:29:59] therefore we were out with him by water
[2:30:02] baptism into death that light class did
[2:30:05] water
[2:30:06] from the dead by the glory of the the
[2:30:09] father even so we should walk in the
[2:30:12] water newness of life because of the
[2:30:14] Resurrection
[2:30:16] you okay
[2:30:17] so if we have been planted together in
[2:30:22] the likeness of his water death by the
[2:30:24] baptism we shall also be water in a
[2:30:28] likeness we shall also we shall be also
[2:30:31] in the likeness is war of water his
[2:30:34] resurrection so when they take you and
[2:30:37] they put you like this what we are
[2:30:39] reminding you that Jesus Christ went
[2:30:42] this way
[2:30:43] but he didn't stay there
[2:30:50] because water is the multitude of the
[2:30:53] people
[2:30:54] everybody okay you went down but you're
[2:30:57] not gonna stay there brother if it
[2:30:59] happened that you go down remember
[2:31:02] you're gonna also
[2:31:06] everybody okay and you want to resurrect
[2:31:09] in his likeness
[2:31:12] [Applause]
[2:31:14] I won't touch his likeness today it's
[2:31:17] for Easter let's continue to progress
[2:31:21] Paul says this he said in colossian bury
[2:31:25] with him in the water baptism wherein
[2:31:28] also yeah
[2:31:29] so the baptism is always connected with
[2:31:34] the resurrection
[2:31:38] [Music]
[2:31:39] in other words deliver hold a mystery of
[2:31:45] Resurrection
[2:31:47] [Music]
[2:31:52] glory to God brother Paul says we're in
[2:31:56] we are also have risen with him through
[2:31:59] what faith of the operation of who God
[2:32:02] who has water raise him from the
[2:32:05] resurrection and you being water dead in
[2:32:08] your sin Ephesians 2 and their
[2:32:11] circumstances are their circumcision of
[2:32:14] your flesh he has done water quickened
[2:32:17] together with him having done water
[2:32:19] forgiven you of all water your
[2:32:21] trespassing so when you are born again
[2:32:23] it means all your sins are gone
[2:32:26] praise God my sins are gone where they
[2:32:30] are and then if the blood which blood
[2:32:36] everybody okay
[2:32:40] glory to God
[2:32:42] let's get this
[2:32:44] first Peter 3 verse 21 the light figure
[2:32:47] we're unto even is water baptism do also
[2:32:51] now how save us it does save us not
[2:32:55] they're putting away of the thief of the
[2:32:58] water flesh but it's water an answer of
[2:33:01] our water because the work is done there
[2:33:04] of a good conscience throughout who God
[2:33:06] by the water resurrection of water Jesus
[2:33:10] if you notice every scripture of baptism
[2:33:12] Paul is always connecting that with the
[2:33:15] resurrection baptize Resurrection
[2:33:18] baptized resurrect barrier Resurrection
[2:33:21] everybody okay everybody good now let's
[2:33:24] go back where we stop verse 4.
[2:33:28] and that he was buried and that he was
[2:33:31] again deliver
[2:33:32] and the third day according to the
[2:33:34] scripture Paul stop there
[2:33:37] Paul never approaches the holiest
[2:33:40] he doesn't go to the holiest but he
[2:33:43] stopped the level
[2:33:44] watch what Paul is bringing out now he
[2:33:47] begin to give testimony
[2:33:49] testimony of what
[2:33:53] verse 5 and that he Jesus Christ was sin
[2:33:57] of who which is Peter then of the water
[2:34:00] well he's saying that what I preached to
[2:34:03] you about Christ dying and resurrecting
[2:34:07] I wanna declare that to you again that
[2:34:10] when we told you that Jesus Christ rose
[2:34:12] again I'm not telling you Fable people
[2:34:15] saw him
[2:34:17] because the Redeemer must be alive
[2:34:20] and I'm gonna tell you who saw him
[2:34:23] Peter saw him
[2:34:25] the 12 saw him
[2:34:27] amen why is Paul insisting
[2:34:31] on proving the resurrection
[2:34:33] what is important in this Resurrection
[2:34:37] we okay
[2:34:39] Paul continue verse 6 after that he was
[2:34:42] sin of above water 500 Brethren at what
[2:34:46] Paul said it's not even Peter and the
[2:34:48] Apostle more than 500 people saw Jesus
[2:34:52] in love after his death
[2:34:55] in other word I want to make sure that
[2:35:00] what I told you about the resurrection
[2:35:01] is sure
[2:35:08] can I continue
[2:35:09] at once of whom the greater part to this
[2:35:13] present some fell some are falling
[2:35:16] asleep after that he was sin of who
[2:35:19] James then of all the water and last of
[2:35:23] all he was sin of who me also as of one
[2:35:28] born out of water Paul is giving all
[2:35:32] this testimony
[2:35:33] to support one thing
[2:35:36] Jesus rose again
[2:35:40] the man that died rose again Peter saw
[2:35:44] him the disciples saw him the apostles
[2:35:47] saw him James saw him more than 500
[2:35:50] people saw him I myself Paul I met Jesus
[2:35:53] Christ
[2:35:55] why is this important
[2:35:58] job to verse 29.
[2:36:02] everybody okay
[2:36:05] you there
[2:36:07] the Bible says this
[2:36:09] he says else what shall they do which
[2:36:14] are baptized for their death if the dead
[2:36:17] rise not at all
[2:36:20] why are you baptized
[2:36:22] if there is no Resurrection
[2:36:25] in other words when we baptizing you
[2:36:28] outside we are telling you there is a
[2:36:31] resurrection
[2:36:32] if there is no Resurrection we won't
[2:36:35] bury you because the fact of doing this
[2:36:38] and doing this is a barrier and a
[2:36:40] resurrection
[2:36:43] everybody good everybody good
[2:36:45] Paul say why are they them baptized for
[2:36:49] their dead that dead is Jesus Christ
[2:36:53] on the board brother Branham say read
[2:36:57] brother never read First Corinthians 15
[2:36:59] verse 29 yes what shall they do if they
[2:37:03] are which are baptized for the dead if
[2:37:04] the dead was not at all why are they
[2:37:07] then baptized for there brother Branham
[2:37:09] say now Brethren there is one people
[2:37:11] that believe that they baptized for the
[2:37:14] dead that is the moment the moment and
[2:37:17] I've been in the temples many times they
[2:37:19] are very fine people and you may be a
[2:37:22] Mormon now I'm not trying to hurt your
[2:37:24] feeling but my dear friend you can't be
[2:37:27] baptized for your father
[2:37:29] that is the act he had to do the way the
[2:37:32] trillions that's the way he fall Paul
[2:37:34] speaking here was talking about their
[2:37:37] dead who Jesus Jesus if the dead was not
[2:37:40] why are you baptized in Jesus Christ's
[2:37:43] name then if it's if the dead was not
[2:37:46] see what I mean let us drink and be
[2:37:49] merry for tomorrow we die if the dead
[2:37:51] was not but he goes ahead and glorify
[2:37:54] God for the water Resurrection after
[2:37:57] death and we are baptized to who Jesus
[2:38:01] dead
[2:38:10] everybody okay
[2:38:12] everybody okay what is the problem with
[2:38:15] Paul why are you coming to the
[2:38:17] correction and preaching to them this
[2:38:19] over again
[2:38:22] what is the important of it what
[2:38:24] happened in the Corinthian Church
[2:38:27] that you have to preach to them the
[2:38:29] resurrection
[2:38:31] you there are you there
[2:38:34] job 2 verse 12. now we go
[2:38:37] if you dare you can say amen amen
[2:38:40] glory to God
[2:38:43] Hallelujah
[2:38:45] Hallelujah
[2:38:46] verse 12. now
[2:38:48] if Christ be preached that he did what
[2:38:52] rose from the dead with all the
[2:38:54] witnesses all the proof that I gave you
[2:38:57] Peter James more than 500 people I saw
[2:39:00] him myself all the apostles all the
[2:39:03] disciples if this is what we preach to
[2:39:05] you amen
[2:39:07] how
[2:39:10] some
[2:39:11] among you
[2:39:13] how say some among you that there is no
[2:39:17] water Resurrection after dead do you see
[2:39:21] why Paul is coming
[2:39:24] everybody okay Paul is saying if I
[2:39:27] preach to you depression hotel and I
[2:39:30] took you all the way to the level and
[2:39:33] show you that Jesus Christ rose again
[2:39:35] and if Jesus was risen and we saw him
[2:39:38] how you people how you folks there are
[2:39:42] some among you
[2:39:44] they are a net filtration in the message
[2:39:49] there are some people that are saying
[2:39:51] that there is no resurrection of the
[2:39:53] Dead
[2:39:54] why is this important
[2:39:57] that Paul must come back again and make
[2:40:00] sure this is refreshed because if you
[2:40:03] don't hold to this Paul said you will
[2:40:06] perish
[2:40:07] what is important about the resurrection
[2:40:09] of the Dead why is it so important
[2:40:13] brother Branham he's doing it today he
[2:40:17] has made a preparation to conserve to
[2:40:19] his own purpose he will conserve a
[2:40:22] church he will conserve a people he will
[2:40:26] conserve who subject for his great water
[2:40:28] that death cannot destroy
[2:40:33] everybody okay
[2:40:34] we realize that it is by faith that we
[2:40:38] believe this but the resurrection
[2:40:42] produces the water solid foundation on
[2:40:46] which hour Faith nothing can destroy it
[2:40:52] the resurrection of the Dead is a solid
[2:40:56] foundation to the Christian faith
[2:41:03] everybody okay everybody okay let's go
[2:41:06] to Hebrew 6.
[2:41:08] I'm going to rush now
[2:41:11] if you can go with me oh God help me

[2:41:38] water from water the present altar
[2:41:43] baptism
[2:41:49] it is the foundation
[2:41:52] and if you notice the baptismal plural
[2:41:58] did you see that there is a baptism that
[2:42:00] we bury you and take you up and there is
[2:42:03] a baptism of the Holy Ghost
[2:42:05] everybody okay Paul is calling that the
[2:42:07] foundation
[2:42:09] everybody okay but the problem is Paul

[2:42:16] there that are saying that there is no
[2:42:18] Resurrection where did these people come
[2:42:21] out

[2:48:03] the god of who Isaac and the god of who
[2:48:06] Jacob God is not the god of the dead but
[2:48:09] of the water leaving what does he mean

[2:48:52] Isaac was not dead Jacob was not dead so
[2:48:55] when God was telling Moses I am the god
[2:48:58] of Abraham I am the god of Isaac I am
[2:49:01] the god of Jacob God was not talking
[2:49:04] about the dead Abraham
[2:49:07] he was not talking about the dead Jacob
[2:49:10] another word Abraham Isaac and Jacob I
[2:49:14] love that's why the Rich Young Ruler
[2:49:17] when he went to hell he could see
[2:49:20] Abraham and talk to Abraham
[2:49:25] everybody okay
[2:49:26] how can the sadducee preach that there
[2:49:30] is no Resurrection
[2:49:32] let me nail this let's go to Acts
[2:49:35] chapter 23.
[2:49:37] then we rush quickly
[2:49:39] because I can't get to you to the
[2:49:42] Pharisee because I would have showed you
[2:49:44] what the Pharisee brought in the message
[2:49:47] there is the bringing of the Pharisee
[2:49:49] and the bringing of the Sadducees both
[2:49:51] in a message
[2:49:52] are you there

[2:49:57] dare you can say Amen verse 6
[2:50:00] amen
[2:50:01] but when Paul perceived that one part
[2:50:05] why water and the other was what
[2:50:08] Pharisees he cried out in the council
[2:50:10] man and Brethren I am a Pharisee the son
[2:50:14] of a Pharisee of the hope and the water
[2:50:17] resurrection of the Dead I am calling
[2:50:20] what a question and when he had said so
[2:50:22] there was a water
[2:50:24] separation started again the fight
[2:50:26] started a message
[2:50:29] amen between the Pharisee and the
[2:50:32] services and the multitude was what
[2:50:34] divided when they want to crucified the
[2:50:37] word made flesh in power they come
[2:50:40] together
[2:50:42] but yet they are enemies
[2:50:45] everybody okay watch verse 8 for the sad
[2:50:49] you see say there is water no
[2:50:51] Resurrection neither Angels no Spirit
[2:50:54] but the Pharisee Confessor both so
[2:50:57] Sadducees remove the supernatural from
[2:51:01] the church
[2:51:03] and we got Mercy churches that are dead
[2:51:09] they don't believe in the Supernatural
[2:51:12] at all
[2:51:19] everybody okay everybody okay everybody
[2:51:23] good
[2:51:26] we got Mr churches cold
[2:51:33] how can the sadducee follow the law of
[2:51:37] Moses and do not believe in the
[2:51:39] resurrection
[2:51:41] Elijah Rose a boy
[2:51:44] that was dead
[2:51:46] the child of the will of serifah
[2:51:49] and Russia came and another boy died and
[2:51:53] was resurrected and a man that they were
[2:51:57] going to bury in the scripture everybody
[2:51:59] okay hit the bones of Elijah and
[2:52:02] resurrected Moses Resurrected
[2:52:06] Jesus was Lazarus
[2:52:09] Jesus rose the winner the daughter of
[2:52:12] jerias Jesus rose the son of the will of
[2:52:16] men how can after all this Resurrection
[2:52:20] in the Old Testament among the believer
[2:52:23] somebody doesn't believe in Resurrection
[2:52:30] everybody okay everybody okay what is
[2:52:33] important about the resurrection
[2:52:38] what is important let's go to First
[2:52:40] Corinthians 15 and we finish
[2:52:43] what is important about the resurrection
[2:52:46] if you dare we can say Amen I'm skipping
[2:52:48] a lot
[2:52:49] job to verse 21.
[2:52:52] verse 13.
[2:52:55] you there
[2:52:57] the question is there verse 13 let's
[2:52:58] finish
[2:52:59] but if there be no water
[2:53:02] of the dead then is cross water now
[2:53:05] reason and if Christ be not risen damn
[2:53:08] is our preaching house and your faith
[2:53:11] also is whatever you cannot preach this
[2:53:14] gospel without the resurrection of Jesus
[2:53:16] Christ
[2:53:17] [Applause]
[2:53:21] everybody okay everybody okay let me
[2:53:24] drop down again we are on Versa uh verse
[2:53:28] 15. yeah and we are found how false
[2:53:31] Witnesses of God because we have testify
[2:53:34] of God that he raised up class whom he
[2:53:36] raised up if so be that the dead Rises
[2:53:42] for if the dead rest water not then is
[2:53:46] not glass Water waste watch carefully
[2:53:48] and if grass be not raised your faith is
[2:53:53] what vain you are yet in your sins in
[2:53:57] other words without the
[2:53:59] resurrection there is no quickening of
[2:54:03] the seed
[2:54:04] [Applause]
[2:54:07] because what save you what could save
[2:54:11] you what delivered you from your sin was
[2:54:14] the power of the Resurrection
[2:54:17] if the resurrection is not there you
[2:54:20] cannot Quicken the seed
[2:54:22] [Applause]
[2:54:24] let me explain it again in other words
[2:54:27] without the power of Resurrection there
[2:54:31] is no new breath
[2:54:35] [Music]
[2:54:36] amen
[2:54:43] sorry
[2:54:46] let me go to uh go to First Peter 1. so
[2:54:51] I make my points lay in the scripture
[2:54:53] glory to God
[2:54:57] First Peter chapter one
[2:55:00] first Peter
[2:55:01] chapter one oh God help me
[2:55:06] you there
[2:55:08] First Peter chapter one job to verse 3
[2:55:11] if you did
[2:55:13] I just made a statement verse three

[2:55:18] Lord who Jesus Christ which according to
[2:55:20] His abundant Mercy has water begotten us

[2:55:28] eyes again to her Lively Hope by the
[2:55:33] water resurrection of Jesus from there
[2:55:36] so the best the new person is coming
[2:55:40] from the power of Resurrection
[2:55:44] if no Resurrection no new birth and if
[2:55:48] New Birth is there he means we will have
[2:55:51] the change of the body
