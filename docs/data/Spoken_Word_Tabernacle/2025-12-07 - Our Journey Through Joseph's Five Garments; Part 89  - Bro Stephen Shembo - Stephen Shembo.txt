So, brother brother um Angelo sent me this. She says, "I have a prayer request for a lady that he met." This was on Tuesday. Uh she was short on her rent, which she was due which was due on Tuesday. Uh she was doing Uber Eats, trying to make a little money, you know, make up the rest of the money for the rent. Brother Angelo said he gave her everything he had on him at the time, but it wasn't enough to cover what she needed. He didn't catch her name, but he said, "Let's pray that God provides everything she needs and reveals himself to her in an undeniable way." Amen. Praise God. &gt;&gt; And uh I also have have one as well. I don't know. I think I've mentioned a friend of mine that was in Desert Storm with me. He's developed um pancreatic cancer and uh I haven't had an opportunity yet. Every time we try to plan to go down there, it's a it's not a good day. So, you know, we respect that. But um he sent me a text yesterday and just thanked me for the love that I've shown him, you know, through text and stuff and and uh and I reexpressed that and and explained to him that I, you know, he knew he knew back then that um we were trying to begin to start serving the Lord according to this message. And and I told him, I said, you know, brother, I still believe in a God with divine healing, divine intercession and divine healing. I'm kind of getting the feeling from his text, just the fact that he sent it out that he's given up. He's accepting that he's not going to make it. His name is Fred Harris. He lives down in Elgen, South Carolina. And uh it's just been on my heart since I learned of his diagnosis. Um you know, you develop bonds. They're not always good as far as some of the relationship, but um you know, we serve together in in in Desert Storm and um you do form a bond regardless. And I just I just got a burden for him in my heart and I just want to share it with y'all that y'all can help me pray for him. Amen. So, I'm going to ask um I'm going to ask brother Michael Omach to come up and uh pray over these things. and he told me his family is doing fine as well. So, we want to thank the Lord for that. Let's let's stand and let's also listen. God [music] came down in a mighty way Wednesday. We want that every service. I mean, there's no reason why we should expect any less when we meet.

Exactly right. &gt;&gt; Until brother Brandham and then she came, she corrected. She say, "You know what? I will begin to travel with my husband if he's a preacher." &gt;&gt; That's exactly. &gt;&gt; Do you see what I'm saying? Because you need to balance things together. &gt;&gt; Amen. As a minister, as a pastor, I'm going in the different wavelength. But sometime you got to remember you got people that are not in the same wavelength with you. So sometime you got to drop a little bit and fellowship together and then you come back up again and you continue to sow. So now when I'm soaring they happy over there.

[applause] &gt;&gt; You didn't get me well. We are still in this flesh. &gt;&gt; So you need to be mindful of the spirit and also the flesh. So there is a time to talk about the word and there is a time to eat food. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There's a time to put the Bible aside and to bring food. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And to eat food. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You got to balance the two together. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So they were happy enjoying over there. And sometime I sleep up and sit down and uh go with my reading and my Bible and everything. So by God's grace, all is going well and everything went well by God's grace. There's a couple that are part of the invisible audience. They live there. They bought a house. I know how to suffer for getting a house by God's grace and God open up. It's a season. They jump in the water and in a miraculous way, God gave them a a beautiful house. &gt;&gt; And uh and I already planned my operation a long time ago. I was studying Florida, studying the map and everything and and so before I get there, I was already in Florida. So by God's grace, when I got there, I didn't tell them anything. &gt;&gt; Uh I just gave some signal, but they were not uh uh perceiving the the the signal. So I have to drop on my operation. My wife didn't even know about the trip. My family didn't know. I just told them maybe two or three days. I say, "Pack, we going &gt;&gt; are we going alone?" I said, "No, I'm I'm going with you." So, everything worked out pretty good. We got there. I got there. I called the brother and he was on the phone. I say, "Somebody's ringing at the door." He says, "Really?" I say, "Yes, go check it." He comes out. He looked, he said, "Pastor Steven." [laughter] Amen. Wow. The wife was at work and she felt like, "What is God?" Brother Steven is here. So it was I say I didn't want to say anything before somebody called me to preach somewhere and say go preach over there. I didn't go to preach. I went to just take a break and then uh begin to to move on. That's why I did it that way. So but God grace everything went I say I came to dedicate your house &gt;&gt; and they were not ready. So they say pastor you need to come back and everything. So by waiting to come back what they did they begin to call people that are not in the message. Amen. Amen. That's it right there, brother. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; And the total was 28 people. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; That's good enough, right? We can start preaching. &gt;&gt; 28. Oh, it's good enough. So, we stop right here. &gt;&gt; Oh, okay. So, 28 people were invited. So, I got there and I say, "Okay, I'm coming. I'm going to pray for your house and move on and go." The brother sat down. He said, "Brother Steven, no, no, no, no, no, no. Please, pastor, you need to go. We invited a lot of people. You need to say something." I said, "Oh my God." &gt;&gt; I said, "I didn't prepare for this." He said, "No, no, no, no. Pastor, please go. Come at 9 when everybody's coming. You need to preach a little something." &gt;&gt; And among all of them, if I'm not mistaken, only two were message believer. And there was even a Pentecostal preacher right there. &gt;&gt; So I sat down. I say, "Okay, we going home." &gt;&gt; And I say, "Here I come. I'm now put on a preaching right here." &gt;&gt; I begin to go home. When I begin to focus and meditate, a whole brand new sermon broke. &gt;&gt; Why do we dedicate a home? &gt;&gt; I never even know that sermon. I don't even know what it is. I got in the hotel, a scripture came. A scripture, a scripture, a scripture. Before you know it, a whole sermon. I need to preach to Somebody need to buy a house so I can preach. [laughter] [cheering] &gt;&gt; I know I got to dedicate few more houses here. Sister Miriam, there is two more brother. I' never been brother Chris and there is brother Dina. I went to his home. I've dedicated. He bought another house. So I already it's brother Chris's sister and there is another one that I need to dedicate the home. So I'm I'm going to work with you. I don't know. I was just going for vacation. He turned up for something. But brother a whole sermon open. Even a quote came up. &gt;&gt; I can take that same sermon and even preach to you the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Why do you dedicate a house? Why do we call a preacher to dedicate a home? &gt;&gt; So there were people pulling. So by God's grace, I'm going to ask the brother because he recorded to take the sermon so we would load it on YouTube. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother, I got there. I got back. I look a lot of people that were there and it turned to a service. The presence of the Lord came down. You should hear in Pentecost people that are not in the message how they praying. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the word soaking. I don't I won't say anything. Just call the brothers and ask them what is even the preacher that was there was looking for my number. They gave him the the YouTube channel here. He's a Pentecostal preacher. &gt;&gt; Amen. They told him about the ant. He went to his own church and preached the mystery. Preach the ant. The church was on fire. &gt;&gt; Yes, SIR. [applause] [cheering] &gt;&gt; The people of his church are asking him, "Where are you getting this revelation?" Come on. [laughter] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The Lord came down. It was such a blessing in a supernatural way. Amen. And there was a family that came here one time from Florida. They part of the invisible audience. They in Miami. And they used to stream. And one day they went all the way they came. I believe it was the wife uh uh birthday or something like that. So the husband took her all the way from Florida to here just to make sure we get it. But by God's grace when they told me to go the first time I look and I called sister Jerusha. It was probably a month when we spoke. She didn't know that I was coming there. So I I sent some drone and she didn't understand what I was saying until I told her. I said, "You remember me talking to you that day?" And guess what? I got on the road and I went I traveled two hours all the way to see sister Jerus. &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; I got there. I saw brother Robert over there. [laughter] [applause] &gt;&gt; Now we turn into another fellowship with brother Robert and sister and sister Adasa. So we spent time two hours again drove all the way back to Orlando. So there was a family that came here one time and as we were going there I told my wife I say would you check that family because I was trying to see where they are uh compared to the place that we were staying.

GOD IS [screaming] ALIVE. &gt;&gt; THE HOLY SPIRIT IS ALIVE. THAT'S THE SAME GOD THAT BROUGHT YOU TO THIS MESSAGE. [cheering] &gt;&gt; Are we together? LET'S GIVE JESUS A BIG CLAP OFFERING. [applause and cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; Everybody happy? So brother, you can discuss with sister and get the YouTube and loaded and we go there and we move on. Good to see you daughter. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Welcome again. [applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. Everything clear so far? &gt;&gt; We happy now? &gt;&gt; So all of this is called zero minute. Zero, &gt;&gt; right, brother Mickey? It's called zero minute. Are we together? &gt;&gt; We clear. &gt;&gt; So now let's go to the reading of the word. &gt;&gt; Flight attendant, prepare for takeoff. &gt;&gt; Ah, spoken word tabernacle. It has been a long time since we seen each other on Wednesday on Sunday. &gt;&gt; Amen. [laughter] &gt;&gt; It feels like eternity. Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Oh my. What I was supposed we stopped somewhere couple weeks ago and we were supposed to pick up where we stop and get in your life. But what was supposed to be preached here today has been moved to probably next Sunday because in Florida in Orlando things were coming up. [laughter] &gt;&gt; So I had to take note quickly in Orlando. And I tried to use that and move forward but I could not. It keep opening up. It keep opening up. So we will today's sermon is move to next Sunday and today it's something different. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So you will stay alert &gt;&gt; and focus &gt;&gt; Yeshua you need to stay really really focused &gt;&gt; because it's a different route. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So let's pray. Heavenly father Lord we are approaching you humbly this morning. Father, thanking you for your grace, your love, your mercy, for everything you're doing in this church and all over the world for your children. The glory is not unto a man. The glory is unto you, the Lord Jesus, because you deserve it and you have been so good to us. To see the miracle and the things that you're doing in the lives of the people beyond these four walls, Father, &gt;&gt; it is amazing and it's mindblowing. But it's your grace and we will see more unfolding Lord. Father as the time Lord Jesus Christ permit until you come. Father this is as far as I can go with the ability you have given me Lord when it comes to speaking to your children. Lord we pray that you come down and move me and the audience completely away. May you touch baby Tony and heal him completely Lord Father by the power of the Holy Spirit. And Lord, come and speak to our soul and seal every demonic spirit away from this place, Lord, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's go to Exodus 34. &gt;&gt; You see where we we are? We are in Exodus 34. [clears throat] If we would preach what we can preach. My theme. Let me give you the title. Oh, glory to God. My title is our life journey through Joseph's five garment part 89. &gt;&gt; Ah, spoken word. Amen. &gt;&gt; We are still on the second garment [laughter] and we are on part 89. I don't know when we going to get into the fifth garment. &gt;&gt; [laughter] &gt;&gt; Which part are we going to be? Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; My theme, if we can get it, is a mysterious. Remember what was supposed to be preached today has been pushed. A mysterious season. A mysterious season in the parable of the 10 pounds. &gt;&gt; You're going to learn that parable if you don't read your Bible. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Do you know the parable of the 10 pounds? You know the talent &gt;&gt; but today you will learn about the pound. &gt;&gt; In another scripture they call that the miners. &gt;&gt; You will see it's written in other translation they call that the either manas or minas or whatever it's the same thing. But the King James version use pounds. Are we together? &gt;&gt; So please stay really focused. If I see you lingering, I would push the brake because these are material you need to stay focused. We clear &gt;&gt; Genesis Exodus 34. If you dare, you can say amen. &gt;&gt; You see, we're in Genesis, but we are going to talk about the parable over there. So, we got to blend Genesis and the New Testament. We clear? &gt;&gt; Verse one. And the Lord said to Moses, "You," in other word, cut out, &gt;&gt; in other word, go chop &gt;&gt; Moses, you can be seated so we can begin to so help me move with the the reading. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; In other words, Moses have to do some work, &gt;&gt; right? [laughter] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In other word, Moses have to get a tool. Maybe a shop tool. Stay very spiritual. Keep your seat belt. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Moses have to get a shop tool. &gt;&gt; We touch up on this in the hotel. Moses have to get a sharp tool &gt;&gt; and go and begin to cut. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To cut a rock. &gt;&gt; Okay, let's read it. The Bible say, "And the Lord said to Moses, &gt;&gt; you you in other words, cut out &gt;&gt; water, two tables of water, &gt;&gt; stone." &gt;&gt; So those table must be in a stone. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's correct. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Those table must be in a rock. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Or maybe in a in a rock or in a mountain. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Somewhere. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the stone are inside there. &gt;&gt; Just like the the image of Michelangelo, &gt;&gt; the stone are inside there. &gt;&gt; So Moses the prophetes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Have to get a tool. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And a sharp tool. &gt;&gt; Because and and go to the mountain. &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. And when he get to the mountain, HE NEED TO START CUTTING the stone &gt;&gt; because Moses needed a piece of stone, two pieces, the table &gt;&gt; to pull them from the mountain. &gt;&gt; So it's a prophet with a tool &gt;&gt; toward the mountain. &gt;&gt; And some are still warming the engine. &gt;&gt; Let me start it again [laughter] because I can't I can't let you go. There is a prophet, a major prophet. &gt;&gt; By the name of Moses, &gt;&gt; a prophet that God talked to him face to face. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Without any parable. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; BECAUSE GOD SAY WITH a prophet I speak different &gt;&gt; but with Moses I SPEAK TO HIM FACE to face. &gt;&gt; So Moses was a special prophet. And even Jesus Christ have to come in the magnitude of Moses &gt;&gt; because Moses said the Lord your God will send you a prophet like unto me. &gt;&gt; Jesus have to come at the magnitude of Moses. &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we clear? &gt;&gt; Amen. So God told that prophet, he said, "GO TO A MOUNTAIN." &gt;&gt; And take a sharp tool. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And go and cut. &gt;&gt; So the PROPHET WILL PICK UP A SHARP tool &gt;&gt; and cut the mountain. &gt;&gt; We are together. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; WHEN HE CUT, HE PULL a piece off the mountain. &gt;&gt; BUT NOTHING IS WRITTEN ON THAT PIECE. Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; I'M ALREADY IN THE VISION OF JUNIOR JACKSON. &gt;&gt; I'M ALREADY IN THE VISION OF GINA JACKSON. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE JUNIOR JACKSON, BROTHER, BROTHER WAS STANDING BY A MOUNTAIN AND A CROWBAR, SOMETHING LIKE A CROWBAR CAME. BUT WHEN THE INTERPRETATION CAME, he was not a crowbar. He was THE SWORD OF THE king &gt;&gt; and HE WAS THE SWORD THAT HE CHOPPED THE MOUNTAIN. AND WHEN HE CHOPPED THE MOUNTAIN, A PIECE CAME OUT. BUT NOTHING WAS WRITTEN IN THAT PIECE. &gt;&gt; But the WORD MUST BE INTERPRETED BY FROM THE UNWRITTEN PIECE. &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? Help me leave the airport, my friend. &gt;&gt; Have I lost you? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Have I lost you? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. It's not powerful. &gt;&gt; Moses &gt;&gt; get in the mountain &gt;&gt; with a sharp tool cut up the m the stone. When he come up with the stone, if you notice the stone doesn't have any writing. &gt;&gt; So Moses have to take the stone. &gt;&gt; That's correct. &gt;&gt; And go with that in the mountain &gt;&gt; to get the interpretation &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; of the unwritten stone right there. That is my brother. &gt;&gt; YES SIR. &gt;&gt; BROTHER BRHAM CUT OUT THE MOUNTAIN, OPEN UP AND SAW A STONE WITH NO WRITING AND BROTHER BRANDHAM HAVE TO GO TO SUNSET MOUNTAIN TO GET THE INTERPRETATION OF THEIR WRITTEN WORD. &gt;&gt; I HOPE we are together. Some of you are not synchronizing. We need to send more energy. Amen. [laughter] Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So when you see Moses going to the mountain, you say, "What is this?" He say stone. What is written on it? Nothing. &gt;&gt; Nothing. &gt;&gt; But those stone got scripture. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So Moses has to go to the mountain for God to write &gt;&gt; to interpret &gt;&gt; the scripture. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. Uh if you slow I won't finish this to get to the parable. &gt;&gt; Are we clear? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The Bible say and the Lord said to Moses, you you out you uh you you two tables of stone like to the water. &gt;&gt; The first &gt;&gt; So there were two tables of stone. The first one was broken and destroyed. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And remember the first one was already written. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But the second one have have the unwritten part. &gt;&gt; Remember the pyramid of Junior Japson. The first part was written. Amen. &gt;&gt; The mountain of Junior Jackson have riding all around &gt;&gt; but on the top there was a part where brother Brandham cut it was the unwritten one. &gt;&gt; And Moses have two tables of law. &gt;&gt; The first one was already written but the second one he's taking to the mountain have no writings. &gt;&gt; This message is perfectly in line with the Bible. &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. &gt;&gt; Amen. [laughter] &gt;&gt; Do you read your message? &gt;&gt; Amen. go in the message, sir, is this the time of the end time or something like that. Oh, sir, what time is it? Go listen to that sermon. &gt;&gt; Can I continue? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If you have a hard time swallowing this, what is coming up might be too strong. &gt;&gt; Okay, we clear. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We clear? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And mo and God say like unto the first, and I will do what? &gt;&gt; Write upon the stone. &gt;&gt; So, who's going to write on the stone? &gt;&gt; God. &gt;&gt; Remember who's going to write on the stone? &gt;&gt; God. So God is the one doing the writing. [music] &gt;&gt; God will write on the stone. Moses bring the stone and God is supposed to write. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Please, you can't sleep. It's the devil. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; H. You need to get this stuff right here. Let him use &gt;&gt; I I don't have any choice. I got to drop this. &gt;&gt; On Wednesday, we had a wonderful service &gt;&gt; this Wednesday. Amen. &gt;&gt; And the Holy Spirit came down &gt;&gt; and some of you received the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; On Wednesday, &gt;&gt; are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? The Lord opened up a door to outpour the Holy Ghost on someone. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; And it was a wonderful service. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Because brother Tony was used by God to come straight with a sermon that is called receive ye the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Are we together? It was a special grace by God that brought the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; But I WANT YOU TO BE VERY CAREFUL. &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit doesn't come only with a sermon that is called Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? BECAUSE MESSAGE BELIEVER are used TO TRADITION. &gt;&gt; They were here. We have to preach what is the Holy Ghost. What was the HOLY GHOST GIVEN FOR? HOW DO YOU RECEIVE IT? And we need TO MAKE A LONG PRAYER LINE TO LAY HAND ON THE PEOPLE TO RECEIVE THE HOLY GHOST. &gt;&gt; BUT GOD CAME ON THE WEDNESDAY AND BROUGHT THE HOLY GHOST. &gt;&gt; THE HOLY GHOST IS ALWAYS AVAILABLE IN EVERY SERMON. [cheering and applause] &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? ARE WE TOGETHER? THE BIBLE SAYS THIS. I WAS TALKING TO MY WIFE ABOUT THIS. THE BIBLE SAYS in the book of John chapter 6 verse 63, he say it is the what? &gt;&gt; Spirit &gt;&gt; that does what? &gt;&gt; That quickenth. &gt;&gt; The flesh does what? &gt;&gt; Profereth nothing. &gt;&gt; THE WORDS THAT I SPEAK UNTO YOU, &gt;&gt; not the written word. &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. NOT THE WRITTEN WORD. &gt;&gt; You didn't get me well. YOU TRADITIONALIST &gt;&gt; NOT THE WRITTEN WORD. &gt;&gt; THE LETTER &gt;&gt; NOT THE WORD THAT IS WRITTEN BUT THE WORD THAT I SPEAK TO YOU THE SPOKEN WORD &gt;&gt; THE SERMON THE PREACHING THE TEACHING. WHEN A MINISTER IS PREACHING, WHEN A MINISTER IS ANOINTED AND HE BEGIN TO PREACH THE WORD THAT IS COMING UP OUT OF THE PASTOR BECAUSE IT'S NO LONGER THE PASTOR, IT IS GOD THAT HAVE TAKEN OVER THE VESSEL. WHEN THE WORD IS COMING OUT, &gt;&gt; THOSE WORD [screaming] THEY ARE WHAT? &gt;&gt; SPIRIT. THE WORD THAT I SPEAK TO YOU, THEY ARE WHAT? &gt;&gt; SPIRIT. &gt;&gt; SO THE SON HAVE THE HOLY GHOST. &gt;&gt; I HOPE WE ARE TOGETHER. [cheering] &gt;&gt; I HOPE WE ARE TOGETHER. &gt;&gt; THE WORD THAT I SPEAK TO YOU ARE WHAT? &gt;&gt; SPIRIT &gt;&gt; AND WHAT? &gt;&gt; LIFE. &gt;&gt; SO WHERE IS THE SPIRIT AND THE LIFE? &gt;&gt; SO WHEN THE WORD IS COMING, &gt;&gt; THE HOLY GHOST IS THERE. &gt;&gt; [cheering] &gt;&gt; I HOPE WE are together. &gt;&gt; IN OTHER WORDS, WHEN YOU ARE RECEIVING THE WORD, YOU ARE RECEIVING THE HOLY GHOST. &gt;&gt; YOU ARE RECEIVING GOD. [screaming and cheering] &gt;&gt; WHEN THE HOLY GHOST IS COMING IN THE ANOINTED WORD OF THE HOUR, WHEN YOU RECEIVE THE HOLY GHOST, YOU RECEIVE THE MESSAGE. YOU RECEIVE THE WORD THAT HAS BEEN SPOKEN. THAT WORD GOT THE SPIRIT OF GOD AND HE GOT THE LIFE OF GOD INSIDE. [cheering] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. I'M RAISING YOU UP ABOVE PENTECOSTAL. &gt;&gt; I'M RAISING YOU UP ABOVE LAYING ON HAND. &gt;&gt; WHEN THE WORD IS BEEN PREACHED, YOU DON'T HAVE TO WAIT AT THE END &gt;&gt; TO PRAY FOR THE HOLY GHOST. WHEN GOD IS SPEAKING ABOUT THE HOLY GHOST THROUGH BROTHER TONY, ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS STAND UP &gt;&gt; AND SAY, "LORD, I RECEIVE IT." [applause] &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; THIS IS BEYOND SUCCESSION. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. AND IT'S IMPORTANT FOR YOU TO RECEIVE THE WORD THAT WAY &gt;&gt; BECAUSE SENSATION MAY OR MAY NOT BE. &gt;&gt; AND THE DEVIL WILL CONTINUE TO PLAY AROUND UPON YOUR FEELING. I DON'T FEEL GOD TODAY. I FEEL ANOINTED. I DON'T FEEL ANOINTED. WE DON'T WANT THAT. &gt;&gt; WHETHER I FEEL GOD OR NOT, I KNOW GOD IS IN ME. &gt;&gt; I KNOW GOD IS IN MY LIFE. I CAN WALK WITH GOD. I KNOW HIM. [applause] [cheering] &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? OH, I FEEL GOOSEBUMP. WHAT ABOUT IF YOU didn't feel GOOSEBUMP NOW? YOU STUCK AND THE DEVIL WOULD TELL YOU YOU DON'T HAVE IT. DEVIL, IT'S NOT IN MY FLESH. &gt;&gt; THAT IS THE FIRST POOL. &gt;&gt; IT IS NOT IN MY SPIRIT. THAT'S THE SECOND POOL. IT IS SOMETHING WAY BEYOND IN MY SOUL &gt;&gt; THAT AGREE WITH THE WORD OF GOD [cheering] FOR MY TIME. [screaming] &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; I'M LEAVING THE AIRPORT, MY FRIEND. KEEP YOUR SEAT BELT. THE AIRPLANE IS GOING ON LIKE THIS. [cheering] WHENEVER WE PREACHING THE WORD, YOU ARE AVAIL. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham say the message of the seven angel came to deliver us from the tradition of the world. &gt;&gt; And which traditional &gt;&gt; and Pentecostal tradition &gt;&gt; receive the Holy Ghost. Receive the Holy Ghost and they push you even they push you and then you fell and then you didn't feel anything &gt;&gt; because you have another expectation. You have a wrong interpretation. &gt;&gt; Who lay hand on who on the day of Pentecost? &gt;&gt; ANSWER MY QUESTION. WHO LAY HAND ON WHO? On the day of Pentecost, who was laying hand ON PEOPLE? THEY WERE ALL SITTING AND THE HOLY GHOST CAME. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? &gt;&gt; AMEN. WHO LAY HAND ON THE DAY OF PENTECOST BECAUSE JESUS PHYSICAL WAS NOT THERE. &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY BROTHER BRANDHAM SAY ONE DAY IT WON'T BE THE LAYING ON HAND OF THE PEOPLE. IT WILL BE THE HOLY GHOST HIMSELF &gt;&gt; WILL LAY HAND ON YOU &gt;&gt; I have a question. &gt;&gt; I have a question. IF A MINISTER PRAY for you &gt;&gt; to receive the Holy Ghost &gt;&gt; and you believe you receive the Holy Ghost &gt;&gt; and that minister backs lead from the message. &gt;&gt; ARE YOU GOING TO ACCEPT YOUR HOLY GHOST OR NOT? &gt;&gt; I DON'T PLAY GAME. I'M USING A DIFFERENT BAZOOKA NOW. &gt;&gt; ARE YOU GOING TO BELIEVE DID YOU RECEIVE THE HOLY GHOST OR NOT? &gt;&gt; IN OTHER WORD PREACHER, GET THE PREACHER OUT. I HOPE YOU UNDERSTANDING ME. &gt;&gt; PREACHER SO AND SO PRAY FOR MY HOLY GHOST. NOW THE PREACHER LEFT THE MESSAGE. NOW DID YOU RECEIVE THE HOLY GHOST OR NOT? IT IS NOT THE EVIDENCE OF A PREACHER. LET'S GO BACK TO THE WORD. &gt;&gt; LET'S GO BACK TO THE [cheering] WORD. &gt;&gt; WHEN THE WORD [screaming] IS COMING AND I RECEIVE THE WORD, &gt;&gt; I DON'T CARE ABOUT THE PREACHER. I'M CARING ABOUT THE WORD. HEAVEN AND EARTH WILL PASS AWAY, BUT MY WORD WILL REMAIN FOREVER. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; IF THE PREACHER WHO PRAYED for you, you see him in weaknesses. &gt;&gt; So what are you going to do? &gt;&gt; Ah, he prayed for me. But look at what he did. Did I GOT THE HOLY GHOST OR NOT? THE TIME HAS COME TO GET THAT ALL OUT OF THE WAY. I DIDN'T GET THE HOLY GHOST FROM HIM. I GOT THE HOLY GHOST FROM THE WORD. [applause] &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AND JESUS SAID, "THE WORD THAT I SPEAK TO YOU, &gt;&gt; THE WORD THAT I'M SPEAKING," IN OTHER WORDS, WHEN JESUS IS SPEAKING, THERE IS A SPIRIT AND LIFE &gt;&gt; IN THAT WORD. [screaming] &gt;&gt; IT IS NOT THE WRITTEN WORD. [screaming] IT IS THE LOG GHOST, &gt;&gt; THE ANOINTED WORD, [cheering] THE PILLAR OF FIRE, &gt;&gt; THE WORD THAT IS LIVING AND ABIDE THERE FOREVER. [applause] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; THAT is the reason why in the book of act chapter what? &gt;&gt; 10 &gt;&gt; verse what? &gt;&gt; 44. &gt;&gt; When Peter was in the house of who? &gt;&gt; Cornelius. &gt;&gt; A Jews or a gentile? &gt;&gt; A gentile. &gt;&gt; Who are you? Are you Jew OR GENTILE? GENTILE, &gt;&gt; WHEN ARE YOU GOING TO BE ON YOUR GENTILE SIDE? &gt;&gt; You who love LAYING ON HAND. &gt;&gt; WHILE PETER WAS WHAT? &gt;&gt; SPAKE THESE WORDS. &gt;&gt; WHILE PETER WHAT? &gt;&gt; YES. SPEAK. &gt;&gt; UHHUH. &gt;&gt; UHUH. LET'S READ. WHILE PETER WHAT? &gt;&gt; YET MEANS HE DIDN'T FINISH HIS SERMON. &gt;&gt; PETER WAS STILL TALKING. HE DIDN'T FINISH THE SERMON TO START THE PRAYER LINE WHILE PETER IS TALKING. THE HOLY GHOST INTERRUPTED. [cheering] &gt;&gt; YOU DON'T HAVE TO WAIT FOR THE END OF THE SERVICE. &gt;&gt; WHEN THE WORD IS COMING, [applause and cheering] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; GO TO THE BOOK OF ACT. &gt;&gt; GO LISTEN. GO READ the sermon of Peter. Yes sir. &gt;&gt; PETER WAS NOT PREACHING about the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; HE WAS PREACHING ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE. &gt;&gt; INTRODUCING TO THEM JESUS CHRIST. &gt;&gt; AND THE HOLY GHOST CAME. &gt;&gt; THE BIBLE SAY WHILE PETER YET WHAT &gt;&gt; SPAKE THESE WORDS. &gt;&gt; IT MUST BE FROM THE SPOKEN WORD. THE WHAT? &gt;&gt; HOLY GHOST &gt;&gt; FELL ON SOME OF THEM. &gt;&gt; ALL. &gt;&gt; ON HOW MANY PEOPLE? &gt;&gt; ALL. &gt;&gt; THAT DID WHAT? &gt;&gt; WHICH HEARD THE WORD. &gt;&gt; SO AS YOU HEARING THE WORD, &gt;&gt; FAITH COMETH FROM WHAT? &gt;&gt; HEARING. &gt;&gt; THE HOLY GHOST IS COMING. FAITH IS A REVELATION. THE HOLY GHOST IS A REVELATION OF JESUS CHRIST PERSONALLY TO YOU. &gt;&gt; SO WHEN I'M PREACHING RIGHT NOW, IT DEPENDS ON WHAT YOU WANT. &gt;&gt; THE HOLY GHOST CAN FEED YOU. &gt;&gt; THE HOLY GHOST CAN HEAL YOU. [screaming] &gt;&gt; THE HOLY GHOST CAN DELIVER YOU. [cheering] &gt;&gt; Are we together?

[cheering] &gt;&gt; AS YOU ARE RECEIVING JESUS HIMSELF BECAUSE JESUS IS THE WORD, &gt;&gt; are we together? &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? &gt;&gt; BROTHER BRANDHAM SAY WHEN I SEE WHAT &gt;&gt; I SEE WHAT &gt;&gt; HIS PROMISE. &gt;&gt; THE HOLY Ghost was a promise. &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost WAS A PROMISE. WHEN I SEE WHAT &gt;&gt; HIS PROMISE &gt;&gt; WHEN I SEE HIS PROMISE TO ME THAT IS WHAT? &gt;&gt; CHRIST. &gt;&gt; AND I DO WHAT? &gt;&gt; I EMBRACE IT. &gt;&gt; IF HE CAN LIE TO ME THAT IS WHAT &gt;&gt; EXACTLY THE TRUTH. &gt;&gt; I MIGHT NOT KNOW HOW TO TAKE A HOLD OF IT. &gt;&gt; BUT IT IS WHAT? &gt;&gt; THE TRUTH. &gt;&gt; I HOLD RIGHT WITH IT BECAUSE IT IS WHO? &gt;&gt; CHRIST TO ME. &gt;&gt; ALL I HAVE TO DO IS AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; I BELIEVE IT.

Why do you ask me a question? &gt;&gt; Devil, why do you ask a question? Why are you troubled if I have the Holy Ghost or not? &gt;&gt; So, there got to be something in me that is troubling you. &gt;&gt; WHY ARE YOU TRYING TO PUT DOUBT IN MY MIND? &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THE HOLY GHOST IS THERE. &gt;&gt; IT BEGINS TO BOTHER YOU.

WHY ARE THE PEOPLE BACKING UP? &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? &gt;&gt; THERE WAS SOMETHING THAT HAPPENED TO MOSES &gt;&gt; THAT WAS MAKING HIS FACE &gt;&gt; TO SHINE. &gt;&gt; HIS FACE WAS SENDING LIGHT.

Verse uh 32. AND TILL MOSES HAS DONE WHAT? &gt;&gt; Speaking with them &gt;&gt; with the congregation, he did what? &gt;&gt; Put a veil on his face. &gt;&gt; In other word, &gt;&gt; when Moses was coming, &gt;&gt; Moses was shining. &gt;&gt; EVERYBODY BACKED UP. &gt;&gt; MOSES SAID, "BE NOT AFRAID." &gt;&gt; IT IS. &gt;&gt; Come on. It is I. &gt;&gt; Take your time, brother. &gt;&gt; Take your time. &gt;&gt; Yes, SIR. &gt;&gt; HE SAY, "COME ALL OF YOU." AND THE CONGREGATION COME AND MOSES DELIVER THE SERMON. &gt;&gt; DAVID MOSES PREACHED THE THE THUNDERS. &gt;&gt; I'm watching my mouth. &gt;&gt; AND WHEN MOSES FINISHED PREACHING THE THUNDERS, &gt;&gt; he took a veil. &gt;&gt; My God. My God. My God. &gt;&gt; Amen, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen, LORD. &gt;&gt; HE DIDN'T VEIL HIS BODY. HIS BODY WAS ALREADY HAVING CLOTHING, &gt;&gt; BUT HE ONLY VEILED WHAT?

BUT WHEN MOSES WENT in before the Lord to speak with him, with God, HE DID WHAT? &gt;&gt; He took the VEIL OFF. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; UNTIL HE DID WHAT? &gt;&gt; Came out. &gt;&gt; I hope we ARE TOGETHER. &gt;&gt; SO WHEN MOSES IS AROUND THE CONGREGATION, HE'S LIKE THIS. COME ON. &gt;&gt; WHEN MOSES GOES TO GOD, WHEN HE REACHED GOD, &gt;&gt; HE OPEN &gt;&gt; AND GOD TALKED TO HIM FACE TO WHAT? &gt;&gt; SO THE FACE OF MOSES &gt;&gt; AND THE [screaming] FACE OF GOD CHURCH.

SO THE FACE OF GOD AND THE FACE OF MOSES WERE LOOKING AT EACH OTHER &gt;&gt; UNTIL WHEN MOSES removed &gt;&gt; the light &gt;&gt; OF THAT FACE BECAME ON MOSES. [applause] [cheering] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. &gt;&gt; I HOPE WE ARE TOGETHER. &gt;&gt; SO WHEN MOSES REACHED THE PEOPLE, HE DELIVERED THE LIGHT. &gt;&gt; IN OTHER WORDS, MOSES BECAME THE LIGHT. AMEN. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; My friend, this is ribs with bones. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? &gt;&gt; AND THE BIBLE SAY WHEN MOSES FINISHED TALKING, &gt;&gt; WHAT DID HE DO? &gt;&gt; His face. &gt;&gt; AND THEN HE GOES TO THE GENERATOR. &gt;&gt; AND WHEN HE REACHED THE GENERATOR, [screaming] HE OPENED THE FACE. AND THE GENERATOR BEGIN TO CHARGE. AH. &gt;&gt; [cheering] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? WHEN THE GENERATOR CHARGE CHARGE AND THE BATTERY IS FULL, &gt;&gt; MOSES CLOSES AGAIN &gt;&gt; AND HE GOES TO ISRAEL &gt;&gt; AND HE OPEN UP AND HE UNLOAD THE CHARGING &gt;&gt; AND THEN TOMORROW MOSES CLOSE. &gt;&gt; SO MOSES WAS [screaming] A BATTERY &gt;&gt; THAT WAS DISPATCHING CHARGES FROM GOD [screaming] TO THE PEOPLE. [cheering] THIS IS NOT ELEMENTARY MY FRIEND. I AM SOARING SOMEWHERE. &gt;&gt; CAN I CONTINUE? &gt;&gt; WHERE ARE WE AT, my friend? &gt;&gt; BUT WHEN MOSES WENT IN BEFORE THE LORD TO SPEAK WITH HIM, he did what? &gt;&gt; He took the veil OFF &gt;&gt; UNTIL HE DID WHAT? &gt;&gt; Because he's he's hooking the charging. &gt;&gt; THE FACE OF GOD is going toward Moses. &gt;&gt; And when he finished, Moses say, "Battery charge 100%." &gt;&gt; God say, "Go to the people." Amen. &gt;&gt; And Moses goes again and say where is your problem? &gt;&gt; Bring all your problem Israel hook the charging [laughter] &gt;&gt; the battery. Are we together? &gt;&gt; And the Bible say and the and and he came OUT AND HE CAME OUT AND SPOKE to water. &gt;&gt; Children of Israel &gt;&gt; that which he &gt;&gt; was command was command &gt;&gt; and the children of Israel saw the face of water &gt;&gt; Moses. &gt;&gt; SO GOD WAS TRANSFERRING HIS energy &gt;&gt; toward Moses. Amen. AND MOSES WAS REFLECTING GOD. &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. &gt;&gt; AND THE PEOPLE WERE SEEING GOD IN THE FACE OF MOSES. &gt;&gt; That's exactly right, brother. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In other word, if you want to see the effect &gt;&gt; of God, the effect of God, go see the face of Moses. AMEN. &gt;&gt; WHEN YOU SEE MOSES, you are receiving the face of God. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; AND THE FACE OF GOD CAME WITH THE WORD OF GOD. &gt;&gt; THE INSTRUCTION THAT WAS GIVEN TO MOSES &gt;&gt; BY [screaming] GOD TO GIVE TO ISRAEL. &gt;&gt; THAT INSTRUCTION OF THE THUNDER GOES WITH THE FAITH &gt;&gt; THAT BRING LIGHT. &gt;&gt; SLOW DOWN. WE ARE SOARING MY FRIEND. Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I know some of you. So Moses was God. Relax. &gt;&gt; Relax. &gt;&gt; Today you're going to swallow even bones. [snorts] &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; You're going to crack some bones, my friend. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; VERSE 35.

And Moses put the veil upon his face until he went to speak water &gt;&gt; with him. &gt;&gt; So when you see Moses, you don't see the head. &gt;&gt; The head of Moses doesn't exist anymore. &gt;&gt; When you see a face veil, &gt;&gt; h you know that it's Moses coming up. &gt;&gt; You will see him only when he got charge &gt;&gt; from God with a new message, &gt;&gt; with a new thunder &gt;&gt; and then he brings it and he deliver to you.

I want to say good. So, he goes in all all around internationally. Zakius. ZAKIUS WAS RICH. &gt;&gt; Very rich. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Some of you have problem. [laughter] &gt;&gt; You remember LAST SUNDAY WE FOUND OUT THAT JESUS CHRIST, the Bible says that for we know the grace of the Lord, our Lord JESUS CHRIST, THAT THOUGH HE was what? &gt;&gt; Rich, &gt;&gt; then he became what? &gt;&gt; For more. So that we through his poverty becomes HOW &gt;&gt; RICH. &gt;&gt; SO WE FOUND OUT THAT JESUS CONDESCENDED. &gt;&gt; You remember that? &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; HE WAS FIRST RICH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AND HE CONDESCENDED IN the level of poverty. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And when HE CONDESCENDED, HE MET JOSEPH. &gt;&gt; The husband of Mary. &gt;&gt; AND JOSEPH MATCHED THE DESCENDING. &gt;&gt; And Joseph also was poor. Amen. &gt;&gt; BUT ORIGINALLY JESUS IS RICH. &gt;&gt; It's right there in the Bible. Say amen MY FRIEND. &gt;&gt; THEN WE FOUND THAT JESUS WENT THROUGH HIS JOURNEY on earth &gt;&gt; AND BEFORE HE EXIT THE EARTH &gt;&gt; AND GO BACK TO THE FATHER, I CAME FROM GOD. I'M GOING BACK TO GOD. GOD, I'M GOING BACK TO GOD. WE FOUND THAT JESUS DIDN'T WANT TO BE UH IDENTIFIED WITH POOR PEOPLE IN THE IN THE GRAVE. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; IT WAS ISAIAH WHO PROPHESIED &gt;&gt; AND MEN OF OLD WERE ANOINTED BY THE HOLY GHOST. &gt;&gt; THE HOLY GHOST CHOSE A GRAVE OF A RICH MAN. &gt;&gt; HIS NAME WAS JOSEPH. OF &gt;&gt; ARAMATIA. &gt;&gt; HE WAS A RICH PERSON &gt;&gt; AND THE BIBLE SAY HE WAS JUST &gt;&gt; I GAVE YOU THE SCRIPTURE LAST TWO WEEKS. THE BIBLE SAY HE WAS A JUST AND A GOOD MAN. &gt;&gt; SO HIS MONEY KEPT HIM &gt;&gt; JUST &gt;&gt; AND A GOOD MAN. HIS PROSPERITY NEVER TOOK HIM AWAY &gt;&gt; BECAUSE HE WAS UNDER [screaming] PROPHECY. [cheering] &gt;&gt; I HOPE WE TOGETHER. &gt;&gt; I HOPE WE TOGETHER. &gt;&gt; SO THE JOURNEY OF JESUS, &gt;&gt; are we together? CAME FROM A POOR INTO A RICH. &gt;&gt; THE RICH WAS BECAUSE HE WAS EXITING THE WORLD. NOW HE BECAME RICH RIGHT HERE &gt;&gt; AND GOES BACK TO MUCH RICH IN HEAVEN. &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; THE BOOK OF HEBREWS SAYS THIS IN Hebrew 2 that we see who &gt;&gt; Jesus &gt;&gt; who was made what? &gt;&gt; A little lower than THE ANGELS &gt;&gt; FOR SUFFERING OF WHAT? &gt;&gt; OF DEATH. &gt;&gt; JESUS became poor. &gt;&gt; HE BECAME POOR CROWNED WITH WHAT? &gt;&gt; GLORY &gt;&gt; AND WHAT &gt;&gt; AND HONOR. SO THE POOR JESUS WAS ONLY CROWNED WITH GLORY AND HONOR. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; THAT BY THE GRACE OF GOD uh by the GRACE OF THAT HE BY THE GRACE OF GOD SHOULD TEST WHAT? &gt;&gt; Death for every man. &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? &gt;&gt; NOW WHEN JESUS ROSE AGAIN AND WENT TO HEAVEN IN THE BOOK OF REVELATION 5, THEY WERE LOOKING FOR A KINGSMAN REDEEMER. &gt;&gt; AMEN. BECAUSE THERE WAS A BOOK &gt;&gt; IN THE RIGHT HAND OF THE ONE THAT WAS SITTING on the throne. &gt;&gt; AND THEY SAY, "WHO IS WORTHY &gt;&gt; TO TAKE THE BOOK &gt;&gt; AND TO BREAK THE SEALS?" &gt;&gt; THERE WAS NO ONE IN HEAVEN. YOU KNOW THE STORY. &gt;&gt; NO ONE ON THE EARTH. &gt;&gt; NO ONE EVEN WHERE &gt;&gt; UNDERNEATH THE EARTH. &gt;&gt; EVEN IN HELL THERE WAS NOBODY. &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? AND THEN THEY SAY, "BEHOLD [screaming] THE LION." &gt;&gt; YES. &gt;&gt; OF JUDAH &gt;&gt; HAVE PREVAILED. AND WHEN HE CAME UP, HE CAME UP AS A LAMB. &gt;&gt; HE WAS THE LORD JESUS CHRIST. &gt;&gt; HE WAS NOT AN ANIMAL. &gt;&gt; HE was a HUMAN BEING. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE JOHN WHEN HE SAW JESUS A HUMAN BEING, HE SAID, "BEHOLD THE LAMB OF GOD." &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; SO WHEN JESUS CHRIST PICK UP THE BOOK, ALL THE ALL THE PEOPLE, ALL THE ANGEL, the 24, EVERYBODY BEGIN to scream. &gt;&gt; Amen. They say saying with what? &gt;&gt; A loud voice. &gt;&gt; What? &gt;&gt; WORTHY IS THE LAMB. &gt;&gt; WORTHY IS THE LAMB THAT WAS SLAIN. &gt;&gt; TO RECEIVE WHAT? &gt;&gt; POWER. &gt;&gt; IN OTHER WORDS, THE PURPOSE THAT HE WAS SLAIN WAS TO RECEIVE WHAT? &gt;&gt; POWER. &gt;&gt; AND WHAT? &gt;&gt; RICHES. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; SO JESUS WAS SLAIN TO RECEIVE WHAT? &gt;&gt; POWER. &gt;&gt; AND RECEIVE ALSO WHAT? &gt;&gt; RICHES. BECAUSE HE'S GOING [screaming] BACK OVER THERE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AH &gt;&gt; TO RECEIVE WHAT? &gt;&gt; RICHES. &gt;&gt; TO RECEIVE RICHES. &gt;&gt; This is in heaven. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This is in heaven. &gt;&gt; In heaven. THIS ALL OF THIS IS IN HEAVEN. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE HE JUST PICK UP THE book &gt;&gt; and everybody screaming that you were slain to receive what? &gt;&gt; Power. &gt;&gt; And to receive what? It means the resurrected Jesus have what? &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; He have power. &gt;&gt; And he has what? &gt;&gt; Riches. &gt;&gt; You understand now? And he also have what? &gt;&gt; Wisdom. &gt;&gt; And he also have what? &gt;&gt; Strength. &gt;&gt; And he also HAVE WHAT? &gt;&gt; HE ALSO have what? &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; AND HE ALSO HAVE WHAT? &gt;&gt; BLESSINGS. &gt;&gt; HE WAS NO LONGER THE JESUS THAT WAS IN &gt;&gt; GALILE. &gt;&gt; HE WAS A GLORIFIED JESUS. &gt;&gt; A JESUS THAT COULD CROSS THE WORLD. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. I hope we are together. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; SO WE UNDERSTAND NOW THE REASON WHY THIS JOSEPH HERE HAVE to be rich. &gt;&gt; Oh, &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? &gt;&gt; BECAUSE JESUS WAS GOING THROUGH HIS ORIGINAL FORM. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; And if YOU NOTICE, JOSEPH, THE POOR WAS AT THE BEGINNING. &gt;&gt; That's correct. Ah, &gt;&gt; can you say amen? No, YOU SLOWING ME DOWN. JOSEPH THE POOR WAS AT THE BEGINNING &gt;&gt; AND JOSEPH THE RICH WAS AT THE END. &gt;&gt; Are we together? WHEN JOSEPH THE RICH APPEAR, WHAT FOLLOW AFTER WAS THE RESURRECTION. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; AND WHAT FOLLOW THE RESURRECTION WAS THE RAPTURE. AMEN. &gt;&gt; THE OLD TESTAMENT SAINT, &gt;&gt; rose again, AND WERE TAKEN UP IN the rapture. &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. &gt;&gt; ONLY WHEN JOSEPH THE RICH WAS RAISED APPEAR ON THE SCENE. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; AND BROTHER BRANDHAM ALSO HAD A FAMILY. &gt;&gt; I'M NOT IN THE MOVE, &gt;&gt; BUT WORD MUST BE SPOKEN. IF IT'S IN THE COURT, WE MUST READ IT. &gt;&gt; BROTHER BRHAM HAS A FAMILY. &gt;&gt; AND HIS FIRST SON WAS WHO? &gt;&gt; AND BROTHER GIVE HIM THE NAME BASED ON THE APOSTLE PAUL. &gt;&gt; AND THE SECOND CHILD WAS WHO? &gt;&gt; WAS WHO? &gt;&gt; REBECCA. AND AFTER REBECCA, WHO FOLLOW? &gt;&gt; SARAH. &gt;&gt; AND AFTER SARAH, WHO FOLLOW? WHY DID JOSEPH APPEAR IN THIS END TIME? &gt;&gt; I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT YOUR MOVE. I'M TALKING ABOUT THE WORD. &gt;&gt; BROTHER BRHAM SAYS THIS IN THE MESSAGE, SIR. THIS IS THE TIME OF THE END TIME. WHEN BROTHER BRHAM SAW THE VISION OF THE CONSTELLATION, &gt;&gt; JOSEPH WAS THERE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; We need to stop and go home, my friend. &gt;&gt; Some of you have a problem. &gt;&gt; Do you have a problem with Trump? [cheering] &gt;&gt; Trump is in the Bible. &gt;&gt; There he is. [applause] &gt;&gt; Come on, brother. &gt;&gt; Joseph. Joseph is in THE BIBLE &gt;&gt; AND BROTHER BRANDHAM IN THE VISION of the constellation he says in this vision or I was speaking I LOOK AND I SAW WHAT &gt;&gt; A STRANGE THING &gt;&gt; NOW IT SEEMS LIKE THAT MY LITTLE SON JOSEPH &gt;&gt; WAS BY MY SIDE &gt;&gt; I WAS TALKING TO HIM NOW IF YOU SHALL DO WHAT &gt;&gt; WATCH the vision REAL CLOSE &gt;&gt; YOU SHALL SEE WHY JOSEPH WAS STANDING THERE THE VISION OF THE SEVEN ANGEL JOSEPH WAS THERE BUT HE WAS A LITTLE BOY. &gt;&gt; THE RESURRECTION CANNOT COME. &gt;&gt; THE RESURRECTION MUST COME WITH A GROWNUP [screaming] JOSEPH THAT HAS MONEY. [cheering] &gt;&gt; [laughter] &gt;&gt; You will HAVE A HARD TIME, MY FRIEND. &gt;&gt; Let me say it again. &gt;&gt; Let me say it. Let me say it again. Let me say it again, &gt;&gt; my friend. Because we going to start making our own Tik Tok. &gt;&gt; We tired of people chopping. We We will chop it. We will put it up &gt;&gt; because I DON'T WANT TO SOMEBODY CHOP ME ON THE wrong spot. &gt;&gt; I AM NOT in the moves in the message. &gt;&gt; I am inter denominational. &gt;&gt; I FELLOWSHIP WITH ALL THE BROTHER &gt;&gt; but I stand myself. &gt;&gt; BUT I LOVE THE BROTHER AND I LOVE THE ELDER. SO remove me in your in your move. But we must say the truth. &gt;&gt; We clear now. &gt;&gt; WE CLEAR NOW. JOSEPH IN THE VISION WAS A LITTLE BOY. &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? IN PARAGRAPH 209, THEN HE CAME TO ME WHILE I WAS WHERE &gt;&gt; IN THIS CONSTELLATION. &gt;&gt; NO, THAT IS NOT. IN OTHER WORDS, BROTHER THOUGHT HE'S GOING TO DIE. &gt;&gt; That's right. THAT'S WHAT HE SAID &gt;&gt; BECAUSE IT WAS AN EXPLOSION. &gt;&gt; BROTHER BRANDHAM SAY I'M GOING TO DIE AND GOD SAY HE SAYS NO. &gt;&gt; IT WAS NOT FOR YOUR DEATH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. HE WAS FOR THE COMING OF THE ANGEL AND BROTHER BRANDHAM AND THE LORD SAID NO THAT IS NOT. IF HE WOULD HAVE WHAT? &gt;&gt; Killed you. &gt;&gt; HE WOULD HAVE KILLED WHO? &gt;&gt; JOSEPH. &gt;&gt; AND HOW COULD HE JOSEPH DOING WHAT? &gt;&gt; CALLING ME. &gt;&gt; SO WHEN YOU SEE A JOSEPH WITH MONEY &gt;&gt; RICH JUST KNOW WE ARE APPROACHING SOMETHING. &gt;&gt; WHEN MONEY BEGIN TO BE GIVEN TO JOSEPH. WE ARE APPROACHING [screaming] THE RESURRECTION AND THE RAPTURE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. [cheering and applause] &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. IF YOU CAN'T SWALLOW THIS, I WON'T I WON'T MOVE. &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? &gt;&gt; BECAUSE GOD TOLD BROTHER, I WILL GIVE YOU A SON. &gt;&gt; HIS NAME WILL BE JOSEPH. AND WHEN MA WHEN UH MA GOT PREGNANT, HE WAS NOT A BOY. &gt;&gt; IT WAS A WOMAN THAT CAME UP &gt;&gt; AND THEY SAY, "IS THIS JOSEPHINE?" &gt;&gt; BROTHER BRANDHAM SAID, "NO, THIS IS SARAH." &gt;&gt; BECAUSE SARAH IS GENESIS 18, &gt;&gt; GENESIS 18. GOD MUST REVEAL HIMSELF IN HUMAN FLESH TO SARAH BEFORE JOSEPH PERFECTION COMES. I HOPE WE ARE TOGETHER. I'M USING A DIFFERENT GUN FROM ORLANDO, MY FRIEND. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? &gt;&gt; ARE YOU NOT SWALLOWING, MY FRIEND? &gt;&gt; Are we amen? &gt;&gt; Amen.

IF YOU HAVE A PROBLEM, IF YOU NOTICE WHEN JESUS WAS RAISED, JESUS ALWAYS ATTRACTED THESE TWO. &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THE PROBLEM IS WE LEAN TOO MUCH ON THE POOR. &gt;&gt; AND WE LEFT THE RICH. &gt;&gt; OH, JESUS ATTRACTED JOSEPH THE POOR. &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. AND JOSEPH THE RICH &gt;&gt; EVEN AT HIS BIRTH WHO WAS THE FIRST ONE TO MEET Jesus &gt;&gt; the what &gt;&gt; who saw the baby Jesus &gt;&gt; the major never saw the baby &gt;&gt; THAT'S A LIE OF CHRISTMAS &gt;&gt; SHEPHERD &gt;&gt; WHO SAW JESUS THE BABY FIRST &gt;&gt; THE SHEPHERD BROTHER SAYS THIS HE SAY NOTICE ANGEL COMING AND GIVING THE MESSAGE to the man of what &gt;&gt; SUCH A LOW WHEN THEY WERE MEN, THEY WERE MUCH MORE ATHLETIFIED THAN THESE WHAT? &gt;&gt; Than these poor. &gt;&gt; THEY WERE HOW &gt;&gt; ILLITERATE SHEPHERD. &gt;&gt; THEY WERE POOR AND WHAT? &gt;&gt; ILLITERATE SHEPHERD. &gt;&gt; THE SHEPHERD WAS THE MOST WHAT? &gt;&gt; ILLITERATE OF ANYBODY. &gt;&gt; HE DIDN'T KNOW NOTHING BUT JUST ABOUT WHAT? &gt;&gt; HIS SHEEP. &gt;&gt; WHEN HE WAS BORN, THE FIRST PEOPLE THAT CAME WERE POOR. &gt;&gt; I hope we are together.

He was poor. That's right. And when he went to heaven, &gt;&gt; when they ALL DIE, WE FOUND THAT the rich went to hell. &gt;&gt; But Lazarus went in the &gt;&gt; bosom &gt;&gt; of Abraham. &gt;&gt; SO HE WAS A SON OF ABRAHAM. &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. &gt;&gt; But we NEED TO KNOW ALSO WHAT IS THE ORIGIN OF ZAKAYOS? &gt;&gt; BECAUSE ZAKAYAS IS RICH. &gt;&gt; SO IS HE GOING TO GO IN HELL OR WHICH [screaming] SON IS HE SPIRITUALLY?

THE THE INVISIBLE O SWALLOW THIS MY FRIEND BROTHER SAY NOW THIS IS NOTHING AGAINST WHAT &gt;&gt; rich people &gt;&gt; if you TIRED WE STOP &gt;&gt; THIS IS NOTHING AGAINST WHAT &gt;&gt; RICH PEOPLE &gt;&gt; BECAUSE GOD CAN SAVE A WHAT &gt;&gt; A RICH MAN &gt;&gt; AND SOME OF OUR CHILDREN ARE WHAT &gt;&gt; rich &gt;&gt; say amen &gt;&gt; I didn't hear GOOD AMEN &gt;&gt; [cheering] &gt;&gt; SO DON'T JUDGE ONE ANOTHER. &gt;&gt; DON'T JUDGE [screaming] ONE ANOTHER. &gt;&gt; IF YOU POOR, DON'T JUDGE THE RICH. &gt;&gt; IF YOU RICH, DON'T JUDGE THE POOR. &gt;&gt; BOTH OF YOU ARE CHILDREN OF GOD. [cheering] &gt;&gt; I hope we together. &gt;&gt; I hope WE TOGETHER. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; BROTHER BRANDHAM SAY GOD CAN SAVE ALSO THE WHO? &gt;&gt; SO WE MUST SEE WHAT HAPPENED TO ZAKIUS.

ME, I'M HUMBLE. I DON'T TALK ABOUT MONEY. [cheering] &gt;&gt; MONEY IS A PROBLEM ALSO TO YOU. &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY SOLOMON IN HIS PRAYER &gt;&gt; HE SAID DON'T GIVE ME POVERTY &gt;&gt; BECAUSE I WILL BE BOUND TO GO STEAL &gt;&gt; TO GO TO CROOKED DEALS. ARE WE TOGETHER? &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? SO MONEY IS NOT A PROBLEM FOR THE RICH PEOPLE ONLY. IT'S ALSO A PROBLEM FOR THOSE WHO WHAT? &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Some of you are very quiet. &gt;&gt; I'm going to shoot again fire. &gt;&gt; I'm going to shoot again fire. &gt;&gt; Oh, &gt;&gt; you don't want the word. &gt;&gt; You don't want the word. &gt;&gt; Let me get IT TO YOU. BROTHER IS TALKING ABOUT THE RICH YOUNG RULER. &gt;&gt; He says when did he HAVE IT? WHEN JESUS SAYS WHAT? &gt;&gt; Follow me. &gt;&gt; But he did what? &gt;&gt; Turned it down. &gt;&gt; He went the way that he could make what? &gt;&gt; Money. &gt;&gt; He could do what? &gt;&gt; Make money. &gt;&gt; MAKE MONEY. AND THAT [screaming] IS ALL RIGHT. &gt;&gt; ALL RIGHT. &gt;&gt; I know you won't say amen. &gt;&gt; But wait with what is coming. &gt;&gt; I know you won't say amen. I already know message believer. BUT THIS IS 63 AFTER the seals. &gt;&gt; YOU WILL SAY AMEN. &gt;&gt; THAT IS WHAT &gt;&gt; ALL RIGHT &gt;&gt; NOTHING WRONG WITH MAKING MONEY. &gt;&gt; Say amen. [cheering] &gt;&gt; Say &gt;&gt; amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; THIS WAY. SAY AMEN. &gt;&gt; Big boss. I'M NOT HEARING YOUR AMEN. NOT. &gt;&gt; DID I SAY IT? &gt;&gt; NO. &gt;&gt; DID I SAY IT? &gt;&gt; NO. &gt;&gt; NOTHING WRONG WITH DOING WHAT? &gt;&gt; MAKING MONEY. &gt;&gt; BUT FOLLOW JESUS WHILE YOU ARE [screaming] &gt;&gt; DOING IT. [cheering] &gt;&gt; IN OTHER WORDS, IF YOU ARE IN YOUR BUSINESS, KEEP GOD FIRST. KEEP THE MESSAGE FIRST. KEEP THE WORD FIRST. YOU MAKING YOUR TRANSACTION, YOU KEEPING GOD. YOU MAKING YOUR TRANSACTION, YOU KEEPING GOD. GIVE GOD THE FIRST PLACE. [cheering and applause] &gt;&gt; Sorry y'all. God has his time to clear and free his children. &gt;&gt; You shall know the truth &gt;&gt; and the truth will set, not me, the truth &gt;&gt; will set you free. THE WORD THAT I SPEAK, &gt;&gt; THEY ARE SPIRIT &gt;&gt; AND THEY ARE LIFE. &gt;&gt; THEY ARE ALSO DELIVERANCE &gt;&gt; BECAUSE GOD SENT HIS WORD TO HEAL. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? &gt;&gt; SO, ZAKIUS IS A RICH man &gt;&gt; and he's poor. &gt;&gt; Maybe people has been judging him. message believer of that time when they pass through Zakius they say sinner &gt;&gt; when he's driving his uh when he's driving his Mercedes they say these things will be burned on fire &gt;&gt; the coming of the Lord is coming &gt;&gt; are we together &gt;&gt; WHEN ZAKUS CHANGE TO A NEW CAR EVERYBODY IS UNCOMFORTABLE JEALOUSY. &gt;&gt; ZAKIUS, THESE ARE WORLDLY THINGS. &gt;&gt; BUT BROTHER BRANDHAM GAVE US THE NAME OF THE WIFE OF ZAKIUS &gt;&gt; AND IT'S NOT WRITTEN IN THE BIBLE. [screaming] &gt;&gt; IT WAS IN THE THUNDERS. &gt;&gt; HER NAME WAS REBECCA. ARE YOU THERE? &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? HER NAME WAS REBECCA. SISTER REBECCA IS right there. &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? &gt;&gt; AND SHE WAS THE ONE PRAYING FOR HER HUSBAND, &gt;&gt; THE SINNER, &gt;&gt; THE [screaming] RICH MAN. &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? &gt;&gt; REMEMBER THE RICH YOUNG RULER? HIS PROBLEM was povert I mean with the POOR PEOPLE. &gt;&gt; HE DIDN'T WANT TO SHARE WITH THE POOR. &gt;&gt; AND JESUS SAY YOUR PROBLEM IS ONLY ONE THING. begin to share with the poor. &gt;&gt; He didn't listen. SO WHEN LAZARUS THE POOR WAS AT THE DOOR, HE COULD NOT GIVE HIM SOMETHING TO GET THE BROTHER OUT OF TROUBLE. &gt;&gt; I HOPE WE ARE TOGETHER. REMEMBER HE CALLED ABRAHAM, HE ALSO CALLED ABRAHAM FATHER ABRAHAM. &gt;&gt; SO BOTH OF THEM WERE CHURCHGOING PEOPLE. &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. &gt;&gt; I hope we are together.

Zakayas search the Bible SAY AND HE COULD NOT FOR the water the press which is the crowd BECAUSE HE WAS A WHAT &gt;&gt; little stature &gt;&gt; so the height is not a problem &gt;&gt; are we together &gt;&gt; SO ZAKIUS TRIED TO SEE JESUS THE CROWD EVERYBODY'S TALL THE BROTHER is the sinner is trying &gt;&gt; he jump ON THE CHAIR AH WHAT IS IN YOU &gt;&gt; THAT WANT TO SEE GOD? &gt;&gt; WHAT IS IN YOU &gt;&gt; THAT WANT TO SEE JESUS? &gt;&gt; WHAT IS IN YOU THAT IS MAKING EVERY EFFORT &gt;&gt; TO SEE GOD? &gt;&gt; AND PEOPLE ARE CALLING YOU SINNERS. &gt;&gt; PEOPLE ARE CALLING YOU FANATICS.

And he did what? &gt;&gt; Ran before. &gt;&gt; And did what? &gt;&gt; Climbed up into a sycamore tree. &gt;&gt; A sycamore tree. Let's leave it alone.

I'm too short. I try everything I can't. He ran on the other side by the gas station over there and went there by the gas station. He looked here. God provided a sycamore tree. &gt;&gt; THE ONE WHO WAS PLANTING THE SYCAMORE DIDN'T KNOW the reason WHY HE PLANT. HE THOUGHT HE WAS PLANTING A TREE. &gt;&gt; HE DIDN'T KNOW GOD WAS PUTTING SOMETHING TO HELP ZAKOS. IN OTHER WORDS, WHEN YOU A CHILD OF GOD, GOD WILL EVEN PLANT A TREE &gt;&gt; TO BRING YOU TO HIM. &gt;&gt; You didn't get ME WHERE. GOD WILL DO EVERYTHING &gt;&gt; to make sure HE GETS YOU BACK TO HIM. [cheering] [applause] FOR THAT DAY THE SYCAMORE TREE WAS NOT A TREE. &gt;&gt; It become a lad. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Now look at a rich man. &gt;&gt; Follow me very carefully. A rich man begin to climb A TREE. &gt;&gt; HE FORGOT HE HAD MONEY. &gt;&gt; HIS MONEY BEFORE JESUS WAS NOT A PROBLEM. IF HE NEED TO CLIMB A TREE FOR JESUS, HE WILL CLIMB A TREE. &gt;&gt; THAT'S THE [screaming] RICH MAN OF GOD. [cheering] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; BROTHER ZAKOS CLIMBED THE TREE AND SAT DOWN. He says, "Now I'm going to at least see him &gt;&gt; how he's coming." &gt;&gt; He sat right there. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? He didn't know the aspiration that was coming from him &gt;&gt; was coming from the maker. &gt;&gt; The maker was working with him. &gt;&gt; In other words, it was not his intelligence. &gt;&gt; IT WAS GOD THAT TOLD HIM, "I'M going to pass there. GO CLIMB ON A TREE. I WILL MEET YOU THERE." &gt;&gt; IT WAS ZAKAYAS AND AND &gt;&gt; IT WAS ZAKAYAS GOD &gt;&gt; AND JESUS GOD THAT WERE TALKING. NOT THIS IS A CHAOS. &gt;&gt; THERE'S A CHAOS INSIDE. &gt;&gt; THAT ONE SYNCHRONIZED WITH GOD. &gt;&gt; IN OTHER WORDS, WHEN GOD IS COMING, THAT ONE IS SAYING, "Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER?" &gt;&gt; JOB TO verse uh five. AND WHEN JESUS CAME WHERE &gt;&gt; TO THE PLACE &gt;&gt; HE DID WHAT? &gt;&gt; He looked up. &gt;&gt; How did Jesus know somebody was there? Huh? &gt;&gt; JESUS WAS GOING. EVERYBODY was going and they heard Jesus. &gt;&gt; He looked up. In other words, I know you &gt;&gt; when you were looking for me there. I already seen you. &gt;&gt; I ALREADY KNEW YOU BEFORE YOU EVEN KNEW ME. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? &gt;&gt; AMEN. NOW, WHO WAS LOOKING UP? &gt;&gt; JESUS. &gt;&gt; WHO WAS SUPPOSED TO LOOK UP? &gt;&gt; NOW, who's looking up? &gt;&gt; JESUS. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; AND HE LOOKED UP AND SAW HIM AND SAID TO HIM, "WHAT?" &gt;&gt; ZAKAYAS. &gt;&gt; How did he know his name? &gt;&gt; I'm almost finishing because I know I can't touch the parable of the No, I can't touch the parable of the temper. We got to get We need to find a different uh subject to this. Amen. HE SAYS, "AND ZAKARIUS, make what?" &gt;&gt; Haste. &gt;&gt; In other words, hurry &gt;&gt; and do what? &gt;&gt; And come down &gt;&gt; for when? &gt;&gt; Today &gt;&gt; I must do what? &gt;&gt; Abide at thy house. &gt;&gt; So something when Jesus saw Zakayos &gt;&gt; and he saw what was in Zakayas, &gt;&gt; he say change the direction. &gt;&gt; We got to go this way. Zak, this is not about you seeing me. I'm coming to your house. &gt;&gt; The house of a rich man. &gt;&gt; Not Mcdana. &gt;&gt; The house of a rich man. &gt;&gt; A rich man that is sinner. &gt;&gt; Can I continue? &gt;&gt; Can I continue? &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THE PHARISEE CRITICIZED JESUS. &gt;&gt; They say, "You see where he's going?" Right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Can I continue? &gt;&gt; Can I continue? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he did what? &gt;&gt; Made haste. &gt;&gt; Made haste and did what? &gt;&gt; He came down &gt;&gt; and receive him how &gt;&gt; joyfully. &gt;&gt; How can he receive Jesus joyful? What was in Zakayas the sinner? &gt;&gt; THAT WHEN JESUS IS COMING, ZAK is like, "Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. &gt;&gt; AMEN. [screaming] JESUS IN MY HOME. OH, PRAISE THE LORD. HALLELUJAH.

AND WHEN THEY SAW IT, &gt;&gt; MESSAGE BELIEVER OF THAT TIME, THEY DID WHAT? &gt;&gt; THEY ALL MURMURED. &gt;&gt; THE MURMUR SAID THAT HE WAS GONE TO BE WHAT? &gt;&gt; GUESS &gt;&gt; WITH A MAN THAT IS WHAT? &gt;&gt; A SINNER. &gt;&gt; A sinner. &gt;&gt; Let's see what happened. VERSE EIGHT. AND ZAKAYAS DID WHAT? &gt;&gt; STOOD. &gt;&gt; AND SAY WHAT? unto the Lord. &gt;&gt; PUSH THE BRAKE, MY FRIEND. WHO PREACHED TO ZAKAYOS? &gt;&gt; I'm I'm I'm about to stop because we have not started the parable. &gt;&gt; Who stop who preached Zakos? &gt;&gt; Who preach him? &gt;&gt; So where is he coming from with this? &gt;&gt; AND LISTEN TO WHAT IS coming from the mouth of Zakayas. &gt;&gt; Zakius without any sermon. Can I continue? &gt;&gt; Zako says, "LORD, WHAT?" &gt;&gt; BEHOLD. &gt;&gt; BEHOLD, LORD, WHAT? &gt;&gt; The half of MY GOODS. &gt;&gt; THE HALF of my money. &gt;&gt; THAT'S CORRECT. &gt;&gt; I GIVE IT TO WHO? &gt;&gt; THE POOR. &gt;&gt; I GIVE IT TO WHO? &gt;&gt; THE POOR. &gt;&gt; WHO INSTRUCT HIM TO GIVE TO THE POOR? THE rich young ruler Jesus told him give it to the poor. &gt;&gt; He gave him instruction. He was unable to RECEIVE IT. BUT ZAKUS NOBODY AS SOON AS JESUS ENTER IN HIS HOUSE that was it. &gt;&gt; Revelation [clears throat] begin to come. THE PRESENCE OF JESUS BEGIN TO BRING REVELATION. &gt;&gt; AND SUDDENLY ZAKO SAY YOU KNOW WHAT JESUS &gt;&gt; LORD AND LUKE look he's calling him Lord &gt;&gt; a sinner calling him Lord. HE SAID LORD I'M GOING TO GET half of my money. &gt;&gt; Not all the money half of it &gt;&gt; and I'm going to give it to who? &gt;&gt; The poor. &gt;&gt; Why the poor? Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; I'm going to do what the rich young ruler was able to do. &gt;&gt; I'm going to give it to the poor. And when you give it to the poor, you are having treasure? &gt;&gt; In heaven. &gt;&gt; SO, ZAKAYOS MUST COME from where? &gt;&gt; Heaven. &gt;&gt; ZAKOS MUST COME FROM WHERE? &gt;&gt; HEAVEN. &gt;&gt; UH-HUH. And he says, I'm going to give it to the poor. AND IF I HAVE TAKEN WHO TAUGHT HIM REPENTANCE AND RESTORATION. IF I HAVE TAKEN WHAT &gt;&gt; anything &gt;&gt; from what? &gt;&gt; Any man &gt;&gt; by what? &gt;&gt; False accusation. &gt;&gt; I WILL RESTORE WHAT &gt;&gt; HIM FOURFOLD. &gt;&gt; THIS IS WHAT CAME OUT from the mouth of David. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; I WILL REPAY FOUR. WHO TAUGHT HIM ALL OF THIS? &gt;&gt; WHO PREACHED TO HIM? &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; The rich man. &gt;&gt; Can I continue? I'm going to FINISH MY FRIEND. AND JESUS SAID TO HIM &gt;&gt; THIS DAY &gt;&gt; IS WHAT? &gt;&gt; SALVATION. &gt;&gt; COME WHERE? &gt;&gt; TO THIS HOUSE. &gt;&gt; FOR AS MUCH ALSO AS he &gt;&gt; he is what? &gt;&gt; A SON OF ABRAHAM. &gt;&gt; ZAKAYOS [screaming] WAS A WHAT? &gt;&gt; A SON OF ABRAHAM. &gt;&gt; YOU DON'T GET THAT CORRECTLY. &gt;&gt; BY FLESH. ZAKAYOS WAS A JEW. HE WAS ALREADY A SON OF ABRAHAM. &gt;&gt; BUT THE SON OF ABRAHAM, JESUS IS SAYING HERE, IS NOT THE FLESH SON OF ABRAHAM. &gt;&gt; HE'S SAYING ZAKAYAS &gt;&gt; IS FROM [screaming] THE ORIGIN OF ABRAHAM. &gt;&gt; IT'S THE PEOPLE THAT [screaming] ARE BORN WITH FAITH. &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? SO IF ZAKAYOS DIED, you will see him in paradise with Lazarus. &gt;&gt; Lazarus the poor and Zakayos the RICH MAN. AND BROTHER BRANDHAM PREACH MESSAGES ABOUT ZAKAYOS. &gt;&gt; Because God can save the rich &gt;&gt; AND HIS CHILDREN ARE AMONG THE RICH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? FOR THE SON OF MAN IS COME TO DO WHAT? &gt;&gt; AND TO SAVE THAT WHICH WAS WHAT? &gt;&gt; LOST. &gt;&gt; AND AS THEY HEARD [screaming] THESE THINGS, THE PHARISEE, HE ADDED AND SPOKE A WHAT? &gt;&gt; A PARABLE. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE HE WAS NEAR WHAT? &gt;&gt; TO JERUSALEM. &gt;&gt; AND BECAUSE THEY THOUGHT THAT THE KINGDOM OF GOD SHOULD do what? &gt;&gt; IMMEDIATELY APPEAR. &gt;&gt; AND HE SAYS A CERTAIN [screaming] NOBLE MAN &gt;&gt; WENT INTO A WHAT? FOR A COUNTRY &gt;&gt; TO RECEIVE FOR HIMSELF WHAT &gt;&gt; A KINGDOM &gt;&gt; AND HE RETURNED AND HE CALLED WHAT [screaming] &gt;&gt; HIS 10 SERVANTS &gt;&gt; AND DELIVER UNTO THEM WHAT &gt;&gt; 10 POUNDS &gt;&gt; PUSH THE BRAKE LET'S STOP here &gt;&gt; let's stand Pray for me.

Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The word of God are spirit. Yes. &gt;&gt; And his word are life. &gt;&gt; Your God is a mighty God. &gt;&gt; He's a rich man. He's a Boaz. &gt;&gt; He became poor so that through your his poverty, you can become what? &gt;&gt; He came from Joseph the poor all the way to Joseph and then goes back again. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? And when you see a Joseph that is appearing again in this end time and getting money, just know we getting ready for the rapture. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; You call this the mystery of a rich Joseph? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen.
