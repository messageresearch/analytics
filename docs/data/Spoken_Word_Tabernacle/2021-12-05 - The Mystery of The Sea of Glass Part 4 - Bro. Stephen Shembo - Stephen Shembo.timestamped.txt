[46:43] Lord I believe that will be it for the
[46:47] announcement let's go to the
[46:51] scripture Wednesday was uh special
[46:58] anointing
[46:59] amen yes
[47:04] Amen brother khma is on his 25th wedding
[47:11] anniversary
[47:13] wonderful amen amen so somebody
[47:17] must take care of that missing
[47:21] spot because we got to
[47:24] preach amen
[47:26] I told him I say we're sure going to
[47:28] miss
[47:30] you yeah
[47:32] amen but I believe he should be he's
[47:35] probably streaming if I'm not
[47:38] mistaken or he's going to stream later
[47:41] if you there you can say amen I read
[47:44] these three scripture on Wednesday and
[47:46] could not even touch to any of them so
[47:49] we have to go back again and try to see
[47:52] if we can get it Genesis 14
[47:56] Verse 18 if you there you can say amen
[48:01] amen
[48:04] hallelujah and mized you know who he is
[48:09] right you don't know how many knows who
[48:12] melchisedek
[48:15] is okay and melchisedek king of
[48:21] Salem you might be
[48:24] seated
[48:26] melkisedek is a
[48:30] king melchisedek is a
[48:33] king king of Salem what does he
[48:39] mean melc king of
[48:42] Salem brought forth
[48:51] Bread and Wine and he was the the priest
[48:56] of the most high God this King brought
[49:00] forth Bread and Wine and we understand
[49:02] that he was a
[49:04] priest and he brought Bread and
[49:10] Wine because the way you can recognize
[49:14] God you need to recognize God according
[49:16] to his characteristics amen amen because
[49:20] God sometime hide or God uh imorph amen
[49:26] he can change form but if you know how
[49:29] he operate you can detect whether it's
[49:32] God or not amen amen so it's very
[49:35] important okay king of Salem brought
[49:39] forth Bread and Wine and he was the
[49:42] priest of the most high God so it looks
[49:45] like God have a
[49:47] priest so it's like God and a
[49:51] priest that's what you think but it's
[49:53] not the case and and he bless him and
[49:57] say Blessed Be Abraham of the most high
[50:01] God like the two different person
[50:04] possessor of Heaven and Earth and
[50:07] blessed be the most high God which has
[50:10] delivered your enemy into your hand and
[50:14] he Abraham gave him T of all so the
[50:18] first person that PID T not to a human
[50:22] being to this man called melkisedek is
[50:28] abrah amen am blessed be the name of the
[50:32] Lord let's go to Psalm
[50:36] 110 brother cellb do we have those new
[50:41] one yeah that's these are the two I can
[50:43] see
[50:49] here Psalm 110 if you there you can say
[50:53] Amen verse four
[51:00] if you look at P pages are still
[51:03] turning if you look at Psalm
[51:06] 110 rather at the beginning the Bible
[51:08] say a Psalm of
[51:10] who so who got the revelation of
[51:13] this who enter into the temple and ate
[51:16] the
[51:20] showbread amen who built a tabernacle
[51:23] when God told him that he was not
[51:25] qualified to build the temple who
[51:28] changed the order of the
[51:30] Tabernacle what is wrong with this
[51:36] boy what is wrong with this boy amen
[51:39] amen this one is gone probably yeah
[51:43] amen so Psalm of David verse four the
[51:48] Lord has
[51:50] Sor and will not repent there is no
[51:53] changing to this amen you you who is
[51:57] you so somebody's there and David is
[52:01] watching this and God s to that person
[52:05] and say you so it looks like there is a
[52:07] God and there is a person and God is
[52:09] telling that person you just like
[52:11] brother Benjamin is here and I say you
[52:14] everybody clear you who you are a
[52:19] priest I thought we already have a
[52:21] priest but this is another person that
[52:24] they're talking about being a priest you
[52:26] are a priest
[52:28] Forever After the order of melchisedec
[52:33] so according to Psalm
[52:35] 110 there is another
[52:39] person there that David is giving a
[52:42] prophecy that that person is a
[52:47] priest after the order of melkisedek we
[52:50] explain to you on Wednesday that it
[52:52] means what in the likeness
[52:56] everybody clear in the likeness or like
[53:00] or in the
[53:03] similitude of meis EDC everybody here so
[53:09] if you look at this
[53:12] person he look like melis
[53:16] EDC is he
[53:18] okay if you check him his behavior his
[53:24] stuff everything he's doing look exactly
[53:27] like
[53:29] melkisedek so is melchisedec higher than
[53:32] this man or this man is equal to
[53:35] melkisedek or this man is separate than
[53:38] melchisedek so how many priests do we
[53:40] have in
[53:43] heaven let's go to Revelation chapter
[53:48] one in Genesis it's easy it's melkisedek
[53:52] we know him but in Psalm we have have an
[53:55] X it's an unknown person we don't know
[53:58] him everybody clear they just say you
[54:03] are a priest who who is that person that
[54:06] is a priest that will look like melkis
[54:09] EDC amen that will follow the trace of
[54:16] mesc after the DNA of
[54:22] M amen re
[54:25] 1
[54:27] verse 5 let's go to verse 6 because we
[54:31] read this a lot and he and has made us
[54:35] Kings and Priests to God his father to
[54:39] him be glory and Dominion forever and
[54:43] ever amen now John is showing that we
[54:47] also God the Lord Jesus Christ when he
[54:50] came he made as priest and King and we
[54:54] already know that that promised to be
[54:56] priest was given to the Jews and he
[54:58] moved from the Jews all the way to the
[55:00] Gentile amen blessed be the name of the
[55:03] Lord let's go to Revelation
[55:07] 5 remember when God deal with the Jews
[55:10] he's dealing with one nation only right
[55:13] right which is the nation of Israel so
[55:16] everything is given to One Nation A
[55:19] peculiar Nation A peculiar country only
[55:23] the Jew he's the god of Israel
[55:26] he didn't say he was the god of
[55:29] Egypt everybody care so the priesthood
[55:33] of Moses was applied to
[55:36] Israel amen Revelation
[55:40] 5 let's go to verse uh8 and when he had
[55:45] taken the book The Four Beast and the
[55:48] four and 20 Elders fell down before the
[55:51] lamb having every one of them Harps we
[55:54] understand that now and golden vow full
[55:57] of ERS which are the prayers of Saint
[56:00] and they sung a new song saying you are
[56:02] worthy to take the book that's why the
[56:05] taking of the book is a problem and to
[56:08] open the seals thereof very important
[56:11] for you were slain and have redeemers to
[56:15] God so if they redeem you they're
[56:17] bringing you back to your original
[56:19] position if they redeeming you back to
[56:22] Gastonia means you were living in
[56:24] Gastonia
[56:25] make sense am so if they redeem you back
[56:28] to God means you were in God you just
[56:31] came out of God so they have to take you
[56:33] and pull you back again where you come
[56:35] from amen amen so something happened
[56:38] that you left
[56:43] de
[56:45] everybody before you get to heaven in
[56:49] the literal you must get to heaven in
[56:51] the
[56:53] spiritual amen did it make sense you
[56:56] cannot enter Heaven just like that you
[56:59] must be restored first in the
[57:02] spiritual then you can be restored in
[57:05] the natural everybody care so they
[57:08] bringing back to you to God in other
[57:11] words you must first become
[57:13] [Music]
[57:18] God then you can leave where God
[57:23] is amen that's what the word say for you
[57:27] were slain and has redeemers to God by
[57:31] your blood remember the two blood out of
[57:35] every
[57:36] what why every
[57:38] Kindred because this religion belong to
[57:41] the
[57:44] Jews everybody here so through
[57:51] Christ the
[57:53] borders of salvation are
[57:57] open is he okay he goes
[58:04] everywhere everybody everybody here
[58:07] because the levitical priesthood only
[58:09] was for
[58:12] Israel
[58:14] amen your blood out of every Kindred and
[58:18] tongue and people and Nation so
[58:21] everybody now can be Redeemed by God not
[58:25] only the Jewish people verse 10 and has
[58:29] made us so not only are we redeemed from
[58:33] every tongue every Kindred Every Nation
[58:37] now we are not only redeemed but we are
[58:41] made Kings and what and have made us to
[58:45] our god Kings and Priests and we shall
[58:49] reign on the earth
[58:53] Millennium that's that's why the seven
[58:55] SE usher in the Millennium that's why
[58:57] brother Bram says that everybody clear
[59:00] now let's
[59:01] pray you keep your Bible open in
[59:05] Revelation
[59:07] 4 Heavenly Father Lord we are
[59:09] approaching you humbly again this
[59:11] morning Father thanking you for

[59:37] of being consecrated and preparing
[59:40] themselves for the service father may

[59:45] away from this place every fear of

[1:00:01] the Omega of this service and speak to
[1:00:03] our soul in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:00:07] amen amen God richly bless you we are
[1:00:10] dealing with part four and we still
[1:00:14] handling the priesthood everybody clear
[1:00:17] we spoke about the five Dwelling Place
[1:00:20] of God Amen we talked about God going
[1:00:25] into the Tabernacle of Moses then into
[1:00:28] the Temple of Solomon then into the
[1:00:32] Temple of Christ and then into the
[1:00:34] temple that is called the brde which is
[1:00:36] a many member Temple but in between the
[1:00:39] Tabernacle of David uh the Tabernacle of
[1:00:42] Moses and the Temple of Solomon we saw
[1:00:45] that David built also a tabernacle which
[1:00:47] was called The Tabernacle of David amen
[1:00:51] now we found on Wednesday that there is
[1:00:53] three aspect that goes with a temple or
[1:00:56] a Dwelling Place number one the first
[1:00:59] aspect that goes with it is you must
[1:01:02] have a priest yes am or if I can call it
[1:01:06] a priesthood everybody clear number two
[1:01:09] you must have a
[1:01:10] sacrifice everybody clear and number
[1:01:13] three there is a
[1:01:15] service or a Ministry that goes with it
[1:01:19] amen now when we are refocusing ourself
[1:01:23] into The Mystery of the lever here what
[1:01:27] I want you to notice is if you recall
[1:01:30] the lever was placed between the Bren
[1:01:33] Altar and the door of the Tabernacle I
[1:01:37] want you to keep your seat belt amen
[1:01:40] amen yeah
[1:01:41] so so the lever was placed between the
[1:01:45] Bren Altar and then the uh door of the
[1:01:49] temple and if you notice here this
[1:01:52] entrance of the Temple have five
[1:01:57] pillars do you see that let me help
[1:02:01] somebody if you look at the entrance of
[1:02:03] the temple here we have a first pillar a
[1:02:07] second one a third a fourth and a fifth
[1:02:10] so when Moses was building the
[1:02:13] Tabernacle if you look at the Tabernacle
[1:02:16] from the entrance if you coming straight
[1:02:19] into the Tabernacle there was something
[1:02:22] that they call the door of the
[1:02:23] Tabernacle
[1:02:25] everybody clear but when you come to the
[1:02:28] Tabernacle right here God told Moses he
[1:02:31] said Take Five Pillars and put them
[1:02:34] right here do you follow me amen so
[1:02:37] Moses took and put one pillar right here
[1:02:40] everybody clear amen then he put the
[1:02:43] second pillar here then he put the third
[1:02:46] pillar here then he put the fourth
[1:02:49] pillar here then he put the fifth pillar
[1:02:52] here everybody care amen if if you take
[1:02:54] one 2 3 4 five it gives you five pillars
[1:02:59] everybody clear that's what you saw
[1:03:01] there amen then God say take a curtain
[1:03:05] and put a curtain over there that's why
[1:03:07] I told you to keep your seat belt
[1:03:09] everybody here so these five pillars
[1:03:14] here divided the entrance of the
[1:03:17] tabernacle into four
[1:03:22] entrance are we okay amen
[1:03:25] we if you remove the pillars you can
[1:03:27] enter into the Tabernacle straight
[1:03:30] without any problem so but when God told
[1:03:33] Moses he said put those five pillars
[1:03:36] here now the entrance you can enter here
[1:03:39] everybody care you can enter here you
[1:03:43] can enter here you can enter here
[1:03:46] everybody here now the entrance of the
[1:03:48] Tabernacle is no longer one but he
[1:03:51] becomes four everybody clear so you have
[1:03:54] a combination of five and
[1:03:58] four don't worry my friend we'll be okay
[1:04:01] amen everybody here so when we pull
[1:04:05] right here the mystery of the lever
[1:04:06] right here there is no way that you can
[1:04:10] separate the lever with the
[1:04:13] priesthood everybody here that's why we
[1:04:16] were being Express I mean explaining the
[1:04:19] priesthood from Aaron all the way as
[1:04:21] we're going to get into melc everybody
[1:04:23] clear because the lever itself when he
[1:04:26] was created or when he was manufactured
[1:04:29] or made he was for the priest amen
[1:04:33] everybody clear so the lever is always
[1:04:36] associated with a priesthood amen
[1:04:38] everybody here amen and when he was made
[1:04:41] at first the L was made for the service
[1:04:44] of the priest amen everybody clear check
[1:04:49] so when the the priests are going to
[1:04:53] minister unto the Lord Lord or when the
[1:04:55] priest are going to do service unto the
[1:04:58] Lord everybody here they have to use the
[1:05:00] lever for their service amen everybody
[1:05:03] here but later on further we found out
[1:05:06] that the L was not only for the service
[1:05:08] of the priest but the L was also for the
[1:05:11] washing of the
[1:05:15] sacrifice so we got the three element
[1:05:18] the service of the ministry connected to
[1:05:20] the lever we got the sacrifice connected
[1:05:23] to the ever now we missing the priest
[1:05:27] itself everybody clear Amen in Exodus
[1:05:32] 40 we found out that God told Moses and
[1:05:35] thou shall anoint the L and his foot and
[1:05:39] stify it and that shall bring Aaron and
[1:05:43] his son unto the door of the Tabernacle
[1:05:47] of the congregation and wash them with
[1:05:50] water so the lever help the priest thems
[1:05:54] in their Ministry the lever help the
[1:05:58] washing of the sacrifice and the lever
[1:06:01] also was for the washing of the priest
[1:06:04] one time in order to introduce them for
[1:06:07] their Ministry amen so all these three
[1:06:10] aspects that we spoke about on Wednesday
[1:06:12] were connected to the L amen everybody
[1:06:15] clear so far amen let's go to to
[1:06:18] Revelation chapter
[1:06:21] 4 hallelujah amen verse one the Bible
[1:06:25] say after this I look and behold a
[1:06:31] what so John saw a door open how did
[1:06:37] that door look
[1:06:39] like thank be to the name of the Lord
[1:06:42] amen a door was open in
[1:06:45] heaven and the first voice which I heard
[1:06:49] was as he were a trumpet talking to me
[1:06:53] which say come up here and I will show
[1:06:56] you things which must be Hereafter so a
[1:06:59] door open John need to enter Heaven and
[1:07:03] immediately I was in the spirit this is
[1:07:08] how he entered and behold a throne so
[1:07:11] when he got there the first thing that
[1:07:13] John saw was a throne you follow me is a
[1:07:18] throne that's number one he found a
[1:07:21] throne and I saw a throne
[1:07:25] was set in heaven and one sat on the
[1:07:28] throne somebody was there and he that
[1:07:31] sat was to look upon like Jasper and
[1:07:34] sish stone and there was a rainbow round
[1:07:36] about the throne in sight like an
[1:07:39] emerald this is deep teaching here but
[1:07:42] let me stay on the highway and round
[1:07:45] about The Throne were four and 24 and 20
[1:07:51] seat and upon the seat I saw for 4 and
[1:07:54] 20 Elders sitting clothed in the white
[1:07:58] Remnant everybody C Hallelujah and they
[1:08:03] had on their head crown of crown of gold
[1:08:07] verse five and out of the throne
[1:08:10] proceeding lightning and thundering and
[1:08:13] voices it's a throne of judgment and
[1:08:15] there were seven lamps of fire burning
[1:08:20] before the so according to John before
[1:08:25] the throne here we got seven lamps here
[1:08:28] that are burning yes everybody following
[1:08:32] me the
[1:08:34] Candlestick seven lamps that are burning
[1:08:37] over there before the throne which are
[1:08:40] the
[1:08:40] water which are the seven spirit of God
[1:08:45] the seven spirit of God everybody care
[1:08:48] and we know that God is
[1:08:52] one and everybody here and Paul said
[1:08:55] that by how many Spirit by one Spirit
[1:08:59] are you baptized into the
[1:09:02] water so there is only one Holy Ghost
[1:09:05] but brother Bram explained now to us
[1:09:08] because we need a prophet that he was
[1:09:11] one Holy Ghost but manifested into seven
[1:09:15] different way throughout the seven
[1:09:17] Church
[1:09:18] ages remember our camera is in heaven
[1:09:22] everybody here if if you notice in
[1:09:24] heaven here we don't have
[1:09:28] curtains is everybody okay there is no
[1:09:32] Veil you follow me blessed be the name
[1:09:36] of the Lord verse six and Before the
[1:09:39] Throne there was a sea of glass like to
[1:09:42] Crystal amen and in the midst of the
[1:09:47] throne and round about The Throne where
[1:09:50] four beasts full of eyes before and
[1:09:53] behind
[1:09:54] so we know now that before this seven
[1:09:58] Candlestick we have the sea of glass
[1:10:01] which Moses represented as a lever
[1:10:04] everybody
[1:10:05] clear but in between the
[1:10:09] throne and the Seven Candlestick we got
[1:10:12] four living
[1:10:15] creature everybody
[1:10:17] clear and we know the four living
[1:10:19] creature are
[1:10:22] what they are the Carib beims and they
[1:10:26] are what they are the for
[1:10:29] anointing maybe we need to go back to
[1:10:31] this that went through the church
[1:10:34] edges everybody
[1:10:37] here brother Bram help me a little bit
[1:10:39] on these
[1:10:40] four brother Bram says this in the
[1:10:43] message Revelation chapter 4 he said now
[1:10:46] remember God's guard of the Ark because
[1:10:49] when they made the Ark of the Covenant
[1:10:51] Moses put the carabin on top of them
[1:10:54] everybody clear because between the
[1:10:56] Carib beam was something that was called
[1:10:58] The Mercy Seat where God was going and
[1:11:01] sit there so The Mercy Seat represented
[1:11:04] the Throne of God then the caribbe him
[1:11:06] and so forth everybody here so when
[1:11:10] brother Bram say God's god of the ark or
[1:11:13] The Mercy Seat he say to how many John S
[1:11:18] how many four because one look like the
[1:11:22] lion one look like an ox one look like
[1:11:26] uh a man and another one look like a
[1:11:28] flying eagle how many did he see he seen
[1:11:32] four four living creature they both John
[1:11:38] and Moses both seen the same vision
[1:11:41] everybody clear when Moses went to
[1:11:43] heaven he saw the Carib beams when he
[1:11:46] came down he represented them upon the
[1:11:48] Ark of the Covenant and John went in
[1:11:51] heaven and saw the Carib beams and John
[1:11:53] say there are four of them and brother
[1:11:56] brandham say and four is the number of
[1:12:01] what
[1:12:03] four is a number of the earth so when we
[1:12:07] talk about four it's connected to the
[1:12:09] Earth amen if we have four living
[1:12:11] creature so those four living creature
[1:12:14] are connected to
[1:12:17] what I hope you okay okay blessed be the
[1:12:21] name of the Lord and four is the number
[1:12:23] of the earth did you know that how many
[1:12:26] knows now before we have to go into it
[1:12:29] four is a Earthly number sure like the
[1:12:35] four is not here give somebody the
[1:12:38] microphone everybody we have four
[1:12:41] Hebrews it's the Earth it's the number
[1:12:44] of the Earth the number of
[1:12:47] what so four is not only a number of the
[1:12:51] Earth but it is a number of Deliverance
[1:12:55] so when you have number four it means
[1:12:58] somebody on the earth need
[1:13:02] Deliverance everybody here there is
[1:13:04] somebody on the planet Earth that must
[1:13:07] be
[1:13:08] delivered amen everybody clear brother
[1:13:11] brandham continue he says now keep that
[1:13:14] in your mind Deliverance because I'm
[1:13:16] going to strick it just a minute real
[1:13:19] hard Deliverance now there was three
[1:13:22] Hebrew children in the fiery
[1:13:25] furnace but the fourth one come he was
[1:13:30] what Lazarus was in the grave three days
[1:13:34] but when the fourth one comes he was
[1:13:36] what so four is the number of what so
[1:13:41] when God begin to use number four it is
[1:13:44] an anointing that have to bring
[1:13:46] Deliverance to his
[1:13:49] children everybody here so four is God's
[1:13:53] number number of what and he showed that
[1:13:56] these beings these F creature must have
[1:13:59] been something about the so now in
[1:14:02] Heaven There is no curtain right here
[1:14:06] and the light that is coming from the
[1:14:08] throne is first shining on the four
[1:14:12] living
[1:14:14] creature are we okay I mean heaven I'm
[1:14:17] not on the earth in heaven God is
[1:14:21] sitting on the throne
[1:14:23] and God is sending his light do you
[1:14:27] follow me and that light first struck
[1:14:30] the four living
[1:14:33] creatures do you follow me and then when
[1:14:36] he struck the four living creature that
[1:14:39] light is transferred into the seven
[1:14:42] Candlestick
[1:14:44] am are we okay and when it transfer into
[1:14:48] the seven Candlestick then the seven
[1:14:51] Candlestick transfer the light to the
[1:14:54] sea of
[1:14:55] glass everybody here so the light that
[1:14:59] is tracking the water here is a light
[1:15:02] that is coming from the
[1:15:04] Candlestick and the light of the
[1:15:07] Candlestick is coming from the four
[1:15:09] Beast and the light of the four Beast is
[1:15:12] coming from the
[1:15:14] throne everybody here so we found out
[1:15:17] that number one is going into number
[1:15:20] four and number four is going into to
[1:15:23] number seven and then he struck the
[1:15:31] sea what are these seven spirit of
[1:15:35] God blessed be the name of the Lord in
[1:15:38] the message the S this church ages
[1:15:41] brother brandham say seven spirit and

[1:28:51] lever and this Veil here was called the
[1:28:55] door of the
[1:28:57] Tabernacle everybody care and we found
[1:29:00] out that John also before he entered
[1:29:04] into heaven there was also a
[1:29:07] door everybody here and we know that
[1:29:10] everything in the Tabernacle represent
[1:29:14] who and Jesus said I am the everybody K

[1:29:23] Sheepfold brother Bram say in orent they
[1:29:26] were not putting the door the door was a
[1:29:31] person so when you bring your sheep you
[1:29:35] put them into the fold and the shepherd
[1:29:38] himself was sleeping on the door so

[1:30:04] hallelujah
[1:30:06] hallelujah do you follow me as long as I
[1:30:10] am here I am blocking the light
[1:30:13] everybody here because the law came by
[1:30:16] Moses but Grace came by
[1:30:20] who our pillars have to come by Jesus
[1:30:25] Christ the pillars were holding the
[1:30:28] hanging of the veil showing that the
[1:30:31] door was the one connected to Grace
[1:30:35] Grace came by Jesus Christ who was the
[1:30:38] door but as long as Jesus Christ is
[1:30:41] there the seven Church ches cannot stop
[1:30:45] so when Christ is taken off when the
[1:30:49] veil is lift up when Christ go goes into
[1:30:52] the
[1:30:53] Rapture then the seven
[1:30:56] churches begin to shine their light into
[1:31:00] the
[1:31:01] water did I lose
[1:31:04] somebody did I lose
[1:31:06] somebody did I lose somebody as long as
[1:31:10] the veil the door Jesus Christ is here
[1:31:14] all D is connected to
[1:31:16] him he is the Fountain of the Living
[1:31:19] Water but we have building in the seven
[1:31:22] Church
[1:31:23] ages amen we have seven I mean we have
[1:31:27] seven Church ages that must start but
[1:31:30] for them to start Christ The Veil have
[1:31:34] to be lift
[1:31:36] upbody when the Val is lift up then the
[1:31:40] holy place is
[1:31:42] open then Grace is now
[1:31:45] open is open to the seven Church ages
[1:31:49] but that Grace goes to for those because
[1:31:53] there is for
[1:31:58] anointing everybody the Candlestick was
[1:32:03] behind the behind the
[1:32:06] column so when they lift up the veil do
[1:32:11] you follow me the light that was hidden
[1:32:15] have to go only through four
[1:32:19] doors did you follow me
[1:32:22] did you follow me the light that was
[1:32:25] hidden the light of the seven golden
[1:32:31] Candlestick the light the seven Golden
[1:32:33] cand Stick were here they have light
[1:32:37] these seven golden Candlestick light
[1:32:41] must grow only through four
[1:32:44] doors only through four car
[1:32:48] [Applause]
[1:32:50] bams so the first three messenger went
[1:32:54] to the first
[1:32:56] door Paul arus and Columba used the
[1:32:59] anointing of the lion they use the first
[1:33:02] door and then Columba used the second
[1:33:05] door and then Luther and Wesley luse the
[1:33:08] third door and the Flying Eagle is using
[1:33:11] the fourth
[1:33:13] one bringing grace to the Gentile Church
[1:33:17] ages because it's a number of
[1:33:20] Deliverance to the
[1:33:28] is everybody okay is everybody on
[1:33:31] board is everybody okay God is using the
[1:33:36] seven
[1:33:38] spirit amen through the seven Church
[1:33:41] ages but there is four anointing that
[1:33:43] work with them and giving grace to the
[1:33:46] Gentile Five Pillars holding the grace
[1:33:50] of God and exposing the light that's the
[1:33:52] light that struck the L that's the water
[1:33:55] that you need to take a bath with you
[1:33:58] must go in the word that is reflecting
[1:34:02] Grace under the anointing of your time
[1:34:06] that is the message that's going to
[1:34:08] prepare you wash you dress you and put
[1:34:11] you into the presence of the king
[1:34:15] Hallelujah any other water will kill
[1:34:20] you
[1:34:25] hallelujah
[1:34:27] hallelujah is everybody
[1:34:29] okay blessed be the name of the Lord did
[1:34:33] I lose
[1:34:35] anybody God say anoint the L that's why
[1:34:40] they have to put an anointing on the
[1:34:41] lever because that was on a physical to
[1:34:44] symbolize the Holy Ghost because in the
[1:34:47] heaven the Seven Angels were the
[1:34:50] anointing so mes must give you a symbol
[1:34:53] am
[1:34:54] everybody anoint the in his foot and
[1:34:58] sanctify it and that shall bring Aaron
[1:35:02] and his son unto the door of the
[1:35:05] Tabernacle you understand it now why the
[1:35:08] door of the Tabernacle because once they
[1:35:10] lift up the veil then the light is begin
[1:35:12] to shine over there everybody here
[1:35:15] remember the angel the light have to
[1:35:17] shine in a water for you to get healing
[1:35:20] that's why the Bible say I send my word
[1:35:22] and my word did
[1:35:25] what thank you Lord everybody and that
[1:35:28] shall bring Aaron and his son unto the
[1:35:31] door of the Tabernacle of the
[1:35:34] congregation and do what and wash them
[1:35:37] with water yes and that shall put upon
[1:35:41] Aaron holy garment amen and anoint him
[1:35:46] and sanctify him we're going to get to
[1:35:48] those garment that they may he may
[1:35:50] minist unto me in the priest's office
[1:35:54] and thou shall bring his son and clothe
[1:35:57] them with what the high priest have holy
[1:36:00] garment but the children of the high
[1:36:03] priest have
[1:36:06] coats okay thou shall anoint them as
[1:36:10] that did anoint their father the
[1:36:13] anointing is the same it's just the
[1:36:17] Garment that is different but the high
[1:36:20] priest is only one
[1:36:23] for their anointing shall be surely an
[1:36:26] everlasting priesthood throughout their
[1:36:28] generation now who's going to anoint the
[1:36:31] high priest who will wash the high
[1:36:34] priest and who will wash his children
[1:36:38] notice that the children of the high
[1:36:40] priest cannot be washed before the high
[1:36:44] priest everybody here the first to be
[1:36:48] washed must be the high priest first
[1:36:51] once the high priest is
[1:36:54] washed clothed anointed then every child
[1:36:59] of the high priest can go through the
[1:37:01] same
[1:37:02] process but to anoint the high priest of
[1:37:06] the first Covenant we need it a higher
[1:37:10] caliber Prophet am Hallelujah so the Lev
[1:37:16] of the Old Testament have to be coup
[1:37:19] with a prophet so when the high priest
[1:37:23] is coming there must be water and a
[1:37:28] prophet do you follow me the high priest
[1:37:32] word and a
[1:37:34] prophet am
[1:37:37] amen let's investigate that Prophet a
[1:37:40] little bit blessed be the name of the
[1:37:43] Lord the Bible says in number 26 verse
[1:37:47] 58 that these are the families of the
[1:37:50] lat
[1:37:51] the family of the liite the family of
[1:37:53] the heite the family of the malite the
[1:37:56] family of the mushat the family of the
[1:37:59] kti all of those are live God hides in
[1:38:03] genealogy everybody care and K begat
[1:38:10] amam we okay
[1:38:12] now if you sleeping wake up and the name
[1:38:17] of aram's wife was Sister yed
[1:38:24] everybody the daughter of L so right
[1:38:28] here yed is a
[1:38:32] l amam is a
[1:38:35] l so two Levi got married and have
[1:38:40] children what are their
[1:38:42] children the daughter of Levi whom her
[1:38:45] mother bear to Levi in Egypt and she
[1:38:48] bear unto them am unto am
[1:38:51] Aaron the high priest Moses the prophet
[1:38:56] and Miriam the sister of prophetes so
[1:39:00] the prophet that anointed the high
[1:39:03] priest was a
[1:39:06] levite everybody his mother a levite his
[1:39:11] father a
[1:39:13] levite 100%
[1:39:17] levite and amam took him yed his father
[1:39:21] sister to wife and she bear him Aaron
[1:39:24] and who Moes so we understand here that
[1:39:27] Moses was a levite purely 100% Lev from
[1:39:31] a family of Lev father Lev mother Lev
[1:39:35] that's the prophet that God used to
[1:39:38] introduce the high priest of the first
[1:39:43] Covenant everybody clear so far in 1
[1:39:47] Chronicle verse 20 uh chapter
[1:39:49] 23:3 there son of amram Aaron and Moses
[1:39:54] and Aaron was separated that he should
[1:39:56] sanctify the most holy place a for Holy
[1:39:59] for Holy things and his son forever they
[1:40:03] took them for the priesthood to burn
[1:40:05] ense before the Lord to minister unto
[1:40:07] him and to bless in his name forever now
[1:40:11] concerning Moses the man of God his son
[1:40:14] were name after of the tribe of Levi all
[1:40:17] of them l in Psalm 99 ver6 the Bible
[1:40:21] says Moses and Aaron among his what So
[1:40:25] Not only was this
[1:40:27] Prophet that anointed that have to uh to
[1:40:31] watch the first high priest Not only was
[1:40:34] he a
[1:40:35] levite Moses Moses was a levite
[1:40:39] everybody here and Moses was also a
[1:40:42] priest and Moses was also a
[1:40:46] prophet a prophet L
[1:40:49] priest
[1:40:52] to wash the high priest so not everybody
[1:40:55] can wash the high priest everybody clear
[1:40:58] so far blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:41:01] the Bible says in Num chapter 12 here he
[1:41:04] said if there be a prophet among you I
[1:41:08] the Lord will make myself known unto him
[1:41:11] in a vision and I will speak unto him in
[1:41:13] a dream my servant Moses is not so who
[1:41:18] is faithful in all man house with him
[1:41:21] will I speak
[1:41:24] how even apparently and not in dark
[1:41:28] speeches in other word when God talk to
[1:41:30] Moses he doesn't use code yes
[1:41:34] sir he talked to Moses
[1:41:36] straight and the similitud of the Lord
[1:41:39] shall he what so Moses had the right to
[1:41:43] see
[1:41:44] God
[1:41:46] hallu hallelujah everybody the Bible
[1:41:50] said nobody have seen God in any time
[1:41:53] only the only begotten have decare him
[1:41:57] but Moses had the right to enter and to
[1:42:01] put his eyes on God and nothing happened
[1:42:04] to Moses that's the prophet that can
[1:42:07] anoint the high
[1:42:11] priest everybody here and when God
[1:42:14] discuss with Moses they don't talk
[1:42:18] symbols plan amen amen hallelujah I will
[1:42:24] raise them up a prophet from among the
[1:42:27] Breen like unto
[1:42:29] who God is telling Moses I'm going to
[1:42:32] send a big Prophet but that Prophet will
[1:42:35] be like
[1:42:38] you hallelujah amen hallelujah
[1:42:41] Deuteronomy
[1:42:43] 34:10 and there arose not a prophet
[1:42:46] since in Israel like unto who whom the
[1:42:50] Lord knew
[1:42:52] how Moses and God were
[1:42:58] body everybody Hallelujah Moses was a
[1:43:03] levite Moses was a major prophet Moses
[1:43:07] was a priest and Moses caliber was so
[1:43:11] high until God gave him a permission to
[1:43:15] see
[1:43:16] him Hallelujah
[1:43:19] everybody and he's Ministry was so big
[1:43:23] until he was given the authority to

[1:58:39] olive
[1:58:40] trees and what and if Moses introduced
[1:58:44] the first levitical priesthood who's
[1:58:47] going to introduce the second
[1:58:50] [Applause]
[1:58:54] [Music]
[1:58:55] [Applause]
[1:58:56] [Music]
[1:59:00] one everybody here everybody here
[1:59:05] everybody clear my God blessed be the
[1:59:08] name of the Lord
[1:59:11] hallelujah now we found out that the the
[1:59:15] the levitical priesthood is introduced
[1:59:18] by a great prophet
[1:59:20] an anointed one on the right hand or
[1:59:23] left hand of God that's why when the son
[1:59:26] of zebede the the the M ask Jesus we
[1:59:30] want to be on the right side and the
[1:59:31] left side he
[1:59:33] say that one must be
[1:59:37] predestinated who thought those who Tau
[1:59:40] that mother that In Heaven There is a
[1:59:42] right side and a head
[1:59:47] side so Moses a levite Moses a priest
[1:59:52] Moses a prophet brought a great Covenant
[1:59:56] the law and introduce that
[1:59:59] law according to Hebrews 7: 19 the Bible
[2:00:03] said the law made nothing
[2:00:07] perfect oh brother
[2:00:09] stepen nothing so the law is
[2:00:14] worthless how can the law such a great
[2:00:17] command that have to be introduced by
[2:00:19] such a high caliber Prophet make nothing
[2:00:23] perfect is the LW worthless in Romans 7
[2:00:27] verse2 the Bible said the law is
[2:00:32] Holy and the Commandment holy and just
[2:00:36] and what you need
[2:00:39] it was then that which is good made
[2:00:43] death unto me Paul is asking you say
[2:00:46] it's good it's holy so how are we in the
[2:00:50] cha he say God forbid don't think like
[2:00:54] that but sin that IM appear
[2:00:58] what working death in Me by that which
[2:01:01] is
[2:01:02] what so the law sin was hidden in
[2:01:07] us that's correct do you follow me you
[2:01:11] follow me amen so when God want to shoot
[2:01:14] sin he's going to shoot
[2:01:17] you but God doesn't want to destroy you
[2:01:21] he's looking for
[2:01:22] sin and when he want to catch sin sin's
[2:01:25] hide on
[2:01:26] you do you follow me then God say don't
[2:01:29] worry I know what to do then God put the
[2:01:33] law do you follow me let me explain it
[2:01:36] again so he help you up do you follow
[2:01:41] me there is a glass and inside the glass
[2:01:45] there is a
[2:01:46] snake I need the glass but I don't want
[2:01:50] the
[2:01:51] snake if I'm caught up so much into the
[2:01:58] snake which the Lord
[2:02:02] did I will end up shooting the
[2:02:07] glass everybody here if they
[2:02:12] preaching he so up to the
[2:02:17] devil
[2:02:19] do you follow me they keep pointing sin
[2:02:22] all the time young people young people
[2:02:24] young people young people young people
[2:02:26] you will end up
[2:02:28] shooting and you're going to destroy the
[2:02:31] young
[2:02:32] people do you follow me he's just a
[2:02:36] glass he's anointed by something we need
[2:02:39] to find a way to get the snake
[2:02:44] out so we can recuperate the glass and
[2:02:47] shoot the snake
[2:02:52] do you hear me you hear me because that
[2:02:56] was the ministry of
[2:02:58] condemnation all the time banging on the
[2:03:01] people
[2:03:02] head you follow me so either you get
[2:03:06] caught up with the snake and you
[2:03:09] shoot they say what does the snake
[2:03:13] want what has the snake like he love to
[2:03:16] eat bird no problem
[2:03:19] they took a bird and they place it there
[2:03:22] outside the cup with a
[2:03:26] snake when the snake saw the
[2:03:30] bird the snake begin to forget about the
[2:03:34] glass he begin to pull his head off and
[2:03:38] show his color following
[2:03:42] the the bird not knowing that God is
[2:03:46] taking the glass
[2:03:47] off do you follow me once God take the
[2:03:51] glass
[2:03:52] off then the seed of the
[2:03:56] woman will crush the head of
[2:04:00] [Applause]
[2:04:02] the because the seed of the woman is
[2:04:05] coming but for him to crush the the
[2:04:08] promise in the Garden of Eden they said
[2:04:11] that the seed of the woman will crush
[2:04:13] the head of the serpent so the serpent
[2:04:15] must be out completely so when the seed
[2:04:19] come he can crush
[2:04:22] him do you follow me that's why Paul
[2:04:26] says that the law is good so what the
[2:04:30] law did the law brought the
[2:04:33] bird in other word the Lord did
[2:04:36] something to you to help sin bring its
[2:04:40] head
[2:04:42] upbody because when there is no
[2:04:45] law there's
[2:04:47] nothing
[2:04:49] amen do you follow me if a young child
[2:04:53] is born he can walk with
[2:04:56] diaper there's nothing to him because
[2:04:59] there's no law but if you tell him
[2:05:02] walking with diaper is a
[2:05:05] problem the law is activated then you're
[2:05:08] going to see the snake that was inside
[2:05:10] coming up now when he sees you he's
[2:05:13] watching you mom is there then he put
[2:05:15] the pain if Mom is not there because so
[2:05:19] that behavior was not before because he
[2:05:22] was unconscious of the law you follow me
[2:05:26] he become the law bring you
[2:05:28] consciousness of sin so sin take
[2:05:31] occasion and say oh they told you don't
[2:05:34] do this they thought you don't do this
[2:05:36] so now let me make you do that go ahead
[2:05:39] and do it go ahead and do it and the
[2:05:42] devil didn't understand that he was now
[2:05:44] pulling them one by
[2:05:46] one everybody and Moses take a pen and
[2:05:50] say what is that one
[2:05:52] stealing keep pulling keep squeeze them
[2:05:55] again uhhuh and another the demon
[2:05:56] squeeze them and the LA begin to take
[2:06:00] note let's
[2:06:02] continue he say but sin that he may
[2:06:06] appear what working death in me but that
[2:06:09] which is what that sin by the
[2:06:12] Commandment might become exceedingly
[2:06:15] what you see what I'm saying so by the
[2:06:18] Commandment the devil has been squeezed
[2:06:20] so much until he show up his color he
[2:06:24] said I hate you okay now we see who we
[2:06:27] dealing with because at the beginning
[2:06:30] God bless you God bless you she's a
[2:06:33] scent woman push her and pull the snake
[2:06:38] out that's why God put you in trouble to
[2:06:42] pull the snake out Hallelujah are you
[2:06:46] there and when something happened to you
[2:06:49] you get mad then the Holy Spirit say you
[2:06:52] see what you're still struggling with
[2:06:54] there is still a snake
[2:06:57] inside are you there then you take that
[2:07:00] snake you say God one was hidden this
[2:07:04] one kill
[2:07:08] him that's why Paul say I Die
[2:07:12] daily are you there when he pull a demon
[2:07:16] we slay him when he and the most slaying
[2:07:19] is going the more you are
[2:07:22] changing so your temptation is not what
[2:07:25] you're
[2:07:27] thinking are you there it is building a
[2:07:30] character
[2:07:33] [Music]
[2:07:37] hallelujah amen until when they shake
[2:07:41] you you don't move anymore then you are
[2:07:43] really
[2:07:47] dead Hallelujah
[2:07:49] they say that the Lord made nothing
[2:07:51] perfect but bringing in off a bed and
[2:07:55] what by the which we draw
[2:07:58] what so we could not Draw N to God in
[2:08:02] the old Tabernacle nobody enter there
[2:08:05] only the high priest if you enter there
[2:08:08] God kill
[2:08:09] you but what are we going to do we need
[2:08:11] something better that can put us in the
[2:08:14] presence of God because Isaiah was a
[2:08:17] prophet he went into heaven what
[2:08:19] happened block he found himself he was
[2:08:22] Heaven Sin they took Joshua the high
[2:08:24] priest in heaven filthy garment when
[2:08:27] every Old Testament died they can't go
[2:08:30] to heaven they have to go to paradise
[2:08:33] because something is blocking we need
[2:08:35] something better but the law was just
[2:08:38] telling them I'm giving you this
[2:08:40] temporarily let me pull the black dog
[2:08:43] out completely then I will handle him
[2:08:46] down the road everybody so far the Bible
[2:08:50] said the law having a shadow of
[2:08:54] what so it was a hope a shadow of good
[2:08:59] things to come and not the very image of
[2:09:03] things Moses only duplicated it but the
[2:09:06] true Tabernacle have to come down the
[2:09:08] high priest here was a representation of
[2:09:11] the high priest there so this one is
[2:09:14] only a representation but the true high
[2:09:17] priest have to
[2:09:19] come can never with those sacrifice
[2:09:23] which they offer year by year
[2:09:25] continually make the camer there on to
[2:09:29] what
[2:09:30] Hallelujah the Bible says this but
[2:09:34] before Faith
[2:09:36] came we were kept under the
[2:09:39] law shut up unto the faith which should
[2:09:43] afterward be revealed wherefore the law
[2:09:48] was
[2:09:49] our he was teaching you
[2:09:53] sin
[2:09:55] correct everybody the Lord was pointing
[2:09:59] you what sin is this is sin this is sin
[2:10:02] now you become aware of sin that's
[2:10:05] right he was our school Master to bring
[2:10:09] us onto what so the law was not
[2:10:13] bad he was just teaching you to bring
[2:10:16] you to Christ
[2:10:20] amen
[2:10:21] hallelujah one day there was a woman
[2:10:24] that was cheating on her husband that's
[2:10:28] right she keep doing that nobody catches
[2:10:31] her she sneak out on Facebook talk to

[2:10:56] the law everybody God permit an occasion
[2:11:01] for her to be

[2:18:23] time Hallelujah the Lord was a school
[2:18:27] Master to bring us unto Christ that we
[2:18:30] might be justified by faith but after
[2:18:33] that faith is come we are now no longer

[2:18:44] God by faith in Christ Jesus for as many
[2:18:48] of you as have been baptized into Christ
[2:18:51] have put on Christ there is neither Jew
[2:18:55] nor there is neither born nor free there
[2:18:58] is neither male nor female for ye are
[2:19:01] all one in Christ
[2:19:05] Jesus so Paul now is talking not to the
[2:19:08] Jews only now he's including
[2:19:13] everybody everybody here Moses was this
[2:19:15] is for the Jew everybody clear watch
[2:19:19] what's going on my God blessed be the
[2:19:23] name of the Lord the Bible says in
[2:19:26] Matthew
[2:19:27] 10:5 these 12 Jesus sent forth and
[2:19:31] commanded them saying go not into the
[2:19:34] way of
[2:19:37] the I still have time this kind of
[2:19:41] sermon you go like in
[2:19:43] eternity and when you come out you say
[2:19:45] wo we still okay you were somewhere in
[2:19:48] eternity everybody the first group you
[2:19:51] mention here is the Gentile everybody
[2:19:55] and into the city of the
[2:19:58] Samaritan everybody clear
[2:20:01] Samaritan but go right to the lost sheep
[2:20:05] of the House of what Israel so we got
[2:20:08] three groups here we got the Jews we got
[2:20:12] the Gentile and we got the Samaritan
[2:20:15] everybody so when Jesus Christ
[2:20:17] came he was
[2:20:19] restricted to the Jews only and he told
[2:20:23] his disciple don't go outside because
[2:20:26] the Covenant of Moses we got to stay
[2:20:29] inside everybody here everybody here but
[2:20:33] go rather to the lordship of the House
[2:20:35] of Israel now in John 1 verse1 the Bible
[2:20:39] say he came unto his own the Jews and
[2:20:43] his own receive him
[2:20:46] what
[2:20:48] so when he entered the door because
[2:20:50] Moses said the Lord your God will send
[2:20:52] the prophet like unto me so the Jews
[2:20:55] were expecting Jesus and when Jesus came
[2:20:59] the Jews rejected
[2:21:00] him
[2:21:02] everybody by rejection of the
[2:21:05] Jews another door
[2:21:09] open everybody everybody now the promise
[2:21:13] that was given to Israel to be a kingdom
[2:21:16] of
[2:21:18] priest everybody clear that promise now
[2:21:21] is leaving the Jews and it's going
[2:21:24] outside amen amen hallelujah you
[2:21:26] following me you following
[2:21:29] me amen what happened the Bible says
[2:21:34] that in John chapter 4 he must need go
[2:21:38] through what remember there was only the
[2:21:41] Jews now the door open Jesus goes to the
[2:21:45] Samaritan anybody care amen these three
[2:21:48] groups and then he came to the city to a
[2:21:51] city of Samaria which is called sasher
[2:21:53] near the parcel of the ground that Jacob
[2:21:55] gave to his son
[2:21:57] Joseph going down to the conversation
[2:22:00] Our Father Worship in this mountain and
[2:22:02] he say that in Jerusalem is the place
[2:22:05] where a man ought to worship because
[2:22:07] that's where the Salvation were supposed
[2:22:08] to come the Messiah Jesus say unto her
[2:22:11] woman believe me the hour cometh when
[2:22:14] you shall nether in this mountain
[2:22:16] Samaria
[2:22:17] nor yet in Jerusalem God chosen place of
[2:22:20] worship where the temple was worship the
[2:22:24] father ye worship you know not in other
[2:22:27] words you are
[2:22:29] ignorant you are just worshiping you
[2:22:31] don't understand amen we know what we
[2:22:34] worship for salvation is of the Jew
[2:22:36] that's where the place God chose amen
[2:22:39] verse 39 and many of the Samaritan of
[2:22:42] that City believed on him for the saying
[2:22:45] of the woman which testify she didn't
[2:22:47] preach she
[2:22:49] testify because this is what
[2:22:51] denominational uses he told me all that
[2:22:54] I ever did and when so when the
[2:22:57] Samaritan were come unto him they
[2:22:59] besought him for that he would ter with
[2:23:01] them and he there two days and many
[2:23:04] more believe because of his own word so
[2:23:07] we found out here there were people that
[2:23:10] believed Jesus in Israel there were
[2:23:12] people that believed Jesus in The
[2:23:14] Samaritan because the Samaritan were
[2:23:16] half Jews have Genta but there's a
[2:23:20] problem with the Gentile right amen
[2:23:23] because according to Revelation five out
[2:23:26] of every every tongue every God is going
[2:23:30] to make priest now God can make priest
[2:23:34] the Jews he can make Priest The
[2:23:36] Samaritan but there's still another fold
[2:23:39] that is not
[2:23:41] Incorporated everybody CLE I hope that
[2:23:44] is connected can you touch it again my
[2:23:46] brother the devil is wasting his
[2:23:49] time

[2:24:14] here uh-huh
[2:24:17] okay let's see what is coming
[2:24:22] up wasting time
[2:24:27] devil praise be the name of the Lord you
[2:24:30] might have to sit right there everybody
[2:24:32] clear let me scroll up quick because we
[2:24:36] already
[2:24:37] here right there all
[2:24:40] right we already went here we did this
[2:24:44] we did this ah that's right there in
[2:24:48] John chapter 10 verse 16 Jesus say and
[2:24:52] other sheep I have which are not of this
[2:24:55] fold everybody care which are not sure
[2:24:58] if so them also are must bring and they
[2:25:02] shall hear my voice and they shall
[2:25:05] be
[2:25:07] and so the ministry of Jesus Christ is
[2:25:11] to take the Jews the Gentile the
[2:25:15] Samaritan and gather everybody into one
[2:25:20] family with one Shepherd that's why he
[2:25:24] told them I have had a sheep that are
[2:25:26] outside they are not of this fold of the
[2:25:29] Jews I must bring them up so everybody
[2:25:32] might be onefold everybody here remember
[2:25:35] we have the Gentile the Samaritan and
[2:25:38] the Jews in Acts chapter one brother
[2:25:41] Kelly verse 8 the Bible say but ye shall
[2:25:44] receive power Jesus is dead he's
[2:25:48] resurrected now he's sending his
[2:25:50] disciple he say you shall receive power
[2:25:53] after the Holy Ghost is come upon you
[2:25:55] and ye shall be Witnesses unto me both
[2:25:59] in what Jews and in what Jews and in
[2:26:04] what Samaritan and unto
[2:26:07] the the door is
[2:26:11] open everybody here the door is now
[2:26:15] open that's why Jesus say in Matthew 28
[2:26:18] he said go ye therefore and do
[2:26:24] what you see now not only the Jews
[2:26:28] because MC
[2:26:31] Incorporated God Amen
[2:26:33] everybody everybody here all Nation
[2:26:37] teaching them Mark
[2:26:39] 16:15 and he says unto them go ye into
[2:26:43] what and do what to
[2:26:48] not only the Jews everybody here Luke 24
[2:26:52] and that repentance and remission of sin
[2:26:55] should be preached in his name among
[2:26:58] Nation beginning
[2:27:01] at everybody clear now the levitical
[2:27:05] priesthood was only restricted to the
[2:27:08] Jews but we need to go beyond the Jews
[2:27:12] we need to go and get all the children
[2:27:14] of God from everywhere they are and
[2:27:16] bring
[2:27:17] that's why we need a different
[2:27:19] priesthood that can incorporate
[2:27:23] everybody everybody C so far that
[2:27:29] priesthood in Genesis 14 we see a priest
[2:27:33] called meis EDC in Psalm 10 we see an
[2:27:38] unknown person called a priest like
[2:27:41] MC so to get more clarification on meis
[2:27:45] EDC let's go to Hebrews seven with
[2:27:48] Paul you okay
[2:27:50] now I have to stop
[2:27:53] somewhere okay give me time and I search
[2:27:56] for the
[2:27:58] airport for this
[2:28:01] madc king of
[2:28:04] Salem we saw that already priest of the
[2:28:08] most high God who met who why did meis
[2:28:12] EDC have to meet
[2:28:15] Abraham
[2:28:17] why Abraham why not somebody
[2:28:21] else
[2:28:23] Hallelujah Romans say that the law
[2:28:26] worketh R for where no law is there is
[2:28:30] no
[2:28:31] transgression therefore it is of faith
[2:28:34] that he might be by the Five Pillars to
[2:28:38] the end the promise might be sure to
[2:28:41] all yes sir if it's by law it is only
[2:28:44] the Jews yes but but we want everybody
[2:28:47] that is the seed of God to be recipient
[2:28:50] of the promise
[2:28:52] everybody not that only which is of the
[2:28:55] law the Jews but that which is also of
[2:28:58] the faith of who who is the father of as
[2:29:02] what that's why Paradise was the bosom
[2:29:06] of
[2:29:07] Abraham even though Adam was before
[2:29:13] Abraham did you hear me did me Abraham
[2:29:18] came later but the paradise took his
[2:29:24] name
[2:29:25] everybody Abraham who is the father of
[2:29:29] us all as it is written ah have made
[2:29:33] thee a father of what so Abraham was
[2:29:37] never the father of Israel
[2:29:41] only now it make sense usually when we
[2:29:44] say Abraham they Jew say our father
[2:29:48] Abraham God never told Abraham One
[2:29:51] Nation he said you are father of many
[2:29:54] Nation the Jews took them like it is
[2:29:57] Abraham our father but that was not the
[2:30:00] case so meis going to Every Nation must
[2:30:04] meet the father of every
[2:30:07] nation
[2:30:09] Hallelujah are we okay oh my
[2:30:13] God
[2:30:15] Amen the Bible say know ye therefore
[2:30:19] that they which are of what the same are
[2:30:22] the children of what so the children of
[2:30:25] Abraham are not the
[2:30:27] Jews certain Jews might be children of
[2:30:33] Abraham Hallelujah because Jesus Tau the
[2:30:37] Jew that if Abraham was your father you
[2:30:40] would not have SE to kill me you are of
[2:30:43] your father
[2:30:45] day
[2:30:49] everybody and the scripture everybody
[2:30:52] okay
[2:30:54] foreing that God the scripture
[2:30:57] understood that God would justify
[2:31:01] the the Gentile through what preach
[2:31:06] before the gospel to who saying inde
[2:31:10] Abraham shall what be what bless
[2:31:15] hallelujah amen
[2:31:19] if God would have put everything to the
[2:31:21] Jews we locked God put it on Abraham
[2:31:25] because Abraham was not
[2:31:27] Israel Israel came after
[2:31:31] Jacob and Abraham was not even
[2:31:39] circumcised Abraham was a ad
[2:31:43] [Music]
[2:31:44] worshiper he has no God
[2:31:51] Hallelujah so then they which be of
[2:31:54] Faith are blessed with the faithful what
[2:31:57] now Abraham and he Seed where the
[2:31:59] promise is made he said not to seeds as
[2:32:03] of what but as of what and that seed
[2:32:07] which is who that's why M came to
[2:32:12] him because this
[2:32:14] Covenant I can not I cannot deal that
[2:32:18] with the Jew I have to deal that with
[2:32:21] somebody who's not
[2:32:24] Jew Hallelujah
[2:32:27] Hallelujah
[2:32:28] Hallelujah
[2:32:30] Hallelujah the Bible says Abraham
[2:32:33] returning from the slaughter of the king
[2:32:36] and bless
[2:32:38] him to whom also Abraham gave a 10th
[2:32:42] part of all first being by inter
[2:32:46] interpretation
[2:32:48] what so MC means
[2:32:54] what so when you dealing with melis EDC
[2:32:58] the first
[2:32:59] interpretation is king of
[2:33:02] what king of
[2:33:04] righteousness first yeah so when meis
[2:33:08] comes then first thing that come up is
[2:33:11] righteousness everybody care king of
[2:33:14] righteousness and after that
[2:33:17] also king of what which is
[2:33:23] what so
[2:33:25] MC have two things in
[2:33:28] him he have
[2:33:30] righteousness and he has peace are we
[2:33:35] okay
[2:33:36] MC is Jehovah
[2:33:41] [Music]
[2:33:42] Chen the Lord my
[2:33:45] righteousness mix with Jehovah
[2:33:49] Shalom the Lord my
[2:33:53] peace everybody so you have the
[2:33:57] righteousness of
[2:33:58] God which is mixed with the peace of God
[2:34:03] that's why uh David say righteousness
[2:34:07] and peace have done what kiss each other
[2:34:10] it's in the
[2:34:11] PSAL everybody because the righteousness
[2:34:15] of God something
[2:34:16] produces
[2:34:22] wrath the righteousness of God sometime
[2:34:25] produces
[2:34:28] punishment everybody care everybody care
[2:34:32] the
[2:34:34] punishment but that punishment of
[2:34:42] Peace but Robert you got it can you say
[2:34:45] loud yes the chastisement of
[2:34:51] Peace was
[2:34:56] [Applause]
[2:34:59] upon who is this meis
[2:35:02] EDC hallelujah king of peace

[2:46:56] God everybody okay no so far in John
[2:47:01] 58 therefore the Jews sought the more to

[2:47:38] priest of Heaven Is God he's melis EDC
[2:47:41] he's the father of Jesus Christ but we
[2:47:44] need the priest that can take care of us
[2:47:47] so we can enter in the presence of
[2:47:49] God Amen when we teste MEC MC can
[2:47:57] disappear go tell MEC I have a headache
[2:48:01] he doesn't understand
[2:48:04] headache amen M cannot understand
[2:48:08] Heaven amen because melis EDC doesn't
[2:48:13] eat he can't get
[2:48:16] hungry amen but we saw somebody who
[2:48:19] fasted 40 days and he got hungry so when
[2:48:23] I say I'm hungry he remember when he
[2:48:30] fasted let me head to the airport God
[2:48:33] could not suffer in the spirit he had to
[2:48:37] become to feel the pain of sickness to
[2:48:41] feel the temptation of last to feel the
[2:48:44] temptation of want to feel the
[2:48:46] temptation of hunger to feel the power
[2:48:49] of death that he might take it upon
[2:48:51] himself to stand in the presence of the
[2:48:54] great spirit Jehovah the spirit not the
[2:48:57] man the spirit to make intercession to
[2:48:59] this life and Jesus took that in order
[2:49:03] to make intercession for us for he knows
[2:49:06] how he feels when you get sick he knows
[2:49:09] how you feel when you are tempted he
[2:49:12] knows how you
[2:49:13] feel
[2:49:15] amen
[2:49:17] hallelujah God coming down to become man
[2:49:21] to die could not die as a spirit because
[2:49:26] he could not die he is eternal and he
[2:49:29] could not die but God could make himself
[2:49:31] in such a way that he could feel pain
[2:49:35] and he could feel and suffer God could
[2:49:38] not suffer as the eternal spirit but
[2:49:41] when he become man he could suffer feel
[2:49:44] the pain and the Temptation that man
[2:49:46] went through like Adam and Eve in the
[2:49:48] Garden of Eden and everyone ceas
[2:49:52] everybody
[2:49:53] clear that's all he asked just leave it
[2:49:56] there he is our high priest standing
[2:49:58] here that knows how you feel and he
[2:50:01] knows how to reconcile you back to Grace
[2:50:04] how to bring you back to your health he
[2:50:06] knows all about it he suffered when you
[2:50:09] have not got a place to lay your head he
[2:50:11] had the same when you got one change of
[2:50:14] clothes he had the same when you are
[2:50:17] made fun of it persecuted he has the
[2:50:20] same so God needed a body that he can
[2:50:24] live like you and me because the first
[2:50:27] high priest was human the second one
[2:50:29] must be
[2:50:31] human how is he going to be human Hebrew
[2:50:34] 10 when he cometh into the word he says
[2:50:37] sacrifice and offering that W is not but
[2:50:40] a body has that prepare me that's why
[2:50:44] they great eternal spirit who imorph
[2:50:48] himself in the pillar of fire later on
[2:50:51] IM morph himself and get into a man and
[2:50:55] that man was called the Lord Jesus
[2:50:57] Christ which is Emmanuel God With as now
[2:51:02] we find somebody that come down and he's
[2:51:09] God but this God can have a
[2:51:13] headache
[2:51:16] Hallelujah this God can get tired
[2:51:19] Hallelujah this God can
[2:51:24] cry this God can feel
[2:51:29] hunger if you beat him he hurt
[2:51:37] [Music]
[2:51:38] him amen am he is Emmanuel we found out
[2:51:43] on Wednesday that he was the temple of
[2:51:46] God but if the temple comes with a high
[2:51:51] priest we must take that high priest and
[2:51:54] wash him who's going to wash
[2:52:03] him Moses already was Aon Moses was a
[2:52:08] priest a levite a major prophet one of
[2:52:12] the anointing on the right hand
[2:52:16] somebody else must come and that person
[2:52:19] must be a levite a son of the levite
[2:52:23] himself a priest himself a prophet and
[2:52:26] he himself must be one of the
[2:52:30] anointing because we have to watch the
[2:52:32] high priest before he start his
[2:52:36] ministry the high priest must
[2:52:43] be amen
[2:52:46] let's
[2:53:03] stand why are you going through all of
[2:53:06] this you need to understand that there
[2:53:10] is somebody who took care of your
[2:53:13] problem
[2:53:15] amen there's somebody who took care of
[2:53:18] your
[2:53:19] problem if Israel could stand in their
[2:53:24] places
[2:53:25] there and be under anxiety because the
[2:53:28] high priest is gone and every year their
[2:53:32] their blood pressure have to go up in
[2:53:35] Yumer in the day of atonement because if
[2:53:38] the atonement is not received they in
[2:53:40] trouble their high blood pressure was up
[2:53:43] they have to wait wait for the priest to
[2:53:45] enter and the priest to finish and come
[2:53:47] and say this year it's over so for the
[2:53:50] rest of the year they are they are
[2:53:52] covered and then next year they got to
[2:53:55] wait for the another high priest to go
[2:53:56] in there but we don't have to do
[2:53:59] that for all once for all if Israel
[2:54:04] could sleep in peace because a human
[2:54:08] high priest under the law that could not
[2:54:11] make anything
[2:54:12] perfect could bring peace and safety and
[2:54:16] calm to Israel when their sin were not
[2:54:19] even
[2:54:20] remitted what can the New Covenant do to
[2:54:28] us so if a Jew look at you being trouble
[2:54:31] with all of this his mind is puzzled
[2:54:34] because you got the real deal yes yes
[2:54:37] sir he got the substitute the law the
[2:54:40] Shadow and Israel was strong with the
[2:54:43] shadow until today they still climing
[2:54:46] under the
[2:54:47] shadow which was only a hope of better
[2:54:50] things how much more the real thing
[2:54:54] let's pray Heavenly Father Lord we
[2:54:58] approaching you again humbly this
[2:54:59] morning thankfully Lord father thanking
[2:55:02] you for the New and Living Way that you
[2:55:06] have opened through US Lord father

[2:55:12] to us that he was your body
[2:55:14] body this body that was
[2:55:17] lacerated this body that was beaten this
[2:55:21] body that is speed on this body that was
[2:55:24] ridiculed
[2:55:26] persecuted carry
[2:55:28] everything that we can be as shame of on
[2:55:31] this world and even hung naked at the
[2:55:34] cross father you took all of them so
[2:55:38] that we can be spared from your judgment
[2:55:42] Lord because you are the king king of

[2:55:47] Justice upon
[2:55:49] yourself the chastisement Lord father of

[2:57:11] kind of infirmities they didn't even
[2:57:13] need the doctor diagnosis all they have
