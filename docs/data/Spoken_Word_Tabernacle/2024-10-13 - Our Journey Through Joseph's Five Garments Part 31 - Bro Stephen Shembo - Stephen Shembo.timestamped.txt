[1:02:29] while Jesus pushed the
[1:02:31] break he say Satan you shall not
[1:02:36] tent the
[1:02:39] Lord your
[1:02:44] God in other words you've been playing
[1:02:47] games so much I want you to understand
[1:02:50] something I'm a human being but I'm
[1:02:54] almighty God
[1:02:56] I'm a human being but I'm the creator of
[1:02:59] Heaven and Earth I'm a human being but
[1:03:02] I'm the one who created you you are
[1:03:06] existing because of me so remember who
[1:03:09] the boss is you shall not tempt the
[1:03:13] Lord your
[1:03:18] God so you need to reach a point where
[1:03:21] you tell the devil you shall not judge
[1:03:25] [Applause]
[1:03:32] he is king of what and he is Lord of
[1:03:36] what so you cannot tempt the
[1:03:41] Lord I'm I'm waiting for that to so in
[1:03:45] your
[1:03:47] God you need to reach a point where you
[1:03:50] tell the devil you cannot judge me I am
[1:03:54] only judged by
[1:03:59] [Music]
[1:04:02] God don't worry my friend we will get
[1:04:05] there by God's grace we will get there
[1:04:07] don't worry my friend we will get there
[1:04:10] by God's grace jump to verse six if you
[1:04:14] can Oh Glory to
[1:04:17] God verse 6 say we got two records there
[1:04:22] you understand this clearly now I have
[1:04:25] said
[1:04:26] ye are
[1:04:28] gods and all of you are children of the
[1:04:32] most high God the most high amen but you
[1:04:37] know what he does you shall die like men
[1:04:42] and fall like one of the princes we
[1:04:45] found out that according to verse six we
[1:04:48] got a Divine record you remember that
[1:04:51] one and the Divine record have no
[1:04:54] trouble amen no problem no
[1:04:58] mistake no
[1:05:01] sins let me put that one day amen and on
[1:05:05] verse seven you got the natural record
[1:05:08] that's why God said but you shall die
[1:05:12] die death was introduced because of sin
[1:05:15] the day you eat thereof that day you
[1:05:17] shall die so it's sin that introduces
[1:05:20] death that's why Paul say death is the
[1:05:23] Wage of Sin are we clear the second
[1:05:26] record got difficulties trouble trials
[1:05:30] mistake and all kind of stuff are we to
[1:05:33] are we together so the first record is a
[1:05:37] positive
[1:05:39] [Music]
[1:05:44] record the first record have no trouble
[1:05:48] it's clear it is clean amen no problem
[1:05:53] no mistake amen no sickness amen no sin
[1:05:58] amen is he negative or positive POS it's
[1:06:01] a positive record we clear now the next
[1:06:06] one is a record that have all kind of
[1:06:10] trial trouble fall sins death
[1:06:14] difficulties crying everything is it a
[1:06:17] positive or A negative negative so we
[1:06:20] got a positive record and a negative
[1:06:23] record are we together brother Bram says
[1:06:26] this in the message God has a provided
[1:06:29] way we already pray my friend but to
[1:06:32] think this morning above all things that
[1:06:35] we have a loving savior who does what
[1:06:40] who loved us and care for us and know
[1:06:43] that this great tremendous task that we
[1:06:46] are going through and
[1:06:49] times and
[1:06:51] strength that we are is just the
[1:06:55] positive part of this
[1:06:57] [Applause]
[1:06:59] journey it is
[1:07:01] what so whatever you going through is a
[1:07:04] negative part of the journey I'm reading
[1:07:07] brother Bram now can you say Amen
[1:07:10] brother Bram says this again he says
[1:07:13] this is what we call life
[1:07:17] now amen is only a
[1:07:22] shadow or what so so this second record
[1:07:27] here brother Bram called that a
[1:07:31] shadow in other word it's not even the
[1:07:36] truth amen it's not the
[1:07:42] truth I know where to get you my friend
[1:07:45] don't worry it's not the truth amen we
[1:07:48] all like to
[1:07:50] Rejoice but we can Rejoice over the
[1:07:53] right thing
[1:07:55] that shows that we are hooked up with
[1:07:59] what when we Rejoice of a what brother
[1:08:04] Bram say when you rejoice over something
[1:08:07] that is right it shows that you are
[1:08:10] connected with what is right when we
[1:08:13] preach the word in the church and you
[1:08:16] are rejoicing over the word of God which
[1:08:20] is the right thing it shows that you and
[1:08:23] the word are connected
[1:08:25] [Applause]
[1:08:27] that's why you need to be careful being
[1:08:29] in church and sitting like this and not
[1:08:32] saying Amen to the word because brother
[1:08:35] Bram say when the right thing is coming
[1:08:37] up you must Rejoice over
[1:08:41] it if God Save Somebody you must be a
[1:08:45] you must be joyful about it if God heals
[1:08:49] somebody he must create Joy whatever is
[1:08:53] right is the source of your happiness
[1:08:55] [Applause]
[1:08:57] are we together are we together brother
[1:09:01] Bram say
[1:09:02] but when we Rejoice over the wrong
[1:09:06] thing it shows we are hooked up with the
[1:09:10] what so our life can tell right now what
[1:09:15] we are which way our emotion are doing
[1:09:19] what so whatever way you going you will
[1:09:23] know who you are that's why God judges
[1:09:27] you by your heart you might make a
[1:09:30] mistake on the outside but as long as
[1:09:33] your heart is learning for the right
[1:09:35] thing you know that I'm a Son of God I'm
[1:09:39] a Child of God I'm a child of the king
[1:09:43] because in me there is nothing wrong
[1:09:45] about me there is something about me
[1:09:48] that loves God that love to go to church
[1:09:52] that love to worship Him
[1:09:56] are we together are we together glory to
[1:10:01] God brother Bram says this that we
[1:10:04] realize that we are here in a negative
[1:10:07] form second record my friend and as long
[1:10:11] as there is a
[1:10:14] negative there has to be a what and our
[1:10:17] positive form is the
[1:10:21] D they cannot be a negative
[1:10:26] without a positive because it's because
[1:10:30] of the positive that makes
[1:10:36] what it is the
[1:10:39] positive that makes the
[1:10:43] negative it is the positive that
[1:10:48] create that's fine you will catch it up
[1:10:51] amen like you had a negative picture of
[1:10:55] some object there has to be an object
[1:10:58] somewhere or to strick the light strick
[1:11:01] that l or the would not be any negative
[1:11:05] so when we see our life
[1:11:08] here is in the what and knowing that we
[1:11:13] are the image of some life
[1:11:16] where then we know that there is
[1:11:20] a somewhere that the light has what and
[1:11:24] it's reflected something here where
[1:11:28] remember before the foundation of the
[1:11:30] word you used to praise God and when you
[1:11:33] get the connection back with your
[1:11:36] positive with your
[1:11:38] theop that's why brother Bram say when
[1:11:41] you recognize this message to be ego
[1:11:43] food you heard from your theop you heard
[1:11:47] from your
[1:11:50] [Applause]
[1:11:52] positive Hallelujah he says that there
[1:11:56] is the positive somewhere that the light
[1:11:59] has struck and it reflected something
[1:12:02] here on Earth and we are only
[1:12:05] what the genuine object is where
[1:12:09] somewhere so the true
[1:12:13] you is
[1:12:17] [Applause]
[1:12:19] God we already crossed this my friend
[1:12:22] you should be happy now the true you is
[1:12:25] go this one is a man that was given five
[1:12:31] CES like a bear or a
[1:12:34] monkey are we together but if you take
[1:12:37] the image of a bear and my image and you
[1:12:41] begin to bring them together it won't
[1:12:43] blend
[1:12:48] together are we together are we together
[1:12:52] are we together when the positive and
[1:12:55] the negative Mi together it is called
[1:12:59] the word made
[1:13:01] [Applause]
[1:13:04] flesh I hope I hope we okay I hope we
[1:13:08] okay the positive is the D part the
[1:13:12] positive is the word and the negative is
[1:13:16] the flesh it is your body and when the
[1:13:20] positive enter the negative when the
[1:13:24] word in the beginning was the word and
[1:13:27] the Word was with God and the Word was
[1:13:31] God and the Word was made the positive
[1:13:35] become and the two become
[1:13:40] what that's when you tell the devil you
[1:13:43] shall not tempt the Lord your God
[1:13:47] because I'm a human being
[1:13:49] 100% but I'm also God
[1:13:53] [Applause]
[1:13:57] are we together are we together are we
[1:14:01] together and we are living in the age
[1:14:05] where the positive have to become the
[1:14:08] [Music]
[1:14:10] [Applause]
[1:14:11] [Music]
[1:14:12] negative remember you cannot have this
[1:14:15] in the time of Paul no AG this that's
[1:14:20] why the one who overcome in this age
[1:14:23] will sit on the throne
[1:14:26] [Music]
[1:14:27] [Applause]

[1:25:33] question to the positive if you be the
[1:25:36] Son of
[1:25:37] God which he was already the Son of God

[1:33:49] amen Oh Glory Glory Hallelujah
[1:33:54] amen amen
[1:33:59] amen remember to win amalik you look at
[1:34:02] the
[1:34:04] hill Amen to overcome baac and
[1:34:08] B you need the BR Serpent and the
[1:34:11] smithing rock all of those are just
[1:34:13] Calvary Calvary
[1:34:16] Calvary when Israel begin to fight Amal
[1:34:19] Moses expressed the calvary
[1:34:24] because Amal attacked from the
[1:34:27] back amen he attack you when you are
[1:34:30] weak just like he attacked Jesus Christ
[1:34:33] when he was weak in other words he will
[1:34:36] never attack this record right here only
[1:34:39] the natural record because that is where
[1:34:42] your negative is are we together let's
[1:34:46] go to Luke chapter 15 if you thereare
[1:34:48] you you can say amen amen by Luke 15 we
[1:34:51] already established three records are we
[1:34:53] together
[1:34:54] before the Child leave home he leave a
[1:34:57] life
[1:34:58] there amen then when he left home
[1:35:03] everybody is acquainted to this life
[1:35:05] everybody everyone who been in church
[1:35:08] all over the world knows about this bad
[1:35:10] record here everybody know do you know
[1:35:12] the prodal son do you know the prodal
[1:35:14] son what comes with the prodal son the
[1:35:16] first thing he went and took the money
[1:35:18] and everybody remember that one this is
[1:35:21] the record right here then there is
[1:35:23] another record when he came back and the
[1:35:26] judge became the attorney or the
[1:35:29] lawyer are we together the
[1:35:34] attorney so whichever word you want to
[1:35:36] use amen jum to verse uh 17 and when he
[1:35:41] came to himself how many hired servant
[1:35:44] of my father have what bread enough and
[1:35:48] to spare and I perish with Hunger I will
[1:35:51] arise and go to my mother
[1:35:54] you know what it means now to my father
[1:35:57] and will say to him father I have Sinn
[1:36:00] against heaven and before you and I am
[1:36:04] no more worthy to be called your son you
[1:36:06] know what it means make me as one of
[1:36:09] your hired servant and he arose and came
[1:36:12] to his father but when he was yet a
[1:36:15] great way
[1:36:17] off his father saw him and had
[1:36:22] compassion and r
[1:36:24] and fell on his neck and kissed him he
[1:36:26] took his sin away so the father was the
[1:36:28] atonement and the son say
[1:36:31] father I have sinned against heaven and
[1:36:35] in your sight and I'm no more worthy to
[1:36:37] be called your son but the father said
[1:36:40] to his servant bring forth the bom and
[1:36:44] put it on him on the criminal and put a
[1:36:47] ring on his hand and Sho on his feet
[1:36:51] let's stop right there let me pull this
[1:36:54] so we can climb higher now amen in
[1:36:57] Malachi 3 we found out that there is two
[1:37:01] kind of people there we got those that
[1:37:04] serve God Amen and that are keeping his
[1:37:08] ordinances and we also got the
[1:37:11] wicked amen and those that work
[1:37:14] wickedness so we got good
[1:37:18] deeds Good
[1:37:20] Deeds
[1:37:21] amen versus bad
[1:37:25] did amen the good deed here they are
[1:37:29] serving
[1:37:30] God they are keeping his
[1:37:33] commandment amen amen the bad one these
[1:37:37] are
[1:37:39] wicked they are
[1:37:42] proud the Bible says that uh they even
[1:37:45] tempt
[1:37:47] God Amen the problem is we expect this
[1:37:52] side here
[1:37:54] to be
[1:37:57] happy amen but for some reason looking
[1:38:01] on
[1:38:02] Earth it turned out that it's the
[1:38:05] opposite amen we found out that the sad
[1:38:09] part was this side right here and the
[1:38:13] happy part was the other side over there
[1:38:16] and because of this the book of
[1:38:19] remembrance open
[1:38:21] up or the book of memory open up are we
[1:38:25] together are we together brother Bram
[1:38:28] said there was a time me and you
[1:38:32] knew the only one who remain consistent
[1:38:36] with his knowledge is God but because we
[1:38:39] byass
[1:38:40] our now we forgot stuff are we together
[1:38:44] I'm skipping quickly so we can go it's
[1:38:46] just a quick review brother Bram say we
[1:38:49] me and you we can forgive but we don't
[1:38:52] forget but God can both
[1:38:55] forgive amen God can
[1:39:00] forgive and God can forget and brother
[1:39:03] Bram say I'm happy with
[1:39:07] this amen why did Brother Bram say he's
[1:39:12] happy with that back up my friend in
[1:39:16] Revelation 20 follow me carefully now my
[1:39:19] friend when we read Revelation 20 go
[1:39:22] ahead my friend
[1:39:25] Revelation 20 yeah it's right there
[1:39:28] verse 11 you can read it and I saw a
[1:39:30] great white he say I saw a great white
[1:39:33] Throne we found out that both Daniel and
[1:39:37] John saw the same thing you remember
[1:39:41] that when Daniel saw it God was not
[1:39:47] alone you remember that he was God plus
[1:39:51] a multitude of people thousands times
[1:39:54] thousand you know what happened amen but
[1:39:57] when John saw him he's
[1:40:04] alone amen but we know that the bride is
[1:40:09] somewhere yes sir because it's the same
[1:40:11] SC and John say I saw a great white
[1:40:15] throne and him that s on it I did this
[1:40:18] so you don't have to turn around turn
[1:40:20] the uh back to that from whose face the
[1:40:23] earth and the heaven fled away and there
[1:40:26] was found no place for
[1:40:28] them and I saw the dead how small and
[1:40:34] great when John saw these dead
[1:40:38] people the Bible say the dead were small
[1:40:42] and they were great in other words he
[1:40:46] was every
[1:40:51] age amen let me call this
[1:40:56] young and
[1:40:59] old are we together he saw them in
[1:41:04] different ages follow me carefully stand
[1:41:08] before God and the books were
[1:41:11] open amen we got books
[1:41:15] plural remember that one and this is
[1:41:19] different than the book of life we
[1:41:22] already established that last Sunday
[1:41:24] right am amen he says and the books were
[1:41:29] open and another book singular we clear
[1:41:34] was open which is the what book of life
[1:41:37] so it's two separate amen many books and
[1:41:41] the Book of Life and the
[1:41:43] dead the small and great Are We There
[1:41:48] were judged out of those things which
[1:41:51] were written in the book of life because
[1:41:54] the Book of Life only contain names are
[1:41:58] we
[1:41:59] clear The Book of Life only contain
[1:42:02] names but these books contain
[1:42:06] things amen and they contain
[1:42:09] works and they were judging people based
[1:42:13] on that amen and the Bible says and the
[1:42:16] Sea gave up the dead which were in it
[1:42:20] and death and Hell
[1:42:24] deliver up the dead which were how in
[1:42:28] when somebody is coming from hell is he
[1:42:30] a seed of God keep that and they were
[1:42:34] judg every man according to their what
[1:42:39] word so every book was a record of
[1:42:43] somebody are we together but what I'm
[1:42:47] trying to show you here is John say that
[1:42:50] the dead were small and great
[1:42:55] brother Bram says in the message
[1:42:58] in when Jesus
[1:43:00] died he goes up down there I can see him
[1:43:05] on Friday afternoon after his death
[1:43:08] brother Bram knocks knock on the door of
[1:43:12] the region of the
[1:43:15] Lost amen let's follow him a minute the
[1:43:19] door
[1:43:20] opens amen there was women come on there
[1:43:26] was Men come on there were what young
[1:43:31] ladies and they were what
[1:43:36] old they were all together in that Hest
[1:43:40] place called the prison of what lost
[1:43:43] souls so in
[1:43:47] Hell people that goes to
[1:43:49] hell have different ages
[1:43:53] amen I told you to put your seat belt my
[1:43:57] friend because if you die as a
[1:44:00] sinner whichever age you die is the way
[1:44:05] you going over
[1:44:07] there are you following me if you die 18
[1:44:11] years old if we go to hell we find you
[1:44:14] 18 years old if you die at 79 years old
[1:44:19] if we go to hell you are still 79 years
[1:44:22] old
[1:44:23] that's why in the white great Throne
[1:44:26] when they day that deliver up they are
[1:44:29] coming up with different
[1:44:32] ages the prophet and the Bible are
[1:44:35] perfectly in
[1:44:38] line are we together but thank God there
[1:44:42] is another region which is the sixth
[1:44:45] dimension of the region of the sa over
[1:44:50] there everybody that goes there have the
[1:44:53] same
[1:44:59] AG if you die 8 years old and you are
[1:45:04] bad if you die 12 13 years old you are
[1:45:08] bad you going to
[1:45:10] hell and in hell you will be 13 years
[1:45:13] old when you come back for judgment you
[1:45:16] 13 years
[1:45:20] old but there is a mystery when God
[1:45:24] created
[1:45:25] Adam he never created him a
[1:45:34] baby Adam was not an old
[1:45:38] man Adam was at the age that he can
[1:45:42] marry so God created a
[1:45:46] [Applause]
[1:45:49] youth from the dust of the ground which
[1:45:53] was a
[1:45:55] preview because those that are going in
[1:45:57] the sixth Dimension are not going to be
[1:46:00] old they're not going to be younger
[1:46:03] brother Bram babies die but when brother
[1:46:06] Bram saw the baby he was a
[1:46:09] [Applause]
[1:46:16] grown there are stuff that are leaking
[1:46:19] in but I'm trying to stay out amen amen
[1:46:23] the baby did not really reflect the
[1:46:26] theophany but it didn't change the
[1:46:31] theophany the baby died baby but when
[1:46:34] you see the baby it's back again in the
[1:46:38] theophany sometime you might die a 90
[1:46:41] years old but when you get there the
[1:46:44] theop will
[1:46:46] accommodate they will manage to bring
[1:46:49] you down if you a baby they bring you up
[1:46:53] if you an old man they bring you down
[1:46:55] because there is only one door one
[1:46:59] entrance one
[1:47:02] [Applause]
[1:47:04] Edge Have I Lost somebody have I lost
[1:47:08] somebody have I lost somebody have I
[1:47:11] lost somebody so if we go back to our
[1:47:14] reading here we found out that the small
[1:47:17] and great comes from
[1:47:20] hell are we there and they were judged
[1:47:24] by
[1:47:26] books we okay now we okay now we okay
[1:47:30] now but when we saw last Sunday amen we
[1:47:34] found out that when brother Bram
[1:47:36] interpret the books brother brandham say
[1:47:39] books
[1:47:41] plural was open and every man was judged
[1:47:46] out of those
[1:47:48] books the things were written therein
[1:47:51] you remember last Sunday that's why I
[1:47:53] usually say keep up with the sermon and
[1:47:56] brother Bram said look the books were
[1:48:00] open he saw him coming and 10,000 times
[1:48:05] 10,000 ministering to him sent come with
[1:48:10] him is that right in Daniel and the
[1:48:14] books were open books plural brother
[1:48:18] Bram say those books that is the book of
[1:48:22] your life

[1:57:03] two
[1:57:09] sections are we together are we together
[1:57:13] it's a book let me do this so it makes
[1:57:16] sense there it's a book that look like
[1:57:19] this amen amen and there is a section
[1:57:23] here this whole thing is The Book of
[1:57:26] Life amen but there is a little section
[1:57:30] called the

[1:57:50] who the life of the Lamb if you want to
[1:57:54] know the life of the Lamb you get there

[1:58:25] saved we need to make sure they are in
[1:58:28] the record before they go into
[1:58:32] heaven because if you don't go to the
[1:58:34] heaven you go into the Lake of Fire only
[1:58:37] two
[1:58:38] [Applause]
[1:58:39] [Laughter]
[1:58:41] choices he says you see the message of
[1:58:44] the hour people think we have to preach
[1:58:47] Jesus save you from the sin it's true we
[1:58:50] save that we preach that we need to
[1:58:52] preach that but the message got a meat
[1:58:56] when you begin to preach
[1:58:58] that we preach that to those that are

[2:35:35] but yet I'm not what justify because I
[2:35:38] actually did what done it don't worry my
[2:35:40] friend he says but the word
[2:35:46] justify is as though you what never done
[2:35:50] it amen it's never even what regarded at
[2:35:54] all how is it done in God's book of what
[2:35:58] see your forgetfulness your old book and
[2:36:02] marriage is divorce and it is not even
[2:36:08] in the
[2:36:10] memories of

[2:36:19] what Justified he was how you was what
[2:36:23] accused you never done it what in the
[2:36:26] first place the old Union is in the
[2:36:29] water you was not married to it to begin
[2:36:33] with he the bridegroom B what shame
[2:36:36] himself for you in your place he took
[2:36:39] your place for you were predestinated
[2:36:42] for him to be his bride before the
[2:36:45] foundation of what the world the Bible
[2:36:48] said what you are the predestinated was
[2:36:51] let me finish with this my friend let me
[2:36:55] say this to you my Christian friend our
[2:36:58] attorney is also our judge our judge
[2:37:02] became our attorney the case is what
[2:37:06] settled when we receive his what pardon
[2:37:09] the judge himself came down and became
[2:37:12] what the attorney and the attorney and
[2:37:14] the judge is what the same person God
[2:37:17] became that we must judge justify Man by
[2:37:20] his own what that he Place upon what
[2:37:24] Hallelujah that means what he deserve
[2:37:28] all Praises our judge and attorney is
[2:37:33] what same
[2:37:37] person what is there to
[2:37:42] fear the Judgment that fall upon him at
[2:37:45] the cross at the grave and when he
[2:37:49] descended
[2:37:50] was for us he absorbed the full breath
[2:37:54] of the wound of sin and there is
[2:37:56] therefore now what no condemnation to
[2:37:59] them which are in Christ Jesus see
[2:38:03] forur our is what our judge he's both
[2:38:08] attorney and judge and the judge and as
[2:38:11] judge the case is what settled it is how
[2:38:15] finished there is now what no
[2:38:17] condemnation why should the church Fe
[2:38:20] what promise has he ever failed to
[2:38:22] manifest before us why should should he
[2:38:25] feel punishment or death he has all been
[2:38:28] what overcome he is what the mighty
[2:38:31] conqueror he's the one who conquered
[2:38:34] both the world of the seen and what the
[2:38:43] Unseen why is the Brad in judgment and
[2:38:47] there is no book against the Brad
[2:38:50] because the book of the Bride your
[2:38:53] personal record God took
[2:38:56] it and God pardoned
[2:38:59] it do you follow me and God took that
[2:39:02] and put it in God's feet of
[2:39:06] forgetfulness where the devil cannot
[2:39:08] even fish now the father who was your
[2:39:12] judge is the one who defend
[2:39:16] you he is now your attorney
[2:39:21] do you follow me do you follow me but
[2:39:24] brother Bram say when he take this book
[2:39:27] right here and he throw that in the in
[2:39:30] the in the sea of God forgetfulness
[2:39:32] behind him he open up a new book what is
[2:39:36] in this new
[2:39:39] book amen what is in this new book
[2:39:43] because remember remember the old book
[2:39:47] contains sins
[2:39:49] if God ever remember that he punishes
[2:39:52] you that's right but in the in Malachi 3
[2:39:55] there was another book of remembrance
[2:39:58] when God open
[2:40:01] it huh when you going through headache
[2:40:05] God open that
[2:40:10] one follow me again how many record do
[2:40:13] we have two this one if God open it you
[2:40:17] do but when when you suffering because
[2:40:21] you serve God because you stood for God
[2:40:24] there is another book both of this book
[2:40:28] are in the memory of
[2:40:33] God so the memory of God contain
[2:40:41] sections there are section that could be
[2:40:47] erased and there is a section that
[2:40:49] cannot be
[2:40:55] raised are we together are we together
[2:40:58] are we together there are things about
[2:41:01] you that God don't want to
[2:41:04] remember he cleaned that up but there
[2:41:07] are something about you that God need to
[2:41:12] remember sir and when God remember
[2:41:16] that something must happen to you
[2:41:23] Amen Let Me Close by this my
[2:41:27] friend I I'm P 6
[2:41:30] minutes if God according to brother Bram
[2:41:34] ever open the book your old book God
[2:41:37] will kill
[2:41:39] you do you follow me God took that
[2:41:43] negative
[2:41:44] record
[2:41:46] amen and destroy it and brother brandham
[2:41:49] say he open up a new record amen amen in
[2:41:55] that new record if they old record when
[2:41:59] they open it God is about to kill you
[2:42:03] what about they had a record when he
[2:42:06] open it what will he do to God toward
[2:42:11] you two record my friend you go meditate
[2:42:14] on this the first record if they open it
[2:42:18] if God look at that he sent judgment God
[2:42:22] remove it there is another record of you
[2:42:26] follow me carefully we will get to that
[2:42:27] in the Bible when God open the record if
[2:42:31] the first record send judgment what
[2:42:35] would the second record
[2:42:38] said because there those that feel God
[2:42:42] begin to
[2:42:43] Mur that we serve God and we are still
[2:42:46] suffering we go to church we are
[2:42:48] suffering been praying we are suffering
[2:42:50] then God say let me get the record but
[2:42:53] remember your old record is already
[2:42:55] destroyed so there Reon another a record
[2:42:58] of you that God has to pull because of
[2:43:01] your
[2:43:03] [Music]
[2:43:06] condition I don't know if you getting
[2:43:11] me I don't know if you getting
[2:43:14] me if you sick in the hospital and God
[2:43:17] pull your first record and he look he
[2:43:20] said this is a sinner like this he said
[2:43:22] this is Ahab kill
[2:43:25] him take him this time and move on with
[2:43:28] him kill
[2:43:30] him amen amen amen amen but for you amen
[2:43:37] when God put his hand on his pocket
[2:43:41] there is not two
[2:43:43] record it's only
[2:43:46] one it used to be two when God pull he
[2:43:50] will say which one is the bad this is
[2:43:51] the bad one now God has only one
[2:43:55] way not a two way only one way when he
[2:43:59] put his hand like this and he pull it
[2:44:02] there is only one record but he opened
[2:44:04] that record when you begin to complain
[2:44:07] and going through
[2:44:12] heartache I'm going to close by this the
[2:44:14] record is open when the devil pressurize
[2:44:18] you then God pulled that
[2:44:22] record and you're going to see what that
[2:44:24] record will do because they just were
[2:44:27] already murmuring they say look at the
[2:44:30] the wicked is Happy look at this and the
[2:44:32] Bible say when they change their
[2:44:33] conversation God say bring me those
[2:44:36] books a little
[2:44:38] bit let me read a little bit
[2:44:43] about when God begin to read about it
[2:44:46] Hallelujah you will see what is in that
[2:44:48] book
[2:44:49] and what we God will do amen amen amen
[2:44:54] that's the reason why on the Judgment
[2:44:56] Day you are not one to be judged you are
[2:45:00] entering with
[2:45:03] him and you are sitting with the judge
[2:45:06] judging the world because there is no
[2:45:08] record of you but there are record of
[2:45:11] you that are kept what is God keeping in
[2:45:14] you that's why brother brandham say when
[2:45:16] you sin God eras it from hisou
[2:45:19] memories but God does and eras
[2:45:23] everything because he need to remember
[2:45:28] you amen amen amen amen have I left you

[2:49:34] forgetfulness no one can go there and
[2:49:37] pull it even God
[2:49:41] himself let's stand my friend
[2:49:49] these things are hard for human
[2:49:53] being
[2:49:54] amen amen when you approaching God In
[2:50:00] Prayer when you approaching God In
[2:50:04] Prayer never mention what you did in
[2:50:08] 1947 because you're wasting even his
[2:50:15] time I don't know if you get what I'm
[2:50:18] saying
[2:50:21] amen because if you coming before him
[2:50:24] with 1947 in your mind you're not going
[2:50:27] to be able to pray right because you
[2:50:29] appearing like that bad man that was
[2:50:32] doing bad stuff is again approaching you
[2:50:36] that's not the case my friend that
[2:50:38] record is
[2:50:39] gone he doesn't remember that
[2:50:44] record as much as you remember it as
[2:50:47] much as they Court heaven
[2:50:49] he does him and no one judges the God
[2:50:54] Only
[2:50:57] God and that judge is your attorney and
[2:51:01] his judgment is final so you have to
[2:51:04] choose who you going to listen either
[2:51:06] you going to listen to people either you
[2:51:09] going to listen to yourself or you going
[2:51:11] to listen to
[2:51:14] God his word is true
[2:51:19] amen amen stop visiting that old
[2:51:26] house sometime take those old
[2:51:30] pictures you know the picture that you
[2:51:32] were wearing pant in the whole word burn
[2:51:40] them because they are they are remanding
[2:51:43] you what you are doing
[2:51:49] because the judge won't reminded if he
[2:51:52] remind you you're not going to stand in
[2:51:54] his presence but if you remember it you
[2:51:57] you're going to be complex but when we
[2:51:59] are we approach the throne of grace we
[2:52:02] must approach it with boldness am chew
[2:52:05] on what we went through then we're going
[2:52:07] to take the second part of these books
[2:52:10] and see what are in these
[2:52:13] books if our books of Sinners are
[2:52:17] destroyed do we have have another record
[2:52:20] what is that record for what is God
[2:52:22] doing with that
[2:52:24] record we have separate the record of
[2:52:27] sin to another
[2:52:30] record let's pray Heavenly
[2:52:33] Father Lord we approaching you humbly
[2:52:36] again this
[2:52:37] afternoon father thanking you for your
[2:52:40] grace for your love for your mercy and
[2:52:44] for destroying our old book
[2:52:49] written with our names with everything
[2:52:52] that we have done that was bad that the
[2:52:55] devil keep tormenting our heart our mind
[2:52:59] constantly reminding us of the past
[2:53:03] failure of the past
[2:53:07] mistake
[2:53:09] father we just establish what this book
[2:53:12] is but I pray that the Holy Spirit can
[2:53:16] take
[2:53:17] this and and drive this down into
[2:53:20] marriage
[2:53:23] life because there is a portion of
[2:53:26] marriage a record of
[2:53:28] marriage that was
[2:53:31] filled with
[2:53:33] fighting with
[2:53:35] argument with
[2:53:38] backbiting with
[2:53:41] trouble until if it was not for your
[2:53:45] grace one would have walked out of the
[2:53:48] marriage
[2:53:50] but
[2:53:51] father you kept your children TI
[2:53:55] together and despite the fact that they
[2:53:58] stayed
[2:53:59] together those record have created
[2:54:04] scars and the memories has been filled
[2:54:07] with
[2:54:08] them that every time a decision need to
[2:54:11] be taken we go back to those
[2:54:15] record and we fish in those record
[2:54:19] and we filter things through those
[2:54:21] record before we can make a
[2:54:24] decision and because of
[2:54:27] that we still constantly in fight in
[2:54:31] trouble in marriages because we never
[2:54:34] let those record
[2:54:36] go but father may you help each one of
[2:54:39] us each family Lord that Lord father you
[2:54:43] can give us Grace that which CH a record
[2:54:46] we have for one another
[2:54:49] that we messed up in the past that we
[2:54:52] made a bad
[2:54:54] decision a bad family decision a bad
[2:54:58] financial decision a bad move in buying
[2:55:01] this and that and because of that he has
[2:55:04] been remanded over and over and it caus
[2:55:08] a complex it caus a lack of trust it
[2:55:12] causes difficult beares and we cannot
[2:55:16] progress the right way because of these
[2:55:19] memories father May the blood of Calvary
[2:55:23] drop down in our life may they drop down
[2:55:26] in our marriages may they drop down in
[2:55:29] our relationship Lord so that that blood
[2:55:32] can wipe away those record and may
[2:55:35] father you put a block between us and
[2:55:39] those bad memories so that every time we
[2:55:43] want to think over it may Calvary Step
[2:55:47] Up
[2:55:48] May Lord father you remind us back again
[2:55:52] that remember what I did for you why do
