pray I wanted to praise the Lord but the devil was trying to really trouble me so something spoke to me like don't worry so I worshiped the Lord L everything was fine after church I spoke to some of the sister I said pray for my ring I cannot find it so I went to Sister Pam sister lurel I said pray for my ring I lost one of them it's it's a set of three so I was feeling bad to wear the two of them to stay with one so sister Pam told me do not worry and sister lorel told me it means something good is coming so I want to tell sister pimp don't worry something good is coming because I found my ring I thank God for that I praise God thank you I won't take long like the sister the sister say I cannot hold it either here I am in wor show South Carolina serviced one of my accounts a Family Dollar and I put my hand truck in my truck think that I had shut the door and I had to leave there to go to Greenwood which is about a 20 minute maybe 25 minute drive I'm driving the door wide open in the back the hand truck the Angels kept it there it could have been real real bad very bad accident so I just want to thank God for that looks like you on theob amen okay one more one more okay am I'm like our brother and sister I I just can't contain it and it's not really a testimony of mine to give but I've been holding it for two weeks I know you have heard me give the the the prayer request for Elijah in school but the devil's really been attacking him yet for him to be 12 and I'm sorry I don't mean to get emotional but he has pushed through at his age of 12 when the devil has beat him in his mind told him he couldn't do it beat him down by teachers staff at school that's hard to fight through for a 12 year old and his parents and his siblings tell him you can do it the ministry he is standing on and I've seen our son pray for hours for a breakthrough for himself so God could make himself real unto him he took him at his word and the Lord answered him he studied a week and a half I mean coming in late from school staying up for two hours doing his chores still prayed about it and Elijah made a be on his math test that's his testimony so it's a prayer request and it's a praise report because I give the Lord all glory and honor for that as a parent but keep him in prayer because he stands on this word at school kids at school have issues at home they have ailments they have sicknesses they find Elijah and the devil doesn't like it so y'all keep him in prayer please okay y'all need to write these things down so I can read them it's taking a while I'm sorry I'm

brother Michael God richly bless you and brother Gill good to see you again welcome to the house of the Lord amen glory to God praise God Amen I have a key that I wanted to share with you it's a very simple key but I believe it's the time for you to have it sometime you might not understand why I'm going to give you this but this will help you the rest of your life here on Earth until you meet the Lord in the air amen and if you use this wisely you will see every scripture every scripture will be unlock look in a way that you never even thought before amen am very simple key I just want to share with it amen so please give me some time I told brother Robert this morning I say the sermon I was supposed to preach last Sunday it's push for next Sunday because there is something else that came in the middle that open up I can't jump into it without going through this amen so you pray for me we need some time but let me share with you this key very simple but powerful if you know how to use it brother Bram says this I have this for a while but I felt like it's the time to go ahead and deliver this brother Bram say that therefore if there is any contradiction that anyone will think that the scriptures contradict each other that's an error amen amen amen amen why is this because when you read the Bible you will see something in one spot that will look like it's contradicting something else amen before you begin to think before you even ask a question just remember one thing there is no contradiction I know what I'm saying are we together are we together like I said God was the one creating when he create he say it is good when he create he say it is good when he create he say it is good then God turn around and say it is not good for men to be alone who created men alone God how did he create something that was not good [Music] amen amen I heard you here under the anointing so let's move on my friend I already heard you here so you can't go left and right I already heard you amen I saw you everybody enjoying and everything so I know you are anointed now how can God create something that he himself say it is not good you see now you see now so where you see contradiction in the Bible it is usually where a strong Revelation is hidden amen let me repeat it again I'm I'm I'm I'm helping you the rest of your life if you reading the Bible and you see something contradicting somewhere just know there is a big diamond that is laying right there and God doesn't want anybody to get access to it only the we destinated let's go back again praise the Lord Brother Bram say there is no scripture contradict a scripture and I'm going to drive this home this principle applies to the message of brother BR amen if you see one coat contr and there is no [Applause] contradiction it tells you there is something you need to study more you just about to miss something very big you say brother stepen this is the Bible this is the message in this church the message and the Bible are one why one why when they challenge brother Bram on brother about his message brother Bram pick up the Bible and put it on a puit and call preachers and say take the Bible and disprove my message in other word the Bible will never contradict the message [Applause] the Bible is the foundation of the message the message and the Bible are one and the message explain the Bible better than your eyes and your [Applause] brain so never be ashamed sir to talk about the message because the message came from the Bible the problem is preacher did not know this and because they don't have the answer now they begin to remove the message to try to hold on the church in the Bible when the message came from the Bible and when you remove the message you remove the [Applause] blood are we together amen are we together I'm moving the airplane my friend I'm online soon going to take off we together amen praise God brother brandham say the contradiction is where that maybe it contradict our way of looking at but it doesn't contradict what itself so if you find a contradiction just know it's your brain If you say wait a minute this one looks like it's contradict just know that it's your way you missing some glass [Applause] what an anointing in this place he say I have been in the ministry going on what 26 years now now I have never one time found one thing in the Bible that contradict anything else was written where in the Bible just know it is not there [Applause] [Music] are we together the contradiction is in our brain not in God brother brandham says this glory to God he says there is your contradiction looks like it now if you are reading with a corner mind brother Tony and not an open heart it shall be a [Music] contradiction Corner mind in other word when you reading the Bible you looks like a contradiction just know your Coral mind is activated that's right turn the coral mind off amen and open the heart amen and say Lord I know your word doesn't contradict itself that's right when you begin to approach like that God say that's my son over there open up amen this is what was laying there that's right are we together amen brother Bram say but if you shall read it with what openminded the Holy Spirit has heed this has he this from the eyes of the wise and prudent Jesus say so and thank God for it amen for what for hiding it and has revealed it to who B such as will what learn if you got a mind and not a selfish man but a willing heart to do what learn the Holy Ghost will teach you these what things remember the rest of your life no contradiction in the Bible no contradiction in the message of the hour and when it seems like there is a contradiction usually there is a big Revelation that is laying right there and God does not want the seed of the devil to pick it up because if the seed of the devil pick it up they can do great damage only the predestinated seed can pick it up because it's for you are we together are we together so now let's stand for the reading of the word my sermon the title this morning is our life journey through Joseph's five garment part 52 I told brother Robert and say God has been so gracious to us that now everything that the devil has been bothering us God is unlocking all of them and if you stay in tune you will see where we going amen amen amen my friend this thing is loaded Hallelujah I told you 100 quot now it's 120 something Cod and last Sunday we read one quote and three scripture so before you leave this earth you're going to smell the message you will breathe the message you will talk the message you will be walk and the message is going around you because we have touched the unlimited are we together amen oh my my theme this morning if I will get to that it's prayer here thank you amen time yes sir you ready yes sir season amen you pray God if I can touch that and purpose without these things the devil will trouble you amen amen prayer which we know goes with answerer but the time [Music] element and the season element and the purpose element let's dig into this in the first level let's go to Luke 15 glory to God hallelujah flight attendant prepare for takeoff let's pray he father Lord we are approaching you humbly this morning Father we thank you for your presence for your anointing and for everything that you have been doing for us throughout Lord father the week Lord we are reporting in our place the place where we feel happy where we feel Lord father a home temporarily in this earth Lord where your presence is there and we can Fellowship together with Saints of light precious Faith Lord this is as far as I can go with the ability you have given me but when he come to speak to your children and to bless them and interpret the word you only take the supernatural action of the Holy Spirit father may you move me completely out of the way may you move the audience completely out of the way may you come down in the power of Resurrection may you speak to our soul and bless us both visible and invisible audience and future audience Lord we commit them unto the hand in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen Luke 15 ah amen amen verse 11 if you dare you can say amen amen the Bible says and he said this is Jesus a certain man has two sons and the younger one of them say to his father father give me the portion of goods that fall to me and he divided to them his living you might be seated we found out that this young son here have a faith yes yes amen all it takes is for him to know what belongs to him if he knows that this belong to me whether it's time or not he can approach the father amen based done his need that's right amen and he's approaching the father with faith that's right go straight and say hey divide unto me the portion of my good who told him he belongs to him so somehow he learned yes that whatever the father has belong to him amen are we together so if he belongs to him he has a portion amen he didn't go ask somebody El portion amen amen he asked his own portion amen and he told the father give me my portion amen he's not someone who knows something and sit down no sir he's somebody when he knows what belongs to him he will move on and act are we together are we together amen that's the difference between the younger and the older and the younger is the Gentile you already know that because the older usually wait don't worry my friend job to verse 17 ah glory to God job to verse 17 not even 17 let me skip quickly 17 job to 29 so we see what's going on amen amen you there amen the Bible say this is the father talking to the older son the Elder one amen and the Elder now is saying and he answering say to his father look these many years do I serve you we don't have any problem about it neither transgress I at any time your commandment very good boy and yet you have never G me a kid why didn't you [Applause] ask I'm asking my friend we just about to leave the airport why didn't you ask your brother asked and and he receive you are waiting for the father to give it to you are we together are we together all these years serving the father keeping his commandment but still waiting for the father to do in other word the father sees me he understand that I'm a good boy so I'm expecting one of this day he will say good boy I have been watching you for a while the father also is quiet don't worry my friend he says yet you never gave me a kid that I I make marry with my friends but as soon as this your son the Troublemaker yeah was come which has devoured your living with harot you have killed for him the FED Cal it's not fair amen and and he said to him this is the father son you are ever with me watch this and all are we reading the same Bible everything all that I have is what so everything that remain in that house was the inheritance of the Elder son but the Elder son never asked for it he was waiting for the father to give it to him and the father never gave it to him but the youngest son doesn't work like that the youngest son when he knows what belongs to him he move on to action so one have an active

may talk how too much you may walk out too much but you shall never pray what too [Applause] much prayer is 24 hours if you work third shift prayer is open if you work first shift prayer is open if

with him to do what talk with him this is God who wanted you must sing too mucho much or you might preach too much sometime I'm reading brother Brandon sometime but there is one thing you shall never be able to what overdo that is what pray I would that man pray where everywhere doing what lifting up holy hands you shall never be able to have too much fellowship with God so prayer is a fellowship and God's long for his creature uh-huh who he has created in His image to do what fellowship with him pray without what ceasing are we together then in verse 18 I'm almost going to be finished with the review the Bible says in something everything in what everything in other word in every circumstance Amen in every situation do what give thanks because for this is what the will of God so the will of God is for us to do what give thanks the will of God for your life the Bible say it is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning who you so your the will of God concerning you is to do what give thanks I heard you giving testimonies here popping up left and right and I say my God the Deacon are going to open the fire sooner because they're going from one person to another but but I got a news for you God say it is his will to give thanks give thanks for Elijah give thanks for the wind give thanks for the track give than for everything for the bir day give thanks give thanks and

are doing what [Music] [Applause] complaining ah glory to God because I think one of the horriblest things is to see a or a who woman that is constantly complaining amen because the scripture give you no room to complain no room to worry you got prayer you got supplication you got Thanksgiving no [Music] room brother I'm saying it is one of the horriblest things is to see a man or who a woman that is how constantly complain you know nowadays with the economy with what is going on they shutting down people they shutting our job you know what is going on ah ah you are running my battery [Applause] low I don't care who is in the power because there is somebody above that man put whoever you want to that's not the problem God control the heart of the [Applause] [Laughter] Kings brother BR I'm say I have always thought God keep me from it from complaining too much he say that does what we [Applause] fath just know from today every time you complain you are weakening your [Applause] faith you are weakening your strength and the Bible say do not complain take your complaint turn it into a request because God does not heal Sinners that one we know it but the Bible says in First Peter 3 that for the eyes of the Lord are over who the righteous and his what ears are what open unto their prayers the ears of the Lord are open unto who the righteous the prayer of who the righteous so instead of complaining instead of worry God is always 24 hours ready to up ready not one here both of them in other word your sh your receiving station is always open you can send as many requests as you want he will always receive them you can never feel your receiver Oh Glory to God but the face of the Lord is against them that do what evil do we do evil no so what's the problem glory to God the Bible says in second chronicles 7 verse4 If my people which are called by who my name which is the BR amen shall do what humble themselves and what and pray and do what seek my face and turn from the what Wicked way because sometime we don't want to let our Wicked [Applause] Ways God say if you turn from your wicked way then we do what hear from heaven and do what forgive their sin and we do what heal their land we want to hold on to certain things we don't want to let it go but we want an answer from God and God say Let It Go I'm going to give it to you brother Bram says this glory to God he says he know if God answer his prayer what was going to cost many people I have seen them right since I have been here come up to the Altar and the Holy Spirit Come to them and they don't want to die they want to stay alive in the world you can't serve two Gods at the same time are you ready to forsake everything and to serve god listen at him this is Samson Lord only what this once more Samson found out that what is causing me the trouble today I'm ready to die with it and God gave him the greatest victory Of Heaven Let It Go and God will give it to you where are you heading Pastor you're moving very good my friend Zechariah yet a good man a holy man righteous man that had prayed for these things notice it he did what he failed to believe what he has been praying [Applause] for when he prayer was what answered isn't that about like most of us today praying and if God answer your prayer you scare he scare you to death we getting somewhere my friend notice he had prayed all this time and God was answering his prayer and I say this here God will answer what every sincere prayer I believe it how in his own [Applause] way what you need is money period it can come in cash up in Zeal in money order in cash in wire transfer that is God privilege receive it and move on are we together are we together are we together he can even come as a check in his own way we clear my friend amen we clear my friend amen oh the Bible says in James five confess your fault one to another and pray one for another that he may be healed the [Applause] affection effectual what fervent prayer brother RAM used the word desperate fervent prayer of who a righteous man do what ath much Eliah was a man subject to like passion as what we are in other words Elijah was no different than you you think God answer Elijah because he was super super James is saying no he was just like you don't worry my friend I'm going to get amen he says he was a man just like you and he did what prayed earnestly that he might not what rain and he rain not on the earth one man controlling the [Applause] Earth under the blood of bulls and goat one man controlling the Earth amen and then by a space of what 3 years and 6 months and he pray again and the heaven did what gave rain and the Earth did what brought forth her fruit it looks like the the remote control of the Earth was in the hand of Elijah so if Elijah goes pin nor and then when it's time Elijah goes again and say in and reain that's why Jesus coming in the New Testament say whatever you bound I hope we together that was the Old Testament whatever you bind like Elijah I will bind it and whatever you lose I will also do what what are you trying to say Backle up my friend I'm getting there amen this is the beginning of the battle you fighting you until you get to the heat of it are we together amen are we together amen listen to this my friend brother Bram says this he says oh how thankful we are to know in this hour when darkness is settling over the Earth and how and gross Darkness over the people how that we thank thee that we have this great Rock of Salvation the sure anchor of what the soul that we know we don't have to do what guess at it our God leaves that may does what the promises and shows himself how alive Among Us ready to do what answer our prayers and do what whatever we would desire in our hearts if he be found where in his Divine will and what his [Applause] promises are we together so if whatever you looking for is in the promises of God or it is in the will of God and we already found out that the will of God is the word of God if what you're looking for is in the word of God brother Bram say God will give it to you are we together now I got a question what about if what I'm looking for it I don't see that in the Bible I told you everywhere the devil block you we are unlocking that's right Amen brother stepen if I have a child problem Elijah the widow woman everybody knows that if I need this I know this I need what about if my situation when I'm searching the scripture I canot find a scripture to match my problem because if I found a situation then my faith suck into [Applause] it and and my faith say you are the same yesterday today and forever you did it for so and so and if you did it for one person you were do you got to do it also for me now here is you did it for so and so I'm coming under the same thing you need to give it to me but pastor Pastor brother Steven you see things we go through nowadays some of them I cannot found pinpointed and find it in the Bible how would I pray if I don't find it because I need to have an anchor because the devil will fight you and say what is the promise you using it your pastor preached to you that you need a promise that you need a scripture you don't have a scripture how you standing on this what answer should I give the devil from the Bible let's go to John 21 [Applause] amen I'm giving you time my friend brother Steven I can't find my situation amen what answer should I give to the devil what scripture should I use for me to have a resting place that my prayer is going to be answered because I'm coming according to the will of God if you dare you can say Amen John 21 jum to verse 25 this is your rescue forever my friend are you there amen are you there amen are you there amen a few people are you there amen are you there if I don't find the scripture in the Bible that's going to match my problem which scripture should I use which story should I use in the Bible to match my problem and to bring it to God John 20 1 verse 25 what does he say my brother and there are also many other things which Jesus did the which the break my friend there are also how many things many other things which who did Jesus did the which if they should be what written everyone as suppose that even the world itself could not contain the books that should be what WR in other way Jesus did more than what is written in the [Applause] Bible I don't know if you getting me I don't know if you're getting me the Bible say if they were if if they take record of the things Jesus did they can use all the books they can use the entire cloudd and it will not contain the call Jesus did so Mr devil this is where my faith goes somehow among the miracle there is one that matches me I don't know if you're getting me I don't know if you're getting me I don't know if you're understanding when you pray you need a promise when you pray you need a scripture to bring it to God and say God this is what your word say and this is what I'm looking for if you don't have a scripture am are we together you go to John 21 you tell God you say father you did so many things that even the books of this world cannot contain it so now my faith is [Applause] [Music] [Applause] unlimited I know that you a beig you can do anything so I'm anchoring my faith here you I don't know if you're getting me you God find yourself the miracle that you know that matches my situation me I'm standing in John 25 I'm going to sleep in John 25 you find yourself and your and match my situation [Applause] let me start it again my friend let me start it again my friend question do you know how many case were there do you know how many case are loaded under John 25 do you know how big they are so how can you tell me my case is not there because me and you don't know but all we know is unlimited so don't come to prove me because you are not there none of you leave in the time of Jesus Christ so don't come and tell me my case is not there it is up to God to look and say your case is not there but if God have not [Applause] spoken I don't know if you get what I'm saying if God have not put a limit I cannot put myself a limit if you don't have a scripture run through John 2025 are we together are we together in other word from today you have one scripture that can match all your [Applause] [Music] trouble are we together the Bible say there were many Miracle so Jesus maybe met somebody and the person explained the problem and Jesus heal him it's not written whatever they were I'm in trouble or sickness it's not written Jesus meet another person maybe he was climbing on a tree it is not written maybe Jesus get in the water it's not written all of that it's not written so that's no longer my problem my problem is there are many things that you done that are not written I search man I don't see now I'm putting mine in the sea amen of Miracle ah you yourself find yourself a your problem that you did to somebody in Galilee and hook it I guarantee you when your when your fishing hook is going down and the John 21:25 it will go down and you going to hear it hook I don't know which promise but it's giving the signal is there move out are we together amen together amen if you going through God without a promise and the devil trouble you you say Hey you were there me I was in heaven you were there and you know what he did you know all the miracle that he did you know how he ho he whoop you so much until we don't have room for the testimonies so if you think my case is not in the Bible bring them record bring the record if you cannot produce the record that's your problem my faith is God did [Applause] unlimited are we together are we together do you have any case that doesn't have a promise in the Bible from today everything you have need of it's written there are we together are we together because if Jesus would have sit to right he healed this one he healed this one he even Ministry there are many healing that were not recorded but what we have in the Bible is sufficient to get you to the way you need to go but God knowing the devil say no no no no I know my children John before you close the book take this open this here so they can use this door if they enter this door everything is possible [Applause] [Music] are we together the only one who can say this miracle I Didn't Do It Is God but if God remain silence then you did it are we together are we together are we together you don't have a promise go to John you got a promise pick up the promise you don't have a promise back up to John you say father there are many things you did no record could even keep it so I don't know what you did but I know somehow Hallelujah because you know the end from the beginning so you already saw my problem so you already provided a case under your unlimited case that will match my problem because you're the god that knows everything upon that scripture I'm coming for this are we together are we together now let's get to the meat you ready now if somebody's full I have plenty of time my friend let's get to the meat you ready you ready brother Bram say I

denying Jesus no I don't know him I don't know him hey hey hey I thought Jesus pray for him there is no contradiction in the [Applause] Bible my friend I am going slowly to help you I am going slowly the way me and you thought if Jesus pray for him it means Peter will see a spear or a sword and go into a sword and the sword doesn't do nothing because Jesus prayed for him that's the way we thought but we found Jesus my friend if you don't swallow this what is coming up will shake you and I'm going to bring it from the Bible but we found Jesus pray for somebody and that person begin to struggle boom you know him no no no I don't know him no no no I don't know I don't know don't even talk to me about him I don't know him be there the disciple scratch head did the prayer of Jesus work or not

is the year and I'm going to show you guess what I'm going to testify and some of us get a little bit more zealous we begin to testify ahead because the Seed of Abraham must speak first Hallelujah it's for me hallelujah it's for me it is this year confessing can I continue my friend can I continue my friend fifth year it did it happen your faith ran out can I continue can I continue the vision is for an appointed time 10 are we are we now after 5 years you get in D [Applause] ter can I continue this is the hardest trial ever [Music] can I continue now don't now how are you doing good come on today we will preach about the seven seal the seven seal when he was ined and God came down today we will preach about faith don't give up your faith Hallelujah because you are looking for something to keep boosting you because you are in the lingering time all the teaching are not important you still holding to the faith your faith need a boost a jump boost so the preacher who's going to jump boost that's the one that will receive more amen [Applause] the pastor is preaching Jesus you begin to search for motivational [Music] speaking watch your WhatsApp you will see even message believer begin to put TD J they begin to put this one they begin to Jo Austin because they're saying something to pump they are in a lingering don't linger now every Avenue is important do he lingers we are here though he lingers and God say no he will not hry my I am is 10 you the one that put five when it's 10 years when day you [Applause] [Applause] pray I don't know if you understand even if you don't fast I have heard the Cry of my people I have come down on do you follow me do you follow me do you follow me because there was a there was a promise your people will sourn in a foreign land for and for 400 years they will be mistreated then I will come Israel was praying through slavery right the prayer God heard all of them all but he was not time yet but when the time came Moses I have come down yes sir in other words there is nothing Egypt will do they must come out because of the time element do you follow me Oh Glory it's only one minute left my friend let me try Jesus amen the Bible says for the vision is yet for what an appointed time but the at the end it what it shall speak it shall not what lie it will happen my friend though what even though in Your Vision according to your term it is taking too long don't worry there is an appointed time don't tell do what wait for don't tell do what wait for it if you don't wait you lose [Music] expectation yes sir do you follow me when you wait it means you are under expectation so when you go through your lingering period keep your expectation are we together don't do what wait for it because will what surely come he will not what ter he will not t according to God's faith and God's time it is tearing because of verse seven you shall die like human being that's the one that sees the ter are we together are we together why because the time of God is more important than our time amen amen because according to ecclesiast 3:1 he God has made what everything how beautiful when in his time [Music] [Applause] in you want your F to be beautiful do you want what you looking for to be beautiful wait for the time of God you want your marriage beautiful wait for the time of God you want your school beautiful because when the time of God come he will make everything out all things will work [Applause] [Music] together listen to me my friend listen to me my friend when it's not his time you will be working hard that's right that's right because you're the one pushing you pushing here you pushing here you pushing here you pushing here but when his time comes it look effortless you just stand there and he open you know how you get in warmart you just get to the door that is his time because when he his ways your way amen are pleasing to him he will make at peace your enemy God will begin to move everything because it's his time he must be [Applause] [Music] beautiful I don't know if you get it can I continue give me a few minutes my friend and I'm going to head to the airport I I I this is the beginning so next Sunday we need to push it to the Another Sunday the seron amen listen to brother Bram listen to this the Bible say in Jeremiah for I know Lord help me I know what the thoughts the thoughts I do what that I think toward you thought who say that sayith the Lord thought of how of peace and what not of evil and to give you what end an expected end so his project is already guaranteed his touch toward you is for a good end he said I know the thoughts I know you don't know you don't know I know you don't know what I'm thinking about you but me God I know and because I know I'm working things according to what I know amen by the end of what are not for you will be good amen amen GL GL Lord help us amen he says I know that thoughts not one that I think toward you say who the Lord thoughts of what peace his thought is for peace than amen and not for what of evil to give you what an expected end so at the final product you will be happy Isaiah 55: 8 he say for my thoughts are not what your thoughts neither are your ways what my ways let me read this again let's go read it again for my thoughts are not your thoughts my what ways are not your ways it depends on where we are his thoughts or your thoughts his thoughts are different than yours amen amen am your prayer he already heard it hearing your prayer is not a problem the problem that the devil attack is the answering the shipping is okay but God shipping back it's where the devil is there right that's right he says for my thoughts are what not your thoughts and what neither are your ways my ways says who the Lord for us the what Heavens are what higher than the earth so what my ways toward what higher than your ways and my thoughts what than your thoughts in other word me and you we are so far apart that until there is an explosion that when you will understand what I was thinking about you when I say no you didn't know what I saw I saw the [Applause] exposion but you saw the temporary juice thing you looking for amen that's it are we together listen to brother Bram I'm heading to the airport my friend brother Bram say now the reason that Moses had forgot about what Freedom God's promise that he would do what freedom but God had not forgot his promise Moses tried yes how in himself and did what and failed I tried I fail so God didn't answer me that's not it I triy and he did what failed that is what the church has done how many times many times that's right and we come with a conclusion that prayer don't work the prayer did not work because of your time your prayer was going to 5 years and you say God didn't answer my prayer your answer is here God already heard you from the beginning because Daniel was praying in Babylon but it took 21 days it's written in your Bible for the to come and when the angel came he said Daniel from the beginning when you just pray I already heard you but you got to go through 21 days before you get the answer your time versus God time my point is when you send prayer it is received the problem is time and when it's not according to your time you call that no but God didn't say no you one that says no it is not for you but the nose of God hallelujah are you together are better than his yeses the nose of God is 10 years your yes is five a five you going to go work here everything will work beautiful Lord help me he says but God had not forgotten his promis amen Moses tried in himself and did what and failed that is what the church has done what many times we try in ourself to do things when we fail after we fail we fa to find what God's element of time amen amen the timing was different do I get discouraged I can't even get to the Bible where I want it to get let me get this and hit this and we get there brother Bram say God's got a time for what all things we are still on time I have not touched season he said God got a time for what all things he's got a time we plant what corn we got a time that we PL what we plow corn and then what at the time we harvest corn uh-huh and then the spring rains come uh-huh the drought through the summer uhhuh the fall rains and then what the Snows you just can't say I plant my wheat today and tomorrow I go out and R that's right God has got what times for season amen he has what seasons for his word amen amen amen he has season for his word you can pray all you want look at the season am we will get to that my friend he has time when the scripture says where it says and the presence of the Lord was there to heal the sick amen that is when Jesus was ministering to and the presence of the Lord was there to heal them s maybe at other times the presence of the Lord was not there to heal they [Applause] sick these are hot potato my friend because it's not a time it is not the season he says maybe some other time the presence of the Lord was not there to heal what the sick and we found out that God Works water everything how seasonally amen and now when Moses what he failed to find was the time limit of God the time limit of God the time and the season back up we're going to drop this airplane my friend brother say so then when Moses found out now they will direct will of God and the time of God and the revelation of everything to do now try to keep him out to [Music] Egypt why is it that Moses the first time try kill one man and he run away but when the time came and the will came and the Revelation came it look like Moses is unbeatable Moses became a [Applause] god before time he was not a [Applause] God I'm heading toward the airport my friend I'm dropping my friend before time he was not a God he was a human being but when time come whatever comes out of the mouth of Moses listen to me let me let me stop here because you won't get it my you we will get it next year and I mean uh next time when it's 10 years when it's 10 years yes okay you see here here you say tomorrow is going to happen and you saying that by faith you don't mean wrong amen am we need to speak the word yes sir you spoke the word tomorrow it didn't happen Satan is coming dancing Satan is coming to you dancing you say Satan what is going on he said you remember what you say yesterday and then you are trouble is this true or not because they say the third pool will be speaking we'll be speaking we'll be speaking but when 10 years come even if you cough tomorrow it happen your coughing will happen spoken word do you get me and then Satan say hey hey and people say hey he spoke and he happened it is are we together before time Moses is Moses when times come when the promise come the timing come there is a special anointing that will come down from heaven to use you and to break every yoke Hallelujah at that time everything that you say will happen because the hour has come the time has come the element is correct you don't have to pray 20 minutes you can just give thanks and something happen [Applause] Church let's push the break here Church let's push the break here I went 16 minutes over let's push the break here my friend go chew on this okay okay this is this is the beginning of today's sermon this is what we got here okay stop right here my friend please go sit down and go soak this slowly before we coming amen amen and you will see how time amen and season and purpose work together amen and you will see that your prayer is always answered your prayer goes to God your prayer God heard you the problem is there are certain element that goes with the response from God that's right that's right am amen are we together God has his timing he has his purpose and he has his season are we together that's why we say sometime I pray for 2 years and then God answer me but there are some prayer in two days God is answering you then you come you say brother you don't know I have been on my knees for this boy for 7 years finally he came up mama the problem is not your prayer you keep pushing and and killing yourself no God already heard you live
