[0:00] because she was spiritual in seen
[0:01] visions. A few years afterwards they
[0:04] found out that that woman was a saint.
[0:07] So of course you done great penance. You
[0:09] dug up those priest's body that
[0:11] condemned her and burner and stole him
[0:13] into the river. Of course that you done
[0:15] great pentance for that for digging up
[0:17] this priest's body. Now in the days of
[0:21] the prophets what happened?
[0:24] They did the same thing. They didn't
[0:25] recognize them till they had done come
[0:28] ministry had finished took out of that
[0:30] the elected and then
[0:33] after they were gone they recognized
[0:36] that they had been a prophet among them.
[0:38] Jesus he came to the earth the endowed
[0:42] within him was the father God. I and my
[0:46] father are one. My father dwelleth in
[0:48] me. It's not me that doeth the works but
[0:50] my father. And if I do not the works of
[0:52] my father, believe me not. Now if you
[0:56] notice when he came about one one 90th
[1:02] of the world knew that he is even on
[1:05] earth at that time and yet the savior of
[1:07] the world.
[1:09] And then they never recognized who he
[1:11] was even the church or no one else until
[1:14] they crucified him, buried and rose on
[1:17] the third day before they ever know who
[1:20] he was. It comes in and goes out and
[1:23] people does not recognize it until it's
[1:26] passed
[1:28] and they because that it never fits
[1:31] their theology. It never fits the time
[1:33] of the day. You see what it is? They're
[1:36] always living in a glare of another age.
[1:40] Always.
[1:41] The reason they didn't accept Jesus
[1:43] because they were living in the glare of
[1:45] the law. And when Jesus came was not
[1:48] contrary to the law but come to fulfill
[1:51] the law well they couldn't accept him
[1:53] because his message wasn't exactly the
[1:55] way they had it all treated out and it
[1:57] was called then traditions and they he
[2:00] didn't come according to the traditions.
[2:02] He didn't keep their traditions and
[2:04] really he upset it and tore it up and
[2:06] and done things that was contrary to it
[2:09] in so much as they thought he's breaking
[2:10] up the churches and they couldn't
[2:12] receive him because of his message. And
[2:15] we all know today that he come exactly
[2:17] in the line of God's prophecy.
[2:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:20] &gt;&gt; But they didn't know it then and it
[2:22] could happen again and we wouldn't know
[2:24] it. I imagine if he had actually
[2:26] appeared tonight, it would be so
[2:28] contrary to what we've all got all
[2:30] figured up on our charts and in our
[2:32] schools and things that be very few
[2:34] would recognize what was going on.
[2:36] &gt;&gt; He said it would be how he come. Now, uh
[2:39] Jesus being there so scripturally
[2:42] identified by the scriptures and the
[2:44] scribes and Pharisees of that day could
[2:47] not recognize him. Why didn't they? Why
[2:50] didn't they do it? Because they had it
[2:53] figured out some other way. That's where
[2:56] Jesus told him, "Search the scriptures,
[2:58] for in them you think you have eternal
[3:00] life, and they are they that testify of
[3:03] me." Amen.
[3:04] &gt;&gt; See, now he come exactly with the
[3:06] scriptures, but they had it figured out
[3:08] maybe that if he would come uh uh the
[3:11] Messiah would probably do what Moses did
[3:13] or what Noah did, build him an arc or
[3:16] something else. But we reason he come
[3:18] the way he did, they hadn't figured out
[3:21] in the scriptures with their traditions
[3:23] did not teach them. So the people were
[3:25] so confused, they didn't know what was
[3:26] going on. Wonder if that could happen
[3:29] today. I wonder if it could be different
[3:31] than what our traditions has taught us.
[3:34] And it could come and something had
[3:36] passed through and we'd never even know
[3:37] until it's already passed and then it's
[3:39] over. That's just about the way it'll
[3:42] come. Do you know when John the Baptist
[3:44] came on the scene that had been
[3:45] predicted all the way from the book of
[3:47] Isaiah hundreds of years about 800 years
[3:50] Isaiah prophesied I think before the
[3:51] coming of Christ. Did you know John came
[3:55] exactly the way Isaiah said he would
[3:57] come? He come exactly the way Malachi
[3:59] said he would come and even the apostles
[4:02] didn't recognize it. One day in Matthew
[4:05] 11, John was in prison and the apostles
[4:09] uh some of his disciples went over to
[4:11] ask Jesus was he the one or or should
[4:13] they look for another? Now notice Jesus
[4:16] did not uh give him a book of how to
[4:19] behave themselves, how to behave himself
[4:21] in jail or how to conduct his character.
[4:23] He said, "Stay around and watch what
[4:25] happens and go show John the things that
[4:28] you seen happen." That was the evidence
[4:32] that the He was that work.

[11:50] I'm desperate for you
[11:59] and
[12:08] I'm lost without you.
[12:15] [Music]
[12:17] Lord Jesus,
[12:20] Lord, where can we go, Lord God?
[12:24] There's none other, Lord, worthy as you,
[12:26] Lord God.
[12:28] Lord, you've shown us the secrets of
[12:30] your heart, Lord God.
[12:32] You've revealed to us, Lord, that those
[12:34] very secrets are those who sit before me
[12:36] as I speak this morning, Lord God. your
[12:39] sons and daughters. Lord God, you've
[12:42] given us the power of the spoken word in
[12:44] the last days, Lord God, through the
[12:46] revelation of your word from a prophet,
[12:50] Lord God.
[12:52] How thankful we are, Lord God.
[12:55] The desperation lies in the thirst that
[12:57] we have, Lord God. We can't get enough,
[13:00] Lord God.
[13:02] And that's why we're here this morning,
[13:03] Lord God. To receive more from the
[13:05] throne, Lord, directly from the throne,
[13:09] Lord God.
[13:11] Come and speak your word to us once
[13:13] again this morning, Lord Jesus.
[13:16] Have mercy on us, Lord, and forgive us,
[13:18] Lord, where we fall short. Lord God,
[13:22] let us forsake the things of the world
[13:24] that's not part of you, Lord God.
[13:27] We're living in an evil time, Lord God.
[13:29] And we need you more and more and more
[13:31] every minute of every day, Lord God.
[13:35] But we have the reassurance, Lord God.
[13:37] We have the assurance of the word. We
[13:39] have the promise, Lord. All of them,
[13:42] Lord. We understand what you meant when
[13:45] you said, "It is finished when you were
[13:47] on the the cross, Lord God.
[13:51] And by resurrecting, Lord, you gave us
[13:53] that life, too, Lord, because you've
[13:55] defeated the grave and death and hell,
[13:59] Lord. And you've given us that ability
[14:01] as well,
[14:03] for we believe you, Lord God.
[14:06] Help us to live our lives for you more,
[14:09] Lord God.
[14:11] Let us use this time this morning as we
[14:13] hear your word, Lord, to just recommmit
[14:16] in our heart, Lord God.
[14:19] We thank you, Father.
[14:21] Bless our musicians this morning, Lord,
[14:23] our singers.
[14:26] Bless our technicians, Lord.
[14:29] Take away any tiredness, Lord God, or
[14:32] any distraction, Lord God, that may
[14:34] hinder us from just entering into
[14:36] worship,
[14:37] Lord, so that when that word comes out,
[14:39] Lord God, as our pastor, Lord, you have
[14:42] have spent some time together, Lord, for
[14:45] what you want us to hear this morning,
[14:47] Lord, just let it come freely, Lord,
[14:50] without hindrance, Lord,
[14:53] and let us also receive it freely, Lord.
[14:57] Take any thought contrary to thy word
[14:59] from our minds, Lord, while we sit here
[15:01] and listen,
[15:04] and let it sink deep into our soul, Lord
[15:06] God.
[15:09] We thank you, Father. Let us not be
[15:10] troubled, Lord.
[15:13] Strengthen our faith, Lord God.
[15:17] Endo us with your power from on high,
[15:19] Lord God,
[15:21] that when we speak, Lord, it's the same
[15:23] as you speak it, Lord God. for we have
[15:27] determined that we'll speak nothing
[15:29] other than your word, Lord God.
[15:32] We give it all back to you this morning,
[15:34] Lord Jesus.
[15:36] Heal anybody, Lord, here that's sick. I
[15:39] know it's not time for prayer, Lord, but
[15:41] as we sing, Lord, let the joy just
[15:44] override the pain, Lord God.
[15:47] Let it override the broken heart, Lord
[15:50] God,
[15:51] or the troubled soul, Lord.
[15:55] And let us just sing with our heart,
[15:57] Lord God, and back to you. May it be the
[16:00] spirit that you've placed in us wooing
[16:02] back to the spirit this morning, Lord
[16:04] God.
[16:06] We thank you, Father, and we give every
[16:08] bit of this service, every portion of
[16:10] it, every person, Lord, every soul in
[16:14] our precious congregation
[16:16] and the invisible audience as well,

[27:22] noticed, there's some cloud pins out
[27:25] here on the table in the foyer. You're
[27:27] welcome to grab one. Some of the

[29:02] That's the way we look at Jeffrey. like
[29:05] how did where did you come from?
[29:09] So, we have one prayer request here and
[29:11] I got a quick glimpse of it and uh
[29:14] and uh this might be a little tough to
[29:18] read. Um this is from brother Michael
[29:20] Omach.
[29:22] Uh he says, "God bless you church. We
[29:24] request your prayers. Um we received
[29:27] information this morning of the passing
[29:30] of one of our grandsons.
[29:32] Uh his name is God Can. Amen.
[29:36] He died while in a boarding school. Uh
[29:39] he was 15 years old in the 10th grade.
[29:43] Uh we don't have any information at the
[29:45] moment, but we thank you for your
[29:47] prayers and just ask that God bless you
[29:49] for that. So, um let's stand this
[29:53] morning.
[29:55] And um
[29:57] Brother Kimma, do you mind coming up and
[29:59] praying over this prayer request? I'm
[30:01] sure we all have unspoken as well. It's
[30:04] been kind of a tough week.
[30:10] Let's just bow our heads.
[30:12] Gracious heavenly father, we thank you
[30:15] once again, Lord Jesus, for bringing us
[30:17] back to the house of God. We have come,
[30:20] oh father God, to worship the King of
[30:22] Kings, the Lord of Lords. There's none
[30:25] like you, Lord,
[30:28] the redeemer of our souls.
[30:32] the one who died on the cross
[30:35] and who made a way, oh God, that we may
[30:38] be what we are today. You are the lamb
[30:41] of God who took away our sins,
[30:44] the mighty God unveiled. And you did not
[30:48] want to keep that for yourself, but you
[30:50] came and shared it with us, your people,
[30:52] your bride, Lord, that we may have the
[30:55] righteousness of God, us who were
[30:57] sinners one day. Thank you for doing all
[31:00] of this for us, Lord Jesus. What can we
[31:02] give back to you, but our hearts, Lord,
[31:06] and that is what we're giving back this
[31:08] morning, Father, is the deepest, Father
[31:12] God, thoughts that we have. All of that
[31:15] we give back to you as a wife or father
[31:18] who's kept herself for her husband
[31:22] unveils herself to him. You are our
[31:25] husband this morning. Father, come and
[31:28] take over the service. Lord Jesus, bring
[31:31] your presence. Oh God, may you come and
[31:33] heal the sick. Oh Father, may you come
[31:35] and free the bond. Oh Father, whatever
[31:38] need is in your people this morning,
[31:40] Father. We know that you're more than
[31:42] able. Come, Lord Jesus, come. We are
[31:45] inviting your presence. It would be in
[31:47] vain that we gather without you here,
[31:49] Lord. Oh dear Jesus. You're the mighty
[31:52] God once again unveiled before us. Thank
[31:55] you for this message that you have sent
[31:57] that oh father God has cleansed us Lord
[32:00] has made us pure as pure can be. We've
[32:03] been washed by the blood of the lamb.
[32:05] Dear God, you've heard the request that
[32:07] went before you. May you take brother
[32:09] Mike and sister Rosemary. Oh father God
[32:12] losing their grandson not even knowing
[32:15] why. Father
[32:17] the why would be answered one day. But
[32:19] now we just bow before your throne. God
[32:23] receiving. Oh, Father, accepting for you
[32:26] said in your word that all things work
[32:28] together for the good. Even in death,
[32:32] there's always a good, Father God.
[32:34] There's nothing negative, oh Father, and
[32:36] that we do not want to have in our
[32:38] hearts this morning, Lord. But may you
[32:41] take the family, Father. Comfort them,
[32:43] Lord. Losing a loved one is not easy,
[32:46] Lord Jesus. Especially when he's 15,
[32:48] full of life, oh God. May you take the
[32:51] family, God, and comfort them, Lord
[32:54] Jesus, as you only you can take now the
[32:58] offering, the tithe, Lord Jesus. May you
[33:00] bless the giver, for we love to give you
[33:03] cheerfully. Bless the building fund, oh
[33:06] God, the building that's being built by
[33:08] faith. May you continue to increase our
[33:11] faith, oh God. May we be standing behind
[33:14] our pastor in this endeavor, Father God.
[33:17] And once we see the building finished,
[33:19] oh God, how rejoicing we shall be, Lord,
[33:23] knowing that we build a church, oh God,
[33:26] without any fund, but everything came
[33:28] from thee, Lord. We thank you once
[33:30] again. Take the service, Father. We give
[33:33] it back to you. Bless brother Steven
[33:35] this morning as he ministers to our
[33:38] hearts. In Jesus Christ's name we pray.
[33:41] Amen.
[33:42] [Music]
[33:46] Amen. And y'all might be seated. We're
[33:47] going to um have Sister Charlene give
[33:49] her testimony.
[33:52] Amen.
[33:54] &gt;&gt; God bless you, saints. I just want to
[33:57] give a a little testimony about my
[33:58] school. Um so I took my classes in the
[34:01] spring and everything was fine. Um, I
[34:04] had registered for my fall classes and I
[34:06] thought I had my my FAFSA squared away
[34:09] so it would pay for my classes, but
[34:11] turns out I didn't and I got all my
[34:13] classes dropped for the fall semester.
[34:16] And it was a little late. So, there was
[34:18] no more seats for me to be able to uh
[34:21] reregister for my classes again. And so,
[34:24] I was like, uh, I got to wait another
[34:26] year to be able to take my classes and
[34:28] get in my program. But when all the
[34:30] testimonies were given out on Wednesday
[34:32] night, I was like, God will make a seat
[34:34] for me so I can register for my classes.
[34:38] And on Friday, I went and I checked my
[34:41] school's website and there was one seat
[34:43] left for me to take my classes. I just
[34:45] want to give glory to God. Amen.
[34:53] Amen.
[34:54] Brother Tmaine, you ready to sing a song

[35:14] gotten up here maybe a few months ago,
[35:16] maybe last year, and told you all to
[35:18] keep Elijah in prayer um with school,
[35:23] and the Lord allowed our pastor to
[35:24] preach about being diligent and being
[35:26] the ant. He has really done that over
[35:29] the summer, even up until the beginning
[35:32] of this year to report because like
[35:34] brother John said, we're close-knit
[35:36] family. He has A's and B's and that's
[35:39] God's grace. So, praise the Lord.

[35:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:51] &gt;&gt; Everybody all right?

[36:02] remember since I was a young boy. I'm
[36:04] going try to uh try to sing to the best
[36:06] of my ability. God bless you.
[36:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:11] [Music]
[36:21] We've turned a page for a new day has
[36:26] dawn. And we've rearranged
[36:30] what is right and what's wrong. And
[36:34] somehow we drifted so far from the truth
[36:39] and that we can't get back home.
[36:43] And where are the virtues that once gave
[36:47] us life? And where are the morals that
[36:53] governed our life? And one day we all
[36:58] will awake and look back just to find
[37:02] what we've lost.
[37:10] We need to get back to the basics of a
[37:14] life. A heart that is pure and a love
[37:20] that is mine. A faith that is verundy
[37:25] grounded in Christ.
[37:28] The hope that endures for all time.
[37:34] But these are the basics. We need to get
[37:37] back to the basics of life.
[37:42] [Music]
[37:45] And through the rage is the reason it
[37:49] out.
[37:51] Just meditating. You can overcome every
[37:55] doubt.
[37:57] After all, man is a God. They say God is
[38:02] no longer alive,
[38:05] but I still believe in the old rugged
[38:10] cross. Oh, I still believe there is hope
[38:15] for the lost.
[38:17] And I know the rock of all ages will
[38:22] stand through the changes of time.
[38:26] Through the changes of time,
[38:31] we need to get back to the basics of
[38:35] life. A word that is pure and love that
[38:40] is mine. A faith that is firly
[38:45] grounded in Christ. The hope that is for
[38:50] all time.
[38:53] [Music]
[38:54] These are the basics. We need to get
[38:57] back to the basics of life.
[39:01] [Music]
[39:05] We've let the darkness invade us too
[39:09] long. We got to turn the tide.
[39:16] Wo. When we need the passion that burn
[39:20] long ago to come and open our eyes,
[39:26] there's no room and no room for a
[39:29] compromise.
[39:31] We need
[39:34] we need to get back to the basics of
[39:38] life
[39:40] that is true and the love that is mine.
[39:47] [Music]
[39:51] A heart that is pure and a love that a
[39:55] love that is blind
[39:59] and verballently grounded in Christ of
[40:02] hope that is true for all time.
[40:08] And these are the basics we need to get
[40:11] back to the basics of life.
[40:16] God bless you.
[40:19] [Music]
[40:23] Amen.
[40:25] Amen.

[40:48] You know, we're just going to exalt the
[40:50] Lord this morning. That's the hardest
[40:52] thing to do when we come through those
[40:54] doors is to get our minds off of

[40:59] mind off of every condition this

[1:02:44] and then I got ministers some are
[1:02:47] sending me quote every almost every day.
[1:02:49] This one is sending this this one. So
[1:02:51] it's so much and I have to remain
[1:02:54] focused. Amen.
[1:02:56] &gt;&gt; So bear with me by God's grace. So if I
[1:02:58] answer your your your text after one
[1:03:01] week just understand what's going on. If
[1:03:04] it's an emergency, call 911. Call the
[1:03:07] deacon.
[1:03:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:10] &gt;&gt; Have you Have you called a doctor's
[1:03:12] office? The first thing they say, if
[1:03:14] it's a true emergency, do what?
[1:03:17] &gt;&gt; H. If it's a true emergency, call the
[1:03:19] deacon.
[1:03:21] &gt;&gt; The deacon knows where to get me.
[1:03:27] &gt;&gt; And if it's a prayer, the deacon will
[1:03:29] step on and pray for you.
[1:03:31] &gt;&gt; I was listening to brother Brandham
[1:03:32] yesterday and he was talking about
[1:03:34] Jetro. And brother Brandham was putting
[1:03:36] himself how all the big responsibility
[1:03:38] he have and brother Brandham said no you
[1:03:40] got brother Neville another the minister
[1:03:41] here you go ahead and deal with it.
[1:03:43] Amen.
[1:03:44] &gt;&gt; Because I got a lot of stuff and uh
[1:03:47] sometimes brother Brandham say he would
[1:03:49] die he would go to the grave with
[1:03:52] certain things in his heart.
[1:03:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:55] &gt;&gt; So there are certain things spiritually
[1:03:57] I cannot explain to anybody. Even my
[1:04:00] wife, you won't understand me.
[1:04:02] &gt;&gt; And I just follow that direction and
[1:04:04] keep myself focused because I know what
[1:04:06] I'm in the middle of it.
[1:04:07] &gt;&gt; And it's hard for me to explain to you.
[1:04:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's like Elisha telling Gazi
[1:04:13] there is more with us and you can look
[1:04:14] around you say where is more.
[1:04:18] [Applause]
[1:04:19] &gt;&gt; So there are things I don't know how to
[1:04:21] explain to you and sometime you see my
[1:04:23] behavior a certain way I'm behaving like
[1:04:26] that because of certain things. It takes
[1:04:28] a lot of spiritual maturity to
[1:04:31] understand what we're dealing with.
[1:04:34] &gt;&gt; So to avoid any headache, I just hush my
[1:04:36] mouth
[1:04:37] &gt;&gt; and just keeping my lane.
[1:04:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:40] &gt;&gt; On 85.
[1:04:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:44] &gt;&gt; So, Young Sisters meeting September the
[1:04:47] 27th, question and answer session. And
[1:04:49] then our question and answer for the
[1:04:51] church will be October the 11th which
[1:04:54] will uh be at the clubhouse. Everything
[1:04:58] is secured to the best of my knowledge.
[1:05:00] And then following that will be October
[1:05:02] the 25th with the patriarch. Then we go
[1:05:05] with part three on courtship. Their
[1:05:06] courtship is so deep for some reason the
[1:05:10] Holy Spirit deal with them differently
[1:05:12] the new young sisters. H but I
[1:05:14] understand because they're men.
[1:05:15] &gt;&gt; Yes sir. Amen.
[1:05:17] &gt;&gt; So, the Holy Spirit is dealing with them
[1:05:19] differently. Amen.

[1:05:22] courtship I didn't know.
[1:05:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:24] &gt;&gt; I wish I knew them. Amen.
[1:05:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:26] &gt;&gt; But thank God for Sister Cher.
[1:05:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:33] &gt;&gt; So, October the 25th
[1:05:37] in this church, if you don't talk about
[1:05:39] your wife, that's your problem.
[1:05:44] &gt;&gt; I'm giving you an example. The pastor
[1:05:47] talk about his wife so that the entire
[1:05:50] congregation may talk about the wife.
[1:05:56] &gt;&gt; You tell them how beautiful they are,
[1:05:58] how sweet they are and all the kind of
[1:06:00] stuff. Then our children will know how
[1:06:03] to talk to the wife.
[1:06:07] [Applause]
[1:06:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:14] &gt;&gt; Let me stay away. I got a meeting
[1:06:16] tomorrow. I got a meeting coming up next
[1:06:18] week. So, let's deal in the meeting
[1:06:20] before I get offline here of off my
[1:06:23] lane. Amen. The building, we're still
[1:06:26] working with it. God's willing, we
[1:06:28] already got the code finalized for the
[1:06:30] door of the connector up front there.
[1:06:33] And Lord's willing on Monday, Lord, uh,
[1:06:35] Brother Micah will go try to put the
[1:06:38] order for the material. Then we can go.
[1:06:40] It seems like the the Abraham Lincoln is
[1:06:42] moving toward the connection of the
[1:06:44] building over there. As far as what we
[1:06:47] raising for the
[1:06:49] uh the foundation, we at $20,000 now.
[1:06:52] 20,000 now from a 67. You keep looking
[1:06:55] at your 67. That's your problem. Me, I'm
[1:06:58] looking at the 20,000 because it's a
[1:07:01] deep.
[1:07:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:04] &gt;&gt; And the deep will be calling to the
[1:07:06] deep. Yes.
[1:07:08] &gt;&gt; You know that mystery of the deep,
[1:07:10] right?
[1:07:11] &gt;&gt; It's the void that is really pulling.
[1:07:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:14] &gt;&gt; So, we are on 25 20,000. I thank the
[1:07:17] Lord for 20,000. If he can get me to
[1:07:20] 20,000, he will get me to 67.
[1:07:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:07:27] So, pray God the final touchup are
[1:07:30] almost done and will call for the final
[1:07:32] inspection and that building will be
[1:07:34] completed over there. I will try the
[1:07:36] best of uh the best that I can because
[1:07:39] the building is completed but it's
[1:07:40] empty. You need furniture. So I will try
[1:07:43] to put some chair quickly for the song
[1:07:45] leader and all the musician so that
[1:07:47] because that bathroom is ready to be
[1:07:49] used so they can all turn and go to the
[1:07:52] other side and they can do everything
[1:07:54] over there. So we begin to decrease the
[1:07:56] traffic on the back over there. So the
[1:07:59] musician will be coming this way. But as
[1:08:02] as far as my office, I need to wait till
[1:08:04] we put a desk or something then we get
[1:08:06] there. Amen. So be patient with me. I
[1:08:08] know some are quick on the trigger. When
[1:08:10] when when we will get there. Amen.
[1:08:13] &gt;&gt; Praise God. The pins are there. We got
[1:08:15] so many of them. They were free with our
[1:08:18] price, without money. And pray for me
[1:08:20] because uh it's something that have been
[1:08:23] there lingering. But I will try my best.
[1:08:25] We are very loaded but we can't be too
[1:08:28] loaded for that one. But we will try to
[1:08:31] find out how we can work up to have an
[1:08:34] hour of prayer.
[1:08:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:36] &gt;&gt; Every week
[1:08:38] &gt;&gt; somehow
[1:08:39] &gt;&gt; one hour of prayer. I know if we put it
[1:08:42] for everybody to come here then it's
[1:08:44] going to be schedule and traveling. We
[1:08:46] will see I would talk with the
[1:08:47] technician and see if we can put a zoom
[1:08:50] where we can go one hour in prayer. You
[1:08:52] just get into the zoom
[1:08:53] &gt;&gt; and then we can pray wherever you are,
[1:08:55] wherever you stay. You just put request
[1:08:57] and everything and we pray one hour as a
[1:09:00] church. Whoever is available,
[1:09:02] &gt;&gt; you can just hop onto that line. We know
[1:09:04] that a certain day this time if you want
[1:09:07] to hop on a prayer line. Just hop there.
[1:09:09] We're praying. If I can't do it, I would
[1:09:11] direct it to brother Kitty, one of the
[1:09:13] deacon, and then they can take it so
[1:09:15] they can remove something off my plate.
[1:09:17] Because what I'm dealing with, it's more
[1:09:19] than just preaching here and the
[1:09:21] ministry. You're dealing with people
[1:09:23] separated left and right and and and at
[1:09:25] the same time you need to keep yourself
[1:09:28] studying and and and
[1:09:30] consecrated and move and all everything.
[1:09:32] So I got brother Kelly, I brought
[1:09:34] brother Robert and brother Tony all of
[1:09:38] them can hop in and they can direct you
[1:09:40] into prayer and everything. So by God's
[1:09:43] grace just keep just one day we just you
[1:09:46] know that one hour you just hop on there
[1:09:49] put your prayer request we pray and then
[1:09:50] when we come in church it's going to be
[1:09:52] like additional prayer is everything
[1:09:55] okay?
[1:09:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:56] &gt;&gt; Are we okay with that?
[1:09:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:00] [Applause]
[1:10:02] &gt;&gt; Brother Glenn
[1:10:04] Brother Glenn they like it. So by God's
[1:10:07] grace it's going to happen sooner. So
[1:10:09] just hope just give me some time to work
[1:10:11] with the technician sister Adasa will
[1:10:13] see how they can put everything together
[1:10:15] into a zoom. So it will go on the church
[1:10:17] group chat and then once you see the
[1:10:19] zoom you can just hop into the zoom and
[1:10:22] wherever you are just come in and we
[1:10:25] give the request and we all pray because
[1:10:27] Jesus spoke about one hour
[1:10:32] &gt;&gt; and if you get more anointing you can
[1:10:34] continue no problem.
[1:10:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. I believe I got everything clear
[1:10:39] by God's grace. So, flight attendant,
[1:10:41] prepare for takeoff. So, let's go to the
[1:10:44] reading of our Bible.
[1:10:47] &gt;&gt; All of this, my timer is off.
[1:10:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:51] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:10:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:58] &gt;&gt; Spoken word tabernacle.
[1:11:02] Let's pray. Heavenly Father, Lord, we
[1:11:05] approaching you. humbly this morning.
[1:11:08] Father, thanking you for your grace,
[1:11:10] your love, your mercy, and for
[1:11:12] everything you have been doing for us.
[1:11:14] Father, this is as far as I can go with
[1:11:16] the ability you have given me. When it
[1:11:19] come to speaking to the bride, the wash,
[1:11:22] the purchase of the blood of Jesus
[1:11:24] Christ, washed by his blood. Father, he
[1:11:27] only take the supernatural action of the
[1:11:29] Holy Spirit. Father, move me completely
[1:11:31] out of the way. May you come and move
[1:11:33] the audience also out of the way. May
[1:11:36] you speak to our soul and bless us Lord
[1:11:38] Father. May we live from this place
[1:11:41] differently than the way we came in. We
[1:11:43] thank you and commit everything unto the
[1:11:46] hand in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.
[1:11:50] &gt;&gt; Sister Adas everything okay on the back.
[1:11:52] Praise God. My subject this morning,
[1:11:56] let's go to the book of Judges, chapter
[1:11:59] 16. The title this morning is our life
[1:12:04] journey through Joseph's five garment
[1:12:06] part 78
[1:12:10] 7 and 8 and as a team
[1:12:14] by God's grace it's perception
[1:12:19] when I mean perception this is a human
[1:12:22] perception
[1:12:24] &gt;&gt; or our perception
[1:12:26] perception
[1:12:29] versus
[1:12:31] discernment.
[1:12:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:37] &gt;&gt; In seasons,
[1:12:40] &gt;&gt; this discernment is a divine one.
[1:12:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:46] &gt;&gt; Again, perception
[1:12:49] versus discernment in seasons. Amen.
[1:12:54] &gt;&gt; Plural. This is what we're dealing with.
[1:12:57] Sorry, brother. Tony, can you see it
[1:12:59] better?
[1:13:00] &gt;&gt; Okay. Praise God.
[1:13:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:07] &gt;&gt; Yeah. I was trying to read one
[1:13:09] scripture, one verse, and the Holy
[1:13:11] Spirit opened something different.
[1:13:14] &gt;&gt; So, buckle up and we take off. I was the
[1:13:18] main thing is season happened and we
[1:13:21] miss it.
[1:13:24] &gt;&gt; That's true. I was trying to call this
[1:13:27] team
[1:13:29] why do we miss season? What cause to
[1:13:32] miss season
[1:13:34] before we continue with what are the
[1:13:36] further instruction of what to do in
[1:13:39] season? That was what was planned by the
[1:13:41] Holy Spirit. Slide that down the road.
[1:13:44] So what causes that we miss season?
[1:13:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:49] &gt;&gt; Human perception versus discernment in
[1:13:53] season. Let's go to the book of Judges,
[1:13:56] chapter 16, verse 17. Sister Rof, there
[1:13:59] is still a tiny noise in my monitor.
[1:14:03] Lord, a tiny one. Yes.
[1:14:06] Praise God. Yeah, it's getting better
[1:14:09] now at God's grace. Thank you.
[1:14:13] I'm going to stay on the surface because
[1:14:15] if I touch this a different way, we
[1:14:19] lost.
[1:14:20] He's going to preach a different
[1:14:21] message. Amen.
[1:14:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. So let's focus where we are.
[1:14:25] &gt;&gt; Uh
[1:14:27] Judges chapter 16 verse 17. If you there
[1:14:31] you can say amen.
[1:14:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:32] &gt;&gt; You know this story very well.
[1:14:35] &gt;&gt; Stay alert. You see somebody's
[1:14:38] slumbering. Shake. Shake.
[1:14:42] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:14:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:44] &gt;&gt; Ah. Amen.
[1:14:46] The Bible says in verse 17 that he told
[1:14:49] her,
[1:14:51] &gt;&gt; this is Samson,
[1:14:53] &gt;&gt; Samson, he told her all his heart.
[1:14:56] &gt;&gt; Mhm.
[1:14:57] &gt;&gt; And say to her, there has not come a
[1:15:00] razor upon my head. You may be seated.
[1:15:06] We clear.
[1:15:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:08] &gt;&gt; For I have been a Nazerat
[1:15:11] to God from my mother's womb. So he knew
[1:15:14] the secret.
[1:15:16] of his power.
[1:15:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:19] &gt;&gt; He just opened his mouth and unfolded
[1:15:21] and and disclosed the secret. Amen.
[1:15:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:25] &gt;&gt; To dilah.
[1:15:26] &gt;&gt; The Bible say, "For I have been a
[1:15:28] Nazerite to God from my mother's womb.
[1:15:33] If I shave,
[1:15:35] Amen.
[1:15:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:37] &gt;&gt; Then my strength will go from me."
[1:15:40] So the strength of Samson
[1:15:44] or the divine because brother Brandham
[1:15:46] say he look like a Cece.
[1:15:52] &gt;&gt; You need the quote you see me after
[1:15:53] church.
[1:15:54] &gt;&gt; And brother Bradam say he didn't have
[1:15:56] big muscles.
[1:15:57] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:15:58] &gt;&gt; Like the movie you watch.
[1:16:00] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.
[1:16:01] &gt;&gt; All you have watched.
[1:16:02] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.
[1:16:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:16:04] &gt;&gt; He was not a big man.
[1:16:06] &gt;&gt; No sir.
[1:16:06] &gt;&gt; So he was brother Brham explained that
[1:16:08] it was a mystery. Yes, I am.
[1:16:10] &gt;&gt; His strength was completely a mystery
[1:16:15] &gt;&gt; preach.
[1:16:16] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:16:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:17] &gt;&gt; So, his strength was connected to
[1:16:19] something
[1:16:22] &gt;&gt; in his body.
[1:16:24] &gt;&gt; And his strength was connected to the
[1:16:27] hair.
[1:16:29] &gt;&gt; I'm reading my Bible, my friend.
[1:16:33] &gt;&gt; Samson say if they cut what?
[1:16:36] &gt;&gt; His hair.
[1:16:37] &gt;&gt; What will happen to him? lose
[1:16:38] &gt;&gt; lose his strength.
[1:16:39] &gt;&gt; So the strength of Samson was connected
[1:16:41] to what?
[1:16:42] &gt;&gt; His hair.
[1:16:44] &gt;&gt; Good.
[1:16:45] [Applause]
[1:16:46] &gt;&gt; That's the way I like it.
[1:16:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:48] &gt;&gt; The hair of Samson
[1:16:53] &gt;&gt; was connected to his strength.
[1:16:57] &gt;&gt; And this strength is not a natural
[1:16:59] strength.
[1:17:00] &gt;&gt; No sir.
[1:17:00] &gt;&gt; It was a divine strength
[1:17:04] &gt;&gt; but connected to his head.
[1:17:07] How can hair
[1:17:09] &gt;&gt; carry strength, sisters?
[1:17:12] &gt;&gt; Uh-huh.
[1:17:13] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah.
[1:17:14] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[1:17:17] &gt;&gt; be careful with your head.
[1:17:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:21] &gt;&gt; Be careful with your hand.
[1:17:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:23] &gt;&gt; There is a power in the hand.
[1:17:27] [Applause]
[1:17:29] &gt;&gt; There is power in hand. That's right.
[1:17:32] Amen.
[1:17:33] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together now.
[1:17:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:38] We are together now.
[1:17:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:40] &gt;&gt; That's a wig right there.
[1:17:41] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:17:51] &gt;&gt; I'm warming the engine. You know, when
[1:17:53] you get into the airplane, the airplane
[1:17:55] begin to move and go back and go to the
[1:17:57] left and go back until we get to the
[1:17:59] place where we need. So, I'm I'm I'm
[1:18:01] just moving slowly. Amen.
[1:18:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:03] &gt;&gt; I hope you slept well. Amen.
[1:18:05] &gt;&gt; Ah, glory to God. Sister Sherro, say
[1:18:08] amen. So everything is good.
[1:18:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. And the Bible says, "From my
[1:18:12] mother's womb," God bless you. Welcome,
[1:18:15] my friend. He said, "From my mother's
[1:18:18] womb." Amen. From my mother's womb, if I
[1:18:21] be shaved, then my strength will go from
[1:18:25] me
[1:18:26] &gt;&gt; and I shall become how?
[1:18:28] &gt;&gt; Weak.
[1:18:28] &gt;&gt; And be like what?
[1:18:30] &gt;&gt; Any other man.
[1:18:31] &gt;&gt; So he was not he was not like any other
[1:18:33] man.
[1:18:35] No.
[1:18:38] &gt;&gt; He was not like any other man.
[1:18:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:41] &gt;&gt; Because of the Nazareth vow.
[1:18:43] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.
[1:18:46] &gt;&gt; And the strength that he had.
[1:18:48] &gt;&gt; In other words, there was something
[1:18:50] supernatural
[1:18:51] [Music]
[1:18:52] &gt;&gt; in Samson that was more than what is
[1:18:55] natural.
[1:18:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:58] &gt;&gt; He was a natural being with something
[1:19:00] supernatural
[1:19:02] connected to him.
[1:19:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. And that supernatural thing was
[1:19:06] connected to his hair.
[1:19:14] &gt;&gt; How did we end up in Samson talking
[1:19:16] about season?
[1:19:19] &gt;&gt; Job to verse 18. And when Dilala saw
[1:19:24] that he had told her all his heart, he
[1:19:28] sent and called for the Lord of the
[1:19:31] Philistine. We clear now? Amen.
[1:19:33] &gt;&gt; So she can discern that this time is not
[1:19:36] fake.
[1:19:38] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:19:38] &gt;&gt; This time is the truth. Amen.
[1:19:41] &gt;&gt; That he told her all his heart. She sent
[1:19:44] for and called for the lords of the
[1:19:46] Philistines saying, "Come up this once."
[1:19:49] In other words, this time it's working.
[1:19:52] &gt;&gt; For he has showed me what?
[1:19:55] &gt;&gt; All his heart.
[1:19:55] &gt;&gt; Was that all his heart?
[1:20:00] Was
[1:20:04] that everything?
[1:20:07] &gt;&gt; Keep that in mind. He has showed me all
[1:20:10] his heart because a mystery
[1:20:14] even if it's revealed
[1:20:21] &gt;&gt; there is still a what?
[1:20:22] &gt;&gt; Supernatural element.
[1:20:24] &gt;&gt; Supernatural element despite the re
[1:20:27] &gt;&gt; revelation. Amen.
[1:20:29] Glory, glory, glory.
[1:20:31] &gt;&gt; So when Dala heard what came up,
[1:20:34] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.
[1:20:34] &gt;&gt; she grabbed with the best that she can
[1:20:37] get.
[1:20:37] &gt;&gt; Uh-huh.
[1:20:39] &gt;&gt; Didn't know that that was God's bait.
[1:20:41] &gt;&gt; Wow. Amen.
[1:20:46] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together.
[1:20:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:48] &gt;&gt; She said, "Now we got it."
[1:20:51] &gt;&gt; Uh-huh.
[1:20:51] &gt;&gt; She didn't know that there is still a
[1:20:53] supernatural element.
[1:20:56] That's why the devil can read this seven
[1:20:59] seals book.
[1:21:00] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:21:03] [Applause]
[1:21:04] &gt;&gt; Anybody can read this message.
[1:21:06] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:21:07] &gt;&gt; But it doesn't mean they understand the
[1:21:09] message.
[1:21:09] &gt;&gt; That's right. That's exactly right.
[1:21:11] Amen.
[1:21:16] &gt;&gt; You can gain information.
[1:21:18] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:21:18] &gt;&gt; But not revelation.
[1:21:20] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:21:23] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Amen.
[1:21:25] &gt;&gt; Help me up my friend. I'm just waiting.
[1:21:27] There is an airplane in front of me. I'm
[1:21:28] moving slowly.
[1:21:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:30] &gt;&gt; We clear my friend.
[1:21:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:31] &gt;&gt; He says, "And when he told him all his
[1:21:34] heart,
[1:21:35] &gt;&gt; he has showed me all his heart. Then the
[1:21:37] Lord of the Philistine came up to her
[1:21:39] and brought what?
[1:21:40] &gt;&gt; Money.
[1:21:41] &gt;&gt; In water in their hand."
[1:21:42] &gt;&gt; So they were convinced that now the deal
[1:21:44] is done. Get your salary.
[1:21:49] &gt;&gt; We clear.
[1:21:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:51] &gt;&gt; And she made him sleep.
[1:21:55] upon her knees. Very dangerous.
[1:22:00] Let me leave it alone. Very dangerous.
[1:22:05] Hey, your meeting is next week.
[1:22:08] &gt;&gt; Okay, let me handle what I'm handling
[1:22:10] here. Okay.
[1:22:12] And she call for a man
[1:22:15] and she calls him to be what?
[1:22:17] &gt;&gt; To shave off
[1:22:18] &gt;&gt; shave off what?
[1:22:19] &gt;&gt; The seven locks of his hair.
[1:22:20] &gt;&gt; This hair has seven locks. Remember we
[1:22:23] went through this in the hotel. I'm
[1:22:25] trying to stay away from that and stay
[1:22:28] on my line. Okay.
[1:22:30] &gt;&gt; This hair, this supernatural hair
[1:22:33] &gt;&gt; have how many locks?
[1:22:34] &gt;&gt; Seven locks.
[1:22:35] &gt;&gt; Why only seven locks?
[1:22:42] &gt;&gt; Why only seven locks?
[1:22:45] &gt;&gt; What did he say?
[1:22:47] &gt;&gt; Seven angels.
[1:22:51] and say,
[1:22:52] &gt;&gt; "Are we together?"
[1:22:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:54] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Amen.
[1:22:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:59] &gt;&gt; And they shave off what? Seven locks of
[1:23:02] his head.
[1:23:03] &gt;&gt; These locks were seven individually.
[1:23:09] &gt;&gt; In other words, when you see Samson, you
[1:23:11] can count them. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
[1:23:22] &gt;&gt; Can you count this here?
[1:23:23] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:23:24] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:23:24] &gt;&gt; Can you see where where is the
[1:23:26] connection?
[1:23:27] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:23:28] &gt;&gt; This one.
[1:23:30] &gt;&gt; It's seven.
[1:23:31] &gt;&gt; But you cannot count them.
[1:23:33] &gt;&gt; They are blended.
[1:23:34] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:23:36] &gt;&gt; But the first hair of Samson was
[1:23:38] divided.
[1:23:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:45] Okay, go watch the sermon in the hotel.
[1:23:47] Amen.
[1:23:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:48] &gt;&gt; The first hair is divided.
[1:23:51] &gt;&gt; Lut
[1:23:54] &gt;&gt; Paul.
[1:23:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:55] &gt;&gt; Wesley
[1:23:56] &gt;&gt; and my Columbus Martin those are divided
[1:24:00] here.
[1:24:05] &gt;&gt; Thank you Jesus.
[1:24:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:07] &gt;&gt; Then the Lord of the uh where are we at?
[1:24:09] Verse 19. And she made him sleep upon
[1:24:12] her knee. And she called for a man. And
[1:24:15] she caused him to shave off the what?
[1:24:17] &gt;&gt; Seven locks of his head.
[1:24:19] &gt;&gt; And she began to afflict him. And his
[1:24:23] strength did what?
[1:24:24] &gt;&gt; Went from him.
[1:24:25] &gt;&gt; So when the hair left, what left?
[1:24:28] &gt;&gt; The strength.
[1:24:31] &gt;&gt; Because the hair you can refocus Adasa
[1:24:34] is connected to the strength.
[1:24:36] &gt;&gt; You remove hair,
[1:24:38] &gt;&gt; you remove strength. Uh-huh. But to
[1:24:41] begin with, where did the hair came
[1:24:43] from?

[1:24:49] hair coming from?
[1:24:50] &gt;&gt; We We go to the barber shop, we cut
[1:24:53] hair,
[1:24:54] &gt;&gt; then what happened?
[1:24:56] &gt;&gt; So where is the hair coming from?
[1:24:57] &gt;&gt; From within.
[1:24:58] &gt;&gt; They didn't go there.
[1:25:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:02] &gt;&gt; They cut the superficial.
[1:25:03] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:25:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:11] They should have went in the root.
[1:25:13] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:25:14] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:25:15] &gt;&gt; But the root hides life.
[1:25:17] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen.
[1:25:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.

[1:25:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:28] &gt;&gt; So when the enemy remove what he can
[1:25:30] see,
[1:25:31] &gt;&gt; he says, "You know what? I'm done with
[1:25:33] this guy."
[1:25:34] &gt;&gt; Uh-huh.
[1:25:34] &gt;&gt; Did he know the roots are there?
[1:25:36] &gt;&gt; Uh-huh. And if the roots are there

[1:25:50] &gt;&gt; Look how many things the devil tried to
[1:25:52] remove from your life.
[1:25:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:54] &gt;&gt; But he cannot touch the root.
[1:25:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right.
[1:25:57] &gt;&gt; Because the root bring resurrection.

[1:26:12] 20. And she said, "The Philistine be
[1:26:16] upon you, Samson."
[1:26:18] And he awoke out of sleep and say, "I
[1:26:21] will go out as as uh at other time
[1:26:26] presuming
[1:26:28] preach the message." Presumption uh I
[1:26:29] mean presuming and shake myself. And he
[1:26:33] knew not
[1:26:35] &gt;&gt; that what
[1:26:36] &gt;&gt; the Lord was departed from him.
[1:26:39] &gt;&gt; So the Lord was where
[1:26:42] &gt;&gt; was gone.
[1:26:44] &gt;&gt; The Lord have departed from whom
[1:26:47] &gt;&gt; Samson.
[1:26:48] &gt;&gt; So the Lord was where?
[1:26:52] &gt;&gt; So if you cut the hair, what happened to
[1:26:54] the Lord?
[1:26:56] &gt;&gt; What about if the hair come back?
[1:26:58] &gt;&gt; It come back.

[1:27:08] &gt;&gt; He leaves.
[1:27:09] &gt;&gt; And when the hair is back, what happened
[1:27:11] to the Lord?
[1:27:11] &gt;&gt; He comes back to
[1:27:15] [Music]
[1:27:18] &gt;&gt; So this
[1:27:20] So this hair is connected to the Lord.
[1:27:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:27] &gt;&gt; Elohim.
[1:27:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:30] capital L
[1:27:31] &gt;&gt; L O R D.
[1:27:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:37] &gt;&gt; The Philistine took the natural things
[1:27:39] off.
[1:27:41] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:27:41] &gt;&gt; They didn't know the supernatural
[1:27:44] secret.
[1:27:44] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:27:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:50] &gt;&gt; They should have shaved Samson and
[1:27:52] burned the root.
[1:27:54] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:27:57] &gt;&gt; But they left the root. Yeah,
[1:28:01] &gt;&gt; big mistake.
[1:28:04] &gt;&gt; We clear my friend.
[1:28:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:06] &gt;&gt; This reading is getting lengthy. I'm
[1:28:07] trying to move, my friend. We ready?
[1:28:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:10] &gt;&gt; Verse uh 21.
[1:28:15] &gt;&gt; But the Philistine took him and did
[1:28:18] what?
[1:28:19] &gt;&gt; Put out his eyes.
[1:28:21] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.
[1:28:22] &gt;&gt; Why they didn't cut the hand of Samson?
[1:28:27] &gt;&gt; I know, right?
[1:28:29] Please help me so we move.
[1:28:32] &gt;&gt; Why? Why the only inspiration
[1:28:35] &gt;&gt; that the Philistine can get is only his
[1:28:38] eyes.
[1:28:39] &gt;&gt; They didn't say, "Let's cut his ear."
[1:28:42] &gt;&gt; Or maybe, you know what? Let's cut his
[1:28:44] leg. Let's amputate his leg so he won't
[1:28:47] be able to walk.
[1:28:49] &gt;&gt; Or they could say, you know what, let's
[1:28:50] cut his arm so next time, even if his
[1:28:53] strength come, he won't know how to
[1:28:55] fight.
[1:28:56] But they left his arm.
[1:28:58] &gt;&gt; They left his feet.
[1:29:00] &gt;&gt; And they went and they attacked directly
[1:29:03] the eye.
[1:29:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. Why?
[1:29:08] &gt;&gt; Remember the problem of Samson is with
[1:29:11] women.
[1:29:12] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:29:17] &gt;&gt; Take your time.
[1:29:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:21] &gt;&gt; And women are connected to the eyes.
[1:29:24] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:29:30] Because Jesus said, "Whosoever lookth
[1:29:32] upon a woman
[1:29:34] &gt;&gt; and last upon her have already committed
[1:29:37] adultery with her in the heart."
[1:29:39] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:29:39] &gt;&gt; So the weakness of Samson was connected
[1:29:42] to his eyes.
[1:29:43] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:29:44] &gt;&gt; So God allowed that weakness to be
[1:29:46] carried out.
[1:29:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:52] In other words, Samson is changing
[1:29:55] season. Come on. Amen.
[1:29:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:05] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says this, my friend,
[1:30:08] in the message Jas and divine healing.
[1:30:11] He says, "The eye is what?
[1:30:13] &gt;&gt; The gate to the soul.
[1:30:17] a gate to water.
[1:30:18] &gt;&gt; That's all.
[1:30:22] &gt;&gt; So, it's a dangerous gate.
[1:30:24] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:30:25] &gt;&gt; And every time Samson a problem with a
[1:30:27] woman,
[1:30:28] &gt;&gt; a problem with a woman. A problem with a
[1:30:31] woman. God said, "No worry."
[1:30:34] &gt;&gt; When they caught him, he say, "Uh-uh,
[1:30:36] this time I'm going to deal with what
[1:30:38] caused you to get to this point."
[1:30:40] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:30:43] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:30:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. So God was pruning Samson.
[1:30:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. Come on.
[1:30:49] &gt;&gt; It is horrible.
[1:30:50] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.
[1:30:52] &gt;&gt; Take your time.
[1:30:55] &gt;&gt; Because Samson got two eyes.
[1:30:57] &gt;&gt; Uh-huh.
[1:30:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:59] &gt;&gt; And he got another eye.
[1:31:01] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:31:02] &gt;&gt; Which was a spiritual eye.
[1:31:04] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:31:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:09] &gt;&gt; The Bible says we walk by what?
[1:31:12] &gt;&gt; Faith, not by sight. Amen.
[1:31:14] &gt;&gt; It's faith.
[1:31:16] &gt;&gt; Verse is what?
[1:31:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:20] &gt;&gt; What they destroy was what?
[1:31:22] &gt;&gt; The fire.
[1:31:24] &gt;&gt; Uh-huh.
[1:31:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. By faith. Amen. That's right.
[1:31:33] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:31:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:35] &gt;&gt; Because faith may bring new eyes.
[1:31:37] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:31:39] &gt;&gt; Come on, Lord.
[1:31:44] Uh, help me please. Okay.
[1:31:47] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:31:48] &gt;&gt; Keep your finger where we are. I'm still
[1:31:50] reading the Bible.
[1:31:51] &gt;&gt; Go to the book of Hebrew 11.
[1:31:55] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:31:56] &gt;&gt; Go to Hebrew 11.
[1:32:01] &gt;&gt; Oh, God.
[1:32:04] &gt;&gt; You say I'm going to preach this, move
[1:32:05] on quick. Something else.
[1:32:09] [Laughter]
[1:32:10] Let's go to Hebrew 11. If you there, you
[1:32:13] can say amen.
[1:32:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:14] &gt;&gt; Go to verse 32, my friend. You there?
[1:32:18] &gt;&gt; The Bible say because Hebrew 11 is
[1:32:20] talking about the heroes of faith.
[1:32:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:23] &gt;&gt; And the Bible say through faith Enoch
[1:32:25] did this through this I mean Abraham and
[1:32:29] Moses and so we know all of them by
[1:32:31] faith by faith. By faith by faith. Okay.
[1:32:34] But today we talking about Samson.
[1:32:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:36] &gt;&gt; Okay. His eyes naturally.
[1:32:42] &gt;&gt; The Bible says in verse 32, "And what
[1:32:45] shall I more say?" Paul is continuing
[1:32:49] &gt;&gt; for the time will fail me.
[1:32:51] &gt;&gt; In other words, Paul is telling you
[1:32:52] there are more heroes.
[1:32:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:56] &gt;&gt; But I don't have time to go one by one.
[1:32:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:59] &gt;&gt; In other word, down the road, you fill
[1:33:01] in the blank.
[1:33:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:03] &gt;&gt; You can go back in the Bible and
[1:33:04] continue to pick them up.
[1:33:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right.
[1:33:07] &gt;&gt; In other words, Paul put a comma.
[1:33:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:10] &gt;&gt; And left the door so we can get there
[1:33:12] and continue.
[1:33:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:14] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:33:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:16] &gt;&gt; Paul says, "And then time will fail me
[1:33:19] to tell of who?"
[1:33:20] &gt;&gt; Gideon.
[1:33:21] &gt;&gt; Come on. And of who?
[1:33:23] &gt;&gt; And of who?
[1:33:24] &gt;&gt; Samson.
[1:33:25] &gt;&gt; So Samson is a hero of faith.
[1:33:27] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:33:28] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:33:29] &gt;&gt; We clear now.
[1:33:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:31] &gt;&gt; But we need to know Samson did what?
[1:33:33] Because Enoch by faith. Abraham by
[1:33:35] faith. Moses by faith.
[1:33:38] &gt;&gt; That's good.
[1:33:39] &gt;&gt; He says Samson come and who?
[1:33:41] &gt;&gt; Jeffa.
[1:33:42] &gt;&gt; Come and of who?
[1:33:43] &gt;&gt; David also.
[1:33:44] &gt;&gt; Uh-huh. Come and of who? And of what?
[1:33:47] &gt;&gt; The prophet.
[1:33:48] &gt;&gt; Now it's vague.
[1:33:49] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:33:49] &gt;&gt; It's open up the prophet. Plural.
[1:33:52] &gt;&gt; Whoever is prophet over there. You can
[1:33:54] take Joseph. You can take Jacob. You can
[1:33:56] put all of them up.
[1:33:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:57] &gt;&gt; And of the prophet who through what?
[1:34:00] &gt;&gt; Faith.
[1:34:01] &gt;&gt; Ah. So Samson have faith. Amen.
[1:34:04] &gt;&gt; Absolutely right.
[1:34:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:06] &gt;&gt; Samson, through faith.
[1:34:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:09] &gt;&gt; We clear now.
[1:34:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:10] &gt;&gt; Through faith did what?
[1:34:12] &gt;&gt; Subdued kingdoms
[1:34:13] &gt;&gt; and what?
[1:34:14] &gt;&gt; Wrought righteousness
[1:34:15] &gt;&gt; and what?
[1:34:16] &gt;&gt; Obtain promises
[1:34:17] &gt;&gt; and what?
[1:34:18] &gt;&gt; Stomp the mouths of lion.
[1:34:19] &gt;&gt; That's That's Daniel.
[1:34:21] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:34:22] &gt;&gt; And quench water.
[1:34:23] &gt;&gt; Violence of fire.
[1:34:24] &gt;&gt; This is Shadrach, Macho.
[1:34:27] You can fill in the blank. And did water
[1:34:30] &gt;&gt; escape the edge of the sword. And out of
[1:34:32] what?
[1:34:33] &gt;&gt; Weakness was made strong.
[1:34:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:34:40] &gt;&gt; Who became weakness
[1:34:42] &gt;&gt; who lost strength.
[1:34:44] &gt;&gt; But out of that weakness through faith,
[1:34:48] &gt;&gt; Samson became strong. Amen.
[1:34:52] &gt;&gt; Perception.
[1:34:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:57] &gt;&gt; Let's go back to the book of Judges. We
[1:34:59] understand that this his strength left
[1:35:02] him.
[1:35:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:03] &gt;&gt; Samson became
[1:35:06] weak.
[1:35:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. But Hebrew 11 just told us that
[1:35:12] Samson
[1:35:12] &gt;&gt; Uh-huh.
[1:35:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:15] &gt;&gt; Not through human natural.

[1:35:44] &gt;&gt; Took him
[1:35:44] &gt;&gt; and did water.
[1:35:45] &gt;&gt; Put out his eyes.
[1:35:46] &gt;&gt; And we found out brother Brandham is
[1:35:48] saying here that the eye is the soul to
[1:35:50] the water.
[1:35:51] &gt;&gt; Gave to the soul. Ah, brother Bam say
[1:35:54] five senses and the eye almost
[1:35:57] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.
[1:35:58] &gt;&gt; does what
[1:35:59] &gt;&gt; governs the others.
[1:36:00] &gt;&gt; In other words, among the five senses,
[1:36:03] the eyes dominate the other.
[1:36:06] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:36:10] &gt;&gt; Brother say you look at the Catholic
[1:36:14] Church.
[1:36:14] &gt;&gt; Uh-huh.
[1:36:15] &gt;&gt; Not a what? a long time ago

[1:36:26] &gt;&gt; The eye.
[1:36:27] &gt;&gt; The Catholic Church already understood

[1:36:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:33] &gt;&gt; They already understood the psychology
[1:36:36] behind the eye.
[1:36:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:37] &gt;&gt; That if you can put something really
[1:36:40] nice that look like this, you can catch
[1:36:42] the eye.
[1:36:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:45] And if you catch the eye, you catch the
[1:36:47] souls.
[1:36:48] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:36:49] &gt;&gt; And God say, you know what? Remove the
[1:36:52] eye.
[1:36:52] &gt;&gt; Uh-huh.
[1:36:55] &gt;&gt; If the eye is the gate to the soul.
[1:36:59] &gt;&gt; Uh-huh.
[1:36:59] &gt;&gt; And they remove the eye. They remove
[1:37:01] what?
[1:37:02] &gt;&gt; The gate.
[1:37:02] &gt;&gt; And if they remove the gate, what else
[1:37:04] entrance is there to the soul of Samson?
[1:37:07] &gt;&gt; Faith.
[1:37:08] &gt;&gt; No. How can you again get to the soul of
[1:37:10] Samson?
[1:37:12] &gt;&gt; You can't. It's finished.
[1:37:13] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.
[1:37:14] &gt;&gt; It's a road block.
[1:37:16] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:37:17] &gt;&gt; In other words, God put a blockage.
[1:37:20] &gt;&gt; Come on, Lord.
[1:37:20] &gt;&gt; To the soul of something. That's right.
[1:37:22] &gt;&gt; You can no longer touch the soul of

[1:37:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. God did that. Come on.
[1:37:30] &gt;&gt; In other words, Samson has moved from a
[1:37:32] season of attachable

[1:37:39] Yet this season to our perception of

[1:39:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:39:23] &gt;&gt; Where are we at, my friend?
[1:39:25] &gt;&gt; 20 20 21

[1:39:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:56] &gt;&gt; But the eyes has to be put up.
[1:39:58] &gt;&gt; It was God that allowed that
[1:40:00] inspiration.

[1:40:04] Amen.
[1:40:04] &gt;&gt; To go there like this is the only time I

[1:41:32] Brother, what's going on? I lost my
[1:41:33] hair. I lost my eyes.
[1:41:35] &gt;&gt; That's your perception.
[1:41:36] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:41:37] &gt;&gt; Your perception is limited.
[1:41:39] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:41:43] &gt;&gt; If you look, if you go outside, you look
[1:41:45] at the airplane,
[1:41:46] &gt;&gt; how does it look?
[1:41:48] &gt;&gt; Small.
[1:41:49] &gt;&gt; You can even put your hand.
[1:41:51] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:41:52] &gt;&gt; And you block the airplane.
[1:41:53] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:41:54] &gt;&gt; Is the airplane that small?
[1:41:55] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:41:56] &gt;&gt; Go to the airport. and watch the

[1:42:05] &gt;&gt; Your reality is a problem.
[1:42:08] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:42:11] &gt;&gt; Because, brother, I believe it by faith.
[1:42:15] &gt;&gt; I believe it. I believe God will do
[1:42:17] something. But in reality,
[1:42:19] &gt;&gt; Uh-huh.
[1:42:20] &gt;&gt; Uh, things are not better.
[1:42:21] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:42:22] &gt;&gt; In reality,
[1:42:23] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:42:24] &gt;&gt; your reality
[1:42:25] &gt;&gt; is limited.
[1:42:26] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:42:35] If I put a cologne
[1:42:36] &gt;&gt; Uh-huh.
[1:42:37] &gt;&gt; Can you smell my cologne?
[1:42:38] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:42:38] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:42:39] &gt;&gt; From with
[1:42:39] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:42:40] &gt;&gt; Can your eyes detect macolon?
[1:42:42] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:42:42] &gt;&gt; You need the other senses, the nose to
[1:42:46] detect your cologne.
[1:42:47] &gt;&gt; So why do you trust your eyes so much?
[1:42:50] &gt;&gt; Because your eyes is is so limited.
[1:42:52] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.
[1:42:52] &gt;&gt; Your eyes can say the food look good.

[1:42:56] beautiful. That's right.
[1:42:58] &gt;&gt; You need the tongue. That's right.

[1:43:04] &gt;&gt; Your senses are limited. That's right.
[1:43:07] &gt;&gt; Your perception is limited. That's why.

[1:43:40] &gt;&gt; Those senses.
[1:43:40] &gt;&gt; But they are given to you as a what?
[1:43:42] &gt;&gt; A gift.
[1:43:43] &gt;&gt; So the brother lost his gift.

[1:43:46] &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus.
[1:43:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:48] &gt;&gt; He says, "And it depends on how you

[1:44:02] &gt;&gt; your life is controlled with what
[1:44:05] &gt;&gt; and when they remove that set from
[1:44:08] Samson

[1:44:09] &gt;&gt; in other words the control have changed.
[1:44:11] &gt;&gt; That's right.

[1:44:16] &gt;&gt; from that day on must be led.
[1:44:19] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:44:21] There was a time you were leading
[1:44:22] yourself.

[1:44:59] the way you yield those what?"
[1:45:01] &gt;&gt; Five senses.
[1:45:02] &gt;&gt; You are.
[1:45:04] &gt;&gt; Uh-huh.
[1:45:07] &gt;&gt; You are
[1:45:09] &gt;&gt; what you see.
[1:45:17] You are

[1:45:23] &gt;&gt; What you hear,
[1:45:25] &gt;&gt; what you taste,

[1:45:30] &gt;&gt; In other words, you are your senses.
[1:45:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:39] &gt;&gt; Are we together?

[1:45:40] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Whatever those senses
[1:45:43] are what
[1:45:44] &gt;&gt; yielded to,
[1:45:45] &gt;&gt; they will do what?
[1:45:46] &gt;&gt; Dominate you.
[1:45:50] &gt;&gt; Those senses will do what?
[1:45:52] &gt;&gt; Dominate you.
[1:45:52] &gt;&gt; But we want to walk by faith.
[1:45:54] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:45:57] &gt;&gt; And not by sight.
[1:45:58] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:46:00] &gt;&gt; And the problem of Samson is the eye. So
[1:46:02] God went surgery.

[1:46:14] &gt;&gt; It doesn't work anymore. No,
[1:46:16] &gt;&gt; he's blind.
[1:46:17] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:46:17] &gt;&gt; Because some of us has been blind by the
[1:46:19] Holy Ghost.
[1:46:20] &gt;&gt; Uh-huh.
[1:46:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:23] &gt;&gt; It doesn't do anything.

[2:00:56] &gt;&gt; 22.
[2:00:57] &gt;&gt; However,

[2:01:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. Dala only knew if you shave
[2:01:13] &gt;&gt; the hair is the strength is gone.
[2:01:15] &gt;&gt; She didn't know that the hair have a
[2:01:17] resurrection.
[2:01:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:25] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:01:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.

[2:01:36] &gt;&gt; I'm using so you understand my English.
[2:01:38] and they his eyes.
[2:01:40] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.
[2:01:41] &gt;&gt; Huh. They thought they thought they
[2:01:45] thought there is no way
[2:01:47] &gt;&gt; this man can ever recover.
[2:01:49] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:01:53] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:01:54] &gt;&gt; They forgot to leave a barber.
[2:01:57] &gt;&gt; Uh-huh.
[2:01:58] &gt;&gt; At the prison. That's right.
[2:02:10] I hope we are together.
[2:02:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:11] &gt;&gt; So, so God knows how to distract the
[2:02:14] devil.
[2:02:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:15] &gt;&gt; And keep him busy on this side.
[2:02:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:18] &gt;&gt; And leave another door on the other
[2:02:20] side.
[2:02:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:24] &gt;&gt; In other words, if you ask the devil,
[2:02:26] what did you do to him?
[2:02:28] &gt;&gt; He's on medication.
[2:02:30] &gt;&gt; He's on medication.
[2:02:31] &gt;&gt; He's on medication.
[2:02:33] &gt;&gt; She's always depressed. She's always
[2:02:35] depressed. And God say, "No problem. The
[2:02:37] hair is growing."
[2:02:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:39] &gt;&gt; The hair is growing. The hair is
[2:02:41] growing. Until the time that the hair
[2:02:43] will take over.
[2:02:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:49] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:02:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:50] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:02:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:52] &gt;&gt; Where are we at, my friend?
[2:02:53] &gt;&gt; 22.
[2:02:54] &gt;&gt; However, the hair of his head begin to
[2:02:56] do water. you grow again
[2:02:57] &gt;&gt; after he was watered.
[2:02:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:02] &gt;&gt; If you notice,
[2:03:04] &gt;&gt; the hair don't grow in one day.
[2:03:07] &gt;&gt; No,
[2:03:09] &gt;&gt; it take a while
[2:03:11] &gt;&gt; for the hair to grow.
[2:03:12] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:03:12] &gt;&gt; But when they catch Samson and they cut
[2:03:15] his hair off, they didn't make a party.
[2:03:22] Because if they would have made a party,
[2:03:24] &gt;&gt; there was no hair on Samson.
[2:03:26] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:03:26] &gt;&gt; So for some reason, God
[2:03:30] &gt;&gt; Uh-huh.
[2:03:32] &gt;&gt; For some reason,
[2:03:34] &gt;&gt; God made all the venues of Gaza busy.
[2:03:37] That's why
[2:03:41] &gt;&gt; they needed a long time of preparation
[2:03:44] &gt;&gt; to bring everybody in. That's right.
[2:03:49] Amen.
[2:03:52] &gt;&gt; Perception
[2:03:53] versus discernment.
[2:03:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:58] &gt;&gt; When you are in the prison, God is
[2:04:00] working.
[2:04:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:02] &gt;&gt; God is working.
[2:04:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:07] &gt;&gt; Every morning.
[2:04:11] &gt;&gt; 1 2 3.

[2:04:20] &gt;&gt; God is working.
[2:04:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[2:04:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:30] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Are we together? For
[2:04:33] some reason they look they said the only
[2:04:35] way we can reunite everybody
[2:04:38] &gt;&gt; into the big stadium of Carolina Pentest
[2:04:45] &gt;&gt; so everybody can take their day off is
[2:04:48] this day
[2:04:49] &gt;&gt; and it matches with the hair.
[2:04:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:58] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:04:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:59] &gt;&gt; Where are we at my friend?
[2:05:02] Let's go to verse 23. I'm almost
[2:05:04] finished with I'm going to finish soon
[2:05:05] with this. He said, "Then the Lord of
[2:05:07] the Philistines did what?"
[2:05:08] &gt;&gt; Gathered them together.
[2:05:10] &gt;&gt; For what?
[2:05:11] &gt;&gt; To offer a great sacrifice
[2:05:13] &gt;&gt; to who?
[2:05:14] &gt;&gt; Unto dagon their god.
[2:05:16] &gt;&gt; And to do what?
[2:05:17] &gt;&gt; Rejoice.
[2:05:18] &gt;&gt; Why they didn't do it right away?
[2:05:20] &gt;&gt; Uh-huh.
[2:05:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:23] &gt;&gt; To rejoice. For they say what?
[2:05:27] &gt;&gt; Our God has what?
[2:05:28] &gt;&gt; Delivered Samson. Our enemy where
[2:05:30] &gt;&gt; into our hand.
[2:05:31] &gt;&gt; And when the people saw him, they did
[2:05:34] what?
[2:05:34] &gt;&gt; Praise their God.
[2:05:35] &gt;&gt; For they say our God has done what?
[2:05:38] &gt;&gt; Delivered into our hands our enemy.
[2:05:40] &gt;&gt; And the destroyer of what?
[2:05:42] &gt;&gt; Our country.
[2:05:42] &gt;&gt; Which?
[2:05:43] &gt;&gt; Many of us.
[2:05:44] &gt;&gt; He threw how many?
[2:05:46] &gt;&gt; Many.
[2:05:46] &gt;&gt; He didn't all.
[2:05:48] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:05:48] &gt;&gt; He threw many.
[2:05:49] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:05:50] &gt;&gt; And he clear.
[2:05:53] &gt;&gt; We clear.
[2:05:55] &gt;&gt; Verse 25. And it came to pass when their
[2:05:58] heart was what? Mary
[2:06:00] &gt;&gt; and they say do what?
[2:06:01] &gt;&gt; Call for Samson.
[2:06:03] &gt;&gt; That he may make us what?
[2:06:05] &gt;&gt; In other words, call him so he can
[2:06:07] entertain us.
[2:06:08] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:06:10] &gt;&gt; A wonderful entertainment is coming.
[2:06:19] &gt;&gt; Who put him in prison?
[2:06:22] &gt;&gt; Who is removing him from the prison? The
[2:06:25] same people that brought him to prison
[2:06:27] begin to bring him out of the prison.
[2:06:29] &gt;&gt; They were bringing him out of the prison
[2:06:32] for entertainment.
[2:06:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:06:37] &gt;&gt; But they didn't see what was going on
[2:06:39] here.
[2:06:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:06:42] &gt;&gt; They see a man moving on like this.
[2:06:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:06:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:06:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:06:48] &gt;&gt; Where are we at, my friend?
[2:06:51] &gt;&gt; 24.
[2:06:51] &gt;&gt; 25. And they call for something out of
[2:06:54] what?
[2:06:55] &gt;&gt; The prison house. And made them what?
[2:06:58] &gt;&gt; Sport.

[2:07:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:05] &gt;&gt; Can Samson see?
[2:07:06] &gt;&gt; No.
[2:07:08] &gt;&gt; He can only feel.
[2:07:09] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:07:10] &gt;&gt; And they took him and they put him
[2:07:12] beside the pillars.
[2:07:13] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:07:14] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:07:15] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:07:16] &gt;&gt; When his hand touched the pillars,
[2:07:18] &gt;&gt; Uh-huh.
[2:07:20] A revelation striking.
[2:07:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:26] &gt;&gt; In other words, when Samson was making
[2:07:29] sport,
[2:07:30] &gt;&gt; God was already there.
[2:07:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:33] &gt;&gt; Because God is with the hair.
[2:07:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:42] &gt;&gt; When the hair, my friend, when they cut
[2:07:45] the hair, what happened to the Lord?
[2:07:47] So when the hair was back in prison,
[2:07:49] where was God?
[2:07:51] &gt;&gt; God was where
[2:07:53] &gt;&gt; in prison.
[2:07:54] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:07:55] &gt;&gt; So in the prison, God is there.
[2:07:56] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:07:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:59] &gt;&gt; In the grounding, God is there.
[2:08:02] &gt;&gt; But God has a plan.
[2:08:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.

[2:08:27] &gt;&gt; Let the enemy think they got you.
[2:08:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:08:30] &gt;&gt; I am there. Amen.
[2:08:35] &gt;&gt; And maybe you come to Samson, you say,
[2:08:37] "Samson, how you doing?" When he fell
[2:08:39] his head, he say, "I'm doing good."

[2:09:17] miserable.
[2:09:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.

[2:09:35] &gt;&gt; Where are we at, my friend?
[2:09:36] &gt;&gt; 26.
[2:09:37] &gt;&gt; 26. He says, "And Samson said to the lad
[2:09:42] &gt;&gt; that held him by what?"
[2:09:43] &gt;&gt; The hand.
[2:09:44] &gt;&gt; He was held by what?
[2:09:46] &gt;&gt; The hand.
[2:09:46] &gt;&gt; By a lad.
[2:09:47] &gt;&gt; That's right.

[2:09:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:10:00] &gt;&gt; It was a boy that was leading him. Amen.
[2:10:02] And a boy was leading him. But and the

[2:10:10] held him by the hand look who was
[2:10:12] holding him

[2:10:14] &gt;&gt; No
[2:10:15] &gt;&gt; a what?
[2:10:15] &gt;&gt; A younger person.
[2:10:17] &gt;&gt; A child. Not a mature a child.
[2:10:19] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.
[2:10:19] &gt;&gt; He begin to be led by a child.
[2:10:21] &gt;&gt; Uh-huh.
[2:10:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:10:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:10:24] &gt;&gt; The Bible says that he says to the lad,
[2:10:29] "Allow me that I may fill the what?
[2:10:31] pillars
[2:10:32] &gt;&gt; were upon the house water standing. So
[2:10:35] when Samson blind

[2:11:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:11:13] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:11:16] &gt;&gt; He begin to borrow the eye of a boy.
[2:11:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:11:21] &gt;&gt; Are we there?
[2:11:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:11:24] &gt;&gt; Are we there?
[2:11:26] He says
[2:11:27] &gt;&gt; where uh verse 26 allow me that I may
[2:11:30] fill the water
[2:11:31] &gt;&gt; the pillars
[2:11:32] &gt;&gt; where upon the water

[2:11:34] &gt;&gt; that I may lean upon them.
[2:11:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:11:37] &gt;&gt; So who told Samson
[2:11:40] &gt;&gt; the structure of that arena?
[2:11:43] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[2:11:45] &gt;&gt; I'm asking you a question.
[2:11:47] &gt;&gt; How did Samson know
[2:11:49] &gt;&gt; that the way they built Carolina Pantis
[2:11:51] there is only two pillows. If you touch
[2:11:54] them,
[2:11:55] &gt;&gt; that's it.
[2:11:57] &gt;&gt; Who gave him the plan?
[2:12:02] &gt;&gt; Where did he get the plan of the
[2:12:04] building?
[2:12:06] &gt;&gt; To know that this entire building rest
[2:12:09] only upon two.
[2:12:10] &gt;&gt; And the Bible say by faith.
[2:12:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:12:15] &gt;&gt; Samson by faith.
[2:12:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:12:18] &gt;&gt; In other words, God taught him.
[2:12:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:12:23] that this entire thing rested in two.
[2:12:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:12:31] &gt;&gt; Even if you bring the plan, you say,
[2:12:33] "Samson, this is the plan."
[2:12:35] &gt;&gt; Can he see your plan?
[2:12:36] &gt;&gt; So, he got to go by divine inspiration.
[2:12:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:12:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:12:42] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:12:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:12:43] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:12:44] &gt;&gt; The Bible says what?
[2:12:46] &gt;&gt; Where where are we at?
[2:12:47] &gt;&gt; 27.
[2:12:48] &gt;&gt; 27. Now the house was how
[2:12:50] &gt;&gt; full of men and women
[2:12:52] &gt;&gt; and all or some no all.
[2:12:57] &gt;&gt; How many lord of the Philistine were
[2:12:58] there?
[2:12:59] &gt;&gt; All of them.
[2:13:00] &gt;&gt; All of them.
[2:13:03] &gt;&gt; You didn't get it.
[2:13:05] &gt;&gt; How many demon were there?
[2:13:08] &gt;&gt; All of them.
[2:13:10] &gt;&gt; How many demon that trouble your life
[2:13:13] will be?
[2:13:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. Come on.
[2:13:18] Amen.
[2:13:18] &gt;&gt; The chief demon, the small demon. Amen.
[2:13:22] &gt;&gt; The what? Whatever type of demon. Amen.
[2:13:24] &gt;&gt; Put him there.
[2:13:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:13:26] &gt;&gt; Bring him to the cross.
[2:13:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:13:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:13:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:13:34] &gt;&gt; In other words, if Samson would have
[2:13:38] rely in everything I describe here, he
[2:13:41] would have missed his season. That's
[2:13:43] right.
[2:13:45] Amen.
[2:13:47] &gt;&gt; I hope you are together.
[2:13:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:13:49] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together.
[2:13:51] &gt;&gt; The Bible says verse 27, now the house
[2:13:53] was how
[2:13:54] &gt;&gt; full of men and women
[2:13:55] &gt;&gt; pack and all the what?
[2:13:57] &gt;&gt; Lords of the Philistines were there

[2:21:06] It means season has a message.
[2:21:08] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:21:12] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:21:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:21:13] &gt;&gt; It means season have a a a a it's a
[2:21:17] symbol
[2:21:19] &gt;&gt; that need to be decoded.
[2:21:21] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:21:22] &gt;&gt; In other words, it's not just season.
[2:21:24] &gt;&gt; No,
[2:21:25] &gt;&gt; there is a message with a season.
[2:21:27] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:21:28] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:21:28] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:21:29] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:21:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. And the discernment of Issachar
[2:21:33] does not stop on the fact that I'm only
[2:21:37] discerning.
[2:21:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:21:39] &gt;&gt; And that's it.
[2:21:41] &gt;&gt; The discernment
[2:21:43] lead
[2:21:44] to execution.
[2:21:46] &gt;&gt; That's right.

[2:22:22] &gt;&gt; like Samson
[2:22:23] &gt;&gt; and you don't read it correctly,
[2:22:27] &gt;&gt; you will miss what the season is
[2:22:29] actually bringing.
[2:22:30] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:22:32] &gt;&gt; Because the season bring a package.
[2:22:35] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:22:39] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:22:41] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:22:42] &gt;&gt; Brother Brham says this. He says now our
[2:22:46] what
[2:22:47] &gt;&gt; eternal destination
[2:22:48] &gt;&gt; is what
[2:22:49] &gt;&gt; now altogether determined
[2:22:50] &gt;&gt; determined by what we
[2:22:52] &gt;&gt; see
[2:22:53] &gt;&gt; perception or what
[2:22:54] &gt;&gt; what we hear
[2:22:55] &gt;&gt; perception because perception got our
[2:22:57] five senses
[2:22:58] &gt;&gt; but it's determined on what
[2:23:00] &gt;&gt; discernment we have
[2:23:02] &gt;&gt; the discernment you have on what you
[2:23:04] what
[2:23:04] &gt;&gt; we see
[2:23:05] &gt;&gt; and what you what
[2:23:06] &gt;&gt; we hear
[2:23:07] &gt;&gt; so when you see Samson
[2:23:08] &gt;&gt; Uh-huh.
[2:23:09] &gt;&gt; When you look at Samson
[2:23:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:23:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. What do you see?
[2:23:15] &gt;&gt; Uh-huh.
[2:23:16] &gt;&gt; One will say, "I see a man without eye.
[2:23:19] &gt;&gt; I see a man that have lost his eye. I
[2:23:22] see a man that is in darkness. I see a
[2:23:25] man that is in prison. I see a man that
[2:23:27] is troubling." But we just went with you
[2:23:29] right here.
[2:23:29] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:23:30] &gt;&gt; When you begin to discern, you begin to
[2:23:33] see that it's a different message all
[2:23:36] together.
[2:23:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:23:37] &gt;&gt; Based on what you discern.
[2:23:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:23:39] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:23:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:23:41] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:23:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:23:43] The Bible says to everything there is
[2:23:45] what?
[2:23:46] &gt;&gt; A season.
[2:23:47] &gt;&gt; So season brings something.
[2:23:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:23:54] &gt;&gt; Uh-huh.
[2:23:56] &gt;&gt; Let me go back again.
[2:23:58] &gt;&gt; To everything there is what?
[2:24:00] &gt;&gt; A season.
[2:24:00] &gt;&gt; So a season is always connected with
[2:24:03] something. That's right.
[2:24:08] &gt;&gt; Let me start it again.
[2:24:10] &gt;&gt; If not, we close. I see you next Sunday.
[2:24:12] To everything there is what?
[2:24:14] &gt;&gt; A season.
[2:24:14] &gt;&gt; So if the season happen, there must be
[2:24:16] something there.
[2:24:17] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:24:18] &gt;&gt; That's why it's important to decode.
[2:24:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:24:22] &gt;&gt; The season.
[2:24:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:24:24] &gt;&gt; Because I need to get what is there.
[2:24:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right.
[2:24:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.

[2:24:41] &gt;&gt; you will be happy.
[2:24:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:24:42] &gt;&gt; Because you know that guess what life is
[2:24:44] coming, the crops are coming and this
[2:24:46] this this you are. But if they tell you
[2:24:48] it's winter,
[2:24:51] &gt;&gt; you see the way you just reacted
[2:24:53] &gt;&gt; because it's winter.
[2:24:55] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:24:57] &gt;&gt; But even winter got something.
[2:25:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:25:04] I don't know if we together. If they
[2:25:06] tell you Samson in the season of the
[2:25:09] sight and the seven locks,

[2:25:20] that.
[2:25:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:25:21] &gt;&gt; But what what if they tell you Samson in
[2:25:24] the season where the eyes are not?
[2:25:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:25:27] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.
[2:25:28] That season is the season that even
[2:25:30] brought more victory.
[2:25:32] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:25:32] &gt;&gt; When the eyes were gone.
[2:25:34] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:25:35] &gt;&gt; When the prophet is no longer there.
[2:25:37] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:25:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.

[2:26:39] &gt;&gt; Brother, I'm telling you, if brother was
[2:26:41] here,
[2:26:42] &gt;&gt; I could be in Jeffersonville.
[2:26:44] &gt;&gt; I will sit and say, "Brother, brotherh,

[2:54:52] price.
[2:54:53] &gt;&gt; He said, "Wait a minute. In CO, you were
[2:54:55] slow.
[2:54:57] &gt;&gt; No one was here to rent your facility.
[2:54:59] We were the one that keep you a layup.
[2:55:01] The d kept you alive." Amen.
[2:55:03] &gt;&gt; Now you change on us. Say, "No, no, no,
[2:55:06] no, no. Everything went up.
[2:55:08] &gt;&gt; There's two ways. You can get upset from
[2:55:10] the M
[2:55:11] &gt;&gt; or you can decode the message."
[2:55:15] When it happened to me, I said, "Brother
[2:55:18] Robert, brother Robert said, brother
[2:55:20] Steven, there was a pharaoh who didn't
[2:55:24] know Joseph.
[2:55:30] In other words, a season has opened up."
[2:55:33] &gt;&gt; In other words, it was the season to
[2:55:35] leave.
[2:55:41] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Are we together?
[2:55:44] &gt;&gt; Depending on how you look at and
[2:55:46] suddenly that money that money that
[2:55:49] money and look at the that money there's
[2:55:52] a building there.
[2:55:53] &gt;&gt; How much is it? That money building that
[2:55:56] money building and it happened all the
[2:55:58] same time.
[2:56:00] &gt;&gt; What do you think? Am I decoding?
[2:56:04] &gt;&gt; Hey, get the money. Get the building. As
[2:56:07] soon as we left the building, the
[2:56:09] manager quit.
[2:56:15] What are you understanding?
[2:56:18] The manager quit. They brought a new
[2:56:21] manager. She called us. She said, "Come
[2:56:23] back. We decrease the price."
[2:56:28] &gt;&gt; Now the money we were paying begin to do
[2:56:30] work here.
[2:56:32] &gt;&gt; It depends on how you interpreting.
[2:56:36] &gt;&gt; What are you perceiving? I'm perceiving
[2:56:39] a time to go. I'm receiving a time that
[2:56:43] God is telling me move on.
[2:56:50] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Are we together
[2:56:53] &gt;&gt; today? Because I gave the testimony.
[2:56:55] Who's going to get mad on that manager?
[2:56:58] &gt;&gt; The manager become a blessing.
[2:57:01] &gt;&gt; At that time, she was a curs.
[2:57:05] &gt;&gt; So everything the devil is bringing to
[2:57:07] you
[2:57:09] &gt;&gt; that seems bad. One of these days you
[2:57:12] will say surely all things work together
[2:57:16] for good. I see it now. What I thought
[2:57:20] was bad, I finally understood it was for
[2:57:23] my good.
[2:57:26] Hallelujah.
[2:57:26] &gt;&gt; It was God who was changing season.
[2:57:29] Let's stop here my friend. Let's stand
[2:57:32] because this anointing keep moving.
[2:57:35] Hallelujah.
[2:57:37] Hallelujah.

[2:59:56] &gt;&gt; Somebody has been delivered. Somebody
[3:00:00] have been encouraged. Somebody have been
[3:00:03] guided to remove the eyes from a limited

[3:01:04] hand. May you protect us and may your
