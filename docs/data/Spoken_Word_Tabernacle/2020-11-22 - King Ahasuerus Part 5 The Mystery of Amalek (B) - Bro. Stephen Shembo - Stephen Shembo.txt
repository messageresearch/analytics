TRANSCRIPT
========================================
back and it is also written jesus defeated this has defeated satan without using any divine gift divine gift that he had showing that there the what when you are in the valley he is not the god of the hill only he is also the god of death even when you are weak when i am weak than i am [Applause] that the weakest christian can defeat satan on the word of what that's the reason that i tried to get before the person nothing in the individual the preacher it is in and christ is in his so when you are low when you don't feel like the anointing is around you like god is listening to your prayer stick to the word stick to the word because that word will defeat the devil when you are in your weakest spot are you there so when you go through the valley amalek is there remember the formula because it's the same yesterday today and forever whatever he used the first time will always be good to be used any time he's not only the god of the hill he is also the god of the valley amen the enemy is going to study our strategy with the world he knows that jesus gave us the secret when he come use the word brother branham say satan will study now you how you are moving with the world are you okay all right now satan studied that all so perfectly till when he come to eve the best strategy he could use upon her and that was the reason that was to do what to reason with the word now you never want to reason with god's word just believe don't try to don't try to you cannot figure it out god so god is there it is just meant to do what [Applause] don't stress yourself in the valley relax believe the world don't reason with the word how is this going to happen you are opening the door for a marmalade to kill you where you are [Music] hallelujah amen amalek what is the origin of amalek take genesis 36 hallelujah i'm watching time just be relaxed i know where we stop so that should remove that pressure for the weak one who are struggling so your god is mindful he already got everything under control with your pastor genesis chapter 36 verse 12. everybody there brother john caught this and timna was conquering to elephants he saw amen and she brought to elephants who these were the sons of other jesus so amalek comes from which lineage i will have a storm will come out of jacob are you there that star won't destroy his soul but after he saw it's going to kill her do you understand now because amalek came from the lineage of who so now mordecai a jew fighting with agar gate heaven which is an amalekite which is of itself in other words the fight between jacob and esau are drawn right there you okay now brother branham said the word have two forces the two sons of who jacob esau and jacob now we found out that amalek comes from esau from the lineage of esau take genesis 25. hallelujah genesis 25 verse 22. you there rebecca is pregnant with this pregnancy trouble trouble trouble trouble trouble trouble say wait a minute i'm tired of this let me go ask the lord and god is answering verse 22 and the children struggle together inside the battle was within rebecca rebecca is a woman which is a top officer and the brother is within the church amen esau and jacob are fighting within the church amen and mordecai fighting within the kingdom amen the old battle is going to the end and the lord and the lord verse 23 and the lord said to her to what every nation have a national spirit [Music] so two spirits are fighting the men can die by that spirit move on to the next two nations are in your womb and two money of what it's two different people too many of people shall be what separated from your vows and the one people shall be what you gather now stronger than the other people and the elder shall serve there so this battle of mordecai and heaven the victory is already being prophesied you with me so when you fight with amalek remember it is already been speaking that amalek will be your footstep amen don't fight with him like who's gonna win i was already being told i'm gonna win are you with me i am fighting like a champion because we already know the women from the beginning because now we're finding out that this battle between mordecai and airmen is not the battle between mordecai and amen it is the battle between esau and jacob amen the world today is gripped by the two forces two great religious forces that is soon coming to the head or a showdown it is well represented in our scripture reading tonight of the two sons of isaac esau and and when they represent both these forces and they both come from the same father and same mother the holy one that was for dead of god isaac and was told by god to his father 25 years before he was born he would have a child by a separated and consecrated mother rebecca a virgin and these two son was in the same womb they came to the world fasting and at war with each other and they have been at war with each other ever since and will be tilled there so if you are in the end time that war is there amen are we there struggle between esau and jacob everybody god take deuteronomy 25 now we good amen deuteronomy 25 before we move forward you're going to understand this battle then you're going to get when esther is coming up to finish the battle the battle is finished by esther with mordechai it started a long time i'm gonna fight with amalek from generation to generation but who's gonna finish the battle with amalek you see now you see your mission in this dam we need to finish it battle and finish [Applause] business are you there we're going to finish some business [Music] deuteronomy 25 yeah amen verse 17. are you there remember what did to you by the way when you were come fourth out of egypt are you ready are you awake are you ready watch what is coming up verse 18 how he met you by the way and smote the what what does he mean are you there are you there when amalek approaches you he approaches from the back okay now he doesn't face you he doesn't come to you and says sister i have a problem i saw you sad is there any problem no he always goes to the back he bites from the back he bites from the back he bites back let's go back again you flip it back body that's right amalek okay how he met you by the way and smote the hand most the back of you so who is in the back why is he attacking in the back israel is going instead of amalek coming from the front amalek comes from the back why is zamalek going in the back you ready karma even all they are explaining you the back even all that way what you okay now am i like fight when you are feeble am i like when jesus was tired amalek fought when saul was almost dead he always attacked the feeble one when amalek comes to church he will attack the feeble one and he will attack from the back i don't want this to go to the pastor this is just between me and you what do you think about this bring it to the head amen he said the hindmost even all there were fever behind you when you were fed and what do you see when i lake attack when you are tired when you are when you are in the valley even all there were fibo behind you when you were fed you were exhausted and weary sister gene and feel not god hallelujah the scripture is explaining to us here that when amalek attacked he attacked from the back and when he attacked from the back he will attack those that are fibo those that are exhausted those that are going through trial too many difficulties he attacked them and the scripture is explaining that by attacking the fibo he didn't fear god amen now i'm gonna spare you this scripture amalek israel is moving amalek is attacking on the back because on the back you have fibo those that are uh those that are or what's struggling now go to exodus chapter 14. i can't miss it i'm sorry take exodus chapter 14. you got to see this when israel was marching to the promised land israel has a god heavy god do you know who was before israel there was something that was moving before israel when he moved to the right he moved to the right when he moved to the left are you there so in front of israel there was a guide he was called the angel of the lord and he was marching himself leading israel so when amalek sees where they don't they cannot face him from the front that's right amen because the pillar of fire is ready are you okay now you okay now you okay now amalek attack hallelujah take exodus chapter 14 oh my god amen exodus chapter 14 verse 10 if you dare you can say amen when pharaoh juvenile the children of israel lift up their eyes and behold the egyptian march after them and they were so afraid and the children of israel cried out to the lord everybody kill you there jump to verse 19. everybody there and the angel of the lord everybody there why the robert caught it again which one before the camp that's why america don't face it you okay now we move and wait what [Music] are you there i am not only the god of the hill i am also the god of the valley amen when trouble arrives the pillar of fire say wait he moved from the front and he back up from the back and then he first says amalek are you there oh my god the angel of the lord which went before the camp of israel we moved and went behind and the pillar of cloud went from before their face and stood what egypt is attacking the pillar of fire say okay up here then what is he doing now verse 19 and he came between the camp of the egyptian and the camp of israel and it was a cloud and darkness to them but he gave what by to this so this was a problem israel need to move on are you there israel is in the valley amen the egyptian are attacking when they attack they're coming from the back the pillar of fire say wait a minute i'm not the god of the hill let me show him that i'm the god of the valley and then we move back when he moved back he bring darkness to them are you there because it's dark he the pearl of fire on his back it's darkness then on this side he illuminates the way so israel can see and begin to move on that's why david say though i am in the valley of the shadow of what when you have a shadow there is a light are you there are you there you cannot have a shadow without a light are you there so even though you go into trouble the pillar of fire is right there blocking the camp and letting you move up are we there [Applause] but he gave light by night to this so that the one came not near to the other oh in other words he's blocking the way don't touch them that's why the scriptures say even though you go through fire the fire will not will not touch you even though you go through water the water will not do what they're not gonna offer those in other words you're gonna go through it but know that i am blocking so that they don't touch you hallelujah go to isaiah 52. yeah few minutes i don't know how many series we're going to have because this is rich go to isaiah 52. i thought i'm going to get somewhere isaiah 52 you need to understand this battle then we're going to come back to wester and see how to finish it isaiah 52 verse 11 you there depart you depart you go you out from there touch not the unclean thing sounds like revelation 18 brother robin go you out of the midst of her be you what clean that builder the vessels of the lord the priest and we saw here that's delivered where the blood god say move away from among them you the handle the staff of god get out verse 12 for you shall not go out with haste don't be under pressure no by flight you're not gonna run from the enemy like that amen if you see somebody a dog come the first thing you have is run but if you see a dog running somebody's walking like this in other words the dog is not doing me anything god said don't run don't even rush just calm down amen 52 why do you calm down verse for the lord will go before you everybody see that and the god of israel will be your your real god not only is god going before you just remember he's also guarding your back when mariam and aaron were gossiping about moses moses was not dead but god was there and god struck them because god was watching the back of moses isaiah 58 verse 8 are you there then shall your light break for thursday morning and your health shall spring up for speedily sister gene you okay and your righteousness shall go before you and the pillar of fire is the glory of the lord and the glory of the lord shall be uh in other words the pillar of fire shall be your protection you okay now amalek attacked from the back and god said because they are attacking you from the back they are not fearing me why they don't feel me brother obama say not only do we in this day are guilty of the same crime they are discerning the body of the lord that paul was rebuking the corinthian church for but of trying to do something that the lord has commanded without discerning the body of the and the body of the lord is there [Music] you okay now so when amalek was attacking the children of god from the back god saw that they are not discerning the body of the lord i have done so many things in egypt i have destroyed egypt these people should be afraid that don't touch those folks because their god is muddy but because they didn't discern the body of the lord they didn't discern the children of god they didn't discern the church of the living god they didn't discern the children that are filled with the holy spirit they don't care about the anointing they can kill saul without any remorse amen they don't have respect from god god said i know what to do i'm going to wipe them completely but they attack usually from the back you people we fought these sawblade tempers that is always padding off in the mouth at somebody can put up and things like that be careful you are guilty if you speak a word against your brother that is not right because a malachite backbite not just go around and tear down it you don't have to stick a knife in a man's back to kill him you can break his character and kill him kill his influence speak against your pastor here say something bad about him you just might as well as shoot him told something that was not right about him well he shall kill his influence with the people and things like that and you are guilty of it there is something matthew 18 go see your brother go see your sister when you attack from the back it's a sign of an amalekite are you there they hated him because they were jealous of him that's the only reason they were jealous they were trying to destroy his influence before the people the same as they are doing now if they can destroy the influence of them a malachite amalekite amalekite if they can destroy the influence of them before their amalekite then they have got they think if they can just destroy the influence of the message just know they disarm you amen amen take second soul samuel chapter four and i'm gonna head to finish and then we're gonna continue again second samuel chapter four this man came and i'm gonna finish my alarm is getting dirty second samuel chapter four verse nine this man came from the camp of seoul he was an amalekite infiltrated the camp came and brought the crown brought to the thing very respectful yes yes yes yes my lord yes look at this this this this the kingdom is yours amen what was he looking for david is going gonna explain to us ii samuel chapter four verse nine if you're there you can say amen and david answer wacom and banner his brother the sons of remo they bear on the tide and say to them as the lord liveth who has redeemed my soul out of all adversity when one told me david is referring to that person when one told me saying behold saul is dead are you there thinking to have brought good news good timing when he speak about tragedy he looks like he's a cnn he's bringing breaking news did you hear did you hear amen thinking that he was big he has brought good tiding i took a hold of him and slew him david kill him in zieglag who thought are you following me that i would have given him er for his so the man was coming to david bringing him the news because he needed a reward an amalekite is political an amalekite is after rewards are you there let's finish here to find out malek the hand of moses must be up are you following me amen to fight amalek require a constant prayer life amen amen when your prayer life goes down watch out for malik amen you must keep yourself prayed up [Music] jesus fought he was coming from a 40 days prayer [Music] he could withstand amalek brother the word is at the end of the age only in the crust are you saved i am not saying that to scare you i am just saying it i am saying it just as sadly as i know how to stand here in this platform and say but my heart has been stirred for a time and i know that we are ready for something now coming in and you christian don't stay in that lukewarm condition anymore you did it before the world is changing lay aside everything just get as close to god as you can walk with him talk with him let everything be secondary we bought you all [Music] back to your prayer life in other words accept your prayer life stay right with him all the time now i don't know why you're stopping my speech to say that but i could prove that i'd be willing to say that that is the spirit of god there that is speaking right now a warning to you that's right remember i'm saying that under the anointing of the spirit of god under the anointing of the spirit of god don't let your prayer life be secondary because when we're going to go back to the book of esther you'll find out that mordecai next fasted amen to fight a man are you there brother branham if you watch nature you shall see god and they shall have a wild dog in the country and they eat the deer they would come pack pack dogs and they overtake the deers and one of the things they do is to cut the line what we call hamstring in the back this muscle are you so when the dog attack the deer they usually get him here and break this why do they break this are you there brother one of them say and just cut the whole pack then they can run so the running muscle is in the upstream so when the the wolf attack they usually get here and pull the upstream then they the deer amen when the deer is crippling he cannot run then they overtake him what is the abstract what is steven those dogs will eat as much as they can pulling the aspirin then the other can pull away very much they are crippled and then they are easier praying than to run right back and get them that is the way the devil does he will cut off from your prayer meeting you okay please don't cut the hamstring right there so when you are not praying enough just know your arm strings have been cut the hand of moses are going down now amalek is getting power are we okay please don't cut the hamstring right then you shall pull around from this church to do that you shall run from here today but at any time the devil wants to gobble you up he's got you under his because your prayer life is crippled are you there when he cuts your prayer life brother you are what you see that you need to understand amalek when he cut that test of you and perverted into the things of the world no more prayer life you are seeking the things of the world he's got you where he wants you to he we've got you where he wants you he will let you gobble up along till you get to a certain place like so then what crush your life out without god ready he lets all soul went until he went to the witch when he was weak that's when the amalekite was standing right there and slew saw are you there what is your take-home message sometimes we got off on tension somewhere and not think about god not pray over it ask the lord whether we should do it or not and we found out that our supplier of blessing is cut off then we wonder sometimes well wonder why i can't get and i can't have no more blessing you don't watch you let down in you you say well i'm a christian well that is more sun you should pray more than ever read the bible every day pray don't make any decision too harshly or too quickly without first considering god about it ask him shall i do this father ask him is it your will for me to do this then see what the spirit will speak to you he might not give you a vision but he will speak in some way to you to let you know if you are sincere and ask him amen to beat amalek you must have a prayer life we have come to kurdish barnia brother poland when god has given the issue to the church to call to a heart back to your prayer life back to your consecration back to a spot that we consecrate ourself away from the things of the world away from our leader petty differences among and get back to god and brotherly love and humility back to the power of god again let's stop rudy let's stand here amen i'm sorry i went six minutes over let's pray heavenly father lord we thank you again for your grace for your love and your mercy father you told us this morning that to overcome we must recognize the devil in all his tactics lord father you have spoken to us showing us many aspects of

the same devil we are dealing with him lord the tactics are still the same attacking from the back waiting when we are feeble to attack and to destroy our life and the life of our children lord father
