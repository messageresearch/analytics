it's going to be but there will be an appreciation dinner for all the church workers so that will be on December the 25th we don't celebrate Christmas but it's going to fall on Christmas day so since we don't fall we don't celebrate Christmas the the place will be announced is just to show a lot of appreciation for the people that have been working because when you come to this church somebody is opening the door somebody's turning the light on somebody's looking over the camera somebody is playing the instrument somebody's cleaning the church all these kind of things has been going on to make the service happen amen so we want to show an appreciation that will be on December the 25th at 3:00 we will let you know where that will be so special thanks to brother Kelly brother Kaleb and brother um Charles Jr they work hard and Elijah they work harder yesterday little Elijah is right there we can't forget you amen they work harder yesterday to clean up the back over there so just four people and they did and they got the job done so God richly bless you for everything you're doing for his kingdom amen blessed be the name of the [Applause] Lord I believe that will be it for the announcement let's go to the scripture Wednesday was uh special anointing amen yes Amen brother khma is on his 25th wedding anniversary wonderful amen amen so somebody must take care of that missing spot because we got to preach amen I told him I say we're sure going to miss you yeah amen but I believe he should be he's probably streaming if I'm not mistaken or he's going to stream later if you there you can say amen I read these three scripture on Wednesday and could not even touch to any of them so we have to go back again and try to see if we can get it Genesis 14 Verse 18 if you there you can say amen amen hallelujah and mized you know who he is right you don't know how many knows who melchisedek is okay and melchisedek king of Salem you might be seated melkisedek is a king melchisedek is a king king of Salem what does he mean melc king of Salem brought forth Bread and Wine and he was the the priest of the most high God this King brought forth Bread and Wine and we understand that he was a priest and he brought Bread and Wine because the way you can recognize God you need to recognize God according to his characteristics amen amen because God sometime hide or God uh imorph amen he can change form but if you know how he operate you can detect whether it's God or not amen amen so it's very important okay king of Salem brought forth Bread and Wine and he was the priest of the most high God so it looks like God have a priest so it's like God and a priest that's what you think but it's not the case and and he bless him and say Blessed Be Abraham of the most high God like the two different person possessor of Heaven and Earth and blessed be the most high God which has delivered your enemy into your hand and he Abraham gave him T of all so the first person that PID T not to a human being to this man called melkisedek is abrah amen am blessed be the name of the Lord let's go to Psalm 110 brother cellb do we have those new one yeah that's these are the two I can see here Psalm 110 if you there you can say Amen verse four if you look at P pages are still turning if you look at Psalm 110 rather at the beginning the Bible say a Psalm of who so who got the revelation of this who enter into the temple and ate the showbread amen who built a tabernacle when God told him that he was not qualified to build the temple who changed the order of the Tabernacle what is wrong with this boy what is wrong with this boy amen amen this one is gone probably yeah amen so Psalm of David verse four the Lord has Sor and will not repent there is no changing to this amen you you who is you so somebody's there and David is watching this and God s to that person and say you so it looks like there is a God and there is a person and God is telling that person you just like brother Benjamin is here and I say you everybody clear you who you are a priest I thought we already have a priest but this is another person that they're talking about being a priest you are a priest Forever After the order of melchisedec so according to Psalm 110 there is another person there that David is giving a prophecy that that person is a priest after the order of melkisedek we explain to you on Wednesday that it means what in the likeness everybody clear in the likeness or like or in the similitude of meis EDC everybody here so if you look at this person he look like melis EDC is he okay if you check him his behavior his stuff everything he's doing look exactly like melkisedek so is melchisedec higher than this man or this man is equal to melkisedek or this man is separate than melchisedek so how many priests do we have in heaven let's go to Revelation chapter one in Genesis it's easy it's melkisedek we know him but in Psalm we have have an X it's an unknown person we don't know him everybody clear they just say you are a priest who who is that person that is a priest that will look like melkis EDC amen that will follow the trace of mesc after the DNA of M amen re 1 verse 5 let's go to verse 6 because we read this a lot and he and has made us Kings and Priests to God his father to him be glory and Dominion forever and ever amen now John is showing that we also God the Lord Jesus Christ when he came he made as priest and King and we already know that that promised to be priest was given to the Jews and he moved from the Jews all the way to the Gentile amen blessed be the name of the Lord let's go to Revelation 5 remember when God deal with the Jews he's dealing with one nation only right right which is the nation of Israel so everything is given to One Nation A peculiar Nation A peculiar country only the Jew he's the god of Israel he didn't say he was the god of Egypt everybody care so the priesthood of Moses was applied to Israel amen Revelation 5 let's go to verse uh8 and when he had taken the book The Four Beast and the four and 20 Elders fell down before the lamb having every one of them Harps we understand that now and golden vow full of ERS which are the prayers of Saint and they sung a new song saying you are worthy to take the book that's why the taking of the book is a problem and to open the seals thereof very important for you were slain and have redeemers to God so if they redeem you they're bringing you back to your original position if they redeeming you back to Gastonia means you were living in Gastonia make sense am so if they redeem you back to God means you were in God you just came out of God so they have to take you and pull you back again where you come from amen amen so something happened that you left de everybody before you get to heaven in the literal you must get to heaven in the spiritual amen did it make sense you cannot enter Heaven just like that you must be restored first in the spiritual then you can be restored in the natural everybody care so they bringing back to you to God in other words you must first become [Music] God then you can leave where God is amen that's what the word say for you were slain and has redeemers to God by your blood remember the two blood out of every what why every Kindred because this religion belong to the Jews everybody here so through Christ the borders of salvation are open is he okay he goes everywhere everybody everybody here because the levitical priesthood only was for Israel amen your blood out of every Kindred and tongue and people and Nation so everybody now can be Redeemed by God not only the Jewish people verse 10 and has made us so not only are we redeemed from every tongue every Kindred Every Nation now we are not only redeemed but we are made Kings and what and have made us to our god Kings and Priests and we shall reign on the earth Millennium that's that's why the seven SE usher in the Millennium that's why brother Bram says that everybody clear now let's pray you keep your Bible open in Revelation 4 Heavenly Father Lord we are approaching you humbly again this morning Father thanking you for everything you have been doing for us father this is another opportunity that you have gred unto us to be able to come to your house and to serve you in the beauty of Holiness father if there is anything that we have done that could be a hindrance to this service may you forgive us may you forgive your children for every time they have wasted instead of being consecrated and preparing themselves for the service father may you move everything that is not like you away from this place every fear of sickness every virus every covid whatever it is Father may you move it completely away away from this place and may the Holy Spirit Come and minister to your children father be the Alpha and the Omega of this service and speak to our soul in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen God richly bless you we are dealing with part four and we still handling the priesthood everybody clear we spoke about the five Dwelling Place of God Amen we talked about God going into the Tabernacle of Moses then into the Temple of Solomon then into the Temple of Christ and then into the temple that is called the brde which is a many member Temple but in between the Tabernacle of David uh the Tabernacle of Moses and the Temple of Solomon we saw that David built also a tabernacle which was called The Tabernacle of David amen now we found on Wednesday that there is three aspect that goes with a temple or a Dwelling Place number one the first aspect that goes with it is you must have a priest yes am or if I can call it a priesthood everybody clear number two you must have a sacrifice everybody clear and number three there is a service or a Ministry that goes with it amen now when we are refocusing ourself into The Mystery of the lever here what I want you to notice is if you recall the lever was placed between the Bren Altar and the door of the Tabernacle I want you to keep your seat belt amen amen yeah so so the lever was placed between the Bren Altar and then the uh door of the temple and if you notice here this entrance of the Temple have five pillars do you see that let me help somebody if you look at the entrance of the temple here we have a first pillar a second one a third a fourth and a fifth so when Moses was building the Tabernacle if you look at the Tabernacle from the entrance if you coming straight into the Tabernacle there was something that they call the door of the Tabernacle everybody clear but when you come to the Tabernacle right here God told Moses he said Take Five Pillars and put them right here do you follow me amen so Moses took and put one pillar right here everybody clear amen then he put the second pillar here then he put the third pillar here then he put the fourth pillar here then he put the fifth pillar here everybody care amen if if you take one 2 3 4 five it gives you five pillars everybody clear that's what you saw there amen then God say take a curtain and put a curtain over there that's why I told you to keep your seat belt everybody here so these five pillars here divided the entrance of the tabernacle into four entrance are we okay amen we if you remove the pillars you can enter into the Tabernacle straight without any problem so but when God told Moses he said put those five pillars here now the entrance you can enter here everybody care you can enter here you can enter here you can enter here everybody here now the entrance of the Tabernacle is no longer one but he becomes four everybody clear so you have a combination of five and four don't worry my friend we'll be okay amen everybody here so when we pull right here the mystery of the lever right here there is no way that you can separate the lever with the priesthood everybody here that's why we were being Express I mean explaining the priesthood from Aaron all the way as we're going to get into melc everybody clear because the lever itself when he was created or when he was manufactured or made he was for the priest amen everybody clear so the lever is always associated with a priesthood amen everybody here amen and when he was made at first the L was made for the service of the priest amen everybody clear check so when the the priests are going to minister unto the Lord Lord or when the priest are going to do service unto the Lord everybody here they have to use the lever for their service amen everybody here but later on further we found out that the L was not only for the service of the priest but the L was also for the washing of the sacrifice so we got the three element the service of the ministry connected to the lever we got the sacrifice connected to the ever now we missing the priest itself everybody clear Amen in Exodus 40 we found out that God told Moses and thou shall anoint the L and his foot and stify it and that shall bring Aaron and his son unto the door of the Tabernacle of the congregation and wash them with water so the lever help the priest thems in their Ministry the lever help the washing of the sacrifice and the lever also was for the washing of the priest one time in order to introduce them for their Ministry amen so all these three aspects that we spoke about on Wednesday were connected to the L amen everybody clear so far amen let's go to to Revelation chapter 4 hallelujah amen verse one the Bible say after this I look and behold a what so John saw a door open how did that door look like thank be to the name of the Lord amen a door was open in heaven and the first voice which I heard was as he were a trumpet talking to me which say come up here and I will show you things which must be Hereafter so a door open John need to enter Heaven and immediately I was in the spirit this is how he entered and behold a throne so when he got there the first thing that John saw was a throne you follow me is a throne that's number one he found a throne and I saw a throne was set in heaven and one sat on the throne somebody was there and he that sat was to look upon like Jasper and sish stone and there was a rainbow round about the throne in sight like an emerald this is deep teaching here but let me stay on the highway and round about The Throne were four and 24 and 20 seat and upon the seat I saw for 4 and 20 Elders sitting clothed in the white Remnant everybody C Hallelujah and they had on their head crown of crown of gold verse five and out of the throne proceeding lightning and thundering and voices it's a throne of judgment and there were seven lamps of fire burning before the so according to John before the throne here we got seven lamps here that are burning yes everybody following me the Candlestick seven lamps that are burning over there before the throne which are the water which are the seven spirit of God the seven spirit of God everybody care and we know that God is one and everybody here and Paul said that by how many Spirit by one Spirit are you baptized into the water so there is only one Holy Ghost but brother Bram explained now to us because we need a prophet that he was one Holy Ghost but manifested into seven different way throughout the seven Church ages remember our camera is in heaven everybody here if if you notice in heaven here we don't have curtains is everybody okay there is no Veil you follow me blessed be the name of the Lord verse six and Before the Throne there was a sea of glass like to Crystal amen and in the midst of the throne and round about The Throne where four beasts full of eyes before and behind so we know now that before this seven Candlestick we have the sea of glass which Moses represented as a lever everybody clear but in between the throne and the Seven Candlestick we got four living creature everybody clear and we know the four living creature are what they are the Carib beims and they are what they are the for anointing maybe we need to go back to this that went through the church edges everybody here brother Bram help me a little bit on these four brother Bram says this in the message Revelation chapter 4 he said now remember God's guard of the Ark because when they made the Ark of the Covenant Moses put the carabin on top of them everybody clear because between the Carib beam was something that was called The Mercy Seat where God was going and sit there so The Mercy Seat represented the Throne of God then the caribbe him and so forth everybody here so when brother Bram say God's god of the ark or The Mercy Seat he say to how many John S how many four because one look like the lion one look like an ox one look like uh a man and another one look like a flying eagle how many did he see he seen four four living creature they both John and Moses both seen the same vision everybody clear when Moses went to heaven he saw the Carib beams when he came down he represented them upon the Ark of the Covenant and John went in heaven and saw the Carib beams and John say there are four of them and brother brandham say and four is the number of what four is a number of the earth so when we talk about four it's connected to the Earth amen if we have four living creature so those four living creature are connected to what I hope you okay okay blessed be the name of the Lord and four is the number of the earth did you know that how many knows now before we have to go into it four is a Earthly number sure like the four is not here give somebody the microphone everybody we have four Hebrews it's the Earth it's the number of the Earth the number of what so four is not only a number of the Earth but it is a number of Deliverance so when you have number four it means somebody on the earth need Deliverance everybody here there is somebody on the planet Earth that must be delivered amen everybody clear brother brandham continue he says now keep that in your mind Deliverance because I'm going to strick it just a minute real hard Deliverance now there was three Hebrew children in the fiery furnace but the fourth one come he was what Lazarus was in the grave three days but when the fourth one comes he was what so four is the number of what so when God begin to use number four it is an anointing that have to bring Deliverance to his children everybody here so four is God's number number of what and he showed that these beings these F creature must have been something about the so now in Heaven There is no curtain right here and the light that is coming from the throne is first shining on the four living creature are we okay I mean heaven I'm not on the earth in heaven God is sitting on the throne and God is sending his light do you follow me and that light first struck the four living creatures do you follow me and then when he struck the four living creature that light is transferred into the seven Candlestick am are we okay and when it transfer into the seven Candlestick then the seven Candlestick transfer the light to the sea of glass everybody here so the light that is tracking the water here is a light that is coming from the Candlestick and the light of the Candlestick is coming from the four Beast and the light of the four Beast is coming from the throne everybody here so we found out that number one is going into number four and number four is going into to number seven and then he struck the sea what are these seven spirit of God blessed be the name of the Lord in the message the S this church ages brother brandham say seven spirit and Seven Stars the spirits was the angels that went to the stars with which were the what so in heaven we find that there is seven Spirit everybody here but on the earth we have seven Messengers do you follow me do you follow me so when it's time to use the first messenger of Paul the first Angel here in heaven Hallelujah leave the Candlestick amen do you follow me and he goes straight to Paul hallelujah hallelujah do you follow me and when he goes to Paul he find Paul holding the Bible [Music] amen let me go slowly we okay Paul was taught in all the teaching of the Hebrew Paul knew the Old Testament left and right Paul was trained under the feet of gon Paul had the confidence of the high priest and Paul with the Bible of his time when he was using the Bible he used that Bible and begin to persecute the Christian do you follow me do you follow me but when God released the pillar of fire everybody everybody and special Angel left yes sir Heaven yes sir and went straight to Paul and when that angel went to Paul do you follow me what does the angel do Hallelujah the spirit was the angels that went to the Stars which were messenger seven Spirit seven different times the holy spirit will do what anoint a what which was a star in his what so when the angel come from Heaven he goes to Paul and he anoint Paul when he's anointing Paul the anointing his anointing Paul is a light yes sir amen do you follow me you follow me and that light have to shine on the word that Paul have do you follow me because the light have to shine on the sea of glass Paul had the sea of glass but he was persecuting the Christian with it Paul needed a light from the angel to shine on his sea of light and when the light shine on the Bible then Paul changed his way of preaching Hallelujah do you follow me do you follow me Paul heard the Bible he was persecuting Christian but Paul God never changed the Bible God used the same Bible but just brought an anointing on the Bible and the Bible become a new are you there are you there because Paul said the K but it's the spirit that give what you need the spirit to shine on the light then the light become a living [Applause] word there was a pool in Israel and special pool and that pool has water just like the L you can go and jump on that water nothing will happen and everybody understood that something must take place in the water somebody must change the water so that the water can provide healing and the one who was traveling the water was an angel so as long as the have not trou the water yet nothing is going to happen to that water but once the angel travel the water whoever got into the water no matter what kind of sickness they have whether it's cancer whether it's high blood pressure whether it's tuberculosis whatever you suffer there is no limitation to sickness you get healed instantaneously because the angel have trouble the world [Music] you don't need the only you need the water that has been trou by the angel hallu Amen brother bam say a spirit is eternal and the star that was made for a purpose to do what to reflect light in dark of these churches where candles and star are represented the angel come out the spirit was the one that went to the star and reflect the light of the what of the Holy Spirit through this star to that church age everybody here it is seven messenger of seven Church ages now and each time that the star come in on the scene the Holy Spirit Come come down and anoint that star and keep it just exactly like the first one was everybody clear so far so the light Started From The Throne from the throne he goes to the four living creature for the fourth living creature he goes to the Candlestick and from the Candlestick in heaven he struck the sea of glass so you can have the bab but that bab can kill you you need the anointing from the angel to illuminate the Bible to bring light to the scripture and then the scripture become alive to you and once the scripture are alive there is life to that scripture everybody K so far everybody K so far so if you go now down into the Earth amen we found that Moses when he made made the Tabernacle in the Earth on the earth Moses put curtains that's right everybody here in heaven there was no curtain the light was going straight straight straight straight straight stuck the sea of glass but when Moses put now the light on the earth we found out that there is a curtain now we know that in the Tabernacle of Moses Everybody follow me the Tabernacle was divided in three places you know that this was the holy of holiest everybody here this was the Holy place which was called The Sanctuary everybody in here Moses put the Candlestick everybody care the Ark of the Covenant which was which had the throne was right here everybody and on top of it was the mercy seat and the two Carib everybody this one was the outer Court it was open to the sun everybody here now when you come here this was called the door of the Tabernacle amen everybody here now when they say the door of the Tabernacle that door is not this door right here go to Exodus 26 25 miles again did I lose anybody did I lose anyone okay got a chew meat you need protein amen am Exodus 26 if you dare you can say Amen go to verse 36 everybody clear amen amen let's go to 35 to help you you there and you shall set the table outside the veil this was the inside Veil we're going to get into this later Moses is tell God is telling Moses this there is a veil here everybody care that's the inner Veil and God say outside the veil here you put the table off the showbread everybody here verse 35 and you shall set the table outside the veil and the what the Candlestick were there and the Candlestick opposite the table on the side of the Tabernacle toward the South and you shall put the table on the North side my God hallelujah everybody here watch verse 36 and you shall make a what a hanging or a veil everybody you shall make a hanging for the what the door of what the door of the tent is not this kind of door did you get it the door was a curtain it was a veil it was a hanging so when they were closing the Tabernacle they were not closing closing the Tabernacle with this kind of door they were closing the Tabernacle with a curtain everybody here so that curtain have to be lift up then you enter the Tabernacle and that curtain was called the door of the Tabernacle we okay now let's go back again to verse 36 and you shall make a hanging or a screen or a veil for the door of the tent so the door of the tent was a veil everybody of blue we're going to get to this land down the road and purple and Scarlet and find Twan lenon RO with needle work we're going to get to this amen verse 37 and you shall make for the hanging for the curtain how many pillars I already showed you here everybody clear now Five Pillars everybody you shall make five pillars of shittim wood and overlay them with gold and the hook shall be of God and you shall cast five socket of brass for them so when we turn into the Tabernacle right here on the earth the lever is put on the outside everybody here and brother Bram say that the light of the Candlestick have to strike the lever do you follow me so that you can come and take take a bath in that light in the world that has been reflected by the light but when Moses made the Tabernacle in between the Candlestick not on Heaven on Heaven There is no curtain the light is traveling straight but on the earth the Candlestick light is blocked by a veil everybody here and that Veil do you follow me that Veil hanging into five pillars with four entrance am amen everybody okay everybody okay keep your seat Bel before I let you to go okay everybody here so before this light strick the lever you must lift up the veil you follow me as long as the veil is there the light will never Strike the lever and this Veil here was called the door of the Tabernacle everybody care and we found out that John also before he entered into heaven there was also a door everybody here and we know that everything in the Tabernacle represent who and Jesus said I am the everybody K everybody k i Am the door to the Sheepfold brother Bram say in orent they were not putting the door the door was a person so when you bring your sheep you put them into the fold and the shepherd himself was sleeping on the door so before you get in the ship fold you must first go through the shepherd everybody so as long as they light as long long as the door is still here the light will never Strike again the water that's why Jesus said it is good for me to go hallelujah hallelujah do you follow me as long as I am here I am blocking the light everybody here because the law came by Moses but Grace came by who our pillars have to come by Jesus Christ the pillars were holding the hanging of the veil showing that the door was the one connected to Grace Grace came by Jesus Christ who was the door but as long as Jesus Christ is there the seven Church ches cannot stop so when Christ is taken off when the veil is lift up when Christ go goes into the Rapture then the seven churches begin to shine their light into the water did I lose somebody did I lose somebody did I lose somebody as long as the veil the door Jesus Christ is here all D is connected to him he is the Fountain of the Living Water but we have building in the seven Church ages amen we have seven I mean we have seven Church ages that must start but for them to start Christ The Veil have to be lift upbody when the Val is lift up then the holy place is open then Grace is now open is open to the seven Church ages but that Grace goes to for those because there is for anointing everybody the Candlestick was behind the behind the column so when they lift up the veil do you follow me the light that was hidden have to go only through four doors did you follow me did you follow me the light that was hidden the light of the seven golden Candlestick the light the seven Golden cand Stick were here they have light these seven golden Candlestick light must grow only through four doors only through four car [Applause] bams so the first three messenger went to the first door Paul arus and Columba used the anointing of the lion they use the first door and then Columba used the second door and then Luther and Wesley luse the third door and the Flying Eagle is using the fourth one bringing grace to the Gentile Church ages because it's a number of Deliverance to the is everybody okay is everybody on board is everybody okay God is using the seven spirit amen through the seven Church ages but there is four anointing that work with them and giving grace to the Gentile Five Pillars holding the grace of God and exposing the light that's the light that struck the L that's the water that you need to take a bath with you must go in the word that is reflecting Grace under the anointing of your time that is the message that's going to prepare you wash you dress you and put you into the presence of the king Hallelujah any other water will kill you hallelujah hallelujah is everybody okay blessed be the name of the Lord did I lose anybody God say anoint the L that's why they have to put an anointing on the lever because that was on a physical to symbolize the Holy Ghost because in the heaven the Seven Angels were the anointing so mes must give you a symbol am everybody anoint the in his foot and sanctify it and that shall bring Aaron and his son unto the door of the Tabernacle you understand it now why the door of the Tabernacle because once they lift up the veil then the light is begin to shine over there everybody here remember the angel the light have to shine in a water for you to get healing that's why the Bible say I send my word and my word did what thank you Lord everybody and that shall bring Aaron and his son unto the door of the Tabernacle of the congregation and do what and wash them with water yes and that shall put upon Aaron holy garment amen and anoint him and sanctify him we're going to get to those garment that they may he may minist unto me in the priest's office and thou shall bring his son and clothe them with what the high priest have holy garment but the children of the high priest have coats okay thou shall anoint them as that did anoint their father the anointing is the same it's just the Garment that is different but the high priest is only one for their anointing shall be surely an everlasting priesthood throughout their generation now who's going to anoint the high priest who will wash the high priest and who will wash his children notice that the children of the high priest cannot be washed before the high priest everybody here the first to be washed must be the high priest first once the high priest is washed clothed anointed then every child of the high priest can go through the same process but to anoint the high priest of the first Covenant we need it a higher caliber Prophet am Hallelujah so the Lev of the Old Testament have to be coup with a prophet so when the high priest is coming there must be water and a prophet do you follow me the high priest word and a prophet am amen let's investigate that Prophet a little bit blessed be the name of the Lord the Bible says in number 26 verse 58 that these are the families of the lat the family of the liite the family of the heite the family of the malite the family of the mushat the family of the kti all of those are live God hides in genealogy everybody care and K begat amam we okay now if you sleeping wake up and the name of aram's wife was Sister yed everybody the daughter of L so right here yed is a l amam is a l so two Levi got married and have children what are their children the daughter of Levi whom her mother bear to Levi in Egypt and she bear unto them am unto am Aaron the high priest Moses the prophet and Miriam the sister of prophetes so the prophet that anointed the high priest was a levite everybody his mother a levite his father a levite 100% levite and amam took him yed his father sister to wife and she bear him Aaron and who Moes so we understand here that Moses was a levite purely 100% Lev from a family of Lev father Lev mother Lev that's the prophet that God used to introduce the high priest of the first Covenant everybody clear so far in 1 Chronicle verse 20 uh chapter 23:3 there son of amram Aaron and Moses and Aaron was separated that he should sanctify the most holy place a for Holy for Holy things and his son forever they took them for the priesthood to burn ense before the Lord to minister unto him and to bless in his name forever now concerning Moses the man of God his son were name after of the tribe of Levi all of them l in Psalm 99 ver6 the Bible says Moses and Aaron among his what So Not only was this Prophet that anointed that have to uh to watch the first high priest Not only was he a levite Moses Moses was a levite everybody here and Moses was also a priest and Moses was also a prophet a prophet L priest to wash the high priest so not everybody can wash the high priest everybody clear so far blessed be the name of the Lord the Bible says in Num chapter 12 here he said if there be a prophet among you I the Lord will make myself known unto him in a vision and I will speak unto him in a dream my servant Moses is not so who is faithful in all man house with him will I speak how even apparently and not in dark speeches in other word when God talk to Moses he doesn't use code yes sir he talked to Moses straight and the similitud of the Lord shall he what so Moses had the right to see God hallu hallelujah everybody the Bible said nobody have seen God in any time only the only begotten have decare him but Moses had the right to enter and to put his eyes on God and nothing happened to Moses that's the prophet that can anoint the high priest everybody here and when God discuss with Moses they don't talk symbols plan amen amen hallelujah I will raise them up a prophet from among the Breen like unto who God is telling Moses I'm going to send a big Prophet but that Prophet will be like you hallelujah amen hallelujah Deuteronomy 34:10 and there arose not a prophet since in Israel like unto who whom the Lord knew how Moses and God were body everybody Hallelujah Moses was a levite Moses was a major prophet Moses was a priest and Moses caliber was so high until God gave him a permission to see him Hallelujah everybody and he's Ministry was so big until he was given the authority to introduce the law because the Bible say the law came by Moses everybody and he built a tabernacle for God everybody care and usually when a Old Testament sent died because they were under the blood of BU God do you follow me they were going down to hell you remember that but at that time hell was divided in two places there was a place that was the place of those that were saved and the other place was the place of those that were lost then you go down to the region of the demon and you go down to where Lucifer is sitting himself everybody so you can do anything to Lucifer he's waiting for you when your ministry is finished everybody finish everybody okay you can cast out Devils you can heal the sick you can do all kind of problem Lucifer will back up because he knows God give you the right he's waiting for the appointment everybody care once the heaven call hell and say his ministry is over the devil say that's say I got it Angel of Death where

Abraham look at you he said don't pay attention to him he's not going to do anything keep coming keep coming keep coming he said don't worry about the Devil he's not going to do anything keep coming

god Abraham say don't worry about it you know I will redeem him you not Redeemer he's coming job said don't worry my redeemer will come don't worry about the devil but in the case of Moses he was

seven lamps there on and seven pipes to the seven lamps which were upon the top thereof everybody verse three and what and what only few people and what two Olive Tree by it one upon the right side of the ball and the other upon the what left side of the ball we know the seven Church ages but we don't know these two Olive [Music] Tree jum to verse 11 jum to verse 11 then answer that and say to him what are these what two olive trees upon the right side of the Candlestick and upon the left side thereof what are they what does he mean we already know the kandles stick now I can break it down I can preach it what about these two olive trees jump to verse 13 everybody and he answered me and say know you not what this be and I said no my Lord verse 14 then said he these are the what how many two anointed one that stand by the lord of the whole So In Heaven There is two anointed one that have the right to see God [Applause] hallah sir that's why he said my servant Moses can look at me that's why when Moses die they pick him up that's the prophet that introduced the first high priest hallu everybody C so who are these olive trees go to Revelation 11 two olive trees two what anointed let's go to Revelation 11 blessed be the name of the Lord do you love the message Hallelujah hallu spiritual food in due season Revelation 11 are you there verse three and I will give power to my two what Witnesses over there two olive trees two anointed over here two witness brother Stephen they say two olive trees no problem everybody here I will give power to my two witnesses and they shall prophesy 1,23 score days cloth in s cloth these are the two what [Music] the two olive trees and the two [Applause] [Music] what can I continue and the two and the stick standing before who the god of the [Music] water brother Steven two olive trees okay two olive trees they are witnesses they are anointed what are they what are their name you going to tell me the name okay I know what brother Bram say brother Bram say is Moses and Elijah we want to see it in the scripture everybody here verse five and if any man will hurt them what happen fire fire Pro Pro seed out of their mouth and devour their what enies who in the Old Testament spoke and fire came and burned somebody what is his name okay come on and if any man hurt them he must in this manner be killed so we found one characteristic of Elijah brother stepen anybody could do that slow down let's narrow our our choices verse six these have power to shut Heaven that he re not in the days of the what who did that in the Old [Music] Testament everybody clear so far did Brother Steven say something okay thank you and have power of a water to turn them into what blood who turn water into blood the Old Testament everybody clear young people we okay now and then continue and to Smite the Earth with all what as often as there who was giving the plague in the Old Testament so who are the two olive trees and what and if Moses introduced the first levitical priesthood who's going to introduce the second [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] one everybody here everybody here everybody clear my God blessed be the name of the Lord hallelujah now we found out that the the the levitical priesthood is introduced by a great prophet an anointed one on the right hand or left hand of God that's why when the son of zebede the the the M ask Jesus we want to be on the right side and the left side he say that one must be predestinated who thought those who Tau that mother that In Heaven There is a right side and a head side so Moses a levite Moses a priest Moses a prophet brought a great Covenant the law and introduce that law according to Hebrews 7: 19 the Bible said the law made nothing perfect oh brother stepen nothing so the law is worthless how can the law such a great command that have to be introduced by such a high caliber Prophet make nothing perfect is the LW worthless in Romans 7 verse2 the Bible said the law is Holy and the Commandment holy and just and what you need it was then that which is good made death unto me Paul is asking you say it's good it's holy so how are we in the cha he say God forbid don't think like that but sin that IM appear what working death in Me by that which is what so the law sin was hidden in us that's correct do you follow me you follow me amen so when God want to shoot sin he's going to shoot you but God doesn't want to destroy you he's looking for sin and when he want to catch sin sin's hide on you do you follow me then God say don't worry I know what to do then God put the law do you follow me let me explain it again so he help you up do you follow me there is a glass and inside the glass there is a snake I need the glass but I don't want the snake if I'm caught up so much into the snake which the Lord did I will end up shooting the glass everybody here if they preaching he so up to the devil do you follow me they keep pointing sin all the time young people young people young people young people young people you will end up shooting and you're going to destroy the young people do you follow me he's just a glass he's anointed by something we need to find a way to get the snake out so we can recuperate the glass and shoot the snake do you hear me you hear me because that was the ministry of condemnation all the time banging on the people head you follow me so either you get caught up with the snake and you shoot they say what does the snake want what has the snake like he love to eat bird no problem they took a bird and they place it there outside the cup with a snake when the snake saw the bird the snake begin to forget about the glass he begin to pull his head off and show his color following the the bird not knowing that God is taking the glass off do you follow me once God take the glass off then the seed of the woman will crush the head of [Applause] the because the seed of the woman is coming but for him to crush the the promise in the Garden of Eden they said that the seed of the woman will crush the head of the serpent so the serpent must be out completely so when the seed come he can crush him do you follow me that's why Paul says that the law is good so what the law did the law brought the bird in other word the Lord did something to you to help sin bring its head upbody because when there is no law there's nothing amen do you follow me if a young child is born he can walk with diaper there's nothing to him because there's no law but if you tell him walking with diaper is a problem the law is activated then you're going to see the snake that was inside coming up now when he sees you he's watching you mom is there then he put the pain if Mom is not there because so that behavior was not before because he was unconscious of the law you follow me he become the law bring you consciousness of sin so sin take occasion and say oh they told you don't do this they thought you don't do this so now let me make you do that go ahead and do it go ahead and do it and the devil didn't understand that he was now pulling them one by one everybody and Moses take a pen and say what is that one stealing keep pulling keep squeeze them again uhhuh and another the demon squeeze them and the LA begin to take note let's continue he say but sin that he may appear what working death in me but that which is what that sin by the Commandment might become exceedingly what you see what I'm saying so by the Commandment the devil has been squeezed so much until he show up his color he said I hate you okay now we see who we dealing with because at the beginning God bless you God bless you she's a scent woman push her and pull the snake out that's why God put you in trouble to pull the snake out Hallelujah are you there and when something happened to you you get mad then the Holy Spirit say you see what you're still struggling with there is still a snake inside are you there then you take that snake you say God one was hidden this one kill him that's why Paul say I Die daily are you there when he pull a demon we slay him when he and the most slaying is going the more you are changing so your temptation is not what you're thinking are you there it is building a character [Music] hallelujah amen until when they shake you you don't move anymore then you are really dead Hallelujah they say that the Lord made nothing perfect but bringing in off a bed and what by the which we draw what so we could not Draw N to God in the old Tabernacle nobody enter there only the high priest if you enter there God kill you but what are we going to do we need something better that can put us in the presence of God because Isaiah was a prophet he went into heaven what happened block he found himself he was Heaven Sin they took Joshua the high priest in heaven filthy garment when every Old Testament died they can't go to heaven they have to go to paradise because something is blocking we need something better but the law was just telling them I'm giving you this temporarily let me pull the black dog out completely then I will handle him down the road everybody so far the Bible said the law having a shadow of what so it was a hope a shadow of good things to come and not the very image of things Moses only duplicated it but the true Tabernacle have to come down the high priest here was a representation of the high priest there so this one is only a representation but the true high priest have to come can never with those sacrifice which they offer year by year continually make the camer there on to what Hallelujah the Bible says this but before Faith came we were kept under the law shut up unto the faith which should afterward be revealed wherefore the law was our he was teaching you sin correct everybody the Lord was pointing you what sin is this is sin this is sin now you become aware of sin that's right he was our school Master to bring us onto what so the law was not bad he was just teaching you to bring you to Christ amen hallelujah one day there was a woman that was cheating on her husband that's right she keep doing that nobody catches her she sneak out on Facebook talk to the man nothing happened she come to church she act like she sent when you talk to her God bless you Sister I love my husband honey when the husband goes to work she sneak out God say no that's a daughter of Abraham I need to handle her so what do I do put the law everybody God permit an occasion for her to be caught and to be caught without discussion in other word with proof we have her tape we recorded her we did everything everybody Undisputed right there she say I'm done because the Lord say when they catch you like this is only one thing what do we do kill you

snake out of soul and waited until David is gone then the snake comes back again then they have to call David again where is my time Hallelujah the Lord was a school Master to bring us unto Christ that we might be justified by faith but after that faith is come we are now no longer under the school Master then you switch gear for ye are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus for as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ there is neither Jew nor there is neither born nor free there is neither male nor female for ye are all one in Christ Jesus so Paul now is talking not to the Jews only now he's including everybody everybody here Moses was this is for the Jew everybody clear watch what's going on my God blessed be the name of the Lord the Bible says in Matthew 10:5 these 12 Jesus sent forth and commanded them saying go not into the way of the I still have time this kind of sermon you go like in eternity and when you come out you say wo we still okay you were somewhere in eternity everybody the first group you mention here is the Gentile everybody and into the city of the Samaritan everybody clear Samaritan but go right to the lost sheep of the House of what Israel so we got three groups here we got the Jews we got the Gentile and we got the Samaritan everybody so when Jesus Christ came he was restricted to the Jews only and he told his disciple don't go outside because the Covenant of Moses we got to stay inside everybody here everybody here but go rather to the lordship of the House of Israel now in John 1 verse1 the Bible say he came unto his own the Jews and his own receive him what so when he entered the door because Moses said the Lord your God will send the prophet like unto me so the Jews were expecting Jesus and when Jesus came the Jews rejected him everybody by rejection of the Jews another door open everybody everybody now the promise that was given to Israel to be a kingdom of priest everybody clear that promise now is leaving the Jews and it's going outside amen amen hallelujah you following me you following me amen what happened the Bible says that in John chapter 4 he must need go through what remember there was only the Jews now the door open Jesus goes to the Samaritan anybody care amen these three groups and then he came to the city to a city of Samaria which is called sasher near the parcel of the ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph going down to the conversation Our Father Worship in this mountain and he say that in Jerusalem is the place where a man ought to worship because that's where the Salvation were supposed to come the Messiah Jesus say unto her woman believe me the hour cometh when you shall nether in this mountain Samaria nor yet in Jerusalem God chosen place of worship where the temple was worship the father ye worship you know not in other words you are ignorant you are just worshiping you don't understand amen we know what we worship for salvation is of the Jew that's where the place God chose amen verse 39 and many of the Samaritan of that City believed on him for the saying of the woman which testify she didn't preach she testify because this is what denominational uses he told me all that I ever did and when so when the Samaritan were come unto him they besought him for that he would ter with them and he there two days and many more believe because of his own word so we found out here there were people that believed Jesus in Israel there were people that believed Jesus in The Samaritan because the Samaritan were half Jews have Genta but there's a problem with the Gentile right amen because according to Revelation five out of every every tongue every God is going to make priest now God can make priest the Jews he can make Priest The Samaritan but there's still another fold that is not Incorporated everybody CLE I hope that is connected can you touch it again my brother the devil is wasting his time amen uhoh go back again um scroll up Scroll up again no go to [Music] 25 scroll up let me help you out yeah 25 go ahead right here look at this right here uh-huh okay let's see what is coming up wasting time devil praise be the name of the Lord you might have to sit right there everybody clear let me scroll up quick because we already here right there all right we already went here we did this we did this ah that's right there in John chapter 10 verse 16 Jesus say and other sheep I have which are not of this fold everybody care which are not sure if so them also are must bring and they shall hear my voice and they shall be and so the ministry of Jesus Christ is to take the Jews the Gentile the Samaritan and gather everybody into one family with one Shepherd that's why he told them I have had a sheep that are outside they are not of this fold of the Jews I must bring them up so everybody might be onefold everybody here remember we have the Gentile the Samaritan and the Jews in Acts chapter one brother Kelly verse 8 the Bible say but ye shall receive power Jesus is dead he's resurrected now he's sending his disciple he say you shall receive power after the Holy Ghost is come upon you and ye shall be Witnesses unto me both in what Jews and in what Jews and in what Samaritan and unto the the door is open everybody here the door is now open that's why Jesus say in Matthew 28 he said go ye therefore and do what you see now not only the Jews because MC Incorporated God Amen everybody everybody here all Nation teaching them Mark 16:15 and he says unto them go ye into what and do what to not only the Jews everybody here Luke 24 and that repentance and remission of sin should be preached in his name among Nation beginning at everybody clear now the levitical priesthood was only restricted to the Jews but we need to go beyond the Jews we need to go and get all the children of God from everywhere they are and bring that's why we need a different priesthood that can incorporate everybody everybody C so far that priesthood in Genesis 14 we see a priest called meis EDC in Psalm 10 we see an unknown person called a priest like MC so to get more clarification on meis EDC let's go to Hebrews seven with Paul you okay now I have to stop somewhere okay give me time and I search for the airport for this madc king of Salem we saw that already priest of the most high God who met who why did meis EDC have to meet Abraham why Abraham why not somebody else Hallelujah Romans say that the law worketh R for where no law is there is no transgression therefore it is of faith that he might be by the Five Pillars to the end the promise might be sure to all yes sir if it's by law it is only the Jews yes but but we want everybody that is the seed of God to be recipient of the promise everybody not that only which is of the law the Jews but that which is also of the faith of who who is the father of as what that's why Paradise was the bosom of Abraham even though Adam was before Abraham did you hear me did me Abraham came later but the paradise took his name everybody Abraham who is the father of us all as it is written ah have made thee a father of what so Abraham was never the father of Israel only now it make sense usually when we say Abraham they Jew say our father Abraham God never told Abraham One Nation he said you are father of many Nation the Jews took them like it is Abraham our father but that was not the case so meis going to Every Nation must meet the father of every nation Hallelujah are we okay oh my God Amen the Bible say know ye therefore that they which are of what the same are the children of what so the children of Abraham are not the Jews certain Jews might be children of Abraham Hallelujah because Jesus Tau the Jew that if Abraham was your father you would not have SE to kill me you are of your father day everybody and the scripture everybody okay foreing that God the scripture understood that God would justify the the Gentile through what preach before the gospel to who saying inde Abraham shall what be what bless hallelujah amen if God would have put everything to the Jews we locked God put it on Abraham because Abraham was not Israel Israel came after Jacob and Abraham was not even circumcised Abraham was a ad [Music] worshiper he has no God Hallelujah so then they which be of Faith are blessed with the faithful what now Abraham and he Seed where the promise is made he said not to seeds as of what but as of what and that seed which is who that's why M came to him because this Covenant I can not I cannot deal that with the Jew I have to deal that with somebody who's not Jew Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah the Bible says Abraham returning from the slaughter of the king and bless him to whom also Abraham gave a 10th part of all first being by inter interpretation what so MC means what so when you dealing with melis EDC the first interpretation is king of what king of righteousness first yeah so when meis comes then first thing that come up is righteousness everybody care king of righteousness and after that also king of what which is what so MC have two things in him he have righteousness and he has peace are we okay MC is Jehovah [Music] Chen the Lord my righteousness mix with Jehovah Shalom the Lord my peace everybody so you have the righteousness of God which is mixed with the peace of God that's why uh David say righteousness and peace have done what kiss each other it's in the PSAL everybody because the righteousness of God something produces wrath the righteousness of God sometime produces punishment everybody care everybody care the punishment but that punishment of Peace but Robert you got it can you say loud yes the chastisement of Peace was [Applause] upon who is this meis EDC hallelujah king of peace without without father without descent having neither beginning of days no ending of what if you if you follow Meed in the genealogies you won't find him so if the priest that will come will be like melis EDC if you go to the genealogy you cannot find that Prince [Music] either somebody have not CAU it yet but just hang on now notice his St king of righteousness prise god king of righteousness and king of Peace he is Hebrews 7 King of righteousness king of Peace he is two kings there now since he has come in the flesh and receive his body up Revelation 21:16 he is called the king of what amen Revelation what 2116 take Revelation 21:16 I'm going to go to the airport hallu you heard it hallu is traffic in the airport take Revelation 2116 brother Bram say Revelation 21:16 he's called what king of King let's go to Revelation 21:16 you're going to learn something all the young people make sure you read this young people read this brother Bram say Revelation what 21:16 let's read Revelation 21:16 and they see theise what and the length of it is larger as the breath and he measured the city with the read 12,000 ft long the length and the breath the height as it is equal do you see any king of King there you see now brother bam you see brother Steven what is the key brother Bram is saying you're going to find in that scripture what king of what the key is is King of Kings I search in Revelation 21 I don't see that you see this message have many stuff that are wrong because that's what I was looking for in the message I was looking for an error one thing error then I can justify my living that's right but look how a Seed of Abraham check the message I want you to all learn this brother Bram said 2116 I don't see it but brother Bram gave the key that he's talking about is king of King it is revelation 2116 go to Revelation 1916 amen are we okay are we okay is everybody there I want all the young people to see that let's see Revelation 1916 and he has on his vure and on this tie a name written what so what helped me find Revelation 16 I was not critical to the prophet because I was not critical to the prophet I'm trying to catch the logos I'm trying to catch the mind of God what is he talking about he's talking about king of King when you go you find it's a narrow of number but this the message is Right king of King is in the Scripture it is perfect that's why I say the message is perfectly in line with the that concept never misses the scripture do you hear me young people what am I trying to say there brother Bram I said the Empire he has to have an Empire I meant a there is a saying and a meaning you need this to follow this Prophet everybody I am like they say about the Dutchmen you know I don't don't take me for what I say but for what I that's the message of the hour I said I think they understand me all these years this is 30 years I've been behind this Pulpit here 30 years in this Tabernacle you ought to be knowing me by this time shouldn't you oh my my is what how can this make you leave the message because you wanted to leave the [Music] message because you wanted to leave the message everybody everybody so you learn young people what the prophet is trying to convey so see is receiveing the flesh he's what king of King he is all three of them together King God King toopan King Jesus he is the king of King it's all made just like what everybody here hold on I'm going to drop King what what is the first king king God according to John 4:21 God is a and those that worship Him must worship Him in what God is a the second one king theophany toopan was born from God everybody everybody let me leave it there before I get there king T the thirdd one is who Jesus King Jesus the man Jesus is the and this one should be what do you see why brother Bram say that Soul which is the te everybody so King theop King Jesus he is King of Kings it's all meant like body soul soul body and spirit all come together to make what watch now carefully he's the Father which is the first the Son and the Holy Ghost the spirit king of righteousness the spirit attribute everybody here theophany king of Peace theophany In the Flesh he was king of King brother br says MC is king of righteousness and he's king of Peace butam say king of righteousness is the attribute of the spirit and king of peace or Salem is the attribute theophany everybody in other word MC was the spirit of God do you follow me that Veil himself in a theophyl do you follow me do you follow me God was a spirit God imorph himself into a light and that light was the pillar of fire everybody here so when the pillar of fire came out of God the spirit of God enter into the pillar of fire and the pillar of Fire God was one everybody and that word was made flesh me and my father are one so you got the three combined together hallu hang on I'm going to the airport mcedc Paul say who also has made us able to ministers of this new testament brother Michael note of the letter but of the righteousness for the letter by the spirit giveth life but if the ministration of death the law written and engraved in stone was glorious so that the children of Israel could not steadfastly behold the face of who for the glory of his countenance which Glory he was to be done away how shall not the ministration of the meis EDC be rather glor for if the ministration of condemnation the Lord be glory how much more do the ministration of what king of what amen am are we okay you got to review this at home everybody everybody one day the he Brew was in the fire the Bible says he answer and say lo I see before men lose walking in the midst of the fire and they have and they have no hurt and the form of the fourth one is like the what so they saw somebody walking like a human being yes but that person they call him the Son of God amen amen amen I'm going to get MC down as we go on with this lesson of melis EDC this melkisedek this great priest of Salem and the possessor of Heaven and Earth now being first with our father with our mother with descent having neither beginning of days nor ending of life but was made like unto the Son of God a b preached continually now watch he was not the Son of God the man Jesus he was the god of the son everybody okay relax now keep your back seat because I'm going to hit the airport he was not the Son of God melis EDC was not but he was the father of the Son of [Music] God everybody okay no so far in John 58 therefore the Jews sought the more to kill him because he not only had broken the Sabbath but he said that God was his what making himself equal with who did I lose anybody who is this meis EDC everybody clear God the priest is melkisedek can you kill God who's going to help us then the priest of Heaven Is God he's melis EDC he's the father of Jesus Christ but we need the priest that can take care of us so we can enter in the presence of God Amen when we teste MEC MC can disappear go tell MEC I have a headache he doesn't understand headache amen M cannot understand Heaven amen because melis EDC doesn't eat he can't get hungry amen but we saw somebody who fasted 40 days and he got hungry so when I say I'm hungry he remember when he fasted let me head to the airport God could not suffer in the spirit he had to become to feel the pain of sickness to feel the temptation of last to feel the temptation of want to feel the temptation of hunger to feel the power of death that he might take it upon himself to stand in the presence of the great spirit Jehovah the spirit not the man the spirit to make intercession to this life and Jesus took that in order to make intercession for us for he knows how he feels when you get sick he knows how you feel when you are tempted he knows how you feel amen hallelujah God coming down to become man to die could not die as a spirit because he could not die he is eternal and he could not die but God could make himself in such a way that he could feel pain and he could feel and suffer God could not suffer as the eternal spirit but when he become man he could suffer feel the pain and the Temptation that man went through like Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden and everyone ceas everybody clear that's all he asked just leave it there he is our high priest standing here that knows how you feel and he knows how to reconcile you back to Grace how to bring you back to your health he knows all about it he suffered when you have not got a place to lay your head he had the same when you got one change of clothes he had the same when you are made fun of it persecuted he has the same so God needed a body that he can live like you and me because the first high priest was human the second one must be human how is he going to be human Hebrew 10 when he cometh into the word he says sacrifice and offering that W is not but a body has that prepare me that's why they great eternal spirit who imorph himself in the pillar of fire later on IM morph himself and get into a man and that man was called the Lord Jesus Christ which is Emmanuel God With as now we find somebody that come down and he's God but this God can have a headache Hallelujah this God can get tired Hallelujah this God can cry this God can feel hunger if you beat him he hurt [Music] him amen am he is Emmanuel we found out on Wednesday that he was the temple of God but if the temple comes with a high priest we must take that high priest and wash him who's going to wash him Moses already was Aon Moses was a priest a levite a major prophet one of the anointing on the right hand somebody else must come and that person must be a levite a son of the levite himself a priest himself a prophet and he himself must be one of the anointing because we have to watch the high priest before he start his ministry the high priest must be amen let's stand why are you going through all of this you need to understand that there is somebody who took care of your problem amen there's somebody who took care of your problem if Israel could stand in their places there and be under anxiety because the high priest is gone and every year their their blood pressure have to go up in Yumer in the day of atonement because if the atonement is not received they in trouble their high blood pressure was up they have to wait wait for the priest to enter and the priest to finish and come and say this year it's over so for the rest of the year they are they are covered and then next year they got to wait for the another high priest to go in there but we don't have to do that for all once for all if Israel could sleep in peace because a human high priest under the law that could not make anything perfect could bring peace and safety and calm to Israel when their sin were not even remitted what can the New Covenant do to us so if a Jew look at you being trouble with all of this his mind is puzzled because you got the real deal yes yes sir he got the substitute the law the Shadow and Israel was strong with the shadow until today they still climing under the shadow which was only a hope of better things how much more the real thing let's pray Heavenly Father Lord we approaching you again humbly this morning thankfully Lord father thanking you for the New and Living Way that you have opened through US

Lord if there is anybody sick in this place Lord or somebody that have a specific need that they brought in coming to church Lord father you know exactly what they are looking for and you are the solution Lord father to their problem if before the atonement Lord father a water in the pool of beesa could solve any kind of sickness any kind of infirmities they didn't even need the doctor
