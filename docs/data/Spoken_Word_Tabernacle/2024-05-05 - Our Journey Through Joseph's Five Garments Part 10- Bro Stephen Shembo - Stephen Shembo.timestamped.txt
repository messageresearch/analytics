[42:17] a big clap
[42:18] [Applause]
[42:25] off you might be see it a little bit now
[42:29] you see how the enemy has been
[42:31] fighting left and
[42:33] right but by God's grace everything is
[42:36] doing well everybody knows what an iron
[42:40] D
[42:41] is iron dum do you know what it
[42:46] is you don't know what it
[42:51] is it's a n defense
[42:54] system that Israel has yes it's an air
[42:58] defense system that they put on Israel
[43:01] so if you shoot a missile or an RPG or
[43:06] you shoot a weap or you send something
[43:08] to Israel the iron dumb is 24 hours
[43:13] working that whatever comes in it will
[43:16] block it and destroy it before he hit
[43:19] the
[43:21] people amen so whatever you shoot the
[43:24] aod is always working anyway will be
[43:27] activate if you send something from Iran
[43:30] or you send something from Lebanon or
[43:32] you send something from Gaza or for
[43:34] Yemen you sent whatever you send toward
[43:36] Israel even when you sleeping there is
[43:39] an iron n that is sitting there as soon
[43:42] as it's coming it destroyed in the air
[43:45] before he hit the
[43:48] ground now you understand why AR have to
[43:51] send 300
[43:53] John at the same time that's right and
[43:56] they sended from different direction sir
[43:58] some are coming from the south some are
[44:00] coming from the North and the purpose is
[44:03] to
[44:05] overwhelm the defense
[44:08] system so that in other word when you
[44:11] shoot 100 all they want is at least two
[44:15] to pass through and to cause damage but
[44:19] by God's grace they intercept all of
[44:21] them and I put them down
[44:24] [Applause]
[44:28] and that is exactly what the enemy is
[44:30] doing
[44:32] now he's attacking from this side
[44:36] attacking from this side attacking from
[44:38] that side attacking to overwhelm you but
[44:42] there is a God that doesn't sleep amen
[44:44] he doesn't Slumber amen he's 24 hours
[44:48] watching over you and there is a
[44:50] protection better than the iron down it
[44:53] is called the blood of Jesus Christ so
[44:56] no matter what is coming against church
[44:59] he will not Prosper amen no matter what
[45:01] is coming against you nothing will
[45:04] prosper no weapon form against you am
[45:07] will prosper there is a defense system
[45:10] that is protecting you amen be a good
[45:13] cheer my friend am all things are
[45:15] working together for
[45:18] good amen amen he thought he's going to

[50:03] apologize we are fighting with the
[50:07] devil so everything was working fine
[50:11] until this morning so it's
[50:16] sat so let's put the blame
[50:21] there let's go to Genesis 39
[50:24] again so you know what we still working
[50:28] with Genesis
[50:32] 39 verse 1 if you there you can say amen
[50:39] amen glory to God everybody can hear me
[50:43] okay amen Genesis 39 verse1 the Bible
[50:48] says and Joseph was brought down to
[50:52] Egypt and pipar an officer of pharaoh so
[50:56] we still dealing with this captain of
[50:59] the Guard an Egyptian bought him of the
[51:03] hands of the Israelite which had brought
[51:06] him down there you might be seated so we
[51:10] are in the House of pipar a military man
[51:14] we know what he means now it takes
[51:17] military to decode Authority and once
[51:20] you understand Authority you can also
[51:22] decode the third pool amen amen
[51:26] verse two and the Lord was with Joseph
[51:31] amen this statement we didn't see it
[51:34] before in the life of Joseph all we knew
[51:38] it was Joseph saw
[51:40] dreams and then according to the dream
[51:42] Joseph had a
[51:44] position and that was interpreted even
[51:46] by his brother one of them say that do
[51:49] you want to re over us or have dominion
[51:52] over us so Joseph already was
[51:55] predestinated that's right by God for a
[51:58] high
[52:00] position am amen amen he was
[52:04] predestinated to Reign yes and to have
[52:08] dominion because in both dreams people
[52:12] are bowing down to him amen amen amen
[52:16] they are bowing down or they making
[52:18] obedience to him so he was positioned he
[52:20] was already predestinated to rain but
[52:23] now in the house of Piper something else
[52:27] unfolded in the life of Joseph if you go
[52:30] back to Genesis 37 there is nowhere
[52:33] where he say the Lord was with him right
[52:35] right right but we know the Lord was
[52:36] with him because he was a prophet and
[52:38] the lord gave him Vision which were
[52:40] dreams that were interpreted but here
[52:43] it's clearly stated that the Lord was
[52:46] with him when they put him in the pit
[52:49] God was there amen when they pull him up
[52:51] they took him to Egypt God was there but
[52:54] here it's more obvious uhhuh yes wow
[52:57] somebody can look and say there is
[52:59] something different about this Bo it
[53:02] happened not in the land of Canaan it
[53:05] happened in the house of part under a
[53:08] mentor that's where it happened amen
[53:11] amen amen under a master or under a
[53:15] mentor which Paul explained to us that
[53:18] it's a
[53:20] tutor or a governor you remember
[53:24] that verse two the the Bible says and
[53:27] the Lord was with
[53:29] Joseph and he was a prosperous man there
[53:34] is two things here one of them when we
[53:37] looking at Joseph the Bible say the
[53:40] first one the Lord was with
[53:43] him that makes a big difference
[53:46] amen amen amen and the second one he was
[53:50] a prosperous
[53:51] man where was this Prosperity coming
[53:55] from amen amen amen because we didn't
[53:58] see that in the land of
[54:00] Canaan it only happened in the house of
[54:05] Piper over there it's just a story of
[54:09] hatred between the brothers and
[54:10] everything but clearly here Joseph God
[54:13] is with him God is with you in your
[54:18] life and also he's a prosperous man amen
[54:22] how can a prosperous man find himself in
[54:24] such a situation
[54:28] amen amen how would you know that you a
[54:32] prosperous man come on
[54:34] now amen they got to put you in
[54:39] trouble then Prosperity will be
[54:42] manifested how will we know that you
[54:45] have the ability to fix
[54:47] something something have to break amen
[54:50] and when you start fixing it then we
[54:51] begin to understand amen that you got a
[54:54] gift in your life amen
[54:58] so whenever something happen sometime
[55:01] it's only also an opportunity to display
[55:04] what was hidden in you
[55:06] amen are we together are we together the
[55:10] Bible says in verse two and the Lord was
[55:13] with Joseph and he was a prosperous man
[55:17] and he was in the house of his master
[55:20] the Christian no the Egyptian so God is
[55:24] using a setting that is not even a
[55:26] Christian environment Amen to prepare
[55:29] you for his
[55:30] task is my Bible different than yours no
[55:33] sir God is using an Egyptian not a
[55:37] Hebrew an Egyptian to prepare you for
[55:41] that amen amen verse three and his
[55:45] master
[55:47] saw that the Lord was with
[55:51] him there is two things here Joseph the
[55:54] Lord is with him number one
[55:57] number two he's a prosperous man and his
[56:00] master decod the first one so by Joseph
[56:04] being in his house he saw something
[56:07] different about this boy than any other
[56:10] person in the house right and he
[56:13] understood that not Joseph has some kind
[56:15] of magic magic or he's a magician or
[56:19] something but he brought him to a an
[56:23] acknowledgment that this boy have a God
[56:26] that is following him a god that is with
[56:29] him somebody saw deity
[56:33] Amen in the life of somebody
[56:36] am am amen amen when he was with his
[56:40] brother they didn't see
[56:42] deity that's right
[56:45] amen when he was with all his brother no
[56:48] deity because jealousy blind the people
[56:51] amen when somebody's jealous they don't
[56:54] even see what is normal amen
[56:56] [Applause]
[56:59] you can show them you say this is what
[57:01] brother Benjamin is wearing a suit they
[57:03] don't see a suit they will say no it's
[57:05] just a clo because it's
[57:10] jealousy amen amen amen glory to God
[57:14] verse three and his master saw that the
[57:17] Lord was with
[57:18] him and that the Lord made all that he
[57:24] did to do what prosper in his hand so
[57:27] his Prosperity was coming from God amen
[57:31] amen so in the house of postier God is
[57:34] with him uhuh amen amen and God is
[57:37] making everything that he's doing
[57:39] prosperous and py decoded both of them
[57:43] amen amen amen amen amen amen amen so
[57:48] when Joseph was in Canaan none of this
[57:53] was displayed right that's right amen
[57:56] that's exactly right all he knew is his
[57:59] dream dream yeah I see people bowing
[58:02] down to me I'm going to be probably a
[58:04] big man or I'm going to occupy a great
[58:07] position what is that position we don't
[58:09] know
[58:11] amen because most of the time we want to
[58:13] know what is our position that's right
[58:16] that's correct brother I know that I'm
[58:18] going to be somewhere but what is my
[58:20] position where am I going to be that
[58:22] somebody is he in the house of Piper is
[58:25] he in Egypt here is he in Canaan is he
[58:29] uh somewhere where am I going where is
[58:32] my position where is my destination amen
[58:36] where am I going amen and how do I know
[58:39] that I'm going to the right direction
[58:41] amen amen amen everybody okay amen his
[58:48] prosperity and the presence of God in
[58:52] his life amen begin to make
[58:57] way toward his
[59:01] destination let me start it again the
[59:04] presence of
[59:07] God amen amen amen and how God Prosper
[59:12] what he's doing
[59:16] yes amen amen our two key element
[59:21] pushing Joseph toward the right path
[59:25] amen
[59:30] watch the next verse verse four and
[59:34] Joseph found Grace in his sight and he
[59:37] served him and made him how overseer
[59:41] over what his house did Joseph require a
[59:46] position did he apply for it
[59:49] no no no no no was he praying for it
[59:54] what open that position
[59:57] position
[59:59] God the presence of God uhhuh and how
[1:00:04] God the work of God in the life of
[1:00:07] Joseph amen those work were prospering
[1:00:10] amen and those work open the door for
[1:00:14] him toward a highest position in other
[1:00:17] word wherever you put
[1:00:21] Joseph how many have already taken maybe
[1:00:25] if you take a back of water and you have
[1:00:28] uh a lead maybe uh from a bottle and you
[1:00:31] take that lead and you push it down to
[1:00:33] the bottle of the bucket of
[1:00:37] water when you take whatever your hand
[1:00:40] or your road or whatever when you take
[1:00:43] it off what happened to the lead comes
[1:00:45] back
[1:00:48] up you heard it you you heard it in
[1:00:52] other word if you take Joseph you put
[1:00:55] him down

[1:25:31] from the Bible the mysterious part amen
[1:25:35] Joseph revealed the mysterious part amen
[1:25:38] that can never be seen only by God Amen
[1:25:41] in other words you have a crop that only
[1:25:44] Joseph can pull it out amen but if I
[1:25:47] have crop that n none of those crop will
[1:25:49] happen until Joseph come amen when
[1:25:52] Joseph come another weth of is for that
[1:25:57] for never knew before amen when brother
[1:26:00] Bram comes and mystery of the Bible
[1:26:03] comes out that nobody knew only brother
[1:26:09] BR Genesis 41 verse 25 if you dare you
[1:26:13] can say amen amen the Bible say and
[1:26:16] Joseph said to Pharaoh the dream you
[1:26:19] know the dream of pharaoh is one God has
[1:26:23] showed to pharaoh what he's about to do
[1:26:26] so the thing is coming from God jum to
[1:26:29] verse 29 behold there come what seven
[1:26:32] years of plenty throughout what all the
[1:26:35] land of Egypt and there shall arise
[1:26:37] after them what seven years of famine so
[1:26:40] seven and seven is
[1:26:46] zeroall there is seven years of plenty
[1:26:49] and they will there was seven years of
[1:26:53] Plus are we okay amen are we together
[1:26:56] amen and there will come seven years of
[1:26:58] manness so both of them will do what
[1:27:01] zero cancel
[1:27:06] out is is the MTH
[1:27:09] difficult amen amen amen amen
[1:27:14] amen where are you heading glory to God
[1:27:18] hallelujah amen amen verse 30 and there
[1:27:21] this Bible you will always read it and
[1:27:23] something keep popping up popping up
[1:27:26] popping up that's the message of the
[1:27:27] hour amen amen because if he goes to
[1:27:31] zero this is
[1:27:35] trouble it's a trouble we will run out
[1:27:41] hungry because the seven year are meant
[1:27:44] to cancel and to destroy the other seven
[1:27:47] years whatever was created must be
[1:27:50] destroyed and we will go to zero and
[1:27:53] everybody stop
[1:27:55] so you need Joseph
[1:27:58] amen amen amen if I lost you raise your
[1:28:03] hand sir thank you my friend back there
[1:28:07] there is seven years of plenty and there
[1:28:10] are seven years of
[1:28:13] famine let's read about that famine so
[1:28:15] you get the point well verse 30 and they
[1:28:19] shall arise after them what seven years
[1:28:21] of famine and all the Plenty shall be
[1:28:24] how forgotten in the land of Egypt and
[1:28:27] the famine shall consume how the land
[1:28:30] and the planty shall not be known in the
[1:28:33] land by reason of what that famine
[1:28:36] following for it shall be how very
[1:28:39] Grievous in other words the power of the
[1:28:42] negative seven is too strong than the
[1:28:45] positive
[1:28:48] seven are we together so when the femine
[1:28:51] is coming it is pretty bad until the
[1:28:54] seven kind or the seven Cales ate all
[1:28:58] the other one and the Bible said they
[1:29:00] were still ill will in looking so it do
[1:29:05] you know that it's in the Bible the
[1:29:07] seven cow ate the fat one but they never
[1:29:10] grew
[1:29:11] fat look at the Bible the Bible say when
[1:29:14] they finished eating the other one they
[1:29:16] were still looking fin
[1:29:19] skinny in other word whatever can be
[1:29:22] produced in a year it's not
[1:29:26] enough to withstand the negative year so
[1:29:30] now you need Joseph amen because Joseph
[1:29:34] if you give him seven
[1:29:38] uhhuh are we together if you give Joseph
[1:29:41] seven Joseph won't return seven no sir
[1:29:45] he will bring some mysterious amen that
[1:29:48] will be more abundant than seven Amen in
[1:29:52] order to withstand the fine amen because
[1:29:55] if you keep seven and seven it's going
[1:29:56] to be zero the people will be starving
[1:30:00] you need a Ministry that can produce
[1:30:03] food amen beyond what has been given
[1:30:08] amen amen store the food amen store the
[1:30:12] food amen store the food amen store the
[1:30:15] food amen not for the congregation that
[1:30:18] was in
[1:30:19] Jeffersonville God when you storing food
[1:30:22] you storing for the future amen not for
[1:30:25] the present so brother was not storing
[1:30:28] food for those that were there because
[1:30:30] most of them are already theread amen
[1:30:32] but the food was store for the future
[1:30:35] amen God knew I'm going to see mik daily
[1:30:38] amen I'm going to see John I'm going to
[1:30:41] see Greg I'm going to see brother so I
[1:30:44] need to keep some food for brother
[1:30:49] Micha back amen
[1:30:52] [Applause]
[1:31:00] I am
[1:31:01] sorry but I'm responsible for what I say
[1:31:05] a message Church cannot preach the Bible
[1:31:08] just
[1:31:12] [Applause]
[1:31:15] normal when you go through a true
[1:31:17] Message Church it looks like every day

[1:31:23] amen something new amen something
[1:31:26] mysterious amen that you never seen am

[1:31:32] Hallelujah of the anointing of Joseph
[1:31:36] amen the anointing of Christ Hallelujah
[1:31:40] so when people are going to church they

[1:31:44] anticipation what is God going to say
[1:31:46] today again when he comes to say praise
[1:31:49] the Lord I read this all this time I
[1:31:53] never seen
[1:31:54] before but when the anointing of Joseph
[1:31:57] come he pulled the mysterious part am
[1:32:01] and the B become a
[1:32:09] [Applause]
[1:32:11] new I am responsible for what I say but
[1:32:15] truth need to be declared amen a message
[1:32:18] church is different than
[1:32:20] denomination even when we repeating
[1:32:22] brother Bram we not parot no sir we are
[1:32:26] repeating the message with an anointing
[1:32:32] [Applause]

[1:33:09] his message or just play tape and leave
[1:33:11] it alone but that's not
[1:33:13] it when we look at the message we look
[1:33:16] at the Bible the Bible open up because
[1:33:18] Joseph has more
[1:33:21] [Applause]
[1:33:23] you give him the message of William Mar
[1:33:25] Bram you begin to see things begin to
[1:33:27] come out amen because Joseph have more
[1:33:30] in other word every day you go to a
[1:33:32] message church is different
[1:33:36] amen
[1:33:40] amen ah my brother I'm doing this I'm
[1:33:43] saying this in the Lord I am not
[1:33:46] boasting anything in Christ but truth
[1:33:49] have to be declared amen am we don't see
[1:33:52] there like denomination where we go we
[1:33:54] do our religion and
[1:33:56] go you must come out and say God did for
[1:33:59] me something different today I learned
[1:34:01] something different today I see God in a
[1:34:05] different way I used to read this quot
[1:34:08] but I never understood it today now I
[1:34:11] understand this better than
[1:34:16] before we read the cot we didn't listen
[1:34:18] to it we didn't understand that but now
[1:34:21] God gave me the revelation of what
[1:34:23] brother was really talking about amen
[1:34:30] amen we are still reading the scripture
[1:34:34] where are we at verse 31 and the Plenty
[1:34:36] shall be forgoten by the land by um not
[1:34:41] be known in all in the land by reason of
[1:34:44] the famine following for it shall be how
[1:34:46] very Grievous for and for that the dream
[1:34:50] was how doubled unto Pharaoh twice it is
[1:34:53] because the thing is how established by
[1:34:55] God by Satan no sir by who by God if God
[1:35:00] established that who have the solution
[1:35:01] to that only God Amen and God will
[1:35:06] shortly do what bring it to pass now
[1:35:08] therefore after interpreting the dream
[1:35:10] he's giving even the solution amen
[1:35:14] without requesting for
[1:35:17] position
[1:35:18] okay he didn't say it's Pharaoh now that
[1:35:22] I have interpreted the
[1:35:24] what position will you give me now
[1:35:27] because he was more interested about
[1:35:29] being free so that he can go back to his
[1:35:32] father that's why he told the batt when
[1:35:35] you go there please I was taken away
[1:35:37] from Hebrew all he want was to be free
[1:35:39] and go back there so probably he would
[1:35:41] have stopped and say I gave you the
[1:35:43] interpretation my friend can you just
[1:35:45] free me so I can go back home that's
[1:35:48] right hallu God was looking at something
[1:35:52] else amen and he he cannot go home he
[1:35:54] need to stay where he ish it is home
[1:35:57] that's going to reach him amen home will
[1:36:00] reach you amen you not

[1:36:13] and your family are still in one you're
[1:36:15] not coming down they're the one that's
[1:36:17] going to with you amen amen you stay in
[1:36:21] your position amen Your Position will
[1:36:23] pull your children uhhuh and pull them
[1:36:26] up where you are
[1:36:28] Amen in other word you keep claming with
[1:36:32] God don't worry about your family member
[1:36:35] your family member will finally
[1:36:38] eventually God will send some famine and
[1:36:42] that famine will bring them closer to

[1:37:28] it can you say amen amen he say he
[1:37:31] usually run away from

[1:37:38] searching for him because he was
[1:37:40] predestinated for it amen hallelujah in
[1:37:44] other word the position is pulling you

[1:38:51] this year you will find you take a fief
[1:38:54] a fief is
[1:38:56] 20% amen amen if 7 years is meant to
[1:39:00] destroy 7 years what is 20% of s years
[1:39:05] due to 7
[1:39:08] years I'm going again clearly amenallah

[1:39:58] very
[1:40:04] bad the god that we serve amen is a god
[1:40:09] of paradox amen when Gideon Army you

[1:41:45] scene in our way of thinking if it's 700
[1:41:50] to get this what do we do we need to get

[2:00:07] garment one after one even when Israel
[2:00:10] went to Egypt when they first got into
[2:00:13] Egypt they were given the land of Goan
[2:00:16] right Israel was the top Elite in Egypt
[2:00:20] they were the most privileged people
[2:00:23] because of Joseph but brother Bram say
[2:00:26] and the Bible say they rose up a
[2:00:29] pharaoh that did not know Joseph amen
[2:00:32] and that Pharaoh flipped the
[2:00:35] Garment because they were prospering he
[2:00:38] flipped the Garment from a High people
[2:00:41] and put them onto slaver Israel in Egypt
[2:00:44] become slaver then God came and sent
[2:00:47] Moses and Moses took them up toward the
[2:00:50] promised land amen but before they got
[2:00:52] there God put them through the
[2:00:54] Wilderness and they chose the
[2:00:57] law and the law put you in
[2:01:03] prison brother BR say the law is what
[2:01:05] put you in prison so you can see this
[2:01:08] garment all the way through in the life
[2:01:10] of Jesus Christ you will see them and if
[2:01:12] the Lord allow it you will see it in the
[2:01:14] life of
[2:01:16] David so all of our life we have this
[2:01:19] garment that has been displayed there
[2:01:22] that we're moving with them amen amen
[2:01:24] now we are dealing with the house of
[2:01:26] Piper and we found out that Piper is a
[2:01:30] military man py by being a military man
[2:01:33] it's a home where we got
[2:01:35] discipline a home where you under
[2:01:39] Authority you must be submitting to
[2:01:41] Authority amen because without that you
[2:01:44] cannot be prepared for the throne
[2:01:46] everybody okay so in this home here
[2:01:50] according to Paul
[2:01:52] in in galatian chapter 4 we found out
[2:01:56] that an amen when he's a child he's
[2:01:59] immature he's not different than a slave
[2:02:03] or a servant but he is still the Lord of
[2:02:06] all yes but he have to go under training
[2:02:10] through Tudor and Governor until the
[2:02:13] appointed time in other words God has an
[2:02:15] appointed time for your training before
[2:02:18] you can handle your position amen
[2:02:21] everybody clear and the end of this
[2:02:23] training brother Bram say is
[2:02:26] adoption that's why brother Bram
[2:02:28] preached several message he him Amen
[2:02:31] brother Bram used the scripture to show
[2:02:33] that after training through the tutor
[2:02:36] through the governor the end of it
[2:02:38] you're going to be adopted you're going
[2:02:39] to be placed into your position and that
[2:02:43] adoption when we saw last Sunday
[2:02:45] requires discipline amen because brother
[2:02:48] Bram say but how can the church there
[2:02:51] were what the Pentecostal church and the
[2:02:53] what the Methodist and Baptist Church
[2:02:55] and the Baptist Church be how adopted
[2:02:58] until they come to what disciplin
[2:03:00] without discipline no adoption we got to
[2:03:03] be what disciplined first God could not
[2:03:06] trust this power with John and
[2:03:11] James because they were ready to
[2:03:13] barbecue the
[2:03:16] people they were ready to rust them with
[2:03:19] fire god was not ready to give them the
[2:03:22] sir amen we say that adoption goes with
[2:03:29] discipline Oh Glory to God if you can
[2:03:33] allow me to erase this amen amen
[2:03:36] adoption according to brother Bram
[2:03:39] adoption goes with discipline it's hand
[2:03:42] in hand thank you amen and not only that
[2:03:47] brother Bram says this he said God could
[2:03:50] not trust the power this power with the
[2:03:52] church it is hard to tell what you will
[2:03:56] do if God would have granted James and
[2:03:59] John what they wanted they would have
[2:04:01] killed the entire city and brother Bram
[2:04:04] says this again reminding you that now
[2:04:07] placing the son first thing after the
[2:04:10] son was in he become what a son but then
[2:04:14] we found out that his what behavior is
[2:04:17] what set him to what adoption whether he
[2:04:19] behaved right or what or not so adoption
[2:04:22] goes with your behavior amen your
[2:04:25] behavior and discipline when you master
[2:04:29] these two things then you ready to rule
[2:04:31] amen you ready to reach your position am
[2:04:34] but brother Steven what do we have again
[2:04:36] to deal with this government let's go
[2:04:39] now with me into the Book of Mark
[2:04:42] chapter
[2:04:44] one we are talking about John whose love
[2:04:48] charity and we got James whose hope
[2:04:52] both of them ask the Lord to open the
[2:04:55] third pool so they can handle those that
[2:04:59] didn't respect them or respect the Lord
[2:05:01] Jesus Christ and rejected them amen and
[2:05:04] Jesus turned around he said you don't
[2:05:06] understand the son of man Ministry the
[2:05:08] son of man Ministry when he comes it's
[2:05:11] not to destroy it is to save life amen
[2:05:15] now let's look at these
[2:05:18] disciple where are they coming from and
[2:05:21] where are
[2:05:22] heading as we dealing with this garment
[2:05:25] in Mark

[2:28:52] in a desperate State before I get here
[2:28:56] you already try everything you try

[2:29:01] came that's why I chose your boat
[2:29:04] hall
[2:29:06] Hall because you were born for
[2:29:13] something I can't preach what I was
[2:29:15] trying to preach James means what hope
[2:29:19] John means what love what does Peter
[2:29:23] means

[2:29:32] born with faith amen but he didn't
[2:29:36] know wow Peter was born with faith but
[2:29:40] suffering all
[2:29:42] night seeing nothing unable to use the

[2:29:50] [Applause]
[2:29:52] hallah do you follow me God came and
[2:29:55] said Peter give me your boat why did he
[2:29:57] choose only Peter's
[2:30:01] boat it was time to crank that engine
[2:30:05] up he say sit and listen to the sermon
[2:30:08] Faith cometh by what hearing as Jesus
[2:30:11] was preaching something prick
[2:30:14] Peter amen maybe when Jesus was saying
[2:30:17] the word Peter was like oh my God never
[2:30:21] a man spoke like this where was this man
[2:30:24] all along I never he such a message like
[2:30:27] this and when Peter was all taken up a
[2:30:31] voice came and said
[2:30:33] Peter come on now for the
[2:30:35] catch that's why Peter could no longer
[2:30:38] play game he said
[2:30:43] Master amen can I continue he says I
[2:30:48] told all
[2:30:50] say to him Master we have done what
[2:30:53] taken to or not and have taken what
[2:30:57] nothing but nevertheless at what Thy
[2:31:00] word who brought Peter to the level of
[2:31:03] catching God at his word on brother
[2:31:07] that's
[2:31:08] it at that word I will do what let down
[2:31:12] the net a
[2:31:15] professional fature learn now
[2:31:20] to
[2:31:21] Humble his ability and to expect the
[2:31:25] supernatural amen am I train you to be
[2:31:30] fishermen but I know I'm going to use
[2:31:33] that fisherman technique for something
[2:31:35] in the
[2:31:36] future amen but before I take you
[2:31:40] there let me give you some Vindication
[2:31:43] bu so you understand he says and when
[2:31:47] they have done this they enclose what a
[2:31:50] great multitude of fishes and the N did
[2:31:53] what break where did the fish come
[2:31:57] from I'm asking you the professional say
[2:32:01] all night all night did he say all night
[2:32:05] all night meaning there was there was
[2:32:08] not a portion of the night they didn't
[2:32:10] work we cover all night I search for
[2:32:14] this joyy I open the joyy I search the
[2:32:17] entire joyy we even pull the joyy we

[2:32:35] keys there who put that key
[2:32:40] there amen amen we told all night
[2:32:45] nothing but when they put so the catch
[2:32:50] the net broke too
[2:32:54] much of the net broke because what they
[2:32:58] caught was beyond the ability of the
[2:33:04] net because whatever get into the hand
[2:33:06] of
[2:33:08] Joseph he have to go
