[11:24] Lord Jesus, we thank you, Father.
[11:28] What a mighty miracle working God you
[11:30] are, Lord God.
[11:33] We're thankful, Father, for the
[11:34] fellowship that we had yesterday, Lord.
[11:36] The wonderful meal, Lord, and the
[11:38] effort, Lord, that everybody put into it
[11:40] yesterday, Lord God, is so wonderful. So
[11:43] wonderful, Lord Jesus, to spend time
[11:46] with each other, Lord God, around this
[11:48] word, Lord God, for everything, Lord,
[11:51] that you have shown us, Lord. Everything
[11:53] that you do for us, Lord God. We can't
[11:56] even express our gratitude, Lord God,
[11:59] for where you've brought us from, Lord,
[12:01] to this very moment, Lord God. Your
[12:04] mercy and your grace just exceeds
[12:07] anything that we can think, Lord God.
[12:10] We just ask Lord God as we gather once
[12:13] again Lord Jesus that you would make
[12:15] yourself known amongst us this morning
[12:17] Lord God. We feel your presence here
[12:20] Lord God. And we want to acknowledge
[12:22] that Lord
[12:24] for that's part of your goodness Lord.
[12:26] That you never forsake us and never
[12:28] leave us Lord. That you're dwelling in
[12:30] our praises Lord and our worship. We
[12:33] thank you, Father, for always showing
[12:36] up, Lord God, when we need you, Lord.
[12:39] We ask that you touch our musicians this
[12:42] morning, Lord God.
[12:44] We ask you touch our singers, Lord God.
[12:47] What a wonderful, wonderful
[12:49] atmosphere these singers create, Lord.
[12:52] Just lifting your name on high every
[12:54] Sunday and every Wednesday.
[12:56] We thank you, Father,
[12:59] and bless our technicians, Lord, for
[13:01] they want everything in order, Lord, to
[13:03] please you, Lord. They want to just
[13:06] glorify you, Lord God, in the way that
[13:09] we, Lord, just put everything together.
[13:11] And we thank you, Father.
[13:14] Give travel mercy, Lord, for those that
[13:16] may be on their way yet. Lord, bless
[13:19] this precious congregation, Lord. The
[13:21] visible and the invisible, Lord God.
[13:24] Lord, well, you know what we've all been
[13:26] through, even a lot of things together,
[13:28] Lord, as a group, and we just, Lord, it
[13:30] just bonds us closer together, the good
[13:33] and the bad things or what we consider
[13:35] bad, Lord. But even those things work
[13:38] for our good, Lord God. And we thank
[13:41] you, Father, for this precious people.
[13:45] Lord, watching their faces come up on
[13:48] that screen yesterday. Lord, it just
[13:51] it's overwhelming
[13:53] as far as love goes for each other.
[13:55] Lord, just to see happy couples
[13:58] displayed on that screen, Lord God.
[14:03] We thank you, Father. We give you all
[14:06] the glory for that, Lord.
[14:08] And Lord, we want to ask you go to that
[14:10] little front room up there, Lord. No
[14:12] doubt our pastor's tired, Lord. But we
[14:14] want to ask, Lord, that you be his
[14:16] strength this morning, Lord God, and his
[14:18] weakness as well, Lord. You are his
[14:20] strength, Lord.
[14:23] We thank you, Father.
[14:26] Let it come forth exactly like you gave
[14:28] it to him, Lord God. And just feed us
[14:30] this morning, Lord. What a wonderful
[14:33] thing, Lord, to be here, Lord Jesus.
[14:36] We thank you, Father. We love you. We
[14:39] don't have words, Lord, to express
[14:41] ourselves,
[14:43] but we just ask, Lord God, that you
[14:45] finish the work in us that you started,
[14:47] Lord God. It's too late for us to turn
[14:50] back, Lord God. We just want to ask that
[14:53] you just carry us on through, Lord. We
[14:56] all familiar with the footprints in the
[14:58] sand, Lord. There's times where there's
[15:00] only one set because you're carrying us,
[15:02] Lord.
[15:04] So as you see need Lord and above all
[15:07] let your will be done Lord God. We give
[15:10] this service to you Lord and these
[15:12] people back to you Lord God once again
[15:15] in the name of Jesus Christ for your
[15:17] glory and your honor for there's none
[15:21] other worthy to be praised in Jesus
[15:24] Christ's name. Amen and amen and amen.
[15:28] Y'all might give him a clap offering
[15:30] this morning.

[15:34] say, "We are together again this
[15:37] morning." And it is so good to see
[15:39] everyone in the house of the Lord. Amen.

[28:41] Y'all might be seated just a minute. I
[28:44] do have um I do have now actually three
[28:48] testimonies. We'll three short ones.
[28:51] Everybody's said a little a little one,
[28:54] a quick one, and a short one.
[28:56] So,
[28:58] let's have the testimonies first because
[29:00] I'm sure they're praise reports and uh
[29:03] and then we'll read these prayer
[29:05] requests and pray over them. Amen. And
[29:07] we do have some specials this morning as
[29:09] well. Amen. Brother Greg, Brother Greg
[29:12] is the one that has a little one. He's
[29:15] got a little testimony.
[29:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:20] &gt;&gt; I won't.
[29:21] &gt;&gt; I know. About to get one.
[29:24] Uh, Lord bless you all. Um,
[29:28] after that service Wednesday,
[29:31] if you got any problems after that, I
[29:34] don't know.
[29:36] Um, but, uh, Friday evening, uh, I do
[29:40] have glasses, but I I don't hardly ever
[29:42] wear them. Um, but Friday evening after
[29:46] I was finishing up a job, I was on my
[29:47] way home
[29:49] and um it was dark and I I put my
[29:53] glasses on
[29:55] and everything is blurry.
[29:59] I'm thinking, what's going on with that?
[30:01] You know, so I took them off and I could
[30:05] see.
[30:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:07] &gt;&gt; I put them back on and everything was
[30:09] blurry.
[30:11] So, I'd just claim that my eyes are
[30:13] getting better.
[30:19] &gt;&gt; Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful.
[30:22] Amen.
[30:24] &gt;&gt; Brother Tony has the quick testimony.
[30:27] Amen.
[30:29] God bless you, my brother. I try not to
[30:32] let it get longer while I'm up here.
[30:34] &gt;&gt; Um, just a quick testimony. I don't know
[30:36] if y'all remember a couple weeks ago,
[30:38] brother Self read a prayer request on
[30:41] convention night about our son. He had
[30:43] like a growth on the steroids and they
[30:46] was trying to say they want to check and
[30:47] see if it was cancerous. Um and they
[30:50] scheduled the test for like maybe two
[30:52] weeks out and um you know that's just
[30:54] enough time for the devil to work. I
[30:56] said I said why they schedule it so far
[30:58] out? I said because he want to aggravate
[30:59] you for two weeks. I I I said, "But we
[31:02] prayed. Y'all prayed and they end up
[31:04] canceling the um appointment to check in
[31:07] and it said everything was normal." So
[31:09] everything got thrown out. So thank you.
[31:15] &gt;&gt; Wonderful.
[31:17] Woo.
[31:18] Amen.
[31:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. Last but not least, the short
[31:24] testimony, right? Amen.
[31:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:28] &gt;&gt; God bless you all. I believe you're
[31:30] doing good.
[31:31] &gt;&gt; Well, the first one it might be a bit I
[31:34] guess small but to me I thought it was
[31:36] big. So at work during break like they
[31:40] have a ping pong table and I learn how
[31:41] to play ping pong over there, right? And
[31:44] there's a person there that creates his
[31:46] own pad and when he makes his pad it's
[31:50] like around $250 to $300 and he get he
[31:54] made one for me and gave it for me. He
[31:56] gave it to me for free. So to me that
[31:58] was something big. I thought that was
[31:59] pretty cool. And the second was because
[32:02] there's certain position at work and
[32:05] where it kind of put you like in
[32:06] authority doing certain things you have
[32:08] a lot of responsibility
[32:10] and they kind of pulled me there and I
[32:12] didn't know what I was doing but somehow
[32:14] everything was working and at one point
[32:17] I had told uh one of the person that
[32:18] pulled me in that position I needed to
[32:21] do something. I told him I don't think
[32:23] I'm able to do it. I don't think there's
[32:25] any way for me to make it or whatever.
[32:28] And as I was saying that, we were
[32:31] walking after that, I saw like I guess
[32:33] the answer to what I was looking for
[32:34] right there. And he told me, "Never say
[32:37] never." Then I was like, "Yeah, that
[32:38] must be God." So I want to thank the
[32:39] Lord God for it.
[32:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:48] &gt;&gt; I have another praise report handed to
[32:50] me from Sister Hadasa. She wants to
[32:52] thank the Lord for the young brothers
[32:54] and sisters here at Spoken Word. She
[32:57] said, "I appreciate all they do to help
[32:58] and they were truly a blessing yesterday
[33:00] during the meeting. May the Lord rich
[33:02] you uh richly bless you all." Amen.
[33:06] Praise God. And we feel the same way. I
[33:09] I think our children here, forgive me
[33:12] for using the word children, but uh I
[33:14] think we have a very special special
[33:17] caliber of young people here. Amen.
[33:20] Amen.
[33:21] &gt;&gt; And and we know who we know who's
[33:23] responsible. We put it all on God. Amen.
[33:26] &gt;&gt; Okay. I do have some pray some prayer
[33:28] requests. And first of all, I would like
[33:30] to um uh to mention brother Biscll's
[33:34] name. You know, he went on to the Lord.
[33:37] I think it was Thursday after many,
[33:39] many, many years. A lot of us got to see
[33:41] him in Swansea when he came down to this
[33:43] area. I think um when we saw him, I
[33:47] lifted Rebecca up with one hand there.
[33:50] They mentioned something about children
[33:51] being raised in the message and she was
[33:53] small enough then where not, you know,
[33:56] she was a baby, of course, but she's
[33:57] just like I lifted her up. I remember
[34:00] that. I'll never forget it. Amen. And um
[34:03] so we want to remember his family in
[34:04] church in prayer. I'm sure they're
[34:06] rejoicing. Amen. Because that was a very
[34:09] long life spent. You know, if you need
[34:11] to know who he is, go look up the 42
[34:14] inch caribou horns.
[34:17] Yes, brother Tony. Come on up with
[34:20] Sister Rosemary. Amen.
[34:24] Amen.
[34:29] God bless you saints.
[34:30] &gt;&gt; Um a quick testimony. This is way way
[34:33] overdue. Uh there was a time my husband
[34:36] and I we asked for God. We were both
[34:38] praying in different ways. I asked for
[34:41] God for something very very specific, a
[34:44] specific amount. and my husband asked
[34:47] for a specific date. Um this was um for
[34:52] the sale of our home cuz it had taken 3
[34:55] months desperation set in the God gave
[34:58] us our answers both of us. And I also so
[35:01] I really wanted to thank God for that.
[35:03] Um I'm also taking this opportunity to
[35:06] let you all know we are going for the
[35:08] barrier of our 15year-old grandbaby that
[35:10] passed. So we'll be traveling next week.
[35:13] We'll be away for a couple weeks. We
[35:15] desire your prayers. God bless.
[35:19] &gt;&gt; God bless. Lord be with you.
[35:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:23] Amen.
[35:25] We also have a a prayer request as well
[35:29] for a Miss Alicia. Um she will be
[35:32] undergoing treatment
[35:35] um for stage four breast cancer. I don't
[35:37] know who this is from, but we just we
[35:39] just want to hold on to Miss Alicia this
[35:42] week as um this is pretty, you know,
[35:44] this is a pretty serious request, but
[35:46] God is able. He's he's able. Amen.
[35:49] Praise God. Brother Michael, would you
[35:51] like to come up and lead us um one one
[35:54] more time before y'all take your trip
[35:56] over these prayer requests? Let's all

[1:06:16] the joy, the happiness, and the way they

[1:10:22] please for the water baptism. We will

[1:10:27] service and give us some time for the
[1:10:30] prayer. It's going to be either on a

[1:10:44] has been busy because we have meeting on
[1:10:47] on Wednesday. I preached
[1:10:52] &gt;&gt; I ended up preaching on Wednesday. I
[1:10:54] thought I was translating but I was

[1:11:10] Saturday we got the young sisters. Just
[1:11:12] wait. We're moving on. But somehow
[1:11:15] either on Tuesday or on Wednesday or on
[1:11:18] Friday, we will be taking one hour. We
[1:11:20] tell you wherever you want. Just chime
[1:11:22] in. If you can't make it, no problem.
[1:11:24] You wait for the next one, and we keep
[1:11:25] moving. So we can pray together as a
[1:11:28] church. We get on, you put your prayer
[1:11:30] request, you bring your request, and we
[1:11:32] start praying one hour, everybody, so we
[1:11:36] can uh at least ambush the devil
[1:11:38] &gt;&gt; because somebody might be out of town.
[1:11:40] They're living further away from the
[1:11:42] church. They need three hours. So, let's
[1:11:44] remove all of that. God gave us some
[1:11:46] technology
[1:11:47] &gt;&gt; where you can be three or three hours
[1:11:49] away, but we can all get in contact and
[1:11:51] we can uh pray together. Amen.
[1:11:54] &gt;&gt; Everybody okay with that?
[1:11:56] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Brother Glenn, Brother Tony,
[1:11:58] I believe I got everything covered. If I
[1:12:00] forget something, Brother Robert, you
[1:12:02] let me know. But I believe we got
[1:12:03] everything. So, let's go to our reading
[1:12:06] this morning and then get into the word.
[1:12:10] I was trying to move on. I can't move
[1:12:12] on. I need to get something in front
[1:12:15] before we get to further instruction of
[1:12:17] the season. So the Holy Spirit, I'm a
[1:12:20] pastor who have to obey.
[1:12:24] I have to obey the Holy Spirit and then
[1:12:26] do what he want me to do because it's
[1:12:28] not my church. It is his church.
[1:12:31] &gt;&gt; I'm just here as a manager, but I got a
[1:12:34] big boss.
[1:12:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. He's the one talking. Amen. So
[1:12:38] flight attendant prepare for takeoff.
[1:12:41] Let's pray. Heavenly Father,
[1:12:43] &gt;&gt; Lord, we are approaching you humbly this
[1:12:46] morning. Father, we thank you for your
[1:12:48] grace, for your love, your mercy, and
[1:12:50] for everything that you have been doing
[1:12:52] for us. Father, this is as far as I can
[1:12:55] go with the ability that you have given
[1:12:57] me. This is not a human ability. It's a
[1:13:00] Holy Ghost ability because there is
[1:13:02] nothing we can brag about it. Everything
[1:13:05] is about you and it's all about you
[1:13:07] Jesus. Father, Lord Jesus, may you come
[1:13:10] and speak to us all and bless us both
[1:13:12] visible and invisible audience. Lord,
[1:13:15] may you move everything away Lord. May
[1:13:17] you come in the power of resurrection
[1:13:19] and may you bless your children as we
[1:13:22] commit it all unto thy hand in the name
[1:13:25] of Jesus Christ. Amen.
[1:13:28] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Let's go to the book of 1
[1:13:30] Chronicle again, chapter 12. You need
[1:13:33] your Bible as we traveling this. My

[1:14:05] &gt;&gt; My theme this morning is the right
[1:14:08] focus.
[1:14:14] &gt;&gt; The right focus.
[1:14:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. in seasons
[1:14:27] because many things happen in season but
[1:14:31] you need to know where to focus.
[1:14:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:36] &gt;&gt; Because the devil won't let you just
[1:14:37] grab what is yours like that.
[1:14:41] &gt;&gt; Forget it my friend. Amen.
[1:14:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:43] &gt;&gt; So we need to get some instruction on
[1:14:45] how to focus. If you there you can say
[1:14:48] amen.
[1:14:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. 1st Chronicle 12:32.

[1:15:07] &gt;&gt; Thank God for the speaker over there.
[1:15:12] &gt;&gt; If you got a problem, I got a quote.
[1:15:16] &gt;&gt; You got a problem? H because brother
[1:15:17] Brandham saw a sister,
[1:15:20] &gt;&gt; not a brother,
[1:15:20] &gt;&gt; not a brother,
[1:15:21] &gt;&gt; a sister
[1:15:22] &gt;&gt; dancing.
[1:15:24] &gt;&gt; And brother Brham was about to was
[1:15:27] starting to criticize
[1:15:29] &gt;&gt; until the anointing hit. Brother Brham
[1:15:33] &gt;&gt; and my prophet found himself
[1:15:36] &gt;&gt; dancing with a sister.
[1:15:39] &gt;&gt; Oh, do you need the code?
[1:15:42] &gt;&gt; Do you need the code?
[1:15:44] Hey,
[1:15:45] [Applause]
[1:15:48] &gt;&gt; if it happened here, you would say,
[1:15:49] "Brother, no." The prophet of the hour,
[1:15:52] &gt;&gt; the sister was dancing and brother Moso
[1:15:55] was dancing.
[1:15:58] [Applause]
[1:16:00] [Laughter]
[1:16:04] &gt;&gt; Your your your PhD in fology.
[1:16:09] [Applause]
[1:16:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. The prophet dance under the
[1:16:14] anointing.
[1:16:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:18] &gt;&gt; If the prophet dance, who am I?
[1:16:24] &gt;&gt; One day they were worshiping the Lord
[1:16:27] &gt;&gt; and the anointing hit the system
[1:16:30] &gt;&gt; and the sister move on from the worship
[1:16:33] &gt;&gt; from the piano
[1:16:34] &gt;&gt; and God
[1:16:36] &gt;&gt; the angel of the Lord
[1:16:38] &gt;&gt; came down and begin to play the piano.
[1:16:41] Yes sir.
[1:16:46] &gt;&gt; If God is worshiping
[1:16:49] &gt;&gt; with the piano,
[1:16:52] &gt;&gt; what should I do?
[1:16:55] &gt;&gt; What should I do?
[1:16:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:59] &gt;&gt; Remove your former stuff away.
[1:17:02] &gt;&gt; Worship the Lord freely.
[1:17:04] &gt;&gt; Praise him freely.
[1:17:06] [Music]
[1:17:08] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Jesus,
[1:17:11] &gt;&gt; that's your problem. You'll be
[1:17:12] disappointed. Wait the day of the
[1:17:14] rapture.
[1:17:16] &gt;&gt; When everything is left,
[1:17:18] &gt;&gt; oh my Godship.
[1:17:22] &gt;&gt; You will understand why Miriam took the
[1:17:24] temple.
[1:17:28] &gt;&gt; Because something happened,
[1:17:35] &gt;&gt; my friend. I'm loaded.
[1:17:38] Yes, sir.
[1:17:39] &gt;&gt; I'm loaded in scripture and in quote,
[1:17:41] I'm loaded. I have them like this
[1:17:43] &gt;&gt; and I keep some of them on my phone.
[1:17:46] &gt;&gt; In case somebody attack, I just pull my
[1:17:48] phone and begin to load.
[1:17:53] &gt;&gt; We are normal people. People
[1:17:57] that laugh,
[1:17:58] &gt;&gt; people that smile,
[1:18:02] &gt;&gt; people that get upset,
[1:18:07] &gt;&gt; even Jesus got upset.
[1:18:10] Yes,
[1:18:10] &gt;&gt; he did.
[1:18:12] &gt;&gt; Release me. First Chronicle chapter 12,
[1:18:18] please. 1 Chronicle chapter 12. It was
[1:18:21] like yesterday on a married couple. I'm
[1:18:23] trying to move and this one is pulling
[1:18:25] and this one is pulling. This one is
[1:18:27] pulling. And now we ended up stopping at
[1:18:30] the surface.
[1:18:33] &gt;&gt; 1 Chronicle 12:32. If you dare, you can
[1:18:37] say amen.
[1:18:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:39] &gt;&gt; The Bible says, "And the children of
[1:18:42] Issachar," now it's clear to you.
[1:18:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:46] &gt;&gt; Which were men that had understanding of
[1:18:50] times. You might be seated. It's people
[1:18:53] that have understanding.
[1:18:57] &gt;&gt; Understanding of what?
[1:19:00] &gt;&gt; Understanding.
[1:19:05] &gt;&gt; Of times.
[1:19:07] Understanding.
[1:19:10] Understanding
[1:19:12] of time.
[1:19:14] &gt;&gt; Times plural. In other words, they
[1:19:16] understood season.
[1:19:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. They had understanding of times
[1:19:22] come to know what Israel ought to do.
[1:19:28] &gt;&gt; So that understanding gave them the
[1:19:30] ability to see the right path
[1:19:34] &gt;&gt; that they need to take
[1:19:36] &gt;&gt; the right action to take
[1:19:38] &gt;&gt; when a season arrive
[1:19:41] &gt;&gt; plus the doing
[1:19:43] &gt;&gt; the right act to do. Amen. Because when
[1:19:46] you have a correct instructions,
[1:19:48] now you know what it is. Amen.
[1:19:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:52] &gt;&gt; They know uh how what Israel ought to
[1:19:54] do. The heads of them were 200 and all
[1:19:58] their brethren were at their
[1:20:00] commandment. Amen.
[1:20:02] With this scripture, we found out that
[1:20:06] season has messages.
[1:20:10] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:20:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:11] &gt;&gt; A season got a message. A season got a
[1:20:15] package.
[1:20:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:18] &gt;&gt; And you need to decode the message.
[1:20:21] &gt;&gt; And if you don't decode, it will pass
[1:20:23] through you
[1:20:25] &gt;&gt; and you don't even understand what it
[1:20:27] is. May the Lord add the blessing to the
[1:20:30] reading of the word
[1:20:31] &gt;&gt; in case you were waiting. That's it. The
[1:20:33] Lord add the blessing to the reading of
[1:20:35] his word. Amen.
[1:20:38] So we found out that if you need to
[1:20:41] understand time, there is a message in
[1:20:44] time.
[1:20:45] &gt;&gt; There is a messaging season
[1:20:47] &gt;&gt; and that message need to be understood.
[1:20:51] &gt;&gt; That message need to be discerned.
[1:20:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:55] &gt;&gt; Because in that message there is
[1:20:57] instruction for that specific season.
[1:21:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:00] &gt;&gt; And he will tell you what to do. Amen.
[1:21:04] Because according to Ecclesiastes 3:1,
[1:21:08] we know that the Bible says that to
[1:21:11] everything,
[1:21:13] &gt;&gt; not something to everything. There is
[1:21:15] what?
[1:21:16] &gt;&gt; Season
[1:21:17] &gt;&gt; because everything comes with a season.
[1:21:20] &gt;&gt; So if a season come, something come.
[1:21:23] &gt;&gt; We need to know what came.
[1:21:25] &gt;&gt; What is in the package?
[1:21:27] &gt;&gt; What is going on?
[1:21:29] &gt;&gt; Is this my season? Yes. But what is what
[1:21:31] am I supposed to get in this season?
[1:21:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:37] &gt;&gt; So because season got messages, it is
[1:21:41] important to know how to decode a
[1:21:45] season.
[1:21:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:51] &gt;&gt; Because the problem is how do I know
[1:21:53] that it's my season?
[1:21:56] &gt;&gt; I already have an understanding. You can
[1:21:58] refocus, sister. as I already have an
[1:22:00] understanding that season got something
[1:22:03] for me
[1:22:04] &gt;&gt; that everything in my life have a season
[1:22:07] &gt;&gt; and I don't want to miss a season.
[1:22:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:09] &gt;&gt; Because if I miss a season, I miss
[1:22:11] something.
[1:22:12] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:22:13] &gt;&gt; And I need to stay alert
[1:22:16] &gt;&gt; to know what is coming up in my life.
[1:22:19] &gt;&gt; And the children of Issach have to be
[1:22:21] beside David
[1:22:23] &gt;&gt; to be able to discern the time.
[1:22:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. to discern the sign, to discern
[1:22:29] the season, and to tell David what to
[1:22:32] do. Are we together?
[1:22:34] &gt;&gt; So, David was not strong only in
[1:22:37] &gt;&gt; masses,
[1:22:39] &gt;&gt; he was also strong in wisdom.
[1:22:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:42] &gt;&gt; Strong in discernment,
[1:22:44] &gt;&gt; by the people that God put around him
[1:22:47] &gt;&gt; to help strengthen his kingdom
[1:22:50] &gt;&gt; and see and foresee the future.
[1:22:52] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:22:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Brham says this very
[1:22:56] familiar quote now to this church. He
[1:22:58] said Jesus here was speaking. He said
[1:23:02] father the what?
[1:23:03] &gt;&gt; The time has come.
[1:23:04] &gt;&gt; So time happened.
[1:23:06] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:23:07] &gt;&gt; All time come. So there will be a time
[1:23:10] that is not time.
[1:23:14] &gt;&gt; But there will be a time that is time.
[1:23:18] &gt;&gt; There will be an hour that things must
[1:23:20] happen. Yes.
[1:23:22] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:23:24] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham say now there is season
[1:23:27] for what?
[1:23:28] &gt;&gt; Everything.
[1:23:29] &gt;&gt; Everything have a season. Do you believe
[1:23:31] that?
[1:23:32] &gt;&gt; You saw in a water
[1:23:34] &gt;&gt; certain season
[1:23:35] &gt;&gt; and you reap where?
[1:23:36] &gt;&gt; In a certain season.
[1:23:37] &gt;&gt; That's why it's important to know the
[1:23:39] season.
[1:23:40] &gt;&gt; Because if you don't know that this is a
[1:23:42] sewing time,
[1:23:45] &gt;&gt; you will miss the opportunity to sow.
[1:23:48] And when it's the time to reap, there is
[1:23:50] nothing to reap
[1:23:51] &gt;&gt; because you miss the opportunity to sow.
[1:23:56] &gt;&gt; Many time we regret in our lives.
[1:23:58] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:23:59] &gt;&gt; When we tell somebody that if you put
[1:24:02] $200 aside,
[1:24:04] &gt;&gt; every month,
[1:24:06] &gt;&gt; the person will sit down and say $200 a
[1:24:09] month,
[1:24:10] &gt;&gt; what is it for?
[1:24:12] &gt;&gt; It's not a lot of money.
[1:24:13] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.
[1:24:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. But if you take two, I'm going
[1:24:17] with a simple example. If you take 200 *
[1:24:20] 12,
[1:24:22] &gt;&gt; how much money is it now?
[1:24:26] &gt;&gt; It's 2400, it's $2,400
[1:24:30] a month.
[1:24:32] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:24:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:36] &gt;&gt; How long have we been in this church?
[1:24:42] 2,400
[1:24:44] * 5 is what?
[1:24:49] &gt;&gt; And then Oh, now we begin to talk.
[1:24:51] &gt;&gt; Uh, please come and preach with me.
[1:24:55] &gt;&gt; Get your calculator right there. I'm
[1:24:57] trying to save myself.
[1:25:00] &gt;&gt; Is what?
[1:25:02] &gt;&gt; No, there is a five with a with a four.
[1:25:05] They got to be a zero.
[1:25:08] If not, I'm gonna do the math myself.
[1:25:13] &gt;&gt; If not, I do it myself.
[1:25:19] &gt;&gt; What?
[1:25:20] &gt;&gt; We say 2,400
[1:25:23] * 5.
[1:25:26] &gt;&gt; How much is it?
[1:25:27] &gt;&gt; 12,000.
[1:25:28] &gt;&gt; 12,000.
[1:25:29] &gt;&gt; Everybody agree?
[1:25:31] &gt;&gt; So in this five years, how much money
[1:25:33] should be in your bank account?
[1:25:36] How much money did we lost in five
[1:25:39] years?
[1:25:46] &gt;&gt; I just used $200
[1:25:51] &gt;&gt; a month
[1:25:53] &gt;&gt; today in your bank account.
[1:25:56] &gt;&gt; Everybody should have how much?
[1:26:02] Take $12,000 multiply by your number
[1:26:06] &gt;&gt; in this church. Oh,
[1:26:09] &gt;&gt; I I'm sorry. You know what? Let me
[1:26:12] preach the seventh seal.
[1:26:13] &gt;&gt; No, I'm preaching the sevens here.
[1:26:16] [Applause]
[1:26:17] [Music]
[1:26:20] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:26:22] Okay. Okay. I'm going to pick a number.
[1:26:25] &gt;&gt; Okay. Let me pick a number. We are 100
[1:26:27] people.
[1:26:31] &gt;&gt; We are 100 people.
[1:26:33] &gt;&gt; Oh, you want 120 like in the upper room?
[1:26:40] &gt;&gt; My friend, I'm preaching.
[1:26:43] &gt;&gt; Let's take we 100 people in this church.
[1:26:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:48] &gt;&gt; 100 people in this church that were
[1:26:50] disciplined for five years.
[1:26:52] &gt;&gt; Discipline with $200.
[1:26:55] How much money should we have in this
[1:26:57] church?
[1:26:59] [Music]
[1:27:10] One more.
[1:27:12] [Music]
[1:27:20] &gt;&gt; There you go.
[1:27:23] [Music]
[1:27:31] &gt;&gt; Like that.
[1:27:33] &gt;&gt; Like this.

[1:27:41] &gt;&gt; Shake your neighbor's hand.
[1:27:47] &gt;&gt; Let's stay down.
[1:27:50] &gt;&gt; Let Let's slow down.
[1:27:52] &gt;&gt; Let's slow down.
[1:27:53] &gt;&gt; Let's slow down.
[1:27:55] &gt;&gt; Is a million dollar hard to get?
[1:27:59] &gt;&gt; Because on the day of Pentecost,
[1:28:02] &gt;&gt; they put their things together.
[1:28:04] Ah,
[1:28:05] &gt;&gt; it's written in your Bible.
[1:28:07] &gt;&gt; In the day of Pentecost, when the Holy
[1:28:09] Ghost came,
[1:28:10] &gt;&gt; they took everything and they put it
[1:28:12] together. So, if the anointing of
[1:28:15] Pentecost
[1:28:17] &gt;&gt; anoint us right now and everybody have
[1:28:20] $12,000
[1:28:21] and we put $12,000 together, how much
[1:28:25] will we have?
[1:28:30] &gt;&gt; How much should we have?
[1:28:33] [Music]
[1:28:35] Do we need to borrow money from the
[1:28:36] bank?
[1:28:39] [Applause]
[1:28:42] &gt;&gt; Do you see what I'm saying?
[1:28:44] &gt;&gt; Do you see what I'm saying?
[1:28:46] &gt;&gt; Do you see what I'm saying?
[1:28:48] &gt;&gt; So if I double this toward $400 a month.
[1:28:55] &gt;&gt; We are talking. Come on.
[1:28:59] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:29:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. Do you want me to blow your mind?

[1:29:21] &gt;&gt; Every month. $1,000.
[1:29:24] &gt;&gt; Times 12.
[1:29:26] &gt;&gt; You can criticize. I'm talking to my
[1:29:28] church.
[1:29:30] &gt;&gt; How much is it?
[1:29:32] How much?
[1:29:33] &gt;&gt; 12,000.
[1:29:34] &gt;&gt; A what?
[1:29:34] &gt;&gt; A year.
[1:29:35] &gt;&gt; A year. 12,000 a year times 100 people,
[1:29:43] &gt;&gt; in a year. No, 12,000
[1:29:46] times 100.
[1:29:47] &gt;&gt; Okay. So, we add 0 0 again.
[1:29:51] &gt;&gt; Okay. This is for year. Okay. Times five
[1:29:55] years.
[1:29:57] &gt;&gt; What is it? Please come.
[1:30:03] How How much is it?
[1:30:05] &gt;&gt; Six water.
[1:30:11] &gt;&gt; Is this a big deal?
[1:30:12] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:30:14] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:30:16] &gt;&gt; I hope you are awaken now.
[1:30:20] &gt;&gt; I hope you awaken now.
[1:30:21] &gt;&gt; Because we say, "Lord, give me a big
[1:30:23] job. When you give me a big job, then I
[1:30:25] will have more money.
[1:30:30] It's it's it's passing you
[1:30:33] &gt;&gt; every month. It's passing you.
[1:30:36] &gt;&gt; Amazon got it.
[1:30:40] &gt;&gt; Timu got it. Timu got it.
[1:30:43] &gt;&gt; That's why Tim,
[1:30:47] please help me up. That's why Amazon is
[1:30:51] a billionaire
[1:30:52] because every church in America, Amazon
[1:30:55] is getting money. Timu is getting money.
[1:31:00] &gt;&gt; Tesla is getting money. Those people are
[1:31:02] gleaming everything we just spoke.
[1:31:05] &gt;&gt; That's why the millionaire
[1:31:09] [Applause]
[1:31:17] &gt;&gt; Let's talk about spiritual things.
[1:31:22] &gt;&gt; But you were there yesterday.
[1:31:24] &gt;&gt; You know what? I gave you the quote.
[1:31:28] from the Bible and the quote yesterday.
[1:31:30] You were there.
[1:31:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:34] &gt;&gt; To everything there is a seasonal
[1:31:37] &gt;&gt; and it's important to discern the season
[1:31:41] &gt;&gt; because you will miss your opportunity.
[1:31:43] [Applause]
[1:31:47] &gt;&gt; You going to the bank to borrow what?
[1:31:48] $10,000. You could have put your own
[1:31:51] $10,000 yourself, your own $12,000. You
[1:31:55] want to I mean fix your roof $6,000 and
[1:31:58] crying uh Lord pray prayer request.
[1:32:01] Let's pray request. Prayer request. Your
[1:32:02] prayer request was already there. Answer
[1:32:04] it.
[1:32:09] [Laughter]
[1:32:14] I'm saying you saw in a water
[1:32:16] &gt;&gt; certain season
[1:32:17] &gt;&gt; and you reap in water
[1:32:18] &gt;&gt; certain season
[1:32:19] &gt;&gt; and there is season when the time comes
[1:32:22] &gt;&gt; that is right for don't regret
[1:32:27] &gt;&gt; don't don't sit here begin to regret
[1:32:29] thank God he open your eyes today
[1:32:35] be
[1:32:36] &gt;&gt; because the decision you going to make
[1:32:38] today will determine five years
[1:32:43] &gt;&gt; thank God from today begin to change.
[1:32:47] [Applause]
[1:32:48] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Are we together? And
[1:32:52] brother Brandham said there is season
[1:32:54] when the times come that is right for
[1:32:56] these things were not in my note.
[1:32:59] &gt;&gt; So they are coming from somewhere.
[1:33:01] &gt;&gt; Uh he says and there is season when the
[1:33:04] times comes that is what
[1:33:06] &gt;&gt; right for things
[1:33:07] &gt;&gt; for things to do what
[1:33:08] &gt;&gt; to happen.
[1:33:09] &gt;&gt; In other words the season bring the
[1:33:12] correct time.
[1:33:14] for something to happen.
[1:33:16] &gt;&gt; So season doesn't just bring something.
[1:33:19] &gt;&gt; It brings something and it brings the
[1:33:21] proper time.
[1:33:23] &gt;&gt; In other words, the season will bring
[1:33:25] things that will lock the devil.
[1:33:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:28] &gt;&gt; A certain way. I know why I'm saying a
[1:33:30] certain way. So that things may happen.
[1:33:35] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Because the Bible say
[1:33:37] in Ecclesiastes 3:1 that he God has made
[1:33:42] what
[1:33:44] &gt;&gt; how
[1:33:45] &gt;&gt; beautiful
[1:33:46] &gt;&gt; when.
[1:33:47] &gt;&gt; So if something it's if it's the season
[1:33:51] whatever is going there will come out
[1:33:54] beautiful.
[1:33:57] &gt;&gt; You want a beautiful house wait for the
[1:33:59] season.
[1:34:01] &gt;&gt; You want a beautiful husband? Wait for
[1:34:03] the season. You want a beautiful wife,
[1:34:05] wait for the season. Whatever you want
[1:34:08] to come out beautiful. Make sure it's in
[1:34:11] the season.
[1:34:12] &gt;&gt; If it's in the season, God will back you
[1:34:15] up.
[1:34:17] &gt;&gt; Because God is behind the season.
[1:34:22] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:34:24] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:34:25] &gt;&gt; But brother Stephen,
[1:34:28] the children of Issachar, they were
[1:34:30] discerning season. How do we do that?
[1:34:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:37] &gt;&gt; Oh, thank God. Glory to God.
[1:34:40] &gt;&gt; The Bible says in Matthew 24:32, Jesus
[1:34:43] say, "Now learn
[1:34:47] &gt;&gt; a parable of what?"
[1:34:48] &gt;&gt; The fig tree.
[1:34:51] &gt;&gt; Jesus didn't say go get a seminar.
[1:34:56] [Applause]
[1:34:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:34:59] &gt;&gt; Jesus didn't say go buy books on Amazon.
[1:35:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:04] &gt;&gt; How to decode the season.
[1:35:07] &gt;&gt; Jesus say my instruction.
[1:35:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:10] &gt;&gt; For season
[1:35:11] &gt;&gt; I already gave it to everybody.
[1:35:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:16] &gt;&gt; Jesus say learn a parable of what?
[1:35:21] &gt;&gt; Tree.
[1:35:21] &gt;&gt; So the fig tree that you pass all the
[1:35:24] time
[1:35:25] &gt;&gt; has a message.
[1:35:28] Amen.
[1:35:29] &gt;&gt; He didn't say learn the parable of God.
[1:35:32] &gt;&gt; Learn the parable of the tree.
[1:35:35] &gt;&gt; So the tree got a parable.
[1:35:37] &gt;&gt; The tree got a message.
[1:35:39] &gt;&gt; And Jesus say look at that tree. The
[1:35:41] tree has been talking to you all along.
[1:35:46] &gt;&gt; In other words, God is in nature.
[1:35:50] &gt;&gt; And brother said the first Bible he used
[1:35:53] sir
[1:35:53] &gt;&gt; was nature. That's why Paul in Romans
[1:35:57] 1:20 say for the invisible things of him
[1:36:02] &gt;&gt; of God from the creation of the world
[1:36:05] are clearly what
[1:36:10] &gt;&gt; being understood you see it first then
[1:36:13] you understood by the things that are
[1:36:16] water
[1:36:17] &gt;&gt; in other words if you look at what God
[1:36:19] have created
[1:36:21] &gt;&gt; and how God is running nature God is
[1:36:24] talking to you plainly.
[1:36:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:27] &gt;&gt; If there is a winter, there must be a
[1:36:30] spring.
[1:36:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:32] &gt;&gt; If there is a winter, there must be a
[1:36:34] spring.
[1:36:35] &gt;&gt; Until you can even predict the clothing.
[1:36:39] &gt;&gt; You can predict what is coming up.
[1:36:42] &gt;&gt; So if a winter is happening in your
[1:36:44] life,
[1:36:45] &gt;&gt; what should follow the winter?
[1:36:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:53] Amen. He says, "For the things are
[1:36:56] clearly seen and being what?"
[1:36:58] &gt;&gt; understood
[1:36:59] &gt;&gt; by the things that are what made
[1:37:01] &gt;&gt; even his what?
[1:37:03] &gt;&gt; eternal power
[1:37:04] &gt;&gt; and his what
[1:37:05] &gt;&gt; and Godhead
[1:37:05] &gt;&gt; so that they are how?
[1:37:07] &gt;&gt; Without excuse.
[1:37:08] &gt;&gt; In other words, if you look at nature,
[1:37:10] you will understand Godhead.
[1:37:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:12] &gt;&gt; This is what Paul is saying.
[1:37:14] &gt;&gt; Paul is saying if you look at nature,
[1:37:16] you will see the eternal power of God.
[1:37:19] You will see a tree going and dying and
[1:37:22] coming back in resurrection and coming
[1:37:24] back in resurrection. So every spring
[1:37:26] it's talking about a resurrection
[1:37:29] &gt;&gt; because God is speaking through nature.
[1:37:32] &gt;&gt; So your answer are already nature.
[1:37:34] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:37:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:39] &gt;&gt; Don't worry my friend. Jesus said learn
[1:37:42] a parable of what?
[1:37:43] &gt;&gt; The fig tree.
[1:37:44] &gt;&gt; When his branch is yet what? tender
[1:37:47] &gt;&gt; and putting forth water.
[1:37:49] &gt;&gt; Which month are which season are we in?
[1:37:52] &gt;&gt; Spring. Ye know that water
[1:37:54] &gt;&gt; summer is nine.
[1:37:55] &gt;&gt; So Jesus is telling us learn the fig
[1:37:59] tree. Whenever you see something
[1:38:01] happening to the fig tree, you can
[1:38:03] predict what is happening next.
[1:38:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. If you see the fig tree in with
[1:38:12] the leaves begin to bad and everything,
[1:38:15] you automatically know that you know
[1:38:17] what? Spring is coming.
[1:38:19] &gt;&gt; And when you see spring, you
[1:38:20] automatically know that what? Summer is
[1:38:23] coming. And when you come into summer,
[1:38:25] you know that it don't it won't take too
[1:38:26] long. Fall is coming. When you get in
[1:38:29] fall, you know that winter is coming.
[1:38:31] It's all clear.
[1:38:33] &gt;&gt; Brother Steven, Jesus says again in Luke
[1:38:36] right here about the same thing. He
[1:38:38] said, "And he spake to them a parable,
[1:38:41] saying, behold what?"
[1:38:43] &gt;&gt; fig tree.
[1:38:43] &gt;&gt; And all the trees,
[1:38:46] &gt;&gt; not only the fig tree now, but every
[1:38:48] single trees, when they now shoot forth,
[1:38:51] ye see, and know of your own self that
[1:38:54] water
[1:38:54] &gt;&gt; summer is now at.
[1:38:55] &gt;&gt; In other words, when you investigate,
[1:38:58] when you observe all the trees, you can
[1:39:01] tell which season is coming.
[1:39:04] &gt;&gt; Are we together? I know you want a
[1:39:06] specific instruction for men, but I'm
[1:39:08] going with trees
[1:39:10] &gt;&gt; because a tree represent man.
[1:39:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:14] &gt;&gt; A tree represent you.
[1:39:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. When you begin to put forth bad,
[1:39:19] something is happening. When a young man
[1:39:22] begin to change his voice.
[1:39:28] [Applause]
[1:39:30] &gt;&gt; When a young boy that used to be mommy
[1:39:33] mommy mommy mommy and suddenly he's like
[1:39:36] mom it's a season that is happening.
[1:39:40] Amen.
[1:39:43] &gt;&gt; A young sister that used to be looking
[1:39:46] slam and suddenly she begin to have some
[1:39:49] excellent tournament a season. Oh, she
[1:39:52] begin to b
[1:39:54] &gt;&gt; this is what the Bible say. Amen. It is
[1:39:57] telling you she's entering a season.
[1:40:00] [Applause]
[1:40:02] &gt;&gt; If mommy is distracted or daddy's
[1:40:05] distracted, they will miss the proper
[1:40:09] instruction. to give to the children at
[1:40:12] that specific time.
[1:40:14] &gt;&gt; In other words, when the voice have
[1:40:16] changed, it is time for daddy to talk to
[1:40:19] the boy.
[1:40:20] &gt;&gt; When the excellent tournament begin to
[1:40:22] come up, it's time for mommy to set the
[1:40:25] girl aside
[1:40:26] &gt;&gt; and begin to give her instruction of the
[1:40:29] future.
[1:40:30] &gt;&gt; It doesn't mean the boy is ready to get
[1:40:32] married. It doesn't mean the young 13
[1:40:35] years old is ready to get married but
[1:40:38] you are preparing them for the oncoming
[1:40:41] &gt;&gt; for the next
[1:40:43] &gt;&gt; for the next season
[1:40:45] &gt;&gt; because I I mean puberty is telling you
[1:40:48] the next season
[1:40:50] &gt;&gt; spring is talking about summer
[1:40:52] &gt;&gt; puberty is talking about marriage
[1:40:56] &gt;&gt; but it's not marriage yet
[1:40:58] &gt;&gt; but if you see you lose the opportunity
[1:41:01] somebody else will teach your children.
[1:41:04] Yes, sir.
[1:41:05] &gt;&gt; The internet will teach your children.
[1:41:08] &gt;&gt; Your neighbor will teach your children.
[1:41:11] &gt;&gt; The education in school will teach your
[1:41:13] children.
[1:41:14] &gt;&gt; So, we need to stay alert.
[1:41:16] &gt;&gt; And watch the symptom.
[1:41:23] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:41:25] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:41:26] &gt;&gt; Why do we do a baby shower?
[1:41:32] because somebody's coming
[1:41:35] &gt;&gt; the that person have not come out yet
[1:41:38] &gt;&gt; but that person is announcing the coming
[1:41:41] &gt;&gt; so we don't want that person to come and
[1:41:43] we are not prepared
[1:41:46] &gt;&gt; are we together I'm going elementary so
[1:41:49] we can pick it up Jesus says this my
[1:41:52] friend in the book of Luke 12:54
[1:41:55] he said and he said also to the people
[1:41:58] when We see a cloud do what
[1:42:01] &gt;&gt; rise out of the west
[1:42:02] &gt;&gt; straight away he say there come a water
[1:42:04] &gt;&gt; shower.
[1:42:05] &gt;&gt; In other word we are professional about
[1:42:08] discerning everything else except our
[1:42:10] lives.
[1:42:12] [Music]
[1:42:14] &gt;&gt; If you look at the weather it's going to
[1:42:15] rain.
[1:42:16] &gt;&gt; Who taught you that?
[1:42:18] &gt;&gt; Which school did you go to?
[1:42:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:22] &gt;&gt; But when they say discern my life how am
[1:42:24] I going to discern my life by Steven?
[1:42:26] How should I know what the season is?
[1:42:28] How did you know the other stuff? Who
[1:42:30] taught you that?
[1:42:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. Jesus says, "And when he see the
[1:42:34] south wind doing what?"
[1:42:36] &gt;&gt; He said, "There will be what?"
[1:42:38] &gt;&gt; And it come to pass. In other words, it
[1:42:40] happened.
[1:42:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. Your weather man.
[1:42:44] &gt;&gt; Your weather man can even predict a
[1:42:46] hurricane.
[1:42:49] &gt;&gt; And they will tell you that hurricane
[1:42:50] will pass this way. And it happened.
[1:42:52] Amen.
[1:42:53] &gt;&gt; Men with intelligence
[1:42:55] &gt;&gt; begin to predict what is coming up.
[1:42:58] &gt;&gt; What about spiritual people?
[1:43:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:00] &gt;&gt; Jesus say, "Ye hypocrite.
[1:43:04] &gt;&gt; Ye can discern the what?
[1:43:06] &gt;&gt; The face of the sky
[1:43:07] &gt;&gt; and of what?
[1:43:08] &gt;&gt; The earth,
[1:43:09] &gt;&gt; but how is it that you do not discern
[1:43:12] this time?"
[1:43:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:14] &gt;&gt; In other words, Jesus is saying, if you
[1:43:16] can discern all of this,
[1:43:18] &gt;&gt; how come
[1:43:19] &gt;&gt; you cannot discern the time? Amen.
[1:43:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:23] &gt;&gt; In other words, God already train you
[1:43:27] &gt;&gt; by the discernment of natural things
[1:43:31] &gt;&gt; for a purpose.
[1:43:32] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:43:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:35] &gt;&gt; William Marion Brham. Don't worry my
[1:43:38] friend. Brother Brham is the in the
[1:43:40] message the uniting time and son.
[1:43:43] Brother Brham say we are talking of this
[1:43:45] uniting
[1:43:47] &gt;&gt; uniting what? the son of the uniting
[1:43:50] time. See, Jesus was here in this last
[1:43:54] scripture reading. He was rebuking the
[1:43:57] clergy for not being able to discern the
[1:44:00] time
[1:44:01] &gt;&gt; or the son of the time.
[1:44:04] &gt;&gt; Now, that has always been a great thing
[1:44:08] to the people. See, to be able to do
[1:44:11] what?
[1:44:12] &gt;&gt; Discern the sign.
[1:44:13] &gt;&gt; Discern the sign of the time that you
[1:44:16] are living. Because God ride it how
[1:44:20] &gt;&gt; so that nobody could escape it.
[1:44:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:25] &gt;&gt; In other words, God put everything plan
[1:44:29] &gt;&gt; that no one will be without excuse.
[1:44:33] &gt;&gt; God is speaking. When you going out, God
[1:44:35] is talking.
[1:44:37] &gt;&gt; When you watch the television, God is
[1:44:39] talking.
[1:44:41] &gt;&gt; When you go to Walmart, God is saying
[1:44:43] something.
[1:44:44] &gt;&gt; But we don't know how to read it. Yes.
[1:44:48] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:44:48] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:44:50] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:44:51] &gt;&gt; And sometimes season comes
[1:44:56] a change in season comes
[1:45:00] in a sign of trouble.
[1:45:05] [Applause]
[1:45:10] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Amen.
[1:45:12] &gt;&gt; The season you are acquainted with is
[1:45:15] when everything is moving smoothly.
[1:45:20] &gt;&gt; Ah, it's a season.
[1:45:21] &gt;&gt; Ah, it's a season. Ah, it's a season.
[1:45:25] Ah, it a season. But season also changes
[1:45:29] by trouble.
[1:45:34] &gt;&gt; I'm I'm getting there. Amen.
[1:45:36] And that one is the hardest one
[1:45:39] &gt;&gt; for the Christian to get it.
[1:45:44] &gt;&gt; Because the devil already work on our
[1:45:46] mind for so long.
[1:45:49] &gt;&gt; The devil already work on preachers for
[1:45:52] so long.
[1:45:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. And we are wired to only look on
[1:45:57] the negative.
[1:46:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:05] Amen.
[1:46:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:06] &gt;&gt; When you sit at your doctor,
[1:46:08] &gt;&gt; go ahead, brother.
[1:46:09] &gt;&gt; What is the doctor looking for?
[1:46:12] &gt;&gt; Something good.
[1:46:16] &gt;&gt; I'm asking you a question.
[1:46:18] &gt;&gt; The doctor is trying to find out. What?
[1:46:21] &gt;&gt; When you sit at your dentist and you
[1:46:23] open your mouth, what is the dentist
[1:46:25] screening your teeth for?
[1:46:27] &gt;&gt; To find something good.
[1:46:29] &gt;&gt; He's trying to find what?
[1:46:30] &gt;&gt; So, we are trained to see bad.
[1:46:38] Have I said something wrong?
[1:46:40] &gt;&gt; Have I said something wrong?
[1:46:42] &gt;&gt; If you go to a mar to a reception and
[1:46:45] everybody's dressed well, everybody look
[1:46:48] beautiful and nice and one person maybe
[1:46:51] a sinner walk out there and dress wrong.
[1:46:54] You will forget everybody else.
[1:46:56] &gt;&gt; You will remember only that woman that
[1:46:59] came in that was dressed wrong. How was
[1:47:02] the party? The party was good, but there
[1:47:05] was a woman.
[1:47:08] I'm telling you that bad.
[1:47:11] &gt;&gt; Am I saying something wrong?
[1:47:14] &gt;&gt; Are we together? If I tell you what,
[1:47:18] I'm I'm taking off, my friend. What do
[1:47:20] you see here?
[1:47:22] &gt;&gt; What do you see here?
[1:47:24] &gt;&gt; What do you see here?
[1:47:26] &gt;&gt; And what do you see here?
[1:47:29] &gt;&gt; Why? Why you don't see this?
[1:47:32] Why you don't see all of this?
[1:47:34] &gt;&gt; What do you see?
[1:47:37] &gt;&gt; What do you see?
[1:47:38] &gt;&gt; Everybody say I see a dot.
[1:47:41] &gt;&gt; Nobody say I see a big white board with
[1:47:44] a dot.
[1:47:46] &gt;&gt; But the dot have taken over everything.
[1:47:49] &gt;&gt; So your focus is wrong.
[1:47:52] [Applause]
[1:47:56] &gt;&gt; I'm leaving the airport, my friend. Your
[1:47:59] focus is wrong. You focus too much on
[1:48:02] the wrong thing
[1:48:05] &gt;&gt; and the focus on the wrong thing make
[1:48:08] you lose everything here.
[1:48:14] [Applause]
[1:48:20] &gt;&gt; You will miss your husband for one dot.
[1:48:32] Because according to the message the
[1:48:35] according to the message people your
[1:48:38] husband must be perfect.
[1:48:40] &gt;&gt; And now the young man need to act
[1:48:43] hypocritically.
[1:48:44] [Applause]
[1:48:49] &gt;&gt; Are we are we together?
[1:48:51] &gt;&gt; He might be not talking a good English
[1:48:54] but he have a golden heart.
[1:48:57] You can meet your wife for one
[1:49:05] &gt;&gt; what we are looking at. We want the
[1:49:08] board to be clear.
[1:49:09] &gt;&gt; And then when we see the white the black
[1:49:12] dot, we know what to work on.
[1:49:16] &gt;&gt; We don't want a black board
[1:49:18] &gt;&gt; with a white dot.
[1:49:20] &gt;&gt; We want a white board. But we know there
[1:49:22] are some imperfection. But where as time
[1:49:26] goes on, God will iron those
[1:49:28] imperfection and make us looking good.
[1:49:36] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:49:38] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:49:40] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:49:47] &gt;&gt; Open your Bible.
[1:49:49] &gt;&gt; Let's go to the book of Exodus.
[1:49:54] Thank you. We took off the airport.
[1:49:56] We're still climbing, my friend.
[1:49:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:02] &gt;&gt; Let's go to Exodus. Exodus chapter 1.
[1:50:07] &gt;&gt; We're talking about the right focus
[1:50:11] &gt;&gt; in season.
[1:50:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:18] &gt;&gt; You know the whole story how Israel
[1:50:20] move. Uh-huh.
[1:50:22] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:50:26] &gt;&gt; Last Sunday we talk about Samson.
[1:50:30] &gt;&gt; The the the the the most horrible time
[1:50:34] of Samson was only a shift
[1:50:37] &gt;&gt; from natural eye
[1:50:39] &gt;&gt; to faith.
[1:50:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:43] &gt;&gt; When Joseph was changing his garment,
[1:50:47] &gt;&gt; he always took trouble.
[1:50:51] Yes sir.
[1:50:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:54] &gt;&gt; This brother hated him, sold him.
[1:50:58] &gt;&gt; And the Bible say, I believe it was
[1:51:00] Reuben or someone say that Joseph begged
[1:51:03] them.
[1:51:03] &gt;&gt; It's written in the Bible.
[1:51:05] &gt;&gt; The Bible say he besought them please,
[1:51:07] please, please no out
[1:51:11] &gt;&gt; that is not here. Ah
[1:51:13] &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus, where are you? You the
[1:51:15] present help in the time of trouble.
[1:51:17] &gt;&gt; It looks like the help is not there.
[1:51:19] Amen.
[1:51:21] &gt;&gt; Leader did Joseph knew
[1:51:23] &gt;&gt; that he was shifting season
[1:51:26] &gt;&gt; when he got in body for how everything
[1:51:29] good
[1:51:30] &gt;&gt; to shift the season and
[1:51:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:38] &gt;&gt; So season changes sometime with
[1:51:42] &gt;&gt; troublemen
[1:51:45] &gt;&gt; with tragedy.
[1:51:46] [Applause]
[1:51:48] I'm teaching you how to discern season
[1:51:51] &gt;&gt; in every way.
[1:51:53] &gt;&gt; It might change when it's good time
[1:51:56] &gt;&gt; but also when bad time are coming. Watch
[1:51:58] out.
[1:52:01] [Applause]
[1:52:03] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:52:04] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:52:06] &gt;&gt; Israel moved to Egypt.
[1:52:09] &gt;&gt; We clear?
[1:52:12] &gt;&gt; Let me drop this.
[1:52:15] How did Joseph go to Egypt?
[1:52:20] &gt;&gt; What happened to his family? What
[1:52:22] happened to him?
[1:52:25] &gt;&gt; He was sold because of hatred.
[1:52:31] &gt;&gt; It took hatred
[1:52:33] &gt;&gt; and jealousy.
[1:52:35] &gt;&gt; That's what happened.
[1:52:37] &gt;&gt; It took hatred. Follow me, my friend. It
[1:52:40] took hatred
[1:52:41] &gt;&gt; and jealousy to move Israel
[1:52:45] &gt;&gt; to Egypt.
[1:52:48] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:52:50] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:52:52] &gt;&gt; It took hatred.
[1:52:53] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:52:56] &gt;&gt; And jealousy
[1:52:59] &gt;&gt; and a prophet
[1:53:03] &gt;&gt; to move Israel,
[1:53:06] not just Joseph. Because at the end of
[1:53:08] the day, the whole the whole village
[1:53:12] &gt;&gt; moved to Egypt.
[1:53:14] &gt;&gt; But for God to move them, God didn't
[1:53:17] come and say, "Hey, thus say the Lord,
[1:53:19] arise and all of you go to Egypt."
[1:53:22] &gt;&gt; It took hatred.
[1:53:25] &gt;&gt; It took jealousy. It took a prophet
[1:53:28] &gt;&gt; by the name of Joseph to move Israel
[1:53:32] toward Egypt.
[1:53:35] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:53:35] &gt;&gt; Are we together? And Joseph later on say
[1:53:39] that it was God
[1:53:41] &gt;&gt; that did it.
[1:53:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:46] &gt;&gt; It's it's in your Bible, my friend.
[1:53:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:49] &gt;&gt; Now, if it took hatred,
[1:53:53] &gt;&gt; we we are together.
[1:53:55] &gt;&gt; And jealousy and a prophet to move
[1:53:58] Israel to Egypt.
[1:54:00] What do you think need to to beh
[1:54:04] &gt;&gt; to take Israel from Egypt back to the
[1:54:06] promised land?
[1:54:15] &gt;&gt; The prophet here is Joseph.
[1:54:19] &gt;&gt; I'm going to go slowly again because
[1:54:21] some didn't catch
[1:54:23] &gt;&gt; for Israel. You know the whole story.
[1:54:25] I'm trying to save time so we can move
[1:54:27] on. You know the whole story. It took
[1:54:29] hatred of Joseph brother.
[1:54:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:31] &gt;&gt; It took jealousy of Joseph brother. And
[1:54:34] it took the prophet himself to push
[1:54:37] Israel toward Egypt.
[1:54:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:40] &gt;&gt; Until the whole tribe, everybody
[1:54:42] everybody went and stay right there.
[1:54:45] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:54:46] &gt;&gt; And even Joseph was dead and buried
[1:54:48] Egypt. Yes.
[1:54:49] &gt;&gt; And he said, "When you go out and pick
[1:54:51] up my bones,
[1:54:53] &gt;&gt; if it takes these three element
[1:54:55] &gt;&gt; to bring Israel to Egypt,
[1:54:58] &gt;&gt; what do you think
[1:55:00] would take to bring Israel from Egypt
[1:55:03] back to the promised land?
[1:55:06] &gt;&gt; It must be what?
[1:55:08] &gt;&gt; It must be what?
[1:55:10] &gt;&gt; It must be hatred
[1:55:12] &gt;&gt; from the Egyptian.
[1:55:14] It must be jealousy
[1:55:16] &gt;&gt; because because Israel begin to prosper
[1:55:20] &gt;&gt; and he must be a prophet
[1:55:23] &gt;&gt; by the name of Moses.
[1:55:28] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:55:29] &gt;&gt; So if Israel is really spiritual when
[1:55:33] they begin to see jealousy
[1:55:39] &gt;&gt; and hatred
[1:55:41] &gt;&gt; and a profit on the sin. It means it's
[1:55:45] what?
[1:55:47] &gt;&gt; It's a different season.
[1:55:50] &gt;&gt; I don't know if we together.
[1:55:52] &gt;&gt; I
[1:55:58] &gt;&gt; don't worry my friend.
[1:56:00] &gt;&gt; Don't worry, my friend.
[1:56:02] &gt;&gt; If he takes hatred,
[1:56:05] &gt;&gt; jealousy
[1:56:06] &gt;&gt; and profit.
[1:56:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:11] &gt;&gt; Alpha.
[1:56:15] to take Israel back to Egypt to Egypt.
[1:56:18] &gt;&gt; To move Israel from Egypt
[1:56:21] &gt;&gt; back over there, he must take Omega.
[1:56:28] &gt;&gt; That's right. If it took the son of man
[1:56:31] ministry to bring the resurrection
[1:56:33] of the dead
[1:56:39] &gt;&gt; and Ephesis people die, people die.
[1:56:43] Tatian people die to raise everybody
[1:56:45] else. It must take what kind of
[1:56:47] ministry?
[1:56:49] &gt;&gt; Watch what brought you where you are.
[1:56:51] Amen.
[1:56:57] &gt;&gt; Watch what push you toward where you
[1:56:59] are.
[1:57:00] &gt;&gt; God will use the same thing to pull you
[1:57:03] out.
[1:57:10] &gt;&gt; Some of you are not catching.
[1:57:12] &gt;&gt; Let's go to the scripture.
[1:57:14] &gt;&gt; Exodus chapter one.
[1:57:17] &gt;&gt; If you there, you can say amen. Amen.
[1:57:21] &gt;&gt; I hope I won't be too long.
[1:57:23] &gt;&gt; Exodus 1 verse 6. If you dare, you can
[1:57:26] say amen.
[1:57:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:27] &gt;&gt; And Joseph did what?
[1:57:29] &gt;&gt; Die.
[1:57:30] &gt;&gt; Uh-huh. Everything is good. And all his
[1:57:32] brethren and all that what?
[1:57:34] &gt;&gt; Generation.
[1:57:34] &gt;&gt; In other words, that whole generation,
[1:57:36] everybody did.
[1:57:38] &gt;&gt; We clear?
[1:57:39] &gt;&gt; Are we clear?
[1:57:40] &gt;&gt; And the children of Israel were how
[1:57:43] &gt;&gt; fruitful.
[1:57:43] &gt;&gt; Fruitful where?
[1:57:45] &gt;&gt; In Egypt.
[1:57:46] &gt;&gt; Not in the promised land.
[1:57:48] fruitful in Egypt.
[1:57:50] &gt;&gt; Even after the death of Joseph,
[1:57:52] &gt;&gt; Israel was prospering.
[1:57:54] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:57:55] &gt;&gt; And increased in water,
[1:57:57] &gt;&gt; abundant
[1:57:58] &gt;&gt; and multiply and what succeedingly what
[1:58:01] mighty
[1:58:02] &gt;&gt; and the land was filled with them.
[1:58:06] &gt;&gt; In other words, a new nation came to
[1:58:08] this nation and then and that small
[1:58:10] nation is taking over.
[1:58:14] A young boy came to the family of 10
[1:58:19] &gt;&gt; and now he's taking off our daddy.
[1:58:27] &gt;&gt; So Israel begin to go and the Egyptian
[1:58:29] are looking at them like
[1:58:35] &gt;&gt; Lord I don't know what's going on with
[1:58:37] that Egyptian. We used to be friend
[1:58:40] &gt;&gt; but since I open five business I don't
[1:58:42] know what's going on.
[1:58:44] &gt;&gt; There was a season
[1:58:47] &gt;&gt; a season was changing.
[1:58:48] &gt;&gt; We're going to get somewhere.
[1:58:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:51] &gt;&gt; And verse 8 the Bible say and there
[1:58:54] arose up a what?
[1:58:55] &gt;&gt; A new king over Egypt
[1:58:57] &gt;&gt; which knew not what?
[1:58:58] &gt;&gt; Joseph.
[1:58:59] &gt;&gt; How can a king I mean who's here who
[1:59:02] doesn't know I mean George Washington.
[1:59:07] Who's here who doesn't know George
[1:59:08] Washington? Who's here who doesn't know
[1:59:10] George Washington? How can a king arose
[1:59:13] after everything that Joseph did and
[1:59:16] saved the entire world and a king rose
[1:59:19] and did not know Joseph? If you look
[1:59:22] here, all that the Bible is saying is a
[1:59:25] king rose.
[1:59:28] &gt;&gt; So when you look, you say, "Lord,
[1:59:33] for some reason there is a new king
[1:59:35] right here. He doesn't like us.
[1:59:39] &gt;&gt; This is the devil,
[1:59:42] &gt;&gt; man. This is the devil. We need to pray
[1:59:44] for this king because Satan is using him
[1:59:47] so much.
[1:59:49] &gt;&gt; We clear, right?
[1:59:50] &gt;&gt; We clear so far.
[1:59:52] &gt;&gt; We clear right
[1:59:53] &gt;&gt; now. Let's go to Acts 7. According to
[1:59:57] Exodus, we were fine.
[1:59:59] &gt;&gt; We were at peace. We were prospering.
[2:00:02] And suddenly, the devil is bringing a
[2:00:04] king. Yes.
[2:00:07] &gt;&gt; And that king now is putting everybody
[2:00:11] uncomfortable.
[2:00:12] &gt;&gt; Let's go to Acts chapter 7, my friend,
[2:00:15] &gt;&gt; as we dragging. Amen. We moving.
[2:00:18] &gt;&gt; You there?
[2:00:20] &gt;&gt; Act chapter 7. If you dare, you can say
[2:00:22] amen.
[2:00:23] &gt;&gt; Act chapter 7. Let's go to verse 17.
[2:00:28] If you there, you can say amen.
[2:00:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:31] &gt;&gt; But
[2:00:36] We clear? Ah, praise the Lord, my
[2:00:38] friend. Hallelujah. But
[2:00:41] &gt;&gt; when the what?
[2:00:42] &gt;&gt; Time of the promise.
[2:00:44] &gt;&gt; When the time of the promise did what?
[2:00:47] &gt;&gt; True. Now,
[2:00:48] &gt;&gt; so now Stephen is opening a different
[2:00:51] angle.
[2:00:53] He said, "Hey, before you focus on the
[2:00:55] Pharaoh,
[2:00:58] &gt;&gt; before you focus on the hatred,
[2:01:01] &gt;&gt; before you focus on the jealousy,
[2:01:04] &gt;&gt; before you focus on how bad Pharaoh,
[2:01:09] how ungrateful
[2:01:12] &gt;&gt; is Pharaoh after everything we did to
[2:01:15] his nation?" Before you begin to focus
[2:01:17] about that, Stephen say, "Watch out."
[2:01:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. There is something that happened
[2:01:22] in the spiritual realm.
[2:01:25] &gt;&gt; Are we together? What happened in the
[2:01:27] spiritual realm is what? The time
[2:01:31] &gt;&gt; of the promise did what?
[2:01:34] &gt;&gt; In other words, another season was
[2:01:36] approaching.
[2:01:38] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together.
[2:01:39] &gt;&gt; Another spring was approaching.
[2:01:42] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Stephen says, "But when
[2:01:45] the time of the promise did what?
[2:01:48] Junah which God swn to what?
[2:01:52] &gt;&gt; Abraham.
[2:01:52] &gt;&gt; So Stephen is first going to the
[2:01:54] covenant.
[2:01:55] &gt;&gt; Yes, that's right.
[2:01:57] &gt;&gt; Son to Abraham. Come the people did
[2:02:00] what?
[2:02:00] &gt;&gt; Grew and multiplied in Egypt. So the
[2:02:03] people in other words there was an
[2:02:05] anointing of blessing
[2:02:08] &gt;&gt; that came and Israel did not understand
[2:02:10] why they are multiplying
[2:02:13] &gt;&gt; but he was a son
[2:02:16] &gt;&gt; that the time of the promise was
[2:02:18] approaching
[2:02:19] &gt;&gt; and God must do something in Israel that
[2:02:23] will raise jealousy
[2:02:27] &gt;&gt; and hatred.
[2:02:28] &gt;&gt; I'm going somewhere my friend.
[2:02:31] &gt;&gt; We clear? Wow.
[2:02:32] &gt;&gt; Verse 8 uh 18. Until what?
[2:02:36] &gt;&gt; Another king arose.
[2:02:38] &gt;&gt; So the king didn't just come like that.
[2:02:41] &gt;&gt; Before the king arose.
[2:02:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:45] &gt;&gt; The promise, the timing, the season was
[2:02:47] already changing.
[2:02:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:50] &gt;&gt; And when the season begin to change,
[2:02:52] Israel begin to b
[2:02:55] &gt;&gt; and to shoot forth. I hope you are
[2:02:57] understanding me.
[2:02:58] &gt;&gt; And to bring forth.
[2:03:00] Then suddenly a king is following the
[2:03:03] prosperity. The Bible say until another
[2:03:07] king arose which knew not what
[2:03:11] &gt;&gt; so according to act it is not just the
[2:03:14] king arose.
[2:03:15] &gt;&gt; No it is connected to a change in time
[2:03:19] &gt;&gt; to a change in season. The time has come
[2:03:23] &gt;&gt; that something must happen.
[2:03:25] &gt;&gt; Are we clear so far?
[2:03:27] &gt;&gt; Now let's go to the book of Romans.
[2:03:30] Romans chapter nine very easy my friend
[2:03:35] then we will sore
[2:03:37] if you there you can say amen.
[2:03:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:39] &gt;&gt; Roman chapter 9 verse 16. If you there
[2:03:44] you can say amen.
[2:03:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:46] &gt;&gt; The Bible say so then it is not of him
[2:03:50] that wills
[2:03:53] &gt;&gt; or willth nor of him that do what?
[2:03:56] &gt;&gt; Runth.
[2:03:57] &gt;&gt; But it's of who? God that showeth mercy.
[2:03:59] &gt;&gt; Everything depend on who?
[2:04:01] &gt;&gt; God.
[2:04:03] &gt;&gt; We clear.
[2:04:04] &gt;&gt; Verse 17. For the scripture says to who?
[2:04:08] &gt;&gt; Pharaoh.
[2:04:08] &gt;&gt; That Pharaoh that didn't know Joseph.
[2:04:11] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:04:12] &gt;&gt; The scripture says to Pharaoh,
[2:04:15] even for this same what?
[2:04:18] &gt;&gt; Purpose
[2:04:18] &gt;&gt; have what?
[2:04:19] &gt;&gt; I raised him.
[2:04:20] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. Who's I?
[2:04:21] &gt;&gt; God.
[2:04:22] &gt;&gt; God.
[2:04:24] He say even for the same purpose have I
[2:04:28] God raised you up. So who rose Pharaoh?
[2:04:37] &gt;&gt; Is he the devil?
[2:04:39] &gt;&gt; Are we clear now?
[2:04:41] &gt;&gt; Who's responsible for it?
[2:04:45] &gt;&gt; So if you look at Pharaoh angry toward
[2:04:47] you,
[2:04:48] &gt;&gt; who is behind that?
[2:04:52] Why is Pharaoh angry?
[2:04:54] &gt;&gt; Because a season
[2:04:56] &gt;&gt; is changing.
[2:04:58] &gt;&gt; Are we clear?
[2:04:59] &gt;&gt; Follow me, my friend. The Bible say,
[2:05:01] "Even for this same purpose have I
[2:05:03] raised you up that I may show my power
[2:05:07] in you."
[2:05:08] &gt;&gt; God chose Pharaoh
[2:05:11] &gt;&gt; to demonstrate his power through him.
[2:05:15] The very thing that is bothering you, it
[2:05:18] is God that chose it.
[2:05:21] &gt;&gt; It is God that brought it.
[2:05:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:26] &gt;&gt; You can look it as the devil
[2:05:29] &gt;&gt; or you can look it as God.
[2:05:32] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:05:34] &gt;&gt; If you keep focusing that it's the
[2:05:36] devil,
[2:05:37] &gt;&gt; you will miss the exodus.
[2:05:40] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. I hope we are
[2:05:43] together.
[2:05:44] &gt;&gt; The Bible say he raised him up for what?
[2:05:47] To show my power in you that my what?
[2:05:51] &gt;&gt; My name might be declared to what?
[2:05:53] &gt;&gt; All the earth.
[2:05:54] &gt;&gt; Why didn't he use Abraham?
[2:05:58] &gt;&gt; Why didn't he use Joseph himself? He
[2:06:01] chose a pharaoh,
[2:06:02] &gt;&gt; a gentile. God pick him up that through
[2:06:06] that gentile, that bad man, that wicked
[2:06:09] man, God can use it so that his name
[2:06:12] &gt;&gt; can go up.
[2:06:14] &gt;&gt; So when you look at Pharaoh, what do you
[2:06:17] see?
[2:06:20] &gt;&gt; Do you see the devil or do you see God?
[2:06:23] &gt;&gt; But according to the Bible, it was God.
[2:06:27] &gt;&gt; But God was changing season. using
[2:06:30] something bad.
[2:06:37] &gt;&gt; The problem that is arriving in your
[2:06:40] life,
[2:06:41] &gt;&gt; they have a meaning.
[2:06:44] &gt;&gt; That's why the Bible say all things
[2:06:48] &gt;&gt; all things
[2:06:49] &gt;&gt; are working together for what?
[2:06:52] &gt;&gt; As bad as you look, there is a message.
[2:06:55] [Applause]
[2:06:58] Are we together?
[2:07:00] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:07:01] &gt;&gt; Listen to brother Brandham. Glory to
[2:07:03] God. In the message, the exposition of
[2:07:07] the seven church ages. Amen.
[2:07:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:10] &gt;&gt; Brother Brham says this about season.
[2:07:13] Brother Brham say if I can just think of
[2:07:16] season, you can get a very good picture
[2:07:19] of this. The plant that you see growing
[2:07:22] in full strength when now
[2:07:24] &gt;&gt; in summer
[2:07:25] &gt;&gt; suddenly appear to be what? Going to
[2:07:27] &gt;&gt; autumn.
[2:07:28] &gt;&gt; You can't tell exactly when summer
[2:07:32] became autumn.
[2:07:37] &gt;&gt; You don't wake up in the morning and say
[2:07:39] winter.
[2:07:41] &gt;&gt; No. Winter give you signal.
[2:07:44] &gt;&gt; And the signal is for preparation.
[2:07:47] &gt;&gt; It's not really cold yet. It's not
[2:07:50] really snowing yet,
[2:07:52] &gt;&gt; but you can begin to feel the little
[2:07:54] chill
[2:07:55] &gt;&gt; and you begin to know that it's time to
[2:07:57] check your air conditioning.
[2:07:59] &gt;&gt; It is time to begin to buy the I mean a
[2:08:02] different change of clothing.
[2:08:04] &gt;&gt; Why? Because winter is coming.
[2:08:07] &gt;&gt; It's time to airate the ground
[2:08:10] &gt;&gt; because winter is coming.
[2:08:12] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:08:13] &gt;&gt; Brother Brham say you can't tell exactly
[2:08:16] when summer became what? It just does
[2:08:19] what?
[2:08:20] &gt;&gt; That is how the ages are. Especially
[2:08:23] this water.
[2:08:24] &gt;&gt; That's true.
[2:08:25] &gt;&gt; So season fade into another season.
[2:08:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:08:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:08:31] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:08:33] &gt;&gt; Are we together? In other words, you
[2:08:35] don't just change like this.
[2:08:37] &gt;&gt; No, no, no, no, no, no, no. If you very
[2:08:39] spiritual, you will begin to feel
[2:08:41] something is changing.
[2:08:42] &gt;&gt; And as it's changing, you are changing
[2:08:44] the corner.
[2:08:46] [Laughter]
[2:08:48] Hallelujah. Brother Brham says this. I
[2:08:51] know the devil is trying to fight you,
[2:08:52] but you will get it.
[2:08:53] &gt;&gt; The Bible say we notice before what?
[2:08:57] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham comes, watch some of
[2:08:59] his laws.
[2:09:01] &gt;&gt; When you see the trees doing what?
[2:09:04] &gt;&gt; Putting forth.
[2:09:05] &gt;&gt; He says, you know that what
[2:09:07] &gt;&gt; summer is
[2:09:08] &gt;&gt; springtime is a sign
[2:09:10] &gt;&gt; of the introduction of summer coming on.
[2:09:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:09:15] [Applause]
[2:09:18] So when you begin to see springtime, you
[2:09:20] already know summer is coming.
[2:09:24] [Laughter]
[2:09:26] &gt;&gt; He say that is a law. It's always what
[2:09:30] &gt;&gt; happens that way.
[2:09:33] &gt;&gt; Why is brother Brandon praying for you?
[2:09:36] And he tells you when you begin to feel
[2:09:38] good, praise the Lord.
[2:09:44] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[2:09:45] Brother Brandham say when your hand
[2:09:46] begin to move a little bit, what do you
[2:09:48] do?
[2:09:49] &gt;&gt; Why?
[2:09:52] &gt;&gt; Because it's not just going to be the
[2:09:54] finger
[2:09:55] &gt;&gt; after a while the hand.
[2:09:56] &gt;&gt; In other words, healing is coming.
[2:10:01] [Laughter]
[2:10:04] &gt;&gt; He says that is a law. He always does
[2:10:08] what?
[2:10:09] You don't have summer
[2:10:12] &gt;&gt; then about the time it gets winter then
[2:10:14] the leaves comes on. No,
[2:10:16] &gt;&gt; you have the leaf first
[2:10:19] &gt;&gt; because it's what?
[2:10:21] &gt;&gt; An introduction of his laws of water
[2:10:24] &gt;&gt; nature.
[2:10:24] &gt;&gt; That spring is doing what?
[2:10:27] &gt;&gt; He never fail. When you see the trees
[2:10:30] begin to get what
[2:10:31] &gt;&gt; tender
[2:10:32] &gt;&gt; around on the back and the little bird
[2:10:34] begin to swell, you know that it's a
[2:10:36] sign that spring is here is what
[2:10:39] &gt;&gt; coming in.
[2:10:40] &gt;&gt; So one season announces the next one.
[2:10:45] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:10:46] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says here he says and
[2:10:49] there shall be a fall and and there
[2:10:51] shall not be a fallout shelter that we
[2:10:54] shall need. There shall be a what? hand
[2:10:56] of God.
[2:10:57] &gt;&gt; For as I said at the beginning of the
[2:10:59] message, father as thy lift's life goes
[2:11:03] back to the root when he comes from and
[2:11:06] wait for what?
[2:11:07] &gt;&gt; Another season.
[2:11:08] &gt;&gt; We know that we are near what?
[2:11:10] &gt;&gt; Another season.
[2:11:11] &gt;&gt; We can feel the change of what?
[2:11:14] &gt;&gt; Atmosphere.
[2:11:14] &gt;&gt; Which atmosphere?
[2:11:16] &gt;&gt; Spiritual atmosphere.
[2:11:17] &gt;&gt; Not a natural atmosphere now, but a
[2:11:20] spiritual atmosphere. If you not, if you
[2:11:23] are spiritual enough, you can see even
[2:11:26] how a church is moving.
[2:11:28] &gt;&gt; You can feel the anointing is changing.
[2:11:32] &gt;&gt; You can feel that. No, no. The way we
[2:11:34] were in the hotel is not the way we are
[2:11:37] now. It is telling you a season is
[2:11:40] coming. There is a changes that is
[2:11:43] coming.
[2:11:48] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:11:50] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Watch the atmosphere.
[2:11:53] &gt;&gt; Feel the atmosphere. The atmosphere
[2:11:56] tells you something.
[2:12:00] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:12:01] &gt;&gt; Why is the devil so much on you?
[2:12:07] &gt;&gt; It looks like the more spiritual you
[2:12:09] get, the more the devil is multiplying.
[2:12:13] &gt;&gt; What is the devil after?
[2:12:16] &gt;&gt; Why is he multiplying the trouble?
[2:12:19] Because the devil sees something.
[2:12:27] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together.
[2:12:29] &gt;&gt; Why the struggle have increased?
[2:12:32] &gt;&gt; You thought when I consecrate myself
[2:12:35] then doors will be open. But the more
[2:12:38] you get deeper in God, the more the
[2:12:40] pressure is coming up. What is going on?
[2:12:47] You can focus on the symptom
[2:12:50] &gt;&gt; or you can focus on the right thing.
[2:12:53] &gt;&gt; But today we need to learn to focus on
[2:12:55] the right thing.
[2:12:57] [Applause]
[2:12:58] [Music]
[2:12:58] [Applause]
[2:13:02] &gt;&gt; Are we together? There is only one bird
[2:13:06] on the planet earth
[2:13:07] &gt;&gt; that love the storm.
[2:13:10] [Applause]
[2:13:16] The Bible say,
[2:13:18] &gt;&gt; the Bible say where the caucus is,
[2:13:22] &gt;&gt; who are you going to find
[2:13:24] &gt;&gt; in this church? The carcass is here.
[2:13:27] &gt;&gt; So who am I preaching to?
[2:13:31] &gt;&gt; Who am I preaching to?
[2:13:33] &gt;&gt; Who am I talking to?
[2:13:35] &gt;&gt; And there is only one bird that love the
[2:13:38] storm. When the storm is coming, the
[2:13:42] bird don't see storm.
[2:13:45] The the eagle sees the season. He said,
[2:13:50] "Come on. Come on." Because when he
[2:13:54] comes, the eagle takes the bed and he
[2:13:57] begin to sow.
[2:14:00] [Applause]
[2:14:03] [Music]
[2:14:05] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Are we together? Are we
[2:14:09] together?
[2:14:10] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:14:11] &gt;&gt; If the storm is not there,
[2:14:14] &gt;&gt; the eagle is working.
[2:14:16] &gt;&gt; The eagle is working.
[2:14:18] &gt;&gt; The eagle is working. The wigle is
[2:14:20] working. But the storm have energy.
[2:14:25] &gt;&gt; And when the storm come, the ego say,
[2:14:27] "It's my break time."
[2:14:29] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[2:14:30] &gt;&gt; The eagle pick up the storm and just sit
[2:14:33] like this. And the storm is guarding the

[2:14:39] [Applause]
[2:14:41] [Music]
[2:14:46] Brother,
[2:14:47] &gt;&gt; brother,
[2:14:48] &gt;&gt; my brother,
[2:14:50] &gt;&gt; my sister,
[2:14:51] &gt;&gt; you were built for your storm.
[2:14:54] [Applause]
[2:14:59] &gt;&gt; No matter how much the storm pushes you,
[2:15:02] remind the devil, you are taking me to
[2:15:05] my destiny. Keep pressing. Keep pushing.
[2:15:09] I'm getting where I'm supposed to go.
[2:15:13] [Applause]
[2:15:19] [Music]
[2:15:21] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:15:22] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:15:24] &gt;&gt; What are you looking at your problem?
[2:15:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:15:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:15:28] &gt;&gt; When you look at your problem, what do
[2:15:30] you see?
[2:15:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:15:32] &gt;&gt; Which caliber are you in? Hallelujah.
[2:15:35] &gt;&gt; If it's a crow, the crow hide.
[2:15:38] &gt;&gt; The hawk hide.
[2:15:39] &gt;&gt; Everybody run away.
[2:15:41] &gt;&gt; The ego sit and say, "Praise the Lord."
[2:15:44] &gt;&gt; Because these two things are going to
[2:15:46] get rest.
[2:15:48] &gt;&gt; There is something in you that use the
[2:15:51] negative energy to propel you toward the
[2:15:55] positive energy.
[2:15:57] [Applause]
[2:16:01] That's why That's why God never take
[2:16:05] trials from your life.
[2:16:07] [Applause]
[2:16:11] &gt;&gt; When Jesus saw his trial,
[2:16:14] &gt;&gt; he wanted to dodge. God said, "Remember
[2:16:17] who you are."
[2:16:18] &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "Father, not my will.
[2:16:21] &gt;&gt; Bring it on." When he took the trial, he
[2:16:24] went to see Abraham
[2:16:26] &gt;&gt; and he went to hell and did we took the
[2:16:30] trial of Jesus to bring the full
[2:16:33] redemption.
[2:16:34] [Applause]
[2:16:38] &gt;&gt; That's why the Bible say for the joy
[2:16:41] that was set before
[2:16:43] &gt;&gt; he despised the cross.
[2:16:45] &gt;&gt; He look at the cross he say oh no
[2:16:46] problem. Come on.
[2:16:48] &gt;&gt; Come on. I've been too low here working
[2:16:51] working. Come on. And suddenly poop. Yes
[2:16:53] sir.
[2:16:54] &gt;&gt; Ego say we praise the Lord.
[2:16:57] &gt;&gt; Now the ego doesn't work.
[2:16:59] &gt;&gt; He's sorry.
[2:17:00] &gt;&gt; Stretch your feet.
[2:17:03] &gt;&gt; He s.
[2:17:05] &gt;&gt; In other words, in the trial, I don't
[2:17:08] pray anymore.
[2:17:10] [Music]
[2:17:11] &gt;&gt; I was praying before the trial.
[2:17:14] &gt;&gt; Now I don't pray.
[2:17:17] &gt;&gt; Take me. I will show you where we are. I
[2:17:19] was already prayed up. Now I can go
[2:17:22] through.
[2:17:26] [Applause]
[2:17:29] &gt;&gt; Listen to me, my friend.
[2:17:31] &gt;&gt; Jesus prayed in Gethsemane.
[2:17:34] &gt;&gt; Did you see Jesus praying at the cross?
[2:17:37] [Applause]
[2:17:42] &gt;&gt; When Jesus came down
[2:17:44] &gt;&gt; and he said, "Who do you look for?"
[2:17:46] &gt;&gt; Did you see him saying who? No,
[2:17:49] &gt;&gt; the people themselves went back
[2:17:52] &gt;&gt; when they cut the servant ear.
[2:17:54] &gt;&gt; Did you see Jesus saying in the name of
[2:17:57] Jesus Christ,
[2:17:58] &gt;&gt; he just pick up and put because he was
[2:18:00] already charged. He's now
[2:18:04] there is no more time. I'm already in
[2:18:06] trial. I don't have time to fast
[2:18:11] &gt;&gt; because he say he's the present help
[2:18:14] &gt;&gt; in the time of trouble. Let God be God.
[2:18:22] &gt;&gt; Don't help God.
[2:18:29] &gt;&gt; I hope you are together.
[2:18:30] &gt;&gt; Your trial is is gasoline.
[2:18:33] &gt;&gt; It's fuel.
[2:18:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:18:38] &gt;&gt; Why should I panic anymore? It's already
[2:18:40] happening.
[2:18:43] That's the time you speak the word.
[2:18:49] &gt;&gt; Not pray. Speak the word.
[2:18:54] &gt;&gt; Joshua was in the middle of the battle.
[2:18:57] He didn't have time to say wait,
[2:19:00] &gt;&gt; wait two days he let me fast.
[2:19:02] &gt;&gt; He looked left and right. He said, "You
[2:19:04] know what? I'm on my post of duty.
[2:19:07] &gt;&gt; Sun, stop right there.
[2:19:09] Moon stop right there. He didn't even
[2:19:12] use the name of Jesus
[2:19:14] [Applause]
[2:19:18] &gt;&gt; because Joshua means Yeshua. It is the
[2:19:22] very name of Jesus
[2:19:26] [Applause]
[2:19:28] &gt;&gt; and you are Mrs. Jesus.
[2:19:30] [Applause]
[2:19:32] &gt;&gt; When the trial is coming,
[2:19:36] &gt;&gt; remember who you are. Let go.
[2:19:40] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God.
[2:19:44] &gt;&gt; Focus on the right thing.
[2:19:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:19:49] &gt;&gt; Jesus,
[2:19:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:19:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:20:00] &gt;&gt; Why is it so dark now?
[2:20:03] &gt;&gt; Why does it look like things are I'm
[2:20:05] almost about to collapse? Yes,
[2:20:07] &gt;&gt; I feel like I'm about to blow up.
[2:20:10] &gt;&gt; What is going on?
[2:20:13] &gt;&gt; How do you call that blow up? It
[2:20:15] &gt;&gt; in other words, if God doesn't intervene
[2:20:17] now, I'm done.
[2:20:20] &gt;&gt; Really?
[2:20:21] &gt;&gt; Let me show you the explanation of that.
[2:20:25] &gt;&gt; William Marion Brham,
[2:20:27] &gt;&gt; we see what
[2:20:28] &gt;&gt; darkness
[2:20:29] &gt;&gt; doing what
[2:20:30] &gt;&gt; gathering. Now,
[2:20:31] &gt;&gt; what is it? It is light pressing
[2:20:35] &gt;&gt; against the darkness.
[2:20:40] [Applause]
[2:20:47] &gt;&gt; Who's pressing?
[2:20:49] &gt;&gt; Who's pressing?
[2:20:51] &gt;&gt; According to you, you thought the devil
[2:20:52] is pressing you.
[2:20:54] &gt;&gt; No, it is the God that you listen to.
[2:20:57] Every Wednesday and Sunday,
[2:21:00] &gt;&gt; his word is pressing the devil.
[2:21:04] [Music]
[2:21:07] [Applause]
[2:21:13] &gt;&gt; The Bible say brother Brandham say what
[2:21:15] is it's what
[2:21:17] &gt;&gt; doing what?
[2:21:19] &gt;&gt; One has to do what?
[2:21:22] &gt;&gt; All the quing things that has been what?
[2:21:24] &gt;&gt; Running through the night. When the sun
[2:21:26] do what?
[2:21:29] &gt;&gt; All the demon that have been running in
[2:21:31] your life,
[2:21:33] &gt;&gt; God send an anointed message
[2:21:36] &gt;&gt; and that message is pressing them.
[2:21:39] &gt;&gt; Pressing them,
[2:21:40] &gt;&gt; pressing them and they don't want to go.
[2:21:46] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Are we together?
[2:21:48] Brother say they take what
[2:21:52] &gt;&gt; when the light shine
[2:21:53] &gt;&gt; night and what? and dark.
[2:21:55] &gt;&gt; Night and light cannot exist in the same
[2:21:58] what?
[2:22:02] &gt;&gt; Light and darkness cannot exist where
[2:22:06] &gt;&gt; the same building.
[2:22:07] &gt;&gt; Do you know that you a building?
[2:22:10] &gt;&gt; Do you know that you are a building?
[2:22:14] &gt;&gt; You a temple. Do you know that?
[2:22:16] &gt;&gt; So light and darkness cannot stay in my
[2:22:19] temple.
[2:22:22] One must give away.
[2:22:26] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:22:28] &gt;&gt; Light and darkness cannot exist in my
[2:22:31] house
[2:22:33] &gt;&gt; because that house God gave it to me.
[2:22:38] &gt;&gt; I'm not talking about your body. Your
[2:22:40] house a home. We cannot have two powers
[2:22:46] [Applause]
[2:22:50] &gt;&gt; in your apartment.
[2:22:52] &gt;&gt; You cannot have two powers.
[2:22:59] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:23:01] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham say light and dark
[2:23:04] cannot exist where
[2:23:05] &gt;&gt; in the same building. It is either water
[2:23:08] &gt;&gt; or it's water.
[2:23:10] &gt;&gt; And light is so much more powerful than
[2:23:13] darkness.
[2:23:17] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:23:18] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Are we together? He
[2:23:21] says, "So is Christ
[2:23:24] &gt;&gt; how
[2:23:25] &gt;&gt; so much more powerful
[2:23:26] &gt;&gt; than what?
[2:23:27] &gt;&gt; All the enemies of the world."
[2:23:29] &gt;&gt; How many enemies?
[2:23:31] &gt;&gt; Where is Christed?
[2:23:34] Where is Jesus Christ at?
[2:23:36] &gt;&gt; So your Christ is more powerful than
[2:23:38] what?
[2:23:43] He's more powerful than your depression,
[2:23:46] &gt;&gt; than your high blood pressure, than your
[2:23:49] sugar,
[2:23:51] &gt;&gt; than your anemia,
[2:23:53] &gt;&gt; your eye problem, your crust is greater.
[2:23:57] [Applause]
[2:24:04] &gt;&gt; Bear with me my friend. Brother Brandham
[2:24:06] said, now we are taught by what?
[2:24:08] scientists
[2:24:09] &gt;&gt; that as the light begin to do what?
[2:24:12] &gt;&gt; Come.
[2:24:12] &gt;&gt; It does what?
[2:24:13] &gt;&gt; Denses the darkness.
[2:24:15] &gt;&gt; And the darkness do what?
[2:24:17] &gt;&gt; Gathers all of its host together
[2:24:19] &gt;&gt; to do what?
[2:24:20] &gt;&gt; Fight against the light.
[2:24:21] &gt;&gt; But the light will do what?
[2:24:22] &gt;&gt; Prevails
[2:24:23] &gt;&gt; and what?
[2:24:24] &gt;&gt; And comes on.
[2:24:25] &gt;&gt; So why is it darkness in your life?
[2:24:28] &gt;&gt; It is not that Satan is overwhelming
[2:24:30] you.
[2:24:31] &gt;&gt; It is the light of God is pressing
[2:24:34] Satan.
[2:24:37] [Applause]
[2:24:42] Are we together?
[2:24:43] &gt;&gt; And this happened before the day come.
[2:24:52] &gt;&gt; You didn't get me my friend.
[2:24:54] &gt;&gt; You didn't get me my friend. Listen to
[2:24:56] this my friend. The Bible brother say
[2:25:00] what makes it dark when days.
[2:25:06] What make what?
[2:25:08] &gt;&gt; Dark before a day.
[2:25:09] &gt;&gt; Dark when
[2:25:11] &gt;&gt; before day.
[2:25:12] &gt;&gt; So when you see too much darkness, what
[2:25:14] is behind it?
[2:25:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:25:18] &gt;&gt; When you see too much darkness, the
[2:25:20] devil is on me. Maybe I did something
[2:25:22] wrong. Satan is on.
[2:25:25] It's a change of season.
[2:25:27] &gt;&gt; It's a change of days.
[2:25:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[2:25:36] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham say what makes it dark
[2:25:38] when
[2:25:39] &gt;&gt; before a day
[2:25:40] &gt;&gt; it is what
[2:25:41] &gt;&gt; the darkest before a day.
[2:25:44] &gt;&gt; Where are you in your life?
[2:25:46] &gt;&gt; Is it too dark?
[2:25:48] &gt;&gt; Does it feel like it's so dark?
[2:25:50] &gt;&gt; There is a day there.
[2:25:53] &gt;&gt; If you don't know how to read the
[2:25:55] season,
[2:25:56] &gt;&gt; you will miss the season.
[2:25:57] &gt;&gt; You will focus so much on the dot.
[2:26:05] You will focus so much on the darkness,
[2:26:07] not seeing that God is compressing
[2:26:11] &gt;&gt; the darkness because he's about to
[2:26:13] &gt;&gt; rise.
[2:26:19] &gt;&gt; My friend, he says we are told by who?
[2:26:22] &gt;&gt; Scientists
[2:26:22] &gt;&gt; that it's the light doing what?
[2:26:25] &gt;&gt; Pressing
[2:26:25] &gt;&gt; and doing what?
[2:26:26] &gt;&gt; Coming on
[2:26:27] &gt;&gt; and doing what?
[2:26:28] &gt;&gt; Moving down. The sun is coming around
[2:26:30] water
[2:26:30] &gt;&gt; around the world.
[2:26:31] &gt;&gt; It's the light doing what?
[2:26:33] &gt;&gt; It's pressing the darkness.
[2:26:34] &gt;&gt; She's making what?
[2:26:35] &gt;&gt; Her last strike.
[2:26:36] &gt;&gt; She can't stand no more.
[2:26:38] &gt;&gt; Darkness can never stand. When
[2:26:41] &gt;&gt; in the presence of light,
[2:26:42] &gt;&gt; he cannot do it. Light is how
[2:26:45] &gt;&gt; 10 million times stronger than darkness.
[2:26:48] &gt;&gt; So light and darkness cannot dwell
[2:26:50] together.
[2:26:51] &gt;&gt; And when light begin to do what?
[2:26:53] &gt;&gt; Rise.
[2:26:54] &gt;&gt; Darkness do what?
[2:26:55] &gt;&gt; Settle.
[2:26:56] &gt;&gt; And what?
[2:26:57] &gt;&gt; And gets there. It's pressing it how
[2:26:59] &gt;&gt; together.
[2:27:00] &gt;&gt; So when you see things not working too
[2:27:02] good and it's getting worse.
[2:27:05] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:27:08] [Applause]
[2:27:12] &gt;&gt; There is a new day coming.
[2:27:15] &gt;&gt; There is a new day approaching. That's
[2:27:18] why it's getting dark.
[2:27:21] &gt;&gt; Because something is coming.
[2:27:23] Instead of focusing on the darkness,
[2:27:26] begin to prepare for the season.
[2:27:30] [Applause]
[2:27:34] &gt;&gt; And I thank God sister Joanne was
[2:27:36] dancing here.
[2:27:38] [Applause]
[2:27:49] Some of you are in a better health than
[2:27:52] her. You ashamed to dance. But if you
[2:27:56] recognize the time, you will know what
[2:27:59] to do. I am dancing because my day is
[2:28:03] coming. A new day is approaching. Press
[2:28:06] on.
[2:28:09] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Are we together? Are we
[2:28:13] together?
[2:28:14] &gt;&gt; Look outside. Why is this so bad? Why is
[2:28:18] the devil so bad? Why is sodomite so
[2:28:22] bad? Why is tattoo everywhere? A day is
[2:28:25] approaching. The rapture is approaching.
[2:28:28] So the the light is compressing the
[2:28:31] darkness.
[2:28:35] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Are we together?
[2:28:38] Focusing on the right thing in the
[2:28:40] season. Amen.
[2:28:42] [Applause]
[2:28:44] [Music]
[2:28:47] &gt;&gt; Father, help me.
[2:28:48] &gt;&gt; Let's go to the Bible.
[2:28:50] &gt;&gt; Take Jeremiah 27.
[2:28:53] &gt;&gt; Oh, God.
[2:28:55] [Music]
[2:29:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:29:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:29:11] Look your conversation
[2:29:13] &gt;&gt; what you talk about
[2:29:15] &gt;&gt; it's what has been preoccupying your
[2:29:17] mind
[2:29:20] &gt;&gt; all your conversation are complaint
[2:29:25] [Music]
[2:29:29] &gt;&gt; and according to you he appear like the
[2:29:31] pastor is good
[2:29:33] &gt;&gt; because you always come to the pastor
[2:29:35] &gt;&gt; and the pastor is the one telling you
[2:29:37] stuff to do. So what do I go myself
[2:29:39] through
[2:29:40] &gt;&gt; because I learn not to complain.
[2:29:44] &gt;&gt; It doesn't change anything
[2:29:47] &gt;&gt; because there are many time I seen this
[2:29:50] happen and God deliver me. This happened
[2:29:52] God deliver this happen God. It happened
[2:29:54] so many times. So I must reach a point
[2:29:58] that somebody is delivering me.
[2:30:01] [Applause]
[2:30:04] Yes sir.
[2:30:05] &gt;&gt; I went through so many problem and I
[2:30:08] came out of it.
[2:30:09] &gt;&gt; Who is this a circumcised Philistine?
[2:30:13] &gt;&gt; He delivered me from the lion. He
[2:30:15] delivered me from the bear. So what
[2:30:17] about this?
[2:30:18] [Applause]
[2:30:28] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:30:30] &gt;&gt; Let's go to Jeremiah 27.
[2:30:34] My friend, help me move.
[2:30:37] &gt;&gt; I reduced the material and put only one
[2:30:40] sheet
[2:30:41] &gt;&gt; and now we are right here.
[2:30:46] &gt;&gt; I removed the material on the other
[2:30:47] sheet. I kept it for another day. We are
[2:30:49] have barely half a day. Let's go to 27.
[2:30:53] Jeremiah 27.
[2:30:55] &gt;&gt; If you dare, you can say amen.
[2:30:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:30:59] &gt;&gt; Verse four. If you dare, you can say
[2:31:01] amen. Amen.
[2:31:02] &gt;&gt; This is Jeremiah giving the word of the
[2:31:04] Lord and command to them. Buckle up, my
[2:31:07] friend. And then I'm going to move a
[2:31:09] little bit. Then after that, we turn
[2:31:11] toward the airport. Amen.
[2:31:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:31:14] &gt;&gt; I know we got a word of baptism. Hang
[2:31:16] on.
[2:31:17] &gt;&gt; You need to go home with something.
[2:31:19] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:31:20] &gt;&gt; And command them to say to their master,
[2:31:24] say what?
[2:31:26] &gt;&gt; Thus sayith the Lord of hosts,
[2:31:27] &gt;&gt; the God of what? Israel
[2:31:29] &gt;&gt; that shall say to your master. See, so
[2:31:31] who's talking?
[2:31:33] &gt;&gt; God who? The Lord of Israel.
[2:31:36] &gt;&gt; Follow me carefully.
[2:31:38] &gt;&gt; I have made the earth the man and the
[2:31:42] beast that are that are upon the ground
[2:31:45] &gt;&gt; by my what?
[2:31:46] &gt;&gt; Great power
[2:31:47] &gt;&gt; and by my what
[2:31:48] &gt;&gt; outstretched arm
[2:31:49] &gt;&gt; and I have given it to whom
[2:31:52] &gt;&gt; it seems what
[2:31:53] &gt;&gt; meet unto me. In other words, God is
[2:31:55] telling the nation, I am the God who
[2:31:57] created everything.
[2:31:59] &gt;&gt; And when I created everything, I'm
[2:32:01] sovereign
[2:32:02] &gt;&gt; by my sovereignty uh by my sovereignty,

[2:32:22] preacher, this one a musician, this one
[2:32:24] will sit on the pews to say amen. It is
[2:32:26] God that chose that.
[2:32:30] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:32:31] &gt;&gt; You can cry all you want. It's chosen by
[2:32:33] predestination.

[2:32:38] &gt;&gt; than trying to be in somebody else
[2:32:40] party.

[2:32:51] &gt;&gt; I go to sleep around 3:00 and I'm awake
[2:32:53] and I'm here preaching.
[2:33:01] &gt;&gt; But how do I do that?
[2:33:03] &gt;&gt; Because I didn't choose myself.
[2:33:05] &gt;&gt; That's why I have the power to do it.
[2:33:08] &gt;&gt; If you try, you will collapse.
[2:33:14] Are we together?
[2:33:15] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:33:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.

[2:33:42] &gt;&gt; who created everything
[2:33:44] &gt;&gt; who dispatched as I want I have decided
[2:33:48] that from this time on
[2:33:50] &gt;&gt; from this season
[2:33:52] &gt;&gt; every one of you
[2:33:54] &gt;&gt; I have given you to Nebuchadnezzar.
[2:33:58] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[2:33:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.

[2:34:31] &gt;&gt; No.
[2:34:31] &gt;&gt; Is he an Israelite?
[2:34:32] &gt;&gt; No. He's a worshshiper of Adam.
[2:34:36] &gt;&gt; And instead of God taking the kingdom
[2:34:38] and giving to the king of Israel, God
[2:34:41] went to a gentile hidden
[2:34:43] &gt;&gt; and say me God
[2:34:45] &gt;&gt; I have given everything to
[2:34:47] Nebuchadnezzar.

[2:35:06] season.
[2:35:07] &gt;&gt; Your blessing may now be, in other
[2:35:10] words, God is shifting from Israel
[2:35:14] &gt;&gt; to Babylon.
[2:35:15] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Yes, sir.
[2:35:17] &gt;&gt; If you remain in Israel,
[2:35:20] &gt;&gt; God is no longer there.
[2:35:25] [Applause]
[2:35:29] I can't move my friend.

[2:35:33] &gt;&gt; Ah, Sister Teresa, say amen.
[2:35:35] &gt;&gt; Let's go, my friend. He says, "And now
[2:35:38] have I what?"
[2:35:39] &gt;&gt; Given all these lands
[2:35:40] &gt;&gt; to who?
[2:35:40] &gt;&gt; Into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar,
[2:35:42] &gt;&gt; the what?
[2:35:43] &gt;&gt; The king of Babylon.
[2:35:44] &gt;&gt; The king of what?
[2:35:45] &gt;&gt; Babylon.
[2:35:47] &gt;&gt; So to you when they say king of Babylon,
[2:35:51] &gt;&gt; but let me look at this king of Babylon.
[2:35:53] The king of Babylon. Kama. What?

[2:35:58] &gt;&gt; The servant of who?
[2:36:00] &gt;&gt; Who preached to him?
[2:36:02] &gt;&gt; Who converted him?
[2:36:05] &gt;&gt; But God is calling him what?
[2:36:10] &gt;&gt; So when you look at Nebuchadnezzar, who
[2:36:12] do you see?
[2:36:14] &gt;&gt; A hidden or a servant of God?
[2:36:20] &gt;&gt; If not, we won't finish this sermon. a
[2:36:23] heathen or a servant of God.
[2:36:26] &gt;&gt; Slow down. Let me let me let me bring a
[2:36:29] towok.
[2:36:30] &gt;&gt; So that will blow you very good and blow
[2:36:33] the devil that will cause problem. Keep
[2:36:35] your finger right there. Okay. Go to
[2:36:38] Ezekiel 9. Uh Ezekiel 29.
[2:36:42] &gt;&gt; Father help me.
[2:36:43] &gt;&gt; If you can go quickly so we can uh let
[2:36:46] you go home. Ezekiel 29.
[2:36:56] Brother Tony, I don't know how you
[2:36:57] preach here and finish your sermon.
[2:37:06] &gt;&gt; Ezekiel 29 verse 17. If you there you
[2:37:09] can say amen.
[2:37:11] The Bible say and it came to pass in the
[2:37:13] seventh and 20th year in the first month
[2:37:17] in the first day of the month the word
[2:37:19] of the Lord came to me saying what
[2:37:21] &gt;&gt; son of man
[2:37:23] &gt;&gt; Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon caused
[2:37:26] his army to serve a great service
[2:37:30] &gt;&gt; against Tyrus.
[2:37:32] Every head that was made bald, every
[2:37:35] shoulder was peeled. Yet he had no
[2:37:38] wages.
[2:37:41] God is saying they didn't pay in
[2:37:43] Nebuchadnezzar.
[2:37:45] &gt;&gt; He did service. They didn't pay him.
[2:37:49] &gt;&gt; He has no wages.
[2:37:50] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:37:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:37:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:37:52] &gt;&gt; Nor his army for Tus for the service
[2:37:57] that he had served against it.
[2:38:00] &gt;&gt; So God is coming. He say Nebuchadnezzar
[2:38:03] did some work there. You didn't give him
[2:38:05] his paycheck.
[2:38:07] M
[2:38:09] &gt;&gt; is my Bible different than yours?
[2:38:12] &gt;&gt; Verse 19. Therefore, thus sayith the
[2:38:15] Lord.
[2:38:17] &gt;&gt; Behold, I will give the land of what?
[2:38:20] &gt;&gt; Egypt.
[2:38:20] &gt;&gt; To who?
[2:38:21] &gt;&gt; Nebuchadnezzar,
[2:38:22] &gt;&gt; king of Babylon, and he shall take her
[2:38:24] multitude and take what?
[2:38:26] &gt;&gt; Her spoil.
[2:38:27] &gt;&gt; And take what?
[2:38:28] &gt;&gt; Her praise.
[2:38:28] &gt;&gt; And it shall be the wage for his army.
[2:38:31] Amen.
[2:38:33] &gt;&gt; God is bringing the paycheck
[2:38:36] &gt;&gt; to Nebuchadnezzar.
[2:38:39] &gt;&gt; Am I reading a different Bible?
[2:38:42] &gt;&gt; Jump to verse 20. I have given him what?
[2:38:45] &gt;&gt; The land of Egypt
[2:38:47] &gt;&gt; for his labor.
[2:38:50] &gt;&gt; Wherewith he served
[2:38:52] &gt;&gt; against it because they wrote it for the
[2:38:57] devil.
[2:38:58] &gt;&gt; For me.
[2:38:58] &gt;&gt; They did the job for who?
[2:39:00] &gt;&gt; For me. So Nebuchadnezzar was working
[2:39:02] for who
[2:39:03] &gt;&gt; and God is coming to pay him.
[2:39:09] &gt;&gt; Let's go back to Jeremiah 29. Who did
[2:39:12] the work for God?
[2:39:15] &gt;&gt; Nebuchadnezzar. And God is coming to pay
[2:39:18] who?
[2:39:18] &gt;&gt; God is even coming. He say there were
[2:39:22] there were a shift a shift
[2:39:24] Nebuchadnezzar worked there.
[2:39:26] &gt;&gt; Did you pay him?
[2:39:27] &gt;&gt; No.
[2:39:28] &gt;&gt; Oh no no no we didn't pay him. He said
[2:39:29] what?
[2:39:30] He worked for me. You know what? Ah,
[2:39:33] give him Egypt.
[2:39:34] &gt;&gt; So you see Nebuchadnezzar going to Egypt
[2:39:37] and overcoming Egypt. You say, "My, that
[2:39:40] is a powerful king." He's not powerful.
[2:39:43] All is coming from heaven.
[2:39:45] [Applause]
[2:39:48] &gt;&gt; And why is Nebuchadnezzar getting Egypt?
[2:39:51] God is giving him a salary. If God can
[2:39:55] give a salary to a hidden king
[2:39:59] &gt;&gt; for the service he done for you.
[2:40:02] &gt;&gt; What about you?
[2:40:06] [Applause]
[2:40:06] [Music]
[2:40:08] [Applause]
[2:40:09] &gt;&gt; I hope you are listening to me. Musician
[2:40:12] &gt;&gt; for the service you done for God.
[2:40:16] &gt;&gt; Technician. You who say amen.
[2:40:19] &gt;&gt; For the service you done for God.
[2:40:22] What do you think God will do?
[2:40:27] [Applause]
[2:40:32] &gt;&gt; He's rewarding a servant.
[2:40:35] &gt;&gt; But you are not servant. You are
[2:40:38] brother.
[2:40:39] [Applause]
[2:40:50] &gt;&gt; Now from today your perspective about
[2:40:52] Nebuchadnezzar change.
[2:40:55] &gt;&gt; So when you see Nebuchadnezzar coming to
[2:40:57] take Israel,
[2:40:59] &gt;&gt; what do you see?
[2:41:01] &gt;&gt; A disaster
[2:41:03] &gt;&gt; or it's a storm. It's a storm that is
[2:41:06] coming to pick you up
[2:41:08] &gt;&gt; because your blessing goes with that
[2:41:09] storm.
[2:41:13] [Applause]

[2:41:43] &gt;&gt; The king of Babylon. My servant.
[2:41:46] Jeremiah 27:6.
[2:41:48] My servant. And the beast of water.
[2:41:50] &gt;&gt; The field.
[2:41:51] &gt;&gt; Have I given him also to do what?
[2:41:53] &gt;&gt; Serve him.
[2:41:54] &gt;&gt; To what?
[2:41:57] &gt;&gt; Serve.
[2:41:58] &gt;&gt; To serve who?
[2:42:02] So who's subduing people
[2:42:04] &gt;&gt; to serve Nebuchadnezzar?
[2:42:08] &gt;&gt; Wait, wait for what is coming next.

[2:42:38] &gt;&gt; the son of Nebuchadnezzar and the great

[2:43:45] &gt;&gt; Serve themselves of him.
[2:43:47] &gt;&gt; Verse eight. And it shall come to pass
[2:43:50] that the nation and the kingdom which
[2:43:54] shall not serve the same Nebuchadnezzar,

[2:43:58] &gt;&gt; Babylon.
[2:43:59] &gt;&gt; And will not put their neck
[2:44:03] &gt;&gt; under the yoke of the king of Babylon.
[2:44:06] That nation will what?
[2:44:08] &gt;&gt; Punish.
[2:44:08] &gt;&gt; Who's going to punish the nation?
[2:44:10] &gt;&gt; God.
[2:44:13] So if you living in that time,
[2:44:16] &gt;&gt; where should you go?
[2:44:21] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. Now you afraid. Repeat the Bible.
[2:44:24] If you

[2:44:31] &gt;&gt; Is Babylon a good thing?
[2:44:33] &gt;&gt; It's a storm,
[2:44:34] &gt;&gt; but you need it.
[2:44:38] &gt;&gt; You need it.
[2:44:41] In other words, God is telling Israel,
[2:44:44] don't look at the storm
[2:44:46] &gt;&gt; of Babylon as a storm.
[2:44:49] &gt;&gt; The storm of Nebuchadnezzar is my
[2:44:52] servant.
[2:44:56] &gt;&gt; Ride under him.
[2:44:58] &gt;&gt; Ride on him.
[2:45:01] &gt;&gt; Where are we at?
[2:45:03] &gt;&gt; Eight.
[2:45:03] &gt;&gt; Eight. My friend, he says every nation,
[2:45:06] the king of Babylon, that nation will
[2:45:08] not do what? punish,
[2:45:09] &gt;&gt; says who?
[2:45:10] &gt;&gt; The Lord.
[2:45:12] &gt;&gt; With what?
[2:45:12] &gt;&gt; The sword
[2:45:13] &gt;&gt; and what?
[2:45:14] &gt;&gt; With the famine
[2:45:15] &gt;&gt; and with what?
[2:45:16] &gt;&gt; With pestilence.
[2:45:16] &gt;&gt; Until I have consumed them by his hand.
[2:45:21] &gt;&gt; In other words, if you refuse to get
[2:45:22] under Babylon, God himself come
[2:45:26] &gt;&gt; and kill you
[2:45:28] &gt;&gt; either by sword,
[2:45:30] &gt;&gt; either by famine or by sending disease.
[2:45:33] &gt;&gt; So where is safety now?
[2:45:38] What is the name of your storm?
[2:45:41] &gt;&gt; Nebuchadnezzar.
[2:45:44] &gt;&gt; Is it really Nebuchadnezzar?
[2:45:48] &gt;&gt; So, the anointing is on the storm.
[2:45:52] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:45:53] &gt;&gt; The anointing of God is on the storm.
[2:45:57] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[2:45:57] &gt;&gt; And God is saying, put your neck in that
[2:45:59] storm.
[2:46:00] &gt;&gt; Don't run away from it. Put it.

[2:47:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:47:26] &gt;&gt; Here's a season there.
[2:47:28] &gt;&gt; Let's go to Jeremiah 29.
[2:47:30] &gt;&gt; Beautiful.
[2:47:32] If I attended my friend, prepare for
[2:47:34] landing.
[2:47:36] &gt;&gt; If you dare, you can say amen.
[2:47:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:47:39] &gt;&gt; Lord have mercy on me. Amen.
[2:47:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Verse 29. Verse one. Now
[2:47:45] these are the words of what?
[2:47:46] &gt;&gt; The letter
[2:47:47] &gt;&gt; of who?
[2:47:48] &gt;&gt; That Jeremiah the
[2:47:49] &gt;&gt; prophet sent to who? From what?
[2:47:50] &gt;&gt; Jerusalem.
[2:47:51] &gt;&gt; To do to what?
[2:47:52] &gt;&gt; To the residue of the elders which were
[2:47:54] carried away captives.
[2:47:55] &gt;&gt; Ah the elder that were carried away.
[2:47:57] How?
[2:47:58] &gt;&gt; Captives.
[2:48:00] Mhm.
[2:48:01] &gt;&gt; When you carry the way
[2:48:03] &gt;&gt; was there your own will?
[2:48:06] &gt;&gt; So the only way you can get where God
[2:48:09] want you to go somewhere
[2:48:11] &gt;&gt; sometime they got to take you against
[2:48:12] your will.
[2:48:15] &gt;&gt; If not Joseph won't go.
[2:48:20] &gt;&gt; So they must get you captive.
[2:48:24] &gt;&gt; Captive toward Babylon.
[2:48:29] But look at the mystery behind Babylon.
[2:48:32] It was God that was there.
[2:48:36] &gt;&gt; That's why Jeremiah sent the letter
[2:48:38] &gt;&gt; to those who areware.
[2:48:40] &gt;&gt; Those that are already under
[2:48:42] Nebuchadnezzar.
[2:48:44] &gt;&gt; Because those that were already under
[2:48:46] Nebuchadnezzar,
[2:48:48] &gt;&gt; amen, were still confused.
[2:48:50] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:48:52] &gt;&gt; They were still in Babylon and they are
[2:48:54] looking at uh at Canaan.
[2:48:56] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. So their mentality is
[2:48:59] &gt;&gt; the day I'm going to go to Kenan.
[2:49:01] &gt;&gt; The day I'm going to go to Kenan.
[2:49:03] &gt;&gt; The day I'm going to go to Canaan. I
[2:49:05] can't wait to go to Kenan.
[2:49:07] &gt;&gt; Let's wait. They say it's 2 years. They
[2:49:09] say it's 3 years. Why are you waiting?
[2:49:11] I'm not waiting. I'm waiting for the
[2:49:13] rapture. Hey, sorry. I'm waiting for the
[2:49:15] day to go to to Canaan
[2:49:19] &gt;&gt; because we are in Babylon.
[2:49:21] &gt;&gt; We need to go back to Canaan. Thank you.
[2:49:25] &gt;&gt; We are in modern Babylon. We need to go
[2:49:28] back to Canaan.
[2:49:29] &gt;&gt; I have my friend I have like 10 quotes
[2:49:31] that I can line you up one two three
[2:49:33] four if I'm not mistaken.
[2:49:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:49:37] &gt;&gt; So the one that are in Babylon they
[2:49:40] don't understand that there is a season
[2:49:44] &gt;&gt; a season of Nebuchadnezzar
[2:49:46] his son and his great. So God give them
[2:49:50] three rain
[2:49:52] &gt;&gt; with his anointing there.
[2:49:54] &gt;&gt; Exactly right.
[2:49:56] &gt;&gt; I don't know if we together,
[2:49:57] &gt;&gt; but when they are sitting under the
[2:50:00] anointing,
[2:50:01] &gt;&gt; they don't see the anointing.
[2:50:03] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:50:06] &gt;&gt; They are seeing Canaan
[2:50:09] &gt;&gt; until in the book of Psalm
[2:50:12] &gt;&gt; they told them, "Hey, you
[2:50:15] &gt;&gt; we see you with uh brother Zach. We see
[2:50:18] you with a guitar.
[2:50:20] &gt;&gt; Can you play to us
[2:50:22] &gt;&gt; those song
[2:50:24] &gt;&gt; of
[2:50:24] &gt;&gt; Zion?
[2:50:29] &gt;&gt; Go ahead and sing.
[2:50:31] &gt;&gt; And do you know what they answer?
[2:50:33] &gt;&gt; Because of the overwhelming situation.
[2:50:37] &gt;&gt; They say no, I'm not in the position to
[2:50:40] sing.
[2:50:42] &gt;&gt; How can I sing the song of water
[2:50:45] &gt;&gt; in a water?
[2:50:47] Where was God?
[2:50:54] &gt;&gt; Worship the Lord. I'm going through a
[2:50:56] trial.
[2:50:58] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. I'm going through a
[2:51:00] problem.
[2:51:01] [Applause]
[2:51:03] &gt;&gt; Be happy. My husband left me.
[2:51:06] &gt;&gt; My wife left me.
[2:51:08] &gt;&gt; Ah, my children are not serving the
[2:51:09] Lord.
[2:51:10] &gt;&gt; No. No. No. In that strange land,
[2:51:14] &gt;&gt; in that bad situation,
[2:51:20] &gt;&gt; you will miss your season.
[2:51:26] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:51:28] &gt;&gt; Are we together? So Jeremiah send
[2:51:31] letter.
[2:51:32] &gt;&gt; He say you over there.
[2:51:35] &gt;&gt; What are you doing?
[2:51:37] &gt;&gt; Nothing.
[2:51:38] &gt;&gt; Hh.
[2:51:43] Doing what? Nothing.
[2:51:44] &gt;&gt; Why?
[2:51:46] &gt;&gt; We are waiting to go back to Zion.
[2:51:50] &gt;&gt; To go where?
[2:51:54] &gt;&gt; Who told you you are leaving now?
[2:51:58] &gt;&gt; Who told you you are living now?
[2:52:01] &gt;&gt; So, so, so why do you leave?
[2:52:03] &gt;&gt; No, we are renting uh and motel here.
[2:52:10] motel and what? No, no, no. We ended up
[2:52:13] uh uh uh uh uh uh renting a land that
[2:52:17] all of us are living in the camp
[2:52:19] together to keep uh us together.
[2:52:23] &gt;&gt; So that's why we are waiting because we
[2:52:25] need to go back. This is not our home.
[2:52:30] [Music]
[2:52:32] &gt;&gt; The anointing struck Jeremiah.
[2:52:35] &gt;&gt; Jeremiah said, "Bring bring me the pen.
[2:52:37] Bring me the pen. Let me write them a
[2:52:39] letter.
[2:52:40] &gt;&gt; As a major prophet,
[2:52:43] &gt;&gt; as the mouth of God,
[2:52:45] &gt;&gt; let me tell them what to do in Babylon.
[2:52:49] &gt;&gt; I'm reading the Bible.
[2:52:51] &gt;&gt; What do you do in Babylon?
[2:52:53] &gt;&gt; Job to verse four, my friend.
[2:52:56] &gt;&gt; What do you do in Babylon?
[2:52:58] &gt;&gt; Thus says the Lord of hosts.
[2:52:59] &gt;&gt; Thus says who?
[2:53:00] &gt;&gt; The Lord of hosts.
[2:53:01] &gt;&gt; Is it Jeremiah talking?
[2:53:03] &gt;&gt; Who's talking?
[2:53:05] Thus say the Lord of hosts the what?
[2:53:08] &gt;&gt; The God of Israel
[2:53:09] &gt;&gt; to who?
[2:53:10] &gt;&gt; All that are carried away captive.
[2:53:12] &gt;&gt; Everybody that is in Babylon doing
[2:53:15] nothing.
[2:53:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:53:19] &gt;&gt; Waiting for the rapture.
[2:53:22] &gt;&gt; I will get to that
[2:53:25] &gt;&gt; online. Don't be too quick. I'm loaded.
[2:53:28] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:53:30] &gt;&gt; Everybody that are there
[2:53:32] &gt;&gt; that are sitting there. He says all that
[2:53:34] are carried away how
[2:53:36] &gt;&gt; captives
[2:53:36] &gt;&gt; whom are whom what
[2:53:38] &gt;&gt; I have caused to be carried away from
[2:53:41] Jerusalem.
[2:53:43] &gt;&gt; Who caused
[2:53:44] &gt;&gt; God?
[2:53:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:53:46] &gt;&gt; Who caused you to go to Babylon?
[2:53:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. Lord
[2:53:52] &gt;&gt; who caused you to pass through that
[2:53:54] storm?
[2:53:56] &gt;&gt; Do you think he doesn't know what he's
[2:53:58] doing?
[2:54:00] &gt;&gt; Because the footstep of the righteous
[2:54:03] are ordered by who?
[2:54:05] &gt;&gt; Why are you traveling the the family you
[2:54:08] are going to?
[2:54:12] &gt;&gt; It it just happened like that.
[2:54:13] &gt;&gt; No.
[2:54:14] &gt;&gt; Did you choose your daddy?
[2:54:15] &gt;&gt; No.
[2:54:15] &gt;&gt; Did you choose your mommy?
[2:54:17] &gt;&gt; Why did they put you under that daddy
[2:54:19] and that man
[2:54:20] [Applause]
[2:54:22] &gt;&gt; and you keep looking? My daddy is a
[2:54:23] drunker. My daddy was a drunker. My
[2:54:25] daddy was a drunker. Leave the
[2:54:27] drunkenness.
[2:54:28] [Applause]
[2:54:30] My mama was a single mama. My mama was a
[2:54:33] single mama. My mama was a single mama.
[2:54:35] You sang that song for so long.
[2:54:37] &gt;&gt; There is a purpose why they put you and
[2:54:40] the single mama
[2:54:42] &gt;&gt; and the single daddy.
[2:54:45] [Applause]
[2:54:53] &gt;&gt; I have opened up the wheels of the
[2:54:55] airplane.
[2:54:58] Are we together?
[2:55:00] &gt;&gt; What do you do whom I have caused to do
[2:55:03] what?
[2:55:03] &gt;&gt; To be carried away captive
[2:55:05] &gt;&gt; to
[2:55:05] &gt;&gt; from Jerusalem unto Babylon.
[2:55:07] &gt;&gt; To Babylon. So when Nebuchadnezzar was
[2:55:11] coming,
[2:55:12] &gt;&gt; who did you see coming?
[2:55:16] &gt;&gt; Now, now you know God now.
[2:55:18] &gt;&gt; Now you know God. Now
[2:55:21] &gt;&gt; when the trial was coming, you called
[2:55:23] that the devil.
[2:55:26] &gt;&gt; You give so much credit to the devil.
[2:55:29] Even the trial that are bringing your
[2:55:31] blessing are always the devil
[2:55:33] &gt;&gt; because you see the devil everywhere.
[2:55:36] &gt;&gt; You see the devil in the cut, the devil
[2:55:39] in the dock, the devil in the police
[2:55:41] officer, the devil at the restaurant.
[2:55:43] You see the devil everywhere.
[2:55:53] &gt;&gt; When the traffic happen, it's the devil.
[2:55:56] You don't know if it's a protection for
[2:55:58] an accident. It's the devil.
[2:56:03] &gt;&gt; The supervisor don't like me. The devil.
[2:56:07] &gt;&gt; Who's who is in control of your life? So
[2:56:09] the devil.
[2:56:11] &gt;&gt; But today refocus your camera.
[2:56:23] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Are we together?
[2:56:26] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:56:28] &gt;&gt; Because it's too much complex
[2:56:30] &gt;&gt; among among message believer. Too much
[2:56:33] complex among message believer. I made a
[2:56:35] mistake. I believe I made a wrong
[2:56:37] choice. I believe I
[2:56:40] [Music]
[2:56:41] [Applause]
[2:56:46] &gt;&gt; So you telling God there are certain
[2:56:48] things that God do and certain things
[2:56:50] God is unable to do. That's the
[2:56:52] territory of the devil.
[2:57:00] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Look how much you
[2:57:02] beaten yourself down.
[2:57:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:57:05] &gt;&gt; And waiting to go back to Isaiah.
[2:57:10] So there is no no push in you
[2:57:16] &gt;&gt; no ability to move in life
[2:57:19] &gt;&gt; because you stuck
[2:57:21] &gt;&gt; waiting for the rapture waiting for the
[2:57:23] for the for the deliverance
[2:57:28] [Music]
[2:57:30] &gt;&gt; uh where are we at my friend so you can
[2:57:32] go home verse uh four verse five that
[2:57:35] say the Lord do what
[2:57:37] &gt;&gt; build Be houses
[2:57:39] &gt;&gt; beat houses where
[2:57:50] &gt;&gt; oh oh continue renting.
[2:57:54] &gt;&gt; We in Babylon.
[2:57:56] Continue renting.
[2:57:59] Continue renting. My friend built
[2:58:01] houses. In other words, Jeremiah sent
[2:58:03] the instruction. He said, "What are you
[2:58:05] doing over there sitting like that?
[2:58:08] &gt;&gt; Who told you you coming now?
[2:58:11] &gt;&gt; There is a season.
[2:58:13] &gt;&gt; Built houses there.
[2:58:17] &gt;&gt; Stop looking at Nebuchadnezzar the way
[2:58:19] you looking at him. As a matter of fact,
[2:58:22] you are brother Brandham used to use the
[2:58:25] word Ricky Ricky Ricky Rick Ricky Rick.
[2:58:28] God came down say stop that vocabulary.
[2:58:32] Those
[2:58:37] my children are there
[2:58:40] &gt;&gt; because you focusing on Nebuchadnezzar.
[2:58:42] Abanza captivity. Captivity. Captivity.
[2:58:44] Stop looking at Nebuchadnezzar like
[2:58:46] that. He's my servant.
[2:58:48] &gt;&gt; I gave everything to him
[2:58:50] &gt;&gt; and I carried you away captive under
[2:58:53] him.
[2:58:54] &gt;&gt; There is a purpose why I put you in
[2:58:57] Babylon.
[2:58:58] &gt;&gt; There is a purpose why you are in this
[2:59:01] Babylon.
[2:59:04] Amen.
[2:59:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:59:05] &gt;&gt; Build houses.
[2:59:06] &gt;&gt; Build houses.
[2:59:10] &gt;&gt; Don't say amen.
[2:59:11] &gt;&gt; Build houses.
[2:59:13] &gt;&gt; Come out and do what?
[2:59:16] &gt;&gt; Did he say when you built the house, so
[2:59:19] when the time of Exodus will come,
[2:59:21] somebody will build your home or will go
[2:59:23] live in your house?
[2:59:26] &gt;&gt; Who's going to dwell there?
[2:59:29] If God tell you build a house
[2:59:33] &gt;&gt; and dwell in them, what does it mean to
[2:59:35] you?
[2:59:40] &gt;&gt; Ah,
[2:59:42] &gt;&gt; in other word, all of you have the
[2:59:46] potential for houses.
[2:59:52] &gt;&gt; I'm going to Let's stop. You don't get
[2:59:54] it. You don't get it. Let's stop right
[2:59:57] here.
[2:59:58] &gt;&gt; When they say when God come,
[3:00:01] &gt;&gt; can you go see brother Charles and say
[3:00:03] have a baby?
[3:00:07] &gt;&gt; Carry a pregnancy.
[3:00:09] &gt;&gt; Because in him he's not built beautiful.
[3:00:11] &gt;&gt; You can only tell a woman that is mature
[3:00:13] that
[3:00:14] &gt;&gt; are we together. So now God is telling
[3:00:17] all no exception everybody that is there
[3:00:22] &gt;&gt; in Babylon. God say built houses.
[3:00:29] So when you were going to Babylon, where
[3:00:31] were you carrying?
[3:00:38] [Applause]
[3:00:40] &gt;&gt; You were carrying houses that have to be
[3:00:44] built not in Canaan.
[3:00:47] &gt;&gt; In other words, when you enter Babylon,
[3:00:49] those houses were already activated
[3:00:52] &gt;&gt; and here you are renting.
[3:00:56] And God say ah look in you
[3:01:00] &gt;&gt; where you are there you got a house
[3:01:03] &gt;&gt; everybody can build a house
[3:01:07] [Applause]
[3:01:13] &gt;&gt; it doesn't soak in.
[3:01:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[3:01:16] &gt;&gt; When God say built a house and dwelt
[3:01:19] there,
[3:01:21] &gt;&gt; how did you came into Babylon?
[3:01:24] &gt;&gt; Captive.
[3:01:25] &gt;&gt; What does a captive carry?
[3:01:29] &gt;&gt; So, how can you tell a captive built a
[3:01:31] house?
[3:01:31] &gt;&gt; From where?
[3:01:32] &gt;&gt; Where does he get the money?
[3:01:35] &gt;&gt; So, what type of faith
[3:01:38] &gt;&gt; does a captive need to have in Babylon?
[3:01:41] [Music]
[3:01:41] [Applause]
[3:01:42] Come on.
[3:01:44] &gt;&gt; I'm going to the airport.
[3:01:47] &gt;&gt; Let me start it again. If not, I'm going
[3:01:49] to jump again and move them and circle
[3:01:51] the airport because I need to go
[3:01:52] straight to the tarmac. Let me start
[3:01:54] again. I'm already on bu I'm just in
[3:01:57] building the house and I will stop. Then
[3:01:58] we going to pick up the other one. Plant
[3:02:00] vineyard later. So build a house. When
[3:02:03] God tells you God is talking to who?
[3:02:06] When you were taken captive. Were you
[3:02:09] were you going on vacation?
[3:02:11] &gt;&gt; Did you have the time to sit down and
[3:02:13] prepare your luggages and say, "I need
[3:02:16] my perfume. I need this. I need this. I
[3:02:18] make sure all my scissors and everybody
[3:02:20] in there and my haircut and whatever and
[3:02:22] my be." Did you have time to get it?
[3:02:24] &gt;&gt; They were picking you up. How?
[3:02:26] &gt;&gt; Captive. So, you were going how?
[3:02:31] &gt;&gt; How were you going to Babylon?
[3:02:32] &gt;&gt; Unprepared.
[3:02:33] &gt;&gt; Unprepared.
[3:02:35] &gt;&gt; Because God don't want you to depend.
[3:02:39] on your ability.
[3:02:41] &gt;&gt; Come on, brother.
[3:02:43] &gt;&gt; Spoken way.
[3:02:46] &gt;&gt; There is a reason why God have to snatch
[3:02:49] you like that.
[3:02:52] &gt;&gt; Do you know he told the the disciple go
[3:02:55] preach
[3:02:56] &gt;&gt; and they want to preach, he say, hey,
[3:02:57] hey, give me your wallet.
[3:02:59] &gt;&gt; Leave your wallet here.
[3:03:02] &gt;&gt; Hey,
[3:03:03] &gt;&gt; we going to preach the gospel. Leave
[3:03:05] your wallet.
[3:03:06] Uh, I'm going to get my suit.
[3:03:09] &gt;&gt; How many are you taking?
[3:03:10] &gt;&gt; One. Leave the other. No. No. But it
[3:03:13] will be a convention.
[3:03:15] Leave your suit there.
[3:03:17] &gt;&gt; But
[3:03:18] about money. Jesus said, "Don't take
[3:03:20] money."
[3:03:21] &gt;&gt; What was he training his disciple?
[3:03:24] [Applause]
[3:03:27] &gt;&gt; In other words, where you going? What is
[3:03:29] there?
[3:03:33] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. So God was
[3:03:36] changing this captive
[3:03:38] &gt;&gt; from a state to a different state
[3:03:43] &gt;&gt; from a state on depending on Israel
[3:03:46] &gt;&gt; to a state where they must depend on God
[3:03:51] &gt;&gt; because they weren't empty
[3:03:54] &gt;&gt; and God yet tell them build a house.
[3:03:58] &gt;&gt; How are you going to build a house when
[3:03:59] you were taken captive? Right?
[3:04:01] &gt;&gt; It means that it takes a different faith
[3:04:04] in Babylon.
[3:04:06] &gt;&gt; It takes a faith that believe the word
[3:04:09] and call on things that are not
[3:04:17] &gt;&gt; as though they are.
[3:04:21] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[3:04:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. So when the letter is coming from
[3:04:25] Jeremiah and say build a house and
[3:04:30] dwelling the question is who say that?
[3:04:34] The Bible say thus save the Lord.
[3:04:37] &gt;&gt; If it does that say the Lord and he
[3:04:39] reach my ear
[3:04:41] &gt;&gt; it is
[3:04:44] &gt;&gt; whether there is money
[3:04:47] &gt;&gt; whether there is no money
[3:04:51] &gt;&gt; whether I have established a credit
[3:04:54] &gt;&gt; in Babylon or no credit in Babylon. All
[3:04:59] I need is that safe the Lord.
[3:05:02] &gt;&gt; Because I got that safe the Lord
[3:05:05] &gt;&gt; from that time on.
[3:05:07] &gt;&gt; I'm going to build a house.
[3:05:11] [Applause]
[3:05:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:05:14] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[3:05:15] &gt;&gt; In other words, God already anointed
[3:05:18] those people
[3:05:20] &gt;&gt; with a special anointing
[3:05:22] &gt;&gt; to fulfill certain things in Babylon.
[3:05:26] But the people were sitting doing
[3:05:29] nothing.
[3:05:30] &gt;&gt; The people were confused doing nothing
[3:05:34] and losing the opportunity
[3:05:37] &gt;&gt; to transform their life
[3:05:39] &gt;&gt; with the power of transformation
[3:05:42] &gt;&gt; that went with them
[3:05:48] &gt;&gt; the money was there.
[3:05:50] &gt;&gt; When I say this, you don't understand
[3:05:52] me. But in Revelation 17, we are in
[3:05:55] mystery Babylon.
[3:05:58] &gt;&gt; And this is we are in mystery Babylon.
[3:06:02] All your banking system
[3:06:06] &gt;&gt; is controlled by the harot.
[3:06:11] &gt;&gt; It depends on how you look it.
[3:06:14] &gt;&gt; I don't care what the hallot is.
[3:06:17] &gt;&gt; My point is who is God
[3:06:19] &gt;&gt; and what is God telling me at this time?
[3:06:22] Amen.
[3:06:24] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[3:06:25] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Why did he send me thy
[3:06:28] word
[3:06:29] &gt;&gt; like this word
[3:06:31] &gt;&gt; in the midst of Babylon?
[3:06:33] &gt;&gt; There must be a season.
[3:06:35] &gt;&gt; I will get to that next time the Lord
[3:06:37] willing. Let's stop here, my friend.
[3:06:40] &gt;&gt; Let's stand.
[3:06:41] [Applause]
[3:06:50] [Laughter]
[3:06:53] But you understand
[3:06:55] &gt;&gt; what to focus on.
[3:06:58] &gt;&gt; You understand what you're looking at.
[3:07:07] &gt;&gt; Don't make a decision
[3:07:10] based on Trump.
[3:07:13] &gt;&gt; Leave Trump alone.
[3:07:15] &gt;&gt; He already gave you signal.
[3:07:17] &gt;&gt; The last Trump and then this this this.
[3:07:19] Leave him alone.
[3:07:21] &gt;&gt; You will get upset unnecessarily.
[3:07:25] &gt;&gt; You will blow your TV.
[3:07:31] &gt;&gt; You will get upset against nature now.
[3:07:34] &gt;&gt; You wasting your time
[3:07:37] &gt;&gt; focusing another thing
[3:07:40] &gt;&gt; and look what is going on now.
[3:07:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:07:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:07:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[3:07:48] &gt;&gt; I have a scripture.
[3:07:51] &gt;&gt; Every single king, God is directing
[3:07:54] them.
[3:07:55] &gt;&gt; I have a Bible scripture.
[3:07:57] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[3:07:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:07:59] &gt;&gt; Because your question is why did he use
[3:08:00] Nebuchadnezzar? I can show you in the
[3:08:02] Bible. I have a time is gone.
[3:08:04] &gt;&gt; The Bible say the heart of the king now
[3:08:07] is are in the hand of God. It's written
[3:08:09] in your Bible.
[3:08:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:08:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:08:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:08:14] &gt;&gt; He choose who's going to be where. Not
[3:08:17] you.
[3:08:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[3:08:20] &gt;&gt; If they give you your choice, we will
[3:08:22] put message believer everywhere.
[3:08:25] &gt;&gt; The prime minister will be a message
[3:08:26] believer. The president will be a
[3:08:28] message believer. All the Supreme Court
[3:08:30] will be message believer. Uh uh God, it
[3:08:32] doesn't work like that.
[3:08:35] [Laughter]
[3:08:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. If they give you everywhere
[3:08:40] message believer, God don't work like
[3:08:41] that. God take a hidden and put him
[3:08:43] there
[3:08:44] &gt;&gt; and you keep focusing on the hidden.
[3:08:47] And all you see is bad.
[3:08:49] &gt;&gt; You're missing the good thing that are
[3:08:51] going on.
[3:08:52] &gt;&gt; You're missing five years.
[3:08:57] &gt;&gt; We miss millions.
[3:09:01] &gt;&gt; We did miss millions.
[3:09:04] &gt;&gt; What were we looking at?
[3:09:07] &gt;&gt; What were we looking at?
[3:09:09] &gt;&gt; Who what was distracting you?
[3:09:14] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[3:09:16] Stay focused.
[3:09:18] &gt;&gt; God willing, we will pick up on this
[3:09:20] story and we will continue down to see
[3:09:24] what causes us to miss this type of
[3:09:26] stuff.
[3:09:28] Amen.
[3:09:29] &gt;&gt; And you will see.
[3:09:32] And remember who took Israel to Egypt?
[3:09:38] &gt;&gt; No. Naturally,
[3:09:41] &gt;&gt; Joseph. Hatred. And what?
[3:09:46] Jealousy. How did Israel come back?
[3:09:50] &gt;&gt; In the book of Jeremiah, who picked
[3:09:53] Israel from the promised land?
[3:09:56] &gt;&gt; No. No. Naturally,
[3:09:58] &gt;&gt; a king called who?
[3:10:00] &gt;&gt; I will show you next Sunday. Who took
[3:10:02] Israel back?
[3:10:13] If Israel went with a king, who's going
[3:10:16] to
[3:10:17] &gt;&gt; who's going to take Israel back?
[3:10:20] &gt;&gt; And I will show you who is that king
[3:10:22] before God.
[3:10:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:10:29] &gt;&gt; When you see a storm, what do you call
[3:10:31] it?
[3:10:34] When you see pressure, what do you call
[3:10:36] it?
[3:10:37] &gt;&gt; When you see something bad, what do you
[3:10:39] call it?
[3:10:40] &gt;&gt; And it's heading toward me.
[3:10:44] &gt;&gt; You heading toward me.
[3:10:46] &gt;&gt; You do, my friend,
[3:10:47] &gt;&gt; you're going to turn into a blessing.
[3:10:50] [Music]
[3:10:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:10:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:10:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's built for you. Let's pray.
[3:10:57] Heavenly Father, Lord, we approaching
[3:10:59] you humbly this afternoon. Father,
[3:11:02] thanking you for your grace, your love,
[3:11:05] your mercy, Father, and for everything
[3:11:07] you have been doing for us. Father, this
[3:11:10] is as far as you wanted us to go. You
[3:11:13] want your children to focus on the right
[3:11:15] thing
[3:11:16] &gt;&gt; in season, Lord.
[3:11:19] Father, how do we discern?
[3:11:21] Very easy to discern natural things.
[3:11:25] Like you spoke yourself, you say you can
[3:11:27] discern the face of the sky. But how are
[3:11:30] you not able to discern
[3:11:33] the time, the sun of the time? And
[3:11:36] father, today you spoke to us. You came
[3:11:39] down to let us discern in the midst of
[3:11:43] our trial
[3:11:45] to see you in everything
[3:11:48] because what seems to be a mountain look
[3:11:52] like a hill from heaven point of view
[3:11:55] Lord. Father you call us to this age for
[3:11:59] a reason.
[3:12:02] What an age to live in. But we are
[3:12:05] living there. And why are we here in
[3:12:08] such an age?
[3:12:10] What are we focusing on? Father, help us
[3:12:14] not to miss our blessing. Our blessing
[3:12:17] naturally,
[3:12:18] spiritually, financially, materially,
[3:12:23] physically, in every aspect of our life.
[3:12:26] &gt;&gt; You want your children to be totally
[3:12:28] free. Father, I pray for the church here
[3:12:31] and those online that you continue to
[3:12:33] minister. And if time t for you to come,
[3:12:37] may we meet again and continue in the
[3:12:39] things of the kingdom. Thank you for
[3:12:42] your children that press on and bless us
[3:12:44] even Lord father for the water baptism
[3:12:48] mad. You know what you did in the life
[3:12:50] of your son and something prick his
[3:12:53] heart to be baptized. Lord father again
[3:12:56] Lord may you granted unto him his
[3:13:00] reward. If you did it for a hidden king,
[3:13:03] you can do it, Lord, Father, for your
[3:13:05] children. Lord, we humbly ask it in the
[3:13:08] name of Jesus Christ. Amen.
[3:13:12] &gt;&gt; God bless you, church. We love you,
[3:13:14] Roger.
[3:13:17] Amen.
