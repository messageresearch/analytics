aren't you happy tonight I am happy as David stated that his heart was always when he has to go to the house of the Lord because in the house of God we find everything just like the pastor usually said here that's where you put your car in neutral you don't do any effort because it's written that the Beloved while they sleeping God brings down His blessings and we will see it I believe it's in Psalm 127 1 to two amen amen let's go straight to our scriptures I thank the pastor for this opportunity to hand me the pulpit may God bless him and bless everything that he's doing especially the charge the responsibility God gave him amen amen okay J let's go to the book of First Peter chapter 1 can everyone hear me okay if you dare you can say Amen 1 Peter 1 3-7 okay I will read it in the name of Jesus Christ blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ which according to His abundant Mercy has begotten us again unto a lovely Hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead inheritance Incorruptible and undefiled and that fadeth not away reserved in heaven for you you might be seated let's pray so I will continue with my reading Eternal God Almighty here we are tonight we know that you always comeing come down in the evening time in the and in this end time it's in the end time that you came in to give us a special message in this evening time lord tonight we are in th presence father the people came in your presence not in even we who are preaching we are Lord in that presence we are waiting because your word is a two sword we want you to speak to us tonight that you heal us tonight that you deliver us tonight because your word delivers you spoke through your Prophet that by the preaching of the word that's the means by which your people receive the spirit and Paul also spoke it to James I believe in James 3:12 that by the hearing of faith that we your people receive the spirit of God father let that your spirit come down in the heart of your people and all that are trouble all that are in Trials may they be comforted in your presence show them that you never abandon them we commit tonight the sermon under your control move me completely out of the way move us completely out of the way and may you begin again from the pulit to the janitor we want to be blessed as we ask in the name of Jesus Christ father every Spirit contrary to your word Let It Be know the Holy Spirit take the prence may your people receive solution to all their problem in the name of Jesus am amen God richly bless you again we are glad to be in the house of our father I'm going to continue my reading I'm in verse six wherein you greatly Rejoice let me start back it seems like I skipped something verse five who are kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation ready to be revealed in the last time wherein you greatly Rejoice though now for a season if needed be you are in heaviness through manifold Temptations amen amen that the trial of your faith being much more precious than God than God that perishes though he be tried with fire might be found unto praise and honor and Glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ may the Lord bless the reading of his word amen I'm going to read one more scripture in the Book of James 1 verse2 I'm going to read in the name of Jesus Christ the Bible stated as this blessed is the man that endureth Temptation for when he is tried he shall receive the Crown of Life which the Lord has promised to them that love him amen amen you see here God will give you the Crown of Life what will a VTO a man to win the whole world and to lose his own soul after you gain everything and at the end you lose your soul now you won't even have the control of what you have been accting so what are you going to do with it and where we read in First Peter precisely in verse S that's where I'm Joy my title tonight being much more precious the trial of your faith being more much more precious than of gold that perish and the result is that you might be found unto praise and honor and Glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ my tile tonight is the trial of your faith triggers God's glory if you don't have trial God won't receive the glory amen amen if you don't have trial your God won't receive his glory that's what we are just about to look into blessed be the name of the [Music] Lord in the sermon Hebrew the series of Hebrews brother says this paragraph 27 uh 21 Hebrew on 1957 oh brother Bram say now we don't know whether the congregation so that son or not but Moses saw it for Moses first met him in a burning bush amen amen he was a fire and the children of Israel obeyed Moses and left Egypt amen amen and as soon as they come out of Egypt they come out of Egypt God we found LED them right into a trap God hallelujah LED them into a trap God let them in a trap maybe you are worrying too much why am I in such a situation in this problem God knows because he's seeking for glory amen glory to God blessed be the name of the Lord [Applause] amen where Pharaoh's Army behind them and the Red Sea on either side and God put them to test and they got scared and he provoked God he said why do you cry at me just speak and go forward brother Bram say I like that you have the word you have the message you have the Bible but he said if my word dwelleth abideth in you and you it is not your word it is not your battle it is God in the test that he put you into if you only take the word and then present the word to your trial this is exactly what the Lord Jesus Christ did and we will see that too let me watch my time okay so I will read quickly so God help me in 28 brother now we no here then he said for some when they heard did provoke certainly every time they get to a place where a showdown come then what would they do they would fly Lo and get weary and they want to turn back and why did this happen to me why did this happen to me this is our Behavior this is how we ask ourselves question why did this happen to me it is God who told me to come out of Egypt it is God who told me to come out of the world now I'm in the message I go to church but still I have trouble why why why why me that's the same thing that happened to Israel but God will show you something God will show you what he want from you blessed be the name of the Lord in the impersonation of Christian paragraph [Music] 189 brother Bram say with our heads bowed just in this solemn [Music] moment maybe at this very moment they may rest upon you upon this church or many here brother Bram say think deep do not let it be shallow thinking thinking but go deep are you making love to the Holy Spirit [Music] is that spirit that is in your life taking out your emotions exactly with the Bible have you long suffering gentleness goodness we not testing material is not tested listen as you pray brother I'm saying I'm in paragraph 190 amen amen listen where we read here brother Bram say are you really align exactly with the Bible and what is in the Bible we have virtues in the Bible we have patience we have long suffering we have temper we got love we got gentleness we got goodness and so forth so brother Bram ask a question brother is asking how can you test the material you look at the microphone I have here it's a material things how canot test test one two test one one two how do you test do I just look at the color being beautiful or is he a small microphone or big one brother Bram say it is not based on that it's by the power it's the power of the microphone that is echoing when I speak that's how you test the microphone when I speak you hear amen amen this is what brother want to explain and brother explained that in 190 the test of material it's not I mean by strength what brother Bram was trying to show take your time you can read it I know I'm skipping I don't want to take your time take [Music] time brother Bram say material is not tested by its quantity how big it is how big a church I'm meaning here is not tested by its quantity but by its quality its strength the church is not tested on how big a church or how many members it is tested by its strength by the Bible how can he say Amen to every promise that God has [Music] given how does your life move with kindness are you kindness are you me gentleness patience are you patient amen amen what is it when something R you there is a little wheel there taking right away keeps you under control his love moves right down through your heart are you only trying to put that on amen amen amen amen amen amen blessed be the name of the Lord this is the purpose of our subject tonight the trial of your faith it triggers God's glory you will remember the woman with the issues of blood she suffered for so long but when she met [Applause] Christ Jesus got the glory god got his own Glory every time you meet Christ will happen to you blessed be the name of the Lord in God keeps his word April 7th 1957 in the morning paragraph 104 brother Bram says this he brought the people out on their Road up they start rebelling against the prophet and against the angel and against the God and against their word and they got into trouble the Bible says they was a mixed multitude that went with them a mixed multitude came out they came out and when he did they came to a place ofes and when they got to Kadesh that was the Judgment seat where trials must be settled amen Amen brother Bram is saying this when Israel came out of Egypt they begin to rebel against Moses let me open a little parenthesis they were just like the church just like spoken word is a church we are in a church and we come to church and the purpose you come to this church we have one common destination is to go to heaven but each one of us here we have our special your destination is not M the destination of is not each one has its purpose but one thing we have one place we all go we are going all to Heaven amen amen so instead of coming to church to get prepare for heaven sometime we think the church is a business that we can even uh put people together for marriage or maybe if somebody is not single so he can find the church to get married the church is not a company where we where people are seeking for positions or if you don't have a job because you pray and you don't have a job so you will leave this church and go to another one amen and you will notice most of the time even when somebody's in need he come to church he have problem for God to bless him and the day God bless him the pastor who prayed when you are blessed you enter the season of blessing that's at the time now you begin to quit coming to [Applause] church now you begin to have all kind of plans oh let me go play golf on Sunday maybe your great great great great great great great great grandfather where they are in the cemetery they are scratching their head and say what is it doing in go when did you learn golf in our family since when you start playing gol oh since when you going to the beach let me close that [Music] part blessed be the name of paragraph 116 if you can only understand this little church now that's where we want to tighten it a little bit now listen closely Kadesh it was a time of test every child that cometh to God must be tried there is no ction God will test every child that cometh to him is not that true the church say Amen the Bible say and now we see when trial comes and trial and test let me read something in the memorial [Music] 108 was talking about someone who was uh who could who was working in different material and test them through fire let me go he says if he went through that much trouble to be sure that that bridge will be safe how much trouble you think God to be sure this church will be safe yes sir there is a memorial to the death of Christ that is his church some people don't want to leave it some people will but it's a testing time God is testing people today for his memorials you will see it sooner as we going to speak about Shadrach we will talk about Joseph we will talk about Daniel those people are not here but they are memoral why because they represented God they were in difficult situation they went to trials and you will see how did they come out of those trials brother Bram say a lot of time people say oh I am so tempted long years ago before they had the smelters no no continue okay they used to take the gold and how they would know how he was right or not and all the slge is out of it all the iron parrot that is full that is full goats all the fools was out of it the beaters beat it and turn it and beat it and turn it until the be seen his reflection in the gold meaning you standing and you look at the gold and you see yourself as in the mirror you say okay now the gold is pure amen amen that's the way God does to his church he gives you trial after trial test after test trial after trial test after test the Life of Christ is reflected in your life until you become peaceful sober Meek gentle humble hallelujah hallelujah blessed be the name of the Lord ready submissive willing turn your head on the things of the world and looking straight to Calvary amen amen I believe the calvary is somewhere you know what Calvary means when we see Jesus he bring us back to Cal we remember Cal because that's where he pay everything amen amen and chastisement oface was upon Him amen amen to the one who is doing the beating have you ever seen a child when you beat him and he look on he usually focus on the one beating that's what brother Bram is saying when God is Jing you when there is a trial you have to continue to Focus On Christ amen amen because he's trying to build something in you if you can notice that together with me maybe you are not patient maybe you don't have tempers maybe you don't have love how can you buy love with what how can you buy patience what can you use to buy Temperance all the virtues that the Bible speak speak about that we must add onto add May Faith how can you buy Faith what can you give in change to fath for you to have faith he only takes a test only a difficult situation only a problem and the problem when it comes I'm talking about big problem where you are just about to cry if you have to amen amen let me continue quickly okay to the one who is doing the bidding many times you think it's strange because of fiery trials because you are under Fire sickness persecutions brother Bram say it's only done to test you to get the dirt out of you to get the slud out of to get the slowness out of you to wake you up to the place where you can look see the reflection of a man can see the reflection of Christ in you so somebody can see Christ in you when somebody look at you but this is this is a little CH this is a child of God this is a God just like those people that spoke to Paul when Paul didn't die they said this is God and sometime they say this is God look God coming in human came to us amen amen because those people gave their life completely to godr in you they go for Glory the fire only Waters it brother Bram says he only give us New Hope he only strengthens it every Tri every every time a wind hits a tree and shove it back and forth and back and forth he only losen the root can grow deeper and get a better home every time sickness St your home every time trial St your home every time the neighbor say something bad about you it's shaking you losen you up so you can go down a better hold on the Eternal Rock of God's unmovable word that is how God does it that's how God does it he send those trial to test you and to prove you to shake you up and give you a New Hope and you hold Amen in the time of trial when you are in school for instance they give you a test they won't give you the book you were studying test or your personal note so that you can cheat start answering in the test amen amen amen amen during the test is not a time to receive instruction brother say it's not the time to it is not an educational day it is time testing it is a time that God is testing his church to find the batt SCS of our Tri and fights and battles that is the one who will ride by his by his side on a chariot the one who sit with him God will shake you up first by trials to make sure 150 brother Bram speak about Elisha I'm going to skip some stuff brother say how Elish tested and proven and proved before he could wear a prophet how El throw that robe around his shoulder how he must be the right man Elisha watched him there in the field when he was plowing my apology I'm going to take my jacket off hallelujah hallelujah when he was plowing God said that's the man that's the man that can wear their that's the man that can wear that Ro he can take your place blessed be the name of the Lord how his allseeing eye is moving over the Earth to find some man that shall wear that Ro that he talk about can you drink the cup that I drink can you be baptized with the baptis you can he said to that yes blessed be the name of the Lord amen I'm going to read possessing the enemy's gate God has been testing the patriarch because he has given him a promise and when God makes a promise he want to be sure that this person is worthy of the promise before he fulfill what he said or what he promised amen amen so Abraham had been promised that through his seed the whole world will be blessed that he would have a son and this son out of him should come forth a seed that will bless the whole Earth and Abraham when he was about 77 75 years and Sarah when he was and Sarah 65 tell us that Abraham scattered at the promise of God through unbelief strong giving praise to God and God time after time he had come to the final test before bless was going to happen I'm going to speak something in the Book of Daniel chapter 3 paragraph ver 18 318 24 27 25 or 30 you know the story about the three Hebrews amen amen you know amen blessed be the name of the Lord never gave to Temptation when you read I'm trying to skip it so I can save time they didn't give into the Temptation when they come to their trial they accepted to go to the fiery f in instead of compromising or destroy the message of they accepted to go to the trial with joy amen amen they took the fiery furnace with joy in paragraph 33 in the message what house will that build in 19651 brother Bram says this I'm not sure if you got it here you can read it okay brother says this keep the message honorable and live correctly and don't let uh don't let filth come upon we are living in a late hour now let's live in Purity in other words my life your life our life together our life together we need to progress with God and Christians speak about uh holy things and good things and sinners speak about filthy things and things that are not good and sing all kind of dirty songs amen amen it's in the message be certain of God as well paragraph 48 and 49 blessed be the name of the Lord be certain of God just to add up to the prophet's thought he says this okay brother Bram says this he it has been a time let's look at two of these cases let's speak about the Hebrew that's what we are just about to speak about they could not bow down before an image God trusted them and when they learn that they have to go to their fiery trial they say whether God Deliver Us from theurn even though even if he doesn't do it we will never bow down before you your IM do you see they were sure and certain of God these are people that took a stand for the word they kept the word pure never want to bring filthy to even though they were far away from their their own land amen amen paragraph 49 he knew that he was Jehovah they knew that God hear their prayer whether he comes or not in their place it is going to be for their good anyway so they only made their statement confess their sin and they move toward death am amen they move to death and let's go back to the trial of these three HEB once they were in the their God never let them alone to go andone in the fire god was there with them inside the furnace and this is what surprised the king this is what surprised King Nebuchadnezzar when you read it amen amen and then he took word when he was scared to see the face of the Fourth Man In The Fire these three Hebrew were also uh uh uh surprised to be the fiery furnace and they were inside the fiery furnace he seven times but they were surprised that nothing happened to them nothing happened to them they didn't see the fourth man yet amen the Bible didn't say that my Bible didn't say that that they saw the Fourth Man but there was a presence of an invisible uh before the the visible That You Don't See usually they had God they pray and fast and they were in order and they confessed their and they went in the furnace and once in the F God went there with them that's why even though they were hided nothing could happen to them why because inside of them there was a a devouring fire somebody who's called a devouring fire the almighty God the Creator God his name is also a devouring power he was there and in this urgent Time God never sent an angel God came down himself that's why when this King saw when the king saw that he was scared he didn't want them to be killed the king came down in the furnace when he came closer he be to call them with a sad voice because for him they were dead and he was sad and he called them and he heard the name he saw the Fourth Man and then he said didn't we put three men where is the fourth one my brother my sister brothers and sisters as God is calling you beloved you will understand who is really a beloved amen amen God will never forsake you in front of any obacle even in sickness even if you going through pain just know that God is dead God is not far he's in you he wanted to see through you how can you produce the word how can you create the word how can you work with the sword amen amen because that's his way that's how Jesus did you will notice in Jesus Cas when Jesus received the Holy just like when you gave your life to Christ it was not Jesus that went and Pok the devil it was the spirit of the Lord that led fill with the spirit after the spirit of God Came Upon and they took him to the Wilderness to tempt him and what did Jesus say he proved with the word that it's written it's written let's go back to the three Hebrews these three Hebrews their furnace hid it seven times in the furnace they didn't see they didn't know that God was with them in that trial just like you in your trial just know that God is there is an Invisible Presence That You Don't See let me tell you this from the invisible that's where everything was created it comes from the invisible if you want to live in this world if you want to overcome you must have the invisible close to you you must have God if you have a business or maybe you are married or maybe you are you have a job it is not your diploma or it's not your degree it is not your knowledge that can protect you in your marriage that can protect you at work that can protect you where you are or wherever you are not your intelligence that will protect you in your business you must have the invisible with you maybe when you go even into shopping in Chinese you will see their adults in the store that's their God of protection in the store how can you be a Christian you can go somewhere without God you just going to you going to work and then somebody take advantage wherever you go in you just go in just like that you just go in I mean physically you will be taken advantage of you will be tired because you don't have a protection you must go wherever you going with your protection and your protection is the Lord Jesus Christ amen take him wherever you going blessed be the name of the Lord let me read something in Psalm 127 Solomon was very spiritual very spiritual because when we speak about beloved sometime we don't understand and we don't understand what beloved mean listen to what Solomon say and by the grace of God if we can grab something from there blessed be the name of the Lord may God help us amen blessed be the name of the Lord Psalm 27 one and two and I'm going to explain it a little bit SP on it what the Lord because God want to help some to pull somebody out of a situation the Bible says a song of degrees for Solomon a song of degrees listen to that song except the Lord built their house labor in V that building you understand except the Lord keep the city The Watchmen waketh but in vain amen amen [Music] two and I will expand on it it is in vain it is vain for you to rise up early to sit up [Music] late to eat the bread of Sorrows listen for he giveth his beloved sleep that's right when you sleeping do you understand something when you [Music] sleeping some people get bread with Sorrows but for the Beloved God come when you sleep and he brings his bless how does God come down God come down at night why because the Beloved are in contact with the maker they are in contact with him in prayer when the day start in a true sense look at the government did you ever seen the government office working at night they work during the day why are they working only during the day because a night that's when they take true decision even those that are great politic they work at night magician work at night those that are in big position in government they are in great positions that the people wanted to be like them you will find out that a night they are doing things at night they doing all kind of dirty stuff at night they're going into ceter night they're doing things at night because God require worship somehow so they got to do something but you the Beloved what are you going to do you meet that person he will tell you with your God you're going to church you're just going to church you need to leave your church but he at night he doesn't sleep he's working at night in bad places just to give Glory or do a sacrifice or to do all kind of but you they didn't require you to give any offering all the offering is already the cross the Lord Jesus Christ is your offering the prayer is your offering amen therefore Solomon is saying if the Lord doesn't build a house in those that built it even Wherever You Are never say that my intelligence wherever you going everybody bring their God each person have their God El Let each person call on their God it means everybody have their own God but you who are your God it's the Lord etal when you call upon when you are praying you call him a night time you also God will bring his when you coming up in the morning you will see all doors wide open all doors wide open with Victor because the Lord already brought the blessing that's why the Lord said if he doesn't watch over the city even if you're building something you will work for nothing they will destroy it somebody will bech you you start a business they will come and uh rob you amen why because you don't have God but if you have God he's the one that watch over is he doesn't sleep nor Slumbers that's where we can put our trust into let me read something on the book of act paragraph the act of the Holy Spirit actually that brother BR preaches paragraph the Bible says this those that will teach righteousness shall Shine Like Stars like stars they shall outand Stars forever and Hallelujah brother it's a good thing to be a pre after all isn't it yes it is it's a good thing to be a Christian times may be hard God has not promised a flowy bed of but he has promised Grace sufficient for every trial that can hit you that's right yes indeed grace is sufficient not his on a flower flower bed of his but God promis grace to overcome in every when a cross gets heavy Christ promised to be with you when a cross get heavy when your cross become heavy say God promised to be with you that's why the three Hebrews because the trial was Heavy the fourth man came on the scene and he went there to come down the fire to protect his children same thing about Daniel if I can touch him a little bit if you go to the Book of Daniel 6 verse4 I wanted to read he was accused because of his faithfulness and they could not find anything wrong with him nothing wrong he refused to dishonor his God he refused to cut his Fellowship because when you when you break the scriptures your fellowship is broken with God amen amen because they forbid him or to worship His God he says th one I cannot obey that law he widely opened his windows what was he doing during trials he was praying he was singing he was uh giving Thanksgiving amen amen that's what Daniel was doing and he was giving Thanksgiving and his enemy ploted against him they told the king that Daniel is not following the laws you will notice that the king didn't want to let him go because of the enemy because of the pressure from the enemy because the king already knew that Daniel worship a true God so he was cornered by the laws of the mid and but even though he let Dan go the Bible says that he didn't even go to his wife night he was actually praying he didn't even eat he refused when it comes to a child of God a problem of a child of God the king cannot sleep it's like when they brought Jesus CHR and the woman say [Music] P's wife say I didn't sleep because of this man leave this man alone but he was stubborn am amen so that was the king dasas and he came down early in the morning and he begin to call Daniel with a S Voice at Alliance then Daniel Dani Daniel and Daniel answer about oh King live eternally when the king heard the voice he brought him up of the tri but those that accused him the same people that put the trial that put the people in the trial you know for Shadrach M and abedo they say that they need to grab the people they uh they took those accus their children and put them back in the same place in the same place they put the Tre that's where the same thing with Daniel the king orain commanded that they took these people the accuser of your life the devil in the same fire in in the same de Lions then and then the lion killed and ate them you will notice these people went through trial after every trial you will find out that God highly exalted them the three Hebrews they become governors of the province amen am amen Daniel the same thing he begin to reign with the King to tell you that through every trial when God start a trial he's trying to bring you up he's trying to give you something to do to give you a responsibility that's what I'm going to touch it up now I won't be taking long anymore Joseph in Genesis 4141 39 1- 20 they sold him amen amen he was sold first headed by his brother his family 372 they put him in a pit imagine if he was you it's a trial am amen they took him to a strange people and sold he went to a city he didn't know anyone and over there they sell him even in Egypt and from there he goes to the prison I'm going quickly cutting stuff out amen amen there are many things that we can go through it I have not even touched why the trial and Joseph went through all these trials and the same for Jesus Christ Joseph underwent all the and he took them with joy sold twice hated by his family he was still happy James 1112 the Bible say blessed is who endureth patiently the Temptation we read that scripture because after the trial you will receive the Crown of Life the Lord the Lord promise to those that love him Jesus say in John 16:21 he's talking about uh the about a woman that when a woman is pregnant when he comes time for delivery she will go through pain she will go through trial it's a it's a test because she can die she is between life and death amen but once the baby is delivered forget all that's the same thing with us children of God when trial comes we are praying we are crying we are tormented but if you hold firm to the word of God God is there to deliver you God is there to bring you up to another dimension listen to this God will never test us the same way we don't get the same kind of testing because some are golden vessels some silver Vel some uh clay some brass that's why I say even your you don't have the same destination you don't have the same Destiny but we know that commonly we will hit Heaven one day but in our life we have our own destiny amen amen blessed be the name of the Lord that's why we won't go through the same fire meaning that we won't have all the same trial why because if you are a silver vessel you cannot undergo the fire of a gold amen amen blessed be the name of God Amen blessed be the name of the Lord you won't you won't take it you won't take it like a you will be burned but somehow you going to go Maybe by water so every person have his own Destin all as Christian we have one destination if you are converted there is one condition are you converted amen amen amen amen that's why we don't leave the same trial but once we are converted you will go through different trials I'm not talking about little trial I'm talking about big trials great difficulty suffering pains amen amen you think oh I'm going to get married it's a good thing into marriage trouble start you say oh if I get kids it's come trouble stop it's a trial but just know that God is with you to overcome that [Applause] Temptation the same trial because we don't have the same Destiny why Tri what is a trial trial is a time it's a period it's a season that come in the life of every human every child of God that is converted will have a time a period that will remove joy that will remove peace that will remove exaltation if you go to Genesis 41 verse1 there the dream that the king had uh seven years of famine and and of Plenty because there were seven years of plenty and seven years of but there were other seven years that were waiting to grab everything to take everything all the Plenty out amen amen meaning that things come in season there is a period there is a time just as a definition of a have to come in each one of our Liv or each person here Because by the power you had yesterday by the power of yesterday that's when you get strength I want to say this by your trial of yesterday that's why you have uh a way of living what you are today what you going to leave tomorrow you need the strength of today for tomorrow so the own future you need to eat right now the word to prepare for the oncoming [Applause] test the the responsibility of Tomorrow the responsibility you will have tomorrow that God will give you tomorrow God begin to prepare you today and God uses the trial of today maybe in your father's or mother house that's where you getting your training you will see mommy whooping you Daddy whooping you so that tomorrow you might be able to take a responsibility to have to take things in charge and if we human beings we do that to our children how can our God before he give you a responsibility he must put you through a trial just like El and elij he was following Elijah everywhere amen amen that's why I said it I'm speaking about spiritual strength amen amen because remember Cale older as he he remembered Joshua give me my Mountain he say I'm still strong just like when I was young it's not naturally but spiritually he had the he say I must possess I need my portion just like you a child of God you must possess everywhere that everywhere that your foot stand upon you must possess he said give me my Mountain give me my Mountain amen amen [Applause] I have to stop I'm trying to see where I can land it is the strength that you used yesterday that's what will allow you to stand or the responsibility of tomorrow must be prepared by the strength you drawing today through trial and where do you draw those strength it's in the trials trials brings character and character will produce virtues difficult time difficult moment suffering pains those difficult time when you hold tight it will birth into you a character and it will produce and it will produce and it will bring temp and it will bring hope and it will bring love amen that's why I say where can you buy all these only through trial when you have trials you are able to to receive the character and the virtues some will get stronger some will get weaker Dani Daniel Joseph and uh his friend Abraham during their trial they grew stronger but you will notice some people get weaker your weakness what is coming up tomorrow needs your strength today if you take your body and you misuse your body don't worry you will lose it if you play with your don't worry you lose if you play with your study you play with your job you will lose it you play with your money it will go away amen so how do you handle the you must keep the faith the faith in God meaning looking at what God say speak what God spoke repeat what God already say apply the word of God in other word make God talk you are facing a you're facing a situation like job repeat the word I know that my redeemer leaveth amen amen I know that my redeemer leaveth and God why does he bring all these test it's to make sure that when he's not or wherever he send you will defend him with honor amen amen so before he trust you with something you got to go to trial and it's not one it's not just we saw Joseph test after test trial after and at the end God blessed and everybody that went through was blessed there are many things we leave it God knows everything I want to speak about the season because I said that the a test is a season and during season there are people when they reach their season of blessing they forget the weaknesses amen amen as I spoke one time you were praying God God Gave You marriage God gave you your job you have it now you begin to get busy with those you don't come to church you don't want to be closer but look at the secret we read PSM 127 verse one it's God who bring the blessing when you sleep and you don't push too much effort look at the life of Jacob he was T it's not that was very bad was doing that was bad but look at the difference Jacob always close to when need water he bring water he used to talk to Mama too much you would notice in every relationship when you don't talk to somebody distance that come and then you begin to forget things even in marriage when you don't commune in marriage the devil get in between and notice now our beloved Jacob he always talked to Mama because he was in fellowship with Mama that's why Mama did what she did can you believe from the same womb two Nations trouble by the same mother one mother why Jacob always close to M and his mother prot he didn't have to make many he didn't have to cook any to get his Blessing to get the mama was there for because he always Clos with it's like a child of God when you always in prayer in fellowship with God can you imagine when you are fellowshipping with God you are always in God all the time in contact with God God will open the ways God will be with you God will open the doors the windows of Heaven to bless you that's why the children of God don't don't don't make a lot of effort because God is the one in charge it's God who's watching over the city he he doesn't sleep he doesn't SL the one who watches and that's the God and he will keep you he will keep you at work at school he will give you a promotion he will protect you everywhere he will hear you for all diseases tonight no matter your situation we saw God left the three Hebrew like
