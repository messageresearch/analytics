usually I have my camera torso and I like to always double check whenever I'm getting out of car before I do anything so I got out the car I'm pretty sure I had my key when it was time to go home I was with my friend and after that I looked I didn't have my key with me so the first thing that came to mind I told I was like God please let it not be inside so I want her to go back one my friend looked shocked the other one was laughing and a lot of thoughts start running to my mind I was like my dad would be mad if I have to call him because I don't have the key and stuff like that and I started reviewing my day like where must I have been that I don't know where my body just started walking towards the car and after automatically I opened the door after I saw the kid was in there so I thank God because I found my key as for the praise report there's a sister that I work with Miss kadian and her daughter Madison and a friend of mine that uh put a prayer request the other day Frank

father there is more blessing than the challenges and the trials and through it all Lord father we have an expected end and we end up Victorious father you know how the devil has been attacking this service tonight but if we stand here again Lord father we are outstanding as trophies of your victory and your mercy tonight Lord because without it we could not be able Lord father to be standing in that presence that's why we are humbling ourselves Lord father remembering that Lord we are human being we are created Lord father to be a tool of worship into that hand Lord you know our limitation because you spoke in your word that there is nothing that we can do without you lord father that's why we are surrendering ourselves that you move us completely out of the way may you take this

Christ amen thank you musician God richly bless you that be all for the music amen everybody happy tonight amen it looks like the way the channel we broke into it upset the devil pretty much he doesn't like it meaning somebody's getting blessed amen glory to God we greet you all in the precious name of our Lord Jesus Christ both visible and invisible audience amen my sound is good praise God if there is any family members here we do not have visitors we only have family members God richly bless you I believe everybody is up to date with the sermon and everybody are reading the scripture the Cod the seals the church ages question and answer and everything in other words you have your head in the word Father Brown I'm saying put your head in the word amen let's go straight to our scripture I'm going to use the same scripture we used last time try to approach this as a Sunday School I have my question and answer Bible so let's go slowly amen amen second Chronicle chapter 7. if you dare it you can say Amen glory to God second Chronicle chapter seven verse 14. amen you there the Bible says if my people we know who is the people of God now because we were not his people but there is a promise that he spoke that we will be called his people because the Jews rejected him now we become not only the People by the blood of God Amen If my people which are called by my name shall humble themselves amen and do water and pray and seek my face so in prayer you are seeking the face you might be seated if we humble ourselves amen if we humble ourselves and pray Amen in the prayer we are seeking for somebody you are not seeking for me in prayer you're not seeking for a prophet we are seeking for the face amen the face of God amen and seek my face what are you going to do with the face of God amen and seek my face and turn from their Wicked Ways then will I hear from where Heaven you remember that right we are aware on the earth and we're trying to communicate with Heaven amen so somebody is on Earth you remember this is pretty good amen you're trying to make a contact with somebody who is in heaven and the one who is in heaven is our father you remember that right Our Father amen I will hear from heaven and out and will forgive their sin and will heal their land so somebody have done something wrong and is in trouble so they are seeking God to intervene so they reach out to God through prayer and God will answer answering by fulfilling their desire amen praise God verse 15 now manize shall be open and man ear attend unto the prayer that is made in this place amen amen that place you know where it is amen let me call this church this place amen it depends on what you're looking at let's go to First Timothy chapter two that was the Temple of Solomon this church doesn't belong to a man he belongs to God ah man amen First Timothy chapter 2 verse 8 if you dare you can say Amen glory to God I will therefore that man pray away everywhere you understand this right now you can pray everywhere they didn't hear they say pray only in church all pray at home I'm sorry all pray in the closet those are places but you can pray everywhere even when you're fishing you can pray when you're driving you can pray I wish that man prays everywhere lifting up holy hands with a rough and water doubting prayer cannot be coupled with rough if you're angry we talk about it stay away and you cannot be in prayer with what without doubting the opposite of doubting is what believing which is faith you remember Sunday right glory to God so we must go in prayer how with faith if not you're wasting your time everybody okay last one James chapter 5. and then we start James 5 verse 14 Hallelujah you there is any sick among you let him call the Elders of the church and let them pray over him anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord that's a symbol amen and the prayer of water the faith so when you pray for somebody you don't pray as a formality sir you must pray the prayer of faith amen you must believe what you're trying to do anyway we will get to that amen the prayer of faith it's rather pray and faith shall save the sick and the Lord shall raise him up so we pray and God is doing the work amen amen and if he has committed sins they shall be have forgiven him all of this by prayer you can reach everything amen verse 16 confess your fault one to another and pray one for another that he may be how healed we want to see healing what do we need to do pray is it complicated the effectual fervent prayer affection then fervent amen prayer not just pray fervent prayer what does he mean an affection of fervent prayer of a righteous man a valid match when they say righteous man usually we have a tendency to see that ah a man who's perfect nothing wrong with it look at the next verse now God balances you back because if you continue with your righteousness you will begin to think that the only way you can pray and your prayer being so you must be perfect a certain way now God is correcting or balancing that in verse 17 he say Elias which is Elijah was a man subject to like passions as we are he was a human being and he pray how earnestly not just pray earnestly amen amen pray endlessly amen that it might not Reign and it ran not so in other words his prayer worked on the Earth by a space of three years and how many months six months and he Pray Again he looks like Elias in the old what he was doing he know how to lock and unlock something amen but he was just like me and you [Music] what was going on with Elijah amen and he prayed again and the heaven gave rain and the Earth brought forth her fruit so if Elijah is there the weather people will be in trouble they can predict whatever they want if Elijah pray your way they changed everybody okay amen all that Elijah uses prayer amen you want to change the heaven prayer you want to lock the Heaven prayer you want to open the Heaven prayer is it complicated let's pray again Heavenly Father Lord we are approaching you again humbly tonight father we thank you for your grace you love your mercy and forgiving us even the ability to be able to touch the Holy Scripture and to read them and today to understand them by Lord the help of the Holy Spirit father I have done what I can do as a human being now may you come and speak and teach us again hard to pray Lord father we humbly commit everything unto that hand be the beginning and the end in the name of Jesus Christ amen when we spoke about the subject of prayer amen we found out that prayer brother Branham say he was the most powerful weapon that God put in the hands of believer amen amen and we found out that we are on this Earth here waiting for our Redemption to go to heaven and for some reason we don't see God as a human being amen unless the Lord open your eyes so you can see him but we know that God is there amen and in order to communicate with God or in order to leave this earth and to get into heaven and bring our petition we use this uh telephone call prayer do you know that prayer is a telephone amen amen let's go to Jeremiah 33 as we're climbing now you need to keep your Bible because we are teaching on prayer let's go to Jeremiah 33 brother Caleb you can search please for Spiritual telephone Jeremiah 33 if you dare you can say Amen verse 3 you dare my friend no chat go ahead Jeremiah 33. if you go through the prophet Isaiah after Isaiah Jeremiah 33 verse 3 the Bible say call unto me am I reading a different Bible in other words make a phone call amen amen you must have a personal cell phone [Applause] everybody okay almost everybody here have a cell phone that you use to communicate with your parents to communicate with your friend to communicate with work and everything amen God also gave you a cell phone amen everybody okay and with that cell phone you can call him amen remember prayer is a back and forth amen prayer is a communion everybody okay you don't call a dead company okay everybody okay you don't call people that are buried in the cemetery because they won't answer amen cell phone is for leaving people [Applause] everybody okay everybody okay glory to God the Bible said call unto me so God expects you to call him God expect your phone call that's fine call unto me and I will do whatever answer thee and surely great and mighty thing which that no Western not so there are things you don't know [Applause] not small thing great things you don't know if you want to know it take a phone call and call your father because he's your father amen so prayer is your telephone [Applause] in the message water from The Rock it's there on the pulpit in 1955. brother Branham says this he says oh beloved God we come to the most humbly father in the name of the Lord Jesus to ask first I will deal with this down the road to forgive us of our sins and errors there is a reason why this need to be first but I won't touch it today because in the prayer of Jesus Christ it's down we will see why does it move from the bottom to the top everybody okay he says and we are so happy to know that we have a high priest setting in glory who can be touched by the feeling of our infirmities believing this believing what that he is Clan the rampered of Glory saving way high and exalted above every angel Archangel and Way Beyond Moon Star and sun and he does what he hears the prayer of everyone that shall come humbly asking amen this great telephone connection brother Robert you can print out the uh quote to give to my brother or you can go into the streaming when brother Caleb is pulling up so you can read it with me brother Branham say he hears the prayer of everyone that shall come humbly asking this great telephone connection we have as he were taking down the receiver calling Sancho comma Christ Jesus asking to be plugged into eternity [Applause] so prayer is a telephone it's a telephone that you used to call the central class Jesus which is our father because on Sunday me and my father we are so we call our father and get connected to Eternity amen everybody okay amen call unto me and I will answer how do you call him you call him by prayer everybody okay prayer is very important before you make any decision fun decision my brother glory to God amen you bear with me if I stay to put this on uh on a slide it would take me forever amen let me say a way of communication before making decision in the message the prophet Elisha brother Branham says this in paragraph 10 he say sometime we go off on a tantrum somewhere and not think about God not pray over it ask the Lord whether we should do it or not and find out that our supplier of blessing is cut off in other words we wake up when something is blocked we rush into doing something without praying when it's blocked that's when we remember did we ask God whether we need to do this or not brother Branham say then we wonder sometime well wonder why I can't have no more blessings you don't watch you let down in your prayer life you say well I'm a Christian well that's the more sun you should pray more than ever read the Bible every day pray every day you cannot have one day pass without you praying [Applause] a Christian prays every day and he prays everywhere [Applause] you can never pray too much brother Branham said we can talk too much we can sing too much we can do everything too much but never pray brother Branham continue he say don't make any decision too harshly all too quickly with our first considering God a body ask him shall I do this father ask him is it your will for me to do this then see what the holy spirit will speak to you he might not give you a vision but he will speak in some way to you you remember in question and answer somebody asked a question how do we know that God how God speak and I answer that question if you were not there you ask those that were there amen he said then see what the holy spirit will speak to you he might not give you a vision but he will speak in some way to you to let you know if you shall be sincere and ask him so prayer is your telephone do not move without calling Jesus and ask him what do you what am I supposed to do should I do this or not the problem is you don't even believe that God will answer if we praying just because we were taught to pray in other words what we do is I want to go somewhere we send her or sit down and pray Lord Jesus Christ I want to know your will but there is no will you are waiting you already know your will your wave you want to go to me not to you you are stupid everybody okay that's the way we do Lord Jesus Christ I'm trying to travel this way and when we finish we say I prayed about it we buy the ticket and we go amen because you're doing what you want to do when you went to prayer you didn't even believe somebody would tell you yes or no you already have your plan you are praying just because you were told to do so so you can cover your conscience that when I'm going in this place when I'm eating when I'm doing whatever I want to do when I'm engaging into this I already prayed about it okay you prayed about it what did God say about it everybody okay because because prayer is a communion you need to hear from somebody back and forth everybody okay so you don't make a decision without prayer let me read something about brother Brown I'm here bear with me as I'm going slowly glory to God brother Caleb he says God always answers prayers in the message here ye him brother Branham say we are not on that subject we are just backgrounding a little get the fear away don't be scared that God is not going to answer prayer God always answer his prayer God always sends us prayers and we explain in question and answer that's the problem is we don't know how God speak back and already answered that amen but God answer a prayer always brother Branham say that their work is already finished he is obligated he must do it he's got to do it to keep his word notice it is a finished way so every prayer must have an answer amen amen amen you reach a point where your faith need to be alive or if you don't have faith you need to seek the Holy Ghost because we can't fool the devil anymore we're not doing religion religion is things that you do in in uh in as a routine but there is no life you can talk about the angel but you don't even believe yourself that there is an angel you don't even believe that one day you will see one that's religion this church is not religion no sir whatever we preach here we must partake it [Applause] we must experience what we are preaching amen because Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and water forever my God is not dead also my God is alive [Applause] let's go to Hebrew 11. glory to God Hallelujah message believer the law of religion yeah the law of religion that's why they get off the message they begin to take what they thought was religion because that's what they thought that being in a message meaning below wear long dresses do this do that's part of the message but the message is more than that you are wearing that as a result of a life that is in you if you don't have that life you quit this message that's why you're wearing your your dresses are changing because you were doing that for religion let's go to Hebrew chapter 11. now we start climbing glory to God if you dare you can say Amen you understand this very well right let's go to verse six very simple let's go but without water faith it is how impossible to do whatever please God with that faith it is how impossible what does impossible means it cannot happen now my question is if you don't have faith what can you get from God I'm reading the scripture am I reading a different Bible the Bible said we got faith it's what impossible there is no way around if there is no faith amen it is impossible to please God so when you are approaching God in prayer doubting you are displeasing him it is better for you to go to sleep [Applause] oh my God impossible [Music] in other words not possible there is no possibility for you to please God everybody okay he said with that faith it is impossible to please him follow me carefully amen because we remember prayer brother Branham say it doesn't mean to bring God down you remember that it means taking men to the presence of God you remember that but when you go into his presence you must go a certain way you don't just go there if you don't have faith you might as well go back because you won't please him you ready verse 6 with our faith it is impossible to please him for he that cometh to God why are you coming to God you need something from God and the vehicle remember that take us to God is prayer the vehicle that take us here unto the present remember job was praying that if I can find his place if I can talk to him you remember so the vehicle that take you from here to there is prayer so the Bible say with that faith it is impossible for you to please God we okay now and the Bible says that when you are coming before God amen God want to see two things are you ready the Bible said he that cometh to God must believe that he's so before you start praying you must believe that God exists you cannot believe this Bible as a stories everybody okay we we do things unconsciously when we pray we're praying like we're praying to somebody in the air that's what your conscience has amen that's the problem we have amen you are praying Lord Jesus but you know that this Lord Jesus is somebody that is somewhere and they told us he looks like this picture but God said when you approach him number one you must believe that he is we okay follow me you must believe that he is a man and that he is a water rewarder of those that do water diligently seek him so before you come to God you must carry Faith amen you must believe that I am going to see a being that is real because when you call he will answer it for you to believe that he can answer you must believe that he existed he is not a dead God he's a God that can talk he can he say God that can touch you [Applause] he said God that can appear to you so when you go into prayer you must expect anything from God [Applause] do you know what we do when we stop praying you pray you pray if you hear something moving what do you do you see you see because you don't expect anything to move you want to do your duty and come out but when you're praying just know that you are approaching a being and that being can react and I'm gonna show you soon everybody okay everybody okay everybody okay so before you go to prayer cool down a little bit don't just wake up and say I'm going to pray because you don't even know what you're doing before you pray slow down put your mind down a little bit and begin to think about him [Applause] [Music] everybody okay the same way brother Benjamin is approaching his father brother Mickey he's not approaching in the a being that they just told him he knows that his father is there and he knows that when he speak brother meet you will answer that's the way you answer that's the way you approach God [Applause] everybody okay everybody good so when you are approaching God you must first believe that the one I'm approaching is not a myth foreign cartoons it is not somebody that I read on Jehovah Witnesses stuff it is somebody that is real he's a human being he can talk he can write [Applause] [Music] and that person is also a rewarder of of the person who diligently seek him diligence he means you're gonna find a position [Music] Lord help me let me read this I don't have it there but a Caleb I have it I took a screenshot of it Lord help me if I can find it amen listen to brother Branham Hallelujah brother Branham said in the message perseverance you can put it down 63 11 16 in the evening paragraph 67. he said persevering now we know the word I think that it means to be persistent and persistent in something that you are doing in making a goal or something you have to be persistent and man through all ages that had faith in what they are trying to achieve had to be persistent especially if you're trying to do something right because you are going to meet an opposition when you trying to pray you will see the devil begin to throw things at you I don't know if you listen to me you can sit down and watch TV nothing happens you can talk on the phone nothing happened as soon as you decide that it's time to go to prayer suddenly the babies crying suddenly the telephone is ringing suddenly a DOT comes you need to do your dishes you forget the laundry thing because somebody knows what you're going to do [Applause] so to pray he's a fighter yes sir dress up everybody okay because you're trying to make connection with heaven [Applause] you can call the children you say time to pray this one is going to brush his teeth 20 minutes this one goes and do so and you just wonder what is going on because the devil doesn't like it you mentioned the word prayer because prayer if you remember that's where we send atomic bomb that's where we send our missiles that's where we destroy everything that was infiltrating into the house [Applause] that's where we begin to renew our connection back that's why we need to we we are detaching from the earth and begin to get into the supernatural everybody that have been a man of Faith must be persistent and when you are approaching God you must believe that first is not he is a God but he is a living being and he is a rewarder in other words he will reward you he will give you back what you want and he is a rewarder of those that diligently water so when you seek God you must have a reward that's why brother Branham say God always answers prayer [Applause] [Music] because when you go through prayer somebody have an answer somebody will reward you at the end and you can never approach god with a doubt that's why Paul said you can never pray doubting you must approach him by faith believing that he is and whatever I'm about to speak to him he is the one that can give me the solution amen that's why I'm approaching him if you don't believe that don't even pray everybody okay if you believe the bank will give you the solution just go to the bank [Music] everybody okay amen open James chapter one glory to God I know somebody is waiting for me to start that Kingdom Come hold on okay hold on we'll be there amen James chapter one if you're there you can say amen amen James chapter one glory to God job to verse 5. if you dare you can say Amen if any of you lack wisdom let him do what ask of God so if somebody doesn't have wisdom it is your own fault if you lack wisdom it is not your parent you need to ask God he gave it to Shadrach Meshach Abednego and Daniel so don't search for a family member who was dumb in school no everybody okay leave the family member alone everybody okay he said if any of you like wisdom let him do what ask God that giveth to some men no how liberally [Music] God gives how liberally liberally and not breaded water not and it shall be water given him because God always ensures prayers amen and he will give it to you freely in other word god have so much that he want to give away [Applause] the Earth belongs to him let me continue amen verse 6 but let him ask her in faith everybody good I know where what I'm drilling everybody okay so you don't just ask like that you must ask her in faith because with our faith it is impossible everybody okay so when you are approaching God make sure stop to yourself say Hey listen you want to talk to God right just know that if you are approaching make sure you you know what you're doing because you're going to get an answer if you're not sure you stay here until you're sure if not you want to waste your time and brag how you pray three hours because your problem is the exercise I'm gonna show you that if I can get to that and then James said but let him ask how in faith we already preach faith on Sunday comma nothing water wavering for he the weather is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and the water fast are we okay jump to verse 7 for let not Damon demand that is wavering the one the man that is approaching god with our faith without believing that he's and he is the one that's gonna give you your solution the man let that man think let not the man think that he shall receive water anything of the Lord possible amen so whatever you want to get from God you need selfie [Applause] everybody good job to verse uh eight for a double-minded man is how unstable in water all his way amen that is always doubting undecided he cannot take a decision he's saying something else but he's thinking something else [Applause] unstable unstable it won't work amen Pastor why are you talking about faith here with prayer why do we need to know that God exists why do we have to know that number one God is he exists amen and number two he's a rewarder of the one that is approaching him diligently amen why do we want to know that amen amen number one prayer take you to heaven you remember the quote amen when you go to heaven you are going to see somebody but you must believe that that person is a rewarder you're going to heaven is not literal [Music] because heaven is here you remember that only in a faster dimension amen it is a telephone that they're trying to hook you your Wi-Fi need to connect [Applause] are we okay so why do we need to know this go to James 4. now we're getting there amen James chapter 4. glory to God if you dare you can say Amen drop to verse 8 glory to God there we go amen Let me refresh this so it makes sense where I'm going brother Caleb can you get the definition before I get this so it will make sense not to make sense to your brand but make sense to your heart before somebody say listen he's telling the people making sense making sense we don't have to know we don't I know the message uh traditions and the old wolves and everything how they work amen are you there definition of prayer you there can you see that brother you can see that brother Branham say before we read that prayer is not exactly bringing God down to men you can see that there it is bringing Manuel up to God as you pray you lose sight of water these Earthly things so you live in Earth toward Heaven you sway out somewhere else Way Beyond and on and on until you be in the in in what his presence and then what faith you remember what I just spoke that you have laid out before God everybody clear everybody okay now watch why I say this in John number one you must believe that God exists number two he is the rewarder don't go to prayer with that Faith why because it's impossible James say if you are doubting you cannot receive anything from God because a double-minded and stable you're wasting God times God comes you look at your mind he say that's fine he keeps doing what he got to do and he needs to find somebody else in spoken word who have faith everybody okay everybody okay now why are you saying this pastor James chapter 4 verse 8. you there Jonah unto who God We join I by prayer everybody okay Jonah unto God comma and he will do utter draw nigh to you so when you are approaching God God won't stay quiet no sir [Applause] when you are approaching God there will be a reaction back amen that's what we are afraid of it when you hear something in the room so why did you approach him why did you approach him you wanted to talk to him Lord of Abraham Lord of Isaac and then did somebody open the door you don't know what you're doing [Music] everybody okay everybody okay when you approach God you're gonna receive a reaction amen are you following me he said John 9 unto me to the Lord and He will join now unto who you cleanse your hand but we'll see that later yes Sinners and purify your heart ye water double-minded because you won't receive anything [Music] you are stable amen but what I'm trying to draw here when you are approaching God In Prayer God will react back amen everybody okay why are you saying that amen you are approaching God God will react why are you saying that Jesus say our father I'm Ben which are in heaven you remember that Halloween you already remember that right now what comes Hallowed be thy name what started we already finished that one we already done that checked number two check where are we now thy kingdom come thy kingdom come the kingdom of who God what is the kingdom of God we already seen it what is it holy ghost are you up to date to the sermon with the sermon the kingdom of God is what the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost so when you start your prayer Our Father which are in heaven everybody okay Hallowed be thy name you begin to worship Him you remember we went through that and in your worship you must welcome his kingdom everybody okay everybody okay you because as you are approaching him he is going to react everybody okay so as he's reacting you must welcome him that Kingdom in other words I want your spirit to come why do you want his Spirit to come why let's stop right here that Kingdom Come and the kingdom of God is the Holy Ghost why do you want the Holy Ghost to come in your prayer amen Our Father which are in heaven Lord I love you Hallowed be thy name and God say put the dark kingdom come wish for his kingdom to come amen Express the desire for him to come he will come but you must make him welcome everybody okay as he's coming to your core as he's answering your car you need to make him welcome you need to tell him how are you doing today how was your day today are you doing okay I was thinking about you and I want to hear from you [Music] [Applause] [Music] make him welcome everybody okay everybody okay why is this important why why is this important listen to brother Branham when he says that Kingdom Come Lord help me buddy Caleb found that Kingdom Come please it's going to be toward the end amen in the message souls in prison in 1963 paragraph 405. brother Branham say what was that Fellowship of Kindred mans that Kingdom Come Thou will be done see we try to make God a mascot boy I won't get to that yet or something God do this do that Jesus say you got it pray that Kingdom Come thou will be done in earth as it is where in Heaven by the bottom explain then Heaven is brought down to us somebody reacted and we are brought up to heaven you went to God God is reacting and we are sitting in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus so as you are doing that to God God will react back to you but you must be not afraid he's not a spook when you see me walking on the water don't start screaming oh it's a ghost it's a ghost it is the very thing that is coming to save you because you are screaming over there Lord we dying and here Jesus coming and you look you say no that's a ghost when Jesus resurrected he appeared to them they say stand back it's a ghost everybody okay we are afraid of the supernatural that's what I'm trying to say that's what I'm trying to say open your mind to the supernatural when you are approaching God you are approaching a supernatural God Amen God will react but you must welcome his phrases [Applause] [Music] aren't you tired of praying praying praying praying 20 years and you're the only one praying and you stand up and you go if they ask you a question have you ever hear God you will see how you're gonna do ah why do you ask me that question no because you don't want to answer it you don't want to tell the truth that you never heard God because somebody put you at the corner we talk so much about the supernatural in the message and we know very little about the supernatural we're using more our brain to solve our issue and we don't understand what we're doing that kingdom come we want your Holy Ghost to come why open First Corinthians 14. glory to God amen are we together First Corinthians 14. if you dare you can say Amen somebody tired okay you dare you can say amen amen jump to verse 15. you there what is it then you

brother because when I say that somebody will will say what are you talking about let's go where it says sincerity my brother you need to go back to the beginning where it's definition after the finishing it says sincerity in the message Prada Branham says this in paragraph 44. you say pray the prayers oh I hate that pharisaic thing or you pray and make every Karma just perfect if you find that you can put it there my friend everybody okay and every period you find it can we read it together my friend you got it yeah sincerity let's start you say pretty prayer oh I hate that water very sick thing you pray and make every Karma how just perfect every period house just perfect oh you pray so welcome beautiful you can't talk to God like that no sir no sir heavenly father in our perspective today who are you trying to impress who make the Damned to speak who is the god of the language who is the god of the speaking in tongue what are you trying to impress him you know technically speaking technically what do you think I will sit with God and I say the doctor says that in the next hour when you go to The ventricle for what who created the human being you telling who what he knows more than your doctor what are you trying to tell him he is the great physician [Applause] cannot continue can I continue stop being a Pharisee especially when you know somebody is beside you they call you to pray for the food you try to impress people what are you trying to impress the people they charge you to pray for the food [Music] because in your mind uh yeah it's our bread and here and preacher so let me prepare my coat very good you praying to people they tell you here pray for the prayer request go straight to the prayer request and stop brother Branham say don't get here and stop praying for the mayor of the city so the people will see that you a big humanistic man you more than Bill Gates philanthropic you love the mayor of the city is that what we told you to do here we gave you five prayer request pray about the prayer request and the Hand thou self and stop your prayers cannot continue teach us how to pray glory to God brother Branham saying you can't talk to God like that you are listening to what you are saying and doing water punctuating your prayer that's why you make a mess you correct your error foreign [Laughter] can I read it oh God do what help you help you do what to turn loose one once and do what and pray stop saying water prayers stop saying prayer but you need to make prayer amen [Applause] teach us how to pray when we approach God we usually approach him we pray how understanding understanding meaning you are the one on the pilot you are the one on the steering wheel you the one that is guiding this thing Brothers even say we start our Father which are in heaven Hallowed be thy name so it's time for me to start praising him that's okay you need to pray also with understanding and then the scripture will come the Lord say whoever approaches me where two or three are Gather in my name you are the one moving the ship no problem but Paul say pray also in the water spirit the spirit you must welcome him amen okay okay everybody okay that's why when you pray Our Father which are in heaven you the one doing the talking Hallowed be the name you the one expressing your heart to him but after a while you need to switch to automatic palette [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] this one is a manual control this one is other [Music] everybody okay everybody okay so when you start seeing your will after a while you need to get the cruise control on Our Father which are in heaven you're the one saying I'm your I'm your son I'm approaching you I want to talk to you this this this this this Lord I worship you Lord you the king of King you the Lord of Lord you the Mighty God you're the one that resurrected the third day you're the one that defeated death you are repeating you are remembering all the good stuff that you want to tell him you hear me for this you did this you did this for sister of course you did this father you can do all of that and after a while you need to let him that that Kingdom in either way take over this ship take over the ship take over this ship until another pilot comes when that pilot come he will move you away and he take the ship and you can relax let's go to Roman 8. you see one word what he does let's go to Roman 8. Our Father which are in heaven Hallowed be the name thy kingdom come we want his kingdom to come why do we want his kingdom to come we started our prayer with understanding it's okay but Paul said pray also in the water spirit in the spirit it is not you praying it is the holy spirit praying [Music] why do we need the spirit of the Lord to pray why do we need the spirit of God to pray let me read brother Brana brother uh Caleb please let's go to uh praise be to the name of the Lord let's go to atmosphere and in the spirit the kingdom of God is the Holy Ghost you are welcoming his Spirit you are calling on him to come and take over this prayer why you there in the message the Patmos Vision preaching UH 60 December 4th brother Branham says this he says now you can't do any good until first you get in the spirit God can use you all your effort are in vain until first you do it in the spirit can I continue if I will sing I will sing in the spirit this is if I shall pray say Paul I shall pray in the spirit I'm reading brother Brown they're going to put it in now it's atmosphere and in the spirit and then if there is anything that comes to me that is any good it has to be revealed to me by the spirit and confirmed by the word made manifest by the result he bears why do we want the spirit to get there brother Branham is explaining us in the message the exposition of the church brother Branham says this mine I love that he was talking about John being I was in the spirit in the Lord's day you remember that in the Book of Revelation 1 10 I was in the spirit in the Lord's day brother is explaining that he said my I love that you could just call those words the whole of a Christian Life this word I'm saying we can call this the whole of a Christian Life if we are going to live as a Christian we have to be in his spirit John was not talking about being in his own spirit that's your own understanding that would not have brought this vision he had to be the spirit of God so brother Branham is saying here when you break into the automatic the spirit realm this is where the supernatural opener this is where you can see a vision this is where you can hear God talking this is where you are aware that you are not alone in the room like another being have just came in he changes your prayer because you're using a different deal have I lost anyone brother Branham say John was not talking about being in his own spirit that would not have brought this Vision he had to be the spirit of God he has to be the spirit of God with us too or all our efforts are in vain Paul say I will pray in the spirit I will sing in the spirit I will live in the spirit if there is anything good that will come to me he has to be revealed by the spirit confirmed by the word and made manifest by this by the result he Bears what does he mean praying in the spirit in the message is there anything too hard for the Lord paragraph 10 brother Branham say then I climb up a little father into the thicket and I knelt down and the mosquitoes were just Hamming all around my ear you know when you're trying to pray I just addressed I already addressed that and I couldn't hardly pray and I believe then it was the devil he must shock you but I'm gonna say it the devil can use your normal family routine to block you from praying [Applause] everybody okay brother Branham children sometimes were getting upset and begin to argue one another and brother Branham saying was the devil doing that just to upset brother Branham because he knows if brother Branham get consecrated he's gonna get something so you need to learn this you need to have discernment to see what is normal and what is not normal brother Branham had a child that was praying all the time I mean crying all the time turn around the baby cry cry cry cry and brother Branham thought he was normal until one day the Holy Spirit say hey wake up it's the devil traveling your ministry it was Sarah brother I'm calling his wife he said bring the baby here he rebuked the spirit brother random say Sarah become the meekest of all his children so what you think what you think is normal sometimes it's not normal why all this question when I'm about to pray why you didn't tell me your problem only when I'm about to pray why are you bringing them now daddy look at this daddy look at this daddy look at this uh you know what is going on wait a minute let me pray first then I'll come back because once you get sucked into the sea before you know it it's time to go to bed you gotta work tomorrow you know what I'm saying don't say Amen I'm gonna say Amen [Applause] because me and you are living in this world so I know what is going on amen you take a phone call you say no no okay I'm gonna talk to her five minutes then I'm gonna go to pray you will see what is gonna happen when she called you a beautiful story did you know and then before you know it two hours you look it's time to go to bed what do we do Lord Jesus uh protect me protect my children bless me in the name of Jesus Christ amen you got a hand towards slip your one hour was he talking with your friend because you don't know how to discern the devil everybody okay that's why I learned how to take phone call and manage them I say I see your phone call I see your message I won't answer you now I say father whatever they're going through please may you assist them but I have to do what I have to do because you're expecting me in the morning to give you what you want if I continue to be on the phone all the time what am I gonna do and in the morning you are looking at me like Bring it on Bring it on so I have to learn how to push the breakfast I cannot be in every invitation if you come into a wedding I cannot stay all the way until you close the door because I'm a pastor [Applause] I'm gonna be in your wedding for a few times after a few hours I must leave because I get a commission you gotta know who you are what are you doing amen you got a responsibility in the church and you stay until 3M [Applause] [Music] [Applause] you guys you're coming to church every day late not because of the children you the one causing all of that when people begin to go you say are you going only right now the party just started so me and you we party together you continue with your body me I have stuff to do I respected the invitation but I have to budget my time can I continue I don't know how I sleep up into this somebody pulling everybody okay everybody okay so you have to learn how to be disciplined we're going to visit somebody how many hours no you stay there seven hours and before you come back a bill it was lost you didn't pay for it because you always too busy and things are going there and late fee twenty dollars you're the one that cost your family twenty dollars off you could have purchased milk because you're too busy amen twenty dollars is nothing for you you make a lot of money so that's fine God be merciful and just throw up my hands and stop praying anyhow and just let the mosquitoes feel up if they wish to but there was something that was burned burdening in my heart and after I become so lost in prayer follow me carefully I guess you Christian knows what it means to be lost in prayer just Forget Where You Are you are an automatic pilot Daddy's praying in the spirit I believe [Applause] when was the last time you were lost in prayer everybody okay brother Branham say and I open my eyes and just sad of a little Dogwood Bush there was that light hanging because this man already came in when you are lost in the spirit he opened the door to the supernatural then the pillar of fire was there when brother Branham opened his eyes he doesn't remember which time he was he doesn't how many times we preach here on Sunday and you and you come out you say wow because you were in another realm where time doesn't affect you anymore the one who's looking at his clock anytime he's the one chasing the time because he's done here he's in understanding in manual the other one said Keep moving keep moving keep moving because the word is taking him he's not even hungry as soon as he came out of there then he said okay it's time to go did something big because you came down you come down from your mind from automatic to manual some people they get in church they are menu from start to finish looking at the clock looking at the clock looking at the club because they have many programs let the Holy Ghost hit you one day [Applause] and you start speaking in tongue I will carry you to your car speaking in tongue and put you in your car and say go to the restaurant again [Music] everybody okay everybody okay so why do we need this automatic because when the spirit comes he opened the door to the water to the vision for you to hear things for you to see things for you to be aware of things that's why we welcome his kingdom now let's go to Romans 8. where am I at my garden oh gotta stop let's go to Roman 8. let's go to Roman 8. if you dare you can say Amen why do we want to switch gear from manual to automatic power I'm saying this so you understand since you're born in the age of Technology and you are living there amen if you dare you can say amen amen Romans 8 verse 26 let's go my brother likewise the water spirit also do what helpeth our infirmity stop the Holy Spirit does what help us you are spinning around oh the king of King the Lord of Lord the glory oh the consulate the Mighty God the prince of him sooner you're going to run out of tattle I'm a real Pastor I'm not fake okay I'm a real person okay and I'm not I don't have time for fake stuff okay the sooner you're gonna run out okay you need the pilot you need the automatic Palace to help you up to lift you up to welcome he says if you welcoming me okay I'm here also in other words you are opening your arm and somebody come and hug you and say I'm there amen you my son don't worry I'm here amen amen you want something let me help you ask these things to God let me read it we want your prayer to be effective amen you come out a prayer and something happened you come out a prayer in something like that like Elijah it was a man of like passion he was praying and things happen the disciples look at Jesus they say your way of praying he said teach us how to pray show us the keys of Prayer so that we can be like you when we're going throughout the day we don't pray long anymore because our sword is sharp prayer sharpen your soul somebody sold his door no prayer they might be sharp in politics you open politics you're gonna hear them they know everything whoever does it let's go my friend so likewise the spirit also the water help with our infirmities for we know nothing that's good it's a freedom Mama we know what what we should pray for actually the Lord the Lord that to remind me of scripture I'm going to give it to you he said for we know not what we should water pray for as we are reach brother we okay but the water spirit itself with water making intercessions for us which cannot be water and he's the daughter searches the hearts knoweth what is in the mind of the water the spirit because he make intercession for who the Saints according to water the will of God [Applause] [Music] the Holy Spirit man of God spoke by the Holy Ghost amen the one who spoke the Bible is the holy spirit he knows what he done he knows what how how he put his word so when you are calling on him that Kingdom Come when he cometh he picks you up and begin to help you up suddenly you pray and you begin to feel like scripture are coming brother brand I'm saying that somebody's pulling scripture if you're a preacher it tells you go get your book uh I'm in pen quickly get your message quickly why because you already broke into the supernatural if it's something you are asking he's giving you a scripture remember I am the Lord who did this who did this who did this because where the spirit of the Lord is there is the spirit of the Lord how because the spirit knows the will of God why is it important that the spirit stay with the will of God do you know why I'm going to stop here let's go to first John 5. I believe that is it I wrote so many things that I would get into it okay I love it amazing let's go to First John chapter 5. so it's a teaching in prayer first John chapter 5 if you dare you can say amen amen go to verse 15 my friend amen if by any chance you found those quotes you can just put it up so whoever you want to get them can get them later if not I will get an email or somebody is asking for it maybe he or any national so amen I know what I'm talking about amen you there you there John 2 verse 14. read it my friend and this is the water confidence that we have where in him if we ask him what anything did he block something did he tell us what not to ask there you ask what anything you ask water even these glasses you can ask him for you can ask him for this guitar anything you can ask him for the puppet if I tell you the story of this puppet it's a miracle everybody okay if we ask for anything amen you there according to what his will so you must ask how according to his will but when the Holy Spirit Come he help you how according to the water will of God because the spirit is God he is the one that wrote the Bible amen he will never deviate from the will of God in other words why you are missing on your imperfection or prayer the Holy Spirit can redirect you and say God this way lock God here everybody okay do you remember the woman we finish your blood no scripture the Holy Spirit told her go ahead and touch over there and if you notice in the scripture later on people begin to do that it's written in the Bible they begin to do the same thing like the woman of the issue of blood and they begin to get here send me a text I'll send you this picture everybody okay why because somebody started and when God uh I mean answer one person it's a that's it it becomes his word amen if if God does something to you the word of God is not limited to this because there are many things that Jesus have done that was not so if God does something for you I can come back and use you and begin to claim it to God [Applause] this is Abraham you are my Abraham today the Abraham was just like brothers Charles the Abraham were reading in the Bible it is God in his human being Jesus Christ [Music] let's go he said according to his will he hear us verse 15 and if we know that he hear us whatsoever we ask we know that we have what the petition that we do it desire we must ask according to his will and when the spirit come he asked our petition how let's go back to Roman 8. and I stop here I'm trying to nail this praying in the spirit Romans 8 again my friend let's nail this so if you go home you go home with this you there amen go back to verse 26 again you can read it go ahead my friend I have many things to say and to judge of you no Romans 8 26 likewise the spirit also helpeth our infirmities for we know not what we should pray for us we are this is our understanding but the spirit itself makeeth what in recession for who us with water which cannot be water utter so sometimes he can use a tongue you don't understand everybody okay and he that search of the water know if what is in the mind of the water searches because he makeeth intercession for who according to the will of who God because whatever you ask according to his will God must give you because God always assures prayer when you pray Our Father which are in heaven Hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come next time thou will be done because if I get to that it's another hour you must welcome the Holy Spirit we cannot be afraid of the spirit of God the spirit of God is Not spoke it's not Halloween that's a perversion of it it's a holy spirit it's a real God amen the Inside Man is a supernatural being amen you need to get into a real relationship with God where God is real where you can sit and say somebody was talking to me I heard somebody tell me something I was wondering about something and a thought came and said don't worry you want to have that you don't need anybody to tell you anything that's the best friend that will stick with you anytime when everybody else don't want to talk to you that one is always there when you're going to trial that's the best friend that will come sometimes he can use the preacher and the preacher says something that you know nobody knew except you and God you will know that it's him responding back to you remember we talk about it in question and answer sometimes he can use this he can use this he can use he can use anything to speak to you we want to be in the spirit because when you are in the spirit that's when God become real that's when this message is no longer Just Books and tape the message become a living person amen and you're going to begin to have experience for yourself and those experience will solidify your faith that you know for sure that I have somebody backing me up I have a rock that is following me if something happened I can call on him if I'm going through difficulty and if I get to prayer really down I know he's going to speak back to me and when he speak you don't argue you don't push you don't do anything you say it's your command I got it this is what I need to do period that's what we want not guessing opening the Bible maybe this is what he said Open Bible if it's a verse you don't like ah not to the curses you open the Bible again you see that you see how how is he knowing that do you think it's me telling you how does he know you that that is he sees what you are doing you were guessing at him if it's a good subject you say oh this is the this is the subject this is the chapter of the day this is the verse of my day today you are happy if you open Islam again you're a movie you say ah this is Daniel Daniel is a lot of vision I'm not gonna get dead because you are looking for his uh for Isaiah for somewhere to tell you you are my God you are my children call on me I will answer you want that fresh in the morning so you can start the day begin to play guess those Romans 8 those that are the children of God are led by the what spirit of God our Father which are in heaven Hallowed be thy name that kingdom come we want your kingdom to come we want your presence to come we are welcoming you we want you to come and take over our prayer help us where we don't know how to pray amen teach us how to pray take this ship and move it because I pray for this child a long time I don't know what I don't I don't I don't even know again how to pray anymore I don't know which scripture to use letting me use that scripture it is not the length of prayer I can't get to that yet if you want to approach him remember that he is and he is the rewarder or those that diligently seek him ask him without doubting if you wave he can't give you anything because he operate by the law the law that he operate why is faith let's bow ahead Heavenly Father Lord once again we are approaching you humbly tonight father we thank you for your grace and we thank you for the moving of the Holy Spirit because now the more we dive into this we begin to see how important it is to have your spirit because without your spirit there is nothing we can do Lord no wonder you say seek ye first the kingdom of God something that we need to cherish something that we love something that we welcome because you spoke to us that our kingdom is not of this world it is a different Kingdom you even told the disciple that if he was either disciple and you'd spoke to pilate you say if my kingdom was of this world my servant would have fight for me you know which kingdom you were in and we came from that Kingdom that's the kingdom we want that you say the kingdom of God is within you father may you help our prayer life may you come and remove all hypocrisy all saying and pharisaic praying may you remove it from us father may you help us budget our time may you help us discern the attack of the enemy against this great weapon and the great key that you put in the hand of your children so that they understand that prayer is very very it's a great value and we can never neglect it that you spoke to us a month ago that he comes first and everything else should be secondary father they are people that I work and that wanted to be here but Lord because of their work schedule they could not make it but I pray that you helped them and open the way so that they can be in service in the midweek there are some that the devil have overtaken Lord that any slight reason they can stay home because there is a streaming now because they can follow later because something else was value before your services until they lost their zeal of the services and this continue to affect their life and they are fighting humanly speaking but I pray as a shepherd that should be merciful to them that you give them a wake-up call so that they understand that it's very important to be in the presence of the Lord to budget our time to organize our life so that we make sure that we give you the first place because time is running very fast and soon whatever we're trying to put first will remain in this world it will be under the kingdom of the Antichrist and in a three and a half years everything will be destroyed and become ashes and this entire civilization whatever we have accomplished in this world will be destroyed completely and we will be looking at a new city with new homes that will be coming down from heaven that will be the Eternal City that will remain forever father you are blessing us like you spoke to us that you want us to be blessed spiritually physically materially in every aspect of our life as our soul prosper father the prospering of the Soul goes with a deep prayer life may you help each one of us Lord in our prayer life Lord that we realize how important it is to give Lord father the preeminence to our prayer life and to the things of the Kingdom bless your children that went a little bit beyond Lord Father Tom to give us Lord this opportunity to be able to deliver this message so that now we understand the importance of your spirit because we have been on a manual control for a long time but father help us to understand how to surrender how to make way for the spirit how to switch quickly so that we can have prayer that will bring results on Upon Our Life upon our families upon our children upon our marriages upon our businesses upon the church upon our health and upon everything we're doing we thank you and committed unto that hand father touch each one that is here that is sick tonight that is
