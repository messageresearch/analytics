[0:08] [music]
[0:17] We had our young sisters meeting
[0:21] 4 hours meeting.
[0:23] [laughter]
[0:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[0:26] &gt;&gt; This is the first meeting that we have
[0:28] so many questions like that.
[0:30] Unbelievable. 4 hours meeting. So we
[0:34] cover we we we even went back a little
[0:37] bit on courtship and move back and cover
[0:40] everything on engagement. I sent to
[0:43] sister Adasa the database all the
[0:46] document of the court
[0:48] &gt;&gt; they printed out for free. So everybody
[0:51] you go ahead and get those copy and you
[0:54] know exactly what the prophet say about
[0:56] everything that we spoke about. Amen.
[0:59] For those who missed yesterday, the copy
[1:02] will be at the deacons. So you go visit
[1:05] Sister Joanne. She'll be more than happy
[1:07] to sit with you and you can watch that
[1:10] with Sister Joanne and make sure you
[1:12] catch up yourself. But if you miss, I'm
[1:15] going to still hold you responsible
[1:18] &gt;&gt; for the material that was delivered.
[1:21] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. So these are very difficult and
[1:25] tough and very tough subject when it
[1:28] comes to vow and everything. Like I say,
[1:30] I am preaching to the young people. I
[1:32] don't want to come and deal with a
[1:34] divorce. I'm going one time you go there
[1:37] and then we finish we seal it. The next
[1:40] day we see you in the rapture. You and
[1:42] your husband and your children over
[1:43] there. I'm dealing with the old
[1:45] generation that had that didn't have the
[1:48] teaching that you have. And I'm even
[1:51] giving you things that me myself as a
[1:53] pastor didn't even know.
[1:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. I didn't know that brother
[1:56] Brandham did a proposal under the tree.
[1:59] &gt;&gt; All of those are in the quote over
[2:01] there.
[2:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. And me that have to correct
[2:03] brother Brandham about the proposal and
[2:06] tell him you don't put a ring on me
[2:07] until you talk to my parent. I got the
[2:09] quote over there.
[2:12] &gt;&gt; I got the quote over there.
[2:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. I gave you all the quotes. The
[2:17] quotes are over there. Amen. [applause]
[2:20] Like I said, if a young man was not
[2:22] taught like you, you have a
[2:24] responsibility to recalibrate the young
[2:26] man and bring him back again online.
[2:29] Amen. Every single quote is over there
[2:32] for free.
[2:33] &gt;&gt; So that has been said.
[2:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:37] &gt;&gt; There is no fusses. There is no problem
[2:40] now.
[2:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[2:42] &gt;&gt; I'm saying this before something comes
[2:44] up
[2:44] &gt;&gt; because some people wait till there is a
[2:46] problem and they run on the problem and
[2:49] say I'm going to leave the church but
[2:51] they already purposed to leave the
[2:52] church. They were waiting for a problem.
[2:53] So there is no problem now.
[2:55] &gt;&gt; Okay there is no problem now. So parent
[3:00] everything that I have been teaching
[3:02] these children they gathered I print out
[3:06] everything and this is the standard
[3:08] [snorts] that we have for this church.
[3:11] Amen.
[3:11] &gt;&gt; I am not going to lower any standard.
[3:14] &gt;&gt; I am not going to change any standard. I
[3:18] am not going to I mean compromise any
[3:20] standard because everything that was
[3:23] brought up came from the Bible and the
[3:25] message of the hour. You voted me to
[3:28] preach the Bible according to the
[3:30] message of the hour. Are we clear? So if
[3:34] a child, a young man or a young sister
[3:37] in this church go against what has been
[3:41] taught.
[3:43] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[3:44] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[3:44] &gt;&gt; Are we together? If the parent
[3:47] compromise with it,
[3:49] &gt;&gt; count me out.
[3:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:53] &gt;&gt; Brother, can you say amen?
[3:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:55] &gt;&gt; Count me completely out.
[3:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. In other word, if you go against
[4:00] everything that we discussed yesterday
[4:03] &gt;&gt; and that I taught you in courtship and
[4:05] whatever,
[4:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. Don't put pressure on me.
[4:09] &gt;&gt; I am not going to bless your marriage.
[4:12] &gt;&gt; You didn't get me well.
[4:17] &gt;&gt; If I have to preach this and go home,
[4:19] that's fine.
[4:20] &gt;&gt; Let's make sure because there is no
[4:22] problem.
[4:22] &gt;&gt; No, sir. If an unbeliever is coming from
[4:25] denomination
[4:26] &gt;&gt; and they don't know anything about the
[4:28] message
[4:29] &gt;&gt; and they come to me they have been
[4:30] probably leaving as a boyfriend have
[4:32] children and they say brother Stephen we
[4:34] want you to bless the marriage it's a
[4:36] different story
[4:38] &gt;&gt; I will sit with them I will go through
[4:39] the teaching and everything and make
[4:41] sure everything is clear before I lay my
[4:43] hand
[4:44] &gt;&gt; that's why when they call me in uh Ohio
[4:47] I have to make sure everything is
[4:49] correct if not I don't lay my hand on
[4:52] Are we together? You are not off the
[4:55] street.
[4:56] &gt;&gt; God gave you a best privilege ever
[4:59] &gt;&gt; that we didn't have. [applause]
[5:03] &gt;&gt; Are we together? If you didn't show up,
[5:06] that's your problem. That's not my
[5:07] problem. God gave you the best privilege
[5:10] ever.
[5:10] &gt;&gt; That's true.
[5:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. We taught you everything before
[5:13] you get in trouble.
[5:14] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[5:15] &gt;&gt; So, if you turn around and you go
[5:18] against the word of God,
[5:19] &gt;&gt; that's it. Let's be clear, parent. I am
[5:22] not going to bless your marriage. You
[5:24] need to find another pastor.
[5:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[5:26] &gt;&gt; Don't even invite me
[5:30] &gt;&gt; because I won't be there to support what
[5:33] I know is against the word of God.
[5:35] &gt;&gt; Don't put the pressure on brother John
[5:38] &gt;&gt; to announce your marriage right here.
[5:40] &gt;&gt; Don't put the pressure on the song
[5:42] leader to announce your marriage here.
[5:44] DON'T PUT THE PRESSURE on the YOUNG
[5:46] PEOPLE
[5:48] &gt;&gt; to pull them to the marriage that is
[5:50] contrary to THE WORD OF GOD. DON'T PUT A
[5:53] PRESSURE ON THE CHURCH
[5:56] &gt;&gt; TO BRING PEOPLE TO SUPPORT YOU BECAUSE
[5:58] you're doing something contrary to the
[5:59] word.
[6:00] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[6:02] &gt;&gt; Count me out.
[6:06] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[6:08] &gt;&gt; I preach church order here. I preach
[6:11] every single office in the church order
[6:13] here. every single of them. The copies
[6:15] are there. If you want to know, it's
[6:17] right there. I even invited the whole
[6:19] church to be there. So if you don't
[6:22] comply with what has been preached, sit
[6:24] down on the pew.
[6:25] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[6:26] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[6:27] &gt;&gt; I preach about music part one, part two,
[6:29] part three. Everything about music is
[6:32] right here. If you don't comply as a
[6:34] musician, sit down.
[6:36] &gt;&gt; But don't bring any influence right
[6:38] here. And don't pull somebody. Don't
[6:39] put, in other words, do not put any
[6:41] pressure right here.
[6:43] Amen. We already establish everything.
[6:45] Parent, they going to have the code. You
[6:48] can take the quote from them. You can
[6:50] read all the code. We can be on the same
[6:52] page. If you want to see the tape, the
[6:54] deacon have it. You go to the deacon.
[6:56] You can review everything clear. Are we
[6:59] together?
[7:00] &gt;&gt; So don't put pressure on me.
[7:03] &gt;&gt; I'm not going to bless your wedding.
[7:04] &gt;&gt; I'm not going to even be there because
[7:07] you're going against the word of God.
[7:09] There was a young man that came to me. I
[7:11] told him I said what you're trying to do
[7:13] is against what brother Brandham say. He
[7:15] left the church and went married. Thank
[7:16] God he didn't even call me because I
[7:18] would not even go. Are we together? So
[7:21] if it get to the point we got to
[7:22] separate,
[7:24] let's separate in peace.
[7:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[7:27] &gt;&gt; There is no problem. Are we together?
[7:29] But as for me and this church, I'm going
[7:32] to stay behind the word,
[7:34] &gt;&gt; behind the message of the hour and
[7:36] behind the word.
[7:37] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[7:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[7:39] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[7:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. Your parents do not make those
[7:42] daughter to compromise
[7:44] &gt;&gt; because there was a question yesterday.
[7:46] We are trying to stand on the ground on
[7:49] the message and the parent are
[7:50] compromising.
[7:54] &gt;&gt; So brother Brandham say no daddy's
[7:55] saying that's okay you can go ahead and
[7:57] do it. Mom is saying that's okay you can
[7:59] go ahead and do it. That's not correct.
[8:01] I taught them I gave them quote even
[8:04] about the gift yesterday.
[8:06] &gt;&gt; When should a man give you a gift? All
[8:08] of them are in the quote over there. All
[8:10] of them are in the court according to
[8:12] brother Brana.
[8:13] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[8:14] &gt;&gt; So parent, let's stick together. I
[8:16] already called you and I told you do not
[8:19] be aggressive to old men.
[8:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right. Amen.
[8:22] &gt;&gt; Young sisters, do not be aggressive to
[8:25] old men.
[8:26] &gt;&gt; Courtship is not marriage.
[8:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. In courtship, you don't go to the
[8:30] man's house and BEGIN TO WASH DISHES
[8:33] &gt;&gt; and begin to wash the bathroom and begin
[8:36] to be a a door DASH FOR THE young man to
[8:39] bring him and deliver food over there.
[8:41] Parent, WHEN YOU SEE THINGS LIKE THIS,
[8:43] CHASE THEM AWAY FROM HOME. Tell them
[8:45] [laughter] don't come home.
[8:48] &gt;&gt; I don't know if you got it.
[8:50] &gt;&gt; I don't know if YOU GET IT.
[8:51] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[8:52] &gt;&gt; WE CLEAR TOGETHER. You are not married.
[8:54] You are not a married woman. They are
[8:57] calling you. Amen. If your husband is in
[9:00] Mississippi, you don't leave here to go
[9:03] to Mississippi. I already told you
[9:04] yesterday. The husband leave Mississippi
[9:08] and come right here.
[9:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[9:09] &gt;&gt; To see you. Amen.
[9:11] &gt;&gt; You don't leave here and book a hotel to
[9:14] go see your boyfriend. DON'T BUY HIM
[9:16] GIFT.
[9:18] &gt;&gt; HE IS THE ONE to win your soul.
[9:21] &gt;&gt; I'm talking. Some of you are laughing.
[9:23] THIS IS NOT A GAME.
[9:26] THIS IS NOT A GAME.
[9:28] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER?
[9:30] &gt;&gt; RESPECT YOURSELF and the young men will
[9:33] respect you.
[9:34] &gt;&gt; GIVE YOURSELF HONOR.
[9:36] &gt;&gt; You are not sheep.
[9:39] &gt;&gt; You are daughters of the king.
[9:41] &gt;&gt; You are God's.
[9:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[9:44] [applause]
[9:44] &gt;&gt; You are not.
[9:50] I don't know where this came up of of
[9:53] young sister begging men
[9:57] &gt;&gt; like it's the last marriage in the
[9:59] entire world
[10:00] &gt;&gt; who put you under pressure
[10:02] &gt;&gt; and parent don't put them under
[10:04] pressure.
[10:04] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham say you should not
[10:06] marry a boy because your mother love
[10:08] him.
[10:09] &gt;&gt; That's what brother Brandham say.
[10:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[10:12] &gt;&gt; If you get beaten your mother won't get
[10:13] beaten. You'll be the one beaten.
[10:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. So make sure you find the head.
[10:19] &gt;&gt; A true Christian.
[10:21] [cheering]
[10:22] [applause]
[10:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[10:25] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[10:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[10:27] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[10:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[10:28] &gt;&gt; Parents, ARE WE TOGETHER?
[10:31] &gt;&gt; IN COURTSHIP, DON'T BEG THE YOUNG MEN.
[10:34] &gt;&gt; DON'T GO TO THE HOUSES AND WASH DISHES
[10:37] AND VACUUMING THE HOUSE. DON'T DO THAT.
[10:44] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Amen.
[10:46] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[10:48] &gt;&gt; So I put heaven and earth to be witness
[10:50] between me and you
[10:52] &gt;&gt; that everything is clear. The video and
[10:55] the deacon the courts are over there.
[10:58] Youngsmen once we finish the the
[11:00] finances then we start courtship with
[11:02] them. All of them need to be on the same
[11:04] page.
[11:05] &gt;&gt; Is it a false vow? Is it a true vow?
[11:07] Whatever. Every answer was answered
[11:10] yesterday with quote after quote after
[11:12] quote after quote. So don't come and
[11:15] search for trouble again and say this is
[11:17] this. I'm not going to be part of it.
[11:19] I'm going to be at home sitting with my
[11:21] family and you have your marriage over
[11:23] there where you going to go to hell.
[11:24] That's your problem. There was a man,
[11:27] it's not in this church, a young man who
[11:30] left the message. And he was putting
[11:32] pressure on his siblings to leave the
[11:35] message. And I was talking to the
[11:37] father. The father told me that I told
[11:38] him you go to hell yourself.
[11:40] &gt;&gt; So don't pull people with you.
[11:43] Are we together? Young people, watch
[11:45] what you supporting.
[11:47] &gt;&gt; Watch what you supporting
[11:49] &gt;&gt; because what you supporting, you'll be
[11:50] held accountable according to the
[11:52] scripture.
[11:53] &gt;&gt; Oh, I just want to show a support. No,
[11:55] no, no. If it's contrary to the word, do
[11:57] not go.
[11:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. [cheering]
[11:59] [applause]
[12:01] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[12:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[12:03] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[12:04] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[12:06] &gt;&gt; Praise God. We are not popping balloons
[12:09] right here in the message. your pastor
[12:11] is V. I see all this stuff. I'm on I'm
[12:15] I'm I'm not an old pastor.
[12:18] &gt;&gt; And I told somebody, you want to be a
[12:20] pastor in this message today? You got to
[12:22] pro you you you need to know you got to
[12:24] get in technology and see what these
[12:26] people are doing. Your pastor knows all
[12:29] about the popping balloons and
[12:30] everything. I already screen all of
[12:32] that. So no foolishness in this church.
[12:36] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[12:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[12:38] &gt;&gt; No foolishness in this church.
[12:40] &gt;&gt; [cheering and applause]
[12:41] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[12:43] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[12:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[12:46] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[12:49] &gt;&gt; Let's give the Lord a big clap of
[12:51] [applause]
[12:58] praise God. [applause]
[13:00] &gt;&gt; Sister Adasa, you can keep this. If
[13:02] somebody come with fastes, I will call
[13:04] the whole church. I say, "You remember
[13:05] me telling you that day?
[13:07] &gt;&gt; Don't put pressure on me."
[13:09] Amen. Let's all stand behind the word of
[13:12] God and let's stand for the reading of
[13:14] the scripture.
[13:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[13:16] &gt;&gt; Let's be true message believers.
[13:19] &gt;&gt; Brother Steven preach us the message.
[13:21] They begin to preach the message. You
[13:22] begin to pick and choose. No, no, no,
[13:24] no, no. We don't pick and choose. We
[13:26] stay right there.
[13:27] &gt;&gt; Mama don't want to stay with the
[13:29] message. Stay with the message. Daddy
[13:31] don't want to stay with the message.
[13:32] Stay with the message. Pastor don't want
[13:34] to stay with the message. You stay with
[13:36] the message regardless of anyone. If
[13:39] it's in the word, it's about your life.
[13:42] &gt;&gt; At the end of the day, you will be the
[13:43] one married and you're going to live
[13:45] with that rascal
[13:46] &gt;&gt; and usually they are crows. They don't
[13:48] die quickly.
[13:52] &gt;&gt; They don't die quickly. They will make
[13:53] you suffer. They don't die quickly. You
[13:56] will be praying God kill him. God kill
[13:58] him. He won't die quickly. and you will
[14:00] be the best preacher in the message
[14:03] about the coming of the Lord. May the
[14:04] Lord come quickly because your marriage
[14:06] is badly.
[14:11] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[14:13] &gt;&gt; Are we together? I'm sparing you a lot
[14:16] of headache. You need to ask yourself a
[14:18] question. Why are the older one keep
[14:20] saying, "I wish I knew this.
[14:22] &gt;&gt; I wish I knew this."
[14:24] &gt;&gt; And you are right there and you don't
[14:26] even care. Amen.
[14:28] &gt;&gt; You want to go the hard way.
[14:32] &gt;&gt; Oh, brother Steven, I was not there. You
[14:34] are responsible to go to the deacon and
[14:37] listen to it. But I'm not going to lower
[14:39] my standard. I am not going to lower my
[14:42] standard. I was talking to somebody. I
[14:44] said, "This is what I taught in church."
[14:46] He's not a member of this church. I
[14:47] said, "This is what I taught in church.
[14:49] I'm not changing the standard because
[14:50] what I brought came from the message of
[14:52] the hour and from the Bible. I'm not
[14:54] going to back up. Are we together?
[14:57] Because the only protection we have is
[14:59] the message.
[15:00] &gt;&gt; When you start playing with the message,
[15:01] you are destroying the protection. Then
[15:03] we're in trouble.
[15:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[15:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[15:07] &gt;&gt; Uh you are our honeys. I gave you the
[15:10] quote.
[15:11] &gt;&gt; So I'm jealous
[15:13] &gt;&gt; of you.
[15:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[15:15] &gt;&gt; My babies in the gospel. I'm very
[15:17] jealous of you.
[15:20] &gt;&gt; I gave you three quotes.
[15:22] &gt;&gt; So don't search any problem. Let's go to
[15:24] the book of Luke.
[15:26] [laughter]
[15:28] &gt;&gt; Ah, it's a beautiful thing to get your
[15:31] blood, the blood of people off your
[15:33] hand.
[15:33] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Yes, sir.
[15:34] &gt;&gt; So, I can go to sleep.
[15:37] &gt;&gt; That's true.
[15:37] &gt;&gt; And enjoy life, too.
[15:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[15:42] &gt;&gt; My subject this morning, flight
[15:44] attendant, prepare for takeoff, is our
[15:47] life journey through Joseph's five
[15:50] garment, part 50.
[15:58] &gt;&gt; [music]
