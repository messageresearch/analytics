Let it come forth exactly like you gave it to him, Lord God. And just feed us this morning, Lord. What a wonderful thing, Lord, to be here, Lord Jesus. We thank you, Father. We love you. We don't have words, Lord, to express ourselves, but we just ask, Lord God, that you finish the work in us that you started, Lord God. It's too late for us to turn back, Lord God. We just want to ask that you just carry us on through, Lord. We all familiar with the footprints in the sand, Lord. There's times where there's only one set because you're carrying us, Lord.

And amen and amen. Hallelujah. Y'all might be seated just a minute. I do have um I do have now actually three testimonies. We'll three short ones. Everybody's said a little a little one, a quick one, and a short one. So, let's have the testimonies first because I'm sure they're praise reports and uh and then we'll read these prayer requests and pray over them. Amen. And we do have some specials this morning as well. Amen. Brother Greg, Brother Greg is the one that has a little one. He's got a little testimony. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I won't. &gt;&gt; I know. About to get one. Uh, Lord bless you all. Um, after that service Wednesday, if you got any problems after that, I don't know. Um, but, uh, Friday evening, uh, I do have glasses, but I I don't hardly ever wear them. Um, but Friday evening after I was finishing up a job, I was on my way home and um it was dark and I I put my glasses on and everything is blurry. I'm thinking, what's going on with that? You know, so I took them off and I could see. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I put them back on and everything was blurry. So, I'd just claim that my eyes are getting better. &gt;&gt; Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful. Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Tony has the quick testimony. Amen. God bless you, my brother. I try not to let it get longer while I'm up here. &gt;&gt; Um, just a quick testimony. I don't know if y'all remember a couple weeks ago, brother Self read a prayer request on convention night about our son. He had like a growth on the steroids and they was trying to say they want to check and see if it was cancerous. Um and they scheduled the test for like maybe two weeks out and um you know that's just enough time for the devil to work. I said I said why they schedule it so far out? I said because he want to aggravate you for two weeks. I I I said, "But we prayed. Y'all prayed and they end up canceling the um appointment to check in and it said everything was normal." So everything got thrown out. So thank you. &gt;&gt; Wonderful. Woo. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Last but not least, the short testimony, right? Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God bless you all. I believe you're doing good. &gt;&gt; Well, the first one it might be a bit I guess small but to me I thought it was big. So at work during break like they have a ping pong table and I learn how to play ping pong over there, right? And there's a person there that creates his own pad and when he makes his pad it's like around $250 to $300 and he get he made one for me and gave it for me. He gave it to me for free. So to me that was something big. I thought that was pretty cool. And the second was because there's certain position at work and where it kind of put you like in authority doing certain things you have a lot of responsibility and they kind of pulled me there and I didn't know what I was doing but somehow everything was working and at one point I had told uh one of the person that pulled me in that position I needed to do something. I told him I don't think I'm able to do it. I don't think there's any way for me to make it or whatever. And as I was saying that, we were walking after that, I saw like I guess the answer to what I was looking for right there. And he told me, "Never say never." Then I was like, "Yeah, that must be God." So I want to thank the Lord God for it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I have another praise report handed to me from Sister Hadasa. She wants to thank the Lord for the young brothers and sisters here at Spoken Word. She said, "I appreciate all they do to help and they were truly a blessing yesterday during the meeting. May the Lord rich you uh richly bless you all." Amen. Praise God. And we feel the same way. I I think our children here, forgive me for using the word children, but uh I think we have a very special special caliber of young people here. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; And and we know who we know who's responsible. We put it all on God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Okay. I do have some pray some prayer requests. And first of all, I would like to um uh to mention brother Biscll's name. You know, he went on to the Lord. I think it was Thursday after many, many, many years. A lot of us got to see him in Swansea when he came down to this area. I think um when we saw him, I lifted Rebecca up with one hand there. They mentioned something about children being raised in the message and she was small enough then where not, you know, she was a baby, of course, but she's just like I lifted her up. I remember that. I'll never forget it. Amen. And um so we want to remember his family in church in prayer. I'm sure they're rejoicing. Amen. Because that was a very long life spent. You know, if you need to know who he is, go look up the 42 inch caribou horns. Yes, brother Tony. Come on up with Sister Rosemary. Amen. Amen. God bless you saints. &gt;&gt; Um a quick testimony. This is way way overdue. Uh there was a time my husband and I we asked for God. We were both praying in different ways. I asked for God for something very very specific, a specific amount. and my husband asked for a specific date. Um this was um for the sale of our home cuz it had taken 3 months desperation set in the God gave us our answers both of us. And I also so I really wanted to thank God for that. Um I'm also taking this opportunity to let you all know we are going for the barrier of our 15year-old grandbaby that passed. So we'll be traveling next week. We'll be away for a couple weeks. We desire your prayers. God bless. &gt;&gt; God bless. Lord be with you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. We also have a a prayer request as well for a Miss Alicia. Um she will be undergoing treatment um for stage four breast cancer. I don't know who this is from, but we just we just want to hold on to Miss Alicia this week as um this is pretty, you know, this is a pretty serious request, but God is able. He's he's able. Amen.

You wait for the next one, and we keep moving. So we can pray together as a church. We get on, you put your prayer request, you bring your request, and we start praying one hour, everybody, so we can uh at least ambush the devil &gt;&gt; because somebody might be out of town. They're living further away from the church. They need three hours. So, let's remove all of that. God gave us some technology &gt;&gt; where you can be three or three hours away, but we can all get in contact and we can uh pray together. Amen. &gt;&gt; Everybody okay with that? &gt;&gt; Praise God. Brother Glenn, Brother Tony, I believe I got everything covered. If I forget something, Brother Robert, you let me know. But I believe we got everything. So, let's go to our reading this morning and then get into the word. I was trying to move on. I can't move on. I need to get something in front before we get to further instruction of the season. So the Holy Spirit, I'm a pastor who have to obey. I have to obey the Holy Spirit and then do what he want me to do because it's not my church. It is his church. &gt;&gt; I'm just here as a manager, but I got a big boss. &gt;&gt; Amen. He's the one talking. Amen. So flight attendant prepare for takeoff. Let's pray. Heavenly Father, &gt;&gt; Lord, we are approaching you humbly this morning. Father, we thank you for your grace, for your love, your mercy, and for everything that you have been doing for us. Father, this is as far as I can go with the ability that you have given me. This is not a human ability. It's a Holy Ghost ability because there is nothing we can brag about it. Everything is about you and it's all about you Jesus. Father, Lord Jesus, may you come and speak to us all and bless us both visible and invisible audience. Lord, may you move everything away Lord. May you come in the power of resurrection and may you bless your children as we commit it all unto thy hand in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Let's go to the book of 1 Chronicle again, chapter 12. You need your Bible as we traveling this. My subject this morning, my title this morning is our life journey through Joseph five garment part 79. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; My theme this morning, Lord willing. Oh, the picture of the cloud. It's a nice picture. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; My theme this morning is the right focus. &gt;&gt; The right focus. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. in seasons because many things happen in season but you need to know where to focus. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because the devil won't let you just grab what is yours like that. &gt;&gt; Forget it my friend. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So we need to get some instruction on how to focus. If you there you can say amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. 1st Chronicle 12:32. &gt;&gt; What a praise. I was also dancing in my office. I could not I could not help it. I was It's my CE. I could not help it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank God for the speaker over there. &gt;&gt; If you got a problem, I got a quote. &gt;&gt; You got a problem? H because brother Brandham saw a sister, &gt;&gt; not a brother, &gt;&gt; not a brother, &gt;&gt; a sister &gt;&gt; dancing. &gt;&gt; And brother Brham was about to was starting to criticize &gt;&gt; until the anointing hit. Brother Brham &gt;&gt; and my prophet found himself &gt;&gt; dancing with a sister. &gt;&gt; Oh, do you need the code? &gt;&gt; Do you need the code? Hey, [Applause] &gt;&gt; if it happened here, you would say, "Brother, no." The prophet of the hour, &gt;&gt; the sister was dancing and brother Moso was dancing. [Applause] [Laughter] &gt;&gt; Your your your PhD in fology. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. The prophet dance under the anointing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If the prophet dance, who am I? &gt;&gt; One day they were worshiping the Lord &gt;&gt; and the anointing hit the system &gt;&gt; and the sister move on from the worship &gt;&gt; from the piano &gt;&gt; and God &gt;&gt; the angel of the Lord &gt;&gt; came down and begin to play the piano. Yes sir. &gt;&gt; If God is worshiping &gt;&gt; with the piano, &gt;&gt; what should I do? &gt;&gt; What should I do? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Remove your former stuff away. &gt;&gt; Worship the Lord freely. &gt;&gt; Praise him freely. [Music] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Jesus, &gt;&gt; that's your problem. You'll be disappointed. Wait the day of the rapture. &gt;&gt; When everything is left, &gt;&gt; oh my Godship. &gt;&gt; You will understand why Miriam took the temple. &gt;&gt; Because something happened, &gt;&gt; my friend. I'm loaded. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; I'm loaded in scripture and in quote, I'm loaded. I have them like this &gt;&gt; and I keep some of them on my phone. &gt;&gt; In case somebody attack, I just pull my phone and begin to load. &gt;&gt; We are normal people. People that laugh, &gt;&gt; people that smile, &gt;&gt; people that get upset, &gt;&gt; even Jesus got upset. Yes, &gt;&gt; he did. &gt;&gt; Release me. First Chronicle chapter 12, please. 1 Chronicle chapter 12. It was like yesterday on a married couple. I'm trying to move and this one is pulling and this one is pulling. This one is pulling. And now we ended up stopping at the surface. &gt;&gt; 1 Chronicle 12:32. If you dare, you can say amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The Bible says, "And the children of Issachar," now it's clear to you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Which were men that had understanding of times. You might be seated. It's people that have understanding. &gt;&gt; Understanding of what? &gt;&gt; Understanding. &gt;&gt; Of times. Understanding. Understanding of time. &gt;&gt; Times plural. In other words, they understood season. &gt;&gt; Amen. They had understanding of times come to know what Israel ought to do. &gt;&gt; So that understanding gave them the ability to see the right path &gt;&gt; that they need to take &gt;&gt; the right action to take &gt;&gt; when a season arrive &gt;&gt; plus the doing &gt;&gt; the right act to do. Amen. Because when you have a correct instructions, now you know what it is. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They know uh how what Israel ought to do. The heads of them were 200 and all their brethren were at their commandment. Amen. With this scripture, we found out that season has messages. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; A season got a message. A season got a package. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And you need to decode the message. &gt;&gt; And if you don't decode, it will pass through you &gt;&gt; and you don't even understand what it is. May the Lord add the blessing to the reading of the word &gt;&gt; in case you were waiting. That's it. The Lord add the blessing to the reading of his word. Amen. So we found out that if you need to understand time, there is a message in time. &gt;&gt; There is a messaging season &gt;&gt; and that message need to be understood. &gt;&gt; That message need to be discerned. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because in that message there is instruction for that specific season. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he will tell you what to do. Amen. Because according to Ecclesiastes 3:1, we know that the Bible says that to everything, &gt;&gt; not something to everything. There is what? &gt;&gt; Season &gt;&gt; because everything comes with a season. &gt;&gt; So if a season come, something come. &gt;&gt; We need to know what came. &gt;&gt; What is in the package? &gt;&gt; What is going on? &gt;&gt; Is this my season? Yes. But what is what am I supposed to get in this season? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So because season got messages, it is important to know how to decode a season. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because the problem is how do I know that it's my season? &gt;&gt; I already have an understanding. You can refocus, sister. as I already have an understanding that season got something for me &gt;&gt; that everything in my life have a season &gt;&gt; and I don't want to miss a season. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because if I miss a season, I miss something. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And I need to stay alert &gt;&gt; to know what is coming up in my life. &gt;&gt; And the children of Issach have to be beside David &gt;&gt; to be able to discern the time. &gt;&gt; Amen. to discern the sign, to discern the season, and to tell David what to do. Are we together? &gt;&gt; So, David was not strong only in &gt;&gt; masses, &gt;&gt; he was also strong in wisdom. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Strong in discernment, &gt;&gt; by the people that God put around him &gt;&gt; to help strengthen his kingdom &gt;&gt; and see and foresee the future. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Brham says this very familiar quote now to this church. He said Jesus here was speaking. He said father the what? &gt;&gt; The time has come. &gt;&gt; So time happened. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; All time come. So there will be a time that is not time. &gt;&gt; But there will be a time that is time. &gt;&gt; There will be an hour that things must happen. Yes. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham say now there is season for what? &gt;&gt; Everything. &gt;&gt; Everything have a season. Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; You saw in a water &gt;&gt; certain season &gt;&gt; and you reap where? &gt;&gt; In a certain season. &gt;&gt; That's why it's important to know the season. &gt;&gt; Because if you don't know that this is a sewing time, &gt;&gt; you will miss the opportunity to sow. And when it's the time to reap, there is nothing to reap &gt;&gt; because you miss the opportunity to sow. &gt;&gt; Many time we regret in our lives. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; When we tell somebody that if you put $200 aside, &gt;&gt; every month, &gt;&gt; the person will sit down and say $200 a month, &gt;&gt; what is it for? &gt;&gt; It's not a lot of money. &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. &gt;&gt; Amen. But if you take two, I'm going with a simple example. If you take 200 * 12, &gt;&gt; how much money is it now? &gt;&gt; It's 2400, it's $2,400 a month. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How long have we been in this church? 2,400 * 5 is what? &gt;&gt; And then Oh, now we begin to talk. &gt;&gt; Uh, please come and preach with me. &gt;&gt; Get your calculator right there. I'm trying to save myself. &gt;&gt; Is what? &gt;&gt; No, there is a five with a with a four. They got to be a zero. If not, I'm gonna do the math myself. &gt;&gt; If not, I do it myself. &gt;&gt; What? &gt;&gt; We say 2,400 * 5. &gt;&gt; How much is it? &gt;&gt; 12,000. &gt;&gt; 12,000. &gt;&gt; Everybody agree? &gt;&gt; So in this five years, how much money should be in your bank account? How much money did we lost in five years? &gt;&gt; I just used $200 &gt;&gt; a month &gt;&gt; today in your bank account. &gt;&gt; Everybody should have how much? Take $12,000 multiply by your number &gt;&gt; in this church. Oh, &gt;&gt; I I'm sorry. You know what? Let me preach the seventh seal. &gt;&gt; No, I'm preaching the sevens here. [Applause] [Music] &gt;&gt; Okay. Okay. Okay. I'm going to pick a number. &gt;&gt; Okay. Let me pick a number. We are 100 people. &gt;&gt; We are 100 people. &gt;&gt; Oh, you want 120 like in the upper room? &gt;&gt; My friend, I'm preaching. &gt;&gt; Let's take we 100 people in this church. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; 100 people in this church that were disciplined for five years. &gt;&gt; Discipline with $200. How much money should we have in this church? [Music] One more. [Music] &gt;&gt; There you go. [Music] &gt;&gt; Like that. &gt;&gt; Like this. &gt;&gt; Like this. [Applause] Shake your neighbor. &gt;&gt; Shake your neighbor's hand. &gt;&gt; Let's stay down. &gt;&gt; Let Let's slow down. &gt;&gt; Let's slow down. &gt;&gt; Let's slow down. &gt;&gt; Is a million dollar hard to get? &gt;&gt; Because on the day of Pentecost, &gt;&gt; they put their things together. Ah, &gt;&gt; it's written in your Bible. &gt;&gt; In the day of Pentecost, when the Holy Ghost came, &gt;&gt; they took everything and they put it together. So, if the anointing of Pentecost &gt;&gt; anoint us right now and everybody have $12,000 and we put $12,000 together, how much will we have? &gt;&gt; How much should we have? [Music] Do we need to borrow money from the bank? [Applause] &gt;&gt; Do you see what I'm saying? &gt;&gt; Do you see what I'm saying? &gt;&gt; Do you see what I'm saying? &gt;&gt; So if I double this toward $400 a month. &gt;&gt; We are talking. Come on. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. Do you want me to blow your mind? &gt;&gt; Do you want me to blow your mind again? &gt;&gt; Every month. Every month. &gt;&gt; $1,000. &gt;&gt; Every month. $1,000. &gt;&gt; Times 12. &gt;&gt; You can criticize. I'm talking to my church. &gt;&gt; How much is it? How much? &gt;&gt; 12,000. &gt;&gt; A what? &gt;&gt; A year. &gt;&gt; A year. 12,000 a year times 100 people, &gt;&gt; in a year. No, 12,000 times 100. &gt;&gt; Okay. So, we add 0 0 again. &gt;&gt; Okay. This is for year. Okay. Times five years. &gt;&gt; What is it? Please come. How How much is it? &gt;&gt; Six water. &gt;&gt; Is this a big deal? &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; I hope you are awaken now. &gt;&gt; I hope you awaken now. &gt;&gt; Because we say, "Lord, give me a big job. When you give me a big job, then I will have more money. It's it's it's passing you &gt;&gt; every month. It's passing you. &gt;&gt; Amazon got it. &gt;&gt; Timu got it. Timu got it. &gt;&gt; That's why Tim, please help me up. That's why Amazon is a billionaire because every church in America, Amazon is getting money. Timu is getting money. &gt;&gt; Tesla is getting money. Those people are gleaming everything we just spoke. &gt;&gt; That's why the millionaire [Applause] &gt;&gt; Let's talk about spiritual things. &gt;&gt; But you were there yesterday. &gt;&gt; You know what? I gave you the quote. from the Bible and the quote yesterday. You were there. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To everything there is a seasonal &gt;&gt; and it's important to discern the season &gt;&gt; because you will miss your opportunity. [Applause] &gt;&gt; You going to the bank to borrow what? $10,000. You could have put your own $10,000 yourself, your own $12,000. You want to I mean fix your roof $6,000 and crying uh Lord pray prayer request. Let's pray request. Prayer request. Your prayer request was already there. Answer it. [Laughter] I'm saying you saw in a water &gt;&gt; certain season &gt;&gt; and you reap in water &gt;&gt; certain season &gt;&gt; and there is season when the time comes &gt;&gt; that is right for don't regret &gt;&gt; don't don't sit here begin to regret thank God he open your eyes today be &gt;&gt; because the decision you going to make today will determine five years &gt;&gt; thank God from today begin to change. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Are we together? And brother Brandham said there is season when the times come that is right for these things were not in my note. &gt;&gt; So they are coming from somewhere. &gt;&gt; Uh he says and there is season when the times comes that is what &gt;&gt; right for things &gt;&gt; for things to do what &gt;&gt; to happen. &gt;&gt; In other words the season bring the correct time. for something to happen. &gt;&gt; So season doesn't just bring something. &gt;&gt; It brings something and it brings the proper time. &gt;&gt; In other words, the season will bring things that will lock the devil. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; A certain way. I know why I'm saying a certain way. So that things may happen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? Because the Bible say in Ecclesiastes 3:1 that he God has made what &gt;&gt; how &gt;&gt; beautiful &gt;&gt; when. &gt;&gt; So if something it's if it's the season whatever is going there will come out beautiful. &gt;&gt; You want a beautiful house wait for the season. &gt;&gt; You want a beautiful husband? Wait for the season. You want a beautiful wife, wait for the season. Whatever you want to come out beautiful. Make sure it's in the season. &gt;&gt; If it's in the season, God will back you up. &gt;&gt; Because God is behind the season. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; But brother Stephen, the children of Issachar, they were discerning season. How do we do that? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, thank God. Glory to God. &gt;&gt; The Bible says in Matthew 24:32, Jesus say, "Now learn &gt;&gt; a parable of what?" &gt;&gt; The fig tree. &gt;&gt; Jesus didn't say go get a seminar. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Jesus didn't say go buy books on Amazon. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How to decode the season. &gt;&gt; Jesus say my instruction. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; For season &gt;&gt; I already gave it to everybody. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Jesus say learn a parable of what? &gt;&gt; Tree. &gt;&gt; So the fig tree that you pass all the time &gt;&gt; has a message. Amen. &gt;&gt; He didn't say learn the parable of God. &gt;&gt; Learn the parable of the tree. &gt;&gt; So the tree got a parable. &gt;&gt; The tree got a message. &gt;&gt; And Jesus say look at that tree. The tree has been talking to you all along. &gt;&gt; In other words, God is in nature. &gt;&gt; And brother said the first Bible he used sir &gt;&gt; was nature. That's why Paul in Romans 1:20 say for the invisible things of him &gt;&gt; of God from the creation of the world are clearly what &gt;&gt; being understood you see it first then you understood by the things that are water &gt;&gt; in other words if you look at what God have created &gt;&gt; and how God is running nature God is talking to you plainly. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If there is a winter, there must be a spring. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If there is a winter, there must be a spring. &gt;&gt; Until you can even predict the clothing. &gt;&gt; You can predict what is coming up. &gt;&gt; So if a winter is happening in your life, &gt;&gt; what should follow the winter? &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. He says, "For the things are clearly seen and being what?" &gt;&gt; understood &gt;&gt; by the things that are what made &gt;&gt; even his what? &gt;&gt; eternal power &gt;&gt; and his what &gt;&gt; and Godhead &gt;&gt; so that they are how? &gt;&gt; Without excuse. &gt;&gt; In other words, if you look at nature, you will understand Godhead. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This is what Paul is saying. &gt;&gt; Paul is saying if you look at nature, you will see the eternal power of God. You will see a tree going and dying and coming back in resurrection and coming back in resurrection. So every spring it's talking about a resurrection &gt;&gt; because God is speaking through nature. &gt;&gt; So your answer are already nature. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't worry my friend. Jesus said learn a parable of what? &gt;&gt; The fig tree. &gt;&gt; When his branch is yet what? tender &gt;&gt; and putting forth water. &gt;&gt; Which month are which season are we in? &gt;&gt; Spring. Ye know that water &gt;&gt; summer is nine. &gt;&gt; So Jesus is telling us learn the fig tree. Whenever you see something happening to the fig tree, you can predict what is happening next. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. If you see the fig tree in with the leaves begin to bad and everything, you automatically know that you know what? Spring is coming. &gt;&gt; And when you see spring, you automatically know that what? Summer is coming. And when you come into summer, you know that it don't it won't take too long. Fall is coming. When you get in fall, you know that winter is coming. It's all clear. &gt;&gt; Brother Steven, Jesus says again in Luke right here about the same thing. He said, "And he spake to them a parable, saying, behold what?" &gt;&gt; fig tree. &gt;&gt; And all the trees, &gt;&gt; not only the fig tree now, but every single trees, when they now shoot forth, ye see, and know of your own self that water &gt;&gt; summer is now at. &gt;&gt; In other words, when you investigate, when you observe all the trees, you can tell which season is coming. &gt;&gt; Are we together? I know you want a specific instruction for men, but I'm going with trees &gt;&gt; because a tree represent man. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; A tree represent you. &gt;&gt; Amen. When you begin to put forth bad, something is happening. When a young man begin to change his voice. [Applause] &gt;&gt; When a young boy that used to be mommy mommy mommy mommy and suddenly he's like mom it's a season that is happening. Amen. &gt;&gt; A young sister that used to be looking slam and suddenly she begin to have some excellent tournament a season. Oh, she begin to b &gt;&gt; this is what the Bible say. Amen. It is telling you she's entering a season. [Applause] &gt;&gt; If mommy is distracted or daddy's distracted, they will miss the proper instruction. to give to the children at that specific time. &gt;&gt; In other words, when the voice have changed, it is time for daddy to talk to the boy. &gt;&gt; When the excellent tournament begin to come up, it's time for mommy to set the girl aside &gt;&gt; and begin to give her instruction of the future. &gt;&gt; It doesn't mean the boy is ready to get married. It doesn't mean the young 13 years old is ready to get married but you are preparing them for the oncoming &gt;&gt; for the next &gt;&gt; for the next season &gt;&gt; because I I mean puberty is telling you the next season &gt;&gt; spring is talking about summer &gt;&gt; puberty is talking about marriage &gt;&gt; but it's not marriage yet &gt;&gt; but if you see you lose the opportunity somebody else will teach your children. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; The internet will teach your children. &gt;&gt; Your neighbor will teach your children. &gt;&gt; The education in school will teach your children. &gt;&gt; So, we need to stay alert. &gt;&gt; And watch the symptom. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Why do we do a baby shower? because somebody's coming &gt;&gt; the that person have not come out yet &gt;&gt; but that person is announcing the coming &gt;&gt; so we don't want that person to come and we are not prepared &gt;&gt; are we together I'm going elementary so we can pick it up Jesus says this my friend in the book of Luke 12:54 he said and he said also to the people when We see a cloud do what &gt;&gt; rise out of the west &gt;&gt; straight away he say there come a water &gt;&gt; shower. &gt;&gt; In other word we are professional about discerning everything else except our lives. [Music] &gt;&gt; If you look at the weather it's going to rain. &gt;&gt; Who taught you that? &gt;&gt; Which school did you go to? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But when they say discern my life how am I going to discern my life by Steven? How should I know what the season is? How did you know the other stuff? Who taught you that? &gt;&gt; Amen. Jesus says, "And when he see the south wind doing what?" &gt;&gt; He said, "There will be what?" &gt;&gt; And it come to pass. In other words, it happened. &gt;&gt; Amen. Your weather man. &gt;&gt; Your weather man can even predict a hurricane. &gt;&gt; And they will tell you that hurricane will pass this way. And it happened. Amen. &gt;&gt; Men with intelligence &gt;&gt; begin to predict what is coming up. &gt;&gt; What about spiritual people? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Jesus say, "Ye hypocrite. &gt;&gt; Ye can discern the what? &gt;&gt; The face of the sky &gt;&gt; and of what? &gt;&gt; The earth, &gt;&gt; but how is it that you do not discern this time?" &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In other words, Jesus is saying, if you can discern all of this, &gt;&gt; how come &gt;&gt; you cannot discern the time? Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In other words, God already train you &gt;&gt; by the discernment of natural things &gt;&gt; for a purpose. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; William Marion Brham. Don't worry my friend. Brother Brham is the in the message the uniting time and son. Brother Brham say we are talking of this uniting &gt;&gt; uniting what? the son of the uniting time. See, Jesus was here in this last scripture reading. He was rebuking the clergy for not being able to discern the time &gt;&gt; or the son of the time. &gt;&gt; Now, that has always been a great thing to the people. See, to be able to do what? &gt;&gt; Discern the sign. &gt;&gt; Discern the sign of the time that you are living. Because God ride it how &gt;&gt; so that nobody could escape it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In other words, God put everything plan &gt;&gt; that no one will be without excuse. &gt;&gt; God is speaking. When you going out, God is talking. &gt;&gt; When you watch the television, God is talking. &gt;&gt; When you go to Walmart, God is saying something. &gt;&gt; But we don't know how to read it. Yes. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; And sometimes season comes a change in season comes in a sign of trouble. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Amen. &gt;&gt; The season you are acquainted with is when everything is moving smoothly. &gt;&gt; Ah, it's a season. &gt;&gt; Ah, it's a season. Ah, it's a season. Ah, it a season. But season also changes by trouble. &gt;&gt; I'm I'm getting there. Amen. And that one is the hardest one &gt;&gt; for the Christian to get it. &gt;&gt; Because the devil already work on our mind for so long. &gt;&gt; The devil already work on preachers for so long. &gt;&gt; Amen. And we are wired to only look on the negative. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When you sit at your doctor, &gt;&gt; go ahead, brother. &gt;&gt; What is the doctor looking for? &gt;&gt; Something good. &gt;&gt; I'm asking you a question. &gt;&gt; The doctor is trying to find out. What? &gt;&gt; When you sit at your dentist and you open your mouth, what is the dentist screening your teeth for? &gt;&gt; To find something good. &gt;&gt; He's trying to find what? &gt;&gt; So, we are trained to see bad. Have I said something wrong? &gt;&gt; Have I said something wrong? &gt;&gt; If you go to a mar to a reception and everybody's dressed well, everybody look beautiful and nice and one person maybe a sinner walk out there and dress wrong. You will forget everybody else. &gt;&gt; You will remember only that woman that came in that was dressed wrong. How was the party? The party was good, but there was a woman. I'm telling you that bad. &gt;&gt; Am I saying something wrong? &gt;&gt; Are we together? If I tell you what, I'm I'm taking off, my friend. What do you see here? &gt;&gt; What do you see here? &gt;&gt; What do you see here? &gt;&gt; And what do you see here? &gt;&gt; Why? Why you don't see this? Why you don't see all of this? &gt;&gt; What do you see? &gt;&gt; What do you see? &gt;&gt; Everybody say I see a dot. &gt;&gt; Nobody say I see a big white board with a dot. &gt;&gt; But the dot have taken over everything. &gt;&gt; So your focus is wrong. [Applause] &gt;&gt; I'm leaving the airport, my friend. Your focus is wrong. You focus too much on the wrong thing &gt;&gt; and the focus on the wrong thing make you lose everything here. [Applause] &gt;&gt; You will miss your husband for one dot. Because according to the message the according to the message people your husband must be perfect. &gt;&gt; And now the young man need to act hypocritically. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Are we are we together? &gt;&gt; He might be not talking a good English but he have a golden heart. You can meet your wife for one &gt;&gt; what we are looking at. We want the board to be clear. &gt;&gt; And then when we see the white the black dot, we know what to work on. &gt;&gt; We don't want a black board &gt;&gt; with a white dot. &gt;&gt; We want a white board. But we know there are some imperfection. But where as time goes on, God will iron those imperfection and make us looking good. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Open your Bible. &gt;&gt; Let's go to the book of Exodus. Thank you. We took off the airport. We're still climbing, my friend. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's go to Exodus. Exodus chapter 1. &gt;&gt; We're talking about the right focus &gt;&gt; in season. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know the whole story how Israel move. Uh-huh. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Last Sunday we talk about Samson. &gt;&gt; The the the the the most horrible time of Samson was only a shift &gt;&gt; from natural eye &gt;&gt; to faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When Joseph was changing his garment, &gt;&gt; he always took trouble. Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This brother hated him, sold him. &gt;&gt; And the Bible say, I believe it was Reuben or someone say that Joseph begged them. &gt;&gt; It's written in the Bible. &gt;&gt; The Bible say he besought them please, please, please no out &gt;&gt; that is not here. Ah &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus, where are you? You the present help in the time of trouble. &gt;&gt; It looks like the help is not there. Amen. &gt;&gt; Leader did Joseph knew &gt;&gt; that he was shifting season &gt;&gt; when he got in body for how everything good &gt;&gt; to shift the season and &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So season changes sometime with &gt;&gt; troublemen &gt;&gt; with tragedy. [Applause] I'm teaching you how to discern season &gt;&gt; in every way. &gt;&gt; It might change when it's good time &gt;&gt; but also when bad time are coming. Watch out. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Israel moved to Egypt. &gt;&gt; We clear? &gt;&gt; Let me drop this. How did Joseph go to Egypt? &gt;&gt; What happened to his family? What happened to him? &gt;&gt; He was sold because of hatred. &gt;&gt; It took hatred &gt;&gt; and jealousy. &gt;&gt; That's what happened. &gt;&gt; It took hatred. Follow me, my friend. It took hatred &gt;&gt; and jealousy to move Israel &gt;&gt; to Egypt. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; It took hatred. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And jealousy &gt;&gt; and a prophet &gt;&gt; to move Israel, not just Joseph. Because at the end of the day, the whole the whole village &gt;&gt; moved to Egypt. &gt;&gt; But for God to move them, God didn't come and say, "Hey, thus say the Lord, arise and all of you go to Egypt." &gt;&gt; It took hatred. &gt;&gt; It took jealousy. It took a prophet &gt;&gt; by the name of Joseph to move Israel toward Egypt. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; Are we together? And Joseph later on say that it was God &gt;&gt; that did it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's it's in your Bible, my friend. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, if it took hatred, &gt;&gt; we we are together. &gt;&gt; And jealousy and a prophet to move Israel to Egypt. What do you think need to to beh &gt;&gt; to take Israel from Egypt back to the promised land? &gt;&gt; The prophet here is Joseph. &gt;&gt; I'm going to go slowly again because some didn't catch &gt;&gt; for Israel. You know the whole story. I'm trying to save time so we can move on. You know the whole story. It took hatred of Joseph brother. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It took jealousy of Joseph brother. And it took the prophet himself to push Israel toward Egypt. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Until the whole tribe, everybody everybody went and stay right there. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; And even Joseph was dead and buried Egypt. Yes. &gt;&gt; And he said, "When you go out and pick up my bones, &gt;&gt; if it takes these three element &gt;&gt; to bring Israel to Egypt, &gt;&gt; what do you think would take to bring Israel from Egypt back to the promised land? &gt;&gt; It must be what? &gt;&gt; It must be what? &gt;&gt; It must be hatred &gt;&gt; from the Egyptian. It must be jealousy &gt;&gt; because because Israel begin to prosper &gt;&gt; and he must be a prophet &gt;&gt; by the name of Moses. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; So if Israel is really spiritual when they begin to see jealousy &gt;&gt; and hatred &gt;&gt; and a profit on the sin. It means it's what? &gt;&gt; It's a different season. &gt;&gt; I don't know if we together. &gt;&gt; I &gt;&gt; don't worry my friend. &gt;&gt; Don't worry, my friend. &gt;&gt; If he takes hatred, &gt;&gt; jealousy &gt;&gt; and profit. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Alpha. to take Israel back to Egypt to Egypt. &gt;&gt; To move Israel from Egypt &gt;&gt; back over there, he must take Omega. &gt;&gt; That's right. If it took the son of man ministry to bring the resurrection of the dead &gt;&gt; and Ephesis people die, people die. Tatian people die to raise everybody else. It must take what kind of ministry? &gt;&gt; Watch what brought you where you are. Amen. &gt;&gt; Watch what push you toward where you are. &gt;&gt; God will use the same thing to pull you out. &gt;&gt; Some of you are not catching. &gt;&gt; Let's go to the scripture. &gt;&gt; Exodus chapter one. &gt;&gt; If you there, you can say amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; I hope I won't be too long. &gt;&gt; Exodus 1 verse 6. If you dare, you can say amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And Joseph did what? &gt;&gt; Die. &gt;&gt; Uh-huh. Everything is good. And all his brethren and all that what? &gt;&gt; Generation. &gt;&gt; In other words, that whole generation, everybody did. &gt;&gt; We clear? &gt;&gt; Are we clear? &gt;&gt; And the children of Israel were how &gt;&gt; fruitful. &gt;&gt; Fruitful where? &gt;&gt; In Egypt. &gt;&gt; Not in the promised land. fruitful in Egypt. &gt;&gt; Even after the death of Joseph, &gt;&gt; Israel was prospering. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; And increased in water, &gt;&gt; abundant &gt;&gt; and multiply and what succeedingly what mighty &gt;&gt; and the land was filled with them. &gt;&gt; In other words, a new nation came to this nation and then and that small nation is taking over. A young boy came to the family of 10 &gt;&gt; and now he's taking off our daddy. &gt;&gt; So Israel begin to go and the Egyptian are looking at them like &gt;&gt; Lord I don't know what's going on with that Egyptian. We used to be friend &gt;&gt; but since I open five business I don't know what's going on. &gt;&gt; There was a season &gt;&gt; a season was changing. &gt;&gt; We're going to get somewhere. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And verse 8 the Bible say and there arose up a what? &gt;&gt; A new king over Egypt &gt;&gt; which knew not what? &gt;&gt; Joseph. &gt;&gt; How can a king I mean who's here who doesn't know I mean George Washington. Who's here who doesn't know George Washington? Who's here who doesn't know George Washington? How can a king arose after everything that Joseph did and saved the entire world and a king rose and did not know Joseph? If you look here, all that the Bible is saying is a king rose. &gt;&gt; So when you look, you say, "Lord, for some reason there is a new king right here. He doesn't like us. &gt;&gt; This is the devil, &gt;&gt; man. This is the devil. We need to pray for this king because Satan is using him so much. &gt;&gt; We clear, right? &gt;&gt; We clear so far. &gt;&gt; We clear right &gt;&gt; now. Let's go to Acts 7. According to Exodus, we were fine. &gt;&gt; We were at peace. We were prospering. And suddenly, the devil is bringing a king. Yes. &gt;&gt; And that king now is putting everybody uncomfortable. &gt;&gt; Let's go to Acts chapter 7, my friend, &gt;&gt; as we dragging. Amen. We moving. &gt;&gt; You there? &gt;&gt; Act chapter 7. If you dare, you can say amen. &gt;&gt; Act chapter 7. Let's go to verse 17. If you there, you can say amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But We clear? Ah, praise the Lord, my friend. Hallelujah. But &gt;&gt; when the what? &gt;&gt; Time of the promise. &gt;&gt; When the time of the promise did what? &gt;&gt; True. Now, &gt;&gt; so now Stephen is opening a different angle. He said, "Hey, before you focus on the Pharaoh, &gt;&gt; before you focus on the hatred, &gt;&gt; before you focus on the jealousy, &gt;&gt; before you focus on how bad Pharaoh, how ungrateful &gt;&gt; is Pharaoh after everything we did to his nation?" Before you begin to focus about that, Stephen say, "Watch out." &gt;&gt; Amen. There is something that happened in the spiritual realm. &gt;&gt; Are we together? What happened in the spiritual realm is what? The time &gt;&gt; of the promise did what? &gt;&gt; In other words, another season was approaching. &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. &gt;&gt; Another spring was approaching. &gt;&gt; Are we together? Stephen says, "But when the time of the promise did what? Junah which God swn to what? &gt;&gt; Abraham. &gt;&gt; So Stephen is first going to the covenant. &gt;&gt; Yes, that's right. &gt;&gt; Son to Abraham. Come the people did what? &gt;&gt; Grew and multiplied in Egypt. So the people in other words there was an anointing of blessing &gt;&gt; that came and Israel did not understand why they are multiplying &gt;&gt; but he was a son &gt;&gt; that the time of the promise was approaching &gt;&gt; and God must do something in Israel that will raise jealousy &gt;&gt; and hatred. &gt;&gt; I'm going somewhere my friend. &gt;&gt; We clear? Wow. &gt;&gt; Verse 8 uh 18. Until what? &gt;&gt; Another king arose. &gt;&gt; So the king didn't just come like that. &gt;&gt; Before the king arose. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The promise, the timing, the season was already changing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And when the season begin to change, Israel begin to b &gt;&gt; and to shoot forth. I hope you are understanding me. &gt;&gt; And to bring forth. Then suddenly a king is following the prosperity. The Bible say until another king arose which knew not what &gt;&gt; so according to act it is not just the king arose. &gt;&gt; No it is connected to a change in time &gt;&gt; to a change in season. The time has come &gt;&gt; that something must happen. &gt;&gt; Are we clear so far? &gt;&gt; Now let's go to the book of Romans. Romans chapter nine very easy my friend then we will sore if you there you can say amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Roman chapter 9 verse 16. If you there you can say amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The Bible say so then it is not of him that wills &gt;&gt; or willth nor of him that do what? &gt;&gt; Runth. &gt;&gt; But it's of who? God that showeth mercy. &gt;&gt; Everything depend on who? &gt;&gt; God. &gt;&gt; We clear. &gt;&gt; Verse 17. For the scripture says to who? &gt;&gt; Pharaoh. &gt;&gt; That Pharaoh that didn't know Joseph. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; The scripture says to Pharaoh, even for this same what? &gt;&gt; Purpose &gt;&gt; have what? &gt;&gt; I raised him. &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. Who's I? &gt;&gt; God. &gt;&gt; God. He say even for the same purpose have I God raised you up. So who rose Pharaoh? &gt;&gt; Is he the devil? &gt;&gt; Are we clear now? &gt;&gt; Who's responsible for it? &gt;&gt; So if you look at Pharaoh angry toward you, &gt;&gt; who is behind that? Why is Pharaoh angry? &gt;&gt; Because a season &gt;&gt; is changing. &gt;&gt; Are we clear? &gt;&gt; Follow me, my friend. The Bible say, "Even for this same purpose have I raised you up that I may show my power in you." &gt;&gt; God chose Pharaoh &gt;&gt; to demonstrate his power through him. The very thing that is bothering you, it is God that chose it. &gt;&gt; It is God that brought it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You can look it as the devil &gt;&gt; or you can look it as God. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; If you keep focusing that it's the devil, &gt;&gt; you will miss the exodus. &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. I hope we are together. &gt;&gt; The Bible say he raised him up for what? To show my power in you that my what? &gt;&gt; My name might be declared to what? &gt;&gt; All the earth. &gt;&gt; Why didn't he use Abraham? &gt;&gt; Why didn't he use Joseph himself? He chose a pharaoh, &gt;&gt; a gentile. God pick him up that through that gentile, that bad man, that wicked man, God can use it so that his name &gt;&gt; can go up. &gt;&gt; So when you look at Pharaoh, what do you see? &gt;&gt; Do you see the devil or do you see God? &gt;&gt; But according to the Bible, it was God. &gt;&gt; But God was changing season. using something bad. &gt;&gt; The problem that is arriving in your life, &gt;&gt; they have a meaning. &gt;&gt; That's why the Bible say all things &gt;&gt; all things &gt;&gt; are working together for what? &gt;&gt; As bad as you look, there is a message. [Applause] Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Listen to brother Brandham. Glory to God. In the message, the exposition of the seven church ages. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Brham says this about season. Brother Brham say if I can just think of season, you can get a very good picture of this. The plant that you see growing in full strength when now &gt;&gt; in summer &gt;&gt; suddenly appear to be what? Going to &gt;&gt; autumn. &gt;&gt; You can't tell exactly when summer became autumn. &gt;&gt; You don't wake up in the morning and say winter. &gt;&gt; No. Winter give you signal. &gt;&gt; And the signal is for preparation. &gt;&gt; It's not really cold yet. It's not really snowing yet, &gt;&gt; but you can begin to feel the little chill &gt;&gt; and you begin to know that it's time to check your air conditioning. &gt;&gt; It is time to begin to buy the I mean a different change of clothing. &gt;&gt; Why? Because winter is coming. &gt;&gt; It's time to airate the ground &gt;&gt; because winter is coming. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Brother Brham say you can't tell exactly when summer became what? It just does what? &gt;&gt; That is how the ages are. Especially this water. &gt;&gt; That's true. &gt;&gt; So season fade into another season. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? In other words, you don't just change like this. &gt;&gt; No, no, no, no, no, no, no. If you very spiritual, you will begin to feel something is changing. &gt;&gt; And as it's changing, you are changing the corner. [Laughter] Hallelujah. Brother Brham says this. I know the devil is trying to fight you, but you will get it. &gt;&gt; The Bible say we notice before what? &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham comes, watch some of his laws. &gt;&gt; When you see the trees doing what? &gt;&gt; Putting forth. &gt;&gt; He says, you know that what &gt;&gt; summer is &gt;&gt; springtime is a sign &gt;&gt; of the introduction of summer coming on. &gt;&gt; Amen. [Applause] So when you begin to see springtime, you already know summer is coming. [Laughter] &gt;&gt; He say that is a law. It's always what &gt;&gt; happens that way. &gt;&gt; Why is brother Brandon praying for you? And he tells you when you begin to feel good, praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Huh? Brother Brandham say when your hand begin to move a little bit, what do you do? &gt;&gt; Why? &gt;&gt; Because it's not just going to be the finger &gt;&gt; after a while the hand. &gt;&gt; In other words, healing is coming. [Laughter] &gt;&gt; He says that is a law. He always does what? You don't have summer &gt;&gt; then about the time it gets winter then the leaves comes on. No, &gt;&gt; you have the leaf first &gt;&gt; because it's what? &gt;&gt; An introduction of his laws of water &gt;&gt; nature. &gt;&gt; That spring is doing what? &gt;&gt; He never fail. When you see the trees begin to get what &gt;&gt; tender &gt;&gt; around on the back and the little bird begin to swell, you know that it's a sign that spring is here is what &gt;&gt; coming in. &gt;&gt; So one season announces the next one. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says here he says and there shall be a fall and and there shall not be a fallout shelter that we shall need. There shall be a what? hand of God. &gt;&gt; For as I said at the beginning of the message, father as thy lift's life goes back to the root when he comes from and wait for what? &gt;&gt; Another season. &gt;&gt; We know that we are near what? &gt;&gt; Another season. &gt;&gt; We can feel the change of what? &gt;&gt; Atmosphere. &gt;&gt; Which atmosphere? &gt;&gt; Spiritual atmosphere. &gt;&gt; Not a natural atmosphere now, but a spiritual atmosphere. If you not, if you are spiritual enough, you can see even how a church is moving. &gt;&gt; You can feel the anointing is changing. &gt;&gt; You can feel that. No, no. The way we were in the hotel is not the way we are now. It is telling you a season is coming. There is a changes that is coming. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? Watch the atmosphere. &gt;&gt; Feel the atmosphere. The atmosphere tells you something. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Why is the devil so much on you? &gt;&gt; It looks like the more spiritual you get, the more the devil is multiplying. &gt;&gt; What is the devil after? &gt;&gt; Why is he multiplying the trouble? Because the devil sees something. &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. &gt;&gt; Why the struggle have increased? &gt;&gt; You thought when I consecrate myself then doors will be open. But the more you get deeper in God, the more the pressure is coming up. What is going on? You can focus on the symptom &gt;&gt; or you can focus on the right thing. &gt;&gt; But today we need to learn to focus on the right thing. [Applause] [Music] [Applause] &gt;&gt; Are we together? There is only one bird on the planet earth &gt;&gt; that love the storm. [Applause] The Bible say, &gt;&gt; the Bible say where the caucus is, &gt;&gt; who are you going to find &gt;&gt; in this church? The carcass is here. &gt;&gt; So who am I preaching to? &gt;&gt; Who am I preaching to? &gt;&gt; Who am I talking to? &gt;&gt; And there is only one bird that love the storm. When the storm is coming, the bird don't see storm. The the eagle sees the season. He said, "Come on. Come on." Because when he comes, the eagle takes the bed and he begin to sow. [Applause] [Music] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Are we together? Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; If the storm is not there, &gt;&gt; the eagle is working. &gt;&gt; The eagle is working. &gt;&gt; The eagle is working. The wigle is working. But the storm have energy. &gt;&gt; And when the storm come, the ego say, "It's my break time." &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; The eagle pick up the storm and just sit like this. And the storm is guarding the eagle. [Applause] [Music] Brother, &gt;&gt; brother, &gt;&gt; my brother, &gt;&gt; my sister, &gt;&gt; you were built for your storm. [Applause] &gt;&gt; No matter how much the storm pushes you, remind the devil, you are taking me to my destiny. Keep pressing. Keep pushing. I'm getting where I'm supposed to go. [Applause] [Music] &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; What are you looking at your problem? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When you look at your problem, what do you see? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Which caliber are you in? Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; If it's a crow, the crow hide. &gt;&gt; The hawk hide. &gt;&gt; Everybody run away. &gt;&gt; The ego sit and say, "Praise the Lord." &gt;&gt; Because these two things are going to get rest. &gt;&gt; There is something in you that use the negative energy to propel you toward the positive energy. [Applause] That's why That's why God never take trials from your life. [Applause] &gt;&gt; When Jesus saw his trial, &gt;&gt; he wanted to dodge. God said, "Remember who you are." &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "Father, not my will. &gt;&gt; Bring it on." When he took the trial, he went to see Abraham &gt;&gt; and he went to hell and did we took the trial of Jesus to bring the full redemption. [Applause] &gt;&gt; That's why the Bible say for the joy that was set before &gt;&gt; he despised the cross. &gt;&gt; He look at the cross he say oh no problem. Come on. &gt;&gt; Come on. I've been too low here working working. Come on. And suddenly poop. Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Ego say we praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Now the ego doesn't work. &gt;&gt; He's sorry. &gt;&gt; Stretch your feet. &gt;&gt; He s. &gt;&gt; In other words, in the trial, I don't pray anymore. [Music] &gt;&gt; I was praying before the trial. &gt;&gt; Now I don't pray. &gt;&gt; Take me. I will show you where we are. I was already prayed up. Now I can go through. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Listen to me, my friend. &gt;&gt; Jesus prayed in Gethsemane. &gt;&gt; Did you see Jesus praying at the cross? [Applause] &gt;&gt; When Jesus came down &gt;&gt; and he said, "Who do you look for?" &gt;&gt; Did you see him saying who? No, &gt;&gt; the people themselves went back &gt;&gt; when they cut the servant ear. &gt;&gt; Did you see Jesus saying in the name of Jesus Christ, &gt;&gt; he just pick up and put because he was already charged. He's now there is no more time. I'm already in trial. I don't have time to fast &gt;&gt; because he say he's the present help &gt;&gt; in the time of trouble. Let God be God. &gt;&gt; Don't help God. &gt;&gt; I hope you are together. &gt;&gt; Your trial is is gasoline. &gt;&gt; It's fuel. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Why should I panic anymore? It's already happening. That's the time you speak the word. &gt;&gt; Not pray. Speak the word. &gt;&gt; Joshua was in the middle of the battle. He didn't have time to say wait, &gt;&gt; wait two days he let me fast. &gt;&gt; He looked left and right. He said, "You know what? I'm on my post of duty. &gt;&gt; Sun, stop right there. Moon stop right there. He didn't even use the name of Jesus [Applause] &gt;&gt; because Joshua means Yeshua. It is the very name of Jesus [Applause] &gt;&gt; and you are Mrs. Jesus. [Applause] &gt;&gt; When the trial is coming, &gt;&gt; remember who you are. Let go. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. &gt;&gt; Focus on the right thing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Jesus, &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Why is it so dark now? &gt;&gt; Why does it look like things are I'm almost about to collapse? Yes, &gt;&gt; I feel like I'm about to blow up. &gt;&gt; What is going on? &gt;&gt; How do you call that blow up? It &gt;&gt; in other words, if God doesn't intervene now, I'm done. &gt;&gt; Really? &gt;&gt; Let me show you the explanation of that. &gt;&gt; William Marion Brham, &gt;&gt; we see what &gt;&gt; darkness &gt;&gt; doing what &gt;&gt; gathering. Now, &gt;&gt; what is it? It is light pressing &gt;&gt; against the darkness. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Who's pressing? &gt;&gt; Who's pressing? &gt;&gt; According to you, you thought the devil is pressing you. &gt;&gt; No, it is the God that you listen to. Every Wednesday and Sunday, &gt;&gt; his word is pressing the devil. [Music] [Applause] &gt;&gt; The Bible say brother Brandham say what is it's what &gt;&gt; doing what? &gt;&gt; One has to do what? &gt;&gt; All the quing things that has been what? &gt;&gt; Running through the night. When the sun do what? &gt;&gt; All the demon that have been running in your life, &gt;&gt; God send an anointed message &gt;&gt; and that message is pressing them. &gt;&gt; Pressing them, &gt;&gt; pressing them and they don't want to go. &gt;&gt; Are we together? Are we together? Brother say they take what &gt;&gt; when the light shine &gt;&gt; night and what? and dark. &gt;&gt; Night and light cannot exist in the same what? &gt;&gt; Light and darkness cannot exist where &gt;&gt; the same building. &gt;&gt; Do you know that you a building? &gt;&gt; Do you know that you are a building? &gt;&gt; You a temple. Do you know that? &gt;&gt; So light and darkness cannot stay in my temple. One must give away. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Light and darkness cannot exist in my house &gt;&gt; because that house God gave it to me. &gt;&gt; I'm not talking about your body. Your house a home. We cannot have two powers [Applause] &gt;&gt; in your apartment. &gt;&gt; You cannot have two powers. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham say light and dark cannot exist where &gt;&gt; in the same building. It is either water &gt;&gt; or it's water. &gt;&gt; And light is so much more powerful than darkness. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Are we together? Are we together? He says, "So is Christ &gt;&gt; how &gt;&gt; so much more powerful &gt;&gt; than what? &gt;&gt; All the enemies of the world." &gt;&gt; How many enemies? &gt;&gt; Where is Christed? Where is Jesus Christ at? &gt;&gt; So your Christ is more powerful than what? He's more powerful than your depression, &gt;&gt; than your high blood pressure, than your sugar, &gt;&gt; than your anemia, &gt;&gt; your eye problem, your crust is greater. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Bear with me my friend. Brother Brandham said, now we are taught by what? scientists &gt;&gt; that as the light begin to do what? &gt;&gt; Come. &gt;&gt; It does what? &gt;&gt; Denses the darkness. &gt;&gt; And the darkness do what? &gt;&gt; Gathers all of its host together &gt;&gt; to do what? &gt;&gt; Fight against the light. &gt;&gt; But the light will do what? &gt;&gt; Prevails &gt;&gt; and what? &gt;&gt; And comes on. &gt;&gt; So why is it darkness in your life? &gt;&gt; It is not that Satan is overwhelming you. &gt;&gt; It is the light of God is pressing Satan. [Applause] Are we together? &gt;&gt; And this happened before the day come. &gt;&gt; You didn't get me my friend. &gt;&gt; You didn't get me my friend. Listen to this my friend. The Bible brother say what makes it dark when days. What make what? &gt;&gt; Dark before a day. &gt;&gt; Dark when &gt;&gt; before day. &gt;&gt; So when you see too much darkness, what is behind it? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; When you see too much darkness, the devil is on me. Maybe I did something wrong. Satan is on. It's a change of season. &gt;&gt; It's a change of days. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham say what makes it dark when &gt;&gt; before a day &gt;&gt; it is what &gt;&gt; the darkest before a day. &gt;&gt; Where are you in your life? &gt;&gt; Is it too dark? &gt;&gt; Does it feel like it's so dark? &gt;&gt; There is a day there. &gt;&gt; If you don't know how to read the season, &gt;&gt; you will miss the season. &gt;&gt; You will focus so much on the dot. You will focus so much on the darkness, not seeing that God is compressing &gt;&gt; the darkness because he's about to &gt;&gt; rise. &gt;&gt; My friend, he says we are told by who? &gt;&gt; Scientists &gt;&gt; that it's the light doing what? &gt;&gt; Pressing &gt;&gt; and doing what? &gt;&gt; Coming on &gt;&gt; and doing what? &gt;&gt; Moving down. The sun is coming around water &gt;&gt; around the world. &gt;&gt; It's the light doing what? &gt;&gt; It's pressing the darkness. &gt;&gt; She's making what? &gt;&gt; Her last strike. &gt;&gt; She can't stand no more. &gt;&gt; Darkness can never stand. When &gt;&gt; in the presence of light, &gt;&gt; he cannot do it. Light is how &gt;&gt; 10 million times stronger than darkness. &gt;&gt; So light and darkness cannot dwell together. &gt;&gt; And when light begin to do what? &gt;&gt; Rise. &gt;&gt; Darkness do what? &gt;&gt; Settle. &gt;&gt; And what? &gt;&gt; And gets there. It's pressing it how &gt;&gt; together. &gt;&gt; So when you see things not working too good and it's getting worse. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. [Applause] &gt;&gt; There is a new day coming. &gt;&gt; There is a new day approaching. That's why it's getting dark. &gt;&gt; Because something is coming. Instead of focusing on the darkness, begin to prepare for the season. [Applause] &gt;&gt; And I thank God sister Joanne was dancing here. [Applause] Some of you are in a better health than her. You ashamed to dance. But if you recognize the time, you will know what to do. I am dancing because my day is coming. A new day is approaching. Press on. &gt;&gt; Are we together? Are we together? Are we together? &gt;&gt; Look outside. Why is this so bad? Why is the devil so bad? Why is sodomite so bad? Why is tattoo everywhere? A day is approaching. The rapture is approaching. So the the light is compressing the darkness. &gt;&gt; Are we together? Are we together? Focusing on the right thing in the season. Amen. [Applause] [Music] &gt;&gt; Father, help me. &gt;&gt; Let's go to the Bible. &gt;&gt; Take Jeremiah 27. &gt;&gt; Oh, God. [Music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Look your conversation &gt;&gt; what you talk about &gt;&gt; it's what has been preoccupying your mind &gt;&gt; all your conversation are complaint [Music] &gt;&gt; and according to you he appear like the pastor is good &gt;&gt; because you always come to the pastor &gt;&gt; and the pastor is the one telling you stuff to do. So what do I go myself through &gt;&gt; because I learn not to complain. &gt;&gt; It doesn't change anything &gt;&gt; because there are many time I seen this happen and God deliver me. This happened God deliver this happen God. It happened so many times. So I must reach a point that somebody is delivering me. [Applause] Yes sir. &gt;&gt; I went through so many problem and I came out of it. &gt;&gt; Who is this a circumcised Philistine? &gt;&gt; He delivered me from the lion. He delivered me from the bear. So what about this? [Applause] &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Let's go to Jeremiah 27. My friend, help me move. &gt;&gt; I reduced the material and put only one sheet &gt;&gt; and now we are right here. &gt;&gt; I removed the material on the other sheet. I kept it for another day. We are have barely half a day. Let's go to 27. Jeremiah 27. &gt;&gt; If you dare, you can say amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Verse four. If you dare, you can say amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; This is Jeremiah giving the word of the Lord and command to them. Buckle up, my friend. And then I'm going to move a little bit. Then after that, we turn toward the airport. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I know we got a word of baptism. Hang on. &gt;&gt; You need to go home with something. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And command them to say to their master, say what? &gt;&gt; Thus sayith the Lord of hosts, &gt;&gt; the God of what? Israel &gt;&gt; that shall say to your master. See, so who's talking? &gt;&gt; God who? The Lord of Israel. &gt;&gt; Follow me carefully. &gt;&gt; I have made the earth the man and the beast that are that are upon the ground &gt;&gt; by my what? &gt;&gt; Great power &gt;&gt; and by my what &gt;&gt; outstretched arm &gt;&gt; and I have given it to whom &gt;&gt; it seems what &gt;&gt; meet unto me. In other words, God is telling the nation, I am the God who created everything. &gt;&gt; And when I created everything, I'm sovereign &gt;&gt; by my sovereignty uh by my sovereignty, it means I give it to whomever &gt;&gt; I like. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I choose whoever I choose. &gt;&gt; You don't tell me what to do. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I say this one a singer, this one a preacher, this one a musician, this one will sit on the pews to say amen. It is God that chose that. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; You can cry all you want. It's chosen by predestination. &gt;&gt; You might as well enjoy your path &gt;&gt; than trying to be in somebody else party. [Applause] You go to sleep whenever you want. &gt;&gt; I don't go to sleep whenever I want. &gt;&gt; I go to sleep around 3:00 and I'm awake and I'm here preaching. &gt;&gt; But how do I do that? &gt;&gt; Because I didn't choose myself. &gt;&gt; That's why I have the power to do it. &gt;&gt; If you try, you will collapse. Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the Bible says in verse six, &gt;&gt; and now &gt;&gt; what? &gt;&gt; I giving &gt;&gt; I giving all this land into the hand of water. &gt;&gt; In other words, God is saying a season change. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. All of you have your countries &gt;&gt; free. &gt;&gt; But now me God &gt;&gt; who created everything &gt;&gt; who dispatched as I want I have decided that from this time on &gt;&gt; from this season &gt;&gt; every one of you &gt;&gt; I have given you to Nebuchadnezzar. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; A new season. &gt;&gt; Is Nebuchadnezzar a Jew? &gt;&gt; A what? A gentile &gt;&gt; was he praying God? &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; He was worshiping what? &gt;&gt; Why is God giving another worshiper? &gt;&gt; Everything. &gt;&gt; Focus on the right thing. &gt;&gt; Father, help me if I can drive. Now I have start preaching. &gt;&gt; Everything was the introduction. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Is Nebuchadnezzar a Christian? &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; Is he a Jew? &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; Is he an Israelite? &gt;&gt; No. He's a worshshiper of Adam. &gt;&gt; And instead of God taking the kingdom and giving to the king of Israel, God went to a gentile hidden &gt;&gt; and say me God &gt;&gt; I have given everything to Nebuchadnezzar. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I have picked Pharaoh. &gt;&gt; I God pick Pharaoh. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So watch how you are looking at Nebuchadnezzar. Amen. [Music] &gt;&gt; Because you're going to miss your season. &gt;&gt; Your blessing may now be, in other words, God is shifting from Israel &gt;&gt; to Babylon. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; If you remain in Israel, &gt;&gt; God is no longer there. [Applause] I can't move my friend. &gt;&gt; Help me move, Sister Teresa. &gt;&gt; Ah, Sister Teresa, say amen. &gt;&gt; Let's go, my friend. He says, "And now have I what?" &gt;&gt; Given all these lands &gt;&gt; to who? &gt;&gt; Into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar, &gt;&gt; the what? &gt;&gt; The king of Babylon. &gt;&gt; The king of what? &gt;&gt; Babylon. &gt;&gt; So to you when they say king of Babylon, &gt;&gt; but let me look at this king of Babylon. The king of Babylon. Kama. What? &gt;&gt; My servant. &gt;&gt; The servant of who? &gt;&gt; Who preached to him? &gt;&gt; Who converted him? &gt;&gt; But God is calling him what? &gt;&gt; So when you look at Nebuchadnezzar, who do you see? &gt;&gt; A hidden or a servant of God? &gt;&gt; If not, we won't finish this sermon. a heathen or a servant of God. &gt;&gt; Slow down. Let me let me let me bring a towok. &gt;&gt; So that will blow you very good and blow the devil that will cause problem. Keep your finger right there. Okay. Go to Ezekiel 9. Uh Ezekiel 29. &gt;&gt; Father help me. &gt;&gt; If you can go quickly so we can uh let you go home. Ezekiel 29. Brother Tony, I don't know how you preach here and finish your sermon. &gt;&gt; Ezekiel 29 verse 17. If you there you can say amen. The Bible say and it came to pass in the seventh and 20th year in the first month in the first day of the month the word of the Lord came to me saying what &gt;&gt; son of man &gt;&gt; Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon caused his army to serve a great service &gt;&gt; against Tyrus. Every head that was made bald, every shoulder was peeled. Yet he had no wages. God is saying they didn't pay in Nebuchadnezzar. &gt;&gt; He did service. They didn't pay him. &gt;&gt; He has no wages. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Nor his army for Tus for the service that he had served against it. &gt;&gt; So God is coming. He say Nebuchadnezzar did some work there. You didn't give him his paycheck. M &gt;&gt; is my Bible different than yours? &gt;&gt; Verse 19. Therefore, thus sayith the Lord. &gt;&gt; Behold, I will give the land of what? &gt;&gt; Egypt. &gt;&gt; To who? &gt;&gt; Nebuchadnezzar, &gt;&gt; king of Babylon, and he shall take her multitude and take what? &gt;&gt; Her spoil. &gt;&gt; And take what? &gt;&gt; Her praise. &gt;&gt; And it shall be the wage for his army. Amen. &gt;&gt; God is bringing the paycheck &gt;&gt; to Nebuchadnezzar. &gt;&gt; Am I reading a different Bible? &gt;&gt; Jump to verse 20. I have given him what? &gt;&gt; The land of Egypt &gt;&gt; for his labor. &gt;&gt; Wherewith he served &gt;&gt; against it because they wrote it for the devil. &gt;&gt; For me. &gt;&gt; They did the job for who? &gt;&gt; For me. So Nebuchadnezzar was working for who &gt;&gt; and God is coming to pay him. &gt;&gt; Let's go back to Jeremiah 29. Who did the work for God? &gt;&gt; Nebuchadnezzar. And God is coming to pay who? &gt;&gt; God is even coming. He say there were there were a shift a shift Nebuchadnezzar worked there. &gt;&gt; Did you pay him? &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; Oh no no no we didn't pay him. He said what? He worked for me. You know what? Ah, give him Egypt. &gt;&gt; So you see Nebuchadnezzar going to Egypt and overcoming Egypt. You say, "My, that is a powerful king." He's not powerful. All is coming from heaven. [Applause] &gt;&gt; And why is Nebuchadnezzar getting Egypt? God is giving him a salary. If God can give a salary to a hidden king &gt;&gt; for the service he done for you. &gt;&gt; What about you? [Applause] [Music] [Applause] &gt;&gt; I hope you are listening to me. Musician &gt;&gt; for the service you done for God. &gt;&gt; Technician. You who say amen. &gt;&gt; For the service you done for God. What do you think God will do? [Applause] &gt;&gt; He's rewarding a servant. &gt;&gt; But you are not servant. You are brother. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Now from today your perspective about Nebuchadnezzar change. &gt;&gt; So when you see Nebuchadnezzar coming to take Israel, &gt;&gt; what do you see? &gt;&gt; A disaster &gt;&gt; or it's a storm. It's a storm that is coming to pick you up &gt;&gt; because your blessing goes with that storm. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Brother Glenn, I moved the airplane, but it's not going. &gt;&gt; Fat attendant, prepare for landing. Hallelujah. Listen, my friend. Let's go to verse 6 of Jeremiah 29. Let's go, my friend. And now have I what? Giving &gt;&gt; all the land to who? &gt;&gt; Nebuchadnezzar. &gt;&gt; Nebuchadnezzar. Who? &gt;&gt; The king of Babylon. My servant. Jeremiah 27:6. My servant. And the beast of water. &gt;&gt; The field. &gt;&gt; Have I given him also to do what? &gt;&gt; Serve him. &gt;&gt; To what? &gt;&gt; Serve. &gt;&gt; To serve who? So who's subduing people &gt;&gt; to serve Nebuchadnezzar? &gt;&gt; Wait, wait for what is coming next. &gt;&gt; Okay, wait for what is coming next. Job to verse uh Oh Lord, help me up. Job to verse uh uh seven. And all nation &gt;&gt; shall do what? &gt;&gt; Serve him. &gt;&gt; And serve who? &gt;&gt; His son. &gt;&gt; And who? &gt;&gt; And his son's son. So there is a season &gt;&gt; that have opened. &gt;&gt; That season have Nebuchadnezzar, &gt;&gt; the son of Nebuchadnezzar and the great son of Nebuchadnezzar. &gt;&gt; So you need to watch &gt;&gt; those three king. &gt;&gt; You need to watch those three king. &gt;&gt; You need to watch Nebuchadnezzar. &gt;&gt; You need to watch his son. And then you need to watch his greatson. &gt;&gt; His grandson. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; So Nebuchadnezzar have a time. &gt;&gt; His son have a time. &gt;&gt; His great son have a time. &gt;&gt; All those are in one season. &gt;&gt; Why is that season important for you? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Uh verse seven. And all nations shall do what? &gt;&gt; Serve him. and water. &gt;&gt; His son &gt;&gt; and water &gt;&gt; his son's son &gt;&gt; until &gt;&gt; until &gt;&gt; the very time of what &gt;&gt; his land come. &gt;&gt; So until the time that that season will finish. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And then what? &gt;&gt; Many nations &gt;&gt; and what &gt;&gt; and great kings &gt;&gt; shall do what? &gt;&gt; Serve themselves of him. &gt;&gt; Verse eight. And it shall come to pass that the nation and the kingdom which shall not serve the same Nebuchadnezzar, the king of what? &gt;&gt; Babylon. &gt;&gt; And will not put their neck &gt;&gt; under the yoke of the king of Babylon. That nation will what? &gt;&gt; Punish. &gt;&gt; Who's going to punish the nation? &gt;&gt; God. So if you living in that time, &gt;&gt; where should you go? &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. Now you afraid. Repeat the Bible. If you [Applause] &gt;&gt; Is Babylon a good thing? &gt;&gt; It's a storm, &gt;&gt; but you need it. &gt;&gt; You need it. In other words, God is telling Israel, don't look at the storm &gt;&gt; of Babylon as a storm. &gt;&gt; The storm of Nebuchadnezzar is my servant. &gt;&gt; Ride under him. &gt;&gt; Ride on him. &gt;&gt; Where are we at? &gt;&gt; Eight. &gt;&gt; Eight. My friend, he says every nation, the king of Babylon, that nation will not do what? punish, &gt;&gt; says who? &gt;&gt; The Lord. &gt;&gt; With what? &gt;&gt; The sword &gt;&gt; and what? &gt;&gt; With the famine &gt;&gt; and with what? &gt;&gt; With pestilence. &gt;&gt; Until I have consumed them by his hand. &gt;&gt; In other words, if you refuse to get under Babylon, God himself come &gt;&gt; and kill you &gt;&gt; either by sword, &gt;&gt; either by famine or by sending disease. &gt;&gt; So where is safety now? What is the name of your storm? &gt;&gt; Nebuchadnezzar. &gt;&gt; Is it really Nebuchadnezzar? &gt;&gt; So, the anointing is on the storm. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; The anointing of God is on the storm. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; And God is saying, put your neck in that storm. &gt;&gt; Don't run away from it. Put it. &gt;&gt; If you stay in Israel, it will kill you. &gt;&gt; Amen. use that trial. [Music] &gt;&gt; Job to verse 11. Jump to verse 11. &gt;&gt; But the nation &gt;&gt; But the nation that bring their neck under the what? &gt;&gt; The yoke of the king of Babylon. &gt;&gt; And do what? &gt;&gt; And serve him. &gt;&gt; Those nation will do what? &gt;&gt; I let remain still in their own land. &gt;&gt; Say who? &gt;&gt; The Lord. &gt;&gt; They say they shall teal it and do what? &gt;&gt; And dwell there. &gt;&gt; If you want a peace, what do you do? Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Job 2:12. I spoke also to who? &gt;&gt; Zedekiah. &gt;&gt; King of what? &gt;&gt; Judah. &gt;&gt; According to what? &gt;&gt; All these words. &gt;&gt; Bring your neck &gt;&gt; under the yoke of what? &gt;&gt; The king of Babylon. &gt;&gt; And serve him and his people. And do what? &gt;&gt; And live. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Jeremiah went to the king of Judah. Say, "Hey, hey, you &gt;&gt; bring your neck. &gt;&gt; Bring your neck. &gt;&gt; The season have changed. &gt;&gt; You want to leave, bring your neck over there." &gt;&gt; So what look like bad? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Here's a season there. &gt;&gt; Let's go to Jeremiah 29. &gt;&gt; Beautiful. If I attended my friend, prepare for landing. &gt;&gt; If you dare, you can say amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Lord have mercy on me. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Verse 29. Verse one. Now these are the words of what? &gt;&gt; The letter &gt;&gt; of who? &gt;&gt; That Jeremiah the &gt;&gt; prophet sent to who? From what? &gt;&gt; Jerusalem. &gt;&gt; To do to what? &gt;&gt; To the residue of the elders which were carried away captives. &gt;&gt; Ah the elder that were carried away. How? &gt;&gt; Captives. Mhm. &gt;&gt; When you carry the way &gt;&gt; was there your own will? &gt;&gt; So the only way you can get where God want you to go somewhere &gt;&gt; sometime they got to take you against your will. &gt;&gt; If not Joseph won't go. &gt;&gt; So they must get you captive. &gt;&gt; Captive toward Babylon. But look at the mystery behind Babylon. It was God that was there. &gt;&gt; That's why Jeremiah sent the letter &gt;&gt; to those who areware. &gt;&gt; Those that are already under Nebuchadnezzar. &gt;&gt; Because those that were already under Nebuchadnezzar, &gt;&gt; amen, were still confused. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; They were still in Babylon and they are looking at uh at Canaan. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. So their mentality is &gt;&gt; the day I'm going to go to Kenan. &gt;&gt; The day I'm going to go to Kenan. &gt;&gt; The day I'm going to go to Canaan. I can't wait to go to Kenan. &gt;&gt; Let's wait. They say it's 2 years. They say it's 3 years. Why are you waiting? I'm not waiting. I'm waiting for the rapture. Hey, sorry. I'm waiting for the day to go to to Canaan &gt;&gt; because we are in Babylon. &gt;&gt; We need to go back to Canaan. Thank you. &gt;&gt; We are in modern Babylon. We need to go back to Canaan. &gt;&gt; I have my friend I have like 10 quotes that I can line you up one two three four if I'm not mistaken. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So the one that are in Babylon they don't understand that there is a season &gt;&gt; a season of Nebuchadnezzar his son and his great. So God give them three rain &gt;&gt; with his anointing there. &gt;&gt; Exactly right. &gt;&gt; I don't know if we together, &gt;&gt; but when they are sitting under the anointing, &gt;&gt; they don't see the anointing. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; They are seeing Canaan &gt;&gt; until in the book of Psalm &gt;&gt; they told them, "Hey, you &gt;&gt; we see you with uh brother Zach. We see you with a guitar. &gt;&gt; Can you play to us &gt;&gt; those song &gt;&gt; of &gt;&gt; Zion? &gt;&gt; Go ahead and sing. &gt;&gt; And do you know what they answer? &gt;&gt; Because of the overwhelming situation. &gt;&gt; They say no, I'm not in the position to sing. &gt;&gt; How can I sing the song of water &gt;&gt; in a water? Where was God? &gt;&gt; Worship the Lord. I'm going through a trial. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. I'm going through a problem. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Be happy. My husband left me. &gt;&gt; My wife left me. &gt;&gt; Ah, my children are not serving the Lord. &gt;&gt; No. No. No. In that strange land, &gt;&gt; in that bad situation, &gt;&gt; you will miss your season. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? So Jeremiah send letter. &gt;&gt; He say you over there. &gt;&gt; What are you doing? &gt;&gt; Nothing. &gt;&gt; Hh. Doing what? Nothing. &gt;&gt; Why? &gt;&gt; We are waiting to go back to Zion. &gt;&gt; To go where? &gt;&gt; Who told you you are leaving now? &gt;&gt; Who told you you are living now? &gt;&gt; So, so, so why do you leave? &gt;&gt; No, we are renting uh and motel here. motel and what? No, no, no. We ended up uh uh uh uh uh uh renting a land that all of us are living in the camp together to keep uh us together. &gt;&gt; So that's why we are waiting because we need to go back. This is not our home. [Music] &gt;&gt; The anointing struck Jeremiah. &gt;&gt; Jeremiah said, "Bring bring me the pen. Bring me the pen. Let me write them a letter. &gt;&gt; As a major prophet, &gt;&gt; as the mouth of God, &gt;&gt; let me tell them what to do in Babylon. &gt;&gt; I'm reading the Bible. &gt;&gt; What do you do in Babylon? &gt;&gt; Job to verse four, my friend. &gt;&gt; What do you do in Babylon? &gt;&gt; Thus says the Lord of hosts. &gt;&gt; Thus says who? &gt;&gt; The Lord of hosts. &gt;&gt; Is it Jeremiah talking? &gt;&gt; Who's talking? Thus say the Lord of hosts the what? &gt;&gt; The God of Israel &gt;&gt; to who? &gt;&gt; All that are carried away captive. &gt;&gt; Everybody that is in Babylon doing nothing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Waiting for the rapture. &gt;&gt; I will get to that &gt;&gt; online. Don't be too quick. I'm loaded. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Everybody that are there &gt;&gt; that are sitting there. He says all that are carried away how &gt;&gt; captives &gt;&gt; whom are whom what &gt;&gt; I have caused to be carried away from Jerusalem. &gt;&gt; Who caused &gt;&gt; God? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Who caused you to go to Babylon? &gt;&gt; Amen. Lord &gt;&gt; who caused you to pass through that storm? &gt;&gt; Do you think he doesn't know what he's doing? &gt;&gt; Because the footstep of the righteous are ordered by who? &gt;&gt; Why are you traveling the the family you are going to? &gt;&gt; It it just happened like that. &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; Did you choose your daddy? &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; Did you choose your mommy? &gt;&gt; Why did they put you under that daddy and that man [Applause] &gt;&gt; and you keep looking? My daddy is a drunker. My daddy was a drunker. My daddy was a drunker. Leave the drunkenness. [Applause] My mama was a single mama. My mama was a single mama. My mama was a single mama. You sang that song for so long. &gt;&gt; There is a purpose why they put you and the single mama &gt;&gt; and the single daddy. [Applause] &gt;&gt; I have opened up the wheels of the airplane. Are we together? &gt;&gt; What do you do whom I have caused to do what? &gt;&gt; To be carried away captive &gt;&gt; to &gt;&gt; from Jerusalem unto Babylon. &gt;&gt; To Babylon. So when Nebuchadnezzar was coming, &gt;&gt; who did you see coming? &gt;&gt; Now, now you know God now. &gt;&gt; Now you know God. Now &gt;&gt; when the trial was coming, you called that the devil. &gt;&gt; You give so much credit to the devil. Even the trial that are bringing your blessing are always the devil &gt;&gt; because you see the devil everywhere. &gt;&gt; You see the devil in the cut, the devil in the dock, the devil in the police officer, the devil at the restaurant. You see the devil everywhere. &gt;&gt; When the traffic happen, it's the devil. You don't know if it's a protection for an accident. It's the devil. &gt;&gt; The supervisor don't like me. The devil. &gt;&gt; Who's who is in control of your life? So the devil. &gt;&gt; But today refocus your camera. &gt;&gt; Are we together? Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Because it's too much complex &gt;&gt; among among message believer. Too much complex among message believer. I made a mistake. I believe I made a wrong choice. I believe I [Music] [Applause] &gt;&gt; So you telling God there are certain things that God do and certain things God is unable to do. That's the territory of the devil. &gt;&gt; Are we together? Look how much you beaten yourself down. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And waiting to go back to Isaiah. So there is no no push in you &gt;&gt; no ability to move in life &gt;&gt; because you stuck &gt;&gt; waiting for the rapture waiting for the for the for the deliverance [Music] &gt;&gt; uh where are we at my friend so you can go home verse uh four verse five that say the Lord do what &gt;&gt; build Be houses &gt;&gt; beat houses where &gt;&gt; oh oh continue renting. &gt;&gt; We in Babylon. Continue renting. Continue renting. My friend built houses. In other words, Jeremiah sent the instruction. He said, "What are you doing over there sitting like that? &gt;&gt; Who told you you coming now? &gt;&gt; There is a season. &gt;&gt; Built houses there. &gt;&gt; Stop looking at Nebuchadnezzar the way you looking at him. As a matter of fact, you are brother Brandham used to use the word Ricky Ricky Ricky Rick Ricky Rick. God came down say stop that vocabulary. Those my children are there &gt;&gt; because you focusing on Nebuchadnezzar. Abanza captivity. Captivity. Captivity. Stop looking at Nebuchadnezzar like that. He's my servant. &gt;&gt; I gave everything to him &gt;&gt; and I carried you away captive under him. &gt;&gt; There is a purpose why I put you in Babylon. &gt;&gt; There is a purpose why you are in this Babylon. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Build houses. &gt;&gt; Build houses. &gt;&gt; Don't say amen. &gt;&gt; Build houses. &gt;&gt; Come out and do what? &gt;&gt; Did he say when you built the house, so when the time of Exodus will come, somebody will build your home or will go live in your house? &gt;&gt; Who's going to dwell there? If God tell you build a house &gt;&gt; and dwell in them, what does it mean to you? &gt;&gt; Ah, &gt;&gt; in other word, all of you have the potential for houses. &gt;&gt; I'm going to Let's stop. You don't get it. You don't get it. Let's stop right here. &gt;&gt; When they say when God come, &gt;&gt; can you go see brother Charles and say have a baby? &gt;&gt; Carry a pregnancy. &gt;&gt; Because in him he's not built beautiful. &gt;&gt; You can only tell a woman that is mature that &gt;&gt; are we together. So now God is telling all no exception everybody that is there &gt;&gt; in Babylon. God say built houses. So when you were going to Babylon, where were you carrying? [Applause] &gt;&gt; You were carrying houses that have to be built not in Canaan. &gt;&gt; In other words, when you enter Babylon, those houses were already activated &gt;&gt; and here you are renting. And God say ah look in you &gt;&gt; where you are there you got a house &gt;&gt; everybody can build a house [Applause] &gt;&gt; it doesn't soak in. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; When God say built a house and dwelt there, &gt;&gt; how did you came into Babylon? &gt;&gt; Captive. &gt;&gt; What does a captive carry? &gt;&gt; So, how can you tell a captive built a house? &gt;&gt; From where? &gt;&gt; Where does he get the money? &gt;&gt; So, what type of faith &gt;&gt; does a captive need to have in Babylon? [Music] [Applause] Come on. &gt;&gt; I'm going to the airport. &gt;&gt; Let me start it again. If not, I'm going to jump again and move them and circle the airport because I need to go straight to the tarmac. Let me start again. I'm already on bu I'm just in building the house and I will stop. Then we going to pick up the other one. Plant vineyard later. So build a house. When God tells you God is talking to who? When you were taken captive. Were you were you going on vacation? &gt;&gt; Did you have the time to sit down and prepare your luggages and say, "I need my perfume. I need this. I need this. I make sure all my scissors and everybody in there and my haircut and whatever and my be." Did you have time to get it? &gt;&gt; They were picking you up. How? &gt;&gt; Captive. So, you were going how? &gt;&gt; How were you going to Babylon? &gt;&gt; Unprepared. &gt;&gt; Unprepared. &gt;&gt; Because God don't want you to depend. on your ability. &gt;&gt; Come on, brother. &gt;&gt; Spoken way. &gt;&gt; There is a reason why God have to snatch you like that. &gt;&gt; Do you know he told the the disciple go preach &gt;&gt; and they want to preach, he say, hey, hey, give me your wallet. &gt;&gt; Leave your wallet here. &gt;&gt; Hey, &gt;&gt; we going to preach the gospel. Leave your wallet. Uh, I'm going to get my suit. &gt;&gt; How many are you taking? &gt;&gt; One. Leave the other. No. No. But it will be a convention. Leave your suit there. &gt;&gt; But about money. Jesus said, "Don't take money." &gt;&gt; What was he training his disciple? [Applause] &gt;&gt; In other words, where you going? What is there? &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. So God was changing this captive &gt;&gt; from a state to a different state &gt;&gt; from a state on depending on Israel &gt;&gt; to a state where they must depend on God &gt;&gt; because they weren't empty &gt;&gt; and God yet tell them build a house. &gt;&gt; How are you going to build a house when you were taken captive? Right? &gt;&gt; It means that it takes a different faith in Babylon. &gt;&gt; It takes a faith that believe the word and call on things that are not &gt;&gt; as though they are. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. So when the letter is coming from Jeremiah and say build a house and dwelling the question is who say that? The Bible say thus save the Lord. &gt;&gt; If it does that say the Lord and he reach my ear &gt;&gt; it is &gt;&gt; whether there is money &gt;&gt; whether there is no money &gt;&gt; whether I have established a credit &gt;&gt; in Babylon or no credit in Babylon. All I need is that safe the Lord. &gt;&gt; Because I got that safe the Lord &gt;&gt; from that time on. &gt;&gt; I'm going to build a house. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; In other words, God already anointed those people &gt;&gt; with a special anointing &gt;&gt; to fulfill certain things in Babylon. But the people were sitting doing nothing. &gt;&gt; The people were confused doing nothing and losing the opportunity &gt;&gt; to transform their life &gt;&gt; with the power of transformation &gt;&gt; that went with them &gt;&gt; the money was there. &gt;&gt; When I say this, you don't understand me. But in Revelation 17, we are in mystery Babylon. &gt;&gt; And this is we are in mystery Babylon. All your banking system &gt;&gt; is controlled by the harot. &gt;&gt; It depends on how you look it. &gt;&gt; I don't care what the hallot is. &gt;&gt; My point is who is God &gt;&gt; and what is God telling me at this time? Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? Why did he send me thy word &gt;&gt; like this word &gt;&gt; in the midst of Babylon? &gt;&gt; There must be a season. &gt;&gt; I will get to that next time the Lord willing. Let's stop here, my friend. &gt;&gt; Let's stand. [Applause] [Laughter] But you understand &gt;&gt; what to focus on. &gt;&gt; You understand what you're looking at. &gt;&gt; Don't make a decision based on Trump. &gt;&gt; Leave Trump alone. &gt;&gt; He already gave you signal. &gt;&gt; The last Trump and then this this this. Leave him alone. &gt;&gt; You will get upset unnecessarily. &gt;&gt; You will blow your TV. &gt;&gt; You will get upset against nature now. &gt;&gt; You wasting your time &gt;&gt; focusing another thing &gt;&gt; and look what is going on now. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; I have a scripture. &gt;&gt; Every single king, God is directing them. &gt;&gt; I have a Bible scripture. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because your question is why did he use Nebuchadnezzar? I can show you in the Bible. I have a time is gone. &gt;&gt; The Bible say the heart of the king now is are in the hand of God. It's written in your Bible. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He choose who's going to be where. Not you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; If they give you your choice, we will put message believer everywhere. &gt;&gt; The prime minister will be a message believer. The president will be a message believer. All the Supreme Court will be message believer. Uh uh God, it doesn't work like that. [Laughter] &gt;&gt; Amen. If they give you everywhere message believer, God don't work like that. God take a hidden and put him there &gt;&gt; and you keep focusing on the hidden. And all you see is bad. &gt;&gt; You're missing the good thing that are going on. &gt;&gt; You're missing five years. &gt;&gt; We miss millions. &gt;&gt; We did miss millions. &gt;&gt; What were we looking at? &gt;&gt; What were we looking at? &gt;&gt; Who what was distracting you? &gt;&gt; Huh? Stay focused. &gt;&gt; God willing, we will pick up on this story and we will continue down to see what causes us to miss this type of stuff. Amen. &gt;&gt; And you will see. And remember who took Israel to Egypt? &gt;&gt; No. Naturally, &gt;&gt; Joseph. Hatred. And what? Jealousy. How did Israel come back? &gt;&gt; In the book of Jeremiah, who picked Israel from the promised land? &gt;&gt; No. No. Naturally, &gt;&gt; a king called who? &gt;&gt; I will show you next Sunday. Who took Israel back? If Israel went with a king, who's going to &gt;&gt; who's going to take Israel back? &gt;&gt; And I will show you who is that king before God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When you see a storm, what do you call it? When you see pressure, what do you call it? &gt;&gt; When you see something bad, what do you call it? &gt;&gt; And it's heading toward me. &gt;&gt; You heading toward me. &gt;&gt; You do, my friend, &gt;&gt; you're going to turn into a blessing. [Music] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's built for you. Let's pray. Heavenly Father, Lord, we approaching you humbly this afternoon.
