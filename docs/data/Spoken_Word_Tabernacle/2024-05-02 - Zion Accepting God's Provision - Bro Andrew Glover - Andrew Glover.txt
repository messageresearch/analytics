TRANSCRIPT
========================================
to do swinging your hands and everything else you know like the preachers done I thought I'd done just every one of them I'd watched him and done just what he did he said worst I ever heard I said Brother Davis he said I never heard such in my life he said a young man I wanton you meet me in my study tomorrow afternoon at 2:00 I oh M so 2:00 I went down my feathers all pulled over you know I said good evening Dr David said how do Billy sit down I said yes sir he said I guess your feelings is hurt I said they're just stepped on that was all I said what what did I do wrong he said I w't tell you a little story he said you know I studied was a lawyer before I was a minister I said yes sir I know that he said Billy one time I studied the law and I did it just the way you did the Bible or way you studied about the ministry he said I thought that I was a lawyer and I swore into the bench he said I got up there and pleading a divorce case one time my first case and said I'd see those lawyers beat on the table like that and your honors are judge and cry and wipe their face off with yours this poor little woman she's so and so and like that said after a while the old attorney was my opponent on the other side said he just sat and watch me for a long time said I cried I beat the desk and done everything just like the lawyers did and said my uh uh the old opponent said over there

whipped out he said I learned something then you see he and I asked the judge he said not and said the attorney too was a friend of mine but said he come down there and said Roy I did that purposely said you see you were going through emotions you were crying shaking your head and beating it said I do just like the other lawyers do he said but you wasn't putting one IE OD of law into it it's not how your emotions that wins the case it's the verdict of the law you got to know what the law says about it and that's the same way said about you said Billy you shook your head and you cried and

and just hearing brother Steven there speaking in the back room about the sermon on on Sunday I believe he was maybe in adoption or skillful Tre teaching or something like that amen speaking on

Jimmy back there it's good to see you my friend and amen just a just a wonderful time to get together amen amen let's look here tonight in the Book of Psalms the 23rd chapter and maybe before we read let's just ask the Lord to come and Quicken his word to our hearts Heavenly Father Lord as your spirit has settled down over this meeting tonight tonight father we are indeed grateful to be called your children and Lord we're thankful that we're able GA once again here on a Wednesday evening father as it was Lord that day on the Emmas road walk when you were walking with them Lord and it was in the evening time your Prophet said that they constrained you to come into that little room and Lord you walked in there and you took the bread and you begin to break it Lord and their eyes come open father we're gathered here once again tonight in that little room of your word father we're inviting you to come into our midst and take this broken bread of life and may you break it apart to our eyes Lord we don't want to leave here the way we came oh God lord we want to leave here changed we want to leave here edified so Lord may you come and be the speaker here tonight may you take the bread of life and break it Lord and our eyes will come open and we will see you in the power of your Resurrection we will see you as the Mighty God unveiled and Lord I pray you take these few things of inspiration that you've laid on my heart heart and Lord may you just place it in the hearts of your children and Lord whatever you have need of and whatever you want to see done in this service we'll be sure to give our rights to you come Among Us in a supernatural way heal our sick oh God Save The Lost father Lord may you fill with the Holy Ghost and Fire Lord May there come a refreshing from your presence oh God and we'll be sure to give thee all the praise all the honor and all the glory in the wonderful name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ we pray and all the Believers says amen and amen The Book of Psalms the 23rd chapter and in the first verse here I love the readings rather the writings of David uh because they're so powerful and here David is actually writing to us about the confidence he has in God's grace and he says here in Psalms 23:1 he says now the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want now I have to say it's astounding to me that David identifies the confidence in God's grace and starts writing about the provision of God if you read Psalms 23 he'll write about my soul is restored there's food in the presence of my enemies but what he's saying here is I have confidence in God's grace to provide now when you look at that word want the word want there means to diminish for lack of need so David is saying I shall not diminish for a lack of need but there's a God who will provide the need now in Psalms 132 right in Psalms 132 and beginning there in the 13th verse David here writing again and he says now the Lord hath chosen Zion he hath desired it for his habitation this is my rest forever here will I dwell for I have desired it now watch what he says I will abundantly bless her provision I will satisfy her poror with bread I will also clothe her priest with salvation and her Saints shall shout aloud for Joy thee will I make then there will I make the Horn of David to Bud for I have ordained a lamp for mine anointed I love Verse 18 and his enemies will I clothe with shame but upon himself shall his crown flourish amen the enemies are going to be cold in shame but upon David's head his crown amen is going to flourish now in the book of Philippians the 4th chapter Philippians chapter 4 and I know this is one verse here tonight that we everone amen that's ever read our Bibles we could read this verse from heart Amen in Philippians chapter 4 Amen in verse 19 Paul here writing in Philippians 4:19 and he says these words he says but my God shall supply all your need according to his riches in Glory by Christ Jesus amen let's just read that together but my God shall supply all your need according to his riches in Glory by Christ Jesus amen we ask the Lord this evening to add the blessing to the reading of his word as you can have your seats here this afternoon amen I want to by the help of the Lord for just a few moments this afternoon to speak to you here and if I title this tonight I want to talk to you about this amen Zion accepting God's provision amen Zion accepting God's provision brother B preaches a sermon and he calls it accepting God's provided way at the end time he said now for a text I would like to speak from on this is accepting God's provided way for the end time he said now let me quote that again because on the tapes I believe they're taping the messages and on the tapes we have some 500 texts that I guess I've preached from he said now they've got something similar to that amen but not exactly this they've got something similar to that amen but not exactly this accepting God's provided way at the end time now amen if you study the message you go all the way back in the 50s and brother's preaching messages like God's making a way or God's provided way God's provided a way of healing for this generation but then a prophet comes in 1965 and he says you've got tapes on this but not exactly this amen see accepting God's provided way at the end time goes on to say you know there's many ways that people take amen but there's really only two ways that a man can go so there's many ways that man can take but there's only two ways that man can go he said see that's the right way and the wrong way he said we're on one those roads the right or the wrong one see there's no middle ground because Jesus said you cannot serve God and Mammon which he was meaning the world he said see we're either right or we're wrong and now if we'll just get away from our own way is the only way we can get into God's way so the only way we can get into God's way amen is to get away from our own way and he says and God has made a provided way for everything amen he has provided the way amen so God has made the way in other words God has provided the way and where we get in trouble is not following that way and injecting into it our own ways and that makes a perversion and anything that's perverted is not Dependable amen so God has a way amen I'll say this tonight amen his ways are perfect amen his ways are not the ways of a man they're not the ways of a church but they are the Perfection Amen on display of the almighty God God now you know the Bible says in Proverbs 14:12 amen that there is a way which seeth right unto man amen but the end thereof are the ways of death amen now it's a it's astounding to me amen that there is a direct connection now amen between a man a way and a destination there's a man's way and it seems right into a man amen but watch the destination of a way that seeth right amen ends up in death can I say this amen there is a vast difference Amen in something that seems right amen and knowing something is Right amen let me say this denominations amen are walking in the way that seems right amen unto a man so if they're walking in a way that seems right that means they're walking without an absolute amen but I want to say we are not walking in a way amen which seems right amen but we are walking in a way that has been Vindicated amen as the right way amen I'll say this we are not walking in our choice amen but we are walking in God's choice amen denomination is walking in the ways of their own choosing of how to baptize of how to believe of how to pray of how to approach the word amen but there's a bride on the earth tonight amen who has died to her own thinking she has died to her own ways and she has come back to God's provided way amen and she is standing in the provision of God brother Bon all the denominational ages of 900 and something different Protestant denomination he said each one of them of course you could see their idea he said I cannot blame them amen each one claims that they are the truth amen that they have the truth and the people that belongs to those churches should believe that amen because they have stake their destination amen their Eternal destination upon the teaching of that church amen and there's so much different one from the other till it makes n 900 and something different questions amen got 900 denominations amen walking in the way that seems right amen and behind those 900 denominations amen is 900 questions amen but there's got to be one correct answer and he said I would like for us tonight amen being that we are trying to go to heaven and to meet our lord Jesus who we love amen let's search in the scriptures amen and find the correct answer amen I just want to stop here and say Amen I'm wanting to go to heaven amen I'm wanting to see Jesus I don't know about you I'm getting tired of this whole world Amen I'm getting tired of the troubles I'm getting tired of the pressures I'm getting tired of the devil I'm getting tired of the division and the confusion amen I'm ready to go home amen I'm ready to go to heaven where there is no devil where there is no sin where there is no sickness where there is no unbelief hey I want to see him amen I want to see him that died for me I want to see him that bled for me I want to see him that gave his own son amen that I might stand not in a way that seems right but in a way that I know is right hey we're trying to go to heaven amen and to meet our lord Jesus who we all love amen can I say this

you be afraid no matter how many atomic bombs they have how many hydrogen bombs how much they speak of this and this is going to happen amen don't you be scared amen because God is at the wheel he

afraid to sit down and let him be the driver because he knows ever Bend in the road he knows what's up ahead he knows what we're going to go through amen before we get there he knows it's already coming and he is going to lead us he's going to guide us hey I'm not dependent on a preacher I'm not dependent on a church I'm not dependent on some man I am dependent on Jesus who is the same yesterday today and forever hey he didn't bring us as far to leave us he didn't teach us to swim to let us drown he didn't build his home in US amen just to move away but if he saved us we got a destination and hell can't stop it the devil can't defeat it Spirits can't bind it there is a bride who's going to her destination no matter what tomorrow holds We Know Who Holds Tomorrow glory to God Amen how are we going to get to our destination by Grace hey by the grace of God we're going to reach our destination we're not going to reach it by our works we're not going to reach it by our money we're not going to reach it by our education but by the grace of [Applause] God by the grace of God we will reach our destination now I'll just say this if we have a Bible question then shouldn't we have a Bible answer well I'll say what the prophet of God said he said now notice being personally identified amen by the original headship we have the answer to the devil's question we're not looking for the answer we have the answer to the devil's question he said see he Christ is risen and has paid the price and is raising up the body the devil can't stand it that's the reason these ecumenical kingdoms are setting up that's the reason they're all coming into what they're doing now amen the devil that's the reason he's howling the way he is amen his wickedness and his scheme has been uncovered amen by the Risen resurrected Christ in the headship over his body watch a prophet and in there there would be a Time come forth where he could express amen himself in the fullness of his godhead deity amen through his church amen having preeminence in this church oh what the anointing OED man amen but now the anointed people Amen to bring back the anointed bride and bridegroom amen anointed by what come on church amen what are we anointed by are we anointed by our singing are we anointed by our music are we anointed by our Charisma are we anointed by some preacher's personality no the Bible says amen by accepting what Eve turned down our anointing amen is coming from accepting what Eve turned down he said listen coming back with the anointing of the word because he said my word is spirit amen see Anointed with the word are you ready for this what Eve turned down amen he comes back and we accept what Eve turned down he comes back and we accept he come on church amen Eve had the provisions of God she was in the Perfection of God she was in the garden of God there was no devil there was no mind battles there was no bad days good days in days out days amen she was in the Perfection of perfection amen but she got out of the provision of God but in the end time there would be a return of the anointed word that would come back in contact with the church hey and if you can accept this word you are accepting the provision of God for your life hey I love Philippians 4 he said my God shall supply all of my needs according to his riches and Glory can I say this amen I would like to have a new car but I really don't need one and then you'd like to have a bigger bank account but you really don't need one I'd like to have a bigger house but you really don't need one what you really need is a body change what you really need amen is to leave time and go into eternity come on amen amen separate your wants from your needs come on separate your wants from your needs amen we want a nicer house we want a nicer car amen but what we need amen is a place of perfection what we need is a place where there is no devil what we need is a place where there is no mind battles well may I announce to you tonight by the provision of almighty God through the grace of Jesus Christ we are back in Journey we are back on our way to the provision place that God has provided for his church what we need is a body change what we need is to see our loved ones what we need is to walk the streets of gold what we need is to sit at the married supper of the Lamb that's why Paul said that my God shall supply all your needs I love the Amplified Bible it says my God will liberally Supply my God will liberally Supply watch this he will feel until full he will feel until full come on Church in Luther's day he started feeling but it wasn't full in Wesley's day he fed some more but it wasn't full in Pentecost day he fed some more what it wasn't full hey but you are living in the hour of the fullness of the restoration of the word of God listen we ain't looking for a provision we ain't looking for a joy we ain't looking for a good service we are living in the provision of God as the Bride of Jesus Christ I'll say Christ Jesus amen is the god of our needs amen which means he knows what we need he knows what we need and he knows what we don't need according to Matthew 5 amen I love the scripture in Matthew 5 he said blessed are they which hunger and thirst for they shall be filled if God has given us that blessed promise then the only would keep us from being filled with everything that we thirst for would be because we do not believe it if we could just believe now that God will give us the very thing we're here for we'll all go home happy and satisfied tonight I'm so glad he supplies are every need he promised he would do that now he never promised that he would Supply our wants but it was our needs that he would Supply because there's many times amen that we want things that's not good for us can I say this God will supply all of our needs according to his riches and Glory can I say this and at the time we have need of it see there's times we need things and we think right now is when we need it amen but if we got it we' just hurt oursel come on y y'all remember brother talk about about Joseph as a little 5-year-old boy he said I was in there the other morning and shaven and he said now Joseph come by and he said Daddy I want the razor you know brother B looked at him he said Joseph you can't have this well come on Church Joseph was a 5-year-old boy amen it wasn't that Joseph didn't need the razor he just didn't need it at the level of maturity he was at but there would come a day that he would be a full grown man with a full beard and he would need a razor to save it come on church and God could not give the things he's give to you to the Lutheran he cannot give the things he's given to you to Wesley or even to Pentecost but there shall come an adoption according to Romans 8 amen the spirit of bondage again to fear will be broken by the restoration of the word of almighty God and there will be a full mature Holy Ghost filled amen adopted bride of Jesus Christ who will have thus sayith the Lord and she will know what to do with it she will know how to speak it she will know come on Church don't me prove it to you amen God could not give the Pentecostals what he gave the bride there had to come a maturity now now let me just say this amen I believe amen we're living in the hour where God has come on the scene to meet the need brother said where there was a trouble he said God has always been the god to meet the need where there is a need for his people amen I love this God has promised Amen to to meet the need of the hour he always does that and we need the voice of God today to meet the need of the hour to meet the time that we're living in and after all he promised it so we can rest assured that he will keep his promise that's the confidence that the believer amen has in his maker amen he has promised to meet the need amen I love this word provision the word provision is the action amen of providing or supplying something for use amen it is an amount or thing supplied or provided Amen to supply with food with drink or equipment amen especially for a journey so when there is a provision amen it's it's an action for something to use Amen to equip you to make the journey can I say this amen we are not staying in Leia we are not staying in this world we are bound and destined amen for

for the Eagles wherever the carcass is not was brother Greg is there the Eagles will be wherever the carcass is there the Eagles will be gathered together now I love Psalms 132 because David uses some very powerful words you know what he says brother he says the Lord ha chosen Zion now I'm one that studies what brother B taught and brother B said in the future home he said remember Zion is always the bride so I can read this and I can say the Lord hath chosen the bride the Lord ha chosen you because Zion is the bride now watch what he says about who he has chosen he says I will abundantly bless her provision amen I will satisfy her poor with bread what did Jesus say in the Beatitudes he said blessed are the poor in spirit for they shall see God he said blessed are they that hunger and thirst for they shall be filled hey you know what that word provision means it means food supply so when God wrote through David he said David my grace will provide a food supply for my wife in other words my wife will not be sitting at other men's tables amen trying de feed her soul but I will open up Seven Seals I will Thunder seven Thunders I will reveal the secret passages I will open up the

Andrew you're talking about a journey and there was a natural Journey for Israel right but there is a spiritual Israel don't ever forget that there's a natural Israel and there's a spiritual Israel can I say this as the Lord is meeting with natural Israel he is meeting with us can I say what Israel Israel was led in their in their Journey amen by a god-given promise brother said they were going to a promised land they were going out of a chaos into a Promised Land from the ridiculous to the sublime can I ask you one question brother Maurice what did they do before they started on their Journey they went in their tents and began to eat the lamb for their Journey come on Church what they were feeding on was either going to give them strength for their Journey or keep them in the confusion of Egypt come on church amen they were going from the ridiculous to the sublime they were going from the chaos Amen to the promised land but they wasn't going by some Voodoo they wasn't going by some Hocus Pocus trick they were going amen by feeding on the provision of Jehovah to supply the strength in their body for the journey then you know what that tells me the lamb we're feeding on is a sustaining food come on Church it don't just get you out it keeps you out it don't just shout you when you come out but 30 years later when you hear those quotes you'll still be [Applause] shouting because it's the grace of God come on church amen amen somebody asked one time they said but Andrew amen can you give me one tape that explains this message I said I can they said which is that I said 1961 the message of Grace you say how can you say that because a prophet of God stood there and says these words he says now here is the grace of God to the human race and he goes to Zechariah 4 and he says not by might and not by power amen but by my spirit sayith the Lord Brother said what is he doing it is the preparation of the rebuilding of the temple come on church do you

you God manifesting manifesting is an action manifesting his word is his [Applause] provision what was provision something supplied or provided for use so when you see the provision of God use [Applause] it come on church when you see the provision of God use it you know the Bible says amen that there's seven compound Redemptive names of Jehovah the Jehovah of the old is the Jesus of the new butam said like this he said what he appeared as God to the human race in the beginning he has to continue on under those names and under that provision if he didn't he certainly told something that was wrong when he appeared to the human race and said that's what he was and took what now now brother said look what you made God then just a man yes sir come on church if you refuse the Revelation brother said I hate to steal it so soon brother Josh but you forgive me amen Josh Bennett preached at our our Saturday morning meeting and I tell you Josh preached like a man from another planet brother Josh broke in on that on that uh that quote where brother B said they reserve the right to deny his deity at any time brother B talked about it he said see he said by tradition they subscribe to Christianity by flesh but not by Spirit he said now watch they reserve the right to deny his deity the minute you deny his deity is the minute you move into a perverted way that is undependable anything perverted is not Dependable are you hearing me anything perverted is not Dependable here a prophet of God and if the Redemptive if you if you remove him from being Jehovah you make him a man you make him a liar if oh my I'm sorry I I stopped my timer if the Redemptive names did not apply to Jesus then he isn't the Savior if all these Redemptive names was in Jesus well he's the same yesterday today and forever and so there's no way out of it they're Inseparable if Jehovah appeared as Jehovah that will provide the sacrifice he appeared as Jehovah that will heal as Jehovah our Banner as Jehovah our Shield as Jehovah our strength and Jehovah is our praise and all these different names he appeared in he has to remain that because he introduced himself Amen to the human race by those names the seven compound Redemptive names of Jehovah was God's introduction to the human race oh god brother BR said God's attitude towards the people I'm going somewhere from Eden amen back to Eden amen is in those seven Redemptive name that's exactly right take your time what Eve turned down yes sir what Eve turned down he will come back oh God Amen he will come back and we will be anointed by accepting what Eve turned down yes sir what are you saying preacher I'm saying this amen the Jehovah of the old yes sir is the Jesus of the new what do you have need of William brandom I need some squirrels then speak the word go ahead and when he spoke the word is when that Revelation broke come on Church yes sir can I say it brother Steven yes the Revelation come right back around to him oh God the revelation of the name of God and who he is come right back around but a prophet wasn't a chicken he wasn't a coward he was an eagle and when he said Jehovah of the old is the Jesus of the new he said there was a sweep of the glory of God like a rainbow Covenant come through ever was Jehovah RFA he still Jehovah Rafa if he ever was Jehovah Shai if he ever was Jehovah mku he is

was at the sacrifice the sacrificial lamb was on the grounds they were condemning and doing the very thing there that they had to do that's right he says and God be blessed for seeing this wonderful Heavenly light in this last day because the churches is doing the same thing today until the hour that organization religion is condemned and proved to be sacrificing Christ's word from then on comes
