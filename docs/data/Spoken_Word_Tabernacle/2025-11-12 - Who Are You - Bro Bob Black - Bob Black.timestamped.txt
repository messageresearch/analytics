[0:00] never doubted the promise. The Christian
[0:02] looks at the unseen. Remember, you are
[0:05] endowed with five senses. One of them is
[0:07] sight. But I'll prove to you your sight
[0:10] don't see everything. Here this morning,
[0:12] right in this room right now, there's
[0:14] living representations of creatures in
[0:18] this room. There's living voices in this
[0:20] room. If you do not, then go turn on the
[0:23] television and see if there isn't people
[0:26] plum across the nation that's being
[0:29] represented right here in this room this
[0:31] morning. There are figures and their
[0:32] beings is passing through this room. Is
[0:34] that true?
[0:35] &gt;&gt; Why? Only way you'll ever know it is a
[0:38] transmitter to pick it up and transmit
[0:40] it into reality. And the only way the
[0:42] church will ever know that Jesus Christ
[0:44] is the same yesterday and forever is get
[0:46] into that transmitter, the blood that
[0:48] transmits our sins away from us. and
[0:50] brings us across that chasm into the
[0:52] presence of God being sons of God which
[0:55] he represents himself in. Oh, what a
[0:58] great thing. If we'd look to that this
[0:59] morning, we'd forget the differences of
[1:01] the things that's in the world today and
[1:03] the things that other people are looking
[1:04] for and the great numbers and so forth.
[1:06] We're looking to Jesus Christ who is the
[1:08] author and finisher of our faith. Now
[1:11] remember, the whole Christian armor is
[1:13] supernatural. If you are a Christian,
[1:15] you say seeing is believing. You can
[1:17] never be a Christian if you believe
[1:18] that. For faith is the substance of
[1:21] things hoped for, the evidence of things
[1:22] not seen.
[1:24] &gt;&gt; You cannot be a Christian and have to
[1:26] see the thing. The whole armor of God is
[1:29] supernatural. Love, joy, peace, faith,
[1:31] longsuffering, goodness, meekness,
[1:32] channels, the Holy Ghost. It's all
[1:34] unseen. And the Christian doesn't look
[1:37] to what he sees with his eyes. He looks
[1:39] to what he sees with his faith. And his
[1:41] faith can only be based upon one thing.
[1:43] That's the word.
[1:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47] Now I feel like you're shouting back.
[1:49] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. See, when you get to that
[1:51] word, that's the living thing. That's
[1:53] the word.
[1:54] &gt;&gt; When your mind and eyes can be single to
[1:57] that word and focus that in till you see
[1:59] exactly what gods are doing. What a
[2:02] wonderful thing. Abraham saw it. See, he
[2:04] did not look to any of the
[2:06] misunderstandings
[2:08] of the promise. What if he would have
[2:10] looked and said, "Here, I'm 75 years old
[2:12] and such and such a voice spoke to me
[2:14] and said, "I'm to have a baby by my
[2:16] wife. She's 65 years old, about 15, 20
[2:20] years past menopause.

[36:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:47] &gt;&gt; God bless you church. Um
[36:50] &gt;&gt; want to give this quick testimony. Um I
[36:52] gave a brief um testimony today this
[36:55] morning on on the group chats, but um I
[36:58] just wanted to thank God for my life. Um
[37:01] this morning I was heading to work. Um I
[37:05] had, you know, my original slow gospel
[37:07] music playing. Um, and I was, um, I
[37:11] think there was, there was either slow
[37:12] traffic or we were at a red light and
[37:15] there was a car in front of me and my
[37:16] foot was on the brake, you know, just
[37:18] waiting until it the traffic was clear
[37:20] so we can um, go ahead and go through.
[37:22] And then um I just heard a big bang hit
[37:27] the back of my car and then my head wrap
[37:29] even flew out out of the um out of off
[37:32] of my head. And then um it took me a
[37:34] while to kind of understand what was
[37:36] going on. And then so since the person
[37:38] hit me from behind, it pushed me to hit
[37:40] the person that was in front of me. So
[37:41] my head was hurting very very bad. Um
[37:43] it's still kind of hurting now. Um the
[37:46] accident happened this morning around
[37:48] like 8:00 and it's 8 now and it's still
[37:51] hurting a little bit. So, um I just know
[37:53] it was the devil especially um from
[37:55] yesterday yesterday's um prayer meeting.
[37:58] I know God um in this season in my life,
[38:01] he's doing um tremendous things and I
[38:03] know just the devil trying to bring me
[38:05] down. Um I was even on time for work. I
[38:08] was actually [laughter] my goal was to
[38:10] make it um to make it to work early so I
[38:11] can just get things done so when my
[38:13] students come, you know, the day can
[38:15] just, you know, go um the way it was
[38:18] supposed to, but that ended up not
[38:19] happening. Um, but also through this um,
[38:22] trial, I know the devil hates me. I hate
[38:25] him, too. So, we hating each other, but
[38:27] um, you don't know, I hate him more, but
[38:29] um, I know, you know, it was just him
[38:31] trying to discourage me. But through
[38:33] this, um, situation that was happening.
[38:35] Um, I just thank God that he actually
[38:37] revealed that I guess around this whole
[38:39] time, I didn't know, um, when, you know,
[38:41] the police officers came and everything
[38:43] and they were getting our information.
[38:45] Um, I end up seeing that the the the
[38:47] lady who I hit, she ended up leaving.
[38:49] then the person who, you know, who was
[38:50] at fault, he ended up leaving, but I was
[38:52] the only one just sitting there and I I
[38:53] didn't really think too much of it. Um,
[38:55] so when the lady came back, she was
[38:56] like, "Hey, you know that your license
[38:58] um is actually suspended." And I was
[38:59] like, "I suspend it." I was confused on
[39:02] why my license was suspended. Um, she
[39:04] said that it was suspended since um last
[39:07] December, and it's almost December now.
[39:09] So, this whole year I've been driving my
[39:10] car with a suspended license. Um, I
[39:13] guess it was due to a car accident that
[39:15] happened in 2023. And um to make a long
[39:19] story short, I end up calling the
[39:20] calling the DMV. I called the court and
[39:22] just I gave them documents like, "Hey,
[39:24] my ticket was paid for um since 2023."
[39:27] And I guess they saw in their record cuz
[39:28] when when that situation happened um the
[39:30] officer just told me I didn't have to go
[39:32] to court. I just have to pay the ticket
[39:33] online, which I did. Um so I guess
[39:35] apparently on their system, it was an
[39:36] error that I guess I was supposed to
[39:38] show in court. So that's where the error
[39:40] was. So I I just thank God that he was
[39:41] able to expose this situation. Um, so
[39:44] when I do get my car that was that I've
[39:46] been praying for that, you know,
[39:47] everything just goes through, you know,
[39:48] smoothly with with a license that
[39:50] actually works. So I just want to thank
[39:51] God for that blessing in disguise. Amen.
[39:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. And amen. [applause]
[40:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. We claim every blessing tonight.
[40:04] Amen. Amen. Amen. Um, we're going to
[40:08] invite brother Khala. Amen. um to thank
[40:10] the Lord for the life of our sister.
[40:14] Amen. This wonderful testimony and um
[40:17] healing sister Kayla and also bring
[40:20] before the Lord Sister Lisia in prayer.
[40:23] Amen.
[40:24] &gt;&gt; Let's all stand. Amen. Let's just bow
[40:27] our heads.

[1:14:19] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Uh there was something
[1:14:22] that slipped me up on uh last Wednesday
[1:14:24] that was mentioned but I want to clarify
[1:14:27] if I can call it corrected brother uh
[1:14:30] Caleb in the scripture. I'm not the one
[1:14:32] who preach. I don't preach on Wednesday
[1:14:34] rarely. I preach on Wednesdays but Caleb
[1:14:37] came from the tribe of Judah.
[1:14:40] &gt;&gt; It's in the book of number chapter 13
[1:14:43] verse 6. I pulled the brake but I knew I
[1:14:45] have to verify to make sure everything
[1:14:47] is clear. Caleb came from the tribe of
[1:14:50] Judah. It's in number 13 verse six but
[1:14:54] in type it's in the message the pgamus
[1:14:57] church age. Brother Brandham say Joshua
[1:15:00] is the type of the end time leader and
[1:15:03] he says Caleb is representing those that
[1:15:06] stay true with Joshua. So as a top it's
[1:15:10] a gentile but in the scripture from the
[1:15:12] tribe of Judah.
[1:15:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. Which is a lion tribe. Amen.
[1:15:18] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Just want to clarify that
[1:15:20] one. He slipped me off and then the Holy
[1:15:22] Spirit touched somebody to remind me. I
[1:15:25] was not the one who preached but
[1:15:26] everything is good as a overseer. You
[1:15:29] watch those things and make sure we stay
[1:15:32] tune in and line up with the word of
[1:15:34] God. Amen. Brother Zach, what an
[1:15:36] inspiration.
[1:15:41] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[1:15:42] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:15:45] &gt;&gt; So now we got to sing this a little bit
[1:15:48] more. So the congregation picked it up
[1:15:50] and he and he get between our God is

[1:16:24] Amen. Brother Bob has been uh wonderful
[1:16:28] and he preached for us a while, but we
[1:16:30] felt led to bring him up again. So,
[1:16:32] he'll be the main speaker tonight and
[1:16:34] the Holy Spirit will move into him. I

[1:19:11] my son and I'm so proud of him and and
[1:19:13] Lily and and it's good to be here to
[1:19:17] hear his uh his his song that he wrote.
[1:19:20] and uh and and uh we've heard from them
[1:19:23] so many good things about the wonderful
[1:19:25] things that the Lord is doing for you
[1:19:27] all here
[1:19:28] &gt;&gt; and it's good to come and see for
[1:19:30] ourselves.
[1:19:31] &gt;&gt; Um so let's just tonight I want to just
[1:19:34] take a little scripture um Philippians
[1:19:36] chapter 2 verses 5 to8
[1:19:41] &gt;&gt; and u I'm I'm not too great with
[1:19:43] preliminaries and so forth so I'm just
[1:19:45] going to jump right in. And uh but we
[1:19:47] appreciate you all and I I sure I was
[1:19:49] telling your pastor that I appreciate I
[1:19:52] sure appreciate a a church and a people
[1:19:55] that love the word and are excited about
[1:19:57] it.
[1:19:58] &gt;&gt; And uh that that is so so wonderful in
[1:20:02] this hour
[1:20:03] &gt;&gt; that we're living in where so many are
[1:20:05] have become uh uh cold or apathetic to
[1:20:10] stay on fire for the word.
[1:20:13] &gt;&gt; Yes [clears throat] sir. But uh I I want
[1:20:15] to take a little topic uh tonight from
[1:20:17] this scripture. Who are you?
[1:20:19] &gt;&gt; Before we get into the word, let's just
[1:20:21] go to the author.
[1:20:22] &gt;&gt; Lord God, we're so grateful tonight for
[1:20:25] your anointing and for your presence,
[1:20:26] Lord. And surely an atmosphere of faith
[1:20:29] and believing has been set, Lord God, as
[1:20:31] all the songs have been sung. And Lord,
[1:20:34] the song was sung and I stepped forward.
[1:20:37] But Lord, I'm just your assistant
[1:20:39] tonight. And I pray God that you'll come
[1:20:42] up on the scene Lord Jesus. And help me
[1:20:44] Lord God that you Lord give utterance
[1:20:47] Lord to the things where I don't have
[1:20:48] any ability in myself to speak Lord and
[1:20:51] give hearing Lord where we're beyond our
[1:20:53] ability to understand Lord Jesus. And I
[1:20:56] pray God that you'll have liberty Lord
[1:20:58] to move among us tonight Lord Jesus.
[1:21:01] Lord we welcome your presence Lord and
[1:21:03] we surrender to your will Lord God. And
[1:21:05] we just ask that you'll move among us
[1:21:07] Lord God. And Lord, tonight Lord, surely
[1:21:10] there's there's some that are sitting
[1:21:11] here seeking direction in their life and
[1:21:14] needing different things, Lord. And we
[1:21:16] know that your word is still a discerner
[1:21:18] of the thoughts and intents of the
[1:21:19] heart, Lord. And your word can speak
[1:21:21] exactly to each and every need, Lord.
[1:21:23] And that's what we're trusting in
[1:21:25] tonight, Lord Jesus. And we ask this
[1:21:27] blessing over the words, Lord, as we
[1:21:29] read. And we pray, Lord, that you'll
[1:21:30] give us the true meaning and the true
[1:21:32] essence of these things. And make it
[1:21:34] come alive to us in our hearts and our
[1:21:36] lives so that when we leave this place,
[1:21:38] it won't be just something that we
[1:21:40] learned about, but something that has
[1:21:42] become that that has begun to change our
[1:21:45] lives and change our character. We ask
[1:21:47] in your precious name.
[1:21:50] And so, uh, in Philippians 2:5, we'll
[1:21:53] just take, uh, from 5 to 8. And it says,
[1:21:56] "Let this mind be in you
[1:22:00] &gt;&gt; which was also in Christ Jesus."
[1:22:03] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:22:05] &gt;&gt; Who being in the form of God, thought it
[1:22:08] not robbery to be equal with God.
[1:22:10] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:22:11] but made himself of no reputation,
[1:22:15] &gt;&gt; and took upon him the form of a servant,
[1:22:18] &gt;&gt; and was made in the likeness of men,
[1:22:21] &gt;&gt; and being found in fashion as a man,
[1:22:24] &gt;&gt; he humbled himself,
[1:22:26] &gt;&gt; and became obedient to death, even the
[1:22:29] death of the cross. God bless you,
[1:22:31] saints. You can take your seats.
[1:22:33] &gt;&gt; Now, the reason I think this is such an
[1:22:35] important question tonight, who are you?
[1:22:38] because it's it's important in the day
[1:22:40] and the hour that we're living to to to
[1:22:42] know to know what our position is and to
[1:22:45] be identified correctly.
[1:22:48] &gt;&gt; And you know, the Bible tells us that
[1:22:50] that a man really is thinking his
[1:22:52] thinking comes from not not not so much
[1:22:55] the head but from the heart. And as
[1:22:57] Proverbs 23:7 says, "For as a as a man
[1:23:01] thinkketh in his heart, so is he." And
[1:23:04] then I think tonight we can take from
[1:23:06] that that as we hear the word, it begins
[1:23:09] to actually change our mind, change our
[1:23:12] thinking, change something down on the
[1:23:15] inside. And actually, if we'll connect
[1:23:17] the dot tonight, Brother Brandham said
[1:23:19] that your mind, your mind is associated
[1:23:22] with your character. So as your thinking
[1:23:24] begins to change, your character begins
[1:23:27] to change, too. And you look at this
[1:23:29] scripture that is asking this question
[1:23:31] or or framing up the thought tonight
[1:23:34] that that Jesus had he was so much the
[1:23:37] expression of God, the character of God
[1:23:40] that he thought it not robbery to be
[1:23:42] equal with God. And he come down and he
[1:23:45] made himself of no reputation. So much
[1:23:47] character of Christ. So much character
[1:23:49] of God being expressed in this man until
[1:23:51] he took on himself the form of a
[1:23:54] servant. God manifesting himself in
[1:23:57] flesh. And maybe we could think about
[1:23:59] tonight, what will it be in this day
[1:24:02] when God comes down and manifests
[1:24:04] himself behind the dirt of your flesh
[1:24:07] and reveals himself to a fallen world?
[1:24:11] Oh, it it behooves us tonight to know
[1:24:13] who we are. I I want to know who I am.
[1:24:16] And the only way that I can know who I
[1:24:18] am is to look into the mirror of God's
[1:24:21] word. You you think what a nightmare it
[1:24:23] would be to not know who you are. You
[1:24:26] know, somebody could maybe come up to
[1:24:28] you and they call you something that
[1:24:30] would be incorrect or give you a label
[1:24:32] that would be incorrect or tell you
[1:24:35] something about yourself that would be
[1:24:36] false. And if you didn't know who you
[1:24:39] were, then you would go away and you'd
[1:24:40] believe that. You'd say, "Well, well,
[1:24:42] maybe they got a point. Maybe that's a
[1:24:44] good idea." And you'd go away and maybe
[1:24:47] you would you could imagine that you're
[1:24:49] something that you're really not. And it
[1:24:51] would begin to go in your mind. You
[1:24:53] begin to reason and begin to imagine
[1:24:55] things that are not really true about
[1:24:57] yourself.
[1:24:58] &gt;&gt; But a man that can identify himself,
[1:25:01] &gt;&gt; a man that knows what he really is is
[1:25:04] settled. And Christ is our example of a
[1:25:07] man that settled. So much settled in his
[1:25:09] identity until he could pack a cross on
[1:25:12] his back and go down to Galilee and and
[1:25:15] spread his arms wide and give his life
[1:25:17] and say, "Father, forgive them. They
[1:25:20] don't know what they're doing. And and
[1:25:21] so settled in his identity, he knew who
[1:25:24] he was. And brother Ram would say the
[1:25:27] same humble obedient and
[1:25:28] self-sacrificing mind that Christ
[1:25:31] exhibited from being God informed to
[1:25:34] humbly becoming a servant and accepting
[1:25:37] death on the cross. That's the same kind
[1:25:39] of a character and the same kind of a
[1:25:42] nature that a Christian is going to
[1:25:44] manifest.
[1:25:45] &gt;&gt; Oh, we could ask this morning, are you
[1:25:47] willing to be a doormat? Are you willing
[1:25:49] to be a doormat? Are you willing to s to
[1:25:52] take that cross of Christ? If Jesus
[1:25:54] said, "If any man will come after me,
[1:25:56] let him deny himself and take up his
[1:25:59] cross and follow me." For we must be
[1:26:02] identified with Christ. We've got to Oh,
[1:26:05] we've got to be so identified with
[1:26:07] Christ until that same nature, the same
[1:26:10] life, the same makeup, the same mind.
[1:26:13] Let this mind that was in Christ be in
[1:26:16] you. I want the same thinking, the same
[1:26:19] thought process until like what we're
[1:26:21] singing only believe all things are
[1:26:24] possible. That's the kind of mind that
[1:26:26] we've got to have. No matter what the
[1:26:28] obstacle is in front of me, no matter
[1:26:31] what the mountain is, I believe that God
[1:26:33] is able.
[1:26:35] &gt;&gt; We've got to be identified with Christ.
[1:26:38] You know, we could take if we could take
[1:26:40] Christ
[1:26:42] &gt;&gt; and convert him into a thing that we
[1:26:44] could read,
[1:26:46] &gt;&gt; take all of his nature
[1:26:47] &gt;&gt; and all of his characteristics and all
[1:26:50] of his makeup and all of his secrets and
[1:26:53] all of his mysteries and all of the the
[1:26:55] back part of his mind and all the things
[1:26:58] just bottle him all up and put him into
[1:27:01] something we could read. We'd have this
[1:27:02] Bible here that we preach from. We'd
[1:27:06] have this this Bible that we open up in
[1:27:08] the morning when we're drinking our
[1:27:09] coffee or whatever you do in the
[1:27:10] morning. We meditate from Christ here in
[1:27:13] letter form. And the Bible is is full of
[1:27:17] all of these Bible characters that
[1:27:19] identify this nature, the
[1:27:21] characteristics of Christ.
[1:27:23] &gt;&gt; And through the Bible, we've got all
[1:27:24] these characters that we can begin to
[1:27:26] identify oursel with where brother would
[1:27:28] say it was Jesus Christ in Noah.
[1:27:31] &gt;&gt; It was Jesus Christ in Moses. It was
[1:27:34] Jesus Christ in David.
[1:27:36] &gt;&gt; It was Jesus Christ in Joseph.
[1:27:39] &gt;&gt; It was Jesus Christ the same yesterday,
[1:27:43] today, and forever. How do I know it's
[1:27:46] the same yesterday, today, and forever?
[1:27:48] Because his nature is the same. His
[1:27:50] doings is the same. His makeup is the
[1:27:53] same. And if he manifested his life back
[1:27:55] then in a certain way, he'll manifest
[1:27:58] that same life. Today, he's still the
[1:28:00] same. And whatever you have a need of
[1:28:03] today, he's still the same God to meet
[1:28:06] that need.
[1:28:08] &gt;&gt; And brother Ram would say, I'm sure
[1:28:10] tonight that we ought to find ourselves
[1:28:13] somewhere
[1:28:14] &gt;&gt; in some character of the Bible
[1:28:17] &gt;&gt; so that we would know the outcome of
[1:28:19] that character
[1:28:21] &gt;&gt; and know what our outcome will be. O to
[1:28:24] think about that that we begin to read
[1:28:26] about these characters and
[1:28:28] &gt;&gt; and and it's it becomes more than just a
[1:28:30] story. you learn about in Sunday school
[1:28:32] or a story you learn about at the knee
[1:28:35] of your mother. It becomes something
[1:28:37] that as you read about it, you begin to
[1:28:39] see the nature of Christ reflected in
[1:28:42] these individuals. And then you begin to
[1:28:45] identify yourself with these
[1:28:46] individuals. Like maybe maybe tonight
[1:28:49] you're going through a job on the ash
[1:28:51] heap moment. You're going through a
[1:28:53] season where you're sitting on the ash
[1:28:54] heap like Job. And you begin to read in
[1:28:57] the Bible what Job endured and about how
[1:28:59] he's how how how he got to a place where
[1:29:02] he could rejoice sitting on that ash
[1:29:04] heap. And you begin to identify yourself
[1:29:07] with with maybe with Noah or Elijah or
[1:29:10] Moses or Peter or Jacob. And you find
[1:29:13] what are you what are you doing? You're
[1:29:14] identifying yourself with Christ because
[1:29:18] Christ is revealed in every character in
[1:29:20] the Bible, every page in the Bible,
[1:29:22] every story in the Bible. It's the
[1:29:24] nature of Christ being revealed.
[1:29:28] &gt;&gt; Brother Ram will tell this little story
[1:29:30] about a little boy that went over to his
[1:29:31] grandmama's house and and he had he had
[1:29:34] grown up real poor and he he didn't even
[1:29:37] hardly know what a mirror was and he
[1:29:39] went he went around. He went behind the
[1:29:41] door and he found that that mirror and
[1:29:43] he began to look at it and he saw a
[1:29:45] little boy in the mirror and and by and
[1:29:49] by he began to look and he noticed well
[1:29:51] he moves his arm that little boy in the
[1:29:52] mirror moves his arm he moves his leg
[1:29:54] that little boy in the mirror moves his
[1:29:56] leg and he began to realize wait this
[1:29:58] isn't just another little boy this is me
[1:30:02] and he turned around and he said to his
[1:30:04] mama why mama that's me well that's the
[1:30:07] story of us looking in the scripture you
[1:30:09] read and you read and you begin to
[1:30:11] wonder what what who is this and you
[1:30:14] begin to identify that that's that's
[1:30:16] talking about you that story of Joseph
[1:30:18] is you that story of Noah is you and you
[1:30:21] begin to see yourself in the scripture
[1:30:24] and I'll tell you that's where a
[1:30:25] Christian gets their identity when you
[1:30:27] begin to see your same life reflected in
[1:30:29] the Bible then you begin to say you know
[1:30:32] what I am a genuine Christian because I
[1:30:35] can see my life written between the
[1:30:37] pages of the Bible Yes, sir.
[1:30:40] &gt;&gt; Oh, you know, every one of us down on
[1:30:42] the inside, we've got that, you know,
[1:30:44] the scripture we're reading about, let
[1:30:45] this mind,
[1:30:47] &gt;&gt; something down on the inside that
[1:30:48] governs our character.
[1:30:50] &gt;&gt; Something down that soul down on the
[1:30:52] inside that governs the way that you
[1:30:53] think and the way that you react to
[1:30:55] situations than the way that you are.
[1:30:58] And you know, when you go look into a
[1:30:59] natural mirror, you see your flesh and
[1:31:01] you see the wrinkles and you see all the
[1:31:03] all the bags under I see all the bags
[1:31:05] under my eyes and all the problems of
[1:31:08] life. But you know, if you really want
[1:31:10] to see what that thing is way down in
[1:31:12] there,
[1:31:13] &gt;&gt; the only way that you can see is to look
[1:31:16] into the mirror of God's word and let
[1:31:19] the word reflect back what you really
[1:31:22] are. Oh, sometimes it reflects bad
[1:31:24] things back. all but when it begins to
[1:31:27] through the course of life through
[1:31:29] season after season things begin to drop
[1:31:31] away and you begin to see that it's
[1:31:33] becoming the nature of character of
[1:31:35] Christ reflected back then you've got
[1:31:38] your identity then then you know who you
[1:31:40] are then you know where you come from
[1:31:43] like brother said I I I'm not from
[1:31:45] Charles and Ella Brandom I know where I
[1:31:47] come from I come from I come from God
[1:31:51] &gt;&gt; and I'm going back to God
[1:31:53] &gt;&gt; and brother Bram said and that's what we
[1:31:55] want to look at tonight.
[1:31:56] &gt;&gt; And when he's preaching this sermon so
[1:31:58] many years ago that I'm basing this
[1:32:00] message off of tonight, he said, "I want
[1:32:02] to look at me
[1:32:03] &gt;&gt; and I want you to look at yourself."
[1:32:06] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:32:07] &gt;&gt; And we could frame that up tonight just
[1:32:09] like that. I want to look at me
[1:32:12] &gt;&gt; and I want you to look at yourself.
[1:32:14] That's
[1:32:14] &gt;&gt; right.
[1:32:15] &gt;&gt; He said, "I want to see myself in God's
[1:32:17] looking glass." That's it.
[1:32:19] &gt;&gt; Cuz if anything will show you where
[1:32:21] you're standing,
[1:32:22] &gt;&gt; it's this book. That's it. It's this
[1:32:25] book. There is no book like it
[1:32:28] &gt;&gt; cuz it is all truth.
[1:32:30] &gt;&gt; Now, aren't you glad tonight that we've
[1:32:32] got a book that we don't have to wonder,
[1:32:34] well, is this part true?
[1:32:35] &gt;&gt; We don't have to wonder like so many
[1:32:37] other books there are in the world. Is
[1:32:39] this is this true? Is this Everything
[1:32:42] about this book is true. Everything in
[1:32:44] this book is true. And if there's
[1:32:46] anything wrong, it's me as I'm looking
[1:32:49] in this book. There ain't nothing wrong
[1:32:50] with this book. And there ain't nothing
[1:32:52] wrong with the message. God gave us a
[1:32:54] pure, complete message. And if there's
[1:32:56] anything wrong, I've got to tally my
[1:32:58] life up with it. We're not trying to
[1:33:00] make the message tally up with us. We're
[1:33:02] trying to make our life tally up with
[1:33:04] this message. Now, aren't you glad that
[1:33:06] God give us a perfect word, a perfect
[1:33:08] message to make a perfect bride to take
[1:33:10] us in a perfect rapture. God give us
[1:33:13] everything that we have need of bottled
[1:33:15] up in this word for us.
[1:33:18] &gt;&gt; The mirror shows us ourselves.
[1:33:20] &gt;&gt; Yes, my brother. When I look into the
[1:33:21] mirror of this word, sir,
[1:33:23] &gt;&gt; it won't show me the person next to me
[1:33:26] &gt;&gt; or even maybe even the behind the pulpit
[1:33:28] &gt;&gt; or your spouse or your children.
[1:33:31] &gt;&gt; We can get so interested in
[1:33:32] understanding everybody else sometimes
[1:33:33] that we fail to understand ourselves.
[1:33:36] But when we look into the mirror of
[1:33:37] God's word, it identifies exactly what
[1:33:40] we are. Yes, my brother.
[1:33:41] &gt;&gt; And you know, you don't tonight.
[1:33:43] Somebody can label you, as we were
[1:33:44] saying. Somebody could put all these
[1:33:46] different labels on us, but you are not
[1:33:49] identified by the label that someone
[1:33:51] else gives you. And somebody could say,
[1:33:54] well, he ain't even born again. And
[1:33:56] somebody could say, well, that person's
[1:33:57] not very intelligent or or or maybe put
[1:33:59] labels on you like, well, they're
[1:34:00] Pentecostal. They're they're poor or
[1:34:02] they're intellectual or they're
[1:34:04] charismatic. But we are not identified
[1:34:06] by labels that somebody puts on us. We
[1:34:09] are identified by life and as we receive
[1:34:12] the word is changing our life to be like
[1:34:15] him. That's my identification is the
[1:34:17] life and the nature and the
[1:34:19] characteristic of Christ.
[1:34:24] &gt;&gt; Oh, we've got to understand ourselves.
[1:34:27] &gt;&gt; You know the disciples when Jesus began
[1:34:29] to break bread with them, he told them
[1:34:30] one of them was going to betray him.
[1:34:32] They wanted to know is it me? Am I am I
[1:34:34] the Judas? Is there something wrong with
[1:34:37] me? Psalm 139 says, "Search me, oh God."
[1:34:41] And David's crying out, "Search me, oh
[1:34:43] God, and know my heart. Try me and know
[1:34:45] my thoughts." Second Corinthians says,
[1:34:48] "Examine yourselves, whether you be in
[1:34:51] the faith, prove your own selves."
[1:34:53] Lamentation says, "Let us search and try
[1:34:55] our ways, and again unto the unto the
[1:34:58] Lord." And Galatians says, "For if a man
[1:35:01] think himself to be something when he is
[1:35:03] nothing, he deceiveth himself. But let
[1:35:06] every man prove his own work. And the
[1:35:08] way that we prove and the way that we
[1:35:10] examine and the way we try oursel is to
[1:35:13] look into this word and see look into
[1:35:15] the mirror of God's word. You know
[1:35:17] sometime many times when you look into
[1:35:19] the mirror of God's word you're standing
[1:35:20] there alone just like that little boy
[1:35:24] &gt;&gt; looking behind that little door
[1:35:26] &gt;&gt; and he looked in the mirror. He's
[1:35:27] standing there
[1:35:29] standing there just brother would say
[1:35:31] the walk with Christ is an individual
[1:35:33] walk. Amen.
[1:35:34] &gt;&gt; You walk. You stand alone.
[1:35:37] &gt;&gt; With you and God alone.
[1:35:39] &gt;&gt; Not you and the pastor.
[1:35:41] &gt;&gt; You and God alone.
[1:35:43] &gt;&gt; Not you and the deacon.
[1:35:45] &gt;&gt; Sometimes you and your wife, you and
[1:35:47] your husband, but you and God alone.
[1:35:50] &gt;&gt; You stand alone
[1:35:52] &gt;&gt; on your convictions.
[1:35:54] &gt;&gt; God deals with individuals.
[1:35:57] &gt;&gt; You know, sitting here tonight in this
[1:35:59] congregation, there's many of us
[1:36:00] gathered here together. But you know, as
[1:36:02] the word goes forth and and you're we're
[1:36:04] comparing ourselves with the word, God
[1:36:07] is dealing with us, each of us as
[1:36:08] individuals.
[1:36:10] &gt;&gt; There might be somebody sitting to your
[1:36:12] right and to your left, but the word is
[1:36:13] dealing with your heart, dealing with
[1:36:15] you, to expose frailties, to expose
[1:36:18] faults, to uncover weaknesses, God, and
[1:36:21] to expose whether we're genuine or
[1:36:22] whether we're true. God is dealing with
[1:36:25] individuals, you know, even to the point
[1:36:27] where he said when like a little chicken
[1:36:29] when it's hatching out of the eggshell,
[1:36:31] it's got to do it alone. You can't help
[1:36:33] it because if you help it, then it comes
[1:36:36] out and it's going to, you know, you you
[1:36:38] kill it and it it'll start relying on
[1:36:40] the person that helped it out instead of
[1:36:42] on its relationship with God. You got to
[1:36:44] hatch out of that egg alone. You got to
[1:36:46] fight your battles alone. You got to
[1:36:48] look into that mirror of God's word
[1:36:50] alone. Alone in your own alone time in
[1:36:52] the in the dead of night, staring up at
[1:36:55] that ceiling, meditating with God,
[1:36:57] crying out to God. Oh, that's where
[1:36:59] battles are fought. Alone with God,
[1:37:02] finding out who we are. Who am I, God?
[1:37:06] Examine me. Try me. See if there be any
[1:37:09] wicked way in me. See, am I the Judas?
[1:37:12] Is there something wrong with me, oh
[1:37:14] God? Examine me and try me, Lord.
[1:37:18] cuz it's necessary to know who you are.
[1:37:22] &gt;&gt; Not just who you are as a church
[1:37:24] &gt;&gt; or who who you are as a people, but who
[1:37:26] you are as an individual.
[1:37:28] &gt;&gt; And brother Brown would even say we can
[1:37:30] never rightly be able to have faith
[1:37:32] until positionally.
[1:37:34] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:37:34] &gt;&gt; We know what we are. We need to know who
[1:37:37] we are in order to have faith.
[1:37:39] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. And brother, I'm going to say
[1:37:41] Jesus gave us the example
[1:37:43] &gt;&gt; of what we ought to be looking at.
[1:37:46] &gt;&gt; When he reflected his life to us through
[1:37:49] the word,
[1:37:50] &gt;&gt; what we should see when we look into
[1:37:52] God's mirror, we should see our self
[1:37:55] identified with him. That is a perfect
[1:37:59] example. And he said as we go along
[1:38:02] through life, our character molds the
[1:38:05] image that we are. Each one knows that
[1:38:07] you as you live so is your character
[1:38:10] molds you to what you are. It's your
[1:38:13] character. Your life the word being
[1:38:16] expressed in the day and the age that
[1:38:18] we're living in.
[1:38:20] &gt;&gt; As we hear the word,
[1:38:23] &gt;&gt; you know, as you hear the word,
[1:38:26] &gt;&gt; you begin to understand why I am the way
[1:38:28] I am.
[1:38:28] &gt;&gt; That's exactly right.
[1:38:30] &gt;&gt; Why is it that I act the way that I do?
[1:38:32] &gt;&gt; That's right. Why is it that I want the
[1:38:35] way that the things that I do?
[1:38:37] &gt;&gt; Why is it that I seem such an oddball?
[1:38:43] &gt;&gt; You remember that story, brother, I'm
[1:38:44] told, of the little chicken in the
[1:38:45] barnyard.
[1:38:46] &gt;&gt; Now, you think about that story. Let's
[1:38:48] just meditate on that for a moment. That
[1:38:50] little eagle in the barnyard hatched out
[1:38:53] from under a chicken
[1:38:55] &gt;&gt; and and and for for so long, how how
[1:38:57] long did it go wondering,
[1:38:59] &gt;&gt; is there something wrong with me? Amen.
[1:39:02] &gt;&gt; And that eagle that eagle going around
[1:39:04] in the barnyard
[1:39:06] &gt;&gt; and wondering looking at all the other
[1:39:08] all the chickens pecking around in the
[1:39:11] dirt looking for worms and things and
[1:39:13] they said and it maybe try try to fit
[1:39:16] in. Go peck peck in the dirt and it's
[1:39:19] like okay I'm trying to make it work but
[1:39:22] something ain't right.
[1:39:25] Something ain't right.
[1:39:27] And and listen, you know that old Balum
[1:39:29] doctrine says there ain't no difference
[1:39:32] between a chicken and an eagle. But I'm
[1:39:34] here to tell you tonight that there is a
[1:39:36] difference between a chicken and an
[1:39:39] eagle. Now what reveals the difference
[1:39:42] is when mama eagle began to scream. Then
[1:39:45] it looked up and it said, "Now I begin
[1:39:47] to realize I ain't like this chicken in
[1:39:50] the barnyard. These chickens in the
[1:39:52] barnyard going down, pecking, pecking
[1:39:54] one another, pecking on the shores of
[1:39:56] one another, trying to beat each other
[1:39:58] up. But there's that mama eagle's
[1:40:00] calling me up, calling me higher,
[1:40:03] calling me to rise. Oh, it tried to it's
[1:40:05] trying to get up, flop up on the on the
[1:40:07] fence post, trying to get figure out how
[1:40:09] to spread them wings because it knew
[1:40:12] that, oh, church, you are not a chicken,
[1:40:15] you're an eagle. And when you begin to
[1:40:18] identify yourself by the word, you
[1:40:19] realize what you are and who you are.
[1:40:25] &gt;&gt; There's a lesson to be had here. That
[1:40:26] chicken in the barnyard, the
[1:40:28] counterfeit, will always try to make the
[1:40:31] genuine think that there's something
[1:40:34] wrong with them.
[1:40:36] &gt;&gt; But what's wrong?
[1:40:41] &gt;&gt; The counterfeit will always try to make
[1:40:43] the real look fake or the fake look
[1:40:45] real. It'll always try to flip the
[1:40:47] thing, but the real is identified by the
[1:40:50] word.
[1:40:51] &gt;&gt; The real is identified by the life.
[1:40:54] &gt;&gt; And I'll tell you, I'll tell you
[1:40:56] tonight, those those that chle and the
[1:40:58] eagle, they're both birds.
[1:41:01] &gt;&gt; They They both got They both got beaks.
[1:41:03] They both got feathers.
[1:41:05] &gt;&gt; They both look very similar.
[1:41:07] &gt;&gt; I'll say it like this. Brother Random
[1:41:09] when he was going to preach the seals,
[1:41:11] he said he was about to come out and he
[1:41:13] he was about to say that that that white
[1:41:15] horse rider was the Holy Ghost
[1:41:18] &gt;&gt; like he had preached before in the
[1:41:20] mighty conqueror.
[1:41:21] &gt;&gt; But then God come on the scene.
[1:41:24] &gt;&gt; And showed him what it really was. And
[1:41:26] then he could tell the difference. He
[1:41:29] could tell the difference between a
[1:41:30] bluff that got that that bow with no
[1:41:32] air. He could tell the difference
[1:41:34] between something something real and
[1:41:35] genuine that lying anointing. he could
[1:41:37] tell the difference. And sometimes it
[1:41:39] takes us a long time for us to be able
[1:41:42] to tell the difference. But God wants us
[1:41:44] in this day and hour that we're living
[1:41:46] in to be able to tell the difference so
[1:41:48] that you know what you are. You've got
[1:41:50] to know that you're genuine. You got to
[1:41:52] know that you ain't a faker. You got to
[1:41:54] know that you're identified in the word.
[1:41:58] [screaming]
[1:41:59] Well, that Balum Balam sitting up there
[1:42:02] saying, "Well, there ain't no difference
[1:42:03] between what we're doing over and Boab
[1:42:05] and there ain't no difference between
[1:42:07] them down in and Israel." But there was
[1:42:09] a difference because they had a a water
[1:42:11] coming from a smitten rock. They were
[1:42:13] following the pillar of fire. They had
[1:42:15] the shout of the king in the camp. In
[1:42:17] other words, they had life. There was
[1:42:19] life down in there. They had an
[1:42:21] anointing among them. God was moving in
[1:42:23] their midst. And there is a difference.
[1:42:28] Our identity comes, your identity comes
[1:42:30] from the word
[1:42:31] &gt;&gt; to be a genuine eagle,
[1:42:34] &gt;&gt; a genuine dove,
[1:42:35] &gt;&gt; a genuine lamb.
[1:42:37] &gt;&gt; You know, there's a difference between a
[1:42:39] lamb and a goat.
[1:42:41] &gt;&gt; There's a difference between a vulture
[1:42:42] and an eagle.
[1:42:44] &gt;&gt; There's a difference between a dove and
[1:42:46] a crow. But a crow looks like it's a
[1:42:50] bird and it's got a beak and it's got
[1:42:53] feathers and it's got all those things,
[1:42:55] but it ain't a dove
[1:42:57] &gt;&gt; and it can't act like a dove. Well, show
[1:42:59] me, brother Bob, what I need to do to
[1:43:01] act like a dove.
[1:43:02] &gt;&gt; Oh, you got to be born.
[1:43:04] &gt;&gt; You got to have your nature changed.
[1:43:07] &gt;&gt; Oh, you could be like a crow trying to
[1:43:09] put them peacock feathers in and trying
[1:43:11] to Well, well, the the scripture says
[1:43:13] that I got to have kindness. The
[1:43:15] scripture says that I got to do all
[1:43:16] these things. I'm going just I'm going
[1:43:18] to just put this peacock feather in and
[1:43:20] then nobody will know. But if it ain't
[1:43:22] coming from the inside, let this mind
[1:43:24] that was in Christ be in you. Oh, let
[1:43:28] God, let the word transform your life,
[1:43:31] transform your character, transform your
[1:43:33] nature. And then it doesn't have to be a
[1:43:35] put on. Oh, then it's not coming from
[1:43:37] some kind of a flesh workup, but it's
[1:43:39] coming from the inside, from the with
[1:43:41] inside.
[1:43:45] Oh, let the word transform us.
[1:43:48] &gt;&gt; You know, that's where even complexes
[1:43:50] come from from mis misplaced identity.
[1:43:53] &gt;&gt; Something down on the inside is wrong
[1:43:56] and we'll try to hide it. We'll try to
[1:43:58] put up that front. We'll take on a false
[1:44:00] identity to hide our inadequacies. We'll
[1:44:03] we'll put on that false identity to hide
[1:44:05] our pride. Well, I got this. I can
[1:44:07] handle it. I know better. And we'll put
[1:44:09] that false front up. that because we've
[1:44:11] got we've got a fa we're trying to adopt
[1:44:13] a false identity. But an eagle, a real
[1:44:16] eagle, don't have to put on some kind of
[1:44:18] a false face because it knows that it's
[1:44:21] got the strength of the old and the new
[1:44:22] testament that all it has to do is
[1:44:24] spread those wings and it's got
[1:44:27] something genuine to lift it up in the
[1:44:29] heights of glory, lift it up into the
[1:44:31] heights of revelation, into the
[1:44:32] mysteries. It's got something real and
[1:44:35] something genuine. And you know, even
[1:44:37] your identity is connected to your
[1:44:39] inheritance.
[1:44:41] &gt;&gt; You know, like Paul said in Galatians
[1:44:43] that if you're a servant, you're not you
[1:44:46] don't have the same relationship that a
[1:44:48] son does.
[1:44:49] &gt;&gt; So when a servant messes up, he's not
[1:44:52] going to get paid. But when a son messes
[1:44:54] up, he knows that he's still connected
[1:44:57] to his inheritance by blood, by life
[1:45:00] because he's born of his father. He's
[1:45:03] got a relationship. Oh, it all comes
[1:45:05] back to who is your daddy.
[1:45:08] &gt;&gt; Like Paul said, we are sons, not
[1:45:10] servants.
[1:45:15] &gt;&gt; Oh, if you're a son, if you're a son,
[1:45:17] you know where you're you get your
[1:45:19] identity from
[1:45:21] &gt;&gt; you know, you can even open up these
[1:45:23] pages of the Bible and take a a DNA test
[1:45:27] &gt;&gt; to find out who your daddy is.
[1:45:30] When we open up the pages of this Bible
[1:45:32] and we we see that we're our nature and
[1:45:35] our character is identified with these
[1:45:38] people that we're reading about,
[1:45:40] &gt;&gt; then we know where we come from.
[1:45:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:45] &gt;&gt; Our identity is in the word.
[1:45:47] &gt;&gt; Yes, my brother.
[1:45:49] &gt;&gt; You know, if you're a son too, any child
[1:45:51] of God can claim any benefit. God don't
[1:45:53] play favorites. You
[1:45:57] you you'll
[1:45:59] watch sometimes how we raise our
[1:46:00] children in the natural. Well, people
[1:46:02] will take a little fa they'll take a son
[1:46:04] or a daughter and they'll treat them
[1:46:05] like the favorite and they'll reward
[1:46:07] them maybe better than all the other
[1:46:09] ones. But God doesn't do that.
[1:46:13] If you're a son, if you're a son of God,
[1:46:16] any child of God can claim
[1:46:23] able to give it to you tonight. If you
[1:46:26] need a healed body, if you need your
[1:46:29] faith restored, if you need more Holy
[1:46:31] Ghost power in your life, if you're a
[1:46:33] son of God, you can take that token and
[1:46:35] hold it over your request and hold hold
[1:46:37] it over God's promise and believe that
[1:46:39] God will give it to you. Like Paul said,
[1:46:41] come boldly to the throne of grace.
[1:46:45] &gt;&gt; Our identity is in the word.
[1:46:50] &gt;&gt; Many times the devil can influence how
[1:46:52] people look at you until you get so down
[1:46:54] by what somebody else thinks or feels
[1:46:56] about you.
[1:46:58] &gt;&gt; And if you listen to that, you can get
[1:46:59] so discouraged by what somebody else
[1:47:01] thinks or says about you.
[1:47:04] But as a believer, you got to know who
[1:47:06] you are
[1:47:08] &gt;&gt; until if somebody put tries to put that
[1:47:10] label on you that's false
[1:47:13] &gt;&gt; and just let it roll off of you like
[1:47:14] water off a duck's back.
[1:47:19] &gt;&gt; Don't let the devil identify you
[1:47:21] tonight.
[1:47:24] &gt;&gt; We've got to know it's right. We've got
[1:47:26] to know the message is right. We've got
[1:47:27] to know we're right. We've got to know
[1:47:30] who we are until we can say, "I know
[1:47:32] when I got the Holy Ghost."
[1:47:34] &gt;&gt; I know where I was when I got it.
[1:47:37] &gt;&gt; I know the effect it had on my life.
[1:47:42] &gt;&gt; Like Jesus said, "At that day, you shall
[1:47:44] know that I am in my father and ye in me
[1:47:46] and I in you." We've got to know.
[1:47:50] &gt;&gt; And the word identifies itself by its
[1:47:52] nature.
[1:47:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:54] &gt;&gt; By its characteristics.
[1:47:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Brother said, "We also
[1:47:59] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:48:00] &gt;&gt; the Christian church itself,
[1:48:02] &gt;&gt; which is of no denomination,
[1:48:05] &gt;&gt; but of a nature."
[1:48:06] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:48:07] &gt;&gt; And now, aren't you glad tonight that
[1:48:09] there's a nature of Christ that he can
[1:48:10] manifest in you?
[1:48:12] &gt;&gt; That's why the Holy Ghost is not a
[1:48:14] doctrine or a theology,
[1:48:16] &gt;&gt; but it's the person of Jesus Christ.
[1:48:19] &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today,
[1:48:22] and forever of the same nature. And you
[1:48:25] know, you can go all around the world.
[1:48:27] You can go down in Nicaragua, over in
[1:48:29] Africa. You can go to the Middle East,
[1:48:32] wherever there are Christian, born again
[1:48:34] believers, and you can find brothers and
[1:48:37] sisters all around the world with that
[1:48:40] same nature. And that same nature will
[1:48:43] make a woman begin to clothe herself.
[1:48:46] That same nature will make a man begin
[1:48:48] to act like a real man because it's the
[1:48:52] same Jesus, the same yesterday, today,
[1:48:55] and forever. Brother said, "When you're
[1:48:58] a Christian, your nature as a Christian,
[1:49:00] and you don't have to say you can't
[1:49:02] smoke, their nature is different. The
[1:49:05] spirit of Christ is in the person and
[1:49:07] Christ don't do those things." Uh-huh.
[1:49:12] &gt;&gt; He said, "Why do you want to be a
[1:49:14] miserable, decrepit, ungodly crowor when
[1:49:16] you could be a dove?" Certainly,
[1:49:18] &gt;&gt; you just have to have your nature
[1:49:20] changed
[1:49:21] &gt;&gt; and you change your nature.
[1:49:23] &gt;&gt; Become a son and daughter of God. Be at
[1:49:26] peace with God. God has to change your
[1:49:30] nature before you can even seek after
[1:49:32] him. He said, "Because you're a sinner.
[1:49:34] You're a pig." Oh, it's God doing. It's
[1:49:36] God calling us. God drawing us. God
[1:49:39] drawing us like a magnet to himself. His
[1:49:42] word wooing over us. His spirit moving
[1:49:44] and calling and drawing. It's his spirit
[1:49:47] to move us. That's why it's not just
[1:49:49] doctrines and theology. It's the person
[1:49:51] moving and and doing in us
[1:49:54] &gt;&gt; like a living blazing consuming fire.
[1:49:58] &gt;&gt; You know, we we go camping sometimes and
[1:50:00] we'll pile up sticks around the campfire
[1:50:02] and and and that's you know, that's like
[1:50:04] the mechanics. You you can pile up
[1:50:06] sticks on the on the campfire and and
[1:50:08] and and you've got all the mechanics
[1:50:10] there.
[1:50:11] &gt;&gt; Oh, but then you light a match
[1:50:13] &gt;&gt; and the mechanics become the dynamics
[1:50:16] &gt;&gt; and it begins to come something that
[1:50:18] that you can sit around and get warmth
[1:50:20] by. It takes fire, revelation by the
[1:50:23] spirit to produce this nature. It takes
[1:50:25] the living moving spirit of the living
[1:50:28] God to transform his word into something
[1:50:30] that's alive to take it off the page and
[1:50:33] make it living. walking in your walking
[1:50:36] in your two feet, move using your two
[1:50:38] hands, using your eyes to fulfill his
[1:50:41] word.
[1:50:42] &gt;&gt; To transform it from a mental faith to
[1:50:44] something real,
[1:50:47] &gt;&gt; brother say the biggest part of our
[1:50:49] faith is mental faith.
[1:50:50] &gt;&gt; By hearing the word, it brings us to a
[1:50:52] mental recognition of God. That's right.
[1:50:54] &gt;&gt; But if this coming from above, oh
[1:50:57] brother, if it ever strikes this, there
[1:50:59] is a godly spiritual faith, then what
[1:51:02] does that faith do? That faith
[1:51:04] recognizes only the word. And when the
[1:51:07] word itself is pouring into our faith,
[1:51:10] our mental faith becomes a spiritual
[1:51:13] revelation.
[1:51:15] &gt;&gt; That's what Paul was speaking of in
[1:51:16] Romans chapter 12 when he said, "Be not
[1:51:18] conformed to this world, but be ye
[1:51:21] transformed by the renewing of your
[1:51:23] mind." And what he's speaking of when he
[1:51:25] said, "Let this mind that was in Christ
[1:51:28] be in you." you. So then we can see that
[1:51:30] the conclusion of the matter is not
[1:51:32] mental faith.
[1:51:33] &gt;&gt; The conclusion is a supernatural
[1:51:35] transformative experience with deity
[1:51:38] that transforms and changes our our
[1:51:41] lives.
[1:51:44] &gt;&gt; You know, if we examine this out, mental
[1:51:45] faith is limited and frail and weak.
[1:51:48] &gt;&gt; But a spiritual faith will move
[1:51:50] mountains.
[1:51:53] &gt;&gt; No matter what the obstacle is,
[1:51:55] spiritual faith will move it. And all
[1:51:58] things are possible to them that have a
[1:51:59] spiritual revelation, to them that has
[1:52:02] had their mind changed, to them that has
[1:52:05] had their soul changed.
[1:52:08] &gt;&gt; You know, there's times when you you
[1:52:10] hear things and they are the words of
[1:52:11] God, but they've been put together
[1:52:12] intellectually.
[1:52:15] &gt;&gt; And if you put it together
[1:52:16] intellectually, it will lead you to an
[1:52:17] intellectual conclusion.
[1:52:20] &gt;&gt; And intellectual conclusions introduce
[1:52:22] human nature. And part of human nature
[1:52:25] is there's weaknesses which also has
[1:52:27] fear.
[1:52:28] &gt;&gt; And the moment we start depending on our
[1:52:30] own ability. Now you've got the element
[1:52:32] of fear.
[1:52:34] &gt;&gt; And the element of fear is the thing
[1:52:35] needed if somebody's going to control
[1:52:37] your life.
[1:52:39] &gt;&gt; And there's that characteristic of
[1:52:40] nickelatanism that's worked down through
[1:52:42] the church ages that wants to detail
[1:52:45] every element of your life so that that
[1:52:48] spirit's got you doing what they want
[1:52:49] and how they want and when they won't.
[1:52:52] But God in this age has not given us the
[1:52:54] spirit of fear. But he's given us the
[1:52:56] spirit of power and of love and of sound
[1:52:59] mind. Revelation by the spirit is what
[1:53:01] will transform us and take us in the
[1:53:04] rapture. And Paul said in second
[1:53:06] Corinthians, "Where the spirit of the
[1:53:07] Lord is, there is liberty."
[1:53:09] &gt;&gt; Liberty. Where God Oh, God comes in with
[1:53:13] a consuming fire
[1:53:15] &gt;&gt; and makes it live.
[1:53:18] &gt;&gt; And fire creates an atmosphere.
[1:53:19] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:53:21] cuz there's a nature at work.
[1:53:23] &gt;&gt; Oh, brother said, "Look at the character
[1:53:25] of Christ."
[1:53:26] &gt;&gt; When he seen that his creation had
[1:53:28] fallen, now his own loving character
[1:53:30] molded himself into the person of
[1:53:32] Christ.
[1:53:33] &gt;&gt; God's own character of love projected
[1:53:35] himself in the man Christ.
[1:53:38] &gt;&gt; His own character molded that kind of a
[1:53:40] person. Oh, no one could ever do that
[1:53:43] but God. Amen.
[1:53:44] &gt;&gt; Oh, think about God coming down and
[1:53:47] forming a little putting a little baby
[1:53:48] in a manger and putting his own life
[1:53:50] into that child and forming his life and
[1:53:53] forming him so that he's actually the
[1:53:55] manifestation of the fullness of godhead
[1:53:58] bodily. And he said that's what he was.
[1:54:00] That's who he was and that's why he was
[1:54:02] to save you. He become you that you
[1:54:04] might become him. He took your load of
[1:54:08] sin so that we could take on that same
[1:54:10] nature and the same the
[1:54:13] Oh, he said, "You study that character a
[1:54:15] little bit and then look at yourself and
[1:54:17] I look at myself."
[1:54:21] &gt;&gt; Jesus was strange, an oddball
[1:54:24] &gt;&gt; going around a very odd character. He
[1:54:26] said, "Another wild man, another holy
[1:54:28] roller of some religious crank." And he
[1:54:30] said, "Anybody that's living right is an
[1:54:32] oddball to this modern world."
[1:54:34] &gt;&gt; And there's plenty of oddballs that are
[1:54:36] listed out in scripture. Paul said,
[1:54:38] "Fools for Christ's sakes, peculiar
[1:54:41] people, strangers and pilgrims like
[1:54:43] Abraham, strange and oddballs." Why?
[1:54:46] Because anybody is odd that tries to
[1:54:49] live by the word. Anybody is odd that's
[1:54:51] been born again and separated from this
[1:54:53] worldly system. It's odd not to listen
[1:54:56] to worldly music.
[1:54:57] &gt;&gt; It's odd to want to listen to a sermon
[1:54:59] on your lunch break.
[1:55:02] &gt;&gt; It's odd to take your Bible and sit
[1:55:03] under a tree on your lunch break.
[1:55:07] And it's odd in this day that we're
[1:55:09] living in for a sister to want to be a
[1:55:11] little mama.
[1:55:12] &gt;&gt; It's odd for a sister to want to raise a
[1:55:15] family.
[1:55:16] &gt;&gt; It's odd to raise your children by the
[1:55:18] Bible instead of psychology.
[1:55:21] &gt;&gt; It's odd to align yourself with what
[1:55:23] with what the word says we should be.
[1:55:27] &gt;&gt; I want my nature and my character to
[1:55:29] match the word and not the world.
[1:55:33] &gt;&gt; And brother was saying Christ is the
[1:55:35] mystery of God revealed. He said, "Oh,
[1:55:36] if the church only knew its position,
[1:55:40] &gt;&gt; and he said it will one day."
[1:55:41] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:55:42] &gt;&gt; Then the rapture will go when it knows
[1:55:44] what it is.
[1:55:49] &gt;&gt; Oh, if you know you're an eagle,
[1:55:52] &gt;&gt; you begin to recognize that falling and
[1:55:54] making mistakes
[1:55:56] &gt;&gt; doesn't change what you are.
[1:56:00] &gt;&gt; If you're an eagle,
[1:56:02] &gt;&gt; you trip and fall, you're still an
[1:56:03] eagle.
[1:56:05] You know, an eagle an eagle could get so
[1:56:07] low
[1:56:09] &gt;&gt; until you wonder
[1:56:11] &gt;&gt; if that eagle could even fly.
[1:56:14] &gt;&gt; You're you're an eagle when you got when
[1:56:16] you got crushed around your eyes.
[1:56:20] &gt;&gt; You're still an eagle when you got that
[1:56:21] crushed around your eyes.
[1:56:24] &gt;&gt; You're still an eagle when you feel all
[1:56:26] alone.
[1:56:28] &gt;&gt; That don't change your identity. When
[1:56:29] you're all alone and it seems like you
[1:56:32] ain't got a friend in the world.
[1:56:36] You're an eagle and nobody at work wants
[1:56:38] to associate with you. And maybe nobody
[1:56:41] at church wants to be your friend.
[1:56:42] You're still an eagle. That don't change
[1:56:45] who you are.
[1:56:47] &gt;&gt; You're an eagle in the middle of a dry
[1:56:49] spell. [cheering] Oh, you might be going
[1:56:51] through the worst dry spell you ever
[1:56:53] gone through, but you're still an eagle.
[1:56:57] When you fall, you're still an eagle.
[1:56:59] When you trip, you're still an eagle.
[1:57:01] When you make a mistake, you're still an
[1:57:03] angel. Why? Cuz you're still Oh, it's
[1:57:06] the nature on the inside.
[1:57:09] And when you rise, you're an eagle.
[1:57:14] &gt;&gt; What makes you an eagle is you have the
[1:57:17] nature and character of an eagle. It's
[1:57:19] the life that makes you what you are.
[1:57:22] It's the life that makes the difference.
[1:57:25] I am who I am because of what God made
[1:57:28] me. Not because of a peacock feather I'm
[1:57:30] trying to put in. Not by something I'm
[1:57:32] trying to put on, but by the nature that
[1:57:35] God has given to us.
[1:57:39] &gt;&gt; Uh-oh. When we begin to realize who we
[1:57:41] are, brother said that like that little
[1:57:44] an ambassador of a nation
[1:57:46] &gt;&gt; is so confident of who he is
[1:57:49] &gt;&gt; and who he represents. Then when he goes
[1:57:51] to another nation, he knows that he's
[1:57:53] got all the power and authority of that
[1:57:57] government behind him
[1:57:58] &gt;&gt; and he comes in maybe sitting to ac
[1:58:01] across from great dictators and great
[1:58:03] great men of the world, but it's not his
[1:58:06] authority that he's depending on. It's
[1:58:09] the power of the government that he's
[1:58:11] representing. Oh, and when a Christian
[1:58:13] comes and recognizes who they are and
[1:58:16] where they come from, that it's not by
[1:58:19] their own effort or not by their own
[1:58:21] will or not by their own power.
[1:58:24] It's not by power or not by might the
[1:58:27] word of the Lord to Zerubable was but
[1:58:29] grace. Grace to the headstone. And if
[1:58:32] you stay it out, what grace is is when
[1:58:34] God comes on the scene and does what you
[1:58:37] cannot.
[1:58:39] Oh, how could the children of Israel
[1:58:41] part the Red Sea?
[1:58:43] How could Abraham give him a baby in his
[1:58:45] old give himself a baby in his old age?
[1:58:48] Oh, but God's grace came on the scene
[1:58:50] and did it through his power.
[1:58:52] &gt;&gt; And we're not depending on our own self
[1:58:54] or on our own works or on our own our
[1:58:56] own abilities, but we're depending on
[1:58:58] what God did for us.
[1:59:04] &gt;&gt; Oh, brother Ram talking about Jesus. She
[1:59:06] said, "Man can't be that in himself.
[1:59:09] There's no way to educate it to it.
[1:59:12] &gt;&gt; There's no way to join it.
[1:59:14] &gt;&gt; There's no way to baptize it.
[1:59:17] &gt;&gt; There's no way of doing nothing to it."
[1:59:19] &gt;&gt; He said, "Only kill it. If we can die to
[1:59:22] oursel,
[1:59:23] &gt;&gt; if we can surrender to oursel, if we can
[1:59:26] lay all those complexes and all those
[1:59:28] pride, that pride and all all of our
[1:59:31] self, all of our self-will and say,
[1:59:33] "Lord, take me as I am." and make me as
[1:59:36] you are.
[1:59:39] &gt;&gt; He said, "Let it be born again
[1:59:41] &gt;&gt; and a new nature come in."
[1:59:43] &gt;&gt; That's the only way. Heal that nature of
[1:59:46] yourself that you might become
[1:59:48] &gt;&gt; and then the word becomes a living
[1:59:50] thing, it just expresses itself through
[1:59:53] you. Oh, if we can get in the atmosphere
[1:59:56] of surrender.
[1:59:57] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:59:57] &gt;&gt; And get in the atmosphere of dying out.
[2:00:00] Get in the atmosphere to where we
[2:00:02] realize that we can't do it oursself.
[2:00:04] Maybe you've got a problem where you
[2:00:06] just can't stay off of those websites on
[2:00:08] the internet. Maybe you got a problem
[2:00:10] where you're sneaking behind the
[2:00:11] building and you're you're taking a puff
[2:00:13] of cigarettes or something or you're
[2:00:15] you're trying to get rid of things and
[2:00:16] and you come to the end of your rope and
[2:00:18] you realize you can't do it. Well, maybe
[2:00:21] it's time to turn it over to God and
[2:00:23] surrender it and say, "Well, God, I
[2:00:25] can't do it, but I know somebody that
[2:00:27] can. I know the one that made the
[2:00:30] promise like brother said and looking to
[2:00:32] the unseen
[2:00:34] God began to speak through he him and he
[2:00:37] said I'm the one that give the promise
[2:00:39] I'm the one that raised up Christ from
[2:00:41] the grave and that same one that raised
[2:00:44] up Christ from the grave is the same one
[2:00:46] that can take all of your problems and
[2:00:48] all of your complexes and all of your
[2:00:50] addictions and all of your all of your
[2:00:53] things if we'll just surrender them to
[2:00:56] him.
[2:00:58] If we can just die out,
[2:01:02] &gt;&gt; you know Jesus when he heard Lazarus was
[2:01:05] dying, he just kept walking.
[2:01:09] &gt;&gt; He waited
[2:01:10] &gt;&gt; until he was good and dead
[2:01:12] &gt;&gt; and then
[2:01:14] &gt;&gt; he could turn around
[2:01:16] &gt;&gt; and do something.
[2:01:17] &gt;&gt; And that's how it is with us sometimes.
[2:01:20] We got to be good and dead. Climb up on
[2:01:23] that altar like brother said Abel did
[2:01:25] and say God I want to die with my
[2:01:27] sacrifice. I want to be so identified
[2:01:29] with my sacrifice until you can come and
[2:01:31] do something with me.
[2:01:33] &gt;&gt; And then Lazarus come forth out of that
[2:01:34] grave and he become a living testimony.
[2:01:37] Everywhere he went was a testimony of
[2:01:39] the resurrection power of Jesus Christ.
[2:01:42] Oh, people won't read the Bible. So God
[2:01:44] has made you a Bible like Lazarus was a
[2:01:47] living walking testament and they'll
[2:01:49] make you a living Lazarus. I once was
[2:01:52] dead but now I live once like Paul said
[2:01:55] I was doing dead works. I was coming to
[2:01:57] church and I was paying my tithe and
[2:01:59] doing things like a servant but then God
[2:02:02] come and he changed me from a servant to
[2:02:04] a son and now I'm part of his family.
[2:02:09] &gt;&gt; Oh think brother said now church think
[2:02:11] of this just a minute. We are invited to
[2:02:14] shape our own character
[2:02:17] &gt;&gt; to his by his grace.
[2:02:20] &gt;&gt; And we don't have to do anything.
[2:02:24] &gt;&gt; All we got to do is let him.
[2:02:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:27] &gt;&gt; Let
[2:02:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:29] &gt;&gt; Just let this mind
[2:02:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:31] &gt;&gt; be in you which was also in in Christ
[2:02:34] Jesus.
[2:02:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:35] &gt;&gt; He said when we let his character be in
[2:02:37] us, then we have become sons by having
[2:02:40] the mind of Christ. mind which is his
[2:02:42] character.
[2:02:43] &gt;&gt; Your mind makes your character. Let that
[2:02:46] mind of Christ be in you. It molds the
[2:02:49] character of a son of God.
[2:02:51] &gt;&gt; What was his mind to do? The mind that
[2:02:53] was in Christ always to stay with the
[2:02:56] father's word. Oh, the there's the
[2:02:58] character of a son of God.
[2:03:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:02] &gt;&gt; It's the word or die.
[2:03:05] &gt;&gt; I'm going to line up with the word.
[2:03:07] Amen.
[2:03:08] &gt;&gt; If there's something wrong, it ain't
[2:03:10] this message.
[2:03:11] &gt;&gt; If there's something wrong, it ain't the
[2:03:12] Bible.
[2:03:13] &gt;&gt; I'm going to line up with this word. If
[2:03:15] there's something I don't understand, I
[2:03:17] I'm going to do everything I can to to
[2:03:20] line up with it until I do understand
[2:03:22] it.
[2:03:23] &gt;&gt; Oh, we don't throw quotes and scripture
[2:03:25] in the garbage. But we try to line up
[2:03:28] with it because that's the nature of a
[2:03:30] son or daughter of God. always to stay
[2:03:33] with the father's word. No matter what
[2:03:35] looked glossy and what looked this way,
[2:03:38] it didn't make any difference to him.
[2:03:40] The father's word is what counted.
[2:03:42] Everywhere when he met the devil, he
[2:03:44] never even used his power to defeat him.
[2:03:46] He used the word because that was him.
[2:03:49] Oh, the word that we hear is changing
[2:03:51] our mind. The word that we hear is
[2:03:53] transforming our character. The word is
[2:03:55] making us to be just like Jesus who
[2:03:59] thought it not robbery to be equal with
[2:04:01] God. And now that same God is
[2:04:04] manifesting that same life in flesh.
[2:04:06] He's making us, transforming us until
[2:04:08] we're the living image of Christ.
[2:04:11] &gt;&gt; The masterpiece image.
[2:04:13] &gt;&gt; That's what God wants you to be. Brother
[2:04:15] Ram said, images of him.
[2:04:18] &gt;&gt; I believe that God is bringing us beyond
[2:04:21] identification based just on what
[2:04:22] somebody's saying you are.
[2:04:24] You know, somebody could preach a
[2:04:26] message where they say, "You're an
[2:04:27] eagle. You're an eagle." And you might
[2:04:28] be a crow.
[2:04:33] &gt;&gt; You're an eagle. You're an eagle. And
[2:04:35] then you go out behind the barn and
[2:04:37] smoke a cigarette or something.
[2:04:40] Oh, but when that life begins to
[2:04:42] identify
[2:04:44] that this is the eagle life, it's the
[2:04:46] life, the nature, the character of the
[2:04:48] manifested word that identifies you.
[2:04:52] &gt;&gt; And our identification begins to show us
[2:04:54] why we act the way and why we desire the
[2:04:58] things that we do.
[2:04:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:00] &gt;&gt; Scriptural identification is how we can
[2:05:02] identify the modern Jacob and Esau.
[2:05:04] &gt;&gt; Got you.
[2:05:05] &gt;&gt; How we can identify the modern Cain and
[2:05:07] Abel.
[2:05:08] &gt;&gt; That's right. How we can identify the
[2:05:10] modern Balum and Moses, right?
[2:05:12] &gt;&gt; How we can identify the modern Jesus,
[2:05:14] Judas and Christ
[2:05:18] &gt;&gt; when we know who we were, who we are.
[2:05:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:21] &gt;&gt; You look in the scripture and John, the
[2:05:23] messenger of their day, he knew who he
[2:05:24] was and what his role was.
[2:05:27] &gt;&gt; He wasn't coming all haphazard. Well, I
[2:05:28] wonder what I'm supposed to do. [sighs]
[2:05:32] &gt;&gt; He said, "This is he of whom I said,
[2:05:35] &gt;&gt; after me cometh a man who is preferred
[2:05:37] before me,
[2:05:37] &gt;&gt; right? for he was before me.
[2:05:41] &gt;&gt; He said, "And I knew him not, but that
[2:05:42] he should be man made manifest to
[2:05:44] Israel. Therefore am I come baptizing
[2:05:48] with water." That's right.
[2:05:50] &gt;&gt; And Jesus knew who he was. And Jesus
[2:05:53] said to that woman at the well, I am he.
[2:05:56] I that speak unto thee am he.
[2:05:59] &gt;&gt; And they knew their identity regardless
[2:06:01] of all the religious people of the day.
[2:06:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:06:04] &gt;&gt; And our brother Brandham, our messenger
[2:06:06] of this day, knew who he was. That's
[2:06:07] right.
[2:06:08] &gt;&gt; I'm paraphrasing, but there's a place
[2:06:10] where he said, "I'm the one to identify
[2:06:12] his presence."
[2:06:14] &gt;&gt; That's his role to preach a message.
[2:06:16] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:06:16] &gt;&gt; That would actually bring forth the the
[2:06:19] the actual presence of Christ
[2:06:22] &gt;&gt; veiled in flesh in this day.
[2:06:25] &gt;&gt; And you are that identified bride of
[2:06:27] Christ,
[2:06:29] &gt;&gt; Christ manifest in bride form.
[2:06:31] &gt;&gt; And if we know who we are, then we
[2:06:33] become an invincible army. Amen.
[2:06:36] &gt;&gt; Brother said, "If the people get the
[2:06:38] true revelation of the true church and
[2:06:40] what she is, what she stands for, and
[2:06:42] that she can do the greater works, she
[2:06:44] will be an invincible harmony."
[2:06:46] &gt;&gt; If they get a true revelation of the two
[2:06:48] spirits within the framework of the
[2:06:50] Christian church,
[2:06:51] &gt;&gt; Satan will be powerless before.
[2:06:54] &gt;&gt; Why will Satan be powerless?
[2:06:56] &gt;&gt; Because we know
[2:06:58] &gt;&gt; what it is.
[2:07:00] &gt;&gt; Like we were just talking back there in
[2:07:02] the office. It's that guy that messes up
[2:07:04] the the the monitor. That guy when you
[2:07:07] begin to recognize it's the devil. It's
[2:07:08] the devil hindering you from coming to
[2:07:10] church causing all that traffic jam.
[2:07:12] It's the devil at work. When you begin
[2:07:14] to recognize who it is that that mind
[2:07:17] battle, who that has given you them
[2:07:19] those thoughts that are contrary to the
[2:07:21] word and you can cast down reasonings,
[2:07:23] cast down imaginations because you're
[2:07:26] recognizing what it is.
[2:07:28] Oh, it's time in this hour not for
[2:07:30] partial identification but for full.
[2:07:33] &gt;&gt; It's the age of full identification.
[2:07:37] &gt;&gt; Can you see now your identification?
[2:07:40] &gt;&gt; As the musicians come forward,
[2:07:43] &gt;&gt; we'll close on this.
[2:07:45] &gt;&gt; Can you see your identification now
[2:07:47] where you stand?
[2:07:50] &gt;&gt; Who would we identify with as we look
[2:07:52] through all these characters in the
[2:07:53] scripture? Uh-huh.
[2:07:55] &gt;&gt; Would we identify ourselves with the
[2:07:56] Balum who said there ain't no difference
[2:07:59] &gt;&gt; or with a Judas,
[2:08:01] &gt;&gt; the one that can't quite understand the
[2:08:03] mystery of Jesus, what he's doing, what
[2:08:05] his purpose is.
[2:08:07] &gt;&gt; Who would we identify ourselves with?
[2:08:10] Would we identify oursel in this day
[2:08:12] with a new haircut?
[2:08:14] &gt;&gt; Would we identify ourselves with how
[2:08:16] fancy we can dress?
[2:08:18] &gt;&gt; Would we identify oursel how popular we
[2:08:20] can stand and speak?
[2:08:24] musicians can go ahead and come forward
[2:08:25] and we'll just close on this.
[2:08:28] &gt;&gt; Do we identify ourselves with how much
[2:08:30] education we got?
[2:08:32] &gt;&gt; When Paul said them things, he had to
[2:08:34] forget them in order to know Christ.
[2:08:36] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:08:37] &gt;&gt; Or are we identifying Pentecost?
[2:08:40] What are we identifying?
[2:08:42] Paul said in Philippians, "Let this mind
[2:08:45] be in you which was also in Christ
[2:08:47] Jesus."
[2:08:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. who being in the form of God,
[2:08:50] thought it not robbery to be equal with
[2:08:52] God,
[2:08:54] &gt;&gt; but made himself of no reputation.
[2:08:57] &gt;&gt; Oh, that's the kind of nature that was
[2:08:59] in Christ,
[2:09:00] &gt;&gt; and took upon him the form of a servant.
[2:09:02] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:09:03] &gt;&gt; And was made in the likeness of men. And
[2:09:05] being found in fashion as a man, he
[2:09:08] humbled himself and became obedient to
[2:09:10] death,
[2:09:11] &gt;&gt; even the death of the cross.
[2:09:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:09:14] &gt;&gt; Oh, God. What God wants us to do, I
[2:09:15] believe, in this hour is surrender to
[2:09:17] him. Amen.
[2:09:18] &gt;&gt; Surrender.
[2:09:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:09:20] &gt;&gt; To be obedient even to death.
[2:09:22] &gt;&gt; Or we can lay down our lives to him.
[2:09:25] Surrender and let God take come and take
[2:09:27] control.
[2:09:29] Come and take control of our lives.
[2:09:32] &gt;&gt; I wonder as the musicians just play
[2:09:34] softly.
[2:09:36] Maybe we could stand to our feet. If we
[2:09:38] examine ourselves as we look into the
[2:09:40] mirror of God's word, what do we
[2:09:42] identify with?
[2:09:49] Maybe we look into the mirror of God's
[2:09:50] word as God is dealing with us in as
[2:09:53] individuals and recognize that there's
[2:09:56] things lacking in our life.
[2:09:59] Maybe we look into the mirror of God's
[2:10:01] word and see, well, I I didn't think I'd
[2:10:04] look like that.
[2:10:06] I I I didn't I thought I I thought I
[2:10:09] looked different. is the word. The
[2:10:11] mirror of God's word reveals
[2:10:14] what's hidden beneath that veil of
[2:10:17] flesh.
[2:10:19] We look into the mirror of God's word
[2:10:20] and we can see how we really are.
[2:10:24] Well, maybe tonight we look into the
[2:10:26] mirror of God's word and we see that
[2:10:27] [music]
[2:10:28] maybe we thought we weren't
[2:10:33] maybe we thought we had so many faults
[2:10:35] and [music] problems,
[2:10:37] but we look in the mirror of God's word
[2:10:38] and we see God's nature begin to be
[2:10:40] reflected back.
[2:10:43] Maybe we we we can see where [music] we
[2:10:46] fail and we make so many problems so
[2:10:48] many times,
[2:10:50] but we look into the mirror of God's
[2:10:51] word and we recognize
[2:10:54] that we're a son and daughter of God.
[2:10:58] We look into the mirror of God's word
[2:10:59] and see what we really are.
[2:11:02] Let's just bow our heads and go to the
[2:11:04] author. Lord God, you gave us your word
[2:11:08] so that we could see, so that we could
[2:11:09] understand.
[2:11:12] Lord God, I thank you for understanding
[2:11:14] tonight.
[2:11:14] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:11:16] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord, for revelation power,
[2:11:19] not just to reveal the hidden mysteries
[2:11:21] and the deep secrets of your word, but
[2:11:23] to reveal what we are and who we are.
[2:11:28] And I pray tonight, Lord Jesus, that the
[2:11:30] words that have been said and the words
[2:11:31] have been spoken, [music] Lord, have
[2:11:33] sparked a desire in us, Lord Jesus, to
[2:11:35] know who we are, to see who we are.
[2:11:40] The only way we can see is by looking
[2:11:42] into your word,
[2:11:44] Lord. Your word speaks back to [music]
[2:11:46] us. And it always speaks the truth. It
[2:11:49] always tells the truth. We might come
[2:11:51] with our own ideas, with our own
[2:11:53] thoughts, with [music] our own
[2:11:54] preconceived notions, but we when we
[2:11:56] look into the word, it it tells the
[2:11:58] truth. Lord, we want the truth tonight.
[2:12:03] Lord, I believe that there's still a
[2:12:04] deep calling to the deep, Lord Jesus.
[2:12:07] Lord, as your word is dealing with
[2:12:09] individuals, Lord Jesus, Lord, maybe
[2:12:11] there's somebody that recognizes that
[2:12:13] there's something something lacking in
[2:12:15] their life that they need that maybe
[2:12:17] that all this time they they've been
[2:12:19] behaving like a servant and trying to
[2:12:22] trying to do things so that they could
[2:12:25] not get fussed on or so that they could
[2:12:28] get wages so that they could
[2:12:31] garner somebody's approval.
[2:12:34] &gt;&gt; Lord, we don't want to be like that.
[2:12:37] We want it to be an inward work, Lord
[2:12:39] God, where you change us into sons and
[2:12:42] daughters of the living God. I pray,
[2:12:45] Lord, if there is anyone here tonight,
[2:12:47] Lord Jesus, that wants more of you,
[2:12:49] Lord, that you'll reach out and touch,
[2:12:51] deal with their heart, Lord Jesus, and
[2:12:53] prick them, Lord Jesus, like you
[2:12:54] pricricked Paul who kicked against the
[2:12:57] pricks until you ran him down. Lord
[2:13:00] Jesus, deal with each one, Lord God. I
[2:13:02] just ask a special blessing upon this
[2:13:04] church, Lord God. That you'll continue
[2:13:06] to bless their pastor, Lord Jesus. He's
[2:13:09] running with the message of Malachi 4. I
[2:13:11] pray, God, that you'll give him strength
[2:13:12] and encouragement, Lord God. Be with
[2:13:14] this church, Lord Jesus, that you'll
[2:13:16] guide and strengthen and bless them,
[2:13:18] Lord God. That they'll continue to walk
[2:13:20] in your power, Lord God.
[2:13:22] &gt;&gt; Lord, we just give the remainder of this
[2:13:24] service to you, Lord Jesus, as we close
[2:13:26] it. The words have been said, the word
[2:13:29] songs have been sung, Lord. Now you take
[2:13:30] it, Lord God, and spin it deep into each
[2:13:32] heart, Lord God, and convict and deal,
[2:13:34] Lord God. We just ask your blessing now
[2:13:38] in your name. Amen.
[2:13:41] God bless you, saints. Turn it over to
[2:13:43] the pastor.
[2:13:45] [applause]
[2:13:46] [music]
[2:13:51] [applause]
[2:13:58] Praise God.
[2:13:59] Amen.
[2:14:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:14:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:14:02] &gt;&gt; Who are you?
[2:14:05] &gt;&gt; You know who you are.
[2:14:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:14:09] &gt;&gt; The Bible says in Psalm 82, you are God.
[2:14:14] &gt;&gt; Is that too strong still?
[2:14:16] &gt;&gt; We went through this for three months.
[2:14:19] The Bible say ye are gods.
[2:14:21] &gt;&gt; If you have a problem, go to Psalm 82.
[2:14:23] The Bible say ye are gods
[2:14:25] &gt;&gt; and all of you are children of the most
[2:14:28] high.
[2:14:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:14:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:14:33] &gt;&gt; If you ask my wife when I when we were
[2:14:35] driving in u church toward the church
[2:14:38] tonight, she can tell you what I told
[2:14:40] her exactly the sermon. I didn't talk to
[2:14:44] brother about what uh what what quote
[2:14:47] and whatever he's going to read today.
[2:14:49] No.
[2:14:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:14:51] You got to know who you are.
[2:14:54] &gt;&gt; And you got to stop all the labels that
[2:14:58] has been put in your life.
[2:15:01] &gt;&gt; Peel them off.
[2:15:05] &gt;&gt; You didn't get me.
[2:15:06] &gt;&gt; Peel them off and put them in the trash.
[2:15:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:15:11] &gt;&gt; They told you you are scary. You are
[2:15:14] whatever. You don't know what to do. You
[2:15:16] are not intelligent. You cannot make it.
[2:15:19] You are chicken. Whatever they say,
[2:15:22] &gt;&gt; peel them off.
[2:15:25] &gt;&gt; They told you you complicated.
[2:15:28] &gt;&gt; Go ask that person, what is the
[2:15:30] definition of complication?
[2:15:33] &gt;&gt; Complication to what?
[2:15:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:15:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:15:37] &gt;&gt; The final, the final, the absolute is
[2:15:40] the word of God.
[2:15:43] &gt;&gt; Do you know that David was called by his
[2:15:46] own brother that he was proud? It's
[2:15:49] written in the Bible.
[2:15:50] &gt;&gt; Just by asking what are they going to do
[2:15:53] to this guy over there?
[2:15:56] &gt;&gt; You were there 40 days.
[2:15:58] &gt;&gt; You were trembling.
[2:16:00] &gt;&gt; I just came in. I'm asking a question.
[2:16:03] What are we going to do to the guy that
[2:16:06] is going to call kill that person over
[2:16:08] there? Oh, you proud. Now you want to
[2:16:11] show the naughtiness of your heart. This
[2:16:13] is what is written in the Bible.
[2:16:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:16:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:16:16] &gt;&gt; Why? Because somebody's coming with a
[2:16:18] revelation.
[2:16:20] &gt;&gt; Somebody's coming with a new energy.
[2:16:23] &gt;&gt; And because you're coming with a new
[2:16:25] energy, everybody want you to behave
[2:16:27] like everybody else.
[2:16:28] &gt;&gt; I'm not going to behave like everybody
[2:16:30] else.
[2:16:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. If it didn't work for the people
[2:16:34] before, it's going to work for me. Why?
[2:16:37] Because God dealt with me individually.
[2:16:40] I know who I am and I know what God told
[2:16:44] me.
[2:16:46] Amen.
[2:16:47] Amen.
[2:16:49] Amen. We have defined our own
[2:16:52] Christianity in this message and we
[2:16:55] label people by it.
[2:16:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:16:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:17:00] &gt;&gt; If you ask somebody what is humility
[2:17:03] &gt;&gt; in this message they will tell you
[2:17:04] walking like this.
[2:17:08] &gt;&gt; They will walk you I mean uh talking to
[2:17:10] people like this that's the that that
[2:17:13] comes from a Catholic church.
[2:17:15] You bu your nature. God built you a
[2:17:18] certain way.
[2:17:19] &gt;&gt; Some people are quiet. Some people are
[2:17:22] outspoken. But we want the one who is
[2:17:24] quiet and the one who's outspoken, both
[2:17:27] of them to be under the word.
[2:17:31] [applause and cheering]
[2:17:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. You say amen. You didn't
[2:17:35] sin. You quiet. You say amen. You didn't
[2:17:38] sin. But don't judge the one who's
[2:17:40] saying amen loud
[2:17:42] &gt;&gt; that he has a problem. And don't judge
[2:17:44] the one who's quiet that he got a
[2:17:46] problem. You be yourself.
[2:17:49] &gt;&gt; Know who you are.
[2:17:53] [cheering]
[2:17:55] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:17:57] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:17:58] &gt;&gt; I was telling somebody I say they say
[2:18:01] this and this posted something. I say
[2:18:03] forget about the posting.
[2:18:04] &gt;&gt; I say block even those people.
[2:18:07] &gt;&gt; I say you don't have to look at the
[2:18:09] posting of somebody that don't like you.
[2:18:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. If somebody put on the posting,
[2:18:14] you are Judas. Are you Judas?
[2:18:17] &gt;&gt; So, learn how to separate whatever
[2:18:19] people say with what God told me. God
[2:18:23] already touched my heart. God gave me a
[2:18:26] revelation that I am the bride.
[2:18:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:18:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:18:31] &gt;&gt; The Bible say where the carcass is,
[2:18:35] &gt;&gt; that's where the water.
[2:18:37] &gt;&gt; So, if I am where the carcass is, what
[2:18:40] is my nature? Hallelujah.
[2:18:42] &gt;&gt; What is in me that is attracted to this
[2:18:44] message?
[2:18:46] [cheering]
[2:18:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:18:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:18:50] &gt;&gt; Why is it that something about me is
[2:18:52] pulsating with this message?
[2:18:55] &gt;&gt; Maybe I don't understand it, but I say
[2:18:57] this is nothing but the truth.
[2:19:00] [cheering]
[2:19:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:19:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:19:05] &gt;&gt; One day I was reading brother Brandham's
[2:19:08] book and then I stopped. Then I begin to
[2:19:11] meditate. Then a thoughts came and I and
[2:19:14] I have a clear thought of it. And I went
[2:19:17] back and continued to read and
[2:19:19] everything that came to me is exactly
[2:19:21] what was after where I stopped.
[2:19:23] &gt;&gt; How can me and brother match after so
[2:19:26] many years.
[2:19:28] &gt;&gt; Now you will tell me I am not a son of
[2:19:30] God because I was not there.
[2:19:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[2:19:35] &gt;&gt; No, it is the same God
[2:19:38] &gt;&gt; that was with brother Brham is the same
[2:19:40] God that is anointing us.
[2:19:43] &gt;&gt; You need to know who you are.
[2:19:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. And stick with what God told you
[2:19:49] to be
[2:19:50] &gt;&gt; and move forward regardless of what
[2:19:53] people will say.
[2:19:55] &gt;&gt; People will change
[2:19:57] &gt;&gt; if you stick to your identity.
[2:20:00] [cheering]
[2:20:03] I'm not trying to preach.
[2:20:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:20:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:20:08] &gt;&gt; People will eventually change
[2:20:12] &gt;&gt; if you stick with your identity.
[2:20:17] &gt;&gt; I don't know if you get what I'm saying.
[2:20:19] &gt;&gt; One day, poor Paul,
[2:20:23] &gt;&gt; given the vision by the angel of the
[2:20:25] Lord,
[2:20:27] &gt;&gt; step in the Allen.
[2:20:29] &gt;&gt; That's right. went and picking up the
[2:20:32] what do you call I mean stick
[2:20:35] &gt;&gt; to warm people and to kindle the fire
[2:20:38] and what happened to Paul
[2:20:40] &gt;&gt; he got beaten by a serpent
[2:20:42] &gt;&gt; do you know what people begin to say
[2:20:44] early on
[2:20:45] &gt;&gt; they say this was a criminal
[2:20:48] &gt;&gt; because he he just missed death over
[2:20:50] there on the boat now he follows him the
[2:20:54] curse follow him was Paul a criminal
[2:20:57] &gt;&gt; Paul was actually put there innocent
[2:21:02] but because something happened to him.
[2:21:05] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:21:06] &gt;&gt; He was interpreted as a criminal. Sister
[2:21:09] Divine.
[2:21:11] &gt;&gt; Because something happened.
[2:21:13] &gt;&gt; Because an accident happened. Who told
[2:21:15] you you a criminal because an accident
[2:21:17] happened?
[2:21:18] &gt;&gt; What? What did Job do?
[2:21:22] &gt;&gt; What did Job do to receive all the trial
[2:21:25] that he got?
[2:21:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. And the believer came and begin to
[2:21:30] condemn Job that there is no way you can
[2:21:33] go through such a trial without you
[2:21:36] being doing something wrong. Did Job do
[2:21:39] anything wrong? You got to know who you
[2:21:42] are. [cheering and applause]
[2:21:44] You got to know who you are. No matter
[2:21:46] what is happening in your life, remember
[2:21:50] who you are. [screaming]
[2:21:51] [cheering]
[2:21:55] &gt;&gt; I'm going to finish with this. Did Jesus
[2:21:57] sin?
[2:21:58] &gt;&gt; No.
[2:21:58] &gt;&gt; So everything that was happened with for
[2:22:01] uh with uh Jesus Christ, what wrong have
[2:22:04] he done?
[2:22:06] &gt;&gt; So if you judge by the trial,
[2:22:09] &gt;&gt; what type of trial did Jesus have?
[2:22:12] &gt;&gt; Did he change him?
[2:22:14] &gt;&gt; As a matter of fact, they coming to
[2:22:16] arrest him and he keep healing people.
[2:22:19] &gt;&gt; They cut somebody's ear. He just
[2:22:21] remember who he was. He pick up the ear
[2:22:24] and put it back and continue on his road
[2:22:27] because Calvary was on this path. And
[2:22:30] even at the cross when he was naked, he
[2:22:34] turned around and gave somebody life
[2:22:37] because he knew who he was. And when
[2:22:40] somebody recognized him, he gave him
[2:22:42] life. Regardless of where you are now,
[2:22:46] whether on the mountain or on the
[2:22:48] valley, remember who you are. God save
[2:22:52] you this far. You are a son of God. You
[2:22:55] are a daughter of God. There is a reason
[2:22:57] why God is on you because you are his
[2:23:01] bride. And there is a reason why the
[2:23:04] devil is troubling you all the time
[2:23:06] because there is something good about
[2:23:08] you. Because you don't belong to his
[2:23:11] kingdom. You belong to another kingdom.
[2:23:14] You have declared war. [screaming]
[2:23:16] [cheering]
[2:23:17] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Remember you who who
[2:23:20] you are.
[2:23:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:23:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:23:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:23:25] &gt;&gt; As long as I know who I am,
[2:23:28] &gt;&gt; I don't care what you say about me.
[2:23:35] &gt;&gt; We trying to control people mouth.
[2:23:38] &gt;&gt; We trying to control people's social
[2:23:40] media. Leave them alone.
[2:23:42] &gt;&gt; Focus on your objective.
[2:23:44] &gt;&gt; Like the boy with the bike. Yes, sir.
[2:23:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:23:48] &gt;&gt; Keep your eyes straight.
[2:23:50] &gt;&gt; If you look around, you're going to
[2:23:51] fall.
[2:23:52] &gt;&gt; Keep your eyes straight.
[2:23:54] &gt;&gt; Know who you are.
[2:23:56] &gt;&gt; I know what I used to be.
[2:23:59] &gt;&gt; I know what I am now.
[2:24:01] &gt;&gt; You I don't need you to tell me that God
[2:24:04] is alive. I know my God is alive. I
[2:24:07] don't need to tell me what God talk
[2:24:09] about me when I read the message. I know
[2:24:12] God is talking to me. I know because he
[2:24:15] say I will send you
[2:24:18] &gt;&gt; brother Stephen Elijah the prophet.
[2:24:21] &gt;&gt; Elijah already came and the word found
[2:24:24] me.
[2:24:25] &gt;&gt; So the you that is written on Malachi is
[2:24:28] me.
[2:24:29] &gt;&gt; I don't know about you. I'm talking
[2:24:31] about me. When they say I will send you,
[2:24:33] the you is me.
[2:24:35] &gt;&gt; So I am in Malachi 4 and I am the
[2:24:38] reflection of Malachi 4. I am the
[2:24:41] scripture made manifested.
[2:24:45] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:24:47] &gt;&gt; Are we together? So stay strong in your
[2:24:50] faith
[2:24:51] &gt;&gt; and know who you are. [screaming]
[2:24:55] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. Wonderful. Brother
[2:24:58] Bob,

[2:25:22] &gt;&gt; Say, "I am a mighty man of valor

[2:25:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. [clears throat]
[2:25:30] &gt;&gt; Good to see you, Sister Jerusha.
[2:25:35] [laughter]

[2:28:22] give us travel mercy and protect us all
[2:28:25] under the blood. Father, we rebuke every
[2:28:28] demonic spirit of accident, [music]
[2:28:30] of trouble, any tragedy. May you protect
[2:28:33] everyone that came in and the church
