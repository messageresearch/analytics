[34:53] well you should see them in a service
[34:56] they need our love they need a support
[34:58] they need our prayer amen
[35:00] and on sunday evening lord's willing
[35:02] between
[35:04] five o'clock and nine pm we only have
[35:06] four hours so i'm just waiting for the
[35:09] family to tell me what they wanted to do
[35:11] within those four hours but we only have
[35:13] four hours just to sit down talk about
[35:15] our sister and have a little reception

[35:23] continue to remember the family in
[35:26] prayer amen
[35:28] sooner everybody will begin to go to
[35:30] their home and do their own things and

[35:45] if anybody is not here tonight i know
[35:47] they're recording the service but we
[35:49] have a problem with our internet so
[35:51] thank god but if brother david was able
[35:54] to record the service so it should be

[41:10] it's wednesday night god bless you
[41:12] sister and all those that are not here
[41:15] our prayers are with you
[41:18] let's look at genesis 1
[41:23] hallelujah
[41:25] and verse 1
[41:28] she have it say amen
[41:30] in the beginning god created the heaven
[41:33] and the earth
[41:35] may the lord add a blessing to the
[41:37] reading of his word you may be seated
[41:41] and we read another scripture
[41:43] over here in
[41:45] psalms 33 and 6. he says by the word
[41:49] of the lord where the heavens made
[41:52] and all the hosts of him by the breath
[41:55] of his mouth amen you know after you
[41:58] look and see what the lord did for us
[42:00] sonny how you how can you get away from
[42:03] the mouth
[42:04] the tongue
[42:06] and the lips
[42:08] i couldn't get away from it if i wanted
[42:10] to
[42:10] i'll tell you i got this inspiration
[42:12] what we're going to look at here tonight
[42:14] is
[42:15] the spoken word is the original seed of
[42:17] god
[42:19] now when you start dealing with the
[42:20] spoken word of the original seed of god
[42:23] you know the ones that study this
[42:25] message i need your prayers tonight
[42:28] because even the prophet it took him six
[42:30] hours he went through this six hours in
[42:32] this message
[42:34] so you have to understand i tell you
[42:36] could take a message a nugget out of
[42:38] this and preach it from now until the
[42:40] rapture take place if you go back and
[42:43] and i beseech you my brothers and
[42:45] sisters go look into that message it's a
[42:48] timely message when god has anointed for
[42:52] this time here now
[42:54] you know we look at because in the
[42:55] beginning we know god created what the
[42:58] heavens and the earth
[43:00] and god he said
[43:02] when he spoke there that's why we're
[43:04] talking about the infallible word of god
[43:08] and then god he came he said god said
[43:10] let there be one
[43:12] light is that right who said let there
[43:14] be light god said it so if god says
[43:18] something then that means it has to
[43:20] happen is that right you don't have to
[43:22] worry about anything in this hour here
[43:25] now okay
[43:26] i'm telling you if god said it he's got
[43:29] a witness from the beginning it's going
[43:31] to happen is that right hallelujah
[43:35] and god saw the light and then it was
[43:38] good and god divided the light from the
[43:40] darkness and god called the light what
[43:43] they
[43:44] god called the light day is that right
[43:47] so god called the light they then it's
[43:49] going to be day is that right the word
[43:51] of god is infallible is that right so
[43:55] we're moving into something when god
[43:57] start talking about opening about your
[44:00] tongue and your mouth and your lips
[44:02] that's a powerful thing what god wants
[44:05] to do now is bring you back into
[44:08] authority
[44:10] that's exactly what he's doing we're
[44:12] talking about the spoken word is that
[44:15] right when you start talking about the
[44:18] spoken word is the original seed now
[44:22] we're going to take our time
[44:24] because i'm not going to get all this
[44:26] done tonight i don't know why the pastor
[44:29] wants this spare tire up here you know
[44:31] that but i'm telling you now we're going
[44:34] to move into it slowly we got scriptures
[44:37] and we're going to move in because what
[44:39] it's bringing you back to is your origin
[44:42] where you come from now we're talking
[44:44] about something that powerful so the
[44:47] spoken word is the original seed is that
[44:50] right so we know that we was not
[44:52] originally supposed to come from sex is
[44:55] that right
[44:56] originally it was supposed to come it
[44:58] was going to happen it was going to come
[45:00] to pass but eve then what she got
[45:03] deceived by the serpent is that right
[45:06] but we were
[45:07] if we were a spoken word we were in the
[45:10] back of the mind of god is that right if
[45:13] we were out there all in the universe
[45:16] and god was out there all alone so god
[45:19] he was what elohim is that right then he
[45:22] became jehovah he said but now once god
[45:26] came and he sought to let there be light
[45:29] and he moved the waters is that right
[45:31] then everything no seed had to do what
[45:34] bring forth of its kind is that right
[45:38] but where were we at we're in the mind
[45:40] of god god created it says in the
[45:43] beginning is that right that's why you
[45:46] got these intellectuals these scientists
[45:48] and the people out here fussing about a
[45:51] time
[45:52] huh let me read something for you here's
[45:56] out of the fourth seal and like i said i
[45:58] don't have the board so i'm have to read
[46:00] it and keep moving he said this is out
[46:02] of the fourth seal remember someone
[46:04] approached the prophet of god about the
[46:06] the number of years it took to make of
[46:09] heavens and the earth is that right he
[46:12] said that uh i said that didn't have
[46:15] anything to do in genesis genesis 1 says
[46:18] in the beginning is that right that we
[46:21] were in the beginning so how can you put
[46:25] a beginning on god
[46:27] [Music]
[46:31] in the beginning now we're moving into
[46:34] the mind of god tonight have your way
[46:36] lord have your way on this we're moving
[46:39] into the mind of god tonight god didn't
[46:42] speak until over the world the third
[46:45] verse is that right so that means you
[46:47] were in the mind of god we were in the
[46:49] rain of god when god said let there be
[46:52] light the logos went out right that was
[46:55] christ the spirit of god went all over
[46:57] the land
[47:02] we're going to look into the scriptures
[47:04] we're going to see why how blessed you
[47:06] are you're going to see that you are the
[47:08] seed of christ you are the seed of god
[47:12] you are the ones that god has saved the
[47:15] best for life we in the real world but
[47:17] we got the victory the victories is our
[47:22] we're taking everything back and not
[47:25] losing the one
[47:37] [Music]
[47:45] that's why god wants you to control your
[47:50] tongue no way
[47:53] no way a man could have opened that god
[47:55] open that up now is the time now he's
[47:58] bringing us into it brother
[48:04] god spoke it we ain't got to the mind
[48:07] yet
[48:08] god spoke it is that right if god said
[48:11] it i believe it then that's it
[48:14] stand on it is that right
[48:17] look what he said
[48:18] he said now in the beginning
[48:21] god created the heavens and the earth
[48:23] said period
[48:25] he said that's all now the world was out
[48:28] of form and void just like it's getting
[48:30] to be a mess now three four dollars of
[48:32] gasoline stocks going down they don't
[48:34] know what to do he said now look
[48:36] he says but
[48:38] now in the world without reforming i
[48:40] believe every seed
[48:42] was laying right there
[48:44] from some other civilization or
[48:47] something as soon as the water lifted
[48:50] off the light struck it
[48:53] and come trees and everything else
[48:56] oh but look at us and the same thing
[48:58] with the human being
[49:00] he said a type when all the myths moved
[49:03] away and revealed truth to the real sea
[49:06] laying there it's still germantized
[49:10] see everybody we're going to show you
[49:11] through the scriptures only the elector
[49:15] he saved the best for last
[49:18] only elect is the one that i have what
[49:21] they're going to be able to see and hear
[49:24] what you're hearing right now okay
[49:28] help me lord he said now he said laying
[49:31] there is still germatized if i don't get
[49:34] through it keep in mind that word
[49:36] dermatized he said now he said in the
[49:39] light of the gospel can strike it by
[49:42] truth in vindication of the word he said
[49:45] it'll live it's got life in it
[49:49] i'll it'll believe see you to believe
[49:52] it'll live the only way you're living
[49:55] here now is because you got life inside
[49:58] of you
[49:59] huh
[50:01] you got it inside of you now you see why
[50:04] i said we should be the happiest people
[50:06] in the land right now all right we know
[50:09] where we come from we know where we're
[50:10] going we know why we're sent here is
[50:13] that right
[50:14] hallelujah
[50:16] he said now look outside of that it
[50:19] can't live it hasn't got life so now
[50:22] we're moving
[50:23] i don't know who's live streaming but
[50:26] you may hear some things tonight and
[50:28] that i hope and shake you and get you
[50:30] right
[50:31] because we're not going to hold any
[50:33] punches we're talking about winning soul
[50:35] we're talking about you in a war we're
[50:37] talking about the authentic word of god
[50:41] it's supposed to produce what it's
[50:42] supposed to produce in this age right
[50:45] now you're not going to turn them god
[50:48] didn't just have you here for no reason
[50:50] at all he hit us and saved the best for
[50:52] last his bride is that right on his
[50:55] precious bride look what he says here
[50:58] we read down there
[51:00] i'm still in the message
[51:02] god spoke the original seed
[51:05] if you're taking your notes
[51:06] and we reverse uh paragraph 30. he said
[51:10] now this word of god is eternal
[51:14] god being infinite cannot speak one
[51:17] thing and then later on change it to
[51:20] something else why are we not taking him
[51:24] and speaking him and believing his word
[51:27] for just what he said
[51:31] [Music]
[51:32] you don't have to be afraid to speak
[51:34] anything is that right if god said it
[51:38] it's a promise under you it's yours
[51:41] don't be afraid god's going to bring it
[51:43] to pass when he sees fit to bring it to
[51:45] pass but he's going to bring it to pass
[51:48] because what we're asking we're asking
[51:50] according to his will not our will
[51:55] [Applause]
[51:58] he said now look
[51:59] he says now god he can change it to
[52:02] something else he can't change it better
[52:04] he can't go to a better decision
[52:07] huh
[52:08] that's right brother no huh
[52:11] he said because every decision of god is
[52:14] what
[52:15] ah
[52:22] he was what perfect right he found what
[52:26] grace and with god is that right because
[52:30] he walked with the white the lord told
[52:32] us sunday what the rain
[52:34] when we spoke he spoke the way
[52:38] now you're walking perfectly with god
[52:41] because you know we can't change
[52:51] life and death lies in the tongue look
[52:53] over to genesis 6.
[52:55] let's go to genesis 6 help us lord
[52:58] he said now look
[53:03] hallelujah
[53:04] who are we walking there uh let's look
[53:06] at verse eight
[53:10] the purpose of the lord in grace
[53:12] he says but noah found grace in the eyes
[53:15] of the lord
[53:20] he said these are the generations
[53:23] noah noah was a just man
[53:26] any what perfect in his generation and
[53:30] noah did what walk with god
[53:34] huh
[53:35] scripture backed it up the word is what
[53:38] perfect is that right we got the what
[53:41] the perfect word is that right we got
[53:43] the infallible word of god is that right
[53:47] we're not going to fail anything is not
[53:49] going to fail is that right god has
[53:51] given us the absolute let me keep going
[53:54] because i got many scriptures i want you
[53:56] to see
[53:57] he said now
[53:58] he said now this
[54:00] he said because
[54:01] every decision of god is perfect
[54:04] he cannot once his word is once spoken
[54:08] it can never die it can never die
[54:11] there's a life in his words
[54:14] look what he says he says now he said
[54:16] that he could never die it lives on and
[54:18] on never dies because why because it's
[54:22] god
[54:23] his word is eternal god is eternal is
[54:27] that right he's a supernatural god he
[54:30] made man in his image is that right he
[54:33] was a superman from the beginning is
[54:35] that right
[54:36] god made him in his image and his
[54:38] likeness because god wanted to do what
[54:41] god wanted to be worshipped is that
[54:43] right
[54:44] look at the hebrew definition we wrote
[54:47] down here
[54:49] beginning
[54:54] he said in the beginning god wanted to
[54:57] be worshipped
[54:58] he said now jesus he said now what if i
[55:02] if i be lifted up from the earth then
[55:05] i'll draw all men unto me
[55:07] look at the hebrew definition if you're
[55:09] writing it down you could go home and
[55:10] check is the hebrew translation is 7 2
[55:14] 18 just bear with me in your strong
[55:17] 72 25 and what he said is what is first
[55:22] what is the beginning
[55:24] the beginning is was first
[55:26] he said that christ the head of the body
[55:29] he says high
[55:31] high he's in authority is that right
[55:34] it's jesus christ he said the source now
[55:38] but it also is the beginning the
[55:40] beginning is your source and your origin
[55:46] amen
[55:47] again you see to lift up the head to
[55:50] restore through what to restore the
[55:52] position
[55:54] okay he was saying that now just bear
[55:56] with me he said now look
[55:59] john said in the beginning was the word
[56:01] the word was god the word was with god
[56:02] and the word was made flesh is that
[56:04] right
[56:05] he said that was the beginning and with
[56:07] his eternal purpose came on over was
[56:10] made flesh and dwelt among us what was
[56:13] it it was god's word is that right in
[56:16] the beginning god was made those that's
[56:18] that's john chapter 1 1 and 14. he says
[56:21] in the beginning was the word the word
[56:22] became flesh is that right so now when
[56:24] the word came on this earth here the
[56:26] word was sent for a purpose is that
[56:28] right so when the logos went out and
[56:31] that little light came down that you see
[56:33] over brother branham's head is that
[56:35] right he came down and small and
[56:37] dwelling what in each and every one of
[56:39] us is that right so that's where he's
[56:41] dwelling that now in the hearts of
[56:43] mankind he said now so out of the heart
[56:46] the abundance does the what the mouth
[56:49] speaketh is that right so god's down in
[56:52] in your heart he got down they put that
[56:54] seed there before the foundation of the
[56:57] world
[56:58] hallelujah
[57:00] let us keep going he said now what the
[57:03] voice of god is perfect we went over
[57:05] that so if a man if you get there and
[57:07] you say something wrong
[57:08] we're not like god we don't own this
[57:10] earth we got five contacts see taste
[57:14] fill smell and hear so we can contact
[57:17] this earthly body is that right
[57:19] so we know it is our enough then the
[57:21] holy spirit been telling us some people
[57:24] think they don't have the holy ghost and
[57:26] some people think they have the holy
[57:28] ghost you don't have the holy ghost is
[57:29] that right but you don't have to worry
[57:31] about it god promised he's not going to
[57:33] lose not a one is that right we're going
[57:36] to show you the mystery the mysteries
[57:38] that you're sitting under why you think
[57:40] the devil was fighting us and want to
[57:42] fight the pastor and say you don't need
[57:44] you don't need a whole mysteries why
[57:46] they need all those mysteries now why
[57:48] because god promised it and god's word
[57:51] is perfect and so the true seed wants it
[57:54] they want every word that proceedeth out
[57:57] of the mouth of god that's what he said

[1:01:52] going to be it no no no no the latter
[1:01:55] ain't couldn't come until the teaching
[1:01:56] reign had to come is that right so now
[1:01:59] we're looking look up your redemption is
[1:02:02] so near saints because you see now after
[1:02:05] there's going to be an explosion in his
[1:02:07] bride is that right god is making sure
[1:02:10] he's done restoring his word back to us
[1:02:13] now he's bringing us bringing us about
[1:02:15] to what to lift is that right
[1:02:18] live for life lies in that tongue he's
[1:02:20] telling you now when they was in
[1:02:22] tormented they tore me in because what
[1:02:24] he was spoke on their self is that right
[1:02:27] why did he say touch my what let me have
[1:02:29] a drop of water is that right that's my
[1:02:33] scorching tongue hallelujah that was a
[1:02:36] nugget hit in there why because now
[1:02:40] we're getting he rejecting what the
[1:02:43] water of the world he rejected the word
[1:02:46] that was brought to him that would have
[1:02:48] kept him out of hell when jesus said uh
[1:02:51] we know what you did in your religious
[1:02:53] spirits but you got one thing to do is
[1:02:56] what sell all your goods and give your
[1:02:58] riches to the poor he couldn't do it is
[1:03:01] that right
[1:03:02] so he ended up in hell is that right
[1:03:05] those that are rejecting the word in his
[1:03:08] hour here now they're not going to get
[1:03:10] away well i don't want to get ahead of
[1:03:12] myself i want you to see this he wants
[1:03:14] you to see him say what the lord is
[1:03:16] really doing for us how much he loves us
[1:03:18] how much he's opening his word is that
[1:03:20] right
[1:03:21] you tell you he said now look
[1:03:24] he says this is it he said now this is i
[1:03:28] know what to do wherever that you can
[1:03:30] lay your hands and say this is it do you
[1:03:33] believe this is it this is that's right
[1:03:36] brother oh yeah
[1:03:39] this is it is that right because it's
[1:03:41] producing what the opening of the word
[1:03:44] now the thing that was hidden there for
[1:03:46] you before the foundation of the world
[1:03:49] he said now look what he says he says
[1:03:51] jesus answered them i told you and ye
[1:03:55] believe not the works that i do in my
[1:03:58] father's work name it said they bear
[1:04:01] what witness of me he says but ye
[1:04:05] believe not because ye are not of my
[1:04:08] what sheep as i said unto you we're
[1:04:11] going to keep rolling we're going to
[1:04:12] show you there is those seeds out there
[1:04:15] that's heading to hell is that right so
[1:04:18] there's a torment
[1:04:19] help me lord he said now look
[1:04:22] drop down to 37 and
[1:04:24] verse 37 and 38
[1:04:28] jesus was telling them see if if i do
[1:04:31] not the works of my father believe me
[1:04:33] not
[1:04:34] he says but if i do though ye believe
[1:04:38] not me believe the works that ye may
[1:04:41] know
[1:04:42] and believe that the father is in me and
[1:04:45] i in him is that right so that's the
[1:04:48] same we got greater is he that is in
[1:04:50] thee before what he put the seed in us
[1:04:53] before the foundation of the world is
[1:04:55] that right are we going to get to that's
[1:04:58] why he said put on your whole armor of
[1:05:00] god still with me now you put on your
[1:05:02] whole armor of god which is all the word
[1:05:05] so that you may be able to withstand
[1:05:07] against the wilds and the trickery of
[1:05:09] the devil in his time here is that right
[1:05:11] so now but the word has to be warned by
[1:05:14] the holy spirit isn't that right we're
[1:05:16] going to we want to get to that but we
[1:05:18] want you to see what god is bringing us
[1:05:21] into in his hour and it's so simple the
[1:05:24] mysteries are so simple to a believer
[1:05:27] but it's confounding the ones that's
[1:05:28] just looking right at it because it's
[1:05:30] not for them let me keep going
[1:05:33] he said now look help me lord
[1:05:36] god had the first
[1:05:38] he said now today
[1:05:42] now today we know we're living in a
[1:05:44] hybrid time
[1:05:46] it's a really high breaded time
[1:05:48] you got all these things that's being
[1:05:50] hybrid out here the food the plants you
[1:05:54] got all these uh animals you got these
[1:05:56] things being hydrated out here now it's
[1:05:58] the same source with the words the words
[1:06:01] out here is being hybrided but god has
[1:06:04] given us the spoken word the original
[1:06:07] word god has given us so you just bear
[1:06:10] awareness and the spoken word is the
[1:06:12] original seed
[1:06:14] it's the original seed keep that in mind
[1:06:17] as soon as that word the word of god
[1:06:20] we're going to look at that parable so
[1:06:22] we had to bring the original back to
[1:06:25] what it was what it was in the beginning
[1:06:28] in the beginning was the word when the
[1:06:30] word was spoken the word created the
[1:06:33] heaven the the heaven moved in firmament
[1:06:36] the word did those things is that right
[1:06:39] that's why we're moving you into the
[1:06:41] word if you want someone to pray for you
[1:06:44] and lay hands on you that's fine is that
[1:06:46] right but jesus demonstrated the spoken
[1:06:50] word in the in the gospel is that right
[1:06:53] when many came to him when the woman
[1:06:55] with the issues of blood is that right
[1:06:58] he healed the body by the way the spoken
[1:07:00] word is that right and jairus's daughter
[1:07:03] he healed her by the spoken word is that
[1:07:06] right the saturn servant he healed them
[1:07:09] by the spoken word is that right that
[1:07:12] was for the gentile that was a sign for
[1:07:14] the gentiles
[1:07:16] we're late we'll pray for you but as he
[1:07:18] spoke these words then the holy ghost
[1:07:21] fell upon you we're moving into
[1:07:24] something you got to receive you believe
[1:07:26] that that you have your healings if you
[1:07:29] believe that the word is the infallible
[1:07:32] if you believe the spoken word is going
[1:07:35] to do what it's supposed to do you got
[1:07:37] it always in genesis is that right god's
[1:07:40] word cannot change let there be light
[1:07:43] there was light the same word jesus
[1:07:46] christ is the same yesterday today and
[1:07:49] forever
[1:07:52] the spoken word is the original seed
[1:07:55] we're moving it to the spoken word he
[1:07:58] said now look he said because every
[1:08:01] everything
[1:08:02] that we have and those that write it
[1:08:04] down i'm in paragraph 77
[1:08:06] it says in everything that we have on
[1:08:09] earth today
[1:08:10] in its original form
[1:08:13] it came from the spoken word
[1:08:16] huh that's where it came from let's turn
[1:08:18] to hebrew three i mean hebrews
[1:08:23] right 11.
[1:08:25] everything came from the spoken word
[1:08:29] [Music]
[1:08:31] hallelujah chapter 11 and let's look at
[1:08:34] verse three
[1:08:36] hallelujah i'll start at verse one one
[1:08:39] and read down to three he says now faith
[1:08:42] is the substance of things hoped for for
[1:08:44] the evidence of things not seen he says
[1:08:46] for by it the elders obtain a good
[1:08:49] report he said through what faith
[1:08:52] we understand that the worlds
[1:08:55] ah
[1:08:56] were framed by the word of god
[1:08:59] so that things which are seen were not
[1:09:02] made of things which do appear it's all
[1:09:05] by faith is that right that's why we're
[1:09:08] saying we were in the mind of god
[1:09:10] abraham's staggering not at the promises
[1:09:12] god but he grew stronger and stronger in
[1:09:16] faith at the what the promises of god
[1:09:19] hallelujah he said now look he said
[1:09:23] through faith we understand everything
[1:09:24] was framed he said that's that's what he
[1:09:28] says now you look at it let's prove it
[1:09:31] let's turn over to matthew 20 we got 24
[1:09:34] 35 he says and then you read down there
[1:09:36] verily verily i say unto you this
[1:09:39] generation
[1:09:40] shall not pass till all these things
[1:09:43] will be fulfilled
[1:09:45] you see
[1:09:46] heavens and earth shall pass away but my
[1:09:49] words shall not pass away
[1:09:52] now now you see why the holy spirit is
[1:09:55] getting you to move and speaking the
[1:09:57] word
[1:09:58] because you're going to find out the
[1:10:00] word seed and once the holy spirit comes
[1:10:03] down in your life now in that german sea
[1:10:06] dermatitis seed that's down there in
[1:10:08] your soul
[1:10:10] what is it now it has to be watered is
[1:10:12] that right that's why the teaching has
[1:10:15] to come the first teaching that jesus
[1:10:18] taught was you must be born again
[1:10:22] that was the doctrine that he told him
[1:10:24] everyone couldn't be born again is that
[1:10:26] right
[1:10:27] that's why when they asked him into
[1:10:29] intellectually how can a man be born
[1:10:32] enter his mother's womb again
[1:10:34] what we're looking at here is that now
[1:10:38] god was telling them he must be born
[1:10:40] again of the what of the water and of
[1:10:43] the what spirit
[1:10:45] hallelujah
[1:10:47] since since that scripture came up let
[1:10:49] me read this to you what the prophet
[1:10:51] said about that
[1:10:52] help me lord
[1:10:54] we want you to see this i don't want to
[1:10:56] rush i figured i was going to do it like
[1:10:58] a sunday school lesson
[1:11:00] because it's uh
[1:11:02] god help
[1:11:11] the word of me
[1:11:14] now look
[1:11:18] look at it right here
[1:11:20] if you're taking the notes and like i
[1:11:22] said i don't have the board a pair
[1:11:24] or a powerpoint but it's on um
[1:11:27] chapter 122
[1:11:29] in the uh spoken word
[1:11:32] of the original seed he says his word is
[1:11:35] his seed
[1:11:37] his spirit is the water
[1:11:41] he says now right to john 3 14. we
[1:11:44] getting it right from the scriptures i
[1:11:46] don't have it like the prophet saying
[1:11:48] i mean like the pastor said line right
[1:11:49] up with it he got a board up they could
[1:11:51] show you now you just got to write it
[1:11:53] down and go home and read it
[1:11:57] is that now look he said there you get
[1:11:59] it again
[1:12:01] you see the spirit lifts the water is
[1:12:05] the spirit is the water
[1:12:08] he says now look at john 3 14 we
[1:12:11] understand what it means
[1:12:13] he says as moses lifted up the brass
[1:12:16] serpent in the wilderness
[1:12:18] so must the son of man be lifted up
[1:12:22] that's why i said in the beginning
[1:12:24] if you do your homework you go to bring
[1:12:26] up beginning the hebrew
[1:12:29] translation of beginning is lifted up
[1:12:33] jesus came to lift up god
[1:12:36] he let them know he was worshiping he
[1:12:39] said i do nothing unless the father show
[1:12:41] it to me is that right
[1:12:43] in the name he said i come in my wife my
[1:12:46] father's name is that right
[1:12:49] so now in the name of jesus there's
[1:12:52] salvation in the name of jesus this
[1:12:56] healing in the name of jesus is his
[1:12:59] deliverance in the name of jesus
[1:13:02] so now we bring it that's the word is
[1:13:05] that right
[1:13:06] let me finish
[1:13:07] let me take my time
[1:13:09] i want you to see what the prophet was
[1:13:11] saying here
[1:13:12] it had to be something important
[1:13:14] he was showing him this was his purpose
[1:13:16] he believed this was the purpose he came
[1:13:18] here he had to battle those
[1:13:20] denominations those organizations
[1:13:22] and he he split this message up with two
[1:13:25] three hours on once in the first part
[1:13:27] and three hours on the second part
[1:13:31] he was getting the point you go you
[1:13:32] study this is so much i'm not even
[1:13:34] touching the surface of it he said you
[1:13:37] look
[1:13:38] he says now as moses lifted up the bad
[1:13:41] serpent in the wilderness so must the
[1:13:43] son of man be lifted up he said see if
[1:13:46] moses lifted up the brass serpent for
[1:13:49] the same cause christ was lifted up
[1:13:52] remember they was there in the
[1:13:53] wilderness and it was out there and they
[1:13:55] got the merman and complaining is that
[1:13:57] right you think the holy ghost don't
[1:13:59] tell us who mermaid ain't complaining
[1:14:01] you can marry me and complain you better
[1:14:02] stay away from that mixed multitude
[1:14:05] huh that was the mixed multitude that
[1:14:07] was with them that started murmuring and
[1:14:09] complaining trying to pull the righteous
[1:14:11] man away from their blessing telling
[1:14:13] them you don't need these mysteries and
[1:14:15] things and that like that huh
[1:14:17] then you know dig in it because there
[1:14:19] was a mixed multitude let me keep going
[1:14:22] he said now what is it moses lifted up
[1:14:25] the brass serpent
[1:14:27] and so that the people that was
[1:14:29] perishing might have water for life
[1:14:34] huh
[1:14:35] how did he get the breast serpent they
[1:14:37] knew moses had to do what they repented
[1:14:39] to moses is that right then moses went
[1:14:42] and prayed and when moses got there and
[1:14:44] prayed that water they'd have to what
[1:14:46] they needed a word is that right they
[1:14:49] had to have a word from the prophet when
[1:14:52] the word had to come from the prophet of
[1:14:54] god so we have to line it up with the
[1:14:57] scriptures so moses was that what he was
[1:15:00] the pastor to the world to the age at
[1:15:03] that time
[1:15:04] see william marion brandon is the pastor
[1:15:08] to this age is that right
[1:15:10] huh he's a pastor to this age but he's
[1:15:14] coming to show them that what christ was
[1:15:17] back on the scene is that right remember
[1:15:19] he was telling us what you're getting
[1:15:21] had to what you're getting had to come
[1:15:24] let me read this to you just just struck
[1:15:26] me
[1:15:27] amen it came of the resume this out of
[1:15:30] the resume
[1:15:33] of the church ages
[1:15:36] he said now look here god help me
[1:15:39] get over there and he says uh
[1:15:42] and for the sake of time
[1:15:44] so you can understand and those that are
[1:15:46] looking in and visitors you can
[1:15:48] understand we're not just lifting up a
[1:15:51] man he was the prophet that was sent to
[1:15:52] the age
[1:15:54] that's why the pastor tell you to go
[1:15:56] tell them about christ go out and tell
[1:15:58] them about the word go tell them about
[1:16:01] these hidden nuggets and then seed is
[1:16:03] going to ask you anyway is that right
[1:16:06] they gonna ask you then you let them
[1:16:08] know about malachi 4. luke 17 30.
[1:16:11] revelations 10 7. is that right
[1:16:14] he said now this age started just after
[1:16:16] the turn of the 20th century he says as
[1:16:19] it was beginning the age with the true
[1:16:22] church which turned being what the bride
[1:16:25] she was at pentecost she know that there
[1:16:28] must in the necessity be a return of the
[1:16:31] what of the dynamic power he's got to
[1:16:34] come he said the believer says this in
[1:16:37] their spirits and the believer see
[1:16:40] you're sensing it in your spirit
[1:16:43] he said if you sensing it in in their
[1:16:46] spirits begin crying to god for a new
[1:16:49] outpouring such as was in the first
[1:16:52] century
[1:16:54] bear with me now he said what seemed to
[1:16:56] be the answer such as was in the first
[1:16:59] he said came as many began to speak in
[1:17:02] tongues manifest the gifts of the spirit
[1:17:05] and it was believed that this was indeed
[1:17:08] the long-awaited restoration this is
[1:17:10] what they thought it was supposed to be
[1:17:14] but it wasn't is that right because the
[1:17:17] devil was still hiding in pentecost is
[1:17:20] that right
[1:17:21] so when you come up and sitting up in
[1:17:23] here you're trying to bring over
[1:17:26] where you come from but you i'm getting
[1:17:29] ready to read something to you you won't
[1:17:31] be able to hide that's why the pastor
[1:17:33] was saying sunday morning he's not
[1:17:36] rebuking you it's like the eagle stirs
[1:17:38] her nest he's shaking those loose leaves
[1:17:41] off of you is that right he glad now
[1:17:44] you're moving into the eagle food is
[1:17:46] that right you're moving it to the
[1:17:48] manifestation of the sons and the
[1:17:51] daughters of god this word is more
[1:17:53] powerful and this only word that can
[1:17:56] protect you from any kind of bomb that
[1:17:58] they make out there is that right hide
[1:18:01] me in the craft of the rock the cleft
[1:18:04] was the whole you're a new creature in
[1:18:06] christ jesus huh there's no condemnation
[1:18:10] that can come against you
[1:18:12] walk not after the flesh but after the
[1:18:14] spirit
[1:18:15] hallelujah
[1:18:17] look what he says he says now
[1:18:19] it was not it was not it was just
[1:18:22] restoration
[1:18:23] it was not the latter rain can come only
[1:18:27] after the former rain
[1:18:29] which is the spring or the what teaching

[1:18:52] sent to teach the people and turn the
[1:18:56] hearts of the children back to the
[1:18:58] pentecostal fathers

[1:30:30] huh
[1:30:33] spoken word
[1:30:35] huh
[1:30:36] cast them demons out of them pigs is
[1:30:40] that right by the what by the spoken
[1:30:43] word
[1:30:44] is that right all they wanted to hear
[1:30:46] was a word is that right
[1:30:49] they were too late for the rich young
[1:30:51] ruler right it was too late for him the
[1:30:54] word came to him is that right
[1:30:56] even the woman that was living ill fame
[1:30:59] that they wanted to stone her to death
[1:31:01] is that right they wanted a stone head
[1:31:03] of death and they knew they were coming
[1:31:05] up but they didn't know they was coming
[1:31:06] up against the world
[1:31:08] the anointed word eye for the day of
[1:31:12] this hour the supernatural anointed word
[1:31:16] for this hour here now god has brought
[1:31:18] in us and when they brought her they
[1:31:21] knew they were supposed to have a
[1:31:22] witness is that right the word can't
[1:31:25] offend the word
[1:31:27] so we got them they were supposed to
[1:31:29] bring a witness is that right but they
[1:31:31] missed it and jesus wrote in the same
[1:31:34] and said what he have not sinned do what
[1:31:36] cast the first stone when he looked up

[1:31:41] right
[1:31:42] they're going to be right there with

[1:31:46] ill-fating woman that was struggling in
[1:31:48] her life she brought him to eternal life
[1:31:52] and they walked away from eternal life
[1:31:54] is that right
[1:31:58] that just like ray had she was packing
[1:32:00] right what the spies needed is that
[1:32:03] right a woman prostitute living on the
[1:32:06] wall but she recognized that god was

[1:36:10] death lies in the what in the tongue is
[1:36:12] that right god hid these things from us
[1:36:15] so now saints do you have to realize the
[1:36:18] heart is changing the heart is that all
[1:36:20] you have to do is repent what is
[1:36:22] repentance someone out there tell them
[1:36:25] about the good news you say you just got
[1:36:27] to repent young lady you just got to
[1:36:29] turn to christ what is it to return from
[1:36:33] your ways
[1:36:34] it's a changed heart
[1:36:36] and a changed mind
[1:36:39] you no longer have a desire to do the
[1:36:41] things that you once did
[1:36:44] let us keep going help me lord
[1:36:47] he said now look he says wild verse he
[1:36:50] says verse 12 while i was with them now
[1:36:53] verse 13 he says and now come i thee and
[1:36:56] these things i speak in the world that
[1:36:58] they might have my one joy for in
[1:37:02] themselves i have given them thy what
[1:37:05] word
[1:37:06] and the world have hated them because
[1:37:09] they are not of the one of the world he
[1:37:12] says now look even as i am not of the
[1:37:14] world he says of glory he said i pray
[1:37:19] not that thou should take them out of
[1:37:21] the world but that thou should keep them
[1:37:25] from the what
[1:37:26] evil now if the spoken word
[1:37:30] walking in the flesh
[1:37:32] showed us as an example
[1:37:34] what he did
[1:37:36] now if someone in your family that's
[1:37:40] struggling with something you pray for
[1:37:42] them you keep them up in prayer because
[1:37:46] your prayer is just as powerful as jesus
[1:37:49] prayer the same prayer because you're
[1:37:52] becoming one you've got a father that's
[1:37:56] struggling you got a mother that's
[1:37:58] struggling you got a brother that's
[1:38:00] struggling your brother you got a child
[1:38:02] that's struggling you got a husband
[1:38:04] that's struggling hold him up in prayer
[1:38:07] jesus know that his prayer would be
[1:38:10] answered jesus no because he proved it
[1:38:13] and he testifying that your prayer
[1:38:16] was going to be answered and stand in
[1:38:18] the gap with someone you know why
[1:38:20] because you received the word they
[1:38:22] received the word they received the word
[1:38:28] he said now look
[1:38:30] look at verse 17 he says sanctify them
[1:38:34] through thy what truth thy word is truth
[1:38:37] let's drop down to 23 for the sake of
[1:38:39] time in them
[1:38:41] and thou in me
[1:38:43] that may be made what
[1:38:46] in what
[1:38:47] ah

[1:39:14] truly truly truly believe it the holy
[1:39:17] ghost would come down and anoint it is
[1:39:19] that right and what are the words and
[1:39:22] he'll unfold more and more to you
[1:39:24] let me keep going i'm trying to get to
[1:39:26] somewhere he says thou has sent me and
[1:39:29] has loved them as thou has loved me he
[1:39:32] said now look jesus was the seed jesus
[1:39:35] was the seed that eve had produced is
[1:39:38] that right that the eve should have
[1:39:40] produced that was the seed it was going
[1:39:43] to be that's why we say the spoken word
[1:39:46] was the original seed is that right
[1:39:48] let's turn it back to luke eight
[1:39:50] let me show you luca
[1:39:52] luke 8 and we're about to round it down
[1:39:56] because i know by the grace of god
[1:39:58] it's wednesday and we thank god for his
[1:40:00] grace
[1:40:01] and and and his mercy let me see where
[1:40:04] that was
[1:40:05] help me lord yeah luke
[1:40:08] 8 and i tell you what let's uh of course
[1:40:12] for the sake of time
[1:40:14] let's look at uh
[1:40:17] five first five i think it was
[1:40:20] well let's start at verse 4.
[1:40:23] he says now look help me lord
[1:40:27] he says
[1:40:29] and his disciples
[1:40:31] answered him from hints and the man said
[1:40:34] no i don't want to go there let's drop
[1:40:36] down to um
[1:40:39] 10.
[1:40:40] okay i'm in mark i'm sorry
[1:40:42] i'm in mark
[1:40:44] i'm in mark
[1:40:45] hallelujah
[1:40:47] okay
[1:40:50] here we go thank you jesus
[1:40:52] let's look at four he says and when and
[1:40:55] when much people were gathered together
[1:40:57] and would come to him out of every city
[1:41:00] and and musicians shouldn't come forth
[1:41:02] he said and much people were gathered
[1:41:05] together and would come to him out of
[1:41:07] every city he says he spake a parable he
[1:41:11] said the sower went out to sow the what
[1:41:14] the seed and as he sowed and fell upon
[1:41:16] the wayside and tried them down and the
[1:41:19] fowls of the air and devoured it he said
[1:41:22] now look now remember the prophet of god
[1:41:24] worked this here he was working it in
[1:41:26] the same message but he was just showing
[1:41:28] how the denominations and the
[1:41:29] organizations just come and steal the
[1:41:31] word out of it people trying to bring
[1:41:34] their organization thinking their
[1:41:37] organization teaching they're trying to
[1:41:39] bring it over until the unadulterated
[1:41:42] words it's not going to work that's
[1:41:44] right brother it's not it's not going to
[1:41:46] work and that's why i don't have time to
[1:41:48] go to all that you have to pull it up
[1:41:49] and and and look in it he was working
[1:41:52] and he was showing them this is what was
[1:41:54] taken from they was trying to bring the
[1:41:56] traditions in their ways and their
[1:41:57] teachings that's why jesus said you must
[1:42:00] have been what born again born of the
[1:42:02] water in the spirit and so the water in
[1:42:04] the spirit because why in the time now
[1:42:07] the first doctrine that he brought you
[1:42:09] is because it was only for the original
[1:42:11] seed the original seed is the only one
[1:42:14] that can be born again here you see
[1:42:16] hallelujah
[1:42:18] let's keep going he says now look at
[1:42:20] verse nine jump over here to verse nine
[1:42:23] he says and his disciples asked him said
[1:42:26] and said what might be this parable be
[1:42:29] he said and he said unto it it is given
[1:42:33] to know the what
[1:42:35] ah
[1:42:37] ah
[1:42:39] i thought the mysteries were just in the
[1:42:40] seven cells i thought the mission was
[1:42:42] just in the church
[1:42:48] huh why'd the prophet keep talking about
[1:42:50] the gospel why the brother branham
[1:42:52] always would bring the gospel the
[1:42:54] preaching of the cross it's foolishness
[1:42:56] to a man that powers but his power until
[1:42:58] a man is saved roll the blood roll the
[1:43:01] blood the blood of god has signed my
[1:43:03] name it can't be taken off god signed my
[1:43:07] name
[1:43:11] [Music]
[1:43:13] god said it
[1:43:15] let it be so
[1:43:17] the spoken word is the original seed of
[1:43:21] god we're getting back to the original
[1:43:25] [Music]
[1:43:29] the miracle he said all such faith jesus
[1:43:32] saw the faith even though he was not yet
[1:43:34] sent to the gentiles gentile but he's
[1:43:37] seen how great faith the gentiles had
[1:43:40] they would just receive the word because
[1:43:42] why because they recognized god was on
[1:43:45] the scene
[1:43:47] [Music]
[1:43:52] it was god
[1:43:56] came down
[1:43:57] in the body
[1:43:59] that's why you young ladies when you
[1:44:01] have a baby when the baby gets to be
[1:44:02] about six months
[1:44:04] and then to start moving
[1:44:06] start singing songs to that baby
[1:44:09] huh reading scriptures to that baby
[1:44:12] blaming that baby world of light
[1:44:16] talk to him
[1:44:17] because it hears
[1:44:19] and it'll calm down if you sing a good
[1:44:22] christian song to that baby it'll be
[1:44:25] comfort why because gee we have a high
[1:44:28] priest that cannot can be touched by the
[1:44:30] feelings of what our infirmities is that
[1:44:33] right he planted the seed the word seed
[1:44:37] and what was planted in mary is that
[1:44:40] right he knows everybody infirmities he
[1:44:43] knows what you go through having a child
[1:44:46] because he was inside of that body is
[1:44:48] that right
[1:44:49] jesus so let it be
[1:44:54] help me lord
[1:44:55] he said now look
[1:44:58] he said look
[1:45:00] he says unto you it is given to know the
[1:45:03] what
[1:45:03] the mysteries of the kingdom of god
[1:45:06] he says but to others in parables
[1:45:09] that seeing they what
[1:45:12] see not
[1:45:13] and the hearing that they might what
[1:45:17] you know brother branham said that was
[1:45:19] the mystery
[1:45:21] he said that mystery was the opening of
[1:45:23] that word
[1:45:24] it was the word they couldn't receive
[1:45:26] the word
[1:45:27] so he brought it to him in parables but
[1:45:30] you could receive the word
[1:45:32] now you see why the devil don't want you
[1:45:34] to get these mysteries
[1:45:36] huh the opening of this word
[1:45:39] and want to rush and say go home and say
[1:45:41] you don't need these things huh
[1:45:44] let me read god help me if i can
[1:45:48] i can read it to you what he said
[1:45:50] help me lord
[1:45:52] he said now
[1:45:59] help me jesus
[1:46:01] when he worked that he said that's the
[1:46:04] that was the mystery
[1:46:05] the mystery was then when the opening of
[1:46:08] the word came they couldn't receive it
[1:46:11] he says now the reproduction god help me
[1:46:14] he said he was he was that seed that eve
[1:46:17] should have produced he says he was the
[1:46:19] seed that he was
[1:46:20] produced but but the hybrid believing i
[1:46:23] read that already help me lord
[1:46:27] here's the word he says the word seed
[1:46:30] but god there is a germ life come from
[1:46:33] the real seed that god proved it was his
[1:46:37] seed
[1:46:38] he proved it was a seed when he what
[1:46:41] when he rose again out of that grave
[1:46:45] now in the resurrected christ he's
[1:46:47] living here again look what he says he
[1:46:50] says now unto you it is unto you
[1:46:55] it is given
[1:46:57] it's given
[1:46:58] it's given
[1:47:00] it's given to you
[1:47:02] to know the mysteries of the kingdom of
[1:47:04] god
[1:47:05] he said but to others it's parables that
[1:47:08] sin they might not see and hearing that
[1:47:10] they might not understand he says now
[1:47:13] the parable is this the seed is the what
[1:47:17] the word of god
[1:47:19] may the lord have a blessing to the
[1:47:20] reading of his word hallelujah let me

[1:51:42] you know
[1:51:43] brother branham was a professional
[1:51:48] very very professional
[1:51:51] to even try to preach
[1:51:53] the spoken word
[1:51:55] is the original seed
[1:51:58] in six hours
[1:52:01] do you know what brother branham spoke
[1:52:02] about the seals

[1:52:06] brother branham say if he preached one
[1:52:07] seal he will preach a three month
[1:52:11] so he preached it in one service
[1:52:14] so what is in there
[1:52:17] part one part two part three part four
[1:52:21] he said three months
[1:52:23] how many parts
[1:52:25] he he takes a message and preached six
[1:52:27] hours
[1:52:28] and brother kelly you want to jump into
[1:52:30] that
[1:52:34] hallelujah
[1:52:35] you're going to be shooting everywhere
[1:52:38] because of the the the material that is
[1:52:41] in there it is so rich
[1:52:44] so powerful
[1:52:46] amen
[1:52:47] that you can barely touch the surface
[1:52:50] of what the prophet was trying to really
[1:52:52] bring out
[1:52:54] amen
[1:52:55] my god my god
[1:52:58] [Laughter]
[1:53:01] this word is something let's just stand
[1:53:04] let's stand
[1:53:05] before i get into something
[1:53:08] amen
[1:53:09] do you know when they say when god says
[1:53:11] something it doesn't change do you know
[1:53:13] what i mean
[1:53:15] do you know what i mean
[1:53:17] when they say when god says something
[1:53:19] it will be eternally true do you know
[1:53:21] why
[1:53:23] you know why
[1:53:24] right how many knows
[1:53:28] okay
[1:53:30] do you know why
[1:53:37] we call this eternity
[1:53:39] right
[1:53:41] amen
[1:53:44] eternity is like a circle
[1:53:46] you don't know where he start
[1:53:49] you don't know where he stopped
[1:53:51] it is like a ring
[1:53:52] he keep going eternity eternity and god
[1:53:57] and eternity blended together
[1:54:00] so when you look at god and eternity
[1:54:02] they are confused
[1:54:05] amen
[1:54:06] you don't know what is the beginning
[1:54:08] what is the end because melchizedek have
[1:54:10] no father no mother know what
[1:54:14] nor even water
[1:54:16] so when you look it's just you don't
[1:54:18] know where to start
[1:54:20] how can this man get that
[1:54:23] amen
[1:54:24] how can this man get that so inside this
[1:54:28] state that we call eternity
[1:54:31] this is where god program everything
[1:54:34] this is where god says
[1:54:36] brother rabbit
[1:54:39] amen
[1:54:40] will be married
[1:54:43] to
[1:54:43] [Music]
[1:54:45] sister lauren he gave that answer quick
[1:54:48] amen
[1:54:50] so when god says this
[1:54:53] he spoke this in eternity
[1:54:57] make sense
[1:54:58] so god before he comes up with this
[1:55:01] decision
[1:55:03] do you get it
[1:55:05] god search all eternity
[1:55:08] to see
[1:55:09] what is
[1:55:11] the problem
[1:55:13] that can block
[1:55:14] brother robert
[1:55:16] from getting married to sister laurel
[1:55:22] in eternity
[1:55:24] not in time
[1:55:27] does it make sense
[1:55:28] so in eternity god already searched and
[1:55:32] he searched his search and he programmed
[1:55:35] everything in eternity when he finished
[1:55:38] he seals the book
[1:55:41] and he take his stamp and he put it and
[1:55:43] he say but robert life is finished
[1:55:47] put it there on the shelf who's next
[1:55:50] [Music]
[1:55:52] is he helping you
[1:55:54] is he helping you
[1:55:56] why are you surprised about what
[1:55:57] happened to you
[1:56:00] why are you surprised do you want me to
[1:56:02] continue
[1:56:04] [Laughter]
[1:56:06] when he finished those decisions
[1:56:09] then god shrank
[1:56:12] make sense when he shrank he shrank into
[1:56:16] a pillar of fire
[1:56:18] right
[1:56:19] because there was no space
[1:56:21] eternity is just
[1:56:23] blocking him so he has to shrink
[1:56:26] now
[1:56:27] is left
[1:56:29] now he's god he can float now
[1:56:32] on eternity
[1:56:33] he's the pillar of fire
[1:56:35] right
[1:56:36] you remember when he did this he created
[1:56:39] a negative pressure
[1:56:42] which we call emptiness
[1:56:44] all right
[1:56:46] all right if you take this circle right
[1:56:48] here
[1:56:49] i hope you're getting it
[1:56:51] if you take this circle right here
[1:56:53] and you stretch it straight
[1:56:57] do you hear me
[1:56:59] did i lose somebody
[1:57:04] if you up if you break the circle here
[1:57:08] and you stretch it and you stretch it
[1:57:11] and you put it in a line
[1:57:14] do you hear me
[1:57:18] it becomes like this
[1:57:21] okay
[1:57:22] this is what science call
[1:57:28] negative
[1:57:31] two
[1:57:35] we okay
[1:57:36] now we okay now
[1:57:39] now this circle is stretched
[1:57:42] make sense
[1:57:43] okay
[1:57:44] then this
[1:57:48] negative pressure here
[1:57:50] okay if you want to put it on this line
[1:57:54] what it does
[1:57:56] it does a loop
[1:58:00] like this
[1:58:06] this loop
[1:58:07] is a negative
[1:58:09] loop where we call
[1:58:11] time
[1:58:15] make sense
[1:58:17] make sense
[1:58:18] okay
[1:58:19] so everything that we are here
[1:58:22] is ready
[1:58:26] everything
[1:58:27] that happened to you here your birth
[1:58:29] you're growing you're going to school
[1:58:31] everything is happening here about here
[1:58:34] you remember brother chad sermon
[1:58:37] and brother branham say one of this day
[1:58:39] when we finish god will take this loop
[1:58:42] and pull the rub back up
[1:58:44] and then we back again too
[1:58:48] do you see what happened
[1:58:50] but your decision here
[1:58:53] was not taken here
[1:58:57] okay
[1:58:58] your decision was taken here
[1:59:04] okay
[1:59:05] so when god said brother rabbit will get
[1:59:08] married to sister gloria he was in
[1:59:11] eternity
[1:59:13] right
[1:59:14] so when god take this decision and bring
[1:59:18] it here
[1:59:19] god cannot change
[1:59:22] this one is 1949 1946
[1:59:26] 1950 2001 2003 it have nothing to do
[1:59:31] with this
[1:59:34] so god cannot bring a new decision
[1:59:38] because this is like a perversion
[1:59:41] right
[1:59:42] his decision was taken in perfection
[1:59:47] so god cannot bring something
[1:59:50] if something is already perfect what
[1:59:53] else can you do to that which is perfect
[1:59:57] what else
[1:59:59] it's something that is not perfect that
[2:00:01] you're trying to make perfect but the
[2:00:03] decision of god was taken when he was
[2:00:06] perfect
[2:00:08] amen
[2:00:09] that's why god when he spoke he doesn't
[2:00:12] change anything
[2:00:14] when he spoke
[2:00:16] his word is spoken in eternity
[2:00:20] eternity means he already looked at
[2:00:23] everything the whole story
[2:00:26] so when brother robert enter here in
[2:00:29] time
[2:00:32] okay
[2:00:33] you can take brother robert and put him
[2:00:36] in australia
[2:00:41] you can take sister royal you get her
[2:00:43] way way way down in south america
[2:00:47] amen
[2:00:49] this condition here
[2:00:51] have no obstacle to eternity
[2:00:58] hallelujah
[2:00:59] hallelujah
[2:01:00] so it's just a matter of time
[2:01:05] anybody here
[2:01:06] when the time of marriage come
[2:01:10] even if there is corona virus
[2:01:16] even if they close their borders
[2:01:20] are you there
[2:01:21] the laws of nature will give away
[2:01:25] that this decision
[2:01:27] will always have to happen
[2:01:32] are you there
[2:01:34] god will open up a certain way for
[2:01:36] sister royal to meet brother robert
[2:01:38] somehow
[2:01:43] are you there
[2:01:44] that's why when god said something
[2:01:48] you
[2:01:49] catch it
[2:01:51] amen
[2:01:52] because it would not change
[2:01:54] that's why he said heaven and earth
[2:01:56] shall not pass away
[2:01:59] but this word here whatever i have in my
[2:02:02] mind when he spoke before he spoke he's
[2:02:05] gonna look he say what is brother robert
[2:02:08] problem but robert problem is gonna be
[2:02:10] this
[2:02:12] one two three he said okay if it's gonna
[2:02:15] be one two three i need to give him
[2:02:18] something stronger than three but the
[2:02:20] robert is gonna made in caliber five
[2:02:25] then he sent brother rabbit
[2:02:28] so when brother robert come to the world
[2:02:30] when you put one he just knock it
[2:02:34] that's why he cannot give you any
[2:02:37] trial
[2:02:38] beyond
[2:02:39] your caliber
[2:02:44] that caliber was already measured
[2:02:50] it was measured in eternity
[2:02:54] so when you're coming if there is an
[2:02:56] obstacle your caliber is different than
[2:02:59] brother evil caliber
[2:03:02] and you gonna knock it down
[2:03:04] even though you feel like this is too
[2:03:06] much it is not too much
[2:03:08] he cannot put something in you without
[2:03:11] you being able to knock at him
[2:03:19] amen
[2:03:20] that is why the word the word the word
[2:03:24] the word is important
[2:03:26] and god created the world by them
[2:03:33] if god spoke
[2:03:36] who can stop him
[2:03:38] amen
[2:03:40] who can stop him do you know what he was
[2:03:42] trying to do to the
[2:03:43] uh roman centurion
[2:03:47] do you know
[2:03:48] he wanted to go lay hand
[2:03:51] right
[2:03:52] right
[2:03:53] the laying on hand
[2:03:57] delaying on hand i'm going to let you go
[2:03:58] home he's a jewish faith
[2:04:01] [Music]
[2:04:04] amen
[2:04:05] he was trying to get a jewish faith
[2:04:08] and pull it introduce it to the gentler
[2:04:12] and they don't say stop
[2:04:16] you're forgetting something
[2:04:18] you're forgetting something
[2:04:21] over there they need to touch your hand
[2:04:24] they need to touch your clothes
[2:04:26] the hem of your garment we don't need
[2:04:29] those things
[2:04:33] we just need though
[2:04:44] we are interested in
[2:04:51] because we understand authority
[2:04:54] authority doesn't lie on touching
[2:04:57] clothes
[2:04:58] he doesn't lie on laying hand
[2:05:01] he lies in there
[2:05:07] that's why jesus said ouch
[2:05:10] i remember i remember
[2:05:13] this kind of thing is not in israel
[2:05:24] what is the purpose of the message then
[2:05:28] you got your answer
[2:05:30] is the message complicated
[2:05:32] if i continue we're going to stay here
[2:05:34] longer
[2:05:37] when he mentioned about the the the the
[2:05:40] woman that was caught in adultery what
[2:05:42] brought that woman to jesus
[2:05:46] have you thought about it
[2:05:49] can i give you homework
[2:05:51] what brought her to jesus do you know
[2:05:52] what brought her to jesus
[2:05:59] somebody will say it's
[2:06:00] adultery correct
[2:06:02] can i help you with something else
[2:06:05] open galatian 3
[2:06:09] sorry my brother
[2:06:11] you the one causing all of this
[2:06:19] you heard brother sam
[2:06:21] in other words blaming on me
[2:06:24] galatians 3
[2:06:25] 24.
[2:06:28] sorry brother kelly you started
[2:06:33] you see that
[2:06:35] did you see galatian 3
[2:06:37] do you see 24
[2:06:39] can somebody read it
[2:06:42] the lord did what
[2:06:44] wherefore the law was what
[2:06:48] to do what
[2:06:50] to what
[2:06:53] let me stop who brought the woman to
[2:06:55] christ
[2:07:02] they bought her based on water
[2:07:08] and they didn't know that the law was
[2:07:09] made to bring us to who
[2:07:12] and when they bring the predestinated
[2:07:13] say to christ what does christ do
[2:07:22] you thought you're gonna corner me
[2:07:29] see how the devil thought he caught you
[2:07:31] in sin
[2:07:33] [Music]
[2:07:36] born in sin shaping iniquity coming into
[2:07:40] the world
[2:07:41] speaking lies
[2:07:43] down low
[2:07:44] the ordinance that was condemning you
[2:07:52] that the devil keep reminding you
[2:07:55] of you remember what you did in 1949 you
[2:07:58] remember what you did in 1950 you
[2:08:00] remember what you did in 2000
[2:08:02] it was that that brought you
[2:08:05] [Music]
[2:08:08] and when you come to christ with that
[2:08:10] condition you make christ more potent
[2:08:16] because jesus christ said the sick
[2:08:19] only search for the doctor
[2:08:21] if you are not sick his medication
[2:08:23] doesn't work good
[2:08:24] because you're healthy so the more sick
[2:08:27] you are the more powerful you can sense
[2:08:30] his medication
[2:08:32] and when you sense his medication you
[2:08:34] say ah that medication really really
[2:08:38] work
[2:08:39] and you can tell somebody if they got
[2:08:41] sick you said go to that doctor
[2:08:44] i remember the prescription he gave me
[2:08:46] that prescription really really working
[2:08:49] me
