[36:55] so you just pray with us i was out there
[36:58] in the grave
[36:58] through my notes and i grabbed the wrong
[37:00] note so i don't know what he's gonna
[37:02] preach tonight either is that right
[37:04] i'm just gonna get out the way and let
[37:05] him have his way because what i wanted
[37:08] to bring god already knew he wanted me
[37:10] to leave at home
[37:11] so i guess this is what he wanted to
[37:12] have tonight right
[37:14] hallelujah let's go to romans chapter
[37:17] eight
[37:19] i'll tell you i was going to work with
[37:22] the predestinated ones
[37:24] you know but here's the lord will
[37:28] see what he has hallelujah
[37:31] romans 8 verse 29 you have to say amen
[37:36] he said for whom he did for anew he also
[37:40] did predestinated to be conformed to the
[37:43] image of his son
[37:44] that he might be the firstborn among
[37:47] many brethren
[37:48] moreover who he did predestinate them he
[37:52] also called
[37:53] and whom he called them he also
[37:55] justified
[37:57] and to whom he justified them he also
[37:59] glorified
[38:01] he says and and what shall we we then
[38:04] say to these things it's god before us
[38:08] who can be against us may the lord have
[38:11] a blessing to the reading of his word
[38:13] and you may uh let's go over to um
[38:16] joshua
[38:22] hallelujah
[38:30] and joshua 1
[38:34] and we verse 6
[38:38] be strong and of good courage for unto
[38:41] this people shall
[38:42] thou divide for an inheritance the land
[38:45] which i swear unto their fathers
[38:47] to give them you may be seated
[38:50] amen we're looking here
[38:54] let's look at we're going to look at
[38:56] joshua by the grace of god
[38:58] you know we gotta listen to a thought
[39:01] and
[39:02] we got the inspiration of you know a
[39:05] hidden
[39:05] place a hidden life i want to look in
[39:09] there
[39:10] you know in that message when brother
[39:11] branham he was working
[39:13] with that a hidden light it was short
[39:16] but it was loaded
[39:17] and the thing that just kept striking my
[39:20] spirit
[39:20] was us being being tutored
[39:24] you know when he talked about the one
[39:26] there been intruded but he also
[39:29] was talking about that hidden life you
[39:31] know being justification sanctification
[39:34] in the baptism of the holy ghost but we
[39:36] know we want to move behind the veil
[39:38] is that right you know that's the age
[39:41] and that's the time that we're in now
[39:44] so we will you know spend that time so
[39:46] we have
[39:47] so much trouble and all of our trouble
[39:49] is not just because
[39:50] of the devil i'll just say that god is
[39:54] allowing it but god is allowing these
[39:56] things so that we can
[39:57] become stronger and be prepared for
[40:00] what's coming ahead is that right
[40:02] because the last time was here we was
[40:04] working with the baptism
[40:05] or the other holy ghost is that right it
[40:08] was telling that we know that the holy
[40:10] ghost
[40:10] is god's own life it's zoe it's the
[40:13] spirit of god
[40:15] that is dwelling inside of his children
[40:17] is that right
[40:18] but we know that the holy spirit is
[40:20] moving and that's why we were showing
[40:22] them the last thing that we
[40:24] that we read to you i was going to read
[40:26] to you some more because we were talking
[40:28] about the justification
[40:29] the sanctification and the baptism of
[40:31] the holy ghost
[40:32] but then we wanted to move into the
[40:34] adoption is that right
[40:36] and to make a way for the person himself
[40:38] and that's
[40:39] what we're moving into because when god
[40:42] is coming we may not appear to be
[40:44] nothing
[40:44] but when god come we're going to be just
[40:47] like him is that right
[40:48] so we have to understand now during this
[40:51] time being
[40:52] being moving we're moving into a
[40:54] position and i tell you when brother
[40:56] branham worked that lesson you need to
[40:58] go back
[40:58] and really really study it i've been
[41:00] studying it because i tell you
[41:02] it's major to where the holy spirit has
[41:04] the pastor right now
[41:06] and you know when we're moving into the
[41:08] because a person has to understand
[41:10] before you can move into that position
[41:13] under the adoption is that right it has
[41:16] to be a character there
[41:17] it has to be the person himself to be
[41:20] able to say
[41:21] he mean we want to use you and he's
[41:24] going to tell you to go pray
[41:25] for joe blow so that the limbs can come
[41:28] back and so this can go back
[41:30] but you have to be now disciplined it's
[41:32] got to be the true genuine
[41:34] holy ghost down inside of you god is
[41:37] getting us ready for this here now
[41:40] so we have to understand the last time
[41:42] that we was here
[41:43] remember the holy ghost is also a seal
[41:46] but it's a
[41:47] but it cannot seal you if something is
[41:50] loose is that right
[41:51] so we have to understand that's why we
[41:53] want to look at this
[41:54] joshua ministry we just come to
[41:56] encourage you along the way
[41:58] but we know in the old testament they
[42:00] had a tutor is that right
[42:02] and the tutor was intruded for us was a
[42:04] school master
[42:05] we know it was the law and that was the
[42:08] school master
[42:09] until that that the fullness had come
[42:11] was coming is that right
[42:13] so now we know we're no longer on the
[42:16] law but we're under grace is that right
[42:18] so we're in them by the grace of god and
[42:20] that's what the holy spirit was sharing
[42:22] with us there
[42:23] on sunday he says it's the lust of our
[42:26] eye it's the lust of the flesh
[42:27] and it's the pride of life so we have to
[42:30] understand i tell you
[42:32] i'm gonna share my testimony too i'm
[42:34] excited i'm standing up here
[42:35] because if you would have known the
[42:37] condition that i was in i tell you about
[42:39] a week and a half ago
[42:41] i tell you the devil came in but the
[42:43] lord said when the enemy killed me like
[42:45] the flood i would lift up a mighty
[42:47] standard against
[42:48] it so you have to learn to fight that in
[42:51] the war you're in a war
[42:52] and you got to learn to fight this war
[42:54] you know you know where he was growing
[42:56] up we used to like
[42:57] prize fighting you know you got to
[42:59] understand your enemy you got to
[43:00] understand you got
[43:01] 200 million demons loose in this hour
[43:04] here now
[43:05] so we wrestle not against flesh and
[43:07] blood but against principalities and
[43:09] powers
[43:09] and wickedness and rules in high places
[43:12] so you have to understand you know
[43:14] paul's
[43:14] paul was saying he said the things i
[43:17] desired to do
[43:18] i did not the things i desired not to do
[43:20] i did
[43:21] but i found it was a war among me a
[43:23] world war in my memories award my what
[43:26] in my mind is that right that's why god
[43:29] said
[43:29] cast on every imagination that came and
[43:32] tried to exhort himself
[43:33] up against the hand of god is that right
[43:36] because you got to
[43:37] understand your opponent you know when
[43:39] you got around and then wasn't there any
[43:41] other minimum having that lead
[43:42] you know what i was back in my time you
[43:44] know i know some of y'all made it in but
[43:45] anyway
[43:46] back there you know he understood his
[43:48] opponent is that right
[43:50] he always understood them but you know
[43:52] when he got around that he knew
[43:54] that's why he could put on the show and
[43:55] he could he could predict a
[43:57] certain time he would knock him out and
[43:59] what he was going to do is that right
[44:01] but he had he always had problems with
[44:03] who he had problems with joe frazier is
[44:06] that right
[44:06] because when he fought smoking joe he
[44:09] got a realizer
[44:10] because you know when you're like prized
[44:12] fighting you know when you're gonna hit
[44:13] a man with a jab
[44:14] if you can hit a man with a jab you can
[44:16] hit him anytime is that right
[44:18] you pop him and you can hit him but what
[44:20] he was doing was wearing that neck down
[44:22] wearing that neck down wearing that neck
[44:24] down but you know down there
[44:26] but when it came to smoking joe smoking
[44:28] joe always kept moving at him like this
[44:31] is that right so ali had to trade
[44:33] different alley had to train to throw
[44:35] 115
[44:36] to 120 punches around he's tired when he
[44:39] came up against joe
[44:40] now you're in laird to see her you can't
[44:42] get slack on your prayer life
[44:44] you can't get slack or read your bible
[44:46] you can't get slack on fasting
[44:48] you can't get slack on these things you
[44:50] got 200 million demons
[44:52] loose out there you got to understand
[44:54] the times that you're living in
[44:56] hallelujah
[45:00] help us lord he said look
[45:06] we're living in these perilous times but
[45:08] you have to understand
[45:10] you got a tutor and the tutor is
[45:12] watching over
[45:14] and the two always go back and report
[45:16] back to the father
[45:17] don't think you're getting away with
[45:19] anything
[45:22] the holy ghost goes and report and tell
[45:24] them right
[45:25] it's a good child when they got a bad
[45:28] child you know
[45:29] sometimes people want to try to pacify
[45:31] him but he's not going to pacify him
[45:33] that's why you thank god you got a
[45:34] pastor that love you you know why
[45:37] not so much because what god is doing
[45:39] through him but he'll correct you
[45:41] ah that's when you know you got somebody
[45:44] that loves you
[45:45] is that right because love is corrective
[45:47] so we have to understand
[45:49] it is our here and now man when that
[45:51] tutor that tutor goes back and he
[45:53] reports
[45:54] to the father he tell them maybe perhaps
[45:57] you're having trouble over there in your
[45:59] flesh it's because when i told you to go
[46:02] fast
[46:03] you're not fasting yet he's not fasting
[46:06] yet
[46:06] so he go back and tell the father no
[46:09] he's not fast enough yet father
[46:11] but then he told this one over here yes
[46:13] father when i wake him up in the morning
[46:16] and get up and pray about two or three
[46:18] in the morning lord god uh
[46:20] when someone needs prayer when someone
[46:22] needs someone to visit
[46:24] or someone needs a phone call they're
[46:26] being obedient is that right
[46:28] the holy ghost comes up and the holy
[46:30] ghost comes and it tells the father
[46:32] it goes back and reports to the father
[46:35] so the tutor is there
[46:36] and when the tutors now see that you're
[46:38] ready then you're a good
[46:40] child and your report and you gave in a
[46:43] good report
[46:44] and then the holy ghost says damn i
[46:47] could do what movement to the what
[46:49] the adoption is that right there i think
[46:52] we can move them into the adoption
[46:55] that's why you have to understand this
[46:57] flesh uh there's no good thing in the
[46:59] flesh
[47:00] the flesh the five see taste feel smell
[47:03] and hear was only sent to contact your
[47:06] earthly body is that right
[47:08] that's all they were said to do to
[47:09] contact this earthly body
[47:11] but you have to understand memory reason
[47:14] and conscient affection
[47:16] those and then what those are sent to
[47:18] contact you what your spirit is that
[47:20] right
[47:20] that puts you on free more well with god
[47:24] so when the enemy comes in it's left up
[47:26] to you if you're going to receive it or
[47:28] not
[47:28] is that right god puts you on free will
[47:31] so that's why you say
[47:33] meditate he said meditate on the word of
[47:35] god what
[47:36] day and night is that right now so when
[47:39] you're coming in now when the holy ghost
[47:41] now comes and you become what you'll be
[47:44] coming that's
[47:45] what to the position i mean that
[47:46] position is now the adoption
[47:49] when you're adopting the adoption now
[47:51] have put you in a position
[47:53] you are put in your position in your
[47:56] position maybe you're just
[47:58] you're you're sent to be a beautiful
[48:00] housewife is that right
[48:02] be the best housewife that god has moved
[48:04] you into your position
[48:06] god have chosen you to be maybe you are
[48:09] a nurse
[48:10] you are the best nurse that god chose
[48:13] you to be
[48:14] because now you have been put in your
[48:16] position
[48:17] is that right god has chosen you i mean
[48:20] you are preordained
[48:22] you are ordained for your position and
[48:24] so
[48:25] maybe god have chosen you to be a beacon
[48:28] be the best deacon
[48:29] that you can be if god have chosen you
[48:32] to be a trustee you can be your
[48:34] best trustee that you can be is that
[48:37] right
[48:38] if god has sent you a good husband
[48:41] you'll be the best wife that you can be
[48:43] and the husbands you can be the best
[48:46] husband
[48:46] that you can be you are now moved from
[48:49] this side of the holy ghost
[48:51] but you are now being moved into your
[48:53] position
[48:54] is that right
[48:59] look what he says hallelujah let's look
[49:03] at joshua
[49:04] joshua 1. he says now after the death of
[49:08] moses
[49:09] the servant of the lord came to pass
[49:11] that the lord spake unto joshua the son
[49:14] of none moses
[49:15] minister saying moses my servant is dead
[49:18] now therefore arise go over

[49:32] that the soul of your soul shall tread
[49:34] upon that have i given
[49:36] given unto you as i said unto moses
[49:39] for the wilderness and this lebanon even
[49:43] until the great river euphrates
[49:45] and the land of the hittites and to the
[49:47] great sea towards the going down of the
[49:49] sun
[49:50] shall be your coast he says there shall
[49:52] not
[49:53] any man be able to stand before thee all
[49:56] the days of thy life

[54:19] this is christ unfolding the word in the
[54:22] hour
[54:22] that we've been waiting on is that right
[54:25] that's why what paul was saying
[54:27] the things i desired to do i did not
[54:29] there was a war
[54:30] going on in my mind you don't have to
[54:32] get caught up in the spirit
[54:34] don't let satan plant seeds in your mind
[54:37] meditate on the word
[54:39] day and night is that right trust in the
[54:41] lord in all thy ways
[54:43] and lean not to thy own understanding
[54:46] and he will leave
[54:47] and he will guide and he will direct
[54:49] that path
[54:50] and you will never fault is that right
[54:52] he said put on what
[54:53] the whole armor of god and for so that
[54:56] you may be able to do what
[54:58] stand against all the wiles of the devil
[55:01] in these end times is that right
[55:03] we thank the lord i'm looking at some
[55:05] i'm thinking they're going to
[55:06] die saying the prophet's name i'm saying
[55:09] lord where are they going
[55:11] huh what they trying to do they think
[55:15] they got their own some type of
[55:16] revelation
[55:18] huh no way

[55:24] want to go behind the veil
[55:26] is that right you don't want to go
[55:27] behind the veil so sweet
[55:30] it's been so sweet when they tell you
[55:32] about it you want to go behind there
[55:34] little brother brandon said that he had
[55:36] a hidden life
[55:38] he said what you got to do you coming in
[55:40] justification
[55:41] coming in sanctification he said you got
[55:44] to get along
[55:45] first and just get some quiet time he
[55:47] said after you get alone
[55:49] and you get some quiet time just quiet
[55:51] time
[55:52] he said then you got to go you pray and
[55:54] after you get around and then you pray
[55:56] and you pray and the holy spirit will
[55:59] come and then he'll minister to you
[56:01] is that right and then after they come
[56:03] in and minister to you
[56:04] and then when you get in there you
[56:05] invite them into study
[56:07] and when you invite them into study it's
[56:09] just like that veil just dropping behind
[56:11] you
[56:12] ah and then they come down there and
[56:15] he'll meet you
[56:16] and he'll tell you exactly what he wants
[56:18] you to say to his precious children
[56:21] is that right you're gonna feed my sheep
[56:23] uh he knew what we was gonna need
[56:25] tonight
[56:26] because i didn't is that right
[56:28] hallelujah
[56:29] look what he said joshua hallelujah
[56:32] thank you jesus thank you lord he said
[56:35] but now
[56:36] and be strong and very courageous
[56:38] confident

[56:41] according to all the law
[56:43] that moses my servant commanded thee
[56:46] turn not from to the right hand or to
[56:48] the left and verse
[56:50] 8 this book of the law shall not depart
[56:54] out of the mouth but thou shalt meditate
[56:57] therein day
[56:58] and night he says that thou mayest
[57:00] observe
[57:01] to do according to all that is written
[57:04] therein
[57:05] see he'll come and say oh god my
[57:08] precious sister over here
[57:09] this angel and when the holy spirit go
[57:12] back and report
[57:13] back to the father and he's got a good
[57:15] report
[57:16] when the tutor tells them that she's
[57:18] meditating on the word
[57:20] day and night though and they get around
[57:22] and then
[57:23] god knows she's getting close she's
[57:25] falling in love with jesus
[57:27] and when you're falling in love with
[57:29] jesus he's an intimate relationship
[57:32] he'll just come in and start opening
[57:34] that word up to you saints
[57:36] i'm telling you we're moving into
[57:38] something that they
[57:40] have that it's not even for them i say
[57:42] this here if it wasn't for that kovic
[57:46] they better thank the lord
[57:49] because we probably wouldn't even be
[57:50] live streaming and some of them wouldn't
[57:51] even really know what we get what we're
[57:53] receiving
[57:57] i'm telling you this is fresh from the
[57:59] throne of god
[58:04] hallelujah this is no man what he's
[58:07] given the pastor
[58:09] god is bringing this fresh they've been
[58:11] waiting this was
[58:13] hidden manna that's right brother robert
[58:17] that's exactly what it is there was a
[58:20] hidden manner
[58:22] they can't understand it it's not for
[58:24] them to understand
[58:26] is that right that's why paul started
[58:28] talking about the adoption
[58:30] that's why paul started talking about
[58:32] moving into into those things see the
[58:35] of the eye the lust of the flesh and the
[58:36] pride of life is that right
[58:38] the god knows you know the enemy is
[58:40] going to come at you in those three ways
[58:42] i'll rescue recognize how the holy
[58:44] spirit just drilled that
[58:46] in that way is that right sunday he
[58:48] wouldn't let him get away from
[58:50] it because you have to understand is
[58:52] that right we're looking for the body
[58:54] change
[58:54] we know that we're going to have a body
[58:56] change we know that we're going to have
[58:58] issues in this flesh on this side here
[59:01] and now we know that we're going to go
[59:03] through things but you don't have to
[59:04] claim it is that right
[59:06] i'm not going to sit there and say i
[59:08] thank god for this
[59:09] uh uh code that's trying to get on my
[59:12] back or whatever
[59:13] no i'm going to say god once i recognize
[59:16] what i did to allow the enemy to get up
[59:18] on me
[59:19] i say father thank you for your mercy
[59:22] thank you for your grace lord god thank
[59:25] you lord god for
[59:27] being able to see me through this lord
[59:29] give me strength father
[59:31] let me recognize lord god that you're
[59:34] going to get glory out of this situation
[59:36] as you want to get glory out of someone
[59:38] with the virus
[59:39] why because once you receive the baptism
[59:42] of
[59:42] the holy ghost he said grieve not the
[59:44] holy spirit of god
[59:46] to read by you and what sealed until the
[59:49] day of your redemption
[59:50] is that right sure you're going to make
[59:52] mistakes but paul talked about it
[59:54] over there in the ephesus is that right
[59:56] he says our sins
[59:58] doesn't mean that since god doesn't
[1:00:00] condemn a sinner
[1:00:02] a sinner he's a sinner is that right
[1:00:05] he could do that because we sin but
[1:00:08] god also know that he already shed the
[1:00:11] bread blood when
[1:00:13] before the what foundation of the world
[1:00:16] is that right god knew the devil thought
[1:00:20] he had some of us as hormones but god
[1:00:23] slew the blood
[1:00:24] again before the foundation of the world
[1:00:28] god said he knew he was going to have
[1:00:30] some alcoholics the devil thought he was
[1:00:32] going to give us
[1:00:33] but god knew he was going to slew the
[1:00:36] lamb of god
[1:00:37] before the foundation of the world god
[1:00:40] know he was going to have
[1:00:41] some drug dealers but he slew the lamb
[1:00:44] of god
[1:00:45] before the foundation of the whale god
[1:00:48] knew
[1:00:49] he was going to have some hormone with
[1:00:51] but he slew
[1:00:52] the lamb of god before the foundation of
[1:00:55] the world
[1:00:56] god knew he was gonna have some
[1:00:58] murderers but he flew
[1:00:59] the lamb of god before the foundation
[1:01:02] of the world god knew he was gonna have
[1:01:05] some liars
[1:01:06] but he slew the lamb of god before the
[1:01:09] foundation of the world
[1:01:11] so when you send all the blame all the
[1:01:14] blood
[1:01:15] all the blood and sign my name
[1:01:28] according to all that is written there
[1:01:31] is for them

[1:15:32] i've got to keep you strong but paul was
[1:15:34] talking about this here
[1:15:36] i'm just going to touch a little bit of
[1:15:38] it here because it comes to me
[1:15:41] any adoption
[1:15:44] look at ephesians 1 and verse 3. it says
[1:15:47] blessed be the god and father of our
[1:15:49] lord jesus christ
[1:15:51] who have blessed us with all spiritual
[1:15:53] blessings
[1:15:54] in the heavenly places in christ it says
[1:15:57] according as he has what
[1:15:59] chosen us in him when before the
[1:16:01] foundation of the world
[1:16:03] that we should be holy and without blame
[1:16:06] before him we're in love see
[1:16:09] having predestinated means you have been
[1:16:12] ordained
[1:16:14] pre-ordained you cannot get
[1:16:17] out of this what god has called us to do
[1:16:20] i am now using that the word
[1:16:22] predestination with
[1:16:24] understanding i recognize noun that the
[1:16:28] devil knows
[1:16:29] that he's in trouble that's why god said
[1:16:31] that's why the prophet of god
[1:16:33] says if you once the bride who
[1:16:35] recognizes
[1:16:36] who she is she is really going to become
[1:16:39] that invincible army is that right we
[1:16:42] are coming in here now this body here
[1:16:45] now
[1:16:45] is just waiting to be what claimed is
[1:16:48] that right
[1:16:49] but god has to train you he has to bring
[1:16:52] you
[1:16:52] into a position into your to unto your
[1:16:55] position
[1:16:56] so you can understand what god has
[1:16:58] called you to do
[1:17:00] and when that god has called you to do
[1:17:02] we all are prayer warriors
[1:17:04] but god is going to use us in special
[1:17:06] ways saints
[1:17:08] we have to desire to for those souls one
[1:17:11] to be saved out there i even heard
[1:17:13] brother branham when he went to win on
[1:17:15] the other side
[1:17:16] and he saw those converts and he was
[1:17:18] wondering who they were
[1:17:19] and it was about it looked like a
[1:17:21] million converts and when he saw those
[1:17:23] converses the
[1:17:24] converts they were young and they were
[1:17:27] young and beautiful
[1:17:28] and even the lady there don't give up on
[1:17:30] anyone is that right
[1:17:32] he said the lady that was he led to
[1:17:34] christ at 90 years old
[1:17:36] is that right and she was young and
[1:17:38] beautiful
[1:17:39] that's why i automotive and objective
[1:17:41] and one thing i loved what he said
[1:17:43] he said lord are these my converse he
[1:17:46] said when i'll go back then i'll preach
[1:17:48] like i never
[1:17:49] did before he said to win another
[1:17:51] million to your kingdom is that right
[1:17:54] that's why we're here for saints we're
[1:17:56] fulfilling the plan of redemption
[1:17:58] god sent this holy ghost this holy ghost
[1:18:01] it would lead it would guide you know
[1:18:03] all
[1:18:03] truth uh it was sin because it's our
[1:18:06] fortress
[1:18:06] it's our buckler it's our protector it's
[1:18:09] our teacher
[1:18:10] it's our counselor he will lead and he
[1:18:12] will guide you
[1:18:13] we got the best teacher in the world
[1:18:15] states just humble yourself
[1:18:17] be still and listen for that still small
[1:18:20] voice is that right
[1:18:22] that's that voice the holy ghost that
[1:18:24] enemy and he's speaking to you
[1:18:26] there and inside of you that seed that
[1:18:28] was planted there before the foundation
[1:18:30] of the world
[1:18:31] the god god is bringing us down saints i
[1:18:34] know i said it earlier but i'm telling
[1:18:35] you
[1:18:36] it's in manna this is special god have
[1:18:39] saved the best for last
[1:18:41] the way this word is being unfolded is
[1:18:43] that right
[1:18:44] the word is being unfolded to us now is
[1:18:47] because it's the holy ghost
[1:18:49] the holy ghost is in the beginning was
[1:18:51] the word the word was god the word was
[1:18:53] with god
[1:18:54] and the word was made flesh the holy
[1:18:56] ghost was sin so what
[1:18:57] so god can have fellowship once again is
[1:19:00] that right
[1:19:01] so that god now because we can refinish
[1:19:03] the plan of redemption
[1:19:05] that god has sent us here to do is that
[1:19:07] right
[1:19:08] and so that we can become what one with
[1:19:11] god against once again saints
